</div>These characters all belong to there original creators.<p>Bittersweet Memories  Chapter 2, Ranma, Elegy of a martial artist<p>-<p>It was three weeks since Shizuma Kusanagi arrived in Nerima and saved Ranko. In which times, he got acquainted with Akane, Kasumi, Nabiki, Nodoka, Soun and . He proceeded to get a haircut and a trim from Ranko's mother, which he protested, but she pointed out it would be easier to fight in. He reluctantly agreed and now wore his hair to right before the bottom of his neck, in the back it formed a spade, and he now has two eyebrows, much to Ranko's approval.<p>-<p>On the outskirts of Nerima, a giant panda followed closely behind a young red-haired female girl dressed in a red Chinese silk shirt, black pants and kung fu shoes, she also wore her hair in a pigtail. The rain was coming down hard, while most people carried umbrella's, the girl and panda just walked through the streets of Nerima. The pitter-patter of the rain and the peacefulness (which is usually chaos) of Nerima set the mood. The girl and panda's foot steps gently splashed small puddle while there was a sudden emphasis, causing the girl to run fast, even with the huge backpack she carried.<p>"Come on then!" She had just read a sign that said '(The faster we get to the Tendo Dojo, the faster we can see Ranko.)' (flip) '(So hurry up Ranma!)' The panda started running after the girl also, barely able to compete with the well-developed young girl.<p>-<p>At the Tendo Dojo, a very anxious Ranko and Nodoka. Ranko dressed in a blue kimono with designs of fishes swimming around the front, to the back and ending at the opposite side. Nodoka wearing a red kimono with pink sakura flowers only on the front, both of them were tied off by a white obi. The other three female members of the household weren't as excited when they heard a 'Ranma Saotome' would be there fiancé. Ranko assured them that her brother was a good person, but Nodoka wasn't so sure, Genma wasn't exactly the best parent ever. Nonetheless, Nodoka would be happy just to see her son again.<p>The two male members of the household were engaged in a intense round of Shoji. Soun had is usual atire of a green house robe. Shizuma had a white muscle shirt and black kungfu pants (think Ranma's pants), his blue jacket sat nearby, the fierce bright orange flames lining the bottom of the jacket.<p>Kasumi Tendo, the oldest daughter of 19, was busily working in the kitchen, preparing for her guest. She didn't mind cooking extra for Shizuma, who never stayed for free and always tried to help around there house as much as possible.<p>Nabiki Tendo, the middle daughter of 17, was sitting down at the table, her brown shoulder length hair hanging loosely down her head. She was dressed in a white T-shirt and yellow shorts, she was well absorbed into her manga.<p>Akane Tendo, the youngest daughter of 16, was busy cracking cement blocks, dressing in a yellow gi. Her blue hair was tied loosely in a yellow ribbon and stopped in the middle of her back. She wasn't that happy that a boy was coming here and her sparring partner was waiting for her brother. Akane didn't mind Shizuma that much though, at least he was polite, even if his eating and speech were a little underrated.<p>A knock at the door quickly caught all the residents attention. Before any of the could act, a high pitch voice could be heard.<p>"RANMA!" Ranko glomped onto the young girl, not noticing the red-hair or the panda, but Nodoka was looking very confused at this.<p>"RANKO!" Another female voice, coming from the girl, cried out. Ranko was also startled. One she found breasts and two, the voice was definitely female. She never saw this girl before, but those azure blue eyes were unmistakable for Ranma's.<p>"Who are you?" Ranko pointed at Ranma, while Nodoka walked out of the room to inform everyone they had guests.<p>"It's me Ranma." Ranma proceeded to whisper a few choice words. Ranko gasped and fell unconscious to the floor. The last thought that crossed her mind was interesting though.<p>'That means I have a brother and sister!' Ranma sighed and picked up Ranko, gently holding her in her arms. The panda walked behind the girl, now carrying the oversized pack. Everyone gasped as they saw a red-haired girl carrying an unconscious Ranko in her arms and a giant panda following closely behind. Shizuma promptly jumped up and grabbed Ranko from Ranma while she explained she had just fainted. Ranma scratched a spot behind her head ad bowed slightly.<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome. Sorry 'bout this." Soun then got Ranma into a hug, while Ranko soon stirred. Ranko blinked twice before she saw Soun pull Ranma out of the hug. Ranko promptly got up and went into the kitchen. She soon returned with a glass of hot water while Nodoka looked confused and Soun was busy crying waterfalls.<p>"Mo..." Ranma said those last words before the young red-haired girl was transformed into a handsome well-defined muscle structure with a black pigtail. Ranko then proceeded to glomp Ranma again with the Sister Glomp while everyone but the panda gasped.<p>"Ranma...?" Nodoka said while tears were forming in her eyes. Ranma, who was still enveloped into the Sister Glomp, started turning into an interesting shade of blue.<p>"Oh my! I do believe Ranma can't breath." This came from Kasumi, who was dressed into her usual attire of a white T-shirt and a yellow ankle length skirt, her brown hair hanging down her left shoulder with a yellow bow tied in it.<p>"Oh my!" Ranko promptly let go of Ranma to catch his breath, only to be caught into the Mother Glomp.<p>"Oh my Ranma! Your so manly!" Nodoka took the aspects of him turning into a half-girl a positive. After all, he must of learned more about a girl then any textbook could teach any other male. Ranma was turning into a purple shade this time.<p>"Can't...breath..." Nodoka let go of her son-daughter before wiping a few tears from her eyes. Nabiki thought it interesting, Kasumi seemed totally oblivious (except to Nodoka and Ranko, who now better) to the events, while Akane seemed very perturbed.<p>"Nodoka-san! How can you like your son! He's become a pervert!" Akane was about to argue and protest ever being engaged to a pervert like Ranma, but was promptly stopped by glares from Ranma, Ranko and Nodoka. She quickly shut her mouth wisely, while she still glared with a battle aura.<p>"How can you say that about my brother!" Ranko was starting to become distressed, as Nodoka was very disappointed in Akane. It didn't surprise her that much, as from recent stories from Ranko informed her of what's been going on in school.<p>"Akane." Nodoka put her motherly voice to work. "How can you say Ranma's a pervert?" Nodoka pointed to her son.<p>"Look at him! He can just change with water and become a girl! He can walk into a woman's restroom, public baths or a locker room!" Akane started to glow with a red battle aura, but stopped.<p>"Akane, why would he need to do any of that? All he needs is water and a mirror." Ranko crossed her arms across her chest, emphasizing her cleavage, which was a little bigger then Ranma's. A silence came over the residents currently at the Dojo before there were face-faults all around by the comment.<p>"I guess that's true...but he's still a boy! And I hate boys!" Akane proceeded to storm up the stairs while Ranko sweat-dropped.<p>"Poor Akane..." Ranma and Shizuma weren't listening. Nodoka was helping Kasumi in the kitchen, where Ranko was heading next. Nabiki went up the stairs to her room to begin plotting for her money schemes, while Genma, his wide round glasses, white gi and white bandana, where crying freely while chatting about 'joining the schools' and such.<p>"So Ranma. I hear yer a martial artist?" Ranma nodded with a grin.<p>"Why didja wanna know?" He asked Shizuma who was standing against the door frame with his arms crossed. Ranma finished his current kata and immediately continued into another one. Shizuma stood himself up and uncrossed his arms with a grin. He retrieved his jacket and proceeded to walk back out to the yard. The koi pond's water was gently rippling with the occasional cherry blossom. Small waves hit the sides of the rocks while the koi swam freely and without worry. Ranma was sitting on the ground meditating.<p>"Wanna spar?" Ranma cracked an eye open and stood up.<p>"Thought you'd never ask." Ranma stood himself up and proceeded to the right side of the yard, while Shizuma proceeded to the left. Ranko just walked out of the kitchen, patting down her hands with a white dishcloth when she noticed Shizuma and Ranma take up stances. She sighed and sat down near the edge of the walkway, waiting for the start of the battle.<p>Ranma took up a neutral stance, arms hanging loosely at his sides with his feet spread apart slightly. Shizuma had his left side facing Ranma, his right side facing away from Ranma. His right hand was facing Ranma, the right side of his palm facing towards Ranma while the left faced himself (like his stance). Shizuma's left hand was held the same way, but behind and lower then his right hand.<p>"What are you looking at Ranko?" Ranko turned and smiled when she saw her mother come outside to look at the yard. Nodoka smiled at the two warriors who were about to fight against each other.<p>"I do hope Ranma can stand up to your boyfriend." Ranko blushed a bright crimson color as she looked at the ground and twiddled her thumbs.<p>"Mom!" Nodoka just giggled at her daughter. "But it is true..." Ranko said the last sentence as quietly as she could, but Nodoka heard it anyways. Nodoka sat down with her daughter as they prepared to watch the battle unfold. Ranko snapped her fingers.<p>"Now I remember! Shizuma! Don't use any naikikou (1) techniques!" Shizuma glanced a look at Ranko (yes she is his girlfriend) and just nodded before looking back to Ranma.<p>'The first person who move will lose.' Both men mentally made this note and studied each other carefully. Nodoka looked at the two young men before turning back to Ranko, who was sitting silently watching the two.<p>"What's a naikikou technique?" Ranko looked at her mother before turning back towards the two standing men.<p>"Naikikou uses Chinese kikou (2). It gathers outside energy and forms it into your own power. Shizuma has one technique that names him 'A man of burning flame' and he lives up to it, unlike the 'Blue Blunder' of Furinkan Highschool." Nodoka nodded as she just noticed that everyone else in the house had joined them, looking on with expressions of confusion and interest.<p>"What's going on No-Chan?" Akane asked as she looked at the two combatants, who still haven't moved.<p>"Akane, the first one to move will lose." Soun glanced at his daughter who silently nodded to herself. Genma crossed his arms and quickly lost interest.<p>'Martial artist should just fight and get it over with. Not stand around and look at each other.' Genma nodded to himself before he went to go raid the kitchen. Slowly, a cherry blossom gently touched down on the surface of the koi pond, causing it to ripple. The two men disappeared in a blur before hearing a sonic boom. Both men reappeared quickly, appearing on opposite sides, both crouched low to the ground on one knee.<p>"What happened?" Akane shook her head. She couldn't follow what just happened.<p>"They were both sizing each other up. When the cherry blossom touched down" Ranko pointed to the small pink spade shaped leaf in the koi pond. "It was an invitation to fight. Both of the punched each other with incredible speed, causing a sonic boom to be heard." Akane gasped at this fact. She didn't know Ranma was that strong, or Ranko's boyfriend. Both men disappeared again, but reappeared in the middle of the yard exchanging blows.<p>Ranma punched towards Shizuma's chest, only to be brushed off by Shizuma's right arm. Shizuma delivered several quick kicks to Ranma's solar plexus, knocking him back on his feet before Ranma blurred again and delivered several more punches and kicks to Shizuma's mid-section. He tried to block most of them, but a few connected and knocked the wind out of them. Ranma successfully delivered a round house kick to Shizuma's right side of his head, sending him flying back into the fence.<p>"Whoa..." That was all Akane could say by the overall intensity of this battle. Ranko looked back and saw the expression on her face.<p>"There holding back for the most part. They don't want to destroy the surrounding area." Akane gasped. She knew that Shizuma was powerful, but she didn't know he was always holding back. Ranko giggled at the expression now on Akane's face.<p>"That was great Ranma." All looked to where Shizuma was now dusting himself off, effectively shrugging off the parts of wood still attached to him. Dust kicked up into the air and effectively disappeared. Ranma smiled before walking back into the house, followed closely by Shizuma. Everyone else went back to there usual duties around the house, or not usual duties.<p>"That was great Shizuma!" Ranko hugged Shizuma who returned her hug.<p>"Yeah yeah." He pushed her away and started popping muscles in his arms, twisting them around to loosen his joints. "There's somethin' 'bout that Ranma brother of yours." Ranko looked up to him with a questionable look.<p>"What do you mean?" She looked at Ranma who was teasing Akane about her macho ness. She felt something different about him though, it was only a miniscule feeling, but she definitely felt something different about him, something evil. She shrugged it off, he did spend 10 years with Genma anyways.<p>"He might be different because he spent so much time with my father. He isn't the best role model." They both laughed at the fact. They dodged several pieces of furniture as Ranma continued to tease Akane, who now were both outside.<p>"Think those two will ever get along?" She looked back up to Shizuma who shrugged, but then gasped. A loud crash was heard and then that feeling came back, but stronger this time. She turned to see Ranma with an extended fist. She shifted her gaze to see Akane lying in a heap of rubble in the side of the Tendo house. Ranma was slowly walking towards Akane, but Shizuma was near Akane before he could blink. Ranko rushed over towards the unconscious Akane, being there as fast as Shizuma was on Ranma.<p>"What your problem man?" Shizuma jabbed a thumb back to where Akane lie, surround by pieces of concrete.<p>"She said she wanted me to take her seriously." Ranma had a grin on his face. Shizuma looked disgusted, he couldn't believe this guy was related to Ranko. Of course, from what she said about her father before Ranma even went on the trip, he couldn't blame him for acting rash; she always told him that there father believed all girls to be weak.<p>Ranko picked Akane up and slung her over her shoulder and returned inside, where Soun was crying waterfalls.<p>"How could he!" Soun was busy turning the carpet into a giant washcloth. Ranko was about to return outside, but she quickly grabbed her favorite sword, wrapped in a red silk bundle tied with a silver band before returning outside. She returned to see Shizuma on the ground, blood flowing from a long gash on his face, staining the bright green grass. Ranma stood over him, his right hand dripping in blood.<p>"Weak." Ranko quickly untied the bundle and revealed her sword. It was a wooden sword, painted gold. It hand no hand guard and spiked up on the duller edge of the blade, making sort of a diamond shape and then it continued like a normal katana, straight for a few inches before slightly curving and then finishing off at the tip. It was about 40 inches also. She had just learned the Umi-Sen Ken technique not long after Shizuma arrived. She rid her presence from everyone's senses and blurred, faster then any eye could follow.<p>Ranma stared another punch, only to be blocked by a golden sword. It had the kanji for 'Wild Child' inscribed on both sides near the hilt of the blade, which was wrapped in training bandages.<p>"Stop Ranma..." Ranko had tears flowing from her eyes. Ranma quickly shook his head before blinking twice at the crying form of Ranko, blocking his fist with a gold sword. He noticed the unconscious Shizuma, blood flowing from a gash on his face and back to his own fist, which was dripping with blood.<p>"Wha..." He retracted his fist and watched Ranko go down to her boyfriend and try to stop the bleeding, tears flowing from her eyes. Shizuma stirred, only to see Ranko crying while she was trying to tied something to his head.<p>"That's not your brother..." He shook his head as soon as Ranko tied the bandages. Ranko picked up her sword and faced Ranma, who was looking very confused.<p>"Whada mean? Of course I'm Ranma." He pointed to himself, only to find Ranko disappear. The next thing he knew, he was unconscious.<p>"Your not my brother." The unconscious Ranma slowly floated upwards, followed by Genma. All the residents of the Tendo Dojo shielded there eyes, a swirling white light enveloped the two bodies, slowly at first, but getting faster with every moment. A loud bang was heard, followed by a shockwave, knocking Kasumi, Nabiki and Soun to there knees. Everyone looked again, only to be greeted by a different life form.<p>The 'life form' was very muscular, bulged out arms, legs, and neck. Two horns grew out of his black hair, which began to take on a gold color. His black skin changed with the growing shape of his body, becoming the scales of his skin. Two wings and a tail appeared, growing longer than his body. He touched the ground, his two feet now massive claws, the same for his hands. His form was now a black and gold dragon, towering over everyone at 25 feet tall... a shadow elemental draken.<p>"YOUR RIGHT. I AM NOT A MERE WEAKLING LIKE YOU HUMANS." Everyone gasped at the voice of the draken. Shizuma was the first to speak.<p>"Where's the real Ranma?" He pushed Ranko behind him, preparing to guard her with his life. Kasumi ran back into the house, idly going back to her work, she figured this didn't concern her much. Nabiki stumbled to her feet and rushed up to get her camera, this was some site. Akane just regaining consciousness, feel backwards with a looked of horror and confusion on her face, how can dragons be real?<p>"YAHHHH!" Everyone present turned to see another Ranma, dressed in the Red Chinese shirt, black kungfu pants, but this time the Ranma had a black pig-tail before instead of a red-pigtail that everyone saw earlier, from the first Ranma. Ranma had his right foot extended and his left foot bent back behind his thigh. Both his hands were tucked under his armpits with clenched fists.<p>"Get 'm my boy!" Everyone turned again to see the real Genma, dressed in a white gi, wide round glasses and a white bandana on his head. The draken extended his right arm and caught Ranma's extended foot. Ranma struggled to get free, kicking and punched the creature outstretched arm, hoping to get himself dropped. The draken extended his massive scaled wings, the evening sun shining beautifully of this massive creature of legend. His wing span reached 40 feet from tip to tip and beat his wings towards the ground, causing him to fly directly upwards.<p>The sudden burst of air caused everyone to stumbled back on there rears. Shizuma managed to step out of the way, causing himself to loose balance and fall himself, only to have Ranko fall on top of him, slightly ripping her kimono at the bottom. Soun feel backwards and hit the table in the family room (or whatever its called), causing him leave the world of consciousness. Genma stood there, arms crossed and did not falter, a disappointed look on his face. Akane just laid back and took the blast of wind.<p>The draken reached a certain height and stopped, 500 feet in the air, directly above the Tendo's koi pond.<p>"RANMA YOU HAVE BEEN A NUSIANCE FOR FAR TOO LONG." The dragon snorted, releasing small twin flames from both nostrils, smoke following shortly there after. The dragon reared his head back with an ear-splitting roar. He extended his right arm straight into the air, lifting the fighting Ranma straight above the dragons head, the scales glimmering in the sunlight, making the black scales to seem majestic.<p>"Ryuunosuke. You know we shall meet again." The dragon snorted again, releasing twin clouds of smoke from his nostrils. Ryuunosuke knew this human was stronger then most of the fragile ones he met, there bones and spirits were easily crushed. Ryuunosuke abruptly threw his arm downwards with a tug and released Ranma. Seconds later, an audible 'pop' was heard, effectively sounding the breaking of the sound barrier.<p>Ranma did a flip in the air and glared back at Ryuunosuke, who snorted, releasing twin clouds of smoke from his glimmering scaled nose. Ranma looked down and sighed. A loud audible crash was heard, making water, rocks and fish blow outwards from where the koi pond used to be.<p>Water raised up and came down with a gentle trickle, not causing much damage. The rocks rained down, very hard at that. Shizuma covered Ranko's body with his own, protecting her from the rocks. Bruises and cuts formed, while blood leaked out from the sides of his upper body, arms and legs. Tears wielded up in Ranko's eyes, while Shizuma only smirked.<p>"Anythin' for you..." Shizuma stood there and took the punishment of the large rock that formed the koi pond continued to pound his back, while Kasumi strode under the awning nonchalantly, placing buckets near the outside. A few koi started to come down, only to be caught in buckets (somehow, they had come at an angle and somehow landed into the buckets, gotta love anime physics).<p>A crater now formed where the koi pond used to be. The grass abruptly stopped at the edge of the crater, which looked to be 15 feet by 15 feet. A battered Ranma lay in the middle of the crater, almost all of his clothes ripped to shreds. A few pieces of red and black cloth surrounded the downed martial artist, while his breathing was slow and shallow. Shizuma stood up and bent back, arcing himself towards the sky where Ryuunosuke stood hovering. Blood slowly seeped from man cuts and bruised and stained the ground beneath him read.<p>"Ryuunosuke..." Shizuma fainted and abruptly feel backwards, making an abrupt splash with the mixture of blood and water. Neither of the two martial artists moved, only breathed slowly. Ranko burst into tears and headed towards Ranma while Kasumi was already taking care of Shizuma.<p>"Ranma..."<p>-<p>That's it for the second chapter. I'm such a bastard for leaving such a cliff hanger. I will probably end it soon, but if you read it and like it, please send comments to my e-mail address and I might consider doing a sequel after it ends or continuing using the same name.<p>(1). Naikikou are inside spirit techniques, plan and simple. If you've read Realbout Highschool, you know what this is, if now, I'll explain it later.<p>(2). Nikou is a method of controlling your internal chi. This will also happen during later chapters. It's easier to explain in action.<p>Aqualens: Ranko isn't like Ryoko, other then learning Kendo. And about her not being able to defend herself, she was coming back from the grocery store and she didn't want to have to go back and get more groceries, or she would of kicked there ass. And about the monobrow, in the manga he does have a monobrow. If you look closely, you can see both his eyebrows connected by hair, even if it's not a lot.<p>NL Kaos: You'll see.
