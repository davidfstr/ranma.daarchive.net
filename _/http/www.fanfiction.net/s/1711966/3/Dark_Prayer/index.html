</div><p><b>Dark Prayer</b></p><p>By: X-Zero</p><p>Disclaimer: I don't own  Ranma ½, those characters belong to Rumiko Takahashi.</p><p><b>Chapter 3-  Call My Name</b></p><p>Ranma looked up to the  body he had just sent off into unconsciousness, the feelings that had  been swirling around in his mind constantly, he having been  reflecting on his actions today, he'd been attacking his opponents  with more than enough force, he'd been putting them down brutally,  unlike him normally, now he wondered what was happening to him, life  seemed to be going out of control, he wondered idly if it were his  new fighting style. Realizing that he had struck Akane hard enough to  send her into the wall without much more than a gentle push he felt  was strange, he knew he was strong, but he'd only ever felt this  strong when fighting opponents with a much greater overall power than  himself.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Yuka, watched in  amazement as she saw Akane flung bodily into the wall, strangely  enough, she'd seen it all, Ranma was merely eating and had lifted his  hand to her, and a shove that would normally look to put him out of  mallet range had sent her flying. She limped over to the pigtailed  martial artist, wondering what had changed in him to cause that sort  of power.<p>"Ranma?" She  whispered quietly, to herself more than anything else. She was  trembling, afraid for the pigtailed teen; afraid of whatever it was  that had happened to him to cause this drastic change. As he peered  up at her from below his bangs, she saw the fear that quickly  vanished from his eyes, while not a martial artist, Yuka knew how to  read people, it came with being Akane's friend, one had to know what  subjects to avoid, as not to earn her rage.</p><p>"I'm sorry you got  hurt because of me, it shouldn'tve happened." He said bowing his  head once more, feeling like a complete fool. He'd thought that  things would've gotten better, that the cycle of trouble would end if  he started taking things seriously, but they weren't changing. He  pushed off the cot, the last bits of his lunch left behind in the  bento.</p><p>"I gotta take the tomboy to doc's place, I hope you'll be  okay." He said lifting Akane over his shoulder in a fireman's  carry, before launching out the open window. Yuka could only watch as  he went, having seen the pain in his eyes and the anger, the sorrow  and fear that hide in those grey-blue orbs, she shook her head softly  and grabbed crutches, heading toward class.</p><p>Ranma was just a few  meters short of Tofu's clinic when an unwelcome sight reached his  weary eyes, the idiots.</p><p>Genma and Soun were on  their way out to a bar (A/N: Hey, I doubt they're decent enough to  wait for nightfall to get smashed) when they caught sight of Ranma,  he was carrying Akane, and she looked to be stirring from sleep. They  both stopped in their tracks, they'd wait, hiding to see things  unfold. Genma dove behind a car, Soun somehow managed to conceal  himself behind a streetlight.</p><p>Ranma felt his uncute  fiancée waking on his shoulder, and so he set her down  roughly.</p><p>"C'mon you tomboy, wake up. I don't wanna have ta carry  you anymore." He said agitatedly, his eyes showing his anger at  her. She woke and looked up at her unwanted fiancée, burning  rage clouding her eyes over as she recalled what had sent her  tumbling off into the world of unconsciousness. She stood shakily,  her head still spinning slightly, but not so much that she would be  put off from punishing the fool, he'd had no right hitting her,  punishments from her were divine mandate, didn't he know! She'd show  him, calling up her anger and rage into her mallet, she brought it  down, lunging at him, intent on pounding him into a puddle, and than  playing pound the puddle.</p><p>Ranma watched bored as  the aura grew, and than shaped itself into a mallet, watching Akane  as she dashed for him, mallet raised overhead. He waited arms by his  sides as she reached him, waiting, and waiting, NOW! Ranma flashed  forward, smashing the mallet with a back fist, dissipating the ki  construct with his own more powerful glowing fist.</p><p>"That's  enough, if you wanna fight, than we'll fight, But I ain't gonna just  dodge this time. He said hopping back and powering up his aura, the  earphones glinting as they came to life, along with their companion.  He noticed out of the corner of his eye, two figures rushing him from  behind, body acting before his mind he leapt into the air, clearing  his assailants easily, rebounding off the lamppost to land behind  them, he, just scant meters away from his original goal saw his  father, if one could give him such a title, and Soun. They were  attacking him, screaming about his fiancée or something of the  like, he didn't care.</p><p>"Boy, apologize to  your fiancée at once." Genma went on, wailing about his  ungrateful son.</p><p>"How dare you strike at my little girl,  apologize this instant." Soun ranted, having invoked his demon  head. Ranma grinned,</p><p>"Beat me and you'll get your wish, but be  warned, I will not hold back against you." He stated calmly,  shocking them. He'd just delivered them an invitation, who would they  be to pass up such an opportunity, never mind the intensity he'd just  shown or the strange glow in the young martial artist's eyes.</p><p>He said loudly, powering  up his battle aura, the red aura sprang out of his form and then  shrunk until it was an intense outline against his body. His normal  cocky smirk was replaced by a feral grin.</p><p>"Worthless boy, you  will apologize to your fiancée this instant." He said,  angrily, and launched himself towards his progeny.</p><p>Ranma and his father  clashed midair, the older man taking a brutal flying kick to the  chest, just as his son did, the elder Saotome, however, was  completely unprepared for what followed. Instead of trading blows as  would usually occur the pigtailed martial artist fired a small ki  blast directly into his opposition's chest, sending him sprawling to  the cold ground. Ranma calmly landed from the initial clash, awaiting  the incoming attack from the crybaby.</p><p>"Ahhhh!" Soun  had been out of practice for quite some time, but he was far from  over the hill. He dashed forward, right past his friend who he was  forced to jump over to avoid. Almost immediately he was upon Ranma,  striking out with fists and feet in what to any other would be a  tremendously quick 15 attack combo. His moves were quick and  powerful, buzzing by the Saotome heir by inches. Unfortunately for  him, Ranma proved as he had time and again, that he was no ordinary  fighter. He weaved in and out of the older man's attacks with  irritating ease. Even as the last hit came close enough to strike, it  was blocked solidly by a blue bracer. He looked up into his would be  son-in-law's eyes, and was unnerved by the cold glare he received. He  was further entranced by the angry red glow in the teen's eyes as he  was suddenly finding himself thrown bodily into his just recovering  friend, the both of the tumbling to the asphalt.</p><p>Ranma growled as his  energy gathered in what was certainly going to put one of the aging  martial artists out of this fight. He charged forward, leading foot  digging a hole into the ground from the sheer power behind the simple  step.</p><p>To the old men, who were  quickly back on their feet, it looked like the angry young man had  disappeared, a red glow which was growing all too steadily closer.  Fear ruled their minds as they realized what it was and turned to  run. For Soun, darkness was welcome, that rage filled blast had been  a form of torture that had only been brought by the man he called  master. For Genma, on the other hand, it was pain, pure and simple.  He got to his feet on unsteady legs, shuffling into a stance again;  it'd take more than that for him to be put down.</p><p>Akane had blinked back  her shock right around the time that Ranma had downed her father the  second time, the longer lasting of the two occurrences.</p><p>"YOU  BASTARD, HOW DARE YOU HIT MY DAD?" She yelled as a crimson  bonfire sprung up around her, solidifying long enough to coalesce  into a war hammer of immense size. With the glowing grip held firmly  in her hands, she ran forward with every ounce of rage driven speed  she could muster. It would not be enough.</p><p>Ranma had just finished  with the two men, if such a title were applicable to the worms, when  he felt a tingle, his danger sense. He turned around to see Akane  coming at him with a new toy; this mallet was larger than any of her  previous manifestations. She had the heavy construct hefted above her  head and was about to bring it down on him when he dropped into a  crouch, his fist seeming to catch fire as his aura drained from the  rest of his body and condensed around it. He smiled a demonic grin  that would not be soon forgotten, and was just about to strike her  when her aura disappeared, along with her mallet. She fell from her  towering position to the ground, boneless.</p><p>"Huh?" He  wondered aloud, attempting to leap out of the way of his father's  attack a moment to late, and was clipped in the calf by the ki  enhanced strike. The punch sent him spinning midair, careening toward  a building. Were it not for the fact that he was a midair specialist,  Ranma would've landed poorly. As it was he was righted himself and  landed crouched against the wall's vertical surface. He cried out his  attack as his, oyaji came into point blank range.</p><p>"Inferuno  Renda!" Several orbs of ki shot from his once again flame  covered hands. Genma's vitals took an unprecedented pounding. He too  followed his emotionally unstable friend, and said friend's daughter  into the land of dreaming. With the old man disposed of...</p><p><i>thump</i></p><p>...he could now  concentrate on whatever had taken down his unwanted fiancée.  Pivoting on his undamaged leg he found himself a bit of a distance  from a figure completely coated in a dark cloak. Though obviously  female, she was not of the right height or overall shape as any woman  he knew, perhaps she was a new fiancée, challenger, or perhaps  a bit of both, he didn't particularly care so much as he wanted to  know what she was doing here, and why she helped him.</p><p>"Sleep mode" He  vocalized, causing the MP3 unit to return to its dormant state, it'd  need rest tonight. He had to admit, the stream of music had helped in  the creative process, and he'd concentrated much better, and didn't  give up much. He had been able to revise his moves quickly and  efficiently, the appropriate attacks for each situation coming to  mind when he needed them. He quickly shook his thoughts clear; he  needed answers from this female before anything else.</p><p>"Who are you?"  He put forth not so subtly. He'd never really been that good with  beating around the bush, and it showed in his speech patterns. The  cloaked figure could almost be heard frowning.</p><p>"You already know  the answer to that question. The better question is: Who are you?"  She responded, before bounding to a rooftop and dashing off, powerful  strides carrying her quickly across the rooftops. Ranma made the leap  to follow, but found nothing of the woman on the horizon. Searching  with his ki senses brought nothing he didn't already know from  looking, she was gone. He hung his head in defeat when he noticed  something shining in the afternoon sun, it was a necklace. It was  half of the yin/yang symbol, particularly the male of the two pieces.  As he scanned over the small piece of jewelry he noticed that in  place of the customary dot of the opposite color, there was a small  character. Though he knew it was not Kanji, he felt that he knew what  it meant. It was than that he noticed a note tagged to it.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma,<p>Please take this  necklace; though you don't know me anymore, you know that we have met  before, and that I am your friend. I only hope that this might help  you regain something of the memory you have lost. And you are right,  it isn't written in Kanji. It can only be said that we will  undoubtedly meet again, when you remember who I am, and who you are.</p><p>Until you  remember,</p><p>A Friend</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma looked at the  necklace in his hand, and again at the note. He knew the small thing  was his, and found a certain familiarity with it. He sighed and  slipped the jewelry around his neck, tucking it under his shirt. He'd  hide the small thing, as it was undoubtedly worth a great deal of  yen, if his appraisal was correct, just as with the music device,  he'd hide it from Genma. He looked around at the ground below him and  shook his head, his pigtail swinging slightly even as it swayed in  the breeze that belonged to none but him.<p>"Fools, they thought  they could dominate me, dominate a man undefeated by even the gods? I  pity their ignorance." He said, as his eyes seemed to mature  slightly for the moment, before he bounded off into the setting sun.</p><p>To Be Continued...</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Techniques Translation:</b></p><p><b>Ryuusei Ame:</b> Meteor Rain,  an anger empowered extreme speed punch attack that utilizes ki-blasts  that burst into the victim/recipient upon contact.</p>
