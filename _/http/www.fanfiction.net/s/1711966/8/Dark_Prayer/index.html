</div><p>The rising sun shone  against the figure of Ranma as he sat perched on the edge of his  roof. "I can't let anyone be hurt by this Bison guy, but if he  can mess with you mind, what am I gonna do? I don't want the Neko-Ken  to get a chance to get loose." His thoughts drifted off, and he  decideed to sit down, his thoughts would be of no use if he couldn't  focus them. So he sat in meditation, focusing himself enough to reach  the area of his mind that was the containment for the Neko-Ken.  "Reiko, upcoming is a battle, one that will push us to our  current limits, I..." He paused, unsure of how to ask himself  for help. "I need to find a training method, one that will give  me an edge, I already know that I am strong enough to face this guy.  But I don't want his ability to manipulate the mind to affect me.  Is.. is there anything that can be done to hold the Neko-Ken in  check?" He asked his mind, while inspecting the dark pulsing  sphere that represented his repression of the Neko-Ken the barrier  that held the maliciousness and dark power that would consume him if  it failed before he was prepared. A combination, he realized, of his  subconscious usage of Reiko's, or rather, his power, and his own  conscious will. He put one hand against that wall, against the raw  unholy strength. He knew that upon attaining mastery of his new  strength, or is it old strength? that he would be able to defeat this  thing, and knew even further that he was near finding the key.</p><p><b>Dark Prayer 8</b>- Life</p><p>By:XZero and Paul</p><p>Disclaimer:I don't own  Ranma 1/2, Takahashi-sama does.</p><p>Addressing a couple  reviews:</p><p><b>Ranger5:</b> Thank you for  your review, it means a lot that an author of your skill has given a  good review of my work.</p><p><b>Dwaje:</b> With no little  amount of hostility, I have only to say that, until you write  something, and make it worth reading, you have no right to tell me  how to spin a tale. If you don't like reading it, find something  else. I write because I enjoy it, and figure someone else out there  might share enjoyment in my creativity.</p><p>Sakura lifted her head,  wondering where she was. She could've sworn she had dreamt of falling  out a window. She pulled the covers up some more, and snuggled deeper  into her bed... Wait, the last thing she remember doing was fighting  Chun-Li, and passing out. But where could she? Who found her? She  cracked her eyes open, groaning as the light flittering in through  the window.</p><p>"Wha..." She groaned, eyes evening out and  looking around the room where she had awoken. She nearly immediately  spotted Ranma's pack and guitar. "Ranma's place?" She  recalled now her exact location. If Ranma's things were here then she  was in a small apartment building on the southern edge of town, near  enough to both his workplace and their training yard, a place that  had been condemned and abandoned, the demolition crew had been so  thankful for the pair, as their sparring had destroyed much of the  building, and had finished their job much faster than they had  expected, allowing them to take on more contracts. They had offered  the fighters some money to help them clear away more of the ruined  parts of town, and had been accepted hastily.</p><p>Sakura realized that  she was very safe, and found that with this knowledge she could rest.  Curling up once again she closed her eyes and prepared to drift off  into sleep, but before she faded into slumber, she extended her  senses just to doubly assure her of things. Feeling Ranma's aura  coming from above she nodded to herself, that was until she read the  distress in it, after finding this, she wondered what could cause the  very carefree man to worry as much as he was. That and the dark spot  she found while probing his aura bothered her, this had never  appeared before during a conflict, so she had never looked into it.  So, he does have demons from his past. I wonder what caused this  darkness? She asked, not finding a darkness of the aura to be any  true , when one's herod a style that was based off of  killing intent, how could a bit of darkness stand out truly? She  pulled herself to sit up in bed, noting the bandages around her  wounds, wrapped expertly.</p><p>Ranma for his part was  still sitting calmly on the roof when he began to smell the light  scent of breakfast wafting up from his apartment. Curious as to who  was cooking, though he knew it couldn't have been Chun-Li, he pushed  forward, and inverted himself into a handstand on the edge of the  roof, twisting around and throwing himself through his open window.  He landed in a crouch in the bedroom, silently as not to bother the  still sleeping Chun-Li. He stretched out his ki, and found Sakura in  his mini kitchen, and knew she was cooking. He'd learned that she was  an okay cook, as she had learned during her search for Ryu, and it  was okay not to run screaming off into the night when she offered to  prepare dinner. Unlike certain parts of my old life.</p><p>Sakura had gotten hungry  sometime while she was waiting for Ranma to return, and had wandered  into the kitchen. She had just finished with the cooking when she  sensed someone behind her, the immediate reaction to spin and drop  into a stance was halted as she instinctively looked out with her  third 'eye.' She grinned as she felt the familiar aura of Ranma, the  dark spot reflecting his owrries gone, replaced with the warm glow of  confidence.</p><p>"Food'll be ready in a moment." She said,  deflating her pigtailed friend's attempt at spooking her.</p><p>"Go  wake Chun-Li please." She stated as she began serving the food  into bowls. Ranma only got a slightly annoyed look on his face before  heading back into the bedroom and doing as she instructed.</p><p>Chun-Li Xiang awoke to the  pleasant smell of food, and couldn't find it in her to complain about  this, she was dreadfully hungry and hoped that food would help her to  contemplate her situation. She, one of the last of the street  fighters around to combat Bison, and she had foolishly gotten hurt.  She turned to look at the source of her food moments later, and  noticed that it was being offered to her by Ranma, someone who had  proven to be a martial artist of at least some caliber. At the  thought of the young man an idea began to form in her mind. Their  conversation during the night had started this, and she believed that  she'd need to ask Sakura about it.</p><p>"Thank you." She said  mildly, her thoughts bouncing around, trying to decide what to do,  she couldn't afford for Bison to win this. The world couldn't afford  such a thing.</p><p>"Well I'm heading off  ta work now, see you both later, and Sakura, keep her in bed, she  needs ta let her leg have some rest." Ranma said as he  disappeared out the door, his footsteps nonexistent as he left, a  toolbelt hanging uncharacteristically around his waist. He was headed  out to the job site where he was currently still an apprentice, this  job would be the last of his tests before his final written exam,  once that was through, he'd have a license to build anything anywhere  in the country. He was still working on the last few months before he  could take the finals exam for his physical education degree. Once  that was through he could teach as a master of his own school, the  last message from Happosai confirming that he would indeed have a  certificate of mastery waiting for him upon his return.</p><p>The pigtailed warrior  arrived at the job, and seeing that he was on time, tightened his  toolbelt and leapt to his foreman's location. Tou watched as he  completed the leap and smiled at him, he had grown to consider the  young man as a son, or perhaps a nephew. He looked over the young  man, noting the changes in him since their first meeting, instead of  the green yet somehow weary young man he'd seen before, the one who  didn't look anything like the lighthearted, if sincere, fellow he was  now. This one gave an air of maturity, he felt that the boy had grown  much since his arrival. He quickly gave him his assignment and sent  him on his way, telling him that he'd send someone to check on him  shortly. Ranma had of course started quickly, pausing only as the  sneeze disturbed his balance for a second.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sakura and Chun-Li sat in  Ranma's bedroom, talking about a variety of things, such as Sakura's  training, and shortly thereafter, about Ranma, how good was he, and  so on and so forth. The air got unconfortably silent, however, as the  chinese woman mentioned Bison, and the insane man's imminent arrival  in Japan. Sakura had caught the unspoken reference to asking Ranma  for help, as the other street fighters had either been incapacitated  or isolated, or even, in Ryu's case, kidnapped and brainwashed. Her  thoughts turned to the amazing feats of martial skill she's witnessed  from Ranma and has it firm within her mind that he is just as, if not  better than the man she wanted to learn from, the one who would give  her the ultimate bliss, from the sweet song of battle. Sakura had  been incredibly impressed by her progress in her training, her  imperfect style was never enough to beat Chun-Li, yet she had done  it, in the process she had exhausted herself, but that was something  she had accepted, that even with the impressive increase she had  experienced since meeting Ranma and being pushed by someone better  than her, being pushed hard. She smiled and as she found something to  say to the older woman about it.<p>"Tell him that you need help,  tell him everything, and he'll help us, I know it." Their  conversation degenerated from there into random female banter.</p><p>As it turned out, he had  been intended on talking to them about the troubles ahead after work  that day, as he believed that not helping in this conflict would be  worse than killing all those innocents himself. Chun-Li had spent the  rest of the day looking for information, finding out the specifics of  Bison's visit to the land of the rising sun.</p><p>The following week were  quiet and peaceful, only serving to amaze both Ranma and Chun-Li, he  for the amount of quiet he was getting, not even his time at the  monastery had been as uneventful as this past week. His time was  consumed between work, meditation, and physical training. Each day he  felt the powers of the Neko-Ken getting slightly larger, as his own  limitations shrank, each day a little more of his power was coming  under his control, the agonizing part was that it was almost  complete, then there would only be the retraining of his body to  handle the gross amount of energy. Chun-Li though, she was learning  more about the pigtailed man than she wanted, his power was amazing,  and she could tell that his reserves far exceeded what he was capable  of showing with mere katas. His forms were perfect, flawless in  execution, though what scared her was his ability to completely  disapear from view, fading from sight for minutes on end. She  believed that he could do it.</p><p>Peace, something that  could never last, regardless of the endless fight for it, was lost  that morning. Ranma had risen to begin his morning training, while  Sakura could only watch, he having asked her to tend to Chun-Li for  now. His senses twitched as he felt something on the edge of his  perception, someone was watching him, he could feel it, the slight  heat of eyes on his back. He stopped in his meditation and expanded  his aura, reaching out to find his 'fan.' There, he decided, as he  initiated the technique that had become as familiar to him as the  Amaguriken.</p><p>"Munashii Zenkai" He whispered and faded from  sight.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Just last week Ichiro  Koboyashi gotten a call from his boss, oddly enough it wasn't the man  who usually gave him orders. No it was the head of the organization  for which he worked. He had been so excited by this chance to advance  in his career he had almost missed the man telling him to find out  everything he could about a man named Ranma in Kyoto, Japan. This  didn't surprise him, he had been searching for strong fighters for  his boss for 4 years now, extending invitations to them, or if need  be, sending them to meet their ancestors. He figured finding a man  without a surname in Japan would be easy, and a man with a unique  name such as<p>"Ranma" couldn't possibly be any harder. He  only needed half the time alotted to find him, and the rest had been  spent finding suitable places to watch the man from, every time he'd  believed himself a safe distance, the man would notice him, but  ignore the him without a second thought it seemed.</p><p>Today was the day he made  a mistake, the boss wanted to meet this one personally, tomorrow no  less, he had though he was far enough, but when the man disappeared  during his meditation, he knew he was in trouble. He took 5 seconds  to absorb the man's disappearance, and that was all the time it took  for the pigtailed man to reach him. Before he knew what was happening  he felt fingers curl around his throat, felt himself lifted off the  roof he had been watching from. His binoculars dropped from his hands  and his eyes met chips of sapphire.</p><p>"Who are you, and what do  you want?" The man he'd been sent to watch snarled at him, his  eyes burning into his head. His thoughts were a mile a minute, what  would the man do with him, but one thing was for sure, he wasn't  being paid well enough to get himself killed.</p><p>"Lord Bison sent  me." He choked, knowing that he'd be hunted, but at least he had  a chance of survival. He almost wet himself when Ranma's stare bore  deeper into his eyes, grabbing ahold of his very core.</p><p>"Take me  there." He said, tossing the man down, and keeping his blazing  stare on him. The man thought that this was a good time to try to fix  this situation. He was supposed to extend an invitation to this one.  So why not give him the information.</p><p>"He wanted to meet you  tomorrow, outside of town, the forest northeast of here. You'll know  the place when you find it." He was worried, this guy was  amazingly powerful, stronger it seemd than that Ryu guy that Bison  had gone to such great lengths to get. He'd have to let him know if  he survived the encounter with this enraged fighter.</p><p>Bison sat in his throne,  waiting eagerly his latest interests arrival, he should arrive just  as his new form was prepared. With Ryu's body he'd be able to  increase in power exponentially. His thoughts turned sour as his mind  came to focus on the image of a strikingly beautiful blonde haired  woman. Cammy White, his greatest achievement in his experiments for a  new body, unfortunately, his creation had been too perfect, gaining  far too much independence. The phone in his throne rang, disrupting  his thoughts and annoying him slightly, as all interuptions to his  greatness did. (A/N: He is an arrogant psychopathic egomaniac  afterall)</p><p>"Yes, what is it?"  His deep voice rang with power as his ire rose.</p><p>"Sir, we just got a  report that Ken Masters has reached Japan after finding the main base  in Thailand lacking your presence. He seems to be using every  resource at his disposal to find you. I believe he will find this  place soon, tomorrow if his latest efforts have been any indication."  Bison's eyes glowed angrily at his lackey's words.</p><p>"Hmm, well then,  prepare for battle, as our guests should arrive soon." His  insane laughter filled the line, sending shudders down the spine of  all who heard the reverberating tone.</p><p>"Yes sir." The  line went dead as the base was prepped for combat, all guard units  were on an increased duty rotation, keeping them fresh for combat at  all times, all operations short of the preparations for Bison's  rebirth in Ryu halted for the time being. These next few days would  be interesting.</p><p>"Interesting indeed."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sword katas were very  usually strict patterns of movement, disciplined and unbending, this  was not the case this early morning. Ranma was moving in a dual sword  form, his blades moving in beautiful harmony. His was a chaotic dance  of rippling air, the strokes of the magnificent metal gleaming in the  morning light. A blonde man had arrived at his home last night  looking for Sakura, he had said his name was Ken Masters. The  youthful man with a hard look in his eyes had quickly been invited  in, which threw him for a loop. Last nights events had been swirling  in his mind since then, but one thing was for sure, this was it.<p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>"Sakura, don't you  live with your parents?" Ken voiced, wondering, and a little  worried for her, afterall, can't let Ryu's fangirl/friend, be hurt by  some strange guy. Speaking of him... His thoughts trailed off  momentarily as he thought about the extreme feeling of darkness he  got from his aura like he had done something horrible in order to  attain the massive, although passive, aura of power. It felt as if  his aura was just a natural part of the surroundings, almost as if he  were a human force of nature. Ryu'd love to face this guy, his power  is incredible. He pushed aside these thoughts though for the moment,  they needed to know what he was here for, and Ryu needed his help. He  wouldn't fail his friend who had helped him selflessly so many times.</p><p>"I know where Bison's  base is, in fact, it's buried in the mountain just outside of town. I  think he'll be expecting us, Sakura you were going to come right?"  Ken knew the answer, she had been searching for the man who could  teach her so much through a fight, and she was determined to get it,  and help the one who inspired her to become what she has, a   only answer was a nod from her while she looked to Ranma  questioningly.</p><p>"Um, Ranma right?" A slight nod was his  response.</p><p>"Are you going to come with us, you don't have any  personal stake in this, so why do it?" He asked tentatively, the  maturity that had rubbed off on him from his training partner and  best friend was showing through at the moment, he wanted Ranma to  know why he was risking his life.</p><p>Ranma was actually a bit  shocked at the twenty-something blonde man asking him that, but his  answer was already there, he had been thinking about it for a while  now.</p><p>"I'm going to end a threat that has Sakura-chan so scared,  I'm going to be rid of someone who poisons innocent people to gain  money to hurt people. I'm tired of watching people hurting, I've seen  enough, and it ends. If what I've heard of Bison is true, then he is  a monster, preying on the innocent, and exploiting the foolish. I  won't let it continue. Besides, I'm going to help my friend to save  hers." He stated all of this solemnly, his mind made completely,  he knew his words weren't very articulate, and probably didn't make  much sense, but he understood, and it shone in his eyes as his power  leapt to rise to his growing ire at such a monster.</p><p>Ken was shocked, his  ambient power had doubled then for a moment, and his eyes had flashed  with restrained energy, but even scarier was that he had changed, he  had seen something enter his eyes as he spoke, and watched the  transformation between carefree student of the art to the calculating  glare of a hardened warrior. He nodded dumbly, agreeing with the  pigtailed man's statement, he would prove to help greatly, Ken could  feel it.</p><p><i>End Flashback</i></p><p>The last movement of this  particular kata ended with both blades glowing and in a scissor slice  to the throat, which sent a pair of crossed scarlet blades rocketing  through the air, directed at the metal post ten feet away.</p><p>"Kurenai  Ken." Ranma stated without inflection. The post's head was  seemingly undamaged, and the blades were crossed and flipped  together, causing the darker of the two, the one in his left hand, to  fade away, causing the lighter to darken on one side. This singular  blade made a smooth and short trip to the sheath, ending the kata.  His eyes opened and he smiled at his accomplishment.</p><p>"There  wasn't any damage to it, I don't get it." Came the voice of  Chun-Li, she'd never seen a ki blast/blade, do nothing. Ranma only  smiled as he pointed at the metal post, and grinned wide as the top  section showed lightly glowing scars in the same cross pattern as the  attack.</p><p>"Wow, that's amazing, you must have excellent control to  make the blades just powerful enough to cut through, leaving a  semi-liquified metal behind. I never imagined the benefits of  controlling ki to that extent." She marveled for a bit on that,  wondering what benefits improving her control over her extensive ki  techniques would bring. It was easy to imagine that her powered  kicking techniques would be more efficient, and less tiring. She let  the matter slip to the back of her mind as she realized that it  wouldn't matter until her leg healed. She moved back into the  apartment, the soft click of her crutches the only sign of her  passing.</p><p>Ranma remained outside,  staring up at the sky and wondering if he'd see it again after  tomorrow. These next few hours could likely be the last remnents of  peace that he would get for a while, he could feel it.</p><p>To Be Continued...</p><p>A/N:I hadn't planned to  end this chapter so quickly, but as it turns out I figure that this  would set the foreboding tone of the next chapter, which will be an  assault on Bison's base, and soon to be the final battle with Bison.  I figured though that I would keep somewhat with canon continuity of  SF and have only Ken and Sakura involved in the assault, along with  the divergence of Ranma's assistance. Anyhow the translations...</p><p>Munashii Zenkai- Void  Armageddon: This technique is achieved by harnessing ki without the  emotional filter, making the output of energy more powerful. The  technique makes the body extremely durable, and increases speed. The  technique can encompass the entire body, or any particular area that  is wished. The technique can be used to increase endurance, as it  fortifies the user against the extreme stress the speed gained.</p><p>Kurenai Ken- Crimson  Blade: This technique is used by filling the striking edge of a  weapon with ki, and during the attack, directing it. The blades are  projected forward by momentum, traveling a good distance if fully  powered.</p>
