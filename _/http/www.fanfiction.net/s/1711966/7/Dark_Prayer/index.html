</div><p>And  he walked away, leaving behind friends who had, in the time he was  with them, become as brothers, maybe one day he'd return, to visit  with the men of this place.</p><p><b>Dark  Prayer</b></p><p>By:X-Zero</p><p>Disclaimer:  Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi and whoever produces it, Street  Fighter, Sakura, Chun-Li, M. Bison, and Colonel Guile all belong to  Capcom and their affiliates</p><p><b>Chapter  7- Belonging</b></p><p>Traveling  the country, even on foot as the young man was doing, was costly. The  pigtailed young man had spent a great deal of his money on a few  investment tips that he'd gotten from a conversation Nabiki had been  having with one of her flunkies, that investment was holding steady  and would hopefully rise in value. He would need that money to  produce more if he was going to start a new life. He'd long ago sworn  to never be like his father, and felt that learning the things he  believed could be useful given his unique talent for property damage  would also benefit him with a job if he ever ran out of money and was  in need of it. This had led him to Kyoto, where the construction  workers of Nerima had learned their craft. The speed, and skill of  these workers were boasted to be the best in their industry and had  easily drawn the pigtailed warrior's attention.</p><p>The  building was nothing special, a sparsely furnished and simple place  of brick and mortar consisting of a partially constructed building  standing three stories above the single floored main building.</p><p>"Excuse me, is this the Kyoto Construction Union?" The  young pigtailed man asked meekly, knowing that he was a novice to  them, in their trade at least. The only other one in the reception  area was a tall, barrel chested man who looked to be in his late  fourties, with arms like logs and legs lean and sturdy.</p><p>"Yeah,  you got the right place kid, what can I do for ya?" He asked  raising a brow to look the younger man over. Funny, he couldn't  possible want to learn the trade, could he? He thought to himself  while appraising Ranma.</p><p>"I was looking for someone who could  tell me where I applied for apprenticeship, I used to live in Nerima  and plan on moving back there." He hoped that that explanation  would prove enough here. Even if it was a bad reputation, most people  understood and accepted the explanation that one was a resident of  Japan's second most crazy city. He didn't want to go into detail  about his life, nor his reason for being so far from home.</p><p>"Sure,  I can help ya, my name's Ichiro Kino, but everybody calls me Tou. I'm  one of the guys to talk to about gettin' set up as an apprentice. You  got any problems with workin' long hours in the sun?" He asked,  his opinion of the young man's stature starting to show.</p><p>"I'm  Ranma, and no, it can't be anywhere near as hard as some of the stuff  I've done in the past." He said, thinking all the while, yeah,  like pulling chestnuts out of a fire quickly enough to avoid being  burnt, crashing through buildings via punch propulsion, or shooting  ki blasts would count as hard compared to learning to build things.</p><p>'Tou'  nodded a moment while pursing his lips before stopping suddenly and  smiling, "Alright kid, show up out back at 6am tomorrow."  He spoke, deep baritone voice holding a slight chuckle in its tone.  "Alright, see ya than." Ranma headed off, grinning.</p><p>"Alright,  let's see, I should get something to eat, and... oof." He'd  bumped into a young woman, who similarly was lost in thought, to the  point of not watching the sidewalk ahead.</p><p>"Oh, hey, watch where  you're going!" The young woman screamed, looking up at the form  of Ranma, and very suddenly began began appraising him, as a fighter  might. Ranma, keeping his cool as best he could in light of the  situation calmly reached a hand out to the young woman, who he noted  had short brown hair that gave her a tomboyish look, oddly, she wore  a blue and white school fuku, her brown eyes showed innocence that  belied her experience which was easily read in her aura. Her arms  fell to the sides loosely and at the ready, hands in half fists that  were covered by orange knuckle-studded gloves which suited her, and a  pair of orange high top sneakers. She accepted his proffered arm and  was quickly on her feet.</p><p>"Sorry about that, guess I was too  hungry to notice where I was going. Say, how about I buy you lunch as  an apology." He knew that he'd been in the wrong, or at least  thought he was, and so he wanted to make amends. With some luck,  getting a friend out of the deal couldn't hurt things.</p><p>"I'm  Ranma by the way." He said with a slight smile, gesturing to the  cafe a few yards away, the place in fact, that he was headed.</p><p>Sakura's  anger was quickly derailed, she could feel his aura and wanted a good  fight, and to do that, she'd need to eat, as she hadn't eaten in a  while. Looking for her sempai was tiresome, and hungry work, she'd  take the time to get a quick meal, not like she had anywhere to be.</p><p>"Sure, I have time for that. I have to get back to finding this  guy I know afterward though." She blushed slightly as she  thought of exactly who the 'guy' she knew was. "Let's go than."</p><p>They  had been seated and had ordered when the the curious strength to the  girls aura, "You wouldn't happen to be a martial artist, would  you?" He asked tentatively, not wanting to anger her if she was,  reading someones aura might be considered an invasion of privacy. Her  expression to his surprise wasn't an angry one, she instead grew a  large grin on her features.</p><p>"Yeah, I was wondering if you wanted  to have a match. But I was too hungry to fight before I ate."  She blushed and lowered her head sheepishly.</p><p>The  food arrived a moment later and they quickly devoured their meals,  Ranma getting himself alot of ramen and Sakura mimicking his order.  In short order they had demolished the titanic supply of food. Ranma  paid the bill with a wallet that looked to have seen better days.</p><p>"So, you wanna have that match now?</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>That  led them here, to a vacant lot on the edge of the city, the area  surrounded in debris from a destroyed building, the chunks of  construction material strewn about, but perhaps by serendipity an  area of 20 meters was left level and uncracked, the foundation of the  building maintained for future use, and strangely clear of all but a  thin layer of dust. Sakura and Ranma now stood near face to face,  right arms crossing at the wrist. The fierce determination in the  pair of eyes was strangely similar, and one could swear they were  siblings. A single pebble rolled down the large mound of rubble.<p>"Yahh!"  Sakura dashed in at the unspoken signal and delivered an opening  straight, low kick, spinning ax combo. Her opponent was fast, and  ducked around her strikes easily, letting her know she'd need to up  the ante before she'd see his real strength. She continued her  assault, missing narrowly, and on the occasion she did connect, he'd  block and counter her moves with a throw. She'd started to pick up  speed and with it the strength her momentum based style could  produce, her blows flowed evenly and with strength at times blurring  together as the misses were redirected into kicks of extreme  strength.</p><p>With every miss or blocked blow she'd increase strength,  and soon she glowed with the supernatural blue light that her inner  energies created as they swirled around her fists and feet. The  momentum base become a background to the rapid barrage of punches and  kicks of all variety. Finally, she decided to hold nothing back, and  began unleashing a fatal series of ki attacks, short range blasts  swirling to life only to be lobbed without care at her opponent.</p><p>Throughout  the match Ranma couldn't help but marvel at how her fighting style  was unlike any other he'd come accross, she appeared to have taught  herself everything, every move was designed to flow evenly into  another to create and endless torrent of fists and feet. She reminded  him of himself, a few years ago, and how very impulsively he fought,  each of her moves was a make or break attack. Everything she had she  poured forth at him, this was her entire spirit. She fought like he  had once done, without a care for anything other than the battle she  was in. He wished he could still fight as she did, but with the  overeager demons he kept within him, he could not risk the excitement  of battle, lest he lose control.</p><p>Thunderous  damage echoed out into the fading light around, he and his opponent  devastating their surroundings. "This is fun, but now it's time  to end it." They had remained on even levels the entire fight,  with Sakura elevating her power and prompting Ranma to do the same,  but now, with a short burst of power he had rushed in laying into the  younger girl with a savagery that seemed to be cruel. His grin that  matched her own the only detail saving this from being a murderous  act. Sakura's face contorted momentarily in pained concentration as  she fought the darkness that had encroached her vision, but with her  strength fading, she lost conciousness.</p><p>Ranma looked up to the sky  he'd exhausted a great deal of energy and realized with a bit of awe  at the girl, this fight had lasted somewhere near two or three hours,  she was strong. The pigtailed fighter followed the shorthaired girl  to the land of dreams shortly after, his endurance having been taxed  to poverty through their long going match.</p><p>Birds...  she could hear birds, but, but why would birds be in her room, and  right next to her no less. Curiosity aching to be sated she cracked  an eye, immediately recanting that decision as daylight thrust into  her retina. She winced as the soreness from what she recalled as a  sparring match between her and that guy, Ranma. Her eyes widened,  despite the slight pain of sun in her eyes, "What?" Her  thought interupted as she noticed to her displeasure that she was  laying on concrete. "What's going on?" She wondered aloud,  and to even greater surprise, she received an answer.</p><p>"I won."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  had woke almost an hour and a half ago, and had guaged the sun or  rather the lack thereof, realizing that he had a couple of hours  until he was to be at the union house. He'd gone about making sure  that all of his stuff was still there and checking the girls  injuries, making sure that his excitement during their match hadn't  broken anything. He'd found the obvious bruising, and in some places  thin red slices, like she had been clawed by a cat. This worried him,  as he couldn't remember exactly those last few moments. That bothered  him, when he had gotten tired he felt himself shift, it was like  watching reality change before his eyes. Of what he remembered was  something supressing him, pushing his thoughts down.<p>"I ain't  bein' anyone but me." He recited his promise to himself and sat  beginning his meditation. The power he felt coursing through him was  still being partially governed by the being that claimed to be who he  was in another life. He dove deep into his own mind, pushing past the  natural barrier, and into his very soul. He concentrated hard and  found what he was looking for. The familiar energy pattern of the  other man in himself, the one he assumed pushed through partially in  battle. "Reiko, show yourself!" He announced angrily.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Reiko  Metsuretsu awoke from the pseudo sleep that he had while trapped half  alive by fate, though he hated to call it that. It wasn't fate was  it? It couldn't have been, fate doesn't involve what you want. This  was something much crueler, he hadn't had the power to finish what he  had started, and so, the temporary solution was obvious. He had  needed to die to seal away that darkness, and die he had, in a  spectacular battle that shook the world, one that had seen an entire  island sunk beneath the waves. But now that time had passed and it  was up to this youth to finish what he could not. His thoughts were  interupted as the voice of his successor to his strength rang clearly  throughout the sort of dreamscape he inhabited.<p>"You  called for me?" He responded curtly, his voice oddly hollow, as  if something were bothering him, but what could bother he, a dead  man, Ranma would wonder.</p><p>"What the hell was it that you did to  me? Why did I start to lose control during that fight?" Ranma  pleaded for the answer, even though his voice held nothing but  outrage. He could feel his own insecurities about losing control as  he had before, during the sparring match with master Sho. He cringed  at the thought, and depression leaked into his aura, visible as day  to this grandmaster. Reiko shared his pain in the fact that it was a  part of his soul that had struck out at the blind master.</p><p>"That  Ranma was the manifestation of the Neko Ken, within our soul, I fear  that with my becoming aware here, so too has that beast. The  supressing effect of the bracers is holding it mostly at bay, but I  fear that the demon that fuels that dreaded technique will continue  to grow in strength if we do not find some way to exercise it. For  now you must continue to grow stronger, and gain mastery over your  strength, or we will be consumed by ourselves. I am truly sorry, and  can only hope that in time I will fade, and leave your mind, ending  my current existence, and return to you yourself."</p><p>Reiko  turned around within the dreamscape and left Ranma to his thoughts,  but as soon as the man was gone he could hear the voice of Sakura,  her scream was enough to pull him back. The tunnel like effect of a  man rushing to retake the helm of his body was odd, but Ranma was far  from unused to the feeling.</p><p>He  reached the world around him just in time to make out a question from  the brown haired girl's lips. "What's going on?" She mused  quietly now, and apparently did not expect an answer, as upon hearing  the grinning reply.</p><p>"I won." She jumped, her entire body  heaving itself backward, than upward, backward roll handspring. She  landed in a defensive stance and began charging her energies, though  she released the buildup upon seeing a smiling pigtailed man.</p><p>"Ranma?" She asked, hoping to god that a challenge such as  he would not be a dream, that she hadn't had the horrible luck to  have imagined this all. Upon his nod her wary look turned to a broad  smile.</p><p>"Will you teach me?" She asked him bluntly, causing  him to narrowly avoid kissing the concrete.</p><p>"Um,  while I would normally, right now I have matters that take  precedence. Now, you could train with me while I'm here in Kyoto, but  I simply don't have the time necessary to train you properly."  He responded with a 'we regret to inform you' tone in his voice,  remaining clinical, despite the growing fear within him that the  NekoKen, a technique, no, a torture visited on him by his father,  would indeed consume him, his dreams of the pit had returned, and now  he had only one choice, gain mastery, or death. Nothing else was an  option to him now, he could only do those two things. His refusal to  be a danger to innocents was too great, he wouldn't want to  accidentally hurt someone he loved because he lost control of that  demon. He returned again from his introspection to see Sakura looking  at him with a slight frown, which transformed into a smile quickly.  "I suppose that's okay."</p><p>Ranma  reached the union with just a few minutes to spare, he and Sakura  parting ways after a quick breakfast. "Tou? You here?" He  asked as he moved into the back area of the building, as he had been  instructed the previous day.</p><p>"Hello?" He called out through  what, to him, appeared to be a completely deserted building. He was  surprised a moment later when the giant frame of Tou appeared in the  doorway.</p><p>"You were early, eh? Well, put these on and meet me  outside." He casually tossed the young man a toolbelt,  coveralls, and a hardhat.</p><p>"You'll need that. Oh, and here."  He walked the few feet between them, handing the young a book.</p><p>"These  are the basic measurements and whatnot, mostly stuff you learned in  school, but skim through that, make sure ya got everything down."  The much larger man turned and left than, heading off down into the  practical application area of the instruction area.</p><p>It  was these times, when Ranma sat alone in study, or in preparation of  something that would later have a great deal of effect on his future,  that he reflected upon his life. He could remember the loneliness of  his training trips, and somehow, each time he sat in solitude, these  memories would return to haunt him, leaving him feeling hopeless, but  lately, they hadn't, they could only enforce his decision to leave  that worthless and pitiful existence.</p><p>Nabiki  was right, thank god I actually listened, too bad she had to  blackmail me to do it. He smiled at that thought, instead of the  expression most would have when thinking of blackmail. He'd learned  some time ago that everything Nabiki had ever done had been to  support her family, and from what he could tell, eventually that took  to mean him as well. He'd become a decently shrewd businessman when  it was needed, and as the saying goes, 'forewarned is forearmed.' He  browsed quickly through the book, picking up a few things he'd need,  such as the names and uses for the tools that he saw in his belt, and  the uses of the different types of lumber, and other building  materials he'd need. He noticed that most of these things were  simple, but that he'd need to memorize the portion of the book that  listed the building codes for the country, those where bound to have  some importance.</p><p>Half  hour later the pigtailed young man entered the construction zone,  where the journeymen would teach their apprentices the different  things they'd need to become licensed contractors. Throughout the two  and a half hours he spent in the 'class' he'd kept his attention  sharply focused on Tou, the large man showing him the way to do  things, and after a couple demonstrations expecting him to be able to  repeat it. The first few times he'd failed to even grasp the simplest  concept, measuring and marking. A few months later though, the same  young man was spot marking, a talent that had taken Tou many years to  perfect.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Intermission</i><p>These  classes lasted for nearly two months before something happened,  during the time Ranma had grown closer to Sakura, finally glad to  meet another person who didn't look at him as a trophy, a commodity  to be passed around. Before they knew it, the Street Fighter  tournament had crossed into Japan again, and as it did news of  something terrible came to the young warriors.</p><p><i>End  Intermission</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>"B-bison?"  Sakura stuttered as the chinese woman and she circled one another,  both with tired expressions.</p><p>"Yes he's coming here, it seems  that he survived, like the roach he is." She stated, several  kicks launched from the elder woman, striking at first a solid block  which flashed blue as a small aura flare stabbed into the older  woman's leg, but further met nothing but air nothing but air, as  Sakura leapt over the blows, right leg searching for the top of her  adversaries head. Her foot found purpose momentarily as she used the  woman in blue's head as a spring board of sorts, launching herself  further into the air.</p><p>"Shinku Hadoken!" She screamed,  loosing the quickly gathered energy burst. It flared out from her  palms and caught her opponent by surprise at the speed which she had  gathered the large attack, and catching her off guard enough for her  to lose the match. Chun-Li sank into unconsciousness seconds after  the blast subsided. Sakura landed and assumed a victory pose, before  she herself fell into the abyss of unconscious, exhausted from her  match with the more experienced fighter.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hours  later both world warriors rose from a resting place that was much too  soft for the ground both knew they had lapsed into the dark on.<p>"Wha,  where am I?" The two women spoke in unisen, each taking a moment  to account for themselves, and each finding that they were well  bandaged and only suffering from a lack of energy. They were tired,  and thus needed food to replenish their energy stores. Sakura lifted  her head to look around the room, and saw that it was nought but an  empty room with a pair of futons and a pack in the corner, a sword  resting against both pack and wall. She heard what sounded to be a  guitar coming from outside, slowly, as the snails pace she moved at  was the most she could manage she wandered toward the window, to look  outside. She saw nothing, but now knew that the sound was coming from  up, as she turned her head roofward she noted the familiar stiff boot  hanging from the roof's overhang.</p><p>"Ranma?" She called  weakly, her breathing coming in gasps. She berated herself for being  so weak, but right now, she couldn't think about that, because, she  realized all too quickly that she'd leaned out too far. Her normal  supernatural strength was gone, replaced by the frail frame of an  exhausted teenage girl. She couldn't even scream, she knew she'd not  last long afterthis incorrect fall, and without hjer usual reserves  she didn't have enough to stregthen herself enough to endure. But  suddenly she felt the security of Ranma's arms holding her,  dispelling the tightness of her chest.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The  pigtailed man had found Sakura and Chun-Li unconscious in what had  become his and her training grounds, where they sparred with one  another, and where Ranma would meditate, and gain greater control by  wrapping himself in his aura, practicing the techniques that he had  the basics for.<p>"What the hell's with you and fighting anyway?"  He had asked the unconscious girl, even as he'd lifted her and her  chinese companion. He'd checked their injuries and bandaged them,  laying them down on his futon and spare bedroll. The pigtailed  martial artist grabbed his guitar from the case beside his pack, and  climbed out the window, swiftly leaping to the roof. He started  playing the six-string and humming to himself as time went on, he  felt the time pass, and watched as the sun crossed the sky and sunk  beneath the horizon.</p><p>His hyper-senses felt Sakura and Chun-Li wake,  but only Sakura moved she stumbled to the window, as he would've, if  he'd woken up in an usual place and weak as... a mouse, definitely  not a kitten. (ripped from somewhere, not sure where, it just sounds  too good to pass up) When he looked down to see her falling he  abandoned the song, which most would recognize as Green Day's "Time  of Your Life." He swung around to the underside of the overhang,  pushing off and using his ki to increase his weight dramatically.  Even swifter still he caught up with her, but only as he was flipping  over to land. He landed and immediately crouched, cushioning the  fall.</p><p>"You ok, Sakura?" He asked, the concern written in  bold marker accross his face. The younger girl nodded, and could not  maintain her strength any longer, and embraced the darkness of sleep.</p><p>When  Ranma returned to the room he'd laid her and the other woman in, he  noticed that she was now sitting up, looking very distressed. "What's  wrong?" He asked with genuine concern in his tone and across his face.</p><p>"I'm Ranma by the way, brought you and  Sakura here inside when I went to the demo zone for some training and  saw you two knocked out." He said, laying Sakura back into his  futon, and reaching over his back to grab his guitar, which was set  into its case seconds later.</p><p>Chun-Li  had tiredly witnessed her fellow street-fighter's plummet out the  window, she hadn't known if there was a long drop from the thing, but  when the younger girl fell out, she felt her heart jump up into her  throat, worry overwhelming the Chinese woman.</p><p>"Sakura!" She  gasped, and then again gasping out a barely breathed. "What  the?" As she saw a blur drop accross the moonlit sill. She heard  the scream end and feared the worst but realized only moments later  that she hadn't heard the meaty thud that usually accompanies a hard  fall. She was confused for the few moments, and wanted dearly to rise  to aid her friend, but her aching muscles wouldn't respond, and the  lifelessness in her legs was a further blow. Have I been paralyzed?  What's going on with my legs? She continued to think, and watched  through the window unblinkingly, until the door opened, and she felt  the power flowing off him, a man of about six foot, shadowed by the  halo of the silver moonlight. His face was undiscernable with the way  the shadows cast about him, but the tender way he carried Sakura's  prone form convinced her of her safety. As he lay her down he turn to  her.</p><p>"What's wrong?" She blushed as she noticed that she  had been staring at him. He went on to explain where she was, and  near the end she had figured out what to say, she realized that after  having underestimated Sakura, she'd not be in shape to fight Bison,  especially if her legs truly were paralyzed.</p><p>"Wh-what's wrong  with my legs?" She asked in a near panic. She near immediately  was relieved at his response. "Oh, that? Your leg was broken, so  I paralyzed them so you wouldn't turn in your sleep and aggravate it.  Sorry if I scared ya, thought I'd take you to a hospital or something  after you woke up. It'd be kinda hard to explain that you two were  unconscious after a street fight. You are one of those Street  Fighters that Sakura was talking about, right?"</p><p>"Oh,  yes, yes I am. My name is Chun-Li by the way. Wait, broken leg? Oh,  oh god no. Bison, he, he's coming and there's no one left, Ryu..."  She faded off, silent sobs at what she imagined may happen to her,  fear that the insane drug-lord, and powermad general (I never knew  what was up with Bison's military-esque outfit was about.) might have  in store for the currently incapacitated world warriors, or what  might happen to him. Another racking bout of sobs escaped her,  causing Ranma to stop off in his motions for a chair. He moved  cautiously toward the the weeping woman, kneeling to sit at her  level.</p><p>"Who's Bison? What's he gonna do here? And what would he  want with you?" He asked concernedly, only adding. "And  what's wrong with this Ryu guy?" Chun-Li spilled her heart, the  weight of the upcoming troubles weighing greatly on her. She cried  and spoke for nearly the entire night before falling into a fitful  slumber.</p><p>Ranma  walked to the edge of the room and gathered up his guitar, and MP3  player and jumping to the roof. He lost himself in his music playing  tirelessly for hours, only deciding finally what he would do as the  dawn broke over the horizon. This Bison, he was apparently a madman  without regard for human life. A monster who preyed on those who  rotted their bodies to arm his criminal soldiers.</p><p>"Bison has to  go, but how can I do it, if he can control a fighter of this Ryu  guy's caliber?" He wondered to himself as he prepared himself  mentally for his upcoming trial. I suppose this is one of those  Saffron moments, where I must hold nothing back, and attack  relentlessly, aiming to destroy my opponent. The strange thought  seemed to come to easily, and in an eerily familiar purring tone. The  Neko-ken. That primal possession, the tireless clawing at his   would recognize it even if his rational mind refused to  believe what it was being told.</p><p>His  internal reverie ended when the light caught him in the eye,  awakening him in a sorts from his thoughts.</p><p>"I suppose that in  the end, this is the result of my actions, and that my greatest test  of control will come soon. He smiled sourly to himself, gathering his  things before dropping into the window. I'll plan later, I need sleep  now, bad. he decided as he set his guitar into the case, and leaned  against the wall, falling into sleep soon after.</p><p>TBC...</p><p>A/N:  This was a great deal shorter than I had expected from the amount of  time I worked on it. Recently life has been hectic, as I've taken on  an A Certification Course with all my other studies. I have chapter 8  written but no track for it selected. This is probably a bit weaker  than my usual. But ultimately you'll all be glad for the slow  buildup, I promise. My editor, Paul is currently in the process of  writing his own original work, and I wish him the best of luck.  Thought I don't recall introducing any techniques in this chapter  I'll throw down the translations for any that have been used.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Technique  Translations :</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Shinku  Hadoken:</b> I have been informed that my translation of Shinku  Hadoken was erroneous I wish to thank the reviewer "kyuketsukiouji"  for correcting me. It is my intention to present as accurate a  translation as I can for all techniques and names I list. The actual  meaning of it as kyu, as I am sure must be a Street Fighter buff,  states it is "True Emptiness Wave Path Fist" Thank you again.</p><p style="text-align:center;">X  signing off...</p><p>End  Transmission</p>
