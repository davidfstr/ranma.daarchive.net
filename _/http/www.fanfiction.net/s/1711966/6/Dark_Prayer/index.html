</div><p>The  darkness that surrounded him evaporated, his double fading into mist,  leaving him with the knowledge, vast knowledge of powers greater than  he ever thought possible. It was when the pain began. His head  started to hurt, and his body trembled beyond his control. He fell  to his knees, crying out from the pain.</p><p>The  power he had now was scary to him, the sheer amount of ki he could  focus at one time, it was mind-blowing. His emotions swirled, his  power threatened to pour fourth, against everyone. He struggled  against the bonds, changing his own energy to match what his past  self had been. He cried out in pain. Power like this should not  have been allowed.</p><p>He  fell to his knees clutching his sides in pain. Energy swirled around  him, in tiny arches of lightning.</p><p>"MAKE  IT STOP," he screamed into the abyss…</p><p>A  startled gasp of air, a scream into the waking world, brought him  into the circle of women watching over him. His eyes cleared and  revealed four very beautiful women holding him, fussing over him, and  worrying for him. He laid back into his mother's lap, unable to  find the strength to do much else. His body was torn, not  physically, but spiritually, from the power of his past self. He had  no way of controlling it, no way of making sure that he did not die  in the process of summoning it.</p><p><b>Dark  Prayer</b></p><p>By:  X-Zero and Paul</p><p>Disclaimer:  I don't own Ranma ½. Don't sue, I'm broke.</p><p><b>Chapter  6 – Don't Stay</b></p><p>Nodoka  cried, feeling her son's heartbeat return to normal. Her son's  power was clearly visible during his blackout, and it frightened her.   She knew in her heart that he wouldn't hurt her, but it was  frightening to be in the presence of such power. She cried silent  prayers to any god who would listen, she prayed for her son's  health, and well being. Until she felt him stir, she wasn't sure if  he'd ever awake, already it had been an hour since the combat, and  some of the others were rising now.</p><p>Ryouga,  he had left, bowing his head as he acknowledged his defeat. Ukyo had  woken up a few minutes ago, confused, wondering why she wasn't  brutalized like the others. Shampoo had been taken by the awakened  Mousse along with the still unconscious elder, back to their place.  Taro was still in his coma, but the hospital guaranteed that he would  be alright eventually.</p><p>But  through all of this, the warrior remained out cold. Ranko seemed  unconcerned by his condition. She had heard a bit of the story from  Ranko of her son and his power, but it was too much to believe. The  reincarnate of a warrior that gave gods reason to tremble, it was  almost too much to believe.</p><p>Like  a Phoenix from the grave, his eyes opened. She could see the fire  burning there, but there was a mix of emotion. The warrior was not  the same anymore.</p><p>The  Tendo sisters and their guest, Ranko, smiled warmly at the prone form  of Ranma. Nabiki looked at him with an apologetic smile that was warm  with the need for a friend, Kasumi with a genuine smile, not the one  that she gave to everyone, this one was meant for her little brother.  Ranko, the last of them, she smiled at him with genuine love, a  warmness, and kindness that he had long ago given up on ever seeing.  He could not find the strength to return their smiles so he laid  there.</p><p>"I...I  need to stand." He said hesitantly, knowing well that these  women would be reluctant to allow him to rise. He could barely sit  up a few minutes before, but he found his body finding its center  once again. He slowly pushed up and looked around.</p><p>"How  long has it been?" He asked, looking around, the only still  forms remaining around this place were that of the dumbass duo, the  old freak, and the brat. Those nicknames brought a lump of disgust  into his throat, though that was quickly settled by spitting at them.</p><p>The  redhead was the first to respond, "It's been about an hour,  maybe a little more." She spoke quietly, her whispered tones  ringing clearly in his ears. "Re... Ranma, I know that I should  have been more forward…"</p><p>"I  wasn't ready," Ranma assured her, raising his hand. "I thank  you for being there though."</p><p>"You  know some of it then?" She asked in confusion. This was moving  faster than even she expected.</p><p>"Reiko  came for a chat," he smiled weakly. The pain was an all too fresh  memory for his mind and spirit. "I think I am in trouble."</p><p>"Your  power is not ready," Ranko look at him gravely. She remembered  Reiko's strength, the awesome power that consumed both him and the  darkness twenty years before. It was enough to make her shudder,  especially if Ranma could not control it.</p><p>"I  think Reiko said he placed the blocks back," he shook his head.  "His power was insane."</p><p>"It  was meant for a different time," Ranko lamented. "Reiko's  power was like nothing even the Gods had thought up."</p><p>"It's  nice to know that I have a ways to go," Ranma tried to lighten the  mood, but everyone looked down.</p><p>Ranko  looked at him seriously for the first time since they met. "You  need to leave, before it consumes you and everyone around you."</p><p>Nodoka  looked at the woman in shock. "You don't mean…"</p><p>"Reiko  told me this would happen," Ranko said softly, nodding her head and  hefting the Katana that belonged to the fallen warrior.</p><p>"But I  hoped that it would not be so painful when he fully awoke. I had  hoped you would be able to stay with those you loved and whom loved  you…but…" she stopped, holding back tears, remembering the  years of long separation from Reiko.</p><p>"It's  not something that could have happened," Ranma said, holding her by  the shoulders. She swore in her mind, she heard the strength and  control of Reiko there.</p><p>"The power that I posses will either  consume me or be mastered by me, and it's not a struggle that  others can be present for. It's one I must master on my own."</p><p>She  hugged him lightly, remembering that Ranma was not the same as Reiko.   Affection made the new warrior very uncomfortable.</p><p>His  mother stepped forward, tears in her eyes. "Do you have too?"</p><p>"No  choice," he shrugged, giving her a light hug. He forgave his  mothers mistakes, as he hoped she forgave his, but there was still  uneasiness there. He didn't really know how to be family with  anyone…he was so used to being alone.</p><p>"Choices  are rarely given to those with great power," Ranko offered the  older woman. "Reiko would tell me that all the time."</p><p>"Who  is Reiko," Nabiki asked, finding her voice again after so long.</p><p>"He  is," Ranko shrugged, jerking a thumb towards Ranma. "Or at  least, he was. I can't tell you the whole story until he  remembers."</p><p>Everyone  accepted that without question, it fit with the strange life that  they tended to lead.</p><p>"Are  your bracers bothering you Ranma," she asked, looking at the  lightly glowing blue bracers.</p><p>"Nah,"  he looked at them, and then looked towards the Katana. "Mind if I  see that though?"</p><p>Ranko  looked at the ancient weapon, startled by the fact that she had not  given it to him sooner. She handed him the weapon, when the hilt  began to glow brightly.</p><p>"What  the hell?" Ranma watched as tendrils of light reached from the  bracers to the swords. He looked again, he swore she had handed him  only one sword.</p><p>Ranko  laughed lightly. "Reiko never told me the secret to those swords.  In his hands they were two blades of exquisite beauty and power. In  another's hands it looked like a useless antique."</p><p>Ranma  smiled slightly. Twirling the swords, he slipped them together, and  marveled as they reformed into one blade. He placed it at his side  and looked at Ranko. "Not too bad am I?"</p><p>"Not  at all," she smiled sadly. "I hope you find what you are looking  for."</p><p>"So  do I," Ranma hugged her and wished the others goodbye. He turned  and began walking towards the doors of the Tendo compound, when  Happosai squatted before him.</p><p>"I  was wondering when you would wake up, Reiko," he said with a slight  bow. "I have missed you old friend."</p><p>"Not  Reiko yet, old freak," Ranma smirked, but returned the bow of  respect. "I take it you knew my past self."</p><p>"Yes,"  he nodded.</p><p>"Your past self was a great warrior, but also a greater  friend. I should have seen it long ago, when you turned out so much  greater than that louse Genma should have been able to produce."</p><p>"It's  alright," Ranma said with a smile. "I still have a long way to  go before I am back to the man that you knew. If I can ever reach  that level of strength at all."</p><p>"You  will," Happosai smiled at him, and reached into his tunic. "This  is for you, Ranma. Use it well."</p><p>He  handed him a small amulet. It had the Yin-Yang symbol on it, with a  strange character carved into the center.</p><p>"You  will know what it means when you are ready," Happosai watched as he  walked in.</p><p>Just  give me myself back and</p><p>"I'm  leaving tonight." He said as he observed the 3 o'clock sun.  Thoughts somewhat in order the young man moved through the ruins of  the house, looking for his pack, the heavy material hopefully having  survived this destruction. There, he found it along with a heavy  looking lock box, undoubtedly full of Nabiki's things. He hefted the  two heavy packs, his and the old man's, as well as the box. He set  the box down before Nabiki, before digging through the packs,  consolidating the contents into his single one. Taking only what he  needed, and dumping the rest into the other for sale.</p><p>"That  makes sense." He states simply as the hidden pocket of his  father's pack is found, gems and precious metals from the many ruins,  temples, and monasteries they had visited spilling into the main  pack.</p><p>"None of these are from the one's that had any people, that's  for sure." He thought aloud to himself, noting the flawless  nature of the precious materials.</p><p>"I'll keep 'em though."  Once again to himself as he finishes. He stood and looked around,  noting that Akane was rising, their fathers doing the same slowly.</p><p>Akane  couldn't believe this, here she was, the best martial artist around  (A/N: She isn't too bright ok?) and that perverted jerk had gone and  cheated, using his dirty tricks to catch her when she wasn't ready.  Her groan and pained form agreed that she indeed wasn't ready. Her  mind could barely cope with the icy feeling she had, cold as if there  had been snow the previous night. That was when it hit her, she  couldn't feel her pillows, blanket, or even... no she was still  wearing enough of her sweat suit preserve her modesty.</p><p>She groaned at  looked over to the noise she heard. Her father and uncle Saotome,  they were hurt, more noise. Her head snapped over to where she saw  Ranma messing with his pack, Aunty and her sisters watching him, and  not helping her. That's when she saw that girl, that one that had  snuck up on her a while ago. Her eyes narrowed, Yeah, it is her.  that was the slut who interfered in her fight and snuck up behind  her. She wouldn't stand a chance now that Akane was ready for her.  (Skewed and nearly retarded that girl is.)She boiled with rage,  allowing her anger to effortlessly override both her protesting  muscles and her common sense, pathetic as it was. She rose, glaring  daggers into the petite redhead.</p><p>"You!  YOU BITCH!" She screamed, knowing in her heart that this whore  was the cause for Ranma's new behavior, but she couldn't have him,  they had given him to her, he was hers, she owned him.</p><p>Ranko  watched the spoiled little brawler awaken, and with a little  detachment watched her charge, her own energy reserves not nearly as  tapped as Ranma's. She had been Reiko's other half, the warrior  who fought with him through the darkest battle that the Earth would  ever know, and this little child thought she was ready for her. She  settled into the combat stance that Reiko taught her, and waited for  the child. She never arrived.</p><p>Ranma  noted the daughter of Soun rushing towards Ranko. His bracers glowed  a bright red, and he appeared before her. His eyes blazed to life,  taking on the same color as his bracers.</p><p>I  don't want to be ignored</p><p>"NO  ONE HARMS RANKO!" He roared, bringing his fist forward. It was  then that it exploded. The pain he felt returned.</p><p>He  blocked her mallet swing, using his other arm to snap the handle of  the semi solid ki construct, lifting her legs from the ground with a  sweep. It did not end there though. He was too enraged to really  think. Moments later he was assaulting her with punch after punch,  kick after kick, each attack slamming into the girl, who to her  merit, was still trying to fight back. Heavy punches shot forward  from her, only to end up clashing against his fist, causing immense  pain. She began to submit beneath the onslaught, her tolerance for  pain not withstanding the pigtailed fighter's brutalization. She once  again found herself pushed past her limits, and into the sweet bliss  of the unaware.</p><p>Ranma  backed away from Akane's bloodied form. His hands…his hands they  were covered in her blood. Just like Reiko and Ranko had warned, he  was not in control of himself, let alone his power. He fell to his  knees, when Ranko appeared at his side, and held her hands over the  girl. Golden energy poured forth from her hands, and slowly healed  the wounds.</p><p>"Hurry  and finish," she said in a commanding tone. "You don't want  anything else to set you off. Your power might do more than you want  to happen."</p><p>He  nodded numbly, when he heard the dual dumbasses, well, sadly, or not,  they weren't intelligent enough to realize that they didn't have a  chance against the prodigy that stood falling apart before them, and  so both charged, but never made it. A brutal snap kick to the Tendo  patriarch's face put him down and sent teeth and blood pouring onto  the rubble. Genma similarly was sent spiraling into the land of  dreams by a front-foot wheel kick to the temple. The rotund and aging  martial artist fell to the ground, unconscious. Before them stood  Happosai, the fighter shrugging as he dragged the two away.</p><p>"Forget  it and just leave now, it'll make things less difficult."</p><p>Ranma  nodded, and tossed his pack onto his shoulder. He paused for just a  moment, only long enough to return the fierce embrace of the women  who had watched over him.</p><p>"I promise I'll send word when I've  stopped somewhere long enough." He was gone than, disappeared.  The last words they would hear of him for years to come floated  gently on the wind. "Sleep Mode."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Two  Months Later</i><p>"Mouretsu  Reikon!" The lance of red energy slammed into the 7 foot demon,  and incinerated it. Ranma went alert as he heard the sound of sirens  in the distance, and swiftly dashed from the scene, knowing that his  letter would still arrive, despite the area of devastation  surrounding the mailbox. Moments after he was gone several heroines  dressed entirely too scandalously would arrive, and be confused even  as reporters snapped photos and reported another victory for them. A  certain green-haired ancient nodded as she watched the pigtailed  warrior leave the ward, headed for the woods. She couldn't help  but shiver at the future she had seen. The one she dreamed of was  hell compared to the one that he would create, if he was allowed to  grow. Her future self had made sure she had sat down and saw the  truth, and the greatness the young boy held. Hopefully he would be  able to find his way. She turned and disappeared from the nearby  rooftop as her friends began to arrive, and look at the devastation  the chaos lord had unleashed on the demon.</p><p>Miles  away an auburn haired woman opened a letter, sitting beside the two  young women she'd come to think of as daughters.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Dear  Mom,<p>Training  has been going well, at least I think. Reiko has not appeared to  talk to me since the time I tried to release his holds on the power.  I think it was the first time I have ever been scared in my life,  even Saffron cannot match an angry Reiko. And I decided to listen,  since he still holds the key to the lion's share of the power that I  was blessed with, or cursed. With Great Power comes Great  Responsibility, the American movie I watched recently said, and I am  beginning to see just how hard it is to hold such power. I've manage  to begin the process though, and I hope Reiko is proud. I cannot let  myself down after all. I'm on my way to a Taoist monastery that  Genma and I passed on our training trip. This place was where I  learned Tai Chi, and hopefully, there I will find some answers. I'm  on my way North now, and hope to contact you again soon.    With Love,</p><p>Ranma</p><p>P.S.  Tell Nabiki and Kasumi that I say hello and that I miss them.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The  brief message lifted Nodoka spirits, but was it to little to late.  Life at the Tendo dojo was far from perfect now. The family was a  mess and her "husband" refused to ease their burden any. Now,  without Ranma's power there, the terrors that seemed to march  through Nerima were unabated. Happosai seemed to have changed  overnight, he kept spouting off some nonsense about the Great one  returning, while Ranko only laughed at his antics. It was a  situation she did not understand, and really did not want to. The  only thing she hoped for was the quick return of her son, before  things flew even farther out of control.<p>The  Tendo dojo was suspiciously quiet, no noises of rage...</p><p>"Damn  that pervert!" Never mind, I was thinking of some other  training hall, this one was shaking visibly from the temper tantrum  of its youngest occupant. Her raging tantrums having run through her  supply of cinderblocks, two by fours, and bricks. Nabiki refused to  buy more, and Soun, for his foolish merit, could do nothing to  convince the girl to the contrary. Kasumi, bless her heart, remained  the calm in the storm, dutifully doing the chores around the house  while Nabiki brought in money, and the others drank, destroyed,  cried, whined, complained, and all around harassed the other two.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>One  Month Later…</i><p>Travel  was not something new to him; in fact he preferred it to the  stationary life he led in Nerima. Traversing forests and huge  grasslands, crossed rural rice paddies, visited several smaller towns  and cities, done minor work during the few short hours that he  stayed, and left again. But now he stood before the gate of the  monastery, perched high on a rocky cliff overlooking the pacific. As  he approached the gate the monks came to greet him, sketching a bow,  which the pigtailed man returned in kind.</p><p>"I have come seeking  Brother Sho; can you show me to him?" Ranma inquired of the man,  hoping perhaps to find the old mentor that had saved him from  insanity.</p><p>"You  seek Sho-sensei? Yes, come with me." He led him through a well  kept courtyard, and beautifully groomed sand garden, they reached the  door and instantly Ranma kicked off the slippers he wore, which  showed signs of wear.</p><p>"Thank you." He bowed again as he  opened the sliding door and entered, taking a seat before the master  teacher. Through all this he made not a sound, but knew that the old  man had long ago sensed his presence, even as he sat patiently  awaiting his mentor's attention.</p><p>Sho  felt a student he had not seen in a long time, and knew that he would  never, 'see' him again. His eyes had gone, but still he was the  master of this place, and the most skilled in their art. He was a  well built man considering his age, and wore the simple grey tunic  and breeches of his brothers. Thick silver-white hair was kept in a  swordsman's ponytail, and framed his face well, blind eyes staring  off into the distance.</p><p>After  what seemed like hours to the young warrior the old man spoke, "You  have returned, as I knew you would. Tell me, why do you believe you  are here?" He asked of the young man knowingly.</p><p>"Don't  know quiet yet," Ranma said sitting next to the monk who tried to  excise one of his demons years ago. He had found lately that those  demons went far deeper than he ever imagined. Even after three  months he was still no closer to control Reiko's awesome power, nor  was he any closer to understanding why he had been reborn at all, or  if he had been reborn.</p><p>He  breathed in and out slowly, looking at the monk, but never meet his  eyes. Sho simply shook his head. "You answer well, for one so  young."</p><p>"As  I understand it, I am not that young," Ranma found a small part of  the floor very interesting. "They tell me I am a reborn soul."</p><p>"That  you are," Sho said with a smile. "Come old friend, let us eat  and we shall see about lifting one demon from you. You will have to  find the rest."</p><p>This  was how the training began, for months to come he would sit in quiet  meditation under the tutelage of the old monk. He would do chores to  keep his body in shape. The days went by quickly after the agonizing  crawl of the first days. Now he sat here, meditating upon the time he  has spent here, and the letter he had written a few days ago, sending  it to his mother, who would read it soon before he left this place.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Dear  Mother,<p>First  and foremost I hope that this letter finds you in good health. I  reached the monastery some year and a half ago, and things have  proceeded well, the brother's here have been kind, courteous, and  closer to family than I have ever known. Master Sho has become the  real father figure that I have been wont for. If things continue in  their current path than I should be leaving this place soon, at least  I hope. Master Sho has fallen ill and so now I merely meditate upon  the scrolls he has instructed me to learn. I still have no idea what  Reiko is, or who he was, no one wants to tell me though they seem to  know. I wish I could understand. I wish I knew why I am here. It  gets harder and harder to breathe with every day. I keep getting the  feeling that the world is closing in on me, and if I am not able to  overcome, soon enough there will be no room to run or to change.  Master Sho has taken to showing me how to breathe, how to find my  center in my breath, rather than my fist. I can only hope that it is  working.…</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>Sho  and Ranma sat upon large rocks within the sand garden breathing  calmly as they meditated, after over an hour Ranma began to get  impatient.</p><p>"Master, when will we begin our practice?" He  asked with an edge in his polite tone. The old man merely gave him an  insufferable smirk and responded.</p><p>"We will begin when you can  remain calm throughout the first exercise." The old man smiled  and continued to sit within the lotus position calmly, breathing  evenly and totally at peace. Ranma tried to follow the elder man's  example and continued to meditate, seeking his center and holding  himself there, calmly embracing the flow of his soul's strength. When  he was broken from his trance by Sho's words he was surprised.</p><p>"Huh,  what did you say?" He responded intelligently.</p><p>"I said  young one, that our exercises are complete for today." The Tao  master stood for a moment and stretched to work away the stiffness he  felt from sitting for so long.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Ranma  asked, ignoring the blatantly obvious answer. "Look at the sky."  The man supplied, it was dark, the light of the sun replaced with the  light of the torches lining the monastery walls. The pigtailed  warrior felt dumbfounded, he had been sitting here for hours,  completely oblivious to the goings on of the things around him.</p><p>"H-how? Master Sho, how can it be so late already?" He  asked, muttering to himself as they went into the main dining hall.</p><p>"Just as the reed bends to the winds, so too does the completely  focused mind bend without notice." He responded in his rasping  voice, leaving the young man to gape like a fish in wonderment.</p><p><i>End  Flashback</i></p><p>After  that day things went back to normal, that training exercise having  turned into one of our normal routines. We'd sit in meditation for  the later part of the day, returning to the dining hall to eat after  the sun had set. The earlier parts of the day were devoted to chores  though, and believe me, they are much different chores than one would  imagine. The chores are nothing incredibly strenuous, mind you. In  fact, I have had a chance to learn the Bakusai Tenketsu due to it,  which turned out for the best. The cliff that the temple rests at the  foot of was crumbling a bit, and one day during chores something  happened.</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>Ranma  was repairing things on the roof when he heard the rumbling noise,  and when he looked up he saw the tons stone heading toward him,  tumbling down the steep cliff face. For a fraction of an instant,  Ranma's mind locked up, natural reaction taking prevalence, but just  as quickly as that neuron made its connection another fired,  reminding him of his intense martial skill. His senses returned he  leapt to meet the first boulder as it came; he lighted upon the large  rock for merely an instant, jamming his finger into the thing and  leaping away, only to land on another of the falling stones as the  first exploded in a hail of pebbles and shrapnel. This process  repeated several times, until the roof of his new home was littered  entirely with small rocks. Strangely though, this was what he was  doing, he was setting gravel into the freshly tarred roof. He applied  his energy carefully and as he landed atop the monastery he suffused  the entire roof of the building with a brilliant cerulean glow,  melting further the tar, and feeling the rocks sink into the ebon  stickiness. With a thought he reversed his technique, cooling his  aura to near freezing slowly, cooling the freshly done job.</p><p>He  touched ground and came face to face with one of the elder monks, who  noted that he carried with him the large sacks that contained the  gravel.</p><p>"What happened brother Ranma?" Ranma continued on  his way, responding seriously as he went.</p><p>"Rock slide, nothing  serious." With that he was gone, leaving a Taoist monk to do a  rather convincing fish-out-of-water impression.</p><p><i>End  Flashback</i></p><p>The  rest of my time has been spent studying myself, introspection such as  what caused me to do what I did, who am I? These profound questions  that people have pondered for thousands of years are the ones I now  have to answer, and find these answers quickly. I have come to one  conclusion, however, strange that an American cartoon makes all too  clear. Strangely enough I made this discovery while I was in my girl  form, master Sho having insisted that I spend half of my time as a  girl to better acclimate myself to centering the female body that I  sometimes inhabit.</p><p>'I  am who I am, and that's all that I am'</p><p>Now  in this I mean that no matter the complicated answers that those who  don't really know the answer to the questions I spent wondering  about, there is only one answer for the question, 'Who am I?' and  that is, 'I'm me and no one else.' I have truly learned many things  in my stay here, and as of today, I am leaving this place. Master Sho  is to be cremated just before I leave, my hope is that he has the  peace now in death that he had in life. He has helped me greatly to  achieve a sense of peace, for which I will forever be thankful.  Master Sho has told me of other places where I may be able to achieve  more learning. He feels that I should take time away from martial  arts to learn a craft of some kind, that I might better function in  the modern world. So, I end this letter as I did the one before. Oh,  and do tell Nabiki and Kasumi how I have been, which if it was not  previously mentioned, I am well. I love you all very much, and cannot  wait for the day that I return, as it is, right now I would be  nothing more than a burden, and that is something I cannot bear to be  any longer.</p><p>Love Always,</p><p>Ranma"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>As  the auburn haired woman read this latest message from her son aloud  to the younger women, she couldn't help but smile at seeing the looks  on their faces, the precious looks of longing plain as day on angelic  features. She too wished her son would hurry and return, but she knew  in her heart, where felt it mattered most, that he would return to  make her proud. He had already done so, by remaining himself despite  the things around him, by not losing his sanity in a maddening hell  of his father's construction, and by not giving in to the 'manly'  urges he felt to women he cared nothing for aside from fleeting  friendship. Beautiful women who would have no trouble seducing any  man they desired, her sons show of discipline and self control was  astounding, now if only he'd actually find someone to settle down  with and have children. She derailed the train of thought and  returned to her chores, ushering Nabiki and Kasumi off to class.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Master  Sho Iruhara is dead, and now, he is to be buried, his last student  wishes to be the one to fulfill the old man's wish to be cremated in  the fires of spirit, and we feel that no other, none but this last  protégé, should be given that honor, if any among us  disagree, speak now." Spoke Brother Shen, after a few minutes  of silence, he continued.<p>"Come brothers, we go to the cliff  side." They all strode solemnly to the cliff overlooking the  sea, finding Ranma, sitting on the edge, floating with his aura  maintaining a cushion below him.</p><p>"It is time Brother Ranma."  The pigtailed man rose, his grey tunic and pants fluttering with his  self made wind.</p><p>"Farewell, master." His aura rose around  him like a bonfire, peaking several meters in the air.</p><p>"This is  the day of endings and new beginnings, let that the kami gift this  soul with passage into the realm of the ancestors, and that his  enlightened spirit be at peace. Fukyuu Eiyuu!" The stream of  silver fire overtook the funeral pyre, burning it away quickly,  leaving behind only the shallow collection tray and the ashes of a  great man.</p><p>"Return  to the realm of eternity, and rest in peace." His voice was soon  echoed by the voices of several of those around him. He shed a single  tear into the wind, the crystalline droplet finding its way into the  tray before him. Even as he went solemnly the men and few women  surrounding him that had become as family to him nodded,  understanding his need to go, wishing to share his particular pain,  wishing they could help him through this grief, but each and every  one knew, that this was a cross that he needed to bear, and he alone  needed this pain, it would help him to grow as the old master had  wanted.</p><p>TBC...</p><p>A/N:  I think this one turned out well and hope to have the training trip  arc over with soon, the return to Nerima will promise some more of  the mayhem you're used to, I promise. And once again you all have my  prereader/editor Paul to thank for making this better than it was.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Technique  Translations:</b></p><p><b>Fukyuu  Eiyuu</b>- This means Immortal Hero, and is a ki blast which doesn't  use the emotional ki focus. It is not as strong as others in small  quantity, but when the levels are raised, than it becomes a force to  be reckoned with.</p><p><b>Mouretsu  Reikon:</b> The Violent Soul/Rage Spirit is an anger based blast,  that instead of feeding anger and causing it to grow in the manner of  the Shi Shi Hokodan, instead it feeds from the anger and drains the  emotion as if one had raged them self to sleep, without the sleep  part.</p>
