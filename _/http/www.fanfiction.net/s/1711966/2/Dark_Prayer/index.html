</div><p>Dark Prayer</p><p>By: X-Zero</p><p>Disclaimer: I don't own  Ranma ½, those characters belong to Rumiko Takahashi. All  music belongs to their respective artists and the record companies  that represent them.</p><p><b>Chapter 2- The Edge</b></p><p>The school day went by  surprisingly normally, discounting the fact that Kuno was still  unconscious in the infirmary. This meant that Ranma's habit of late,  actually paying attention in class, was being observed with a bit of  fear. The pigtailed one observed his classes boredly, not finding  anything among the curriculum he didn't already know. Of course, when  the class topic is involving physics, there are no higher authorities  on their laws than one Saotome Ranma. He sat in class, noting a few  mistakes being made by the teacher, but nothing worth noting really,  just slight miscalculations in minor parts of the formulas, he could  almost be called focused, until the bell rang. In an instant he had  crossed the room and pushed easily out the window, tucking into a  roll in midair.</p><p>As he reached the ground  another brief flare of his ki could be felt by the sensitive or  trained, and in that instant his near terminal velocity had slowed  dramatically and he set down on the ground without raising dust. He  strode casually to his tree, his refuge from the moronic commonality  that was the student populace, each holding some odd superstition  about the young man, each equally wrong in their assumption. So far  the only ones to get to know him were Hiroshi and Daisuke, and even  then, since getting together with Yuka and Sayuri respectively they  had less guy time. The two hormone driven teens could be seen chasing  after the pair of coeds, apologizing profusely for something they had  apparently said, he smiled bitterly as he leapt into a low branch of  the tree, pulling out the wrapped bento and saying a silent thank you  to the eldest Tendo sister. He opened his lunch and inhaled the  wonderful aroma of still warm rice and strips of steak. He started  eating the delicious treat slowly, not having to worry about his food  being stolen by his greedy father, or poisoned by a lunatic gymnast.</p><p>"Hiya Ranchan!"  Ranma looked down and saw the smiling face of Ukyo gazing back up to  him as he finished the bento, a plate with a fresh Okonomiyaki being  offered up to him as he ate his bento. He smiled softly at the young  woman, she cared about him so much he knew, but restrained herself  from being overbearing, an attitude she had adopted since the failed  wedding, having been shocked at her own behavior. He couldn't fault  her entirely, she had serious abandonment issues, not that he'd put  it in so many words.</p><p>"Thanks Ucchan." He said, wolfing down  the pizza-like dish in a couple of bites, savoring the flavor of the  well made pie as he stuffed it in his stomach.</p><p>"That was  delicious, thank you." He said, having emptied his mouth of  food. He'd barely had time to swallow before he heard a sound he had  come to dread second only to Kodachi's maniacal cackle.</p><p><i>BRING BRING</i></p><p>A bicycle bell, so simple  a thing that would seem so innocent to so many, but not to him, he  knew the horrors such a thing could cause. He darted from the tree  limb and pushed Ukyo out of the path of the descending aluminum  transportation before…</p><p><i>CRASH</i></p><p>It was an interesting  predicament, being stuck beneath the tires of a bike, treads digging  into his back, while head and his arms thrust forward, spread in a  vague warding gesture. He hadn't even been given the chance to  recover before being subjected to another one of those cruel  punishments fitting only for those that spawned evil, hateful things,  like the teletubbies.</p><p>"Nihao airen, I bring you too too  delicious ramen. You eat than take Shampoo on date, yes?" Asked  as the bicycle was tossed to the wayside, and he was gathered into a  bone crushing... embrace, one might call it.</p><p>Ranma could only groan  slightly, his air cut off and the darkness swimming across his vision  in small spots as he slowly turned a deep blue. Weakly and only if  one listened carefully could you hear the strangled plea.</p><p>"Le'go,  help me." He tried, but failed to break the Amazon's grip around  the base of his diaphragm. Though she probably couldn't get her off  of him, Ukyo sure as hell was going to try, she rushed towards them.</p><p>"Let go of Ranchan you bimbo." She said, bringing her  combat spatula to bear. Near the edge of the oblivion, Ranma's danger  sense sent a jolt through him, rousing him. Oh shit, trouble.</p><p>Ranma panicked, Shampoo  and Ukyo weren't safe, and they wouldn't sense the attack until they  couldn't avoid it. An instant was enough to formulate a plan. Finding  his focus he released enough ki that his aura surged outward in a  strange shockwave. Both girls were blown back by the density and  expulsion of tightly reigned bio-energy, clearing the blast zone as  the young man reigned his aura back into his body, weaving it tightly  into every cell, pushing each to its limits. His perceptions returned  to the physical, watching as chains, daggers, and a varied assortment  of pointy, slicy, and poundy type death annihilated the ground where  he was moments earlier, lifting dirt and rock into the air, masking  his position in the air until his ascent carried him over the bloom  of earth.</p><p>He scanned the immediate area, finding his target a short  distance away before loosing that feral grin. The earpieces were  still there, despite being brained. His lips formed words spoken to  seemingly no one. "Mousse" The song began, he knew its  name, One Step Closer, by the American group Linkin Park. He grinned,  gathering energy around his fists as he fell toward the blind-ish  Amazon male. "Hey duck boy, this is it, I'm tired of your shit."  He yelled, not hearing his opponent's response. Probably  something about how I'm trying to seduce shampoo. He thought  irritated as he released his own barrage of attacks.</p><p>"Ryuusei  Ame!" His fists glowed red as restrained rage filled his fists  and unleashed the feelings into Mousse, the hard way.</p><p>The punches rained down  on the painfully near-sighted Amazon for nearly ten seconds, each red  coated fist exploding against his white robes, the fist pumping back  to regain its scarlet hue, each fleshy weapon alternating in this  fashion. Finally, with a rage filled scream Ranma threw a last punch,  the force and expelled ki exploding around his fist. Both he and  Mousse were thrown backward by the larger than average burst of  energy. Mousse was thrown dazedly to land on his back, groaning as he  rose from his position, refusing to succumb to unconsciousness. He'd  win damnit! He wouldn't leave his beloved to this monstrous beast!  The myopic martial artist growled loudly and released a barrage of  chains at his enemy, the spiked links tearing through the air as the  morningstar heads plowed into the ground before Ranma before he  himself rushed inwards toward his hated foe.</p><p>"Die, enemy of  women! Kamo Hitouchi!"</p><p>A white-gold glow seemed  to swirl around he thrust his clenched fists outward, opening as he  struck. The glow launched forth, before showing to be dozens of small  feather shaped ki-bolts. The pigtailed hero quickly realized that his  opponent had trapped him, using his refusal to involve innocents in  his fights to keep him from dodging this attack. If he did he would  endanger the non-martial artist students who had flocked to the  fight. Determined he released his aura, and with the rapid release it  exploded outward. He threw his left arm out at a slight angle,  simultaneously doing the same with his right. The limbs moved so  quickly they tore the very air, and a pair of vacuum blades formed  within his aura, and immediately surged outward catching several of  the feathers in their wake, others within the blade itself, each  exploding on contact, their flow disrupted.</p>"That's enough! Put  one more of them in danger cause you wanna kill me duck boy, and I'll  show you why Saffron lost." He promised, his aura expanding with  hot anger, veins crimson pulsing through his aura of confidence.  Ranma's challenge went unrequited, and Mousse launched from his  volumous sleeves a heavy payload of chains at Ranma, leaving a crater  in place of his opponent whose anger could be felt in tangible waves  by everyone present, and masters throughout the island chain on which  Japan was situated. Ranma had not wasted a motion, sidestepping the  onslaught that scarred the school grounds, only suffering a few  shallow cuts from unearthed rocks. Ranma sneered at the pitiful man  he faced, and rushed Mousse from his standing position, his takeoff  speed pushing a rut into the concrete on which he stood from the  pressure.<p>As the pigtailed martial  artist charged his opponent those in the crowd normally unable to see  his aura were surprised, a bonfire of energy having been visible to  the mob of teenagers for the majority of the fight, their untrained  eyes marveling at the deadly beauty of Ranma's soul. They were all  shocked, having believed that the story about Ranma going to China,  and blowing up a mountain were exaggerated tales from an over  inflated ego, though now they could all share a common thought, one  who despised him more than any other on the grounds, Kuno Tatewaki  who watched everything from the window of the infirmary, finally  standing.</p><p>"Could it be that the mercenary Tendo spake the truth?  That the sorcerer journeyed to the mystic land of China to do mortal  combat with the Honou-tentei?" Others who were uncertain could  no longer deny what they saw before them.</p><p>A spinning back fist from  the left, reaping sweep to the ankles from the right, and the  ki-enhanced hammer fist to the back sent the myopic martial artist  crashing to the concrete, dazed and hurt. Ranma leapt back,  struggling to control the swelling rage within him, wanting  desperately for the boy to rise, he hadn't finished him, just  reminded him where his place was, his place in the pecking order,  Furinkan and Nerima were his, and he wasn't going to let any fool  wannabe take from him his territory, he'd show him that he wasn't at  all boasting when he said he was the best.</p><p>Mousse grunted in pain as  he rose to his slippered feet, he was determined to win; he'd do  anything to get Shampoo, anything. The moment he was able, he loosed  an armorer's cache of daggers at a rapid rate born of obvious  desperation, trying to ward of the slowly advancing form wreathed in  spirit fire. Unfortunately for him, the path of his knives was far  too widespread and even more unfortunately, would hit the students  were they to miss their target.</p><p>"Time to burn, ducky." His  anger bolstered his degrading strength, the protective aura having  taken great strength from him. His arms burned as power flooded them  to complete the task he had set before him.</p><p>"Nigori Hari!"  The pinpoint motes of light drew out of the air and between his  wrists; the energy coalesced and was thrust forth in a matter of  seconds, small bolts of directed ki spread from his body, reducing  the projectiles to molten slag with seemingly minimal effort. Then  with an expression of his enormous will he turned the remaining shots  of energy at his half-blind foe, each small bolt striking the Amazon  or the area around him detonating on impact. No small amount of rage  fueled his attack on the raven-haired Amazon. As he released his hold  on the technique, the myopic moron fell into unconsciousness, body  riddled with burns from the explosions and otherwise grievously  injured.</p><p>"Sleep mode." And the earpieces went silent, the  track ending. He then noticed to his horror that one blade had slid  through his guard, past him and into some innocent in his haste to  destroy them all. He lost any appearance of tired as he rushed toward  the downed girl, hilt of a dagger jutting out of her leg. He knelt  down to her, with a quickly diminishing look of panic, he needed to  stay calm. He appraised the wound with grim efficiency, no damaged  nerves; it had missed the artery but would need stitches. He quickly  tapped a few pressure points around the wound halting the slowing the  blood flow, and halting the majority of the bleeding.</p><p>"C'mon,  I'll take you to the nurse; she can help you until the ambulance  arrives." He said lifting her into tired arms, and began to  sprint, as fast as weary muscles would carry him, to the nurse, and  the infirmary.</p><p>Akane, whom had stayed  inside until she heard Ranma's technique explode against dozens of  blades and a blind duck, only saw him lifting a random girl and  running off with her, so she followed his path to the entryway,  hurrying to find him, jealousy and anger clouding her mind from  noticing the obvious, such as the unconscious Amazon, the craters, or  even the dozens of melted knives that lay as glowing pools on the  concrete.</p><p>In the infirmary Ranma  was resting on a cot that had been set up for unconscious members of  the hentai horde, ingesting a gross amount of the leftover lunch  menu, hunger having gotten to him after his worries were sated. The  paramedics had arrived shortly after he had, and were instructing the  injured girl, who, now removed from his battle haze, Ranma recognized  as Akane's friend Yuka, how to use the crutches she'd need to use for  a while as her leg healed.</p><p>Akane made it to the  infirmary as the paramedics left, gone off to deal with things  elsewhere within the city. There she saw Ranma, obviously gorging  himself after doing perverted things with some hussy. With that  thought she decided he needed to be punished, and so she went she  stomped toward him, her anger driven battle aura, swirling up into a  blaze of jealousy and rage. She pulled out her mallet and dealt the  blow she felt was divine justice being delivered.
