</div><p>"You  have all long wanted me for your own devices, defeat me now and I'll  grant your wish." Ranma announced in a grave tone. He settled  into a fighting stance, not of the school they were all so familiar  with, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>"This  shall now begin, the final act of this life," he smirked, taunting  them to move. "I have no desire for any of your deaths, but if you  insist on being fools, I will put you in your place."</p><p>There  was death in those words, uncertainty that had once been there was  gone. A dark gleam in his eye gave a moment's pause to the mass of  fools. This was beginning to scare the fiancées; Ranma would  never hurt them, would he?</p><p>No,  he was just kidding about that part, they decided. No matter how  unsure they were, they would beat him, if it meant that'd make him  theirs...</p><p><b>Dark  Prayer</b></p><p>By:  XZero and Paul</p><p>Disclaimer:  I don't own Ranma 1/2.</p><p><b>Chapter 5 - The Demon Within</b></p><p>Rage,  rage was what he felt. It was common since Saffron, but before that,  all he had was his "father" to focus his hate towards. He hated  the people around him, more than any realized. He wanted them dead;  he wanted them to suffer for the pain they inflicted upon him, to pay  for what they had done. Ranma looked out on the collected fighters,  thinly veiled disgust clear to those who knew him. He didn't want  to keep his rage in check anymore; he didn't want to let them get  away with feeling no pain. It was time for them to suffer as he had!  He closed his eyes again and concentrated on the energy lurking deep  within him.</p><p>"Die  Saotome!" Cried the voices of the men, a word relinquished  with great disdain, while the females screeched incoherently about  their love for the pigtailed warrior. He stopped thinking of himself  as a simple Martial Artist after Saffron, stopped being one who  learned the art for no other reason than to improve. He now he felt  the dark urges as well, the battle lust. He knew fighting for those  cared for would stain his hands with more blood, as he was now. Go  figure, I never thought this day would come, but now it's time to  return the favor they gave me over the years. His eyes hardened  and he waited for the men, slowly approaching him. Well slow to him,  he heard a voice in the back of his mind, a shadow from years ago.</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>"My  son, there may come a time when you have no other choice but to end a  life to save the lives of others, and when that day comes, you must  strike decisively and quickly, there is no room for regret in the  warrior's path." The shadow recited from some old tale he had  heard at some point.</p><p>"What's  the difference Pops?" a semi-interested chibi-ranma asked.</p><p>"A  warrior must be prepared to do whatever is necessary to achieve their  goals, and realize that taking a life may be required. A modern  martial artist should never know the weight that one has to carry  after taking a life, or the responsibility that power holds. It is  what you are required to be my son; no one else can carry the burden  you can." And from there the memory faded.</p><p><i>End Flashback</i></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"It's  time," he whispered, snapping his eyes open and staring at the  beast known as the Nerima Wrecking Crew to some. Back into this  world, he ducked a barrage of ki-charged bandanas, only to leap into  the air to avoid the chains that the myopic hidden weapons master had  thrown and twist out of the way of a series of throwing spatulas. He  landed gracefully only to come face to face with Shampoo who had  hoped to take advantage of the throwing weapons and attack him while  distracted. Her efforts were rewarded with a hard kick to the right  knee. An audible pop was heard, as Shampoo fell, trying hard not to  cry out. Ranma sneered at the downed fighter, looking like he would  attack again, when he leapt away from a gas grenade and flour bomb,  leaving the mace wielder to suffer their effects.<p>Kodachi  He growled and cursed himself for being careless, swiftly reaching  the apex of his jump. The fact that these fools thought the same  thing would keep on working. He growled in disgust, ready to end  something he should have long ago. He felt the disgust wash over him,  disgust at himself for letting this go on.</p><p>"No  more games!" He screamed loudly, as his aura sprung back into  view, wreathed around him like the corona around the sun.</p><p>"Shinsei  Honoo!"</p><p>His  aura exploded outward, sending waves of power out amongst the teenage  fighters, each cringing back momentarily under the frightening image  that was Ranma. This was what the God of Phoenix Mountain had faced,  a warrior holding nothing back. This is what each feared secretly  they themselves would face.</p><p>Ukyo  felt her heart stop at the sight of her friend. The fire in his eyes,  and the rage pouring off him were enough to bring her to her knees.  Shocked out of the battle craze she had arrived in, she realized that  she had let herself be caught up in things, that she was not the  friend she claimed to be. She shuddered at the thought of the things  she had done, of how she had become like the others, like her  father...</p><p>No, I can't; I won't live like this! I am his  friend, I am, I promised him… With that she dropped her battle  spatula to the ground, the clatter from the weapon could be heard all  around but due to the situation going on around her, she was ignored  by all but one.</p><p>In  the shadows she watched it all unfold, as she had for the last  eighteen years. Finally a chance</p><p>Ryouga  was the first to regain his "backbone," if one could call it  that, and charged. He would see this end; his enemy would finally die  for all that he had done. He watched as his hated foe dodged his  first punch, only to be hit with a punch just beneath the ribs. Even  the breaking point training didn't hurt like this. What was going  on? He fell back, letting lose with a barrage of charged bandana's  that Ranma destroyed with his battle aura, or in Ryouga's mind ran  from the coward he was. He leapt towards Ranma again, only this time  the warrior met him in midair, where fist met fist. Ryouga pouring  all his anger and hatred into his fists, speed was what he needed  now.</p><p>This Ranma was unlike any he had fought before, and try as he  might; this Ranma was beating him, with a brutal ease. Ranma's speed  was uncanny, his strength, too was nothing to laugh at. Just what was  happening to him? This wasn't the fighter he had hunted for so  long. No matter, he would kill him either way.</p><p>He  was quickly losing in to his rage and he realized that, and finally  as Ranma sent him flying back toward the ground, having used him as a  spring board to gain more height, he went into that rage, using it to  give him the strength he was sorely lacking right now. He refused to  end it there.</p><p>"For all the things you've done Ranma, you'll  pay!" The sometimes-pig, cried angrily at the turnout of the  first clash. His thoughts turned dark, the sea of depression inside  him swelled as memories of defeat returned to him, Akane's smile, the  one he wished for immensely, being given to Ranma, and never to him  (A/N: This is Ryouga's interpretation of the world), the rain, the  curse, all of it, it was all Ranma's fault. With the depression and  hatred, Ryouga's aura exploded by triple any he'd ever made.</p><p>"Time  to die! Ascension of the Damned!"</p><p>A  pillar of swirling black and green energy tore up the ground around  him, and than upward. The huge energy blast caught Ranma with its  sheer size and his inability to dodge.</p><p>Larger  than any Ultimate Ki blast he had thrown before, Ryouga slumped down,  completely spent. He watched as the projectile careened towards his  rival, when his eyes shot open. Ranma wasn't trying to dodge; he  was gathering energy from everything around them. Not even he had  learned how to control the power of nature yet. He watched as the new  warrior raised his hands towards the sphere and smiled.</p><p>"And the  lord said, let there be light," he smirked.</p><p>"Fukyuu  Eiyuu" He screamed, launching the condensed blast of ki at the  titanic projectile.</p><p>The  blasts collided, and detonated. Everyone covered their eyes as the  blinding light burned their retina. By the time Ryouga had regained  his vision Ranma was gone. Ranma appeared a heartbeat later with a  sadistic smile plastered across his face,</p><p>"Not very nice, you  could hurt someone." Ranma said, wagging a finger at the  speechless berserker.</p><p>"You may have thought you have had the power  advantage Ryouga, but now it's time to show you your place."</p><p>Ryouga  thought he understood pain, thought he had endured so much over his  lifetime, but the beating he was now receiving was nothing compared  to that. Ranma had already broken an arm, and was blasting away at  his midsection. His ribs had cracked in their first exchange, making  breathing incredibly hard. Right now he would settle for hard  breathing compared to having the air forced out with each punch.  Ranma then grabbed him over his head, and slammed him down across the  knee. He fell to the ground, stunned at the power he felt coming from  Ranma, but it was not the end. Ranma, wanting him to suffer, lifted  his broken body and decided the mouth needed reworking. He let him  fall free for a moment, long enough catch him in the jaw. Ryouga  wanted to cry at the injustice of it all, how the hell was Ranma this  strong?</p><p>Each bone rattling punch caused his body to shudder. He  didn't know, even with his endurance, if it would be possible to  survive much more of a beating. Strike after strike came, but the  third set of them a new friend of Ranma's had made an appearance.  Black and blue flame covered his fists as he launched into another  combo. As the final hit came, a right uppercut that caught the  bandana-clad fighter just beneath his shattered ribs, they stared at  the blazing with blue flame.</p><p>The  final strike sent the fanged martial artist spiraling to the ground,  beaten into a bloody pulp. Ranma suddenly felt something brush  against his aura. A meaty thud followed swiftly by a resounding clang  of metal rang out in the morning as a bonbori struck the ground. Bad  move Amazon he thought turning to face Shampoo.</p><p>Shampoo  had barely managed to escape the paralysis gas and explosive batter,  an agonizing experience with the injury inflicted by her "Airen".  She could not believe the battle between pig-boy and her Airen; he  had not been as vicious with the Phoenix God as he was right now.   Damn male, he will be brought to heal her illusions of Ranma  being shattered with each punch. She waited until the fool pig had  fallen to make her move.</p><p>Now  she cursed her stupidity at not guarding her legs. Her speed halved  by her "Airen" breaking her knee, she thought she had him,  launching her bonbori at him. He didn't seem aware of it at all,  the perfect opportunity. When his aura set the weapon to the ground  like a useless piece of metal, she knew she was in trouble. She  watched her Airen turn, and cringed at the smile.</p><p>"Time to pay,  Amazon." He growled with feral menace permeating his voice.</p><p>She  was unprepared, when the fist was buried to mid forearm in her  stomach. She bent over, not even her Great-grandmother hit that hard,  gasping for air, coughing up blood. Ranma wasn't done, though; he  lifted her into the air by her neck, and smiled as he pulled his hand  back. Blue and black fire still encased them, Blue and black fire  from the pits of hell.</p><p>She  watched as Ranma brought the fist forward. It was the last thing she  would see this day.</p><p>Ranma  enjoyed beating the over amorous Amazon. He enjoyed inflicting pain  against them as they had done him. He dropped the Amazon's  motionless corpse to the ground. She was still alive; he wasn't  that merciful to grant them liberty through death. They had a price  to pay to him after all...</p><p>"Two  fools down, anyone want to just give up now, and save us all the  trouble?" He asked, smirking, and knowing that none would take  his offer. It was alright by him after all, they didn't deserve any  mercy in his mind.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kuno,  having seen the foul villain's latest works of black magic, called  out a fierce battle cry, charging the pigtailed demon, viciously  stabbing forward with his greatest technique.<p>"Strike! Strike!  Strike!" It was meaningless to the new warrior. He flowed with  the attack, the gusts of wind meaning nothing to him. Kuno screamed,  not letting up, even as the coward came to a stop.</p><p>"Shakespeare,  this one is for you." Ranma stated with a chuckle and smirk. He  grabbed the bokken and let lose with the blue-black flame. Kuno  screamed in pain as blue and black tendrils of energy invaded his  body.</p><p>"You want to see dark powers, let me show you a bit of what I  am capable of!" Kuno's screams before he passed out were by far  the worst so far.</p><p>Ranma  smirked as the next fighter, Mousse, came forward. Deciding the time  for mercy was over; he grabbed Mouse and poured black fire into him.  He cried out in pain, the foreign energy more than anyone could take.  He lifted Mousse and turned around just in time to catch Mousse  across the face with a reverse crescent kick, why not show off on  such a weak fool. He was not fighting an equal, why should he show  off. He grabbed the blind fighter one more time slapping him a couple  times so that he was awake.</p><p>"I  want you to see this, because you  will see it only once." Ranma smirked and then with a cry of the  pigtailed man's attack he was laid to waste the worthless fool with  an assault of vicious high speed punches. Letting Mousse drop he  cringed as a hateful laughter filled the air.</p><p>Kodachi  laughed insanely, "Hohoho, finally those peasants are defeated,  come Ranma-sama, let us run away together." She screeched as she  dove forward, a maniacal gleam in her eyes.</p><p>"Not  a chance, you psychotic bitch." He said calmly, gathering dark  fire into his hands, and with renewed power he pressed forward again.  Needless to say, after he was done Kodachi would never be doing  Gymnastics again.</p><p>Cologne  lost balance on her staff and landed roughly on the floor, Happi  sprawled next to her.</p><p>"I... I just barely saw him" They  both muttered as one. The group of super powerful martial artists had  been devastated, each and every one. They had held the advantage of  numbers, not that they were intelligent enough to use it, but each  still had been decimated by a single fighter. They had all fallen,  all except a certain chef, who now looked up from her turmoil to gaze  upon the warrior who stood before her.</p><p>"R-Ranchan?"  Ukyo ventured, wondering why she had been spared the devastating  attack. Ukyo couldn't find the words, she left speechless, at least,  until she felt a hand on her shoulder. The tomboyish okonomiyaki chef  looked up with a touch of fear in her eyes, and saw a smiling Ranma  looking down at her.</p><p>"Don't worry Ucchan, things will be okay in  the end, I promise. I will take all the pain away." The young  man stated before seemingly groping her chest, she had thoughts to  get angry, but just as she registered herself being felt up by the  pigtailed man, she lost coherency as she too entered the land of  dreams.</p><p>The  dark power coming from Ranma was too much for them to stand by. Both  Cologne and Happi charged, knowing they had to stop him before he  decided to finish the job. He smirked, pouring more energy. He  dropped Ukyo, just before giving her the release of death, and moved  to match the old crones, taking a speed inherent stance. His aura  flashed brightly for a moment, and in that instant he ran forward at  full speed. They never knew what hit them, as he sent them into  oblivion as well. He thought of giving them the release, but in  truth, they were not ready. Why should they be given such a gift? He  went back to Ukyo, his eyes sad, but ready to give her a release from  the pain. He stopped when the shadow appeared beside him, a soft hand  on his exposed shoulder.</p><p>"It's  enough Reiko," she said in a soft voice, tenderly pleading her case  with moist eyes locked on his. "You have let them feel your pain,  don't kill them."</p>"Kijin  Raishu Dan!" His danger sense and hearing saved the day for an  innocent bystander. He gently pushed the redheaded mystery woman away  as the vacuum blade slid past his extended left arm, leaving a deep  gash in his arm and tearing a rut in the ground. The aquatransexual  warrior spun away from the attack, pulling his arm away quickly  enough to keep it. He growled as a feral and raging energy fueled  him. He took hold of that power and poured into his palm, and he felt  the energy boil. How dare his father! No, not your father! Just  some greedy man who wanted to use you. A part of him said to  himself.<p>The  shadowy woman cursed, rolling backward as the air distortion caused a  tiny cloud of Ranma's blood to spray the air. She felt the energy  come forth for his next attack. She knew she had been taking a risk,  but the guards had to be slipped soon, if things were to change.  There had to be a way to stop this.</p><p>As  he finished his spin he pushed his hand forward, an angry red ball of  energy rocketing forth from his outstretched palm. So powerful was  the attack that he reached forward and held his other arm at the  wrist, adding what support the injury appendage could to the  stability.</p><p>"Mouretsu Reikon!" He cried out, the beach ball  sized blast flying an arrow's path to the boy's "father"  detonating with a bomb's fury, leveling the majority of the house.</p><p>Soun  had charged before the Violent Soul could explode against his rotund  compatriot and escaped the brunt of the attack. He though was caught  in the aftershock, being launch toward his quarry by the shockwave.  Just as well, he thought to himself, and lined his body to meet the  pigtailed one head on. He threw a devastating forward punch as he  landed right before his would be son-in-law, continuing his forward  momentum to add strength to muscles disused for so long. He was sure  this would be his day; he'd defeat the boy and show him the error of  his ways, only to be put down faster than Akane had the other day. He  growled, kicking the man's ribs in. So many unworthy fools around  him; could none of them even bother to give him a real challenge?</p><p>"Damn."  She whispered in awe, as she witnessed the brutal beating of the  weeping man.</p><p>"Calm down Reiko," the shadow yelled. He turned  to face her, and she leapt toward him again. For the first time his  blue eyes went soft.</p><p>"What  did you call me?" Ranma asked. He looked around in horror at the  downed bodies. Had he done all of this?</p><p>"Damn  it." she cursed. "I should have been more careful."</p><p>She  breathed a sigh when he didn't push her any farther. He seemed more  entranced by the carnage his unlocked temper had caused. I wish  it wasn't necessary, but he has to see…he has to understand how  far he has left to go She watched him; silently wishing that he  would be alright, the rage had subsided for her, however slightly.</p><p>Can  I just let them die like this, I have my freedom, do I need to kill  them as well? His mind questioned quickly. No! They may have  brought me pain, but without giving them the chance to make amends I  am nothing but a murderer. I am no better than my father. He  decided, and concentrated hard.</p><p>"Hitokage no Aisu!" His  cold aura exploded outward from his body, the wall of cold chi  battling hard for dominance as the sweat that dripped from his brow  froze and crystallized. Everything that had been left burning by his  expression of pure rage was misting as the air cooled, and continued  to cool, and finally froze bits of moisture in the air, causing snow  to fall around the ruins of the Tendo house, putting out the fires.</p>The  elder Tendo daughters and Nodoka reached the dojo shortly after the  explosion had subsided. When they reached the remainder of the gate  they looked in, and saw Ranma, standing amidst a frozen waste. The  entire house hand very nearly been leveled, along with the majority  of the dojo, the only things left untouched by the disaster was the  koi pond, and even there the top of water was frozen solid.<p>"The  end." Stated the pigtailed youth, turning to them. Nabiki almost  lost her footing then, from the look in his eyes. Before her stood  not a boy of near eighteen years, before her stood a time wearied  warrior. He turned to them and Nabiki almost lost her footing.  Standing before them was no boy of near 18, no; this was a young man  who looked to have weathered a storm of incredible intensity. Gone  was the soft innocence in his eyes, replaced by an intensity that  they had only seen during his battles, this was the Ranma that had  gained her respect and love, the man whose hard gaze brooked no  argument. His hair was streaked with traces of silver, which shone in  the morning sun, his pants were mere strips of cloth, and shirt was  non-existent, the women noted.</p><p>The  new look seemed to suit him more than any could ever say. It in fact  seemed as if it had been there the entire time, waiting to be seen by  others.</p><p>Ranma  had finished, he had fulfilled both his self-appointed duties,  freedom, and it was now his, along with the preservation of life. He  turned around to the gate to see his mother standing there with a  bundle in her arms, but confusingly, his keen perception noticed the  bundle that carried her sword on her back. He smiled softly to the  three women of importance in his life.</p><p>His  danger sense was still going. What was going on? He knew it wasn't  the woman who had appeared before, he knew he could trust her, but  something was still not right. Twisting out of the way of a  projectile, he felt Taro; he knew that ki pattern anywhere,  especially with the warped aura he gave off when in his cursed form.  This would need to be quick to prevent him from noticing the women,  if he did, things would get ugly.</p><p>"Shinkou  Ken!" He stated as he completed the technique, Pantyhose's  motion stunned, the aura expanded and formed a cloud of pinpoint ki  spheres.</p><p>Taro  didn't understand it, he shouldn't have been able to sense him, but  he did. The pigtailed asshole (in his opinion anyhow) had opened up  with a pretty strong kick, he'd realized this when he felt the  reeling and pain generally associated with a fight with the annoying  femboy. He landed shakily but despite this still charged his foe,  that is, until he felt the sting of hundreds of small needles.</p><p>"Tenshi  Shouten" He heard his enemy say as his aura expanded violently,  shoving him back, Damn you femboy, just die! Which of course  came out a bit more like this.</p><p>"MOO!" Taro shouted,  feeling the intense anger, and whether admitted or not, depression,  at all the times he had been defeated in his quest to change his  name. He'd seen the process enough times, and had finally mastered  it, wasn't hard given how pathetic his existence was, and now it  would be unleashed. Damn you Ranma! Shi Shi Hokodan! Again  due to the translation between human thought, and yeti/cow language  his words were warped into</p><p>"MOO-OOO-MOOOOO!" He cried out,  pouring his emotions into his attack, he'd never expect this one,  Taro thought to himself.</p><p>Taro  thought wrong, Ranma's aura flare receded quickly after it's initial  purpose, because there he stood, the silver lining to his hair  increased, his eyes were silver as well, a by-product of flooding his  entire body with energy.</p><p>"Time's up Taro, time to lose."  Ranma ran forward into the ki blast, dropping into a slide he fired a  quick flare from his hands as he went, sending the depression and  anger based move careening into the sky to dissipate safely. Out of  the slide the pigtailed warrior flipped forward, his fists glowed  red/silver as they were brought to bear against Taro's hide.</p><p>"Ryuusei  Ame!" He whispered, pouring punch after punch into his foe,  tearing through the toughness of the Minotaur. With each explosion,  which had changed from the usual rage red, to a serene silver, taking  just and instant to gather strength, Ranma thrust his arm up into  Pantyhose's exposed undercarriage, propelling Taro into the air.</p><p>"Kyuukyoku Keibatsu!" Were the last words Taro heard that  day, or for roughly a week, for that matter, because then, while the  monster man was midair and stunned, Ranma leapt to follow, bringing a  midair tackle with him, holding tightly and using his upward inertia  to spin and throw the beast to the ground again. All was ended when  the neo-silver eyed man landed atop his foe, an over handed and  unnamed blast of energy pounded into Taro's chest. The artistic  brutality was frighteningly beautiful, and left them stunned as they  listened to his following speech.</p><p>"This  is the end for Ranma Saotome, he is dead, fallen amongst those he  once called friend, and now, I am free." The young man stated  softly as he looked in the direction of his only true family. The  women cringed as he fell to the ground hard, his hair losing the  silver highlighting, now maintaining only the very light hints of  them he had, eyes faded back into the grey-blue others were used to.  He was falling, but did not die as he expected. He knew that he  should have, he'd expended so much ki today that he should have died,  he should be weak as a kitten, instead he just felt tired, and so he  slept.</p><p>The  cloaked figure was the first to jump and catch him and ease him to  the ground. She crouched beside the god slayer; a gentle hand stroked  his cheek gently, lovingly. "Rest now Reiko, soon you will be  all better. Soon, I promise."</p><p>She  calmly removed the cloak and wrapped it around the sleeping fighter.  With the cloak gone she is revealed to be an immensely beautiful  woman of roughly 20. Long red hair flowed down her back like a mane  of fire, she wasn't particularly muscled but one could tell from the  way she stood that she was a seasoned fighter of incredible power.</p><p>Her form seemed to scream power and grace, not terribly different  from Ranma's. Nabiki looked the redhead over, and noted the silver  silk tunic and black stitching hiding a bust that, while the same  size as Ranma's female form, looked smaller on her slightly larger  and mature frame. The loose black pants she wore tied at apparently  the same place as Ranma's as well, the ankles and waist. She wore the  same slippers that the pigtailed young man wore as well. She looked  out to the three women moving toward her and Ranma,</p><p>"Hello, I'm  Ranko Metsuretsu." Her disarming smile and polite disposition  caught the Tendo girls off guard but was welcomed by Ranma's mother,  whose mind swam with pride over her son, and slight wonderment at the  last name of the girl. It felt familiar, but she could not grasp why.</p><p>Nabiki  looked this new girl over again and again; she was a mystery that she  had to figure out. Who is she? Why does she dress and look like  Ranma? She pushed that thought aside to deal with later.</p><p>"What  do you want with Ranma?" She asked as she looked over to the  prone form of her pseudo-brother, assessing his condition with an  ease born of practice. He's just tired, doesn't look like  there'll be any real problems. But he'll need to have his arm looked  after. her analysis completed quickly and efficiently, the skills  she was less than proud of still held some use.</p><p>"More  than you could imagine," Ranko smiled looking at the silent form of  Reiko. He couldn't remember his past, but soon he would. Soon all  would be right with the former and new warrior.</p><p>Kasumi  could only mutter to herself about poor Ranma-kun, he wasn't hurt,  she could tell from looking at the way her breathed.</p><p>"Oh my,  this is my fault, all of it." She said darting to his side and  assessing the damage to him the moment he was uncovered slightly by  the cloak, noticing only the gash on his arm which was tended to  quickly with the tatters of a pant leg. Aside from the minor things  he had suffered during the week, such as a few burns, he was fine,  albeit his skin was extremely cold. Her breath fogged in the air.  Remembering her position as lady of the house and hostess, she  quickly turned back to Ranko as she covered Ranma again in the cloak,  which she realized was incredibly heavy material.</p><p>"How can we  help you, Metsuretsu-san?"</p><p>Nodoka  looked over the girl, and nodded.</p><p>"I remember, when he was just  an infant, you, you were the one who gave these to me, weren't you?"  She said holding up the bundle of items, the bracers and scabbard  shined in the cold sunlight.</p><p>"Why, what could he use these for?"  She asked, fear of losing her only child apparent in the pleading  tone she took.</p><p>"Saotome-san,  Ranma needs to remember who he was, with the power he has it would be  dangerous if he kept using it without knowing what it is, and what  it's for. That, and he wants to be a better person, but Ranma Saotome  can't do that, that's why he wanted his freedom. His father would  have kept him here to teach for the rest of his life with bullshit  dressed in honor sauce, and he wouldn't have had a chance to grow. I  have seen him, he's too much like he used to be, a wanderer."  She paused to collect herself again,</p><p>"Now please, please, give  me the bracers to give to him, they'll help him to control his anger  until he's got enough focus."</p><p>She  stated with a bit of urgency that unnerved the swordswoman. What  could cause her to want to take such a precaution while he's asleep?  She questioned silently, and as if by answer, Ranma's aura began to  take life again, the menacing glow spreading slowly but surely from  the young warrior.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  was unconscious, of that he was sure. Why he was standing in a  blindingly white hallway, with doors off to each side, he couldn't  quite grasp.<p>"Ranma, it is time for you to awaken from your  dream." A familiar voice stated, oddly enough though he realized  why this voice was familiar, it was his after all. He spun on his  heel, and found himself face to face with, himself.</p><p>"Who...  who're you?" He asked of his twin.</p><p>"I am you, or at least,  who you used to be." Ranma couldn't deal with this, he needed to  restore his energy before the others awoke, and this guy wasn't  making sense, I wish you would just tell me what you mean, I'm  too tired to deal with this. As if he had read his mind the other  man introduced himself, "I am Reiko Metsuretsu, and you are  reincarnated from me."</p><p>TBC...</p><p>Before  the translations I would like to give special credit to my editor  Paul, who wrote as much of this chapter as I did, and has given me so  much help that I can't honestly express my thanks but with the meager  tribute to him in the by-line. So said, now on with translations.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Techniques  Translations:</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Mouretsu  Reikon:</b> A manifestation of all the anger and rage that Ranma can sum  up, this attack means Rage Spirit or Violent Soul.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Hitokage  no Aisu:</b> This is the soul of ice; this particular use of the  technique was a shield. It countered the intense heat and energy of  the Mouretsu Reikon.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Shinsei  Honoo:</b> The Rebirth Flame. This is an aura attack, the displacement  caused by the aura growing violently causes energy shockwaves.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Fukyuu  Eiyuu:</b> Immortal Hero. This attack consists of a ki flare, it is  generally a close range takedown technique, this time however, it was  used to smokescreen Ranma's position, and in turn to evade the  giant ki blast.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Ryuusei  Ame:</b> Meteor Rain. The supercharged high speed punch attack utilizes  ki blasts that explode against the recipient/victim on contact.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Musabetsu  Kakuto Ryuu: </b>Otherwise known as Anything Goes Martial Arts.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Shinkou  Ken:</b> Rising Blade. This attack charges a limb with ki, and is  performed with a jump, doesn't matter what kind. The general usage  however, is a back flip kick, which propels a ki blade at the  opponent.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Tenshi  Shouten:</b> Divine Ascension. This is another aura technique; this one  isn't of Ranma's creation. It was merely something that came to him  when he needed it, why he knew it will be clarified in later  chapters. This aura technique is like that of a Super Saiyajin  transformation, in that it floods the entire body with more ki than  it can handle, forcing it to adapt, the more it is used the easier  the technique is to perform.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Kyuukyoku  Keibatsu:</b> Final Judgment. This technique is an end combo. After a  barrage of attacks Ranma will send his opponent into the air with any  technique necessary, and follow them with a rising tackle (not in the  King of Fighters sense either at least I don't think so, never saw  one happen) after grabbing the stunned opponent he then stands up his  opponent as they fall, and ending the entire thing with a ki blast to  the chest to lay them low.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Reiko  Metsuretsu:</b> Great Spirit in Chaos. This one brooks no explanation, as  it would be telling if I said anything.</p><p>I  hope everyone will enjoy this chapter; I lengthened the combat and  cut short on a bit of the talking, as people specifically requested a  no holds barred combat against the NWC. I have finished the bit of  revision that I thought necessary on this chapter as well.</p>
