</div><p><b>Dark Prayer</b></p><p>By X-Zero</p><p>Disclaimer: I don't own  Ranma 1/2 and I don't own the copyrights to Papa Roaches' music.  Please don't sue me, I don't have any money.</p><p><b>Chapter One- Last Resort</b></p><p>The day hadn't been going  well for him, okay more than any other day. Ranma jumped from the  ground just a before the ground he was standing on became a crater.</p><p>"You feelin' okay P-Chan? You don't usually suck this much."  He taunted, barely managing to avoid a quick barrage of striped  bandanas, a shallow cut on his arm the price paid for his hasty  evasion.</p><p>"Damn you Ranma stay  still and DIE!" He shouted with his battle aura blooming outward  as an onslaught of painful and despairing memories assaulted him.</p><p>"Perfect Shi Shi Hokodan!" Ryoga screamed as the blast went  soaring at Ranma.</p><p>"Shit!" The  pigtailed martial artist called out, eyes widening as he pushed  himself harder, hastily gathering his aura between cupped palms.  Ranma Saotome NEVER loses! His confidence in this truth caused the  brilliant ball of blue plasma to grow, swelling with pride.</p><p>"Mouko  Takabisha!" He watched his blast soar at the green ovoid and  despaired slightly, it wasn't enough, his energy levels were  dangerously low, and he doubted he could manage another one, not that  it would matter. That's it, and with the last bit of auxiliary energy  he could muster, the world slowed considerably, his entire form  encompassed in the speed technique, the name of which he could not  recall. Defeat meant death and that wasn't an option. He knew that  last ditch blast wouldn't stop Ryoga's hatred, it wouldn't work. As  the blast raced toward him, crashing through his own with ease he set  things into motion. Just a little more. He drew everything he  could from his surroundings, allowing the cold of the soul of ice to  condense into a swirling orb within his left hand, the temperature  around him dropped rapidly as his unique version of cold rage took  over, the orb still bleeding off an awful cold. He concentrated  harder than ever before, pulling the last of the icy energy generated  by the technique into the sphere; he thrust his arms forward,  carefully directing the frozen orb with supreme mental exertion.</p>In real-time, Ryoga saw  something wrong as the air around Ranma seemed to freeze and draw  inward, swirling into him. The cold reaching him he felt something  wrong, the energy in the air turned cold, biting him slightly, but  just as soon as it happened, he felt the cold draw away from him and  into the orb held tightly in his opponent's hands. He panicked as he  heard the cry, and tried to brace himself for this attack, as he knew  that worse than anything else was a cornered and wounded animal, and  Ranma shared currently the feral look of a hunting cat.<p>"Retsu-hi!"  Gathered chi in one hand he drew back his fist, waiting for the  swirling ovoid death to come within range. There. He threw out his  arm with a corkscrew punch, and his fist struck the sickly colored ki  blast. The blast seemed to halt at that, as the cold chi enveloped  the hot internal energies and stripped them, the blast heating up,  and with it, pulling that last bits of the fanged berserker's attack  with it, rocketing quickly toward the originator of the first.</p><p>The hastily conceived plan  succeeded, and the blast flew true, rocketing into Ryoga with the  power of both his and Ranma's blasts, the ground beneath him,  exploding as well, sending bits of shrapnel into the air, and more  importantly, into the bandana-clad boy. Ranma was tired, and damn  near spent from his tiring day, a fight with each of his rivals, and  a not-so-brisk run through the district due to a misunderstanding.  His last enemy defeated he sagged to the ground, exhausted. He would  return home when he had recovered enough wind to walk, he thought,  well he was wrong. As he lay there bleeding, with closed eyes, he  heard a sound that heralded pain.</p><p>"Ranma! Stop picking on  Ryoga!" He felt the air part beneath the mallet's head, and then  the sharp pain, and taste of copper in his mouth as he bit into his  lip, then nothingness, sweet nothingness.</p>Dreams: They are the  revitalizing part of our sleep, allowing our mind to catch up to us.  Some even see them as glimpses into either the future, or even  perhaps, into other worlds. Ranma's were no different, except that  they afforded him no respite from the agonizing life he lived. He  watched the surrealness of his unconsciousness turned to dreams, and  later from dreaming into seeing. He had awakened some time the next day  he figured, as the painful brightness of the sun came down through  his window. A few extra bruises had been added to those he gained  from the day before. He lay there on the futon for what must have  been hours, he couldn't truly tell, his body had shut down so he  could heal himself in preparation for the next time he would sleep,  and thus was unable to move. He stewed in his own thoughts as the  muscle and bone returned to normal. Mind that the bandages around him  suggested Tofu, and he could only thank the doctor silently as his  body was healing correctly. Sometime though, as the sun was setting,  he slipped back into the land of dreams, one he would not remember.<p>Later that night, a  figure stood in the doorway to the Tendo's guest room. She was quite  obviously a she, despite her deep black cloak, sighed longingly as  she looked down on the peaceful martial artist, who she could tell  from the increasing ki flow through his form, was truly who she  suspected. Discarding that train of thought, she walked over to him,  and placed quickly beside him a small device, and a note, she hoped  that this small gift would help him unleash his true potential. She  slipped out the same way she had come, down through the house and out  the kitchen door. Going unnoticed by the sleeping family.</p><p><i>"I can't go on living  this way." </i>Ranma thought to himself  as the morning brought forth a whole new trial. Ranma awoke before  his father, still stiff from his injuries, but with a bit of exercise  he'd loosen up. Laying still for a moment allowed his body to settle  slightly, the stiffness dulling. He rolled to his side and arched an  eyebrow, seeing a small device laid right next to him. He then  noticed the card that sat atop it, his name written in beautiful  calligraphic letters.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>'Dear Ranma,<p>I have been watching your  trials since before your battle with the Phoenix,</p><p>during the times ahead the  music on this device will help you greatly in finding your</p><p>focus. Call out the name  of your opponent and a suitable playlist will activate on the</p><p>device, the battery will  recharge itself if shut off for 3 hours. In case you were worried</p><p>the case is waterproof and  made of a special alloy. Nothing short of another battle with</p><p>the phoenix Saffron will  destroy it, so there is no reason to worry about waters'</p><p>particularly strange  attraction to you, or your unique tendency to find trouble.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>A Friend'</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>He read it and gave the  idea a thought. Pops always did say that to fight well one must  have a rhythm. His smirk turned into a mischievous grin as he  stuffed the small device into his roll of clothes. Can't let pop  get a hold of this. He gathered up the roll of clothing and  headed for the bath. He scrubbed off, shivering slightly as the cold  water caused a tingle, and the odd sensation of turning into a  female. He strode silently to the furo, and climbed in, feeling the  same tingle, signifying his return to the gender of his birth.  Resting in the furo he found time to think about the previous day.<p>Everyone and his grandfather who could possibly have a problem with  Ranma had managed to find him, everyone. Though most weren't much  challenge, the few who were really taxed his energy, and when it came  down to Ryoga he knew he shouldn't have won, but he did. Shaking his  head he stood up and dried off, there was no time for such thoughts.  He dressed quickly and went downstairs, remembering to tuck the  device into his pockets and place the earphones into his ears, he'd  give this a try, maybe he could even manage to incorporate music,  another of his life's loves into his fighting style.</p><p>Breakfast was its usual  thing, Nabiki grumbling something about the sun, Kasumi humming  softly to herself, unknowing brightening the pigtailed boy's morning  along with her song, Tendo-san buried behind a newspaper, only the  clicking of his chopsticks to attest to his eat. The panda trying  desperately to steal his breakfast and failing in its attempts. Akane  shot murderous glances at her unwanted fiancée. Like  previously mentioned, the breakfast was for the most-part silent,  also as usual the meal remained uneventful. Until the inevitably  mumbled.</p><p>"Uncute tomboy." Grumbled as Ranma's thoughts were  expressed under his breath as he ate, Akane's eye twitched violently  as her anger began to visibly roll off her in waves.</p><p>"Jerk!"  Her words were very loudly punctuated by a devastating, glowing  mallet.</p><p>Ranma soared through the  air, only annoyed by the blow, sure it would be fatal, at least, to a  normal person, and as everyone in Nerima knew, you could not  truthfully associate Saotome Ranma and normal. He began to worry  about how things were progressing as he flew through the air, his  ascent not yet complete, and every day the challengers, fiancées,  and otherwise deranged martial artists were increasing in number.</p><p>Even now, a year after the disaster that was known now only as the  "wedding incident" things hadn't seemed to calm, in fact  they were steadily getting worse. He felt himself reach the peak of  his ascent, and returned his thoughts to more pressing matters,  avoiding Rapid Deceleration Syndrome. With expertise born of much  practice he began to angle his descent, spreading his limbs to slow  himself as much as possible. As he looked down from his position he  noticed that at least he wouldn't be late for school.</p><p>He smiled bitterly at  that thought, school, the place he hated most, (well it was only  slightly worse than home, after all, at home he didn't have to deal  with the Blue Blunder) had become his only refuge, the only place  where he could sleep undisturbed. He landed nimbly, not even kicking  up dust as he flared his ki at the last moment beneath him, slowing  himself dramatically. On the upside to all this, he had become far  stronger, all the challenges and fights, and general narrow escapes  from death had increased his ki reserves, as well as strength and  endurance, which all mixed well with his impressive speed.</p><p>Being as Kuno had yet to  appear he counted his blessings...</p><p>"Halt! Foul  sorcerer, prepare to release the beauteous Akane and virtuous  Pigtailed Girl from thy base debauchery. I will smite thee. That the  fair maidens will be free to shower my righteous self with the  affections a being of my noble birth doth deserve." Apparently  he had started counting too soon. He grinned, deciding that since he  was early he would try out this music thingy that the "friend"  sent him. Kuno ranting away as he reached into his pocket and pressed  the power button hearing the thing come to life with a dull hum from  the earphones. He adjusted calmly the wireless earpieces that coiled  around his ear as if they had been made to fit only him. He slid into  a neutral and called out one word.</p><p>"... With this blade  I will fell you vile magician, be ye cast back into the abyss from  whence ye came." Kuno called out charging our pigtailed hero,  his katana glowing orange. He was halfway at Ranma when the pigtailed  martial artist said something he couldn't hear.</p><p>"Kuno." Music  began pouring into his head, and then Kuno's blade fell, and just as  suddenly Ranma was, well, not there. He had leapt back, rebounding  off the wall, and unsurprisingly to the few students there, it  collapsed under the enormous air pressure from Kuno's strike. He  smirked, Kuno had gotten much better since the failed wedding, much  better, almost a challenge. He smirked, this song was great, energy  poured into every cell of his being. He understood, the music, it  brought a sort of clarity that he'd never imagined.</p><p>"Alright Kuno, this  time it's for keeps." Ranma said, his aura flaring about him,  and than shrunk back into him, until golden arcs of electricity  jumped randomly across his glowing form. His actions shocked a few of  the students with his display of power that wasn't considered by the  general populace to be Ranma's style. Some started placing the last  bets before the Ice Queen's factors closed the pools, their sempai  watching things from her usual window, apparently having come to  school just after Ranma had been air-mailed here.</p><p>Kuno smirked in a way  only a delusional Shakespearian reject could.</p><p>"I shall see thyne  end demon!" With that declaration he charged, bringing the  glowing sword in a slash from an upper attitude, only to miss as  Ranma dodged by inches, and raised a single hand as swayed back into  an upright position to slap the idiot's blade outward with his middle  and index fingers, widening the holes in Kuno's guard enough for him  to drive a truck through. Ranma slid his arm down the flat of the  blade, keeping the fools guard open for the few more seconds  necessary to slap Kuno across the face.</p><p>The shock from the outright  insult to his skill gave the pigtailed fighter enough time to bury  what looked to be one slow punch to the gut, but the trained eyes of  the crowd saw how Kuno expelled breath more than a few times, telling  of a number of rabbit punches. Kuno bent slightly, his eyes bugged  out and he slumped to his knees groaning in pain. The indication that  something was wrong only came to Ranma when Kuno suddenly leapt up  and forward, his voice booming over even his music.</p><p>"Tenmou!"  The kendoist's blade rolled in his hand, switching it quickly to a  reverse grip as he leapt forward toward the Saotome heir, and  followed up with another switched grip, falling toward his foe that  was in mid dodge. The next blow sent the orange hue surrounding his  blade outward, a blade of ki hurtling toward Ranma.</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened as  he saw the blade coming, he knew he wouldn't escape without pain, but  he could lessen the damage. He jumped back, and winced as he felt the  blade climb up his chest, ruining his shirt with both the rip and the  line of blood that would seep into the silken garment. He was leaping  back when he saw the second half of Kuno's technique, Nice form.  He thought to himself as he watched the orange glow rip away from the  blade sliding through the air toward him. Humph, loser. He  snorted as he gathered some energy and crossed his arms. The blade of  ki reached him and exploded against his arms and sent him flying  backward from the shockwave.</p><p>He landed in a modified jinga, his  stance shifting in a swaying motion his feet only swaying minorly,  and his annoyance with Kuno rising steadily. He finally noticed that  this fight had reduced his shirt to nothingness, his mind drifting  momentarily toward Kasumi, who had spent hours fixing this shirt,  maintaining it because she knew it was his favorite. He snapped then  his mind lulled into harmony with the fight, his cold rage taking  over, his form kept swaying slightly with the beat, flowing back and  forth as the demented swordsman charged him. His rocking motion  immediately became something serious as he started dodging the rapid  fire sword thrusts. He ducked, dodged, flipped and at some points he  even parried the blows, smiling evilly all the way, the song echoing  throughout his mind.</p>As the song reached its  peak his normally cocky grin faded, replaced by a more feral smirk.  "Time to end this." His pace increased and he blurred from  sight long enough for several loud crashes to be heard as Kuno was  thrown around by something none of the other students could see. From  a third floor window Nabiki looked on with not a little bit of  confusion, not that it could show mind you. He looks like he's  moving in the Amaguriken, except, his whole body is moving that  fast. Little did any of the others know that her thoughts were  reflected by the ones Cologne was having at that very moment,  standing as she was atop a building across the street. Son-in-law is  much stronger than he has been letting on, he must be brought into  the tribe at any cost.<p>"Nothing's  al-right!" Ranma yelled, going with the flow of the song as it  ended, the song ended and Kuno was laid out, and in a strangely  contorted heap.</p><p>"Sleep mode." He smirked as he continued on  into the school, catching the article of clothing in one hand over  his head. He looked up to see a nodding Nabiki looking down on him  before turning back into the school.</p><p>A figure stood atop the  school, shadowed by the clock.</p><p>"He is almost ready, soon, very  soon." With that the figure disappeared into the shadows once  again.</p><p>To Be Continued…</p><p style="text-align:center;">Techniques  Translation:</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Retsu-hi: </b>It  means Cold fire.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Tenmou:</b> It  means Divine Judgment</p>
