</div><p><b>Dark  Prayer</b></p><p>By:  XZero</p><p>Disclaimer:  Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi, not me.</p><p>Great  thanx to Paul, who without, I'd not have been able to give to you my  best.</p><p><b>Chapter  4- Numb</b></p><p>Only  a week had passed since the fateful day that Ranma had been given his  second "gift". The pendant seemed ancient, the ambient ki  the martial artist felt from it was strangely familiar, almost  scarily so. It felt so close to the energy he remembered using  against Saffron. He could feel it twirling around in his passive  aura, floating within it, connecting and building in it.</p><p>Today  found him training in the Tendo dojo, a kata forming in his  movements, echoing his thoughts closely. As he went the pattern began  to get erratic, short bursts of angry red escaping and sending him  through a blur of motion, ending quickly as he resumed less provoking  thoughts. He pondered that battle with the Phoenix King for seemingly  the millionth time, the situation striking him as familiar. Something  about the power he felt, about the situation itself, facing  unimaginable odds, and emerging victorious through sheer  determination and skill. He shrugged that feeling off, pushing it  back as he re-examined the battle. Best to let that train of thought  reveal itself in time, he figured.</p><p>Saffron  had pushed him to his limits and beyond, and had almost broken him.  But Saffron had made a fatal mistake. The pigtailed fighter could  only smile sourly every time he remembered that detail of the combat.</p><p>"Fatal,  yeah, great one Re... Ranma," he grumbled, not catching the  slip. Saffron had toyed with him initially, even Ranma remembered  that clearly, and there in was his mistake. Playing with an opponent  would give them time to prepare for you; they'd get a chance to  adapt. It was a lesson Ranma now understood, and realize that  continuing to do so against his opponents would cause him to fall  similarly.</p><p>Newer,  more intense training had become necessary, his kata were maintained  at top speed, forcing him to learn greater accuracy and increase his  endurance. Weighting his clothing until it could bear no more weight  to increase his strength and endurance even further, having the side  effect of greater speed. His training was brutal, and throughout it  the only ones to realize it were the ones stuck in the background,  his only solace came from a homemaker and a mercenary. He struggled  for his increasing strengths, his focus had relied on his skill,  until realizing that every major battle he'd fought included some  special aspect, Saffron had his flames and regenerative capabilities,  while Herb had his immense ki stores.</p><p>Kirin had incredible speed and  accuracy, Ryouga; his long lasting rival had endurance and strength  to rival the kami. Mousse could produce and use any weapon he found,  and improvised ones as well. When he had realized that he began  devising these methods, and now his bracers weighed almost as much as  Ryouga's umbrella, something not even Akane with her guerilla  strength could wield, even with two hands. He fought constantly to  maintain the intensity he'd reached. To keep others from noticing,  he'd increase his weight load and strain to keep him fast enough to  dodge Ryouga's blows which would leave him just about where the  other's would assume he was.</p><p>He snapped back to reality as he  misjudged a rebound due to lack of concentration, his reminiscing  ended by a harsh trip to the floor. He stood wearily from this,  pulling power back into his body, feeling his energies return as he  gathered his energy and began again. He'd master this, fear of losing  control driving him forward with his patented determination. He went  on despite his pain because pain was a friend that Ranma was used  too. Since receiving his first gift he had stepped up his training,  increasing the weight and strain on his ki, hoping to control this  new power growing within, or rather, opening to his awareness, as if  it had always been there, but only recently available.</p><p>Only a few  days had passed, but Ranma felt himself begin to reign in the amazing  power that he'd found in the music. It was a slow process  nonetheless, but he would not fail. The small part of his mind left  to wonder about such things tried to figure out where his amazing new  abilities were coming from. He shuddered as one possibility popped to  mind. Surely it wasn't the excess power that was caused by the  neko-ken. He quickly discarded that dark thought.</p><p>He  felt that this power was older, and looking back, he could remember  using it, even before the Saffron incident, as far back as when he  was a child, though not many memories remained of that time. A good  deal of his past had been locked away, part of the dark legacy of the  cat fist.</p><p>He  stopped at the end of a particularly difficult kata and sat down,  dripping sweat from his long workout. He began to sift through the  past, images of fighting, running, and anger. He could see all the  things that he'd done 'in the name of the art' and he felt sick at  what he saw. He needed to end this, and it would end soon, he swore  it to himself silently. Feeling the thought process come to a close  he lifted his eyelids and noticed the brilliant silver glow  surrounding him. He wanted to feel the sun, to let his muscles enjoy  its warmth instead of the strain he had been placing them under.  Hefting his incredibly heavy shirt over his shoulder, he headed  towards the door.</p><p>The  sun had just begun its blazing journey across this day's sky and with  it, the eldest Tendo girl had risen stepping out into the cool air of  the morning. He found himself paralyzed watching the eldest daughter  with a strange look in his eye. Kasumi, why haven't I noticed  before, she was such a pure and simple seeming woman, and indeed  she was a woman, disguised as it was by her modest clothing and tidy  apron. He could do nothing but marvel at something he had previously  overlooked, maybe it was an epiphany, maybe he'd grown up a little,  he didn't know, and neither does the author.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi  was by nature an early riser; she had trained herself to be. She  needed to be, for if she was to do all the chores around the house,  except for those that Ranma had undertaken some months ago, than she  would need very greatly the time and quiet of the morning to get the  majority of the housework done, to give her ample time to construct  dinner. Currently she was hanging the wash that she'd done the night  before, particularly a load of sheets. The breeze was getting  steadily stronger, and the hazy fog that clung to the ground was not  a good indicator for it clearing up any time soon.<p>A sudden and  strong gust of wind pulled the ribbon she used to tie her ponytail  free, tearing the sheet in her hands away from her as she  instinctively raised her hands to grasp at the string. She  immediately began to chase after the sheet, hoping to keep it from  getting dirty again. The fog was detrimental to this cause, however,  and just as soon as she was chasing the sheet, she wished dearly that  she'd not. The eldest Tendo daughter felt her foot collide with  something, and than felt herself tumble forward, she prepared herself  for the assuredly painful collision with the ground, screwing her  eyes shut.</p><p>The  pain never came; instead she felt the warmth of someone else's body.  Not opening her eyes she reached up toward her savior and felt around  for their face. Her hands danced across a flat chest that was bare,   Male, well defined... her hands went upward, ...light  amounts of hair on the chin and face She screamed out as she felt  the rush of air and the lack of gravity momentarily, still in the  arms of her rescuer. Finally her hands found what she had been  looking for, ...a pigtail? Her mind whirled and ground to a  halt as she opened her eyes quickly as she looked into the soulful  blue-grays of her handsome hero,</p><p>"Ranma?" She questioned  softly, eyes widening as she made the connection, and felt gravity  reapply.</p><p>Ranma  hadn't realized what he was doing until he had reached the edge of  the koi pond and had Kasumi lifted into his arms, she'd been about to  hit her head really hard, but he'd fixed that, sliding beneath her  fall with more speed than even he realized he bounded upward, halting  his forward momentum with flair only the heir to the Anything Goes  could manage. He had felt her hand roaming over his chest and to his  face, but at the end he looked down into Kasumi's opening eyes and  smiled, knowing he'd done well. "Ranma?" He nodded slightly  as they neared the ground, and with ease born of practice,  concentrated his energy and slowed as he was touching down, that's  when he heard the other scream, and it was indeed one that pissed him  off.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane  had risen this early for her morning jog, something she'd done for  the last several years. Each morning she'd dress in some sweat  clothes and go out, jogging for 2 miles and return. She'd just  finished dressing and was closing her bedroom door when she heard her  eldest sister scream out in fear, abandoning reason, which she seemed  to be infamous for doing, she dashed for the door, leaping down the  stairs, and skidding to a halt at the door to the backyard when she  stopped and saw something horrifying, Ranma was up in the air,  holding Kasumi to him, her hair loose and flapping in the cool wind.  Rage built within her, that pervert must have grabbed Kasumi! Akane's  strange mindset allowed her to come to the odd conclusion that he had  grabbed Kasumi in an attempt to take advantage of her and in her  struggles her hair came undone, she must have screamed because she  wanted her sister to save her, because she knew that her younger  sister was the best martial artist around.<p>"Ranma no Baka!"  She yelled as she hefted a war hammer and charged the young fighter,  heedless of the fact that Kasumi was cradled in his arms. She brought  the hammer to bear and started with the down stroke, this would teach  the baka hentai.</p><p>"Shikyo  Hana!" Ranma flared in a blue corona of power that encased him  and his passenger. Akane's mallet construct had only exploded back  at her from her attempt to brain the Saotome heir, protected by his  defensive aura. His features twisted into a snarl that seemed so  unlike him in Kasumi's opinion as she felt herself being set down  from the comfort of his solid warm embrace.</p><p>"Fool!"  Ranma raged, setting Kasumi gently down, making sure she could stand  on her own before returning his attention to the tomboy. Ranma's eyes  narrowed, a snarl indicating the rage which was becoming visible on  his features.</p><p>"You disgusting whelp, you'd put your own sister  in danger to wrongfully attack me?" Everyone peered out their  windows, awakened by the explosion and nightmarish feeling emanating  from the enraged Ranma. Their fears were solidified as a corona of  blue fire radiated from a shadowed form whom even Nabiki, untrained  as she was, could tell to be Ranma standing on the lawn. They could  hear the crackle of the energy racing all around him, arcing off of  him to strike the ground as lightning, not at all like his usual  spread aura. This aura bloomed upward like a bonfire, swirling in  deadly beauty which threatening to engulf them all. For a minute  Nabiki considered grabbing a fire extinguisher, but noticed the blue  ki-flames didn't seem to be consuming him, rather that it was him.  Soun and Genma stared out, both afraid to do anything and afraid to  not do something. They decided, in a moment only to be described as  an epiphany, to let it play out as it would. After all, how would two  aging martial artists who hid from a gnome stand against a walking  bonfire of ki-flame?</p><p>"If  you wish a fight with someone worthy of your skill, go pick a fight  with kitten." He smirked and turned away from Ms. Martial  Artist, to Kasumi, who had lost her footing on the slick grass as she  backed away from what she thought, would be another fight.</p><p>"Are  you okay?" He asked softly, the fire around him receding into  his form. Kasumi could only nod dumbly as he helped her up, knowing  that once again this young man had managed to break her mask with his  displays of skill.</p><p>Akane  twitched in anger, her rage had built immensely, not only was the  jerk showing off, but he had done the unspeakable. He'd ignored her,  treated her as if she weren't worth his time, and was flirting with  her sister, paying attention to someone else.</p><p>I'll  show that jerk not to take me lightly. She swore internally as  she growled and charged him again, hefting a similar war hammer to  the one before. She aimed her weapon to strike toward Ranma's head,  since when had he been able to dodge her before anyways? She mused,  as the judgment of heaven was brought downward.</p><p>The  pigtailed fighter felt the energy buildup, the blue fire sprung to  life once more. He turned his head so that he was facing her.</p><p>"If  you feel you wish to die, than prepare yourself for hell." His  aura suddenly pulled back into his form. With a neutral expression,  he called out.</p><p>"Munashii Zenkai".</p><p>The  human eye can only track so fast. No one noticed him move, no one was  strong enough to follow him. Akane's blind charge continued until she  suddenly stopped just inches from striking Kasumi with her two-handed  swing. Ranma appeared near the house, his back turned to the  situation, his undershirt reduced to small strips of cloth and his  pants in tatters, barely letting him retain his modesty, and managing  to leave only his necklace unscathed.</p><p>"Three...two...one."  The Anything Goes heir stated calmly. Upon the count of one Akane  flew backward, and stopped in the air, her body contorting in odd  positions as she was pummeled by what seemed to be a ghost. Just as  quickly as the brutal phantom started its assault, the entire thing  ended with Akane lying in a heap of ruined clothing, and a  humiliating number of bruises that spelled out a large variety of  embarrassing things about the youngest Tendo.</p><p>The  idiot's two were about to start on their rants but couldn't find the  words, they couldn't muster themselves to argue against the obvious,  even they could learn, and today they indeed learned that Ranma could  no longer be manipulated.</p><p>Nabiki  learned this same lessen and to herself thought Thank goodness  Ranma, I never thought you'd grow up enough and get over those silly  ideas your father put into you. She knew that she'd alienated the  pigtailed man, but even more she knew that she'd done something that  she'd be proud of, she helped Ranma to escape his prison of false  honor, she'd shone him the realities of the world and now he'd deal  with it in his own way.</p><p>Kasumi  stared at the sight before, She'd known of Akane's violent  tendencies, just never thought that she'd let her anger allow her to  be so blinded that she'd hurt her family or an innocent bystander.  She was ashamed that she'd allowed this to go on, and horrendously  angry at her father who'd never done a thing as Akane's sensei to  correct this mistake. What about Ranma finally fighting back? No  one here is used to a warrior, who has sworn to protect. No longer to  be compared to a Martial Artist who learns only to improve their  skills. She thought solemnly to herself as she watched the goings on.</p><p>The  martial artist who was known as 'god slayer' to the Amazons, Musk,  and Phoenix people alike stood tall, his angry expression visible and  plain, He looked around letting himself relax, redoubling the grasp  of his internal energies after that instant, before turning to  Kasumi.</p><p>"Kasumi,  go get my mother, and take Nabiki with you, things are about to get  messy." He stated simply as he adjusted the belt her wore, and  removed his undershirt entirely, not that pulling the ribbons of  fabric off of him was any mean feat. Next he tossed the heavy tunic  toward the compound wall, a small crater forming in the dirt from its  landing. He just turned around calmly, and waited for the expected  disaster, not giving any indication of what he'd meant.</p><p>Kasumi,  nodded simply, trusting enough in the pigtailed guardian to follow  his instructions without question. She and ran into the house,  amazingly quickly despite her lack of training.</p><p>"Nabiki, please  come with me, we need to go get Aunty." She called out as she  put on her shoes and removed her apron. Nabiki was downstairs  quickly, moving with a speed she'd never displayed before. The two  sisters rushed out of the house and out of the gate, quickly heading  toward the house in Nerima that Nodoka had bought, afraid that  wasting any time would cause something bad to happen.</p><p>Nodoka  Saotome had always found joy in gardening, and spent at least an hour  in her garden every day in the mornings, before she headed out to do  whatever it was she needed to do. She was currently pulling the weeds  that had sprouted in her roses (Not sure if anyone can really afford  to let these grow in Japan considering the cost of land) at least  until she heard the front gate opening. She stood and brushed the  dirt from her work pants, kimonos weren't suited for the labor  involved with her gardening, finished with this she went around front  to the front door, where she saw the two elder Tendo sisters knocking  frantically.</p><p>"Can  I help you dears?" she asked, wondering why they would come.  Nabiki and Kasumi whirled around, and in short order came to tell  Nodoka what was going on at the Tendo house.</p><p>"No... It couldn't  be, then, this changes things entirely, and we must hurry. If he's  used the Void Armageddon, then there is no time to spare." She  said sagely, but the other two women could not understand what  connection Ranma's mother had with his behavior as of late. Worry was  desperately obvious in her features. Kasumi could not help but to  sadly nod her head.</p><p>"Yes  aunty, but what does this have to do with Ranma's warning, or that he  is acting strangely?" Still wondering why this was going on.</p><p>Nodoka  didn't answer; she just rushed into her home, and upstairs.</p><p>"What  was that all about?" Nabiki wondered aloud, walking into the  house to wait for the older woman to return. She looked around the  living room area of the home, it was nicely, however sparse,  furnished. Kasumi, in the meanwhile, was doing the same, noticing  that several things in the room were odd, such as a pair of bracers  and a katana that were displayed on a mantle above what appeared to  be several musical instruments. Then something that she deemed as  strange occurred to her, these instruments were not only mostly  western, but they and the bracers and blade all shared a common  feature, the same yang symbol on all of them could be found on  Ranma's new necklace. But he'd said that he had found it,  unconvincingly of course, but all the same that is what he'd said.</p><p>"Come  on girls, we'd better go." She collected the bracers and sword  from the wall, and ran out the door, followed by Nabiki, and then  Kasumi, who closed the door behind her. How could this be  happening, grandfather couldn't have been right about Ranma, could  he? No, it's just a legend and it has nothing to do with my son. But  if it is true, will I be able to say goodbye to my little boy again?  But her thoughts were drowned out as they saw the Tendo Dojo in the  distance, sounds of combat emanating from the property, and...</p><p>...then  the explosion.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Earlier</i><p>Ranma  watched as Kasumi and Nabiki left, and felt as the others were  arriving.</p><p>"Grand Finale" He spoke, and the music started  up, this time with another song by the American band, Linkin Park. He  felt let go of his restraints once more. Feeling the energy surround  him, he looked towards the usual suspects as they approached?</p><p>"Saotome  prepare to die!" Pig-boy and Duck-boy</p><p>"Airen,  time to be proper groom." Shampoo</p><p>"Ranma,  honey, you better start acting like a husband should."   Ugh...Ukyo</p><p>"Time  to go back to China Son-in-law." The old ghoul</p><p>"Ranma,  m'boy, how about you comfort an old man?" The old freak</p><p>"Die  foul sorcerer Kuno</p><p>"Ranma  darling, it is time you got rid of these base court hussies and  declared your love for me." Psycho-bitch</p><p>The  two masters of the anything-goes disappeared from his senses, hiding  most likely, Ranma thought, he knew they'd show up once they thought  he was off guard, it was without doubt.</p><p>He  was sure that this collection of freaks, weirdoes, and all around  martial artists were the only ones needed for the final act.</p><p>"You  have all long wanted me for your own devices, defeat me now and I'll  grant your wish." Ranma looked each of them with years of  emotions finally released.</p><p>"This shall now be the final act,  those who are defeated will never trouble me again, for I have no  desire for any of your deaths, and that is assuredly the outcome of  persisting in this fruitless endeavor." This was beginning to  scare the fiancées; Ranma would never hurt them, would he? No,  he was just kidding about that part, right? They were unsure, but  they would beat him, if it meant that'd make him theirs...</p><p>This  entire scene was taken in by the cloaked woman, her only feature  visible the broad smile on her lips, Finally, he's done it,  unlocked the final key. Soon Reiko, soon we'll be together again, and  I won't be alone ever again.</p><p>TBC...</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Techniques  Translation:</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Shikyo  Hana</b>: While the name resembles the move by Iori Yagami from SNK's  King of Fighters, this move is completely different, the user summons  up their battle aura and focuses it into an attack, basically it is  an aura flare, if you want a mental picture, think about the power up  effect DBZ characters have on the ground, that's basically what it  does, push things away very forcefully, it also has the effect that a  ki blast has on other things charged with ki. Anyway, it means Death  Blossom</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Munashii  Zenkai</b>: This move is basically the ultimate Amaguriken style  move, while the Amaguriken involves just punches, this floods the  user's body with ki, making them effectively move entirely at  Amaguriken speeds, of course, this increases in difficulty and speed  the more energy one puts into it.</p><p>I'd  like to preemptively address the marks left on Akane by Ranma, in the  beginning of the series he does the same to Kuno with one touch,  which Kuno never felt. So imagine a year after he faces off against  and kills a god, it isn't hard to imagine him doing unholy  amounts of damage, or instead leaving her unconscious with her body  covered in insults with moderate damage.</p>
