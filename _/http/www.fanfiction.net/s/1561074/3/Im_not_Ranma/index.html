</div>I'm not Ranma!<p>-=Chapter 01b=-<p>"I.. I'm Ranma Saotome, sorry about this." Ranko said before looking away with a blush.<p>Nabiki could barely stop herself from yelling out "He's mine!" but the shy and slightly flushed look of the boy had told her she might scare him off. She looked over as Akane who seemed slightly startled by Ranko, no dought expecting some sort of grammatically challenged jock.<p>"Oh, no need to be sorry, come this way." Kasumi said sweetly taking Ranko by the wrist and dragging her into the dining room, Nabiki grinned at the bewildered cry he gave off from the suddenness of Kasumi's actions. "Have a seat I'll return with tea."<p>Nabiki made sure to plant herself right across from Ranko, as Akane sat by her side, both admiring their guest.<p>"Don't stare too hard." Akane jumped as her sister nudged her in the ribs and brandished a grin. Akane growled at her, but stopped quickly after bring a curious eye from Ranko. She had been staring, at their guest?<p>"Here we are, Ranma?" Kasumi held out cup of tea which slipped before it could reach Ranko's fingers. She gasped as it fell, but didn't have a chance to continue as Ranko caught it as it tumbled threw the air, up- righting it and not spilling a drop.<p>"Thank you." Ranko looked down from the astonished stares and sipped some tea. She wasn't used to this sort of attention, if someone wasn't throwing a punch at her, she really didn't know how to react.<p>Kasumi seemed the first to recover as she set out the rest of the tea, before sitting on the other side of her middle sister. After a short pause Kasumi spoke<p>"I'm Kasumi Tendo, and theses are my younger sisters, Nabiki, and Akane. We are very pleased to have you as out guest." Ranko shank a bit and sipped at her tea, why the heck did her pop have to wander off and leave her here. "Pleased to meet you."<p>"Hey where did you learn that?" Akane broke in, still slightly amazed by the cups rescue.<p>"The cup?" Ranko blinked.<p>"Yes, how did you catch it so quickly?" Nabiki added leaning forward on her elbows in interest.<p>Ranko perked up a bit, and seemed to brighten. Now she was on some even ground. "Well me and pops where passing threw this old monastery, in who knows where. When we discovered the monks had this technique of grabbing snakes in mid strike. Apparently they have a lot of snake problems there. Well pop owed them some money, I helped work it off by removing some of the snakes they had slithering around."<p>"Oh my!" Kasumi gasped. "You weren't bitten where you?"<p>"Well, a few dozen times, till I got the hang of it."<p>"A few dozen?" Nabiki sounded skeptical.<p>Ranko removed her right arm guard showing of quite a few faded wounds, obviously snake bites. "They'll disappear in week or so." She explained as Kasumi took a hold of her arm and examined it closely, the other two sisters also crowding near for a look.<p>"Um, may I have my arm back?" Ranko asked growing nerves after a few minuets of being examined.<p>"Theses must have bled a lot" Kasumi said in concern.<p>"Well, after the first bite, I sort of had to let um bleed." The sisters looked up confused. "They where poisons." Ranko shrugged, then retracted her arm to replace the armguard.<p>"Then why did you do it?" Akane asked perplexed.<p>"Pop's owed them money." Ranko shrugged and went back to her tea, starting to feel nervous again.<p>"Then why didn't your father do it?" Nabiki asked with a stern face.<p>Ranko fidgeted a bit.<p>"Well?" Nabiki insisted.<p>"Nabiki maybe he don't want to answer." Akane broke in with a bit of concern; seeing how nervous Ranko was getting.<p>"Well if his father owed the money why was Ranma here stuck doing the dirty work? I want to know." Nabiki said with a bit of edge in her voice.<p>"Nabiki." Kasumi tested, but stopped as Ranko spoke.<p>"Pop's." Ranko looked down as if she had just been told her puppy had died. "Pops was half a mile away by the time they knew he left. The monks where angry and forced me to remove the snake problem as punishment, for my fathers debts. A week later when I met up with him he had claimed, it was all part of the training." Ranko seemed tremble a bit withheld emotion but showed no sign of letting it out.<p>"Oh my." Was all Kasumi could manage.<p>Nabiki was staring at Ranko with an angered scow, not for her but for her father.<p>Akane seemed to be in a similar state as Ranko. Feeling a slight bit of pity for a boy wasn't normal for her, but she would make an exception, till he proved he was a pervert. All boys where perverts after all.<p>Ranko felt a bit knotted up inside and decided to change the subject. She didn't like thinking about her trip much. "So, do you know why pops was so insistent on visiting here?" She asked softly, and was rewarded with the tree sisters blinking in unison.<p>"You mean you don't know why you're here?" Nabiki asked, her anger dissipated, the same for her sisters as they all wore a confused look.<p>Ranko shook her head.<p>"Well" Kasumi blushed faintly, and then continued to tell Ranko about the arranged marriage. After she was finished, the room was dowsed in silence.<p>Ranko blinked, she blinked again. She opened her mouth a bit, then shut it, with a unbelieving face. "M.. marriage!" She asked, setting her face back to normal.<p>Kasumi nodded.<p>"I think he took it well." Nabiki whispered amusidely for her sisters top hear.<p>"Pops!" Ranko yelled at the top of her lungs, "Get your ass in here, now!" as she jumped to her feet startling the three sisters.<p>"Ranma what is it?" Came the aggravated voice of her father as he entered the room with his pal Soun. "Your not starting trouble are you?"<p>"You never told me about no arranged marriage on our way here." She growled low and dangerously.<p>Genma seemed taken aback and started to sweat profusely. "Um, yes about that. You see it was arranged before your birth and, it sort of slipped my mind. It has been awhile since then!" Genma started to laugh loudly, as he sweated.<p>"There is no way I'm marring any of them!" Ranko shouted snapping her father out of his nervousness, as he stomped up to her by the opening into the yard.<p>"Hey what's wrong with us!" Akane shouted as her temper rose, and to think she was pitting him only a moment ago.<p>"Now you see here boy! This was arranged before you where born and your going to follow threw with it!" Genma commanded towering over his son.<p>"Akane stay out of this!" Ranko growled, casing the 3 sisters to gasp at the anger plastered on Ranko's face. He no longer looked cute to them; now he looked like a raging inferno of power and strength, now he looked extremely hot with his hair seeming to flap around from some unseen wind, and his body tense ready for an attack.<p>"I aint following threw with nothing you set up old man!" Ranko spat glaring up at her father.<p>Nabiki felt her heart skip a beat; she had thought this Ranma was nothing but a pretty boy with some skills. But now seeing the fire he had inside, she could not suppress the hungry look that over took her face. This Ranma, maybe he would bring some life to this boring town, that is if he where to stay.<p>"It not a choice boy! You will do as I say!" Genma losing control, threw a punch at his son, who dodged it easily.<p>"I aint listening to you old man!" Ranko yelled as she jumped back and went for a low roundhouse, which was easily evaded.<p>"I think its long over due for you to learn to respect your elders!" Genma cried as he sent a significantly faster punch at Ranko catching her in the abdomen and sending her flying into the backyard.<p>"Have to do better then that, pops!" Ranko cried out happily, landing easily, looking unaffected by the attack.<p>Genma charged her and delivered a combo of punches and kicks at blinding speed, but Ranko seemed to dodge them without care and returned her own.<p>"This whole thing stinks! Why the heck do I have to marry um anyway?" She growled as her kick caught her father in mid attack and sent him slamming into the barrier wall, cracking it slightly.<p>"Because its on your honor!" Genma barked and dove in for another attack. Slamming Ranko into the tree near the koi pond, causing it to shake madly.<p>Meanwhile the Tendo family stood on the walkway starring in shock.<p>"Father, was your friend always like this?" Kasumi asked worriedly as Genma was attempting to drown his son below a large rock in the pond.<p>"Oh yes!" Soun cried tears of happiness spraying in every direction. "It reminds me of the old days when me and Genma ran side by side with master! Always devising a new plan to rid ourselves of him. Oh how I miss thoughts days!"<p>"Wow, looks like you found one boy you shouldn't fight Akane." Nabiki whistled, impressed with the acrobatic display of marshal arts she was witnessing.<p>"He's not that good." Akane said miffed until Ranko got a decent hit in on his father, rocketing him nearly 20 feet into the barrier wall again. Akane tried to hide her unease, Nabiki just smirked as her.<p>"Do you think we sound stop them father?" Kasumi asked as the battle continued to move steadily towards her flower garden.<p>"Oh don't worry! They will tire themselves out shortly. Let's go inside and wait shawl we?" Soun herded his family in and shut the flimsy paper door that did little to filter out the sound of battle raging outside.<p>"Kasumi dear, could you start dinner? I'm sure they will be famished by the time they finish."<p>"Of course father" Kasumi beamed brightly, a little twitch at the corner of her lips as she heard the crash and shatter of one of her flower pots.<p>"Akane, Nabiki, sit down." Soun directed them to the table.<p>"Father?" Akane asked.<p>"So what do you two think of Ranma and his father?" Soun seemed so genuinely happy Akane decided not to go with what her first thoughts where to say. She was still angry at being snaped at by Ranko.<p>"Well, he seems. ok." Akane was looking for words.<p>"Nabiki?" Soun beamed.<p>"Well." Nabiki thought a moment. "I find his shy side a bit cute, but that this whole angry side is just so hot! And he's very skilled; it makes me wonder what else can do with his hands."<p>"Nabiki!" Akane yelled with a terrible blush.<p>"Kidding, sis, kidding." Nabiki played innocent. "Really sis you have to lighten up."<p>"It's settled then!" Soun smiled causing both his daughters to blink. "Nabiki you will be Ranma's fiancée."<p>"Hay wait don't I get a say in this!" Akane complained, causing Nabiki's eyebrow to rise.<p>"What, you want dibs on him too sis?" Akane started mouthing something then stammered.<p>"W..why would I want to marry him anyway! He's probably a pervert like all the rest."<p>"Never know till you ask." Nabiki smiled. "Well if you're not interested I'm more then willing to take him."<p>"Akane?" Soun asked, looking for an answer.<p>Akane tried to think of something to say, she didn't know why she was thinking about it at all. "Have him; I don't want a fiancée!" She barked angrily.<p>"Then it's final. Nabiki you will be Ranma's fiancée!" Soun stood up and left the room crying with happiness. "Oh happy days!" Akane flowing close behind, turned up the stairs towards her room, it was easy to see she was in a less then happy mood.<p>"Ranma Saotome" Nabiki spoke with a soft smile, as if pronouncing the name of some French whine of outstanding stature. She blinked when she heard some tortured cries filter threw the thin walls, and smiled realizing they belonged to Genma. If Ranma's father was anything like the impression she got from earlier, he disserved every hit he took. It made her wonder though.<p>For a moment when Ranma had told them about being forced to pay his fathers debts, it seemed as if it wasn't something new, something he was quite familiar with but ashamed to talk about. If she had to guess, she suspected that wasn't the first or the last time Ranma had to do such things. Not that she should jump to conclusions, she liked facts, and she was sure she would get them soon.<p>She stood and stretched before making her way to the stairs, then to her room where she would change into her usual clothing, all the while entertaining ways to best break the news of her engagement to the students of Furinkan high, and get the biggest reaction.
