</div>I'm not Ranma!<p>-=Chapter 01a=-<p>Ranma jumped from the rotten bamboo poll just as his father sliced it with a powerful chop. "Hey pops! This is a training ground not a destroy as you like ground!" Ranma yelled out barely dodging another overhand chop which again clobbered another defenseless poll.<p>"Boy, hold still and take your training like a man!" The bald overweight man yelled, showing no intent to stop his assault.<p>"Please honored sir's, you must not training there, very bad!"<p>"Hey! What you talking about?" Ranma called out missing his fathers next attack which inevitably sent him rocketing into a mercy pool. Genma stood atop his poll smirking triumphantly. "You getting weak on me boy!"<p>Ranma tried to scream in agony as his body burst into flames, tearing at his flesh. Franticly he kicked with his lags to escape the torturous pool but they did not respond, instead they give into the pain leaving him defenseless. But as quickly as it began it stopped. With a powerful kick he flew from the water gagging for air and, choking up some swallowed bits of weed.<p>"Pop what the hell you thinking, hitting me when my back is turned!" Ranma complained with a strangled voice as he jumped up to meet his father on the polls.<p>Genma stared confusedly at his son as he jumped to the poll before him. When did he dye his hair red? There was nowhere for his sun to get things such as dye around here, besides he didn't think his son would know what hair dye was. "Ranma I demand to know when you dyed your hair!"<p>"What the hell you talking about old man, it's always been this color." Ranma emphasized the point pulling his pigtail out showing it off its flaming color. "Don't play games with me boy!"<p>It was now Genma noticed his sons larger chest, the boy must be working out again, I'm goanna have to get back in shape soon. Maybe a demonstration would set his son back in line. "Boy time for round two!" He lunched himself forward at his son intent on a devastating haymaker.<p>Ranma reacted instantly as his father brought both his arms back for the attack. He launched forward at his fathers legs, and gave his ankle a strong kick throwing him off course and leaving his defense's wide open. "Getting slow old man!" Ducking below the close blow, he delivered a quick knee to the lower ribs and a powerful round-house to his fathers outstretched shoulder, it was over.<p>"Boy!" Genma snarled as he extracted himself from the head shaped hole in the ground. "When did you get shorter?" He had anticipated Ranma's counter and was more then ready to still deliver the attack, but his sons head wasn't where I should have been. His son had to have shrank, it was the only explanation, his fighting skills where not to blame. Not Genma the magnificent!<p>"You sure you didn't hit your head too hard?" Ranma asked with a sigh. "Your ether not seeing strait, or you're hallucinating." Ranma had walked up to his father who stared at him calculatingly.<p>Genma now noticed his son's chest appeared to be much too large to show off mussels, failing to come up with an explanation he decided to take the direct approach, grabbing his son.<p>"Ahhhhhhhhh!" Was heard by a certain bandana clad boy a few miles out from the Jusenkyo training ground, fallowed closely by something close to a thunder-clasp which, if he wasn't mistaken, a slap. "I pity the fool that was on the receiving end of that." He commented off handedly, his sense of direction had put him on the poor end of quite a few disgruntled female bathers' fists. With a sigh he continued his journey. "Ranma just you wait!"<p>Ranko gently held her sore breast blowing on it lightly as her father lay in a crumpled heap. "What the hell do you think your doing? That hurts!" Ranma complained as she continued to blow gently on herself.<p>"Ranma, when did you become a girl?" Came her fathers tortured voice.<p>"Ok now its official you have become a totally crack pot. I've been a girl for what? The last 15 years of my life! And second of all, if you call me Ranma again I'll hurt you. Ever since I told that one boy... I forget his name. Ever since I told him my name you and him both have been calling me Ranma, geez is it so hard to say Ranko, you know as in Ran+Ko! I'm not a horse for god sakes." Ranko humphed as she finished, honestly bringing up THAT name again.<p>"Ranma!" Genma began the respect his elders' speech that was quickly cut off with a foot to his forehead.<p>"ARG! Stupid old man." Ranko slumped her shoulders as she grabbed one of her fathers twitching legs and dragged him to the small shack in the distance. "Hey you're the guide here right?" She asked seeing the bewildered guide.<p>"Um, yes honored sir?" The guide was a bit nervous around this customer. She seemed to have violent tendencies. Maybe it would be best to not say anything about the curse, it would be healthier. How would he explain to her that she was once really a boy and now a girl, permanently.<p>"Um honor sir, may I offer tea?"<p>"Ya sure whatever." Ranko continued to drag her father towards the hut, grinning slightly as she heard every thud of her fathers head travel over the lose rocks. "Stupid old man, you as heavy as a panda."<p>-=-<p>"So honored sir from Japan?" The guide asked trying to start a conversation while the tea began to brew.<p>"Ya pop and I have been on this 10 year training trip. This was suppose to be our last stop before returning home, wherever that is." she paused to look up towards the sky almost wishfully before continuing. "Can you believe my father though I was a boy? I must have hit him to hard."<p>"No sir, very unbelievable." The guide laughed nervously.<p>"hurh" Genma awoke and looked around, seeing a red silk shirt he sighed. "You scared me boy, I thought you went girl on me."<p>The bandana clad boy sighed as he heard another of the colossal slaps. Boy was that man thick, almost as this as the monsters vines he was plowing his way threw, it was odd. He didn't know vines had bark.<p>"It wasn't a dream?" Genma asked patently.<p>"Do I look like a boy to you!" Ranko cried as she ripped the top part of her shirt open showing of the tops of two large mounds.<p>"Then if you're a girl. That means... You're not a boy?" Genma pondered.<p>"Give the man a panda he fingered it out."<p>"So you're not a boy."<p>"Nope."<p>"So you're not my son."<p>"Bingo."<p>"Who are you then and where is my son?"<p>"Arg!"<p>Genma was again sent into lala land where he dreamed about mysterious dancing pandas with wooden signs.<p>"Sir look like he hurt." The guide commented as he looked fearfully upon the pulverized form of the gi'ed man.<p>"I hope."<p>-=-<p>"Pops this is all your fault!" Ranko Growled as she trudged along the stormy street in ankle deep puddles. Ranko hair was cut short, her beloved pigtail gone, her hair no longer then her ears. She wore loose fitting black sweat pants, and a red silk shirt, she didn't mind the shirt all that much, it was the vest under it. The one that held her chest flat enough to pass as a boy.<p>"Why did you have to go and eat that food!" Shy cried hammering her father in the head, causing another small mound to form on his already lumpy head.<p>She and her father had visited a small Amazon village at which a tournament was being held. Evidently her father had been picking his entertainment meal from the prize bin. So unless she wanted to take her father home in pieces, she had to fight in the tournament.<p>Well it just so happens if an outsider 'womans' beats an Amazon 'womans' that woman is hunted to the ends of the earth, or until dead. So here she was, pretending to be the guy her father had thought her to be, all for what? So a half crazed Amazon girl wouldn't find and pulverize her!<p>"Where we heading anyway?" She growled at her father in a deeper voice, one which sounded just as soft as her normal one, yet unmistaken ably male.<p>Genma coward a bit, this was his son/daughters first not violent question since china. "Um, a good friend of mine is here, and he is expecting us to visit." He sighed in relief as his son seemed to except it, he started up smiling just in time to be hammered back down.<p>"Did I tell you its all your fault?" Ranko cried again. For some reason violence wasn't helping to calm her down this time, though it indeed seemed somehow satisfying.<p>-=-<p>Nock, nock.<p>"Aw that must be them!" Soun smiled as he shot to his feet along with his middle daughter Nabiki, both excited about the visitors, and dashed to the front door. Moments later they both came rushing back, Nabiki cowering behind her father for protection for the thing.<p>"Soun! It's me, your old pal Genma!" A deformed lump of black and blue flesh cried happily as it rounded the corner with open arms, a short figure following shortly behind.<p>"G.. Genma?" Soun tested, it sure sounded like his old buddy.<p>"oh!" Genma retrieved his glasses from a safety pocket, and placed them on his face. Like magic his face became normal.<p>"Genma!" Soun cried out and gave his old pal a strong hug, tears spraying from his eyes. "I hardly recognized you!"<p>"Aw yes, just some training with the boy." Genma sweated.<p>"Where is Ranma it's been ages!"<p>A small cough got everyone's attention, Ranko was standing beside her father but seemed a bit shy from the outbreak of emotions. Soun and his daughters admired the 'boy' before them. He was a short slim boy, with short wild hair, almost as wild as its flaming color. His arms seemed to be a bit thin except for the very noticeable muscles that seemed to accent his size, there was no question he was quite strong.<p>His figure and face where feminine, holding a breath taking beauty but was mellowed with the shy look currently decorating his face. He was for lack of any other word, cute.<p>"Aw at last!" Soun dived in for a tight hug, causing Ranko to twitch with pain, and her father with nervousness. "So you're Ranma!" Soun smiled happily pulling back from the hug. "Genma, way let us sit and discuses the old times! And let my daughters introduce themselves."<p>Ranko watched as her father rounded the corner with a nervures smile. She looked back at the tree girls before her, all staring at her in veering degrees of interest, unmistakable she was being checked out.<p>"I.. I'm Ranma Saotome, sorry about this." She said darting her eyes to the side with a faint blush forming; she had a bad feeling about this.<p>-=End Chapter 01a=-
