</div><p>Thyself  Known</p><p><b>Ch.</b><b> 6: Fetching</b></p><p>By Zorknot</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>:   There  once was a boy from Jusenkyo<br/>Owned by TakahashiRumiko<br/>He changed sex with cold water<br/>Changed back with hotter<br/>Y no se si es chicao chico.</p><p><b>What Has Come  Before</b>: Nabiki and Ranma  have fallen for each other after a mind meld saved Nabiki's life. In other  news, Shampoo renounced her Amazon-hood and enlisted Ukyo's aid in carrying out  revenge on Cologne for making her an unwilling sex kitten. Meanwhile Akane is  coming to terms with the idea that she may have acted a teensy bit like a  psychotic uber-bitch earlier, and is wondering if  maybe Ranma might not want to be her fiancé anymore. She wishes things were  different, but she can't think of any way to fix the situation. Well, Miss  Tendo, say goodbye to the status quo...</p><p>~~~~~[BEGIN]~~~~~</p><p><i>"The saris go by me from the embassies.<p>Cloth from the moon. Cloth from another planet.<br/>They look back at the leopard like the leopard.<p>And I...<br/>This print of mine, that has kept its color<br/>Alive through so many cleanings; this dull null...<p>You know what I  was,<br/>You see what I am: change me, change me!"</p></p></p></i></p><p>-Randall Jarell Fr. "The Woman at the Washington Zoo"</p><p>Tendo Akane walked slowly away from Furinkan  High. It was a wonderful day. The sky was deep blue with wispy clouds that  almost weren't there, birds soared majestically over head, and the sun sparkled  prettily off of the broken glass underneath the gaping hole in Hinako-sensei's  English class.</p><p>Akane couldn't enjoy the view though. As  usual, she was thinking about Ranma.</p><p>Was this what love was? Constantly thinking  about someone all day, every day? Having all emotion dedicated to the actions  of one solitary human being? Wanting to beat that person to a pulp one second,  and then wanting to be one with him forever the next?</p><p>A light zephyr of fresh air blew through her  blue school uniform and rustled the sunny tree limbs above her. A curled up,  brown fist of a leaf that had escaped half a year's worth of raking, Neriman  weather, and general decay, skittered toward Akane on the street, blown by the  wind. Akane's eyes riveted themselves to it as she passed, even as they misted  over.</p><p>There was a time when Akane was on top of everything,  when she knew exactly who she was and what she was doing. Sure, she had  problems, but she could handle them, and maybe eventually solve them... Then  there was Ranma, and then there was his mother, and now... Ranma would be at  Tofu's clinic. He had after all saved Nabiki's life. Akane would have to  apologize...only she wasn't sure she could.</p><p>Akane's hands tightened around the brown  handle of her bookbag. She took in a dry, empty breath, and continued walking,  no longer exactly sure of where she was going.</p><p>And so it was that Akane was nearly run over  by Ryoga as he ran down the street at a break neck speed. He skidded to a halt  in front of Akane. A nervous smile was already on his face and his hand already  behind his bandanna clad head when the dust cleared. "Akane-san!  W...what are you doing in Okinawa?"</p><p>"This is Tokyo, Ryoga," she informed the lost boy while  wiping the moisture from her eyes.</p><p>"It is? I could have sworn...I mean...I knew  that! I was just...making a joke! Heh heh."  Ryoga looked off at nothing as he said this, his face growing redder by the  second. Now he turned his head back toward Akane and lowered his hand. He  frowned. "You were crying...What did that bastard Ranma do to you now? I'll  kill him! I'll pound him so far into the dirt his feet will be kicking in Times Square! Or rather... they won't be... because  he'll be dead!"</p><p>"Thanks, Ryoga, but it's not really his fault  this time. It's mine. I just feel so...it's nothing." Akane sighed and tried to  smile.</p><p>"It can't be your fault! Did he say it was  your fault? He's wrong! He's telling you lies,  Akane-san! Don't listen to him!" Ryoga shook his fist in anger.</p><p>Truth be known, Akane was a little afraid of  Ryoga. Razor sharp belts whizzing through her hair, barely missing her neck,  attempts at hugs that crushed concrete pillars, and his various maniacal  obsessions just made Akane a little uneasy around him. But the main reason she  was afraid of Ryoga was that, looking into his angry yellow-brown eyes, every  now and then Akane got the queasy sensation that she was looking at a distorted  reflection of herself.</p><p>"Why do you fight with  Ranma so much?" Akane asked suddenly.</p><p>Ryoga was taken aback for a moment but soon  recovered. "Because of him, I've seen Hell! He keeps running away and tricking  me instead of fighting like a man! Plus, he mistreats you all the time! I will  destroy his happiness if it's the last thing I do!"</p><p>"What do you mean you've seen Hell? You say  that all the time, and it seems like something important, but you never say  what it is..."</p><p>Ryoga's face was now somber and his eyes lost  a little of their fire. "You wouldn't understand, Akane-san. There's no way you  could know the tortures he put me through."</p><p>"What tortures? It can't just be the bread,  can it?"</p><p>"IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BREAD! Don't LISTEN to  him Akane! You've never been to an all boy's school.  You can't know what it's like. Maybe if you were a martial artist..."</p><p>"I <i>AM</i>  A MARTIAL ARTIST!" Akane fumed.</p><p>"Um...right! Of course you are! I meant... if  you were a martial artist GUY. Yeah. If you were a martial artist AND a guy you  would understand...er gotta  go, bye!" Ryoga smiled nervously and ran off in the direction he came, yelling  "Just you wait, Ranma! Today you meet your doom!"</p><p>Akane felt sick. She could stop Ryoga, keep  him from fighting Ranma, but then again she couldn't. Some part of her <i>wanted</i> Ryoga to beat Ranma to a pulp.  Some part of her wished she could do it herself. But she would get just as much  pleasure from nursing Ranma back to health, mending his wounds, feeding  him...only she couldn't do any of that. She couldn't cook, and bandages in  general were recondite to her.</p><p>What was wrong with her? Why couldn't she do  anything? Why was she so clumsy? It shouldn't be so hard to learn how to swim,  or sew, or cook, and Ranma made it all look so damned  easy...</p><p>Ranma. It all came  back to him.</p><p>Akane kicked a stone idly as she walked. Her  eyes wandered to her bookbag, wherein a letter rested amidst well-worn books  and folders. A letter she must not let anyone see. The assistant principal had  something else to say to Akane after she got the phone call... Her grades were  dropping through the floor.</p><p>Before Ranma had come to Nerima, Akane had  been an honor student. She had never gotten lower than a "B" in anything.  Now...she was doing okay in History, but she was failing everything else. She  was just too distracted.</p><p>Was this love? Because if  it was, Akane wanted out.</p><p>Only she didn't.</p><p>It was all so frustrating. Akane needed to  get home and smash a few bricks with her fists. That would make her feel  better.</p><p>Only it wouldn't.</p><p>She came upon an abandoned lot that wasn't  quite as abandoned as it usually was. Through the chain link fence, Akane could  see Shampoo and Ukyo sitting in the shade of a cherry tree, talking animatedly  about something.</p><p>Akane entertained the brief fantasy that they  were both declaring their lesbian love for one another and would from now on  leave Akane to her Ranma troubles in peace. Unfortunately, it was far more  likely that the two were planning something.</p><p>Akane shrugged. She desperately needed a  distraction from her thoughts, even if the distraction was the two prettier and  more talented rivals for Ranma's affection. She bound over the fence and  slipped a bit in the mud as she landed, waving her arms around to keep balance.</p><p>"Damn, Sugar, I'm surprised you cleared the  fence!" Ukyo quipped. She and Shampoo had just been talking about how wrong for  Ranma Akane was, something they had always been in agreement on, when the girl  had stumbled into their midst.</p><p>"Shut up, Ukyo. I have enough problems  without your insults on top of it all. So why don't you tell me just what you  two have planned?"</p><p>Ukyo showed her hands, "It's kind of Shampoo's  business, Sugar. It really doesn't concern you."</p><p>"DOESN'T CONCERN ME?" Akane yelled, "He's MY  fiancé dammit!" Akane winced immediately afterwards.  She had, for the umpteenth time, cancelled the engagement that very morning.</p><p>"This isn't about Ranchan, Akane. When are  you going to learn to listen? It's <i>Shampoo's</i>  business. Besides he's my fiancé too you know..."</p><p>"Ukyo, stop."  Shampoo put a hand on Ukyo's shoulder. "Is Akane's business  too."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Akane affected by Amazon technique. For almost year now."</p><p>"What?" Akane said.</p><p>"Sai  Fang Heng Gow."  Shampoo explained.</p><p>"Oh." Akane nodded. "Huh?"</p><p>"Shampoo— Honey, you're not making things  much clearer here," Ukyo noted.</p><p>"Shampoo use Sai  Fang Heng Gow on Akane.  Make Akane forget Ranma," Shampoo said motioning toward her temple.</p><p>"You mean that Shiatsu attack! You know I've  been to several salons since then, and I've never been able to recreate that  refreshed feeling."</p><p>Shampoo smiled proudly "Shampoo give too too good brainwashing. No  other compare."</p><p>"Wait a minute here," Ukyo held up her hands  "you mean you can brainwash people?"</p><p>Shampoo nodded, "Is true. Though need special  shampoo to do."</p><p>"Why aren't you married to Ranma right now  then?" Ukyo knew that if SHE could brainwash people she'd...she'd what?  Manipulate Ranma's mind so that he'd love her? Give Akane and Shampoo a  lobotomy? Ukyo shook her head. She couldn't do that. Not to Ranma, probably not  to anybody. But she had thought of it...when had she gotten this desperate?</p><p>Shampoo was silent for a while. "Ranma like Akane. I know this from when give kiss of  marriage. Ranma let violent girl hit. Ranma not like it when  make Akane forget him. Ranma not Ranma if change mind. Shampoo hand  tied."</p><p>"Quit talking as if I'm not here!" Akane  demanded.</p><p>Shampoo turned to Akane with half-lidded  eyes. "I no like you. You is not warrior, you is small child in body of womans what play with Art." She looked away, "I forget  sometime it not all you fault."</p><p>Akane raised her fist. "Look who's talking,  you Chinese bimbo!"</p><p>Ukyo marveled at how thoroughly Akane  illustrated Shampoo's point for a moment before returning her attention to  Shampoo. "Just what are you saying, Shampoo?"</p><p>"Sai Fang Heng Gow what erase memory, but  must have formula 110 shampoo to make last for longer than few minute. It freeze brain, keep from changing too much." Shampoo took in  a breath and then let it out. "Keep Akane from learning new skill."</p><p>A wind picked up, waving the wispy  yellow-green grass of the lot. A leaf tumbled across the ground between the  three girls. Akane felt a chill.</p><p>Ukyo blinked her eyes in understanding.  "So...all this time...Akane not being able to learn any new techniques, or how  to swim, or cook..."</p><p>"I can cook curry pretty well now, thank you  very much!"</p><p>"...or listen," Ukyo continued, "it's all from this technique you performed on her almost a  year ago?"</p><p>Shampoo shook her head. "Not from technique,  from formula 110 shampoo. One dose just enough to keep brain frozen until Sai Fang Heng Gow  become permanent, but Akane receive second dose..."</p><p>"Ranma...he washed my hair with the same  formula of shampoo!" Akane remembered. "He tried to cure me but made things  even worse! And all to satisfy his ego! All because he  couldn't handle me not remembering him!"</p><p>"Listen, Jackass, Ranma couldn't have known  it would do that to you! Ranma isn't to blame for every thing that happens to  you! I would think you would have learned that...by...now." Ukyo deflated a  little. "Oh."</p><p>Shampoo nodded. "Is all  Shampoo fault."</p><p>"Well it was your fault too, Sugar. Let's not  forget that," Ukyo pointed out.</p><p>"That what I say! Is all  Shampoo fault!"</p><p>Ukyo frowned for moment then hit her palm  with her fist. "You want to say 'it's all MY fault!'"</p><p>"But how could it have been your fault, Ukyo?  You weren't even there." Akane asked.</p><p>Ukyo buried her forehead in her palm.</p><p>"Is all...my...fault" Shampoo repeated. "I  know what shampoo do, and still almost use again on Akane before Ranma punch to  beat. Akane probably get better at curry because is skill she know before. Just  improve on. But no can learn new food she never make  before."</p><p>Akane thought back. Just before that day when  she challenged Shampoo, she had given up on Tofu, trained in Martial Arts  Rhythmic Gymnastics, had been getting A's in Algebra and Biology, and was maybe  possibly just starting to think of Ranma as more than a strange sort of friend  while at the same time getting annoyed that he didn't protest Shampoo's  affections more.</p><p>After Shampoo used her technique...what?  Things happened. She helped out Ranma a few times, had a few battles, but  emotionally and ability-wise she had been in a holding pattern ever since. She  had learned no new techniques, her grades in everything that required more than  rote memorization had started to fall, and even after Ranma proved himself  hundreds of times to her...Things between them had gotten worse, not better. It  was all a vicious cycle that she couldn't seem to break out of... "I...I thought  it was stress...I thought..."</p><p>"Wait a minute here," Ukyo said, "How is it  she can learn information like this, but not how to do anything?"</p><p>"Brain tricky.  People what have no memory of self still know how talk. Sometime in village,  someone have brain problem. No can use part of face or body but just fine with  other parts. Sometime even get new ability. 110 formula  work on parts what make new techniques, but must use Sai  Fang Heng Gow to change  other parts."</p><p>"Why now?" Akane asked, "Why tell me now? All  this time and you wait till now to gloat! Did Ranma sleep with you? Is that it?  Did the two of you get together after I left and have sex kitty style or  something?"</p><p>"What Violent Girl know  about it?" Shampoo screamed, "She no get anything! She  stupid even before Shampoo use shampoo! Akane watch and do nothing! Akane watch  Ranma cat almost...almost..."</p><p>"What are you talking about? You two were  pawing at each other like cats in heat! How is that different from what you  normally do?"</p><p>Ukyo stepped in front of Shampoo. "Akane,  Shampoo's not an Amazon anymore. She renounced her marriage to Ranma; that's  why she told you all this. The way I figure it, you deserve what you got. Now  leave, before I decide to reconsider my pledge not to beat up the weak."</p><p>"What? But..."</p><p>"Leave, Akane. Maybe it's not all your fault,  but I don't care right now. Just go."</p><p>Akane stood for a moment trying to think of  something to say, but the look in Ukyo's eyes told her that talking right now  wasn't the smartest of ideas. Besides what did she care? These were her rivals!  Resolved, Akane turned back toward the fence.</p><p>They were also her friends.</p><p>Akane slammed her open palm into on of the  metal posts of the fence. It bent inward deeply from the blow. Letting her  frustration move her now, Akane threw her bookbag down, grabbed the links of  the fence with her hands pulling, ripping, and tearing them apart with a series  of snaps and low creaking sounds.</p><p>Her hands bleeding now, Akane picked her bag  up again, shoved herself through the hole she had made in the fence and walked  on to Tofu's clinic as the implications of everything she had learned  percolated in the blast furnace of her mind.</p><p>"Note to self," Ukyo muttered, staring  blankly at the hole in the fence, "Never, under any circumstances, let Akane  hit me."</p><p>Shampoo nodded. "Is very good note."</p><p>She was a girl. She stood naked in front of  the full-length mirror in Tomo Hoko's bedroom, fondling herself. But she was  not Tomo Hoko.</p><p>The person in the mirror was a normal looking  teenage girl. Not a bombshell by any means; she had average dimensions and long  hair with bangs that partially hid a face that was just pretty enough to be  unnoticeable in a crowd, which suited her just fine. But it wasn't her. Or was  it?</p><p>She caressed her anatomy, tickling nerves on  each patch of skin that told her that she was the same as this girl in the  mirror. <i>Is this me? Is this my body? Are  these my breasts? Are these my thighs? Is this my...</i> She bit her lower lip,  barely stifling an involuntary squeal of pleasure. <i>They say beauty is only skin deep...but isn't the skin the largest  organ in the body? Isn't how you look the main component of who you are?</i></p><p>Tears passed down her cheeks even as shudders  of pleasure passed through her. She cried now even more than earlier, in the  bathroom, when she had been slicing her arms with a razor. Not to kill. She  didn't want to die, not yet anyway. No, she needed pain, she needed pleasure, she needed this body that she saw reflected back at her to  convince her that she belonged here, that she could stop looking, that here in  front of her, was her true self.</p><p>But she knew that wasn't true.</p><p>She woke that morning in Tomo Hoko's bed, to the  sound of Hoko's mother knocking on the door. If she had gotten up then or even  remained silent, she would right now be following Nabiki around or  participating in some grand scheme of hers. Instead, she had taken a perverse  pleasure in telling the woman to fuck off.</p><p>Naturally, Hoko's mother was concerned and  came through the door, and naturally, upon seeing the girl she thought to be  her daughter openly masturbating she had become even more worried. The last  straw though, she reflected, had been when she asked Hoko's mother if she  wanted to help.</p><p>That was stupid.</p><p>Now, she was essentially under house arrest,  with her ad hoc mother concerned about how "ill" she was. Ill indeed. She wondered idly now, as the intense  feelings she had generated washed out of her in a sigh of ecstasy, how  concerned Hoko's mother would be if she knew that the real Tomo Hoko was stone  dead, cut into pieces and laying strewn about the city dump.</p><p>Perhaps the poor woman would have a heart  attack and save her from having to kill the bitch herself.</p><p>Focusing on her image in the mirror and  blurring out the marks on her arms with her mind, she brought out her demon  cloth from null space and passed it over herself. When she looked in the mirror  again, the marks were gone. It wouldn't do to have herself thrown into a mental  institution for her little weakness this morning. If she didn't already have a  goal in mind, going to a mental institution might actually be fun, but she had  to remain focused as much as possible.</p><p>She smirked to herself. One of the perks of  owning the cursed demon cloth was that she never had to shave, or cut her hair,  or clip her toenails, or even bathe if she didn't want to. She was a little  slow in catching on to this hidden benefit, but now she took it for granted. Sometimes...like today...she missed all that though.</p><p><i>   The Migration never ends</i></p><p>The Migration. The fucking Ijuu. Someone else had  joined it, she could feel it like a static charge in  her brain. There was no doubt in her mind that it was Ranma. The bastard would  probably get through the initial stages smelling like roses. He had people that  cared about him, after all, even if he was an arrogant prick. She'd like to see  what he'd do if he had to grow up in a orphanage, spent all his time moving from  place to place without any ties to anyone, without a single constant save  himself. She'd like to see what he'd do if even that last refuge eroded away,  leaving nothing but a shadow...a desperate, hungry shadow...</p><p>But she'd settle for a gruesome death in a  pinch.</p><p>She took a breath and calmed herself. She had  to convince Hoko's mother that she was alright and that it was just especially  painful cramps or something. She had to be ready for Nabiki's scrutiny, and  while she could do this with enough concentration, she had to be mellow.</p><p>First things first, she had to get dressed.  She went to the dresser and opened the top drawer. The  panties. She picked up a pair and smelled them, but they just weren't as  fulfilling laundered. Tomorrow at school she'd be in the girls' locker room and  she'd get all the panty action she wanted there. If she  hadn't blown it this morning...</p><p>But no matter. She  put on the panties and a bra she found, taking time to leer at herself in the mirror a bit, and then went to the closet for  some outer wear.</p><p>She decided she liked being a girl. It was  like she was her own prostitute, and she didn't have to pay. Even the  masturbation was wonderful, once she got the hang of it.</p><p>Hoko's mother was a pain. She wished she  could just kill her, but of course if she did, then she'd have to kill Hoko's  father as well, and then the people at Mr. Tomo's business firm would wonder  where he'd run off to, and things would lead to more complicated things. It  just wasn't worth it.</p><p>She decided to go with a short skirt and dark  colored top with a jeans jacket. She put on long black socks that went past the  knee and black sneakers. She looked in the mirror again. It seemed okay, but as  far as she knew she could be breaking several major fashion rules. She blinked.  The girl in the mirror blinked. She liked how she looked right now.</p><p>There was a pang as she realized she had lost  another part of herself.</p><p>"I am Copycat Ken." She asserted to her  reflection... but it felt wrong, alien now. She was not Ken anymore. Ken would  have just copied whatever Hoko had worn before she died. Now after several  months of stalking people, of killing them, stealing their lives and making  them her own for days, even weeks on end, she could no longer say with any  certainty whether she was male or female. "I <i>was</i> Copycat Ken" she said sadly, "Now, I'm just Copycat"</p><p>Ever since that last battle with Ranma, she  had been unable to find her true form, the body she had been born with. Ever  since then, she could only be other people, never herself. She tried to  remember what she looked like, but she had no pictures of herself,  and instead of getting closer to finding her original form, she found it  slipping further and further away.</p><p>Copycat left the room, whereupon she was quickly  intercepted by Hoko's mother. "Just where do you think you're going, young  lady?"</p><p>Copycat smiled, "I feel much better now, Mom.  I was just...I had a weird...personal dream...and I didn't expect you there..."</p><p>Hoko's mother nodded. "I know you're growing  up, but that's really no excuse for...Hoko, dear, that just didn't seem like  you at all. I was almost sure you were possessed or something like in that  American movie...Are you sure you're alright?"</p><p>"I'm fine, Mom! I'm going to go to Tofu's  anyway to get a note for class tomorrow. I'm sure if there's anything wrong  he'll find it."</p><p>"Do you mind if I go with you? You really had  me worried."</p><p>"Oh okay. How do I look?"</p><p>"You look...very fetching."</p><p>Copycat laughed.</p><p>"What's funny, dear?"</p><p>"Nothing," she waved it off sobering, "just  a private joke."</p><p>"I'll just get my purse and then we can go,  okay?"</p><p>"Sure" Copycat agreed. She crossed her arms  and leaned up against the wall as she waited for Hoko's mother. She allowed  herself to think optimistically for a few moments. Four months of careful  planning, stalking, observing and she was now almost ready to make her move on  Saotome. First, though, she had to take out his most effective defense against  her...Nabiki. The Ijuu...it would complicate things,  but no matter what, the end result would be the same.</p><p>Ranma was going to die.</p><p>"PREPARE TO DIE, RANMA!" Hibiki  Ryoga ran along the street away from Akane. She had gotten angry at him! Angry. At him! It had to be Ranma's fault. All those awful  insults he threw at Akane every day...it must have been rubbing off on him!</p><p>How could he say that Akane wasn't a martial  artist! She was a wonderful martial artist! Not compared to himself or Ranma or  Mousse or even Kuno in a real no-holds-barred fight, but still better than  most. Maybe he could convince Akane to go on a training trip with him! That way  she could feel better about her martial arts and he could have all that time  alone with her!</p><p>But...if she refused...</p><p><i>Akane  in a yellow sun dress and white hat looks up at Ryoga with tears in her eyes  and shakes her head. "No, Ryoga, I'm afraid I cannot go with you on a training  trip," Akane lifts the back of her hand to her brow and looks away in anguish,  "for, alas, my heart belongs to Ranma, and I cannot bear to be apart from  him..."</i></p><p>Ryoga shook his head violently. No! His  fragile heart of glass could not withstand it!</p><p>Ryoga thought he heard Ranma just then. Ranma...calling him a coward.</p><p>"NO! I am no coward, Ranma! Just you wait! Today  you meet your doom!" Ryoga ran on. He had to keep moving. Keep his goal in  mind...otherwise he'd lose track and start to think of other things.</p><p>Why DID he fight Ranma so much?</p><p>It was a question that Ryoga himself asked  from time to time in the dark chill of night beside a dying fire. But he  already knew the answer, and thinking about it just drove him further into the  dark depths of his insurmountable depression.</p><p>So Ryoga kept running, and concentrated  solely on that, and on his goal. He paid no heed to stray thoughts or to the  passing scenery. Nothing could distract him from his revenge. "RANMA! PREPARE TO..."</p><p>"...shake vigorously and pour the liquid down  the throat." Dr. Tofu looked up and smiled at the young man who had just made a  rather large hole in the wall of the examination room. "Good to see you, Ryoga,  but you know you really shouldn't disturb me when I'm with another patient."</p><p>"Oh we don't mind, doctor. It's nice knowing  that my husband and I aren't THAT strange." Yamashita Niburi adjusted the  position of her arm underneath her husband's small body with a smile. "Isn't  that right, my little sweetums?" she tickled her  husband's nose with her finger.</p><p>"Thtop that! Woman,  I thweal..."</p><p>"Um...is Ranma here? I'm trying to kill him."  Ryoga said eying the Yamashitas. If he didn't know  any better he'd swear that the baby had just talked.</p><p>"He's in the waiting room," Tofu pointed to  the door, "Just take it outside if you could and...make  sure Ranma is wearing his earrings."</p><p>Ryoga headed for the door.</p><p>"Ryoga..."Tofu called after him.</p><p>"What!" Ryoga snapped back.</p><p>"That's the closet."</p><p>"What's Ranma doing in the closet? I thought  you said he was in the waiting room."</p><p>"I did. The waiting room is over <i>there,</i>" Tofu pointed again, "that door  leads to the closet."</p><p>"So where's Ranma?"</p><p>"In the waiting room!"</p><p>"But you just said..."</p><p>The baby spoke up, "Ith  that...<i>the </i>Lyoga?  Hibiki Lyoga...the famouth lotht tlavelel?"</p><p>"Huh?" Ryoga asked...the baby DID talk!</p><p>"They tell thtolies  about you in Thikoku! Evely  week ol tho you letuln to The Town of the Boal  with giftth flom dithtant landth! That'th how I  came aclotht the map to the Fountain of Youth!"</p><p>"Ryoga, have you been to the Fountain of  Youth?" Tofu asked, grabbing Ryoga by the shoulders.</p><p>"Y...yeah." His eyes  widened, "So that's why that baby can talk!"</p><p>"Do you know of any cure?" Tofu asked.</p><p>"Er...have you  tried hot water?"</p><p>"Hot water?"</p><p>"You know...like Jusenkyo?"</p><p>Dr. Tofu pushed his glasses up on his nose.  He turned on the hot water in the sink. When it was just short of scalding he  filled a glass and poured it on the baby. In that instant, all of Yamashita  Ichiro's eighty-five kilos returned to him and he fell to the ground with  nothing but a bit of blanket to cover his special purpose.</p><p>"Looking for portents in the stars, we must  remain mindful of our feet." Tofu said over the stunned man on the floor.</p><p>"You mean all this time...ALL this time I  spent as helpless baby...and THAT'S the cure?" Ichiro stood up shakily, barely  remembering to cover himself.</p><p>"It wasn't that obvious, I mean, who would  think of throwing water that hot on an infant?" Niburi argued.</p><p>"It's not a cure...You'll be a baby again  with a splash of cold water," Ryoga noted.</p><p>"How do you know that exactly, Ryoga?" Tofu  asked chuckling. "If I didn't know any better, I'd say you fell in yourself!"</p><p>Ryoga laughed nervously and his hand found  itself on the back of his head. "Umm...where was Ranma again?"</p><p>Niburi put a hand on Ryoga's shoulder. "I'll  lead you to her. It's the least I can do."</p><p>"Oh, so you're going off with other men, now,  is that it?" Ichiro quipped.</p><p>Niburi turned back. "Is my little Ichikins worried I might leave him? I swear I'll be right  back and we can play a nice little game of peek-a-boo." Niburi laughed. "You're  <i>such</i> a baby!"</p><p>As they went through the doorway to the  waiting room, Ryoga heard Ichiro remark, "I'm never going to live this down, am  I?"</p><p>It made him smile for a moment.</p><p>Then of course he saw Ranma-chan sitting  suspiciously close to Nabiki while they played some sort of card game with  Kasumi. Genma and Soun played shogi in the opposite  corner. <i>Ranma, that bastard! Having fun  with other women while Akane suffers...</i></p><p>"You're going to have to tell her some time you  know. It's just going to get worse if you don't," Niburi said softly.</p><p>Ryoga nodded. "I know, I've been wanting to,  but things get so complicated...Wait a minute!" Ryoga turned toward Niburi,  "How did you know about Akane?"</p><p>"Hmm?" Niburi looked  up slightly, showing her mature, delicate complexion with its slight smile,  "Akane? So sorry, I was talking about Ranma!" She indicated the red-head with a  raised open hand.</p><p>Ryoga was silent.</p><p>"Oh, it's obvious! Well, if Ranma hadn't told  me she was really a girl all along I might not have made the connection I  suppose but..."</p><p>"Ranma said that? No. Ranma's a guy. He would  never say something like that. That'd be like giving up. And even if he <i>were</i> a girl I would never..."</p><p>"Right. You would  never. So you just find any excuse to be with her."</p><p>"Listen, lady, you got your signals crossed  or something. Ranma's my worst nightmare. Nothing would make me happier than to  see her...him dead."</p><p>Niburi sighed. "Fine, fine.  Just trying to give some advice. If you don't mind  then, I'll just leave you to your homicide." She smiled impishly "It's been a  while since I've seen my husband all grow'd up."</p><p>Ryoga stood unmoving for a moment after  Niburi went back into the office, looking at the girls and Ranma. He couldn't  just threaten to kill Ranma again, not after what Niburi said. It'd be like  proving her right...</p><p>Ranma-chan laughed, and damned if it didn't  happen in slow motion... with sparkles.</p><p>Ryoga squeezed his eyes shut against the  image, but even as he did so, he wasn't sure if he was trying to keep it out,  or tying to keep it in. Ryoga could feel it sure as anything...he was about to  spend a long time on the road.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, though, he had to  say something..."Ranma, how dare you go out with Nabiki behind Akane's back!"</p><p>Ranma turned her head slowly in Ryoga's  direction. "Howdy, Oinkster!  Good of you to join us! Say, you're a guy right?"  Ranma picked up a card that Kasumi had just  shown her and Nabiki and asked, "Tell me, what does this look  like to you?"</p><p>"A Rorschach inkblot," Ryoga answered in  spite of himself.</p><p>"Yeah, I <i>know</i>  that. Why do you think we're messing with them? So... what do you see?"</p><p>Ryoga found himself studying the mirror image  on the card. It was random and splotchy, of course, but there was something  about it.  Thin on either end, wide  closer the center and then thin again where the fold would be, it looked  disturbingly like... "A mask. Like one of those cheap  plastic Halloween things."</p><p>"Oh come on! It's a bra! Look there are the straps..."</p><p>Ryoga's eyes shifted to Nabiki's amused and  smug expression and then back to Ranma.</p><p>"Okay...maybe I'm a little worried about Mom  coming, okay? I could have told you that."</p><p>"Ranma-chan's right,  Nabiki. That could be what it is. The inkblots are not precise. The  things you see in them are like the symbols in a dream. Sometimes their meaning  is quite literal, as would be the case if Ranma is only worried about having to  wear a bra. Other times though, they can be much larger. Nabiki, how would you  feel if Ranma was never a man again?"</p><p>"It really wouldn't bother me," Nabiki  replied seriously. "I always kind of liked Ranma as a girl  anyway." Nabiki turned to Ranma now, "I know, I know, but I have to say  it. You seem freer somehow. More yourself. Except when your mother's around of course."</p><p>"Well, I guess I <i>am</i> pretty well built..." Ranma said pushing out her breasts.</p><p>"And that right there proves you'll always be  a man inside," Nabiki smirked. "Hey, Kasumi, is it  just me or is Ranma bigger?"</p><p>"Oh my, Ranma-chan's growing up!"</p><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><p>"Let me check..." Nabiki grabbed Ranma's  breast.</p><p>"HEY!"</p><p>"Yep, definitely bigger than last time."  Nabiki nodded officially.</p><p>"Let's see how big YOU are..." Ranma-chan  threatened and grabbed a hand full of Nabiki.</p><p>Ryoga couldn't take it anymore. "Ranma! What do you think you're doing?"</p><p>Ranma, out of reflex, immediately brought her  hand back to her side. "What are ya talking about?"</p><p>"Akane's your fiancée!"</p><p>"Actually, I'm his fiancée now," Nabiki  informed.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Ranma turned to Ryoga. "Look, Pigface, Akane broke it off again this morning, and a lot  of things happened since then, alright? It's not the first time it's happened;  let's just hope it's the last. I would think you'd be happy anyway."</p><p>"What about your honor, Ranma?"</p><p>"Hey, Nabiki's a Tendo too, you know, and  Shampoo and Ukyo both have valid claims to boot. Why are you getting so worked up  over this?"</p><p>"I'm not talking about your stupid  engagement! I'm talking about Akane's feelings! She deserves to be  told...instead you're...groping Nabiki without her knowing!"</p><p>"Hmmm...now why does  this sound familiar? Oh yeah! You've been copping free feels from Akane without  letting her know! Listen, man, right now, I don't even want to think about her,  and I don't think I could stand living with her for the rest of my life. She's  free, no strings attached. Get her while she's hot."</p><p>Ryoga felt the depression building. The  depression that would never go away, that was always there, waiting for him,  whenever he dared think clearly. If Akane wasn't Ranma's fiancée, then he  wouldn't have an excuse to...to... "I won't allow it. I can't! I..."</p><p>A splash of cold water shocked Ryoga and  turned him into a piglet. He watched with surprise as Kasumi gently placed the  empty fire bucket to her side. "Forgive me, Ryoga-kun," she bowed, "but you  were disturbing our harmony."</p><p>"Hey I just thought of something..." Ranma  said, "If my female side is growing, how come Ryoga's pig form hasn't gotten  bigger or anything?"</p><p>"Maybe his curse is special... or maybe he  fell in a different spring and the curses mixed?" Nabiki shrugged.</p><p>"Yeah...I'll have to ask him when I get the  chance."</p><p>Ryoga in pig form turned and clicked away from Ranma and the  others. It was so easy for Ranma. Always so easy. In  junior high, it had taken months for Ryoga to establish himself as the top  martial artist. It had taken Ranma a day to take it away, making Ryoga once  again just a "stupid lost boy." Ryoga challenged Ranma again and again, but  each time Ranma would win. Ryoga became a joke. He lost all of the friends he  had made. He got lost more and more often. Everyday Ryoga would see Ranma laughing  with friends that were once his, succeeding in all the areas where he had  failed. It was Hell. Pure and simple. And Ranma was an  undefeatable guardian of paradise...of the bread, of the respect, of  Akane...Everything that Ryoga wanted, Ranma would already have. But now Akane  was free. Now Ryoga could see her without guilt...and for some reason he wasn't  at all happy.</p><p>For some reason, he was even more depressed.</p><p>Two and a half centimeters.  That was all.</p><p>No divine hand. No chivalrous knight. No moat  teaming with fantastic and terrible monsters. Just two and a  half centimeters. That was all that protected Tendo Akane from Ranma's  words as they stabbed unerringly into her heart.</p><p>Then again if the door had been a little  thicker, maybe Akane would have gone inside. Maybe she would have seen first  hand what she had heard. That would have been worse.</p><p>There were a lot of ifs. If she had helped  Ranma out of the Nekoken, if she had kept him away from Shampoo, if she hadn't  been so cruel to him that morning, if his mother hadn't shown up when she did,  if Shampoo hadn't used her shampoo to begin with...if, if, if, if. It made no  difference.</p><p>Nabiki was fine, even if she was in danger of  dying. As long as Nabiki didn't come near her, Akane wouldn't kill her. Akane  felt her mallet hand itching, and it took everything she had not to go through  the door and swing away at Ranma. She knew he wasn't hers anymore, maybe never  was, but she just couldn't grasp the meaning of that. It was another unknown  variable in the indecipherable math equation that was her life.</p><p>Then there was Ryoga. P-chan. Try as she  might, she could not think of the two entities as being the same person, even  with this direct evidence. And how many times had Ranma tried to tell her, even  before Shampoo's formula 110? Shampoo was right. She had been stupid even  before. But she needed P-chan, needed someone to talk to, someone she could  trust. Even now, if P-chan came to her, she would hold him and cry and tell him  everything just like before, even knowing what she knew, because she could not  think of hurting the poor creature. She wished he would come out. She was so  lost...</p><p>As if summoned by her thoughts, P-chan jumped out of a window and  landed beside her. "Come here, P-chan, I...I need you right now."</p><p>P-chan hesitated, then went to her.</p><p>Akane crouched and grabbed the pig, cradling him in her arms. She  thought of entering the clinic, but it didn't seem like a good idea. If she  went inside, she would do something she would regret. Whether it was hurt  someone she loved, or simply break down. So Akane gathered up P-chan and her  distended emotions and turned away slowly from the door of the clinic.</p><p>Just then, she saw Nabiki's friend Hoko  walking with her mother toward the clinic. Caught between not wanting to seem  rude and walk away and not wanting to talk to anyone, Akane wavered at the door  until Hoko was there. "Good afternoon, Hoko-senpai," Akane greeted in a subdued  tone with a small bow. "Tomo-san" Akane bowed deeper to Hoko's mother.</p><p>"Hey, Akane-chan!  What are you doing here?" Hoko asked.</p><p>"I...um...I was just leaving. It's been a bad  day...I'd rather not talk about it." Akane bowed again, trying to smile and  only managing a grimace. She moved to go, but then Hoko grabbed her forcibly by  the shoulder, surprising her, and causing P-chan to bwee  in alarm.</p><p>She found herself looking into the older  girl's dark brown eyes. They were fierce, challenging...compassionate. Hoko  smiled. "It's going to be okay, Akane-chan. It's all going to be okay."</p><p>Akane nodded hesitantly. When Hoko released  her shoulder, she left without any other words. She walked briskly from the  clinic, needing to get away.</p><p>For some reason, what Hoko said gave her the creeps.</p><p>"Great," Akane muttered, "I already felt angry, confused, and  depressed...now I'm scared on top of that." Akane looked at the pig in her  arms, looking up at her with a concerned expression. There was no way that the  little pig could be the same as Ranma's violent martial arts rival that demolished  city blocks on accident... Akane needed to think, she was all jumbled up  inside. Luckily there was one place she could go, one refuge from the pain of  living, a sanctuary from the thousand natural shocks inherent in the flesh that  would not require excessive violence or the implementation of jagged, pointy  objects to enter.</p><p>"Come on, P-chan," Akane said, "I need ice cream."</p><p>Copycat was surprised to find the clinic so crowded.  When she saw Ranma she stopped stock still. It took all she had not to pull out  a tanto from null-space and slay the bastard then and there. But that would be  too fair. Ranma would win in a fair fight.</p><p>"Hoko-chan?" Hoko's  mother asked, "Is something wrong?"</p><p>"Nothing, Mom, just had a strange thought..."</p><p>"It wasn't...personal...was it?"</p><p>"Mom!" Copycat  laughed. It was easy to pretend to be Tomo's child. She had plenty of practice  pretending to be other people's children after all. First in foster families,  then with the families of the people she killed. Every time trying to make it  work, but knowing that it wouldn't. In a way, she did love Tomo. In the end, it  didn't matter. She'd still have to leave her eventually...if she didn't kill  her.</p><p>Nabiki got up from her seat. "Hoko! You're alright?"</p><p>Copycat nodded, "That's what I keep telling  Mom, but she won't believe me."</p><p>Nabiki frowned and seemed a little distracted  as she said "Well...you know how parents can be..."</p><p>A thirty-ish woman,  attractive, yet dressed so conservatively she seemed older at first glance,  left Tofu's office, her arm around that of a well-built man in a brown gi  (probably Tofu's) with short burnt umber hair that spiked and curled wildly  about the top of his head. Copycat got the impression that they had gotten  together primarily because she liked to clean messes and he liked to make them.  The two either had trouble finding time together, or one of them was impotent,  because the woman didn't have the look of a mother, rather she had the slightly  weary, hopeful look of someone worried she might never become one. Copycat was  quite familiar with the type.</p><p>The woman introduced the man to Nabiki and  Nabiki bowed and thanked her. Apparently the couple was Yamashita Niburi and  Ichiro, and apparently the woman, Niburi, had somehow helped save Nabiki's  life. Then Nabiki introduced Copycat as Tomo Hoko and she greeted and thanked  them. Copycat was genuinely thankful that Niburi had saved the life of her  "best friend," If she hadn't, Copycat would not be able to kill her.</p><p>Nabiki's powers of perception were perhaps  even greater than Copycat's, even without the surveillance equipment with which  the girl had a near symbiotic relationship. Copycat had chosen her first  victim, Buntaro, based on the idea that no one knew who he was, that no one  cared about him. After the second day at school, Nabiki approached Copycat and  wanted to know what was going on, why Buntaro was acting so differently.  Copycat said that it was trouble at home, the same excuse she had offered case  workers years before she had joined the Ijuu and the  oni offered her the demon cloth and the camera that could allow her to copy any  ability.</p><p>Nabiki offered Buntaro a job.</p><p>When they found Buntaro's  body, as Copycat hadn't yet hit upon the idea that merely burying a corpse was  not enough, Copycat had to find someone else. It must have seemed strange to  the police that the body was a week dead, while Buntaro was last seen the day  before, but there was nothing in the paper about it. By chance Copycat had been  using another form at the time, that of a male cop she observed earlier asleep  on some sort of stake out, to do some spying on Ranma, otherwise she might have  been found out. Aside from Buntaro's destitute  mother, Nabiki was the only one at the funeral. Copycat had shown up as Generic  Overworked Cop and asked Nabiki what her relationship was to the deceased.</p><p>"Potential friend," Nabiki had said simply.</p><p>Potential friend.</p><p>It was then that Copycat knew that she'd have  to kill Nabiki before she'd be able to get near Ranma.</p><p>Copycat smiled and said, "I guess I might as  well get this check up over with." Tofu had since come out of the office and he  and Hoko's mother exchanged some mindless pleasantries, before Tofu invited her  and Copycat into his office, apologizing for the state of the room.</p><p>Copycat wasn't worried about being found out.  The demon cloth made Copycat a perfect copy of Hoko's body, including basic ki  flow patterns. After a period of time, Copycat's own distinct ki pattern would  start to become more visible, but by that time it would be attributed to  changes in lifestyle.</p><p>Hoko's mother explained how she was worried  her daughter might have been possessed by something, but she was sure it was  nothing now and was sorry to take up Dr. Tofu's time.</p><p>Tofu simply nodded and examined Copycat,  prodding certain spots and seeming to gaze through her.</p><p>The problem with simply walking up to Ranma  and slitting his throat when he least suspected it was that Ranma seemed to  suspect it <i>all the time</i>. Ranma could  detect things, dodge things, and anticipate things to the point where it was  uncanny. Copycat had once, in the form of Ryoga, tried to kill Ranma in his  sleep, only to have every attempt thwarted by a dodge. Copycat was almost  certain Ranma had some kind of latent precognitive ability.</p><p>Ranma had his weaknesses, but he also had an  annoying tendency to let everyone know what he was doing. Even if he could be  goaded into a trap, it wouldn't matter because he'd say "Uh oh! Looks like I'm  walking into a trap!" and his allies would eventually find out and rescue him.</p><p>Copycat had no allies.</p><p>In order to defeat Ranma, she had to rectify  that situation. It was a long, arduous task to make new associations, she knew  this from experience. Nabiki already had allies, it  would be far easier to just steal hers.</p><p>Tofu said that he could see nothing abnormal  in the ki flow patterns and started with the physical check up. He asked  Copycat to turn her head and cough. She did.</p><p>Copycat's next victim had been a Japanese  Language teacher. A single, middle-aged woman named Tanaka Kimiko. This time,  Copycat was extra careful to get the personality down. She found the camera  that stole abilities worked for personalities as well and it was fairly easy to  fool the woman's students. It was considerably harder to stab the woman  repeatedly with a tanto, stuff her in the trunk of her own car, drive some  three hours into the countryside where no one was around, saw her up into segments  and throw them into separate dumpsters as she traveled back to Tokyo.</p><p>Copycat used her position as one of Nabiki's  teachers to try to get some information on the girl. The thing was, Nabiki really didn't have any enemies. Many people did not  particularly like her, but almost everyone Copycat overheard in the halls  regarded her with a respect that bordered on worship. Once, while Copycat sat  in the school office, Nabiki came in to see the assistant principal. Copycat  listened in. Nabiki was saying that there ought to be a school wide martial  arts tournament to raise money for the repairs to the gym that Ranma had  damaged in his fight with Hinako-sensei.</p><p>The tournament was held two weeks later.</p><p>Nabiki was not infallible. She hadn't  suspected anything of Copycat as she taught in the guise of Tanaka Kimiko, and  while she got impeccable grades, Nabiki still made mistakes. She still mistook  one complex kanji for another or turned papers in late same as anybody else.  There was the occasional student who claimed to have won a heap of money off  Nabiki in the betting pool. And the tournament had of course been a complete  disaster. But the girl knew things. She got things done. And she was fair.</p><p>The only possible chinks in her armor were  her two closest friends, Inamura Yuki and Tomo Hoko.  Yuki was extremely popular. She was friends with Nabiki in a large part because  Nabiki kept Kuno from realizing that fact. Yuki had many friends aside from  Nabiki and furthermore, her father was a police detective; so she wouldn't work  for Copycat's purposes.</p><p>Hoko, on the other hand, was a loner. A  nondescript wall flower who worked for the school newspaper and wrote ho hum  articles about things people already knew with pictures that everyone had  already seen. She wasn't an outcast or anything; she just kept to herself and  didn't make any waves. She was perfect. But if Copycat was going to get so  close to Nabiki, she had to make sure she had Hoko down perfectly. Luckily,  there was one pathetic kid who no one really liked and who had almost every  class with the girl.</p><p>So Copycat made as if she were retiring from  teaching and moving to far away lands, and then set about killing Gosunkugi Hikari.</p><p>"I don't see anything wrong, Tomo-san. Your  daughter is just a perfectly normal, healthy, teenage girl."</p><p>Copycat got up off the examination table as  Tofu had Hoko's mother sign some papers so he could get paid from the insurance  company. Then he walked her and Copycat out of the office, whereupon he and  Hoko's mother exchanged a few more mindless pleasantries, which Copycat tuned  out, until Tofu turned to her smiling and saying "...and you, young lady. You  make sure not to kill your mother in her sleep okay?"</p><p>"Um...right..." Copycat replied. She glanced  at Tomo's pained expression and was grateful that she hadn't been the only one  who thought Tofu's comment unfunny. She wondered just how much Tofu was hiding.  He had the stink of Ijuu, but he behaved so  innocuously... Maybe his remark was just an attempt at humor, but if it was,  then perhaps Ranma wasn't the only one with latent precognitive abilities.</p><p>Just then, Ukyo and Shampoo came in  hesitantly from outside. From their body language, Copycat figured they had  somehow put aside differences and were now friends. Ukyo seemed almost  protective of Shampoo, so Copycat guessed something had happened to the Amazon  and Ukyo had consoled her. Shampoo's hair was cut as if by a knife, which meant  she had either left the Amazons, or she had an unfortunate run in with Ryoga.</p><p>Copycat's eyebrow went up with interest at this turn of events.</p><p>When Ranma turned to see Shampoo she turned into a he and  jumped...no... pounced on top of her, making a  horrible rowrling...</p><p>"Ranchan! What the  HELL?" Ukyo screamed</p><p>Shampoo screamed too but it wasn't quite a  scream or even human sound.</p><p>Nabiki got up out of her seat on the couch,  her jaw open eyes blinking.</p><p>Genma jumped up and flattened himself against  the wall while Soun just sat stunned.</p><p>Kasumi ran to Tofu's side and looked  worriedly up at him, but all he could manage in response to the situation was a  visible gulp.</p><p>Ranma tore through Shampoo's cheongsam with  invisible claws. One breast and upper thigh of the Chinese girl now showed. It  was making Copycat excited and she started breathing exercises so she could  enjoy the view without revealing herself.</p><p>Shampoo whirled around and faced Ranma on all  fours. She hissed and it was a cat sound only larger, louder. That same sound  that made a small furry creature a source of fear now made this buxom girl from  China positively terrifying.</p><p>Ranma was not dissuaded. He attempted to  circle around Shampoo, but the girl shuffled to face him. Nabiki moved closer  to Ranma holding a hand out hesitantly. "Ranma...she...she doesn't want to mate  with you."</p><p>Ranma whipped around. "What would you know of  it, HUMAN?"  Ranma turned back toward  Shampoo but she was gone through the door, which she ripped apart in her  escape. Without a second thought, Ranma bounded after her followed by Ukyo...  and Nabiki.</p><p>Copycat wanted to applaud. Instead, she  looked up at Hoko's mother and lied, "Mom, is it all right if you go home  without me? I'm going to see if I can help Nabiki." Not waiting for the Tomo  woman to respond, Copycat ran out and, when she was sure no one could see her,  jumped onto the roof of a nearby building and continued after the three girls  and Ranma.</p><p>She considered the possibility of being seen.  Most people didn't know Hoko, but if Nabiki found out, she would have  questions. On the other hand, Nabiki seemed rather preoccupied and was unlikely  to be looking above her. The alternative was to use the demon cloth to change  forms, but the only form she knew that would make sense would be Mousse and he  was probably at the Nekohanten, which might cause some question-raising if  there were reports of him being in two places at once. Also, in order to change  back to Hoko, she would have to study a photo of her, as she had only changed  into her once. Finally, if worse came to worse Copycat could always invent secret  martial arts training for Hoko. So Hoko she would remain. She bounded over a  gap between roofs. She was catching up to Nabiki and Ukyo but the "cats" were  still far ahead.</p><p>She brought her camera out of null space and  put her head through the strap, still holding on to it with her right hand as  she ran to keep it from banging all over the place. She would get to Ranma  eventually. The Nekoken was one of Ranma's most powerful techniques and soon,  it would be hers.</p><p>Akane asked for hot tea with her parfait. As soon as she had,  P-chan started squirming. <i>He must be  uncomfortable </i>Akane surmised, and adjusted her hold on the piglet. After  she had her ice cream she would see the transformation first hand. Right now  she wasn't ready for another blast to her worldview.</p><p>She sat down at a booth next to the window. Across the street she  could see the Hot Dog and Coffee, a neat little café owned by a gaijin. She saw  the owner walk out of the building and lean on the wall, lighting up a  cigarette.</p><p>Akane took a spoonful of ice cream and put it in her mouth,  watching the man. "I wonder what his story is." Akane  muttered. "Did he ever love anybody? Does he know what it's like? Knowing that  the one you love will never love you, but not being able to change? Not being  able to learn how to cope with it?" Akane looked down at P-chan, "And you... I  know you're Ryoga. But...I just can't picture it. It just doesn't seem right  somehow."</p><p>P-chan bweed in  astonishment.</p><p>Akane smiled, "I guess you want some ice cream too huh? Okay here  you go!" Akane spoon-fed P-chan.  "It's  funny. You've been sleeping with me for months now. If I thought for one second  you were really Ryoga I'd probably be eating a ham sandwich right now.  But that's just it. I <i>know</i> you're Ryoga...but all I can see is P-chan. It's all so  confusing!" Akane's fist clenched. "What did I do to deserve this? Honestly!"  She took several spoonfuls of parfait in quick succession.</p><p>She took a slower bite pensively as a knot grew in her throat.  "There I go again. Typhoon Akane.  Let me just get angry at things, that will  make them better! DAMMIT!" She slammed her fist on the table, startling some of  the other customers. "I can't help it though! It's that shampoo. Shampoo's  shampoo! It's all that bimbo's fault, no...it's all  RANMA'S fault!"</p><p>P-chan bweed in  sympathetic anger.</p><p>"Another spoonful? Okay." Akane fed the pig again. "Why  can't I stop? Ranma didn't know about the side affects of a double dose of that  stuff...But...arghh! It has to be the shampoo again!  I can't even get it through my head that I've got a problem huh? Honestly! You  aren't even a real pig!"  Impulsively  Akane grabbed her Styrofoam cup of tea and splashed it on P-chan, feeling silly  even as she did it.</p><p>Suddenly she had a very nude Ryoga sitting in her lap. "PERVERT!" Akane yelled and malleted  Ryoga into the ceiling, which he bounced off  of, landing rather harshly on the thin padding of the booth seat.</p><p>"Ow," Ryoga said simply.</p><p>"I'm sorry Ryoga! I should have known you wouldn't have any  clothes!"</p><p>"It's okay," Ryoga muttered nevously.  When he sat up again he was clothed in his usual attire and he had his hand  back behind his head. "I learned a few things from Mousse."</p><p>Akane nodded still a little stunned. "You're...you're P-chan?"</p><p>"Yes." Ryoga looked seriously into Akane's eyes.  "You don't know how long I've wanted to tell  you, Akane! But Ranma always kept me from letting you know! And it was so nice,  sleeping in your bed...I mean..."</p><p>"When were you sleeping in my BED?" Akane started to feel her  anger rising, and then took a breath. "You mean P-chan. P-chan slept with me. Arrgh!"</p><p>"This is all Ranma's fault." Ryoga assured. "You need to cure  yourself and then get back at him somehow. I could help you train..."</p><p>"You would do that, Ryoga? That would be great! But...I don't  think I could actually fight Ranma. He's mean, but I still...I've got to get  cured. I want these feelings to go away." Akane looked outside at the people  entering the Hot Dog and Coffee. "Really, if I didn't lo...like Ranma...I don't  think I'd want anything to do with him."</p><p>"You mean...you wouldn't want revenge? Not at  all?"</p><p>"I don't know, Ryoga. I'm just tired of it all. I've fought Ranma  for every little thing for so long...and really it was only because he can get  so close to me. Get under my skin. It's really because I like him that I get so  angry at him. If I could stop...if I could just realize that there is no way  Ranma will ever like me back..." Akane smiled sadly.  "I probably have about as much chance of getting Ranma to love me as you do  now."</p><p>"Wha?"</p><p>"Hmph. I guess self doubt was something I was  good at before Shampoo." Akane got up and put some coins on the table as a tip.  "I'm going home to pack. I've got to get away. Yuka was right. You're really a  nice guy, Ryoga. Maybe once I get cured we can get together again...If I don't  beat you to a pulp."  With that Akane  left Ryoga to sit at the booth alone.</p><p>Ryoga felt rather odd. He felt closer to Akane than ever before,  but why did there seem to be something missing now? Why did Akane's proposition  of getting back together make him nervous instead of excited? Why was Ranma  chasing Shampoo on all fours outside the window? "Ranma, that  bastard! Going after Shampoo now! That's it,  I'm going to kill him!"</p><p>"<i>I've  fought Ranma for every little thing for so long...and really it was only  because he can get so close to me. Get under my skin. It's really because I  like him that I get so angry at him."</i></p><p>Ryoga shuddered. Every now and then Akane gave him the creeps. It  wasn't how she was so blithely violent all the time, or how she nearly crushed  him whenever he slept with her as P-chan, that just made him a little nervous.  No, what scared Ryoga about Akane was that sometimes, staring into her angry brown  eyes, he felt like he was staring at a distorted image of himself.</p><p>He shook his head. "No. Ranma's my sworn enemy. I do NOT like  her...him!"</p><p>The waitress came by to pick up the money and the empty parfait  glass. She patted Ryoga on the shoulder, "You aren't fooling anybody, honey.  Would you like anything?"</p><p>"N...no. I'm going to leave." Nodding at his own declaration, Ryoga got up and left the building.</p><p>Yes, it was definitely time to get lost.</p><p>Ukyo should have done something...but it  all happened so <i>fast.</i> She hadn't even  considered the possibility that Ranma was at the clinic. She just thought Tofu  could help Shampoo somehow. That maybe there was a pressure point that  diminished sexuality or something. And when it happened...Ukyo had believed  Shampoo, but it hadn't been <i>real</i> to  her until it was right in front of her. Her friendship to Shampoo was so new,  and already Ukyo felt like she had betrayed it. And so she ran after her and  Ranma. But they were so much faster. Both of them.</p><p>Ukyo heard the sound of shoes behind her, and  she glanced back. Nabiki was running too! Even in her short glance though, she  could tell Nabiki wasn't fit enough to run even the distance she already had.</p><p>Ukyo fell back, allowing Nabiki to catch up.  "Why are <i>you</i> running?"</p><p>"Ranma...might kill...if...I...don't... stop  him...Go back to Tofu's...get help."</p><p>"Sugar, you aren't going to make another ten  feet, there's no way you'll catch up to them."</p><p>"I'll...catch up...you...go."</p><p>Ukyo just ran beside Nabiki. To her surprise  the Tendo girl started picking up speed. "Nabiki, how-?"</p><p>"GO!" Nabiki waved her hand at Ukyo to go  back...or at least that was what Ukyo thought she was doing until she felt a  sharp burning pain. The chef slowed to a stop as she examined the four parallel  tears in the arm of her boy's school uniform. She looked up at Nabiki who had  already gained an uncanny amount of ground. She was bounding on all fours,  catlike.</p><p>"This is fast becoming an epidemic," Ukyo  remarked to herself. The statement didn't begin to cover the strangeness of  seeing the Ice Queen run off like that though.</p><p>"Hey you!"</p><p>Ukyo turned to see a rather unkempt and  rotund man with curly black hair and a moustache standing outside the door of  the Hot Dog and Coffee. "Me?"</p><p>"Yeah. You wanna buy a hot dog?"</p><p>"No thanks, sugar," Ukyo said, "I'm trying to  quit." In Ukyo's opinion, the worst thing a person could do with a piece of  meat was turn it into a hot dog.</p><p>"Heh heh.  Fine suit yourself. I just know that after <i>I</i>  see three teenagers run past me on all fours after each other, a nice, normal  hot dog sure sounds good."</p><p>Ukyo had to admit she was tempted, but she  had somewhere she had to be. "Maybe some other time.  You've got an effective sales strategy there."</p><p>The man shrugged. "Hey, this is Nerima."</p><p>"That it is," Ukyo agreed with a sigh. "Take  care." And with that she ran back toward Tofu's.</p><p>Nabiki wasn't sure at first why she followed  Ranma out the torn down door of the Tofu clinic. It wasn't something she would  normally do. Normally she'd acknowledge that Ukyo was the most qualified to  defuse the situation and make sure she was prepared for every foreseeable  eventuality.  But something told her Ukyo  wouldn't be able to fix this. That only she could.</p><p>She hadn't done much aerobic exercise in the  decade or so since she stopped practicing the Art, and she felt it as she  pounded the ground with her feet after the others. In her mind though, she kept  seeing Genma at the mercy of invisible claws... Over and over like a sports  broadcast that was too enthused about its instant replay feature she saw the  image. And she remembered the power, the freedom...By the time Ukyo fell back  to talk to her, Nabiki was half-crazed from exhaustion and almost the rest of  the way crazed by something inside her telling her she could be faster, she  could be stronger...</p><p>Nabiki struggled desperately against this.  She recognized the voice inside her, felt it as the cool weight of a pistol in  her palm...it wasn't any different than that. But unlike a pistol she couldn't  throw this away, she could not renounce it like a bad habit and be done. It was  as much a part of her now as it had ever been for Ranma.</p><p>It wasn't until she involuntarily scratched Ukyo's arm though,  that Nabiki understood. She had power, whether she liked it or not. The only  thing she had any influence on was how she used it. She had to find some way to  control it and there was really only one way to learn.</p><p>Nabiki stopped resisting.</p><p>Immediately the world became a wash of  sounds, smells, sensations... the bloody sweet sweat tang of Shampoo's menses  attacked her nostrils immediately. As she concentrated she could discern  Ranma's pleasant musk. She heard Ukyo talk with somebody far behind her but the  words held no real meaning any more. She knew she was now running on all fours,  but found it so natural she wondered why she didn't run that way all the time.</p><p>Then she wondered why she was running in the  first place when, even now, she was so close to utter exhaustion. So Ranma  wished to mate with the other female. What was the problem? It was her time,  was it not? Ranma could mate with Nabiki when it was her own time. It was  natural for the female to fight off the male at first. If she reached them  she'd only be interfering in what might be a happy copulation. But then she had  a thought...</p><p><i>Ranma, Shampoo and I have  human bodies. </i></p><p>Nabiki increased her speed, trying not to  notice her ugly, pink, hairless hands as they pushed away the concrete  underneath her...tried not to get frustrated at not being able to direct her  hearing with her atrophied stumps of ears. Ranma being human and one with honor, would not copulate with another if he had a litter by  Shampoo. If she let Ranma mate with Shampoo, she could lose him forever. Nabiki  would not let that happen.</p><p>Ranma was hers.</p><p>Kawagami Hiro knew he should have known  better. The girl was still in High School, and she was a reckless driver on top  of it. But he had fallen for her.</p><p>The way she moved on that bike, it was like  she was one with it! He helped save her life, and while at the time he was too  worried she might die to pay much attention, now he could not quite get the  feeling of her lips on his to go away, even as he sipped black java at the Hot  Dog and Coffee, remembering the image of her and that punk kid making out on  the couch of Tofu's waiting room. The Hot Dog and Coffee was a favorite hang  out for cops, first because of the coffee, and secondly because you could see all  the girls coming out of the Sanjuuichi ice cream shop  across the street.</p><p>"Why so glum, chum?" asked Inamura Kentaro as he sat down across the table from Hiro.  He had an extremely well-kept goatee that, combined with his oriental features,  made one think simultaneously of Don Quixote and Kublai Khan. He tended to have  more Quixote than Khan in him most times. People often wondered at how such an  ebullient man could be a homicide detective, but he was, and he had definite  limits to his pleasantness.</p><p>"It's this girl I gave a ticket to. Saved her life. She didn't even thank me and she was banging  this punk..."</p><p>"Hiro, Hiro, Hiro...you're like one of the  women in the self defense class! You keep trying to save these girls, trying to  change them but you can't. You can't ask a tiger to be a lamb."</p><p>"This girl was different. She  was intelligent, I could tell...and there was something else..."<br/>"There all different. They're  like snowflakes, but Hiro," Kentaro winked and glanced out at the Sanjuuichi meaningfully "They all taste the same on the  tongue."</p><p>"Yeah, I know. I just thought going back to  being a traffic cop would keep me from having to deal with... women. And this  one hit me harder than the others." Hiro sighed, "So you have any gruesome  murders to lift my spirits?"</p><p>"Heh. As a matter of fact... I was about to ask you to do me a  favor."<br/>Hiro had a good idea what it was, "You  know, contrary to popular belief, Kentaro, I don't actually <i>like</i> giving people bad news."</p><p>"But you're so <i>good</i> at it!" Kentaro batted Hiro lightly on the side of the head.</p><p>Hiro was caught in a disturbing niche of  being one of the few cops that didn't absolutely dread telling people their  friends or family members were dead. He wasn't an especially morbid guy, far  from it. It was just that he'd rather someone hear it from him than a  pimple-faced rookie or a callous veteran of the force. He wouldn't want cheery  bright-eyed Kentaro to do it; that was for sure. Hiro sighed, "Okay, so who is  it?"</p><p>"It's a murder. A grisly  one at that. Not one of those nice induced heart attacks no siree." Kentaro's voice had taken  a slightly manic tone. This case had upset Kentaro more than usual. He was  venting.  "This one all we got is a  maggot infested arm that fell out of a dumpster about five o'clock this morning. We got the torso an hour  or so later, so we ruled out self-amputation. We ran the prints...they belong  to an eighteen-year-old girl. Maybe one of your waifs?..."</p><p>Hiro tried not to think of Nabiki hacked into  pieces. It was common knowledge troubled teens tended to have a short shelf  life. But Hiro had been a troubled teen not all that long ago and Kentaro's humor hit a little too close to home.</p><p>The older cop continued, "She came by just  three days ago to get her motorcycle license renewal signed by a notary  public." Kentaro's face suddenly lost its brightness.</p><p>Hiro knew he was thinking about the murderer,  about catching the bastard, about how fucked the judicial system was that let  maniacs like that loose even after they were caught, about how it could have  been his own daughter that had been killed.</p><p>"Tomo Hoko, that's the name of the victim."  Kentaro took in a breath leaning back to gaze into the fluorescent light over  head, "Alas, poor Hoko," he said and lowered his head to look at Hiro with  smile as natural as a skeleton's and about as cheerful, "I knew her, Horatio."</p><p>"Give me the address, and I'll take care of  it." Hiro said solemnly.</p><p>Kentaro handed him a copy of Hoko's file. He  got up to leave and turned back, "I knew her." He left then, and Hiro knew that  the man would be relentless in tracking the murderer down. Kentaro was in full  Kublai Khan mode now, and for him, the divine wind was  on his side.</p><p>Hiro looked at the address on the file and  shot to his feet. Tomo Hoko was Nabiki's next door neighbor! He ran to see if  he could catch Kentaro, but he was distracted by someone turning up the volume  on a TV in the café. "Hey check it out!" the fat, curly-haired man said.</p><p>A four way intersection  blocked by a naked couple having sex. They seemed to be making high  pitched cat sounds. Hiro didn't really think when he saw the image. He just  went out of the room, out of the building and onto his bike.</p><p>When Akane entered the building dressed in  her yellow gi and carrying a backpack on her back, a man in long, white robes  embraced her.</p><p>"SHAMPOO, MY LOVE!"</p><p><i>   The Nekohanten,</i>  Akane thought sardonically, <i>they may not  know your name, but they're always glad you came.</i> Akane pried Mousse's arms  from her torso as best she could, explaining, "I'm not Shampoo, Mousse.  Honestly!"</p><p>Just then, Akane noticed the TV mounted on  the wall...</p><p><i>   "...Amazingly, instead of running over them, the first cars were blown  back by some form of energy. Police officers are having difficulty getting to  the scene owing to the sheer magnitude of the traffic jam the two love birds  have caused. This just in! The names of the exhibitionists are Saotome Ranma  and...CRASHsizzlepop"</i></p><p>Akane extricated her mallet from the  television only a little self conscious.</p><p>"Hey! We were watching that!" one of the  Nekohanten customers exclaimed.</p><p>Ignoring them, Akane turned to Mousse. "Is Cologne here?"</p><p>Mousse put his glasses back onto his nose  from the top of his head. "I'll take you to her." Mousse led her to the back of  the restaurant, where Cologne was standing on the counter, hovering  over a large pot of ramen. "Old ha...I mean Honored Elder?" Mousse bowed, "You  have a visitor."</p><p>She turned and saw Akane. "Ah yes, Tendo  Akane!" She picked up her staff and hopped to the floor and then on to the top  of the staff balancing on its tip. "You've been through a lot today, child.  Feel free to let go of your pack and sit. May I ask where it is you're going?"</p><p>Akane set her pack down and sat on it. Her eyes  were now level with the Amazon elder's. "I'm going to a friend's house for the  weekend. I need...distance."</p><p>Cologne nodded, "You did leave a note, right?  You mustn't let your family worry."</p><p>"Yes, I left a note telling them where I'll  be and I plan on calling as soon as I get there."</p><p>"Good. You'll need as few distractions as  possible the next few days or so."</p><p>"You have what I called about?"</p><p>Cologne brought a bottle of formula 119 shampoo "Yes, I have your cure, and I appreciate you telling  me about Shampoo."</p><p>"Forgive me, Cologne-sama,  but I thought you'd be more upset about that."</p><p>"Phah, I was the  same as her back in my day. The truth is the Amazon culture can be a little  stifling. If you don't rebel every now and then, you wither up and die.  Shampoo's biggest fault was that she was too willing to follow orders. If she  had just stayed in Japan to begin with, she'd be married to Ranma  right now."</p><p>Akane couldn't suppress a twitch in her  eyebrow but managed to stay calm. "So you think she'll come back to you?"</p><p>"I know she'll come back, child. Whether she  wants to or not. It's her destiny."</p><p>"Destiny? It can't  be changed?"</p><p>"Some things cannot be changed, child. We all  grow old, we all die, the day inevitably darkens into  night. Other things...they are as mercurial as a flame in the wind. This thing with Nabiki for instance. You know I wasn't  expecting it at all? And now it seems like it should have been obvious. But to  say that was destiny is an anthropomorphic fallacy. We try to make reality more  human, because we can deal with people; we know how they operate. If this  didn't happen, if that didn't happen...we start to wonder how it is that all  these things were set up. We start to think of it as the fates playing with us.  But the very nature of the word "if" should clue us in that there isn't a plan.  You could just as easily be married to Ranma right now. So could Shampoo or  Ukyo or nearly anybody. A billion random events conspired against you. A  butterfly flapped its wings."</p><p>"So I still don't have any control." Akane  said bitterly.</p><p>"Of course you have control! You are yourself  part of the world you live in! You can affect it just as surely as it can  affect you. You already do in fact, you just don't realize it because you don't  observe. Do you know what the most awesome power in all of  the universe is?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"The power of thyself  known. If you know absolutely everything there is to know about  yourself, then you can do almost anything given enough time. Case in point, if  you knew that you had been affected by the formula 110 shampoo earlier, you  would have gone to me or Tofu earlier and perhaps none of this mess would have  happened. But instead of being in control, you were controlled, and so in a  way, it's all your fault."</p><p>"I don't see how I could have known..."</p><p>"But you did know. You knew the first day  that something was wrong, but you dismissed it. Of course, if everyone in the  world stopped dismissing things, the world would be a lot less interesting."</p><p>"I suppose you're right," Akane sighed.</p><p>"Of course I am." Cologne crossed her arms, managing to stay  balanced on her staff by her feet alone. "Have you made a decision?"</p><p>Akane nodded.</p><p>"So, would you like to be an Amazon?"</p><p>"Yes. Yes, I would, Honored Elder."<br/>Cologne smiled. "I'm pleased. Your training  starts Monday. And don't think you're going to get out of paying for that  television. Tomorrow I will go with you to your school so you can get a work  permit. I imagine your grades have suffered a bit."</p><p>"But, Honored Elder?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"The cure?"<br/>"I've already administered it. You'll  be back to full capacity in just under three hours."</p><p>Akane blinked. She hadn't even seen the old  woman move! "Will I ever learn to be that fast?" she wondered out loud.</p><p>"You will learn many things. Your mind is  free now, and the chains it has worn have served to strengthen it. Just be sure  not to squander this opportunity."</p><p>Akane nodded, smiling. She could feel it now,  like a fog slowly lifting from her mind. Like static she hadn't even realized  was there fading into a clear picture. She didn't need Ranma. If he and Nabiki  wanted to screw in a city street then that was their business. Akane was  finally through for real. Besides, Ranma didn't deserve her. She was Tendo  Akane.</p><p>She was Amazon.</p><p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~</p><p>AN: In case  you're wondering about the title and/or about Copycat's inside joke, it all  revolves around knowing that "fetch" is another name for a doppelganger, or a  creature that mimics people and then kills them. I always planned on having  Copycat Ken in this fic. I wasn't satisfied with the ending of the episode, and  really there's no character that I know of with more of an identity crisis.  Seeing as he was able to turn himself into a perfect copy of Happosai, someone  much smaller than his normal form, I figure the blanket he uses is more than  just illusion.</p><p>Slowly but  surely the fic is approaching the main arc. Believe it or not, it actually  centers on Nodoka, and she should finally make an appearance in the next  chapter. Unless my idea monster rears its complicated head  again of course.</p><p>Many  thanks to Figment, Bastet's Chosen, and Aondehafka for  their help with this chapter and to The Wanderer and the people at the FFML for  helping with a technical problem.</p><p>Feedback greatly  appreciated.</p><p>It gets weirder.</p>
