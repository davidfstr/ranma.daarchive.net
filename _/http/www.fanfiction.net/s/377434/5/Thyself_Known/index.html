</div><p>Thyself Known</p><p>Ch.5: Firefly</p><p>By Zorknot</p><p>DISCLAIMER:  Ranma1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi and her cohorts.</p><p>WHAT  HAS COME BEFORE: Nabiki just had an accident while being chased by the cops.  Apparently she used a ki blast to deflect t a flying motorcycle before it hit a  woman and her infant husband. She used too much ki, and now she's ringing  Death's doorbell. Ranma is trying to save her by putting on some pretty  earrings and pretending to be Nabiki so that he give  Nabiki a complete ki transfusion without it being rejected. Seems farfetched,  but Ranma and Nabiki have more in common than one might suspect...</p><p>~~~~~[BEGIN]~~~~~</p><p><i>"Boy,<br/>I've seen through all your schemes.<br/>Poor boy,<br/>You're just a bag of empty dreams.<br/>Oh boy,<br/>I've been nasty, you've been kind.<br/>You've sold your soul, but I still got mine<br/>And I got you covered."</i></p><p><i>-Biff Rose fr.  I Got You Covered.</i></p><p>"So I'm really Ranma, and in order to save my  real self I have to participate in this ki transfusion?" Nabiki asked. It was  kind of hard to take, but seeing herself on the table as a police officer tried  to resuscitate her... and the red pigtail she was sporting complete with black  T-shirt and Chinese pants did a lot to convince her.</p><p>"Yes, we don't have much time" Tofu said  tersely.</p><p>Nabiki nodded slowly. Whole swatches of her  memory were gone. She knew for instance her mother was dead, but not how, or  even what her name was. She knew she was Akane and Kasumi's sister, but she  couldn't remember either of them younger than they were now.</p><p>Except Akane. She  seemed to remember Akane at five or so, but the memory was indistinct. She  thought of Ranma, of when she first saw him. Of all the times she helped him  out...She never made it easy for him of course, but she respected him after a  fact. Ranma had earned that respect. Nabiki had done a lot to harm Ranma too,  but the boy survived it all and saved her little sister several times.  Sometimes she had the feeling she respected Ranma more than anyone else in her  family, which was odd because she didn't even really like him all that much. He  was just fun to tease. All her respect amounted to was that she rarely bet  against him and enlisted his aid upon occasion. Compared to what Akane did to  him this morning though...</p><p>A jolt passed through Nabiki. She wasn't sure  what it was but she knew it was a memory. A memory of something terrible she  did in the past that she tried desperately to forget...</p><p>But if she was Ranma...Whose memory was it?  How could she remember even what she did? How much of herself  was real? Tofu said the other Nabiki had been driving a motorcycle after all  and Nabiki couldn't remember even owning one... An image flashed in her mind of  eyes. Sad, angry, dark eyes...It was from this morning, but she couldn't tell  for a moment whether it was her eyes looking into Ranma's, or Ranma's looking  into hers.</p><p>Nabiki swallowed, "Okay...what do I have to  do?"</p><p>Tofu took Nabiki to a bed that he had moved  right next to...the other Nabiki's bed so that they touched end to end. "Lay  down here, your cosmic consciousness centers need to be close together."</p><p>Nabiki did as Doctor Tofu asked. If she  looked up now, laying down, she could see the top of  her own head. Thinking about it, it made sense. The crown chakra, located on  the top of the head, was supposed to govern identity, of who a person is to  themselves and the universe. Maybe that was what Tofu was talking about with  the cosmic consciousness centers. Nabiki frowned. She should have known that  already. She was a master yogi.</p><p>Nabiki mentally slapped herself. She was  Ranma. Ranma had probably trained in yoga some time but then abandoned it for  other things. And of course he knew about Nabiki because he had caught her in  the dojo that one time, performing a difficult asana. But Nabiki couldn't  imagine abandoning yoga. Couldn't imagine a life without  meditation.</p><p>Or could she?</p><p>Nabiki was perfectly willing to admit at this  point that she was certifiably insane, but she was still Nabiki. She simply  could not let go of that. And she would not. Not until this mess was cleared up  anyway.</p><p>"Okay  now, reach up and touch Nabiki's temples with your fingers."</p><p>Tofu could be so irritating at times...It was  like he always said the wrong thing...on purpose. Letting it pass Nabiki closed  her eyes, reached both hands up and after hitting ears and hairline she found  the temples.</p><p>"You  can stop now, Kawagami-san. If this doesn't work...it won't matter." Tofu  addressed the police officer. Who then reluctantly left the other Nabiki's side. "Okay...now I'm going to have to press a few pressure  points to start the flow of ki. You will feel very  disoriented for a bit, but you must not panic okay?"</p><p>"I  understand."</p><p>"And,  Ranma, if you're listening in there...I just want you to know that whatever  happens...As far as I'm concerned this proves you are a man among men."</p><p>Nabiki smirked, yes she was definitely going  to have to clear Ranma's debts after he saved her life, but she was sure she  could still find a way to milk him later. And of course since she really WAS  Ranma, he must know it as well as her...Nabiki frowned. She hoped this would  get settled soon. It was all just too strange.</p><p>Nabiki felt Tofu press a few spots on her  arms and throat...and things started to get even stranger.</p><p>"That  irresponsible, inconsiderate, idiotic, no good, perverted JERK!" Akane slammed  her fist down on her desk.</p><p>It was lunchtime and Sayuri and Yuka were  eating their lunches around Akane in the classroom. "What did he do this time?"  Yuka asked politely while exchanging glances with Sayuri.</p><p>It was an innocent question, but it was  exactly what Akane had been trying to avoid all morning. What DID Ranma do? Why  could she not spend five minutes with him without blowing up? "I don't know,"  she said in a small voice.</p><p>"What?"  Sayuri asked, surprised. "Come on he had to have done SOMETHING to get you this  upset!"</p><p>"It's  nothing...or maybe it's everything. Damn it why isn't he HERE!"</p><p>"Okay  Akane, just tell us what happened, maybe that will help you feel better." Yuka  suggested, Sayuri nodding her on.</p><p>Akane looked at her friends, "I'm sorry you  guys, I know you have your own problems. It's not right for me to unload on you  all the time."</p><p>"Oh  that's alright, Akane I don't mind." Yuka said.</p><p>"Heh  yeah," Sayuri smirked, "Besides your problems are MUCH more interesting."</p><p>"That's  right! Just yesterday I couldn't find my book bag and I was so stressed! And  then I thought 'well at least I don't have an aquatransexual babe magnet for a  boyfriend' and you know what? I felt SO much better!" Yuka agreed.</p><p>"He is  NOT my boyfriend."</p><p>"Whatever!"  Sayuri and Yuka said in chorus and then erupted into laughter.</p><p>Akane couldn't help smiling.</p><p>"Behold!"  Yuka said as she stood up and gestured to Akane's face, "Amateresu has come out  of her cave! Let us rejoice!"</p><p>Akane found herself giggling. "Yuka stop! You  sound like Kuno!"</p><p>Yuka pointed a finger at Akane in mock  challenge. "You take that back right now, Tendo!"</p><p>"Akane,  I think what Yuka is trying to say is 'Forsooth! Speakest  thou not this slander, woman!'"</p><p>They all started giggling at this. When they  were through Akane sighed still smiling. "Thanks you guys...I  needed a good laugh today."</p><p>Sayuri gave a concerned look, "Yeah, no  problem, Akane...so why were you so upset at Ranma?"</p><p>Akane sighed. "It's not really him...Ranma's  an idiot sometimes, but really he's nice enough when he wants to be."</p><p>"Well  than what is it?" Yuka asked. She had just finished her bento and now she  folded her hand in front of her and sat up, her long brown hair framing a face  of undivided attention.</p><p>Akane hated it when Yuka did that. "Its not him its...her."</p><p>"What?"  Sayuri asked around a bite of rice before swallowing it.</p><p>"Ranma's girl side." Akane took a drink of her soda.  "Before...it wasn't a big deal, but now his mother's been coming over more often...  sometimes for whole weeks and...well...it frustrates  me."</p><p>"Is it  just that he has to act like a girl?" Sayuri asked.</p><p>"No...it's not that really..."</p><p>"Is it  how he treats his mother?" Yuka asked.</p><p>Akane hesitated. "Th- that's part of it. But I understand that sort  of. I mean...I would do almost anything to see Mom again...but I don't think I  could actually kill myself. Sometimes I wonder though...anyway I don't think  Auntie Saotome would make him do that, but Ranma's father does. Ranma's  actually tried to tell his mother a few times and Uncle stopped him...Sometimes  I forget how complicated it all is...Sometimes I wonder what I'd really do. I  don't really blame Ranma for acting like a girl when his mother's  around...but...it's just...he's too good at it!"</p><p>"Honey,  are you SURE he's not gay?" Sayuri asked, "I mean let's review here: he looks  great, he doesn't respond well to come ons, he  worries about his clothes, he can't stand a messy room AND he cross  dresses...color me ignorant but that sounds like a fag to me." Sayuri counted  the points of on her fingers as she sat with her legs crossed in a laid back  slouch that somehow came off as attractive. Not that Akane would think she was  attractive...</p><p>Akane shook her head free of the thought. "I  told you, Sayuri, he's not gay. We've had...moments."</p><p>"Moments." Sayuri repeated.</p><p>"Come  on, I told you!"</p><p>"All I  remember is once he held your hand and a few times he ALMOST was going to kiss  you. That hardly seems like clinching proof to me."</p><p>"He  said I had a cute smile..."</p><p>"Akane,"  Sayuri patted Akane's hand, "lots of gay guys say things like that."</p><p>Akane sighed, "I'm beginning to think maybe  you're right."</p><p>"Oh  this is great!" Yuka laughed breaking out of her "proper" mode. "You two should  start a gay boyfriend club, get shirts made up!"</p><p>"Shut  up, Yuka. Shiunji may have been gay, but he was much  better boyfriend material than that slob you're into now, what's his name?  Haisetsubutsu?"</p><p>"It's Haisei Tsubasa, and he's not a  slob! He's...rugged." Yuka countered. "He's really smart too...he's just  working as an auto mechanic now so he can get enough money for college."</p><p>"He  sounds like fine boyfriend material to me, Yuka." Akane assured.</p><p>"Thank  you, Akane," Yuka smiled proudly giving Sayuri a "there, you see?" look.</p><p>"Hmph. Probably just a line he fed you to get into your  pants..." Sayuri grumbled.</p><p>"Sayuri! That wasn't very nice!" Akane admonished.</p><p>"It's okay, Akane. She's just jealous is all."  Yuka stuck her tongue out at Sayuri.</p><p>"So  Akane, you were saying about Ranma?" Sayuri said, pointedly changing the  subject.</p><p>"He  just makes me so angry...This morning...he cooked breakfast, so Kasumi could  have a break...which would have been fine, but he was so happy about it. His  father said it was okay and he was smiling and singing and carrying on...As if  he actually liked cooking."</p><p>"Lots  of men cook, Akane. Lots of women can't. That's not really anything to worry  about." Yuka asserted as some of her stiffness returned.</p><p>Akane sighed. "I wish you were there today,  Yuka, I might not of blown up like I did..."</p><p>"Um...Akane,  honey...there's no stopping you when you blow up," Sayuri said, " You're like a  typhoon, we all just have to board up the windows and hope for the best."</p><p>"I'm  not that bad am I?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Yes,"  Yuka nodded, "Yes, you are."</p><p>Akane looked at her friends' earnest faces  and sighed. "I guess you're right. I went too far this time though."</p><p>"What  did you do?" Yuka asked.</p><p>"I  called him a 'girly girl' over and over. I even made up a haiku. And then later  on, when he was acting like a cat I wouldn't pet him or even let him walk with  me." Akane looked at her hands around the drink can sadly.</p><p>Sayuri looked at Yuka. Yuka looked at Sayuri.  Then the two girls burst into laughter.</p><p>"It's  not funny!" Akane protested.</p><p>"Yes  it is!" Sayuri laughed.</p><p>"You  bet! I wish I HAD been there...just to see the look on Ranma's face!" Yuka  agreed. "What was the haiku? You HAVE to tell us."</p><p>"Um it  was...you're a girly girl, such a girly girly girl,  even when you're male." Akane said smiling a little now.</p><p>"That  is SO inspired, Akane. You should be a poet!" Yuka quipped.</p><p>"It's  about time you did something about that freaky cat problem of his too." Sayuri  added.</p><p>"Okay,  you guys, I see what you mean, but this is really serious! Ranma was really  hurt by it!"</p><p>"Oh  come on, Akane, he can't have taken it serious! Besides, so you used a weakness  against him, isn't that just like Anything Goes?" Sayuri asked.</p><p>"All  joking aside, Akane, Ranma does have some major problems," Yuka said, "On top  of that, you have the whole fiancée thing hanging over your head...I think  maybe what you really need is a break. Some time away from him to think things  over. My family's going to the beach this weekend, maybe you could come too.  Sayuri is coming of course. She practically lives with us as it is!"</p><p>"Hey,  there's nothing to do at my house!"</p><p>"Yeah yeah, my heart bleeds for you. Really."  Yuka waved off Sayuri, "So what do you say, Akane? You want to come? You know  my father deals with this stuff all the time anyway."</p><p>"I  don't need a shrink," Akane asserted.</p><p>"Don't  be silly," Yuka said, "EVERYBODY needs a shrink."</p><p>"Heh,  well...I'll think about it." Akane said.</p><p>"Okay.  Tomorrow's a half day, we leave right after school. Just let me know by then."</p><p>"Come  on Akane! It'll be fun! You probably won't even SEE Yuka's dodgy old dad."  Sayuri pushed.</p><p>A little girl came in with a satchel and set  it on the desk. Everyone hurried to their desks.</p><p>"Hinako-sensei's  here, you guys... you're not going to tell anybody anything I said about Ranma  are you?" Akane stage whispered.</p><p>"Oh  Akane, it's going to get out some time anyway," Yuka said, "You can't control  rumor."</p><p>"Yeah  and there isn't anything to worry about." Sayuri added, "I mean, it's not like Ranma's Nabiki!"</p><p>Akane swallowed, but said nothing.</p><p>Just then a voice came over the school  intercom. "Tendo Akane, please meet with the assistant principal in the main  office...Tendo Akane, please meet with the assistant principal in the main  office."</p><p>Akane gathered her things, bowed to  Hinako-sensei and left the class. She suddenly felt a sickening pang of  guilt...like she had just stepped in a small puppy. As she walked, the feeling  festered and mutated into a general feeling of impending doom. She hadn't told  her friends the whole story. She hadn't really understood it all herself. Ranma  was having trouble with his curse, and despite what her friends said, she knew deep down that she had messed up big time.</p><p>Tofu put down the receiver of the black radial  telephone as Nabiki, the real Nabiki, walked unsteadily in the room. "I just  finished phoning your father and your school. Your sister and the rest of your  family should know the basics of what happened by now."</p><p>"Tell  me, Doctor...What exactly <i>are</i> the  basics of what happened?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"You  got in a car accident...Ranma saved your life, and you are both now here at the  clinic. Is that satisfactory?"</p><p>Nabiki gave a small smile, "That's fine. I'm  mostly still trying to get my bearings, but I appreciate your discretion. I  suppose no one's come by about the bike?"</p><p>"The bike?"</p><p>"My motorcycle. I was driving a motorcycle. It's rather  important to me. I'd ask about the woman and the baby, but I already talked  with them in the other room." Nabiki paused as she recalled her conversation  with them. "You have a lot of interesting cases, don't you Tofu-sensei?"</p><p>"Yes...I've  gained something of a reputation among my colleagues. They've started to send  special cases to me."</p><p>"So,  you ought to be rich by the time you marry my sister huh?" Nabiki smirked, "You  do plan on proposing soon, don't you?"</p><p>"Yes,  w-well, she s-s-says she w-wants to w-wait..." Tofu  replied, pulling at his collar and smiling nervously.</p><p>Nabiki frowned. "I'm going to have to talk to  her it seems. All she told me this morning was that you guys didn't get  back...till...late." Nabiki stopped herself and shook her head. When had she  talked to Kasumi?</p><p>"I'm a  little surprised to see you up already." Tofu said, changing the subject. "How  are you feeling?"</p><p>"My  arm aches a bit...and I could really use a change of clothes, but otherwise I'm  fine...I think." Feeling the cold wetness in her underpants, Nabiki wished she  could emphasize the need to change more without risking embarrassment.</p><p>"Here,"  Tofu picked up a brown piece of clothing and handed it to Nabiki. "It's just  some gi pants that got a shrunk a little in the wash.  You may want to ask Happosai for a pair of panties though." Tofu smiled.</p><p>This was precisely why Nabiki didn't want to  have a serious relationship with the man. Sure he was a hunk and a doctor, but  for that comment alone, Nabiki figured Kasumi could have him.</p><p>"Is  there something else?" Tofu asked still smiling after Nabiki took the pants.</p><p>Nabiki sighed. "I don't know whether this is  important...but I thought it best to ask you. I'm seeing auras... all the time.  I used to only be able to do that after an intense yoga session and only very  faintly even then. Now...its very distinct."</p><p>Tofu nodded slowly his smile disappearing.  "Nabiki, you were clinically dead for a short while there...it's not unheard of  to gain a greater psychic affinity after such a thing...but there's something  else...isn't there."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Sometimes...my thoughts are a  little...unclear. It's like I'm thinking two things at once...I think I may  have gotten some of Ranma's memories somehow...but everything is very vague, so  I can't be sure if it's that or...something else."</p><p>Now Tofu could be delivering a eulogy. "I'll  have to do some tests. I won't lie to you, there's a good chance there was  some...damage, but my guess is it's as you say. No one knows what the soul is  exactly but we do know that ki has an awful lot to do with it. Most memories  wouldn't be transferred. Ranma didn't download into you or anything. But  certain key moments in his life that formed the facet of himself that was like  you, some memories of things that you and he might have done similarly... as  well as some things that are ingrained into his being..."</p><p>"What  sort of... things?"</p><p>"It's hard  to say. Off hand I wouldn't be surprised if you picked up some martial arts  skill. That's something I saw in all of his personalities. You must remember,  Nabiki, you came very close. Some parts of you may be lost entirely..."</p><p>Nabiki took a breath, not bothering to hide  her fear.</p><p>Tofu put his hand on her shoulder, "Or maybe  nothing was lost. All I'm saying is that you can't take things for granted.  Just be glad you're alive, and that no one else was hurt."</p><p>Nabiki looked up and gave Tofu a faint smile,  "Thank you, Doctor. I don't like to be in debt to anyone, and you've already  helped us out..."</p><p>Tofu lowered his eyes and put a hand up,  silencing Nabiki, "You owe me nothing. Your family... I owe more to your family  than I can ever repay."</p><p>"What  are you talking about?"</p><p>Tofu had a sad look on his face and for a  moment he looked much older than his twenty-five years of age. He stared  blankly at a wall and said, "The migration...some say it never ends..." Looking  back to Nabiki he smiled softly, "Enjoy yourself, Nabiki. Things are going to  get a lot worse."</p><p>"Riiight," Nabiki said warily as she tried to make some  sense out of what Tofu had just said, "I'm still a little groggy I  think...Whatever the case, you may have a debt to the family, but there are  personal debts too...All I'm saying is if there's anything I can do for you  sometime, I'm your girl. And I won't make you buy me things beforehand, I  swear."</p><p>"Heh,  I should hope not. My mother still talks about that little debacle." Tofu  seemed to go to a far away place again for awhile but he snapped back to  reality with a smile. "Get some rest. Don't try to leave though...there's a  young police officer who's very keen on arresting you for some reason."</p><p>"I  think I can handle him." Nabiki smiled mischievously. "I'll wait till my family  gets here though. Oh...one other thing...a friend of mine, Tomo Hoko is feeling  ill. Her mother is worried about her. It's probably nothing serious, but if you  get a chance you might call her."</p><p>"I  will. Thank you, Nabiki."</p><p>Nabiki nodded and left Tofu's office, feeling  a little better now. Actually she felt a lot better, refreshed almost. It was  as if by surviving that crash she had passed some sort of test and now  everything was going to be okay.</p><p>She went to the bathroom and changed out of  her short shorts and underwear and into the worn out brown pants. She still  wore her uniform dress. Looking in the mirror the pants under the dress looked  almost stylish. Almost.</p><p>She had to talk to Ranma. She had to find out  somehow just how much her was different. And why Ranma  was able to act so much like her that even her own body couldn't tell the  difference. Suddenly Nabiki remembered that moment earlier that morning when  they had locked eyes, and instead of thinking of the gun...there was something  else...</p><p>A feeling of intense rage,  of injustice, of animal bloodlust. Poised over a  fallen man in a dingy white gi and deep red gashes in  his side, five seconds away from separating the head from the body and perhaps  sucking the blood for the protein. Knowing that all that needed to be  done was stand up, regain humanity, but not being able  to. A young child...far away but close enough to hear with  heightened senses. Words of accusation, raised  with a small arm and index finger to an older man. "That's him! That's the man  who stole my kitty!" And suddenly the only thought is "Not in front of the  child." Because childhood is suddenly something just as small  and far away. And then tears, and running no...  bounding away. On all fours for  hours, in the cold, bleeding naked from so many small cuts and scrapes. Finally collapsing in the arms of an elderly woman. Hoping  that somehow what was done could be undone, that childhood could be restored,  that all that happened could have happened to someone else, something else, and  slowly... finding the strength to forget.</p><p>Nabiki's eyes went wide and she staggered  back at the sudden vivid vision. She knew it was Ranma's memory. It had to be.  But it happened to her all the same.</p><p>Ranma had demons just as nasty, maybe even  nastier than her own, and unlike her, he kept them tightly locked away for  years. Nabiki felt the darkness, the cold darkness, and she knew what it  wanted.</p><p>It wanted revenge.</p><p>Shampoo woke up in the grassy bank of the  canal. For a few moments she didn't know why she was there. And then she  remembered.</p><p>It was the Nekoken.</p><p>Shampoo had learned Ranma's ultimate secret  technique, the technique that even her great grandmother could not defeat. She  was now, in effect, the strongest warrior not just of her generation, but of  the entire village. She wouldn't be jumping for glee anytime soon, though.</p><p>Something stank about it all. It reeked of Cologne. She had  egged Shampoo on when she went after Ranma. When she had come back, she was the  one who had cursed her. All through the time in Nerima, Cologne humored  Shampoo in her endeavors with Ranma, but anything she suggested always ended up  failing miserably. Furthermore all that time she was sticking Ranma in his girl  form, training him, helping learn new techniques, as if Ranma was her newest  acolyte, as if Ranma was a female warrior. Shampoo's earlier assessment - that  Cologne was trying to  make Ranma female - had had one major flaw: why bring Shampoo at all if that's  what she wanted?</p><p>Now Shampoo knew. Cologne was at the  tournament, she would have seen just as easily as Shampoo could now that Ranma  knew the Nekoken. The fluidity with which he moved, the sensitivity of his  senses, it was obvious for anyone who knew the signs. Cologne must have  read the text concerning the technique and found a loophole, a way around the  strict rules against teaching it, as well as a way to make it work for some one  who wasn't a child.</p><p>Cologne must have  known what the cat spring would do to Shampoo. She would have known that  Shampoo would be attracted to the cat within Ranma. That eventually Shampoo  would either have to force Ranma to have sex with her or have sex with another  man. Ranma would then either be forced to accept the marriage or he would  completely free of it, which would make him that much more likely to be lured  in with Cologne's Amazon  techniques.</p><p>Shampoo stopped herself. It all seemed  unbelievable. But why else was the elder here? Just to make a mockery of  herself and Shampoo, failing every attempt to bring back Shampoo's husband? The  old hag was many things, but she was not a baffoon. And unlike Shampoo, she had  experience. She had to know what she was doing.</p><p>Shampoo had to accept it. Either everything  from getting the curse on had been meticulously planned out by Cologne, or the elder  was a terribly strict and paradoxically intelligent idiot. The first one  appealed to cold logic, while second seemed ridiculous.</p><p>Cologne had planned  it all.</p><p>If Cologne's plan had  worked, it would have been perfect for her. She would return with two female  warriors trained in the Nekoken with one, maybe even both, pregnant with strong  children for the village. She'd be set for the rest of her old life.</p><p>And who knows, if it had worked maybe Shampoo  would have been happy.</p><p>But it hadn't. Ranma's curse changed somehow.  And Shampoo knew now why she hadn't been able to move on and forget Ranma after  getting cursed as punishment. She knew why her infatuation had grown, mutated,  festered into an obsession. It was lust. Animal lust.</p><p>Shampoo shook her head. She loved Ranma.  Whatever the cause, she knew in her heart that was true.</p><p>The cause WAS important though. Ranma was at  least partially a cat. That was why she had wanted him initially. Even now she  wanted him like that. To come to her, claws outstretched...eyes glowing blue  against the backlight. She needed it like the worst drug imaginable...</p><p>And that was why she could never be with him.  Not now that she knew. She spent too long resisting those urges to succumb to  them now. And if she did she'd be doing exactly what Cologne wanted her to  do. And she never wanted to do anything for that hag ever again.</p><p>But she couldn't get away. She was an Amazon  and as an Amazon she was bound to Ranma until either he or Shampoo died. As an  Amazon she had to respect her elder, and follow her orders. As an Amazon she  had to keep working at the cat café alongside a man that made her sick for as  long as Cologne deemed it  necessary.</p><p>It was all a lie. All the pride she had was  unfounded. All the respect she had gained an illusion to mollify her and mold  her into what the elders deemed worthy. All that Shampoo had ever wanted was  respect. But respect was just the carrot used to entice her forward. To make  her travel across China and into Japan to kill the  person she was growing to respect herself. She could have killed Ranma. She  came so close, but she was not a killer.   There were times on the road beaten by monsoon weather and grueling  hikes through unkempt trails that she had wanted to stop, even join the  red-head and her panda by the fire. But she could not. Because  of the Amazon law. When she got to Japan and Ranma  lied to her and said he was a girl, something that happened all the time with  Jusenkyo curses...Shampoo could have stayed. Could have tried to be friends,  but she could not. Because of the Amazon law. There  was no middle ground. She had to either be a wife or a killer, and since Ranma  didn't want either she had to go back. Cologne cursed her,  they went back to Japan but things  just kept getting worse and worse.</p><p>Cologne had stopped  teaching Shampoo new techniques after she had helped Ranma get the Phoenix pill. It was  punishment for her rebellion against an elder. Just as the cat curse was a  punishment for Shampoo's inability to kill or capture Ranma. But it wasn't just  punishment. Shampoo knew now. Cologne <i>knew</i> Shampoo would help Ranma. She <i>knew </i>Ranma would use the Nekoken and  would have to ask for Shampoo's aid. And right after Ranma used the Nekoken,  she gave him the Phoenix pill.  Shampoo's marriage was only a diversion to the woman. She wanted the Nekoken.</p><p>The energy that Shampoo felt as she dug her  claws into Ranma's back and the red-head became a cat...it was so powerful, so  intoxicating... That was the beginning of the end it so many ways. A part of  Shampoo had always suspected Cologne was using  her, but she was an elder, and to disobey an elder was one of the highest  crimes of the Amazons.</p><p>Maybe Shampoo was oversimplifying. Maybe she  was half-crazed from almost being raped by someone she loved because they had  the mind of a feline. But it seemed so clear now. All this time she had taken  such pride in being an Amazon, but it was being an Amazon that kept her from  all the things she ever wanted.</p><p>Shampoo suddenly felt sick. She wanted  desperately to find some reason, any reason to believe what she was taught all  her life. She tried to think of the good things, the training, the knowledge,  the friends, but she never had any friends, Japan had so many  more opportunities for learning, and she could train just as well in Japan maybe even  better with out Cologne forcing her  to make deliveries. There was Lin Lin and Ran Ran...but when was the last time she talked to them? Then  there was Mousse, blind dumb, angry, Mousse. Why was he around in the first  place?</p><p>Redundancy. As much  as she avoided it, if she had gotten desperate enough she would have gone to  Mousse, who at least would stick around afterwards, who she at least knew.  Shampoo fought back bile at the thought. That would be Hell. Still, even if  Mousse was a back up stag, Shampoo would miss him. There were times when he  wasn't so bad and in a way he was like an extremely annoying kid brother...</p><p>Shampoo took a shuddering breath as she  realized that she had already made her decision.</p><p>"Today,"  Shampoo swore to the horizon, "Shampoo...no longer Amazon." She reached to her  side, to the small dagger she always kept there. She took a fist of her hair,  held it over her head, and swiped through it. She threw the hair to the ground.  It fell in a heap of shining purple like some beautiful creature now dead.  Shampoo stared at it for a moment, and then threw her knife into it so that it  quivered, stuck in the ground. "Bie Liao, Great Grandmother," She sneered and headed off to  enact a plan still forming in her head.</p><p>Kuonji Ukyo sat in Hinako-sensei's English  class looking out the window and thinking. Hinako was coloring in a Walt-Disney  book, and eating pocky, while most of the students diligently contemplated  their American comic books. Any learning that went on in the class was purely  accidental.</p><p>Ukyo was tired and depressed.</p><p>Ranma wasn't there today. She had seen Akane  talking to her friends. She seemed upset about something. Ukyo halfway  considered asking the girl what it was, but she didn't really feel like having  the inevitable battle that would ensue. Just before class she was called to the  office. Ukyo hoped she wouldn't return for some time.</p><p>She had only four hours of sleep, if that.  She had spent a large part of her time in bed tossing and turning and trying to  find out some way she could get Ranma to look at her as more than a  friend...with out risking losing him as a friend. The truth of the matter was that  she was woefully unprepared for love in her life right now. For half her life  she lived as a boy. Planning her revenge, preparing her mind  and body for her next meeting with Ranma and his father. Then all of a  sudden...pow, love. He  called her cute. He was still the same little boy she played with so long ago,  and not at all the demon she imagined.</p><p>This was nothing new now of course. Still,  she was clueless as to what to do. Before coming to Nerima the protocol as she  understood it was to ask somebody out, see if you liked them and go on from  there. But Ukyo already KNEW she liked Ranma and, being his fiancée already,  she was in the two most awkward moments in a relationship at the same time. She  was at her wits end, trying anything that came to mind. She found herself  following Akane's and Shampoo's lead, alternatively hanging on Ranma and  beating him up. It wasn't what she wanted.</p><p>All she wanted was what they had  before...everything went wrong. She wanted to spar with him in the dojo every  morning before he taught a class and then fire up the grill so the students  wouldn't leave hungry. And then maybe Ranma would help her serve people in the  restaurant after teaching. Maybe they'd challenge each other on who could cook  the best and fastest okonomiyaki, and of course Ranma would be faster, but  Ukyou's would be better and no one would really be able to decide. And they'd  smile and kiss and say playfully "I'll beat you next time!"</p><p>Sometimes Ukyo envisioned whole days of  married life with Ranma, sometimes she thought of what she'd name the children,  of what they would teach them. Sometimes she imagined old friends visiting.  Sometimes she envisioned new adventures side by side with Ranma against  terrible odds. Sometimes...sometimes she just thought of the glorious sex.</p><p>But never in any of these visions did Ukyo  ever figure out HOW to get there. Even without the other fiancées it would be  difficult, but with them...</p><p>The thing Ukyo kept coming back to was that  she should be patient. That she should just try to be the best friend she could  be, and then things might just progress naturally. But it was so hard. Ukyo was  so worried that if she didn't do something, she would end up with nothing. That  time was running out...That things weren't falling into place, but falling  apart. She hated what all this was doing to Ranma. She hated what it was doing  to her. But she couldn't see anyway around it. Not if she wanted any chance of  being with the man she loved.</p><p>In short, Ukyo was tired and depressed.</p><p>Looking out of the window forlornly as she  was, Ukyo was the first to see Shampoo running toward the school, sporting an  awful haircut. She still was rather surprised however when Shampoo jumped  through the window and the wall and into the classroom. Then she remembered. "Oh.  It's Shampoo. I forgot."</p><p>"How  does she do that!" A student asked as the dust  settled.</p><p>"Yeah! This is the third floor!" remarked another.</p><p>"UKYO!" Shampoo yelled pointing a bonbori at the girl in  boy's clothing. "You rival, yes? You fight now, yes?"</p><p>Ukyo wasn't sure what surprised her more,  that Shampoo was picking a fight with her, apparently for the hell of it, or  that she actually said her name and not "spatula girl" or "boy-girl" or "finger  licker"</p><p>"Hey!"  Ukyo said finally, "you actually said my name!"</p><p>"DELINQUENTS!"  a figure rose from behind the rubble. Her eyes shown with the manic glare of  one too many candy bars. The silhouette quivered with the petulance of all the  terrible two's condensed and trapped in the body of a ten-year-old. "HAPPO GO-EN  SA-"</p><p>Ukyo ran for the opening that Shampoo had  made and made a break for it. The jump wasn't anything for a roof hopper like herself. And while she didn't feel like fighting, a fight  sounded a whole lot better than having her chi sucked out of her.</p><p>She landed and kept running toward the  baseball field. Looking behind her, she confirmed that Shampoo had followed her  out of the school. "What do you want?" Ukyo yelled back at the purple-headed  crazy girl.</p><p>"First  we fight, then we talk!" Shampoo yelled. "Is important. Find more secret place for  fight yes?"</p><p>Ukyo slowed down to an even trot sensing she  was no longer in any immediate danger. Shampoo caught up to her quickly. "We'll  go to that abandoned lot by the canal okay?"</p><p>Shampoo nodded. "Is good."</p><p>"What  happened to your hair, Sugar? Did you get in a fight with Ryoga?"</p><p>Shampoo shook her head. "Pig boy no get close  if try."</p><p>Ukyo nodded. Ryoga's bandannas were easy  enough to dodge, usually. Even if he did get over the "don't  hit girls" shtick that he had worse than even Ranma. "Is this about  Ranchan?" Ukyo asked as she ran at a steady pace beside the other girl.</p><p>Shampoo said nothing for a good minute, and  then at the bend in the road right before the lot she said, "Is about Ranma,  and no is about Ranma. Shampoo need to think. Need to fight too."</p><p>Another bit of strangeness: Shampoo said  "Ranma" and not "Airen." Ukyo had the distinct impression that once again,  something major had happened and she was the last to know. "Why can't you just  tell, me what's going on, Shampoo? You better not be trying some kind of 'kiss  of death' crap on me."</p><p>"No  kiss. Is fight between womans, not Amazon and outsider." Shampoo assured and jumped over the chain link  fence surrounding the lot.</p><p>Ukyo followed and made a cursory glance to  get a hold on her situation. The lot was fairly typical. The grass was long,  colored a dusty light brown-green, and fell on the ground in wispy tufts. There  were some large stones in the ground and of course that meant pebbles. Looking  down, Ukyo found that the ground still had some muddy patches from the rain  yesterday.</p><p>Ukyo smiled. This was going to be fun.</p><p>"We  here," Shampoo declared, "Now we fight." She leaped into the air holding her  twin bonbori wide while keeping a knee up to guard her torso. Ukyo watched her  until she reached the height of her jump. Shampoo made herself into a ball  bringing the bonbori to her chest and started a forward summersault. Ukyo  stepped back a few steps.</p><p>Shampoo spun faster, bringing the heads of  her bonbori crashing down on the head of her opponent...only her opponent  wasn't there. Ukyo jumped, using Shampoos neck as a springboard and twisted in  the air tossing some twenty spatula shuriken at purple-haired girl.</p><p>Shampoo had already turned around and dodged  and batted away the spatulas easily then ran and jumped for a flying sidekick,  hoping to catch Ukyo in the solar plexus. "Why you insult Shampoo with dumb  spatula attack?" She yelled in midair.</p><p>Ukyo took her giant spatula and slammed it  down on Shampoo's foot, sending the Chinese girl into a tumble. Ukyo then let  the momentum send the spatula down to the ground where it stuck in the mud,  almost halfway up the flat section. "That's why," Ukyo explained simply.</p><p>Shampoo rolled into the fall and was back on  her feet right away, still holding her bonbori. Ukyo could see that Shampoo now  favored her left foot, but she knew it wasn't a major injury. Shampoo nodded  comprehension. The spatula-shuriken were mainly a  diversionary tactic used to allow Ukyo to grab her larger weapon. Although  there was always the chance Ukyo'd get lucky.</p><p>Shampoo began to advance again...</p><p>Ukyo focused. She gripped the handle of the  giant spatula tightly feeling its nature, making it one with her body. She  cleared her mind of all thought. There was only Okonomiyaki, and the customer  she was to serve...</p><p>Shampoo ran towards Ukyo, but her motion  seemed much slower now. Ukyo sent her ki through the spatula into the soft  muddy ground. First there was the batter...it must be the correct consistency  or the Okonomiyaki would come out flawed. Ukyo coaxed the mud into being  softer, more cohesive. more clay-like...</p><p>Shampoo stepped into a spin, most likely a  kick followed by a swing of the bonbori, Ukyo surmised. The customer would want  something hard and constricting. Ukyo hefted the spatula and the mud stuck like  taffy to its end. Just as the hook kick passed through the air Ukyo's head  occupied only moments before, Ukyo brought the taffy-like mud in an arc,  covering Shampoos arms, torso and upper thigh. Just as it made contact the mud  hardened into rock. Shampoo spun crazily and fell down rather jarringly.</p><p>Another satisfied customer.</p><p>Ukyo smiled. She had been practicing with mud  as a combat batter for some time now. That was the first time she was ever able  to use it against an opponent in combat though. She still preferred real  Okonomiyaki batter, but one point Ranma had driven home time and time again was  the need for adaptability. Still, she had thought Shampoo would last longer  than that.</p><p>"Ow!" Shampoo exclaimed, "How Ukyo do that?"</p><p>"I  trained for years battling the waves of the ocean. I can deflect or attract  anything that has water in it, as long as I use my spatula, and I concentrate  deeply enough."</p><p>Shampoo nodded sadly. "Ukyo win this time. Is  only because Shampoo not train serious for too too long. Shampoo COULD beat..."</p><p>"Here,  Sugar, I'll let you out of there." Ukyo concentrated and tapped the mass of  rock around Shampoo with her spatula. The rock crumbled away from the Chinese  girl. Shampoo sat up and rubbed her ankle pensively. "Now what is all this  about? I thought you trained all the time with your great grandmother?"</p><p>Shampoo snapped her eyes to Ukyo, and for a  second, Ukyo wondered if Shampoo was going to attack again. Then Shampoo lowered  her eyes to the ground. "Old Ghoul not train Shampoo.  Only train Ranma and Pig Boy. Tell Shampoo 'clean restaurant', 'make delivery'  Tell Shampoo is punishment. Shampoo obey because is Elder and relative. Shampoo fool. Shampoo train herself in off times, but no is  enough."</p><p>A growing excitement filled Ukyo. Maybe she  had more of a chance with Ranma! If Shampoo was this weak...</p><p>"Shampoo  see Ukyo think of Ranma now. Is good. Shampoo like  Ukyo more than violent girl. Ukyo be best match yes?"</p><p>And now Ukyo was confused. "Is this some  trick of yours? You trying to make me go against Akane  maybe?"</p><p>Shampoo shook her head. Ukyo had never seen  the girl so down. "Shampoo have big problem with Ranma. Sha-...I...can't  love him. No can be Airen."</p><p>"I  don't understand...I thought your rules said you had to be..."</p><p>Shampoo stood up. "I break rules! Shampoo no  longer Amazon. Shampoo lied to all life, just find out. Need to fight to see if true what Sh...I  think. I need help. I need training. I need learn Japanese more better. I need  job... I need new life."</p><p>Ukyo  couldn't believe what she was hearing! This changed everything! She had a  chance now! But Ukyo couldn't be completely happy. It was true she'd drop  Shampoo in a heartbeat if it meant she could be with Ranma, but now that she  was out of the picture...Shampoo and she had always had an uneasy friendship of  sorts. And now...there was still Akane to deal with, but it was as if Shampoo  practically handed her Ranma! Before she even realized it, she found herself  hugging the former Amazon tightly. "Don't worry, Sugar. This will work out."</p><p>Shampoo stiffened, but gradually she returned  the hug. "It long time...You very much like mans sometimes, but you strong  warrior."</p><p>Ukyo released Shampoo. Ukyo was shocked to  see moisture on the girl's cheeks. This was serious shit she was getting  herself into. "Shampoo, honey, I'm going to help you, but I need to know why  you're doing this. I mean for all I know you could be under some charm or  something..."</p><p>Shampoo wiped her tears away quickly and  swallowed. "Old ghoul train, but not in way Shampoo think. Shampoo  curse very bad. Have very much trouble during...blood time..."</p><p>"Oh gods!" Ukyo had never put it together...cats go into  heat! That would be terrible!</p><p>Shampoo nodded, "Many cats come. I fight off.  Night after night."</p><p>"But...why  don't you just use some of that waterproof soap of yours?"</p><p>"Is very rare and expensive."</p><p>"Yeah,  but wouldn't Cologne want to keep  something like that from happening to you? She could find a way to get it."</p><p>Shampoo gritted her teeth. "Hag  no care. Something happen she say is punishment. She  here for Ranma."</p><p>"What  do you mean, sugar?"</p><p>"She want Ranma as Amazon. Make good babies." Shampoo's hands  were shaking fists, her knuckles bone white. "Today Ranma become like cat. Just  like other cats. He try to..." Shampoo shuddered.</p><p>Ukyo got the picture. "What did you do?"</p><p>"Shampoo  fight off...just like other cats. Shampoo become like cat to fight off... Old  ghoul find way to teach Nekoken."</p><p>And here Ukyo was starting to think of Cologne as a nice old  lady who knew martial arts. She must have chosen the spring Shampoo fell into.  She must have planned the whole thing! And to her own great granddaughter no  less! "So that's why you're not an Amazon anymore."</p><p>Shampoo nodded.</p><p>Ukyo's eyes drifted to Shampoo's hair. It  hung ragged along the nape of the neck. Shampoo's long bangs on either side of  her face still there. It looked terrible, like someone had just hacked through  it with a knife...It all made dreadful sense now. Except for one thing... "What  would you have done if you beat me?"</p><p>Shampoo made eye contact for a moment and  then stared off into the distance. "I need to train. You strongest womans here I know. I hear battle with Ranma much longer  than Shampoo's. No believe it before, now do. If I beat you, I probably go to  someone else. Need to know level. Need to find good training partner. But even  if beat, I still ask for help. You have restaurant, no delivery. I want see Cat  Café go bye bye."</p><p>Ukyo shared an evil smile with her new ally.  This was getting better and better. "What do you plan on doing about Cologne?"</p><p>"First train. Train hard."</p><p>"Yeah, and then what, Sugar?"</p><p>Shampoo clenched her fists again. Her eyes  looked dead and risen...filled with cold darkness.</p><p>"After  training," Shampoo said, "I kill."</p><p>Nabiki found Ranma in the waiting room  talking to the Yamashitas about their peculiar predicament. He was male and he  sprawled languidly on the couch like seats as he talked to the woman in the  plain brown kimono and her baby/husband.</p><p>She studied them for awhile from the doorway,  marveling at how their auras shown now. Ranma's was a deep aqua blue...Mrs.  Yamashita was a warm yet orderly brown. Her baby/husband glowed  a dark orange.  As distinct as the auras  were, Nabiki could still see things through them without difficulty. The colors  were really more of a suggestion than a reality. Nabiki returned her gaze to  Ranma. Notably absent were the butterfly earrings he was supposed to be  wearing...the Thyself Known? Nabiki winced mentally. Another  Ranma memory. They were supposed to keep Ranma from going crazy or  something.</p><p>At first it seemed to be the same old Ranma,  his trademark awkward casualness readily apparent. But then he started  talking...</p><p>"So,  you're telling me there's an honest to goodness fountain of youth in a cave  somewhere here in Japan?" Ranma's  grammar was definitely better.</p><p>"Yeth." The baby in the woman's  arms nodded, "Ith in Hokaido  actually. I had to dig thlough a hot thpling to find it. Got a little too much  on me. Doctol Tofu theemth  to think he can acthelelate my ag'ing,  but ith going to be difficult." Mr. Yamashita, having  no teeth and a somewhat underdeveloped tongue, had a lisp that was more of a  gurgling wet sound and a ridiculously high voice. You could try not to laugh,  but it was best to get it over with early on rather than let it burst out all  at once. Nabiki had talked with the man before, but she still had to smile a  bit.</p><p>"But  what's stopping other people from falling in?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"My  men blew it up aftel I...tlang'ed...got  youngel I mean. I would have liked to thtudy it mole but I didn't have muth  thay in the mattel." The  baby grimaced.</p><p>"Come  now, Ichiro, we wouldn't want that sort of thing to get to the public would  we?" Mrs. Yamashita chided.</p><p>"Thtop patlonithing  me woman! Jutht because I look like a baby doethn't mean you can tleat me  like one!"</p><p>"Oh"  Mrs. Yamashita said matter of factly, "I suppose you  can feed yourself from now on then?"</p><p>"Thatth not what I meant!"</p><p>"Ahem."  Nabiki interrupted, smirking from the doorway.</p><p>"Hey, Firefly!" Ranma called, "It's good to see you up!"</p><p>Nabiki stiffened. She hadn't been called that  for more than a decade... "Ranchan...we need to...talk." The weirdness level  just refused to go down. Nabiki hadn't intended to say "Ranchan" it just...came  out. She saw Ranma stiffen in much the same way she had.</p><p>"Right." Ranma swallowed.</p><p>Mrs. Yamashita got up without further  provocation and bowed to them both, "I'm glad to see you're both well. I will  see if Tofu sensei is ready for us."</p><p>"Thank  you Yamashita-san" Ranma and Nabiki said at the same time.</p><p>When the Yamashita's were gone, Nabiki waited  a minute, and then asked, "The log of 'a' plus the log of 'b' equals what?"</p><p>"The log of 'a' times 'b?'" Ranma answered.</p><p>"That  is SO unfair." Nabiki commented.</p><p>Ranma responded by throwing a punch to  Nabiki's midsection...which she easily dodged. "No...THAT is unfair." Ranma  countered.</p><p>Nabiki sighed. She supposed she'd have to  concede the point. Ten years of intense training and she got most of it in  about an hour.</p><p>"This  is too damn weird." Ranma said.</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "I think we need to figure out  exactly how much we know about each other, before we both go nuts."</p><p>"Um...I  know about the gun."</p><p>"Yes...and  I know you almost killed your father."</p><p>"What?  What are you talking about? I never..." Nabiki saw Ranma's aura darken and  could see he was reliving the whole thing in his mind. Ranma's fists clenched.  "Damn. SHIT!"</p><p>"Calm  down. You didn't kill him did you? You're not a murderer. So you're not going  to kill my little sister either."</p><p>Ranma looked at the ground for a bit, with  crazed eyes. "I still want to. I can't get it out of my head. I want to wring  her neck...tear her to pieces..."</p><p>"It  doesn't look like the relationship is working out all that  well," Nabiki noted</p><p>"Heh,  yeah you could say that." Ranma leaned back, sighing. "I just wish I could stop  thinking about her."</p><p>"Freudian  slip there, Ranchan?"</p><p>"Yeah,  I think I know what you mean. I kind of love her, and I kind of hate her at the  same time." Ranma said.</p><p>Nabiki blinked. Ranma said he loved Akane!  But the way he said it...it wasn't the kind of love that you marry someone  over. "I know how you feel, believe me." Nabiki sat down on the sofa.</p><p>"I  believe it." Ranma said sitting down himself.   "How did you get over it?"</p><p>"I got  even."</p><p>"What  do you mean?"</p><p>Before Nabiki knew it she answered him. "Any  time I felt like killing someone I took a piece of paper and listed all the  things they did to me, and I figured out ways to get them back. The trick is  planning. The more planning you do the better you feel afterwards, no matter  what it is you actually do to the person."</p><p>"I'll  have to try that." Ranma smiled mischievously. "How did you get even with  Akane?"</p><p>Nabiki thinned her lips. "The gun pretty much  did it for me. She was scared to go near me for months. I got some satisfaction  from that I have to say. Still, it mostly just made me feel so lousy..."</p><p>"Right." Ranma smiled slightly, "My vote's  for plan B"</p><p>"Speaking  of psychotic behavior...aren't you supposed to be wearing those earrings?"</p><p>Ranma's hand went to his ear reflexively. "I  don't know. They just fell out when I woke up. I think I'm actually less screwed  up than I was this morning, believe it or not. Maybe I don't need them any  more. I got them in my pocket though, just in case."</p><p>"Have  you tried just wearing them around your neck or something? Do they have to be  in your ear?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head, "I haven't tried, but I  don't think that will work. I think they need to be in contact with my blood or  something...Besides it's not that big a deal. I've got this weird memory of  going to the mall by myself to get my ears pierced...missing my mother."</p><p>Nabiki recalled the moment just as Ranma  mentioned it. Juxtaposed with it was a scene of a tournament, of Genma yelling  at her after she lost a battle and not having anyone say it was okay... "What  do you remember about your mother?" She said suddenly. It had been in the back  of her mind since he had called her Firefly.<br/>"You  mean growing up? Not much. Just recently I remember she used to call me  Ranchan, just like Ukyo and well, just like you did a little while ago. I think  I thought my name actually WAS Ranchan at one time. I don't know...its all foggy. Is it the same with you and Firefly?"</p><p>"Y-yes..."</p><p>"It  suits you, you know. When I tried to punch you just now, your aura flared  up...it was bright green. Not like Ryoga's puke green. It's like you're sad and  happy all at the same time."</p><p>"Well  that's more or less how I feel most of the time I suppose. Once you accept the  fact that the world isn't going to give you exactly what you want, you can  start to have fun with it." Nabiki scratched her temple and sighed. "My  mother...she used to call me that. Firefly."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Well,  there was this one night...It was in the summer and Mom and I were watching the  fireflies from the porch. Akane was just a baby then. Kasumi was at a friend's  house...it was just me and Mom." Nabiki glanced at Ranma. Why did she trust him  so much?</p><p>"So  what happened?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Nabiki shook her head free of the weirdness  and continued her story. "We turned all the lights off in the house and we just  watched the fireflies blinking on and off randomly. I remember I caught one and  showed it to her. She wanted me to release it, but I didn't want to. I wanted  to keep it forever. Then she said she could get a jar and I could put as many  as I could catch in it and keep it in my room. I was so excited, but then she  raised her finger and said 'But if you put them in a jar, they'll die by the  next day, and you won't ever see them again.'</p><p>"I was  maybe three at the time, I couldn't have known what  she was talking about. But somehow I understood what she said and I let the  firefly go. She hugged me then and asked why I wanted to keep the firefly.  'Because it glows pretty' I said or something similar.</p><p>"'And  you'd like to glow pretty too wouldn't you?' she asked. I giggled and said yes.  She went inside the house and came out with a flashlight. 'I bet with this  you'll be the prettiest little firefly there is.' she said. And she told me to  try talking to them and had me run out among them with the flashlight flicking  it on and off at them.</p><p>"I was  pretty sure Mom was joking and I got tired of it pretty quick. I sat down on  the step next to mom just thinking about fireflies and if maybe I should get a  jar after all. I was flicking the flashlight on and off out of boredom for  awhile and then my Mom says 'LOOK!' I didn't see  anything. I turned the flashlight on to see what she was talking about and I  swear every single firefly glowed. I turned off the flashlight to see them  better and they stopped.</p><p>"I  kept turning the flashlight on and off and the kept glowing with the flashlight  for almost five minutes before I tried leaving the light on and they went back  to their own rhythms. It was like they were dancing with me or something...I  don't know to this day whether I actually made them blink like that or if it  was some odd fluke. I was never able to make it happen again."</p><p>"Wow.  So maybe you WERE talking to them huh?" Ranma enthused.</p><p>"Sometimes  I like to think I was," Nabiki said still halfway in another time in place.  "Other times I like to think that it was just something beautiful that happened  for no reason. Either way I never forgot it. Sometimes I think some part of me  is still shining flashlights at the fireflies, trying to get them to dance."</p><p>They were both silent for awhile. Nabiki  couldn't believe she had just told all of that...to Ranma! But he had already  been in her head. He had already gone through all her defenses. And...it felt good.</p><p>"Nabiki?" Ranma's deep blue eyes asked her.</p><p>"What  is it, Ranma?" Nabiki breathed.</p><p>And suddenly she and Ranma were  kissing. Nabiki was kissing Saotome Ranma!</p><p>Her arms drifted up and down Ranma's back  over the hard muscles under the silk Chinese shirt. Ranma's hands slid up her  thigh, found her rear and squeezed. Nabiki moaned, breaking there kiss...Then  suddenly her eyes went wide. She pushed Ranma away and sat slumped in her seat,  her face flushed. "This can't be happening..." she muttered.</p><p>"Nabiki,  I've never felt like this for anyone before. I'm sorry...I don't know what came  over me..."</p><p>And suddenly Nabiki and Ranma were kissing  again. Their tongues were battling each other...their hands went all over each  others bodies. Soon Nabiki was on top of Ranma on the couch, her hands  unconsciously trying to take the black t-shirt off of Ranma...</p><p>"Ahem."</p><p>Nabiki jumped off Ranma and looked up,  startled at the man standing above them.</p><p>It was Officer 542, aka Kawagami Hiro.</p><p>"Ma'am,  this is a public place. Please show some decorum." Officer Kawagami said  coldly. He shoved some papers under Nabiki's nose. "You owe the city of Tokyo 55,682,842  yen. Your driver's license is revoked until the hearing which will be in three  weeks. Have a nice day."</p><p>Nabiki took the papers dumbly and Kawagami  turned around and left the room. His aura betrayed his crisp manner though.  Nabiki wondered how someone she didn't even know all that well could be so  jealous of her.</p><p>Nabiki looked at the papers. "This is not  good." She was guilty of everything on the paper. The fine would put the Tendo  family back in the red...and it was all her fault!</p><p>Ranma's arm went around her shoulder. "You  don't have to worry, Firefly, you've got me working for you now."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. She didn't completely like  this feeling of not being in control, but there was something nice about it. Comforting. She leaned into Ranma, grabbing his hand with  hers. "I don't know how this is going to turn out, Ranchan. Something tells me  this isn't going to last...but right now I don't care. Just...if you're going  to go insane again could you give me a few days?"</p><p>Ranma was silent for a while. "Nabiki, it's  not over... Tofu called it a migration and at first I laughed at him...but  now...I can feel it more. It's like I'm not in the right place within myself,  like things are shifting into place. But I know right now that at least this  part of me wants to be with you. And that isn't going to change."</p><p>Nabiki almost started kissing Ranma again.  But she turned her head back away before it happened. "Still...we need to take  things slow. If something unforeseen happens we might need to stop..."</p><p>"So,  casual sex is out of the question?" Ranma quipped.</p><p>Nabiki smirked. "Now I KNOW that was me just  then. There is no way you could have ever put 'sex' and 'casual' in the same  sentence before."</p><p>"You'd  be surprised..." Ranma said looking away.</p><p>Nabiki nudged Ranma in the ribs. "You're  being enigmatic, stop it!"</p><p>Ranma turned and smiled tiredly at Nabiki. "I  tried to seduce doctor Tofu."</p><p>"Oh...you too huh? That man is one sexy bastard."</p><p>Ranma hugged Nabiki closer. "Heh one thing  for sure, I'm definitely moving the engagement to you. I know neither of us  wants an engagement, but I think we can keep our fathers from doing anything  too stupid. Much better than I could with Akane anyway."</p><p>"Okay,  Ranma, but just for the record, I don't like it, and if this is some kind of  spell and we both wake up, you're going to owe me big time..." Nabiki smiled,  "I just thought of something."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Moving  the engagement to me would be the perfect revenge to have on Akane."</p><p>Ranma slapped his fist against the palm of  his other hand. "That's right! The bitch'll blow a  gasket! And if she thinks I'll let her hit me with a mallet when I'm not even  engaged to her..."</p><p>Nabiki put a finger to Ranma's mouth. "Down, boy. Remember, she's my little sister. You're angry  with her right now. That's okay. We'll get her back. She deserves it. But we're  not going to kill her... We're just going to make her dance."</p><p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~</p><p>It  gets weirder.</p><p>Thanks  go to Aondehafka and Edward, for the help, as well as Me, whoever Me is.</p><p>Any  mistakes are my own.</p><p>If  you see any, let me know.</p><p>Feedback  greatly appreciated.</p>
