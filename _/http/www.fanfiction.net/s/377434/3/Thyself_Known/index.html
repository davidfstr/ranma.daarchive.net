</div> <b><u><p style="text-align:center;">Thyself Known</p></u></b><i><p style="text-align:center;">Ch.3- The Beast Within</p></i><p>W. Brad Robinson</p><b><p>DISCLAIMER</p></b>: I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to steal Rumiko Takahashi's characters! Honest! It just sorta…happened. I suspect demonic forces are at work...<b><p>Note:</p></b> First off let me say that this will most likely be revised soon. I just wanted to get something out a soon as possible and so this hasn't been pre-read yet, so you're seeing this in it's raw and gory glory. Now then…<b><p>What Has Come Before</p></b>- Ranma had a dream. Ranma's curse changed. Now he's female whenever he <i>feels</i> female. Happosai can control minds and make ki apples. Oh and Ranma seems to have gone a <i>tiny</i> bit insane. It's okay…no biggie.<i><p>"You can have my isolation,</p><p>You can have the hate that it brings<br/>You can have my absence of faith,</p><p>You can have my everything</p><p>Help me tear down my reason,</p><p>Help me its' your sex I can smell<br/>Help me you make me perfect,</p><p>Help me become somebody else"</p></i><br/>-Closer- Nine Inch Nails<p>~~~~~[START]~~~~~</p><p>Early morning found Shampoo furry, exhausted, and miserable. She had been splashed the night before while delivering ramen, and as it turns out, cats can't ride bicycles. A five-minute trip on a bike instantly turned into a twelve or thirteen hour trek through darkened streets and strange neighborhoods. That wasn't what made Shampoo miserable though.</p><p>Though she kept quiet about it, the truth was that Shampoo hated her curse more than any other Jusenkyo victim. She hated it because it was a reminder of how stupid she had been, of her failure to secure Ranma to herself, and of her sheer ineptness. As an Amazon she hated ineptness…But all this was secondary, merely the insult added to a much more massive injury.</p><p>The real reason she hated her curse, the one she would only reveal to someone if she were extremely drunk and held at gunpoint…was what it did to her once a month.</p><p>It was a simple fact that was nonetheless easy to overlook. When Shampoo turned into a cat she WAS a cat physically. She retained her intelligence but her hormones…they were quite different.</p><p>Cats approach relationships a little bit differently from most humans. A cat does not, for instance, get to know another cat over a can of fish, then escort the other cat back to its home whereupon the decision to make love is made based on mutual agreement and after consideration is made of all the consequences. No, the feline concept of foreplay runs something like this: a female cat begins to menstruate. She unconsciously gives off a pungent odor that makes all male cats into sex craved lunatics. She also is driven to become a sex craved lunatic herself by the hormones raging through her bloodstream. A male cat approaches from behind whereupon the female can either act on what little self control they have and attack, or can adopt "The Position". Adopting "The Position" consists of lying on the stomach and raising the hindquarters with the back legs. This facilitates mating.</p><p>Shampoo REALLY hated her curse.</p><p>It was that time of the month for Shampoo, and though she pleaded with the old ghoul to let her stay at the Café…it was to no avail. Almost immediately after she was splashed, they started to come. The first one was the worst…It was a striped gray with a chunk taken out of his left ear. Very handsome by cat standards. Instantly she felt almost uncontrollable animal urges. Shampoo had to struggle to turn her feelings of animal lust into fury and lash out against the male before it was too late. Even then, he was battle-worn and persistent. It took a good five minutes to wound him enough so he would relent. Amazon techniques didn't translate well to her cat form, but they kept her from a fate worse than death.</p><p>Shampoo shuddered off the thought as she came to the back door of the Nekohanten. Even now she felt her body calling out to be taken… and Shampoo had no doubts as to her current sexual preference.</p><p>Shampoo padded through the pet door and went to the small furo in the back room. She jumped in, battling against the instinctual revulsion she felt about water in general and she became human once again. She felt the insane sexual hunger slip away in the heat. She relaxed, letting the water soothe her nerves.</p><p>Shampoo remembered a time when she was younger that she was worried she might not be attracted to men. It was only the fact that she wasn't attracted to women either that kept her from experimenting. If she used her imagination she could find some of the men attractive after awhile, but by then she had made her decision, she would only marry the one who would defeat her.</p><p>Now she knew with out a doubt what her preference was. It was her horrible secret… something she would rather die than reveal…</p><p>She was attracted to cats.</p><p>Male ones.</p><p>Preferably all black with ears slightly damaged but not to the point of being grotesque… Shampoo shook her head free of the image. At first it was just a dream that she had when she slept as a cat, but recently she'd been having it as a human too…</p><p>Having lived with the curse for a year now, Shampoo had come up with some rather desperate possible solutions to her problem. One idea she had…often…was that maybe if she just let herself be taken, she'd get over it and feel better. But that was WAY too dangerous. Shampoo recalled the text in Amazon Guide to Jusenkyo … "If a Jusenkyo victim is impregnated," the book said "then she will remain in form she was impregnated in for the rest of her life." If she ever succumbed to her urges…her humanity could be lost forever. If, on the other hand, she were to get pregnant in her human form…she'd be cured.</p><p>This was the true reason why the society that lived so close to Jusenkyo was matriarchal. Women had a not so easy cure to the curses. Men didn't. In a region with no running water, this placed women somewhat ahead of men in dominance. They didn't even need to carry the baby to term. Many of those women who were cursed simply got themselves pregnant and aborted right away using homemade herbal concoctions. There were those that disapproved of these actions, and from time to time, depending on who was on the council, they were sufficient grounds for banishment, but far more got away with it than suffered any consequences.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were several reasons why this desperate ploy would not work. First of all, if she got pregnant by anyone other than Ranma she'd never be able to return home. With Cologne watching her, there was no way that she could go against this. Second, the only man Shampoo was in any way attracted to was Ranma. No one else caught her eye at all, and whenever she tried thinking of being…intimate with Mousse, she became ill. He was her friend and though he was a little dense Shampoo didn't mind him really, she just couldn't stand the thought of being married to him.</p><p>If it was going to be anybody it had to be Ranma. Honored Mummy on Stick was SUPPOSED to be helping her get him, but ever since she used the cat's tongue on Ranma, Shampoo started to suspect what the old crone really wanted was for Ranma to join the amazons as a woman. Every time Shampoo thought of it the more sense it made. As a man, Ranma would be stifled. His skills, due to his backward culture, were more womanly than most would tolerate from a man. All he would be good for was genes, and while good genes are helpful in improving a bloodline, they do not ensure talent. On the other hand, if Ranma willingly joined the Amazons as a woman, then they'd have full access to his skills AND have the loyalty of his children as well. Not to mention that Akane, Ukyo, and even Kodachi would make formidable Amazons in their own right and if Ranma joined the Joketsuzoku then they might choose to follow.</p><p>Shampoo initially thought the idea wouldn't work. Despite being very womanly in skill and temperament (something Shampoo didn't mind at all, she liked a boy with spunk) Ranma was quite adamant about being a man. But when Grandmother used the Cat's Tongue and Ranma started working at the café… There were times when Shampoo couldn't imagine Ranma being a boy. It made Shampoo extremely scared.</p><p>She started glomping him even when he was a girl in the hope that somehow she could keep him from becoming a girl mentally Perhaps the idea was silly, but it was the only thing she could think of, and besides, she enjoyed it too much to stop. Yes, even if Ranma became a girl permanently, she'd still go after her. Lesbianism was hundreds of times better than … The Position. She shuddered again.</p><p>She hoped it didn't come to that though. Because then she'd have to lose her virginity to…someone she did not love. And it would probably be Mousse. Shampoo felt ill again.</p><p>She got out of the furo, dried off and dressed. She had to hurry or she might miss Ranma. Shampoo realized she was acting like a weak little lovesick boy, heck, her methods weren't all that different from Mousse's, but she didn't care. She loved Ranma. He was the only thing that brought her out of her funk. He was the only thing she had outside her work and her training. He was the only thing that made her feel alive.</p><p>She ran outside dodging Grandmother and Mousse. She had to see him to today. She had to.</p><p>He was the only thing that made her feel human.</p><p>Ranma Saotome was running on the top of the fence. She was also trying to change sexes with her mind. It wasn't working. Taking a break she took in her present situation. She was running because she was following Akane. She was following Akane because she wanted to know why she was so upset. She couldn't know why Akane was upset because Akane wasn't talking. Well, running on the fence wasn't solving anything. Ranma jumped down from the fence to intercept Akane.</p><p>"Oi! What's wrong with you today Akumph!"</p><p>Akane shoved past Ranma by gently slamming Ranma in the cheek with her fist and ran onwards.</p><p>Ranma caught up with her and ran along side of her. "C'mon Akane! You're more upset than usual and that's sayin' somethin'!"</p><p>"…" Akane answered. She kept running as if Ranma wasn't there.</p><p>Ranma didn't like this. Akane had insulted her a lot this morning and while it hurt, she was sure it was just Akane overreacting again. But what would make her so angry? Or…did she actually believe what she said? Ranma was worried. "Akane-chan? You know you can talk to me about anything and I won't think ill of you."</p><p>Akane stopped suddenly. "How dare you…" she spoke quietly, making her rage seem even more pronounced, "impersonate my <i>sister</i>!"</p><p>That was a strange accusation even from Akane…Ranma tried to clear her head, she needed information… "What on <i>earth </i>are you talking about?"</p><p>"Stop it, Ranma! It's not funny and I don't want to talk to you!"</p><p>"What's not funny?" Ranma asked confused.</p><p>"You were making fun of Kasumi and Nabiki you jerk!"</p><p>"No I wasn't…Why don't you tell me what's wrong, sugar."</p><p>"Arrgh! Now you're acting like Ukyo! If you want me to talk stop joking around!" Akane's hands were tight fists at her sides.</p><p>"I'm not joking Akane! Honestly! The way you're talking you'd think *<i>I*</i> were the one who's acting strange!" Ranma and Akane now looked like bookends of mindless indignation.</p><p>Red fire whipped about Akane as her aura's intensity reached the visual spectrum. "That's it. I don't have to take this. I'm NOT YOUR FIANCEE ANYMORE!" Akane summoned her mallet she swung with all her might…and missed.</p><p>Ranma dodged it, holding her fists under her chin cutely while her face held a worried expression. "Please stop it Akane! You're scaring me! You know I hate violence!"</p><p>Akane's mallet winked out of existence. "HA! I KNEW it! You were acting back then! You were just trying to get to me! You little SNEAK! And you slept in my ROOM!"</p><p>"Oh dear! I've been out for a while haven't I? I have all these new memories…Mother! She doesn't realize…Oh what will I do! I might have to leave my family…Maybe your Father could adopt me, Akane. Then we could be sisters!" Akane walked off. "Don't be angry Akane! I'm me again! If you want I'll leave it's just…You and your family have been so kind to me. I feel like I belong somewhere now."</p><p>Ranma's last words must have struck a chord with Akane. She stopped for a moment and then walked away more slowly. "You aren't fooling me again, Ranma."</p><p>"Akane, please don't be mad. I know you'd prefer it if I was a man, but it just can't be. I'm a woman. I can't change who I am anymore than you can."</p><p>"Don't make me laugh, Ranma. You seem to be doing a pretty good job of changing who you are." Akane said bitterly. "You can just stay a girl for all I care!" Akane started running again.</p><p>It was at that moment that Shampoo found Ranma standing with her fingers at her lips, like a worried little boy…</p><p>It's a little difficult to judge what is considered girl-like or boy-like to an amazon. Fighting people is a perfectly normal thing for a girl to do for instance, while boys are expected to stay inside and play with dolls. There are some things however, which transcend culture. One of these is the subtle difference in the way men and women carry themselves. Perhaps it has to do with the distant patriarchal origins of the Amazons, or maybe Shampoo had spent too much time in Japan, or perhaps there really is something instinctual that affects the culture norms of men and women, but somehow Shampoo felt a jangling femaleness in the traditionally (for her anyway) boyish action.</p><p>This would not do.</p><p>Shampoo prepared her glomp, visualizing her trajectory and making allowances for the diminished mass of Ranma's cursed form. "Wo de airen!" She cried as she launched from the ground. As she reached the height of her jump she saw something astonishing happen. Ranma changed from girl to boy in front of her eyes…without water. Excited, Shampoo hugged Ranma even tighter than usual "Airen find cure! You give to Shampoo yes?"</p><p>Immediately, Shampoo realized something was wrong. She couldn't put her finger on it…but it had something to do with Ranma purring…</p><p>Slowly, timidly Shampoo released Ranma. No longer supported by her, he landed on all fours on the concrete. A hungry look was in his eyes. Shampoo drew back frightened. She knew that look…she'd seen it so often that very night. An irrational fear filled her… a fear that gradually became something else. Without quite knowing how it happened, Shampoo dimly realized that her head was a little lower than Ranma's… she was adopting The Position. Ranma slunk behind her.</p><p>This was what she wanted right? This was Ranma… This was her Airen right? NO! Shampoo shouted back at herself NO this is NOT Ranma. This is just another CAT. I am NOT a cat. But Ranma was really human right? It was okay then wasn't it? NO! I am an AMAZON and there is no way I will let anyone, man or beast, treat me different! She turned around and slashed at Ranma, claws ripping through his shoulder…Claws?</p><p>"Reeeoooooow!" Ranma screamed and jumped back. Then, he crawled a little closer. "Mrowr?" He asked.</p><p>Get away! She wanted to say. Instead she said "Ftttt!" It sounded shockingly inhuman.</p><p>"Ryaow." Ranma commented and slunk away toward the human…Akane.</p><p>When it was obvious Ranma wasn't going to try anything, Shampoo sat back on her haunches and started to clean herself. Suddenly, she realized what she was doing. She stopped with some difficulty. She was human. She was not a cat. All she had to do was get up…If she could just remember how. She looked around…She had to get away from where there were humans…people. She had snap out of this. She loped away from Ranma and the human and toward a grassy area by a bridge. Tired from her recent exertion and from the long night previous…she fell asleep in a sunny section of grass.</p><p>The sequence of events from Shampoo's "Wo de Airen" onward was a car crash that Akane could not keep from watching. Suddenly, it all fell into place. Why Shampoo glomped Ranma all the time, why Ranma acted the way he did, the whole reversal jewel business. Akane's jaw went slack when she saw Shampoo's ki claws tear into Ranma's shoulder. Ranma really WAS a pervert…</p><p>Ranma fought the urge to pee along the wall. He knew that his human didn't like that and that the strange removable fur he had made marking territory a fruitless and uncomfortable task. It also prevented him from mating with the female cat human. She was in heat, he could tell. And she was attracted to him. Not only that, she was the same species both mind and body. She would have to be won though. It wouldn't be easy. Ranma's keen eyes darted to Akane. Easier than attempting to mate with his current girl human though. It was obvious she felt no attraction to him even when he wasn't a cat. Some rival must have stolen her affections. If Ranma could've marked his territory properly it would not have happened. "Mrowr." Ranma said disconsolately. He checked his shoulder…just a scratch, only about five centimeters deep. It should heal within a few days.</p><p>He ambled slowly toward the girl human. If Ranma had proper ears he would have flattened them. If he had a tail he would have waved it. He wanted his human to know how displeased he was with her. She had not given a decent petting since she lost her food preparing challenge. Ranma, being a cat, wasn't sure about the particulars of the challenge but he knew enough about challenges in general to know that Akane didn't know when to pick her fights. Ranma yawned and stretched his front paws/hands out lowering his upper back and raising his hindquarters. He brought his claws out causing massive gouges to appear in the pavement. My girl human would never make it as a cat, Ranma mused, She'd probably get killed after trying to chase a car, thinking she was a dog.</p><p>Ranma decided to risk approaching the human. "Meow?" He asked.</p><p>"Honestly, you're not going to try to fool me now are you? To think all this time I actually thought you were a cat when you were like this! Now I know its just one of your sick fantasies. Well, I refuse to be a part of it! I'm not into S and M, and I'm certainly not into bestiality."</p><p>"Meow?" Ranma asked incredulously.</p><p>"Okay maybe I'm into S and M a LITTLE…" Akane conceded. Then she shook her head angrily. "What am I telling YOU for! You… you… you BOY!" Akane's hammer winked back into existence and she prepared for an underhanded strike.</p><p>Ranma scurried off. His shoulder was starting to irritate him and he didn't feel like playing with his human right now. He had to find the healer human. He stopped on a street corner and sat on his haunches. There was another reason why he had to find the healer human…what was it? Ranma started to clean himself as he considered the matter.</p><p>Then suddenly his hand became a fist and hit his open palm. "That's right! I've gotta ask'm for a note ta get outta class!" Ranma looked around. He was sitting on a street corner in the middle of Nerima. Some people were looking at him oddly. Ranma slowly stood up. He winced. His shoulder hurt. Bad. "Arrgh! How'd this happen?" The answer came to him in a flash of images… "Shampoo?" And then a fresh onslaught of blocked memories hit him. He remembered all the times when he was a cat. When he had first attacked Pops, when he had 'kissed' Akane (He realized now that his cat side was making a desperate attempt to "mate" with her) Every embarrassing moment came back and wouldn't go away.</p><p>It was weird. When he was a cat…everything he did made sense, even more than it did when he was human. And yet he was doing the silliest things…like licking himself at a public street corner. Then he remembered about being a girl. Saying he was a woman, quitting the Art…picking out bras (Ranma shuddered at this.) Again everything seemed so clear…he knew exactly what he wanted then. Not like normal. Not like now.</p><p>He looked at the cars stopping and going. Some of them turned right, some left, some kept going straight… Things weren't so cut and dry for Ranma. He had all these choices, all these things he could be, but how could he choose just one? In a way he was freer than anyone…but…he felt so <i>trapped.</i></p><p>He could feel them now…the cat and the girl…lurking within him… waiting for him to relinquish control. Where had they come from? How did they get there? Who were they? "Who am I?" Ranma asked himself. It was the question Happosai had asked him five lifetimes and half an hour ago. Only now he wasn't so sure of the answer…</p><p>Tofu woke up in his bedroom above the clinic. His head was still pounding out the bass line of the nightclub he and Kasumi went to that night. It was something neither of them had ever done and if the hangover he was experiencing had anything to say about it, they wouldn't be doing it again anytime soon.</p><p>Unless of course she wanted to.</p><p>Tofu shoveled himself out of bed, smeared on his clothes from last night and staggered downstairs.</p><p>Kasumi. Kasumi! KASUMI! GODS! What a woman! How did he ever find her without scouring the heavens and looking in every cloud for an angel? She made him so happy. She was it. She was the one. Only this damn obligation of hers to her family… but even that made her more appealing. He couldn't help himself when he was near her. The merest mention of her sent trills of insane pleasure down his body. He wanted to hold her, to caress her, to kiss her, to tell her how he felt…only he couldn't because she asked him, BEGGED him, to wait until after her family got over her mother's death. He would sooner refuse a heavenly decree than the gentlest of suggestions from Kasumi. Oh but it was so HARD, and finally, FINALLY! His waiting was over. Now he could woo her, and pamper her, and treat her like the princess she deserved to be.</p><p>He shoved his hand in his pocket and looked at the photo sticker they had made of themselves. She was so beautiful…</p><p>He wanted to marry her right away, but she said last night that she wanted to wait, and Tofu wasn't about to push it. In his dream just now…she said the same thing. But the Kasumi in his dream was just a face to say the words that he needed to hear. She was no more the real Kasumi than Betty the skeleton, even if she seemed so incredibly like the original. Ranma was going through the Ijuu. He was going to need Tofu's help today.</p><p>But why did it have to be TODAY?</p><p>Tofu felt an urgent need to drink a few swimming pools full of water. Tofu put the sticker back in his pocket and shuffled to the sink in his slippers. He downed a few glasses off the tap, foreign microbes and added chemicals be damned, and splashed himself in the face with another glass. This made him think of Ranma.</p><p>It was because of Ranma that his wait was over. Ranma just made everyone forget their troubles and concentrate on other things, namely him. At least once a week there'd be another fiancé's crazy plan or another eccentric foreign dignitary with a predilection toward kidnapping and kitchen utensils. And if it weren't for him, Nodoka would not have stayed for any length of time. Tofu was thinking of leaving, his inability to control himself around Kasumi was becoming dangerous, but when Nodoka showed up…Kasumi came by a lot more and gradually, Tofu got to the point where he was no longer a threat to his patients. Tofu owed Ranma a lot, even if Ranma wasn't aware of it. And the poor boy/girl was about to go through something that would shake him to his very roots…If it didn't break him.</p><p>Tofu rubbed his eyes and put his glasses on. He had to get started soon. Feeling marginally better with only an upset stomach and a cerebral elephant parade he went to his library and pulled out three well-weathered volumes. He opened the first: <i>Selected Works of Franz Kafka</i> and turned to the page in Metamorphosis where the main character's family first sees the cockroach he has become. There he found a jagged, thin sliver of metal about the size of a normal bookmarker. He placed this, with care, on the table by the books. Then he opened the second: <i>Ovid's Metamorphosis</i>. At the page with the passage describing how Tiresias is transformed into a woman when he disturbs two mating snakes there was another sliver of metal, this one smooth and wavy. After placing this next to the first he opened <i>Lewis Carrol's Alice in Wonderland</i>. This final sliver had both a wavy and a jagged edge. It was found at a page near the beginning, where Alice hears the Caterpillar's question: "Who are you?"</p><p>Tofu placed the last sliver in between the other two. It was the last piece to a simple puzzle. The other two slivers fit the sides of the third perfectly and when the puzzle was complete there was a yellow glow and the seams disappeared. The three slivers had combined into a single metal sheet. The metal was black with a blue iridescence and made the eyes search for mysteries and secrets within its surface. Tofu knew its secrets, and how to unlock them.</p><p>Placing his right hand on the cool, smooth, metal sheet, he cleared his throat and said the Code: "Only one power…In all of the universe…That of thyself known."</p><p>Glowing a dark blue, the sheet rose, expanded, and thickened until it was the size of a large cigar box. Aside from its eldritch nature and the vast importance of what it held, that's essentially what it was.</p><p>Inside was one of the most powerful artifacts ever constructed. It granted control over the powers of transmogrification and telepathy, but only if its user knew exactly who they were. Only those who had started the Ijuu could use it and for these people it served another purpose…</p><p>It kept them from killing themselves.</p><p>Tofu moved to open the lid but then decided against it. There was no telling what form the artifact would take. It was something different each time it was called, and if it were fragile…and Kasumi happened to show up at the wrong moment…Tofu didn't want to risk destroying the thing that might very well save Ranma's life. Instead, he set about making a cure for his hangover.</p><p>After fifteen minutes or so of preparation, Tofu was just about to enjoy his first sip of hangover cure tea when someone at the door knocked rather loudly. Wincing at the pain this caused him, Tofu sipped at his tea. The door was knocked again, louder this time. Tofu took several long, quick gulps. He had put up a sign last night saying that the clinic would be closed today and not to knock on the door. Couldn't people read?…</p><p>Ranma read the sign again: [Tofu clinic…scribble… for today. Please…scribble scribble … knock] He scratched his head, and then knocked again a few times. Starting to get bored he decided on a shave and a haircut pattern for variation. After trying that out he decided to do the same thing only slower so he would get the point across. Just when he was about to reach the 'haircut' bit again Tofu opened the door. Ranma stared. Tofu's hair was in disarray, his face unshaven and if he went to the airport with the bags he had under his eyes he'd probably have to have them checked…</p><p>"Jeez, doc, ya look like hell!"</p><p>Tofu leaned in the doorway took his glasses off and rubbed the bridge of his nose. "Thanks, Ranma. I was going to go for the Purgatory look, but then I thought," He put his glasses back on, "why not go all out?" Then he saw the four parallel, jagged tears in Ranma's shoulder. Blood was seeping out of the wounds. Ranma must have unconsciously slowed the bleeding with his ki, but the wound would still need to be treated right away to guard against infection. "You don't look so good yourself," Tofu said with a smile as he motioned Ranma in. "What was it, a cat fight?"</p><p>"Um yeah…actually." Ranma walked inside, shucking his shoes off.</p><p>Tofu raised an eyebrow as he shut the door and followed Ranma. "You were fighting a cat?"</p><p>Ranma turned at the entrance to Tofu's office. "Yeah…uh…no…well sorta" He sat down on an examination chair. "It was Shampoo."</p><p>"Hmm?" Tofu looked closer at the claw mark. It started about ten centimeters down the back of Ranma's left shoulder and ended about three centimeters down in the front. Ranma's red shirt still blocked the view too much to tell how much damage there was. "You mind if I tear this?"</p><p>"Huh? Oh sure go ahead. S'already ruined anyway."</p><p>Nodding Tofu tore the shirt from Ranma's arm.</p><p>"OW! The shirt! Not my skin!"</p><p>"Sorry, some of the blood must have dried." It had to be done sometime and Tofu was first and foremost a chiropractor, so he was used to doing painful procedures quickly and when a patient didn't expect it. He tore off the shirt and through the garment in the receptacle marked 'BIOHAZARD.' Tofu found this oddly humorous, but Ranma didn't share his feelings so he set about checking his wound. What Tofu saw confirmed his suspicions and what Ranma said about it being a cat fight. The claw mark definitely started at the back and moved UP which would have been impossible if Ranma had been standing upright. "You were in nekoken mode when this happened?"</p><p>"Yeah…so was Shampoo."</p><p>"Shampoo knows the nekoken?"</p><p>"I dunno doc, she just sorta started actin' like a cat when I did, but whatever it was it was a lot like the nekoken."</p><p>"You remember this?"</p><p>"Yeah. I remember all of it…only it's like a dream or somethin'. Wait a minute…cats. CATS! I can actually say it! They don't scare me no more!"</p><p>"That's rather odd, why do you think that is?"</p><p>"Feh, prolly 'cause I know I can kick all their asses!" Ranma frowned. There was a pause before Ranma continued. "A lot of strange stuff's been happenin' all day, doc. Stranger than usual ya know? And that's sayin' somethin'."</p><p>"Hmm…" Tofu got a small basin from a cabinet under the sink and started to fill it with warm water, then he thought he might as well make sure that it was Ranma who was going through the Ijuu and not some other conflicted martial artist. His dreams were rarely wrong, but he did drink more than usual last night. He turned the hot water off and filled the rest of the basin with cold. "Why weren't you with Akane?" Tofu asked conversationally…</p><p>Ranma's mood darkened immediately. "I…she…I was a cat…she threatened me…I ran away." Akane wasn't attracted to him. That's what he saw when he was a cat. At one time…maybe, but now… nothing. Ranma drew in a ragged breath. And if she wasn't attracted to him, she sure as hell didn't love him. And it was at that moment that Ranma realized that he, in fact, loved her. Ranma felt a lump grow in his throat and her eyes started to mist over…</p><p>Tofu poured the water out of the basin. He refilled it with warm water. He no longer needed any proof. Ranma had just changed from a boy to a girl without any water. He was worried though. Ranma shouldn't be so unstable yet. Then again, Ranma was an exception to every rule about medicine Tofu could think of, why should it be any different with the Ijuu? He dipped a sponge in the basin and started to wash the blood off Ranma's back. Here was another example of how Ranma broke the rules. This wound would have a normal man dead within a few hours of blood loss. At the very least a wound this severe would normally need a great deal of stitches. But for Ranma, this was nothing serious, and to give him stitches would actually impede his healing, aggravating the wound every time he changed forms. Tofu was getting increasingly worried, though about Ranma's crying. She, as it was difficult to think of Ranma as a he at the moment, was doing an awful lot of it…</p><p>"Ranma…do you want to talk about it?"</p><p>Through her tears Ranma felt the warm sponge on her back, soothing and stinging. Overall it felt pretty good. She wished this were something she could count on. That there was someone like Tofu who would be there for her and offer support and…</p><p>"T-Tofu?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Did you know that Akane…had a crush on you?"</p><p>"What!" Tofu almost knocked the basin to the floor. He was almost ten years older than Akane! He knew her when she was in kindergarten! Then again Kasumi was only older by three years. Even if she was extremely…mature for her age. For some reason he always saw Kasumi as being as old, if not older, than he was. She carried about her a mystery that smacked of years of experience. It was one of the reasons he was crazy about her. But Akane…she was just a little kid…who got assaulted by boys who wanted to date her…and wound up in his office, where he would treat her wounds. "Gods!" Tofu exclaimed</p><p>His father warned him about it. "Ono, my boy," he would say, "be careful when you treat girls, a doctor's office can be a aphrodisiac for them if their day hasn't been that good. If you're ever in doubt, get a female nurse or doctor to treat them." But Tofu had thought his father was just being sexist and just dismissed it. He hadn't even considered it when he was treating Akane. Now some of her strange behavior right before Ranma came made more sense.</p><p>"I didn't realize…" Tofu said. Suddenly he had an odd thought. Ranma was currently female. Check. She was having a bad day. Check. He was treating her. Check. She was acting strange. Check check CHECK! And why would she bring up Akane's crush? Tofu put the basin away and nervously got the bandages for Ranma's shoulder. The Ijuu was truly a scary scary thing.</p><p>"You know…she was growing her hair out long for you."</p><p>"I…didn't know, no." Tofu started to wrap a long cloth bandage around Ranma's shoulder, trying very hard not to make any contact with her skin. Tofu wasn't sure if he'd ever be able to treat girls again after this.</p><p>"Well when it got cut, she could've let it grow back right? But she didn't."</p><p>Tofu wrapped the bandaged a couple more times. "I don't understand."</p><p>"I think she didn't grow it out again because I said it was cute."</p><p>"Huh?" Tofu had somehow forgotten that the conversation was about Ranma and not necessarily about Akane's crush on Tofu. "Oh! Well then…excuse me for asking, Ranma, but why are you crying?"</p><p>"It's… been gettin' longer recently."</p><p>"Oh." Tofu finished wrapping the bandage when all that Ranma had said sunk in. "Oh GODS! I'm so sorry Ranma!" Tofu realized why Ranma was crying. Even he had seen signs that Akane wasn't acting the same toward Ranma. He tried to imagine how he'd feel if Kasumi…but thankfully he couldn't imagine that and he hoped he'd never need to experience it. But though he felt for Ranma, he didn't have any words of solace to give or any way of making the situation better…except perhaps by offering a distraction…</p><p>"Ranma…I have something for you. It might take your mind off things for a bit."</p><p>"Um…okay."</p><p>Ranma tried not to think of Tofu naked. Thinking of Akane certainly didn't help. And any mental assertions that she was mentally a man fell on mentally deaf mental ears. The only thing that seemed to make things a little better was thinking of Kasumi and that she DESERVED Tofu.</p><p>Ranma tried not to think of Kasumi and Tofu naked…</p><p>"It's just in the other room," Tofu said as he stood up from behind Ranma and walked toward the door. "I'll be right back." Tofu noticed Ranma's bare female chest. "I'll get a shirt for you too while I'm at it." He mumbled and left…</p><p>Ranma looked at what remained of her shirt beside her… She wondered if she should take her pants off. DAMMIT! What's wrong with me? I love Akane!…But she doesn't love me. And Tofu's a GUY! Ranma felt a wave of iciness course through her. so?… I'm a MAN!… again- so? …But that's WRONG!… who says? my father? my mother? akane? why should i listen to them? why should i listen to anybody? what does it matter if i'm a girl or a guy?… maybe i could seduce tofu… then i could kill akane and blackmail him into helping me hide the evidence… then i could kill him… then i won't have to worry about my heart being broken. "No," Ranma said out loud quietly. "Because then I wouldn't have one." Ranma felt the terrible emptiness she felt this morning… only worse. It was getting worse…But… she had stopped crying.</p><p>Very well then…who needs a heart anyway?</p><p>Tofu came back with a shirt and the multidimensional cigar box. The air around the door to the room was cold. He got the distinct feeling that something was wrong. He called out "Ranma? Are you okay in there?"</p><p>"Sure, babe, why don't you come inside so you can see the view?"</p><p>Yes something was definitely wrong. He probably shouldn't go in the room. It was probably extremely dangerous. Tofu might even die. Yes, it would probably be best if he just left for awhile…Tofu sighed. He went into the room.</p><p>"Like what you see?" Ranma gestured to her completely naked body. "I might as well tell you that I find you attractive, since there's no point in my raising a fuss about being a man. How could I be a man? The only woman I ever loved hates me. "</p><p>Tofu was a doctor. The naked body didn't normally phase him, unless he thought of someone whose name begins with 'Ka.' Tofu looked straight into Ranma's eyes. "Ranma, listen to yourself. This is not you."</p><p>"Oh? Who is it then? No my dear Tofu you're wrong. It IS me. It's ALWAYS been me. But my honor, my petty need for human contact has kept me in check. Well fuck that. Who will give me what I need? Pop? Don't be ridiculous. Mom? She'd rather kill me. Akane? She just wants me dead. You? You love Kasumi, and that takes care of her too. Nabiki sees me as a piece of ass, Shampoo, Kodachi, and Ukyo all want me as some trophy they can fuck when they get bored. Tell me, Tofu, what reason do I have not to kill every last one of you?"</p><p>This WAS bad. Tofu murmured something under his breath: "At my darkest hour, I shall become a pillar of light. I shall see the path before me and go forth. I shall ward evil away with the power of my determination, and use the light of my soul to find the truth." It was the Litany Against Desperation…one of twelve different litanies he learned as member of the Flock.</p><p>"Yes lets look at the truth shall we. Cold, hard, facts." The room became even colder. Painfully cold. "For some reason the soul of ice has become more than just a metaphor. I wonder how cold I can make it…"</p><p>"St-st-stop this Ranma!" Tofu shivered. He inhaled more of the frigid air and forced himself to say something, anything to get Ranma to stop. "You are being more positively STUPID now than you have ever been! I DO love you! You're like a little brother, heck maybe someday you'll BE my brother…or sister… it doesn't matter. If it wasn't for you I could have never have been able to stay with Kasumi. She loves you too I know it! Your father is misdirected, but if he didn't care about you why would he bother with you at all? And your mother doesn't know you're her son! She might yet welcome you! I can't speak for your fiancées but I'm sure they aren't as bad as you make them out to be. If you want love Ranma look around! Don't close your eyes because of one instance of unrequited affection!" The room warmed considerably in the silence that followed.</p><p>Finally Ranma spoke, "You do raise one or two good points. I'll think about it. Are you going to give me the shirt or shall we continue as we are?"</p><p>Tofu stopped opening and closing his mouth and tossed the shirt to Ranma who promptly pulled it over her head. It was a black T-shirt that Tofu usually wore under his gi when the weather got colder. "How long have you been having these…mood swings, Ranma?"</p><p>"Mood swings? Tofu, I think you and I both know this is more than just a mood swing."</p><p>Tofu nodded dumbly. He should have been more prepared for this…but it was all so shocking. If it weren't for the different timbre to the voice and the fact that he could see Ranma right in front of him, Tofu would have sworn that Nabiki had just said that.</p><p>"What was that you were saying earlier? It sounded like an incantation or a ritual…Do you belong to some secret society or something?"</p><p>Yep, nail on the head. Tofu grimaced. Ranma was always observant, Akane told him once how Ranma had known he was a martial artist. There had been other times when his true intelligence peeped through. Coming up with the last move of the Hiryuu Shoten Ha on his own for instance. But Tofu was never there when it happened, and he could never be sure whether it was some chance inspiration. Now there wasn't any doubt, no one could so successfully be Nabiki, unless they were at least as intelligent as Nabiki. But the question was...how much could he tell Ranma without endangering her progress through the Ijuu?</p><p>"Yes, Ranma, I do belong to a 'secret society.' I hope you don't mind if I don't say more, as I prefer it stay secret for now. You're right. They aren't mood swings. They're more like personality swings. What you are going through…its sort of like multiple personality disorder, only it's more than just psychological, and the personalities you exhibit are just amplifications of aspects of your own personality."</p><p>Like one picture fading into another Ranma went from acting like Nabiki to acting like…someone else. "Interesting. Akane was telling me that I was acting like her sisters and Ukyo earlier I didn't notice, but she did get pretty angry."</p><p>Tofu couldn't place this new personality. It was cold and logical, even more so than Nabiki, and there was an undercurrent of bitterness. "Yes that's probably because those are the people you are around the most. You see this normally too. If you hang around a group of people long enough, you tend to pick up some of their body movements, their quirks, their speech patterns what have you. Often in dreams, the people we know become metaphors for the feelings we associate with them."</p><p>"Dreams. This started with a dream I think."</p><p>"It usually does. What you are going through is a test, Ranma, among other things. The test concerns not only you, but all of the aspects of you. It is extremely dangerous. It can ruin your life, turn you into a shell of a person, or worse, it can drive you to acts you would normally die to prevent."</p><p>"I suppose that would explain why I have been obsessing about killing Akane from time to time."</p><p>Tofu suddenly felt like he had bitten off WAY more than he could chew. Ranma was obsessing on KILLING Akane? But this was Ranma! Ranma would never… Right. Ijuu. Maybe there was some other explanation though. Tofu took a wild shot in the dark. "Ranma? What do you think of when you think of Akane?"</p><p>"I'm not sure, anger perhaps."</p><p>Tofu relaxed a little. "I think that is what you really want to kill. Anger. Not just Akane's but your own. Akane is a metaphor of sorts, of anger."</p><p>"Hmm… maybe…but if that's it…then I don't think it's anger."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Because I don't just want to kill Akane, I want to annihilate her, disintegrate her, I want her inhumed and blown to the four winds. No, now that I think about it…she doesn't mean anger to me. That's looking at the surface. If she is a metaphor for anything…it's love."</p><p>Tofu didn't know what to say. This was so unlike Ranma…so unlike anyone he had met. His mentor had said that talking to some one first entering the Ijuu was like talking to a brick wall. This was like talking to an avalanche! Tofu did nothing but stare when Ranma started to get extremely red in the face…</p><p>Ranma was extremely embarrassed. How could she behave so rudely? And she exposed herself to Tofu! How could she do such a thing? She put on the boy's underwear and pants hurriedly. She really hated having to wear such things but they were all she had, and besides she might turn into a boy again at any moment…</p><p>"I'm so sorry Tofu-sensei! I've been through so much today…I would never hurt Akane! She's my best friend! I don't know what made me say such horrid things."</p><p>"Are you Ranko now?" Tofu asked, trying to make some sense out of things.</p><p>Ranma stiffened, "Please don't call me that, Tofu-sensei. I positively hate that name! I can't be anything more than a niece to my mother because of it. Ranma's a nice name for a girl too, just call me that okay?"</p><p>"Okay. Ranma, do you remember why you came here?"</p><p>"Yes, I do. It's all so scary! All these other personalities in control! I'm glad you didn't see what happened this morning! Poor Grandfather Happosai almost died! I wish they'd all just go away. The bad ones anyway. I guess I don't mind acting like Ucchan or Kasumi-oneechan every now and then… I just want a pass so I don't have to go to school. I couldn't stand it if I hurt someone else."</p><p>School…after the surreality of what had just happened it was difficult to imagine such a banal concept. "I'll…write you a pass, don't worry…Ranma, you said you wouldn't mind acting like Kasumi or Ukyo… aren't there some other personalities you don't mind?"</p><p>"Well, I guess I do kind of like acting like Nabiki, though she's kind of sneaky. But I don't like the others. Even Akane…she's my best friend, but I don't want to act like her."</p><p>"What about Ranma…I mean your main personality?"</p><p>"I'm sorry, Tofu-sensei, I don't understand. I'm Ranma. I'm the main personality!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You'll have to forgive me, I keep forgetting that everyone thinks I'm a boy. That Ranma isn't the real me. That's not even a personality like the others. That Ranma is just me, only more confused and turned around. That Ranma is just the chains that I had to put on to survive with Mr. Octopus Face, excuse me" Ranma giggled, "my father."</p><p>"But, weren't you born a boy?"</p><p>"I suppose…I really don't have any memories before 'Pus-face took me on that awful training trip. You know my life, Tofu-sensei, anything is possible. Even if I was born a boy, that hardly matters. I'm a woman now. When Akane knocked me into the pond it all became clear to me. Everything fell into place. I woke up from that terrible nightmare and I felt free for the first time in all my life. Then when she knocked me back it clouded over again." Ranma's expression darkened a little, "Akane's my best friend, but she can be… irritating at times."</p><p>Ranma was giving a disturbingly convincing argument. "I don't mean to pressure you, Ranma, but this is all coming out of left field for me here. Just a little while ago you said you loved Akane, and now you're saying she's your best friend. Now I know that you weren't talking about friendly, platonic love before…"</p><p>"Tofu-sensei…I'd really rather not talk about that…"</p><p>"I'm sorry but it's kind of important."</p><p>"Can't it wait? I'm really not in the mood to discuss it right now…"</p><p>"I just want to know…"</p><p>"Look, back off okay? If I'm a girl and I love another girl whadya think that makes me?"</p><p>Ranma was back. Or was SHE gone again?…</p><p>"Are you a girl, Ranma?"</p><p>"Hell no!…DAMMIT! This is freakin' me out! " Ranma was so sure, a moment ago that she was girl. Now everything was muddy again. Was she a girl? Ranma wasn't even sure if she was born male or not anymore. No, even if she was born a girl she was still a man now. Ranma equals man. End of story...</p><p>Tofu's headache never had completely gone away, and now it was returning with a vengeance. Tofu used his right thumb and middle finger to rub his temples. "To tell you the truth, Ranma, it's freaking me out too." Tofu realized he still had the metal cigar box in his other hand. Almost as an afterthought he tossed it to Ranma. "Open it. I'm not sure what it will look like or how you will need to use it, but I can't let you leave here without it. Not after what I just saw you go through."</p><p>Ranma looked at the box but did not open it. "Huh? This got somethin' ta do with all the weird shit in my brain?"</p><p>"Yes. It's called the Saiserefu Noon. It will protect you and the others around you from… yourself."</p><p>Ranma looked at the box again. "What's wrong with me, doc? I wanna trust ya but I get edgy when people hide stuff from me."</p><p>Tofu sighed. He had been hiding the name of Ranma's predicament from him since he got there. If he told it to him, that one piece of information could tip the sensitive scales of fate against Ranma. But if he didn't, Ranma might do something…rash. "Ranma, It's called the Ijuu."</p><p>"The migration? What the hell does a migration got to do with going psycho at a pin drop?"</p><p>"It's an analogy of sorts. Just as birds migrate south when the weather gets too cold, so the aspects of your soul change location when your emotional environment becomes too perilous."</p><p>"If ya ask me that's pretty weak."</p><p>"I suppose it is." Tofu said absently. Ranma's personalities were already beginning to merge. The old Ranma wouldn't even know what an analogy was, much less whether it was weak or not…or at least he wouldn't admit to it.</p><p>Ranma opened the box. She started laughing.</p><p>"What's so funny, Ranma?"</p><p>"Aw come on, this is a joke right? Where's the real Saise-watchamacallit?"</p><p>"I'm afraid that's it."</p><p>Ranma stopped laughing. She looked inside the box again. "You sure?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"What the hell is this then!" Ranma took the Saiserefu Noon out of the box.</p><p>Tofu looked closer, adjusting his glasses. It was a pair of butterfly earrings, made from the same strange metal as the box. They glowed an eerie blue and were very beautiful. "It looks like a pair of pretty earrings." Tofu commented.</p><p>"I KNOW that! What am I s'posed ta do with 'em?"</p><p>Tofu noticed something he overlooked before…They were made for pierced ears.</p><p>Tofu swallowed. He turned around. He found a sturdy section of wall and butted it with his head repeatedly in frustration. Why was this proving so difficult?</p><p>"Hey Tofu, man, stop doin' that, you're gonna damage somethin'"</p><p>Tofu stopped, resting his forehead on the wall. "Sorry, Ranma, this hasn't been that great a morning for me either."</p><p>"Hey, no problem, believe me, I understand. But…how're we gonna deal with this? I mean even if I wanted ta I couldn't wear these things."</p><p>"I don't know, Ranma." Tofu sighed, turned around and slid his back down the wall so that he was sitting facing Ranma. He took his glasses off and rubbed his aching temples with his thumb and middle finger. "All I know is I can't let you leave here without them in. It's too dangerous."</p><p>Ranma looked at the earrings in the palm of her hand. While Tofu was mainly a chiropractor, he was also licensed as a general practitioner. Chances are there would be something to pierce ears with and if Ranma couldn't leave without having the earrings on…Yes, there was really only one thing she could do…</p><p>"So, Doc, where'm I gonna sleep?"</p><p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~</p><p>Sorry it took so long to bring this out. I couldn't figure out how to transition from chapter 2 to here. I ended up just deciding not to worry about it and write the scene that I liked first. So I started with Shampoo. I actually have a large part of chapter four already written but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.</p><p>It gets weirder.</p><p>I've decided to axe the glossary. If you don't know a word, there's an excellent site</p><p>.com/cgi-bin/j-e/dict</p><p>where you can find pretty much anything you'll be likely to see in fanfictions (Verbs and adjectives are tricky though) You won't find Saiserefu Noon. though. Just say that five times fast and you'll know what it means. Japanese is fun:-)</p>
