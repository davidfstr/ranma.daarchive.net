</div><p>Thyself  Known</p><p>Ch. 4: Neon Green</p><p>By Zorknot</p><p>DISCLAIMER:  Ranma ½ and its characters all belong to Takahashi Rumiko and her cohorts. The  voices in my head made me do it.</p><p>WHAT HAS COME  BEFORE: Ranma had a semi-lucid dream that caused the trigger of his curse to  change. Now he's a girl when he feels girlie. He also  changes his personalities to deal with whatever situation hits him. After  having a major argument with Akane, injuring Happosai, almost raping Shampoo  while in the Nekoken, and attempting to seduce Dr. Tofu, all in the space of  some four hours, Ranma's extremely unstable. Tofu has a solution, but can Ranma  be convinced to pierce his ears and wear a pair of pretty earrings? It's not exactly  going well for anyone else either. Nabiki for one is getting eerie déjà vu from  the whole mess...</p><p>~~~~~[BEGIN]~~~~~</p><p><i>"But before help comes, slowly,  imperceptibly at first, the entire consciousness of Phaedrus  begins to come apart... to dissolve and fade away. Then gradually he no longer  wonders what will happen next. He knows what will happen next, and tears flow  for his family and for himself and for this world."</i></p><p>-Robert M. Pirsig <i>Zen and the  Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.</i></p><p>Nabiki left her home wearing her blue school  uniform and carrying her satchel. The satchel contained her laptop, her  graphing calculator, and an abacus as well as the requisite notebooks, pencils  and papers. Whenever possible she liked to use her abacus because it kept her  mind sharp, and it kept her more valuable equipment from being seen by people  who would be inclined to steal it.</p><p>This was not of course her only deterrent.  Her computer had been stolen a grand total of twice. The first time was by a senior  who had later found his little prank had caused him to be re-registered at  Furinkan as a Freshman girl named Aima  Horu. (Only in Nerima, where one's appearance did not  necessarily indicate one's sex was this possible.) He had to change two of his  classes and he was effectively barred from sports for a year before he was able  to fix the problem. Also back then the uniform rule was more strictly  enforced...</p><p>Nabiki could have bought four laptops from  the money she got from the betting pools that year.</p><p>The other time the laptop was stolen by a  girl in Nabiki's own class who had wanted revenge for losing a fair bet.</p><p>Akane made lunch the next day.</p><p>Nabiki made the switch.</p><p>When the girl came back to school again after  a week of recuperating she gave the laptop back to Nabiki without saying a  word. No one had stolen anything from Nabiki since.</p><p>She took her time walking away from the place  she had lived her entire life. She was feeling introspective and she wasn't at  all worried about being late. Sooner than she would like, she would have to  move away. Away from the problems of Furinkan. Away from the complex life of Ranma Saotome. Away from the  warm blanket of her mother's influence that hung around the house even so many  years since her death. It was so comforting one minute, but then so stifling  the next.</p><p>Her mother was dead. On days like today she  wished she wasn't. On days like today she wished it was someone else's job to  make sense of everything, because right now, Nabiki had no idea what was going  on.</p><p>Nabiki sighed as she approached the Tomo  residence, the second house along the road. <i>No</i>,  she thought, <i>that isn't true. I know  exactly what's going on. At least part of it.</i></p><p>Four or five minutes  ago, hurricane Akane and typhoon Ranma had left for school, leaving Nabiki and  the others to contemplate the aftermath. Nabiki's thoughts at that moment had  been first that it was rather silly for Ranma to go to school, but then she  thought back, and remembered how strange Happosai had acted, the mind control,  him telling her she was "scary enough as it is" and how it didn't seem like a  joke. Then she remembered Ranma and how cold the redhead's expression was. How  it reminded her of a different face. One she saw in the bathroom one horrible  night. Directly in front of her and above the sink...</p><p>She had left the house and now she was here,  walking to the Tomos' garage. When she got there,  Nabiki knocked on the aluminum slats of the garage door. She smiled slightly at  the irony. Ranma and Akane were martial artists. Even Akane could, if she so  chose, try out for the Olympics and no doubt place in almost any event...  except of course swimming. Nabiki, on the other hand, was not an athlete. And  yet even though Ranma and Akane ran as fast as they could to get to school on  time every morning, Nabiki always got there before them.</p><p>The garage door opened, revealing a highly  modified neon green Model G Honda moped. Next to it was a more traditional red  and black Yamaha motorcycle. The motorcycle belonged to Nabiki's friend and  compatriot, Hoko Tomo. The moped...was Nabiki's. Both bikes sat next to a  slightly discolored space in the floor where the Tomo car was kept when it  wasn't being used.</p><p>To Nabiki's mild surprise the person who had  opened up the garage door was not Hoko, but her mother.</p><p>"Good morning, Nabiki-chan," Tomo-san  greeted with a slight bow of her head as she released her finger from the  button on the right wall that opened the door.</p><p>"Good morning, Tomo-san." Nabiki bowed  deeper to show respect, however she could never bring herself to take her eyes  off anyone...something she retained from her childhood long ago, when she still  practiced the Art. Her friends and associates sometimes remarked that this was  unsettling. "Is there anything wrong?"</p><p>"Nothing to worry about... Just...Hoko-chan  has a fever this morning so she can't go to school. I called Tofu's office but  the message said he was closed for the day. I hope he opens again soon... I  just don't trust those hospital doctors." Hoko's mother was wearing a flowery  house dress and slippers. Even though the days were pleasantly warm now, the  mornings could still be chilly. A slight draft whispered through Tomo-san's dress and made her grab her bare and suddenly goose  pimpled arms.</p><p>She was an attractive woman in a motherly  sort of way. Right now, however Nabiki felt like she could count all the years  on the middle-aged woman's face. "Well, tell her I hope she gets better soon."  Nabiki walked to her moped and lifted the helmet off the back. Nabiki looked  back at Hoko's mother staring outside and rubbing her arms. "It's probably just  the temperature change. I know a few people, they <i>always</i> get sick around this time."</p><p>Tomo-san turned  her head back toward Nabiki as if surprised, "Yes. Yes, you're probably right.  People get sick all the time. It's nothing to worry about." Tomo-san smiled  weakly, and turned back away.</p><p>Nabiki nodded hesitantly and put her helmet  on. She got her keys out of her book bag and sat on the bike. She kicked the  kickstand back. She paused for a moment. "I'll check by Dr. Tofu's after school  today if you want..."</p><p>Tomo-san gave a small nod</p><p>Nabiki put the keys in and revved the engine.  She rolled out of the garage and looked back once more at Hoko's mom. She  lifted a hand for goodbye and Tomo-san absently followed suit. Then Nabiki sped  away as the garage door started to whir slowly closed.</p><p>Nabiki always had a knack for reading people.  It was glaringly obvious to her that Tomo-san was, in fact, extremely worried.  A part of her wanted to make Hoko's mom feel better, but what could she say? It  was just a cold? It didn't mean anything? There were enough life-threatening  diseases out there that started out as colds that there was no way she could be  sure that was true. And Nabiki couldn't tell Hoko's mom that...Even if part of  her wanted to see her cry, wanted to see the terror and sorrow in her eyes.  Even if part of her wanted Hoko to get sick and die so she wouldn't have to  worry about her anymore...</p><p>No, the overriding feeling was that it was  none of her business. Best to distance herself from it.  Think about something else.</p><p>So Nabiki just let the cool morning wind  refresh her as she sped down the road. Every now and then her uniform skirt  would flip up, revealing the short shorts Nabiki wore underneath. Nabiki  smiled. Somehow she had managed to keep her obsession secret far longer than  she had thought possible. Nabiki loved secrets and the bike was a big one.</p><p>There was more to it than that though.</p><p>Nabiki increased her speed as she reached a  busy street. Soon she was generating a lot of wind and dodging vehicles and  pedestrians like Pac-man on speed. Many colorful expletives were uttered at  her, but if Nabiki heard them at all, they were distorted by a massive Doppler  effect.</p><p>On a bike the world spun differently.  Navigating through the obstructions presented Nabiki with a fresh onslaught of  problems that had nothing to do with normal life...and everything to do with  it. Sometimes when it looked like she was going to take a heavy loss in the  betting pool or in the stocks she imagined herself on the street riding...and  suddenly she would know exactly what to do.</p><p>Nabiki accelerated. The Model G was the  cheapest bike she could find. As her business extended outside Furinkan High to  other parts of Tokyo, she needed a mode of transport. As the money started  pouring in, she bought parts for the bike and modified it. Right now the  speedometer was showing about 150kmh. This was a good cruising speed. Just enough to provide Nabiki with a challenge.</p><p>When he saw the neon green blur, Kawagami Hiro revved up the engine of his police  motorcycle, spat out a wad of gum and put his silver sunglasses on with his  left hand. There was no way she was going to escape him this time. She was  fast, but she had to slow down sooner or later. He would catch this crazy bitch  once and for all. He kicked back his kick stand and sped out on to the street,  becoming a loud black and white blur of movement. Hiro flicked on his lights  almost as an after thought as he pursued his prey.</p><p>Nabiki saw the cop in her shaking mirror and  smiled. The man was pathetic. He had been trying to catch her for two weeks  now, but it was always the same story. She would lose him, and she would still  arrive at her destination with time to spare. In front of her, two large trucks  loomed, side by side, stopped at the red light. Without giving the situation a  second thought, she passed on their right, merged into the leftward moving  traffic, u-turned into the rightward moving traffic and turned left onto her  original street.  She knew Number 542,  safety freak that he was, would stop at the light until the traffic died down.  She sped through the relatively stationary vehicles a little more leisurely  now, only going about 120 kilometers per hour or so. She loved this. In fact,  there was only one thing Nabiki loved more…</p><p>Hiro cursed at the scooter as it sped away. The four dollar signs  on the license plate seemed to be laughing at him. Fortunately the light turned  green only a second or two after the girl completed her little stunt. Hiro  smiled. No, she wasn't going to slip by this time.</p><p>Of course the modifications weren't the only  reason Nabiki could go so fast. She was also a damned good driver. Hoko had  introduced Nabiki to the motorbike world and her friend was amazed at how  easily Nabiki took to it. Nabiki didn't have any explanation except that her  hand eye coordination was still pretty good from her training. The coordination  exercises had begun almost immediately after she was born, and that sort of  thing doesn't go away. She didn't mention this to Hoko though. The last thing  she needed was everyone thinking she knew martial arts. She had enough trouble  explaining the dojo. The cars in front of Nabiki stopped. She drove onto the  side walk and dodged past a few people before hitting the road again. She was a  little worried about Ranma…</p><p>Hiro stared at what the girl did. How could  anyone be so disrespectful of other people? How could she risk so many lives?  How could she show such disregard for the Law? How could she be so amazing….?  Hiro shook his head free of that last thought. The girl, whoever she was, was  an accident waiting to happen. She had to be brought down. Hiro didn't deny  that he would take great pleasure in THAT. He followed as best he could without  endangering any innocents…</p><p>Ranma had reminded Nabiki so much of herself  this morning. What she saw in his eyes… it made her remember that terrible time  after mother died and before she found her second love. She was obsessed with  money and even at the fragile age of ten, she was planning the family budget  and making small time business transactions. Nabiki was a genius by most  standards, and she often took pride in that, but as a genius she found few  friends and so had to harden herself against the world.</p><p>Nabiki saw that 542 was  gaining on her. She slowed down just enough and made a sharp left turn into a  long alley way.</p><p>As dumpsters and fire escapes whizzed past  her, Nabiki thought of how fast her so-called childhood had passed her by.  Nabiki smiled, melancholy at the few happy moments,  when Daddy wasn't so bad, or when one of her schemes paid off better than  expected. She was just starting then, though and most of her attempts to make  money were massive failures.</p><p>Akane grew increasingly intolerable. She  seemed to lord it over Nabiki that she was a martial artist and that Nabiki was  not, even though she knew that Nabiki had quit along with Kasumi after Mom  died.</p><p>Nabiki grimaced. She knew a lot of people.  Associates she dealt with during business transactions... Many of them would  tell her the short version of their life story in a vain attempt to gain  sympathy. What struck Nabiki about the majority of these stories was how the transition  from childhood to adulthood could be so smooth. Nabiki saw the dead end of the  alley approaching her and she prepared for it as she thought about how her  childhood ended. She knew the precise moment when it did...</p><p>...It was the moment when she took the gun.</p><p>Nabiki sped toward the dead end, but instead  of slowing down, she increased her speed, and just a meter before she reached  it, she veered right. Her front wheel went up a broken piece of furniture a  homeless man was using as a lean-to, and farther up onto the side of the alley  way.  Nabiki was fully horizontal to the  ground for a moment. Then, just before the front wheel reached the face of the  building that marked the dead end, Nabiki ollied the  neon green Model G away from the wall and   turned the wheel to a precise angle, hitting the face of the building at  just the right vector so that the bike would roll down instead of crashing. She  sped down the building for a split second before she hit the street again with  a bone rattling jolt, followed soon after by a jarring thud as the back end of  the bike hit the ground.</p><p>All this took maybe a second, and she had  lost only a little speed.</p><p>Hiro, having followed the girl into the alley  was extremely surprised when she passed him from the opposite direction at such  a speed. He didn't know what he saw when the crazy girl had reached the dead  end. He knew what he THOUGHT he saw, but THAT was impossible. Stunned and  frustrated, he couldn't help feeling a little embarrassed that his own turn around  wasn't nearly as graceful. In his surprise he tried to do a U-turn. He ended up  falling over and skidding along the pavement a meter or so. He was pretty sure  his clothes were ruined and his left side was at least severely bruised.</p><p>"Itte."  He murmured managing to capture feelings of anger, defeat, and outright pain in  the two syllables.</p><p>Suddenly he smiled. He had gotten a good look  at the driver finally. That wasn't just any ugly blue dress she was wearing...  That was a Furinkan High uniform.</p><p>Now if this were any normal speeder, Hiro  would radio headquarters and tell them where she was headed so that she could  be arrested, but this wasn't just a one time thing. She had managed to  practically disappear again and again. She out maneuvered him so fast that he  couldn't even give her position over the mic. Hiro  was the fastest biker on the force. His reputation was on the line.</p><p>This was personal.</p><p>Hiro picked himself and his motorcycle up and  checked himself. No major injuries, though he'd feel like hell tomorrow. It was  amazing really that he hadn't suffered more. He revved the bike's engine again,  it sounded good. His favorite sunglasses had fallen off and now lay cracked on  the ground. Hiro sighed, and put his second pair on, these were just as over  sized as the others but were only darkly tinted as opposed to silvered. That  girl would PAY! He drove out of the alley, and down  the road at a normal, sane person's pace. He stopped at a public phone. He put  his card in and dialed.</p><p>"Hey, Ryu,  ya there? Listen I've got a favor to ask... Oh  nothin' much, I just want you to organize a few  things when I give a signal..." After Hiro finished explaining what he wanted he drove to Furinkan high school, purposely taking his time.  He found a nice shady area where he could see all the traffic in and out and  waited.</p><p>Nabiki liked school well enough, but the  actual getting taught part of it could get tedious at times. She generally kept  to the back of the class so she could plan out her business transactions  without the teacher knowing.</p><p>First period was history, a class Nabiki  could ace fairly easily as long as she didn't pay any attention to the teacher  and read the book. If she paid any attention to the teacher, the whole thing  got muddied up because the fool kept getting the names and dates wrong. Today  though, after parking her bike and meeting some associates before the bell, she  had sat down in History and couldn't bring herself to work on her ledger.</p><p>"Now what we're going to talk about today is  very important to remember class," Omo-sensei began,  "Today we're going to talk about World War Two."</p><p>"Now who can tell me what day 'Pac-man' was  dropped on Hiroshima?"</p><p>A girl in the front raised her hand. She  always raised her hand.</p><p>"Yes, Juri, what's  the answer."</p><p>"My name is Arisu,  sensei"</p><p>"Ah, so it is. So what date was 'Riddle  ploy' dropped on Hiroshima?"</p><p>"You mean 'Little boy?'"</p><p>"Yes, what was the date of that great tragedy  in Okinawa?"</p><p>"Um, Okinawa, sir?"</p><p>"No, that's incorrect. Anybody?"</p><p>The other students knew by now not to try to  answer.</p><p>Sometimes Arisu  would leave the classroom crying.</p><p>"I'm saddened by this generation's lack of  national pride. This is an important time. The Germans devastated two of our  cities with their nuclear families! Trillions died!"</p><p>Nabiki watched all this from the back room as  if it was an absurd dream. It was sad, Oma-sensei  actually knew more about history than almost anyone, but while he could write  it down just fine, if he had to speak, everything went out the window. Once  someone suggested he could try singing. That had worked, but he had such an  awful voice he had to stop. It sounded about as bad as Akane's cooking tasted.</p><p>Nuclear families...Nabiki had been in one  once. It was hard to imagine now. She could still remember Mom. She could still  remember being a kid. But she couldn't remember how the politics of it had  worked. What had Akane done when she wasn't the only martial artist? What had  Kasumi done when Mom was the one that cooked? What had Daddy done when Mom was  still there? As Nabiki tried to put it together in her mind Oma-sensei  equivocated to the class until the bell for second period sounded, breaking  Nabiki's reverie.</p><p>Second period was first semester Calculus . Normally Nabiki was more active in this class.  She knew Calculus already, but she found a certain joy in solving problems and  getting them right. But today she could barely pay attention.</p><p>"Nabiki?" Anguru-sensei jolted Nabiki out of her woolgathering.</p><p>"Sorry, sensei, what was the question  again?"</p><p>"When you take the derivative of a tangent  line, what do you get."</p><p>Nabiki frowned. This was a pretty simple  question. "A slope, a constant rate of change."</p><p>"Right so what do you need to draw the  line?"</p><p>"A point. Specifically, the point where the tangent line touches the graph of  the function."</p><p>"Thank you. You may go back to your dreams  of world domination now."</p><p>The other five people in the room chuckled.</p><p>Furinkan High was not all that big on  academia.</p><p>What WAS the point? Why was Nabiki feeling so  off today? It was Ranma of course. He was the function. And the point...that look in his eyes...that look of deadness...That's  what was pulling Nabiki along this tangent. She didn't want to remember the day  she had seen that look before. She didn't want to, but she knew...she had to.</p><p>Nabiki got up from her chair. The teacher  nearly dropped her chalk in surprise. Without even excusing herself, Nabiki  left the room. She stopped by her locker to retrieve her shoes and after a  moments hesitation, she but her satchel in as well. She should be back before  school was out.</p><p>She left Furinkan and its betting pools and social  circles. She found her bike, put her helmet on, and took off. She needed the  bike right now. The sense of freedom. The speed. Most of all though, she needed  the privacy.</p><p>Hiro had thought he would have to wait until  school was out. He had been just about ready to go buy something to eat for  lunch when the green demon chick came tearing out of the school grounds like a  bat out of hell. "Hey hey, playin'  hooky on top of it all... this gets better'n better."  He smiled and picked up the mic from it's cradle. "Anyone out there wanna make a quick buck?" That was the signal. Hiro  would probably catch hell for using police frequencies for something like that  but it would be worth it if he could catch this girl and find out what the hell  her problem was. He wondered idly what her name was...He frowned, not that it  fucking mattered. He gunned the engine violently and took off after the Model  G.</p><p>Nabiki sped along the road. She had to start  at the beginning. The memory was too raw to just go right into it. She thought  about the end of her childhood, the gun.</p><p>At fifteen, Nabiki was starting to get into  more dangerous deals, and she was spending more and more time in the...shadier  parts of Tokyo. She had a paid bodyguard by the name of  Ichiro she had follow her. He was extremely large for an Asian and until that  day she hadn't had any major problems. That day though  something had gone wrong. Just before she and Ichiro got to the meeting  point she heard gun shots... Her contact then came running, his eyes wide.</p><p>"Quick, take this! I'll pay you back later!"  and he threw something at Nabiki, which she caught.</p><p>It was a gun.</p><p>The man had owed Nabiki money and was meeting  her to pay her back. Apparently he also owed the Yakuza money. Through some  freakish stroke of luck he had escaped them by taking the leader's gun. Nabiki  never found out more than that. She had decided she wanted no more dealings  with the man.</p><p>The reasoning behind keeping the gun seemed  so clear to her at the time. She felt that Akane was right, she wasn't a  martial artist, and so she needed some form of protection. Japan had strict gun laws, but she could still  practice shooting in the sewers under Tokyo with bullets bought through the black  market. She had gotten quite good, and she enjoyed it, but she hadn't realized  how much she had lost.</p><p>She hadn't realized until the day that Akane  threatened her.</p><p>It was really stupid. Akane wanted to go see  a movie with her friends only she didn't have any money. She asked Nabiki for  some but Nabiki said, rightly, that they didn't have enough. This was before  the massive windfall Nabiki experienced when Kuno issued his challenge... and  funds were EXTREMELY tight. She had already had to fire Ichiro, and she was  very close to pawning some of the security equipment she had invested in over  the years. Then Akane said, half jokingly, that she could just take the money  from Nabiki by force if she wanted to.</p><p>Nabiki loved her sisters and father, but even  with them, she was cold as ice when money or something equally serious was  concerned. And the mere idea that Akane, could THINK that she could do such a  thing…it awakened something dark in Nabiki…and she pulled out her gun.</p><p>Nabiki grew aware of a sound. A rhythmic "whump"ing sound that seemed  to be following her, getting closer. It reminded her of the sound of her  heart that day, when she held the gun pointed at Akane's forehead and she saw  the fear in her sister's eyes...</p><p>Nabiki realized with a shake of her head  that the sound was not from her memory but was above her. She looked up. "A helicopter?"  The  craft was almost right on top of her, big as a house. In Nabiki's shock, she  failed to see the car in front of her… until it was too late.</p><p>Nabiki tried to swerve and do a wheelie at  the same time, but her body knew before she did that this maneuver wouldn't  work. She launched herself on to the side walk and watched her bike speed up  the low frame of a car and spin into the air. She noted its trajectory as  coldly as she had noted the sweat rolling down Akane's temple. It was headed  spinning toward a woman and her baby.</p><p>A darkness she had  lived with for two years now wanted the bike to make contact, to cause DAMAGE,  to DESTROY. It was the same darkness that made Nabiki cock  the pistol… that made her finger grow tighter against the cool trigger of the  loaded gun.</p><p>She had wanted Akane to die then. She CRAVED  it. She NEEDED to see blood seep from a wound that would never heal. But she  loved her sister. She didn't want to see her hurt. She didn't want to see  anybody hurt. No. NO! "NOOOOOOOOOO!"</p><p>Nabiki felt some burning thing tear from her  just before the concrete slammed into her shoulder.</p><p>Hiro came onto the scene just in time to  catch the accident. He saw the girl jump from the bike. He saw the bike  spinning toward the lady with the baby. It was going to hit them. It couldn't  have been more than five centimeters away from the woman's face and then…the  girl screamed "No!" and...for just the slightest of  moments, Hiro could swear the girl flashed a bright green before hitting the  ground jarringly. Hiro was distracted but when he heard the sound of scrap  metal hitting the pavement he looked back. Some how the bike had been blown to  bits, none of the pieces falling near the woman and baby, who looked completely  unharmed.</p><p>Hiro was not new to Nerima. He'd heard  stories from the other cops about the martial artists in the area, but he  hadn't paid much attention. He figured that their warnings didn't pertain to  his area of influence. What good were martial arts when you had to rely on a  machine? Now he wondered…</p><p>Nabiki felt completely drained, and she  seemed to be bathing in pain. When her eyes were open all she could see was  colored dots, so she closed them. She remembered... If Kasumi had not been there  Akane would be dead. Just at the moment when the pressure on the trigger would  have sent a bullet flying through Akane's precious head… Kasumi had said  something completely disarming.</p><p>"I really wish you two would stop fighting  so much," she said.</p><p>In Nabiki's warped state of mind she almost  shot Kasumi instead. Didn't she understand the seriousness of the situation?  She was about to murder her sister! This wasn't just a childish spat!</p><p>Then Nabiki went over what she had just  thought.</p><p>It WAS just a childish spat, and Nabiki was  about to murder her sister because SHE didn't understand the seriousness of the  situation!</p><p>The tears started coming then, tears she  hadn't realized she had been holding. Tears for her mother, but mostly tears for  herself, for losing her innocence, for almost losing so much more.</p><p>An hour or so later, Nabiki was in the  bathroom. Her reflection hovered over the sink. Once again she felt the need to  destroy, to obliterate. But this time the barrel of the gun was in her mouth.  The look that she saw in her eyes, the eyes of her reflection, made her feel  the need even more. It was like a feedback loop of depression and hate. Nabiki  was maybe five seconds away from pulling the trigger when she heard Kasumi's  steps as she entered the open doorway. It was almost funny...she had stopped  putting pressure on the trigger because of a vague thought that Kasumi would  disapprove of the action. The gun was still in her mouth, though, until Kasumi  spoke.</p><p>She had hesitated for a second, and then, in  a voice that seemed full of compassion and understanding…asked if Nabiki wanted  some tea.</p><p>It was out of the blue…completely unexpected.  But suddenly instead of having the inevitability of the barrel of a 9mm, Nabiki  was given a choice between a bullet in the brain and tea.</p><p>Nabiki chose tea.</p><p>No one ever mentioned it. Daddy probably  never even knew about it, and for the most part the whole incident was  forgotten, but it was a wake up call for Nabiki. She sold the gun, ended almost  all of her black market dealings, and vowed to rely solely on her camera from  then on. Nabiki hadn't yet completely enmeshed herself into the criminal  element or she would not have been able to get out at all.  As it was it was close. Way too close...</p><p>Back home, Akane never threatened Nabiki with  violence again, and Nabiki never again mistook Kasumi's overly positive  attitude for air headedness, but other than that things fell into the same  pattern they had before. Nabiki never forgot the look in her eyes that night  though. She still had nightmares from time to time, and those dark feelings, that wish for death...it never completely left  her. It was there, waiting for a moment of weakness. But Nabiki fought it. She  fought it for two years, and while it remained, she had grown stronger.</p><p>Nabiki's last thought before losing  consciousness from fatigue and a rising awareness of pain… was about driving  the Model G. There was only one thing she loved more…her family. And it seemed  Ranma had somehow managed to weasel himself into that group.</p><p>Damn him. Nabiki smiled... and passed out.</p><p>Sitting on the outside porch in his gi, watching the morning sun glint off the koi pond, Genma wondered about his wife.</p><p>He missed her right now. The years of their  time together held many quiet moments like this one, except she was by Genma's  side or maybe in the kitchen cooking, or maybe asleep  a few meters away. Now…now she was separated from him by half an entire city  and all because of a question.</p><p>Was Ranma a man among men?</p><p>Had Genma been thinking, he would have asked  just what Nodoka had meant by that before signing the contract. Genma hadn't  been thinking though. Thinking was never Genma's strong point. Even if he had been doing an awful lot of it recently.</p><p>He knew exactly what "man among men" meant  now.</p><p>It was odd, but Genma couldn't remember why  it was he had agreed to the contract. The story he would tell was that he  needed to get Ranma away from his mother's coddling, but that wasn't it really.  As nice as Nodoka was, she could be very stern, and if anything Ranma would  have been better off if she was around.</p><p>In fact, Genma didn't remember much of his  marriage with Nodoka at all. Just little things, like the  taste of her cooking, and that when he was with her, he was happy.</p><p>He needed her.</p><p>It was time for this charade to end.</p><p>Genma stood up and walked  into the family room through the engawa entrance. He  picked up the receiver to the black telephone and punched the numbers he had  punched at payphones all around Nerima since he had started living with the  Tendos.</p><p>"Hello? Who, may I ask, is calling?" The  woman on the other end asked.</p><p>"It's me." Genma answered.</p><p>"Why Mr. Panda! How good of you to call!"</p><p>Genma smiled in spite of himself. Nodoka  could always make him laugh.</p><p>"What the hell is that?" Ranma asked. Tofu  was wielding some sort of weird gun-like thing and approaching her menacingly.</p><p>"It's for your own good, Ranma," Tofu  smiled. The expression was somewhat strained, though. If Ranma didn't get her  ears pierced she would never leave. Tofu liked Ranma fine, but he wasn't sure  even he could stand Ranma LIVING with him. It was a lucky thing that he  happened to have some ear piercing equipment handy. Now if Ranma would just sit  still…</p><p>"Like hell it is! You get that thing outta my face before I rearrange yours!"<br/>"Please don't make this difficult,  Ranma. This will do a much better job of piercing your ears than anything else.  The equipment is sterile, and there's only a little pain…" Tofu stepped closer  to Ranma. The ear piercing gun poised about half a meter from her ear. His ear. He had changed sexes again.</p><p>"I, Ranma Saotome of the Saotome School of  Anything Goes Martial Arts…accept your challenge." <i>This is great!</i> Ranma thought. <i>I'm  a man again AND I get to fight Tofu!.</i> Ranma knew  Tofu was good…it was time to find out HOW good.</p><p>Tofu noted Ranma's change with clinical  curiosity. It meant several things. Ranma felt most like a man when he was  fighting, for one. This was understandable. What was interesting was that Ranma  did not change until the moment before he accepted Tofu's "challenge."  His feeling of manhood was NOT related to  fighting in and of itself…it was something else…something deeper. Something  perhaps to do with the pride he had of himself and his school, but that wasn't  quite it either… Tofu, lost in thought, almost forgot to block Ranma's kick.</p><p>Ranma quickly reassessed Tofu's abilities. It  looked like he was barely paying attention! He followed up with some high speed  punches and kicks, but Tofu blocked or dodged them all while wearing a placid,  thoughtful expression on his face. How could he BE this good? At this rate,  Ranma would have to move the fight outside or risk damaging the clinic. There  was still one thing he could try though…</p><p>When was Ranma a girl?  Tofu tried to remember when it was Ranma had  changed… He was upset about Akane…He said he ran away…Then he started crying.  It was when he started crying. Yes…but why? It couldn't just be crying that  caused him to change. WHY was he crying? Akane didn't love him. Hmmm… maybe  that's it. After Tofu blocked Ranma's Chestnut Fist, Tofu decided to  experiment…"You know, it's tough, but just because Akane doesn't love you, it's  not the end of the world."</p><p>Ranma collected his jaw from the floor after  having one of his strongest attacks so easily blocked. "You leave Akane outta this!" Ranma forgot for a moment where he was and let  his anger guide him. He threw the fastest Amaguriken he had ever managed while  male. One punch made it through Tofu's defenses. But that was it.</p><p>"Ooof!"  Okay, it wasn't Akane that made Ranma change. And Ranma was extremely talented.  Tofu had been training all his life for twenty six years and Ranma was only 17.  Nine years of extra experience and still the kid managed to get a good hit in.  Tofu decided he wouldn't hold back QUITE so much. The arm of his free hand  seemed to become a solid funnel with indistinct edges as he performed his own  high speed maneuver, hitting Ranma's chest with his two fingers with just  enough force to bruise. Then, simultaneously he lightly front kicked him back  onto the examination table.</p><p>"Ow." Ranma said.</p><p>So what was it that made Ranma change? Maybe feeling weak? That he was somehow afraid of Akane and  that made him change? It was a long shot but Tofu was willing to try it.  "Ranma, you seem to be overreacting a bit. It's just a small hole in your  ears…There's nothing to be scared about."</p><p>"I ain't scared!"  Ranma yelled back...then he relaxed. This was Tofu, and Ranma was not going to  pull an Akane and pretend he could beat him in a fair fight. It would take some  massive training first. Tofu was just trying to help. Maybe if he shared a  little emotional stuff Tofu would show him a few moves "Well…maybe I am scared  a little. Not about the pain. It just seems like everyone's tryin'  ta turn me inta some stinkin' girl…"</p><p>Ranma had remained male through the  confession. Tofu didn't understand. What could possibly be the trigger? Maybe  it was just some sort of strange form of suggestion? Maybe Ranma turned female  when he THOUGHT she was female? Tofu was grasping at straws now, but it was  important to find out now, and not be surprised later. "I…um…just  hit a pressure point that will make you unable to turn male again…after you  change."</p><p>The color went out of Ranma's face. This had  to be one of Tofu's jokes right? That weird sense of humor of  his? He made an attempt at a smile "Heh that was good, doc…almost got me  there…"</p><p>"Um…it's not a joke" Tofu grimaced.  Technically it wasn't a joke. It just wasn't the truth either.</p><p>"ARGHH! Why can't  you people realize that I don't WANT my decisions made for me?"</p><p>Tofu felt real bad, he just thanked the gods  that he HADN'T hit any such pressure point. Ranma hadn't changed form. He had  to end the ruse…</p><p>"Well I had enough of it you hear? ENOUGH!"  Ranma got back into a fighting stance. Tofu had betrayed him.  And while he might not stand a chance in a  fair fight, she was no longer interested in fighting fair. "I'm going to KILL  YOU!"</p><p>Before Tofu knew it, he was looking at the  floor of his bedroom from a unique perspective. He had just enough time to  notice that the insulation could use some refurbishing, when his head was  pulled back through the floor and he was thrown into the wall, "into" being a  highly accurate preposition. It seemed that 9 years of extra experience or no,  the only reason why Ranma was unable to beat Tofu before was that he had been  held in check by the same thing that made him feel like a man…his sense of self  worth, honor, and morality. "Calm down Ranma, I didn't hit any pressure points.  I just had to see what would make you change."</p><p>"You mean you were just playing with me? TOFU NO BAKA!" Ranma hit Tofu over the head with a mallet  she got from…somewhere. Ranma stared at it for a while until it winked out of  existence. Where did it come from? Where did it go?</p><p>"Where did YOU come from, Cotton-eyed Joe?"  Tofu asked the coat rack in a bit of a daze from the repeated blows to the  head. His glasses had left his head somewhere between the wall and the ceiling.</p><p>There was a knocking from the door "Oh my! I  wonder who that could be!" Ranma wondered out loud as she walked to the door.</p><p>"K-K-Kasumi! When  did you get here?"</p><p>"Oh Tofu, you're so silly!" Ranma said, then opened the door.</p><p>A woman looking about thirtyish  and carrying a baby greeted her. "You must be Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma nodded her head slowly. She WAS  Ranma…not big sister Kasumi.</p><p>"I've heard a lot about you…Is Dr. Tofu in?"</p><p>Ranma glanced over at the good doctor doing  the cha cha with the coat rack. "Well, yes and no…  You can talk to him if you want, but he's a little disoriented right now. May I  ask what your name is?"</p><p>"Yamashita Niburi,  please go easy on me. Kasumi-chan isn't here is she?"</p><p>"No, it's nothing like that. Tofu-sensei and  I had a minor altercation, and I'm afraid I went a little too far. Who's the  little one? He's very cute!"</p><p>"You don't sound like the Ranma I've heard  about. He's supposed to be very crude and, so sorry, masculine." Oddly,  Yamashita seemed to hold the baby tighter, but gave no other indication that  she had heard Ranma's comment.</p><p>"Oh, that's just my father's influence. I'm  getting better. I still revert to the old me from time to time though. No matter  what anyone says, I'm really a woman." Ranma ignored the woman's stunned  expression; she was used to it after all. She realized Mrs. Yamashita was still  standing outside "Come inside, I'm sure Tofu-sensei won't mind!"</p><p>Yamashita entered, taking her shoes off at  the genkan. She wondered what her friend would think  about what Ranma had said. That was a thought for a different time though.  "Nabiki-chan will be here shortly, she had an accident. You might be a help  actually."</p><p>"Nabiki-neechan had an accident? That  doesn't sound like her much at all."</p><p>"So sorry, but I don't think you know her as  well as you think, Ranma-chan."</p><p>Hiro watched as the door to the Tofu clinic  opened, admitting the woman and her baby. He wasn't quite sure why he was here.  Tendo Nabiki, that was the lunatic's name, was put on a stretcher and carried  into an ambulance. The woman who almost got hit by the motor scooter, a Mrs.  Yamashita, far from making any complaints, had actually insisted that Nabiki be  taken here for reasons she didn't care to discuss. The paramedics agreed, it  was close by after all and Nabiki's injuries weren't that serious. They were  mainly dispatched as a precaution anyway.</p><p>He looked at his watch. Some twenty minutes  had passed since the actual accident. Most of that was spent waiting for the  ambulance and driving behind it as, even with its emergency lights flashing,  it's bulk wouldn't allow it to drive at even half Nabiki's previous speed, and  because it wasn't an emergency and it was getting close to lunch time, it was  actually amazing it didn't take longer. It would have been quicker to walk!</p><p>Still, Hiro hadn't actually realized that he  was following the ambulance until it had stopped. It was only when the  paramedics brought Nabiki out in the stretcher that he could say what it was he  hoped to accomplish by being here. He wanted to know what the hell he had seen,  and…he still had to give Nabiki a proper arrest. Smiling, he popped a stick of  cinnamon gum into his mouth and followed Nabiki's stretcher into the Tofu  clinic.</p><p>When Ranma saw Nabiki she knew that  Yamashita-san was right. She didn't know Nabiki that well at all. From the look  of her dislocated shoulder and broken arm, she had taken a fall at a pretty  high velocity. And when Ranma checked her aura…she could only see a faint  sparkling here and there. "She's almost completely drained of ki!"</p><p>Yamashita-san nodded. "I brought her over  here as soon as I could. "</p><p>This kind of ki depletion didn't happen unless you used an awful  lot of it. It also meant that, despite appearances, Nabiki could very well die.  Tofu needed to wake up SOON. Ranma hurried over to him. "Tofu-sensei you need  to snap out of it okay? Nabiki-neechan is here and she needs your help."</p><p>Tofu brought himself out of his stupor and  noted his current situation. He didn't have his glasses on but he could see  well enough as long as he didn't need to read or apply any exact pressure  points. Two paramedics were waiting for him patiently around a girl in a  stretcher…Nabiki. Ranma was there still, so she hadn't run off. He saw Mrs.  Yamashita and bowed. "Good morning Yamashita-san how are you today?"</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Good to hear. And how is Mr. Yamashita?"  Tofu asked with a smile indicating the baby.</p><p>"As good as he can be considering he's more  than thirty years younger than he ought to be." Yamashita-san replied tersely.  "So sorry, but Nabiki-chan needs your attention more than I do at the moment."</p><p>Tofu then saw Nabiki. Her ki was almost  completely gone! Tofu hadn't seen a case this severe in years! He'd have to  look in a manual and perform a few precise pressure points…damn. Tofu addressed  the two paramedics that came in with Nabiki. "Either of you know anything about  ki deprivation?"</p><p>"Hmm… is that like when you can't get into your  car?" The one on the left asked earnestly.</p><p>"Nah…I think its  when one of the notes on a piano is missing."</p><p>"Never mind," Tofu said wearily, "You two  might as well go." Tofu saw a police officer come in after they left. "What are  you doing here?"</p><p>"I'm here to arrest her, sir," Hiro said  around the wad of gum in his mouth "I'll just wait until she wakes up if that's  okay."</p><p>"Fine. Whatever. Ranma?"</p><p>"Yes, Tofu-sensei?"</p><p>"Go to my library and find a book titled  'Deforestation of the Japanese Wilderness' Also, see if you can find my  glasses. Hurry."</p><p>Ranma did as Tofu asked. She knew the  seriousness of Nabiki's situation. Luckily all of Tofu's books were ordered by  title and Ranma was able to find the book after only a minute or so of searching.  He pulled it out of the shelf and ran back to where Nabiki lay, stopping  briefly to pick Tofu's glasses off the floor. "Here ya  go, doc. How is she lookin'?"</p><p>Tofu did a quick double take at Ranma's  change back to male form and then quickly put his slightly bent glasses on and  opened the book. "She has a chance now..."</p><p>"Doc, how's that book gonna  help?"</p><p>"Ah... ki...it means 'tree' as well as  spiritual energy. Deforestation, ki deprivation...it's a sort of pun...Okay  here it is!"  Tofu looked over Nabiki  again and grimaced. "She's fading fast... I hope there's still time." He picked  up Nabiki's limp arms and crossed the wrists over a specific spot on her fore  head. It was probably aggravating the broken right arm but it was necessary.</p><p>"Doc... her third eye's a little higher..."</p><p>"Yes, you're right..." Tofu moved Nabiki's  wrists a half centimeter higher. "Ranma...could you hold her wrists like this?  Don't let them move from position. Also...you seem to see the aura  clearer...you're going to have to be my eyes. She's very faint."</p><p>"Uh...sure," and  Ranma did as Tofu asked.</p><p>Tofu gently grasped Nabiki's ankles and,  turning the girl's lower body so that her knees bent to one side, he pressed  them to her rear. Luckily the girl was surprisingly flexible, most likely from  Yoga Tofu surmised. It would explain how she would be able to release so much  ki without showing much skill in the Art. Holding Nabiki's ankles in position  with his right hand he placed his left a little below the navel then he paused.  "Ranma...can you see the center of the prostatic  plexus?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Her water chakra... can you see it?"  Normally Tofu could find its exact location without difficulty, but the aura  was so weak...</p><p>"Um yeah. It's  ...it's just a little lower than where you're at."  Ranma watched the doctor move his hand slowly downward until the palm was right  at the spot. "Yeah that's it right there. You tryin ta make her pee herself or something?" Ranma asked confused  and quite a bit worried.</p><p>"Let me know if her breathing becomes  irregular."</p><p>"Right...sure thing..."Ranma swallowed.</p><p>Tofu focused and sent a measure of ki through  his arm out of his hand and into Nabiki's water chakra. He allowed himself a  grimace as the girl did, in fact, wet herself. It would have happened anyway.  Hopefully though the small amount of ki he gave Nabiki would jumpstart her and  he'd feel her ki flowing back toward him. The arms and legs served to loop the  ki flow back and keep as little of the energy from escaping as possible... Tofu  stopped. It wasn't working.</p><p>"Uh...Doc?"</p><p>"What is it Ranma?"</p><p>"You told me to tell ya  if her breath got irregular?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Well, she kinda  stopped breathing. Is that bad?"</p><p>Tofu's eyes went wide. "Ranma...do you know  CPR?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head.</p><p>"I need to find some way to get her ki back  but she's not going to make it unless..." Tofu was hit by the look on the  martial artist's face. He was pale, his eyes wide and moist with threatening  tears.</p><p>Ranma was afraid.</p><p>Ranma wasn't the only one. Hiro watched  everything with amusement until the pigtailed guy said the Tendo girl wasn't  breathing. He was shocked at first. The girl just had a few broken bones...why  would she stop breathing? The doctor had kept going on about trees and  spiritual energy, and he supposed it had something to do with that blast she  let out...must of over-exerted her or  something...served her right...but he really didn't understand what was going  on.</p><p>Not breathing...needing CPR...THAT he  understood all too well. Watching your father die of a heart attack at the age  of five, while the paramedics took their sweet time getting to him, and not  knowing what to do, feeling so damned USELESS...That did a lot to change a man.  Hiro never made it to med school, but he sure as hell knew CPR now and he  wasn't about to let someone else die. Not on his watch.</p><p>Not thinking a second longer, he rushed to  the doctor's side. "I know CPR. Leave her to me." The doctor nodded and Hiro  checked the Tendo girl's pulse...it wasn't there. He shook her once just to be  sure, but there was no response. He felt along the ribcage and used his fingers  to find the right place to press. Taking a breath, he took off his sunglasses,  put them in his breast pocket, swallowed his gum, and started resuscitating.</p><p>Tofu gritted his teeth as he tried once again  to jumpstart Nabiki's ki production. This wasn't good. If the CPR didn't make  Nabiki start breathing again her ki wouldn't be able to regenerate itself...</p><p>"Doc, what do we do now?" Ranma asked over  Nabiki's head.</p><p>"I don't know Ranma. This is the most  serious case I've seen...the only other way that Nabiki can be revived is  through a full ki transfusion and that's impossible..."</p><p>"What do you mean it's impossible?"</p><p>"The only documented case of a ki  transfusion ever working was between two identical twins. The ki has to be very  similar or else the body rejects it. The technique I use only uses a little ki  and even that would fail completely if the ki's paths  weren't blocked. To attempt a full transfusion...not only would it probably  fail, there's a good chance the donor would die... as well as anyone else in  the room."</p><p>Ranma looked down for a moment before he  brightened... "Doc...a part of me is just like Nabiki ain't it? What if I change over to her, then the  transfusion thingie should work right?"</p><p>Tofu frowned " Hmm...maybe...but you don't have Nabiki's personality, you only  have your <i>interpretation</i> of Nabiki's  personality...and we've already determined there's quite a lot that we don't  know about her."</p><p>"We gotta try  right?" Ranma countered. Ranma concentrated for a moment, sweat pouring down  his brow. He frowned. "DAMMIT! I can't change into her! Its gotta be on accident or something!" And then his  eyes met Tofu's. "Doc...you ever think that maybe life  is just a little TOO convenient?"</p><p>Tofu just gave Ranma a look of  incomprehension as the pigtailed boy ran to the counter by the other patient  bed. Ranma picked up the earrings. The Saiserefu  Noon. The artifact of Thyself Known.</p><p>Ranma touched the end of the hook of on of  the earrings with his forefinger, drawing blood. "Aw crap. This is really gonna hurt." Closing his eyes, he pulled out the lobe of  his right ear and stabbed it with an earring.</p><p>It did hurt. And after the initial pain came  a pins and needles sensation that spread throughout Ranma's body. He felt  another pain in his left earlobe and another wave of pins and needles and,  feeling with his left hand, he confirmed that the other earring had gone in quite  on its own. Like a rush of wind, voices started a ruckus in his head. He  recognized some...his father, Ukyo, Ryoga, Akane, others he didn't understand,  others he knew all too well. It was almost too much. He would have passed out  from the mere effort of making sense of it all, but he had a purpose. He  focused. "I need to be Nabiki...Tendo Nabiki. I...Tendo Nabiki...I...need  to...I...Nabiki...I...am...I am Tendo Nabiki!"</p><p>Tendo Nabiki was very confused.</p><p>"I thought you said all the phones were  tapped?" Nodoka said on the other end.</p><p>"They are, No-chan, but I think Nabiki  already knows you know about me… I wish I could tell you where Ranma is…"</p><p>"NO! There's still a chance. We can't lose  hope!"</p><p>"Nodoka…It's been more than a decade! And  Ra-Ranko…she's hurting. And she's changing No-chan,  and I don't like what she's changing into. She needs a mother. Not an aunt."</p><p>"Genma…if I…adopt her, then she's going to  know I know about you. Do you realize how that will make her feel?"</p><p>"Betrayed, used…I know it will be hard, but  I've gone through it before. It has to be better than this. Besides maybe this  is just the push he…she needs."</p><p>"You know we can't talk like that, Genma, it  might break the contract!"</p><p>Genma was silent for a long time before  responding. "I'm…beginning to think we should just forget about the contract."</p><p>Genma couldn't even hear Nodoka breathe in  the pause before she spoke. "Genma…I understand how you feel, and I haven't  seen what you've seen, so I'll forgive you just this once, but you even MENTION  that possibility again…I love you Genny-kun…please…  don't make me hate you."</p><p>"No-chan I…I love you too. Please consider  it… Ran…ko can't take more  of this. I can't take much more of this."</p><p>"Genma…" There were tears in Nodoka's voice.  In twenty-two years of marriage that was the first time Genma had ever said  that he loved her. "I'll come…tomorrow. I'll stay for the weekend. You have to  be the one to tell her though."</p><p>"Alright. I hope…we  can be a family again soon."</p><p>"I hope so too, Genma. Until then,"</p><p>"Until then." Genma  hung up. He hated this. He hated doing this to his child. But it was something  that had to be done. Just like the Nekoken, just like Jusenkyo. By the end of  this weekend, Ranma would have to make a choice. Boy or girl, honor or love...</p><p>Death or life.</p><p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~</p><p>AN: The next  chapter was originally going to be part of this one, but I generally like to  keep my chapters close to twenty pages long and was going way past that limit.  Anyway if it seems a little incomplete that's why.</p><p>Nabiki driving a  motorcycle may be a little OOC but I just couldn't get the idea out of my head.  It sprang from wondering why you never see any scenes in the anime of Nabiki  walking to school and why she is so insistent on not walking with Ranma and  Akane in the first episode. And of course Nabiki does have a "helmet"  hairstyle...</p><p>Thanks go to  Nemesis Zero, Aondehafka, and Figment for their  helpful comments.</p><p>Any mistakes are  mine alone.</p><p>Feedback greatly  appreciated.</p>
