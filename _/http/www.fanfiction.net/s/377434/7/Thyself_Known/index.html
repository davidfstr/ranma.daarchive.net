</div>Thyself Known  Ch.7: I, Ranma  By Zorknot<p><b>Disclaimer</b>: Ranma1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi and  her cohorts.</p><p><b>What Has Come Before:</b> Ranma and Nabiki's mind meld  caused them to exchange weaknesses as well as  strengths, as evidenced by the fact that they were  recently featured on the six o'clock news, screwing  each other's brains out and making wild cat noises.  Now they are both in prison for exposing themselves,  but its been a day and they haven't been let out yet.  Turns out Detective Inamura has some questions to ask  regarding the death of a friend of Nabiki's, Tomo  Hoko.</p><p>Ch.7</p><p><i>"Has he lost his mind?  Can he see or is he blind?  Can he walk at all,  Or if he moves will he fall?  Is he alive or dead?  Has he thoughts within his head?  We'll just pass him there  why should we even care"</i><br/>-Black Sabbath</p><p>dream</p><p>Ranma is a cat. A leopard or panther or something  equally fierce. He paces back and forth behind the  bars of his cage as people pass by. His mate, Nabiki  is watching with a bored expression. She begins to  lick herself. Shampoo, the other female is in the  other corner of the cage. She will not attempt to  mate again for some time.</p><p>There is a noise. The door to the cage is opening.  There in the entryway stands a human female. She  laughs covering her mouth with the back of her hand  "OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!"</p><p>She flings out a ribbon. It wraps around Shampoo's  throat. "This one will look good on my wall!" She  pulls and the head comes off.</p><p>Ranma lunges at the girl but a smaller cage comes  down around him from the ceiling and he bangs against  the bars brutally but to no avail. "You're mine,  Ranma-sama," the girl says. "Mine and no one else's"</p><p>"No one's" She wraps her ribbon around Nabiki's  throat. She laughs.</p><p>reality</p><p>Ranma woke up in a cold sweat. He had that feeling  again that his dream meant something. That it  foretold the future somehow. It was different this  time, but most of it was the same. Kodachi killing  someone he loved, and him powerless to stop it.</p><p>Someone he loved. He had loved Akane, he still did a  little, but now, he was madly in love with Nabiki.</p><p>I'm such a hypocrite, Ranma thought as he lay on the  top bunk of his prison cell, staring at the dim  fluorescent light of the ceiling. Until yesterday, he  hadn't had any feelings at all for Nabiki, and  now...He wanted to spend the rest of his life with  her. He had spent a year saying that he didn't want a  fiancée...that he wasn't ready. But after she  intercepted him yesterday in that intersection, and  kept him from going after Shampoo... He wanted to  marry her right now, ready or not.</p><p>It wasn't just the sex, though that had been awesome;  it was...well, she was literally a part of him, and  he of her, but that didn't describe it well enough  somehow. At any rate, he was now sure that at least  two parts of the legion of personalities he carried  with him were in love with Nabiki: the Nekoken and  his "base" personality, the one he seemed to come  back to all the time.</p><p>Ranma sat up and gazed at the white metal bars of his  cell. They had kept him here an awfully long time.  The guy with the sunglasses said it would only be for  a few hours, but that was yesterday afternoon. Ranma  really didn't mind too much. He kind of enjoyed the  peace and quiet, and had used the time for training  and meditation.</p><p>He stretched his legs idly on the bunk. He was  wearing gray prison clothes now, as his Chinese shirt  and pants weren't functional as clothing when he was  arrested. The material was kind of scratchy and stiff.  Okay for now, but he would be changing back into his  silk Chinese outfit as soon as possible.</p><p>It was strange, though... He would have thought that  a prison would be noisier. And weren't they supposed  to serve food? Ranma's stomach growled in agreement.  Still, Ranma had been in far worse places than this.   It was wondering what had happened to Nabiki that  really made him want out of here.</p><p>Looking at the bars and remembering the level of  security in the hallways, he had already come up with  seven different ways of escaping, two of which would  only take some five minutes, and one of which could  be accomplished without much effort at all, and that  wouldn't even really be illegal.</p><p>Nodding to himself, Ranma decided to go for this last  one. He closed his eyes and thought of buying ice  cream, of beating up Happosai, of cooking, of...  being pretty. He thought of little things...the way  people looked at her, the way people did things for  her...the way she could do things for other  people...if only they weren't so violent...</p><p>Ranma felt her body change from male to female as she  thought of feminine things…</p><p>She went a little too far.</p><p>"Oh dear!" Ranma exclaimed out loud as she was filled  with revulsion at the memories she now had. "Nabiki's  just a good friend! I would never..." But she did, or  rather he did.</p><p>It helped to make the distinction. That crass boy was  not her. If it hadn't been for Genma, none of that  would have happened.</p><p>Ranma blushed a little, realizing that she couldn't  bring herself to regret the memory, and now all of a  sudden she felt like thanking her father. She shook  her head. She was not a lesbian. It was a valuable  experience, and she would be able to use it when it  came time for her to please her husband maybe, but  she wanted a family with children and neighbors and  afternoon tea, just like when she was young and she  and Akane would play in the yard, and Mom and Dad  were still together...</p><p>She'd never have that if she were a lesbian. Besides,  there were plenty of handsome men around. Ranma  wondered idly if she'd be able to tear their clothes  off with as much vigor as Nabiki had shown with her  male counterpart... She blushed a little deeper at  that.</p><p>It was really a revelation to her though...apparently  some men were actually attracted to strong women. She  had thought for so long that a woman had to be quiet  and submissive in order to attract a man. "Maybe I  should be more like Nabiki," Ranma considered aloud.  In truth, she was a little jealous of Nabiki, so  powerful and yet so undeniably feminine...</p><p>What was she doing? Ranma wanted to know. She was  suddenly worried. What if something happened to her?</p><p>"I gotta get out of here." Ranma murmured to herself  and stopped her line of thought as she noticed the  changeover of her personalities from uber femme hit  on the head Ranma to normal everyday female Ranma.</p><p>"Woah. I don't know if I'm ever going to get used to  that...kind of hope I don't really..."</p><p>She jumped off the bunk, her bare feet landing on the  cold concrete. Shoes were always a problem. The  moment someone invented truly adjustable footwear,  Ranma planned on buying it in bulk. Again she stopped  herself. She would only need to do that if she  planned on keeping her girl form. Do I really want to  get rid of the curse? she asked herself, as she had  in the past. And now it seemed stupid. It wasn't even  a curse really anymore. The only reason she was a  girl at all was so she could see Nabiki again.</p><p>Ranma reflected on recent events while she rolled up  the sleeves of her prison shirt and made cuffs in her  pants. Really, ever since she did that mind merge  with Nabiki things had been going so much better. She  hadn't even had to use those earrings...</p><p>The earrings that were now somewhere in the streets  of Nerima, getting run over by countless vehicles and  pedestrians...</p><p>Ranma slapped her forehead chuckling, "Dammit why  didn't I think of that when I was having hot sex in  the middle of the city?" She wasn't really concerned.  Still, she'd ask Tofu about it when she got out.  First things first...</p><p>"Excuse me… Mr. Warden sir?" she called out sweetly  to the somewhat gaunt looking man in uniform down the  hall.</p><p>The hall, Ranma realized with a start, seemed quite a  bit longer than she remembered. Idly looking up, she  couldn't find the ceiling. Just pale green,  flickering fluorescent lights that seemed to float  above the floor. She blinked, shook her head and  tried to look again, but there was no change.  Probably just a weird optical illusion, Ranma told  herself, not quite believing it.</p><p>The warden sauntered lazily toward Ranma's cell. He  had a strange gait, keeping his left leg completely  straight and swinging it around his other foot to  progress a step. His face reminded Ranma of Gosunkugi,  only with a rakish, toothless grin added to the  already sickening countenance. "What can I help you  with?" he asked with a good helping of sarcasm.</p><p>This was giving Ranma the creeps but she stuck to her  plan, "As you can see, there's been some kind of  mistake. This is a prison for guys, and I'm a girl.  Could you please let me out?"</p><p>The warden smiled. "So...you're a girl now, are you,  Ranma? That's nice. I wonder what your pussy tastes  like?"</p><p>"Excuse me?" Ranma backed away. This guy knew her?  And apparently he had a perversion that didn't just  end with inanimate objects. "Who are you?"</p><p>The warden laughed and it sounded like the engine of  an antiquated diesel trying to start. Then he shove a  spindly arm through the bars of the cell snatching at  Ranma, "I feel you. Feel you come undone. Like a  present. Like string. You flow. Flow into different  molds, different worlds You burn white hot liquid  fire!"</p><p>Ranma backed farther away, her back touching the bowl  of the sink behind her. She wished she could use the  Tobu Sennuki she came up with yesterday on the creep  but she didn't have the soul of ice going, and after  what it did to Happosai, what if it killed the guy?   She looked around for things she could use to attack  the man through the bars. She swallowed and tried to  calm herself. It was just an old guy with a limp. She  could take him no problem...but he gave her the  creeps. "Listen, man, I don't know what your problem  is. I just...I haven't had my phone call yet. Can I  get my phone call?"</p><p>"No phones in Hell! No phones in Hell!" he screeched.  Then he grabbed the bars with his hands and laughed  his carburetor laugh. "I've been here so long waiting  for a way out. Waiting for you! And here you are all  wrapped in a pretty package. I am the master of this  space. I am...Iron man."</p><p>Ranma guffawed before she could stop herself. "Iron  man? What kind of name is that? You play too many  videogames or something?"</p><p>The bars that the warden held started to glow. Ranma  felt intense heat wash over her, and she had to  shield her eyes against the light. Suddenly she felt  a terrible pain in her gut, a pain that increased  exponentially as she felt herself lifted up and  pinned to the glass of the mirror above the sink. She  smelled something burning. Flesh. Cloth. Her eyes  adjusted to the brightness enough to see the cackling  face of the warden, his arm now ending in long sharp  spear that impaled her stomach.</p><p>Smoke curled around her head and the weight of her  body pushed her down, the hot metal cutting up her  torso like butter melting on a knife. She couldn't  scream, it was too painful. Too much. She saw spots  in her vision...the room grew darker.</p><p>"That's it, pretty one. Pass out. Let me inside that  body of yours. Let me escape into the world of  men..."</p><p>Ranma snapped her eyes open. If she passed out this  bastard would kill her. She was probably dead anyway  but...she had to keep going... if only just to see  Nabiki one last time. "Nabiki..." Ranma wheezed out,  a wisp of smoke coming out of her mouth.</p><p>Nabiki was startled into a standing position out of  her chair in the interrogation room, jingling the  links of her handcuffs.</p><p>"Sit back down, Tendo. You aren't leaving here until  I get some answers," Detective Inamura ordered. His  eyes burned with a fire Nabiki had never seen before  in the man's eyes. His aura, Nabiki noted, was a deep  purple. It darkened and brightened in flashes, like a  bladed weapon wielded in the light.</p><p>One of Nabiki's closest contacts was Inamura's  daughter Yuki, and so Nabiki had met the man a few  times before. He had seemed positively silly then,  although he had a rather macabre sense of humor. Now  though...She almost sat down again without thinking,  compelled by the intense glare of the goateed man's  eyes.</p><p>It was however Nabiki's custom to resist another's  strength when she encountered it, and remained  standing, defiantly. "Ranma...where is he?"</p><p>"I told you already, he ran off. He wasn't in his  cell this morning and he hasn't contacted your family.  Now please, Tendo, sit and explain to me again how it  is that your fingerprints are all over what's left of  Tomo Hoko."</p><p>Nabiki gritted her teeth and sat. "Detective, you  know I wouldn't hurt Hoko. We've been to your house.  Your daughter is a friend of mine and so was Hoko.  Ranma isn't the kind of person who would run away  from something like this. I've got to see him. You  can tail me if you want, but I have to get out of  here or..."</p><p>"You aren't leaving this room, Tendo. I know you  didn't do it. But you know something you're not  telling me, and that makes me wonder."</p><p>Nabiki had known as soon as she had seen Hoko at  Tofu's that something had gone terribly wrong. Hoko's  aura had been normal on the surface, but underneath  it...almost imperceptible was this terrible  flickering blackness. Nabiki thought at first that  maybe Hoko was having problems at home or that maybe  her sickness earlier that morning was some kind of  curse, and if it hadn't been for Shampoo showing up  and chasing after Ranma she might have looked into it.  But now, after Detective Inamura showed her the  gruesome pictures of Hoko's body parts, she knew  exactly what happened.</p><p>It was then that Nabiki first found that Ranma was  missing. She had wanted to talk with him about it,  wanted to see what he would say, needed to really.  But he had apparently escaped his cell and was no  where to be found. It just didn't make sense...</p><p>Something had killed Hoko and was now pretending to  be her. Nabiki wanted to grieve. She wanted to cry,  but it was too much to take in. The cold darkness  overtook her. It was worse than ever. She didn't just  want death, she wanted to crush throats, to expose  entrails, to tear apart bones and suck the marrow.  She bit her hand, trying to stop having the images  parade through her head.</p><p>Her teeth drew blood before she could regain  composure. So ironic. Thinking of death used to give  her composure...</p><p>She came to some rather unpleasant conclusions as she  gathered her thoughts in the restroom of the police  station. First, by announcing that Hoko was dead, the  police had probably lost their best chance of finding  the killer. The bastard would surely change bodies  and then there'd be no way of knowing who he, she or  it would show up as.</p><p>Second, Nabiki would have to be extremely careful  what information she gave to the police. The killer  could be one of them, and if she revealed that she  could detect who it was, then it would only be a  matter of time before she was the next victim.</p><p>The police would not be able to solve this. It was up  to her.</p><p>Which brought her to her present predicament. She was  holding back something. And while she had an  excellent poker face, there was no getting past  Detective Inamura.</p><p>Normally she'd suffer through the interrogation, and  manage to provide an alibi and a viable reason for  her apparent lack of cooperation, but now she had a  terrible feeling...a certainty really. Ranma was in  danger. Ranma was dying.</p><p>Even though she knew the fastest way out of the room  was to calm down and give the detective some  semblance of what he wanted, she couldn't do that now.  She was thinking through desperate escape  plans...maybe she could throw a chair through the  silvered observation window on the wall, jump  through...</p><p>An officer came in with a cup of coffee. It was  officer 542, Kawagami Hiro. The man who had helped  save her life.</p><p>She still couldn't quite get over that one. She had  died, and any doubt about that fact was countered by  bright patterns of energy she could now see around  every living thing around her. Kawagami's eyes were  blue, she noticed. His sunglasses were in his breast  pocket of his white uniform shirt. There was nothing  abnormal about the aura at first, but Nabiki looked  closer...and there it was.</p><p>A dark flickering, behind the visible pattern.</p><p>Inamura accepted the coffee with a grumbled out  "thanks," took a sip without letting it cool at all,  and set it down on the table.</p><p>"Is there anything else I can help with?" Kawagami  asked.</p><p>"Just let me know if anything new turns up in the  investigation," Inamura said gruffly.</p><p>"Of course. Sorry to disturb you," the blue-eyed man  smiled and turned to leave.</p><p>After Kawagami shut the door, Inamura's brow furrowed  as he noted Nabiki's expression. "You look like  you've seen a ghost, Tendo. What's wrong with you?"</p><p>Nabiki got a hold of herself. She was finding it  harder to keep her emotions from showing since the  mind meld with Ranma. She really wasn't sure if that  was really a bad thing or not, but she couldn't  afford to be read so easily in these circumstances.  "I need to make my phone call," she said. "Now."</p><p>Inamura nodded slowly. "I suppose that'd be a good  idea."</p><p>The real Kawagami Hiro was, of course, tied up in  Hoko's closet, catatonic from the sleeping pills  Copycat had found in Tomo-san's medicine cabinet, and  would stay that way until he was sure that Nabiki was  in jail and hopefully Ranma along with her as an  accomplice. He chuckled as he returned to his desk in  the precinct and organized some papers to make it  look like he was working. Soon it would be a simple  matter of taking a prisoner's body and organizing a  trap for the hapless pigtailed boy and then he'd  finally have his vengeance.</p><p>And then what? Once he's dead...what will I do?</p><p>Copycat shook his head free of the thought. Killing  Ranma was all that mattered. After that, he'd be free.</p><p>This was the first time he had ever incapacitated a  real police officer for a disguise. He did it in  desperation when he saw the cop come to the door of  the Tomo residence yesterday. He surmised immediately  why the cop was there and as soon as Copycat, in the  guise of Hoko Tomo, opened the door and the cop  entered the house, he struck a pressure point at the  base of the cop's skull and the man collapsed  predictably to the floor.</p><p>Force feeding him sleeping pills while he was  unconscious was more difficult, but Copycat wasn't  the squeamish sort and so he had just opened Hiro's  mouth and used his finger to shove them down the  throat. Tomo-san was in the backyard attending her  flowers while Copycat dragged the tall muscular body  into Hoko's room and shoved him into the closet. Then,  after telling Tomo-san that he was going to go see  Nabiki and might be staying over, he took a picture  of Hiro with his cursed camera to get his personality  and appearance down, tied him, gagged him, used the  blanket to change into him and left.</p><p>Now Copycat wondered why he hadn't taken over a cop's  life before. He was learning so much about police  procedure. He had made so many stupid mistakes; he  would have never made it without the cursed blanket.  But he was still in a dangerous situation until he  was sure the search for Hoko's killer was over. Sure  he could escape if he absolutely had to, but then  he'd have to find another way to get close to Ranma  and that could take months, and they might be  watching for him.</p><p>He was a little worried about Tomo-san finding the  cop. It'd been a day now, and while Copycat had  checked on him in his Hoko disguise, a lot of things  could have happened while he was away.</p><p>Copycat actually jumped when the phone on Hiro's desk  rang. He smiled at his own nervousness. It had been a  long time since he was this excited. He was so close!  But he had to be careful.</p><p>On the third ring he picked up the receiver. "Nerima  Prefecture Police Station. Officer Kawagami  speaking."</p><p>The voice on the other end was strong, clear, and yet  unmistakably feminine. It was Tendo Nabiki. "What do  you want?" she asked. It seemed emotionless... almost  robotic, but Copycat fancied he heard a trace of  desperation all the same.</p><p>After a pause he answered, "I want what every cop  wants, lady. Justice" Copycat smiled. He should have  been upset that Nabiki found him out, but for some  reason he was actually glad.</p><p>"Justice? Against whom? For what?" Copycat closed his  eyes, imagining Nabiki's face as she asked the  questions...so calm...so composed. If he could see  her, would there be the slightest twitch of an  eyebrow? A small disgusted sneer to the lips? Or  would she just show her anger in her fierce burnt  sienna eyes? Those pools of emotion that even her  great control could never quite hide.</p><p>"He's gotten you too now hasn't he? All this time  you've stood back, amused at all the girls who threw  themselves at him, and now you're just another  flunkie, no different from your homicidal sister, or  the airheaded Amazon, or that pathetic codependent  crossdressing caterer."</p><p>"This is about Ranma," Nabiki said simply.</p><p>"Yes, I gather you know the perpetrator then? The  identity thief? The soul stealer?"</p><p>"That sounds more like your department." There was a  definite tone of acidity in her response.</p><p>"Hoko knew exactly who she was when she died. When  you killed her. You know what she said when she  looked up from her stabbed stomach and saw your face  looking down at her?" Copycat was speaking in hushed  tones now, his voice barely above a murmur, "She said  she understood. She understood, Tendo. Will you be  able to say that if you died right now?"</p><p>"You want to kill Ranma."</p><p>"Don't you? You used to be so sure of yourself. Now  you don't even know what you want anymore, do you?"</p><p>"You won't be able to kill him in prison. He'll just  escape and leave the country, and then you won't be  able to get near him."</p><p>Copycat winced. She was right.- Hadn't he already  done just that? In a day no less. "True, that is a  setback, but I'll find a way."</p><p>"I can help you. I can give you the chance you need  to kill him."</p><p>"What?" he almost yelled out the question.</p><p>"You heard me. I just want a few things in return..."</p><p>"No. You can't fool me, Tendo. You love him. This is  some sort of trick."</p><p>"No trick. I can supply all the resources you need  and can get you closer to him than anyone else. Of  course I can't do that if I'm in prison."</p><p>"What is your proposal?"</p><p>"The police are looking for Hoko's killer. Right now  all the signs point to me and I'll likely be stuck in  jail at least until there can be a trial. But Hoko  isn't necessarily dead, is she? If she were to show  up, then the arm and torso would have to be an  elaborate fake. The police would spin their wheels  for a little while trying to find out what happened,  but in that time you could have your chance with  Ranma."</p><p>Copycat forced himself to be cautious. "How can I be  sure you won't just point me out as the killer as  soon as I show up as Hoko?"</p><p>"You could always say the dead Hoko was trying to  kill YOU. Tofu will confirm that you are the real  thing and at that point no one would believe me even  if I did say something."</p><p>"This chance...you'll let me have any means at your  disposal? You won't obstruct me in any way?"</p><p>"Not at all. You have my word."</p><p>"And the moment I get the slightest idea that your  word is worthless, that is the moment you die. You  understand that, right?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Copycat stood up behind Kawagami's desk with the  receiver to his ear, not bothering to hide the wide  grin that plastered his face. "Then, Tendo, I believe  we have a deal."</p><p>Nabiki put the receiver of the pay phone back onto  its cradle and shuddered. She was not the religious  sort, still she prayed to the gods that she was doing  the right thing. All she knew was that Ranma was in  trouble NOW...that she had to get to him NOW and that  an unsure danger later was at best a secondary  concern. Not only that, but this way she would know  exactly who the doppelganger was. Still, she had just  agreed to become pals with Hoko's killer, and while  there was something to be said for keeping enemies  close, this seemed to be taking it a bit too far.</p><p>Was there any other option? Maybe. But she couldn't  see it now. Every other thought was a voice screaming  at her to move, to run. She had to struggle not to  knock down the officer that watched her and make a  break for it, even knowing that unless she had the  power to bend metal and burst through concrete, which  she didn't, she wouldn't get far before they managed  to detain her. It was so frustrating knowing so many  of Ranma's moves, but lacking the strength and poise  to make them effective.</p><p>The conversation on the phone had exhausted her, but  still her heart raced. Hardly realizing she had  entered again, Nabiki found herself in the  interrogation room once more.</p><p>Inamura's dark brow furrowed. "I've never seen you  this nervous, Tendo. I've never seen you nervous at  all. What's bothering you?"</p><p>"I need to see Ranma. He's in trouble," Nabiki said  without thinking. It was only then that it occurred  to her that it was odd that she would be able to know  that. And that made her wonder just how it was she  expected to help him.</p><p>"Do you think the killer might be after him? Is that  it?"</p><p>"Yes. No..." Nabiki mind needed to rest, to  recuperate from that conversation, "it's a long  story."</p><p>"Why don't you tell it to me, Tendo. Is your lawyer  coming?"</p><p>"Something like that. Ranma's in trouble, Detective.  Isn't there any way you can let me out?"</p><p>"I'm afraid not, Tendo. But if you tell us where he  is we'll be happy to..."</p><p>"You can't do anything! He hasn't left his cell. He's  still there, only...Detective, believe me, I respect  your profession, but there are things in this world  that are completely beyond your jurisdiction and this  is one of them."</p><p>Inamura leaned back in his chair. "So," he pulled out  a cigarette from his pack and lit it. He took a puff  and blew the smoke out of his nostrils before turning  his head once more to Nabiki. "You're saying that  Ranma is trapped in some sort of alternate reality  and that you're the only one that can save him."</p><p>Nabiki squelched her urge to reach across the table  and strangle the goateed man. She looked into his  eyes stonily and said, "Yes. That is exactly what I'm  saying."</p><p>Inamura studied Nabiki's expression for a good minute  and took another pull off his cigarette. He held it  with all four fingers and his thumb as if it were a  joint. He looked up at the fluorescent light and blew  out the smoke. He lowered his gaze to Nabiki again.  "And Hoko Tomo?"</p><p>"Killed by a doppelganger that's going to come into  the police station in an hour or so looking exactly  like her."</p><p>"So in other words, the reason your fingerprints are  on Hoko's arm is that this...doppleganger...was using  a perfect copy of your body while disposing of her?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Another pull off the cigarette, and Inamura asked,  "You're aware of how inane this is right?"</p><p>"Regardless, it is the truth."</p><p>Inamura stubbed the cigarette directly on the table,  since there was no ashtray. "How old do you think I  am, Tendo?"</p><p>"I mean you no disrespect, Detective I'm only..."</p><p>"How old?" Inamura interrupted Nabiki.</p><p>"You're at least as old as my father. I don't see..."</p><p>"I'm fifty-seven years old, Tendo. And guess where  I've been living all this time."</p><p>Nabiki just remained silent.</p><p>"Nerima, born and raised. And yet you, a seventeen-<br/>year-old slip of a girl think that you know more  about what's going on than I do."</p><p>"You knew?"</p><p>"In the real world, people don't hit their heads and  forget all about police procedure. And Kawagami would  never be in here without his sunglasses on. His eyes  are sensitive to the light. Calling him was very  dangerous, and now things aren't going to go as  easy."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Well, of course we had your conversation tapped. I  have to say, Tendo that was pretty stupid what you  did. Extremely dangerous, lying outright to someone  like that. You could get killed. Of course we'll be  watching now, but still. You're walking a thin line.  A real thin line."</p><p>"Wait a minute. You're saying you knew it was a  doppelganger all a long?"</p><p>"The M.O. matched that of another body part found  about a year ago. A Tanaka Buntaro. If we went on  fingerprints or DNA we'd have had to conclude it was  a suicide, but even if the kid was talented enough to  manage sawing his own arms and legs off, the wounds  were post mortem; so either Buntaro had an evil twin  that his mother didn't know about, or there was some  kind of doppelganger loose. We had a similar incident  back in '75 when Dark Sombrero the Mexican mad  scientist created an android that could duplicate  human forms. Thankfully we found some pop idols and  dressed them in sexy robot suits and were able to  stop the problem."</p><p>"Why are you joking around! Ranma's in danger!"</p><p>Inamura shrugged "You have nothing to worry about.  The only transdimensional demon we have here is  Airanman and someone has to have a serious mental  disorder in order for him to be any threat."</p><p>Stifling her throttle reflex, Nabiki said, "Ranma is  going through something called the Ijuu. He isn't the  same person from one minute to the next. Does that  count as a serious mental disorder?"</p><p>"Crap." Inamura hurried behind Nabiki and unlocked  her cuffs. They fell off her wrists and rattled to  the floor. Then he unholstered his pistol, cocked it  and pointed the barrel to the ceiling. "We don't have  much time."</p><p>Inamura explained as he and Nabiki hurried through  the corridors of the police station. "The precinct  exists in a quantum irregularity. Time gets distorted  more and more as you approach the jail and often we  get dimensional crossover. It can get pretty nasty,  but if we take the right path I can get you to Ranma  before whatever's happening starts to happen."</p><p>"Don't you have any larger weapons?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Just 'ole reliable here." Inamura waved his pistol,  but Nabiki's growing sense of imminent doom made it  seem terribly inadequate. "Won't need anything else.  The only way to beat Airanman is through force of  will. Don't think there's a weapon around that'll  dent that guy."</p><p>"Then what's the gun for?"</p><p>"For your boyfriend, in case Airanman takes control  of him."</p><p>"You can't shoot him! He didn't do anything!"</p><p>"Look, Tendo, I'll try to help out if I can, but I  suggest you think of some pretty words to say to your  fiancé, cause this might be the last time you see him  alive."</p><p>The pain wouldn't stop. It grew. It seemed to be  trying to cover Ranma's entire body. Something else  was happening too...something was telling Ranma who  she was. She wanted to fight back to stop the pain  but...</p><p>You don't want it to stop. You like pain. You like  the hot searing fleshiness of it. You're a girl. A  little whore. Your name is Airanko. You like it when  people hit you. You like it when people hurt you. The  more they hurt you the more they love you. See how  much I'm hurting you. You're my little bitch. My  painsickle. My vessel...</p><p>"No..." Ranma tried, "Nabiki..." the pain subsided  somewhat, but that was worse. Ranma wanted it. It  made her feel complete...the pain...</p><p>What you had with Nabiki wasn't real. It was a wet  dream nothing more. You cannot expect Nabiki to drop  everything to marry you. What have you to offer her?  Martial Arts? Please. She's destined for greatness  while you're destined for street fights. You'll have  your fling maybe. She'll use you for a while and then  you'll be discarded. Just like your mother discarded  you. Just like your father discarded you. Just like  Akane...</p><p>She felt the pain growing, filling her, flowing  around her.</p><p>I'm going to surround you. I'm going to make you  impenetrable.. You'll never feel the torture of love  again. You'll have me, my little death doll, forever,  and you will never need anyone else again.</p><p>"Yes..." Airanko whispered and she felt the liquid  metal encompass her as it started to cool. The pain  was positively sweet now. And it would all be over  soon.</p><p>"No!" A clear alto voice rang out. It was familiar to  Airanko but... Oh no! The pain! The pain was leaving!</p><p>"Go away! Go away whoever you are!" she screamed. She  wanted the pain back. The beautiful pain that made  her numb...</p><p>"Ranma, it's Nabiki."</p><p>"My name's not Ranma, it's Airanko!"</p><p>"No. You are Saotome Ranma. You are the heir to the  Anything Goes School of Martial Arts. You saved my  life and now you're my fiancé...the one I love. I  name you. I claim you. You're mine, Saotome, and I'm  not letting you go. So hurry up and kick this guy's  ass."</p><p>A flash. Airanko felt the metal recede further. "No!  He gives me pain. I need pain. Must have pain. I feel  so numb...so numb."</p><p>"Ranma...if it's pain you're looking for, wait till  we're married. I'll make you're life a living hell."</p><p>"Promise?" Airanko asked.</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>See? She can't give you what you need. Only I can.  She'll throw you away like scrap. I will mold you  into something new and shiny and sharp. You'll have  more pain than all your little friends could ever  give. You'll be immortal, my little injury queen, and  your screams will make the earth melt and the heavens  burn away.</p><p>Nabiki's voice came through again though. It was dark  and cold. "Ranma, what the fuck does that thing know  about pain?"</p><p>Airanko frowned. The pain was ebbing, and this was a  new exquisite pain. Airanman didn't seem to  understand. He was trying to get her to take him back  in but he didn't understand. Nabiki...Nabiki could  take everything Airanman told her and multiply it by  ten. Getting hurt by Nabiki would be worse than any  burn, any fracture, any laceration. Because it would  be from her.</p><p>Ranma shook her head free of the smoke. She grimaced.  "Get the fuck off of me, you creep!" she yelled.</p><p>And confronted with the force of Ranma's new-found  will Airanman nearly did exactly that. But he rallied  forth one last ditch effort and lunged, screaming  like metal across metal, "NOOOO!"</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened as she felt the searing hot  liquid metal pass once again into her stomach... felt  it somehow against her back. "I am not your BITCH!"  Ranma screamed and Airanman was blown away into the  bars of the cell opposite Ranma's.</p><p>Ranma slid down the wall, and passed out.</p><p>Akane sneezed.</p><p>Cologne opened her eyes and glanced in Akane's  direction. "Someone talking about you?"</p><p>"I guess," She was sitting with the Amazon elder in  the office of the assistant principle, who was  fishing some papers out of Principle Kuno's office  and so would probably be a while in coming back. She  rubbed her nose and moved to a different position in  her seat. For some reason she thought of waiting  outside of the classroom with Ranma, holding buckets  of water, and she felt like crying again.</p><p>"Last night was hard for you," Cologne observed, "I'm  glad. If you showed up bright eyed and cheerful I  would have been worried."</p><p>"I just..." Akane tried, but there was no easy way to  crystallize the shame into words. Every time she  thought she had finally reached emotional rock bottom  she thought of some other terrible thing she'd said  or done to Ranma and it drove her deeper into the  dirt. "We could have...but the fiancée stuff and then  Shampoo..." she spoke the name with more venom then  she intended. She wanted to blame her for everything,  but she resisted. Even if Shampoo was to blame for  Akane being unable to learn how deal with Ranma, it  was still Akane that had mocked Ranma, jeered at him,  attacked his greatest weakness with a gusto that was  sickening. And there was no way she could make up for  that now. She once... had something with Ranma. There  was... love there once, but now... Could they even be  friends? How could he ever trust her again? How could  she trust herself?</p><p>The family was getting ready to see Ranma and Nabiki  in jail when Akane left home with Cologne to get here.  She could barely face her father and Kasumi, she knew  seeing Nabiki or Ranma was completely out of the  question. She had done too much to even begin to ask  for forgiveness. And what made it worse was knowing  they would give it to her if she asked. They would  forgive her when she had blamed them for everything.</p><p>Becoming Amazon was the only thing that kept Akane  from losing it all together. She had a new chance now.  A new code of honor she could adhere to after she had  shattered her old one. She would not let herself be  weak. She would not fuck this up.</p><p>Cologne nodded. "It's over now. It's good that you  realize that. And Shampoo deserves your vengeance.  But if you want to stand a chance in challenging her,  you must have patience. You are entering a period  where learning will come very easily and patience  will be difficult to maintain. That is why you must  learn patience now. Reckless knowledge is as  potentially disastrous as reckless ignorance."</p><p>Akane closed her eyes and tried to calm herself.  Patience. That was why they were both in this office,  waiting for the assistant principal to return instead  of helping him find the necessary forms so she could  work at the Nekohanten while attending school. Akane  could only imagine what sort of booby traps the  Hawaiian madman might have set up, and it could very  well be that the assistant principal was unconscious  underneath a pile of coconuts or something. She knew  it would be faster to go herself and get the papers,  but she would stay. As maddening as it was, she would  sit and think. And she thought about all the times  where sitting and thinking would have done her so  much good.</p><p>And she felt like crying again.</p><p>Ukyo had never seen so many customers. They just kept  coming in! Ukyo was making three okonomiyaki at once  and still she was working non stop. She knew what it  was of course, but she didn't want to think about it  too much. Her new room mate was more than paying for  herself already. In fact, Shampoo was almost too good  of a waitress.</p><p>Ukyo had evened out Shampoo's shortened hair for her  and she looked cute in the Ucchan's uniform. Ukyo  herself didn't swing that way, but she had spent  enough time in a boy's school to know what guys liked,  and Shampoo was it. She could kid herself that she  was cuter, but it was a conceit that didn't stand up  to scrutiny. If it weren't for the fact that Ranma  liked tomboy types, Ukyo wouldn't have a chance.</p><p>That sneaky bitch Nabiki...</p><p>Ukyo flipped an okonomiyaki too soon and the batter  spattered on her hand, burning her skin. "Fuck." Ukyo  seethed, and she tried to get the image of Nabiki  doing just that to poor innocent, defenseless Ranma  in a city intersection while helicopters flew over  head... out of her troubled mind. They were still  showing it on the news at regular intervals with all  the naughty bits blurred by computers.</p><p>But of course Ranma wasn't innocent. Anybody could  see he was participating just as much as Nabiki. It  just wasn't fair.</p><p>Ukyo focused on the okonomiyaki. She envisioned  pouring all of her negative energy into the batter  letting it all go into the mix. When she finished her  next okonomiyaki, she felt a lot better. She wouldn't  want to serve it to anyone though. It simply wasn't  ethical to serve an okonomiyaki that wasn't made with  love. Taking a short break without letting Shampoo  know, Ukyo took the okonomiyaki with her out the back  door to the yard outside. She threw it Frisbee-like  into the thick trunk of a large deciduous tree. She  wasn't exactly surprised when it exploded, but when  the tree toppled over, Ukyo knew it was time to close  for the day.</p><p>She was getting too many ideas.</p><p>"Unnnh..." Ranma moaned, holding a hand to her head  just above her right eye. "Did anyone get the number  of that …?"</p><p>"Over-used cliché?" Nabiki finished for him. She sat  crosslegged in a plastic chair in the recovery room.  She put down the latest issue of Forbes and tsked.  "You're a bit high maintenance, aren't you, Ranma?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"I mean I'm just after free food and money, but you,  you expect to be rescued from sado-masochistic demons  from the fifth dimension, and on the second date no  less!" Ranma sat up and Nabiki helped her to her feet.  "Daddy and Kasumi are here, having a worrying contest.  So far Daddy's winning with his trademark waterfall  of tears, but Kasumi may be a dark horse candidate  with her incessant hand wringing ."</p><p>"What about Pops?"</p><p>"Oh he came by, but then he said he had to leave.  Family business, he said."</p><p>"Well, sheesh, you're family, why couldn't he tell  you?" Ranma felt odd. Her balance was a little off  and she felt strangely numb. She could feel things  but she couldn't really FEEL them.</p><p>Nabiki kissed Ranma. She felt THAT.</p><p>"What was that for? Not that I'm complaining."</p><p>"I don't know. I haven't been myself lately. So many  things have happened I haven't even really  assimilated and then you…It feels good to be part of  your family, Ranma. I don't know why, but it does."</p><p>Ranma found herself rising to meet Nabiki's lips  again. When she was done she frowned, "Why are Daddy  and... I mean why are your father and Kasumi worried  about me?"</p><p>Nabiki smirked "They saw us having intimate sexual  relations on live television while we were both  acting like cats. More recently they found out while  in jail I was six feet away from a raging demon that  almost killed you. Daddy is beginning to think I'm  standing a little too close to the fire," Nabiki  nudged Ranma. "Kasumi, well...she's just Kasumi."</p><p>Ranma nodded.</p><p>The next second a wooden door with a square window  opened and Kasumi came in. "Oh my," she said.</p><p>Ranma and Nabiki gave themselves a quizzical look.  "What's up, Kasumi?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"We don't have much time. Father will be back soon. I  need to talk to you both."</p><p>"Okaaay…what about?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"It's rather difficult to explain I'm afraid. Ranma-<br/>chan, do you still have the Saiserefu Noon?"</p><p>"Ah…heh, heh," Ranma scratched the back of her head,  "I kind of lost it when Nabiki and I were…"</p><p>"Hmm yes," Kasumi interrupted, "Please, I want you to  think. When exactly was the last time you wore it?"</p><p>"The earrings kind of just fell out after I did that  mind meld with Nabiki"</p><p>Kasumi nodded. She turned away from them and looked  through the window of the door, checking the hallway.</p><p>"What is it, Kasumi?" Nabiki asked."</p><p>Turning to face them both again, Kasumi wrung her  hands and said, "Ranma, Nabiki, I want you to promise  me something. Ranma you're family now too and I think  you respect our family more than your original one.  So I want both of you to swear on the honor of our  departed mother."</p><p>Ranma and Nabiki swallowed. "Swear what exactly?"  Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Don't ever leave each other's side."</p><p>"I swear," Ranma said solemnly</p><p>"Nabiki?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Of course I swear, but why the theatrics, Kasumi? We  weren't planning on being apart anyway."</p><p>"I think something about the… mindmeld caused the  Saiserefu to move from Ranma's earrings to you. You  are now Ranma's Thyself Known."</p><p>Nabiki nodded slowly."That would explain how I knew  what to do when Ranma was fighting Airanman,"</p><p>"That's not all I'm afraid. I think it goes both ways.  Nabiki, Ranma is your Saiserefu just as much as you  are Ranma's. As long as you two are together you'll  be perfectly fine. But if you're apart for very long,  I'm afraid your personality may fracture just as  badly as Ranma's has."</p><p>"How romantic," Nabiki deadpanned.</p><p>"Hold on a second," Ranma interjected, "How do you  know this, Kasumi?"</p><p>Kasumi's brow furrowed. She checked the hallway again.  "Father mustn't find out. It's too dangerous to tell  you everything. When Tofu was fifteen, he lost  something precious…a part of himself. I had to give  him part of myself or he would have died. I was nine  then. You were seven, Nabiki."</p><p>"That was when mom…"</p><p>Kasumi nodded somberly. "Remember I had pneumonia  that month?"</p><p>"It wasn't pneumonia, was it."</p><p>"No." Kasumi checked the hallway again.</p><p>"So you and Tofu did a mind meld too?" Ranma asked,  "But I thought you had to be identical twins or  something?"</p><p>"It wasn't the same thing. It can last a decade,  maybe fifteen years and then…"</p><p>"Death?"</p><p>Kasumi nodded, "'The two will become one.' Tofu and I  had our own Ijuu. We too were our own Thyself Knowns,  but for us, in order to stay ourselves we had to stay  apart. I'm just starting to remember everything that  happened. Tofu must be remembering too. We're…we're  running out of time…" she wiped a tear from her cheek.</p><p>Ranma found herself standing up and putting an arm  around Kasumi before she even realized it. She sat  Kasumi down in one of the chairs and sat next to her.  "We'll find a way to fix this. There has to be  something we can do."</p><p>It was then she noticed that she was holding Nabiki's  hand even as she was comforting Kasumi with the other.  She realized she had said "we" twice. Not "I" but  "we". And she knew then that whatever it was she was  going to do, she was going to do it with Nabiki.</p><p>When Hiro Kawagami woke, his entire body felt like  fruitcake. His eyelids were particularly heavy  fruitcakes, the kind passed around for generations.  When he finally got them open the sandpaper sensation  the air from the dank closet provided made him close  them again promptly.</p><p>His stomach was angry at him about something, it  kept trying to throttle him, but thankfully all it  succeeded in doing was forcing the warm, chunky  remains of the hot dog and coffee he had some twenty  hours ago at the Hot Dog and Coffee out of his  burning esophagus past his epiglottis and all over  the hard wood floor by his head. The vomit stank a  great deal.</p><p>He managed to get into a sitting position, which  seemed like a good idea at the time, but his inner  ear mistook this as an attempt to do a back flip off  world's fastest rollercoaster right after the third  loop. His stomach tried to throttle him again, and in  the midst of all this violence, he fell over, his  shoulder splatting in the puddle of vomit, which had  become cool but no less fragrant for the two or three  minutes he had spent trying to sit up.</p><p>A minute or so passed as Kawagami lay there thinking  of vomit flavored fruitcake. There were a lot of  fruitcakes in Nerima he mentally segued. Maybe  getting tied up, shoved into a closet and drugged was  a normal thing. He wasn't getting paid enough if that  was the case.</p><p>He was just about to try sitting up again when the  closet door opened almost blinding him for a moment  with the light from outside.</p><p>"Morning, sunshine," his own voice taunted at him.  "Well it's two in the afternoon actually, but who the  fuck gives a shit."</p><p>"What do you want?" Kawagami groaned.</p><p>"Revenge. No wait. That's not it. Satisfaction. If it  were just revenge, I'd just let the Ijuu take its  toll on the bastard and watch him fall apart. That'd  be eye for an eye. No, I want the fucker dead. Him  and his bitch."</p><p>"You mean Ranma and Nabiki?"</p><p>"No, I mean the Pope and the Queen of England. Of  course Ranma and Nabiki!"</p><p>Still recovering from his stupor, Kawagami said "Come  on, the Pope and the Queen of England have nothing to  do with each other."</p><p>The figure seemed to ignore him. "They bought you  some time. I was going to kill you chop you into bits  and spread your remains across the countryside, make  a day trip out of it, see the sights. Now that plan's  fucked. The bitch is giving me a way to get close to  her manwhore. Of course it's not going to go down  like she thinks. She thinks I'm going to go  galavanting in there screaming 'I'm alive! Please  arrest me!' But I've got an idea."</p><p>"I suppose you're going to tell it to me, huh? I  thought evil masterminds only did that in movies."</p><p>"Yes, I'm telling you the plan, because you're going  to make it work."</p><p>"Yeah well I'm not going to help you so you might as  well think up a new one."</p><p>Kawagami's eyes had adjusted enough to see the smirk  on the doppelganger's face. Then the fetch waved some  dark cloth across his field of vision. It was like  his entire body were taffy being pulled and  compressed and molded. He felt extremely odd.</p><p>"You're going to help me, or you'll never be Kawagami  Hiro again."</p><p>" What do you—" Kawagami started, but then he stopped.  That was not his voice. Much too high. That was…that  was…</p><p>"Get up, Tomo Hoko, I'm taking you to the police  station. Inamura's going to have a lot questions to  ask, but I'm sure between the two of us we can set  him straight, don't you think?"</p><p>Author's Note</p><p>Okay. It's been a long time since I did a chapter on  this. I'm sorry to have left you hanging with that  last, but there were several problems I had with the  politics of the police station and such. I'm sure  someone will catch some glaring error and I'll have  to go back and change something, but for now this is  the chapter.</p><p>I suppose I have to face facts, the plot point that  I'm planning between Ranma and his mother has been  irrevocably sublimated by everything else. I'll  eventually get to it, but not before a hundred other  things happen, and that's likely to take a very long  time. I'm in Grad School now and I'm working on  several original fiction works and so chapters are  going to come even slower. I only finished this  because several people emailed me about it.</p><p>Anyway I do plan on continuing this, and I thank you  for bearing with me as time slogs forward like a  forwardly slogging thing.</p><p>It gets weirder.</p><p>7/15/05 : Added Ranma's dream. Made some other  changes.</p><p>Thanks, Abdiel, for critiquing</p><p>And thanks as well to the reviewers of</p>
