Over and out.</p><p><b>WHAT  HAS COME BEFORE</b>:</p><p>Ranma  and Nabiki were arrested for having sex in public. While in jail,  Ranma had an encounter with a trans-dimensional demon calling itself  Iron Man. Nabiki saved him by promising to cause him more pain than  he could possibly imagine. Meanwhile Copycat, having disguised  himself as officer Kawagami Hiro and having disguised officer  Kawagami Hiro as a dead eighteen-year-old girl, now prepares to make  his entrance to the police station, having worked a deal with Nabiki  to get close to Ranma so he can kill him. Nabiki expects she'll be  able to control the situation and get the serial killer doppelganger  arrested. This isn't going to go how anyone expects.</p><p><b>Reviewers  whose advice I've taken (I think):</b></p><p>Abdie (wwwdotfloresticadotcom/abdiel/indexdothtm)</p><p>Innortal  (wwwdotfanfictiondotnet/u/681915/)</p><p>-ch.8:Stuck-</p><p>"He longed to  forget himself altogether, to forget everything and then to wake up  and begin life anew…"</p><p>Fyodor Dostoyevsky,  Crime and Punishment</p><p>-11  years ago-</p><p>She  walked through the twilight, a terrible beast that left homes broken  and ragged in her wake. She was many stories tall with bloody  obsidian spikes that jutted out two or three feet from her knees and  elbows. Her skin was pus colored, her eyes pure black, her hair made  up of maggots. Smoke curled from her mouth and nostrils. Acid dripped  from her vagina.</p><p>"Get  inside." Tofu's father told him and his mother. The hair of the  man, already graying at 45, blew in an unnatural wind as he stood on  the porch of their home. "Did you hear me? I said get inside! Now!"</p><p>"I  have to perform the ritual!" Tofu's mother cried in protest amid  the increasing rush of wind. At forty, she still retained much of her  beauty. She was tall and graceful as the wind whipped her hair and  the folds of her dress. She cradled a great grimoire against her  chest. "It's our only hope!"</p><p>"No.  That's a last resort. I can see its ki patterns. If I can get close  enough, I should be able to disable it."</p><p>"Get  close to it? She'll rip you to shreds!"</p><p>"It  wants me," Tofu said, his young, timid voice almost too quiet to  hear over the rush of wind. "This is my fight." Before his  parents could protest, he let his thoughts turn black. He raised his  hand, palm outstretched, as even now he was cloaked in a dark aura.  He was too late to save his friends, but if he had the power to give  life, then he had the power to take it away.</p><p>"NO,  Son! That's what she wants! She…"</p><p>But  Tofu didn't hear the rest of his father's words. Everything  became a blur.</p><p>There  was movement, cries of surprise, of pain. He felt something snap. He  heard his mother say the words of a prayer: <i>"Oh goddess  Amateresu, of both unearthly beauty and unparalleled strength. Hear  my cry. You have granted me beauty and I am grateful, but, please,  take it away. Take it away and replace it with the strength to defeat  my enemy."</i></p><p>There  was a tingle of magic, like static electricity across the skin. A  scream. Words of anger, words of hate. And finally another, more  terrible scream, of something inhuman. A loud crash. Then the words:  <i>"I am defeated, widow, but know that the same curse that has  slain me, has also slain your son."</i> The words were raspy and  had a feminine tone. They came though, from Tofu's throat.</p><p>-the  present-</p><p>"Ono-sensei?'</p><p>Tofu  jerked awake from the makeshift desk he had made in one of the spare  examination rooms of the hospital. He was often called upon for  special cases, having developed something of a reputation. The  hospital paid him discreetly for his services, but could not  officially hire him for political reasons. Tofu accepted this and had  even enjoyed his "office away from his office" on the occasions  when he worked for the main hospital. He hadn't gotten much sleep  last night however and the lull while he waited for the results of  Ranma's tests proved too much for him.</p><p>He  had nodded off. Tofu recovered as best he could. "Yes? Oh. You  have the x-rays ready?"</p><p>The  young woman nodded. She was only a year younger than Tofu, but still  only a med student. "There seems to be some form of metal melted in  an asymmetric ring around the ninth thoracic vertebra. I don't  suppose you could tell me how that happened?"</p><p>"Not  without severely damaging your understanding of the laws of physics,  I'm afraid," Tofu smiled tiredly, "At this point in your  education it's best just to assume the universe behaves like it's  supposed to. After you get your PhD, if they haven't drained you of  all curiosity, you can look me up and I'll tell you all about it."</p><p>"I'll  have to take you up on that, Doctor. Anyway, here you go." She  handed him the manila envelope with the x-rays. "The blood work  will be a little longer."</p><p>"Thanks…"  Tofu read the girl's nametag, "Yamaguchi-san, this should be fine  for now. The blood work was just an extra precaution."</p><p>The  girl smiled, bowed slightly, said "Well then! I'll leave you to  your work," and left the doorway rather quickly.</p><p>As  Tofu studied the x-rays, it slowly dawned on him that the girl was  probably flirting with him. He tried to recall if she was attractive  and found he couldn't remember what she looked like. He shook his  head free of it. He was committed to Kasumi, and that meant he was  effectively celibate until…</p><p>Another  realization rose slowly out of the murky waters of his thoughts. His  dream…was no dream. Eleven years ago, he had killed his father,  forced his mother to sacrifice her beauty, and had been cursed to die  a slow and painful death. Only Kasumi…she was only nine years old  but she came to him on his death bead, laid her hands on his chest  and somehow filled the cold emptiness that had been inside him with  something warm and bright.</p><p>He  wasn't supposed to remember this. The memories were supposed to be  sealed off until…</p><p>Until  Tofu had need of them again. Until he began the Migration anew. Tofu  could now count himself, as well as Kasumi if his suspicions were  correct, among those Ranma's Ijuu had taken. Where would Ranma lead  them?</p><p>Tofu  rubbed his eyes. <i>One crisis at a time</i>, he counseled himself.  Right now he had to figure out how to tell Ranma this new bit of bad  news without him inadvertently blowing away a wing of the hospital in  a blind rage. After he did that, THEN he could start to worry about  whether the boy was leading everyone he knew into certain doom.</p><p>-waiting  room-</p><p>Everyone  except Akane and Genma was sitting in the waiting room when Tofu  entered. His eyes fell on Kasumi, and he paused. So beautiful. She  had saved his life that day eleven years ago. He remembered now and  wished he didn't. "The two shall become one" That was the  wording. What did that mean? Would he or Kasumi die? Would they merge  somehow? Would that be different from death?</p><p>Tofu  shook his head. There was still time for him and Kasumi. What he had  to tell Ranma was more urgent. "Ranma?" He called from the  doorway.</p><p>The  redhead looked up, "Yeah?"</p><p>"Could  I talk to you alone for a second?"</p><p>"Sure."  Ranma got up and was halfway to the door when she stopped and glanced  back "Hey Firefly, you coming or what?"</p><p>Nabiki  snapped back from some reverie she was in, and Tofu saw the reason  for Ranma's nickname. Her aura went from nothing to bright green  and then back again. <i>She stifles her ki. Doesn't even realize  she's doing it. </i>When they both got through the door Tofu  smiled, "I did say that I wanted to talk to you alone, Ranma, but  this is probably better."</p><p>"Yeah,  well what is it?"</p><p>"I  talked with the doctor here and I had a good look at your X-ray. By  all accounts you should be dead."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"You  say molten iron shot from this demon into your chest?"</p><p>"That's  what happened, I was there too," Nabiki confirmed.</p><p>"Yet  you seem to be fine. Not even a scar or burn mark."</p><p>"Detective  Inamura said that Airanman could only be defeated by force of will. I  think the molten iron was just an illusion," Nabiki pointed out.</p><p>"Yeah,"  Ranma agreed, "It's extremely painful, but once you realize it  doesn't exist you can fight through it."</p><p>Tofu  grimaced. "I'm afraid the molten iron is going to have a good TRY  at existing."</p><p>"What  do you mean?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>Tofu  pulled a transparency out of a manila folder. "This is Ranma's  X-ray." He held it up to the light so they could both see. "Look  here, about the second vertebra down from the rib cage." Where Tofu  pointed, there was an uneven ring of pure white. Something the X-rays  couldn't pass through at all.</p><p>"That's  iron, isn't it," Ranma said flatly.</p><p>"Not  quite. I agree with you and Nabiki that it couldn't just be iron.  The way it's shaped is wrong for molten metal flowing around an  obstruction for one thing. Nevertheless, while whatever this Airanman  did to you may have had an illusory characteristic, it was at least  partially real."</p><p>"That  would explain why my balance has been off since I woke up."</p><p>"Yes,  but there are some other things you might not have considered, Ranma.  If an enemy of yours gets a hold of a high powered magnet you could  be in serious trouble. You won't be able to pass through metal  detectors if you need to go through an airport or high security area.  But these are minor compared to what I'm about to tell you."</p><p>"What  is it, doc? I'm getting sick of this."</p><p>"Ranma…women's  vertebrae are on average twenty to twenty-five percent smaller than  men's after taking differences in size into account. It's one of  the reasons why women are more at risk for osteoporosis. This metal  is wrapped tightly around your vertebra now when you are female. What  happens if you turn male?"</p><p>"Wait  a minute, this isn't a normal metal. Maybe if he turns male again  it will just grow to fit the new body."</p><p>Ranma  shook her head. "No, Nabiki, the bastard wanted me female. He got  off on it, he wanted me to be his 'death doll'. If you hadn't  shown up…" Ranma's fists clenched.</p><p>Tofu  sucked in a breath. The aura wasn't too excited or dark; Ranma was  taking the news surprisingly well…but he could still be very close  to dying horribly right now. "It's possible there wouldn't be a  problem, it's true," Tofu allowed, "But if I'm right about  this, and what Ranma has just said makes me think that I am, then  turning male could paralyze him for life. I've treated him enough  to know his injuries carry over when he changes forms."</p><p>This  wasn't exactly true, Tofu reflected. In fact most minor injuries  seemed to heal as soon as Ranma changed forms, but Tofu decided  against mentioning this. Major injuries did carry over, and if Ranma  became paralyzed it might push him over the edge. And if Ranma went  over the edge he'd drag everyone else with him.</p><p>"Fine,"  Nabiki said, "So how do we remove it?"</p><p>Tofu  had no response for that. He could feel Ranma's aura changing,  becoming darker.</p><p>"It's  metal melted around my spinal chord. They're not going to be able  to fix that. You're the one who said I should get used to being a  girl, Nabiki. Guess now I don't have a choice." Ranma turned and  started walking away.</p><p>Something  was odd here, Tofu realized. Ranma was too quick to accept this.  Almost as if he knew ahead of time. Come to think of it, why hadn't  he tried to change earlier? <i>One problem at a time,</i> Tofu  reminded himself. As long as Ranma didn't change, he should be okay  at least from a physical standpoint. Tofu thought of something  though, just as he was about to turn around. "Ranma!" Tofu called  out, "Your curse has changed. All you have to do is change your  mood and you're male again. It's a miracle you haven't turned  back already. How can you be sure that that won't happen now?"</p><p>Ranma  stopped and faced Tofu from down the long hallway "Mom's coming  to visit this week." Her eyes somehow intense and dead at the same  time. "I'm not going to be feeling 'manly' for a while."  Then she turned and ran down the hall.</p><p>"Idiot,"  Nabiki said and started to rush toward Ranma.</p><p>Tofu  stopped her with a hand on her shoulder. "Remember, Nabiki, Ranma  has to remain female, or he…"</p><p>"Tofu-sensei,"  Nabiki interrupted, pulling his hand off her shoulder, "I  understand you are trying to help. But if you <i>ever</i> keep me  from my fiance again, you will regret it."</p><p>Tofu  let her go and she ran off down the hall. He could have sworn  Nabiki's eyes flashed bright green for a split second before  returning to their usual brown. <i>She is part of the migration now  too.</i> It made perfect sense that she would be, after she and  Ranma's mind melding and all. Still, the idea that Nabiki might  eventually become one of the most powerful martial artists in the  world and possibly play a key role in halting the spread of  Armageddon was a bit hard to take.</p><p>Tofu's  stomach gurgled wretchedly. He walked hurriedly down the hall,  praying to the gods he had enough money to get an antacid from the  snack machine. He grit his teeth. <i>One crisis at a time. First keep  my stomach acid from digesting me from the inside, THEN worry about  the fate of the world resting in the hands of a few impetuous  teenagers.</i></p><p>-women's  restroom-</p><p>Nabiki  opened the door. Ranma was sitting on the tiled floor, her back  against the wall next to the sink, her head was between her knees.  Nabiki heard a sob. <i>It's not fair.</i></p><p>Nabiki  sat down next to the redhead. She looked up at the fluorescent lights  in the ceiling and sighed. "It's not supposed to be fair,  Ranchan. It's like a poker game with the odds stacked against you.  Sometimes you have to play dirty. Sometimes you have to know when to  fold."</p><p>"I  suck at poker."</p><p>Nabiki  smiled slightly. "Don't sell yourself short, Ranma-baby. You got  me in there with you now."</p><p>"Heh.  Yeah, I suppose." Ranma looked away brushing moisture from her  eyes.</p><p>Nabiki  frowned. She didn't like this side of Ranma. Ranma never cried unless  he was under some sort of magic compulsion.</p><p>"Don't  worry, Fly, I'll probably be insanely happy in a couple minutes,"  Ranma said dryly. "I don't like this either, you know."</p><p>Nabiki  paused. She was sure she hadn't said anything. "You're not the  only one having a bad day, Ranchan." Nabiki</p><p>"I  found out earlier today that my best friend Hoko died. A doppelganger  took her body and killed her. We saw the killer yesterday at Tofu's.  I thought something was odd about her but…" Nabiki sucked in air.  <i>Great, now </i>I <i>feel like crying.</i></p><p>"Why  don't you?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Cry.  I mean, you're a girl, you don't need to hold yourself back or  anything. I haven't even seen you really upset. I know you get  depressed sometimes. I remember the…the gun. I just don't get why  you hide it."</p><p>"Daddy  cries all the time, and he's a man. He wasn't worth much after  Mom died. I had to find ways to pay the bills, to keep us from  starving. There was a time I really hated him. I didn't want to be  anything like him. I still don't. Now that I don't have to rely  on him, I don't hate him anymore, but every time I think of  breaking down and crying, I think of him sitting alone in his room  all day, doing just that while the food and money ran out and  everything was falling apart." Nabiki leaned back against the cold  tile of the bathroom wall. "Crying doesn't solve anything. It  just makes things worse."</p><p>Nabiki  looked at Ranma, tears drying on the shorter girl's face. <i>I  don't deserve to be a man.</i> "The only thing worse than  crying is self pity," Nabiki said sharply and looked away.</p><p>"Hoko  wanted to be a reporter, you know. That was her dream. She was head  of the school paper. I read it every once in a while. Some of the  articles were really good. There was one she wrote about a possible  match up between Ms Satori and Mr. Otonabe. It was all very innocent,  but she made it sound scandalous, like they were doing something  naughty. Well of course I wanted her in charge of information  retrieval.</p><p>"I  had the inside scoop on what Akane, Kuno, and later on, you were up  to, and that's what everyone was interested in. But Hoko, she knew  everything about <i>everybody</i>. She was my edge in the betting  pools. With her and Yuki, I could do almost anything. And at first,  yes, I was just using them, but then I found myself doing things for  them, things that weren't financially lucrative, and they would  help me out if one of my nastier schemes ever surfaced. I think one  day Hoko said something like 'We're your friends, you can tell  us,' and that's really when it dawned on me. Yuki and I drifted  somewhat since she became popular, but Hoko and I stayed close. She  was my best friend."</p><p>Nabiki  turned to Ranma, who was listening intently. "She was my best  friend, and this bastard killed her."</p><p>"I  had no idea. I didn't even think you had friends before we…"</p><p>"That's  not all. There was this quiet kid in school, maybe you ran into him,  Buntaro?"</p><p>Ranma  shook her head.</p><p>"Probably  did and didn't even realize it; He was so withdrawn. Then one day  he starts asking people questions and taking pictures. That's when  I first noticed him, really. I asked him what was going on, and he  said 'family trouble.' I don't know why, but I asked if he  wanted to do some work for me. He declined, which is already a little  odd, but then he had this strange look of surprise and guilt on his  face, and then he ran off. I did some more investigation and there  was really nothing remarkable about him except his parents were  getting a divorce. They seemed like nice people when I talked to  them, though. A week later I was the only high school student at his  funeral. It was just me, his parents and this weird police officer  who asked how I knew Buntaro. I said something, I forget what, and  the cop gave me the same look Buntaro gave. He didn't run away like  Buntaro did, but it seemed like he wanted to. He just turned and  walked off.</p><p>"Today  I found out Buntaro was killed exactly the same way as Hoko. I'm  positive the killer was the same person. And then there's  Tanaka-sensei. About a month ago she disappeared. Just drove off  without explanation."</p><p>"You  think she was killed."</p><p>Nabiki  nodded, "I'm almost sure of it."</p><p>"Gosunkugi!  He disappeared just last week!"</p><p>"It  could be unrelated, but…"</p><p>"Like  hell it's unrelated. Damn it, Gos was a freaky guy but he didn't  deserve <i>that.</i>"</p><p>"Careful,  Ranma."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"You  were about to change into a boy."</p><p>"Shit.  I was, wasn't I?"</p><p>"Look,  Ranchan, we've got different priorities now. Yes, you're stuck as  a girl. Big deal, so am I. We have a killer to catch and we don't  need a penis to do that."</p><p>Ranma's  expression darkened. "You don't understand, do you? You've  never had my curse, you don't have any memory that fits the  feeling. This is not me, Nabiki. I am not a girl. I can't just give  up and start wearing dresses and watching soap operas."</p><p>There  was silence for a good while, and then Nabiki stood. "Okay. As much  as I'd like to discuss this, we don't exactly have time to  separate your ingrained chauvinism from your actual sexual identity.  I think that would take years. The important thing right now is that  for a while at least you <i>have</i> to give up."</p><p>Ranma  looked up sharply at her.</p><p>"Look,  it won't be permanent. I know you're really a man, whatever that  means, but you're a girl for now. So…be a girl."</p><p>"I  don't think I can do that. Being a man is a part of me. I can't  change that even if I wanted to."</p><p>"I  know, Ranchan," Nabiki hugged Ranma awkwardly on the floor of  restroom, "But just let it go. You have to let it go."</p><p>Nabiki  hugged Ranma tightly for almost a minute. She felt as if she was  being filled by something. Something warm and painful. It was almost  like sex, but not quite. Something was off. She began to feel odd.  Ranma seemed to shrink slightly in her arms. She opened her eyes saw  the way Ranma's aura was behaving and realized what was happening  after it was too late to do anything about it.</p><p>Nabiki  released Ranma and stood up. She looked at herself in the mirror. She  touched her face, felt her chest. It was no longer <i>her </i>face  though, no longer <i>her</i> chest. She didn't look like Ranma. She  could recognize her own features, but they were more squared off,  masculine. There was no getting around it. Nabiki was now male. "Damn  it, Ranma," Nabiki said in her…in <i>his </i>now tenor voice.  "That wasn't what I meant."</p><p>-ucchan's-</p><p>"That's  not what I meant!" Ukyo exclaimed exasperated, "Just because I  hate them doesn't mean I want to kill them!"</p><p>"Why  not?" Shampoo asked. "Nabiki is obstacle, she is for killing  then, yes? If Ranma no want to be Airen, he for killing too."</p><p>Everyone  was gone from the restaurant and Shampoo and she were sitting on  Ukyo's sofa upstairs. It was a bit threadbare, she had found it in  a dump and never got around to replacing it, but it was homey in a  way. Comfortable. Entirely not the place to be conspiring to murder  anyone. "Shampoo, I can't believe you. You would actually take a  human life, not just human life, but RANMA life over this?"</p><p>"You  say hate, but you protect… Why?"</p><p>"I  don't know! I do hate him. I hate him because I can't love him. I  hate him because I can't really hate him either. But I don't want  to kill him. Or Nabiki for that matter."</p><p>"Amazon  law very clear on this subject," Shampoo noted.</p><p>"You're  not an Amazon anymore, Shampoo. And anyway if you're so keen on  killing them why don't you try it then?"</p><p>Shampoo  slumped in her seat. "Is true. Amazon law very clear but Shampoo…my  feeling not so clear. One reason why I not Amazon anymore. But maybe  we could almost kill? Send to hospital for couple days? I feel much  better then."</p><p>"THAT  sounds tempting," Ukyo considered. She could understand where  Shampoo was coming from. Shampoo had been unable to control herself  as soon as she saw Ranma. She was angry at him for taking away her  control, but then Nabiki comes in out of the blue and screws the only  human she had any sexual attraction to. She had good reason to feel  like killing them. Ukyo herself was angry for much more banal  reasons. It wasn't fair for Nabiki to do what she did. Unlike Shampoo  she knew exactly what she was doing. And Ranma….Ukyo felt betrayed.  Again. "I don't know about almost killing them but I think we  need to do <i>something</i>. Something violent, just to get it out of  our systems."</p><p>"I  no want get violence out of system. I like violence. I want get  mercenary girl out of system."</p><p>"No,  that's not what I mean. It's an expression. To get something out  of your system means to satisfy your need for that something."</p><p>Shampoo  frowned. "That no make sense. If I hungry and I eat, I no get food  out of system, I put food in."</p><p>Ukyo  thought about that for a moment. "I think in that situation, it's  a little odd, but I think you would say 'I need to get this hunger  out of my system.' It's only supposed to last a little while in  most cases when you use the expression. Like when I exercise  sometimes it's to get the stiffness out of my system." Ukyo  frowned herself. None of the examples she could think of really fit.</p><p>"I  think I see. It like you get rid of need but it come back. I get  leaving Ranma out of system, but it no last. I get leaving old hag  out of system but now I miss. I get leaving Amazons out of system but  I still feel like Amazon inside. I feel good for while and then bad  feelings come. It probably be same with almost killing Ranma and  mercenary girl."</p><p>Ukyo  nodded dumbly, wondering again at what kind of person Shampoo would  have been if it hadn't been for her overbearing great grandmother.  Shaking her head free of the re-appraisal of her one time foe, she  said, "We should do this the right way. We'll issue a challenge.  Ranma will probably win but we'll feel better for a while. Maybe."</p><p>Shampoo  shook her head. "You challenge Ranma. I challenge mercenary girl."</p><p>"Huh?  But she doesn't know martial arts."</p><p>"She  know nekoken. She probably know other moves too, just not show all  this time. I think she ten times better than Akane even if she not as  strong."</p><p>Ukyo  remembered running with Nabiki, how out of breath she was, but how  determined. "She's out of shape, but you're right. How could  she learn the nekoken and not be a martial artist?"</p><p>"She  hide for many year, stay in background, but she just get abandoning  Art out of system. She come back to it now."</p><p>Ukyo  had never really thought about Nabiki before, the few times she had  really interacted with her had been over Ranma or money. Usually both  at the same time. Amidst all the craziness of Nerima, Nabiki seemed  to be one of the few people really in control of the situation. But  maybe that was because she was never really in the situation. She was  Switzerland, a neutral party. Now she had chosen a side. Now she was  in the war. <i>So what side am </i>I<i> on? </i>Ukyo wondered, W<i>ho  am I fighting?</i></p><p>-tomo  residence-</p><p>Hiro  couldn't help staring at his now smaller, feminine arms and hands.  There were other, more dramatic changes, but that was too much to  handle right now. He felt out of synch with this body. It wasn't  his, it didn't move like it was supposed to. He was still a man  just some how forced to take on the form of this poor seventeen year  old girl that got killed.</p><p>"Yeah.  You're a teenage cunt now. Get over it. We've got to go." The  imposter sneered in Hiro's stolen body.</p><p><i>You  have to stop him.</i></p><p>But  how was he going to stop him? <i>Take his blanket and camera away and  capture him. Either that or kill him.</i> Hiro blinked, what camera?  He didn't know anything about a camera.</p><p>"Hoko-chan?"  Mrs. Tomo called out. "Is that you? I was about to call the  police…" Tomo-san entered the room to find what looked like a  young cop in police blues in her daughter's room with someone who  looked like her daughter dressed in designer jeans and a red short  sleeved blouse. "Oh," she said, completely unaware that the "cop"  was a shape shifting serial killer and her "daughter" was in fact  a traffic cop who had moved to Nerima because of its low (reported)  crime rate and reputation for quirkiness.</p><p><i>Yeah,  quirky. You try watching from a spiritual limbo while your lifeless  body is hacked apart by a deranged lunatic and see how quirky it  seems then.</i></p><p>Hiro  closed his eyes and took a breath. He was not hearing voices. It was  just nerves. Being transmogrified probably did a lot to a man's  system.</p><p>"I'm  very sorry, Tomo-san," the freak in cop's clothing bowed to  Hoko's mother, "I should have called. Hoko here was a witness to  a very serious crime. She's a bit shaken up. I thought I'd bring  her here before I took her to the police department for questioning.  Maybe you'd like to come with us?"</p><p>Mrs.  Tomo nodded. "Let me just call my husband. He's coming home early  tonight and he'll be worried if Hoko and I aren't here."</p><p><i>NO!  Mom can't come with us, he'll kill her! </i></p><p>Hiro  was still not hearing voices, but the voice he wasn't hearing  seemed to have a point. "Um…Mom?" Hiro tried, "maybe you  should stay home? This should ah…only take a moment, and then I'll  be back."</p><p>Mrs.  Tomo paused in mid-dial. "It would be better if I could get some  food in him when he comes in. Kenta's a real bear when he hasn't  eaten," she explained to the imposter officer. "Are you sure  you're okay?" She asked Hiro.</p><p>"Yes  ma'am" he responded, and it was odd that this standard cop's  response worked just as well for a teenaged daughter. Same polite  form, different levels of social class. Then again maybe there was  something more to it. Maybe every time a cop arrests a perp, he's  really arresting his own father or mother. <i>Yeah, or maybe you're  just retarded.</i></p><p>"Okay,  honey. I'll let you go by yourself. But I want to hear everything  when you get back, okay?"</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Hiro  felt some indescribable area of his consciousness relax slightly, and  suddenly he knew the voice he had been hearing was Hoko. -<i>A  brilliant deduction, Inspector Obvious.-</i></p><p>Now  that he had made the connection, the voice was more distinct and  separate from his own thoughts. He could catch more of the sound of  it and even a vague sense of the gestures that Hoko would use if she  were physically present. It was a little like talking to a good  friend on the phone, except he had never met Hoko.</p><p>"I'll  have her back in a jiffy, Tomo-san" the imposter said and let Hiro  out with a firm grip on Hoko's thin shoulder. Hiro gained some  solace from that. It was Hoko's shoulder, not his. He felt  deflated, weak. Where he was supposed to have muscle was just skin  and bone. His voice had none of the rumbling cadence it once carried.  His body was stolen, but he would get it back. Hiro glared up at  the…creature wearing his face. He'd get his body back, and then  he'd take great pleasure in making sure this thing was dead.</p><p>-<i>I  guess we're on the same page there at least. But it's not just  you and me. Copycat, that's what this freak calls himself, has  killed four people including me and he'll keep killing until he  gets his revenge on Ranma.- </i>Hiro and Copycat were in the garage  now. Copycat was opening the garage door.</p><p>-<i>What  did Ranma do to him?-</i> Hiro thought back at Hoko's voice.</p><p>-<i>This  guy used to be called Copycat Ken. He used to have a normal form that  he would always go back to, but then in a fight with Ranma he  overused that cloth of his and lost track of…well… himself. Now  he wants to get back at Ranma for making him lose his identity.  That's about all I know. I remember Nabiki mentioned him a couple  months ago, but at the time she seemed to think it was just a  harmless challenger-.</i></p><p>The  garage door was raised almost to the roof, revealing the  mid-afternoon sun. Hiro shielded his eyes against the glare. Copycat,  for his part, didn't seem to mind the sun at all. "You don't  need to worry about your eyes anymore, dumbass. They're  different…now?"</p><p>Copycat  grabbed Hiro's teenage girl chin and looked at his eyes. "What  the fuck? You're eyes are blue! They're supposed to be brown. How  the hell…It doesn't matter. Get on the bike I'll think of  something on the way…"</p><p>Hiro  stood defiantly.</p><p>"Or  maybe you'd like to stay in that body forever? Get a move on,  bitch, I want this thing over with."</p><p>"Wouldn't  it be better to take the police bike?"</p><p>"Well,  gee, I <i>would</i> but <i>you</i> said that <i>your</i> bike would  be faster and you could get home quicker, didn't you, Hoko?"</p><p><i>-The  creep just wants to try out my wheels.- </i>Hoko's voice grumbled.</p><p>Hiro  got on the bike and Copycat sat in front of him. After a few revs of  the engine, a slyly smiling Copycat wearing Hiro's body sped out of  the Tomo family garage. Hiro had to squint his eyes almost shut  against the brightness of the day.</p><p>-hospital-</p><p>Ranma  giggled.</p><p>This  was so great! "Never gonna be a boy again! Never gonna be a boy  again!" she sing-songed softly to herself as she followed Nabiki  back to the waiting room. Poor Nabiki though, he'd have to deal  with being a boy now. He was handsome enough that the girls would  start fighting over him soon if they didn't get married right away.</p><p>All  her life this was what she longed for. Not to be a girl exactly but  to be free of having to be a man. Of having to be manly all the time.  It was all so stupid she realized now, the things she did. Rising to  her father's taunts when she could have just called him an idiot  and ignored him. The nekoken training would have never happened if  she hadn't been trying to be so manly. But then again neither would  Jusenkyo, and then she'd still be a stupid boy.</p><p>The  itch, that terrible feeling of wrongness she usually felt when she  was a girl, wasn't there now. If anything she felt more in tune  with her body than ever. She could only hope she could stay like this  forever. She could even deal with Mom now, she thought. As long as  there wasn't any chance of her being a boy again she could be her  niece, maybe even her daughter eventually if Ranma ever found a way  to reveal the truth to her.</p><p>She'd  have to go as Ranko from now on, she realized. She still didn't  care for the name. She was still a boy before when she first used it,  and did a lot of stupid boy things under that alias. Maybe she could  get a middle name. Something sweet and graceful like Yuki or Tomie.  In the meantime though she'd be Ranko. Maybe she would learn to  like it.</p><p>Ranko  wondered which personality she was at the moment. She wasn't quite  the girl she first became when she hit her head, and she certainly  wasn't her original self. Some combination maybe? It didn't  really matter.</p><p>Detective  Inamura intercepted Ranko in the hall. He was standing with a  short, flabby, uniformed man with a patch over the left eye. Nabiki  stopped and turned around to see what was up. "Hello, Ranma is it?"</p><p>Ranko  nodded.</p><p>"Could  you tell me where to find Nabiki? We need her back at the  station."</p><p>Ranko  pointed at Nabiki. "He's right there, detective," she said  brightly.</p><p>"Huh?"  the goateed man said intelligently.</p><p>"I'm  Nabiki Tendo," Nabiki said, "Sorry about this."</p><p>Ranko  couldn't help it. She burst out laughing.</p><p>"That's  what you said, isn't it?" Nabiki's eyes widened, "When you  first came…"</p><p>But  she was still laughing.</p><p>"Ranko,  it wasn't that funny." Nabiki growled.</p><p>"I  thought her name was Ranma, " Inamura said.</p><p>Nabiki  frowned. <i>Why did I call her Ranko?</i> "That's the name she  uses when she's a girl." Nabiki explained to Inamura.</p><p>Why  <i>did</i> Nabiki call her Ranko, Ranko wondered. Ranko also wondered  how it was that she knew that Nabiki wondered why she called Ranko  Ranko. She had to swallow and count to ten to stifle the new urge to  giggle at the absurdity of it all.</p><p>"Listen,  we kind of need to reveal our…predicament to our family, and I'm  not sure how long that will take. I should be there in maybe half an  hour?"</p><p>Inamura  shook his head. "The doppelganger and Hiro are on their way right  now."</p><p>"How  do you know that?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>Inamura  gestured to the short, flabby, uniformed man with the patch.  "Sergeant Suzuki here is keeping an eye on them."</p><p>Sergeant  Suzuki tapped the edge of his eye patch.</p><p>Nabiki  grimaced. "I still have to let them know what's happened. I'll  get out of there as soon as possible though."</p><p>Inamura  nodded.</p><p>When  they got back to the waiting room everyone was there, except Genma  and Akane. Ranko realized she missed them. Akane's insults  yesterday hadn't really been all that bad. In fact they had been  accurate. Ranko <i>was</i> a girlie girl. It was still a little mean,  because of course at the time she had been sensitive about that, but  really it was no worse than the terrible things <i>Ranma </i> had  said to Akane. Uncute. Tomboy. Unsexy. It's a wonder Akane had  taken it as long as she had.</p><p>Ranko  made a mental note to be sure and apologize to Akane as soon as  possible, before the poor girl did something stupid like pick a fight  with the other fiancees or try to join the Amazons to improve her  self esteem.</p><p>-furinkan  high school, vice principal's office-</p><p>Akane  heard a loud crash come from the hallway, followed by what sounded  like an avalanche of pineapples. Either that or coconuts. Then again  bananas were in season right now…</p><p>"Couldn't  we just-" Akane started.</p><p>"No,  child,"</p><p>Cologne</p><p>said,  "let the man do his job"</p><p>"But  if he's hurt…"</p><p>"He'll  survive."</p><p>Akane  was beginning to go insane.</p><p>"Patience,  child,"</p><p>Cologne  advised, with a hint of malevolence in  her smile. "It's only been an hour."</p><p>Akane  groaned. This had to be some adaptation of Chinese water torture.  Only without the water.</p><p>There  was another sound of heavy blunt objects falling.</p><p>Maybe  this was Chinese pineapple torture.</p><p>-parking  lot-</p><p>Copycat  dismounted from Hoko's bike. He was having second and third  thoughts about this plan. He should just find someone else to copy  and escape while he still could. But he had worked so hard finding  Hoko and preparing to strike with her. If it wasn't for the damn  ijuu taking Ranma when it did…</p><p>But  there was nothing he could do about it now. Besides, he got a new  technique out of the deal. Copycat smiled, thinking of the surprise  that would be on his arch nemesis's face when he used the nekoken  against him. First thing's first though. He had to get himself out  of this mess.</p><p>Hiro  got off Hoko's bike slowly, sullenly. The cop in Hoko's body  seemed resigned to HER fate. That was good. But why hadn't the eyes  changed? Was the demon blanket losing some of its power? Or was  there something special about Hiro that Copycat hadn't picked up  on?</p><p>"Get  moving, bitch, the show's about to start," Copycat said,  dismissing his misgivings and shoving Hiro in the back toward the  station with his foot, almost knocking the neo-girl over. Whatever  was going to happen, it would happen soon.</p><p>-nerima  pd-</p><p>In  the police department, Nabiki was feeling out of sorts He had told  his father what happened with him and Ranko in the bathroom. When the  inevitable wailing ensued, he had been prepared to completely ignore  it and leave the room, but Ranko…she sat next to him, put an arm  around him and said that she and Nabiki would figure it all out. He  thought it was completely stupid at the time. Didn't she know his  father was just going to blubber on no matter what? But then Nabiki  had stopped his train of thought and wondered: <i>When did I stop  loving my father?</i></p><p>He  didn't care about his father at all anymore. Before, even though he  hadn't respected the man much, he still felt something for him, but  now…It was Ranma's twisted sense of manhood, Nabiki realized.  When Ranma hoisted it onto him, he lost all ability to empathize with  anyone. Even Ranko seemed alien now to him. He couldn't figure her  out, why she was so forgiving of everyone, so accommodating. Didn't  she have an opinion? Wasn't she angry she had to be a girl?</p><p>The  funny thing was Ranma had been like that before to a degree. Ranma  had never held a grudge, had always made friends out of his enemies,  but he had never been as pure about it as Ranko was now.</p><p>Nabiki  felt sadness over his inability to feel, turn almost instantly into  anger. He had to hit a wall with his fist to expel the emotion. It  wasn't that he didn't feel, he realized. Somewhere inside him, he  still loved his father, but he simply wasn't allowed to even admit  it. Emotions were forbidden territory now. All of Nabiki's  machinations, which as a girl had seemed mostly innocent, now were  unforgivable. The joy he had experienced in seeing the  conflicts within people sorting themselves out in a wash of fear had  no analogue in his new worldview.</p><p>Nabiki  knew now why Ranma was so depressed. Inextricably attached to his  idea of manhood was this necessity to adhere to a sort of chronic  stoicism. Emotion equals bad. And so no parfaits, no crying…no sex.  There was only the Art. Nabiki realized he was going to have to start  training seriously if he was going to survive. As it was, he was  trying not to think of how worthless he felt with a body so out of  shape. He felt this even when he knew the whole idea was complete  baloney. Ranma had actually believed it.</p><p>Now  Ranma, as Ranko, was free, and Nabiki was stuck.</p><p>Inamura  led Nabiki and Ranko into his office. The police department was on  the same block as the hospital so the trip from one to the other was  faster than Nabiki would have liked. "They should be here any  minute," Inamura warned. "Remember. I'm still holding you as a  suspect in Hoko's murder. When the doppelganger comes in, you'll  be exonerated but you'll have to pretend to be friends with it for  who knows how long. Got it?"</p><p>Nabiki  nodded.</p><p>"Okay  then, turn back into a girl and we can get ready." Inamura began  rummaging through his desk for a form.</p><p>"Uh…Detective?"  Nabiki raised a finger.</p><p>"Yeah?"  Inamura said bent over behind the desk.</p><p>"That's  going to be a problem."</p><p>Inamura  stood up. His eyes shifted from Nabiki to Ranko.</p><p>"Sorry,  Inamura-sensei," Ranko bowed, "but Nabiki hasn't figured out  how to change with his mind yet. Do you have any hot or cold water?  That might help."</p><p>Inamura  let out something between a sigh and a grumble. "We don't have  time. We're just going to have to play it by ear."</p><p>"Is  Kawagami-san going to be okay? The doppelganger copied his body last.  He might be in danger."</p><p>"Don't  worry about that," Inamura assured, "There's something special  about officer Kawagami that I'm almost certain the doppelganger  hasn't picked up on."</p><p>"What's  that?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Before  he came here, Hiro used to work homicide at a different precinct. He  was young. The youngest cop working at homicide, but he was good.  Perhaps a little too good…"</p><p>-one  year ago-</p><p>"Fine."  Detective Satou snapped, "Let wonderboy take a look at it. Might as  well offer him my job while you're at it." Satou stormed off hand  in the pockets of his trench coat, his balding head gleaming in the  light from the single dangling incandescent bulb.</p><p>Kawagami  grimaced. It wasn't fair. Satou had been at this for 20 years.  Kawagami had only joined homicide last year. He shouldn't be this  good. He didn't want to be this good. The old apartment complex, a  slum really, was dark even with the bulb. The city was going to tear  it down in a few weeks but the homeless had already found it in the  time since it had been condemned and everywhere were signs of human  life. Spray painted in black on one wall was "The world is dead"  written in Chinese kanji. Kawagami had to remove his sunglasses to  read this. He approached the yellow police tape where forensics  experts were gathering evidence.</p><p>It  was a teenage girl. A high school student. Her uniform in tatters  around her bloody corpse. Her hands had been nailed into the wooden  floorboards. Her feet as well, spread out so that the legs were  almost in splits. This was the position she had been in when the  killer raped her.</p><p>Kawagami  was already about to excuse himself, to leave the room so he could  vomit, but he saw the eyes. Unnaturally wide. The eyelids had been  cut off. They shifted. The eyes shifted, so that they looked straight  at him.</p><p>Suddenly  he was in the ceiling looking down at the man who kidnapped the girl,  brought her here. He wore a black rain slicker, latex gloves used for  washing dishes. black rubber boots.</p><p>Kawagami  could see every act the man performed. He heard every scream. Try as  he might, he could not turn away. Finally he saw the man walk out of  the room. Out of the building. Three blocks away to a dumpster where  he threw away the gloves, the slicker, the boots. The man wore a  business suit underneath. Just your average Japanese salaryman. He  got in his car and drove off. Kawagami memorized the license plate.</p><p>Suddenly  Kawagami was back in his body. Swallowing his gorge, he quietly asked  a member of the forensics team to follow him. He put on his  sunglasses and slowly walked out of the building to the dumpster.  "The killer's rain coat, gloves and boots are in here." He  said.</p><p>"How  do you know that?"</p><p>Kawagami  didn't have an answer for that. Thankfully the garbage truck hadn't  come to the dumpster yet. The perpetrator was caught with the  combination of the raingear with the girl's blood that fit him, the  description that Kawagami gave based on his "analysis of the crime  scene" and eyewitness accounts that put the man and the girl in the  same general location at the right time. It wasn't really enough  for a conviction, but the man confessed. He said he couldn't help  it. That it was something inside him, that he couldn't control. He  was glad he was finally caught so that it would never happen again.</p><p>Kawagami  didn't believe a word of it.</p><p>The  man had approached Kawagami in the hallway of the station supposedly  to thank Kawagami for finding him. Kawagami threw a right cross into  the man's eye.</p><p>Kawagami  asked to be transferred that day.</p><p>-the  present-</p><p>"The  man's eye never healed," Inamura said. "It got worse and worse.  The whole left side of his face rotted and fell off. A few weeks  after Kawagami punched him, the killer was dead."</p><p>"Whoah."  Ranma said, eyes wide, "I mean…Hiro's a good guy…  right?"</p><p>Inamura  nodded. "Officer Kawagami doesn't know it, but he is what we here  in the Nerima precinct call a nekuromansa. An English word meaning  death mage."</p><p>"What  do people outside of the precinct call him?"</p><p>Inamura  took a pull from his cigarette. "An urban legend."</p><p>-nerima  pd-</p><p><i>This  shouldn't be happening</i>, Kawagami Hiro thought, <i>I'm just a  normal guy</i>. <i>A traffic cop, for crying out loud!</i></p><p>-<i>Welcome  to Nerima,-</i> Hoko's voice deadpanned.</p><p>The  precinct was the same as ever. There were cops carrying in suspects,  questioning suspects, rushing from one end of the building to another  to get paperwork sent in, to get coffee. It wasn't all that  different from a business office, except many of the people wore  handcuffs and cursed a lot.</p><p>There  in the back stood Inamura. His arms were crossed. A cigarette butt  hanging out from the fingers of his hand. Next to him stood a  red-headed girl in an orange shirt with the shoulders cut out and  white shorts. Ranma. On the other side, a somewhat gangly young man  with an odd helmet shaped haircut. He wore a black t-shirt and brown  dogi pants. Nabiki?</p><p>-<i>Nabiki's  pretty hot as a guy!- </i>Hoko enthused.</p><p>-<i>I  liked her better as a girl.-</i> Hiro might have been more freaked  out at his love interests sudden sex change, but given his current  predicament he was fresh out of surprise.</p><p><i>-You  would have never had a chance with her. You're too old. She'd use  you for a few free dinners and gifts, but Nabiki likes boys who are  younger than her. 'Naive, yet intelligent, and he has to be cute.'  That's her idea of the perfect man.</i>-</p><p>Manbiki  said something to Inamura. Inamura nodded. Hiro felt a hand grip his  now thin and weak shoulder forcibly. He wondered when exactly he had  lost control over his life. Maybe he had never been in control.</p><p>"Hey,  Inamura!" Copycat pushed Hiro toward the detective, "Look who I  found. Turns out that arm was from some sort of clone that attacked  Tomo-chan here. Really weird stuff."</p><p>"That's  great." Inamura smiled</p><p>-<i>You  know you'll probably never get your body back no matter what  happens, right?- </i>Hoko's voice asked.</p><p>Hiro  nodded.</p><p>"She's  a real hellion, this one," Copycat kept talking, "You know she  knocked me out and tied me up in her closet? Said she thought I was  another clone."</p><p>"That  so?" Inamura raised an eyebrow.</p><p>-<i>You  know he'll kill again if he isn't stopped soon, right?-</i></p><p>Hiro  nodded again.</p><p>"Yeah,  and when I finally convinced her I wasn't, did she go with me  peacefully back to the station? No siree. She wouldn't hear  anything of it. I finally convinced her to come by saying she could  ride her own bike if she wanted."</p><p>Inamura  smirked at Hiro, "I'm sorry you came here under duress. We just  have to confirm you're still alive."</p><p>-<i>Where  do you keep your gun?-</i> Hoko asked.</p><p>Hiro  took a breath. He kept his gun on his belt in a holster. This was  risky.</p><p>He  forced himself to smile with Hoko's unfamiliar facial muscles.  "Rumors of my death were greatly exaggerated."</p><p>-<i>NOW!-</i></p><p>Hiro  turned in a whirl, unsnapped the holster on Copycat's belt, removed  the gun while simultaneously disengaging the safety and blew a round  into Copycat's chest.</p><p>Copycat  fell to the floor. "You bitch!" he screamed, grabbing his shirt  where a red stain was already growing large.</p><p>Someone  kicked the gun out of Hiro's hand. Someone else pulled his arms  behind him, applied handcuffs. Hiro didn't care just then. He was  watching his body die. He would never be his true self again, but at  least he had stopped a serial killer before he could kill again.</p><p>And  then there was a fuzziness around Copycat. He pulled a large blanket  out of thin air and covered himself.</p><p>"Release  her!" Nabiki's male voice cried. "She's not the killer!"</p><p>When  Copycat got up he looked as healthy as ever, and there was another  gun in his holster. "You should have shot me in the head, you dumb  fuck," he said and ran off, knocking down several agitated police  officers along the way to the door.</p><p>"He's  getting away!" Nabiki yelled, "Hurry!"</p><p>Hiro  dimly noted that several people left in a rush. His hands were  released from the handcuffs. Inamura stood in front of him. "You're  too brave for your own damn good, Kawagami. We had the situation  under control, and then you fucked it up."</p><p>"I  didn't know… I thought…"</p><p>"You  didn't think. You acted. If you were still in your old precinct  that would have been fine, but you can't rely on your instincts all  the time out here. Sometimes it's your instincts that'll get you  killed." Inamura took a pull off his cigarette. "Sorry I wasn't  there to give you the speech, but I'll give it to you now. Magic is  real. Especially around here. That doesn't mean everything's  rainbows and unicorns though. What that means is that evil doesn't  always take a human form, and the human forms it does take have to be  dealt with very carefully. Case in point, this doppelganger we're  currently after. There is simply no way we can get this guy through  standard police work. We have to make him think he's getting  exactly what he wants and then spring a trap. Kind of hard to do if  he's on the run, but we'll just have to change our tactics now."</p><p>"I  should have shot him in the head."</p><p>"Yeah.  You should have. Can't change the past though. At least not here.  Have to go through cell block 4 to do that."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Nevermind.  Let's get going," Inamura nodded his head to the side and started  walking.</p><p>"Where…?"</p><p>"To  the morgue. It's about time you found out who you really are."</p><p>-parking  lot-</p><p>Nabiki  ran out of the door into the parking lot. The doppelganger was  leaving on…on Hoko's bike! The bastard! He ran after him, but the  freak was on the road, already out of his grasp. He had to find a  vehicle quick. He looked around. There! A motorcycle. It didn't  look like much but it should do…</p><p>"Nabiki,  think this through, will ya?" Ranko stood in front of him, blocking  his way. "You aren't a martial artist, you'll only get yourself  killed!"</p><p>"Get  out of my way Ranko, we don't have time for this."</p><p>"This  isn't just some random fighter, Fly. This is someone who wants you  dead. Do you hear me? Not beaten up a little, but dead."</p><p>"You're  the one he wants dead, Ran."</p><p>"All  the more reason not to go, because I'm going to go with you if you  do."</p><p>Nabiki  sat on the seat of the bike. "Then get on. We're losing time."</p><p>"This  is crazy!"</p><p>"You  don't understand. I have to do this"</p><p>"Why  don't I understand? Because I'm a girl? You were a girl yourself  just an hour ago. Would you have gone after this guy then? Let me  answer for you. No you wouldn't. You would make a plan first, find  a way to trick him into making a mistake, then truss him up like a  Christmas turkey so the entire community can take turns whacking him  into a bloody pulp."</p><p>"That  was an hour ago, this is now. Get on the bike and shut up."</p><p>Ranko  sat behind Nabiki. "Don't you need a key or something to turn  this on?" she asked.</p><p>Nabiki  stared at the empty ignition. No. There was a time to listen to  reason. This wasn't it. He was not going to be stopped by this. He  was leaving on this bike and there was no way anything was going to  stop him. No fucking way.</p><p>The  engine started.</p><p>Nabiki  pulled out of the parking space and headed toward the street. Stopped  for a moment waiting for traffic, Ranko spoke in his ear. "Nabiki?  Just so you know…you're kind of glowing a little."</p><p>"Hold  on," Nabiki said, and he merged and started to speed up.</p><p>Ranko  held him closely about the waist, and he tried not notice her breasts  against his back, or the way she just sort of <i>fit.</i> He had a  killer to track down and he was determined not to fail in that. At  the same time, he felt this bizarre contentment.</p><p>There  just wasn't anything like facing certain death with your best girl  by your side to make you feel like a man.</p><p>-AUTHOR'S  NOTE-</p><p>5/25/06:</p><p>I  changed a few things based on comments. And I made sure continuity  was preserved. The next chapter should be up now.</p><p>7/21/05</p><p>This  came out a little later than expected, due to some work that came up  but still earlier than I thought at the end of chapter 7. Thanks to  everyone who gave reviews and sent emails</p><p>The  characters have now become hopelessly ooc. But then that's sort of  the point of the fic, so it's not too bad. I should be able to rein  them in some in the next chapter, but for the moment since Ranma and  Nabiki have now changed mental genders as well as physical sex  they're going to act a bit differently.</p><p>STRESS  and nervous TENSION have now become serious problems throughout the  galaxy, and it is order that this situation be in no way exacerbated  that the following facts will be revealed in advance:</p><p>First  Ranma and Nabiki will eventually be returned to the genders of their  birth.</p><p>Second,  Nabiki and Ranma will catch Copycat and fight with him.</p><p>Third,  the fight will result in the exploding of a motorcycle, the bruising  of someone's upper arm, and the spontaneous creation and subsequent  demise of a small, red delicious apple.</p><p>In  order that some mystery be retained, the identity of the person who  sustains the bruise to the upper arm will remain a secret, however  the (relative) safety of our heroes is absolutely assured. (apologies  to the Douglas Adams estate:-))</p><p>Thanks  for reading.</p><p>It  gets weirder.</p>
