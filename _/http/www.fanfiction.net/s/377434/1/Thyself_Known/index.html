</div><p>Thyself  Known</p><p>A Ranma 1/2 fanfic by Zorknot</p><p>Chapter 1: I Must Be Dreaming!</p><p>DISCLAIMER: Characters and some  situations originally concieved by Rumiko Takahashi.</p><p><i>    "It's like a dream you try to remember, but it's gone,<br/>Then you try to scream, but it only comes out as a yawn<br/>When you try to see the world beyond your front door.<br/>Take your time, 'cause theway I rhyme's gonna make you smile<br/>When you realize a guy my size might take a while<br/>Just to try and figure out what all this is for.<br/>Pinch me, pinch me 'cause I'm still asleep<br/>Please, God, tell me that I'm still asleep."<br/></i></p><p>Fr. "Pinch Me" by  Steven Page and Ed Robertson of Barenaked Ladies</p><p>~~~~~[BEGIN]~~~~~</p><p><i>Ranma is in a maze, a dark labyrinth of false hallways and  dead ends, of hidden traps and all too visible obstructions, of pain,  frustration, and misery.</i><i> He comes to an intersection in the  hallway. He turns left. "RANMA NO BAKA!" he hears as Akane hits him  with a hammer. Through the stars in his eyes, he sees her turn away saying  "How could I love such an arrogant, self-centered, perverted, JERK!"  the words stab like hot knives. Though he's heard them before, now they are  spoken without the tinge of playfulness Akane with which she usually says. And  then there is that word. Love. </i>How could Akane ever love me?<i> Ranma despairs. He collapses onto his knees  as he hears a familiar battle cry:</i></p><p><i>    "PREPARE TO DIE,  RANMA!" Ranma dodges Ryoga's attacks easily and  manages to stay away from the debris from his Bakuzai  Tenketsu. Seeing an opening, Ranma starts his  modified Tenshin Amaguriken, punching the same spot  on Ryoga's chest repeatedly and with nigh inhuman  speed, when he notices that Ryoga isn't trying to block. And he has a sad look  on his face. Ranma stops and stares as Ryoga speaks, "You put me through  hell, and now you're doing the same to Akane. I may not be able to beat you  Ranma, but I can't let you hurt her anymore. She's too good for you."</i></p><p><i> "Oh like you're any better? Snugglin' up to her every night as P-Chan? The only time  she can stand you is when you're a pig. Heck you almost killed her when you  found that waterproof soap and finally got her on a date!" The words pour  out of him in a wash of anger.</i></p><p><i> "At least I never hurt her feelings. And  you know I've been trying to find a way to stop being a pig for a long time  now. I thought you would realize that, but I guess... you were never much of a  friend either..." Ryoga turns and walks away as Ranma stands stunned.</i></p><p><i> He tries to run after Ryoga, but he finds he  can't move. He briefly wonders why, then he hears it... the laugh. "WAAAAHahahahahahahahahahahaha!"  It's Kodachi. She bounds into view, wearing her green  leotard and waving her ribbon around as she speaks. "Hello my darling, I'm  glad you are no longer resisting me," she plants a long, wet kiss on  Ranma's unresponsive lips, "now we shall be wed in perfect bliss! We just  have to deal with that peasant Akane and her insipid family!" Kodachi embraces him in a manner that might be called  loving by a casual observer but would seem upon closer inspection perversely  voracious. It's as if Kodachi wants to eat him rather  than marry him. When Kodachi mentions Akane and her  family they appear, all of them sad... but Akane especially. Kodachi then proceeds to lop off the head of Soun Tendo  with her ribbon laughing maniacally. </i>NO!<i> Next comes Nabiki, her face stuck in a scowl of disapproval as  her head flies off her shoulders almost comically. </i>NOOOOO!<i> Next would be Kasumi. Gentle  Kasumi. Kasumi who even when possessed by evil could never really bring  herself to harm anyone.</i></p><p><i> Ranma can't take it, somehow managing to  speak he yells, "Kodachi you BITCH! When I  recover, I don't care if you ARE a girl, I WILL KILL YOU!"</i></p><p><i> "Oh but my darling, you won't ever  recover! You and I will be together forever and ever and ever! Oh I forgot Ahahaha! I need to get my wedding dress! WAAAAHahahahahahahahaha!" and she bounds off into the  darkness leaving a cloud of black rose petals and Akane looking hurt and  dejected.</i></p><p><i> "Akane you gotta  understand! She drugged me! I can't move! I only just have been able to  talk!" Akane just stands there with tears in her eyes. Tatewaki  Kuno appears with his bokken carried casually on his shoulder.</i></p><p><i> "Greetings, fiend.  Usually I disapprove of my dear sister's multitudinous and oft fervent methods  to wed the foul creature that is you, but my sibling of the fairer sex will  find that I am in complete agreement with this most recent technique. Foul  sorcerer that you are, you have imprisoned many to your whim not the least of  which the fair tigress Akane and the fiery pig-tailed girl. How fitting then,  that you find yourself imprisoned in much the same way by one who you had  thought to ensnare."</i></p><p><i> "Shut up, Kuno! I ain't  ensnarin' nobody 'specially  not that BITCH sister of yours Kodachi!"</i></p><p><i> "Ah but you are. You cause women to love  you like moths love the flame, and your indecision doth make the flame grow  hotter causing pain and brighter causing moths to gather closer. Yet each moth  is in truth a spectacular butterfly that wants but to drink from what it  believes to be a flowery vessel of the sweetest nectar. Only I know that the  nectar they seek is poison and your bloom is like onto that thorny variety of  Plutonian flower my sister implements as her namesake." Kuno's words are still characteristically pompous but now  they seem to convey something. Something that Ranma is afraid... might be true.</i></p><p><i> Before Ranma can come up with a suitable  rebuke, Kuno fades away to be replaced by Shampoo, jumping off her bicycle and  yelling "Airen!" in mid-glomp. "Is true! Ranma no can move. Shampoo marry  Ranma for sure!"</i></p><p><i> "Aw, get offa  me, Shampoo!" Ranma tries desperately to struggle but, well, he can't  move. Shampoo just hugs tighter and tighter until she almost suffocates him and  finally, when it seems like he is about to pass out, she is gone, replaced by  her great-grandmother, </i><i>Cologne</i><i>.  Not an improvement as far as Ranma can see.</i></p><p><i> "Hello, Son-in-law. I hope you're  comfortable, seeing as you aren't going to move anytime soon. I have the  antidote, but I'm not going to give it to you until you make a certain promise.  I'm sure you know what that is."</i></p><p><i> "NO! I ain't gonna marry Shampoo. I don't care how many years of Amazon  history are at stake!"</i></p><p><i> "Pity" </i><i>Cologne</i><i>  says as she hops away on her wooden staff.</i></p><p><i> Akane is still there looking angry through  her tears. "Please, Akane, understand! I can' t  help it! I just don't wanna hurt their feelin's!" </i>That's odd<i>, thinks Ranma.  He had meant to say something about being paralyzed, but instead THAT came out.  </i>What's going on...?</p><p><i> A worried-looking Ukyo runs up to Ranma. "Ucchan! Finally  someone who I can trust!"</i></p><p><i> "Hey Ranchan! Guess what!"</i></p><p><i> "What?"</i></p><p><i> " I was able to  get that antidote from </i><i>Cologne</i><i>!"</i></p><p><i> "That's fantastic, Ucchan!  Now I can move again! You're such a good friend!"</i></p><p><i> "Just one  moment." Ukyo Kuonji pauses with the  antidote in her hand "Before I -give this to you I want ask you one  thing"</i></p><p><i> "What's that?"</i></p><p><i> "Do you love Akane?"</i></p><p><i> Ranma doesn't know what to do. There's Akane,  with tears in her eyes, who will either explode... or  merely break apart if he says no. Then there's Ukyo who was always his friend  ...or so he thought, but he can see in her eyes that she wants more, and she  will be similarly affected if he says yes. </i>I can't decide I CAN'T DECIDE! Why can't people just leave  me alone! <i>He closes his eyes tight in  frustration as voices from the past echo his feelings "Akane or the  pig-tailed girl, the pig-tailed girl or Akane!" "Should  I tell Akane about being P-Chan or not? If I tell her she'll hate me if  I don't she'll never love me as a man!" "Which one should I wear the  red dress or the blue? What do you think, Ranma, the blue dress or the  red?" Ranma opens his eyes to find his father standing with a bucket.</i></p><p><i> "Make a decision, boy. You are acting  like A GIRL!" he splashes Ranma with the contents of the bucket breaking  a now female Ranma from paralysis. Onna-Ranma stretches for a moment glad to  finally be able to move. Suddenly, she's surrounded by cats! They get closer  and closer, and they all seem to yowl "Airen" or "Darling" or "Ranchan" or even "Baka."</i></p><p><i> "Oh no not c- c- c-  CATS!" Onna-Ranma turns and runs at full speed away from the furry  creatures, entering the right side of the intersection. Suddenly, the cats are  gone and there's a curious silence. </i>What the hell's going on here? One second I'm running for my  life and the next...nothing.<i> Then in the darkness, three words are heard  in a sickeningly familiar voice. "Suki  da. I love you," it's Kuno. Then he  appears...and he appears again, and again... like an image from another dream  Ranma had when Kuno had first met his "pig-tailed goddess." The  images grasp hands and circle around Ranma's head chanting, "I love you I  would date with you I love you I would date with you IloveyouIwoulddatewithyou..."</i></p><p><i> "Arrrrgggghhh  I'm A GUY" Yells Ranma</i></p><p><i> Then Mikado Senzenin  of the Golden pair glides out of the darkness "You shall be my thousandth  conquest!" he says as he puckers his lips.</i></p><p><i> "Get away from me, you pervert, I'm a  MAN"</i></p><p><i> Nodoka appears and smiles proudly  "You'll make a good wife someday, Ranko"</i></p><p><i> "But MOM! I'm ain't a girl!"</i></p><p><i> "Why would you say a thing like that?  Really, Ranko, such words are not becoming of a  lady"</i></p><p><i> "That's what I'm trying to tell you I'm  a MAN I'm your SON"</i></p><p><i> The Kunos break  from their chant to say in unison "Methinks the lady doth protest too  much"</i></p><p><i> "What the hell is THAT supposed to mean!  And who're you callin' a lady?"</i></p><p><i> "It means," says Ryoga appearing  out of the darkness with a smirk "that if you were really so sure that you  were a man you wouldn't bother saying it so much."</i></p><p><i> "Shut up P-CHAN!"</i></p><p><i> "Oooh looks  like I hit a nerve! Could it be true? Could it be that Saotome Ranma the 'man  among men' actually LIKES being a girl?" Ryoga seems to be enjoying this  immensely.</i></p><p><i> "That's not true and you know it,  Ryoga!"</i></p><p><i> "If you like being a girl so much, why  don't you just STAY that way!" It's Akane, a  voice from the past, from a time when Ranma had almost considered that very  thing. Ranma was pretty much frightened off the idea when his two halves were  separated and his female half turned out to be an evil, soul-sucking demon.  Still, it revealed in a moment the falsehood of Ranma's statement.</i></p><p>That reminds me, why isn't Happosai here?<i> Onna-Ranma has only a moment to wonder why it is that Happosai SHOULD  be here before her father's master glomps her.</i></p><p><i> "Oh, Ranma! I'm  so glad! NOW will you wear this little number?" the demon midget said  managing to pull out a silk teddy while squeezing Onna-Ranma's breasts at the  same time.</i></p><p><i> "No... I ... will... not... you...  PERVERT!" yells Ranma as she dropkicks the master into oblivion. Ranma  always felt... weird whenever the old lech did that. </i>I gotta find  some hot water<i>!  And there it is right in the middle of the  intersection in the form of a piping teakettle. Ranma lunges for it and pours  the rather painful contents on her head turning her back to a man. </i>Well  only one more direction to go...<i> Thinks Ranma, newly male, as he walks down the middle corridor.</i></p><p><i> He wonders briefly at how odd everything  seems: people appearing out of nowhere, not being able  to move, cats talking. There was something that all this meant if he could just  figure it out. </i>Wait,  it has something to do with what you say when nothing seems to make any sense.  What is that?</p><p><i> Now he realizes he is approaching a gigantic  mirror. The figure in the mirror becomes more discernable until he finds that  it is himself, or rather, his female self.</i></p><p>Oh now I remember!<i>  "I must be dreaming!" That doesn't  seem to do anything.</i></p><p>Wait there's something else I'm supposed to do, something stupid  involving pain... ohhhhh!<i>  Before Ranma can pinch himself  he pauses as he sees his female self raise her arm, pointing straight at him.  The female Ranma speaks accusingly, confusingly, angrily. She says, " WHO ARE YOU?" Otoko-Ranma  remains silent. "WHO ARE YOU!" Onna-Ranma  demands. Then Otoko-Ranma remembers and pinches  himself. Of course he feels nothing because he is dreaming.</i></p><p><i>"I  AM dreaming!"</i>  Ranma <i>says</i>  as <i>reality</i>  starts <i>making</i> itself appar<i>ent </i>once <i>a</i>gain.</p><p>Ranma woke up with a start. <i>What a weird dream!</i> , he thought. He tried to keep the events of the  dream in his mind. Ranma had a feeling that the dream was important somehow,  that it revealed some inner truth about him and perhaps foreshadowed some event  to come...</p><p>He sat for a  moment on his futon thinking about it. He'd never remembered the pinching thing  working before. He shrugged. <i>I guess  there's something to it after all</i>. Ranma had always thought the idea of  pinching yourself to find out if you were dreaming was pretty stupid. Couldn't  you just dream there was pain after you pinched? And what if you dreamt you  were a butterfly or something, like that monk in the old scroll Pops stole from  that temple in China? How would you pinch yourself then? Yet  it had worked. Weird.</p><p><i>Hmmm...</i><i> Now what was the dream about? Something  important... revealing some inner truth...</i> Ranma couldn't remember a single  thing about the dream. Well, aside from the pinching. <i>Now why would that be important?</i></p><p>He noticed it  was still dark and the large furry creature he knew as his father was still  snoring beside him. He had woken up early. "I must be dreaming!" he  said as he pinched himself. This time nothing happened.</p><p>Ranma was not  the least bit tired, and he knew without trying that he wouldn't be able to get  back to sleep. He glared enviously at the soundly sleeping panda and got to his  feet, grimacing as the aches and pains from the previous day's battles made  themselves known once again. He stretched a bit,  working out the little bit of stiffness in his joints, before he got dressed  and went downstairs.</p><p>There he  found an extremely exhausted Kasumi trying desperately to wake up with a cup of  tea. "Oh hello Ranma!" she said as cheerfully as she could manage  while yawning.</p><p>"Morning, Kasumi! Jeez, you look tired! How'd your date go with Dr.  Tofu?"</p><p>Kasumi  laughed in spite of her self. It had been an experience. The poor dear was so  nervous he almost couldn't walk. He had very nearly taken Betty the skeleton  out instead of her! Then... then they had kissed. After that she was the  nervous one! They laughed and talked all night. They shared stories about Ranma  and his friends and some of the other things they had been through. Then she  asked him what finally caused him to ask her out. And he said he had been  wondering the same thing about her. They each took out the notes they  received... They were both truly excellent forgeries. Nabiki really had a  talent. <i>Oh what a loving family I have! </i>Thought  Kasumi as she remembered, <i>if only I  wasn't so tired so I could fix a decent breakfast for them!</i>  "It was wonderful, Ranma, thanks for  asking," She said out loud, smiling as she mumbled through the words.</p><p>"What  time did'ya get in last  night?"</p><p>"Oh  about three hours ago," Kasumi responded drowsily. "Oh  my! I really must get started on breakfast..." she seemed to lose  consciousness for a second, "So I can... finish before the others come  down." She swayed a bit as she struggled to get up from her sitting  position.</p><p>"Um... Kasumi?"</p><p>"Yes  Ranma?"</p><p>"How  about... how about I cook breakfast for a change? That way you can get some  rest."</p><p>"Y-you  would do that?" Kasumi was surprised even through her stupor. She knew  that Ranma could do it. Whenever he had cooked she had found that he had talent  that rivaled even her own, although she would always be more experienced. The  thing was, he usually only cooked when his mother was around and he was  pretending to be Ranko. The only other time he had  ever asked to cook was when he got that nasty knock on his head and thought he  was a girl. He had always claimed it was "women's work." "Is  something wrong?" Kasumi asked worriedly. She didn't think she could deal  with anything that unusual today.</p><p>"No, no  I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm not about to start actin'  like a girl or nothin'... it's just, well, you look  so tired I'm afraid you wouldn't be much better than Akane in the kitchen, and  I'm not about to ask HER to cook so...Just don't tell nobody okay?"</p><p>"Okay," Kasumi mumbled as she staggered off to bed. She reflected on  how nice Ranma was being. It was a side she wished he would show more often.  Maybe then he and her sister would get along better. She really needed some  sleep. It was so nice of Ranma to notice how tired she was. What she hoped he  didn't notice was that she was quite a bit hung over too.</p><p>She passed Nabiki  in the hall, but was too tired to say anything. <i>I'll have to make sure to thank her later.</i>  As she entered her room and climbed into bed  she was barely aware of something being wrong. That there was something she was  supposed to do. She might have realized what it was if she wasn't so worn out.  Instead she yawned through another "Oh my!" and fell asleep almost  before her head hit the pillow. She didn't wake up for another four hours.</p><p>Nabiki had, despite all attempts to stay asleep, gotten up  early. As she entered the hallway and walked toward the washroom Nabiki passed  Kasumi in the hall, but it was obvious she was too tired to say anything. <i>I'll have to ask her how her date went  later.</i> Kasumi was evidently going back to bed. Nabiki smiled, She was  probably too worn out from her date to stay up. Nabiki entered the washroom,  answered a pressing call of nature, and splashed some water on her face to  dispel the tendrils of sleep that had formed on her eyes from a night of  wondering how her sister's date was going. Suddenly, a horrible, terrifying,  and all around unpleasant question came to her mind: If Kasumi is going back to  sleep... then WHO'S COOKING BREAKFAST?</p><p>She jerked  her head up with a start, completely awake now. She had to know whether to call  a restaurant, or the paramedics. If no one was cooking, she knew a restaurant  that would deliver. It was expensive but worth it. Just as  long as Akane didn't cook. If Akane was cooking, and that was entirely  possible she suddenly realized, then doom awaited everyone at the Tendo dojo!</p><p>Nabiki  sprinted quickly toward her room, careful not to make too much noise and  disturb Kasumi (although she really didn't need to worry, Kasumi was out cold).  Kasumi had always taken care of the culinary needs of the Tendo home without  complaint. She deserved her rest this morning. Nabiki now had a mission: to  make sure breakfast was served and that it was edible.</p><p>First,  though, she had to see what exactly the situation was in the kitchen. If Akane were  cooking, she'd be extremely angry if Nabiki went ahead and ordered out. It  would take several minutes of reasoning with the unreasonable before she would  get Akane to relent. Unfortunately the kitchen was definitely NOT a safe place  to be when Akane cooked. If she wanted to talk to Akane unscathed she had to  know in which direction the knives were flying. Luckily, in the year or so  since the Saotomes' arrival, Nabiki had amassed enough money from Ranma's  frequent misadventures to pay for a highly advanced, nearly undetectable  security system. A security system that could be monitored  more or less completely from a small space inside Nabiki's closet. She  went there now and turned on the laptop that showed the images from all the  security cameras in the house.</p><p>The camera in the kitchen was angled so  that a viewer wouldn't be able to see what was being cooked but could still  tell what was going on. Nabiki didn't want anybody stealing Kasumi's recipes,  but with the frequent appearances of Nodoka, the kitchen was one of the prime  spots for action now. She didn't really intend to sell the rather embarrassing  tapes of Ranma as Ranko, but she figured that if she  really needed Ranma to do something... well Nabiki was never above a little  blackmail to get what she wanted. She keyed up the window for the  kitchen...Ranma was cooking! She watched as he picked up a bunch of pots and  pans that had fallen and put them back in place. And then...Nabiki barely  managed to keep her jaw from hitting the keyboard.</p><p>Ranma was a little too busy to realize her mistake. She had  since changed to girl form because she found it easier to cook that way. Otoko-Ranma's longer limbs, while an asset in battle,  proved to cause some clumsiness in the kitchen where Ranma was more used to the  female form.</p><p>Ranma was  just about done with the spinach and rice and was ready to start on the soup,  when Nabiki entered the kitchen with a very surprised look on her face... that  couldn't completely hide the smirk. <i>Ranma's  going to be willing to do anything to keep this under wraps! </i></p><p>Ranma stood,  frozen, her eyes wide, looking more than a little like a deer suddenly  realizing that it just walked out onto a major highway. Then she sighed  remembering Kasumi. "Nabiki, before you get any ideas, I'm doin' this for Kasumi. You didn't see how tired she was.  She could barely sit up straight! There was no way I was going to let her cook  in that condition." Nabiki stared at Ranma. That last part sounded an  awful lot like Nodoka. Ranma noticed too: "I mean,  it ain't like she's gotten any breaks or nothin'" she recovered. There was a long pause filled  with Nabiki's shocked stare "Well, if you are not going to say anything, I  have got to get back to the grill or the rice will get burned."</p><p>Nabiki  squinted. She was reverting to Ranko. Nodoka was just  too strict a teacher. As Onna-Ranma set about preparing the rest of breakfast  she looked like any other girl. "Hey Ranko!"  Nabiki called.</p><p>Onna-Ranma  turned and said with a look of mild annoyance "What is it, Nabiki, I am trying to work here." Then her eyes went  wide. "Wait a minute- did you just call me-? Hey that don't mean nothin' It's just that I'm used to bein'  Ranko when I'm cooking and..." she turned around  and stirred the rice for a moment, as her aura suddenly grew very cold. <i>I don't need to explain anything to her.  She's part of the problem. What she says doesn't matter,  I need to keep the others from knowing otherwise I might not be able to keep up  the soul of ice</i> "How much" she said quietly.</p><p>"Hmm?" Nabiki knew perfectly well what Ranma  meant, but she wanted a clarification.</p><p>"If Pops  finds out about this, I'm dead. If anyone from school finds out about it, I'm  REALLY dead, and if Akane finds out I did this 'cause her cooking is so  terrible, she'll probably make me wish I were dead. So what do I have to do to  keep you from tellin' everybody about it." Ranma took the rice off the element and started  heating the water for the soup.</p><p>"About what exactly?"</p><p><i>Dammit</i><i> she's so annoying! Calm down. Why is she  annoying? She is asking about the obvious. Why would she do that? It makes no  sense... unless it isn't that obvious. She heard what I said... so there must  be something else. She wants to know what she can get away with.,</i> Ranma had mastered the soul of  ice with great difficulty. It was hard to not care about... certain things.  Once she had learned it, though it proved invaluable. Especially  when Mom showed up. The increased ability to think logically was an  added bonus. "About the cooking, and the Ranko thing..." Ranma said, responding to Nabiki's  question ", but you know something else... don't you." Ranma turned  around as she said this. She had a minute or so before she had to put  ingredients in. She walked to Nabiki, who was still in the doorway, and noted  the raised eyebrows "You do know something else!"</p><p><i>Damn,</i> thought Nabiki, recognizing  Ranma's "soul of ice" mode, <i>ever  since he learned that Hiryu Shotan  Ha thing, he's been getting less and less gullible.</i>  "Yes," she said flatly, "It's  not like you could keep it a secret for long, not in this house."</p><p>"Keep  what a secret?" Ranma demanded. Before Nabiki could answer, they were  interrupted by a voice from the stairs.</p><p>"Morning Kasumi! I'm up a little early so I thought I'd-  Nabiki? RANMA?" If someone had asked Akane which  two people she would guess least likely to be standing in the kitchen doorway  this early in the morning, she would have repeated those very names.</p><p>Ranma  grimaced, then spoke softly to Nabiki so Akane  wouldn't hear: "She will probably figure it out anyway so tell her  whatever you want, but in any case, if you want to have something other than  toxic waste for breakfast you had better keep her out of the kitchen." She  went back to the stove and started adding ingredients to the Miso soup, leaving Nabiki to fend for herself.</p><p>"What's  going on here? Where's Kasumi? Is Ranma COOKING? Who are you, and what have you  done with my sister?" Akane was only half joking.</p><p>"Calm  down, Akane-chan, the pod people haven't gotten to me YET. As  for Ranma... I'm not so sure. From what I gather, he evidently got up  early this morning for some reason and he and Kasumi talked for a bit. Well  Ranma noticed how tired Kasumi was so he... offered to cook breakfast."  Spoken out loud, the idea of Ranma offering to cook seemed even more  ridiculous. Nabiki paused for a moment, wondering again at Ranma's actions, then continued. "I saw Kasumi go back to bed and I came  down here to... find out what was going on. What I found was Ranma, cooking  away like he was raised in a kitchen. He even answered to Ranko  once and spoke proper Japanese. Auntie Saotome must really have him  whipped."</p><p>"That's  weird! But... why are you telling me all this?"</p><p>"Because, little sister, having a secret's no fun unless you  tell it, and Ranma and I were about to make a deal to turn all this information  classified when you came down the stairs."</p><p>"Humph,  okay. Well I guess I'll see if I can help with anything..."Akane started  to enter the kitchen, but Nabiki hurriedly pulled her back.</p><p>"Eh... no."</p><p>"What's  wrong, Nabiki?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I don't  think it's a good idea for you to go in there right now," Nabiki said  carefully.</p><p>"Why not?" Akane asked defensively.</p><p>"Don't...make me answer that." The two sisters glared at each other  for a moment. Akane knew why she wasn't being let into the kitchen. She was  quite aware that her cooking was ...bad, but she felt she had to keep trying.  Nabiki, on the other hand, understood Akane's wish to be a better cook, but  wasn't too keen on the possibility of dying from one of Akane's creations. This  formed a powder keg that would have ignited between them long ago if it hadn't  been for-</p><p>"That  absolute, no good, dirty, rotten, perverted, JERK!" Akane was almost  screaming. "I'm going to make him wish he was dead!"(Enter  recognition of irony here) Nabiki saw the hammer starting to materialize in  Akane's right hand as she once again headed into the kitchen.</p><p>"Whoa,  back off there, sunshine. He's almost done and there's one other thing I've got  to tell you about."</p><p>"What's  that?" Akane paused, and her half-materialized hammer winked out once  again into nonexistence.</p><p>"Okay I  was watching Ranma in the kitchen and-"</p><p>"Excuse  me. Since everybody is going to wake up now, we might as well go over the story  we are going to tell our fathers" Onna-Ranma was back where Nabiki and  Akane were standing having left the fish to cook for a while.</p><p>Akane stared  at Ranma for a moment: <i>He really is  acting weird!</i> However Ranma was acting, though, Akane was still Akane:  "What do you mean 'everybody is going to wake up'?"</p><p>Onna-Ranma  just looked at her, eyes level with Akane's, until Nabiki pointed out,  "Well you've got to admit, sis, you WERE pretty loud when you were  screaming bloody murder just now."</p><p>"Right." Onna-Ranma said, breaking her staring  contest with Akane, her aura warming somewhat. "Now, Pops can't know I've  been cookin' or he'll go ballistic. So what I'm gonna tell him is that I came down here when Kasumi was  just about finished and-"</p><p>"Uh...  Ranma" Akane interrupted, pointing over Onna-Ranma's left shoulder.</p><p>"What!" She was a little annoyed at being stopped in the middle of explaining  what she had thought to be a pretty good plan... and then she turned around.</p><p>If there was one thing Happosai had taught Genma well, it  was stealth. He had managed to sneak past Nabiki and Akane with ease and almost  went undetected, but all the stealth in the world won't make up for stupidity.  When his son started talking he crept round the corner, now in full view to see  what was going on <i>Fade into the woodwork,  that's the ticket! </i>Akane of course had no trouble seeing a full-grown panda  regardless of how much said panda was trying to look inconspicuous.</p><p>Onna-Ranma  saw her father. It was all over. "Ohhhh... uh...  Hi!... er... Oh!... Ohayo  Pops! Gotta get going... the soup..." she  trailed off as she ran into the kitchen to check on the soup. So much for the soul of ice. It had pretty much fizzled out  at that point. Nabiki was right: you couldn't really keep a secret long in the  Tendo Dojo. Even, as Ranma would soon find out, secrets you didn't know you  had...</p><p>Genma, being  unable to talk, was silent as Nabiki explained what Ranma had done, leaving out  the Ranko business and the part that Ranma and Akane  evidently didn't know yet. After hearing it, Genma was still a little worried,  but he was also...proud.</p><p>After a while  Nabiki walked in the kitchen and noticed the teakettle full of water being  heated on the stove. It was time to find out for sure if Ranma knew or not.</p><p>"What's  that for?" Nabiki asked innocently pointing to the kettle. Ranma gave her  a quizzical look. "It heats water, you know, like for tea and changin' back into a guy and so on. Did Akane throw you  into the koi pond or somethin'?"  Getting thrown into the koi pond had become the  favored explanation for odd behavior in the Tendo home, and Nabiki not knowing  something that Ranma did would certainly be considered odd.</p><p>He doesn't  know... or maybe..."So you can only do it one way?"</p><p>"Do  what? Nabiki, you ain't makin'  any sense!" Onna-Ranma gingerly felt the side of the kettle, decided it  was warm enough, and raised it into position.</p><p>"You're  not telling me something," Nabiki accused.</p><p>"I don't  know what you're talkin' about," Ranma said as  he poured the kettle's contents onto his head.</p><p>Nabiki  stared. It was true, he wasn't telling her something, but the reason he wasn't  telling her was that he didn't know about it himself. Not only does he not  know, He's completely oblivious! "Ranma baby, after school I'm going  to show you something, and you're going to want to bring cash."</p><p>Ranma grew  pale. He knew from experience it would be in his best interests to follow  Nabiki's "advice". "Sure thing, that is, if Pops hasn't disowned  me by then."</p><p>A paw grabbed  Ranma's shoulder. He absently handed the teakettle to his father who promptly  emptied it on his head. "Don't worry, son, I won't disown you." Genma  had caught the tail end of the conversation once again, but for once, he was  right on time.</p><p>Ranma was  shocked. That statement was the closest his father had ever come to saying that  he loved him. It was even better than ten years ago, when he had said,  "Maybe you're not so pathetic!" "But...but cooking... it's  women's work and I have to be a man among men and..."</p><p>"Cooking  is a very useful skill on the field, boy, As long as it doesn't interfere with  your martial arts... I see nothing... wrong with it. In fact, once you and  Akane are married, knowing how to cook may mean the difference between life and  death..." Ranma glanced around when his father made that remark, but Akane  was gone. <i>Damn! She's never around when  someone else makes a mistake!</i></p><p>"No," Genma continued, further cheered that Ranma hadn't reacted to  the marriage reference "I'm not going to disown you. I'm proud of you boy.  This morning you fulfilled a debt of honor. That girl Kasumi has helped the  Tendos and us without any thanks. Helping her out if anything proves that you  are a man among men and I think your mother would agree with me on this."</p><p>Ranma could  barely contain himself "You mean I can see my mother... as a guy?"</p><p>"No,"  Genma shook his head sadly, "She wouldn't understand your curse, but if she  could, I'm sure she'd agree."</p><p>Ranma  deflated a little at that. "But... I can cook... whenever I want to?"</p><p>"As long as it doesn't interfere with your martial arts  training...yes." Ranma couldn't remember a time when he had been  happier. Ranma had secretly felt that the only thing he was any good at aside  from martial arts was cooking, and now he could do both with his father's  approval! Ranma had always worked for his father's approval, and even after all  Genma put him through it still meant a lot. A huge smile broke out on his face  and he yelled out the first thing that came to his mind: "Yaa paa paa!"</p><p>Akane turned to her older sister as she walked out to begin  her morning jog: "What does that mean?"</p><p>Nabiki  shrugged: "Beats me." Akane stood in the doorway looking thoughtful  for a moment before she left. "Hey, wait a minute don't you want to know..."  Akane was gone. <i>Oh well,</i> Nabiki  thought <i>No one's paid me yet. Might as well keep this a secret for a while.</i></p><p>"Prepare yourself, boy! You must continue your  training!" Genma, resplendent in his white gi  took his stance beside the koi pond.</p><p>Ranma had  stopped wearing a gi during his workouts a while  back. Most of the time, he wore his black Chinese pants and a tank top. He was  usually late for school, and it was quicker to just put the over shirt on  rather than change out of a gi. He kicked his father  into the pond. "Hey I'm all for training, Pops but couldn't we do this  later? I mean what if Akane walks into the kitchen while I'm not there?"</p><p>The panda  walked out of the pond holding a sign "The life of a martial artist is fraught  with perils," it said. With that, Genma leapt toward Ranma and the two  exchanged a flurry of kicks and punches.</p><p>Some time  later Akane came back from her jog. "Hey Ranma!  You busy? I'll check the soup for you!" She ran into the house.</p><p>A young man and  a panda paused in their sparring and looked at each other. Then they looked at  the shorthaired girl entering the house. The panda lifted a sign: "Go, son,  before it's too late!"</p><p>Ranma ran  into the house. Luckily Nabiki was still running interference. "Hey look  at this, Akane-chan," Nabiki was saying to her sister as Ranma came into  the room. She was pointing to a finance magazine she had been reading. "It  looks like stock in United Concrete Inc. has gone up since last month. You think  you might have anything to with that?"</p><p>"Very funny, Nabiki. Oh hello Ranma you're done  sparring already?"</p><p>"Er.. yeah." Behind Akane, Nabiki  was making circular motions and mouthing something... sa..ra? <i>Huh? Dishes? Ohhhhh!</i> "Hey Akane! Why don't you set the table while I get  everything ready and heat some water up for Pops."</p><p>"Okay!" <i>Ranma ASKED me to help!  Wait a minute... he probably just didn't want me in the kitchen that JERK!</i>  Grimacing now, Akane started preparing the table. "Well, I guess Daddy  didn't wake up after all!" she said to Nabiki in an attempt to gain some  satisfaction from Ranma being wrong.</p><p>"Oh he  came down. He went off to the dojo to meditate." Nabiki stated  matter-of-factly as she put her magazine away and started helping Akane out of  sheer boredom.</p><p>"You  don't think it's because of-"</p><p>"When is  it not?" the mood was suddenly serious. A moment passed, then a large panda walked in the room and headed toward the  kitchen. If you've seen a panda then you know that despite being very large,  they don't seem very threatening. They look like gigantic black and white teddy  bears. With silly little tails.</p><p>Akane started  laughing, and Nabiki followed. "What's so funny?" the panda signed. The girls  laughed even harder. Genma growfed grumpily and went  into the kitchen.</p><p>Nabiki  suddenly stopped, her smile sad now. "You know,  there won't always be a panda to lighten the mood."</p><p>"Oh,  Nabiki, you're no fun" Akane said brightly as she put the last plate on  the table.</p><p>"Me? I'm  loads of fun!" Nabiki countered pulling a camera from beside her and  snapping a picture of Akane's smile, "I'm having fun right now!"</p><p>"Gimme that!" Akane said as she snatched the camera out  of Nabiki's hands and took a few of Nabiki. They were both laughing when their  father walked in. "Morning! How are you feeling?" Akane greeted him.</p><p>Soun Tendo  loved his daughters very much. His face was filled with a warm, loving smile as  he looked at his youngest daughter, always ready to fight for those she cared  about. He held that smile as he gazed proudly at his second youngest daughter,  who would someday be a successful businesswoman. His face went slack and his  mouth became a tight straight line when he realized his eldest daughter was  missing. "Where's Kasumi," he demanded.</p><p>"Relax,  Daddy. She went back to sleep. She had a LONG night last night" Nabiki  explained with a smile.</p><p>Mr. Tendo was  visibly relieved. "Oh yes... her...date." This brought on some Tendo  waterworks: "My daughters are growing up!" Then he stopped suddenly.  He looked at the food on the table. He managed not to look at Akane. "Heh heh heh so... who cooked?"  He tried to sound as innocent as possible.</p><p>"I  did!" exclaimed Ranma, entering from the kitchen followed by his father.</p><p>"Ranma? You cooked?"</p><p>"Yep yep yeppity  yep yep yep! It was  me. I made breakfast. Hope you like it."</p><p>Soun looked  confused for just a moment, then relaxed. He had seen too many strange things  in his life to be troubled too much by such a relatively small thing as...Ranma  is cooking! He looked confused again. <i>Well,  I guess the food will be edible enough.</i>   "Very well then... let's eat."</p><p>With that the  Tendos and the Saotomes ate, and for a moment things seemed almost normal. Almost. There were two remarkable differences. First, Kasumi  was not there. She was missed. Not just because everyone was curious as to how  her evening with Dr. Tofu had gone either. The breakfast table was often used  as a place to discuss problems, and Kasumi had always found a way to put them in  a better light. Ranma might be complaining about Ryoga trying to fight him all  the time and she would say something like "Oh sometimes friends just  disagree" and the situation wouldn't seem nearly as bad. It was the same  with every other problem the Tendos or Saotomes had. Even if Kasumi's comments  were unrealistically optimistic, more often then not, they helped whoever was  having the problem immensely. Without her there, breakfast was uncomfortably  quiet.</p><p>The other  difference was that it was Ranma's food they were eating. Ranma had cooked  before, but always with Nodoka or Kasumi's help. Ranma cooked this without any  assistance, and with each bite everyone was more surprised at how good it was.</p><p>"Got to  admit, Ranma..." Nabiki paused as she chewed her food, "This isn't  half bad"...<i>and I didn't have to  spend 30,000 yen on delivery! </i></p><p>"Thanks,  Nabiki!" Ranma was surprised to receive a compliment from the ice queen.</p><p>"Don't  mention it."</p><p>There was a  long silence as everyone ate. After a while, Soun, having eaten a little of  everything passed his judgment. "Yes, this is pretty good. Kasumi didn't  help you with this?"</p><p>"Actually she helped me a lot. I probably wouldn't have been able to make  it if it hadn't been for her. But this morning I cooked. By myself"  Ranma smiled widely as he said the last part. His breakfast was on a par with  Kasumi's! He didn't even realize how modest he was being.</p><p>Genma  actually paused in his inhalation of food to say, "well  done, boy." This was too much. Something bad simply had to happen. Ranma's  eyes strayed to the other empty place at the table. A certain wrinkly,  hyperactive and hyper-perverted senior citizen was due to make an appearance  any minute now. Ranma didn't let it get to him. He was too happy. Nabiki,  Tendo-san, and even Pops had said how good his cooking was. In fact the only  one who hadn't said anything was...</p><p>Akane was  fuming. <i>Oh sure! Everyone just LOVES  Ranma's food! MY food is toxic waste, but not RANMA's.  Oh and let's not forget he's cuter than I am, HE can swim and HE'S a WAY better  martial artist. He's a MUCH better daughter than I am...AND HE'S A BOY! It's  not fair, it's not fair, IT'S NOT FAIR!</i> Akane's  battle aura was blood red and whipping about her head like a silk sheet in a  tornado.</p><p>"Um...Akane?" Ranma asked cautiously.</p><p>"WHAT." Akane replied furiously.</p><p>"Is...  something wrong?"</p><p>"Oh  NOTHING..." Akane answered in a manner similar to what the devil might  sound like if someone said something bad about its mother, "You'll make a  good wife someday, RanKO!"</p><p>Everyone  stared at Akane, except Akane, of course, who was glaring at Ranma, seeing how  he would respond. Akane's eyes grew wide as saucers. Before anybody could say  anything, they heard a familiar cry. "SWEETO!"  Happosai practically flew form some unseen corner of the room and onto Ranma's  chest.</p><p>"Get offa me ya  old coot!" Onna-Ranma exclaimed as she dropkicked the perverted master  through the newly installed trapdoor in the ceiling. Nabiki absently noted that  that had been a solid investment after all. Ranma shuddered. She always felt  weird whenever he did that, and recently she had been having the feeling  longer, and longer.</p><p>Now everyone  was staring at Ranma, except for Ranma who was looking at Akane to see if she  was still angry. To Ranma's relief, shock and astonishment eclipsed her  previous feelings of rage and hate. "Why'dya call me that, Akane? You know that's a low blow. And why do ya look so surprised all of a sudden?" Ranma noticed  that everyone else looked the same way too. "Uh...why do ALL of you look  so surprised all of a sudden?" Actually, by that time, Nabiki had stopped  looking surprised. She knew about it already after all, but it was still hard  to believe. Ranma didn't notice this, but she did notice Genma's expression  turn from one of shock to one of grim seriousness.</p><p>"How  long have you been able to this, b-Ranma?"</p><p>"What?" Genma didn't answer. Ranma tried for the last strange thing  that happened. "Do you mean how long have I able to  change?" Genma gave a small nod. Ranma gave him a confused look,  "Since Jusenkyo, Pops, you remember. We both fell in the springs? You fell  in the Panda spring and I fell into Nyannichuan." Ranma tried to stop  there but couldn't help it. "Verrry  tragic story of young girl who drown there one-thousand five hundred year  ago."</p><p>Ranma  realized her father was still glowering. "Come on, did Happosai glomp me  into some sorta parallel universe or somethin'? When we get doused with cold water we turn into  our cursed forms. Hot water turns us back."</p><p>"Ranma..." Nabiki interjected</p><p>"What."</p><p>"Do you  need a towel?"</p><p>"No,  what would I need a towel...for." Onna-Ranma suddenly realized that aside  from the residual dampness from the hot kettle water, she was completely dry.  She had changed forms without water. "I... Why am I...  What the hell's goin' on?"</p><p>"We were  kinda wondering the same thing." Nabiki offered.</p><p>"I must  be dreaming!" Ranma said as she pinched herself, but except for the small  pain, nothing happened.</p><p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~<br/>End notes:</p><p>It gets  weirder.</p><p>Thanks to  John C Watson who pointed out some of the problems with the original.</p><p>C+C welcome.</p>
