</div><p>WARNING: This chapter gets pretty dark. I'm pretty sure, though, that this chapter is about as dark as it's going to get. Things get a <i>teensy bit </i> brighter at the end. If you get upset at something that happens, please skim, yes skim if you must, to the end and read the last section before making any judgments.</p><p>Thyself Known</p><p>A Ranma ½ fanfic by Zorknot</p><p>DISCLAIMER: Linda sat holding little Rupert up by his hands. "Come, on, you can do it!"She encouraged. Tentatively she let go. Rupert was standing! He even took a few staggering steps before collapsing on the floor. "You did it Rupee! You did it!" Linda cried and held Rupert in her arms. Rupert gurgled happily and said "Yes mother, but I'm afraid characters and situations from Ranma ½ are the property of Rumiko Takahashi and their other owners and not the author of this fanfic."</p><p>~~~~Chapter12: Pain and Death~~~~~</p><p><i>As the pain sweeps through</i></p><p><i>Makes no sense for you</i></p><p><i>Every thrill has gone</i></p><p><i>Wasn't too much fun at all</i></p><p><i>But I'll be there for you</i></p><p><i>As the world falls down</i></p><p>David Bowie/Trevor Jones – As the World Falls Down</p><p>~~~~~red haze~~~~~</p><p>Ranko dragged herself along the concrete. There was still pain, but even as bad as it was, Ranko was used to pain. She had screamed. Her throat was raw from it. But she was done with that. The worst that could happen, or close to it, had already happened. Ranko still felt she was a coward compared to what she had been, but now there was nothing to fear. Her Art was gone, her legs nothing but two pieces of dead meat. But that also meant there was no point in being Ranko. Let her mother come at her with that sword. Let anything come. She was Saotome Ranma. She pulled herself forward again. She would make good on her promise to Kasumi.</p><p><i>~You don't get it, do you?~</i> The evil old man's voice screeched from inside. ~<i>I can take your arms too. Would you like me to take your arms?~ </i>Glowing liquid metal fell from above Ranma's head and spattered on her forearms it wasn't hot, but cold. Freezing cold.</p><p>Ranma stopped, staring at the black metal curling around her arm, down to her wrists. Her voice came out in a seething growl. "What do you want from me?"</p><p>The evil thing inside her laughed. ~<i>Do you want me to show you? Do you?~</i></p><p>~~~~~panic~~~~~</p><p>It wasn't something Kodachi had planned on. The kitsune's father had surprised her, walking out of the bar. He came out just as she was jumping past. Kabuto had been beside her carrying the kitsune's limp form like a ridiculously oversized knapsack, the false girl's body easily twice as large as Kabuto's. Tendo was angry at her, almost vicious, like no older person had ever really been to her before. He wanted to know what she was doing with his daughter, demanded that she put her down.</p><p>She started to explain that it wasn't his daughter, that Nabiki was really a kitsune who was trying to fool him, but she couldn't figure out how to say it. Tendo-san was nothing but a peasant…but he was older. More than that. There was something in his eyes that Kodachi had longed for. Something that she had always wanted, but despite torturing and seducing scores of men young and old, she could not find. Something she saw in a brief flash in Ranma-sama's eyes that night when he had caught her from falling. She had just about given up on ever seeing it again, but here it was, being wasted on a fake person. A spiritual con artist.</p><p>It just wasn't fair. Kodachi had noble blood, possessed skill and cunning beyond any other in the region, save perhaps Ranma-sama, and some subhuman deviant managed to steal somebody's love, when Kodachi had trouble even finding it. For a moment the pain sliced through Kodachi's perspective, and it seemed in that brief time like she wasn't powerful or noble. It didn't seem like she was anything more than a confused, lonely girl, running through the streets in a leotard. Running with her eyes closed, as fast as she could.</p><p>The feeling passed, though, and the emptiness of it was soon filled with acid rage. She practically tore a battle ribbon out of her hair and snapped it around the man's body in a python grip. The man was taken by surprise, but he pulled out a knife, from somewhere and tried to cut through the ribbon, not knowing that the ribbon was special, woven with strands of steel and that the knife wouldn't do anything but give Kodachi time to squeeze the air out of his body. Kodachi tightened the ribbon with a pull, and then tightened it again, each act riding on an acid wave of hate. Until the man collapsed, his body going slack, held only by the coils of ribbon. The knife he was holding did not clatter to the ground. It simply disappeared. Kodachi saw this but didn't really notice it. For her it only registered as a vague feeling of uneasiness, of something not quite right with things.</p><p>A feeling she banished with a throaty laugh, a flourish of her ribbon and a spray of black rose petals, purely for her own benefit as there were no onlookers as far as Kodachi could see. Slightly irritated at this realization, she called Orochimaru and Kabuto, and they appeared in a rush of wind. The cowards must have run off when the Tendo patriarch came out. She would have to punish them later. For now she just ordered them to carry Tendo-san's and the kitsune's body as she set forth once again for her mansion.</p><p>~~~~~demon past~~~~~</p><p>Ranma is standing in a subway, wedged within a throng of people. She knows this is a dream, because the people don't have faces and the ceiling flows with a river of blood. Ranma is female in the dream. She is wearing a girl's high school uniform, but not the Furinkan uniform. This is some other area of Tokyo. Some earlier time.</p><p>Someone steps hard on Ranma's foot, crushing the bone. Ranma cries out. The person that steps on her is the wretched old man from the prison. The Iron man. Even with the terrible pain of the real world to compare to, it doesn't change the fact that her dream foot hurts terribly. Ranma wants to cry, to give in. But the old man is grinning widely, looking at her expectantly. She may be a girl in this dream the demon concocted, but Ranma will not allow the evil wretch see her weakness. She can hold it in. She can turn it into anger, into sharpness. "What is this?" She darts her eyes left and right to indicate her surroundings.</p><p>"This is where I met you first, my little death doll. You were standing on the edge, over there."</p><p>The no-faced people part like a curtain, revealing a girl, dressed the same way Ranma is, her hair in a long, black ponytail, leaning forward on the edge of the concrete. Ranma knows what she is doing. She is looking for the light of a train. She is waiting for the right moment to jump.</p><p>From the side, a man approaches. A middle-aged man, wearing a thick, buttoned shirt with the sleeves rolled up. There are odd stains in the shirt. They look odd because they are not stains, but burns. This is the iron man. The man speaks. "Don't do it," he says, his voice crackly like paper, not strident like it is now.</p><p>"Why not?" the girl asks, "All the world can offer me is pain."</p><p>"I can give you more pain. If you like."</p><p>The girl turns around fully now. Her eyes are suddenly flames. Actual flames, making her face look like the front of a burning building.</p><p>"Sit with me on the next train. I'll tell you about my foundry."</p><p>Ranma tries to grab the girl, to shake her, but her hands don't just pass through the girl's body, they stick there, as if she were made of tar. "Don't do it! He's a creep, come on!" But the girl nods. And Ranma feels herself pulled into the girl's body. She struggles against it, but she can find no purchase on the ground. Her feet slide into the girl's feet, merging. In moments Ranma's legs are the girls legs, her waist is merged, her shoulders. Only Ranma's head remains her own and even as she strains her neck attempting to escape, the girl moves her legs and Ranma moves with her. "Stop it! He's not-" but Ranma's mouth is soon covered by the tar of the girl's head.</p><p>~~~~~cedar~~~~~</p><p>Hoko was looking through her dresses and mousy outfits for something remotely kick ass to save Nabiki in, when her mother entered her room and closed the door. Somehow Hoko could tell just by the sound that Harumi was about to give her a Talk. She closed her eyes and turned around.</p><p>When she opened them she saw her mother as expected, looking uncomfortable. Harumi walked to Hoko's bed and sat on the corner. She held her hands clasped on her lap and she was looking at them.</p><p>"What is it, Mom?"</p><p>Harumi looked up and then gestured for Hoko to sit next to her.</p><p>Hoko sighed and did as her mother asked. She was pretty sure she wasn't going to like this.</p><p>"Honey, I know your friend is in trouble and you want to help. Just for the record, if it were up to me, you wouldn't be leaving tonight, but things are different now, whether I want them to be or not, and I just have to live with that."</p><p>"Okay?" Hoko urged her mother to continue.</p><p>"When you came in earlier, you said a lot of things to me, that didn't all register at the time. You explained a lot of it to your father and me, but…There's one thing I heard you say earlier, that you didn't talk to us about."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Honey, you said you were r-"</p><p>"Oh!" Hoko interrupted. She gave a nervous laugh, "No, that was…It wasn't really…I mean." Hoko looked down. "I'm a little conflicted about it. I'm not sure if what happened to me counts, as, you know, r-rape, but whenever I say to myself, that 'no, it wasn't' that feels wrong too."</p><p>"Could you tell me what happened? Only if you're okay to talk about it."</p><p>Hoko paused. She felt the acid hate from what happened to her well up inside her again. A terrible hate, just a step left of despair. She took a breath and let it out. "You know most of it. It's just…you don't know what it was like. He used my body, said things and…did things I would never do."</p><p>Harumi tried to put her arm around Hoko, but Hoko pushed it off and sat farther away. "You don't understand. While he was using my body, he…um…masturbated. I know we talked about that, and it's not like I haven't ah, you know. But when Copycat did it, it was different. He didn't care about hurting my body, he wanted to feel pain, to feel like he was still a person somehow. He was very rough. More into… penetration. And I was there, stuck in my own head, seeing everything, feeling everything. I…I couldn't even scream."</p><p>"I'm so sorry. All that was going on under my own roof and I didn't even know!"</p><p>"How could you, Mom? Even if you had caught me, caught Copycat, you would have thought it was just me acting out or something. You would have thought it was a phase just like you think what I'm doing now is a phase. Even Doctor Tofu couldn't tell what was going on, because the piece of my soul that copycat stole made my aura look the same."</p><p>"You're right. You're right." Harumi sighed. "I guess I just thought you were safe, that nothing like this would happen to you. I don't know what to do now. Part of me wants to lock you in your room and never let you out, never let the world in, but I know that's wrong. Selfish."</p><p>Hoko scooted back closer to her mother, and leaned against her. "You're a good mom, Mom."</p><p>Harumi leaned her head against Hoko's. "How are you holding up? Do you want to talk to someone about it?"</p><p>Hoko stiffened. By "someone" Hoko knew her mother meant a psychologist or some other expert. "No. I don't. I keep on thinking of girls who actually got raped and what they would think of my story. I don't know if it's really the same thing. Besides that, I don't like the idea anyway. I mean I'd much rather not have been raped if I can help it. If I'm raped it means I have to be this victim, this broken person." Hoko took a shuddering breath, a lump forming in her throat, "But I am a victim, I am a broken person. If I wasn't, I wouldn't be trying so hard not to be."</p><p>Hoko felt her mother give her an assuring squeeze. "You're not a victim. That's not who you are. We are not defined by what happens to us, but what we do about it afterward. I look at you, and I see what my daughter has become, a brave young woman who is willing to fight for her friends."</p><p>"But what if that's all a lie!"</p><p>Harumi stood up and held Hoko's shoulders with her hands. "If it's a lie, then stay here in your room and let someone else take care of Nabiki. Because I'll love you no matter what."</p><p>Hoko closed her eyes as her mother kissed her on the forehead and released her. "Goodnight, sweetie. And be careful okay?"</p><p>"Okay, Mom, I will."</p><p>It was only after her mother left that Hoko realized that both she and her mother already knew what she was going to do. Otherwise why say "be careful?"</p><p>Hoko had responded without even thinking. She hadn't even considered staying home. She was going by herself into the city an hour before midnight, hoping to help save her friend from a crazed gymnast. That was something that the old Hoko, normal Hoko, would only have dreamed of doing, but that was who she was now. And somehow it was that realization, rather than all the stuff she had told her mom on her bed, that started her crying.</p><p>She gave a little scream and pounded the bed with her fist. This was so annoying! She didn't have time for this shit.</p><p>Giving up on finding something else to wear, Hoko found her way through blurry tear-vision down the stairs and into the garage where her motorcycle waited. She breathed deeply a few times and wiped the tears from her face. It took another minute sitting on the bike, but the crying jag passed like a summer shower, and Hoko felt better. She opened the garage door, tied her hair back with a scrunchi, put her helmet on her head, keyed the ignition, and revved the engine once or twice. Then, remembering what she had learned tonight, she turned the engine off and on again, only this time without the key.</p><p>Then Hoko zoomed out of her driveway, smiling like a lunatic.</p><p>~~~~~derision~~~~~</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno observed his sister make a few paltry practice feints with one of the family katana. In truth, he was ambivalent, for was it not good that his sister realize the power of kendo? But was it not a disgrace for her to stagger about so oafishly with a Kuno family blade? And yet was it not also hilarious to watch? "My sister, perchance you'll allow me to assist you in this, your latest endeavor?"</p><p>"I'll have you know, dear brother, that I can wield a blade as artfully as you can. Certainly better than you can manipulate any of my instruments." She stood, back straight holding the blade much as she would a length of ribbon, and indeed it seemed an artful pose, although entirely unfit for actual combat.</p><p>"I'm afraid you are mistaken, sister. The blade is like unto a mischievous mistress, easy to embrace, but difficult to master. Your flailings are the movements of a petulant child. I fail to see how you hope to impress your hostages with such a display."</p><p>Tendo Nabiki, and her father, Tendo Soun, were both bound to concrete pillars in the main atrium of the Kuno mansion. Tatewaki wasn't overly worried. Sasuke had reported only yesterday that he had finished his monthly chore of filing down Mr. Turtle's teeth. Kodachi fancied herself a murderess, and if it is indeed intention and not action which defines a soul, then she was one in fact, but with care, Tatewaki was able to indulge his sister's fantasies without them ever reaching the level of actual homicide.</p><p>"I do not seek to impress these miscreants, brother. I seek truth and justice. This one, Tendo Nabiki, is not a mere money grubbing harridan. She is a wicked kitsune, and I will reveal her as such to her 'father' before I behead her with this blade."</p><p>"What evidence do you have of this?"</p><p>"Direct evidence. I've seen her cloaked in illusion and I saw a malevolent spirit rise from where she rested."</p><p>"Hmm…A kitsune, you say." Tatewaki rubbed his chin in thought. There was some merit to the idea. Nabiki was crafty, was she not? And mischievous. What if it were she, and not Saotome who was the magician that continually thwarted him?</p><p>Kodachi caught the gesture. "Ohohoho! Yes, she's the one who caused you so much pain! There is no redhead, dear brother. That girl is just a sick illusion made up by this wench."</p><p>Tatewaki hadn't thought it through that far, "What? No! You are mistaken, sister," Tatewaki said, growing more convinced of the merit of his words as he said them, "It is the <i>male</i> Ranma that is the illusion, as you would know if you visited Furinkan with greater frequency. Oft I find my beloved in her true form and only rarely anymore is she clothed in the appearance of masculinity."</p><p>"Now, brother, I know your grip on reality is tenuous at best, but you have seen the same vision I have. Why would a kitsune bother ravishing someone of the same sex?"</p><p>"The mischief of kitsune knows no bounds, sister. And it was no vision you and I saw, my deranged sibling, but a news broadcast. I suppose next you will assure me that those colored squares occluding the view of the act were evidence of Nabiki's power?"</p><p>"Oh brother! Tell me you did not just accuse ME of being an anachronism? Has no one shown you the news broadcast declaring bushido dead? "</p><p>Even Kodachi seemed to realize she had gone too far. Her eyes widened a little and she backed up a half step before she righted herself.</p><p>Tatewaki rushed toward Kodachi and past her to stand between her and the bound Nabiki. "Bushido is not dead. Not so long as those such as I continue to practice its teachings. And I have made a decision. I will not allow you to execute the kitsune. If she is clever enough to fashion such illusions as we both have witnessed, then she is clever enough to fashion one around an innocent. Suppose this were not truly Nabiki, but your precious Ranma-sama. What worth would your vengeance be, if it resulted in his death?"</p><p>"Ranko!" The name was spoken in a gasp. It was spoken by Tendo Nabiki. Tatewaki turned to look at her. Her eyes were glowing green. Any remaining doubt that Nabiki was a kitsune was erased from his mind. Nabiki struggled briefly against her bonds. Then her eyes flashed to Tatewaki and then to Kodachi. They thinned. "Let me go. I have to go to her."</p><p>"OHOHOHOHOHOHO! Just as in legend your eyes have revealed your true nature, kitsune. "</p><p>Tatewaki could not help but stare in awe as a pulsating green aura seeped out of Nabiki and formed a long pseudopod that angled toward Kodachi. She waved at it with the sword but instead of dissipating it, the sword seemed to get stuck in the blob of the aura. Kodachi immediately let go, and the sword continued to levitate, bending slowly until the tip was almost touching the hilt. Then the katana was thrown away, clattering somewhere behind Tatewaki.</p><p>There were three audible snaps as the bonds about Nabiki's wrists ankles and waist were torn apart. And then, like a balloon popping without sound, the glowing green aura suddenly just wasn't there. Nabiki was free from her bonds. And now, she took a shaking step forward…</p><p>~~~~~heat~~~~~</p><p>The foundry is not the large factory operation that Ranma expected. The iron man is the owner of a largish estate in the countryside of Japan. In a large blackened patch of earth a cylindrical object roughly the size of a pickle bucket, spews out fire. This is the foundry.</p><p>The girl that Ranma can't get away from lies face down in a rough wooden crate. She is naked. She can feel the cold, grainy, hard-packed sand around her body. She breathes heavily through the straw in her mouth. The sand is flush against the lid to the crate. She cannot move enough to get out. She has started to panic, but it is too late.</p><p>"I was going to let her out at this point." The Iron Man crows cheerfully, and Ranma can hear his voice as if it is at her ear, even though she can only see and feel what the girl can. "I let the previous ones out. My subjects. I let them out and poured the metal afterwards like a good little boy. But then I got <i>curious</i>."</p><p>The lid comes up, and the girl feels the air against her flesh. She is glad. She doesn't want to end her life anymore and maybe her statue will be famous some day. She has something to tell her friends besides that Taro is seeing Konojo now and that she was never anything other than a sex doll to the bastard. Then she feels a splash of heat. Then a splash of searing torture. She screams but she can't open her jaw so the sound is muffled. The heat gets worse and worse, she tries to get up, but moving only makes the burning spread and she still doesn't have any leverage.</p><p>"The sand's synthetic," the iron man explains. "It's mixed with a resin. It's like concrete. When the metal pours into the mold, the sand allows the gasses to escape without destroying the pattern. Living tissue fucks that up, though. Humans are seventy-five percent water. They boil when the metal touches them. They sizzle like a piece of bacon. It smells a little like bacon too." He seems pleased with this assessment.</p><p>The burning spreads and seems to go deeper, into shoulders, stomach, lungs. The girl cannot breathe. She convulses. She coughs out blood, but it has nowhere to go, so it stays in her mouth. It is the only thing other than pain she experiences before she dies.</p><p>And yet Ranma remains. Ranma remains to feel the metal continue to pool around the girl's neck, her legs. She can feel it crest over the back of her head, she can feel it boil the back of her brain.</p><p>"This is when I realized my true calling!" The Iron man screams. "After sixty-six years I finally understood! "</p><p>Ranma can feel the skin and muscle begin to dry out and char, can feel flesh pulling away from bone even as the front of her body, farthest away from the metal, starts sizzling.</p><p>"This is when I became immortal!"</p><p>~~~~~tired~~~~~</p><p>"Look, if it were just you, maybe I'd keep out of it. But you're being stupid on an epic scale here, doctor. This is like 'hey I wonder what happens if I press this red button that says ATOMIC BOMB' stupid." Detective Inamura's voice gave Tofu the incongruous impression of a weary buzz saw.</p><p>"I'm telling you, Detective, that I am not relaxing, I have done everything that can be done." Tofu turned his head to yawn away from the phone's receiver. " I have safety measures in place that will absolutely ensure that Ranma will not hurt himself or anyone around him. "</p><p>"He needs to be watched by someone who knows what he's doing and who can do something about it." Inamura managed to give the air of having interrupted Tofu without actually doing it. "That's either you or me, and neither of us are there."</p><p>"That's not necessary. It's under control." Kasumi was there too, Tofu didn't add. If Kasumi had to intercede she would be in bed for a month, recovering, if she ever did recover.</p><p>"Under control? Let me tell you something about under control. Nineteen seventy-three through eighty-one, a bunch of kids go missing without a trace. People call it a kamikakushi, they're just spirited away by the gods. We say we're pursuing all leads, it's under control.</p><p>"Then one of the parents recognizes their daughter in a metal statue on sale at some auction. Turns out the poor thing is dead <i>inside</i> the statue. We go on a manhunt. We find the guy who did it, the 'Iron Man' the press calls him. We go after him, it's under control.</p><p>" But no, turns out he's off to Hawaii, and we have to inform the US government that they have a serial killer on their turf. They say they'll take care of it. 'It's under control,' they say.</p><p>" A year later Five more girls end up dead over there. All at the same time, and by the time the Americans find out about it, he's back over here. I'm in charge. I lead a team and eventually catch him and kill him. Finally, it's under control.</p><p>"But no, it isn't. Because it happens again in Okinawa, nineteen eighty-four. In Shanghai, nineteen eighty six, and in Ann-Arbor, Michigan in the U.S. in nineteen eighty-seven. And those are just the ones we know about. The press had made the Iron man into a minor deity and so he lived on after death. He became a demon. He hit Japan again shortly after the Ann-Arbor murder, and it was only by luck we were able to perform an exorcism before his last vessel was executed, and we threw him in a temporally isolated jail cell. Finally we had the bastard under control.</p><p>" Then he managed to wrap part of himself around a seventeen year old's spine and escape an inescapable prison. So excuse me if I'm a little hesitant to believe that you have everything 'under control'."</p><p>Tofu sighed. "I'll go back to the Tendo's, okay? That make you happy?"</p><p>"Ecstatic. You know I'd go myself, only I have four impending apocalypses to prevent while you only have the one. Why does the boundary between realities have to be a curtain for the gods' sakes? Why can't it be a nice thick brick wall?" Detective Inamura hung up.</p><p>Tofu put the receiver back on its cradle and stared for a while at the hole in his bedroom floor that Ranma had made with Tofu's head. He began to have a sneaking suspicion that maybe Detective Inamura was right. Maybe it was stupid for him to go back to his place above the clinic. But there wasn't anywhere to sleep at the Tendo's and he was exhausted. Besides, as long as Nabiki and Ranma stayed close there shouldn't be a problem, and from how they were acting it didn't seem like they'd have any trouble with that.</p><p>The phone rang again, startling Tofu. He picked up the receiver.</p><p>"Tofu?" Kasumi's melodious voice said.</p><p>"Y-yes?" Tofu responded, willing his glasses not to fog up.</p><p>"I'm afraid one of Ranma's friends is playing a nasty game with Nabiki-chan, and Ranma-chan is um…she's screaming and writhing on the ground, and I think she might be paralyzed. Do you think you could come over?"</p><p>Tofu didn't answer right away. Inamura was right. Tofu hadn't just been stupid, but stupendously, monumentally stupid. <i>Literally, </i>Tofu thought<i>. They should construct monuments to just how mind-numbingly stupid I've been.</i></p><p>"I'll be over as fast as I can, Kasumi," and Tofu hung up, already rushing out of his room.</p><p>~~~~~confusion~~~~~</p><p>Tatewaki was unsure for a moment how to proceed. He felt he should strike the creature down, but how powerful should he make the blow? Then, Nabiki stumbled and fell to the ground, unconscious.</p><p>"What manner of kitsune is this?" Tatewaki had never heard of a kitsune passing out from exhaustion after performing one of its tricks. Maybe this was some sort of test? Something to see how honorable he or his sister could be?</p><p>"What does it matter, brother? She should be killed before she awakes again." Kodachi had retrieved a halberd that had been on display on a nearby wall and was now approaching with murderous intent.</p><p>Before Kuno could protest, Sasuke fell from the ceiling between him and Kodachi. The little monkey man got up and bowed deeply to both of them, his face contorted in a look of concern, "Mistress and Master Kuno, I have news about the pigtailed girl!"</p><p>"We are busy at the moment, worm," Kodachi hit the ninja with the back of her hand. "Why did you escape the dungeon? I'll break you again!" One of Kodachi's flights of fancy again. Kuno shook his head, yesterday she was saying they had three ninja working for them. It had been just Sasuke for years, why she felt the need to concoct two imaginary ninja was beyond him.</p><p>Sasuke gave Kuno an anxious glance. Tatewaki stepped forward. "Stay yourself, sister, I would hear this news of my goddess."</p><p>"Thank you master!" Sasuke bowed exuberantly to Tatewake several times before continuing. "She seems to be gravely injured. I heard a scream, so I thought I would check it out. She's collapsed in front of the gate of the Tendo residence."</p><p>"I must go to her at once!"</p><p>Sasuke nodded. "I will leave to get more help in case it's needed." He disappeared in a blur, and Tatewaki rushed to leave.</p><p>"Don't be a fool, Brother."</p><p>Tatewaki turned around at the sound of his sister's piercing voice. "My love is in trouble. I must save her. I see no foolishness in my acts, only honor."</p><p>Kodachi laughed. "You truly are as daft as they say. Have we not determined that there is no such thing as the 'pigtailed girl'? That is merely an illusion concocted by this vile being."</p><p>"The illusion, sister, was of the male form, not the female one. To think of the times I mistreated her, thinking her male façade to be the arbiter of my beloved's absences, when in fact it was my goddess I railed against, disguised by magic! "</p><p>"Oh to be there with you when you run to your goddess, and find only your hated foe!" Kodachi lifted the halberd, "Let me but dispatch this creature, brother, and I'll accompany you on your delightfully quixotic adventure."</p><p>"No!." Tatewaki rushed back to Kodachi, his wooden sword ready to attack. "You will not harm her."</p><p>Kodachi slowly lowered her weapon. "Why do you protect this… thing, brother? You have been harmed by it almost as much as I."</p><p>"My other goddess is the fair Akane. This is her sister, or at least she has the form of her sister. How could I ever hope to garner fiery Akane's affections if I allowed a member of her family to come to harm?"</p><p>"You are insane! This is a vile kitsune, no doubt she created an image of that other harridan to fool you and I as well!"</p><p>Tatewaki advanced steadily toward his sister, keeping his sword at the ready. "If it is madness to not wish ill on those I love then indeed I am most insane. But I would far prefer such insanity to living a life void of affection. I will not allow myself to be imprisoned by my actions, to tear apart with an act of violence every thread that ties me to a world outside myself. I am not you, sister." With a sharp swipe of his bokken Tatewaki sliced Kodachi's halberd in two.</p><p>This accomplished, Tatewaki set about releasing Soun Tendo. "Awake, elder Tendo," Tatewaki lightly nudged the middle-aged man's shoulder once was freed. The man's breath smelled of sake. "You must attend to your daughter."</p><p>Soun's eyes snapped open and he immediately tensed. His gaze darted around the room until it found his daughter. "Nabiki! What have you done to her?" In a blink, the Tendo patriarch was suddenly clothed head to toe in samurai armor. Tatewaki stepped back, startled. Was he a kitsune too?</p><p>~~~~~inversion~~~~~</p><p>Ranma is in her body again. In the girl version of her body anyway. She is hanging by her leg above a ladle the size of the back of a truck. The ladle is filled with molten Iron, the light from it so bright that it would cause spots to form in her vision were this not some strange dream.</p><p>The old man performs a cartwheel around the hanging ladle, a puckish sprite, his solid black eyes reflecting the light of the metal ghoulishly, the wrinkles of his bare skin morphing into the faces of his victims as they cry in torment. "Of all the places I inhabited this was the best." The Iron man declares. "A full factory foundry! Abandoned! Just waiting for me to do my work."</p><p>Ranma stopped being impressed after the fifth victim. She lost count after the fifteenth. She is numb now. The heat and the pain of burning have begun to feel like old companions. She waits for them now. She prefers them to the old man's prattle. She has to remind herself to try to move. It has been so long since she could exercise any will at all. But now she is in her own body, well, not her body, but a body she is used to.</p><p>"It's not so different, is it, my little death doll?" Iron man spoke with a tone of condescension. "You've been living in a strange girl's body ever since you fell into Jusenkyo. Unable to do anything about it. You've been tossed by the whims of fate, forced to live a lie in order to keep from being executed. Are you really so different from my victims? Forced to live lives they didn't want, unable to break out of the pattern they found themselves in? You think I can't sympathize? I was an old man, forced into retirement, living alone. All I had was my art. But I used my art and turned it into something truly beautiful. Look how it shines!"</p><p>"I am not like you. Not one bit."</p><p>The Iron man jumps nimbly to the edge of the ladle, the glowing liquid metal sloshes as the ladle swings. When the movement steadies, the Iron man stands and grabs Ranma's pigtail. "Who are you then? Are you a martial artist? A cook? A cat? A human? A boy? A girl? Do you believe in anything? Do you have any kind of code that you've kept with any consistency? I'm offering you an identity. I'm giving you someone to be. Just surrender to me, let me guide you, let me tell you what you desire, and you shall have it."</p><p>Ranma frowns. "That's stupid."</p><p>It's almost imperceptible, but the brightness from the liquid metal dims. "It's not stupid! You've played by other people's rules your whole lifeI Your father, your teachers, Akane, your mother…"</p><p>"Y'know you're right? But I don't see how your rules are any better." Ranma feels something. It's Nabiki. She feels her through their link. Nabiki is doing something with her power. "I ain't gonna join you, so if it's all the same, I got a fiancée to rescue."</p><p>The metal dims more. All of the mad joy fades from the iron man's face. "You don't understand your situation, girl. If you don't join me, I kill you, that's the way it works. I'm really trying to be nice here."</p><p>Ranma finds she can move a little now. She moves her arms so that they cross at her chest. "You're pathetic! You can't kill me. You need me. If you were gonna kill me you'd've done it already. I've been a bit confused about things recently. I've been a bit upset. And that's probably how you got to me before. But I don't know. Maybe getting killed a bunch of times cleared my head or something, cause what you're sellin' just seems more n' more like a load of crap. Why should I have to choose between bein' a cook or a martial artist. Or between bein' girl or a boy for that matter? I like bein' both. So screw it, that's what I am. I'm both. Saotome school of Anything Goes living."</p><p>"But you can't be both," the iron man snickers. "You know what your fiancée did to you. She pushed away everything about you that was male. You're nothing but a girl now."</p><p>The metal brightens for a moment, but then it dims again. "Physically? Sure. But, way I figure, ki regenerates. So that part that I gave to Nabiki? It grew back. You probably helped with that. Cause all this time getting killed over and over? All I've wanted to do is kick your ass." With that, Ranma releases her ki claws and bends to where her ankle is tied to the chain and cuts, flipping to land in a three point crouch on the now perfectly solid and cool metal in the ladle.</p><p>"Good luck with that," the iron man says. And the dream fades into reality.</p><p>Ranma found herself still on the pavement, still unable to move her legs, her wrists heavy with the iron spattered on them from before. She felt Nabiki through their bond, passed out again. Taking a breath she pulled herself forward with her arms. The pain was still there, but it wasn't anything new. She was used to it now. She heard a snickering as she moved herself forward again. The black metal on her wrists, began to glow red, then orange, then white. It seared her flesh and tightened, crushing bone. This wasn't right. She defeated the bastard hadn't she? How was he still able to do this to her? She tried to continue moving forward centimeter by torturous centimeter, but when she saw her hands fall off like dead leaves from a sickly tree, she stopped. This wasn't some dream. This was her body. Her only body now that her male side was physically gone. She couldn't walk anymore, and now she couldn't even make a fist. How could she hope to save Nabiki?</p><p>The cackling rose in volume and pitch. The iron man couldn't kill her, that was true. But he didn't need to. Ranma had no idea how to attack him now, but she had to find a way.</p><p>~~~~~horror~~~~~</p><p>Kodachi laughed "Such a clever ruse! Switching bodies like that! It shan't work, though, vile one!" She pulled out a ribbon and spun it in the air a few times before launching it toward Tendo Soun. It snaked through all of his armor and wrapped around his neck. Kodachi pulled, and Tendo choked stumbling forward and falling to the floor. "Where is your trickery now, kitsune?" Three drops of blood fell to the floor from the man's neck.</p><p>Tatewaki paused for a moment to assess the situation. Should he save Tendo-san? There was a chance after all that the kitsune had changed bodies, wasn't there? He hadn't heard of anything like that, but then perhaps there were powers not covered in legend. Tatewaki shook his head free of his doubts and ran to sever his sister's ribbon.</p><p>But by the time he was in place a green glow erupted from the floor. Nabiki, or whatever she was, grabbed Kodachi's ankle. The green amoeba like aura moved from Nabiki's arm up Kodachi's leg with alarming speed.</p><p>Tatewaki blinked, panic rising within him. He quickly cut Kodachi's ribbon with the air from his bokken. "Unhand my sister, kitsune. She has released your ersatz father."</p><p>Instead the green aura wrapped around Kodachi's arms. Moving them against her will, the aura caused Kodachi to raise the sharpened edge of the ribbon to her own neck.</p><p>"Stop this now, Tendo Nabiki!" Tatewaki yelled. "You may not be human, but you are not a killer!"</p><p>Nabiki climbed up into a crouch, green aura surrounding her and Kodachi. She grinned, not her usual flirtatious, yet calculating smile, but an evil grin that didn't seem to belong to her. Not to his classmate. Not to his friend. "People change, Kuno-chan." And the green aura made his sister wrap the ribbon around her own neck in a quick motion. A spurt of blood passed through the fabric.</p><p>Kuno sent a swath of sharp air at the aura with a swing of his sword, but it only rippled. Was this a hallucination, or was this real? What if this was all in his head and he was at this very moment swinging at shadows? What if he was hurting people who didn't deserve it? But it all seemed too real. "Forgive me, Akane-sama." He swung his bokuto straight at Nabiki now. The aura caught the blade and slowed its path, but it still made a sizable gash in her neck. Nabiki's aura winked out and she fell to the floor again, a pool of red growing around her.</p><p>Kodachi fell to her knees gripping her neck.</p><p>"Dachi?" Kuno ran to his sister, wrapping an arm around her shoulder. "Dachi, is it bad? Is it deep?"</p><p>His sister lifted her hand from her neck a fraction of a centimeter and another spurt of blood passed through her fingers. "Mercutio" she whispered and fell back into Tatewaki's chest.</p><p>Tatewaki nodded solemnly. She meant Mercutio's line from Romeo and Juliet, the play they read to each other countless times as children: "'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve." His sister, his constant companion through his childhood, the one he was supposed to protect, was dying.</p><p>In front of him, lay the motionless body of Soun Tendo, a pool of dark red evidence that Kodachi had taken no half measures with the older man. Behind him lay Tendo's daughter dead by Tatewaki's own hand. He blinked. There was something moving on Nabiki's ear. A small, dark butterfly or moth. He watched as it fluttered into the air and out of the entrance to the conservatory.</p><p>That was odd. What did it signify though? Was Nabiki a kitsune? Tatewaki studied her features. She looked human for the most part. Were her ears a little pointed though? Yes! There was no mistake. They were. How had he missed it before? She had been a kitsune and she had been about to kill his sister. It was a justifiable act. Somehow though, that didn't seem to matter.</p><p>He sat motionless, hoping for it all to turn out to be a bad dream, hoping for a strong enough delusion to make the death retreat from his mind, as the seconds slipped by, and his sister grew colder in his arms.</p><p>~~~~~PAIN~~~~~</p><p><i>You really want to save that girl who manipulated you all those times?</i> The old man's voice screamed in Ranma's ear as she lay on her stomach. <i>You're both girls. She can hardly be your "mate" now. </i></p><p>Ranma was having trouble concentrating. Her throat was sore from screaming. Her eyes were like sand paper. Her back was a throbbing curtain of pain. Her arms felt like they were still burning. Her adrenaline was wearing off fast and she still couldn't think of how to fight something she couldn't see, something that was inside her.</p><p><i>I could help you, you know. I could make it so you could walk again. So you could fight. </i></p><p>"No," Ranma whispered hoarsely. But doubts were creeping in. All her grandstanding earlier had gotten her nowhere. Maybe she should just give up? She had tried to do the right thing for all her life, and look where it got her. She was both a boy and a girl? That was ridiculous. Obviously she could only be a girl now. Ranko looked at her ruined hands. She couldn't even cook now. Someone would have to help her eat. She was weak, worthless. Maybe she could have been something once but now... She would only ever be a burden to anybody.</p><p><i>No one could possibly love you as you are. You think Nabiki wants to wipe your ass every time you shit yourself?</i></p><p>Ranko let out a low moan. She felt sick. Sick of the pain, sick of caring. Sick of life. There was a sudden emptiness that she didn't want to contemplate, and she could tell it made the iron man excited. But it was too much. She couldn't deal with that now. A moth fluttered away, passing only briefly through Ranko's vision. She knew on some level that it meant something, but she couldn't think of what it was.</p><p>Then Ranko saw Kasumi through the red haze of her vision. "Ranko? Tofu's coming. Try to bear it just a little longer."</p><p><i>Stop trying to fool yourself. Kasumi isn't out here. She's in her safe little kitchen, playing house. She doesn't care about you at all.</i></p><p>There was no way that could be true. But what if it was? Kasumi was nice to everyone. Maybe it was just something she did for everyone.</p><p><i>That's right. She's just being nice to you because she's scared. You'd like to kill her, wouldn't you?</i></p><p>"What?" Ranko didn't want to kill Kasumi. She didn't want to kill anybody.</p><p><i>Get real! She was never on your side. Neither was Nabiki. She destroyed your manhood, and now, well haven't you noticed?</i></p><p>No.</p><p><i>Come now, you pitiful whore, It was the closest connection you ever had with anyone. And. Now. It's GONE! </i> Ranko's mind filled with the shrieking laughter of the demon inside of her.</p><p>That emptiness… Ranko knew what it was. A gaping hole of loneliness where Nabiki used to be. Their connection was severed. Nabiki was either dead or…</p><p><i>She abandoned you. She abandoned you, just like I said she would. She never loved you. She used you, and now she's thrown you away. You have nobody.</i></p><p><i>Nobody but me.</i></p><p>~~~~~throbbing~~~~~</p><p>The Kuno mansion was usually pretty impressive from the street. It usually took up several blocks and towered over all the surrounding buildings. It usually boasted a broad array of booby traps and other "security devices" that would test even an expert thief's ability to evade them. Genma was, of course, not just an expert thief, but a master thief. He had thievery down to such an art form he had to bungle things up just to give himself a challenge. But instead of the Kuno mansion Genma was familiar with, all he saw was a largish, but rather run down and dilapidated house, about the size of the Tendo's property, with long, wild grass around it and evidence of negligence and decay everywhere. There were two other houses around the main house and they too had an abandoned, run down appearance.</p><p>Genma's hangover was in full swing now. The terrible sinking feeling in his gut complemented his preexisting nausea in an unfortunate way. Genma put a hand on the property wall an leaned forward, vomiting. The stomach acid made tears well up in his eyes. But then that too was oddly appropriate.</p><p>The last time Genma remembered the Kuno property ever being less than a palatial estate, was eleven years ago, when Kuno Dokume, Kodachi and Tatewaki's mother, died. Her obituary declared it suicide, and Genma supposed that was accurate enough. It wasn't an accident, and it was by Dokume's own hand. It probably wasn't strictly intentional on Dokume's part, but that was difficult to prove, and complicated, and the job of an obituary is to simplify a life into a paragraph.</p><p>Denial. That was Dokume's demon. Born into a rich family of noble lineage, she could never believe that she could lose all her money and standing, and she was so good at convincing herself, she convinced everyone around her too. She even convinced reality itself. But of course if she had money, it only stood to reason that assassins would want to kill her and take that money. Perfectly logical. So logical that she ended up killed by said assassins. It wasn't murder, strictly speaking. Her fingerprints were on the murder weapon. But it wasn't really suicide either. Then again, there wasn't a word for what it was. "Accident" wouldn't cut it. Suicide would do in a pinch.</p><p>After she died, for almost a week the Kuno property looked like an abandoned building, fit to be condemned. But then Dokume's demon took up residence in her children and husband, and the place grew even more extravagant than before.</p><p>Genma rubbed a mossy stone with his hand. If the Kuno property had reverted, it meant that one of the Kunos had died again. It was probably Kodachi, which meant either Nabiki, Soun or the both of them did something they weren't going to be particularly pleased about.</p><p>Genma didn't want to go in.</p><p>The roar of something drew Genma's attention. Someone was approaching on a vehicle that looked like a motorcycle, but sounded like an active volcano. The person was followed by a somewhat tamer police motorcycle. They both stopped at the entrance next to Genma.</p><p>The one on the monster took off her helmet shaking her hair free. A girl about Ranma's age, she had long black hair in a ponytail with a few thin streaks of an orange-red color. It was a much different shade from Ranma's girl side, more natural, yet there was still something odd about how the color was there even under the blue of the streetlight. "Okay, who moved the Kuno's place?" The girl had a strange, fierce look about her.</p><p>The police bike had the number 542. It was officer Kawagami's bike, so when he removed his helmet there weren't any surprises there. "What do you mean?" His mirrored sunglasses made him seem eerily aloof. "This is it, isn't it?"</p><p>The girl turned to her companion. "The Kunos own a mansion. I've passed by it a thousand times so I know it's supposed to be here. I even went inside once when I was interviewing Kuno for the paper. The place was unbelievably huge. Not like this."</p><p>Genma frowned and pointed his finger at the girl. "You're here because Nabiki got kidnapped right?"</p><p>"Yeah. Oops! Sorry." The girl took a few steps toward Genma. " We haven't been formally introduced. I am Tomo Hoko. Go easy on me. I think you've met Hiro-kun, I mean, Kawagami-san."</p><p>Genma blinked slowly a few times. "Aren't you supposed to be dead?"</p><p>Hoko grimaced. "The real Tomo Hoko's dead. I'm just a clone."</p><p>"You're not just a clone, Hoko-cha- I mean, Tomo-san. You're you. You're a person."</p><p>Genma sighed. Officer Kawagami was pretty young, it actually didn't seem that bad a match, but the kid could get in trouble if he wasn't more careful.</p><p>Hoko shrugged and smiled, though the smile didn't quite reach her eyes. "I suppose I'm seven eighths of a person anyway." She turned to Genma again. "Do you know what happened, Uncle Saotome?"</p><p>Genma nodded. He looked up at the roof of the building, or what was left of it anyway. "My guess, is that one of the Kunos died. Probably Kodachi-chan. Poor girl."</p><p>"Okay…wow. That's some information I wasn't expecting. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Or what that has to do with the lack of a mansion…Oh well. I'll just figure it out later. We going in?" Hoko bent her head toward the house. Hiro shrugged and they both entered the front yard, walking their motorcycles inside the property wall.</p><p>Genma followed them, not having a good enough excuse to stay outside. He didn't want to go in, but then reality never got better by ignoring it. Genma learned that much from Kuno Dokume.</p><p>~~~~~thyself known~~~~~</p><p>The first tiny butterfly was already perched on Tofu's finger as he stood on the sidewalk, staring as it waved its wings. When the second arrived, it landed next to its mate, their wings touched for the briefest of moments and then both insects disappeared like a popped soap bubble.</p><p>The thyself known was a magical artifact, a thing connected inextricably with the world of the numinous. An object possessing a sort of intelligence of its own. Sometimes such things had a way of reminding their users of their place in the world, of prophecies and destinies as well as of the things that could not be known. Whether they did this out of compassion or out of a cruel sense of humor, Tofu wasn't sure, but he got the message.</p><p>He and Kasumi would become one. It was something unavoidable. Not at all like the vague cloud that surrounded Ranma. This would happen as surely as the sun would rise tomorrow. The thyself known didn't have to make contact with Tofu at all. It could have simply winked back into its nullspace and waited for its next summons. But instead it delivered this message to Tofu.</p><p>Two messages. Because if the two halves of thyself known weren't with Ranma and Nabiki, it meant that Ranma or Nabiki, or gods forbid it, both of them, were dead.</p><p>This was bad.</p><p>Tofu started running again, faster now toward the Tendo residence. He ran for two blocks, then slowed when he saw Ranma writhing in agony, obviously paralyzed. The concrete around her was mere rubble, her clothes were in tatters, and something black and solid looking was growing out of her back and into the ground. A strong warm wind blew through Tofu's gi and then an equally strong cold one. The ki in the cold wind tasted, for lack of a better term, like Ranma's soul of ice, but the hot wind held a far more sinister energy. And each time the hot wind came back it was stronger and hotter. Kasumi and Nodoka were watching with concern from what they must have believed was a safe distance back.</p><p>There was no safe distance.</p><p>This was real bad.</p><p>Tofu reviewed his options. He could probably kill Ranma. Really that was probably the safest bet. The only way to ensure the redhead didn't go on a rampage and kill everybody. But while that made sense logically, no amount of reasoning could convince Tofu that was a real option. Until Ranma was lost irrevocably, he would not use the artifact. Really the best weapon was psychology, but that was not his field. If he could some how restrain Ranma, so that Kasumi, could talk with her safely… But it had been hard enough to restrain Ranma last time, and based off the energy she was giving off, her strength had gone up a hundredfold. Moreover the iron demon was an unknown quantity. He needed more people. He needed more information.</p><p>Bracing himself, Tofu ran into the winds again, angling toward Kasumi. The air was rotating around Ranma, Tofu realized, and he altered his trajectory to take advantage of the wall of the Tendo residence, which blocked the current somewhat. Even with the wall helping, eddy currents made it hard to walk as he got closer. Finally he got through the entrance and to Kasumi, where the wind was less intense.</p><p>"You and Mrs. Saotome need to get inside!" Tofu yelled over the rush of the wind.</p><p>Kasumi nodded. With a tilt of her head she invited Tofu into the house. It was so elegant a gesture, so poised, feminine and at the same time belying the hidden strength he knew was inside her, that Tofu nearly lost it. She was so perfect! But he couldn't let himself lose focus now. He gave Ranma another glance. It felt wrong to go inside while she was still out there suffering, but there was nothing he could without more resources. He followed Kasumi into the house.</p><p>"I called you, the Nekohanten, and Akane. Akane's much too far away to make it here in time, that's probably for the best. I only wish Grandfather Happosai were still here."</p><p>~~~~~silky darlings~~~~~~</p><p>Happosai wondered why he hadn't done this before. It was so easy to sneak into the cargo hold of an airplane it was ridiculous. Just a short hop at the right moment when no one was looking and he could go anywhere in the world. Not only that, but he would travel alongside a veritable cornucopia of womanly undergarments! It was heaven.</p><p>Gathering a good size collection of the lacy gems he had found during the long international flight, Happosai prepared to make his exit. He was just about to make a real flashy show of things by blasting out of the hold with a well placed flick of his pipe when one of the airport personnel was kind enough to save him the trouble, opening the latch and letting in the air of San Francisco. Six hours ahead and one day back, it was five thirty in the morning, yesterday.</p><p>The airport worker was a young, lanky looking fellow with a moustache who seemed to be just recovering from a chronic acne problem. "Ekusukyuzu mii, boi," He greeted the young man, "Kan yuu teru mii anisingu abauto sekusuraru haraasumento?"</p><p>The kid said something fast in English. It took Happosai a little bit to parse it. He sounded out the expression. "Uatto ta heru…" He nodded. The kid had said "What the hell?" It was a little awkward, but then English was a hackneyed, made-up language so it was to be expected that there'd be difficulties. Happosai decided trying to talk any further with the kid would be a waste of time. "Toodles," Happosai said in Japanese and bounded out of the cargo hold carrying a bulging bag of panties and bras on his back like a demented midget beardless Santa…on uppers.</p><p>"Hey!" The kid yelled, "You can't do that!"</p><p>Happosai smiled. "Just watch, me, sonny boy!" Of course the kid wouldn't understand him, but screw 'im. He probably didn't understand most things anyway.</p><p>He certainly didn't understand that the world was about to end.</p><p>"Whatta haul! Whatta haul!" Happosai yelled gleefully as he bounded rapidly into the city. He would make his mark here. He would be known as the greatest sexual harasser of all time, men around the world would bow to statues in his likeness. Women would buffet him with their perky sex pillows and then send him flying in a perfect arc after a blow of exquisite feminine rage. What better way to ride out the apocalypse?</p><p>~~~~~chaos~~~~~</p><p>Ranma Ranko Nabiki Ryoga Akane Kasumi Ukyo strained against the mounting insanity. He she felt the terrible cold of Ranma Ranko Nabiki's soul of ice, the blind rage of Ryoga Akane, and the more sinister edge of the iron man's shadow. In some ways this was an improvement. Ranma Ranko Nabiki could perceive the demon now, and if he she could perceive it then maybe Ranma Ryoga Akane Ukyo could attack it. But Ranko Akane Kasumi was too distraught over the loss of the real Nabiki, and while Ranma Nabiki Ukyo was still ready to fight, Ryoga Ranko had doubts. What if what the iron man said was true? What if the real Nabiki had abandoned him her? Even Nabiki wasn't entirely sure. She wondered if maybe she was too much like the old Nabiki and the real Nabiki was now someone different, if she wasn't dead, but Ranma Ranko Nabiki Ryoga Akane Kasumi Ukyo could not accept that.</p><p>The iron man laughed again, and there was a timbre to it, that hadn't been perceptible before. A feminine lilt, an air of superiority. Another laugh, this one only from Kodachi. Then another laugh, this one from Ranma after he had asked Ukyo if she loved him. "I still got it." Iron Kodachi Ranma started jeering, "What's the matter? Too much of a girl peasant pig to attack me?" Another voice added to this cadre. "You're weak. To think that my own son could be defeated by such a slime of a man!" Genma Iron Kodachi Ranma raised his her voice "You are not a man." Kuno's voice added to the mix, "You are no man. You are a foul sorcerer trapping girls with your magic. They see themselves in you, but you never let them see who you are. Because you are nothing. You are an onion, nothing underneath all your layers, all your stolen personality traits, but an empty space where your heart should be."</p><p>The body's eyes opened. They had been clenched tightly against the turmoil. The iron-tipped stumps, where the body's hands once were, glowed red, than white. They lengthened, turning into, not hands but talons. White hot iron shot out of the body's waist, and curved down, forming Arachnid legs that raised the torso of the body up, the human legs dangling uselessly in the air.</p><p>"No!" cried Ranma Ranko Nabiki Ryoga Akane Kasumi Ukyo, "I'll never join you. I denounce you. You are not a part of me!"</p><p>But Iron Kodachi Ranma Genma Kuno chuckled. "You don't know you as well as you think you do."</p><p>~~~~~chill~~~~~</p><p>Hiro felt it as soon as he entered the large hallway. The bright crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the white marble columns, the verdant vegetation, the gurgling fountain. None of it could fit in the house he, Hoko and Genma had entered. The room was as large as a small park. Everything was perfectly visible too, as if it were daytime, but there was a palpable darkness underneath. And that chill. He had felt it before. Someone, perhaps several people, had died.</p><p>A boy in a blue hakama was cradling a girl in his arms. The girl wore a green leotard. She and the boy were covered in blood.</p><p>Saotome started running toward the scene as soon as he entered the atrium. He knelt over the largest of the two other bodies. He looked up. "Call an ambulance!" he shouted. "There might still be time!"</p><p>"Right!" Hoko chirped from behind Hiro. "I think I remember where the phone is." He didn't watch her leave. Hiro just met Genma's gaze. There wasn't time. He knew that for a fact.</p><p>~<i>I can't be dead! I have to get to Ranko, she's in trouble!~</i> The shadowy form of Tendo Nabiki stood over her own body.</p><p><i>~Nabiki! I couldn't save you. Please don't die!~ </i>Soun Tendo cried.</p><p>Hiro had, if he was honest with himself, seen ghosts before. But never of people he knew. He wanted to run away, for this not to be his problem, but he knew these people. Or at least one of them. "Tendo-chan?"</p><p>Nabiki's ghostly head turned. <i>~542? 542! Help me! I can't be dead. I have to save Ranko, she's in trouble!~</i></p><p>Genma didn't seem to hear Nabiki at all. "She looks bad. All of them look bad, though."</p><p>"I'm sorry," the teenaged boy in the hakama, Tatewaki Kuno, said.</p><p>Where was the third ghost? Three deaths, there should be three ghosts. Maybe the black haired girl was still alive? But when Hiro walked closer and lowered his sunglasses, he could see no spark within her. He raised his sunglasses quickly, lest the waiting throng of the dead notice he was vulnerable.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Kuno said again.</p><p>"Did you do this?" Hiro pointed at the boy.</p><p>Kuno gently put the girl, his sister, down on the floor and stood up. "Some of it. All of it. It is difficult for me to tell how much was fated and how much blame is truly mine, but I played a role."</p><p>Saotome stood and stepped between Hiro and Kuno "We should move them outside, closer to the road."</p><p>Hiro shook his head. "This is a crime scene, we should disturb it as little as possible."</p><p>"Do you think you're going to discover some hidden truth in all this mess? Three people are dead and the boy is the only one halfway responsible for any of it. That's all the information we require right now. We need to get the wounded close to the street in case they can be saved."</p><p>"They're dead, Saotome-san. It's too late for any of that."</p><p>Hiro saw the man deflate with a deep sigh. "You would know. It's just..."</p><p>~Officer <i>542</i>,~ Nabiki entreated ~<i>What are you doing? I can't be dead. I have to save Ranko! She's in trouble!</i>~</p><p>~<i>Nabiki, don't die! Don't die Nabiki! I couldn't save you!~</i> Soun wailed.</p><p>Hiro wasn't sure if this was sad, or annoying. "Tell me what happened," he addressed Kuno.</p><p>"I heard my sister enter the premises and when I came out to greet her I discovered she was holding hostage Tendo Nabiki and her father…" Kuno went on to relate what had happened. He was solemn if a little wordy in his descriptions. He was just explaining how he released Nabiki's father when Hoko came back.</p><p>"Okay," Hoko said as she came back into the atrium. "I called the paramedics; they should be here soon. Is everyone okay?"</p><p>"No, everyone is not okay," Genma grumbled. "Everyone is dead."</p><p>Hoko stood still. Her expression fell. "No. You said get an ambulance. That means people are still alive. That means…" She ran to one of the bodies. "Nabiki! Come on, Nabiki you can't be dead!"</p><p>~~~~~ire~~~~~</p><p>Mousse bound after Elder Cologne without really knowing why. Shampoo wasn't an Amazon anymore. He should have left as soon as he found out, but instead he stayed through the farce of Akane's recruitment and now he was following his employer in the middle of the night to help her save his rival. The whole thing didn't make sense. It pissed him off.</p><p>He just didn't know what to do. At the moment he had a job and a place to stay. He would have to find some other way to get those if he left Cologne. Furthermore, while before winning Shampoo's affection involved a fairly simple plan of beating her in combat, now things would be more complicated. He would have to woo her somehow. And that was going to be hard enough without being homeless and unemployed.</p><p>For the moment at least, until he could figure out some strategy, he was stuck doing what the old hag told him to. He didn't have to put any effort in it though.</p><p>When they arrived at the Tendo residence, Mousse saw Ranma in his female form, only he had eight black spider legs coming out of his torso and his arms ended in oversized hands with sharp looking claws at the end of each digit. Ranma's eyes were completely black, and looked larger than normal. The sight disgusted Mousse. This was his competition? This freak? He jumped into position and threw out chains from his sleeves.</p><p>Cologne turned around and warned, "No, Mousse!"</p><p>But it was too late. The chains wrapped around Ranma's body true enough. But Ranma, or rather the creature who used to be Ranma laughed. It was a terrible laugh. A screaming metal on metal sound that held such contempt and evil that Mousse took a step back.</p><p>He should have stepped back more. He should have let go, turned around and ran away. Because in moments the metal of the chains began glowing red. Mousse tried to release the chains but he wasn't fast enough. They were long and a good portion of them was still in nullspace, and the only way into reality for the chains was the pocket of Mousse's robe. The glow spread down the chains with supernatural speed, and his arms burned. He yelped in pain.</p><p>The pain didn't stop though. It got worse. So much worse, and so suddenly, that Mouse fell to the ground, screaming.</p><p><i>You like the pain, don't you, duck boy? </i></p><p>What? Mousse struggled to get free of the burning chains but every movement brought more hurt.</p><p><i>That's why you pursue Shampoo. That's why you stayed with the old hag. You like the way they treat you, you like being used.</i></p><p>"No! That's not true! Get off me, Saotome. You win alright? Arrgh!" A new wave of burning pain passed through Mousse. All the way through him. It seemed to carry something unclean as well.</p><p><i>I can use you. You can be my plaything, duckie. You can be my death doll.</i></p><p>The metal of the chains was melting, wrapping around Mousses arms, dragging him closer to the monster Ranma had become. Then a splash of water and Mousse was a duck. His wings were burned, he could not fly, so he waddled away as fast as he could toward Cologne, who was holding a garden hose in her hand, water still pouring out of the end.</p><p>Mousse had never been so scared before. He felt weak getting rescued by elder Cologne. Weak, but grateful nonetheless. The feeling didn't last for long before Cologne picked him up and jumped away from the now white hot chains that Ranma was whipping around toward the both of them.</p><p>When Cologne was still for long enough, Mousse used his supple duck's neck to examine himself. It was then that he found the thin band of black metal wrapped around the bone of his right wing.</p><p>~~~~~death~~~~~</p><p>"I didn't come all the way over here just for you to die on me! Get up! You CAN'T be dead!"</p><p>~<i>I can't be dead!~</i> Nabiki agreed.</p><p>Hoko nudged her friend with her hand. The body had apparently not yet gone through rigor mortis. Hiro found the whole thing rather macabre. "Hoko, she's gone. Or, at least, she's not where you're looking."</p><p>"You see her, don't you?" Hoko accused.</p><p>"Yes, she keeps saying that she can't be dead and that she has to save Ranko."</p><p>"What's wrong with Ranma?" Saotome was apparently not surprised at all that Hiro could see dead people.</p><p>Hiro shrugged. "I don't know. Maybe nothing."</p><p><i>~Officer 542, I can't be dead!~</i></p><p>"Can't you say something else? I can't help you right now. I don't know how."</p><p>~<i>Ranko needs help! Iron man!~</i></p><p>"She just said something about an Iron man."</p><p>Genma's face turned a whiter shade of pale. "Let me borrow one of your motorcycles. I need to go. Now."</p><p>"Take Hiro's." Hoko said in a monotone. She glanced at Hiro.</p><p>Hiro sighed and threw the man his keys. At the rate the night was going, Saotome was liable to find his son or daughter or whatever either dead or killing people. It almost wasn't worth the effort.</p><p>"Wait." The voice came from Kuno. "I cannot permit more death this night. I will travel with thee, elder Saotome."</p><p>"Haven't you and your sister done enough damage?" Saotome scowled.</p><p>"My sister was a victim of sorcery. She was not to blame in this debacle. The woman posing as Tendo Nabiki was a kitsune, and she worked trickery to make my sister attack the Tendo patriarch. Thankfully I dispatched her before she could work further mischief, although I was not able to save my fair sister."</p><p>Hiro held up a hand. "Let me get this straight. Your sister attacked and killed Soun Tendo under some magical influence from Nabiki. Then Nabiki attacked your sister, and you killed her, but not before she killed your sister?"</p><p>"Verily thou hast the right of it, though there are some differences in how I would tell the tale."</p><p>"And you expect me to let you out of my sight?"</p><p>Saotome put a restraining hand on Hiro's chest."This is a matter between martial artists. The boy lost his sister, I lost my best friend and his daughter, who was like a niece to me. The correct thing to do here is to mourn and then have a duel. A battle to the death. "</p><p>"You're insane! That just increases the problem!"</p><p>Genma shook his head. "If you look at a picture too closely, sometimes you fail to see it. That boy deserves to die for what he did and what he allowed his sister to do. I deserve to die for letting any of it to happen to begin with. The truly honorable thing would be for both of us to kill ourselves right now. But if we have a duel, then at least one of us gets to live."</p><p>"This should be decided by a court of law."</p><p>"And what would a court do? Kill the boy? Throw him in jail? Maybe they would throw me in jail for negligence. But we could both easily escape. And that boy does not deserve to die like a dog. He will die by my hand in combat, or not at all."</p><p>"I like your thinking, Saotome-san, though I would prefer you to refrain from referring to me as 'that boy'. We will do battle to the death, but at some other time. At the moment we both share a concern for the pigtailed girl and so we should enact a momentary truce."</p><p>Saotome nodded. "I don't like it, but I might need the help. I suppose you can ride with me."</p><p>"Hold on a second, here. I didn't say either of you could leave!" Hiro yelled.</p><p>"We don't need your permission," Saotome said and bound away far from Hiro's reach. The Kuno boy running right after him. Hiro considered his pistol for one second, but discarded the idea the next. There was no way he'd be able to get a bead on them, and he really didn't want to shoot either of them, at least not fatally, until he was sure of what happened and who was responsible.</p><p>Hoko nudged Hiro with her elbow."I guess you should have thought things through a bit before you threw Mr. Saotome your keys, huh?"</p><p>"I guess." Hiro felt like a complete cad. He might as well have stayed home for all the good he was doing here. Completely worthless. Then he noticed something. Hoko didn't seem so distraught. In fact she looked almost excited. "Why aren't you more upset?"</p><p>"I'm just happy I'm finally going to be able to repay Nabiki for everything she's done for me."</p><p>"How do you figure?"</p><p>Hoko tilted her head. "What's up with you, Hiro-kun? You were on board when I called you, you almost beat me driving here, now you got this ennui thing going."</p><p>"There's nothing we can do, Hoko-chan. Your friend is dead, her father is dead, and the Kuno girl, she's even deader than most dead people. We were too late. We failed. All that's left is the clean up, and I even screwed that up."</p><p>Hoko put a hand on each of Hiro's shoulders and looked up into his eyes. "Hiro, get your act together! You're a fucking necromancer! Necromance Nabiki back into her body already!"</p><p>Hiro blinked a few times. Despite having a full view of two ghosts for the past ten minutes or so, he had forgotten about his "gift." But so he was a necromancer. So what? "It doesn't work like that."</p><p>"And why the hell doesn't it work like that?"</p><p>"I…I don't know. I can see ghosts, and they can communicate with me, but that's about it. Besides, what with Nabiki's body approaching room temperature and minus a great deal of blood I don't see how forcing her soul back into it, even supposing I could figure out how to do something like that, would be anything other than uncomfortable for all concerned."</p><p><i>~I can't be dead!~</i> Nabiki protested.</p><p>"Hmm…Maybe I might be able to do something about that." Hoko turned away. "Don't look!"</p><p>Hiro frowned, shrugged, and turned away.</p><p>"Alright you can look now."</p><p>Hiro turned back around. Hoko seemed to be holding something in her hand, but Hiro couldn't see what it was. She stared at it for a while, then she shrugged went to Nabiki and put whatever it was in the dead girls mouth. At first nothing happened. Then there was a bright flash of light and heat, and when that subsided Hiro could see Nabiki's chest rise and fall. She was breathing! "What did you do?"</p><p>Hoko smiled, "Years of playing video games finally paid off!"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Phoenix down," Hoko said as if that explained everything. "I guess it's a good thing I don't shave my pubes."</p><p>~~~~~End of Chapter 12~~~~~</p><p>2/11/09</p><p>Hope you enjoyed.
