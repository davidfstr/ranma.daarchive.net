</div><p style="text-align:center;">Thyself Known</p><p>By Zorknot</p><p>DISCLAIMER: Timmy was really looking forward to school today. His first day as a human! He wondered what sorts of things Earth teachers taught human children. He had been studying his viruses, but he didn't know if that would be any help. Human children probably learned more practical things like reciting digits of pi or hopscotch. Timmy found his desk and sat down. Curiously some previous student had carved words painstakingly into the wood of the desk. The words said "This is a fanfiction of the manga/anime Ranma ½ by Rumiko Takahashi. Many of the characters and situations belong to her and the various corporations she is affiliated with. If you have not bought the manga or anime, please do so to give proper credit where it is due."</p><p>Ch.13: Purification</p><p>"<i>Power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it. Eventually, they lose touch with reality... and fall."</i></p><p>-Frank Herbert fr. God Emperor of Dune</p><p>~~~~~siege~~~~~</p><p>[12:30 am, Tokyo, Japan]</p><p>"Okay, Cologne's holding off Ranma for now, but we don't have much time." Tofu turned back toward his love.</p><p>"You think she'll attack us?" Kasumi asked, sounding surprised.</p><p>"It's a possibility. We don't know what we're dealing with really. A serial killer melded with all the dark aspects of Ranma's psyche? It could be that he wouldn't attack here because this is his home, but then he might attack this place especially for that very reason." Tofu walked through Kasumi's delicate scent into the kitchen. "How much salt do you have?"</p><p>"1 3-kilo bag"</p><p>"Okay one bag is what, about 9,000 cubic centimeters? And Ranma is about as big as the living room right now, so that's a diameter of about…"</p><p>"Ten meters. Are you really going to attempt an exorcism?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"I don't see any other way, Kasumi-chan. Ten meters…That gives a circumference of around 31.4 meters or 3,140 centimeters…"</p><p>"You should have enough, Ono-kun. Five centimeters thick, five millimeters thick brings you to a little over 7,500 cubic centimeters. As long as you don't drop the bag. As long as you don't get killed."</p><p>Tofu found the salt and held it in the crook of his arm. "I won't." He gave Kasumi a brief kiss before he could think better of it.</p><p>The next thing he knew he was watching his love hurriedly sweep the mound of salt on the kitchen floor into a dustbin and then empty it into a bucket. His hands were clenched around the ruined bag. "I'm sorry Kasumi-chan, I…"</p><p>Tofu watched in horror as Kasumi headed outside with the bucket of salt. "Kasumi! What are you doing?"</p><p>"Ono-kun, you're the only one here who can perform the ceremony. Someone has to distract Ranko. She is very...emotional right now."</p><p>"Kasumi, she…he…Ranma's dangerous!"</p><p>"She is not Ranma right now. She's Ranko. She's my little sister."</p><p>"She's my daughter." Tofu and Kasumi turned to see Nodoka in the doorway.</p><p>Tofu blinked. "I thought you didn't know…?"</p><p>Nodoka seemed to swallow something bitter before saying "What's to know? I plan on adopting her as soon as possible. She has been too long with out a proper parent."</p><p>Tofu nodded slowly. Nodoka knew more than she let on, but now was not the time for revelations, except, perhaps in the biblical sense. "No offence, Saotome-san, but you may do more harm than good. For reasons I can't go into right now, Ran…ko fears you. She may even hate you a little. Normally she'd keep those things to herself, but she's not herself right now."</p><p>"Saotome-san would cause her too much distress," Kasumi agreed, "Nabiki is missing." Kasumi swallowed and straightened. "I'm only doing the proper thing." With that, she rushed outside into the chaos.</p><p>~~~~~rice-a-roni~~~~~~~</p><p>[7:30 AM San Francisco, USA]</p><p>Happosai bounded across the tops of buildings, bolstered for a little while by the adrenaline from his latest caper. Problem was no one was chasing him. Hardly anyone registered his appearance. The whole city seemed rather unimpressed. Morning tends to do that to a city. It wakes up, shakes off the dew of the previous night's activities and starts trudging along again, completely unaware of whatever else might be going on. Happosai ended up stopping by the bay on a small rocky outcropping a little bit a way from the road. He looked at the fog coalescing about the Golden Gate Bridge in the morning sun and lit his pipe. It really was quite beautiful, he thought blowing out a puff of smoke. Something about rise and fall of the bridge's lines rising out of the mist reminded him of the Bayankala mountains. Of Cologne when she was still beautiful, of himself when he was just as beautiful if not more so. Beautiful and stupid.</p><p>A lot like Ranma actually. Sure he was driven more by his libido while Ranma was driven by a desire to be a man among men, but Ranma was making the same mistakes. The boy was trying so hard to be a man, but in all the wrong areas. If he had just given up at Jusenkyo, if he could have just accepted that things were the way they were. If he could have just faced his goddamned mother instead of trying to do the impossible, none of this would be happening. You don't become a man by trying to be more male, but by being mature. You can only suppress Yin so long before it lashes back out at you. You can only grip Yang so tightly before it begins to pass away from you like sand from a clenched fist.</p><p>Happosai wondered if anyone from Nerima would be surprised to learn that as old as he was, he was still a virgin.</p><p>He let out a loud percussive HA! at that. They would probably be more upset at the idea of him ever having sex. It would never happen now of course. All because of that stupid scroll and Cologne's fickle heart.</p><p>Happosai found he had made an image of Cologne with his smoke. Cologne as she was, so beautiful, so unattainable. He had been too weak to defeat her. His father had trained him as a professional thief, a low grade spy for the Nyuchezu village. He could hide and escape from people easily enough and if there was something that needed filching he could filch it, but these were not a warrior's skills.</p><p>He had been very handsome back then. Many of the other women of the tribe would try to arrange for him to defeat them by accident. But avoiding accidental marriages is something amazon males are taught early in life, and Happosai was not interested in anyone other than Cologne.</p><p>Then he had heard of the secret scroll. The scroll that held a technique that allowed you to trade beauty for power.</p><p><i>Stealing the scroll is not an easy task. Hapu Sai spends a week mulling it over, considering his plans and wondering if it is worth it. The day before the heist, he visits Ku Lon and asks her yet again if she will marry him.</i></p><p><i>She says no of course, as she has countless times before.</i></p><p><i>"You are very beautiful, and charming," she says, "but you are weak. Perhaps some women wouldn't mind that, but it is very important to me that my children be strong warriors like me and my ancestors before me. I will not marry a weakling or a coward and I know your profession. You are both."</i></p><p><i>"Suppose I could be stronger, would you marry me then?" Hapu Sai asks.</i></p><p><i>Ku Lon tilts her head in thought. Then she smiles. "Yes. Get stronger. You don't have to defeat me truly, just land a single true blow, and I will marry you."</i></p><p><i>Of course Hapu Sai ignores this last bit. He remembers it later the same way that you think of come backs to insults years after they should have been forgotten, but now he only wants a sort of blessing to do what he is about to do. He should train. He should get stronger the usual way and challenge Ku Lon properly. But he is stupid.</i></p><p><i>He asks, "What if I became ugly, but much stronger. What about then?"</i></p><p><i>Ku Lon's brow crinkles ever so slightly into the cutest of frowns. "I think I would still marry you. Besides if you defeated , then I would be honor bound to marry you anyway wouldn't I? I like you well enough it wouldn't be hard for me."</i></p><p>And that was all Happosai had needed. Without saying another word he had left Cologne and put his plan into action. In retrospect, Cologne had probably had been thinking of Happosai's graceful features marred with scars, or his nose broken into a distorted shape. Something that in some eyes would be an improvement. She had probably never considered that Happosai would return to her as an absurdly small little bean of a man with immense amounts of raw power at his command.</p><p>As different as he looked, there was still no doubt it was he that stole the scroll. He was reviled by the entire village. They could not capture him or even banish him, as he was far too quick for them, but Cologne would have nothing to do with him anymore. She would not even talk with him as a friend. And of course he had little chance with any other woman.</p><p>Happosai shook his head and waved his hand through the smoky visage of Cologne. He had already gotten revenge for what she had done to him. Even if, in his heart, he knew that it was all his own doing.</p><p>He sighed. The fog was showing the first signs of clearing: an errant gust of wind cutting through the clouds. If he waited longer, Happosai might have been able to see the bridge bathed in full sunlight, but he had some necessities to take care of. He hefted his bag of treasures back onto his back and bounded into the city looking for a suitable source of feminine ki.</p><p>~~~~~pubes~~~~~</p><p>[12:30 AM Toyko, Japan]</p><p>Hiro blinked, at Hoko's…disturbing…resurrection technique, filed it all under "information to freak out about later" and crouched to inspect Nabiki's body more closely. The wound was still there on Nabiki's neck, but it looked cauterized now. She looked anemic from blood loss, but stable.</p><p>~<i>I need to save Ranko.~</i> Ghost Nabiki informed him.</p><p>It was odd how Hiro never had put it together before that ghosts were stupid. He had always been too weirded out about them to really pay attention. "Look, Nabiki," He said in tones one might use to calm a petulant child, "It's your body! It's ready for you now. You can save Ranko all you want once you're inside it. "</p><p>~<i>I can't be dead!~</i></p><p>"I know, Nabiki. And you <i>won't</i> be dead, just so long as you climb back in your nice comfy skin. Come on now, that's it…" And then Hiro did something extremely, utterly, insanely stupid.</p><p>He reached for Nabiki's ghost with his hand.</p><p>One second he was realizing this might not be the best of ideas, the next he wasn't realizing much at all. Then his eyes fluttered open. He felt weak. His neck hurt. He…wasn't a he.</p><p>Hoko's concerned face entered his field of vision. "Nabiki?"</p><p>"Gods DAMN it!" Hiro grumbled in Nabiki's voice.</p><p>"Um…That would be me." Nabiki said in Hiro's voice. Well at least Nabiki was alive, and not repeating the same things over and over again. "Is this permanent?" He/she asked.</p><p>"Oh I hope the fuck not." Hiro said, pulling Nabiki's body into a sitting position. Nabiki's body wanted very much to vomit, and Hiro wasn't sure how long he could placate it before complying. "I thought I was done with all this girl shit."</p><p>"There's a story there I'm definitely going to want to hear sometime when nobody's life is in danger. Hoko? Is that you?"</p><p>"Yep! Surprise! I'm alive!" Hoko rushed to embrace her friend. Was it insane to be jealous of his body getting her attentions without him in it? Maybe. But it was his girlfriend and his body and he was well on his way from simply being annoyed by Nabiki, to outright loathing her. How could he have ever found her attractive?</p><p>"I thought…I thought I killed you." Nabiki frowned with Hiro's face.</p><p>"That was Copycat, Nabiki, not you. You have his memories from when he was using your body that's all. You're not a killer."</p><p>Nabiki pulled away from Hoko. Hiro followed her gaze to Kodachi. "I am now."</p><p>Hiro looked back at his stolen body. So Nabiki killed Kodachi. This could cause some problems.</p><p>" I've never felt so out of control before." And there was a flash of neon green the moment Nabiki said the word "control". A flash of green that never quite left the eyes.</p><p>Hiro wanted to arrest her, to have her go to trial for her crimes. But he wasn't sure how to go about doing that. Especially considering he was in her body at the moment.</p><p>"Well, hey, you're alive, right?" Hoko punched Nabiki-in-Hiro's-body lightly in the shoulder</p><p>"It seems that way." Nabiki looked over the bodies. Hiro watched the now green eyes of his body widen at the sight of Soun Tendo's body. Nabiki approached her father slowly and knelt next to him. "He's dead, isn't he."</p><p>"Yes," Hiro attempted to stand, thought better of it, and managed a kneel. "Though being dead isn't as permanent a condition as it was a few minutes ago as it turns out." Hiro could see the shadowy form of Soun Tendo standing near his body.</p><p><i>~She's made it. She's alive. I can go now~</i></p><p>"Actually, wait…Hoko, you need to do your thing quickly. I think Tendo-san might be a flight risk."</p><p>Hoko nodded. She looked at her hand. "I still have some from before."</p><p>Nabiki stood. "Hoko, let me clarify something, because I've kind of had a long day. You can bring people back to life?"</p><p>Hoko shook her head. "I can bring their bodies back to life. Hiro apparently has to guide their souls back to their bodies."</p><p>"Since when exactly were you able to do this?"</p><p>~<i>She's alive. I can go. It's okay now~</i></p><p>Hiro groaned, though he didn't like how it sounded coming out of Nabiki's throat. "We don't have time for this. She's part phoenix, she awakened to her powers when she died. I've been a necromancer for a while longer, but I've been in denial. Together, apparently, we can make zombies happen, though it's a bit more Wes Craven than George Romero."</p><p>Hoko raised her hand as if she were in class. "You mean that movie about serpents and rainbows that doesn't have any serpents or rainbows in it?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"That pissed me off. I mean I thought I was going to be watching some big budget American fantasy movie, you know something about a sea serpent and a magical rainbow bridge?...And instead I got that boring shlock. "</p><p>"Hoko? Focus?" Hiro gestured to Nabiki's father. Then he realized she couldn't <i>see</i> Nabiki's father, so he gestured to Nabiki's father's body instead. Unfortunately this made him look at Nabiki's hands, which were not at all like his hands. He tried to put them out of his line of sight by crossing his arms but this just called attention to how delicate Nabiki's arms were and how thin her torso was. Hiro wanted hit something or bellow out in frustration. He bit it back though, because it would only come out as a girlish scream, which would make him feel even worse.</p><p>Hoko's eyes found Soun's body, and she straightened. "Right. I'm sorry, it's just that movie left a gaping hole where two hours of my life used to be." Hoko knelt next to the corps and inserted her "down" into Soun's mouth. The same light show that occurred with Nabiki happened again, and Soun started breathing. "In science class, the teacher showed us a prism? And instead of thinking 'Oh look at all the colors!' I was like 'Hey that rainbow reminds me of this crappy American movie I saw where nothing interesting happened.'"</p><p>Nabiki frowned. "Hoko, what did you put in my father's mouth?"</p><p>Hoko rubbed her arms with her hands nervously. "You know, it's really less disturbing if I don't tell you."</p><p>Hoko's movement made Hiro realize that he was cold. All Nabiki's body was wearing was a men's brown gi, boxers and a t-shirt all of which was at least two sizes too large. Aside from hanging off of the body in ways that made parts of the anatomy uncomfortably obvious for Hiro, it also let the cool autumn air in. "I thought you could turn into a man now or something." Hiro grumbled as he forced Nabiki's body to stand. Colored lights colored his vision. He had to guide Soun back into his body, but Nabiki's body was still extremely weak.</p><p>"I could," Nabiki seemed to be thinking about what Hiro said, "but I don't think I can anymore. I mean, I guess I'm a man now, but I don't think I could change forms if I was still in my body." Nabiki closed her green eyes. "Shit. Ranma trusted me with his manhood, with everything that made him who he was, and what did I do? I got a fucking panic attack and burned it all away. I can't even feel him anymore. Do you feel him at all Kawagami-chan?"</p><p>"No." Hiro was a little preoccupied with not passing out.</p><p>Nabiki let out a growl of frustration. "Look, do you need me here, to save my father and Kodachi? I need to-"</p><p>"See Ranko. Yes, I know." Hiro made Nabiki's body take several deep breaths in an attempt to get more oxygen to the brain. "How are you going to get to him…ah…her though? Mr. Saotome took my motorcycle and I don't think Hoko will let you use hers."</p><p>"Why wouldn't she? She's let me borrow it before. It's okay, right, Hoko?"</p><p>"No, Nabiki. It's not." Hoko's expression was suddenly serious. "No one is riding my bike but me and whoever rides with me. It's the new 'no one fucks with Hoko's shit' rule. I can drive you over there and drop you off, but I've got to be driving."</p><p>"And while I don't need you, I do need Hoko-chan." Hiro was a little worried about Kodachi's ghost not being anywhere around and Soun seemed to be giving up the ghost in a distressingly literal sense.</p><p>"It's good to be needed." Hoko smiled brightly. "Couldn't I just drop her off and come back though?"</p><p>Hiro eyed Soun. ~<i>She's alive. I've done all I can. I'm tired. I'm ready to see my wife now~</i> The man's spiritual body grew sporadically dimmer, like a candle just before the wax runs out .</p><p>Answering Hoko, Hiro shook Nabiki's head. "We don't have time for that. Nabiki, your father's fading fast. You need to keep him here or I won't be able to help him."</p><p>Nabiki was silent for a moment. "What can I do about it?" she asked finally.</p><p>"Tell him you need him. Tell him why he has to stay."</p><p>Nabiki just stood there, motionless and silent, her eyes fixed at some point on the ground..</p><p>"Say something, Nabiki, there isn't much time."</p><p>"I can't. I can't say something like that and mean it. Do I love him? Yes. But do I need him?" Nabiki's eyes met Hiro's. "No. I don't need him. Not anymore." Nabiki looked toward the exit. "Come on, Hoko. We better get going."</p><p>Hoko looked uncertain.</p><p>Hiro saw Soun's ghost flicker almost out of existence, and he felt panic rise within him. "Nabiki! Whatever you have against your father it's not worth it. He's leaving. He's losing the will to live. Maybe you don't need him but you got to say you do. Just say it, otherwise it will be like you're killing him!"</p><p>Nabiki paused," All those times I needed a father, he wasn't there. I provided for our family. I kept us off the streets. All he did in all that time was sulk." Nabiki continued toward Hoko's motorcycle. "Besides, there isn't time."</p><p>Hiro tried to make Nabiki's body stand but it just collapsed. He let out a growl of frustration which sounded jarringly feminine coming out of Nabiki's throat. "You're killing him, Nabiki! I can't get to him right now. I need to guide him to his body. I just need a minute, damn it, and I can save him. Just come back here and lie to him for a minute and then you can go off and save your worthless fiancée."</p><p>Hoko moved to block Nabiki's path. "Hiro has a point, don't you think?"</p><p>"I can't!" Nabiki yelled. "I told you already I can't!"</p><p>"Just say something to him, just say how you feel."</p><p>"Daddy." Nabiki turned slowly and addressed the air, looking up and around as if watching out for bats. "I love you. But let's face it, you've been dead a long time. All you've ever wanted to do is see mom again. Well here's your chance. Either let her go, and be a father again, or leave us and be with her. It doesn't matter to me. I had to let you go a long time ago."</p><p>How could she say that? Didn't she know her father was going to die for real?</p><p>~<i>I need her, Nabiki. You don't need me, but I need her.~</i> Soun's ghost grew dimmer, flickering wildly now.</p><p>Hiro crawled closer to Soun, but he was still too far away. He wasn't going to make it. Damn it! He was in Nabiki's body, maybe he could do something. "Daddy!" he called out to the fading figure of Soun. "Daddy! Don't leave, I need you!"</p><p>~<i>I've waited so long. I'm ready to see my wife now. I'm ready to be with my Kimiko~</i></p><p>Soun's ghost faded further, until he was just a slightly discolored patch of air. Then, he was gone. His body filled with air one last time and then grew still again.</p><p>"He's dead." Hiro said the words not to Nabiki or anyone else, but to himself. Soun was not his father, he barely knew him, but being in Nabiki's body, forced to see things from her perspective, as Soun slipped away was too much. He had learned CPR, became a cop, he had even became a freaking necromancer, and yet still nothing changed. He couldn't save Soun. Just like he couldn't save his own father so many years ago. Just like before, he was forced to watch as a life slipped away in front of him. The only difference was that now he could see it happen even more clearly. He sat up and addressed Nabiki. "Give me back my body, Tendo."</p><p>"No. I won't. I don't even know how if I wanted to, and my body is too weak. I need to see Ranko as soon as possible."</p><p>Hiro growled through gasping breaths "Give me back…my body… you fucking whore!"</p><p>Nabiki rolled her eyes. "Come on, Hoko, let's leave before he gets even more impolite." Nabiki made hand movements toward the exit.</p><p>Hoko remained where she was. "Nabiki, I think you should give Hiro back his body."</p><p>"We don't have time for this!" Nabiki threw up her hands. "Ranko is very weak right now. I'm supposed to be able to feel her, but I can't. She could be in serious trouble. I just need to make sure she's okay and THEN I'll come back and give back Hiro's body."</p><p>"Tendo" Hiro growled, " I have saved your life. Twice. What have you done for me? You've fucked some other guy in front of my face and now you've stolen my body from me. You know who else stole my body from me? Copycat. And I would have sworn the next time anybody did that to me I would have killed him. I don't know where I got it in my head that you had some element of human decency. But it's blatantly obvious now that you don't, and if I had known that before I would have let you rot."</p><p>"Look, I'm sorry about all this, but let me be perfectly clear here." Nabiki's eyes glowed green in Hiro's face. "Ranko is the most important thing to me in my life right now. There is no way either of you is going to stop me."</p><p>Rage kept building up in Hiro. Rage that he hadn't felt since he had punched that murderer back when he worked homicide. Nabiki had some fancy power now, with that green aura of hers, but he had a power too. All he had to do was embrace it. "I am a necromancer." Hiro made Nabiki's body step forward. He also made his own body step forward. Nabiki's eyes widened in astonishment. "I have raised you from the dead. You are my minion. I own you."</p><p>"Nobody owns me!" Nabiki was suddenly enveloped in green, but just as suddenly the aura winked out.</p><p>Hiro felt his eyes burning. He could see now a pale blue line connecting him to Nabiki. There was another, fainter one connecting him to Hoko, but he ignored this one. He pulled on Nabiki's line and she jerked forward. "You will not attempt to fight me again. You will walk toward me, and then you will give me back my body."</p><p>Nabiki walked jerkily along the blue line connecting her to Hiro. When she was finally next to him he raised Nabiki's hand and his hand, both of which were glowing faintly blue. He made them touch. There was a moment of disorientation and he was back in his own body, looking down at Nabiki who collapsed to the ground after the switch. As Hiro watched, a mark appeared on Nabiki's forehead. It made him smile. It was the kanji for "not" as in "not dead."</p><p>"Okay," Hoko spoke into the silence. "I guess that could have gone better."</p><p>~~~~~panda on a motorcycle~~~~~</p><p>Paws weren't the best appendages with which to operate a motor vehicle, but an inevitable puddle on the way to the Tendo residence made dealing with them a necessity for Genma.</p><p>"What manner of witchery is this?" Kuno demanded from behind him. With some awkward maneuvering Genma was able to slow down the motorcycle and aim it at an inconspicuous looking curb side. He fell on his side, the fur of his shoulder and leg skidding on the asphalt. The bike continued on into the green concrete pylons that adorned the curb. Thankfully, Genma did not live in a stylized action movie, and so the motorcycle did not explode into an enormous ball of flames. At least, not yet.</p><p>Genma clambered up to his hind legs and limped over to the bike to see the damage and to see if he could still walk. The motorcycle seemed okay for the most part, and his leg wasn't too bad. The fur had helped cushion the impact.</p><p>Tatewake was still picking himself from the ground. "Now is not the time for these tedious ninja tricks, Saotome-san. I know not how you procured a panda to exchange yourself with, but your tactic is pointless. I will simply take the conveyance myself and get to my love before you. "</p><p>Genma felt a curious pressure. As if the air were suddenly viscous. As if his thoughts were momentarily refracted like light into a pool of water. He drew a sign out of null space, calling upon the minor demon all practitioners of hidden weapons techniques paid fealty to. Not as powerful or as dangerous as the Tendo demon. Just a mindless extradimensional being that would store things as long as it was properly fed. Of course if it wasn't properly fed it would eventually consume Genma, but he would get plenty of warning before that happened. His sign read, "It's a curse nitwit!" He turned it around. "I turn into a panda with cold water."</p><p>"I don't know now what manner of jest this is, but if you are laughing, you are the only one doing so." Kuno spoke to the empty street around him, not to Genma.</p><p>Genma felt the pressure again. The boy was denying the obvious, and his demon was getting more powerful. At the moment, too many things depended on Genma being a cursed man rather than a panda that was used as a decoy in a kawarimi maneuver. It was too difficult to change that one thing without changing so many other things. But the boy was distraught, and the demon seemed to be getting strength from that.</p><p>This was not an ideal situation.</p><p>"These are dire times, my sister has been killed, I refuse to be subjected to this any longer." Tatewaki strode to the motorcycle. Genma moved to block his path.</p><p>If unchecked, the Kuno demon might just convince reality that Genma was never anything other than a panda. And then Nodoka would have never known him, Ranma would not exist…and the ijuu would never have started up again.</p><p>Maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing.</p><p>Genma felt the universe press in on him tighter, trying to squeeze him into a new shape. <i>No. I must exist. For my family, for myself. This reality is the one I must fight for. </i></p><p>Reality eased its pressure. <i>Damn it!</i> It had been too close that time.</p><p>The boy was too dangerous.</p><p>Genma pulled a hot kettle of water from null space. The more motile or dynamic an object, the more energy it took to store. Taking into account all the different movements going on within it at any one time, hot water was incredibly complicated. He'd have to feed the hidden weapons demon a lot more than usual to store another kettle after this, but this was necessary.</p><p>He had to convince Tatewaki of the way things really were, something not even the silver tongued Nabiki could do. Genma wasn't that good at talking to people even before his curse, but he had to try.</p><p>He had convince the boy, because otherwise he would have to kill him.</p><p>~~~~~grains of salt~~~~~</p><p>Kasumi knew this wasn't going to work. But that was precisely why she was doing it. She tipped the bucket of salt to start making the line, not sure whether she should try to ignore the sight of the monster Ranma had become attacking the Amazon matriarch as she somersaulted and parried each blow. The old woman was getting tired…but Kasumi was pouring salt in a line right now and it was rude to stare wasn't it?</p><p>She had to pour just the right amount. Some of the salt might have been lost when Ono ripped the bag and there was really only just enough to make one circle. Too much of a pile in one place and it could be ruined. Just like baking really.</p><p>Almost half a meter done. Cologne was doing a great job of providing a distraction. It was a shame that Kasumi never got a chance to really talk with the woman. She probably had hundreds of interesting stories. Those were the happiest moments that Kasumi could remember in her life. Family and friends, gathered around a table, telling stories. In Ono's clinic only two days ago, Kasumi had been able to do that with Ranma and Nabiki. Earlier tonight she had had a wonderful conversation with Mrs. Saotome, and Ono. She wanted to have more conversations like that.</p><p>It wasn't fair.</p><p>Kasumi swallowed, and felt hot tears well up in her eyes. She blinked them away. There was a superstition. Spilled salt was bad luck. A curse. You had to cry enough tears to dissolve all the salt that was spilled in order to be free of it.</p><p>A full meter now. One thirtieth the way around, but then Kasumi already knew this was hopeless. She kept going though. Not out of faith. Not really. It wasn't even optimism if she was honest. She knew this moment would come as soon as she swore to be Ranko and Ranma's sister. There was no avoiding it. But still, it was nice to think that there was still a chance. It was just nicer to see the good part of things. For instance, look how Ranko absorbed Airanman! She won! She didn't realize it, but she had infected the being who sought to infect her. What was happening now was a desperation move. A self destruct mechanism. Ranko was a hero!</p><p>So the fact that Ranko and the demon were no longer separable, and so an exorcism would probably kill her, even supposing Kasumi could make it all the way around Ranko without her noticing, wasn't what was making her sad. She knew that it wasn't going to work. Just like she knew that Ranko wasn't going to die, that she would regain her male body and that as Ranma she would be happy again… just as long as she did what she had to. Just as long as she made the right decision.</p><p><i>Kasumi has been visiting Shuuichi at the Kusoaru house every day for a month now. The frail boy always smiling when she enters his room. Always drawing pictures of flowers, birds, seascapes with masted ships in the horizon. Pictures also of a strange ethereal being of light. Pictures that at first seem like random faint lines on the paper, but that resolve into a face, a body, long thin arms.</i></p><p><i>Shuuichi is dying. He is Kasumi's best friend. Sometimes when she sees him he enters a coughing fit that lasts for an hour. Sometimes it's so bad that Kasumi can't help but cry. She can't do anything about it. She promises the boy that one day she'll become a doctor so she could cure him.</i></p><p><i>The boy smiles at this. "You're right. You're gonna be a doctor some day. But you won't be able to cure me. I'm dying tomorrow."</i></p><p><i>"What? You shouldn't say that! How could you know that?"</i></p><p><i>"She tells me things when it gets bad." The boy nods to one of his drawings of the ethereal lady. "She says that what you're doing now is more important. Being there for people, even when it's hard. That's more important than trying to keep them alive."</i></p><p><i>Kasumi is nine years old. She says, "That's stupid! If you're dead how can I be there for you?"</i></p><p>Three meters. One tenth around the circle. Kasumi knew this was going to happen, but she didn't know WHEN it would happen. She thought she still had a few days. Maybe a week, before Nabiki and Ranko/Ranma were separated and Ranko was overcome. That was the distressing thing about knowing the future. It was like walking with one's eyes closed, knowing any minute there would be a wall, or a cliff. Maybe Aurora was wrong this time, maybe the exorcism would take place and Ranko would be free of the demon's remnants. Maybe Kasumi wouldn't have to do what Aurora had shown her time and time again over the years.</p><p>But Aurora hadn't been wrong yet</p><p><i>Aurora first appears to Kasumi at Shuuichi Kusoaru's funeral. The adults are consoling each other, saying things like it's terrible that they only see each other when something like this happens. That they should get in touch afterwards. "They won't." A vague outline of light, a mere impression of a female form sits on a window sill, blending in with the dappling of the sun through the curtain. "There will be more funerals. They will nod their head at each other, uncomfortable. Then they will never speak to each other again. Death is scary to most people."</i></p><p><i>Kasumi takes a step toward the light being, waiting for her to turn out to be some trick of the light, like that one time she thought she saw a ghost in her bedroom window. But the being moves like a living person. "You're not scared though, are you?" The being asks.</i></p><p><i>Kasumi shakes her head. "I don't want Shuuichi to be dead. I don't want to be dead either."</i></p><p><i>"But you stayed with him anyway. You made sure he didn't die alone. That's a very scary thing."</i></p><p><i>"Why?" Kasumi asks.</i></p><p><i>"Because it reminds people that they too will one day die."</i></p><p><i>"Oh." Kasumi looks down, then quickly looks up again to see if the being is still there. She is.</i></p><p><i>"There is going to be a lot of death soon. You will have to live through it. You are still very young, but not young enough for it not to affect you."</i></p><p><i>The statement is mostly lost on Kasumi at the time, though she remembers it later."How come I can see you now? Why couldn't I see you before?"</i></p><p><i>" Shuuichi created me. He wanted me to be there so much. He believed in me. And now you believe in me. It is enough to allow me to exist. Shuuichi used to call me Aurora, after the northern lights. You may use that name too if you wish." Aurora's voice is musical and breathy, like wind chimes before a storm.</i></p><p><i>Aurora floats from the sill to Kasumi. She is small; the place where her eyes seem to be is level with Kasumi's eyes. "You will have to make a choice now. A very serious choice. A choice someone as young as you shouldn't have to make." She bends her head to the side, " You have just watched your best friend die. You have seen how terrible that is. Are you willing to experience that again?"</i></p><p><i>"No!" Kasumi cries, shaking her head vehemently.</i></p><p><i>"Very well. I will respect your decision." Aurora recedes a little.</i></p><p><i>"But…" Kasumi wrings her hands together nervously. "If it has to happen. If someone has to die? I want to be there for them."</i></p><p><i>Aurora brightens. "Then I can help you. The future already seems less dark!"</i></p><p><i>Less dark. But still dark. Very dark indeed.</i></p><p>Almost a fourth through the circle, Aurora appeared. Kasumi knew why before the being spoke. It was time. "You know this won't work."</p><p>Kasumi nodded.</p><p>"You're stalling. Your window is closing. The brighter future is getting further away."</p><p>Kasumi grit her teeth. The metal of the bucket handle bit into her hand as she clenched it tighter.</p><p>"I don't want to die," Kasumi whispered.</p><p>"Every second of a life is a death. Every choice marks the end of one form of existence and the beginning of another. If you do not choose yourself, your choices will be made for you. And that too is a form of death." Time was slowing down. A scent of rain filled Kasumi's nostrils. It wasn't enough to calm her though. She hadn't been so scared before. She hadn't had so much to live for.</p><p>"There has to be another way." Kasumi closed her eyes not wanting to see Aurora's beautiful, vague form. But there it was still, in her vision even while she clenched her lids against it.</p><p>"Who are you, Tendo Kasumi? Are you the gentle, yet brave caregiver, the bedrock of your family, the calming hand amid a whirlwind of roiling tempers? Or, are you a poor, deluded soul, desperately holding on to an outdated sense of tradition and hiding from your pain behind pots and pans?"</p><p>Kasumi let out a breath like escaping steam. It was a scream without vocalization passed between her teeth, but she relaxed. She dropped the bucket. "I know who I am." She spoke softly, but resolutely. Aurora nodded and faded away.</p><p>Kasumi stepped toward Ranko. The white hot chain that Ranko took from Mousse flew before her in an instant. Kasumi felt it hit her arm and stomach. She was knocked down. The heat of the chain burned through her clothing.</p><p>Ranko turned. She was almost three feet taller than Kasumi's standing height with her metallic spider legs, and she seemed immense from her position on the ground. Ranko looked down at her. Kasumi was hit with a paroxysm of fear. It was something she couldn't do anything about. Something instinctual.</p><p>But it isn't our instincts that make us who we are.</p><p><i>A hospital room. Down the hall from her mother's room. Aurora has guided her here.</i></p><p><i>The young man lies in the bed, an abnormally small woman crying beside him. He is so much like Shuuichi. "What is wrong with him?" Kasumi asks. She has not yet learned tact. She is, if anything, more direct than most girls her age.</i></p><p><i>"His name is Tofuro Ono, though he likes to go by Tofu." Aurora informs her. "His father died in the Awakening. Tofu was one of the possessed." The being of light glides to Kasumi, and places a scintillating hand, or really a representation of a hand, on her shoulder. It feels slightly warm, but it makes the hairs on her neck stand up. "He is like the person who caused your mother's illness."</i></p><p><i>Kasumi didn't see the fight her mother had with the smoke demon. Her father had told the story beaming with pride, and Uncle Saotome had nodded at each event and provided commentary, almost as impressed as his friend. Her mother blushed and tried to say it wasn't a big deal. But she also coughed. And she couldn't stop coughing.</i></p><p><i>Later she found out the smoke demon had once been a firefighter. During the ijuu, he gained the ability to control smoke. When the awakening happened, he went insane from the power. Kasumi began to hate the man when her mother had to be taken to the hospital. And Aurora just said that this boy was just like him.</i></p><p><i>Kasumi sets her jaw and steps closer to the bed. She has a terrible urge to strangle the boy.</i></p><p><i>The small woman, Ono's mother, turns to Kasumi, tears in her eyes. Kasumi takes a startled breath. She doesn't like it when adults cry. They've been doing it a lot recently. It's like they are telling her there is no magical time when understanding comes and things stop hurting. There is no immunity to life.</i></p><p><i>"Who are you?" the woman seems confused.</i></p><p><i>Kasumi tells the woman her name, but doesn't say anything else, caught by the drama of the scene she finds herself in.</i></p><p><i>" Your mother is probably looking for you, child. These are not the times for children to be by themselves."</i></p><p><i>Kasumi is silent as she and the woman stand, staring at each other. Kasumi sees her own pain reflected in the woman's expression and she feels herself pulled toward her until her arms are wrapped around the small woman in an embrace. Kasumi doesn't know why she does this, but when she remembers this years later she reasons that much like the physical force, emotional gravity can sometimes bring people together as well as bring them down.</i></p><p><i>Ono's mother holds the embrace for longer than usual. She is alone now. Her husband dead, her only son in a coma, his condition worsening. Kasumi learns all this later when Ono's mother tells her story.</i></p><p><i>The teenaged Tofu is not inherently evil, Kasumi learns from the mother's story. He was seduced, tricked, manipulated. He is as much a victim as any that died by his hand. Maybe there is evil inside him, but there is also an innocent boy.</i></p><p><i>"How can I help?" Kasumi asks.</i></p><p><i>"You've already helped, child. Really your family must be worried about you, you should go."</i></p><p><i>But Kasumi isn't talking to Tofu's mother.</i></p><p><i>"He will die soon," Aurora says, "He has almost no ki left. There is a way you can help, but it means you must make another decision."</i></p><p><i>Kasumi nods.</i></p><p><i>"If you help this young man, then you and he will both die eleven years from now."</i></p><p><i>"If I don't?" Kasumi asks.</i></p><p><i>"Who are you talking to?" Tofu's mother tries to find what Kasumi is looking at.</i></p><p><i>Aurora replies. "Tofuro Ono will die in a few minutes if you do nothing. Beyond that I cannot tell you until you make your decision."</i></p><p><i>Eleven years seems a long way off to a nine-year-old. "I'll do It," Kasumi says.</i></p><p><i>Aurora stretches then into a long, thin filament connecting Kasumi to Tofu. Kasumi feels pain throughout her body. The sensation is first like a bruise on her entire frame, then it intensifies, becoming a burning and a cutting and strangely a chilling filling all at once. She would scream, but every muscle is taught. All she can let out is a strangled gargling from her strained larynx. Gradually the pain seems to come from two different places. She crumples to the floor and yet she also doesn't seem to move at all. As the pain begins to subside, she opens here eyes, and finds that she is some how looking at both the floor and the ceiling at the same time.</i></p><p><i>"Tofuro doesn't really exist anymore. His demon completely devoured him leaving only his body, a husk with only memories. What I have just allowed you to do is split your soul in two. One half of you will live your life as Tofuro Ono, the other as Kasumi Tendo." Aurora's breathy voice reverberates through Kasumi. She doesn't really understand.</i></p><p><i>Another person who doesn't understand is Tofu's mother. What she has seen is a girl arch her back and let out a terrible strangling noise while a curving beam shoots from the girl into her son. This is not tolerable to her.</i></p><p><i>"You little bitch!" Tofu's mother screams. "Get away from my son!" She picks Kasumi up and hurls her through the door and out of the room. Kasumi's hip slams into the opposite wall of the hospital hallway. A crack appears in the plaster. "Haven't you demons had enough with him? Stay away from me!" The woman slams the door so forcibly the wired glass in the small square window bursts into tiny shards.</i></p><p><i>Kasumi now only feels herself, but she feels some part of herself is missing. She begins to panic. She tries to get up. A terrible pain suggests that something is broken.</i></p><p><i>"Eleven years from now," Aurora continues, as if nothing has happened, "You will rejoin with Tofuro. When that happens, you will cease to be either Kasumi, or Tofuro, and become a full person once more. For now, you must be there for your family. The part of you that lives as Tofuro will become a doctor and learn what can be learned from books. You will learn patience, perseverance, and unconditional love."</i></p><p><i>Kasumi screams in pain, because now she can. In her short life, she has never felt anything so terrible. Before she felt pain but it was like it was something apart from her. This is raw, physical. And there's this terrible feeling of something missing. She knows where it is, it's just behind that door, but when she tries to get up to get through the door, she feels the pain from her hip again.</i></p><p><i>Aurora coalesces before Kasumi's eyes. "Tofu's mother is right. I am a demon. In the next awakening, I will destroy you."</i></p><p>"Kasumi-chan! What are you doing?" Tofu called out.</p><p>Kasumi got up, pushing off of the ground with hands that were now covered in scintillating lights. Her entire body was like that. Kasumi gasped. She swallowed, closed her eyes, and placed her hand gently on one of the red hot metal spider legs that Ranko was using. She relaxed, and allowed herself to be immolated.</p><p>~~~~~awkward zombie silence~~~~~</p><p>"Should I try to help Kodachi now?" Hoko nodded toward the dead gymnast.</p><p>Hiro blinked a few times. All he could see at first was blue and black. Residues of life. Pieces of death. Slowly, reality as he was used to seeing it came back into focus. "You can try, but I don't think it will work. I don't see her ghost anywhere. It's like when I was working homicide. I could always tell the suicides, because I felt nothing from them. They wanted nothing more from life and so they left no residue behind."</p><p>"Kodachi wanted to die?" Nabiki asked, apparently surprised.</p><p>Hiro scowled at Nabiki. Before realizing what he was doing, he used his power to knock her flatter to the ground. "Maybe Kodachi didn't know it herself, she obviously died violently." He turned his gaze to the subtly shimmering wall of the Kuno's ersatz palace. "Mr. Saotome said that the Kunos were masters of denial, but I guess in order to be in denial some part of you has to know the truth. I suppose in a way, death is the most ardent denial of life."</p><p>Hoko tilted her head in thought. "You know, that makes so much sense… it doesn't make any sense at all." She turned toward Kodachi. "I'm going to try anyway."</p><p>Hiro nodded and turned his attention back to Nabiki. She glared at him from the ground. He knew it was within his power to kill her again, to remove her from her body either directly or by causing it to rot. Part of him wanted to too, but it wasn't for a good reason. Nabiki hadn't killed his father. She hadn't even really done anything to her own father. She may have killed Kodachi, but that was probably in self defense, as much as part of him would like to think she was more evil so he could get rid of her. If Soun had wanted to live he could have, Nabiki had just given him permission to die. Who was to say that wasn't the right thing to do? He hated her for it, all the same.</p><p>There was a flash of light as Hoko's treatment did its work on Kodachi's body. Maybe people had to die, maybe some people ought to die, but not anyone Hiro cared about. Not on his watch. If Hiro could, he would have brought his father back from the dead that very moment. Only he couldn't. It was too long ago, and there was no body for him to go back to even supposing Hiro could find his soul among the throng of other dead.</p><p>Whatever the case, there was no reason to kill the Tendo girl for making a different decision. Hiro sighed. "Um…as long as you don't try to kill me or Hoko or anything, I, uh release you."</p><p>"Thanks a lot. You're a mensch really." Nabiki tried to stand, but was having the same trouble Hiro had before. "Look," she sighed, "Maybe I was a little heavy handed earlier, maybe I got a little bit of power and it corrupted me a tad. But I'm not screwing around here. I really need to get to Ranko. Maybe you don't care about her, but she could potentially kill a lot of people if she goes the wrong kind of insane. I…might not be that much better, but you've got me covered, and I'm the only one who might be able to stop her. So could we please, please stop resurrecting dead people for a minute and maybe save a few people from dying in the first place?"</p><p>Nabiki had a point. "Hoko?"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"You did your part. I'll watch over Kodachi and wait for the ambulance if you want to take Tendo to see her fiancée."</p><p>Hoko eyed her friend warily. "I'm not so sure I do."</p><p>Nabiki put up her hands. "I'll behave. I can barely move right now anyway. I'm sorry I'm not acting like much of a friend. I'm really glad you're alive, it's just there's a lot at stake here."</p><p>Hoko seemed to let go of some burden as she smiled and lent Nabiki a shoulder for her to lean on. "Okay, but no sneaky turning evil while I'm not looking, got it?"</p><p>Hiro nodded. "I'm trusting you again, Tendo. If you harm Hoko in any way I will not hesitate to kill you."</p><p>Nabiki's eyes flashed green as she said, "You have my word." She smiled sadly. "And it's not 'Tendo' any more."</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Hoko asked.</p><p>" My father's will dictates that should he die, custody of his children should go to Genma and Nodoka Saotome." Nabiki let out a sigh, and for a moment Hiro could see some of the anguish lurking below Nabiki's hard exterior. "The schools are joined, just as he would have wanted."</p><p>Hiro didn't like how convenient it seemed though. "How do you know his will says that?"</p><p>"Because I drew it up." Nabiki gave Hiro a sidelong glance. "You really don't know me that well, do you, Kawagami-chan?"</p><p>Hiro just set his jaw as Hoko and Nabiki Saotome walked away. He didn't know Nabiki that well, it was true. He had control of her now if he wanted it, but somehow he felt like he had a tiger by its tail. Nabiki seemed suddenly in her element, almost as if by not being in control, she was somehow more in control.</p><p>The whole mess gave Hiro a headache. He watched Hoko and Nabiki leave the Kuno atrium, and he felt an incredible wave of exhaustion hit him. He sat down beside Kodachi's body and Soun's, barely stifling a yawn. He wondered if anything else screwed up would happen before he could get to sleep tonight.</p><p>As he watched Kodachi's body , like a mechanical toy winding down, slowly stopping its breathing, he wondered if he would ever be able to sleep again.</p><p>Then the ghosts started showing up. Just shadows through his sunglasses. Screaming for vengeance, for pity, for one last chance. Hiro lifted the shades from his eyes with a hesitant hand. They all swarmed around Kodachi's body knocking each other back, the weak and meek ones quickly thwarted by the stronger, more insistent ones. It was a never ending kaleidoscope of carnage, that Hiro could only watch dumbfounded, until slowly, the ghosts began to realize that they couldn't possess the body by themselves.</p><p>A ten year old girl came up to Hiro, holding her own head in her hands. ~<i>They killed my parents. They killed my little brother. They killed me. They must pay.</i>~</p><p>"Well that answers that question. No sleep for me." Hiro mumbled to himself. The little girl would haunt his dreams forever. Unless…</p><p>Hiro touched Kodachi's body.</p><p>~<i>They killed my parents. My little brother!</i>~ , the girl insisted.</p><p>Hiro touched the girl's ghostly hand.</p><p>~~~~~echo chamber~~~~~</p><p>"Who are you?" the voice asked.</p><p>He she didn't know. The question annoyed him her on a fundamental level. So many people wanted to know that, didn't they? Well they could just fuck off!</p><p>"Who do you want to be?"</p><p>"I hate you."He she said, "I really hate you." He she squeezed Kasumi's neck with the white hot chain. But the voice isn't Kasumi's voice. It's something else. "Honestly! You have no right to ask these questions. You're just a peasant. I'm the best there is."</p><p>"No, Ranma. No, Kodachi. No, Akane. You're not."</p><p>"Oh yeah?" She he growls, forms a Tobu Sennuki and knocks Cologne through the wall surrounding the Tendo property.</p><p>"You were never the best." The voice spoke calmly. He she could smell the solidity of concrete after the first drops of rain. A tinge of ozone. "Happosai, Cologne, Tofu, even your father …they were all better than you. And there are others, many others, who you have yet to meet. On some level, you know this. You have to, otherwise you would never have tried so hard to improve yourself. Furthermore, egardless of what your level may have been, you are certainly not the best now. It would be difficult for you even to determine <i>what</i> you were the best in, would it not?"</p><p>"I'll get past this!" He she yelled against the doubts. He she was standing over Kasumi now. Kasumi was limp, her clothing burning, the scent of her cooking flesh reaching his her nostrils sporadically against the cool wet concrete smell.</p><p>"Let go of her!" Tofu cried, but he she ignored him. The real threat was Cologne, who was only just getting up. And this conversation with a voice coming out of Kasumi that wasn't Kasumi was something of a distraction.</p><p>"You will get past this, that is true. How you get past it though, is up in the air. Time is running out. You must make a decision. Are you a human being, plagued with demons, or a conglomeration of demons, loosely tied together by a corporeal form?"</p><p>"I don't even know what you're saying!" Tofu was picking up a bucket and pouring something out of it. He seemed to be moving faster than he should. Like a movie going in fast forward. And he she felt confusion, he she didn't know who to attack, or why. Just that there was something trapping him her. Something she he needed to defeat.</p><p>"You're on a great precipice now. The ways you can fall are infinite, but only a small fraction of these scenarios involve any semblance of who you are remaining."</p><p>"Yeah? And what can I do about it? I can't even keep myself from hurting people. Can't even control my body."</p><p>A shimmering light washed over his her vision. It wasn't warm, but cool. Like watching the surface of a pool from under the water. "You have to make a decision. You can't be all of these things you try to be. You have to choose. One species, one sex, one personality, one lover, one school of martial arts. You cannot be an individual if you are so many people."</p><p>He she released Kasumi. "Stop screwing with me!" She he decides to try to finish Cologne off, but he she hits a barrier. It glows an actinic blue where she he touches it. It burns, not like heat, or acid, but like…</p><p>~~~~~salt~~~~~</p><p>Tofu completed the circle of salt just in time. If Kasumi hadn't kept Ranma still, it would have been impossible. He had only a fraction of a second to drop his prepared seal on the circle before Ranma started to move again.</p><p>Kasumi was still in the circle. She was burning.</p><p>But Tofu could not go inside to stifle the flames. He couldn't disrupt the barrier now. He had to act quickly.</p><p>He ran to the koi pond. He held his hand over the water. A blue imprint of his hand appeared like a shadow on the surface. Concentrating, Tofu shifted the water through multidimensional space. An arc of water rose out of the pond. Every second he kept this arc of water aloft it would drain his energy. It took all his concentration, but he moved the water above around the ring of salt. Tofu took a breath through clenched teeth. Ripples appeared on the surface of the ring of water. The ripples grew smaller as the water vibrated at higher and higher frequencies. Dust fell from the water, all the impurities, physical and spiritual shaken out of the liquid. Tofu took three quick gasping breaths. This last bit had to be quick, it had to precise. He had to direct all of the water toward Ranma at once. Ranma, who was slamming herself against the barrier, screaming.</p><p>The water fell ten centimeters before Tofu regained his concentration. He had to aim it at Ranma, but once it fell it would splash everywhere, including the salt barrier. So if it didn't work, Ranma would be loose. But Kasumi was still burning.</p><p>Kasumi…</p><p>Tofu nearly lost it. His literal soul mate, the love he had tried to deny for so long, part of himself yet something so wonderfully gloriously different... she was dying! Tofu caught the water before it could slip out of his control. It was nearly eye level to Ranma now. Grimacing, he made his move. The water fell toward Ranma and splashed all over her deformed body. A hissing cloud of steam rose were the water touched her, but the barrier was down, and on Ranma's next lunge, she broke through.</p><p>She seemed to be dissolving, melting, even so she found Tofu, grabbed him by his shirt with a metallic talon of a hand, and lifted him into the air.</p><p>Tofu had no attack prepared, certainly nothing that would prevent his death if Ranma wished it. Thankfully, Ranma collapsed, releasing Tofu before anything else could happen.</p><p>~~~~~too late~~~~~</p><p>"Ranko!" Nabiki cried. She had just seen something with Ranko's face collapse in her backyard</p><p>"Go to her." Hoko advised. "I'll find a place to park and come back."</p><p>Nabiki dismounted and ran to Ranko, her body protesting each movement. Her vision darkened and she grew dizzy and nauseated, but she kept staggering to Ranko's body until she reached her. Tofu was just getting up when Nabiki got there. "Is she alright?"</p><p>"I don't know." Tofu said impatiently he ran over to a smoldering body a few meters away.</p><p>"Who is that?" Nabiki swallowed.</p><p>"Kasumi?" Tofu brushed the singed hair off his beloved's face, and then collapsed. Nabiki thought she might have seen a spark but it was too difficult to see in the dark of night.</p><p>Kasumi was hurt too? Nabiki almost went to see her sister, but she stayed by her fiancée instead. Ranko didn't look too good. In fact it was difficult for Nabiki to fathom how bad Ranko was. One of her hands was missing. The other arm seemed to end in a rusted tangle of metal. The same metal protruded out of Ranko's back like some sinister fungus and spread out in long jagged arcs like the legs of a dead spider. Ranko's legs…were very broken. Multiple compound fractures. They were barely recognizable as legs.</p><p>Nabiki's anger spiked, but she staunched it. She saw a flash of green around her. She was not going to let things get out of control again. She had to help Ranko. If she wasn't dead .</p><p><i>First things first,</i> Nabiki took a breath, <i>Make sure your fiancée isn't dead.</i> A few thousand questions fluttered in the back of her mind. Questions like "Is she still my fiancée?" ,"Why do I still think of her as a girl? " Why am I still in love with her?", and " Does this make me officially a lesbian now? " But the answers to all these questions were rather moot without knowing whether Ranko was okay or not.</p><p>Nabiki felt for a pulse. Very weak. Definitely not okay. Nabiki's mind raced. She never studied medicine. A genius she might be, but there are only so many things a person can read in a lifetime, and she cared more about money and negotiations than healing people. "Fuck. Now's not the time for a guilt trip," she admonished herself.</p><p>Problem was, there were two people she knew who could definitely help in this situation and neither of them were available. Happosai wasn't anywhere around, and Ranma, by virtue of being the person who was incapacitated, wouldn't be any help either, which was a pity because a magical super healing apple would be really convenient right now. Tofu could probably help too, except he was now passed was also Hoko, but she could only help if someone was dead. And they would need Hiro too if that happened. "Fuck." Nabiki repeated. Nodoka was watching from the engawa, looking worried and useless, except that the sword she always carried was blazing blue and white. Nabiki was glad she was there all the same. It's always good to have someone who can lie to you and tell you everything is okay. Finally, Nabiki spied Cologne hobbling toward the area, holding a duck that was probably Mousse in one arm and looking very beaten up. She fit more under the "crazy medicine woman" banner more than "qualified healer," but this was a big ass storm and Cologne was a port</p><p>Nabiki waited for Cologne to reach her before asking, "What can I do?"</p><p>"Stay here until he wakes up, if he does. He'll need to see you then.""</p><p>"But all the wounds, the broken bones..."</p><p>Cologne narrowed her eyes. "The wounds to Ranma's body are the least of his problems. And as far as I'm concerned he deserved every blow. I'm here to make sure he's down, not heal the poor fool."</p><p>Nabiki felt a twinge of anger, but was on top of it before it could manifest. "But she'll pull through this, right? "</p><p>Cologne thinned her lips. "That boy Tofu performed a purification ritual. An exorcism. If it worked, it means that every demon residing in Ranma's body was eradicated."</p><p>"That's good, but I'm guessing there's a problem?"</p><p>Cologne nodded. "If the purification ritual wasn't dangerous, we would have used it long ago. Ranma could have cured his curse with a purification ritual right after he came out of Jusenkyo. The problem is that the soul is in many ways a demon that you're born with. It's a little more complicated. Souls usually are very integrated with the body, are linked extensively to the various chakra and so on, but differences are in this case academic. Your demon, that green aura of yours. That's part of who you are; it's part of your soul. Using a purification ritual is like using bleach to wash out a stain. If you aren't careful, you'll ruin the natural dye of the fabric. Furthermore, when I was fighting Ranma his entire being was in flux. He was really just a conglomeration of different demons. All stain and no shirt. There's a good chance that all that's left now is an empty shell."</p><p>Nabiki shook her head. "She will survive. We Saotomes pride ourselves on adaptability." Cologne cocked an eyebrow. "Ranma shared his soul with me. I forget sometimes that I'm not him," Nabiki explained. There was no reason to reveal what was in her father's will to the Amazon matriarch just yet, she decided.</p><p>Cologne kept her eyes on Nabiki for a moment before turning her gaze toward Ranko again. "There is something more dire about this outcome though, I'm afraid."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"If Ranma is the originator of the Migration, he should be unstoppable. Purified water shouldn't even be able to touch him from all the demons around him. Instead it did all this damage."</p><p>"So…Ranko's not patient zero anymore? Is it me now? Is that it?" Nabiki felt herself flash with anger. She calmed herself, but she had about had it with being fate's bitch.</p><p>"No. It couldn't be you either. You're too stable, even now with your demon newly awakened. I don't think Ranma was ever the originator. Our patient zero as you call it, our antichrist, would have to be someone more powerful, more unstable, more moody. Someone who would have started the migration before Ranma. Someone Ranma knows. Someone who could have activated Ranma's shift away from equilibrium."</p><p>Nabiki thought about it for a moment, and then with a sinking feeling that didn't play well with her nausea, she knew."I think I have an idea of who it is," she breathed.</p><p>Cologne nodded grimly."Do you know where he is?"</p><p>Nabiki scowled. "No."</p><p>"We'll find out soon enough," Cologne sighed. "We'll just have to watch the news."</p><p>~~~~~frisky in frisco~~~~</p><p>[8:00 AM San Francisco, U.S.A]</p><p>Happosai stayed as far away from the curiously large sections of sexually inverted ki as he could. It was possible, even likely that he might find someone in those areas with Ranma's and Akane's delicious mix of masculine and feminine, but while inverted male ki was similar to feminine ki in some respects, as far as Happosai was concerned it was poison. Homosexual masculine ki was to feminine ki what methyl alcohol was to ethyl alcohol. They smelled similar, but one was pleasant as part of a beverage and the other could kill you.</p><p>Making it even more confusing were the people who actually were female but were cursed with a male anatomy. It was like an ice cream cone dropped in the sewer. Happosai would willingly spray everyone of them with Nyannichuan if it would help. But it wouldn't help most of them. Only the martial artists and devout priests, those with a lot of spiritual energy. Because curses were a breed of demon and demons didn't mess with normal people. Too much trouble, not enough benefit.</p><p><i>Ranma should be almost completely taken over by now, </i>Happosai mused. There was no way that Ranma was ready. No way that he could reconcile himself with his Jusenkyo curse, his nekoken, the soul of ice, AND all the shades of his enemies , friends and family. And who knew what other demons had found him in the meantime?</p><p>No. Ranma was lost to him. Nerima was probably already a pile of dust by now. Another "earthquake" hitting Japan. Happosai wanted no part in that. Not after the last time.</p><p>Happosai jumped on top of the almost step like buildings on one of the steep hills of the city, enjoying the ascension, the feeling of going somewhere, of leaving his dark thoughts behind.</p><p>A twenty something girl wearing sweats was taking her dog on a morning jog. Happosai laid his sack on the roof and leapt at her chest, causing her dog to bark and her to squeal in surprise. She was wearing a sports bra, but Happosai enjoyed a challenge.</p><p>As she tried to grab hold of him to pry him of her, he deftly maneuvered different parts of the garment in and out of existence so that he could get it off of her without losing any of her essence. After only a few seconds, he was victorious and he jumped back to his sack, put his new treasure in with the others and bounded away as the dog barked after him and the girl tried to figure out what happened to her. The girl's ki was a slightly sweet citrus, like a tangerine. She had recently gone through or was going through some kind of break up but she hadn't soured completely, and she was heterosexual without being submissive. A perfect find.</p><p>Happosai was lucky in that women tended to be a bit more loose regarding their orientation. It was a more of a continuum for them than a tight either or. So he had a wider range than he would have if he had been into men. Happosai didn't like the overly feminine girls any more than the total lesbians, they were too sweet. Kasumi was almost that bad, but she had a hidden aspect to her that made her otherwise unbearable sweetness almost alluring. Before Soun and Genma had trapped him in that cave, Happosai had even developed a taste for bisexuals. It was like a good strong coffee for him, bitter, yet undeniably pleasant. It was what made Akane almost as delectable a target as Ranma. Akane and Ranma were like tea and crumpets. The perfect combination. But of course that was only if both of them were girls.</p><p>If only the Yin Yang Thank You Ma'am incense had worked the way it was supposed to. Having female Ranma for the ki, and male Ranma as a student of the Art would have been perfect. But instead Ranma started another Ijuu, and now things were screwed beyond hope. Typical really.</p><p>Happosai tried to shake his head free of his moodiness. He was here to forget all that, damnit!</p><p>A few more roof hops and Happosai found a house large enough for his collection and charged with enough feminine energy to sustain him for as long as he wished to stay. A teenaged girl was staying there with her parents. A real powder keg from the taste of her ki. She had higher than normal levels of ki. Not near Ranma or even Akane's level, but maybe closer to Nabiki. And she had a lot of emotional energy, way higher than even Ranma's. Either she was just naturally imbalanced or something was keeping her from letting out her energy in a healthy manner. Either way, this usually meant she was horny. "This ought to be fun," Happosai snickered to himself. Then he jumped into the girl's window.</p><p>~~~~~End of Chapter 13~~~~~</p><p>Author's Note:</p><p>If there is one U.S. City that can compare with Tokyo, Japan for the amount of weird shit that goes on there in fiction, that would be San Francisco. If you read Tim Pratt, Scott Sigler, and/or Christopher Moore you know what I'm talking about. The Buffyverse has L.A. as its nexus of weird, but as far as I know L.A. doesn't have ships buried underneath it or a history of serial killers. I haven't been to San Fran or L.A. so I'm liable to err a bit on details, but then I've never been to Tokyo either. I'm told Godzilla doesn't actually exist. I'll believe that when I don't see it!</p><p>This chapter has not been preread or anything. If you see an error and feel like being helpful, let me know and I'll change it.</p><p>A few things:</p><p>The anime makes reference to a kawarimi no jutsu. It's apparently a common anime/manga trope and not just something in Naruto. Ranma in an episode sees someone appear change places with an object and wonders if it was a kawarimi. From Japanese Classes I also know that kawarimi is used a lot on the phone for when you're given the phone to someone else. I'm mentioning this because someone my take issue with Kuno knowing about it. For Kuno though, Ninja are normal, Panda curses are not.</p><p>Some may wonder why in the second chapter Happosai kept mentioning he was bound by honor to say things about the ijuu. There is a good reason, but I'm honor bound not to tell you:-)</p><p>Apologies to any who liked the killed off characters. Kasumi and Kodachi are only slightly killed off, so don't worry too much about them. Unless you have a problem with characters acting against canon, in which case I don't know how you've made it this far.</p><p>Ranma is not dead. All of Aurora's predictions will come true. This should give you some vague idea about how the rest of the fic will go in case I can't come back to it for some reason.</p><p>I haven't gotten through my big reveal yet, so I'm not ready to quit, but I see storm clouds on the horizon and I'm not sure if this old boat of a fic will make it.</p><p>Thanks for all your reviews and comments.</p><p>It shall continue to be weird.</p><p>.</p>
