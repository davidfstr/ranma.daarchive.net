</div><p><b>Thyself Known</b></p><p>A Ranma 1/2 fanfic by Zorknot</p><p><b>Ch.10: Possessions</b></p><p>DISCLAIMER: The thunder crashed, and the wind howled outside the hospital window. The machines blipped and whirred, keeping the young woman in the bed alive. Her husband sat beside her, holding her hand. The doctor came in with his stainless steel clipboard, a serious expression on his wizened face. The husband stood up, a hopeful look in his eyes. But the doctor shook his head. "I'm sorry," he said, "but the Ranma1/2 characters in this fanfiction are not the property of the author. They belong to Rumiko Takahashi. There's nothing we can do."</p><p><b>Helpful Readers:</b><br/>These are people whose comments I've used to make the chapter better.</p><p>Nicholas Leifker<br/>Tai Khan</p><p><b>Editor</b>(gave an in depth critique of the chapter)</p><p>Abdiel</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>THE STORY SO FAR:</b> …is hopelessly complicated. There is an underground conspiracy in Nerima bent on preventing the Awakening, which has something to do with the return of demons to the world. Ranma and most of the people he is attached to spiritually are part of something called the <i>Migration</i>, a sort of soul sickness that affects people with high levels of ki, causing them to shift to different aspects of their personality and consequently gain new powers as their chakras realign. The Migration is a prophesied event that heralds the Awakening, which the conspiracy is trying to prevent.<p>In an attempt to halt or at least slow down the Migration, Tofu gave Ranma an artifact called Thyself Known, which allowed him to consciously control which aspect of his personality he would exhibit. Trouble is, Nabiki was already part of the Migration before then, and a power awakened in her that almost killed her. To save her, Ranma had to share some of his soul with her, in the process, the Thyself Known became absorbed into both of them so that they both have to be together in order it to work.</p><p>Naturally, they fell in love.</p><p>Akane and the fiancee's aren't too happy about this. They too have become part of the Migration. Akane has Joined the Amazons, Shampoo has left the Amazons, and Ukyo's okonomiyakis are now filled with hate instead of love, making them explosive and deadly. Things are snowballing into a roiling frenzy.</p><p>Complicating this further, Copycat Ken, unable to return to his original form after fighting Ranma (anime canon), decided the reason he couldn't beat Ranma was that he wasn't vicious enough (NOT canon). He began systematically killing people close to Ranma so he could catch him by surprise. After killing four people, including Gosunkugi and Hoko, one of Nabiki's two henchwomen and the closest thing she had to a best friend, and absorbing the nekoken with his cursed camera that allows him to copy any technique, Copycat finally had his rematch with Ranma. Ranma, who had bonded more completely with his nekoken, killed him easily, after which Ranma discovered that both the camera and the blanket that Copycat used to change forms and learn techniques were part of a massive supernatural creature bearing a vague resemblance to a flying tapeworm that was likely messing with Copycat's mind.</p><p>Ranma sliced at the creature, cutting off the last three sections of its body, which held portions of Nabiki's and Hoko's soul along with some from Hiro, a traffic cop who had recently transferred to Nerima and who recently discovered he was a necromancer. For reason's which are unlikely to become clear again at the moment, he was trapped in Hoko's body when the bits of his and Hoko's soul returned. As a result Hoko is now alive again and Hiro has his own body back. But the experience seems to have affected his abilities…</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>ch.10: Possessions</b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Possession requires both control and intention. It is obtained from the first moment that both those conditions exist simultaneously. Usually, intention precedes control, as when you see a coin on the ground and reach down to pick it up. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that a person might obtain control of a thing before forming the intention to possess it."<p>-Wikipedia</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>fluorescent lights<hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Please! Pleas</i><i>e! You have to tell them my name! Tell them my name!</i><p><i>I want him dead! Kill him! Kill him!</i></p><p><i>Is it over yet? Please tell me it's over. I'm so lonely.</i></p><p><i>He's gonna get all the money! He's getting away scott free while I'm rotting here!</i></p><p><i>I don't understand</i><i>. I gave him everything in my purse. Why did he shoot me?</i></p><p>Hiro woke up with a gasp. All around him, shadowy figures were grabbing at him, begging him to help them. The room was full of the specters… each reaching for him… each screaming in pain or anguish. Without really thinking, Hiro reached into his breast pocket, pulled out his sunglasses and put them on. The spirits seemed to grow less substantial, their voices fading with their forms.</p><p>Hiro remembered his parents saying he used to scream all the time as a child. That he'd have terrible nightmares that would have him running from his room in fright. They stopped when he was about five years old. Hiro's first memory was of starting preschool at five a good six months after his nightmares had ended. Everything before that was a blank.</p><p>Aside from a few encounters with violent death working in the homicide division in his old precinct, Hiro had never seen ghosts before. Even in those cases he could blow it off as an over active imagination playing with his uncomfortably acute ability to empathize with victims. Except for the last one. The girl. He hadn't ever quite been able to rationalize that one away. Something had changed when he saw her. He had seen what she had seen, known what she had known. She had broken through his defenses, walls in his psyche he hadn't even realized were there, and she had left them weakened.</p><p>Ever since then, if Hiro listened, he could hear the whispering of spirits. But something had changed again. Now he couldn't help but hear them, even through the protection his sunglasses seemed to offer. It didn't help that he was now in a morgue.</p><p><i>My babies! They're all alone! My babies! Please!</i></p><p><i>It's so cold. Why is it so cold?</i></p><p><i>Kaori? Where are you Kaori? I can't see; there's too </i><i>much smoke. Call out your name, honey, so I can find you. Kaori!</i></p><p>"I've got to get out of here," He said, rising to his feet from the tile floor. He would wonder about why it was that his sunglasses were suddenly ghostblockers later, once he had some air.</p><p>"Hey, you're up!" Hoko's voice, a real voice coming from a pretty girl standing next to him, noted. "How's it feel to be in your own body again?"</p><p>"You're alive," Hiro remarked, confused.</p><p>"Yep! Apparently Ranma killed Copycat, and we got our bodies back! I'm trying not to think too much about how that's possible exactly."</p><p>Hiro nodded, "I remember this mist or something coming towards me and then it's a blank."</p><p>Hoko grimaced, "When it hit me, I got all the memories of what he did while using my body. It wasn't fun the first time. The second time…I'm just glad it was quick. I kind of wish we could resurrect the bastard just so I could kill him personally, but I'll work with what I've got."</p><p>A vivid memory of falling on his severed spinal chord gripped Hiro for a second before fading. "Okay…starting to come back to me now."</p><p><i>Is it over? Am I dead yet? I'm so lonely.</i></p><p><i>Someone please help me find her!</i></p><p><i>My babies! Please! Please! My babies!</i></p><p>Hiro shivered. Some of the spirits were hard to ignore. Part of him wanted to help them, but there were too many, and they were too grotesque, and it was all too much for him to handle after everything else that happened. "I really have to get out of here," He said again, and started walking hurriedly toward the door.</p><p>Hoko followed him. "Uncle Inamura said it'd be better not to move you in case you had a concussion. It's only been a few minutes. He's in his office at the department talking to Mrs. Saotome."</p><p>"Screw that! This place is freaky." Hiro burst through the door like a drowning man coming up for air.</p><p>Out of the morgue and in the relative warmth (and silence) of the hallway, Hiro asked, "Inamura is your uncle?"</p><p>"He's not my REAL uncle, no. Nabiki and I used to hang around his house a lot. We're friends with his daughter, Ami, though lately she's been acting like a bitch."</p><p>They reached the elevator and Hiro punched the up button. "Mrs. Saotome…that's Ranma's mother?"</p><p>Hoko smirked up at him. "You want the full soap opera version or the plain facts?"</p><p>The doors to the elevator opened and Hiro moved quickly inside. He wasn't sure if it was a real feeling or just nerves, but he had a sense of something chasing him. He greatly needed a distraction. He pressed the close door button several times and when they closed he let out a breath. "Soap opera version, I guess."</p><p>"Well," Hoko paused as she pressed the button for the ground floor, which Hiro had forgotten to do. Her long hair held a slight scent of lavender. "For about a year now, Mrs. Saotome, Ranma's mother, has been visiting at the Tendos…"</p><p>As Hoko continued telling him about Ranma's troubled relationship with his mother, her words slowly began to relax him. The elevator reached the ground floor and the doors opened. Hoko continued talking as they walked out. "The first I found out about this was the day girl Ranma came to school wearing a girl's uniform. That was about a month after Mrs. Saotome started visiting. About half the school still thinks female Ranma and male Ranma are two different people, but I and other students who pay attention to things know differently. A lot of people called him a pervert and a cross dresser and some things which weren't so nice, but he just took it. Nabiki's sister Akane tried to get them to stop, but Akane doesn't handle crowds too well. It wasn't until Nabiki started telling people the story and hinting that he would get back at anybody who made fun of him while he was Ranko that the teasing eased off. Since then about once a month Mrs. Saotome will stay at the Tendos for a few days and Ranma will come to school as a girl. "</p><p>They exited the hospital doors and walked across the parking lot to the police department. It was dark out, but the street lights were bright enough that Hiro could see even with his sunglasses. Hoko kept up her narrative. "The thing is, because Mrs. Saotome thinks 'Ranko' is a girl, she gets concerned when 'Ranko' acts like Ranma. You know, wearing boy's clothes, fighting people all the time, et cetera. She feels there's not enough of a parental influence, which is why she shows up every month or so, and why when she does, she makes sure Ranko goes to school dressed properly in a uniform. The last couple months she's stayed longer, like for a week."</p><p>"Must be rough for him," Hiro said. He had only been in a girl's body for a few hours and he was barely able to stand it. The idea of being like that for a week…</p><p>"Yeah the first couple times she was real depressed. She still gets moody from time to time but Ranma's adaptable. Lately when he's a she, she seems, I don't know, a little more relaxed. She's more approachable when she's a girl, I think. She has friends that male Ranma doesn't have. It's almost like she really is a different person. Funny thing is there have been more accidents at the school recently. Ranma was always a water magnet, but now even when he shows up as a guy about half the time he'll leave school as a girl. I was talking to Yuka Hakimune, she's friends with Akane and she'll hang out with female Ranma during lunch sometimes, her dad is a psychoanalyst and she thinks there might be a psychological element to the curse. That somehow Ranma is more apt to turn into a girl when he <i>wants </i>to be a girl, on, like, a subconscious level. I guess since the curse changed maybe he doesn't even need water. I still don't know how Nabiki turned male though. The past few days have been a real jumble, what with me getting killed and coming back to life and all. I think I need a few days to digest everything."</p><p>"I need at least a month," Hiro concurred. They reached the doors to the police department and went inside. They almost ran head on with Detective Inamura, Sergeant Suzuki, and a kimono-clad woman carrying a sword who Hiro assumed was Mrs. Saotome.</p><p>"Ah, Kawagami, good you're up. Do you mind taking Hoko home? I've got paperwork to fill out and Suzuki's taking Mrs. Saotome to see her…ah step-niece?"</p><p>"I suppose that's an accurate term for our relationship, even if it's not technically correct," Mrs. Saotome allowed. Addressing Hiro she explained, "I'm worried about Ranko. I know she's skilled at martial arts, I've heard she's almost as good as my son, but fighting a serial killer? Even if she did best him, it's just too dangerous for a girl her age."</p><p>Inamura shook his head. "She didn't just 'best' him, Mrs. Saotome, she killed him. If it weren't for the allowances we make for martial artists and for Sergeant Suzuki's surveillance tracking the killer from the department, she'd be in serious trouble. As it is, I want her to come in for a statement tomorrow."</p><p>Mrs. Saotome nodded. "I'll see that she does that."</p><p>"Now if you'll excuse me," Inamura gave a slight bow, "I've got to make all this seem normal and put a nice little bow on it before I report it to the main office." With that, he turned and left</p><p>"Well, I guess I'm taking you home then," Hiro said to Hoko. Turning to Mrs. Saotome, he bowed deeply. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Saotome-san."</p><p>Mrs. Saotome bowed politely, and having given his farewell, Hiro turned and left.</p><p>Hoko followed him until they were outside again. Then she stopped Hiro with a hand on his forearm. "Just what are these 'allowances' anyway?" she asked.</p><p>"Well, I'm still new here, but as I understand it any violent act committed between two martial artists is deemed strictly self defense. If Copycat had killed only martial artists, there wouldn't be much we could do without knowing more about how they were killed. Our job is to protect those who cannot protect themselves. Beyond that, we do not interfere."</p><p>"Makes your job kinda easy then doesn't it? I mean the martial artists here kind of police the area themselves."</p><p>Hiro shook his head. "That's what I thought. I transferred over here partially because of the low crime rate, but if the last day or so is any indication, when things go bad here, they go REAL bad."</p><p>Hoko nodded somberly. "I'm glad you guys are here. I…" Hoko looked up, taking a breath and closing her eyes. "Damn. It's so good to be alive!"</p><p>Without warning, Hoko opened her eyes and walked briskly toward the parking lot. "I'm driving," she declared over her shoulder at Hiro.</p><p>"I'm not sure if that's going to work," He said attempting match her pace. I'm bigger than you and…"</p><p>"I don't give a rat's ass if you're bigger than me, if you're older than me or you're a guy or a cop or a necromancer or whatever the hell else you want to be. I don't even care if you saved my life. I am driving my own fucking bike. If you don't like it, you can walk." She increased her speed as she said this to the point that she was almost at a light jog when she stopped suddenly, finding her bike in a pool of light from a parking lot streetlamp.</p><p>Hiro hadn't really noticed it before, having been preoccupied with being in the wrong body when he first rode on it. It was beautifully stylized with metallic red orange yellow and silver in a brilliant flame design. The exhaust pipes were all custom designed chrome with a nested flute pattern that, in the glare of light, looked like white hot plumes of fire. It seemed in direct contrast with what Hoko looked like, a rather conservative girl with straight black hair, but it spoke volumes of the fierce independence Hiro had seen in her in only a short span of time.</p><p>This was not a normal bike. This was something that was loved, cherished. Copycat knew that when he rode it. The memory of the psychopath's sadistic pleasure came unwanted now into Hiro's brain. Copycat took as his the product of years of work and sacrifice. He did so without any kind of respect or reverence as if it was his by default.</p><p>Hiro looked up and saw tears in Hoko's eyes as she touched the seat of the bike. He understood. Stuck in Hoko's body, he had felt completely violated, demeaned, helpless, but Hoko hadn't just had her body taken away. When Copycat had driven the motorcycle he wasn't just stealing a possession, he had stolen a part of Hoko's soul.</p><p>Hiro suddenly wanted to hit something. Something hard that would cause a lot of pain. He was actually looking for something he could hit when he heard Hoko release the kickstand.</p><p>He saw her mount the motorcycle quickly, as if finally coming to a decision and concluding the time for deliberations was over. She gripped the handles of the bike and paused a moment, a look of determination in her eyes. She was reclaiming it. It was hers again.</p><p>"You getting on, or are you going to watch my dust?" she called out brashly, her bravado only slightly marred by the crack in her voice.</p><p>Hiro got on and Hoko keyed the engine, kicking it to life and revving it with the handle. Hiro tentatively put his hand on either side of Hoko's slight frame. As he suspected it was awkward. Then Hoko took his arms and wrapped them around her torso. She leaned back into his chest, her silky lavender-scented hair touching his lower cheek.</p><p>Suddenly, it wasn't so awkward.</p><p>Hiro heard an odd sound behind him and craned his neck to see what it was. Two tapered cylinders painted in the same metallic fire pattern as the rest of the bike were moving out of a concealed compartment. They looked almost like miniature jet engines, but of course that was impossible.</p><p>"They're miniature jet engines," Hoko explained, yelling in order to be heard over the motor.</p><p>Once they were in position, on either side of the bike connected by a short, flat sheet of painted metal, the cylinders looked a little like wings. Inscribed on them were two Chinese characters. They were the characters Hou and Ko. Together they made up Hoko's name. The one on the left meant "Phoenix".</p><p>Hiro turned his head back and squeezed the phoenix girl to him as she flew out of the parking lot and into the street, completely ignoring every speed limit.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>reflection<hr noshade="" size="1"/>The city seemed different at night. Nodoka looked up at the passing streetlights through her warped and ghostly reflection on the car window. The fat, eye-patched form of police sergeant Masaki Suzuki was driving beside her with the dome lights on, mumbling something about not being able to find "it". The "it" was apparently the tracking device that he had put on the serial killer that her "step niece" bested in combat, though why he should be so keen on retrieving it was beyond her.<p>Nodoka tried to be proud of her son, but the feeling was as warped and ethereal as her reflection in the window. She had seen the news report. Ranma had chosen a bride most dramatically, and there was little doubt he was the manliest man in all of Japan... except she knew there was a problem. Genma had said that something had gone wrong. He had said something was agitating Ranma and Ranko, that maybe the only way to keep both of them from mental breakdown would be to adopt Ranko and banish Ranma.</p><p>Nodoka had seen her husband change first on accident, and then she had confirmed it later when she confronted him. He had told her about Jusenkyo, at least the part that involved him. He hadn't said anything about Ranma, but she knew about that too as much as she wished she didn't. Most of the time she had no problem forgetting the knowledge that lurked in the back of her mind. Ranko was Ranko, Ranma was Ranma. But at times like this, when her doubts were close to her, she wondered.</p><p>Was it worth it?</p><p>Yes, the contract required that Ranma be a man among men, but what if the pressure caused two children to be lost instead of merely one? This rash of manliness on Ranma's part... was it as good a sign as it seemed, or was a light burning brighter just before going dark forever?</p><p>The patrol car pulled over behind a couple walking on the sidewalk. The boy had an odd helmet-shaped hair cut and wore a black t-shirt with brown dogi pants- an odd fashion choice to say the least. The girl was fairly short and had fiery red hair in a pigtail. Ranko of course, no one else had that hair color, but she was wearing an orange shirt with the shoulders cut out and white shorts, which seemed more like something Nabiki would wear. Both of them walked barefooted and when they turned around, shielding their eyes against the glare from the headlights, it seemed as though there was a bullet hole in the boy's t-shirt. Nodoka had the familiar sense of something having happened that she was not likely to ever completely understand.</p><p>Sergeant Suzuki opened his door and grumbled out of his seat, his rotundity making it difficult for him to get past the steering wheel. Genma was anorexic compared to this character. Nodoka got out as well, wishing to greet Ranko and try to find out firsthand some version of what happened, even if it wasn't the truth.</p><p>Nodoka smiled when she saw Ranko's face. She loved the girl. She loved her spunk and the way she cared for others. She was real too, not some vague form that she could only catch in fleeting glimpses and, more recently, on news reports. Maybe if she adopted Ranko they could find some way to live together? But that wouldn't work either, of course, at least not indefinitely. But maybe it wouldn't be so bad with Ranko around, it would have to be better than being alone…</p><p>The family sword vibrated in its sheath. Nodoka gripped the handle tightly. <i>Patience, Hayama,</i> she thought, though it had the feeling of a prayer. <i>You will be released soon, but it must be done the proper way.</i></p><p>Nodoka felt a wash of guilt. She had been thinking of giving up on her son. Gods help her, but she had been thinking of it.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>headlights<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki and Ranko had walked in silence for about fifteen minutes before the patrol car pulled up behind them. Nabiki could have started up the motorcycle again, but it would have been too loud…too agitating. He and Ranko needed calm. Something had happened to them and they weren't sure what. Nabiki knew Ranko felt the same way. He and she were connected to such a degree they were practically the same person. They had differences, yes, but it was like they were one brain with four hemispheres instead of two. When they embraced they felt more complete, but at the same time it was like one's right hand clasping one's left.<p>This feeling they felt, Nabiki knew he felt it differently than Ranko, but he knew exactly how Ranko felt about it. Ranko was a little scared. She felt out of control and unsure of herself. It was the reason she wanted to be a girl at the moment, because men weren't supposed to feel that way. Nabiki would have chided her except he now knew the extent of the brainwashing Ranma had endured over the years. Men weren't supposed to feel, period. Even as Ranma, Ranko had been a bit more sensitive than most. But Ranma had severe stoicism beat into him at an early age. Ranko relished her feelings having escaped through a loophole in her conditioning, but she also feared them.</p><p>Nabiki, by contrast, was a stoic by choice. No one had forced him to mask his emotions, or play on the emotions of others, he came about it naturally. He had good reasons not to trust his emotions, and that was why he was male. For whatever reason, it was easier to block emotions in the male form. Maybe it was the residual male ego from Ranma's influence, though a great deal of that had been evened out. At any rate, it was a little like all his life, Nabiki had been playing with a handicap that he hadn't even been aware of, and now it wasn't there. On one hand it was easier to not feel what he was feeling. At the same time, it wasn't as satisfying. There wasn't as much skill involved.</p><p>What Nabiki felt was cold, yet resolute. He would get them through this, whatever it was. He would let Ranko worry, because she needed to worry. And she would let him pretend to ignore his own doubts, because he needed to do that. They both felt different things, but knew that they were really feeling the same thing, and their minds repeated the same message over and over in varying iterations:</p><p>They had crossed a line. They had killed and felt no remorse. They had passed a threshold. They had murdered. They had changed. They ended a life. They were no longer completely human.</p><p>And as they walked, this mercurial mantra winding through their heads like the ticker tape from some tireless outdated machine, they drew closer together and further apart from the world around them, until the headlights of the patrol car grew at their backs and they turned around, shielding their eyes against the brightness.</p><p>"Alright, you chuckleheads," growled a short, fat man in a uniform after clambering out of his vehicle. "Where the hell's my eye?"</p><p>Nabiki and Ranko blinked a bit. They recognized Sergeant Suzuki from the police station, but they looked at him differently now. He didn't have much of an aura. It was dark brown and seemed to appear almost accidentally around his body as if it were embarrassed to be there, and there was a thin red filament that came out of his eye patch and continued above the buildings and toward the east.</p><p>Nabiki absently pointed in the direction the filament seemed to go.</p><p>"Could you be a bit more specific? Not that I don't mind searching through every god-cursed alley this side of Nerima, mind you. I do that sort of thing for kicks, really. Every third fucking Tuesday."</p><p>Nabiki's eyes thinned. Beside him, Ranko piped up. "About how much money do you think that information's worth, Firefly?"</p><p>Nabiki smiled, "I'd say at least a couple thousand yen." Then he saw Nodoka exit the patrol car.</p><p>Even though Nodoka was wearing a kimono, and her hair was in her usual bun, she was still shockingly attractive when compared to Sergeant Suzuki. Nodoka was approaching middle age, but still looked in her twenties. She was practically a taller Ranko with darker hair. The resemblance was unmistakable, and yet Nodoka repeatedly mistook it.</p><p>There had been times when the lady seemed quite sharp though. As if hidden in her silken kimono was an iron determination, and her predilection toward tradition was really a well-played ruse.</p><p>She had a strong aura that stayed mostly in the blue, but shifted smoothly from light to dark and sometimes into green. She was hard to read. What was oddest though was the sword she carried. It actually had its own aura. A blue and white vortex that seemed to whip around it impatiently.</p><p>Nabiki noticed Nodoka tighten her grip on the handle of the sword and moved between her and Ranko. He felt his ki claws come out. Was Nodoka a threat?</p><p>Ranko's hand on his shoulder mollified him. <i>This </i><i>is my battle</i>, Ranko was saying,<i> let me handle it.</i></p><p>Coming from behind Nabiki, Ranko called out to Nodoka, "Auntie Saotome!" She rushed to woman in the kimono and the two figures embraced, at first almost like strangers, and then like vampires feeding off each other through their hearts, and then, for a moment, like mother and child. The moment passed like the shine of a silverfish and the two released each other, but it was enough for Nabiki to suspect that regardless of what played out on the surface, neither Saotome held any illusions as to who the other really was. But then why…?</p><p>"Saotome Nodoka?" Ranko interrupted Nabiki's analysis, "I want you to meet…er…Takahata Hotaru, my boyfriend."</p><p>Nabiki cringed at the name. Not so much Hotaru, he was used to being called "Firefly" by now and even though it had some unfortunate connections to Sailor Moon manga, it was still mostly gender neutral and probably the best choice. Takahata, though, immediately brought Grave of the Fireflies (Hotaru no Haka) to mind. Nabiki had hated that movie. That stupid kid letting his sister die because he wouldn't get a freaking job…Still, this was improv. It wouldn't do to negate the premise.</p><p>"Pleased to meet you." Nodoka bowed slightly.</p><p>"Take it easy on me," Nabiki smiled and bowed slightly deeper.</p><p>After the introduction, Nodoka seemed to go distant for awhile, thoughts apparently lost on some tangent.</p><p>"What the hell you trying to pull?" Sergeant Suzuki snapped, reminding everyone of his presence. "I was at the precinct. I know you two are really Ranma and Nabiki. You only have one alternate form and you haven't even bothered to change clothes. Why do you shape shifters always have to make out like you're masters of espionage or something?"</p><p>"I'm sorry," said Ranko with a saccharine smile, "You must have been confused. I like to pretend I'm Ranma sometimes. We're very close you see, and it's sort of a game we came up with. Hotaru here had such a strange haircut, and it reminded me of Nabiki's style, so I thought he could join in on the act. We really didn't mean to be so deceptive."</p><p>Ranma lying so easily…that didn't use to be the case. Part of it was from their bond, Nabiki knew, but he also knew that part of it was from practice. When you're sure your mother would literally kill you if she knew the truth, you learn to lie pretty quick.</p><p>"Listen, Red," Sergeant Suzuki pointed an angry finger at Ranko, "I may not look like much, but I'm an officer of the l-"</p><p>Nodoka put a hand on Sergeant Suzuki's shoulder, restraining him. "What she says is correct, officer. It's an odd habit and I've scolded her about it, but she still persists. She's getting a little old for these games, but I can't do much about it. I'm not even really her aunt, and besides, children grow up so fast these days. I say let them be innocent a little longer."</p><p>Nabiki felt a shiver run through his body. "Innocent" was no longer a word that described him and Ranko. Not in any sense. "We'll help you find your eye," Nabiki volunteered, hoping to distract himself from the thought, "just as soon as we take care of payment."</p><p>"I'm not going to pay you!" Suzuki said incredulously, "I only have two eyes, damn it, and thanks to you and your psychotic sidekick one of them is lost somewhere in the dark streets of Tokyo."</p><p>Nabiki blinked. Suzuki was seriously mistaken if he thought <i>Ranko</i> was <i>his</i> sidekick.</p><p>"I'll give you a side kick up your ass, Cyclops. I don't care if you are a cop," Ranko shot back. Her ki claws extended a centimeter from her fists.</p><p>Nabiki touched Ranko lightly on her arm. <i>Easy there, Sunshine. </i></p><p>Ranko calmed herself.</p><p>"Yeah, go ahead and threaten me, Ninja Girl. I don't know why Inamura puts up with you clowns, but when the head of the department gets back from America we'll see how…" Suzuki trailed off. "Wait. How the hell did it get over there? Shit. It's too close to the water." Suzuki moved quicker than Nabiki might have guessed possible for someone so large, scrambling into his patrol car. "Sorry!" he yelled out of his window in an insincere tone, "I got to get there before… aw hell someone's getting closer. Look, you'll have to walk home. Tell whatever idiots try to mug you I said 'Hi'!" With that, Suzuki engaged the engine, squealed his tires and left.</p><p>"What a rude person," Nodoka said.</p><p>Nabiki was inclined to agree.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>calling<hr noshade="" size="1"/>It had a different name, but that's what Yuka and her family had always called it, and so Sayuri and Akane took to calling it that too. Night Beach. The reason was that it only seemed like a beach at night, when it was colder and when most of the people were gone. Yuka's grandparents still worked at the ryokan where they were all staying tonight. All day they would have to deal with the demands of the crazy gaijin tourists who wanted hamburgers with their sake and demanded a "real" mattress instead of a futon even after their wives tried to explain to them that it's not that type of hotel and that if they wanted that they could have gone to the Marriot... The couple that stormed out a few hours earlier still had Sayuri miffed. Sometimes knowing English was a curse.<p>Yuka's grandparent's had to deal with that crap all day, and they didn't get a break until the night. Then the two of them would walk about half a kilometer out to the Night Beach and sit, watching the tide come in to wash away all the madness.</p><p>Sayuri thought Yuka's grandparents were too nice. Family was one thing, but letting her and Akane impinge on their alone time was taking hospitality too far.</p><p>But despite feeling a little guilty, she wouldn't say anything. The moon was shining on the waves as they crashed upon the shore and everything was crisp, cold, still, and beautiful. Tonight they were all sitting on the cool sand, her, Akane, Yuka, and Yuka's parents, uncle, and grandparents. They were silent as they sipped the tea from the thermoses they had brought. This was a precious gift, this moment, and Sayuri didn't have the heart to return it.</p><p>Sayuri's mom was the stereotypical office lady. Divorced and harried. Her mom tried, but the simple fact was that in order to be there for your kids, you have to be there, and Mom couldn't do that. Sayuri was used to feeling lonely, but it was times like this when she could see what she was really missing. Times like this, when she felt the bond that the Hakimune family had, that Sayuri loved them more than even her own mother.</p><p>Beside her, Akane sighed. "I needed this," she said, seeming to put Sayuri's feelings into words.</p><p>"We all did," Yuka agreed, surprising her. Sayuri gave her a questioning glance. Yuka never seemed to have any problems. In response, Yuka grimaced slightly and got up. "I'm going for a walk. You guys want to come?"</p><p>It was the kind of request you don't say no to, and at any rate, the mood was broken with the silence. Sayuri and Akane got up to follow her.</p><p>"We'll probably head back soon," Yuka's father said, "don't stay out too late okay?"</p><p>"Okay, Daddy, we won't," Yuka said and started walking to the edge of the surf. When they were out of earshot, Yuka said, "Guys, I need your opinion on something."</p><p>"What is it?" Akane asked, concerned.</p><p>"Yeah, usually we're the ones asking for advice." Sayuri nodded.</p><p>"I know, but this… I can't think about this clearly." Yuka looked back toward her family, and then she looked down, crossing her arms as if hugging herself. They were all dressed for the cool night temperatures, but every now and then a cool breeze would cut through and cause one of them to shiver. Yuka seemed to be suffering from a different chill though. "I'm thinking of maybe not going to a university when I graduate."</p><p>"But you're going to be a psychotherapist!" Akane protested, "How can you do that without a university degree?"</p><p>"I know, but… It's Grandma and Grandpa. They're getting old, and Grandpa…he's starting to forget things. We're not sure how long they can keep running the ryokan."</p><p>"Can't they hire more people or something?" Akane asked.</p><p>Yuka shook her head. "Grandma and Grandpa are very traditional. They hire people from time to time to help with repairs and the like, but otherwise they do everything themselves. The ryokan's been in the family for generations and they don't want it leaving the family. Daddy was supposed to take over after them but he went into psychology instead. So now…"</p><p>"Why can't you do both. Be a psychotherapist AND help with the ryokan?" Sayuri asked.</p><p>"Even if I had enough time to do that after classes and studying for exams and homework it wouldn't work out. Dad tried that. What Grandma and Grandpa do… it's like they're monks or something. It's a way of life. You can't just do it on the weekends."</p><p>"Maybe your mom or dad could retire and help out?" Akane suggested.</p><p>"Mom and Dad are both very dedicated to their jobs. Daddy almost has a complex about his work and Mom's a teacher who actually cares about what she does. Asking her to retire would be like… I don't know. It'd be like asking Grandma and Grandpa to give up the ryokan."</p><p>They walked in silence for a while by the water. The beach would always be here regardless of what happened to the ryokan. But without the Hakimunes, it wouldn't be Night Beach anymore. It'd only be one of the many beaches of Japan. If the Hakimunes didn't own the ryokan, it would be some business man or woman, hoping to make as much money as they could. They might even tear down the ryokan and build another Marriot or Hilton. The beach would still be a beach, but it would lose its soul.</p><p>Yuka's grandparents <i>were</i> like monks. Even during the day the ryokan seemed so peaceful. People staying there were treated to something almost sacred. It was why people like Mr. Hamburger upset Sayuri so much. Here was this wonderful experience they could have and instead they want the same crappy things they're used to. But there were also people who appreciated the gift, who came away having been subtly changed by the experience. Without the ryokan…nothing. It'd be nothing. Just a beach and another boring hotel room.</p><p>Sayuri suddenly had an idea. "Maybe…I could do it!"</p><p>"Huh?" Yuka asked.</p><p>"Listen, you and Akane know what you want to do right? Well I don't. I'm not a martial artist, I'm not good at reading people like you are, Yuka, and really I'm not much good at anything. Maybe I just need a calling though, maybe this is it." Sayuri started to get excited, "I mean I love it here. I could learn from your Grandparents and start helping during the day. It's not like I'm doing that well in school anyway, and so I could just work here full time. Then I could keep it going when your grandparents aren't able to."</p><p>"Um…Sayuri," Yuka held up her hand in a stop gesture, "You're forgetting the main problem here. You're not a Hakimune, no matter how often you hang around the house."</p><p>Sayuri deflated. It was a stupid idea, and she was stupid for saying it.</p><p>"Sayuri, that was supposed to be a joke," Yuka explained with a slight smile.</p><p>"I know. Sorry. I guess you're in a tight spot." Sayuri looked up at the moon as she kicked at the sand. It was none of her business what happened to the ryokan or to Yuka for that matter. It wasn't her family. It wasn't her problem.</p><p>"Honestly, I don't know what to tell you," Akane said. "But my sister Kasumi took care of the house after Mom died and Dad became a wreck. She was going to be a doctor, but she seems happy enough now, maybe it isn't so bad?"</p><p>Sayuri shook her head though neither Akane or Yuka saw her. Yuka wasn't like Kasumi. She had too much ambition. Her dreams were too powerful.</p><p>Sayuri saw something out of the corner of her eye. She turned her head for a better look. <i>Oh it's just a gigantic flying flat segmented thingy with a circular mouth and teeth.</i> She turned her head back to the sand beneath her. <i>Wait a minute…</i> Sayuri looked again and the giant… thing seemed to fly into the sand where they had been walking with a gentle thud.</p><p>"Whatever you choose to do, Yuka, we're behind you," Akane said. "Right, Sayuri?"</p><p>"Did either of you see that?" Sayuri asked.</p><p>"See what?" Yuka looked around.</p><p>"I don't know what it was, but it was big and looked like it went straight into the sand over there."</p><p>"Hold on," Akane said with a tinge of martial arts bravado, "I'll go check it out."</p><p>Sayuri waited with Yuka as Akane stalked up to something, and nudged it with her foot.</p><p>"It's okay I think!" She called out. "Somebody left their towel and a camera, that's all it is!"</p><p>Sayuri started toward it but Yuka stopped her. "Hold it," she whispered, "Remember this is the same girl who said that the bomb the principal left in our classroom a few weeks ago was 'just a pineapple'."</p><p>"Noted," Sayuri said, but she went ahead anyway. She felt Yuka was being a little unfair. It had looked an awful lot like a pineapple. The fuse was barely visible.</p><p>The camera and the green cloth, not really a towel in Sayuri's estimation but more of a thin blanket, seemed to be just that. The blanket was folded neatly into a square. The camera rested on top. The words around the lens read "Made in Japan." Now if it had said "Made in the USA," Sayuri might have been suspicious. But if it was made in Japan, it was reasonable to assume it wasn't going to blow up. Sayuri moved to pick it and the blanket up.</p><p>"Wait," Akane said, "I'm sorry. I think I may have called you over too soon."</p><p>"What's wrong?" Sayuri asked.</p><p>"I don't know. It's…it's too… normal looking."</p><p>"That's bad?"</p><p>Akane looked like she was having some sort of epiphany. She'd been getting the look a lot since she showed up at Yuka's earlier this evening. Sayuri had asked her about it, but she said she'd explain later. Akane swallowed. "I think, yes. I've been through a lot the past year and something happened yesterday…it's like I'm seeing everything I went through for the first time. Look, we didn't see this the first time we passed this point, right?"</p><p>Sayuri nodded. She glanced over at Yuka who was looking a mix of impatient, concerned, and uncomfortably curious. "But maybe we just didn't see the blanket and camera, because we were talking with Yuka."</p><p>"But you saw something 'big' hit this spot, right?"</p><p>"I don't know what I saw. It could have been anything."</p><p>"But…it's not anything. If something big landed here, there should BE something."</p><p>Sayuri frowned. "What, you mean like a crater, or a giant bug monster or something?"</p><p>Akane was silent for a while. She seemed to mull over the idea in her head for a moment before she said. "Yes. It's not so much that there's nothing here. There is something, but its completely normal looking. I mean before today, I might just think 'no problem' and pick it up but…Sayuri, honestly, something that falls out of the sky has no business being this normal."</p><p>"Akane, I just said, I don't know what I saw. Maybe nothing fell out of the sky. We have to be rational here. Someone just forgot their camera and their blanket. We have to bring them to the lost and found."</p><p>Akane just gave her a worried look.</p><p>Sayuri shook her head. "Look, if you won't take them, I will." She picked up the blanket with both arms, letting the camera rest on top. The blanket was a little rough, probably made of cheap wool, or maybe a polyester mix. Other than that there was no sensation. "See? Nothing happened. Nobody blew up. Now let's just get going, shall we?"</p><p>If anything, Akane looked even more concerned. "Sayuri, I'm sorry. I should have picked that up the moment I thought something was wrong. Maybe everything's okay. I hope so. But I've had to deal with curses and magic and demonic possessions, and I'm getting major déjà vu here. You've got to promise me that the MOMENT anything strange happens you'll tell me, okay?"</p><p>"Akane, it's just a blanket and a camera, I don't see-"</p><p>"Promise me!"</p><p>"Okay, okay, I promise, yeesh. What's gotten into you lately?"</p><p>"It's a long story. I'll tell you and Yuka all about it when we get back to her. Just remember, Yuka and I are your friends. We're here if you need us, okay?"</p><p>"Thanks, Akane, but I don't understand why you're so worried."</p><p>"You want to make me feel better?" Akane asked, suddenly shifting gears.</p><p>"Um… sure."</p><p>"Give me the blanket and camera."</p><p>"No!" Sayuri snapped, "Why should I? Because of some superstition you have about normal things?"</p><p>"Just drop them, then. You can pick them up right after. Just humor me."</p><p>Sayuri almost did just that. She thought about opening her arms and letting the blanket and camera fall. The idea made her nervous though…She laughed off the tension. "Come on, Akane that's just silly."</p><p>Akane sighed. "If you can't even do that…Sayuri go ahead and call me crazy. I've been called worse things. But you're acting like I did before today. I think this thing is already playing with your mind. And the way you picked it up, it was like you were drawn to it. Like it chose you."</p><p>"Akane, you're crazy. This is a camera and a blanket, not some demonic 'thing'."</p><p>"I already know you're not going to listen to me, Sayuri. Just remember I'm here if you need me, and Yuka's here for you too." Akane nodded toward the space behind Sayuri.</p><p>Yuka had come over while Sayuri wasn't looking, "Something wrong?" she asked.</p><p>"No," Sayuri responded, "nothing much. Apparently Akane thinks I've been cursed by an infernal camera and blanket demon duo. I think she needs to get some sleep or something."</p><p>To Sayuri's exasperation, Yuka did not laugh. Instead, she asked Akane: "We aren't in Nerima right now; you really think something like that could happen out here?"</p><p>Akane shrugged. "There are gigantic duck-billed platypuses living in Ryugenzawa. Nerima doesn't exactly have the weird market cornered."</p><p>Sayuri let out a small scream. "Am I the only rational person here?"</p><p>Yuka put a hand on Sayuri's shoulder. "Yes, Sa-chan. And I'm afraid that's a strong indicator that you've completely dissociated yourself from reality."</p><p>"Hey, guys," Akane said, "someone's coming this way."</p><p>Sayuri looked where Akane indicated and saw a very fat man in a police uniform bumbling toward them from the beach parking lot. The moonlight was enough to see him with, but he was using a flashlight to scan the ground in front of him, and Sayuri was temporarily blinded when he directed it at her.</p><p>"Oi!" The officer called out "Any of you girls see an eye?"</p><p>"An…eye?" Akane asked, her hand shielding her own eyes from the glare of the flashlight. "No…uh…sorry."</p><p>"You." The officer directed the beam to Sayuri. She had to squeeze her eyes shut against the light. "Is that your blanket?"</p><p>"No, officer, we found it just a little while ago with the camera."</p><p>The policeman lowered the light and walked closer to her, saying "I suppose you thought you'd put it in the lost and found, huh?"</p><p>"Yes, we were just going over there now."</p><p>The policeman was the same height as Sayuri, short for a man. The patch made him look like a pirate. A very round, Asian pirate in a uniform. He walked up to her, inspected her with the flashlight for a moment or two then, looking at the blanket he smiled. "Aha! I found you, you little bastard." He plucked something off the blanket.</p><p>It was an eye.</p><p>Sayuri stared wide-eyed as the man took off his patch and lifted his head to place the eye, with its dangling optic nerve, into his empty socket. He blinked a few times, looking for all the world like he had just put in a contact lens. Then he addressed Sayuri casually. "I don't suppose you'll let me take that blanket and camera? It's sort of evidence in a murder investigation."</p><p>"What do you mean, 'sort of'?" Yuka asked.</p><p>"We're done investigating. The murderer was killed. Open and shut case. I had my eye on him the whole time. It's just that he owned that blanket and camera that you're carrying, and after he died they both flew over here somehow. It's a bit curious."</p><p>A blanket and camera flying ANYWHERE was more than curious. Besides, murder? "Take it," Sayuri said quickly, holding the blanket and camera out to the officer. She no longer wanted anything to do with the two items. Strangely, though, she felt as if she was betraying them somehow.</p><p>The officer moved to accept them. She tried to keep her arms out, but she felt a wave of panic and brought the blanket close to her again. The more she tried to release her grip the more tightly she squeezed it until, like sand slipping through her fingers the blanket was gone.</p><p>"Psh." The officer rolled his eyes. "That's what I thought. Fucking demons. Ah well. It's yours now. Try not to kill anybody." With that he walked off, grumbling about something.</p><p>"Wait!" Sayuri yelled after a few moments spent coming to grips with the idea that the blanket and camera she had been holding were now apparently gone. The next moment, as the officer stopped, she realized something else. The blanket and camera <i>weren't</i> gone. She could <i>feel </i>them. She backpedaled mentally, changing the question she was going to ask from "What the hell just happened?" to "What do you mean demons?"</p><p>Hearing the question, the officer turned around. His eye glowed dark red. "I mean," he said, his voice taking on a growl and a tone that was at once both angry and condescending, "spiritual parasites that invade your body, feed off your soul and force you to do bad things. Ask your parents about it. Or your friend there," the officer nodded toward Akane, "she has a demon of her own. Me, I've had enough stupidity for one night. I'm off duty and late for my beer appointment. I hope I never see you again, but I probably will." He waved her off lazily as he turned back around and trudged through the loose sand to his car.</p><p>"What a rude person," Yuka noted.</p><p>"Akane?" Sayuri asked.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"You know how you said to tell you the moment anything strange happened to me?"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"I'm pretty sure this qualifies."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>faith<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi poured tea first into Tofu's cup and then her own. Sitting down, she blew some of the heat off the tea and sipped slowly, closing her eyes and letting the warmth fill her. There was a slight chill this evening, a pernicious shiver that she couldn't quite quell with warmer clothing. Turning the heater on would be overkill and would waste energy, especially with her and Tofu being the only ones inside. It was a little too early for the furo. This was the best solution.<p>"Thanks, Kasumi," Tofu said needlessly. Still, Kasumi smiled and nodded in appreciation. Tofu still acted a little silly around her from time to time, but it was a good silly, not a potentially fatal silly.</p><p>Kasumi let her thoughts drift. She had been so happy on their date two nights ago, now… It wasn't fair. That's what it came down to. Kasumi realized it was a rather petulant argument, but that was it. She had given up on being a doctor. That dream seemed so far away now. She had decided her family was more important and she did not regret the decision. But then, with Auntie Saotome coming so often and Tofu opening up to her, it made her think she could have more.</p><p>"Do you think we should talk about it?" Tofu asked.</p><p>Kasumi nodded.</p><p>Tofu and she each took a sip of tea before Tofu started. "We don't know exactly what it means. It could just mean that we'll get married. That would be nice wouldn't it?"</p><p>Kasumi shook her head. "The words came with the vision.' The two will become one' doesn't mean we'll be joined. We'll actually become one person. Either one of us will die, or we'll merge somehow. Either way, we'll be alone again."</p><p>"What happened eleven years ago? Why can't I remember all of it? What's this Awakening?"</p><p>"Who knows?" Kasumi riposted. "It seems like the kinds of stories the nuns would tell us at St. Hebereke's. Armageddon, Judgment day, the Apocalypse." Kasumi had gone through grammar school at St. Hebereke's back before it became a high school…and before her mother died.</p><p>Tofu gave a small laugh. "That would make Ranma the Antichrist."</p><p>Kasumi took a thoughtful sip of her tea and then sat the cup down on the table. "But the nuns would also tell us God's plan for us is often mysterious, and that He gave all of us free will. I think that includes any possible Antichrists. Regardless of the situation, we have to try to make the right decisions and help others do the same."</p><p>"We're home!" Ranma-chan called out from the side entrance.</p><p>"Speak of the devil," Tofu quipped.</p><p>Kasumi smiled as she got up to answer the door. "Come in!" she called out as she walked past the steps to the doorway.</p><p>Ranma-chan was accompanied by her mother and boy-Nabiki. Ranko was wearing a thin blue sweater and a black…no it wasn't a skirt, it was a pair of pants but it was loose enough in the leg and of soft enough material to make the difference academic. "That's a lovely outfit, Ranko." Kasumi noted.</p><p>"Yeah, we went shopping." Ranma lifted up her bag and Nabiki nodded lifting up his. Nabiki wore a dark green dress shirt over an orange t-shirt tucked into black jeans. He was lanky and attractive despite the haircut, which on a boy made one think of a foppish prince in a period film. Kasumi wondered how Nabiki withstood the experience of shopping as a boy. It had to have at least been different.</p><p>Nabiki nudged Ranma and she spoke again, "Oh yeah, uh, Nabiki said she was going to stay at Ami's house tonight. This is Hotaru, my er…boyfriend. Is it all right if sh…he stays over?"</p><p>Kasumi couldn't help raising an eyebrow. Even if it was part of a ruse, Ranma claiming someone as his boyfriend was a bit alarming. Kasumi recovered, smiling and playing the game she usually played when someone close to her wanted her to lie. She just pretended it was the truth. This wasn't Nabiki and Ranma, her sister and future brother-in-law; this was her cousin Ranko and her boyfriend. "That's fine, Ranko-chan, but I don't think it would be proper for you to stay in the same room. The house is a little empty right now anyway. You can sleep in Akane's room if you want, and Hotaru-kun can sleep in Nabiki's room, just as long as he doesn't disturb anything. I'm afraid Nabiki-chan is a little fussy about her possessions."</p><p>"Actually…" Ranko grimaced, "Akane and me aren't on the best of terms right now. I think I'll sleep with Auntie Saotome. By the way, if Akane comes back for some odd reason, could you tell her I said sorry?"</p><p>"Of course, Ranko," Kasumi smiled. Ranko usually slept with Akane when Auntie Saotome came to visit. What with the nature of their respective nightmares, Ranko and her mother simply weren't compatible sleep mates. "I think there's still some rope in Grandfather Happosai's room if you need help tucking yourself in." Ranma's nightmares always picked up steam when his mother was around. The rope kept anybody from getting hurt.</p><p>"Thanks, Kasumi-oneechan. I'll show Hotaru where Nabiki's room is. Are you okay, Auntie Saotome?"</p><p>"I'm fine, dear, thank you," Nodoka nodded, "I know my way around."</p><p>Ranko gave her mother one of her sad little looks, the one that showed how much she wished she could hug her mother, and be her child rather than some pseudo relative. The look was only there for a second and then it was gone, Ranma replaced it with a polite smile and bowed slightly herself before escorting "Hotaru" upstairs.</p><p>"Tofu and I are having tea, would you care to join us?" Kasumi offered.</p><p>"I wouldn't want to intrude…" Auntie Saotome said putting a hand up.</p><p>"You wouldn't be intruding. I have enough tea for everybody." Kasumi insisted.</p><p>"No thank you, I'm tired and I'd like to get every thing ready for bed early."</p><p>Kasumi smiled. Nodoka was a true Japanese. Wait to be offered three times before accepting any kindness. "If you don't accept, it will just go to waste. Please." Kasumi motioned to the kitchen.</p><p>Nodoka bowed, "Alright, maybe I will have some. There's a chill in the air tonight. Something hot might do me good."</p><p>Kasumi's conversation with Tofu had ended the moment the other's had arrived, but Kasumi hadn't liked the seriousness of it anyway. Paradoxically, having Nodoka there allowed her to be closer to Tofu. She sat next to him, leaning into him and clasping his warm, strong hand in hers. Tofu's most impressive feature was his hands. Strong enough to set a misaligned spine, delicate enough to make the most perfect of stitches.</p><p>Nodoka asked how things were going, if she and Tofu had set a date, whether Kasumi wanted children. All wonderful questions. Hopeful questions. Maybe there was no hope, but it was nice to pretend.</p><p>And Kasumi was good at pretending.</p><p>All too soon, the tea ran out, Tofu went back to the clinic, and Nodoka left to get ready for bed. Kasumi was just putting away the dishes when Ranko entered the kitchen.</p><p>"Kasumi-oneechan," she said, "do you have a minute? I need to talk with you about something."</p><p>"Certainly, Ranma-chan," Kasumi said, figuring there was enough privacy that she could drop the "Ranko".</p><p>"Kasumi I think you should know. Nabiki and me…we've changed, Kasumi. We've killed. "</p><p>"You've killed?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "I killed Copycat Ken. He killed Hoko and several other people, but he was being controlled by a demon or something. It escaped after I killed him. It was this huge segmented worm thingy with a circular mouth. I sliced through a couple of segments and there was this blue mist. It gave Nabiki the memory of killing Hoko. Copycat used her body to do it, you see, and now even though she knows she didn't do it, it doesn't matter. It still feels real."</p><p>"You two have gotten really close," Kasumi noted, concentrating on the positive aspect of what she was hearing, rather than attempting to understand it all.</p><p>Ranma nodded. "We're practically the same person. We're just specialized now. She's put all her emotions into me and I've put all my…whatever the opposite of emotions are, I put that into her. That's why she's a guy now and I'm a girl. I couldn't deal with this stuff as a guy."</p><p>"Is there more?"</p><p>"Yes. You know I'm fighting myself just to be here? Part of me wants to escape. Part of me thinks you're just a nice human who'll nonetheless try to trap me. I've joined with the Nekoken. I have control over it now, but in some ways it's worse than before. I'm afraid I might slip, go completely cat. The Thyself Known is working, I know who I am now, Kasumi, but I'm not Ranma, and Nabiki's not Nabiki. We're something different. It scares both of us." Ranma's eyes were brimming with tears. It was strange that somehow that this fragile, deadly creature had been a part of both Ranma and Nabiki, and yet neither of them would have ever acted this way before.</p><p>Then Kasumi remembered Nabiki's gun. She closed her eyes and embraced the redheaded girl. "It's okay," she said, "It's okay."</p><p>"I love you, Kasumi-oneechan. You saved my life…when I was Nabiki. I'm afraid, Kasumi. I'm so afraid I'll do something terrible."</p><p>Kasumi wasn't completely sure what Ranma was talking about now, but she held the sobbing girl close to her. "I love you too imoto-chan," she said, because it felt right. "It will be okay, little sister."</p><p>She could feel the girl relax in her embrace as her sobs began to gradually subside. They rocked back and forth in their embrace. Something clicked in Kasumi's head and she said, "No matter what happens, no matter whether you're Ranma, Ranko, Nabiki, or Hotaru, we'll always be family."</p><p>"Thank you, Kasumi-oneesama," Ranma whispered. "Thank you."</p><p>Kasumi felt the wheels of fate turn around her. If Ranma was her family, she would not be able to harm him. That could have potentially disastrous consequences. The future was still uncertain, Ranma's destiny and that of Nerima was still unclear. If Ranma fought with the demons against humanity he would be her adversary. But that was the future. For now, there was only her sister/brother who needed her love. For now, she would have faith.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>control<hr noshade="" size="1"/>The Tendo dojo was quiet and cold. Hotaru's bare feet were practically ice cubes, but he was determined to get this right. He went for a crescent kick leading up to a frenzy of punches, only instead Hotaru fell on his ass, cursing out loud, for the third time that night. It was so frustrating. He had the kata right there in his mind, but he just couldn't execute it. He didn't have the flexibility or the power, or the muscle memory. It just wasn't there.<p>He didn't have any misconceptions. Sure he had some weird abilities, like the nekoken and motorcycle stuff, but he wouldn't be any good in fight, and he was sure there were going to be fights. His ki didn't work like Ranko's. For some reason he couldn't just let it flow out of him all the time. It was either on full blast or not at all. And after he used it, it took a good minute to recover.</p><p>He had to get better. He had to or next time…</p><p>Next time he might kill someone…again.</p><p>He felt everything Ranko felt, but it was all oddly warped. He couldn't just let the feeling wash over him like she could. He had to do something. His pain converted directly into anger, and that was something else that was keeping him from performing the kata correctly. Even before Ranma received the curse it was the more, for want of a better term, feminine aspect of him that allowed him to be so graceful and to achieve the peace he attained when performing his katas. Hotaru didn't even have that now, which annoyed him even further. He had given most of his femininity to Ranko once they had gotten back so she could talk with Kasumi. He hoped it worked, and he hoped Ranko was quick about it.</p><p>Hotaru enjoyed being a man more than he had expected, but he kept running into surprising deficiencies. People just didn't realize how much they needed a balance of masculine and feminine to even function in the world.</p><p>Hotaru adopted a horse stance and punched the air to work out some frustration. He hated thinking of it as masculine and feminine energy, it seemed so sexist, but what else could he call it? If you had too much of one you were a mad person, all action and no emotion, if you had too much of the other you were a blubbering mess, all emotion and no action. He would be relieved when he could be his old self again. Sure he'd have to play Hotaru for Auntie Saotome, but he could be Nabiki in his own room couldn't he? Maybe he could leave for a bit and come back as Nabiki. But then he'd have to leave Ranko. Even at this distance from her he could feel himself slipping, he didn't know into what. He didn't want to know. He just wanted to <i>do</i> something.</p><p>The punching wasn't doing anything for him. He was about to try kicking when he heard a knock at the dojo entrance. He turned to find Shampoo and Ukyo standing in the doorway.</p><p>"What do you want?" he asked, not able to stop himself from being rude. He was a bit upset at Shampoo for trying to steal his…well that was weird wasn't it? It was the cat in him that had the problem. But while he was upset about almost losing his mate, the quarrel had been between two female cats over a male. Now Hotaru was the male and Shampoo was still female. The antagonism just didn't have any place to go. Hotaru sucked in air. If he wasn't careful, he would start to be attracted to Shampoo. She was still in heat, though she was almost out of it now.</p><p>"Who you?" Shampoo asked a little more breathily than she had probably intended.</p><p>"That depends," Hotaru hedged, "on what your intentions are."</p><p>Ukyo spoke up. "We're here to issue a challenge to Ranma Saotome and Nabiki Tendo."</p><p>"They aren't here," Hotaru snapped.</p><p>Ukyo looked at Shampoo, who was rather fixated on Hotaru, and then she looked back. "You have a cat curse or something?" She asked.</p><p>"Something like that," Hotaru allowed.</p><p>"You free tomorrow? I make too too good ramen for you. I learn to make Okonomiyaki too if like…"</p><p>Shampoo made an enticing offer. Her…assets were considerable. Not to mention her huge…tracts of land. And she had the nekoken inside her. And she was in heat. It also didn't help that Shampoo's new short hairstyle and the tight okonomiyaki chef uniform appealed to the libido Hotaru had borrowed from Ranma.</p><p>"Easy, sugar." Ukyo admonished Shampoo. "Remember, it's all pheromones."</p><p>"I like fair moan." Shampoo said in what was almost a trance. She stepped closer. "I want more fair moan."</p><p>Hotaru clenched his eyes shut. <i>Get it together. I have to control this situation. This isn't right. I'm really a girl. I'm Nabiki Tendo, this is just a s</i><i>hort term thing and besides I'm with Ranko now and…</i>Hotaru shook his head, <i>Why the hell am I even entertaining this. Just get control of the situation…just. </i>Hotaru opened his eyes. "I'll let you know how to reach Ranma and Nabiki…for a small fee."</p><p>Ukyo's eyebrow arched up. "Ah…I see. So how did you turn male, Nabiki?"</p><p><i>Damn them. Damn their feminine whiles,</i> Hotaru thought sourly.</p><p>"This…Nabiki?" Shampoo looked disgusted, but not quite disgusted enough.</p><p>Hotaru sighed. "Look, Auntie Saotome is here, so Ranma has to be Ranko. Remember Ranma's curse started changing with his thoughts? We had to do something to keep him from changing. This," Hotaru gestured to himself, "Is the result. By the way, my name's Hotaru Takahata while Auntie is here. I'm 'Ranko's' 'boyfriend'." Hotaru made quotation mark hand signs on both "Ranko" and "boyfriend."</p><p>Ukyo nodded slowly. Then a smirk appeared on her face and she finally erupted into laughter.</p><p>"What so funny?" Shampoo asked.</p><p>"Oh…" Ukyo said between guffaws, "how… the mighty…have fallen! Tendo Nabiki, the great manipulator of men forced to be Ranchan's boyfriend!"</p><p>"I wasn't exactly 'forced'" Hotaru grumbled.</p><p>"You used him for a year, but then he ended up beating you at your own game, didn't he? Ranchan never loses! 'Oh please, Nabiki, you big stud you, please help me hide from my mother, won't you?'" Ukyo put on the act, batting her eyes impressively.</p><p>When she stopped, though, Ukyo was serious. "Nabiki, or Hotaru or whoever you want to be. You…are a jackass. You had this whole mystique going, like you knew everything. But you didn't, did you? The only thing you had going was that you didn't get involved. You were Switzerland, and you held everybody's bank accounts. Well the bank's closed now, sugar. You're going to war."</p><p>"Ranko loves me, and I love her. There's no war going on. It's all been decided already," Hotaru countered, but it sounded weak even before Ukyo responded.</p><p>"Funny. That's what I said just before Ranchan…RANMA and his father ran off with my dowry. And having to watch him with Akane and Shampoo…But it was all okay, because he loved me and I loved him. And then one night I see him fucking Miss Switzerland on the evening news. Well I think I'm owed a little vengeance. And Shampoo over here, she's got a nice little score to settle too…as soon as she gets out of the bucket of shit pickles her curse has forced her into anyway."</p><p>Ukyo took a piece of paper out of the flap of her uniform and stuck it to the side of the dojo entrance with a throwing spatula. "So, if you happen to see Tendo Nabiki or Saotome Ranma, you tell them to meet us in two weeks at the abandoned lot, in their correct forms, or else they'll be revealed as the honorless, jackass, shitfaced, bastard fucks they are."</p><p>Ukyo turned and left, dragging Shampoo along with her. She had walked almost out of eyesight in the night before Hotaru snapped out of his daze. "Oh…Oh yeah?" he called out, "Well, I never liked your okonomiyaki anyway!" Not quite satisfied with this, he cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled "It tastes like paper maché!"</p><p>Even after the two former fiancees were gone, Ukyo's words continued to linger in the air. Nabiki would have been able to handle that situation so much better. But Hotaru wasn't Nabiki anymore. He looked around the dojo. <i>Why am I here? This isn't me. </i></p><p>He looked at his hand, wider, less graceful than his normal one, and felt a surge of panic. He tried turning female, but he couldn't. Ranko took too much. The room seemed to spin. Energy built up within him. <i>I've got to hold on to it, </i>he thought desperately, <i>I can't let it go or I could die. </i>But his control was slipping. A green light sputtered around him and then grew like a flame all over his body.</p><p>A second before he passed out, he realized he was no longer touching the floor.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>author's note<hr noshade="" size="1"/>This SHOULD be the final version. Sorry it took so long. Thanks to everyone who gave comments. And if you're still with me after all this time, then thank you for your patience. As soon as they invent a machine that can stop time I'll be able to pump these suckers out at you. Until then...<p>If you like my writing, you should know that I am now published. A short story of mine, titled <i>Company Positions</i> made it onto a print magazine called <i>The First Line</i>. You can buy it online at double U double U double U dot thefirstline dot com. in the Fall 2007 issue. You can get an issue for about three bucks and there's a whole bunch of interesting stories in there, not just mine. There's one about a professor's thoughts during a terrorist takeover and another about a man who gets into trouble for making up verbs. My story is about a future where there are only five companies and they have taken over the world. Good stuff. If you do not like my writing and are only reading this for some strange, masochistic thrill, you might want to check it out anyway. I've heard a rumor from a swarthy old man with a salt and pepper beard I met once in a pub near the Baltimore harbor that hidden in the pages of one of the issues of The First Line is a map to the famous Fountain of Youth saught by Ponce de Leon and counless others. Apparently it's somewhere in Plano, Texas. Who knew. Anyway, if you do not buy a copy of the magazine you will never know the secret.</p><p>Of course you probably won't ever know the secret anyway. But there's always a chance. You could always wait for Darth Vader to knock on your door. There are probably equal opportunities of either thing happening. But ask yourself, would you rather know where the fountain of Youth is? Or would you rather meet Darth Vader? And I don't mean James Earl Jones, or some kid in a DV costume, I mean pissed off, used to be a whiny asshole, choke you with his mind Darth. And no, you don't get a lightsaber or jedi powers. Um...dang it. Still seems cooler to see Darth Vader. Okay imagine a gigantic wooden badger falling on you from a great distance. That's what may happen if you don't buy the Fall 07 issue of The First Line. Course it may happen anyway. It might not happen at all. But are you willing to take that risk? Even now as you read this there could be a team of over productive wasps building a nest out of wood pulp in the shape of a badger up in the clouds directly above your home. It's not likely, but it's POSSIBLE. That's all I'm saying.</p><p>I plan to keep on writing fanfiction as long as people continue to comment on my stuff. It may take me a while, but I'll get it done. Hope you enjoyed this chapter and hopefully I can get the next chapter done more quickly for you guys.</p><p>It gets weirder.</p><p>10/6/07 finishing touches.</p><p>8/23/07 Did some major editing. Not as bad as I thought, though.</p><p>2/3/07 Fixed Grave of the Fireflies reference and word wrapped txt version for ffml</p><p>1/18/07- First draft was actually done pretty quickly, but I got some sobering critiques.</p>
