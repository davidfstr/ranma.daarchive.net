Here's the current  situation: Nabiki is currently a male version of herself and has been  infected with a highly exaggerated form of Ranma's masculine  identity. Ranma has reverted to a highly exaggerated form of his  feminine identity. They are trying to catch a doppelganger who killed  four people, including Gosunkugi, and Nabiki's best friend Hoko.</p><p>Hiro  Kawagami is a police officer who recently saved Nabiki's life.  Copycat used his blanket to turn Hiro into a physical copy of Hoko,  but Hiro has latent magical abilities which kept the eyes from  changing color and which allow Hiro to talk with Hoko. Detective  Inamura is Hiro's boss and friend, and also the father of Nabiki and  Hoko's friend Ami. Nabiki and Hoko both think of Inamura as a kooky  uncle.</p><p>-Ch.  9: Second Chances-</p><p>"But I cannot grow<br/>till you eat the last of me<br/>oh when will I be free<br/>and  you, a parasite<br/>just find another host<br/>just another stool to  post<br/>cause you, my tapeworm tells me what to do<br/>you!<br/>my  tapeworm tells me where to go</p><p>Pull the tapeworm out of your  ass…"</p><p>-System of a Down-  Needles</p><p>-an  alley in nerima-</p><p>Ranko  tried to stop the tears, but they kept flowing hot, wet, and slow,  like blood from a newly opened wound. The recently male Nabiki was  driving the police motorcycle at unreal speeds, and Ranko sat behind  him embracing her fiance's stomach as tightly as she comfortably  could. She couldn't help noticing how little muscle he had. He was  pretty well toned, but Nabiki wouldn't be able to take a well-placed  hit from Akane, much less someone like Ryoga. The doppelganger they  were chasing looked to be at Ryoga's level or greater based on how it  moved. She couldn't let Nabiki face that much danger. Ranko would  have to fight it. Alone.</p><p>The  trouble was, she didn't want to fight anybody. She was sick of all  the fighting. The fiancées, Ryoga, Akane, her father... she  cared for them all and yet all she had ever done was fight them. It  was stupid and she had known it for some time, even when she had been  a boy. All she wanted to do now was stop all the pointless violence  and start living life instead of attacking it. But now Nabiki was  going after this murderer, this demon, and Ranko was the only one who  could protect him.</p><p>Nabiki  was acting just like Ranma would have. Charging into battle,  thinking, KNOWING he would win. Ranko knew this, but all she could  think of just then was that if she didn't do something, there was a  very good chance Nabiki would die.</p><p>Ranko  jerked forward into Nabiki's back as the motorcycle skidded to a halt  in the alleyway. "FUCK!" Nabiki said.</p><p>"What?"  Ranko asked, her voice wavering a little from the crying.</p><p>"I  made a deal with him. Why the hell did I have to make a deal with  him?"</p><p>"You're  not making any sense." Ranko put her chin on Nabiki's shoulder,  hugging him closer to her.</p><p>Nabiki  glanced at her out of the corner of his eye. "You're crying."  It was almost an accusation.</p><p>"I'm  sorry, I couldn't help it. I'll be okay once we get there. I just..."</p><p>Nabiki's  hands left the handlebars and held Ranko's arms across his waist. His  hands were warm. Warm, but too soft. "We can't fight him. Not  now. Later when we both aren't so screwed up, we'll kill the bastard,  but not now."</p><p>"What  is it?"</p><p>Nabiki  closed his eyes, "When you were in prison and I was trying to  get to you, I made a deal with the doppelganger to have him help me  get away. It was stupid. Stupid and completely useless because  Inamura-sensei let me go anyway after I explained to him what was  going on. But I still made the deal. And now I can't break it."</p><p>Ranko  was about to ask "Why not?" but then she felt what Nabiki  was going through. All of the masculine pride that Ranma had  unconsciously forced into Nabiki a couple hours ago was now screaming  at Nabiki to follow his word, to uphold his honor. Ranko knew that  sort of thinking was stupid. Even when she was Ranma she had been  able to sacrifice honor to keep himself or someone else out of  danger, but Nabiki no longer had a sense of prudence to combat his  sense of honor. That had all been forced into Ranko.</p><p>Ranko  took a shuddering breath and let it out. "What was the deal?"  she asked.</p><p>"That  I would at some time give him a chance to kill you without  obstructing him in any way. It made sense at the time because I knew  he had pretended to be Hoko and they were questioning me about her  murder. If she came in, apparently alive, I could have left to save  you and I would have found a way around the deal later. But then  Inamura-sensei let me go before the doppelganger came in and it all  got mixed up after that."</p><p>"Then  we have to keep going."</p><p>Nabiki  opened his eyes. "What?"</p><p>"I'm  at my weakest right now. If there's any chance of you keeping your  word it's now."</p><p>"Are  you crazy? He'll kill you!"</p><p>Ranko  snorted some mucus back up her nose and wiped the rest off with her  sleeve. "Maybe…" her mouthed curved into a shadow of her  usual smirk, "but if you don't give him his chance my stupid  sense of honor will keep screwing with you, and you won't be able to  fight him at all."</p><p>"I  don't like it. You're not trying to sacrifice yourself to protect me  or anything like that are you?"</p><p>"I  just want you to be able to fight him...if you have to. I mean…if I  can't defeat him…" Ranko knew Nabiki stood no chance of  beating the doppelganger, she also knew that letting him think he  could was the only way to win this argument. Ranko wasn't sure if she  stood a chance either. It was simply not in her to fight right now.  Maybe the doppelganger could be reasoned with…</p><p>Nabiki  slumped for a moment, thinking. "It doesn't matter anyway,"  he said finally. "I've lost him by now."</p><p>Ranma  heard a clang of metal. She whipped her head up toward the fire  escape above them and saw the cold glint of a gun barrel. "Nabiki!  DUCK!" Ranko shoved the cycle toward the the shooter, hoping  that Nabiki would follow the movement.</p><p>A  bullet sped through the air above them as Nabiki and Ranko fell with  the motorcycle. The bullet would have killed at least one of them if  they hadn't moved. If they moved away from the shooter, the bullet  would have likely killed them both. Now, just as long as they stayed  low, the fire escape would offer some cover.</p><p>"I  don't know who you are," Nabiki said as he got up and ran to the  bottom of the fire escape. "But no one shoots at my fiancée!"</p><p>"Nabiki,  no!" Ranko yelled and tried to catch him</p><p>"You're  not exactly honoring our agreement, are you Nabiki? Protecting her  like this?" a voice called from the fire escape as Ranko  followed Nabiki up the stairs but just  as Nabiki was getting up, another shot rang out. The bullet slammed  into his chest, knocking him  down into Ranko's arms.</p><p>Ranko  screamed. In the next moment, moving frantically, she grabbed Nabiki  and jumped down the stairs and below the first landing of the fire  escape. She was only marginally safer here, but she paused a moment  to look at Nabiki's wound. Blood was gurgling out of it.</p><p>"I  can't…" Nabiki wheezed</p><p>The  bullet went through his right lung. Nabiki couldn't breathe. Ranko  had to think of something. Fast.</p><p>-furinkan  high school, assistant principal's office-</p><p>Akane  couldn't be happier. The assistant principal had finally returned  with the permission form after only an hour and a half of waiting. He  looked just as relieved as Akane when they were done signing. He had  actually told Akane thank you.</p><p>"Why  are you thanking me?" Akane had asked.</p><p>"Usually  someone will try to help and I'll have to keep them away from the  booby traps or help them out of piles of fruit. I'm a little  addle-brained anyway, trying to help someone else really increases  the time." The assistant principle was about forty years old,  but had a mussed up schoolboy haircut. He had dark circles under his  eyes and coffee stains on his shirt and tie.</p><p>"Thank  you, Hitomagi-san," Cologne said, breaking Akane's stunned  silence.</p><p>"Ah,  yes, thank you, sensei." Akane bowed.</p><p>"You're  welcome, Akage-chan."</p><p>"Oh,  my name is Akane," Akane corrected with a smile.</p><p>"Nice  to meet you, Akane, how may I help?" the assistant principal  asked.</p><p>The  guy was almost as bad as Nabiki's history teacher! <i>Honestly</i>,  Akane thought, <i>couldn't he remember my name for just five seconds?</i>  But then she took a breath, let it out, and said "Just  introducing myself, Hitomagi-sensei. I hope you have a nice day."  She bowed and left the office with Cologne hopping behind her on her  gnarled wooden staff.</p><p>When  they were outside the school grounds Cologne stopped and turned to  Akane. "You did well, girl. For all your squirming, you still  managed to compose yourself. Patience is not a skill you can learn in  one sitting however." Cologne stepped down from her staff, and  started walking slowly. It was difficult for Akane to match her  speed. She kept wanting to rush ahead of the old woman. "Patience  is an art form in itself," Cologne continued, "It is not  simply about not moving when one is not supposed to move, it is about  knowing when to move, and how. You must know as much as possible  about your situation."</p><p>Akane  was only half paying attention as she was still trying to match the  Amazon elder's pace. Cologne halted suddenly causing her to stumble a  little as she tried to stop.</p><p>"Did  you meet with your assistant principal before today?"</p><p>"Huh?  No. Well, I've seen him in the hall before once or twice but he's  pretty reclusive most of the time." Akane answered.</p><p>"I  have tea with him and his wife sometimes. I get much of my  information on what happens in the school from him. Also, that is how  I knew how trying he can be."</p><p>"Oh."  Akane said.</p><p>Cologne  started walking down the street again. Akane followed, paying more  attention to her now. "Your sisters know a great deal about  patience: Kasumi shows it in caring for your family like she does,  and for so many years; Nabiki in maintaining the finances for her  exploits, and gathering information. They are both very powerful  women, even at such a young age and with only minimal training in the  martial arts."</p><p>"Yeah.  Nabiki's real patient. She certainly took her time tearing off  Ranma's clothes so she could fuck him in the middle of the street!"  Akane regretted the words as soon as she said them. But seeing that  on television hurt and the wounds were still too fresh.</p><p>"You're  jealous of her."</p><p>"No  I'm not." Akane argued, "If I were jealous I'd want  something she had. I don't want Ranma. She can have the jerk!"  Taking a breath she said with more calmness. "Maybe Ranma and I  had something once, but it was gone long before Nabiki did what she  did."</p><p>"You're  jealous of Nabiki, and you're also jealous of Kasumi."</p><p>"Huh?  I'm not jealous of Kasumi, what would make you think that?"</p><p>"I  seem to recall a story about how you used to have long hair because  you wanted to be like her. I also seem to recall something to the  effect that you once had a crush on the boy doctor."</p><p>"Who  told you that?" Akane yelled stepping in front of the Amazon  elder.</p><p>Cologne  looked up and away from Akane nonchalantly, her staff in her folded  arms. "I overheard your friends Yuka and Sayuri talking about  you in the Nekohanten."</p><p>"Oh."  Akane said, deflated. "But I'm over that now. I mean...well,  okay, sometimes I wonder just how it is that Kasumi gets treated like  a saint when all she does is cook and clean and act like a ditz."</p><p>"Tell  me, girl" Cologne looked Akane in the eyes. "What have YOU  done?"</p><p>Akane  tried to think of some response as the little old woman walked past  her. "I helped Ranma!" she remembered, "I've helped  him out plenty of times."</p><p>Cologne  turned and climbed on her staff. "You have a good heart, child,  but it gets clouded by your quick temper. You did well today, but  only because I was there to guide you. You must use this vacation to  improve on this weakness of yours."</p><p>"I  will," Akane promised.</p><p>"The  reason you're jealous of your sisters, is that they have patience  while you do not. You're jealous of Ranma for the same reason."</p><p>"Ranma  is NOT patient."</p><p>"I  agree. He is not. Compared to you though, he's a stone. And you  never denied that you were jealous of him." Cologne gave Akane a  wicked smile.</p><p>Akane  furrowed her brow, "I don't get it. How could I be jealous of  their patience?"</p><p>"Child,  remember that when I speak of patience I speak not only of the  ability to wait, but of the ability to act when it is required…to  do what is prudent at a given time even when you are not inclined to.   In order to possess this ability you must first know what must be  done, which requires that you know as much as possible about your  surroundings…and yourself. Ranma is conflicted over many things,  and because of this, he sometimes acts irrationally. But Ranma knows  one thing about himself for certain, and that has seen him through  many hardships. Ranma knows he is a martial artist. He knows how to  think as a martial artist. He knows how to act as a martial artist.  He knows when, as a martial artist, he must stand down."</p><p>"I'm  a martial artist too, you know." Akane snapped back.</p><p>"No,  child, you are not. You sometimes wish you were, just as you  sometimes wish you could cook and be as equanimous as Kasumi, or even  manipulate people the way that Nabiki can, but the truth is you can  do none of these things. You lack the patience that is required.</p><p>"You  practice martial arts, and you have a proficiency, true, but you are  not a martial artist until the Art has become a part of your soul,  until it becomes an integral part of everything you think and do. I  have seen you mock Ranma's code. I have seen you intrude on the  battles of others, and I have only seen you train seriously when you  were forced by circumstance to do so. You are not a martial artist."  Cologne turned away from Akane, craning her head back, she said one  last thing before bounding off across the rooftops: "Not yet."</p><p>Akane  stood on the sidewalk for several moments, thinking. She wanted to  protest what Cologne had said, but the words kept sticking to her and  she couldn't shake them off. Maybe she wasn't really a martial  artist. But then what was she? Answers kept floating to the surface  of her brain, but there was nothing she could hold on to, nothing she  could grab hold of and say "This is me." And then slowly  something new came to her.</p><p>"I'm  an Amazon warrior now," Akane remembered. She didn't know how to  coerce people into doing what she wanted, all she knew was how to hit  them, but she would learn. Cologne was an expert. She didn't know how  to cook or hold her temper, but if she worked long enough at the  Nekohanten, she would learn that too. And if she took this  opportunity to train, to hone her skills and attempt to learn new  ones, she'd be on her way to being a true martial artist, maybe  eventually even better than Ranma.</p><p>Akane  raise her head up higher. She wasn't out of the woods yet. Not by a  long shot. Still, she felt she had a way out now. She had been  confused about Ranma for the longest time. She loved him, she hated  him. She was his friend, his fiancée. Now it was clear to her.  Ranma was her rival.</p><p>Akane  rushed to her house to shove her gi and a set of weights into her  duffle bag, putting them with the other things she had already  packed. Then, she changed clothes and jogged, the heavy duffle bag  jostling around her, seven blocks to Yuka's house. She was  breathless, but smiling as she knocked and waited at the door. She  would wait as long as necessary.</p><p>After  about a minute, Akane heard Sayuri call from behind her. "Hey,  Akane! What are you doing?"</p><p>"I'm…er…waiting."</p><p>"Um…okay.  Don't pop your lid or anything, but we're supposed to meet Yuka and  her Dad in their garage, something about a new invention her uncle  came up with. Oh, and her uncle's coming too, I hope that's okay."</p><p>Akane's  eyebrow twitched just a little. For a brief moment she almost got  just the tiniest bit angry at having to wait so long by the door when  Yuka had TOLD her that she'd be in the house…But she took a deep  breath and let it pass. It was okay. She was going to have a fun time  at the beach with her friends and get some training in while she was  at it. Even Yuka's STUPID Uncle with his BRAIN DEAD inventions wasn't  going to ruin that.</p><p>"That's…fine."  Akane said. "I'll meet you back there in just a bit. I've got to  take care of something."</p><p>"Okey  dokey, Annie Oakley. I'll let them know you're here."</p><p>After  Sayuri left. Akane opened her duffle bag. Then she stuck her head in  the bag and screamed into the cloth of her gi.</p><p>Composing  herself, Akane took a breath. She would learn patience on this trip.  She would train, hone her skills, and learn patience. She was an  Amazon after all. She wasn't out of the woods yet, but now at least,  she had a path.</p><p>-  fire escape -</p><p>Copycat  stood on the fire escape looking down at the scene below him in  astonishment. He had shot Nabiki. Just...shot her, or him, or  whatever. It had been so easy. A pull of the trigger and Nabiki, male  for some reason Copycat hadn't quite figured out yet, was on his back  writhing and holding his chest, dark red blood already staining his  fingers. …<i>still alive…not for long though.</i></p><p>Ranma  was crying over him like, well like a girl. Something had certainly  happened between the two. Copycat wasn't sure what. <i>Ranma's open  now,</i> he realized,<i> I could run down the steps and shoot her in  the head no problem.</i></p><p>Killing  Ranma would be easy as bleeding right now. And while Nabiki might not  be dead just yet, that bullet had to have at least punctured a lung.  Death would come in a few hours if there wasn't any medical  attention. He had practically killed Nabiki already.</p><p>Why  was he having trouble with that?</p><p>Why  couldn't he move now, after killing so many people to get to this  moment?</p><p>Maybe  it was too easy? Copycat sighed. Yes, that could be it. It was such a  letdown after all the buildup. But if that was it, what exactly did  he want? He knew he'd lose in a fight with Ranma. He could only hope  to outwit the pigtailed prick, the only thing blocking that for the  longest time had been Nabiki. Whom he had just killed...basically.  Now was his chance, he had to take it. He rushed to the steps and  almost ran down them, but still he held back.</p><p>Ranma  was saying something into Nabiki's ear now, apparently oblivious to  the threat above her. <i>Go! Go down there and shoot the bastard,  damn it!</i> But he couldn't. He wanted Ranma to suffer as he had  suffered. He wanted Ranma to understand what had happened to him. He  wanted the bitch to <i>feel</i> it. He didn't want to kill Ranma, he  wanted Ranma to beg for death.</p><p>But...he  wanted Nabiki alive too. Nabiki had been the great obstacle blocking  him for so long. He wanted to conquer her, to let her know he was  better than her. For her to die like this was just...well...it  sucked.</p><p><i>It's  too late now. Just finish it</i>. Copycat nodded solemnly. He walked  slowly down the steps to the ground behind his prey. He would finish  it. He would kill Ranma, and then, he would kill himself.</p><p>Ranma  was just standing up. Copycat would wait for her to face him, and  then he would shoot her between her eyes. It would be over then. It  would all be over.</p><p>Ranma  turned. Her eyes seemed to burn with cold, blue fire. Copycat smiled,  <i>Probably going to use some new technique. Let's see if it can stop  bullets.</i> He fired the pistol and jumped to the left to avoid  whatever Ranma hoped to throw at him.</p><p>The  sound of the retort came a fraction of a second after Ranma yelled,  "Tobu Sennuki!"</p><p>Flying  corkscrew.</p><p>As  Copycat tucked and rolled away from Ranma's attack, there was a  crashing sound coupled with the sound of squealing metal on metal. It  took Copycat a moment to realize that the fire escape was falling  toward him, along with quite a few bricks and pieces of mortar.. He  scrambled desperately out of the way of the rapidly deteriorating  structure, narrowly missing a skewering by one of the pieces of  twisted metal.</p><p>When  the dust cleared, Ranma was standing beside a massive pile of debris,  her eyes burning into him. She was so short she almost had the look  of a petulant child, but her aura was frightening. It grew blacker  and blacker, stealing energy from the air until it grew so cold  Copycat could see his breath.</p><p>Ranma  was alive. Copycat didn't have time to figure out why he was happy  about that. He had just enough time to change his form to male Ranma,  extend ki claws from his hands and swipe.</p><p>-alley-</p><p>The  tears came gushing out of Ranko's eyes and she couldn't make them  stop. This was not the time for crying. This was the time for getting  the hell away from the serial killer and getting Nabiki to a  hospital. But she couldn't stop. <i>It's too much. I'm too much of a  girl now. But what can I do?</i></p><p>An  image of Happosai sitting with a broken leg beside a felled tree in  the Tendo yard floated up into her consciousness. <i>"You're  feeling pretty feminine right now, aren't you?"</i> he had asked  her that morning only yesterday. Feminine ki...</p><p>Wiping  the tears from her eyes, Ranko embraced Nabiki. She spoke into his  ear. "You're probably feeling pretty manly right now. You want  to get up and keep fighting right?"</p><p>Nabiki  tried to speak, but blood gurgled in his wound when he breathed in.</p><p>"Don't  do that!" Ranko cried. "Just listen for a second. I want  you to try to focus all your manliness into your right hand. You hear  me? Just push it all into that one place."</p><p>Ranko  closed her eyes and tried to imagine a completely female apple. It  would have all the nutrients and life force of an apple, but it  wouldn't have any rigidity. It wouldn't have any clear boundaries  either. It would be substance completely devoid of form.</p><p>Ranko  put all her feelings of acceptance, of caring, of weakness, of fear,  into creating the completely female apple in her hand. She held her  hand over Nabiki's and took in the denial, the harshness, the  strength and the bravery that she found there.</p><p>She  envisioned the apple gaining structure, becoming real. There was a  weight now in her hand. Ranko let it drop.</p><p>"Eat  that," she told Nabiki, "It will heal you. I saw Happosai  do it."</p><p>Ranko  got to her feet. She felt weak now, light-headed. It didn't matter. A  shot had been fired. Eyes squeezed shut, Ranko stood before Akane  holding the pistol. It was her memory as much as it had ever been  Nabiki's. She felt her trigger finger tighten. She wanted to kill.  Ranko's eyes opened once more. If she killed this nameless  shapeshifter would it be any different from killing Akane? Or Nabiki?</p><p>Her  ki was dark. The air grew cold around her as her body desperately  tried to fill the void in her soul with warmth and prana from her  environment. There are some voids that cannot be filled, however.  Some problems that keep returning after they're solved. Second  chances to make a bad decision.</p><p>She  didn't have to do this. She could get away now. She could run off  with Nabiki, give herself enough time to find a better way out of  this. But she knew that wasn't going to happen. The trigger had  already been pulled. As soon as that bullet hit Nabiki's chest, this  became a battle to the death.</p><p>Ranko  glared at the fake policeman just coming down from fire escape. She  moved her arms in a circle, mixing her cold ki with the relatively  hot ki of the air around her. The figure raised the pistol toward  her. A bullet fired from the barrel a fraction of a second after the  words "Tobu Sennuki!" fired out of Ranko's lips. A  horizontal tornado of ki-strengthened wind ripped and twisted through  the metal fire escape, making a horrible screeching and moaning  sound. The bullet ricocheted off a manhole cover farther down the  alley.</p><p>The  shapeshifter jumped away from Ranko's first attack and was almost  covered in the debris from the building. He landed next to Ranko. She  turned to face him, planning her attack.</p><p>Grabbing  a blanket, seemingly from nowhere, Ranko's enemy changed, in an  instant, into a copy of male Ranma. The changeover was somehow  familiar, but Ranko couldn't quite put her finger on it.</p><p>There  was Ranko's male self, confident, smirking, male, but her expression  did not change. It would go against the Art. It would go against her  honor. She didn't care. This thing, in whatever form it took, was  going to die.</p><p>Strong,  sharp lines of ki descended slightly from the shapeshifter's fists.  <i>Nekoken, </i>Ranko registered, but she took no time to wonder at  how the monster knew the technique. She jumped above the  shapeshifter's slash and threw another Tobu Sennuki down at him. The  move tore the asphalt from the ground below her, but the doppelganger  managed to escape everything but a few blows from the debris.</p><p>Then  he started convulsing. He threw his head back and his body forward,  then his body went the opposite way. He shook violently. His fists  opened and closed. He screamed.</p><p>This  made Ranko pause for a moment, but at this point, she really didn't  give a fuck if the bastard was epileptic. Gathering ki, she prepared  to release another Tobu Sennuki. Before she could finish it, however,  the shapeshifter lunged at her in an unmistakable nekoken move.</p><p>Ranko  barely managed to dodge in time. She jumped to the wall of the  closest building, narrowly avoiding another attack. She launched off  the wall onto the roof of the building with the ruined fire escape to  gain some distance. The shapeshifter started convulsing again, this  time collapsing to the pavement and scratching deep gouges with the  ki claws, the asphalt curling away like it were chiseled wood, then  crumbling into piles of black after breaking contact with the ki.</p><p>She  wouldn't be able to match the speed of a full-fledged nekoken. If she  got off a lucky shot with the Tobu Sennuki she <i>might</i> be able  to end it, but it would take too long to set it up, and it was  getting harder and harder to maintain her heart of ice in the  pressure of the battle. She could feel her cat self ready to take  over, she knew it was the only way to beat the shapeshifter now, but  she hesitated.</p><p>This  would be only the second time in eleven years she ever purposely let  the cat take over. Her fear of cats could bring it out of her, and  yesterday Shampoo and Nabiki, two other people with the nekoken,  caused her to switch over without even realizing it. But there had  only been one other time she'd ever switched over on purpose, without  the fear.</p><p>The  day Ranma had almost killed his father.</p><p>-eleven  years ago-</p><p>Ranma  lay down in the pit, unable to move. It was too dark to see anything.  He could only...hear...feel...smell.</p><p>It  wasn't the cats at first. The only time they scratched or bit was  when they fought each other. They never attacked him. There was no  reason to. They nibbled the fish off of him. They rubbed against him.  They purred.</p><p>Initially,  it was the dark, the not being able to move. His mind would conjure  up images to fill the blankness of his vision. Hallucinations that  blew every touch of fur, every purring sound out of proportion until  it was something else…something more powerful and sinister.</p><p>The  first two times Ranma was all for the training. The third was when he  first asked his father to stop. Usually Genma would taunt Ranma a  little if he didn't want to do a training technique but eventually  let it go. Not this time. He threw Ranma in the third time. And Ranma  cried.</p><p>He  didn't understand.</p><p>While  in the pit, his mind went everywhere. He felt at times like he was  covered in a giant, vibrating blanket. Then, sometimes he felt like  he could catch words or phrases in the sounds he heard. A touch of  fur and he would wonder for a moment whether it was his skin touching  the fur or his fur touching the skin. He pondered this for a minute  or so and then when he finally remembered why the idea was ridiculous  he found the thought so disturbing he moaned.</p><p>He  begged Genma not to put him back in the pit the fourth time. Genma  just got angrier, he called him a girl, he said he was going to  disown him. Ranma at that point was so frightened of the pit that he  ran away, rather than go back there again. But Genma caught him, tied  him up and threw him in again. He said it was the only way for him to  get over his phobia.</p><p>Back  in the darkness Ranma became convinced that Genma was not his father  anymore. Somehing had possessed his father, eaten his soul. It was a  large, female, humanoid cat figure. Her name was Ba Shiteto. She  nibbled at Genma's soul, like the cats nibbled at the fish tied to  Ranma's body. Or were they nibbling his body? Ba Shiteto batted at  the soul from time to time with a hand with silver claws. Ranma  wondered then whether it was really Genma's soul or his own.  Sometimes the soul took the form of a tanto held by the unsheathed  metal tip. Other times it was a daikatana. Still others, Ba Shiteto  held the soul by a tail and the soul would bat back with little  claws, like a kitten.</p><p>This  time, when Genma took him out again, Ranma didn't even try to reason  with him, he just bolted. It took Genma longer this time, but once  again he caught Ranma. Once again he yelled at him, called him names,  tied him up tight and threw him in the pit.</p><p>In  the black, Ranma could see that Genma wasn't his father anymore. He  was a zombie. A flesh golem. A monster. If he wanted to escape he had  to defeat him. But he couldn't. He was just a boy. A normal man he  might have managed maybe, but not a martial arts master like his  father. Even if it wasn't really his father. Ba Shiteto rubbed in  between his ears and said that there was a way but that Ranma would  have to let go of his humanity and become what he was meant to be. "I  don't understand," Ranma responded, "I'm not human, I'm a  cat."</p><p>Only  this came out as a terrible yowl/scream. "That's very good,"  Ba Shiteto said, "Just remember that, and you'll be fine."</p><p>Genma  pulled him out again and this time Ranma didn't move. Genma gave him  food and water. Ranma chased after a grasshopper. Genma asked if  Ranma was okay. Ranma said nothing. Genma asked if he really didn't  want to go through with the training. Ranma was distracted by a  butterfly. Everything was okay until Genma tied him up again. Ranma  started struggling. "You had your chance, boy," Genma said  and threw him back in the pit.</p><p>Ranma  yowled. Ranma spat. Ranma ripped through his bonds and leapt to the  edge of the pit. Ba Shiteto was right. He had to get rid of the  human. He could find food somewhere else. Ranma knocked his father  down. Genma was saying something with a happy voice, but Ranma didn't  understand it. Ranma picked Genma up with his mouth and flung him in  the air. He batted him with his paws. This was easy!</p><p>He  soon grew tired of playing with the human though, who by that time  had fallen unconscious. He was about to slice his head off when he  paused. There was a remnant of his humanity whispering to him. "<i>What  if this is the real Pops</i>?" He couldn't break out of the cat  mentality, but he couldn't finish the blow either. Something was  scaring him, creating an emotion so deep it affected him even through  the nekoken. It was the real fear behind every fear he felt in the  pit. A fear of losing...something. He couldn't make sense of it. All  he knew was that something was scaring him.</p><p>Ranma  did what most animals do when frightened. He froze. Then he ran.</p><p>After  he recovered, he didn't remember anything. A vague sense of the pit,  nothing else. That's what he told himself at night, when the  nightmares came. Because if he remembered it…if he accepted what he  had almost done...</p><p>-present-</p><p>Things  were different now. Genma was no longer the center of Ranko's life.  Nabiki was. They were both under the nekoken when they made love in  the middle of the city. She remembered being a cat. She remembered  enjoying it. Now her cat side was inextricably entwined with who she  was.</p><p>But  there was still a boundary Ranko still hadn't quite crossed. And now,  in the seconds as she contemplated how she would attack this monster  before her that wore her face, even as her own ki claws slid slowly  from her knuckles and she lowered into a more feral stance, she felt  the fear. If she continued, she would lose something precious to her.  She paused for a moment. But the situation was different. If killing  the monster meant losing something... then it was lost the moment  Nabiki was shot.</p><p>The  monster screamed again from the rooftop across the alley, contorting  itself into a new position. Ranko suddenly knew what was wrong with  it. It tried somehow to steal the nekoken. It had tried to take the  power without knowing its true nature. It was like one of those dogs  that do tricks for the human folk. It did not know what it was.</p><p>Ranko  crouched low. Her soul of ice evaporated. Her ki claws were now fully  extended from her hands as she watched the wretched thing writhe.  This was the creature that had attacked her mate? She would kill it,  and because she was feeling a little hungry, perhaps she'd eat a  little off its flesh.</p><p>She  lunged toward the shapeshifter, eagerly anticipating an easy kill.</p><p>-nerima  prefecture police department-</p><p>Hiro  didn't seem to have anything else to do. Copycat was long gone, and  he wasn't sure what he'd do if he could reach him anyway. How could  he even tell him from anybody else? So he followed Inamura to the  morgue. He hated corpses. He hated death of any kind really, but at  the moment he NEEDED to do something he hated... just to reconnect  with the world. He felt more like stabbing himself repeatedly with a  rusty blade, but going to a morgue would do in pinch. Less messy  anyway.</p><p>-<i>You  still there?-</i> he thought out to Hoko.</p><p>-<i>Yeah.  I'm feeling a little stupid right now. Should have remembered he  could heal with that blanket of his. I could have warned you.-</i></p><p><i>-You're  just a girl. You didn't know any better,- </i>Hiro consoled.</p><p>-<i>Yeah,  well, you're just a girl now too. Besides, you're what, 7 years older  than me? I guess that makes you a wise old man.- </i>Hiro could sense  Hoko rolling her non-existent eyes.</p><p>Before  Hiro could think of a response, he was interrupted by the blast of  cold air as he entered the morgue.</p><p>Immediately  he regretted coming.</p><p>All  the bodies were locked into silver drawers in the wall, out of sight.  But Hiro could feel them like a worm sliding through his intestines.  He could hear them in the back of his mind like a musical ensemble  comprised of dentists' drills and nails on chalkboard.</p><p>"Be  quick about this, Inamura," Hiro half-shouted against the din,  the high pitch of his voice making it sound almost like a scream,  "I'm really not good around dead bodies."</p><p>"On  the contrary, Kawagami-kun." Inamura turned back slightly,  looking down at him out of the corner of his eye, "Your problem  is that you ARE good around dead bodies. A little too good. You're in  that body, but I knew who you were as soon as you and the  doppelganger entered the precinct. You know why?"</p><p>Hiro  shook his head.</p><p>"Your  eyes. Light blue, the irises almost white themselves. They're  sensitive. They see things that others do not." He took a puff  from his cigarette, almost completely covering his goateed mouth with  his hand in the movement. He let out the smoke. "I know why you  left your old precinct, Kawagami." He turned back around and  walked to one of the drawers. "'Arasu, poru Yoriku!'"  Inamura said, seeming to quote something as he rolled out the  cadaver. "Ah nu hin, Horasho.'"</p><p>"What?"  Hiro asked.</p><p>"It's  English. Shakespeare actually," Inamura informed.</p><p>Hiro  shook his head. "I've only ever read Romeo and Juliet. And that  was a Japanese translation."</p><p>"There's  a scene where Hamlet, a young prince, finds the grave of a fool that  once played with him when he was a child, and laments the passing of  happier times." Inamura pulled back the cloth covering the  corpse. "This fool… was my brother."</p><p>The  corpse was hardly anything more than a skeleton. The bones were held  together by dark brown and gray leathery skin, the whole pitiful  sight looking like an unwrapped mummy long forgotten, like a picture  Hiro had seen of a man that had been frozen in ice for thousands of  years. The chill of the morgue seemed to intensify at the thought.  Hiro wondered just how long the man before him had been dead.</p><p>The  corpse sat up.</p><p>It  lifted an arm, pointed a bony finger toward Hiro. -YOU!- Hiro heard  in his mind. -YOU DID THIS TO ME!-</p><p>Also  in his mind, Hoko started screaming.</p><p>Hiro  himself only stood in shock.</p><p>-FIX  ME, YOU BASTARD! PUT ME BACK THE WAY I WAS!- the corpse was slowly  getting to its feet.</p><p>-<i>Why  the hell aren't you running?</i>- Hoko demanded, -<i>That zombie is  gonna kill us!-</i></p><p>Hiro  was beginning to put the pieces together. The man he punched  out-no, not a man, a quivering mass of sewer sludge masquerading as  one, a boil on the ass of the lowliest devil in seven hells fashioned  somehow into the basic shape of humanity, the rapist and murderer of  fourteen teenaged girls who had gotten off scott free- this <i>thing</i>  was what now staggered before him, shorn of its flesh as if no longer  capable of pulling off a full disguise. "THIS, is your brother?"  Hiro's tone was deeply accusatory. Even through the higher pitch of  Hoko's vocal chords the words seemed cloaked in ominous darkness.</p><p>"Yes,  I'm afraid so. This corpse, which until recently had the good sense  to remain still," Inamura raised his hand in a "stop"  gesture which seemed to cause the zombie to flinch in apprehension,  "Was once my elder brother, Inamura Yusuke. When we were kids he  used to give me piggy back rides. He used to walk with me to school.  I used to look up to him. I'm afraid though, that he stopped being my  elder brother long before he died. And he died long before you killed  him."</p><p>-<i>What  is he talking about?</i>- Hoko was asking in his brain.</p><p>Hiro  paid no attention. "That wasn't his name. It was-"</p><p>"Changed  after the first rape charge. My father disowned him and I swore to  make it my life's work to put scum like him behind bars."</p><p>-DAD  NEVER GAVE ME ANYTHING! NONE OF YOU EVER GAVE ME ANYTHING!- the thing  screamed at Inamura, but Inamura didn't seem to hear as he took a  casual pull off his cigarette.</p><p>"Thirty-five  years I spent chasing after my brother and his kind, and then one day  his decomposing corpse comes sauntering into the precinct like the  prodigal son returned. I think he even expected a fatted calf."</p><p>"Fatted  calf?" Hiro didn't catch the connotation. He shook his head,  "How did he wind up here? Why is he still alive?"</p><p>"The  answer to both questions, my friend, is that this," Inamura  gestured with the hand that held his cigarette to indicate his  surroundings, "is Nerima."</p><p>"Yeah,  okay, I know weird stuff happens around here for some reason, but he  lived on the other side of Tokyo. What is he doing here?"</p><p>"Trying  to stay alive. Like all magical beings he needs a source of energy.  Nerima is one such source. There are others. I'd bet the place Ranma  and his friends got their curses is another example. Usually a source  is one or more of three things. Either its an opening in the ground,  such as a spring or volcano, a site of extreme evil, or of extreme  tectonic pressure."</p><p>"Tectonic  pressure… Right." Hiro was a little lost.</p><p>"Tokyo  is only a short distance from an intersection of three tectonic  plates, a prime location for sources."</p><p>-EXCUSE  ME, BUT I'M STILL HERE, HELLO?-</p><p>"Hey,  guess what, asshole, I don't care," Kawagami spat out at the  undead rapist.</p><p>"That's  uncalled for," Inamura pointed angrily, "Just because I  like to be dramatic and mysterious about things when I explain them  doesn't make me a…" He straightened. "Oh. You were  talking to my brother."</p><p>"Yeah.  I guess you can't hear him then?"</p><p>"Only  in my dreams. I'd like you to tell him something before you kill him.  Or maybe he can understand me already. I can't tell. I'd like you to  tell him that I still miss him, and I always will. Just as I'll  always love that part of him that was kind to me all those years ago.  He deserves every pain he has received and more for what he did. But  with luck perhaps he'll get his shit together in the next life and we  can be brothers again sometime down the road. He's already wasted  this life."</p><p>-YOU  ALWAYS WERE WEAK, LITTLE BROTHER.-</p><p>"You  know that part about him getting his shit together in another life?"  Hiro said.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Not  likely." Hiro looked over the undead elephant sphincter,  grimacing at how he had to look up at the murderer now. "How am  I supposed to kill him?"</p><p>"Just  stop keeping him alive," Inamura answered.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Until  you have better control of your powers, they are more or less  attached to your subconscious. You hate my brother for what he did,  what he almost got away with. But Hate is an attractive emotion, like  Love. You don't really want him dead any more than I do. So your  curse was incomplete. It only half killed him. You want to see him  suffer, you want to defeat him somehow, so you've unconsciously been  keeping him alive. But there's no way you can make him suffer enough  for it to matter, no way to conquer his wretchedness to make him see  the horror of what he has done. You have to let go. Just as I have  had to let go."</p><p>-YEAH  JUST GIVE UP, PANSY ASS. YOU GOT A LUCKY SHOT WITH THAT PUNCH. YOU'D  NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT AGAIN. YOU DESERVE THAT BODY YOU'RE IN NOW.  HEH I CAN JUST FEEL THAT VIRGIN PUSSY SLIDING OVER MY COCK. MMM MMM  MMM!-</p><p>Hiro  fought the rush of anger that washed over him, his fists clenched and  tight against his sides. He could feel all too well the differences  between this body and his usual one. Even without Inamura's advice,  he knew that he could not allow himself to be goaded. With a shaking,  disturbingly feminine sounding voice, Hiro asked, "How did he  get this way? You say he was a good person once? How is that  possible?"</p><p>Inamura  took in some smoke from his cigarette and let it out in a drawn out  sigh. "I've seen it happen to other people. It's different every  time, but in all cases there's a point where in order to survive, or  to get something they feel they need, the person has to sacrifice  something precious to them. Sometimes they can get it back.  Sometimes," Inamura nodded at his brother, "It's lost  forever."</p><p>"What  is it?" Hiro asked, "What do they sacrifice?"</p><p>"Again  it takes a different form for every person, but if you ask me, what  it amounts to is…humanity."</p><p>Hiro  looked again at the zombie he had unwittingly made with a blow from  his fist. Inamura said his brother died long before Hiro ever met  him. Maybe that was just a rationalization. But it felt good. It made  sense. Thinking that a human being could be capable of doing what he  had done…that was just too difficult to fathom.</p><p>There  was nothing Hiro could do to restore the zombie's humanity. That very  thought caused the wretched undead thing to fall apart where it stood  into a loose pile of rotten flesh and dry bones.</p><p>Inside  his mind, Hoko seemed to breathe a sigh of relief and relax a little.</p><p>Hiro  felt the opposite. He was starting to get the willies. When he first  moved to Nerima, he thought that the craziness was kind of quaint.  Now though, stuck in the body of a seventeen-year-old girl and having  just disintegrated a zombie he had unwittingly created, he found he  was neck deep in the craziness, and "quaint" was NOT the  word to describe it.</p><p>-alley-</p><p>Copycat  would never have been able to break out of his struggle with the  nekoken if it hadn't been for the terrible pain he felt as Ranma's ki  claws sliced through his arm and torso. Ranma's claws were almost  three feet long, at least ten times longer than his own had been.  Clothing, skin, muscle, bone, the claws zipped through them all in an  instant as if they were nothing but a cloud of smoke. The claws  entered at Copycat's left shoulder and exited out his right lower  torso, leaving Copycat on his back, separated from his left arm and  his legs. He only had just enough time to use the blanket with his  right arm before Ranma came after him again.</p><p>Healed  in an instant from the blanket, Copycat still only barely dodged  Ranma's next attack. Another one came right after it and then  another. Needing more space to maneuver, Copycat jumped, as Ranma had  earlier, first to the wall of the undamaged building and then to the  roof of the one whose fire escape Ranma had destroyed.</p><p>Ranma  was there a fraction of a second later.</p><p>All  Copycat could do was dodge blow after blow. His body fell into an odd  sort of autopilot as he tried to figure some way out of the  situation. The extra space he had afforded from jumping to the roof  was rapidly diminishing as Ranma drove him toward the roof of the  next building. He tried to jump, but lost his legs again in the  attempt. He landed hard on the severed end of his spinal chord which  shattered on impact and forced him to cry out even as he managed to  use the blanket again.</p><p>When  he had found out he could hurt himself and heal instantly with the  blanket he had become an avid masochist. At first he hurt himself out  of a sort of training regimen so that he would be able to continue to  fight while injured. Soon though, he began to enjoy it. Each slice of  blade or searing of flesh connected him with the world, allowed him  to feel something other than the emptiness of being alone. Of not  having an identity.</p><p>Even  before that previous fight with Ranma he had felt apart from society.  An orphan without even foster parents or school to give him some  semblance of a normal life, all he could do was go from town to town  copying martial arts techniques and challenging the masters. Fighting  was the only thing that gave him purpose. A purpose that Ranma had  taken away, simply by being better.</p><p>How  do you defeat someone whose abilities go beyond skill? How do you  train for a battle you are sure to fail…when you've never really  trained before…when you have no teacher to guide you? Copycat  attacked himself, learned not to feel pity or pain, dove into the  darkness of his soul.</p><p>Still,  even this sacrifice had not prepared him for this battle. Ranma was  relentless, inhuman with human intelligence. A force of nature  without nature's equanimity. Copycat dodged, healed injuries as fast  of possible and tried in vain to find an opening, but it was no use.  He was starting to get tired.</p><p>The  power of the blanket was not infinite, it could only pull so much  mass from nullspace before it needed replenishing. Copycat's various  severed limbs were turning into a thick smoke and being sucked back  into nullspace, but the process was slow, and Ranma was very very  fast.</p><p>Operating  on pure instinct, Copycat jumped away from where he was standing as  Ranma's claws gouged deep crevasses into the roof with a sound that  scraped across Copycat's back molars like an electric sander. The  resistance from the roof made Ranma slow long enough for Copycat to  see her face. She was smiling widely, completely relaxed, enjoying  herself. A kitten, playing with a wounded bird.</p><p>The  nekoken wasn't a mere technique. Of that Copycat was certain. Trying  to control it was like trying to tame a tiger by letting it consume  your flesh. Even the small amount of time Copycat let it out was  agonizing. The thing was like a demon, or at best, a parasite. And  yet Ranma seemed merged with it now. She moved not only with the  movements of a cat, but with the precision of all her martial arts  training. Her eyes burned not only with feral hunger, but with cold  intelligence. Even her grin, wider and more menacing though it was,  was eerily similar to Ranma's usual smirk.</p><p>Copycat  realized in that precious moment as Ranma dragged her claws out of  the roof, that he was actually afraid.</p><p>He  could not run away. Ranma was too fast. He could not try to counter  attack. Ranma would rip him to shreds. Thinking fast, he used the  blanket to turn into the Kawagami body, pulled out the pistol from  its holster, and started firing rounds at the red-headed demon  creature. He emptied an entire magazine, but not one of the bullets  found their mark, and in the end, the only thing Copycat managed to  accomplish was to make himself a steady target for Ranma's claws.</p><p>This  time, there was no escape. Copycat didn't even see the attack. He  just felt searing pain in his shoulders and then both his arms fell  to the ground with a thud. Warm blood gushed down his sides through  the fabric of his uniform shirt. Another swipe from out of nowhere  took his legs from him and he was on his back, writhing in agony and  no longer capable of doing anything about it.</p><p>"It's  not supposed to be like this!" Copycat cried. The pain washed  over him in waves with every beat of his heart, his life's blood  pooling onto the ground around him. The sensation that connected him  to the world now betraying him, taking him further away from it. He  had thought he would never be this weak again. He had accepted the  oni's gift of the blanket and camera at the orphanage. He had found  out the secret of the two items. He had escaped. He had copied every  technique he could for years. He had learned to welcome pain. He was  stronger now, ruthless. He didn't have to be helpless. Not again.</p><p>Ranma  stood over him. Standing like a human, but somehow the cat was still  there in her expression. She went out of his frame of vision for a  moment as she bent down to pick something up. Then she was there  again, framed by the electric blue of the darkening sky, and holding  a pistol pointed straight at his skull. Glancing at it she bent down  again, this time getting something from Copycat's waist. A spare  magazine. She clicked it into the pistol and aimed again.</p><p>None  of it seemed to matter. It had all been for nothing. There would be  no third chance at this. He had lost, and whether Ranma shot him or  he bled to death from his wounds, he would die shortly. "It  isn't fair!" Copycat yelled, crazily, "I've learned more,  seen more, done more…Why am I-?"</p><p>But  his words were cut off by the retort from the pistol in Ranma's  hand- that and the bullet that coursed through his cerebral cortex,  subsequently exploding out of his occipital lobe and embedding itself  a full two centimeters into the concrete of the roof below.</p><p>The  words he was about to say were "still" and "empty."</p><p>-alley-</p><p>Nabiki  hated having to stay down on the street while Ranko fought on the  roof. After eating the apple, he felt a little groggy but otherwise  fine. While this was odd, considering the fact that only ten minutes  ago he was dying of a bullet wound to the chest, it didn't change the  fact that now he was fine and perfectly capable of climbing another  building's fire escape to see what's going on. But if he did that,  sure he might be able to see how the fight was going, but he was also  just as likely to get another bullet wound, or worse, get caught in  one of those new Tobu Sennuki things of Ranko's.</p><p>All  he could do was listen to the sounds of battle overhead and wonder.</p><p>Ranma's  residual male ego had gotten to him more than he would have thought.  The complete stupidity he had exhibited in following the killer… It  made so much sense at the time. Heck, even now he halfway wanted to  get on the roof to "protect" Ranko, even though he knew  he'd just get in her way. The other half of him just wanted to watch.</p><p>She  had always enjoyed watching Ranma fight, even when she thought of him  as just a freeloader.</p><p>Nabiki  looked quizzically down at her breasts, which had suddenly been  restored to her. <i>Oh,</i> she realized, <i>I was lusting after male  Ranma. Too much for the male side to cope with I guess. </i></p><p>As  grateful as she was for her return to femininity, she couldn't quite  shake the ominous feeling that she was out of her depth. She usually  would have worked out some angle on this by now, figured out a way to  come out on top. She wasn't even sure what "on top" would  mean now. Being able to change into a man might help out in some of  her business dealings, but how could she maintain her public image?  Did she even have a public image anymore? Her televised urban  ailurophilic sexcapade with Ranma had to have shattered any standing  Nabiki had. It was at least a nasty mark on her escutcheon. Did she  care? She was supposed to control things from afar, be the axis upon  which the craziness of Furinkan High School turned. Why the hell did  she have to go and fall in love with Ranma Saotome?</p><p>It  was Ranko Saotome now though. Ranko was 100 girl now, and Nabiki was  still in love with her. On top of everything, she was now technically  a lesbian.</p><p>Nabiki  let out a small explosive chuckle.</p><p>It  would be okay. Sure she could get upset about it, bemoan the loss of  her "reputation", but really what sort of a reputation was  being an "Ice Queen" anyway? It was really not any  different from when people would try to blackmail her. Like that one  time, someone tried to get out of a debt by threatening to spread  pictures of Nabiki in her underwear. Nabiki simply smiled and said  the debt now had an added charge for perversion. The next day, she  started selling her own pictures. She found it kind of fun actually.  The domination poses she did with the black leotard and whip were  particularly popular, though they led to some unfortunate comparisons  to Kodachi Kuno later on.</p><p>All  she had to do was accept her situation, and then she could manipulate  it to her advantage.</p><p>Nabiki  closed her eyes and breathed. Okay. She was now an epistemotransexual  in love with a former aquatransexual martial artist who was  borderline psychotic, which is what attracted her to…her in the  first place. She had saved her fiancé(e) from a sadistic  geriatric manipulator of liquid metal from an alternate universe  almost directly after learning her best friend had been murdered by a  doppelganger. She could see auras now, due to having had a near-death  experience, and could now apparently start the engines of motorcycles  with her mind. Furthermore, she now had an alternate personality that  was a cat, and while in that personality she had had unprotected sex  in the middle of a city intersection.</p><p>Nabiki's  eyes popped open "Oh gods, what if I'm pregnant?"</p><p>The  sounds of several gunshots above her reminded her that that was the  least of her concerns at the moment. The accepting thing was going to  take some time, though. That was for sure.</p><p>The  fight above her seemed to quiet down, and Nabiki watched the small,  dark blue patch of twilight sky between the buildings for some clue  as to what was going on. There was another last gunshot, which sent  chills down Nabiki's back, and then…</p><p>And  then, something appeared in the patch of open sky that Nabiki had not  expected.</p><p>-roof-</p><p>Ranko  stood over the monster's body, pistol still aimed at its forehead,  watching. Her thoughts hadn't come around to forming complete  sentences yet. She knew though, on some level apart from coherent  thought, that she could not trust appearances. She had to be sure it  was dead.</p><p>For  a while everything was still. Only Ranko's breathing and the sounds  of the city around her prevented her from feeling that somehow time  had stopped and she would be stuck in this position for eternity.  During the fight, everything had been easy. Fun, even. Only now in  the stillness, did she begin to feel a twinge of panic…a vague  feeling of something pressing in around her with increasing force.</p><p>Fading  into view, like a picture on Polaroid film, so gradually she almost  missed them, a camera and a blanket appeared next to the monster's  torso. The camera was old and blocky, but of good quality. The lens  had the words "made in japan" written around it in white,  English characters. Fairly normal, but there seemed something off  about it. Ranko felt a memory struggle to rise to the surface of the  murky waters of her mind, but she couldn't quite retrieve it. She was  too distracted by everything she was struggling to ignore. The  blanket was folded underneath the camera in a square, but something  about the way it appeared made it seem somehow like the coiled body  of a snake.</p><p>Then  the camera and blanket moved.</p><p>One  second the camera was on the middle of the dark green, folded  blanket. The next it was floating half a meter in the air, the  blanket hanging from its base.</p><p>Startled,  Ranko shot squeezed the trigger of the pistol, hitting a corner of  the camera. A shrieking sound seemed to issue from its lens.</p><p>It  wasn't a lens.</p><p>The  camera morphed and distorted until it was a circular mouth with  serrated teeth all along its edge, attached to what was once the  blanket. The blanket, too, changed, unfolding, straightening,  thickening, and growing more pale until it was a greenish white,  chitonous, square section of a much larger creature. Another section  like this one followed as the thing that had been masquerading as a  camera seemed to shoot out of a hole in the doppelganger's side. In  only seconds, five more sections, each about half a meter long came  out of null space. The creature was already towering over Ranma and  it was still growing.</p><p>Ranko  shot at it again, but the bullet had no effect as the thing continued  to fly out of null space. Extending her ki claws from her left hand,  Ranko swiped at the thing just as the last sections left the  dimensional hole they were coming from. The chiton was denser than  bone, but Ranko's swipe still reduced the last three sections to  ribbons. As the remains fell to the ground, they crumbled and turned  into a blue mist that was quickly sucked away in three directions…</p><p>-alley-</p><p>Nabiki  was busy trying to make sense of the creature that rose up into the  sky from the roof, when the blue mist came after her. It was blue…but  at the same time it was bright green and flashing like a strobe. She  felt it pulling her toward it even as it homed in and darted toward  her breast.</p><p>The  mist diffused into her, became part of her, but somehow it felt like  it had always been a part of her, only it had gone missing without  her knowing. Pieces of her psyche that had been missing ever since  her accident yesterday now woke up all at once, demanding to know how  the hell she had managed to screw things up so badly.</p><p>And  then, as if getting a fragment of her former self slammed into her  wasn't enough torment, she started remembering things she had never  done.</p><p>She  remembered killing Hoko. Cutting her body into pieces and  distributing them in dumpsters all around Tokyo. She remembered  killing her best friend. As if it had been her all along and not some  nameless monster. No it wasn't quite her. Someone was wearing her  like a costume, using her like a puppet. <i>Copycat Ken</i>. The name  came to her as her insides screamed it into her heart. She watched  the life drain from her friend's eyes, felt her pulse weaken and die.  Worst of all, she felt some part of her, the same ugly, creeping part  of her that had one time almost shot her sister, that grew out of her  soul like a tumor, threatening to consume her, she felt this part of  her laugh in delight.</p><p>Some  time during all this, Nabiki collapsed to the pavement. She screamed,  thrashed her head around, tore at the concrete around her trying to  get away from the memories, but they wouldn't leave. They were  already a part of her.</p><p>-morgue-</p><p>Hiro  had no idea what it was when he saw it. He was helping Inamura clean  up his brother's remains. Hoko kept asking him to stop looking at  them as it grossed her out but she couldn't control her eyes. And  then, as Hiro tried to sweep the remains into a dust bin while  looking at the cinder block wall in front of him, he saw the blue  mist come through. There were two clouds of it that appeared. They  both seemed to hesitate upon entering the room for half a second.  Then they both zoomed toward Hiro's heart.</p><p>In  an instant, Hiro was in his own body. In uniform even, but he didn't  notice. He was remembering how he tied himself up. How he looked at  Hoko's body when they were about to leave for the police department.  How he shot Nabiki. How he tried to shoot Ranma. All these things  came at once, and were disturbing enough in their own right, but what  Hiro felt more acutely in that moment were all the memories of pain.  Of being shot in the chest, of having his torso severed five or six  times. Of falling on his severed spinal chord from a height of just  under a meter and a half. Of getting shot in the head while bleeding  from the stumps of all his major appendages. Of dying.</p><p>This  was all more than a human being could possibly take. Hiro passed out.</p><p>-hoko-</p><p>For  her part, Hoko already knew the perversions Copycat had committed  with her body. While it wasn't pleasant to be reminded of them, it  was bearable. She was mostly relieved when she found she was able to  move on her own. Relief grew to outright joy when she realized she  was alive again. Really and truly alive. She felt some concern for  Hiro when he fell over, but even as she caught him to keep him from  hitting his head on the hard tile floor, she was smiling. Just to  prove that she could she spoke "I'm alive!"</p><p>Inamura  was the only other conscious person in the room, so Hoko turned to  him and repeated it, tears coming out of her eyes. "I'm alive!"</p><p>Inamura  had a wide smile on his face. He looked completely goofy, just like  when he'd do his lame magic tricks whenever she and Nabiki stayed  over at Ami's house. "Is it really you, Hoko-chan?"</p><p>"As  far as I know, I mean, I can't be the real thing, I saw that bastard  kill the real thing. I'm just a copy, but I feel like me. I thought  I'd never be able to talk again or move on my own. Oh Uncle Inamura,  I'm ALIVE!" Even though it was kind of weird, Hoko hugged  Inamura. He smelled like cigarettes. He felt warm. Her tears were  seeping into the rough fabric of his suit jacket as she squeezed his  thin, wiry frame as hard as she could.</p><p>"Welcome  back, Hoko-chan. I thought we'd lost you." Inamura laughed in  the way he always did when he was about to tell a bad and vaguely  disturbing joke. "You're much better preserved than that other  zombie."</p><p>-alley-</p><p>Nabiki  took some long, deep, shuddering breaths. She had heard terrible  stories during her years as Furinkan High's number one source of  information, stories that were like slow acting viruses, spread  through whispers behind raised hands. Girls did get raped at  Furinkan. Nabiki knew she was one of the lucky ones. It hadn't  happened to her and as much as she flirted with the boys, especially  before Ranma arrived, it very well could have. Right now, though, she  couldn't help feeling that maybe she had a good idea of what it was  like.</p><p>Copycat  Ken hadn't just made her kill her best friend. He made her <i>enjoy  </i>it. As many times as she told herself that it wasn't her, her  memories, which supplied her with excruciating detail, kept telling  her it was. She felt like she could have stopped it if she had only  tried hard enough to break through Copycat's control, but she  couldn't have done anything. She hadn't even thought of struggling.  Even her thoughts had been under Copycat's command. But they were so  close to her thoughts, his control was so subtle…It wasn't her  fault, but every time she told herself that, it felt like a lie.</p><p>It  was the feeling of moisture in her eyes that snapped her out of it.  Tears never solved anything. She couldn't lay on the pavement feeling  sorry for herself now. He had to be there for Ranko.</p><p>Sitting  up, Nabiki blinked at his sex change. He had just gotten his boobs  back. Why was he male again? Was it Ranko? That was part of it, he  realized, but also there was the strong emotions, which he simply  couldn't deal with right now. Yet, Nabiki had always felt girls were  better at dealing with emotions then boys, it was one of the reasons  why boys could be manipulated so easily. So why the sex change? <i>Girls  </i>ARE<i> better at dealing with emotions,</i> Nabiki reaffirmed. He  sighed, <i>Boys, however, are much better at </i>NOT<i> dealing with  them.</i></p><p>Right  now, the horrible nature of his recently gained memories was in a  sort of translucent box that he would have to open up later, but that  he could almost forget about now, even though he could see what was  inside struggling to get out. It was still there but now he felt he  could ignore it.</p><p>He  had to be careful, Nabiki cautioned himself. This lack of estrogen  was fast becoming a crutch. The brave thing would be to change back  to female, confront the memories and find some way to accept them.</p><p>Nabiki  got up. He was a coward. He felt a pang of guilt, and quickly as he  could, he relegated that too to a box in a corner of his mind. He  would deal with these things later. Right now he had to find Ranko.</p><p>As  if called by his thoughts, Ranko fell from the roof onto her feet  like…well…a cat. "It's over," she said. All Nabiki  could see was the top of her lowered head, "He's dead. I killed  him."</p><p>"Are  you okay?" Nabiki asked, stepping closer. Ranma's aura looked  strange, almost alien, deep blues and dark reds mixing to form  roiling purples. The purple was similar in hue to Inamura's aura, but  there was no steadiness to it. Only…chaos.</p><p>"There  was something controlling him I think," Ranko continued almost  seeming to ignore Nabiki, "A demon. Looked like a… I'm not  even sure what it looked like. I tried to kill it, but it got away."</p><p>"It  doesn't matter, Ranko. At least you got the bastard, right?"</p><p>"It  was Copycat Ken, Fly. He was at least a year younger than me."  Ranko still wouldn't look up. Her aura however seemed to be doing  back flips.</p><p>"He  killed my best friend, Ran. He could be six years old and I'd still  want his head on a stick."</p><p>Now  Ranko looked up. "You don't get it! He was under that demon's  control the whole time! He probably didn't even know it was there! He  didn't kill those people, that fucking demon did! He was just a kid,  and I killed him and set that demon free to torture more innocent  people."</p><p>Nabiki's  eyes widened as he saw Ranko's ki claws extend and retract with the  surge of emotion. Her eyes glowed a dull purple, like the eye shine  of a nocturnal beast. Ranko had somehow merged with the nekoken.  Nabiki felt himself oddly aroused. He shook his head free of the  thought. He had to calm Ranko down. "You couldn't have known  that would happen." He tried to embrace her but she recoiled.</p><p>"Don't  touch me!" She yelled. "You'll feel what I feel."</p><p>"You  can't go through this alone, Ran." Nabiki said.</p><p>"There's  nothing to go through anymore, Fly. It's over. I'm not a martial  artist. I don't think I'm even human anymore. We can't be together.  I'm a murderer, you understand? I killed someone. Yes, he killed your  best friend and Gosunkugi and two other people that we know of, but  he didn't have a choice. I did."</p><p>Nabiki  lunged forward and locked both his arms around Ranko. Ranko moved  violently and was seconds away from breaking Nabiki's grip, but then  she relaxed, melting into Nabiki's chest in a burst of tears. She  felt so cold…</p><p>Nabiki  had Ranma's memories then. They had gone through another similar  experience. They had both killed an innocent person. Somehow it was  better now. Somehow despite it all, Ranko crying into his chest felt  right to Nabiki. It was okay for her to cry, because she was a girl.  It was okay for him not to cry, because he was a boy. And there was  something wrong with that rationale, but Nabiki just put it in  another box and hid it away for later.</p><p>"Firefly?"  Ranko looked up at Nabiki. Her aura had calmed into a pastel blue  violet. It seemed soft now, like a cloud.</p><p>"Yes,  Ran-chan?"</p><p>"I  don't think I want to be a boy again, at least not for a while. Is  that okay?"</p><p>Nabiki  didn't know what to say so he just nodded and patted Ranko on the  arm.</p><p>"Ow!"  Ranko exclaimed, startling Nabiki.</p><p>"What  is it?"</p><p>"It's  nothing. Just a bruise." Ranko said and hugged Nabiki tighter.</p><p>They  stood like that for awhile before Ranko spoke again. "I love  you, Nabiki," she said, "It sounds weird to say it, but  it's true. I'd do anything for you."</p><p>"I  love you too, Ranko." Nabiki said, filled with an emotion far  too big for any box.</p><p>"It's  scary though." Ranma backed away a little, her arms loosely  hanging from Nabiki's neck.</p><p>"Why?"  Nabiki asked.</p><p>"If  someone hurts you again…I don't care who they are…I am going to  kill them."</p><p>-AUTHOR'S  NOTE-</p><p>Once  again, I assure you Ranma will eventually be male again. It's just  that he has to go deep into his feminine side for a while, much like  how Dante has to go to the very bottom of Hell, climbing down toward  Satan's nether regions, before emerging in Purgatory and then if he  doesn't see his dead girlfriend Beatrice, he climbs back up/down into  Hell and there are six more weeks of winter.</p><p>Perhaps  next chapter will actually involve Nodoka, whom I've been really  meaning to make a central character.</p><p>Also  next chapter will have an awful lot of Sayuri in it. Why? Because she  strikes me as being rather dull. We simply can't have that can we:snickers evilly:</p><p>Currently  my writing speed is about a chapter a year. Thanks for being patient  and for all your comments and hope you continue to enjoy.</p><p>It  get's weirder.</p><p>-Zorknot</p>
