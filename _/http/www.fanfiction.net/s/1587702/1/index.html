</div>Tatewaki Kuno looked at the assorted artifacts of the store with disdain. He had<br/>come to this lowly establishment in search of a way to free the tigress Akane<br/>Tendo and the pigtailed girl. If the sorcerer Saotome was holding his two loves<br/>captive with foul magic it would stand to reason there would be a magic artifact<br/>that could break that spell. A pair of silver necklaces in a display case caught his<br/>attention. He walked over to get a better look at them. They looked like two<br/>ordinary necklaces made out of fine silver shackles. When he looked closer<br/>though, he could see them emitting a faint glow of otherworldly light.<p>"Hmmmm. I see you are admiring the two necklaces of Seikatsu." A voice came<br/>from behind the delusional kendoist.<p>When Tatewaki Kuno turned around he noticed the store clerk standing there<br/>polishing his glasses. The clerk was an elderly man with a large white mustache<br/>and wearing a brown gi.<p>"And what is so special about the necklaces of Seikatsu, I do pray tell?" Tatewaki<br/>said in a commanding voice.<p>The store clerk put on an all-knowing face. "The necklaces of Seikatsu are<br/>rumored to have the power to change the wearers lives forever. Their incredible<br/>power will shape a destiny no one knows."<p>Tatewaki contemplated this. "In other words, you don't know what they do."<p>"You are correct." The store clerk responded.<p>"Very well, then." The kendoist stood upright. "I will by them!"<p>The store clerk made some warding gestures. "Oh, no, sir. I can't do that! Those<br/>necklaces are much too dangerous to sell. I won't sell them. Not even if you<br/>slapped me in the face with a wad of bills."<p>Tatewaki promptly pulled a wad of bills from his pocked and with it, slapped the<br/>store clerk in the face.<p>"Sold!" The store clerk shouted.<p>* * *<p>Title: Binding changes<br/>Author: Poly<p>A fan fiction based on Takahashi Rumiko's Manga series, Ranma 1/2. The<br/>characters of Ranma 1/2 are the property of Takahashi Rumiko and her<br/>licensees.<p>PART I<br/>Time for a change<p>* * *<p>Akane walked briskly along the road towards Furinkan high. "That jerk!" She<br/>thought angrily. Ranma just had to go ahead and insult her again. In response<br/>she had kicked the fence Ranma was walking on and he had fallen in the canal<br/>with a loud splash. Now she approached the gates of Furinkan without Ranma<br/>running alongside her. "The idiot is probably hunting for some hot water by now."<br/>She thought. She clenched her fists. "Stop thinking about him." She admonished<br/>herself.<p>With a scowl on her face she entered the school grounds. She was so caught up<br/>in her anger, that it came as a total surprise when two arms suddenly embraced<br/>her from behind. She heard the unwelcome voice of the last person on earth she<br/>wanted to deal with right now.<p>"My fearsome tigress! How wonderful it is to see you this beautiful morning. Let<br/>me embrace you with my love!"<p>Akane was about to pound Kuno into pasta when she suddenly felt something<br/>clicking around her neck. Her eyes went wide when she noticed Kuno had placed<br/>a necklace around her neck. She shoved the kendoist aside and grabbed the<br/>necklace, and then tried to get it off. After a few tries she turned towards Kuno<br/>with a growl.<p>"What is this thing? Get it off!" She demanded.<p>Kuno was still lost in his own fantasy world though. And his actions proved it.<br/>"Come to me, my tigress!" He opened his arms in an attempt to embrace Akane<br/>again. "Rush into my arms so that you may show your appreciation for this fine<br/>gift."<p>The kendoist ignored the angry battle aura flaring around his target. "Kuno! You<br/>jerk!" Akane gave him a mighty uppercut, sending the idiot in an arch over the<br/>school building. The angry short-haired girl walked inside the building while still<br/>tugging at the necklace.<p>A couple of minutes later, Ranma came dashing down the school grounds after<br/>having hunted down some hot water to change back. He made it just in time for<br/>class before the last bell had rung. Morning classes were boring for the pigtailed<br/>martial artist, although he did notice Akane was more irritated than usual. She<br/>kept tugging at a the silver necklace she was wearing. "When did she get that?"<br/>He thought with a bit of jealously. He would never admit that though. Nope. No<br/>way was he jealous if someone was giving his fiancée jewelry. Ranma kept<br/>repeating that as a mantra, although it was plainly visible on his face that he was<br/>jealous.<p>When lunch hour approached, Akane was still simmering and Ranma was<br/>seriously thinking about hurting someone bad.<p>"Aaaaaargh!" Akane exclaimed when the teacher had finally left their home room<br/>for lunch, who was followed by the rest of Ranma and Akane's classmates. "I<br/>can't take this stupid thing anymore!" She started pulling on the necklace again,<br/>still with little no success. "This is all Kuno's fault!" She growled.<p>"Kuno!" Ranma exclaimed. "What has he done now?" He asked angrily.<p>"It's this stupid necklace." Akane said pointing at it. "Kuno put it on me this<br/>morning, and now I can't seem to get it off!"<p>Frowning, Ranma moved over to Akane, who was still sitting at her desk. "Let me<br/>try." He said.<p>With a frustrated sigh, Akane put her hands down to allow Ranma a try. The<br/>pigtailed martial artist tried with all his strength but it was of no use. The necklace<br/>just wouldn't budge. "Stupid chain." Ranma mumbled. Akane just let him try, a<br/>warm feeling was starting to spread through her body while Ranma's hands<br/>brushed her neck occasionally.<p>Whit a growl of frustration, he gave up. "Let's get out of here. I'm hungry." Ranma<br/>finally said. "I'm going to find Kuno and pound some answers out of him. No way<br/>is that a normal necklace." Akane just sighed. A bit disappointed, although she<br/>would never admit that.<p>The both of them grabbed their lunches and exitted the classroom. Once outside,<br/>Ranma immediately stormed of in search of Kuno. Akane just rolled her eyes end<br/>joined her friends, Yuka and Sayuri, for lunch.<p>"Did you two have a fight again?" Sayuri asked Akane with a speculating glance.<p>Akane just shrugged noncommittally. "It's not that." she said whit an exasperated<br/>tone. "It's this stupid necklace!" Akane started to tug at the offending piece of<br/>jewelry.<p>Both Yuka and Sayuri were confused. "What's wrong with that necklace?" Yuka<br/>asked. "Sure, it's a little plain, but it's a nice necklace. Did Ranma give it to you?"<br/>She inquired excitedly.<p>"I wish." Akane thought and firmly suppressed the direction her mind was<br/>wandering. Akane just growled in frustration. "It's not that. The stupid thing won't<br/>come off! This is all Kuno's fault!" She ended, irritated. At that moment the three<br/>girls heard commotion coming from the other side of the school yard and<br/>seconds later Kuno came sailing through the air making nice time gaining lower<br/>earth orbit.<p>Akane noticed a fuming Ranma stomping inside the school building. Slightly<br/>worried she stood up while motioning her friends to stay, and followed Ranma<br/>inside. It didn't take her long to find the pigtailed martial artist. She stopped dead<br/>in her tracks when she noticed Ranma was furiously pulling at a silver necklace<br/>similar to the one she was currently wearing around her neck.<p>"How has this happened?" She exclaimed.<p>Ranma looked up with a scowl on his face. "Kuno had another one of those<br/>things. I was examining it after I knocked the idiot down. He didn't stay down<br/>though. He shocked me half to death with this thing when he graphed grabbed it<br/>to pull himself up. Now it's around my neck and the stupid thing won't come off<br/>either."<p>Akane just groaned. It was one of those messes Ranma got himself into, she<br/>supposed. She sighed in resignation. "Let's get back to class. We can figure out<br/>what to do after school." She grabbed Ranma's shirt and started dragging him<br/>off. She absentmindedly tugged at the necklace when it started to tingle slightly.<p>The tingling sensation didn't go away. When classes started again, Akane kept<br/>pulling at the necklace. The teacher started to notice and Ranma bent over<br/>towards Akane to warn her.<p>"Akane." He whispered. "I think you better stop pulling that necklace. The<br/>teacher is starting to notice." Unfortunately for Ranma, the teacher decided<br/>enough was enough.<p>"Ranma. Akane. Buckets. Hall. Now!"<p>With a resigned sigh, the both of them got the buckets and filled them with water.<br/>Once outside the classroom, they stared boredly into infinity.<p>Akane held her arm outstretched while holding the bucket of water and yawned.<br/>Ranma continued to look bored while holding a bucket of water in each hand.<p>"This is so boring." The pigtailed martial artist said. "I think the teach is going to<br/>make us stand in the hall the rest of the hour."<p>Akane just huffed. "What's the difference? You're just going to sleep in class<br/>anyway."<p>Ranma scowled at her. "It is the only place I can get some rest, you know." He<br/>said, agitated. "You just had to keep pulling on that necklace and getting us<br/>kicked out."<p>Akane's temper immediately flared. "You're saying this is my fault? You were the<br/>one talking in class!"<p>Ranma just grumbled faintly. Akane could here the faint "Uncute." though.<p>"Ranma. You jerk! Don't call me uncute!" With a swing she threw the content of<br/>her bucket in Ranma's direction. The pigtailed martial artist jumped back, but<br/>splashed the contents of his own buckets with the predictable result.<p>"What did you do that for!" Ranma-chan shouted, but her voice trailed off while<br/>she stared with bugged eyes at Akane. "Wha... wha... what happened to you?"<br/>She shrieked.<p>Akane was too preoccupied with the fact that her clothes suddenly didn't seem to<br/>fit right at all. Especially in the groin area where it was downright painful. Then it<br/>began to register in her mind that something was truly wrong. Slowly, her hand<br/>began to examine her chest. She froze when she concluded certain things were<br/>no longer there. Her hands slowly drifted downwards to the uncomfortable area.<br/>With another shock she concluded that there was something there that shouldn't<br/>be there at all. In slow motion, she pulled her hands back and looked at them.<br/>They were larger than they should be. Then she realized she was looking at his<br/>hands. Akane-kun's eyes glazed over and he plummetted to the ground in a dead<br/>faint.<p>Ranma-chan still stared with disbelieving eyes. "What the heck happened?" She<br/>mumbled to herself. This broke the trance she was in and she dashed forward to<br/>check if Akane-kun was aright. Noticing nothing amiss, except that Akane was<br/>now a boy and still unconscious, Ranma-chan started to wake him up.<p>Akane-kun groaned when his minded drifted back to the land of the living. He<br/>was still in a shocked state of mind. It all finally came back to her. She was<br/>somehow cursed with a man's body, and when he had found out he had fainted.<br/>Somehow this had to be Ranma's fault. When he saw the face of a certain<br/>redhead looking down on him, his first instinct was to grab the girl by her shirt<br/>and drag some answers out of her. Then he noticed the stormy, blue eyes filled<br/>with concern that looked into his own eyes of brown. His anger seemed to<br/>disappear.<p>Everything would have been alright if Ranma did not have to prove she still<br/>suffered from foot-in-the-mouth disease.<p>The redhead grinned down at Akane-kun. "Now you're a real tomboy, ne,<br/>Akane?"<p>"RANMA, YOU IDIOT!"<p>BLAM!<p>"Iteee...! That hurt, you know." Ranma-chan groaned from where her face was<br/>imbedded into the floor.<p>" Jerk!" Akane-kun huffed. "Can't you be serious for once? I've turned into a guy<br/>if you haven't noticed." Ranma-chan repressed the urge to say that was a definite<br/>improvement. Akane-kun looked at Ranma-chan as if he knew what she was<br/>thinking. "Anyway." He continued. "I want to know what happened. How did I get<br/>a Jusenkyo curse all of the sudden? I didn't even get wet."<p>Ranma-chan realized Akane-kun was right. The pigtailed girl repressed a snicker<br/>when she looked at the tall muscular guy dressed in a Furinkan high girls<br/>uniform. "Let's get some hot water and see if you change back." Ranma-chan<br/>said. Akane-kun nodded in agreement and the both of them snuck off to the<br/>nearest bathroom.<p>When they reached the end of the hall where the bathrooms were located,<br/>Akane-kun briskly walked into the girl's bathroom to get some hot water while<br/>Ranma-chan waited outside. A second later, Akane-kun rushed back outside<br/>from the girl's bathroom while rolls of toilet paper came flying after him and<br/>bouncing off his head when they hit. A girl's head appeared around the door and<br/>she screamed: "Pervert!"<p>Akana-kun panted slightly while leaning against the wall just around the corner<br/>and out of sight. Ranma-chan, who had witnessed the whole thing, snickered<br/>slightly. She grabbed Akane's arm and dragged him towards the boy's bathroom.<br/>"Come along, pervert. Let's get you changed back." She said with a grin. Akane-<br/>kun just looked bewildered.<p>Luckily for the both of them, the boy's bathroom was empty. Ranma-chan pushed<br/>the still somewhat out of it Akane-kun towards one of the sinks. "You change<br/>back while I keep on the lookout." Ranma-chan said. Akane-kun just nodded and<br/>turned on the warm water and waited for it to heat up.<p>After a couple of seconds, Akane-kun decided the water should be hot enough<br/>and splashed himself with the hot water. An unfamiliar tingle went throughout his<br/>body and, with some relief, she noticed she was back to her old self. She was<br/>startled when she heard the surprised exclamation from Ranma. When she<br/>turned around, she noticed Ranma standing there in his male form.<p>"How did this happen?" He exclaimed. "I didn't even touch the hot water!"<p>Akane got a funny suspicion and she fingered the necklace with narrowing eyes.<br/>"Change." She said.<p>"Huh?" Came the intelligent response from Ranma.<p>"Just splash yourself and change. I want to test something."<p>Ranma just shrugged and turned on the cold water, then stuck his hand under<br/>the faucet. The familiar change happened and soon Ranma was once again<br/>Ranma-chan. At the same time, Akane felt her body tingle once more, and all of<br/>a sudden the school uniform was way too tight again. Ranma-chan just looked<br/>with confusion at Akane-kun. "How come you changed too?"<p>Akane-kun just grimaced and walked to the sink again to get some hot water.<br/>One splash later and Akane was female again and Ranma was back to being<br/>male. Ranma was still confused. Akane just confirmed her suspicion. "I think it's<br/>those necklaces." She said. "I really need to pound Kuno now. I think whatever<br/>those necklaces are somehow linked your curse. Whenever one of us gets<br/>splashed with water, the both of us change."<p>Comprehension dawned in Ranma's eyes. "So when I got splashed from the<br/>water from the bucket, my curse activated as normal, but affected you too."<p>Akane just nodded. "I think we should talk to Cologne. She usually knows about<br/>these things. Let's just get back to class before the teacher misses us and we get<br/>into trouble."<p>Akane's remark proved true, because when they returned the teacher was<br/>waiting for them. Both of them were sent home with a letter for their parents<br/>about there delinquent behavior. They took it in stride. Ranma just ignored it,<br/>knowing that his father didn't care enough about schooling but would probably<br/>give him a lecture about it anyway. Akane just knew her father would just start<br/>wailing about his poor baby girl failing her education.<p>Both Akane and Ranma were halfway home when the inevitable happened. A<br/>couple of kids with super soaker two-thousands were running down the street<br/>shooting water at each other. Both Akane and Ranma were hit dead center dead<br/>on, of course. The kids ran away screaming about the weird guy in the dress.<br/>Ranma-chan just shook her head while Akane-kun looked uncomfortable<br/>because the dress was too tight.<p>Ranma-chan looked around and noticed that they were near the bridge over the<br/>canal. She grabbed Akane-kun's arm and dragged him under the bridge so that<br/>they wouldn't be seen. "Let's change clothes."<p>"Pervert!" Came the automatic response from Akane.<p>"Would you stop saying that!" Ranma-chan exclaimed. "Or do you want to walk<br/>all the way home as a guy wearing a dress?"<p>"Oh." Akane-kun said sheepishly. "Sorry. Just turn around while I'm changing."<br/>He said embarrassed. Ranma-chan just shrugged and turned around while<br/>removing her clothes. When she started to put on the school uniform Akane-kun<br/>handed her, she noticed some of the seams were torn because of the changes<br/>Akane had endured. Kasumi would probably be able to fix it though.<p>After getting dressed, they both turned around and looked at each other. Ranma-<br/>chan raised an eyebrow. "Not bad, Akane. A regular stud muffin." She said with a<br/>grin. Akane-kun just huffed and started walking off. Ranma-chan started to laugh<br/>when she noticed that Akane-kun was still walking like a girl. "What's so funny?"<br/>Akane-kun inquired while turning back towards Ranma-chan.<p>"You're walking like a girl while you are a guy." Ranma-chan said while<br/>snickering. "I think people will look at you really funny when you do that. Let me<br/>show you how it's done." Ranma-chan started to demonstrate how Akane-kun<br/>should walk.<p>"That's what I did." Akane-kun said in a flat voice.<p>Ranma-chan just shook her head. "No. You walked like this." The redhead<br/>promptly demonstrated. Akane-kun looked almost bug-eyed at the girl that was<br/>walking in front of him. "Ranma would have a lot of boy trouble if she kept<br/>walking like that." He thought to himself. "She doesn't even seem to notice how<br/>sexy it make's her look. Wait a minute. Did I just think 'sexy'! Don't go there,<br/>Akane. Bad thoughts. Bad."<p>"Hey, Akane. Why are you so red all of a sudden? Let's go home already."<p>The both of them climbed back from under the bridge and started on their way<br/>home again. Ranma-chan would occasionally correct Akane-kun on her walking<br/>style until she was satisfied. They were almost at the dojo when a familiar cry<br/>broke through the air.<p>"Airen!"<p>Glomp!<p>A bouncy purple-haired amazon had attached herself to Ranma-chan.<p>"Why airen in dress? You change and we go on date now, yes?"<p>Ranma-chan just struggled invain to get loose. "Let go, Shampoo. Can't breath!<br/>The school dress is just a disguise, okay?. And I'm not going on a date with you. I<br/>have to get home."<p>Akane-kun just simmered while watching the scene. He had half a mind to grab a<br/>bucket of water and throw it on the both of them. The only thing stopping him was<br/>the fact that Ranma was wearing his school uniform. Which he needed preserve<br/>for further use. "Let's go, Ranma." He said between clenched teeth. "We still<br/>have stuff to do, remember?"<p>Shampoo looked confused at the new boy. "Who you? You look like violent girl.<br/>No matter anyway. Have many deliveries to make." With that she let go of<br/>Ranma, but not before giving an extra hearty squeeze, and then jumped to a<br/>nearby roof on her way to her next delivery.<p>"You are such a pervert, Ranma. We have better things to do than for you to hug<br/>that Chinese bimbo." Akane-kun said angrily.<p>"Hey!" Ranma-chan exclaimed. "I didn't hug her. She glomped me. How does<br/>that make me a pervert?"<p>Akane-kun just huffed angrily. "Two girls shouldn't hug like that."<p>Now Ranma-chan looked a little hurt. Akane-kun just realized that was probably<br/>not the right thing to say and proving that Ranma was not the only to suffer from<br/>foot-in-the-mouth syndrome. "I mean..." She stammered.<p>Ranma-chan interrupted. "I know you don't like the curse, Akane. I kind of got<br/>that the first day I arrived. I know that no girl would like me like this. Even<br/>Shampoo asked me to change. Welcome to the club." The redhead said bitterly<br/>and stalked off.<p>Akane-kun stood frozen for a second and then raced after the redhead, grabbing<br/>her by the arm to stop her. "I'm sorry, Ranma. I didn't mean to imply that no one<br/>would like you because of your curse. I don't mind. I've never known you<br/>otherwise."<p>Ranma-chan just looked down. "You say you don't mind, but you still keep calling<br/>me a pervert anyway. I'm not, you know."<p>"I do keep finding you in those weird situations."Akane-kun said testily. "Then<br/>how do you explain that?"<p>Ranma-chan looked up and smirked. "Then you're a pervert as well. At least that<br/>was what the girl that threw you out of the bathroom called you."<p>'That was... I mean... " Akane-kun just stammered.<p>"You know this curse attracts trouble." Ranma-chan continues. Perhaps she<br/>could finally convince Akane that not every situation she was found in was her<br/>fault.<p>"I'm not a pervert!" Akane finally exclaimed.<p>At that moment Ranma-chan got a little insight about Akane. "Perhaps she is a<br/>little perverted herself. Just won't admit it. She probably finds my girl form<br/>desirable as well." Ranma-chan thought. A nasty idea surfaced and she smiled<br/>slightly.<p>"Then prove it!" Ranma-chan stated boldly. "I challenge you to prove it."<p>"Huh?" Akane-kun said.<p>"If you can kiss a girl in your guy form. If you lose, you will never call me a pervert<br/>again. If you win, I'll do whatever you say for an entire week." She crossed her<br/>arms and looked at Akane-kun with a smirk. She was confident that Akane would<br/>back down.<p>Akane-kun froze for a second and looked at Ranma-chan in disbelief. He<br/>frowned. He had been challenged, and as a martial artist of the anything-goes<br/>school he could not back down. Especially not now with Ranma looking so smug<br/>right now. A familiar surge of anger started to surge through her body. Ranma<br/>had done it again. This time he would get the upper hand with Ranma. Akane-<br/>kun got an evil glint in his eyes. He started to approach Ranma-chan.<p>The redhead looked startled when Akane-kun started to approach her. She did<br/>not like the look in his eyes. He was planning something, but she didn't know<br/>what. She braced herself in case Akane-kun would pull out a mallet or anything<br/>like that. In doing so she flinched a little, closing her eyes briefly. This was all that<br/>Akane-kun needed. His arms shot forward and he took Ranma-chan in a firm<br/>embrace. He looked down at the girl in his arms. Ranma-chan looked back with<br/>large, startled eyes. She was so shocked that she didn't notice what Akane-kun<br/>was doing until his lips touched hers.<p>Ranma-chan felt warmth spreading throughout her body. The feeling of Akane-<br/>kun's lips on her own sent shivers of pleasure through her spine. Her mind<br/>whirled with conflicting emotions. She should be grossed out being kissed by a<br/>man. But this was Akane, and somehow that made all the difference. Her legs<br/>turned to jelly and her arms unconsciously worked there way around Akan-kun's<br/>neck.<p>When they finally broke to come up for air there was only one thing Akane-kun<br/>could say.<p>"Wow."<p>Then he noticed he was holding a limp Ranma-chan in his arms. The redhead<br/>had a silly grin on her face and glazed eyes. Akane-kun just blinked. He was<br/>brought back to reality when he suddenly heard a voice from nearby.<p>"Oh my. That was some kiss. Ranko-chan has picked up such a manly<br/>boyfriend."<p>Akane-kun looked up and stared at the women in front of the Tendo dojo gate.<br/>Standing there, with a wide smile on her face, was Nodoka Saotome.<p>* * *<p>END PART I<p>* * *<p>Authors note:<br/>I always get complaints my chapters are too short. I hope this will change that<br/>although there is not much change at that. He he. Not until this fic is complete at<br/>least. Speaking of completed fics, I'm bashing myself in the head for starting this<br/>fic despite the fact that I'm still working on two other fic's that are still not<br/>complete. Sorry about that. I couldn't help it. It seems to be the norm anyway. lol.<br/>Hope you will enjoy this story though. I welcome reviews and constructive<br/>criticism. Flames will be used to cook dinner.
