</div>War.<p>War never changes.<p>During the months leading up to what would be known as World War III,<br/>the island nation of Japan took great pains to ensure their survival.<br/>Diplomats and bribes were dispatched to every world power, espionage<br/>agents attempted to neutralize the first-strike capabilities of<br/>neighboring nations, and massive amounts of weapons were imported to<br/>defend the nation from the unlikely event of a land invasion.<p>When the bombs fell, Japan was left unscathed. As the flakes of fallout<br/>enveloped the world, the Japanese congratulated themselves. After the<br/>world had been cleansed, it seemed that Amaterasu's children were<br/>protected from the burning storm. They relaxed and prepared for a new<br/>life, one free of interference from foreign devils.<p>The peace did not last.<p>Japan had become too developed to return to the old ideals of<br/>isolationism. Their cars and trains sat inert, unfueled and unusable.<br/>Rice rotted in the country while men died of starvation in the cities.<br/>Electricity was first rationed, then restricted to government use only,<br/>then nonexistent. With no manufacturing or importing of medicine, the<br/>simplest of diseases became deadly. Wild animals, irradiated by the<br/>fallout, walked the streets without fear, spreading disease and killing<br/>the old and unfit.<p>And through it all, the men quivered, helpless, unable to survive<br/>without the technology that they were so famous for. Many wished that<br/>they, too, had been wiped out in the war. Still more prayed to wake up<br/>from the nightmare that life had become.<p>Eventually, something snapped. Thousands of years of cultural<br/>conditioning had been worn down by eighteen months of hardship. In an<br/>orgy of violence and destruction, they turned on one another. Like wild<br/>animals they slaughtered each other, neighbors killing neighbors,<br/>brothers killing brothers, husbands killing wives. They tore apart<br/>buildings, streets, and infrastructure, as if to spite the civilization<br/>that had so damned them. The city of Tokyo burned for five days. The<br/>streets ran red with blood.<p>Some, however, were able to escape the riots. Many were able to flee the<br/>city into the surrounding wasteland. Some banded together into loose<br/>groups, sharing food and space. They bred. They adapted. They trained.<br/>They survived.<p>Sixty years later, the battered survivors emerged from their hovels and<br/>camps to repopulate the destroyed city of Tokyo. No-one knew just what<br/>drew them to the city they had sworn off decades ago- perhaps one band<br/>began the pilgrimage, and all they met had followed them. Whatever the<br/>case may be, they came back to the city.<p>When the survivors arrived, hearty and toughened by the Wasteland, they<br/>found a ghost town. The toppled buildings were exactly the same as when<br/>the survivors had left. Nothing had been erected, nothing had been<br/>repaired. Nobody was left. The only sounds that greeted them upon<br/>finding the city was the sound of wind whistling through bone. They<br/>squared their jaws and resolved to stay, and to someday return the city<br/>to its former glory. With the help of a strong leader, they would<br/>accomplish this goal within a generation.<p>But the survivors of Tokyo found themselves unable to unite under a<br/>single ruling group. Bickering, suspicious, and greedy for the meager<br/>resources the blasted metropolis held, the survivors toppled and<br/>replaced every single man, woman or group that claimed to rule. During<br/>the short span of five years, the city of Tokyo knew over 80 "rulers".<p>A compromise was eventually reached, after much bloodshed, thinning the<br/>already small population. The city of Tokyo would be divided into wards,<br/>as it had been before the Great War. Each ward would be a self-ruled<br/>city-state, untied to any of the other wards. Soon, boundary lines were<br/>drawn, defenses were erected, and weapons were once again pointed at<br/>neighbors, ready to destroy at a moment's notice.<p>War never changes.<p>One such ward was the ward of Nerima. Lacking in firearms or armor, the<br/>inhabitants of Nerima chose to train extensively in the martial arts in<br/>preparation for invasion by another ward. Far more powerful and agile<br/>than inhabitants of rival wards, they hope their superior technique and<br/>discipline can overcome overwhelming firepower.<p>In the eighteen years Tokyo has existed in its current state, Nerima has<br/>only known three conflicts with other Wards. The last six years have<br/>been relatively peaceful.<p>Life in Nerima Ward is about to change.<p>***<p>R A N M A 1 / 2 : D E C A Y<p>By Paul "Unseen" Durant<p>***<p>"Ugh... It feels like I've been strained through someone's bowels."<p>Saotome Ranma sat up and rubbed his face, to make sure it was still<br/>there. He had that "pins-and-needles" feeling over his whole body, he<br/>felt like his bones had turned to water, he couldn't move his legs, and<br/>he kept seeing little flashes of green light out of the right corner of<br/>his eye, even when it was closed. All in all, he felt like absolute<br/>shit.<p>He fell prone again, most of his energy drained. His head hit the steel<br/>cot with a a dull "thunk", and he-<p>Steel cot?<p>Where WAS he?<p>Ranma's eyes snapped open and he frantically scanned the room, drinking<br/>in every detail. It was about five meters square, with a too-high<br/>ceiling dotted by glaring halogen lights. The walls were dingy,<br/>unpolished steel marred by several areas where the metal had been ripped<br/>away to reveal bundles of crusty cable. He appeared elevated at least<br/>five feet off the ground, though he could not move his head and see for<br/>certain. The far wall of the room, where his feet currently pointed, had<br/>a battered and dented sliding door made of the same material as the<br/>walls and ceiling, and stood next to a filthy window that took up<br/>roughly one-third of the wall.<p>It appeared as if he was in a prewar underground facility, much like the<br/>ones he had trained in and fought through in Manchuria and Korea. If the<br/>rest of the facility was as dirty and unkempt as this one room, then it<br/>was either deserted or occupied by a raider gang who didn't care much<br/>for cleanliness. Ranma doubted he would be able to escape if this was<br/>indeed a raider camp, for not only could he barely move, but he was in<br/>so much pain he couldn't throw a simple unanswered punch without<br/>doubling over, much less engage in combat.<p>Ranma's analysis of the situation was interrupted when he saw a dim<br/>shape moving through the filthy observation window, followed by the<br/>faint beeping of a keycard lock being activated. He tried to ready<br/>himself for combat, but couldn't so much as lift an arm in his current<br/>condition. He closed his eyes as he heard the pressure door slide open,<br/>hoping that the unknown figure would think him asleep and give him more<br/>time to recover before doing... whatever he or she planned to do to him.<p>He heard footsteps coming closer to him, smelled the rank odor of<br/>rotting flesh, felt himself being watched. He could hear the figure<br/>breathing, a moist, phlegmy sound. With every footstep there was a<br/>faintly audible "splortch" that drew ever closer to Ranma's prostate<br/>form. Soon, Ranma could feel the breath on his body, it stank of death<br/>and rot. For a few seconds, Ranma remained there, inhaling the toxic,<br/>cancerous odor of the figure's breath. His eyes watered under their<br/>lids; the stench was unbearable. For a few more seconds he waited for<br/>the figure to move, speak, or act, but the foetor soon became unbearable<br/>- Ranma decided that instead of feigning sleep, he would roll off the<br/>cot away from the smell's emanator, hit the ground, and pray to every<br/>kami that he had enough will and pain resistance to move his legs and<br/>run before he was caught.<p>He was unable to carry out his hastily-fashioned plan, however, as his<br/>attempt to roll caused agony to run up and down his left arm and nothing<br/>else - no movement, no escape. He gasped in pain, then heard a slight<br/>chuckle - the figure must have been amused at the sight. Ranma opened<br/>his eyes to see who it was, seeing no further point in pretending to be<br/>asleep.<p>He was greeted by the most hideous sight he had ever seen in his entire<br/>life. It had the general form of a man, but was twisted into a hideous<br/>mockery of it - Its flesh was marred, misshapen, burnt, rotting, green,<br/>hideous! Green lumpy skin knotted around the creature's joints and was<br/>absent on areas of the skull and chest, exposing sickly yellow bone. The<br/>arms were gaunt and skeletal, liquified flesh dripped from them onto the<br/>floor below. It wore a tattered and bloodstained smock of some sort, as<br/>well as frayed pants covered in what appeared to be years' worth of<br/>filth and grime. The worst aspect by FAR, Ranma thought, were its eyes.<br/>Its left eye hung from its socket, suspended by a frayed and rotting<br/>optic nerve. The other eye was bloodshot and splotchy; it appeared to<br/>have some sort of fungus growing in the whites of its eyes - they were<br/>more mauve-yellow than white. The pupil was clouded immensely, and yet<br/>the lone functioning eye was looking directly at him as the creature<br/>began to smile, lips cracking to reveal a row of broken teeth and a<br/>mouth full of metal and leather.<p>Ranma vomited at the sight of it, and had passed out from pain and<br/>terror before the expectoration hit his chest.<br/>Gradually and groggily, Ranma came to. The pain had subsided to the<br/>point where he could move without wincing, and he felt as if he had at<br/>least SOME control over his body. He lifted his head - noting that he<br/>was now situated in a chair instead of a cot - to analyze his<br/>surroundings once more, praying that the hideous creature wasn't nearby.<br/>He was bound to the chair by crude knots on his wrists and ankles, as he<br/>soon discovered, and though sloppily made they were far too tight for<br/>his comfort. The room he was in showed a great deal more maintenance<br/>than the last; the walls were polished to a shimmering surface and there<br/>were hardly any missing panels. He couldn't see the entrance, it must be<br/>behind him - he dared not entertain the possibility there WAS no<br/>entrance - but he could see that his clothes had been removed in favor<br/>of a large, voluminous labcoat and a threadbare blanket. His original<br/>clothes lay at his feet; he certainly recognized his leather jacket with<br/>one sleeve missing from a fight with an angry Deathclaw, but he didn't<br/>remember vomiting on it. There were no weapons in sight, if he was to<br/>survive, he would need to escape, get armed, and find his father - if<br/>indeed his father was alive. He struggled with his bonds, causing the<br/>chair to rotate slightly, but after three minutes of exertion and wrist<br/>pain, he was no closer to escaping the ropes.<p>From behind him, he heard a -Whissh- noise, followed by a voice like a<br/>prolonged bullfrog's croak.<p>"Well, hello, Mary Sunshine. Had enough beauty rest by now?" Ranma<br/>screamed involuntarily at the voice of the interloper. He was vaguely<br/>aware that he really shouldn't be this afraid, that he wasn't quite<br/>himself, but that was mostly eclipsed by the feeling that he was going<br/>to die here.<p>He felt a hand near his shoulder, warm, wet, and disgusting. The chair<br/>he was in spun a hundred-eighty degrees, revealing the speaker. Ranma<br/>screamed again, louder, throatier. He saw the same creature as before -<br/>no, not the same, a different one, with its own signs and methods of<br/>decay. It crossed its skeletal, ghastly arms in a pose that might have<br/>been considered impatience. Its filthy maw opened and it said, in a<br/>quite matter-of-fact tone, "Oh, for the love of... Didn't we already do<br/>this?"<p>The creature made a gesture of exasperation, turned around, tapped a key<br/>on the door behind it, and walked out as the door slid open. It was when<br/>the door slid back closed that Ranma screamed for a third time, the<br/>longest and loudest he'd bellowed in his entire life.<p>The continued action of the door-panel, over the years, had both served<br/>to wear away on the door and polish it, resulting in a portal so<br/>flawless and shined that it could be used as a mirror. Ranma saw within<br/>it his reflection, as clear as if in a reflecting pool. In it he saw<br/>himself altered - his hair, for one, had become blood-red, his face had<br/>gone from that of a scarred man to that of a pristine Chinese woman, and<br/>worst of all, the lab coat had flopped open to reveal a breast erupting<br/>from his chest, and hinted at the presence of its sister.<p>His eyes went wide with panic. He could barely comprehend - it wasn't<br/>- How did this HAPPEN? No doubt it was the work of the ghoulish<br/>creature he had seen before, but why would it do such a thing - and<br/>more importantly, HOW? If it was skilled or powerful enough to do THIS<br/>to his body, why was it incapable of repairing itself? Why didn't Ranma<br/>remember any of this happening? Where was this place? Why, who, what,<br/>how, why, why, why...<p>The questioned drizzled through Ranma's mind like a cold stream, dulling<br/>in intensity and urgency as his panic gave way to an icy affinity for<br/>combat. The questions would wait. First, he must escape, find his<br/>father, and slay his captor. All other concerns were tertiary.<p>***<p>Saotome Genma, warrior, scholar, vagabond, founder of the Saotome School<br/>of Anything-Goes Martial Arts, and father of the trans-migrated martial<br/>artist who at this moment was formulating a plan to escape captivity,<br/>was not a man who jumped to conclusions. He recognized that the barren<br/>Wastelands held far more than he could ever hope to see, and was aware<br/>that for every inexplicable phenomena he could experience, there was<br/>most certainly a perfectly rational and logical explanation. He was<br/>however hard-pressed to find one to explain the fact that he possessed<br/>black and white fur, three-inch claws instead of fingers, and a bizzare<br/>craving for plant life. He told himself that this unknown but existant<br/>explanation would also tell him why he was co-operating as two creatures<br/>who resembled green, molten humans took bits of his blood, skin, and<br/>hair and compared it with some obscure data displayed on an aging<br/>cathode ray tube built into the wall of his perfectly rational, normal,<br/>and explicable polished steel cell.<p>There had to be an explanation. Saotome Genma just wasn't sure he wanted<br/>to hear it.<p>He had felt sundering pain when he had first awakened in this state, but<br/>that had mercifully subsided. Soon after awakening, the first of these<br/>cratures had met him, communicating in halting and unskilled Japanese.<br/>Genma did not remember the exact words of the conversation - he was<br/>still groggy and in quite a lot of pain at that time - but the jist of<br/>it was that the decaying ghoulish creature had been watching over Genma<br/>for more time than it had wanted to do so, and was relieved that his<br/>custodial duties were now at an end. He made a passing reference to<br/>another "patient" - Genma wondered if it was perhaps his son.<br/>Unfortunately, he had not been able to respond to the ghoul's monologue,<br/>as he found himself incapable of vocalization, merely one of many<br/>bizzare afflictions that he wanted an explanation for.<p>Without conversation, the creature had evidently become bored, and left.<br/>This allowed Genma some time to ruminate on his condition, none of which<br/>was productive in any way. After fruitlessly pondering what had stricken<br/>him for the fourteenth time, Genma had resigned himself to the fact of<br/>his new form, and had immediately elected to take a nap. He was awakened<br/>by the two creatures now present and beginning their testing.<p>Genma, with inadept eyes he had not yet grown accustomed to, tried to<br/>make out what the creatures were observing on the monitor and regarding<br/>with such disdain. It was a fruitless effort, since Genma would not have<br/>been able to read the language even if his eyes were working normally,<br/>but he would rather occupy himself with futility then sit there<br/>fretting.<p>After some time had passed - Genma couldn't be sure how long - the<br/>creatures whispered to one another, turned in unison, and regarded him.<br/>"You are a very lucky man", the one on the right said in much more adept<br/>Japanese than the first creature he had seen, "to have survived an<br/>incident such as this. To be honest, we had no idea what the effects on<br/>you would be. Personally, I didn't think you'd even regain<br/>consciousness."<p>"Don't try to speak, sir," said the other. "I know you must be confused,<br/>but for now you just have to cooperate. You'll be able to ask all the<br/>questions you want once we fix you up."<p>The first nodded assent and resumed speaking. "Your system has endured<br/>quite a bit of shock. You might want to refrain from physical activity<br/>for - but I'm getting ahead of myself. First..." he tapped a button<br/>near the monitor and spoke into it. "Miss Heng, could you please bring<br/>in a pot of boiling water for our friend here?"<p>If he had anything else to say, it was cut off by the sound of the<br/>pressure door opening to reveal a short, red-haired woman, wearing a<br/>familiar leather jacket and toting what looked to be a shiv made of<br/>wall-paneling. The creature began to say something in a language Genma<br/>couldn't identify - then the woman charged and attacked, plowing her<br/>shoulder into its gut while plunging the shiv into its knee.<p>The first creatue gurgled a cry of pain as its leg buckled and it<br/>collapsed to the floor. The second, in panic, swung a wild punch at the<br/>female assailant. The woman efortlessly pivoted out of the way of the<br/>attack, and while the creature's arm was extended, brought the base of<br/>her palm up into the crature's elbow while at the same time slamming<br/>down on it with her wrist. With a sickening *SNAP* the limb bent in ways<br/>a limb was never meant to do, and the creature howled an indistinct cry<br/>of pain and went down, joining its bretheren in the floor's cold steel<br/>embrace.<p>Having incapacitated both her opponents in the span of seconds, the<br/>woman whirled to face Genma, her body loose as if prepared for an<br/>attack. She stared at Genma, obviously unsure as to whether or not he<br/>posed a threat. Genma, to his credit, tried to remain calm and act as<br/>inconspicuous as an ex-human panda hundreds of feet below the surface of<br/>the Earth in a pre-war medical facility could be. This effort was<br/>hampered somewhat by the gnawing suspicion about the woman Genma felt<br/>growing in his gut.<p>After staring at the marsupial for a few moments, the woman obviously<br/>deemed it to not be a threat, and returned to the matter of the two<br/>ghouls whimpering in the fetal position at her feet. The one whom she<br/>had attacked first seemed most coherent, he was actually cursing, as<br/>opposed to the other who could only vocalize grunts and moans. She<br/>slipped her foot under the creature's chest and snapped it upwards,<br/>throwing the skeletal green body upwards into position for her to grab<br/>it by the neck and hoist its face to eye level.<p>"Start talking," she spat, and delivered a savage punch to the<br/>creature's stomach.<p>The creature wheezed, "What do you- about what?"<p>"I think you know damn well about what!" the woman shouted, before<br/>tightening her grip on its neck and flinging it into the wall.<p>Though still wheezing and obviously stunned, the creature managed to<br/>respond. "I can't, I didn't do anything... if you'd just let me<br/>explain..."<p>The woman stalked toward the prone ghoul, shoulders arched, head angled<br/>toward her prey, eyes betraying an animal fury. "If you didn't do<br/>anything, then how do you explain this?" She tugged at the jacket she<br/>wore - black leather with one arm torn off, Genma now noticed - to<br/>reveal her naked chest. "I don't care what your explanation is, or how<br/>you did it, or even IF you did it, all I want is for you to UN-do it!"<br/>The distance between her and it closed, she stomped on the creature's<br/>ribs. Genma got the feeling the woman cared less about an un-doing than<br/>she cared about hurting the creature.<p>The ghoul barked a cry of pain, then began to beg. "Please, please," it<br/>gasped, "just stop and I'll be able to help you, if only you'll -"<p>"Freeze right there!" came the cry from across the room, causing both<br/>Genma and the woman to turn and face the direction of the noise. There<br/>stood the second ghoul, left arm hanging limp at an odd angle, hunched<br/>over in pain, and leaning on a wall for support - clutching in his good<br/>hand a magneto-laser pistol, aimed at the woman's head. A small panel in<br/>the wall hung open, an unnoticed emergency locker from which the ghoul<br/>had culled the weapon. "Now I want you to put your hands in the air -<br/>slowly - and step away from Doctor Chi." The woman bristled. Neither<br/>party seemed to acknowledge Genma's presence, and he pondered if this<br/>was something to be thankful for.<p>The woman obliged, slowly raising her hands aloft and taking a step away<br/>from the prone ghoul. No longer under attack, the ghoul tried to regain<br/>its footing - but found it too painful and just decided to lay there<br/>and moan. For a few seconds the scene stood still, save for the shaking<br/>of the ghoul's pistol in its clumsy hand.<p>Then in a flash, the woman howled and propelled herself forward.<br/>Expecting to be charged, the ghoul panicked and fired in front of him -<br/>missing entirely, as the woman had leapt to the right before he had even<br/>put pressure on the trigger. Missing even the tail end of the woman's<br/>crimson pigtail, the searing bolt of coherent light struck the wall of<br/>the chamber, melting a patch of metal to reveal the wiring behind it.<br/>The ghoul moaned as he heard the *frrrzzzzZZZZZZT* of the pistol drawing<br/>power from its cell; he knew he wouldn't get a second shot.<p>He didn't even see where the attack came from when his legs were swept<br/>from under him, but as he fell he saw all too clearly the woman<br/>crouching beneath him, her fist rising to meet his chin. The ghoul's<br/>frail body was propelled upward as they connected, his head nearly<br/>separated from his shoulders. The instant she hit, the woman skidded<br/>backwards upon the steel floor, rising as she did so, performing a wide<br/>roundhouse kick. As the creature slid down the wall, green flesh peeling<br/>off in streaks upon its shiny surface, the woman's foot met his chest.<br/>She kept her leg extended, pinning the creature to the wall.<p>Genma did not need this show of combat prowess and savagery to tell him<br/>who he saw fighting (and destroying) the two ghouls. He knew quite well,<br/>but preferred not to believe himself. After all, there was a slim<br/>possibility he was wrong... but he doubted it.<p>The woman glared at her captive prey and spat. "You wanna play hero<br/>again, huh? You want me to kill you instead of your friend over there?"<br/>As the creature extended his good arm to shoot, the woman snatched the<br/>pistol from him effortlessly, without even breaking the flow of her<br/>speech. "I can't tell either of you apart. Could be, YOU'RE the one who<br/>did this to me. Could be, I should have been killing YOU."<p>The pressure door once again slid open with the now-menacing "hiss". Not<br/>even looking toward the sound, the pinned ghoul howled, "Throw it on<br/>her! NOW!"<p>From the doorway came flying a pot's worth of scalding water. The woman<br/>dropped her leg and spun to face the assailant, but her position was too<br/>awkward and she found she could not dodge in time. Struck by the spray,<br/>she bellowed and collapsed, writhing as if bathed in acid, voice<br/>ululating in a way Genma doubted normal human vocal cords could create.<p>***<p>Ranka saw the early days, as he often did when he was unconscious. The<br/>scene had probably played behind Ranma's eyelids a thousand times or<br/>more - just about a decade ago, when his father had taken him on a boat<br/>into Manchuria, and broken his arm. Genma thought it would teach Ranma a<br/>valuable lesson best imparted early. Ranma did not echo the sentiment.<p>"What the flapping fuck did you do that for, Pops?' he howled, once the<br/>animal cries of pain had passed his lips.<p>"You let me," came Genma's deadpan reply.<p>Ranma looked about to speak, but just bit his lip and held back another<br/>cry of pain. His right arm dangled uselessly at his side. "Damn it,<br/>Pops, how am I supposed to fight if I can't use my right arm?"<p>"Learn to fight with your left. I think you'd best do so quickly," Genma<br/>replied, before effortlessly flipping forward and landing a hard kick to<br/>Ranma's stomach. Genma could have broken both of the boy's legs as well,<br/>but that would be counterproductive. Ranma took the hit without so much<br/>as an attempt as a block, and fell over in a heap, landing on his arm<br/>and provoking a new outburst of howling.<p>Genma broke off a stick of bamboo from the shoots around him with a<br/>little effort, the broke another and tossed it to his son. "Are you a<br/>man, or are you a mewling gecko pup? Get up and fight me, you<br/>pantywaist!" He brought the stick down, hard, on the boy's broken arm.<br/>He screamed, but not so much this time.<p>"What's wrong with you, Pops? You said we were going for a training<br/>trip, not a torture session!"<p>"Less talking, more fighting." Genma slammed him again, this time across<br/>his face. The boy yelped. "And if you think I'll show pity or remorse,<br/>you're wrong. In fact, I won't even give you a splint until you've<br/>managed to hit me. Better get to fighting, son!" Genma swung again, this<br/>time for the chest, only to find his strike blocked by the boy's staff,<br/>clumsily held upright to guard himself. Genma knew it would be easy to<br/>throw the staff from his hands with another strike or to simply strike<br/>again before the boy could block, but that would be too hard on a boy of<br/>six.<p>Besides, he was already learning.<p>***<p>As Ranma faded into the past, Ryoga Hibiki was concerned only with the<br/>present. He checked the shells in his Casull .45 revolver one last<br/>time, as if the sheer joy emanating from him might have caused the ammo<br/>to vanish from existence. He then looked at the tracks again, to assure<br/>himself once more that it was not some hallucination.<p>Sure enough, they were there - one set of tracks from a barefoot<br/>heavyset man in his forties, one from a slim teenaged boy wearing two<br/>differently-sized shoes. They led into the underground bunker, and they<br/>did not come back out again. They were fresh in the mud, no more than a<br/>day old. The boy and his father were probably still in there.<p>After three years of chasing them and seven years of being lost in the<br/>radioactive wilderness, after countless times he had stumbled upon a<br/>three-week old campfire or a months-forgotten Nuka-Cola bottle, Ryoga<br/>had found them.<p>"You've made my life hell, Saotome," Ryoga said to himself, "and now,<br/>finally, I will have my revenge."<p>He thumbed back the hammer of his revolver and dashed into the shining<br/>steel bunker with a madman's grin painted across his face.<p>-<p>Ranma 1/2 and all related characters and indica are copyright to Rumiko<br/>Takahashi.<br/>Fallout, its setting, and all related indica are copyright to Interplay.
