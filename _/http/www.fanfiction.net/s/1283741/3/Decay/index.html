</div><p>Ryoga stood triumphantly over Genma's prone form. "Because of the<br/>Saotomes, I have seen Hell. Now, I get to send one of them there."<p>Genma didn't move.<p>Ryoga crouched and leaned in close. "I bet you thought you could run<br/>forever, didn't you? I bet you thought you'd get off."<p>Genma didn't move.<p>"No... I bet you knew that I would beat you. Deep down, I bet you did.<br/>That's why you were running. Running like all the devils of Hell were at<br/>your feet. You were scared of me. You were a coward."<p>Genma didn't move.<p>"Well now, it's all over. I'm going to put you out of my misery. Then,<br/>I'm going to find your son, and I'm going to kill him, too. Two rounds<br/>to the back of the head. Nice and clean. Not like you." Ryoga started to<br/>reach for the rusty scalpel he kept in a pouch on his belt.<p>Genma made his move.<p>Ryoga's next words would have been "you, I'm going to make you suffer",<br/>but he never got the chance. Rising from the floor like an angered<br/>cobra, the base of Genma's hand collided with Ryoga's nose. Caught off<br/>guard, thinking more of peeling off Genma's skin one layer at a time<br/>than of the possibility the older fighter was not down for the count,<br/>Ryoga took the full brunt of the attack, sending cartilage flattened<br/>into his skull and a hot spray outward. Genma's face, clothes, fingers<br/>were spattered in blood.<p>Genma rolled sideways, lifting his body off of his other arm, but Ryoga<br/>was on his feet and clutching the bloody geyser in the center of his<br/>face. Genma rose, slowly, knowing that the combination of the bleeding<br/>and the humilitation meant that Ryoga wasn't about to come close again.<br/>"Saotome Genma never runs from a fight. NEVER." He spat out a mixture of<br/>blood and saliva. "Can Ryoga say the same of himself?"<p>Ryoga tried to sound tough, but couldn't manage it with blood filling<br/>his sinuses. "Dis isn't ober, Saotobe!"<p>Genma sighed. "It never is, with you."<p>Then Ryoga was gone, leaving a trail of small red spatters on the floors<br/>of the facility. Genma didn't bother to give chase; he knew from<br/>previous encounters that if Ryoga didn't want to be caught, no force on<br/>Heaven or Earth could catch up with him. He waited at the elevator for a<br/>few minutes, to make sure the boy wouldn't double back, then went down<br/>to speak with Dr. Ren.</p><p>Once out of Jusenkyo and following the directions given to him by the<br/>ghoulish doctor, it would be three weeks before the Saotomes would see<br/>another human being, and it would not be on friendly terms. Genma knew<br/>they were being followed for about a week before their trail was bold<br/>enough to step forward; Ranma had only noticed it three days prior. It<br/>wasn't Ryoga, he knew that much, for he gave too much of his position<br/>away and hesitated far, far too long in the attack.<p>They had encountered highwaymen before, and always dispatched them with<br/>ease, partially due to their superiority in combat and partially because<br/>any raiders with the skills and weaponry to defeat them wouldn't bother<br/>with such obvious destitutes. No, when the Saotomes were attacked, it<br/>was usually by the mad, the desperate, or both, and the case was the<br/>same this time.<p>Genma knew the attack was coming, probably before the attacker did, but<br/>purposely did nothing; this was, after all, a training trip for his<br/>son's benefit, and sons did not become stronger by having their fathers<br/>do things for them.<p>The attack came from above, a young man leaping from the canopy of trees<br/>holding a crude spear. Ranma had him disarmed, flat on his back, and<br/>with the shaft of his weapon over the attacker's neck in less time than<br/>it would have taken him to fall out of the tree unhindered. Genma was<br/>duly impressed at his son's prowess.<p>"Very nice, boy." Ranma nodded, then stepped off the attacker's chest to<br/>allow Genma room to deal with him. Genma grabbed both ends of the spear<br/>- not much more than a stick with a scrap of metal embedded in one<br/>side, he noticed - and looked into the attacker's eyes. He was no more<br/>than a child, even younger than Ranma was, and as with all these cases,<br/>Genma thought it his duty to scare him a little. More than a little.<p>"Just what did you think you were doing, kid?" Genma asked, lifting up<br/>on the spear just enough for enough air to pass that the kid could<br/>answer.<p>"I-" he gasped, "- I heard some travelers were coming through the<br/>forest, and, and I thought you were merchants! Oh God, if I'd have<br/>known it was you, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have, oh God please don't<br/>kill me, please urk"<p>Genma pressed down, tired of the boy's simpering. "Don't try to flatter<br/>me. You don't know who I am. You didn't care, either, until my son laid<br/>you out. What's your name, boy?" Again, he lifted the shaft.<p>"Please, please don't kill me, I'm sorry, I'm too young urk"<p>Genma pushed down again. "Tell me your name, and don't tell me anything<br/>else. Do you understand?" He lifted again.<p>The kid responded, as calmly as he could, though stuttering on the verge<br/>of tears. "My name is T-tuh-Taro, muh-mister-"<p>"NO!" Genma howled. "YOUR NAME IS DOGSHIT! YOUR NAME IS GOD-DAMN FUCKING DOGSHIT, NOW TELL ME YOUR FUCKING NAME BEFORE I RIP YOU OPEN LIKE A FUCKING FISH!"<p>"muh-my name is duh-duh-duh-Dogshit, sir!"<p>"That's right, Dogshit! Now, if I let you go, what are you going to do?"<br/>"Dogshit" started to answer, but Genma cut him off. "I'm going to tell<br/>you what you're going to do. First, I am going to lift up your weapona<br/>and allow you to get up onto your hands and knees. If you try to run<br/>away from me, I am going to kill you. Second, you are going to crawl<br/>over to the campfire. You're not going to stand up, because you don't<br/>have the right to stand up. Only real men can stand tall. You're going<br/>to crawl on your hands and knees like a dog. Third, you are going to<br/>take a handful of that - " Genma gestures to the ashes in the ring of<br/>stones that marked where their fire had been - "and you are going to<br/>eat it. Do you know why you're going to eat it, Dogshit?"<p>Dogshit slowly shook his head, his eyes as wide as the moon and staring<br/>up in nameless terror.<p>"I'm going to teach you a lesson, Dogshit. Because see, Dogshit, I like<br/>you. I wanna help you out. And if you keep trying stupid shit like this,<br/>you're going to get killed. And I don't want you to be killed, that<br/>wouldn't be too nice - now would it? And I'm gonna teach you not to do<br/>anything like this ever again. Oh, it'll be bad now, but buck up, kid!<br/>You've got your whole life ahead of you!"<p>Genma's speech by this point was no longer the screaming, enraged<br/>insanity he had used before. Now, he used the cooing, friendly<br/>instability that people found so much more dangerous.<p>"So, after you have your meal, you aren't done yet. Fourth, I am going<br/>to break your legs. Maybe just one of them, depending on how well you're<br/>doing. Then, last, me and my boy are going to leave. You can stay here.<br/>If you can get back to whatever hovel you crawled out from alive,<br/>that'll be great! You can just stay here of course - always plenty of<br/>ash for you to eat - but I don't think you want to be around here when<br/>the wanamingoes come by. They're attracted to screams. 'Course, if I<br/>hear you call for help, I'll kill you before they get the chance. You<br/>understand all of that, Dogshit? For your sake, I hope you do."<p>The boy nodded and swallowed, the lump in his throat stopped halfway<br/>down by the spear over his neck.<p>"Good. Now, come on, get up! Don't want to waste any time, now!"<br/>Genma lifted the weapon from the boy's throat and stepped off of his<br/>body. Trying to choke back sobs - and failing - the boy turned over.<br/>He rose on his arms, collapsed onto them, and abandoned all efforts to<br/>hold back his tears. He turne toward Genma, tears streaking down his<br/>ruddy face, looking for some word, some expression, some movement from<br/>the man to show that it's okay, you've done enough, you can stop now.<p>Genma's face was stone and impassive.<p>Dogshit - Taro - gulped and rose on his arms again, this time staying<br/>stable upon them. He stepped forward once, twice, then terror shook him<br/>and he collapsed once more. He thought he heard movement from behind him<br/>and rose once more without even looking back. He crawled forward, the<br/>palms of his hands pierced by the uneven and rocky soil. He finally<br/>pulled himself to the remains of the fire. He stopped a moment, shifted<br/>his weight to his left arm, reached out with his right. The ashes coated<br/>his hand the instant he touched them, a fine powder working into every<br/>crevice and wound on his palm, a dust inside the joints of his fingers,<br/>making grey lines where the skin folded. He held a small mound in his<br/>hand and looked back once more, expecting this time, this time, that he<br/>would be told he could stop. This was cruel. It was wicked. Nobody would<br/>do this. Certainly, the man would laugh a dark laugh and say that that<br/>was enough, that his point had been proven?<p>"Eat up," Genma nodded. "Eat up if you want to grow up to be big and<br/>strong. If you ever want to grow up at all."<p>Taro winced his eyes together first as reflex, then kept them shut so he<br/>couldn't see the meal in front of him. He opened wide and pulled the<br/>hand closer to his mouth. Simply bringing it closer had dried his mouth.<p>Then, hoping to end it quickly, he stuffed the hateful mound into his<br/>open mouth all at once.<p>The reaction was immediate and the taste horrific. Before he could even<br/>close his mouth, he had already spit out a good portion of it, choking,<br/>dying on its dryness. It devoured every speck of moisture in his mouth,<br/>in his entire body. He was sure he felt sand running through his veins.<br/>The grey powder coated every surface within his mouth. His tongue, his<br/>tonsils, his cheeks, all felt as if they had been turned to ash as well.<br/>He swallowed the hateful dust; first only a tiny amount. He tried to<br/>swallow again and gagged, spitting up another grey cloud. He fell over<br/>and rolled onto his back, then commenced coughing and choking as if he<br/>was seconds away from death. His eyes rolled back in his head, and the<br/>thought to look at Genma was far from his mind.<p>Genma was ready to finish the encounter, and without a word walked to<br/>the prone, spasming form of the boy. He stepped on the boy's right leg<br/>to steady it as it jerked to and fro, then sat down upon the boy's knee.<br/>He placed one hand near the knee, one hand near the ankle, and pushed<br/>inward. The bone snapped with a mimimum of effort, and Genma stood up<br/>again. The boy tried to howl in pain, having forgotten any warning,<br/>admonition or danger after being consumed by agony, but no sound would<br/>escape the ashen tomb of his mouth.<p>Genma grabbed his traveling pack from the ground and started walking in<br/>the direction he was set on at Jusenkyo; and Ranma soon followed. The<br/>son maintained silence until he thought they were out of the boy's<br/>earshot, then spoke up.<p>"That was pretty vicious, Pops. He was just a kid."<p>Genma's tone was pleasant and conversational, now that he no longer was<br/>trying to intimidate someone. "He'll live. Most likely. If he dies, it<br/>would be just as if he had ambushed a traveler not so forgiving as I.<br/>And if he survives, he will carry this lesson with him the rest of his<br/>life."<p>"Yeah, but that's a hell of a way to teach someone a lesson, especially<br/>when they were just being young and foolish."<p>"Mercy never hardened anyone," said Genma, and that was that.</p><p>They saw it days before they reached it; it was impossible to miss once<br/>they were nearby. The forest stopped as abruptly as if some artists had<br/>ceased to draw them into the Earth, and the nearly flat, white and grey<br/>plain stretched out into the horizon in mockery of all works, of all<br/>things. It was the corpse-city they had both heard of in their travels,<br/>and the place that they were told they would find a wise elder who could<br/>help them with their newfound encumbrances. It was Beijing. The legends<br/>said it was once a thriving city of thousands of thousands - millions.<br/>Now the wind passing over it sounded like the last breath of a body<br/>lowered into his grave.<p>Once they set foot upon the crushed, powdered reamins of the city, they<br/>had expected some form of welcome. They knew the elder was not alone<br/>here, and thought that whether or not the elder knew of their coming,<br/>that her guards would patrol around her home. They found no-one. Behind<br/>them were green matchsticks sticking up from the horizon. Ahead as far<br/>as the eye could see, the city was as flat as if the hand of some cruel<br/>God had reached from the heavens and pressed it down.<p>Tired, they made camp for the day when they reached the outskirts. When<br/>they awoke, the sun had sunk below and they still had not been met by<br/>the guardians of this place. Ranma and Genma looked at each other,<br/>shrugged, and began their hike over shattered glass and molten metal, on<br/>to the horizon.</p>
