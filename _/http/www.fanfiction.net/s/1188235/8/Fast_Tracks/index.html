</div><p>Diskuramer:  Any similarities to real or imagined events are fictional. I claim no ownership of the characters presented within.</p><p>Chapter 8:  Along came a spyder</p><p>The morning started off with rain lightly pattering against the window of Ranma's room. It was a pleasant sound that would lull the awake to asleep and keep the asleep calmed and dead to the world. Except, of course, if one needed to go to the bathroom then it sounded like... well you get the idea.</p><p>This was how Ranma greeted the day as a semi urgent need to release the pressure valves on his bladder. The second thing that he noticed was that he was in his half cheetah form and that he was naked and really tired. The last time this had happened was when the girls dragged him off for a night of rutting. Looking to his left then right he noted that he was framed yet again by a naked Shampoo and Makoto confirming his suspicions about a night of heavy activity. It was something of a regular occurrence now that he would find them sleeping next to him, and something that he knew that he'd miss if he ever woke up and they weren't there beside him.</p><p>That wasn't important right at this minute. What was important was he had to take a leak and they were framing him so he couldn't get out.  Sighing because he knew the only way to get free would be to wake them and he was really reluctant to do that. Giving up he decided to nudge Shampoo first. After a bit of stimulation her eyes fluttered open. They were bloodshot like his probably were from staying up way too late and getting up way too early.</p><p>"What Airen want? Is too too early." Shampoo said in that tired morning voice.</p><p>"Could you let go I've got to go to the bathrrrroom." He replied indicating his trapped arm.</p><p>"Fine.  Shampoo go back to sleep now." She mumbled as she turned over onto her other side and went back to sleep.</p><p>Now Ranma turned to Makoto and started nudging her.</p><p>"Wh wnt?" She said still more than 3/4 asleep.</p><p>"Turrrn overrr I want to get up." Ranma said softly as she too was in hybrid form.</p><p>She turned away from him subsequently releasing his other arm.</p><p>Now that he was free all he had to do was quietly sneak out of bed, piss, and then come back so they could reabsorb him into their little cuddle session. Now all he had to do was get rid of that pressure on his abdomen and nether regions.</p><p>"Wait a minute."</p><p>He looked to his left and saw Shampoo facing away from him. He looked to his right and saw Makoto in the same position. He looked down and saw a lump where there shouldn't have been one. He ripped off the covers and looked down afraid of what he'd find.</p><p>Ukyo  Naked Signs of 'activity' = he was so going to die.</p><p>Due to a sudden drop in temperature due in part to a sudden loss of a blanket shocked the three sleeping girls wide awake. Makoto and Shampoo were the first to voice their displeasure at being woken up in such a manor.</p><p>"What the hell!" Makoto screeched.</p><p>"Airen better have good explanation about why wake up wife or else."  Shampoo said in a deadly calm voice punctuating her statement with a non silverednon-silvered dagger to his throat.</p><p>Instead of answering he decided to address a more important issue.</p><p>"Morrrning Ucchan. Umm what arrre you doing herrre?"</p><p>"Mmm Ranchan?" She said as her eyes fluttered open. "I'm not in my bed am I?"</p><p>"Uhh no."</p><p>"That's not my stuffed animal snake is it?"</p><p>"Again uhh no."</p><p>"I'm pretty sore you know down there. Did we...?"</p><p>Ranma looked at the used condom stuck to the ceiling, the two stuck to the door and the three stuck to the glass on his TV.</p><p>"My sourrrces say yes."</p><p>"Airen/Ranma."  Shampoo and Makoto growled out at the same time. Strangely enough it was Shampoo that sounded more like the wild animal.</p><p>"Don't kill me I'm endangerrred!" Ranma screamed as he felt Shampoo press the dagger harder into his throat.</p><p>"Dagger not silver can't kill Airen just make sure he no start wandering like tomcat."</p><p>"I'd have to agree. It's always best to nip a problem in the bud before it becomes something serious." She unsheathed her claws. "Do I have to nip?"</p><p>"Ahh no, nono no need forrr that." He said nervously as he gently pushed her claws off to a 'safe distance'.</p><p>Waking up a bit more Ukyo decided to sit up a bit so that she would be in a more defensible position. She winced as something dug into her insides. She reached in and pulled out the dildo like object. It was a red plastic rod with a green stylized numeral 4 on top. The shaft was sheathed in a condom which after sitting inside her for most of the night was quite thoroughly soaked. All in all it looked like a child's toy that had been turned into an impromptu sex toy.</p><p>"What's this thing?" Ukyo asked the other three who were still arguing.</p><p>"Oh no not another one." Groaned Makoto as she saw that yet another of the defective Senshi pens had gotten into the hands of yet another of Ranma's old fiancées.</p><p>"Shampoo think about go back on word about not kill pervert senshi."</p><p>"Senshi?  Ranma what is she talking about?" Ukyo asked as she pulled the condom off the shaft and looked at a piece of masking tape that had a name written on it that was taped to the shaft.</p><p>Ranma just put his hand to his face to cover his eyes. Maybe if he didn't see it, it wouldn't be real.</p><p>"It means that you're now one of the Sailor scouts, a defective one at that. From the looks of it you are the scout of one of my moons."  Makoto said as she got up, changed back into her human form then transformed into Sailor Jupiter.</p><p>"Y...You're... YOU'RE SAILOR JUPITER!" Ukyo screamed going into fangirl mode.  "I'msuchahugefan! Can I get your autograph! No wait I just had sex with THE Sailor Jupiter! Ohmygod ohmygod... (etc)." Ukyo broke down hyperventilating.</p><p>Makoto was in a word stunned. Sure there were rabid Sailor Moon fans all over the place. She was their leader and all. It was just that she had never met a Sailor Jupiter fan. It felt really good.</p><p>While Makoto was basking in the light of Ukyo's fandom and Shampoo was seething about everybody and their dog wanting to sleep with her husband. Ranma was planning his escape.</p><p>Shampoo disengaged Check.</p><p>Makoto disengaged Check.</p><p>Ukyo disengaged... Mostly check.</p><p>All systems ready and lift</p><p>"Urk..."</p><p>Unfortunately Ukyo still had a good grip on his mooring anchor.</p><p>Ranma landed at the foot of the bed. Ukyo had lost her grip about halfway through his arc and as such he was only slightly stretched instead of ripped off. He scrambled into his boxers and took off out the door towards the bathroom before anybody in the room could comment.</p><p>Makoto transformed back into her normal form.</p><p>When he left the room he left the door wide open. Through said wide open door in tromped the rest of the senshi. They all looked like they had a rough night. Their hair was disheveled and their clothing was rumpled. Not only that but during their rush to get dressed they seemed to have gotten their clothes mixed up as none of the girls were wearing the same thing that they came with.</p><p>"I see you guys had a tough night too." Makoto said to her friends.</p><p>"Mmm Hmm." Nodded Minako. "Ranma was great." She sighed wistfully as if remembering something.</p><p>"It was an... interesting experience." Ami commented blushing like crazy.</p><p>Usagi was sniffling.</p><p>"Wahhhhhh I cheated on Mamo chan!"</p><p>"Shut up Meatball Head!" Rei shouted instantly regretting it. One minute she was lying in her bed in her room, the next she was being ravaged by...</p><p>Sufficed to say that her already hair trigger temper was splitting an atom between who would die and who would just suffer.</p><p>"You WHAT!" Screamed Makoto as she instinctavly shifted into her hybrid form.</p><p>The other girls looked nervous. They had a right to be nervous as Makoto started flipping her claws in and out as she clenched and unclenched her hands. Rei had a coughing fit in response to her situation.  Usagi thought she sounded like Luna when she was coughing up a hairball. Makoto rounded on her as she reached into her mouth and pulled several hairs. Makoto was by her side in well under a second and had her wrist locked in a deathgrip.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she checked over the hairs.</p><p>"Blond two different shades, a blue curly, and a... green?" Makoto said as she unconsciously lifted Rei off the ground by her arm.</p><p>"Damn it Makoto let go you're hurting me!" Rei cried out.</p><p>Makoto dropped Rei like a hot potato and jumped back.</p><p>"Oh gods I'm so sorry Rei." Makoto said as she started cowtowing.</p><p>"Damn it I think you broke my wrist!" Rei shouted as she used her good hand to pull out her henshin stick and transformed. Of course during all of this she never noticed Ukyo sitting on the bed staring wide eyed at Rei.</p><p>Rei of course just turned out of the room and stomped away muttering something about stupid perverted cats. Ukyo turned her wide eyed look on the rest of the girls.</p><p>"Umm are you all?" Ukyo asked in a very small voice.</p><p>"Ack!  How long have you been here! You didn't see anything did you? Please don't tell on us or my mother will ground me! What are you doing here? Did you Ranma, Mako chan, and Shampoo all...?"  Usagi managed to get out all in one breath.</p><p>"Usagi she's a scout too now." Makoto said dropping her head.</p><p>"Oh... Welcome to the team." Usagi said with a smile. "So you guys were..." She made a gesture that indicated in some vague way they were screwing like bunnies.</p><p>"That it. Shampoo kill now." She said as she jumped out of bed grabbed a conveniently placed halbred and went hunting.</p><p>"I don't remember much but we found Ukyo in our bed this morning. I think Setsuna has something to do with it because we found another faulty transformation stick with Ukyo this morning. As you know Setsuna has been handing those things out like candy at Halloween lately." Makoto said as she shifted back to her human form and got dressed in a cream coloured blouse and black skirt combo. She also grabbed some clothes for Shampoo as the Amazon didn't take any with her when she went Setsuna hunting.</p><p>"But that's not a bad thing!" Usagi protested. "We're getting so many new friends that are really strong even though the magic doesn't work right. That's a good thing as it means that we won't be so hard pressed to win our fights anymore." Usagi said as she winced.</p><p>"Umm Ami I think I've got your panties." She said as she reached behind and started digging them out of her crack.</p><p>"Umm no I've got my own. I think you've got Rei's." Ami said as she fingered Minako's shirt that she was wearing.</p><p>"So that's why they're bunching up." Usagi ran out of the room to go find Rei. "Hey Rei I've got your panties!"</p><p>"You know only a few short months ago we were just normal defenders of Love and Justice." Minako said as she shook her head. "Oh where ever did we go wrong?" She said as she put her arm around Ami's waist and led her out of the room.</p><p>Makoto watched as Minako's hand slid down lower and grabbed Ami's ass.</p><p>"What has happened to us indeed?" Makoto said not expecting an answer.</p><p>"Ranma happened sugar." Ukyo said from her place on the bed. "It's a bit weirder than normal but this is pretty much par for the course as far as his life goes." She shrugged. "I'm betting that you wouldn't trade it for your 'normal' life would you?"</p><p>Makoto thought about it for a few minutes before responding.</p><p>"You're right. I wouldn't trade this for my normal life." She sat down on the bed. "Before I found out that I was a were cheetah I was just your average magical girl battling the forces of evil. I also couldn't get a date to save my life. I was too tall and too strong.  All the boys were afraid of me as I could beat them all up. When Auntie showed me that I was not human I was freaking. I mean I usually shoot something that looks like me, but it felt so natural and I dunno right that I wondered how I ever did without it."  She raised her hand up to look at it.</p><p>"I guess I always knew that I was different from them in a way. I mean none of them actually liked all the fighting, they just wanted to be normal teenagers. I guess it was the cat in me that wanted to stalk and kill my prey." Ukyo gulped at this. It was a subtle reminder that she was dealing with a wild animal in the guise of a civilized girl. Wild animals had a tendency to bite you if they thought you were threatening them.</p><p>"Well then Auntie decides that I'm not shocked enough and tells me that this hunk was actually engaged to me and that she expects lots of grandchildren. I mean I've only had one boyfriend and even that didn't last long, so to be suddenly engaged to him with expectations that I get knocked up by the next day... I wasn't too pleased with that." She shifted a bit as if remembering something.</p><p>"Then I actually started to get to know the guy. Let me tell you I've never fallen so fast or so hard for anybody, cute face or not."  She smiled. "For all his stupidity and thoughtless words he really does have a heart of gold." She looked at Ukyo. "It's no wonder girls are falling all over him. For all his faults he really is a great guy."</p><p>"So you don't mind if I join you guys as wife #3 then?" Ukyo said with a hopeful smile.</p><p>"Hell no. One extra is almost too much. That's not saying that I don't mind Shampoo's company, she's really great and all. It's just that Ranma has to divide his attention between two girls and he doesn't have enough time really for both of us. I mean I would love to have him to myself but that wouldn't be fair to Shampoo." Makoto paused for a few minutes as if to collect her thoughts. "I'm just afraid that if there are any more girls then he won't have any time for me."</p><p>"That's funny actually. I had the same thoughts when he was still in Nerima.  He had Akane and Shampoo as well but he always made time to visit me. He's just that kind of guy. No matter how many girls were after them he usually found time for all of them." Ukyo said as she scooted a bit closer. "I still want to marry him but if you are, I guess mistress would be good enough for me. I don't need a lot of his time, just a bit now and then."</p><p>"Why should we? It's not like you're engaged to him or anything..."  Makoto trailed off as she saw Ukyo looking down.</p><p>"Well Mrs. Saotome made me this offer. She paid me the amount my dowry was worth plus a little more for pain and suffering. She also said that I could get revenge on her husband. I still have all of the money still in the same envelope, I haven't opened it yet. That and I haven't been able to catch her worthless husband so..." She trailed off letting the implications of her words speak for themselves.</p><p>Makoto stopped to think about it for a bit. She'd have to beat I mean ask Setsuna later about the implications of Ukyo and Shampoo both being senshi of her moons. If this was Setsuna's idea of setting up her boyfriend with other girls she'd have to have a say in it.</p><p>After all Jupiter had a LOT of moons.</p><p>"Well I believe that in the old days if a man wanted to have a mistress his wife would have to approve of the girl. So let's see your resume."  Makoto said.</p><p>"I've got my resume right here." Ukyo said as she leaned in.</p><p>Ranma returned just in time to get hit in the face by Makoto's blouse whichblouse that was flung out the door. He saw his oldest friend making out with his sort of fiancée. It was a good thing he was still in hybrid form as Makoto had shifted to hers as soon as her clothes were off. He watched for a few seconds before deciding to just cut his losses and close the door.</p><p>His stomach growled and he decided that he'd find out about it later.  Right now his main love needed feeding and he knew exactly where to get satisfaction. On his way to the kitchen he saw a naked Shampoo with a very large sword. It looked like she was stalking something so he just passed by without talking to her and giving away her position.</p><p>Once he was at the kitchen he saw his mom cooking breakfast. She was being helped by Ami and Walter's two Amazon wives. Rei was still transformed and had a pack of ice on her wrist. Minako, Usagi, and Setsuna were no where to be seen. Ranma walked up behind his mother and hugged her from behind. Since he was in his hybrid form and she wasn't he pretty much enveloped her.</p><p>"Morrrning mom when's brrreakfast I'm starrrved." Ranma said as his stomach decided to voice it's own opinion.</p><p>"Soon son." She turned away from her cooking and gave her son an 'I'm so happy I've got such a manly son smile.' "So what did you think of the sleeping arrangements?"</p><p>"What do you... oh you mean Ukyo. Umm I rrreally don't know what to think.  Ukyo's my frrriend and all so it was kinda wierrrd to wake up with herrr naked in my bed and all."</p><p>"Ahh so that's who that third lump was." She turned around and went back to cooking. "I was wondering who would be number three."</p><p>"Mom!"  Ranma shouted both horrified and embarrassed by his mother's comment. "I rrreally don't think that's such a good idea. I've got my hands full with Shampoo and Makoto I don't need any morrre girrrls." He paused to think for a second. "Actually I think Shampoo was hunting Setsuna forrr that little stunt she pulled."</p><p>"I wouldn't worry too much about Setsuna. She's much better than your father at getting out of sticky situations."</p><p>"This would be one of those sticky situations. Shampoo's on the warrr path to try and keep the otherrr girls away from me." He said shaking his head.</p><p>"How's Makoto taking all of this?" Nodoka asked as she gave the miso soup a stir and flipped the grilling slabs of meat.</p><p>"Actually I think she's trying to be the dominant female." He said remembering walking in on her and Ukyo.</p><p>"Oh that reminds me we're having a party tonight. Cologne already knows and is going to take Shampoo out. I just want to make it clear this is were cats only." Nodoka said as she turned and looked him right in the eye for emphasis.</p><p>"Um what's that about? Why can't the otherrr girrrls come?" Ranma asked a bit confused by his mother's request.</p><p>"Just trust me on this son. No humans. Were cat parties can get a little... wild and it would be best if they weren't there."  She smiled. "I'm sure they'll understand. Now go gather everybody breakfast is almost ready and you've got school today."  She said as she pushed him on his way and went back to cooking.</p><p>"Ahh alrrright I'll do that." Ranma said as he turned and left the kitchen.</p><p>Ami who'd been listening to the whole conversation decided that since it was were cat only as their creator she should be there. After all they were her people and she had a responsibility to them.</p><p>The thought of partying with lots of hunky were cats never crossed her teenage brain. Nope not once.</p><p>Ranma found Shampoo clinging to the ceiling getting ready to drop on a seemingly unaware Setsuna.</p><p>"Morrrning Setsuna," He looked up at Shampoo. "Shampoo. Brrreakfast is almost rrready."</p><p>"Thanks for telling us. Shampoo was just about to give me a demonstration of how sharp steel and flesh don't mix well." She looked up to where Shampoo was still clinging to the ceiling. "We'll have to do this some other time." She said a she pulled down her eyelid and blew her tongue at her.</p><p>"Just don't forrrget we've still got school today." Ranma said as he walked off to find the other girls.</p><p>"Well then I guess I'll have to get ready for school." Setsuna said as she opened a portal and stepped through it.</p><p>Shampoo only missed by a hair.</p><p>"Shampoo make Pervert Senshi pay!"</p><p>Ranma's next stop was the baths. It was the only place he could think of where Usagi and Minako might be. As he entered the bath he noticed that there were two sets of clothes. Instead of just walking in he decided to just tell them through the divider.</p><p>"Hey girrrls you'd better hurrry up. Mom's got brrreakfast rrready."  Ranma called out.</p><p>"Almost  ohh finished. YES!" Called out a voice he thought sounded like Minako.</p><p>Who knew blonds really did know how to have fun.</p><p>His next stop was Walter's room.</p><p>As he opened the door he saw the disembodied form of Walter flying around the room while his corpse was lying on the bed. Shaking his head he put a little ki into his hand and grabbed Walter as he passed by and shoved his spirit back into his body. Immediately Walter shot to a sitting position and screamed.</p><p>"Nooooooooooooooooo!"</p><p>"Alrrright I'll tell yourrr wives to cool it with the sex forrr a bit." He turned around and was about to leave when he remembered the reason he was there. "Oh yeah brrreakfast is going to be rrready soon.  You may want to get up."</p><p>Ranma turned to leave again when he remembered about the party.</p><p>"Oh yeah mom also said therrre's going to be a parrrty werrre cats only."</p><p>That perked up Walter in no time.</p><p>"A party? Crap, I've got lots of work to do then." Walter said as he shakily got out of bed.</p><p>Ranma averted his eyes as Walter was still naked. Naked girls were fine but he really didn't want to look at some other guysguy's schlong.</p><p>"Yeah she also said no humans allowed. It was rrreally wierd but I guess I just have to trrrust herrr. I guess that means your two bookends won't be able to go eitherrr."</p><p>"No time to waste I've got lots of work to do!" Walter said as he threw on his clothes and rushed out the door.</p><p>"I wonderrr what's so special about this parrrty." Ranma said aloud as he went to go collect the other two. He just hoped that they were finished.</p><p>It was just his luck that he happened to walk in right as Makoto climaxed.  He waited for about half a minute for her to finish before speaking up.</p><p>"Brrreakfast is rrready you two." He said.</p><p>Normally a scene like that would have given him the mother of all nosebleeds only a few weeks ago. Now it was strangely turning him on. Happosai would have been proud.</p><p>Well actually Happosai would have jumped them and fondled them till they screamed bloody murder. But that's another story.</p><p>He walked out of the room and down the stairs to where his breakfast awaited.</p><p>Once he was in the dining room the only other occupant was his old man. Of course he was tied up at the moment. The ball gag was something that he was trying his best not to think about. Sighing he walked around the table to where his father was trussed up. He removed the gag from his mouth and put it on the table.</p><p>"Well pops is mom finished with you yet?" He asked as he walked around the table and sat down in his spot.</p><p>"Boy, how could you betray your father like this! Cavorting with those other two girls while your true fiancee is waiting for you at the Tendo's."</p><p>"And which 'trrrue fiancee' would that be? Hmm? Did you know that both Nabiki and Kasumi werrre herrre earrrlierrr on in the week trrrying to vy vie forrr my attention." He blushed as he remembered exactly what Kasumi was wearing. "Akane couldn't carrre less about me and you know it! Besides I don't know how much morrre sex I can take. Did you know Ukyo was shoved into ourrr bed last night?"  Genma shook his head in the negative. He was of course thinking about how a naked Ukyo, Shampoo, and that new girl Makoto would look naked.</p><p>"Last night I had sex with Makoto, Shampoo and Ukyo. Now mom's got it in herrr head that Ukyo can be my mistrrress orrr something! I mean I don't know if I can handle any morrre girls."</p><p>"You had sex with three girls at the same time and you're complaining! Oh where did I go wrong that my weak and girly son is complaining about too much sex!" Genma shouted in mock indignation. "Now listen to your father boy and listen good. If your mother wants you to have fifty wives and just as many mistresses you don't complain.  It just means that you have to spend less time with each of them."  He smiled as it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>"Pop I don't want to avoid them! The morrre girrrls that are thrown into this mix the less time I'll have to spend with each of them."  He looked down at the table and continued in almost a whisper. "I don't want them to have to sharrre morrre than they alrrready arrre. I don't want to have to divide my attention morrre than it alrrready is." He lowered his voice so that he was sure his old man wouldn't be able to hear it. "I carrre forrr them too much forrr that."</p><p>"It's a good thing too or else I'd have to have a few words with you mister." Makoto said playfully from the door. She was back in her human form and was wearing the blouse that she originally had on.</p><p>"Ack!"  Ranma said eloquently as he realized that he'd done the unthinkable and expressed his emotions somewhere where she could hear him.</p><p>"Don't give me that. A girl likes to hear that her man cares for her every so often. It makes her feel appreciated for more than just a quick romp." She said as she walked over and gave him a big hug. Of course he was much larger than she was so it was a little awkward.</p><p>"Good morning Ranchan!" Ukyo said happily from his other side as she too glomped him.</p><p>"Urk!  U... Ucchan. Umm about last night and all..." He trailed off.</p><p>"I know. Just let me believe for a little while longer. I'll still be your friend but I guess that's pretty much it." She said sadly.</p><p>"Maybe not." Makoto said.</p><p>"Uhh Makoto you'rrre not thinking what I think you'rrre thinking are you?"  Ranma said hesitantly.</p><p>"If Shampoo agrees then she can become one of your mistresses. Shampoo and I will still be your main wives and still have the main say it's just..." She paused to collect her thoughts. "I guess I can see where she's coming from. Besides " She smiled. " sometimes you're just too much man for the two of us." She snickered as she let go of his side.</p><p>"But... but I don't know how much morrre I can take." Ranma stuttered out.</p><p>"Go for it boy! While you're at it take one of the Tendo girls as well!"  Genma spoke up.</p><p>"Actually my husband might just have a good idea." Nodoka said as she walked into the room carrying one of the trays of food; visions of kittens dancing in her head.</p><p>"Mooooooommm!"  Ranma said in extreme embarrassment.</p><p>The rest of the household chose that moment to walk in. Rei of course was in her normal clothes as her wrist had healed faster than she thought it would.</p><p>"Now dear you do realize that we were cheetahs are an endangered species.  It would make me very proud to know that my son was the father of the revival of the species." She smiled as she looked at the other girls.</p><p>All of the other girls blushed except for Nair and Vidal as they already had their man. Makoto and Shampoo narrowed their eyes at Mrs. Saotome because there was only so much they'd be willing to give. Ranma of course took this opportunity to quietly slip under the table and pray for a quick death.</p><p>Nodoka seeing that her son was thoroughly embarrassed decided that she'd pushed him enough for now and decided to drop the subject. Besides she'd accomplished her mission by planting the idea in the other girl's heads. The revival of the species was paramount and her son was the key to that happening. She wished that she didn't have to do this to him but survival often made people do things they didn't want to do.</p><p>She just hoped that her son would forgive her for it.</p><p>On their way to school the group was strangely silent. Ukyo had to get back to Nerima and had said goodbye to everybody at the house. There were no monsters attacking to break the tension. The one who spoke first was Makoto.</p><p>"So Ranma what was that party that Auntie was talking about at breakfast?" She asked.</p><p>"I dunno she just said that it was were cats only. Sorry Shampoo but she was pretty adamant about that fact. Guess it's only going to be us cats tonight." Ranma said with a shrug strangely not stuttering when he said cat.</p><p>"Shampoo fine. Want to go to party but great grandmother say Shampoo butt get fat from sitting around." She grumbled a bit.</p><p>"Actually I would like to go to your party tonight." Ami spoke up.</p><p>"But Auntie said it's were cats only and last I checked you don't grow fur or a tail Ami-chan." Makoto said with mock sweetness.</p><p>"Maybe not but I am your goddess. I created your kind and as such I am entitled to a little respect and some privileges." She said with her nose a little higher in the air.</p><p>"Actually it was the you back in the silver millennium that created them. The fact that you are the same soul does not automatically make you their goddess. Besides the fact that you haven't had anything to do with them for centuries... I don't know if that's such a good idea. Well that and the fact that you created them to be your personal servant race..." Rei trailed off as she felt Ami glaring at her.</p><p>"You're just jealous that I'm going to the party and you're not." Ami said with a smug grin as she crossed her arms across her chest.</p><p>"Yeah well..." Rei said as she kicked a rock out of her way.</p><p>"Hey!"  Minako said as she suddenly caught a clue. "You're just going there to get a hunky were cat boyfriend!"</p><p>Ami's resulting blush was all the confirmation that Minako needed.</p><p>"You are! Oooh if Ami's going I'm going too." Minako said as she too crossed her arms across her chest.</p><p>"I'm going too." Rei said. It couldn't hurt to see what was available.</p><p>"Me too." Usagi said then faltered. "Wait a minute I've already got a boyfriend."</p><p>"Hold up. Wait just one minute. Mom said this is a were cat only party!  No humans allowed! What part of that didn't you get? You're not going." Ranma said with as much force as he could to get the point across.</p><p>"But..." Minako started.</p><p>"No buts non humans only! I don't know why, but she usually has a damn good reason for this sort of thing." He sighed. "Tell you what we can have a mixed party later but for tonight you girls can't come."</p><p>"Ok I won't go." Minako said. She then rounded on Makoto. "On one condition." She smiled as Makoto stumbled at their close proximity.</p><p>"No I won't let you sleep with Ranma!" Makoto said. She knew that was what Minako wanted.</p><p>"Too much competition." Minako waved it off. "No what I want is a bio on all the cute unattached guys there. You know name, phone number, picture, length/width/circumference. You know essential details." She paused for a second as all the other girls started blushing at what she just implied. "Oh yes you might as well also include their species." She paused again. "You know that's a question that I never thought I'd have to ask a boyfriend."</p><p>"Fine.  Just as long as you don't come I'll see if I can set you up with some of the guys there." Makoto said while trying to think of some way to get the information without getting hit on herself. She grinned evilly as she remembered that picture of Minako in that string bikini they had her try on as a joke once.</p><p>"Ahh maybe we should continue this after school." Ranma said as they passed through the gates of the school.</p><p>"No need I'm happy as long as I get those bios." Said Minako.</p><p>"Uhh me too." Piped in Rei. "Ah shit this isn't my school!"  She screamed as she tore off towards her school hoping beyond hope that she wouldn't be too late.</p><p>"Well that was fun." Usagi said as the group walked towards their class.</p><p>Ami didn't comment. Since she was still planning on crashing the party tonight. It would be best to make them think she'd agreed to not go so they couldn't hold it against her later. Of course nothing could possibly go wrong.</p><p>Fate of course had just about enough of people poking him with that stick.</p><p>The day passed normally. Well as normally as a day can pass. Setsuna of course ignored her student's bleary eyedbleary-eyed stares and cheerfully taught some gibberish that they would never need. The only one that seemed to be paying attention was Ami.</p><p>In reality Ami was not listening, she was working on her assault plans for tonightstonight's party. Her mother was pressuring her to get a boyfriend. She smiled as she thought of what her mother would think if she brought a were tiger or a were panther home to meet her.  Not to mention the fact that they seemed to have way above average stamina in the sack. She smiled as she remembered watching that video of Ranma, Makoto and Shampoo. If a normal were was only half as good...</p><p>"Ami could you please answer the question on the board." Setsuna called out.</p><p>"46 pi over 3." She responded not even breaking out of her erotic fantasy.</p><p>"Good enough. Alright now..."</p><p>The day passed quickly for most people as each was excited about a different thing that was going to happen that night. Ami, Minako, and Rei were all excited about getting boyfriends of the feline persuasion. Ami of course was going to take a more direct approach to that end.  Makoto and Ranma were eager to find out what a were cat party was like. Usagi was looking forward to a date with Mamorou.</p><p>Luna and Artemis were informed of the party through a text message from Setsuna. They were getting ready for a party that she called 'One of the most unforgettable experiences.'</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen. Children of all ages. Start your engines.</p><p>The final bell was the signal for everybody to rush outside glad that another school day was over. Makoto, Shampoo and Ranma said goodbye to the other girls making sure that they went in the proper direction of their homes before they started off towards their home. On the way Ranma was talking to Shampoo about what kind of training Cologne was going to dream up for her. Ranma of course had a few suggestions about where she could improve. Speed being the highest on his list for obvious reasons.</p><p>They were just rounding the corner to the house when Ranma suddenly stiffened and stopped dead in his tracks. He suddenly spun around scanning the area for a threat that apparently only he could sense. He narrowed his eyes as he tried to pinpoint the source and he slid into a ready combat stance. Makoto and Shampoo seeing him so tense also slipped into combat stances of their own. No words were necessarynecessary, as they understood anything that could make Ranma edgy was a serious threat. Makoto even considered transforming right in the middle of the sidewalk into either Sailor Jupiter or her hybrid form.</p><p>"Hey what are you guys doing?" Artemis said as he jumped onto the fence next to the sidewalk.</p><p>"CAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTT!"  Ranma screamed as he tore off down the street screaming like a little girl.</p><p>"Artemis you idiot! He's still afraid of cats and you go jumping up and nearly getting in his face. Why the hell do you think I stayed down here?" Luna shouted as she too jumped up onto the fence.</p><p>"Ahh I forgot." He said as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.</p><p>"So Makoto are you ready for the party tonight?" Luna said as she not so subtly pushed Artemis off the fence.</p><p>"Does everybody know about that!that? What is there a big sign saying party at our place tonight!" Makoto hissed.</p><p>"Ahh no Setsuna told us about it." Luna said with a shrug.</p><p>"What part of no humans allowed..." Luna glared at her. "Ahh just try not to get eaten ok." Makoto managed to stumble out.</p><p>"If talking kitty goes Shampoo go too." Shampoo stated.</p><p>"Shampoo you are human. Even with your curse. Besides I don't think your great grandmother would let you. Remember she's got some kind of training for you tonight." Makoto said as she laid her hand on Shampoo's shoulder.</p><p>"Fine.  We party later. Airen 2 must tell Shampoo how party went though or Shampoo be angry with." Shampoo said playfully as she put Makoto into a headlock and ruffled her hair.</p><p>"All right, all right already. I'll give you a play by play tomorrow ok?"  Makoto said as she tried unsuccessfully to get out of the headlock.</p><p>Shampoo let go and stepped back. She turned and started walking again towards the Saotome home. She waved at them before taking off towards the Saotome mansion as well.</p><p>"Well I guess that just leaves us." Makoto said as she picked up Artemis and put him over her left shoulder. She then motioned for Luna to jump onto her right shoulder. When she was sure both cats were secure she continued on her way too.</p><p>Once she arrived she noticed a few things were different. For one there were quite a few cars in the yard. Some of them were parked in the driveway, some were parked on the lawn, and the helicopter was parked on the roof. She saw a few lions and tigers sunbathing on the back deck. She thankfully resisted the urge to say 'Oh my'. Feeling more at home she decided to shift to her hybrid form. Luna and Artemis decided that this was their stop and jumped off her shoulders and went inside. She stretched out thankful that the tear zones did their thing.</p><p>The lions and tigers that were sunbathing lifted their heads to see what the tearing sound was. Makoto decided to do a bit of subtle posing.  Look but don't touch. She saw two of the tigers duck behind the house. She slowly walked towards the house allowing them plenty of time to put some clothes on. Sure enough just as she was about to get to the door one of them came tearing around the corner tugging his pants on with one hand and buttoning his shirt with the other.  She noticed that the clothes were designed to fit his hybrid form.</p><p>And what a hybrid form it was. He was packed with lots of muscles and boy was he tall. If she guessed correctly he was nearing eight feet.  He didn't exactly tower over her but she did have to look up when he got near her. His features were similar to the other were cats she'd met (Walter), the only difference was that his fur was orange and black along his back and white along his stomach. If she wasn'tweren't taken already she'd find him attractive. Ok fine she found him attractive but it wasn't like she was going to dump Ranma and just jump this guy. Deciding to be friendly she started taking notes for the other girls.</p><p>"Hey there. I guess you're here for the party." She said as she put on a smile.</p><p>"Uhh yeah. I didn't know there was another female were cheetah running around. Uh heh hehe." He started stuttering like Ryoga when he got around a pretty girl.</p><p>Makoto noticed that the words she was hearing didn't match the way his mouth was moving. She noticed that he had a pendant around his neck. She didn't know how she knew it, but she knew the pendant was magical.</p><p>"Knock it off Bob." The second were tiger said as he smacked the first one upside the head.</p><p>The second one was around seven feet. He was just a bit taller than Makoto herself. Unlike the first one this one was lean with whipcord muscles. She couldn't tell if he was an out of shape were tiger as she didn't really have any other examples to compare him to. Also unlike the first one he didn't bother putting on a shirt so Makoto could see pretty much everything. She wished she had her camera here as Minako wanted a picture as well as a bio. Oh well there was time enough for that later. Time to schmooze.</p><p>"Actually until a few weeks ago I didn't even know I was a were cheetah myself either. Oh by the way my name's Makoto Kino nice to meet you."  She bowed.</p><p>"I'm Jim age sixteen, smwt." He smiled hoping to show as much charm as he could.</p><p>"Umm smwt?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"Single Male Were Tiger." He said with a roguish grin. Add fur and a whole bunch of height and he would have looked like her old boyfriend.</p><p>Her old boyfriend who was nothing but a player and dumped her on her ass when something better came along.</p><p>"Engaged Female Were Cheetah." She said with a little more force than was necessary.</p><p>"Ahh but you're not wearing a ring." Jim tried.</p><p>"In Japan there is a tradition of arranged marriages. Even though I'm not wearing a ring does not mean that I'm not engaged. Tell you what I'll introduce you to my fiancées." She smiled an impish grin. Shampoo wouldn't impress them too much unless she was decked out in her silvered gear. Ranma however could probably take the two of them easily.</p><p>"Uhh sure. That wouldn't happen to be the guy that came in here screaming like a little girl about evil cats would it?" Jim asked.</p><p>Makoto put her hand to her face and grimaced.</p><p>"Yeah that would be one of them. His name is Ranma."</p><p>"One of them?" Bob asked blushing like crazy.</p><p>"Yeah Ranma defeated this human her name's Shampoo. By her peoples laws that is a marriage proposal or something like that. She's not that bad and I kinda like her." Makoto said leaving out all the other stuff.</p><p>"Lucky guy." Jim muttered.</p><p>"Yes he is." Makoto replied just as the door to the house opened.</p><p>Shampoo walked out with her great grandmother trailing her. Jim and Bob were acting nervous. Shampoo was decked out in a dark royal purple cheongsam that went down to about mid thigh on her. Across her chest was a hardened leather breastplate. The breastplate had a spiral symbol carved into the middle of it and it also had some nicks and scratches from where Shampoo couldn't dodge fast enough and the breastplate had to perform its function of keeping her internals internal. Her shins had splinted leather shin guards to protect from low blows. Her forearms were protected by hardened leather bracers with metal studs in them.</p><p>Even though you couldn't see any exposed weapons because of her hidden weapons technique; to their were senses she was practically reeking with silver hence the were tigers skittishness.</p><p>Cologne was dressed in her normal green robe and was bouncing around behind Shampoo on her walking stick. Makoto couldn't detect any silver on her but she still knew that the old woman was still the more dangerous of the two.</p><p>"Hey Shampoo heading out already?" Makoto said as she sidled up to her... co-wife? Fiancée? She made a mental note to try and figure out their relationship later.</p><p>"Mmm Hmm Great Grandma says she going to teach Shampoo new move. She say Shampoo fall behind airens and need to catch up." She smiled as she pulled out a small silvered dagger and started flipping it around and catching it.</p><p>"Yeah right. If I couldn't transform you'd wipe the floor with me every time." Makoto joked.</p><p>"Shampoo agree. But Shampoo need learn this because Ranma so far ahead and now much farther than Shampoo. Shampoo no mind, great grandmother no teach me stuff for long time. I is happy to learn." 'From the old slave driving old witch' Shampoo thought.</p><p>"Well have fun." Makoto said as she leaned over and gave Shampoo a quick kiss on the lips.</p><p>Shampoo was so stunned that she froze for a couple of seconds and therefore missed catching her dagger. It clattered to the ground and skidded over to where the two brothers were standing. Both of them screamed and jumped away from the implement. Both of them had silver burns before and were not eager to repeat the experience any time soon.</p><p>"Get that away from me!" Yelled Jim as he cowered behind Bob.</p><p>"It's just silver what are you so afraid of?" Makoto asked as she bent down to pick up the dagger off the ground and return it to Shampoo.</p><p>Her hand was smacked away by Colognes staff right before she wound up and smacked Makoto herself flinging her about five meters away. Makoto crumpled into a heap as she felt her strained ribs and the bruise caused by the hit start to heal.</p><p>"That would be very unwise daughter in law." Cologne started.  "You've been protected by the locking potion most of your life and as such have never felt what silver can do to your kind."  Cologne paused to make sure that Makoto was listening. "As I'm told it feels like putting your hand over the fire but the burning doesn't stop even when you take your hand away."</p><p>"Y... Yeah that's pretty much right." Stuttered Bob. "It really really hurts. You don't want to feel that."</p><p>"Ahh ok." Truth be told she didn't think it would be that bad but if Cologne said it was...</p><p>Ahh curiosity and the cat.</p><p>"Anyway Shampoo pickup your dagger and let's get going. I've got a lot to teach you before tomorrow." And with how stupid her great granddaughter had been acting she doubted that she'd pick up the technique tonight. Ranma on the other hand would probably get it in fifteen minutes tops.</p><p>Shampoo collected her dagger and stowed it away along with the rest of her equipment. She then walked over to where Makoto was still sitting on the ground waiting to heal up. She then proceeded to do an oral cavity search of her other intended with her tongue.</p><p>Once she was finished Makoto's tail was sticking straight out and was ridged as a steel rod and her hair all over her body was sticking straight up. In a comical sense she looked like a big puffball with convenient carrying stick.</p><p>"Got back airen." Shampoo giggled as she sauntered out the gate her great grandmother trailing her.</p><p>"Daaaamn."  Jim said as the last scene finally sunk into his skull.</p><p>"..." Bob said as he was laying on the ground blood fountaining from his nose in spurts.</p><p>It took a whole five minutes for Makoto to compose herself enough to stand on her feet without falling over. As she stood on shaky legs a female cheetah wearing Ranma's shirt came barreling out of the house. The cheetah immediately rushed over and started rubbing itself against her legs while purring up a storm.</p><p>"There's another one!" Jim shouted. "Just how many were cheetahs are there!"</p><p>"Down Ranma." Makoto said as she tried to pry the purring cheetah away from her legs so that she could get mobile again.</p><p>"Wait a minute wasn't your other fiancee a guy?" Jim asked as he checked again. Yup female.</p><p>"Long story." Makoto grumbled as she bent down and started petting her crazy fiancee.</p><p>"Ok so why's she acting like a cat? Far as I know that shouldn't happen." Jim said as he checked again. Still female.</p><p>"Another long story." She said as she picked Ranma off of the ground and tossed the still purring cat over her shoulder.</p><p>"Look I've got to go take care of this. I'll see you guys later tonight Ok?" She said as she waved her hand at them as she walked away.</p><p>"Ahh sure." Jim said as he waved at her.</p><p>Once Makoto had closed the door behind her Jim turned to Bob. Bob was still lying on the ground with a silly grin on his face.</p><p>"What's gotten into you?" Jim asked knowing his brothersbrother's tolerance for females was exceedingly low.</p><p>"Pantiessssss."  Bob said as his silly grin got wider.</p><p>"No way! You really got to see them."</p><p>Bob's only response was another fountain of blood similar to those synchronized fountains.</p><p>Once she had gotten into the house she noticed several of the adults milling around the foyer and living room. There was an older lion talking to what looked like a leopard. (she'dShe'd taken an interest in the different species of the great cats after finding out she was one of them) A stately tigress was watching a younger tigress play Bone Crusher against a younger snow leopard.</p><p>Makoto resolved herself to finding out who these people were later. For now she had to get Ranma male again and snap him out of the Neko ken.  Fortunately after the Kasumi incident he told her the quickest way to snap him out was to trigger the curse.</p><p>Killing two birds with one stone in a bush or something like that.</p><p>Once she got to the bathroom she opened the door to find Nodoka soaking in the pool/furo with a were panther. The surrealness of the situation made her pause at the entryway. She slowly backed out as Mrs. Saotome leaned over and started lightly biting the neck of the panther. The kitchen sink would be good enough.</p><p>Makoto shook her head to try and get rid of the image of Mrs. Saotome cheating on her husband. She then remembered what an asshole her husband was and everything was ok again.</p><p>The kitchen was not as busy as the other areas of the house. Still there was an older male jaguar talking to a younger panther. The older jaguar looked up and nodded towards Makoto before going back to his conversation. Oh well first things first. She put Ranma down on the floor. He was looking up at her with his big blue eyes. His tail swishing back and forth in a random pattern. His forepaws were tucked in under his body and his hind legs were tucked in as well.</p><p>He looked bloody cute like that. Makoto briefly entertained the thought of a trained animal modeling career. Or maybe even a movie career. Just thinking about the money they could make.</p><p>Oh wait that's right the whole ruling the planet thing was going to happen.</p><p>Back to Ranma. Makoto walked over to the cupboard and pulled out a glass.  She then went over to the sink and turned on the hot water. She waited a bit for the water to heat up then she filled the glass.</p><p>"Ok Ranma time to uncrazy." She said as she tossed the water.</p><p>Right onto the floor as Ranma dodged.</p><p>"Mrow."  Ranma said looking cuter than a truck full of bunnies.</p><p>"Come on Ranma I don't have time for this." She said in an exasperated tone as she once again filled the glass and tossed it.</p><p>Now if only Ranma could dodge water this well when he wasn't off his tree.</p><p>By this time the were jaguar and panther had noticed something was wrong and had stopped their conversation and were looking at Makoto as she struggled to get the other cheetah wet for some reason. They looked at each other before getting up in unison.</p><p>"Can I possibly help with whatever you're doing?." The old jaguar asked.</p><p>"Ahh yeah could you get ready to turn on the hot water in the sink?"  Makoto asked as she prepared to tackle Ranma. He was getting wet one way or another.</p><p>"Can I at least ask as to why you want to get her wet? I can tell she's a were cheetah like yourself although I don't know Brittany was coming."</p><p>Makoto wasn't paying attention as she was staring at Ranma trying to determine which direction he was going to bolt to and if he in his primitive instinct driven mind he even suspected her master plan.</p><p>"I'll explain later just get ready." She said tensing.</p><p>"Can I do anything?" The panther asked.</p><p>"Catch him if I miss." Makoto said as she pounced.</p><p>Ranma dodged to the left thinking his mate was still wanting to play tag.  He was so intent on her that he missed the were panther that snuck up behind him. Once he was pinned he started to thrash to try and get loose. He almost did get free a couple of times but his mate jumped in and helped the other male hold him down. He started growling as they picked him up and started carrying him towards the small hard puddle thing.</p><p>"Turn it on NOW!" Makoto shouted as she grabbed Ranma fully and rushed towards the sink.</p><p>As soon as he hit the water he changed into a male. He thrashed around for another thirty seconds getting Makoto completely soaked and throwing water all over the counter and the floor. The jaguar and panther had enough sense to clear the area as soon as the crazy were cheetah girl had grabbed the other crazy cheetah girl and tossed her into the sink. It took a bit but eventually Ranma shook his head and looked up at Makoto with an enquiring gaze as if to ask 'why the hell am I in the sink?'</p><p>"I'll explain later." Makoto said as she turned off the water.</p><p>Turning to the two other men in the room she bowed.</p><p>"Thank you for your help. I'm Kino Makoto and this is my fiancee Ranma."  She said indicating the now male Ranma.</p><p>"But... But he was a she. I'm certain of that!" The panther was freaking out.</p><p>"Yeah he kinda has a jusenkyo curse. Cold water turns him female, hot water turns him back." She said a little embarrassed about revealing her boyfriend's secret to total strangers.</p><p>"Ahh Jusenkyo that makes sense now. No what I want to know was why he was acting like a real cat earlier." The panther said before realizing something. "Forgive me. I forgot that you introduced yourself. My name is Gino, leader of the were jaguars on earth."  He bowed.</p><p>"Ahh yeah... my names Teros." The panther said shyly as he adverted his eyes from Makoto's form clinging shirt.</p><p>"It's a long story and I don't think I should be the one to tell it."  Makoto said covering her chest as she realized exactly how clingy it had gotten.</p><p>"Umm if you'll excuse me we've got to get dried off and changed."  Makoto said as she started inching towards the door.</p><p>"Of course. The party hasn't really started yet. I recommend though that you get dressed in clothes that will fit you properly, although I do commend your ingenuity at modifying those normal clothes to fit your hybrid form." Gino said as he turned and grabbed Teros and dragged him back to the table.</p><p>Makoto fled the room with Ranma nipping on her heels. Once sufficient time had elapsed Gino turned to Teros and said.</p><p>"I fear for the species."</p><p>Once they had reached the safety of their room Ranma shifted back to his hybrid form. Makoto stripped off her wet clothes and went over to the closet.</p><p>"So what the hell ? I rrrrememberrrr rrrunning from</p><p>Arrrtemis.."  he grumbled at this. "then I get herrre and therrre's cats all overrr the place and then... blank." Ranma said as he toweled off then put on his extra large silk shirt.</p><p>"You were in the neko ken when I got here. I figured the easiest way to snap you out of it would be to activate the curse." Makoto said as she slipped on one of her specially made bras. "Also you were female for some reason."</p><p>"I don't rrrememberrr changing. Maybe I spilled somebody's drrrink orrr something. Why didn't you just thrrrow me into the bath?"  Ranma asked as he pulled on his pants.</p><p>"Umm the bath was uhh occupied. I thought of just throwing some hot water on you from the sink but you wanted to play dodge the water instead."  Makoto said as she smacked him in the back of his head. "Eventually I just got fed up and dropped your ass in the sink and let the water go."</p><p>"Umm sorrrry about that." Ranma said as he hung his head.</p><p>He knew that he got a little catty when he was under the influence of the Neko ken but it was never this bad.</p><p>"So who werrre those guys in the kitchen?" Ranma asked curious as to who the other guests were.</p><p>"Well the older jaguar was Gino, he's the leader of the were jaguars. The younger one was Teros he's a were panther. Other than the fact that Gino knew about Jusenkyo, I don't know much else about them."  Makoto said as she finally turned to look at him.</p><p>"Hey do you think he might know a currre?" Ranma said as he thought of never turning into a girl again.</p><p>"I don't think so. He just seemed familiar with it. Besides..." She said as she sauntered up to where he was standing and leaned in close. "I don't really mind your girl form at all." She finished her statement by licking his nose.</p><p>"Ahhh."  Ranma expressed as his mind wandered back to his first screaming female orgasm under the ministrations of said tongue.</p><p>"I guess it's not so bad." He stuttered as the memory hit the switch in his brain which until recently hadn't been used. Libido on.</p><p>Makoto could practically smell the pheromones leaking off him. She had to fight her own rising arousal.</p><p>"Not now we've got to get back downstairs. Party now rut later."  Makoto said as she grabbed the front of his shirt and pulled him out of the room.</p><p>Authors Note</p><p>This chapter was getting a bit too big for it's own good so I decided to split it into two chapters. In other notes I will be continuing Dragon's bane. I was quite overwhelmed by the response (over 25 reviews and still comming my god I didn't know that there were that many people that actually read my stuff.)</p><p>What's next?</p><p>Lunocracy</p><p>Fast Tracks</p><p>Cat's Tale</p><p>Dragons Bane</p><p>Honestly I have no idea. I think I'll roll a d4 and let it</p><p>This work of fanfiction is brought to you by my prereaders</p><p>Lord Raa, Axekeeper, Chi Vayne, and KM</p><p>and ethel alchohol, providing much needed reality altering experiences since the bronze age.</p>
