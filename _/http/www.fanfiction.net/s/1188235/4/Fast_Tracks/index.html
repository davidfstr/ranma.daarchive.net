</div>Di s claim er- We don't own this. We don't claim to own this, not ours.<p>Now on with the show.<p>Chapter 4: Nice to meet you again.<p>The next morning dawned bright and early, the sky was clear and it was looking to be a great day. The birds were singing in the trees and the dew on the grass looked like diamonds hanging off of jade rods. For our two lost kitties it would be the start of a wonderful day.<p>Ranma was the first to stir. The first thing he noticed was that he was a she. Durring the night the condensation must have been enough to trigger the change. She was smaller in some places, and larger in two others. She gave a sigh which caused her shirt to rip just a bit more. She winced at this. Her mother was going to kill her. She wondered how Makoto's clothes survived the transformation. Wait a minute... Makoto. Ranma held her breath as she felt something snuggle against her front. She gulped and looked down right into the sleeping face of her fiancee. Granted Makoto was still a cheetah at the time but Ranma wasn't used to sleeping this closely with anybody. She jumped up and dashed over to the edge of the clearing.<p>Makoto was rudely awakened when her heat source suddenly disappeared. She blinked a few times trying to get her berrings. She appeared to be in a wooded clearing. Racking her muddled brain for any information she managed to remember running away from her homicidal friends, Ranma chasing her, and finally going to sleep curled up to his rock hard chest. She shook her head to clear it and got up and stretched activating her transformation as she did so. As her body stretched and shifted back to her hybrid form. She was in the middle of her stretch when she was disturbed by a noise off to the side. She turned to see Ranma in female hybrid form staring at her. A small trickle of blood was leaking from her nose.<p>That was the time that a small gust of wind rustled the fur on her breast. It was then that her sleep fogged brain finally grinded in to gear.<p>"You pervert! I hope you like what your seeing!" She yelled while bringing her arms down to cover herself.<p>Ranma gave off a strangled squeek and spun around. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."<p>Makoto huffed and went to put on her clothes. When she was properly dressed she turned back to where Ranma was cowering like he expected something or someone to hit him. Makoto was a little disturbed by this. What had happened to him?<p>"Ranma?" She asked hesitantly. "You can turn around now I'm not going to hit you."<p>"You're not? But everytime I've seen a girl naked they've hit me. Akane sure hit me enough times." He rubbed his head as if trying to soothe an imaginary mallet strike.<p>Makoto looked down. "Who was this Akane. You mentioned her before but I guess there was so much else happening that I never thought to ask about her." She leaned forward and put her hands on her hips. She had to rebalance herself quickly so that she wouldn't fall face first into the grass. "So who was this girl that let you sleep in her lap?"<p>Ranma started sweating, he really didn't want to bring up Akane... ever.<p>"Well. I'm waiting." Ok so he was nervous. It couldn't be the Neko ken since he was in his hybrid form right now so it had to be Akane. "I could just ask Aunty or maybe even Shampoo you know."<p>"Alright, Alright I'll tell you. It all started about a year ago when the old man and I first came to Nerima..." He then proceeded to tell her about all of the fiancee's and crazy's after his hide and a brief overview of the story so far. Sufficed to say after he was finished Makoto was stunned. If she hadn't sat down at the beginning she would have facefaulted so hard that her whole head would have been burried in the ground.<p>"You've got to be kidding me. She hit you just for that!" Makoto couldn't believe that she would hit him just for hanging out with his (apparently only) friend.<p>"Yeah sometimes she just hit me when she thought I did something." He remembered all the times she would hit him just for the hell of it.<p>Makoto thought about this for a bit and then came to a conclusion.<p>"You know you never did answer my question."<p>"Uhh what question was that again?" He couldn't remember her asking him anything except for... Oh hell.<p>"Did you like the view? You know when I was naked." She blushed so hard that he actually could make it out through her fur.<p>"Umm well..." He started to say.<p>"If you know what's good for you you'll say yes."<p>"Yes oh yes." This was different. She was smiling. Did that mean that she like him seeing her naked or did she like that he liked seeing her naked. He was sooo confused. It was easier when they just hit him.<p>Makoto felt a lot better and she had no idea why. Sure hearing Ranma say that he liked to see her naked made her feel good. Usually when a guy propositioned her she kicked the crap out of him. However when Ranma said that she felt different, proud of her body. It was like his opinion of her mattered... but that was supposed to only happen with those you cared about.<p>"Don't tell me I've fallen for the idiot already." She mumbled under her breath.<p>Unfortunately she forgot that with the transformation came improved hearing. Ranma was currently blushing to her roots. Not that Makoto could see this of course. She just had to needle him a bit.<p>"Well since you saw me naked let's see you strip." She'd meant it as a joke of course. She never expected him to actually ...<p>Strip totally buck naked and stand infront of her.<p>"Don't you have any feminine modesty?" She was flaberghasted that he would just strip like that. She wondered if she'd do it when she was a he.<p>"Uhh no I'm a guy remember, besides we've got the same parts right now so it's all right... right?"<p>Makoto was thinking about that when the sun rose over the top of the trees and bathed her in it's warm glow. She marvled at how the warm sun felt on her fur. She just wanted to curl up and go back to sleep letting it's golden radience lull her into a deep slumber.<p>Wait a minute if the sun was that high then...<p>"Fuck we're late for school!" Makoto shouted before tearing out of the clearing leaving Ranma to put on her clothes.<p>"Wonder how long it's going to take her to remember that we're lost." Ranma said to herself as she carefully put on her clothes trying not to rip it further.<p>About 2 minutes later Makoto came back into the clearing to see Ranma fully (if indecently) dressed with her arms crossed underneath her breasts. Her tail was lashing back and forth.<p>"Took you long enough to remember we're still lost."<p>"Why the hell didn't you stop me or tell me or something!" Ok so he was a jerk.<p>"Well you just ran out of here while I was still naked. Now running around as a were cheetah is bad, running around as a naked female were cheetah is a lot worse." Ranma said like Makoto should already have thought of that.<p>"Alright so how do we get back?"<p>"Easy." Ranma said as she stretched out a bit. "We just follow the tracks back to Tokyo."<p>Makoto slapped her forehead. The answer was right infront of her. She wondered how long it was going to take them to get back.<p>Ranma slapped Makoto on her shoulder.<p>"Tag you're it! Race you back." She yelled while running out of the clearing.<p>Makoto smiled and chased after him laughing as well.<p>As soon as she exited the trees she saw Ranma running alongside the tracks. She wondered if they were going to race the train again. She looked up to see Ranma starting to pull away as she accelerated. She poured on the speed to try and catch up. She was having a great time a lot better than she'd had in years.<p>Ranma's clothes were ripped and torn from her shifting to her hybrid form. It was a general miracle that they didn't come appart when she was chasing Makoto before. Miracles end however as she hit the sound barrier the rips and tears suddenly became larger, much larger. Her shirt was first as it tore free of her torso and quickly decelerated. That was one of her favorite red silk shirts too. Damn she was hoping that her mom would be able to fix it. She was so shocked that she almost tripped when her pants came off next leaving her running along in her boxer shorts. She started to slow down allowing Makoto to catch up.<p>Makoto was trying her best not to laugh and failing miserably.<p>"He he. What was that you said about not wanting to run naked?"<p>"Don't laugh it could be you running naked you know." Ranma was getting steamed.<p>"But it's just so funny..." She couldn't hold it in any longer, she broke down lauging her ass off.<p>"Alright you asked for it." Ranma said as she pounced ontop of Makoto. They rolled around on the ground Makoto's uniform aquiring several new ripps and tears. At the end of their impromptu fight/tickle fest Makoto's uniform was pretty much trashed.<p>"My uniform! Oh man this was my last one too!" Now she'd have to run naked like Ranma. She turned to where Ranma was but found that she wasn't there. She looked down and saw Ranma in her full cheetah form cleaning herself and looking smug.<p>"You planned this from the start didn't you?" Ohh he was going to pay for this.<p>"Rawr ror."<p>"So you want to run as a cheetah do you now?" Ok two could play at this game. She tore off all of her clothes leaving her completely naked for a couple of seconds it took for her to shift to her cat mode.<p>She ran right over Ranma and took off along the tracks back to Tokyo. Ranma was so stunned at seeing her naked again that it took a good two minutes before she noticed that Makoto had already left and had gotten a really good head start.<p>Ranma shook her head as she took off hoping to catch up to her without having to resort to supersonic speeds.<p>Rewind time, shift scene.<p>It was morning in the Tsukino household. Mrs Tsukino was in the kitchen finishing up breakfast. Her husband was at the table reading the morning paper. Shingo was taking a bath, Chibi Usa was downstairs watching tv, and Usagi was still sleeping like a corpse.<p>Quickly glancing at the clock on the wall she noted that if she didn't wake up right now Usagi would be late for school again. She sighed and wondered about her daughter sometimes. For someone who was sixteen years old she acted like she was five sometimes. She acended the stairs and went to her daughters room. She didn't bother knocking on the door and just went in. Luna was there shouting as loud as she dared trying to wake Usagi up. Mrs. Tsukino had known for a long time about Luna and her ability to talk, and about her daughter being sailor moon. A mother just knows these things about her children. Well that and the walls were thin and both Luna and Usagi had a tendancy to talk in their sleep.<p>"So Luna are you having trouble waking her up again?"<p>"Mrowr." Luna said in return.<p>"You know Luna you and I are going to have to have a talk one of these days." She said as she walked over to her daughter's bed. "Ok off." She said as she grabbed the far sheets. Luna jumped off the bed already knowing what she was going to do as it seemed to be the only way to wake up her charge.<p>She quickly flipped the sheets spilling the still sleeping Usagi onto the floor and incidentally making the bed at the same time. As soon as her head hit the floor Usagi was awake.<p>"Oh Mamo chan! Wait what am I doing here?"<p>"Being late for school that's what. Breakfast is ready."<p>"I'm going to be late! Why didn't you wake me earlier?" She yelled at Luna.<p>Mrs. Tsukino went downstairs and served up breakfast. Usagi as usual ran downstairs scarfed down enough for two people and took off running out the door. Chibi Usa, Shingo, and Mr. Tsukino left shortly after. Luna and Mrs. Tsukino were the only two left in the house.<p>"Alright Luna let's talk."<p>"Mrowor."<p>"You talk in your sleep kitty cat now spill it."<p>"Fuck."<p>"That's a good start. Now lets talk about my daughter being a princess shall we."<p>In another part of town another blond was getting ready for the day. Artemis was lamenting his fate. No sex for a month. Oh and that cute persian Kikyo from down the street was in heat again. He was in hell.<p>"I hope you learn your lesson." Minako was still lecturing him.<p>"But Minako it wasn't my fault she was putting off umm pheramones yeah that's right. I couldn't help myself."<p>"So you just had to go and screw my best friend's leg. Sorry not buying it."<p>"But..."<p>"Your grounded remember end of story."<p>"Fine." Maybe if he couldn't go out he could get them to come to him. He the white stud rides again.<p>Minako ate her breakfast quckly but not as fast as Usagi. She then saw that she only had ten minutes to get to school she panicked and ran off at top speed towards school.<p>Changing scene yet again we arrive at the Hiakawa shrine. Rei is late this morning because her grandfather had her clean up the storage room and fix the door. She finished around two in the morining. She couldn't really blame Makoto for the door as they were trying to kill her. She still winced at that.<p>She would have to do something to try and make it up to her. Maybe bake her some cookies or something.<p>'Sorry we tried to kill you here's some cookies.'<p>Yeah like that would really work. She sighed as she ate her toast on the way to school. Hopefully Makoto would come back and they could at least try to fix things. She didn't want to lose Makoto as a friend.<p>Yet another change of scene.<p>Nothing different was happening at the Mizuno household so let's just move on.<p>At the Saotome household Shampoo was up and sparring with her great-grandmother while Nodoka was making breakfast. Last night when she came home she told them all about what had happened at the shrine and what the older scout told her about Ranma and Makoto. She of course left out the part about the pen. She didn't know what to think about it and wanted to talk to Makoto before she told anybody else.<p>Ranma's mother was estatic. Her son was so manly! She was so giddy that when Shampoo asked if she could sleep with Ranma Nodoka gave her blessing without hesitation even going so far as to ignore the rules that she set out yesterday.<p>Right now Shampoo was just winding down from a particularly hectic sparring with her great-grandmother. The old bat was pushing her harder than she ever had before. True she had slacked off in her training a bit since she came to Nerima but she was still in top form and constantly fighting with Akane, Ukyo, and Kodachi had only helped to increase her skills farther.<p>"Shampoo it has come to my attention recently that I have been negligent in your training. I fear that with all the excitement I have neglected my duties as your teacher." She reached into her robes and pulled out a bag of sweet chestnuts. "I fully intend to make up for my errors starting now."<p>"Breakfast is ready everyone!" Nodoka called from the kitchen.<p>"I fully intend to make up for my errors starting after school today. Now let's go eat." She said as she pogoed off towards the house.<p>Shampoo had to peel her face off the ground from her facefault. Cologne used to make her train right through meals now... she looked towards the house. Had the elder gone soft living in Japan with all it's modern conveniences or did she have some alternative motive? The elders always had something up their sleeves. Personally she hoped that she died a heroic death rather than grow old and become an elder herself.<p>She trecked off towards the house to get cleaned up, eat breakfast and get off to school. Stupid school she'd get it someday. She smiled a cruel smile. A few well placed breaking points would have it reduced to rubble in no time at all.<p>The rest of the morning passed uneventfully, well except for her food mysteriously disappearing. She looked at her grandmother strangely. Was she trying to duplicate the fat bastard's training? She hoped not. Trying to learn the neko ken in her condition would be umm bad.<p>"Shampoo if you don't leave now you'll be late." Cologne said calmly while sipping her tea.<p>Shampoo choked down the rest of her food, grabbed her bag and dashed out of the door and took to the roofs so that she could go faster her skirt billowing out giving everybody who was underneath and just happened to be looking up a really good panty shot.<p>Back at the Saotome household.<p>"You know that was really mean of you setting the clock ahead 15 minutes like that." Walter said as he reset the clock back to the proper time.<p>"Her ass has been getting too big sitting around here doing nothing. I just thought she could use the exercise." She said before getting up and wandering over to where Nodoka was cleaning up. "Here let me do that, you've got to get to work now don't you?"<p>"How did you...?"<p>"I'm old we just know these things. That and I saw the reports on the table."<p>"Alright then I'm off." She grabbed her briefcase and stepped out the door.<p>Cologne turned to where Walter was wiping down the table. Under her breath she muttered. "So it's just you and me today sonny. He he now to cause some havok." Louder she said. "I'll go do the dishes and clean up the kitchen. Don't worry about lunch I've got to go out later to run some errands."<p>"Alright. According to Shampoo Ranma and Makoto should be back sometime today. Are you going to be long?"<p>"Possibly. I wouldn't worry too much about those two. This is just a chance for them to get to know eachother better. It'll do them some good."<p>"I guess you're right. They do make a good couple."<p>"You mean triple. Shampoo is in there too. If they all work together this will be one interesting marriage." She cackled as she pogoed off.<p>Walter stood there for a few moments and then shuddered. It felt like somebody was tapdancing on his grave wearing steeltoed combat boots.<p>As it turns out Shampoo was early to school. She was sitting in her seat cursing her ancestors. Well the living ones at least. Ami came in next reading another one of her books. She glanced briefly at Shampoo and dismissed her as a threat and went back to reading her book. Shampoo seriously thought about screwing with her head but thought better of it as they were supposed to be her friends now.<p>Slowly the rest of the students trickled into the classroom. The noise level slowly rose as more and more students entered the classroom. Shampoo ignored all of them. Strange multi coloured skirt, and orange skirt hadn't gotten to class yet and she didn't think that red skirt went to this school. She was looking around for Ranma and Makoto but couldn't see them.<p>There was a disturbance at the front of the classroom. Shampoo was the only one who turned to look. She saw multi coloured skirt and orange skirt come tumbling into the class just ahead of the teacher.<p>Ms. Haruna waited until Usagi and Minako got to their seats.<p>"Alright roll call..." She then proceeded to call out the names and the corresponding student responded. "...Kino Makoto... Makoto. Ok she's absent." She scanned the classroom. "It also appears that Mr. Saotome is also absent." She marked both of them off on the attendance and continued on.<p>Class proceeded normally like it did the day before. The teachers tried to teach, the students tried to stay awake and everybody was wishing that time would mysteriously speed up.<p>Shampoo was just starting to nod off durring her history. She would have to appologize to Ranma about teasing him for falling asleep in class. She was suddenly jolted awake by a loud crash from the courtyard and screaming of terrified students. Ms Haruna gave an exagagerated sigh.<p>"All right everybody just sit down. The monster will rampage for a bit and the sailor scouts will show up and kill it then we can ge back to class." She stood with her arms crossed. Usagi, Minako and Ami were fidgeting in their seats.<p>Two minutes passed and still no stupid speaches. The crashing could still be heard and people in the background could be heard screaming.<p>"Oh god somebody please help us."<p>"Arg!"<p>"Raaar."<p>Crash Bang smash oh you get the idea.<p>Shampoo who'd had enough of this raised her hand. Ms. Haruna acknowledged her.<p>"Can Shampoo be excused go save world?"<p>"Shampoo please try again and remember your pronouns."<p>Shampoo scrunched up her face.<p>"Can I please be excused so that I can go save the world."<p>"That's better but no. What do you think this is the Power Puff girls?"<p>Shampoo was banging her head against her desk. No wonder Ranma did this so often it was oddly theraputic.<p>"Shampoo go kill monster be back in second." She said as she pulled her favorite Tai Chi sword from subspace, ran over to the window, and jumped out.<p>The entire class ran over to the windows to see if she had become one with the pavement. What they saw was Shampoo going hand to hand with the monster and trashing it.<p>Usagi, Minako, and Ami took this opportunity to slip out of the classroom to go change.<p>Up in the classroom it may have looked like Shampoo was giving the monster what for, but down on the ground it was a different story. The monster was slow so she had no problems evading it's clumsy strikes, it probably had magic resistance since her sword was doing damage to it. The biggest problem Shampoo found was that it had regeneration. No matter what she tried she just couldn't seem to do enough damage to it so that it couldn't heal. Hell she'd tried cutting it's arms, legs and head off three times already but they just grew back a few seconds later.<p>Shampoo was getting frustrated.<p>"Hold! Schools are for sleeping. For interupting many student's well earned rest... I shall punish you." Sailor Moon said while making stupid gestures. Shampoo wondered if the first thing that she should teach them was how to NOT give away the element of surprise. She looked briefly at what were supposed to be her new allies. Oh did she have a lot of work ahead of her.<p>While Sailor Moon was off doing her stupid speach and poses, Mercury was scanning the monster. She'd learned her lesson and would make sure they didn't make the same mistake twice.<p>"It's got tons of magic resistance and it can regenerate." She looked at her screen again before putting her computer away. "We're going to have to do a lot of damage to it to kill it."<p>"Are you pondering what I'm pondering?" Minako said.<p>Mercury gave an evil grin. "Quite. Let's do it."<p>Moon had a perplexed look on her face. "Um I rarely know what you're thinking."<p>Venus and Mercury resisted the facefault.<p>"Our new weapons!"<p>Moon blanched. She didn't want to be caught dead using her weapon.<p>"No, no way. I am not going to do it. I'll just stand over here for a while."<p>"Suit yourself." Minako said. She then reached into her subspace pocket and pulled out her weapon.<p>"Venus Love Me Chainsaw."<p>BRAPPPP PP PPP PPP<p>-<p>Venus Love me Chainsaw:<p>Husqvarna 10 horse logging chainsaw<p>Blade length 5 feet<p>Self oiling titanium carbide chain<p>Turbo feature for those particularly tough spots.<p>Harts painted all along the blade<p>+1 enchantment<p>-<p>Minako was giggling like a mad woman as she charged the monster. Shampoo having some sense got the hell out of the way of the crazy woman. Just before she got to the monster she jumped into the air and hit the turbo button. The chainsaw screamed as the chain speed doubled. The monster tried to block but it was futile as the blade easily cut through it's carapace bisecting the monster in a gory spray. Minako was just standing there breating a bit heavily covered head to toe in neon pink monster blood.<p>"I'm going to need a shower." She giggled. "But now I understand Jupiter a bit better that was fun."<p>Ami of course was ignoring Minako as she was too busy scanning the monster to make sure it was dead. About halfway through her scan the two halves of the monster regenerated themselves into two monsters.<p>"Moon use your weapon. Hold them off while my weapon charges." Mercury yelled just before she reached into her subspace pocket and pulled out her weapon.<p>Moon hesitated before finally relenting. Shampoo and Minako had their hands full fighting both monsters. Minako was her friend and she wanted Shampoo as a friend. She screwed up her courage and pulled her weapon out of storeage.<p>"Moon<p>Safety<p>Scissors!"<p>-<p>Moon safety scissors:<p>Playschool brand safety scissors<p>Inable to cut paper, skin etc so Usagi won't hurt herself when she accidentally trips.<p>If she does manage to scratch something with it the scissors have a +5 vorpal enchantment on them.<p>There is a little moon symbol on the fulcrum.<p>-<p>Moon charged the monster Minako was on but was immediately batted away. Minako thought that they might actually have to call the outers for this when Mercury called out.<p>"Everybody get behind me NOW!"<p>Shampoo was the first to disengage, as she had more training, and ran off to be behind the blue skirted senshi. She didn't know much but she didn't want to be on the wrong end of what she was carrying.<p>Minako disengaged next and ran over to help Moon. They both ran aver to where Mercury was struggling to stay standing.<p>"Alright now let's see how this works." She said as she was straining to hold her weapon upright and pointed at the monsters.<p>She pressed the red fire button on the upper handle and her weapon started to shake.<p>Just for fun she decided to call out an attack phrase. Like it would matter.<p>"Mercury BFG!"<p>-<p>Mercury BFG 9000:<p>Weight: 250 kilos<p>Power source: Plutonium micro fission generator<p>It emits a positronic plasma beam capable of vaporizing hardened ceramic and starlight in seconds.<p>Organic material within 10 feet on either side of the beam takes damage as if it was in the beam itself.<p>Recharge time: 30 seconds<p>Fire time: 10 seconds<p>The BFG is the most powerful handheld mobile weapon in existance.<p>On the side is painted the symbol of Mercury.<p>-<p>The beam lanced out of the barrel and struck the monster on the left dead on. The monster exploded into chunks no larger than a quarter. The pieces turned to dust not long after. The monster on the right was not hit directly however a smaller beam shot out from the main beam and tagged it. The monster was also blown apart but the pieces were much larger, around the size of a roast. Still the damage was enough that it didn't get up again. The pieces dissolved into piles of dust shortly thereafter.<p>Mercury the weakest of the senshi had killed two monsters with one shot. She was feeling pretty good about herself at that moment. She put the BFG back in subspace because even with her senshi enhanced strength it was damned heavy.<p>"That was sooo cool!" Moon squealed. She wished she had a gun like that as she tripped over a blade of grass and fell on her face incidentally flashing her panties (thong) at the boys watching the fight from the windows in the school. She instantly became the most popular sailor scout.<p>Mercury and Venus grabbed Moon and took off for a secluded area so they could change back and get back to class.<p>Shampoo was left alone in the courtyard. There were several piles of dust on the ground from where the monsters died. Looking farther she noticed a swath of dead grass that had been in the beam's path.<p>Shampoo shuddered as she put her sword back into her subspace pocket. This kind of power was not something she ever wanted pointed in her direction. Maybe being their friend would be a good thing she thought as she jumped the three stories to get back to her classroom.<p>When she landed on the windowsill those students who had been watching scrambled to get away from her. Sailor scouts were one thing but Shampoo wasn't a sailor scout. Even the perverts didn't give themselves much of a chance against her if they ever ticked her off.<p>Shampoo noticed that Usagi, Minako and Ami had detransformed and snuck back into the classroom without being seen. Usagi being quiet will wonders never cease.<p>"Alright class show's over back to work." Said Ms. Haruna over the din of all the students talking about the senshi and their new weapons. While it was unanimous that Mercury's gun was the coolest most of the guys were talking about Sailor moon's panties or the lack thereof. Usagi had her head down on her desk so they couldn't see her blush. Ami of course was right in there with the geeks trying to figure out how the weapon worked. She of course had the advantage of already knowing how it worked.<p>When Ms. Haruna shouted out for everybody to be quiet and get back to work they obeyed. There would be plenty of time to discuss Sailor Moon's choice of underwear later, as right now Ms Haruna was the bigger threat.<p>The rest of the day passed uneventfully, well except for Usagi who disappeared for a bit durring gym class.<p>At the end of the day Shampoo was walking back to her new home. She was downcast because Ranma and Makoto did not return this afternoon like that green haired sailor had told her. Looking back she noticed that red skirt and the small pink haired one had joined in the procession following her back to Mrs. Saotome's house. She sighed as she saw a black sports car parked outside the gates. In it she saw three girls. Probably the other three sailors. She hoped that they weren't here to make trouble. One or two of them she may be able to handle but all of them.<p>Shampoo didn't think their chances were very good.<p>They all followed her through the gate and upto the front door. When she got there Walter was there to let her in. He was in his human form however she saw that Mrs. Saotome was in her hybrid form talking to her great-grandmother.<p>"Welcome home young miss." He looked behind her. "Ah yes these must be Makoto's friends am I correct?" They all nodded even Haruka. "So you're the ones who tried to kill her and made her run off." He punctuated his statement by shifting into his hybrid form.<p>Just as they were reaching for their transformation pens Nodoka came up behind Walter and shoved him off to the side. He landed in a heap on the floor.<p>"Walter there is no need to scare them. I'm sure they just came here to appologize to Makoto." She turned her full attention towards the potentially lethal schoolgirls infront of her. "Is that right?" Please let her be right or at least fast enough to kill them all before they could transform.<p>Usagi stepped forward. She was sniffling, her eyes were watering and her lip was trembling. She looked like she would explode into waterworks at any time now.<p>"Ok ok come in. They're not back yet but they should be back soon, you're welcome to stay for supper." She smiled. At least now she won't have to clean the blood out of her fur.<p>Walter led the group to the living room. The girls were all nervous as they followed him. Once they got to the living room Usagi noticed the game system. She immediately raced over and picked up the controller.<p>"Usagi that's not yours now sit down!" Rei yelled.<p>"Now, now if she wants to play let her." Keep her occupied so they didn't think about killing them.<p>Nodoka and Walter retired to the kitchen to prepare supper for the girls, while Shampoo and Cologne were left to entertain the girls. They started out by playing a fighting game. Each of the girls taking a turn. Cologne originally declined the offer to play but after some pretty good begging by Usagi she finally relented. Nobody could beat her of course. After 300 years her reflexes were so finely tuned that she could rattle off combo's faster than the machine could process the commands. The only one who came close to beating her was Shampoo. The beatings continued for about a half an hour before they heard the front door open.<p>Ranma and Makoto had just gotten home from their little run in the wild. Both of them were covered in small scratches, grass/leaves/twigs, and lots of dirt. What had happened was that Makoto was feeling playful so when she got close to Ranma she slapped him on the rump with her paw. He spun around and lunged at her. He misjudged and went tumbling. He got up and lunged for her again and tagged her this time. He then ran away. Makoto chased him to tag him back. It eventually degraded into a highspeed game of tag which then further degraded into a wrestling match.<p>By the time that they had worn themselves out they noticed that they had gotten quite lost and it was getting quite late. They started backtracking and eventually figured out which way to go and headed back to Tokyo.<p>When they reached Tokyo they were presented with another problem. Ranma didn't want to do another 'mad run' through the streets of Tokyo so he had Makoto follow him. He developed a series of signals so that he could tell Makoto when to crouch down, when to hide, and when to run. It took a while and she was spotted a few times but she eventually got the basics of stealth down. Of course when Ranma hid she had a hard time finding him even when she saw him hide.<p>She briefly thought about playing hide and seek but thought better of it until she got better at tracking by scent. She looked over to where Ranma was currently hiding. She couldn't see him at all even though he only had a small box to hide in. She marvalled at how flexable she must be to contort her body to fit in the box without any visible signs that she was in there.<p>When the coast was clear Makoto watched as Ranma flowed out of the box. It was like watching water flowing over a stone in a river. She felt jealous that her fiance had so much grace. In comparisson she was an overgrown hippo pounding through the underbrush letting out rauckous farts every so often.<p>Nobody can berate yourself better than you can.<p>They eventually made it back to the house. Once they jumped the wall they were pretty much home free. Opening the door was a bit of a challange but after about thirty seconds Ranma finally got it open. Once they were inside Ranma closed the door. They heard the tv in the living room and Ranma's game system. Makoto ignored it and went upstairs to get the dirt off and put on some clothes.<p>Ranma being the curious cat he was decided to let Makoto get cleaned up first while he checked out the guests. When he got to the living room he just walked in and froze. There was Cologne whipping Usagi's butt at Street Fighter Zero alpha Omega 3. Usagi turned her head after she'd lost yet again to Cologne's mad skillz and stared right into Ranma's eyes.<p>Cheetah + young + nothing between the legs = Makoto<p>"Mako chan!" She screamed as she launched herself at the frozen cheetah.<p>Ranma was too stunned to dodge and was the recipient of a very good facimile of an amazon glomp. Usagi's arms were wrapped tightly around Ranma's neck and she was bawling her eyes out. If Ranma could breath he would have noticed the similarities to Mr. Tendo. Unfortunately he was just trying to breath right now. His mouth was open and his tongue was hanging out. His eyes were rolling up and he was turning blue. Luna would have recognized the signs as the same as she got when Usagi got 'over affectionate'.<p>Usagi was still strangling Ranma and sobbing but now she was babbling out some kind of appology. Ranma just wished she'd gone up with Makoto to get cleaned up and changed back to his guy form. Well that and for this damned ditzy blond to let the fuck go of him.<p>"Oh Mako Chan we're so sorry" *snurk* "we didn't know" *sniffle* "we... we..." *honk* "We're Sorry can you forgive us! Wahhhhhh"<p>Ranma was trying to stay away from the light at the end of the tunnel when Makoto finally stepped into the living room. She was clean and dressed in one of Ranma's red silk shirts and black pants. She was in her hybrid form and had her arms crossed underneath her breasts and was tapping her foot on the floor.<p>"Alright I forgive you; now let go of Ranma I don't think he can breathe."<p>Usagi loosened her grip on the cheetah. She looked at Makoto then at the cheetah then back to Makoto.<p>"Um if you're over there who's this?" She said before she reached between the cheetah's legs to make sure it was female. Yup female.<p>"That would be Ranma that you strangled." No she was not jealous.<p>"But Ranma is MALE this cheetah is FEMALE. I at least know the difference between boys and girls Makoto." She checked again this time actually sticking her finger in just to make 100% sure.<p>The sensation of being fingered in female form was enough to jumpstart Ranma's oxygen starved brain. She jumped out of Usagi's grip<p>and ran towards the kitchen. Hopefully she would be able to at least change back to a male cheetah there. The sensation of Usagi sticking her fingers there was just so wrong.<p>Back at the living room Makoto had her head in her hands. The rest of the girls were all blushing. That's not to say they weren't confused. Shampoo was trying to get past her great-grandmother to strangle the stupid meatball head.<p>"Usagi I can't believe you just did that!" Rei shouted at her bunny brained friend.<p>Usagi brought her slick fingers up to her eyes. She took a whiff.<p>"But it was a girl! Makoto's fiance is a guy!"<p>"I believe that I can answer that." Cologne interjected. She grabbed a glass of water that was on the table and doused Shampoo with it. She immediatly shrunk down and disappeared into her dress.<p>Cologne reached into the now empty dress and pulled out a pink, purple and white hissing cat. The cat started hissing and spitting and trying to claw Usagi. Cologne had a good grip on the cat so it looked like Shampoo was hanging vertically and clawing mid air. The girls shied away from the viscious feline.<p>"Near our villiage there is a valley of accursed springs, if anything falls into one of the pools they are cursed to take on the form of the last thing to drown in the pool. Cold water activates the curse and hot water returns the victim to their original form." Shampoo stopped trying to claw Usagi's eyes out and turned to glare at her great-grandmother. "As you can see my great granddaughter fell into the spring of drowned cat." Shampoo thought briefly of trying to shred her great-grandmother. She dismissed the thought however when she realized that she couldn't do much to her great-grandmother in this form.<p>"Wait a minute." Said Ami jumping into the conversation. "If your granddaughter is cursed to become a cat then Ranma is cursed..."<p>"To become a girl when hit with cold water." Makoto finished still glaring at Usagi. "If it wasn't so funny I'd hit you." She said cracking a smile. "Although I'd stay away from Shampoo and sharp objects for a while. After all he is her husband and only she's supposed to touch him there." She broke down into giggles.<p>Usagi gulped and looked towards Shampoo. The cat was still glaring at her and growling in a low menacing tone.<p>"Um would it help to say I'm sorry."<p>The cat shook it's head.<p>Usagi looked at Cologne. "Is there a cure for her curse?"<p>"No child. For the rest of her life Shampoo will change into a cat when hit with cold water."<p>Usagi had a brain wave. It was small and insignificant of course but when that one neuron fired it was like a chorus in heaven.<p>"Maybe I can cure her curse!" Of course the gods were laughing their diefic butts off at this.<p>"Child I am not so sure of that many have tried and many have failed before. What makes you so certain that you can succeed." Shampoo had only heard up to the point about curing her curse. She conveniently ignored Cologne's sceptacism.<p>"Because I have love and justice on my side. Well that and a class one magical artifact."<p>Cologne's face met the floor. Of course since she went through the breaking point training she wasn't hurt.<p>Cologne was about to respond to Usagi's boast of having a class one magical artifact when Nodoka stepped into the room. She had an apron on that had a few blood stains on it. She was still in her hybrid form.<p>"Well now it seems that the misunderstanding has been cleared up."<p>"Yes Aunty everything is fine now. They're not going to try and kill me anymore." She of course would keep a close eye on them of course. Friends or not Uranus had spells of 'bad aim' where she would 'accidentally' shoot at her own teammates.<p>The other girls nodded.<p>"That's good. I'm making plenty of food so you're all welcome to stay for dinner."<p>Minako spoke up. "After you uhh ran out at the meeting Setsuna explained everything." She said kind of depressed, then brightened up a lot before continuing. "She gave all of us that don't have weapons, weapons so that we can fight!" She said happily as she pulled out her chainsaw. "Here's my Love me chainsaw! Isn't it just the best!"<p>Rei was next as she pulled out her Mars fire bat. It was an aluminum baseball bat with an enchantment on it so that it wouldn't dent or break.<p>Mirachu pulled out her desert eagle .50. It wasn't magical but with the hollow tips it could do a hell of a lot of damage.<p>Ami was next as she pulled out her BFG 9000. Of course since she wasn't transformed at the time she couldn't hold it up and it fell to the floor with a thump. Makoto walked over to where Ami was.<p>"How do you use it if you can't even hold it?"<p>"When I'm sailor mercury I can hold it but it's still heavy." She said while struggling to lift it.<p>Makoto walked over and picked it off of the floor with one hand.<p>"It's not that heavy." She said while almost effortlessly swinging it around. Ami was dumfounded. Just how strong was Makoto now? Ami then smiled. She had just found a guiny pig!<p>A certain red haired genius sneezed.<p>Makoto turned to look at Usagi. "So what did Pluto give you?"<p>Usagi sniffled and pulled out her safety scissors. Makoto doubled over in laughter.<p>"Well at least I got Something! She didn't leave you anything!" Usagi shot back.<p>Makoto stopped laughing.<p>"She didn't?" Why would Setsuna give everybody else something but leave her out.<p>"Nope nothing. Now that I think about it you don't have a weapon so why would she leave you out?"<p>Nodoka thought to interject before Makoto could say anything.<p>"Makoto dear." She said while holding her hands up and flexing her fingers.<p>Makoto's eyes widened in realization. The reason Setsuna didn't give her anything was that she already HAD weapons. She smiled.<p>"Actually I DO have weapons."<p>"What? What did you get!" Usagi was eager to see what her friend got. It just had to be better than the crappy 'weapon' that she got.<p>Makoto smiled, crossed her arms over her chest and brought out her claws with a nice satisfying<p>Shing<p>Two foot long gleaming white claws emerged from between her fingers.<p>"I think I'm well armed." She said while bringing her claws down to her sides in a wide sweaping arc.<p>The girls were shocked speechless. Normally only the monsters they fought had claws that big. This kind of thing would take some getting used to.<p>While the girls were a bit out of it. Nodoka decided that now would be a good time to address something that had been bothering her ever since Makoto had gotten home.<p>"Makoto why are you wearing my son's clothes?"<p>"Because mine were destroyed." She responded.<p>"Oh my son is so manly!" Nodoka giggled. Ranma had ripped off Makoto's clothes and they made out under the stars. "Although I do wish he would have at least had some control to at least undo the buttons first." Visions of kittens danced in her head.<p>There was an 'Awk' and the sound of something tumbling down the stairs in the background but everybody ignored it in favor of listening to see if Makoto had gotten her cherry popped.<p>"Aunty! Ranma didn't do anything to me last night! My clothes were destroyed by wind resistance!"<p>"Wind resistance?" Said Ami as she recovered first from seeing Makoto's claws.<p>"Wind resistance?" Nodoka's eyes widened as she finally realized what Makoto was talking about. "Wind resistance! I'm so sorry I completely forgot about that. I haven't been able to run that fast in years." She once ran so fast that she hit the sound barrior and she was one of the fastest runners in the tribe.<p>"What do you mean wind resistance? Just how fast can you run?" Ami was getting more and more excited.<p>"Well Ranma's faster, I mean he broke the sound barrior. All I could do was get up to the barrior but I couldn't get through."<p>"You can run faster than Sound!" Haruka was having a problem with that. She was into speed but that was a bit much for her ego to take that somebody could go faster than she ever could, and under their own power at that.<p>"No I can rrrun fasterrrr than sound." Said Ranma as he entered the living room.<p>Guinny pig #2<p>Ranma was dressed in a silver spandex one piece suit. He hated the thing because it made him look like he was wearing nothing. He put a pair of shorts on to conceal his lower regions however they did nothing to cover his rippling chest or legs. He was still in hybrid form so the suit was stretched tightly accross all the parts that counted. All of the girls who were old enough gave him an appreciative look, even Haruka and Mirachu gave him a second glance.<p>Cologne had let Shampoo go after she had calmed down. She walked over to where Ranma was and started rubbing against his legs. He bent over and picked her up and started petting her. She stuck her cat tongue out at the girls watching her. The waves of jealousy coming off all the girls could be seen in the air.<p>Chibi Usa grabbed Hotaru's hand and dragged her over to where Makoto was watching Ranma pet Shampoo. Chibi Usa reached up and tugged on Makoto's shirt. Makoto looked down at her.<p>"Yeah?"<p>"Could you change into a cheetah." Usa asked. She decided it wasn't time yet to bring out the puppy dog eyes.<p>"Uhh sure." She didn't like where this was going but Chibi Usa knew her so she guessed it was ok. She shifted to her cheetah form. The clothes became way too big on her all of a sudden. Chibi Usa and Hotaru helped her out of her clothes.<p>She was still wondering what the two munchkins were up to until Chibi Usa started petting her. Hotaru was a little hesitant at first but once she started petting her she didn't want to stop. Makoto's fur was short but it was a lot softer than she thought it would be.<p>Makoto was in heaven it was like getting a full body massage. She started purring involuntarily. Rei walked over and picked out a spot that currently wasn't recieving attention and started petting as well. Usagi was next pulling up a spot near her rump and started petting. Usagi was a little rough but a kick from Makoto and being berated by Rei made her ease up a bit.<p>Since there were already four girls on Makoto there wasn't much petting real estate left. Minako looked towards where Ranma was petting Shampoo. She gave an evil grin.<p>Nodoka being too old to be treated like a housepet decided to retreat to the kitchen before the girls got any ideas. Her son on the other hand could stand to have a few more female admirors. He he kittens!<p>"Oh Ranma! (heart effect) Would you mind terribly if you changed into a cheetah?" She used all of her feminine skills to try and push and prod him into changing so that she would have something to pet.<p>"Umm ahh well..." he stuttered.<p>"Oh go on son in law let the girls have their fun." Cologne said while grabbing Shampoo's clothes off the floor. she then pogoed over to where Ranma was petting Shampoo. she took Shampoo out of Ranma's hands and pogoed off to get her great-granddaughter some hot water so she could pet her husband too.<p>Ranma looked around nervously as Minako was staring at him expectantly. Ami was looking at him too. Even Mirachu was looking at him like she wanted to see him change into a cheetah. The only one who wasn't looking at him was Haruka. She had picked up the controller and had started playing the game.<p>"Well?" Minako said. "Are you going to change or not?" She said while tapping her foot on the floor.<p>"Alright fine." He threw his hands up in the air before he transformed into his full cheetah form.<p>"Yeah!" Minako shouted before she skipped over to help Ranma out of his clothes. Ami got up and walked over to where Minako was undressing Ranma she started helping.<p>Just as she was taking off his boxer shorts Shampoo came tearing into the room. Her chest was heaving as she had jumped off Cologne's shoulder and ran to the kitchen to get hot water and then ran back to the livingroom dressing along the way.<p>"Shampoo get head." She said between breaths.<p>"But..." Minako started to protest. Her protest was cut off by Shampoo pulling out her favorite sword.<p>"Shampoo Airen, Shampoo get head." She put her sword away when Minako started waiving her hands.<p>"Ok ok you can pet his head." She got as far away from Shampoo as possible before she sat down and started petting his rump. Ami sat down between Shampoo and Minako. She didn't like being a buffer zone between the two but if things got out of hand she could get out of there before they came to blows.<p>Shampoo started on his head gently stroking from front to back. On every third or fourth stroke she would scratch behind his ears. Everytime she would scratch he would lean into it and purr loudly.<p>Ranma was in heaven. No wonder cats were such sluts when it came to wanting to be petted it was absolutely glorious. Shampoo was doing a masterful job on his upper half. He guessed turning into a cat herself gave her a unique perspective on how to pet properly. Ami wasn't doing such a good job but she didn't own a cat so it was to be expected.<p>Minako could pet almost as good as Shampoo. He guessed that owning a talking cat allowed her the insight necissary to be able to do this right. Everytime she stroked he had to fight to keep his hid quarters on the ground everytime she lifted up to move her hand for another stroke.<p>He loved every minute of it.<p>Unfortunately everything must come to an end. Only about twenty minutes into the heavy petting session Walter came into the room. He witnessed the girls petting Ranma and Makoto and smiled. They looked to be having such a good time he didn't want to interrupt them but dinner was ready. He loudly cleared his throat.<p>"Dinner is served." He said.<p>When the petting stopped both Ranma and Makoto gave low menacing growls indicating that they should continue with the petting or somebody was going to get hurt.<p>"Now none of that you two. Alright everybody out these two have to put their clothes on." He proceeded to shoo all of the sailor scouts out of the Room. Shampoo refused to be shooed and was allowed to stay.<p>Makoto transformed back first. She stretched like a cat and moved back and forth. The petting was wonderful but her muscles were too relaxed. She had a couple of kinks to work out. Ranma of course was frozen on the ground staring up at her. Shampoo saw him staring and smacked him on the back of the head to snap him out of it.<p>"Stupid Ranma you see naked girl before no is special. Now put on clothes we eat now." She tossed his clothes over his head.<p>"Yeah you've seen me naked before but I've never seen your guy form before now change." She crossed her arms under her breasts propping them up.<p>"Shampoo see Ranma before but no see cat Ranma. Should be interesting." She smiled and waited for the show.<p>Ranma slowly stood up his back was to them. Makoto and Shampoo stared as he morphed back into a human. Bones shifted and grew while other parts rearanged themselves. When everything was said and done they were drooling over his well muscled back and tight butt. They were hoping that he would turn around. When he did tun around Shampoo's and Makoto's eyes widened. Shampoo felt... intimidated. She made a mental note to only be with him if he was in human form.<p>Ranma followed their gazes even though he knew exactly what they were staring at. He heaved a huge sigh and bent down to pick up his clothes. Their eyes tracked his every movement. He proceeded to put on his clothes. He dressed hastily but not so quickly that it was obvious that he was rushing.<p>When he was finished he was blushing so hot they could feel it from where they were standing.<p>"Umm I'm going to go eat now." He said before dashing off towards the dining room.<p>"You thinking what I'm thinking?" Makoto finally said.<p>"Shampoo go get crowbar and astro glide." She replied while wiping a bit of drool off her chin.<p>"I don't think it would fit."<p>"Shampoo try. Is always human form."<p>"Yeah I guess. Wow umm I wish I knew that before. He he he I guess this won't be so bad after all." Makoto's mind was currently slege diving.<p>Walter came back to the room a few minutes after Ranma had uncerimoniously left. He saw the two girls talking amongst themselves. He made a note to put the condoms in Ranma's room. the mistress may be eager for kittens but he knew that Ranma was no where near ready to be a father. He made a mental note to make sure he understood the birds and the bees before tonight. He imagined that Makoto and Shampoo had plans for him for tonight but they may not think of such things like protection until it was too late.<p>Ahh the job of a butler.<p>He loudly cleared his throat to get their attention. "Just a reminder that dinner is served. Please clean the drrol off of your faces and join us for dinner or do I have to carry you?"<p>Makoto jumped for her clothes and dressed in record time. She was blushing not that anybody could tell. Shampoo wiped her mouth off and straightened her dress so her nipples wouldn't show so much.<p>Walter smiled. Ranma would be a happy man... if he survived that is.<p>Makoto and Shampoo scampered off to the dining room with Walter trailing them. He was smiling for some reason. When they arrived at the dining room they found the rest of the scouts arrayed around the table. There were four spots left and they weren't together.<p>Ranma was framed by Minako and Rei. Ranma was looking decidedly nervous. Both Shampoo and Makoto frowned at this. He was their fiancee they should be the ones around him. Makoto gave a low growl. Minako and Rei jumped, both of them removing their hands from Ranma's thighs.<p>"Ahh I think I'll go sit by Usagi." Said Rei nervouslybefore she got up and bolted to the other side of the table.<p>"I'm good where I am." Minako being blond didn't quite get the first warning growl. Being picked up by the scruff of her neck like a naughty kitten and being brough face to face with a whole bunch of sharp teeth got the message through though.<p>"I think I'll go sit by Ami." Minako was trying not to wet herself. It wasn't socially acceptable to piss all over your host's floor. She looked back at Makoto's gleaming white teeth. Sharp gleaming white teeth that could tear her to pieces as easily as her chainsaw could cut through a sapling.<p>"Good plan." She said as she put Minako back onto the floor. Minako for her part didn't immediatly bolt over towards Ami.<p>Makoto and Shampoo sat down in the recently vacated spots and placed their hands on Ranma's thighs. He went back to being nervous especially when Shampoo started rubbing his thigh.<p>He was saved by his mom and Walter bringing in the food. They had several trays of meat some of which was still on the bone. They went back into the kitchen and brought out several other dishes. Some contained meat while others were straight vegetables. Once everything was on the table and both she and Walter were properly seated she spoke up.<p>"Alright what are you waiting for go ahead." She waived her hand in an arc over the table.<p>Everyone started piling their plates. Usagi and Ranma were having a silent competition to see who could eat the most. Curently Ranma was in the lead but Usagi was gaining ground.<p>"This is really good could you tell me what it is?" Ami was facinated by the meat. It didn't taste like anything she'd had before.<p>Makoto decided to answer. "It's called Takeshi." She paused to take a huge bite. "He's some guy we found wandering around. We thought he looked tasty so we brought him home for dinner." She let a bit of blood and juice dribble down her chin onto the table.<p>The girls that were chewing spit up their food and then reached over to grab their waters to wash their mouths out. Usagi was choking on her food because of the shock of eating Soylent Green... I mean people. She was slowly turning blue. Minako was saying something about 'Not again'. The only one who wasn't panicking was Haruka who continued to eat.<p>Rei jumped up and started the heimlich manouver to clear Usagi's airway so that she could breath again. She glared at the lauging cats at the table.<p>"That wasn't very nice you know." Commented Setsuna about ten centimeters from Makoto's ear.<p>Makoto jumped straight up and clung to the ceiling. Her tail was puffed up and her hair was sticking up all over her body.<p>Setsuna smiled and took a piece of the meat and popped it into her mouth. She chewed for a bit before swallowing.<p>"Delicious as always Nodoka." She said while wiping her mouth.<p>"You're welcome Setsuna, won't you join us?" Nodoka said while getting up to get another place setting.<p>"If you don't mind." She said while pulling up a chair.<p>"Setsuna how could you! I mean sure you're all high and mighty up there at the time gates but to actually eat a person!"<p>Nodoka was just returning from the kitchen and she just managed to catch the last part of the conversation.<p>"Have you been messing with the children again?" Nodoka said while placing the plate infront of her friend.<p>"No more than usual." Everyone was just staring at Setsuna.<p>"But... person." Rei started.<p>By this time Makoto had recovered and dropped from the ceiling. She had her hand raised to smack Setsuna in the back of her head.<p>Without turning around Setsuna said "You do remember that you're in your hybrid form right now." she paused to take a sip of her tea. "A dead scream would really hurt right about now." Makoto put her hand that was posed to smack Setsuna behind her head and smiled.<p>"Sorry about that I guess it was a bit of a mean joke to play on you all." She scratched the back of her head. "It's not human don't worry that was just a joke." She saw them all give a huge sigh of releif.<p>"Waf if is zen?" Usagi said around a mouthfull of food. She had a long way to go to catch up with Ranma.<p>Setsuna smiled. "Zebra of course. It keeps their claws from becoming brittle." She took a huge bite and chewed for a bit before swallowing. "MMMM nobody can make zebra like you Nodoka."<p>"If goom." Usagi said while she continued to stuff her face.<p>"Usagi you bubble brain do you even know what a zebra is!" She whirled on Nodoka. "Better yet just where in the hell do you GET zebra in Japan anyways!" Rei yelled.<p>Makoto pointed to the back of the house. "Out back. Auntie raises them. I originally thought they were pets but..." She paused to take a bite. "food works too."<p>Only the sounds of eating (shovling) could be heard for the next few minutes. Finally Rei got over her brain fart.<p>"Why the hell can't you eat something normal like beef or chicken like a normal person!"<p>Makoto made a big show of looking herself over. Then she looked at Ranma, Walter, and Nodoka. She pulled on her hair and her tail. She twiched her ears.<p>"I really don't think we're normal people Rei."<p>"It was a rhetorical question!" Rei shouted.<p>"Now Rei it's not nice to shout when you're a guest in somebody elses house." Setsuna calmly replied.<p>Rei shut up quickly.<p>Nodoka clued into something that Setsuna had said. "So Setsuna which scout are you?"<p>"Pluto." She responded before taking another bite.<p>"You know for all the years that I've known you I never knew that." Nodoka commented.<p>"Well until you found out about Makoto I really couldn't tell you about it. Besides you probably would have run for the hills if you found out who I was." Setsuna smiled.<p>"You're probably right."<p>"Auntie just how long have you known Setsuna for?" Makoto asked.<p>"Oh going on about 8 years now." Nodoka said.<p>Makoto turned towards Setsuna. "You knew didn't you?"<p>"I know a lot of things Makoto. If you're reffering to you being Sailor Jupiter, a were cheetah, engaged to Ranma, or the cadbury secret?"<p>"Umm all of the above except for the cadbury secret."<p>"Well I couldn't tell you anything or else it would have caused a paradox that would have ripped the fabric of the universe apart like a cheap napkin." She paused to take a sip "If you wanted to know the cadbury secret I couldn't tell you anyway."<p>She continued eating.<p>"Oh yes Makoto, Shampoo I was wondering if I would be able to borrow Ranma sometime in the future?"<p>"What for?" Replied Shampoo who was automatically suspicious.<p>"Sex of course." Was Setsuna's response.<p>"WHAT!" Yelled Makoto. "Are you senile old woman, why in the hell would we agree to that!"<p>"Easy in the next thousand years, I won't be the only one making that request." She looked pointedly around the table at the other scouts. "Lesbianism can only take you so far when you're not a lesbian."<p>The other scouts just stared at her then turned their gaze towards the trio of Ranma, Shampoo, and Makoto.<p>"Oh no you don't. Don't you dare put ideas in their heads. Sharing with Shampoo is going to be a challange but if I've got to share with the rest of them... Uh uh no way not going to happen."<p>"Shampoo agree no want share more than have to."<p>"Setsuna I know my son is manly and all but this really isn't something that I'm comfortable with. Why don't you find somebody your own age?"<p>Setsuna let out a hearty laugh. "Oh Nodoka you really don't know do you?" She said with a twinkle in her eye. "I'm over 5000 years old if I tried to find a guy my age he'd be dust."<p>Nodoka was taken aback by this. She had no idea her friend was that much older than she was. "I'm still not comfortable with it. Maybe at a later time. If you need it so badly I'm sure Walter would be more than willing to help you with that."<p>"Don't go volunteering me!" Protested Walter.<p>"Well I guess he'll do for a bit." Setsuna said ignoring Walter.<p>"Don't I get a say in this?" Said Walter.<p>"How long has it been since you were last with a man?" Nodoka asked.<p>"I think it was during the 60's free love and all. People kind of got stuffy after that."<p>"Hmm well you can have him tonight if you need to."<p>"You're just ignoring me aren't you?"<p>"Wow look at the time I've really got to get home." Said Minako looking at her wrist.<p>"Yes Hotaru's got to get to sleep." Mirachu said.<p>"No wait I want to know why lesbianism isn't good enough." Said Haruka before Mirachu grabbed her by the ear and dragged her out of the room.<p>The other girls excused themselves one by one. Usagi was the last to leave and she had to be litteraly dragged away from the table by her daughter. In the end it was only Setsuna, Cologne, Shampoo, Makoto, Ranma, and Nodoka.<p>"Well I think I'll be going then." She tossed two boxes towards Makoto and Shampoo.<p>Makoto got the box of extra large condoms and Shampoo got a box of large condoms.<p>"I'm pretty sure you know how to use those. It's not a good idea to be popping out kittens just yet." She took a final sip of her tea to finish it off. "Well what are you waiting for go to it!" She said with a shooing motion.<p>Makoto looked at Shampoo. With a nod from each of them Makoto tossed the box of condoms to Shampoo. She then picked up Ranma by the back of his shorts and tossed him over her shoulder.<p>"Hey! Don't I get any say in this?" Ranma protested.<p>"No." Responded a chorus of female voices.<p>Once they were out of sight Setsuna stood up. She snapped her fingers and was instantly dressed in her sailor fuku.<p>"Come on stud you've got some work to do tonight." She said as she tossed Walter over her shoulder.<p>"Hey! Oh well no use fighting it."<p>"Now you've got the idea." She said before she turned to Nodoka. "Nodoka dinner was great as always, I'll make sure to have him back by tomorrow. What shape he'll be in I can't guarentee." She smiled a bit.<p>"Have fun you two." Nodoka said as she waived.<p>One flash of light later and both Setsuna and Walter had disappeared.<p>"So elder do you feel up to helping me with the dishes?" Nodoka asked getting up from her seat.<p>"Sure dearie." Cologne said as she got up as well. "I just wish I looked as good as Setsuna does."<p>"I know. I always thought she just aged well." She shrugged "Who knew."<p>They heard a 'no it won't fit' and a 'yes it will it just needs some whipped cream.'<p>"Wanna go get drunk?" Cologne said offhandedly.<p>"Sure why not."<p>As the elder and the matriarch of the Saotome clan left the house to go out for a night of serious drinking and celebrating, the scene shifts to the cold depths of space past Mars, traipsing past Jupiter and Saturn, flying past Neptune and Uranus all the way to icy Pluto. It is a cold desolate world barely classifying itself as a planet.<p>It was here that castle Pluto stood cloaked in a distortion field to hide it from prying eyes.<p>It was in the depths of space that if one listened very carefully they would hear a faint 'Help me' as Walter finally realized that time is not relative at the time gates and that his one night stand was quickly turning into a week long affair.<p>He was running out of strength fast.<p>Authors Notes:<p>Here we are chapter 4. I'm working on cats tail and it should be out soon. I do appologize for the delay but it's been busy here at work and I haven't had much time to write. That and lunocracy well I just had to write it. It also seems that I have lost my prereader Rajon Rucker if you're still out there give me a shout.
