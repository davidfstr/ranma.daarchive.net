</div>A Japanese karate practitioner blocks a kick and delivers an elbow strike to his opponent, a huge muai Thai fighter. The other man's body spins on itself as it goes limp and falls to the ground.<p>The scene changes and a boxer is seen jabbing twice at his opponent, a Korean man, before delivering a devastating uppercut that that sends him flying back to crash on his back, a trail of blood coming out of his mouth.<p>Another change of scene shows a young woman dressed in black leather land a two-handed palm strike to a man's midsection. As he doubles over she finishes him off with a snap kick. His teeth are seen flying out of his mouth even as his eyes start to glaze over.<p>The screen fades to black slowly and a dot of light appears in the middle of it. Then there is a zoom in and the dot reveals itself to be a logo that covers the entire screen.<p>'T H E K I N G O F F I G H T E R S T O U R N A M E N T'<p>Nabiki turned off the TV set and smiled to herself. Only a week had gone by and they had already started with the publicity for the tournament. Geese really knew what he was doing and since they joined their resources for this project it would be ready in no time.<p>"Maybe I should enter this tournament." Akane said from her sister's side. The entire family save for Kasumi was in the room. "It seems like a good way to prove my skills." She said with determination.<p>Nabiki just shook her head. Both Genma and Soun had spent the entire week feeding Akane with lies about her skills, but she had to admit Akane had recovered from her loss and had started training again. She wasn't as arrogant as before losing to Kasumi, but if the fathers continued with what they were doing her little sister would be.<p>Soun nodded. "Indeed, Akane-chan. You'll get the chance to prove yourself as a fighter and show the world the power of the Anything Goes." He didn't part his gaze from the shogi board, though. Genma was paying close attention to his movements.<p>Nabiki shrugged. "Just remember you can't sign in for that tournament. You have to be invited to attend." And she had no intention of sending an invitation to her sister. *There's no way I'm letting her face some of the fighters out there.* Together with Geese she had spent a good deal of her resources locating fighters all over the world and sending the invitations. She was shocked when she discovered what some of those fighters were capable of.<p>"I'm sure Akane-chan will get an invitation." Kasumi said as she entered the room. "Wouldn't you agree, Nabiki?" She asked sweetly.<p>Nabiki knew well enough that wasn't a question. *How did she find out?* "We'll see." She said making it a point to lock gazes with her older sister.<p>Akane, Genma and Soun stared strangely at the interaction between the siblings. It almost seemed like they knew something and weren't telling.<p>Genma turned back to the game. "I would suggest you start looking for teammates, Akane-chan. It seems like they're introducing a team battle system for the tournament."<p>Genma's words brought the others out of their thoughts. Akane seemed to consider the option for a moment and frowned. "I don't have any friends that would be able to enter with me."<p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "What about Kuno-chan? He's really improved in these past few weeks."<p>Akane grimaced. Even though it was nice not to have to fight off the guy she would never feel comfortable around him. "I pass." She said.<p>"The tournament isn't due for another month and a half. I'm sure you'll find someone." Kasumi said as she entered the kitchen to continue working on dinner.<p>Nabiki just shook her head. If anyone in the dojo could join the tournament it would be Genma. He was a master of Anything Goes and, unlike Soun, had kept up his training even if Ranma no longer lived here. *I have to give it to him. He's a lazy ass most of the time, but he takes training very seriously.*<p>Nabiki got up and headed to her room. She needed to get ready for tonight's meeting. Organizing this tournament was fun, but it was also a lot of work.<p>Akane decided to go to the dojo for a little training, convinced that she needed to hone her skills for the tournament.<p>The adults remained in the room, absorbed in the game.<p>Or at least one of them did. The other was thinking how to use this tournament to his advantage.<p>-<p>He knocked on the door hard, revealing his current mood. As he retrieved his hand he turned to down to his side. His eyes met with the nervous expression on his daughter's face. "You should calm down." He said as he let her know just how disappointed he was on her. "I'll take care of what you couldn't."<p>Before she could protest the door opened. They both instantly studied the person who answered their rather rude call. "Yes?" The woman asked in a calm voice. Tall, stern and strong looking with blue hair.<p>The man blinked a couple of times before answering. "We're here to see Saotome Ranma."<p>The woman didn't react at all to his demanding tone of voice. "I'm sorry, but I don't know anyone here who goes by that name." She started to close the door and looked at the man hard when he stopped her.<p>"I was told he goes by the name of Todo Ranma." He said.<p>"Please let him in, Leona." A female voice was heard from inside.<p>Leona opened the door and stepped aside, silently inviting the visitors to enter the house. They both entered and made their way to the living room, where they found a redheaded woman sitting by the table. A little girl sat on her lap, playing with some water paint on a piece of paper. The redhead seemed to be very interested in what the girl was painting. "Kuonji-san." She greeted without taking her eyes off what Yoko was doing. "Please, take a seat."<p>Ukyo and her father both seated themselves by the table. Leona did likewise, but she sat to the side not to interfere in the discussion. Ukyo gazed sadly at the little girl as she happily played with the paint. *She should have been mine.* She thought wistfully, and knowing full well that even if there had been a chance of getting Ranma from Kasumi, which wasn't likely at all, she blew it when she helped Shampoo to attack his daughter as well. "Ranchan..."<p>Ranma looked up at Ukyo with an expression the chef had never seen before on her face. It was the facial expression that made Ranko Howard feared in the other world. Her eyes were cold as she stared dispassionately at her former friend. "Please don't call me that again. You lost that right when you placed in danger both my wife and daughter."<p>Ukyo looked away, unable to stand the redhead's blue-gray eyes boring into hers.<p>Kuonji Haruka stared hard at the redheaded woman in front of him. He found it hard to believe that she was Ranma, but Ukyo had explained the curse quite thoroughly. "My daughter informed me that you got married behind her back, ignoring the agreement of honor made between me and your father."<p>If Ranma was bothered by the accusation she gave no sign of it. With a gentle smile she leaned and whispered in Yoko's ear. "Can you go to the kitchen and ask mommy to get some hot water? You can also show your drawing to her."<p>The little girl was ecstatic at that and rushed out of the room, the painting in hand. Ukyo stifled a sob at seeing the picture. Even if a little girl drew it it was still quite clear to her. It was a picture of Ranma and Kasumi holding hands.<p>Ranma's smile vanished as soon as Yoko left the room to be replaced by her cold demeanor. She met Haruka's gaze as she answered the accusation. "The young man engaged to your daughter was Saotome Genma's son, Kuonji-san."<p>Haruka slammed a fist on the table. "Don't play games with me, boy."<p>Ranma frowned at that. "What do you want me to do? To leave my family so I can marry a girl half my age?" The pigtailed martial artist wouldn't beat around the bush. She knew what Haruka wanted her to do.<p>"When you abandoned her you took her womanhood with you!"<p>"I was only six at the time. And don't try to put the blame on me, you should be after Genma. He's the one you made the deal with." Ranma said, trying to avoid the confrontation she knew was coming. Even if she didn't want Ukyo to be anywhere near her she still didn't want to hurt her further.<p>Haruka snorted. "You were the one promised for my daughter, not him."<p>"That makes a lot of sense." Ranma said sarcastically.<p>"Do you dare mock me, boy?" Haruka asked as his face flushed with anger.<p>Ranma glared at the chef, taking him aback with the coldness of her aura. "I would suggest you don't call me boy again. I'm a man and it's cost me too much to become one."<p>Haruka sneered at Ranma, even if his instinct was telling him to not push the girl further he ignored it and let his anger guide him. "You hardly seem like a man to me. You're even less of a man after your honor less actions with my daughter. First you abandoned her and now you betray her after leading her on for so long. No, you are not a man at all."<p>"Father!" Ukyo protested.<p>Ranma silenced her with a wave of her hand. She stared at the man in front of her expressionlessly. "If I'm not a man then where does that leave you?"<p>"What?" Haruka asked.<p>Ranma continued in an emotionless tone of voice, her eyes piercing Haruka's very soul. "You accuse me of not being a man for abandoning your daughter when I was too young to understand things, yet you abandoned her as well. You stripped her of her womanhood and set her on a path for revenge because you knew you were too weak to succeed."<p>"HOW DARE..." Haruka bellowed as he stood up in a rage.<p>Ranma interrupted him in the same tone of voice, not once raising it in volume. "You engaged your daughter to me because you wanted a strong man to take care of her. I can respect that even if it was foolish of you to trust Genma. But when things didn't go your way you put everything on Ukyo's shoulders instead of taking care of it like the man you accuse me of not being." The redhead continued even as she felt Kasumi stop by the door, Yoko hugging her mother's leg. "I have a daughter, and I have no intention of abandoning either her or her mother."<p>Ukyo by now had tears flowing from her eyes. She could do nothing but listen as her father continued verbally attacking Ranma. The redhead kept her cool as she answered to the accusations with words that made the male chef even angrier.<p>"I believe that's enough." Kasumi said firmly as she stepped fully into the room and stood next to her still sitting husband. The black-haired woman stared up at Ukyo's father. "You said what you came to say and you got your answer. Please leave."<p>Haruka glared at Kasumi. "You are the one responsible for this. You took away my daughter's chance of settling this matter peacefully."<p>Ranma jumped to her feet and glared at Haruka. "You want to start a blood feud, Kuonji-san? I'll finish it right here and now." If the man even thought of placing either Kasumi or Yoko in any kind of danger he was as good as dead.<p>Ukyo was startled at Ranma's words. "Ranma!" That was an open threat, and if she knew something about Ranma it was that he kept his word regardless of what others said.<p>Haruka tried to keep the redhead's gaze but couldn't. Something in her eyes told him she was deadly serious on this matter. "Would you kill my daughter as well?" He challenged, trying to salvage some of his dignity since he knew he lost the battle of wills.<p>Ranma snorted. "There would be no need. You did a pretty good job of it when you registered her officially as a boy."<p>Kasumi nodded and tried to return the discussion to civil levels. "The most we can offer is allowing her into the Todo clan registered as our daughter." She looked at Ukyo. "If you are set on getting rid of your daughter then we'll take her from your hands."<p>Ukyo's eyes widened at Kasumi's words. Her expression then turned to anger as she thought she was being offered that out of pity. Before she could protest, however, her father beat her to it. "Don't play games, woman. Ranma is marrying my daughter."<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed. "She was actually trying to make amends even if we don't need to. There's no way for you to force me into marrying your daughter."<p>"But the agreement..."<p>"Was made with Saotome Genma concerning a Saotome Ranma." Kasumi said as she placed a hand on her daughter's head. There was a certain tone of finality in her voice.<p>Haruka narrowed his eyes and calmed down. "I see. Then you leave me no choice." He pointed a finger at Ranma. "I challenge you, Saotome Ranma. Should I win you'll marry my daughter."<p>The redhead lazily looked up at the man. "I refuse your challenge."<p>"What?" Haruka asked in disbelief. "Have you so little honor that you would refuse a formal challenge?"<p>Ranma stood up with a grace that made the man momentarily rethink his chances of winning such a challenge. "For starters that challenge was made against someone that no longer exists. Even if you rephrased it I would still refuse such a challenge. I won't place honor over my family."<p>Haruka's face flushed in anger once again, but this time it was worse than the others. His fists clenched and unclenched spasmodically as he glared daggers at the redhead.<p>Ukyo stood by her father's side, her attention on Kasumi. *She's somehow affected Ranchan. There's no way he would value anything more than his honor.*<p>Ranma sighed when she noticed the man would stubbornly refuse to see reality. *I guess I'm somehow cursed to meet such people.* She thought thinking back to her meeting with Soun. "I musk ask you to leave, Kuonji- san. You're obviously not going to back down and therefore you're no longer welcome in Todo grounds."<p>"This is not over." Haruka said as he turned on his heels and stormed out of the house. Ukyo followed him, avoiding eye contact with anyone.<p>Ranma saw the man leave and sighed. "I know."<p>-<p>The Nekohanten was nearly empty after the dinner rush was over. That left Cologne alone in the kitchen, since Shampoo bolted from the place as soon as she was no longer needed. Mousse was still recovering from the beating he received, not that he would remain in the restaurant when the purple- haired Amazon was somewhere else.<p>The elder was having some tea as she attended the few customers coming in. "And I was enjoying the peace and quite so much." She said regretfully as she felt the presence entering the restaurant.<p>Surprisingly the usual shouts of shock and anger were missing as a small figure made it into the kitchen. Cologne blinked a couple of times at meeting with a sight she hadn't seen for a very long time. "Hello, Cologne." Happosai, grandmaster of the Anything Goes School of martial arts greeted seriously.<p>The elder of the Amazons chuckled inwardly while on the outside she was as stern as usual. *I should've known he would act like this when he found out.* "What do you want, Happi?"<p>The grandmaster snorted. "Please refrain from playing around with me, Cologne. You know very well why I'm here." He said as he sat down next to her. He nodded his thanks as she served him a cup of tea and took out his pipe. "What happened to the boy, Cologne?"<p>She nodded, knowing that even Happosai could take things seriously once every hundred years. "I take it you felt his aura?"<p>"As well as heard a lot of what happened from my students."<p>Cologne raised an eyebrow. "Did you know that Nabiki is well aware of everything that's happening there?"<p>Happosai gave her an annoyed look. "I couldn't meet her price."<p>Cologne chuckled, which annoyed him even more. "I see. What do you want to know?"<p>"What caused all of this? Ranma shouldn't have changed that much, even if he was in another world."<p>The Amazon nodded. "After he got to that other world he met a man by the name of Geese Howard, who he calls his master by the way, and was helped out of depression by him."<p>Happosai took a puff of his pipe. *So that's the other dark presence I'm feeling.* "Do you know anything of the people he came back with?"<p>Cologne shook her head. "You know very well how our dealings are, Happi?"<p>The old master just shook his head and snorted. For some time now they had come to an understanding. Whenever they had to, or rather Happosai had to, act serious they would exchange information. One question each, and they were to speak truthfully. "Very well, ask away."<p>The Amazon elder thought carefully for a moment. "Why the sudden interest in Ranma and his companions? You wouldn't come to me if you weren't desperate for information."<p>Hapossai's features darkened. "I once fought a man with an aura similar to what Ranma and another among his companions have. It wasn't a pleasant experience. Now. What do you know of the people that came with him?"<p>"Ranma's wife and daughter are with him. Kasumi is a fighter, though I haven't seen her fight yet, while his daughter is only five. A man named Iori and a woman named Leona also come from that other world. If my senses are correct they're strong fighters not to be messed with. Then there is Ranma's master Geese, who is probably who you're feeling. His wife and son are here as well." Cologne informed him concisely, then asked. "What will you do with your school now that your heir has escaped your grasp?"<p>The old pervert sighed as he closed his eyes. "I will continue training Natsume and Kurumi. Aside from Ranma they're the only ones with the discipline and skill required to take over my school. Losing Ranma is hard, but I had planned for it." With that he kept the silence for a couple of minutes. He broke it to ask his next question. "What color of panties are you wearing?"<p>Cologne glared daggers at the grinning grandmaster. She had to answer. *You'll pay for this.* Why was it that he couldn't remain serious for more than five minutes?<p>-<p>The next morning Akane and Nabiki walked to school together. Since the later didn't need to engage in her usual moneymaking activities she just kept informed of everything that happened. That also allowed her to arrive a little later, just before the bell.<p>Akane walked by her sister's side, thinking over her conversation with Kasumi last night. She stole glances of her sister as they walked, wondering if she should confront her with what she discovered last night while the middle Tendo was out on business.<p>"What is it, Akane?" Nabiki asked in amusement. Did her sister really think she wouldn't notice her obvious interest?<p>Akane jolted and lowered her face, a little embarrassed at being caught staring like that. Of course, it was the opportunity she was looking for. "Why didn't you tell me?"<p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "Why didn't I tell you what?"<p>Akane grit her teeth and turned with a glare at her sister. "That you have been helping Ranma and his slut. That you knew the hussy was a good fighter before I challenged her."<p>The accusations didn't even make Nabiki flinch. She just stared calmly at her sibling. "I didn't know Kasumi was such a good fighter. In fact I didn't know she was a fighter before I saw the dojo." She turned her attention to the front. "As for why I helped Ranma, I guess he deserved someone on his side for once. Regardless of how you feel what happened wasn't his fault."<p>"Wasn't his fault?" Akane exclaimed in disbelief. "That pervert just up and leaves and adds another hussy to his harem and you say 'it's not his fault'? And then he lets her humiliate me."<p>Nabiki stopped and turned a hard look on her sister. "First of all 'you' are the only one responsible for challenging Kasumi and losing. And how soon you forget. You were partly responsible for sending Ranma to that other world, where he fell in love and started a family because he thought he would never return."<p>Akane crossed her arms over her chest and snorted. "Just shows you how much of a pervert he was all along. I knew he couldn't be trusted."<p>Nabiki's eyes flashed in anger at that comment. "Are you so stupid that you actually believe that?" She ignored Akane's protest at the insult. "Look, I'm sorry. It doesn't really matter anymore, since Ranma's no longer your fiancé." She said with her features softening.<p>Akane stopped short at that and turned away. "Who'd want to marry that pervert anyway?"<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes and resumed walking. "Just remember he has no ties to us anymore. Don't let daddy and Saotome-san convince you otherwise."<p>Akane caught up to her sister and matched her pace. "You are the one organizing the tournament." She said, changing the subject.<p>The middle Tendo sister knew where this was going. "I'm not giving you an invitation, Akane. The tournament is only for experienced fighters, and even if you're good you lack the experience."<p>Nabiki accepted the fact that Akane was good at fighting. It was just her bad luck to be a member of a group of people that took martial arts to the next level. Even if she was the worst of the group, she was still very good compared to others, though her pride needed to go if she was to keep improving in the Art. That and she would need to start training more seriously.<p>Akane narrowed her eyes. "How am I to get that 'experience' if you won't let me?"<p>Nabiki eyed her younger sister through the corner of her eye. "This tournament is not for you to play at being a martial artist, Akane. For me it's business. For the fighters it's a chance to meet the strongest fighters of the world in battle." The school was visible now. They could see students getting in. "We sent Herb an invitation."<p>"WHAT?" Akane asked in disbelief.<p>"He is a strong fighter, just like some others we've located so far." Nabiki asked one last question before leaving Akane behind. "What do you think your chances are against someone like Herb?"<p>The youngest Tendo stood staring at her sister's back in shock for a few seconds. *Herb?* She still couldn't believe they would look for someone like the Musk Prince.<p>"Akane." Sayuri greeted as she approached her friend.<p>This brought the Tendo girl out of her shock. She turned to her friend and smiled, trying her best to fight down the doubt Nabiki put in her mind. "Hi, Sayuri." She then turned around them, but found someone missing. "Where's Yuka?" Sayuri and Yuka always walked together to school.<p>The other girl made a face at the question. "She's walking to school with Daisuke now."<p>"What?" Akane asked in surprise. "But I thought she always walked with you."<p>Sayuri nodded. "Yeah. But now Daisuke is tagging along. I just don't feel comfortable with him around."<p>The Tendo girl's eyes narrowed. "What is that pervert doing to Yuka?" Without waiting for an answer she turned to the street. Sure enough she could see Daisuke and Yuka walking towards the school. Even if she couldn't make out what they were saying she could clearly see both her friend and Daisuke had smiles on their faces.<p>Sayuri looked with distaste at them as well. She couldn't believe Yuka wouldn't say a thing when she left her alone with Daisuke. When she noticed Akane's eyes narrowing dangerously she took a step back. *Oh no.* She thought, wondering if Daisuke could take hits like Ranma usually did. Somehow she doubted it. Even if she didn't want Daisuke anywhere near one of her best friends she didn't want him in the hospital either.<p>Akane stormed towards the approaching teenagers. "What do you think you're doing?" She demanded as soon as she was a few steps from them, her eyes boring holes on the boy.<p>Daisuke turned to Akane with a confused expression. *Why's she angry with me?* He thought as he stared at Ranma's former fiancée.<p>Yuka stared at Akane incredulously. "Akane-chan, what's wrong?"<p>Akane ignored her friend and used a hand to push Daisuke back. He had to step back to keep his balance. "Stay away from her, you pervert!" The youngest Tendo demanded.<p>"Akane!" Yuka exclaimed when she saw the confrontation about to take place. Instead of turning around and running like she expected, Daisuke kept his ground.<p>"That's not for you to decide, Tendo." Daisuke said. He was getting angry as well because of Akane's accusation. "You have no right to chose Yuka's friends for her."<p>"I have every right to defend her from a pervert like you." Akane growled out. She cocked her fist back in a threatening manner, knowing he would back out.<p>Only that he didn't. Instead Daisuke motioned for Yuka to move aside before assuming a ready stance. "Dai, no!" Yuka cried as she took his arm.<p>"GET OFF HER!" Akane bellowed as she launched her attack.<p>It would be giving Akane to little credit to say she was going to hit Yuka. In fact her punch was going nowhere near her, and the girl probably would only see Daisuke get hit in the face. Akane, even if angered beyond reason, was better trained than some thought.<p>But Daisuke didn't see it that way. To him Akane's attack meant he had to protect the girl holding his arm. He pushed her aside as gently as he could, and did his best to dodge to the side. The result had Yuka tripping over he own feet and falling on her behind, and Daisuke just barely avoiding Akane's fist, which would've knocked him out.<p>"Why you!" Upon noticing Daisuke dodging and Yuka on the floor Akane came to the conclusion that the boy used her to get away from her attack. She renewed her assault, this time without Yuka in the way.<p>"Akane-chan!" Sayuri cried.<p>"Stop it!" Yuka cried as well, trying to regain her feet.<p>Daisuke blocked the first three attacks. In fact he was even able to land a solid kick to Akane's side. Of course, it should be known that the boy had only been training for a small amount of time. He had nowhere near his sensei's strength or skill.<p>Akane took the hit and grunted, but she trapped his leg and swept his other one from under him. Daisuke fell on his back hard, hitting the back of his head with the pavement. His instincts took over and he tried to get up, but he didn't realize where his opponent was.<p>By now the entire school was looking at the fight, many of them worried for the boy's continued health since Akane only got this angry with Kuno or Ranma. And Daisuke sure as hell wouldn't be able to survive a hit like those two. Nabiki was running to stop the fight, knowing her sister wouldn't listen to anyone until her anger was fully vented.<p>Akane saw as the boy rolled over and tried to stand. The movement placed him in front of her, his back at the same height she placed the cinder blocks before breaking them. She cocked her fist back, ready to deliver the blow that would finish the fight. She didn't care that one of her punches would probably cripple the boy for life. She was too angry to think reasonably, much less care. She was winning the fight, something that hadn't happened for so long.<p>Yuka saw what her friend was doing and rushed forward, trying to get Daisuke out of the way.<p>Nabiki reached her sister and tackled her from behind. She didn't stop Akane from delivering the blow, but she did make her lose her balance and robed much of the strength behind it.<p>Daisuke felt someone suddenly push him to the side, then cried out from the agonizing pain on his back.<p>The blow, instead of landing on his spine, hit a little to the right. The blow was strong, but not so much that it would cause permanent damage.<p>Yuka hugged the writhing in pain Daisuke protectively, tears starting to form in her eyes.<p>Akane struggled and Nabiki found herself suddenly landing on her posterior, not having the strength to keep her sister from further attacking.<p>It wasn't needed, though. As soon as Akane saw Daisuke incapacitated her attention returned to protecting Yuka, taking her away from the pervert. She knelt next to her friend, a smile on her face. "Yuka-chan..." She said as she reached for her friend's arm.<p>"GET AWAY FROM ME!" Yuka screeched as she tried to move away, dragging the injured boy with her. She wasn't making much progress, but either way kept up her efforts. Especially when she felt Daisuke go limp on her arms.<p>Akane reacted as if she had been slapped. "Yuka-chan..." She whispered. "I'm only trying to protect you."<p>Yuka shook her head, closing her eyes as she hugged Daisuke's unconscious form even tighter.<p>"Akane!" The voice of her older sister finally registered and Akane turned to regard her. No sooner had she turned when she felt a slap on her face. Nabiki glared angrily at her. "What the hell are you doing? You could've crippled him!"<p>"He deserved it! He was being a pervert!" Akane retorted angrily. She didn't really believe her own words, but her anger wouldn't let her back down from a confrontation. *I won. I'm not the one in the wrong here.*<p>"Kuno-sempai..." The sisters heard to the side. They both turned from their discussion to see Kuno of all people lifting Daisuke over his shoulder. Yuka still had a hold of Daisuke's arm.<p>Kuno Tatewaki stared down at the girl and smiled faintly. "Worry not, fair maiden. I'll take him to see a doctor."<p>"I'm going, too." Yuka said as she sniffled. Kuno just looked at her and nodded. He then turned to Akane. "Tendo Akane."<p>Said girl glared at him. "What do you want, Kuno?"<p>"You should learn to control your emotions."<p>Akane sneered. "As if 'you' are in a position to talk."<p>"I deserve that." Kuno admitted before turning and walking away, Daisuke draped over his shoulder.<p>Yuka just looked once more at Akane with an unreadable look before following the upper classman. "Yuka, wait." Akane called, but if Yuka heard her she gave no indication of doing so.<p>The heir to the Tendo School of Anything Goes turned to her sister. She would find out why her sister had interfered in her fight. In fact she was almost convinced Nabiki had something to do with how things went.<p>Only that Nabiki was already walking into the school, not once looking back. It was then that Akane noticed the looks she was receiving from the rest of the student body. They all looked at her with disappointed expressions on their faces. Then, as if by common accord, they all turned and started entering the school. "What did I do?" She whispered, then turned to Sayuri. "Sayuri-chan, why is everybody acting like this?"<p>Sayuri bit her lip and placed a comforting hand on Akane's shoulder. "Akane- chan."<p>END PART 17<p>Author's notes: The King of Fighters Tournament is on the way. More and more problems are brewing for Ranma and his family. And how will he react when he finds out what happened to one of his students? Wait for the next chapter and find out.
