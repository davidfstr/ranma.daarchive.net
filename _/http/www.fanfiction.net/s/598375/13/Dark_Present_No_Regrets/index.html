</div>The outside world dimmed until it wasn't there anymore. As the transparent walls rose from the floor, the universe became the space where those who were enemies would solve their differences for good. Two men destined centuries back to fight stared at each other.<p>"You finally got what you wanted, Yagami." One of them spoke with bitterness in his voice. Even if he knew family history as well as his ancestors, he still didn't like the idea of fighting his rival. Not like this.<p>Grinning maliciously, Iori stared at his nemesis with his cold eyes. "Indeed." His deep voice full of determination and lust for blood. He finally, after years of fruitlessly searching for this chance, got to fight Kusanagi without outside interference. His blood boiled in ecstasy.<p>"And what will happen after we're done?" Kyo asked in contempt. If he was forced to fight Yagami he would give it his all, just as he did before with the others. He was Kyo Kusanagi, and he wouldn't lose.<p>Iori took his hands out of his pockets and clenched his fists; popping noises were heard as he did. "There well be no after for you, Kusanagi." He fell back into his usual stance, gently swaying back and forth as he waited for the signal to start the fight. As far as he was concerned it wasn't the moment to talk, but to act.<p>Kyo nodded a little reluctantly. He knew for sure now, if not before, that Yagami wouldn't play around. The thought of actually fighting to the death with someone for personal reasons didn't appeal to him. Back when he fought Rugal, Goenitz and Orochi he was fighting to protect others. But this was the first fight he would enter with the intent to kill for himself. *There's no going back.* He thought to himself as he too fell into his combat stance.<p>The Yagami and Kusanagi heirs, fighters of the greatest caliber in any time period, charged at each other in an unspoken agreement. The time for words passed way before either of them was born. The time to finish this, one way or another, was now.<p>Iori knew Kyo's strongest point were his punches, which he covered in magatama. He himself wasn't bad in that aspect, but his attacks tended to be in the form of claws that rendered flesh and bone alike. So as he approached his enemy he kept close attention to Kyo's fists, knowing that if they started glowing, even very faintly, he needed to act.<p>Kyo studied Iori's form as they both ran at each other. He knew the Yagami style was extremely powerful, mainly because it wasn't completely defined. The fighters of the Yagami line always fought out of an instinct, almost animal in nature, they possessed in their blood from before the pact with the Orochi. Kyo's father once said Iori was way better than his father ever was, and quite possibly he was the strongest fighter in Yagami history. Kyo didn't doubt that, but he knew a Yagami would never be able to defeat a Kusanagi.<p>"KURAE!" Kyo's right fist was engulfed in fire as he punched forward and towards Iori's body. He didn't need to hit Iori in a specific place. The magatama would do the rest of the job, though if his punch connected solidly it wouldn't upset him.<p>Iori's eyes narrowed the moment he saw Kyo's right hand start to glow. *Now.* He managed to duck under Kyo's attack and countered with one of his own, though his hands didn't have his signature purple fire. His right fist connected solidly with Kyo's jaw, making the later take a step back. He followed it up with a left upper, making Kyo take another step back. Then Iori jumped forward and locked his fists together for an overhead blow.<p>Kyo cursed as he felt Iori's attacks connecting. He knew he had underestimated his rival as the pain shot through his jaw. He managed to stay on his feet even after the second punch, which was even stronger than the first, and prepared to counter Iori's move. He had seen it before, and knew of a weakness. As Iori closed in on him, the young Kusanagi clenched his right fist tightly and started concentrating. He jumped upwards, letting Iori's blow connect with his shoulder but letting his chi take the impact. "ORIYA!" He twisted as he raised, hitting Iori's body with the back of his right fist. The Yagami warrior fell back covered in magatama as Kyo landed and smirked. *I'm still the best.*<p>Iori cursed the blasted Kusanagi when he saw him perform his flaming uppercut. The satisfaction he expected to feel when connecting was quickly turned to displeasure at being covered in the searing flames of the crimson magatama. Iori rolled with the fall and glared at his smirking opponent. He didn't bother with words to wipe it off his face. Death would.<p>Kyo saw as Iori recovered from his attack as usual, meaning it seemed as if he didn't even feel it. He knew the Yagamis had an insanely powerful constitution, being greatly enhanced by the power granted to them by the Orochi. But that was also their undoing. Their tainted magatama wasn't good enough to face against the power of the pure magatama. He charged again.<p>*Fool.* Iori thought as Kyo attacked in the same matter as before. The same tactic wouldn't work twice on him. Before Kyo finished cocking his arm back to strike Iori was already on him. The purple-haired man slammed his hand hard on Kyo's face with enough force to take Kusanagi off his feet and slammed him down, cracking the stone of the floor. "SHINE!" He concentrated and called forth his heritage. The intense pain that accompanied the use of his magatama was ignored as usual, now even more so because his enemy was burning in purple agony.<p>Kyo felt his world explode in purple and every pore of his body scream in pain as the Orochi fire washed over him. He jumped back and to his feet, ignoring the protests of his body, since he knew Iori wouldn't hesitate to strike him the dead blow while he was down.<p>Iori didn't lose any time and charged again, for the first time in the match starting an exchange of blows. He quickly forced Kyo on the defensive with powerful blows that came even faster than before. *Guess all that training with Ranma paid off.* He thought in amusement as Kyo was unable to launch an offensive of his own.<p>Ever since Iori had lost that fight to 'Ranko' he trained harder than ever before, most of the time with the pigtailed martial artist. Fighting such a fast opponent with an impossibly strong defense was good practice to put pressure on the other fighter. Iori smirked as he saw Kyo grimace in pain as a few blows did get past his defenses.<p>Kyo frantically fought back as best he could. Yagami had improved beyond anything he thought possible. He was faster and stronger than before, and also had a better technique. His mind also reminded him it was the first time Iori managed a clean shot at him, without having to fight someone else before that. Now that they exchanged blows, and he was on the receiving end of most of them, he was trying to come up with a plan to survive. The problem was Iori had seen each and every one of his special techniques, as well as the fact that Iori's special techniques were faster in coming out. So far the fight had been on a normal level, with little fire being thrown at each other. That had to change if Kyo wanted to win.<p>Iori didn't relent in his furious assault, feeling Kusanagi's arms and legs start to give way under the pressure he pressed with even more power behind every blow. As he continued pressing on, his mind wandered back to his life, to all the suffering he had sustained to be where he was now. An image of his bastard of a father callously breaking his arm during a training session flashed before his eyes. The bastard was very well burning in hell as far as Iori was concerned. He had made everything possible to make Iori's life hell. He trained the young Yagami to near-death and in the process insulted everything he held dear even as a child. He killed Iori's mother in front of the child's eyes because she was making him soft by treating his injuries. He made sure Iori had no friends at all, only knowing hate and lust for Kusanagi blood. The man, if he could be called that, made sure Iori was nothing more than a Kusanagi killing machine.<p>Iori cursed the bastard even more, because he succeeded. Iori could tell his father succeeded in making his son into one of the finest fighters ever, ruthless to the point he didn't care about taking a life in a fight and skilled enough to have no obstacle in front of him. Iori hated violence when it didn't have a reason to be. He hated it because he himself was a violent bastard. And he hated Kyo because he was the reason for everything that went wrong in his life.<p>Iori grunted a little as Kyo managed to slip a kick to his unguarded ribs. He countered the attack by letting his elbow drop on the offending leg before Kyo retrieved it. *Humph. I'll finish him off. Then I can start my life again. A real life.* The image of a blue-haired woman appeared in his mind. A woman he was willing to try and love, even if he didn't really know what love was. With more determination than before, he increased the power behind his blows tenfold, his usually cold eyes burning with a determination born out of hate and love.<p>Kyo was still trying to build a solid defense as Iori continued hammering him with blows too strong to be true. He caught sight of the red-haired man's eyes and for the first time he saw something other than cold indifference in them. The young Kusanagi could see emotions burning brightly in those eyes, emotions all directed to one purpose, his death. He couldn't allow that, too many people depended on him for protection.<p>At first Kyo started defending himself waiting for Iori to wear himself out. Right now Kyo knew his enemy wouldn't be tiring anytime soon, but he would. With a growing sense of desperation he started looking for something to do before Iori started connecting more than occasional blows. *But what?* He didn't have time to form a plan when pain flared from his left arm.<p>Iori, getting impatient with the lack of progress, let one of Kyo's punches through his guard on purpose. Grunting as the punch packed more power than he thought, the Orochi warrior brought his right hand to take a hold of Kyo's forearm. With the strength acquired from countless hours of crushing stones with his bare hands, Iori dug his fingers deep into Kusanagi flesh and nearly tore the limb apart with a powerful shove down. A spray of blood and a scream of pain was his reward as Kyo jumped back holding his now useless arm. Even if the bone wasn't broken, the muscle was ripped to uselessness. Kusanagi wouldn't be using that arm during the rest of this fight. *And his life.* His mind added.<p>Kyo desperately tried to move his arm, to at least clench his hand into a fist. He couldn't will his fingers to move. Making a great effort to ignore the pain he turned back to Yagami, who wiped his hand over his chest leaving four crimson lines across his chest. This turn of events definitely wasn't good. *It's now or never.* Kyo already knew he needed to finish Yagami in one strong move or he wouldn't live to see the next day. Iori was simply too well prepared for this fight. Kyo Kusanagi would give it his all now, creating an attack that was strong enough to kill a god.<p>Iori saw the fire burn in Kyo's eyes just before Kusanagi's body started emanating huge quantities of burning chi. He nodded as he stood straight and lifted his right hand to nearly chest level. A small purple flame erupted from the palm of that hand. *Arigato, Kusanagi.* He wanted to destroy his enemy, but he wanted a true fight only a warrior would give. Kyo knew he was outmatched and still fought on, and that was something Iori could respect. Had they not been destined to fight to the death, both could have been friends.<p>Kyo groaned as he willed his power to flow for his best technique. His left arm hung uselessly to his side, but it wasn't needed.<p>Iori roared in agony as he continued collecting energy for his technique. A technique he would use for the first time in this fight, since even preparing it before training with Ranma was too painful to remain conscious. His roar could be taken for a war cry, but those who knew the true nature of the purple magatama knew its great price. The power was greater than that of the normal magatama, but that power came with a price, the user would feel himself burn from the inside as he summoned the power. Right now Iori was preparing to launch a HUGE blast of purple fire, so it took everything he had to remain conscious.<p>As one, both fighters let loose with their final attack. Kyo crying out incoherently as he launched his Orochinagi at Iori. The later launched a fireball through the floor with a bellow. "SHINE!"<p>The attacks both connected since one was going through the floor. Iori burst in crimson flames, while Kyo was burned by purple fire. They both left out a cry of anguish, though Iori's sounded weaker than the one he left out in preparation for his attack. As if refusing to die, the flames continued to burn the fighters for what seemed like an eternity.<p>Iori's world was pain. He could feel the heat eat at him from both the inside and outside. His eyes closed shut he fell to his knees, too weak to remain standing.<p>Kyo's world was pain. He could feel the power of the Orochi fire as it ate at him. He closed his eyes changing his vision from purple to black. He closed his eyes as he felt himself falling.<p>-<p>Ranko took a step forward, her features forming a worried frown. Both fighters were still covered in flames, and she could feel why. They were still powering their attacks in a war of wills. Whoever couldn't keep pumping energy into his attack would die.<p>The entire crowd was watching in silent horror at something they did not dare believe. Their hero, the great Kyo Kusanagi, was fighting for his life against that blasted Yagami. In fact his cries of pain could be heard all over the place. As one, they slowly started chanting Kyo's name, giving the guy their support.<p>The fighters watched in shock as the fight for survival continued. There was no going back now.<p>One of the flaming figures suddenly stood up, albeit slowly and shakily. With stumbling steps it made its way to the other and an arm shot forward with murderous intent. The cries were silenced and followed by a short gurgle before an ominous silence permeated the area. The flames, both purple and crimson died out almost instantly.<p>The angry crowd broke the silence as they cursed Iori Yagami.<p>Standing in the center of the platform, the smoking man looked down at his bloodied hand, still holding the windpipe of his enemy. His shoulders started shaking and he chuckled in his hand, trying to stop his mirth. He failed as he laughed louder and clutched his forehead, then it turned into a full-scale roar of laughs. Finishing his mirth he looked up to the sky, which was strangely clouding up. "BURN IN HELL YOU FUCKING BASTARD!" And he continued laughing.<p>This only caused the crowd to become even more agitated, and the security had a tough time containing them. Back down the fighters were all shaking with uncontrolled fury at the man that killed Kyo Kusanagi.<p>Ignoring it all, Iori continued in his mind. *Burn in hell, father. I've defeated you, making true what you found impossible. Kusanagi is no more, and so is your influence on me. I'm finally free.* His knees suddenly buckled and he felt himself falling again. Only this time he felt someone taking hold of him. He knew who it was from the feel of her aura, and reminded himself to thank her when he woke up. His last thought before everything turned dark was about never using that damn technique again, it was too tiring.<p>*******************************<p>"After that I don't know how people managed to turn things around and blamed Ranko for Kyo's dead." Iori finished as he took one last puff from his cigarette.<p>"Maybe because I let you a clean shot at him, knowing you would kill him." Ranma said calmly.<p>Kasumi nodded absentmindedly. "That might be so." By Iori's side, Leona didn't speak at all, her expression completely unreadable.<p>Nabiki and Tofu stared in disbelief at the casual acceptance everyone had about Kyo Kusanagi's demise. The story was quite bad, going so far as to say Iori and Ranko were the bad guys there. In fact they were, no question about it.<p>"Why did you help him?" Nabiki asked Ranma, her voice was a little shaky as she turned to regard the red-haired man. The coldness in his eyes was not something that reassured her.<p>Ranma remained calm as he answered. "The Yagami and Kusanagi clans took part in a blood feud for more than six hundred years. I simply put an end to it. I didn't know who would win that fight."<p>Iori nodded. "The others didn't understand that. They preferred the suffering to continue if it meant their precious boy wasn't in any real danger. He took all the credit for defeating the Orochi, even if it was a team effort to kill it. I can't say I did this for a reason other than killing Kyo, I hated him. But his death in a way stopped a blood feud that had been going on for far too many years, in the process killing many innocents."<p>Cologne nodded in understanding, even though she inwardly thought the Japanese to be stupid. The fact that Ranma helped Iori fight this Kyo in a fair match only showed that he already felt the Orochi warrior was his friend.<p>Ranma suddenly changed the subject. "I believe we should stop here for today."<p>Nabiki protested before the others had a chance to speak. "No way, Ranma. You haven't even told us how you met Kasumi, or what happened after that tournament." She wasn't a fool. She knew more must have happened for Ranma to be the way he was. If not he would be a ruthless killer right now, like he was back in that tournament.<p>Ranma chuckled and shook his head. "I met Kasumi quite a while after the tournament, Nabiki. In fact I met her after I returned from a long training trip in the mountains of China. Don't worry, though. You'll hear all of it." He stood up and offered a hand to Kasumi, who took it and stood up. "It's just getting rather late and someone just arrived."<p>Kasumi turned to her husband with an amused expression. "So soon? Seems like he couldn't wait to see you."<p>Ranma smiled back and placed an arm around her waist. "Must be because he wanted a roof over his head. It seems like we'll be having another guest for a while."<p>Kasumi leaned against her husband. "Yoko will love to see him again, too."<p>"Who're you talking about?" Tofu asked the couple as he, too, stood up. The others soon followed.<p>Before Kasumi could answer a knock was heard on the front door. Kasumi and Ranma walked to answer and the others followed curiously. Only Iori and Leona remained sitting on the table. "He's gonna give them quite a shock." Iori commented.<p>"Indeed." Leona answered with a small smile.<p>-<p>Nabiki didn't notice Tofu and Cologne stop behind her as she walked to the door. The Amazon and doctor could feel someone with a strong aura behind that door. An aura feeling as evil if not more so than Ranma's own. They unconsciously prepared themselves for a fight.<p>Kasumi opened the door, and a blonde man stood in the doorway. His eyes made Nabiki gulp and stand back a step. They held the same viciousness Ranma's own held when he fought Mousse. His aura was awfully similar to Ranma's as well, making everyone but Kasumi and Ranma uncomfortable.<p>Nabiki felt faint when she heard Ranma refer to the man in a respectful tone.<p>Ranma bowed slightly and greeted the man, who smirked in response. "Master."<p>The Immortal Geese Howard was alive.<p>END PART 13<p>Author's notes: Short but out in a week. That should make up for it.<p>Anyway, how did you like it? Geese Howard is still alive, and now we know what happened to Kyo Kusanagi and why people hated Ranko so much back in the KoF world.<p>Next chapter should deal with Geese and some questions people have for him. We also see the way Kasumi and her 'father-in-law' interact, and Yoko is really happy to see her grandfather again.<p>See you in part 14!
