</div>The time, early evening. The place, the Todo Dojo. Candles illuminate the great training hall instead of the pyres, making the atmosphere get tints of mysticism. The sweet smell of burned incense assaults the three people kneeling in the room, filling them with a sense of peace that none should be feeling. Ranma and Kasumi, both in their training clothes, kneel side by side. Their expressions reveal the seriousness of the matter. In front of them, Tatewaki Kuno ponders what has been said. In fact, the kendoist is the first person to hear the entire story. His thoughts clear after the traumatizing experience of the day, he ponders each and every word for its meaning. "An unbelievable story it is." He finally said. "And if I hadn't lived through what we have, I wouldn't believe you."<p>Ranma nodded. "I wouldn't believe it myself if it hadn't happened to me. Too many coincidences seem to plague that entire period of my life."<p>Kuno nodded. "Either way, I have dishonored myself and placed in danger the integrity of your family." He said to both as he took a new katana from his robes. This one like none he had used before. Placing it on the floor in front of him, he continued. "This is not the Kuno family blade, for the head of the clan still lives. Still, it is the katana I was meant to wear whenever I faced something that threatened the honor of my family. I find that nothing threatens that honor more than my past actions." He bowed so low that his forehead touched the wood floor. "I subject myself to you. Dying by that very blade should satisfy my honor and bring peace to your clan. Don't let my actions alone start a blood feud."<p>Kasumi turned to Ranma with a questioning stare. She was the head of the clan, and so the decision rested on her. She didn't see any anger in the man's eyes. Kasumi turned back to the still prostrated Kuno and considered the events that followed the attack. How the kendoist's eyes cleared and horror at his own actions was clear on his expression. He had seen Ranma in cursed form and didn't react aggressively at finding the truth. He rather felt ashamed and sad. Could she judge the man in front of her for the actions of another? "Get up." She commanded.<p>Kuno straightened and looked in resignation as Kasumi took his katana and unsheathed it. He closed his eyes to receive his punishment. Kami-sama knew he deserved it. He felt the cold touch of metal on the side of his neck, followed by a stinging sensation.<p>"Open your eyes, Kuno. You look like an idiot." Ranma said casually.<p>The young man opened his eyes to see his own katana, a thin line of blood on its blade. He touched his neck with his hand and wiped something that felt warm and sticky. Sure enough, a little blood stained his fingers. "What?" A paper cut would have bled more than this.<p>Kasumi handed him his sword back. "Blood has been drawn and honor was satisfied. The clans won't battle each other."<p>Ranma frowned. "That doesn't mean we forgive you as parents, though." Kuno nodded and remained silent for his former enemy to continue with the sentence. "You will make everything possible to atone for your past actions, as well as remain sane." Narrowing his eyes, he finished. "Or I'll rip your heart out and make you eat it before you die."<p>The words were said with such conviction that Kuno believed Ranma would do just that. Not that he intended to ever fall on the path of insanity again, he could see where that led him once and would be happy if Ranma carried out his threat should he ever walk it again. "How's your daughter?"<p>Kasumi managed a weak smile. "Already sleeping soundly. She tired herself trying to lift that stone you cut in half."<p>Ranma got up and helped Kasumi to her feet. He then offered a hand to Kuno. "Let our past be there, Kuno. In the past."<p>Kuno didn't hesitate to shake that hand and get on his feet. If Todo was willing to forgive, he was willing to forget. He was at awe at the man that for so long was his nemesis. The changes were incredible even with the story he had been told. *I guess my judgement was clouded.* He chuckled. *That's an understatement.* He looked at both Kasumi and Ranma and bowed. "Arigato. I won't forget this."<p>Ranma waved it off. "It's in the past, man. Now go home and change out of those wet clothes or you'll catch a cold and end up dying anyway."<p>"Hai." Kuno said. Then he turned serious and said. "Beware of her, though. What I told you wasn't a lie and she seems to truly hate you." With those words he left the dojo.<p>Kasumi and Ranma looked at each other with somber expressions. Of all the people they didn't expect something like 'this' from 'her.'<p>-<p>It was Monday and school had just ended. Ranma, Kasumi and Yoko ate peacefully as the students wouldn't arrive until later in the afternoon. It had been decided that classes would only be in the morning one day in the weekend, so that the teens had time to go out and have fun. The married couple wasn't really relaxed, though. Yesterday Akane and Kuno had attacked them. Kuno had been taken care of, but Akane's defeat would have its consequences. They also had to deal with the others as they came, and that didn't leave them much time to relax.<p>"Tadaima!" Sounded from the door.<p>"Aunt Biki!" Cried Yoko happily as she latched herself to the middle Tendo sister's leg. The student smiled at the gesture and ruffled Yoko's hair.<p>Kasumi smiled but either way scolded her daughter. "Yoko, you haven't finished eating." Faster than the speed of light the little girl was back on her seat. She wanted to go out and play, and having her mother angry with her wasn't the way to do it. The mother nodded and turned to Nabiki. "Konbanwa, Nabiki. Please join us." She motioned for her to take a seat.<p>Nabiki did so and looked at them both. "I heard Kuno attacked you yesterday."<p>Ranma nodded, unimpressed that Nabiki was already informed of the event. "We took care of it."<p>"What the hell did you do to him? I've never seen him like that before. He was..." She struggled to find a word to describe Kuno's actions in school.<p>"Normal?" Kasumi offered as she handed Nabiki a bowl with rice.<p>Nabiki nodded as she took the bowl. "Arigato."<p>Kasumi answered the question. "We had a little talk with him and we reached an agreement. What happened anyway?"<p>Nabiki thought for a moment and started. "The whole school was wondering where Kuno was. We didn't know of any fight where he was beaten enough to miss school and he hadn't been looking for you because he took your absence from Furinkan as an admission of defeat. The bell rang and he still hadn't entered spouting his poetry and looking for Akane." Ranma nodded. He wanted to know how Akane was, but decided to ask after Nabiki was finished. "In the classroom, when the teacher was calling role no one answered. We were all too shocked to see Kuno inside acting strangely." She smiled. "He didn't rant about being the Blue Thunder, he didn't look down on anyone. It was another person entirely."<p>"So what's not to believe? That could very well happen in Furinkan any other day." Ranma said matter of factly.<p>Nabiki continued as if Ranma didn't say a word. "He then burned down every single picture he had of 'Ranko' and my sister and declared publicly he apologized for his behavior towards everyone." She continued smugly at the surprise written on her listeners' faces. "He's right now training the Kendo team for the regional championship in the Kuno mansion."<p>Kasumi took Ranma's hand. She knew that deep inside he felt happy at seeing one of his enemies stop his chase of the pigtailed martial artist. Ranma's expression returned to normal as he asked. "What about Akane?"<p>Nabiki's features darkened at that. "She's got three broken ribs and a nearly dislocated left shoulder. But that's not the worst part." She looked to the table. "She's been crying nonstop since she woke up. She didn't attend school today and will probably be absent tomorrow, too. I think she was destroyed at being defeated without landing a single hit."<p>Kasumi was sad to hear Akane reacted that way. "I'm sorry, Nabiki. I didn't mean to be cruel, but the honor of the Todo Dojo was at stake."<p>Nabiki nodded. "I know. I don't blame you for it. It's just that Akane finally realized she isn't a great martial artist like she claims. That's tearing her apart and she's having trouble accepting reality."<p>"She'll get over it." Ranma said. "It was bound to happen. It's a good thing it happened with Kasumi instead of someone that might be trying to hurt her for real."<p>"Whatever. What are your plans now, anyway?" The middle Tendo asked.<p>"Keep training and adjust to life here. What else?" Kasumi answered matter of factly.<p>"You do know the others will come as soon as they find out about you." Nabiki stated.<p>The black-haired woman nodded. "Indeed. But we can't do a thing until they get here. Hopefully they won't come all at the same time."<p>"I've got some bad news." Nabiki said. "P-chan decided to come back yesterday in the evening."<p>Ranma slumped down. "Oh crap!"<p>"Ranma! Not in front of Yoko." Kasumi said as she motioned for her daughter, who looked at them attentively. Her husband had the decency to look ashamed.<p>Nabiki continued. "If how he reacted yesterday is any indication, you're gonna have your hands full with him."<p>Ranma shrugged. "Knowing Pig-boy, we'll probably see him again in a couple of weeks. Maybe he's in Hokkaido right now."<p>The rest of the conversation, and the day, was particularly eventless.<p>-<p>Early morning in the Todo grounds. A peaceful morning at that. The only sounds heard were the singing of the birds and the rustle of clothing. Out in the backyard two figures moved through a simple and graceful kata. To the casual observer, both man and woman practiced exactly the same kata, but a martial artist knew better. The girl that spied them noticed the great similarities and drastic differences between the motions of each. While the woman had a lower stance, which allowed more movement, the man stood straighter and nearly remained in the same spot. The blocks and punches were very much alike, but little differences defined the style of the practitioners. The similarity was though, in the fact that both katas were designed to fight the exact same imaginary opponent, who went through the exact same patterns.<p>The girl watched attentively as the kata came to an end and the couple bowed to each other with respect. When they kissed the spy tightened her hold on her weapon, her teeth gritting in barely contained fury. She had heard rumors about this, but she didn't really believe any of it. Until now, that is. Her eyes narrowing, she left her hiding spot and confronted the pair.<p>Ranma and Kasumi just finished their kata and kissed lightly when they both heard a light thump from behind. Turning to the source of the sound, they came to the image of a very pissed Ukyo Kuonji as she held her battle spatula at the ready. Her facial features revealed the pain of betrayal and the determination to get revenge. Ranma's heart hurt at seeing his oldest friend hate him openly. "Ukyo." He greeted, mostly so that Kasumi knew who this girl was.<p>Kasumi didn't know what to think about the girl until Ranma named her. Then all sunk in as she made the connection with the attire and the spatula. She frowned inwardly at what she knew would come. Ranma still cared for this girl, more so because she was his first real friend. She idly noticed Ukyo was quite beautiful in her own way. She let a small smile appear on her lips. *Isn't a single woman Ranma has met less than gorgeous?* She knew he didn't care about those things. The man had remained in a room with Mai Shiranui for two hours without looking at her bouncy chest, that was quite a task!<p>Ukyo's frown deepened when she saw the bitch that took her Ranchan away smile. "What are you laughing at, you little bitch?" She asked irritably, trying to stare down the shorter woman.<p>Kasumi's smile left her lips, but not because of fear. She was used to fighting much larger opponents than herself, so she didn't feel intimidated at all. No, she stopped smiling because she knew she had insulted the girl by doing so. She didn't want to make the situation any uglier than it would surely be. Ukyo finally broke the silence, which had become very uncomfortable. "I heard something at school that for your health will better be a lie, Ranchan."<p>Ranma looked at her with a sad expression. It seemed like he had lost his best friend even before he had a chance to talk to her. "How old am I, Ukyo?"<p>The chef noticed with even more anger the 'Ukyo' reference and turned a glare that could vaporize titanium at Kasumi. She then turned back to Ranma and finally noticed, through the mist of her anger, that her fiancé was indeed older than she remembered. Her shock had much less strength than her rage though. "So it's true. You did marry behind my back." She accused as her impossibly tight hold on her spatula threatened to brake the weapon.<p>Ranma lowered his gaze and let out a deep sigh. "I'm sorry for all I've made you go through, Ukyo. I didn't want to hurt you."<p>The chef's face flushed crimson with rage. "SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU BASTARD! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO APOLOGIZE!" Her bellowing had the added effect of attracting someone's attention from inside the house. Yoko stood on the door, her gaze fixated on the three adults. Kasumi looked at her husband questioningly, to which he nodded without looking up. The black-haired woman left in a hurry to attend to her daughter, mainly to take her in and save her the terrible scene taking place. Ukyo waited till they were gone and continued in a less thunderous voice. "You belong to me after the shit you've made me go through!"<p>Ranma looked up and Ukyo backed away in surprise. He had a deep frown on his features as he openly glared at her. It was the first time ever that he acted this way toward her. "You own me?" He asked calmly. "You're just like the other girls, Ukyo. I hoped against it, but you are." He turned around and started walking into the house. "You say you hate my father because he runs away from his responsibilities. Well, you can hate me for not doing so, since I won't abandon my family for some stupid promise that idiot made with your father. I don't want to see you. Not while you still think like this."<p>Ukyo wanted to say more, but the finality and power behind Ranma's words made her stand back. The Ranma she knew would never hit a girl, and this Ranma didn't attack her either. Physically, that is. The accusation hurt more than anything else he could have done, since he compared her to the other fiancées. "This isn't over, Ranchan," Hiding her tears under a mask of disgust she turned around and left the same way she came.<p>Ranma was glad Ukyo had left instead of trying to continue with the argument. That way she didn't notice the tears that left his eyes. It seemed like these days he cried more than the rest of his life all put together several times. *Who's next?* He asked himself, he embraced Kasumi as if his life depended on it. For in more than a way, it did.<p>-<p>After a few hours, the Todo house had two more guests. These days would be very hard on both Ranma and Kasumi, since they expected every problem person in Ranma's life to make an appearance. The people to visit were a complete shock, though. "Uhhhhh..." Was Ranma's and Kasumi's intelligent greeting to the arriving couple.<p>"Nice to see you too." Said the man with his deep voice. His amusement was clear on his features, though his smirk was a little strained. Kasumi finally regained enough of her senses to invite them in.<p>After about an hour of talking, they finally finished their versions of what happened. "So all you saw was the explosion as it neared you?" Asked Ranma, to which his guests nodded. He slumped down. "I wish there was a sure way to find out who survived." Everyone shared a moment looking downcast, as if they all carried a great weight. "Anyway, how did you find us?"<p>The man again took the word. "We read something about a new dojo opening. When we read the name we knew there had to be some connection."<p>"And why did it take you so long to reach us?" Asked Kasumi as she watched Yoko happily seated on the woman's lap.<p>Said woman smiled ever so slightly towards the girl and answered the question. "We were on the coast when we read about your dojo. It's a wonder the news of its opening reached that far."<p>Ranma smiled. "I told you everything that happens in Nerima is news. This place attracts a lot of attention with all the martial artists around. A new dojo was sure to make a lot of noise." His smile vanished as soon as it appeared and he asked seriously. "You don't have a place to stay, do you?" Knowing he would get negative responses, he continued without waiting for an answer. "You do now. But I must warn you, there will be a lot of trouble here."<p>The man smiled wickedly at that. "Good."<p>-<p>After having something to eat, courtesy of Kasumi, both men walked to the backyard. "What do you think?" Ranma finally asked.<p>The other man looked towards the horizon. "I don't."<p>Ranma smiled slightly at the answer. "So you don't have any plans for the future?"<p>-<p>"Not really." Answered the woman as they washed the dishes.<p>Kasumi sighed. "Think about it. Now that we're here you don't have anything stopping you from enjoying life."<p>The woman seemed to consider this for the first time. It was true. Since she had met her love they hadn't been able to be together due to their obligations. They had a clean start. "How are you coping with the loss of your parents?" She asked after a minute of drying the same plate.<p>"We're moving on. And don't change the subject." She waved a finger at the much taller woman.<p>-<p>"I like your daughter."<p>Ranma smiled proudly. "Thanks. She means a lot to us." He looked up to the room where she should be sleeping right now. "Man, is she a heavy sleeper?"<p>"Just like her father." Mocked the man with a smirk on his face.<p>"Can't argue with that." The pigtailed martial artist said as he sat down on a rock. "Ever thought of having one of your own?"<p>The sudden question startled the man enough to lose his balance. He recovered almost instantly, but the fact remained that he had been completely taken by surprise. He pondered on it for a while, really giving it thought for the first time in his life. "Not really. I never expected to be able to settle down."<p>-<p>"You can do it now. You have no idea what it's like." Kasumi said with a faraway look. "Ranma and I are planning on trying for another."<p>The woman's features revealed nothing. Her expression of calm detachment set in place. Though Kasumi knew her from a long time and knew which signs to look for. Her eyes were unfocused and her hands didn't remain in the same place for more than a few seconds. She was obviously struggling with something inside. "We don't know if we can have children. Since we never thought we were free to do it, it never occurred to us."<p>Kasumi smiled sympathetically. "It's not something you have to do, but give it some thought."<p>-<p>The man shook his head. "But what about after we have a child? You know we won't live for long. We'll mostly reach our late fifties before we die."<p>Ranma smiled reassuringly. "Maybe not." Seeing he got the man's attention with his proclamation, he continued. "I've been thinking about it. You two are a lot stronger than your ancestors. You also have much more control over your power. Maybe that'll help you to counter the curse of your bloodline."<p>The man snorted, though he was a little uncertain. "That's only a 'maybe.'"<p>Ranma nodded. "Yeah. A maybe with some serious evidence. You're about five years older than I am, but you look younger. The same goes for her. You may even outlive both Kasumi and me, and you'll be the one to look after our children."<p>The man looked at him oddly. "You only have one daughter, Todo."<p>"We are planning on having another." Ranma said as he got up. "What about it, man? Want to give our baby a playmate?" He said before he walked into the house.<p>-<p>Kasumi placed a hand on her friend's shoulder. "Give it a try. It's worth it." She left the kitchen as her friend was deep in thought.<p>-<p>As Ranma and Kasumi got ready for class, they both thought about the conversation they had with their friends. Such a harsh life with so little to be happy about. They deserved a break and a child would illuminate their lives and give them a new meaning now that they were out of their engagements. The Todos would eventually accept whatever their friends decided, but a little encouragement wouldn't hurt. Besides, those two needed some peace badly, and they wouldn't get it if they didn't feel like it was the best choice.<p>Ranma got up, clad in his practice clothes, and opened the door for his wife. He smiled as she walked past him and caressed his cheek. Talking their friends into having a son had also reassured them about having another child. Shocking the thought out of his head for the moment, he followed his love outside and made his way to the dojo. They were about to enter when a familiar voice called them from behind. "Hey guys."<p>They both turned with smiles on their faces. "What's up, Nabiki?"<p>Nabiki smiled. "I came to hear the whole story like Kuno did. You're not getting out of it this time." She said waving a finger at the both of them.<p>Ranma chuckled while Kasumi smiled faintly and shook her head. "Fine. Just wait till class is over. It's a long story and we won't be able to even tell you about the first year before everyone arrives." Said the black-haired woman.<p>Nabiki nodded and turned to see the first of the students arriving for the day's class. It was still a surprise to her that so many people from Furinkan wanted to learn martial arts. Akane and Ranma had been attending for a while and the Tendo Dojo never had any students, but now that Ranma and Kasumi taught it was packed. Maybe it had something to do with the style. The Anything Goes was very aggressive and depended mostly on speed, except for Akane, while the TodohRyu Kobojutsu was passive and designed mostly for defense. Even Kasumi's branch, which was the offensive one according to the students, required patience and for the opponent to attack.<p>Most of the students had already arrived, and they were about to get into the building, when a ragged figure placed foot into the Todo grounds. "Where is the Todo Dojo?" He asked as one of the students. He didn't take long to see Ranma standing on the steps to the Dojo. "RANMA, PREPARE TO DIE!" He bellowed his familiar war cry as he dropped his backpack and readied his umbrella.<p>Ranma sighed and asked before Ryoga could attack him. "What is it now, Ryoga?"<p>"BECAUSE OF YOU, I'VE SEEN HELL!"<p>The pigtailed martial artist wanted to yawn and turn around. It had gotten boring after the first couple of times. "Ryoga, you have no idea what hell is like. You simply blame me for your frustrations."<p>The bandana-clad fighter stopped his ranting as his eyes focused on the woman by Ranma's side. She fit the description given to him with incredible clarity. "YOU!" He yelled as he charged Kasumi.<p>The students and Nabiki watched in shock as Ryoga attacked the little woman. Ryoga's strength was something to really be afraid of, and he was directing all his anger towards her. Ryoga came close, so very close, to reaching his target when he felt the air leave his lungs. He flew backwards and landed on his back coughing as he clutched his midsection. His eyes looking directly at the attacker with hatred.<p>Everyone watched in shock as suddenly a huge man appeared out of nowhere and kicked Ryoga with enough force to take him down. He was very exotic looking, though that would call attention anywhere but in Nerima. Here people found all those looks normal. What they were more impressed with was the fact that Ryoga was still trying to get up. "You...b...bastard!" Ryoga stammered out as he managed to stand, though a little shakily.<p>"Look who's talking." Ranma said sarcastically. "You attacked a woman without even stating the reason. Where's your honor, Hibiki?"<p>Ryoga's face turned red with anger. "Don't talk about honor, Ranma. You know very well that you don't have a right to do so. And I attacked her because of what she did to Akane." He felt the little guilt he had felt at the accusation lift from his shoulders.<p>Kasumi stepped forward and said in an even voice. "Akane Tendo challenged this Dojo and lost in a duel of honor. She got hurt because of her pride and stubbornness. Your claim on me has no founding. I ask you to leave, we have a class to teach." She was being very formal towards someone that she disliked from before even knowing. Now that she did, she went as far as saying she felt repulsed by him. *He's nothing but a delusional brat.*<p>Kasumi's words were blocked by the rage of remembering Akane's tears. "Ranma, you honor-less coward. Face me like a man."<p>Ranma sighed and explained as if talking to a six-year-old. "I don't want to fight you anymore Ryoga. I'll only give you more reasons to hate me. Go to Akane. She's free from the engagement and will need a friend."<p>Ryoga spoke as if Ranma had never done so. "Ranma, I once told you I would destroy your happiness." He turned with a look of pure hatred towards Kasumi. It was very clear what he had in mind if he got the chance.<p>Ranma glared at the lost boy and started to advance when a deep male voice sounded. "Let me take care of this, Todo. I have to earn my stay around here." The pigtailed martial artist and Kasumi turned to their friend as he directed them a smirk. "Besides, you have a class to attend to."<p>Kasumi and Ranma looked at each other as if to consider the offer. The black-haired woman turned back to the smirking man and said. "Just don't kill him. And you'll clean the mess when you're done." With that, Ryoga saw as Ranma and Kasumi turned around and started up the steps to enter the Dojo. He cried for them to stop, but they paid him no heed. He tried to follow, but the mysterious man blocked his path. All the other students started to turn as well, and the lost boy saw as everyone disappeared into the wooden building. Only Nabiki, himself and the man remained outside.<p>"Get out of my way!" Ryoga said as he assumed his fighting stance. He was itching to give this guy some payback for the kick he managed to land earlier.<p>The man smiled as he had the hands on his pockets. "Sugu raku ni shiteyaru." He then fell back on his own fighting stance. The condescending smirk never leaving his features.<p>END PART 4<p>Author's notes: Man, I'd hate to be one of my readers. If there's anyone out there that writes fanfiction and likes to give us cliffhangers, consider this my revenge. (Cavernous laugh.) Another chapter out, and hopefully more to come. I've been working on all of my fics this week, and hope to have something else up soon. Anyway, next chapter will cover the fight and I'm finally starting with the flashbacks. I can't back down now, Nabiki is interested and you know what that means.<p>I also wanted to thank RedPriest17 for his support and ideas. He's actually the one that inspired me to go with my nature and write a videogame fanfic. 'You out there? Thanks man!'<p>Until next time. See you in Part 5!
