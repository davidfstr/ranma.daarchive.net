</div>Nabiki tiredly closed the gate of her house. It had been a long day. They had spent nearly every minute with one of her contacts in the government registry creating records of one Kasumi Todo and one Yoko Todo, as well as modifying Ranma's record. The marriage certificate and birth certificate were the most difficult to create. *And expensive as hell.* She thought as she remembered the insane amounts of money required for the right people to look in the opposite direction. In the end, it was worth it. Nabiki was the best when it came to this kind of business, and it would be easier to stop Happosai from groping girls than identifying those records as false. They were safe in that aspect.<p>After that the Todos booked in a hotel for the night and would start hunting for a house first thing in the morning. When the middle Tendo sister saw them last, Kasumi had started crying again for the same reason she cried almost the entire day. Ranma's eyes watered as well, but either way he smiled at her and thanked her for everything. Nabiki felt full of something she couldn't identify. "Why did I help them?" Was a question that had been repeating itself in her mind. Why had she inverted such ridiculously huge amounts of yen to help a man that had hurt her sister and family?<p>She couldn't reflect on that any longer as her own musings called the attention of the household. No sooner had she spoken when her family and Genma were bombarding her with questions as to what happened. Genma and Soun were frantically asking about where Ranma was so that they could conduct the wedding. Akane had her mallet in her hands and looked about ready to use it on someone. Nabiki hoped that someone was Ranma. Kasumi looked at her calmly, which was the most you could get out of her.<p>Nabiki would have laughed at the situation if she didn't feel the beginnings of a headache. This scene was so much like the one in the Saotome's living room after Ranma's revelation. Well, she would remain her usual self. "Get in and I will explain things. It will even be for free if you don't interrupt me." She smirked as they all entered the house silently and waited patiently for her to join. *Are they predictable.* She thought sarcastically.<p>Nabiki sat down and studied each person carefully.<p>Akane was angry and a little scared, which made her angrier. She was obviously worried about Ranma, though for some reason her mind had reached the conclusion that this was Ranma's fault. How she could love the man and don't trust him was beyond Nabiki. Akane would be hurt over this, but the marriage between Ranma and her was doomed to fail.<p>Soun looked at her expectantly, tears in the corners of his eyes. He had been serious when he said Ranma and Akane were marrying today. This had become a compulsive behavior that would need professional help. The Tendo father wanted the schools to be united no matter what the consequences were.<p>Genma was shifting in his seat. He was impatient and wanted to know where Ranma was to collect the boy and force him to marry Akane. He should be a good son and follow his father's commands. It was what honor demanded.<p>Kasumi patiently waited for Nabiki to start with the explanation. The middle Tendo sister said she would explain things, so that was enough for her. There was a silent concern in her eyes, probably for the well being of her father and sister. Even though everybody saw Kasumi as the sweetest creature of creation, Nabiki knew better. The eldest Tendo sister was extremely cold hearted with anyone that hurt her family, even if she didn't directly express it. Nabiki was a little scared of Kasumi, though she would never accept it.<p>Taking a deep breath, mostly to gather her thoughts and think of the better way to break the news to the family, Nabiki started. "You will have trouble believing what I'm about to tell you. I wouldn't believe it if it weren't because I was there. I don't know the exact details and Ranma said he would fill me in once he understood what happened clearly. But this is mostly it." Nabiki decided to be blunt and say things outright. No use in letting her sister and father jump to conclusions in the middle of her explanation. "The woman and girl that were found with Ranma are not estrangers. That magical explosion somehow sent Ranma to another world for sixteen years. In that time he married and had a daughter."<p>"You mean...?" Kasumi started to ask.<p>Nabiki nodded. "Yes. The woman and girl are Ranma's family. Ranma is actually 34 years old."<p>"I DON'T BELIEVE IT! AND I WON'T ALLOW IT!" Soun bellowed as he stood up. Nabiki had expected for the usual Tendo waterworks, but this rage was different. It was almost like Akane.<p>Genma stood up solemnly. "I won't allow my son to dishonor the Saotome name with that whore."<p>Akane mutely left the room, her expression completely devoid of emotion. Kasumi frowned slightly and followed her younger sister.<p>Nabiki had to admit that Nodoka took things a lot better. Good thing Ranma wasn't here, or he would have physically demonstrated why he wouldn't let anybody get between he and his family. Nodoka demanded an explanation. Genma and Soun openly insulted Kasumi. Both parents turned to her. "Where is that ungrateful son of mine?"<p>Nabiki calmly crossed her arms. "Ranma left the Saotome house late in the afternoon after having a fight with Auntie Nodoka. He's no longer a Saotome and hasn't practiced Anything Goes for more than ten years." *That should stop them from their stupid plans.* She thought as she left the room. She needed to have some rest if she was going to help the Todos find a place to live.<p>-<p>Early in the morning the next day was a surprise for Nabiki. She left even before her sister got up to make breakfast, a pack of Ranma's clothing over one shoulder. When she arrived at the hotel, which was very close to the area of the Tendo Dojo, she noticed a peace that never accompanied the places Ranma lived in. She took out the key to the room and opened the door. The scene was worth a picture, too bad she had promised none of that. Ranma slept peacefully facedown, Yoko had her little arms wrapped around his neck as she slept over his back just as deeply as her father did. Nabiki always had envy of the ease with which the Saotomes could just lay down and sleep through the end of the world.<p>A sound from the other side of the room got Nabiki out of her contemplative mood. "Konichiwa, Nabiki-san." Kasumi was wrapped in a towel as she exited the bathroom. Nabiki was still amazed a woman could be so slender even after giving birth.<p>"Call me Nabiki." She took the backpack and gave it to the smaller woman. "I packed some of Ranma's clothes there. There are several things we bought for his female form that should fit you too." After all Ranma's girl form was the smallest girl around. Kasumi not included.<p>Kasumi took the pack and smiled. "Arigato. I'll love to see his face when he notices what I'm wearing." She turned a little hopeful. "Is there by any chance a kimono in there?"<p>Nabiki nodded. Even if Ranma had never wore it because he hated it from the beginning, they had bought a kimono for his cursed form as well. "Do they always sleep like that?"<p>The black-haired woman nodded. "From our wedding night till now I can't remember a day in which Ranma woke up before I did. It seems like Yoko is like him in that way." As Kasumi entered the bathroom again Nabiki wondered what kind of woman Ranma had married.<p>A few minutes later Kasumi emerged from changing. She was dressed in an immaculate kimono with her hair down the same way as yesterday. "It looks great on you, love." Ranma said from his the bed.<p>Both women directed him accusing stares. "How long have you been up?" Asked Kasumi.<p>Ranma smiled at his wife. "From the time Nabiki opened the door. I just didn't want to wake Yoko."<p>Kasumi put her hands on her hips. "Don't spoil her, Ranma. She has to get up." And in so saying she took her daughter in her arms and started to wake her up. "Yoko. Wake up, Yoko."<p>The little girl opened her eyes sleepily, turned all around and went back to sleep. Kasumi rolled her eyes as Nabiki grinned. "The girl definitely takes after Ranma."<p>The new voice seemed to wake the sleepy girl as she turned to Nabiki very quickly. She regarded the estranger with curiosity. Ranma smiled as he got up. "Yup, say hi to your aunt Nabiki."<p>The girl smiled happily as she waved a hand cheerfully. "Hi, Aunt Biki!"<p>Nabiki was taken by surprise, not expecting such a reaction from the child. In fact she had little experience with little kids. She turned to ask Ranma what he meant with that Aunt thing when she noticed something on his chest. He had four parallel scars going from his upper torso to his middle abdomen. The marks were too imprecise to be made with a blade. "What happened?" She asked after a few seconds.<p>Ranma shrugged. "A fight with some guy before I met Kasumi. It was quite weird too because the guy used to hate violence, and he himself was the most savage fighter I've ever seen." He didn't seem to give the matter much importance.<p>Kasumi changed the subject after the following silence prolonged for several seconds. "Anata, could you bath Yoko. I'll go get something for breakfast."<p>Yoko seemed to love the idea as she extended her arms for Ranma to carry her. He smiled as he did so and said. "Be done when you're back." And with that he entered the bathroom.<p>Nabiki stared at the door through which Ranma left the room. She was so unprepared for this Ranma. A father, a husband. She was used to the arrogant boy that always kept up the macho act. "Nabiki, would you like to come with me?" Kasumi got her out of her reverie. The middle Tendo sister nodded and both women left to get some food.<p>-<p>"Ahhhhhhhhh. That hit the spot." Ranma said as he patted his belly. He laughed as Yoko imitated his gesture. Kasumi simply shook her head, knowing the futility of scolding her daughter. Breakfast consisted of some miso soup. After eating with the usual Saotome gusto, Ranma placed his now empty bowl in the thrash can and got up. "Well, we should start looking around."<p>Nabiki grinned as she too got up. "You haven't changed so much, Todo. Your eating manners still suck." She was a little disappointed as Ranma didn't argue the point. He was so much more capable of accepting criticism now.<p>The entire morning was spent looking around some places that might interest the couple. They coursed through most of the Nerima district without much luck. Most of the places were either too small or too expensive. Nabiki was even starting to get impatient at their lack of success. They stopped to have something to eat and continued with their search. Nabiki was about to call it a day when Ranma spotted something that caught his interest. "What about that place?" He asked pointing to a fairly large piece of ground. A small run down house was in the middle. It seemed like no one had been there for ages.<p>Nabiki shook her head. "It's too old to be safe. Besides, the sign says it's for sale, not rent."<p>Kasumi eyed the grounds with a careful eye, and said. "We could at least ask how much they want for it."<p>Nabiki sighed, but either way tried to decipher what the number was. They went to a small coffee shop to have a rest and let Nabiki make the phone call. Yoko was already falling asleep after spending the whole day walking around. Their burns were still weakening them and she was the smallest one. Nabiki returned with a look of disbelief on her features. "The house has been for sale for more than twenty five years. The owner doesn't ask that much for it." She still couldn't believe it. Some of the small apartments they had seen would cover the price she was asked for in rent in three years. She couldn't believe she hadn't seen that old house before. It seemed like everybody simply didn't consider it because of the run down state it was in. "The work force needed to make repairs will be expensive, but not anything that surpasses the daily needs of the Dojo."<p>Ranma shook his head. "Don't worry about it, Nabiki. We'll take care of repairing the place. We just need the tools and materials." At Nabiki's lifted eyebrow he explained. "I took carpentry as a hobby from a friend." He frowned as he continued. "Are you sure you are willing to buy a house for us? It will be very expensive."<p>Nabiki didn't want to tell Ranma that from his stay in the Tendo Dojo alone she had acquired quite a big sum of money, which she had invested in the stock market with care and made a small fortune. She had enough to pay for her and Akane's college with a rented house for them to live in their entire careers. Of course, she didn't know why she was going to such lengths in helping someone that would probably never be able to pay back, but she had a feeling things would be fine. "Just pay me back and we'll call it even." Kasumi nodded and smiled at her.<p>-<p>Ranma and Kasumi were once again surprised with Nabiki as she had the documents ready to sign early the next day. The middle Tendo sister was completely in her element. Nabiki for her part was a little surprised when Ranma asked her to put the house under Kasumi's name. When he explained his reasons though, it made sense.<p>"She doesn't have any kind of ties in this world, while Genma got me into a heap of trouble. Even if I'm no longer a Saotome we don't know what he has done." He smiled fondly as Kasumi scolded Yoko for practicing some rolling maneuvers in the mud. Those stains wouldn't come out easily. "Besides, I'm the one who married into the clan."<p>And so it happened. The transfer was made and Nabiki closed the biggest deal of her young life. She had even added a small bank account for the expenses of the repairs. Now it was her turn to make plans. Ranma and Kasumi kept working on the house the entire day, which allowed Nabiki to go to school and plan how she intended to collect from them. She had no delusions about being paid if she didn't move on her own. Ranma may have changed, but he still didn't seem to have any commercial skills. Kasumi seemed like the traditional Japanese wife that remained at home the entire day. She had invested a lot of money on them, now she wanted to start seeing the results. She left the couple for a week, since they wouldn't be going anywhere, and readied some plans she had had for Ranma when he married Akane. She sighed. *It will have to be now.* Of course, going to school was a very gratifying experience. Everyone wanted to know what happened to Ranma, which of course meant easy yen as<br/>she answered questions without giving out too much. She did say that Ranma was now married and had a daughter, but that was mostly it. To avoid questions about his whereabouts, Nabiki simply asked for exorbitant amounts of yen. Not even the Kunos paid that much for information.<p>After this happened, Furinkan High declared Ranma season. Everyone spent their afternoons looking for the pigtailed boy, eager to satisfy their curiosity. The rivals and fiancées looked everywhere as if their lives depended on it. Genma and Soun had started to go out to supposedly drink. Nabiki knew better.<p>-<p>Of all the people looking for the martial artist, only two got lucky in the third day of watch. Two students discovered Ranma as he walked down the street with a lot of wood beams over his back. The sight was normal for Nerima, but in any other part of the world people would have been shocked to see a man carry that much weight. They followed Ranma to the new Todo house, which was looking as good as new. There were large quantities of wood piled up next to the house. Kasumi emerged from the house looking very tired and smiled at her husband. They kissed briefly and went over to the open space where Ranma dropped the wood.<p>The two boys watched intently as Ranma and Kasumi started to cut the wood and generally work on the structure of a small building. Deciding to confront Ranma, they both made their way to the working couple.<p>Ranma and Kasumi were both tired to the point of dropping dead, but either way continued working. The house had taken surprisingly little time to repair, particularly with Ranma's carpentry skills. Kasumi had taken the task of cleaning and working inside. Now the house was very presentable, if a bit bare inside for the lack of furniture. Didn't matter though, they could live in it as it was. Presently they were working on paying Nabiki back. Both knew that if they didn't take things in their own hands they would end up owing Nabiki for the rest of their lives, something neither wanted. Ranma had even started on his work again, eager to avoid a conflict with the Ice Queen of Furinkan High. As they worked with the wood they both heard the noises of steps as someone approached. Turning around quickly their fears of being found by one of the fiancées were squashed. Ranma smiled widely as he greeted the two boys. "Hey, guys! What's up?"<p>Sure enough, Hiroshi and Daisuke smiled as they waved and made their way to their friend. "What's up, Ranma?" Hiroshi greeted. He was shocked though, as he saw the changes Ranma had gone through. "Man. What happened to you?" Daisuke shared the same doubts and expression of shock.<p>Ranma and Kasumi exchanged a glance, knowing they would be repeating this story for quite some time.<p>-<p>"Man, and when you think you have seen it all." Said Daisuke as Ranma finished with the story. The story covered everything from Ranma's 'accident' to the present plans they had to pay Nabiki back.<p>"You need a hand to build it? We aren't experts but we'll do our best." Hisoshi offered.<p>Ranma smiled at both his friends. "You bet. We can always use a couple of hands more."<p>Kasumi smiled as she started walking to the house. "I'll get you something to drink. My husband is an implacable taskmaster."<p>Daisuke gulped but either way wanted to help Ranma. "Arigato, Todo-san."<p>Kasumi stopped and turned around with a frown. Daisuke gulped at the scowl. "Call me Kasumi. Do you want to make me feel old?" There was the smallest hint of a threat in her voice.<p>Of course, Hiroshi and Daisuke were old Nerima veterans, highly trained in detecting danger and avoiding trouble. "No, Kasumi." They both barked out. Kasumi smiled and walked into the house. They both turned to Ranma, who was chuckling as he hammered some nails. "What?"<p>The pigtailed man turned to them. "You don't know how close to dying you came. Kasumi can be very sensitive about her age."<p>The boys dismissed it as they smiled wickedly to each other and turned to Ranma. They started working as well as Ranma told each one what to do. "So, Ranma?" Hisoshi started. "Tell us about it, man."<p>"Yeah, don't leave anything out." Daisuke finished.<p>Ranma looked at them confused. "What are you talking about?"<p>"We're talking about the sex, man. This time you can't deny having done it. You already have a daughter."<p>The pigtailed man was taken aback by the statement and realized he had forgotten about this facet of his friends. Oh well, he had to take the good with the bad. "You do realize that if Kasumi hears about this you'll both be in serious trouble and I'll be dead." Both boys didn't relent, and Ranma sighed. "Fine, fine. I'll tell you as we work." They lifted one of the beams. "You know, it's simply impossible to describe. It's not the fact that we had sex, we made love. There's a difference between the two. I can honestly tell you that nothing you've heard compares to the real thing. It's something you'll simply have to experience on your own."<p>Hiroshi and Daisuke were a little disappointed at the explanation. They had been expecting an explanation of what had exactly happened, but Ranma gave them a sermon instead. They resigned themselves to it. There was nothing they could do about it. Kasumi returned minutes later and they all had some lemonade. After that, they resumed work and didn't stop until it was already getting dark.<p>"We'll be back tomorrow after school." Hisoshi said.<p>"There might be others who want to help out. What do we do about them?"<p>Ranma considered for a moment and answered. "Just don't tell anyone that might inform this to Nabiki or the fiancées."<p>Kasumi nodded. "And don't feel forced to help out. We both thank you, but don't want to impose on you."<p>Daisuke waved it off. "Don't worry. Ranma has helped all of us more than once. It was about time we could pay him back." And with that both boys left to have some dinner.<p>Kasumi turned to her husband. "You have good friends."<p>Ranma nodded. "Is Yoko still asleep? I can't believe that girl sleeps so much."<p>Kasumi lifted an eyebrow as they made their way to the house. "Look who's talking. At least she's still a child. You sleep a lot too and are a grown man."<p>"Hey!" A protest was heard as the door was closed. Soon night fell over Nerima, a night full of peace. And that was something the residents welcomed, since they had so little of it.<p>-<p>Nabiki woke up with a smile on her face. Today would be a profitable day. She had made a few calls, and there were several movie directors interested in Ranma's unique abilities to survive from dangerous situations. They were willing to pay a fortune for his services. It was a school free day, so she intended to head over to the Todo house and impose her plans on Ranma. The way he owed her he would be forced to oblige. Getting up and going through her usual routine, Nabiki sat down to have breakfast with her family. "Konichiwa." She greeted.<p>Out of everyone in the table, only Soun and Kasumi answered. It was obvious that Akane and Genma resented her for keeping Ranma's whereabouts from them. Breakfast went pretty normal for the most part. "There's a new dojo opening today." Soun said from behind the newspaper.<p>Kasumi and Genma didn't react to the announcement. Akane frowned, considering it an insult that someone would be arrogant enough to think he could teach anything to martial artists in Nerima. Nabiki didn't give it a second thought, since the Dojo wasn't getting any competition. Akane was the only one that trained there, and would probably continue that way.<p>Soun finished reading the paper and started a game of shogi with Genma. Kasumi started to clear the table when Nabiki's cup fell from her limp hand. It shattered on the table as the middle Tendo sister had an expression of complete shock on her face. The article in the newspaper had a picture in it, and she could recognize the house next to the new dojo. She didn't notice she had become the center of attention as she left the house in a hurry. Everyone else stared at the door after she ran out. Then, turning to where she had been sitting, they saw the paper. The page was the one of the new dojo. They decided to check that new dojo out, if it could get such a reaction from Nabiki.<p>-<p>Nabiki ran nonstop until she arrived at the Todo household. Sure enough, she found the same scene from the picture in front of her. There was a huge sign on the wood building that read "TODO DOJO" and several young people getting into it. Nabiki could do nothing but stare stupidly at it for several minutes. The dojo itself was bigger than the house, more than twice as big as the Tendo Dojo was. She couldn't believe it had been built in so little time, or that it already had so many students. Then she recognized some of the boys and girls present. Her eyes widened at the realization of what must have happened. Without another word she entered the building.<p>The sight inside was impressive. Dozens of students filed up already dressed to start with the first class. In front, two pyres blazed as the flames angrily rose, cracking with power. There were large kanjis that named the style practiced by the school. Nabiki was at awe at the place, as it emanated power and a feeling of camaraderie. Her attention was taken from the place as she noticed two people standing in front of everyone.<p>Ranma and Kasumi bowed to the class. They both wore attires very much like Kuno's with small differences. Kasumi wore a white and red headband to keep her fair from her face, her top was white and her pants were dark blue. She also wore some protectors on her arms. Ranma's top was also white, while his pants were orange with fire patterns on the legs at the height of the ankles. He wore no protection whatsoever and his hair was tied in his usual pigtail. They both emanated experience and authority, which reflected on the students as they stood solemnly waiting to be instructed.<p>Kasumi cleared her throat to get everyone's attention and started with. "Arigato. This Dojo wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for all of you." Some of the students waved it off with smiled on their faces. "Today we begin with your instruction in the TodohRyu Kobojutsu. You must all know that this martial art is primarily used for defense, but can be very damaging to your opponent. Try to avoid getting into a fight by all means necessary." The students in attendance nodded, understanding perfectly.<p>Ranma took the word. "There are two branches to the school. One is primarily focused on defense, while the other is a little more aggressive. We'll teach you the basics and you'll follow one of the branches according to your personal capabilities."<p>One of the students lifted her hand. Nabiki recognized her as one of her classmates. "Couldn't we learn both?"<p>Kasumi smiled. "Learning both is like mixing water and oil. You simply can't. Don't worry, we'll make sure you learn the one that better suits each one of you." She looked all around, smiling faintly as she recognized Nabiki. "Are there any other questions before we start with class?"<p>Several other students asked things about the training method, but that was lost on Nabiki. She was still entranced by the dojo itself. It seemed like she could see who were Ranma's real friends. It was obvious almost all of the present teens had helped with the construction for free. They had also introduced themselves to martial arts to help him out.<p>The class was about to begin when Nabiki recognized four people entering the dojo in awe. She cursed under her breath as she knew problems would start before she could get any bets.<p>Akane, Kasumi, Soun and Genma entered the dojo in shock. They had expected for it to be a small dojo like their own, not a gigantic building with more students than the Anything Goes had ever had. So entranced were they with the place that they didn't immediately noticed who one of the senseis was. The first to notice was actually Kasumi. "Oh my!" She exclaimed placing a hand over her mouth with the shock.<p>The others followed her gaze and had pretty much the same reaction. Anger. "RANMA!" Three voices yelled at once.<p>Ranma wasn't surprised as he turned to see the source of the interruption. He had been surprised none of this happened sooner. "I would like it if you didn't interrupt while we are in the middle of a class. If you didn't come to be taught I ask you to at least be quiet until we are done." He said calmly. The students were impressed by his self-control. Even after a whole week of working on the dojo with Ranma they still weren't used to this maturer version of the pigtailed martial artist.<p>The trio completely ignored his protest as they made their way to him. "You are returning with us now, boy. How dare you dishonor the Saotome name?"<p>Ranma frowned at his approaching father. "You've done a pretty good work of it by yourself, Saotome-san. And I don't have to answer to that, since my name is Todo." Genma would have lashed out at his son if it weren't for the fact that something in the other man's attitude told him he wouldn't hesitate to defend himself. The fact that he had called his own father 'Saotome-san' wasn't lost on him.<p>Akane didn't have such qualms. "HENTAI! How dare you cheat on me?"<p>Ranma's expression softened a little. "Akane. I remained faithful to you for three years. That's when I found out I wouldn't be coming back. As I gave you up I also gave up the Anything Goes and the Saotome name. We're here for a cruel turn of fate." His expression hardened again. "That I apologize to you doesn't mean you can come in here and insult us with your lack of self control or manners. For what I have done I have no regrets. Please wait till the end of the class for us to talk."<p>Akane heard everything Ranma said, each word adding to the fire that was her rage. "RANMA NO BAKA!" She cried as her mallet appeared on her hands.<p>"Stop!" A command was heard from the side. They turned to see Kasumi Todo, a frown on her features. "What do you think you're doing?" She eyed the mallet with distaste. "Such little self control speaks poorly of the Anything Goes. Leave. You've bothered us enough."<p>Soun started to prepare his Demon Head attack. "And who are you to order my daughter around?" He was becoming more angered with Ranma after his words, mostly because he was right. There was no way they could drag him with them because of honor.<p>Kasumi answered calmly. "I'm the owner of this dojo, Kasumi Todo. And I dare order you and your daughter to leave this place before I call the authorities to get you out."<p>The students were frozen in place at the confrontation taking place. Neither of them moved or dared take a breath in fear of directing the wrath of one of the martial artists towards them. Nabiki and Kasumi watched in fascination as no physical violence had taken place yet. It was completely new to them, knowing Akane.<p>Genma was still frozen in place, a victim to Ranma's penetrating glare. He felt like if he was staring at a cobra that might lash out at any second, with lethal results. All his life he had ordered Ranma around because he had taught the boy to depend on him, but something had changed. Ranma grew up, and he no longer seemed to want anything to do with Genma. And those eyes. He couldn't force his own to look away, while he desperately wanted to do so. He would still try to get Ranma to marry Akane, but it was obvious to him force wouldn't be the correct way to do it.<p>Akane stared at Ranma's wife with hatred. This was the woman that had taken him away. "I challenge you! If you lose Ranma belongs to me." She didn't notice how much like the other fiancées she sounded. She had always taken for granted that Ranma belonged to her.<p>Kasumi crossed her arms over her chest. "I refuse your challenge."<p>"What?" Asked Akane and Soun in shock.<p>Kasumi continued. "I don't own Ranma, so I can't accept a challenge where he's the price. Even if I did own him I wouldn't accept. He's too important to me to be risked over some stupid pride."<p>Kasumi didn't know how much these words hurt Akane. The martial artist wannabe had more than once accepted challenges like the one she made. And she realized she did it out of her pride as a martial artist, a very selfish reason. Then there was the fact that this person didn't seem to think of Ranma as hers by right, but by choice. This last part hit Akane where it hurt, because she realized she never really had Ranma as she believed. There was something in the way Ranma looked at Kasumi that wasn't there when he looked at any other woman. Akane came up with one of her usual comebacks when she was defeated. "You coward!"<p>Kasumi shook her head. "I won't take insult from someone so immature. Just leave and I'll forget your words." Akane stood tall in front of the smaller woman, trying to stare her down. Her anger only grew when Kasumi didn't react to her at all.<p>Akane was about to give up when an idea occurred to her. "I challenge you for the sign of your dojo." She smiled to herself with her genius. When she defeated this woman and took away the sign Ranma would be forced to come back crawling to them for food. She would then gain him back with her great cooking. It was perfect.<p>Kasumi heard the gasps from the students and knew she had to accept the challenge this time. "I accept your challenge."<p>-<p>The environment was silent as a tenebrous atmosphere covered the dojo. The students and witnesses to the challenge were kneeling on the walls to the sides and back, attentively watching. Ranma was on the front, a few meters in front of the two pyres, kneeling as well. His hands resting on his legs and his elbows apart from his body he presented an imposing sight. All the lighting came from the two pyres, so his features were obscured by monstrous shadows. His eyes were completely covered by the darkness and his expression was hard. "The fight will begin at my signal. The winner will be decided by either knockout or when someone can't stand up to continue."<p>Both combatants nodded. Akane assumed a highly offensive knife stance, concentrating on power over speed. She had a frown on her features. Kasumi assumed her own stance with a calm expression. Her left leg in front and the weight evenly shared on both. Her hands were in front of her at shoulder height with the elbows at ninety-degree angles. Her open palms faced each other.<p>The tension grew, if that was even possible, as they prepared to face each other. The only sounds registered were the cracking of the fire and the controlled breathing of the contenders.<p>Ranma looked at each of them. "Are you ready?" Seeing a small nod from both, he finally barked out. "BEGIN!"<p>END PART 2<p>Author's notes: Don't you hate it when someone does that? Sorry, couldn't help but stop here. And guess what? Next chapter will cover the fight and more of what Ranma and Kasumi have to face in their life in Nerima. Sorry for no flashbacks, but I couldn't find a place to place them.<p>Anyway, should I continue this? Send me your comments on it.<p>See you around!
