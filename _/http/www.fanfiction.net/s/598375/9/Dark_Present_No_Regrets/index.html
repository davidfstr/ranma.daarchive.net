</div>"Easy, girl." Rugal said with a smirk to his fuming teammate. Ranko still remained tense, prepared for anything. "Try to relax before the fights begin or you'll drain yourself." He was further amused by the murdering glare she gave him. "Fine, fine. Do whatever you want." He chuckled.<p>Ranko humped and turned back to watching the platform where the fights would take place. She had decided to ignore the big fool since she met with him. Not that she didn't respect him as a fighter, she had proof of his strength, but she found the man repulsive from the moment his gaze wandered down to her body. The lecher would be dead already if it was her decision alone.<p>Iori stood next to her, intent as well on the platform. "You'll get your shot at him." He said in his deep voice so only the red-haired girl would listen.<p>"We both will." They both remained there in complete silence, waiting for the matches to begin. Iori himself was tense in anticipation, though he did a better job of hiding it than Ranko.<p>Rugal sat back on a luxurious chair, being the sponsor sure had its benefits, and stared at their backs. *I must be seeing things.* He thought to himself. He knew Yagami was full of himself, and he suspected Ranko was the same way, yet both acted almost civil towards each other. Yagami had been a surprise addition to the team just three days ago, while Ranko had been introduced by Geese. Thinking back on it, Rugal wasn't sure he had heard Ranko's voice at all. And of course, never directed to him.<p>Further thoughts were interrupted as the announcer's voice was heard once again. The time had finally come.<p>-<p>Up on the platform the announcer smiled at the great audience formed. The Coliseum was full, and he knew many more were watching the fights at home. This tournament held a lot more attention than its predecessors. "Ladies and gentlemen! Get ready to see some serious fighting!" Cheers erupted from everywhere, the crowd excited beyond belief. "The first match is about to begin. Remember the fights won't have a time limit, so we'll be having a winner. Give a warm welcome to the WOMEN'S TEAM!" The crowd, if possible, cheered even more as Mai, King and Chizuru made their way to the platform.<p>"Good luck, Mai!" Andy called out. His wife gave him the 'V' sign as she stepped forward as the first participant for her team. Joe ruffled his friend's hair and teased him, which made Andy blush slightly. Terry just smiled at their antiques and turned his attention back to the platform.<p>"And now, their opponents for this first match..." The announcer said dramatically. "...the BOSS TEAM!" As soon as the words left his lips, everyone stopped what they were doing to see with dread as Krauser, Geese and Big made their way to the fighting area. A cold chill ran down Andy's spine when he saw Krauser would be the first participant to go against his wife.<p>When both participants were on the platform transparent walls of some reinforced material rose from the ground, completely enclosing the fighting area. Krauser smiled at this new facet of the tournament. No opponents would be running away from him.<p>Mai smiled at Krauser's confident smirk. "Don't think this will be easy." She threatened as she assumed her fighting stance.<p>Krauser chuckled as he stood straight. His massive body making him tower over the small ninja girl. "We will see, Shiranui Mai. We will see."<p>The announcer waited till they had traded pleasantries to start the bout. "READY, GO!" And the crowd went wild as the King of Fighters Tournament 2001 started.<p>Mai didn't waste any time in distancing herself from her opponent. She was well aware of Krauser's fighting prowess and knew she would have to be very careful. Just as she stopped retreating she noticed Krauser still had to make a move, as if he didn't consider her a serious threat. *Better that way.* Mai thought without feeling angry. She had learned through the years that having your opponent underestimate you wasn't a bad thing. Not by a long shot. "KACHOU SEN!" She cried as she threw one of her fans at her opponent, just to test the waters. She withdrew another one from the folds of her scant clothing and watched as her attack approached the Heir of Strolheim.<p>Krauser smirked as he saw his opponent throw such a weak attack. He held himself from bragging because he knew she was just getting a measure of him. *At least she's an experienced fighter.* He thought as he grabbed the weapon from the air and crushed it in his right fist.<p>They again squared off, none making a move to take the offensive. Krauser didn't want to finish with the fun too soon, while Mai tried to figure out what to do. One of Krauser's attacks was more than enough to kill a normal person. The crowd started becoming restless at the lack of action and made their opinion known.<p>Krauser and Mai ignored them as they continued to study each other. Suddenly Krauser grinned as his right hand started glowing. "BLITZ BALL!" He called as he threw a huge chi ball at his opponent. He followed the attack with a high jump to cut her escape route. If she wouldn't provide any entertainment then so be it.<p>Mai saw the attack coming and only one thought passed through her head. *DODGE!* She hastily obeyed her brain and jumped over the attack, only to receive a kick to the jaw for her efforts. She managed to roll with the fall, and safely away from the explosion of Krauser's chi blast. The transparent wall held the blast remarkably well and not even a scratch mark was visible.<p>Mai jumped back and away from a fist that would have caught her on the temple and just as she was about to reach the ground rebounded on the wall, evading another of Krauser's devastating blows.<p>Krauser smiled as Mai yet again managed to evade his attack. This time by rebounding off the wall. Just as he was recovering his balance he heard a voice behind him.<p>Mai saw Krauser taking a fraction of a second too long to recover from his attack and took advantage of it. "MUSASABI NO MAI!" She defied every physical law as she stopped her momentum in midair and reversed her direction, charging with her fans forward and crashing onto Krauser's back.<p>Krauser felt the blow and smiled. *I actually felt that.* He thought in amusement as he prepared to retaliate. It seemed like more and more fighters were becoming worthy of facing him. Not one of them could actually hope to win but a few, though. "BLITZ BALL!" He released his attack as soon as he turned around. To his surprise Mai was nowhere in sight.<p>Mai saw Krauser's hand glowing once again and rolled on the floor just as her opponent turned around. She congratulated herself for not receiving such an attack from point blank range. "CHOU HISSATSU SHINOBI BACHI!"<p>Everyone's eyes widened as they saw Mai engulfed in flames charge at Krauser's back. The impact resounded all over the place as the huge man fell to the ground smoking.<p>Mai took a step back and teased her opponent. "Hora, ganbatte!" Her smile fell from her face as Krauser effortlessly stood up, though.<p>Krauser felt his body burn from the powerful attack and smiled to himself. He stood up, unminding of the protests of his body. "You have some potential there." He said as he stretched his back, a series of audible pops were heard. "But you still have a long way to go." And with that he charged.<p>Mai barely had time to avoid the first couple of hits before she was mercilessly pummeled. She understood from the beginning she would need a great attack to take down Krauser, and she had landed such an attack. It wasn't enough.<p>By the time Krauser was done Andy needed to be held back by his brother. Promises of pain reached Krauser, yet he paid them no heed. He was impressed that even as he held Mai by the throat she would still stare defiantly at him. He hadn't seen such spirit but in a few people. "You fought well." And with that he punched her into unconsciousness. Mai's battered form fell unmoving to the ground, save for the steady rhythm of her breathing.<p>Krauser walked back to his corner, where his teammates waited for him, deep in thought. He had actually enjoyed that fight. He smiled, thinking back on what Geese had told him. It seemed like fighters around the world had indeed become stronger. He was looking forward to the rest of the fights, and most importantly, to facing opponents strong enough to defeat him.<p>Mai was quickly taken to the infirmary, though the medics told everyone not to worry, her condition wasn't in any way dangerous. As King stepped forward, another fight started. Krauser fought with abilities just a little above those of his opponent, intent on enjoying the moment.<p>Terry watched the fight as it progressed. He could see Krauser holding back, even though King managed to take him off-guard with some of her attacks. "He's stronger than before." Terry whispered.<p>"What?" Joe asked, though he was thinking the same thing.<p>"Krauser's stronger than before." Terry said aloud. "Mai's attack would have seriously hurt one of us, yet Krauser shrugged it off. He's grown even more powerful over the years."<p>Andy snorted. "So have we. I will be taking him down for what he did to Mai." He finished angrily.<p>Terry didn't tell him Krauser was careful when defeating Mai. A glance at Joe told him as much. The kick boxer had fought that monster before, and he knew perfectly what he would do when defeating an opponent.<p>Back on the platform Krauser was beginning to tire his opponent with his powerful attacks. King had to dodge most of them, and the strain was becoming evident in her slower moves. Though some of those were more a deception than anything else. The blonde woman was studying her opponent as they fought, and couldn't see a single opening. Not one she could take advantage of anyway.<p>From Krauser's corner a voice could be heard yelling at the Heir of Strolheim. "Finish it already. We have more important things to do than play with little girls."<p>Chizuru and King glared at Geese for that comment. He smirked back at them, daring them both to prove him wrong.<p>Krauser thought about it and had to agree. *They'll be a great challenge with more training. Maybe they need a little incentive to get it.* With that he increased the speed and strength of his attacks.<p>King was overwhelmed by the ferocious assault. Already tired from the fight, she lost in a matter of seconds.<p>When it was Chizuru's turn she fared no better. She managed to land a couple of blows with her illusions, but nothing that even slowed down the powerful fighter. As soon as he got a hand of her style he finished the fight as well.<p>The result of the fight. A slightly battered and burnt Wolfgang Krauser. Three very badly beaten girls.<p>"Took you long enough." Geese commented as he started walking towards their assigned resting area.<p>Mr. Big refrained from commenting on the fight. He knew he couldn't have done any better.<p>*************************************<p>"This Krauser guy sounds like a monster." Nabiki commented as Iori finished explaining the way the fight went.<p>Ranma nodded. "Uncle Wolfgang sure knew how to fight." He said nodding to himself. He stopped and noticed the startled looks everyone was giving him. Everyone but Kasumi, that is. "What?"<p>"Uncle Wolfgang?" More than one person asked.<p>Ranma just shrugged and turned to Iori. "Let's skip the idiot's fight. No use remembering about that self-centered brat."<p>Just as Iori nodded Cologne interrupted them. "What idiot?"<p>Ranma looked at her. "Just someone that fought with his team and won the first round. He was almost as delusional as Kuno used to be about his skill."<p>A massive groan was heard and the people from Nerima agreed to skip that part.<p>Leona broke the silence for the first time that night and started. "The next fight included Ranma's team. I was amazed at seeing his skill for the first time."<p>*******************************<p>"That was an spectacular victory from the HERO TEAM! Give them a round of applause." The announcer said just as Sie Kensou was taken out of the platform, completely unconscious. The crowd was cheering for Kyo as he stepped away, even if he didn't fight at all. Shingo and Benimaru exchanged a glance and shrugged.<p>After a couple of minutes the next fight was being announced. "For the third match today we have the 97' SPECIAL TEAM!" Cheering welcomed the entrance of Yamazaki to the fighting area. Most of the fighters were confused as to why he had so much support, since he was nothing but a sadistic bastard. "Their opponents for this fight are none others than the RUGAL TEAM!"<p>As the fighters approached, Ranko spoke directly to Rugal for the first time. "He's mine." She said seriously.<p>Rugal looked down at the small redhead and nodded. Even if he was blind he would have seen the hatred she had for the yakuza. "Have fun." He said with a smile. For some reason she couldn't understand, Ranko smiled back. Not a nice kind of smile, but a smile nonetheless. She nodded to him and received a pat on the shoulder by Iori as she got on the platform. Just as the walls started to raise her demeanor changed.<p>Yamazaki smirked at the small redhead giving him a cold glare. He licked his lips as he wondered if her hair was redder than her blood. Maybe her eyes weren't blue, he would have to find out.<p>Ranko stared at her opponent as she assumed her fighting stance. Her ire grew when she noticed the drool coming from his mouth. With impossible patience she waited for the fight to begin. "READY, GO!" And lunged forward at him.<p>Yamazaki blinked at the speed his opponent had. That was a mistake as she got into his defenses and punched him in the jaw with an uppercut. *Pathetic.* He thought as hardly felt the blow. He raised his knee and connected with her midsection, sending her flying back.<p>"She's toast." Joe said as he studied the way the fight went. This Ranko Howard was incredibly fast, maybe even faster than Chris, but she had no power behind her blows. Yamazaki, after the first couple of clashes, dropped all pretenses of defending and started mercilessly pummeling on the small redhead.<p>Geese frowned at the way the fight went. "That stupid bitch." He growled. Krauser raised an eyebrow at that.<p>Rugal remained expressionless. He had thought this girl would be a decent fighter, yet it seemed like he would be fighting Yamazaki in a matter of seconds.<p>Iori smirked when he saw the one sided fight. *So that's her game.*<p>Yamazaki's expression turned even more demented, if possible, as he heard the girl moan in pain. He had hardly felt her blows during the fight, and did most of the damage. Right now the girl was trying to stand up after receiving a kick to the jaw. His right hand tightened his grip on his knife. *Time to see your blood.* He thought as he advanced purposely towards the staggering redhead.<p>Ranko saw Yamazaki coming and prepared herself. When Yamazaki took out his knife and slashed sideways she made her move. The yakuza was too concentrated on seeing her blood to notice her feet suddenly gaining strength and her stance shifting slightly.<p>A yowl of pain filled the coliseum and was followed by winces of pain from every male present. Most reflexively took their hands over a certain part of the human anatomy. For Ranko had redirected Yamazaki's thrust, with incredible grace and strength, directly into his groin. The tall man's features revealed a mask of pure suffering as his body was drained of all its strength.<p>Ranko impassively stared at him, at his eyes. Her blue orbs devoid of any sympathy she waited for his to focus enough on her, just to rejoice on his look when she viciously twisted the knife, causing more screams to leave his lips. "Do you like it?" She asked in an emotionless voice. "Feel what you've caused on so many people and die." She finished releasing her hold of the knife and taking a step back. Then, just as Yamazaki's knees hit the ground and he was toppling over, Ranko lashed out with a sideways palm strike that held all of her power, her hand cackling with dark energy.<p>The sound of broken bones was heard as the small redhead caved in the big man's sternum, breaking nearly every rib and puncturing several internal organs, particularly the heart. The crowd watched in horror as Yamazaki limply fell back and choked on his own blood. His expression shocked that such a little girl could kill him so viciously, yet showing so little emotion. He had one last conscious thought before passing out forever. *I'm in love.*<p>Ranko humped and turned around, walking to her corner to wait for the next bout. The paramedics arrived almost instantly, but it was futile. They took Yamazaki out of the Coliseum in a black plastic bag.<p>To say everyone was shocked would be the master of all understatements. The fighters stared wide eyed at the red-headed girl wondering how such a cute looking beauty could be so vicious.<p>Geese stood up, anger evident on his features. "Stupid girl! I told you not to kill him!" He yelled at her, shocking everyone. Geese was usually more collected than that.<p>Ranko looked at the crime-lord and snorted. "So what?"<p>Krauser smirked. "Quite a daughter you have there, brother. I like her already." The expression on Geese's face after that comment was priceless.<p>-<p>Back on the '97 team corner Mary turned to Billy. "I can't believe it!" She said in shock. Even if she dealt with some of the worst kind of criminals, she still couldn't help but shiver at the look on Ranko's eyes when she twisted that knife.<p>Billy shrugged. "Sooner or later someone would've killed that bastard. I'm just sorry it wasn't me." He said as he casually stepped forward, ready to face Yamazaki's executioner. As he advanced he gave a few practice swings with his pole.<p>Mary eyed Billy critically, wondering why he seemed so calm about fighting Ranko Howard. *Maybe they know each other.* Her brain offered. She was still in shock after Yamazaki's demise, so she wasn't really thinking straight.<p>That's how every other person reacted, more or less. They slowly began to make the connection that Billy, being Geese's personal bodyguard, would personally know Ranko.<p>Incredibly as the fighters stood forward to continue with the tournament, the section of the crowd that had been cheering for Yamazaki started calling out Ranko's name instead.<p>-<p>"Nice touch." Rugal said with a smirk to the small redhead as they waited for the next match to begin. He was quite surprised with the way she handled the fight, though she must have known Yamazaki's style of fighting from before to be so confident in risking everything during that knife attack. That question would be answered later.<p>Ranko nodded to Rugal. "Arigato." She answered. Maybe the guy wasn't such an asshole after all. Maybe.<p>Iori chuckled as Ranko stood next to him. "His expression was priceless."<p>Ranko smiled. "I'm done, now's your turn." She said turning her eyes towards the Hero Team. Iori followed her gaze and nodded with an evil smile, that would make Satan piss his pants, on his face.<p>She easily got on the platform to face against Billy.<p>-<p>Terry sat back as he studied 'Ranko.' *She doesn't show any signs of being even tired. That can only mean the beating she received was nothing to her.* His eyes turned to Geese Howard. *You trained her well, Geese.*<p>He ignored Andy's and Joe's ranting on how they needed to stop her. Even if he still was angry with Geese, Terry's revenge was over. Now he only wanted to grow through the fights, to set a new limit only to surpass it. *Just like you, my friend. What would the others say if they knew there's one person who completely defeated me?*<p>Putting all those thoughts aside, Terry Bogard prepared himself to face incredibly strong opponents. This tournament had just become more interesting.<p>END PART 9<p>Author's notes: What can I say? Expect more fighting in the next chapter. The fights are just starting, and some vendettas are going to be solved. Just maybe not in the way you think.<p>See you in part 10!
