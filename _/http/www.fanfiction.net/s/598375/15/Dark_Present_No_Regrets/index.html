</div>"Tadaima." Nabiki greeted as she entered the house. She closed the door behind her and took her shoes off.<p>"Konichiwa, Nabiki." Kasumi greeted as she walked into the room. "How was your day at school?" She asked pleasantly. Then she saw the blood staining the student's uniform. "What happened?" She asked as she hurriedly ushered the middle Tendo sister in and checked for any injuries.<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes. "I heard the sounds of fighting coming from the dojo."<p>Kasumi gave out a sigh of relief and nodded. "I'll get you something to wear while I wash your uniform."<p>Nabiki thought about it and nodded. "Let me go with you."<p>Kasumi gave Nabiki a robe she could wear, though it was a little small on her, and they both made their way out where Kasumi started working on washing off the bloodstains. "Where's everybody?" Nabiki asked after she got tired of the silence.<p>Kasumi smiled. "Mature took Rock and Yoko out to get some ice cream. Even if she denies it she really likes to pamper children. Iori and Leona went out to buy some clothes."<p>Nabiki nodded and yawned. She was still tired from staying up so late yesterday. Even after she arrived to the Tendo dojo she couldn't go to sleep thinking about all that was covered the previous night and all the questions that rose. Tendo Nabiki was a very curious person by nature, and she wouldn't rest until she had all the answers she wanted. "Kasumi, how did you meet Ranma?"<p>Kasumi paused a moment to think about it and sighed happily. "You probably won't believe me, but the first time I saw him I wanted to kill him."<p>"Really?" Nabiki asked dryly. *Has everyone that's met Ranma wanted to kill him?* She asked herself.<p>Kasumi didn't notice Nabiki's tone of voice and nodded as she smiled at the memory. "I had returned from a training trip, intent on finally avenging my dojo's honor against one man. He was a friend's brother and had defeated my father for some information..." She trailed off and shook her head. "Anyway, when I arrived and issued the challenge Ranma was there since he was friends with Ryo. Yuri, my friend, had a big crush on Ranma and so was obviously in the dojo as well."<p>"So what happened?" Nabiki asked.<p>Kasumi frowned. "Ryo beat me, just barely, but beat me either way. As I was about to get up I saw a hand offered to me. At first I thought it was Yuri, but looking up I lost myself in a pair of blue-gray eyes."<p>Nabiki chuckled. "That sounds like Ranma alright."<p>Kasumi nodded. "I took his hand and he pulled me up." She pouted. "And then the big jerk goes and opens his big mouth."<p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "What did he tell you? Something about women being weak, I take it?"<p>The black-haired woman shook her head. "By then he had learned not to underestimate women. What he said was 'You almost had him. Had you trained harder you would've won.'"<p>Nabiki looked confused. "And you got angry over that?"<p>Kasumi smiled as she stood up, Nabiki's uniform in her hands. "I had trained intensively for years, not even contacting my family and friends, to win that fight. I guess after losing any word would've made me angry." She said as she hung the wet uniform. "You will have to wait for a few hours for that to dry."<p>Nabiki nodded as she followed her host. "What happened then?"<p>"Ranma followed after me and eventually managed to cheer me up. Yuri wasn't very happy about his interest in me but since we were friends she helped as well. After that Yuri, Ranma, Ryo and me started hanging out together. It turned into a competition to earn Ranma's affections."<p>Nabiki shook her head. "Just as it did here. So when did he finally admit to being in love with you?"<p>Kasumi's expression turned sad at that, startling Nabiki. "After almost a year of fighting over him against Yuri and another girl something happened. Yuri was kidnapped by a practitioner of a very powerful form of karate, an evil man that had trained Ranma when he went looking for the fighter that defeated Iori. That monster wanted to turn Ranma into another thing like himself, someone that let his negative emotions rule over his actions and consume his soul." A tear made its way down her cheek. "We went after him and the bastard forced Ranma to fight him or he would kill Yuri. When Ranma didn't lose control over himself during the fight the man killed Yuri, Ryo went berserk and attacked him, but was knocked down easily. It was then that it happened. The demon threatened with killing me as well and Ranma gave himself to his evil side."<p>Nabiki patted the woman on the back and waited for her to continue. It was obvious the memories were hurting her, but since they were here and Ranma wasn't that bad then they had somehow gotten out of it.<p>Kasumi hugged herself and continued. "I was frightened by what happened next. Ranma's power was so dark I wanted to crawl into a corner and die. The demon gloated that he had succeeded, but Ranma argued back before performing the most devastating attack I have ever seen. The bastard that killed Yuri was killed instantly, and his soul sealed in hell for eternal suffering. After that Ranma turned to me and for a moment I thought he would attack me as well." She closed her eyes and shuddered. "I can still see him like that. Only once after that incident did he ever use that power again. His eyes were glowing blood red as he stared at me. I felt like he was stripping me of my soul by the evil emanating from his gaze. He walked towards me, ever so slowly that it seemed like an eternity. He eventually reached me and I tried to move, to run away from him, but my legs wouldn't respond."<p>Nabiki was starting to get worried. Kasumi was reliving that moment and her entire body was shaking in fear. Even after more than a decade since it happened she was still deeply affected by it. Probably a wound that would never heal.<p>Kasumi let out a long sigh and relaxed a little. "When he saw my reaction to him his expression turned sad. I could see his shoulders slumping as he turned around. I could tell, deep in my heart, that if I let him go then and there I would never see him again. I fought down the fear he caused in me with the fear of losing him and reached out with my hand." She opened her eyes, which were glazed over but clearing gradually as she spoke. "After that fight, after losing so much, he admitted to me that there never was a competition to begin with. That from the moment he saw me he knew I was the one." She chuckled without mirth. "I should have known that from before. I was the only one to know of his curse, or of his relation with Geese. He trusted me like he trusted no other, yet my jealousy blinded me from noticing it." She turned started walking into the house with Nabiki close behind. "Our friendship with Ryo was strained when we started seriously dating after Yuri's death. When we married and it was revealed that Ranma and Ranko Howard were one and the same Ryo promised to kill Ranma, accusing him of letting his sister die."<p>They entered the kitchen and Kasumi filled the kettle with water to prepare some tea. "Ranma really has a way of making enemies." Nabiki said trying to lighten the mood.<p>Kasumi absently nodded, still badly shaken from her trip down memory lane. "Nearly everyone we knew went after Ranma's blood in our wedding, when Geese's relationship with Ranma and Ranko was known. It was incredible that the friends Ranma and me made during our time dating were all somehow related to the King of Fighters tournament. I was disowned by my father that day."<p>"What? I thought you were born in the Todo clan." Nabiki said confused.<p>"I was. And after a couple of years something happened that convinced my father Ranma wasn't the monster he thought him to be. He accepted me back and, since I was the only heir to the family style, Ranma took the Todo name."<p>Nabiki shook her head at that. "And I thought Ranma's life was interesting here in Nerima." She said in wonder.<p>Kasumi smiled faintly. "You live through a lot in your life. That particular part of our lives was very hectic and, had it not been for Krauser-san, we wouldn't have come out as well as we did. After Yoko was born we settled down and lived in my family dojo, the most exciting events being the challenges from dojo raiders and people still after Ranma's blood."<p>They both saw Geese enter the house and head to the bathroom. He was grumbling to himself and favoring his left side slightly. Nabiki turned back to Kasumi, who was by now serving them both tea. "If you ever want to talk about this again, I'm here." She wasn't very good at giving support, but the smile Kasumi gave her after her comment told her she said the right thing.<p>-<p>Ranma was currently cleaning the blood from the floorboards. It was easier when done while it was still fresh and he needed to slowly cool down or he would be stiff like a board the next day. This fight had taken longer than he expected and Geese worked him up pretty well. They restricted themselves to normal moves and, as usual since their fight in the King of Fighters Tournament, the fight ended in a draw.<p>He was still sweating from the exertion of the fight as he fought a particularly large stain. He was taken out of his task when he felt a presence enter the dojo. He straightened as he saw on his ankles, his back to the entrance of the dojo. "What do you want, Tendo-san?" He asked. His tone of voice wasn't angry, but it wasn't friendly either.<p>"I want to talk to you, Ranma." A male voice was heard. A male voice that sounded commanding, as if the man felt he had the right to demand things of him.<p>Ranma stood up and turned around, his eyes boring into Tendo Soun's own. The Tendo patriarch was taken aback by the state Ranma was in. The pigtailed martial artist's face had several cuts that were still bleeding and some bruises that seemed rather painful. His white top was stained crimson and completely wet with sweat. "Let me get my wife, she's the head of this dojo." He said emphasizing the 'wife' part.<p>Soun frowned at Ranma's words. "I came to see 'you' for a man-to-man talk."<p>Ranma snorted. "You hardly qualify as a man in my book, Tendo-san." He said condescendingly.<p>Soun's fists clenched as he glared daggers at Ranma for the insult. "How dare you!" He said with barely contained fury. The beginning telltales of his Demon-head attack already forming.<p>The pigtailed martial artist smirked. "Tell me one reason why I should respect you. A cowardly shadow of a man that abandons his family to fend for themselves when they need him the most."<p>Soun clenched his teeth and restrained from physically attacking the man he still considered a boy without a backbone. He was angered the most because the accusation had the stench of truth in it. "And who are you to judge me?" He demanded. "A reckless boy that cares for no one but himself. A rurouni that has stained the honor of two families with his thoughtless actions."<p>"What are you talking about? Saotome Genma is the one that made all those agreements in the Saotome name, not me."<p>Soun smiled condescendingly back at Ranma. "It doesn't matter. You are the one that has the obligation to fulfill those agreements. You are the one forced to marry one of my daughters to unite the schools of Anything Goes."<p>Ranma snorted again. "To take over the schools, you mean. As far as I know there's not a suitable heir for the Tendo Ryuu."<p>"What?"<p>"It's too convenient, don't you think? You lack a proper heir, which is entirely your fault for not training Akane at all even in the basics of the Anything Goes, but when she married me I would take over an already dead school in a dojo used by one person. And not even seriously."<p>Soun had enough and released his most dreaded attack. "HOW DARE YOU INSULT MY BABY! ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO HER!" He was mildly disturbed when Ranma didn't react at all to his Demon-head attack.<p>Ranma looked bored at Soun but either way answered. "I'm only telling the truth. Now calm down or I will kick you out of this dojo." He said coldly.<p>Soun growled at this but did as he was told. He needed to convince Ranma of doing the right thing. "Have you no honor?" He asked knowing the boy would take the bait instantly. He was surprised when Ranma chuckled. "What?"<p>"Honor? Even after you all but ignored all the other engagements Genma made, which stained both the Saotome and Tendo honor, you speak of honor?"<p>The Tendo patriarch protested at that. "Our agreement is the only one that has any validity."<p>Ranma sighed and shook his head. "Why bother?" He muttered to himself, then looked up and saw blind determination in Soun's eyes. The man was dead set on seeing his plans come true. The pigtailed martial artist cleared his throat and said. "Look, Tendo-san. I love my wife and daughter above anything else. I'll do anything, and I mean 'anything', for them. If 'honor' demands that I leave them then screw honor. I was already cast out of the Saotome clan so your claim on me has no meaning. Even if it did my answer would be the same." He said as if explaining to a four year old. "Accept the fact that I won't marry any of your daughters." He was angry with the man for trying to force him away from his family, but was also tired of the meaningless fighting and wanted some peace.<p>Soun's jaw tightened. "You will marry Akane." He said. "Your honourless actions in marrying that woman and fathering that girl don't matter. You 'will' do what is right or..."<p>Ranma glared at the Tendo patriarch. "Is that a threat?" Soun remained silent and Ranma growled out. "Look, Tendo-san. I've gone easy on you since you did put up with me when I stayed at your house. But if you even think of harming Kasumi or Yoko I will kill you."<p>Sound sneered. "Is that a threat?" He mockingly mimicked Ranma.<p>The pigtailed martial artist shook his head. "I don't make threats." He then pointed towards the exit. "Leave. You are no longer welcome here and should you ever set foot on these grounds again you will regret it."<p>Soun had a condescending smile on his face as he turned around. "You 'will' marry Akane." He said as he walked out of the dojo.<p>Ranma was left seething in rage. Only because of Nabiki did he refrain from beating some sense into Soun. He turned back to the bloodstains on the floor and flared his battle aura. He needed to work off the anger his meeting with Soun generated.<p>-<p>Kasumi suddenly turned to the dojo, her expression turning to anger as she saw Soun walk out of their property.<p>Nabiki saw her father and turned to Kasumi. "I'm sorry."<p>The black-haired woman shook her head. "Don't apologize for his actions. You've done nothing but help us and we are the ones who should apologize for the friction this situation must cost you at home."<p>Nabiki waved it off. "It was bound to happen sooner or later. They have to learn the world doesn't revolve around little princess Akane and their samurai world."<p>Kasumi nodded. "I have to go with my husband. Do you mind being left alone?"<p>Nabiki shook her head. "Go ahead."<p>Kasumi made her way to the dojo, leaving Nabiki to sit back and go over what Ranma's wife told her, as well as what must have happened between Soun and Ranma. She was startled out of her thoughts by a male voice behind her. "So you are Nabiki."<p>END PART 15<p>Author's notes: A decidedly short chapter, and late as hell! Sorry about the long wait. I cut this chapter here to post something and let you guys know I'm still alive.<p>Real life has been hell for the past month, but it seems like it will ease up a little, giving me actual free time to write. Also, I've been working on other projects with my free time, which you should be seeing later. I've got a fic I'm not sure whether to make a one-shot or not. If I do it requires some more time to be ready, if not then I should be posting several chapters in a row. You tell me.<p>Also, this chapter was intentionally written to leave a question out there.<p>Who was the man that trained Ranma and killed Yuri?<p>Well, that should do it. See you in Part 16!
