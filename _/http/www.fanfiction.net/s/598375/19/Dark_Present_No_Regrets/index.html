</div>"Ranma..." Akane whispered, her voice revealing just how hurt she was. All she could see was her fiancé, a man that had given away everything for her, openly showing his love for another woman. And love it was. The cat wasn't acting like it did once with her, being playful and affectionate.<p>Now the cat, Ranma, was acting in a serious manner. Concern and shame could be seen in the small redhead's inhuman eyes. And above all an emotion Akane so wished to see directed her way.<p>Love.<p>She didn't try to stop the tears. In fact she welcomed them instead of falling back into the anger that was her shield against the monster that haunted her so. A monster called reality. For the first time since she could remember she refused her anger and let her other emotions take over.<p>Kasumi Tendo's eyes narrowed dangerously when she saw her little sister break down and cry. She turned her gaze to Ranma and his wife. Those two were responsible for this. Nabiki had betrayed her own family. Akane would never be the same now. Soun was publicly humiliated and lost his right to teach the Anything Goes. The Dojo she grew up in, her family's legacy, was taken away by the women currently staining the wooden floor with their presence.<p>The eldest Tendo daughter stood up, leaving her father to recover alone, and silently walked to the sign of the Tendo Dojo. She picked it off the ground and turned to the blonde man that came with the pigtailed martial artist. She could recognize the authority in the man, so she addressed him even if he made her sick to her stomach. "Leave." She commanded as she threw the sign at the man in a show of disgust. "Never again step on Tendo grounds." She then turned to Kasumi. "Or stain them with your filthy blood."<p>The insult made Ranma's wife angry. Her bleeding wounds were the result of saving Akane's life after the Tendos used an honor less plan, and instead of the faintest gratitude she was insulted. Tendo Soun pressured Ranma to leave her by questioning his honor. And it was his family, except for Nabiki, that lacked all semblance of honor.<p>With a groan she stood up, pain flaring from her side, and used her right arm to support herself on Ranko. The redhead wouldn't allow a single soul close to her except for Yoko, and maybe Mature. Out of all the people Ranko knew, in the cat state the only ones she didn't attack were Kasumi, Lily, Mature and the children. That would be difficult since her wounds needed attention. Fighting down the nausea standing up produced, Kasumi looked at the eldest Tendo sister with a calm expression on her face. "Don't worry, Tendo-san. We won't darken your house anymore." With that said she started limping towards the exit.<p>On her way out she turned to Geese and nodded. She needed to get Ranko to the house as soon as possible. The older man would take care of Iori and Leona. Geese let her go, knowing nothing would come even close to harming her with Ranko in the Nekoken.<p>The blonde man, who so far had been silent, chuckled in Tendo Kasumi's face. To him her indignation and dark looks was nothing more than empty threats. His mirth only increased when he saw her expression darken even more. "Keep it up, girl. You're not the first one to go against us, and you won't be the first one to survive either." With that said he took the sign and started walking to the pile of rubble where Iori and Leona laid. It wouldn't be fun carrying them back to the house, but they sure as hell wouldn't be waking up anytime soon.<p>"Wait!" Soun's voice was heard as he struggled to get up. Geese turned to him with a raised eyebrow, wondering what the weakling wanted. To his surprise Soun succeeded in his attempt to get up, although unsteadily. The Tendo patriarch glared at the blonde man. "Tell Nabiki that she's no longer welcome in my house."<p>Geese's expression sobered instantly. "You would do that to your daughter over something only you are at fault?" He asked rhetorically. "The girl was right. You have no right to talk about honor or even call yourself a man."<p>Soun flushed with anger. "She's not my daughter! No daughter of mine would behave so dishonorably!"<p>Geese smirked in a patronizing kind of way that only served to further enrage Soun. "Let me get this straight. You accuse her of being dishonorable because she doesn't support her family in their 'honorable' quest to separate a man from his wife and daughter?" He snorted before turning to walk out. "I guess the girl was only partially right, then. You're not a man. You don't even deserve to be called a human being." And without turning he lifted the sign and continued. "If you want it back you'll have to enter the King of Fighters Tournament. It'll be part of the prize for the first place."<p>And after that he ignored the protests and insults coming from both Kasumi and Soun, as well as the sobs from the little spoiled brat. He reached the wall and examined the damage done to Iori and Leona. *They're going to hurt for a while.* He thought before picking them up and placing them over his shoulders. He was strong enough to carry their combined weight without much trouble, but keeping their limp bodies in place was the real challenge.<p>-<p>When Geese finally arrived to the house, an hour after the incident, he entered the living room and dropped both Leona and Iori on the floor. He needed to find his wife, since she was the more experienced with treating wounds. Iori wasn't too badly hurt, he'd just wake up with one hell of a headache, but Leona had lost a lot of blood even with the fact that he tied Iori's jacket around her wounded leg. Orochi blood or not she needed help to heal properly.<p>He ignored Nabiki, someone he had to talk to later, and walked down the hall. As he did so he noticed the drops of blood on the floor. They still weren't dry, which spoke volumes to him about the seriousness of Kasumi's wounds. It took her a long time to reach the house. He cursed Saotome Genma and the Tendos once again for their foolishness. Their plan was idiotic at best, and as a result three people close to him were badly wounded. They would surely pay. He was looking forward to the tournament, hoping to face Genma and Soun in the battlefield so he could rip their limbs off one at a time.<p>He finally reached the door to Ranma and Kasumi's room and instead of knocking just opened the door and walked in. This earned him a scowl from his wife, who was bandaging Kasumi's torso. For this, of course, the later had to be topless. It was sheer luck that the black-haired woman had her back to the door. "Haven't you heard of knocking?" Mature hissed acidly.<p>Geese ignored her tone of voice as he scanned the room for his heir. Sure enough he found her curled in a ball around a sleeping Yoko in one corner of the room. The redhead stared at him for a moment. When she decided he wasn't a threat, and as long as he didn't approach her mate or kitten he wasn't, she relaxed slightly. "How is she?" Geese asked concerning Kasumi when he saw Ranko was fine.<p>Mature placed a hand on a dozing Kasumi's shoulder to steady her before continuing to tighten the bandage. She wasn't surprised the younger woman didn't notice Geese's presence. When she arrived she was barely able to keep from collapsing. "She lost a lot of blood. Thankfully the wounds didn't reach the bone." When she was done she laid Kasumi on the futon for her to rest better. She was mostly asleep anyway. After that she took the medical kit, something she used far too often for her tastes, and followed her husband out of the room. From what Kasumi told her Leona and Iori would need her attention as well.<p>Inside the room the cat dragged her kitten next to her mate and curled next to them. After the nice lady finished healing her mate she finally allowed herself to relax completely, falling in a dreamless sleep.<p>-<p>Nabiki saw Geese enter the house and drop the unconscious forms of Iori and Leona. She was about to open her mouth to ask about what happened when he looked at her and walked off.<p>Usually Tendo Nabiki would follow and find out some answers, but after the morning's confrontation with her sister she had little desire to push her luck. Especially after Ranma nearly jumped her when she tried to help Kasumi. There was something about the cat state now that made a chill run down her spine.<p>So here she was. Alone in a room with two unconscious, and badly beaten, fighters that could each take out the entire Tendo household without breaking a sweat. She didn't even want to touch them for fear of aggravating their injuries, which seemed like they were inflicted by an animal. *Or rather by a human that thought he was an animal.* She thought.<p>She ran a hand over the bruise she had on her jaw and considered how much it would hurt if it was Ranma and not Akane that punched her. *He could probably rip my head off with a single punch.* The thought was not very reassuring. She really needed to thank Mature for shoving her out of the room before Ranma attacked her.<p>"We need to talk, Nabiki." Geese said as he entered the room. Mature walked past her husband and knelt next to Leona, whose injuries were more serious. She didn't seem to be paying attention to them, but Nabiki knew she was always very aware of her surroundings.<p>The middle Tendo sister didn't let Geese's tone of voice intimidate her. She suspected things were going to be bad for her. "Talk, then." She said as casually as she could.<p>Geese nodded as he knelt down on the floor and assumed a comfortable position. He told her all that happened in the Tendo Dojo, leaving out nothing.<p>As the story progressed Nabiki's features turned from calm to anger. Particularly when Geese told her of the Tendos' plot to get Ranko. She couldn't believe her older sister would be so callous with someone that saved Akane. But when Geese finished his tale, including Nabiki's banishment, the girl turned livid.<p>At first it was in shock, but that quickly led to an emotion her younger sister was well acquainted with. Anger. "HOW DARE HE?" She screeched as she jumped to her feet. She ignored the painful protests of her abused body and used that very same pain to further fuel and focus her anger. After the initial outburst Nabiki's anger turned into a focused rage. Her mind working as fast as possible looking at the situation from every angle.<p>Geese wasn't surprised at the sudden change in the girl's mood. As a matter of fact, he expected it. In someone like her, loyal to the point of stupidity, a betrayal had a very strong effect. After financially supporting her family for so long, a time when she had to forgo her own desires, being backstabbed like this was simply too much.<p>The crime lord kept to himself as Nabiki started pacing around the room, the pain of her injuries forgotten for the time being. Mature occasionally gazed at her as she tended to Leona's leg, which needed the most attention. She could partially understand what Nabiki was going through, but not as well as her husband could.<p>Finally, after five minutes of silence, Nabiki turned to Geese with her unemotional mask back on her face. "What are you doing with that?" She asked pointing at the sign of the Tendo Dojo.<p>Geese shrugged. "It'll be part of the first prize in the tournament. If I win I'll burn it in front of that weakling you call a father."<p>Nabiki frowned but remained silent. Geese couldn't tell the reason why she was angry. Probably because she wanted the sign destroyed and he was giving a chance for her father to take it back. Maybe it was the fact that Geese insulted Soun, though that was very doubtful. Could it be that Nabiki didn't want her family to enter the tournament and get killed in one of the first fights? Only Nabiki could tell.<p>Taking deep breaths to calm herself Nabiki sat next to Mature. She winced when she caught a glimpse of Leona's leg. The blue-haired woman wouldn't see action for a while with that wound. "Are you entering the tournament with Ranma and Iori?" Leona and Kasumi would need some time to heal from their current wounds.<p>Geese chuckled. "I'm not forming a team with the girl. We have a lot more fun fighting each other."<p>Mature rolled her eyes. "You mean beating each other to death."<p>Nabiki pressed on, ignoring Mature's barb. "Then who will be your teammates?"<p>Geese just gave her a smirk she recognized instantly. It was the very same she used when someone asked for information she wouldn't share. "Wait and see, girl. Wait and see."<p>"Will you tell the others of the fighters we've found so far?" Nabiki asked, changing the subject to distract herself from what happened at the Tendo Dojo. "If some of them are from your world they might be interested."<p>Mature raised an eyebrow at that and turned to Geese. "You've found others?"<p>Geese snorted. "Of course. I'd be a fool if I thought we were the only ones to make it." He turned to his wife. "But I'll let it be a surprise."<p>"Will you win?" Nabiki asked seriously. She knew Geese winning was probably the only chance she got at getting her hands on the sign of the Tendo Dojo. He owed her big, after all. That sign was more hers than it was Akane's or Soun's. While they had done nothing to keep the house afloat Nabiki had supported it with her resources. Resources that cost her a lot.<p>Geese sobered instantly at the question. He regarded Nabiki as he shook his head. "Not a chance in hell."<p>"What?" Nabiki blinked in surprise. Geese was very confident in his own strength. For him to admit not having a chance to win...<p>Mature instantly made the connection in her mind. "I take it 'he' is here?" Seeing her husband nod she returned to bandaging Leona's leg. Nabiki couldn't tell if the older woman was happy or upset at the information.<p>"Don't let anyone else know. As soon as they see him they'll know we are all going to lose. But if they know before the tournament they might form the teams to specifically fight against him." Geese warned.<p>Mature nodded, knowing her husband was right. The tournament would lose much of the challenge if one or two teams were too strong.<p>"Who are you talking about?" Nabiki asked.<p>She didn't press any further when silence was the only answer she got.<p>-<p>Mature was having tea early in the morning. So far she was the only one up, even though she was the last to go to sleep last night. She had decided to let everyone sleep in. Even her husband needed to rest after yesterday's events. She knew first-hand how draining it was to face against Ranma in the nekoken, even if you didn't actually engage the beast in combat. Everyone around the irate cat would tense in response to the dark aura she emitted, and the constant strain was like actually fighting to the limit.<p>It was fortunate that Ranko came home last night already calm. Mature would've been too tired to take care of Iori and Leona if she didn't. The only ones that didn't react that way were Kasumi and Yoko, but that was to be expected.<p>As she took another sip of her tea she considered what her husband told Nabiki yesterday. The girl was pretty much done with the Tendo name. Soun's declaration was as close to the banishment from the clan as it could get. What would she do now? Ranma and Kasumi would obviously try to get Nabiki adopted into the Todo clan. The girl had done so much it was the least they could do. But would Nabiki accept?<p>"Good morning." Came a female voice from behind her.<p>Far from being startled, she expected her to wake up before all the others, she started filling another cup of tea. "Good morning. Did you sleep well?"<p>Ranko walked past her and flopped down unceremoniously on the floor. She took the cup of tea and stared at the steaming liquid. "How badly did I hurt them this time?" She asked without meeting Mature's eyes.<p>The blonde woman sighed. "You can't keep blaming yourself every time this happens, Ranma. You know very well you're not in control when you enter the feral state."<p>The small redhead shrugged. "Still hurt them, though. So how bad?" She already knew even Kasumi ended up hurt this time, which added greatly to her guilt, but knew her wife would recover and have only small scars to remind her of the episode. She'd made sure of that before leaving the room with the still sleeping Kasumi and Yoko.<p>"Iori's nose is broken and he has a concussion. He should fully recover in a couple of days." Mature said calmly. "Leona has deep cuts on her torso and several of her ribs are badly bruised. Her leg was in such a bad shape she'd be crippled for life if not for the Orochi blood in her veins."<p>Ranko finally took a sip of her tea. "What about the master? And how did Kasumi end up wounded?"<p>The blonde answered without pause. "Geese didn't have to fight to submit you this time. As for Kasumi she got hurt saving one of the Tendos. Akane, I believe. No one else was hurt."<p>"Thanks, mother." Ranko said with a sigh.<p>Mature narrowed her eyes at the nickname. "Don't mention it, daughter." Seeing the redhead flinch was very satisfying. "Now I want you to forget that nonsense about all of it being your fault. As you can see no one was permanently hurt. Don't make me beat the guilt out of you." She threatened.<p>Ranko smiled faintly. "Yes, mother." Somehow Mature always found a way to cheer her up. Sure, she'd once in a while beat the redhead, but it was all in good fun. The reason why the cat didn't attack Mature was that she had never hurt Ranma the way it counted for him. Emotionally.<p>Mature let a small smile grace her lips. "Irreverent child. Help me with breakfast, daughter. There will be a lot of hungry people waking up in about an hour."<p>Ranko's smile widened at that.<p>-<p>He groaned as he sat up on his futon. He had to use his hands to steady himself, for the entire room seemed to be moving. *What happened?* He asked himself, wondering just who it was that he fought this time. Whenever he woke up like this he got carried away in a sparring match.<p>A moan from the side told him he wasn't alone in his suffering. "Leona?" He asked and instantly regretted it. The sound of his own voice made him all too aware of a splitting headache.<p>She hurt. Plain and simple she hurt. The fire of pain burned from her leg and chest. She answered the call of her lover with another moan as she tried to sit up. It was a hard thing to do, but she eventually managed to do it. When she turned to Iori she had to blink to make sure she wasn't seeing things. His face was one big bruise centered about his nose. She looked down to herself to find she was naked save for her panties. Bloody bandages covered her chest and leg. Oh well, at least the bleeding seemed to have stopped during the night.<p>Iori was similarly entranced on the state of Leona's injuries. So much that he almost missed her whispered words. "The nekoken." Then it all came crashing back at him. He remembered almost having submitted Ranko when she managed to disable both of them.<p>"At least we're here." He whispered as he started to get up.<p>-<p>"You will have to take care of the classes until Kasumi recovers." Mature said as both worked in the kitchen.<p>"I kinda figured that out." Ranko sourly answered. "So how did Nabiki take what happened?" She was sure the girl waited up for them to return, even if Tofu strongly recommended that she rest to recover from the blows Akane landed.<p>"She was shocked at first, especially after Geese told her Soun all but disowned her. But once she recovered her bearings she got angry."<p>Ranko blinked in shock at the news. "He disowned her?" Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "That bastard! How dare he do that to Nabiki? Especially after all she's done to keep 'his' house afloat."<p>Mature nodded. "That was Nabiki's reaction as well. When she asked about the sign of the Tendo Dojo I believe it was because she wanted it destroyed."<p>"Whatever happened to the sign?" Ranko asked, still trying to calm herself and failing. *How can that sorry excuse of a man do such a thing to Nabiki?*<p>"My husband has included it in the first prize for the tournament." Mature answered calmly. "He also gave the Tendos an invitation."<p>Ranko didn't have to be a genius to know why Geese did such a thing. He wanted a chance at them for what they did. "Well, it seems like we'll be entering the tournament, mother."<p>The statement made Mature blink. "We?"<p>Ranko nodded. "Kasumi and Leona won't recover in time for the tournament. The master already said he had his team ready. That only leaves you, Iori and me." She finished with a smirk.<p>"No." Mature whispered as she shook her head. "Oh no!" She said more forcefully. "There's no way you're making me team up with Yagami again. I remember quite clearly what happened last time I did." She started backing away as Ranko approached her. She knew what was coming.<p>"Please!" Ranko whined cutely as she hugged the blonde woman tightly. "Please, mommy! Can you join our team?" *There's no way I'm letting that sign go to anyone's hands but Nabiki's. She deserves it more than anyone else.* She thought as she continued to act cute and convince her 'mother' to help. She didn't really mind acting like this with Mature, since it was an effective way of annoying the hell out of the older woman. Besides the fact that she usually got what she wanted this way. Who would've thought that Mature had such a soft spot for her?<p>The blonde woman tried futilely to break the hug. She didn't try that hard, really, as the affectionate smile on her lips confirmed. It still amazed her that her husband's heir had such a profound effect on her. Not even her son could act like this and get what he wanted, yet Ranma always managed it. "I don't know." She tried, still struggling weakly but knowing the battle was already over.<p>Ranko inwardly smirked. *I got you.* She blinked and opened her eyes wide, if possible appearing even cuter than before. It was really quite surprising a woman her age could still act the part. "Please!" She whined again.<p>"Alright! Just cut it out, daughter." She was relieved when Ranko finally let go, though she could see the warm look the redhead was directing her way didn't go away immediately. They would usually only act this way when no one was looking, both would be too embarrassed if anyone else saw them acting as real mother and daughter. She shook her head to clear her mind. "You owe me." She said at long last. "Now go see if everyone's awake. Breakfast should be ready soon."<p>Ranko nodded. "Thanks, mom." She said casually as she kissed the blonde woman on the cheek. As soon as her actions registered in her mind she froze, wondering what possessed her to do such a thing. "Sorry." She said hurriedly as she rushed out of the kitchen. *WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?*<p>Mature was left frozen in place. Unbelieving of what Ranko just did as she touched her cheek with her hand.<p>END PART 19<p>Author's notes: The aftermath of the battle has brought some interesting consequences. Two of the fighters won't be ready in time for the tournament, so a new team is formed. What's happening between Ranko and Mature? And just who is Geese talking about when he refers to 'him'?
