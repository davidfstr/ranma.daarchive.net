</div>The Sun was about to set, turning the waters of the ocean into a raging inferno of crimson fire about to swallow the majestic sphere. The sound of the waves only added to the effect as they relentlessly crashed against the cliff that rose high above them.<p>On top of said cliff a human construction could be seen projecting long shadows. Movement could be detected from said construction, revealing the fact that some of the fighters had already arrived.<p>The three figures that walked towards said direction stopped to regard the magnificent sight.<p>"Geese still has a taste for the dramatic, I see." Iori commented, his eyes reflecting the light of the setting Sun.<p>Mature snorted but didn't contradict the red-haired man.<p>Standing in between them, Ranma fixed his gaze on the moving figures. "It seems like some people have already started to arrive."<p>"I'm almost certain all the teams will arrive tonight." Mature smirked as she started walking. "Let's join them. I'm curious to know who our opponents will be."<p>Ranma and Iori smirked as well and followed Geese Howard's wife up the cliff.<p>-<p>"How much longer before your heir arrives, Geese?"<p>Geese Howard smirked as he leaned back on his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. He didn't even try to hide his good mood. From the look of things the tournament would be a complete success. Knowing his empire would be reborn in this new world, with the support of his associates, had him very pleased. "It shouldn't be too long now. Knowing my wife they'll be here tonight."<p>"I still can't grow accustomed to the idea that you actually took the time to start a family." Another man said from across the table, which elicited a snort from the blonde crime lord.<p>They currently sat in a terrace that overlooked the entire place, giving them a good view of all the fighters that had arrived already. So far they weren't disappointed. This world's fighters were weaker than them, yet showed great potential. In a few years they'd probably reach a level close enough to the one of their world. They just needed to know there was someone stronger out there.<p>Geese's smile suddenly widened as he turned to look down the path that leads to this place. Just as his senses told him, he instantly caught sight of three figures making their way up the hill.<p>The other two men turned as well, following Geese's gaze. "There are five teams here already. How many did you invite to this tournament?"<p>Geese turned back to his teammate and smirked. "There will be twelve teams this year."<p>"A rather small number. I take it you had trouble finding worthwhile opponents?"<p>And so the conversation between Geese and his teammates continued.<p>-<p>When they reached their destination Ranma ignored his master's aura to study the fighters already here. Iori and Mature did likewise, wondering what they would be facing in the following days.<p>"Bogard." Iori muttered as he looked at the American fighter, who was standing across the room speaking with other familiar faces.<p>Ranma groaned when he recognized Yabuki Shingo. The guy had been a real pain in the neck until everybody found out Ranko Howard and Todo Ranma were the same person. After that he became an addition to the long list of people out for his blood.<p>And it seemed like he was in Bogard's team. *Just perfect.* He thought in annoyance.<p>Terry and Shingo were talking quietly to each other in a corner of the room, a Japanese woman with them. Every once in a while Terry would steal glances from Geese, but his demeanor wasn't at all aggressive.<p>The trio noticed the new arrival, but aside from Shingo leveling a glare at Ranma nothing happened. "He still likes you." Mature quipped from the side.<p>"Yeah, yeah..." Ranma muttered as he studied the remaining two teams.<p>"The Amazons are already here." The pigtailed martial artist said. "Wonder what kind of techniques they'll spring on us."<p>Mature snorted. "If they're anything like the girl that attacked Yoko then we shouldn't worry."<p>Ranma shook his head. "If they were sent by Cologne we should be careful. They might not be able to beat us, but the Amazons sure have a way to come up with interesting techniques." He rolled his eyes when Mature all but ignored him.<p>Iori gazed at the last team, which was huddled in a dark corner. *Never met them before.* Not surprising since he was from another world. He dismissed them and turned to see Geese was smirking down at them from the terrace, Wolfgang Krauser and Rugal Bernstein by his side.<p>Ranma and Mature were quick to notice the same thing. "Now we know why the master said he had his team ready." Ranma said as he started for the terrace, Iori and Mature close behind.<p>The three men stood up and pleasantries were exchanged. Even if they didn't know some of the others would be alive they knew each other well enough not to make a big deal out of it.<p>Ranma and Rugal glared at each other before shaking hands. "I can't say I'm glad to see you're alive." The pigtailed man said.<p>Rugal just smirked in return. "My sentiments exactly, girl." His smirk widened when he heard Ranma growl. The only person that could safely call Ranma that was Geese. Rugal's use of the nickname had caused countless fights between the two men that seemed to hate each other's guts.<p>Iori ignored the exchange, it happened every single time those two met, and turned to Krauser. "I take it your family is well?"<p>The German noble nodded. "Indeed. We have yet to know what happened, but it seems like most of us managed to survive."<p>This seemed to bring Ranma and Rugal out of their staring match, the older man turning to Geese. "Just how many of us are here, Geese? Your silence on the matter is starting to become irritating."<p>The blonde man, who took a moment to kiss his wife while the others met, sat down at the table and motioned for the others to do so as well. When they were all comfortable he answered Rugal's question. "The few fighters I managed to locate from our world were all invited to the tournament. Even if some won't participate, most of them will be here." His eyes turned to regard Terry Bogard, who as if feeling the gaze turned to meet Geese's eyes. "Take Mary Bogard for example. She was invited but won't participate."<p>Ranma perked up at that. "She's not participating? What happened to her?" He'd had his fair share of fights with Mary, and respected her as a good fighter and a passionate warrior.<p>Geese smirked. "Terry Bogard happened to her." When he noticed the confused glances directed his way he smirked and elaborated. "She's waiting for her third child, so is unable to participate in the tournament."<p>Krauser crossed his arms over his massive chest. "It's a shame. One less worthwhile opponent to face."<p>"Don't worry about it, uncle. We'll make up for it." Ranma said with a confident smirk. Krauser chuckled in amusement, but didn't argue the point.<p>And so night fell over the cliff. As the group continued talking the other teams arrived.<p>It amused Rugal to no end that the following three teams all glared at Ranma when they caught sight of him. Of course, the teams arriving had more than enough reasons to be angry with the pigtailed martial artist.<p>First were Akane, Genma and Soun. Then came Ukyo with her father and another grown man. The third team to arrive did so by air. Ranma needed to have a word with Nabiki about this one. The Phoenix people, lead by Kiima, all arrived and glared daggers at him. It was obvious they didn't come to fight to win the tournament.<p>The only reason none of the teams attacked Ranma on sight was the aura of danger that emanated from the group of people. None of the new arrivals knew this, of course. They convinced themselves they didn't want to attack Ranma yet, when in reality it was their instinct of self-preservation that stopped them from charging ahead with their revenge.<p>The night progressed and yet two other teams arrived. Ranma was the only person who recognized Herb, Mint and Lime. The Musk Prince nodded respectfully to him before leading his men outside. *Probably wants to keep those two out of trouble.* The pigtailed man thought in amusement, knowing Mint and Lime would make fools out of themselves in the presence of any woman.<p>The second team was known to all of them, though. "Billy!" Ranma greeted cheerfully as he caught sight of Billy, Vice and Chizuru.<p>Very soon nine people sat around the table, which barely had enough space for everyone. Several conversations took place amongst the fighters as they waited for the last two teams to arrive.<p>-<p>"Now is not the time, Tendo." Genma said seriously as he placed a hand over his friend's shoulder to restrain him. "We first need to get back your sign. Then we can think about taking the boy."<p>Soun didn't stop glaring at Ranma, who was currently laughing at something some gaijin said. "Your son has cost me a lot, Saotome. He must pay for all he's brought down on my family."<p>The situation of the Tendo Dojo was bad. Since Soun disowned Nabiki they'd had to sell a lot of things to keep food on the table. The Tendo patriarch blamed it all on Ranma, of course. It was him, after all, that should've taken over the dojo. Instead of that he betrayed Akane, turned his back on honor and disgraced the sacred halls of training of the Tendo legacy.<p>Akane ignored her father and Genma and turned to see Ranma talking animatedly with a blonde man. *She isn't here.* She thought angrily, having made sure Todo Kasumi was nowhere to be found. She wanted to fight Ranma's wife again, and show both her and Ranma what she was capable of. Thanks to her sister she'd be able to do it. Her hand unconsciously moved to touch her backpack, where she had the means to show Ranma what a mistake he'd done.<p>Unlike her father, who was convinced Ranma was the only person to blame here, Akane placed the blame on Ranma's wife. She was certain that once she showed to the world just how superior to that Todo woman she was Ranma would come to his senses. Genma and Soun had convinced her, with some help from Kasumi, that she needed to fight all out for her fiancé.<p>-<p>"What's the rush, Akira?" A man with a battle spatula tied to his back said to Ukyo's father. "We'll face them in the fights tomorrow, there's nothing we can do about it right now."<p>Ukyo looked at her uncle with obvious respect. He displayed a lot more self- control than her father. *And he's a hell of a better fighter too.* She thought with a faint smile. She'd never seen her family art used in such an effective manner before meeting her father's younger brother. The man was a like a force of nature.<p>Kuonji Akira sighed and turned to regard his brother for a moment. "You're right as usual, Jubei." He turned to see Ranma again. "Tomorrow." He whispered.<p>-<p>"So where's everybody, Geese?" Vice asked. "Aside from us fighters there's no one else."<p>"Indeed. How do you intend to make a profit if there are no spectators?" Krauser queried.<p>Geese smirked as he motioned towards the platform that would hold the fights. It was located nearly at the edge of the cliff. "This place is only for us fighters. And the doctors when they arrive tomorrow in the morning." He added as an afterthought. "I've seen to it that several secret cameras are placed to capture all the fights from different angles."<p>"Why not have an audience, boss?" Billy asked curiously. "You would've made a better profit that way."<p>Geese chuckled. "I would've. But we'll get enough from all the betting around the world. Nabiki has seen to that." Ranma smirked at the reference to Nabiki. She did have a way to set betting pools. Geese turned serious as he looked at each fighter directly in the eye. "This tournament won't be like the others. There won't be an audience we fight for." His eyes burned with an inner fire that was transmitted to the others as he got more excited, his heart beating faster as if he was facing an implacable opponent. "This time we fight for ourselves, to quench the thirst for battle we all share." He motioned for the platform once again, and this time the others found a lot more meaning in the gesture. "This time we come as warriors. The outside world will have no meaning once we step into that platform. Those who can't understand the true meaning behind this tournament are doomed to fail. This fight isn't about vengeance or about gaining power." He slammed his fist on the table, making everyone downstairs look at him and hear his next words. "This fight is only for warriors to test themselves against each other. Skill against skill. Strength against strength. Each and every confrontation will be fought as if it was the last. We're not here to win a tournament. That's a pathetic excuse." He clenched his fist in front of his face, his eyes focused on it. "We're here to fight."<p>Geese's final words had two meanings.<p>To those who didn't understand it sounded like he was simply repeating itself. He was stating something they already knew.<p>To those who understood the true meaning behind those words, it was enough to make their blood boil in anticipation. The wait for morning would be a long one.<p>-<p>"Nice speech." Rugal said mockingly after a few minutes of silent contemplation. Everyone knew it was only to keep appearances, though. All the fighters in the terrace were touched by Geese's message. "That almost sounds like the philosophy of 'you know who.'" The reference was not lost on anyone and they all nodded in agreement.<p>"I can't deny I've been a little influenced by 'him.'" Geese chuckled.<p>Ranma and Mature smirked but kept silent. *Let it be a surprise.* They both thought.<p>"So he's alive, then?" Chizuru wondered pensively. As if on cue they all suddenly turned towards the path leading up the cliff. "I guess that answers my question. He's still too far away to be seen, but there's no mistake about it."<p>"I really hope we don't have to face him in the first round." Billy groaned, remembering that's exactly what happened in last year's tournament. *Facing them at full strength is not something I want to do again.* He thought with a shudder.<p>-<p>"Do you feel that?" Shingo asked Terry, knowing full well he did. They were all currently looking down the path, having felt the monstrously strong chi that was approaching. His wife stood by his side, her expression unreadable as she waited for the man she both admired and hated the most.<p>Terry nodded with a smile on his lips. "He's here." He was glad his friend was alive.<p>-<p>Five minutes later everyone was looking towards the approaching three figures. Even those who didn't have their chi senses fully developed felt the aura's approach.<p>A man, a woman and a child. The aura they all felt at first was obviously coming from him, yet when they set their senses on the woman they were all surprised to find such a strong chi. They only missed it before because his aura overlapped hers by an enormous margin.<p>The trio walked into the building and headed towards Terry.<p>As they walked the man looked up and his eyes locked with another's. Blue met with red. There was a silent exchange between them that everybody else missed before they broke eye contact.<p>They were both glad to know the other was alive, since they didn't carry the burden alone.<p>-<p>The last team arrived an hour later. Ranma wasn't surprised to see Ryoga was a member of said team, but he did raise an eyebrow in surprise when he saw he teamed up with Pantyhose Taro and Kumon Ryu.<p>Once all the teams were present Geese welcomed them all and urged them to get some sleep in the rooms assigned for them.<p>Even the fighters who held a grudge with Ranma agreed that some rest was in order for tomorrow's activities.<p>The night passed uneventfully.<p>-<p>"This box here has twelve numbers in it." Geese said as he placed his hand over a wooden box with an opening on the cover. "One for each team."<p>It was barely six in the morning and a cold breeze could be felt on the cliff. All the teams were currently standing next to the platform, with Geese standing next to a small table on which said box was placed.<p>The fighters were all dressed in their fighting clothes, ready to battle.<p>It didn't go unnoticed by Ranma, Ryoga and Ukyo that Akane was wearing the Densetsu no Doogi. Ryoga would never go against Akane in any way, while Ranma simply didn't care. Ukyo gave Akane a frown, which Akane returned fiercely as if daring her to say anything. The chef was about to when Geese continued and their attention was brought back to the front.<p>"Let's make this quick so we can begin the tournament. The rules are very simple." The blonde man said. "Each team will send a fighter forward and they will fight it out until one of them loses. Then another fighter will take the loser's place and so on. The team that wins the match, by defeating all three fighters of the other team, advances to the next round. You lose only by being knocked out or being forced out of the platform." He didn't really like the rule about being knocked out of the platform, but Nabiki had insisted that it would add some kind of challenge to the fights. "Is everything clear?" Seeing only nods he smirked. "Then let's get started. The first team is the Shingo Team."<p>Shingo nodded and stepped forward. He put his hand inside the box and retrieved a piece of paper. "Number four." He read.<p>"You participate in the second match. Next is the Kane Team."<p>Billy stepped forth and picked a number as well. "Number six."<p>"Third match. Now we have the Dragon Team."<p>Ryoga picked the number and handed it to Geese, who frowned and read it aloud. "Number twelve. You'll fight in the sixth match." Ryoga turned to glare at Ranma and Iori before silently returning to his place with his teammates.<p>Iori smiled darkly in return. *I've already shown you your place, pig. I'll gladly do it again.*<p>Ranma just groaned as he felt the raw hostility coming his way. He really had to wonder if this tournament would solve his problems or only make them worse.<p>"Next is the Phoenix Team."<p>Kiima spared a glare at Ranma before stepping forward and retrieving a piece of paper as well. "Eleven." She said as she turned to regard Ryoga. She'd have to go over him to get to Ranma. She didn't know Ryoga was mirroring her thoughts exactly.<p>"Wandering Team, step forward." Geese said, already knowing who would. He couldn't help but smile inwardly at seeing a little girl of about ten enthusiastically run up to the box and stand on her tiptoes to reach inside. She smiled and gave him the folded piece of paper.<p>The fighters who didn't know the little girl or her parents looked at each other and wondered how such a little thing could be allowed to participate in the tournament. *She could be seriously hurt.* More than one person thought.<p>"Number seven, will participate in the fourth match." He said gravely. When the little girl returned to her parents' side he looked up to the others. "The Rage Team."<p>A tall and very muscled man stepped forward and his hand barely fit in the hole to retrieve the number. "Number ten." He said in a deep voice as he looked at the remaining team, obviously wondering which one would be his first obstacle.<p>"Will participate in the fifth match. Now we have the Kuonji Team."<p>Ukyo stepped forward and put her hand inside the box to pick a number. She retrieved a piece of paper and unfolded it. "Number one." She read aloud.<p>Geese nodded. "First match. One member of the Boss Team." He said to Rugal and Krauser, since he couldn't pick his team's number right now.<p>Rugal walked casually forward and picked the number in the same manner. He smirked cruelly at Ukyo, Akira and Jubei and showed them the little piece of paper. A big number two was easily read on it.<p>Ukyo and Akira stared defiantly back, while Jubei had a look of extreme concentration on his face as he stared at his tall opponent-to-be.<p>"Amazon Team." Geese called out. One of the women picked the number and handed it to him. "Number nine. You will face the Rage Team in the fifth match." He said pointing at the members of said team.<p>The Amazon stared at them for a moment before dismissing them and going back to her team.<p>Geese chuckled when he heard the muscled man from the Rage Team growl angrily at the casual dismissal. "Very well. Now we need one member for the Anything Goes Team." He said the name with obvious humor in his voice, which elicited an angry scowl from Genma and twin growls from Akane and Soun.<p>Akane glared defiantly at Geese and picked out a number. "Number eight!" She threw the piece of paper at him, her anger obvious to everyone.<p>The youngest Tendo expected Geese to get angry at the challenge, but instead of that he only smiled in a demean way at her. "Will face the Wandering Team in the fourth match." *And lose in a most humiliating way.* He added to himself. Without waiting for Akane to leave he read the name of the next team, eliciting another glare from the girl. "The Musk Team, step up."<p>Herb did so and picked number eleven, making it so his team would face the Shingo Team in the second match and the Yagami and Kane Teams would clash in the third match. Billy nervously looked at Ranma and Iori, wondering which one of the two would hurt him the most. It wouldn't matter in the end, since he would give it his all to win, but every encounter he'd had against those two after Ranma completed his training with Geese had ended up with him in a hospital bed.<p>The fighters looked at each other and the tension among them grew. Adrenaline rushed through their veins as chi charged the air.<p>"The order of the matches is chosen. Now all of you get ready." Geese announced in a loud voice, then finished in a whisper. "Because the fighting is about to begin."<p>END PART 22<p>Author's notes: The first King of Fighters Tournament in this world is about to begin. The fighters are ready, the platform is waiting and the matches are chosen.<p>I selected the order of the matches throwing a twelve-sided die. I ran the risk of having a final match that would be too easy for one of the teams, but it turned out it's not going to be that way.
