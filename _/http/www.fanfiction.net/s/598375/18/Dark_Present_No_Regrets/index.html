</div>They burst in the clinic in a hurry, quickly scanning the waiting room and seeing both Kuno and Yuka were still there.<p>As soon as the kendoist and the girl saw the new arrivals they stood up from the couch and regarded them. "Todo." Kuno greeted somberly. Yuka remained silent but nodded in greeting to the newly arrived couple.<p>She was nervous at seeing Ranma and the changes he had gone through. Even if some of her friends had told her all about it, she had refrained from associating with the pigtailed martial artist in order to stand by Akane on this. She knew he was older and married, but aside from that she knew little else. She studied the woman with Ranma and wondered how such a little woman could possibly beat Akane with such brutality. That particular thought brought her back to the present situation and she winced. Akane had been more than brutal with Daisuke.<p>Ranma nodded to the kendoist. "How is he?"<p>As soon as they arrived Kuno called the Todo Dojo to inform of what happened. He was aware that Ranma was the boy's sensei and figured he had a right to know. "The good doctor is still inside with him."<p>"Have you called his parents?" Kasumi asked.<p>The kendoist nodded. "His mother should be here shortly. I called her just before I did you." He smiled a little. "You probably only beat her to this place because of your training."<p>Seeing Kuno crack a joke the Todos relaxed slightly. Kuno was an experienced fighter, even if he had been delusional most of his life, and knew how to judge an injury when he saw it. If he wasn't too concerned they could assume it wasn't something permanent.<p>"I'm sorry." A female voice whispered just loud enough for them to hear. They turned to Yuka, who was looking at the floor. "Akane beat him up because of me."<p>Ranma looked at the girl strangely. How could she be behind Akane's temper tantrum? Kasumi looked similarly confused. It was Kuno who broke the uncomfortable silence after her statement. "I believe you are unfair to yourself." When the girl turned up to look at him he continued. "Tendo Akane had no right to involve herself in the matter. It was her the one who intruded in your affairs and also the one who started the fight."<p>Yuka still didn't seem convinced but she let the matter drop. After that she, with some help from Kuno, told Ranma and Kasumi how things happened. She paled when Kuno described the last attack, not having realized it was meant to cripple Daisuke. She paled further when she caught sight of Ranma's face. She had come to know the boy, at least superficially, and for him to have an expressionless face was a new. That and the fact that his eyes hardened considerably.<p>Ranma turned his gaze to Kasumi, who met it and nodded to him. They both knew what had to be done.<p>Just as Yuka was about to say something the door to the room opened, allowing in a distressed middle aged woman. When she noticed the other people in the room she rushed to them. "Where's my son?" She asked in a voice shaking with fear.<p>It took five minutes to calm the woman down. Kuno assured her that the doctor was currently taking care of her son, which helped calm her enough to be told what happened.<p>Ranma clenched his fists tightly during the retelling. Even if he had heard the exact same words not ten minutes ago he still felt enraged about what happened to his friend and student. Kasumi placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, which he took in his own and squeezed gently.<p>When Yuka finished speaking she bowed low to Daisuke's mother. "Please, forgive me for what happened to your son."<p>The woman, now calmer since she knew her boy wasn't in danger, sighed. *So all this happened because my little boy is interested in a girl.* She looked down at Yuka and smiled faintly. *At least he has good taste.* With that she placed a hand on Yuka's shoulder. "You shouldn't apologize for something that isn't your fault, dear."<p>"But..." The girl protested as she straightened.<p>Kasumi interrupted her before she could continue. "Just let it go. No one here blames you for what happened." She finished with a smile.<p>Daisuke's mother turned to Ranma. "My son told me you are his sensei in the martial arts."<p>Ranma nodded seriously. "I am. And you can be certain that I won't allow this to go unpunished."<p>Just then Tofu entered the room. Everyone bombarded him with questions about Daisuke's health and he inwardly chuckled. It happened so often that, even if he didn't understand what everybody was asking at the same time, he knew what the questions were. He regarded the only woman he didn't know in the room, supposing it was Daisuke's mother. "The boy should recover nicely in a couple of weeks. He's got a minor concussion and quite a bruise on the left side of his back, but no permanent damage was done."<p>Several sighs of relief could be heard. The women made their way into the room, leaving Ranma, Tofu and Kuno behind. The doctor turned to Ranma with a grim expression on his face. "I take it you already know who did this?"<p>Ranma nodded somberly. "You knew it was bound to happen sooner or later."<p>"It saddens me to know that by my actions I harmed Tendo Akane this much." Kuno said with a heavy sigh.<p>Ranma patted the kendoist on the back. "We all have to share the blame for this one."<p>With nothing else to say they made their way to Daisuke's room.<p>-<p>"I still don't understand." Akane said with her head resting on her hands. She had spent all the time in her classes wondering why Yuka wouldn't see reason. It was perfectly clear Daisuke only got what he deserved, so why was everybody acting as if she was the one in the wrong?<p>Now that she was sitting under a tree having lunch, Sayuri by her side, she continued to wonder about the morning's events. Even Hinako-sensei reprimanded her on her behavior, she took Daisuke's side even if the pervert got what he deserved.<p>As Akane continued to brood over the way the world was being unfair to her, specially after she won and proved herself right as always, Sayuri stared at her friend with sad eyes. She knew Akane had jumped the gun a little this time, but didn't have the heart to confront her with it. She was her friend, and friends supported each other.<p>They both turned when Nabiki's voice was heard. "You really screwed up, sis." The middle Tendo sister said with a somber expression on her face.<p>Akane narrowed her eyes at the tone of voice her sister used. "What do you want, Nabiki?"<p>Nabiki just turned to see all the other students, who were giving Akane nervous glances. Some of them, Nabiki recognized them as Ranma's other students, were even glaring at her younger sister. "I just wanted you to realize what a big grave you dug for yourself."<p>"What is that supposed to mean, Nabiki? Shouldn't you be helping your sister instead of enjoying it?" Sayuri asked in defiance, and inwardly smiled when Akane backed her up.<p>Nabiki snorted. "I'm not helping someone who doesn't want to help herself. It's not profitable." She then turned to Sayuri and the younger girl shifted nervously when remembering just who she was dealing with. "Besides, Sayuri-chan, I'm not enjoying the way my little sister condemned the Dojo."<p>At the mention of her Dojo Akane perked up instantly, her planned retort dying in her lips. "What about the Dojo?"<p>Nabiki shook her head theatrically and reached into her pocket. "Kuno-chan brought this with him from Tofu's." She said as she took out a neatly folded piece of paper and gave it to her sister. "He also told me one just like this was addressed to daddy and should already be in his hands."<p>Akane took the letter from her sister's hand and unfolded it with trembling hands. For Nabiki to give this to her without charging meant it was serious. Her eyes widened when she understood the contents.<p>Sayuri watched nervously as Akane first seemed to become afraid. Then, as usual, that fear was replaced by anger. So much that her battle aura became visible around her.<p>"What's the meaning of this?" The youngest Tendo demanded as she crumbled the letter in her hands. Her tone of voice demanded an answer as she glared up and into her sister's eyes.<p>Nabiki bit down the urge to yell at her sister. *She still can't see it?* She thought incredulously to herself. Putting as much ice in her voice as possible she answered. "It means, dear sister, that Ranma challenged the Dojo for its sign."<p>Sayuri paled at the implications. "He can't."<p>Nabiki turned to her and Sayuri cringed from the look directed her way. "And why not? Akane did challenge Kasumi for the Todo Dojo's sign."<p>"But that was different." Sayuri protested weakly. She shut up when Nabiki just raised an eyebrow, challenging her to elaborate.<p>They both turned to Akane when the paper in her hands was ripped apart. "THAT PERVERTED JERK!" She bellowed, attracting the attention from everybody in the schoolyard. She jumped to her feet and turned a murderous glare at her sister. "And you're doing nothing about it!" She accused.<p>Nabiki glared right back. Many who were watching felt faint at seeing the Ice Queen actually look angry. "Grow up, princess! You brought this upon yourself."<p>Akane grew even angrier at her sister's words. "What did you say?"<p>"You heard me. In attacking Daisuke not only did you ask for trouble with the Todos, you also proved you lack any self-control at all. You..." She was interrupted by pain flaring in her midsection.<p>"Akane-chan!" Sayuri cried in surprise at seeing her friend punch Nabiki to shut her up. *Not that she didn't deserve it.* She thought with a little sense of pleasure at seeing Nabiki, the Ice Queen of Furinkan High, finally getting what she deserved.<p>Nabiki, having abandoned training in martial arts more than a decade ago, doubled over and fell to her knees. She clutched her stomach as she felt Akane take a hold of her shirt and lift her to her feet.<p>Akane glared at the girl she held by the collar of her shirt. "Now what were you saying?" She asked in a mocking tone.<p>Nabiki fought down the tears that threatened to flow out of her eyes, both from physical and emotional pain, and glared at her sister. In between coughs she managed to blurt out a remark that made Akane blow her top. "You just proved me right."<p>Akane stared incredulously at her sister. What was she talking about? The one in agonizing pain was Nabiki, so Akane was obviously right. She won the fight, right? Anger returned and she punched her sister in the jaw, sending her sprawling to the ground.<p>Nabiki's world was spinning as she fought to remain awake. She knew she made a stupid mistake. There was no way she could defend herself from an irate Akane. Words were always strong enough before, but they would be no good now. Her sister was beyond words, beyond threats. All she could do was cling to consciousness. Even if it was tempting to just let go she wouldn't give the little princess the satisfaction.<p>"Leave her alone!" One of Nabiki's subordinates yelled as she stood protectively in front of her boss, who was struggling to get up with little success. The fear in her face was evident, but she couldn't let Akane further hurt Nabiki.<p>Akane was unaffected by the interruption, but it served as a trigger for the others to act as well.<p>"Stay away from her, Tendo." One member of the kendo club said as he stepped forward, followed by his friends.<p>"Back off, Akane." One of the girls ordered as she joined the group protecting Nabiki. She was followed by all of Ranma's students.<p>In a matter of seconds Akane was facing a crowd. Many amongst it had reasons to be angry with the middle Tendo sister, but none of them could let something like this happen.<p>Akane fell back into a stance. She had once taken on a crowd of boys and won, she could do it again. She would prove she was right and it didn't matter who she had to hurt to do so.<p>"HALT!" Kuno roared as he stepped between Akane and the crowd. His eyes were hard as steel as he stared at Akane. "Is your pride so important that you would strike against your own flesh?" He asked in an accusing tone of voice. But he not only accused Akane, he also accused himself for his part in the youngest Tendo's behavior.<p>Akane glared at Kuno, all her rage finding a focus to vent on. "You have no right to talk, Kuno."<p>The boy nodded. "Quite true." He admitted without hesitation but didn't move out of the way. "I would suggest though, that instead of wasting energy now you prepare for tonight's events."<p>Akane looked confused for a moment, but then realization struck. "What?"<p>"I understand Ranma will be visiting your Dojo tonight. Especially after he finds out about this little incident." The kendoist said as he motioned for Nabiki, who had managed to assume a sitting position with the help of one of the girls.<p>Akane looked all around her at the crowd of students. Most of them were regarding her with fear and some even with disgust. Since she couldn't come up with a comeback for Kuno's words she decided to take his advice. She seemed to become even angrier than before, if that's possible, turned on her heels and ran out the school grounds towards the Dojo.<p>She also didn't want the other students to see her cry. *Can't they see this is all Ranma's fault?* She asked herself as her vision blurred slightly.<p>"Akane-chan, wait!" Sayuri cried out as she rushed after her friend.<p>The rest of the students looked at each other and wondered how things could come to this.<p>Kuno ignored this as he made his way to Nabiki. He easily lifted her in his arms and started walking towards the nurse's office. Nabiki's subordinates quickly followed after them. The rest of the student body just dispersed, many of them making plans to be at the Tendo Dojo tonight.<p>Nabiki smirked at Kuno as the boy carried her. "You stood up for me." She said calmly, to which Kuno only nodded. "Without your bokken." Another nod. "My sister could've beaten you into a hamburger, you know?" When Kuno once again nodded seriously she smiled genuinely. "Thanks, Kuno-chan." She whispered for only him to hear.<p>Even if Nabiki tried to make light of the situation, she was hurting badly from it. She successfully managed to put up a convincing front, but behind it she felt like crying. Today she had confronted her little sister, and it was the first real fight they had. She knew things would never be the same between them, and that hurt. Tendo Nabiki cared for her family, and it enraged her to see what Akane had turned into. So much that she lost control of herself and, even though she knew her little sister would react badly, said some very mean things. They were true, but for Akane to have them rubbed on her face it was too much.<p>Kuno resisted the urge to make a sarcastic comment about him dragging Nabiki to the nurse's office. Even if she was very good at hiding it, she must be hurt from the confrontation. *And it's only the beginning.* He thought sourly. There was no doubt in his mind that after tonight the rest of her family would resent her for helping Ranma. He could only wonder why the girl in his arms was helping the pigtailed martial artist. She was smart enough to know the consequences.<p>With that they entered the school building, leaving behind a field where a battle more than physical took place.<p>-<p>Cologne raised an eyebrow when she, checking the mail, recognized a symbol she'd been seeing a lot lately. *An interesting offer.* She thought as she placed the letter down. It seemed like she would have another request for the council of elders once the messenger arrived.<p>-<p>"Where's Nabiki?" Soun asked his youngest daughter after she finished telling him what happened at school. To say that he was angered would be an understatement.<p>Of course it probably had something to do with Akane telling her side of the story, not mentioning that the boy molesting her friend was only walking with her, and that Nabiki stopped her from crippling him instead of siding with him. Sound would be angry either way that his daughter came home in tears, but not knowing all the facts made him angrier.<p>Through it all Sayuri silently sat next to Akane, giving her friend support. She didn't try to correct Akane's story, since she believed it mostly to be true. To her Daisuke was molesting Yuka, taking her away from her friends, while Akane attacked the boy as she always attacked Ranma. Maybe she got carried away, but protecting her friends was always important to Akane. The pigtailed pervert always got up for more after Akane's attacks, right? Why should it be any different with another pervert?<p>Let it be known that Sayuri had little to no knowledge about martial arts. Had she recognized Akane's last attack for what it was she would probably be trying to help her friend calm down and see reason.<p>Akane answered her father's question with a frown. "She's probably with that pervert and his hussy."<p>Soun's features darkened. That Ranma challenged his wishes and went so far as to seek to destroy the Dojo was bad enough. That he also dragged Nabiki into his schemes was unforgivable. He turned to Genma. "Your son has to pay for this, Saotome."<p>Genma nodded. "We'll get our chance tonight, Tendo. Tonight we'll unite the schools." He said seriously. The determination in his eyes told Soun his old friend had a plan in mind.<p>"You can't be serious!" Sayuri exclaimed, earning the attention of everyone in the room. "Even after all he's done you still try to make Akane marry that perverted freak?"<p>"Sayuri-chan." Akane whispered, grateful for her friend's support. It was that, in fact, that kept her going today instead of turning into a sobbing mess.<p>Genma turned to his youngest daughter's friend. "Don't worry, girl. After I'm done with the boy he'll be an obedient husband to Akane." His eyes flashed with anger. "He's dishonored the Saotome name enough with his foolish actions."<p>After that Genma started explaining his plan to the others.<p>In the kitchen Kasumi rolled her eyes at the stupidity of it. Not that it surprised her, though. Genma and her father always came up with the stupidest of plans.<p>Even if it didn't work it would still hurt Ranma and his family, though. The eldest Tendo sister decided she'd go along with it. Ranma was destroying her family. She'd just be returning the favor.<p>-<p>Saotome Nodoka walked home after shopping for groceries. Her steps were those of a defeated woman, one that had nothing else to live for. All she could think about was how she lost her only son. *But not my honor.* Honor. It was the only thing that kept her going for those ten years, and it seemed like it would have to be what kept her alive now. Love was obviously not for her to enjoy. Cologne and Kasumi often went to her house to try and cheer her up, and she thanked them dearly for it, but their efforts were useless in the long run. Her son was lost to her.<p>So immersed was she in her own depression that when she turned the corner she didn't notice the man until she crashed into him. Thankfully he was fast enough to stop her from falling or dropping her bags. "I'm sorry. Are you alright?" He asked in a deep voice.<p>Nodoka looked up and was startled to see a tall man with red hair looking down at her as if he knew her. "It was my fault." She said.<p>He only nodded and let go before walking past her. A tall blue-haired woman that stared at her expressionlessly followed him.<p>Nodoka turned and gasped when she saw the rest of the group walking with the man she just bumped into. *Ranma.* The small redhead was easily recognizable even if she had her back turned. The pigtailed martial artist was walking down the street with Kasumi by her side. The others Nodoka didn't recognize, but they were obviously with her son as well. *Not my son. Not anymore.* She reminded herself and her shoulders slumped. She stared wistfully at her child's back before making her way home, her steps even heavier than before.<p>-<p>Everyone in the Tendo Dojo sat silently around the table in the dining room. It was already dark outside, and so they waited for Ranma to arrive as patiently as they could. Nabiki didn't return home after school, but that was to be expected after what happened. Happosai hadn't been around for the entire day, something his disciples were grateful about for the old pervert could ruin everything. Besides the fact that they would give anything to get rid of him.<p>Not a word was exchanged, as they had already planned out everything, and they enjoyed the quiet before the storm. Preparations were complete and the sign was already inside the dojo.<p>The silence was broken by the ominous sound of someone banging hard on the Dojo's back door. "I'm here to challenge the dojo!" Came the female cry, which everyone recognized came from Ranma's cursed form.<p>Soun and Genma locked gazes and nodded before getting to their feet. Kasumi quietly followed suit, her facial expression as calm as ever. Akane stood up uncertainly, Ranma's voice carried nothing but ice, but a hand on her shoulder reassured her and she silently thanked Sayuri for being there. The girl called home earlier that day and remained by Akane's side all the time.<p>They all walked to the Dojo and Soun proceeded to open the back door. It wasn't a surprise for them to see the small redhead waiting outside. Even if Ranma's cursed form looked old enough to pass for Nodoka's sister everyone in Nerima was used to weird things happening.<p>What the Tendos and their guests didn't expect was for Ranma to bring so many people with him. Next to Ranma stood Kasumi, Geese, Iori and Leona. Two steps behind many of Ranma's students were present, their faces showing their expectation for the upcoming challenge. Soun frowned as he looked down at Ranma. "Who's challenging this Dojo?"<p>Ranko didn't feel the least bit intimidated by Soun's grave behavior. She locked gazes with him as she spoke calmly. "I, Ranko Howard, have come to challenge this Dojo. Should I win I'll take your sign."<p>Everyone but Ranko's companions from the other world was surprised to hear Ranma refer to himself by that name.<p>After recovering from the surprise Soun motioned for Ranma to enter. He glared pointedly at Kasumi as she followed her husband in. The black-haired woman ignored him.<p>Geese, Iori and Leona entered the building silently. The students would watch from outside, since the Dojo wasn't big enough to hold them all in.<p>As the combatants prepared themselves for the match, Geese Howard locked gazes with Saotome Genma. He smirked when the other man couldn't keep his gaze. *So that's Ranma's birth father.* He thought. *He's a good fighter, but nowhere close enough to our level.*<p>Genma looked away from the blonde man. His eyes reminded him of Ranma's own in the Todo Dojo. He also wanted to make sure that everything was ready one last time. So many people in the room could complicate his plan.<p>Kasumi Tendo stood by one wall of the Dojo with Akane and Sayuri. On the opposite wall Geese, Iori, Leona and Kasumi Todo waited for the match to take place.<p>As both fighters faced each other Genma approached to signal the start of the fight. Soun and Ranko felt comfortable enough with the silence that seemed to permeate the Dojo, so neither planned on breaking it by speaking.<p>From his position Geese frowned. The Tendos seemed to be expectant of something. It surely couldn't be of winning the match. Soun defeating Ranko simply wasn't an option. *Something's wrong.* He though as he scanned his surroundings with his eyes.<p>Besides some training equipment nothing seemed amiss. The Dojo sign sat on one corner of the room, since the Tendos obviously took it off its place for the challenge.<p>So why did Geese get the feeling that something bad was about to happen?<p>Back in the center of the room Genma regarded the combatants. "This fight is for the sign of the Tendo Dojo. It won't end until someone can't continue fighting."<p>Soun nodded seriously. Genma then turned to his son and glared at her. She didn't look at him as she nodded too. "Hajime!" Genma cried as he jumped back, giving the fighters room for the match to take place.<p>The Tendo patriarch fell into a defensive stance instantly. His movements seemed a little awkward for any competent fighter watching. He was obviously out of practice.<p>Ranko just stood calmly, her body relaxed as she stared at the many holes in the defense of her opponent. She didn't understand why Soun decided to take the challenge himself. Even if he was more skilled Akane had a better chance of actually landing a blow.<p>As they continued to stare at each other Soun decided to apply one of the prime tenets of the Anything Goes Martial Arts. "Why didn't you bring your bastard with you? Afraid she'll watch you lose?" He insulted his opponent in an attempt to make her lose her temper.<p>Ranko smirked darkly at the taunt, having recognized it for what it was and not letting it affect her. "It was her time to go to bed. I wouldn't let her lose any sleep over someone as pathetic as you." Two could play the same game.<p>"Why are you doing this? Why do you insist on bringing further dishonor to yourself?" Soun asked as he took a step to the side, slowly starting to circle his opponent.<p>Ranko remained unmoving, only her eyes followed Soun's movements. "I already told you I don't care about honor if it means hurting my family. As to why I'm doing this I think it should be quite obvious. Your daughter attacked one of the Todo Dojo's students with the intent to cripple. Luckily Daisuke will recover, but I can't let someone like you to continue teaching fighting techniques without the proper control required to form a martial artist." She said as her eyes narrowed.<p>Akane sputtered at the redhead's words. All that stopped her from intervening in the fight was her sister's hand on her shoulder. That and the fact that she knew she'd have her chance to get even with the pigtailed martial artist. If Genma's plan succeeded the pervert would be at her mercy. He would surely apologize for all his insults. Now she had to decide if she wanted to forgive him.<p>In the meantime Soun was shaking with rage. Plan or no plan he would teach this upstart a lesson.<p>Ranko got tired of having Soun glare at her. She simply concentrated and lifted her hand in front of her. She wouldn't give him the satisfaction of a fight.<p>Soun's eyes widened when he saw Ranma's hand crackle with dark energy. He rushed the redhead, trying to disrupt whatever she was preparing. He was too slow.<p>"Reppuu Ken." Ranko whispered as she unleashed the violent wave technique on Soun. The man flew back to crash against the Dojo wall and land on an undignified hip on the floor. He was still conscious, but it was obvious he wouldn't be getting up in a while. "I win." She announced, effectively breaking the silence that followed her attack since almost everyone was too shocked to react.<p>Akane stared at Ranma in shock. How could he do this to her father. How could he attack Soun with a chi blast. "You cheated!" She protested when Ranma declared his victory.<p>Ranko turned to Akane calmly. "How did I cheat?"<p>"You used a chi blast. This was supposed to be a fight." The youngest Tendo protested.<p>Ranko raised an eyebrow. "Chi blasts are a part of martial arts." The redhead said coldly. After that she ignored Akane as she walked to take the sign.<p>Akane was about to protest when she heard her sister whisper something in her ear. "Remember the plan, Akane-chan." This shocked the youngest Tendo, since she didn't think Kasumi knew about the plan. And if she did she expected for her sister to go against it.<p>Geese frowned when he saw the expectant look on Genma's face. Now he knew something was definitely up.<p>Kasumi Todo sighed when she saw her husband about to take the sign. She knew they needed to do it, but it still felt wrong to take a family's tradition away.<p>"AAAHHHHHHHH!" Ranko's scream of terror, followed by the sound of the sign falling from her shaking hands, made everyone turn to her.<p>"TAKE IT AWAY FROM HER!" Geese bellowed as he rushed towards his heir. The others were frozen in shock, not having expected something like this to happen.<p>When Ranko took the sign she saw a box behind it. Out of it came a scared white cat that crashed against her in an attempt to escape. The redhead fell back and backpedaled, trying to get away from the creature. But her cries only served to further scare the animal, which froze in place and reflexively took out its claws.<p>Geese was about to reach Ranko when he felt something impact with his side. He was sent sprawling to the ground, since his focus was entirely on taking the cat away from the terrified redhead, only to turn and see Genma recovering from a kick. *That idiot.* He thought as he got up.<p>It took a few seconds for Iori, Leona and Kasumi to react. They quickly rushed Ranko as well, and this time it was obvious Genma wouldn't be able to land a surprise attack.<p>The only problem was that feeling the claws pierce her skin took Ranko over the edge of her sanity.<p>Kasumi cursed when she saw Ranko go still under the cat, which took the chance to run away and out the door. She should've reacted sooner.<p>Geese glared daggers at Genma, who was currently grinning. *If we survive this I'm killing him.*<p>Genma and Soun mentally cheered at seeing their plan work. Now all they had to do was wait.<p>Akane watched as Ranma turned over and stood on all fours. Genma had been quite explicit about what she had to do. She had to beat Kasumi Todo to the pigtailed martial artist. The eldest Saotome thought Ranma would show its affection for Akane, as usual, and in doing so his so called wife would see where Ranma's real love was. After the traumatic events of the past couple of weeks Akane didn't know any better than to trust Genma.<p>Iori, Leona and Kasumi stopped running when they saw Ranko turn inhuman eyes towards them. The red-haired man summed it up pretty well with just two words. "Oh shit!"<p>Kasumi turned to the students that were watching everything from outside, her expression clearly one of fear. "Get out of here!" She yelled. "Get away as fast as you can!" They didn't know what was going on, but to actually see Kasumi scared was enough for them to obey. They would find out what happened tomorrow. They all turned on their heels and ran for it.<p>Akane didn't waste any time and, ignoring everyone else, made her way to Ranma.<p>Genma smirked when he saw Ranma turn to Akane, who was calling to him. His smirk vanished when Ranma snarled at the girl and his fingers dug deep scratches on the floorboards.<p>"Get away from her!" Kasumi cried as she started running towards Akane.<p>Iori and Leona took advantage of Ranko's distraction with the Tendo girl to try and sneak up on her. Maybe with a surprise attack they could take her down. Leona attacked from the side while Iori approached form behind.<p>"Ranma..." Akane called uncertainly.<p>Ranko suddenly jumped over a sweep. She didn't even need to see it to know it was coming. Before she could land she felt someone impact with her from behind. Strong hands took a hold of her wrists and held them above her head as the attacker lifted her off the ground. She roared in rage as she resisted with all her might.<p>Iori growled when he felt his arms strain beyond their limits to hold the dangerous claws at bay. Even in his advantageous positions he knew the possessed fighter's strength was beyond his prowess. "Leona!" He called out as the woman in his arms started trashing violently, deep gashes forming on the wooden floor from her hint legs.<p>The blue-haired woman wasted no time in rushing in. She landed a powerful knee blow to the redhead's midsection.<p>Iori felt the blow and grunted to keep standing, careful not to lose his grip on Ranko's wrists.<p>As Leona continued to beat on the redhead Akane took a step forward. "Stop!" Kasumi ordered as she obstructed the youngest Tendo's way.<p>"They're beating him up!" Akane cried as she tried to circle around the shorter woman, but to no avail.<p>Kasumi shook her head vehemently. It was obvious from the expression on her face that she didn't enjoy the spectacle either. "It's the only way. If they don't submit her she'll kill all of you." Kasumi said seriously.<p>"What's she talking about?" Genma demanded as he turned to Geese, who was waiting expectantly to jump in should Ranko manage to free herself. It didn't appear that she would, for her struggles were already weakening from all the blows Leona was landing on her, but with the Nekoken you never knew. "What have you done to my son?"<p>Geese snarled without taking his attention from the beating. "You idiot! The Nekoken uses chi to power up the cat state and the girl has access to enormous quantities of dark chi. Your stupid scheme turned her into a murderous monster."<p>Genma could only turn in horror to see Ranma receive a blow to her face. She struggled with a ferocity he hadn't seen before, but with her current leverage her struggles were futile.<p>It was then that Leona took a step back to prepare a powerful kick. She hoped it would be enough to knock Ranko out. If it wasn't she didn't know what would. As it turned out she didn't get an answer. Ranko managed to block the kick with one of her legs, while using the other to take a hold of the offending leg with her chi claws.<p>Leona had to stifle a scream of pain when the chi claws cut deeply into her flesh, which was made worse when she felt a tug that threatened to rip her leg apart.<p>Ranko pulled Leona towards her and used both her legs to push the woman off herself, in the process also cutting deep into the woman's flesh before making Iori lose his balance and fall back.<p>When Iori saw Leona flying away as he fell back he called forth his blood to burn the irate woman in his arms with the Orochi Magatama. He prepared himself for the blow, particularly to keep a hold of Ranko's wrists for Geese to finish the redhead off. When he felt his back touching the ground his world exploded in pain.<p>Ranko growled in pain when she felt the searing pain of the accursed Magatama, yet she didn't let it defeat her as she slammed her head back when she felt Iori touching the ground. As a result she smashed his head through the floorboards and against the solid ground bellow, breaking his nose and stunning him enough to release his grip on her arms.<p>She back flipped and took a hold of his wrists. With a mighty pull she sent him flying away from her.<p>Leona crashed with the Dojo wall, having the air knocked out of her, and cracked it. She fell to her knees and clutched at the wounds on her leg and chest in pain. When she heard the distinct sound of Iori's flames in use and the sickening sound of breaking bone she looked up. The last thing she saw was Iori flying towards her at high speed.<p>Geese winced when Iori crashed into Leona, and then both crashed through the wall and didn't stop until they hit the stone outer wall. It collapsed on top of them. *They're out.* He thought grimly as he prepared himself to face against the growling Ranko. When he turned to the side Genma was nowhere to be seen. Soun was being tended by one of his daughters, who watched Ranma in a weird combination of fear, disgust and... desire?<p>"Ranma, stop it!" Akane commanded as she pushed Kasumi away. The other woman had been too distracted by the sudden defeat of her friends to put up a good defense. She found herself losing her footing.<p>*Oh no!* Both Geese and Kasumi thought at the same time.<p>Ranko leaped at Akane with clear intentions of killing her. No one hurt the animal's mate.<p>Akane saw the chi claws appear and froze in place. She couldn't believe it, but the evidence was here. Even if she denied it even to herself, she still held a small hope that Ranma loved her. That everything would turn back to the way it was before. So shocked was she by the revelation that she didn't try to put up any kind of defense, not that it would do any good.<p>"AKANE!" Kasumi Tendo cried as she saw the claws come dangerously close. An image of Akane cut to pieces appeared in her horrified mind.<p>A scream of pain was heard in the Dojo, but it wasn't Akane's voice. Time seemed to stop then.<p>Kasumi and Soun stared at the result of their plan with disbelief.<p>Geese's blood boiled. He promised Saotome Genma would pay for this.<p>Akane stared in shock at the blood. For a martial artist she hadn't seen a lot of it in her life.<p>Kasumi fought back the tears of pain and smiled at her husband, who was currently licking the four gashes on her side. When Kasumi pushed Akane out of the way, and in the process endangered herself, Ranko managed to stop her attack enough not to cut her mate into pieces. Four deep cuts were the result, though.<p>Not many things could actually calm Ranko down when in the Nekoken, but having hurt her mate snapped her out of her rage. As she licked the wounds she didn't part her eyes from Kasumi's own. There was an apology there.<p>The others could see a bond between the wounded woman and the human cat. A bond that even insanity couldn't brake.<p>It was then that Akane's heart shattered completely. She realized she didn't stand a chance.<p>END PART 18<p>Author's notes: I always wondered why Ranma's neko-self was always playful. This is my guess on it. It has to do with the chi of the person. Since Ranma's was full of confidence and positive emotions before, now it's dark. The result being an angered animal. Hope you enjoyed the chapter.
