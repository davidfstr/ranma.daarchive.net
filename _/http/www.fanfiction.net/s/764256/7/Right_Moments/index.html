</div><p>"337 Split Ends"</p><p>Not ready for magic, Ranma grew closer to  that stage. He couldn't become physically better, and thought he had  nearly perfected ki-control. Aside from new, unknown techniques, his  advancement in The Art had dead-ended.</p><p>He brought this dilemma to the best thinker he understood the motivations of.</p><p>"The  short numerical name for that variation on the sex act is sixty-eight  dot two Nabiki." The middle Tendo nodded graciously, apparently Ranma  shared her hidden perverted depths. Maybe he'd been reading her manga?</p><p>"Now  here's a tough one. Put yourself in my place; refusing this constitutes  a default on our game. Years after you've arrived in Nerima, you've  mastered the repertoire of the Old Freak, can go to a standstill with  the Old Ghoul, and are stuck at a plateau in your abilities. You want  to become better in the Martial Arts without messing with magic. . . .  . how? You may ask questions for clarification."</p><p>Silently  thinking for a time, Nabiki mused, "Hmm. Interesting Saotome. Knowing  how spineless you are with women, I assume you haven't married,  possibly have more fiancées, and are still a virgin?"</p><p>Looking ashamed, Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Have  'I' also mastered the lesser techniques of the local gang of home  wreckers, like Ryouga's way of turning cloth sharp, the Breaking Point,  the Shark Fist, Mousse's hidden weapons, and Shampoo's memory altering  techniques?"</p><p>Slowly nodding, Ranma realized much remained to learn.</p><p>Taking  the nod for assent, Nabiki continued, "Ok then, obviously 'I' need to  branch out into weapons and technology. If a random gaijin with a gun  could kill me, 'I'm' not much of an artist of war. Which isn't to say  'I' should neglect training with older, more traditional weapons.  Anything Goes, right?"</p><p>Smiling, Ranma beheld dozens of new horizons.</p><p>Like  a rogue wolf detecting weakness, Nabiki went for the kill: "My turn.  Saotome, please explain to me how Martial Arts and Marital Arts are  identical. Diagrams and demonstrations are acceptable." Seductive and  daring, Nabiki emphasized her words by sliding off the sleeve of her  shirt, exposing her naked shoulder.</p><p>With a strangled "Ok 'biki you win gotta go!" Ranma was outta there.</p><p>Laughing, the mercenary Tendo switched off her tape recorder, and wondered what Ranma would be like if he grew balls.</p><p>"Bakusai  Tenketsu!" One week to learn, and painful. Though he lacked Ryoga's  toughness from the boulder-build-up training, constructing a  protective-ki shield against the debris came naturally.</p><p>"Yuck!"  Ranma doubted his unconscious father ever washed the gray bandana  hiding his baldness. Cleansing it with a rapid application of hot and  cold ki, Kasumi's startled squeal shocked him.</p><p>Appearing beside  him with bright starry eyes, the eldest Tendo invaded his personal  space, placing her hands on his shoulders and gazing piercingly into  his face. "Ranma-san," she said in a serious tone, "if you want me to  continue cooking meals, you're teaching me that!"</p><p>Not used the calm home-maker's closeness, Ranma stuttered "Er, Um, Ok Kasumi, ask me tomorrow morning and we'll start."</p><p>Releasing  him with a sincere "Thank you very much!" Kasumi bowed deeply and  returned to her kitchen, imagining chores ending instantly with puffs  of energy.</p><p>Mastering the Iron-Cloth technique took two hours, compared to his greater ki-blasts, 'twas child's play.</p><p>"HA!"</p><p>A huge shark-like wave of water and koi knocked her father out in mid-leap.</p><p>'Easy; just like the Buzzing Fist with air, or the Stationary Grapple with stone.'</p><p>Feeling a lightness on her head, Ranma noticed the koi she usually woke under had fainted and slipped off.</p><p>"Hmmm. . . . ." Mischievously, she snuck in the house, stopped Kasumi from her usual duty, and knocked on Nabiki's door.</p><p>"Mxlkjdsf!" Stated a tired mumble from the other side. Bedding rustled.</p><p>Knocking  again, an annoyed voice accompanied by dressing sounds replied, "This  better be good - who is it and what do you want?" Kasumi left after  the first knock.</p><p>In the same sugary voice she used to con food vendors out of sweets, Ranma-chan giggled "Dojo Shark, Tee Hee!"</p><p>Perpetually undone by her own curiosity, Nabiki opened her bedroom door.</p><p>"HA!"</p><p>Smiling at how the Shark Fist adapted to any surface, Ranma enjoyed the sight of her friend laid out and surprised.</p><p>Rising  from a tangle of boards and tatami, Nabiki looked out her new window  where a wall used to be. Cheerily, sunlight shone upon her messed up  morning hair. This was his wedding revenge?</p><p>Faint snoring sounded nearby. How did Akane sleep with her window open like that?</p><p>"You realize you're paying for this Saotome?" The accusation was heatedly whispered.</p><p>Nodding happily Ranma beamed "Nabiki's room. . . . 100,000 yen. . . . . the look on her face. . . . priceless!"</p><p>"Alright then." Nabiki said in a quiet voice. "Let's hurry before Kasumi wakes Akane!"</p><p>Ranma  wasn't worried; the tomboy only woke up from Kasumi's cheerful voice,  or his name shouted with lust or extreme anger. By now, he had a huge  branching mental flow-chart, mapping events precisely.</p><p>Carefully  opening the door, which still had a little yellow duck with her  sister's nameplate, Nabiki glanced inside her sibling's room, checking  her sister wasn't naked or something.</p><p>Instead, Akane sprawled  inelegantly across her bedding, like she had won a fight with her  blanket. Glancing in, Ranma thought she looked adorable.</p><p>"Oh  little sister?" Nabiki's spot-on Kasumi imitation roused Akane from the  depths of slumber, and she rubbed her eyes. Making eye contact with her  partner in crime, Nabiki nodded.</p><p>"HA!"</p><p>Akane greeted the morning with a merry fanfare:</p><p>"IEeeeeeeEEEE! Ranma. . . . and NA-Biki!"</p><p>Crumbled  flooring halted the youngest Tendo's berserk lunge as she tripped into  a botched forward roll. When she recovered, the perpetrators had  escaped. 'My own sister! Just wait until I get to her room!'</p><p>Akane's frustrated scream upon learning she'd been pre-empted in revenge shook the foundations of the Tendo House.</p><p>Having led him on a mad chase into a nearby empty lot, the red-head turned and waited for the idiot's arrival.</p><p>To  help them start, she added "Aiyah, stupid duck-boy never defeat Ranma!"  Ranma-chan wore one of Shampoo's dresses (left behind after splash of  water), the reason Mousse followed blindly.</p><p>Enraged at his  nemesis, the hidden weapons master yelled for the twenty-sixth day in  row "Saotome! Prepare to die for your crimes against Xian Pu!"</p><p>A barrage of chains and other weapons shot at Ranma, and Mousse didn't notice they vanished as fast as they appeared.</p><p>Around  an hour later, an unconscious duck quack-groaned under fifty pounds of  twisted metal and wood. 'This pile of broken garbage used to be fine  Amazon weapons, but the duck was never really a man.' Such thoughts  cheered Ranma, as she walked away whistling. Longer than expected; if  the blind boy bothered using the ki required in a useful way, he'd be a  decent sparring partner.</p><p>Hidden weapons handicapped a fighter by  tying their ki in rigid patterns. Maybe that was why only male Amazons  'mastered' it. Hiding a small amount, like a change of clothes, or two  maces and a sword was worth the power sacrifice.</p><p>"A-heh, heh!" Blushed Shampoo, "Why you want that technique Ranma?"</p><p>He'd  never gotten this response from Shampoo before. Why was she blushing?  This was the Shampoo who enjoyed sneaking naked into his bath, and kept  putting his hands on her sensitive places. What was she thinking?</p><p>-Flashback-</p><p>A  nude Shampoo is bathing in a mountain stream in the wilds of China. She  hears a thud and a moan, and is startled, glancing around.</p><p>Making a dagger appear in her hands, she slinks over to the sound's source.</p><p>She  sees the hated red-haired girl, passed out with a nosebleed and her  left hand down her pants. Announcing, "Ranma, you I kill!" Shampoo  drives the dagger right at the red head's throat...</p><p>Only to have her oblivious enemy roll sideways.</p><p>Undeterred,  the naked Amazon continues attacking. Around the tenth stab, the  unconscious redhead bumps her after dodging, forcing a loss of balance.  Windmilling madly, Shampoo slides into a full split, and feels  intimately uncomfortable.</p><p>Now really upset, Shampoo removes the  sleeping girl's sticky left hand from between her legs, and tosses the  dagger away in disgust. Considering where the girl's nasty fingers were  before, she shudders in revulsion.</p><p>Pulling out a bottle labeled  862, Shampoo snarls in her native tongue, "I might not be able to kill  you now, but you won't get more satisfaction from me!"</p><p>As it is not a known attack, the sleeping girl doesn't dodge.</p><p>Hearing  the older man she's seen with the kissed-to-die girl, Shampoo quickly  retreats to the stream. She washes herself vigorously and dresses.</p><p>Seeing a panda escape with her slumbering enemy, she yells with renewed enthusiasm "Ranma, you I kill!" and chases after.</p><p>-end FB-</p><p>"Airen, there is reason Shampoo tell you only she can make you truly happy!"</p><p>With  an unusually perceptive deduction, catching Cologne's attention, Ranma  returned, "If this reason exists Shampoo, why haven't you used it  before?"</p><p>Sounding sad, Shampoo spoke: "Xi Fa Xiang Gao Shiatsu  technique is not only useful as a weapon Ranma. Shampoo use it on self  when hunt for girl-type Ranma after first meeting. Not want to remember  or feel things in way of kiss of death. After Phoenix Mountain, Shampoo  not sure if she has any magic on her from bird peoples, so she use  formula 337, Universal Nullifier. Not realize 337 erase other formulas  from Xi Fa Xiang Gao." Making an effort, the young Amazon girl said  slowly, "I remembered experiences I am not proud of, but to be with  you, my love, I will do anything."</p><p>Appearing beside them, Cologne asked gently, "Great-grand daughter, did you remember your mother's death?"</p><p>Bowing  her head, Shampoo answered in Mandarin. "Yes, great-grandmother. I also  remember the Love Me Most technique, why girl-type Ranma doesn't know  the true joys of womanhood, and the elder's council after I returned in  disgrace from Japan."</p><p>Completely aware of Ranma's comprehension  of the language, Cologne inquired, "Now that you know no punishment  will come from failing to marry Ranma, and remember what destroyed poor  Mu Tsu, what do you plan?"</p><p>Still in Mandarin, the girl sounded  unhappy with her answer, "The Love Me Most technique is a terrible  weapon, I will never use it frivolously, and will only unseal it to  save another's life. This I swear a warrior's oath upon. I do not know  what to do about Ranma. I am in love, but I wish him his own happiness,  perhaps that is what love really is?"</p><p>Returning to Japanese, the  withered elder cackled "Wisdom never warms your bed child! Did you  realize 862 carries over between curses with Jusenkyo victims?"</p><p>No she hadn't.</p><p>"Aiyah!"  Exclaimed Shampoo happily, "Ranma, Shampoo teach you antidote for Xi Fa  Xiang Gao Shiatsu technique, only if we bathe together, and you spend  the entire day afterwards with Shampoo! Will be lots of fun!"</p><p>Shuddering, Ranma slowly backed away; Shampoo's smile and aura looked remarkably like Happosai's when he fondled lingerie.</p><p>This  information – he needed to think about it. The last words he heard upon  escaping the Cat Café especially disturbed him: "Not running after him  great-grand-daughter?" "No hiba-chan, if Ranma ever want to really be  man, he come with Shampoo." Disturbing laughter followed him into the  street.</p><p>The reactions to his little problem amused,  surprised, and angered him. He swore each to secrecy before revealing  the droopy, dreary details.</p><p>"Ranma no Hentai!" Akane embedded him in the wall with a nearby barbell. Really, he should have known better.</p><p>"Your  problem isn't magical in nature." Diagnosed Devil Hunter Kodachi. "I  might circumvent it with magic; would you like me to try?" Wanting an  absolute solution, Ranma declined.</p><p>"My son, the best way to solve  this problem, is sleeping with lots of women. Now make me proud!"  Nodoka's worldview puzzled him, but he loved his mother. Eventually,  Ranma resolved to drag the story of how his parents met out of the old  panda.</p><p>"Well it certainly explains a lot." Ukyo sounded wise and  vaguely vindicated. "I really want to help Ranchan!" Gently removing  the chef's exploring hands, Ranma decided to try someone without an  agenda involving him.</p><p>Distraught, Kasumi hugged Ranma. They were  alone together in her room, which had been difficult to arrange. "Why,  I don't know what I'd do if I suddenly couldn't! Both your forms?"</p><p>Ranma nodded miserably. She was a girl; it made Kasumi feel easier about this.</p><p>"Would you like my help? I won't actually touch you, but I think I might have a solution to your problem."</p><p>"With anyone else, I'd refuse, but I trust you Kasumi. Tell me what to do."</p><p>"Okay, this might feel odd at first, but please lie on my bed, take off your clothing, and close your eyes."</p><p>Before  following the older girl's instructions, Ranma locked the door and  closed the curtains. She positioned herself with her legs apart,  feeling very exposed.</p><p>"Don't worry about hygiene, I wash this  every morning before I bathe." Kasumi's reassurance wasn't, as Ranma  heard a loud vibrating noise.</p><p>Thirty minutes later: "I'm  sorry Ranma, your physical reactions are completely normal, are you  sure you didn't feel anything special?"</p><p>"No Kasumi, just a  tingling sensation, sort of like a nerve lock wearing off, though this  one never does. Touching my chest feels better than that, but doesn't  let me, um, you know."</p><p>"Well, I tried. Please wipe with this  towel, dress, and give me some privacy for a bit. Helping you has been,  um, frustrating for me."</p><p>Doing as instructed, and noting the damp  spot on the older Tendo's dress, Ranma thanked Kasumi and left. If  marriage meant merely trust, he'd marry Kasumi in a heartbeat. She was  the understanding elder sister he'd always wished for.</p><p>His female side was out of bounds, but what about as a guy?</p><p>Soun  slipped him a large amount of yen. "I understand son." He commiserated,  "Visit Wakari street in Adaku; the building with seven plum vines  painted on the mailbox, and ask for the 'special treatment.' Don't let  Akane find out either." His disbelief must have been plain, because  Soun added, "The schools can't be joined until this is solved, and I'd  prefer my little girl have an experienced first partner."</p><p>Ranma  went, but the woman answering the door must have been sixty years old!  He stammered a lame excuse and left. Embarrassed beyond words, he  thought 'Why buy what I should get free?'</p><p>Wow, it made him somewhat sick his mother encouraged this plan.</p><p>Interrupting  Kasumi's dinner o' beef bowl, Nodoka spoke haughtily: "I have decided  after the events following the wedding which wasn't, Ranma isn't manly.  This distressing matter came fully into my attention this afternoon.  Unless my son shows me the bloody sheets by midnight, I judge him  worthy only of swift end."</p><p>Tearfully, Akane volunteered, right on cue.</p><p>His  worries about rising to the occasion fled, when his hypocritical tomboy  put on a strip act. Sure, he promised marriage later, but tonight had  no deeper meaning than an experiment.</p><p>He hit her sleep point  three minutes in. Akane took to the sex act with the same concentration  she reserved for cooking. She utterly ignored the world, and used what  she thought to be the method exemplar.</p><p>Feeling bruised, contused  (her bloody nail marks covered his back), and violated, Ranma left the  room. He limped the sheets over to his mother, and retired. The only  blood on them was his.</p><p>'Intimacy' with Akane felt like getting a  knee to the balls. (She had managed that twice.) Why had he promised  himself she would be his first?</p><p>Ranma suspected his problem to be a Xi Fa Xiang Gao formula, and speculated others suffered holes in their minds.</p><p>How to learn the technique without bedding an Amazon?</p><p>"But Airen, we both know you better than Shampoo. That is why Shampoo hunt you to ends of Earth!"</p><p>Challenging the Amazon for the technique had been a bust.</p><p>"What about if I fought your great-grandmother instead?"</p><p>Cackles  answered his question: "Sonny-boy this is too fun for me to be  involved! I decline." Perfectly balanced on her staff, the old  matriarch watched his futile struggle with amusement.</p><p>"Aiyah  Airen, Shampoo feel unloved right now! Best way to learn technique is  make Shampoo feel special." Stepping away, the bouncy girl wiggled her  behind suggestively.</p><p>"Well what about if I gave ya a handicap?" The stress of the situation brought out an older speech pattern.</p><p>"A  fine idea son-in-law! In fact I have just the thing: with your consent,  Shampoo will use Xi Fa Xiang Gao Shiatsu on you, taking away your  knowledge of martial arts, little by little. Multiple exposures will  teach -you -(an emphasis on the word, as if no else could learn it that  way) Xi Fa Xiang Gao Shiatsu. After you no longer have Musubetsu Kakuto  Ryuu, you'll fight Shampoo. If you win, she'll give you the antidote  and you'll know the technique. If she wins, my heir gets a wonderful  husband, and you will come willingly."</p><p>"Let me think." Ranma dropped lotus-style onto the floor.</p><p>Time  passed. Shampoo came over and sat upon his crossed legs, bringing their  crotches into alignment; if not for clothing, they would be joined. She  wrapped her arms around him, and squeezed.</p><p>Miraculously, they  went undisturbed: Akane attended school, Ukyo remained sequestered at  the Ucchan's, and Mousse lay unconscious under a broken pile of hidden  weapons in an abandoned lot.</p><p>Snuggling closer, molding herself on him, Shampoo appeared content.</p><p>Distracted,  Ranma rose to his feet, almost dislodging the grabby Amazon.  Detachedly, he noticed his body's reaction to Shampoo's ministrations,  and shoved her off.</p><p>"I accept, provided you swear oaths no other tricks will be involved."</p><p>Bowing solemnly, the Amazon contingent swore.</p><p>Shampoo  could perform Xi Fa Xiang Gao successfully in about five seconds. It  took over an hour before their fight began in back of the Cat Café,  officiated by Cologne.</p><p>Seeking a quick end, the Amazon struck with a blindingly fast combo, only to have Ranma dodge.</p><p>He  retaliated with three clumsy punches she easily sidestepped and turned  into a throw, only to watch in amazement as he flipped onto his feet  from mid-air.</p><p>Upon hearing Cologne's laughter, Shampoo realized  her Airen's reflexes weren't disabled, despite his mental handicap. She  had wanted to use other formulas too, but a promise was a promise.</p><p>Satisfied  with her brilliant reasoning, Shampoo almost failed to dodge when Ranma  clasped his hands together in a gun-like shape, and shot a murky brown  ki-bullet at her.</p><p>The matriarch on the sidelines smiled; Ranma  didn't consider guns to be worthy of 'martial arts,' and had developed  the trick with unusual foresight. She could tell the emotion used was  frustrated confusion.</p><p>As the best of her village's age bracket,  Shampoo felt respect and a little awe for her Airen. But no amount of  dodging or untrained skill could stop a martial artist of her caliber.</p><p>Shampoo  would never know how close she came to defeat: Ranma had halfway  finished the Chilling Lips of Death. His brain labeled the technique  under the headings of 'sex' and 'desperation defense: female  disablement.' He jumped the foot sweep and flowed around a spinning  crescent kick while airborne, but his position after the dodged  bonbouri jab left him completely open. Shampoo's precision karate chop  hit his carotid artery, ending the battle.</p><p>Dodging didn't matter if your opponent thought five moves ahead, cutting off the avenues of escape.</p><p>The plane for China left that evening, with a quiet celebration.</p><p>Awakening with her koi, Ranma remembered, and blushed. She swiftly exited the pond, switching gender.</p><p>Engaging  his father in an exhaustive sparring session, Ranma dragged the panda  back from the breakfast table twice. His skills regained, he now  understood Xi Fa Xiang Gao Shiatsu enough to selectively remove a  person's ability. He didn't know the accepted antidote(s) or formulas,  or the risks of mixing potions. An antidote for his condition was  applied during his unconsciousness.</p><p>He clearly remembered  Shampoo's successful seduction. Enjoying the experience in both forms,  Ranma now had those feelings to sort. His mind screamed betrayal:  'Traitors! I'll never marry an Amazon now!' Despite his rage, Ranma  acknowledged his bodies wanted Shampoo's glory again. He didn't know  what to do.</p><p>"Saotome, that'll be 20,000 yen." The local expert on betrayal wasn't cheap, especially when you bought discretion.</p><p>Nabiki  learned everything, and helped. Her outraged sympathy comforted him;  the mercenary girl honestly believed some areas were off limits.</p><p>"So  the formula for memories is 110, for sexual response is 862, and the  universal nullifier is 337?" Ranma looked through Shampoo's dresser  with interest; dozens of formulas were jumbled together next to  anti-pervert ofuda and her clean panties. The garments had anti-demon  charms sewn expertly on them in silver thread.</p><p>"Yes, my love.  Would you like me to demonstrate the antidote again, before we leave  for China tomorrow?" The naked Amazon spoke slowly, in perfect Japanese.</p><p>"Sure, but on who?"</p><p>"Stick-boy,  Crazy-girl, Violent-Girl, and Pig-boy all under Xi Fa Xiang Gao. Try  using on Chef too, but ki application no work right. Chef just thank  for refreshing beauty treatment, say it good for split ends."</p><p>"On  second thought, Shampoo stay with me for now." Obviously he needed to  learn the effects of everything to master the technique - it could  take weeks!</p><p>Upon seeing her husbands spaced out smile while he looked her over, the Amazon relaxed and closed her eyes.</p><p>Finding  herself as cat in the mail to Murray's Snack Shop, (c/o Taiwan Cuisine)  thirty minutes later came as a complete surprise.</p><p>After  using 337 on herself the next morning, Ranma spent five minutes  preening in the mirror. Formula three hundred thirty seven did do  wonders for split ends!</p><p>Two months later, when Ranma  had completely mastered the formulas of Shampoo's techniques, he felt  saddened. He had further improved Xi Fa Xiang Gao until he no longer  needed the formulas. Massaging someone's head allowed him to alter  memories, skills, and physical responses. It took between five seconds  and twenty minutes, depending on the desired response.</p><p>Self-deception  failed, since he now practiced with acceptance as his primary ki-focus.  While embracing zazen, Ranma begrudgingly admitted he didn't want to  stop sleeping with Shampoo. He felt infatuation without trust. He felt  betrayal and lust. He felt himself falling in love for the wrong  reasons.</p><p>To prevent this, he needed to stop himself, and it meant  leaving the Xi Fa Xiang Gao manipulation interfering with his sex drive  alone. Releasing a year of passion made his body uncontrollable, and  Ranma couldn't 'ride it out' since the barrier and feelings bottled  inside returned tomorrow.</p><p>Hiding in Ukyo's embrace was futile.  His best friend didn't feel dangerous or half-way forbidden, and wasn't  nearly that intense. She felt safe and comforting. Ucchan only  awkwardly slept with Ranma as a girl right now, a pale substitute for  Shampoo's wildness.</p><p>With his perfection of the techniques, Ranma wanted to know what everyone didn't remember.</p><p>"Kami-sama!" Screamed Akane in murderous rage. "Ryouga is P-chan!"</p><p>Holding Akane while she broke down, Ranma could feel only contempt for Shampoo.</p><p>"Ranma  this is all Shampoo's fault! I'm sorry! All this time, when you and  Ryouga were telling me the truth, I tuned it out completely."</p><p>Those  words, he never expected them out of Akane's mouth. 'Good thing she  doesn't quite remember Ryouga's real conversations with me. The pig'd  bacon for sure then!'</p><p>"Zounds! It seems the might Blue Thunder did lose in battle; how could this be? Saotome isn't really a sorcerer?"</p><p>"Does this mean you finally realize I have a curse, and there is no pig-tailed girl?" Ranma-chan's hope illuminated her face.</p><p>"Don't  be ridiculous my love. Obviously that foul hypnotist Saotome sent  whatever tampered with my memories. He might not be a sorcerer, but the  only way for me to lose is bewitchment! I will not allow it! Now, with  my weakness acknowledged, I can learn from my mistakes and free you  from his clutches at last!"</p><p>Sighing, Ranma left the ranting Kuno  behind; Shampoo had obviously over-estimated his intelligence when she  covered all the bases.</p><p>"I remember now... Ranma-sama get out of the way!"</p><p>A black mist rose from Kodachi's body, primarily from her head, and coalesced into a cloud of mouths, teeth, and eyes.</p><p>"By the nine spokes of heaven, grant me skill to overcome the corruption of eternity!"</p><p>With a flash, the Devil Hunter stood triumphant, and summoned her weapon, prey in sight.</p><p>"Sharp  Edge of Nirvana!" Ranma threw hundreds of tendrils of ki at the demon,  each different in emotion, intensity, power, and size. The thing  belched forth a black wall of infernal power, which absorbed most of  the attack. Those threads not affected, passed straight though the  creature, destroying a wall of Kodachi's bedroom.</p><p>"Brute force won't banish a Sanity Drinker, please stay clear Ranma!" Kodachi's clipped tone bespoke intense concentration.</p><p>As  the demon turned its attention back onto the Devil Hunter, she struck.  Her blade glowing sky blue, she slashed the air around the thing into a  seal. The constraint flew together with a thundering reverberation. The  cloud of fangs spat black darkness from twenty mouths in answer, but  the counter merely sizzled against the binding's structure before  fading into a brimstone stench.</p><p>The seal quickly encircled the  mouths and teeth, holding them tightly, while dozens of mismatched eyes  glared malevolently at the prison. Dark cracks appeared in the bindings.</p><p>"By the silvery storms of righteous, I banish thee from this existence. Return to thy own aspect!"</p><p>As  the constraining ward disintegrated, Kodachi cleaved the entity in two,  and the smaller half vanished with a belch of brimstone smoke.</p><p>The  larger remainder, now the size of a dog, staggered backwards under a  beam of stark white serene ki. Startled, Ranma noticed the edge of his  attack had turned gray, the corruption spreading back up the beam. He  jumped away, releasing the attack, and watched an ethereal mouth snap  shut over where he had stood.</p><p>With another glowing slash, the  Devil Hunter banished more of the creature. The remainder of the entity  collapsed into a small smoky balloon, and shot through the roof into  the sky. It veered crazily, avoiding the yellow sacred lighting flying  from Kodachi's bracelet. Then it disappeared.</p><p>"Normally demons  like that are no bigger than a mouse." The gymnast's voice became  conversational as she switched back. "It held me for months, growing  off my psyche. It must be destroyed before it splits; the ripening  could infect dozens, maybe even hundreds!"</p><p>"Does this mean you no  longer want to marry me Kodachi?" Not even he recognized the emotions  in his voice - hope, relief, accomplishment, and respect.</p><p>"Ranma-sama,  all I wanted was cheap, mindless sex with you after five romantic  dates." Kodachi sighed. "Devil hunters can't marry or have steady  boyfriends until their calling leaves them, lest their dear ones come  in the crossfire. I, for one, refuse to die a virgin, and I have your  mother's permission."</p><p>"So what did you remember anyway?"</p><p>"Everything about magic transformations was hidden from me. That my relic didn't choose another is a small miracle."</p><p>"If we had the chance to redo that battle, what would you have me do different?"</p><p>"I don't suppose you know magic aside from changing gender?"</p><p>"No, it started as a curse, really."</p><p>"Unless  you can learn some minor spells of purification and holding, you aren't  useful except as a distraction. Life energy can't harm a Sanity  Drinker; they can only be hurt by magi, weapons of power, or crushing  will."</p><p>"What now for you?"</p><p>"I must regain my life; these  last months I haven't been myself. If it is not too much to ask, I  would like to remain with you the rest of this day. You are a pleasant  anchor."</p><p>Nodding, Ranma took Kodachi's hand, and they walked together, out of the devastation.</p><p>When confronted about 'granting permission' Nodoka smiled crookedly and laughed, holding the back of her head.</p><p>'Wow, that stupid looking nervous gesture must be genetic!' Kodachi's thoughtful revelation passed by unnoticed.</p><p>A  swirling ball of purple and pink ki hovered in front of Happosai. "Very  well Master Ranma, we may continue this challenge if you like."</p><p>"Yes  son-in-law, if you can defeat me, you will be admitted as an honorary  Amazon of my house. Then if you so choose, Shampoo's claim on you will  be invalid, with no loss of face for either of you."</p><p>An  impulsive decision, but it felt right. The self-application of Xi Fa  Xiang Gao Shiatsu, variation 337, was a blessing and a problem. A must  on his wedding night, but before then . . . . forbidden! 'I must have a  reason for sealing the technique, but I can't remember. Gotta trust  myself.' Ranma felt a tingling sensation near his waist when thinking  about Shampoo, but paid it no attention.</p><p>'Uncured,' Ranma Saotome  began an intricate kata under zazen... the Old Ghoul's artifact had  easily won her the fight, and the perv could use telekinesis with ki.  Why at this rate, he'd never get around finishing his hardest training  exercise: the single-handed hostile takeover of the American military  base. The Amaguriken could only block the bullets from two guns at once  right now, and that was with intuitive ki-deflection. . . . . .</p><p>Next: "Battling and Becoming"</p><p>-Xi  Fa Xiang Gao Shiatsu and Xia Fang Gao Shiatsu are the two spellings I  have seen. In the manga it is 114/411 with antidote 119/911 depending  on how you read it. The anime uses 110, which I adopted for simplicity.</p><p>-hiba-chan means grandmother</p>
