</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Ten: Close Calls</p><p>The velvet green landscape  of the park had boiled away to be replaced by a haunting darkness, as Copy-chan  succumbed to the overpowering effects of the Sake of Love. Her body, highly aroused  by a suicide cocktail of aphrodisiacs slipped to her by Kuno, was going into  shock from the addition of that extremely alcoholic potion. She was already  well disconnected from reality when Kuno noticed that she had passed out and  stopped to administer another helping of sexual stimulants and the rest of the  potion, in the hopes of getting her fired up again. The sensation of his hands  closing around her neck, trying to massage her throat into swallowing, opened a  door into an untapped portion of her inherited psyche. The nightmare which  unfolded surrounded her with steep, exotic mountains and a misty, spring  riddled valley. The same image had flitted through her mind when Ranma  explained his trip to Jusenkyo and how he had received his curse. Not that she  could really think about it, because in this nightmare a large and powerful man  was doing his very best to strangle her while tearing her clothes away.</p><p>She found herself struggling against defilement and  unconsciousness.</p><p>She sensed that she was not alone in her predicament.  Nearby, other women were being assaulted by the significantly larger group of  men they had stumbled across in their attempt to flee from one ambush, only to  stumble right into another. A riot of voices, male and female, shouting and  screaming in Mandarin, offered her the only hint of what was going on, as her  vision went black. Mere moments away from passing out and becoming defenseless  against rape, the man atop of her was roughly jerked away.</p><p>"Idiot! The prince wants Fa Shen intact!"</p><p>"I just wanted some fun before we kill her," the man  complained, bitterly, nursing a bruised jaw.</p><p>"We need a virgin for the sacrifice, moron!"</p><p>Copy-chan rolled onto her side, gasping and blinking as she  tried to regain her senses. The sound of Mandarin seemed long familiar, but she  was not used to any of it making sense. As she wondered how she could  understand the voices, she found herself wishing she had been left ignorant of  her fate. Before she could pull herself together, the new man kicked her in the  gut.</p><p>"Get up, Fa Shen! It's time for you to pay for your  tribe's crime!"</p><p>A group of men stormed over as she curled on her side in  pain. One of them leaned close to the man who kicked her and exchanged a few  whispers, as the rest of the group grabbed her and dragged her to her feet. She  managed to focus her eyes and look up. The man who kicked her had an oddly  feline cast to his features. His deference in speech and manner suggested that  the individual conferring with him was the aforementioned prince. She focused  on the prince, taking in his elegant and exotic features. He looked positively  draconian. Past him, she could make out a young man scowling at her. His  resemblance to her was astonishing, but only because it was less—or if you  considered the hair, more—perfect than that of Copy-kun, or Ranma in his true  form. The prince beckoned to the men holding her to drag her along as he  approached the man she was studying.</p><p>"Lo Shen, would you care to say anything to your little  sister before we proceed?" the prince addressed the red haired man as he  approached.</p><p>"What interest have I in the my traitorous mother's  bastard!" he declared hotly, turning his shoulder to her. The prince laughed  and gestured again at the men. Copy-chan was surprised as those men began  wrapping ropes, with heavy stone weights at their ends, around her body. She  finally found her voice.</p><p>"What do you think you're doing?"</p><p>"Replacing that which was destroyed, child!" the prince was  suddenly in her face. His hands reached up to caress her face. "May your beauty  and fire pass on to those who will be blessed by your grave."</p><p>She blinked in surprised confusion. "What?"</p><p>The men holding her dragged her around to face what her  "brother" had been studying before her arrival. It was a freshly dug spring.  She had a moment to wonder what was going on. Then it hit her. They were going  to drown her, make a new cursed spring. "Wait! Don't do this!"</p><p>"It is already done," the prince laughed as the men  behind Copy-chan shoved her hard. She braced her feet, forcing the men to try  harder. "You should have accepted my proposal. Now, I will have to make do with  just your likeness. Goodbye, Fa Shen." Annoyed by her resistance, one of the  men kicked at the back of her knees to break her footing. Copy-chan gasped for  breath as she hurtled toward the cold waters of death. It was hard not to waste  breath screaming in shock and outrage. As she sank to the depths, she struggled  against her bonds, desperate to escape this abominable fate. Unfortunately, her  exertion only depleted oxygen faster. The water was absorbed into the ropes  making them stronger, making her even own unusual strength useless. Just as she  realized that she was going to die, another part of her mind suddenly  understood that she had been dead for a long time.</p><p>As the nightmare came to it's conclusion, Ryouga,  startled and staring on in horror as the convulsions stopped and she became  still, crouched down and tried to find her pulse. While he fanned himself in  celebration at witnessing "Ranma's" death, Ranma and Kuno blundered through,  fighting.</p><p>While Ryouga slowly realized who lay dying before him,  all other thoughts left his mind. While he struggled to untangle the girl  before him from the person he otherwise might love to watch die—in theory if  not in fact—he completely forgot what he was doing there in the park, and whom  he was intended to be with. Unfortunately, Akari Unryuu had no other thoughts  on her mind. Past encounters with the lost boy had taught her that a great deal  of patience and effort were required in order to actually meet him. That said,  she had begun to learn how to detect clues to her ideal man's presence. Just  follow the sounds of demolition and conflict, and there was a good chance  Ryouga would be at the source. For that reason, she had been riding  Katsunishiki, her champion sumo pig, around the outskirts of the park.</p><p>At that moment, Akari and Katsunishiki were racing down  the sidewalk at that end of the park. Katsunishiki paused and turned as he  heard the sounds of Ranma and Kuno's battle and squealed to his master in  excitement. Akari perked her ears toward the park, and slid down from the giant  sumo pig's back, wondering if Ryouga had met one of his friends. With a strange  grin, she reminded herself that the group of martial artists, particularly  Ranma, was incomprehensibly drawn to conflict, and Ryouga's behavior became the  most incomprehensible when any of that group became involved. Sighing, Akari  cut into the park to see what the fighting was all about.</p><p>Ryouga was kneeling beside Ranma's twin, coming out of  his stupor. "Copy-chan," he breathed. At once, his gallant streak seized him.  He could not let this girl die just because of his grudge with Ranma. He started  doing CPR, and the force of his chest compressions popped the obstructions out  her mouth. Ryouga steeled his nerve to clamp his mouth over hers and give her  breath between compressions.</p><p>For roughly two minutes, the circulation of blood had  been arrested in Copy-chan's body. More than enough time to die, but not quite  enough for brain damage to begin. The first rush of blood into her cranium  flushed out poisonous levels of carbon-dioxide, and brought a hint of oxygen to  spark synapses. The euphoric tingle of suffocation, so similar to drowning,  rose in a painful crescendo as her body clamored for the return of her soul.  The first breath of air from Ryouga's lungs entered like a warm wind, washing  away the cold chill of a long forgotten death. The nightmare dissolved around  her, as Copy-chan was drawn back. The doors opened by her trauma slipping  closed once more. The feel of warm lips on hers was more urgent than  remembering to lock those doors behind her, as she awoke to her body's arousal.  As full consciousness returned to the her, the love potion kicked in and she  wrapped her arms around Ryouga, turning the kiss of life into a kiss of  passion.</p><p>Naturally, that was when Akane dragged the unconscious,  paralyzed Copy-kun into the clearing in search of Ranma. Equally well timed,  Akari and her giant pig entered the clearing from the other direction and  froze.</p><p>The lost boy was helpless before the passion of  Copy-chan's kiss. It did not help that he had just cleared the hurdle of  distinguishing her as a separate entity from Ranma, and a real girl to boot. He  had also just corrected the memory of his first kiss, attributing it to her  instead of Ranma. He could hardly be blamed then, after having failed to  express his appreciation of that first kiss, for trying to make up for it  whole-heartedly now. His arms slipped around her, and he pulled her up,  practically into his lap, as he found it in him to return the kiss with  interest. After a long, breathless moment, the girl had to part for air or risk  passing out again. The lost boy leaned back, a wide grin on his face, blinking  in wonder. At the third or fourth blink, he noticed others were present.  Looking left and right, he saw the last two people he could bear to confront at  a moment like this. Ryouga froze and shattered in the girl's iron grip.</p><p>Akane and Akari turned and departed, shock evident on  their faces.</p><p>Ryouga plummeted suddenly from the height of bliss to the  depths of despair. Reeling back, he let out a shout of utter betrayal,  unwittingly unleashing his ultimate Shishihokodan. Copy-chan, clinging to the  lost boy for dear life, felt the horrible weight of grief spilling out of the  boy, hurtling straight up into the air above them before crashing down on  everything at that end of the park, crushing the barely revived girl back into  unconsciousness. Ryouga was oblivious to the sphere of destruction, until he  saw the girl he had just revived sprawled on the ground, the last of her  tattered clothes blasted away by his chi attack. He didn't trust himself to touch  her, but risked two fingers on her neck to make sure he had not undone his  effort to save her. Finding a pulse, he sighed and backed away. After taking in  the extent of the damage from his outburst, the lost boy dug around until he  had located his traveling gear, and then proceeded to get lost with as much  haste as possible.</p><p>Akane made her way out of  the park, pausing to shift Copy-kun to a fireman's carry as she reached the  sidewalk, and tried to come to terms with what she had just seen. She remembered  all too well the events of the koi fishing rod. Despite Ryouga's later  explanations, that he had not believed the rod really worked and that he had  not hooked Ranma intentionally, she still remembered the many times she had  stumbled across Ryouga and Ranma in very compromising positions. She had even  heard Ryouga confess his true feelings to Ranma after freeing his rival from  the effects of the koi rod. Copy-chan had reminded Akane, painfully, of what  Ranma had been like under the compulsion to love Ryouga. More than once, Akane  had wondered if Ryouga's antipathy towards Ranma stemmed from the fact that he  had fallen in love with his rival's girl side. Ryouga had to know it would  never work. Ranma was just not like that. She hoped. Then there was Copy-chan.  Naturally, an all girl version of Ranma would show up when Ryouga was trying to  build a relationship with his new girlfriend Akari.</p><p>From the detonation of a full shishihokodan, it was  obvious that Ryouga was utterly devastated. That, more than anything, suggested  that things were not quite how they appeared. Not that it really explained what  had happened.</p><p>Poor Akari! She had given her heart entirely to Ryouga,  and more than once her love for the lost boy had been frustrated by the strange  relationship between Ryouga and Ranma. There could not be anything real there,  Akane tried to tell herself, but Ryouga managed to betray himself at the worst  possible times. Unfortunately, Ranma always helped create those situations, by  interfering with Ryouga. She tried not to wonder why her fiancé might go to  such extremes to mess with Ryouga, without some really perverted reason.</p><p>Seeing Akari leaning against her giant pig, further down  the side walk, she decided to go over and try to comfort her. Without warning,  Kuno's body burst through the trees, flying towards the horizon overhead. Akane  tracked the kendoist's flight, and decided that had to have been Ranma's work.  That meant that it had been Copy-chan in Ryouga's passionate embrace. Poor  Akari. This was going to take a lot of explaining. Of course, this was not the  first time something like this had happened. When she had witnessed Ryouga  crushing Ranma-chan in his arms, shouting "I love you" almost immediately after  Ryouga stopped taking offense at Akari's love of pigs, she had run away  believing Ryouga was in love with another woman. The fact that Ryouga had  simply responded to a subliminal command Ranma had implanted in the lost boy to  break the ice on their date, had not made it any better. She did not think that  had ever been explained, so Akari probably still believed there was another  girl. Dreading the prospect of trying to explain, Akane concentrated on just  distracting Akari for the moment.</p><p>"Akari-chan," she waved to the other girl. "Could I borrow  your pig to help carry this jerk home? If you would come along and stay for  tea, I might be able to explain what just happened back there," she offered.  She was not sure if Akari understood about Ranma's curse. She certainly did not  know about Copy-chan. Explaining Ryouga's action would require Akane to reveal  the truth about both of them, though she would just be guessing at what it all  really meant.</p><p>"Oh, Akane Tendo! Hi. I, uh… Sure. Katsunishiki would be  glad to help. I… I think it would be a good idea to sit down and do some  thinking too. That is, if Ryouga isn't there. I don't know if I could deal with  that right now."</p><p>"Things aren't what they seem," she assured with a  friendly smile. The explosion of heavy chi was enough to promise that. "If I  know Ryouga, he's probably headed for Okinawa by now." Akari just nodded  numbly. Akane could tell the girl was not ready to talk, and probably did not  even want to think about what she had just seen.</p><p>While the two girls lifted Copy-chan's unconscious form to  Katsunishiki's back, and tied him down, Ranma was rushing back to find out what  had happened to Copy-chan. Ranma-chan entered the clearing to find her twin  stark naked and unconscious in the middle of one of Ryouga's craters.</p><p>"Oh great. Ryouga probably thought she was me and  attacked her," he crouched down to check her vital signs. She was hot and  flushed, but her pulse and breathing were both strong. "At least you're  alright. For a sec there, I was afraid Kuno was tryin' to kill you," Ranma  muttered to the girl. Reminding herself to pay the lost boy back for leaving  her alone in this condition, Ranma-chan picked her double up and cradled her  close to her body. She paused a moment, wondering if she should check on Akane  and Ukyo, but she decided it was safer to not risk confronting Akane with the  naked girl in her arms. Rushing out of the park, and taking to the rooftops,  she made her best speed back to the Tendo Dojo.</p><p>Upon arriving at the dojo, the girl was still out cold,  so Ranma-chan took her into the furo. They were both covered in grime from  their fights, and Ranma could not think of any reason not to bathe both of them  at the same time. Though Copy-chan was all girl, her body was no mystery to  Ranma. She did not bother with hot water, or a soak in the furo, since  Copy-chan was in no condition to be immersed in a bath. She was dressed, and  had slipped her copy into a spare set of pajamas, by the time Akane and Akari  arrived. She was carrying the girl upstairs when they came in, bearing an  equally unconscious Copy-kun. Nabiki, who had met the girls on her way out to  the park and come back with them, led Akari into the tea room while Akane  followed Ranma-chan upstairs.</p><p>Akari had seen all three Ranmas during the shuffle, but a  surprised look was the limit of her immediate reaction. Ukyo showed up, looking  a little worse for wear as Akane and Ranma-chan returned from upstairs. The  clones were safely laid out in separate rooms to recover from the Kunos' drugs,  so the gang gathered around the table to relax.</p><p>Akari was glaring at Ranma-chan, wringing her hands under  the table. Akane, sitting next to her, leaned in and whispered. "It wasn't hi…  uh, her. It was the other one, the girl upstairs."</p><p>"Why are there two of you?" Akari demanded. "Does Ryouga  love her?"</p><p>"Um. The first part is kinda complicated," Ranma-chan  began. "What, uh… what happened between Copy-chan and Ryouga?"</p><p>"You didn't see it?" Akane rolled her eyes, not wanting  to mention what happened in front of Akari.</p><p>"I was too busy fighting Kuno. When I got around to  looking for her, Ryouga had blasted her with his shishihokodan."</p><p>Akari remembered that the other red-head had been  unconscious when they arrived. "Ryouga did that? I don't understand. They were  kissing when I got there. Why would he knock her out?"</p><p>"Probably because she kissed him. She's, um… sort of a  nymphomaniac. She keeps jumping people," Ranma grumbled, blushing.</p><p>Akari looked down into her lap, thinking. "She's very  pretty, and I've seen Ryouga get carried away with her before. Or was that  you?" she looked into Ranma-chan's eyes.</p><p>"Um, he's gotten weird with me a few times. But I ain't  interested! I am not like that. Stupid koi rod!" Ranma's mind wandered off. She  had eventually remembered the whole ordeal, and it still creeped her out that  Ryouga would try and mess with her like that. Kuno was one thing, but Ryouga  knew she was really a guy. Of course he had laughed with envy when he had first  learned of her curse. Thanks to Ryouga, Ranma had been forced to understand  that, because the plumbing existed, part-time or no, some guys would see her as  a girl in spite of the truth. "My, uh… twin hasn't been around long enough for  any kind of relationship with Ryouga, though she seems to end up kissing him a lot.  I am sure what ever you saw was her fault."</p><p>"Do you think so?" Akari looked hopeful, hands clasped  below her chin.</p><p>"Even if Ryouga has a crush on her, she's leaving for  good at the end of the week. He'll never see her again, and I ain't gonna let  anything like that go on between me and him!" Ranma-chan declared hotly.</p><p>Akari nodded and then looked at Akane, "I almost forgot  to ask, is Ranma-kun okay?" She had, after all, helped bring Akane's fiancée  home from the park and seen her carry him upstairs. Naturally she was surprised  when Ranma-chan answered automatically.</p><p>"Sheesh! I'm fine. Kuno'll never be a match for me!"</p><p>"Idiot," Nabiki breathed, while sipping her tea.</p><p>"Ano, I was talking about Akane's fiancé," Akari tried to  clarify.</p><p>"Heh, that was our fathers' idea. Hell, thanks to my  Pops, I am probably engaged to half the people in Tokyo!" Ranma fumed as Akane  put her head in her hands. Akari leaned close to Akane and spoke in a stage  whisper.</p><p>"Is she always like this?"</p><p>Ranma stared at the girls in confusion. All of a sudden  she realized that, while Akari knew about Ryouga's curse, she was oblivious to  Ranma's. Stiffening in alarm, she tried to cover it up, rubbing the back of her  head and laughing nervously, "Uh, hahaha! I was just kidding you know. I'm not  Ranma, of course! I'm Ranko! I wouldn't want to be engaged to a violent tomboy  like Akane! Oh no! Heheheheh… Ite!" She was cut off as Akane dropped the hammer  on her.</p><p>"And I wouldn't want to be engaged to a perverted jerk  like you!"</p><p>Akari reeled back in surprise.</p><p>"Some people never learn," Nabiki sighed.</p><p>The sound of movement upstairs caught their attention  before anything more could be said between Akane and Ranma.</p><p>"Uh oh. It sounds like they've woken up."</p><p>"We better go check on them," Ranma-chan bounced to her  feet.</p><p>When Akane and Ranma arrived upstairs, with the others  close behind them, they found the door to Akane's room open, and the shoji  leading to the guestroom closed. Sweeping it open, they saw the copies  struggling to undress each other without breaking from a heated kiss. Nabiki's  camera was out, clicking and whirring before the others could gasp. Akane was  as quick as ever to produce the pervert-pulverizer, but the two just rolled  around in their passionate embrace, unwittingly dodging as she struck.</p><p>"Wow, I guess she has this effect on a lot of guys,"  Akari murmured in astonishment. Despite her normal, feminine demeanor, she  stood there wide eyed, taking mental notes on how to apply these techniques in  her own pursuit of Ryouga, instead of showing the expected outrage personified  by Akane. Ukyo stood there shaking her head and clucking her tongue. It took a  cold bucket of water to get the couple's attention, by which point their  clothes were safe from such dousing, scattered all over the room. While Akane  and Ranma rushed them back into their clothes, Nabiki put away her camera and  led Akari and Ukyo downstairs. Akane and the Ranmas soon joined them.</p><p>"We can't even leave you alone unconscious! What is it with  you two! Wasn't a date with each other and the Kunos enough to satisfy you?"  Ranma-chan nagged the sheepish pair.</p><p>"I can't help it. Whatever Kuno was feeding me gave me  all these weird urges!" Copy-chan protested, as her opposite nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Those two are psycho! The least someone could have done  was warn us!" Copy-kun grumbled, as he flopped down at the table. He joined  Copy-chan in glaring at Ranma, having long since reached the conclusion that  the Kunos had been drawn to them because of the original. "What have you done  with those two to get them so obsessed with you!"</p><p>"I didn't do nothin'! They're both just crazy!" Ranma  retorted.</p><p>"How could you set us up with them!"</p><p>"It wasn't me! It was Nabiki's idea. She thought she  could get them off my back, and split you two up by arranging this. I had  nothing to do with it!" The duplicates looked at Nabiki, who was looking  innocent and shocked at the accusation, and returned their disbelieving glares  to Ranma-chan. The two proceeded to pound on Ranma as payback for setting the  pair of psychos on them. When Ranma-chan was reduced to incoherent mumblings of  pain, they sat back and huffed.</p><p>"I don't care if you threaten to kill us again. There's  no way I'm going to have anything to do with that Kodachi again!"</p><p>"I'd rather die than so much as speak to Kuno again. And  that goes for following you to school anymore. No way! Not as long as he's  gonna be there!" Copy-chan crossed her arms. She was pretty hazy about what  happened at the end of the date, but whatever it was frightened her to the  bone.</p><p>Ranma perked up. "Do you meant it?" He sagged in relief  when they nodded vigorously. "Well. I can't let you out of going to school, or  I have to cut too. Pops will kill me if I do that. Kodachi might still be a  problem, but you have my permission to clobber Kuno on sight, that okay with  you?"</p><p>"Sure. I'll make him hate me if it's the last thing I  do!" Copy-chan swore.</p><p>"You'd be doing everyone a favor!" Ranma assured, smiling  brightly. "Except for Nabiki. Kuno's her best customer." The clones looked at  him in confusion. Ranma pulled a stack of pictures he had "liberated" from one  of his classmates after lunch. Wordlessly, he handed them to the couple. They  looked at them in shock, seeing images from the night before. There were dozens  of shots of Ranma-chan and Copy-chan in various states of wearing lingerie, a  few snaps of both copies in the furo together, and scenes of their combat with  Ranma from later that evening.</p><p>"What's this all about?"</p><p>"Hey, a girl's got to make a living somehow," Nabiki  smiled. Before Ranma could waste any more effort trying to convince them of her  nefarious doings, she admitted that she had sold some information to the Kuno  siblings which might have precipitated their decision to propose dating the  couple. "I certainly didn't arrange the dates. I just let them know that the  two of you might return their affection if they could earn your trust. You two  can't have a real relationship together, right?"</p><p>"I'm not sure what we have together, but it's a hell of a  lot better than any kind of involvement with them," Copy-chan brooded. Still,  part of Nabiki's point got through. For whatever reason, she found her thoughts  revolving around Ryouga. She could remember a brief moment in his arms, sharing  a most glorious kiss. "I might be interested in finding someone else, I just  don't know if he's really interested."</p><p>Akari turned and glared at Copy-chan.</p><p>Akane cut in at once, "I don't think you should be  thinking about starting any kind of relationships. Ranma has enough trouble  without you two going and starting things with people while you are here. It's  not fair to leave Ranma to deal with all of that!"</p><p>"What are you talking about!"</p><p>"You don't seriously think you're going to be around long  enough for anything serious to happen, do you? You both go back at the end of  the week." Ranma glared at the duplicates until they both looked away. It would  have been hard to say which of the three was the most upset and disturbed at  the moment. The situation seemed cruel and unfair to all of them, and  threatened to make them think about things they did not want to. Things that  had gone unsaid about who and what they were, or should be, to each other.</p><p>Later that evening, as Ranma  was getting ready for bed, the copies sought him out. The three of them had  dropped out of the conversation, wandering outside to think while Akane, Ukyo  and Nabiki talked to Akari about her relationship with Ryouga. Something about  the mood affecting the trio had kept even Ukyo from pressing them with her  attention. She had finally left, with Akari, resolving to have a serious talk  with each of them when she could get them alone. They had remained subdued  through dinner. Food might have roused them from their depression, but Genma  had limited his food fighting to Copy-kun, ignoring the other two. Ranma had  plummeted back into a deep funk at this silent rejection, dragging the other  two down after him. The copies did not even realize that they withered under  the implied disapproval of their existence. Ranma was almost aware of feeling  terrible for holding their origins in him against them. He just could not  completely separate them from himself. That made it harder for him to threaten  them with banishment. His conscience kept asking him how he would feel if the  people around him wished he did not even exist.</p><p>As they crept into his room, he sighed. Did he hate them?  He looked up. They drove him crazy. They were impossible to control, but he  could not hate them without hating himself. "Why does this stuff always happen  to me?" he asked under his breath. Shaking his head, he raised his voice, "What  do you want now?"</p><p>"Sex…" Copy-kun began, forgetting how he was going to  bring up the subject they had agreed to question Ranma about. Ranma was lunging  for his throat before he could even form the question on his mind.</p><p>"Stop it!" Copy-chan darted between the boys, ending up  face to face with Ranma, and between his arms. Ranma recoiled, scuttling back  to the wall. She half turned and slapped her compatriot on the head, "That  wasn't what you were supposed to say!"</p><p>"Ow! It wasn't supposed to come out like that," he rubbed  his head and looked at Ranma. "I meant, well, sex is what you're all afraid of,  right? That's what you don't want me and her trying to do."</p><p>Ranma considered this for a moment and relaxed. He  remembered feeling, for a moment, the desire to open up to Ukyo at school. He  was also feeling bad about getting so angry with the copies when he knew they  could not help themselves. Swallowing, he decided to do something he rarely  considered. Talk. With a deep breath, he confided, "I don't even care to talk  about sex. I don't wanna think about it. But how can I avoid it with the two of  you running around tryin' one stupid thing after another?"</p><p>The couple sighed. Copy-chan looked at him, "It took us a  while to figure out that this was about sex, not love. I still don't understand  why they're connected, or, why 'making love' or 'having sex' is such a bad  thing."</p><p>"It… it's not, really. It's a good thing, if you love  someone. If you're a normal guy or a normal girl. But if you're like me…" Ranma  trailed off. He shook his head. "That's the problem with Kuno and Kodachi. They  don't see me as a person. I am an object to them, a thing to play with, to make  their sick fantasies come true. They're dangerous, because they don't know the  meaning of the word 'love' and almost as little about sex. They want to  possess, control, conquer, cuz that's all they understand."</p><p>"You don't need to tell us that it's dangerous to mess  with those two. But, you have to tell us why you… what you…" Copy-chan uttered  a strangled scream of frustration. She bowed her head, daring her own  confession. "We're so lonely. We're only here because of you, but because of  you we're not even real people to anyone. I… I have all these feelings, these  desires I don't understand, and they're all I have to go on. But if I follow  where they lead, you… everyone gets upset. I can't take it."</p><p>Copy-kun put a hand on her shoulder, pulling her back  against his chest. Ranma was staring at them, shock and disbelief mixing with  some hint of sympathy. "I don't remember anything before stepping out of the  mirror," he volunteered. "For me, the world begins with seeing her. Seeing her  joy at my appearance. For one moment, I had a reason to exist, and the promise  of fulfillment. Since then, things have gone to hell."</p><p>"You've got that right," Ranma sighed.</p><p>"I never meant to… do… what I did to you, Ranma. You say you're  a guy. That being a girl is your curse. I just can't help seeing her when I  look at you in that form. To me, you are a copy of her, not the other way  around. She's the real thing, and I… I want her. Because I am lonely and she's  the one person I can trust." He looked away before continuing, "I can't tell  you how horrible it was to be with her, to hold her and kiss her, and then find  out it was you."</p><p>"How do you think I felt, huh!"</p><p>"I can't imagine. The idea of actually being a girl is  too… weird… for me to really understand. I would hate to be in your place. At  the same time, it's… I dunno. It's kinda neat!"</p><p>"You've gotta be kidding me! You freaked out when you  thought you would have the curse too!"</p><p>"Yeah. I did. It's okay for a girl to be a girl, but… how  can a guy be a girl without giving up being a guy? Wouldn't I just be a girl  who only thought she was a guy? A girl who couldn't deal with what she was?"</p><p>Ranma flinched, but understood the thought too well. In  the darker hours of his life, he found himself asking questions like that. "So  what is that supposed to mean! You think I'm a girl pretending to be a guy!"</p><p>"Only when you're a girl, Ranma. I am sorry, I know you  don't wanna hear somethin' like that, but… that's just how my mind deals with  it. I could not have touched you like that if I saw you as a guy," he shrugged.</p><p>"Thanks, that makes me feel so much better," Ranma  growled.</p><p>"Ranma," Copy-chan slipped away from her counterpart and  approached the original. "I'm not a guy, I've never even considered I could be  a guy, even if I come from you. Yin and Yang, it's a part of all of us, so I  don't understand why you can't deal with being a girl. I don't understand, but  I think that's the reason you can't stand the idea of me having sex with him."</p><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><p>"You said it the other night, you don't think we're real  people. We're parts of you and even if we're both being controlled by the ghost  of some dead woman, it's still you that's involved. Right?"</p><p>Ranma stared at them, pondering. "Maybe."</p><p>"And so what's really bothering you is that it would be  like you having sex with yourself if we did it."</p><p>Ranma nodded hesitantly.</p><p>"So, we want to know what's wrong with that?"</p><p>"Do you have to have it explained to you!" Ranma was incredulous.</p><p>"Yes. Exactly."</p><p>Ranma opened his mouth to give them an earful of reasons,  but suddenly he could not really think of any. The truth was, the situation  supposedly could never actually come up. Only in his case, it was a constant  shadow over him. He tried to avoid facing the fact that he was as much female  as he was male. Thanks to Kuno's warped imagination, he had been forced to  picture one with the other and in that moment, one side confronting the other,  had not known which side he was supposed to be on. Just trying to imagine it  had left him feeling torn in two. He had experienced the same agony, ten times  over, when he saw the two of them making out before lunch. Taking a shaking  breath, he tried to put his fear into words, "I am afraid that it would tear me  apart."</p><p>They stared at him in shock.</p><p>"There's more. I can't explain it, but every time he put  the moves on me, it was like he sucked the guy right out of me," he muttered,  staring into the corner of the room. "Because of you," he flicked a glare at  Copy-kun, "I really did become a girl…" Ranma curled up, hugging his knees to  his chest.</p><p>"When…  when that  happened, when you felt like that, did you hate it?" Copy-chan asked, hoping to  make her point.</p><p>"No. I loved it. That's the problem," Ranma sighed.</p><p>"I don't understand."</p><p>"You don't know about the promise to my mother," Ranma  lowered his head. While Ranma was very uneasy about admitting to embracing his  femininity, it was not a unique occurrence. Who he was really did not change  that much according to gender. He had learned that from the koi fishing rod  experience. Pretending to be Ranko had led to an occasional lapse as well. His  mother had helped encourage the girl in him, and if she ever learned the truth,  would kill him for it. Pulling himself together, he sat down and explained his  father's promise to his mother.</p><p>AN: While at least one person has claimed that the "Two  Ranmas" story arc takes place after Nodoka learned the truth, this is not  correct. In the original manga, the truth finally comes out in Volume 36 (Parts  3-8). Also, one notable complaint against the premise of the copies being "just  like Ranma" has been made. This is not from lack of imagination, but because  the connection of the copies to Ranma is important to the story that evolves  from here. Some of you will note the brief glimpse of the creation of the  Nyannichaun, and yes, this has been explored in dozens of stories before this.  Rather than worry about being totally original, I am more interested in using  the ideas I have to tell the story I have in mind. It's not about the pieces,  but how they all fit together, really…</p>
