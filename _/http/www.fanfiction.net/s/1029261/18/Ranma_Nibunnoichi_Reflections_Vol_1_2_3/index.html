</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Eighteen: Coming to a Crossroads</p><p>An oddity of the human  psyche lends the hour of awakening an eternal quality. In that critical period,  a person could easily find her mind displaced in time by days, months or years.  Akane was hardly immune to this phenomenon, rising naturally from troubled  slumber in which the events of the past two weeks were revisited and filed with  great relief under the header of dreams. Another oddity of the human psyche she  unwittingly demonstrated, was the capacity to overlook inconvenient reminders  of an unpleasant reality, such as the pillows, futon and comforter testifying  to the fact that Ranma-chan and Ranko had slept in her room with her. Blinking  and yawning, carrying her bath supplies, she shuffled blindly past that  obstacle and made her way down stairs. She had gotten into the habit of  hurrying downstairs to claim the bath while Ranma sparred with his father.  Passing by the Tea Room, glimpsing Ranma and Ryouga conversing in muted voices as  Kasumi poured tea, and judging it too early for Nabiki, Genma (in the absence  of a sparring session), or her father to be awake, she concluded it was  perfectly safe to enter the bath, ignoring the occupied sign hanging in the  washroom. Altogether, her state of denial lasted about eight minutes.</p><p>For one whole minute, which Ranma-kun and Ranko spent  frozen in apprehension, Akane struggled to catch up with events sufficiently to  utter the appropriate phrases of outrage inspired by the boy and girl sharing the  furo.</p><p>When the minute elapsed, and no coherent noise escaped  Akane, Ranko cleared her throat and blushed, "If you're going to just stand  there, you might wanna put on a robe or something."</p><p>Akane eeped, stepped back and slammed the shoji closed. A  second later, the screen shot open and she stormed in wearing an oversized  t-shirt. "What the hell are you two doing in the bath together!" she demanded,  fuming in outrage and embarrassment, while her eyes darted around for an  implement of destruction.</p><p>Ranma-kun, who had managed to snap his eyes shut in the  first few seconds of the show, carefully remained silent, sinking a little  deeper into the water.</p><p>"Do you want an answer before or after you pound us into  oblivion?"</p><p>Akane finally picked up the sprayer and aimed it at the  boy. While not being deliberately malicious, it had recently been filed in her  mind as a punitive weapon suitable for use in this situation. The remembered  trauma of experiencing the triggers to the curse simultaneously caused both Ranma-kun  and Ranko to bound clear of the furo instantly. The sudden movement caused  Akane to clench her fist and flinch back from the wave of hot water, "Get back!  Perverts!" In a flash, in more than once sense, everyone in the room was female  and soaked. For Ranko, that was of course the status quo. Thus, she was the  first to respond again.</p><p>"Are you quite through?" she demanded, glaring into the  cold spray. Akane dropped the hose and opened her mouth, but Ranko cut her off.  "I don't wanna hear it, Akane. The answer to your question is, bathing. If you  think there's anything more to it, that's your problem. If you'd paid attention  to the sign in the washroom, it wouldn't even be that. As for what you just  tried to do," she narrowed her eyes to slits, "I hope you never experience the  kind of pain you just threatened to hand out!"</p><p>Akane puffed up in indignation and began to roar,  "Ranma…!"</p><p>"Ranko!" the girl screamed back, drowning her out.  "Didn't you see me! I'm in hot water up to my eyeballs and you're goin'  ballistic cuz SHE," her finger snapped out to point in Ranma-chan's direction,  "forgot she could still become a guy, even though she can no longer be him  anymore!" Ranma-chan cringed at that and turned away from the confrontation.  Until Ranko shouted it, she would not have admitted to herself that she had  been taking refuge in her recently discovered feminine psyche to dull the pain  of losing her real identity. Now that it was spoken, she suddenly could not  meet Akane's eyes. Ranko was not done, however. "If you're not gonna even  bother tryin' to understand what you're jumpin' into, maybe you oughta learn to  stop rushin' blindly into the middle of everything!"</p><p>Akane recoiled from the combined outbursts as though they  were an onslaught of physical blows. She spun and fled through the open door,  leaving a mist of tears to fall in a line behind her.</p><p>As Ranma-chan turned around, Ranko folded to the tiles  and burst into tears herself. Ranma-chan bit her lip, catching a rebuke at the  last second. Ranko was well aware that she had been too harsh. Feeling how  fragile her own emotions seemed, she slumped down beside her twin and held onto  her somewhat helplessly. It was frightening. The changes they were going  through were taking their toll. When Soun stormed down stairs and into the  bathroom, driven from his bed by the sound of Akane slamming into her room and  exploding into loud wails of grief, he took one look at the naked girls  struggling to master their shattered feelings and backed out without a peep. When  Ranko recovered, the two girls got dressed and timidly slipped up to the  breakfast table. Sitting in his usual spot, Soun was staring into his tea  looking shell shocked. Neither of the girls could meet the eyes of Ranma and  Ryouga as they waited for the morning meal to appear.</p><p>Ranma-chan sighed after a moment, thankful of one thing.  Akane's intrusion had shaken both of them out of their thoughts about Fa Shen.  The realization got her mind back on that track, but hopefully Ranko would not  join her in that contemplation. Ranko had enough to deal with. The prospect of  becoming a stranger to herself, by embracing a long dead expression of herself,  was too much to add to her problems. It made more sense for Ranma-chan to take  on that challenge. She had the least to lose under the present circumstances.  Becoming someone else was beginning to look like an ideal way out of this  absurd situation. Unfortunately, she was not the only one "looking out" for  Ranko.</p><p>Ranma cleared his throat to get their attention. "Ranko,"  he waited for her to meet his eyes. "Could I speak to you alone for a moment?"  He gestured for Ranma-chan to stay out of it when she went to open her mouth.  Ranko took a deep breath and nodded. "Come on. Let's go out to the dojo."</p><p>Ranko rose stiffly to her feet and followed him out of  the house, expecting to hear some lecture or demand for her to explain her  verbal assault on Akane. To her surprise, he began to fidget and blush once  they were alone.</p><p>"Well? What did you wanna talk about?"</p><p>"I need to ask you some things," he began, trying to find  a way to approach his proposal. "I guess the first thing is, I've had to face  what's ahead of you, but I'm not really sure how you feel right now. Are you  okay with bein' Ranko? I mean, taking the identity, bein' a girl for real… for  Mom?"</p><p>Ranko arched back slightly in surprise, wondering what he  was really after, to start with a question like that. "That was the idea,  wasn't it?" she retorted easily, buying herself time to think while he scowled  at her and tried to explain what he was asking. While he reiterated some of the  things that had been said the previous couple of days, she composed her  thoughts.</p><p>"…So it's not like I think you have'ta," he was  concluding, "I just wanna know if you're gonna give it a try or if you plan to  go to China as soon as we have this other problem straightened out."</p><p>"I am not doin' as good as, um, Ranma-chan, at tryin' a  female perspective," she confessed, looking down. "I mean, she figured out how  to do it, but I've been afraid to really try. She can be a guy, but all I can  do is hold onto the memory of it. I'm afraid if I let go of that, I won't ever  wanna go back to bein' me, exactly." Looking up she shrugged and shook her  head, "No, not just that. I guess what I'm really afraid of is that I won't  become Ranko in truth, but that I'll slide all the way until I become HER," she  emphasized, trusting him to know who she meant.</p><p>He looked at her seriously, as he allowed the fear to  unfold for himself. He had tried not to think about Cologne's revelation. The  idea that he was a girl before ever being born as a guy was disturbing. Worse,  she had been an amazon. Even in his sleep, his mind had retreated from  nightmares that made him feel like he hated himself. Instead of following that  topic, he addressed her previous concern. "So you really wanna be a guy again?"  He knew he would, in her place. Just because he had been female—even a girl, in  another life—and might be able to be one again, he did not particularly want  to. Not if he could help it.</p><p>Ranko shrugged. "I'm not so sure it's as important, if I  can't really be me," she stressed. Even if she could somehow manage it, and  become Ranma's "twin brother", it would not be the same as being Ranma. It  would be easier to hold onto her identity as Ranko, if she could be sure that  was as far as she would slip. "If I could figure out how Mom would feel about  having another son, I wouldn't feel like I was giving up everything just to be  a guy. If I didn't know how much she wants a daughter…" she trailed off. It  need not be said again that she was the perfect choice to assume that responsibility.  Shaking her head, she crossed her arms and stared at him, "I don't have an easy  answer. Why did you want to know?"</p><p>"Well," he began, scratching the back of his head, "if you  are serious about bein' Ranko, or at least figuring out if you can, I have a…  an idea, I guess. A proposal."</p><p>Her eyes widened for a moment, then narrowed. "What do  you mean?"</p><p>"Ryouga wants to ask you out," Ranma sighed.</p><p>"I'm not sure that's a good idea right now," she frowned,  looking away.</p><p>"I'm not sure it's a good idea to avoid it," he retorted  gently. "I know the feelings are there. I feel it, but I can't do anything  about it. Weird as it is, I feel about the same for Ryouga as I do Akane. We might  all prefer to be guys, but only one of us can be with her. If there were no one  else, that would be a real problem. Also, it would not be as complicated with  Ryouga. There's no one else pressuring you into it, and he's bein' more open  about his feelings than Akane. At least you have some clue if anything will  ever come of it, while I'm never sure about her," he pointed out.</p><p>"But, this is Ryouga, man!"</p><p>"Yeah. I know, as a guy the idea is kinda sickening, but  as a girl…" he shrugged. "As a girl there's nothing wrong with it. You could do  a lot worse than Ryouga, and he needs someone who can understand and respect  him."</p><p>"I just can't believe he'd even ask," she shuddered,  feeling a bit angry that he had not respected her request for time.</p><p>"It wasn't his idea," Ranma responded. He explained how  Ryouga approached him, and how he had been prompted to act as a way of helping  Ranko. "The whole idea is to help you. It's enough just to ask, really, but  he's ready to follow through, all the way, if that's what you want. If that's  what you need. I think he's as scared of the idea as you."</p><p>"But you came to me with this," she pointed out. "You  think I should do this. I don't think you'd have done that if you hadn't asked  yourself first."</p><p>He sighed and gave a slight nod.</p><p>"So you already know what I'll say."</p><p>He nodded. After staring into each other's eyes in  silence for a moment, he turned away, "I'll tell him it's okay to ask."</p><p>Ranko watched him return to the house. She slowly sank  down to sit on her heels. It was both horrifying, and a relief, to find herself  at this crossroad. The possibility had haunted her since the first time she had  explored her cursed form. The silent friction of her hands on her own skin had  whispered to her that this body had a purpose of its own, and a day would  inevitably come when it would find a way to reveal itself to her. A day when  something would compel her to accept that the change was more than skin deep.  All that was required was for her to be put into a perfectly plausible position,  and recognize that it applied to her. Ryouga was on his way out to ask a girl  on a date. When he appeared in the door, looking nervous and determined, she  could not deny that she was that girl. Trying not to look as though she stared  death in the face, she turned her eyes up to meet his.</p><p>Ranma-chan had studied  Ryouga for several long moments, when her reflections departed, before excusing  herself from the breakfast table. She had a dreadful suspicion of what Ranma  and Ranko were discussing and had not been prepared for the stab accompanying  the realization that Ranma and Ryouga had not even considered her in their  scheme. The sensation of doors closing to her was becoming painfully palpable.  Ironically, she could guess what had brought this on, and could see that Ranko  needed it more than she. She had never wanted to fight more than she did for  the identity of Ranma, and yet she had forced herself to admit that it was a  futile effort from the beginning. That realization had allowed her to embrace  the identity she lost to Ranko even before Ranko realized it for herself. Along  with the man who fell in love with that identity. It was this clarity that  allowed her to understand what had really happened in the bathroom only moments  ago. She wished she could break away from Akane as well, but instead she found  herself at the girl's door hoping to offer in friendship what she was never  able to offer as a fiancé.</p><p>Maybe one had to become a true outcast to comprehend the  value of unconditional love. Or maybe what she felt was part of the process of  coming undone, a gift realized in the same breath as the onset of death.  Tightening her fist, she promised, "Curse be damned. I will not die. I might  lose everything I know and love, but I'll find a way to survive!"</p><p>"Ranma?" came a muffled voice from the other side of the  door. The faint sobbing had stopped.</p><p>"A friend," Ranma-chan answered, sighing.</p><p>A moment later, the door opened. Akane looked at her with  horribly swollen, red eyes and a damp face. "What do you want?" she growled in  pain.</p><p>"I…" she looked away. She originally intended to  apologize for Ranko and explain the girl's attack, but suddenly wanted to be  rid of this sense of collective responsibility. The truth was, she was in pain,  and misery loved company. Rather than try to explain, she just relaxed the mask  she had built to maintain a masculine façade against the emotional nature of  her current form. Without warning, her eyes filled up with tears and she  breathed, "A friend."</p><p>Akane gave her an odd look, unable to believe the cascade  of tears streaming from Ranma-chan's eyes. She could not help but remember the  conversation she had with Ranma on the way to Tofu's the morning before. Faced  with the prospect of losing his identity to the reflections, he had expressed  the hope of claiming the friendship she had promised Ranma-chan in their first  meeting. Taking a breath, she pushed aside her own pain and asked gently, "What  happened?"</p><p>Ranma-chan sighed and shrugged. "Ranko's claiming the  other half," she explained simply. She had not witnessed it, but she felt in  her bones that it was happening. Ryouga's nervous and eager air had betrayed  enough for her to know what Ranma would ask Ranko, and she needed no help  figuring out what her answer would be. Ultimately, the decision was based on  her honor, so there was only one choice for the girl to make.</p><p>Akane considered the response and pulled Ranma-chan into  her room. Closing the door, she acted on impulse and hugged the other girl. At  the moment, that's what she was. Ranma-chan allowed herself to be consumed by  silent, racking sobs. Even as she cried, she found herself amazed by the  emotional release. What was more surprising, when the fit finally ended some  time later, was the strange clarity that followed. Akane had allowed her own  tears to play out in the embrace, recognizing that Ranma-chan was there as much  to unburden Akane's grief as her own. While they slipped apart and moved in  silence to the bed, Ranma-chan pondered her current state of mind. By dropping  her guard completely, she had finally admitted the depth of her loss. And it  was devastating. There were suddenly no maps, no logic, to the terrain of her  life. The assumptions that went with all she had been, had been stripped away  as well. All she was left with was her determination to survive, and a sudden  sense that she had nothing left to lose, and everything to gain by trying.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Akane finally ventured.</p><p>"I can't remember the last time I cried like that," she  responded softly, allowing the wonder of it to enter her voice. "I had no idea  it could help so much to just let it all out. I mean, nothing's changed. My  life is still torn to hell, but it's like the fight is over. I'm a complete  mess, but there's nothing to stop me from pickin' up the pieces now."</p><p>"You said Ranko was claiming the other half," Akane  reminded. "What exactly does that mean? Why did that make you fall apart?"</p><p>Ranma-chan winced. She had enough pride left that she did  not like the way that sounded. Sighing she shook it off, "I did fall apart,  didn't I?" she forced herself to admit. Taking a breath, she tried to answer  the question. "It makes sense for her to be Ranko, but she… She was not ready  to accept it. When she lashed out at you, she was finally accepting that she  would not be Ranma ever again. Then Ranma…" she stopped and swallowed back a  new surge of tears. "I don't know how to explain it. Ranma and Ryouga were  waiting for us at the table. Ryouga was beside himself, and only got worse when  Ranma took Ranko out to the dojo. I can guess what's up with Ryouga, and if  Ranma's helping him, then I know what's going to happen. Ryouga's a problem I  can only figure out as a girl, and that's what's gonna cause Ranko to claim  that identity for real."</p><p>"But you expected that, didn't you?"</p><p>Ranma-chan sighed. "It's easy to figure out, but it's a  lot harder to live with. I'm runnin' out of things to hold on to, and I'm not  sure I'm gonna like what's left." Once again, the specter of Fa Shen rose up in  her mind. She laughed a bit harshly, "I got used to the idea of bein' a girl.  Maybe it won't be so hard to get used to bein' an entirely different person. I  just wish I had a better idea of who she is."</p><p>"Fa Shen?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Why would you have to become her?"</p><p>"It's not a choice. That's just what's left when you take  away the rest."</p><p>"I can't imagine it."</p><p>"Neither can I," she flopped onto her back. "That's the  problem."</p><p>Ranma studied the girls  across from him. Ranma-chan had slipped upstairs to Akane's room while he was  out in the dojo talking to Ranko, and from the looks of her now, had been  crying. It was unreal. When she had come downstairs, after Kasumi knocked on  Akane's door to remind her sister to hurry if she wanted to bathe before  breakfast, the cursed teen had made no effort to disguise the evidence of her  unmanly indulgence. Ranko had entered ahead of Ryouga, before Ranma could  comment, and had gone instantly to her side. They had spoken in hushed voices  in the hall for a bit before returning to the table, where Ryouga distracted  Ranma from the questions, or insults, he had been considering. Perhaps that was  a good thing, Ranma considered, but it was beginning to bother him how they  were distancing themselves from him. Oh, it was not hard to figure out why they  were withdrawing, but it disturbed him to see "himself" retreating into the  female guise he had hated as often as not.</p><p>Ranma and Ryouga had changed the topic of their  discussion once they noticed the violent spasm from Ranma-chan, at hearing  mention of the upcoming date with Ranko. They had observed the quick exchange  between Ranma-chan and Ranko, as the cursed girl probed the other girl's  feelings about the matter, and the decision underlying it. After an awkward  hug, and words of mutual support, the two had retreated into silent  contemplation of the what this decision might lead them to become. Ranma could  practically taste the bitter thoughts stewing in both of them. It was too  painful to watch this happening to, well, himself, but neither could he turn  away. It was his fault they were forced to face these challenges. His fault  they confronted a future as girls.</p><p>Genma joined Soun at the table, and Nabiki sauntered in  as Akane raced out of the bathroom. Kasumi began setting out the breakfast  dishes, and frowned at the subdued faces circling the table. Hoping to break  the silence, she smiled and addressed a cheerful question in the direction of  the twin girls, "So, Ranko-chan, is it true you are going on a date with  Ryouga-kun?"</p><p>Ranma-chan stiffened but contained her reaction better  this time. Ranko blushed and flicked a look at Ryouga before meeting Kasumi's  smile. "Ah, yeah. Mom's been buggin' me to try dating. If I'm really gonna be  Ranko—a girl she would want as her daughter—it's about time I started tryin'  her suggestions."</p><p>"Well," Kasumi's smile grew a bit warmer, "I would be  happy to help you get ready this afternoon. Just remember to excuse yourself  from your studies a couple of hours ahead of the date, since this will be  rather new to you!" Ranko's eyes widened at the suggestion. It had not occurred  to her that a date implied getting dressed up for the occasion.</p><p>"Oh, that's okay, Kasumi," Ryouga tried to intervene,  catching the alarm on Ranko's face. "She doesn't need to get dressed up for me!  I think she's pretty enough just the way she is. Really!"</p><p>"Now, don't be silly, Ryouga," Kasumi giggled, waving him  off. "A first date should be really special. You should both try and look your  best and find something really special to do together."</p><p>Genma had been looking back and forth, following the  conversation. He had settled on Ranko with a stern and thoughtful expression. "Daughter,"  he intoned, trying the word out carefully and waiting to see how she reacted to  it. When she simply sucked in her breath and snapped around to stare at him in  shock, he continued, "I am well aware that you have teased Ryouga quite a bit  in the past. I can hardly fault a young man for taking an interest in, ah, a  girl with such healthy attributes." Genma actually blushed, rushing on, "Ahem.  However, in light of what has passed between you, I am hesitant to give my  blessings to this venture."</p><p>"Geez, Pop," she scowled and looked down. "It's just a  date. And it's not like I tried to trick him into it."</p><p>Genma considered that and turned instead to Ryouga, "So,  it was your idea to date her?"</p><p>"Well, not exactly," Ryouga blushed and looked at his  breakfast. "It was my decision to ask her, but it was actually suggested by,  um, someone else. I did talk to Ranma about it first, since I wasn't sure she  would be interested."</p><p>Genma ignored the other details at the moment to sustain  the focus of his pursuit, "Who, if I may ask, actually suggested it?" There was  obvious suspicion written over his face, as he leaned forward to intimidate  Ryouga a little. There was a moment of silence as Ryouga bit his lip.</p><p>"It was my idea, actually," Akane spoke up. She gave  Ryouga a strange look, wondering why they boy had tried to keep it a secret.  Clearing her throat, she explained her reasoning. "Being stuck in a female  body, with Ranma's memories, it seemed to me that it would be kind of hard for  her to really become Ranko, even if Auntie Saotome really wants a daughter. I  thought it might help her to, um, try some things as a girl. I mean, if she can  adjust to being a girl, being Ranko will be a lot easier for her," she outlined  roughly.</p><p>Genma frowned and looked between Ranko and Ranma. "I'm  not sure I understand," he admitted, still looking suspicious.</p><p>Ranma-chan suddenly spoke up, "It's girl training."</p><p>Genma turned to stare at her. She refused to meet his  eyes. "Explain," he commanded, leaning back and picking up his rice bowl.</p><p>Ranma-chan sighed. "There's a lot more to bein' a girl  than just having a girl's body, Pops. If that wasn't true, I'd have really become  a girl every time I changed. Yeah, I've used this form to mess with Ryouga a  lot,"' she admitted, gesturing to herself, "and as a result, Ryouga started to  develop some kind of feelings. When Copy-chan started chasin' him, those  feelings became real. For him and for her. She kinda got absorbed by all of us  when she returned to the mirror. Since she really was a girl, those feelings  are sort of the key to becoming a girl." She looked up and fixed his gaze. "You  suggested it, and she's the one who has to do it. Unless you wanna watch her go  insane, you better let them do it," she warned him.</p><p>"And what do you plan to do?" Genma suddenly challenged.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Are you going to date him too, to see if you can be a  girl, or are you going to remain a boy?"</p><p>"I don't need to date him," she shrugged.</p><p>Genma paused to consider what that implied. He had  absorbed the details related by Cologne, about Ranma-chan's epiphany, about the  struggle the cursed teen faced finding an aspect of identity to cling to for  survival, about the previous incarnation as a woman, and spent the previous  evening pondering them. "Isn't the alternative to being Ranko also being a  girl?" he pressed.</p><p>Ranma-chan twitched.</p><p>"Don't you also need to consider this 'girl training' you  mentioned?"</p><p>"If I become Fa Shen," Ranma-chan declared cautiously, "it'll  be sort of like how they became me. I'll just remember. She doesn't have any  problems with bein' a girl. If anything, the problem will be dealing with  turnin' into a boy."</p><p>Genma's eyes narrowed at that. The idea of his son  suddenly becoming a man hating amazon was a great deal more disturbing than the  notion of him becoming a daughter. Perhaps this previous incarnation was not  the answer to the problem he foresaw. Though he could not honestly support the possibility  of this cure killing the cursed teen, her continued existence remained an  obstacle to reuniting his son and wife. Adopting Ranko would not be a great  difficulty, if the current assumptions were preserved, but one glimpse of the  curse in action would reveal the connection between Ranma and Ranko. He had  hoped that Ranma-chan would be pressured into embracing her femininity and thus  allow him to present her to Nodoka as Ranko's twin sister. It sounded as if  this Fa Shen person might welcome an encounter with the chisuiiton, but it did  not sound like much—if anything—that was Ranma, would survive her emergence.</p><p>Seeing the effect of this topic on those at the table,  Nabiki decided it was time to change the subject. Turning to Akane she smirked,  "Hey, Sis. Since this date thing was all your idea, why don't you grab Ranma  and go along too. Make it a double date!"</p><p>Akane whipped around to stare at her sister in horror,  even as Soun and Genma leapt to their feet shouting their support. In a flash,  they were standing behind Ranma and Akane, pushing them together and babbling  about duty and the necessity of patching up past misunderstandings caused by  the curse. "It will be a perfect chance for you to see the young man you are  going to marry in a new light!" Soun was insisting.</p><p>"This is your chance, Boy! You don't have to worry about  sudden changes ruining the mood! You can finally show Akane how manly you are!"</p><p>"I don't believe this!" Akane whimpered. Glaring at  Nabiki she growled, "I am going to get you for this, Sis!"</p><p>Ranma cringed away from his father and moaned, "Why me!"</p><p>Ranma-chan grabbed him by the front of his shirt and  pulled him forward to respond from an inch away, "You have nothing to complain  about!"</p><p>While everyone at the table was in an uproar, two  diminutive figures entered from outside. Happosai had left the previous evening  to consult with Cologne on how best to deal with the trio's affliction. Seeing  their return to the dojo had gone unnoticed, they absorbed the confusion and  realized what was happening. Akane had unwittingly complicated the situation by  arranging a date between Ryouga and Ranko. The impetuous girl had never  considered this would leave her open to pressure from the fathers to make it a  double date.</p><p>The two elders caught the attention of Ranma-chan, who  slipped outside to hear what they had to say. The good news was that the two  had come up with some ideas to help the trio. In fact, they pointed out, the  prospect of the reflections departing in the afternoon on this latest lark  could actually serve to test the techniques they intended to have the trio  learn during the day. After discussing it, Ranma-chan led the way back inside  and interrupted.</p><p>"Hey!" she shouted to get everyone's attention. When they  all stopped jabbering and looked at her, she continued, "Ranma, Akane, it would  actually be a good idea if you two did go out tonight when Ranko and Ryouga do.  Happosai and Cologne are gonna teach us something today we have to split up to  test. I dunno if a double date is the best idea, so you might wanna plan on  going to different places for this." She quickly outlined the Elders'  suggestions. While she spoke, Cologne's attention gravitated to the other  red-head.</p><p>Ranko was stealing glances at Ryouga, her face clouded by  uncertain thoughts and emotions. It was the look of a girl wondering what she  was getting herself into, cautious of her heart. It brought a strange smile to  the old woman's lips. She could not help but remember her observations about  Copy-chan and the eternally lost boy. Apparently something might come of that  after all. She slipped up to Ryouga and asked a few questions, and received an  explanation detailing Akane's logic on how he could best help Ranko. Cologne  took an optimistic view of the arrangement.</p><p>Cologne's secret interest in Ranma, now that she had  established that the boy was a reincarnation of Fa Shen, forced her to create a  situation that would allow her to continue probing. As an elder, she was  compelled to exploit the situation to resurrect the ancient amazon heroine and  take her back to china. While Ranma-chan was most liable, in her eyes, to adopt  that identity, Ranko seemed a more likely choice for Fa Shen to make. If, as it  seemed possible, Ranko won the heart of Ryouga, he would make an acceptable  husband—with sufficient training to defeat the girl under the right  circumstances. By taking the girl, Ranma-chan would have the option of becoming  Nodoka's daughter Ranko. If she could not embrace that role, she might prefer  to accompany the girl to China as Shampoo's husband, finally. Presenting her  with the second option might be the only way to encourage her to consider the  first.</p>
