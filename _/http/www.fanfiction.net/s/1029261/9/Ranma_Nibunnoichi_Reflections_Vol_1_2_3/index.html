</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Nine: The Double Date of Doom</p><p>The shopping district of  downtown Nerima had a pleasant, outdoor mall kind of feel. Bordering one end of  the largest park, a number of establishments could offer a pleasant view out  their windows, or from the small tables placed on the sidewalk. The Kuno  siblings had taken advantage of this to enhance the mood on their dates.  Copy-chan sat across from Tatewaki at one table, and glanced occasionally over  his shoulder, and that of his sister sitting with her back to them at the next  table, to look at Copy-kun. His look of frustration was a mirror of her own.  She sighed. The double date had started harmlessly enough. The respective  couples had walked through the park, bought treats from street vendors, and now  shared desserts at the ice cream parlor, while Copy-chan and Copy-kun tried to  participate in the Kuno dominated conversations.</p><p>"Kuno…" she tried once again to interrupt his tirade.</p><p>"…there I stood, sword in hand as they came at me. One  after another!" he prattled on, describing some epic battle that seemed to  unfold in a realm far removed from reality.</p><p>"Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!" Kodachi's voice briefly drowned him  out, while both copies cringed in pain at her laugh. "The silly girls cowered  before me, none daring to rise up. I say to you, how utterly plebian! To dare  presume to meet me in equal combat in the gymnasium! But there was no danger  now, I had shown them the error of such presumption!"</p><p>"But… aren't students supposed to compete in school  competitions?" Copy-kun managed to insert, while she was taking a breath.</p><p>"…I struck a mighty blow! The knave cowered as his bokan  shattered before my astonishing skill!" Tatewaki's voice rose in volume,  drowning out his sister's response to Copy-kun. "Yea, with the defeat of their  champion, they hung their heads in shame and groveled before my majesty!"</p><p>Copy-chan rolled her eyes. Her patience was running out.  Standing, she made to excuse herself, but Kuno was out of his seat, his arms  crushing her to his body. The air whooshed out of her lungs, and she could not  draw a breath while in his grip. Straining to look up, as her vision began to  waver, she noticed the look of intense passion on his face. <i>Does he think I  was jumping into his arms in awe of his "masterful victory"? </i>she gasped.  His hands were crawling over her as she struggled weakly in his arms. As his fingers  clenched on her ass, she somehow found the strength to break his hold and step  back.</p><p>"Watch the hands, jerk!" she bellowed, sucking in a  decent breath.</p><p>"Ah, my fiery goddess, you are so shy!" He lunged forward  again.</p><p>Copy-chan tried to jump back, but moved with such shock  she could have cleared a rooftop. If, that is, Kuno had not succeeded in  wrapping his arms around her waist, planting the kiss intended for her lips  right in her bosom. "Kyaaaaaa!" she wiggled and pounded on his head, trying to  make him stop. Beside her, she heard the distinct sound of bodies hitting the  pavement as Kodachi tackled Copy-kun on his way to help her.</p><p>"Oofff!"</p><p>"Ranma! Darling!"</p><p>"Stopitstopitstopit!" Copy-chan grabbed Tatewaki's hair  and pulled, trying to separate his face from her body.</p><p>"Mo, my memmumiph mommeph!" Kuno mumbled through her  shirt.</p><p>Copy-chan was about to rip the boy's ears off. Her mind  spun, trying to figure out what was going wrong with this whole date. Love  struck and fickle, the clones initially responded to the fawning from their  dates. It was clumsy, and invasive, but it sort of did follow the pattern of  flirting. At the same time, there was nothing comforting about these physical  overtures. They kept triggering fighting instincts, identifying the amorous  lunging and grabbing as clear submission tactics. There was nothing seductive  about it. Hell, when Ryouga had outright pinned her to the street, she had felt  more responsive than she did to this!</p><p>"Kuno! Let me go!"</p><p>"As you wish, fair maiden," he looked up and grinned.  "You have but to give me a kiss and I shall release you."</p><p>She looked down into his eyes and shuddered. The  stipulated purpose of this date was to allow the siblings to woo them, to  overcome Copy-chan and Copy-kun's affection for each other. She had come into  this primed to be romanced, and maybe a little seduced. However, the constant  clinging, the possessive and lewd pawing, like this, panicked her. "This isn't  fun, Kuno!"</p><p>"Oh, don't be silly. Just one little kiss," he urged.</p><p>"Will you let go! He's startin' to scare her!" Copy-kun  was shouting into Kodachi's face. Sparing a glance in his direction, Copy-chan  found herself wondering how anything human could be doing such an impressive  octopus impersonation. Was Kodachi a gymnast or a contortionist!</p><p>"Oh, Ranma-sama, fear not for my brother's Love," she  importuned, straining to paint his face with little kisses. "She is in quite  capable hands. As are you!" Her hands wandered, groping and pinching.</p><p>"Capable of what! Ite! That hurts you know!"</p><p>Copy-chan snapped her attention back to Kuno as he began  nuzzling her belly. Her struggles had allowed her to worm her way up a few  inches at a time, but if she continued… and he continued THAT… she did not dare  struggle much more. As his face burrowed into her midsection, he found an  opening in her shirt. Copy-chan stiffened, her aura exploding out of her, as  his tongue darted into her belly button. Her feet instantly found purchase in  his gut, as her arms descended in righteous anger. She managed to push away far  enough from him that the mallet appearing in her hands came down perfectly on  the top of his skull. "Kuno no HENTAI!" she screamed.</p><p>"Co-chan!" Copy-kun bounced straight up, somehow shedding  his Kodachi coating like a film of water, as he reached out to Copy-chan. There  was no thought. The outrage, the fear, in her voice hit the "serve and protect"  button in his brain. He did not mean to abandon Kodachi; though somewhere deep  inside he was glad of an excuse. He had simply scooped Copy-chan into his arms  and taken flight before he could remember that they were supposed to be with  the Kunos.</p><p>"Ranma-sama! Where are you going! Fight her evil  influence! Do it for me!" Kodachi was racing after them, a storm of black  rose-petals swirling away from her as she bounded along.</p><p>Copy-chan just held onto her counterpart and shuddered.  "Don't listen, just keep going!" she breathed. She hated herself for it. It  felt like running from battle. But, the overzealous and obsessive behaviors  Tatewaki and Kodachi were prey to were just too alarming. Dating them could not  be right if they were beginning to feel threatened by their paramours.</p><p>"Saotome! Return at once and unhand my voluptuous vixen!"  Kuno was charging along below them, drawing his bokan. "Remember your vows to  let us date you!"</p><p>"Vows!" the pair snapped around to glare at him. "Nobody  vowed anything! Stop puttin' words in our mouths!"</p><p>"Among other things!" Copy-chan pointed accusingly. That  was another thing that was bothering her. Kuno and his sister had bought them  lots of wonderful treats, and then proceeded to try feeding them bites. That  had been cute once, but the psychotic siblings had started to get "playful". A  few items had tasted too weird for her to trust the next thing he tried to poke  in her mouth.</p><p>"A gentlemen's agreement is as solemn as any vow," Kuno  declared.</p><p>"You call yourself a gentleman!" the copies shouted  back.</p><p>"Why are you interfering, Saotome! I have posed neither  threat nor action against you, yet again you obey the foul compulsion! Do you  lack the will to command your own mind!" the kendoist challenged. That was  enough to make Copy-kun whip around and drop to the ground in front of Kuno.</p><p>"That's low, Kuno," he growled.</p><p>Copy-chan blinked in surprise as her opposite shoved her  into Kuno's arms. "What do you think you're doing?"</p><p>"We made an agreement with them. I can't fight with him.  I have to stay out of the way," he explained, bowing his head in mournful rage.  Then, looking up at Kuno with a deadly expression, he added, "Be careful, Kuno.  If you hurt her, if you even upset her, I will put an end to this."</p><p>Kodachi, having rushed over to claim Copy-kun, gazed at  this pronouncement and blinked in astonishment. It was such a manly, noble  declaration, but it was made in her rival's defense. Her mind did not know what  to think. She blanked out until Copy-chan's finger prodded her in the sternum.</p><p>"That goes for you too, Kodachi," she warned.</p><p>The  couples returned to the ice cream parlor, where the copies focused on devouring  their melted treats under clouds of frustration. The Kuno's remained a bit  cowed for the next fifteen minutes, and then proceeded to work themselves up to  obsessive levels again. Even as their warnings went largely unheeded, the  copies strained to endure the remainder of the afternoon. Their dates had  quickly devolved into a cycle of fight or flight efforts by each clone to  escape molestation. But just enough to get breathing room and the nerve to  continue. More than once, the clones were forced to cross the line to defend  each other's honor, until once more they were back to back fighting each  other's suitor.</p><p>Ranma was in a good mood.  Akane was in a good mood, because Ranma had been too happy to trouble with  insults, and feeling generous, was paying a lot of attention to Akane. After  the initial splurge on ice cream, Ranma had doused himself with hot water and  dragged Akane to see a movie they had both wanted to see. They had left the ice  cream parlor well ahead of the arrival of the double date, so they were still  blissfully unaware of what was going on. On the walk home, Akane mused that  their afternoon had been a date in all but name. Fortunately. Putting a word or  a purpose on it would ruin it. Perhaps Ranma sensed that too. He simply took  her hand and walked beside her on the sidewalk. Faint smiles touched their  lips. Everything remained peaceful, until they got home and Ranma confronted  Nabiki.</p><p>"Good news, Ranma-kun!" the middle Tendo daughter  announced, standing in the genkan ready to pounce on them. "Your Kuno problems  have been solved!"</p><p>Ranma casually let go of Akane's hand, to scratch his  head. "I gotta say it, Nabiki. I am impressed. I don't know how you got those  two to see the truth," he chuckled, shaking his head.</p><p>"Is that what's been going on? You finally got them to  listen?" Akane perked up. She had been wondering what had made her fiancé so  blasted cheerful. She could not believe he hadn't told her. Stupid jerk! After  a narrow eyed look at Ranma, she turned to her sister. "So, what did you have  to do to get them to understand?"</p><p>Nabiki laughed, "Oh, you both give me too much credit. If  anything they're more clueless than before. However," she held up a finger, "I  found a way to use their insanity to help mitigate some of the insanity around  here."</p><p>"What? But they asked me about the curse and everything!  It seemed like they finally got it," Ranma was beginning to lose his sunny  disposition. He looked up and begged the heavens that this was not going to  become complicated.</p><p>"Well," Nabiki mused, "I'm afraid it's a little more  complicated." She paused as Ranma dove onto his face. "Maybe we should sit down  to discuss this, ne?" She turned and let them in to the living room. When they  all sat down, and Kasumi had produced tea and snacks, Nabiki proceeded to  explain. "As we all know, there is no limit to the density of the Kuno family  psyche. Rather than try to penetrate it with the truth, I told them what they  wanted to hear."</p><p>At the moment, Ukyo stormed into the room, "Hey,  everyone! You're not going to believe this!"</p><p>Everyone looked up and asked what she was so excited  about.</p><p>"The Kuno's are on a double date with your copies,  Ran-chan!"</p><p>Ranma and Akane both looked thunderstruck.</p><p>"No way! How the hell did that happen!"</p><p>"The horror," Akane gasped.</p><p>Nabiki cleared her throat. "Take a seat, Ukyo-chan, I was  just about to explain this to them," she glared at the okonomiyaki chef for  spoiling the punch line. "As I was saying, I decided to kill four birds with  one stone. The Kunos have always been a problem, especially for Ranma, and the  copies of Ranma are potentially worse. Fortunately, these two problems cancel  each other out perfectly."</p><p>Ranma studied her, remembering the lunchtime meeting.  "You set this whole thing up. You probably even told them how to take advantage  of the copies' obsession. You arranged this double date," he put it all  together, aloud, unable to decide if it was genius or insanity.</p><p>"That's about right, Ranma-kun. Like I said, you're  starting to show some real promise," she praised with understated sarcasm. She  caught the looks from the other girls at the table. Ukyo and Akane were a  little disturbed that Nabiki had set up his clones with the Kunos. It seemed too  cruel to do to anyone, even them, and they commented on it aloud.</p><p>"Geez, Oneechan," Akane crossed her arms and frowned.  "Those two are like amnesia victims. They have no idea what they're getting  into, and worse, they're modeled on a complete pervert!"</p><p>"Hey! I'm not like that!"</p><p>"That's a nasty thing to do, even to people you don't  want to have around," Ukyo accused, allowing her words to drown out Ranma's  protest. Before a fight could break out, she turned to Ranma and asked, "Is  this alright with you? I mean, it's not likely to go anywhere, but now the  Kunos will have a whole new level of absurdity to cling to. They'll never  believe the truth now," she observed. Ranma stared at her. All the happiness  from the afternoon had drained out of him, and sweat was beading on his  forehead.</p><p>"Honestly, I think the copies are too conditioned to  pound on those two to be able to seriously date them. The point is that as long  as the Kunos are chasing them, you are in the clear, Ranma," Nabiki cut in  before Ranma could answer Ukyo.</p><p>"But," Ranma was worrying now, "The only reason they  never hooked up with anyone but each other was because they scared most people  off. No way that's gonna happen with the Kunos. You could not chase them off  with a pack of rabid wild c-c-cats!"</p><p>"You have a point there," Nabiki admitted, as she began  to think it over again. For crying out loud, both copies had put the moves on  Ranma, and there were few things more dangerous to truly mess with.</p><p>Ukyo shrugged and turned back to Ranma, "I don't see the  problem, really. If the dates lead nowhere, very little has changed. If they do  get serious, then that takes care of both problems, right? Unless…" she bit her  lip. "Ran-chan? Do those two HAVE to go back in the mirror? Will something bad happen  if they stay out?"</p><p>"No way! They go back at the end of the week! That's  final!"</p><p>"Hmmm," Nabiki tilted her head and commented absently,  "That definitely makes things complicated. Whatever sort of relationship the  Kunos thing they're getting into, they'll automatically converge on Ranma as  soon as the copies are gone." She snapped her mouth shut, as she realized she  was thinking aloud.</p><p>The comment hit Ranma like an atom bomb, "I gotta stop  them! Now!" He jumped up and ran out of the house. He had to break up the dates  at once. The rest followed, expecting things to swiftly balloon into  pandemonium.</p><p>"Ranma! Wait!"</p><p>"I'm with you, Ran-chan!"</p><p>"I'll, uh, be along shortly," Nabiki saw the martial  artists flying out of sight and dropped into a walk. Imagine her, running! She  shook her head.</p><p>As Ranma raced desperately  across Nerima, pursued by his official fiancées, he had no idea that the double  date was coming to a furious conclusion. Two figures, trembling with shattered  nerves and angry disgust were cutting through the park with every intention of  returning to the Tendo Dojo. Trailing them with threats and entreaties were  their respective dates. The copies tried to ignore Tatewaki and Kodachi, while  smoothing down their disheveled hair and straightening their clothing. Their  wild eyes and sweat sheened faces revealed that the glut of aphrodisiacs,  slipped to them by the Kunos, were beginning to be metabolized, adding to the  emotional turmoil each suffered. They did not know what to do with themselves,  but getting away from the psychotic siblings definitely seemed like a good  start.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tatewaki and Kodachi would not back off.</p><p>"Leggo, dammit! I said the date is over! I have to go!"</p><p>"Pig-tailed-girl! I implore you! The evening is still young!"</p><p>"Oh, Ranma-sama! Let us recline together under the shade  of that tree!"</p><p>"No, Kodachi! I said it was time to go home!"</p><p>In their initial efforts to slip away, they had made  promises to allow their suitors to take them on a later date, if they would  just go away for now. That was imperative. Once their bodies had begun to  respond to the molestation, they had known it was time to split. Things were  going way too fast, spinning out of control, and that upset them to the core.</p><p>"Stop it, Kuno! There won't be a second date if you don't  back off!"</p><p>"Ko-Kodachi! Let go of… get your hands outta there!"</p><p>Copy-chan bashed Kuno down for the hundredth time and  turned to look at her counterpart. Poor Copy-kun was fairing poorly against  Kodachi, unwilling to actually hit her or hurt her to make her back off. Seeing  that the girl had tripped him and was slipping her hand into the waistband of  his pants, while Copy-kun slithered back in desperation, she had to come to his  aid once more. Grabbing the girl by her side-slung ponytail, she jerked her off  of Copy-kun and threw her towards the nearest tree. As Kodachi flipped in the  air and readied herself to spring back, Kuno recovered and lunged for  Copy-chan.</p><p>Copy-kun, seeing she had her back to him, focusing on Kodachi,  flew across to catch Kuno on the chin with a solid kick. He was happy to square  off against the kendoist, since this was a threat he could easily defend  himself against, where as his sister's assaults made a mockery of his defenses.  If he had known how impulsive and treacherous the nature of the Kuno siblings  was, neither he nor Copy-chan would have agreed to their proposals.</p><p>"It is to laugh," Kuno remarked, rubbing his jaw and  composing himself regally as Copy-kun squared off against him once more. "I,  the great Tatewaki Kuno, forced to choose between love and honor, must bow and  accept such blows. Though it is meet I should teach you the lesson you well  deserve, I repeat, I will not fight with you, Saotome."</p><p>"Too bad. If anyone needs a lesson here, it's you,  moron!"</p><p>"Pig-tailed-girl! Again you try to come between me and my  love!" Kodachi was raving, fanning a set of gymnastic clubs in one hand and  twirling a ribbon in the other. "Clearly, it is not possible for Ranma-sama to  court me while you remain present. To that end, I deliver you into the care of  my brother, using whatever means necessary to discourage your misplaced  affection for my beloved!"</p><p>"Dream on, Kodachi! I've seen what you're like now. I  can't let him date a psycho like you!" Copy-chan prepared herself for the  girl's attack.</p><p>"My dear sister! It is time we joined forces to separate  these two, that we might persevere in our efforts to woo them!"</p><p>"Don't think you're getting through me, Kuno! There's no  way I'll let her go out with a freak like you!" Copy-kun shouted, rushing  forward.</p><p>"I am ready, elder brother! For love!" she cried,  signaling the beginning of the siblings' combined attack. As one, the Kunos  moved to flank their rivals, preparing to lash out. The copies moved with equal  precision, stepping in close to penetrate the broad defenses their opponents  enjoyed courtesy of their weapons. They were both surprised by the intensity of  the Kunos' attacks, finding themselves forced to dodge. As Copy-chan darted  away from Kodachi's attack, Copy-kun stumbled into it, retreating from Kuno's  "strike of a thousand blows". Copy-kun found himself snared by Kodachi's  ribbon, as Copy-chan's clothing vanished into a thousand shreds under the  skillful blows of Kuno's bokan.</p><p>"Gyaaaa! *Gulp* *Gag* *Cough cough* What're you tryin' to  do! Choke me to death!" Copy-chan screamed, as Kuno took advantage of her  gasp of surprise, her hands busy trying to keep her clothes from falling off,  to squirt some kind of fluid down her throat.</p><p>Copy-kun, rolling on the ground after being tripped by  the constricting ribbon, tried to see what the kendoist had done to his  counterpart, when Kodachi lobbed a small globe at his face. It popped on  impact, dousing him in a cloud of sickeningly sweet vapor. "D… dammit, Koda…  *Snork, snore*" he was unconscious before he could finish griping.</p><p>Copy-chan whipped around to see what had happened to him,  but the world kept spinning even after she stopped. She was still struggling to  recover her balance when Kuno grabbed her and threw her over his shoulder.  "Have no fear, my goddess! The Secret Sake of Love will surely overpower the  curse you suffer! You shall be drunk with love for me!"'</p><p>"Excellent work, brother dear! Now we must hasten to put  as much distance between these two as possible, to counter the effects of that  accursed attraction!" Kodachi produced a make-shift litter and rolled  Copy-kun's unconscious body onto it. Kuno nodded, pausing to place his hand on  his sister's shoulder.</p><p>"Truly, extraordinary measures are mandated lest we fail  to preserve our most beloved treasures from the danger of each other. Go now,  Kodachi, to victory!" he bowed his head to her, then began to prance the  opposite way through the park. In the bushes, just out of sight, Akane and Ukyo  climbed off of Ranma. The three of them had arrived in time to see the  mismatched couples quarrel and fight, and the fiancées had dog piled on Ranma  to keep him from jumping into the middle of things and making them worse. While  holding him down, they had gotten an eyeful as the Kuno's swiftly incapacitated  Ranma's twins and began carting them off.</p><p>"I suppose we should have expected this," Akane quipped.</p><p>"What didja go and do that for!" Ranma complained as he  picked himself up and dusted himself off.</p><p>"Ranchan, do you think it would be a good idea to let the  Kunos see you and your copies all at the same time? I mean, think about it,"  Ukyo tried to point out reasonably.</p><p>"Later," Akane huffed, "Right now we should split up and  go rescue those clowns. Come on, Ukyo." Akane grabbed the chef by the arm and  dragged her off after Kodachi. Ranma fumed for a moment, then turned to sprint  after Kuno. As soon as the three of them were out of sight, another form pushed  through the bushes, from the opposite side of the clearing.</p><p>"Where in the world am I now!" Ryouga cried out to the  sky. Lowering his eyes, he noticed the signs of recent combat. Picking up a few  of Kodachi's clubs his face became excited. "This is one of Kodachi's clubs! I  am sure of it! Does… does that mean I am back in Nerima!" He began laughing,  tears streaming down his cheeks. "Oh, Akari! Again my heart leads the way to  you!" he could not believe his luck. Just that morning, he had resolved to call  Akari and arrange for a date to make up for the one he had run out on after  being kissed by Ranma's copy. Believing it had been Ranma, he had been too  ashamed to face Akari. But, she seemed eager to meet with him again, suggesting  the park after school. Now all he had to do was figure out where in the park  their meeting place was!</p><p>By pure chance, or maybe the true curse of his warped sense  of direction was to always pick the worst possible destination and reach it in great  haste, he rushed off in the same direction as Ranma and Kuno.</p><p>Akane and Ukyo hightailed it after Kodachi, impressed  that she could move so quickly while dragging so much dead weight. Kodachi  heard the rush of feet behind her and whipped around, forgetting for the moment  the boy on the improvised litter. The gymnast unintentionally dumped him in a  shallow trench beside the path she had been following, dodging Ukyo and Akane's  initial assault. "Oh-hohohohohohoho! Do you think to catch me by surprise!" she  cried, reaching into nowhere to produce part of her arsenal.</p><p>"Does it look like we're going for surprise here!" Ukyo  cried, flinging a handful of mini-spatulas to shred ribbon and knock clubs from  the gymnast's hands. In her other hand, she readied her primary weapon, the  giant spatula.</p><p>"Don't waste your breath, Ukyo," Akane growled. "There's  no point talking to her." Cracking her knuckles, Akane grinned in anticipation  of finally getting the chance to pay Kodachi back for the insults and ambushes  of their first conflict. In seconds, the official fiancées had closed in on the  self-appointed rival and begun their deadly dance. On the surface it seemed a  typical fight of the rival fiancée's over Ranma, except the clone did not  inspire any conflict between Akane and Ukyo. This allowed them to work  effectively together against Kodachi and her treacherous attacks.</p><p>Within moments, the allies had Kodachi on the ropes.</p><p>In the opposite direction, Ranma had unexpectedly caught  up to and confronted Kuno. He had expected the older boy would be able to make a  swift getaway, hardly burdened by Copy-chan's light form. He was not prepared  to stumble across the couple near the edge of the park. Seeing the kendoist  bent over the girl's unconscious form, his hands around her neck, Ranma's heart  lurched in a panic. He certainly could not know that Kuno had paused to choke another  combination of aphrodisiacs and the rest of a love potion down the girl's  throat. Though he could not imagine why the older boy might try to kill his "goddess"  Ranma really could not put such a thing past him. Kuno, for his part, might not  have actually intended to choke the girl to death, but it had not occurred to  him to wonder how she could swallow while unconscious.</p><p>"Kuno!" Ranma roared, "If you've hurt her, I'll make you  wish you were never born!" Ranma kicked Kuno off, and dropped to check on the  girl. Before he could so much as verify that she was breathing, Kuno had  rebounded and rushed forward to attack.</p><p>"Saotome! I do not know how you escaped my sister's  clutches, but I assure you, you shall not this time escape my wrath!" he lunged  with his sword, prepared to thrust it right through the martial artist's chest.  His promise not to fight with his rival could not survive the perceived failure  of his sister. If she could not keep Ranma out of his way, than it was up to  Kuno to remove, once and for all, the threat to his dreams of bliss.</p><p>Ranma was forced to retreat rapidly in the face of Kuno's  onslaught. He was well aware that Kuno could wield that wooden sword with  lethal effectiveness. He also knew that deep in the kendoist's psyche was the  memory of his watermelon training. That unbeatable technique was showing itself  as Kuno lost himself to rage and a willingness to kill. Sparing one last look  at the girl laying helpless in the dirt, Ranma scowled and took flight. He had  to lose Kuno quickly if he was going to be able to help her.</p><p>The two quickly vanished into combat.</p><p>Copy-chan lay there, her throat trying to work around the  objects lodged in her throat and draw breath, her mind spinning in an alcohol  induced nightmare, while birds flitted from tree emitting cheerful twerps and  whistles. A few, painfully long moments passed before Ryouga stumbled through  the bushes. If this was fortune smiling on her, it was a warped and wicked  smile, because the lost boy was blindly absorbed in fantasies of being reunited  with Akari. At least, until he tripped over the girl convulsing in the dirt. Picking  himself up, his temper boiling to the surface, he turned to see what offending  and soon to be mauled obstruction had dared to spill him onto his face. As his  eyes came into focus, and the only appropriate words he could manage to phrase  his ire formed in his head, Copy-chan ran out of time. As Ryouga tripped over  her, she had reflexively gasped, sucking the obstructions deeper into her  throat, sealing off her airway. Her body arched one last time, as the strain on  her system from lack of oxygen, too much alcohol, drugs and potions combined to  stop her heart.</p><p>"Damn you Ranma! Prepare to die!" Ryouga's eternal  challenge finally erupted. Ryouga lurched to his feet, umbrella out, ready to  follow his challenge with violence. A couple of seconds ticked by. Ryouga's  face flushed a dark red. "Hey! Get up, you lazy bastard! It's time for you to  pay for all the insults and all the crimes you have committed against me!" The  tension holding the girl's body in its final arch of protest suddenly melted  away, leaving her limp. "What kind of an idiot do you take me for!" Ryouga  shouted. "Stop playing dead and face me!"</p><p>Copy-chan did not move.</p><p>Ryouga stared in annoyance. Finally, he moved forward and  poked the girl with his umbrella. Nothing. He crouched by her ear and let out a  head splitting scream. Still nothing. "Geez, Ranma! What does it take to wake  you up!" He reached out to pinch the back of the girl's hand. Still no  reaction. And that was not all, his mind insisted. She was too still. <i>She  isn't breathing,</i> a voice murmured in his head. With fingers that suddenly  would not stop trembling, he pressed on her wrist, seeking a pulse. He put his  ear to her chest, after failing to find a pulse. Finally, a full minute after  she stopped moving, he sat back on his heels and gasped, "I don't believe it!  Ranma's dead!" Ryouga swallowed hard. He had not done anything. He was sure of  it. He had just tripped over her. "Ranma's dead… and… it's not my fault!"</p><p>Ryouga bounced up and began to dance around the clearing.  At long last! His most hated rival was out of the way! Nothing stood between  him and Akane!</p><p>Just then Kuno and Ranma rushed through the clearing.  Ryouga blinked, as the combatants raced away, splashing through a fountain.  Though it was some distance away, Ryouga could not miss the shift from black to  red hair, as Ranma changed. His eyes dropped to the girl before him. His mind  flashed back to a week earlier, his first kiss, then skipped to that morning.</p><p><i>            "Or, did you actually like that kiss?"</i></p><p>"Copy-chan," he breathed.</p>
