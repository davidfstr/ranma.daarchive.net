</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Twenty-Two: Variations on a Girl and Her Curse</p><p>Even though it was a  Wednesday night, and thus deep in the middle of the work week, Ranko was not  the only well dressed young lady hanging on a man's arm waiting for the train. While  Ryouga and herself were much younger than the majority of those crowding the  platform, they were not the youngest. This fact drew a few unpleasant looks and  muttered comments from Nodoka, who clammed up and smiled if either of her  charges glanced over at her. It was kind of unnerving, since she was far enough  away to give them the illusion of privacy, but far too close for Ranko to feel  comfortable speaking openly to Ryouga. She sighed and looked down. She had  intended to lay down a few rules with Ryouga, and draw him out on the subject  of past… misunderstandings, but it all had too much to do with Ranma. If his  name so much as tickled their lips, the woman would perk up and lean in  hungrily to catch any tidbit she could about her son. Ranko glanced at the boy  beside her, reading the discomfort on his face as he struggled against the urge  to pace. The problem being that part about turning at each end. He would be  mortified if he took a wrong turn at one extreme and ended up lost right at the  start of his date.</p><p>He glanced back at Nodoka, who grinned and waved at him.</p><p>"I appreciate her helping out with reservations and  such," he commented aside to Ranko. "I just wish she wasn't watching our every  move."</p><p>"I hear ya, Man," she glanced over and then back. "Look  out," she barked, shoving him roughly around to her left. A spray of water  flashed through his after image, followed by the bottle that had been kicked  into the air by some leather clad punk. She glared in his direction, catching  his eye easily, while Ryouga panted in shock and irritation.</p><p>"Dammit! That's the fifth time!"</p><p>"Sheesh. Last thing I want is for Mom to see a curse in  action!"</p><p>"You'd think under a covered train platform, where no  food or drinks are allowed, I'd be safe!" he grumbled, as Ranko kept him from  going over to "speak" with the jerk who had almost doused him.</p><p>"Don't. He's just a stupid punk."</p><p>"Yeah, but I don't like the way he's lookin' at you."</p><p>Ranko stared at him, then glared. Before she could yell  at him, she choked herself off and turned to stare down at the tracks. Getting  mad at him for treating her like a girl was extremely stupid. Especially  considering how worried she had been that he would not be able to see past her  history as Ranma. She tightened her fist and controlled her breathing. She was  about to do the impossible—or turn around and thank him—when she noticed  something in the crowd. It was hard to catch all of it, but she distinctly saw  a water bottle wrapped in a wad of yen being passed between two people, who had  their heads together in the shadows. They were concealed for a moment as the  tide of bodies between her and them shifted, but a moment later, the crowd  parted and she could clearly make out the form of Nabiki Tendo. Catching  Ranko's eye, she grinned, pulled another water bottle out of her backpack,  opened it impudently and took a long swallow.</p><p>"I don't believe it!"</p><p>"What?" Ryouga focused in on Ranko's face as the anger in  her voice registered. He noticed her staring off into the crowd and followed  her gaze. He quickly spotted Nabiki. "Nabiki? What's she doing here?"</p><p>"It looks like she's paying people to splash you with  water, Pork-butt!"</p><p>"Hey!" That sounded like the Ryouga she knew! Oops.</p><p>"Sorry. Habit!" she bowed her head meekly, keeping her  eyes on Nabiki.</p><p>"Break it!" he ordered, glaring.</p><p>Ranko sighed and kicked herself mentally. "Why is she  trying to sabotage our date?" she wondered, leading him back on topic.</p><p>Ryouga shrugged. A moment later he groaned and fixed  Nabiki with a glare that could break stones. Ranko twitched and reminded  herself to never, ever give him an idea like that. It was bad enough when he  did that at close range! She poked him, silently demanding an answer and he  sighed. "Now I know what she meant when she offered to sell me insurance for  our date!"</p><p>"Great!" Ranko snarled. "Just great! What else can go  wrong!"</p><p>"Ranko!" Ryouga glared at her in warning. It was too  late.</p><p>Nabiki suddenly turned and scampered out of sight just in  time to avoid the spill of human bodies upended as Kuno rushed onto the  platform, racing straight at the two of them. By some common instinct, the mob rapidly  cleared that entire section of the platform. Ranko took one look down at what  she was wearing and despaired. There was no way she could fight in this dress.  Not unless she hiked it up around her waist to free her legs. Even as she  grimaced and started to gather the fabric in her hands, her mother suddenly  appeared between her and the charging kendoist. Ranko was momentarily blinded  as the silk wrapping of her family's honor blade fluttered free before her,  then she was jerking Ryouga down to keep him from being beheaded as the naked  blade swung free of its scabbard.</p><p>"Whoops! Mustn't drop it!" Nodoka cried, losing her grip.</p><p>"Oh shit!" Ranko wondered if anywhere was safe.</p><p>"Do not fear, my beloved Pig-Tailed Goddess! I have come  to rescue you from the foul clutches of that cretin, Habiki!" Kuno gushed.</p><p>"Gyaaaa!" Ryouga saw the flash of live steel dance in  front of his nose and cringed as it whipped madly around, by chance or by pure  malice coming within inches of cleaving, slashing or skewering the dozen people  lingering too close in curiosity, who darted away in instant terror. Nodoka  finally got control of the weapon and steadied it in front of her.</p><p>"Oh dear! It seems Nerima just never changes! Smooth down  your dress! I will protect you, Ranko-chan!" Nodoka braced herself before Kuno,  surprised with the speed with which she had been moved by her maternal  instincts. The very notion of allowing Ranko to hike up her dress for battle  had spurred her instantly to action. However good a fighter, a young lady  simply could not be allowed to do battle in her panties!</p><p>"Mo-! A-auntie N-No-Nodoka!" Ranko tried to stop her. To  her shock, Kuno responded instinctively to an opponent wielding a sword and  launched into a devastating series of attacks. Even more surprising, the wild  blade danced in her mother's hands, casually deflecting all of his strikes.</p><p>"At last! A worthy opponent rises against the Blue  Thunder!"</p><p>"Oh Dear! I really must remember to practice with this  thing more often!" Nodoka cried, somewhat embarrassed but not the least upset  by the kendoist's onslaught. Strangely, as the fury of Kuno's attack left her  with no room to think, her swordsmanship suddenly shifted into precise, complex  and devastating form. In the blink of an eye, her defense solidified. Then,  with two quick movements, Kuno's bokan was flying back over the crowd and Kuno  was suddenly grasping at his hakama to keep it from dropping around his ankles.</p><p>"That- that was incredible!" he gasped, eyes crossed upon  the point of the blade hovering at the end of his nose. Ranko and Ryouga stared  at Nodoka in absolute disbelief. Their eyes met in silent consensus. The word  they would have used was "impossible".</p><p>"Oh! I am so sorry!" Nodoka gasped in shock at herself.  "I- I- Forgive me for meeting you with a live blade, but, you see, I simply  could not allow you to attack my daught- Ranko-chan!"</p><p>Ranko snapped her eyes back to her mother. Did she know!</p><p>"Y- you are the mother of the glorious Pig-Tailed-Girl!"  Kuno stared.</p><p>"I- Well, actually…"</p><p>"No. I can see the resemblance. Truly you are a woman of  great nobility, to best a great warrior such as myself with the sword! Alas,"  he frowned and sighed, "there is a misunderstanding. I could never bring myself  to attack one so vibrant, so pure as your daughter!"</p><p>"Except for EVERY FREAKIN' TIME YOU SEE ME!" Ranko  shouted right in his face, flushing with anger.</p><p>Nodoka, oblivious to that, stuttered, "Ah… well…  actually… I don't have a daughter. Oh, how I wish… but no."</p><p>Kuno and Ranko turned to stare at her, confused by her  statements. There was a frightened, hopeful look on Ranko's face. Nodoka paused  to study her, conscious of the fact that she had not intended to reveal her  feelings for the girl. Unfortunately, in the heat of the moment, she had  betrayed herself. Ranko looked at her, eyes moist, clearly afraid of what she might  say. Nodoka stepped forward and put her hand on the girl's shoulder and looked  her in the eye.</p><p>"I wish you were my daughter," she smiled cautiously,  hoping the girl would not reject this overture. She seemed so desperate for a  mother. "I suppose it's time I admitted that to you." Ranko seemed speechless,  but the fear and anxiety seemed to wash out of her. Nodoka sighed and turned to  Kuno. "If, as you claim, you mean this girl no harm, how do you explain this  attack?"</p><p>Kuno straightened himself, and finished retying the waist  of his hakama. "My Lady. I am saddened to learn you are not this girl's mother,  for sooth, I would at once beg for her hand in marriage!"</p><p>"Y- you want to marry Ranko?" Nodoka stammered in  surprise. She turned to stare at the girl, well aware of how modest and  feminine she looked now. Considering how she habitually presented herself,  Nodoka had despaired of her having any suitors, not to mention one so well  spoken and cultured as this! "I was not aware that she was in such a relationship!  Do you claim to be courting her?"</p><p>"Indeed, I would say nothing else! E're now we have dated  several times. Most recently the day before last!"</p><p>"And you have proposed to her?" she covered her mouth in  concern.</p><p>"Nay,  as I have yet to learn of her true parentage, I have instead taken upon myself  the task of protecting her from the unspeakable depredations foisted upon her  by curs like him," he pointed at Ryouga. Turning to face the lost boy, he  accused, "Often have I heard of you seeking to force your attentions upon young  women, most notably the fair Akane Tendo! I will not permit you to defile the  immaculate beauty of my fair goddess!"</p><p>"K- Kuno!" Ranko could hardly speak, she was so irate.</p><p>Ryouga growled and began to stalk towards the kendoist.  "I should kill you for saying such things!" he spat, beginning to glow a  menacing purple. "No one has done more to demean and offend her than you!"</p><p>"Ha! It is to laugh! Truly you are lost if you do not  know that your rival, your most hated foe, did warp and exploit their curse to  bind her to him! Even so far as to force her to assume his name and dress in  his clothes!"</p><p>"WHAT!" Nodoka reared up above the boys, enshrouded in  a column of flames. She stared at Ranko, nailing her with a look that sent a  chill into her heart. "Do you speak of Ranma Saotome!"</p><p>"I could speak of no other, I assure you, Madame!"</p><p>Nodoka heaved several angry breaths, still staring at  Ranko. "What is this curse you speak of!" she demanded.</p><p>Kuno turned and studied her. He bowed his head, "It would  be unseemly to speak of such a thing, especially before the girl herself. Honor  forbids me from speaking on this matter without her leave."</p><p>Nodoka turned her glare on him and he visibly quailed.  "Absolutely. However, as it happens that Ranma Saotome IS my son, and you have  impugned his character with this accusation, I would think it wise that you beg  her leave to speak of it, so you may explain this insult to my family's honor!"</p><p>Poor Kuno could not contain himself. This women, this noble  lady who had bested him with the sword, was the mother to his hated rival?  Having seen the boy's father he had naturally been confidant in Saotome's low  birth, but, here before him stood a vision of grace and beauty and fire even  his beloved Pig-Tailed-Goddess paled beside. He swallowed with great  difficulty, and turned to Ranko. "Pig-Ta…"</p><p>"Her name is Ranko! Do her the courtesy of using it!"</p><p>"Ra-Ranko," he gulped, stammered and pushed on, "I beg  your leave…"</p><p>"You mean to tell her what Nabiki told you for FORTY  MILLION YEN!"</p><p>He swallowed hard again and nodded.</p><p>Ranko smiled at the glare he got from her mother for that  admission. No doubt Nabiki would hear about this too. Summoning up all the ice  she could, which was impressive enough with the Soul of Ice technique at her  disposal, she glared at him. "I didn't wanna mess up Ranma's life by revealing  the nature of the curse afflicting… us. I won't let you spill it just to attack  Ranma. After all, you admitted to his face, he's just a victim, like me, so  he's really innocent of all that crap you always accuse him of, right Kuno?"  Kami, she hoped this went off right. While it was a lie, it was safer than the  truth could ever be, and it would not come from her lips.</p><p>Nabiki, who had edged forward to listen to this  confrontation stared at Ranko with carefully hidden respect. Occasionally,  hints of a brain emerged, but this was quite different. Nabiki decided she must  finally be rubbing off on the girl. She had admired how Ranko maneuvered the  situation, explicitly identifying the rumor Nabiki herself had created and  using it to evade the fatal truth. Better, she forced Kuno to recant his  accusations about Ranma, removing the stain to his honor in her mother's eyes. If  she kept this up, Nabiki would have to start keeping a serious eye on her.</p><p>Kuno turned to Nodoka and cleared his throat. "From the  day I became acquainted with Ranma Saotome and the… and Ranko, I was concerned  about the connection between them. Though he had stolen the affections of the  noble Tendo Akane…" he paused as he remembered that the engagement he so  strenuously opposed had been arranged by their parents. It might not be a good  idea to speak ill of that. "Ahem. Though he was… engaged… to Akane, he seemed  to…" he glanced at Ranko nervously. "He seemed to be, ah, somewhat intimately  involved with, er, Ranko."</p><p>Nodoka turned to look at Ranko, who blushed, remembering  the lewd imagery Kuno had evoked, protesting Nabiki's revelation that she and  Ranma were as one body and soul. She also remembered Nodoka questioning her  about her affection for Ranma. She swallowed nervously.</p><p>Kuno swallowed some air and continued, "I endeavored to  intercede, hoping to free Ranko from Ranma's influence. It was unspeakable for  a girl of her beauty and passion to be bound so utterly to his influence, even  to the point of assuming his name, his manner—even his wardrobe—and fighting in  his battles! Though I ached to know her name, her true identity, she was compelled  to insist that she must answer to HIS name!"</p><p>Nodoka was really staring at Ranko now, who trembled a  little, but could not utter a word. Silently she begged the insufferable  windbag to get to the point and clear up this mess!</p><p>"Why?" Nodoka gasped, grabbing her and forcing Ranko to  meet her gaze. "I can see by your face you do not dispute these claims! Why are  you so intimate with my son!"</p><p>Ranko just could not speak. Even Nabiki bit her lip and  shook her head when the Saotome matriarch glanced at her. Kuno finally came  through, "I asked that every night for months, until at last I learned the  horrible truth. Though I know not the exact cause, and I must beg you believe  as I speak of magics most dark and foul, I tell you it is a curse."</p><p>Nodoka looked puzzled and studied his face. The  conviction there and in his words was disturbing. "Magic? A curse?"</p><p>"Alas, though it would be a far better thing than to  contemplate such a possibility, in this past year I have myself witnessed such  things of legend and lore that I cannot deny the influence of magic, even in  this modern world. Thus, your son and this brave girl did somehow encounter  some dangerous artifact that has bound their fates to each other. It is a  damnable curse, that drives them to seek love, though it denies them any hope  of loving each other. I have learned that were they to be separated from each  other, or dare to embrace each other as lovers, they must perish," Kuno cried,  sagging to the ground.</p><p>Nodoka gasped. "Is this true?"</p><p>Nabiki cleared her throat and stepped forward, "I don't  know how to explain it better, but the facts are certain. The boy we call  Ranma, and the girl we call Ranko are bound together spiritually. If one were  to die tonight, the other would certainly follow. The intimacy they share is  not what you might think, though it is part of their curse to know more and  less of each other than lovers. I suppose you could say, they were so close  that Ranko had to deny her own femininity to protect Ranma's masculinity,"  Nabiki dared with inspired genius. Oh, the three were going to owe her big time  for this!</p><p>Nodoka heard that and whipped around to Ranko. She opened  and closed her mouth in shock a few times before she got out, "Is this truly  the reason for how you dress and act?"</p><p>Ranko actually laughed in honest relief, "Actually,  yeah."</p><p>"You sacrificed your own womanhood to protect my son's  manliness?" Nodoka was flabbergasted. She could not, in her own odd way of  viewing things, think of a more noble sacrifice a girl could make. "And yet,  you do not love my son?" it seemed implausible.</p><p>Ranko sighed, "I suppose you can't understand it just  looking at it. With the curse it's like… like we're the same person. So, yeah,  I guess I do love him, but it's like loving myself. I wouldn't want to be… you  know… with him. It just wouldn't be… right… somehow."</p><p>Nodoka stepped close and fingered the dress Ranko was  wearing, remembering the many times she had nagged Ranko into more feminine  clothing and manners. Strangely, it was at such a time that her son had  appeared acting in the most unmanly fashion. If what she was hearing was true,  then she was actually partly at fault for her son's perversity. After all, if  the curse forced Ranko to dress as her son, might it not also force her son to  dress as Ranko? How horrifying. "But, what does this mean? Should I believe then,  that because I encouraged you to dress like this and date… my son might…!"</p><p>Ranko hastily cut her off, "NO!" She grabbed Nodoka's  hands and looked her in the eye. "No, Mo- Auntie! No. We're working on a cure,  and this is just part of testing it. Right now he is with Akane and I assure  you, he is being very manly!"</p><p>"Did you almost call me 'Mom'?" Nodoka blinked.</p><p>Ranko sighed, "I- I… well, I guess it's safe enough to  tell you now. I don't have a mother besides you. I mean, you know, through  Ranma," she hastily corrected.</p><p>Nodoka stared at her in sudden sadness. "No mother? Oh  you poor child!" she grabbed the girl and hugged her to herself. She had been  right! The girl had needed her all along. Perhaps she was not her true  daughter, but from what she had sacrificed for her son, she had proven herself  worthy of being part of the family. As she hugged the girl, Ranko was doing her  best not to cry as she crossed the threshold between her true identity and the  one she had finally adopted. She almost lost it when her mother softly asked  her, "Would it please you to have a mother? To be my daughter?"</p><p>After a moment, as she got her breathing and trembling  under control, she pulled back and looked at Nodoka. "I- I would like that. I-  I have wanted that since I met you, I guess. But," she turned away and looked  at Ryouga. "I'm not entirely free of the curse yet. Your son and I could both  be lost to you at any time because of it. Maybe… maybe it is best if we wait  until it's broken before we consider something like that."</p><p>Nodoka looked puzzled. Ryouga picked up the silk wrapping  that normally concealed her sword and handed it to her. Without thinking, she  sheathed the weapon and quickly bundled it up. Looking at the girl the entire  time, it was obvious that there was something else bothering her. Something  that had not been said. "Why would it be necessary to wait?"</p><p>Ranko considered things carefully. What they had told her  mother was a lie. There were elements of truth in it, but by deceiving her  things could very easily blow up in everyone's face. Sighing, she turned back,  "This isn't the first time we've thought we'd found a cure. This one comes with  a price we might not be able to pay. Ranma and I, we might survive this cure,  but a part of us could die. The only sure way to prevent that is to allow the  curse to become…"  she cut herself off.  "It would change the curse to something you might not care to know of. If it  came to that, the only other cure I know of would… save your son's life."</p><p>Nodoka paused for a moment to parse that statement. Then  her eyes got wide. "What about you?"</p><p>"I… you can't lose a daughter you don't have," she turned  away. "I'm not saying it has to come to that, but for people like you and  Akane… If it came down to it, you'd need him more than me. That's just the way  it is." There was silence all around her, painful silence shared by Ryouga,  Kuno and Nodoka, and sober quiet from Nabiki. For several long moments, no one  spoke, then Ranko turned and smiled at everyone, "Hey! I think our train's  here! Come on, Ryouga! We need to get a move on, I am absolutely starving!"</p><p>Nabiki looked at the cheerful red-head dragging Ryouga  over to the edge of the platform and turned to look at Kuno. He was staring at  the girl as if he feared she might be just an illusion. "The sad thing, Kuno,  is that she's right. She'd sacrifice everything for Ranma. She doesn't really  have a choice."</p><p>"Wh- why?" he babbled, still too stunned by the  revelation, and what it implied, to pursue her onto the train that was pulling  up. Nodoka had hastened away from the two sophomores to take charge of the  young couple, pushing aside the horrible revelations she had just absorbed,  taking her cue from Ranko and smiling in anticipation of the night's delights.  She had not given the Kendoist a second look. Still, she had not forgotten his  proposal. He seemed to have some concerning issues, but it was not hard to see  the real reason he had insulted her son. How could any boy resist such a  selfless, passionate girl?</p><p>"Come on, Kuno-chan. I better drag you on home."</p><p>In the wake of the battle in  the park, the witnesses and participants quickly retreated back to Dr. Tofu's  clinic. An air of tense confusion subdued them to the exchange of puzzled and  worried glances and a number of aborted attempts to speak to the girl who had  proven herself to be Fa Shen. She returned Akane's searching look with a  friendly smile and a hesitant look of recognition, but avoided her because of  Ranma who remained close to her side the entire way. Shampoo and Ukyo were too  busy arguing under their breath, and Fa Shen put more distance between herself  and all four teens when she heard the name "Ranma" a few too many times. It  seemed strange to her to be identified as someone she had no memory of having  ever been. That was enough to suggest that she had not been a victim of Xi Fa  Xiang Gao shiatsu. A person did not forget what happened to them while under  its influence. They only forgot what was locked away by the technique. So, her  symptoms were closer to those of demonic possession. At least, if she was  willing to believe that she had spent enough time living as "Ranma" to  establish the identity in people's minds. As she followed Cologne into the  clinic, she sighed and shook her head.</p><p>"I don't understand what is going on," she complained  aloud.</p><p>Cologne glanced back at her thoughtfully, then directed  her to resume her perch on the examination table while the others filed in  around them. Fa Shen did so, frowning at the twitching body that still lay on  the other half of the table. One hand shot out from the charred form of  Happosai, straining to touch the pretty girl he sensed near him. Settling on  the very edge to keep her distance, Fa Shen turned to look at Cologne, who had  settled on a stool at her knee and waited for her attention. After studying the  girl for a long moment, she cleared her throat and jogged the girl's memory.</p><p>"Do you remember what I was saying, before we were  interrupted?"</p><p>Fa Shen nodded. "You asked me if I remembered the last  time I'd gone to Jusenkyo." She blushed, remembering her panic when the  physician, Tofu, had referred to his study of Jusenkyo and she feared he was  about to reveal she had been cursed. If she remembered correctly, that was one way  to obtain a new personality and suffer prolonged blackouts. She found herself  breaking out into a cold sweat. She noticed that once more she was the center  of troubled and indirect attention.</p><p>"And?" Cologne prompted.</p><p>"I visited it with my mother a few years ago," she  replied easily, remembering their return from the Emperor's Court. Her mother  had shown her the springs and revealed that one of them might unlock the  potential her training had failed to tap. Fa Shen had considered what her  mother told her and concluded that no amount of power was worth embracing a  curse that would turn her into a man. Rather than speak of that, she reminded  her elder, "You know we are forbidden to enter the accursed valley without special  permission."</p><p>"Also, in times of need, warriors are allowed to use the  springs to confound the enemy," Cologne corrected gently, smiling.</p><p>"Of course. Only a warrior of great skill can cross the  valley with impunity," Fa Shen returned, remembering her training. It was a  common tactic for amazon warriors to retreat from conflicts with overwhelming  numbers by leading them into the valley of accursed springs. Another warrior  might be able to pursue across the bamboo poles, but he would still have to be  cautious, and mere soldiers were doomed if they dared to march through the  springs.</p><p>"Have you ever had occasion to use this path of retreat?"</p><p>"I don't th…" Fa Shen trailed off, her eyes narrowing as  she sensed the deliberation of these questions. Cologne was not seeking  information from her. She already had it. She was prompting Fa Shen to  recognize that information for herself. That meant… With widening eyes, she  gasped, "Yes. I did."</p><p>With that admission, she felt a door opening in her mind.  The hunting party she had been assigned to had stumbled into an ambush. They  had fought their way free, but hundreds of Musk warriors were pursuing them. Fa  Shen had felt that the traditional escape route would not work, but the senior  member of the party silenced her and led them, and their enemies, to the source  of their conflict. The image of rushing through the forest, breaking into the  clear to see all of Jusenkyo spreading out under a thick blanket of fog, played  through her inner eye. The tops of the poles could be seen above the dense  layer of moisture. For a moment, that had made her feel hopeful. All but the  best of their pursuers would think twice about daring a crossing under such  conditions.</p><p>"Do you remember what happened?" Cologne's voice intruded  on the memory. Fa Shen refocused her gaze on the old woman, and felt the back  of her mind screaming for her not to look for an answer.</p><p>Unfortunately, the scene was already playing out. Her  people had been mistaken to believe they had discovered the identities of all  the traitors in their midst. They had missed dozens; girls who had secretly  been boys the entire time they had been growing up. How did this happen? The  Musk had tempted amazon mothers who desired strong daughters, offering the use  of the Chisuiiton to seal the forbidden transformations. Later, those girls  were approached and confronted with their true nature, pressured into acting as  spies for the Musk. Her friends. Why had they betrayed her? Because her enemy,  her nemesis, had control of the power to lock and unlock their curses. And what  had been their reward for leading her into this trap in Jusenkyo? They had been  denied the touch of the Kaisuifuu, laughed at and mocked by men who were  descended from animals. She shuddered. Not just mocked, but raped. All of them  had been raped. Except for herself. She closed her eyes and covered her face.</p><p>"I died," she finally answered in a small voice. "…" She  had opened her mouth to speak, but no words would form. She was trapped in the final  moments of her life, as they played out in her memory. Her eyes locked on the  boy her rage had focused on, and she saw a reflection of her own horror, as if  he too could see her death unfolding. The girl beside him, Akane, stared at her  in painful sympathy. Fa Shen stared around and looked at the rest, and  discovered that none of them were truly shocked by her revelation. They all  knew. They saw her, talked to her, touched her or even fought with her, but  they had known all along that she was dead. The implication hit her like an  avalanche. Curling up on herself, hugging her knees to her chest and staring at  the unfamiliar clothes she had awakened wearing, she fought to keep from  screaming. Words finally came spilling out in a rush, "I don't understand. I  mean, I should have realized when I found myself in such a strange land.  Everything is unfamiliar. Is this the after life?" She focused on the teens in  the room and tried to console herself with the fact that she was not the only  one struck down so young.</p><p>"No child. This is the future." Cologne's simple  statement rang in the silence for a moment. Fa Shen swallowed and jerked around  to stare at her incredulously.</p><p>"Wha- How can that be?" she cried, the numb acceptance  that had only just begun to form shattered by the ridiculous assertion.</p><p>Cologne sighed and proceeded to tell her the history of  the world she had grown up in. Speaking of her own birth twelve-hundred years  after Fa Shen's death, and growing up with the legends of past heroines and the  particular legend of the prodigy no one could forget, because so many had been  cursed in her image over the ages. A virgin girl who was, through those  surrogates, the mother to hundreds and ancestor of thousands. A girl who,  according to the rarest legends of Jusenkyo, might one day be resurrected through  one of those cursed by her grave. Then, while the girl was struggling to deal  with that, the old woman mentioned the birth of a boy named Ranma Saotome,  sketching his brief life, the torturous training he underwent, and the foolish  decision of the father to take his son to Jusenkyo.</p><p>"So, this young man was knocked into the spring where you  perished. Like so many before him, but few in his generation, he took your  form. When I first saw him, I recognized the possibility and watched him as  commanded by your mother's last wish. I held little hope of your resurrection,  I confess, because I could not imagine you being reincarnated as a foreigner or  a male. I see now my own pride blinded me," Cologne concluded.</p><p>Fa Shen sat there stiffly, struggling against belief, but  as her resistance began to collapse she was left to confront the final  implications of the Matriarch's tale. The key to her resurrection was her  reincarnation, who and what she was in the present tense. She flushed darkly  then went cold all over. She stretched out and looked at herself, and suddenly  realized why her clothes fit her so terribly. They were cut for a taller  person, with rather different proportions. "I- I'm a BOY!" she gasped jumping  to her feet. "NO!"</p><p>"In that body," Cologne interrupted her, trying to calm  her by explaining, "only when you are doused with hot water." She made a  gesture and Fa Shen whipped around to see Dr. Tofu standing there with a  pitcher of water. Before she could object, he raised it over her head and  poured. She felt the hot water, and an itching tingle passing through her body.  Something like a bolt of lightening shot through her nervous system. She  convulsed and began to drop unconscious. The reaction was as fast as the  transformation, and as Tofu lunged forward to catch the drenched boy, he seemed  to regain his balance and clap his hands to his head.</p><p>"Oh, my head!" he moaned, obviously reeling in confusion.  Centering himself, and bracing one hand on the edge of the examination table,  he squinted up at everyone, "What happened?"</p><p>"Fa Shen?" Dr. Tofu inquired cautiously.</p><p>"Fa…?" the boy stared with wide eyes, unutterable  disbelief on his face.</p><p>"Ranma?" the doctor tried again, looking more concerned.</p><p>"Oh no. I turned into her, didn't I?" Ranma-kun moaned.</p><p>"Quite entirely. How very peculiar that she'd just vanish  like that." Dr. Tofu frowned and set the pitcher down. Everyone was staring at  Ranma-kun in confusion, though the teens all showed obvious relief. Before  anyone could say anything, Dr. Tofu picked up the pitcher beside the one he had  just set down and tipped it over the boy's head, dousing him in cold water.</p><p>"Hey! What did you do that for?" Ranma-chan snapped,  blinking the water out of her eyes angrily and pulling the fabric plastered to  her breasts away from her skin. By pure reflex, she began to wring her shirt  and pants out while Tofu studied her curiously.</p><p>"Fa Shen?" he asked experimentally. The girl jerked and  glared at him.</p><p>"You tried to turn me back into her!" she shouted,  indignant.</p><p>"Where did she go?" Akane covered her mouth after  blurting the question on everyone's mind. There was another round of confused  looks and shrugs. Cologne was frowning intently, as Dr. Tofu rubbed his chin in  thought. Though concern remained on everyone's face, there was more on the  minds of those two than just relief that the old Ranma had not been utterly  lost.</p><p>"This is not good," Cologne met the doctor's eye. She  ignored the glare from the cursed girl and stated her conclusion. "They're  operating as two separate personalities."</p><p>Dr. Tofu nodded and set the second pitcher down. Ukyo  swallowed and edged forward. It was obvious he had set the water up to  demonstrate the curse to Fa Shen. Equally obvious that he had not considered  the shock would allow Ranma to resurface. Glancing at the second pitcher, and  then at Ranma-chan, she ventured.</p><p>"Were you hoping she would come back with her proper  form?"</p><p>"No. But then, I wasn't expecting her to vanish because  of his form, so I was prepared to be wrong. Now I have established that her  control was not dependant on the curse," Tofu replied, confirming her thoughts  for everyone in the room. He sat on a stool and regarded Ranma-chan calmly.  Ranma-chan tried not to glare back. She might have wondered if the other girl  could only surface while the curse was active too. Tofu slapped his knee, as he  came up with a hypothesis. "Apparently, this is similar to the nekoken. It has  a trigger, but the shock of the transformation can override her possession of  the body."</p><p>"Is it likely to happen again?" Ukyo shuffled nervously,  catching a look from Shampoo.</p><p>"Probably. Ranma-chan, do you remember being her?"</p><p>"No," she shook her head, looking scared but trying to  keep a lid on it. "One second I was watching Shampoo and Ukyo fight, and the  next, I was in the clinic, as a guy."</p><p>"What was the last thing you remember, before blacking  out?"</p><p>"They were shouting stuff at each other and me, and I was  shouting back. I think I said, 'I AM Fa Shen, even if I don't remember it' and  started to get light headed. I tried to get their attention, and asked them to  stop fighting, when someone said it was time to put a stop to this. Before I  could look to see who spoke, I was getting drenched with hot water."</p><p>"Very interesting." Dr. Tofu bowed his head to think  again. Ranma-chan sat there nervously, her eyes darting around the room. She  could remember the strange sensation of a presence suddenly looming over her  shoulder, the understanding of words, a thought, she was positive did not come  from her. Knowing that the threat was within made it very hard for her to sit  still. Of all the ways she might have become Fa Shen, this scared her the most.  She had never even considered she might be shoved aside, locked away and  oblivious to everything around her. If that was how it was going to be, she  might as well be dead! Rather than follow that line of thought, she continued  to stare all around her, until her eyes fell upon the charred form on the bed  beside her.</p><p>"What happened to Happosai?" she prodded the old pervert.</p><p>"You… ah," Cologne began, then cleared her throat to  continue her reply. "Fa Shen, did not, ahem, approve of his greeting."</p><p>"It looks like he was struck by lightening!"</p><p>"That's not a bad description of it."</p><p>"She decked him with a bolt of lightening!" Ranma-chan  stared up at Cologne in surprise. She had been told that Fa Shen had been a  master of chi manipulation but this was way beyond what she had suspected. She  created lightening! "Is that possible?"</p><p>"You've created tornados with chi, why should lightening  come as a surprise?" Ukyo frowned, not seeing the reason for Ranma-chan's disbelief.</p><p>"I've never seen anyone else do that!" Ranma-chan retorted.</p><p>"What about Kuno?" Akane asked with a grin.</p><p>"Er…" Ranma-chan and Ranma both reacted to that one. They  exchanged a look, aware that they had synched up, then looked over at Cologne. The  old woman realized she was supposed to confirm that the eerie coincidence of lightening  punctuating Kuno's pre-battle monologues as just that, mere coincidence. She grinned  at them.</p><p>"In his case, it's an unconscious talent," she informed  them. Cackling at the look of terror that flashed in their eyes, she waved off  their concern. "I doubt he could use it against you in combat."</p><p>"What a relief!" they sagged.</p>
