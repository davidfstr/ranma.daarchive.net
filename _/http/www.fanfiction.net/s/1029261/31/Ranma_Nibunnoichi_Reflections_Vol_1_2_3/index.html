</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Thirty-One: Certain Sacrifices</p><p>From the roof of the Tendo  Dojo, Ranma watched the rising sun bring the world back to life with crisp and  vibrant color. She wanted to lose herself in the beauty of the brilliant blue  and white sky, the gold tinting of reflected light that traced the edges of  buildings, accenting their subdued, neutral tones, and the occasional flash of  emerald plant life. She marveled at the sensitivity of her new eyes to colors,  which rivaled the enhanced sense of touch of her delicate skin. It was hard not  to rub her hands over herself, but she resisted, reminding herself that it was  the same sensuality that betrayed her in her moment of awakening. She had the  strength of will to suppress those erotic memories, but the decision she had  spent most of the night struggling with had roused them repeatedly. It was  impossible to consider what she was obligated to do, to help Ranko, without  drifting into the pleasure such sacrifice entailed. Ranma would have preferred  outright torture. At least that would be manly. If only she could be sure that  she was not secretly grateful for the excuse to continue doing what she had  done with Ryouga, she could be a man about it. It would be easier to sacrifice  her manhood to save Ranko if she hated what she had to do. It was just wrong  that the path to certain destruction should be so fun and exciting.</p><p>Still, the thing that bothered her most was that she was  only afraid of how her decision would impact the people around her. How it  would alter the way they thought of her. It hurt that her decision could cost  her parents their son, one way or the other. She was still upset with herself  over how her desire to be a man had caused her to lash out at Ryouga. When she  came out of the bath and went upstairs to prepare for bed, they had passed in  the hall, and he had refused to even see her. Her father had nabbed her when  Nodoka was distracted and lectured her on her manly obligations, bringing up  the feelings she had inherited toward Akane. Even though they felt as real and  as strong as her feelings for Ryouga, she knew they were not her true feelings.  The sight of Akane supporting Ranko had made it clear that there were no  genuine feelings for her in Akane either. That seemed to be true of Shampoo and  Ukyo too. Why should they feel anything for Ranma, when it had really been  Ranko they had gone through so much with?</p><p>Soun and Genma had never shown much consideration for the  feelings of their children, in their marriage pact. Ranma might have  obligations as far as Akane and Ukyo went, but fulfilling those obligations  could only hurt those girls the way she had already hurt Ryouga. The one good  thing that could come out of her sacrifice would be a chance to make it up to  him. If, in the course of saving Ranko, she lost all desire to be a man, that  would no longer stand in the way of picking up where she and Ryouga had started.  If he could ever forgive her for how that night ended. It would be easy enough  to let Nodoka believe "Ranma" had died, since it would not be too far from the  truth. Genma would go along with it, since if the truth came out he'd have to  commit seppuku right next to his ruined son.</p><p>Ranma sighed. She was kidding herself. If it wasn't for  the contract, she would not give any of this a second thought. She'd sleep with  a hundred men if that's what it took, now that she knew it was far from  terrible, and still be just as inclined to be a man. She had no real desire to  give her manhood up. The problem with the contract was not even that she would  have to die to preserve her family honor. While not eager to die, there was no  question she was willing to lay down her life over a matter of honor. However  stupid the contract seemed, there might be a reason beyond sheer absurdity for  his mother to honor it. No, her concern about the contract was that if it were  upheld, it would take his entire family down. If one thing became certain,  after her talk with her mother, it was that she was not going to let her  parents die because of that contract. If Ranma needed to die, she would take  care of that in her own way, even if that meant literally. Genma would have to  make his own amends, find his own way to restore his honor, but it ultimately  could not be his fault if Ranma failed to be a man-among-men at this point.</p><p>Until she knew what it meant, in Nodoka's eyes, to be a  man-among-men, she would not allow the contract to dictate her decisions. That  left the question of what was the right thing for Ranma, as a martial artist,  to do. That made it simple. Ranko needed to recover all of her ki to break the  mirror's hold over her. Ranma knew how to ensure that. If this changed her  feelings about being a man, well, it was not like that had not been a danger  all along, because of the curse. If she was enough of a man, afterwards, she  would face whatever obligations that demanded of her. Frowning in thought, she  noted that the obvious expectations concerned the future, but it occurred to  her that there might be matters in the past and present she needed to address  while she was man enough, in spirit, to take care of them. Over the course of  the night, she had plenty of time to consider the deeds performed in her name  by Ranko. Ranko could not be held responsible, because there was no telling how  much she might have been influenced by Fa Shen's personality, or her own need  to discover herself as a person. Prior to the curse, Ranma had always been  obedient to his father. From the memories she now had, the curse had created a  person who lacked the trust and respect Ranma owed in spite of all his father's  faults.</p><p>Ranma could not resolve the problems created by the  engagement, but recognized that it would be dishonorable for her to fight  Genma, Soun and Akane as her surrogate had. The multiple engagements created  enough problems and conflict, and she would have to take responsibility for  that mess. Not a pleasant thing to look forward to. Ryouga was another problem.  Not just the emotional attachment, Ranma had to do something about the whole  P-chan situation with Akane. By turning Ranma… Ranko's honor against her,  Ryouga had created a dishonorable situation for Ranko, Akane and himself. The  worst thing, however, was the way Genma forced Ranko to hide from Nodoka.  Nabiki had been right. The situation should have been explained. Lying to her  was unforgivable, and Ranma resented having come into the middle of that  deception and ending up contributing to it. She shuddered at the thought of  trying to fix that problem. In retrospect, lying to her had been the correct  thing to do, but unless Nodoka could understand that, it was not safe to  enlighten her.</p><p>"Damn. I know it's not your fault, Ranko, but you sure  made a mess out of my life!" she growled.</p><p>"Oh, she had help, no question of that!" Cologne  chuckled.</p><p>Ranma jumped straight up in shock. She had not heard the  old woman sneaking up on her. "Dammit! I hate when you do that!" she growled,  landing softly on her toes, braced for combat. Relaxing, she settled back where  she had been seated. "What do you want, old woman?"</p><p>After delivering the obligatory skull-crack with her  staff, Cologne perched on it in front of the girl. "I actually came up here to  enjoy the sunrise and warm my old bones, youngster. However, seeing as you seem  to be wrestling with things, I don't see any harm in offering my counsel."</p><p>"You came all the way over here to 'warm your bones'?"  Ranma challenged skeptically.</p><p>"I see you have been distracted quite a bit longer than I  expected, child. In case you had not noticed, Kasumi deemed it too late, when  we concluded our meeting last night, for people to return to their homes. As  Happi never returned from the clinic, I availed myself of the use of his room,  with Shampoo and Mousse. Ukyo shared Akane's room and Ryouga slept in the dojo,"  Cologne informed.</p><p>Ranma sighed, smirking. "Great. The gang's still all  here." She stretched and ran her fingers through her hair, noticing she had  forgotten to braid it before going to sleep. Ironically, braiding her hair into  the characteristic pig-tail was something that was after her time. Ranma had  usually just tied his long hair back in a pony-tail. Producing a string, she  proceeded to do just that, asking Cologne to fill her in on the meeting, since  she had been with Nodoka while it was going on.</p><p>Cologne covered the highlights.</p><p>"You're kidding! Mousse challenged Ranko to a marriage  duel, and Ryouga…?" she could not finish past the sudden stab to her heart.</p><p>Cologne saw her cringe and clutch her chest in pain and  shrewdly overlooked it. "That is correct. The boy wishes to challenge Shampoo's  claim, no doubt to position himself to challenge Shampoo directly, before the  council can rule on Ranko's eligibility."</p><p>"So Shampoo isn't going to be after me?"</p><p>"I am not sure that anyone is after you at the moment,  but no, Shampoo has no claim to you. You would need to regain your manhood and  defeat her in combat to regain her interest."</p><p>"Like I'd wanna do that!" Ranma scowled.</p><p>"Oh? Perhaps someone else has caught your fancy? A  certain wandering young man, perhaps?" Cologne prodded.</p><p>Ranma jerked. Looking away she shook her head, "Echoes of  someone else. Besides, I don't think he'd be interested anymore." Ranma tried  to change the subject, "Say, if the Kiss of Marriage is not gonna shift to me,  what about the other one?"</p><p>"The Kiss of Death? No, that one has already been  dissolved. If Ranko chooses to remain entirely female, the Kiss of Marriage  will be dissolved too, though that is no protection from Mousse. With no option  of claiming Shampoo as his bride, he certainly would take marriage to Ranko  more seriously."</p><p>"That's a status thing?"</p><p>Cologne nodded.</p><p>"Well," Ranma sighed, "first he'd have to be able to  defeat her. I'm kinda tempted to go kick his head in for thinkin' he can use  her like that to get to Shampoo!"</p><p>"I would not recommend that. On the off chance you slipped  and knocked yourself out, it could be you who had to marry him," Cologne  laughed.</p><p>Ranma slowly turned to meet her eye and stared hard. "What!"</p><p>Cologne grinned, "You and Ranko have several things in  common at the moment, starting with being permanently female and legitimate  reincarnations of Fa Shen. Those two things are enough to make you both  recognizable as amazon warriors."</p><p>Ranma burst to her feet in dismay. "You mean I have to  marry any jerk who can beat me up! What does that mean if I go back to being a  guy!"</p><p>"Well, that would come as a shock to the tribe. It is  quite unusual for a reincarnated warrior to remain male, if that is how they  were reborn, after being reunited with the tribe. However, when it happens, the  'man' is regarded as an honorary woman. It usually is necessary for 'her' to  accept and use the female form given by the nyanniichaun, though 'she' is  allowed to take wives instead of husbands," Cologne snickered.</p><p>"So, because of Fa Shen, I'm always gonna have to be a  girl?"</p><p>"If you did not always reject it out of hand, you might  just find you could enjoy it, child," Cologne finally laughed out loud. She  stopped at the odd look on Ranma's face as she shouted her response.</p><p>"That's the problem! Are you forgetting that stupid  contract!"</p><p>Cologne sighed and composed herself. "In point of fact, I  have not. However, as you have put it, 'stupid' is an appropriate description.  I would also assert that stupidity is one of honor's greatest adversaries. I  fail to see the honor in a contract intended to diminish the potential and  capacity of one's own offspring."</p><p>"Heh. You mean, you wish I was a girl. An amazon girl."</p><p>"You are," Cologne stated, turning to excuse herself.</p><p>Ranma scowled and sulked as she left. As much as she did  not appreciate having any more encouragement to abandon her manhood, it was a  small relief to think she had some options if she ended up losing it. Scrubbing  her face with her hands, she tried to dismiss the things Cologne had given her  to think about. Unfortunately, she was not allowed to, as Mousse came over the  peak of the roof.</p><p>"She has no idea how true that is," the blind boy  announced, striding purposefully toward the red-head and squatting down to meet  her eyes. With a knowing grin, he continued, before she could speak. "I had a  little talk with Ryouga, last night. Your lover needs to learn not to think out  loud."</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about," she instantly  denied.</p><p>Mousse adjusted his glasses and noticed how pale she  suddenly was. "There's no reason to deny it, Saotome. Personally, the only  thing that shocked me was learning that you were a virgin until last night.  From the way you two carried on, I thought you had indulged yourselves many  times already."</p><p>"You might wanna give your last words more thought,  Mousse," she grated dangerously. Behind her anger was an overwhelming outrage  that Ryouga had been so careless! However, she held on tight and tried to  discourage Mousse. "It's pretty stupid to mistake someone's fantasies for  reality. Of course, you never could tell the difference yourself, so I'll just  have to remind you!" She rose to her feet and prepared to cut loose.</p><p>"Relax, Saotome," Mousse backed away and stared off the  edge of the roof. "All Ryouga actually let slip was that sex had to be the source  of the ki that you gave Ranko, since that was the only new thing you both did  last night. If I did not depend so much on my ears to get by, I would never  have heard what he was muttering to himself. I doubt anyone else could have.  However," he turned back to the girl, "what really interests me is what he  admitted to when I asked him what he was talking about. All he said was that  you figured out how to heal her. Since he will not talk to you—it seems you broke  his heart—he asked me to speak to you on his behalf and urge you to heal her."</p><p>Ranma dropped bonelessly to her rear. "I am screwed," she  moaned.</p><p>"You WERE screwed, if you want to be accurate about your  tenses," Mousse grinned, pacing forward to stare down at her. "I do believe I  know what you meant, however. It would probably be bad if your mother learned  of this, so I will promise you now, as long as you agree to hear me out and  give me an honest reply, that I will never even hint about what I have or will  learn about your sexual exploits. Is that reasonable?" Mousse asked pointedly.</p><p>Ranma sucked in a deep breath and then nodded cautiously.  Mousse sighed and moved to sit down next to her. Ranma studied his face and  noticed he seemed ashamed of himself. "What do you want, Mousse?"</p><p>"I must ask two things of you, Ranma. Since you've been  told about my challenge to Ranko, I want to make sure you understand my  intentions first," he announced, before repeating the conversation he had with  Fa Shen the other night. He then confirmed what happened when he delivered his  challenge to Ranko. "It goes without saying, Ryouga is not happy with me, but  even knowing she has to fight me as soon as she is able, he told me to tell you  this. 'Heal Ranko. Take Ranko's advice and get Fa Shen to help you.' He said  you need a guy to help you—which is obvious when you know what he's talking  about—but that he can't be that guy. Since this is also my first request, I  strongly urge you to speak to Fa Shen at once."</p><p>"What's your second request?"</p><p>"Well, it's the same one I made of Fa Shen. I need your  help to train so that I can defeat Ranko," he admitted.</p><p>"I don't need you to tell me to do the first, and you  should know I would not help you like that against Ranko. I can't do that to  her," Ranma bit her lip.</p><p>"So. I guess I should go tell everyone the good news  about you and Ryouga then," Mousse threatened.</p><p>"Fine. Then start running, I'll catch up to you when I've  taken care of things here," Ranma replied woodenly, fighting to remain still.</p><p>Mousse sighed. "I'm not going to tell. I never planned  to. Damn you, Saotome. I need your help. Weren't you listening? I am only  interested in another shot at Shampoo!"</p><p>"You just tried to blackmail me. I'm supposed to trust  what you say!"</p><p>Mousse sagged and looked away. "Like you would have  helped if I just asked for it!" he accused disdainfully.</p><p>"You never tried asking."</p><p>"Fine. I am asking!" he huffed.</p><p>Ranma shrugged and climbed to her feet. She walked to the  edge of the roof and turned before responding. "You're asking the wrong person.  If Ranko says I can help you, then I will." She jumped down and began racing to  the clinic to see Fa Shen. The best she could do for Ranko right now was to  help her recover quickly, so Mousse had as little time as possible to train for  their challenge. Because of her short stature, she was already at a serious  disadvantage fighting Mousse, as their first combat had proven. Only with ki  attacks at her disposal could she win against him now.</p><p>In spite of feeling weaker  than she could ever remember feeling, Ranko had not been very tired. Part of  that stemmed from the hours she had been in a trance, through which her body  had apparently slept. So, despite the late hour when she had finally gone to  bed, she had awakened well before sunrise and listened to Ranma toss and turn  listlessly in the futon beside her. Because of Nodoka's presence, and general  fatigue, she had not started a conversation with her obviously insomniac twin.  She regretted that when the other girl threw aside her covers and slipped out  the window. Something weighed very heavily on Ranma's conscience, Ranko  concluded, and wished she had the strength to climb out after her to find out  what it was. As the sun came up and gently lit the room, Ranko grew more and  more restless, worrying about Ranma, until she finally had to get up. That was  a painful process, since even with her ki boosted by what Ranma had poured into  her, she was still operating on the dregs of her spirit. Grateful to have her  balance and coordination at least, she strained and panted to crawl out of bed  and drag her body over to the door. By the time she reached it, the sound of  her struggles woke up Nodoka, who was instantly at her side.</p><p>"Ranko! You should not be exerting yourself!" she cried  softly. Ranko chuckled and continued to fight to her feet, using the door frame  for support. Nodoka lent her strength, but pulled her back into an embrace. "Shhh.  Just relax and tell me where you're in such a hurry to go?" the woman crooned.</p><p>"The bathroom, for starters," the girl winced, suddenly  noticing the pressure on her bladder. That got Nodoka moving. She slipped one  of Ranko's arms over her shoulder, put one of her own around the girl's waist  and carefully walked her to the upstairs bathroom, next door to the guest room.  The small room offered only a sink, toilet and mirror, but that was all that  was needed. Ranko blushed, but accepted the woman's help removing her pants and  positioning herself on the toilet.</p><p>"I hate not being able to take care of myself," she  complained as her mother cleaned her up, moments later.</p><p>"There is no need to be ashamed of taking help when you  need it," Nodoka soothed, sensing the girl's embarrassment. She stood the girl up,  bracing her with a shoulder to pull her panties back up, but left the pants off  at her insistence.</p><p>"It's that much less for me to struggle against to move,"  Ranko pointed out, as they reentered the hall. "Do you mind helping me  downstairs? I'd like to get a bath in before everyone wakes up, since I'm  moving so slow."</p><p>"I don't think you are in any condition to bathe  yourself, young lady. I will take you down stairs however. I am sure Kasumi won't  mind helping you when she comes down for her bath," Nodoka proposed. The girl  shrugged, just grateful to be out of her room. Before her thoughts could  wander, Nodoka surprised her by asking, "Seeing the price you've paid, was this  attempt at a cure worth it?"</p><p>"I- excuse me?" Ranko was stunned. She suddenly  remembered what Nabiki told her, about the confrontation with Kuno. "Oh. I  suppose it was. If I had not blundered into it, Ranma would never have been  able to get free," she observed thoughtfully.</p><p>"Are you saying the cure was a success?" Nodoka  brightened.</p><p>Ranko shook her head sadly. "Not a complete success.  There are some problems that have to be taken care of before Ranma will be able  to get back to normal," she hedged carefully. It was ironic that, now, Ranma  had to be cursed to fix the side effects of the "cure" for Ranko's curse.</p><p>Nodoka concentrated on steering them both down the  stairs, not speaking until they reached the main floor. "Can you explain why  one of you has to die to overcome this curse?" Nodoka begged. Ranko stared at  her and asked her to explain exactly what "Ranneko" had said to give her that  idea. Nodoka hesitated, deciding to take the girl into the Tea Room and sit her  at the table before repeating the conversation she had with Ranma in the bath  the night before. While she was talking, Cologne entered and sat herself on the  edge of the table to listen. When Nodoka completed her recitation, she turned  to the old woman. "I don't believe we've been introduced. I am Nodoka Saotome."</p><p>"Ah, yes. Ranma's mother. It is a great pleasure to meet  you Nodoka. I am Cologne, Matriarch of the Jokezoku," she smiled and held out  her hand. Nodoka took her hand in friendship and smiled at the old woman in  surprise.</p><p>"You're kidding! You can't mean the fabled tribe of  Chinese Amazons!" Nodoka laughed in amusement. Cologne's eyes widened,  surprised that the woman recognized the name, but simply nodded firmly. "You're  not kidding." Nodoka blinked off her surprise. "I am so sorry. I did not mean  to offend. My father used to tell me stories about the Jokezoku. I thought they  were just fairy tales! Imagine that! And here you are, the real thing!"</p><p>Cologne's eyes narrowed slightly with interest. "I don't  suppose you could tell me about these stories of his? I'd be most interested to  learn what legends of our people have traveled so far."</p><p>"Oh, I haven't heard any since I was a little girl,"  Nodoka waved it off. "I doubt I can remember more than how he used to tease me  about my mother. She died when I was born, you see, so all I know about her  were the stories he told me, and of course he tried to make her sound very  exotic." Nodoka sighed. With a laugh, she went on to explain, "I used to be  very self conscious of my hair color, you see. When I was a girl, my hair was  as red as Ranko's here. My father would try to comfort me by saying that, where  my mother came from, hair like mine was quite normal compared to the other  women in her 'tribe'!"</p><p>Cologne smirked. "Well, if he was talking about the  Jokezoku, he certainly was not wrong about that! You should see my  Great-Granddaughter!"</p><p>Nodoka thought back. "Would she be the girl with the  purple-hair I saw coming out of the guest room when Ranneko and I went to bed?"</p><p>"That would be the one. However, I can't say that your  father's stories could be true. I've been around quite some time and I don't  recall losing one of our girls to a foreigner, who could possibly be your  mother," Cologne noted skeptically. Her own suspicions, however, as she studied  the woman, suggested that Nodoka's mother might well have been a victim of the  nyanniichaun. One who bore the stamp of Fa Shen. Knowing she could not mention  this to Nodoka, she probed in another direction, "I don't suppose I could meet  your father? I think I might enjoy learning how he became acquainted with our  tribe."</p><p>"I am sorry to say, he died about a month or so ago. I  was hoping to learn from him if little Ranko here, and now her sister, might be  related to me or my mother," Nodoka replied, with a tinge of resurfaced grief.</p><p>"I am sorry to hear that," Cologne sighed. Death was  Mystery's greatest ally, the ruthless protector of her secrets. She allowed  herself a smile, however, imagining the woman's reaction to discovering Ranko's  true relation to her. Then, remembering the contract, shuddered. The  conversation drifted into talk of the amazon tribe, and an edited version of  how they became acquainted with Ranma. Kasumi arrived and the conversation  paused long enough for her to agree to help Ranko bathe. After they exited, Nodoka  continued to ask her questions and found herself intrigued by the different  views of the amazons, especially as they pertained to the status of women.  Cologne was just revealing that Ranko and "Ranneko" were considered amazons  through reincarnation, when Akane stumbled down stairs and approached.</p><p>Seeing the girl wished to talk to her, Cologne  interrupted herself and turned to her. "Good morning, Akane. Is there something  I can do for you?"</p><p>"Good morning. Actually, I just wanted to know if you  wanted this back?" Akane reached into the pocket of her robe and pulled out the  bottle of water Cologne had tossed her, after pouring most of its contents on  Ranko to lock her curse. She carefully handed it over to the ancient amazon.</p><p>Cologne stretched out her hand gratefully, "Yes, indeed.  Thank you, Akane." She was about to return the bottle to the pocket where its  sister resided when she noticed something odd. Peering closely, she noticed  that one corner of the label was peeling off. She almost dismissed it when she  noticed that there seemed to be another label underneath it. A frigid jolt  sparked down her spine, as she carefully peeled the top layer off and looked at  what was underneath it. With shaking hands, she pulled out the other bottle and  stared at the label. The two were identical. Without hesitation, she sprung to  her feet and raced to the bathroom, praying it was not too late.</p><p>Akane was instantly worried by the woman's actions.  Having peered over Cologne's shoulder, she had seen the discovery of the other  label, and the comparison. Remembering the explanation from the previous night,  she gasped in terror and raced after the diminutive woman. When she saw Cologne  burst through the doors of the washroom and furo, she knew the worst was  inevitable. Cologne was shouting as she entered.</p><p>"Ranko! Stay away from hot water!"</p><p>"Cologne!" Kasumi's startled voice came out.</p><p>"What's wrong!" rang Ranko's panicked cry, followed by  the sound of water splashing and naked flesh hitting the tiles.</p><p>Akane pushed past Cologne, who had frozen in shock on  entering the bathroom, and looked down at Ranko. She was panting, laying  sprawled on the bathroom floor, with wisps of steam rising from her wet skin. Only  terror inspired by Cologne's shout had given her the strength to thrust herself  out of the bath, but the effort left her too exhausted to resist gravity as it  crushed her to the ground.</p><p>"This is impossible!" Cologne gasped.</p><p>"Ranko? Are you okay!" Akane was instantly beside the  girl, pulling her up into her lap as she knelt on the hard tiles.</p><p>"I can barely move," the red head responded, close to hyperventilating.  She flopped as Akane wrestled her around so she could sit back against her  body. With her head aimed roughly in Cologne's direction, she fought to lift  her chin and look at the old woman. "What's going on?" she gasped.</p><p>"You were in the bath?" Cologne demanded.</p><p>Kasumi nodded, "We've been in here for several minutes. I  didn't want her to catch cold, so I washed her as quickly as I could and  brought her in to soak with me."</p><p>It was obvious the girl had not changed. Cologne sagged,  holding a hand over her heart. "Thank the heavens. It was a false alarm! Please  forgive the intrusion, girls. Ranko, you can go back in and finish your bath."</p><p>"What happened? Why were you so scared?"</p><p>Cologne held out the bottles and the loose label. "I  thought I used the wrong water to lock her curse. If I had, though, she would  already have evaporated," she took a deep breath and allowed herself a nervous  laugh. "I must have reused an antidote bottle for the chisuiiton water."</p><p>Cologne and Akane returned to the Tea Room and resumed  their seats. Faced with Nodoka's alarm, Cologne simply stated her fear of  having used the wrong medicine to help Ranko. Nodoka took the used bottle and  examined it as she listened to the explanation.</p><p>Frowning, Nodoka looked up. "It looks like ordinary  water. What is it supposed to do?"</p><p>"For you or me, that is ordinary water. It wouldn't do a  thing. But for someone cursed like Ranko, it was the only thing that saved her  life," Cologne explained. Seeing Nodoka's skeptical look she waved her hand. "Go  ahead. Drink it if you're curious. It won't do anything to you. But, believe  me, if I had been wrong about this, Ranko would already be a memory." Cologne  sagged. She was getting too old for such excitement.</p><p>Nodoka opened the bottle and paused. "So, it's just been  blessed or something?" Cologne nodded, and put the other bottle away. Nodoka  shrugged and took a sip. "Wow," she shivered. She had felt a shock go through her  body as she sipped. It had felt rather pleasant, actually. With a grin, she  tipped the vessel up. "It really does have something special," she commented,  before taking a long swallow and emptying the bottle.</p><p>Akane, still staring at Cologne, was the only one to  notice the elder jerk in alarm at Nodoka's words. Before she could speak,  however, the empty bottle thumped onto the table. Akane watched as Cologne  paled, before turning to look at Nodoka, half afraid of what she might see.  With a sigh, Akane saw Nodoka grinning to herself as she circled the mouth of  the bottle with a finger. Then she gasped.</p><p>"A- Auntie N-No-Nodoka!"</p><p>Nodoka looked up, confused. "What's wrong, Akane?"</p><p>"Y- your h-h-hair!" Akane pointed in disbelief.</p><p>Nodoka frowned and reached up to feel her hair. Her  immediate dread, that the water had perhaps caused her hair to fall out was  dismissed at once as she felt her thick, long hair still tied securely in a bun  at the back of her head. Still, the girl and the old woman were looking  completely flabbergasted, so she pulled at the knot securing it in a bun and  let her hair unravel, so she could pull it forward and look at it—now expecting  it to have turned white or something. "I suppose I should have known better  than to drink magical water. How irresponsible of you, Cologne," she chided,  preparing herself for a shock. She was not prepared to see the brilliant,  scarlet hue that had returned to her hair. "Good heavens! My color is back!"</p><p>Cologne and Akane turned to each other. Nodoka sprung to  her feet and danced out of the room in obvious delight as she celebrated this  magical transformation.</p><p>"Can you explain what just happened?" Akane croaked.</p><p>"Merciful Goddess. There is only one explanation," she  reached out for the bottle and pulled it carefully to her chest. At that  moment, Mousse walked through the room and asked if anyone had seen Ranko.  Cologne stared at him, then the bottle, and finally back up at him. She threw  the bottle at him, held up the label in her hand and demanded. "Mousse! Do you  know what this is? Or, more importantly, how it came to be mislabeled!" she  barked commandingly.</p><p>Mousse caught the bottle easily and looked at it. He  recognized the label at once. A second glance, leaning in close to read the  label in her hand, and he suddenly froze in terror. "You used this on Ranko!"  The old woman nodded, and Mousse pulled a similar bottle out of his pocket. "Quick!  Where is she!"<br/>Cologne rose to her feet and  glared at him, conveying the grief of a ruler as she announced, "Ranko has  taken a hot bath." Mousse let out an anguished cry and crumpled to the ground.</p><p>"No! I didn't mean…! I was just…" he choked and turned to  face Cologne. "You have to understand! I was just trying to protect myself! I  didn't want you to lock me in my cursed form!"</p><p>"You are an idiot, Mousse! Do you have any idea what you  have done!"</p><p>"I meant her no harm! I… I was ready to marry her!"</p><p>"Do not lie to me, child! You meant to use her!"</p><p>"But…" Akane tried to interrupt.</p><p>"Silence. Akane, he needs to learn the error of his ways."</p><p>"But…"</p><p>"Shhhh!" Cologne winked at her. Akane choked down her  protest and stared at Mousse. The matriarch glared down at him, where he was  prostrating himself before her, and demanded, "Mousse. Knowing what you have  done to Ranko, I ask you. What are your intentions?"</p><p>Mousse squawked and looked up in confusion. "Intentions!"</p><p>"Consider the situation and how it effects my  Great-Granddaughter."</p><p>Mousse swallowed hard. If he had just killed Ranko… He  shook his head violently and tears began to stream down his face. "No! No! It  was an accident. I will not claim… I will not use this to enslave Shampoo!"</p><p>Cologne stared him down. Mousse bowed his head. "I am  pleased to hear this, Mousse," she stated gently. The blind boy jerked up to a  kneeling position and stared at her in abject confusion.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Though you scheme and manipulate like the lowest sort of  criminal, you are true to your nature as a master of hidden weapons. It is all  bluff and bluster. Sleight of hand. Isn't it?" Mousse gawked at her,  wordlessly. "Why would you ignore the chance to claim Shampoo?"</p><p>"It is not worth Ranko's life. It is not worth Shampoo's  death."</p><p>"Well," Cologne sighed, "I suppose it is a good thing  Ranko is not dead, then. Isn't it?" She smiled as Mousse jumped to his feet,  and then keeled over in shock. She glanced over at Akane and chuckled. "However,  because of your stupidity, instead of locking her curse, you have caused me to  cure it," she delivered the final blow. It staggered Akane as much as Mousse.</p><p>"Whaaaat!" she howled in disbelief. "How can that be!"</p>
