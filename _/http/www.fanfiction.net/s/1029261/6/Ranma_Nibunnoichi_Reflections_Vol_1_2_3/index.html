</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Six: The Learning Experience</p><p>A  normal morning at the Tendo Dojo frequently consisted of morning battles  between Ranma and Genma, a rushed breakfast, and a leisurely walk to school.  Which is to say, as much possible time was set aside for actually getting to  school on account of the practical certainty that someone would intercept Ranma  and Akane before they could report to class. That being said, running late this  Monday morning was something of a boon to the two youths as they herded Ranma's  clones to school. Anyone intent on ambushing them had been perplexed by missing  them, and had rushed to school in the assumption that they had just missed  their targets.</p><p>Ranma, dragging Copy-chan by the hand,  rocketed towards Furinkan High via the rooftops of Nerima, while Akane raced  down the sidewalks below. Because she had Copy-kun by the hand, she was trying  more to escape any attention from straggling students. Bound to endure her  chaperonage by Ranma's declaration, he allowed her to drag him along without  comment.</p><p>The greatest danger, Ranma guessed, would  be that Kuno would wait in the school yard until the last bell. For various  reasons, Ranma did not look forward to having Kuno see him and Copy-chan  together. His insane notion that Ranma and the "Pig-tailed-girl" were having an  illicit affair, courtesy of dark sorcery on Ranma's part, did not need any further  encouragement. It had been fortunate that Kuno had been too concussed, after  blundering into Copy-chan's schemes to abduct Ranma, to be sure that anything  he had witnessed had been real. The memory of Kuno glomping Ranma-chan and  Copy-chan in the flooded mirror trap, raving, "Now there are TWO  Pig-tailed-goddesses!" was sure to have a prominent place in Ranma's nightmares  for years to come.</p><p>Unfortunately, by bringing both copies to  school, it was inevitable that Kuno would spot them and go ballistic. Out of  sheer, morbid curiosity, Ranma found himself wondering how Kuno's mind would  deal with one Ranma escorting his Pig-tailed-goddess while Akane led another  "Ranma" around by the hand. No doubt he would credit it to more dark magic from  the evil sorcerer Saotome.</p><p>Ranma groaned.</p><p>"What's the matter?" Copy-chan looked at  him in confusion.</p><p>"Nothing. You'll see soon enough," Ranma  spotted the school gates as the pair launched themselves over the last row of  houses. Sure enough, the kendoist was waiting between them and the front  entrance.</p><p>"Long have the Heavens wept, that so foul  a smear on the face of creation has run amok, unvanquished, lo these past  months," Tatewaki Kuno began spouting as he spotted Ranma streaking down from  the sky. "Today, this atrocity shall end at the hands of I, the Blue Thunder of  Furinkan High School! Bow down, black-hearted sorcerer, and taste the divine  wrath of Kuno Tatewaki!"</p><p>"Yo, Kuno," Ranma greeted him offhandedly  as he landed before his self-appointed rival. The echo of Copy-chan's landing  treaded closely on the heels of Ranma's, and the girl stepped out of his shadow  into Kuno's line of sight.</p><p>"Hey! It's the pervert-with-the-bokan!"</p><p>"Oh! My Pig-tailed-goddess!" Kuno almost  bounded forward, but stopped at the sight of the girl's hand held firmly in  Ranma's. "Saotome! How dare you flaunt your unholy enslavement of the ravishing  Pig-tailed-girl! Unhand her, you cur!" Kuno tensed once more into a threatening  position. It was unspeakable that for once the majesty of his presence had not  forced the dog to flee from the side of the fair maiden. Truly his command of  the dark arts was growing!</p><p>Sighing, Ranma calmly walked forward,  stepping inside Kuno's guard to meet him eye to eye at close range. His hand  swept the wooden sword out of line as he advanced. In spite of himself, the  kendoist was forced to cringe back or allow himself to retreat before this  demon. "Kuno. I am running late already. You gonna talk or fight?"</p><p>"You are good at hiding your fear, foul  serpent! I fight!" Kuno sprung into action. He struck first at Ranma's arm,  seeking to sever the connection between him and Copy-chan. Copy-chan saw this  and instantly whipped Ranma around behind her, out of the line of Kuno's  strike. Her foot had snapped up to Kuno's chin without thought, launching him  over the school.</p><p>Ranma jerked her around and shouted into  her face, "What do you think you're doin'? That's butting in on a man to man  fight!"</p><p>Copy-chan leaned back and shrugged. "I didn't  mean to. It just sort of happened." Ranma stared down at her. The bulk of  martial arts was conditioned reflex. With all the techniques he had passed on  to his clones, was it also possible that he had passed on a gut level instinct  to pummel Kuno? He relaxed to ponder this for a moment. She looked at him for a  bit, and then, "Didn't you just say you were late for class?"</p><p>"Oh. Not quite," Ranma blinked, glancing  up at the clock. "Let's go!"</p><p>The two raced inside, side by side. Having  been here before, Copy-chan did not need to be led. As they reached the third  floor classroom and entered, they saw boys and girls huddled around various  desks in conversation. Various eyes turned their way as Ranma led her to his  desk. A second wave of stares turned on them as people realized Copy-chan was  following him.</p><p>"Hey, Ranma! I thought you were gonna get  rid of her?"</p><p>"What is she still doing here?"</p><p>"Alright! We still have a chance!"</p><p>"So, it's true," this last comment came  from Ukyo. She had sprung from her desk to intercept Ranma. She had been absent  the week before dealing with restaurant business, and had only heard rumors  about a second Ranma-chan. Now she stood before Ranma, studying the girl  intently, bursting with curiosity. "What exactly is going on here, Ranchan?"</p><p>"Oh. Hi, Ucchan!" Ranma smiled at her. "I  guess I should explain all this," he rubbed the back of his head in faint  embarrassment. He quickly related the tale of the cursed mirror and what had  happened when he had tried to return the girl to where she came from. Even as  he was explaining that the other copy was a boy, Akane slipped into the room  with Copy-kun. This caused quite a sensation in the classroom. Ukyo looked over  in astonishment, and then her gaze traveled down to see the boy's hand held  firmly in Akane's.</p><p><i>Well.  This is interesting, </i>she thought  to herself.</p><p>Ranma,  Ukyo and Copy-chan wandered over to Akane, noticing the distressed look on her  face. The five huddled in a circle, shutting out the excited questions and  speculation of the class. In a hushed voice, Akane explained how she had  attempted to sneak Copy-kun in through the rear entrance when Kuno had come  flying over the school and crashed in front of them. Before they could step  around him, he sprung up and began accosting Copy-kun for cozying up to the  Pig-tailed-girl and Akane, both in one morning. Copy-kun, still somewhat upset  over the scene in the bathroom with Ranma-chan, interpreted "Pig-tailed-girl"  to mean "Ranma-chan" and went into a fit of apoplexy. He could not understand  how this strange boy could know about the incident, but for daring to rub his  nose in it, he had proceeded to kick the stuffing out of the kendoist. Ukyo  listened until her eyes narrowed.</p><p>"What  did you do to Ranchan!" she demanded.</p><p>As Ranma  went to open his mouth, Akane clapped her hand over it in a panic. On the verge  of hyperventilating, her hair standing on end, she turned to Ukyo and said,  "There was a little misunderstanding this morning. Copy-kun, here, has a little  thing for Copy-chan. Of course he can't tell her apart from Ranma in girl form.  You don't want to know the details, just believe me, nothing really happened."  Ranma pried her hand away from his mouth.</p><p>"I could  have told her that! What's the big idea?"</p><p>"I…"  Akane gulped. "Let's just say, it's better not to hear these things from your  mouth. You have a way of, um, confusing people." Akane was blushing hard enough  to light a room. Ukyo's eyes went wide, but she wisely decided not to press for  the moment. She was more interested in the fact that Copy-kun was going to  great lengths to keep close to Akane, putting her between him and Ranma. Ukyo  caught the look of irritation on Akane's face, as she turned and pounded him  down for brushing up against her. "Stop that, you pervert!"</p><p><i>Very interesting, </i>Ukyo revised.</p><p><i>That was too close, </i>Akane cringed, controlling her breathing.</p><p>They had  to cut the discussion short as the teacher entered and the final bell rang.  Rushing to their desks, they watched the teacher goggle over the addition of  Ranma's clones to the class. Once again, Ranma had to explain their presence,  insisting that it was important for him to keep an eye on them. Given Ranma's  reputation at school, Miss Hinako agreed with this whole heartedly. Fortunately  for everyone else, the instant she began instruction, all three Ranmas promptly  nodded off on their desks.</p><p>Across  the room from Akane, Ukyo studied the situation with subdued enthusiasm.  Copy-kun had done something humiliating to Ranchan, and now Akane had attached  herself to him, allegedly as a chaperone to keep him away from the other  double. Ukyo was skeptical, though. It was not hard to imagine Akane giving Ranchan  the old heave-ho in favor of an all male version. Ukyo still found the curse  fascinating, but Akane had made her distaste for her betrothed's condition  painfully clear. It would not do to jump to any conclusions, but she was going  to keep a sharp eye on all of them. She was not going to miss an opportunity to  claim Ranchan for herself, once and for all!</p><p>As class subjects changed, and new teachers cycled  through the room, Ranma had to be roused to repeat his explanation for them.  Many of them were more strict about students paying attention, so Ranma and his  copies had to endure a few grueling hours of boredom. Copy-chan was already  familiar with the environment, but Copy-kun was awash with confusion, and kept  passing notes to Akane. The subjects were all benign at first, asking her to  explain the layout of the school, where bathrooms and such were, when they  would be allowed to eat. Some of the questions were inspired by the  between-class conversations he overheard, such as, was it true that she was engaged  to Ranma, did they love each other, did they practice making love. Akane did  her best to restrain herself from making any outbursts in class, but her face  took on a deeper shade of rage and embarrassment as the notes progressed. Ukyo  made what she would of that, a grin growing by the hour.</p><p>From  observing the other couple, Ukyo noted that Copy-chan rushed over to talk to  Hiroshi and Daisuke between classes. The three of them huddled, talking in  hushed excitement. Ranma kept an eye on her from a distance, but showed no  signs of interest in what she was discussing with the pair of perverts. From  the rumors she had heard, Ranma had spent the past week trying to keep her away  from anything male. Apparently, he had eased off a bit; distanced himself from her.  Watching him, alone at his desk, she noticed that his face occasionally took on  a strangely vulnerable expression. At those times, he would glance over at  Akane and Copy-kun, and look positively wounded, before snapping his attention  away.</p><p>Ukyo  licked her lips. There was definitely something going on. If the part of the  rumors about the mirror clone chasing anything of the opposite sex were true,  and this boy was just as bad as the girl, there was a good chance that he had  started putting the moves on Akane. Somewhat successfully too, if the blushing,  squirming, and diminished temper (for Akane) were anything to go by. Combined  with that lost look on Ranma's face, it seemed a sure thing that his un-cute  fiancée had shifted her affections to his double.</p><p>It was  definitely time to test the waters.</p><p>At the  next class break, the last before lunch, Ukyo made her way over to Ranma's  desk. Akane did not notice. She had dragged Copy-kun into a corner where they  were having a heated discussion under their breaths. Perfect. Ukyo propped  herself against Ranma's desk and looked into his eyes. "What's the matter,  Ranchan? You're lookin' a little down," she gave him a friendly, concerned  smile.</p><p>Ranma's  eyes flinched away. His mind had been wandering over the scene in the bath,  noticing things he had missed at the time. His habit of reviewing battles was  torturing him, as it forced him to consider what could have happened as well as  what had happened. His denial did not extend so far that he failed to  comprehend the differences between a penis and a vagina. His friendship with  Hiroshi and Daisuke also ensured that he knew that the perverts thought  sticking one in the other was the pinnacle of their raunchy dreams. Failing to  understand <i>why</i> anyone would want to do such a  thing to a girl did not protect him from the realization that Copy-kun almost <i>had</i> done that to him. The horror of it had shown in  his eyes when Ukyo looked at him.</p><p>Ukyo's  eyes widened as Ranma visibly paled. "Ranchan?"</p><p>"Sorry,  Ukyo. My mind was on somethin' else."</p><p>"Are you  alright, sugar?"</p><p>"Yeah.  Fine. What's up? What did you want to talk about?" Ranma collected his wits and  composed his features. He was glad of the distraction, since it kept his mind from  wandering down a dark and dangerous path, opening doors that were better kept  sealed.</p><p>"I can  see these copies are making your life miserable. I thought, maybe it would help  to talk about what's going on. You know, with a friend?" she smiled, putting a  hand on his. Ranma looked a little surprised, then shook his head and smiled  back.</p><p>"Thanks,  Ucchan, but I don't feel much like talkin' about it right now."</p><p>Ukyo was  not going to be brushed off that easy. If she could get him to open up, if she  could exploit that vulnerability she was seeing, she could win him away from  Akane completely. "It sounds like Copy-kun and Akane did some really bad things  to you. It's not good to keep things like that to yourself," she pressed. To  her surprise, Ranma twitched in pain at her words.</p><p>"A…  Akane didn't do nothin' to me!"</p><p>"It's  not what she did, so much as how she's reacting to all this. I can see you're  upset about it. Come on, Ranchan, you don't have to hide these things from me,"  she squeezed his hand reassuringly.</p><p>"Yeah,  Akane's acted a little weird about all this, but… That's not really surprising.  She always reacts badly to stuff I say and do," Ranma admitted. While this was  true of just about everyone, it was always worst with Akane.</p><p>"Are you  afraid I'll over react if you tell me what happened this morning?"</p><p>Ranma  nodded.</p><p>Ukyo  sighed and shook her head. She leaned forward and slipped her arms around him,  hugging him tight. "I made the mistake of hating you for something you didn't  do once. I'm not going to do that again if I can help it, Ranchan," she  whispered. It was the most touching and comforting overture anyone had ever  made to the troubled boy. He relaxed in her arms, and returned the hug, daring  to think he could confide in someone at last.</p><p>"What  the hell do you think you're doing!" Akane screamed, flying across the room  and dropping on Ranma like a jack hammer. Ukyo barely recoiled fast enough to  avoid the blow. She growled at the sight of Akane's jealous temper. Obviously,  her affections had not strayed far enough.</p><p>Ranma  clawed his way up from the shattered remains of his desk and shouted into  Akane's face, "Baka kawaiikune! That hurt! What did I do to you!"</p><p>"Oh,  like you don't know!"</p><p>"Yeah! I  don't know! I wasn't doin' anything!"</p><p>"Jerk!  Do you think I am blind!"</p><p>"I don't  know what your problem is, you violent tom-boy!"</p><p>*Wham!*</p><p>"Ite!"  Ranma pulled himself up again, "See! There you go again!"</p><p>"Everyone!  Come here! Ranma and Akane are having a lover's quarrel!"</p><p>"Do they  look like lovers to you?"</p><p>"Now see  what you started!" Akane fumed, blazing red.</p><p>"What I  started! You jumped on me!"</p><p>"I did  not! How dare you say that! Jerk!"</p><p>*B-thwam!*</p><p>"That  does it! You leave Ranchan alone!"</p><p>"You  stay out of this, spatula-girl!"</p><p>"Hey!  Don't talk to Ucchan like that!"</p><p>While  Ranma, Ukyo and Akane faced off in a three way shouting match, Copy-chan looked  over at Copy-kun, and the two of them inched their way out of the room.</p><p>From the door, Copy-chan and Copy-kun watched the  argument raging in the classroom. They were starting to understand the danger  of being a Ranma shaped target around angry people. As they listened to Ranma  insulting Akane, Akane clobbering Ranma, and Ukyo accusing Akane of two timing  Ranchan with Copy-kun, they considered retreating even further. The instant  that Akane, in the heat of rage, let slip that Ranma had been the one "two  timing with Copy-kun", they turned heel and sprinted away. The sound of Ukyo  exploding could be heard throughout the school, echoed by the astounded voices  of the rest of the class. Their feet took them through the school and out onto  the grounds, where they stopped and turned to each other.</p><p>"That  was insane," Copy-kun commented.</p><p>Copy-chan  nodded and leaned against him. "I hope they don't blame us for getting' the  hell out of there," she sighed. She dropped cross-legged onto the grass, and  Copy-kun joined her. Her mind quickly went through the limitations that Ranma  had set on them and reached some conclusions she shared with him. "Well, the  only reason for splitting us up is to keep us out of trouble. If the trouble  starts with them, we sort of have to turn to each other to stay out of trouble.  Ranma isn't here, so there's no chance of one of us doin' anything with him. I  think we're safe at the moment."</p><p>"Uh,  sure. That makes sense."</p><p>"So.  What do you wanna do?"</p><p>"Um.  Well, I've figured out some new things about making love. We could talk about  that. I mean, talkin' is okay, right?"</p><p>"Sure.  Me too," she smiled, and began to share her conversations with Hiroshi and  Daisuke with him. She had sat down with the two of them and outlined her  interesting in learning how to make love, and asked them to explain how it all  worked. They enthusiastically began to describe a list of mating practices and  rituals, explaining that there were some steps that came before actually making  love. First, there was dating, which let a boy and a girl get to know each  other. Then there was flirting and making out, which helped them figure out if  they liked each other. If they liked each other, they moved on to heavy  petting. This allowed them to become familiar with each other's bodies and felt  awful good!</p><p>"Now  they also said that making out and heavy petting are also part of making love.  They called it foreplay," she explained, as she went on to sharing the details  of these techniques with him.</p><p>"Oh.  That's a lot more than I figured out," he confessed. He went on to explain the  part he had stumbled onto, and which Nabiki had clued him in on. She sat there  wide eyes as he explained how male and female bodies fit together, and that  doing that, according to Nabiki, was making love.</p><p>"Wow. I  guess that explains why a girl needs a boy to make love properly. Nice to know  there's an actual reason, and not just some arbitrary rule," she mused  thoughtfully. Sighing, she looked at him. "Well, it's no wonder we were doing  so badly. We totally skipped dating and flirting. Making out is hugging and  kissing, so we missed out on the first steps."</p><p>"That's  sort of good news, too," Copy-kun observed. "I mean, a lot of that stuff goes  on in making love, but you can do all that without actually making love. That  means we can actually practice most of it without anyone getting upset." He  smiled and looked pleased.</p><p>"What do  you mean?"</p><p>"Well,  when Nabiki was questioning me, she was most concerned with finding out if I  had made love with Ranma. She figured out that I was not sure what that meant,  so she asked a lot of questions until she figured out that I never actually…"  he searched for the word she had used. "Oh, that's it. I never actually  penetrated Ranma. Once they heard that, they all relaxed and Nabiki told me  that I had not made love with her… uh, him. Whatever."</p><p>Copy-chan  raised her eyebrows and considered that. "Well," she tilted her head, "that's  good news then. Maybe we can start dating and flirting then. I suppose we'll  have to get someone to come along and make sure we don't get in trouble."</p><p>"I am  sure if we explain what we are doing, they won't get so upset."</p><p>"Um.  There is one problem though."</p><p>"What's  that?"</p><p>"From  what Hiro and Dai said, what we're doing right now is a lot like dating," she  explained. Dating, according to them, was essentially going somewhere nice,  like a movie, a restaurant or a park, with a member of the opposite sex and  talking about things. Ideally, talking about doing more things together, and  talking about each other. "I mean, we're both so new, it doesn't take much to  get to know each other. We know as much about each other as we do about our selves,"  she pointed out.</p><p>"Oh.  Well, we're not causing any trouble. Maybe we should work on flirting then,  since we're already dating?"</p><p>"That's  a good idea!"</p><p>Looking  at each other, beaming smiles, they were suddenly stumped.</p><p>"Uh.  They really didn't explain much about flirting," she admitted.</p><p>The two  of them suddenly looked crestfallen. How were they ever going to get good at  this?</p><p>"Wait,  since flirting helps us figure out if we like each other… If we already like  each other, maybe we don't have to worry about flirting," Copy-kun suggested.  They started smiling at each other again. "So, what did you say the next part  was?"</p><p>"Well,  if flirting is going well, and I suppose that means if you like each other, the  next thing is making out," she stated practically. "Cool. We're back to where  we were before! I have to tell you, I think I really like the making out part!"</p><p>"Oh, me  too. Even with Ranma it was nice!"</p><p>*Bonk!*</p><p>"Ite! I  didn't mean nothin' by it. Besides, Ranma doesn't like me, so it didn't work  out all that well in the end."</p><p>"Hmmmph!  Do you like Ranma!"</p><p>"Uh.  Never really thought about it. I like Ranma a lot better as a girl, that's for  sure!"</p><p>*Bonk!*</p><p>"Stop  that! I didn't say I liked Ranma like I like you! I like Ranma because I like you,"  he babbled.</p><p>"Well,  you're gonna get us both killed if you keep on liking Ranma so much. I suppose  I could make the same mistake, so let's agree to make sure neither of us are  Ranma before we do anything, alright?"</p><p>"Good  idea. I'm not Ranma."</p><p>"Me either."</p><p>"Can we  make out now?"</p><p>"Oh  yeah!"</p><p>When the teacher came in to start the next class,  Ranma, Akane and Ukyo stopped fighting and looked around. Copy-chan and  Copy-kun were nowhere in sight. They began to turn the room upside down in  search of the clones, and the teacher threw a fit. The three were sent to stand  in the hall, a bucket of water in each hand. The moment the door shut behind  them, they dropped the buckets and began to search through the school. Seeing  the panic in Ranma and Akane's eyes, Ukyo had come along to find out what the  pair were so worried about.</p><p>It did  not take long for them to check all the restrooms and storage rooms, working  together.</p><p>"Why is  it so important to keep tabs on those two?" Ukyo wondered.</p><p>"Did you  hear what we were saying about them earlier?"</p><p>"You  keep circling around that part."</p><p>"Don't  remind me," Ranma shuddered.</p><p>"So,  what's the big deal?"</p><p>"The big  deal is that they're obsessed with each other," Akane frowned.</p><p>"Sounds  more like you two are obsessed with them," Ukyo glared at Ranma. She was still  in shock about what Akane had accused him of during the class break. Ranma had  shouted back that the copy had started… did… everything. Ukyo was burning to  know what he "did".</p><p>"I don't  want anything to do with either of them," Ranma complained, looking faintly  horrified. "I just want to keep them from getting me into trouble until we can  put them both back in the mirror."</p><p>"Me  too," Akane clenched her teeth.</p><p>"Alright.  Let's check outside then," Ukyo headed for the entrance.</p><p>As they  stepped out into the sunlight, they noticed the rigid form of Kuno. They  approached carefully, seeing the tension in his form. They were so intent on  him, they were almost upon him when they looked at what he was staring at.  Before them, basking in the glory of each other, were Copy-kun and Copy-chan.  They were not wrestling. Wrestling was not that much fun. Ukyo gaped in abject  astonishment. The couple was having as much fun as was possible for two bodies  with all their clothes on. Their limbs were tangled, their lips locked around  probing tongues. Ranma looked as stunned as Kuno, who happened upon this scene  while patrolling the grounds in search of his pig-tailed-goddess. Perhaps the  only reason he had not struck a blow, or moved a step, was the fact that the  two were obviously, deliriously happy, and Kuno's mind could not encompass such  a possibility.</p><p>Poor  Ranma was not much better off. His pig-tail rose straight in the air, he  clutched his head in his hands, opened his mouth to scream, and promptly keeled  over unconscious. Akane rushed to his side, finding him white as a ghost, and  covered her mouth in fright.</p><p>"Ranchan?"  Ukyo stared.</p><p>Akane  put her hand on his forehead and pulled it away quickly, shifting to his neck  to find his pulse. After a second, Akane clenched her fist and hammered it down  on his chest. Her fingers returned to his pulse and she sagged with relief.</p><p>"Is he  okay?"</p><p>"I'm  taking him to the nurse's office. You take care of those two."</p><p>"Uh,  sure," Ukyo frowned with worry as Akane picked Ranma up, throwing him over her  shoulder, and went back into the school. Turning to Kuno, she blew a breath  gently in his direction, and the kendoist toppled over. "What a bunch of drama  queens!" she shook her head and went over to the love birds. Taking the giant  spatula from the harness across her back, she took careful aim.</p><p>*Whonk-a-whonk!*</p><p>"Ite!"</p><p>"Kyaa!"</p><p>"What  was that for!" in unison.</p><p>Ukyo  squatted down in front of them. "You two just gave Ranchan a heart attack, or  something," she informed them. They shared a guilty, frightened look. "You two  aren't serious, are you?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I mean,  that was some impressive kissing going on there, but," Ukyo shook her head,  "You're not seriously in love, are you?"</p><p>"Uh.  Well, we just haven't gotten around to making love," Copy-chan informed her  seriously. "But we're workin' on it!" Even though they were beginning to puzzle  out the act of making love, they had not yet distinguished it as something  apart from the state of being in love. As far as they were concerned, the act  was a prerequisite.</p><p>Ukyo  tasted grass. Pulling her face off of the ground and dusting herself off, she  gaped, "Working on it!"</p><p>"Well,  it doesn't just happen, you know," Copy-chan glared.</p><p>"Except  that one time with Ranma… or was it two times?" Copy-kun murmured, before  correcting himself. "Well, almost, anyway."</p><p>Ukyo  willed her brains to return to the site of detonation, and raised her spatula  threateningly, "WHAAAAT!"</p><p>Copy-kun  waved his hands, "Hold on, hold on! I wasn't trying to make love with Ranma. I  thought he was her." He pointed at Copy-chan, who waved and smiled. "It was an  innocent mistake."</p><p>"You're  saying you ACCIDENTALLY made love to Ranchan!"</p><p>"Uh. No.  It was an accident, but we didn't actually make love!"</p><p>Ukyo  sagged in relief, "Thank the Kami!"</p><p>"We just  made out," Copy-kun added for clarification.</p><p>Ukyo  reared up amid a pillar of flames. The couple jumped up and backpedaled from  the raging battle aura she was putting out. While they could not understand why  she was so upset, they could certainly tell she was about ready to kill them.  Ranma's foot-in-mouth disease had been shared with them in all its glory. The  next few minutes were a blur of spatula dodging.</p><p>"I'm  gonna kill you!"</p><p>"Hey! I  didn't do anything!" Copy-chan wailed.</p><p>"I'll  make sure you never get a chance!"</p><p>"But I  only want to make love with her!" Copy-kun dodged behind Copy-chan and pushed  her forward for emphasis.</p><p>This  was, of course, the moment a leotard clad figure bounded into view, snapping  her ribbon to snare Ukyo. Her intended cry of, "Fear not, Ranma-sama, I shall  save you from these foul harridans," changed instantly to, "What treacherous  hold does that pig-tailed-tramp have over you, that you would utter such a horrible  lie!"</p><p>Ukyo  looked up, her arms pinned to her sides by the ribbon, and gasped, "Kodachi!  What are you doing here?" Appearances by Kuno's little sister did not come  lightly. Not when she was forced to bound halfway across Nerima, laughing like  a maniac, just to show up at Furinkan.</p><p>"I heard  a foul rumor that this red-headed demon had followed my darling Ranma-sama to  school, and would not stop harassing him!" Kodachi cried, snaking another  ribbon in Copy-chan's direction.</p><p>"Who  told you that?" the okonomiaki chef puzzled.</p><p>Kodachi  unerringly pointed out Kuno, laying in the grass, "Why, my deranged, dear,  elder brother."</p><p>"Why  would he do that?"</p><p>"Quite  simple. He had to inform me that we had won a bet!"</p><p>Everyone  stopped struggling and stared in confusion.</p><p>"Does  that make any sense to you?" Copy-kun asked Copy-chan.</p><p>Copy-chan  shook her head.</p>
