</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Twenty-Seven: The Art of Dating, Step Three:  Temptation</p><p>As the couple came closer  and closer to the Tendo Dojo, Ranma became gradually more agitated. Even though  preoccupied by other, private thoughts, Akane could sense the growing tension  in the boy beside her, as if it was passing through his hand into her. When it  first became noticeable, she had asked him what was wrong, but he had shook his  head and muttered that he had no idea. They had automatically begun to scan the  darkness beyond the street lights searching for some indication of attack, but  neither had a sharp sense of danger. It was more like a creeping dread, and it  did not take long to realize that it had something to do with what they faced  when they got home. Considering their situation, it was not hard to guess what  they could expect, coming home from a date together. With their fathers, it was  reasonable to expect to walk into a wedding ceremony. Ranma frowned in  incipient anger. That would absolutely ruin what had been the nicest date he  had ever been on with Akane. After brooding on it for several blocks, he made a  decision.</p><p>Akane turned to look at him in curiosity as he pulled  them both to a halt. She had caught the flash of anger, but as she faced him  there was only a serious look, a look he might go into battle with, but it  quickly faded into something more uncertain. "What is it, Ranma?"</p><p>"Akane," he began, then took a deep breath. "I've got a  bad feeling about going home. Something is going to happen to completely ruin  our night." The hard look of intent came back, with an undertone of anger, "I  am sick and tired of everything we do ending on a bad note."</p><p>"Well, if you don't want to come home, I guess I could  grab your gear and bring it over to Dr. Tofu's for you," she offered, in  puzzled concern. It bothered her that he seemed ready to ditch her, but knew  any difficulty with the fathers would be diminished if he did not return with  her.</p><p>"No, that's not it," he almost growled. "Akane, I usually  try to do the right thing, but sometimes I can't figure out what that is. For  once, it's different, 'cuz I do know the proper way to end a date. The problem  is, I don't want it to be taken for somethin' it's not."</p><p>Akane was suddenly feeling lost. The proper way to end a  date? Was he…? "Ranma? What… are you saying you want to kiss me?"</p><p>Ranma studied her carefully. The truth was, he did, but  he did not know how to admit that. Not when he was still uncertain how she  might take it. He swallowed and focused on her eyes, "It would be the right  thing to do, I mean, if this is supposed to be a real date. But… Do you want me  to?"</p><p>Akane stared back at him, seeing the uncertainty, the  anticipation, the dread of how she might respond. They had reached this point  before, and made the mistake of not making sure they had any privacy. If they  got any closer to home, they certainly would not, but here, now, there were no  witnesses. If anything, that was what convinced her he was serious. She found  herself clutching his hand and trying to keep her breathing slow and even. Did  she? Unable to say anything, she allowed herself to nod the tiniest bit.</p><p>Ranma felt his heart begin to race as he caught the faint  acknowledgement. His mouth suddenly feeling dry, he glanced away, letting his  face fall into shadow and licked his lips. From the corner of his eye, he saw  her do the same. It almost made him laugh. For once, he envied Copy-kun and his  fearless lust. With almost a hiccup of surprise, he realized that was a part of  him now, and to his chagrin, the pale copy of himself had even recorded the  procedure in his mind as a martial arts technique! What could be simpler for  the Great Ranma Saotome than to execute such a simple technique? Step One: Turn  toward your partner, look at her and let what you think and feel about her to  show on your face.</p><p>Akane found his attention on her again and looked up. She  almost gasped in surprise at his expression. She did not know what to make of  it, there was humor and fear underlying protective concern and wonder filled  with hunger and passion, and it was all beaming down on her. Her guard slipped  and Ranma watched as surprise, curiosity, awe and a touch of burning fever  filled her gaze. Suddenly, Step Two seemed easy. Tell her what you think. "You  really are cute when you smile, and when you're asleep. It's hard to see that  when we're fighting. I like seeing you laughing and happy more. I wish we could  be friends instead of fiancées, so I could tell you I like you without everyone  making a big fuss." He smiled, "You know, you're the only fiancée I think can  understand how I feel about all these engagements. You're the only one who  feels the same way. I guess that's why we get along so well."</p><p>Akane almost choked, "I'm not sure I'd call what we do,  getting along!"</p><p>Ranma chuckled, "Come on, Akane. I'm not used to being in  one place for so long, and I'm perfectly happy living on the road. Do you  really think I haveta stick around people I don't like living with? I don't  really understand why I make people so angry, 'cuz I know I'm not as bad as  Pops. You must like me a little, 'cuz you never seem to stay mad at me for  long. I'd say that means we get along pretty good."</p><p>"Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds?"</p><p>Ranma shrugged. Not sure if Step Two was going entirely  right, but seeing Akane was not actually mad at the moment, he proceeded to the  next step. He put his arms around her, slowly and gently, waiting to see how  she would react. To his surprise, she slipped easily into his arms, looking up  at him with her hands placed gently on his chest in curious anticipation. He  had one part of Step Two left to do, and he steeled his nerve as he found a way  to say, "This is going to sound crazy too, then. Akane." He looked deep into  her eyes, searching, watching and waiting to see how she reacted to the rest,  "If I was absolutely sure what it meant, I'd say I love you."</p><p>Akane felt herself struggling for air, even though his  gentle embrace in no way actually impaired her breathing. Those words were like  a fist in her gut, but the impact was disturbingly pleasant. She was well aware  of the qualifications in his statement. He more than liked her. "You… you mean,  you're not sure if what you feel is love?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "It's nothing like what those love  spells have made me feel, and I'm not sure that's what real love would feel  like. Those feelings would have made me kiss you already, but what I feel… I  want to kiss you, but I won't if you don't want to kiss me."</p><p>Akane reflected for a moment, and the thing that came to  mind was that part of what he felt for her was… Her eyes widened. Respect.  Rather than try to speak, she closed her eyes, leaned carefully forward and  gently touched her lips to his. It was all the encouragement he needed. In  moments, she was holding on to him as much as he was holding her, tentatively,  hopefully, gratefully. For the first time since the engagement was thrust on  them, some small corner in each of their minds wondered if it was really such a  bad idea.</p><p>Sanity returned and they both backed away. They met each  other's eyes, flushed with excitement and chagrin, then looked away at the same  time. The moment had been wonderful, but they recognized it as more of a  declaration of peace between them than a promise of things to come. For once,  they were able to end things on a good note. Whatever happened next would be  unable to taint what had just passed. One step forward. No steps back. It was  enough for both of them. So, they resumed walking home, preparing to face  whatever disaster was certainly waiting for them.</p><p>Of course, they were totally unprepared for the scene  awaiting them as they entered the dojo. The first alarm bell was being greeted  by Dr. Tofu instead of Kasumi. One look at his severe, concerned face assured  them that their recent date was the last thing on anyone's mind in the Tendo  Home. He approached with the demeanor of every doctor faced with the burden of  delivering bad news to a patient's family in the waiting room.</p><p>"Ranma. Akane," Tofu greeted them succinctly.</p><p>"Dr. Tofu?" they both gulped.</p><p>"Why don't the two of you come into the Tea Room and sit  down. I have something to tell you, and it will take a bit of explaining. I  must insist you hear me out before attempting anything rash."</p><p>"What's wrong? Is it Ranma-chan! Did something happen to  her!"</p><p>"Please, come sit down. I'll tell you everything we  know," he urged them, putting a hand on their shoulders and firmly steering  them in to where Genma and Soun were pacing around the table. They paused and  offered nods in greeting, but remained strangely silent and grim. The tension  in the young couple shot up to agonizing levels and they turned as one to Tofu  and pleaded.</p><p>"Please, Dr. Tofu, where is Ranma-chan?"</p><p>"Doc, at least tell me she's still alive!"</p><p>"Ranma-chan is still alive, Ranma," he offered a faint  smile. "However, something has happened to her and she is in some danger. That  is why it is essential you listen to me so you do not inadvertently do  something to harm her." The fact that he did not respond to Akane's question  made it clear that their ignorance was a threat to her, if they were to rush to  her side. The two sat down and listened carefully as Dr. Tofu explained what  had happened to Ranma-chan. After making sure they understood his concern about  triggering her curse, he led them upstairs to where she was laid out in the  guest room. Since Mousse's actions and intentions had been also explained, the  pair leveled withering glances on the master of hidden weapons when they  spotted him hovering behind Shampoo and Ukyo. However, since he was in the  middle of a discussion with Cologne, they ignored him and joined Kasumi and  Nabiki on the other side of Ranma-chan and looked down on her with concerned  faces. A moment later, Mousse stood up and left the room.</p><p>"I've sent Mousse to retrieve some books containing  information related to the Mirror of Broken Souls and the cursed man who  survived its influence," Cologne announced to the doctor, loud enough for  everyone else to hear. Tofu nodded, stiffly from the door. He had not entered,  and tried very hard not to glance at Kasumi.</p><p>"Has there been any other change in her condition?" he  asked.</p><p>Cologne shook her head. "No. The symptoms of shock all  cleared up earlier, but she remains in a deep trance. She is bleeding ki, but  not at a dangerous rate. I suspect that the barriers she erected today have  been relaxed a bit, but she is not as naked as she was this morning."</p><p>Ranma cleared his throat, "Is there anyway I can give her  more ki? Would that possibly help? I mean, right now she's got about two thirds  of a normal person's ki. The missing third might be keeping her in a healing  trance."</p><p>"I considered that, but you remember what I said would  happen to the reflections if she gained a full measure?" Cologne looked at him  sternly. "It would take half your remaining ki to bring her up to that level,  which would cut you and Ranko off leaving you with barely a third of the energy  you need to survive, Ranma." She sighed, "No, there's a steady flow at present.  She has more than enough ki to wake up if there is nothing else preventing  her."</p><p>"Is there any way to tell if Fa Shen might be winning the  battle for dominance?"</p><p>"I can only tell that there is currently no struggle of  wills going on. I could not guess which one might have triumphed, if indeed  they simply did not stop fighting altogether. I would suspect the latter, since  the victor would almost certainly rise to consciousness," Cologne returned to  the head of Ranma-chan's futon and looked down on her thoughtfully.</p><p>"You mean, they called a truce?" Akane looked at her.</p><p>"They would certainly have a lot to discuss if the  circumstances allowed for it," Cologne offered, sitting down and patting the  sleeping girl's head gently. "In the meantime, there are some things you should  be warned of as well," the matriarch focused on Ranma meaningfully. When she  had his attention, she proceeded to explain the concerns that had come up  regarding Fa Shen's presence in the reflections. Shampoo and Ukyo cut in from  time to time to emphasize their own concerns as well. An occasional probing  question from Nabiki ensured that the matter was covered in sufficient detail.  Ranma confided his own thoughts on the topic, stemming from his initial  confrontation with Fa Shen, and the things he had pondered during his date with  Akane.</p><p>"I wish there was some way to know if I am right," Ranma  concluded, after expressing his concerns about what would happen if Fa Shen was  the source of the additional ki, and the state of living death she or  Ranma-chan might have to endure depending on which one was conscious. "But, if  I am, Ranko and I wouldn't have the same problem. We're both on the edge of  this, while Ranma-chan and Fa Shen are tied together in the middle."</p><p>"So, another no win situation for Ran-chan," Ukyo  commented bitterly.</p><p>"I hope not, Ucchan," Ranma running his hands through his  hair in frustration. He crossed his arms and looked between her and Shampoo.  "It's pretty freaky that you two fighting over Ranma-chan woke Fa Shen up, when  your engagements might be the one thing that would keep Ranma-chan from just  handing everything over to Fa Shen."</p><p>Ukyo and Shampoo looked at him in surprise.</p><p>"I know she gave up the engagements along with being me,  but there's no way I can honor all three engagements," he pointed out. "Also,  since the two of us are the only ones who can be Ranma, unless Ranko decides to  go back to Jusenkyo, being split like this isn't a perfect solution. I'm not  interested in getting' married any more than ever, but, I would be okay with  splitting up the engagements if that let her go back to bein' normal."</p><p>"Shampoo like idea, is best Shampoo married to cursed  Ranma."</p><p>"I'm not gonna let you just take Ran-chan," Ukyo glared.</p><p>"Shampoo hear blah blah blah know this tune by heart.  Time Spatula Girl learn new song," Shampoo sniffed in disdain.</p><p>"Right now, she's not engaged to anyone," Ranma growled.</p><p>"It was just a suggestion," Akane pointed out.</p><p>"Right. If you fight over her, she might just decide it's  not worth the trouble to be me again!"</p><p>"If become Fa Shen, Shampoo have to claim you Airen and  kill Ranko. Shampoo no want have to do that," she retorted in a hurt tone.</p><p>"You don't want him for a husband?" Akane pointed at  Ranma.</p><p>"Stupid Kitchen Destroyer! Is good husband! No want kill  Ranko!"</p><p>"Oh. Well. Who would?" Akane subsided.</p><p>"I wish there was some way to separate her and Fa Shen."</p><p>"There might be," Cologne spoke up thoughtfully. "If we  can fix the three of you, make you all whole, Son-In Law."</p><p>"What?" everyone else chorused.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll tell you all, when I have it figured  out," she promised.</p><p>Everyone keeled over backwards.</p><p>Ranma slowly pulled himself back upright, then paused as  an idea came to him. "The mirror," he said to himself aloud. Everyone else  popped to their knees and stared at him.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"What was that, Son-In-Law?"</p><p>"I'm not your Son-In-Law," he narrowed his eyes at her,  and waved everyone off for a moment to think. Nodding his head, he looked up.  "It would depend on if Ranko and Ranma-chan agreed to it, but I think we could  use the mirror to separate Fa Shen from the rest of us."</p><p>"I don't see how, given what I know of the mirror,"  Cologne criticized.</p><p>"That's because you've never been through it."</p><p>"Well then, enlighten us."</p><p>Ranma nodded and jumped to his feet. As he paced back and  forth, he spelled out his idea. "The way I remember it, the mirror feels like a  doorway from my mind. I mean, if you've ever stared into a mirror, you can see  your reflection is thinking the same thing you are. You're really on one side  of the glass, but you completely control the person inside the mirror." That  made several of his audience boggle. "Never mind. Try it and you might get the  idea," he shuddered, remembering a time when he had studied his alternate form  in the mirror and been spooked by the perception of his thoughts and feelings  possessing her. "Anyway, I told Akane that when I was coming out of the mirror,  I expected to still be cursed Ranma even though I was walking out all-guy. It  was all in my mind until I crossed over. If I had not made the decision to come  out as a guy, the reflection would have stayed normal."</p><p>"You mean there was something different from when Ranko  was trapped in the mirror?"</p><p>"Yeah, because the curse was triggered, Copy-kun was put  back in my head, but I never triggered the curse while Copy-chan was in the  mirror, so she stayed in the mirror until I let her out," Ranma turned and  looked down at his original self. "I didn't have to bring back my guy side," he  shook his head. "It's done now, and the reasons are the same. However, it would  be easier for Ranma-chan and Ranko to be the same person again. Ranma-chan  would have a shot at being part of her family as Ranko, and Ranko would still  be able to be male when she wanted with the curse."</p><p>"If they went back to the mirror," Cologne was catching  on, "Ranko could go in, Ranma-chan could revert to male form, making them one  mind again, then go back to female form and let Fa Shen take that body and come  out of the mirror."</p><p>"Exactly," Ranma nodded with conviction.</p><p>"That would not completely fix the bleeding problem, but  it would certainly clear up the mess with Fa Shen," Cologne noted with  satisfaction. She returned her hand to Ranma-chan's head, smiled and gently  brushed her bangs out of her face. "Well, all we need is for you to wake up,  hopefully before your mother gets back, and make another trip out to that  mansion."</p><p>Nodoka returned to the  restaurant where Ranko and Ryouga were eating well before the two were finished  with their desserts. On the train, she had brooded over the girl's gentle  refusal of her offer to adopt her, but at the same time recognized that there  were advantages to assuming the role of mentor instead of a motherly role. For  one thing, it gave her a great deal of liberty in addressing the girl's  sexuality and education. As a mother, it would have been difficult to be frank  and honest about the chemistry she sensed between her young charges, but as a  woman and teacher, she could take an active hand in initiating the young girl  in the mysteries of womanhood. From their conversation in the ladies room, that  was certainly a priority. As a former tom-boy herself, she understood that  Ranko was far more adventurous than the average girl, and from her usual  appetites certain to live up to certain myths about red heads. Nodoka knew she  could not encourage her to indulge her curiosity with her new young man, so it  had seemed prudent to invest in something to distract her. From personal  experience, she knew a woman needed a "special friend" if she was determined  not to stray into some man's bed in spite of all good intentions. Thus, she  took advantage of the need to give the teens some privacy during their meal to  pick up a little gift for Ranko.</p><p>When she entered the restaurant and saw the pair sitting  on the same side of the table, polishing off a dessert and holding hands under  the table, she knew it had been wise not to wait until Ranko could accompany  her shopping for bedroom novelties. Taking a deep breath, and carefully masking  her motherly concern, she approached their table to see if they were ready to  go.</p><p>Ranko looked up as her mother approached and smiled.  "Auntie Nodoka! Where have you been?" she asked with sparkling eyes and a  flushed face, trying to hide some breed of mortification. Nodoka almost  grimaced, wondering if she had missed something important.</p><p>"I had a little errand to run," she responded, smiling  back. Noticing the wooden grin and glassy eyes of the boy beside Ranko, along  with what appeared to be blood stains on his tux and the table cloth where he  was sitting, Nodoka knew she had certainly missed something. She had heard of  girls who exploded into full bloom, but she suspected Ranko was entering this  new phase of her existence with the same unrestrained enthusiasm she did  everything else. Time to nip this in the bud, she decided. "If you'd care to  accompany me to the ladies' room, Ranko, I'll tell you all about it. Do you  mind, Ryouga?"</p><p>"Not at all, ma'am! We were just about ready to leave,  really!"</p><p>"Don't go anywhere, Ryouga. I'll be right back," Ranko  insisted.</p><p>The boy nodded and, as they left, heaved a great sigh of  relief. He needed to collect his wits and figure out if he was in heaven or if  he was in hell. He had seen the Ranma he knew, mixed with the Ranma of the koi  rod, the Copy-chan who opened his eyes to his feelings for Ranma, and this  strange person Ranma had become for his mother all blended together, and he had  not been prepared for her at all! Between a nose bleed and two naps on the  floor, he had to wonder if it was really safer to just fight the girl, because  he did not know if he would survive dating her. He did know this, though. He  was totally in love! The very idea almost scared him witless. The universe did  not hold his happiness in high regard, and he was terrified that somehow, some  way, this wondrous feeling invited disaster. He pulled the condom out of his  pocket, and fingered it thoughtfully. Quite clearly it represented a promise  beyond his wildest fantasies, but more importantly, it was a message. He had  succeeded in doing what he had set out to do. He had helped her come to terms with  her new life, her current identity. In spite of anything that had happened, or  anything that might yet happen, what he held in his hands was a symbol of  victory. Ryouga Hibiki had successfully accomplished something he had set out  to do. For the first time that he could remember, he felt a well of confidence  spring up inside him, a brilliant, uplifting sensation that spilled out of him  in a familiar glow.</p><p>He fought the urge to rush outside and let off his first  mokotakibisha.</p><p>While he basked in happiness, Ranko and Nodoka confirmed  that they were alone in the ladies room. Nodoka urged her to use one of the  stalls, informing her that she had spotted a dance club that was perfect for  the next activity of the evening. When Ranko emerged to wash her hands, she was  presented with Nodoka's gift.</p><p>"I know I said we would go shopping for one of these, but  it was simpler to find one now, since we're already in the city," Nodoka  grinned, seeing the shocked look on the girl's face when she opened the long,  narrow box. Ranko nervously pulled the cylindrical object out of its velvet  nest, running her fingers over the smooth, rounded surface. It was a little  shorter and more slender than what nature had graced her with as a boy, and in  spite of herself she looked a little disappointed. Nodoka laughed, "I can see  you expected something a little more… impressive. Trust me, this will be a lot  easier for you to deal with for starters." Her face became more serious and  concerned. "Ranko, I want you to know that I am concerned with your well being.  By giving you some means of protection, I am looking out for you, but I am not  encouraging you to do anything. Do you understand?"</p><p>Ranko looked up and nodded. "Is that why you bought me  this?"</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "It's perfectly understandable that you  would find yourself tempted by such a handsome young man, but let me ask you  this. Do you wish to be married to him?"</p><p>Ranko paused and bit her lip. Once again the hated  marriage question had come up, but after throttling her outright denial, she  considered the context of the question. "I'm not thinking that far ahead. I'm  just getting used to the idea that I love him. I never would have thought that  possible, but I do. And I want to prove it to him," she looked up, hoping her  expression would convey her meaning better.</p><p>Nodoka smiled and blinked sudden moisture out of her  eyes. She could see the girl's feelings naked on her face, and shook her head  faintly. "I am sure you do, and it's not my place to tell you what you can and  can't do. I will say that it would be wise to take this very slowly. You might  not feel the same way tomorrow, or a week from now."</p><p>"I've had these feelings a long time, but I couldn't let  myself see that," Ranko blurted. For an instant she felt a dread of something  going wrong, of things going back to how they were, or her mother learning who  she really was. She swallowed hard in sudden terror. She grabbed the woman's  hand and stared into her eyes, "You have to understand, no matter what, you  have to know none of this affected Ranma! I didn't… I couldn't let any of this  be blamed on him! He doesn't know!"</p><p>"Relax, Ranko-chan," Nodoka cupped her cheek.</p><p>"I'm not Ranma, Ranma's nothing like me, just… you have  to believe me!" she demanded quietly, holding herself tight in anxiety.</p><p>"Certainly not. I don't understand this curse, or how it  affects you two, but, I think I understand what you're concerned about," she  smiled gently. "You don't have to keep hiding from yourself because of how this  effects him. You are two different people, Ranko-chan."</p><p>"Yeah, well," she hung her head. "There have been times  when it didn't seem that way. I wish I could explain it, but I'm too afraid you  will think I've ruined him," she quickly brushed her cheek, blinking hard, and  struggled to keep from hyperventilating. She was coming so close to revealing  the truth, damning Ranma. She wanted to throw up. Before she could say any  more, her chin was taken in a firm grip and she was forced to meet her mother's  eyes.</p><p>"Ranko," the voice was stern, but the eyes holding her  gaze were compassionate. "As I get to know you, I know who to look past to see  my son. I don't see how you could help but make him a better person. I can't  promise I will approve of him, but I will judge him solely for who he is. Do  you understand?"</p><p>"I… I don't know. I can try," she offered.</p><p>"As can I," Nodoka smiled. "Now, put that in your purse.  I would suggest you keep that in mind as an alternative to rushing into  something you are not prepared for, just because it would feel good. If you are  seriously thinking of becoming more intimate with Ryouga, I suggest you find  out if he's ready to take that step himself. He seems to be a rather shy and  insecure boy, and it might not be the best thing for him to pursue this too  quickly."</p><p>"I… um… I sorta already, um, promised…" she babbled.</p><p>"What did you say exactly?"</p><p>"That I was willing to… ah…"</p><p>"Ah! Well, if that's all, then I suggest you leave it  be," Nodoka suggested, patting the girl on the shoulder. "You've made your  intentions clear enough, so I would leave it up to him to figure out if he's up  to it."</p><p>"Um. You don't know Ryouga," she blushed. "He can get  really carried away when he gets excited about something. I'm surprised he  didn't just blow up on the spot!"</p><p>"Erm. Ranko-chan, dear," she tried not to laugh, "Unless  you want to give the poor boy a heart attack or a stroke, I would suggest that  you definitely take things very slowly. He sounds like a high strung young man.  You need to gradually build up to things with him, one step at a time, or he  will be completely useless. Besides, you might enjoy the whole thing much more  yourself that way. Think of it as building discipline."</p><p>Ranko nodded, putting the vibrator away and quickly  making sure she was presentable, before following Nodoka back to the table and  Ryouga. The three quickly settled the bill and walked outside to hear Nodoka's  plan for them to go dancing. Ranko and Ryouga blushed and stammered that they  did not actually know how to dance, and confessed to having little interest in  the activity. Hearing that, Nodoka commented idly that dancing was not too far  from their favorite activity. Dancing could be looked at as a kind of kata for  couples, with no particular emphasis on combat, it did have techniques and  varying levels of complexity and difficulty. Ranko and Ryouga exchanged odd  looks. It was not hard to relate this to their experience with pair skating. It  should be easy to pick up if they saw anyone who was any good at dancing, they  agreed aloud. Nodoka led them to the club and left them to observe the other  dancers while she sought out a phone. She made a quick call to the dojo,  intending to inform everyone that they would be returning rather late, since  the date was going so well. After many long rings, Nabiki answered, and took  the message with enthusiasm.</p><p>"Don't worry Auntie Nodoka, you three stay out as long as  you like!"</p><p>"We will probably catch the last train home, Nabiki. I  suppose I can wait until tomorrow morning to speak to my son," she sighed,  shaking her head wearily.</p><p>"Oh, I am so sorry," Nabiki apologized sincerely. "As much  as he wants to see you, he won't be home tonight. There has been a crisis with one  of Ranma's friends, who has a life threatening condition. Ranma has been doing  everything he can to help out the past couple of days. He vowed at the start to  do whatever he could to keep his friend from dying. Ranma has a plan to find a  cure so they're leaving tonight. I don't know when he will be able to come  home."</p><p>Nodoka sighed. It was almost to be expected. "That's  okay, Nabiki. I did come to the dojo unannounced. I wouldn't want him to abandon  a sick friend for my convenience. I think it's very manly of him to be so  generous and helpful to those in need. We will simply have to make up for it  next time."</p><p>"I'll let him know. I am sure he'll be glad you  understand."</p><p>"Well, that's it I suppose. Goodnight."</p><p>"Wait," Nabiki interrupted. "Would it be possible to put  Ranko on the phone? This is a mutual friend of theirs, and I am sure she would  want to know what is going on."</p><p>"Um. She's not right with me at the moment. Is it  something I can tell her?" Nodoka inquired, craning her neck to see if she  could spot Ranko in the crowd across the room.</p><p>"Well, Dr. Tofu was treating the friend, and Ranko has  been working with Ranma to help out. She might know something important Ranma  missed, so it would be best if they could speak directly."</p><p>"Dr. Tofu? You mean he's there?"</p><p>"Oh, well, you know how it is, him and Kasumi…"</p><p>"I see. Hold on a moment."</p><p>A moment later Nodoka had found Ranko and brought her  back to the phone. Ranko suggested that Nodoka go keep an eye on Ryouga so he  did not wander off. When she retreated, Ranko cupped the phone and asked,  "What's going on, Nabiki?"</p><p>"It's Ranma-chan," Nabiki informed her, and went on to  quickly explain what had been happening while Ranko was on her date. Ranko  listened and grew paler and paler as she knotted the phone cord around her  fingers. After Nabiki filled her in, she put the doctor on to answer any  questions Ranko had Nabiki herself could not answer. Then, when she thought the  news could not get any worse, Ranma came on the line and proposed his plan to  her. As she hung up the phone her face was white as a sheet.</p><p>Ranma-chan and Fa Shen  wandered through the dreamscape they inhabited in growing alarm. To distract  themselves from the fear that they might not find a way to regain  consciousness, they continued to talk about their lives and the problems  waiting to be resolved when they awoke. However, their current dilemma  continued to creep up as the focus of their conversation, and occasionally  became grounds for argument. Fa Shen had proposed that, since they had stopped  fighting for dominance, there had to be something else blocking them.  Ranma-chan, highly conscious of how stripped her psyche was at the moment,  insisted there could not be anything in her psyche holding them down. Fa Shen  resented the implication that she was unconsciously hindering them. Before  their argument erupted into insults and blows, they stumbled across something  that almost sent Ranma-chan screaming for cover.</p><p>"Mrrrow?"</p><p>"C-c-c-CAAAT!" Ranma-chan stared at the curious black  tom. The cat, awakened from its nap by the shouting girls and wandering out of  hiding to investigate, stared back at her. Fa Shen stared at both of them.  Apart from the initial shocked utterance, Ranko showed no extraordinary fear,  and was rather stunned by the absence. Fa Shen shrugged and crouched to beckon  the cat closer. The tom shifted his attention from the human statue to her  affectionately cooing twin and inched forward to sniff at her outstretched  hand. When the cat finally deigned to allow Fa Shen to pet it, Ranma-chan  resumed breathing and frowned. "I don't get it."</p><p>"You mean, why aren't you afraid of this cat?"</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma-chan nodded. "Not that I'm complainin' but,  it's been a long time since I could look at one and not freak out completely,  at least on the inside." She scratched the back of her head.</p><p>"Isn't it obvious?" Fa Shen met her twin's eyes. One look  told her she needed to spell it out. "Well, think about it. Why would you be  afraid of yourself?"</p><p>"My… self…?" Ranma-chan's jaw dropped. She crouched down  to stare into the cat's eyes. The cat gazed back with oddly familiar grey eyes.  Apart from the feline pupils, they were the same color as Ranma-kun's eyes. The  cat yawned hugely as Ranma-chan gaped at Fa Shen, "Ohmigod. It's my neko-ken."</p><p>"Well, your cat personality," Fa Shen nodded.</p><p>"What's it doin' here?"</p><p>"I don't know. Maybe that means we're buried as deeply as  you bury your fears," Fa Shen suggested. Then she stiffened and searched around  herself. In a nervous voice, she asked, trying to act casual, "So, uh, is there  anything else you're scared of you might wanna tell me about before we, um,  meet it?"</p><p>Ranma-chan shrugged. "I'm not really afraid of all that  much."</p><p>"You're kidding," Fa Shen narrowed her eyes.</p><p>"Well, I suppose things scare me, like Akane's temper,  but it's not like she terrifies me," Ranma-chan snorted. Seeing that Fa Shen still  looked disturbed, she arched an eyebrow. "Is there something you wanna tell  me?"</p><p>"Yeah, we really need to wake up. You don't wanna meet  what I'm afraid of," Fa Shen warned in a very serious tone. She picked up the  cat and the two of them resumed walking. At the moment, they were passing  through what appeared to be the wilderness of the China. There was a faint  sound of something massive pushing through the forest, and Fa Shen grabbed  Ranma-chan's hand and began sprinting away from the sound. Ranma-chan peered  back as she stumbled along to keep pace, and gasped at what exploded into the  clearing they had just abandoned. It was big. Big enough to swallow her whole,  though the saber-like teeth could have minced her into tiny pieces well before  that stage. Ranma-chan stared into the burning yellow eyes that dominated the  red scaled, armored face, and gulped.</p><p>"Fa Shen?" she asked in a tiny voice, as the distance  between them and the giant predator widened. "Is there a, ah, undefeatable  martial arts technique you learned by being thrown into a pit of starving  dragons?"</p><p>"Nope. It was just a starving dragon, and if you'd been  swallowed by one, you'd be phobic too," Fa Shen retorted in a clipped voice.</p><p>"Do you…?"</p><p>"I don't even want to know," Fa Shen was pretty sure she  did not become a dragon to escape her fear. "But, if I did, it would explain  why that idiot, Ergot, was always so hot for me!"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Ergot, dragon prince of the Musk. I don't remember the  first time we met, because I was a bit out of my mind after crawling out of a  dragon's throat, but he challenged me relentlessly after that," Fa Shen  clarified, before stumbling to a halt. Ranma-chan stared at her, wondering what  could make her stand her ground with the embodiment of her fear just around the  bend. Then she took a good look at where they were.</p><p>"Heh, back where we started," she quipped, staring at the  familiar mist filled, spring riddled valley. Even with all the cats in China on  her heels, Ranma-chan would pause before racing through that place to get away.  The pair carefully began to skirt the area, when a thought came to Ranma-chan.  "Wait. If this is where we arrived, maybe the way out is here too."</p><p>"Seems reasonable. Do you remember exactly where we  arrived?"</p><p>Ranma-chan winced. She certainly did. She quickly led the  way. In a moment they were both standing beside the nyanniichaun. "It kinda  makes sense. This is where you ended and where I, well, who I am now, began,"  Ranma-chan muttered, leaning forward to carefully peer into the water. To her  surprise, there was a shadowy form submerged in the spring. "Hey. Who's that?"  she reared back in surprise.</p><p>Fa Shen edged forward and knelt by the spring for a  closer look. "It's a boy," she commented. She carefully set the black cat down.  It padded forward to paw at the water, then decided not to drink and wandered  into some tall grass carpeting the left bank of the spring. Fa Shen stood up  and paced around until she found a long bamboo pole laying hidden deeper in the  waist high grass. With practiced ease, she dipped one end in to fish out the  body they had found, idly commenting, "I've heard of people with skeletons in  their closet, but a drowned corpse?" She laughed and with a grunt flipped the  boy out of the water. To both their surprise, the figure coughed up a lung full  of water and curled up on his side. Even more shocking, they got a good look at  his face.</p><p>"Hey! That's me!" Ranma-chan shouted, kneeling at his  side.</p><p>"That's odd. Does this mean you are afraid of yourself?"</p><p>"Don't be ridiculous!" She grabbed his shoulder and shook  him.</p><p>The boy ignored her, eyes tightly closed as he repeated  over and over, "This can't be happening."</p><p>"What can't be happening?" the girls asked.</p><p>He blinked his eyes open and looked around in fear and  confusion. Cautiously, he peered at them and shook his head to clear it. With a  blush of embarrassment, he sighed. "It must have been a dream. Thank the Kami!"</p><p>The girls exchanged confused looks. "A dream?"</p><p>"Yeah. Uh, it's kinda weird, but I don't see him… it…  whatever. So it had to have been a dream," he was still looking around. When he  gave them a description of Genma and asked if they had seen him, an alarmed  suspicion crossed Ranma-chan's face. He was still talking, "He's my old man. We  came here to do some training. I musta got blindsided or somethin' 'cuz I  coulda sworn my old man turned into a panda before he knocked me into that  spring."</p><p>"You're kidding, right?"</p><p>"I told you it was crazy," he groused, standing up. "Huh.  That guide's gone too. Stupid old man, leavin' me knocked out in a pond and  runnin' off to stuff his face or somethin'!"</p><p>"Is this… am I seeing this right?" Fa Shen asked  nervously.</p><p>"Hey. Do you know who you are and where you are?"  Ranma-chan asked in trepidation.</p><p>"Sure. Ranma Saotome," he puffed up proudly, "Heir to the  Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts. Oh, I guess I should thank you or  somethin' for dragging me outta that spring."</p><p>"Is there something about that spring you're forgetting?"</p><p>"Huh? Supposed to be cursed or somethin' I guess. The  guide was goin' on about cursed springs. Called the place Jusenkyo. 'There over  one hundred spring here, each one have own tragic legend!' Shoulda known it'd  be some tourist trap and not a real training ground," he grumbled.</p><p>"It's not possible," Ranma-chan was beginning to  hyperventilate.</p><p>"This isn't just your guy side?" Fa Shen leaned toward  her.</p><p>Ranma-chan just shook her head, beginning to tremble as  the inconceivable began to take shape in her mind. Fa Shen noticed her eyes  beginning to glaze and frowned in sudden, intense thought. The boy claiming to  be Ranma looked at them oddly. He shrugged and was about to wander off when Fa  Shen caught hold of him. "Wait. There's some things you don't know. You don't  want to wander off in here."</p><p>"'In' here? We're outdoors. What are you talkin' about?"</p><p>"Oh, this is not good!" Fa Shen began to sweat, staring  at Ranma-chan as something crept back into her mind. At the clinic, after her  battle with Ranma, she had been informed of and finally remembered her death.  There had been a sense that something had happened between that moment and her  awakening in Ranma-chan. She had instinctively avoided it, but it suddenly played  out now. It was a haunting, timeless memory of a dark, cold place barely  illuminated by a distant, alluring light. She had been trapped and tormented by  flickering shadows of countless beings. She had initially fought the shadows,  trying to defeat them and break free of her prison. Again and again, she had  lost these battles, feeling a tiny piece of her essence torn away each time  before the shadows vanished. She learned to avoid the shadows, ignore their  intrusions, and wait for a special kind with a certain feel, a certain  vulnerability. These planned ambushes also resulted in more pain and loss, but  finally, after what seemed an eternity, she found the perfect one, and charged  into battle. For the first time, the shadow was pressed back to reveal a face.  A face she had recognized as that of her nemesis, Lo Shen. She had attacked him  instantly, with renewed rage, their ki spilling over each other and blending  before the pair of them sank into oblivion. "He's Ranma," Fa Shen gasped.</p><p>"I can see that, Fa Shen!" Ranma-chan growled.</p><p>"Do I know you two?" Ranma squinted, trying to place  their faces. He had just introduced himself, but they talked as if they were  already familiar with him. Also, there was a nagging sense of familiarity about  them. An unlikely family resemblance that disturbed him, since apart from his  father, he really did not know much about his family. His scrutiny went  unnoticed as they continued to argue, however.</p><p>"You don't understand. When he fell into the spring, I  attacked him. We dragged each other down here," Fa Shen shouted.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I don't remember fighting you. I don't fight girls."</p><p>"Shut up!" the two girls roared at him.</p><p>"Sheesh. Stupid girls."</p><p>"No," Ranma-chan shook her head as her initial suspicion  was confirmed. "That's not possible. I am Ranma." The boy stared at her in  disbelief and then started laughing. "How can that be possible!" she ignored  Ranma and grabbed Fa Shen, shaking her roughly.</p><p>"You know what you said, about how this is where I ended  and you began? You were exactly right," Fa Shen grabbed Ranma-chan and forced  her to stop shaking her. The confusion her words caused was more effective.  "Think about it. When he fell in, I jumped him. Male ki, female ki, it all  blended together, because we have the same soul, but neither of us could  control the whole so a new person, a 'whole' person formed and took control of  it."</p><p>"What the hell are you two talkin' about?"</p><p>"When we figure that out, we'll tell you," Fa Shen snapped.  She took Ranma-chan carefully into her arms, sensing she was too shocked to  deal with the possibility. She wondered if it could possibly be true. Then she  remembered what her mother had tried to make her do.</p><p>About a year before she died, her mom had taken her to  Jusenkyo and tried to get her to jump into the nanniichaun. It had something to  do with tapping into her full potential, her mother's animal heritage,  something that could be unlocked by mastering the powers of a curse, like the  traditional masters of the Shokei Fist, and mastered by embracing her  masculinity. Because she had not been willing to do it, her mother had refused  to reveal the mystery of her origins. All she did know was that if she had  accepted the curse it would have been some kind of catalyst. The combination of  male and female ki would supposedly have spawned a new version of herself  capable of achieving her full potential. She leaned the other girl's head on  her shoulder and whispered this story into her ear. "That's the real reason why  you have the ki of two people, because you took mine and Ranma's and made it  yours," she concluded.</p><p>"But, if I'm not Ranma, who the hell am I?" she wailed.</p><p>"You already told me. You are YOU," Fa Shen asserted.</p><p>"Why did I think I was Ranma?" she was looking for loop  holes.</p><p>"I don't know. Maybe because he was awake when you were  created, you just grabbed everything in his mind. You might have grabbed all of  my memories at the same time, but our personalities weren't compatible, so you  suppressed all of my memories," Fa Shen guessed, finding it easy to imagine  that happening. Meanwhile, Ranma was listening to the two of them and getting a  spooked and suspicious look on his face.</p><p>He swallowed and spoke up, "Now I know where I recognize  you from. You were in the pool. You attacked me," he accused Fa Shen angrily.  More of the memory returned, with it some disturbing information. With a  shudder, he added, "It felt like you did something to me, changed me into a…  a…" He stopped and patted himself down. "I'm still a guy. What happened? Was it  real? Did I really see Pop turn into a panda! Did I really turn into a girl!"</p><p>The two girls turned to him and Fa Shen sighed.  Ranma-chan was speechless. She stepped between the two and carefully explained  to Ranma what had happened. It took a while, because he refused to believe  until Ranma-chan woodenly began to parrot scenes from his life, in detail.  Then, to prove where they were, Fa Shen tracked down the tom cat and confronted  Ranma with it. Like Ranma-chan he expected to go into hysterics, but then he  realized the cat inspired no fear. With some difficulty, he accepted that this  was some kind of dream and openly wished he would wake up soon so he could look  for a cure, not relishing the idea that he would be turned into a girl whenever  he was splashed with cold water. When he was told that they had bigger problems  to solve before returning to China, he gasped.</p><p>"What do you mean, return to China! That's where I am,  isn't it?"</p><p>"We're in Japan, idiot. We came back about ten months  ago," Ranma-chan rolled her eyes. She wondered if he was even following the  conversation. With forced patience, she quickly outlined what had happened  since Ranma was cursed. "So, you see, we have to fix the problem caused by the  mirror. It would kill us to be that far from our reflections." Ranma seemed to  have stopped listening, distracted by the implications of all this  history.</p><p>"You stole a year of my life!" Ranma finally realized,  turning on Ranma-chan in anguish.</p><p>"She didn't steal anything, and you're not the only one  here who has had their life interrupted. Hell, you're lucky the two of us got  into a struggle that dragged us down like this, or you might have never been  woken up!"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"You don't remember any of the things she told you,  right? You wouldn't be able to bitch about it if we hadn't woken you up," Fa  Shen pointed out. "Now, you're in the same boat as we are. We need to wake up,  because it's entirely possible that we're all dying right now anyway!"</p><p>"Um," Ranma-chan paused thoughtfully. "It's possible we  only got trapped here because of him. Can either of you think of some way the  three of us can wake up?"</p><p>The cat mewed at the three of them, jumping from Fa  Shen's arms and heading away from the springs. Pausing at the head of a path,  it turned to stare at them. They all exchanged glances. The cat's tail flicked  impatiently as he yowled at them. Fa Shen shrugged, "Maybe he has an idea."</p><p>The two Ranmas shuddered, but followed Fa Shen as she  fell into step behind the cat. In a short while, the image of Jusenkyo vanished  to be replaced by a cliff overlooking a vast ocean of swirling clouds and fog.  The cat sat down on the edge of the precipice and began to clean himself.</p><p>"Well, this is helpful," the boy rolled his eyes.</p><p>"What do you make of it?" Fa Shen asked Ranma-chan.</p><p>She leaned out over the edge and frowned. "Leap of  faith?"</p><p>"You want us to jump offa here!"</p><p>"Seems as good as any other idea we've come up with."</p><p>Ranma-chan turned back around to face them, then froze.  "Uh, unless you prefer that!" she pointed, turned, and jumped off the cliff.  The other two gaped, then turned around. The dragon was slinking forward into  position to pounce on them. They looked at each other for a heart beat, then  raced to the edge of the cliff.</p>
