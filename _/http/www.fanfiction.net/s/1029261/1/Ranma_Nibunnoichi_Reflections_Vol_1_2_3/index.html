The ideas explored are  those of the author, and should not be construed to express the opinions or  intentions of the creator or associated agencies. </i></p><p><b>Author's  Note:</b> <i>I have been an avid fan of Ranma ½ manga, anime  and fan fiction for years. I am also a writer and artist. In spite of these two  things, I did not seriously consider creating any of my own fan fiction until  now. Before addressing the story I chose to write, I want to comment on why I  chose to write it. Over the past few years I have seen other fans take this  cast and explore a wonderful assortment of possibilities. Many excellent ideas  have been developed, and I felt I would have been walking in someone else's  shadow, or stepping on several people's toes, to explore the ideas inspired by  their additions to Ranma ½. Still, I had those ideas, and they  eventually led me back to the original series where I discovered an excellent  possibility I had not yet seen explored. In the original series, the conclusion  of the "Two Ranmas" storyline was left entirely to the imagination of  the readers. It was a perfect invitation for a fan fic, and offered me a  foundation for many volumes of ongoing fan fics. <b>Ranma Nibunnoichi -  Reflections</b> begins after Part 4 of Volume 35, and explores the events which  unfolded during the week when the Tendo Household was stuck with two amorous  copies of Ranma, one male and one female. </i></p><p><b>Revised  Author's Note: </b><i>The only changes to this documentapart from a  typo or twoare in the disclaimer area. A new, revised version of <b>Ranma  Nibunnoichi - Reflections</b> will be appearing under the heading of <b>Reflections  V.1 - Stuck in the Middle With You</b>. This story has been evolving from day  one. By the time I finished <b>Reflections,</b>  I had produced enough material for three complete volumes and the story was  still evolving in new directions. It had taken on a life of its own at some  point. I could not stop the ideas from spilling out. Before I knew it, it was  no longer the story I had intended to write. Nor was it the best story I could  have written. As I worked on the fourth volume, intended as a transition from  Ranma Nibunnoichi to Ranko Nibunnoichi, I realized it would become necessary to  go back and revise everything, taking advantage of things I learned in the  process of writing <b>Reflections</b> and  the "bonus" volume, <b>It's All in the </b><b>Reflexes.</b> Thanks to all of the reviews I received for both stories,  and the special efforts of Daniel Jess Gibson and Fangorn (Thanks guys!) that  process has begun. </i></p><p><i> In order to accommodate the growth  of the story and the writer, I need to update it a bit so that it can continue.  Some of the changes are simply structural. It will be a five volume story, each  volume having fifteen chapters. In the fifth volume you will find out why the  next story is called <b>Ranko Nibunnoichi - Refractions</b>. Sadly, that does  mean there will be noticeable changes. Some of the changes will be very subtle,  while others will be screamingly obvious. For example, the reflections will no  longer be identified as Copy-chan and Copy-kun. The suffixes -chan and -kun, by  which the copies were previously distinguished from each other, were not really  suitable. In Ranma's case, the same suffixes have developed into a tongue in  cheek way to emphasize which side of Ranma is being referred to, but that is  not a proper way to distinguish a boy from a girl. The -chan/-kun suffixes are  normally used to indicate a level of familiarity between two people regardless  of their gender. </i></p><p><i> I am sorry if this upsets some of  you. Feel free to stick with the version you like best. I will keep a copy of  the original version here, if allows it, and on my personal  site. For the most part, I am doing this revision for my own satisfaction. So  far, I have published a rough draft. What I want to create, what I hope you  will also appreciate, is a story that makes the most out of the ideas invested  in it. I hope to make it a little less confusing as well. Comments and  Criticism are welcome as always. This is still my first fan fic, after all. My  only request is that my readers offer examples or explanations to ensure that  their suggestions will enable me to improve the story.</i></p><p><b>Mature  Content: </b><i>Because <b>Reflections</b> was originally intended to  integrate with the series, before it evolved into an outright divergence, it  faced some obvious limitations, which many fan fic readers found disappointing.  On the surface, the situation screamed for a lovely lemon flavor. I have a  healthy (avid) interest in sex and sexuality, so it was not a case where I  couldn't or wouldn't go there… it was just that going there would have upset  the status quo tremendously. Now that <b>Reflections  </b>is no longer a "missing chapter" of the original series, the  ideas that support a lemon filling, can be explored. Part of the story deals  with sexual awakening and experimentation, and some of the plot hinges on  sexual events, and must be included in the R rated version. In some cases, the  fact that sex occurred is the only thing a lemon scene contributes to the plot,  and those scenes will be found only in the unrated version of the story. Even  those scenes have a value and significance beyond mere fan service, since the  way people act and interact in intimate circumstances is as important as how  they conduct themselves in other circumstances. </i></p><p>Part One: Three Ranmas?</p><p>The promise of spring hung in the air over Tokyo's  Nerima Ward. It was a warm day, for late winter, spiced by the scent of rain.  Naturally, the shower had lasted just long enough to catch the group out in the  open, as they trudged home from the train station. Now, only a few puddles and  damp spots in the shade remained. Everything else, including their clothes and  hair, had dried in the sun already. Akane sighed and glanced up to the side. It  was strange seeing Ranma, walking nonchalantly along the top of the fence,  unchanged by the freak down pour. It was even stranger that this sight was  accompanied by the familiar sound of Ranma-chan bickering behind her.  Especially since the same voice could be heard arguing with her.</p><p>"This  is really starting to creep me out," Akane muttered.</p><p>Her  mind flashed back to the scene in Mirror Mansion, as Ranma crashed into the  warded curtain and ripped the seal away from the cursed mirror, allowing  another clone to escape. Looking up to the side again she repeated her initial  comment. "Why did he have to be male?"</p><p>"What  are you starin' at?" the boy asked, catching her glaring up at him.</p><p>"Baka,"  she turned her head and kept on walking.</p><p>"Kawaikune!"  he muttered, turning to look at the red-headed girls walking hand in hand along  the fence top behind him. "What is that chunky, tom-boy's problem?" he asked in  confused annoyance.</p><p>Ranma-chan  looked at her twin, then back at the boy, and suppressed a shudder. Ranma and  Akane had gone to several lengths to keep the two clones separated during the  trip back to the dojo. From the moment they had laid eyes on each other, they  had been obsessively attracted to each other. Neither of them seemed to have  possessed a clue what to do with a lover, once found. The "throw yourself at  someone and kiss them" tactic Copy-chan had used the week before was almost  comical when doubled. It took them a while to stop lunging at each other and  banging heads. By the time they were on the train bound for Nerima, the pair  had impulsively progressed to hugging and kissing. The image of the two making  out in their seat on the train sent pains and chills shooting through  Ranma-chan's nervous system. "This is creeping me out too," she muttered under  her breath. Bending her head sternly, she pushed the boy forward, "Keep moving.  I need to get you to the dojo and out of sight before either of you get me into  any more trouble!"</p><p>The  boy allowed Ranma-chan to push him along the fence toward their destination. He  showed no discomfort or concern at backpedaling down the fence pole in front of  Ranma. He was somewhat disturbed that the boy who had let him out of the mirror  had turned into a perfect twin of the girl he had loved at first sight. This  prodding had been the first clue—since the startling transformation—of which  girl was which. Taking her free hand, as a means to keep track, he finally  raised the question that had been bothering him. "So. You gonna tell me why you  turned into a girl? Why you look like her?"</p><p>"Aw,  man! I told you I'd explain it all if you came with me to the dojo."</p><p>"You  said that before you… changed."</p><p>Ranma-chan  grit her teeth. "Whatever. Get this straight first. I don't look like her, she  looks like me! I was in this form the first time I looked in the mirror, and I  was a guy when I looked in it back there!" she growled, referring to Mirror  Mansion. "Both of you are copies of me," she asserted for the hundredth time.</p><p>The  boy tensed in alarm, "You don't mean…? Aw, man! I'm not going to turn out to  be a freak like you am I?" He twisted away in horror.</p><p>Ranma-chan  cringed and her face darkened with anger as Akane's voice trailed back to them,  "If you're so disgusted, WHY ARE YOU STILL HOLDING HIS HAND?" Akane kicked  the fence so hard it wavered under their feet and spilled all three of them  into the canal opposite the sidewalk. Ranma-chan plummeted toward the water in  resignation. Copy-chan betrayed only the slightest surprise, while "Copy-kun"  went into a full blown panic. The three plunged into the water and surfaced, spluttering  in shock at the cold, shouting in unison, "What didja do that for?" The boy  was patting himself on the chest in terror until Akane leaned over and stuck  out her tongue.</p><p>"Baka!  Didn't you notice that the rain had no effect on you?"</p><p>Before  the boy could answer, he was launched over the fence by a sleeper uppercut from  Ranma-chan. She had moved in an instant rage, wounded by the simple fact that  the boy was immune to her curse. Before she had stopped shaking in silent fury,  she was launched after him by her other clone.</p><p>"Go  pick on your own pervert!" the girl shouted as Ranma-chan crashed down in the  middle of the street. Akane's eye twitched ominously, as she stood frozen for  an instant. Copy-chan had started calling Akane "pervert-girl" when she had  been chasing after Ranma, and clearly did not intend to stop. While Akane  silently debated between maiming and murder, Copy-chan leapt over the fence,  went to her "lover's" side and cradled his head in her lap. "Hey! Are you  okay?"</p><p>Akane  lurched forward to pound the girl into the pavement, as Ranma-chan popped to  her feet and rushed forward to tackle the girl, moving neatly into position to  intercept Akane's elbow drop. Ranma was slammed down into her duplicates with  enough force to knock the air out of all of them. Despite the fact that  Copy-kun was proving to be just as annoying as Ranma, Akane had agreed to keep  the couple separated until they were all safe at the dojo. As they lay there  stunned, Akane grabbed the boy clone by the pig-tail and dragged him off  towards the Tendo Dojo. By the time the Ranma-chans had recovered, Akane was  dragging him around a corner. The girls stood up muttering a litany of  unflattering things about Akane and limped the last two blocks to the dojo.</p><p>Akane heard the two red-heads rushing to catch up  to her as she passed through the gates of the dojo. Tuning out their loud cries  for her to wait for them, she stalked up to the house. "Tadaima!" Akane  announced her return, dragging "Ranma-kun" into the genkan.</p><p>Kasumi  turned from watering a little bonsai tree, which sat on a narrow table in the  hall across from the front door, and took in the boy's disheveled, unconscious  state. One hand came up quickly to cover her mouth. "Oh my," she murmured  softly, before composing herself. "Okeirinasai, Akane-chan, Ranma-kun," she  smiled. Before she could ask about Ranma's condition, Soun and Genma burst into  the tiny entry loudly demanding a report.</p><p>"Oi!  Akane-kun!…"</p><p>"It's  about time, Boy!…"</p><p>"…Did  you get rid of that menace?" they chorused.</p><p>Taking  in Ranma's state, Genma hauled him to his feet, shaking him, "This is no time  to be napping, Boy! Tell me you've done your duty as a martial artist and sent  the evil back to where it came from!"</p><p>Akane  cleared her throat as the boy mumbled in semi-conscious confusion. "About  that…" she began.</p><p>At  that moment, Ranma-chan swept open the entry screen and leaned in with her  clone, "Akane! Wait! What are we going to tell…?" Everyone's eyes snapped to  the two redheaded girls in surprise, as Akane hung her head in embarrassment.  Ranma-chan recoiled in dismay.</p><p>"Well,  this is hardly a surprise," Nabiki commented, appearing in the hall behind Soun  and Genma. With a mischievous grin, she cleared her throat and said loudly,  "Will the REAL Ranma Saotome please stand up?"</p><p>Ranma-chan  immediately began sweating and waving her hands, "Wait, wait. I can explain  everything! It's not my fault!"</p><p>"And  we have a winner!" Nabiki smirked and watched as Soun and Genma loomed over the  panicking girl.</p><p>"RanMAAAA!  What is the meaning of this?" wailed Soun angrily.</p><p>"Foolish  Boy! How could you fail in such a simple task?"</p><p>Akane  grabbed Copy-chan and pushed her forward, clearing her throat, "Actually, um…  This is mostly her fault."</p><p>"Hey!"  the buxom red-head complained instantly, ignoring the fuming fathers to turn on  Akane. "You were the one who threw the fruit basket!"</p><p>"You!  You were the one who brought that damned compact along and tried to steal Ranma  with it!"</p><p>"What?  You mean you actually want him?"</p><p>"N…  No!" Akane blushed and growled, "That doesn't have anything to do with it! You  can't just kidnap people like that!"</p><p>"Oh,  what wonderful news, Saotome-kun! My little girl rescued your son from an evil  demon!"</p><p>"Who  are you callin' a demon?" the girl snarled at Soun. As Soun lurched back in  fright, he knocked the pitcher of water out of Kasumi's hand. It sailed  unnoticed overhead, seeking a suitable target, before coming down on Genma.</p><p>"Oh!  She's so SCARY!" Soun whimpered, cowering in the corner.</p><p>"Oh  my!" Kasumi finally interjected. "Maybe we should all sit down and discuss this  over tea?"</p><p>Ranma  and Akane marched the clones through the living room, and out onto the patio.  Ranma picked up a hot tea-kettle from the table as she passed, and stepped out  onto the grass to quickly explain the curse to the duplicates. "Alright, pay  attention. I'm not gonna explain this twice," she began, explaining how her  father took her to Jusenkyo and knocked her, at the time him, into the  Nyanniichaun. Using half the water in the kettle, he restored himself to  normal, and as expected, Copy-kun instantly produced cold water to test the  story. Ranma fumed, but recalled how others had reacted to the same story. Ukyo  had spent hours pouring hot and cold water over her, out of sheer amusement.  Ranma, using the last of the hot water, warned the couple that the curse was  the only problem in his life they were spared from. It was in their own best  interest to avoid contact with anyone outside the dojo. Not that he believed he  could truly keep the two from bring new chaos to his life, but it was worth a  try.</p><p>After  wringing out his shirt and airing it for a few moments to dry, he joined the  others at the table, where Akane had finished explaining what had happened at  Mirror Mansion. Everyone already knew about the cursed mirror, and the spirit  that stole the image of whoever looked into it to fulfill her dream of finding  true love. It did not take much to explain the sudden chaos as Copy-chan tried  to abduct Ranma-kun, using the little trap mirror they had received from the  old man of the mansion. Or, the inevitable consequence of him tripping as Akane  set him free, crashing into the mirror, tearing down the seal and looking into  it a second time. Fortunately, Copy-kun spotted Copy-chan at once. It was  "love" at first sight. Akane and Ranma had seen no other option but to bring  the couple home until repairs to the mirror's seal could once again be  completed.</p><p>"Another  week?" Soun moaned, as Kasumi poured tea next to Akane.</p><p>Ranma  glanced over his shoulder and saw the couple mooning over each other. Closing  his eyes, he reminded himself that they were just reflections, and did not have  anything, really to do with him. That was not really him over there drooling  over his female side, he strained to convince himself.</p><p>"You  are so cute!" the boy declared, taking the girls hands in his.</p><p>"You  are more handsome!" she protested modestly, her eyes twinkling.</p><p>"Good  couple!" Ranma quipped, oblivious to the fact that it sounded like he was  bragging. He was just hoping their mutual absorption would prevent a repeat of  girl's rampage.</p><p>"You  are so right, Ranma!" Kasumi smiled, delighted by the sight of at least one  happy couple in the house.</p><p>"They're  so alike too…" Nabiki deadpanned.</p><p>Akane  just sat there with her eyes narrowing, pretending to complete indifference to  the situation. Down the table, her expression was mirrored by Genma, safe in  the retreat of his panda form.</p><p>"I  guess this is sort of like a honeymoon for them," Kasumi put in thoughtfully,  after a moment. Tea sprayed forth from Akane and Genma. Ranma jerked as if he'd  just been hit by lightening, his eye twitching madly. Nabiki raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Ka-  Ka- Kasumi!" Soun stammered, looking shocked.</p><p>Genma  stood up frantically waving a sign, It's an abomination! No copy of MY son can  be allowed to do THAT! Ranma and Akane flinched away as lurid images of  boy-type Ranma molesting girl-type Ranma danced through the minds of everyone  but Kasumi.</p><p>Akane whipped around on her knees, shouting, "YOU  PERVERTS!" A roundhouse punch accompanied the cry, catching Ranma on the chin  and blasting him out the open door into Copy-kun and Copy-chan, spilling them  all out into the yard.</p><p>Ranma,  after skipping all the way into the koi pond, splashed to her feet shouting,  "I'm not LIKE that!"</p><p>"What  didja do THAT for?" the other two demanded in unison.</p><p>Soun  came out onto the balcony and declared, sternly, "Ranma! I forbid you to sleep  with Ranma under my roof!"</p><p>Everyone  stared at Soun for a second. Soun, it should be noted, had not been that quick  to catch on to everyone else using "Copy-chan" and "Copy-kun" to distinguish  the reflections from Ranma. Oddly enough, his error in address sufficed to  penetrate his eldest daughter's cheerful obliviousness. The synapse marked  "clue" connected to the synapse marked "ecchi" in an instant of unrepressed  thought.</p><p>"Oh  my!" Kasumi blinked. "You don't think they'd do THAT, do you?"</p><p>Everyone  catapulted onto their respective faces, spastically.</p><p>Ranma  sprung to her feet again, growling, "I don't even know what you're TALKIN'  ABOUT! How can I NOT sleep with myself?"</p><p>"Ranma-kun!  Think about what you're saying!" Nabiki warned with a shake of her finger, but  Akane had already reacted.</p><p>"Ranma  no HENTAI! Don't you have ANY restraint or morals?" Akane advanced on her  fiancé, mallet-sama in hand, amidst a pillar of blue flames.</p><p>Ranma  backed up slowly, hands out in warding gestures. "W- wait! Are you insane? Do  you ever hear what I am saying?"</p><p>"You  said you wanted to sleep with yourself!" Akane growled. "PERVERT!"</p><p>Ranma  hung her head, while Akane closed the distance menacingly. On an instinctive  level, the red-head estimated the power and intent of the other girl's rage. It  had soared quickly to lethal levels. If she ran, Akane would charge and kill  her. If she stood her ground, Akane would charge and kill her. If she wanted to  live this time, she would be forced to defend herself. Even in deadly peril,  such as her keenly honed instincts assured her she was in, she didn't want to  raise a hand against Akane. At the same time, she was sure she had not said nor  done anything to deserve her fiancée's anger. Almost to herself, she  muttered, "Damnit, Akane, there ain't nothin' wrong with a guy sleepin' by  himself. It ain't like I've got any other option…"</p><p>Akane,  having closed to attack range, had already swung her mallet high. As those  words penetrated, her hands suddenly let go on the downswing, and the mallet  flew off over the compound wall and out of sight. Akane stood there, meeting  Ranma's eyes, for several long breaths. "Did… did you say… b- by yourself?"</p><p>Ranma  scowled, "What didja think I was sayin'?"</p><p>"You  don't want sleep with one of THEM?"</p><p>"Do  you think I am some kind of pervert?"</p><p>"Geez,  Ranma-kun! Get a clue!" Nabiki shook her head.</p><p>Akane  and Ranma remained squared off, both of them blushing in confused fury. Ranma's  clones stared at the two of them. Off in the distance, a large object could be  heard crashing to Earth with a skull ringing KLUNK followed by a distant,  "Raaaaanmaaaaaa! This is YOUR FAULT!"</p><p>Kasumi  broke into the silence to muse aloud, "Having three Ranma's in the house could  get confusing. Maybe we should come up with some different names so there are  no misunderstandings."</p><p>"Now  there's an idea," Nabiki smirked.</p><p>As afternoon settled toward evening, Ranma and  Akane completed their homework in something of an armed truce. Ranma kept  glaring at Akane, silently bitter over the fact that she had never responded to  his last question, nor apologized for the misunderstanding. Akane kept glaring  at Ranma suspiciously, waiting for him to prove what a pervert he really was.  The two mirror clones had given up on trying to sneak off for some privacy, because  Soun and Genma had shadowed them at every turn, harassing them into sullen  complacency in front of the television.</p><p>Strangely  enough, the pair had proven difficult on the matter of names. They  automatically responded to "Ranma" and seemed to understand they were being  addressed when referred to as "Copy-chan" or "Copy-kun" but they scowled and  dismissed a catalogue of names suggested by the others. Memories of Pantyhose  Taro's notion of a perfect name kept everyone from eliciting a suggestion from  the clones themselves. Eventually, the topic of names was dismissed. They were  only supposed to be around for a week, and it was inevitable the two would be  mistaken for Ranma more often than not, or in Copy-chan's case, Ranko, if  Nodoka paid a visit. Kami forbid! It made more sense for them to respond to  names he used. Both of them would respond to "Ranma" in general, but if they  needed to be distinguished from him (or her as the case might be) Copy-kun  (-chan) would suffice. For some reason, the suggestion to dub the girl "Raneko"  was shouted down by all three Ranmas, and dismissed with the accompaniment of  shudders.</p><p>Ranma  spared a glance from his homework to check on the doppelgangers. They were  sitting close together, speaking in hushed voices, paying more attention to  each other than the show on television. He resisted the urge to go over and  hear what they were discussing so intently. The conspiratorial whispering made  fine beads of sweat pop out over his brow. Since there were no cats around, he  decided a lethal dose of curiosity was not needed at the moment, and forced  himself to ignore the couple. His mind strayed off on a tangent, as he wondered  how to harness the "curiosity killed the cat" technique. Naturally, this was  more important to him than his homework.</p><p>Time  passed, marked by the sound of chimes dancing in the breeze.</p><p>"Time  to eat, everyone," Kasumi announced a short time later, from the door to the  kitchen.</p><p>Akane  and Ranma jumped up to clear the table and put their schoolwork away. It was  left to them to help set the table, as Nabiki continued to lounge in front of  the television, spying on the clones, and Genma and Soun remained glued to  their game of Shogi. Neither of them dared turn to acknowledge Kasumi with a  look, or the other would swiftly rearrange the board.</p><p>Inevitably,  the smell of food lured Genma's attention and Soun cheered his victory. The  fathers joined the rest at the table and praised the bounty loudly.</p><p>"Itedakimas!"  everyone chorused, and dug into the food. A quick four way battle ensued  between Genma and the Ranmas, with the older man struggling to defend his meal  on three fronts.</p><p>As  dinner came to a close, the group discussed sleeping arrangements. Soun's  declaration still stood, though it was Kasumi who restated it as, "It just  would not be proper for the children to share accommodations." The clones  looked on, glares sharpening with every word. Ranma and the others could not  help but try to keep them separated. The idea of the two of them getting  together, intimately, was too creepy for them to stand. They were in silent  agreement. No one particularly cared about them fawning over each other, but…  they actively would try to discourage anything ecchi or hentai.</p><p>"It  would be best if Copy-chan slept with you tonight, Akane-chan. Copy-kun can  sleep with Ranma-kun and Saotome-ojisan," Kasumi suggested.</p><p>"Are  you sure it's a good idea to put those boys together, Oneechan? I mean, one  little splash of water and…" Nabiki held up her hands and shrugged. It need not  be said that chaos would ensue.</p><p>"Erk!"  Ranma choked. "I'd rather spend another week sleeping in a tree!"</p><p>"Hah!  Like I'd do anything with a pervert like you!"</p><p>"Hey!  That's MY line!" Akane fumed.</p><p>"No  one is going to come between me and my Ranma!" Copy-chan declared, standing.  "Put that silly panda outside for the night, let Akane sleep with HER Ranma,  and that leaves a futon for me and MINE!"</p><p>The  mere idea that this was a way to get Ranma and Akane together was enough to get  Soun and Genma to their feet, pushing the clones together, "That's right! What  a perfect solution!"</p><p>Ranma  almost bought into it too, "Gee, Pops. Are you volunteering to sleep outside  then?"</p><p>"Er…  No, boy. Tendo-kun will surely let me sleep on the floor in his room. Right Tendo-kun?"</p><p>"Ah,  ha ha! Right Saotome-kun!" Soun sweat-dropped.</p><p>"But,  Father… Surely these two should be married, or at least engaged first?" Kasumi  asked wide-eyed.</p><p>Genma  looked over and opened his mouth, "As their effective father, I…"</p><p>Ranma  pounded his father out the open door. "Are you insane? Don't EVEN go there!"  Ranma stood in the opening, huffing, as his father landed in the koi pond. To  himself, "I can't believe he'd even THINK of giving his permission!"</p><p>KA-thwump!  Ranma was suddenly knocked down in his tracks as a diminuitive form burst into  the room from the yard shouting, "Whatta haul! Whatta haul!"</p><p>Happosai  dumped a bulging bag of lingerie on the floor and quickly reached for a bowl  full of food. While the diminutive old man was rapidly stuffing his face,  Copy-chan leaned over and pulled out a few pieces of lingerie. Her eyes widened  with delight, and she snatched up the bag and sprinted upstairs crying,  "Kyaaaaa! I have to try these on!"</p><p>Happosai  sat there in open-mouthed disbelief. Tears of joy and anger mingled and spilled  from his eyes. He sprung to his feet, "Sweeto! Ranma-chan! I am coming!"</p>
