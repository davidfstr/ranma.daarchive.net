</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Eleven: Stirring the Pot</p><p>The inhabitants of the  Tendo Dojo had become nervous over the course of the evening. Certain individuals,  particularly a pair of patriarchs, had been oblivious to the descending moods  of Ranma and his copies during dinner. Kasumi, who might not pay much heed to  any number of odd occurrences, was the most concerned by Ranma's withdrawal and  its effect on Copy-chan and Copy-kun. Nabiki, sensing it as well, was also concerned.  They would not be likely to do anything she could profit off of if they just  moped around like lumps. No one bought sad pictures of Ranma, even if there  were plenty people who would like to ensure his misery. Akane was getting angry  at the three of them for feeling so sorry for themselves—and for doing it so  well she was actually, almost, feeling sorry for them herself. Perhaps that  explained the activities they preoccupied themselves with once the trio had  disappeared upstairs. Kasumi, true to her nature, decided to go scrub the upstairs  hall, conveniently putting herself between the Ranmas and the rest of the  household. Nabiki wandered over to the phone and placed a quiet call to the  infamous Cat Café requesting a late night delivery from Shampoo. If the  purple-haired vixen could not shake things up, then nothing could. Akane sat  and stared at Genma. The man was looking thoughtful, and that was not an  encouraging sight.</p><p>Ironically, there were some parallels between Genma's  thoughts and the conversation upstairs. The topic in both cases was: Nodoka,  and the ever-present threat of seppuku that hung over their heads. While Ranma  was explaining the history of that fateful contract, Genma was pondering a  positively "inspired" solution.</p><p>In the guestroom, the copies stared at Ranma with  open-mouthed disbelief. "So, let me get this straight," Copy-kun interrupted. "Your  dad took you away from your mother when you were, what, five? Six? He had you  on the road for ten years or so, and he never so much as mentioned your mother's  existence until she showed up a few months ago. You didn't even know about this  agreement until she told the Tendos?"</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma sighed and filled in a little more detail, "The  whole time my old man was sendin' home letters and such lettin' her know how my  training was going. Of course he musta been making stuff up, since the truth  woulda probably given her a nervous breakdown or somethin'. When we both got  cursed the idiot stopped writing, and she began tryin' to track us down." He  snorted in disgust, "He practically guaranteed she'd find us, and thanks to  this stupid curse he got me, she's liable to kill us on sight!"</p><p>"That's unbelievable! She's that serious about all this 'Man-Among-Men'  non-sense!" Copy-chan leaned away and shuddered as Ranma nodded.</p><p>"I've already had some close calls. She carries our  family's honor blade everywhere she goes, just in case she runs into me and she  decides I'm not man enough to suit her."</p><p>"That's insane. Surely, if you just explained the curse,  she would understand!"</p><p>"I won't risk it. I mean, she knows my Pop. He'd try to  fast-talk his way out of getting caught by gravity. She ain't gonna let us make  excuses for our failure."</p><p>"But you said she's always coming over here and teaching  you to cook and taking you shopping for girl stuff."</p><p>"She doesn't know it's me. Pops and I use our curses to  hide from her. I pretend to be Akane's cousin, Ranko, and Pops pretends to be  my pet panda," Ranma explained. He went on to explain how, the first time his  mother saw him, he was in girl form, and she had lectured her about being such  a tomboy. "All this stuff she's doin' to make a proper 'lady' of me, it's  become the hardest part of dealin' with my curse. I can't say no, and I end up  tryin' to please her, but then I end up changin' back into a guy so she sees me  in girls' clothes or somethin' and…" he trailed off.</p><p>"Has that really happened? How did you get out of it?"</p><p>"I dunno. She had me dead to rights. She caught me with  Akane, when she just thought I was some pervert, but Akane helped me slip out  of that. Then, when we thought she left, she snuck in and… Some stupid stuff  happened that made her think the 'pervert' was molesting Akane. I use one of  Pop's tricks to get away, and she realized it was me, and started goin' on  about how the stuff I was supposedly doin' with Akane was okay if I was engaged  to her. I thought, if she felt that way, I could finally confront her, but  Happosai interfered. He dressed me in a school girl's outfit while we were  fighting, and Mother walked in just in time to see it, and remember when she  caught me in 'Ranko's' clothes. She started the ceremony for seppuku on the  spot," Ranma shuddered, as he relived that fateful night. "I couldn't sit there  and take it, so I split. The others came up with this plan to have her catch me  peepin' on Akane in the bath, to prove how, in spite of being a 'crossdresser' I  had more manly interests. The stupid tomboy! I was all worked up, cuz she  always gets so violent if someone sees her naked. Instead of bein' naked, she  was wearing her bathing suit covered in soap suds. I couldn't believe it!"</p><p>"What, you actually wanted to see her naked?"</p><p>"You gotta be jokin', right! That macho chick!" he  flinched, expecting a hammer to descend from out of nowhere. When nothing  happened he continued, "The point is, she was supposed to be naked when I was  peeping so my mom would be convinced that I liked that sort of thing.  Naturally, she screwed it up. I figured at that point that I was a dead man."</p><p>"You don't looked gutted and decapitated."</p><p>"Nah, Nabiki said my mom thought I was just acting  disappointed. Then Happosai threw some Happodaikarin at me and Mom tried to put  out the fuse with the sprayer. Pops knocked me out the window so fast she didn't  see me change, and I haven't seen her since then."</p><p>"Were you disappointed?"</p><p>"Why would you even ask?"</p><p>"It's just… are you interested in naked girls at all?"</p><p>"Half the time I am one! Why would I get excited about  that?"</p><p>"Uh, good point."</p><p>"Anyway, you ought to understand now why I can't accept  my girl side. I have to be a man, or I have to kill myself."</p><p>"Um. Maybe that's how your mom sees it, but, what about  you? If you didn't have all of that over your head, would you still fight being  a girl?"</p><p>"My mom's only half the problem. All my life I've been  nagged by my old man about how weak and useless girls are. Because I've been a  girl, I know it's not like he meant," he added quickly, as Copy-chan reared up  in anger. "My girl form is weaker than my guy form. Softer and smaller too. It  doesn't keep me from being able to fight, which is about all that matters as  far as I am concerned. As a girl I trade speed for strength, agility for  toughness, and compared to most guys, I am still pretty damn strong. As a  student of Anything-Goes, turning into a girl is actually an asset sometimes."  He sighed, trying to figure out how to make his point. "Bein' a girl isn't the  problem. The problem is not being able to be myself, no matter what I look  like."</p><p>Copy-chan studied him for a long moment, before  asserting, "You're missing the point. Appearances are just on the surface.  Turning into a girl is more than a change of form. It's a change of function.  You don't just turn into a 'girl', you become female." From the look on his  face, she was stating the obvious, but that did not mean he was getting it. She  decided to take a different approach. "Is your dad a better person than your  mom, aside from the fact that he's forced her into a situation where she's  honor bound to kill you?"</p><p>"Are you kidding! My old man is like a nightmare.  Compared to him, my mom is the best person in the world!"</p><p>"And which of them would you rather take after?"</p><p>"Huh!" Ranma stared at her in shock.</p><p>"As a person. A human being, which of them would you  rather be like?"</p><p>"I don't ever want to be like Pops!"</p><p>"I didn't ask what you don't want. You can't know somethin'  by listing the things you don't want," she retorted saucily. After exchanging  glares, she continued. "So, if you had a choice, would you rather take after  your mom or your dad?"</p><p>"My mom, I guess."</p><p>"So, even though she is female, you believe she's a  better person, a better role model, than your dad," it wasn't quite a question.  The statement forced Ranma to pause in thought before nodding hesitantly.</p><p>"Do you realize that you could be like her? You could be  a mother. You could have kids and be the mother for them that you never had."</p><p>"Why would I want that!"</p><p>Copy-chan sighed and pressed on, "The point is, you can  have that. Did you ever consider that? No. Why? Because your dad insulted women  every chance he got, and now you think girls are useless, just like your dad!"</p><p>Ranma almost blew up. Unfortunately, she was right, at  least about how his father had poisoned his mind about girls. Instead of  erupting, the anger seethed as he tried to gather his wits. "Why are you  pushing me to be a girl?" he demanded when he could control his voice.</p><p>Copy-chan stood up and walked out of the room.</p><p>"Don't walk away! Tell me why you are doing this!" Ranma  shouted, jumping up to follow her. She ignored him, entering the upstairs  bathroom and going to the sink. Kasumi, on her knees scrubbing near the top of  the stairs, stood and casually walked downstairs when she saw them. Ranma  paused in the door way as Copy-chan turned on the faucet and splashed her face  with cold water. Ranma repeated his question, stepping forward to grab her by  the arm, "Why are you pushing me to be a girl?"</p><p>She squeezed her hand over the end of the faucet, sending  a spray of cold water into Ranma's face. As Ranma-chan spluttered in anger, she  finally answered, "You are a girl. Deny that, you deny a part of yourself. You  deny me, and frankly, it pisses me off!"</p><p>"Why! What the hell should it matter to me, anyway?"</p><p>Before Copy-chan could answer, Genma came up the stairs.  The two girls turned to look at him, wondering if he had heard the argument.  Genma glared at them and went into the guest room. From inside they heard him  speak to Copy-kun.</p><p>"Come downstairs, Boy. I need to speak to you in the  dojo."</p><p>Ranma-chan frowned and walked to the door. When her  father came out, she confronted him, "What's goin' on, Pop? What do you wanna  talk about?"</p><p>Genma did not look at her. "This doesn't concern you. You  keep that girl upstairs. I don't want her to interfere." Ranma blinked in  shock. For some reason, his old man had got it into his head to play sensei.  The tough formality was familiar enough, but his father seemed unusually cold.  It sent a shock of alarm through her. She stood there in confusion as Copy-kun  filed out after Genma. Copy-chan looked worried, as she joined Ranma-chan at  the head of the stairs.</p><p>"He's up to no good," the part-time girl frowned.</p><p>"Sounds like that's all he's ever up to," her twin  quipped. Standing behind Ranma-chan, an idea came to her. Impulsively, she  slipped forward, grabbing Ranma-chan by the hand, and dragged her down the  stairs. Instead of leading her through the hall and out to the dojo, she turned  as they passed the washroom and led the other girl into the furo.</p><p>"Hey! What are you doin' draggin' me in here!"</p><p>As she slipped out of her clothes, Copy-chan answered, "I  didn't get a hot bath earlier, and you look like you could use one now."</p><p>"We can't go in there together!"</p><p>"Why not? Not like I've got anything you don't know  about," she grinned, spinning around in the buff to display the familiar  assets.</p><p>"That's not funny. I warned you two to stop makin' passes  at me!"</p><p>"Don't you wanna know if I can bring out the man in you  as well as my other half can bring out your girl side?"</p><p>"Uh…"</p><p>"I mean, you must wanna know if it was him or you, right?"</p><p>"Th… that's so mean!"</p><p>"Huh! I thought it sounded like a generous offer! After  all," her grin turned evil, "what real man says no to an opportunity for sex!"</p><p>"I… I'm not a man right now," Ranma-chan cringed.</p><p>Copy-chan leaned close, her hands unfastening the ties on  Ranma's shirt as she whispered, "Don't worry. I know how to make a man out of  you!" Before Ranma could scream in alarm, Copy-chan pressed her mouth over the  other girl's and took her breath away. As intended, Ranma-chan chose to take  the proposition as a challenge, a way to prove his manhood.</p><p>As Ranma-chan was sinking  into a whole new kind of hot water in the bathroom, Shampoo was marching in  through the genkan. Nabiki, ever conscious of damage expenses, had left the  entrance to the house wide open for her arrival. As the purple-haired amazon stalked  into the building, she was craning her neck for any sign of her beloved Airen. "Nihao!  Delux Ramen Desert! Shampoo make special for Airen! Ranma? You home now, yes?"</p><p>Kasumi and Nabiki rushed forward, smiles of quite  opposite nature gracing their faces.</p><p>"Why, hello, Shampoo! Welcome to our home!"</p><p>"Shampoo! Just the person I was hoping to see!" Nabiki  quickly paid for the ramen, escorting the amazon over to the table. "Ranma is  out in the dojo, talking with his father. Why don't you go say hi, while Kasumi  and I set the table?"</p><p>"Aiyaa! Very strange Mercenary Girl be so nice! Shampoo  very surprised!" the girl giggled, bouncing in place as Kasumi took the heaping  bowl from her hands. "Shampoo Great-grandmother say Shampoo stay make sure  Ranma really enjoy special desert! Is okay!"</p><p>"Sure, Shampoo, make yourself at home," Nabiki fought her  grin back under control.</p><p>Shampoo bobbed a few times, either nodding or bowing in  appreciation, before launching herself out through the open shoji.</p><p>"She is such a happy girl!" Kasumi commented, laying out  cups and bowls.</p><p>"You can't buy that kind of happiness, Kasumi," the  middle sister responded, adding to herself, "Nope, the price for that is some  form of insanity, I am sure!"</p><p>Outside, as Shampoo ran around the house to get to the  dojo, she came to an abrupt halt. Her eyes narrowed as she spied Akane crouched  against the screened entrance to the training hall, ear pressed close to hear  what Genma found so important to say to Copy-kun. "What Violent Girl doing  spying on Shampoo Airen!"</p><p>Akane whipped around and instantly made shushing motions.</p><p>"You no tell Shampoo 'Shush!" the Amazon pulled out her  bonbori and went into attack position. "Shampoo teach Violent Girl not speak so  to amazon womans!"</p><p>"Shampoo! Please be quiet! Ranma's father is up to  something and I need to find out what!"</p><p>"Ranma father crazy man want Airen marry Violent Girl!  Shampoo go save Ranma from evil plot!"</p><p>Akane stared as the girl rushed straight at her, and  dodged out of the way. Just before the amazon could knock down the wall and  confront Genma, the shoji swept open and Copy-kun looked out in puzzlement.  Shampoo lit up at the sight of him, and flung her bonbori away so she could  leap in and crush "Ranma" in greeting. "Wo da Airen!"</p><p>"Urk!" Copy-kun wheezed as the air was squeezed out of  him. Not having had time to make out the girl's features as she pounced on him  out of the darkness, he instantly went into "flee from Kodachi" mode, jumping  straight into the air, bouncing off the roof of the house and contorting in his  efforts to break Shampoo's grip. Unfortunately, Shampoo was much harder to slip  away from than Kodachi. In his panic, he bounced down the length of the roof  and spilled the pair of them over the edge. Right into the koi pond, of course.</p><p>Shampoo, for all she hated it when her Airen dragged them  into water in his attempts to escape her embrace, was prepared for the trigger  to her curse. As her limbs and body lost the length and mass to sustain a grip  on her beloved, she sank her claws in to make sure she remained close to him.  As Copy-kun reared up from the pond, screaming from the sensation of cat claws  puncturing his flesh, Shampoo realized he  was still a him.</p><p>"Mraow?" she voiced her confusion. What this!  Airen no change!</p><p>Copy-kun, hearing that second bit of evidence, stiffened  and looked down. "It'sa… it'sa… it'sa… C-c-c-CAAAAAAT!" Automatically, he tried  to plant his hands in Shampoo's furry belly and push her away. Naturally, she  dug her claws in and scowled in discomfort. The boy emitted a few strange hiccupping  noises and then flopped face forward into the pond. Shampoo squirmed and tried  to swim away before his weight could trap her underwater. The instant her claws  released, the boy's arms and legs began thrashing in an uncoordinated attempt  to put maximum possible distance between him and feline hell.</p><p>In the bathroom, Ranma-chan jerked out of the arms of her  twin as the one, drawn out word penetrated the surrounding neighborhood. The  impromptu initiation into making out (which proved to be so engrossing, Ranma  had completely forgot about changing form) ceased, as the two girls went cold  with fear. Ranma-chan slipped into the washroom, grabbing a robe from the  laundry, and rushed out to investigate. "Stay here," she shouted to Copy-chan,  before slamming the shoji behind her. Racing through the hall, she caught the  delicious aroma of ramen. "Shampoo!" she concluded at once.</p><p>Shampoo had been distracted, trying to clamber out of the  pond, and had caught only a glimpse of "Ranma's" departure. She completely  missed the sight of him crawling under the house. It had looked like he was  fleeing into the Tea Room. She did not have to question this assumption when  she peered into the well lit sitting area and saw Ranma-chan burst in from the  hall, wrapped in a loose robe. Their eyes met across that distance. Shampoo,  forgetting for an instant that "Ranma" had not changed while in the pond,  bounded straight towards the red-head. Ranma-chan eeped in distress and fled  back down the hall, past the washroom entrance to the bathroom, and out the  door leading to the dojo.</p><p>Copy-chan heard her twin race by the washroom door,  wailing in panic, and poked her head out to see where the danger was. She  caught the sight of Ranma-chan's back, legs flashing bare beneath the billowing  robe, but mercifully, no cat was on her heels. Or, not closely. Turning to look  the other way, she saw the purple-tipped cat coming into the hall from the Tea  Room, and flinched back in shock. Unable to even articulate her fear, she  screeched and raced into the bathroom. Whattodo! Whattodo! What…  water! Cat's hate water! she made a beeline  straight to the furo, Shampoo hot on her heels. Naturally, jumping into a hot  bath with "Ranma" was the last thing the amazon feared. She leapt up to  Copy-chan's shoulder as the girl was throwing herself into the steaming water.  She let out a scream and plunged in. To her shock, the weight of Shampoo's  normal form suddenly materialized on her back, bearing her to the tile bottom  of the furo. Rolling in desperation, as a different submerged fear took hold,  she dumped Shampoo's weight to the side and lunged up out of the water.</p><p>Before either girl could get her bearings, the two found  themselves locked together at the lips, their limbs entangled. Copy-chan  relaxed instantly, having no problems determining that this was not a cat. The  next thing through her mind was a fast-becoming-familiar thought. She REALLY  liked making out.</p><p>Shampoo was not prepared for the passionate response. Her  mind was still processing the sensations from her body that screamed that  something was wrong in Jusenkyo. The water was hot. Airen was still a girl. She  found that more important than the kiss. At least, once it penetrated the  mountain of bliss the same kiss had perched her on.</p><p>"What going on!" she gasped, pushing away from Copy-chan.</p><p>"I dunno… but it sure feels good!" Copy-chan mumbled with  a silly grin.</p><p>"What wrong with Ranma curse! First, no change in cold  water. Then change in no water. Now no change in hot water! That not right!"</p><p>Copy-chan managed to parse enough of the broken speech to  grasp that Shampoo understood the nature of Ranma's curse. She had no idea  where the girl had come from, or who she was, but she already knew the most  damning thing about her. She was yet another love-struck groupie of the  infamous Ranma Saotome. Feeling a new wave of rejection, she pushed the girl  away from her hard. "It figures. You only want HIM!"</p><p>"What you say!" Shampoo's eyes widened as her mind took  the available evidence and jumped to a conclusion. It was, after all, a well  traveled path in Nerima. "Why you say that! Ranma curse broken! You no more  can change to boy!"</p><p>Copy-chan, remembering that there was a cat nearby, had  not been paying attention. Catching the last part, and feeling a bit snappish,  she retorted. "Do I look like a boy!" she crouched down and splashed herself  with the hot water, "Sorry, it don't work on me. Too bad! Just a girl! Will be  for the rest of my life! You'll just have to find someone else!"</p><p>"No, no! Shampoo love Airen! Shampoo get  Great-grandmother to help. We find cure!"</p><p>"There is no cure!" Copy-chan screamed in the girl's  face. "Just go away! You don't even know me! I'm not your 'Airen', I'm not even  Ranma!" She stopped shouting as she saw the girl twitch in shock and pain, her  face crumpling into tears. Getting a handle on herself, Copy-chan sighed. "I'm  sorry..." she still did not know where the cat went, and she could no longer  resist the urge to flee the bathroom, for fear that it was lurking in a corner,  ready to pounce on her when she was alone. She rushed out through the washroom,  slipping into one of Ranma's big t-shirts, and sprinted in search of a  cat-proof room.</p><p>By the time Ranma-chan and Copy-kun had recovered enough  from their fright to return to the house, Shampoo had slipped into clothes from  the koi-pond-depository, and raced home to consult with Cologne. Genma was  waiting for them, looking royally peeved. He grabbed the pair and marched them  upstairs. To their surprise, Genma paused to shove Ranma into Akane's room,  where she crashed into Copy-chan cowering on her futon.</p><p>"You're sleeping in here from now on. I am not going to  have you messing with the boy's head anymore," Genma declared, turning and  bum-rushing Copy-kun into the guest room. The shoji slammed shut, and the lock  clicked loudly into place in the sudden silence. Akane, sitting on her bed, her  conversation with Copy-chan interrupted by the ejection of Ranma-chan from the  guest room, was too shocked to object to her fiancé's presence. Genma had made  a much more shocking statement with his declaration than any of them could  believe. Fortunately, Nabiki poked her head in and put it into words for them.</p><p>"So, your old man traded you in for a newer model, Ranma?"</p><p>"That… that… I'm gonna kill him!" Ranma-chan blazed.</p><p>"I don't get it," Copy-chan blinked.</p><p>"Not much to get. Boy. No curse. Good as Ranma at  fighting. Totally clueless. The perfect son," Nabiki listed casually.  Ranma-chan twitched in pain at every phrase. Before Ranma could rush across the  hall and commit murder, Nabiki added, "Well, Ranma, looks like you're finally  going to get out of that engagement with Akane."</p><p>Ranma-chan paused in confusion. She looked over at Akane,  feeling the bottom dropping out of her stomach, but Akane jerked her head  around, refusing to look at her. "A… Akane…"</p><p>"I don't want to hear it, Ranma. Keep the celebration to  yourself!"</p><p>"But, that is… I mean…"</p><p>Copy-chan  reached around and covered her mouth. Ranma-chan looked at her in shock as Copy-chan  shook her head. "Don't say anything. He's a greedy, arrogant, jerk, but it's  not going to change anything, right? You still intend to banish us at the end  of the week, don't you?" there was a lot of pain in the question. Ranma-chan  took a long time to nod in response. They both sighed in misery over it.</p><p>Halfway across Nerima, the very personification of misery  crashed into the dining area of the Cat Café and collapsed, sobbing, at a  table. Mousse perked up, from the back of the kitchen where the sound of her  distress pierced through the clamor of the most heinous task of washing dishes.  He rushed out spouting platitudes, unable to conceal his obvious joy that Ranma  had broken her heart and now, at long last, she would turn to him in her grief.</p><p>"My beloved Shampoo! What has Saotome, that thief of  women's hearts, done to hurt you!"</p><p>"Eat hot lead and jump in lake, Mousse!" she exploded  into his face, venting all her rage, all her frustration, and all the betrayal  she felt upon his helpless body. Through the violence, she continued to cry,  shaking with unbearable gasps of grief. Cologne, Matriarch and Elder of their  tribe, arrived from her room upstairs, unable to believe her  great-granddaughter's outburst. Her initial efforts to interrupt went entirely  unnoticed, so she settled on a nearby table and waited for the girl to come  crashing down. It took a while. When the girl was reduced to dry sobs, she hopped  over to her on her staff, and inquired.</p><p>"What had happened, dear child, to break your heart so?"</p><p>In a broken voice, with broken words, she sobbed out the  events of the evening. The tale was confusing, to say the least, but Shampoo  swore that she had seen, first, that Ranma did not turn into a girl when  immersed in cold water, and then, after a few minutes, he appeared as a girl  who, when immersed in hot water, did not change into a boy. She repeated the  conversation she had with Copy-chan word for word, breaking into fresh tears as  she repeated the assumed confirmation that the curse was broken, and she would  never again become a boy.</p><p>Cologne sat back, running the reported events through her  mind. The only possible scenario she could come up with was that somehow Ranma's  curse had been locked again, and he had gotten his hands on some instant  nannichaun in the hopes of regaining, if only for a moment, his lost manhood. Was  it possible that Herb had returned to punish Ranma after all? If the story  Shampoo told, that "Ranma" claimed there was no cure, was true, was it also  possible that the Musk had allowed the Kaisuifuu to be destroyed so that Ranma  would truly be trapped as a girl? These frightening possibilities were bad  enough, but to add that Ranma, by his final remarks, had forsworn his very  identity and declared himself a stranger, a ronin… It was unthinkable.</p><p>At the same time, it had been over a week since Ranma had  shown up at the Cat Café to mooch ramen from Shampoo. Very little could make  the boy pass on a free meal, unless he had a very good reason to avoid contact  with his meal ticket. Cologne picked herself up and patted her  great-granddaughter on the shoulder, "Indeed, this sounds most bleak. If all is  as it sounds, then son-in-law is in dire peril. I shall investigate this story  at once and see if I can determine if there is any solution to it. Be brave,  dear Shampoo. Hope is not lost yet."</p><p>"Oh, Great-grandmother! Thank you! Thank you!"</p><p>"Now, go to bed, and think on this no more. When I know  what can be done, if anything, I will let you know. Even if son-in-law must  spend the rest of his life as a woman, there are still many reasons why we must  try to bring him, or her as the case may be, into the tribe." As Shampoo limped  upstairs, Cologne allowed the rest of her thoughts to surface. In truth, if  there was a way to bring Ranma into the tribe as a woman, if the boy had it in  him to be a true woman, Cologne would welcome it above all other options.  Still, it was too much to hope that there was anything beyond a resemblance.  She returned to her room and the book that lay open on her bed.</p><p>"Fa Shen," she spoke to the book, "yours was a brilliant,  and tragically short life. Is it even possible that you could be reborn a male  and a foreigner?" Cologne sighed and continued studying the legends of her  ancestors. No one was directly descended from Fa Shen. She had died a virgin.  But many surrogates had risen from her grave. After a thousand years, it had  become rare for a victim of the nyannichaun to be given her exact form. In the  course of her life, it had happened only three times. Two in this most recent  generation. The monkey cursed by Herb had not fulfilled the prophesy. The boy…  she was still not sure of. "Curse Genma for a fool. To craft a weapon so pure  and yet so flawed!"</p>
