</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi -  Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Two: Stuck in the Middle With You!</p><p>The sky  outside the Tendo living room was a deep, velvety blue. Genma had sunk meekly  back into the koi pond at the sight of his dreaded master dropping in to  dinner. Ranma lay twitching, sprawled across the porch threshold. Clinging to  consciousness, he replayed what had just happened back in his mind. Kasumi,  suggesting boy-type Ranma-clone bunk with Ranma and his father, and girl-type  Ranma-clone room with one of the Tendo sisters, had set off a new round of  chaos. The pair quickly objected, asserting that they would share a futon,  starting the uproar at the table.</p><p>Genma was cooling it in the pond for  almost validating the union of the clones and… Ranma scrunched up his face  trying to remember. Sitting up, he slapped his fist into his palm. "That's  right!" Happosai had popped in, burdened with a wealth of sexy lingerie, and  the girl had sped off with the loot to try some on in preparation for her big  night. Happosai had not even given Ranma a second look! "What luck!" Ranma  picked up his bowl and resumed eating, delighted to be spared molestation for  once.</p><p>"Ranma-chan! Let me help you into those  silky darlings!" Happi cried.</p><p>As Happosai chased the girl up the stairs,  Nabiki and Akane rose quickly to their feet. One with an eager look and her  camera in hand, the other with a look of vengeful determination and a shinai in  her fist.</p><p>"Are you just gonna sit there and eat  while that wicked old man molests your twin!" Akane dragged Ranma to his feet,  propelling him along to aid in stopping Happosai, and the girl.</p><p>"It's not my problem! Why don't you drag  him…" Ranma's male twin was suddenly absent from the table. Looking up, they  spotted him following Happosai eagerly, ready to cast his vote for the best  ensemble. "That pervert!"</p><p>"Hey! That's my line!"</p><p>The fiancées raced up the stairs,  following the "perverts" into the spare bedroom. Happosai was proudly laying  out lingerie as Copy-kun gaped at the sight of Copy-chan shedding her clothing  with total abandon. Leaping into the room, Akane pounded the "pervert"  male-clone, while Ranma tried to keep the other one from stripping down.</p><p>"When are you going to stop being a  problem!" Ranma demanded.</p><p>"Hey! Watch the hands, mister!" Copy-chan  bonked him on the head.</p><p>"Don't get so excited! I'm pretty damn  familiar with… Gyaaah! Cold!"</p><p>Happosai, having splashed Ranma, handed  her a second pile of lingerie, "I knew there were two of you running around!"  Happosai had blundered into the middle of Copy-chan's campaign to capture Ranma  the week before, but had yet to learn how or why the kami had blessed him with  multiple Ranmas. As far as he was concerned, there could never be too many of  his favorite student! Always quick to exploit said favorite, he added, "There's  no need to fight over them, Ranma-chan! There's plenty for you to model too!"</p><p>Akane turned, spotted Ranma with the heap  of lingerie in her arms, and pounded her into the floor boards. Copy-chan  stared at this with wide eyes for a moment. Akane did not even spare her a  glance, raving at Ranma-chan, "This will teach you, you shameless, perverted  hussy!"</p><p>Ranma reared up, bits of tattered lingerie  hanging off of her battered form, "You sexless, macho, tomboy! How many times  do I hafta tell ya, I AM NOT *LIKE* THAT!" Ranma, practically hardwired to  return insults in kind, could not have said anything else, even to save her own  life. Akane puffed up, balling her fists and hammered the disheveled red-head  straight back into the wall.</p><p>"You're just as bad as HE is!"</p><p>"Who do you think you're talking to!"</p><p>Copy-chan blinked, shrugged indifferently,  and gleefully finished stripping down to slip into something slinky while Ranma  yelled at Akane. "Kyaaa! This is SO sexy!" She twirled around and then froze in  shock as something small and bony pressed itself into her bosom. "AAAhhhh!  Getitoff, gettitoff!"</p><p>As Copy-chan's distress reached ear  splitting decibels, Copy-kun snapped awake and lurched to his feet. He twisted  and lunged in to attack, his leg blinking through space like a strobe light. An  angry, black blur danced around the lightening series of kicks, then bounced  into focus near Copy-kun's shoulder. Without hesitating, the boy dropped to his  chest and whipped through a windmill kick, hands planted on the floor boards.</p><p>The kick launched Happosai at a wall, but  the agile, old master rebounded, laughing madly as he pulled a second water  balloon out of his gi. "Not too shabby, son!" Happosai crowed, dousing the boy  with water. "Three of them! Oh happy day!" Rocketing in on sheer momentum, arms  spread to grope the succulent bosom this excellent technique would summon, he  crashed into the boy's hard, flat chest. "No! What is this!"</p><p>In the moment of distraction, the boy  perked up, and squeezed Happosai tight in a bear hug. He locked the old man in  place, his gnarled old face pressed to the damp shirt to keep him from ogling  his girlfriend. "Gotcha, old man! No way you're gonna peek on MY girlfriend  now!"</p><p>Ranma-chan caught this out of the corner  of her eye, her gaze hardened. While muttering about the "girlfriend" comment,  she appraised the situation. Happosai leeched energy from his female victims,  when he molested them. Happosai clearly had not understood that her clones did  not share her curse, and had choked on the masculine energy he'd leeched from  Copy-kun.</p><p>While the boy kept Happosai distracted,  Ranma darted past Akane, snatching a blanket to cover the girl up. Akane had  finally noticed the other red-head and used that instant to lunge forward with  her shinai. Copy-chan sensed Akane's attack and dodged, unwittingly allowing  Akane to get in Ranma's way. Ranma had whipped the blanket out to snare  Copy-chan, and did not notice as it wrapped itself around Akane. Copy-chan,  catching on to Ranma's interference, dropped into a leg sweep, tripping the  bundled Akane into Ranma, who took the brunt of the impact, as both of them  tumbled to the floor.</p><p>"Ha! You two couldn't work together to  save your own lives!"</p><p>"Dammit! Copy-chan!"</p><p>"Don't mind me!" Copy-chan pulled down her  eyelid and stuck out her tongue, as Ranma wrestled with the writhing mass of  Akane in the blanket. While the couple untangled themselves from the blanket,  Copy-chan quickly changed through a series of outfits, provoking an escalation  of the struggle between Happosai and the boy. The old man was straining to get  his face around to look, and Copy-kun was twisting and writhing to block  Happi's view. "Oh! This is so nice! And this too!"</p><p>"Let me see! Let me see! Ranma! You are  going to pay for this!"</p><p>"Stop wiggling around you old toad!"</p><p>"Oooo! Look at this!"</p><p>Nabiki, who had taken station at the door  after Ranma and Akane raced in, kept the shutter on her camera clicking with  glee. "You go, girl! Smile!" and Copy-chan dutifully posed for the camera.  "Marvelous, now, turn to the side. What can I say, Copy-chan, you are a  natural!"</p><p>Happosai finally squirted out of the boy's  grasp and the two began bouncing around the room. Happi fumed, since he was  forced to divide his attention between the girl's display and the boy's  onslaught.</p><p>"Nabiki!" Akane sputtered, halfway free of  the blanket, "Don't encourage her like that!" In spite of the struggling  tom-boy, Ranma was making progress freeing her fiancée from the blanket, albeit  becoming more entangled herself in the process.</p><p>"Akane, please relax for a minute,"  Ranma-chan begged, trying desperately to keep her favorite blanket from being  shredded by the other girl's struggles. Akane did pause, not so much to heed  Ranma's request, but to reflect on the observation that Copy-chan somehow  managed to complete each wardrobe change in the instants where the old man and  the boy kept each other distracted from her. Considering where Copy-chan came  from, Akane found it hard to credit her with possessing any instinct or  intention to preserve her modesty. Certainly not when the outfits seemed more  sinful and shameless than abject nudity. Still, in the time it took Ranma to  untangle them from the blanket, Copy-chan never once stood naked before male  eyes.</p><p>As Ranma sped over to try and stop  Copy-chan from continuing with her little fashion show, and Akane tried in vain  to intercept Happosai, Nabiki continued to click the shutter on her camera.  Nabiki noticed her little sister's attention was focused more on Copy-chan than  the old lecher. "I see you noticed it too," Nabiki casually addressed Akane.</p><p>"Huh? You mean Copy-chan?"</p><p>"Yes. It's an ingenious strategy. She  draws their attention to herself when she's 'presentable.' They renew their  struggle and become distracted. She has a bit of privacy to change and then she  starts the cycle again," Nabiki appraised admiringly. Granted, she chose not to  mention that this strategy had not foiled her camera. As Copy-chan evaded a  hammer strike from Ranma-chan, the Tendo sisters observed that the copy had  also picked up the Saotome-exclusive, and technically "sealed" art of the  Umisen-ken. Copy-chan suddenly vanished from view, followed almost at once by  Ranma-chan's clothes.</p><p>"D-d-dammit! Now you're askin' for it!"  Ranma-chan growled. Naturally, Ranma-chan retaliated in kind, and stripped the  other girl bare using the same technique. At the same time, her Copy-chan  extended the technique to actually dress Ranma in a stunning bedroom ensemble.  Nabiki silently thanked the kami that she had upgraded her camera, holding the  rapid-advance tightly. Copy-chan was able to dress the pair as quickly as  Ranma-chan could strip away the lingerie. Under such circumstances, Nabiki set  a personal speed record changing out the film in her camera, desperate not to  miss a single frame.</p><p>"Ranma, you're just making it worse,"  Akane growled. Her own efforts to deal with the old man and the boy were  fruitless as well. Happosai bounded around the room evading Copy-kun, and Akane  was spinning in circles just to keep track of them. It was not unlike watching  Ranma and P-chan fighting. "Leave her to me, and get those two out of here!"  For once, there was no argument. Ranma-chan was happy to retreat from the  humiliating onslaught of panties and bras and other unmentionables. That did  not mean she was above taking advantage of her presently lingerie clad form to  lure Happosai from the room, while Akane put up a screen to hide the other girl  from view.</p><p>With a "Come and get me!" Ranma-chan drew  the attention of old man and the boy to her. Looking around and not seeing the  other red-head, they pursued her out the door and down the stairs.</p><p>It took only a moment for Copy-chan to  notice her audience had rushed out of the room. Before she could follow,  ostensibly to get Copy-kun's opinion on her current ensemble, Akane blocked  her, "Hold it right there!"</p><p>"Why are you still getting in my way!  Huh?"</p><p>"Don't get the wrong idea. If you want to  be molested by Happosai, be my guest. Just tell me one thing first," Akane  crossed her arms and looked at her sternly. Copy-chan sighed and gestured for  her to get on with it. "How can even a pervert like you stand to be wearing  underwear stolen from someone else?" Akane demanded with a shiver and a look of  pure disgust.</p><p>"S-st-stolen? As in, other people have  worn these!" Copy-chan gaped as Akane nodded. Copy-chan stripped off the  lingerie, kicking everything into a pile. "Ick! Ew! Gross!" Before Akane could  celebrate her success in stopping Copy-chan, the girl ran out of the room stark  naked and swearing under her breath.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going like  that!"</p><p>"I gotta take a bath, you idiot! What do  you think?"</p><p>"You freak! Put some clothes on!"</p><p>Copy-chan streaked down the stairs,  ploughing through a shocked Soun and Genma, who were in full retreat from the mad  dance that erupted in the wake of Ranma-chan, Happosai and Copy-kun chasing  through the living room. Copy-chan vanished into the furo as Akane paused to  check on the fathers. Each bore an angry red footprint square in the middle of  their faces. Akane dragged the pair into the living room as Ranma-chan raced  into the kitchen, barely ahead of the boy and the old man.</p><p>"Darling! Don't run!"</p><p>"Hotcha! Nowhere to run to!" Happosai  cackled.</p><p>For an instant, the two unwittingly  cornered Ranma-chan. "N-now, hold on a sec…" Ranma-chan tried to edge into  reach of the kettle heating on the stove. The boy, thinking she was edging over  toward him, moved at the same time as Happosai. Ranma-chan darted for the  kettle and crashed into the boy's open arms. He closed them around her  passionately, at the same time jerking the two of them out of Happosai's path.  Happosai sailed through the space Ranma-chan had just occupied, and rebounded  off the wall above the stove. He snatched the kettle as he passed, and tossed  it into the sink where it cracked open and spilled the hot water down the  drain.</p><p>"Good work, Ranma my boy. Now, just hold  her still for me…"</p><p>"As if I'd let a pervert like you touch my  girlfriend!" the boy jeered. Pushing Ranma-chan behind him, he raised his guard  to the old man. Happosai laughed, still flying right at him. As the boy opened  up with his amagurikan, Happosai handed him a couple Happodaikarin and launched  himself over the boy's head at Ranma-chan. She spotted the small, dark blur and  reacted instantly, whipping a large pot off the pot rack. The boy managed to  catch the bombs and whip around, to throw them at Happosai, as Ranma-chan  lunged with the pot, scooping Happosai and the bombs out of the air. The pot  slammed down on the floor, with Ranma-chan and the boy hopping on top of it to  keep the old man trapped. The Happodaikarin detonated in the confined space,  throwing the pair back away from each other.</p><p>While Happosai could have danced around  Ranma all night, two Ranmas proved too much for the old man. Trapped with his  own bombs, he was fortunate to survive the experience merely blasted into  oblivion and charred head to foot. Without a word, the two Ranmas moved as one,  raiding the refrigerator for food and bottled water and racing upstairs to collect  all the lingerie, wrapping it all up in a bundle with Happi inside. The boy  pulled out a small hammer, as Ranma-chan produced the magical compact mirror  she'd received from the man at Mirror Mansion. The boy bopped the old man on  the head, and Ranma-chan captured his gaze with the small mirror as his eyes  flickered open. With a whoosh, the wizened old master vanished into exile.</p><p>"I knew this thing would come in handy  again!"</p><p>"At last, that pest is out of our way,  Darling!" the boy snatched Ranma up in a loving embrace. Ranma-chan looked up  in shock, moving into perfect position for the descending kiss. Akane appeared  just in time to join Ranma in pounding the boy senseless.</p><p>"Bakahentai!" they chorused, stomping the  poor boy underfoot. They managed to get a hold of themselves as they realized  his continuing struggles were actually reflexive twitches of pain.</p><p>"That's two down," Akane breathed in  relief.</p><p>Ranma-chan nodded silently and picked the  boy up, carrying him over her shoulder. They dragged him to Ranma and Genma's  room and laid him out on the futon. While Akane covered him with a blanket,  Ranma went to her closet, grabbed some things from inside, and went downstairs  for a quick bath. Copy-chan was sitting at the table, done with her bath, oblivious  to Ranma-chan's passing. Male and dressed normally, Ranma returned from the  bath a short while later, with a bundle of roses. Sitting across from her, he  held them out silently, while Akane fumed from the door. Before she could storm  in, Ranma held up his hand, holding her off. Akane puffed up, ready to bellow  her usual challenge, as Copy-chan bent her head to breathe in the scent of the  flowers and suddenly swooned. Akane paused, a glimmering of understanding  passing through her, and raised an eyebrow. The roses must have been from  Kodachi, to knock the girl unconscious like that. Akane deflated, her thoughts  warring between the obvious fact that Ranma had come on to the girl, and yet in  the process put her out of commission. Unable to conclude that he had done  either the right or wrong thing, she simply helped drag the girl to her room.</p><p>"That's three," Ranma declared, wearily.</p><p>"I'm kind of surprised it's over already,"  Akane sighed, shaking her head. The two spent the next few minutes  straightening up after the pandemonium. Kasumi had already cleared the table  and cleaned the kitchen, while her sisters had been upstairs with the three  Ranmas. Kasumi had apparently avoided all the chaos by stepping out on the  upstairs porch for a bit of fresh air. Ranma sought her out to explain the  destruction of one of her pots, promising to replace it the following afternoon  on his way back from school. It was a small price to pay for getting rid of  Happosai.</p><p>It was  probably too much to hope that the clones would remain unconscious through the  night. Nabiki would not have even covered a bet that the two would remain out  of commission until the rest of the household was ready to turn in for the  night. Naturally, Nabiki was hardly surprised to find the couple mooning over  each other in the furo when she went in to take her bath. She surreptitiously  snapped a few pictures and thanked the Kami that Akane had allowed Nabiki to  bathe first tonight. Finishing up the last of the roll of film in her camera,  she cleared her throat.</p><p>"It's probably a violation of some natural  law that Akane did not find you in here first," she grinned, watching them both  start in shock. It did not take much imagination to picture the explosion  accompanying a visit from Akane. Shallow as their experiences were, the death-trap-in-a-dress  with the hair-trigger temper, called Akane, had made an impression on both of  them. Since her target of choice was Ranma shaped, it was not hard to classify  her as a threat to their own well being. Most importantly, however, their privacy  had been interrupted. Not feeling comfortable continuing their activities in  Nabiki's presence, they tripped over each other to vacate the bath. Shaking her  head, Nabiki shut the door after them and sighed, "Unbelievable. They're both  just like him."</p><p>Shortly, as Nabiki rinsed the soap and  shampoo away, and slipped into the warmth of the furo, Kasumi was trying to  complete her chores for the night. Opening the closet under the stairs, to put  a couple of small boxes up for storage, she was surprised by the sight of the  clones furiously ablaze with tension, struggling with nerves and apprehension  to consummate a kiss.</p><p>"Oh my! Please excuse me," she blushed,  quickly stashing the boxes on a shelf above the pair, and shutting the door.  Having averted her eyes at once, she had not noticed the two jumping apart,  their hair standing on end, clutching their hearts and panting in shock.  Entering the living room, Kasumi cautiously approached Genma. "Mr. Saotome, I  really think you need to talk to Ranma's twins."</p><p>The panda grunted, his attention  unwaveringly focused on the game with Soun.</p><p>"About what, Kasumi?" Ranma asked, rising  from his spot at the table and facing her curiously.</p><p>"Ah, well…" Kasumi blushed and fidgeted  uncharacteristically.</p><p>Ranma swallowed nervously.</p><p>"It's kind of startling. I mean, they are  so much like you, Ranma-kun."</p><p>Ranma opened his mouth to protest, but  Akane interrupted. "What have they done this time, Oneechan?"</p><p>"I think they are trying to make out under  the stairs. Only, they don't seem to be doing a very good job of it…" Kasumi  trailed off as Ranma and Akane rushed out of the room. It was hard for her to  determine which of them had looked more disturbed.</p><p>Ranma and Akane found the closet door ajar  as they approached. Looking inside, it was evident that the couple had fled  after being discovered. They looked around the dojo for a while, trying to find  them, but had little success. Ranma, reminded by his stomach that he had not  finished dinner, wandered into the kitchen to prepare a snack. Turning on the  lights, he spotted the couple in the corner, eyes closed and lips a hair away  from touching. Ranma stood there for a moment in a kind of shock. With one eye  twitching, he struggled with a feeling he could not describe. It was if he was  standing outside of himself, trying to stop what was happening by sheer will,  but at the same time feeling a perverse fascination. He could feel their chi  billowing around them like a furnace. The harder they tried to close the  distance, the more powerful the energy surrounding them. It was like they were  trying to force two magnets together the wrong way.</p><p>Finally he could not take it. He grabbed  the girl and whipped her around to face him. "What's with you? You didn't have  any problems kissing Ryouga!" he accused. The couple blinked at him in  confusion.</p><p>"Are you trying to encourage her!" Akane  pounded Ranma to the floor.</p><p>"That's not it at all!" he raged,  rebounding instantly.</p><p>"Seemed like it to me," the clones  muttered, mystified.</p><p>"You stay out of this!" Akane and Ranma  growled.</p><p>The couple slipped away as Akane and Ranma  continued shouting at each other. Even when they slipped outside they could  still hear the quarrel. The exchange quickly devolved into insults and  violence, followed by a silence punctuated by Akane stomping up to her room.  Unconcerned, the couple sought out a private perch on top of the house,  determined to get on with "binding" as Copy-chan so eloquently put it. Just as  the clones were trying to get back into the mood, Ranma turned up on the roof.  Ranma took one look at the two of them and finally lost it. Whipping the  compact mirror out of his shirt, he advanced on them. "That does it. If the two  of you don't break it up this instant, and go to your rooms, one of you is  going inside this with Happosai for the rest of the week!"</p><p>"Ha! We know all about that trap, Ranma!  You'll never trick us into it!"</p><p>The clones took up guard positions against  Ranma, waiting for him to make the first move. He bit his lip, cursing himself  silently. He felt confident he could trick one of them into the mirror. As his  copies, he knew exactly what they were capable of, and no one could know him  better than he knew himself. He tucked the compact away and stared them both  down.</p><p>Without warning, he darted in close, a  careful strategy of thrusts and feints exploded from him, as he forced the  other two into motion. He knew that they would try to trump this threat by  taking the compact from him. Which was why he had carefully palmed it. When  they tried to retrieve it from where they thought it was, during the fight,  they would open themselves up for an instant. Apart from taking advantage of  these openings, he was fighting almost entirely defensively. The battle coursed  between the roof, nearby trees and the compound wall. None of them attempted to  leave the immediate premises. The rest of the household quickly came out onto  the porch to see what the commotion was, and from the shouts, threats and  insults, realized that Ranma was trying to capture one of the clones in the  compact. To everyone's surprise, Ranma was the only one getting in clean hits,  playing his strategy perfectly to his advantage. Unfortunately, Akane decided  to jump in and help him. As she did, the clones changed their strategy subtly.</p><p>They had determined that Ranma had palmed  the mirror. They continued their probing thrusts. Trying to end the fight  before Akane got hurt, or distracted him, Ranma took the opening his clone set  him up for, producing the mirror and flipping it open, lightening fast, to  catch boy's gaze. The boy, prepared for this, moved his hand just before Ranma,  and caught him by the wrist, twisting it to break his hold on the mirror.  Catching the mirror in the same movement, he flipped it around in Ranma's face.</p><p>"Oh man!" he barely got out, before being  sucked into the mirror.</p>
