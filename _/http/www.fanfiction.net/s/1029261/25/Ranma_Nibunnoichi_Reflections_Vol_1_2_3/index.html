</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Twenty-Five: The Art of Dating, Step One:  Conversation</p><p>After watching Ranma's form  dwindle over the horizon, Akane suffered a pang of guilt. She found herself  painfully reminded of her actions when she gave the engagement to Nabiki; how  she kept wasting her chances to make up with Ranma and let things return to  normal. This situation was similar in that she desperately wanted reality to  return to something she was familiar with. Worse, because in some ways it had,  at least with Ranma setting off her temper and her cutting loose. She sensed  that if the cursed Ranma had patted her down like that, she might have been  able to restrain herself. Either because she had been acting like a girl for a  day or so, or because she still had that air of vulnerability that had subdued  Akane since the morning after she "slept" with Copy-kun. Even though she still  had a hard time thinking of "new" Ranma as "the" Ranma, it seemed she had no  trouble reacting to him that way. Or did that just go along with being engaged  to him?</p><p>Akane frowned. That did not sound like a flattering  thought. "I hit him because he deserved it! He's a boy, and a pervert!" she  stomped off in the direction he had flown. It was true, the engagement had  gotten under her skin from the beginning, but… "I'm not just taking it out on  him. He's an arrogant, insufferable, insulting, macho jerk!" she interrupted  her guilty thoughts.</p><p>The way his hands brushed over her, to smooth out her  dress, felt so… so… "I can't believe him! Pawing at me like that!" He was just  helping out, being nice… "Ha! I know how he thinks! Any excuse to take  advantage of a girl will do! It's not like he even likes me, he just gets a  kick out of wrapping girls around his finger! Casanova!" she kicked a rock  angrily, watching it embed itself in a privacy wall across the street as she  exited the park.</p><p>Akane sighed. "Who am I kidding? He obviously doesn't  have a clue what to do with a girl once he gets his hands on her," she  grumbled, remembering the uproar Ranma caused with his innocent admission of  sleeping with Copy-kun. She remembered the scared look that grew as everyone  got more and more upset with what he said, the total incomprehension of the  situation he seemed to be describing in harrowing detail. "Kami! Was that just  two days ago?"</p><p>Correcting for the lay of the land, or rather houses,  Akane crossed the street and turned a corner, plotting a zig-zag course to  where Ranma should have landed. As she walked, Akane remembered another  conversation with Ranma, before the copies had taken his identity away from  him.</p><p><i>            "Don't take this the wrong way, but what's so bad about  being a girl, Ranma?"</i></p><p><i>            Ranma almost replied without thinking. Snapping his mouth  shut at the last second he remembered what Copy-kun had said the night before.  "Nothin' if you happen to be a girl. It's not good if you're a guy though. I  mean, what would you call a guy who tries to dress or act like a girl or chase  other guys?"</i></p><p><i>            That was a no-brainer for Akane, "A pervert!"</i></p><p><i>            "Yeah. Would you wanna be called a pervert by people 'cuz  you look like a girl, but they know you're supposed to be a boy?"</i></p><p><i>            Akane opened her mouth and stared at Ranma. She did not  dare to answer. She was doing it to him all the time. After a moment, she tried  another angle. "Well, if you had amnesia, and didn't know you were ever a boy,  why would it be horrible to be like Copy-chan?"</i></p><p><i>            Ranma did not answer for a moment. He was staring at the  mentioned girl, looking worried. Sighing, he explained, "Because one day I  might remember, and everything I had done as a girl would be right there in my  face. All the things I swore I would never do, and suddenly they would all have  been done and I could never take them back. I don't know if I could live with  myself after somethin' like that. I… I don't know if I could be a guy after  that. I wouldn't know how to be me, I guess."</i></p><p>Akane sighed. If she had realized what leaving him alone  for one day would do to him, she would have glued herself to his side and  refused to let him go anywhere with Cologne. Ranma-chan was nothing like  Copy-chan. Well, she was a girl, but she knew Ranma-chan would not be running  around doing things her fragile male ego could never live down. She was just  demonstrating what happened when Ranma did not know how to be himself anymore.  She acted exactly the same way Ranma acted the first time Akane had ever seen  him, when she thought he was a she. Completely out of her depth, and like an  embarrassment to life itself. There was something really wrong with the world  to make someone normally as confident as Ranma act almost ashamed to be alive.  "Pervert!" her voice echoed in her head.</p><p>Akane cringed. Everything changed so fast, it was already  too late to undo all the insults she had given, absolve herself for her part in  undermining Ranma's confidence. "Damn. I just can't deal with three Ranmas. Old  Ranma, new Ranma, girl Ranma, boy Ranma…" she wanted to strangle something. The  person she thought of as Ranma and the person she reacted to as Ranma were of  course two different people in her rational mind. Along with the name, Ranma  inherited all of the things that set her off, and sucked her in. All of the  guilt and sympathy that was gushing to the surface was pointed directly at the  cursed version, Ranma-chan. No, she corrected herself. That's the way she  wanted it. Her little guilt trip had started with how she treated HIM, and the  seeds of that guilt lay in the fight itself, when Kodachi accused her of  abusing Ranma.</p><p>As a martial artist, Akane had always taken the code very  seriously. She honestly objected to people who beat up on those who were weaker  than themselves, those who could not defend themselves. That was how she began  fighting with boys in the first place, defending weaker kids on the  playgrounds. It was how she had become so popular, or at least respected, among  her peers. There were few kids in Nerima she had not personally taught a lesson  to or personally protected at some point in the past ten years. Her life had  been going really well until she reached high school. Her troubles had started  before that, with puberty, but it came to a head because of Kuno. It had not  taken her long to realize what boys had begun to see in her, and there had been  the occasional idiot who had tried to "prove" himself, or start a fight just so  she would flash her panties at some point in the battle. When virtually every  boy in school took up Kuno's challenge, she realized they all thought about her  the same way. The very idea of staring in the sick, perverted fantasies—she  knew what kind of manga they all read—of so many boys had caused something to  snap in her head.</p><p>Combined with being ambushed by larger and larger groups  of boys, it did not take long for her to stop holding back. She learned to hit  hard, hit fast, hit precisely enough to incapacitate in one blow, to inflict as  much pain as possible without permanently crippling anyone. Even the most  stubborn and insensitive boy would eventually give up and go away if he was  beaten soundly enough, she was certain of it. It was just a matter of figuring  out the required level of punishment. Since she was not out to kill anyone, she  still had a decent crowd of "suitors" when Ranma first arrived. By then, her  opinion of boys had hardened into a damning prejudice. Ranma was as tough and  tenacious as Kuno, and not only did he live with her, he had the engagement as  an excuse to try all sorts of perverted things with her, and her own family  would cheer him on! Was it surprising that she made it a priority, a virtual  reflex, to discourage any possible intimate interest he could possibly have in  her?</p><p>Akane had never once doubted the justice, the necessity  of beating on Ranma. She had been grateful for any excuse. He was such a threat  that she unconsciously shifted from retaliating for any physical assault  (because they were conspicuously absent) to lashing out for verbal and  emotional assaults. He hurt her, she was justified in hurting him back. Maybe  if he had not traded insults with all the enthusiasm that went into sparring  with his father, maybe if he was not as good at targeting his verbal attacks as  his physical ones, she would not have felt that her only effective way of  expressing herself involved instruments of blunt trauma. The fact that she  almost always managed to pound him when she needed to, occasionally stunned  her. She knew damned well he could defend himself. He had proven that there was  nothing she could do to even touch him if he did not want her to. She would  never hurt someone who could not defend themselves, but some one who WOULD not  defend himself; either he had nothing but contempt for her ability or he knew  he deserved to get hit. It practically guaranteed he would get hit. It was not  like he had not proved he could also take anything she could dish out.</p><p>Well, except literally.</p><p>Akane clenched her fists and forced herself not to think  about how he mocked her cooking. It just figured that the one thing she went  out of her way to do, trying to be nice to him, he rejected vehemently. It was  just proof that he had no interest in meeting her halfway, that he had no  consideration for her feelings!</p><p>Until this week, Akane had never even imagined she could  seriously injure Ranma. He could be hurt, she had seen that plenty of times,  but he always bounced back miraculously. It took a real serious hit just to get  his attention. But, confronted with a shaken, confused and vulnerable Ranma,  Akane had proven she could restrain herself. Faced with a situation where Ranma  was being destroyed before her eyes, a situation that could literally kill him,  she finally grasped that he was merely human. More than that, he might actually  be a decent person. Someone to be cherished and protected from those who sought  to use or abuse him.</p><p>Someone who had vanished as quickly as she had glimpsed  him, to be replaced by someone she hardly knew. Someone she should have known  all along. Someone she was literally obligated to have spent most of the past  year getting to know. The person behind all the posturing—and maybe Ranma had  to accept who he was, as a real girl, to be able to drop all the bull-shit. What  mattered was that what remained was Ranma's true character. A person who did  the things that needed to be done, regardless of the personal cost. A person  who refused to give up and die simply because no one else ever survived the  challenge she faced. A person who worried about who she would become more than  who she could no longer be.</p><p>Ranma-chan had shed her arrogance and machismo along with  her identity and had become a much easier person to get along with. The  feelings that occasionally flared up in Akane for Ranma had been encouraged by  this wonderful glimpse of her humanity, making her more real, and making "Ranma"  more of a caricature by comparison. The odd thing was, that boy, the new Ranma,  was not a counterfeit. That was the problem. He was better than the "original"  or perhaps it was more appropriate to say he truly represented the original  Ranma, a normal, uncursed young man. Genma's son. Physically, mentally,  emotionally, the genuine article. He was exactly what "Ranma" was supposed to  be! So naturally she resented him—being engaged to him—more than ever. Just as  their fathers had pushed this date in response to her matchmaking with Ranko  and Ryouga, they would push for a quick marriage and the haunting thought put  her more on edge than ever.</p><p>She had no more desire to be married now than she did  when she first learned of the engagement. She had learned to like "Ranma", to  respect his abilities and even appreciate some of his charm, but he had a lot  of character faults and he really did know how to rub her the wrong way. He  acted like a jerk, whether he knew it or not. The insults and the violence had  become a feature of their relationship and she could not fix it alone. If Ranma  could take her seriously, just a little, and not laugh at her all the time,  even when she was… no especially when she was mad at him, she would never  overcome her temper. Knowing she was overdoing it, and vowing to stop, would  never amount to anything if he constantly infuriated her to the point where she  could not remember such noble resolutions.</p><p>Her mind continued to wrestle with such thoughts as she  walked. Eventually she encountered Ranma on his way back to meet her. Without  speaking, they fell into step and turned towards the shopping district of  Nerima in search of a place to eat. Their twice interrupted date was waiting.</p><p>Ranma concealed his surprise  at the worried expression on Akane's face when they met up. He had been doing  some thinking, and clearly she had done the same. It was funny, really, but he  had actually felt a kind of relief at being blasted by her. It seemed so  familiar, he could almost imagine things were back to normal. Akane could be  real violent, and woe to any boy who insulted her, but the truth was, she had  mellowed out quite a bit. She no longer lashed out at every boy for being male.  In fact she had been very nice to several, usually the ones trying to kidnap or  marry her. Shinnosuke was the big exception. He was also the reason she had  been creeping him out. She had begun to treat him the way she had treated  Shinnosuke, and he understood now that she had been so nice out of guilt and  concern, because he was dying and she felt partially responsible. She was still  like that around Ranma-chan.</p><p>He frowned slightly. Thanks to Shampoo and Ukyo, back at  the clinic, he was painfully conscious of his 'counterfeit' status, and Akane's  concern for Ranma-chan suggested she did not think of him as the real Ranma  either. That hurt, particularly after Ranko had rubbed his face in the feelings  he quietly harbored for her and normally kept hidden even from himself. So,  while he resented being hit by her as much as ever, it was comforting that at  least her reflexes, her temper, recognized him as Ranma. Ranma was the only  person she ever cut loose on like that. Well, for such a trivial reason,  anyway.</p><p>After walking for a while in silence, they finally came  to the restaurant Ranma had chosen for the night. It was an expensive, fine  dining establishment, spared from competition with the Cat Café and Ucchan's  through the simple expedient of out-classing them in every category except  quality of food, where it was hit or miss. A quick consultation with Nabiki had  established which dishes were exceptional and which were to be avoided, and how  to make a reservation that would not disappear the instant Ranma and Akane were  recognized as two of the notorious martial artists of Furinkan High. Still well  funded from Nabiki's kick-backs on Monday, Ranma could afford both the advice  and the bribes necessary to reach their seats. Once they were left to peruse  their menus, Ranma leaned forward and whispered menu suggestions from Nabiki.  Akane thanked him, and this started up conversation at last.</p><p>"This place is a lot nicer than I expected," Ranma  commented, taking in the decor. The tables were set high, western style, with  fine linen table cloths and napkins, western eating utensils, stiff, high  backed chairs. He felt himself automatically slipping into the manners  ingrained during his martial dining training. "I think the head chef has been  on that show Kasumi and Pops like to watch," he informed her, sharing another  tidbit Nabiki had armed him with.</p><p>"Iron Chef? I think I've seen you watching as much as  them," Akane smiled. She looked around, "Nabiki has brought the family here  once or twice for special occasions, like when she cleared the second mortgage  on the dojo. Oh, and when Kasumi graduated."</p><p>Ranma smiled and nodded. That must have made Kasumi feel  like a queen, he mused. She was so self effacing, a celebration in her honor  would be like a day in heaven, too good to be true. "Well, I hope you like it.  If not for Picolet, I would not be sure about going to a French restaurant. The  French go for some really strange food, stuff I've only had to eat to keep from  starving!" he laughed easily.</p><p>"You mean, like frog's legs?" she smirked.</p><p>"Oh, just the legs? Maybe that's the trick," he looked  surprised. "Well, next time I won't eat the whole thing, maybe that way I won't  get sick!"</p><p>"Oh, you didn't!" she gasped, laughing.</p><p>"Well, the way Pop's cooked 'em, I didn't know they were  even frogs until he told me afterwards." They laughed together, companionably.  Ranma decided he liked this Akane, smiling, laughing, seemingly carefree. The  worried Akane made him feel like someone had set snakes loose in his belly. He  sighed and composed himself. The waiter arrived and took their orders. In the  silence following his retreat, Ranma found himself studying the items on the  table. He realized that he had pushed his water glass as far from him as he  could manage without putting it in front of Akane, and started laughing again.</p><p>Akane gave a confused frown, "What's so funny?"</p><p>Ranma grinned at her and reached for his glass, "This."  He carefully took a deep swallow and placed it precisely where it belonged,  above his knife. "I am so used to avoiding it, I pushed my water away without  even thinking about it," he chuckled slightly and gave a sigh.</p><p>Akane did not laugh with him. Her face went blank, almost  sad.</p><p>"What's wrong?" he asked, frowning.</p><p>Akane tightened her jaw, biting back the first thing that  came to her lips. She shook her head and forced a smile, "Nothing. I was just  thinking."</p><p>"Ah, damn," he sagged. "I shouldn't have reminded you."</p><p>"No. I'm sorry, I…" Akane pleaded quickly.</p><p>"You don't have to dance around it," he interrupted  gently. "Ukyo and Shampoo have both said it to my face. You still think I am a  copy. I can understand that," he sighed.</p><p>"I don't know what to think. It's just strange. All of  it."</p><p>"You know, I remember your reaction when Nabiki told me I  was being replaced by my copy," he confessed impulsively. She looked at him  startled. He gave her a grim smile. "It's funny, isn't it? To me, Copy-kun was  both a different person, an' about two days of having no memories of who I was.  For me, I walked into a room, sort of like walking into a dream, an' when I  walked out, I was cured. I knew before I even walked out what I was walking  away from. Not just the curse, but from my old life. The old mummy warned me I lost  more than just the ability to become a girl, and I didn't understand. I didn't  want to understand."</p><p>Akane stared at him, trying to understand what he was  saying.</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath and shrugged, when she remained  stumped. "I can't argue that this isn't a copy of my body," he pointed out,  casually. "My first instinct was to think of the other Ranma as the copy, the  flawed version. But every now and then we fall into the same pattern of  thoughts or actions, an' I realize that she's me. Both of them, really. Ranko  has it bad, 'cuz she… it's her worst nightmare come true. I feared it more than  death, from the day Herb locked my curse. Once I knew it could happen, I feared  the day it WOULD happen. Ranma-chan, though. She makes me ashamed of everything  I am, 'cuz, while I haven't changed or done nothin', I've taken everything away  from her, forced her to become what she is." He looked down at his hands, which  had dropped and folded in his lap.</p><p>"Do you wish you never came back out of the mirror?"  Akane sought out his eyes. She was trying real hard to understand what he was  telling her, calling on the story Cologne had told them. "You were a girl when  you pulled Ranko out, there was no reflection of a boy in the mirror until you  changed. It would not have been the same as leaving her in the mirror."</p><p>"I wondered if anyone else would see that," he sighed. A  bitter laugh escaped him. Meeting her eyes he smiled sadly, "It's sort of  funny. I made the decision as… thinkin' I'd be stuck with the curse, knowing  that I'd lose it all, and I did it for Ranko. I did it so she would not have to  face this alone," he rubbed his hands over his face then stopped covering his  eyes and resting the weight of his head on the table through his elbows. In a  very subdued voice, he confessed, "I was supposed to be where Ranma-chan is."</p><p>"You won by losing," she realized, softly.</p><p>"I got what I really wanted, when I no longer wanted it,"  he nodded. Straightening, he squared his shoulders and hardened his features.  His eyes were focused on something only he could see. "There was one good  reason for this," he declared. "It was Pop's idea, but it was on 'Ranko's' mind  when I let her out of the mirror. 'Ranma' had to be a true man for my Mom. I  made that decision the morning he confronted me with his plan to make Copy-kun  me. I didn't think it would be ME, but I wanted to be able to give her that. I  made promises to myself, one of them Ranma-chan has kept, by giving everything  up. This one, I have to keep. I am here because I love my Mother more than life  itself. This, living like this, is the promise I have to keep to Ranma-chan and  Ranko."</p><p>Akane felt herself sagging under the emotional weight of  this confession. Taking deep breaths to keep tears from coming to her eyes, she  told herself she had the answer she was looking for. That real human being she  saw in Ranma-chan, that she hoped existed in her reflection; she had found him.  "You were about to say something, about my reaction to your Dad's plan, before  you explained this. Is there some connection?" she asked hesitantly.</p><p>He fiddled with his napkin in silence for a moment, not  sure if he should answer. He had changed tracks to avoid it, but what he had  said instead almost made it worse. "I know you don't want the engagement. I  also knew…" he sighed and tried to meet her eyes again. "I also knew when I  made the decision to 'bring Copy-kun' back, that even if I didn't you'd still  be stuck with it. I knew if I did, you'd think I was trying to get out of it. It  sorta felt like that, too, since I didn't think I'd be here." He looked down  and gestured to himself.</p><p>"You're not exactly Copy-kun," Akane pointed out, trying  to head him off. The truth was, it had bothered her at the time, the idea of  losing Ranma just when it started to seem possible to genuinely care for him,  and being stuck with a facsimile she KNEW was a complete pervert. "I admit it's  been difficult to believe you really are Ranma, not just a copy with all his  memories. But I don't think I really knew you, either of you, well enough to  understand the difference. Not until now," she confessed, blushing.</p><p>"Huh?" he sat back in confusion, that really surprised  him.</p><p>"I didn't expect this," she clarified, gesturing at him  vaguely. "I thought it would take forever for Copy-kun to remember being Ranma,  but instead, he goes away one morning and that afternoon THREE Ranmas come  home. You were all so much alike everyone's focusing on the differences and  making a big deal out of them because none of us can deal with you being in  three places at once."</p><p>"Heh! You should try it from this side!" he crossed his  arms.</p><p>"From what I can see, it's a wonder you're all sane and  haven't tried to kill each other," she frowned, taking a sip of water and  looking down.</p><p>"If it'd caught me by surprise, if I hadn't spent the  night thinking about it before hand, I probably would've completely lost it,"  he admitted. "I'd hate havin' what's happening to the other two happenin' to  me, but it bothers me a lot more to be watchin' it happen from the side. It's a  lot easier for me to understand what's happening to Ranko, I had to face that,  all of it, with the chisuiiton and the koi-rod and Picolet. I can imagine all a'  that happenin' at once, an' know what she's goin' through. Sorta all balances  itself out. I think I could survive that. What I hate is what's happening to  the other me."</p><p>"Me too," Akane folded her hands on the table and studied  him. She returned to the point he had yet to fully explain and frowned. "What  you were saying, then, is that she made the decision for you to be here. She's  the reason I am 'stuck' with you?"</p><p>Ranma winced at her emphasis of his wording, but nodded.</p><p>"But you, since it was you at the time, weren't trying to  get out of the engagement," she stated, picking up on the concern he had  expressed.</p><p>"This engagement was not our choice," he pointed out. "We've  both said that enough times, it'd be stupid to say we wouldn't wanna get out of  it. It's a matter of honor, though, so we put up with it. Together. In a way,  it kinda put us both on the same side. Us verses our dads. It kinda means we  have to depend on each other, or bad stuff, like what happened with Nabiki,  ends up happenin'." Ranma could see from the expression twisting Akane's face  that his words were either confusing her or starting to freak her out. "Aww,  man! I'm just not good at talking about stuff like this! What I mean is, there  was no way in hell I was gonna let my old man hitch you up with Copy-kun. This  engagement is my obligation. But I can't object to 'myself' as a substitute, so  there was nothing I could do to convince you I was not leaving you in the dust  to marry some jerk in my place."</p><p>Akane carefully tried not to comment on that. Her face  betrayed her.</p><p>"As far as I am concerned, I am still here. I ain't gone  nowhere. If anything I've actually fixed a problem since you no longer have to  worry about bein' engaged part-time to a girl," he pushed on, ignoring the look  that spoke volumes about the "jerk" she had already been engaged to.</p><p>Akane stared at him for a long time, realizing that Ranma  felt he had explained what he originally meant. The other things he had said,  when he was trying to dodge the point, suddenly clicked into place. Akane  frowned in concern, "You're saying she… you… did this for me?"</p><p>Ranma nodded once. "You and Mom," he clarified.</p><p>Akane sat in  stunned silence.</p><p>After a while, Ranma cleared his throat, "Of course, that  just creates a new problem." Akane tilted her head, waiting for him to go on,  unable to speak yet. Ranma sighed. "As soon as it's safe for me to meet Mom,  Pops and Mr. Tendo are going to rush us directly to a priest or something to  get us married and seal the deal permanently. Even with the curse, it was hard  to keep them from pushing, but really it was because of Mom they never pulled  it off. Mom would kill Pops if she missed the wedding. I am sure he thought me  being married would balance out the curse, prove me manly enough somehow that  she wouldn't force us to commit seppuku, but there still would have been hell  to pay for makin' her miss the big day."</p><p>"It occurred to me too," Akane finally spoke.</p><p>"I don't wanna be married, and I don't think you do  either…"</p><p>"I…" Akane tried to interrupt.</p><p>"It's not you, Akane. It's us," he cut her off. "For one  thing, we're way too young. We can hardly get along on a date, and there is no  way we could get married without Shampoo and Ukyo, or Kodachi, flipping out and  trying to stop it. Shampoo gave you the kiss of death, for cryin' out loud! If  I had not made it very clear that I would kill her if she tried to follow up on  that, she would have found some way of murdering you already."</p><p>Akane flinched. "You're kidding! You don't think she'd  dare…?"</p><p>Ranma sighed, "When she was after me, she was not jokin'  around, Akane. I don't think she's ever killed anyone before, and I don't know  if she could do it without hesitating. You didn't defeat her in combat, so she  can probably only act against you if you become an 'obstacle' and getting  married to me would guarantee that!"</p><p>Akane paused in thought.</p><p>"At least you only have the one engagement to worry  about, but you also have to deal with the mess I am in. It would be stupid to  rush ahead with all that up in the air," he complained.</p><p>"Did you really threaten Shampoo?"</p><p>"She knows how it is," he evaded. "It's one thing if  people try to kill me, I'm sorta getting used to it, an' it's not that  different from all the people chasin' after me for stuff that Pops or Happosai's  done. Threatenin' my friends or family, though, I'll never stand for that."</p><p>Akane decided not to press the question, and switched  tracks. "You say you accepted the engagement to me out of obligation to your  family. Out of honor. What about the other engagements?"</p><p>"People think it's just a matter of me picking the girl I  want," he snorted. "The fact is, there's usually someone else's honor somehow at  stake. The ones I could get out of I've dealt with as they've come up. For  some, all they had to do is see the curse in action, and they'd drop it. Then  there's the ones from stupid scams my old man pulled, but if no one was gonna  get hurt I could fight my way out of 'em. Some have been plain dumb, some jerk  fallin' all over himself to marry my girl side for one stupid reason or  another." Ranma scowled and brushed those aside with a wave of his hand. "Kodachi  is just plain crazy, and there will never be anything there. She's only around 'cuz  she keeps butting in. Ukyo…" he sighed.</p><p>"She's your friend, and your father took her dowry,"  Akane noted.</p><p>"Exactly. Pops totally dismissed her, but there's a debt  there I can't ignore. That is a matter of family honor, and I have to face it  since he won't. Shampoo, however,"  he  rolled his eyes, "she's a problem we both created, and I just don't know how to  deal with her. Apart from the fact she might actually kill anyone who gets in  her way, she does have honor at stake. She can't just walk away from me without  losing face, or worse."</p><p>"Do you… want any of us?' Akane asked timidly.</p><p>"I don't dare make a choice," Ranma shrugged. "If I  choose one, I offend the honor of the others. Since they're all arrangements to  satisfy honor, I don't have any choices to begin with. The point is, as long as  these other claims are valid, there's no honorable way our parents can force us  to get married. I can't get out of it, and you can't get out of it, but there's  a chance Ukyo and Shampoo will find other men to marry, and abandon their claim  to me. All we have to do is make our parents see that, and we have as long as  it takes for them to find someone else to figure out what to do about our  engagement."</p><p>Akane took careful note of the expression on Ranma's face  and realized he had been driving toward this from the beginning. This had been  some kind of plan that had evolved while Ranma was dealing with his father's  scheme to replace him. It did not take a genius to see that Genma had only been  concerned with pushing the marriage forward, using whatever means he could.  Going into detail about how conscious he had been of Akane being stuck with the  engagement, how the "cure" made it more likely they would be forced to marry  sooner, then finally coming up with a decent explanation for why he was  stringing all of his fiancées along, Ranma was "doing it all for her". It  worked for him, too, but he was proposing it to her, why else point out that  they were "on the same side"? It was a nice idea, if they both objected to the  marriage, to team up to postpone it inevitably, but there was one thing he had  missed. "Uh, I hate to ruin your plans, but they already have, I think."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"They're both after Ranma-chan," Akane pointed out.</p><p>"Oh no…" Ranma paled.</p><p>"Yeah, so what you were about to suggest, how we could  keep stalling our dads? I don't think that will work," Akane sighed.</p><p>Ranko studied Ryouga from  across the table, while her thoughts tumbled back to their arrival at the  restaurant. In spite of Nodoka's warning, they arrived with time to spare, so  while Ryouga waited, Nodoka ushered Ranko to the ladies room for a "chat". That  was enough to set the boy turned girl on edge, but Nodoka mistook her  nervousness for something else. Something she wanted to address before excusing  herself while the two of them ate. Because the lavatory was occupied when they  entered, she ushered Ranko into a stall and entered one herself. Since she had  no clue why Nodoka dragged her in there, she spent the next few minutes trying  to figure out how to go to the bathroom without getting completely undressed.  Finally deciding on the same solution that occurred to her for fighting in the  slinky outfit, she hiked the dress up around her waist, slipped her panties  down and tried her hardest to ignore the sounds emanating from the surrounding  stalls while she relieved herself. Fortunately, two women were going about  their business without a pause in their loud conversation. Unfortunately, the  topic of their conversation was one Ranko had never imagined two women would  speak so openly, and in great detail, about.</p><p>"And Akane thinks BOYS are perverts!" she huffed, her  face burning.</p><p>The distinct sound of Nodoka's laughter informed her that  her comment had not been as quiet as she thought. Soon enough, the scandalous conversation  drifted out the door, with the women who laughing over Ranko's comment. Ranko  slunk out of the stall to wash her hands, and found her mother waiting to talk  to her.</p><p>"Ranko-chan, I think those ladies have provided a perfect  excuse to bring up a topic I have been meaning to speak with you about," she  smiled, turning the faucet and quickly washing her own hands. Ranko whipped  around to stare at her in shock. Her mother wanted to talk to her about sex!  The terror must have shown in her eyes, since Nodoka began to laugh again. "Oh,  my! I can see you've never had to talk about this with anyone before. I would  have thought Kasumi might have taken you aside by now."</p><p>Ranko boggled even more. "Ka-Ka-Kasumi!" She swallowed.  She would have sworn, if anyone alive had been more oblivious about sex than  herself, it had to be sweet, innocent Kasumi.</p><p>Nodoka sighed, and offered a motherly smile. As intended  it did calm the girl down a bit. "I imagine that most of what you know about  sex comes from overhearing talk such as that. That is quite insufficient for a  well mannered lady. At your age, girls are quite susceptible to being taken  advantage of, by their own hormones and ignorance, as much as by the boys who  court them. A girl as pretty as yourself should not start dating without  certain knowledge and precautions, because, however well meaning, and however  unintentional, things can get quite sticky before you know it."</p><p>"Mo- Auntie Nodoka! I am NOT going to be sleeping with  Ryouga!" Ranko declared hotly. The very idea was frightening, worse because  even as she denied it, the idea set off all sorts of strange, compelling  feelings.</p><p>"Oh, Ranko-chan! I am sure you were not thinking of doing  that. While you seem to lack a certain feminine modesty, you are not entirely  lacking in common sense. A girl like yourself could not have been so close to a  boy such as my son without possessing a great deal of restraint. Just the same,  there's no magical curse to discourage you and Ryouga," she pointed out. "So, I  just want to make sure you are prepared."</p><p>"I, uh, really ain't- am not interested in mess- taking  risks with sex. The last thing I can deal with right now is being pregnant!"  she declared with conviction. She was glad Copy-chan had sorted out that  mystery before taking her experiments with "making love" too far!</p><p>"Quite so! I am glad to see you understand the  consequences of that! Too many girls, even today, grow up uninformed about the  simple basics of human reproduction. It's scandalous!" Nodoka shook the water  from her hands and dried them on a towel. Seeing Ranko had done the same, she  took a moment to help straighten the girl's dress and check her hair,  continuing, "Now, the first question is, have you been seen by a gynecologist?"</p><p>Ranko frowned. She was not too sure, but she seemed to  recall the Tendo sisters occasionally had appointments to see a gynecologist,  but the one time she asked what it was about, Nabiki had gotten a scary look on  her face, splashing her with cold water, and threatened to take "her" along to  find out for herself. At the time, anything that required being female to participate  in she objected to out of hand. "Uh, Nabiki sort of gave me the idea that I  really would not want to do that," she hedged.</p><p>Nodoka looked unexpectedly upset, "That girl! I never  expected she could be so irresponsible!"</p><p>"I don't- I am not even sure what a gynecologist is,"  Ranko intercepted, explaining, "She knew that, so she was just teasing me! I am  sure it's just, ah, something that she knew would make me really uncomfortable.  She probably meant no harm." Ranko could not believe she was defending Nabiki.  Even so, Nodoka still frowned and muttered something about having a talk with  the middle Tendo daughter.</p><p>"It is uncomfortable, to be sure, but it is a necessity  for women's health. Well then, it's safe to assume you have not started on  birth control," Nodoka sighed and began to fumble in her purse. She pulled out  a small black evening bag and handed it to Ranko. "I forgot to give this to you  earlier, but I didn't think you would have to carry anything on your date, with  me along." She reached into her purse again and pulled out a handful of foil  wrapped packages. Ranko recognized them by sight, having seen boys trading them  in the locker room at school. She handed all but one of them to Ranko, "Put  these in your purse, and make sure you have them handy at all times. Now, do  you know what a condom is for and how to use it?"</p><p>Ranko paled and then blushed. The answer to the question  was a resounding no, save for the fact that she could define the word in  context. She was positive she did not want to hear more on this subject, since  she already knew from Hiroshi and Daisuke that it figured intimately in the act  they fantasized about so avidly, which for her had only recently become  recognized as sex. Unable to speak, she shook her head.</p><p>Nodoka sighed. The poor girl REALLY needed a mother. "Don't  they have a sex education program at your school?" she asked in a pained voice.</p><p>Ranko blanched. Good Heavens! Did the actually teach THAT  at school! Swallowing painfully she blurted, "I hope not!"</p><p>Nodoka barely restrained herself from kissing the floor.  Clearly the girl had some notion what sex was, and completely the wrong idea  what sex education was. "I can see you and I have a few busy weekends ahead of  us, young lady. They do not teach children to have sex in school, if that's  what you are worried about," she corrected primly, eyebrows arched in chagrin. "At  the risk of shocking you, I am going to cover the basics, since this is the  only protection I can give you at the moment, aside from taking the pair of you  straight home."</p><p>Ranko groaned in despair. It had to be a nightmare!</p><p>It had been agonizing to stand through the lecture and  demonstration, trying not to wonder why her mother carried an object so well  suited to the lesson in her purse. It was bad enough that when she stared at it  her mother promised they would go shopping to buy Ranko one of her own, though  she winked and assured the girl she should figure out what to do with it on her  own. Once Nodoka was satisfied that Ranko understood how to apply this lesson  to a situation involving Ryouga, she led them out of the restroom and over to  the table where they spotted him waiting nervously. Ranko could not imagine how  he could possibly be as nervous as she, now. She also wondered why her dress  did not burst into flames from the heat of her furious blush. Even through  ordering and the arrival of their meal, her mind was haunted by what her mother  had caused her to envision. Poor Ryouga was so flustered by the way she was  staring at him, he had not managed to utter a single coherent word.</p><p>"Ryouga?" she finally asked.</p><p>"Ah! I… Um… Wh-wha- er… R-Ra-Ranko?" he stammered.</p><p>"What are you so nervous about?"</p><p>"Wh-why d-do you k-ke-keep LOOKING at me l-like y-you  wanna EAT m-me?" he heroically fought his way through the whole question.</p><p>Ranko blushed and tried to make a joke out of it, "Um.  They didn't have any pork items on the menu?" Ryouga flinched, his chopsticks  flung across the room as he recoiled away from her. She grinned. "Just kidding!  I mean it, I was just kidding!"</p><p>Ryouga glared at her hatefully.</p><p>Feeling absolutely horrid, remembering too late just how  traumatized he was by people's attempts—her own father's attempts!—to eat him,  and bowed her head. Clearing her throat, she confided, "Actually, I am sorta  freakin' out because my Mom just taught me how to use a condom." As intended,  that distracted him from her insult. The food he was chewing spurted out of his  mouth, spraying the man at the next table, as Ryouga convulsed in shock. From  the sound of it, the woman at the table behind Ranko had also done a spit-take  all over her date. At least she was laughing about it, Ryouga was too busy  keeling over in his chair with a resounding thud.</p>
