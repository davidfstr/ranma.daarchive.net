</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Twelve: The Mirror of Broken Souls</p><p>Under the deep, dark blue of  a Tokyo night, the ward of Nerima sprawled like a patchwork quilt stitched  together by tiny knots of light. The shrunken form of the Amazon Matriarch  attested to the price she had paid to conserve the vitality of her limbs and  the keenness of her senses through the onslaught of centuries. Thus, she felt  no apprehension bounding across the skyline through the treacherous darkness,  in her race to the Tendo Dojo. After promising her great-granddaughter that she  would investigate immediately, she had paused only to return to her room and  put away the sacred texts and dangerous artifacts by which she tended her  tangled web. Through the long months she had chaperoned her heir in her pursuit  of Ranma Saotome, she had kept her true interest in the cursed boy a secret. It  would not do to leave clues, however obscure, where either of her young charges  might stumble across them. It would be enough for them to learn of her thoughts  only after she had verified her suspicions or established them as false. If  what Shampoo had reported was true, she might know the answer sooner than she  had anticipated.</p><p>It  all came down to finding a situation that forced young Saotome to yield to his  female condition and unlock the part of his psyche that his father had beaten  into submission. After the Cat's Tongue incident, Cologne had realized that Saotome  could not be forced to embrace femininity, and the Chisuiiton incident had only  underscored this. No, as long as there was a hope for his male mind to cling  to, the boy would resist the very thought of being a girl. For fear of what  might happen if there was no hope in such a situation, Cologne had not  attempted to do what she now feared had been done.</p><p>Oh, she would gladly shatter his masculine psyche. The  trick was finding a way to do it that would not spur him to suicide. Or cause  his foolish mother to demand his sacrifice to preserve the honor of his  honorless family. What curse lay upon that family that their devotion to honor  only manifested in self-destructive forms? Why did they not respect that honor  enough to avoid such stupid, wasteful situations.</p><p>"Ah, but if their honor was sound and sane, I could not  have manipulated this situation to my own ends. And who am I so speak of honor  when I use my own, dear Shampoo as my cat's paw?" Cologne chided herself as the  dojo came into view. From the light spilling from the windows, it was clear  that the inhabitants were awake yet. Making her way around to the guest room  window, she perched in the eves and began to spy on Genma and his son. Cologne  sighed. With all they had invested in the boy, there was no question that they  would go to any expense to preserve his masculine image. Instant Nannichaun  would have the same effects on a victim of a locked curse that it would have on  a normal person, enduring until the subject was exposed to hot water. An  unlocked curse would reverse the instant version at the application of hot or  cold water. Combined with Waterproof Soap, and Ranma would remain man enough to  fulfill their demands of him.</p><p>From the looks on their faces, she had arrived in the  wake of some bitter argument, or unpleasant lecture. The boy looked suspicious  and defiant, while Genma was stern with patriarchal anger.</p><p>"Whatever the circumstances, you are my son, Boy. The  closest I have to a true son now, and I am obligated to remind you that you owe  everything you possess, ultimately, to me," Genma broke the silence.</p><p>"You're just tryin' to get out of that stupid agreement!"  the boy accused. "This is an unforgivable thing to do to your own son, just to  save your own worthless hide, and I won't go along with it!"</p><p>"Don't talk back to me, Boy! Are you forgetting that your  'life' would end at the end of the week if I did not offer you this chance!"</p><p>"Damn you! I can't forget! But if the choice is between  ceasin' to exist and sacrificin' my own honor to survive, it really isn't a  choice. Forcin' <i>me</i> on Akane, and goin' through with this stupid marriage  is even worse! Did you even think about how <i>she'd</i> feel about this plan?"</p><p>"How she feels does not matter. It is her duty, as it is  yours."</p><p>Cologne narrowed her eyes. She had suspected the boy  cared for the Tendo girl, but she would have put it past him to show this much  concern for her feelings. Things were definitely coming to a head! She  stiffened suddenly as she felt two well-concealed presences approaching over  the roof. She pressed her tiny form deeper into the shadow of the eves, bracing  herself between two of the exposed beams as the couple paused on the edge above  her. There was a whispered argument between them, that voiceless hissing that  obscured all identifying traits.</p><p>"You already know what they're talkin' about. Why even  bother spyin'?"</p><p>"Who says I'm not here to just kill that mangy bastard!"</p><p>"Can I help?"</p><p>"Get in line," the speaker leaned over the gutter,  anchoring her feet and allowed herself to dangle outside the window. She was  joined almost immediately by her partner. As the light spilling from the window  caught their faces, Cologne almost dropped out of the shadows in shock. There  was no mistaking the distinctive features of onna-Ranma, but even with Cologne's  incredible depth of experience, there were few possible explanations for there  to be two of her in the same place at the same time. None of which could  explain how she—they—could be spying on a third of their ilk through the  window. The matriarch's eyes narrowed. It had been many generations since she  had been as thoroughly shocked as this.</p><p>"It looks like he's thinking of killing him for us," the  first onna-Ranma commented after a second.</p><p>The other girl laughed softly. "Did you ever imagine you'd  get the chance to watch yourself kill your old man?"</p><p>"Don't laugh. I've never been this angry at him. After  everything he's done, this is the one thing I can't forgive," the girl growled  dangerously. Inside the two forms had sprung into action. "Dammit! If he kills  Pops before I teach him a lesson, I'm gonna wring his neck!"</p><p>Cologne watched the other girl grab the first and  restrain her.</p><p>"He won't. He only angry, not homicidal, like you! If you  go in there, Kasumi will be up all night mopping blood out of the guest room,"  she tried to sound reasonable. The other girl shook with rage but subsided.</p><p>"I should have known, the minute he stepped out of the  mirror, that my old man would come up with this!" she snarled after a moment.</p><p>Cologne's eyes grew even wider. She squinched them shut  for fear they would drop right out of her skull and splat into the upside-down  girls' faces. There was only one mirror she knew of with the power to clone  human beings. As far as she knew, it had been lost at sea over a thousand years  ago. By whatever perverse luck the Mirror of Broken Souls might have been  recovered from the depths of the ocean, its powers should at least still have  been sealed! Trust Ranma to find it and break the seal! This was by far a more  serious situation than what her great-granddaughter had reported to her!</p><p>"Son-in-law!" she announced her presence. "Are you saying  you have been duplicated by the Mirror of Broken Souls!"</p><p>"Gaaaaaaaaaah!"<br/>"Kyaaaaaaaaaa!"</p><p>The two girls dropped from the gutter to the ground  below, too surprised by Cologne's voice to flip and brace for the impact. Two  meaty thwacks echoed up, followed by moans and complaints. "What didja do that  for! Crazy old hag!"</p><p>Cologne, having dropped after them, arrived with two  resounding cracks to their skulls. "Such poor manners, in stereo no less!" She  glared at them and bounced back to balance on her staff. "Now, answer my  question."</p><p>"Mirror of Broken Souls? Is that a big oval mirror, about  two stories tall with an ornate frame?" Ranma-chan asked, rubbing her head.</p><p>"The man at Mirror Mansion never mentioned that it had a  name," Copy-chan murmured, doing the same. "All he talked about was how the  ghost of that dead noble woman possessed the mirror and uses it to steal people's  reflections so she can search for true love."</p><p>Cologne stared at them. "First, that is, unfortunately, a  fair description of the Mirror of Broken Souls. Secondly, don't be ridiculous.  If people's ghosts had the power to enchant items with such dangerous abilities  there would not be an object on this planet that was safe for people to use!"</p><p>The two girls stared at her for a moment before  Ranma-chan challenged, "So, you're tellin' us that the man from Mirror Mansion  lied to us?"</p><p>"Oh, I am sure he told you as much as he knew. The mirror  has a long history, and great lengths were taken to ensure that as few people  as possible knew of any of it," the elder assured them.</p><p>"So naturally, you know all about it," Ranma-chan  sneered.</p><p>"Say, who is this old mummy, anyway?" Copy-chan asked  her.</p><p>Cologne bashed her in the head and huffed in indignation.  "If you were a proper copy of the original, you'd already know who I am, and  you'd still be as obnoxious and disrespectful!" She composed herself and  thought. While she knew the legends of the mirror, she did not know enough to  explain what she was seeing. In the legends, only one cursed individual had  been exposed to the mirror, and his fate had not been accurately reported. All  she did know was that only a cursed person could produce more than one  reflected aspect. Now, the same had clearly happened with Ranma.</p><p>"Having seen the boy upstairs, I presume you," she  pointed at Ranma-chan, "are the original. She," she indicated Copy-chan, "mentioned  that a ghost possessed the mirror and somehow interferes with it. At least that  would explain why she does not remember me. I believe I would have to  investigate personally to determine what has really happened, but I can tell  you this. Because you have been split into your component aspects, you are in  great danger, Ranma."</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"You didn't ask why the mirror was called the Mirror of  Broken Souls," Cologne pointed out. "I can also see from your reaction that you  only suspected that she was truly part of yourself."</p><p>"But she's a girl!" Ranma-chan protested. "I mean, right  from the start she was chasing guys and wearing dresses and lingerie. I'm not  like that!"</p><p>Cologne studied the two for a moment. What a perfect  opportunity to point out something that had thus far eluded the cursed boy. "Of  course she's a girl. She doesn't have any reason to deny what she is. Unlike  you, with all that garbage you got from your parents!"</p><p>Ranma-chan puffed up in anger, "Just because my curse  turns me into a girl doesn't mean I am one! I am sick of you people tellin' me  that!"</p><p>As Ranma-chan lost her  temper, and her aura flared into the visible spectrum, Cologne's eyes narrowed  in scrutiny. What she saw forced her to set aside the question of Ranma's  femininity for the moment. Absorbed in reading the cursed boy's aura, she  unconsciously voiced concerned disapproval under her breath. After several  moments, with Cologne humming and hawing in contemplation, the two girls became  curious. At one point, Cologne's gaze wandered from Ranma-chan to Copy-chan,  then back to Ranma. Finally, she looked up, and launched herself back up to the  guest room window. With a sigh, she dropped back to the ground and cleared her  throat.</p><p>"As I feared, energy is bleeding away from you and your  duplicates," she announced.</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"Let us go inside and sit down to discuss this," Cologne  suggested, hopping on her staff around to the screened entrance to the Tea  Room. Both girls followed in dreadful anticipation. Once they were all seated  at the low table, Cologne began to tell them the legend of the mirror. "As you  may know, there is a spring in Jusenkyo called the Chaunshontsuniichaun, Spring  of Drowned Twins. This happens to be one of the trickier cursed springs because  it is the closest to having a permanent, natural result. Cold water splits an  individual into two perfect copies of the original, but hot water can only  reverse the curse if both individuals are in skin-to-skin contact when it is  applied. The tragedy of this particular curse is that the twined person ends up  in a conflict with herself over her original identity.</p><p>"In spite of this, there have been many seduced by the  prospect of being in two places at once who have been tempted to seek this  curse, or its effects," she continued. "Eleven or twelve hundred years ago, a  powerful Chinese emperor fell prey to this temptation, but felt that the water  triggers were too unpredictable. He commanded his court sorcerers to find a way  to harness the magic of the spring in a way that eliminated this flaw. Their  solution was to create a mirror using sand dredged from the  Chaunshontsuniichaun. As required, the mirror had the power to duplicate anyone  who gazed into the it. Unfortunately, the techniques used to harness the magic  were unknowingly flawed. Unlike the spring, which produced two whole  individuals, the mirror caused the essence of those who looked into it to be  divided between the original and the reflection. Worse, as the distance between  the reflection and the original increased, straining the constant flow of ki  between them, the vital energy would bleed out of them.</p><p>"This is what caused the mirror to become known as the  Mirror of Broken Souls. Given enough time, the division would cause its victims  to spiritually bleed to death," the matriarch explained in a mix of anger and  sadness. "Over the course of generations, the mirror claimed the lives of  countless rulers and heroes. In some cases, the twins fought over their identity,  and when one died, the other swiftly followed. In other cases, the two went separate  ways and suddenly sickened and died after a couple of weeks. It took a long  time for the curse of the mirror to become understood, since those who used it  tended to do so in secrecy. A special frame was created and bound to the mirror  to seal its power, when it was discovered that the mirror was indestructible.  In spite of this, it remained a potential danger, so it was placed on a ship  that was sailed to the high seas and sunk."</p><p>The two girls stared on in shock. "Are you sure it's the  same mirror?"</p><p>"I would have to see it for myself to be sure," Cologne  admitted.</p><p>"But if it is, then my copies will eventually kill me?"</p><p>"It is possible, Son-in-law. Your curse, however, might  alter things."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"There is a legend that tells of an individual, cursed  much like yourself, who used the mirror. Like you, he was able to produce more  than one reflection, and while the legend goes on to say that he simply  disappeared without a trace, there are other tales that suggest that the  reflections survived," Cologne confided. "His particular curse was to turn into  a young boy, and there are accounts of encounters with the two posing as father  and son during the next twenty years. From those stories, it is possible to  presume that being split into separate aspects cured him. Under the proper  circumstances, the same thing can happen using water from the  Chaunshontsuniichaun or a special magical incense burner. All three are  potential cures few cursed individuals have been brave enough to risk."</p><p>Ranma-chan was thunderstruck. Then she was angry, "You  mean to say that you've known all along at least three ways to cure me and you  never mentioned it!"</p><p>"Now, don't be hasty, Son-in-law. I point out that I have  never confirmed any of these potential cures, and from what I can see they all  have a dangerous and painful price."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"What these 'cures' all have in common is that they split  the victim into permanently cured and permanently cursed incarnations. Each one  with the same mind as the original. At the very least, the cursed half becomes  suicidal, but as often as not they try to take revenge on the cured half. It's  hardly an ideal solution!"</p><p>Copy-chan, listening to all of this, spoke up, "But, I'm  perfectly fine with being a girl. I mean, technically, I already am the  permanently cursed half, but I'm perfectly happy with the way I am. Apart from  being alone, that is."</p><p>"Ah, but something went wrong with you, and I presume  your counterpart," Cologne pointed out. "You two have no conscious memory of  being Ranma. I can tell just by observing you that you possess his skill and  character, probably his weaknesses too. The rest is buried and locked away."</p><p>"Uh," Ranma-chan was frowning, "It also sounds like, with  this 'cure' I have to die while they get to take over my life!"</p><p>"That is very observant, Son-in-law. Truly, you are in  dire peril."</p><p>Copy-chan looked on in growing alarm. She remembered  Ranma-chan telling her that when she became intimate with her other half, it  caused Ranma to feel like she was being torn in half. In a timid voice, she  quickly explained her compulsion and Ranma's ultimate objection to their  efforts to fulfill it. "Is it possible that makin' out or having sex would  literally tear Ranma-chan in half?"</p><p>Cologne, after swallowing her eyeballs back into her  head, tried to puzzle that one over. She knew, better than most, how much spiritual  energy was invested in intercourse, and it made sense that as the copies became  aroused they drew yin and yang in opposite directions away from Ranma. Cologne  stood up and spoke with all her formidable authority, "I would strongly  recommend that the two of you avoid any kind of intimate activity if you value  the life of Ranma Saotome!"</p><p>"Like they can stop themselves," Ranma-chan grumbled,  feeling doomed. She leaned forward, resting her forehead on the table and  sighed. Strangely enough, she had recognized at once the danger of either copy  dying. It had been clear in Cologne's story that when a victim killed his  duplicate, he inflicted a mortal wound upon himself. Her debt to Akane and  Ryouga suddenly tripled. "Hell, we're lucky we haven't all killed each other  already!"</p><p>Copy-chan looked down at her hands in her lap. "Would…  would the threat to Ranma be erased if we both went back into the mirror?"</p><p>Cologne was deeply absorbed in her thoughts, wrestling  with her conscience, when she heard the question. She allowed her gaze to  travel between the two girls while she tried to decide how to answer. Allowing  Ranma to be divided was an ideal solution to her problem, but she could not  look at Ranma-chan and condemn her so easily to death. The child had  accomplished so much, impressed her so frequently, that she had become  genuinely attached to Ranma. With a sigh, she finally answered, "Theoretically,  the damage caused by the mirror would be undone if the reflections returned to  it. It is a tough call to make, considering how desperately Son-in-law desires  a cure. I imagine that there is a reason why you were not both returned  immediately, so perhaps there is time to test some things before we resort to  that option. After all, that would be trading two deaths for one. How morbidly  ironic."</p><p>"What sort of tests?"</p><p>"Well, for one, we should see if we can get the copies to  remember being you," she responded to Ranma-chan's question. What she kept to  herself was her intention to see if she could get one of them to remember being  someone else altogether.</p><p>In the morning, the entire  household was shocked to find Cologne, flanked by the exhausted forms of  Shampoo and Mousse, waiting for them at the breakfast table. Her appearance was  enough to even cause Genma to suspend his plans to announce his intentions to  shift the engagement with Akane to Ranma's copy, or rather, officially replace  Ranma with his "true son". Because Cologne had roused Shampoo and Mousse and  prepared a large breakfast for the Tendo family to ease their intrusion into  the dojo at such an early hour, even Kasumi was able to take a place at the  table to hear what the matriarch had to say. The last two to come to the table  were Ranma-chan and Copy-chan in rumpled pajamas. The dark circles under their  eyes, and their haunted expressions, combined with their utter lack of surprise  at the presence of the guests, boded ill for the meeting. The fact that they  slumped at the table and did not even try to join Copy-kun in a mad grab for  food, was enough to turn the other's confusion into genuine alarm.</p><p>Kasumi's cheerful greeting to the amazons remained the  only utterance of the morning until Genma turned to the matriarch and cleared  his throat.</p><p>"Well, old woman, what nonsense brings you here this  morning?"</p><p>"Polite as ever, Genma," she frowned. "Since you prefer  to be blunt, so shall I. Following Shampoo's visit last night, I felt compelled  to come here and investigate the latest folly to befall Son-in-law. To my  regret, I discovered that your son is in peril of his life. Not too surprising,  Genma, the fault for his new condition is ultimately yours."</p><p>Genma scowled at her but did not deign to respond.</p><p>Rather than continue to goad the worthless father, she  proceeded to tell the legend of the Mirror of Broken Souls, repeating what she  had told the twin onna-Ranmas the night before. As the tale started, with  mention of the Spring of Drowned Twins, there were a few comments of  recognition. As she proceeded to tell of the mirror's creation, most of their  faces showed anticipation of how this mirror came to produce Copy-chan and  Copy-kun. As she spoke of the mirror's fatal flaw, Copy-kun suddenly lost his  appetite while the others stared at the copies with mixed emotions. No one  wanted to look at Ranma-chan. When Cologne mentioned the hypothetical use of  the mirror as a cure for a Jusenkyo curse, along with the shortcomings cures of  that nature had, Genma and Soun shook off their confusion and began to  celebrate. Everyone else had to jump on top of Ranma-chan to keep her from  killing the pair of them.</p><p>"Is that all the matters to you!" the girl screamed from  the bottom of the pile. "You'd have me die so that imposter can take my place  and fulfill your stupid schemes!"</p><p>"You ungrateful child! You would put your own survival  over the honor of our two families!" Genma retorted, as Soun restrained him.</p><p>"Why not! You do it all the time, Pop!"</p><p>"Both of you, just stop it!" Akane yelled. In a calmer  voice she turned to Cologne, looking out from her position in the dog pile. "So  what you're saying is, the only solution to this is for Ranma, or his copies,  to die!"</p><p>"In effect, that is correct. The original can only  survive in the copies cease to exist. If they continue to exist, the original  will be destroyed."</p><p>"Shampoo so so sad. Is terrible tragedy!" the purple  haired amazon wiggled out of the pile to get away from Mousse, who seemed to be  rather conveniently sprawled over her.</p><p>"I too feel that such a 'cure' is too horrible to  contemplate!" Mousse declared, as he struggled out of the pile and straightened  his robes.</p><p>"Are you absolutely sure!" Akane demanded.</p><p>"Yes, child, I am afraid so. From what I understand, you  intended to force the copies to return to the mirror, where they can no longer  exist as independent beings. All I have revealed is that Son-in-law also faces  oblivion should this circumstance be exploited as a cure. For the individuals  in question, there is no question that this is a matter of life and death.  Moreover, the decision as to who shall meet their end can only be decided by  them."</p><p>"If the copies are really such a danger, why hasn't Ranma  been harmed already?" Nabiki asked calmly.</p><p>"Simply put, Ranma has remained in close proximity to his  copies, minimizing the amount of spiritual bleeding. To say he has been  unharmed, however, would be remiss. I understand that the copies are compelled  to somewhat amorous extremes and have been indulging each other to sate themselves.  Yesterday, before lunch, according to Copy-chan, Ranma was struck down by the  sight of them 'making out' as she put it. The energy that sustains them all  flows between them, and if any individual makes too great a demand on that  energy it leaves the others drained or depleted."</p><p>"Uh, wait! Hinnako is constantly draining Ranma's aura.  Is that any different than what happens between these three?"</p><p>"That's actually an astute observation, Akane. What is  happening to this trio is precisely the same as having a chi vampire constantly  sucking energy off of them. In the case of that delinquent teacher, there are  limits to the amount of energy she can leech by force making it unlikely that  she would be able to kill one of her victims with any given attack. However, if  the energy is freely available, she could soak up the chi of an entire city."  Cologne frowned. "Honestly, with these three bleeding like this, she could  accidentally kill them with her lowest level attack."</p><p>"Ranma, you're not going to school!" Akane, Nabiki,  Copy-chan and Copy-kun shouted. The news itself had distracted Ranma-chan from  her impulse to murder Genma. She stared at Cologne.</p><p>"You're kiddin', right!"</p><p>"No. I would heed the advice of your… uh…" there was no  word to categorize the group that was sitting on top of Ranma-chan. "Do try to  avoid Miss Hinnako. I would recommend that you have people around who can deal  with her if she seeks you out."</p><p>"What about Happosai?" Ranma-chan asked. "He tried to  leech chi off all three of us the first night. Why didn't that hurt us?"</p><p>Cologne laughed, "Though I often feel that man is a  demon, he is no vampire. He can pull off latent ki, such as lingers on people's  clothing, but he certainly has not risked the modifications that would allow  him to feed on chi as his protégé does. The essence he gathers is akin to dead  hair and skin, naturally shed from the 'body' of his victims' ki."</p><p>"Oh," Ranma-chan frowned. Sitting up, casually shedding  the pile of bodies on top of her, she became thoughtful. "It seems to me that,  as I've developed my chi, I've gotten a lot better at dealing with Hinnako's  leeching. I would think that if I worked at it, I should be able to do  something about this bleeding. I mean, if I can actually limit what she can  take from me, and control it for my attacks, it seems logical enough that I  could fix this."</p><p>Cologne studied him. She had given up on underestimating  his ability when it came to the mechanics of his Art. It was one of the reasons  she had been hopeful that he was Fa Shen reborn. She had been a genius at the  Art, particularly when it came to using chi to harm or heal. She was still,  short of the royal line of the Musk, the youngest individual to ever master chi  techniques. "You would have to work with your copies to attempt such a thing,  and I cannot say how liable you are to succeed. If it were anyone else, I might  say such an endeavor was impossible. You will have to learn a few things more  suited to the practice of medicine and healing than martial arts, but you have  a sufficient base to start. We will include that, along with trying to tap the  memory of your copies, to the things we must pursue while waiting for the  mirror's seal to be repaired."</p><p>Genma looked at the three Ranmas as they huddled  together. He cleared his throat, "Ranma. I understand you feel that I have  dishonored you by presenting Copy-kun as my true son." Ranma-chan slowly turned  hate filled eyes on her father. When her old man had the dignity to blanch and  swallow hard, she allowed him to continue speaking. "I simply remind you that  there are reasons, above and beyond my own well being, which necessitate my  decision. For one, I have deeply regretted that the nature of your curse had  made it necessary to hide from your mother. She does not deserve it, and while  I do fear for our lives should she find your condition unmanly, I also fear  that upon completing her role in our execution, she would feel compelled to  take her own life." Genma took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes for a  moment.</p><p>Ranma sucked in a sharp breath as Genma disguised his  tears. Her father would weep crocodile tears to guilt trip her, but was quick  to disguise genuine emotion. She said nothing as his damp fingers came away  from his red, swollen eyes.</p><p>"It also occurred to me that returning your copies to the  mirror would be no different from killing them. I am a harsh man at times, but  I am not a killer. Is it so unreasonable then, to look at this perfect boy, see  in him a son that any mother and father could be proud of, and know that he  could be the solution to all our problems?" Genma sighed. "Finally, you have  voiced nothing but complaint against your engagement to Akane. While I truly  hoped you would come to love the daughter of my good friend and ally, I cannot  ignore that here is a boy longing for love, with no other hope for life. I put  him in your place not just for me, but for you, for him, and most of all for my  beloved Nodoka."</p><p>"But at the same time, you've pushed me aside like some  worn out rag!" Ranma-chan cried, just managing to voice more outrage than  grief. Even now, she could not bear to show how deeply wounded she was by her  father's betrayal.</p><p>"I would have thought you'd be glad to rid yourself of  me, of this engagement. I've watched you try and throw everything away on the  hope of finding some cure. From the moment you fell into that pool, you have  lost your respect for me, so who cast aside who first?" Genma challenged.</p><p>Ranma-chan subsided into shocked silence.</p><p>"It does not matter now. There can only be one Ranma  Saotome, and this boy is better suited. It does not mean you are not my child,  or that I would prefer to see you dead. Still, you're a fool if you don't  understand that I am always willing to risk your life for the sake of the Art  and for family honor, and that is not going to change now, just because you are  as much a daughter as a son. Do not challenge my decision unless you truly mean  to uphold the responsibilities that come with your name!" Genma declared with  uncommon authority.</p><p>Ranma-chan's mind was still stuck on the "as much a  daughter as a son" comment. Did even her own father see her as a girl? Did her misogynistic  old man feel some impulse to be unforgivably soft on her because in some part  of his warped mind he had gained a daughter? Was this whole notion of his some  warped way of going easy on her, giving her a way out of all her responsibilities  as a man? In a strangled voice she demanded, "Am I a son or a daughter to you?"</p><p>"I am waiting to learn that from you. At least now you  can afford to consider the question."</p><p>"What the hell brought this on!"</p><p>"Son," Genma sagged, "When your mother is here, all I can  do is watch and listen. I can't tell you how many times she's sat down beside  me, Mr. Panda, watching you fighting with Akane, or working out in the yard,  and wished aloud that you were her daughter."</p><p>"What!"<br/>"Your mother always wanted a  daughter. When we married, she told me she might not be able to have children,  but if she could, she hoped for a daughter, like the one she had in her dreams.  Of course, we both wanted, needed a son. For her, it was a requirement of her  father's, for me, I needed a son to fulfill my pact with Tendo-kun," he sighed.  "But Nodoka still only wished for a daughter. If you were that daughter, she  would accept you with no strings attached. But that is only possible if you are  not Ranma, do you understand?"</p><p>Cologne looked on, almost unable to contain herself.</p>
