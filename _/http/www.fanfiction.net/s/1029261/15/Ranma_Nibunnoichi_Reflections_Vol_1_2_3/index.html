</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Fifteen: I Am He as You Are Me or He Is She and  We Are All Together</p><p>The first indication the  morose trio had of impending rain was the sudden burst of motion from Ryouga.  Responding to the first acrid tang of moisture on the wind, Ryouga reached over  his shoulder and pulled his umbrella free of the restraints binding it to the  top of his backpack. The force of the draw, as he whipped it around in an arc  with his left hand, snapped it open. Ranma, currently in triplicate, snapped  into reflexive guard positions and scanned the forest bordering the road,  instantly ready if Ryouga happened to be preparing for battle. The umbrella  spun in the lost boy's grip as he jerked it upright just in time to intercept  the first fat drops aiming at his head. Cologne, who happened to have been  riding atop the umbrella laden pack at the start of this maneuver, had been  launched at a nearby tree, bounced from the trunk down to the path and back up  onto the backpack just in time to perch in its shadow, safe from the deluge  that followed. Instinctively, all three Ranmas hunched a bit and grabbed at  their clothing, expecting their pants to begin sliding down after the  transformation, though this reflex was only necessary for one of them.</p><p>The boy who had just become a girl automatically gathered  her pants and tightened her belt around her narrow waist. The girl who had not  changed simply confirmed that her oversized outfit was properly secured. Both  of them were glaring at the boy who paused in the midst of checking himself,  and began chuckling at the unnecessary reflex. When he smiled and leaned back  to welcome the rain on his face, the two girls swallowed a growl and suddenly  bounded off down the road in great, land devouring leaps. Spurred on by  identical stabs of pain, they were almost blind to each other, until each  noticed who was pacing her so effortlessly.</p><p>Turning to each other with equal looks of shock, they  dropped out of their frenetic pace and lurched to a walk about a quarter of a  mile ahead of the others. For a moment, they found themselves unable to speak,  for the simple reason that the moment had put them into synch. They both opened  their mouths to speak at the same time, and hesitated, biting their lips to  gesture for the other to speak. For a moment, they mirrored each other,  studying each other's face, reading their inner thoughts and feelings in the  other's expressions. At the same time, they looked the other in the eye and  began chuckling.</p><p>"Okay," they said together, "this is really weird!"</p><p>Sharing a look of surprise, they each took a step back  and pointed, "Hey, how are you doin' that?" They frowned at each other, then  started laughing. Even their laughter, interspersed with gasps for air, seemed  to synch up, causing them to laugh even harder, until they fell forward into  each other and slumped to their knees feeling light headed.</p><p>When they regained their breath, they leaned back on  their heels and studied each other again. "Do you… uh… are you thinkin'… you  are!" they both  gaped as their thoughts  sped down the same track faster then they could even put them into words. "But,  why?" they both demanded, challenging some unspoken statement. "Right, so…  Damn, this is confusing," they interrupted themselves. At the same time they  impulsively reached out to touch each other's faces. With a start, they  realized the reflection was not mirror perfect, they each had their right hand  cupped to the other's left cheek. Their thumbs traced over a faint, hairline  scar on the other's cheek in thought.</p><p>"It's not a mirror image. This would be on the other  cheek if it was," they both murmured. "I didn't notice that before…" Their  hands dropped to rest on top of their thighs. They looked at each other, letting  their thoughts progress a bit further. "Okay, so… we are the same person. I  guess it makes sense that we'd think and act the same," they pointed out. "Why  wasn't it like this from the start? What brought this on?"</p><p>They looked inward trying to determine when the  synchronicity had started. They remembered the moment when the copies minds had  been joined to Ranma's by the mirror. When the copies… no, the reflections, had  come back out of the mirror, they had been the same person in three different  situations. They had each taken a unique perspective on the situation because  of how they were in relation to the curse. For all they might think and act the  same, the different circumstances they were in required them to think on  different angles. "Somehow, we jumped onto the same track," they mused aloud.  "When it started raining, when I watched him… Of course. How could I still be a  girl and see that without getting upset?" they noted painfully, looking down.</p><p>"Okay, so, how do we stop it?" they asked a moment later.  Once asked, it seemed obvious enough. The only thing that kept them from  actually being the same person was being in different places. Or, more  accurately, different states or situations. The most significant difference  being that one of them was permanently a girl. Looking up, they both said,  "Ranko…"</p><p>/ "…I have to start thinking of myself as Ranko."</p><p>\ "…you have to start thinking of yourself as Ranko."</p><p>Though they had spoken at the same time, the difference  was instantly apparent. "Well, that seems to work," they echoed. "Damn. That's  not enough." They frowned at each other. Still, that was a good place to begin.  Since Ranko was entirely a girl, they could use that to establish precedence  for speaking. By Japanese tradition, usually the male took precedence.</p><p>/ "I'm only a part-time guy, so I guess it's him, then  me, then you."</p><p>\ "You're only a part time guy, so I guess it's him, then  you, then me."</p><p>They laughed together for a bit. Squeezing tears of mirth  from their eyes, they muttered, "Oh, this is wild. Akane'd just freak out if  she heard us!" More laughter ensued. "Okay, so it's a little harder to do than  to say," they admitted together. Concentrating, one girl raised an eyebrow at  the other, who nodded. Taking a deep breath, the girl with the active curse  rose to her feet.</p><p>"Good, it works with actions," she said.</p><p>The other girl got to her feet, "I was just about to say  that…"</p><p>"I know. I suppose it's a good thing…" she cut herself  off.</p><p>"I was thinking that too. I'm not happy about being stuck  as a girl, but…" she shrugged. "You're right, if not for that we would have  been stuck like that for a while."</p><p>"It's…"</p><p>"Please, don't say it," Ranko interrupted. "I know it's  not as bad as before. I just… for me it isn't a choice. I'm glad I don't have  that contract hanging over my head, but I still don't feel like jumping into a  dress and chasing Ryouga!"</p><p>"At least that never happened when I was in my right  mind," Ranma-chan sighed. Taking a deep breath and seeing the rest of their  party closing on them, she focused on Ryouga. "I'm glad it didn't go too far,  either. I feel bad enough as it is."</p><p>Ranko nodded, her eyes focused on the lost boy as well.  "I think I am going to miss Copy-chan. It was a lot simpler for her," she  sighed. Intellectually, she knew that she had been Copy-chan, but with all of  Ranma's memories, there was only enough of that innocent girl left to keep her  from screaming against her fate.</p><p>"It's also a lot more complicated because of her."</p><p>"I didn't think you'd admit that," Ranko looked at her  twin.</p><p>Ranma-chan's eyes traveled over to the other boy. "Yeah,  well, because of him, it's even more complicated. Now that he remembers me…"  she cut herself off and swallowed. "Now that he is Ranma, all I have is a  curse, and a whole lot of uncomfortable questions to answer. I'm just glad he's  not Copy-kun."</p><p>"Ah, yeah," Ranko gulped, picking up on Ranma-chan's  train of thought. "That isn't likely to happen again, but he'll still have the  same effect on you." The approaching figures were staring back at them  curiously, but before they came into ear shot, Ranko quickly added, "I know you  had already decided we would take over as Ranma and Ranko. I know you feel like  there isn't much left for you, hell, I have no idea what we'll even call you  now…" She paused. Ranma's memories had made two things very clear. On a  physical level, the curse made it far easier for her twin to be female. Cold  water was much more common, and it would be easier to make the curse permanent  than to cure it. On a mental level, it was far easier for her twin, for any of  them, to be male. Sighing, she completed her warning, "Don't chose what is  easiest. You have all the options, so think about what you want and fight for  it, Ranma."</p><p>The other girl laughed somewhat eerily. "Even if it means  fighting myself?" she asked pointedly. The others had finally caught up to them  and looked between the girls curiously. The conclusion of their conversation  was cryptic enough, but none of them wanted to probe. "It's about time you slow  pokes caught up."</p><p>"Ah, impetuous youth," Cologne sighed.</p><p>As the twin girls fell into step with the others, they  quickly described what had happened to them when they ran off. In the process  of explaining their synchronization, they repeatedly fell into it, subjecting  the others to the eerie stereo effect. They also explained their solution,  distinguishing Ranma and Ranko and establishing their precedence in moments of  confusion. Cologne noted that she had expected them to experience moments of  synchronicity. She warned Ranma and Ranko that even with differing forms, they  might experience it, so it was good they had come up with a system for all  three to deal with it. The only problem, naturally, was what to call the  original Ranma.</p><p>"Geez, it was bad enough I had to come up with Ranko,"  the cursed girl sighed. "No offense," she turned to the girl who now bore that  name.</p><p>"None taken. I understand perfectly," she assured,  glaring at Ranma.</p><p>"How about, 'Saotome'?" Ranma asked Ranma-chan.</p><p>"Nah, I'd think someone was talking about Pop. Yeah," she  cut off the protest that she knew was coming, "I know it's common to just go by  a family name, but that won't distinguish me from either of you." She walked  between her twins in thoughtful silence for a while. Because of her father,  this was unavoidable. The best 'son' had to be Ranma, for too many reasons. She  had assumed other names and guises, usually to mess with Ryouga. The name Ranko  had been invented to cover for the slip she had made during her mother's first  visit, when she almost used her real name. For the same reason she could not be  Ranma, she could not be Ranko. Not unless she intended to be a girl for the  rest of her life. There was no point for her to fight for either identity.</p><p>Except that if she did not, she feared she would lose any  sense of identity she had left. The very idea left her feeling uncentered,  dissipated. She studied her feelings. She would have thought that not being  Ranma would be the most shattering blow. It had certainly hurt to pose as  Akane's cousin. Ranko was pure fiction, yet now the identity seemed to hold as  much substance as that of Ranma. Why was that? She stopped, scrunching her face  to concentrate on the elusive impressions inside her. There was something, her  instincts were whispering it tauntingly. She turned around and opened her eyes.  She found herself facing Ranma. She looked up into his face, ignoring his  startled and confused expression.</p><p>Ranko narrowed her eyes and walked up behind her. Feeling  the girl closing, Ranma-chan turned and held out her arms. Her hand caught  Ranko on the shoulder, while the other pressed against Ranma's chest. In that  position, the thread connecting them to each other was eclipsed by her body,  which suddenly hummed like a power line. Cologne hopped down from Ryouga's pack  and perched on her staff in front of the cursed girl.</p><p>"What are you doing, Son-in… Ranma-chan?"</p><p>Ranma-chan looked at the Amazon, but she couldn't speak.  It was like her thoughts were being sucked off in different directions. Some  seemed to speed down her left arm into Ranma, while others were channeled into  Ranko. The questions that always lurked in the back of her mind spilled away  until there were only one or two questions present in her mind. "Who is Ranko?"  she asked under her breath, voicing the first question.</p><p>"I thought we had already established this," Cologne  chided, pointing to the girl on Ranma-chan's right, off-handedly. She frowned  as the girl-boy looked into her eyes and shook her head, dismissing her input.  Cologne narrowed her eyes and studied the flow of chi in this strange circuit.</p><p>Ranma-chan was focusing on the thoughts trying to form in  her mind. She felt strangely empty, yet focused. If her father had ever spared  serious effort on meditation techniques, she would recognize the state she was  in. She might even realize that it was a state her ancestors had identified and  given a name. Shibumi. A quality of being without the angst of becoming. In  that state, frustrated by the distraction of a question she should have known  the answer to, she finally realized there had been an answer there, long before  the question could be asked. Her head turned to stare in Ranko's direction. Her  mouth fell open, as she realized too late what she had done.</p><p>Everyone was looking at her with some concern now.</p><p>Ranma-chan's hand recoiled from Ranko's shoulder. As the  contact broke, a tremendous force threw the girl away from her twin. While  Ryouga rushed over to try and intercept the flying girl, Ranma-chan turned  entirely to Ranma, pressing herself tight against him, her arms going around  him as if he was the only thing that could keep her tied to the Earth. She  deliberately tried to provoke the strange polarity he caused, and it confirmed  her suspicion. In that moment, she allowed herself to be the girl she had  become to protect the boy she had been. A girl who had grown in secret, in  shame and in guilt through the little indulgences sponsored by her relationship  with Nodoka. A girl she had denied. A girl she could never be.</p><p>With shaking limbs, she pried herself away from the  trembling and blushing boy. For a moment, he had felt the ascent of a female persona  in his cursed incarnation. He had also reflected on the awkward and dangerous  intimacies of the previous day, and their painful consequences. Unable to  understand what had overcome Ranma-chan, the only safe course seemed to be  having no reaction at all. He just gaped as she staggered to the side of the  road and collapsed into a heap, tears streaming out between tight eyelids. They  were almost masked by the rain sheeting over her face. Cologne, after a glance  at Ranma, standing stiff with shock and fear, hopped over to Ranma-chan and  stood beside her.</p><p>"What is it child? What have you seen that is so  disturbing?"</p><p>Ranma-chan tried to look at the amazon, but her eyes  could not focus through the tears. Wiping the back of her hand across her lids,  she sucked in a breath, "I'm such an idiot! I didn't even see it!"</p><p>"See what?"</p><p>"I was too stinkin' proud," the girl sobbed on, unable to  explain her revelation. She pulled her legs in—planting the soles of her  feet—spread wide enough for her elbows to rest on her kneecaps, so she could  bury her face in her forearms. "So stuck on all that man-among-men crap, I  never saw it," she muttered to herself cryptically.</p><p>Cologne carefully composed her face and took a deep  breath. "Are you saying what I think you are saying?" she dared to ask.</p><p>Ranma-chan looked up at her and blinked. "Yeah. Sure.  Might as well let you rub it in, now that it's too late," she groused, looking  away. Rubbing the beads of rain and tears from her face, she sighed and decided  to spell it out. "I never wanted to be a girl. I figured, hell, I'm a guy, I  can't be a girl. Copy-kun was right though. When I was a girl, I refused to  admit it. An' I'm not talkin' about the curse. A different body don't make you  a girl. Wearing dresses and eatin' ice cream and getting kissed by a guy don't  make you a girl. It's somethin' inside, somethin' that grows with experience,  and before you know it, you are a girl cuz you <i>understand,</i>" she said  softly.</p><p>Ranko, who had come running back with Ryouga, had caught  most of this speech. She stared down at her twin and gasped, "What the hell are  you sayin'!" She reached down and pulled the other girl up to her feet and  shook her, "You can't tell me I'm a girl! I don't understand anything! I don't  know the first thing about being a girl! You can't go tellin' me what I am!"</p><p>Ranma-chan managed to break the other girl's grip and  staggered back. "You're too scared to see it. I didn't even get it until I  wondered why I…" she stopped and looked away.</p><p>"What! Tell me!" the other girl raged.</p><p>"Why would it bother me to give up being Ranko? I mean,  like it bothers me to give up being Ranma?" Ranma-chan demanded.</p><p>"It's just a stupid name! How the hell should I know!"</p><p>"Because it's not," she retorted. "It's an identity."</p><p>Cologne quirked an eyebrow at this, while the others  rubbed their heads in confusion or fumed in anger. "Perhaps you should explain  that, child."</p><p>Ranma-chan pointed at Ranma, "Ranma is not just a name!  It's my identity. It's who I am as a man!" Her hand came around to point at  Ranko. "Just like Ranko is who I am as a girl. Who I'd be as a woman. If I let  go of both, I am neither!"</p><p>Ranko could not reply. She just gaped in astonishment.</p><p>"When did this happen?" Ranma asked, utterly perplexed.</p><p>Ranma-chan turned back on him and began shouting, "It  happened when Akane asked if I wanted to be her friend! It happened when Mikado  kissed me! It happened when I told Mom I was Akane's cousin, and when Mom told  me I'd make a good wife one day, and when we went shopping for bras! It  happened when I was engaged to Picolet Chardin! It happened a little every day,  no matter how hard I fought it!"</p><p>"Are you saying you want to be a girl?" Ryouga asked in a  small voice.</p><p>She turned on him and took a deep breath. "Oh yeah. It  happened when I was in love with you! Do I want to be a girl? It didn't even  occur to me there was a choice until now! It's not my choice now. It's hers!"  She turned to Ranko. With an effort she calmed herself and approached the other  girl. "And, it is a choice. If you can let go of being Ranma, if you can figure  out what it really means to be Ranko, you can be a girl."</p><p>"Why do you feel you do not have this choice?" Cologne  asked gently.</p><p>Ranma-chan turned to her and shrugged. "I'm not sure I  can explain it. I mean, sure, I suppose I could be Ranko, because that's just a  way of being me. I'd remain centered and maybe I wouldn't just evaporate into  thin air."</p><p>"Is that what you are afraid of? Is that what brought on  this whole scene?" the matriarch asked. There was something in her eyes that  disturbed Ranma-chan. She could not imagine what was on the old woman's mind,  but there seemed no reason to deny it. She nodded. "Interesting. So, you feel  that relinquishing your identity, as a man or as a woman, would leave you  vulnerable to the mirror's curse?"</p><p>"That's about it. Don't ask me to explain it, I just get  this strong feeling that I'd fly apart if I tried to pretend to be someone  else."</p><p>Cologne narrowed her eyes shrewdly. "I see. Then perhaps  it would be best to endure a little confusion about who is who, precisely.  Unless you can think of some other aspect of your identity you might be able to  cling to? Something unique to you?"</p><p>Ranma-chan laughed harshly, "Well, not hard to see what's  unique! I'm half and half. Maybe you should call me Nibunnoichi!"</p><p>"Perhaps if it becomes necessary," the old woman grinned.  "However, we're not getting home any faster standing on the road and quibbling  amongst ourselves. I for one would like to get out of this rain and into  something warm and dry!" she announced, eyeing the perch she had abandoned on  Ryouga's shoulder. She could hardly return to it now without turning him into a  pig. Ranma offered her a perch on his shoulder. Ryouga followed those two as  Ranma set off once more for the train station. Ranko lingered behind, seeing  her twin idling.</p><p>"Are you coming?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma-chan sighed and looked at Ranko. There was  still some irritation on her face. "You did tell me to fight," Ranma-chan  reminded her.</p><p>"I didn't say, 'Have a psychotic episode'!" she retorted.  As the two of them began walking, trailing the others at a distance, Ranko  spoke up again, "So. You gonna explain this girl-identity thing? I mean, what  the hell brought that on?"</p><p>Ranma-chan shrugged. "I guess Copy-kun and Copy-chan were  right. When I was caught between you two, it was sort of like I stepped outside  of myself and finally saw what was always right there." As they walked, she tried  to explain what she had been thinking and feeling, when she paused to think of  some name to go by. As she related the details, she remembered the other  question that had surfaced in the strange calm. She had focused all her  attention on "Who is Ranko?" and ignored the deeper question, "Who am I?"  Frowning in thought, during a lull in the conversation, she pondered that one.  For some reason, her mind flashed to a scene at once familiar and unfamiliar. A  memory of herself at Jusenkyo, surrounded by strangers who bound her and threw  her into one of the springs. The scene repeated a few times and then froze as  her body hung in the air over the water's surface, a man's voice echoing in her  ears. "Goodbye, Fa Shen." Blinking, she focused on the horizon. That scene did  not fit into her life. Perhaps it was a dream? She shrugged. The rain suddenly  picked up again, and she shoved her thoughts aside to grumble about being wet  and cold.</p><p>The edge of the storm  finally slid over Nerima, announcing its presence by tapping insanely against  the windows of Furinkan High School. The sudden explosion of fluid chatter  drowned out the teacher's voice and drew the attention of Akane and Ukyo. They  automatically looked at Ranma's empty desk, and thus in each other's direction.  Meeting each other's eyes, they nodded, sharing the same concern for one  martial artist. It was strange in a way that rain was no longer part of the  background of their lives. Thanks to Ranma, and other cursed individuals, the  rain was just a mask for the strange, silent and capricious silhouette that  moved randomly across the stage turning the lives of the "characters" on end.  Who could witness an instant girl, or cat, or duck, or yeti-riding-bull-carrying-crane-and-eel  appearing in their midst, and not wonder what it would do to their own lives to  have everything familiar about themselves melt away in a handful of water.</p><p>Akane sighed and looked back at her work. She had talked  to Ukyo between classes and at lunch, explaining what they had all learned from  Cologne. The okonomiyaki chef had listened to the news that Genma had proposed  exploiting the mirror's curse to present Copy-kun as Ranma, both to Nodoka, as  her son, and to Akane, as her fiancé. Ukyo was even more startled to hear about  the strange endorsement Genma had made for Ranma to consider being a girl, the  daughter Nodoka had always wanted. "But as Ranma pointed out, Copy-chan makes a  better choice for that, for the same reason Copy-kun makes a better Ranma,"  Akane had confided.</p><p>"Still, I can't believe Ranma's old man would even  suggest that!"</p><p>Akane shrugged. "Genma is capable of suggesting anything,  as long as the outcome is to his benefit. When Ranma took over the engagement  to Picolet, to learn combat dining, the old fool was tempted to let Ranma marry  the creep just so he could stuff his fat face with French cuisine for the rest  of his life!" Akane was still a bit bitter about that. Ranma had come close to  starving to death trying to master the Parlay du Foie Gras, and perhaps even  closer to losing his mind under the added burden of Madame St. Paul's Bridal  Training. Ranma had swallowed every trace of masculine pride and choked down a  lot more femininity than he had intended. "So, yeah, despite all that  man-among-men crap he spouts all the time, Genma has no problems seeing his son  as a daughter!" Akane concluded.</p><p>"Yeah, at least as long as it serves to keep his belly  full, or to keep him from having to slice it open," Ukyo had agreed. "It's too  bad he had to make Ran-chan sign that contract too."</p><p>"That stupid contract is the reason Ranma's being robbed  of his whole life!" Akane growled. Worse, she kept to herself, once the other  boy was Ranma, the fathers would be rushing them to the altar as fast as  possible to fulfill their pact. "If he can't figure out a way to stop the  bleeding, he'll even die."</p><p>"Is there some way to stop them?"</p><p>"I don't know. I mean, technically it is a cure," Akane  sighed.</p><p>"The cure sounds worse than the curse."</p><p>They had gone on talking through lunch, and Akane had  been dwelling off and on over the last thing Ukyo had said on the matter. "I can  hardly imagine Ranma without the curse now. I mean, sure, he'd still have it if  he survives too, and he or Copy-chan would be Ranko, but it would be strange to  see Ranma get wet and not turn into a girl. I've gotten so used to it!"</p><p>The truth was, so had Akane. A struggling weed of romance  had been budding between her and Ranma the boy, but the branch of friendship  between them seemed to thrive best between her and Ranma the girl. Sure, it was  a confusing and infuriating friendship, and it did seem to get in the way of  everything, but it made Ranma unique in her mind. She had no idea what it would  take for Copy-kun to remember being Ranma, or how long. She was not sure how  she would feel about an all male Ranma, especially if he was overshadowed by an  all female, or the original cursed Ranma. Such thoughts often tormented her whenever  Ranma stumbled onto something that might cure him. It was not that she wanted  him to be a girl, or in anyway preferred him as a girl. At least that was what  she desperately hoped. She frowned. Maybe she just believed, deep down, that as  long as Ranma was cursed there was no way the two of them would get married.  Maybe it was just safer that way.</p><p>The moment Copy-kun became Ranma, that cushion would just  disappear. Perhaps that explained why she could not imagine her reaction to  being engaged or married to him. Perhaps she was afraid that, without the  excuse of the curse, she be forced to confront her feelings. Taking a deep  breath, she closed her eyes. Her thoughts were already too personal and honest  for her to deal with. She sighed and muttered under her breath, "It's not like  I have to know right now. Even when he's totally normal, Ranma can hardly  remember last week. What are the odds the other two will remember anything  soon?"</p><p>Thinking of the copies, and deciding she had wasted  enough thought on the boy, she considered the girl. She certainly had one thing  Ranma never had shown. She was quite happy with her femininity, and not afraid  to show it. Of course, she showed it with the same arrogant ego-centricity  Ranma invested in his manhood. It was kind of funny that Ranma had more poise  as a woman than Copy-chan, but at least it was not just an act with the  duplicate. If the girl could just get a clue, she might make a good friend,  Akane thought. As she was, she was almost as lost as poor Ryouga. Akane  chuckled under her breath. Maybe that was why Copy-chan kept running into Ranma's  rival.</p><p>Akane looked out the window, watching the water stream  across the glass. The image of the two of them kissing in the park came back to  her. Akane had retreated as quickly as she could, but she had not missed the  fact that Ryouga had responded as passionately before she had interrupted.  Akane had been discreet about the incident with the koi rod and Ranma, and she  had tried her best not to hold it against him. The poor boy was so lost and  lonely, and so incredibly shy, how could he be blamed for his unwanted  attraction to Ranma's girl half. After all, her fiancé had used it to mess with  Ryouga too many times to count. It was kind of tragic that Copy-chan had  appeared to confuse his relationship with Akari. At the same time, Ryouga  seemed to have some reservations about the pig-loving girl. Akane had not been  blind to Ryouga's contempt for her pet P-chan. To her knowledge, Ryouga had always  gone out of his way to avoid her pet pig, and absolutely hated it when Ranma  teased him by calling him by her pet's name. Akane had pointedly ignored Ranma  constantly implying that Ryouga and P-chan were connected. Just because she  knew about Jusenkyo curses did not mean she could be conned into thinking  everyone she met turned into something else. She felt that the comments were  just Ranma's way of getting back at Ryouga for laughing at his curse. She had  not realized how much Ryouga hated pigs until she saw his reaction to Akari's  love of pigs.</p><p>It had reminded Akane of her own feelings about boys. She  had no idea what Ryouga's problem with pigs was, but Ranma provoked his rival  over it the same way he provoked her by always calling her a tom-boy. It seemed  strange that Ranma had actually encouraged Ryouga's relationship with Akari. At  least until it became clear how much it irritated Ryouga. Now that she thought  about it, it had to irk the lost boy to have a girl throw herself at him simply  for defeating her sumo-pig. It reminded Akane of Shampoo and her kiss of  marriage. She wondered why people came up with such stupid rules for forming  relationships. Maybe, just maybe, it would be best to encourage two people who  seemed to want to be together? Considering what Copy-chan faced to become  Ranko, it would be best for her to have someone who appreciated her for the  girl she was, and did not hold her male origins against her. Maybe, if she and  Ryouga were truly in love, she would not be destroyed by Ranma's memories.  Akane could remember the depression that had threatened Ranma when his curse  was locked. She also remembered how the curse had not mattered a bit when he  was in love, under the influence of the koi rod.</p><p>Akane contemplated this for a while, a plan beginning to  form in her head.</p><p>AN: This chapter took a lot  longer than intended. As stated in the beginning, this story establishes  several things meant to be explored in a sequel to Ranma Nibunnoichi while  remaining inside the scope of the original series. As tends to happen, the  fleshed out form of a story can be incredibly different from the original  outline. I've noted the suggestion to treat this as an AU, but since this is  fanfic I don't feel it is necessary to assert that. It's a safe assumption that  Rumiko Takahashi did not dream of this story! So, my objective is a little  complicated by how the story in progress is interpreted by the reader. Has too  much happened for Ranma to continue through the conclusion of the original  series? If it can be said without offending Ms. Takahashi, I submit that many  of the experiences Ranma has had, in canon, would beg the same question if the  original work had been in a novel format. The series skimmed over the surface  of a very deep topic, and it is that topic I meant to explore as I wrote. I  read a little more into the events forming the foundation of this story, and I  hope it is evident that the changes you witness here are rooted in the series.  Under the unique circumstances of this story, Ranma confronts the consequences  of things he can no longer ignore. It's a learning process, and I make no guarantees  that he will embrace any or all of it. So, if you are seriously wondering how  things could possible go back to "normal" after all of this, well… keep  watching. I might just pull it off!</p><p>So, here we are at chapter 15! It is two full days since  the male copy emerged, and he has awakened as the new and improved, uncursed  Ranma. This can't possibly be a good thing! Worse, Akane is plotting something  to encourage romance between Ryouga and Ranko. Dare we imagine? And what about  Cologne's secret plot? What will she do if she proves that Ranma was Fa Shen in  a previous life? And another thing, are the new Ranma and Ranko afflicted with  any residue of being Copy-kun and Copy-chan? Have we really seen the last of  the amorous duo? What could possibly happen in the next five days? With this  crowd? Are you kidding! See you next time on, Ranma Nibunnoichi: Reflections!</p><p>Ja ne!</p>
