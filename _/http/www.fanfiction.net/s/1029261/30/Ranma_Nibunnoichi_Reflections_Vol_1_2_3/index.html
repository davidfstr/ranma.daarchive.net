</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Thirty: Manly Obligations</p><p>In spite of the fact that it  was almost midnight, no one in the Tendo Dojo appeared to be inclined towards bed.  Ranma spotted Soun and Genma, in panda form, scowling over a game of shogi that  had not even been started yet. Nabiki had the table covered in travel brochures  and what appeared to be detailed files on the Kunos and their family assets,  scribbling madly through calculations and muttering about the relative cost of  commercial travel and bribes sufficient to allow a privately owned jet passage  through China. Oddly, Cologne was at her elbow pointing out the location of air  strips in Qinghai Province. The pair of them looked up as Nodoka and Ryouga  followed Ranma into the room, led by Kasumi. Without a word, they cleared the  table and excused themselves. Ranma shrugged and followed the two upstairs, in  search of "Ranko". Through the open door of the guest room, she spotted her  sitting in Akane's arms, who served as a back rest holding Ranko up right. In  front of them, Shampoo was supporting a book in her lap and flipping the pages  while Ranko read the text. Ukyo was off to the right, holding a drink with a straw,  offering it occasionally for Ranko to drink.</p><p>"Enjoying all the attention, 'Ranko'?" Ranma teased,  entering the room.</p><p>"Ranma. Close the door," Ranko snapped her head up and  ordered.</p><p>Frowning, Ranma did so. "I thought I was supposed to be  Ranko," she challenged, looking for an explanation. She came forward and knelt  across from Ukyo. Peering at the book in Shampoo's lap, she frowned. It was  written in Chinese. Most of the symbols could be related to Kanji, but the  result made little to no sense. Looking up at her twin, she frowned  suspiciously, "Don't tell me you're Fa Shen."</p><p>"No. But more of her memories are coming to me," she  sighed, leaving the confusion that was causing her unmentioned. "The reason I  am Ranko is because you are Ranma," she addressed the first question. "I've  given up everything that was not mine, so you should be happy to have that back  all to yourself."</p><p>Ranma paused. "Do you wanna explain that?"</p><p>"You mean you don't remember waking up?"</p><p>Ranma paled. That question stabbed through the wall of a  psychic hurricane deep into the eye of calm preserving Ranma's sanity. Her  instincts still insisted that she had arrived in Jusenkyo a few hours ago, got  knocked into a spring and woke up to evening in the heart of Tokyo. Her first  experience in her cursed form, making love with Ryouga. At the same time, her  head was full of memories detailing almost a year building up to that moment.  She clung to those memories desperately, needed them to preserve her sanity. It  was so much easier to accept that actually going through with it, actually  having sex, had triggered some kind of regression to the event that made it  possible. An indication that she could not abandon her manhood. So, she had  fought the strange dysphoria, denied her instincts. Ranko's question cut right  through all of that. Ranma remembered waking up, helpless, with a boy she could  barely remember fucking her. Somehow, Ranko knew about that?</p><p>"What would you know about that!" Ranma demanded as a  deep, burning flush darkened her face. The surprise on everyone's faces warned  her too late that, whatever Ranko had meant, it had not been precisely what she  feared. Her obvious embarrassment roused immediate suspicion.</p><p>"There something you wanna let us in on, Ran-chan?" Ukyo  grinned.</p><p>"You do remember us pulling you out of that spring,  right?"</p><p>Ranma glared at Ukyo and turned to Ranko, nodding  hesitantly. Ranko knew about the dream. Not what happened AFTER she awoke.  Maybe Ranma was right still. Maybe she had blacked out and somehow fell into  synch with the entranced Ranma-chan. Maybe that was what triggered her  regression. Clinging to that hope, Ranma addressed the question. "I had this  strange dream. Ryouga and I were… uh… well, you know how we, uh… get into  fights. Um. I, ah… musta gotten knocked out or somethin' and that's when I had  the dream. I still don't know how you can know about that…"</p><p>"Is good you not amazon womans! You let get knocked out  by Lost Boy, he be you Airen now!" Shampoo laughed. When Ranma proceeded to  blush even darker, with a surprised look on his face, the others joined in and  laughed until they could not breathe. Just as Shampoo recovered, she added,  "You no be careful, next thing know, you get knocked UP by Lost Boy! Then in  really big mess!" Shampoo fell over laughing.</p><p>Akane fought for sanity and snapped, "Geez, Shampoo! Go  easy on the guy! It's bad enough he's stuck as a girl at the moment, there's no  need to terrify him!" She turned a reassuring look on Ranma, and was startled  by how spooked she looked. "Are you alright, Ranma?"</p><p>"I want to know what the hell is going on!"</p><p>"Ranma," Ranko interrupted, wiping her eyes dry. She had  laughed so hard she started crying. Shaking her head, she returned to the  point, "What I was going to say was, it wasn't a dream. Your mind has been  submerged since you fell in the spring before last summer. I guess it's harder  for you to tell your memories of the past year are mine than it was for Fa  Shen. I know what you 'dreamed' 'cuz I was there too." She proceeded to explain  what had happened to Fa Shen and herself, and what she presumed happened to  Ranma. Ranma noted instantly that this shattered the plan she had been told  over the phone. She could not join with Ranko; she would not regain the ability  to become a man. She was locked in stunned silence as Ranko explained the  theory of who she was and where she had come from. "I had no idea that waking  both of you up could have killed me, I just didn't want to leave you buried  there."</p><p>Ranma had gone very pale. Her instincts were screaming in  agreement with Ranko and Fa Shen's logic. Her denial crumbled. Once again, her  mind tried to shut down, as it had when she was cleaning up after… The trauma  was beyond her grasp. The pleasure, greater than anything the boy had ever  known. With a heroic effort, she struggled to remain coherent and try to  understand what was going on. After a long silence, she spoke. "So, what you  are saying is, everything I remember from the past year came from you. I got  them from a 'projection' of you, so all her thoughts and feelings… they belong  to you, not me?" she demanded in a strained voice.</p><p>Ranko nodded. "Yes. Just like everything I can remember  before drowning or falling in the spring belong to Fa Shen and you." She was  going to say something more, but Ranma seized up. She tightened and shook  violently for several moments as she fought for control of her mind. Then, she  simply sagged and keeled over backwards to stare at the ceiling. "Are you  okay?"</p><p>"Up until this week, you believed you were me," Ranma had  found a way to cope, searching through inherited memories and finding the  overwhelming majority to be compatible with her self image. "You had no clue  you could be anyone else. Except for some trouble rememberin' things I would  have remembered quicker, you thought and did and said everything exactly like I  would." They were statements of observation, but it sounded like she wanted  someone to agree with her.</p><p>"I have to assume that. I had to have your identity  stripped away from me to even begin to be any different," Ranko put carefully.  Ranma crossed her arms and stared up for a little longer, before sitting  upright.</p><p>"I guess I can live with it." Ranma sighed, looking years  older suddenly. The shock was terrible. Numbing. Ranma had lost her manhood and  almost a year of her life. The memories of a person who had thought and acted  just like she would have, were a pale substitute. Even if they gave her the  benefit of that year, and provided a way to deal with her present form. She had  to accept them, of course. She needed them. The condition and circumstances she  had inherited her body in could not be altered. It was conceivable, given the  same circumstances, she would have made the same "sacrifice" as the "projected"  Ranko. Unable to deny she had enjoyed her ruin, she would just have to learn to  deal with it.</p><p>Pushing all of that aside, she returned to Ranko's  problem. It was a nice distraction from her own problems. She took a moment to  sort things out. "So, your curse is locked, and you're hovering on the brink of  death. I suppose everyone else knows I'm the real Ranma, so Pops probably has  some scheme cooked up to restore my manhood and push ahead with marrying me and  Akane?" she quickly postulated, giving Akane a cautious, curious look. There  was a round of nods. Ranma sighed. "What's it gonna take to fix you, Ranko?"</p><p>"I'm looking for ways to regenerate ki. I need to be back  to full strength to close myself off from the mirror. I can't unlock my curse until  then or the next change could erase me," she shuddered. She pointed at the  books, "I'm looking at the bit about the Chaunshontsuniichan right now. Somehow  that curse creates two bodies, each with as much ki as the original. Obviously,  there's a way to draw ki directly from the soul, so I am trying to figure out  how and charge myself back up."</p><p>"That actually makes sense," Ranma tilted her head in  thought. Going over what she knew of ki, she quickly became distracted. She  could feel how she was forced to access her new memories, just to participate  in this conversation, and how each time she did she strengthened her connection  to them. The boy she had been a year ago had already been irreversibly changed.  Unable to avoid that, she tried not to fight it. At least she had only a year  of such memories to cope with. Ranko apparently had two lifetimes, short as  they were. Rather than bring that up, she picked up a question that had been on  her mind coming upstairs. "What's up with Nabiki and the old mummy?"</p><p>"Emergency expedition to Jusenkyo, get boy and girl curse  for Ranma and Fa Shen," Shampoo informed soberly.</p><p>Ranma felt a sudden wash of relief. If such a plan did  not go completely awry, there was hope of being a man again. She could climb  out of the pit she had landed in, eradicate the weakness that undermined her  manhood. She hoped being male offered something to counter the irresistible  temptation of intercourse as a girl. She could not conceal her eagerness as she  challenged, "Seriously!"</p><p>"Our father's insisted on taking care of the two of you  immediately," Akane nodded. "Nabiki thinks she can con Kuno into letting us use  his family's private jet, and Cologne knows who to contact for permits to fly  directly to her home province. All three of you are going, but… Ranko can't  come back until she has recovered enough to have her curse unlocked, and she  has to visit the Musk for that." Akane sighed, "Unfortunately, none of the rest  of us can go with you."</p><p>"Why not?" Ranma frowned.</p><p>"The jet can only carry so many people, Ranchan!"</p><p>"Who needs a jet?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Why can't we shove everyone into the compact mirror and  have Mousse fly us all there? Doesn't he sometimes carry messages that way for  Cologne?"</p><p>Shampoo smacked her fist into her palm, "Is true! Mousse  do all time!"</p><p>"Sometimes you frighten me," Akane gaped, staring at  Ranma.</p><p>"Feelin's mutual," Ranma smirked. They knew each other  that well, but technically they had just met. Ranma had to laugh. It was better  than screaming. Akane stared at her in confused annoyance, eyes narrowed, as  she roared hysterically. When she calmed down, she felt a lot better, but  decided not to explain what had struck her as so funny. Instead, she turned to  the person who made the "joke" possible. She leaned forward and put her hand on  top of Ranko's as she said, "Don't worry, Ranko. We'll get you fixed up!" At  the same time Ranko stiffened in surprise. "What is it?"</p><p>Ranko took her hand back and began to move her arms,  slowly and steadily through part of a kata. "Wow. What did you do, Ranma?"</p><p>"I didn't do nothin'! I swear!" she waved her hands in  instant denial.</p><p>"What is it Ranko?" Akane shook the smaller girl.</p><p>"When she touched me, I got a sudden rush of energy!" she  stared at Ranma, and touched her again. "Huh. Nothing this time… It was sorta  like you had a charge of energy built up around you, or inside of you and…" She  shifted her attention inwards. She nodded gently, "Somehow you had some excess  ki around you and it flowed into me when you touched me! Whatever it was,  raised my ki level a bit, enough to get rid of the shakes. Ranma, can you think  of anything you've done that would let you build up a charge like that!"</p><p>Ranma blinked slowly. "Maybe our ki is close enough that  you could siphon some of it off?" she suggested. Her mind was trying to do that  odd shutting itself down thing again.</p><p>Ranko shook her head, "No, if that was the case, I'd have  felt that earlier when Fa Shen touched me." Ranko thought back. She had been  pretty numb at first, and had not noticed it at the time, but Fa Shen had  casually touched her several times for comfort, support and curiosity. If there  had been any ki transfer she would certainly have noticed it! "It has to be  something you've done recently, since you woke up."</p><p>Ranma swallowed, in sudden panic. In search of anything  "unusual" she had done, there was one overwhelmingly large suspect that  immediately reared forth. Her skin chilled and prickled as she thought of it.  At the same time she was shaking her head in denial.</p><p>"Damn!" Ranko looked down.</p><p>"Ranma?" Akane studied her worriedly. "Are you okay? You  look like you've seen a ghost."</p><p>"Wha-what? I mean… No. I need to- I have to talk to  Ryouga… and-  and my Mom."</p><p>"That was odd," Ukyo muttered as Ranma ran out of the  room.</p><p>"Well, maybe we should tell Nabiki and Cologne about  Ranma's idea?" Akane proposed, trying to keep her growing concern out of her voice.  Ukyo shrugged and got up. She skipped out the door and down the hall to  Nabiki's room and returned a moment later with the middle Tendo daughter and  the amazon matriarch. Akane quickly repeated Ranma's idea to them. After they  recovered from the surprise and embarrassment of overlooking that option, they  huddled around Ranko and quickly considered the plan.</p><p>Ranma rushed downstairs and  into the Tea Room, her mind awhirl. The instant she heard about the planned  trip to Jusenkyo, she had silently resolved to avoid any and all temptations to  be a girl. Unlike Ranma-chan, she had no rival in their trio for the identity  of Ranma. She could understand the other girl's reasons for claiming the  identity of Ranko. It was perfect for someone who was a fusion of Ranma and Fa  Shen. In an odd way, Ranma could almost think of Ranko as their daughter. That  feeling had inspired her promise to help fix the girl. If what she suspected  was true, the only way she would be able to keep that promise was to give in to  her greatest female temptation. She burst into the room and stared at Ryouga.  Nodoka looked up at her, over the brim of her tea cup. Before the woman could  swallow and speak, Ranma stormed over to Ryouga and hauled him to his feet. "I  need to speak with you about something. Now."</p><p>"Huh?" Ryouga caught his balance.</p><p>"Ranneko," Nodoka cleared her throat and set down her  cup. "I am still waiting to discuss some things with you."</p><p>Ranma glanced at her. "This will just take a moment. Can  you please wait a little longer? This is important," she declared in her most  serious voice. Nodoka studied her a moment then nodded. Ranma headed out to the  dojo, "Come on, Ryouga."</p><p>Ryouga shrugged and allowed himself to be dragged out of  the house, down the covered walkway and into the training hall. Once they were  inside, alone, and the doors secured, he asked, "Do you want to tell me what's  going on?"</p><p>"In a second," she brushed him off and composed her mind.  She could not bring herself to talk about what they had done that night. It  would be simpler to look for evidence linking their activity to the generation  or separation of extra ki. She nodded and turned to study the boy across from  her. "Are you familiar with your normal ki levels? Can you sense your own ki?"  Ryouga nodded. "Okay, take a look now and tell me what you see."</p><p>Ryouga focused his attention inward, asking, "You want to  tell me what I am looking for? I don't sense any drain, but then again I have  not been fighting recently. I don't know if I could power a shishihokodan right  now. My ki is the strongest I've ever felt it, but I'm just not generating any  heavy chi. I guess you cured me of my depression," the boy grinned. For a  moment, she looked relieved, then she frowned in thought. "Is that what you  wanted to know?"</p><p>"Is there any residue or charge built up?"</p><p>Ryouga concentrated harder, then nodded. "That's odd. I  almost didn't notice it because it's kind of detached. It's my ki, but it's  sort of been shed or split off from the rest. What does that mean?" He opened  his eyes and jerked. Ranma looked like someone had killed her puppy and offered  her a kitten instead. "Ranma?"</p><p>"What do I do?" she breathed in sudden desperation. More  to herself than Ryouga, she babbled, "I- I- I have to tell… but then they'll  know… I… Ryouga!" Ranma looked up at him, and at the sight of his concern  suddenly wanted to run into his arms, be held, protected. Horrified by her  emotional response, she literally jumped away from the boy to stop herself from  obeying it. She wanted to scream. It was easy to integrate the memories she had  gained, but along with the information came patterns of thought and action  ultimately evolved from those experiences. She could not reject them, but she  did not want to be controlled by them. Only the most recent developments truly  scared the boy in her. Trembling, she fought the emotions they unlocked.</p><p>"What's going on?" Ryouga was hurt and concerned by her  reactions.</p><p>"I don't even know where to start, man."</p><p>"Well, for one thing, what's wrong with you?'</p><p>"You don't want to know," Ranma declared, turning and  walking out of the dojo. It was impossible to tell Ryouga what she had learned  about herself from Ranko, how it changed everything between them beyond hope.  If she could not tell him she was Ranma, she could not tell him why she was  afraid to reveal the solution to Ranko's problem. If she revealed that she had  sex with Ryouga, and that ever got back to her mother, Ranma was dead. She  collapsed on the walk on her way back inside. "Too many secrets," she sobbed,  fighting against tears that came so easily in this form.</p><p>Ryouga, having followed her, heard and saw this and felt  a sharp, cold shock run up his spine. He moved to her side and picked her up,  "What secrets, Ranma? What don't I want to know?"</p><p>Ranma sighed. "Hell, you'll find out anyway. I… am  Ranma."</p><p>Ryouga frowned, "You've been telling me that since…"</p><p>Ranma began to shake harder. "Now I know why!" she  interrupted. "I am Ranma, the real Ranma, the only Ranma there is. The girl you  loved died in your arms tonight. Part of her anyway. The rest of her is  upstairs," Ranma bit off as clearly as she could manage. When Ryouga stiffened  in shock, Ranma broke out of his grip and ran inside. In her thoughtless  desperation to get her point through his thick skull, she had said the worst  possible thing. A strangled cry of rage and grief came from the boy she had  just abandoned. Ranma grit her teeth and forced herself to keep walking, hating  herself more with every step. Nodoka met her in the hall, took one look at her  lost and self-loathing expression and dragged her into the furo. Ranma did not  resist, until the woman began to undress her. "What are you doing?"</p><p>"We're taking a bath. It will give us the privacy to  talk," she pulled the girl's dress up over her head and set it aside. Then she  noticed the girl was only wearing a bra and stockings under it. In a voice of  parental alarm, Nodoka gasped, "What happened to your panties, Ranneko?"</p><p>Kasumi had an unpleasant  premonition when Ranma came downstairs and dragged Ryouga outside to talk. She  knew the girl would be informed of what had happened as soon as she spoke with  Ranko, in the process learning that all the obligations and privileges of being  Ranma would be returned to her, along with her proper gender, in the near  future. It had not taken much to guess how the revelation would impact the  nascent relationship between her and Ryouga. Fa Shen had claimed to remember  things from the Ranma he replaced, so Ranma probably remembered things from the  Ranko she replaced, but would not want to be Ranko anymore than Fa Shen wanted  to be Ranma. Kasumi put a hand to her head, staving off a headache. All  confusion aside, her fear had been confirmed by the scene she just witnessed,  as Ranma destroyed Ryouga with the bad news. As the girl fled, Kasumi slipped  out of the shadows and knelt beside the devastated boy and gently hugged him.</p><p>As he felt the support of the eldest Tendo daughter,  Ryouga articulated his suffering in a choked, soul wrenching cry. A moment  later the sound of the door closing behind Ranma was heard, and Kasumi bent her  head to Ryouga's ear and she murmured, "Ryouga. Ranko mentioned that this might  happen because of Ranma's awakening. She asked me to bring you to her if it  did, so she could explain what is really going on. Can you… keep it together  long enough to hear her out?"</p><p>"Ranko?" the boy asked, grasping for a ray of hope.</p><p>"Yes. Part of what Ranma said was true. Ranma is not the  girl you fell in love with. The Ranko you dated tonight was a… a projection,  they said… of the Ranko upstairs. I'm still having a hard time understanding  it. I think she can explain it better. Would you like me to take you up to  her?" Kasumi offered.</p><p>Ryouga nodded, fighting to hold the shards of his heart  together. Kasumi offered a reassuring, motherly smile, and helped the boy to  his feet, then let him into the house. There was no sign of Ranma or Nodoka as  they made their way to the Tea Room. Genma was waving signs madly, keeping up  his side of an argument with Soun, who was straining to keep the panda from  rushing out of the room.</p><p>"Father? What is going on?"</p><p>[Nodoka has Ranma!] was written on a sign Genma pulled  out of the stack at his feet. He kicked over another. [She took him into the  bath!] A couple more signs followed, [He doesn't understand the danger!], [I  have to separate them! Rescue my son!]</p><p>At the same time, Soun was retorting. "Saotome-kun!  Please be reasonable! I am sure Ranm- Ranko explained everything! Nodoka  suspects nothing! You mustn't go in there! Ranma is safe from hot water, but  you are not!"</p><p>[That's not the point! They're BATHING together!] the  panda moaned.</p><p>"They're in the BATH! What else would the be doing  together!" Soun shook the panda roughly. "Get a hold of yourself, Saotome-kun!"</p><p>[But, he's never been with a naked woman before!] The  sign flipped. [It's also his first time AS a naked woman!] A new sign. [He'll  flip out! He'll expose his true identity!]</p><p>"Fa Shen said he should remember everything," Soun  protested.</p><p>Kasumi cleared her throat. "Ranma has already talked to  Ranko. Maybe you should come upstairs and she can tell you how Ranma is dealing  with all of this?" she suggested. "Maybe Nabiki has worked out the details for  that trip to China. You could also talk to her," Kasumi added. If nothing else,  the fathers needed to concentrate on doing something productive. Both of them  had been unhinged by the night's events. After demanding the families mount an  immediate excursion to restore Ranma's manhood, and setting the plans in  motion, they had done nothing besides brood. They had argued about what sort of  state Ranma would be in when he arrived, concerned that he might reveal himself  to his mother upon awakening before anyone could explain to him what had  happened. Genma remembered the reaction Ranma—the person everyone had assumed  was Ranma—had to being cursed. From the way Fa Shen had reacted, the two men  were convinced Ranma would rouse Nodoka's suspicions. Retreating into panda  form had only made Genma worse, since he could not articulate his fears, or  confront the "boy" when she came home.</p><p>"Why, Kasumi! That is an excellent idea!" Soun locked his  arm around the foreleg of Genma-panda and began dragging him toward the stairs.  "Come on, Saotome-kun. Let's go see what Nabiki and the old woman have figured  out!" With a last look in the direction of the wash room, Genma relented and  allowed himself to be dragged upstairs. Kasumi and a shell-shocked Ryouga  followed them. A moment later, everyone but Nodoka and Ranma was crammed into  the guest room. This included Mousse who climbed in through the window as  Kasumi led Ryouga over to Ranko's side.</p><p>"Why you come back here, Mousse?" Shampoo fumed.</p><p>"Now, now, Great-Granddaughter," Cologne soothed, perching  on her staff and studying the boy carefully. "It's actually good that he is  here, as we will need his help to restore Ranma and Fa Shen to semi-normal. Do  come in, boy."</p><p>"What can he do to help my son?" Genma demanded, setting  down the kettle Kasumi had left on a hot plate in the guest room after it's  contents restored his human form. Considering the role the male amazon had  played in provoking the current fiasco, Genma was far from willing to trust  Mousse in anything.</p><p>"Actually, it was Ranma's idea," Cologne stated. She  repeated Ranma's plan, with help from the girls who had first heard it, and  with logistical details worked out by herself and Nabiki. "We will need most of  tomorrow to prepare, since we will have to provide food, water and supplies for  two to three days for each person who rides in the compact. There are some  favorable routes, and good winds, but crossing the Sea of Japan and most of  China is quite a bit for a duck. Wouldn't you agree, Mousse?"</p><p>"The flight is never without it's hazards, Elder, but  with the right preparation, I am certain I could reach Jusenkyo in forty-eight  hours or less," the boy nodded. "However, I must first take care of the  business that brings me here again tonight," he raised a stalling hand and  turned to approach Ranko and knelt before her, "I challenge you, Ranko, for the  right to your hand in marriage."</p><p>There was an immediate uproar. Everyone spoke at once in  disbelief or anger, drowning each other out. Cologne finally shouted for  silence and pointed to Mousse, "Explain yourself, Mousse!"</p><p>"I should think that was self explanatory, Elder. Ranko  is a fine woman, and a warrior without equal under normal circumstances. Also,  as I have made my intentions known, and will wait until such time as she is  able to meet me in honorable combat, you now have reason to trust that no harm  will befall those who travel with her in my care," Mousse declared. Then he  smiled, "I will be happy to deliver her, and all who wish to accompany her, to  our home in China as soon as this challenge is met."</p><p>"You won't help us get to China until I fight you!"  Ranko gasped.</p><p>"That is correct. I do not want the council to rule on  your status until I have had a chance to establish my claim," Mousse nodded.</p><p>"Why are you doing this Mousse!" Ranko pleaded. "How can  you do this to Ranma and Fa Shen!"</p><p>"As soon as Elder Cologne recognized you as an amazon, I  knew I had no choice. Because of you, regardless of who you thought you were, I  have lost every chance I had to marry Shampoo. Since I cannot settle for less,  my only hope is to try for more. That means, I must defeat and marry you."</p><p>"What makes you think I will let you!"</p><p>"It doesn't matter. All that matters is that you have to  let me try."</p><p>Ranko stiffened and stared at Cologne. "Is this true?"</p><p>Cologne nodded sadly, "I am afraid so, child. You don't  have to fight him in your present condition, but, you cannot refuse the  challenge without dire consequences. If you refuse, you lose the protection of  your amazon 'heritage' and Shampoo would have to fulfill the Kiss of Death. If  she refuses to do so, Mousse is free to proceed with his original plan to  enslave Shampoo. Because I cannot allow that, the three of you would die for  nothing." Cologne spat and glared at Mousse. Because all of his plotting was  rooted in amazon law, she did not have the right to punish him for his  impudence. "You will find no allies among her 'siblings' by denying them  passage to Jusenkyo, Mousse. A very foolish move," she declared with scorn.</p><p>Mousse shrugged, "I do not agree. This will encourage  them to help her recover as quickly as possible. It will guarantee that she is  fit to return to China, and able to concentrate on dealing with the Musk to  unlock her curse."</p><p>Ryouga, who had listened to all of this, stepped forward  and clamped a fist of stone around Mousse's neck. "One of the last things Ranko  told me, before Ranma woke up and destroyed her, was that it was you who caused  Ranma-chan's collapse. You are responsible for the 'awakenings' that destroyed  the woman I love. The woman who finally admitted that she loved me. The only  thing keeping me sane right now is the thought that my Ranko was just a  projection of this Ranko," he pointed at the red-head for emphasis. A bruised  and sickly aura of green, purple and black was emanating around him, darkening  as he spoke. "I don't know why she's suddenly subject to your amazon laws, but  I can tell you this. If you force her into a loveless marriage you will not  live long enough to take advantage of it," he pulled the near-sighted master of  hidden weapons close, so they were staring into each other's eyes. Mousse's  face was darkening in pace with Ryouga's aura. "Do I make myself clear?"</p><p>Mousse, who had not bothered to struggle, holding onto  Ryouga's arm solely to ease the stress on his neck, tried to nod. Ryouga  snarled and threw him to the ground, away from Ranko. While Mousse pulled  himself together, gasping, Ryouga knelt before Ranko. "Kasumi said you could  explain it to me. There's only one thing I need to know. Is there any hope…?"  he looked up into Ranko's eyes, letting his feelings show plainly on his face.</p><p>Ranko, startled by the threat Ryouga had just delivered  to Mousse, stared back at him. She had no idea what had happened on Ryouga's  date, but, obviously the feelings the boy initially possessed for Copy-chan had  matured toward and been returned by her projection. She wanted to ask what had  happened, but could not bring herself to speak. Instead she just nodded, once,  timidly. She remembered her reaction to Ryouga asking her double on a date. She  did have feelings for him, and no longer any reason to doubt them. It would not  be hard to follow in her projection's footsteps.</p><p>Ryouga let out a breath he had been holding and offered a  weak smirk. In a small voice, he asked, "Do I have to get in line to defeat  you, so I may date with you?"</p><p>Ranko chuckled.</p><p>Cologne sighed and shook her head. "Well, it seems you  have all of Ranma's luck when it comes to romance, child. You've been Ranko  only a few hours now, and already you have two men chasing after you. Not to  mention Shampoo. At least you do not need to worry about Akane and Ukyo, since  their claims are assigned to Ranma," she chuckled. Out of the corner of her  eye, however, she saw the two girls she mentioned stiffen and blush. Akane went  so far as to slip an arm under Ranko's chin in a hesitant, but possessive  embrace. Cologne's eyes narrowed. Perhaps she had spoken too hastily.</p><p>"If Ranko chooses to remain a girl," Genma interrupted, "will  Shampoo continue to pursue Ranma?"</p><p>Shampoo, who was glaring at Akane and Ukyo, turned to  answer, cutting her great-grandmother off. "No. Even if Ranma become boy type  again, no can claim Kiss of Marriage. Ranma must defeat Shampoo his self if  want Shampoo be Ranma Airen. Is same as if amazon womans defeated by mans  possessed by demon or spirit."</p><p>"That is more or less correct, Shampoo," Cologne  admitted. "What the council needs to determine is if Ranko is enough of a man  to fulfill the Kiss of Marriage, or if she was simply pretending to be a man,  in ignorance of her true gender. It's enough of an uncertainty that Mousse is  free to challenge her in spite of Shampoo's claim." Cologne considered that  more carefully, and noticed the position Mousse would be in if he succeeded in  defeating Ranko. Like Shampoo, he would have to await the council's ruling to  validate a marriage to Ranko, but in the interim he could challenge Shampoo  directly over her claim. Shampoo could either forfeit her claim, or fight  Mousse. If Mousse won, he had the option of claiming Shampoo, since Ranko's  status was in doubt. She stared at him, and from the way he was looking at her,  he had been waiting for her to figure it out. Once again, she had  underestimated him.</p><p>"Well, if Ranma can figure out how she was able to charge  Ranko's ki, Ranko might be back to full strength by the time we're packed for  the trip," Akane noted, optimistically. Everyone, except for Shampoo and Ukyo,  stared at her in shock.</p><p>"What are you talking about, Akane?" Nabiki frowned.</p><p>"I'm not sure I understand. Ranko?" Akane passed the  buck.</p><p>"I don't know where it came from, or anything, but when  Ranma touched me, she had a bunch of loose ki inside her or something, and it  flowed into me," Ranko explained. "She doesn't seem to remember doing anything  unusual, but if she can remember how she did it, and if she can do it without  hurting herself, she might be able to charge me back up. If she can teach Fa  Shen, the two of them together could do it twice as fast, since I'm used to  having both their ki."</p><p>"What?" Ryouga asked suspiciously.</p><p>"Do you want it in Chinese?" Ranko smirked. "Since you  were with Ranma, maybe you know how she did it. Can you think of anything  unusual she might have done that would build up extra ki?"</p><p>Ryouga felt his system try to pale and blush at the same  time. It was the only reason his color remained normal. He blinked, and cocked  his jaw several times wordlessly, before noticing all the attention on him. He  looked around the room, taking in the expectant looks on their faces.  Swallowing hard, and frowning in thought, he realized two things. He suddenly  knew why Ranma had freaked out in the dojo, and he did not dare mention the  reason to anyone. With a heavy sigh, he shook his head. "No. But I'll talk to  her about it."</p><p>There was a general silence, until Genma spoke up again. "Ranko?  Ryouga? Can you tell me… How is my son dealing with… with everything?"</p><p>Ryouga scowled.</p><p>Ranko gave Ryouga a concerned look. "He was pretty upset  about things. I think he absorbed my memories of the past year more than Fa  Shen. Most of the time I thought I was him, so they're probably a lot easier to  fit into his personality. He seemed to understand everything that is going on  up to now, and he sounded happy about the trip to Jusenkyo."</p><p>"Can't wait to be a guy again," Ryouga muttered angrily.  He forced himself to shake it off and looked at Ranko. "What about you? Do you  want to be a guy again too?"</p><p>Ranko looked down at her hands. "Not permanently. I'd  like to be able to though. I guess the curse is normal for me. I'd feel pretty  weird about never being a guy again. I suppose if I had to be one or the other,  I'd want to be able to make that choice on my own, and not be forced to live  with which ever one I was stuck with because of something else."</p><p>Ryouga nodded. Closing his eyes thoughtfully, he took a  deep breath. He had one last chance. He considered the mystery that was the  woman he loved, the two losses he had already suffered trying to hold onto just  a piece of her. If his only hope of being the man for her was to also be the  woman for her, as he had suggested to Ranma, he was willing to make that  sacrifice. He vowed silently that he would be part of the expedition to  Jusenkyo.</p><p>There had been too many  shocks and revelations in one night. For all the memories she had suddenly  crammed into her head, her mind was not used to the situations she was in. She  had tried to note and keep aware of such things as the need to keep Nodoka from  discovering that she was Ranma, but there was a limit to the number of things  she could keep in mind at one time. The most recent shock absorbed so much of  her attention she had been too distracted to keep up with her mother's actions.  It had not even occurred to her that there was one piece of evidence remaining  from her de-flowing, more telling by its absence, until her mother confronted  her about her missing panties. Her only serious thought about that, upon the  resurgence of her natural persona, was a kind of relief at being spared the  indignity of at least one article of feminine undergarment. She had tolerated  the bra and stockings only because removing them would have drawn immediate  comment. She had not expected to be undressing in front of Nodoka. Naturally,  the moment she dropped her guard, that was exactly what she let happen!</p><p>Ranma stiffened. In spite of herself, she barked, "Shit!"</p><p>"Ranneko!"</p><p>Ranma thought fast, her mouth already moving into defense  mode, "This isn't what it looks like!" That denial immediately brought to mind  what it did look like, though. Since it had been the topic of two private  conversations between them, Nodoka did not need any encouragement to suspect  that the girl had indulged in the very thing the woman had so carefully  cautioned against. While  it worried  Nodoka that the girl would have rushed ahead and sated her passion, it was more  upsetting to think she would deceive her or deny what she had done after Nodoka  had brought the subject out into the open. It signified a lack of trust or  respect that was disturbing. Ignoring the girl's protests, Nodoka knelt down,  carefully examining the girl's body for evidence of the truth. Pausing at the  level of her crotch, and spying a string dangling between the girl's legs, the suspicions  that had popped into her mind suddenly retreated a bit.</p><p>"You use tampons," Nodoka noted idly, sitting back on her  heels. It suddenly seemed so obvious, she silently cursed herself for assuming  the worst. She thought a moment, then hypothesized aloud, "You didn't have a  purse until I gave you one, so you could not have had anything with you. I take  it you are early, and your panties were already ruined when you found a tampon  dispenser?"</p><p>Ranma did not even try to work out Nodoka's logic, she  just nodded. Nodoka quietly apologized for almost jumping to conclusions, but  Ranma silently thanked the kami that she had, at least in a favorable  direction. The two remained silent as they finished undressing and washed.  Ranma concentrated carefully on keeping her eyes from focusing on her mother  until they were both up to their necks in the furo.</p><p>"Did you just break up with him?" Nodoka finally broke  the silence.</p><p>Ranma nodded.</p><p>"I am sorry. Everything was going so well before the truth  came out. I hope this teaches you a lesson about deception, young lady," Nodoka  pursed her lips sternly.</p><p>"In more ways than you know," Ranma sighed. "You wanted  to talk to me about Ryouga?" she asked, hoping to spur the conversation toward  it's end.</p><p>"Actually, I wished to clarify some things about you and  Ranko." Nodoka cleared her throat and asked, "The curse that affects my son,  does it affect you or your sister?"</p><p>"Um. It affected both of us. It's part of what made us  like one person."</p><p>"I see." Nodoka thought for a moment. "Is that why Ranma  was helping Ranko, because this curse is responsible for her condition?"</p><p>"It's better to say, an attempt to cure it is."</p><p>"When you declined my offer to adopt you, was that  because you were not Ranko, or because you sincerely fear that you, or her, are  in peril of dying?"</p><p>"Some of both. There was always the risk that Ranko, or  I, would not survive a cure that benefited Ranma. There still is," she  explained.</p><p>"Are you saying my son is willing to let you two die for  him?" Nodoka asked in a pained voice. She was shocked when Ranma's head snapped  up and she stared at Nodoka as if she had been stabbed through the gut.  Unwittingly, the question had landed on the rawest nerve in her psyche. Her  reluctance to share her discovery was tantamount to just that, cowardice.</p><p>Ranma swallowed hard and tried to find some way to  answer. It suddenly helped that Ranma was not exactly "himself" at the moment.  Her mind, racing for most of the evening, was primed perfectly, and the words  she needed began to cascade through her mind. "N-Nodoka, I can't tell you how  much he has risked and sacrificed already. You have no idea what a threat this  curse is to his manhood, or how hard he has tried to remain worthy of being  your son—a man-among-men." She slapped her hand to her breastbone and cried, "I  am that threat! Ranko is that threat! To save Ranko, he will have to do  something you could never forgive, something that would violate the contract  irrevocably. He can save her life, he can rid himself of the curse forever, but  then… then he would die for breaking a promise his stupid, ignorant, idiot of a  father made on his behalf!"</p><p>"Ranneko! Surely that cannot be! How could saving a  girl's life be unmanly by any stretch of the imagination!"</p><p>"I can't tell you that without damning him here and now.  What I can say is, it's not the curse that unmans him. It's the things it  forces on him, the situations he has to face, the price he has to pay to get  what she needs to survive." She put her hands over her face. "It's him or us. I  can tell you this, there are a lot of people who want him more than me. What  about you. If you had to chose between him or me, who would you want to live?"</p><p>"I want my son to live, of course, but not at your  expense."</p><p>"I don't know how Ranko and I can survive without it  costing Ranma his life. For Ranma to survive, both the curse and the contract,  Ranko could, and I certainly would, die. That's what makes it a curse," she  sighed. "Ranma knows that the manly thing to do is to sacrifice himself. It's  safe to say, he knows you would expect that of him. I can't let him do that for  me, but I can't stop him from doing it for Ranko. It's his decision that can  save her. It's not his decision to save me. It would be kind of stupid to let  myself die, though, if ends up dead because of the contract. Don't you think?"</p><p>"I had no idea he… you… faced such drastic choices."</p><p>"If I were your son, what would you have me do?"</p><p>"In this matter, only your conscience can decide," Nodoka  cupped the girl's cheek, aching with sadness. "You, as much as my son, need to  do what you feel is right. What is most honorable. The sacrifices are asked of  you, not me, nor anyone else. If you must choose between honor and integrity,  do not betray the latter. Honor can be restored."</p>
