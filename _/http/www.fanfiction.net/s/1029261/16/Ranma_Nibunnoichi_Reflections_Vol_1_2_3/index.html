</div><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma Nibunnoichi - Reflections</p><p style="text-align:center;">A. V. Morgan</p><p style="text-align:center;">Part Sixteen: The Drowned Girl</p><p>The heavens continued to weep,  despite the absence of a certain kendoist to comment on it, as the group waited  for their train, at the station servicing the town nearest to Mirror Mansion.  Cologne had quietly observed the three aspects of Ranma, following the scene on  the road, waiting in particular to confront the "cured" boy when she got the  chance. The opportunity came at the train station, when the girls separated on  the way to the platform. One went to retrieve the books Ranma-chan had gotten  from Dr. Tofu from the locker they had rented before their trek to the mansion,  and the other to find Ryouga and lead him to the correct platform. Ranma seemed  too distracted to notice he had been left alone with the amazon matriarch. The  old woman perched on the back of a bench and tapped Ranma on the shoulder.</p><p>"You did not stop to consider what you would lose for a  cure, did you Son-in-law?" she challenged the boy softly, reminding him of the  scene at the yatai. When they had reached the town, Ranma, Ranko and Ranma-chan  had crowded around a yatai, the instant they scented food, nearly frightening  the vendor with their hungry faces and growling stomachs. Ryouga and Cologne  had paused, considering the risk to their health if they dared to come between  the Saotome triplets and food in the process of placing their own orders. The  street vendor recovered quickly, after he realized the quantity of food being  ordered would make up for the business lost due to rain, and threw in a  complementary serving for the red-headed twins, much to the disgust of Ranma  and Ryouga. Aside from trading dirty looks, a few red-eyes and a little  grumbling, the trio focused all their attention on inhaling their food while  Cologne exchanged a bit of gossip with the cook. She could not help but notice  the hint of venom in the way the girls took their little revenge on the cured  boy.</p><p>Ranma turned to look at the old ghoul and snorted. "I  wouldn't have thought about losing out on free food if they hadn't rubbed my  nose in it," he looked away, pretending to be indifferent.</p><p>"Oh, you lost a bit more than free food. Wouldn't you  say?"</p><p>"What? You think I actually liked bein' a girl half of  the time!"</p><p>"Oh, we both know my prejudices, but since it seems a  worthy question, perhaps you'd care to answer it," she prodded.</p><p>"Huh?" he snapped back around to stare at her.</p><p>"Did you?"</p><p>"Of course not!"</p><p>"Oh, that's an easy answer," she dismissed. "Why don't  you put some thought into it?"</p><p>"What's there to think about? I'm finally cured. The  price is… it really sucks. I mean, they're both me, and they're both stuck with  the curse in one way or the other, and I don't know which one has it worse!" he  confessed, keeping his voice low, but unable to keep his feelings out of it.</p><p>"That's a bit more intelligent, but it doesn't answer the  question, now does it?" Cologne hopped onto the arm rest so he could turn and  face her more easily from the bench. Seeing the confusion on his face, she  prompted, "Everything they know, up to the last hour, you know. You heard what  Ranma-chan said on the road, did you not?"</p><p>He scowled, "Yeah. I heard it. But what's the point of  worryin' about it? I'm just a guy now. I don't have to think about bein' a girl  no more, and it's probably better if I don't. Maybe there's something to like,  I really didn't get a chance to find out. The point is, I don't wanna like it.  I have enough to worry about." Ranma crossed his arms and looked at the tracks  again.</p><p>Cologne sighed. "If the other two are like you, which is  practically certain, they will no doubt choose to think the same way."</p><p>"What are you getting at?"</p><p>"That should be simple enough for you to guess,  Son-in-law," Cologne criticized. With a dignified harrumph, she interjected,  "So it goes, the Elders cling to life and mete out spoonfuls of wisdom to  children who can not trouble themselves to think. What is the world coming to?"</p><p>Ranma frowned and retorted, "I'm not an idiot, Cologne. I  know what they're going through, and I know what they think. I spent my life on  the road, so I know that the only thing I really have is myself. 'S all anyone  has, really, and if life takes that away from you…" Ranma trailed off. The  voices of the two girls could be heard coming closer. He turned and looked at  them, each carrying a stack of books and trying to guide Ryouga along verbally.</p><p>"Your OTHER left, Ryouga! Geez! Can't you just keep your  eyes on us and follow?" one of them was shouting.</p><p>"Shut up, Ranma!"</p><p>"Ranko," came the tired reply.</p><p>"It's all the same thing!"</p><p>"I wish!"</p><p>Ranma returned his gaze to Cologne and dropped his voice,  "Bein' Ranko wouldn't be that bad. I mean, she was right, I'd still be me. But  I would not look forward to life as a girl." His eyes turned to watch as Ranko  tossed her pile to Ranma-chan and chased off after Ryouga. "She's better than  him. She always will be, but if she ends up with him she'll always be treated  as less than him. She'll spend her time raising a bunch of brats who can't even  find their way to the bathroom, and everything she has invested in the Art will  wither away. She'll never be able to open a dojo or train, cuz no one will  respect a female sensei. Even if you ignore everything my Pops says about  girls, all of that is still true in Japan," he explained.</p><p>"Sadly, that is true of most of the world," Cologne  sighed.</p><p>"There's more though," Ranma added. "If she chooses to be  a girl, she'll have to go somewhere else, leave Nerima, or she'll never really  be accepted as a girl. To everyone around her, she's a guy in a female body.  The girls will never really accept her and the guys will mock her. The other  one will have it worse, though. The curse will never stay hidden long enough  for her to be accepted as a guy or a girl."</p><p>"Why do you refer to that one as 'her'?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Well, for the most part, she is you. She is the  original, and originally a boy. I think it's safe to say she's a man in her own  mind, so why do you see her as female?"</p><p>"You're doing it too," he pointed out.</p><p>"Well, from me, ascribing the female gender is a sign of  respect. You don't have the same excuse," the matriarch pointed out.</p><p>Ranma stared at her, trying to figure it out. The girl in  question had closed the remaining distance and he could not comment further  without her hearing.</p><p>"I can't believe that idiot!" Ranma-chan huffed, dropping  the pile of medical tomes on the bench beside Ranma. "I swear, we took our eyes  off him for a second and he found his way into a utility closet!"</p><p>"Ryouga could get lost in a room with no corners or  doors," Ranma chuckled. He picked up one of the books and examined the title.  "This is a lot of reading. We're gonna have to divide it up and break it down  for each other if we're going to start training this week."</p><p>"Well, we read some of it on the train here, we can get  in another hour on the way back," Ranma-chan noted, leaning over to see which  book he was looking at. "I already marked some sections for us to try tonight.  It would be nice if we knew someone who had read all of these and used them.  Dr. Tofu might have, but he doesn't have much time to spare."</p><p>"Why don't you speak to Happosai?" Cologne put in. "I  know he is rather difficult, but there are few people alive who know as much  about combining shiatsu and chi techniques. My own expertise is reserved for  members of the tribe, so I am limited in what I can reveal to you. Unless, of  course…"</p><p>"Don't say it. You promised you wouldn't use this to  force me into marrying Shampoo," Ranma and Ranma-chan said together. They  looked at each other. "Uh oh. We synched."</p><p>/ "Even though you're a girl?" Ranma asked. "Oh. Almost."</p><p>\ "Even though I am a girl?" Ranma-chan asked. "Oh.  Almost."</p><p>"That is both amusing and disturbing," Cologne smiled.  "Sort yourselves out, then. To return to my point, Happosai is the grandmaster  of your school. Seeing as you are, collectively, his best student, I am sure he  would take the matter seriously enough to be of use."</p><p>"Uh, well. I sort of… trapped him in a mirror," the two  winced. "I think he'd be too pissed to help if we tried to let him out to ask  him."</p><p>"You have a mirror trap? Hmmm. Not hard to guess where  that came from. Well, where is it?"</p><p>"At home."</p><p>"Very well then. I'll come along and go in to explain the  situation to Happi so you can let him out without turning all of Nerima upside  down." As she concluded, Ranko could be seen coming around the corner again,  with Ryouga in tow. They arrived just in time for the train. As it pulled into  the station, the group gathered up the books. A few minutes later, they were  all in their seats, the trio absorbed in medical texts, and on their way home.</p><p>Outside the windows of the  hurtling train, the landscape of Tokyo suburbs flashed by. In spite of the fact  that train rides were unusual for Ryouga, taken more by chance than by intent,  he was oblivious to the sights outside the glass. There seemed to be little  reason for him to join the Saotome triplets in perusing the medical texts,  since the only personal benefit he could expect from their endeavor would  depend on their finding a cure for the mirror's curse and him being tempted to  risk the same sort of division. He was not even thinking of that much, as  compared to the consequences of either outcome to this strange situation. It  was still sinking in that the Ranma he knew could die because of the  reflections. That possibility was manifest in his decision to grant his  mother's wishes for a manly son and a womanly daughter.</p><p>As he continued to study the girl who had stolen his  heart, and mourned for the fact that she was no longer quite the same girl as  Copy-chan, he thought about Ranma-chan's pronouncement. Ranko was a female  identity, not just an alias of Ranma. The two red-heads sitting side by side  across the aisle from him, heads bent over their books, both yearned to be  Ranma, but the boy sitting next to Ryouga had already trumped their claim. For  both of them, the only lingering claim on who they were was to embrace that  feminine identity.</p><p>The very idea was torturing Ryouga.</p><p>The events of the afternoon were nagging at him  mercilessly. It was strange that the clarity of his thoughts and feelings had  been shattered the instant his goal of finding Copy-chan had been fulfilled.  When she jumped on him outside the mansion, he had panicked. He had instantly  tried to deny his feelings, dreaded his attraction to the girl and freaked out  at her advances. Before he could even gather his wits, he had lost her. Though  he had responded to her request for his protection, he could not save her from  being overwhelmed by Ranma's memory. He had tried to be brave about it, when  she rejected his touch. Even as he pointed out his fallibility, wrestling with  his affections with Akane and Akari, he grieved over the loss of Copy-chan. She  had been so sweet, so innocent, so passionate, and he had wasted the little  time she'd had hating her because of her origin in Ranma. Now she was Ranma, in  mind, and he hated himself for still wanting her.</p><p>He could not even hate Ranma for this, though it really  was Ranma who had taken her away forever. No, it was Ranma's fault, but all that  was left of her was now a part of Ranma. A part of all three of them. At first,  that had been a very abstract notion, but after witnessing Ranma-chan's actions  in the rain, after hearing her declaration, there was no doubt that the girl he  loved was still there. Worse, while one part of his mind linked her to Ranko,  what survived of Copy-chan's physical existence, another part now clung to her  in Ranma-chan. Her words, her actions, had revealed that Copy-chan's spirit  endured in her. <i>"Oh yeah, it happened when I was in love with you," </i>she  had said, when he asked if she wanted to be a girl. Her spirit had looked out  of Ranma-chan's eyes at that moment, and Ryouga's heart had lurched painfully  in his chest. Somehow, he had understood that she was referring to both the koi  rod and the time she had spent as Copy-chan, and he had finally realized that  the girl he loved had always been in Ranma, showing only when the boy dropped  his guard. It had been torturing him since. The girl—no, the person—he loved  was Ranma.</p><p>As much as he hated the persona that was Ranma, the  person inside the personality had always drawn Ryouga. That was why he had  always felt so injured by Ranma's coarse manner, rude insults and taunting  behavior. It just killed him that the person he wanted to respect him most  belittled him the worst. It really pissed him off that Ranma treated Akane the  same way. Actually, the similarity of Ranma's treatment of them was one of the  pillars of his affection for Akane. Sympathy. Ranma's abuse was the thing they  had most in common. It made them natural allies, and had drawn them together  several times. Now that he really was thinking about it, the other thing that  drew him to Akane was that, of the people he had become most familiar with, she  was the most like Ryouga himself. He could not help laughing as he suddenly  pictured Akane as the female version of himself.</p><p>Ranma, Ranko and Ranma-chan looked up from their reading  to stare at Ryouga in annoyed curiosity. "What's so funny, P-chan?" they asked  in unison. Ryouga just laughed harder as the question hit him in  surround-sound. "I think he's snapped," they all observed together, then  noticed they had synched up. "Oh great!" they all sighed.</p><p>Cologne, after glancing out the window, cleared her  throat and announced, "We're coming into Nerima. Put the books away and get  ready to go. We should hurry home so I can talk to Happosai and see if we can  get him to help out."</p><p>That sobered everyone up. Happosai had made a point of  the fact that he had never learned anything intended to help people, and while  he often had provided assistance to people it usually served to further his own  perverted ends. Preserving the boon of multiple Ranma-chans was probably  sufficient motivation for him to chip in on the effort, but it was certain to  cause as much trouble as it resolved. This thought remained on their minds as  the train pulled into the station and they all marched onto the platform. As  they filed out of the station, Ranma-chan turned to address Cologne. "Are you  sure you want him to get involved in this?" she asked with a shiver.</p><p>"Absolutely not. I must say I'd prefer you kept him  locked up for eternity, but there is no challenging the fact that his expertise  in this area exceeds that of anyone alive, outside of the tribe," Cologne  reasserted. "I did give my word I would not pressure you to join the tribe, but  it would be necessary before I can offer unconditional assistance."</p><p>"And that would mean marrying Shampoo," they guessed.</p><p>"That is the only option with the necessary expedience,"  Cologne nodded. "You might not have enough time to pursue an alternative method  of adoption into the tribe. The laws governing such possibilities are the most  strict and unyielding in our tribe. Our people have suffered too many tragedies  as the result of trusting outsiders."</p><p>"Tell me about it," Ranko muttered.</p><p>Cologne froze and turned to look at the girl. The look on  the girl's face sent a chill into the matriarch's bones. With studied  casualness, she shifted into her native tongue and prompted the girl to  continue, "Perhaps you could enlighten the others, child."</p><p>There was something about the tone of Cologne's speech,  as she had commented on the basis for the severe laws of the Amazons, that had  touched on a corner of Ranko's mind. She had spoken without even thinking, and  responded to the prompt just as thoughtlessly. "Well, for more than a thousand  years," she began, falling into perfect Mandarin while her gaze turned inward,  "we accepted any woman who asked for sanctuary within the tribe, without  suspicion. They had to earn status and rights through their efforts, of course,  but they were never subjected to testing. It never occurred to us that our  enemies would use the spring of drowned woman and lock their curses to  infiltrate the tribe. My mother never forgave herself for prompting the idea  when she took refuge from the Musk among the Amazons. Only the fact that the  infiltrators first tried to abduct Pa Shen gave us any warning of the threat,"  Ranko explained, almost entranced by the memory.</p><p>Ranko blinked to erase the image of carnage that  accompanied the painful memory. She then noticed the perplexed looks on Ranma  and Ryouga's faces, Ranma-chan's pallor at the shared memory, and Cologne's  stone expression.</p><p>"When did you learn to speak Mandarin?" Ryouga demanded  in the pause. When Ranko stared back in confusion, Ryouga elaborated, "I've  picked up a lot of languages in my travels, but I'm not that good with  Mandarin. Cologne said something in Mandarin and you replied fluently. I only  understood part of it."</p><p>"I didn't get any of it," Ranma grumbled.</p><p>Ranma-chan looked from him to her twin, then turned to  Cologne. "I didn't even realize she was speaking another language. I  understood. I even remembered the events she was talking about, but… I don't  remember where from. It's like suddenly remembering a dream," she confided.</p><p>Cologne just stared at the girls. There it was, simple as  that. It was true. Ranma was the reincarnation of Fa Shen. Both of the girls  had tapped into the memory of that forgotten life. "Have you ever experienced  this before?" she asked cautiously.</p><p>Both girls nodded. Even Ranma perked up and nodded. The  twins looked at him, and let him speak, since he had precedence. "It's kind of  strange now, but it happened when I was Copy-chan," he began. The other two  nodded and he went on. "The stuff that Kuno tried to choke down my throat at  the end of the date…" he shivered as he realized that he would always carry  these memories. "It all mixed together and knocked me for a loop. While I was  passed out I had this dream. I was at Jusenkyo, and this big battle had ended.  The men were ravaging the women from my party and I was being strangled and  stripped by this guy…" He blanched as he realized the man reminded him of Genma,  or the panda he turned into. "The leaders stopped him from raping me, but they  tied me up and threw me into a spring. I drowned…"</p><p>"I think I was remembering the death of the girl who  created the Nyanniichaun," Ranko interjected.</p><p>"Fa Shen," Ranma-chan added. She scratched her head and  studied the matriarch. "Have you ever heard of a cursed person discovering the  memories of the person or animal their curse is based on?"</p><p>Cologne sighed and nodded. "Yes, I have. It is a very  rare occurrence, and it only happens for one reason. The curses seem very  arbitrary in how they affect their victims, but the secret, the difference  between effects, is based on similarities between the victim and the curse.  Each spring has a number of different effects that can be emphasized. Usually,  it is the greatest difference that governs the curse. If the biggest difference  is species, that is the prominent effect. If the biggest difference is sex,  that is the focus of the effect. If the victim is the same species and gender,  then the personality of the victim is cursed. Every spring has the ability to  impose the exact form of the original victim, but over time that becomes very  rare. You and Herb were cursed by the same pool, but Herb's curse turns him  into a female version of himself. Your curse turns you into a twin of Fa Shen."</p><p>"Is that why we can remember something from her life?"</p><p>"No," Cologne responded. "Not precisely. Even the  personality curses do not grant the memory of the person who imprinted the  pool. It is true, however, that the pools do capture the mind and spirit of the  original victims. A part of the soul lingers in the pool as well, while the  rest is free to be reincarnated. When a person is cursed with the exact form of  the original, it is because the ghost has attempted to merge with the victim to  escape from its grave. That would allow the victim to gain the memory of the  original, but it only succeeds if the victim happens to be a reincarnation of  the original."</p><p>They all stared at her.</p><p>The storm that had raced in  from the countryside had apparently decided to park itself over Nerima. While  it endeavored to flood the drainage canals of the ward, the students of  Furinkan High lingered in the halls, grumbling as they slipped on their outdoor  shoes and crowded around the umbrella rack in vain hope of finding a loaner  umbrella for the walk home. Akane and Ukyo paused as they saw Kodachi rush in  from outside and sprint to where Tatewaki was waiting beside Nabiki. The middle  Tendo daughter had already sold the legitimate story explaining Ranma's absence  from school, but a specially tailored version was reserved for the Kuno  siblings. The two official fiancées turned and followed the three as they  headed into a classroom. Nabiki raised an eyebrow as Akane and Ukyo filed into  the room, but ignored their presence with a shrug. Turning to the siblings, she  cleared her throat.</p><p>"I am glad you could both make it here," she began. "I am  afraid I have some bad news for both of you about the curse afflicting Ranma  and the Pig-Tailed-Girl."</p><p>"Tendo Nabiki, in light of all the rumors flourishing in  the halls of this learning institution, I deemed it necessary to confer with  you in hopes of illuminating the truth," Tatewaki spouted.</p><p>"My brother contacted me and informed me that the rabble  of this school have begun speaking of some mortal peril facing my beloved  Ranma-sama," Kodachi posed in anguish. "I am troubled that such rumors imply  that it has become widely known that my beloved is accursedly bound to that  harridan!"</p><p>"As the situation has become a danger to the health and  well-being of Ranma and the Pig-Tailed-Girl, requiring that they be excused  from school, there was no way the student body would not learn the details,"  Nabiki dismissed the implication that she had divulged information they had  paid so dearly to acquire. Rather than elaborate, she cut to the chase. "The  bad news is simply this. The curses affecting Ranma and the Pig-Tailed-Girl  have bound them to each other with a fatal flaw. If the two of them are physically  separated for any great length of time, they will both sicken and die. If, for  any other reason, one of them dies, the other will die as well."</p><p>"Say it isn't so!"</p><p>"How can this be?"</p><p>"It's true. This has been confirmed by experts, so I warn  you to keep it in mind if you value their lives. Because of the vulnerability  of their condition, they cannot be exposed to certain risks that exist at  school. Since that vulnerability also applies to being separated, the worst  thing you could do is repeat what you tried in the park yesterday."</p><p>"But, you can't mean we must give up all hope of dating  them!"</p><p>"There must be some way of undoing this tragic bond!"</p><p>"Right now, they are working on finding a solution. I  recommend that you restrain yourselves and allow them time to figure it out,"  Nabiki warned them sternly. Of course, she had to throw them a bone. "One of  the things that became clear, however, is that it could be fatal for them to  become intimate. In order to prevent this, they have essentially broken up.  That's the doom of the curse, to be bound to each other, but unable to risk  consummating that bond." It was sort of a perversion of the truth, but she  stated it in a way that would temper the Kunos' reactions. "You won't see them  fawning over each other again," she promised them.</p><p>The siblings eyes widened hopefully. Their failure the  previous afternoon had grated on them both. Unable to fathom the reaction of  their dates as genuine rejection, they clung to the idea that Ranma and the  Pig-Tailed-Girl were driven by the warped dictates of the curse that was, as  Nabiki insisted, designed to destroy them. It made a kind of sense that a curse  that lured them to death in each other's arms would also drive them away from  those who might come to their succor. Apparently the couple had become aware of  their peril and now endeavored to thwart their doom.</p><p>"Is there nothing we can do to aid them?" Kuno asked.</p><p>"Sure," Nabiki shrugged, "Don't fight with them. Don't  interfere with them. Do not try to separate them from each other. Make sure  that Hinnako never uses her attacks on them. The rest is up to them and the  experts."</p><p>The pair considered that thoughtfully. The idea that the  well being of the objects of their affection was dependant on that of their  rivals was a bitter pill to swallow. Worse, they both held the opinion that  their rivals lacked the ability to resist the charms of their beloveds. It  would be up to them to keep an eye on them somehow and ensure that they did not  succumb to temptation. Rather than expose their intentions, they thanked Nabiki  for the update and departed.</p><p>"I don't like it," Akane said after they left. "They took  that a lot better than I would expect. Those two have never backed down in the  face of reality. They're going to be trouble again, I just know it."</p><p>"We just need to make sure that Ran-chan and the copies  never face them alone," Ukyo proposed. "The trick is to find a way to protect  them without them realizing that's what we're doing. It'd hurt their pride too  much to let someone defend them."</p><p>"None of them are vulnerable to any physical threat,"  Nabiki countered. "It's the treachery those two are capable of that's the real  danger."</p><p>They sighed and headed outside to walk home. Although  Ukyo burned to accompany them to the dojo and see Ranma, she had a business to  run. With a heavy heart she bid them farewell at her turn and rushed to her  restaurant. Akane and Nabiki trudged on through the rain, sharing the umbrella  Nabiki had snagged earlier in the day with predictable foresight. Arriving  home, they discovered that the others had arrived home just ahead of them.</p><p>Akane followed Nabiki into the Tea Room where the  triplets were sitting around the table pouring through books. Off to the side,  Ryouga was sipping tea and talking quietly with Kasumi. Seeing him, Akane  smiled, remembering what she had been musing over in class. As Kasumi welcomed  her sisters home, and presented snacks, Akane and Nabiki made their way to the  table. Before Akane could think of a way to interrupt the reading trio, Nabiki  suddenly spoke up.</p><p>"What's the trap mirror doing out on the table?"</p><p>Ranma looked up and answered, "Hey, Akane. Nabiki.  Cologne thinks Happosai might be able to help us. She went in to talk to him,  and calm him down so we can let him out and ask."</p><p>Akane and Nabiki stared at him for a second. Because the  boy next to him had hair and clothes slightly more damp that the others, they  had assumed he was Ranma, but when the other boy spoke they both felt a nagging  sense that he was the real Ranma. It was not so much that his mannerisms gave  him away, because the copies had inherited such things. It was something more  subtle. Something in his eyes and expression that had never been in Copy-kun.  The boy who greeted and answered them had more self awareness, more confidence  in himself.</p><p>"How long has she been in there?" Nabiki asked, reaching  out to pick the compact mirror up to examine it.</p><p>"I dunno," he shrugged. "Maybe half an hour. She went in  just after we got back. It's about time to let them out, though." Nabiki opened  the mirror and turned it over. She waited for him to nod before patting it on  the back. Fortunately, she had turned slightly away, so the pile of lingerie  that accompanied the diminutive elders did not swamp the table and bury those  sitting around it.</p><p>"Hot damn! I was getting tired of bein' cooped up in  there!" Happosai crowed as he landed lightly on his feet, followed by Cologne.  The water balloon he lobbed caught Ranma off guard right in the face. The  splash caught Ranma-kun, sitting beside him, and triggered the curse. "Well,  I'll be damned! I thought I was aiming for the right one!" He picked up a towel  from the edge of the table, still slightly damp from when Ranma-chan last used  hot water, and pounced on the girl. "Here, Ranma-chan! Let Grandpa Happosai dry  you off!" he cried as he buried himself in her bosom.</p><p>Nabiki and Akane did a double take during the  transformation. They had been positive they had spotted the real Ranma too.  While Ranma-chan, with assistance from Ranko, tried to subdue the perverted  martial arts master, Ranma looked up and silently mouthed a thank-you.</p><p>"Happi," Cologne's voice cut in, in a warning tone, "you  promised not to start trouble." She looked around and hopped up to the table.  Kasumi was on hand to offer a cup of tea to the old woman. After thanking the  eldest daughter, the matriarch took a sip, then addressed the room. "Now that  everyone is home, it's time to explain where things stand. Could someone please  summon the fathers?"</p><p>Kasumi rose and went out to call Soun and Genma in from  the dojo. Happosai retreated from the red-heads' attempt to pulverize him,  tucking a bra filched from Ranko into his gi, and settled next to Cologne.  Though she noticed his prize, she was too shocked by the fact that the girl had  been wearing one to glare at Happosai. Once the fathers had come in and joined  everyone at the table, Cologne quickly related the events of the day.  Naturally, she did not spare the youths in her recapitulation. Ranma, Ranko and  Ranma-chan all blushed as hard as Ryouga when she described the meeting between  them at the mansion. There were a few exclamations as she detailed the  examination of the mirror and the events of the exorcism. Cologne confessed her  own surprise that the procedure had restored all their memories so quickly.</p><p>"So, Boy," Genma interrupted, "you remember everything  now?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. Ranma-chan explained the discovery of their  ability to fall into perfect synch, and how that compelled them to establish an  order of precedence, designating the boy as Ranma and the girl as Ranko, as  well as the necessity for her to retain a claim to both identities or else  perish.</p><p>"Unless what we discovered returning from the train  station can be taken into account," Cologne interrupted the cursed teen. The  triplets froze at that. They had been in shock after Cologne's revelation that  Ranma was the reincarnation of the drowned girl. They had not responded as she  clarified that Fa Shen had been an amazon prodigy revered since the time of her  death. Sensing they had brain lock, she had dropped the subject until now.</p><p>To their relief, Genma bulldozed past the matriarch's  comment to pursue his own interest. "That seems a sensible solution, at least  until the matter of the bleeding is resolved. However, in light of the fact  that the boy is Ranma, it is time for him to assume the responsibilities of my  son. I have discussed this with Tendo-kun, and he agrees that the boy takes  precedence in the engagement. I hope you find this arrangement more suitable,  Akane."</p><p>Akane gulped and turned to stare at him. This was  happening too fast. "I don't see how I can object. This is essentially what  Ranma proposed," she admitted, referring to the conversation they had that  morning. "I just didn't expect this to be resolved so quickly." She turned to  Ranma-chan and Ranko and placed a hand over one of each of theirs. "I do want  to remain friends with you. Both of you. Nothing has changed in that respect,"  she tried to placate.</p><p>They took her hands and squeezed them gently. They  understood that the gesture was her way of assuring them that she did not hold  their escape from the engagement against them. "Sorry 'bout this," they  murmured in unison.</p><p>"It's not your fault. You just focus on finding a  solution so none of you have to die, okay?"</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>Cologne resumed her narration, which quickly reached the  point she had been debating since it had come up. The revelation about Fa Shen  had some so unexpectedly. She had not had time to decide whether or not to  share it with his friends and family, and cursed herself for saying as much as  she did in her excitement. Fortunately, the need for secrecy was over. The fact  was established and she could announce it with confidence. There was no risk of  looking like a fool now. Bringing out the book she had made the others stop by  the Cat Café to pick up, she cleared her throat. "There is one final matter  which had come to light as a result of this fiasco," she announced, opening the  book to the page she had marked. "Thanks to the stupidity of Kuno, Copy-chan  had a near death experience and tapped into some memories that confirm one of  the strangest legends of Jusenkyo." She quickly told them of ancient stories  that claimed that souls of those who died in the springs could be resurrected  through the power of the curse afflicting a reincarnation of that individual.  "In Ranma's case, there is a record of the girl who drowned in that spring  allowing us to confirm the memories they have inherited."</p><p>The others leaned in to examine the portrait revealed in  the open book. It was a photograph of an exquisitely detailed painting that had  been pasted carefully to the thick page. The girl it depicted could be none  other than Ranma's cursed form.</p>
