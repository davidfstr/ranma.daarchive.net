</div><p>Scenes from Nerima 6</p><p>The DigiSim Files</p><p><b><i>As always, my thanks go out to Andrew Eoff, a.k.a. Dkun, for starting  this fic as well as Gregg Sharp and Stephen Schlueter for continuing it. I also  want to thank burgerbill, Carrotglace, Hung Nguyen and kokatsu na tenshi for  giving their permission to let me use some of their fics as blooper material.  I'd be out of ideas in no time otherwise. Let the silliness begin.</i></b></p><p><b>Nodoka:</b> Ranma,  that wasn't very manly of you.</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Mom,  please get off my ass.</p><p><i>The cast and crew  break out in laughter.</i></p><p><b>Ranma</b> <i>(sounding a little surprised)</i><b>:</b> You know that came out…so naturally.</p><p><b>Kuno:</b> Were I to  count the clock that tells the time and see the brave day sunk into hideous  night that I…who the hell has been messing with my script?</p><p><i>Ranma is seen  tiptoeing off in the background with an evil grin on his face while the rest of  the cast laugh.</i></p><p><i>A red rubber ball with  a black elastic loop trailing from it and two tiny feet is seen scuttling  quickly along the floor in front of Ranma and Akane in the hall of Furinkan.</i></p><p><b>Akane:</b> What the  hell was that?</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> A running  gag.</p><p><i>Everybody groans.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> <i>What?</i></p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Just Add  Water Outtakes Scene 1</b></p><p>Ranma sighed for the third time. He sat in the little dining  room table of his Juuban apartment clutching the letter he got from Juuban   High School. Akane just shook her  head. "You know Ranma, the note you got from Dr. Tofu was going to be  questioned sooner or later. C'mon, did you think that a 'Back Problem' was an  excuse they would buy forever?"</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Sure I  did, especially if you think about what we do all day.</p><p><i>Akane blushes.</i></p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(groaning)</i><b>:</b> Ranma, I thought we discussed this. Stop bringing up what you do  with your sister.</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Sorry sir.</p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Just Add  Water Outtakes Scene 2</b></p><p>Ranma sighed for the third time. He sat in the little dining  room table of his Juuban apartment clutching the letter he got from Juuban   High School. Akane just shook her  head. "You know Ranma, the note you got from Dr. Tofu was going to be  questioned sooner or later. C'mon, did you think that a 'Back Problem' was an  excuse they would buy forever?"</p><p>Ranma knew what this meant. He was going to have to attend  gym classes. As a martial artist, he would have welcomed anything that would  have allowed him to train and maintain his body. But his curse had a dark side  and he wanted to avoid the problems he had while at Furinkan. "Well, I'm  getting an exam from the school nurse today. If I pass, I will be in gym shorts  in the afternoon."</p><p><i>Akane starts drooling.</i></p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(whining slightly)</i><b>:</b> <i>Why</i> did Takahashi-san  have to hire these <i>perverts</i>?</p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Just Add  Water Outtakes Scene 3</b></p><p>"Mr. Saotome! Please come in here." The school  nurse called Ranma into the little nursing station. Ranma earlier in the day  was trying out different ways to intentionally throw out his back, dislocate  his shoulder or annoy Akane to beat him senseless. He wanted to fail this exam.</p><p>The nurse took one look at Ranma and knew that the note from  Dr. Tofu must have been a misunderstanding. Ranma was a prime specimen of  maleness. His chest was solid muscle and his arms were fully defined. He had no  trace of fat on him and looked like he could take on Rambo without trying. The  nurse wondered why a person like this would want to be excused from gym class.  "Please remove your shirt." She pulled out a stethoscope to listen to  his heart.</p><p>The nurse had to resist wanting to run off with Ranma right  then and there. She saw his bare chest and wanted to bury herself in it. She  calmed down a bit and held the stethoscope against his ribs listening to his  lungs. "Inhale. Exhale." Lungs were fine, heart rate was low but that  was because he was in prime physical condition. She then slipped her hand down  the front of his pants and started fondling him.</p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(getting upset)</i><b>:</b> <i>What</i> do you think  you're doing?</p><p><b>Nurse:</b> Um,  checking him for a hernia?</p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(sighs)</i><b>:</b> First of all, a high school nurse <i>doesn't</i> do that, secondly he needs to be nude from the waist down,  and third what did you do with the real nurse Nodoka?</p><p><b>Nodoka</b> <i>(sounding surprised)</i><b>:</b> How did you know it was me?</p><p><b>Director:</b> Your  wig is slipping.</p><p><b>Nodoka:</b> <i>Oh.</i></p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(mumbling to himself)</i><b>:</b> Maybe I should have signed up to  direct 'Urusei Yatsura.' I doubt any of <i>that</i>  cast has perverts in it.</p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Just Add  Water Outtakes Scene 4</b></p><p>"What's wrong with Ranma?" Makoto asked Akane.</p><p>Akane stared at the grass. "Have you thought about what  life is like for Ranma with that curse of his?"</p><p>Ranko gave out a scream from inside the ladies' restroom. <i>"WHAT! IT'S BROKEN!"</i> She  bolted from the restroom and ran to the cafeteria.</p><p>Minako saw where Ranko was going, "I guess the hot  water isn't working in the restroom."</p><p>Ranko got to the cafeteria and cried out, "I need some  hot water! Can I get some?"</p><p>The attendant looked at Ranko with fear. This redhead was  psychotic, "We're closed." Ranko stomped the ground and threw her cup  down. <i>"ARGH!"</i> She took a  few deep breaths and slowly spoke with an air of defeat, "I guess it's  time to face the music." Ranko walked off to class holding her head down  with the excitement of a woman walking towards a guillotine.</p><p>Akane held back the other girls. "Rei, you should be  ashamed of yourself."</p><p><b>Rei:</b> I should?</p><p><b>Usagi</b> <i>(growling)</i><b>:</b> Rei, <i>quit</i> picking on my  <i>husband!</i></p><p><i>The director starts  sobbing.</i></p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Just Add  Water Outtakes Scene 5</b></p><p>The teacher rubbed his temples, "Miss, you will be  reporting to the principal's office if you don't stop this nonsense. Now, for  the last time, what is your name?"</p><p>"Fine! My name is Little Red Riding Hood! I'm hiding  from the Big Bad Wolf!" She crossed her arms and her face went flush with  anger.</p><p>"That's it!" He turned to Akane, "Akane,  please escort this troublemaker to the principal's office." He stormed off  to his desk and filled out a hall pass. Akane stood up and held out her hand to  Ranko. Ranko didn't get up. She stayed at her desk.</p><p>The teacher handed the hall pass to Akane and shot a look of  disapproval to Ranko. "Miss, please leave my classroom!" He turned to  Akane, "Akane, find your husband and get him in here or he will be given a  detention alongside this troublemaker."</p><p>Akane started twitching her eyebrows, "That  troublemaker is my <i>HUSBAND!</i>"</p><p>He looked at Ranko and back to Akane. "What sort of  joke is this? It is not funny and it's very disrespectful. Why are you trying  to pass this off as some sort of excuse for Ranma to miss this class?"</p><p>Ranko stood up, "We have magical girls running around  town blowing up youma and you can't accept the fact that I have a curse that  changes me into <i>THIS!</i>"</p><p><b>Teacher:</b> Oh, good  point. Okay then.</p><p><b>Director:</b> You're <i>not</i> supposed to agree with that.</p><p><b>Teacher:</b> I'm not?</p><p><b>Akane</b> <i>(shouting)</i><b>:</b> <i>SAOTOME, FOR WHAT YOU HAVE  DONE TO SHAMPOO</i>…wait a minute, that's not right.</p><p><i>Ranma chuckles while  the director groans.</i></p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Tunnel  Vision Outtakes Scene 1</b></p><p>Ranma and Akane hadn't been in Nerima for several weeks and  were happy to be back. They were visiting the Tendo dojo for the weekend.  Living in Juuban in their new apartment had been an adventure of boredom. Since  the wedding, there just hadn't been the usual number of psychos trying to  pummel, beat, maim, marry, kidnap or otherwise introduce mayhem into the Ranma  Saotome household. In fact, it was rather dull.</p><p><b>Ranma</b> <i>(looking at the narrator)</i><b>:</b> This is a problem <i>why?</i></p><p><b>Narrator:</b> <i>Um.</i></p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Tunnel  Vision Outtakes Scene 2</b></p><p>Ranma still taught the other Senshi martial arts to improve  the other's battle skills. These lessons were almost always in the form of a  guy. Sometimes that cursed old woman with the ladle happened to cross his path.  Without easy access to hot water at the dojo, the lesson was with Ranko.  However Usagi's whining was really getting on Ranma's nerves. How can this  crybaby become a queen someday? Seeing the stress in Ranma, Akane suggested  that they spent the weekend away from it all.</p><p>So in the span of two hours, the time it took to get from  the bus station to the Tendo dojo, Ranma was smacked with a battle spatula, ran  over with a bike, listened to really bad poetry and had someone demand payment  for his dad's debts. He also had four sex changes. Yes, nothing had changed in  Nerima.</p><p><b>Ranma</b> <i>(sighing)</i><b>:</b> Is it too late for a rewrite?</p><p><b>Usagi:</b> Ranma,  you're my husband and I love you but please shut up <i>(turning to glare at the narrator)</i> and who are <i>you</i> calling a crybaby.</p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Tunnel  Vision Outtakes Scene 3</b></p><p>"So, you are saying that you want me to leave? I've  never told anyone."</p><p>"No, no! It's not like that. It's that I want you to be  part of my life, but if my secret gets out then I'll have to distance myself  because you can get hurt. I can't live with myself if something was to happen  to you. Uh, it's err..." Ranko tried to find the right words that didn't  involve shoe leather. Carefully she says, "As long as no one knows, I can  be with you and you can be with us. Otherwise, bad things can happen. Please  don't tell dad or the Tendos or anyone else. I don't want anyone to get hurt  because of what we have become."</p><p>Mom looked at her daughters eyes and asked, "And what  have you become Ranko?"</p><p>"I don't know. But I do know this," Ranko then pulled  out a pair of Ray-Bans and slipped them on, "I make this look good."</p><p><i>Ranko and Nodoka crack  up.</i></p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Tunnel  Vision Outtakes Scene 4</b></p><p>"Sun you Jerk!" screamed Sailor Io as she once  again fired her Lava Blast at her currently female husband. As usual, Sailor  Sun stuck her tongue out and easily dodged her attack. Or she would have if she  hadn't tripped over a small rock in her path. The Lava Blast soared over her  head and headed off-screen where a howling scream was heard. Sun turned around  from where she was to see what the scream was while Io looked like she had all  the blood drained from her body.</p><p><b>Sun:</b> Oh nice  going sis. You turned the director into a crispy critter.</p><p><b>Io</b> <i>(starting to sob)</i><b>:</b> But I didn't <i>mean</i> to.</p><p><i>Ambulance sirens could  be heard in the background. Luckily the director lived but he never sat near  the camera during battle scenes ever again.</i></p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Tunnel  Vision Outtakes Scene 5</b></p><p>Ami, Rei and Makoto got together with Usagi, Akane and Ranma  during lunch break. Ami suggested that they all go to the mall after school. In  unison, the three late risers produced their detention slips with a dejected  look on their faces. Ami said, "Usagi! You have an alarm clock. Why don't  you use it?"</p><p>"I used it!" cried Usagi. "And I used the  snooze button at least three times and it still won't get me up in time for  school!"</p><p>"What else is new?" Ami sighed, she turned to  Ranma, "And what's your excuse Ranma?"</p><p>"Uh... Well we were..." Ranma stuttered.</p><p>"Training," said Akane. "Yes, we were  training again."</p><p>Rei smirked, "Let me guess, 8 hour time  difference?"</p><p>Makoto added, "So what's the damage this time?"</p><p>"Rocks, lots of rocks." Akane giggled, "Now  if I can get the rocks out of Ranma's head."</p><p>"Hey! I won fair and square." Ranma said.</p><p>"Rematch?"</p><p>"Any time!"</p><p>"Ok, bring it on!" Akane stood up and took a  fighting stance.</p><p>"Now, now you two," glared Makoto, "this  isn't Furinkan; we can't be starting fights here."</p><p>"Coming from a girl who was kicked out of school for  fighting, that is the pot calling the kettle black." Rei then took a sip  of her juice and just stretched out on the grass.</p><p>"Please sit down Akane and enjoy your lunch," Ami  said and looked at</p><p>Usagi's hungry eyes, "before it vanishes."</p><p>"Well, if you are not hungry..." pleaded Usagi.</p><p>"Usagi, how in the world do you not pork out?"  Ranma asked. "Akane and I have a strict workout routine so we burn up all  of our calories, but how do you do it?"</p><p><b>Usagi:</b> Sex, lots  and <i>lots</i> of sex. But being my  husband, you already knew that.</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Oh yeah.</p><p><b>Sailor Ranko Just Add  Water Outtakes Scene 6</b></p><p>Nabiki exited the subway station near the Tokyo  bay waterfront. This was going to be a profitable evening. She had a meeting  with Kuno to exchange yen for information. She didn't want to perform the  transaction at school. This information was extra juicy and worthy of a meeting  at a very expensive restaurant. Kuno of course will be buying. Nabiki grinned.  She knew exactly how to manage her pet.</p><p>She wore a smart business suit and skirt, heels and looked  the part of a lawyer about to show the damning evidence to clinch the case.  Only a set of fangs would have made the image of Nabiki fit what she had in  mind for the evening. She was going to suck Kuno dry.</p><p><b>Nabiki:</b> Thank god  he's gay and I don't have to do that for real. I'd prefer Ranma.</p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(shouting)</i><b>:</b> <i>Quit ad libbing!</i></p><p><b>Fist of the Pikachu  Outtakes Scene 1</b></p><p>"Whew! I thought I was going to stay like that  forever!" Ranma ran his hands over his chest and sighed in relief, as he  didn't find any additional fullness in his torso.</p><p>"Oh so sorry  sir! Cure is only temporary! Cold water will change into girl again! Hot water  change back!"</p><p>"Is there  any cure for this?"</p><p>"So sorry  sir! Not know cure! No good to try and go into Nanniichuan! Spring of Drowned  Man! Once cursed by Jusenkyo, waters of other springs no work!"</p><p>Ranma's anger came  back with a vengeance as he hauled up the battered body of his father. He shook  the panda back to a conscious state as he screamed in his face. "You and  your stupid ideas! You just had to drag me here, even though you don't know a  word of Chinese! <i>THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!</i>"</p><p>"Growf?"</p><p>That was all that  Genma Saotome could say before he was severely pummeled and then launched into  the air by way of an uppercut to the chin.</p><p>Ranma huffed as  he watched his old man soar up into the stratosphere and then went to retrieve  his backpack He then stomped off while muttering, "At least I got good  distance."</p><p><i>The director was just  scratching his head and wondering what he did wrong in a past life to be stuck  directing shows like this.</i></p><p><b>Fist of the Pikachu  Outtakes Scene 2</b></p><p>Within the  village of the Joketsuzoku, the matriarch known as Cologne  was busy adding the final ingredients to a bubbling cauldron. The three  hundred-year old Elder cackled as she drew a strange-looking amulet from her  robes and held it over the potion. Behind her, the other matriarchs watched  with apprehension.</p><p>"Are you  certain that you should be doing this?" Mascara asked.</p><p>"Why  not?" Cologne replied as  the smoke coming from the cauldron began to swirl around the amulet.  "It has been almost three hundred years since that treacherous  Happosai had stolen our treasures! With this amulet, we shall at last be able  to reclaim our lost magical talismans! This will be our only chance though! The  planets are in perfect alignment and the amulet will reach full power within  minutes after it is exposed to the vapors of the potion! It will then seek out  the mystical energies contained within our treasures and bring them to us,  wherever they may be! If Happosai is with them, then he shall be brought to us  as well and we shall exact our long-awaited revenge! That in itself justifies  the use of our last magical item, does it not?"</p><p>The Elders slowly  nodded as they too had long-standing grudges against the perverted master of  the Anything Goes Martial Arts. Cologne  then sneezed and accidentally dropped the amulet on the floor where it broke.</p><p><b>Cologne</b><b>:</b> <i>Damn  It!</i> That's the <i>fifth</i> one today!  Stinking arthritis!</p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(sighing)</i><b>:</b> Somebody call the prop department and put them on standby just in  case. And get me some antacid.

We don't know how  long we're stuck like this!" pleaded Carrot. "We've got to try and be  good roomies. Okay?"</p><p>"Roomies?" muttered Ranma in horror.</p><p>"Fine! We'll go your way! Don't come crying to me when  we end up in India!"  snapped Dan.</p><p>"Great!" said Carrot cheerfully. "So, how ya  doin, Ranma?"</p><p>That did it. "How am I doing? I'm a friggin girl! I'm  hearing two different voices inside my head, and I ain't walkin nowhere, but  somehow I am! How the hell do you think I'm doin!"</p><p>"Jeez, calm down. There's no need to blow a  gasket," said Carrot lazily.</p><p>"Calm down? <i>CALM  DOWN?</i> Are you nuts?" snapped Ranma. He then grasped his head in pain  as loud feedback reverberated in his ears and yanked off a hidden headset he  had been wearing.</p><p><b>Dan</b> <i>(in a sing-song voice off-camera)</i><b>:</b> Oh Mr. Director, Carrot dropped his  microphone.</p><p><b>Carrot</b> <i>(off-camera)</i><b>:</b> Oh blow it out your ass Dan.</p><p><b>Insertion Outtakes  Scene 2</b></p><p>Ranma was sitting at the table with the Tendos, seeming to  beam with pride as the panda glared at her angrily. None of the Tendos noticed  this, as they were focused on Soun's prone form on the ground just beside the  table. He had a cold cloth sitting across his forehead, and tears in his eyes.</p><p>"This is all your fault daddy!" said Nabiki.</p><p>"Well I assumed that my friend Saotome's son was a  boy!" snapped the man in retort.</p><p>"Hey! Aren't you going to cop another feel?" said  Ranma as she turned her head towards Nabiki and grabbed the girl's hand,  pulling it to her chest again.</p><p><b>Nabiki</b> <i>(shrugging)</i><b>:</b> Okay, sure.</p><p><i>Ranma-chan and Nabiki then  proceed to feel each other up.</i></p><p><i>The director is  huddled in a ball with a nearly empty bottle of whiskey resting next to his  head while sobbing quietly and mumbling about</i> 'damn perverts.'</p><p><b>Insertion Outtakes  Scene 3</b></p><p>Meanwhile...</p><p>Sailor Pluto frowned, something was wrong. A force of chaos  like no other had appeared suddenly. She had been unable to pinpoint it, and it  frustrated her to no end. The Senshi weren't scheduled to awaken for some time  yet in this universe, not that she realized that it was different from the  others. Beryl shouldn't awaken for many years either, but this seemed even  worse than her.</p><p>Whatever it was, it was crazy, violent, and chaotic. It had  to be evil; there was nothing good that combined all three of those qualities.</p><p><b>Pluto:</b> Well maybe  Los Angeles but I don't think this  counts just now.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> Not  everybody thinks the whole world revolves around <i>BOYS!</i></p><p><b>Nabiki:</b> You don't  know many nymphomaniacs, do you?</p><p><b>Ryoga</b> <i>(shouting)</i><b>:</b> <i>WHERE ON EARTH AM I NOW?</i></p><p><b>Ranma</b> <i>(in a bad alien disguise)</i><b>:</b> What makes you think this is Earth?</p><p><i>Ryoga runs off in a  panic, stops suddenly once he realizes who that was then runs back swinging his  umbrella. Ranma runs off in the other direction with Ryoga yelling obscenities  at him.</i></p><p><i>Akane and Ranma are in  the tea room of the Tendo home going over their scripts. Akane is standing  while facing the camera and Ranma is sitting in a lotus position also facing  the camera. Nabiki, Kasumi, Soun and Genma-panda are sitting around the table  behind them also checking their scripts. Akane and Ranma are arguing with the  director.</i></p><p><b>Akane</b> <i>(sounding upset)</i><b>:</b> Look, are you sure about this? I mean, my character has never  used a mallet before so why should I start now?</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> She's  right you know. What will the fans say?</p><p><b>Director:</b> I don't  know why you two are arguing about this. I didn't write the script.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> But it  just seems wrong. Whenever Ranma's character pissed mine off, she would either  punch or kick him, or use a nearby blunt instrument. Why a mallet all of a  sudden?</p><p><b>Director:</b> Look,  it's for only one scene and you'll never use it again anyway.</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Fat lot <i>you</i> know. What if the fans latch onto  her using it? What if for some reason once the series is over, somebody gets it  into their head to write their own stories about us and they have Akane always  blowing her top and swinging a mallet around? She'll end up as a horrible  caricature.</p><p><b>Kasumi:</b> Exactly,  and what about me or Nabiki? I'd turn into some sort of airhead and Nabiki  would be a money-hungry ice bitch. You think we want that?</p><p><b>Soun:</b> And what  about Genma and myself? He'll end up as a lazy and brainless coward and I'll be  a fountain with legs.</p><p><b>Panda sign:</b> Let's  not forget about Tatewaki and Ryoga.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> <i>Now</i> do you see why I don't like this?  We've got to think of our careers here.</p><p><b>Director:</b> I doubt  any of that will happen. It's not like this show will live forever or anything.  Trust me on this.</p><p><b>Insertion Outtakes  Scene 4</b></p><p>"Hate boys! Hate boys! Hate boys! <i>HATE BOYS!</i>" screamed Akane as her morning tradition began.</p><p>Ranma blinked and started walking forward with his hands in  his pockets lazily. "Oh yeah," he said out loud, as if he'd just  remembered something. Akane met the hoards of boys attacking her and he  followed just behind her, stepping over fallen bodies, and ducking under the  occasional thrown ones.</p><p>Finally, they were all defeated leaving her and Ranma about  halfway to the doors of the school. The ponytailed boy was standing in the  middle of the one time crowd, and looking around idly. He didn't seem  particularly concerned with this new development. Finally, he stepped forward,  just in time to catch a flying rose from the air.</p><p>"What the?" he muttered in confusion. He turned  and handed the rose to Akane. "Here, this is probably yours."</p><p>"You there! How dare you give a rose of love to Akane  Tendo?" said a new voice from behind a nearby tree.</p><p>"What are you so worried about? It wasn't intended for  me, and she's the only other person standing right now. At least, I hope it  wasn't for me," said Ranma calmly as he turned to face the boy who had  stepped from behind the trunk.</p><p><b>Kuno:</b> Well I do  find you attractive and I am single at the moment. Would you like to go out  sometime?</p><p><b>Director:</b>  Tatewaki, this is not the time to hit on guys. Let alone the main character.</p><p><b>Kuno</b> <i>(sighing)</i><b>:</b> Fine, whatever.</p><p><b>Insertion Outtakes  Scene 5</b></p><p>Kuno was still just behind them, waving the bokuten around  angrily. "Hold still knave! Receive your punishment!"</p><p>Ranma stopped cold and turned to face the boy.  "But...wouldn't that be stupid?"</p><p>"It is fitting that you do so to not exert me. After  all, it is inevitable that I will be victorious!" said Kuno as he stood  proudly and puffed out his chest.</p><p>"Not really, I beat you earlier pretty easy,"  continued Ranma as he looked thoughtful for a moment.</p><p>"I do not admit defeat!" snapped Kuno as he glared  at the boy.</p><p>"That doesn't change the fact that you were  beaten," pointed out Ranma. "Whether you admit it or not is  irrelevant."</p><p><b>Kuno:</b> Oh, you've  got a point there.</p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(sounding put-upon)</i><b>:</b> Tatewaki, you aren't supposed to agree with him.</p><p><b>Kuno:</b> Well excuse  <i>me</i> for thinking logically.</p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(whining)</i><b>:</b> Why me?</p><p><b>Insertion Outtakes  Scene 6</b></p><p>At that moment, Kuno rushed out the doors. "Have at  thee!"</p><p>"Okay! You asked for it!" said Ranma as cheerfully  as ever. He charged the kendoist head on.</p><p>Kuno slashed and missed as Ranma danced around his strikes,  punching and kicking at the older boy viciously. Kuno staggered back and  grunted after a dozen or so strikes hit him.</p><p>"Hey. Does that hurt?" said Ranma as he hopped up  and down unharmed nearby.</p><p>"Yes!" snapped Kuno irritably as he rubbed his  jaw.</p><p>"Okay, I just wanted to make sure you knew you were  being defeated," said Ranma with a merry looking grin.</p><p>"I do not admit defeat!" snapped Kuno.</p><p>"I thought we went over this earlier," muttered  Ranma in mock confusion as he avoided more strikes from the kendoist.</p><p>"You cannot defeat me!" said Kuno as his bokuten  suddenly became a blur of motion in front of him.</p><p>"Sure I can!" said Ranma as he jumped up and back  from the strikes. The blows shredded his clothes a little, but did no real  damage. Behind him, a statue crumbled to dust.</p><p>Kuno finally faltered in his attack, and Ranma winked at  him. Then, the ponytailed boy rushed forward, slamming his fist into his gut.  "The mighty Blue Thunder has never felt defeat!" roared the kendoist  as he pulled back and prepared to strike again.</p><p>"Really? Well," elbow, "this," punch,  "is," kick, "what," uppercut, "defeat," knee,  "feels," bitch slap, "like."</p><p>Kuno fell to his knees, leaning against his bokuten. "I  fight on!"</p><p>Ranma punched him dead in the face, sending him sprawling  across the ground on his back. He was still awake, but could obviously not  move. "So now you know," said the boy cheerfully as he looked down at  his fallen opponent.</p><p>"I feel nothing!" announced Kuno.</p><p>"That's because your nerves are in shock,"  commented Ranma lazily as he walked back towards the school. The crowd that had  followed them parted in his wake. "It'll hurt later." As Ranma  wandered off, Kuno was heard to say, "They don't pay me enough for this  aggravation."</p><p><b>Insertion Outtakes  Scene 7</b></p><p>Tatewaki Kuno sat in his room, deep in meditation. "I  was almost defeated this day. Thankfully, my superior skill allowed me to  escape such humiliation. Thus, I must think of a way to lay this sorcerer  low."</p><p>And he puzzled, and puzzed, till his puzzler was sore. Then  Kuno had an idea. Tatewaki Kuno, got a wonderful, awful, idea. "I know  just what to do!" Kuno laughed in his throat. "I'll make a quick  Santy Claus hat and a coat!" Kuno paused. Perhaps that would not be of  much help after all. He continued to think.</p><p><b>Kuno:</b> I got to  stop reading so much Dr. Seuss before bed.</p><p><b>Legend of Ranma  Outtakes Scene 1</b></p><p>In a place known as Mount   Phoenix, a certain godling by the  name of Saffron watched a scene unfold in the waters of a mystic well. The  images depicted a strange young man with pointed ears who was actually battling  against a huge dragon and was winning.</p><p>"Very interesting." Saffron turned to one his  underlings. "I did not think that the Amazons had anyone who had the power  to battle the dragon. Apparently, even the powers of the Musk Dynasty were not  enough to bend those Amazons to my will. Are you certain that no one had seen  this man before?"</p><p>"No my lord. We are not certain if this stranger is an  ally of the Amazons or a stranger."</p><p>"I sense a great power within him. Something that I had  never sensed before! A source of power that is... not of this world! I would  have this power!"</p><p><b>Underling:</b> Don't  you think that was a little too much like Kuno sir?</p><p><b>Saffron:</b> Hey, I'm  just following the script.</p><p><b>Soul's Destiny,  Blood's Inheritance Outtakes Scene 1</b></p><p>Walking through the sector of the silver palace which he was  allowed, Ranma made his way to the gardens. Gracefully leaping into the lowest  branch of a tree, he pulled out his flute and started to play. In the middle of  his song a bright flash of light shone a few yards away. When the light  disappeared, a girl, possibly his own age, was seen to fall to the ground with  grave wounds decorating her body.</p><p>Quickly jumping down to help her, Ranma saw her try to get  up again. "Shhhh. Stay down, you'll only hurt yourself worse."</p><p>Looking up at him, she managed out a few words between  gasps, "I n... need t.. to. see Q- Queen Ser.. Serenity. P.. please. It's  im... portant. I…if I don't ge…get this p…pizza to her in th…thirty minutes or  l…less, it's coming out of my p…paycheck."</p><p><i>Ranma fell down  laughing at that.</i></p><p><b>Soul's Destiny,  Blood's Inheritance Outtakes Scene 2</b></p><p>On the train, Ranma and Tenchi got acquainted with one  another, as they would be roommates on this mission to get better. Ranma was  glad he had his wallet and credit cards with him, as Nabiki was sure to go  through his stuff. Ranma and Tenchi were quick to share tales of their lives.  They shared the other's pain when it came to women troubles and laughter when  it came to the oddest memories. Tenchi was a little surprised to hear about the  curse, yet was not disgusted and did not tease Ranma about it, for which Ranma  was glad.</p><p>The fast friends soon found themselves at their stop and  quickly found their way to the resort, each helping the other when it looked  like their wounds were getting the better of them.</p><p>Walking to the front desk, Tenchi and Ranma were intercepted  by a girl with the oddest hairstyle running up to them. "Hi! I recognize  you! You were the guy who saved my life at the bank robbery two months ago! My  name's Usagi. It must be karma that I saw you today, and here of all places!  What's your name? Are you staying here too? You wanna go somewhere and make  out? I think you're cute. Wanna be my boyfriend?"</p><p><b>Director:</b> Usagi,  you're not supposed to be so forward with Ranma. I don't <i>care</i> if the two of you are married; this isn't a Ranma and Usagi  match-up story.</p><p><b>Usagi</b> <i>(sounding dejected)</i><b>:</b> Oh crud.</p><p><b>Soul's Destiny,  Blood's Inheritance Outtakes Scene 3</b></p><p>Ranma was about to ask the girl how she had been over the  past two months when he was interrupted. "Gee odango-atama," came a  male voice, "what'd you do? Run into one of the poor customers like a  freight train like you always do?"</p><p>Usagi's face turned a deep red as Ranma raised an eyebrow.  "Odango-atama?" Ranma asked, "You really shouldn't be interrupting  other people's conversations with insults like that. That one was really poor.  Not to mention you directing it at a lovely girl here who doesn't deserve such  a comment from what I've seen."</p><p>Usagi blushed, and her smile returned. "Thanks  Ranma!" she said hugging him. Then sticking her tongue out at the man  behind her and rubbing up against Ranma she replied, "What are YOU doing  here Mamoron?"</p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(sighing)</i><b>:</b> Usagi, <i>please</i> don't  adlib so much. And tone down the public display of affection please.</p><p><b>Usagi</b> <i>(blushing)</i><b>:</b> <i>Oops,</i> sorry.</p><p><b>Soul's Destiny,  Blood's Inheritance Outtakes Scene 4</b></p><p>Unlocking the room, Tenchi allowed them all in, and set his  stuff down. After Mamoru dropped his luggage, Ranma went in and got out the  pain medication and the bandages he would need. Taking off his shirt, Ranma  heard the girls gasp, and shook his head. 'They act like they've never seen a  guy half naked before. I haven't even shown them the wound yet.'</p><p>To his surprise, Ami came over and helped him get the  dressing off. "Here, I'll help you with that. Raye? Would you get me some  hot water from the bathroom? Usagi, get him a new shirt and put this one to  soak in the sink."</p><p>Both girls went to do what they were told, while the  black-haired miko was grumbling under her breath. "This isn't based on the  North American dub for crying out loud. Can't she get my name right? Jeez."</p><p><b>Soul's Destiny,  Blood's Inheritance Outtakes Scene 5</b></p><p>Suddenly, a group of people from the deeper end started to  scream and started to paddle out of the water. Something like a dragon made of  water rose out of a wave and collapsed, while launching some sort of water like  breath at the people. Hikari grabbed the twins and started to high tail it out of  the pool, while the rest started swimming to shore also, the life guard  frantically blowing his whistle. One girl however, seemed stunned as she  watched the thing rise out of the water and return. Ranma started to make his  way towards her when she was pulled under, and he heard a watery voice say,  "Your energy is mine, girl of magic."</p><p>Ranma plowed under to see energy flowing from her into a  specific spot in the water as she drowned. Focusing a chi attack, Ranma  launched it at the energy ball, dissipating it and making whatever it was lose  its hold on the girl. Grabbing her, Ranma started making strong strokes to  shore, and quickly got to where the water was knee deep. A young man his age  came and grabbed the girl as she was coughing up water, calling her name.</p><p>"Are you her brother?" Ranma asked.</p><p>The guy nodded and held out his hand, "Toya and this is  my little sister, Sakura."</p><p>"Ranma," he said as he turned and muttered, "There's  something in the water that's trying to drag people down."</p><p>Toya looked at Ranma and then at the water. "Thanks for  saving her," he said, walking to shore. Ranma just nodded and turned  himself. Just as he was about to take a step, he heard Sakura complain, "I  agreed to a bit part and <i>this</i> is what  happens? I need to fire my agent."</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Okay, by a show of hands, who here knows that none of these  characters belong to me? All of you do. Good. If this installment isn't as  funny as the first two, I apologize. I've been sweating to death here lately  since my apartment has no A.C. and I've been in a bit of a mood as well. First  off, let me mention that all the Sailor Ranko fics I used are from the mind of  burgerbill, 'Fist of the Pikachu' and 'Legend of Ranma' came from Hung Nguyen, you  can blame Carrotglace for 'Insertion,' I know I do [heh] just kidding, and the  lovely and talented kokatsu na tenshi brought 'Soul's Destiny, Blood's  Inheritance' to the fic table. I wish I could have done better than I did  though concerning the bloopers. At least some of my ideas were in here.</p><p>I of course welcome reviews and constructive criticism. If  anyone has any ideas for bloopers, just email me. As always, remember my motto.  "My fic, my rules." See you in the funny papers.</p>
