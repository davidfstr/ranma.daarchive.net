</div><p>Scenes from Nerima 5</p><p>The DigiSim Files</p><p><b><i>Well, here we go again. To think that I would be lucky enough to find  so many bloopers, outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage is just amazing. I  figure that I should spread it out since there is so much. I'm also including  some material from my first fic interspersed throughout this offering. I'd like  to thank Dkun for starting all this and Gregg Sharp and Stephen Schlueter for  continuing it. This continues to show that even anime actors and actresses are  still human, well sort of. Here we go folks.</i></b></p><p><i>A typical scene in the  Tendo home. The Tendos and Genma-panda are seated around the table in the tea  room, eating dinner. P-chan comes in from the left-hand side of the screen,  squealing his head off. Akane turns around and pork butt leaps into her arms.</i></p><p><b>Akane</b> <i>(sounding worried)</i><b>:</b> P-chan, what's wrong baby?</p><p><b>P-chan</b> <i>(opening his mouth)</i><b>:</b> <i>BRAAAAAAPPPPP!</i></p><p><i>Everybody at the table  laughs.</i></p><p><b>Nabiki</b> <i>(while laughing)</i><b>:</b> Jeez Ryoga, what did you have for lunch? You should really lay  off the spicy food.</p><p><i>P-chan blushes in  embarrassment.</i></p><p><i>The same scene as  before. P-chan enters squealing and leaps into Akane's arms.</i></p><p><b>Akane</b> <i>(sounding worried)</i><b>:</b> P-chan, what's wrong baby?</p><p><i>Ranma enters from the  left side of the screen on tiptoe. He is wearing a khaki hunting jacket, a tall  khaki hunter's cap, heavy boots and carrying a single-barreled shotgun. The  shotgun is obviously made of rubber as the barrel droops slightly and bounces  with each step. Ranma is clutching it firmly as if it were real. He then turns  to the camera.</i></p><p><b>Ranma</b> <i>(with a speech impediment)</i><b>:</b> Shhhh, be vewwy vewwy qwiet. <i>I'm</i> hunting P-chan. <i>Ahuhuhuhuhuhu.</i></p><p><i>Everyone falls down  laughing at this, even the director.</i></p><p><b>The Truth Revealed  Outtakes Scene 1</b></p><p>Over at the closed but not empty Nekohanten, Hikaru  Gosunkugi was inside, sitting at a table slurping down a bowl of ramen.  Shampoo was under the table, slurping  something else. Suddenly, there was a sound of something hitting the underside  of the table hard and very obvious as well as <i>loud</i> swearing in Mandarin.</p><p><b>Hikaru and Director:</b>  Shampoo, are you okay?</p><p><b>Shampoo</b> <i>(sounding agitated)</i><b>:</b> <i>Hell no!</i> I banged my  head. I guess that'll teach me to not get so excited the next time.</p><p><b>Hikaru:</b> I kind of  liked what you were doing honey.</p><p><b>Shampoo:</b> I meant  while under a table love. Could someone get me some aspirin and an ice pack?</p><p><b>The Truth Revealed  Outtakes Scene 2</b></p><p>Kasumi was in the laundry room, leaning against the running  dryer and thinking back to her first time with Ranma, or at least the event  that lead to it. The alarm for the dryer goes off right then with a loud  buzzing, startling Kasumi. Laughter can be heard off-stage.</p><p><b>Kasumi</b> <i>(sounding pissed)</i><b>:</b> Oh <i>shut up</i> Akane!</p><p><b>The Truth Revealed  Outtakes Scene 3</b></p><p>"Mimi, what are you doing?" Turning her head to look at who  came in, she saw it was her savior Hikaru. Giving out a mew of query and then  turning back to her picture, Gos realized correctly that she was curious. "I  see you've found the picture of my lavender haired goddess of desire. Damn, I  gotta stop hanging around Kuno." Hikaru was slightly startled when the kitten  looked on him with what seemed to be amusement. Deciding to fill her in, he  picked Mimi up in one hand, the picture in the other and sat down on his bed.  Hikaru started to unzip his fly when the director started to yell at him.</p><p><b>Director:</b> Hikaru,  stop right now! This isn't a lemon! Besides, I doubt that will fit in her.</p><p><b>Hikaru:</b> Sure it  will. We've done it before while Shampoo was a cat. Where do you think the  inspiration for <i>'Gonna Feel It in the  Morning'</i> came from?</p><p><i>Off stage, there are  the sounds of people being violently ill, except for Ranma saying Hikaru wasn't  the first one to do that with Shampoo that way. Hikaru and Shampoo-neko just  look at each other with a</i> 'What's their problem?' <i>look on their faces.</i></p><p><i>The view is of a  hallway obviously being shot with a camcorder. It's a little shaky because the  camera operator is walking down the hall. There are doors all on the left-side  wall. On each door is a star with a cast members name on it. Ranma is at it  again.</i></p><p><i>The camera view stops  at an open door where the name</i> 'Shampoo' <i>is on the star. Looking inside shows a green-haired girl in a tiger  print two-piece bikini standing in front of the dressing table and studying her  reflection. The girl, who seems to be Lum, looks odd. Zooming in on her face  shows that her ears aren't pointed and she is missing her horns. The view zooms  out to show more of Lum again. Seeming to respond to some sort of noise, she  turns to the camera and screams in fright.</i></p><p><b>Lum</b> <i>(obviously angry)</i><b>:</b> <i>RANMA</i>, what are you <i>DOING?</i></p><p><b>Ranma</b> <i>(heard off-camera)</i><b>:</b> Shampoo, since when are you an otaku?</p><p><b>Shampoo:</b> Since <i>never</i> you twit. What gave you that idea?</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> That  outfit of yours for one. What's the deal?</p><p><b>Shampoo</b> <i>(sighing in resignation)</i><b>:</b> I guess the secret's out. I <i>am</i> Lum. Or at least, I took over the  role for my twin sister ever since she had that accident during her skiing trip  that got both her legs broken. Believe it or not, she is kind of glad I took  over. And it gets me two paychecks.</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> I guess <i>that</i> explains how you can afford that  Lamborghini out in the parking lot.</p><p><b>The Truth Revealed  Outtakes Scene 4</b></p><p>Late that night, Gos was relaxing in the furo when the door  opened. Looking up, he saw it was Mimi. "Mimi, what are you doing in here?"  Without giving him time to try to get her to leave, Shampoo leapt into the  furo. Or at least she tried to. A puddle of water caused Shampoo to slip and  slide into the furo. Breaking through the surface, Shampoo starts coughing and  is grasping her head.</p><p><b>Director:</b>  Shampoo, you all right? Do you need to see the studio doctor?</p><p><b>Shampoo:</b> No, I'll  be fine. Just smacked my head on the bottom of the furo is all. I seem to get  into more accidents lately. And now I need <i>more</i>  aspirin.</p><p><b>The Truth Revealed  Outtakes Scene 5</b></p><p>Over at the Kuno compound, also lovingly dubbed by the  locals as <i>Maniac Mansion</i>, Tatewaki  Kuno was playing with his sword. He was also practicing with his bokken.  Hearing footsteps behind him, he whirled around in what he thought of as a  dramatic display that just made him dizzy and a little nauseous. His vision a  little blurred thanks to his dizziness, Tatewaki started to spew his usual  drivel. "Hold base commoner, know thee now that you have trespassed into the  home of the noble Clan Kuno!" You could just hear the capitals. "You would do  well to retreat like the lowly cur you obviously are lest thou taste of my  mighty blade!" Insert impressive yet pointless lightning strike here. "Very  well, I have given fair warning! Now prepare to be brought low by my…Oh, Ryoga  it's you. I'm sorry; my sight was a little blurry from spinning around so fast.  How have you been?" Vision clearing, Tatewaki could clearly see it was indeed  Ryoga Hibiki, his only true friend.</p><p>"Hey Tate-chan, I've missed you. My but you do look handsome  today. Gimme some sugar." With a naughty grin revealing one fang, pig-boy, I  mean Ryoga, took the kendoist into his arms and they shared a very deep soul  kiss while grasping and massaging each others asses and grinding their crotches  together. Pretty soon, their kissing started to get more and more heated as  their hands started to roam over each other's bodies.</p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(sounding pissed)</i><b>:</b> <i>GET A ROOM!</i></p><p><i>While trapped in the  clutches of the Golden Pair performing the Goodbye Whirl, Ranma and Akane are  arguing. Akane keeps trying to get Ranma to let her go and Ranma keeps trying  to convince her she's being stupid about it. All of a sudden, </i><i>Azusa</i><i> gets dizzy and ends up sending Ranma and  Akane flying towards the far wall. Ranma slams into it first and Akane slams  into him. They both collapse to the ice, knocked unconscious by the collision.  Almost immediately, snickers are heard coming from the audience, which grow in  volume to full-blown laughter. Even though it's supposed to be a dramatic  scene, the director joins in on the hilarity. Akane lifts her head, wondering  why everybody is laughing and sees the reason right away. She can't help but  laugh too.</i></p><p><b>Ranma</b> <i>(waking up)</i><b>:</b> What's so damn funny?</p><p><b>Akane</b> <i>(having trouble talking)</i><b>:</b> Y-y-you're <i>Bwahahahaha! Hee-hee-hee!</i> Oh man, this is <i>classic!</i></p><p><i>Azusa</i><i> skates over and drops something on Ranma's  chest. It's his pants.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Oh, no  wonder my ass was so cold.</p><p><i>Everybody ends up  laughing harder at this statement, with Ranma joining in.</i></p><p><b>Mousse:</b> <i>RANMA, PREPARE TO DIET!</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Are you  calling me <i>fat</i>, duck-boy?</p><p><b>Director:</b> Try  again.</p><p><b>Mousse:</b> <i>RANMA, PREPARE TO FLY!</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Do I need  a boarding pass?</p><p><b>Director:</b> Again  please.</p><p><b>Mousse:</b> <i>RANMA, PREPARE TO CRY!</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> How, are  you going to show me your paycheck?</p><p><b>Director:</b> <i>Oy Vey.</i></p><p><b>Furo Scene Again Take  3</b></p><p><i>Ranma-chan is  grumbling to herself about</i> 'uncute tomboys' <i>while stripping. She heads to the door to go into the main part of the  furoba. Akane opens the door, also nude and sees Ranma-chan. Akane leaps  forward, wrapping her arms around Ranma-chan's back and her legs around her  waist while rubbing her face into Ranma-chan's cleavage.</i></p><p><b>Akane</b> <i>(shouting but a little muffled)</i><b>:</b> <i>SWEETO!  COME TO MAMA!</i></p><p><b>Ranma-chan:</b> Jeez,  and everybody calls <i>me</i> a pervert.</p><p><i>Everybody cracks up,  even the director.</i></p><p><b>Furo Scene Again Take  4</b></p><p><i>Ranma-chan is  grumbling to herself about</i> 'uncute tomboys' <i>while stripping. She heads to the door to go into the main part of the  furoba. Akane opens the door, also nude and sees Ranma-chan. She swings her  hand back to slap Ranma and accidentally hits the wall a little too hard on the  backswing.</i></p><p><b>Akane</b> <i>(in pain)</i><b>:</b> <i>EEEYYOOOWWWWWCCCCHHHHH!</i></p><p><b>Ranma-chan:</b> Can  somebody bring a First-Aid kit?</p><p><b>Director</b> <i>(sighs)</i><b>:</b> I can just see the headlines now. <i>'New Series Cancelled Due To Medical Mishaps.'</i> We are <i>so</i> screwed if this keeps up.</p><p><i>Ranma and Akane are  sitting on the porch that looks out on the backyard of the Tendo home. The  camera is somewhat behind them showing the hallway.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> You know  Akane, I've been wondering.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> What about  Ranma?</p><p><i>Genma-panda enters  from the left side of the screen on a unicycle while juggling three  rainbow-colored balls. He has a miniature sign strapped to his head that reads</i>  'Will do tricks for bamboo.' <i>He cycles  off to the right while still juggling.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> What is it  about Nerima that makes things so <i>strange</i>?</p><p><b>Akane:</b> <i>Strange</i>? What do you mean by <i>strange</i>?</p><p><i>Soun enters from the  right in a bright pink ballet outfit, complete with tutu. He toe steps with his  arms raised to the middle of the screen, does two pirouettes then leaps off to  the left. The sound of breaking wood, shattering glass and a cat screeching is  heard off-camera.</i></p><p><b>Akane:</b> Why did  you shudder just now?</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> I don't  know. Just must have been a chill breeze I guess.</p><p><i>Kasumi enters from the  left dressed like she would fit in at Sturgis. She is wearing scuffed bikers'  boots, blue jeans, black leather chaps, a black leather sleeveless vest and a  black T-shirt that says</i> 'Don't Piss Me Off' <i>in big red letters on it. She is scratching her ass with her right  hand, trying to dislodge her underwear. She stops in the middle of the screen  with a bewildered expression on her face while scratching her head with the  same hand she was using to get rid of her wedgie. She shrugs and walks off to  the right.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> What was I  saying?</p><p><b>Akane:</b> Something  about Nerima being strange.</p><p><i>Mousse enters from the  right, sits down in the middle of the screen, pulls out a miniature piano from  his robes, sets it down on the floor and starts to play a slightly upbeat tune.  P-chan enters from the left, climbs up on the piano and starts to dance on it.  Mousse glares at P-chan and suddenly yanks the piano out from under him which  sends The Other White Meat tumbling back the way he came. Mousse stands up,  sticks his piano under his arm and sulks off to the left while muttering under  his breath about pork ramen.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Oh yeah, <i>now</i> I remember.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> So what  exactly was it that you meant?</p><p><i>Nabiki enters from the  left backwards. She is dressed like Luke Skywalker from the first</i> 'Star  Wars' <i>movie. She is swinging a lightsaber  around, parrying the strikes of someone off-screen. As she backs up more,  Nodoka, dressed like Obi-Wan Kenobi, enters and continues to spar with Nabiki.  She parries a thrust from Nabiki which sends the shorthaired sexy  Jedi-in-training's blade towards Ranma and Akane's necks.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Hey Akane,  check <i>this</i> out.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> What <i>is</i> that?</p><p><i>The blade passes over  the both of them as they bend over at the waist to peer at something on the  ground. Nabiki regains control of her lightsaber while Nodoka continues her  advance. They both exit to the right, parrying each others moves. Luckily for  Nabiki, she doesn't fall down even if she is still going backwards.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Never  mind, I thought it was a diamond or something. Guess I was wrong.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> Too bad it  wasn't. It would help with the bills.</p><p><i>Genma-panda enters  from the right, still on the unicycle and still juggling. The sign on his head  now reads</i> 'I'm available for weddings, children's parties and Bar Mitzvahs.  Contact G. Saotome at the Tendo Dojo for information.' <i>He cycles off to the left.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Anyway,  like I was saying. Take Kuno for instance. He made that stupid speech and then  almost all the guys at the school tried to beat you up for a date. I doubt <i>that's</i> normal.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> Please, <i>don't</i> remind me.</p><p><i>Miss Hinako, in her  child form, walks in from the left and stands in the middle of the screen,  facing the camera and smiling while wearing a barely-there red two-piece string  bikini. She starts doing muscleman poses. While doing</i> 'The Crab', <i>the strings of her bikini snap and the suit  drops to the floor. She shrieks in surprise and runs off to the right. The  speed of her departure causes a vacuum effect which makes her bikini quickly  scuttle along the floor after her.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Then there  is his squirrel's picnic of a sister. What kind of person keeps an alligator  for a pet anyway?</p><p><b>Akane:</b> Squirrel's  picnic?</p><p><i>Nabiki and Nodoka  enter again. They are still sparring with lightsabers but Nabiki is now dressed  as Luke from</i> 'The Empire Strikes Back', <i>in  the flight suit he wore. Nodoka is dressed as Darth Vader but without the  helmet. They keep moving to the left and exit.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> I mean  she's nuts.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> <i>Oh.</i></p><p><i>Kuno strolls in from  the left while reading a book entitled</i> 'How to Win Friends and Influence  People.' <i>As he exits to the right, if  anyone had been paying attention they would have commented how well the Sailor  Mars costume he's wearing shows off his legs.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> I could go  on all day about the strange things here in Nerima but there's one thing I like  about living here at the dojo.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> What's  that?</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Everyone <i>here</i> is somewhat normal. Shall we go?</p><p><b>Akane:</b> Sure.</p><p><i>As they stand, it's  revealed that Ranma and Akane are wearing bunny-girl outfits. Even though Ranma  is a guy just then doesn't bother him.</i></p><p><b>Ranma:</b> It's a  good thing we found those jobs to attract customers to that new Playboy Club  restaurant.</p><p><b>Akane:</b> I'm  surprised you bring in more customers than I do while you're a guy.</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Like I  told you Akane. Nerima is strange.</p><p><i>She finally agrees  with him as they exit to the left and the scene fades to black.</i></p><p><b>Mousse:</b> <i>RANMA, PREPARE TO</i> oh the hell with it. I  give up.</p><p><b>Ranma:</b> Took you  long enough.</p><p><b>Director:</b> I need  a drink.</p><p><b>Kuno:</b> Akane  Tendo, I would mate with you!</p><p><b>Akane:</b> Sorry  buddy, you're not my type.</p><p><i>The director starts to  cry.</i></p><p><i>Ranma and Ryoga are at  the bottom of a crater that was created by Ryoga at Furinkan. Ryoga has just  let off a huge Shi Shi Hokodan and Ranma tries to distract him.</i></p><p><b>Ranma</b> <i>(pointing and looking to his right)</i><b>:</b> Look, I can see Akane's panties!</p><p><i>Ryoga turns to look.</i></p><p><b>Akane</b> <i>(yelling)</i><b>:</b> Ranma you idiot! I'm not <i>wearing</i>  any panties! <i>Oops.</i></p><p><i>Everybody facefaults  at this announcement.</i></p><p><b>The Truth Revealed  Outtakes Scene 6</b></p><p>"I remember thinking to myself, 'What would a beautiful and  intelligent girl like her ever see in a loser like me?'" Shampoo, moved by the  comment, put her delicate paw on the hand holding her photo and mewed in  support. Looking down, Gos smiled gratefully. "Thanks Mimi. You always know how  to cheer me up." Shampoo mewed back a feline 'You're Welcome' and batted at the  picture. Doing so made her lose her balance, fall off his lap and prove that cats  don't always land on their feet. She then gave out a pitiful mew that  translated to <i>'Someone up there must hate  me.'</i></p><p><b>The Truth Revealed Outtakes Scene 7</b></p><p>Taking a sip of his now cold tea,  Tofu let what he said sink in. Finally Nabiki asked, "So who was it you were in  love with? Did you figure that out?" Looking at her directly in the eyes he  said, "It was you and Akane." Everyone else gasped at that. Then Akane started  to cough and Genma started to pound on her back.</p><p><b>Akane</b> <i>(clearing her throat)</i><b>:</b> I'm fine, I'm fine. Tea just went  down the wrong way is all.</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>I think this is enough for now. I  still don't own any of the characters used here, just the ideas. If I did, the  royalties alone would probably get me that private island I've always wanted.  Anyway, I was hoping that people would email me with blooper ideas but nobody  did. Drag. Oh well. Reviews are always appreciated, for all my fics that is.  I'm still working on some and I just might be coming out with an extra chapter  or two of 'A Different Kind of Truth.' Don't hold your breath though. My muse  sometimes hates me. For those of you that don't know what 'The Crab' pose is,  just think of what a normal crab looks like. Either that or think of the pose  that Hulk Hogan sometimes does. That is 'The Crab'. As always, don't forget my  motto, "My fic, my rules." See you in the funny papers.</p>
