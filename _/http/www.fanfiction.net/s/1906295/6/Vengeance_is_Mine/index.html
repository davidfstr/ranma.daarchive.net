</div><p>Ranma Saotome didn't have the practice at crying that Soun Tendo did, his tears ended soon enough. His turbulent thoughts, continually reagitated by Miss Hinako's scream echoing in his ears, took much longer to settle down. The sun had passed the midway point in it's journey from horizon to horizon before Ranma could think coherently, if not completely rationally.<p>"I can't stay here forever," Ranma said aloud, his first words in hours. "Somebody'll come lookin' for me." He made no effort to move or hide... or be found.<p>Now that the barrier had finally cracked, Ranma was able to think about what had happened, not just react to it. 'What the hell did I <i>do</i> back there?' he asked himself. According to Miss Hinako, and his own personal experience, his teacher possessed unlimited ability to drain auras. The only effect sucking his excess aura should have had was that she'd remain in adult form longer.<p>Which clearly had not happened.<p>If it wasn't the sheer amount of aura she drained, it would have to be what was in it. His anger. His rage. His hatred. His... shame. Ranma had encapsulated his negative emotions and forcibly crammed them all into his subconscious mind. Thus displaced, his subconscious had leaked into his perceptions of reality.<p>His teacher had actually done Ranma a great favor by draining some of his aura. It was analogous to reducing dangerously high boiler pressure by cracking a relief valve. The mental pressure caused by his excessive emotions were reduced enough that he could function normally. Assuming he, or someone else, didn't aggravate his condition.<p>Unfortunately, Ranma understood almost none of this. He got as far as the theory that his emotional state had something to do with his teacher's reaction when he was finally found.<p>"There you are, I had hoped to find you first," said the last person on the planet that he wanted to see at that moment. "Everyone has been searching for you," she continued.<p>"Everyone?" Ranma retorted.<p>"Very well, not quite everyone," Miss Hinako admitted. "Akane went home to wait for you there. Also, we didn't begin looking until school was over for the day." She'd changed clothes from when he'd seen her last. Which was understandable considering the damage her previous outfit had taken. Unlike the too tight or too loose clothes she normally wore to fit both her forms, the casual outfit his teacher now had on was clearly meant strictly for an adult Hinako Ninomiya. Ranma stared curiously as his teacher sat down with her legs tucked beneath her.<p>"Oh, you noticed," Hinako said offhandedly with a wave at herself. "I bought this after I met your fiancee's father. On the off chance that I would ever have a use for it."<p>A worry line creased Ranma's forehead. "Are ya all right?"<p>"Mr. Saotome, I can honestly answer that question by saying 'I don't know.' All I do know is that my life has changed, whether I wanted it to or not, and that I will have to live with that change."<p>Ranma beheld at with his teacher with carefully concealed awe. She had nailed his own situation perfectly without even realizing it.<p>Hinako continued, "I've already noticed some... differences in the way I think. When I was in child form, I became very childish. Going through puberty on fast-forward and back ten times a day didn't help either. Thanks to you, or perhaps curses to you, those things are past. I'll have to be an adult all the time. I'll have to learn new ways to teach, to discipline delinquents, to deal with others."<p>Ranma's mind raced to find ways to adapt what his teacher said to his own situation.<p>"Who knows, I might even learn how to drive now that my feet will always reach the pedals." She rolled her eyes in pleased contemplation. "... definitely need to buy a new wardrobe."<p>Before she drifted further off topic, Ranma formally bowed and apologized. "I am very sorry Miss Hinako."<p>"As well you should be Mr. Saotome," she replied solemnly. "It was a very painful event. You've completely altered my life and forced upon me a most difficult task that I never asked for. The fact that it may turn out to be my greatest opportunity is moot."<p>Ranma nodded in acknowledgement.<p>"But what's done... is done. I know in my soul that it cannot be undone. We will both have to live with that fact."<p>"Yes, we will," Ranma admitted. "But I'm still sorry."<p>Hinako nodded in agreement and stood up. "Before I forget, your English assignment is to read chapter 4 of the current workbook and answer the questions at the end in English."<p>Ranma rummaged around in the bookbag he'd carried with him in his flight from the school. He pulled out the English homework he'd meant to turn in after homeroom and held it out. "These were for today. Sorry they're late."<p>Miss Hinako smiled and took the papers without comment before leaving.<p>Soon after, a figure melted out of the shadows of the bridge. Dressed in full ninja regalia, Konatsu Kanzen allowed himself to be sensed, then seen, by Ranma Saotome.<p>Two minutes later, Ranma finally asked, "Well?"<p>"Well what?"<p>"Well are ya gonna say sumthin', or are we gonna fight?"<p>"Which would you prefer?"<p>"I'd prefer ya said sumthin'. There's only one guy I wanna beat up right now and you ain't him."<p>"Good choice," the male, yet raised as female, former kunoichi said as he plopped down next to Ranma.<p>"Shoot," Ranma said simply.<p>"It involves Ukyo-sama." With Konatsu, that was pretty much a given. Ranma certainly felt no surprise.<p>"Ya know, if you'd've found me a couple of hours ago, I'd've told ya I didn't have anything to say to Ukyo."<p>Konatsu snorted in amusement. "I found you three hours ago and have been leading people away from you ever since."<p>"Why?" Not that he was ungrateful.<p>"You weren't ready," the ninja said flatly. "But from your comment, I'm guessing you have something to say now?"<p>"Tell her I'm still mad about what she did at the wedding."<p>"I tried to talk her out of it," Konatsu quickly stated.<p>"I'm sure ya did. But tell her... Tell her I got some stuff ta take care of first, but after that, if she wants, we can... do sumthin'."<p>"Something?"<p>"I don't know how else ta put it cause I don't know how I feel about Ukyo now. All I know is I ain't got any friends ta spare and I don't wanna lose another one."<p>"You don't call her 'Ucchan' anymore," Konatsu observed.<p>"I don't call her my 'cute fiancee' anymore either. 'Ucchan' was my friend. 'Ukyo' helped wreck my folks' house and then bombed my wedding. It's like she's a whole different person now."<p>"She was scared and desperate Ranma," Konatsu explained. Desperation did strange things to the woman he loved as it did to many people. "Ukyo-sama loves you and thought you were making a terrible mistake."<p>Harsh emotion crept into Ranma's voice. "It wasn't a mistake. It was my choice. Not hers. Ya know, that's what pisses me off most about the whole damn disaster. Nobody thinks I can make a decision on my own. Everybody just decides what's best for me and if they feel like it, maybe they'll tell me. But that just doesn't work 'cause no matter what I do, somebody gets hurt.<p>"Look, I'm sorry I can't love Ukyo the way she loves me, or thinks she does. But for me, it'd be like marrying my sister," Ranma said before hastily adding, "If I had one."<p>"I will give Ukyo-sama your message, but your explanation must be tendered to her in person," Konatsu stated as he bowed and stepped backwards.<p>Ranma signaled agreement as the ninja melted into the shadows leaving him alone once more.<p>The two conversations did Ranma a world of good. He'd been drawn out of a morass of doubt and self pity. He'd vented a small part of the anger that remained within him without hurting anyone. But the progress thus made left him with a choice. Returning to the Tendo dojo would lead to a confrontation with Akane. There was no way of knowing in advance whether or not she'd be rational. Experience said no, the fact that Miss Hinako seemed all right pointed toward yes. But not far enough towards yes that he wanted to risk his fiancee's temper.<p>The other option was to go do what he'd originally intended for the afternoon. Which was to talk to his parents, no matter how painful the results would be. He'd put it off once, if he kept putting it off, it would mean that he was more like his father than he wanted to admit.<p>Which made the choice simple. After taking a brief glance to make sure the coast was clear, Ranma set off for Adachi and his parent's newly rebuilt home.<p>-<p>Unlike in his nightmare, the appearance of the Saotome residence matched what he remembered of it. Unlike someone who was sure of his welcome and his place, Ranma knocked and waited for admission.<p>It wasn't long before Nodoka opened the door. For once, she was not carrying the Saotome clan sword. But then again, this was where she lived. As mother hugged child, Nodoka's joy in seeing her manly son was clearly evident. She said, "Ranma, I am your mother and this is your home. There is no reason for you to knock as if you were a door to door salesman."<p>Ranma was glad to hear those words as he exchanged his thin-soled shoes for 'Brave Patrick' house slippers. Then he remembered why he was there. Screwing up his courage, he said, "Thanks mom. Is Pops here? There's sumthin' I gotta to talk ya both about. It's pretty serious."<p>"Is there a problem between you and Akane?" Nodoka asked.<p>"Not... directly," Ranma stated slowly.<p>Further questions were interrupted by Genma's arrival. Within seconds, he'd drug his son outside and began sparring with an intensity Ranma hadn't seen in months. He scrambled defensively until he adjusted for his father's slight increase in speed and power.<p>Without a dunk in the koi pond to determine victory, the fight lasted longer than normal. But eventually, Genma overextended while trying to strike his evading son and wound up on the receiving end of a joint lock. Ranma pivoted and threw his father hard enough to rattle the fence around the Saotome backyard.<p>Genma quickly rolled to his feet looking none the worse for wear. "What's wrong with you boy? You getting soft?" he asked as he stalked nearer to continue.<p>"Nope," Ranma responded as he swayed away from a punch. "Trying..." Ducked another punch. "Not ta..." Jumped a sweep. "Wreck..." Spun away from a grapple. "The place," he finished while completing the spin and elbowing his father in the back just hard enough to make Genma stumble.<p>The elder Saotome wrenched himself erect and twisted to face his son. "You'll have to do better than that boy," Genma said as he faded from view.<p>At his father's use of what was supposed to be a sealed technique, Ranma began to grow angry. The harmless fun of sparring faded to the aggravation of pointless combat. A blow, seemingly from nowhere, snapped his head around. Strictly on instinct, Ranma dropped to the ground and preformed a whirling sweep that connected with nothing. Regaining his feet, he looked for any traces of Genma's presence.<p>A disembodied voice asked, "Are you sure you're not still a girl?"<p>Ranma went rigid with anger for a split second. It was long enough for Genma to slam an open handed blow into his son's ribcage. Even caught off guard, Ranma managed to ride the force of the blow to a surprising extent. Instead of being sprawled on the ground, he remained standing.<p>Had Ranma been able to use the Umi-Sen-Ken, he could have stalemated his father that way. But the excess emotions he carried would betray his presence as surely as waving a red flag. And as he had once taunted Ryu Kumon, he couldn't fight what he couldn't see.<p>Or could he?<p>Inspiration struck like lightning. Ranma released the negative emotions he'd kept bottled up for so long. A pale yellow aura exploded around him, filling the entire yard. Nodoka, who had been watching the entire fight from the rear doorway of the Saotome home, flinched away from the visible manifestation of her son's emotional state. Genma stood his ground, unconcerned with the seemingly pointless outburst. Until Ranma leapt straight at him in a flying kick.<p>Ranma still couldn't see his father. But he could feel the dead spot inside the aura he'd released. Not as reliable as eyesight, but good enough that Genma lost consciousness before he could pull something else out of his bag of dirty tricks. Afterwards, it took a distinct effort for Ranma to cram his emotions back into the part of his mind they'd been staying in.<p>A dousing with cold water didn't wake Genma, his panda form just snored louder. Hotter than necessary water sufficed to wake up and retransform Ranma's father. Who immediately wanted another crack at his son.<p>"Husband, that is quite enough," Nodoka scolded. Genma ignored the tone of voice, he'd become used to it. It was his wife's glance toward the Saotome clan honor sword that convinced him to settle down. Returning her gaze to her husband, Nodoka said, "Before your little spat, our son said that there was something important he needed to discuss with both of us."<p>As the three seated themselves at a low table, Ranma nodded in agreement. He took deep breaths to calm the Mothra sized butterflies in his stomach.<p>"Would you like some tea?" Nodoka inquired. Ranma muttered negatively and Genma shook his head 'no' in response to the same question.<p>"Well?" Genma asked gruffly. 'It can't be anything important', he thought.<p>Ranma sighed. He knew there was nothing left to do, but to do it. "I found out why my curse got locked," he began.<p>Genma began paying attention. While there were things he secretly enjoyed about his Jusenkyo curse, he had no desire to get stuck in panda form permanently. If what happened to his son ever happened to him, he wanted to know the way out.<p>"It's nuthin' that would affect you Pop," Ranma said in response to his father's apparent interest.<p>His parents waited patiently for Ranma to continue.<p>"My curse locked 'cause I got pregnant."<p>With those words, worlds shattered. Genma's expression went very carefully neutral. Nodoka's expression kept changing. From shock to disbelief. From disbelief to anger. From anger to hatred. From hatred to disappointment to disgust to resignation to even darker emotions. Eventually her expression became merely unhappy, but it was clearly just a mask.<p>"Leave," Nodoka Saotome calmly told her former son.<p>"Mom?" Ranma asked. He looked for some sign of compassion in his mother. He found nothing. Less than nothing.<p>"Never call me that again. Leave now. Were you still my son, I would have to kill you for your unmanliness."<p>"I was <i>raped </i>dammit!" Ranma shouted. He wouldn't even get the chance to explain. He'd lost before he'd started. He had been disowned as casually as a fly was swatted. Only a whim on his mother's part had prevented her from killing him.<p>"Even worse!" Nodoka shouted back. Nodoka rose, walked over to the Saotome clan sword and took it down from its support pegs. She commanded, "Husband, remove that intruder from our home." With a quick motion, the naked blade stood shining in the brightly lit room.<p>Genma stood, his face neutral, his body language broadcasting an absolute defeat. "Ranma, don't make this any worse than it is." With a gesture, he motioned Ranma towards the front door.<p>It was odd to hear his father call him by name. He couldn't recall the last time his father had called him anything other than 'boy'. It called out for a response in kind. "Genma, ya know she's gonna kill you, right?" he stated as he... staggered... toward the rest of his life.<p>Nodoka's eyes narrowed at her former child's comment. As he stood in the entryway, putting on his street shoes, he looked back one final time. Ranma's vision twitched. The Saotome home transformed into a torture chamber. Lamps became torches, wooden walls morphed into rough hewn stone. Tables changed into torture racks, chairs mutated into iron maidens. Bookshelves held thumbscrews, bamboo slivers, small knives and other less identifiable devices. Blood, old and new, was everywhere and a sharp metallic smell filled the air.<p>His father, or more accurately the man who had been his father, lay dead on the floor, decapitated. A panda's head, eyes wide with surprise behind glasses, was impaled on a spike. The woman who had given birth to him, and yet never been his mother he suddenly realized, was transformed as well.<p>Leather bondage gear replaced her normal kimono. A coiled whip hung at her left side. Amazingly, the Saotome Clan sword changed not at all and remained pointed at him. An expression of calculated cruelty marred her features. "I always knew I'd find an excuse to kill you," a voice that did and did not belong to Nodoka Saotome said.<p>Ranma suddenly saw himself in the hallucinatory scene. He was in female form, stripped to the waist with fresh whip scars covering his/her female torso. Chains bound his cursed form hand and foot. Escape seemed unlikely.<p>The apparition that was his mother swung her blade at head height. The dream Ranma ducked under the murderous stroke. A second blow was blocked with the chains in which he was bound. A thrust meant to pierce him from belly to spine was avoided with a deft twist.<p>Ranma watched his dream self avoid blow after blow from an increasingly demonic and more powerful Nodoka. At last, the dream Ranma's strategy made itself clear. Using the chains to block again, a link was finally severed. A small section of his bonds fell loose to the floor. Pulling it through the restraining loop, he gained mobility and a weapon of his own. On his first attack, he wrenched the sword free from the green skinned monster that had once been a woman. Before the creature could do anything in response, the dream Ranma took the blade he had obtained and shattered it in his/her bare hands.<p>The sun was heading toward the horzon and a brisk wind chilled Ranma's flesh as his vision finally cleared. That he was a long way from anyplace he recognized completely escaped him. His left hand covered a superficial wound to his neck and he carried the hilt of the Saotome Clan sword, with a handsbreadth of metal remaining attached to it, in his bleeding right.<p>Once he realized he was no longer dreaming, he dropped the blade's remains and stared at the blood on his hands.<p>-<p>End Part 5<p>-<p>Author's notes: For some reason, a lot of fanfic authors put the Saotome household in Azuba-Juban. I figure that's much too expensive a place for Nodoka to have lived for so many years without visible means of support. So, just to be different I've placed the Saotome residence in Adachi, which is pretty much north of downtown Tokyo.</p>
