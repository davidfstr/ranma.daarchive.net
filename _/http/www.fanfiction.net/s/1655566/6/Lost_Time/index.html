</div>Hey guys! Thanks so much for all of your comments! I'll answer them at the end of the chapter :D<p>ALSO... If anyone is interested in seeing my illustrations of this story, visit my  user page and you'll find the links :D (please, let me know what you think of both the story AND the art!)<p>-<p>Lost Time Chapter 5<p>"Aren't you worried?"<p>Ranma shrugged Akane off as they made their way through the woods. "About what?"<p>Akane grabbed his arm and stopped him in his tracks. "Haven't you seen the sky? It looks like rain."<p>"I'm trying not to think about it," he hissed back at her. "Be quiet."<p>"You haven't told Kagome and Inuyasha about your curse," she went on. "Don't you think they'll—" Just as she was about to finish her sentence, she tripped on a rock. Ranma grabbed her just before she could go tumbling to the forest floor.<p>"Jeez, Akane, you klutz! Watch your step!" He blinked at her, realizing that their faces were inches apart. Quickly, he let her go, and they went racing to catch back up with Inuyasha and Kagome. "Ah... you should really be more careful," he muttered.<p>"Where are the others?" Ranma heard Kagome ask Inuyasha when they caught up to them.<p>"Miroku took Sango back to her village. Apparently it's the anniversary of..." he trailed off. "Shippo went with them. We couldn't wait. We have no choice but to move on without them. Maybe they can catch up later."<p>Inuyasha must have been speaking of his other travel companions, Ranma assumed. He didn't want to ask. "Um," he said, poking Inuyasha in the shoulder, only to receive a fierce yellow glare. "Where exactly are we going?"<p>"To find Naraku, moron," Inuyasha huffed back at him. "If my hunch is right, we can complete the jewel by combining the other shards with the shard that hangs from your woman's neck."<p>Ranma felt his blood boil. And he had said it in front of Akane, too! "She's not—" he broke off, stopping dead in his tracks. Akane ran right into his back. They were suddenly standing in the middle of a downpour.<p>"Ranma," Akane said, pushing him behind her back when Inuyasha and Kagome turned to see what the problem was. "Hey, guys... there's something you should know."<p>"Where the hell did that moron go?" Inuyasha demanded<p>Ranma shoved Akane out of the way and stepped out from behind her. "I'm here," he said. "What Akane was trying to tell you is that—" He stopped. Inuyasha was staring at his chest. He folded his arms over it. "What exactly do you think you're looking at!"<p>"You're not him," Inuyasha pointed out. "You're... a woman."<p>Kagome hit in square in the shoulder. "Quit staring!"<p>"That's what I'm trying to tell you!" Ranma screamed. "I have this curse... I turn into... well, this when I get wet." Suddenly, he had Inuyasha circling him, sniffing the air around him. "What the hell are you doing! Get away from me!" He was about to punch the other boy in the nose, when Inuyasha straightened up and narrowed his eyes.<p>"And I thought I had problems," he said. "You're a complete freak!"<p>Ranma could feel his face getting hotter and hotter. If Inuyasha kept at it, then Ranma couldn't be held responsible for his actions. "Look who's talking, dog-boy!" he retorted, but it came out as a screech. He glared angrily at the other boy.<p>They both continued to growl at each other until the girls pushed them up the path.<p>"It would be much easier if they would just get along," Ranma heard Kagome say.<p>"They're too much alike," Akane muttered back to her.<p>The slippery terrain, the fact that he didn't sleep much the night before, and his smaller body proved to make Ranma almost as klutzy as Akane. He grabbed onto her dress twice and was slapped across the face once.<p>"What's wrong with you, Ranma?" she asked after the second time, giving him a glare. Just as she said it, her shoe slipped on a slippery patch of grass, and they both fell hard to the ground.<p>Ranma pushed a chunk of red hair from his face. "I guess I'm tired," he mumbled as he moved off of Akane. "But that fall was definitely your fault."<p>*****<p>Inuyasha stopped in his tracks. He felt his eye twitching as he listened to Ranma and Akane blame each other for why they were no longer on their feet. If Only he could have thrown the girl over his shoulder and found out a way to get the shard from her neck without having to deal with Ranma. It was then that he realized his claws were digging holes into the palms of his hands, and he spun around on the pads of his feet. "Get up," he growled at them.<p>Akane leapt to her feet, but Ranma stayed right where he was. The girl... er boy, was almost as stubborn as Inuyasha himself.<p>"Unless you want Naraku to find us before we can find him, I suggest you get off your ass and start walking before your girlfriend ends up missing."<p>Ranma looked as though smoke would start to come out of his ears as the rain pounded down on the top of his head. He gritted his teeth. "She's not my—"<p>Akane grabbed his arm and pulled him almost effortlessly. "Quit being such a jerk," she told him, "and listen to what Inuyasha says. He knows what he's talking about."<p>Inuyasha gave a nod. "Damn straight," he affirmed.<p>Kagome took his arm and pulled him away from Ranma and Akane. "The two of you boys aren't allowed to say a word until lunch," she ordered. "I'm sick of the fighting!"<p>Inuyasha leaned in closer to Kagome. "He's in love with that girl," he whispered in her ear. "Only he won't admit it. What a loser!" But when he glanced over at Kagome, she had not only dropped his arm, but she'd turned away and was completely ignoring him. "I don't know what YOUR problem is," he mumbled.<p>*****<p>The rain had long gone, and the sky hovered above the group in a bright blue as they reached a clearing next to the river. Ranma hadn't said a word since Akane pulled him from the ground and called him a jerk. His clothes were almost dry, and very loose. He'd tightened his belt around his pants and considered his rotten luck. Not only was he five hundred years in the past protecting his uncute fiancé, but he was a girl, and there wasn't any sign of hot water.<p>Akane punched him in the arm. "Quit moping. We'll start a fire when we stop for lunch and get you some hot water."<p>"As long as I don't have to eat your food," Ranma grumbled.<p>"What was that?" Akane demanded, spinning around and balling her fists.<p>Ranma chuckled as he stopped in his tracks. "Nothing," he said. "I didn't say anything!"<p>She spun back around, and just by looking at the muscles in her back, Ranma could tell that she was still angry. If he said anything at all, she would surely turn around and hit him. He kept his mouth shut.<p>"Here we are!" Kagome announced as she pulled her yellow backpack away from her shoulders and set it on the grass. "Who's hungry?"<p>"Me!" both Ranma and Inuyasha said in unison, and then turned to glare at each other.<p>Inuyasha jutted his thumb in Ranma's direction. "This chick ain't getting MY food," he said.<p>"I'm a BOY," Ranma said in the lowest voice he could manage, which wasn't very low at all.<p>Akane gave him a shove. "Oh, quit fighting. I'm sure there's enough food for all of us. Right, Kagome?" she said as she set her own pack down next to Kagome's. "And just to be sure, I brought some food of my own. Please, help yourselves."<p>Ranma groaned as he watched his fiancé take out a paper bag and pull out some rice balls. "I think I'll go for..." he started, but before he could finish, Akane gave him the meanest glare he had ever seen. "Ah... I'm not very hungry," he said instead.<p>"You just said you were, Ranma..." she said, her face suddenly contorting into an awkward smile. "Why don't you try a rice ball?"<p>Ranma blinked, and the next time he opened his eyes, there was a big, deformed rice ball under his nose. "Um, no thanks, Akane," he smiled and tried to push her away. "But my stomach isn't feeling all that great. I think I'm going to start a nice fire." His stomach growled just as he finished.<p>Akane stuffed the rice ball into his mouth and grinned at him. "And you better like it!" she told him.<p>Ranma tried his best to keep a cool expression on his face, but Akane's food tasted like sawdust that had been doused in hairspray. Barely chewing, he swallowed the lump and waited for her to ask what he thought.<p>But she only glared. Behind her, both Inuyasha and Kagome were watching him expectantly, wondering if he'd grin and bear it, or run to the bushes and hurl. Ranma didn't know what to do.<p>"How does it taste, Ranma?" Akane said as her knuckles turned white.<p>"I think I'm going to go start a fire," he said, and tried to turn around, but Akane grabbed his pigtail and jerked him back.<p>"Ranma..."<p>He grinned despite the awful taste that still lingered on his tongue. "It was so good and filling, Akane, that I just couldn't possibly eat another!"<p>"Wow," Inuyasha gaped from behind Akane. "You must really love her to lie like that."<p>Kagome hit him hard in the arm, and he winced. Ranma only felt his face heat up as Akane turned an even brighter shade of red.<p>"I-I don't love her!" Ranma stuttered beneath Akane's bright glare. "Our parents—" He stopped.<p>The Shikon shard that hung from her neck suddenly lit up. Akane's eyes blinked twice, and then filled with tears so big, that they could barely keep from falling.<p>"A-Akane...?" Ranma said, finally taking a step toward her instead of away. "Did you step on something sharp or something?"<p>Her pained eyes narrowed at him, and when she raised her hand, Ranma didn't have a chance to escape before she slapped him right across the face.<p>"You're such a jerk, Ranma!" she screamed at him. "I hate you! I wish you weren't even here at all!"<p>Ranma blinked at her as she fled off into the woods. "Ah, shit," he grumbled.<p>*****<p>'He's forgotten about me,' Akane thought as she leaned back against a large tree trunk. She'd been sitting there for so long that her legs were beginning to fall asleep, but still, Ranma hadn't come after her.<p>Her head felt fuzzy, like their argument had only been a sort of a dream. She didn't quite know why she was so upset, but when he had said he didn't love her, her heart had felt like it sank into the depths of her stomach. After that, there was no stopping the tears. And she didn't even care how hard she hit Ranma, or if it left a bruise. He deserved it. For him to say that in front of Kagome and Inuyasha, she only wished she could have hit him even harder.<p>Her downcast eyes fell upon the Shikon shard, and she sighed. What the hell was it doing to her, anyway? Every time she looked at it, or even thought of it, her head felt light, and her body; almost numb.<p>She heard a rustle behind her and turned to look. Ranma stood there, his hands behind his back, and when their eyes met, his cheeks flushed a bright pink. "How long have you been standing there?" she asked him.<p>"Not long," he mumbled. "Kagome got me some hot water."<p>"I see that."<p>He walked over to where she sat and took a seat next to her on the grass. She felt warm with him so close by, and more tears filled her eyes.<p>"Hey, stop crying," he said, and when she peeked up at him, his wide blue eyes were right next to her face, looking in. "I didn't mean to make you cry like that."<p>She buried her face back into her arms. "I don't even know why I'm crying," she admitted in a mumble. "Ever since I put this necklace on I feel so weird. I mean, YOU make me feel weird, Ranma."<p>"Um... I do? What do you mean?"<p>His voice sounded so sincere, so caring, that she almost threw her arms around him... but stopped herself just in time. "I don't want to talk about it," she muttered, and then slowly raised her eyes back to his. "Did you really think my rice ball was horrible?"<p>Ranma turned his eyes away and gave a nervous chuckle. "Well..." he said, his eyes darting around like a million possible things to say were going through his mind. "I've had worse..." He braced for the blow.<p>But Akane didn't hit him. Maybe he was trying to be nice. Maybe he didn't want to hurt her feelings. Instead of hitting him, she put her head on his shoulder and sighed.<p>*****<p>Up in the tree above their heads, Inuyasha sat watching Ranma and Akane. He didn't care how many times Ranma said he wasn't in love with her, to Inuyasha, even though Kagome had accused him many, many times of being insensitive, it was completely obvious that Ranma was head over heels for Akane.<p>Not that he cared or anything. The only reason he was watching them was for one simple reason: the Shikon shard. Inuyasha would never let it out of his sight. Not even for a second.<p>-<p>Comments to Readers:<p>dragon_game – Thanks for reading! I'm glad you like the story :D I'm not sure about Tetsusaiga either... Hasn't he used it on humans before? I can't think of those guys' names... lol.<p>Andrina – Thank you! If you ever find any grammar mistakes, please feel free to point them out! I only want to improve :D<p>Nichole Hibiki - Wow, I knew that Ranma and Inuyasha were similar, but I never thought of Ranma being Inuyasha's reincarnation. VERY interesting idea! I'm not sure if that fits in with this story, but it's definitely a fantastic idea! About Ryoga, he won't be coming to the feudal era, but Inuyasha could possible meet him in Modern time later in the story :D<p>Alex Ultra – Thanks for reading! I'll try my best to update more regularly than I have in the past. You make some major points about Ranma being much more skilled than Inuyasha. I might have spoken a little hastily when I said that Inuyasha would beat Ranma hands down... *rethinking...*<p>Black Hammer Girl – I'm very glad you like the story! I hope you continue to read!<p>Elysium and Lonely Soul – Lonely soul, you're such a fantastic reviewer. I love reading your reviews! Ranma and Akane are my all time favorite Anime couple... And I plan on picking on them for a while longer. Hehe. I Hope you like what's to come!<p>jeremiah - You're another person who pointed out Ranma's abilities and how he would be more than capable of beating Inuyasha in a fight. I think they'd be a pretty even match! And thank you so much for the link, I will definitely use that as a reference later on in the story :D<p>Tyrean – Thank you for the advice! Right now, Inuyasha is coming off almost mean and insensitve compared to Ranma, but once they get to know each other better, I think they'll be more even toward each other. As for fighting (if they DO fight each other seriously in the story... I'm not sure yet), I will definitely keep them both even!<p>InuMiko – You're fantastic! I love your reviews, and I always look forward to your comments on deviantart, too! I'm really glad you like the chapter, and I hope you like this one, too! :D<p>- Chapter 6 coming soon! :D
