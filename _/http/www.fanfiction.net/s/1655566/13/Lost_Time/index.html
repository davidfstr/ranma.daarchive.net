</div><p><b>Author's Note:</b> Thanks for all of the reviews... even the  threatening ones. LOL... I'm not sure if I should be flattered or  afraid. Anyway, I'm really sorry that it's taken me so long. I just  graduated college and my last semester was a REALLY hard one. I hope to  eventually finish this story, but since it's been so long since I've  written it, I'm not sure how quickly the chapters will be written from  here on out. But I honestly haven't forgotten!<p><b>Lost Time<br/>Chapter 12 –  Connected<br/>By: Lori Finnegan</b></p><p>Ranma grabbed onto  another small rock with his other hand and tried to pull himself up.  "I said I can make it up on my own!" he insisted, looking up at  Inuyasha… but he was gone. He tried to wedge his left foot into the  side of the cliff, but the rock crumbled, and his fingers slipped  away from their hold.</p><p>'This is it,' he  thought, staring up at the two fingers that still held to the edge.</p><p>A hand clapped onto his  wrist, and sharp fingernails dug into his skin. Before he could  protest, he was being pulled up over the side of the cliff and  crawling onto solid ground.</p><p>"You asshole!" he  yelled at Inuyasha. "I told you I could do it myself!"</p><p>"Heh!" Inuyasha  said, turning his nose into the air. "You were about to fall!"</p><p>"I was just about to  swing myself up!" Ranma insisted.</p><p>Inuyasha glared over at  Ranma. "You pathetic human. You would have died if I didn't help  you. You should be bowing to me and thanking me for saving your  life."</p><p>"Like hell!" Ranma  scoffed. "Why should I thank you for helping me when I didn't  even need your help? When I asked you to stay the hell away?"</p><p>"Say whatever you  want to say. The fact of the matter is that you ran away, got  yourself into some shit, and then relied on me to save your sorry  ass. Don't make it out to be any different than it is."</p><p>Ranma stood up and  glared down at his ex companion as he squeezed his bloody fists until  they stung. "The reason I left was because you don't seem to have  your priorities in order. Saving Akane should be number one. Who  cares about some stupid shard?"</p><p>"Some stupid shard?"  Inuyasha echoed in disbelief as he stood up and stepped closer to  Ranma. "For your information, your fate relies on what happens to  that stupid shard. If Naraku uses the whole Shikon jewel, then you  AND Akane will both be dead along with the rest of us."</p><p>Suddenly, the world  started spinning, and the next thing Ranma knew, Inuyasha had grabbed  his collar and lowered him to the ground.</p><p>"Dammit," Inuyasha  muttered, peeling the folds of torn fabric away from Ranma's back.  "You've lost a lot of blood."</p><p>Ranma sat, holding his  head in his hands. The pain from the cuts in his back had hit him  head on. "I'm fine," he said. "I just need to sit here for a  second."</p><p>"You don't look  fine."</p><p>"I'm FINE!" he  yelled, but just as the words left his lips, another rush of  dizziness came. "Ugh."</p><p>Inuyasha squatted down  next to him. "I need to get you to Kagome. She has a box of special  healing stuff."</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow  at him. "You mean a first-aid kit?"</p><p>"Whatever,"  Inuyasha mumbled as he turned around. "Climb on my back. I'll  take you down the cliff. Kagome and your stupid friend are down  there."</p><p>"That moron is not my  friend," Ranma glared.</p><p>Inuyasha glanced back  at him. "What are you waiting for, Ranma? Don't you wanna save  Akane?"</p><p>Ranma blinked at him.  "Of course, I do," he said as he grabbed onto Inuyasha's shirt  and pulled himself up.</p><p>Five minutes later,  Kagome dabbed Ranma's wounds with a damp piece of cloth. "Don't  be such a baby, she said as he cringed. "If I don't clean your  wounds, they'll only get infected and hurt more."</p><p>Ranma gritted his  teeth. He felt like a first rate loser. Not only did he fail to think  through his plan to go off on his own, but he'd gotten pretty hurt  and had to be carried down the cliff… but Inuyasha, no less! He  still felt a little light headed, but he was doing better after  drinking plenty of water from Kagome's canteen. Once she had him  all bandaged up, he carefully put his torn shirt back on. If he was  going to find Akane and fight for her safety, he was going to have to  be in top shape!</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Naraku-sama?"  Naraku heard Kanna say at the doorway.</p><p>"What is it," he  demanded, not bothering to turn his head.</p><p>"The girl is not  well. She's been crying since last night and won't stop. I don't  know how to calm her."</p><p>Naraku flicked a speck  of dirt from beside his futon. "It's just as I feared," he  muttered. "She's dying of despair. Place the charm like we  discussed. We have no other option. If the girl dies, then so does  the shard, and I will never have the completed Shikon jewel."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane sat in the corner  of a small bedroom, curled into a tight ball. She had been crying so  long that there were no longer any tears to cry. Now, she only hurt.  Nothing mattered if she couldn't see Ranma anymore.<p>Where was Ranma?  Shouldn't he have saved her by now? And if he wasn't thinking of  her, then what was he thinking of?</p><p>"Ranma…" she  cried, burying her face between her knees and sobbing dry tears.</p><p>At the moment, the door  opened and the little girl who held the mirror appeared.</p><p>"Look into my  mirror," she said, and Akane couldn't help but do so. A small  stone the same as the one which hung from her beads materialized in  the center of the mirror before floating out and towards her.  Painlessly, it plunged within her chest, and made her heart numb. She  wasn't sure if she felt better or worse… and then, she blacked  out.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma clenched at his  chest in pain. He had been resting alone that evening when his heart  suddenly ached like nothing he had ever felt before. After a few  moments of intense pain, it became a dull ache, but he still worried.  Maybe his wounds had been deeper than he had originally thought.<p>"Hey," Inuyasha's  voice came from behind him. "You okay?"</p><p>Ranma turned his head  around. The second his eyes met with Inuyasha's, a loud voice  echoed between his ears.</p><p>"Kill him."</p><p>He clamped his hands  over his ears and squeezed his eyes shut. So maybe he didn't  particularly care for Inuyasha, but the guy HAD saved his life. Ranma  definitely didn't want to kill him. Something odd was going on…</p><p>"I… I…" he  sputtered, squinting at the other boy. "I heard a strange voice…"</p><p>Inuyasha stepped back  from him. "What did it say?"</p><p>The voice came back.  "You'll never find your girlfriend if you let Inuyasha live. He's  holding you back. KILL HIM."</p><p>Ranma pressed his into  his hears. It was coming from within him! But… those weren't his  thoughts. He knew that much.</p><p>"What did it say?"  Inuyasha repeated, this time louder.</p><p>"Get away from me!"  Ranma yelled at him.</p><p>"What? Why? Tell me  what the voice is saying!" Inuyasha stepped closer until he was  close enough to grab Ranma's arm. He held onto it so tightly that  Ranma could feel his sharp nails digging into his skin.</p><p>"Do it NOW!" the  voice screamed.</p><p>"No!" Ranma yelled  back, and Inuyasha grabbed his other arm. "It's saying that…  that I should kill you," he finally spat out.</p><p>Inuyasha continued to  stare at him. "What else?"</p><p>"That you're  holding me back. That I'll never find Akane if I don't kill you  now," Ranma cringed under Inuyasha's claws.</p><p>"When you were alone,  did you run into anyone else besides Kouga and those bird demons?"  Inuyasha wanted to know.</p><p>Ranma shook his head.</p><p>"I have Akane," the  voice went on as Ranma sank to the dirt, released from Inuyasha's  grasp. "If you listen to me, I'll give her back to you unharmed."</p><p>"Don't listen to  the voice," Inuyasha advised. "I'm guessing it's Naraku  messing with you."</p><p>"He's only saying  that because he doesn't want to die. He knows that he'll never be  able to help you find Akane. Kill him now and get it over with."</p><p>Ranma put his hands  back over his hears. "Get away from me!" he yelled at Inuyasha.  "I have to find Akane on my own! This voice is trying to control  me, and I don't want the rest of you to get hurt. Let me take care  of this by myself."</p><p>"The hell I will!"  Inuyasha growled. "I'm getting the entire Shikon jewel whether  Akane's involved or not! There are more important things than the  life of one measly human!"</p><p>Ranma stood up on his  feet. Now he really wanted to kill him. "More important things than  Akane!" he echoed in disbelief.</p><p>"Look, Ranma, or  whatever the hell your name is, I know you're in love with her and  all, but that doesn't change the fact that you're both  insignificant humans who don't even matter. I should have just  killed Akane and took her shard when I had the chance. Then none of  us would be in this—"</p><p>"SIT! You MORON!"</p><p>Inuyasha landed face  first into the dirt, and Ranma could only stare blankly at the top of  his head. He suddenly felt really tired.</p>
