</div>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranma ½ or Inuyasha... though I really wish I did!<p>A/N – Comments to reviewers at the end of the chapter :D Also, The Lost Time comic now has 64 pages! The link is posted on my authors page... check it out!<p>-<p>Lost Time Chapter 9 By: Lori Finnegan<p>"We're here," Inuyasha announced, stopping abruptly at the end of the forest. A seemingly abandoned village stretched out before them, and lonely cliffs reached over from above the rustic shacks. Ranma and Kagome climbed down from Inuyasha's back and looked around.<p>"This," Ranma said, his voice sounding loud against the silence. "This is where you think Naraku has Akane?"<p>"If you're sure your woman didn't ditch you and go back to the well," Inuyasha countered in a slightly more serious voice. "Then I'm sure she's with Naraku. I'm not certain that they're here, but it's my best guess."<p>"Oh, just great!" Ranma threw his arms into the air. "We don't even know where we're going!"<p>"There!" Kagome's finger shot straight ahead. "I sense one... no two Shikon shards, right at the end of those houses!"<p>"Akane..." Ranma said under his breath as he stared out at the town. "Well, what are we waiting for?"<p>-<p>Ryoga found himself in a heap at the bottom of the well, but he hadn't felt the landing. Was that little kid right? Had he made it through time? He stood up and looked around, noticing the vines that lined the walls of the well. Well, at least it was a dry well...<p>"Kagome!" a kid's voice squealed, echoing down into the well and off the walls. Ryoga looked up to see a small face peering over the edge.<p>"I'm not Kagome," he called back up. "But apparently my friends are with her. Do you know where she is?"<p>"Kagome-san is gone," a deeper voice said, but Ryoga couldn't see his face. He began to climb out of the well. "She left us a note," the voice went on, but he was talking to the child. "They went to find Naraku. We're supposed to meet up with them."<p>Just before Ryoga reached the top, the man's face looked down at him.<p>"Who are you?" the man wanted to know.<p>"Ryoga Hibiki," Ryoga replied. "I'm looking for my friends. They're apparently with your friend, Kagome." He climbed over the ledge of the well and looked around at the trees. "Oh, no! This looks different! Am I lost?"<p>The man, dressed in a purple robe, rubbed his chin as he stared at Ryoga. "Hmm... you're from Kagome's world?"<p>Ryoga gazed back at him skeptically. "I guess... Hey, do you know where I am?"<p>"You're in Japan. I'm Miroku, and this is Shippo." He pointed to the little boy, who smiled, bearing fangs. Behind him was a bushy tail.<p>Ryoga jumped. "You're a... a..."<p>"A fox demon!" Shippo exclaimed, giving Ryoga an even bigger grin.<p>"You must be a friend of the girl that Kagome-san mentioned in her letter. She apparently has a shard around her neck," Miroku went on, "Is that so?"<p>"Akane!" Ryoga said, his eyes widening as he took a few steps closer to the two of them. "You have to take me to her!"<p>-<p>It had been a long time since Akane had first opened her eyes after being kidnapped. The boy still stood guard over her, but he rarely spoke. All the light seemed to be gone from his eyes.<p>"What's your name?" she asked after a long moment of silence.<p>He looked down at her. "He calls me Kohaku."<p>"Who does?"<p>"Naraku."<p>The mere mention of the name sent a chill down her spine. This was the same guy that Inuyasha and Kagome spoke of... and there was no doubt about it, that he was just as dangerous as they said. She pretended that the name didn't affect her. "Sit down, Kohaku," she said. "Your legs must be tired from standing so long."<p>But Kohaku only stared at her, unmoving. Akane didn't know what to do. 'Ranma...' she thought as she leaned back against the wall. 'Ranma, where are you?'<p>Just as she was about to close her eyes again, the door flew open, slamming against the wall, and filling the room with a bright white light.<p>-<p>Ranma squeezed his fingernails into the palms of his hand until everything went numb. He felt the blood rushing to his head and didn't let his breath out until his head felt so heavy, he thought he might pass out. He stopped walking and put his hands on his knees, breathing deeply. He felt so helpless in this world. Not only was everything completely unfamiliar, but the way Inuyasha was talking up these demons made Ranma afraid for Akane's life.<p>He felt a hand on his shoulder and turned his head to see Kagome standing beside him.<p>"Here," she said, handing him a canteen. "You don't look so good."<p>"He's worried about his woman," Inuyasha butted in, causing Ranma to straighten up immediately. "And if I'm right about Naraku, he wouldn't hesitate on anything in order to get that shard away from her neck."<p>Ranma felt the blood rush from his face and down to his toes in an instant. Did Inuyasha really think that...<p>Kagome hit Inuyasha's shoulder hard. "Stop it!" she demanded. "You're not making things any better."<p>Ranma's chest felt heavy, and so did his legs. When Kagome and Inuyasha continued on, he didn't follow them. Kagome turned back and took his arm, pulling him alongside her.<p>"Don't listen to him," she said in his ear. "He's only trying to prove what an insensitive jerk he is."<p>"Yeah," Ranma mumbled, swallowing hard.<p>"We're getting closer to the Shikon shards," Kagome said loud enough so that Inuyasha could hear her, too.<p>"I'm surprised we haven't run into any traps yet. This is starting to look more and more suspicious," Inuyasha muttered back as his hand clenched Tetsusaiga at his waist, ready for anything that came his way.<p>-<p>Ryoga held tightly to the girl's waist as they flew high above the clouds on a large fire cat's back. Miroku and Shippo sat in front of her. "Sango?" he said her name, when the cat lowered into a cloud. "Are you sure this thing is safe?"<p>Sango smiled back at him. "Kirara has never let us down!" she assured him. "So, don't worry. Besides, we're almost there."<p>Ryoga nodded, looking down at the green earth below his feet. Were Ranma and Akane really down there somewhere?<p>-<p>The closer they stepped toward the Shikon shards, the more deserted the village seemed. The wind that kissed Ranma's cheek felt cold and lonely, and the dirt beneath his shoes shifted so noisily that he could have sworn he heard his footsteps echo against the cliffs.<p>Inuyasha stopped so abruptly, that both Ranma and Kagome slammed into his back. He held out his arms so they wouldn't fall. "Shh," he hushed as he sniffed the air. "Naraku's filthy scent is all over this place. He's definitely been here."<p>The wind suddenly picked up, and the three of them braced their feet to the dirt. Dark clouds rolled above their heads as the trees swayed to the whistling of the wind. A rusty hinged wooden door flew open the shack before them, and a woman with red eyes and a white fan covering the remainder of her face, appeared in the doorway. She chuckled, her tone sinister.<p>"Feh," Inuyasha scoffed. "Kagura."<p>"Who else?" she replied, removing the fan from her face and moving it behind her back. "Naraku has asked me to tell you to give up. We have far more shards than you do. How many do you have now? Oh, yes, that's right... one," she smiled at them, her eyes sparkling.<p>Inuyasha lifted Tetsusaiga from its sheath, and raised it above his head. He looked over at Kagome. "Take Ranma, and step aside," he told her. "I'll take care of Kagura."<p>When Kagome grabbed his sleeve, Ranma pulled away from her. "You're kidding me, right?" he yelled at Inuyasha over the screeching wind. "You think I'm just going to stand there when Akane's in danger?"<p>Inuyasha only glared at him. "If you know what's good for you, you'll go with Kagome. If you want to stay here and fight, I won't protect you. You're on your own."<p>"Whatever!" Ranma yelled back. "I don't need your help, and I don't need your protection. I can take care of myself, and I can protect Akane without you behind me."<p>"Fine!" Inuyasha said, his voice raising.<p>"Oh, please," Kagura's voice butted into their burning gazes. "I don't have all day."<p>The heel of Ranma's hand connected with Inuyasha's shoulder blade, and he pushed hard, shoving the other boy away from himself so he could stare straight at Kagura. "Tell me," he demanded. "Tell me where you're hiding Akane!"<p>Kagura's eyes only narrowed at him. "I've never seen you before," she said, looking him up and down. "Are you one of that half demon's friends, or did you just wander into the village?"<p>Ranma could feel his face heat up. "I asked you where Akane was," he repeated, his voice strained.<p>Kagura looked up as though she was thinking hard. "Hmm... Akane... Akane, I don't know any Akanes."<p>"Don't play dumb, you idiot!" Inuyasha growled from behind Ranma. "She's the girl with the shard around her neck. Tell us where she is!"<p>"Oh!" Kagura explained, a thick smile spreading over her face and lighting up her red eyes. "Well, let's just say she's taken care of."<p>-<p>Inuyasha watched as Ranma ran toward Kagura. He jumped into the air, feet first, and it looked as though he planned on landing a kick to her skull. Kagura simply waved her fan, sending him flying back to where he came from. Ranma's body flew into Inuyasha's, and they both landed hard on the dirt.<p>"Get the hell off of me!" Inuyasha growled, shoving Ranma off of his chest. "What the hell do you think you're doing jumping at her like that?"<p>"Now I know her moves," Ranma said, a determined grin forming on his face as he brushed the dust away from his shirt."<p>"Yeah, you only get killed in the process," Inuyasha responded as he stood up and then grabbed Ranma's sleeve. "Go stand by Kagome while I take care of her before she tears you apart."<p>Ranma hit his hand away and stood up on his own. "I told you," he said, his voice strong. "I'm not giving up until I have Akane back. I'd rather die."<p>"Then you're dumber than you look," Inuyasha said as he turned his back on Ranma and faced Kagura again.<p>"Lucky for you," Kagura said as she pulled the tiny feather from her hair. "There's no need to fight me today. I'm only here to deliver word from Naraku."<p>Both Ranma and Inuyasha blinked at her.<p>"The shard you seek is unreachable to you. So, don't even bother trying to find it," she told them, and then threw the feather before her feet. A loud popping noise sounded and before Inuyasha could blink, Kagura was floating high into the air.<p>"Dammit!" Inuyasha fumed. "I was counting on her to lead us to the shard!"<p>Kagome ran up to them, stopping between the two. "But I know it's here. I can sense the shard. It's—" She pointed off to the left, but the moment Inuyasha and Ranma looked to where her finger pointed, they all realized that there was nothing there to point at.<p>"There's nothing there," Ranma pointed out the obvious, only to be jabbed in the ribs by Inuyasha.<p>"Kagome's never wrong," he growled. "If she says the shard is there, then it's there."<p>Ranma glared back at him, "Unless Akane's up in the tree, then she has to be wrong!"<p>Inuyasha ignored him and watched as Kagome neared the spot she had pointed to moments before. With her hands outstretched, she stepped forward, and then stopped.<p>"Inuyasha!" she called out, and Ranma spun to face her, too.<p>"There's a barrier here!"<p>-<p>Akane sat up straight. About a half hour ago, a man had come in and told Kohaku he was needed, and now she was alone.<p>Softly, and in the distance, she thought she heard voices. And one of them sounded like Ranma's! She stood up and ran to the door.<p>"Ranma!" she called as she pressed her hands against the wood. "Ranma, is that you!"<p>-<p>Ranma put his hands on the barrier, and pressed his nose up against it. He only saw a bright red light as the barrier held him back. "Akane!" he yelled to the barrier, but didn't hear a response. "Akane, if you're in there, and you can hear me, we're gonna get you out! Don't worry!"<p>-<p>Comments to Reviewers:<p>Joseph D. Hale - Thanks so much for all of the ideas! And I'm glad you're enjoying the story :D<p>Akiko-chan17 – Yay! I'm so glad you like the manga! I've been working really hard on it! TnM has been working hard, too! I actually have a bunch more pages up on the site, so go check it out! (the link is on my author's page)<p>Phantom Crossing – Yes, Akane/Ranma and Kagome/Inuyasha are VERY similar! Glad you like the story!<p>Kyo-chan – Sorry it took me so long to update, but I've been working on the Lost Time Comic, too. I will DEFINITELY continue this story :D<p>name: who wants to know? - Cute name! lol. And don't worry, I won't forget about this story! I'm completely obsessed with it! Thank you for the compliment (<p>roses in bloom –See? Ryoga has people to help him find his way. Otherwise he would never find Akane or Ranma!<p>WeaselGirl – I'm so glad you still like the story! Hope you're still reading! :D<p>Mai - Thanks! I actually have a story that could be turned into a comic, but right now I'm too busy working on Lost time to think about that. Thank you though!<p>Ainulindale – lol, you're like me. I'm actually supposed to be studying for finals right now, but instead I finished writing chapter 9 and now I'm writing reviews to viewers. I haven't come across ANY good Ranma/Inuyasha crossovers... which is why I wrote one. I'm glad that you think mine is good!<p>Koala Kitty – Hey! Thanks for commenting on my story! Yours are AWESOME! I actually have a chapter of your newest to read. The alert is sitting in my inbox :D Hope you're still reading!<p>trunks6898 –You're welcome! I love commenting back to reviewers :D The Inuyasha/Ranma relationship is one of my favorites to write. I figured they wouldn't get along since their personalities are so similar. They're both too cocky to let someone else take the lead. Lol<p>DangerousElixer – Yay! I'm glad you like the comic! If you go back to that page, I've updated it with a ton more pages! And you got a little of Sango and Miroku in chapter 9 :D more to come in the future!<p>Draconic Ban-sidhea – It would have taken Ryoga YEARS to find Ranma and Akane, but luckily Sango and Miroku were there to help him! :D Look for a lot more Ryoga getting lost jokes in this story. Hehe Sesshoumaru will be in the story later... ;)<p>kirayasha aka kira – Kira, you're the best! Thanks so much for the Lost Time fanart! I LOVE IT! I'm so glad you're enjoying the story, and I hope you like this chapter too!<p>Dragon-eyes22 – Hey! Hope all is well ( I wrote your suggestion in my deviantart journal :D Hope you liked this chapter, too!<p>-<p>Another note from me...<p>Hopefully it won't take me so long to write chapter 10. I was unclear about the plot for a little bit, but I think I have everything settled and know where exactly I'm going with this fic. Please leave a review! They really make my day :D (and then go check out the Lost Time comic! The link is located on my author's page ( )
