</div>Disclaimer: Nope... I don't own any of these characters. (well, except the old man at the beginning of the story. lol...) Don't sue!<p>A/N –Comments to reviewers are at the bottom of the story... PLUS... some BIG LOST TIME NEWS! :D Sorry it took so long to get this chapter out... After you read the news at the bottom of the page, you'll see why. I've been one busy girl!<p>-<p>Lost Time Chapter 8 By: Lori Finnegan<p>"Over here!" Sota yelled to Ryoga as the two of them raced up the backside of the shrine. At the top of the hill rested a medium sized house and a small building off to the side. Suddenly, Sota stopped and turned around to face Ryoga. "I was spying on my sister last night," he said in a hushed voice. She was with her friend Inuyasha, but she had two other people with her, too... a boy with a black pigtail, and a girl with short hair wearing a blue dress."<p>"That's them!" Ryoga exclaimed, but Sota held up his hands in alarm.<p>"Shh!" the boy hissed. "No one's supposed to know that my sister isn't really sick! I'll get in huge trouble!"<p>Ryoga nodded his head in agreement. "I'll be quiet," he promised.<p>"My sister found a secret passageway to Feudal Japan. That's where Inuyasha's from. It's a long time ago, and she's trying to collect all of the shards from the Shikon jewel. It was late when she got home, and since I had seen Inuyasha come out of the well, I knew that Kagome would be going back with him. I saw them from out of my window upstairs." He pointed to the house. "Your friends went in to the well house with them, but no one came out. I'm sure that they're with Kagome in the Feudal era."<p>Ryoga's eyes went wide. "Feudal Japan? How will I ever find them in feudal Japan!"<p>"Don't look so scared. All you have to do is jump down the well," Sota exclaimed. "They're on the other side... somewhere."<p>Ryoga blinked at him. "How will I ever find them?"<p>"I told you," Sota said, looking impatient. "Jump down the well."<p>"Okay," Ryoga nodded. "Just tell me how to get there."<p>"Are you stupid? It's down the well!"<p>Ryoga stared at him for a second. "And where is this well?"<p>Sota pointed over to the well house. "Inside there. Just jump in already!"<p>"Right!" Ryoga exclaimed, grinning. "Thanks so much for your help!" and he turned around and began walking down the hill.<p>"You moron!" Sota yelled after him. "The well isn't that way!"<p>*****<p>The sun beat down upon the top of Ranma's head, and the hot water that Kagome poured over his head, didn't help his problem. The day was so hot, that he thought he might pass out from heat exhaustion. Maybe he should have stayed a girl for a day.<p>"Here you go, Ranma," Kagome said, placing a cup of instant ramen in front of him.<p>He pushed it away. "I'm not hungry."<p>Inuyasha looked up from his ramen, noodles poking out of his mouth and widened his eyes at Ranma. "Not hungry?" he mumbled, aghast. He paused to slurp up his noodles, and then gave Ranma a knowing look. "Oh," he said. "I see. You miss your girlfriend."<p>"She's not my girlfriend, and yes, I'm worried!" Ranma snapped back at him. "Wouldn't you be worried if it happened to Kagome?"<p>"Ha!" Inuyasha scoffed. "It's already happened to Kagome, and I always save her. You must be too girly and too puny to do anything about your woman." He took another bite of ramen, chewed and swallowed. "Not that Kagome's my woman," he added.<p>Next to him, Kagome's face was bright red. Ranma thought she might start blowing steam soon. Inuyasha seemed oblivious to her anger.<p>"Inuyasha..." she said in the same threatening voice she had used when Inuyasha had eaten the dirt off of Akane's bedroom floor a few days earlier. "SIT!"<p>Inuyasha's face plummeted into his cup of ramen before smashing it to the ground. "Dammit, woman!" he exclaimed against the grass. "What the hell did I do that time!"<p>Kagome folded her arms over her chest and looked away from him. "You need to learn to keep your mouth shut, Inuyasha. You're a lot more fun when you're QUIET!"<p>Ranma stood up, leaving his cup of ramen on the ground untouched, and walked away from his companions. He could hear them arguing with each other all the way down the hill, but when he got to the river, their voices faded away into the sounds of the water rushing down the riverbed. He sat down and looked over the edge.<p>When he had grabbed onto Akane and fell down into the well with her, without even thinking, he had thought to himself that as long as he was by her side, nothing could happen to her; that he would protect her at all costs.<p>But he had failed. Where she was, or if she was okay was now beyond him.<p>"I'll find you, Akane," he whispered to the river. "And if anything has happened to you, I'll make sure that whoever's to blame suffers the consequences."<p>*****<p>Inuyasha turned his nose up at Kagome while she continued on about how insensitive and immature he was being. "And last, but not least, you have to make fun of me in front of Ranma!" she exclaimed.<p>"I wasn't making fun of you," Inuyasha stated. "I only said the truth." When she didn't say anything, he blinked at her. "None of this matters anyway," he said. "All that matters is that we find Akane, and get the shard from her neck."<p>"Is... is that all you care about?"<p>Inuyasha leaned back on his hands as he stared at her. "Eh? I don't know what you're talking about."<p>"If you ask me," Kagome said, shoving a finger in his face. "You're afraid!"<p>"Feh," Inuyasha scoffed as he turned his nose up at her. "I'm not afraid of anything." When he felt her head on his shoulder, he looked down at her in shock. What the hell? "I told you," he said. "There's nothing that I'm afraid of."<p>She looked up at him, and their eyes met. "You're afraid that Naraku will get shard from Akane's necklace. Then, all he needs is the one in my pocket, and the two from Kouga's legs."<p>Inuyasha didn't say anything. He didn't want to admit that she was right.<p>"And poor Ranma. If he only knew what Naraku was capable of, I doubt he'd be so calm," she went on when he didn't say anything.<p>"Calm? Yeah right. He's anything but calm. He wouldn't even eat his lunch."<p>*****<p>Ranma emerged from the woods, fully intending to pull his companions up from the ground and forcing them on their way, but what he saw made him stop in his tracks.<p>Kagome and Inuyasha were cuddled up in the middle of the small clearing, their backs facing Ranma as they looked out into the sky. Well, it was more like Kagome was cuddled to Inuyasha, but he sure wasn't moving away from her.<p>Could it be? After all the times that Inuyasha had picked on Ranma because he thought that Ranma was in love with Akane, Inuyasha could have the hots for Kagome? Normally, he would have been amused. Even excited at the idea of picking on the other guy for the rest of the trip, but instead, it angered him. How dare they think of themselves when Akane was in danger!<p>To make sure they knew he was there, he cleared his throat loudly and put his hands on his hips in annoyance as they jumped apart. "Excuse me," Ranma said, raising his voice. "But shouldn't we be going? I don't know what I just interrupted, but it doesn't matter. All that I care about is saving Akane. Get up."<p>Inuyasha sprang to his feet and stomped over until he was standing so close to Ranma, that Ranma could see the fire in his amber eyes. "Listen, moron," he growled. "You're not the one who gives the orders around here. I am. And listen up. You didn't interrupt anything, so get it out of your fat head."<p>"Yeah," Ranma said, a smile sliding onto his face. "And that's why your face was all red when you jumped away from her. You idiot, I know you're lying. You've got the hots for Kagome, admit it!"<p>Inuyasha stepped back slightly, his face burning a bright red. He was obviously shocked that Ranma had come right out and said it. "I don't wanna talk to you anymore," he said, and then leaned in again. "But next time you say anything about me, I'm going to rip your head off!"<p>Ranma folded his arms over his chest. "Yeah. Right. You'll rip my head off. Whatever."<p>Inuyasha squinted at him. "Are you mocking me?" he said as his hand went right to Tetsusaiga and his fingers curled around the ratty handle. "You think you could actually BEAT me!"<p>Ranma was about to get in his fighting stance, when Kagome flew between them, putting her arms out in front of Ranma. "Stop it right now!" she yelled at Inuyasha. "You two can fight later. Right now, we need to find Akane."<p>Ranma and Inuyasha glared at each other, silently agreeing that Kagome was right.<p>*****<p>Ryoga gazed down into the well. Sota had finally grabbed him by the hand and pulled him inside the small shack, and now, he was contemplating jumping in. "Are you serious?" he said, looking down into the black pit. "If I jump in here, I'll find Ranma and Akane?"<p>Sota crossed his arms over his chest. "Not with your sense of direction," he muttered. "But it will take you to feudal Japan, and that's where your friends are. You could get lucky."<p>Lucky. Lucky wasn't a word that should be used in the same sentence as Ryoga Hibiki. He had to be the most unlucky man on earth. He turned to the boy and looked at him, unconvinced. "How do I know you're not pulling my leg?" he wanted to know. "How do I know I won't end up a pile of broken bones at the bottom of the well." Suddenly, he had a thought. "Hey, is there water in here?" The last thing he needed was to turn into a pig.<p>"It's a dry well," Sota explained. "But who knows if you'll be let through the barrier? It didn't let me through."<p>"But it let Ranma and Akane through?"<p>Sota nodded. "I told you, I saw them go in, and they didn't come out. I'm sure they're with Kagome."<p>"Well," Ryoga reasoned as he turned his gaze back to the pit of darkness. "At least I the well is dry." He was tough, he could handle the fall... and he was sure he'd be able to climb back up. "Akane, I'm coming for you!"<p>Sota gave him a strange look. "Do you always talk to yourself?"<p>Ryoga glanced back at him. "Thanks for your help kid. Wish me luck!" and he boosted himself up onto the wooden ledge of the well, hurling himself over the edge.<p>"Good luck!" he heard Sota yell down at him as he fell. "You'll need it!"<p>-<p>BIG NEWS: I've started the Lost Time comic. Yes, that's right... this story is now going to be a manga! Tasuki-no-miko from deviantart is helping me with the lineart and shading, and she's AWESOME, people! Everyone must check out our new deviantart site. I'll post the link on my  user page since for some reason I can't post links in here... and, if you really want to see the sketches of the first 20 pages, send me an email at  and I'll send you the link :D<p>Comments to Readers:<p>Tyrean – You're right about Ranma screaming like a girl. Lol... did I make him scream like a girl? I don't remember. Hehe. You're also right about Inuyasha's sensitivity toward people's feelings. I realized that as I was writing, but I wanted him to pick on Ranma so much that I sorta overlooked it... hope it didn't seem TOO out of character.<p>Super Sayian Pan – LOL, don't worry, Ryoga won't end up with the girl. I'm a total Ranma/Akane fan, and will NEVER let that happen. Hehe... keep reading!<p>Joseph D. Hale - hi! I'm really glad you're still reading. I don't think there's room in my story for your ideas, but they're really good ones! I just don't want this fic to be longer than it already will be! Thanks for your review, and I hope you keep reading :D<p>InuMiko – Yay! I'm glad you're still enjoying the story! I hope you liked this chapter, too :D<p>YamiSakura989 – Hi! I'm glad you and your cousin like the story :D and thank you for the compliments on my art. It means a lot :D The Inuyasha/Kagome scene was in this chapter... hope it lived up to your expectations! More like it soon!<p>Katie-chan - Thanks so much! Hope you keep reading :D<p>Alex Ultra – I'm glad you think my story is one of the good ones :D I have a lot of fun writing it, so it makes me happy that you guys enjoy reading it. :D<p>Elysium and Lonely Soul Lonely soul - hi again! I love your reviews! (and sorry it took me so long to get this chapter out, but I've been working extra hard on the comic lately.) Someone from Naraku's group took Akane, but she doesn't remember who or how. And, as you've guessed it, Ryoga is on his way to feudal japan! He'll be there in the next chapter :D About the Ranma/Akane pic with them dressed up as Inuyasha and Kagome... GREAT idea! I'll try and work on it soon! Thanks so much for your review! Can't wait for the next :D<p>Dragon-eyes22 – I'm really glad you're enjoying the story :D Thanks so much for reading, and no problem about the fav on deviantart. It was a great picture!<p>trunks6898 – Hey SarahT! Thanks for reading and reviewing! :hug: Sango and Miroku will actually be in the next chapter, so look for them! :D<p>Ronin S. Oath () – Yep, Ryoga made it to the well! The next question is will he make it to the other side without getting lost? (lol, sorry, yes I like to pick on poor Ryoga..) Ryoga fighting a demon... I'm not sure if I'd be very good at drawing a demon, but we'll see what comes up later in the fic :D Thanks so much for your review! I hope you continue to read!<p>PuchikoKitty – Thank you for all of your nice compliments :blush: Hope you're still reading!<p>Mai – Hi again! I'm glad you like the story and the art :D Hopefully it won't take me as long to write chapter 9 as it did to write chapter 8... hehe<p>Karomaro aka Kari () – Hmm... I guess I haven't really thought about Sesshoumaru yet. He might make a guest appearance later in the fic! Glad you liked the story! :D<p>WeaselGirl – Thanks so much! I'm glad you made an exception for my story, and I'm really glad that you thought it was worth it! Hope to hear more from you and see more of your art on deviantart :D
