</div><p>Disclaimer:  I don't own Ranma 1/2 and am doing this for the fun of it.</p><p>Authors  Note: Shameless plug in the AN at the end.</p><p>Only  you...</p><p>By  TsunamiSaotome</p><p>True to Ranma's  thoughts, he started to train Kasumi a lot harder. Kasumi had just  restarted her training, so Ranma was training her body to be able to  handle more demanding techniques and not teaching her new techniques.   In the morning after warming up and breakfast, Ranma would go over  the katas they had done in the previous few days. If he judged her  to master one of the kata, he would teach the next one described in  the scrolls. If not, they would just work on the old katas for the  next hours. After that Ranma would put Kasumi through either speed,  agility, strength, or stamina training, followed by lunch, a brief  rest period, then more speed, agility, strength, or stamina training,  then they would rerun through that mornings katas again and finally  dinner. That was considered to be a full day, but there were other  days that their routine was different. Once in a while both would  skip out on either the morning or/and the afternoon training session,  and do other things, like spend time with their mother or each other,  clean the house, or just relax for the day. In the three months that  passed since they started to train there was only one minor event  that disrupted their training.</p><p>A month and a  half ago, while running on a trail around the Inoue home one of the  rock on a steep path the two were running on gave way when Kasumi  stepped on it. She managed to stay upright even with the weighted  clothing Ranma had asked her to wear while training. The problem was  that she landed awkwardly and strained a muscle. Ranma had quickly  abandoned the exercises for the day. When he examined her he thought  that it was only a strain but wasn't sure. He cradled her in his  arms while she was protesting and grimacing at the same time. Ranma  knew that they were pushing Kasumi's training, but what was the point  of training if it was going to do more harm then good? Once he  pointed that out, the older girl stopped her protesting and let  herself be carried back home. Nodoka had confirmed Ranma's  assessment and ordered her daughter to rest for a few days. Kasumi  complained about not being able to train, but again Ranma stopped her  by saying he'd had something planned for when she got hurt. Both  women were stunned that Ranma had thought ahead.</p><p>The next  morning, when Kasumi hobbled her way into the dojo, Ranma stopped her  from doing warm-up exercises and told her to go into the middle of  the garden. When Kasumi got there she saw that there was an open  grass patch next to the pond. Ranma instructed her to carefully get  into a lotus position and began to tell her how to meditate. Like  every other exercise she been taught so far, she was able to  understand fairly quickly.</p><p>Their first  session didn't really go as planed, within ten minutes Ranma had  fallen asleep and was pushed into Kasumi's lap by a gust of wind.  Kasumi didn't have the heart to wake him, so she got out of the lotus  position and let Ranma use her lap as a pillow for the rest of the  morning. That pretty much stopped any thoughts of training for the  rest of the day. When Ranma awoke he apologized, promising her that  he would make it up later that night. Kasumi just smiled and nodded,  wondering what Ranma was going to do that night. They spent most of  the rest of the day with their mother just being together.</p><p>Later that  night, Ranma told Kasumi to go into his room and wait. By that time  Kasumi's curiosity was overflowing. A bit earlier, Ranma had gone  into town without letting Kasumi come along, stating it was for a  surprise that night.</p><p>-FLASHBACK-</p><p>Kasumi sat  nervously on Ranma's bed. She had been waiting for this all day;  especially since Ranma went to town and didn't let her go with him.  Moments later the door slowly opened and Ranma stepped in holding a  paper bag with a store seal she didn't recognize.</p><p>"Kasumi  lay down on the bed with your back to me." Ranma instructed.</p><p>Kasumi quickly  complied, resting her head on her forearms. Kasumi laid there with  the anticipation inside her growing. She took a couple of deep  breaths to calm herself. In the middle of releasing her second  breath she felt Ranma's hands start to massage her back. Within  seconds Kasumi was in bliss every time Ranma's fingers worked their  way deep into one of her muscles, and she released a deep moan.  After a couple of minutes of this, Kasumi regained a semblance of  coherent thought.</p><p>"Ranmaaaaaaaa...what  was -moan- in the bag uuunnnnnnn..."</p><p>Ranma didn't  even pause in his ministrations as he answered, "Oil and stuff.  I didn't want to get them on your clothes, so I didn't use them."</p><p>Kasumi rolled  what Ranma said around in her pleasure-clouded mind for a second.  Then snapped her eyes open and rolled off the bed.</p><p>"Kaaaaaaaaaaa..."  was the only thing a confused Ranma was able to get out of his mouth.</p><p>In the time it  took Ranma to speak that one partial phrase, Kasumi's dress had  pooled on the floor, and she was in the process of taking off her  bra. Ranma spun around so fast that he nearly twisted the top  mattress off the bed. Half a second later, he felt something clip  the back of his arm; his eyes widened as he watched Kasumi's bra land  on the floor in front of him. A few heart beats later he heard  sounds of Kasumi getting back on the bed, and on turning around he  noticed that Kasumi had made herself comfortable in his bed. He  blushed a bit deeper as he realized that he could see the side of her  breast. She was in the same position she had originally occupied,  only his blanket was also pulled up to her waist, leaving everything  above that point exposed.</p><p>"Use...It...Want...Now...Badly...Please..."  Kasumi's sultry moaning sent shivers through Ranma's entire body.</p><p>Ranma's hand  was shaking as he turned around to get one of the massaging oils he  had bought earlier. When his eyes reached the bag with the oils in  it his heart nearly stopped, his breathing became short, quick gasps,  and a drop of blood fell from his nose. There, dangling on the bag,  a pair of panties that matched the bra on the floor. His hand  trembled around the undergarment as he randomly grabbed a container  of oil. With the oil ready in his hands and hormones coursing  through his veins, Ranma turned around and admired the beauty in his  bed; a beauty that he unquestioningly knew was completely naked  underneath that blanket. Suddenly, Ranma was no longer nervous;  instead he was a bit excited. Letting a few of drops of oil fall on  Kasumi's back, he moved his hand to work on her knotted muscles. He  had only intended to massage Kasumi for around a half an hour but  ended up being at it for well over an hour. It was a few minutes  before he stopped that she fell into a contented sleep. Ranma was  very tempted to carry Kasumi to her own bed and at the same time very  nervous about the prospect of doing so when he considered her state  of dress. In the end the cons outweighed the pros, especially if  their mother saw them, so he covered Kasumi in his blanket and went  off to sleep in one of the unoccupied rooms for the night.</p><p>-End Flashback-</p><p>Kasumi had been  receiving massages regularly ever since, either once every few days  or after a particularly tough day. His mother had also recently  started to ask for massages of her own, something Ranma happily did  for his mother. And though Nodoka was nowhere as enthusiastic about  them as Kasumi, she still enjoyed the treatments very much.</p><p>Kasumi's  training had slowed down a bit, but that wasn't due to her learning  curve or the increasing difficulty levels of the techniques. The  last of the intermediate scrolls held no techniques; instead they  focused on developing the body's speed, strength, stamina and  agility, many of the techniques that the two were already using, only  on a higher scale. Along with building one's body, there were  exercises to deepen ki reserves. Ranma didn't really need to relearn  any of the exercises in the last few intermediate scrolls, so he lent  his personal experience to Kasumi in order to help her learn them  faster. This is where Kasumi believed she had stopped training  because she didn't remember doing any of the exercises. Ranma  understood why Kimiko had stopped there. At the time, when Kimiko  was training her daughter, Kasumi would have only been nine or ten  and her young body would not have been able to handle the stresses  associated with such a large reserve of ki.</p><p>This was also  the time when Ranma seriously started to spar with Kasumi. Most  people would have been angry with Ranma for waiting this long to  spar, but not Kasumi, she knew that Ranma knew that this was the best  way to fine tune her skills. Ranma would come to her when he was  ready. If not, she could always go to him. Ranma began their  sparring sessions like he did with Akane. At first she thought that  it was a way to test her control, and in a way it was, but Kasumi  quickly found out that there were other benefits. Ranma stayed at a  set speed, forcing Kasumi to abandon any thoughts of putting any real  power behind any of her strikes. Ranma was a very good judge of how  fast Kasumi could be for her skill level and set a limit just outside  of what he thought was possible for her. At first their sparring  sessions barely lasted half an hour before Kasumi would drop to the  floor in exhaustion. As Kasumi began to hold up longer in the  matches, Ranma started to throw attacks. Not very strong attacks,  but quick and light enough to force Kasumi into tightening her  defenses and perfect her technique. Then, when she got good enough  to tag him a couple of times, he would congratulate her and increase  his speed in the next spar.</p><p>Along with  sparring, Ranma also started teaching Kasumi about ki, usually doing  so on alternating days. To begin, Ranma asked her to meditate and  look inside of herself for a surging core of energy, and for days  Kasumi danced around her core of ki without being able to fully  access it. They quickly found that her ki was very different from  his; Ranma's was wild, Kasumi's was calm. Instead of opening the  door and letting it rush out like Ranma did, Kasumi had to guide it  out. After Kasumi gained access to it, Ranma had her mentally move  it repeatedly through various parts of her body to create and  strengthen the ki pathways in her body.</p><p>Within this  last week Ranma judged Kasumi to be at the levels described at the  end of the intermediate scroll that were required to begin training  in the advance scroll. When the two of them looked at the advanced  scroll for the first time, Ranma noticed something and asked Kasumi  if they could examine all of the other advanced scrolls as well.  Kasumi agreed and soon Ranma's suspicions were confirmed...</p><p>The Fallen  Angels School of Martial Arts was an... Ariel Based School.</p><p>Ranma had  recognized some techniques used to stay in the air for an extra  split-second. That was why he had originally wanted to review all of  the advanced scrolls. Now he knew why all of the ki exercises were  emphasized so much for the intermediate students. Not only did they  deepen ki reserves, they also allowed students to heal quickly if  they got hurt and, finally, they allowed a student to use their ki to  cushion their landings.</p><p>The first  lesson for the advanced class was to learn how to fall again, but  this time the student would use their ki to take the brunt of the  damage, coupled with using the basic lessons for recovering from a  fall. Reading through the text, Ranma realized that the same skill  could also be used to soften physical blows as well. Kasumi's  retraining on how to take a fall was completed very quickly, mostly  due to the fact that Ranma had a lot of experience with falling.</p><p>Ranma quickly  became much more confident in his teaching abilities once he was in  his element: aerial combat. From then on, while he was teaching, he  knew why a move was done or why a person's weight was shifted in a  certain way. If not, he used his own knowledge of anything-goes and  his incredible learning curve to figure it out. Now he could be a  real teacher for Kasumi.</p><p>Today was  supposed to be the day that Ranma helped Kasumi work on her balance  using poles as footing, but the training area was unusable. It  didn't matter if it was insects, animals, or time; the bamboo poles  were either destroyed or just falling apart with age.</p><p>When Nodoka  asked why Ranma and Kasumi had stopped training so early, Kasumi  explained the problems with the training area.</p><p>"I see.  Could you two finish making breakfast? I think I know of something  that might help." Nodoka waited a moment to receive a nod from  her son before leaving breakfast and going to her room.</p><p>Once in her  room, Nodoka started to dig through her closet, through the piles of  things she had accumulated in her past. There were certain items  that caused Nodoka to pause and reminisce about the past and,  frighteningly enough, there were even things that caused her to  blush...</p><p>Something that  could make Nodoka blush is definitely something that should not be  unleashed on the general public...</p><p>After letting  off a disturbing giggle, Nodoka found what she was looking for. It  was a picture of her and Kimiko standing in a heavily forested area  in front of a lake, or possibly a slow-moving river. Nodoka smiled  and tenderly touched the picture for a few moments before getting up  and going to her children.</p><p>The first to  see her was Ranma, who had been kicked out of the kitchen. Why, you  might ask? After Nodoka went to her room, Ranma had snuck up behind  a busy Kasumi and captured her lips and tongue with a surprise kiss.  While Kasumi was distracted, Ranma's free hand stole a fish from  breakfast and as soon as he broke the kiss, which lasted many more  seconds, he moved to the far end of the kitchen and began to eat his  prize. Kasumi looked over at Ranma to ask what the kiss was for, and  quickly discovered the answer to her question. Feigning a glare, she  pushed Ranma out of the kitchen.</p><p>"What's  that you got mom?" Ranma asked while trying to get a glimpse of  the photograph in Nodoka's hand.</p><p>"Just some  old memories." Nodoka replied and raised an eyebrow, "I  thought you were helping with breakfast?"</p><p>"Eh...hehe...Kasumi  kinda kicked me out..." Ranma embarrassedly replied with his  right arm behind him, holding his pigtail.</p><p>Nodoka shook  her head at her son's antics, "At least help me set the table  for breakfast."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>In a few  minutes mother and son were sitting at the table waiting for their  meal, using the time to talk about little inane things and how Kasumi  was progressing in her training. It was a quarter of an hour later  when Kasumi emerged from the kitchen carrying the food. She quickly  joined the conversation as if she had been part of it from the  beginning. From there breakfast proceeded like it had for the  previous few months, with a lively, warm, and caring family  atmosphere.</p><p>There was an  unspoken agreement between Ranma and Kasumi that it would be a rest  day. After the three of them cleaned up the remnants of their meal,  Nodoka gathered her children to speak with them.</p><p>"Ranma,  Kasumi could you two not train today? I want to show you something."</p><p>Kasumi looked  at Ranma and the two nodded to each other. "Okay, Ranma and I  weren't going to train today, anyway. So what did you want to show  us?"</p><p>"I want it  to be something of a surprise, so could you two go and get dressed  for a picnic, and I'll get a basket ready?" Nodoka left them,  making her way into the kitchen.</p><p>Ranma and  Kasumi shared a look tinted with fear. Their mother having a  surprise for them was probably not a good thing; surprises usually  meant both of them would be horribly embarrassed. Lately, she hadn't  been so bad, and Ranma and Kasumi shook their heads and cracked a  smile; there was nothing they could do, so they'd deal with it as it  came.</p><p>Something that  neither had yet figured out was that Nodoka was not teasing them any  less, but that they had grown used to their mother's quirks and,  thanks to her, they had grown to be a bit perverted themselves,  especially in their dealings with each other.</p><p>Soon after all  of their preparations were completed the three of them were walking  down another path that Ranma and Kasumi had yet to explore during  their time at the Inoue home. The path was a bit rockier then the  others and the trail changed from being surrounded by trees to  walking above the tops of them. The scenery was much different from  all of the other trails that Ranma and Kasumi had walked before,  while being no less beautiful. Eventually, the trail started to  descend again. The three of them soon found themselves in a small,  hidden valley surrounded by walls of rock and earth. There was a  slow moving river in the center with many trees in the surrounding  area. The most notable land marks, other then the river, were two  huge pine trees standing across from each other on opposite banks of  the river. Ranma and Kasumi quietly followed Nodoka as she made her  way to the huge tree closest to them. The three of then stopped at  what looked like a makeshift table. The centerpiece looked like it  had been cut from a huge tree, then cut in half vertically and,  finally, laid on its side with the flat end facing the sky to serve  as a table and smaller logs on each side to serve as benches.</p><p>While Ranma and  Kasumi were looking at the area, Nodoka spoke, "Ranma, Kasumi  you two can use this place for balance training. The bamboo shoots  stopped being used because of this place."</p><p>"Huh?  How?" Ranma looked around and saw nothing that would really help  with the training except for the two large trees, but those could  really only be used for a beginner as far as he was concerned.</p><p>"Ranma  look at the other side of the tree." Nodoka told Ranma as she  smoothed out the cloth that she used to cover their table.</p><p>Ranma looked at  his mother for a second longer then went to see what was on the other  side of tree. Ranma saw several notches carved into the tree to form  a ladder and pegs hammered into the tree with branches beside them to  be used by the more experienced martial artists. Ranma quickly  hopped up the branches to a platform he hadn't seen from the ground,  and noticed something else that he hadn't seen from below. There  were four metal wires, most likely steel, embedded in the tree and  running above the water into the other tree on the far bank. On  closer inspection, Ranma saw that the new set of wires was added  above an older set made of rope suggesting that this place had  started being used a long time ago. Ranma's eyes followed each of  the cables and saw that there were different colored tiles placed on  top of them with varying distances between each tile. There were  four different colors: white, green, red, and black. Ranma jumped  onto a black tile, figuring that it was intended to be used for  balance practice... and nearly fell off!</p><p>Ranma lashed  out with his hand, grabbed one of the wires and flipped onto a white  square which felt just as stable as the wire itself. He made his way  back to the black tile and poked it with a toe, easily tilting the  tile until it was perpendicular to the water below, but it didn't  fall off. Ranma thought he would have to fix this before Kasumi  could use it, and with that plan in mind Ranma hopped onto another  black square and nearly lost his balance again.</p><p>'Weird... The  white one was okay.' Ranma thought while maintaining his balance on  the tile. He then decided to test all of the tiles and after a few  jumps he realized that they were made that way on purpose, and were  not broken as he had initially thought. He figured that each color  represented a different degree of difficulty with white being the  most stable, green being more difficult then white, red would be very  difficult and black was the most difficult of the lot and only for  the advanced, or better, students. Ranma smiled. This place was a  very good training ground, and if a person fell they would hit the  water. If the student could control their fall there would be no  pain, if not it was really going to hurt. Ranma then began an  advanced Anything-goes kata, and started bouncing from tile to tile.</p><p>Down below the  two women sat and took part in one of their favorite hobbies: One  watched her son use his art while the other watched the person she  loved in the world she hoped would be hers soon. All too soon the  show ended and Ranma jumped down towards them.</p><p>"Mom, this  place is great; it's perfect for training." Ranma exclaimed as  soon as he landed in front of them.</p><p>"I know,  Ranma. You two are going to start training here tomorrow, right?"  Ranma mother asked.</p><p>Ranma nodded,  "Why'd you ask?"</p><p>"This  place holds a lot of pleasant memories for me, and I'm very happy  that you two will start to make your own memories here."</p><p>"Really,  like what?" Ranma enthusiastically sat down, waiting for his  mother to answer his question.</p><p>"I spent  many, many hours here with Kimiko." Nodoka started.</p><p>Although Kasumi  didn't outwardly show the same enthusiasm Ranma did, she still liked  to hear stories about both of her mothers. As Nodoka continued,  Kasumi quickly sat down next to Ranma.</p><p>"The one  that stands out the most is this one time that she asked me to come  here with her. Kimiko had tied two huge vines to a couple of the  branches over the water and bound each of my wrists to a vine."  Nodoka paused in consideration, "Hmmm...Now that I think about  it, it was like one of those hentais that people like to watch these  days. Those vines did look long and thick and tentacle-like..."</p><p>Kasumi nearly  jumped to cover her mother's mouth, but caught Ranma looking at her  then turn to look at two branches overhanging the water. Kasumi  looked at the spot that held Ranma's attention and her imagination  supplied her with a petite red-head dangling over the water, with a  chestnut-haired girl walking on a limb parallel to the other helpless  girl, slowly working her hands through the clothes of the girl  hanging in front of her.</p><p>"...then  she pulled it out. Kami! I don't know how she got it to move around  like that, but it felt so good when she wrapped it around me, it was  so hot and it felt like it was pulsing..." A moan then escaped  Nodoka's throat as she relived some of the sensations that had long  since passed.</p><p>Kasumi began to  blush and every time Ranma looked at her, then to that spot over the  water, she grew redder and redder.</p><p>Nodoka never  noticed the children's reactions as she was far too lost in  retelling her memories.</p><p>Kasumi's  imagination supplied her with the images of her mother's story as it  was being told. While her mind was occupied, her body started to try  finding a way to satisfy the needs suddenly rampaging in itself.</p><p>"...and  that is one of my favorite memories." Nodoka opened her eyes to  where her children had been, and were not any longer. Hearing some  rustling from behind the table, she got up to investigate. What she  found prompted her to open her mouth to speak, but her better  judgment kicked in and she found a place to sit and watch, instead.</p><p>Soon enough,  Ranma's instincts took over and he began to use his hands to  manipulate Kasumi body. In a matter of minutes Kasumi was arching  her back in relief.</p><p>Nodoka was  proud of her children and mildly annoyed at them, all at the same  time. She was proud that, even under these conditions, both Ranma  and Kasumi managed to stand by there convictions. The annoyance came  from the fact that she would have to wait just that much longer for  grandchildren.</p><p>Nodoka chose to  speak as soon as Kasumi was comfortably nestled on top of Ranma,  "Kasumi, I'm ashamed of you! Leaving Ranma unfulfilled like  that." Nodoka crossed her arms in front of her, then shifted to  a thoughtful pose, "Although, usually it's the man that leaves  the woman needy."</p><p>It was at that  moment when Kasumi realized that her mother had sat there watching  the entire thing. She tried to stand and move away from Ranma, but  her body was still suffering from the aftereffects of Ranma's  ministrations. All Kasumi could do was tip herself over and fall on  one of the makeshift benches next to the table.</p><p>"I...ummm...we...were...ahhh..."  were Kasumi's words as she tried to fight through the bliss in her  mind and body.</p><p>After a few  moments Ranma stiffly got up and limped to the water, shedding his  clothing as he got closer.</p><p>"Ranma!  You're going the wrong way! Kasumi's over here!" Nodoka  shouted the first thing that was on her mind.</p><p>Ranma ignored  his mother and stubbornly made his way to the water. He hoped it was  cold. God, he really hoped that water was cold or else he'd end up  running back over there, even with his mother watching, and ravage  Kasumi till they were both raw and unable to move for days.</p><p>By the time  Ranma dove into the water, Kasumi regained enough of her senses to at  least be able to think again. She looked around and couldn't find  Ranma but she saw her mother setting the table. "Mother?"</p><p>Nodoka smiled  when she heard her daughter call her "mother". It was  something she loved and would always make her smile. Without turning  around she answered her eldest daughter, "Hmmmm?"</p><p>"Where's  Ranma?"</p><p>Nodoka's lips  curved, and she then pointed to a trail of clothing which led to the  water's edge, "He decided to go swimming."</p><p>"Swimming?   But, we didn't bring anything to swim in..." her eyes widened  as she inventoried each piece of clothing...</p><p>Ranma, in his  struggle to reach the water, didn't care about what he was taking off  as he stripped out of everything... including his boxers.</p><p>Kasumi couldn't  help it as her eyes wandered to the water and found Ranma doing laps.   Kasumi's body began to heat up again as she saw multiple red flashes  from Ranma's, now female, body.</p><p>Nodoka turned  to her dryer daughter and waved her off in a care-free manner, "Ranma  seems to have found a way around that. You go join her and I'll call  you both when lunch is ready."</p><p>"I uhhh...  think that... I will...mmmmm... stay here and... ohhhhh... myyyyy...  help you." Oddly enough, her eyes never left Ranma's lithe body.</p><p>For some  unknown reason Nodoka didn't keep pestering Kasumi about going  swimming and began to give her tasks to keep her busy instead.</p><p>Ranma,  meanwhile, had cooled her urges sufficiently and realized that she  was skinny-dipping and every time she surfaced to take a breath she  glanced over to the shore. She wanted to go get dressed, but she  couldn't do it with Kasumi staring at her like that. Although, she  kind of liked the way the other girl was looking at her, but she  really wanted to get dressed.</p><p>A couple laps  later, Kasumi finally took her eyes off of Ranma, thanks to Nodoka.  Ranma quietly snuck back and grabbed her clothes and then, behind  another big tree, waited for them to dry sufficiently and re-dressed  herself.</p><p>When Ranma  stepped out from behind the tree, Nodoka called to her without  looking up, "Ranma, could you come here for a moment I have  something I want to talk to the two of you about."</p><p>Ranma quickly  moved and took her spot next to Kasumi.</p><p>When Nodoka  placed the last of the food in the basket on the table, she turned  and addressed her children, "You both know that we can't avoid  the people in Nerima forever, right?"</p><p>Both Ranma and  Kasumi nodded.</p><p>"I'm sure  that I'm not going to get any argument from you about this, but the  first person we'll need to deal with is Nabiki." Nodoka stated  with a dangerous look.</p><p>Kasumi opened  her mouth to defend her sister, but hesitated. She knew that with  everything Nabiki did to exploit Ranma, Nodoka had every right to be  angry. As it turned out she didn't have to say anything because,  strangely enough, Ranma was the one to defend Nabiki.</p><p>"Mom, I  know that you're angry with Nabiki but please, don't be. I know that  she used me, but it was so that she could take care of the Tendo  dojo." Ranma stopped speaking for a moment, "Well, mostly  for the dojo. I didn't like it, but it was the only thing that I  could do. Me and… the old man ate a lot, so we used up a lot of  money on food. I could have stopped or avoided her, but I didn't  want to freeload. If you could, please find a good way to deal with  her."</p><p>Nodoka closed  her eyes and smiled, "Okay, Ranma. I talked with my brother a  while back because I had a feeling you would feel that way, and this  is what we came up with..."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki sat in  her room; it had been months since Kasumi left with Nodoka and Ranma,  right now she was thinking back to the first few hours after they had  gone.<p>At first she  was very angry at Nodoka for defending her son against Akane, but  after some time she realized that she was being unreasonable and had  gone back to apologize. By the time she returned it was too late and  the three of them were long gone. When she realized that Kasumi was  also missing, her first thought was that Ranma had somehow forced  Kasumi to go with him, but half a second later she chided herself for  such an absurd thought. The first thing she did was replay the  surveillance tapes of the past couple of hours. She watched as Akane  lost her temper for apparently no reason and Nodoka defend her son.  She continued to watch as the idiot squad start screaming at Nodoka.  Nabiki still winced at the memory of what Genma had said at the time;  remembering the wave of sadness that had washed over her as she  watched a strong woman being broken because of what the fat idiot was  saying. Then came the guilt that followed from the way she had  initially reacted, a guilt that had been gnawing at her mind and soul  ever since she watched the video playback of that day.</p><p>Ever since the  day her sister left, Nabiki had been scaling back her operations at  school more and more with each passing week, only making enough to  keep her home out of the red.</p><p>Nabiki chuckled  at one of the few good memory that came from the whole situation.  That night she was invited to a slumber party by some of her closest  friends. Originally, she wasn't planning on going, but as soon she  saw that Akane had invaded and conquered the kitchen; it wasn't a  choice of whether she should go or not, the question became whether  she should bring her green Sheer Mesh Chemise or not.</p><p>Nabiki cracked  a smile at the memory of what she had seen as she walked into the  dinning room on her way out the front door. Genma and her father  were gagged and chained together and on the floor, and she judged  from the amount of sweat and their pale complexions that they had  been there for a while. The chains brought up questions of what  types of...games her sister liked playing, questions she didn't  want answers to at that particular moment...or ever, for that  matter.</p><p>At that moment,  Akane stepped out of the kitchen and asked her where she was going.  Nabiki quickly replied that she was going to a sleepover, which  caused Akane to remember being told about it earlier. Of course,  Akane was a bit saddened that Nabiki wasn't going to be around to eat  her cooking, but became happy again as Nabiki left with a parting  comment of, "Since father and Genma have always told you about  how much your cooking has been improving, the two of them will  happily eat what you made."</p><p>Nabiki couldn't  help but let out a small giggle as she relived the muffled, agonized  screams and cries of the two old men. But all of Nabiki's mirth died  as she thought of her older sister.</p><p>When she went  into the kitchen she found that all of Kasumi's favorite things were  gone. Kasumi had apparently taken everything that meant something to  her, from the apron that belonged to their mother, to the apron that  their mother bought for her, her own bowl and the notebook of recipes  that their mother started and Kasumi continued. Nabiki thought  Kasumi would have taken all of Ranma's things as well, but much to  Nabiki's dismay, even after all this time Ranma had still been  using the stuff meant for guests. This place was Ranma's home, but  at the same time it wasn't.</p><p>It was during  the sleepover that Nabiki decided to review that entire, fateful day.   The touching scene between Ranma and her mother brought tears to the  eyes of everyone in the room, even Nabiki's. As the tape continued,  everyone was surprised as they watched the three women smiling in the  video. Each and every one of them avidly watched a smile on Ranma  face that none of them had ever witnessed. Nabiki focused Kasumi's  smile; it was the only truly happy smile that Nabiki had seen on her  sister's face since their mother had died. When dinner arrived on  the screen, and Genma's words and the reactions to them were  witnessed, one of Nabiki's friends had the nerve to walk up to her  and smack her upside her head. After watching the tape again, Nabiki  knew that she deserved her friend's reprimand and a lot more. After  that, they watched as Ranma and Kasumi walked out of the Tendo home,  hand in hand, never once looking back.</p><p>When the video  finished, Nabiki started telling them about how guilty she felt.  Once she had begun, she found she couldn't stop talking, and sometime  during the bearing of her soul the tears started. Every girl in the  room went and tried to comfort the distraught girl. Each girl in the  room knew, and had the experiences to prove, that even the Ice Queen  was human.</p><p>Once all of  them had calmed down they began to talk, trying to figure out what  had set Akane off. At first, they could find no apparent reason, but  one soon became obvious.</p><p>About a week  and a half before Ranma and Kasumi left, there had been two new  transfer students. There was nothing special about them except that  they had been best friends long before the transfer. On the day that  Nodoka broke down, a few people had found out that the two boys were  planning to confess their love to a couple of girls.</p><p>Nabiki quickly  remembered that rumor; she had even helped spread it. After all, it  was a rumor that couldn't really make her any money.</p><p>The girls that  Nabiki had watching over Ranma's class quickly added that Akane had  heard the rumors from Sayuri and Yuka, as well as many of the other  students, talking about the boys intending their confessions for  Akane. It was after lunch that Akane returned to class angry, and  became angrier as the day went on.</p><p>Nabiki  instantly knew what had happened. The boys had made their  confessions at lunch, and not to her little sister, but to two of the  girls who happened to be at the sleepover. Those two, by the way,  were being stared at by the other four girls in the room as the  discussion continued.</p><p>The two girls  began telling the rest that, at the end of that school day, Akane had  approached their new boyfriends with her I'm-a-really-sweet-girl act,  but the boys had ignored her. They watched as Akane nearly lost her  temper, but turned around and stomped away instead. Then they  thanked Nabiki.</p><p>Nabiki was glad  that she had made the rule that Akane was to stay away from her  friends and their respective boyfriends. It had taken an extreme  amount of effort to convince Akane, but she was glad she did. The  reason behind Nabiki had done that to her sister was because at one  point Akane had purposely caused a couple of boys to breakup with two  of her close friends, who were also in the room, and then nearly  crippled them when the boys returned to them.</p><p>After that, the  group began to act like normal girls at a slumber party, though there  was one last thing that bothered Nabiki from the rest of the party.  She had talked to the two girls that had been dumped because of her  sister's intimidation and one of them said, "Ranma isn't a  person to leave situations open, and when he comes back it will be  closed, no matter how cruel it is to Akane." Nabiki knew that  statement would turn out to be true, and it would likely apply to  everyone in Nerima, including her.</p><p>Nabiki decided  to drop that particular thought for the time being. Whatever Ranma  did to her, she deserved, and she would calmly accept it when it  came.</p><p>Nabiki returned  her thoughts to the present. As always, everyone had come to her in  order to find out what information she had on the day after Ranma  disappeared.</p><p>The Amazons:</p><p>Cologne had  come and paid her quite a bi to search for Ranma. Shampoo came just  about every day to see if she'd found anything out. Truth be told,  she didn't look very hard the first two weeks, she didn't want to  mess up her oldest sisters chances, and she definitely didn't want to  send the Amazons after her. She had talked to a couple of people who  were the last to see them but then the trail went cold. After the  first two weeks she tried to find them to the best of her abilities,  but still didn't find anything beyond that point. Whatever Nodoka  did or whoever she hired was very good at not being found. After a  month of failure, Cologne hired a private investigator from outside  Nerima to look for them, and when the guy showed up asking her for  information, Nabiki nearly broke a rib laughing after he'd left. If  she couldn't find anything, there was no way some two-bit private eye  could.</p><p>The only thing  odd about the amazons was that Mousse had left two weeks ago from  today and hasn't been seen since.</p><p>Ukyo:</p><p>Ukyo, too, had  come to her for information and paid to be kept in the loop when any  information was found. The only recent thing Nabiki had heard about  Ukyo was that the quality of her food declined more and more the  longer Ranma went missing.</p><p>Ryoga:</p><p>Ryoga hadn't  been seen since a week before Ranma left. The only thing Nabiki  could come up with was that he had found Ranma and hadn't made it  back to Nerima yet. It was only a guess, but that was the most  probable possibility she had come across.</p><p>The Kunos:</p><p>Tatewaki paid  her every day since the disappearance, at an inflated rate, for  information about his pig-tailed goddess, then proceeded to proclaim  that he would set her free and got pummeled by her little sister.  Nabiki found out from Sasuke that Kodachi had more or less imprisoned  herself in her private wing of the Kuno mansion and had asked for  weekly supplies to be delivered to the gates of that wing. Many  students told her that they could still hear Kodachi's bone chilling  laugh every time they went near the Kuno mansion. One thing that  annoyed Nabiki was that Tatewaki made no mention of her older sister,  but it could also have been considered a good thing.</p><p>The Tendo Dojo:</p><p>Nabiki started  to smile as she remembered the changes that were brought about thanks  to Ranma and Kasumi's leaving. Genma and her father had been chained  to the dining room, attached to something that looked like a reel.  It gave the two just enough freedom to move anywhere within the  house, but it also allowed Akane to pull the two back to the table  when her next 'meal' was ready. What had surprised Nabiki the most  was that Genma hadn't been able to escape. She had expected her  father wouldn't have been able to get free, but the chains were even  able to keep Genma from escaping, which she found simply amazing.  When her father came up with an idea for escape it nearly gave Nabiki  a heart attack. Not because it was his idea, but that it was a good  idea, and he'd come up with it on his first try too. He dumped all  of the tea that Akane had made that morning all over the chain. The  tea dissolved everything including the floor and the foundation  underneath. Nabiki had ran out of string when she tried to measure  how deep the hole went. Oddly enough, it ate through everything  except the teapot, cups and chain.</p><p>Nabiki hoped  she wouldn't have to deal with removing lava from the dining room any  time soon.</p><p>Genma had  actually called Soun an idiot... that just seemed wrong for Genma to  call another person an idiot.</p><p>Genma's first  idea was to use a jelly bean, something about "it'll get  cavities and fall apart"...refer to the above statement. Some  of Genma more 'brilliant' ideas had involved nail clippers, scissors,  a rock, and trying to chew through it (which had cost Genma a couple  of teeth). Genma also had the bright idea of forcing the chain to  watch forty-eight hours of the Teletubbies and another twenty-four  hours of Barney and friends, in the middle of the telethon Nabiki had  to stop her father from committing seppuku, she also took the  television away from Genma. Genma's last plan had sent almost all of  the students at Furinkan running. The first few times Nabiki thought  about it; she lost control of herself and laughed.</p><p>Now, wouldn't  you be scared if you were walking in school, minding your own  business and then all of a sudden the Ice Queen started laughing.  Many of the students figured that the world would be ending soon and  gathered the courage to do all of the things they never thought they  could. So there were soon over a hundred new couples at Furinkan and  many more students wound up getting grounded for life. Even Nabiki  was confessed to a dozen times, and if that wasn't miraculous enough  even Gosunkugi got a few love letter confessions.</p><p>It was a month  and a half after Ranma and Kasumi vanished that Genma had had an  epiphany after hearing some people make fun of marriage and calling  it the chain of marriage. He figured all he had to do was cheat on  the chain and it would break. For the next few days, Genma scoured  the personal ads for a potential pawn. Soon after, Nabiki found both  Genma and her father passed out in the living room with an ad in the  paper circled:</p><p>Looking for a  strong martial artist. Must not have any fiancées. I am well  off and looking for a man to have a bit of 'fun' with, lots of  stamina. Also maybe a possible bodyguard in the future. Long green  hair and dark green eyes. Measurements: 32D-28-36.</p><p>Nabiki thought  that it was too good to be true, but reasoning with the idiot duo was  something not even Kami-sama could do, let alone a schoolgirl, even  one with her substantial skills.</p><p>Genma's thought  process went something like this:</p><p>'Looking for a  strong martial artist.'</p><p>Yep, describes  me perfectly. Even the master can't stand up to me if I use all of  my techniques.</p><p>'Must not have  any fiancées.'</p><p>A wife isn't a  fiancée, so I don't have to worry about that.</p><p>'I am well off  and looking for a man to have a bit of 'fun' with, lots of stamina. '</p><p>Money is good,  and I can go on for twenty-two and a half seconds. Not many men have  my monstrous stamina. (It should be noted that at this point that  Genma was puffing his chest out with pride. And how did Genma come  up with that kind of a time-frame? Well, the answer to that question  was that he had timed all of his own experiences and twenty-two and a  half seconds was his best time.)</p><p>'Also maybe a  possible bodyguard in the future.'</p><p>Ahh... That's  why she needs a strong martial artist.</p><p>'Long green  hair and dark green eyes. Measurements: 32D-28-36.'</p><p>Decent enough,  a man like me could do so much better, but I can't be too picky right  now.</p><p>Genma had then  set up a meeting for the following day. The woman had been very  excited that a practitioner of Anything-goes had responded to her ad  and, after questioning Genma to make sure that he wasn't Ranma, she  happily accepted his invitation.</p><p>When the woman  showed up, she introduced herself as Miaka. Nabiki was in shock,  even though she didn't show it, that the woman was exactly as  described in the ad. Miaka quickly discovered that Genma couldn't  leave the house at the time, nor could Soun. Miaka stated that she  didn't mind, so the three of them went to the guestroom to 'get to  know each other better'. Soon enough, the moaning started; it  quickly became too much for Nabiki, so she decided to leave the house  and go for a walk. She didn't need to worry about Akane because, in  a rare moment of intelligence, Genma had set the meeting on a day  Akane was on an overnight trip. Nabiki was about to break into a run  as soon as the screaming started, but part of her mind caught up to  her and told her that the screams weren't of pleasure, but of horror.   Nabiki quickly snuck back into the house, hoping that she wouldn't  regret what she would see. What she saw made her close the door and  begin laughing. She laughed all the way to her room and, after  making sure that the recording equipment in the guestroom was  working, she lost herself in the laughter. After half an hour of  laughing, Nabiki made her way out of the house because she couldn't  stay there much longer; her side was really starting to hurt. While  Nabiki made her way down the street there was still a lot of  screaming coming from her home. The only thing that differentiated  it from the earlier screaming was that she could her hear father's  voice and wailing intermixed with Genma's.</p><p>The middle  Tendo daughter showed up at her friend's house, still giggling like a  madwoman. This set off a bout of panic in her friend, but after a  few minutes and a few phone calls, Nabiki had her inner circle of  friends howling in laughter too. The main thing that seriously irked  the girls, and would continue to do so for years to come, was the  prevalent though of, 'How come all the cross dressers that come to  Nerima tend to look so much more beautiful then we do?'</p><p>That night,  when Nabiki was walking home, she felt that she should be mad at her  father for cheating on her mother, but she wasn't. Her father  was...moving on, so she was happy for him. She had to admit she  also felt a bit vengeful towards her father for not being a parent  when his daughters needed him most, so maybe this was some form of  divine punishment or something. Whatever it was, she found she  didn't mind at all.</p><p>That night,  Nabiki wasn't sure if she'd be able to get any sleep at home, and  almost went back to sleep at her friend's place for the night. In  the end, though, she decided against it. If Miaka coming over was  going to become a normal occurrence, she would have to get used to  it. That night, she had the most restful night of sleep in her  entire life to that point. All she could remember of the rest of the  night was the men's screaming being drowned out by a musical laughter  that seemed so very familiar.</p><p>The next  morning, Miaka approached Nabiki to work out a deal about hiring the  two men as her personal bodyguards. The moment Miaka had walked in,  Nabiki had put on her business face. Miaka hadn't wasted any time  and made an offer of two hundred thousand yen (around 1,700 US  Dollars).</p><p>Nabiki's  first, and only, thought was, 'Who in their right mind would pay  that much for daddy and Genma? Ranma, yes…Most definitely…but,  those two?'</p><p>Years of  controlling her emotions allowed her to give no indication of her  thoughts and caused Miaka to think Nabiki was hesitant to agree.  This prompted Miaka to raise the pay to three hundred thousand yen  (about two thousand five hundred US Dollars) for each man per week.  Nabiki resisted doing a happy dance right then and there, instead she  let out a sigh, acting like she was reluctant, and agreed, after  stipulating that the job would only be taken if housing was provided.   When Miaka asked why, Nabiki stated that she wanted to see what  living on her own would be like, seeing as she was going to be  heading to college soon, and Genma and her father could do a much  better job if they were closer. Add to that the fact that Akane  could use the opportunity to up her training in taking care of a  home. Miaka thought about it for a second and then agreed to the  terms, leaving just after stating that the contract would be drawn up  and sent to her as soon as possible. Just as Mika was walking out  the door, Nabiki suggested that she should take the two men with her  in order to get them used to their new second home. With that in  mind, Miaka dragged the two unconscious men away.</p><p>A week later,  when Nabiki saw the two men, Genma looked happy while her father's  complexion was a pale white and he was limping. She quickly learned  that Genma could order any and all of the food he wanted and lazed  around all day unless he needed to accompany Miaka somewhere. Genma  was happy and she couldn't have that, so she manipulated Miaka into  hiring Akane on as the men's personal chef. Once she did that, she  congratulated herself on doing her good deed for the year. She had  found her sister, father, and Genma very good paying jobs and the  Tendo home and Dojo were finally financially secure.</p><p>The only bad  thing to come out of all this was that she was forced to cook and  clean for herself... that and she had to hire a maid to clean the  house twice a week.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I like that  plan." Ranma nodded to herself. After a few moments of silence she  started to fidget. Nodoka and Kasumi saw that Ranma was working  herself up to say something else, so were patient and waited until  Ranma was ready.<p>"There…there  was one more thing I wanted to talk to both of you about." Ranma  steadied herself and thought, 'I need to do this! I…I can't  avoid it.'</p><p>Both women sat  there with warm smiles, silently encouraging Ranma to tell them.</p><p>"How…how do  I…I mean, how can…can I…" Ranma stuttered, "…start school  again?"</p><p>Both Nodoka and  Kasumi sat there and blinked twice, completely and utterly unprepared  for Ranma's question.</p><p>Nodoka put her  hand on Ranma's forehead to check her daughter's health. Kasumi  moved her hand to pinch herself, but found Ranma's behind instead,  causing Ranma's head to snap up.</p><p>"GAH!"</p><p>Nodoka looked  at her older daughter with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>Kasumi's only  response was, "This feels much better then pinching myself."</p><p>Nodoka conceded  the point to her daughter. Then spoke to her son-turned-daughter,  "Ranma, are you alright? I didn't expect that you wanted to go  back to school."</p><p>A red-faced  Ranma looked at Kasumi, who looked like all was right with the world  and had no indication of moving her hand anytime soon. "I'm fine.   It's just that…well…"</p><p>Sensing that  this was difficult for Ranma, the two full-time females took a step  away from him and waited.</p><p>"I wanted to,  you know, make myself better." Ranma held her hand up to stop the  other two from speaking. "I know that the two of you think I'm fine  the way I am, but I still want to become a better person. I see  Kasumi trying to improve herself every day and I feel like I'm  cheating someone by not doing anything to improve myself. I know  Kasumi loves the art, but I also know there are other things that she  wishes she could do, like become a nurse or something. I feel that  if I go to school, I can keep those options open for her and me too.  The art will always come before our careers, but that doesn't mean  we can't do something else at the same time. I also don't want  to be seen as just a dumb jock. If Kasumi's husband was seen as  nothing more then a brainless muscle-head I'd feel unworthy of her,  like I insulted her."</p><p>"To be honest  Ranma…" Kasumi began in a soft and caring voice, "I hadn't  really thought that far into the future. It's true that I may want  to have a career in the future, but that won't happen for quite a  few years yet. I'm proud of you for thinking about the future and  that you've begun to plan for it. I'm amazed that the great Ranma  Inoue can admit that he's not perfect." she finished with a wink.</p><p>Ranma let off a  long sigh and smiled, "Even for someone as great as I am, being  compared to you tends shrink their ego."</p><p>"Very true."  Kasumi then developed a seductive smirk, "You know, Ranma, if you  wanted to play 'naughty nurses', we could have gone into town and  found a costume or two."</p><p>"Oh no, if  you two are looking for costumes, I have plenty. You don't have to  go into town." Nodoka happily interjected.</p><p>"Are they  clean, though?" Kasumi asked with an incredulous look.</p><p>"Yes!"  Nodoka looked insulted.</p><p>Ranma shot his  own skeptical look at his mother.</p><p>Nodoka's  expression broke and turned sheepish as she began to blush, "Mostly…"</p><p>Ranma rolled  his eyes, "The last clothing we borrowed from you were… crusty."</p><p>After Ranma  said that, both she and Kasumi shuddered.</p><p>"Anyway,  about going back to school…" Nodoka made a weak attempt to change  the subject.</p><p>Ranma and  Kasumi let their mother off the hook and shifted their thoughts to  more serious matters.</p><p>Once Nodoka got  her blush under control she said, "Although I didn't expect Ranma  to broach the subject, I have talked to my brother about getting the  both of you into school."</p><p>The young  couple nodded and waited for her to continue.</p><p>"He could  easily get the both of you enrolled in the private school near here."</p><p>"Uh…no  offence, mom, but I'm not sure I'd like going to school with a  bunch of rich snobs that act like any of the Kunos." Ranma felt a  lot of discomfort just thinking about going to a school like that.</p><p>"Ranma, not  all wealthy people act like that. I'll admit to there being many  that do, but there are just as many who don't." Nodoka could  easily understand where Ranma's point of view was coming from.</p><p>"Okay."  Ranma could feel relief wash over his entire body.</p><p>"Mother you  said 'both of us'; I've already graduated high school, so why would  I need to go as well?" Kasumi had waited until she was sure that  Ranma had no more questions before voicing her own.</p><p>"Well, Kasumi  you have a choice. You see, the school is made of four main  sections: grade school, middle school, high school and lastly a  college. Students usually work their way through each section until  they graduate college. Normally, a transfer student would transfer  into their current grade level, but it works a bit differently when  entering the college. There are two ways to enter the college:  First, is going through the school from within or, second, to take  the entrance exams like you would for any other college. You could  take the entrance exam to get in or, since you mother was an alumni  and you have very high-standing references, you could retake your  senior year of high school at the private school and move on that  way."</p><p>Kasumi sat  there, silently absorbing what was just told to her.</p><p>"Personally,  I would retake the last year of high school. It would give you a  chance to get used to school again, and you could also stake your  claim on Ranma so that no one will try to form an attraction with him  in school. Oh, and of course you can show him off too."</p><p>Kasumi couldn't  hold back a smile and a giggle, "I'll think about it."</p><p>Ranma laughed  at his mother's reasoning. Truth be told, he knew that it was a  bit selfish but he wanted Kasumi to go with him. He wouldn't tell  Kasumi, though, because this was her decision to make.</p><p>After giving  her children a couple of minutes to think about all that they had  talked about, she made an announcement, "Well, now that all the  important stuff for today has been taken care of, lets eat."</p><p>True to form,  Ranma's stomach quickly growled in agreement.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Author's Notes:  As always, I would like to thank my pre-reader DelShalDar, any  reviewers and anyone who took their time read my story. I'm sorry  that it took me so long to update but I tried to do something that I  couldn't do. I tried to write an internal monologue for Akane and  gave myself writers-block, then real life decided to shove the reason  I don't like Akane or Akane-like characters into my face for a week  and a half. After that, I more or less lost the will to write  outside of my personal journal. On a good note my brother and his  friends took me to my first anime convention (Nan Desu Kan) and  that's why I started writing this story again. One of the scenes in  this story came from a discussion we had. I wanted to try cosplaying  and my brother suggested something simple like a school girl outfit  and somehow it turned into a discussion about school girls and  tentacle monsters. Go figure. Anyways thank you for reading and I  will try to get the next chapter out sooner.<p>Shameless  plug…There's a new site Church of Ranma and Kasumi 2 it is not  there to replace the original CoRK but made to continue a seemingly  dead site (I really hope that it's not dead.). Please go visit it  and help the site grow.</p><p>Reviewer  Responses:</p><p>ninofchaos,  Dumbledork, LoneWolf3CC, Lord of the pit: Thank you and sorry for  taking so long.</p><p>Wonderbee31: I  agree that Kasumi does have the patience to reach Ranma level but it  can't happen to quick so I hope that I can show that.</p><p>DJ Rodriguez:  Thank you and no problem something bad will happen and it will be  next chapter. The NWC will dealt with in due time. (Sinister smile!)</p><p>InsaneClarinetPlayingFFX-2Fan:  I like Kasumi like characters and Ranma is one of my favorite male  characters next to Morita-san from Honey and Clover and Ichigo from  Bleach.</p><p>Shinji the good  sharer: Sorry I have been anti-social later because of some bad  memories being forced in my face again.</p><p>Protector from  Chaos: I thought that Akane's cooking could eat through iron? J  Thank You.</p><p>Goldfighter:  I'm glad you think so and I will update as soon as I can.</p><p>JonnhyG: I  thought the orgasm scene was funny but oh well. Conflict will come  in the next chapter. The last chapter this one and the next were  originally one chapter. I tried to write a bit of conflict into this  chapter but it kinda threw off the stuff I had planned for the rest  of the story so I decided to stay with this and I do agree that I  need some more conflict in the story but it would quite fit into this  chapter.</p><p>SSJGuyver: I  don't know if it could be anywhere near Aijou &amp; Aitou but I am  very happy that you think so.</p><p>James Axelrad:  Thank you for the suggestion; it has given me a couple of ideas.</p><p>Shadow.:  Honestly I didn't plan for Kasumi to become a little perverted it  just kanda worked out that way. I guess I like that idea cause in  another free write I started Kasumi was a bit perverted in that story  too.</p><p>Nonengel:  Kasumi style will get better right now I'm just covering the basic  stuff.</p><p>Lerris:  Originally this was to be an aghast story where Ranma snapped and  Genma ended up a bloody mess with his own muscle ripped out hanging  in front of him, but I didn't like that so I did a complete 180 and  it became a fluffy story.</p><p>Martrex: I  think those are excellent suggestions, but I think you might like  what I have planned.</p><p>Hiryo: Your  question should be answer when Happosai shows up, until then my lips  are sealed. :p Your C2 community does provide a good  distraction/break.</p><p>SonPanSatan:  Nodoka only thought about waiting for Soun to move on and didn't  think about giving it to Nabiki. She was hoping for him to become  the man he was before Kimiko past away. I find my Akane from real  life experience I saw the results of some abusive bh and what she  did to one of my family. I will not have that same thing happen to  one of my favorite male leads.</p><p>Anyways,  as always, you can leave a review or e-mail me a comment at:</p><p>tsunami(underscore)saotome(at)yahoo(dot)com</p><p>I  would like to thank everyone you took the time to review my story  even those who took the time to read it. I hope hear from everyone  again and hopefully even more people.</p>
