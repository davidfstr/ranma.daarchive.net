</div>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranme 1/2 and am doing this for the fun of it.<p>Author's  Notes: I would like to thank my pre-readers DelShalDar (also his wife),  and Drkjester for taking the time to proof read and give me input for  this chapter. Also I used DelShalDar paragraph to describe the front of  Nodoka's home because it was better than mine. Reviewer's responses are  on the bottom.</p><p>Only you...</p><p>By TsunamiSaotome</p><p>The trio  had been walking away from the Tendo household for a few minutes, and  Nodoka was focused on getting her family to their new home. Ranma and  Kasumi were still holding hands, and were blushing heavily because of  it. Each of their thoughts centered on how good it felt to hold the  others' hand. Kasumi and Ranma were mindlessly following Nodoka, until  Ranma was pulled from his Kasumi induced haze by something bouncing off  his leg. Looking down he noticed a ball, picked it up, and glanced  around, he noticed a young girl running towards him. Kneeling down, he  smiled as he handed the ball to her. The girl blushed as she took the  ball, mumbled her thanks, then ran back to her friends. Ranma glanced  around and noticed that they were in a park that was in the opposite  direction of the Saotome estate.</p><p>"Mom?" Ranma called out to his mother, who had not noticed that her two companions had stopped.</p><p>"Yes?"  Nodoka answered, turned around, only to be surprised as to how far she  was from her son, and his love interest. Ranma briefly tightened his  grip on Kasumi's hand as they walked the distance to his mother.</p><p>"Isn't  the house in the other direction?" Ranma asked. Then he watched as a  torrent of emotions clouded her eyes. Despair. Fear. Worthlessness.  Shattered Love.</p><p>"We're going to a place that I haven't visited in  the last twenty years. Genma doesn't know about it. I can't be near  him. I don't want to be near him. I have to get away from him." When  Nodoka finished, she was no longer the proud mother Ranma knew. This  person was a frightened and lonely women that had lost everything.</p><p>Ranma  started to move to comfort his mother. He felt Kasumi release his hand,  and saw she had the same idea as he did. He watched Kasumi glide over  to the older woman, and encircled her in a fierce, but tender embrace.</p><p>Kasumi  watched the emotions play across Nodoka's face. Her thoughts were that  no woman should ever feel the way Ranma's mother was now. Kasumi  watched as Nodoka's emotions started to spiral out of control again and  figured that the woman's fragile facade was about to fall apart, and  she would break down again. Releasing Ranma's hand, she moved to  tightly embrace the distraught woman. Kasumi held Ranma's mother, while  Nodoka struggled to hold in tears that tried to fall. After a few tense  moments Kasumi leaned in towards Nodoka's ear, and whispered.</p><p>"Ranma and I will always be with you, and love you...mother."</p><p>Nodoka  started to relax, and began to pull away. When she was far enough, she  grabbed and held one of Kasumi's hands in both of hers. In a warm and  comforting voice said, "Thank You."</p><p>Ranma watched as one woman he  loved comforted another that he loved, and smiled. He frowned as he  though over his mother's words. He figured that his mother was not yet  ready to confront his fa-... no, Genma. He also knew that the three of  them did not want to deal with anyone in Nerima yet. If they wanted to  avoid anybody from Nerima, Genma wasn't really much of an issue; it was  Nabiki who was the problem. Ranma started to curse himself, since he  found himself at a loss as to how to deal with Nabiki.</p><p>"-ma, Ranma..."</p><p>Shaking himself out of his thoughts, he turned to Kasumi, as she had been calling him.</p><p>"Huh? Sorry. Wha?"</p><p>Kasumi's  face was neutral, no trace of her usual smile could be seen. While she  was holding Nodoka, she had felt a sense of frustration coming from  Ranma. She had called out to him, at first he didn't respond, but when  he had finally looked up and responded, she saw his face contorted in  seriousness and concentration.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Kasumi asked in a calm voice mixed with a bit of concern.</p><p>"Noth-..."  Ranma had started to automatically respond, but stopped himself.  'Kasumi and mom are much smarter then I am. Maybe be they know  something that could help.' with a sigh Ranma swallowed his pride, and  voiced his thoughts, "Genma isn't the one we need to worry about. It's  Nabiki. She could use her people and connections to find us wherever we  go, and quickly too, I think."</p><p>"I think I know a way." Nodoka spoke. By now she had released herself from Kasumi, and started to walk away again.</p><p>Deciding  to trust her, Ranma took Kasumi's hand again, and started to follow his  mother. The pair followed her until they had reached the business  district, and she stopped at a simple looking two story building. There  was nothing distinguishing about the building, it was an off-white  building with windows, and a white door. Nodoka motioned for the two to  follow, and walked inside. The room as simple as the outside of the  building. To both sides of the entrance there was a couch, and above  each couch was a painting of a forest. Near the far wall in front of  them was a receptionist sitting a wood desk busy on the phone. The  three of them stopped in front of the lone desk, and waited for its  occupant to get off the phone.</p><p>"What can I do for you Inoue-san?" the young lady asked after she hung up the phone.</p><p>"We need some transportation, but I know that we are going to be followed." Nodoka replied.</p><p>"I see. Who do you think will be following you?"</p><p>"Nabiki Tendo."</p><p>"Hmm...  very well. I will tell the others, and we will handle it." The girl  calmly replied back, "So where would you like to go to today?"</p><p>"My mother's summer estate."</p><p>"Alright,  if you could wait about fifteen minutes your car will be ready." with  that said the young secretary smiled and left the room.</p><p>Having a  moment to themselves, Nodoka turned to observe the other two that came  with her. Kasumi stood there as serene as ever; simply, content to be  by Ranma's side. Ranma on the other hand was fidgeting, and looked like  he was about to say something.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Nodoka gentle prodded.</p><p>Ranma who was holding his question since the three entered the building blurted out his question, "What is this place?"</p><p>"It's a place for people to travel discreetly, with fewer chances of being followed; all we have to do is pay a fee."</p><p>"So this could keep Nabiki from following us?" Ranma questioned.</p><p>"Yes, at least for a while."</p><p>With  Ranma's curiosity satisfied. The three settled into a comforting  silence, as they waited for the young receptionist to return.</p><p>"Ms.  Inoue, your car is ready. Please follow me." the young receptionist  said as she entered the room. The three followed the girl as she led  them to a non-descript black luxury car. She opened the door and held  it for her three customers.</p><p>"Thank you." Nodoka replied with a  slight bow at the young girl. She, Ranma, and Kasumi then entered the  car, each with a slight bow towards the girl as they entered.</p><p>"You're welcome, and please have a safe trip." with that said the young girl closed the door to the car and left.</p><p>Once  the three passengers were settled, the car started up, and was driven  through a series of man-made tunnels, and eventually exiting onto a  road well outside of Nerima.</p><p>The three of them had remained silent up to this point, until Kasumi asked, "Where are we going?"</p><p>"We are going to my mother's home." Nodoka softly replied.</p><p>"So does that mean I'll get to meet my grandmother?" Ranma spoke with an excited voice.</p><p>With a fallen face Ranma's mother replied, "No... Mom... your grandmother died about four years ago."</p><p>"I'm so-sorry." Ranma said, managing to somehow sound meek and saddened at the same time.</p><p>Kasumi  sensed that the comfortable silence they had shared a few moments ago  had now become disheartening. She felt it was her fault that everyone  had become miserable, so she frantically searched for anything to  distract the other two from thinking about Nodoka's mother. In the end  she couldn't think of anything, so she voiced the first thought that  had entered her mind.</p><p>"Why did that girl refer to you as Ms. Inoue earlier?"</p><p>Nodoka  sat there pondering how to answer Kasumi's question. After a few  moments she decided that her son and his almost girlfriend deserved an  honest answer.</p><p>"It is my maiden name. My name before I married that... thing."</p><p>When  Nodoka started to speak about her ex-husband, Kasumi started to panic,  and was about to change the subject again. That was until Nodoka's soft  hands were placed over hers, and Nodoka continued, "Please don't, both  of you need, and deserve, to hear this."</p><p>After hearing Nodoka speak, Kasumi relented and relaxed, waiting for Nodoka to continue.</p><p>"You  see, when I first started dating Genma, my family didn't approve of  him. They voiced their opinions about him to me, but didn't really do  anything to stop me from seeing him. I think they figured it was a  phase or something. I used to get into huge arguments with anyone in my  family about Genma. Everyone used to tell me about the things Genma had  done, and had even shown me proof of some of what he had done. I guess  those who said love was blind were talking about people like me..."  Nodoka paused with a humorless chuckle, "As I got closer and closer to  Genma, my family was becoming colder and more distant towards me. I  think watching Genma and I becoming closer finally became too much for  my father to watch, because that day he and I got into an explosive  argument that ended up with me eloping with Genma. When I had calmed  down, I called home to apologize to father, only to find out that I had  been banished from the clan. When I heard that, I had nothing else to  do except follow Genma. A year and a half after that, you were born,  and for our first five or six years of marriage, Genma was the ideal  husband. He was always going on training trips, but had always sent or  brought home money for us. I, being the obedient house wife that I was,  never questioned how he got the money, but eventually we managed to  save enough to buy the Saotome estate. For those few precious years we  lived together as a family; until, on the saddest day of my life, you  left on that ill-fated training trip. I never agreed to that stupid  seppuku contract, but it was all that I had left of you; the only  reminder that you would come back to me, so I kept it. I spent the next  two weeks crying and breaking down at the sight, or thought, of  anything that reminded me of you two. It was at the end of the second  week that I found myself staring at my sister when I opened the front  door. As it had been for the last two weeks, my emotions overwhelmed  me, and I grabbed and held onto my sister and cried. My sister kept  holding me, until I had calmed down and asked her how she knew I was  here. She told me that father had found where I lived, but never had he  courage to come see me. Suddenly, she asked me to go with her and  started to drag me toward her car. When I asked why, she told me that  our parents were dieing. It turns out that both your grandparents had  been very ill for the last three years, and they wanted to see me  before they passed on. My sister rushed me to the hospital, and I got  one of the biggest surprises of my life. In that hospital bed was my  father, once a strong and powerful man, was a withered husk. I  surprised myself by crying for him. I had shed so many tears over the  last few weeks that I thought I didn't have any more that could fall.  As I sat there weeping my heart out, I felt his weakened hand cup my  face. He told me that his biggest regret was kicking me out of the  clan, and that he was never going to meet his grandchild. His last act  as the head of the clan was to take me back into it. He then asked me  to speak to my mother. When I spoke to her, she told me that she  regretted not being a better mother; she also admitted that she had  left me a bit of land and a trust fund. After that I spent the next two  days talking to them about you; until, they died minutes apart from  each other. I never tried to find out how much was in the trust fund,  nor have I visited my mother's summer home in the last twenty years."  When Nodoka finished, her voice was filled with pride as she remembered  her parents and sadness as she remembered the day her parents left her.</p><p>"So,  since you haven't been to the place for so long, we don't have to clean  the place do we?" Ranma's foot-in-the-mouth disease questioned</p><p>Kasumi  so wanted to swat Ranma on the back of the head. Her hands were slowly  being raised, and her right eye had a bit of a tick in it. Nodoka saw  this and held back a chuckle. She decided not to say anything in order  to see where this would lead. Kasumi was in a bit of a dilemma, she  wanted to swat Ranma on the back of the head for his remark, but, at  the same time, didn't really want to hit him because he received enough  of that kind of attention back in Nerima. So coming to a decision about  her predicament, she ended up glaring at Ranma, although coming from  Kasumi it looked like an almost frown and slightly narrowed eyes, and  flicked him on his nose. Ranma was extremely surprised by Kasumi's  actions and looked at her only to start cringing due to the look he was  receiving. Ranma averted his eyes downward to avoid Kasumi's gaze, but  that only caused him to start looking at the tip of his nose because of  the slight tingling sensation left by her touch. The sight of her son  staring crossed eyed it the tip of his nose was too much for her and  caused to start to laugh. It was the first time in nearly a decade and  a half that she had actually laughed. It was the first time in that  decade and a half that she felt she was even able to laugh; the first  time she felt whole, and the first time she felt that she, her son, and  her probable daughter-in-law were a family. Distracted by Nodoka's  laughter Kasumi looked away from Ranma, who she was still a bit cross  with thanks to his insensitive question, to Nodoka. She briefly  wondered if the woman had finally lost it, if all the recent events and  stress had finally caused Nodoka's mind to break. That was until her  head turned to what Nodoka was looking at. Kasumi watched a cross-eyed  Ranma twitch his nose in an incredibly cute way, and nearly broke out  laughing herself. She managed to hold her laughter in, as she dug  through her things, only letting out a small adorable snort, which only  served to fuel Nodoka's laughter. When she found what she was looking  for, she stopped digging, pulled out a small camera, steadied herself,  and took a picture. With her task done, she no longer needed to hold  herself back, and collapsed further back into her seat and copied  Nodoka's actions. Ranma, finally drawn away from his self inspection,  noticed that his two traveling companions were laughing. His face  twisted in confusion as he tried to figure out what was wrong with  them. That was, at least, until Kasumi lifted up the camera and snapped  off another shot. That just caused Ranma to pout. This brought about  another flash from Kasumi's camera. Ranma, fed up with the way the  other two women were acting, turned to the window, crossed his arms,  and started to sulk. After a few more minutes of laughing and giggling,  both Nodoka and Kasumi calmed down enough to try to stop Ranma from  brooding.</p><p>"We're sorry Ranma." Kasumi said with a smile, still trying to hold back a few giggles that had yet to escape.</p><p>Ranma looked at her, his eyes narrowed defiantly, arms still crossed, and a frown across his lips.</p><p>"Please  don't be mad, but you looked so cute and we couldn't help it." Kasumi  spoke with the near-infectious smile still plastered on her face.</p><p>Kasumi  saw Ranma's frown falter and decided to go for broke. Ranma nearly  screamed in terror as Ranma saw Kasumi use the one technique that he  could never find a counter to, the one that he had always lost to, the  dreaded, the should-be-forbidden, the sad puppy-dog eyes. That  technique alone, on any other girl, would be able to crumble his  resolve, but that look, along with Kasumi's goddess like beauty, caused  his resolve to be crushed, then disintegrated, then sealed in a  titanium-alloy container and buried hundreds of kilometers under mount  Fuji.</p><p>"Please  don't be mad; I'll make you dinner, and you can have anything you want  for desert." Kasumi continued with her cuteness assault on Ranma.</p><p>Ranma  slumped and dejectedly said, "Fine, but you better make lots of food!  And for dessert I want a mountain of ice cream with your cherry on  top!" Absently, another part of Ranma's mind wondered why he had asked  Kasumi for ice cream. That was until his memories of the end of his  last ice cream binge surfaced in his mind. His memories of taking that  wonderful cherry into her mouth. (Ranma a girl at the time.) Suckling  it. Rolling it on her tongue. Sucking on it, and milking it for every  drop of its heavenly juices. Then devouring it, and savoring it like it  was a piece of ambrosia from the gods themselves. God, Kasumi's things  taste so good if she made it for me it would be so so… At this point  that little part of Ranma's mind went blank because it couldn't find a  word to Kasumi's cherry.</p><p>"Ok!" Kasumi's mouth responded before  her brain had a chance to decipher and inform her of Ranma's request.  Eventually her mind figured out what Ranma said he wanted, and her  internal voice let out a 'O-OO-OH M-MM-MMMY'. After she realized what  Ranma had asked, her entire body started to do a reasonable impression  of Ranma-chan's fiery red hair.</p><p>Nodoka sat  there, happily watching the other two interact. That was, at least,  until Ranma's bold request. After his request she sat there in  open-mouthed shock, but an old sub-routine jump-started her mind again.</p><p>'GRANDCHILDREN!'</p><p>Nodoka  barely resisted the urge to break out her "I'm going to be a  grandmother" fans and do her happy dance. Instead she chose to watch  Ranma, who was currently inching closer and closer to Kasumi, asking  her if she was ok. It was then that Nodoka realized Ranma had simply  miss-worded his request. A part of her was disappointed, but the rest  of her decided to laugh, which is also what she did on the outside.  Ranma sat, confused again, but this time decided to ask what he'd done.</p><p>"Errr... mom, what's so funny this time?" Ranma asked with a thoroughly confused look on his face.</p><p>After  succeeding in controlling her laughter, Nodoka decided to answer her  son. "Well, you see Ranma, what you asked of Kasumi was  mmmmpppphhhmpph..." Nodoka couldn't quite finish due to the strategic  placement of Kasumi's hand which was now covering her mouth. Ranma,  meanwhile, became more confused at Kasumi's actions. Ranma's mother,  figuring that Kasumi didn't want Ranma to know, shut her mouth and  nodded to the young woman. Sighing in relief, Kasumi released Nodoka  and sat back down. Somehow knowing that he wouldn't receive any answers  from his mother, Ranma decided to voice his question to Kasumi. This  only served to embarrass the young woman even more and rekindle  Nodoka's mirth. Suffice to say, the rest of the car ride was nearly  hellish for Kasumi because Ranma, for some odd or stubborn reason, kept  trying to find out what kept causing his mother to break out in fits of  laughter. This caused Nodoka to start laughing again, which only  refreshed Kasumi's embarrassment.</p><p>When they arrived at the house  Kasumi refused to leave the car. Much to the amusement of Ranma and  Nodoka, Kasumi had duplicated Ranma's earlier pose, and was moping in  the car. Now it was Ranma who was pleading with Kasumi.</p><p>"I'm sorry." Ranma pleaded, "Please come out of the car. Pleeeeease!" Kasumi just turned away from him.</p><p>Nodoka,  meanwhile, just stood outside of the car and was highly entertained as  she watched the two interact. 'I hope they forget that I was the one  who started all of this.'</p><p>Ranma, on the other hand, had succeeded  in gaining Kasumi's attention again. "I'll be good, so please don't be  mad at me." Ranma then proceeded to imitate Kasumi and do his own  version of sad puppy dog eyes, but since he was in his guy form at the  time, it wasn't as effective so all he ended up doing was look goofy.  Kasumi couldn't help smiling as she looked at Ranma. Seeing his little  plan succeed, Ranma could help but release a bit of a smirk.</p><p>After seeing his smirk, Kasumi rolled her eyes and spoke sarcastically, "Ranma your hopeless!"</p><p>"Hey,  I have lots of hopes!" said Ranma, feeling insulted, "Like  err...umm...like...I hope we don't have to clean the place up!" Oddly,  Ranma felt proud of his answer, and stood with his arms crossed,  nodding in a sage-like manner.</p><p>Kasumi had fought, and valiantly won,  against face-faulting at Ranma statement, simply got out of the car,  flicked Ranma on the nose, began ignoring him and walked towards  Nodoka. Ranma looked at his nose, where Kasumi had flicked him, and  then at Kasumi's back as she was walking away from him. He shivered a  bit at the coldness suddenly being displayed to him by Kasumi, of all  people. He couldn't help but shudder as he asked, "What'd I do?"</p><p>Nodoka  sensed that the little confrontation was over and, being the loving  mother she wanted to become, added one last barb. "Now, if you two are  done flirting with each other, I would like to go inside."</p><p>The  two blushed. Ranma started sputtering, trying to deny that he and  Kasumi were flirting. But he failed miserably thanks to the growing  blush dancing across his cheeks. Although, more than likely, the main  reason that he couldn't deny flirting with Kasumi was because his mind  couldn't complete a coherent thought at the moment. Kasumi had frozen  in mid step, her mouth was agape, her eyes were as big as Ranma's ego,  and the rest of her face was covered in a heavy blush.</p><p>For a  brief moment Nodoka wondered if Kasumi would fall over and stay in the  same pose, if she were to go over and give her a gentle nudge. She  waited a few more moments, and only Nodoka would know whether she was  waiting for one of them to answer, or she just wanted to embarrass them  for a bit longer.</p><p>"And to answer your question Ranma, we don't  need to clean the place up because my brother and sister stay here from  time to time and keep the place clean. Oh, and please don't forget to  bring in the backpacks when you come inside." With that said, Ranma's  mother entered their new home, leaving a still stammering Ranma and  frozen Kasumi outside.</p><p>There wasn't anything special about the  front of the house, though the house itself looked fairly modern. A  stone wall, about a meter and a half tall, surrounded the property. A  doorway, built into the wall to allow entry into the estate, was about  a meter wide and could be sealed with its corresponding metal gate. A  stone pathway leading to the entrance of the house could be seen  through the open doorway. The entrance to the house was blocked by an  off-white wooden door, and on either side of the door was a sliding  glass window. Another window had been placed above the doorway, and  stretched the entire length of both the doorway and the windows to  either side. In front of the smaller windows there were many different  colored rose bushes planted. The main pathway seemed to have spawned  two dirt paths, running perpendicular to the stone pathway and parallel  to the rose bushes, toward the back of the house. All in all, it was a  simple and comfortable looking house.</p><p>By the time Nodoka had  entered the house, Ranma and Kasumi had recovered somewhat, though they  still had healthy blushes caressing their cheeks. Having done as his  mother asked, Ranma had gathered his and Kasumi's backpacks and  followed Kasumi into the house. When they entered the house they found  themselves in a small living room. To the right was a fire place, ahead  of them was a set of stairs running parallel to the door, and a hallway  could be seen on the far left corner of the room. Spotting Nodoka as  she entered the hallway, Ranma and Kasumi took off their shoes and  followed. In the hallway the first door to their left was a restroom,  directly across from that door, to their right, was the dining room, in  front of them was a larger living room. The living room was connected  to the kitchen, which also connected to the dining room.</p><p>"Alright,  let me start dinner, and you two go get settled in one of the bedrooms  up stairs. One of the room should be mine, so pick one of the other  five rooms." Nodoka nodded to herself and walked towards the kitchen.</p><p>Both  Ranma and Kasumi were a bit confused. They thought that Nodoka had not  come to this place in twenty years, but it looked like she knew exactly  where everything was in the kitchen, and already had a room in their  new home. Ranma, never one to be able to hold his tongue, asked the  question that was on both of their minds, "Uhh... mom? If you haven't  been here in so long, why do you know where everything is in the  kitchen? And why do you already have your own room?"</p><p>Nodoka  didn't even pause in preparing dinner as she began to answer, "That  would be your uncle's fault. He remodeled the house about three years  ago. He told me that, since the house was to be mine, he'd had one of  the bedrooms rebuilt just for me. And the kitchen was designed to look  exactly like the one at..." Nodoka briefly paused to reconsider her  wording, "Genma's home."</p><p>When Ranma heard the name of the man who  had fathered him, he automatically moved to comfort his mother. To his  surprise, other then a slight wavering of the happiness in his mother's  eyes, his mother remained unruffled and cheerful. Nodoka saw her son  moving to comfort her and smiled at him, which stopped him from moving.  "Please go pick a room and get settled. I'll call you down for dinner  as soon as it's ready."</p><p>Ranma nodded to his mother. He unconsciously grasped Kasumi's hand and dragged her up the stairs.</p><p>The  second floor of the house was one long hallway, with three rooms on  either side of it, and a furo at the end of the hall. The first door to  the right had a name plate on it, with little deformed chibi kendo  girls surrounding the name, which read: "Doka-chan's Room".</p><p>"Uh... I think that's mom's room." Ranma responded to the overly cute name plate.</p><p>"I  think you're right." Kasumi said as she moved to the room farthest down  the hall on the right side of the hall. "Is it alright if I take this  room, Ranma?"</p><p>"Sure, if you want." Ranma spoke as he was moving to claim the room between his mother and his love interest.</p><p>When  Ranma entered the room, he looked around in slight awe. There was a bed  to the side, on the other side of the bed was a computer, and in the  wall across from the computer was a closet. The room wasn't anything  special, but it was more then Ranma ever had in his entire chaotic  life. Ranma unpacked his backpack and tried to decorate his room, but  found he just didn't have enough stuff. When he stepped back to examine  the room, it seemed less plain and more like it was truly his room. He  decided to leave it for now and check on his housemates. As soon as he  opened the door, he felt someone rapping on his forehead.</p><p>"Gah!" was Ranma's response along with a blush.</p><p>Kasumi  snapped out of the slight daze at the sound of Ranma's voice, and  promptly blushed as she realized what she had done. "Sorry!" she  quickly apologized.</p><p>"I-It's alright Kasumi..." Ranma said a bit flustered, "So, uh, what can I do for you?"</p><p>After calming down a bit, she answered, "I was hoping you were done so we could go help yo- I mean uh.. mother with dinner."</p><p>"Sure." with that, the two headed down stairs to the kitchen.</p><p>As  it turned out, their help was not really needed as Nodoka was nearly  finished. So the two merely set the table and watched Nodoka as she  worked. Soon enough dinner was being enjoyed by the three of them. The  three spoke of little inane things, along with the two women  admonishing, and trying to correct, Ranma's eating habits. Oh, and, in  case any of you were wondering, Ranma didn't get his ice cream. When  dinner ended Ranma asked for the other two to wait.</p><p>"Well... Uh... I was hoping that we could do something together later..." Ranma hesitantly asked.</p><p>"Like what Ranma?" Kasumi questioned.</p><p>"I  was thinking, you know, that we could like... have a uh.. like,  sleepover kind of thing." without waiting for an answer, Ranma then  began to give his reasons, "Because I don't know very much about you  two. I mean, I know some stuff... like, Kasumi cleans really good, and  is nice. Then mom uh..." Ranma paused and looked at Kasumi with his  face reddening, "wants-lots-of-grandchildren, and wears lots of  kimonos... But... I kind of want to learn more. Also, if we do become a  family, I think we should know more about each other..."</p><p>Kasumi  sat motionless, still stuck on the implications of Ranma's words.  Nodoka, on the other hand, thought that it was a marvelous idea and had  moved off into one of the other rooms, busily rummaging for things that  could be used for their little slumber party. When she returned, she  dumped a pile of pillows and two sleeping bags at the feet of the still  motionless Kasumi. Ranma noticed that one of the sleeping bags was  larger then the other, but didn't think anything of it.</p><p>"Let me go grab some blankets from my room since there are only two sleeping bags."</p><p>Ranma  was about to leave when his mother spoke, "Oh no, you don't need to. I  got the large bag for the two of you. I figure that you two could work  on giving me some grandchildren later."</p><p>'Oh My!' was the only  thought going through the minds of the two youths. Well... there were  some mental images, but it would be quite inappropriate to describe  them.</p><p>"MOOOOOOOOM!" Ranma and Kasumi screamed simultaneously.</p><p>"What?" Nodoka said, sounding like there was absolutely nothing wrong with her suggestion.</p><p>"How could you suggest that!" Kasumi started to rant.</p><p>"We can't have children yet..." Ranma picked up.</p><p>"...We're too young!" Kasumi ended the thought.</p><p>"You're the adult here..." Ranma started a new sentence.</p><p>"...aren't you supposed to..." Kasumi said, understanding where Ranma was going.</p><p>"...be the one telling..." Ranma spoke, glad Kasumi was backing him.</p><p>"...Telling us not to..." Kasumi kept going, happy that she and Ranma were thinking the same thoughts.</p><p>"...Rush things?" Ranma finished.</p><p>"It  is obvious to me that you two care for each other, and the sooner you  two start, the better chance I have of spoiling more grandchildren."  Nodoka replied, a bit disoriented from moving her head from side to  side while listing to her son and most likely future-daughter-in-law's  rant.</p><p>"Mom, I've already told you that I lo-care..." Ranma  glanced over at Kasumi at his near slip-up, but couldn't really tell if  she reacted, mainly because they were both still crimson, "for her. For  the first time in my entire life I have a chance to be part of  something special. I want to take my time and work toward something  that only seems possible in fairytales, and make it become real."</p><p>Kasumi  entire being was radiating joy. For the first time since her mother's  death she felt not like a servant or slave, but a woman. For the first  time she could remember a man saw her, not as a cook, housekeeper, or  the perfect wife, but as a possible soul mate and/or lover. Kasumi  stood up, and with slow, deliberate steps, she walked over to Ranma and  enveloped him in a soulful embrace. When Ranma had held Kasumi in his  arms the past, all their problems, and the future all faded away  leaving only the two of them. Kasumi put her mouth as close to Ranma's  ear as she could and whispered, "Thank you."</p><p>Kasumi rested her  head on Ranma's shoulder and molded herself to him. For a moment, or  maybe an eternity, the two relish in the shared warmth that was  produced when they embraced each other. This further reinforced the  idea that what they shared could truly become special.</p><p>Their  moment was broken when Nodoka could no longer hold herself back, and  let out a snuffle. The young couple, realizing they weren't alone,  quickly separated with their eyes set to the floor, their faces set  aflame yet again. Nodoka took this moment to regain her composure  again, and released a dramatically long, over-drawn-out sigh.</p><p>"Oh,  alright, but I'm keeping the big bag out here. At the rate you two are  going, you'll most likely need it." Nodoka dramatically stated. She  then walked to the doorway, reached behind the wall, and pulled out a  third sleeping bag.</p><p>After seeing his mother grab the bag so  quickly, Ranma to groaned and said, "Why do I get the feeling Kasumi  and I are being manipulated towards your grand scheme of getting  grandchildren."</p><p>"I know nothing of this great conspiracy you  speak of, son." Nodoka said in an exaggeratedly innocent voice. When  Ranma looked over at his mother, she had a big doe-eyed expression  plastered on her face. Ranma also could have sworn that he saw a golden  halo hovering above his mother's head, along with a set of pearl white  wings growing out of her back. Ranma now knew for certain that he had  been tricked, but for some odd reason he wouldn't have it any other way.</p><p>Kasumi  had, long ago, figured that Nodoka was up to something and easily found  she didn't mind. She also found that she felt, as Ranma did, that she  wouldn't have it any other way. She just sat there quietly and watched  mother and son interact, hoping she wouldn't become the target of  Nodoka's sense of humor.</p><p>In a matter of minutes everything had  settled down and the three started to talk about their past experiences  and feelings. Of course, there were things that each person was not yet  ready to share, but that still left many, many things that were spoken  about. The three of them talked and listened to each other's stories  long into the night, only stopping when exhaustion overtook them.</p><p>Nodoka  looked at Ranma and Kasumi as she adjusted their sleeping bags. They  looked so peaceful. Nodoka kissed each of them on the forehead and bid  them a silent good night. After getting into her own sleeping bag, she  considered her son and daughter. Yes, she now thought of Kasumi as her  own daughter, even if Kasumi decided not to marry Ranma for some  reason, she would still consider Kasumi her daughter. As Nodoka fell  asleep she vowed to herself that she would do anything and everything  in her power to protect her family.</p><p>Nodoka's Dream-</p><p>Nodoka  was sitting on a park bench as she watched her two grandchildren play.  Both children were about four or five years old. The young boy had  chestnut-brown hair and light blue eyes. He was wearing an outfit which  was an exact match to his father's, a red Chinese shirt, black kung-fu  pants and black kung-fu slippers. The young girl had black hair and  misty blue-gray eyes. She was wearing a Mandarin Blouse with an  Embroidered Phoenix on it and Fang Yin Satin Pants. The two of them  were on the swing set, competing to see who could swing the highest.  Then, suddenly, Nodoka was blinded by a flash of light.</p><p>BOOM!-</p><p>"GRANDMA!" the two young children screamed.</p><p>Nodoka shook the spots from her vision and looked on in horror at the scene in front of her.</p><p>'NO...'</p><p>There was a man chasing after her two grandchildren; while at the same time, they were running towards her.</p><p>'NO...'</p><p>The man was wearing a white gi on his overweight body, a bandana over his bald head and a pair of glasses over his beady eyes.</p><p>'NO...'</p><p>The man was...</p><p>'NO...'</p><p>The man was...</p><p>'NO...'</p><p>...her husband Genma.</p><p>'NO!'</p><p>"MOVE WOMAN!" Genma spoke in a thunderous voice.</p><p>"NO! I WILL NOT!" retorted Nodoka, emphatically.</p><p>"THOSE TWO WILL BECOME WHAT THAT WEAK SON OF YOURS FAILED TO BE! THEY WILL BECOME THE PERFECT MARTIAL ARTISTS!" Genma bellowed.</p><p>"Run! Please, go to your parents!" Nodoka whispered to the two children behind her.</p><p>"But..." the young boy tried to interrupt.</p><p>"Please!  Your parents and I would be very sad if something were to happen to you  two." Nodoka looked at the two children with pleading eyes.</p><p>The  two young children looked ready to defy her, but relented due to the  look they were receiving. But, finally, the children nodded. They took  hold of each other's hands and started to run.</p><p>Nodoka unsheathed her katana and turned to regard Genma.</p><p>"HA HAHAHAHAHAHA!" came the maniacal laughter of Genma, "SO THE WEAK PIECE OF TRASH THINKS SHE CAN STOP ME!"</p><p>Nodoka just narrowed her eyes and shifted into a defensive stance.</p><p>"YOU  COULDN'T STOP ME BEFORE..." Genma took a step with each word he spoke,  "YOU DID NOTHING TO STOP ME FROM TORTURING YOUR SON, SO WHY SHOULD IT  BE ANY DIFFERENT WITH THOSE TWO!"</p><p>By then, Genma had reached  Nodoka, and he looked at her with contempt, then back-handed her in the  face. The blow was strong enough to loosen a couple of her teeth and  knock her back about two meters. Nodoka got to her feet as quickly as  she could, but still wobbled from the blow.</p><p>"I-I'LL PROTECT MY FAMILY!" blood flew from her mouth as Nodoka screamed at him.</p><p>"YOU  ARE STUPID, WEAK, AND USELESS. YOU HAD NEVER PROTECTED YOUR SON, SO WHY  DO YOU THINK YOU CAN YOU START NOW!" Genma sneered at the woman while  taking another step toward his wife with each word.</p><p>Nodoka now was faltering and retreating with each step the man took.</p><p>"DID  YOU KNOW THAT THE SON YOU LOVE SO MUCH SPENT MONTHS CALLING OUT FOR  YOU, CRYING FOR YOU, BEGGING FOR YOU TO COME HELP HIM AND YET YOU DID  NOTHING! YOUR SON KNOWS NOTHING MORE THEN BITTERNESS AND HATE. THE SON  YOU LOVE SO MUCH... HATES YOU!" Genma spat out.</p><p>Nodoka reeled at  Genma's words and nearly stumbled. Self-pity and doubt overwhelmed her  as she stood there, unable to refute Genma's words.</p><p>"I am here now."</p><p>"I will never leave you."</p><p>"I love you."</p><p>"No matter what, I will always be your son."</p><p>Ranma's voice echoed through her mind as she remembered the words he'd said to comfort her.</p><p>"Ranma and I will always be with you, and love you...mother."</p><p>Kasumi's voice echoed alongside Ranma's, as both voices sought to comfort and give strength to Nodoka.</p><p>"HAHAHAHAHA!" Genma cackled again, "OH, SO THE LITTLE WHORE STILL HAS A BIT OF SPRIT LEFT IN HER!"</p><p>Nodoka rose back up to her full height and took an offensive stance with her sword.</p><p>"WASTE LIKE YOU DOESN'T DESERVE TO LIVE!" roared Genma as he reared his arm back, ready to cave in Nodoka's skull.</p><p>As  Genma's arm came forward, there was no sound or epic struggle. Instead,  there was a simple flick of Nodoka's wrist, and then it was over.</p><p>THUMP-</p><p>That  was the only sound that was heard. That was the sound of Genma's  headless body crashing to the ground. Nodoka looked at Genma's head as  it rolled to a stop at her feet and made one last declaration before  following her two grandchildren.</p><p>"I WILL do anything and everything to protect my family!"</p><p>Author's  Notes: I blame DelShalDar for the scene with Ranma's mind and the  cherry. He wanted to know what was going through Ranma's mind, and you  read what I think was going through his mind. (smiley face (stupid  formatting they took away my smiley face.))</p><p>Reviewers Responses:</p><p>Chapter  one may seem to have been rushed, but I kind of was going a spur of the  moment type thing with the consequences of that decision to be dealt  with later, but I guess I failed to achieve that.</p><p>I'm very happy  that a lot of people liked it. I hope I could update sooner. I wish I  had more time to write, but I don't, so I write when I can.</p><p>Nonengel: I made Nodoka emotionally unstable, so she had an emotional breakdown instead of trying to lop of Genma's head.</p><p>Imortis: I'll deal with each member of the cast eventually.</p><p>Ayanami  Rei II: Yes, I believe that you right about my take on Akane, but I  kind of wanted to come up with something a bit better then the 'I blame  Kuno and the hentai squad' or the 'Akane has rage disorder' or the  'Akane has given into rage because of her mother's death' angles. So I  gave up for the moment and will come back to it later when I figure  something out.</p><p>SSJ Guyver: I admit that I started reading Ranma  fanfiction before I watched the entire anime or read all of the manga,  so my views of Nodoka were altered by fanfiction most likely the stuff  written by DanI Yanega. On a side note, I was hoping you update 'Ranma  : Demonic Lifestyle' because there are not many pairings that follow my  pin name. I'm writing one, but this story has priority at the moment.</p><p>Migele: I would put it up at CoRK but it seems that the site hasn't been updated in a while.</p><p>ET3 James Axelrad: Thank you, and keep reading to find the answers to your questions.</p><p>I  would like to thank everyone and anyone who read and/or reviewed my  story. Anyways, as always, you can leave a review or e-mail me a  comment at:</p><p>tsunami(underscore)saotome(at)yahoo(dot)com</p><p>Oh  and flames will be tossed into Akane's cooking. Then when they're alive  be force fed her cooking to die a slow, painful death.</p>
