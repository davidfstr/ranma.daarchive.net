</div><p>Disclaimer: I don't own  Ranme 1/2 and am doing this for the fun of it.</p><p>Only you...</p><p>By TsunamiSaotome</p><p>It was an hour later that  a freshly dressed Kasumi was bowing and apologizing to a recently  awake Ranma and delighted Nodoka. Nodoka was happy Kasumi had  apparently resolved whatever was troubling her and returned to being  the daughter she had come to love in the previous few weeks. Ranma  was ecstatic to know that Kasumi was the woman he had come to love  again; also he was glad his gamble last night had helped Kasumi,  instead of damaging their relationship. Best of all, he received a  kiss for his actions. Kasumi finally stopped apologizing as Nodoka  spoke.</p><p>"It's okay. Ranma and  I are glad that you've retuned to normal. One thing that we're  wondering is what happened last night that's got you so happy?"</p><p>Ranma nodded agreeing with  his mother.</p><p>Kasumi stood up and  addressed the two in front of her, "Okay, but go sit down at the  table and let me make some tea. It will take a bit of time to tell  you the whole story.</p><p>Mother and son complied  with Kasumi's request and went to settle themselves at the table.  Minutes later, Kasumi approached to the two with a tray holding cups  and a pot of hot tea. After taking a moment to compose herself, she  began to speak about her dream. Omitting certain details that were  disturbing and ones she didn't want to think about. She also skipped  the part where her mother wanted her to continue the art again; she  would wait until after breakfast before telling that part. When  Kasumi finished her story, Ranma was the first to respond.</p><p>"I'm very grateful to  her for helping you, and also for helping me find you." Ranma  easily accepted that Kasumi's mother, though dead, had visited her  daughter in her sleep. After all, stranger things had happened to  Ranma before, many times, in fact.</p><p>"I'm also glad that  Kimiko intervened, because I can see that you two have something  special, as I'm sure she can as well." Nodoka was very happy  with the knowledge that her best friend approved of her son.</p><p>"Well, I'm beginning  to really stink, so I should use the furo." With that Ranma  started to make his way to his room. He'd taken about three steps  before being interrupted by Kasumi.</p><p>"Could you wear a  towel while bathing?" Kasumi quickly asked.</p><p>"Hmmm...why?"  Ranma was confused at the odd request.</p><p>"eh he he...uhh...no  reason...never mind." Kasumi tried to retract her previous  statement, realizing she'd embarrassed herself.</p><p>Ranma and Nodoka directed  odd looks at Kasumi before going off to do their tasks. Ranma to his  much needed soak, and Nodoka to start the breakfast preparations  interrupted by Kasumi's explanation.</p><p>As the two were leaving,  Kasumi could feel her mother give her a raspberry then follow Ranma.</p><p>Sighing in defeat, Kasumi  walked to the kitchen and started to help Nodoka make their morning  meal. She couldn't do anything to stop her mother from peeking in on  Ranma short of putting up wards, but knowing that both of her mothers  were best friends, she knew that her mother would find a way to get  back at her, most likely through Nodoka... er, her other mother.</p><p>Soon enough, Ranma  finished his bath and breakfast was over. The only odd thing during  the meal was Ranma had constantly been sneaking peeks at Kasumi. He  was still on an emotional high from his little gamble which had,  thankfully, succeeded.</p><p>When all three finished,  Kasumi took a breath and steadied herself, "There was something  else that happened in my dream that I didn't tell you." Seeing  that she now had the full attention of both Ranma and Nodoka, she  continued, "At the end of my time with mother, she asked me to  start practicing her...our school again. So, there is a request I  would make of both of you... Ranma, could you start training me? And  mother, could you take me to the Enjeru dojo?"</p><p>Nodoka was quick to nod;  while, Ranma was very hesitant.</p><p>"I... I don't know  Kasumi..." Ranma saw that Kasumi was hurt because of what he said  and quickly explained himself, "I don't know if I can be a good  teacher. I mean, I've only had one example of a teacher, and the  only person who deserves to be taught like that would be the teacher  himself."</p><p>"Ranma, I understand  you have doubts but this is something very important to me, and I  want to share it with the people I care for. I trust and believe in  you." Kasumi's voice was one that Ranma had not heard of very  much in his life until very recently. It was a voice of warmth,  love, and utter devotion.</p><p>Reluctantly, Ranma agreed.   He still had doubts about how well he could teach and train her but  the sheer amount of faith Kasumi had in him moved him enough to try.</p><p>"I'll arrange for a  car in the afternoon. Is that all right with you, Kasumi?"  Nodoka asked, "Both of you go get a couple days worth of clothes  ready, it's been nearly a year since I visited."</p><p>"How often do you go  there?" Kasumi wanted to know.</p><p>"At least two or  three times a year, maybe more if I get too lonely." Nodoka's  face grew distant as she recalled most of the times she spent at her  best friend's old home.</p><p>Kasumi took Nodoka's hand,  "This time we could make happy memories, like when you and my  mother were together, because..."</p><p>Ranma picked up, "...you  won't be alone."</p><p>Nodoka smiled in gratitude  at her children's attempt to cheer her up. "I want to spend at  least a week there. We're going to clean the place up, and I'm sure  Kasumi would like to spend some time getting to know her mother's  first home."</p><p>Ranma and Kasumi quickly  agreed and soon were in their respective rooms packing for an  extended stay.</p><p>Within the hour Sakiri had  arrived and the three of them quickly loaded everything into the  black car. The car ride was a relatively quiet one. Kasumi was  thinking of what her mother's childhood home would be like. Nodoka  was reliving better times she had at her friend's home. Ranma was  thinking of ways he could train Kasumi that didn't seem too extreme.  The only bad thing about that was Ranma had developed a very warped  sense of what was extreme and what was not. While Ranma was thinking  he was staring vacantly at the passing scenery. Ranma was staring  vacantly at the passing scenery as he debated the merits and flaws of  the various training methods he'd been exposed to.</p><p>Had he been paying  attention, he would have noticed as the car moved from the heavily  forested area surrounding their home to a lightly wooded area  surrounding a small community. They passed a small, empty, school  that was out for break, a small market place, and several townspeople  going about their business. By simply looking around one could tell  that, despite looking like a small and rural village, the town was an  upper-class community. There were some obvious signs of wealth, such  as the majority of the cars were very expensive, the homes in the  area were huge compared to the normal Japanese home, and each home  was surrounded by a good amount of space. Along with the obvious  signs there were many subtle ones as well. If one were to look close  enough, they could see that almost everything that was sold was  expensive, the people they passed were wearing expensive clothing or  jewelry, and the town looked like it was kept extremely clean. After  a short, twenty-minute, drive their black car pulled into an enormous  house that easily set itself apart from its peers in the area.</p><p>"Children, this will  be our home for a while." When she spoke, her voice pulled her  children from their thoughts. Ranma and Kasumi stared in awe. They  had thought their other home was big, but this place was bigger.</p><p>The house was more like a  small mansion and was easily twice the size of Nodoka's summer home.  It was a surprisingly simple wooden home, but what made it so  impressive was it sheer size. It had, what appeared to be, two  triangular roofs put together, but on closer inspection it was two  separate buildings connected by a stone pathway. The larger building  had a window in the triangle of the roof, and below that window was  an oak brown door that was the same color as the roof. The rest of  the front of the house was painted white. In the front of the house  was the driveway, it was in the shape of an semi-circle with both  ends accessible to the main road.</p><p>When the car stopped,  Kasumi quickly convinced Ranma to bring in her things and went  looking around the house. The front door opened to a small hallway,  which led to the main living room. When Kasumi first walked into the  room she noticed that the room was decorated with many traditional  items and also had many modern things tastefully mixed in. To her  right she could see a set of stairs. Kasumi went to her left and  through a set of double doors...and nearly had an orgasm. On one  side she could see many traditional tools for her to cook with; on  the other she could see a modern kitchen with many of the newest  kitchen appliances available. She made her way to what looked like a  giant seasoning rack, looking at the herbs nearly made her knees  buckle, here was every herb and spice she could think of. What made  her wet and caused her knees to almost fail was the amount of rare  and expensive herbs she saw there. She also developed a couple of  thoughts of what the food would do to Ranma when she served it, or  what Ranma would do to her when she was served with the food. Kasumi  resisted the urge to smack herself, 'I have been spending too much  time around both my mothers, I'm becoming perverted.' Kasumi thought  to herself.</p><p>Shaking most of the  naughty thoughts from her mind, she exited through the door at the  upper right corner furthest away from her entrance to the room.  Walking through the doorway led her to the dining area with a wooden  table. To her left were sliding doors that opened to an engawa  veranda, to her right was a hallway back to the living area. Making  her way through the doors and a short hallway that were in front of  her, Kasumi found herself in a tea room. Returning to the dining  room, she exited through the veranda, most of the open area looked  like it was set up to be a training ground. To her right were two  paths, one running parallel to the veranda to the second building,  the second path also ran to the right but to the left of the dojo and  circled a Japanese style garden. She could see some Koi swimming in  the pond that was obviously the centerpiece of the garden. Kasumi  moved along the path parallel to the veranda and paused at the  entrance of the second building.</p><p>It was her mother's  dojo... and now it was hers...</p><p>Kasumi tentatively took  one step inside, then another. She could see that the dojo had been  very well cared for, and she could also see it had been used  constantly until these recent few years. She could sense the  centuries of dedication that passed through this dojo. Feeling  intimidated and unworthy, she backed away, and was about to turn and  run back to the house, but a firm, strong hand grabbed hers and held  her in place. Frantically spinning around her eyes locked  onto...Ranma's warm, handsome and loving face, and behind him Nodoka  was exuding a secure and comforting aura.</p><p>"I..." was all  Kasumi could get out before Nodoka cut her off.</p><p>"Your mother sent you  here, so she believes you can learn she school; I know and believe  you can, as well, and..."</p><p>"...I do to. I don't  know how well I can teach you but I have no doubts in my mind, soul,  or heart that you can, and will, master the fallen angels' schools  of martial arts." With each word Ranma slowly guided Kasumi to  the shrine in the dojo.</p><p>When the three of them  reached the shrine, all three bowed in respect and offered a silent  prayer. Kasumi, though, added one more: "Please let me prove to  myself that I am worthy."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi had carefully  kneeled and removed the floorboard revealing six carefully labeled  boxes: Novice, Intermediate, Advance, Master, Grand Master, and  finally Forbidden. She took the boxes with the beginner scrolls and  then put the floorboard back. She paused for a couple of seconds,  then glanced at Ranma.<p>"We'll begin  tomorrow, for today let's just get settled in and rest, okay?"  Ranma answered the question in her gaze.</p><p>After that, the three  gathered their things and went off to find rooms to claim as their  own. Next to the stairs was a set of empty rooms that went  unclaimed, up the stairs there were four bedrooms, one large master  chamber, two smaller rooms below it, and another off to the side of  the master room.</p><p>Kasumi tried to claim one  of the smaller rooms, but Nodoka would have no part of it and ordered  Ranma to take Kasumi's luggage and place it in the master bedroom.  Kasumi started to argue but was silenced by Nodoka. Nodoka explained  that she had given Sakiri the papers that would make Kasumi the  official head of the Enjeru clan and that, by all rights and means,  the master bedroom was hers. Kasumi relented after that and entered  her new room. The room itself was large, being about the same size  as the main living area on the floor below, though was very bare, it  only had two pieces of furniture: a huge bed, and a very old mirror.  The most notable thing that she found about the bedroom was that it  had its own private furo. While Kasumi and Ranma were distracted by  the room itself, Nodoka had started to move Ranma's stuff into it as  well. Nodoka had just finished arranging Kasumi's lingerie and  Ranma's boxers and admiring her work when the other two occupants  finally noticed what she was doing.</p><p>'Ack!' summed up their  simultaneous reactions.</p><p>Nodoka was ushered out of  the room by the now red faced couple and sat in the hall pouting  watching all of her work being undone. Ranma moved his things into  the room closest to Kasumi's, and the two quickly settled in. Nodoka  temporally withdrew from her endless battle for grandchildren to  start lunch and devise another plan to get her children to share a  bed.</p><p>Soon enough, Ranma and  Kasumi wandered down from their rooms after smelling lunch being  prepared.</p><p>"Mother, where did  you get the meat, I was here earlier and didn't see any?" Kasumi  blushed as remembered her reactions when she explored this room.</p><p>Nodoka looked at Kasumi  and, at seeing Kasumi's blush, she cast a sideways glance towards  Ranma, and then answered her daughter, "When I called Sakiri, I  asked her to do a small grocery run for me, but we only have enough  for lunch so you two will have to go get some more food for dinner."</p><p>Ranma wasn't really paying  attention; he was busy trying to get a taste of lunch. While Nodoka  was talking with Kasumi her hands were busily fending off Ranma's  attempts at a pre-lunch snack.</p><p>"Okay." Kasumi  grabbed Ranma's arm and pulled him away from the food causing him to  pout, setting off a round of chuckling from Nodoka and Kasumi.</p><p>"Could you and Ranma  go set the table?" Nodoka directed her request at Kasumi.</p><p>"Sure." Kasumi  dragged a now distressed Ranma away from the food. Nodoka smiled at  her children's antics then quickly turned her attention back to  making lunch.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>After Lunch, while Kasumi  was busy cleaning up, Nodoka took Ranma to her room. Just like when  the three of them first went to their new home, Nodoka also had a  fully finished room in this home as well. As with her room at the  other house the room was very simply decorated. The bed was covered  in a white satin bedspread but when Ranma took a closer look he could  see a floral design done in a light sparkling white thread. The one  difference between both rooms was that this room had lots, maybe  hundreds, of figures and other little items were carefully arranged  around the entire room.<p>"Here." Nodoka  had walked over to one of the dressers and pulled out a huge amount  of yen.</p><p>"I can't!" was  Ranma's first response, but was quickly cut off by his mother.</p><p>"Yes, you can.  Consider it your allowance." Nodoka's voice meant that there was  no arguing the point.</p><p>Ranma conceded to his  mother and counted the money and nearly dropped the wad, "There's  100,000 yen here!"</p><p>His mother's causal  response was, "So?"</p><p>"It's so much!"  Ranma, in his entire life, never thought that he would be holding  this much money.</p><p>"You two are going to  get supplies for dinner and, honestly, the two of you need a bigger  selection of clothes!" Nodoka remarked.</p><p>"Clothes shopping..."  Ranma wined.</p><p>"It's not too bad.  You could take Kasumi shopping for some lingerie. I seem to remember  that you enjoyed what she had on this morning." Nodoka's last  comment had the desired effect on Ranma that she wanted.</p><p>Ranma flushed as his eyes  gained a far away look.</p><p>Nodoka gently pushed the  preoccupied Ranma out of her room and helpfully left him in front of  Kasumi's door.</p><p>It was a few minutes later  when Kasumi went to get something from her room and found Ranma  standing in front of her door with a dazed look on his face.</p><p>"Ranma?" Kasumi  probed.</p><p>"He  he...white...lacy...see-through...eh he he..." Images form  earlier that morning flooded Ranma mind and overrode his higher brain  functions.</p><p>Kasumi blushed as her  imagination, thanks to her mother's constant teasing, came up with  what Ranma was imagining; "Is there anything you wanted?"</p><p>Snapping out of his daze,  he spoke the one thought that had all but filled his mind, "Let's  go shopping for some lingerie."</p><p>Instead of the  chestnut-haired angel swaying in Ranma's fantasy, Kasumi's  imagination supplied her with a scantly clad redhead posing shyly and  offering herself up to anything Kasumi could come up with.</p><p>Ranma was woken from his  daydream by, what sounded like, the word 'Grandchildren' being  whispered.</p><p>The first sensation he  felt was that of his left arm being wrapped around something, his  right hand gripping something firm and toned. Also there was  something warm and 'nice' pressed against his abs. He slowly opened  his eyes and found himself looking at a... his... timeless beauty:  Kasumi Enjeru. He pulled his arm in a bit tighter, bringing Kasumi  just a bit closer to him. Whatever his hand was resting on felt a  bit different, and upon looking down, he almost fainted, almost  suffering a vicious nosebleed in the process.</p><p>Ranma froze, and again his  long denied hormones began to react.</p><p>Somehow his hand had  bunched up the left side of Kasumi's dress, then managed to find its  way underneath her dress, and seemed to be rested on her outer thigh.   When he had moved his hand higher, he had inadvertently exposed  Kasumi's light blue lace panties to his field of vision.</p><p>Kasumi was distracted from  her imagination when she felt something rough and yet, somehow, soft  being drawn across her sensitive skin. When her senses began to  return to her, Kasumi was flooded with warmth, as well as a healthy  dose of arousal. Almost happily, she drowned in the feeling that her  body was exuding. She felt her hands on something hard as she slowly  began to flex her hand... no, it wasn't hard, just very firm.  After feeling whatever it was her hand had been massaging shiver, she  opened her eyes only to find her own blue-gray eyes trapped by  Ranma's sapphire orbs.</p><p>'Those are Ranma's eyes,  but they're so different.' was Kasumi's first thought. Ranma's eyes  showed shock, fear, and... lust. 'He wants me... and only me...' and  for the first time in her entire life, her intense sexual desires  overwhelmed her rational mind.</p><p>Ranma stared into Kasumi's  eyes, which held something that Ranma had only seen in his dreams.  Kasumi elicited the same reactions and emotions in him now as she did  in his dreams and fantasies, except these feelings were real, and so  much more powerful. Ranma could feel the fire of lust and desire  swirling around Kasumi, which only amplified what he felt coming from  within himself. 'She's... perfect, and could have anyone she wants,  but she wants me... and only me...' Ranma's thoughts died a swift and  pleasurable death as he saw Kasumi's lips moving toward his, but he  did nothing to stop their progression... in fact, he welcomed them.</p><p>Just as she had done right  after she had woken up, Kasumi meshed her lips with Ranma's, but  unlike his reaction earlier in the morning, Ranma returned her kiss  just as passionately.</p><p>Somehow they had moved, or  had been moved, into Kasumi's room. A fact which Kasumi,  unknowingly, took full advantage of as she used her hands to gently  reposition Ranma, causing him to fall on top of her bed. Ranma's  reaction to the sudden jolt was to part his lips a bit, which was all  Kasumi needed, allowing her to force her tongue into his mouth.  Ranma was stunned at Kasumi's aggressiveness, but it quickly  disappeared, and soon their tongues were dancing together.</p><p>As their mouths came  together, their hands didn't stay idle. Kasumi's hand continued to  massage his taught stomach as the other hand had worked its way up to  Ranma's chest. Ranma's hand freely roamed Kasumi's body, every time  he touched a sensitive spot and caused her to shiver; he paused to  pay more specialized attention to that spot eliciting moans from  Kasumi, which were only muffled by their kiss.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>As Nodoka made her way  from the doorway of Kasumi's room she had a happy grin on her face,  and with each sound coming from the room her grin became wider and  wider as one thought consumed her entire being: 'GRANDCHILDREN!'<hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was over an hour later  that Ranma and Kasumi finally emerged from her room. Both had  healthy blushes decorating their faces as they rejoined their mother.<p>Ranma looked at his mother  and saw that she appeared to be disappointed and a bit agitated,  "Mom, what's wrong?"</p><p>"Phhht...all you two  did was kiss." Nodoka sounded agitated now.</p><p>Ranma, of course, had no  clue what his mother was talking about and replied with a, "Huh?"</p><p>That was when Kasumi  walked up to Nodoka and gasped. Ranma moved next to Kasumi to see  what she was looking at, but only saw a television, "So, what's  so special about a television?"</p><p>Kasumi temporary forgot  her embarrassment and sighed in exasperation, "What's on the  screen, Ranma?"</p><p>"A picture of your  room," Ranma responded without really thinking about it. A  second passed, then another, then a third, and finally, "Urk!"</p><p>Kasumi let out a breath as  Ranma finally realized what was so embarrassing. She watched Ranma  turn a shade red reminiscent of their mother's red highlights.  Kasumi remembered that it was them, as in the 'them' that included  her, which caused her embarrassment to return with a vengeance, she  was quite impressive as she had managed to maintain a shade brighter  then Ranma. 'If she pulls a couple more stunts like this last one,  she'll get grandchildren a lot sooner then Ranma and I thought.'  Through her blush she turned to Nodoka with a nervous glance.</p><p>Nodoka looked at her and,  as if reading Kasumi's thoughts, the small smirk that both Ranma and  Kasumi had come to fear appeared on her face.</p><p>Kasumi began to get very  nervous, "Come on, Ranma... We have to... uh... go shopping  and... umm... get stuff for dinner." Kasumi tightly gripped  Ranma's hand and pulled him out of the house. Ranma's mind was still  getting itself wrapped around the idea that there had been a camera  in Kasumi's room.</p><p>"Ranma..."  Kasumi uttered in a small and embarrassed tone.</p><p>Ranma, knowing she was  thinking the same thing, took a deep breath and spoke, "Knowing  mom, we should have expected something like this." Ranma then  pushed all of the other thoughts out of his mind and concentrated on  Kasumi.</p><p>Kasumi paused and thought  about it, and about what both of her mothers might do, and  reluctantly nodded.</p><p>"Nothing we can  really do about it now so come on!" Ranma turned the tables and  began to drag Kasumi along.</p><p>"Ranma... hey... come  on, stop... Ranma... where are we going?..." Kasumi rambled on.</p><p>"..."  Ranma wined.</p><p>Kasumi cracked a smile and  then giggled at Ranma's long-winded, over-dramatic, high-pitched  wine.</p><p>"Good, you're  laughing again! Come on!" Ranma then slumped, "The things  I must torture myself with to please the one I care for..."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi just wrapped her  arms around Ranma's bicep and pulled herself closer to him. Then,  with smiles on their faces, the two walked deeper into town.<p>It only took ten minutes  for the two to make it into the heart of town. Having people glance  at them and start whispering to those around them for the first few  minutes of their entering town was getting to Ranma, and he started  to fidget. It was a few moments later when Kasumi pulled Ranma to a  secluded spot and tried calming him down by kissing him.</p><p>"What's a matter,  Ranma?" Kasumi asked after she broke the kiss, which achieved  the desired result.</p><p>"It's just that I'm  not used to this." Ranma admitted.</p><p>"What? You should be  used to people staring at you by now." Kasumi spoke with a  feathery smile.</p><p>Ranma chuckled, "Oh,  I'm used to that, but for other reasons, not this one." Ranma  gestured to Kasumi's arms wrapped around his.</p><p>"Do... do you want me  to stop?" Kasumi hesitantly asked with a quivering voice.</p><p>"NO! NO! NO! It's  just that, I kind of wanted to know why. That's all." Ranma had  used his other arm to rub Kasumi's back.</p><p>Kasumi relaxed against  Ranma's chest, "I think I know why. I think this community is  very small, so everyone knows everyone else. Since we're new faces,  all the people who see us become curious."</p><p>Ranma took a moment to  think over what Kasumi said, and accepted it. Even if it wasn't  true, coming from Kasumi, it served to calm his nerves. After a long  moment together, Ranma pulled Kasumi back to the main street and the  two began to window shop.</p><p>After twenty minutes, the  two passed dozens of stores, but never entered one. Oddly enough, it  was Ranma who realized that both he and Kasumi never had much and so  they would only take what could get, never going out and getting  something for themselves unless it was absolutely necessary. So  Kasumi was surprised when Ranma pulled her into a store. When they  entered the store Ranma saw something that made him smirk. When they  stopped, Kasumi gathered herself enough to talk.</p><p>"Ranma, what are we  doing in here?" Kasumi was confused as to why they were in that  particular store.</p><p>Ranma looked at Kasumi,  "To by clothes, why else would we be in here?"</p><p>"But isn't it  expensive?" Kasumi had a bit of worry in her voice. She had seen  one of the price tags and her mind boggled. She had never spent so  much for clothing, and now Ranma wanted them to buy clothing from  this shop.</p><p>"Its alright, I got some  money." Ranma explained.</p><p>Kasumi slowly followed,  she figured that Ranma could buy all he wanted, and she would just  stand there and watch him shop.</p><p>The first item that Ranma  picked up was a pair of blue jeans. The odd thing, to Kasumi, was  that the jeans looked too small for Ranma's male body and to long  for his female body. Kasumi was about to tell Ranma but he was  studying them so intensely so she held her tongue. The next piece  that Ranma picked out was enough to make Kasumi gasp in shock. It  was a white halter-top that would expose Ranma's midriff. Kasumi did  find it a bit odd that Ranma was buying cloths for his girl half, but  it didn't really matter as Ranma was always Ranma, no matter the  shape or form.</p><p>Ranma was making his way  to the dressing area. Kasumi was quietly following behind Ranma as  he moved through the store, and nearly bumped into him when he  stopped at a stall and turned around.</p><p>"These should fit  you, go try them on." Ranma then dropped the clothing he was  holding into Kasumi's arms.</p><p>Kasumi was so surprised  that all she could keep saying was, "But... but... but... but...  but..." even as Ranma pushed her into an empty stall.</p><p>Standing outside the  stall, Ranma spoke, "Now hurry, because we still have to pick up  stuff for dinner."</p><p>Kasumi was still frozen in  the stall and muttering the same word over and over again.</p><p>Ranma's voice became  playful as he spoke his next few words, "Buuut if you want, I  could go in there and help you."</p><p>That brought Kasumi back  and her cheeks colored as she recalled the first time they made out  earlier in the day. She was tempted to have him come in and try, but  she didn't want to get kicked out of the store. She took off her  dress, folded it and carefully put on the foreign articles of  clothing she had acquired from Ranma. After she finished dressing,  she looked in the mirror and suddenly felt self-conscious. She  opened the stall door and took small, reluctant steps until she was  in front of Ranma and timidly posed for him.</p><p>Kasumi had closed her eyes  as she waited for Ranma's opinion. As the seconds passed her  nervousness grew towards agitation but she remained silent and  waited, and waited, and waited some more. Finally reaching the end  of her patience, her eyes snapped open in time to witness Ranma's  eyes slowly roaming her body, his mouth opened to say something but  nothing came. Normally, Kasumi wouldn't really care but having  Ranma, the person she loved, look at her like that was a huge boost  to her ego and confidence. Feeling bold, Kasumi swayed closer to  Ranma, each movement designed to magnify her feminine charms, and  doing so flawlessly. When she was close enough, she bent forward,  giving Ranma a full view of her cleavage and held that pose until  Ranma's eyes drifted downwards, "You like?"</p><p>Ranma's breaths came  quickly and were very shallow. All he could do was nod once, his eyes  never leaving the divine sight before him"</p><p>"Good..."  Kasumi's husky voice left Ranma shivering in pleasure.</p><p>Kasumi stood up straight  and slowly, sensually walked back into the stall. She could feel  Ranma's eyes glued to her body the entire time as she made her way  back. As soon as the door closed Kasumi practically collapsed onto  the small bench in the room. Her breathing was now ragged and rapid  as she thought, 'Kami, I've never done that before, but it felt so  good.' She took a couple of minutes to let herself calm down, put on  her old dress, now seeming rather tame, and stepped out of the small  room.</p><p>It was a good thing Kasumi  had taken the time to recover because Ranma seemed to have needed  every second. When Kasumi stepped out in front of Ranma again, he  had yet to completely recover, but at least he was capable of speech.   It wasn't intentional, or maybe it was; either way, Kasumi had given  Ranma a lot more images to play with in his dreams. When he saw  Kasumi he said what he'd tried to say a few minutes ago, "Wow...  beautiful... good... Kami-sama... hot... wow..." He was able to  speak, but no one said it would be coherent.</p><p>When Ranma was able to  figure out how to walk again, he led Kasumi to the cashier and paid  for her outfit. Ranma and Kasumi entered another shop a few minutes  later, and once again Ranma made his ways directly to the women's  clothing section. Ranma picked up a white tube top, turned to Kasumi  and held it in front of her. Unknown to Kasumi, Ranma had remembered  all of those lessons his mother had tried to teach Ranko, and now was  using that knowledge to his advantage.</p><p>Kasumi started to blush as  she imagined herself wearing it, "Ranma, shouldn't you go get  some clothing for yourself."</p><p>Ranma gently smiled as he  shook his head, "No, I already have enough and I wanted to buy  something for you."</p><p>Kasumi knew that this  wasn't true as both she and Ranma didn't own much, and she knew  she still had so much more than he did. Comparing the clothing they  brought with them when they left the Tendo home, Kasumi easily had  three to four times more then Ranma. This confused her as, if  anything, Ranma needed the clothes more then she did, but everything  Ranma was looking at or purchasing was for her. He never needed, and  could never have, much on the road and would never buy anything  unless he needed it, just... like... her... Kasumi wanted to kick  herself in the shin. Like herself, Ranma wouldn't buy something  for himself unless absolutely necessary, so someone else would have  to buy that something for either of them. 'Ranma thought of this a  while ago. That's why he's been leading me to all these places'  Kasumi told herself, then she promptly latched onto Ranma's arms  and dragged him over to the men's section.</p><p>"Hey! I'm not...done,  yet!" Ranma protested as he was dragged off.</p><p>Kasumi worked quickly as  she selected a combination that was similar to what Ranma had bought  for her: A simple pair of blue jeans and a white t-shirt. Kasumi  handed Ranma the clothing and shoved him into a dressing booth, a  silent command telling him to try them on, or else. Ranma briefly  blinked at the wall in front of him, then began to switch clothes.  After all, he didn't want to see what she would do if he disobeyed  her.</p><p>When Ranma finished  getting dressed, he strode out of the dressing room and stood in  front of Kasumi with an air of confidence. The jeans fit Ranma  almost like a second skin, but the shirt was a bit loose on his upper  body, she had to take into account Ranma's other form. This would  work for now, but she would need to make some adjustments later, and  she told Ranma to walk a few steps so she could see what she would  need to do. She never saw if she needed to do anything because as  soon as Ranma took the first step out of the booth, her eyes became  glued to his muscles and the blue material that strained against his  rippling form with every slight movement. Out of the corner of her  eye, Kasumi caught the sales girl directing a hungry look towards  Ranma. This made her ego grow a bit bigger because she knew that she  and Ranma were committed to each other. Now, normally one would think  that Kasumi would become territorial and attack the female who wanted  to chase her mate, but with Kasumi, Ranma received her, well  deserved, total and utter faith. Ranma stood there waiting for  Kasumi's judgment, and was growing anxious due to her extended  silence.</p><p>"Very nice."  Kasumi finally spoke to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma was visibly relieved  as he heard Kasumi complimenting him. He turned to re-enter the  stall and thus failed to notice that both girls had their eyes glued  to his powerful and well-defined muscles.</p><p>As soon as Ranma had  finished getting back into his street clothes, Kasumi escorted him  past an envious sales girl and paid for Ranma's new clothes.</p><p>For the next few stores a  pattern developed. Ranma would choose clothes for Kasumi and after  he sent her to model the selections for him, they would switch roles  and repeat the process. Somehow, the modeling part became a bit of a  competition, one would pose and try to get a reaction out of the  other then, when they traded places, the person doing the modeling  would try to get a better reaction then before. Kasumi, much to  Ranma's agitation, easily won. As a man, Ranma had used his natural  charm and a smile, unlike as a woman where he had learned to use his  'gifts', usually for free food and such. Another facet that led to  Ranma's downfall was that Kasumi was able to hide her reactions more  effectively. In the end, both Ranma and Kasumi were having a  wonderful time teasing and being with each other.</p><p>Kasumi looked around while  she and Ranma were walking amongst the stores and saw one that  sparked an idea she was sure would make either of her mothers beam  with pride. Telling Ranma she was thirsty prompted a stop at a  vending machine for a cold drink, and she started enacting the plan  she had come up with. Kasumi looked around to see if anyone was  looking, and when she saw that there was no one in their immediate  vicinity, Kasumi turned to her target.</p><p>Ranma watched as Kasumi  purchased a bottle of water from the vending machine, but didn't  think much of it. After all, if Kasumi wanted bottled water, who was  he to question her choice of drink? Ranma had taken all of two steps  when Kasumi upended the bottle over Ranma's head. Ranma sputtered  and spun around to ask Kasumi why she did that, but her words died in  her throat when she saw Kasumi's expression. Ranma froze as Kasumi  took a couple seconds to openly admire him, now her, in her wet  shirt. A reawakening part of Ranma's mind became aroused as Kasumi  looked at her in that way, but that part of Ranma was also lost to  the emotional response that the rest of her was now feeling. Ranma  watched as Kasumi's delicate lips formed a smirk, and it wasn't one  of her normal smirks, oh no, it was the same exact smirk Ranma  herself, or her mother, used when they were planning something  mischievous. To see it on Kasumi's heavenly features scared Ranma  shitless, and froze him in place.</p><p>Taking advantage of  Ranma's apparent inability to move under his own power, Kasumi pulled  Ranma towards the street but after only a handful of steps Ranma  seemed to completely lose his willingness to move. After a couple of  futile attempts to pull Ranma along, Kasumi licked her lips as an  idea came to her. Fortunately for Ranma, Kasumi's was plan was  quite pleasurable: Kiss her till she can move again. Kasumi  initiated the kiss and forced her tongue into Ranma's mouth. It  only took Ranma half a second to instinctively respond to the kiss.  A few minutes later Kasumi broke contact, leaving Ranma in a daze and  wanting more. Kasumi knew the kiss didn't have to last quite that  long but she enjoyed it too much to want it to end so soon. After  Kasumi reluctantly released the kiss, she led the stupefied Ranma  into a store.</p><p>The only living Enjeru  family member, in her over-eagerness, had forgotten to look through  nearby windows before initiating the kiss, and had inadvertently put  on a show for a small bar/restaurant whose customers had had a  perfect view of the lip lock. Nearly all of the men complained about  how all the pretty girls were lesbians. Unfortunately, not all the  men were single and those who weren't got slapped and/or glared at by  their significant other, leading to days or even weeks of begging for  forgiveness. Not all of the women acted that way, of course. Some  wondered if they could join in and others were indifferent, believing  that a person's choice was their own. Then, there were some women  who were attached that were openly leering at the busty redhead and  the elegant chestnut haired girls. The partners of those women  weren't sure if they should be angry, worried, or excited.</p><p>"Ranma... Ranma..."</p><p>Ranma blinked and saw a  hand being waved in front of her eyes, "Huh? wha...what?"</p><p>"Go try this on."  Kasumi hid a small smile.</p><p>"Okay..." Ranma took  the clothing without really paying it any attention. She walked into  the booth and held the item in front of her body and looked in the  mirror...</p><p>The longer Ranma was in  the stall, the harder it was for Kasumi to hold in her giggling. She  had tried to hide a smile, but that proved impossible, so she settled  for trying to not make any noise.</p><p>"AHHHHHHHHHH!"  Ranma nearly tore the door off the dressing room, "This  is...this...is..."</p><p>"What you wanted to go  shopping for." Kasumi calmly replied.</p><p>Had Ranma not been so  disturbed, she would have seen that amusement was clearly evident in  the former Tendo daughter's eyes.</p><p>The piece of clothing  Ranma held in front of her was plain white lingerie. It wasn't  made to be sexy, or anything, but Ranma's figure could make almost  anything sexy. "But I wanted to get the lingerie for you to wear,  not me."</p><p>Kasumi took a second to  study the article of clothing, then Ranma, "Hmmmm... You're right.   You can't. At least, not with your body, you can't... You  wouldn't look very good in this at all, would you? You're right, it  probably would look better on me." Kasumi then snatched the  lingerie from Ranma and made her own way to the dressing room.</p><p>Ranma may not have liked  his cursed body when she had first got it, but even she knew that she  was beautiful and desirable and Ranma always took pride in that fact.   Now that she was starting to enjoy her female body she was not going  to let a challenge like that slide.</p><p>Kasumi was taking her time  and had almost made it into the stall when Ranma brushed past her,  grabbed the lingerie, and shut the door to the booth with an audible  click, 'It's all going exactly as I planned it.'</p><p>Ranma had undressed and  put on the lingerie when her mind caught up with what she was doing,  'Aww...man. Damn me and my pride.' Ranma began trying to think  of a way to get Kasumi back, but nothing immediately came to mind, so  she took a moment to study her reflection, 'I seem to make  everything look good, and Kasumi could have found me something  better. Her taste in... clothing... is... so... tame...' had  someone been looking they would have sworn they'd seen a lit light  bulb appear above Ranma's head. 'I could tell her the truth...'</p><p>Almost as soon as she got  the idea, Ranma came up with a plan to get back at Kasumi. With a  general idea of what she wanted to do, Ranma walked out and took a  pose in front of Kasumi. Ranma had both arms behind her back with  one hand holding her other wrist and she stood with her feet close to  each other. She also bent her upper body forward, not quite enough  to expose her cleavage, but enough to tease Kasumi. When she spoke,  her voice was sweet and innocent and, somehow, managed to be sultry  and sexy at the same time.</p><p>"You know, Kasumi,  this looks very good on me, but then I make anything look good. Your  choice is, well... tame. You could have picked something better for  me. Maybe you should stay with getting clothing for my other body,  that way anything you pick would look good."</p><p>When Ranma stepped out of  the changing room and stood before her, it mesmerized Kasumi. Kasumi  could feel a shot of anger as soon as she understood that Ranma had  insulted her taste in clothing, but that was mixed with shock a few  seconds later when she realized Ranma had managed to do it subtly.  She stayed still long enough for Ranma to change, go pick something  else out, put the selected items in her hands, and shove her into the  stall.</p><p>Kasumi looked at the  lingerie in her hands and had to admit that it was a lot more  revealing then the one she picked for Ranma. It was white and still  covered most of her body, but most of the material that made up the  one piece was see-through translucent with some solid white satin  placed in certain areas to keep the wearer covered. She quickly  slipped it on, still simmering about Ranma's miraculously subtle  insult. When she walked out of the dressing room, Kasumi made sure  that she had Ranma's attention, and glided over to Ranma sexily, took  the same pose Ranma had earlier, and spoke to a now stunned Ranma,  "You like?"</p><p>Thus began the lingerie  wars...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma and Kasumi were both  flushed as they made their way to the open food market. Both were  shocked but not to embarrassed about what they had just done. Each  had bought two pieces, each more risqué and exposing than the  one that was picked before. Ranma's thoughts were centered on the  idea that Kasumi looked, well...tasty. Kasumi's thoughts were a bit  more varied but somewhere in her Nodoka corrupted mind, similar  thoughts kept cropping up. Kasumi had kept having difficulty  remembering that the two of them were supposed to get dinner  materials or their mother would get annoyed. That was something  neither of them wanted. So during their last exchange, Kasumi  pounced on Ranma while wearing practically nothing, leaving the  nearly comatose Ranma in a state which gave her enough time to get  dressed, search Ranma for the stash of money, pay for their things,  and pull Ranma to the street. Kasumi was amazed at the reactions her  looks gave to the lingerie clad Ranma but she took a lot of pride in  the fact that she could induce reactions equal, or maybe even  stronger than, those of Ranma. Given all of the teasing and intimate  positions that the two of them had been in, she should have been  surprised at her behavior or responses. She was surprised at Ranma,  though, going through all of the same experiences that she did,  Kasumi would have thought that Ranma would be more used to these  kinds of situations, but she was almost as innocent and naive as when  she first arrived at the Tendo home.<p>When the two girls neared  the open market they were acting so differently that no one would  have guessed at their behavior a few minutes prior. As the prospect  of food presented itself, Ranma set herself off on the unsuspecting  vendors, and with her hands firmly on Kasumi's she forced the other  girl along. Oddly enough, the two of them made an interesting pair;  Ranma was wild, shameless and animated, while Kasumi was meek,  embarrassed and shy.</p><p>Entering their second  home, Ranma was carrying multiple armloads of bags filled with food  and clothing, as was Kasumi. At the door Nodoka watched as her  daughters walked into the kitchen with their purchases.</p><p>"I see you two have  been busy."</p><p>"Uh-huh." came  the muffled reply form her redheaded daughter.</p><p>Nodoka quickly and  efficiently began putting the food away, but paused as she saw a  store's seal on one of the bags. She raised one eyebrow and turned  to Kasumi.</p><p>Kasumi saw her mother's  inquiring look and saw the bag Nodoka had paused at... and every  thought in her head disappeared, "Ranma wanted to..." She  spoke the first words to come to mind and, unfortunately, deferred to  Ranma.</p><p>Ranma picked up the  statement, trying hard not to swallow her foot, "Practice!"  and failing.</p><p>Kasumi's jaw really hurt  from its attempt to hit the floor.</p><p>"Oh well, don't let  these groceries stop you, let me take care of them so you two can  have more time to yourselves."</p><p>"Thanks, mom."  Ranma called back as she grabbed a shocked Kasumi and pulled her  toward the stairs.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi walked into the  living room, relieved. It had taken her a while to figure out what  Ranma was talking about during the flirting they did while buying the  dinner ingredients, though it was embarrassing, it wasn't as  humiliating as talking about their sex life. A happy male Ranma  followed Kasumi as the two of them quickly made their way into the  kitchen and began to help Nodoka with dinner.<p>"Apparently, you both  enjoyed your little shopping spree. You even went to one of my  favorite shops." Nodoka developed a far away look, "Seeing  those bags brought back a lot of fond memories of Kimiko."</p><p>Ranma thanked his mother,  though he didn't really understand why a bag would remind his mother  of Kasumi's, so he just nodded and smiled.</p><p>Kasumi, when she heard  Nodoka's words, paled. She then watched Nodoka look at her and felt  like she was watching a train wreck, as a spark of reconciliation  grew in her mother's eyes. Kasumi only thought was, 'She knows that I  know!' and she felt like crawling into a cabinet to hide, eternity  couldn't be that long, could it? Kasumi was pulled from her plans  for the future when Ranma asked a question.</p><p>"Mom, what's that?"  Ranma was a bit pensive.</p><p>Nodoka and Kasumi both  looked at the object Ranma had pointed at. Kasumi instantly knew why  Ranma sounded pensive; it was the television screen that still showed  a picture of her room.</p><p>"Just some old video  of Kasumi's mother and I." Nodoka replied and noticed the relief  in Ranma's face and tried to figure out why he was so relieved.  Ranma's mother looked at her son, then at the television, then her  daughter, and back to the television. "You thought that I would  put a camera in Kasumi's room to record my son's special moments?"</p><p>"Urk!" came the  dual reply.</p><p>"As much as that is a  great idea, I know that you, Ranma, have never received any kind of  privacy, either due to your father or at the Tendo dojo thanks to  Nabiki. I want to give you the privacy to do whatever you want on  your own, and since you have done nothing wrong to deserve that  privilege to be violated or revoked." Nodoka started speaking in  a light humorous tone but she had taken on a very serious tone at the  end of her rant.</p><p>Oddly, Ranma began to  speak meekly, "Then...then how did you know that the only thing  Kasumi and me did was kiss this morning?"</p><p>"Ranma, you know that  I practice the art, right?" seeing her son nod Nodoka continued,  "I am able to see ki and chi flows and a virgin has a slightly  different aura from a person who is not and you and Kasumi are still  clearly virgins."</p><p>"Oh..." was the  only thing a red faced Ranma could say.</p><p>"Although, I would  love it if I received a grandchild in nine months." Nodoka  sighed, "You two are cruel, making me wait this long, but I  guess it's your choice. I had a few more things I wanted to try,  but I guess I'll let you two take as long as you need."</p><p>Ranma and Kasumi had the  urge to devote themselves to whatever god or goddess had prompted  Nodoka to say that last sentence.</p><p>"Enough talk of  depressing topics, are you two going to help with dinner or not? Oh  and I think you might like this particular video." Soon the  delicious scent of dinner filled the house, along with the sounds of  Kimiko's sixteenth birthday.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma knew that Kasumi was  an early riser, so he had gotten up earlier then usual, in hopes that  he could wake her up. It was a teacher's job to wake the student  after all, and he didn't want a lazy student. The thoughts of  Kasumi's nightie never entered his thoughts...really...kind of...well  not for very long anyways.<p>Sadly, when Ranma checked,  Kasumi's bed was neatly made so, dejectedly, Ranma made his way to  the wash room and cleaned himself up. Once he made his way to the  kitchen, he spotted the object of his desires in the main room,  engrossed in scrolls of her school. Kasumi was also dressed in a  pristine white gi tied together with a white belt.</p><p>"Kasumi..."  Ranma asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>Kasumi looked over to  Ranma and started to rub her hands nervously, "I couldn't sleep,  so I came down here."</p><p>Ranma could understand  why, Kasumi was asked by the spirit of her mother to continue the art  that she had given up in her youth. She wasn't sure if she could do  it, or live up to her mother's expectations. To try and calm  Kasumi's nerves, Ranma put on a gentle and supportive smile, "I  guess I don't have to ask if you're ready?"</p><p>Kasumi took a breath,  stood up and, with that signal, the two of them walked to the dojo to  begin.</p><p>In the dojo, Ranma was  about to instruct Kasumi on the warm up exercises, but was greatly  surprised as Kasumi began to go through the exercises easily and with  no errors.</p><p>Kasumi saw Ranma's  reaction and paused, she then blushed and looked sheepish, "I  kind of spent a lot of time watching you do them."</p><p>Ranma opened his mouth to  try and embarrass her more, but stopped. In this place they were not  boyfriend and girlfriend. Here, they were teacher and student, so he  nodded and continued.</p><p>Once their warm-ups were  done, Ranma spoke, "Now Kasumi, we're not going to start with a  kata from the scrolls, but one from anything-goes because I want to  judge where you are at the moment and how hard I can push you at this  point."</p><p>Kasumi nodded and watched  Ranma carefully as he preformed a basic anything-goes kata. When he  finished, she mimicked the stance and began the kata herself. As she  worked through the kata, Ranma watched her intently. Normally this  would fluster her but she too, like Ranma, recognized that here,  their relationship was different. Ranma corrected her when she made  a mistake and had her run through the kata a few more times to make  sure she didn't have any reflexes that needed to be broken.</p><p>At the end, Ranma nodded,  "Very good. Do you remember how far you were when you stopped  practicing?"</p><p>Kasumi shook her head,  "No, but when I went through the scroll earlier I recognized  almost all of the techniques. I think that I stopped when I was  somewhere in the intermediate level."</p><p>Ranma thought about what  Kasumi said, "It's been so long since you practiced, so we're  going to start from the beginning, okay?"</p><p>Kasumi straightened up and  replied, "Yes, Sensei."</p><p>With that settled the two  of them sat in the middle of the dojo and began to go over the  scrolls of Kasumi's school.</p><p>Over the next week, Kasumi  quickly relearned the basics of her school. Early in the week Ranma  had tried to test Kasumi's learning abilities and was amazed.  Although, nowhere near Ranma's own learning curve, Kasumi's was no  less amazing. Within four days the girl had learned that kata.  'Learned' was a weak word to describe what Kasumi had done; she  didn't just memorize the kata, she began to do the kata with  unearthly grace, something similar to a master. If that was how  quickly and how well Kasumi was going to learn everything, Ranma  easily understood why Kimiko fought with Soun to teach Kasumi the  Fallen Angels' School of Martial Arts. Kasumi was... is... a prodigy  in her own right.</p><p>During the following week,  Ranma and Kasumi spent eight to twelve hours a day training. Their  day usually followed the same path, wake up, get ready, train, eat,  train, eat, train, bathe, spend time with each other and/or their  mother before and after dinner and, finally, sleep. Then, on the  next day they would repeat the process. This was normal for Ranma,  but he wanted to ask Kasumi why she was subjecting herself to this  life style. Ranma had become curious because, yesterday, he watched  as Kasumi modified a kata to do her household chores. At first he  was going to leave it alone, but it kept nagging at him throughout  the entire day, so he was going to ask about it in the morning. When  Kasumi entered the dojo and was about to start her warm up exercises,  Ranma stopped her, "Kasumi?"</p><p>The girl stopped and  looked up, "Yes, Ranma?"</p><p>"I was wondering...  why do you train so hard?" Ranma had paused slightly, not sure  if he should be asking.</p><p>Kasumi closed her eyes in  thought.</p><p>After a few minutes Ranma  thought his questions had been too intrusive. "It's okay, you  don't have to answer."</p><p>Immediately after Ranma  said that, Kasumi answered him, "Ranma, you know that my mother  asked me to start practicing the school, knowing that I am the last  to practice it, right?" She looked at Ranma, who nodded, then  continued, "Being the last of a school means that I am or am  going to be the grandmaster of the school..."</p><p>Ranma eyes widened as he  realized that fact.</p><p>"...making the art a  major part of my life. To become a grandmaster I must have an  enormous amount of dedication, and my life has to be dedicated to the  art. I only know a few people who would be near the level of a  grandmaster, and I have tried to be like one of them. I want to  become a martial artist that won't betray the title of grandmaster."</p><p>It didn't take Ranma long  to realize that she was talking about him. He had said that the art  was life, and it seemed Kasumi was taking that philosophy to heart.  Ranma nodded to her and began to stretch, an action that was quickly  followed by Kasumi. Ranma was going to take Kasumi's training to  another level, if she was going to be a grandmaster, Ranma was train  her and keep training her until they mastered the Fallen Angels'  School of martial arts, and Kasumi could confidently call herself  Grandmaster of the school.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Author's Notes: As always,  I would like to thank my pre-reader DelShalDar.<p>Anyways, as always, you  can leave a review or e-mail me a comment at:</p><p>tsunami(underscore)saotome(at)yahoo(dot)com</p><p>I would like to thank  everyone you took the time to review my story even those who took the  time to read it. I hope hear from everyone again and hopefully even  more people.</p><p>Reviewer Responses:</p><p>Wonderbee31: I like  Nabiki so she won't be to bashed in this story. I'll get to her in  the next chapter. The others are going to attack Ranma's loved ones  but I not good at writing fight scenes (or at least I thinks I'm no  good) so I came up with some non-violent ways do deal with them.</p><p>glazedlookineyes101: I  happy you find my story interesting. The part interlude into Nerima  was suposed to happened last chapter, at least thats what I had  planned in the orginal outline but I started to write more details  into each scene so that didn't happend, but don't worry a part into  Nerima is planned for the next chapter.</p><p>JonnyG: You know I  recently went back to reread my old notebooks and found that this  story was to be a drama and romance story but it became waffy not  what I had orignally planned but I still enjoy writing this story  none the less.</p><p>Rubel: I plan on moving  this story a bit slow but I will deal with all of the NWC eventually.</p><p>shinji the good sharer:  You and you toys smily face. Sorry I haven't logged on my IM  lately but I just don't really feel like chatting lately.</p><p>James Axelrad: I though  that if I picked a unique name it would cause Nabiki to find them  sooner, So I look on the internet for the most common japanese family  names and found Inoue all so Nodoka is a fairly common first name so  I figure that would throw Nabiki off. Also there is another reason  but you'll have to keep reading to find out :)</p><p>Lerris: What you said is  true, but I don't really like those three and that come out in my  writing esspecially when I am free writing.</p><p>nonengel: WOW! I almost  caused you tears. That is as amazing as Ranko telling me I'm funny.  :p</p><p>SSJGuyver: The best you've  read ina while that doesn't seem likely but thank you for saying  that.</p><p>Hiryo: Hmmm... I should  blame you for the update taking so long. ;)I'll read anything that is  a NON akane pairing so I spent a lot of time reading the stories in  you C2 archives. Geart Archive. Yes he will meet his aunt and uncle  but that will be in a later chapter.</p><p>Goku: The interlude to  Nerima was to happen last chapter but It didn't don't worry its going  to happen in the next chapter.</p><p>Oh and flames will be  tossed into Akane's cooking. Then when they're alive be force fed her  cooking to die a slow, painful death.</p>
