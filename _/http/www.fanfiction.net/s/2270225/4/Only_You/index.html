</div><p>Disclaimer:  I don't  own Ranma  1/2  and am  doing this  for the  fun of  it.</p><p>Oh  and flames  will be  tossed into  Akane's  cooking. Then  when they're  alive, they  will be  force fed  her cooking  to die  a slow,  painful death.</p><p>Author's  Notes: Sorry it took so long to get this chapter out, but I had some  problem. I know that I will get the next chapter out sooner.</p><p>Only  You...</p><p>By  TsunamiSaotome</p><p>"Ranma!  Ranma! Please wake up! Ranma!" Kasumi whispered, "Ranma!  This is improper! Please wake up! Ranma!"</p><p>Kasumi  had been  trying to  wake Ranma  for the  previous few  minutes. She  would have  spoken louder,  but she  didn't  want to  wake the  third occupant  of the  room. It  wasn't  that she  feared anger  resulting from  an early  wake up  call. No,  Kasumi was  trying to  save herself  and Ranma  from the  embarrassing remarks  of one,  Nodoka Inoue.   The morning  had started  out normally  enough; with  Kasumi, forgetting  what had  happened the  day before,  getting up  to start  her normal  routine. She  was expecting  to get  out of  bed and  use the  furo, but  since this  was no  longer Kasumi's  bedroom, things  didn't  turn out  as planned.   She woke  up okay,  but being  groggy from  having been  up so  late the  night before,  she didn't  really notice  that her  legs hadn't  gone over  the edge  of a  bed before  reaching the  floor. When  she stood  up and  took a  step, her  feet got  tangled in  her sleeping  bag and  she started  to fall,  which startled  her to  full wakefulness  in an  instant. She  closed her  eyes and  raised her  hands in  front of  her to  try and  absorb the  expected impact.</p><p>Kasumi  had successfully  broken her  fall, the  martial arts  training of  her youth  not completely  forgotten, and  took a  moment to  calm herself.   'That didn't  hurt as  much as  I though  it would.'  was the  eldest Tendo's  first thought.   She closed  her eyes  in an  effort to  rid herself  of the  adrenaline that  flooded her  body. Her  eyes remained  closed while  she tried  to calm  herself, even  as the  adrenaline rush  flooding her  body urged  her to  move. Kasumi  was about  to lift  herself up,  and nearly  started to  panic as  something grabbed  her. Upon  opening her  eyes, she  found herself  centimeters from  Ranma's  face. 'Oh  My!' was  her overriding  thought as  she stared  at Ranma's  slumbering features.</p><p>Ranma  lay dreaming.   One might  believe because  of Ranma's  martial arts  training, Ranma  knew Kasumi  was up,  but since  Kasumi was  categorized as  both a  non-combatant  and a  non-threat,  Ranma continued  blissfully sleeping.   When Kasumi  had started  to fall,  Ranma's  subconscious recognized  that said  non-threat  might be  hurt and  immediately took  action to  prevent damage,  with the  final result  being Ranma  turning onto  his back  and using  his body  to cushion  Kasumi's  fall, all  without disturbing  his slumber.   When Kasumi  was no  longer in  danger, Ranma's  mind relaxed  and his  natural instincts  took over.   Ranma wrapped  his arms  around his  long-lost  teddy, rolled  to his  side, while  sliding her  a bit  lower and  resting his  chin on  top of  her head.</p><p>Thus,  Kasumi found  herself in  a bit  of a  predicament. Not  only was  she still  recovering from  the remains  of her  adrenalin rush,  Kasumi also  found herself...Kasumi  found herself  flushed and  excited from  being held  so intimately  by Ranma,  and she  was still  feeling the  heat from  when Ranma  inadvertently ground  their bodies  together during  the process  of shifting  her into  "teddy-bear"  position. Kasumi  was partially  worried about  Nodoka's  reaction, as  she didn't  want to  give Ranma's  mother any  more material  to torment  herself and  Ranma with.   The rest  of her  was happy,  content, and  almost ready  to ignore  the rest  of the  world; to  fall asleep  in Ranma's  arms. After  a brief  internal battle,  Kasumi's  worries, with  the aid  of that  little nagging  voice saying  "this is  improper", finally  won out.   She started  whispering to  Ranma as  loud as  she dared,  still not  wanting to  risk waking  Nodoka.</p><p>Ranma,  being the  heavy sleeper  he was,  remained oblivious  as she  tried to  struggle and  whisper to  him. He  merely continued  to hold  her, and  slept on.</p><p>Kasumi,  on the  other hand,  nearly let  out a  moan, her  body betraying  her thanks  to all  of the  sensations generated  by the  level of  physical contact.   She stopped  moving because  it was  becoming more  and more  difficult to  think straight  and remember  why she  wanted to  get out  of Ranma's  embrace. But  remember she  did, and  for a  few more  minutes Kasumi  continued urgently  whispering to  Ranma, while  at the  same time  trying not  to become  more aroused.</p><p>"-Gasp-  I knew you two would need the bigger sleeping bag!" came an  excited but quiet voice.</p><p>Kasumi  wanted to  cry, or  at least  whimper. This  is exactly  what she  wanted to  avoid. She  was afraid  to look  up, knowing,  almost fearing,  what she'd  find, the  suffering both  she and  Ranma were  guaranteed to  endure. Gathering  her courage,  she tilted  her head  up, finding  the very  thing that  she knew  would be  there. There  Nodoka stood,  towering over  herself and  Ranma, a  slightly glazed  look in  her eyes  and a  wide smile  that seemed  to fill  her face.   Kasumi was  becoming irritated,  not only  had her  body betrayed  her and  become aroused,  but her  mind had  become a  jumbled mess  of conflicting  emotions. She  decided, then  and there,  to vent  her frustration  on the  target of  her greatest  frustration: her  maybe future  mother-in-law.   The only  problem was,  since she  was currently  confined by  Ranma's  hold, all  she could  do was  tilt her  head towards  Nodoka and  glare.</p><p>Nodoka,  noticing she  was being  glared at,  came to  the conclusion  that Kasumi  was telling  her to  leave and  let them  sleep in  together. Nodoka  nodded to  Kasumi's  unspoken, and  grossly misinterpreted,  request.</p><p>Kasumi  watched as  Nodoka's  smile grew  a bit  wider as  she nodded  her assent,  and left.   As soon  as Nodoka  left, Kasumi  was absolutely  confused by  Nodoka's  actions. That  little bit  of confusion  almost caused  Kasumi to  forget she  was practically  molded to  Ranma's  body. Kasumi  mentally groaned/moaned.</p><p>'To  heck with it! Nodoka saw us, I might as well enjoy it as much as I  can.' was Kasumi's last thought as she made herself comfortable in  Ranma's arms. Now feeling only reassurance and safety, Kasumi  quickly fell back to sleep.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"AHHHHH!  I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"<p>That  was the  first thing  Kasumi heard  upon waking,  but not  the first  thing she  felt. An  instant before  Ranma's  incoherent shout  and string  of apologies,  Kasumi's  head had  hit the  floor when  her nice,  firm, pillow  decided to  teleport to  the other  side of  the room.   Kasumi sat  up and  blinked a  couple of  times, looked  at Ranma  then blinked  some more.   When she  realized Ranma  was bracing  himself to  be hit,  she frowned.   'What did  Ranma do  to get  hit so  many times  that this  has become  an automatic  response,' Wondered  Kasumi as  she stood  up and  made her  way over  to Ranma.   As she  moved closer  to Ranma  and watched  him cringe  with each  step she  took, Kasumi  was finding  it more  and more  difficult to  not badmouth  the people  in Nerima  that conditioned  Ranma to  be like  this. When  she reached  him she  took both  of his  hands in  hers.</p><p>"I'm  not going to hit you, Ranma. Calm down. I won't hit you."  Kasumi said to Ranma in the softest and most calming voice she could.</p><p>Ranma  heard Kasumi  and stopped  apologizing, but  still had  his arms  in front  of his  face. From  behind his  arms he  opened his  eyes.</p><p>"Huh?   Why not? It was my fault." Ranma said with almost enough  conviction to convince Kasumi.</p><p>"What?"  Kasumi spoke in her gentle but now confused voice.</p><p>"Waking  up with you in my arms...I'm sorry for taking advantage of you!"  Ranma's voice was now a bit muffled because he was on his knees  bowing to Kasumi.</p><p>"It  was not your fault." Kasumi continued in her gentle voice, "It  was my fault."</p><p>"Huh!"</p><p>"I  woke up to do some chores for the morning, but I got my feet tangled  in my sleeping bag and fell... umm... on you." A blush slowly  grew on her face as she recalled her little adventure earlier this  morning, "If you hadn't caught me this morning I might have been  hurt."</p><p>"Oh  good!" Ranma sighed in relief "Umm... I have a question  though."</p><p>"What?"  Kasumi asked. She smiled a bit at seeing Ranma dropped his guard.</p><p>"When  you fell on me why didn't you just get off?"</p><p>Kasumi  shivered at  the memory  of Ranma's  arms around  her. "You  wrapped your  arms around  me, so  I was...  stuck." Kasumi  paused then  continued, anticipating  Ranma's  next question,  "I tried  to wake  you, but  I couldn't,  and it  was... well...really  comfortable, so  I kind  of fell  back to  sleep."</p><p>Ranma  smiled and  responded before  he realized  what was  being said,  "It felt  really good  holding you."</p><p>As  soon as  both of  them realized  what was  just said,  both of  their eyes'  widened and  they both  turned to  study their  feet. Having  nothing to  say, both  settled into  an uncomfortable  silence. Idly,  Kasumi pondered  why it  was that  she had  been embarrassed  and blushed  more in  a few  days than  she had  in her  entire life  prior to  leaving with  Ranma. Was  it that  some goddess  had decided  that she  spent too  much time  serving her  family and  had not  been through  enough of  the trials  and situations  a normal  girl would?   She paused  at that  thought, she  had never  been a  normal girl;  she never  could be,  that chance  was given  up when  she had  to take  over the  mother role  in the  Tendo household  after her  mother's  death. Kasumi  could not  say that  she hated  it; in  fact, she  loved it,  but in  the past  two days  she had  acted closer  to her  age then  she had  in the  ten years  previous. Kasumi's  little introspective  was disturbed  when Nodoka  made her  presence known.</p><p>"Kasumi,  why did you wake up so early this morning to do chores, when this is  not even your home? Do you think that I'm such a poor hostess that I  couldn't take care of my own home?" Nodoka asked in a harsh  tone. She had apparently overheard their entire conversation from  the kitchen.</p><p>"No,  no...I... I was..." Kasumi was stumbling over her words as a bit  of shame wash over her as she took in Nodoka's words.</p><p>Ranma  was about  to come  to Kasumi's  defense, but  Nodoka shot  him a  glare that  stopped any  outward protest  that he  had.</p><p>"I...I  thought that I was still back at the dojo, and I was only getting up  to do chores, like I have been for the last ten years. I just forgot  that I was... wasn't there anymore." Kasumi finished with her  head down in defeat.</p><p>Nodoka  walked around  the kitchen  counter and  into the  living room,  where Kasumi  stood, looking  meek, and  enveloped the  younger girl  in a  hug. "Kasumi,  I know  what you  had to  do for  the last  ten years.   I also  know that  in those  ten years  you have  never had  a chance  to just  be a  girl. I  can take  care of  the house;  all I  want is  for you  and Ranma  to be  like carefree  teenagers, and  enjoy your  newfound relationship.   Okay?"</p><p>"Okay."  Kasumi's reply was muffled as she embraced Nodoka a bit harder,  relishing in the feeling she thought she would never feel again, and  had nearly forgotten, a mother's love for her daughter.</p><p>At  first, Ranma  didn't  understand what  his mother  was trying  to do,  but after  he heard  to his  mother's  words, he  understood. He  figured that  his mother  was trying  to get  Kasumi to  stop being  a substitute  mother and  be more  of a  girl. He  decided to  give them  a bit  of privacy,  and went  into the  kitchen to  watch over  breakfast, giving  his mother  and Kasumi  the opportunity  to bond.</p><p>"Now  I know that there isn't much for a young couple to do out here, but  there are a few things, and when you finish with those we'll find  something else. For today, I made a picnic basket for the two of  you. I'll give you directions to an open field and you and Ranma can  go on a picnic." Nodoka said after releasing Kasumi from their  hug.</p><p>"Is  this a plan to let me be alone with him so I could seduce him and  have my way with him for hours and hours?" Kasumi asked, almost  in a monotone, rolling her eyes, she figured she knew what Nodoka had  planned.</p><p>"Oh  My... What a wonderful idea!" Nodoka gushed, "Oh, I think  there are some energy drinks in the refrigerator. I know you two  will need them."</p><p>Kasumi  just stood  there frozen  as she  thought 'That  look on  Nodoka's  face was  too real.   I don't  think she  thought of  that. Why  do I  have the  feeling I  just dug  my own  grave?' She  groaned and  covered her  face with  her hands.</p><p>Ranma  came over  and asked,  "What did  you do  to mom?   She seems  really happy."</p><p>Kasumi  decided to  peek through  her fingers  and saw  Nodoka practically  skipping all  over the  kitchen. "I  was only  being sarcastic!"</p><p>Nodoka  stopped in  mid skip  and looked  over at  Kasumi, "That  was cruel;  you shouldn't  mess with  this young  woman's  heart like  that!"</p><p>Kasumi's  mouth decided  to give  evidence that  Ranma's  foot-in-the-mouth  disease may  very well  be contagious,  "You seem  like you're  senile and  old to  me."</p><p>Ranma's  own disease  not wanting  to be  out done  added, "You're  not as  old as  the old  ghoul, but  you have  to be  at least  40, or  something. That's  still really  old!"</p><p>Nodoka  pressed her  back to  one of  the taller  cabinets and  dramatically crossed  her hands  over her  heart. "Oh  the cruelty,  how can  my children  be so  heartless!" Nodoka  then turned  her head  so it  looked like  she was  trying to  turn it  away from  Ranma and  Kasumi, but  left enough  of her  face visible  to allow  the other  two to  see a  lone crocodile  tear roll  down her  cheek.</p><p>Kasumi,  who had  lowered her  head once  again, was  about to  apologize for  her comment,  looked up  at Nodoka  and rolled  her eyes  again. She  then looked  at Ranma,  only to  see that  her naive  and innocent  Ranma had  fallen for  his mother's  little performance,  and was  about to  move over  to comfort  his mother.   Kasumi shook  her head  and grabbed  Ranma's  arm, dragging  him up  the stairs  to get  ready for  the day.</p><p>When  the two  came back  Nodoka, no  longer feeling  melodramatic, had  breakfast set  out and  ready to  eat. Breakfast  passed uneventfully  with little  more than  idle chatter  being exchanged.   When they  finished, Nodoka  got up  and handed  the basket  to Kasumi.</p><p>"Mom?"  Ranma asked, getting Nodoka's attention.</p><p>"Yes,  Ranma." Nodoka said as she turned to regard her son.</p><p>"You  could come with us." Ranma asked.</p><p>"Not  today Ranma, I'm going to check around the house today and see if  there's anything that still needs to be done."</p><p>"We  could help. I've been taking care of a home for so long that it's  going to be hard for me to stop." Kasumi spoke. She didn't want  Nodoka doing this all by herself.</p><p>"Hmm...if  you really want to stop that habit, you could go with your earlier  suggestion to me. I know that my son would be more than willing to  help you." Nodoka beamed back with a look in her eyes that  could only mean she was thinking about grandchildren.</p><p>In  response, Kasumi  only slightly  blushed, a  sign that  she might  have been  getting used  to Nodoka's  twisted sense  of humor.</p><p>Ranma  chose that  moment to  interrupt their  conversation, "Sure,  I'll  help her.   I'll  help all  day if  she wants."</p><p>'All  day...' When Kasumi heard that her head filled with images that  should only have been in doujinshi. She silently cursed her  suppressed sex drive, and tried to guess what would happen if Ranma  was to really try to bed her. This brought up many images most  people would have thought impossible to find going through the mind  of sweet and innocent Kasumi.</p><p>"Kasumi?"  Ranma's voice woke her from her fantasy.</p><p>"Huh?"  was Kasumi's awe-inspiring reply.</p><p>"Uhh...what  are you doing?" Ranma asked while glancing at Kasumi's body and  coloring.</p><p>A  bit confused  at Ranma's  reaction, Kasumi  glanced down  to see  her hand  just barely  hovering over  her skin.   Her left  hand was  over her  left breast,  and the  right was  nearly on  her panties.   Ripping her  hands to  her side,  she tried  to come  up with  an answer.   "I was  err...umm...scratching."  she finished  lamely.</p><p>"It  looked like you were about to..." began Nodoka's ever-so-helpful  voice. The only problem was, she was never given the chance to  finish, because Kasumi took that moment to grab the picnic basket,  grab Ranma, and take off at a speed that impressed Ranma. Ranma  would have commented, but he was to busy acting like a silk cloth as  he was being dragged through the wind. When Kasumi was out of  hearing range of the house, she stopped to catch her breath and  looked back. There was Nodoka, waving good-bye to them and wearing  the same insufferable smirk that Ranma usually wore during a fight.</p><p>"Kasumi,  maybe we should go back? I mean, mom might have had something  important to say, and we didn't get the directions to the clearing  she was talking about." Ranma questioned as Kasumi tried to  catch her breath.</p><p>After  a few  more moments  of heavy  breathing, Kasumi  finally replied,  "I don't  think it  was that  important, because  she's  waving at  us. We  don't  really need  directions... we  could just  pick a  direction and  go; eventually,  we'll  find to  a place  where we  can eat."</p><p>"If  you say so..." Ranma reluctantly agreed with Kasumi</p><p>With  that, the  two picked  a direction,  and started  walking. No  words were  exchanged as  they walked;  no words  were needed,  being at  each others'  side was  enough. The  silence didn't  stop the  two from  looking around  and admiring  the beautiful  forest around  them.</p><p>Although,  Ranma had  been sneaking  more peeks  at Kasumi  then at  the scenery  around them.   Every time  he looked  at her  he felt  he was  dreaming and  had to  constantly remind  himself that  this was  no dream,  and she  truly was  here with  him. He  no longer  felt the  crippling constraints  his father  forced on  to him.   Here he  was, free,  free to  make his  own future,  a future  together with  Kasumi.</p><p>Kasumi,  on the  other hand,  was amazed  at the  natural beauty  surrounding her.   She had  seen pictures  of mesmerizing  forests and  other landscapes,  but to  be in  the middle  of one  was infinitely  better. She  had been  to other  forests and  even a  tropical island,  but all  of those  times she  was still  bound by  the responsibility  of taking  care of  her family.   Here, those  shackles were  ripped away.  Here, she  could just  enjoy herself,  with none  of the  suffocating responsibilities  waiting in  the background.   She was  here with  Ranma, and  that was  all that  truly mattered  in her  eyes. After  an hour  of walking,  the two  came across  a meadow  with a  small brook  flowing into  a small  pond. The  two had  come to  a stop  at the  top of  a hill  overlooking the  entire valley.   Kasumi stood  a few  steps in  front of  Ranma, watching  the small  breezes as  they danced  along the  tops of  the long  grass, creating  an almost  water-like  effect, and  in the  treetops as  they rustled  the leaves  to add  yet more  movement and  sound, as  if completing  the illusion  of Kasumi's  fantasy. A  fantasy that  was now  no longer  a fantasy.   Ranma ignored  everything around  himself, so  focused he  was on  Kasumi, and  the way  her hair  swayed behind  her in  the gentle  breeze. Her  features made  known her  wonderment as  she took  in the  sight before  her; a  graceful, yet  childlike, smile  graced her  lips. Ranma  could only  smile, himself,  as Kasumi's  entire being  seemed aglow  with joy.</p><p>"Beautiful."  was all Kasumi said in a light, feathery voice.</p><p>"Yea..."  Ranma replied, still mesmerized by Kasumi.</p><p>"Thank  You, Ranma." Kasumi said, now shifting her gaze to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma  had just  realized she  was close  enough, and  was at  an angle  which made  it easy  for her  to see  him. Ranma  had been  so enraptured  by her  beauty that  he hadn't  actually cared  what she  was doing,  and didn't  notice her  sneaking little  peeks at  him the  entire time...  until she  had thanked  him, that  is. "GAAKK!"</p><p>Ranma  instinctively cringed  waiting to  be crushed  by a  huge mallet.   He quickly  realized that  Akane was  not there,  and Kasumi  had told  him earlier  that she  wouldn't  hit him.  "You really  are very  beautiful." Ranma  said in  a stronger  voice, to  reaffirm that  he wouldn't  be punished,  and to  tell Kasumi  how he  felt.</p><p>"Like  I said, thank you. Now come on." Not giving Ranma a chance to  reply, she took his hand started to walk down the hill, towards a  lone tree in the middle of the meadow, near the pond. When they  reached the tree, Ranma proceeded to lay out the picnic blanket,  while Kasumi decided to explore the area. Ranma had just finished  putting out the blanket when he heard a giggle from Kasumi. Getting  a bewildered look on his face, he looked at Kasumi, who was looking  towards him.</p><p>"Ranma  come here!" Kasumi yelled. She had an infectious grin and  looked like she was trying to hold back laughter.</p><p>"What?"  Ranma asked while smiling. Although, he didn't know why Kasumi was  smiling, all he knew was that it made him feel warm inside.</p><p>"Look."  Kasumi said pointing to the tree.</p><p>Nodoka's  son looked  at the  tree, and  the message  inscribed in  the trunk.  "This place  belongs to  Nodoka Inoue  and to  all trespassers  you will  die a  slow and  very painful  death by  Q-tip!   If this  is Onii-tama  it was  Onee-sama's  fault. If  this is  Onee-sama  it was  Onii-tama's  fault." Ranma  chuckled.</p><p>"You  know, somehow, I knew that mom was almost as big of a trouble maker  as I was." Ranma laughed after his comment.</p><p>Kasumi  rolled her  eyes and  sarcastically asked,  "Whatever gave  you that  idea?"</p><p>Ranma  went back  make sure  the picnic  blanket was  secure while  Kasumi continued  her exploration  of the  area. When  Ranma finished,  he was  about to  go join  Kasumi, but  got a  better idea  and walked  to the  nearest flower  patch. After  a few  minutes of  wandering, Kasumi  noticed Ranma  sitting in  a flower  patch. Kasumi  blinked a  couple of  times at  Ranma's  bizarre behavior  and, wondering  why Ranma  was acting  so strange,  warily tiptoed  up to  Ranma.</p><p>"Ranma,  what are you doing." Kasumi asked cautiously.</p><p>"This  one is making a crown for my princess." Ranma said. He stood up  and turned around holding a coronet made of white wild flowers, with  a single blue flower on the front. He placed the crown atop  Kasumi's head and deeply bowed. "I hope it is to your liking."</p><p>"Thank  you, my young knight. It is a wonderful gift." Kasumi giggled.  "You shame me. This is such a wonderful gift that you have  given me, and yet you've given me no chance to give you anything in  return."</p><p>"My  lady the only gift I need from you is your smile; for your smile, no  gift on earth or even heaven is an equal." Ranma continued with  their little play.</p><p>"Thank  you Ranma. How did learn how to make these? I know for certain that  learning to make a flower circlet was not part of learning martial  arts." Kasumi said stopping their role-play.</p><p>Ranma  had first  turned away  as if  insulted, and  then spoke.   "Anything Goes  Martial Arts  Flower Arranging."</p><p>Kasumi  just gawked.</p><p>"...I  lied."</p><p>Kasumi  face faulted.</p><p>"I  don't think you should do that, it looks like it hurts." Ranma  said, looking at Kasumi's face, which was now firmly planted in the  ground.</p><p>'Oww!'  Kasumi thought, 'I should have figured that something was up when he  turned away.'</p><p>Ranma  just laughed  at Kasumi,  which only  caused her  to glare  at him.   He then  sat down,  cross-legged,  so he  was near  eye-level  with Kasumi.   "So, want  me to  teach you?"</p><p>Kasumi  wanted to  say no  and glare  at him  some more,  but she  realized Ranma  was being  more open,  and showing  that he  was more  than a  dumb jock.   So, for  the moment,  she decided  to let  him get  away with  the trick  he'd  pulled on  her, for  now. She  lifted her  head and  replied, "Sure,  but could  you at  least tell  me how  you learned?"</p><p>"Alright."  Ranma paused, as if remembering, "It was a couple of weeks  before I went to the all boys school I met Ryoga at. Genma had left  me for a couple days, and I was bored. I started to walk in a  different direction from the camp to kill time. On one of those  random walks I ended up in a valley, much like this one, where I met  a ten year old girl. She had seen me and called me over before I  could leave and, since training had gotten a bit tedious, I went to  talk to the girl. It turned out that she often came to the place to  play, and couldn't play with any of her friends at the time, so I  played with her until she had to go. But before she left, she taught  me how to make a flower bracelet. The crown I made you was just a  bigger version of the bracelet."</p><p>"So  what do I do first?" Now that Kasumi's curiosity was satisfied,  she wanted to learn how to make a bracelet.</p><p>Ranma  spent the  next twenty  minutes explaining,  and showing,  Kasumi how  to make  one. Kasumi's  first attempt  hadn't  quite come  out as  she had  intended.</p><p>"Wow,  this is great. You have to teach me how to make ones like these. I  mean I know how to make one in the shape of a circle really well, but  I didn't even know that they could be made in a star shape."  Ranma paused in admiration of Kasumi's creation, "Kasumi are you  okay? You look kind of red... We could go back if you're not  feeling well."</p><p>Kasumi's  only response  was to  wish she  could crawl  under a  rock and  hide.</p><p>Over  the next  hour Kasumi  figured out  how to  make a  circular one.   Ranma was  annoyed though  - Kasumi wouldn't  teach him  how to  make the  star shape  - but in  Kasumi's  defense, you  can't  teach what  you don't  know.</p><p>When  Kasumi finally  understood how  to make  the flower  bracelet, she  began to  make them  in all  different sizes.   At the  end of  the hour  Ranma had  six rings,  his own  crown, three  bracelets, two  anklets, and  a hula-hoop.</p><p>"Uhh...don't  you think this is enough, Kasumi?" Ranma asked, looking like a  wild flower garden.</p><p>"Not  yet, I have to make some more for the house." said Kasumi, who  was busy picking another flower.</p><p>"If  you make some for the house, it's going to make a big mess when they  dry up and crumble, a mess that we'll have to clean up. Uhh... and I  don't think that there will be any more flowers around here if you  keep going."</p><p>"What  do you mean? There are still lots of flowers around here."  Kasumi looked around herself and noticed that she was now nearly  surrounded by a small desert, "Eh he he...umm...I think its  time we ate lunch."</p><p>"Sure."  He stood up and faced Kasumi. What he did next made absolutely no  sense to Kasumi. He bowed his head and clapped his hands twice.</p><p>"Thank  you, Ranma." Kasumi was still confused at Ranma's actions.</p><p>"Oh  that wasn't for you. That was for all of the poor innocent flowers  you killed." Ranma gave her one of his arrogant smirks and  started to jog away.</p><p>Kasumi  flushed and  gave chase.   Right when  she was  about to  catch him  he leaped  away. "Hey!  That's  not fair!"</p><p>Ranma's  retort was  to spin  around in  midair and  stick his  tongue out.</p><p>Kasumi  smiled, and  shook her  head, at  Ranma's  behavior. Figuring  Ranma would  not start  eating without  her, she  walked at  a leisurely  pace to  Nodoka's  tree. Only  ten minutes  had passed  when she  saw Ranma  soaring at  her in  mid leap.   She kept  walking and  as she  expected Ranma  landed right  in front  of her.   He looked  at her  in a  questioning manner.   She just  smiled and  leaned closer  to him,  which prompted  him to  start sweating  at the  sweet look  that he  was receiving.   Once she  was sure  that Ranma  was only  looking at  her face,  her hand  snuck up  and flicked  him on  the nose.   Ranma jerked  his nose  away from  Kasumi as  she spoke.   "You weren't  very nice  teasing me  like that."</p><p>Ranma  then smirked.   "So you  don't  like me  teasing you,  huh?"</p><p>Kasumi's  smile faltered  a bit.   She didn't  like that  smirk. It  wasn't  his normal  smirk, it  was...more  sinister. "Ranma,  what are  you  !"</p><p>Ranma  had scooped  Kasumi up  with one  arm on  her back  and the  other behind  her knees,  and jumped  towards the  forest. Kasumi  felt the  sensations of  rising and  falling but  was too  frightened to  open her  eyes... that,  and Ranma's  chest was  really comfortable.   Once they  had stopped  falling, and  stayed still  for a  few seconds,  Kasumi opened  her eyes  and looked  around. What  she saw  was breathtaking.   They were  looking down  at the  valley. The  sun was  shining down  on everything,  casting shadows  on the  valley, and  making the  water glitter.   It was  a completely  different view  from this  morning; it  made the  whole place  look more  enticing.</p><p>"Ranma  if you ever do that to me again without warning me, I'll..."  Kasumi looked up to find that the sinister smirk was now joined by a  sinister gleam in his eyes. 'I don't think that I like that look.'  was Kasumi's last thought before she saw Ranma glance down. Going  against her better judgment, she looked down... to see that they  were standing on a thick branch above a thirty meter cliff. She  didn't have a good feeling about this. "Ranma..." and they  fell "...!" Kasumi  instinctively pulled herself closer to Ranma and squeezed her eyes  shut. When they stopped, the eldest Tendo daughter cautiously opened  one eye, only to see Ranma's insufferable smirk above her. Opening  both her eyes and looking around, she saw that Ranma was safely on  the ground, she was still in his arms, and not on the ground herself.   Glaring at Ranma, whose smirk only got wider; she gave him the first  suitable punishment that came to mind. "I will never cook for  you ever again."</p><p>After  hearing that,  it was  Ranma's  turn to  have his  smile waver,  but it  quickly returned  looking more  confident. "Really?"</p><p>"Yes!"  was the forceful reply from Kasumi.</p><p>"Why?"  Ranma said with a clueless look.</p><p>"Cause  you let me fall!" Kasumi looked at him like he grew a second  head.</p><p>"Do  you think I would let you fall?"</p><p>The  question made  Kasumi pause.   "Well...no.   Not if  I could  get hurt."</p><p>"See?   You were safe the entire time." Ranma replied.</p><p>"But  it was still scary"</p><p>"Open  your eyes and watch, it's actually really fun! Trust me." Ranma  said with a soft and genuine smile.</p><p>"...Okay..."  Kasumi still had a bit of apprehension in her voice as she spoke.</p><p>Kasumi's  anxiety quickly  left her  as she  relished the  wind in  her face,  along with  the safety  and comfort  she felt  while being  cradled in  Ranma's  arms. Kasumi  was very  disappointed when  they had  to stop,  but understood  why when  Ranma's  stomach let  off a  roar, not  a growl,  but an  actual deafening  roar. She  wasn't  sure, but  she thought  she heard  an echo.   Much to  Ranma's  embarrassment, the  two decided  to stop  for lunch.   They ate  in silence,  which was  mostly due  to Ranma's  mouth never  being empty  for more  then a  second. When  they finished  eating, both  felt extremely  tired and  drowsy and  started to  fall asleep.   Ranma, wanting  Kasumi to  be comfortable,  used the  flowers he  had been  wearing to  make a  pillow for  Kasumi. Kasumi  was too  sleepy to  protest, and  let herself  be pampered  by Ranma.   Soon enough  the two  were asleep  on the  blanket, being  warmed by  sunlight.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka  had wanted  to go  with her  son and  Kasumi, but,  as she  had told  Kasumi earlier,  she was  the mistress  of the  house so  she had  duties here  to attend  to. She  went through  every room  and obsessively  cleaned everything  until the  room looked  like it  had just  been built.   She had  a quick  lunch before  deciding to  take the  opportunity for  a long  soak. After  that, she  really didn't  have anything  to do,  so she  decide to  have some  tea outside  and relax  some more.   After an  hour or  so outside,  she decided  to start  dinner and  wait for  her son  and future  daughter's  return.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  woke up  about an  hour after  he had  fallen asleep.   He had  been awakened  by a  rather cool  gust of  wind, and  had also  heard sounds  of someone  moving near  him. He  sat up  and glanced  to his  right and  saw Kasumi  had curled  herself into  a ball  to try  warding off  the cold.   Seeing as  he wouldn't  be able  to fall  asleep again,  he folded  his half  of the  blanket over  Kasumi. After  watching for  Kasumi to  stop shivering,  he moved  away from  her and  started to  do some  katas. A  little over  an hour  later, he  was so  focused on  his workout  he failed  to notice  Kasumi was  up and  watching him,  with an  enraptured gaze.   She watched  every movement  of Ranma's  lithe and  powerful form.   In Kasumi's  eyes, the  art was  no longer  the violent  tool that  she always  witnessed in  Nerima. People  who used  unarmed combat,  like Ranma,  are the  reason why  it was  called an  art. It  had nothing  to do  with his  hard, well  defined, muscle  that rippled  deliciously when  he moved.  Nope, those  glistening muscles  had nothing  to do  with it,  nothing at  all. After  another 2  hours of  drooling...er...watching  him practice,  Ranma ended  his routine  and saw  Kasumi was  up and  watching him.   Ranma smiled  and stared  walking towards  her.<p>"Did  you sleep well?" Ranma kneeled so he could speak to her without  having to look down.</p><p>"Yeah."  Kasumi's couldn't help but let her eyes wander over his body since  his sweat-drenched clothes stuck to him like a second skin. Her show  was interrupted when Ranma stood up, extending a hand to help her to  her feet. Taking his hand she pulled herself up. "Thank you."</p><p>"You're  welcome. We should be going back; mom will probably have dinner  ready soon." Ranma didn't let go of her hand when she tried to  pull away. Kasumi cast a quizzical look at Ranma, and though he  couldn't meet her eyes, he mumbled, "It feels nice."</p><p>Understanding  Ranma's  unvoiced question,  Kasumi tightened  her hold  on his  hand. Together  the two  cleaned their  things up  and walked  back, hand  in hand.   When the  two reached  the Inoue  house they  saw Nodoka  fluttering about  the kitchen,  already started  on dinner.   The two  offered to  help, but  were quickly  and forcefully  asked to  go up  stairs and  get cleaned  up. When  Ranma and  Kasumi had  returned from  their baths,  dinner was  ready and  set to  be served.   Dinner was  fairly animated  as Kasumi  told Nodoka  about their  day and  what they  did. Of  course, she  omitted some  parts and  certain thoughts,  but tale  was still  accurate. After  dinner had  ended and  the three  had cleaned  up, Ranma  walked to  the wall  surrounding their  new home  and sat  on one  of the  fallen trees  in the  yard. It  was only  a few  minutes later  when Kasumi  and his  mother followed  him.</p><p>"Ranma,  do you mind if we join you?" Kasumi held her hands behind her  back and wore a delicate smile. After seeing him nod his consent,  Kasumi sat to his right and Nodoka sat to his left.</p><p>"What  are you doing out here?" Nodoka asked, watching her son as he  stared at nothing.</p><p>"Just  came outside so I could think." Ranma said, looking at the  darkening sunset.</p><p>"If  you want, we could leave you alone?" Nodoka asked, but as both  women stood up to leave, Ranma's hands darted out and grasped both of  them by a wrist.</p><p>"Please  stay!" Ranma spoke a bit louder than he had intended, but  continued anyway, the tone of his voice making him sound weary,  "Could you just listen for now?"</p><p>"Always."  was the strong reply from Kasumi's concerned voice.</p><p>Ranma  took a  calming breath  and began  express his  thoughts, "You  know, I've  been acting  so different  these last  two days.   I mean  look what  I did.   Who would  have thought,  without any  magic, potions  or blackmail  that I  would be  flirting and  teasing Kasumi  like..."</p><p>"...a  normal boy?" his mother finished for him.</p><p>"Well...yeah.   I never knew or thought that I could do anything normal." Ranma  said, looking depressed.</p><p>"Ranma,  I'm not the only one with a mask." Ranma looked at Kasumi in  confusion. She wouldn't meet his eyes and had her head down.</p><p>"Wha?"  was the only word that came out of his mouth as he struggled to  figure out what she meant.</p><p>"A  little over a week ago, you said that I hide behind a mask."  Kasumi still didn't want to meet Ranma's eyes, especially when he  realized what she was talking about.</p><p>It  was a  few moments  after she  spoke that  he figured  out what  she meant.   Once he  did, his  body stiffened,  his face  colored and  his eyes  widened. "Yo...you  heard that?"  his voiced  wavered as  he spoke.</p><p>"Yes..."  Kasumi still had not moved.</p><p>"So,  I confessed to you without knowing..."</p><p>To  Kasumi his  voice sounded  a bit  muffled. She  was about  to reply,  but Nodoka  started to  laugh. Startled,  Kasumi turned  to see  Nodoka wave  her hands  toward her  son. Kasumi  stifled a  giggle herself  as she  watched Ranma  crawl under  a couple  of boulders  behind them.</p><p>"Ranma  stop that. Come back here!" Kasumi spun herself around as she  got off the log. Taking a couple steps, she managed to grab one of  Ranma's ankles and tried to drag him back to where they were sitting.   "Come on."</p><p>Ranma,  seeing that  he was  no longer  moving, looked  back and  saw Kasumi  attached to  his foot.   For a  moment, he  entertained the  idea of  dragging her  under the  rock with  him, but  it felt  like too  much work.   Instead, he  went limp,  content to  let Kasumi  drag him  back. Of  course, Kasumi  wasn't  strong enough  to drag  him on  her own,  and gave  up after  a couple  of tugs.   Instead, she  wrapped her  arm around  his waist  and started  pulling. Sighing,  he gave  up, stood  up, and  sagged against  Kasumi, who  pulled him  back and  sat him  down. As  she began  to sit,  she caught  Ranma cracking  a smile.   Once he  was settled  again, he  started to  speak.</p><p>"If  we were back in Nerima, I would never have toyed around with anyone  like that." Ranma had a bitter edge to his voice.</p><p>"As  I was saying, I'm not the only one with a mask. I am very sure that  if you had done something like that in Nerima, the results would have  been disastrous." Kasumi continued speaking her thoughts from  before Ranma had interrupted. "I know that the clueless martial  arts jock that was in Nerima was only an act. There were many times  I saw proof it was an act, especially in the last few days."</p><p>"What  if... what you saw these last few days wasn't really me?" A hint  of fear now entering his voice. 'Maybe she only likes me the way  I've been acting the last two days. What if that's not me? What if I  really am that dumb jock? Would she stop caring for me?'</p><p>"I  wouldn't care. If this is you, or the Ranma I've watched these last  couple years is the real you. I don't care. As long as you are you,  I'll happily stay by your side."</p><p>"I  don't care", she says.' Such simple words, but to Ranma it meant  so much. 'She isn't demanding that I be anything other than what I  am... All she expects is for me to be myself.' To him, it felt like  the world had been lifted off his shoulders, he could grow to be  himself and it wouldn't disappoint Kasumi. 'And she's the first  person who hasn't told me what to be... the first person who doesn't  want to change me, or control me... '</p><p>Kasumi's  smile grew  a bit  wider, happy  that her  words had  calmed the  internal turmoil  that Ranma  seemed to  be going  through.</p><p>Nodoka  was now  realizing that  her children  were very  strong emotionally  and mentally,  but like  almost all  young couples,  still had  insecurities that  they were  afraid to  confront. Hopefully  she could  let them  have enough  time alone,  without the  distractions of  the past  coming back  and haunting  them, so  they could  find and  overcome those  insecurities.</p><p>The  rest of  the night  was spent  near each  other, a  newly found  peace the  three were  quickly finding  to be  addictive.</p><p>Author's  Notes: My  laptop died  and I  lost everything,  and yet  I got  this chapter written faster  then the  last, for  some reason  I find  that odd.   As always I would like to thank my pre-readers: Drkjester and DelShalDar. Anyways, as  always, you  can leave  a review  or e-mail  me a  comment at:</p><p>tsunami(underscore)saotome(at)yahoo(dot)com</p><p>Reviewer  Responses:</p><p>I  would like  to thank  every one  else who  reviewed and  say that  I will  update as  soon as  I feel  that I  have something  that is  worth people  using their  time to  read.</p><p>Wonderbee31:  Thank you.   I'll  deal with  everyone eventually.   I'm  going to  try to  be a  bit different  from the  norm (don't  know if  I can  though.). So  please keep  reading and  let me  know what  you think.</p><p>Darkepton:  Not finishing  a story  was the  main reason  that I  almost never  started or  uploaded a  story. I  don't  know what  the future  holds but  I will  try to  finish every  story I  put out.</p><p>Reaper2040:   I'm  happy you  think that  my story  is good.   The length  of my  chapters may  vary because  I usually  have to  or three  events planed  that I  want to  cover in  a chapter  and I  write till  I cover  them.</p><p>a:  I have  a scene  to deal  with his  name but  I have  to figure  out how  it's  going to  affect the  other stuff  that I  have planned  out.</p><p>Shinji  the good  sharer: sweat  drops thanks...you  know I  think reading  your stories  is staring  to corrupt  my pure  and oh  so innocent  mind.</p><p>Crimson  Yrael: I  love Ranma/Kasumi  match-ups  too! I  do try  and hand  each scene  with care.  I always  try to  write so  that anyone  who chooses  to read  my story  can enjoy  it.</p><p>Oh  and flames  will be  tossed into  Akane's  cooking. Then  when they're  alive, they  will be  force fed  her cooking  to die  a slow,  painful death.</p>
