</div><p>Prologue: What Came To Pass</p><p>War was coming to the village of  Yarrow. The traders, traveling between the myriad villages that  populated this region of what was once known as the state of  Washington, had been bringing word of it for months, word carried from  the south and east of what was called North America, and now called  divided up into villages, and city-states and petty fiefdoms.  Information was hard to come by these days, and was usually badly  distorted after a few tellings, but when so many rumors all claimed the  same thing, the village elders knew that it was most likely the truth.  Indisputably, War was coming.</p><p>A rider had barreled through the  center of town only moments before, bellowing that the first  distortions had been seen on the horizon. There was, apparently, no  weapons fire yet, although that would inevitably come. Across Yarrow,  parents quietly tucked away their children into the dugout shelters  underneath their homes, shouldered their own weapons, and went out to  meet the invaders. The elders looked on sadly, having themselves an  inkling of the futility of resistance. Some among their number could  remember the tales of their grandfathers, of when the word 'War' meant  the clash of armies; great masses of troops coming into conflict,  tearing each other asunder. Or, more recently, of when it meant The  Great War, the war between the gods, when the old order of the world  fell and left as survivors only those tough enough to endure the  hardships of life in a disintegrating world. Those of the younger  generations, though, they only knew these tales second or third hand.  They were not real; not in the way that the rain and the sun and the  great Sound were.</p><p>In these days, War was a man.</p><p>And the  people of Yarrow didn't truly understand what it must have taken to  change the meaning of that word. And so they shouldered their weapons;  hunting rifles, some handguns, and even a few ancient assault rifles  passed down from their forebears. They donned cobbled-together suits of  armor made from stiffened leather or half-rotted Kevlar, and as one  they marched out to defend their home.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>At the outskirts of town, a lone scout lay in the woods near the top  of the hill, and watched the column of invaders approach through his  precious pair of ancient binoculars. There weren't many of them,  really. Certainly, they didn't match the numbers of the villagers. And  they didn't have the intimate knowledge of the terrain that the Yarrow  villagers had, and they weren't fighting in defense of their families...</p><p>He  sighed in disgust. Useless advantages, those. He peered through the  binoculars again; looked closers at them. In contrast to the makeshift  equipment worn by the defenders, these soldiers appeared almost  insectile inside their suits of tactical armor. It was sleek, matte  black, and almost painfully high-tech. Their faces were obscured behind  the sensor visors of their helmets, and the scout knew for a fact that  the spear-like weapons they carried could fire a lance of heat capable  of melting rock. He'd seen it happen before, years ago, on a journey to  Angel City, far to the south. It was the last time he'd ever gone there.</p><p>They  rode on hoverdisks. There were five disks for the troops, each of them  carrying ten soldiers, an absurd number. Only the wealthiest of  merchants could afford more than one disk, though they were certainly  worth the cost. He cursed under his breath as he saw the telltale  distortion in the air that signaled the presence of air shields. He  dropped his own large-caliber hunting rifle in disgust. It would be  useless until the shields were dropped. By then it would be too late.  All this was more confirmation that he had been right when he forbid  his daughter his daughter to hide with the other children. Instead, she  lay behind him, sheltered by the swell of the hill, well out of the  conflict that was to come, occasionally kicking stones out of boredom.  Even events such as these could only occupy the nine-year old mind for  so long. So unlike her brother, who had demanded to take part in the  village's defense, despite his father's objections, and, because he was  of age, had gotten his way. Now all the scout could do was pray for his  safety.</p><p>He turned momentarily to gaze at the Tower. The stone  monstrosity covered half the village in its shadow in the evening. The  home of the resident god, Shiil, it was without a doubt the target of  the invaders. He'd heard of War before; it was said that the man  traveled across the world seeking out the remnants of the gods, and  executing them. His motivations for doing so remained unclear, but he  was said to be unmerciful with those humans he found sheltering a god.</p><p>Looking  back at the column, he now focused on the sixth, smaller hoverdisk at  the front of the column. They were closer now, and when viewed through  the binoculars, the features of the man standing upon it were thrown  into sharp relief.</p><p>He was tall, although not markedly so. About  six foot, and obviously fit, although his form was concealed beneath a  black robe. His hair was long; worn all the way down to his waist, and  as black as his robe or the armor of his soldiers. His eyes were  concealed behind a pair of round sunglasses, and his face was set in an  expression of moderate boredom.</p><p>The rumors about those glasses:  that they were sensors of incredible sensitivity, and allowed the  wearer to see with perfect acuity out to the horizon. Some even said  that with them, he could see through solid objects, or even into the  souls of his enemies. There were nearly as many stories about his  apparent youth; for all that he appeared to be a man no older than his  mid-twenties not even the longest lived of the elders could remember a  time when his name was not spoken. Some said that he consumed the souls  of the gods he slew in order to maintain this immortality. Others said  the souls he devoured were more mortal in nature.</p><p>The scout discounted none of these rumors. After all, when dealing with War, it seemed best to be cautious.</p><p>As  the column moved forward, one of the soldiers, with a marking of rank  upon his shoulder, diffidently moved behind the left shoulder of the  man who stood, arms clasped behind his back, at the head of their  number. His voice was quiet, and uncertain as he spoke. "Lord War...  The sensors indicate that we are being observed. It is most likely only  a single scout; the main body of the villagers is still marching toward  our head. Shall..."</p><p>War answered, in a voice just as soft, but  considerably calmer than his underling. "I have been aware of him for  some time. He poses no danger to us, no more than the villagers do. He  is carrying an old H&amp;K SLB2000, chambered for .308. It will not be  able to penetrate your armor, much less the air shields."</p><p>Beneath  his helmet, the young officer paled at the tone of rebuke in his  masters voice. In his time with War, he had never seen the man punish  anyone for something so trivial, but when punishment was handed out, it  was not to be forgotten quickly.</p><p>War gave a small, rare smile.  "Your vigilance does you credit. I will remember this when it comes  time for payment. Now, return to your station; the villagers are  approaching. I think that we will begin with the usual methods."</p><p>Nodding in relief, the officer did so.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>The villagers were beginning to have second thoughts. True, this was  their land that they were defending, and the homes passed down by their  forebears from the time when you could still see the city of S'Tol  across the Lake. And Lord Shiil had always told them that they must  defend themselves against all invaders. But still...</p><p>This was no  bandit, or petty Feudal Lord come to claim their belongings. They could  have dealt with that as they had so many times in the past. Lord Shiil  could have swept aside that kind without even trying. No, this was War:  a figure that had ingrained itself into the souls of every man woman  and child in the world.</p><p>And Lord Shiil was conspicuously absent from the battlefield.</p><p>They  watched nervously as the column approached. More than one among them  felt a trembling in their knees, and was only prevented from running by  the thought of the shame that would be inflicted upon them. Almost as  one, they raised their weapons, and took aim. Closer... closer...</p><p>Finally,  the patience of the crowd snapped. One among them, brash young man of  seventeen summers screamed a yell of defiance. "Fire!" he bellowed, as  his finger, along with a hundred others, pulled on the trigger of his  weapon.</p><p>There was only silence. Not a single one of the weapons  had functioned. With growing panic, the villagers tried again and  again, with the same results. The guns, carefully maintained and  serviced for generations, would not fire.</p><p>War stepped down from  his disk, the air shield lowering as he did so. His mouth was twisted  into a bored smile. "People of the village of Yarrow. You know who I  am. Now step aside; my business is not with you."</p><p>With that, he  stepped into their midst, noting with some disdain the fearful  reactions of the crowd as they attempted to back away from him. All but  the youth, who gave a strangled cry, unsheathed a hunting knife, a  nine-inch length of simple steel, and rushed towards him.</p><p><i>Ah. So it is to be one of these...</i>thought War.</p><p>None  of the soldiers made a move. They understood what their roles were in  this situation. They simply observed, as War allowed the boy within  twenty feet, fifteen, ten... And then, with a contemptuous flick of his  wrist, four chains, tipped with sharp blades sprang from the voluminous  sleeve of his robe. They moved with impossible precision as they wound  themselves about the boy's arms and legs, bearing him to the ground.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>The scout cursed as he watched his only son attempted to rush the  black-robed figure. Stupid boy, what did he hope to accomplish by this?  Then, he heard the rustle of brush the signified his daughters' exit,  and belatedly realized that she must have seen it as well. He rose to  follow her.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>War sighed as the youth struggled. "This boy disobeyed me. His  punishment will remind the rest of you not to do the same." He gave  another flick of his wrist, and flickering bolts of lightning danced  their way down the chains. The boy began to scream, and he writhed in  pain, arching his back so far that it was a wonder that he didn't break  his own back. Some of the villagers groaned as this boy they all knew,  who had worked the fields alongside them, who had caught fish in their  lake, who always been known a friendly, if somewhat foolish person,  seemed to scream his very soul away in their midst.</p><p>Just as it  seemed that the pain of one they knew would break the spell of fear War  had cast over them, the soldiers moved. With practiced ease, they  forced themselves between the villagers and their leader, herding them  at the point of their spears into a large, rough circle.</p><p>Finally,  the screams subsided. The soul-wracking cries of pain faded to subdued  whimpering, and his maddened writhing ceased, aside from the occasional  spasmodic twitch as nerves randomly fired throughout his body. The  chains, apparently of their own volition, unwound themselves from his  body, and retreated back into the recesses of the black robe. War  looked about himself calmly, staring into the eyes of the villagers,  who were half-mad with fright. "He will live, although he will likely  have trouble walking very far on his own from now on. He'll have  shaking limbs and weak muscles like an old man. Hopefully, he has  family that will be willing to care for him. Now..." His gaze moved  toward the tower of Shiil. "Men, keep the villagers here. I don't want  anyone sneaking up behind me." With that, he began walking, taking no  notice of the cries of a little girl as she rushed up to cradle the  fallen form of her elder brother.</p><p>A soldier, young and unranked,  nudged one of his rather more experienced fellows. "Hey... Is it all  right to just let him go alone like that? I mean, I know this isn't the  first god that he's killed, but shouldn't we give him some backup?" His  voice betrayed a certain amount of worry over the source of his income.</p><p>The  other responded. "He'll be fine. The power readings on this one are  fairly low. A jumped-up Lieutenant or a Lord that's let his power slide  into the dregs. It's nothing to worry about. Our job is to keep the  rabble in line. Heh. My dad told me some tales about a couple of times  when he <i>did</i> have to fight alongside Lord War. He was there for the Paris Ruins campaign."</p><p>The first soldier whistled softly. "Fate preserve us from something like that..."<hr noshade="" size="1"/>War came to the top of the hill, upon which stood the Tower of  Shiil. It was obviously not of human construction. Except in rare  cases, in the more advanced city-states and at Phoenix Mountain, humans  simply didn't make things like this anymore. It was ugly, brutish and  squat despite it's height, and dreadfully out of place amidst the  pastoral surroundings of Yarrow. And within, War knew, lay one who  refused to admit how out of place he was.</p><p>He strode up to the  massive gates of the tower, and called out. "Shadow Lord Shiil..." It  was perhaps a bit of flattery; Shiil was only marginally powerful  enough to deserve that title. "I give you this one chance to give  yourself up to a swift death at my hands. I promise that it will be  quite painless."</p><p>There was no answer. There never was. War nodded to himself, satisfied that his offer had been heard. He Changed.</p><p>The  armor, which formed over him, was superficially similar to that which  his soldiers wore. It was just as black, and just as high tech in  appearance, but while his soldiers looked vaguely insectile, War looked  like nothing other than himself. It was bladed across the helm,  forearms and fingers. Spikes jutted out at the elbows. Black,  non-metallic plates whispered across each other as he moved. His round  lenses had altered their shape, becoming part of the sinister visor  that hid his face, and his long hair had become a tassel hanging to his  waist from the top of his helm.</p><p>He moved forward, grasped the  iron gate of Shiil's Tower; a massive thing that must have weighed five  or six tons, and, one handed, tore it from its hinges.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>"...And that's the long and short of what happened at Paris Ruins,"  concluded the soldier, happy to have someone to tell the tale to. "Four  Shadow Lords, fifteen Lieutenants, and who knows how many Soldiers.  Took the better part of eight months for Lord War and his men to clean  up, but once he's set, he doesn't give up no matter how long it takes."  The other soldiers nodded.</p><p>The crash of iron at the Tower caused  most of those present their to turn towards it. A cloud of dust was  settling about fifty feet away from it, where the gate had been flung.  "Well..." drawled the soldier. "Looks like he's getting started."</p><p>By the fallen youth, the scout's young, red-haired daughter glared daggers at them both.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>War was assaulted almost immediately upon stepping through the  threshold, just as expected. Shadow Lords used predictable tactics;  overwhelming force at first, attempting to cow the enemy into  submission, followed by guerrilla style hit-and-run if this failed to  eliminate the enemy. He's seen it hundreds of times before.</p><p>A  cascade of energy beams lanced through the air towards him, ionizing  the air with their passing. Some struck the stone around him, causing  it to melt and run like butter left outside on a hot day. Most struck  his armor, and simply glanced off. War didn't bother dodging. With  energy levels this low, it wasn't worth the effort. He continued  walking, his visor examining the area in detail, attempting to find his  quarry.</p><p><i>Ah... There you are</i>. With no warning, War shot  forward with blinding speed, his fingerblades open, swiping at the  figure he had just glimpsed through his sensors. Expecting it to be  over that quickly, he was startled to find his attack passing through  the already fading image of his opponent. <i>Hmmm. So, an Illusionist as well. And fairly skilled, if he can fool my sensors.</i> His mind tightened with remembered pain. <i>But if he thinks to defeat me with illusion... </i>He  rushed toward the stairs, following the faint sounds he heard ascending  them. His footsteps were heavy with tightly controlled, bitter anger.</p><p>As  soon as he reached the second floor, he sighed. Seven identical images  awaited him. All of them appeared as classical demons, huge, clawed and  bat-winged. They laughed as he skidded to a halt. <i>Oh, for pity's sake...Skilled, but not intelligent.</i></p><p>"So," thundered the Shiils, "You seek to face me in my lair, do you? I shall teach you the price..."</p><p>He  never got farther. War's sensors had already located the eighth, far  smaller figure hiding invisibly near the upper corner of the room, to  the left of the door where he had entered. With a sigh, he materialized  a few chains, which wrapped around his prey and dragged him close.  Shiil yelped as the bladed metal bit into his flesh, and bereft of his  concentration, the images disappeared. War stepped over to look at him.  Shiil appeared to be nothing more frightening in appearance than a  wizened old man with greenish skin and pointed teeth. He writhed  pathetically attempting to escape. Finally, as War stepped near, Shiil  unleashed a massive bolt of energy from his mouth.</p><p>The explosion  ripped throughout the tower, nearly shaking it down. A chunk of the  wall twice the height of a man was ripped away, falling to the ground  outside of the tower. Shiil cackled with glee as the chains loosened.  "Ha! That should teach you to confront Shiil in his... urk!" His  laughter was abruptly caught off as bladed fingers wrapped around his  neck. As the smoke from the blast cleared away, he could clearly see  War standing before him, armor undamaged by the colossal energies of  the blast. His eyes widened, and he collapsed into a terrified heap.  "Why... why are you doing this? I can feel your power! You're a Shadow  Lord, just as I am! Why are you so bent on destroying one of your own  kind?" His entreaties were becoming more desperate, and finding it  difficult to make it past the constricting force applied to his throat.  "I wasn't causing any harm, I wasn't! I was just trying to survive out  here, away from everyone but this little village. I even protected it!  What did I do to deserve this?"</p><p>War was silent for a moment. This  was the first time any of his prey had asked him 'why?' "It doesn't  matter what you did. This is about what you are, and what your kind  took from me. I am not a Shadow Lord, though my power comes from the  same source. I cannot rest until the last of your damned kind is wiped  from the Earth. Only then will I forget what you did to her..." His  voice became soft, near the end, and his head tilted upward, as if he  were peering into the distance.</p><p>Shiil whimpered in sudden  realization. "You... you are him! You are Mou..." His exclamation was  brutally cut off as War's grip tightened, and his gaze once more  focused upon him.</p><p>War spoke, slowly and deliberately. "That name  died, along with man who bore it, a very long time ago. Now there is  only War." His grip closed, and one more dark soul fled screaming into  the abyss.</p><p>Then, he Changed back, wiped his bloody hand on the clothes of his enemy, and walked back to the village of Yarrow.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>By the time he reached the village, the sun was already beginning to  dip below the horizon. He nodded toward his men, who immediately broke  ranks and began to board their disks once again. As he walked toward  his own disk, he heard the voice of a young girl brokenly demand of him  "Why?"</p><p>He turned toward her, more out of curiosity than anything  else. This was, after all, the second time this day that he'd been  asked this question, though he really had no intention of answering.  The girl's father, a man in hunter's gear, was already attempting to  silence her. He prepared to turn away, when out of the corner of his  eye, the rays of the setting sun caught her hair, turning it from red  to an almost violet hue. War froze, staring silently at the girl. His  soldiers looked at each other in confusion.</p><p>Emboldened by the  lack of immediate reprisal, the girl demanded again, "Why did you come  here? Why did you have to hurt my brother? What did we ever do to you?"  Her tears were flowing freely now, but she refused to look away from  him.</p><p>The set of her jaw... the anger in her eyes... A thousand  memories long hidden away came flooding back in an instant. He stepped  towards her, and was faintly pleased that she did not step back. A mere  pace from her, he stopped, and looked down at her solemnly. A moment  passed, and then he spoke.</p><p>"Do you really wish to hear the tale?"</p><p>A  murmur ran through his soldiers. Never, in any of their careers had  Lord War ever offered to share the story of his past with them. None of  them had ever dared ask more than once.</p><p>The girl nodded fiercely, her eyes filled with hate. "Yes! I want to know why you came here."</p><p>War  nodded in return. "Then I'll tell you my story. You may be disappointed  in it; after all, I do not possess a starring role. My part, as ever,  is that of a secondary character, playing a supporting role to two  who's lives shook heaven, hell, and earth." He paused for a moment, as  if to gather his thoughts, and then continued. "It begins, after a  fashion, more than two hundred years ago, back in the days when the  entire face of the earth was covered in great nations, and men thought  that the gods were either made up, or dead, or absent. As for the  place... my life does not begin there, but the story, yes. The story  begins there. In Nerima."</p><p>And again he paused, and stared off  into the distant past. To a time and place when he wore a robe of  white, and spectacles of thick glass, and lived, and fought, and loved  a beautiful woman with all his heart.</p><p>Ganaroth Les Presents</p><p>A Ranma ½ Fanfiction</p><p>Souls and Shadows.</p>
