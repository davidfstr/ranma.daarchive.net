</div><p>Souls and Shadows</p><p>Part 1: A Door Once Opened</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The  sun rose over Nerima, bright and rather hotter than was generally  considered comfortable. All across the city, people who had lain  dormant through the night were beginning to stir to life, and went  about their morning routines. The Tendo house was no exception to this,  although their concept of 'morning routine' was a far cry from the  experience of most.</p><p>Despite Ranma's early warning to Genma that  he wasn't in the mood for one of their morning spars, Genma had  attacked him almost as soon as he had come downstairs. Consequently,  Ranma's backpack was lying unattended in the corner, while Genma was  lying unconscious at the bottom of the koi Pond. Ranma was still in a  bit of a foul mood after the events of the previous day, and the act of  taking it out on his father had utterly failed to impinge on his  conscience.</p><p>He walked back into the dining room, dusting off his  hands. He paused to pick up his backpack, and then sat down at the  table, where Kasumi had laid out an excellent breakfast. His mother and  Happosai were absent, but everyone else was there already. None of them  seemed to notice when he sat down. Shrugging, he reached for the  nearest pickle and speared it with his chopstick. He was about to  transfer it to his mouth when the television news program in which the  others were engrossed caught his attention as well.</p><p>-"...No  suspects have yet been named in connection with the sudden rash of  unexplained deaths, but according to Police representative Yoro Tekeshi  a number of leads are being investigated..." The scene switched from  the solemn, mustachioed anchor to the outside of police headquarters. A  harried looking gentleman of middle years was fair being mobbed by a  collection of reporters, all of whom appeared eager to get their own  microphone as close to him as possible without shoving it up his nose.  Attempting to clear himself some breathing space, the man spoke. "We  are investigating several possible avenues at this time, and we assure  you that despite these unfortunate incidents, the citizens of this city  are as safe as ever."</p><p>This ambiguous statement incited a frenzy  of question, most of which mingled into insensibility. Finally, one  clear question broke through the bedlam.</p><p>"Sir, what about rumors  that all twelve of the bodies carried no lethal wounds? That this is  the work of some kind of untraceable killer?"</p><p>The police representative glared at the off-screen questioner. "We have no comment at this time."-</p><p>Slowly, Nabiki and Akane turned to look at Ranma. He simply stared back at them. Finally, Akane broke in. "So... Demons?"</p><p>He  shrugged. "Maybe. Who know? In this town, it could be space aliens." He  shoveled in a few mouthfuls of rice. "Nothing we can do about it yet.  If we see somethin' going on, we'll help out, but I don't know how to  track down demons. Do you?"</p><p>"Cologne might," muttered Akane.</p><p>Ranma  glared at her, finished his rice, shouldered his backpack, and walked  out the door. Akane waited a few more moments before uttering a rare  curse and following him.</p><p>Nabiki chuckled. "Aw, they're so cute when they're pissed off."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The Nerima City Morgue was, despite the events that occurred within  the town, not conspicuously busier than any other establishment of its  kind. Most of the citizens had learned with remarkable alacrity exactly  how to avoid the fallout from the numerous super powered brawls that  took place on their streets, relatively few were ever injured by the  slightly more unexpected paranormal activity that was part and parcel  of Nerima life.<p>According to the mute evidence of the twelve  bodies lying alongside one another within its walls, this fact was,  however, obsolete.</p><p>Dr. Ono Tofu and Cologne walked among them,  observing them closely. The city coroner stood outside the room, giving  them plenty of privacy. Technically, this was illegal, and certainly  unethical: Both Law and propriety prohibited leaving two unqualified  individuals alone with the remains. But he was bought and paid for, and  he suffered not even a twinge of conscience at his act. And they  certainly seemed to know more about what was going on than he did.</p><p>Tofu  traced a gloved hand along a pattern of bruises marking the arms and  chest of a young woman, perhaps twenty-five years of age. They weren't  enough to warrant the obvious lack of movement in the corpse. <i>The  way they're arranged... Constriction? No...there's no broken bones, no  strangulation marks, no hemorrhaging. It looks like she was just held  in place, while...</i> He shook his head.</p><p>Cologne looked quizzically at him over the body of a middle-aged businessman. "Any theories?"</p><p>He  nodded.. "According to the report, there's no sign of drugs or  poison... other than alcohol in some of them, and PCP in one... but not  enough for an overdose in any case. And the symptoms are inconsistent  with OD. The wounds are hardly worth mentioning. They would have healed  in a couple of days except..." He trailed off.</p><p>"Except that the  victims are dead, you were going to say?" Cologne tapped her chin with  a gnarled finger. "You don't like this, do you?"</p><p>He shrugged.  "I'm not fond of dead bodies. I try to do my best so that I don't see  any." His attempt at flippancy hung in the air with all the buoyancy of  granite. He sighed. "Really, I'm fine. It's just that this is so  obviously not human work... I didn't expect this sort of thing to  happen so soon."</p><p>"So you're sure it's demonic in nature?"</p><p>"No  explainable cause of death, and yet we still have twelve dead bodies.  Precious few other things it could be. It'll take a deep scan to be  certain, though. Whatever did this didn't leave any surface signs." He  paused. "Should you or should I? You're better at this than I am,  but..."</p><p>Cologne laughed, the sound echoing far too loudly in the  corpse-occupied room. "Flattery from you? How novel." She laid her  withered hand flat against the thigh of the businessman's remains.  "Yes, I'll do it. Hold on a bit..."</p><p>She concentrated, sending out  skeins of precisely directed ki deep into the cells of the body,  searching out the residual echoes of the man's life force. There was  nothing. She frowned, and concentrated deeper, sweeping her search  across him again and again. Finally she pulled back, satisfied. "Well,  that's one answer down." She rubbed her brow. That kind of work could  be exhausting.</p><p>Tofu looked at her, ill-concealed impatience evident upon his face. "Which is?"</p><p>"How  this man died. There was no life force present at all. Not a single  thread. So whatever did this must have devoured it directly." She  sighed. "And that means that it is certainly demonic. That Hinako woman  might be able to do something like this... But from what I hear about  her, I doubt even she would go this far."</p><p>"I assume you have a plan?"</p><p>Cologne  nodded. "Of course. Ranma still hasn't agreed to our patronage, and as  long as he does not, we'll not have Akane either. But once he  understands that something like this is loose in his town, he won't  stay away from us long." She gave a bitter smile. "As awful as it may  seem, we may have to thank that demon."</p><p>Tofu's eyebrows raised in  mild astonishment. "If you say so... Still, I don't think that I'll be  shaking its hand any time soon." He looked down at the dead woman, her  eyes open and staring blankly up toward the ceiling, and shuddered.  "We'd better get back to the restaurant. Ryoga will probably be waking  up soon, and I'd rather we were on hand to explain things to him."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane caught up to her fiancé barely a minute after they left the  table. For once, neither of them was late for school, and Ranma was  walking at a leisurely pace rather than sprinting the entire way. In  deference to nigh-unbreakable habit, he was still walking atop the  fence, however. He glanced down at Akane, and grunted unintelligibly.<p>She rolled her eyes. "Thanks for waiting."</p><p>He  glared at her again, then suddenly hopped down from the fence, landing  next to her. Twice he seemed about to speak, but closed his mouth  before any words came out. Finally, looking up at the sky as if  beseeching heaven for answers, he said, "Maybe we should talk to  Cologne, hmm?"</p><p>She smiled slightly. "I think so. If it makes it  any better, we still don't have to agree to her demands. We can just  ask her if she can tell us anything about the murders, and if she  refuses to help, than she's at fault."</p><p>He nodded slowly.  "Right... I don't mind tracking down this demon, y'know. I mean, if  there is one. I just don't want to get caught into having to..." He  broke off.</p><p>"I know." Akane shook her head. "I wouldn't want to either, I guess."</p><p>"Hey,  don't make it sound like it's just my problem!" Ranma gave a crooked  half grin. "You're in the same boat as me, according to her."</p><p>She  quickly turned away, hiding a rising blush. She couldn't really explain  why it was that the thought of sharing something, even something as  terrible as this obviously was with Ranma made her so inexplicably  happy. <i>Maybe because I can really begin to understand how his life works...</i></p><p>Ranma turned away, and for a split second Akane caught a glimpse of him in profile, pensive and solemn. <i>God, he's beautiful,</i>  she thought, and then mentally slapped herself. Still, it was a  pleasant thought, and would possibly have continued if she hadn't  suddenly seen what he was looking at.</p><p>Ukyo Kuonji was crossing  over onto their street on her own way to school. Dressed in her normal  boy's attire, with bandolier and battle-spatula strapped to her back,  Ukyo looked only vaguely feminine, more like an uncommonly beautiful  boy than anything else. Akane had seen her out of that costume enough,  however, to feel a surge of jealousy shoot up her spine. It didn't  appear that she had seen the other two yet, but Ranma was already  walking towards her, apparently intent on speaking to her.</p><p>Akane  ground her teeth together. She knew that Ukyo was Ranma's best friend,  and knew that she shouldn't be jealous, knew... well, at least was  pretty sure that Ranma loved her, not Ukyo. But that didn't stop her  aura from spiking into jagged, flamelike edges.</p><p>"Hey, Ucchan," said Ranma, falling into step beside her.</p><p>Ukyo  looked over at him, and responded in a tired voice. "Hey Ranchan.  How're things?" Her eyes were slightly red, as though she hadn't had  enough sleep, and her face had that peculiar slackness that came from  despair. She'd worn that expression quite a lot lately, although the  tiredness was new.</p><p>Ranma glanced at her critically. "You don't look so good, Ucchan. Couldn't sleep last night?"</p><p>She  shook her head. "I probably could have if I tried. It's just that I was  up all night, packing. Gotta get everything together for the move..."  she yawned. "I just wish I had a little more notice."</p><p>He stopped  walking, frozen in astonishment. Ukyo continued onward for several  paces before noticing his absence, then turned back toward him. By this  time, Akane had caught up, and at the sight of her Ukyo's face  tightened up into a credible imitation of a smile.</p><p>"Akane! How are you? Been treating Ranma right?" Her laugh was singularly unconvincing.</p><p>Akane  grimaced. Confrontations with Ukyo had become... difficult, since the  failed wedding. Privately, Akane believed that Ukyo hadn't quite  forgiven the rest of them for completely excluding her from the great  'adventure' at Mt. Phoenix, and certainly had not forgiven Akane for  'trapping' Ranma into that fiasco of a wedding. She hastily shoved  aside the insistent whispering of her conscience, which said that he <i>had</i> been trapped; knocked out and forcibly dressed in his tuxedo no less.</p><p>"Not  too bad. Turns out that we have to save the world, but what's new?"  Akane's voice was carefully neutral. Ukyo nodded, her smile fading.</p><p>Ranma,  finally catching up mentally with Ukyo's last words to him, began,  "Wait just a minute... The old hag, she talked to you last night, did  she?" Ukyo nodded again. "And just like that, you're going to do what  she says? Just abandon your business, and move in with Shampoo and  Mousse?" Ukyo nodded a third time. Ranma threw his hands up in  frustration. "Why? Jeeze, and here I go, thinking that you're the sane  one outta this bunch..." He yelped as Akane kicked him in the ankle.</p><p>"Idiot," she murmured.</p><p>"Yeah...  anyway," he said, glancing warily at his more confrontational fiancée,  "That just don't make much sense. I mean, you don't owe her anything.  Hell, if you believe that whole demon story of hers, she's the one who  owes you." He nodded, satisfied by his infallible logic.</p><p>She  looked at him sadly. "She threatened to buy out my property if I didn't  do what she said. And she said she'd prevent me from ever getting a  permit anywhere else. I think she was telling the truth." She looked  away, and began walking again. Ranma and Akane both scurried to catch  up to her. "Besides, like Akane said, we get to save the world. I can't  say that's not appealing." Her face brightened, the first genuine sign  of happiness Ranma had seen from her in a while. "And I'll be living  with you too. We'll be able to spend a lot more time together, even if  it is spent training."</p><p>Ranma grimaced, and scratched the back of his head nervously. "Uh... about that... I'm not gonna be moving in with her."</p><p>She shot a hard look at him. "Are you being a jackass again?"</p><p>He  waved his hand in front of him in vigorous denial. "No, no! I'm just...  Well, look. Did she tell you what happened to me yesterday?"</p><p>"No..." Ukyo's expression became suspicious. "Why?"</p><p>Ranma began telling her.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was very dark, and all around him cold winds howled their fury.  Nothing could be heard, except the wind. Nothing could be felt, except  the wind. But despite the darkness, images whirled past him, shining  with a kind of abstract light.<p>A figure, cloaked in insubstantial black armor, surrounded by a blue-black aura of shadows and menace...</p>Ever since you have come into my life, Ryoga, I have tolerated you...<p>Not words, but the memory of what had been said. And then the memory of fear, and of confusion.</p><p><i>Don't interrupt me, Ryoga.</i></p><p>And  then the memory of pain, searing through his arm until all the rest of  the images flashing past faded to shades of gray. Nothing could  penetrate the sheer blinding wall of the agony.</p><p><i>Goodbye, Ryoga.</i></p><p>His  mind desperately cast about, searching every which way for the  salvation that he dimly remembered, even in this state. This time, no  brick was thrown. This time, the hand of that being, sharp edged like a  steel blade, descended toward him.</p><p>With a start, Ryoga awakened,  and for a few moments lay silently on his bed, wondering what had  happened to him, and where he was.</p><p><i>I remember...Fighting Ranma. And then... Akane! She got hurt somehow...</i>Anger began to intrude upon his thoughts. <i>She shouldn't have been there... Dammit, Ranma, you always end up hurting her somehow...</i></p><p>Then he paled as what happened next came back to him. <i>Holy hell...did that really happen the way I remember it?</i>  He looked over toward his right, and saw that his arm had been bound in  a thick plaster cast. Now that he beheld it, he could feel the  unaccountable numbness that came from torment fought off by painkillers.</p><p>There  was an IV connected to his left arm. Contrary to every hospital wake-up  scene in every movie he'd ever observed, he did not immediately attempt  to rip it out. Instead he sat there for a few thoughtful moments.</p><p><i>Well, I guess that means it was real.</i>  He looked around the room. It didn't seem much like a hospital room,  really. It was larger than most hospital rooms; more like a good-sized  bedroom. The hospital bed and what medical equipment there was looked  out of place, as though moved into a room not really designed for that  purpose. The walls were varnished wood, and rust red curtains covered  the single large window.</p><p>He stood up, being careful not to rest  his weight on his injured arm, and walked somewhat unsteadily over to  the IV. The bag was unlabeled; no clues there. Taking the IV stand with  him, he instead went to the window. Once the curtains were thrown back,  his suspicions were confirmed: He had no idea whatsoever about where he  was.</p><p>Glumly, he sat back down on the bed. Being uncertain about  his location was nothing new for him, but he'd never before been in  such sorry condition while lost. He'd have a hard time defending  himself with his arm broken, and the memory of exactly how much it had  hurt made him question the wisdom of leaving this place without his own  supply of painkillers. <i>Do broken bones hurt very much after they've been set? I've never broken one before...</i></p><p>He'd  been run over by vehicles of various sizes, hit by boulders weighing in  excess of thirty tons, hit by people capable of splitting said boulders  in half, whirled about by tornado force winds, and fallen off of more  cliffs than he could remember. None of those experiences had ever ended  up with him breaking anything. That the thing that looked like Ranma  had been able to do this with a simple twist of his hand... Ryoga  shuddered. He wasn't eager for a rematch with that thing, no matter how  humiliating his defeat had been.</p><p>There was a knock on the door,  and a muffled "Are you awake?" The voice was Tofu's. Inside Ryoga's  head, questions began to laboriously form. Tofu was taking care of him,  but this didn't seem like his clinic...</p><p>He shook his head. It'd be easier to just ask the man. "Yeah, I'm up. Sorta, anyway."</p><p>Tofu  opened the door, and walked inside. He was carrying a large bowl,  covered in an embroidered cloth. He set it on a bed tray with pair of  chopsticks, and wheeled it over to Ryoga's bed, so that it could be  comfortably eaten. Ryoga lifted off the cloth, and found that the bowl  contained beef ramen.</p><p>Tofu pulled up a chair, reversed it, and  sat down facing his patient. "So, how are you feeling? I think we did a  fair job on your arm, especially considering that I wasn't allowed to  bring you to a proper hospital." His smile tightened a bit at the  mention of that, but his expression remained generally open and  friendly.</p><p>"All right, I guess..." Ryoga began, than stopped.  Something about what had just been said... "What do you mean by not  being allowed to take me to a hospital?"</p><p>Tofu coughed. "Well, I'm  not exactly an independent practitioner. I've got rules that I have to  follow, and people I have to obey. My... well, my boss I suppose you'd  call her. My boss informed me in no uncertain terms that there would be  too many questions about how you got that..." he gestured at Ryoga's  cast. "...if you went to a general hospital. So we had to treat you at  the clinic."</p><p>Ryoga nodded, warily. This was starting to sound  bad, as though he'd fallen in with organized crime or some such. The  only incongruity was that it was <i>Tofu.</i> He tried imagining the  man in a bad suit, wearing sunglasses and holding a pistol, and utterly  failed. It was like trying to imagine Kasumi as an evil arch villain.  Some things just didn't click.</p><p>Tofu smiled, and there was nothing  false about it. "I'm sure you have a lot of questions. I'll try to  answer them for you." He paused for a moment, thoughtful. "You're at  the Nekohanten, by the way."</p><p>Ryoga almost spat out his mouthful  of ramen. He looked at Tofu in horror, as though the man had mentioned  that he'd been eating Arsenic Surprise. It was worse than organized  crime. He'd been captured by the <i>Amazons.</i> "Holy hell...I'm laid  up in bed in the same house as Cologne, Mousse and Shampoo," he  murmured. "I'll be lucky to get out of here with all of my brain cells  intact."</p><p>Tofu laughed, seeming genuinely delighted by Ryoga's  commentary. "Yes... They do seem to have certain fondness for  pharmaceuticals, don't they? You don't need to worry though. I know for  a fact that Cologne's given strict orders to both of the other that  they aren't to use any mind-altering substances on you."</p><p>Ryoga  relaxed, somewhat. Cologne could usually be trusted, as long as you  kept an eye on her. "Oh, thank god..." He'd seen what Shampoo had done  to Ranma too often to be comfortable around her. And if ever confirmed  the rumors he'd heard; that Mousse had once tied Akane up under a tank  of Yahzunichuan water, this city would be minus one myopic weapon  master. But if Cologne had given them orders, he could trust them to  leave him alone. Mostly.</p><p>"Okay. So I'm at the Nekohanten, and I'm  mostly safe. Good to start with. But..." he shook his head, trying to  clear it. "My memory is a little fuzzy, I think. I remember fighting  with Ranma, and then something happened. And Ranma became..." He  grimaced. "Look, this is a little hard to explain. You know auras  right?" He barely waited for Tofu's answering nod before continuing.  "Well, Ranma's aura changed. A lot. It went all huge and black streaked  and..." He gave up, acknowledging the futility of attempting to  describe an aura in terms of visual effects. "Well, you know what I  mean. Like he became someone else."</p><p>Tofu nodded. "Someone else in the same body, you mean?"</p><p>"Yeah..."  Ryoga frowned. "But not exactly. I mean, it talked to me, and believe  me it didn't sound a thing like Ranma. Too formal, too educated. No  swearing. But the weird thing... The weird thing was that it also  sounded like that thing believed that it <i>was</i> Ranma." He shook his head. "Possession I could get. This was something else."</p><p>The  doctor grinned sadly. "Yes, it was. More amalgamation than possession,  I'm afraid. Ranma finally let loose what's been sleeping inside him for  most of his life."</p><p>Ryoga stared at him, speechless for a time. "I  get the feeling I'm not going to like this, but you'd better tell me  what you know anyway."</p><p>So Tofu told him. Ryoga was right; he didn't like it at all.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>In the halls of Furinkan High School, three students had been  assigned bucket duty as punishment for being tardy. Akane couldn't  quite get it into her head how they had managed to be late, even with  the early start they had gotten that morning, but suspected that long  periods of standing on the sidewalk shouting at each other might have  had something to do with it.<p>Ukyo had listened quite attentively  while Ranma had explained, at some length, exactly why he didn't want  to submit himself to Cologne's plan. About how he was perfectly fine  with hunting demons and saving the world, but not if it meant he had to  become that <i>thing</i> again.</p><p>"The worst part about it is that  I'm still making the decisions," he had said. "It's just that they  aren't the decisions I'd make, not if I wasn't messed up that way."</p><p>That had made some amount of sense, Akane had to admit. Ukyo hadn't seen it the same way, though.</p><p>"Look,  Ranchan. I'm sorry about what you're going through, and I agree that it  can't be easy for you to give in to her like that. But she's already  said that you can't be 'cured.' And if you don't let her help you..."  She'd sighed. "You broke Ryoga's arm, that time. What if next time it's  me?"</p><p>That hadn't helped matters much. Ranma had vehemently denied  that he'd ever do anything to hurt her, and Ukyo had instantly turned  that back on him, pressing him about their engagement. And of course,  Ranma had dithered, never quite denying her. Her hands had clenched so  hard that her nails had dug into her palms, and her jaw ached from the  effort of keeping silent. She'd wanted to <i>hurt</i> him.</p><p>But  she remembered what Cologne had said, last night, about how these  demon-essences that were bound to their souls had affected their  personalities. The only thing that stopped her from committing grievous  bodily harm upon her fiancé was the notion that it might not really be  her that wanted it done.</p><p>So she had kept silent, and allowed Ukyo  to pester Ranma until all three of them had heard the school bell ring.  After that, it had been a race to see who could get to the school  first. Ranma had won, of course, but she'd been neck and neck with Ukyo  the whole way. She smiled at the thought. It wasn't often that she got  to compete with the superhuman group and not get thoroughly humiliated.</p><p>For  now, the three of them stood silently in the hall, carefully not  looking at each other. Akane was fairly certain that the others were  likewise beginning to realize how stupid their fight had been. Neither  of them showed any sign of discomfort from the weight of the buckets,  but if she knew Ranma at least, the boredom would be killing him.</p><p>Even  as she thought this, Ranma shifted, moving closer to the window. From  the third floor window they had a generous view of the back schoolyard,  and the fields, if one chose to look that way. For now, Ranma's eyes  appeared to be fixed on a figure in blue kendo garb that was currently  striding... the word 'walking' wasn't adequate to describe the level of  haughty ceremony put into his steps... striding across the fields  toward the forest.</p><p>"The hell is he doing out there?" asked Ranma, a puzzled expression on his face. "Don't he have class right now?"</p><p>Ukyo  shrugged. "That idiot makes up his own rules. Always has, as far as I  can tell. One more privilege of the asinine samurai class." She smirked.</p><p>Akane  frowned in response. Her own family came from samurai stock, and while  she'd be the first to agree that Kuno was a major piece of evidence for  the theory that there was no intelligent life on Earth, she had a  sneaking suspicion that Ukyo might be deliberately including her in  that statement.</p><p>Ranma grunted. "Hmm. Maybe. I wonder what he's doing, though. Wandering around in the woods usually isn't Blue Moron's thing."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki Kuno, Age 19, walked with stately grace through the wooded  area behind Furinkan high, musing to himself as he did so. His  ever-present bokken was held casually in his right hand, and  occasionally flicked out with lightning speed to remove a stray branch  or spider web from the Blue Thunder's path.<p>He'd ignored the  order of his educator to stand in the hall, reasoning that his time  might better be spent in contemplation unencumbered by the trivial  distractions of the school. The teacher hadn't attempted to obstruct  him. Obviously fearful of his might, the obsequious lecturer had merely  mumbled something under his breath and turned back to address his class.</p><p>No  respect for the requirements of a superior mind, the lot of them. He  sighed, bemoaning the fate that had him attending this place of  infantile learning with the rest of these churls. He learned far more  in his solitary studies: of his country's great history, and of the  part his own family had played in it. Of poetry, and art, and of  warfare. He sighed again, this time more suitably dramatic. Of course,  going to this common school did mean that he was able to observe his  twin loves on a frequent basis...</p><p>As he walked, he began composing a poem in his head, directed toward one of those two spirited beauties.</p><p><i>Pig Tailed Girl, as fair</i></p><p><i>As autumn leaves blown in the</i></p><p><i>Wind of my passing.</i></p><p>He frowned. As beautiful as the lines surely were, there was something amiss with them that he couldn't quite put his finger on.</p><p>So  lost in thoughts of love and poetry was he, that he didn't notice the  black, coiled form in front of him until he had already run into it.  Puzzled, he prodded it sharply with his bokken, and was rewarded when  the the great, snakelike being unwound itself from around the tree, and  stared balefully into Kuno's face with scarlet, unblinking eyes.</p><p>The  thing did indeed resemble a snake, but with several obvious  differences. It possessed no mouth, but rather had a small round  aperture near the front of its head, about the size of a woman's  bracelet. Its black scales shone with a dull finish, and as it reared  up to a height of about ten feet, Kuno could clearly see a series of  segmented, rib like spines crossing over its chest, thin flesh  stretched between them. Slowly, the ribs began to unfold until they  formed a pair of sails running down its sides, and exposed a brilliant  red underbelly. Its tail, ending in a kind of bony club, twitched as  though restive, and the eyes continued to stare down at him.</p><p>Kuno  gaped at the creature for a few moments, stunned, for once, into  speechlessness. Then, a manic glint coming to his eye, he began to  chuckle.</p><p>The Shadow Snake, already preparing to devour the  intruder's life force, paused. It had never gotten a reaction quite  like this before from its prey.</p><p>"Heh heh... Red and black, eh?"  Kuno moved his bokken into a guard position. "So, the demon Saotome  finally shows his true form. Has it truly taken you this long to work  up the courage to face me directly? Truly, I had tired of defeating  your churlish minions."</p><p>It stood there, stock-still and utterly  nonplussed. It was dimly capably of understanding Kuno's language, but  as far as it could tell, the strange man wasn't making any sense.</p><p>"So,  you stand speechless, no doubt too afraid to even plead for mercy! But  this display of cowardice will avail you not, for the Blue Thunder  intends this to be our final confrontation!" Even as he spoke, Kuno  rushed forward, bringing his bokken around in a dizzying arc to impact  on the snout of the Shadow Snake.</p><p>It watched the weapon approach  with a kind of lazy nonchalance, secure in its inability to be hurt by  a bit of wooden stick. The line of pain that flashed through it when  the bokken carved a bloody in its hide came as a devastating shock.</p><p>Whatever  else could be said about Tatewaki Kuno, (and indeed, volumes could have  been written on him, although they would be mostly psychological in  nature) he was an excellent swordsman. Miyamoto Musashi was generally  considered to be the finest in Japan's history, but even he couldn't  cut rocks in half by air pressure alone.</p><p>For Kuno's part, the  events were no less astounding. Accustomed to easily cleaving through  stone with his wooden blade, the fact that only this minor cut had been  opened was nearly unbelievable. Almost faster than the human eye could  follow, he followed up with two more slashes, each opening an equally  insignificant wound in the serpent's armored scales.</p><p>The Shadow  Snake was incapable of hissing like a terrestrial serpent, but managed  to convey its displeasure at the way events were turning out all the  same. The idiot had actually managed to hurt it! Whatever that weapon  was, it needed to be dealt with, and quickly. Managing to dodge a  fourth strike, it brought its tail around in a lethal swing which  impacted Kuno's torso and sent him flying through the woods, back  toward the school.</p><p>Confident that its opponent would be dead from the blow, the serpent followed at its leisure.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ryoga's ramen had long since gone cold as he sat in bed mulling over  what Tofu had said to him. That Ranma carried a demon in him wasn't  terribly surprising. Anyone who had seen him at Jusendo would have  known that <i>something</i> frightening lay within him. The news that  the rest of them were similarly bound was only slightly more shocking.  After all, there wasn't a normal personality in the bunch, even  including, (and here he begged for forgiveness) Akane. But even if it  wasn't an incredible shock, it was still a lot to take in.<p>"So," he began, slowly. "The rest of us are going to have to go through this transformation deal too?"</p><p>Tofu  nodded. "I'm afraid so, Ryoga. According to what I know of the process,  which admittedly isn't a whole lot, eventually you'll be placed in a  position where you have to make a choice: Whether to allow yourself to  lose something that you value dearly, or to give in to that... dark  spot... inside of you." He rubbed the bridge of his nose. "I'm sorry,  this is all pretty theoretical. I'm just relaying the lore that we have  about this process. There's never been any test subject, so I can't  tell you for certain. Ranma seems to bear it out, however. Apparently  while he was at... Jusendo?"</p><p>Ryoga nodded.</p><p>"Right. Well,  apparently, while he was at Jusendo he was faced with the prospect of  loosing Akane, and he instead chose to allow the demon essence to  awaken. Now, from what you've told me, he didn't exhibit the kind of  intense power then that he did with you, so maybe the fact that he  didn't consciously know what he was doing affected it." Tofu tapped his  chin a few times, then got up and began walking about the room in a  contemplative daze. "But conscious or not, he'd made the deal. So when  Akane was again injured during your fight..."</p><p>Ryoga winced. Saying that he was embarrassed about that would have been like saying that he had a small dislike of cold water.</p><p>"...the  demon essence immediately awakened again. I'd guess that since this  time it already had a channel to come through, the power it endowed him  with was far greater." Tofu shook his head. "If I didn't firsthand see  the kind of trauma it caused that poor boy, I'd be tempted to call the  process fascinating. As it is, I just hope he can survive it."</p><p>Ryoga frowned. "Poor boy? Ranma and me aren't that much younger than you."</p><p>The  doctor grimaced. "Ah, well that's not entirely true... I'm a bit older  than I look. I was apprenticed to Cologne some years ago..." he ignored  Ryoga's incredulous look. "...and among the things I was taught were  the anti-aging ki-excercises that she uses to maintain herself." He  smiled. "I don't look to bad for someone who's pushing fifty three."</p><p>The lost boy stared at him. "And you're trying to have a relationship with Kasumi?"</p><p>Tofu's glasses began to fog up, and then quickly cleared again. "K..Kasumi is very mature for her age."</p><p>"Right...Um..."  He floundered around a bit, attempting to form a coherent thought that  didn't follow those suddenly disturbing lines. "So, you can't cure us?"</p><p>"No,  I'm sorry. Even setting the whole issue of saving the world aside, it  would be impossible without turning you into a vegetable." Tofu stopped  short at Ryoga's sudden look of horror, and remembered that he wasn't  dealing with most subtle person in Nerima. "I mean, without destroying  your personality. I couldn't actually turn you into a... Well, the  point is, you were bonded to the demon essence at the age of four  months. If we were to remove it, and every trace of alteration it had  made to your psyche, you'd be left with the approximate personality of  a four-month-old infant."</p><p>The boy sighed heavily. Knowing how to  perform the perfected Shi Shi Hokodan was beginning to become a serious  risk to the structural integrity of this house. "Fine, I understand.  But I don't think I'm going to be killing any demons for a while." He  gestured at his right arm. "The one I fought yesterday did a number on  me."</p><p>Tofu nodded, not mentioning that there was already another  one running around the city. "I'll leave you alone. You really need to  rest; it's the best way to speed your recovery." He paused. "That and  drinking a lot of fluids. I'll have Shampoo bring you up something to  drink." He turned to leave, picking up the cold ramen bowl as he went.  Just as he was about to exit the room, Ryoga's voice stopped him.</p><p>"Dr Tofu? When the dem...when Ranma was about to kill me... Why didn't my own demon wake up?"</p><p>Tofu  grimaced again before turning back to answer. "Well, I can't be  completely sure, you understand. But my impression of you is that  you've never particularly valued your own life." He paused, obviously  torn between propriety and his desire to speak. Desire won out. "Maybe  it's none of my business, but... try to find something to be happy  about, Ryoga. Life's too hard to go through being miserable all the  time." With that, he turned and left.</p><p>Ryoga stared at the door  for some time after the doctor had gone, and then sank back down into  the cushions of the bed. He couldn't help being a bit angry at Tofu for  saying things like that to him; what did he know about Ryoga Hibiki's  problems? But at the same time...</p><p>He reached up to scratch a sudden itch on the back of his head. He hoped he'd get a chance to call Akari soon.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"What the hell..." said Ranma, as Kuno flew out of the woods and  plowed a long furrow in the baseball field. The speed at which the  upperclassman had been traveling was obviously great, but Kuno's  ability to recover from damage was almost legendary, so Ranma was more  confused than concerned. It was only when the huge, snake-like form  emerged into view that Ranma understood what was going on.<p>"Wow," said Ukyo. "Big sucker, ain't it? Must be twenty, twenty-five feet long..."</p><p>"Who cares how big it is?" said Akane. "We can't let it kill Kuno!"</p><p>The  others went silent, and looked guiltily at one another. Eventually,  Ranma scuffed his slipper against the ground and said, despondently.  "Yeah, I guess so. Maybe we could let it rough him up a bit?"</p><p>That earned him a glare from Akane, and he retreated. "I guess not."</p><p>"Um...  While we were talking about it, it looks like the snake made its own  decision," said Ukyo, peering out the window. "It's just knocked  Kuno...Holy Crap!"</p><p>Expletives were not nearly as rare from Ukyo  as they were from Akane, but they still served as adequate warning. All  three of them had time to duck as the window exploded from outside, and  Kuno's battered form struck the ceiling and fell back to ground, limp  as a wet rag.</p><p>Ranma whistled. "That thing's damn strong. Knocked him up three stories, and an' probably... what, two hundred feet?"</p><p>Akane,  who was busy looking Kuno over, hissed at him. "Can you please save the  commentary for later, Ranma? I'm trying to see if Kuno's all right."</p><p>Her  fiancé looked at her, annoyed. "Hey, I'm just trying to get a handle on  its abilities, okay? I'm gonna be the one who ends up fighting this  thing, after all."</p><p>Ukyo and Akane shook their heads simultaneously. "Not alone, you're not," said Ukyo.</p><p>"Indeed," declared Kuno, in a weak voice from the floor. "The demon Saotome has not yet defeated me..."</p><p>Ranma  stared at him, and then shook his head. "I don't wanna know where that  came from. Akane, keep him from doing anything stupid, will you?" He  turned back toward the window, attempting to ignore the clamoring of  students and teachers as they began filtering into the hallway to catch  the latest floorshow.</p><p>The serpent had somehow climbed the wall,  and was already dragging itself through the broken window, its scales  scraping noisily across shattered glass. Eyes like twin embers fixed  Ranma in a predatory stare.</p><p>"...Shit," he said.</p><p>Authors Notes:</p><p>About  Kuno and Nabiki's ages. They're both 19 and both still in high school.  I rationalize this by claiming that both of them have birthdays very  close to the cutoff point for new students, making them among the  oldest students in their age group. Second, I have deliberately set  this story in late spring, which is, I believe, the last part of the  Japanese School year. If I'm wrong about this, please feel free to  correct me, and I will make my own corrections.</p><p>The upshot of  this is that both of them are almost out of their last year of high  school. I've known people like this myself, who were 19 in their last  year, through no fault of their own. So, before anyone asks, neither  Nabiki nor Kuno were held back.</p><p>Kuno would certainly kill you if you implied it. Nabiki would probably just laugh.</p>
