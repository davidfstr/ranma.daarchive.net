</div>Author's note:<p>Congratulations Another Duck! You guessed correctly ^_^ and now have a guest role slotted for an upcoming episode. And thanks for the great review. Drop me a line at  with the name you'd like to have appear (otherwise I will be forced to use your real name, Swedish boy ^_~).<p>And yeah, last chapter wasn't a real Diablo quest but god, I got sick of sending them running after a scroll.<p>Well, this is the big one. Hope it came out okay. I kind of have the next episode completely planned out and since I have to stay home all weekend to take care of my sick kitten, I'll probably get a chance to write it in the coming days.<p>Thanks for all your reviews!<p>======<p>Act 3, Quest 5<p>The Blackened Temple<p>Genma grabbed onto his staff as he surveyed the area. Looking over his shoulder, he wondered where the hell his son had gone. How long did it take to enchant a sword? He knew things were strained between his son and his fiancée but hopefully they hadn't killed each other.<p>Over to his right, Genma heard the sounds of fighting. He heard a barbarian war cry and realized that Ryoga and Ukyo had been found out. He needed to join the fray rather than let the two of them take all the heat. But where the hell was Ranma?<p>The brush next to him began to move and Genma readied a barrage of insults to hurl at his son. But Shinnosuke emerged instead. Genma looked him over and realized that he was holding Ranma's sword.<p>"Where's Ranma?" Genma demanded.<p>Shinnosuke shook his head and tried to find the right motions to explain it. But suddenly, a monster crashed through the brush and Genma realized that Ranma would have to take care of himself.<p>* * *<p>It was Ryoga's fault!<p>Ukyo let the blades from her hand express some of her frustration at their situation. Stupid Ryoga. Only he would walk straight at the monsters instead of heading towards Shampoo and Mousse to warn them about the fire powered monster near them.<p>Ryoga let out another war cry as he brought his axe down and cleaved a monster in two. His axe got stuck in the mess of monster parts and he had to reach down to pull it free. The moment his attention was turned, one of the demons made a charge.<p>"Ryoga!" Ukyo cried as she ran towards him. Before he could react, Ukyo was already in action. Placing one hand on his back, she used him like a vaulting horse and leapt over him, a firm foot outstretched and making contact with the monster's face. She followed up with a couple of slices and watched with satisfaction as the monster fell to the ground dead.<p>"Thanks," Ryoga said as he brought his axe up to his shoulder.<p>"No problem, sugar," she said with a smile. "Wouldn't want you to get wasted or anything. At least, no before I get a chance to pummel you for attracting these creeps to us."<p>"Nice to know you care," Ryoga said, with an unhappy smile.<p>* * *<p>Shampoo heard the sounds of fighting nearby. Stupid pig boy probably just gave them away. Gripping her spear tightly, Shampoo was about to run over to help them when she felt a firm grip on her arm.<p>Looking down, she saw Mousse holding on. "Let go," she hissed.<p>Mousse shook his head. "There's something out there."<p>"How blind boy see that?" she demanded.<p>"I don't need to see it, I can feel it," he said softly. "That's reason enough not to go out. There's something very wrong with whatever is out there."<p>She was about to argue further when she suddenly felt something land on her back. She fell forward right onto Mousse and they tumbled on the ground. Shampoo felt her head hit something one the way down and the world got a bit fuzzy.<p>"Shampoo, are you okay?"<p>Shampoo blinked and things came into focus. All she could see was a rather concern Mousse holding her head. She quickly pushed herself into a sitting position and placed her hand on her head. She felt something warm and when she brought her hand back, she realized it was blood.<p>She heard something giggling and turning, she saw a little Flayer holding a knife. Shampoo's eyes went dark and with a battle cry, she launched herself at the little beast.<p>* * *<p>Shinnosuke held the sword limply. He was a sailor, a damn good one at that. But he was no fighter. The sword was almost useless in his hands and the only reason he was still standing was because Genma was in full werewolf mode and making mincemeat of the monsters.<p>"Let's go!" Genma said, suddenly morphing back and grabbing his arm, pulling him away from the scene.<p>They pushed there was through the foliage until they found Shampoo and Mousse. Shinnosuke felt the hand on him change into a wolf paw. Feeling rather useless, he moved over to Mousse and quickly pulled the boy out of the way.<p>"Thanks, Ryoga," Mousse said.<p>Shinnosuke went to protest but had no voice. So he resorted to hit him on the head. Mousse balked on impact and looked up at him protest. A few seconds later, he realized it was Shinnosuke.<p>"Sorry," Mousse said. "So you're out of the fight too?" Shinnosuke nodded. "How's it going?" Shinnosuke gave a 'thumbs up'.<p>Mousse nodded and then a little light bulb went off in his head. "Wait a minute! I think I've got an idea."<p>Shampoo, meanwhile, was trying to see how many Flayers she could fit onto her spear at one time. She was doing great until a shaman showed up and spat some fire at her. Holding up her spear, she tried to protect herself.  It worked pretty well. Except that her spear was now a Flayer shish kebob.<p>The Shaman prepared another burst of fire when he suddenly exploded as a Bone Spear tore through him. Shampoo found herself completely covered with shaman Flayer parts, holding a bunch of roasted Flayers on her spear.<p>Looking over, she saw Mousse prepping another Bone Spear spell as Shinnosuke turned him to face the right way. The spell leapt off his arm and towards the second shaman. Shinnosuke patted him on the back.<p>"All the Shaman are gone?" Mousse asked. Shinnosuke nodded. Mousse smiled and prepped a Corpse Explosion spell. Shampoo tried to say something but before she could the spell was cast and all the little bodies on her spear exploded.<p>Ukyo and Ryoga rejoined the group at that moment and were a bit surprised to see Shampoo covered from head to toe in Flayer bits. Ryoga grimaced a bit but Ukyo's response was to giggle.<p>Shampoo looked at her and stared for a few moments. Then she started to smile and trotted over to Ukyo.<p>"Good friend Ukyo! Shampoo so happy to see you all right," she said glomping herself on the other girl. Ukyo cried out in protest and tried to get Shampoo off her. Now it was Ryoga's turn to laugh.<p>"What the hell do you think is so funny?" Ukyo demanded, as she finally managed to get Shampoo off her. Looking down, she realized she was completely covered in Flayer goo. Shampoo looked over at her with a smile and tossed her slime covered hair back.<p>Ryoga was still laughing. Ukyo frowned and looked over at Shampoo. She motioned her head towards Ryoga and Shampoo nodded.<p>"RYOGA!" they cried and glomped him.<p>"Some guys get all the luck," Mousse said trying to watch Ryoga struggle against the two girls. Shinnosuke, seeing everything crystal clear, could only nod.<p>* * *<p>Genma stumbled into the small hut first, followed quickly by Shinnosuke and Mousse. Ryoga, Shampoo and Ukyo followed last, looking around nervously for any more monsters.<p>"I think we're clear," Ukyo said.<p>"Good," Genma said. "We need time to regroup."<p>"But it's just a bunch of Flayers!" Ukyo said. "We can take them on easily and then charge the big guys."<p>Genma shook his head. "It's too easy. They're holding back."<p>"Then we draw out," Shampoo said.<p>"And then what?" Mousse asked. "We're two people short. If Genma is right…"<p>"Feh," Ryoga said. "We don't Ranma to fight these things. Let them throw whatever they want at us. We can handle it."<p>"This isn't the time to get proud," Mousse said. "We need a plan on…"<p>"Shampoo sick of plans," she said. "Always plan, always careful. Why no just go out and fight?"<p>"She's right," Ukyo said. "Look at where the last plan got us. Let's just go out as a group and charge them."<p>"Charge them," Ryoga said with a smile. "That a great idea."<p>"Yeah," Genma said. "Great idea. Why don't we just go out and attack them en masse and hope that there's nothing stronger than a Flayer out there. And if there is, well we should be able to take it on. Or we'll just get hacked to bits and let them take over the rest of this area."<p>Genma took in a deep breath. "I know it's been hard these past couple of days with the trip over here and Nabiki's sacrifice. And I know those Flayers are the most annoying creatures on this entire planet. But this is not the time to let your emotions take control over you. We will plan this out because I know that there's something much stronger out there. Ukyo and Shampoo go and scout ahead. The rest of us are going to stay behind and wait for you to get back."<p>* * *<p>"Stupid Genma," Ukyo said as she and Shampoo slowly wove their way back towards the center of town. "Thinks he knows everything. And what about Ran-chan? Doesn't he care about his son?"<p>"Genma care," Shampoo said. "But try no let show. Need to keep group in control."<p>"So you think he's right too?" Ukyo said, somewhat dejected by the thought.<p>"Think he right," Shampoo said. "But no agree out loud."<p>Ukyo smiled. "Yeah, I'd hate to have to tell him he's right. I just hope Ran-chan is alright."<p>"Ranma be fine. Have Akane to protect him."<p>Ukyo giggled. "The girls are really kicking some ass lately."<p>Shampoo smiled. "Is way it should be."<p>Ukyo nodded. She paused for a minute and cleared her throat. "Hey Shampoo… look, I know we didn't get along real well in the beginning but… well, it's be fun this whole trip. I'm glad we could fight together."<p>"Is more than fight together. Shampoo think Ukyo friend."<p>"Yeah, me too," Ukyo said. "So I'll see you later, okay?"<p>Shampoo nodded and watched Ukyo took off. She had to smile. It had been a really long time since Shampoo had considered anyone a friend. And considering the way things in her life had been going recently, she was really going to need one.<p>* * *<p>Meanwhile, back in the hut, Ryoga was pacing back and forth. "I can't take this waiting," he said.<p>"Just a little while longer," Genma said.<p>Mousse said and tried to relax. Shinnosuke sat near him, looking at the blade. Looking over at Mousse, he motioned to the sword.<p>"That? That's just Ranma's. Nothing special about it." But Shinnosuke had seen him fight with it. There had to be something magical about it. "He's just a good fighter."<p>Shinnosuke nodded. Slowly using the sword, he drew Akane's name into to dust and pointed at it.<p>Mousse squinted to get a good look at it. "Akane?" he said. Shinnosuke nodded and pointed to the sword. "Oh Akane and Ranma." Mouse paused and tried to think it out. "It's kind of complicated."<p>"They're engaged," Genma said firmly.<p>"Not that he deserves her," Ryoga said. "He's a real jerk most of the time to her. All they do is fight."<p>Mousse shrugged. "They fight but… it's not really fighting."<p>Ryoga snorted. "Sure it's not. That's why she keep belting him up to the stratosphere on a daily basis."<p>Shinnosuke nodded slowly and let the sword rest on the ground. He stood up and walked towards the door.<p>"Where are you going?" Genma asked, watching him leave. Shinnosuke held up his hands and tried to think of a motion for…<p>"Oh," Genma said, getting the idea. "Just stay close to the hut."<p>Shinnosuke nodded and left the hut. Mousse was right. He had seen Akane and Ranma fighting but it never felt real. He knew that Akane had had her mind on something during their entire boat trip together, and he was beginning to see what it was.<p>He remembered how distraught she had been when Ranma had found them. How hurt she had been when she told him that it appeared he had forgotten her. And the way he was always there to rescue her. How he kept risking his own life for hers.<p>Shinnosuke realized he had probably lost before he could even begin. Looking at hut, he began to walk away. He had one last thing to do for Akane before he could give up on her. But that meant finding her first.<p>* * *<p>"How long does it take to go to the bathroom?" Genma asked, looking at the door.<p>"You want me to go look for him?" Ryoga asked.<p>Genma sighed and shook his head. "You'd get lost the moment you stepped out the door."<p>"I'll go," Mousse said.<p>"You wouldn't be able to see him," Genma said. "I'll go ahead." He stood up and left the two boys behind.<p>Mousse concentrated on a few simple mantras while Ryoga continued to pace. After a few rounds, Ryoga added some mumbling under his breath and finally, tossing his axe from hand to hand. Mousse tried to remain calm but after awhile he couldn't take it anymore.<p>"What's wrong!" he demanded.<p>Ryoga stopped and looked at him. "I'm just… anxious, all right."<p>"Why?"<p>"Well, haven't you noticed that everyone had pretty much gone out on their own? Considering what Genma's been saying might be out there, I don't think it's a good idea to be by yourself."<p>Mousse sighed. "They'll be fine. The girls have been taking care of themselves for years and Genma will find Shinnosuke quickly."<p>"What about Ranma and Akane? Where are they?"<p>Mousse shrugged. "I really don't know but if they're together, they're probably safe."<p>Ryoga frowned. "I just don't like getting left…"<p>Ryoga never finished his sentence. A scream filled the air. Looking over at Mousse, Ryoga shook his head and grabbed the necromancer. "That's it," he said. "We are not staying around here any more."<p>* * *<p>Shinnosuke took silent steps as he treaded along the side of the village's main road. He might not have been a great fighter but he knew how to walk softly. After all, the last thing you wanted to do a ship was wake someone up when it wasn't their watch.<p>He carefully climbed a set of stairs to an open stone courtyard. The place looked like an entranceway but he could see a door. Looking along the back wall, he didn't see any trace of a special keyhole or anything.<p>His foot hit a loose stone and suddenly the floor opened up, uncurling itself until there was a new staircase leading down into the darkness. Cautiously, Shinnosuke peered downward, wondering if maybe this lead to where Akane was.<p>Before he got the chance to go down, he heard a low rumble behind him. Turning he saw two men standing in front of him. He held out a hand to show them that he meant not harm but they merely growled at him.<p>Looking at them closer, he realized that despite their outwardly human appearance, these were not humans anymore. They're eyes shone black and their skin was a deathly pale. They weren't forming any coherent statements and they looked at him like he was dinner.<p>Shinnosuke tried to back up but he was already against the wall. The two monsters advanced, sneering at him.<p>"Look out!"<p>Shinnosuke ducked as the two monsters came flying at him and hit the wall. Ukyo ran forward and grabbed his arm.<p>"Come on, honey, we need to haul ass fast," she said, dragging him out of the temple and back to the main road.<p>The Council members quickly recovered and began their pursuit. Ukyo looked over her shoulder. "This ain't going to work," she said. "We can't outrun them."<p>She stopped and turned to face them. One of them moved with lightning speed towards her while the other lumbered along, weighed down by what was apparently stone skin. Ukyo knew she was no match for them by herself and Shinnosuke wasn't up to a fight.<p>She suddenly pushed him into the brush just as the first Council member flew past her. Looking back, she realized they had her surrounded. This was it, she realized. This was that moment they taught her about in school. This was when she had to find the strength to cast the Assassin's most powerful spell.<p>Ukyo closed her eyes and concentrated, trying to stretch her mind beyond the planet, into another part of the universe where her shadow dwelled. Calling out, she asked for its help, just as she had when Akane was lost in the Shadow realm.<p>Next to her, the air began to waver and suddenly her shadow appeared. Opening her eyes, Ukyo found herself staring in a mirror. The shadow looked back at her with a small smile and nodded.<p>Ukyo turned and headed towards Stoneskin, while her shadow went after Quickfoot.<p>* * *<p>Shampoo was on the other side of town when she heard the battle break out. Knowing that it was Ukyo, she quickly turned and ran towards the sounds. It took her only moments before she arrived at the scene.<p>Ukyo was fighting against something that moved too quickly for her to hit. The girl looked beaten but she wasn't stopping. Occasionally, Shampoo could hear Ukyo make contact but it was a losing battle. She needed help. Shampoo ran towards her, spear raised in her hand. She threw it, watching as it arched in the air and towards its target.<p>But it was too late. The monster struck downward and with a sickening crunch, cracked Ukyo's skull open. The assassin dropped to the ground, her eyes staring emptily towards Shampoo.<p>The spear hit the monster in the arm and it howled in rage. But its screaming was nothing compared to the sound Shampoo was making. Rage and sorrow mixed in the Amazon's cry as she ran towards the beast at full speed.<p>She ducked as its claw tried to catch her and she grabbed her spear from out of its side. She turned and quickly struck it again, aiming for just behind its neck and pulling the spear out quickly. The Council member turned towards her and Shampoo didn't even bother to give it a chance to attack again, she slammed her spear right into its eye, killing it instantly.<p>She let the spear fall with the body and ran over to where Ukyo lay. Kneeling down, she careful placed a hand on Ukyo's cheek, feeling the coldness of death already there. Shampoo started to cry, her shoulder shaking as the sobs started to come out.<p>Something approached her and looking up, she saw another monster, this one with skin that looked like stone. Wiping her tears away, Shampoo stood up and grabbed her spear from the corpse. It was time for payback.<p>* * *<p>Genma stumbled through the forest, no longer caring if he made any noise. The anguished cry he had just heard could only mean that there was trouble ahead. And speed overrode his desire for stealth.<p>In his race to get there, he tripped over something that was sprawled on the ground. Looking back he recognized Ukyo. Crawling over, he took the girl's head carefully in his hands.<p>Ukyo groaned and opened her eyes. "Ow," she said softly.<p>"Are you all right?" he asked.<p>Ukyo nodded slowly, feeling a bit dizzy. "Yeah… the damn thing threw me clear across the forest. I think I hit my head on a tree."<p>Genma felt the back of her head and nodded. "I think it's just a bruise. You should be okay. Here," he said handing her a potion, "take it."<p>Ukyo sighed, not really wanting to take anything from Genma but knowing she needed it. She drank the potion just as Mousse and Ryoga crashed onto the scene.<p>"What happened?" Ryoga said, looking at her.<p>"Monsters," she said, "really mean ones too. I had to call my shadow just to get some leverage on them. Crap, where's Shinnosuke?"<p>"You saw him?" Genma asked.<p>"Yeah, he was with me but I pushed him out of the fight. Oh man, he must still be back there," she said standing up. "We have to go help him. I don't know how long my shadow can hold out against him."<p>"I think we heard it scream," Mousse said.<p>"Not possible," Ukyo said. "It can't talk."<p>"Well, it must have been you then," Ryoga said.<p>"I don't think so… I mean, it was pretty much a direct hit on me and I was out before I knew what hit me."<p>"It was a girl's scream," Ryoga said.<p>Mousse suddenly paled. "Shampoo…"<p>* * *<p>Shampoo hit the monster again. Her spear was having no effect against its natural armor. She tried one more lunge and watched, horrified, as her spear snapped in two. She looked down at the broken part in her hand with fear.<p>The monster growled and swung at her, making contact and sending her to the ground. Shampoo grimaced as she felt her head swim again from the impact. She quickly recovered, tumbling forward twice and standing up, still grasping the broken spear.<p>The monster came at her again, but Shampoo avoided him this time, sliding under his arm and towards the place where the other half of her spear was. Grabbing it, she turned quickly, crouching and holding her two hands out to her sides.<p>The Council member moved towards her but Shampoo waited. It threw a punch at her but she ducked to avoid it. When she stood up, she was face to face with the beast. Quickly, she snapped her arms forward, propelling the two spear pieces through the monster's ears and piercing its brain.<p>It stumbled backwards, howling in pain. Thrashing about, it finally expired, dropping to the ground in a heap. Shampoo didn't relish the victory, she felt like she was about to cry again.<p>"SHAMPOO!"<p>She turned and looked at where the voice was calling her. She saw Genma, Ryoga, Shinnosuke, Mousse and Ukyo running towards her. Ukyo? But Ukyo was…<p>She smiled widely. Ukyo was alive. Somehow, Ukyo was alive. "UKY…"<p>The name caught in her throat. Shampoo's face crumpled as she felt a searing pain in her chest. Looking down, she something coming through her body. Looking back, she saw the third council member, hidden until now, surfacing only when its brethren had been killed. It sneered and pulled its clawed hand back, letting her body fall to the ground.<p>"NO!" Akane screamed as she and Ranma emerged from the underground temple.<p>Ryoga got there first, leaping in the air with a barbarian cry and embedded his axe in the monster. The Council member staggered, taking Ryoga's axe with it. Ukyo was suddenly there, slashing with knifed hands, shredding it as quickly as she could.<p>It stumbled backwards and started to run away. But a Firewall appeared and caught it before it could go any further. The monster screamed in anguished and expired, leaving a smoke corpse on the ground.<p>It was suddenly very silent. The group slowly moved from battle mode to something very different. Something much worse.<p>"Shampoo?" Ukyo said, breaking the silence first and walking toward the fallen amazon. But Ryoga caught her and held her back. "SHAMPOO!" Ukyo cried, struggling against Ryoga's grip. But Ryoga wouldn't let go. He didn't want her to have to see it up close.<p>"Give her a potion," Akane cried. "Give her a potion now!" she turned to Ranma, grabbing his tunic in her hands. "A potion will help. Tell me a potion will help," she pleaded.<p>Ranma's face was pained and Akane collapsed sobbing in his arms. He gingerly wrapped his arms around her, closing his own eyes to prevent the flow of tears. Genma looked at the scene with an anguished expression. Shinnosuke came out of the brush and was suddenly frozen at the sight.<p>Mousse did not have to see her to know what had happened. No one stopped him as he walked over to the Amazon's body. Slowly he turned her around so she was facing upward. Carefully, he let her head fall into his lap and placed a hand over her still face.<p>Genma walked over and placed a hand on his shoulder. "I'm sorry," the older man said.<p>"Not like this," Mousse said, tears already overflowing and running down his cheeks. "It can't end like this." His head dropped forward.<p>"I'm sorry Mousse," Genma said again. But the Necromancer was silent. In fact, he wasn't moving at all except for his lips.<p>Genma's eyes opened wide. "No, Mousse. Don't do it. Don't DO IT!"<p>"What is he trying to do?" Ryoga yelled.<p>"He's trying to cast Revive," Genma said. He reached forward and tried to grab Mousse to stop him but suddenly he was flying backwards, landing several feet from where Mousse was.<p>"Pop!" Ranma yelled as they all ran over to where Genma was. The air around Mousse crackled with energy. Tendrils of black smoke began to lift from the ground and circle around him.<p>Genma stood up. "YOU CAN'T REVIVE A HUMAN!" he yelled. But he could barely yell over the growing windstorm. The group had to shield themselves as the wind began to pelt them with debris from the ground.<p>Despite the maelstrom around him, nothing on Mousse moved. Shampoo's hair was tussled in the wind, her clothing acting like a stormy sea. Mousse's lips continued to move, feeding the spell until it reached its maximum power.<p>The wind started to die down. The group of fighters slowly turned to face back towards where Mousse and Shampoo were. Genma was up first, almost running to get there.<p>"You idiot!" he screamed. "Reviving a human only gives you a zombie! How could you do that to…" He stopped short, frozen by what he saw.<p>"What is it, Pop?" Ranma asked as everyone converged on him.<p>Ranma looked down, almost afraid of what he would see. But there was no zombie Shampoo. Her skin was a healthy pink, the wounds from her battle were fading. The hole in her chest was gone, replaced with a patch of pink skin that rose and fell at a steady pace.<p>"How…" he started.<p>"It's not possible," Genma said. "A Revive spell… it's not possible."<p>Mousse placed a hand on Shampoo's cheek. "You're right," he said. Hesitatingly, he leaned down and planted a delicate kiss on her forehead. "It's not possible."<p>He stood up and walked away from the group. "It's not possible," he said, "unless you know who to ask for a favor."<p>"A favor?" Genma asked.<p>Mousse sighed and closed his eyes. "Take care of her for me."<p>Before anyone could move, the ground underneath him began to crackle and burn. Flames jutted upwards, engulfing him in a wave of fire. There was one anguished scream before the fire suddenly went out and all that was left was a charred piece of ground.
