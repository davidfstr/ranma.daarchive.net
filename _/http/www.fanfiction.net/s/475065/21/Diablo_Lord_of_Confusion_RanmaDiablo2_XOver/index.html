</div>Author's note:<p>Well, I found my LOC CD and decided to have a go at it. Imagine my surprise when I found my battlenet account still active! So it's been two night of running good old AkaneS around most of Act Five. Funny thing is, I have a barbarian mercenary and in true Ryoga fashion, he keeps getting lost!<p>Thanks for the reviews, Gohan, I am still laughing at yours. ^_^ Anyway, cat is fine, creativity is high because we're going to hell next so what can I say! I hope you're enjoying this as much as I am!<p>Act 3, Quest 6<p>The Guardian<p>"Shampoo!"<p>Looking up, she watched the blue haired woman looked down at her. Her green eyes sparkled as she smiled. She reached down and Shampoo suddenly felt herself being lifted it.<p>"Shampoo, how did you get into that box?"<p>Shampoo looked down and watched the wooden box fade from view as she was pulled back into the embrace of someone very familiar. There was a giggle of amusement as Shampoo pulled lightly on a curl of blue hair.<p>"She's so strong!"<p>"Yes grand daughter. And she will get stronger, stronger than any of us."<p>That voice… it was familiar. The scene shifted and suddenly Shampoo found herself being handed over to Cologne. She let out a sound of protest but it came out as a cry.<p>"What's the matter great-grand daughter?" Cologne said, smiling. Her face crinkled beneath the many layers of wrinkles. Shampoo let out another cry.  She wanted to go back to the other woman.<p>"Here, let me take her." And then Shampoo was back in the hands of the blue haired woman. "I think you may have frightened her."<p>Cologne let out a laugh. "Of course, I frighten all children! But this one, she does not cry from fear. She's too courageous for that. Have you thought of a name?"<p>"Xian Pu. After her grandmother."<p>Cologne nodded. "Thank you. I know my daughter would have been honored."<p>* * *<p>"Shampoo?" Ukyo said, taking the Amazon's hand in her own. "Can you hear me?" She waited, watching Shampoo's chest rise and follow in slow succession. With a sigh, Ukyo put her hand down and stood up.<p>There was a crackling in the woods and Ukyo took a defensive stance. But it was only Ryoga and Ranma. And from the looks on their faces, they had failed in their quest. Ukyo let out a disappointed sigh.<p>"Nothing?" she asked. The two boys looked at each other and shook their heads. Ukyo shook her head. "I guess we shouldn't be surprised."<p>"We'll find him," Ranma said firmly. "It's got to be some cheap trick or something."<p>"If that were only the case, then perhaps the unpleasantness to follow could be avoided. But I fear that it is already too late."<p>Turning, the trio watched as Cologne and Soun appeared, followed by Genma, Akane and Shinnosuke who seemed unhurt from their journey back to Kurast. Cologne looked older, if that was possible, as she looked upon the sleeping form of her great granddaughter.<p>"Then they were telling the truth," she said softly. "What a tragedy."<p>"Do you know where Mousse is?" Ranma asked.<p>Cologne nodded slowly. "If the story is true, then I am afraid he made a deal with his demon lord in exchange for Shampoo's life."<p>"His demon lord?" Ukyo asked.<p>"Come now," Cologne said, "did you really believe that a man who could raise the dead and create bones out of thin air was on the side of good?"<p>"Mousse never gave us a reason to doubt him," Ranma said, suddenly very firm in his stance. He had been the first to distrust Mousse because of his class but since then, he had seen him perform many feats against the evil that was hunting them.<p>"Really?" Cologne said. "He out of all of you knew the most about what was hunting you down. He knew more about the ancient history of this land. Did it never strike you that maybe he was not telling us everything?"<p>"I don't believe it," Ranma said firmly. "You just never liked him."<p>"True, and I like him less for what he has done now."<p>"He saved your great granddaughter," Ukyo cried. "Doesn't that prove he is noble enough?"<p>"Child, you have no idea of what you speak. Shampoo would have been better off dead, more honored in her tribe for dying in battle. Now she is forever indebted to the man who saved her life. A man, who by all accounts, have made a deal with the devil and is more than likely a demon himself now. Considering the paths you have chosen, how long will it be before you cross paths with him again? You have seen his magic when he can make it work correctly. How do you intend to go against that?"<p>"That's just crazy," Ryoga said. "We've spent the last few months fighting together. He would never…"<p>Cologne shook her head. "You still don't understand." She lifted her head to the sky. "But I am afraid you soon will. You have collected the items you need and thus I will give you my last word of advice. Place them in the Horadric cube and allow them to reassemble. Use this is a key to open the gate and there you will face the demon you seek."<p>"Your last advice?" Akane asked.<p>"Yes. I must travel home to tell my tribe of what has happened here. The danger continues to grow and we must prepare for battle."<p>"What about…" Ukyo said softly, looking down at the sleeping Amazon.<p>"She is dead to her tribe," Cologne said. "That is my last gift to her. To be no longer bound by Amazon law and not have to face being ostracized by her peers for being rescued by a man."<p>"That's so cruel," Akane said.<p>"Is it dear?" Cologne said with a smile. "The tribe will remember her as a great hero and Shampoo will be free."<p>"But everyone will think she is dead," Ukyo said.<p>"Sometimes," Cologne said. "It is better to be thought of as dead, then to be thought of as a betrayer to your ideals."<p>* * *<p>Shampoo heard a giggle coming from her mother's room. She quietly slipped out of her bed and padded barefoot on the floor. Walking up to the bedroom door, she saw the flame of a candle flickering inside. She carefully pushed the door open and squinted as the light hit her eyes.<p>As soon as her vision cleared, she saw her mother lying in the embrace of a man, a man who was not her father. They were laughing and her mother was smiling, something she rarely did when Shampoo's father was around. Her mother was so oblivious to the world as she stared into this stranger's eyes. But in her gaze, Shampoo saw familiarity, happiness and a look she had only given her daughter. It must have been love.<p>The front door swung open and Shampoo looked down the hallway, recognizing her father's figure there. He threw down a dead animal, having arrived home from his weekly hunt.<p>"Go! You have to go now!"<p>Shampoo turned and watched as her mother quickly shoved the other man from out of the bed. The two scrambled to get their things together as Shampoo's father's feet pounded down the hallway.<p>Shampoo faded into a corner, hiding in the shadows as she watched the scene unfold. It was a race to see how if they could be gone before her father reached the door. However, from what she could see, it was a race they were going to lose. Somewhere in her mind she knew she had to do something but fear paralyzed her.<p>Her father reached the door just as her mother was pushing her lover out the window. With an angry cry, her father leapt forward, grabbing the other man's leg and dragging him back instead.<p>"Don't touch him!" Shampoo's mother screamed. But her father gave her a firm push to the wall and she fell to the ground.<p>"You think to fight me? The one who bested you in combat!" he cried. "And what is this?" He said pointing to the other man. "This is what you wanted? A weakling who has been deemed by this entire tribe as worthless!"<p>"He's worth more than you ever will be!" she screamed. Carefully she moved her hand across the wall and towards the pile of spears kept in the corner.<p>"Two worthless pieces of trash," her father cried. "You are made for each other. But you belong to me and I'll make sure you remember that."<p>With a quickly movement, he brought out his hunting knife, still covered in blood from the hunt and swung across, slicing the man's neck. With a strangled cry, Shampoo's mother moved, grabbing a spear and ramming it into her husband's side. Second later, both men lay dead.<p>Her blue hair plaster to her head, her eyes red with tears, Shampoo watched her mother stand and walk over to the body of her lover. "You may have not been able to win me in a fight," she said softly, "but you won me every other way."<p>She reached up and grabbed the hunting knife from the ground. With one last sob, she placed the knife on her heart and rammed it through.<p>* * *<p>"Now what?" Ranma asked.<p>Genma paused and looked at the box. "I have no idea," he said after several moments of silence.<p>"Allow me, old friend," Soun said leaning forward. With a few deft motions, he locked the box up and spun it once. Several rays of light burst from the sides of the box and illuminated the area for a moment before fading.<p>Soun opened the box and a Flail appeared. "Kikyo's flail," he said.<p>"Excellent, Tendo," Genma said.<p>"I do know a few things, Saotome."<p>"So what now?" Akane asked.<p>Genma picked up the flail. "We figure out how to use this and move on."<p>"Well, most of you move on," Soun said. "Kuno has already said that he will remain in Kurast until he can be sure that the evil will not reach his shores."<p>"Uh huh," Genma said. "And you, dear friend. Will you remain with Nabiki as well?"<p>Soun paused and shook his head. "She's in good hands. And I fell like something is calling me onward."<p>"I'll come with you too," Tofu said, as he joined the group from the jungle. "Too many leaders in Kurast right now."<p>"You'll be a great addition," Akane said with a smile. But it started to fade. "Where's Shinnosuke?"<p>Tofu sighed. "He's going to stay in Kurast and watch over his grandfather and the rest of the crew. Kuno has already offered them his own vessel as a replacement for the one they lost. So I wouldn't doubt if they left here shortly. He asked me to give you this."<p>Tofu held out a folded letter and handed it to Akane. She took it in her hands. "Thank you," she said softly. She looked at it for a moment and then stood up. "Excuse me."<p>Ranma watched her go and then turned back to the group, hiding the disappointment in his eyes. Turning back he tried to concentrate on the flail but it wasn't working. "I'll get the others and we'll start looking for someplace to use this thing."<p>* * *<p>Shampoo packed her bag and tested the weight against her shoulder. It was heavy but she would manage. Besides, considering how far she had to travel, she was sure she would develop the muscles to carry it soon.<p>"Are you leaving so soon?"<p>Shampoo turned and saw Cologne at the door. "I thought it was better to leave here quickly."<p>"An Amazon should not show fear," Cologne said.<p>"It's not fear," Shampoo snapped.<p>"He almost beat you this time," Cologne said. "And considering the line of suitors waiting to challenge you, you know that it is only a matter of time before one of them wins. But running away…"<p>"I'm not running away!" Shampoo cried. "I'm fifteen and like many young Amazons, I want to make a name for myself in the world before I settle down. Is that so hard to understand?"<p>"They usually do that fighting in wars. But there are no wars now."<p>"I'll just do a few quests."<p>"Your common speech is lacking."<p>"I'll learn!"<p>"Are you that determined?" Cologne asked.<p>Shampoo picked up the bag. Cologne was right, she was running away. Partly because she didn't want to have to get married. But partly because she couldn't take the whispers anymore. The High Council had buried her parents' death by saying they were attacked by the other man and died protecting her. But everyone knew the story was fake considering who the attacker was supposed to be.<p>"Yes," Shampoo said, grabbing her spear.<p>"Then I'll come with you."<p>Shampoo stopped. "Why?"<p>"To make sure you stay out of trouble."<p>* * *<p>"What the hell is that?" Ryoga said.<p>Ukyo turned to where he was pointing. In the back of one of the stone temples, there was a flicker blue light. She walked over carefully and examined the area, making sure that there were no monsters. As soon as she was sure, she motioned Ryoga to follow her.<p>"What is it?" he asked as they approached the glowing orb.<p>"I don't know… but it feels wrong."<p>Ryoga nodded. "I'm getting the same feeling." He hefted his axe up and was about to bring it down.<p>"Ryoga, no!" Ukyo cried.<p>But she was too late. Ryoga swung his axe downward, hitting the orb right on the center. There was an explosion of sparks that made Ukyo flinch. When her eyes cleared, she saw Ryoga lying on the ground.<p>"Oww…" was all he managed.<p>Ukyo looked back at the orb. "I'm going to go get the others."<p>* * *<p>The pub was packed with people. Shampoo and Cologne barely found a table in the back. Waving the waiter over, Cologne ordered three dinners and some drinks. Shampoo put her gear down on the floor next to her. In the year since she had started traveling, she had developed the muscles to carry her pack with ease. And quite a few scars to remind her that strength did not always win a fight.<p>"So he said he would meet us here?" Shampoo asked.<p>Cologne nodded. "That's what the note said."<p>"I told you an ad at the town hall would work," Shampoo said with a smile. "We just need a job or two to get some money and then we can continue questing."<p>Cologne raised an eyebrow. She wanted to say something, like shouldn't we be going home, but decided against it. Besides, a shadowy figure was attempting to get to them and Cologne figured it was the man who needed them.<p>"Are you Cologne?" he asked, reaching their table.<p>"Yes, and this is my great granddaughter Shampoo."<p>The man nodded and sat down. The food arrived then and they all began to eat. "So what do you want us to do," Cologne said between mouthfuls.<p>"I need help getting home. The roads are becoming more treacherous and…"<p>"You need protection," Shampoo said. "Shampoo can provide." Cologne cringed. A year in the outside world had improved her daughter's language skills minimally.<p>"Yes, protection." He reached forward to take the mug of ale and Cologne saw something on his wrist. Her eyes opened wide and she snapped her hand forward, grabbing the young man's hand.<p>"Necromancer!" she said, recognizing the bracelet around him.<p>"What?" Shampoo asked.<p>"Don't take the job," Cologne said reverting back to the Amazon language. "We don't want any of his kind."<p>"Why not?" Shampoo asked. "Besides, we need the money."<p>"Not this badly."<p>"Really? How do you plan to pay for this meal?" Cologne was about to say something more but Shampoo jumped ahead of her.<p>"We take job," she said, holding out her hand. "Take man back home. 10,000 gold?"<p>The man balked but nodded. He slowly removed his hood, revealing the black hood of hair and pale skin. He took her hand and shook it. "Deal."<p>Leaning forward, he examined her and started to smile. "Wow, you are a babe!"<p>"WHAT YOU SAY?"<p>* * *<p>"Shampoo?"<p>Shampoo's eyes flickered open and she saw Ukyo's face come into focus. "Ukyo?"<p>"Shampoo! You're awake!"<p>"Shampoo no dead?"<p>There was dead silence. "No," Ukyo said. "No, you're not." There was shuffling as the rest of the group converged around the Amazon. She slowly stood up and looked around.<p>"Hey! You look as good as new," Ranma said.<p>"Ranma!" Akane said, jamming an elbow into his ribs. "Are you feeling all right, Shampoo?"<p>"Tired," Shampoo said. "There was monster…"<p>"It's dead," Ranma said. "They're all dead."<p>Shampoo nodded and slowly stood up. She looked around the group. "Where everyone?"<p>There was a pained silence before Akane spoke up. "Shinnosuke went back to Kurast. Kuno's going to stay there but Tofu is going to join us. So is my dad."<p>Shampoo nodded but something still felt wrong. "Where Mousse?" Silence. "He stay in Kurast too?"<p>No one could find the words. Ukyo stepped forward and took Shampoo's arm in her hand. "Shampoo…"<p>"No," Shampoo shook her head suddenly realizing what was going on. "No say that. No say that. Mousse is Kurast, right? He stay there because always in way…"<p>But no one said anything. No one had the heart to.<p>* * *<p>Ryoga sat gripping his axe tightly. Stupid orb. His head was still swimming from the last hit. Maybe just one more…<p>Ryoga stopped himself. No way was he going to go through the embarrassment of having his axe bounced off that thing. Whatever it was, though, Ryoga had a burning desire to see it smashed into little bits.<p>There were footsteps and Ryoga jumped upwards, instantly regretting it. He held his axe as best he could but the world was swimming. As soon as his vision cleared, he realized that it wasn't monsters approaching him, but the rest of the party. Waving, he couldn't help but notice Shampoo had rejoined them.<p>Ukyo walked up to him and nodded slowly. "We told her everything except what Cologne said."<p>"What happened?" Ryoga asked.<p>Ukyo shrugged. "She just kind of got silent." Ryoga frowned. "Any luck with the orb?"<p>Ryoga looked at her with a raised eyebrow. "You actually think I'd touch that thing again."<p>"Well, seeing as you did hit it the first time after I said not to…"<p>Akane watched as the two bickered with a sad smile. She led Shampoo to the edge of the stone staircase. She turned and looked to where her father, Tofu, and Genma were examining the Flail.<p>"I think we should look for a key hole," Ranma said walking up to her. "There was one for the Horadric staff. Maybe there's one for the Flail."<p>Akane looked over at Shampoo who sat silently and looked out at the horizon, seeing nothing. After a moment's pause, she nodded and followed Ranma up the stairs.<p>Shampoo wasn't looking at anything, Akane was right about that. Or at least she wasn't looking at anything tangible. She was watching scenes play through her mind.<p>Mousse walking into a wall. Mousse walking into a pond. Mousse talking to a statue for several hours thinking it was her. Mousse casting a Bone Spear and nearly missing her. Stupid Mousse. Always running into things. Causing her to get cursed. Trying to get her attentions with stupid flowers and rings and amulets and gems. Always spouting stupid romantic sentences. Always professing his undying love.<p>"Ah… Shampoo?" Tofu asked, watching the Amazon's expression change from disbelief to rage. Her hands clenched to her side with such ferocity that she drawing blood from her palms. Her anger so deep that she was shaking.<p>Genma and Soun looked up just in time to see her stand up and stride towards them. They backed up instinctively and thought she was going to attack them. Reaching down, she took the flail and gripped it in her hands, ignoring the pain as its metal handle dug into the new wounds.<p>"Shampoo, wait," Tofu said, trying to stop her. But she just shoved him back to the ground.<p>She strode up the stairs, alarming the rest of the party who was still searching for the keyhole. Shampoo strode with a purpose, she knew exactly what had to be done. That orb was evil, all of this area was evil. And it was time to put a stop to it.<p>Reaching the orb, she lifted the flail and let out an Amazonian war cry. Ryoga grimaced as it came down, thinking of what the shock would be to her.  But when the cloud of sparks cleared, the orb was destroyed.<p>"What the…" Ryoga started. But he never had the chance to finish. The floor beneath him buckled and he found himself tumbling down a flight of stairs.<p>"Ryoga! Are you okay?"<p>"Oww…"<p>* * *<p>"I think we just found something worse than a Amazon with a hang over," Ryoga whispered to Ranma. Ranma merely nodded as he watched Shampoo stride down the hallway.<p>A monster suddenly leaped from the darkness found itself slashed in two before its feet even touched the ground. Three more creatures tried to attack but each fell to the ground with a cracked skull before they could even realize what was going on.<p>"I kind of feel useless," Tofu said with a hushed tone.<p>"Yeah, have you noticed how things are actually avoiding us," Ukyo said.<p>"I wouldn't blame them," Ranma said watching Shampoo take out a few more demons.<p>"Hell, I want to run away," Ryoga said under his breath.<p>There was an earsplitting crackle as a wooden door collapsed under Shampoo's assault. She began her descent down the stairs but was caught by Ranma.<p>"Now wait a minute," he said firmly.<p>"Let go," she said, trying to pull free.<p>"No way. I think we can all feel the evil feeling that is just crawling all over the stairs leading down."<p>"NO matter. Shampoo kill what down there."<p>"Whatever is down there is going to kill you unless you think this through."<p>"Shampoo no care!" she said. "Shampoo know great grand mother leave. Shampoo know what that mean. Shampoo dead already."<p>"No you're not," Ranma said firmly. "You've just been given another shot at things. And okay, so maybe it's not under the ideal circumstances, and maybe it involves a lot of things you don't like or would rather disappear." He shot a look over to Akane. "But sometimes, things work out and it's even better than you hoped. My friend gave up his so you can have another chance. So I'm not going to let you throw it all."<p>Shampoo's anger crumpled a bit. And she smiled. "Great grand mother right. Ranma is better leader."<p>Ranma nodded firmly. He looked over at Ukyo. "Can you go scout?"<p>"Sure thing, sugar," Ukyo said, creeping down the stairs.<p>As soon as she was gone, Shampoo looked back at Ranma. "Ranma make choice no? Shampoo see it." She looked over at Akane. "Shampoo no longer Amazon, no longer bound to Amazon law, to any Amazon law," she said looking back at Ranma. Ranma nodded, understanding what she meant.<p>Ukyo reappeared, looking rather worried. "There are a bunch of real high level nasties down there. But that's not what I'm worried about."<p>"What else is down there?" Ranma asked watching her expression warily.<p>"It's a guy. He looked normal enough, kind of cute. Only he's sitting on this throne and nothing is touching him. It's kind of eerie."<p>"Shampoo take him," she said firmly. "If Ranma and others take rest of monsters, Shampoo can find out what he is."<p>Ranma paused and looked at the purple haired warrior. "Okay," he said after a moment's hesitation. "We'll do it that way. Only you better be careful."<p>"Shampoo be careful," she said with a smile. "Shampoo be very careful."<p>* * *<p>Pantyhouse Taro watched as his minions clambered around him. They were tiring to control and he would have given anything to follow his brother into the portal. But his brother had told him to wait.<p>"Taro," Herb said appearing by his side. "My master wants you to know that he has penetrated the angels' stronghold and has begun his march on hell."<p>"Excellent," Taro said. "I can't wait to join him. It's a shame that he believes these humans to be such a problem."<p>"They have caused us problems in the past," Herb said with poison in his voice, remembering the Amazon that had speared him. "But we have finally made them pay an ultimate price by taking one of their own."<p>Taro sighed. "Whatever. I care not for the mortal world. I just want to get this over with…"<p>His minions scattered and Taro smiled. "Tell my brother, I will join him shortly." Herb nodded and disappeared. Taro stood up and watched as the assault began. The mortals were making headway but it was nothing that his minions couldn't handle.<p>"You."<p>Taro blinked and looked down, coming face to face with a young purple haired girl. "Yes?" he answered, finding himself using an archaic language. Amazonian if he was correct. "What do you want?"<p>"I want to make you pay," Shampoo said evenly.<p>"Pay? For what? Wait… this has something to do with…"<p>"You took something from me, from us that was very valuable."<p>Taro smiled. "The one we took from you? Well I am sorry, but he's not here. He's my brother's play thing right now."<p>Shampoo shifted the weight of the flail in her hand. "He's not a plaything, you despicable creature."<p>Taro flinched. "Girl, you have no idea who you are dealing with. Save you insults for a creature that you can actually fight."<p>"I'll fight you," Shampoo said. "I'll fight you and your brother and everyone it takes to rid the world of this evil."<p>Taro frowned, his anger growing. "This is your last chance," he said evenly. "I am not someone you want to make angry."<p>Shampoo glared at him and smiled slightly. She leapt forward, striking out with the flail and landing a clean blow against Taro's cheek. He stumbled backwards, a bit shocked and reached an arm up to his cheek. Seeing the blood, Taro's eyes went black.<p>"I will make you pay for that," he said, his voice deepening with every syllable. His body shifted and began to grow a set of demon wings coming out of his back. His face morphed from a young man into that of a bull. Turning to Shampoo, he let out a cry of rage that shook the very walls of the underground temple.<p>Shampoo clinched the flail tighter but didn't move. He took a step forward, his footstep causing the floor underneath her to wobble as he did.  Shampoo took the chance and used the momentum to leap upward and strike at his head.<p>But Taro countered and sent her sprawling across the ground. "Foolish mortal. Did you really think you could best one of the three brothers."<p>Shampoo stood up and held the flail again, taking an offensive stance. He turned to face her just as she leapt again, aiming for the midsection. Taro was unprepared for the blow and had to step back as the shot winded him. Shampoo wasted no time and quickly hit him on the back, landing a second blow and drawing blood.<p>Taro screamed in rage, bloodlust over taking whatever human traits he had. He swung an arm forward but Shampoo dodged and let the flail crash onto his wrist, destroying the bones there.<p>Twirling the spike orb on its chain, she spun around and let the flail catch him in the eye. Taro fell backwards, now blinded and in extreme pain. Shampoo never let up. She just kept striking the beast, each blow rendering him less and less capable of returning the attack.<p>Finally, she smashed the flail into his knee and his leg collapsed. Broken, bleeding and on the floor, the demon Taro looked up at her and smiled. "My brother will make you pay. He will keep the one you lost imprisoned for eternity and he will torture you for longer. He will let you and your friends roast in the fires of Hell itself for this!"<p>"Maybe," Shampoo said. "But you will burn first."<p>With a mighty swing, she brought the flail down, connecting with his skull and making a sickening crunch as it connected with his skull. The flail shattered on impact but took Taro's life as well.<p>Shampoo sank to the ground and looked at the dead demon, realizing that the kill had done nothing to alleviate her suffering. Ranma and the rest of the group arrived moments later, beaten from their fight but still standing.<p>"It's over," Ranma said.<p>"No," Shampoo replied. "Is not over. Demon say he one of three brothers. We only kill one, two more left."<p>"But where…"<p>As if to answer him, there was a bubbling sound to their right. As they ran over to see what it was, they watched with a mix of horror and awe as a bridge of bones emerged from the river of blood. A red portal suddenly appeared, much as it had when they were in Lut Gholeim.<p>"Shampoo think we go there," she said pointing to the portal. No one could disagree and they each carefully walked across the bridge of bones into the unknown.
