</div>"Hey! Wait for me!" Akane called out.<p>It had been a slow march for days and it shouldn't have been a surprise that her companions would take off now that Lut Gholein was so close. The moment that the town's walls had emerged over a distant sand dune, they had been steadily increasing their pace. Now with it only several hundred meters away, the younger members of the caravan had broken out into a run, leaving their camels behind.<p>"Last one there cooks dinner!" Ukyo called out, smiling as she passed by Shampoo.<p>"Shampoo no cook for pig boys!"<p>"What did you just call me?" Ryoga said, taking off after the disappearing Amazon, drawing his axe.<p>"She meant all of us!" Mousse called out, trying to catch up with Ryoga before he made good use of that axe.<p>Akane took a few steps and slowed down. She actually would love to cook dinner for everyone and now she would just happen to lose and get the chance. But before she could plan anymore, she felt herself swept off the ground.<p>"Ain't no way we're coming in last," Ranma said as he took off, carrying Akane in his arms. Akane had the decency to blush momentarily before she began cheering.<p>"Come on Ranma, pick up the pace!" she called.<p>"HEY! NO FAIR!" Ukyo cried watching them pass her. She paused long enough to grab Ryoga as he tried to pass. "Move it, Barbarian!" she said clambering on to his back.<p>"What do I look like!" Ryoga cried, without really slowing down.<p>"Ryoga look like mule with lumpy sack on back!" Shampoo laughed as she passed them.<p>"Who are you calling a mule!"<p>"Who are you calling a lumpy sack!"<p>"Shampoo, let me carry the burden of us both and lead us to victory!"<p>"No chance duck-boy."<p>"Ryoga, come on! We're going to lose! Catch up with them and I'll take out Akane, while you deal with Shampoo!"<p>Ryoga nodded and took off, the light weight of Ukyo not really making a difference in speed.<p>"WRONG WAY!" Ukyo screamed as Ryoga veered away.<p>"Pick it up, Ranma," Akane called out.<p>Ranma looked over and saw Ryoga catching up. "Hang on, we need to switch..." Before Akane could protest the thought he unceremoniously flipped her over his shoulder and onto his back.<p>"Hey Akane!" Ukyo yelled as they came up close.<p>Akane turned in time to see Ukyo hand reached out. She blocked it quickly and followed up with a series of more blocks as Ukyo tried to push her off of Ranma's back. Akane managed to get a good hold on Ukyo's hand and pulled her forward trying to unbalance her.<p>It worked and Ryoga and Ukyo tumble, sending up a pile of sand as they did. Ranma stopped long enough to celebrate.<p>"Way to go Akane," he said, giving her a high five.<p>"Yeah, it looks we won't be the last ones there," she giggled watching, Ukyo and Ryoga begin to argue with each other.<p>"So long as you're not cooking, everyone will win," Ranma said with a laugh. And then he realized he had just said that out loud. Carefully he let Akane slide off his back. "Ah, I really didn't mean to say that out loud... I mean, I didn't mean to say that at all!"<p>Akane eyebrow twitched and the air around her grew very hot.<p>"Ranma..." she growled. "NO BAKA!" she finished, giving him a big wallop into the air.<p>Shampoo and Mousse stopped to help Ryoga and Ukyo up out of the sand since it was quite obvious that Ranma was going to be the last one in town.<p>From the distance, Genma and Soun nodded at each other with a small smile. "Looks like things are getting back to normal."<p>* * *<p>"Stupid Akane," Ranma-chan said as she walked back to town. How she managed to hit the one puddle of water in the entire desert was a mystery but it was right in line with the type of day he was having.<p>"I ain't cooking nuthing," Ranma-chan continued as she entered town. "It's all her fault anyway, so it should be her problem." She paused and realized what she had just said. She was about to continue on her way when she was unceremoniously glomped from behind.<p>"What beauty doth enter my humble town? Her face shines more brightly then the sun and her red hair burns brighter. That I would have the chance to but..."<p>"Hands off creep!" Ranma-chan cried, planting a well placed back fist in to the stranger's face. The guy collapsed and she turned around, finding a crumpled pile of robes on the ground.<p>"My love doth have a bit of a temper..." came a voice from the pile.<p>"Jerk," Ranma-chan said before taking off to find the rest of his group. What the hell! Could this day get any worse?<p>The rest of the group was already unpacking when he reached them. A bunch of traders were surrounding them, trying to buy what the caravan had brought while trying to sell some of the local goods.<p>"Wow, what a hottie."<p>"Yeah look at her body."<p>"Excuse me?" Ranma-chan said, whipping around to see who had the death wish now. Two guys, his age, dressed in desert robes and overloaded with what looked like potions were staring at him. "Are you looking for a fight?"<p>"Woah," one of them said. "Sorry, didn't realize you were one of those."<p>"Yeah, what a waste."<p>"What?" Ranma-chan said. "What the hell are you two talking about?"<p>"Well," one of them continued. "It's pretty obvious that if you're not giving us the time of day, you must like girls."<p>"Of course I like girls! I'm a guy!" Ranma-chan said.<p>"Yeah, yeah. Of course you are honey."<p>Ranma-chan got extraordinarily flustered until she realized what was wrong. "Oh, you think I'm a girl because I look like a girl!"<p>"That's how it works."<p>"Hang on... let me find some hot water or something," Ranma-chan said, walking away.<p>"Here," one of the boys said, holding out a water skin. "Hot water. Good to have when you're in our line of work."<p>Ranma-chan snatched it and poured it over his head. A second later, the transformation took place and a triumphant Ranma stood in front of them. "See!" he said.<p>One of the young men paled considerably and began babbling incoherently. The other at least had the decency to faint. Ranma sighed and realized that he couldn't just leave them here.<p>* * *<p>"Thanks again," the potion seller said as Ranma handed him a bowl of soup. "It really was just a shock."<p>"Try to look at it from my perspective," he replied. "The name's Ranma Saotome, Paladin level 7."<p>"I'm Hiroshi, the one who fainted is Daisuke. We're Potion makers and sellers, natives of Lut Gholein. "<p>"Nice to meet you. Will he be okay?" Ranma asked, looking over at the crumpled boy.<p>"Yeah, he'll sleep it off for a while." Hiroshi said taking in a drink. "So about the whole sex change thing..."<p>"It's not like that!" Ranma exclaimed. With a long sigh, he began to relate the story of the past few months, mentioning his curse, their adventures with the Rouges and finally the journey East, though he left out most of the things about Akane.<p>It was strange, Ranma thought as he finally stopped talking long enough to let Hiroshi process all the information. Akane didn't seem different most of the time but then there were times that she was a world away.<p>"Man, so you really go to meet the old Seer of the West?" Hiroshi finally asked. "Was she like all the stories?"<p>"What stories!" Ranma cried. "What the hell is it with this seer?"<p>Hiroshi leaned in close and began to whisper. "Well, you see, story is that she..."<p>"RANMA!"<p>Ranma jumped and looked over his shoulder to where his father was standing.<p>"I'm right here, you didn't have to YELL!" Ranma yelled.<p>"I called you at least seven times," Genma said. "Let's go. Us and the Tendos are going to go talk to whoever runs this place and see what's what. Most of the rest of them have gone off to hunt for clues to a cure."<p>"Oh man, why can't we just hunt for the cure ourselves!"<p>"Because it would be impolite to come here and not introduce ourselves."<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow. "Yeah right. How much money are you going to get?"<p>Genma looked hurt but before he could respond, Soun and Akane bounded up to join the group.<p>"Are we ready?" Akane said with a huge smile. She had taken the free time to redo her hair and change to a new outfit. She looked kind of pretty this way, all happy and...<p>"Come on!" she said impatiently, not realizing why Ranma was dawdling. "Let's get going!"<p>"Why are you so excited anyway?" Ranma asked, a bit unnerved by his last train of though.<p>"Are you kidding!" Akane said. "This is where some of the greatest sorceresses come from! I want to ask the leader where they are." She grabbed his hand and started to pull. "So let's move!"<p>"Okay, okay," Ranma said, getting dragged away but not making any obvious moves to pull away from her grasp. The move didn't escape Soun and Genma who looked at each other, nodded slightly with satisfaction and then giggled like little school girls before taking off after the group.<p>Hiroshi sighed and started to eat his soup. Just as he did, Daisuke shot up. "What'd I miss?" he asked.<p>* * *<p>"Oh man, this is not what I meant when I asked you to help me look for items that might be a cure," Ryoga said collapsing to the ground, holding several bags in his hands.<p>"Well, you never know if we might get lucky," Ukyo said, walking up to the shop owner.<p>"Look, this is fun and all but I really want to start looking for a cure."<p>Ukyo sighed and looked at the dealer. "Do you have the cure?" The shop owner looked at her and shook her head. Ukyo motioned to the owner for Ryoga and then turned back. "Okay, do you have any saffron?"<p>"Of course! This is a spice shop!" the owner said. "I have a wide variety of spices."<p>"Yeah, just like the last fifty places we've been too," Ryoga muttered under his breath.<p>"But my quality is much better I assure you!" the owner said enthusiastically.<p>Ryoga sighed and fell back to the ground. He stared at the ceiling and tried to recount exactly how he had gotten into this situation. Here he was too damn weak when it came to a pretty face.<p>"Ooooh, look at that scarf!" Ukyo said, pointing to a dark red scarf that was wrapped around a stone bust. "It would be perfect for Ranma-honey!" She reached into her pocket and pulled out her money pouch but found it was nearly empty.<p>"Ryoga?"<p>"Yeah," Ryoga said not looking up.<p>"Can I borrow some money? I really want to buy that scarf for Ranma."<p>"No way!" Ryoga said sitting up, instantly regretting it as Ukyo was leaning in front of him. "Not for Ranma, of all people."<p>"But sugar," Ukyo said with a smile, "if I buy this for Ranma, he'll be so grateful that he'll have to take me out for dinner and then you can take Akane out."<p>Ryoga huffed. "What makes you think I would want to take Akane out?"<p>Ukyo rolled her eyes. "Come on, like it's not completely obvious you're in love with the girl. You think I missed the way you watched over every night when she was out of it. Or how you always look at her when you know she's not looking."<p>"It's not true!" Ryoga said indignantly, knowing, full well, it was.<p>"What about last night? In your sleep?" Ukyo batted her eyes and pursed her lips. "Akane... Akane... why don't you take off that wet shirt and..."<p>Ryoga's eyes opened wide. He grabbed a nearby pillow and shoved it at Ukyo's mouth. "Quiet!" he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his purse, tossing it at Ukyo's direction.<p>"Feh," he said. "It's not like I won't get more."<p>"Thanks sugar!" Ukyo said with a grin and a quick hug. Ryoga tried to remain angry but a smile start to peek through his frown.<p>While Ukyo bought the rest of her purchases, Ryoga picked the rest of the bags up. He wouldn't get the chance to do much cure-hunting today, it seemed. Hopefully the other group would have more success.<p>As he was about to leave, Ryoga paused. Did that basket just move? He started to move towards it but Ukyo grabbed his arm and pulled him away. With a shrug, he decided it was just a mirage.<p>As soon as they were gone, however, the basket began to hope after them.<p>* * *<p>Cologne nodded slowly. "Yes of course, I understand. It was just I was hoping for something."<p>The older woman nodded. "I think its best that you continue on to Travincal. There is a great healer there who might be able to help."<p>"I will take that into consideration. Thank you." Cologne stood up and grabbed her staff hopping out of the tiny house. She had hoped for a better answer than this. Shampoo would be most disappointed to hear the news.<p>"Shampoo can no do."<p>Cologne stopped just short of where the two were. Shampoo was standing up, holding her spear to the ground.<p>"You're not concentrating enough," Mousse said, an open book on his lap. "It says that you need to concentrate on the sky and draw the power from it."<p>"That what Shampoo do!" Shampoo cried. "This so stupid. Shampoo no get magic to work. Not right type of girl. Better fight with spear."<p>"Just try," Mousse said patiently. "No one can learn a spell over night."<p>Shampoo paused and took in a deep breath. She held up her spear to the sky and concentrated as best she could, trying to feel the air and find the source of power that would let her...<p>"That's it!" Mousse cried.<p>Shampoo looked and saw the tiniest spark coming from the tip of her spear. But the second she broke her concentration, it sputtered and disappeared. She cursed and threw her hand up in the air.<p>"That was very good, great-granddaughter, " Cologne said, hopping forward. "Where did you learn that?"<p>"I found a book about Zerae," Mousse said. "And it contained some basic instruction on how to cast lightning spells."<p>"Impressive," Cologne said. "Go on girl, try again." Shampoo nodded and hesitantly held up her spear. Cologne looked over at Mousse with a sly smile.<p>"Nice move, trying to teach her a new trick."<p>Mousse's eyes didn't stray from the page. "It's not a move," he said evenly. "I was just trying to help."<p>Cologne nodded. "Well, so long as you understand she's not yours now or will she ever be."<p>Mousse face twitched. "I'm really that bad, aren't I?"<p>Cologne sighed. "You're decent enough but a Necromancer is not going to marry an Amazon. It's just not done."<p>Mousse looked at Shampoo, watching as she struggled to hold her spear steady and concentrate. The desert breeze passed through the town and caught her hair, the slight movements not breaking her thoughts. She really was beautiful at a time like this.<p>"I know," Mousse said, standing up and handing the book over to Cologne. "But you can't blame a guy for dreaming."<p>Shampoo didn't see him leave and it was only until she finally broke her stance that she noticed he was gone. Her brow furrowed as she looked at her great-grandmother.<p>"Where duck boy go?"<p>"Back to camp. Come on, we need to have a little talk about Ranma."<p>* * *<p>"Where is this guy?" Ranma said, tapping his foot impatiently. The four of them were standing outside the palace, waiting for the leader of Lut Gholein to show up. But the guards kept telling them that he was preparing to meet with them.<p>He was just about to storm through the gates when down the stairs came a very well dressed man, a sword hanging at his waist. He had a regal air to him and a very noble face that was currently mangled with several bruises and cuts.<p>Oh crap, Ranma thought. It's the same guy I met coming into to town.<p>"Greetings," the man said. "I am Takewaki Kuno, leader of Lut Gholein and your most humble host." He paused, suddenly seeing Akane. "And much humbler now that I have met such beauty." He picked up her hand and gave it a kiss.<p>Akane blushed a bit and shifted nervously at the attention. Meanwhile Ranma looked rather unhappily at the scene. He didn't trust the guy, seeing how quickly he moved from one girl to the next without batting an eyelash.<p>"Look here," Ranma said getting a bit angry.<p>"Hmmmm?" Kuno said not looking away from Akane or letting going over hand, though it appeared that she was trying to get him to release it.<p>"Ah, what the boy means," Genma said, "is that we are visiting this fine region of the world and were wondering if perhaps you could use our assistance."<p>Kuno broke away from Akane's hand and looked at the older man. "And what makes you think that I, the great Takewaki Kuno, the Blue Thunder of Lut Gholein would need help from the likes of you?"<p>A guard leaned over and whispered something in his ear. Kuno nodded after a moment and returned his attention back to the group. "Very well, there is one task you may perform. There is a pest that has been hunting in our sewers and killing some of the inhabitants of the town. Take care of it and I will reward you."<p>Ranma's nose twitched and he was about to really let the pompous guy have it. But Genma saw what was going on and quickly grabbed Ranma before he could say anything. "Thank you so much, Lord Kuno, we'll get right on it. Come on boy."<p>Akane bowed a bit at Kuno and was about to join the group when she felt his arm on her hand. Her first reaction was to wallop him but since this was his town, she forced herself to stop.<p>"Ah, my dearest, you wouldn't be joining them, would you!" Kuno said. "I wouldn't dream of allowing a woman of your beauty to risk herself in a place like the sewers of this town. Come, I will let you date with me and..."<p>"All right that's it," Ranma said, reaching them and yanking Kuno's arm away. "Let's get this straight, she's not interested."<p>"I think she would have said something," Kuno said. "Though she would not be the first to be left speechless by my charm and handsomeness."<p>"Is there anything inside your head besides hot air," Ranma said. "I said she wasn't interested."<p>"Ah, I think I can answer for myself," Akane said, a bit peeved at the whole discussion. But the two men ignored her.<p>"And how, pray tell, do you have such knowledge of her wants?"<p>"'Cause she's my fiancée!" Ranma yelled. Akane's anger simmered at bit at the sentiment.<p>"That is not possible," Kuno stated. "Why would a woman like her be mixed up with a man like you?"<p>"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" Ranma demanded.<p>"Why, you are nothing more than a mercenary. What possible life could you offer to her? Do you have money or power or anything that matters in this world? Or are you just as you appear, a penniless fighter with no home." Ranma's anger flared but he couldn't quite bring himself to answer Kuno's challenge. "It is obvious," Kuno continued, "that you have ensnarled her in a spell of some sort." He reached over and took Akane's hand. "Do not worry, my sweet, I will free you from the bonds of this treacherous sorcerer."<p>"Ah," Akane said. "I'm the Sorcerer... Sorceress."<p>"I can see it now," Kuno continued, not listening to a word she said. "Takewaki Kuno, rescuer of beautiful damsels in distress brings home the jewel of the desert to be his queen and lavishes her with gifts from across the seven seas and... Where did you all go?"<p>* * *<p>"Stupid Kuno," Ranma said as he stepped off the ladder into the sewer. "I bet he's still talking."<p>"Don't let it get you down boy," Genma said. "He doesn't know what he's talking about anyway. Right Tendo?"<p>Soun meanwhile was still trying to get past the Queen bit. His Akane, a Queen.<p>"DAD!" Akane yelled. "Hello, we're talking to you!"<p>"Oh, sorry, what were you saying?"<p>"That we should keep our voices down," Ranma said, glaring at Akane. "In case that monster is nearby."<p>Akane smiled a bit, realizing her mistake. "Ah, Ranma," she whispered.<p>"Yeah Akane?"<p>"Was it really a good idea for you to come down here?"<p>"Why's tha..." He didn't get the chance to finish. A small river of cold water suddenly hit his head from the ceiling.<p>"Damn it," Ranma-chan said. "This is all I needed."<p>"Ah... Ranma, you can still fight like that right?"<p>"Yeah, Akane. Why?"<p>A roar filled the sewer to answer her. Ranma-chan looked up and saw that Akane and Genma were already preparing spells.<p>"It's the monster!" Akane hissed, finally getting the words out.<p>"Well duh," Ranma-chan hissed back. She reached for her sword but it was too heavy to lift. Dropping it on the ground, she looked around for something else but it was too late. The creature had already rounded the corner.<p>* * *<p>"My love!" Kuno called down into the sewer. "Please answer me!"<p>"Why don't you just go down there yourself?" one of the guard asked.<p>"And risk getting myself dirty and being seen by my little dove? I would never want to put her through that trauma."<p>The guard rolled his eyes and Kuno turned to return to his calling when came face to face with an ugly, furry face with whiskers and two yellow teeth. He let out a little squeal and fell backwards.<p>"Kill it!" he cried.<p>"It's already dead," came a voice.<p>"Ah! It can talk."<p>"No you idiot..." There was a pause and the dead rat was pushed through the rest of the opening followed quickly by Ranma-chan. "Here's your damn monster. An over sized rat! We thought it couldn't be it but after three hours of searching the sewers..."<p>"Pig-tailed girl!" Glomp.<p>"THAT'S IT!" Crack. Snap. Pop.<p>"RANMA! HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET PAID IF YOU KILL OUR HOST!"<p>Ranma-chan stopped beating up on Kuno long enough to realize that his father was trying to pull him away.<p>"I'll kill him!" Ranma-chan said. "Let me go!"<p>Akane and Soun came out of the sewers last and got one look at the scene and sighed.<p>"So much for getting paid," Akane said.<p>"Indeed," Soun said. "Of course, you could just marry him and be a qu..."<p>Akane brought her fist down on top of her father's head. "Never, ever say that again."<p>* * *<p>Later that day...<p>"We're back!" Ukyo said happily as she bounded into camp. "Come on Ryoga, you're so slow!"<p>Ryoga waddled in, laden down with bag upon bag of spices, cooking utensils and produce. He tried to keep balance but eventually the fact that he couldn't see caught up with him and he hit one of the caravan's wagons full on, sending the packages sprawling on the ground.<p>"You jack ass!" Ukyo cried. Ryoga just looked relieved to be able to see again. He suddenly realized that Shampoo and Cologne were there are well. He looked at them, face full of hope but Shampoo shook her head and gave him the thumbs-down signal. He collapsed unhappily onto the ground.<p>"How could this get any worse!" he lamented at the sky.<p>Then he heard the drums. Followed by the trumpets. And suddenly a couple of girls appeared, scattering flowers on the ground.<p>"Greetings," said a man, whose face looked like he had run straight into a rock. "I the great Takewaki Kuno, Blue Thunder of Lut Gholein, have come to reward you for your services."<p>"It's about time," Ranma said emerging from one of the wagons. Akane quickly followed, with Genma and Soun in tow.<p>Kuno and Ranma glared at each other angrily. "Where is the pigtailed girl?" Kuno asked.<p>Ranma sighed. "I really don't want to get into that right now."<p>"Have you enchanted her as well? Or have you trapped her against her will? Or..."<p>"Kuno!" Akane cried. "Please, it's been a long day and we all want to get some rest."<p>Kuno turned his attention quickly away from Ranma and right to Akane. "Ah my beloved. Only can I entrust you with this most special reward. One for yourself and one for my glorious pig tailed girl."<p>With a motion of his hand, two servants brought up two rectangles covered with cloth. The servants removed the sheets and there were two paintings. Each feature Kuno, standing atop a mound of sound dressed in royal splendor holding his sword in the air. The only difference was with the girl, who clutched at his leg. Well, at least the face. Both of them were wearing next to nothing and in the exact same pose.<p>"Enjoy your reward," Kuno said with a smile. "And remember that it will take but a word and this shall become a reality."<p>Akane looked horrified. Then very angry. Then smiling. "Ranma..."<p>"Taken care," Ranma said, cracking his knuckles.
