</div> <b><i><p>Author's note:</p></i></b> This is it… the end game starts here and… sniffle… must not get emotional over impending end of story.<p>Thanks to Another Duck for the beta read again… I know, someday, I will learn to use commas… really I will.</p><p>What's a Vaught? You mean… you don't know what a Vaught is? I sure in hell didn't but it turns out the Vaught is the name of the background artist. Now go back read the part about the Halls of Vaught… tricky, eh?</p><p>Everyone is throwing such nice comments my way, so thank you very much. I do write other stuff but this… this is my baby and sniffle… it's almost over…</p><p>By the way… anything that is surrounded by tildes, ( ~ ), are actual passages from the story, like little flashbacks from what's happened before.</p><p>So yeah, enjoy the chapter and ummm… well… don't kill me.</p><b><i><p style="text-align:center;">Act 5, Quest 5 : Rite of Passage</p></i></b><p>The walls of the mountain shook and Akane lost her footing, briefly grazing the ice wall before a firm hand steadied her. Looking up, she met the eyes of Shampoo, seeing a bit of worry behind the normally cool façade. Without a word, the Amazon left her behind and continued walking up the icy slope in silence.</p><p>In fact, since they had entered the mountain, no one had said a word. The constant shaking of the mountain were testimony to what was occurring outside. A battle was raging and they were running away, up through the empty ice passages that wove their way through the massive mountain. Despite casting Warmth repeatedly, Akane couldn't get warm. She tried to push thoughts out of her mind about her family, but it was still there, a constant worry in the back of her mind.</p><p>Genma suddenly stopped and held up his hand, signaling to the group to the same. He took a few steps forward and disappeared around a corner. A few seconds later, a wave of sunlight flooded the cavern, and Genma called out to them to join him.</p><p>The group spilled out of the cave, landing on the snowy plateau. Ranma looked around and found that there was no longer any mountain visible to them, they had reached the summit.</p><p>A raven cried from above and tore through the clouds, suddenly followed by at least three dozen more. They dove down the side of the mountain and disappeared from view. Cautiously, Ranma walked to the edge and looked out at the view.</p><p>Harrogath spread out before them, the town so small from the high vantage point that it looked like a toy. Ryoga reached out a hand and for a moment, he felt like he could just take the town in his hand and pull it away.</p><p>And he wished he really could have done that. From here, they could all see what was happening. Harrogath was burning, its proud walls smashed by demon catapults. But the main assault still hadn't come. The Army of Light was holding the hordes back. The snowy battlefield was barely visible under the haze of spells and smoke.</p><p>"We need to keep moving," Genma said, watching them all stare at the scene.</p><p>They all looked at him, their faces saying all the words of worry and anger that could not be spoken. They wanted to be down with everyone else. It was worse now that they could see what was happening. Why did they have to come here? What could possibly be more important than this?</p><p>Genma walked forward towards the stone circle in the summit. In the center was an altar, plain and unadorned, yet radiating with power. Three stone statues watched him as he moved. Cautiously, Genma walked forward, waiting for something to happen. He leaned forward onto the altar and cautiously used a hand to wipe away some of the snow.</p><p>The altar lit up, a beam of light shot upwards and into the snowy sky, breaking the clouds and letting the sun reach the summit. The assembled group turned upwards, watching as the sunlight hit their armor, giving it almost a heavenly glow.</p><i><p>"We are the spirits of the Nephalem, the Ancient Ones. We have been chose to guard sacred Mount Arreat, wherein the Worldstone rests. Few are worthy to stand in its presence; fewer still can comprehend its true purpose. Before you enter, you must defeat us."</p></i><p>The group jumped back and began to look around.</p><p>"What the hell was that?" Ranma asked, drawing his sword.</p><p>"It's the legend," Ryoga replied. "Those who are guarding the summit won't let us pass until we've beaten them."</p><p>"Then we beat," Shampoo replied, nocking an arrow and aiming it around trying to locate her foe.</p><p>Suddenly the stone statue to her left moved. The sound of rock's breaking echoed through the summit. The stone skin flaked off and in place of a statue stood a man. Tall and with brown hair, wearing fur and hold himself proud and strong, it wasn't hard to guess his heritage. Barbarian and from the looks of the scars on him, a very battle tested one at that.</p><p>"Ah… that really can't be good," Ukyo said.</p><p>The Guardian brought his throwing axes up and pointed to Shampoo. The rest of the group looked at him and then back at the purple haired Amazon.</p><p>"Is this one-on-one combat?" Akane asked, watching as the man walked to the center of the ring.</p><p>"Not according to the legend," Ryoga said. "But then… it's just a legend. I don't know if…"</p><p>Shampoo locked eyes with the Guardian and nodded, slowly walking into the circle.</p><p>"Is not problem, Shampoo take down," she said letting an arrow fly.</p><i><p>The arrow sailed and hit the target right in the middle. A very young Shampoo nodded assertively as she pulled another arrow. She was about to fire when she heard someone approach and quickly shifted her aim.</p><p>A lady with flowing blue hair slowly moved towards her, armor shifting slightly as she did. She had a sad smile on her face and she watched as the young girl turn back to the target.</p><p>"It will be dark soon," she said.</p><p>"I don't care," Shampoo replied. "I want to get this right."</p><p>The woman walked towards the target and Shampoo relaxed her grip on it. Looking down the other woman smiled.</p><p>"You almost hit the target."</p><p>"But it's not perfect," Shampoo replied.</p><p>The other woman nodded. "But it's still good."</p><p>"No!" Shampoo cried. "If it's not the center, then what does it matter?"</p><p>The other woman looked over at her sadly. "Is that all you see? The center?"</p><p>The little girl paused. "What else is there?"</p><p>The woman sighed. "If all you see is the center then you are not seeing anything at all. The center is just one small part of the whole," she said running a hand around part of the outer circle.</p></i><p>Her arrow was true to its course but the Guardian was too fast. He quickly evaded and responded with a barrage of attacks on his own. She barely had the chance to dodge.</p><i><p>She's wrong, you always aim for the center. There is only one real target, only one real way.</p><p>The Amazon way is the only way you must follow, Cologne had said.</p></i><p>Shampoo paused, her footing slowly skidding to a stop as she turned around, just in time to see the Guardian's axes hit where she was.</p><i><p>There is only one way, one path, one target you must strive to hit.</p></i><p>She turned and her eyes grazed past the circle of people around them. She pulled an arrow and twisted her back, shooting it towards the approaching man. He ducked and leapt forward, the axes coming dangerously close.</p><i><p>But is it true? Was there only one path like the Amazons taught? Or…</p></i><p>He was too close and she couldn't fire. All she could do was bring her bow up and attempt to shield the attack. It whined against the weight as he pressed his axes against it and she brought a foot up, kicking him in the gut and giving herself a chance to get away.</p><p>"Shampoo!" Ukyo cried but Shampoo shook her head. No, they couldn't afford to mess things up now by breaking the rules.</p><p>She turned the bow in her hand and brought it around to nocking it once more. She watched as the Guardian walked around, preparing to attack. She shot a glance over at her small group of friends, watching them tense as her enemy prepared to attack.</p><i><p>Or had maybe my path has long since strayed from a single target?</p><p>~ "No about what you expect. About what you not expect. Road to cure full of non-expected things. You can handle? No. You weak." ~</p><p>I had said that to Ranma in the beginning but… but had I been the weakest of them all?</p></i><p>The Guardian threw and Shampoo barely managed to flip out of the way. She reached back and felt the arrows there. There were only three left.</p><i><p>~ "She is dead to her tribe," Cologne said. "That is my last gift to her. To be no longer bound by Amazon law and not have to face being ostracized by her peers for being rescued by a man." ~</p><p>I am alone.</p><p>~ "No tribe, no class. Shampoo no have even weapon to fight." ~</p></i><p>She let the first arrow fly on it went wide. The Guardian brought his head up to face her, dragging his feet in the snow to slow his charge as he steadied himself for the next throw.</p><p>"You can do it Shampoo!" Ukyo cried from the side. Shampoo stole a glance and saw the brown haired assassin jumping up and down as she cheered. Around her, the rest of the group was attempting to booster her spirits as well.</p><i><p>Or am I?</p><p>~ Ukyo looked at the glass in front of Shampoo and picked it up. She dumped it back into the jug and handed it to the Amazon. "Here," she said. "I think you're going to need it all." ~</p><p>Ukyo was there.</p><p>~ "But you've got us," Ukyo said, gripping the other girl's arm. ~</p><p>She was always there to lend support.</p><p>And Ryoga had been there to push me when I wanted to believe I was worthless. Akane hadn't trusted me at first but slowly warmed up to the idea of having me as a companion… maybe even as a friend. And Ranma… he never tried to force himself as his leader but… but he had managed to make himself my leader all the same.</p><p>And then…</p><p>~ "Why would Amazon marry dumb Necromancer like you?" ~</p><p>Then there was Mousse.</p><p>~ Leaning forward, he examined her and started to smile. "Wow, you are a babe!" ~</p><p>Mousse who had been with me through the beginning…</p><p>~ "Take care of her for me." ~</p><p>And the end.</p></i><p>Shampoo pulled the second arrow and fired but her vision was clouding over. It was tears. The stone façade of the purple haired Amazon was cracking. She had thought herself alone but now… now she could see the truth.</p><i><p>~ "Shampoo agree. Good fighters together now. We defeat all." ~</p><p>The center is just one small part of the whole. If all you see is the center then you are not seeing anything at all.</p><p>It's not just me. And my path… it was not mine alone. But everyone's. And I have to give them the chance to keep going.</p></i><p>The Guardian began to advance. She pulled the last arrow and nocked in place, lining it up with Guardian's heart. She held the bowstring taut and found herself locked in place, the slightest breeze picking up snow from the ground.</p><p>The sky split apart again and a beam of radiant light shot down and completely covered the Amazon.</p><p>"What is it?" Akane yelled at Genma.</p><p>The light faded just a bit and in the swath of light, there were suddenly two people. Shampoo and a blue haired woman in Amazon armor.</p><p>Genma shook his head. "I wouldn't have believed it if I wasn't seeing it with my own eyes." He said. "It's a Valkyrie."</p><p>The Valkyrie leaned forward and gripped Shampoo's hands in her own. The Guardian began to move quicker, realizing his danger. There was a cry and the arrow flew forward, a trail of light following it as it made its way to its target.</p><p>The arrow struck its target and then continued forward, piercing a hole right through the Guardian. There was no way to recover from that attack and the ancient fighter gave one last cry before it disappeared, turning back into a stone statue on its pedestal.</p><p>The light around Shampoo faded and as it did, it stole the light from her eyes as well. She fell down to the ground and the Valkyrie watched with sadness as she did. It leaned down for a moment before it disappeared with the last bit of light.</p><p>Ukyo was there first, shaking Shampoo and trying to wake her up.</p><p>"Why isn't she waking up?" she cried. "He never hit her!"</p><p>"This is a different type of injury," Genma said looking in the Amazon's eyes. "She used up ever bit of mana to cast those last two spells."</p><p>"But she'll be all right?" Akane asked. But Genma could only answer with silence.</p><p>Ukyo held back a sob and looked up, just in time to see the second statue coming to life. She stood up and clenched her fists, the blades cracking slightly as she did. She knew what Shampoo had done. It was exactly the same thing Ukyo had tried with the Overseer. Shampoo had finally realized that she was part of a group and had pushed herself beyond her limit to get them to the next stage.</p><p>The Defender pointed with his sword even though he didn't need to. Ukyo was already there.</p><i><p>"Who is your target, Sawae-san?"</p><p>"The Dark Mages!"</p><p>"What is your purpose in life, Nanao-san?"</p><p>"To eradicate evil!"</p><p>"And at what price do you do that? Ukyo-san?"</p><p>Ukyo looked up at her teacher, her ten-year-old face crumpled in confusion. The stone classroom was in the highest part of the Assassin's school and Ukyo had been staring out the window rather than paying attention.</p><p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p><p>"How far will you go to fulfill this pledge?"</p><p>Ukyo paused. "I will do anything to fulfill it."</p><p>"Will you forsake your family, your friends?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Will you give up on a normal life and live in the shadows?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"So what will you give up for this cause?"</p><p>"Everything."</p></i><p>Ukyo hand slashed down and the Defender barely had the chance to move out of the way. He scowled and began to spin, forcing Ukyo flat to the ground to avoid the Whirlwind attack.</p><p>That was close… too close. She needed to be careful now, avoid the attack and hit him with traps. She threw a few Sentries, watching as they held him in place for a moment and let her call for her Shadow.</p><p>The other Ukyo appeared looking at her with a sad smile and a nod. Ukyo paused, suddenly seeing the Shadow leap into battle and tear at the Defender with its bare hands. It was an ugly sight to watch as the Shadow yelled, striking with fury.</p><i><p>That's me… that's what I am. Was I right? Did I give everything up to the cause? In some ways yes. But… but in my heart…</p></i><p>Ukyo looked over at Ranma for a minute and he caught her eye, confusion dotting his face.</p><i><p>In my heart, there was always another cause.</p><p>~ "I don't understand. Why did Ranma leave?" ~</p></i><p>The Defender slashed an axe downward and the Shadow barely got out of the way. Ukyo leaped into the fray, unleashing a series of attacks. The Defender fell back, suddenly finding himself facing two highly skilled fighters.</p><i><p>In my heart, I was always looking for something else.</p><p>~ "Revenge," the Assassin said darkly. "Against him," she finished pointing at Ranma. ~</p></i><p>The two assassins flipped backwards effortlessly as the Defender let loose a Whirlwind attack. He growled as he came to stop and realized he hadn't hit either of them. Kneeling on the ground he let out a War Cry, boosting himself up for the next attack.</p><i><p>And I tried to say it was for revenge but…</p><p>~ "Ranma from Ukyo past, past she no talk about with anyone on all trip. Can not be happy past if she only live so can kill Ranma. Now Ukyo know that Ranma not bad person and feel like wasted life. So try to get back some of… lost time. Make Ranma seven again and believe he still Ukyo best friend. Make like happy child again." ~</p></i><p>The axe came down to quickly and the shadow reeled in surprise, an arc of blood shooting upward before the body evaporated into the Shadow Realm. Ukyo paused watching the Defender turn his attention back to her.</p><i><p>Shampoo was right. I was looking for another chance, a better past. I tried to follow everything I had been taught, making Ranma the source of evil, sacrificing everything but…</p><p>~ "Sacrificing yourself is not following that advice," Ryoga interrupted, smashing the lock with his axe. "It didn't help us at all, so never try it again." ~</p><p>But there were people their to stop me.</p></i><p>The Defender ran towards her and Ukyo made a decision. She wasn't going to call another Shadow. She was going to finish this fight by herself.</p><i><p>~ "Find the Saotomes. You are right. Your destiny lies with them." ~</p></i><p>She struck once with a Phoenix strike, the single orb of light circling around her.</p><i><p>You were right about that Mom, even if you were wrong about almost everything else.</p></i><p>He attacked but Ukyo dodged, hitting him with the second strike.</p><i><p>My destiny was always with them… and then with the others. But my destiny was not what the assassins thought.</p></i><p>Ukyo jumped backwards and landed on her feet. The light from the two orbs around her blinding the Defender for a moment, letting her land the third strike. She flipped backwards and putting as much distance between him as she could.</p><i><p>I'm not the reject anymore. I'm not the girl who pined after Ranma after losing him and sought revenge. I'm not the perfect assassin you wanted me to be. I'm me. And that's what I should have been trying to be all the time. Just me. And now, I'm going to finish what I started with Overseer.</p></i><p>With a cry, her eyes let forth the tears and she cast the final strike. For a moment, it was like the world paused and to the people watching her at the side what happened next wasn't visible. But around her, Ukyo felt the world shift and the portal to the shadow world open.</p><p>The Dragon came out, the proudest of all mythical creatures, and moved at her, grabbing her in his long talons and flying her towards the Defender. Ukyo prepared, watching the orbs around her speed up in preparation for the final strike.</p><p>The Dragon let her go and she landed in front of him. The Defender was halfway through a blink when the Chaos Ice Bolt hit him. There was a cry and the world around Ukyo turned very cold.</p><p>The Defender was encased in ice for a moment before he disappeared, the ice shattering and falling on the ground around Ukyo's body. A second later, he reappeared as a statue in the circle.</p><p>Akane was there first looking down at the other girl and seeing the same blank expression in her eyes.</p><p>"Not again," she said softly. The third stone statue shifted as the transformation began. "Can't you wait! Can't you give us just a second!"</p><p>But the Protector was already free and he was staring at them. Ryoga started to walk over but Akane managed to grab his hand.</p><p>"Don't… you know what's going to happen, don't you?"</p><p>Ryoga nodded. "Of course."</p><p>"Then don't go," Akane said softly.</p><p>Ryoga paused and looked back at the three remaining members. "I can't let Ukyo and Shampoo have all the fun now."</p><p>He started to turn away but locked eyes with Ranma. "Take care of her, you hear?"</p><p>Ranma nodded and put a hand on Akane's shoulder. Ryoga turned and walked away, just in time to catch sight of the Protector's huge axe pointing at him.</p><i><p>"Did you get lost again?"</p><p>Ryoga shook his head, watching as his mother's hands encircled him and picked him up. "What are we going to do with you?"</p><p>Little Ryoga started to cry because he didn't know what else to do. He didn't understand why he couldn't find his way around, why his mother always had to find him.</p><p>"Don't cry, little one. I know it's hard but… it's so easy to cry. What's really hard, is to smile, to laugh, and to find joy in all the hardship of life."</p></i><p>Ryoga scowled, watching the Protector wave a big axe at him. For a moment, they looked exactly alike, two Barbarians holding mighty axes and preparing for battle.</p><i><p>This is it. This is the last fight. I wonder what Shampoo and Ukyo thought about when they stood here. Shampoo cried. Ukyo cried. I guess I should too, being that this is probably it and all.</p></i><p>The Protector let loose a battle cry and Ryoga echoed it, gripping his axe tightly. His face said all the things he wouldn't speak. Bring it on.</p><i><p>Yeah, 'cause it was such a great life to begin with. Akane was the perfect girl, only she didn't love me unless I was a pig. My home was destroyed, my family is dead.</p></i><p>The Protector leapt up and Ryoga followed suit, both combatants meeting in the air with a clash of steel. They hit the ground on the opposite side where they had started. The Protector looked at him with anger.</p><i><p>I'm not going to give up that easy. No matter how miserable my life is.</p><p>~ "Will daddy be proud of me?" ~</p><p>~ "Oh yes, as will your mother and the rest of your tribe. And the young girl you like so much." ~</p><p>The fortuneteller was full of crap. What would any of them have been proud about? What the hell have I accomplished in life?</p></i><p>Ryoga swirled the axe in his fist and charged at the Protector, launched a series of Frenzied attacks at him. But the Protector countered, mimicking every move he made.</p><i><p>Crap! It's like fighting myself. Resilient old bastard! Why don't you just die! You've been dead for years. What the hell do you have to live for? Gods! Does everyone have more to live than me? My life is that miserable, huh?</p></i><p>The two barbarians clashed in the middle and their axes locked together. It was no longer a matter fancy skills, it was about who was stronger. Ryoga's feet started to slip in the snow and back towards the edge of the summit. The Protector scowled.</p><i><p>You think I'm scared? Scared of what? To die? Most of the people I know are already there. Anything after this would be better than what I've had to endure in this life.</p><p>~ Ryoga laughed. "We'd just step on them. Squash."<p>Ranma looked over as Ryoga devoured his food. "Some of us could have squashed those big monsters too."<p>There were assorted chuckles until Ryoga looked up and realized what was going on. "HEY!" he yelled. But he wasn't serious. In fact, he was glad to hear them all laughing again. ~</p></p></p></i><p>His feet found no traction in the snow and Ryoga was losing ground fast. His muscles strained against the pressure.</p><i><p>Okay, so there had been a few laughs… though it was usually at my expense. So that didn't count right?</p><p>~ "I did it!" Ryoga screamed. "I finally BEAT RANMA!"<p>"NO WAY!" Ranma said, trying to drown him out. "We're doing best two out of three!" But Ryoga was already gloating and walking around the room, singing Barbarian victory songs. ~</p></p></i><p>Something started to creak and Ryoga realized it was his axe. It was starting to come apart against the strength of the Protector. Not that it mattered. The edge of the cliff was coming up fast and he'd be tossed over it before his weapon was destroyed.</p><i><p>Fine! There were good times. But… but everything else was wrong, everything in my life is miserable.</p><p>~ "Come on Ryoga… join the love."</p><p>"Shut up, Ranma," Ryoga said before Akane grabbed his arm and pulled him to the group.</p><p>"We're together again," she said with a smile. "We're back as a group." ~</p></i><p>Ryoga looked over at his shoulder. He could see Genma, Ranma and Akane looking at him with worry. He looked back at his enemy and saw the anger reflected in his eyes. Suddenly Ryoga's grip started to loosen on his axe.</p><i><p>Crap. It wasn't that bad of a life, was it? I guess it was just easier to go down thinking it was. More like, it was easier to just live thinking it was. If things were always bad, then it wouldn't be so bad having the deal with whatever got thrown my way.</p><p>I think you were right mom. It was easier to just let life suck. Only looking back… maybe it wasn't that bad. Maybe I did accomplish something.</p></i><p>Ryoga looked at the Protector and started to laugh. The Protector balked a bit and watched as the barbarian let loose a string of happy laughter.</p><i><p>Just my luck, right? To figure out that life was okay right when it's about it end. It's always like that. But… but I glad I got to realize it… even if its over.</p></i><p>Ryoga's axe shattered and the Protector's weapon landed right in his chest. For a moment, the Protector thought he had won but Ryoga's hand grabbed his wrists tightly. The boy fell backwards, hitting the ground hard and sending the Protector up over his head and over the edge of the cliff.</p><p>There was silence and suddenly the third statue reappeared in its place.</p><p>Ranma made it there first this time, looking down at the Barbarian's chest, expecting to see the Protector's axe embedded in his chest. But there was no weapon, only Ryoga who looked up at the sky with clouded over eyes with a large smile on his face.</p><p>Ryoga, Ukyo and Shampoo lay propped up in the middle of the circle, each of the back touching the other two. They faced the statue of the warrior they had bested, their weapons lay at their feet. Their eyes had been closed and on their lap were branches from the nearby pines.</p><p>A snow began to fall, slowly dusting them, making them take on the appearance of the statues that they had beaten before making the final sacrifice. It would have been the saddest memorial to have ever graced the world but none of the three warriors looked in pain.</p><p>Shampoo's face was at peace. Ukyo's face was relaxed with relief. Ryoga was still smiling. And their hands had been laced together forming an unbreakable circle.</p><p>Akane wiped the last tear from eye and turned to Ranma and Genma. They looked at her with silent nods as they waited for her to catch up.</p><p>Just as the journey had begun, it was about to end. The three remaining warriors walked through the summit entrance and prepared to face the final unknown, the knowledge of how many people had sacrificed themselves to get to this point still fresh on their minds. But rather than weigh on their hearts, they all felt empowered, stronger than ever and ready to defeat whatever awaited them.</p>
