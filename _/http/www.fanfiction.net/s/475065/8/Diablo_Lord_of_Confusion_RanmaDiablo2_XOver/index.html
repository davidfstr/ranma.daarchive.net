</div>Author's Note:<p>Thank you to everyone who has been reviewing and e-mailing. I haven't had the chance to reply to most of you personally yet (new job and all), but I do appreciate it.<p>Interlude One - Crossing to the East<p>Mousse squinted his eyes at the sun, struggling to keep the beast beneath him steady. The situation had gotten progressively worse since they left the Rouge encampment and from the never ending sea of sand ahead of him, it didn't appear to be getting better any time soon.<p>Mousse shifted uncomfortably in his robes, aware of the beating heat on his back but unwilling to remove them. He shot over a glance to Ryoga who looked far more uncomfortable then him. The Barbarian's home was the exact opposite of this extreme and despite his attempts, it was apparent that he couldn't wait to arrive at their destination.<p>To Mousse's right, Shampoo rode silently, her spear attached to the side of her camel. The purple-hair amazon had pulled her hair up as much as possible but the result was a deepening red on her back and neck as the sun burned the skin. If she was in pain, she didn't show it but concentrated on staring onto the distance.<p>In lead of the caravan, Genma and Ranma rode on, neither acknowledging the rest of the group or each other. As Shampoo predicted, Cologne had been able to reverse the effects of the poison that had afflicted Ranma. He was still a bit stiff from it and they couldn't spare with each other that much because of the heat. Still at night, Mousse could hear them fighting off in the distance though where it was over trying to regain his strength or vent his frustrations out, Mousse didn't know. He just knew that Ranma hadn't said much of anything since the last battle.<p>"Mousse," Shampoo said suddenly.<p>"Yes?"<p>"Time to change with Ukyo," Shampoo replied and then fell silent again.<p>Mousse pulled the reigns of his beast, trying to force the camel back towards one of the covered wagons. He managed to get there after a few minute of struggle. He jumped off the camel and led it in his hand while he tapped on the canvas of the wagon.<p>Ukyo poked her head out, the younger girl looking relieved to see him. Ukyo had probably taken what had happened the hardest, though Mousse didn't know why. None of them understood but Ukyo seemed to be doing her best to avoid guard duty.<p>Ukyo jumped out of the caravan and took the camel. "She hasn't said a word yet," Ukyo said. Mousse nodded and watched as Ukyo jumped onto the camel. "I'm going to go check on Ranma."<p>"Ukyo," Mousse said. "I think we need to talk. Tonight."<p>Ukyo paused, as if she wanted to argue but her desire to get away finally won and she gave a quick nod and took off. Mousse matched his pace to the wagon and managed to grab the side and swing himself inside.<p>Akane was in the corner, wrapped in a blanket and blindfolded. Her hand was bound in front of her and her mouth was slowly moving as she mouthed words that no one could interpret. Mousse carefully sat down next to her and touched her shoulder.<p>Akane jumped slightly and started to tremble. Mousse carefully lifted the blindfold to see if anything had changed. The blackness of her eyes was still there but it swirled now, an occasional color whipping through the darkness. He stared at them, looking for something that might explain the girl's near catatonic state.<p>And then he saw it, a pattern in the darkness.<p>* * *<p>"You know what happened," Mousse said as he sat down next to Ukyo.<p>They had found an oasis and decided to stop for the day to enjoy the small miracle. Ryoga and Shampoo looked miserably at the cool waters that were in the center of the oasis, knowing that neither could enjoy it without activating their curses. The rest of the group had sought out shade, enjoying the cool water. Ranma had separated from Genma and taken a position guarding Akane.<p>Ukyo shook her head. "I don't know exactly because I'm not high enough level yet. But I've heard stories."<p>"I saw you in her eyes," Mousse said. "Or at least a pattern of you."<p>Ukyo nodded slowly. "It's a Shadow," she said softly. "It's a higher level spell and only the highest level assassins understand it completely. But they believe that everyone has a Shadow and that it resides in a different plane. When they summon their Shadow, she can fight like them, act like them but she's not..."<p>"Real," Mousse finished. "So when we saw the Black Rose disappear into the shadows, it was Akane who pulled her. But was is it Akane or her Shadow?"<p>Ukyo shook her head. "I don't know. I've never heard of a spell like that. If it does exist, I don't think it's stored anywhere but in a Master assassin's mind! I didn't teach her it, I promise!"<p>"I know you didn't," Mouse said quickly. "Why would you think that?"<p>"I'm the only one who would know something like that and well... if Ranma thought that I taught Akane something like that..."<p>"I don't think he would think that," Mousse said.<p>"But he hasn't said a word to anyone," she said glumly.<p>"I think he's just confused," Mousse said. "Give him time."<p>Ukyo nodded. "Thanks Mousse," she said. "You know, when you're not following around that purple-haired bimbo like a lap dog, you're an okay..."<p>"What you just call Shampoo?"<p>Mousse and Ukyo turned just in time to see Shampoo striding towards them. Mousse was about to try to placate them when Ukyo beat him to it, sort of.<p>"You heard me," Ukyo retorted. "If you had a brain cell in your head, you'd stop chasing after Ranma and go for Mousse!"<p>"Dumb assassin want Mousse, can have him!"<p>"Fine," Ukyo said wrapped a hand around Mousse's arm.<p>"Ah, now just a minute," Mousse began.<p>"Get hand off Mousse!" Shampoo cried, grabbing the other arm.<p>"Ah... I don't think this is such a good idea," Mousse ventured.<p>"Well, you're all hot and bothered now... so maybe you do want him," Ukyo said with an evil grin, knowing she was egging the Amazon.<p>"Not true. Just no want him to get in trouble with Assassin."<p>"Trouble?" Ukyo said innocently. "What kind of trouble?"<p>"When Assassin poison wrong person, that trouble," Shampoo said, pulling Mousse her way.<p>"I wouldn't do that!" Ukyo said, pulling him back.<p>"Ukyo do that to Ranma and Ranma father!" Shampoo retorted give a good yank.<p>"Now, girls, please just ...oof."<p>"That wasn't my fault! They STOLE MY CART!"<p>"Sure they do. Shampoo think is excuse!"<p>"Oww! Don't pull so hard!"<p>"It's not an excuse!"<p>"Hey girls," Mousse said slyly. "You know, there's more than enough of me for both of you."<p>Shampoo and Ukyo stopped fighting and looked at Mousse. Their faces suddenly shifted from anger to disgust. Without a word to each other, they pushed Mousse away and right into the water. Suddenly Mousse disappeared and a duck replaced him.<p>"He's getting feathers in the water!" Ryoga called out.<p>* * *<p>Ranma sat silently next to Akane, deep in meditation. The only change that was visible was the gradual shift of his aura's color. Every so often they would envelope Akane but nothing changed in her condition.<p>Genma came over and sat next to him, watching his boy work. Genma knew that it was the wrong approach but he couldn't reach his son. It would only be a few moments longer before...<p>Ranma's aura flickered and fell. He opened his eyes and let out a disappointed sigh. He was about to get another mana potion but saw his father in front of him. "Don't say it," Ranma said, before the older man could speak.<p>"It won't work," Genma said anyway. "You know that. It's not a curse, it's not poison."<p>"Well, I have to do something," he said softly. "It's my fault she's like this. If I was more careful... she wouldn't have had to use that spell." Genma fell silent. "And no one knows what's wrong. Cologne can't cure it. You can fix it. And all of my auras are useless. There must be a higher level one that could..."<p>"Ranma," Genma said, sounding fatherly. "This is not something you can cure. Mousse already said it, this isn't a curse. Cologne said it isn't a poison..."<p>"I think its shock." Genma and Ranma looked up at Ukyo as she joined the group. "Mousse and I were talking about it and I'm sure he'd tell you the same... if he wasn't a duck again."<p>"Shock from what?" Genma asked. Ukyo sighed and began to relate the same story she had told Mousse.<p>"But I didn't teach her it," Ukyo emphasized. "I wouldn't..."<p>"Can you help her?" Ranma said. Ukyo didn't know how to reply. "Please, Ukyo if you can help her or tell me how to help her..."<p>Ukyo was torn. Here was the man she wanted to marry asking her to save his other fiancée. But then, Akane wasn't the problem. She was a good girl and seemed pretty nice. Under different circumstances maybe they could have even been friends. And if she didn't try to help, it wouldn't help her situation with Ranma.<p>But she was afraid too. She had had some training in this but... she was still too low level to risk a full summon but maybe...<p>Ukyo sat down on the floor and grabbed Akane's hands. She concentrated on what she had been taught and emptied her mind of everything. She fed all of her problems into a void, let them swirl away and disappear. A moment longer she started to follow.<p>She stayed far away though she could feel the pull and started to call out. Her voice didn't travel into the void. She concentrated, trying to feed a thought much as she had done when clearing her mind.<p>There was movement and Ukyo felt something in her mind shift. Her attachment with the real world became fainter and Ukyo could feel herself sliding away. This was what her teachers had warned her about, don't let yourself get sucked into this void. You may believe it is only in your mind but it is real and it will take you to a place of nightmares.<p>Ukyo started to pull away, torn with her desire to be safe again and to help Akane find her way. But in the end, Ukyo knew she wasn't strong enough. She was about to break her concentration when she felt some call out to her. It was a small sound at first but as Ukyo concentrated on it, she started to hear it clearer.<p>It took her a few more seconds to realize that the noise was actually coming from outside her mind and that her hand was really starting to hurt. A second later she realized both things were coming from Akane.<p>"Ukyo!" Ranma said, trying to yell over Akane screams. "Ukyo, stop!"<p>"I can't!" Ukyo said trying to pull away but her hand was being crushed in Akane's grip.<p>"Akane!" Ranma cried. "Let her go!" But Akane didn't respond.<p>"She's breaking my hand!" Ukyo cried, getting desperate.<p>Suddenly Akane stopped and slumped forward. As she did, Shampoo suddenly appeared from behind her, holding a broken jug. Ranma jumped up and hit the remained jug from her hand.<p>"Are you crazy?" Ranma said. "What the hell possessed you to do that?"<p>"Girl hysterical," Shampoo said calmly. "Going to break Ukyo hand."<p>"She's right," Cologne said, examining Ukyo's hand. "It's fractured. What happened?"<p>Ukyo shook her head. "I don't know. I was just thinking and hoping someone would hear me and help..."<p>"Ow..."<p>The group stopped arguing and looked over to the source of the voice. Akane was slowly sitting up. "What's going on?"<p>But most of her sentence was lost as a rush of people enveloped her in a hug.<p>* * *<p>"So you really don't remember anything?" Soun asked, his eyes still moist.<p>Akane shook her head. "I just remember the fight and then I guess I passed out because the next thing I know, Ukyo's got my shoulder and she's pulling me somewhere. Then I'm out again and when I wake up, I'm here."<p>Genma nodded. "It sounds like you forgot most of what happened."<p>"Yes, you were out for almost half of our trip," Ryoga said. "We were all really worried."<p>Akane smiled. "I'm fine, I'm just very tired. And very sorry Ukyo," she said softly. "I didn't know what I was doing."<p>"It's okay," Ukyo said, nursing her wrist. "A few more healing potions and I'll be fine."<p>Akane nodded and stood up. "I think I'm just going to go to sleep."<p>"I'll walk with you," Ranma said jumping to his feet. As soon as the two were out of earshot, the group returned to their discussion.<p>"It wasn't me," Ukyo said first. "I never pulled her out."<p>"It was your Shadow," Mousse replied. "It sounds like Akane was partial stuck in the other plane. And your Shadow pulled her the rest of the way out."<p>"Did you get the chance to talk to her at all?" Genma asked. "Your Shadow that is..."<p>"I don't think it works that way." Ukyo said. "At least... I don't know. Maybe I'll be able to find someone who knows this type of things when we reach town."<p>"That's fine," Genma said. "I think Akane was right, we should go to sleep." Genma stood up and helped Soun as well, who had burst into tears over the mention of his daughter's name. Ukyo tried to stand up by herself but Ryoga beat her to it and carefully helped her stand. He blushed a bit when she smiled and started to lead him away.<p>Cologne, Mousse and Shampoo were the only ones remaining at the campfire. Shampoo shook her head and went to pick up her spear.<p>"Sorceress lie again," she said, retrieving the weapon. "Shampoo can tell." Mousse nodded in agreement.<p>"Time will tell," Cologne said. "But I think there is much more to this story then is being told. Most of all... where did she learn that spell?"<p>* * *<p>Akane shuffled her feet as she walked towards the tents. She didn't say anything as she concentrated on her feet taking each step. Ranma walked next to her, arms folded behind his head. He didn't know what to say but he knew something was wrong.<p>Give him a monster, give him a hell beast, give him Kodachi for Gods sake! At least he knew how to deal with that. But trying to figure out this girl was impossible!<p>"I lied," Akane suddenly said.<p>"What?" Ranma said, stopping short in surprise.<p>"I lied," Akane repeated. "I knew what was going on. I was awake the entire time. You can't imagine what it was like." Her eyes started to glistened over. "It was like here only different, warped, dark. And I saw myself there and you and everyone else only they were..." she paused. "And then Ukyo was there, only I knew it wasn't the real Ukyo. She helped me up and took me away."<p>She looked at the entrance to her tent. "He was right. Mousse was right. They never told me the price."<p>"Akane," Ranma started.<p>"Don't tell my father, I'll tell him myself. And don't tell anyone else. I don't want them to know. And if you meet a man on a road and he promises you power, walk away." And before he could say another word, she walked into her tent and disappeared.<p>* * *<p>Morning broke over the camp. Ukyo struggled out of bed, her arm still sore. She made her way out of her tent and greeted the morning sun with a groan.<p>"You're the last one up," Cologne said she hopped over to where Ukyo was standing. "Here, the potions were finished last night. Take them and you will be back to normal." Ukyo nodded. "And maybe you can make some breakfast?"<p>Ukyo smiled and stood up enthusiastically. "That's a good idea," she said grabbing the potions and running towards the smoldering fire.<p>As Ukyo passed through the camp, she realized that Cologne was right. Shampoo was chasing around Muu-muu the duck, yelling something that sounded very nasty but very foreign. Ryoga, Genma and Ranma were sparing off in the sand, enjoying the last bit of cold before the temperatures rose once more. And Akane was sitting with her father talking quietly. From the looks of it, Soun was ready to burst out in tears. Only he didn't.<p>After a few moments, they both stood up and walked over to where the other men were training. Ukyo slowed down and concentrated on what was being said, wondering what could be so important.<p>"Anything wrong?" Genma asked as he saw Soun approaching with his daughter silently in tow.<p>"No no," Soun said with a smile. "We were just coming to join you."<p>Silence.<p>"Ah..." Genma said. "Are you sure? I mean, Akane are you really up to?"<p>Akane glanced at Ranma for a moment and then looked at Genma intently. "Yes, Mr. Saotome. I want to learn how to fight. I want to learn the right way."<p>* * *<p>Hidden behind a dune, Herb frowned as he pulled the cloak over his head and placed the spyglass down. It wasn't going like he planned but the seeds had been sown. They were weak and he knew how to get to them. Even if the Sorceress did try to change her ways, the corruption was there. And soon it would be in all of them.<p>Herb slid down the dune and to his waiting horse. He jumped on and turned the horse away, galloping off around the dune until he was sure that they wouldn't see him. Then he took to the hills, leading his horse up and down them at a speed that no normal beast should have been able to maintain.<p>By the time the sun was a third of the way in the sky, Herb had reached his destination. Or at least the beginning of it. The army column stretched back to the horizon, a grizzly force of monsters that did not appreciate the weather and would occasionally take it out on a neighbor. Had anyone else been the general, the army would never have made it this far. But the fearsome figure in the front had more than enough power to keep them in check.<p>Herb jumped off his horse and bowed right away. "The girl managed to overcome the side effects of the spell but it will take her a long time to cleanse herself of it. The rest are weak, they will follow in her path soon enough."<p>"Excellent," hissed the cloak monster. "We must have them out of the picture as soon as possible. They may be the only things which could prevent my freeing my trapped brethren. Take your most trusted men and scout ahead at their destination. We will be waiting for them when they arrive."
