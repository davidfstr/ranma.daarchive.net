</div>"Tristram has been attacked! Tristram has been attacked!" Which was followed by a more morbid proclamation. "Tristram is falling! Gods help us all, Tristram is falling!"<p>Akane ran towards the soldier and grabbed him by the leg. "It's a lie!" she yelled as she trying to pull him off the horse. "You're lying!"<p>"Tendo… you're Tendo's daughter," the soldier said. "Help me," he pleaded.  "Help me convince them to help us."<p>Hinako walked over towards the duo, several angry rogues following her. "What is the meaning of this?" she demanded.<p>"Tristram is under attack," the guard repeated. "Please, lady rogue, we need your help. I have traveled for several days without rest to reach your land to beg for the assistance of the rogue army."<p>Hinako sighed. "This is all that remains of the rogue army," she said, motioning to the two dozen women in the camp.<p>The soldier's eyes widened. "It's a lie. The rogue army…"<p>"Has been decimated," Hinako interrupted. "We lost against a foe we could not see but one that destroyed us from within. I am sorry but we cannot help you now."<p>The soldier gripped on the reigns and turned around the camp. "Liars!" he screamed. "You wish to deceive me just as Tristram was deceived." He turned back towards them. "I'll go north. The Barbarians will help us!" With that, he turned his horse from them and burst through the camp's gates again.<p>"Wait!" Hinako cried but the man was already out of earshot. She turned back to the group with a sad sigh. "His horse is half dead and the snows have fallen to the north. He'll freeze to death within days."<p>"Should we go after him?" Ryoga asked.<p>"No," Ranma said firmly. "We'll go to Tristram ourselves."<p>"You crazy!" Shampoo replied. "Tristram weeks from here. It be dust under demon feet by time get there. Town doomed, we move east."<p>"How can you be so damn insensitive!" Ryoga yelled.<p>"Not insensitive," Shampoo said sharply. "Think in real world."<p>"Shampoo," Ranma said harshly, "Akane's family is in Tristram."<p>The Amazon yielded for a moment to look over to where the sorceress was. Akane sat on the ground, staring in the direction that the soldier had taken off in. Her face had paled considerably and her eyes stared out, looking at nothing.<p>"Shampoo sorry," Shampoo said softly. "But Ranma know we not get to Tristram in time."<p>"Well, unless…" Mousse started. Everyone turned to him. "There might be a way." He paused and shuffled through his cloak before finding a scroll. "I read that there are a series of stones that when hit in the correct order can transport you anyplace you wish instantaneously."<p>"And what," Ranma said, giving the Necromancer a critical eye, "we just sell our soul to some demon or sacrifice…"<p>"Paladin rhetoric is getting very tiresome," Mousse said. "Besides, this is not one of our spells. While I was exploring the crypts beneath the Sister's Burial Ground as I waited for my darling Shampoo, I came across a stone upon which was carved the legend of…"<p>"The scroll of Inifuss," Cologne finished as she hopped over to the group. "Well, Mousse, I see you've found us again." Mousse looked her unhappily. "What Mousse was trying to say is that there is a scroll which tells of the stones."<p>"Where is it?" Ranma said, grabbing his stuff.<p>"A few days' march from here," Cologne said watching with interest.<p>"I'll be back in two days," he said standing up.<p>"You go alone?" Shampoo asked surprised.<p>"It will be faster that way."<p>"But you not know where scroll is."<p>"I'll find it. Cologne just… draw me a map or something."<p>Cologne shook her head. "I don't know the exact location of it, it's just a legend. I'm sure that there are several landmarks that might help…"<p>"I could find it," Mousse said. "I've read lot about this area and I have a good idea of where it would be."<p>"Then tell me," Ranma said.<p>"Like Cologne said, this is not something that I could draw." He paused for a moment and stood up. "I'll go with you."<p>"No way. Mousse only get in trouble if try help," Shampoo said. "I go too."<p>"This isn't a party," Ranma yelled. "I'm not inviting you to join me and I don't need your help," he finished turning to Mousse.<p>"But you do boy," Genma said. If Ranma hadn't known him better, he would have suspected that Genma had been crying recently. "Let the Necromancer help you."<p>"But pop!" Ranma cried.<p>"Just do it," was his father's reply. "For my sake… and your fiancée's."<p>The group fell silent. None of them had realized the relationship between Ranma and Akane until now. In fact, considering how the acted towards one and another, it didn't really seem that they were anything more than acquaintances.<p>"Go on," Ryoga said. "Shampoo and I will watch over the camp and make sure everyone is safe." Ranma paused a moment longer before grabbing the remainder of his things and storming away from the campfire. Mousse barely had time to gather his things to follow him.<p>As soon as they were gone Ryoga and Shampoo turned to where Akane was still sitting. She hadn't moved yet, her eyes still wide in shock. Ryoga was about to walk over there but Shampoo flung out a hand to stop him.<p>"Boy go get hot water, no talk to girl, not know what to say." Ryoga looked a bit indignant at the remark but let it go. Shampoo walked over to where Akane was sitting. Slowly she sat down next to the other girl and looked out to where Ranma and Mousse had just gone, unsure of what to say. After a moment thought, she placed her arm on Akane's shoulder.<p>* * *<p>"Would you wait just a second!" Mousse cried out. But Ranma kept pushing forward. By Mousse's count they had been walking for close to fourteen hours. The sun was already starting to set and in a few hours it would be unsafe for them to walk.<p>But Ranma wasn't listening. He was so intent on the road that he didn't bother to listen to his traveling companion except of the occasional direction or instruction. Amazing, no one monsters had attacked them, probably owed to the fact that Ranma's ki was glowing such a fierce red that none dare come close. Ranma turned to ask Mousse from the next direction and was surprised to find his companion was no longer next to him.<p>He looked around furiously for the lost Necromancer and finally saw some smoke in the distance. He walked towards the source and found Mousse sitting calm by a roasting fire, warming up some water.<p>"What are you doing?" Ranma demanded as soon as he got there.<p>"I am preparing camp for the night."<p>"There's still several hours before night fall."<p>"It's more like several minutes. Besides, the mountain walls are visible now and traversing the passages underneath them is not advisable during the night." Mousse pulled out some pouches from his pack. He poured the contents into two cups and added the hot water. He offered it to Ranma but the other man snickered.<p>"Like I was trust that from you," Ranma said.<p>Mousse sighed. "I thought that I was the one that was supposed to be angry and mean. I thought Paladins reflected the aura's of goodness and virtue."<p>"What are you implying?" Ranma demanded. Mousse gestured to the red aura that surrounding him. Ranma took a look at it and sighed. He sat down next to the fire. "It's just a simple attack aura."<p>"Aura's reflect a Paladin's mood. Yours has been red since the moment I met you."<p>"I've just had a rough couple of months," Ranma replied.<p>Mousse took in a deep breath of the brew. "Really? I think that being cursed to turn into a duck was pretty bad."<p>"Trying being cursed to turn into the girl."<p>Mousse raised an eyebrow. "I don't know there could be certain advantages.  You could probably buy things a lot cheaper."<p>"It does work well actually," Ranma said. Mousse nodded and took in a deep drink.<p>"Is that still enough to be that angry?" Mousse asked. Ranma didn't say a word. "Your fiancée seems pretty enough." Ranma shrugged. "You do love her don't you?"<p>"It's an arranged thing," Ranma replied. "Our parents decided. I barely know her. I shouldn't have been surprised, what with the way pop always makes my decisions for me."<p>"So this is about your father?"<p>"No! I mean… look, just a rough couple of months okay."<p>Mousse shrugged. He placed the second cup of tea down next to Ranma. "This will help to calm you down." Ranma just looked at it. "I know Paladins and Necromancers don't trust each other but I really have no reason to hurt you." Ranma didn't move. Mousse sighed. "I drank it and I'm not growing any extra bones or demon wings. Unless you're afraid to try…"<p>"I ain't afraid!" Ranma said snatching the cup and drinking most of the contents. "Besides, last time I heard you were the only one who's a coward."<p>Mousse smiled. "I'll tell you a secret, if you promise on your honor not to tell anyone else." Ranma took in another sip of the tea, not willing to admit it was good, and nodded sternly. "I'm a level 32 Necromancer."<p>Ranma choked on his drink. "What? But you were casting pansy ass skeleton spells! And what about Shampoo, she said you couldn't protect yourself!"<p>Mousse sighed. "When a beautiful woman like Shampoo offers to travel with you, believe me you make a few sacrifices."<p>"Not me," Ranma said. "I'd never make believe I was weaker than I was, especially for a girl."<p>"We'll see," Mousse said softly. "I was serious about not telling anyone, especially Shampoo," he finished, not really masking the fear in his voice.<p>Ranma snickered and yawned, the tea already taking effect. A few minutes later he pulled out a blanket and went to sleep.<p>* * *<p>"Shaman!" Ranma cried out, slashing down another one of the fallen. He looked over a Mousse, who had a small army of skeletons protecting him in addition to a Bone Armor. Mousse looked over trying to identify the Shaman. He directed his skeletons towards the target.<p>"Hey!" Ranma called out. "That's not the SHAMAN!"<p>Mousse paused and tried again.<p>"He's… to… the… left!" Ranma cried out slashing four Fallen only to have them rise up again. Mousse corrected their movements. "Oh for the love of…" Ranma kicked a fallen hard and walked over to the Shaman and slashed him down. He healed himself as Mousse's skeleton made mince-meat of the remaining fallen.<p>"What is your problem man?" Ranma asked. "I thought you were a level 32 Necromancer but you have no control over your skeletons!"<p>"It's not like that!" Mousse cried.<p>"Than what!" Ranma demanded. Mousse whispered quietly under his breathe. "What?"<p>"I can't see!" Mousse replied.<p>"You can't…" Ranma walked over and waved his hand in front of Mousse's eyes but the other man just caught it.<p>"I can see some things… just not clearly. It's been that way since I was young."<p>Ranma sighed. "That's why you can't find your way home. You can't see where it is. And that explains why you needed Shampoo to help you."<p>Mousse slumped his shoulders. "I can read the scrolls if I hold them close, memorize the spells. I have no problem casting them with help. One day I got on the coach to school and… I ended up in the land of the Amazons."<p>Ranma snickered and then started to laugh. "Oh man, so all that 'doing it for love' stuff was a bunch of crap!"<p>Mousse shook his head. "I am completely devoted to Shampoo but I don't want her to think of me as helpless."<p>"I think she already thinks you're helpless…" Ranma paused. "Hey, does this mean you really don't know if we're going the right way?"<p>Mousse shook his head. "If you've been following my directions then I know we're going to right way. If I'm right, there should be an exit around the next bend."<p>Ranma took off and sure enough, he saw daylight filtering through an exit. Excitedly he headed up, making sure Mousse was right behind him. He spent a few minutes soaking in the sunlight before he took in his surroundings.<p>"MOUSSE! THIS IS WHERE WE JUST CAME FROM!"<p>Mousse looked around. "I admit it does look the same but it smells different. Let's walk about to the east and see what we find."<p>Trying to contain his anger, Ranma hurriedly move in the direction Mousse had said. He started mumbling angrily to himself before he heard a huge thud behind him. Looking back, he found Mousse embracing a tree rather firmly.<p>"This is it," Mousse said, moving his hands around the ancient tree's trunk  After a few minutes searching, he found a crack in the bark and reached his hand into it, withdrawing a rather ragged looking scroll. He held it up close to his face. "The Scroll of Inifuss… amazing."<p>"Yeah, really pretty and all," Ranma said absent mindedly. "Let's just get it back to the Encampment." He sighed. "Going to be a long trek though and it's already taken longer than I thought."<p>"Lucky for you, some of us are not as magically challenged." Mousse reached inside his robe and produced another scroll. He unraveled it and spoke the words on it without actually reading them. A second later a blue portal opened. "Town portal," he said. "It'll stay open until we return here." He stepped through and disappeared. A second later, Ranma followed.<p>* * *<p>Ranma took another bite of meat while he waited for Mousse and Cologne to decipher the scroll. He rested his feet on his pack, letting the fire warm them up. The day was only half over but it was already getting cold. He looked over to where Ryoga was an marveled at how it didn't seem to phase him at all. Probably all those winters in Harrogath, numbed his feeling right along with his brain.<p>"What do you want?" Ryoga demanded, as if he could Ranma's thoughts.<p>"Nothing man," Ranma said, shifting a bit. "Just enjoying the fire."<p>"Bah," Ryoga said standing up and walking away. "It's to damn hot for me. I'm going to go check in on Akane."<p>Ranma stood up. "I'll do it, I haven't seen her since I got back anyway."<p>"It's okay," Ryoga said quickly. "She's probably just sleeping. I don't mind going."<p>Ranma paused and looked at the Barbarian. He studied his face, seeing something in his eye. "I don't think you do," Ranma said.<p>"It's not what you think," Ryoga said quickly.<p>"Well, I think you're after my fiancée," Ranma retorted.<p>"It almost sounds like you care," Ryoga replied.<p>"What?" Ranma cried. "About that uncute, tomboy who hits me every time I say something wrong?"<p>"Then you don't mind," Ryoga said, turning to go. Ranma was about to chase after him when he heard his name being called out. He looked over and saw Cologne and Mousse heading towards him.<p>"What's up?" he asked, trying to hide the irritation.<p>"We've deciphered the scroll," Cologne replied. "Now when you arrive at the Field of Stones, you will be able to open the portal to where ever you wish."<p>"I think I've figured out how to get it to Tristram," Mousse said. "So I'll come with you."<p>"Shampoo come too," the Amazon said as she landed near them.<p>"Me too," Genma said joining the group.<p>"I'm going with you," a feminine voice said. Turning around, the group saw Akane standing with Ryoga, he hand clutched tightly on her wand. "I need to go."<p>Any protest he had died on Ranma's lips when he saw the look in her eye. There was no argument. Ranma nodded and walked towards the portal, his small army behind him. His aura flashed red again and quickly moved around the others. It became so intense that it almost out shone the blue portal light as he stepped through.<p>* * *<p>"Fifty," Shampoo said as she landed softly on the ground, holding her spear tightly. "Four shaman too."<p>Ranma sighed. It had taken them long enough to try to find the stones that the scroll spoke of. "Great, more Fallen to deal with."<p>"Not Fallen," Shampoo said. "Blue Fallen."<p>"Blue?" Ryoga asked.<p>"She means Carvers," Ranma said. "The Fallen's big bad cousins. Same game plan. Ryoga, hack and slash. Shampoo, you and Akane take out the Shaman first. Dad, do some damage with elementals from here. Mousse you're with me. I'll cut you a path to the stones." Mousse nodded, grateful that Ranma had realized he needed a lead there and not giving up his secret.<p>Seconds later, their weapons shining Fire red, their aura's blazing crimson, their strength risen, the group descended into the group of monsters with yells. Genma stayed behind and watched the children leap into the fray.<p>If he had been an artist man, he might have described their movements as a dance of colors as red steel met with blue skin. If he had been a poet, he would have found ways to describe how their movements were swift as the lion's, deadly as the wolf's, and terrifying as the bear's.<p>But Genma was a simple man so he could only think of one thing. Man these kids can kick some ass. So much so that he had barely fired off a couple of hurricane spells when the battle was suddenly over.<p>Mousse was reading the scroll while Ranma pushed the stones in the correct order. A beautiful music filled the air as light erupted from the circle. Briefly, Genma thought he saw a pattern in the light but by the time he made it to rejoin the group it was gone and in its place was a blazing red portal.<p>"Thought portal blue," Shampoo said, eyeing it wearily.<p>"This one," Mousse said walking around it, "is a bit different." He paused and leaned forward. "I think I can smell something burning."<p>"Let's not just stand around then," Akane said fiercely. "Let's go."<p>"We need a plan first," Ranma replied. "We need to divide into…"<p>"Screw your plan," Akane cut in, stepping into the portal.<p>"Akane!" Ranma cried but it was too late. Muttering a curse, he stepped through, following hotly on the trial on his fiancée.<p>Mousse was right, Ranma smelt the burning before he had stepped completely through the portal. His foot hit the ground and almost sank to his ankle. After a minute of adjusting to the new scenery, he realized that he wasn't stepping on dirt but rather black ash. He felt pushed from behind and turned around to see the rest of the group coming through.<p>"Where did she go?" Ryoga muttered as soon as he materialized.<p>Ranma looked down the road, suddenly recognizing it. It was the same road he and Pop had traveled on to reach the Tendo house. But any similarity between the two ended there. This road was lined with burning houses and bodies. The sky was a pale red with dark gray clouds. It may have been raining or it may have been ash but Ranma couldn't really tell.<p>Without a word, he headed towards the Tendo's, knowing that that was where Akane was headed. As they tried to follow, the group suddenly realized the bodies that lined the road were moving.<p>"Survivors," Genma said moving towards them.<p>Mousse managed to grab his arm before he got very far. Genma turned around and looked at the young man, seeing recognition in his eyes. "Not survivors…" The bodies stood up. "Zombies."<p>* * *<p>Ranma could have sworn that he heard battle cries behind him. But he ignored them and pressed onward. As he did, he path was suddenly blocked by what appeared to be ten tiny daggers.<p>"Stop right there, Saotome," said a voice.<p>Ranma stopped and drew his sword, looking around for the source of the voice. "Where are you?"<p>"Right behind you," the voice said, just as Ranma felt something on his shoulder. Ranma turned around and only found air. "Or maybe someplace else."<p>"Look I don't have time for this," Ranma said. "I have someone more important to find."<p>"Oh that little sorceress… well, the Zombies carried her off already. Probably back to the center of town, they've been executing a lot of people there." Ranma paled and looked around, not knowing where the town center was. There was a rustle from a bush next to the road and a cloaked figure stepped out.<p>"My fight is with you," the figure said, "not the girl. Let's go find her and finish this later."<p>Ranma tried to understand exactly what the other guy meant but decided that nothing was important as finding Akane safe and sound. Nodding, he followed behind the cloak as they moved quickly through town.<p>Zombies tried to move against them but the two of them sliced through them like they were just fog. Just as the cloak stopped moving, Ranma heard what could only be Akane screaming at the top of her lungs. Not waiting any more, Ranma took off towards the yelling, running as fast as he could. It sounded like she was in trouble, like they were torturing her!<p>But when he arrived he found a quite different scene. It was the Zombies that were being flambéed as Akane hurtled Fire balls at them while screaming at them.<p>"This is for the school you burned down! This is for the store where I used to get bread from! This is for…"<p>"That's my girl. Show them how it's done!"<p>"Mr. Tendo?" Ranma said looking up and seeing Akane's father imprisoned in a cage lifted into the air.<p>"Ah Ranma," Tendo said looking down at him. "Nice of you to finally arrive. I see you've been doing a good job of protecting my little girl," he said as his head started to grow larger.<p>"This is for all the clothes you destroyed when you burnt my house!"<p>"She just ran off…" Ranma said, watching with horror as Tendo's head began breaking the cage as it grew.<p>"This is for grabbing me in the wrong place!"<p>"My only little girl, taken captive by Zombies with her fiancée no where in sight!" Soun cried as his head landed near Ranma. Ranma held onto his sword as best he could.<p>"Tendo!" Soun's face quickly deflated as he saw his friend Genma arriving with the reinforcements.<p>"Saotome!" Soun replied grabbing his friend in a tight embrace.<p>"I should have known a measly siege like this wouldn't do you in," Genma smiled.<p>"Yes well, unlike your son, a bunch of Zombies are no match for me," Soun replied.<p>"This is for thinking you could kidnap me!"<p>"Hey!" Ranma cried. "It wasn't a problem at all! I just didn't know the way until that guy in the cloak showed me where to go… where did he go."<p>"Of course," Soun said softly. "The 'guy in the cloak' made you almost miss saving my daughter."<p>"This is for putting my father in a cage!"<p>Ranma looked over as Akane toasted the last of the Zombies. "Yeah, like she needed any of my help. Half of them are toast on the ground and the rest of them are running away from her little fireball spell."<p>"LITTLE!" Akane said walking up to him. "Did you just call my Fireball spell little?"<p>"Akane, I didn't mean it like that," Ranma said backing up and breaking into a run as a fireball followed him.<p>* * *<p>"Nothing," Genma said as he rejoined Ryoga, Mousse and Soun at the center of town. "It looks like everything was destroyed. Even the weapons in the shop are melted or broken."<p>Soun shook his head. "We didn't even have time to prepare. They descended on us like locusts. Half the town was destroyed before some of us managed to get some weapons and send a messenger out. We held them off for as long as we could…" He trailed off and the other looked down at the ground.<p>"Pop, Mr. Tendo!" They looked over and saw Ranma waving his arms. "You better get up here!"<p>Genma and Soun took off, reaching Ranma location just in time to see Akane gently touch a robed figure on the ground. It looked like a beggar and his artificial leg was poking from underneath the cloak. Soun stopped suddenly.<p>"That's Nabiki's beggar costume," he said softly. Akane looked up at her father and back down at the crumpled mess on the ground. She bit her lip and reached down, grabbing the cloak and wiping it off.<p>The sky suddenly filled with gold as coins scattered. Akane had to duck to avoid getting hit but as soon as it was done, she looked at the uncovered mass. There was a bunch of flour bags, some hay and a note. She reached over and grabbed the note carefully.<p>Akane,<p>Kasumi and I are teleporting out of town. Dad's in trouble but we're  too out of practice to help him and we know you'll save him. We'll  try to get in contact later but until then, here's something for your  quest. Don't use it all at once.<p>Nabiki<p>Akane read it out loud and Soun smiled. "Smart girls. If I know them, they're already enjoying themselves on some tropical island." He paused. "Though it has been a while since they've practiced their magic…"<p>"How would Nabiki know that Akane would read the note," Genma asked.<p>Akane and Soun looked at each. "She just knows things," Soun replied.<p>Genma nodded and finally took notice of his son who was jumping around like an idiot crying "We're rich, we're rich, we're r… hey, why is this coin mushy… chocolate… NABIKI!"<p>* * *<p>In the shadows, a cloaked figure watched the tiny group. "You're safe for now Saotome but I'll follow you back to your camp and make you pay for you did to me. I'll get you back for all the years of torment and make you regret ever leaving me and making me follow this…"<p>"Stupid cloak talk too much." Before the figure could react a spear came down and landed on his head. Shampoo looked down at the figure with a shrug and dragged it back towards the center of town.
