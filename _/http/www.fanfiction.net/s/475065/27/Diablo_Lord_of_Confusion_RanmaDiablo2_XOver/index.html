</div><p style="text-align:center;"><b>STOP! READ THIS FIRST!</b></p><p style="text-align:center;">Okay... I don't know who did and because I never will, this is   the only place that I can state my peace and feel like I've done something about   what happened.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Thank you. Thank you <b>SO </b>much. A couple of   days ago I got a message from the Ranma FanFiction awards telling me I had won   second place in the continuing series. There's like about ten minutes of   complete disbelief before I'm so incredibly happy and proud.</p><p style="text-align:center;">I wanted to thank everyone who voted but I can't do it   individually so I'll thank you now. Thanks for reading the fic and   actually voting for it. I never hoped for anything like that to happen.   In fact, I'm surprised that so many of you are still reading this fic after so   long. I've always just written for the sheer joy of doing it and the hope   that other people might get some amusement out of it.</p><p style="text-align:center;">So anyway... go on and read the story, I know it's what you're   really here for. And thanks to Another Duck again for being my guinea...   ah, beta reader ^_^ again.</p>Act 5, Quest 2: Rescue on Mt. Arreat<p>Akane's hands dug into the fresh snow, looking for anything recognizable.   Each moment was torture, as if the next body part she came across would suddenly   be Ukyo's. The snow was melting around her, the power of Warmth slowly   overpowering the cold. But even as the ground was slowly revealed, it became   painful obvious that Ukyo was nowhere in sight.</p><p>Akane stopped digging and felt herself sniffle. Ukyo was not her best friend   and her only real rival for Ranma (if Akane forced herself to think of   herself in contention for him). But… but lately, it seemed that Ukyo had been   pulling them all together as group even when they were all fighting to stay   apart.</p><p>First Mousse, now Ukyo. It seemed like the people who kept this group   together were the first ones to get lost. Akane's eyes began to well up.</p><p>"Akane?" Ranma asked kneeling back at her.</p><p>"I don't want it anymore," Akane said suddenly. Shampoo and Ryoga stopped,   turning to face her.</p><p>"Don't want what?"</p><p>"I don't want Fire Mastery," she said. "Ever since I got it, I've been   messing things up." She turned to face Shampoo. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have   yelled at you. And I didn't listen to you," she looking at Ranma. "It makes me   think I'm so strong but… but all I'm doing is hurting people."</p><p>"Akane no hurt anyone," Shampoo said impassively.</p><p>"But I started the fight," Akane said. "And Ukyo tried to stop us but…but   none of us listened to her. And now she's gone. Just like Mousse."</p><p>"Don't be surprised," Ryoga said suddenly. "That's the way things work."</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Ranma said, turning over to the face the dour   man.</p><p>"In a war like this, everyone pretty much dies." He paused, suddenly looking   a bit sad. "Ukyo was just following that path."</p><p>Akane sob caught in her throat and Shampoo was looking coldly at Ryoga. But   before either of them could say anything, Ranma was heading towards him.</p><p>"Look, I know that you've had it rough the past couple of days," Ranma said,   walking towards Ryoga, "but there's no reason to say things like that."</p><p>"Why not?" Ryoga responded. "It's the truth."</p><p>"Ukyo's not dead," Ranma said firmly.</p><p>"Why would you care?" Ryoga replied. "It's not like you ever wanted her   around. You were the one that abandoned her when she was a kid, right?"</p><p>"I didn't abandon her!" Ranma snapped. "That was all my father's doing."</p><p>"Right… always blaming your pop. It must be nice to have a scapegoat like   that."</p><p>"Let it go, man. You're going to push me to far."</p><p>Ryoga looked at him with an angry eye. "Really? What happens when I push you   too far?"</p><p>Ranma glowered at him and shifted his feet in the snow.</p><p>"You're going to fight me?" Ryoga said.</p><p>"If that's what it takes to beat some sense into your head."</p><p>Ryoga pulled out his axe and threw it to the ground, tossing his armor next   to it. Ranma frowned and followed suit. Akane was about to stand up to put   herself between them but Shampoo grabbed her.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Akane cried, "they'll kill each other!"</p><p>"This fight long time coming," Shampoo said softly.</p><p>"But…"</p><p>Akane paused. The months of journeying played back through her mind. Ranma   and Ryoga always bickered and tried to out do each other. But Akane never   thought that would ever come to serious fighting. It was more like friendly   rivalry.</p><p>Looking at them now, anger dancing in their eyes, Akane was forced to wonder   if maybe it hadn't been friendly at all. If maybe it wasn't just anger in their   eyes. But hate.</p><p>The cold wind hit Genma like a ton of bricks. His hands clenched at the stony   grips as he tried to pull his body over the top of the ledge. Finally reaching   the plateau, he collapsed into the snow. Pushing off the ground, he looked around the area and found it completely   devoid of anything but snow. Nothing grew here; nothing moved. The master Druid   was right. This would be the perfect place to clear his mind.</p><p>He stumbled across the snow, finding a crack in the wall of the mountain and   stumbling inside. The cave was still cold but offered some protection from the   winter air. It would be enough for him to mediate without causing physical   damage.</p><p>He noticed that the cave actually stretched far into the back. Cautiously, he   walked down the path, wondering where it would lead. The paths were ice and   Genma fought to maintain his balance. The cave wound it's way deep into the   mountain and Genma was instantly on alert. This would be the perfect place for   an ambush, he realized.</p><p>There was sound in front of him and Genma tensed up. But as he came closer,   he realized that it was only the sound of water. The frozen river that ran   through the mountain had thawed here and leaning down, Genma could see straight   to the bottom. It was completely pure.</p><p>There was movement to his right and Genma spun around, gripping his staff to   prepare for his first spell. What he saw quickly abated his battle lust. Slowly,   he took a few steps forward, reaching out a hand to touch what he could only   pray was an apparition. But his hand made contact and Genma realized with horror that it was real.   Worse than that, he realized that this was not the only one.</p><p>Stretching around the frozen river and into the deep recesses of the cavern   paths, a long line of crosses, each adorned with the body of a barbarian, both   male and female. His stomach clenched as his mind realized the immensity of the   atrocity before him. He mind swam and he may have passed   out but he had suddenly caught sight of one of the crosses.</p><p>Walking over, he came face to face with the woman tied there. Her face was   covered with blood, her long black hair matted down to the skull. The eyes were   closed, as if she was simply asleep. But the stains on her clothes and the open   wounds that no longer bled made it clear that she was not sleeping. She was   dead.</p><p>Carefully, he cut down the body and brought it into his arms, slowly kneeling   on the ground. With a slow movement, he touched the dead woman's face. As soon   as his hand had passed her chin, it clenched in rage.</p><p>The demons that were assembling behind him were about to feel the full   strength of a master Druid.</p><p>Ryoga stumbled backwards, choking slightly on the blood that was filling his   mouth. The air around him became slightly misty as he breathed heavily.</p><p>"Had enough?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Ryoga laughed slightly. "Not even close."</p><p>He lunged forward sending a fist and a heel straight at his opponent. Ranma   dodged with a spin and came around his back ready to throw a devastating punch   at his back. But Ryoga was gone before the punch even cleared Ranma's side and   managed to deliver a strong punch to Ranma's upper arm in the process.</p><p>"This can't be the right thing to do," Akane asked, looking over at Shampoo.</p><p>"Akane no understand. Fighters like Barbarian, Paladin, Amazon… all need   fight to get out frustrations."</p><p>Akane looked over at the fighting pair with a frown. "I don't understand it."</p><p>"No, Sorceress no understand. So no like us."</p><p>"That doesn't mean that your way is the right one."</p><p>"Is right one for us," Shampoo said with a shrug. "Akane think they listen if   she say different?"</p><p>Akane's hands clenched. If only Mousse or Ukyo were here. Mousse was always   so smart, he'd think of a way to stop them. And Ukyo would jump in and stop   them, make them see what was wrong.</p><p>What good was all the fire power in the world now? She could use it to   decimate legions of the undead, call upon it to help her against the demons. But   now, when two of her friends were about to kill each other, she couldn't do a   thing.</p><p>She looked over at Shampoo but the amazon's face was impassive and her eyes   stared at the scene unfolding in front of her. Shampoo wouldn't do anything. If   anyone was going to do something… it would have to be her.</p><p>The animal scream rang through the caverns, causing icicles to shake and   break free from the wall. The demons hesitated for a moment, sensing their own   pointless demise if they dared to continue.</p><p>The Werewolf raged from his spot, howling into the sky as a rapid succession   of spells encompassed him. Fury welled up and turned the air red. Five ravens   circled above him in the air. Two large grizzly bears stood at his side and a   huge vine was growing up of the ground, slowly looping its way around them all.</p><p>The demons fell back just as the animals attacked. The sound of tearing flesh   filled the caverns quickly replacing the Werewolf's battle cry. The air became   thick with the smell of death as the ambush team was destroyed in seconds.</p><p>And then just as quickly as it began, it was over. The enemies were defeated   and the summoned monsters flickered out of existence. The Werewolf raged once   more before the fur began to disappear and humanity returned to the druid.</p><p>Genma closed his eyes and cleared his mind. Ironically, it turned out that   this was exactly what the master Druid had ordered him to do. His mind was   cleared of all questions and doubt. The path was clear.</p><p>Leaning down, he carefully wrapped the body at his feet in his cloak and   threw it over his shoulder. He began to walk back to the entrance of the cave   and paused looking back at the crucifixes behind him. He knew why they were keeping the bodies in here. Food for the demons. He   wouldn't all that indignity befall the bodies of these fallen heroes. He   brought up his hand, lips moving as he cast the most powerful spell he knew.</p><p>Armageddon exploded in the cave, meteorites scattering across the cavern from   the eruption in the air. They tore through everything in their path, leaving   only charred remains in their path.</p><p>Those remains caught fire and began burning. Suddenly the cavern began to   melt, slowly feeding the thawing river. The cavern filled with water, rushing   down through all the passageways, cleaning up any signs of destruction there and   purifying the mountain once more.</p><p>But by then, Genma had already returned to Harrogath.</p><p>"STOP IT!" Akane suddenly screamed, watching Ryoga land a blow in Ranma's   stomach. Ranma's knee buckled but he still managed to kick upwards, landing a   satisfying hit to Ryoga's stomach.</p><p>Akane ran forward and pushed between them. "Stop it… please," she said   softly. "This is why Ukyo left. She ran away because we were all fighting. If   she's here… if she's in this field somewhere…" Akane paused and looked at them.</p><p>"What would it have been for?" Akane cried looking at them. "If you keep   fighting, then her sacrifice meant nothing! I don't care if you think this is   the only way to solve your problems! You can't just kill each other. That's not   the right solution, it's just the easy way out.</p><p>"First Mousse, now Ukyo… they all sacrificed themselves for us, so that we   could keep going. And now we're going to toss that aside?" She looked over at   Shampoo, seeing the purple-haired Amazon looking at her sadly.</p><p>"Mousse is still alive, we owe him the chance of redemption by defeating this   army. And Ukyo… Ukyo could still be…"</p><p>There was crunching on the snow and the group turned. A barbarian stood   there, clearly out of breath.</p><p>"You need to get back to Harrogath," he managed to get out. "Genma-san found…   he found…"</p><p>But before he could even finish, the group was already running back towards   Harrogath.</p><p>In the middle of the war torn town, a wooden table sat onto of a pile of   chopped trees. A body lay on the table, draped in a white blanket. In front of   it, the master Paladin was chanting prayers.</p><p>The small group assembled there turned, watching as the group of heroes   suddenly arrived. No one said a word but stood silently as they caught their   breath, slowly taking in the situation.</p><p>Akane dropped to the ground first, clutching her sides as she began to cry.   Shampoo turned away, unwilling to let anyone see the grief that clutched her.   Ryoga's face was set in stone though his eyes were reflecting a sea of emotions.   Ranma locked eyes with his father, seeing the way the older man stared at the   table. Genma looked up at Ranma and he suddenly realized what was going on.</p><p>"It's not Ukyo," Ranma said suddenly.</p><p>The group looked up at him with surprise. No one contended the statement.   Suddenly a wave of relief hit the group. It wasn't her! Ukyo could still be   alive!</p><p>"It's not," Genma said, confirming their suspicions. "But…" He reached a hand   forward and placed it on the figure in front of him.</p><p>Akane felt it first, that crushing feeling of guilt that she took some joy in   someone else's death because it wasn't who she thought it was. But watching the   silent conversation between Ranma and his father, Akane suddenly realized that   he knew who it was.</p><p>"Ranma," she said softly, standing up and taking his hand in her own. "I'm so   sorry."</p><p>But Ranma didn't make a sound. He just watched the ritual proceed, staring   into the burning fire that took away the mother he never had the chance to know.</p><p>Hours later, in the quiet of the night, Harrogath seemed to be at peace once   more. The smell of smoke still lingered but would be gone by morning. Five   figures remained around the small pile of ash, trying to find the words.</p><p>So many months had passed, so many tragedies had befallen them. Somehow the   funeral pyre had reminded them of all that. Akane had seen Tristram burn once   more. Shampoo had felt the searing pain of a blow that should have ended her   life but instead forced Mousse to sacrifice his. And Ryoga saw all the bodies of   his fallen comrades in that one pyre.</p><p>Worse than all that was the realization that it really could have been Ukyo.   That her actions had led to her death because the rest of them were too caught up in   their own problems to realize the group was falling apart. That she had   committed the ultimate sacrifice to try to bring them together.</p><p>And in that realization came the reminder that they were all the same. Yes,   they were different in class, different in background, but similar in so many   other ways. They were comrades in arms, friends and had shared tragedies   together before.</p><p>Wordlessly, they reached an agreement. Akane had been right. Too many people   had sacrificed themselves to give the rest a chance to fight on. It was time to   end the arguments and enter the final battle.</p><p>Genma stood up first. "The demons are using the barbarians for food. I'd bet   that they kept a few pens of live ones."</p><p>Ryoga stood up and readjusted his armor. "It'll be further in from the   Overseer's location. Nothing is left there now."</p><p>"Let's go then," Ranma said, turning away, Akane following quickly behind.</p><p>As soon as they were gone, the ash on the ground shifted and caught itself in   the air, slowly dancing in the sky before disappearing amid the stars. A dim   light shown over the spent pyre and a few white feathers fell onto it.</p><p>"Was it really necessary?"</p><p>Nodoka Saotome feet touched the ground and her wings folded behind her. She   looked up at her fellow angel with a small smile. "It was the only way. Tragedy   will bring them together again. It's why Aiko sent her own daughter out as a   sacrifice."</p><p>"Yes… but shouldn't you have told them what happened after you died."</p><p>Nodoka looked over at her friend with a smile. "Well, I can't say I didn't   want my husband to suffer just a bit for taking my son away from me."</p><p>"That's not very angel like."</p><p>"I guess you've being doing this long then I have, Tendo-san," Nodoka replied. She   paused. "Your daughter is beautiful and strong. I'm glad Genma finally made a   good decision." Nodoka looked up at the sky. "Shall we go then?"</p><p>Her wings unfurled and she pushed off the ground, the action scattering the   last of the ashes away to the wind.</p><p>Shampoo pulled back the bowstring and waited for Ranma's signal. She looked   over at the pen, watching the barbarians milling about. Wearily she looked to   her left, watching Ryoga's growing anger.</p><p>They were alive, he realized. They were still more people left alive! But   trapped, like swine to be used for food. Despair was suddenly being replaced by   rage.</p><p>"Ryoga?" Shampoo asked. "Remember plan, right?" And despite the overpowering   anger, Ryoga nodded and waited for the signal as well.</p><p>There was a flash of light as Ranma cast Holy Bolt. The scream next to her   momentarily stunned Shampoo. But she pulled herself out of it and began to fire   her arrows. She knew what that was… it was War Cry, a master level Barbarian   skill.</p><p>And it had just taken out a whole mess of demons. They wobbled around,   stunned but alive. That was quickly taken care of when Ryoga suddenly went into   a Berserker rage and began to decimate them with Whirlwind.</p><p>The display of mastery didn't affect Shampoo though. She just concentrated on   firing her arrows, one after another until the space between them disappeared   and ten arrows flying out a time were being shot at once. In her   determination, she was casting Strafe without knowing it.</p><p>And then suddenly… there were no creatures left to fight. The barbarians in   the pen were cheering as Ryoga walked over and quickly made short work of the   lock. Akane walked over and cast a town portal spell, motioning them through.   Ranma talked to a few of them, learning that there were other pens around the   area.</p><p>But as the pen emptied out, something suddenly struck Ryoga. In the back,   hidden among his taller comrades was someone… someone very familiar.</p><p>As soon as he caught Ryoga's eye, the smaller man smiled. "You've been lost   for quite some time. But I figured you'd find your way here in the nick of   time."</p><p>"Andreas! You're alive!" Ryoga said crushing the other man in joy. He let go   and then threw a few slaps on his back.</p><p>"Not for long at this rate," Andreas replied, trying to recover from the   greeting.</p><p>"Have you seen anyone else?"</p><p>Andreas nodded. "There were a lot of people. But they just broke up one of   the pens, moved us all around."</p><p>"…brown hair? Sure I've seen her," one of the barbarians was saying. "Kind of   hard to miss since she was the only girl."</p><p>Ryoga's head snapped around and caught Ranma's eye. The paladin nodded. It   was Ukyo and she was still alive.</p><p>Ryoga turned back to Andreas but the little barbarian was next to the portal.   "Try not to get lost this time. I'll see you back home where I have two swords   that are just itching to get embedded in demon skin."</p><p>Ukyo frowned at the lock on the gate and then at the guards at the door. She   was still tired from the forced march to this new pen but she should have been   glad that she was alive. Too many of her penmates had not moved but rather were   sent into one of the portals of Hell.</p><p>In fact, she would have been glad, if she didn't know the reason they were   keeping her alive. Killing the Overseer apparently meant that normal demon food   was not good enough of a punishment. She was going to get the joy of meeting the   head demon himself.</p><p>Good, she had told her captors. I'll make sure to tell him exactly how we   killed his two brothers.</p><p>Which turned out not to be the smartest thing to say, she thought, lightly   touching her mangled side. Alive apparently did not include unharmed. The   barbarians had helped her, though, bandaged her side and helping her stay up   during the march.</p><p>That's why she was determined to get them out. Even though her fate was   pretty much sealed, she wasn't going to let them turn up as demon food. But that   lock was more then she could handle. Playing sick probably didn't matter much to   the guards. And well… they were the undead so appealing to their sexuality   wasn't going to work either.</p><p>Ukyo sighed and leaned against the side of the wall. She shouldn't even be   alive to have to worry about this. But leave it her luck to not get killed with   the Overseer. Now, she actually had time to worry.</p><p>She worried about the barbarians, of course. But she worried more about her   comrades. Did they even know she was alive? Did they even care? She could only   hope that what she had done had given them the chance to keep fighting.</p><p>Suddenly there was an explosion and Ukyo heard a battle cry. The area outside   of the pen erupted into a sea of fire, arrows and axes. Ukyo pressed against the   grate, looking out as the demon forces were slowly decimated. And then the smoke began to clear and there were people walking towards   them. The   barbarians were cheering and Ukyo found herself biting her lip to keep the   emotions in.</p><p>Ryoga walked up, axe in hand and looked at her angrily. "Do you remember in   Hell, when I said when someone is in trouble, we don't just sit around and cry   about it. That we figured out how to help them and then we helped them."</p><p>Ukyo nodded slightly. "Of course… it's why… it's the only thing…"</p><p>"Sacrificing yourself is not following that advice," he interrupted, smashing   the lock with his axe. "It didn't help us at all, so never try it again."</p><p>Ukyo smiled slightly, knowing he was lying. Akane and Shampoo suddenly   enveloped her in a hug. She tried not to protest too much as she felt the   crunching of her broken ribs but they seemed to sense the injury and loosened   their grips a bit.</p><p>She looked over at Ranma. "What Ryoga said," he managed to get out, before   joining the group hug. "Come on Ryoga… join the love."</p><p>"Shut up, Ranma," Ryoga said before Akane grabbed his arm and pulled him to   the group.</p><p>"We're together again," she said with a smile. "We're back as a group."</p><p>"Will stay that way," Shampoo said firmly. "No more fighting with friends,"   she said to Ranma and he nodded slowly.</p><p>"No more not working as a group," Akane said.</p><p>"No more bad grammar!" Ranma said with a smile that earned him a scowl from   Akane.</p><p>"Baka!" Akane said. "Like you even know what grammar is."</p><p>"Hey," Ukyo said suddenly. "No more nosebleeds!" she said looking at Ryoga.   And the little gears in Ryoga's head turned and calculated that this time there   were three beautiful half-dressed women clutching him.</p><p>"Crap," he said, stepping backwards to gain his balance as his nose began to   ache. The group laughed.</p><p>"I'm glad to see we're back together," Genma said rejoining them. "I found   the next pen. It's about three kilometers to the north. If we're lucky, we can   still catch them by surprise."</p><p>"Good," Ranma said. "Ukyo, go back to town to get healed. Shampoo, scout   ahead, give us a count on demons. Akane, we'll need you to cast some fire walls   from the back and re-enchant the weapons. Ryoga… dude, just do the whole blender   routine and we'll be fine. Wait for my signal and we'll attack. Okay?"</p><p>The group nodded and Akane stuck his hand out. Ukyo's quickly followed suit,   then Shampoo, Ryoga, and Genma. Ranma looked at them with a smile before putting   his hand of top.</p><p>No more questions. They were going to fight as a group. And they were going   to win.</p>
