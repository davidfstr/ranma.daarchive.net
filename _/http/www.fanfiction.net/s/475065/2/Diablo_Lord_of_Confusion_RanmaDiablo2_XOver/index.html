</div>Author's note:<p>WOW! What a response. Thank you everyone and you know, I never thought of making Ranma's girl side another class but now.<p>I actually have finished the game so I do know where all of this headed. even Tristram. My boyfriend and I spent the better part of the autumn running around Battlenet with our Ranma named characters that actually is where this story idea came from..<p>Oh and for the non-Diablo fans. Fallen are tiny demons who can be raised from the dead by a Fallen Shaman. Rule number 1 when playing D2. always kill the Shaman first.<p>* * *<p>Act 1 : Quest 1<p>The Den of Evil<p>Akane Tendo's feet were more worn out then she ever remembered. The constant march of the past few days was finally taking their toll on her. But she couldn't bring herself to ask the two men in front of her to slow down. She already felt like enough of a burden to them as it was.<p>The two weeks following the leave from Tristram had been fairly uneventful.  The walk to the Rouge's territory had taken them through well traveled and therefore was relatively safe. In fact, the only time Akane had ever gotten to use her spells is to start the evening fire and that had been less than successful. She had burned most of the food Kasumi had given them for their trip after which they refused to let her near anything they caught.<p>Ranma and his father seemed rather uncomfortable having her around and they kept asking her whether she needed help with her pack, as if she were too weak to carry it! It annoyed her that she hadn't had the ability to show them that she could fend for herself. All she needed was a few monsters to prove her worth.<p>But they never came. So most of the time was spent with Genma rattling off stories of the Skeleton King and the Sin War while Ranma tried not to look too bored and Akane tried to keep pace with them. It was only after they saw the outskirts of the Rouge territory that things got very interesting.<p>There was something in the air that made them realize something was wrong. A burning smell that could only indicate a recent battle. As they continued towards the main city of the Rouges, they found the ground littered with bodies. Some were human but others appeared to be hideously deformed. For the first time, Akane was actually afraid and she clutched tightly to the wand, a spell on the tip of her lips.<p>Ranma drew out his Paladin's sword and grasped tightly on the shield. He shot a look over to his father who looked deep in meditation. He was probably preparing to shape-shift at a moment's notice. Ranma stole a glance back at Akane and found her gazing back at him with grim determination and a look that seemed to say "back off I can take care of myself."<p>He turned away angry. What kind of girl was this fiancée of his? It's not like he asked her to come along. He had been against this the whole time. And she was so pig-headed and uncute and a tomboy and.<p>Ranma froze, his sword arm drew back quickly. There was movement in the air and it seemed that Genma was thinking the same thing. Akane made a small sound but a look from both men told her to keep quiet.<p>Then they heard. A terrible guttural scream and the ground shook beneath them. Ranma fell to the floor but managed to keep a hand on his weapon. He shot a look over to Akane and saw a shadow rapidly falling over her face. Without a moment's hesitation he grabbed her and sprang forward, narrowly avoiding the huge battle axe as it crashed to the ground.<p>"You!" the enemy screamed. "This is all your fault!" He pointed the axe towards Akane. "Because of you I have seen he. wait a minute. Why isn't your hair red? Did you think that you could dye it to avoid me?"<p>"What are you talking about?" Akane screamed from her position on the ground. A position she suddenly realized included two male arms looked around her waist and one hand in a very compromising position on a very delicate part of her chest.<p>The barbarian forgotten, Akane's anger flared towards Ranma. "Hentai!" she screamed, grabbing her staff and knocking him squarely on the face and into the air.<p>The barbarian watched the exchange with interest and saw that the red-hot rage of the fallen sorceress was now directed at him. "Now," Akane said, her breath coming very quickly. "What were you saying?"<p>The barbarian's battle face fell and a huge goofy grin broke out instead. "Ha ha, my mistake there's no way you were the same girl. I mean she was dainty and ladylike and didn't hit." He paused, realizing that he had just made a huge mistake.<p>But by then it was too late and the barbarian was sent off into the clouds following the Paladin.<p>* * *<p>Ranma-chan cursed as she pulled herself out of the pond. Leave to Akane to find the only pound in the whole freaking forest. She stood up and wrung out her Paladin clothes, which were now much too large for her.<p>"THERE YOU ARE!"<p>Ranma-chan turned and she was met with a splash of water that knocked her to the ground. She stood up, sputtering and cursing and suddenly felt a sharp pain on her leg. Looking down, she found a little black piglet clamped tightly on, apparently trying to rip her to shreds.<p>With a curious look, she picked the pig up and gave him a good look. "What's the problem?" she demanded.<p>The pig squealed and tried to wrench free but Ranma-chan had a tight grip on him. With a sigh, Ranma-chan stood up and walked towards the pool of water to retrieve her sword. She was quite surprised to find that in addition to the sword there was a huge battle-axe and what appeared to be barbarian furs.<p>Barbarian axe. pig. barbarian furs. pig. the thoughts turned around in Ranma-chan's mind until she finally, in a burst of brilliance, put two and two together.<p>"You're that barbarian that was cursed?" The little pig squealed in anger.  "Hey don't get made at me, that's what you get for not keeping your promises." The pig twirled in his hands but stopped as he heard some noise coming from the forest.<p>"Ranma! There you are!"<p>Ranma-chan scrunched down prepared for another one of Akane's blows but it never came.<p>"Oh!" Akane squealed. "What a cute piglet!" She ran up and grabbed the black piglet from Ranma-chan's embrace and hugged it tightly to her chest. "You are too cute! And what a cute little fur collar! I think I'll call you P-chan."<p>"Ah, Akane," Ranma-chan started. She stopped short as she caught Akane's angry glare and the barbarian pig's pleading look. Ranma-chan sighed, it was a little bit her fault that he was cursed like this. With a shrug, Ranma-chan gathered up the barbarian's clothes and axe in her arms, trying not to fall over from the sheer weight of them.<p>"Ranma," Genma said as he rejoined the group. "Did you find the barbarian that attacked us?"<p>Ranma-chan sighed. "Yeah, but he's okay, it was all a mistake. He said he'd meet up with us after he went back to his camp and picked some stuff up."<p>Genma shrugged. "All right then let's get moving. I think I saw a camp fire not too far from here." Akane nodded and gripped tightly onto the piglet, oblivious to the discomfort Ranma-chan was in as she dragged the equipment behind her.<p>* * *<p>Ranma sat by the fire and watched the metal pot of water start to boil. Akane and Genma had gone off immediately after the arrived at the encampment. Apparently, their fears were right, there was something terribly wrong with the rouges. But before Ranma could ponder the matter further, there was a rustling of the grass next to him as a tiny black piglet came and sat next to him. Taking the water he poured on the piglets head and turned away as the now human barbarian put his clothes back on.<p>"I would thank you but seeing as this is all your fault." he started.<p>Ranma sighed. "Look, I'm sorry. I mean, I didn't want you to be a pig but if maybe you had just followed directions and." The barbarian was silent as he pushed the embers of the fire with his axe. "At least you found the seer with the magic water."<p>The barbarian shuddered. "Don't remind me," he said.<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow. "What's the problem? I mean pop just said it took a little bribing and." the barbarian shuddered again. "Look never mind about that. It was a temporary fix. My pop and I are here for the real thing, the permanent cure."<p>"Yeah?" The barbarian asked.<p>"Sure and since this is sort of my fault, why don't you tag along with us for the cure? I'm Ranma Saotome," he said, sticking out his hand. "Paladin in training from Tristram."<p>The barbarian looked at his hand. "Ryoga Hibiki, barbarian from Harrogath."<p>"Harrogath. man that's far. and cold."<p>Ryoga snickered. "You wouldn't last a minute there."<p>"Oh well, my pop and I have been all over the world," Ranma said.<p>"Yeah, well so have I," Ryoga shot back.<p>"Well," Genma said as he and Akane reached them. "It's nice to see you too getting along. Ranma."<p>"Yeah, right. Pop, this is Ryoga, he's from Harrogath. That's Akane." Ryoga gave a blushed nod towards her.<p>"Sorry about before," he said softly.<p>"That's all right," Akane replied quickly, not ready to admit she was partly in the wrong.<p>"So what didya find out?" Ranma asked.<p>"The rouges aren't very talkative," Genma replied. "And they're afraid. From what I can gather, this is their last outpost."<p>"What?" Ranma asked. "But the rouge territory stretches for days!"<p>Genma nodded grimly. "Yes and something has gone terribly wrong. Something has corrupted this land." He paused. "And I am afraid I have seen this before."<p>"The only thing the rouges would say," Akane picked up, "was that we should talk to their priestess. But we can't find her anywhere."<p>"Ah. you looking for rouge priestess?"<p>The group jumped and turned towards the voice. There a short man with eyes that were almost shut stared at them.<p>"Is very tragic story," he continued. "15 months ago, very evil force come and corrupt rouges. Good ones flee but get killed until all that left is here."<p>"Ah, who are you?" Akane asked.<p>"I guide, traveler. I wait to go east but no go until road cleared. If I go, I take you there with me."<p>"That's okay," Ranma said. "All we need is to find the rouge priestess."<p>"And get out of here quick," Genma added. Ranma shot him a disapproving look.<p>"Oh okay," the guide said. "You go see priestess, all way at edge of camp.  She tell you what need know."<p>Ranma nodded and stood up. "All right, let's go." Ryoga grabbed his axe and walked after Ranma, followed quickly by Genma.<p>Akane looked around the fire. "Hey, has anyone seen P-chan?"<p>* * *<p>Tucked away at the edge of camp, a tiny tent fluttered in the wind. Perfumed smoke pillowed out of the top while feathers and charms pulled at the sides. Ranma walked slowly to the entrance, aware that everyone had stopped several meters in back of him. With a tentative hand, he went to knock on the flap.<p>Before he could do anything, it was thrown open and someone dressed in a billowing red robe stepped out. Ranma looked down to see who it was and let out a terrified scream. Behind him, the three others did as well.<p>"What's the matter boy?" came a crackling voice. "Are you afraid of the power of the great Rouge Priestess Cologne?"<p>Ranma slowly regained his strength. "No, but your face is powerful enough to make a mule."<p>"Ranma, my boy," Genma said, hurrying forward and grabbing Ranma's arm. "Now be polite. I'm sure you didn't want to insult the lovely. AH!" He screamed. The rest of the group did as well.<p>Genma strained against his urge to run as looked down at the withered face.  It turned out the robes took up more space than the old woman herself. "Ah." he stuttered. "Ah."<p>"What's the matter?" Cologne demanded.<p>"Well, you see. " he stammered, trying to regain control, "we've traveled a long and arduous journey to find a cure for a curse that was. cast upon us by evil sorcerers."<p>Cologne raised an eyebrow. "In other words, you managed to curse yourselves." She sighed. "This is why magic was never meant for mortals."  She looked up at Ranma and gestured with her finger. "Come here, my boy."  Ranma carefully leaned forward until he was face to face with the old ghoul. "Tell me what's your problem."<p>Ranma was about to speak when he felt a rush of cold water over his head. He quickly shrank into girl form. Ranma-chan whipped around and looked at a guilty Genma who still had the ladle in his hand.<p>"What didya do that for!" she cried.<p>"It's easier to show then explain with words," Genma replied. But it as too little too late as Ranma picked up a nearby branch and swung it at him, sending Genma off into the distance.<p>"Ah," Cologne said. "I see."<p>Ranma-chan turned around quickly. "So you have a cure?"<p>Cologne sighed. "Possibly. but first you must do something for me."<p>"Anything!" Ranma-chan cried.<p>"There's a den in the middle of Blood Moor that has been overrun with monsters. I need you to clear it out."<p>Ranma-chan laughed. "Ha! No problem. I'll have it done before you know it."<p>"We'll have it done," Akane said stepping forward. Ranma-chan looked at her. "We're a team right?" she asked, though the question really had no answer except a full agreement on Ranma's part.<p>"Right!" Ranma-chan said laughing nervously. "Now let's get some hot water and find pops. Thanks again, we'll be back before you know it," she said waving to Cologne as he jogged off with Ryoga and Akane behind him.<p>As soon as they were gone, Cologne turned to the tent. "You can come out now."<p>A tall Amazon emerged from the tent, her purple hair cascading down her back. "You think he strong enough."<p>"I hope so my dear," Cologne said. "Otherwise, you'll never be rid of your curse."<p>* * *<p>Ranma adjusted the last strap of his armor before he shot a look over to his father. "Are you sure you're not coming with us?"<p>Genma shook his head and lay against a rock. "Someone needs to stay behind and make sure these rouges don't get into any more trouble."<p>Ranma rolled his eyes. Leave it to his old man to become a coward right before he was needed most. Not that it mattered, it wouldn't be hard clearing out this den and he sure didn't need that tomboy Akane messing thin.<p>"Okay, I'm ready!" Akane yelled. Looking cautiously over, Ranma saw she had adjusted all of her armor and was gripping her wand tightly. "Let's go!" she started to walk off towards the exit of camp.<p>Ryoga came next to him and whispered. "How does she stay warm in that?"<p>Ranma looked at him intently. "Warmth."<p>Ryoga nodded and started to walk away but Ranma got a good grip on him and pulled him in the right direction. Genma watched them walk off, a small smile on his face. Ranma had been with him too long, he needed friends his own age.<p>He was about to nod off when he noticed something moving in the shadows. He didn't move but watched the lithe form quickly follow after the small group. As soon as she was gone, Genma got more comfortable near the fire. Ranma will deal with it.<p>* * *<p>"Ow!" Akane cried. Looking down she saw a tiny pin embedded in her leg. "Something just hit me!" She called to boys behind her. Ranma ran up and looked down at her leg.<p>"Okay, stay here. Ryoga, let's go flush them out." Ryoga grunted a reply and withdrew his axe. Akane was about to protest but they had already disappeared. Oh how typical, they figured she would be of no help to them so they just leave her behind while they get to have all the fun. How did they think she would ever learn anything if they didn't give her the chance to fight?<p>There was a rustling near her and Akane turned, determined to give them a piece of her mind. Instead of Ranma and Ryoga, however, there were two horrible looking zombies walking towards her. Their flesh hung limply on their limbs and they moaned as they dragged their legs to the ground.<p>Akane suppressed the urge to scream and realized that the chance that she had wanted. As they taught her in school, she concentrated on a picture of a flame in her mind, feeding it every thought, fear, desire that was in her mind until it glowed so intensely that she couldn't contain it.<p>The spell flew from her lips and her wand glowed. Fireballs erupted from her outstretched hands and hit the zombies repeatedly until they crumpled to the ground. Several seconds after the threat was gone, Akane still sat there breathing hard, her arms locked in attack mode.<p>Ranma and Ryoga came tumbling towards her, holding the carcasses of a few dead animals. They both stopped short when they saw the smoldering pile of zombies in front of Akane.<p>"Woah," was Ranma's only reply. Ryoga looked a bit pale. "Hey Akane, you okay?"<p>Akane suddenly snapped out of her trance. She looked at the ground and saw the dust. "Ah, yeah, I think so."<p>Ryoga walked over to the pile of debris and started to sift through it. "Well, there's some gold, a couple of arrows and." he held of part of a zombie's foot still attached to some boots. But before he could add it to the pile of items, they disintegrated in the breeze.<p>"Wow Akane, you really toasted these guys!" Ryoga exclaimed. "You must be at least at level 20 sorceress."<p>Akane began to blush fiercely. "Actually, I just graduated level 2 but. you really think so?"<p>"Yeah, that firebolt could've taken out a whole clan of Fallen," Ryoga said grinning, "or a mess of Hell Bovines."<p>"First of all," Ranma said, getting a bit upset. "There is no such thing as Hell Bovines, everyone knows that. Secondly, yeah okay she cast a good spell but any level 1 sorceress can cast a simple fire bolt. Let's just get moving," he said moving ahead of them. Ryoga shrugged and started to move off but Akane grabbed Ranma's arm.<p>"Hey," she said to him. "What's the matter?"<p>"Nuthin," he said gruffly.<p>"You know, if I didn't know better," Akane said with a sly grin, "I'd say you're jealous." She skipped away before he could answer but that didn't stop him from yelling after.<p>"Now wait just a sec. Ryoga? Okay, where the hell did Ryoga go?"<p>* * *<p>Five hours later (and twenty-seven wrong turns later) Ranma, Ryoga and Akane finally stumbled upon the entrance of the Den of Evil. As Ryoga sharpened his battle-axe and Akane brushed up on her spells, Ranma concentrated on his ki and began to push it outward, causing a soft blue aura's to form around his companions.<p>"A heal aura," Ryoga said, somewhat impressed. "But watch this." He leapt up into the air and let out a mighty cry before hitting the ground with a thump. Everyone suddenly felt a little bit stronger.<p>"Oooh, my turn, my turn!" Akane said. She paused and concentrated, bringing up the spell from memory. The boys cringed expecting to be engulfed in flames but instead the target was their weapons. "Ha, I knew it would work."<p>"Ah. thanks," Ryoga said examining his red axe. "Fire-enchanted?"<p>"Uh huh," Akane said with a smile. "Fire is my specialty."<p>"Good," Ranma said. "We'll need it down there. Ryoga, you and I will concentrate on taking out the stronger enemies. Akane, cover us with fire spells." The group nodded in agreement. "Let's go."<p>Down they descended into the dark recesses of the Den of Evil. Despite the warmth spell, even Akane felt the coldness of this place so that her skin became goose bumped. Ranma led, his aura creating a tiny circle of light so that they could see in front of them. The sounds of the forest ebbed away and were replaced by an eerie echo of moans and growls.<p>The trio slowly walked through the first cavern, careful not to make a sound. Ranma shot out a hand suddenly, pointing to a bunch of shadows that were dancing on the wall. He could make what were small horns and small hands that held large clubs.<p>"Fallen," he whispered. Akane and Ryoga nodded. "Remember the plan."<p>Ranma took a deep breath. He was used to fighting with his father but not with other people especially inexperienced ones. Well, Ryoga might have the experience but Akane. he didn't want to have to worry about her. He shot a look over and caught himself about to smile. She almost looked cute when she was preparing for a fight.<p>Ranma shook himself out of his reverie. What was he thinking? This was no time for fiancées. This was time to fight.<p>Without another word, Ranma moved forward, letting loose a battle cry as he raised he sword to make the first strike. The Fallen tribe was taken by surprise allowing them a few quick kills before they realized what was going on. But seconds after the foes fell, the little red devils sprung back to life.<p>"Shaman!" Ranma cried. He barely saw Ryoga move next to him. With a mighty cry the barbarian leapt up from the fray and jumped over the minions to reach the Fallen shaman.<p>From her vantage point, Akane could barely make out friend or foe. She carefully cast fire spells, trying more to distract the enemy then kill them off. However, after several spells, she began to feel tired. Realizing her mistake, she began to search for a mana potion only to find there was none.<p>She tried to cast a few more spells but she was really starting to feel the drain. Suddenly, the second wave of Fallen came. Akane never expected it and she could tell the others didn't either. Fallen tribes tended to not get along and would never actually come to the aid of another tribe.<p>"Akane, look out behind you!" Ranma called out.<p>Akane whipped around and saw a third tribe of Fallen heading towards her. Before she had time to question why yet another tribe had joined the fight, they fell unto her like a wave. Her mana exhausted, Akane did the only thing could and began to lash out with her wand, striking demon after demon squarely on the head.<p>But for every shot she made, she could feel them making at least three blows on her body. Her armor was taking a lot of the damage but she could already feel consciousness slipping away as she was slowly buried underneath a growing pile of fallen corpses.<p>Ranma watched with dread as Akane started to disappear underneath the red tide. This was all wrong, he realized, it had to be a trap. His aura started to waver a bit as his body took more and more hits. There had to be around 50 Fallen now cramped into the tiny cavern.<p>Ryoga was having a very hard time with the Shaman. Its fire spells were really starting to do some damage. Finally, Ryoga managed to get in a nice head blow and the shaman crumpled. He was about to help Ranma when he heard an all to familiar sound behind him. Turning around he saw the Shaman grinning evilly at him just as the second Shaman joined him. With a sigh, Ryoga bent down, bringing his axe to his side to prepare for the renewed attack.<p>It was all over, Akane thought as she felt herself falling to the ground. They had been beaten in their first battle. With the ebb of conscious falling away, she felt the last remains of her pride fall away as well. And when that happened she was no longer afraid to admit that she was not strong enough to win this battle.<p>"RANMA!"<p>Ranma heard his fiancées' anguished cry and something inside of him changed. The aura around him flashed from peaceful blue to a dark, wicked red. The demon around jumped as flames exploded on them. Ranma moved forward, his sword slashing at anything in his way. The aura began to burn anything in his path so that by the time he reached Akane, most of the Fallen had made way to let him through.<p>The Fallen noticed that their tribesmen were not getting up. Ryoga stood in the distance with a smile, the two Shaman crumpled at his feet. With a cry of victory he started to run after the Fallen, slicing them down now that they could not be revived. The survivors scattered, running as quickly as they could.<p>As the chameber emptied out, Akane opened her eyes. She slowly pushed her way off the ground, surprised to see Ranma kneeling next to her.<p>"Are you okay?" he asked, handing her a potion.<p>Akane nodded, drinking in the sweet brew. She could feel her wounds starting to close up. She tossed the empty flask aside. She looked up at Ranma, his face covered with dirt and Fallen blood, his ponytail almost coming undone. She blushed a bit and stammered for the right words.<p>"Thank you," she said. "You were right, I'm just a level 1 Sorceress. I got over confident."<p>Ranma sighed. "Well, you have a hell of a wand whack then," he said. "You must have taken out a dozen of them." He sighed. "I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I mean you really can hit for a girl."<p>Akane raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean, for a girl?"<p>"Well you know. most fighters are guys 'cause we're stronger and quicker."<p>"You're also a hell of a lot stupider," Akane shouted, getting very defensive.<p>"What?" Ranma said. "Hey I was just trying to compliment you!"<p>"By telling me that girls can't fight as well as a guy?"<p>"Oh man! I don't know why I even try! Look it's just a fact!"<p>"I know plenty of woman who could knock you flat on your ass, you uncoth, ill mannered."<p>"Look who's talking you uncute, tomboy!"<p>"Oh that's it!" Akane cried. "I don't know why I even bothered trying to talk to a pervert like you!"<p>"Yeah, well I should have just let you get eaten by the Fallen. But they probably wouldn't even want a scrawny little."<p>"Who the hell are you calling scrawny!" Akane yelled back. "You. you. cold- hearted."<p>"Thin-skinned."<p>"Empty-headed."<p>"Weak as straw."<p>"Dumb as dirt."<p>"KAWAIIKUNE!"<p>"HENTAI"<p>The room suddenly lit up as sunlight began to filter in. They both squinted as their eyes readjusted. In the distance, they heard what could have been a barbarian celebration.<p>".LAST ONE! HEY GUYS, I THINK I GOT THE LAST ONE! AH. where am I?"
