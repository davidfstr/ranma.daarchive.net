</div>            Author's Note: As usual. I still don't own any characters but my originals. . From here on: Scene Change = ****, Scene Break = -.<p>Tranquility Protocols, Chapter 4<p>Ryoga sat on the wash stool and studied the jar he held. The liquid inside was colorless and clear, just like normal water. There was no scent to give it away. Just pour it over warm food and who ever ate the food would be affected. Pouring it in water was less effective but sake, on the other hand, made it even more powerful. Probably because sake was normally served warm.<p>It was a love potion. His chance to get Akane to love him. Or maybe to get Ranma to love someone else. Ryoga shuddered as he remembered the Koi rod incident. And the Feng Gao Sha. And the Dim Sum. He sighed. And then he carefully turned the open jar upside down over the drain. Cold water was an effective neutralizing agent, rendering the potion non-magical. He briefly wondered why Cologne had told him of the counter, but shrugged it off. She had reasons for doing everything, and she rarely enlightened mere males.<p>Aiming the sprayer carefully, Ryoga turned on the cold water. He let it run for several moments before adding hot water. When the spray was nearly neutral, he washed the jar and filled it with water. Then he turned the cold water off completely. Placing the jar back in his pack, he returned and luxuriated in the scalding spray before completing his bath in the warm furo.<p>Outside the furo door, Cologne nodded to herself. About what she had expected of the young man. She smiled and hopped down the hallway on her staff. This would indeed be interesting.<p>In another part of Nerima, eight seifuku clad young ladies stared in astonishment at Senshi Nike. Before they could all began talking at once, Nike held up her hand for silence. They paused expectantly.<p>"Don't worry about it."<p>The crash of eight faces hitting the floor was enough to shake the house.<p>"That had to hurt," Aurora commented. Vulcan nodded agreement.<p>"Don't worry about it?" Mars shrieked as she sprang to her feet. "How can we not worry about it? Do you know how powerful Pluto is? How the heck are we supposed to stop her?" She was leaning over Nike, screaming in her face.<p>Nike reached up and placed one finger against Mars' nose. A gentle push tumbled the fiery Senshi back into her seat. "Don't worry about it. If the time comes, you'll do it without thinking about it. And Pluto isn't really all that powerful. Any one of us could stop her."<p>"Ha," Uranus snorted derisively. "Pluto controls time. Not much you can do against that."<p>Nike laughed. "Pluto is the <i>Guardian</i> of the Time Gates. She doesn't control time any more than I do. If she uses the Gate to manipulate time too much then she'll activate the Time Protocols and get swatted. The Inner Senshi are the ones who get to do the swatting."<p>Mercury looked up from her computer. "She's right. And there are emergency scenarios in here for each of us. Even Tranquility-hime and Serenity-hime. Basically if any of us turn rogue or get consumed by the Dark, certain things will occur to prevent us from misusing our power. Usually this will result in the choosing of a replacement Senshi."<p>Silence fell as Serenity's Senshi digested this information.<p>"What about Tuxedo Kamen?" Moon suddenly asked. "He was controlled by Beryl and nothing happened. And all his generals too."<p>"If you mean the Earth Prince, Endymon," Aurora said, "He didn't have enough power to be a threat, so there were no safety protocols for him and his men. Between them they could hardly control the weather, let alone threaten a planet. The protocols were only in place for Senshi because we are capable of ruining all life on any of the planets, or even outright destroying them."<p>Nike snickered. "I recall that Endymon wasn't good at anything but conjuring flowers. Which of course is why Serenity-hime likes him." She nodded toward Sailor Moon.<p>"What's wrong with conjuring flowers?" Moon demanded.<p>"Nothing at all, Princess," Nike replied. "Nothing at all."<p>Saotome Nodoka woke at peace with the world. All was right and calm. She recognized the guest room at the Tendo's home. Her son was the only one sleeping here now that her own house had been repaired. She noticed a distinct lack of personal marks, almost as if Ranma was only passing through. After two years she would have expected something to make the room seem like a boys room. She sighed and sat up.<p>Next to the futon someone had laid out the cameras. Nabiki's Nikon 750 and her Polaroid as well as the disposable that Nodoka had bought. The picture leaning against the Polaroid caught her eye. In it were six girls. Their features were blurred, as was common when taking pictures of Senshi, but their clothing identified them as the new Senshi. She recognized the three she had pictures of already. The picture was also signed, apparently by the subjects. Senshi Nike, her rescuer; Senshi Aurora and Senshi Vulcan, who had been seen in Juban; Senshi Harmony, with white hair and a black fuku; Senshi Velocity, with a long blue braid; and Senshi Alexis, who's name was spelled out in Katakana underneath a mathematical equation.<p>The sound of combat drew her out of her stunned reverie. She grabbed the cameras while scrambling to her feet and dashed out the door. A moment later she dashed back in the room, scooped up her Family Blade and scurried out again.<p>The sight which greeted her as she reached the bottom of the stairs nearly caused her heart to stop. Her son, in his girl form, was attacking one of the Senshi. The other Senshi were all standing around watching. Kasumi was serving lemonade and Nabiki was trying to convince one of the Senshi to take a bet. Akane and Ukyo were cheering for Ranma and another young lady was idly tossing crumbs into the Koi pond.<p>"Ranma!"<p>"Oh, hi Mom," OnnaRanma said. She evaded a punch and leapt over a sweep kick. "Be right with ya. Sailor Jupiter wanted me to judge her skill." She landed and tucked into a forward roll that brought her inside the Senshi's guard. Nodoka gasped in surprise as OnnaRanma drew back a fist. And tapped the girl on the nose with her other hand.<p>Jupiter's eyes crossed and she stumbled a few steps backward. OnnaRanma bowed and waved off the laughter. She nodded to Uranus. "I'll be right with you." And she came over and stood in front of Nodoka. "Yes, momma?"<p>"Ranma, won't you introduce me to your friends?"<p>OnnaRanma raised an eyebrow, then shrugged. She led Nodoka to stand in front of Sailor Moon. The other Senshi gathered around their leader.<p>"This is my mother, Saotome Nodoka. Mother, this is Serenity-hime, also known as Sailor Moon." The named girl hopped to her feet and bowed. "Serenity-hime is engaged to Tuxedo Kamen, but he's not available at the moment."<p>Nodoka started kneel, but Sailor Moon stopped her. "Don't get your kimono all dirty. I more of a princess in training." She was blushing slightly.<p>OnnaRanma gestured to the others. "These are Sailor Mercury, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mars, and Sailor Jupiter. They're the Inner Senshi." Each girl bowed as she was named and Nodoka bowed back.<p>"And these are the Outers," OnnaRanma continued, "Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus, and Sailor Saturn, the Silence Bringer." Saturn blushed a little at the tone of OnnaRanma's voice. Neither the blush nor the tone escaped Nodoka's notice.<p>"Sailor Pluto," OnnaRanma began.<p>"Is right here," a new voice announced right behind her.<p>Only those who knew OnnaRanma well recognized her tensing for attack and the self-control that stopped her. The Senshi were impressed with her lack of reaction to Pluto's sudden arrival.<p>"Sailor Pluto, this is my mother, Saotome Nodoka," OnnaRanma said evenly. Nodoka bowed and wondered if Pluto knew how close she had come to getting assaulted. Pluto returned the bow and wondered how the girl had managed not to react.<p>-<p>Ranma faced Uranus in the Dojo. Sailor Moon, Sailor Saturn, Sailor Jupiter, Akane and Ukyo were along the wall, watching with interest. Nabiki stood between the two fighters.<p>"All right, full contact but no powers. You fight until one of you is unconscious or surrenders. Ready?" She raised her hand and glanced from one to the other. "Fight." She dropped her hand and walked to the wall to stand with the others.<p>There was no movement for several long moments. Uranus stood at the ready and Ranma watched, his hands behind his head. Uranus dashed forward, her fist flashing out. Ranma leaned aside and twisted slightly to avoid the other punch. He seemed to levitate for a moment as he lifted his feet to avoid a sweep, and then appeared to fold over backward, avoiding a haymaker.<p>"Wow," Ranma commented, "I didn't think anyone was slower than Akane." He continued to evade Uranus' strikes and kicks. "Ryoga could get lost between your punches. Hey, I'm gonna die of old age before you hit me at this rate." Ranma kept the insults flying, hitting more accurately with each one. Uranus got madder and madder, and as she lost her temper her swings became more forceful, but less accurate.<p>After several minutes, Akane finally got annoyed. "Ranma no baka. Quit playing with her and finish it."<p>Ranma seemed to sigh. "Oh, all right. I was just having some fun." He stopped dodging. "OK. First off, your defense is horrible." He stepped forward and brushed a punch aside. Before she could jump back, he landed a punch into her midsection the sent her flying into the wall. The Senshi stared.<p>"Only two-hundred-seventy-three hits? You're slowing down Ranma," Nabiki commented.<p>"I wanted to be sure she could take it," he replied with a casual shrug. Uranus was struggling to her feet. She snarled and charged him.<p>"Second. Never lose your temper in a fight," he said, spinning around her punch. He came up under her arm with his back against her chest. An elbow to her sternum and a pull-and-duck motion launched her over his shoulder. She crashed to the floor with a resounding thud. She was slightly slower to rise.<p>"Third. Never lose sight of your opponent. Not everyone fights fair." He rushed her before she was on her feet and she scrambled to avoid him.<p>"Fourth. Kiss." He ducked under a leap kick and swung his leg out in a sweep. Uranus landed only to have her feet taken from underneath her. "Keep It Simple, Stupid." Before she could rise, his foot came down into her abdomen, knocking the wind from her. She could only gasp for breath as he knifed a hand at her throat, halting at the last instant.<p>"You lose." Ranma straightened and walked away. Uranus rolled to her feet and charged him. He spun, not at all surprised, and blocked a one-two punch and hopped away from the kick.<p>"The fight was until one of us surrenders or is out," Uranus said. "I didn't surrender."<p>"Very good," Ranma said. He suddenly fell into a fighting stance. "Would you like to surrender now? Or do I have to beat you senseless?"<p>There was a moment of tense silence. Uranus straightened and brought her hands together as she bowed.<p>"I'll surrender, sensei."<p>-<p>Nodoka was in her element and she had her opponents on the ropes. Every argument they had laid out, she had countered. The last few arguments had been so thin and obvious that Nodoka was wondering what they were hiding. Aside from their identities. There was a reason they were resisting, but they wouldn't tell and Nodoka had been unable to lure it out.<p>Sailor Neptune and Sailor Pluto were beginning to panic. The woman was more tenacious than Galaxia had been and was using convoluted logic to defeat them. She had brought up the idea and they had tried to convince her that it was bad. She wasn't being convinced. And if even half of what she said was true, then they were doubly certain that getting Saturn together with Ranma was a <i>bad thing</i>.<p>Nodoka had paused, watching the two women across from her. Kasumi replenished their tea and laid out new crackers. Nodoka decided to play her final hand.<p>"Of course," she began, "I certainly don't intend to force them together. Nor do I expect her to reveal any secrets. I am merely suggesting that we send them on a few dates together and see what happens."<p>Neptune floundered as Nodoka suddenly seemed to reverse directions. Even Pluto was taken by surprise. Nodoka suddenly seemed to brighten, as if an idea had just occurred to her. By now, even Neptune saw through that ploy.<p>"I have thought of a way to protect your identities as well. If you have Saturn's normal parents drop her off at a prearranged time and place, then Ranma will never even need to know that he is on a date with her. And they can make further arrangements from there." Nodoka smiled brightly. Then she frowned slightly. "Though if they do decide to get married, I would expect her to wear a proper wedding gown."<p>She looked up in time to see the two Senshi picking themselves up from the floor. They glanced at each other and sighed.<p>"Very well," Pluto said. "But only one date. If they do not want to continue, we will not interfere."<p>Nodoka nodded happily. "Now what about any of the others? Are you responsible for that nice Sailor Mars? Perhaps Sailor Jupiter as well."<p>"Why not Sailor Venus?" Neptune asked, with a tilt of her head.<p>"Ranma won't need any help with that one. Or more likely, he'll need help keeping her off. Ranma isn't one to handle aggressive ladies well."<p>Pluto chuckled and shook her head. "They are on their own. Though I'm sure if you spoke to Sailor Moon, she would put in a good word."<p>-<p>A strange procession wound it's way through the streets of Nerima. Since the average Neriman is used to weird things, something that was merely strange was ignored. And all the participants in this procession were known through out Nerima anyway.<p>Cologne led the way on her staff, pogoing down the street. She was wearing formal robes and had her hair combed and held up in a topknot. Immediately behind her, Ryoga had a string around his wrist. The other end was attached to Cologne's staff. He kept his eyes firmly on the diminutive elder and ignored his surroundings. Shampoo and Moose followed. Shampoo was ecstatic and bouncing with joy. Moose was torn between scowling grimly and watching Shampoo out of the corner of his eye. Even being nearly blind didn't hide Shampoo's exuberance. Fortunately for him, Shampoo was too caught up in her daydreams to notice his ogling.<p>Shampoo was dressed to the nines. Her normal short chengosam was replaced by a knee length dress in brilliant blue. It was slit up the sides and had a panel cut out to reveal her cleavage. A glorious phoenix was embroidered on the back in gold.<p>They rounded the last corner before the Tendo Dojo. Cologne paused as she sensed the powerful auras ahead. Half a dozen girls in seifuku bounded over the walls and headed east. Their auras were overwhelming, and their departure did nothing to lessen the power concentrated in the Tendo's compound.<p>Let us walk very carefully, Great-Granddaughter, Cologne announced. There are powers at work here which we do not know.<p>Yes, Great-Grandmother.<p>As they neared the compound they saw several more women exit and drive away in a car. Ranma's mother was at the gate and noticed them approaching. She hurriedly shut the gate. Shampoo scowled until Cologne rapped her gently on the head.<p>She goes to prepare to receive us, child. She does not insult us.<p>Shampoo nodded. These Japanese customs were confusing sometimes.<p>Kasumi met them at the gate. Welcome to our home as guests, Honored Elder.<p>Eyes widened throughout the group. Cologne dropped to the ground and bowed.<p>We thank you for guesting us, Tendo no Mae. We will respect your home as our own. Cologne shot a significant glance at Shampoo.<p>This way please. Auntie Nodoka is waiting. Kasumi lead the way to the house. They removed their shoes and stepped into the waiting slippers. Nodoka was waiting at the table. Kasumi slid the door open for them and entered and closed it behind them. Ranma could be seen in the yard, chatting amiably with Ukyo, Akane and two other girls.<p>Nodoka bowed. Welcome, Honorable Elder. To pardon please, my skill of your language.<p>Cologne bowed gravely back. "There is no need. We are the guests and will speak as you do."<p>There was a pregnant pause.<p>"Great-granddaughter, take Ryoga-kun and Moose and join Ranma-kun. Saotome no Mae and I must talk."<p>"Yes, Great-grandmother."<p>The two women waited until the three youths were outside. Kasumi slid the panels shut on that side of the room. She then joined the them at the table.<p>"As Hostess, I will mediate, if necessary."<p>Cologne and Nodoka both nodded.<p>Cologne spoke first. "I suspect that you are not agreeable to Ranma and Shampoo being married."<p>"It is more that Ranma is not agreeable to the marriage," Nodoka said with a smile. "I merely support my son's choice."<p>"Yet he enjoys having multiple women chasing him."<p>"What young man would not? And it feeds his ego," Nodoka pointed out. "On the other hand, how would Ranma fare in your village?"<p>"A point, indeed," Cologne replied. "But contrary to common belief, we treat our men..."<p>"The way you and your great-granddaughter treat Moose?" Nodoka interrupted. "Ranma will not roll over and bare his throat so easily. He must be a partner, not a servant."<p>Cologne blinked, and Nodoka continued on.<p>"What do you suppose would happen the first time someone challenges Shampoo? Ranma lives to protect others. Neither Shampoo nor her opponent will be happy when he interferes. And think of the example he will set with the other men in your village. He will bring division that you can not afford."<p>Cologne held up her hand to forestall Nodoka. "I happen to agree with you. Unfortunately there is the problem of the Law and what will happen to Shampoo when she returns. And Shampoo is convinced she loves and needs him."<p>"Is there no way for the Kiss of Marriage to be reversed, Elder Cologne?" Kasumi asked, with a bit of a blush for being forward.<p>"Of course," Cologne replied. "But who is capable of defeating Shampoo in combat?"<p>"I ...," Kasumi started, only to be interrupted.<p>"Elder, come quickly," Moose called through the shougi. "Shampoo is facing The Silence Bringer."<p>-<p>Ranma looked up and groaned as he saw Shampoo, Ryoga, and Moose approaching. Ukyo adjusted her bandoleer slightly and Akane scowled.<p>"This isn't good," Ukyo noted. Akane nodded.<p>"Nihao, Airen," Shampoo called, as she went for the full body glomp. Ranma evaded it by stepping around Sailor Saturn. There were a few stares. Shampoo glanced around, taking note of people. Akane and Ukyo were standing very close, not quite touching. The blue haired girl was occupied watching the Koi. The black haired girl in the short skirt was watching her warily. There was something strange about the way she looked, but Shampoo couldn't quite focus on her features. She shrugged the feeling off, as the girl was too small and weak to be much of a threat.<p>She stepped into the center of the loose circle and twirled. "What Airen think of new dress?"<p>With typical Saotome timing and skill, Ranma muttered, "It looked better on Saturn."<p>He might as well have shouted.<p>Shampoo and Saturn turned identical shades of red, though for very different reasons. Without actually moving, the focus of the group suddenly shifted from Ranma and Shampoo to Sailor Saturn and Shampoo.<p>"Ranma!" Moose started to move and was brought to a halt as Ryoga clamped a hand on his shoulder.<p>"This is Saturn girl?" Shampoo stared at the tiny wisp in front of her. "She not look like much. Not worth even killing."<p>"I think," Saturn said softly, "that you will not find me so easy." The Silence Glaive appeared at her call.<p>Shampoo was neither surprised nor intimidated by the pole arm. "Little girl have big stick. Is very pretty toy." She turned and looked at Ranma. "You think skinny little girl look better than Shampoo?" She turned to show her profile. "She not have good hips, like Shampoo. And certainly not able to feed children." Shampoo emphasized her statement by running her hands from her hips to her breasts, pressing them together to enhance her cleavage. "What skinny girl have that Shampoo not have more of?"<p>Once again, Ranma's skill at the Saotome Secret Technique, Foot-in-Mouth, came through. "A sense of modesty?"<p>"And he's been doing so well around you, Akane," Ukyo muttered. "Must be he's only stupid for girls he's attracted to." Akane blinked and scowled at Ukyo.<p>Shampoo heard both remarks. She was beginning to get upset. Her airen was too focused on this girl. With Amazon efficiency, Shampoo moved to eliminate the competition. Unfortunately she forgot, again, that not every culture emphasizes combat skill.<p>"Skinny girl, not much of warrior. She not make for good Challenge of Marriage. How she going to have healthy babies when sooo skinny and no-chested? She not even worthy to be obstacle. Is just like fly on wall. When she bother Airen, Shampoo swat."<p>Around the group, reactions were varied. Akane and Ukyo were developing grim expressions and glaring at Shampoo. Ryoga was slightly confused, but he knew when to stay out of it. Moose had finally managed to focus on the girl in question and, perhaps because of his normally blurry vision, identified her place in Amazon legend.<p>Ranma was getting angry. Shampoo was insulting and threatening a guest in his house (the idea that he was attracted to her hadn't occurred to him yet). It was as if his own honor was being attacked. It had nothing to do with the fact that a cute, and apparently defenseless, girl was being put down. He started to step forward.<p>Sailor Saturn was simply enduring the meaningless abuse. She had heard worse, and faced more dangerous opponents. She would be around long after this girls descendants were dust, so there was no point in getting angry. Her pride could handle the assault. She was, after all, Sailor Saturn, the dreaded Silence Bringer. On the other hand, she couldn't let Ranma answer this challenge for her. She stepped forward, moving in front of him as he tensed.<p>"You should be careful, child," Saturn said. She managed exactly the right condescending tone, proving that living with Pluto and Neptune was educational. "You have misjudged me and insulted me without even knowing who I am. And now we shall see if you can chew what you have bitten off."<p>She paused as Moose suddenly groaned and went running for the house.<p>"I am the Senshi Saturn, the Silence Bringer. You have been insulting and rude, though a guest in another home. I will not tolerate your childish ways any longer. In the name of Saturn and the Moon, I will punish you." She leveled the Glaive at Shampoo.<p>Shampoo stared incredulously. Then she giggled. "Skinny girl going to punish Shampoo? This be too, too fun." She produced her bon bori. "No worry, Airen. Shampoo not hurt her, much."<p>"Wait!" Cologne arrived with Nodoka, Kasumi and Moose in tow. She looked around the group. "Kuonji-san, what has happened?"<p>Ukyo blinked, surprised at being asked, but explained what had happened. Cologne stared at Sailor Saturn the whole time, making her fidget. When Ukyo finished, the old woman turned to Shampoo.<p>"Well it seems that the idiocy that killed your mother has bred true. I don't know how else you could have been so stupid as to insult a Goddess. And to have done it in your supposed airen's presence and home. Your honor is forever stained among the tribe, even if you survive. And Ranma will never marry you." She turned and faced Saturn. "Please, Megami-sama, do not slay her. This foolish descendant of mine does not know the tribal lore as she should."<p>Saturn blushed, stammering a denial.<p>"This Combat of Marriage will begin then," Cologne continued. "If Saturn-sama wins, Shampoo will no longer pursue Ranma according to our laws."<p>"What if Shampoo win?"<p>The look Cologne leveled at her made Shampoo quail. "Should you win, you may continue as you have. Fight until first blood, or knockout." She looked from one to the other of the combatants.<p>"Wait," Ranma interjected. Before any one could object he grabbed Saturn and dragged her around the house. "We'll be right back."<p>"What's the matter, Ranma-San?"<p>Ranma was pacing rapidly back and forth. "You don't know how to fight." It was a statement.<p>Saturn blushed. "I've managed against the Youma."<p>"This isn't a Youma," Ranma managed to keep his voice level. "She isn't evil or a creature of Darkness. You can't just blast her into nothingness."<p>Saturn lowered her head.<p>"Awww, man," Ranma groaned. "Don't cry. I didn't bring you over here to make you cry. C'mon, it'll be OK." He was waving his arms and hopping from foot to foot.<p>Saturn couldn't help but smile at Ranma's antics. When he saw her smile he froze in mid-gesture and stared, blushing slightly. Saturn blushed even more under his scrutiny.<p>"Ah. Heh heh. Sorry 'bout that," Ranma stammered, his hand behind his head as he looked away.<p>"What can I do, Ranma-San? If she's better than me, I'll look really stupid after I said all that stuff."<p>"She's not better than you. She has more experience in duels, but you would be able to beat her easily if you knew what you did in the Moon Kingdom."<p>Saturn shook her head. "We don't have our memories of the Moon Kingdom the way you all seem to."<p>Ranma had paused and looked at her, measuring her height. He grinned and winked at her. "At least my curse hasn't bothered..." He trailed off as the gutter along the roof suddenly cracked, dumping water on him.<p>Saturn watched the transformation. She was a bit surprised by her own reaction to the idea of man who could also be a woman. She idly wondered if there was emotional leakage between his forms.<p>"OK." OnnaRanma's voice brought her back to reality. The shorter girl stepped behind Saturn. OnnaRanma was just tall enough to look over Saturn's shoulder. She pulled Saturn up against her, so their feet were overlapped, and placed her hands over Saturn's on the Silence Glaive.<p>"Now, just let me lead for a moment. You should remember things pretty quickly," OnnaRanma said in her ear. "I think."<p>It took Saturn a moment to focus past the sensation of OnnaRanma shifting against her back and along her arms. But when she finally did, something clicked. A wash of deja vu swept her into memories. <i>Memories of doing this same thing with another redhead. Of flirting and teasing, and a bit of heart ache. Her first crush and one of the only people who treated her normally. The diminutive woman who wasn't afraid to face the Silence Glaive in the sparring room, and her parting words, after their last match. "Remember, it's not a tool or a weapon, but the focus of your soul. Wield it as a part of your arm, the way a painter does his brush. Pour your soul into your art, and you will never fail to create a work of beauty."</i><p> Her memory came to a darker time. The final assault of Beryl. And then she knew. Then she had danced among the Youma, pouring her soul into her art, the art of Silence.<p>Saturn snapped her eyes open. OnnaRanma was standing several meters in front of her with a look of profound awe and joy on her face. She smiled as she saw that Saturn was done with her recalling. And her dance.<p>"Thank you, Ranma-San," Saturn said.<p>"Ah. Sure." She obviously didn't know exactly what she had done. She blushed and stammered when Saturn leaned over and kissed her cheek.<p>"Let us go and finish this," Saturn said confidently. And as she walked away, OnnaRanma couldn't help but notice the change in her gait. She moved like a dancer or a fighter would, a far cry from the timid walk she had before. OnnaRanma grinned. The Silence Bringer was back.<p>Cologne noticed the change instantly. She prostrated herself in front of Saturn, kow towing and pleading for Shampoo's life. Shampoo noticed the difference as well and began to worry, especially since she couldn't remember where she had heard the term 'Silence Bringer.'<p>"I will not kill, Honored Elder," Saturn said gently. "The final Silence is for creatures of Darkness."<p>She faced Shampoo, as the others fell back and formed a large circle. She held the Silence Glaive out to the side, parallel to the ground, it's haft along her arm. She flexed her knees slightly and held out her other hand toward Shampoo. She crooked her finger, beckoning the Amazon girl.<p>"Let us Dance, Child of the Asteroids."<p>****<p>The Queen of the Moon Kingdom let her face drop into her hands so she wouldn't have to see the disaster unfold. The fact that she had been warned, didn't help.<p>"I told you," the red-haired harbinger of disaster announced smugly.<p>Serenity slumped further. If Féadel had explained it, she would have been fine with the idea, but Mordaé had brought problem to her attention. Mordaé seemed to get an unhealthy glee from pointing out Serenity's mistakes and short comings.<p>Pluto glowered. She felt that the little harridan was far too disrespectful. Unfortunately, Serenity tolerated the little tramp, which meant Pluto had to as well. And now she was worming her way in to becoming the trainer for the young Senshi.<p>"Your Majesty," Pluto said, "this proves nothing. They were placed in a situation where they could not win."<p>"Pluto," Mordaé said softly.<p>"What?"<p>"The actual scenario hadn't begun. These were the warm up exercises. They only made it through round one." Mordaé glanced down at the six girls in the training room. "They need to be brought up to speed, or Serenity will never be safe. Saturn is progressing rapidly, and I can do the same with the others."<p>"There is a problem, Mordaé," Serenity said. "If I place the Senshi under your training, there are those who will claim that you are corrupting them and turning them against the Kingdom. You <i>do</i> have your own agendas and have admitted to such. The enemies you have made among my Court will not trust you."<p>"Feh. Beryl and her camp aren't powerful enough to do anything yet. The Senshi will have plenty of opportunities to prove their loyalty and worth. But only if they live long enough."<p>Serenity interrupted. "I know you don't like Lady Beryl and I've heard your accusations. But we cannot accuse or arrest her without more proof than your word. And I still forbid you to take any action against her."<p>"All I'm saying," Mordaé stated patiently, "is that you don't have to listen to some two-bit, wanna-be from Earth, simply because she's caught the eye of a few courtiers. The Court doesn't need to know who's training your daughter's Senshi, and without Tranquility's Senshi to provide competition, they're getting soft. They won't be able to handle their trials if you don't do something."<p>Serenity sighed. She looked down into the training room again. Mars and Jupiter were teamed up and shouting at Uranus and Venus. Mercury was huddled in a corner, her vacant gaze indicating that she was interfacing with the Computer. Neptune was preening with her Mirror.<p>"You have one week. If they don't show marked improvement, then something else will have to be done."<p>Mordaé snickered. "Like grounding them?"<p>Six girls stood in a line and warily watched the woman in front of them. They had been told she would be training them for the next week. They had all heard the stories about Mordaé, and if only half of them were believed, they were in trouble. They all wondered why Queen Serenity was willing to trust a group of twelve year old girls to a woman with Mordaé's reputation and supposed inclinations.<p>They watched nervously as she paced back and forth. She paused to look each of them over carefully. They could almost feel her undressing them with her eyes. After several eternal minutes, she completed her examination and turned to face the two Princesses.<p>"Not a thing I can do, Serenity," Mordaé drawled. "You'll have to find some new Senshi. These haven't got what it takes. Although if Tranquility-hime's Senshi were still around, they could take up the slack." She grinned as she heard murmurs of protest from behind.<p>"Was there a problem, girls?" She spun and glared at the Senshi. Most of them looked at their toes, or examined the ceiling. Mars was the first to speak.<p>"We have what it takes. We can do anything the other Senshi could do." She was slightly taller than Mordaé and leaned forward slightly to yell in the redhead's face. Mordaé grinned wider, showing sharp incisors.<p>"Any others think they have what it takes?"<p>A moment of silence was broken by Uranus and Jupiter stepping forward to join Mars. "Yes," they declared, defiantly. Mercury and Neptune stepped forward as well, dragging Venus between them.<p>"Good. For the next week, I'll be your instructor. Classes in the morning, physical training in the afternoon. Not including the five kilometer run before breakfast, or the ten kilometer run after dinner. There will be fifteen minutes between wake up and roll call for you to get ready. That includes making your bed as well as getting cleaned up. After dinner there will be a half hour to do your homework, before lights out. You will eat together, sleep together, and train together, twenty-four-seven."<p>There was a stunned silence as the girls stared. "But.." Some of them started to protest.<p>Mordaé cut them off with a wave. "I'm going to be hard on you. You'll probably hate me, but I can live with that. Because when I'm done training you, you <i>will</i> be able to do anything the Elder Senshi could have done."<p>Mercury timidly raised a hand. "S-S-Sensei?"<p>Mordaé glanced at the girl. "Yes, all the stories you've heard are true. Except one. I never, ever force my attentions on someone who doesn't want them, or on little girls. I may flirt and tease, but I never touch." Her expression softened for a moment. "I like making people feel good, not hurting them. And everybody wants to be wanted, even if only by a hyperactive, lesbian nymphomaniac." She suddenly grinned again, her wistfulness disappearing. "Now lets go. Five kilometer jog. You too, Princesses."<p>-<p>"You think she's lonely?" Mars stared at her Princess. "How can she be lonely? She flirts with every female she meets and fondles any that are old enough to be groped. Half the maids hate her and the other half keep hoping that they'll be her next fling."<p>Venus joined in with Mars. "She sneaks in to the women's bath all the time wearing a towel around her head. She told me it was a 'peeping disguise.' That woman is loonier than a barrel of monkeys."<p>Serenity shook her head. "She doesn't have any friends. Except Tranquility. No one likes her for just her."<p>"Of course not," Mars exclaimed. "She drives away everyone who could be her friend. She's got an abrasive personality and a rude sense of humor. And she goes after anything in a skirt."<p>Jupiter chimed in. "I saw her grope Pluto the other day."<p>There was a moment of silence.<p>"How the heck did she survive?" Uranus demanded.<p>"Pluto just glared at her and asked if she <i>had</i> to do that. Sensei laughed, like she usually does, and told Pluto yes. Pluto walked away mumbling."<p>"All of this just proves my point," Serenity insisted. "She is really a sweet and caring person, but she doesn't know how to show it. She sits in our room all night, watching over Tranquility. I saw her once, when she thought I was asleep. She pulled the blankets up and straightened them around Tranquility."<p>"Probably trying to get a look down your sister's nightie." Venus snorted derisively. The crack of flesh striking flesh caught the attention of all the Senshi. Venus stared in astonishment at Saturn, one hand to her bruising cheek.<p>"Sensei would never do that," Saturn declared. "Serenity-hime is right. Sensei has no other friends, though I hope she thinks of me as her friend."<p>Venus suddenly leaned forward, grinning slyly at Saturn. "You've got a crush on Sensei," she sing-songed.<p>The others gasped as Saturn blushed, confirming Venus' accusation.<p>"It hardly matters if I do," Saturn said calmly. "Sensei is in love with someone else."<p>"Oooo," Venus said. "Who is it?"<p>Saturn looked away with a derisive snort.<p>"It's Féadel," Serenity exclaimed. "That must be why they're never together. She's too shy to tell him."<p>"But Serenity-hime," Mercury protested, "Mordaé sensei claims to only like women."<p>Serenity waved the statement away. "That's only so she won't have every man in court chasing her. Now we have to come up with a plan to get them alone together, so she can admit her love for him."<p>"That is the stupidest idea you've come up with yet, Su-chan," Tranquility said suddenly.<p>Serenity leaped nearly half a meter in the air with a shriek. "W-w-when did you get here, Q-chan?"<p>Tranquility ignored her sister. "If sensei were to find that you all have energy for silly plots like this, you all know what she will do. So don't even think about it."<p>With her usual tact, Venus said, "We'll just have to make sure you don't know what we're doing. Out of sight, Zen no mind after all."<p>Tranquility rolled her eyes. "I'll find out, V-chan." And she tilted her head at Serenity. Venus blinked for a moment until Mars grabbed her arm and rapped her on the head. The Senshi all sighed in echo of their Princess and went back to their pre-bedtime studies.<p>FIN.
