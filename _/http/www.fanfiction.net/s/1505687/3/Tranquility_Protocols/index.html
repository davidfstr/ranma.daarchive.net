</div>            Author's Note: I do not own Sailor Moon or Ranma 1/2. All characters are copyright by their owners. I am using them without permission or profit. (MegaTokyo is created by Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston. See the online comic at .com.) All original characters are mine. Also, those who know her refer to Tranquility with the suffix '-hime' (princess) where Serenity is often not accorded the honorific. Languages- "Japanese", Chinese, _Panda Signs_, -Senshi Velocity-, [Others] (as indicated).<p>Tranquility Protocols Chapter 3<p>Saotome Nodoka slipped into her room and opened the storage closet. She reached up to the upper shelf and carefully lifted down a box. It was as long as her forearm and half that wide. She set it on the floor and knelt next to it. She set the Saotome Blade down next to her and drew a packet from her kimono. Setting the packet down, she opened the lid of the box and reached in to lift out two books.<p>The first book was thick and filled with scraps of paper and pictures. Bits of newspaper, computer printouts, even scanned and printed photos overflowed the binding of the scrap book. Many more papers were stuffed in envelopes and taped in the back. The book was simply labeled "Inners."<p>The second book was much thinner. It had the same capacity as the first, but had much less information in it. There were no papers protruding and every one of the few pictures fit neatly into the book. There were no extra pictures or envelopes, and the book was labeled "Outers."<p>Nodoka opened the small packet and looked at the five pictures it contained. Two of them had been taken with her own camera. The other three she had downloaded and printed from the .org mailing list. All of the pics were somewhat grainy and blurred. But the colors were clear and the subjects were easily recognized as Senshi.<p>The first two pictures were of the Senshi that had saved Nodoka at the park. The Senshi wore the normal white body suit. She had a dark purple skirt and black boots and bows. Her hair, dark and bluish, was cut in a short pageboy style. Her boots and gloves were long. One of the pictures included three familiar Senshi, but Nodoka had enough images of them. She set the pictures aside and looked at the printed photos.<p>They had been taken in Juban where Senshi were common, but these were as unfamiliar as the one she had seen in Nerima. Only one of the two new Senshi actually looked like a Senshi. She had brilliantly colored skirts and bows that were reminiscent of a sunrise. Her hair was brilliant red, matching her boots, and cut boyishly short.<p>The other Senshi depicted was unlike any of the others Nodoka had seen. She had no bows and her body suit was gray rather than white. She was wearing a thick leather apron and she held a large gun of some sort. Her hair was dull red, as if soot covered, and pinned close. Her boots and gloves were smoke stained and scarred with burns.<p>All that was known of these three new Senshi was that two of them had used powers that could include their names. Nike and Aurora. She had heard Senshi Nike call out "Nike Victory Lance." Some of the other things Nike had done had seemed familiar. The way she moved and the way she fought were familiar to Nodoka, but she couldn't quite place the style.<p>All of the information on the other two had come from those who had seen them in action and posted the details. Aurora seemed to use light. Her attack was different from the attacks of Sailor Venus and was said to be much more powerful. Some of the witnesses said that the second Senshi had blasted Aurora with a huge laser beam. Nodoka agreed with those who thought that the unknown Senshi was powering up her companion.<p>She took the pictures and opened the book she kept for the mysterious "Outers." There was plenty of space in the back for these new pictures. She carefully labeled them and added the chat and e-mail postings concerning the three. She had a feeling that she would be seeing more of these strange new Senshi.<p>-<p>The place was not a real place as such. There were no dimensions or time. There was nothing but blackness. Yet there were variations in the Darkness. And one such variation took on length and depth. It expanded and gained form. And because there was no room in the Darkness for something with form and dimension, the variation was expelled. For a moment a burst of light broke through, though not so much 'light' as a less dark spot. The darkness quickly flowed over the lesser darkness, smothering and engulfing it.<p>The newly formed piece of darkness slowly gained awareness of its surroundings. It began to realize that it was different from those before it. It had greater power and greater purpose. There was light all around it and it had the power to do something about that light. It reached out and began to feed.<p>-<p>Professor Yamagutchi looked up as the tone of the particle accelerator shifted. Numbers began to change on the computer screens in front of him. The machine was undergoing a standard power up to maintain its circuits. It shouldn't be having any fluctuations. He began to type commands into the main computer control. He didn't see the patch of blackness that crept across the wall to engulf his shadow. The process of light draining from him was subtle and slow, leaving no mark or pain. Someone who looked into his eyes carefully may have noticed a lack. But it would be difficult for anyone to say what was missing.<p>His wife noticed. But she had no chance to do anything about it. He violently took her on the dining room table, ignoring her screams and the screams of his children. Her light was devoured and the darkness spread. The children weren't spared, their light extinguished in violent acts of degradation and abuse. The creature of Darkness began to plan.<p>-<p>"Setsuna-mama, what the hell is going on?" Hotaru was more than just mildly upset now. She glared impartially at anyone near by as well as her guardian and Yoshimi. The latter was blissfully unaware of the looks directed at her as she slept in the back seat of the car. "She's going to kill me?"<p>"Of course not, Hotaru-chan." Setsuna didn't sound as sure as her blithe reassurance. "If they were here to do that then they would have appeared last year when you were possessed by Mistress 9. They have another purpose."<p>"They?" Hotaru's voice shot up an octave. "How many are there?"<p>"Just seven. We mentioned that."<p>"Seven Senshi as powerful as her trying to kill me? And you're just now telling me this?"<p>Setsuna glanced at Hotaru. She wasn't nearly as hysterical as she sounded. But she was frightened.<p>"Well they aren't all as powerful as Yoshimi. And they probably aren't trying to kill you. But some of them can be rather impetuous. They tend to jump to conclusions based on vague evidence and then act without proper planning."<p>Hotaru looked skeptical. "So you're saying that who ever advises them tends to keep things to herself, give them cryptic bits of information that aren't complete and expects them to handle situations for which they are unprepared? And then they leap in feet first with powers flying . Sounds familiar."<p>"Are you implying something, Hotaru-chan?"<p>"What could I possibly be implying, Setsuna-mama?" Hotaru's tone exactly matched Setsuna's. Their glares met for a long moment then Setsuna sighed and looked away.<p>"I do what I have to, Hotaru. I do the best I can with the limitations I have."<p>Hotaru nodded. "I probably shouldn't have said..."<p>"To an extent you're right though," Setsuna interrupted. "And I was being unfair to Tranquility-hime and her Senshi. They were only active briefly when they first bonded with Tranquility-hime, but they displayed a level of team work that surpassed anything the Moon Kingdom had seen. The seven of them, newly awoken and untrained, faced the Elder Senshi, seven on seven. Odds were twelve to one against them, or worse."<p>"Seven? Saturn and Pluto weren't there?"<p>"No. I was busy, but Saturn was there. There were only eight Senshi then. No Sailor Moon."<p>"Let me guess," Hotaru said with a smirk. "Tranquility's Senshi won."<p>"They skunked the Queen's Senshi. Twenty-seven to zero. Not easy to do in zero-g soccer. Now imagine what they would do against our current friends."<p>Hotaru thought for a moment and then began to giggle. "I can't imagine Usagi playing soccer."<p>Setsuna smiled "Feel better now?"<p>Hotaru nodded, still smiling a little. "I almost wish I hadn't found out. Having a Sword of Damocles hanging over me isn't very comfortable."<p>Setsuna nodded. "Speaking of swords. It looks like Haruka and Michiru are home and sharpening the knives."<p>Hotaru's grin became a bit vicious. She smoothed the front of her dress and adjusted the hem. A quick glance in the vanity mirror showed that her make-up was still in good shape. She smiled sweetly at Setsuna, who rolled her eyes. The two women in question were waiting at the head of the driveway as Setsuna pulled the car into place. Hotaru was about to exit the car when Yoshimi sat up in the back. Hotaru's smile became a smirk.<p>"Yoshimi-chan." Hotaru's voice was sugary. "Ariel and Uriel are here and waiting to see you."<p>She had hardly finished speaking when the car door slammed shut in the wake of Yoshimi's passing. Michiru and Haruka were taken completely by surprise in an impressive double glomp. Hotaru exited the car and strutted past her helpless parental figures.<p>"Setsuna's sister, Yoshimi, the Senshi Velocity, dropped by while you were out." Honey couldn't have been sweeter than Hotaru's tone. "She will be happy to explain the situation to you. Setsuna can tell you anything she misses."<p>As she turned to enter the house, there was a hideous bellow and the sound of wood and glass breaking. The thing of Darkness smashed through the wall of the adjacent house leaving faint screams behind. It rushed toward the five women with a snarl.<p>"Senshi. Die."<p>Haruka was probably the fastest of the Senshi. Setsuna, with her peculiar powers, often seemed to react instantly. Michiru, herself, was no slouch when it came to quickness and reactions. Before any of them had done more than thought about changing, Senshi Velocity was there.<p>"-Hardly likely-," Velocity said, as she slammed a few hundred casual punches into the shadow. "-No Senshi are going to die while I'm here.-"<p>She had reverted to her sport top and shorts combo with silvery bracers and running shoes. Her braid seemed to flow with a life of it's own, twining and twisting through the air behind her. She seemed to flicker around the shadow, punching and kicking. Each hit turned a bit of the creature to smoke and she was hitting it a lot.<p>Suddenly the Darkling got a lucky swing, more from random flailing than intent, and Velocity was knocked through a wall with a delicate 'oof'. The Darkling turned to face the others, who hadn't had time to even change. Haruka barely had time to open her mouth before the thing swatted her aside. Michiru wisely ducked behind one of the cars, but couldn't transform. Setsuna didn't even try. She merely grabbed Hotaru and ran toward the house. The Darkling was turning toward them when an explosion from behind attracted it's attention.<p>Velocity was standing in the hole she had made on her first passage. The wall was all that remained of the house. There was a shallow scratch across her midriff and she was breathing deep. There was a faint glow around her and bits and pieces debris were drifting in lazy orbits. She brushed a drop of blood away from the corner of her mouth and glanced at her hand. Seeing the bit of red, her eyes narrowed.<p>"-Now, I'm mad,-" she snarled.<p>"Oh <b>shit</b>," Setsuna breathed. She raised her voice and yelled, "Duck and cover." Suiting actions to words, she threw herself down behind the meager shelter of the shrubbery along the walk, covering and pinning Hotaru beneath her. Michiru scrambled to help Haruka take cover between the garage and the neighboring fence. Hotaru, on her back beneath Setsuna, had a clear view of Velocity's attack.<p>Senshi Velocity had been playing before. Now she was serious. Afterimages trailed behind her as she ran toward the Darkling, faster than the eye could follow. She was completing her attack before her voice even reached the ears of those nearby. Four images seemed to solidify and charge in. At the last second, all four launched kicks, two aiming high and two aiming low. There followed a hail of punches from all directions, seemingly at once. And finally she came to rest, the images disappearing one by one, and raised her hand as if reaching to pull down the sky.<p>"-Kick of Four Winds.-" Her voice caught up. "-Thousand Fist Rain.-" There was a moment of silence.<p>"-Hyper Velocity final attack!-" She brought her hand down in a slashing motion until her finger pointed at the Darkling. "-Meteor Storm.-" A small hole seemed to open directly above the Darkling. A speck of white hot energy slammed through, passing though the Darkling as if it wasn't there. A second followed and a third. The shock wave from the first impact washed outward as the fourth micro-meteor arrived and a fifth followed before the hole closed.<p>Windows shattered for nearly a mile around. Michiru's car was picked up and tossed into Haruka's. Houses shook and rattled and trees and plants were uprooted. Alarms wailed and screams and cries were heard. Sirens sounded in the distance. The Darkling was gone leaving a shallow, three foot wide crater in it's place.<p>Senshi Velocity dusted her hands with a smile, turned and took two steps toward Setsuna before collapsing. Setsuna sighed and with a shake of her head went to carry her sister inside. Hotaru helped, while Haruka and Michiru straggled in their wake, leaning heavily on each other.<p>They glanced at each other in unified concern. There was little they could do to defend Hotaru against that sort of power.<p>"You'd think she'd learn not to strain her powers so soon after waking up," Setsuna muttered. "And without a proper breakfast either."<p>***<p>Princess Tranquility sighed in annoyance. The seven girls in front of her hung their heads in varying levels of embarrassment and shame. On the other side of the room her mother's Senshi stood and glared. Queen Serenity was talking sternly with Senshi Uranus, who didn't look at all chastened or repentant. The only good thing about the whole situation, as far as Tranquility was concerned, was that Mordaé was gone and couldn't have been involved.<p>"Exactly whose idea was this?" The dark haired princess carefully looked at her newly bonded Senshi. They fidgeted and looked away.<p>"Well, I kind of thought," Minerva began.<p>"It's because I," Nike said at the same moment. Each of the others had started to speak as well. They all broke off together.<p>Tranquility snickered. "No time to get your story straight? All right. At least you're showing some initiative and teamwork." Tranquility shot a glance at her sister who was comparing dolls with the younger Senshi of Venus. Mars and Neptune were restraining Jupiter and Uranus from tearing into each other. Mercury was busy scribbling some sort of equation on the wall with a crayon while Saturn watched. Tranquility was glad <i>her</i> Senshi were older rather than younger. Baby-sitting a bunch of eight year olds wasn't how she wanted to spend her days. On the other hand, eighteen was probably a bit old to be friends with a ten year old. But Tranquility had always been serious and mature for her age.<p>"Her Majesty won't unbind us will she?" Harmony's voice trembled slightly.<p>"She can't do that," a masculine voice responded. "You are all necessary to fulfill the Prophecy."<p>Eight pairs of eyes snapped to the face of the handsomest man in the Court (at least they each thought so.)<p>"Féadel-sama," Tranquility and each of her Senshi sighed.<p>Féadel filled in for Mordaé when she had other business. He was tall and lean, but well muscled. He had slightly slanted eyes and sharp, flaring ears. His nose was curved and softened the overall sharpness of his face. His chin was firm without jutting or taking up too much of his face. His mouth was strong and mobile, able to indicated his feelings with a simple twitch. Smoky black hair was held back in a tail by a golden ring. He had sharp incisors and just a hint of tiny horns at his hairline. His skin was as dark as Pluto's, but he claimed there was no relation. He wore a simple black jumpsuit and held an unadorned staff.<p>"However that does not excuse your actions." His voice was low, but not rumbling. There was no menace in his tone, just a level bluntness. "Serenity-sama is discussing the situation with her Senshi. Why don't you tell me what happened and why. I may be able to help you if you are honest and repentant."<p>Minerva glanced around and stepped forward. "We were paying them back for something they said about Tranquility-hime. It kind of got out of hand."<p>Féadel smiled, sending most of the girls into love-struck fantasies. "Things have a tendency to do that. Begin at the beginning."<p>Minerva stood straight and put her hands behind her back. The others emulated her forming a wall of serious looking young ladies.<p>"It began when Aurora came and told me that she had overheard Uranus talking about Tranquility-hime. Uranus made a rather unfavorable comparison. We obviously couldn't let that sort of thing slide, so we made plans to pay her back."<p>Féadel sighed. Ever since Nike had beaten the younger Uranus, her sister, the older Uranus, had been stirring up discontent toward Princess Tranquility. Some of the others, especially those who had encountered the princess' sharp tongue, were siding with her. Mercury was the only Elder Senshi who actually liked the girl.<p>"What exactly did she say?"<p>Aurora turned bright pink and several of the others clenched fists or gritted their teeth. Minerva glanced at her princess and then leaned forward and whispered in Féadel's ear. An ear twitched violently and one eye brow rose as he listened intently. When she leaned back, he turned and met Uranus' gaze. She turned very pale and stepped behind Queen Serenity.<p>He turned back. "All right. I can see why you reacted the way you did. But you should have brought this to the attention of Mordaé or myself, or even the Queen. You definitely should not have been responsible for five of the Elder Senshi streaking through the throne room during the High Audience."<p>"But Féadel-sama," Nike protested. "We're her Senshi. It's our job to protect her and fight for her."<p>Féadel smiled at her outrage. "Actually, Nike-chan, it's my job to protect her. And Mordaé's when she's here instead. Your job is to obey her and fulfill the Prophecy. However..."<p>He broke off as Queen Serenity gently cleared her throat at his shoulder. She met his gaze until he nodded once. He looked away and the Senshi caught his annoyed expression. The Queen cleared her throat again, recapturing their attention.<p>"This sort of behavior cannot go unpunished. If I allow Senshi to behave this way then others will feel they need not obey laws." Queen Serenity was well trained as a Judge, so no hint of her feelings on the matter leaked through in her voice, but the look she directed at Féadel's back wasn't nearly so impartial.<p>Féadel suddenly turned. "They broke no Laws. If you feel a punishment is necessary, I have a suggestion."<p>Queen Serenity met Féadel's gaze with a raised eyebrow.<p>-<p>"A soccer match?" Minerva was as surprised as the rest of them.<p>"Yes. You seven against the Elder Senshi. Pluto excluded." Féadel seemed smug. His expression soured a bit. "Unfortunately I think Serenity is going to use this as an excuse to return you all to inactive status."<p>"But..." Eight voices raised in protest.<p>Féadel held up his hand, interrupting them. "I spoke with her about it. She will also be retiring the Elder Senshi soon. And, for the next few years, they will be assigned under the command of myself or Mordaé. All that remains is for you all to prove that they need training."<p>"How are we supposed to do that?" Vulcan was skeptical.<p>"By winning. You shouldn't have any problems. Just remember that you can't use your powers to affect the other team." Féadel's smile was rather nasty. The seven young ladies matched his grin and then huddled together to begin planning. He turned and headed for the door, glancing down as Tranquility joined him. They came to a halt just outside the door as they found the Elder Senshi waiting.<p>Mars and Uranus headed up the group. Directly behind them, Venus, Jupiter, and Neptune formed a supporting wall. Mercury was in the very back, looking apologetic. Next to her, Saturn was as impassive as always.<p>"What the hell are you pulling?" Uranus demanded. "Why do we have to play against those brats?"<p>"Senshi Uranus," Tranquility snapped. Féadel placed a hand on her shoulder, calming her.<p>Uranus glanced down at the girl. "You should keep your sluts in lin..."<p>She was interrupted as Tranquility made a tugging gesture. To her immense surprise, Uranus found herself pulled down to Tranquility's level. The girl reached out and slapped the Elder Senshi. The others stared in surprise as Uranus, one of the strongest of them, reeled back from the blow. Neptune and Jupiter caught her and helped her to her feet. She stepped forward again raising a fist, and was halted. The sharply pointed end of Féadel's staff rested against the hollow of her throat.<p>"Don't." He spoke only one word, but all of the Elder Senshi stepped back. Without taking his eyes from Uranus' he spoke to Tranquility. "Your Highness?"<p>"Since she is guilty of slander and Treason," Tranquility began. "I should probably have her put to death. Mother would agree, considering her insults and this attempt to physically attack me."<p>Uranus suddenly went very white, wondering if she had stepped too far. Her eyes remained locked with Féadel's but now she was sweating in fear. Tranquility had one finger against her cheek as if contemplating.<p>"Your Highness?" Mercury was timid. "The soccer match next week would be delayed if we had to train a new Senshi."<p>"Of course! Thank you for reminding me Senshi Mercury. I will deal with Senshi Uranus after the match then. Besides, Mordaé should be back by then. I'm sure she'll have plenty of suggestions." She dismissed them with a wave. As they headed down the hall, she suddenly called out, "Uranus, don't ever forget that I <i>am</i> your princess, regardless of who will inherit the Throne."<p>****<p>Ranma grinned at the sight of Ukyo and Akane snuggled together. His ideas for waking them had all been vetoed by Nike, so he settled for clearing his throat gently. Both girls made sleepy noises of protest and snuggled closer, their hands wandering. Ranma carefully repressed his laughter at the sight of Akane and Ukyo's expressions as they realized just who was touching whom, and where.<p>They sat up and jerked apart, saved from a fall by Ranma, who caught them both at the waist and braced them until they got their feet. They stared at each other and Ranma, who was smart enough to keep his expression neutral.<p>"Kasumi has breakfast ready. And we need to get ready for school." Ranma was as tactful as he could be.<p>Akane and Ukyo stared at him for a moment.<p>"Who are you and what have you done with Ranchan?" Ukyo quipped.<p>"Hey!"<p>Akane snickered for a moment then sobered up. "We need to talk Ranma."<p>Ukyo nodded and sat down pulling Akane down beside her. Ranma knelt across from them, an expectant look on his face.<p>"Um... " Akane began.<p>"It's over isn't it?" Ranma was a bit wistful. "I'm not sure I'll know what to do with out you guys chasing me and calling me names when I put my foot in it."<p>Akane sighed. "I care about you Ranma. And you care for me. But this whole past life thing..." She trailed off.<p>"It's always been about honor for me, Ranchan. Of course I like you a lot, but now Aura and 'Phes are waking in us." Ukyo sounded as wistful as Ranma.<p>Ranma nodded understanding. "I think it's different for me and Nike, 'cause of the Jusenkyo curse. But I know you two will be good together again."<p>"We'll have to maintain appearances. Otherwise..." Akane grimaced at the need. "Why can't we just be left alone?"<p>"Shampoo will be pressing her suit if she finds out Ranchan." Ukyo still had a bit of jealousy in her voice.<p>Ranma grinned at his two friends and fellow Senshi. "I can handle Shampoo. But for us?" He held out a hand. "Friends?"<p>"Friends," Ukyo agreed, clasping his hand. Akane added hers.<p>"Sisters, and friends," she declared.<p>"Great. Let's go eat."<p>They all laughed at Ranma's enthusiasm. Ranma paused as the others dropped from the roof. He looked around, but saw nothing. His stomach rumbled, distracting him and he followed the other two.<p>-<p>Under the eaves, a small cat tied to sort out what it had just heard. If Ranma was 'just friends' with the other two, then that left her as the only competitor. She rushed to tell her Elder the wonderful news.<p>-<p>Nodoka looked up at the roof of the Tendo home. She hadn't heard all of the conversation, but she had heard enough. Perhaps Ranma was finally growing up. Or maybe he was getting tired of the pressure. Either way, she decided to support him. Especially if the young chef was making a play for Akane. Nodoka had never been quite clear on the situation with Ukyo. But if Ranma was willing to let Akane go to the other then there must be a good reason. Nodoka knew that Ranma would never 'loose' Akane unless he was sure she would be taken care of.<p>She entered the house, calling out a greeting. She was surprised when Ukyo and Akane came thundering around the corner, dragging Ranma between them. They dropped the hapless boy in surprise and bowed.<p>"Good morning, Auntie Nodoka," they chorused in unison. Akane glanced back at Ranma. "Hurry up, baka. We're late."<p>Ranma seemed to ignore her and she fumed as he turned to his mother and bowed.<p>"Don't waste time on formalities, Ranma dear," Nodoka said in amusement.<p>"Ah, the kawaiikune tomboy's exaggerating," he drawled. He carefully hugged her. "Later, momma."<p>"Ranma." Nodoka's voice brought all three up short. "It is very impolite to call your <i>friends</i> names. Outside of a match that is." She smiled at them all. "Run along children. Don't be late."<p>She watched as they ran out the gates. Now then, who would be a good replacement? Maybe one of the Senshi? Kasumi would be helpful in figuring something out. Nodoka went in to help Kasumi clean up and make morning tea. Then they could discuss the future of her son, something she never tired of.<p>-<p>"She knows," Ranma said to the others as they ran for school.<p>"About the Senshi?"<p>"Nah, but she knows we've reached an understanding about the engagement. Which means she'll be setting me up with every girl she can find now."<p>"At least she's not likely to engage you to three or four before we get back from school," Ukyo said.<p>"You don't know Auntie Nodoka," Akane responded.<p>"Yeah," Ranma agreed. "Betcha there'll be three or four omai this evening."<p>They all sighed in irritation, not even noticing Kuno as they trampled over him. They slipped into class just ahead of the teacher who glared at them in annoyance, but said nothing. The morning passed quietly and by lunch all three of them were getting jumpy. Something was about to happen. Something strange, which was to be expected in Nerima.<p>It began at lunch. Those who knew Ranma well were jumping at every little sound. Nabiki had closed all betting pools on Ranma related incidents, knowing this was going to be big. It was set off with the ring of a delivery bicycle bell.<p>"Nihao, airen!"<p>It didn't stop there.<p>"Ranma, for dumping Akane, prepare to die!"<p>"Foul sorcerer, in fleeing thy lecherous grasp, the fair Tendo Akane has been driven to the arms of another of thy dark harem. Thou shall pay and I shall release all women from thy evil spell."<p>It grew worse.<p>Splash.<p>"Wretched harridan, what have you done with my Ranma-sama?"<p>"Somebody get this pig offa me."<p>"Bweeee! Be beweee bwee."<p>Akane paused in her pounding of Kuno. "Ranma! Quit picking on P-chan,"<p>"Ranma, for stealing Shampoo from me, I will slay you."<p>"Growf." _I'm not Ranma, foolish boy._<p>"So, muko-dono, I hear you've been dumped. Shampoo can comfort you on the trip to China."<p>"I ain't goin' to China."<p>"Hotcha! Ranma-chan, if you pose in this brassiere for me, I'll give you a secret technique."<p>"That's it, I'm outta here." OnnaRanma leapt the fence. Naturally the others followed and were joined by still others.<p>"Woah. Check out the cute babes. One of them will go out with me."<p>"Darling!" Zzzzaaappp.<p>"Stand still Fem-boy. I'm gonna pound you until I get a new name."<p>"Charlotte, my darling Charlotte."<p>"Let go of me, you ditz. Ah, the pigtailed girl who so sweetly fled my kiss. I shall bestow another upon her."<p>"Woof, woof."<p>"Checkers?" Akane wondered how the dog had arrived. "Ryoga isn't here. But I'm sure we'll find him."<p>From the sidewalk, more observers were drawn in.<p>"Say, Makoto, wasn't that Ranma?" Usagi found she was talking to a dust cloud. Minako was in hot pursuit of Makoto, waving a bento.<p>"Who's Ranma?" Rei asked as she and Ami joined Usagi in the chase.<p>A girl with a rug beater overtook them, a smaller girl easily keeping up.<p>"Ranma is the heir of our Dojo. We're going to beat him up and take it back."<p>"Natsumi, I'm hungry."<p>A runaway horse joined in, carrying a girl and a boy.<p>"Ushiko-san."<p>"Umao-san."<p>"Aloha, keike and wahine. You be gettin' a hair cut soon."<p>"Oh! Keichi, look. A parade."<p>"Funny, I didn't think it was a holiday, Bell."<p>"MORISATO! Come help chase da gurls."<p>"Why chase them when a Goddess of Love is right here?" The platinum tressed beauty posed seductively, distracting a large portion of the chase.<p>"Wow, Tokyo sure is crowded this time of year, Narusagwa-san."<p>"Keitaro, get your hand off of my..."<p>Akane, Ukyo and Shampoo held up cards, scoring the punch. 4.0, 3.9, 1.9 (the Chinese always think they can do better.)<p>A bunch of shrunken, bald old men in ninja garb appeared.<p>At a gamer store others felt the disturbance.<p>"[Som3thing 3vil this way c0m3s.]"<p>"Piro-san, Largo-san is mumbling about zombies again."<p>"Don't worry about Largo, Ping-chan. Did you see that riot Hayasaka-san?"<p>"No. And neither did you."<p>"Yes ma'am."<p>Another splash.<p>"A Youma. Chibi Prism Eternal Make Up!"<p>"Roar!" Feathers and pieces of yeti fur flew all directions along with a jet of octopus ink.<p>"I thought Chibi Moon had gone back to the future?"<p>"Just an imitator, Usagi-chan. Look, her attack is much more effective than Chibi Moon's."<p>"Whee. This is almost as much fun as playing with Emi-chan."<p>"Stand still you defective, cat brained android! I want your body!" Several explosions followed.<p>Three girls watched the havoc from the observation deck of Tokyo tower.<p>"I must agree with Umi-San, Hikaru-San. That red haired girl does resemble you very strongly."<p>Hikaru jumped back from the viewer with a cry.<p>"What's wrong?" Her friends chorused.<p>"The timer ran out." Sweat drops formed on her friend's heads.<p>Back at the chase.<p>"Ryoganii-chan, all these people are picking on me."<p>"How dare you bother my sister! Bakusai tenketsu."<p>"Ranchan, why are you pretending to be Ryoga's sister? Ryoga doesn't have a sister."<p>"Tee hee."<p>"Ranma quit picking on Ryoga."<p>"Ranma, because of you I have seen hell!"<p>"Aiyah! That going to be very big Shi Shi Hodokan."<p>"Ranma, for seducing Shampoo, you must... huh?"<p>"I strike for the freedom of women. Tatatatatata."<p>"I will free my Ranma-sama, you red haired harridan."<p>"SHI SHI HODOKAN!"<p>From her perch on a nearby building, OnnaRanma winced as the heavy ki slammed into the ground, flattening everyone in the street.<p>"That had to hurt."<p>Around her the Senshi, both Serenity's and Tranquility's nodded agreement. Noting the presence of more people than she expcted, OnnaRanma turned and looked around. Akane and Ukyo were blinking at the presence of the five other girls.<p>"Hey," OnnaRanma exclaimed. "You're those girls from the other day. Tsukino somebody, Aino, and Kino Makoto. You didn't tell me you were the Bishonen Sailors."<p>Akane bonked the smaller girl on the head with her fist. "That's Bishoujo Senshi, you moron."<p>OnnaRanma pulled her feet loose from the roof and stuck her tongue out at Akane. "Bidaaaaa."<p>Akane red-eyed her back. "Bleaaaahhhhh."<p>"Ano..." Sailor Moon began. There was something strangely familiar about this scene. She stepped back when they both turned to look at her. "You must have mistaken us for someone else."<p>"Nah. Nobody else in Japan would wear meatballs on their head like that. Besides you mostly look just like you did in the Silver Millennium. A bit older than I recall."<p>Akane bopped OnnaRanma again. "Be respectful, baka. That's Serenity-hime."<p>The Inner Scouts sweat dropped as OnnaRanma extricated her feet again. "Would you stop with the hitting already? This place is gonna leak next time it rains."<p>"Wait!" Mercury interrupted, before the fight could escalate. "Who are you?"<p>OnnaRanma nodded. "Fair question. I'm Senshi Nike. That's Senshi Vulcan and she's Senshi Aurora. And this is Senshi Alexis."<p>"Oh! Nabiki. How did you get here?" Akane looked concerned.<p>"It's amazing what being a Senshi does for your endurance and strength," Nabiki said. "Kasumi said we're expecting important guests. I think Velocity is one of them, and she mentioned something about the Silence Bringer." She glanced down toward the street. "What happened to them?"<p>"Ryoga got a bit upset," OnnaRanma replied. "They'll be OK. Let's get home then, if we're having guests."<p>Moon and the others scurried to catch up with the fast moving martial artists. Even Nabiki was roof hopping as fast as Akane, with a fair bit more grace. They had just come within sight of the Dojo when OnnaRanma stopped. The rest all came to a halt behind her.<p>She turned and looked the rest of them over. "All right. My mother is still down there, and that means she's going to be happy to see all of you. It's best to just smile and nod. Don't claim to be my girlfriend or fiancee. Don't hug me, glomp me, or even look at me hopefully. I hardly know any of you and I'd hate to end up getting into an arranged marriage with any of you. If she says anything about engagements, omai, marriage, or even dating, deny that you're interested, claim you're sick, or something."<p>The Inners were staring at OnnaRanma like she'd grown another head. Nabiki and Akane were nodding, and Ukyo was scowling.<p>"Ano, what if we don't?" Venus asked.<p>"You remember what happened to Elder Uranus after the soccer game?"<p>The mention of it suddenly brought the memory rushing back to the Inner Scouts. They all shuddered with the memory of the humiliation the Elder Uranus had gone through. Of course the memory of <i>why</i> she had been put through that came also. OnnaRanma nodded as she saw understanding on their faces.<p>"<i>I</i> won't shave your hair first," she promised.<p>All of them, even Moon, nodded frantically in agreement. Satisfied, OnnaRanma turned back to the house in time to see a car pull up. Four women got out and entered the house. She nodded again and hopped down to the wall of the compound. The others followed, and lined up by the porch as OnnaRanma and Akane called out their arrival.<p>"Tadima."<p>"Okari nasai," Kasumi called. She opened one of the shogi to the living room and stopped as she saw Ranma's guests.<p>"Kuso," Nabiki muttered. "I forgot about that."<p>Akane smacked her forehead. "She still has that problem?" Her question was rhetorical as it became obvious that Kasumi was out of action. A huge smile formed on her face as she sank to her knees.<p>"What's wrong with her?" Sailor Moon asked. Kasumi twitched suddenly and sighed, slumping further.<p>Nabiki shrugged. "She's had a Sailor Moon fetish since you guys first appeared three years ago. Apparently something happened yesterday that set it off again. She muttered something about naked Sailor Senshi..."<p>Moon, Venus, and Jupiter suddenly blushed. OnnaRanma burst out laughing. The others looked confused while OnnaRanma walked over and began whispering in Kasumi's ear. Kasumi blinked and suddenly turned bright red. Nodoka entered with the guests in tow as Kasumi dashed for the kitchen. OnnaRanma followed to get hot water.<p>Nodoka stared in surprise at the seifukued girls standing in the yard. Instantly she was searching her sleeves and pockets. She paused when a camera was held out in front of her. She raised her eyes and met Nabiki's gaze. With a twinkle in her eye, Nabiki held out her hand.<p>"Five thousand yen."<p>To Nabiki's surprise two five-thousand yen bills were slapped into her hand as the camera was snagged from the other. She twitched as she realized that her spare film was no longer in her pocket. She glanced speculatively at Nodoka, who was busy getting the Inners to pose for her.<p>Akane glanced at the new guests. Velocity was immediately recognizable by the fact that she was vibrating with the effort to control herself. The two older women were vaguely familiar, and they were staring in surprise at the yard, though whether at Nodoka's actions or the presence of the Senshi was difficult to tell.<p>The other girl immediately caught her attention. She was dressed to catch attention in a purple chengosam. It accented her legs, the split at the sides making them look longer. It also enhanced her other features, especially her large purple eyes. She had the slightest touch of make up and was wearing low heels. Attention was further drawn to her since she was the shortest of the four guests.<p>Akane felt a pang of jealousy. A nudge from her side told her Ukyo felt it too. And the sight of Ranma, slightly steaming, frozen in the doorway as he stared, nearly sent her reaching for her mallet. Ukyo's hand on her arm restrained her.<p>Nabiki realized that she was the best candidate to take charge and stepped forward. She bowed.<p>"Welcome to the Tendo Dojo. I'm Tendo Nabiki. You're friends of Auntie Nodoka?"<p>The blonde started to speak but was pre-empted by her companion.<p>"Kaioh Michiru, and this is Ten'oh Haruka. Our ward, Tomoe Hotaru, and her friend, Haiyama Yoshimi." She bowed. "We were informed that Yoshimi would find her companions here."<p>Nabiki glanced toward Nodoka. The others followed her gaze for a moment. "I believe that we know her companions. Why don't you sit down? My sister, Kasumi will be out shortly with tea and snacks. We'll be able to discuss this in a moment." Nabiki gestured to the table as she turned to the yard. Kasumi came bustling out with her arms full and Ranma jumped to help her.<p>Nabiki chuckled as, the blushing Hotaru joined the others at the table. Yoshimi sat at the end away from Ranma. Akane and Ukyo sat down across from the two women forcing Ranma to sit next to Hotaru. Kasumi served tea and laid out crackers and cookies. To the surprise of those who knew him, Ranma offered cookies to the girl at his side before helping himself. Akane was turning livid but Ukyo seemed to be keeping her in check. Nabiki went out into the yard.<p>"Auntie?"<p>Nodoka seemed to snap back to reality. "Nabiki! Do you have more film? The Senshi are so friendly and cooperative." She gestured broadly at the girls. "Have you met them? This is Sailor Moon."<p>"Auntie. Kasumi says we need more cakes. Otherwise we won't be able to entertain our guests."<p>"Oh dear. Would she like me to go get some? What type?"<p>Nabiki grinned. "Yes Auntie. Get the sesame and poppy seed cakes from Yoshida's. He'll probably have a fresh batch. And you can get more film while you're out. Remember the 800 speed works the best with this camera. And if you happen to see any instant film, my Polaroid is out too." Nabiki slipped a few bills into Nodoka's hand and ushered her toward the door. The Senshi waved. "I'll make sure they wait until you come back," Nabiki promised as she all but shoved Nodoka out the front door. Kasumi met her as she was coming back.<p>"Daddy and Saotome-San are out for the day. The usual. I called Yoshida-San. He said it will be at least thirty minutes for a new batch. He'll keep her as long as possible and call when she leaves."<p>"Good job sis. Obviously Akane is the only one who didn't inherit Mom's talents."<p>Kasumi smiled. "She always was Daddy's girl." They reentered the main room.<p>Ranma had brought out the spare table section and moved the couch so that all of them could sit together. The Inner Senshi were lined up along one side. Yoshimi, Akane and Ukyo had moved to the same side as Haruka and Michiru. Ranma was seated at one end next to Hotaru. Kasumi sat next to Yoshimi at the corner of the empty end leaving the end spot for Nabiki. The others fell quiet as she sat down. She glanced down the length of the table and met Ranma's gaze. A slight tilt of her head made Ranma blush and straighten up. Nabiki nodded.<p>"I suppose you're wondering why I've called you all here," Ranma said. Everyone blinked.<p>"Ranma!" Akane started to rise, but Ukyo restrained her again.<p>Hotaru giggled then blushed when all eyes focused on her.<p>"Er, sorry 'bout that. We've met the Inners, which means that you will be the Outers?"<p>Haruka and Michiru tried to look innocent.<p>"Oh don't start," Ranma growled. "You're all Serenity-hime's Senshi. And we're Tranquility-hime's. Senshi Alexis and Senshi Harmony, Senshi Vulcan and Senshi Aurora, and I'm Senshi Nike. You've met Senshi Velocity already it seems." He indicated each by their name. "Now that Velocity is here we can wake Athena and find Tranquility-hime."<p>"You're a Senshi?" Haruka was skeptical. "No way a guy can be a Senshi."<p>Ranma smiled. "Eternal Victory Make Up!" The light show increased as the others transformed. Serenity and her Senshi stared at the Senshi of Tranquility. Suddenly Haruka leaped to her feet and pointed at Nike.<p>"You!" She exclaimed. "I owe you for that fight. Uranus Star Power! Make Up!"<p>Nike shrugged and waited until Uranus and the others had finished transforming. Vulcan noticed that she kept her eyes averted from Saturn. Nike sighed in boredom.<p>"Look, Blondie," Nike drawled. "If you want a rematch, I'll be happy to kick your butt. I know a few places we can fight and not damage any houses."<p>Uranus growled and looked ready to leap across the table, but Neptune restrained her for a moment. That was long enough for Sailor Moon to react.<p>"Uranus! You will not fight these Senshi. They are my sister's friends and guardians and you will treat them as you do the rest of us." Moon had shed her seifuku and was wearing a simple white gown. Great white wings were carefully folded behind her.<p>Uranus stepped back in surprise and then bowed to her princess. "Yes, Serenity-hime. I'm sorry."<p>Alexis suddenly spoke causing Serenity and her Senshi to stare. Harmony hid her smile and Velocity burst out laughing.<p>"What did she say?" Nike was pretty certain she knew, but she asked so the others would hear.<p>Harmony lowered her hand. "She is offering five to one odds against Sailor Uranus."<p>There was a moment of silence. Serenity dropped her face to her hands. Uranus turned a rather alarming shade of purple and Jupiter jumped the table to help Neptune restrain her from attacking indiscriminately. Mercury patted Serenity comfortingly. Vulcan and Aurora had moved to the side, forming a line with Harmony and Alexis. Velocity had risen to her feet next to Nike and Saturn was next to them looking uncertain. Mars and Venus were in ready stances, but were trying not to look offensive. The tense moment was broken by a crash from the door.<p>Nodoka was in shock as she dropped the groceries and fumbled for her camera. Not only were all of the original Senshi here, but the new ones as well and even more that hadn't been seen. She was in heaven. Fourteen Senshi right in her friend's house. She brought up her camera and focused, just in time to see the blonde Sailor Uranus step toward her with an upraised hand.<p>Before Nodoka could react to the unexpected attack, the shortest of the new Senshi stepped between her and Sailor Uranus. It was the same one that had rescued her from the Youma. She lowered the camera.<p>"Don't." Nike's voice brought Uranus to a halt.<p>Aurora suddenly spoke. "How sure are you of those two, Serenity? Yesterday we saw them letting innocent people get devoured by a Darkling."<p>"What?" Moon's voice rose an octave.<p>"Yeah," Vulcan agreed. "They might be corrupted." She produced several pieces of metal and wiring and assembled them into a shoulder mounted cannon of some sort. A bright red spot appeared on Uranus back as Vulcan brought the weapon to bear.<p>Neptune brought out her Mirror but found her wrist caught in Velocity's gentle but unbreakable grip. Alexis was floating and the Inners were powering up. Venus had her chain out and Jupiter's projector had risen from her tiara. Sailor Moon was beginning to tear up as her Senshi prepared to fight with her sister's.<p>Nike sighed. This whole leadership thing was a pain. "Harmony."<p>"Of course Nike-San," Harmony sang. "Now let's all calm down and talk about this like rational people."<p>Her song was irresistible. Venus and Jupiter powered down. Neptune and Uranus stored their talismans. Serenity stopped crying, to the relief of Mars and Mercury. Nodoka slumped, asleep, and nearly fell, but Nike caught her.<p>"I'll be right back. Don't let them kill each other, please." Nike carried Nodoka upstairs and laid her on a futon in the guest room. She came back to find the seating had changed. Serenity and her Senshi were on one side of the table and Tranquility's were along the other. Serenity and her Senshi looked a bit disturbed.<p>"Perhaps introductions are in order," Nike said as she joined the others. "I am Senshi Nike. The Senshi of Victory. It is my power to win if I am willing to pay the price. The greater the final victory, the higher the price."<p>Vulcan was next. "I am Senshi Vulcan, the Senshi of Creativity. It is my power to create anything that can be imagined. But I can only create from the imagination of others."<p>"Senshi Aurora, the Senshi of Light. I control light and where there is light I cannot die."<p>"Senshi Harmony, the Senshi of Harmony. Both the musical form and the emotion. I have the power to bring peace and harmony to all."<p>Harmony translated for Alexis. "Senshi Alexis, the Senshi of Gravity. All gravity and mathematics fall under my power."<p>"-Senshi Velocity-," she said. "-Senshi of Motion and Energy. I draw my power form the motion of the Universe.-"<p>Nike paused to let the information settle in. The play of emotion across the faces of the Scouts was rather entertaining. The silence continued to stretch out until Saturn spoke.<p>"Pluto told me you weren't all as powerful as Velocity," she pouted.<p>Nike laughed. "We aren't. Minerva is actually more powerful. Being the Senshi of Wisdom gives her a lot of knowledge."<p>Saturn sighed again. "I won't stand much of a chance against you, if it comes to that."<p>"That's the point, Saturn-chan. We're supposed to be able to stop you before you start destroying things. Same way the Inners are supposed to stop Pluto should she go rogue."<p>Silence.<p>"We're what?" Mars and Venus demanded together.<p>Nike shrugged. "You don't remember? The four inner Senshi are the fail safe should Pluto turn rogue or join the Dark. Surely you didn't think you were just bodyguards for the Princess?"<p>In a small restaurant in a different part of Nerima, another group plotted. A dark haired young man, his shock of hair held out of his eyes by a bandanna, glared at the others suspiciously. The shrunken old woman met his gaze impassively. Her purple haired young ward was not nearly as controlled.<p>"Why should I trust you?" Ryoga remembered the training for the bakusai tenketsu.<p>"Aiyah, lost-boy is stubborn like piggy he turn into." Shampoo wondered why her great-grandmother thought they needed this male.<p>Cologne smiled at Ryoga. "Because, boy," she said, ignoring her granddaughter. "You want Akane and we want Ranma. Once they are separated, you will be able to make your move." She indicated the bottle on the table. It was a love potion she had caught Shampoo preparing to use. Cologne had taken time to explain the exact effect of this particular formula and now Shampoo was in a hurry to get rid of it. The potion wouldn't do what Shampoo hoped it would, but it was going to be an interesting show. Especially considering the apparent presence of Senshi in Nerima.<p>"Use that how I told you and you'll get your wish."<p>"What about Ranma? You won't hurt him?"<p>Shampoo laughed. "Only so he enjoy it."<p>Ryoga shuddered and glanced at Cologne who had rolled her eyes at Shampoo's attempt at humor. Ryoga took the jar and slipped it into his pack.<p>"Why don't you stay here until tomorrow?" Cologne suggested. "You'll be well rested and we'll make sure you're on time."<p>Ryoga paused then nodded. "Thanks Oba-san."<p>FIN.<p>
