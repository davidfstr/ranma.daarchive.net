</div><p>Tranquility Protocols Chapter 6<p>Tendo Nabiki wasn't a morning person. She detested waking up before noon. Especially after going to bed as the sun was rising. She also rarely had dreams that she remembered. Which was why she was startled.<p>The light coming through her window was definitely early morning and she felt utterly refreshed. She sat up. Her thesis was neatly piled on her desk. She had finished it the night before and was ready to present it to her professor. A stray thought occurred, causing her to wonder about the whole situation; but she dismissed the nagging sense of wrongness. If she didn't hurry, she'd be late, and Elder Senshi Mercury's lectures tended to fill up fast.<p>She made it to the lecture hall, just in time to be the second one in line, right behind the Royal entourage. She was concerned with finding a seat and never noticed one of the Royal Twins staring at her.<p>The lecture was as interesting as she had hoped and she jotted stacks of notes. She was juggling her notes and her Thesis, trying to squeeze them both into her satchel, when she bumped into some one. Her papers spilled across the floor as she tumbled.<p>"Hey, watch where you're..." She broke off as she realized who was standing there. "Sensei Mercury!"<p>The Elder Senshi smiled an apology and crouched to gather the spilled papers. She paused with her first handfull as she saw the title of the thesis. Before Nabiki could object, the woman was skimming the entire paper.<p>"You're certain of these findings?"<p>Nabiki nodded, shocked by the intensity of the Senshi's question.<p>"You realize the corollary to this? This is amazing. You are quite a credit to Mercury's school systems."<p>Nabiki blushed at the comment. She found that her tongue seemed too big for her mouth and she was trying to dig her toe through the marble floor. Here she was, facing her heroine, a scene she had imagined numerous times, and nothing was going right.<p>A new voice interrupted. "It seems I have to thank you for finding another of my Senshi, Mercury-san."<p>They turned toward the new voice. Nabiki thought the dark haired girl looked familiar, but her companion was unknown. She quickly tried to remember where she had seen the girl before. Senshi Mercury's actions brought the memory back.<p>"Your Highness," the Senshi said as she bowed. "This is one of your Senshi?"<p>Princess Tranquility nodded. "Good afternoon, Alexis."<p>Her piercing gaze speared Nabiki, holding her motionless as the Bond formed. Nabiki writhed in the grasp of the power until she abruptly figured out how to accept the summons. The transformation was awesome. She had knowledge and power. She could control the forces that held the universe together. Her eyes met Tranquility's again and she felt the sadness there along with the welcome and love. There would be a price to pay for the knowledge and the power. The newest Senshi of Gravity hoped she'd be able to pay the price and not fail her Princess.<p>****<p>Akane sighed as she heard the shouts. She politely excused herself from the cluster of women around Pygmalion and started toward the altercation. The shouts turned to screams of pain and she increased her pace, hoping to save Athena's latest victim from lasting damage.<p>Sure enough, behind a hedge in the large garden, Athena was sitting on a slightly older boy while she fended off two of his friends. The two blondes were having trouble rescuing their red haired friend from the little princess. Said princess was taking every opportunity to pound on her squirming ground cushion, who was screaming like a little girl. Akane rolled her eyes and lifted the hem of her gown to step over the low hedge.<p>"Would one of you like to explain what is happening here?" She laid her hands on the shoulders of the two boys before they could charge Athena.<p>"Your Highness," they exclaimed. "We were just..."<p>Athena rose to her feet, casually balancing on her hapless victim. "They were just picking on Princess Serenity. This one even called her 'Endymion's Toy'." She emphasized her meaning with a stamp of her heeled sandal. The poor boy screamed again. She hopped off and came to stand by Akane.<p>"You boys should really know better than to say such things in the presence of loyal Royalty. Had it been Aeres, no doubt one of you would be dead."<p>The palest of the blond boys straightened indignantly. "We are Prince Endymion's retainers. You and your House have no authority over us." The red head nodded emphatically from behind the larger boy. Akane laughed.<p>"Come along, Athena," she said, taking her younger sister's hand. "Queen Serenity will be meeting with the Family soon. Minor issues with Earth's bully boys can wait." She ignored the red-eye her sister gave the three boys as they headed toward the palace.<p>Shortly they were met by Aura, and the three of them headed to the main throne room together. The guards at the door stopped them.<p>"Apologies, Your Highness," one said. "You and Princess Athena may enter, but Lady Aura must remain here. Her Majesty's orders." He added the last phrase at the look Akane was giving him.<p>"I am countering those orders," she said softly. "Or you can go and explain to my mother why I am not there to meet Queen Serenity. If Aura cannot enter then I will not."<p>As the guard started to stammer, a new voice interrupted.<p>"Perhaps I can be of assistance in solving this matter."<p>The guard looked relieved for a moment, until he saw the newcomer and her companion. He suddenly went very pale. The three girls turned to see who would cause a Martian Royal Guard to tremble.<p>The two girls were unremarkable, in spite of their similarities. One had dark hair and the other was bright red. They had similar braids, except for the crescent-blade clip the red head wore. The red head was also slightly taller and was certainly more mature than her companion. The dark haired girl seemed very familiar, but Akane couldn't remember any ten year old girls that she knew.<p>The girl turned her dark gaze on the guard. "Only the Royal Family and their guards are allowed inside? By order of Queen Hippolyte?" The guard frantically nodded. "Then you may allow Lady Aura in, as she is a Senshi like her companions."<p>"Senshi?" Akane was as surprised as the guards and her companions.<p>"Senshi Aurora, Senshi Vulcan, and Senshi Candidate Mars." The girl gestured to Aura, Akane, and Athena in turn. "Now open the door. We are going to be late." He tone brooked no argument, and the guard found himself obeying before he had a chance to think.<p>"Her Highness, Princess Tranquility," the majordomo announced. Akane was fairly certain there was some magic involved that told him the names of the next arrivals. "Their Highnesses Akane, Senshi Vulcan, and Athena, Senshi Candidate Mars. Lady Aura, Senshi Aurora. And Mordaé."<p>Akane had the satisfaction of seeing her mother start in surprise which flushed to anger when Aura was mentioned. But the sudden rush of power and energy washed that away as the Bond formed with the young Moon Princess. The fact that her best friend and lover was a Senshi as well was icing on the cake.<p>****<p>Seven girls stood together in a small ante chamber, waiting for Queen Serenity. They were anxious, as this would be their last day as Senshi for Princess Tranquility. They had proven their skill and worth, and this was their reward.<p>"Is this a dream?" Akane asked, peering around in confusion.<p>"Yes and no," Nike responded.<p>"Ranma! Get out of my dream you hentai!" Akane tried to punish him with her mallet.<p>Nike laughed. "Wrong all around, Vulcan. Not your dream, not Ranma, and not hentai."<p>Aurora laid a hand on Vulcan's arm. "Calmly, Love. We're trying to help each other understand, not irrevocably damage our 'hosts'."<p>For a moment there were two of each of them except Velocity. Akane, Ranma, Ukyo, Nabiki, and Kasumi stared at their Senshi counterparts.<p>"How come Velocity doesn't have a double?" Ranma demanded. "And who are you?" He turned his gaze on the double for Senshi Minerva. The woman laughed.<p>"Don't recognize me muko-dono? I admit I appear a bit younger, but surely I've aged well?" She continued snickering as shocked recognition flashed across the faces in front of her. "You didn't think I got to be three hundred years old by eating healthy and getting exercise?"<p>Ranma recovered first. "Cologne is Senshi Minerva?" Nike bopped him lightly. "Respect your Elders."<p>"Actually," Cologne said, "I'm not a Senshi. Unlike the rest of you, I never fully 'hosted' Minerva. Also unfortunately, I don't know how to awaken her. That is your job, muko-dono."<p>Akane waved her arms in frustration. "What's going on? What do you mean by 'host'?"<p>Minerva spoke quietly. "Because we are not fully active when the Silver Millennium falls, we cannot be sent to the future like Serenity-hime and her Senshi. So our Spirits must find hosts. You are the people most like us in the future where we must manifest, so you will become our hosts. In most cases we merge fully with you, becoming a blend of yourself and us. In my case, merging with Cologne would cause problems such as memory loss and blurring of knowledge. As the Senshi of Wisdom, I can hardly afford such a loss. But there is a way for me to merge with a mindless and soulless body. The hard part is finding one."<p>Nike chimed in. "When we have accomplished our tasks, we will simply leave you. You will remember everything that happened to you, and perhaps have some memories of this time as well, but you will be yourselves again, without any of the powers that come from being a Senshi."<p>"What about you?" Kasumi asked, concern evident in her voice.<p>"We do not know," Harmony answered. "But we are willing to pay the price to save humanity form the Darkness."<p>"What about her?" Nabiki pointed at Velocity.<p>Velocity grinned. "My sister, Princess Pluto, intervened on my behalf and convinced Serenity-sama that I would make an excellent Courier. I don't know how I ended up in your time, but, like Plutoneechan, I never died."<p>The others stared at her.<p>"What? Can't I talk normally?"<p>"But how are we here?" Ukyo chimed in.<p>Aurora answered. "You aren't. This is just a memory dream. The memory of our spirits are talking with your semi-conscious minds. Hopefully you'll all remember this and we'll become closer to merging. We'll need to be one with each other before the end."<p>The temporary separation was ended by the arrival of the Queen of the Moon Kingdom.<p>"It is time," she said simply. The Senshi nodded in resignation and followed her out of the room.<p>****<p>Four girls woke in tears, the horrible memory of their dream still strong. Ranma however sat up suddenly as an idea came to him. He hastily scribbled a letter, pausing to boot his father back out the window, and dashed downstairs to get it in the mail. He made it to the mail box just as the postman was delivering the morning mail. The man accepted the letter, ignoring the panda being fended off.<p>"Selling your panda to the Chinese breeding program?"<p>"They wouldn't take him," Ranma replied, booting the beast back into the koi pond. "Something about Ling Ling pounding on him the one time they tried."<p>The post man laughed and hurried on his way.<p>_You'd sell out your Father, boy?_<p>"Yeah pop, but I'd make sure to get <i>two</i> bowls of rice and <i>three</i> pickles. After all, panda skin rugs are hard to come by these days." Ranma kicked Genma into the koi pond a third time and went to go bathe before breakfast.<p>-<p>Creatures from the Darkness come in three main categories. The most intelligent of them ranked their kind by intelligence (or lack thereof) and considered themselves the most powerful servants of Darkness. The strongest of them assessed their associates by their strength. And they considered all others weaker than themselves. The third kind really didn't pay much attention to others of their kind. They were hardly intelligent and relatively weak. But they had one advantage over those that believed them inferior. The most dangerous of the Darklings (at least to humanity) were those that could stand the Light.<p>The presence of many millions of humans, each with their own bit of Light, was deadly to most Creatures of Darkness. Much the same way that combining the flickering lights of millions of candles would create a brilliant, huge fire. Though they fed on the Light, too much would drown and destroy them.<p>But those Darklings who had the least power and the lowest intelligence could stand in the presence of so much light. Of course, they were driven insane and could think only of destroying the source of their pain and suffering. Which made them excellent shock troops and terror units, but left them out of the actual battle against the Light.<p>Still, there were missions for which they were perfect, and since they were easy to summon, the Darkling General felt that a few could be used to deal with these annoying Senshi. It was convenient for him to forget that all those sent to find and destroy the Senshi hadn't come back. Eventually one of his expendable troops would succeed. Or he might just send in a smarter and more powerful group. But for now, tests and probes would do.<p>-<p>Sailor Moon paused to catch her breath and see who was still with her. Sailor Mars was on her left and Sailor Venus had managed to keep up on the right.<p>"Mercury?"<p>Mars shook her head. "Jupiter dropped back to help. I think she said she'd catch up if she could."<p>"Here it comes," Venus moaned. Mars turned and fired a blast of flame to attract the Darkling's attention. They turned and ran. The flames had no more effect than before.<p>They saw Uranus waving ahead of them and turned down the street she was on. Neptune sent a wave of water down the road to slow the Darkling, while they paused again.<p>"Saturn is in place. Pluto had to stretch her limitations, but we got everyone out of the area." Uranus was slightly breathless. The rest were panting too hard to do more than nod. They had discovered early in the fight that the Darkling was completely immune to their magic. Except Sailor Moon's attack, but any time she began to power up, the creature would head straight for her, never giving her enough time to complete the attack.<p>Now they were almost to the docks. The Outers had gone ahead to evacuate as many people as possible so they could really cut loose. In the meantime, Mercury had gotten her leg broken. The creature seemed to target the Senshi of Ice as much as Sailor Moon. Jupiter had gone to help her to safety.<p>Venus and Mars were both badly bruised and Venus had several cuts along one arm where she had been tossed though a window. They were all looking a bit bedraggled. Uranus suddenly signaled and they all took off running again, the creature hot on their trail.<p>Saturn was waiting in an empty loading yard. They gathered around her and caught their breaths. For a long moment they all looked at each other. Venus was the first to speak.<p>"We have to herd it in here and distract it long enough to let Moon use her attack." She paused while the others nodded. "All right, Mars, you and Uranus go to the right, Neptune and I will go left. Saturn, you have the best chance of holding it long enough to let Moon get her attack off, so you stay here." She glanced around. "The thing is immune to our attacks, but not to collateral damage."<p>Uranus nodded in understanding and picked up a nearby I-beam. Mars gathered up some rebar, and Neptune discovered that one of the cargo containers was full of metal disks the size of manhole covers. She passed a few of these to Moon as well. Venus produced her Chain and attached a chunk of concrete the size of her head to one end. She sent it whistling through the air a couple of times, pausing when Mars handed her a shard of plate glass. It was as long as her arm and sheared off to a sharp point. She grinned at Mars.<p>"Thanks," Venus said. "Now it's just like old times." She attached the shard to the other end of her chain, forming a sickle at that end. She twirled both ends and struck a pose. The others all chuckled. She nodded. "Let's go."<p>Mars and Uranus flitted from building to building, watching for their target. They had just spotted it when Uranus caught Mars' arm, preventing her from throwing a rebar spear. Mars turned and saw what Uranus had noticed. They grinned at each other, and Uranus grabbed one of the white canisters.<p>Venus led the way as she and Neptune circled toward the shadow creature. They had just come within range when Neptune noticed a strange, flying shape. She grabbed Venus as a flaming arrow rose and intercepted the oblong object. It erupted flame and went rocketing into the building next to the Darkling. The second and third missiles struck true, exploding against the monster and rocking it back. Neptune groaned as she heard a voice yelling "Mars Propane Projectile."<p>Mars glared at Uranus as she rubbed her head. "What? Why'd you hit me?"<p>"Stop with the dumb attack names," Uranus grumbled. She hefted her I-beam and hurled it at the Darkling. Mars fired her rebar after and they turned to run as the creature charged them.<p>"You're just mad that you didn't come up with a name first," Mars taunted. Uranus growled and followed the fleet fire priestess.<p>Venus trailed the monster, waiting for an opening. As the thing was crossing a street, she struck, lashing out with the shard of glass in a low sweep. The glass sickle caught its ankle, tripping it up. She sent the concrete weight out in a lightning fast over head strike that slammed into the thing's back. Neptune hurled a pair of disks.<p>"If you shout some silly attack name, I'm going to clobber you and leave you here," she called to Venus.<p>Venus grinned back. "You don't like my <i>kusari-gama</i> Love Harvester?" Neptune shook her fist at the blonde Senshi and they hurried to catch up with Mars and Uranus.<p>Moon waited near the edge of the loading yard and tried to figure out what had changed about her friends. Venus had never taken tactical command before. And separating Uranus and Neptune was usually only possible with a direct command from Serenity herself. Even Saturn seemed different, though Moon couldn't quite place the change. Saturn noticed Moon staring at her and winked. Moon blushed.<p>"Wondering what's different?" Saturn asked softly. "I've remembered a few things about the Past. As Velocity put it, I 'got my groove back.' I think the appearance of your sister's Senshi is triggering memories and reflexes in all of us. The memories of times when we were the best combat unit in the Imperial Army, even if we were supposed to be for ceremonial purposes only. You didn't train with us much, so you may not be feeling the sense of competition the rest of us are."<p>Moon sighed. "I wish I could remember more of that time."<p>Saturn chuckled. "I think that when your sister appears, you'll remember far more than you want." She glanced in the direction the others had gone. "Here comes our target."<p>It was easy to see. It stood nearly two stories tall and was shrouded in blackness. It was vaguely human shaped, but the roiling mass of shadows around it prevented any identifying features form being seen. Only its bloody red eyes and obsidian sharp claws were clearly visible. The four fleeing Senshi came bounding across the open yard dodging and leaping as the thing hurled pieces of buildings and terrain at them. As they reached the center of the yard, they suddenly broke left and right, leaving Saturn and Moon a clear shot.<p>"Silence Glaive Strike!" Saturn slashed the Glaive down, sending a wave of force into the Darkling. It roared and focused on Saturn and Moon who was charging up her attack. Saturn reversed the Glaive and spun it over her head as she stepped forward. The Darkling charged. Saturn's Glaive slashed down, striking the pavement with a bell tone. From behind the Darkling another tone sounded as a garnet tipped staff struck the ground.<p>Two voices rose as one. "<b>CHRONOS TYPHOON!"</b><p>Time and space ripped asunder around the Darkling. It was spun in place, frozen in time and accelerated through time all at once. It was pulled in a dozen directions by spatial rifts and slashed by dimensional vortices. But when the distortion died down, the Darkling was still standing.<p>"<b>Eternal Moonlight Fire!"</b><p>Saturn and Pluto had delayed it long enough for Moon to get her attack off. Streamers of white fire surrounded the beast and burned away the darkness. The moon-fire danced across the thing sending it to the ground in spasms of pain. Shortly it trembled one last time and lay unmoving.<p>The Senshi gathered around their Princess to congratulate her. The Darkling quickly and silently rose to strike while its targets were all in one place. Suddenly a rose flashed past and stuck in the ground at its feet.<p>"The Shadow of Evil approaches the delicate flower but I will not let that flower fall."<p>"Tuxedo Kamen." Most of the girls instantly assumed that their black and white clad rescuer was their friend. And the figure did indeed resemble the Earth Prince. Except that it was not wearing a tuxedo, or a top hat, and the staff it was carrying was certainly not Tuxedo Kamen's normal cane.<p>"Remember Sailor Moon," the figure said. "Love and Justice aren't the only weapons at your disposal. And remember that you can call on your sister's Senshi. It is their job to fight the Dark, not yours."<p>The figure leaped into the air and hurled four more flowers. They formed a circle around the Darkling and suddenly flared incandescent. When the Senshi could see again the Darkling and their rescuer were gone.<p>-<p>"He <i>was</i> Tuxedo Kamen," Usagi insisted.<p>"<i>She</i> was Mordaé-Sensei." Saturn was equally insistent.<p>"It couldn't have been either," Haruka pointed out. "Mordaé-Sensei was with Tranquility-hime when Beryl attacked. They couldn't have been sent forward like us. And Mamoru is in America. You just talked to him yesterday, Usagi."<p>The eight young women continued quibbling as they boarded the Metro. Two cloaked figures watched them with amusement.<p>"Did you enjoy yourself?"<p>"Not so much as I might have."<p>The first figured laughed. "Good girl. We wouldn't want them to know so soon."<p>Both figures chuckled quietly and faded away.<p>-<p>The rumors began when Ranma and Akane arrived at school separately. Strangely enough, Akane and Ukyo arrived together, while Ranma arrived alone, under his own power. Nabiki was raking in the yen, as she had some idea of the situation and had plenty of takers for wild bets with long odds. Nobody seemed to care that Nabiki wasn't a student at Furinkan.<p>Akane refused to talk about Ranma, and ignored anyone who said his name. Except once, when someone asked if they had broken up. She had calmly said that she and Ranma had never been "together" and that the engagement was no longer valid. The statement raised no eyebrows, but the fact that she made the claim in a level tone and without any apparent anger netted Nabiki a great deal of the student-body's allowance.<p>Ranma had other worries. He sat on the roof, alone, at lunch and fretted. His mother had appeared at the Tendo's that morning to tell him that he had a date after school. He was to go straight home, without fighting, and get ready.<p>"Man, what do I know about dating girls?"<p>"Nothing, obviously," a voice breathed in his ear.<p>Ranma spun on his rear, rolling to the side and planting a hand to cartwheel to his feet. His target easily avoided the sweep kick, side stepped the jab, and was nose to nose with him when he reached his feet.<p>"Nice moves, Ran-chan," the girl said. "Couldn't have done them better myself."<p>Ranma stepped back and stared. At himself. Herself. Whatever. He noticed differences almost immediately. She had green eyes, the color of new leaves. Her hair was tied in a long braid, held by a crescent-blade clip that dangled near her ankles. Subtler differences became apparent as well, such as the way she stood and her tight, feminine clothing.<p>"Who are you?"<p>She paused, looking a bit surprised. "I hadn't thought of that. Call me Kuroiko." She bowed, showing a generous amount of flesh as her mini-sheath rode up around her thighs and scrunched down around her cleavage.<p>"Black Child?" Ranma raised an eyebrow.<p>She grinned wickedly. "Unless you prefer <i>Yuri</i>ko." She snapped her fingers and Ranma suddenly changed. And as a girl, OnnaRanma decided that she didn't like the emphasis placed on the name, or the way her look-alike was eyeing her.<p>"Er, Kuroiko is just fine. How did you... ?"<p>She held up a finger as he shifted back to male. "Now that..."<p>Ranma leaned forward slightly to catch her explanation.<p>"...is a secret," she said with a wink.<p>"Itai," Ranma mumbled around a mouthful of the roof.<p>"Don't worry, you'll figure it out eventually." She helped him to his feet. "At the moment though, I'm here to help you. With your date problem."<p>"Great, you'll go instead?"<p>Wham.<p>"No, stupid." She helped him to his feet again, which was thoughtful, as she had knocked him down. "I'm going to show you what a date is like. And give you some pointers on avoiding trouble. And then you're going to show Hotaru-chan the time of her life." He didn't miss the implied 'or else.'<p>"You know Hotaru-chan?"<p>"You have a firm grasp of the obvious, don't you?"<p>He stared at her in confusion. She sighed.<p>"OK. Let's just go."<p>"Go?"<p>"Ranma, try to use your brain for something <i>besides</i> tactical analysis. Follow me carefully on this. I'm a girl, you're a boy. I'm here to show you..." She looked at him expectantly.<p>"Er. What a date is?"<p>"Exactly. Now given that I'm a girl and you're a boy, how, exactly, am I likely to accomplish this monumental task? Just take a guess."<p>"Uhm... you have a 'How to' book?"<p>She stopped dead in her tracks and stared at him. She muttered a few vile sounding phrases and paced for several moments, stopping to peer at him every time she turned. Finally she came to a halt.<p>"What's wrong?" He asked cautiously.<p>"You have absolutely no concept of social interaction outside of a fight. The only way you can deal with people is when you are in conflict with them in some way. That explains your reaction to Akane and why Nike chose you as her host."<p>"What? You know about Nike!"<p>"Who?" She was all innocence. Ranma found he couldn't tear his eyes from hers. Suddenly she blinked.<p>"Er, what was I saying?" Ranma asked. He felt a bit bleary.<p>"You were asking me what I like. To eat. Now let's go."<p>She linked her arm through his, startling him as the roof faded away.<p>-<p>Kasumi moved around the house. She hardly had to put any effort into cleaning; her mere presence restored the harmony of the Wa of the house. Even before she had become a Senshi, her control over the flow of the house's spirit had been unusual. Her own form of the Art, she supposed. Not that she wasn't skilled with other aspects of the Art as well. Her ranking in Tai Chi' Chuan would have surprised her father, and she was similarly skilled with Aikido. Nothing so official as belt rankings, but her secret practices with Ranma would no doubt place her among the Master Dans. Kasumi was an expert in the soft arts of redirection and distraction.<p>She moved from the kitchen to the main room as she sensed a disturbance. Happosai-ojisan was returning and would no doubt begin berating his students. A momentary bit of displeasure passed through Kasumi's mind. His actions were disruptive and disturbing. She decided to ask him to restrain himself and the displeasure faded. After all, by showing proper respect, one earned respect in return.<p>She entered the main room, noticing her father and Saotome-ojisan kowtowing to the old man. She sighed and shook her head.<p>"Oji-ji?"<p>Happosai delivered one last glare at his worthless students, and turned to smile at Kasumi. "Yes, Kasumi-chan?"<p>She smiled warmly. "The reputation of a thousand years is determined by the conduct of one hour."<p>Happosai blinked in astonishment. "There you go, boys," he said to his cowering students. "A woman's tongue is more to be feared than the sword."<p>"Remember oji-ji, life is for one generation; a good name is forever."<p>"And to endure what is unendurable is true endurance," he responded with a bow. He politely excused himself and went bounding away toward Shinjuku.<p>"You see, Father? Even oji-ji responds well to proper respect."<p>The two men stared at her as she continued her cleaning. They decided to ignore the strangeness in favor of celebrating the Master's departure.<p>-<p>For months there was talk in Shinjuku about the "Polite Panty Raider." He always asked his victims permission before taking their panties and he left large amounts of cash for them. Muggers, drug pushers, and other violent criminals were found by the police, paralyzed and stripped of their valuables. The legend never quite died, and for years, if a woman needed money desperately, she would think of putting on her best silk under things and visiting Shinjuku.<p>Author Note- Real Life is a harsh taskmaster. Between a job, a spouse and a new apartment, I've had very little time or inspiration to write. I hit several dead ends while doing this chapter and the current version looks very little like the original. I have reached the middle of the story, and I'm floundering around trying to get it to go where I need it to. The beginning and the end were the easy parts.<p>Next Chapter- Nike vs. Happosai. Pantsu Taro. Ranma's date with Hotaru (Will Haruka and Michiru intervene?). And hopefully, the arrival of Senshi Minerva. Oh, and of course, more about the Darkness.<p>Official Disclaimer- I don't own Ranma or Sailor Moon. Tranquility and her Senshi are my own creation and shouldn't be used without permission.<p>-Féadel<p>
