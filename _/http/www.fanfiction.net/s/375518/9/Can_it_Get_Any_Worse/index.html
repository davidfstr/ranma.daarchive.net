</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 8<p>For reasons best left unsaid, the girls decided that wanted to stay on<br/>Pokemon world for a while. Ah, nevermind. They wanted to make their<br/>pokemon stronger and Ami was determined to discover how such creatures<br/>could be so alike in reproductive and evolutionary manner, but so<br/>totally different in physical appearance and varying intelligence.<br/>What did this transalte into? A very long stay in a little city named<br/>Hickory, that's what.<p>Minako and Makoto, in order to fuel their desire to learn as much<br/>about the creatures as possible, took jobs at the local pokemon<br/>center. They don't even have a freakin hospital for people, yet every<br/>damned town has a pokemon center to heal pokemon who've been injured<br/>in battles. Usagi has gone off on a pokemon journey-yes, a pokemon<br/>journey with her electric lamb to become champion of the Pokemon<br/>League. Rei and her rat, that flea bag evolved into the most hideous<br/>wolf rat/beaver thing I've ever seen.<p>And me, what do I do all day? I kick the ass of every pokemon I can.<br/>I'm getting famous for it actually. The Pokemon League(the entire<br/>economy of this planet is based around pokemon) has even started<br/>building a pokemon gym in Hickory for other humans to come to fight<br/>against pokemon. And my egg? Three weeks and not so much as a crack.<br/>I would have thrown it out as a dud weeks ago if Nurse Joy(they even<br/>clone the same nurse to serve at every pokemon center) hadn't checked<br/>it out and ok'ed it.<p>I walked into the bedroom that Ami and I shared in the town's boarding<br/>house. She was just wrapping up a conversation with Usagi on their<br/>wrist radios. She saw me come in and said,"Usagi is in the running<br/>for Pokemon League Champion. She's sending us tickets."<p>"Isn't that a little fast? She's only been gone two weeks." Damnit,<br/>if Makoto had never seen that stupid puppy, we would be home now. I<br/>should look at the bigger picture, like how we're safe from demon<br/>attacks and crazed temporal mages here, but all these pokemon are<br/>annoying.<p>"I don't think she sleeps very much. That and a little magic,<br/>probably, is how she managed to build up her pokemons' power so<br/>quickly. The preliminaries aren't for another month and I have an<br/>invitation from Professor Oak to visit his laboratory. Do you want to<br/>go with me? We can take our time and you can make a few appearances<br/>at the other gyms along the way."<p>Weeks alone with Ami? Sure, no problem."Yeah. When do we leave?"<br/>Maybe I would get to see what was in that egg.<p>"Tomorrow, if that's ok with you?"<p>****<p>"What's this?" I asked Ami as she handed me a black and silver<br/>backpack.<p>"Professor Oak sent them. They're called pokegear. We can keep our<br/>food and pokemon and stuff in them. I bought us some pokeballs encase<br/>we see something interesting along the way." Ingenious devices,<br/>pokeballs. They have a huge storage capacity and a pokemon kept<br/>inside of one needed no food. I plan on taking some back to Earth to<br/>sale to the military. Imagine, every soldier carrying a tank in his<br/>pocket. The prison system could definitely benefit.<p>"Cool."<p>We weren't bothered by many wild pokemon while walking through the<br/>tall grass that the Pokemon League kept growing everywhere. I have a<br/>feeling that they were scared of me. I let Ami and her Butterfree<br/>named Sparkles handle those brave enough to attack us. She really got<br/>a kick out of the experience and I could literally feel, if barely, an<br/>increase in the pokemon's power after every battle.<p>The first night we camped out at the base of a small mountain in the<br/>middle of the forest. Ami had caught a little ball of rock with arms<br/>that she insisted I accept since my egg was such a late bloomer.<p>"It's small now," she assured me,"but they get big and strong. Here,"<br/>she said, flipping through her pokedex until she found the desired<br/>picture."See, Geodude evolves into Graveller and Graveller evolves<br/>into Golem."<p>It did look a little more impressive, if still not able to strike fear<br/>in the hearts of men. I read through the listed attacks of the<br/>creature and decided I might as well go with the flow. Ami healed it<br/>from the beating Sparkles had given it and I stored it in a pokeball.<p>Ami made Sparkles go for an evening flight to stretch it's wings while<br/>we made like wild pokemons.<p>****<p>"I admit that me and Slammer(I let Ami name my Geodude) get along<br/>well, but there is no way I'm going to take that gimp fish." How such<br/>a lame pokemon could survive when surrounded by so many that were so<br/>much more powerful than it, I'll never know.<p>Ami sighed. Slammer had caught this one. She just seemed determined<br/>that I should keep it. She pulled out the pokedex and scanned through<br/>it for a couple minutes."This is what that gimp fish will evolve into<br/>after two more level gains."<p>The snake like dragon pokemon couldn't be the product of a Magicarp.<br/>I flipped to the Gyarados' preevolutionary form. It was a Magicarp.<br/>How could it gain so much mass in the short time that pokemon<br/>evolution takes?<p>"See the techniques," Ami pointed out."It learns some of the strongest<br/>and it can be taught almost any technique from other pokemon." For<br/>some reason Ami was determined that I had my own squad of powerful<br/>attack pokemon. I couldn't use them in a fight, not a serious one,<br/>and I wasn't obsessed with them like Minako and Makoto.<p>"Okay, you convinced me." I'm seeing a disturbing pattern arising.<p>"Good. It's getting late. Do you want to camp out again or head on<br/>into town?" I don't know if getting laid did it or if she was just<br/>growing up, but Ami's confidence was steadily building, both in<br/>dealing with me and the world in general.<p>"Camping's fine. We can stop by the gym in the morning and I can show<br/>how much better humans are than pokemon." That was my mission.<br/>Pokemon held too much value and humans too little on this world.<p>****<p>Back on Earth, Genma was introducing his 'son' to the Tendo family.<br/>Ryoga was taking the best way out of the situation that he could see.<br/>He was unconscious.<p>"He's just tired," Genma said. Underneath the table he was repeatedly<br/>pinching the imposter. He just wouldn't wake up.<p>"Oh, how you must have struggled to reach us at last," wailed Soun.<br/>His old friend and the future heir of the combined Saotome-Tendo<br/>schools of martial arts had been late. He had endured constant anger<br/>and mistreatment from his daughters because of his attempts to marry<br/>one of them off.<p>While the two old men exchanged small talk, Nabiki caught her sisters'<br/>attention and led them into the kitchen."That boy with Dad's friend is<br/>not Ranma Saotome," she whispered to them.<p>"How do you know, Nabiki?" Akane was the most offended by her father's<br/>stupid decision. For weeks she had been stewing on the problem and<br/>had decided to either disown her family or murder Ranma, if she was<br/>chosen to marry him.<p>"I didn't want to any of us to be engaged to a psychopath, so I had<br/>him checked out by a friend of mine at the Nerima Police Department.<br/>Ranma Saotome, son of Genma and Nodoka Satome, looks nothing like that<br/>weeny out there. The man we're supposed to be engaged to is some kind<br/>of government special agent with the Bureau of Intelligence."<p>"Then you mean that father's friend is trying to trick him?" Kasumi<br/>wondered aloud.<p>"That could be." Nabiki nodded."Or Dad could be going along with this<br/>whole scheme. If Ranma is important enough to be a government agent,<br/>he wouldn't have any problem convincing his father not to do something<br/>stupid like force him to marry a girl against his will."<p>"Those sneaky, baka bastards!" Akane shouted. There was no stopping<br/>the girl now. She charged into the parlor and grabbed Ryoga by the<br/>scruff of his neck and started shaking him roughly. Slowly, the boy<br/>regained consciousness."I know you're not Ranma!"<p>Ryoga's eyes filled with panic and began darting from side to side<br/>nervously."I don't know what your talk-" Genma didn't finish the<br/>statement. Akane tossed Ryoga into him, headfirst.<p>"Akane's right, Dad, the real Ranma Saotome doesn't even look like<br/>this guy. See." She held up a picture taken from Ranma's<br/>dossier."That's the real Ranma."<p>"Saotome," Soun wailed,"are they telling the truth?"<p>Genma had been edging towards the door, but a slight miscalculation<br/>had brought him up against the wall instead. He looked for any kind<br/>of help, but Ryoga had passed out again and no one was looking very<br/>sympathetic or pacifistic at the moment.<p>****<p>'And a newcomer to the world of pokemon competition, Usagi Tsuniko!'<br/>the announcer shouted after introducing the girl's opponent.<p>Usagi waved to the screaming crowd, soaking up the attention. Her<br/>opponent across from the battle ring stood on his platform looking<br/>impatient and annoyed. He hadn't gotten so much as a clap from the<br/>million people watching from within the enormous stadium.<p>'This battle will consist of three pokemon per trainer! Trainers<br/>ready?' Usagi and her opponent nodded.'Then let the battle begin!'<p>The entire stadium went dead quiet. In the silence that followed,<br/>Usagi shouted,"I choose you, Dandelion!" From the pokeball held in her<br/>hand, a massive Venusaur materialized.<p>Pedro, almost simultaneously announced,"George, I choose you!" A<br/>roaring Onix appeared.<p>In the front row, directly behind Usagi, Ami whispered,"Usagi's<br/>Dandelion has a major type advantage over Pedro's George. This match<br/>should be a snap."<p>I nodded agreement. Reluctantly, I had picked up a considerable<br/>amount of info on pokemon from Ami, her pokedex, and our temporary<br/>companion, Professor Oak. I looked down towards the battle that was<br/>about to begin. I felt sorry for Dandelion. What kind of stupid name<br/>was Dandelion for a giant plant monster?<p>"Dandelion, use your razor leaf attack!" commanded Usagi. From<br/>Dandelion's leafy back, sprayed hundreds of stiff, razor sharp leafs.<br/>George, that's another crappy name for such a huge pokemon, was too<br/>slow to avoid the attack and had pebble sized chunks taken out of<br/>almost every area of his rock body.<p>George wasn't totally defeated. Pedro ordered,"George, dig under<br/>Dandelion!" The giant rock snake dove into the air, only to come down<br/>like a bullet, burrowing his way underground. Dandelion began too<br/>look for a place to avoid the incoming attack, but as the ground<br/>started to shake beneath Usagi's pokemon it lost its footing and was<br/>hit full force by George's explosive resurfacing.<p>Dandelion didn't look nearly as hurt as George, though, and when next<br/>commanded to attack, its razor leafs sent the Onix into a dead faint.<p>The battles were pretty interesting, especially between the strong<br/>pokemon that just stood back and shot energy attacks at one another.<br/>Usagi won all of her battles for the day, working her way into the<br/>semifinals.<p>****<p>"Aren't my pokemon just the best?" Usagi cheered. Her pokemon really<br/>were some of the better ones on the field, at least as far as I had<br/>seen.<p>Along with Professor Oak and some family friends of his, including a<br/>boy who was competing against Usagi, we all headed to the Indigo<br/>Diner. Usagi wanted to go there because the food was served by<br/>pokemon. I just wanted something to eat. I think Ami was of my<br/>thinking on this one. The service and food was better than I had<br/>hoped.<p>The boy with the Professor, Ash I think, had his Pikachu out and was<br/>feeding it from the table.<p>"How's Pikachu doing, Ash?" asked Professor Oak.<p>"He's really excited about tomorrow. We're going to win for sure!"<p>Usagi butted in,"Not if I have anything to say about it!"<p>I convinced Ami to sneak away with me before Usagi started up the<br/>fireworks. We discreetly said our farewells to the Professor and<br/>Ash's mother before heading to the pokemon center/motel we were<br/>rooming in.<p>We were discussing something about the benefits of missionary versus<br/>doggie style when the watch uplink to my pokegear started beeping. I<br/>checked the indicator light. About time that stupid egg decided to<br/>hatch!<p>"Let's fly, Ranma!" Ami said."No one will see us as dark as it is."<p>I was more excited than I should have been, myself. Flying cut the<br/>trip down to less than a minute. I opened the door just in time to<br/>see the first large cracks appearing in the egg. I sat down next to<br/>it to watch, Ami holding my hand excitedly. For several minutes the<br/>egg didn't do much more than rock around and crack. It should have<br/>been a pile of dust with the number of fractures it was sporting, but<br/>it somehow maintained its shape.<p>When it did open, the shell fell away into dust like I had been<br/>expecting. The pokemon 'expanded' once out of its egg, because it was<br/>three times the size of the egg itself."What is it?" I asked Ami as I<br/>picked up little bat-winged monstrosity. It was about as high as my<br/>knees and covered in short, course black fur. From both of it hands<br/>and feet extended inch long claws that had the irridescent property of<br/>mother of pearl. It looked like a little baby demon.<p>Ami's pokedex came up with a big fat blank space. Looks like I have<br/>myself a new kind of pokemon."What are you going to name it?" Gender<br/>was another unknown.<p>I looked down at the little demonlike creature who was already asleep<br/>in my arms."Demon, I think. It has the look." I turned it so Ami<br/>could get a better look at it, carefully so as not to wake it. I hope<br/>this thing grows up fast. I don't like children much more than I like<br/>getting struck by lightning.<p>"Professor Oak's computers can probably determine what type it'll be<br/>and what would be best to feed it," Ami told me as I laid Demon on a<br/>sofa cushion. There's a thought. What if demons are the pokemon of<br/>my world?<p>****<p>Demon didn't stay in the cute phase for long. By the end of the next<br/>day he was as tall as my male form and had a fifteen foot wingspan.<br/>Those little claws were six inch long knives now. The Professor's<br/>computer did indeed determine Demon's type. He was a Dark/Fire type<br/>pokemon and it calculated that pokemon high in fiber would be the best<br/>meal it could eat for the next few weeks. I didn't want to have the<br/>local population of domestic pokemon wiped out, so Ami and I took it<br/>out to a nearby forest with some of those tree pokemon and turned it<br/>loose.<p>Truthfully, when it came back, Demon had grown over a foot. Heh, this<br/>joker was gonna be big.<p>****<p>Today was the last day of the League Championship. I zapped Demon<br/>into a pokeball and went to see Usagi compete. Ash and his mom had<br/>left earlier in the morning. He hadn't taken his lose to Usagi all<br/>that well.<p>'We're down to the final four trainers, ladies and gentlemen.' Like I<br/>needed the announcer to tell me that when the giant tv screen had the<br/>trainers' names and pictures on it. I ignored the next few minutes of<br/>cheering and drivel from the announcer. Ami tugged on my arm to get<br/>my attention and pointed to the arena.<p>Usagi was wearing a long, flowing dress of the same silver substance<br/>created by her white magic back on Ranma World when she had claimed<br/>Usagi City. Her opponent was a grizzled old man who leaned heavily on<br/>a gnarled wooded cane.<p>'Trainers, choose your strongest pokemon, for this will be a one match<br/>battle!'<p>Usagi and the old guy messed around with their belts, choosing the one<br/>pokemon they wished to use.<p>'Let the battle begin!'<p>"I choose you, Dragonite!" shouted old guy. Dragonites look kinda<br/>like Puff the magic dragon to me, so it's hard to take them seriously,<br/>but they're supposed to pack some real power.<p>"Go Zapdos!" The bird that flew from Usagi's pokeball looked like it<br/>was composed of chained lightning.<p>Ami was shocked."Usagi actually caught one of the legendary birds."<br/>She shook her head in suprise. These legendary birds must have been<br/>famous or something, even though I'd never heard of them, because the<br/>crowd went wild after a few moments of silence.<p>Usagi's electric bird didn't give the Dragonite much of a chance. As<br/>soon as the battle began, it unleashed a massive bolt of lightning at<br/>its opponent. It was an attack I would have been proud of. Poor<br/>Dragonite was still twitching as the team of fat little pokemon with<br/>egg pouches carried it away on a stretcher.<p>"I'd better go feed Demon," I told Ami."I should have plenty of time<br/>during intermission." I know that when in a pokeball a pokemon doesn't<br/>get hungry, but Demon was still young and I didn't want to stunt its<br/>growth.<p>****<p>Twelve feet tall, thirty foot wingspan, and foot long claws. Demon is<br/>going to live up to his name. I got back to my seat just in time to<br/>see an Onix get blasted by a geyser of water. Even I know not to put<br/>a rock pokemon up against a water one. It was down to Usagi and a boy<br/>named Jiro.<p>Once again I tuned out the announcer until the fight actually began.<p>Usagi sent out Dandelion and Jiro used a Charizard named Torch. Ouch,<br/>bad news for meatball head.<p>"Torch, let it have a taste of you fire blast attack!" Jiro commanded.<br/>From Torch's mouth exploded the kanji symbol for fire, in the form of<br/>a solid flame. Dandelion used its tentacle things to pull itself<br/>mostly out of the blast's path, but one side was badly singed and the<br/>pokemon was crying out in pain.<p>Usagi cried out to her pokemon,"Dandelion, hang in there, I'll save<br/>you!" I could feel the workings of a major white casting. Usagi<br/>raised her arms into the air. Arcs of golden energy leapt from hand<br/>to hand as Usagi chanted. A deep groaning hum feeled the air as Usagi<br/>pointed her hands, palms flattened, at Dandelion. A beam of gold and<br/>silver light shot from her hands and collided with Dandelion. The<br/>pokemon's wounds faded away in an instant and it was on its feet<br/>roaring.<p>"Use your solarbeam!" Usagi called to it.<p>The giant flower on Dandelion's back opened up and pointed towards<br/>Torch, who at Jiro's prompting had taken to the air in order to avoid<br/>the beam. The initial strike did miss, but Dandelion continued to<br/>power the beam and scythed it through the air. Torch couldn't<br/>maneuver fast enough and was hit in the back by the laser.<p>When the Charizard struck the ground it didn't move, the only sign<br/>that it still lived was the slow rise and fall of its barrel-like<br/>chest.<p>'Incredible folks, absolutely incredible! Never before have we seen<br/>such Trainer to Pokemon interaction, but the question is, will the<br/>judges disqualify Trainer Tsuniko for use of an unclaimed...pokemon<br/>healing ability.'<p>Silence.<p>'Yes, the judges have ruled in favor of Trainer Tsuniko! She is this<br/>year's Pokemon League Champion!'<p>****<p>I still hadn't trained Demon not to eat other people's pokemon, so he<br/>couldn't come to the party thrown in celebration of Usagi's victory.<p>The senshi of the day was glowing with pride and surrounded by her<br/>pokemon whom she continuously petted or praised. Minako and Makoto<br/>managed to get off of work to be at the celebration and were having<br/>their ears talked off by Usagi whenever she wasn't administering to<br/>her menagerie.<p>Nature called and I was about to answer, when I passed close enough to<br/>Usagi and her friends to hear some of their conversation.<p>"Can you believe it? I wonder who the father is." That was Makoto.<p>"I thought that her and Ranma were together, you know, like Haruka and<br/>Michiru," commented Usagi.<p>"Well obviously she isn't just a lesbian," Rei, with her super rat,<br/>snapped. Something was wrong. Very very wrong."She couldn't be if<br/>she's pregnant.<p>Pregnant. Ami. Pregnant. OH SHIT!<p>I don't remember much after that, because thankfully I fainted.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: It seemed like it would be fun to see Ami and this<br/>version of Ranma deal with parenthood. They all leave PokeWorld next<br/>chapter, too. C&amp;C welcome at dark_<p>
