</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 15<p>Hersh's brothers were in full battle armor when Demon dropped us off<br/>at the rocky clearing at the mouth of their cave. They must have been<br/>preparing to mount a rescue mission for Demon's latest catch. To<br/>their credit, the demons didn't even run away as Demon came into view.<br/>It was understandable, though, that they would draw their weapons and<br/>spread out into a loose formation that wouldn't hamper their ability<br/>to haul ass if the need arose.<p>Hersh sprinted to the pack leader, a tall black cat demon with shaggy<br/>black fur and a blood red chain mail shirt. They exchanged several<br/>hisses and growls, what passed for a language, I guess, then the big<br/>black demon slowly approached me, his three inch claws fully withdrawn<br/>in a show of peace.<p>He bowed his head slightly and said,"We are at your ssservice, Lord<br/>Ranma." Well, this was just getting better and better. The guy was at<br/>least seven feet tall and out massed me by a good fifty kilograms, but<br/>he hadn't attempted to challenge my status as interim leader.<p>We exchanged pleasantries, a few old war stories, and finally got down<br/>to business. I informed the leader of the coming escape attempt and<br/>invited him and his brothers to join us. The same no harming the<br/>girls policy was in effect, and they couldn't bother the pokemon, for<br/>their own health.<p>"I'm going to have to go ahead of you and smooth things over with the<br/>girls," I told Squirm, the pack leader. I won't even begin to<br/>elaborate on how he got that nickname."They're the Sailor Senshi and<br/>don't really like demons too much. I have a lot of influence over<br/>them, though, so just behave and they'll leave you and your brothers<br/>alone." The pack of demons had been getting their gear together while<br/>we talked and they all waited at the cave mouth for further<br/>instructions.<p>Squirm didn't like fraternizing with the enemy much at all. He was an<br/>intelligent demon, though, and saw that there was little alternative,<br/>and besides, he had to obey my every command."I'm gonna leave Slammer<br/>behind. He's a sort of rock demon and will be able to lead you and<br/>your packmates to my camp."<p>I unpacked my Golem and gave him his marching orders. He nodded, as<br/>much as a semi-rigid boulder can nod, and walked over to look at the<br/>demons. He'd never seen real ones before so he was curious. The cat<br/>demons obviously respected, or at least feared Slammer, lowering their<br/>eyes whenever his gaze met theirs.<p>****<p>No one was happy, especially Telerin, when I made my announcement.<br/>Rei the most vocal of all, threatened to unlease Ratty on the demons<br/>if they got within a mile of her. I had to laugh as that comment, I<br/>couldn't help it, sending the temple maiden off in a huff of rage. I<br/>ignored Telerin, his face a pale as a ghost. He would just have to<br/>deal with it or he could go home.<p>"Ranma, it's too dangerous to bring that many demons here," insisted<br/>Makoto. I knew otherwise. The demons were all weak and fading faster<br/>by the day. Makoto's meager martial arts skill could probably have<br/>allowed her to take out a half dozen of the felines before they<br/>swarmed her. With the pokemon, no worries.<p>"Don't sweat it," I retorted."They're weak and we have all these<br/>pokemon, including Demon," that's saying a lot,"and myself. If by<br/>some freak occurence of nature, the demons did turn on us, they<br/>wouldn't live to regret it. That's not a problem, though. These are<br/>servants of a friend of mine. They sorta know of me by reputation and<br/>will obey my every command." It took a little more insisting on the<br/>girls' part, and a lot of begging to get Ami to have anything to do<br/>with me that night, a man can get used to certain things after a<br/>while, but they eventually conceded to give my 'friends' a chance.<p>Slammer, a long line of cat demons trailing behind, arrived at the<br/>trampled down area of grass that I like to think of as home. The<br/>giant rock had a little spring in his step and a twinkle in his<br/>diamond coated eye. I decided to let him stay out in the open for a<br/>while. Being out of his pokeball was doing him a lot of good. I'd<br/>let Gyrados out later and let him have a few days to relax in the<br/>river and gorge himself on fish.<p>Squirm sought me out immediately. He was most impressed by Slammer's<br/>destructive abilities and wished to know where he could get one of his<br/>own. I told him I didn't know the exact planar coordinates, but did<br/>give him a general idea of where PokeWorld was. If they ever do run<br/>across PokeWorld, the demons are probably going to have more trouble<br/>not getting caught as pokemon than anything else.<p>I was going to have to have a talk with Slammer and find out how<br/>Squirm knew of his pokemon powers."Get you brothers settled in and<br/>I'll introduce you to the girls." They were waiting for an all clear<br/>signal a couple kilometers into the grass. The precaution had been<br/>mostly for Telerin's sake. The girls just went along to make sure the<br/>guy didn't do anything stupid.<p>****<p>"This will help me to find Ranma?" Shampoo asked. In her hand she<br/>held a large glass bead slightly larger than her thumb. From within<br/>the trasparent bead, faint pulses of light, yellow and green, came<br/>intermitently and it gave of an soft warmth.<p>"Yes, child. Once you leave the confines of this valley and its<br/>various mystic wards, the Orb will guide your to Ranma Saotome. Trust<br/>your instincts because they are what the Orb works with. You have a<br/>month," finished Cologne. They both knew what happened in a month.<br/>The first attacks would begin in a few days, but they would be night<br/>raids, carried out in secret and designed to destroy supply and ammo<br/>dumps so that when Saffron's artifact was put into use, its effects<br/>would be magnified by the internal chaos already present within the<br/>Chinese Republican Army. A month and the crystal egg would be<br/>shattered, throwing the Earth into an artificial, century long dark<br/>age.<p>"I won't fail, great-grandmother," assured Shampoo. Across her back,<br/>its pommel covered to conceal the burning light within the giant ruby<br/>and the ruby itself, rested Ranma's sword. Shampoo's status had<br/>increased enormously thanks to her prowess with the magical blade and<br/>her ability to summon and control winds greater than even her great-<br/>grandmother.<p>"Be well then and return safely," Cologne said in parting. She took<br/>to her staff and was gone from Shampoo's sensory range within moments.<p>"Well Shampoo old girl, your finally out on your own," the young<br/>warrior commented to herself. The narrow mountain pass that led into<br/>China proper, wasn't far ahead and if she pushed herself, she would be<br/>able to reach it before nightfall.<p>****<p>Shampoo found Mousse waiting for her as she reached the almost<br/>unnoticeable crevice formed by a fault in the surrounding mountains<br/>that led into China. The Hidden Weapons Master had always been more<br/>of a nuisance than a friend, especially during the short time that<br/>Ranma had stayed with the tribe. Ranma had done something to the boy,<br/>though, fixed his eyes with magic. From then on, Mousse had been like<br/>love starved puppy, following Ranma around the village constantly. He<br/>hadn't even taken offense when it became public knowledge that Shampoo<br/>had been bedding the foreign sorceror.<p>Once Ranma left, though, Mousse had returned his full attention to<br/>Shampoo. She couldn't even deny forming a relationship with him<br/>because of his poor eye sight, not since Ranma fixed it. Not only was<br/>he persistent, Mousse was also a skilled warrior, a very skilled<br/>warrior when his eye sight improved. Shampoo had worried that Mousse<br/>would challenge her for marriage and quite possibly win the fight.<br/>That hadn't happened. Now what was the young man doing?<p>"Shampoo, is it true that you leave to seek Ranma?" Mousse asked, his<br/>voice was oddly serious, none of its normal obsequiousness present.<p>"Yes. Great-grandmother and Council of Elders wish to bring Ranma to<br/>our side before the war starts. He is a powerful sorceror and warrior<br/>who would give the Amazon Nation several advantages." Shampoo feared<br/>that Mousse may have chosen this time to challenge her, thereby<br/>delaying her mission to find Ranma to the point where to attempt it<br/>would be useless.<p>Mousse nodded and stood, taking his weight off the rock wall."I shall<br/>accompany you, then." The former blind boy had a canvas travelling<br/>pack at his side. The only reason he wouldn't keep it in the warped<br/>space within his robes where he stored his weapons was if it contained<br/>food, something which spoiled quickly in the unstable space.<p>"Mousse," Shampoo warned,"Ranma is a powerful warrior-"<p>Mousse interrupted,"And nearly invincible as a sorceror. I know that,<br/>Shampoo, and I have no wish to harm him. I owe Ranma more than you<br/>can imagine and if my aide will bring him to the safety of the village<br/>before the war throws the world into chaos, then I would risk my life<br/>to see it through." He spoke as a warrior, one of the greatest in the<br/>village, not as a love starved freak. Shampoo nodded, and silently,<br/>they passed from Jusendo, a tiny refuge of magic and martial arts, to<br/>China, the sprawling and overcrowded nation that would soon learn to<br/>fear the Amazons of old.<p>****<p>Haruka and Michiru, lesbian senshi extraordinaire, were shopping at an<br/>adult book store, very discreetly, when something exploded outside,<br/>throwing chunks of shrapnel and asphault through the blacked-out<br/>windows of the store. Haruka threw down the double dildo she had been<br/>examining and reflexively dived for Michiru, knocking the girl out of<br/>the path of a burning rubber women.<p>"We've got to transform!" Michiru shouted over the clamour. Haruka<br/>nodded her agreement and they pulled out their henshin rods. A few<br/>seconds later, Sailor Neptune and Uranus were in the street. The<br/>pedestrians of Juuban, by now well aware of the daily threat posed by<br/>exploding objects and energy hungry creatures from other dimensions,<br/>had cleared the area in record time.<p>Warily, the duo approached the large crater that had formed in the<br/>center of the four-lane street. The flying debris had stopped flying<br/>by now, and they could easily see the metallic sphere that rested<br/>within the crater. What was it? An invader from beyond? Martians?<p>The sphere split in half like an egg and the two senshi gasped at what<br/>they saw. Another senshi. Her fuku was silver, to match her shiny<br/>silver hair, and the bows and body suit were a mixture of blue and<br/>black. The woman stood up, stretching regally, and her face became<br/>clear to the senshi. Wow, she was hot! And she sorta looked like<br/>Setsuna.<p>"You two," the new senshi snapped, finally opening her eyes,"what has<br/>my bratty little sister screwed up now?" She rose from the crater,<br/>floated over the bubbling asphault at the edge of the crater, and<br/>landed lightly beside Uranus and Neptune.<p>Haruka and Michiru didn't answer immediately, too busy oggling the new<br/>arrival. Finally, Michiru got enough sense back to ask,"W-who's your<br/>sister?" She knew the question was a waste of breath. This woman's<br/>sister absolutely had to Setsuna.<p>The senshi rolled her eyes."Setsuna Meiou, Sailor Pluto, Guardian of<br/>the Time portion of the Gates of Time and Space(um, hey Carrot, got<br/>that idea from Insertion, just now catching up on it and hope you<br/>don't mind)," she answered. Setsuna's sister gestured with her left<br/>hand and a smooth shaft of unadorned metal appeared in the air above<br/>her. She snatched the object from the air and said,"Nevermind. Since<br/>you two halfwits can't stop staring at my breasts, I'll just have to<br/>see for myself." The Senshi of Space rapped the end of her staff on<br/>the ground and a hole of the purest black appeared beneath the three<br/>senshi.<p>****<p>Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus clung to each other in gibbering<br/>terror as they slowly rose from the floor, alongside the Senshi of<br/>Space. They were in the general vicinity of the Time Gates, as<br/>indicated by the eerie lack of natural light and the perpetual<br/>waterless mist that covered everything.<p>"She never was very original," Setsuna's sister said. With a wave of<br/>her arm the mists parted and the three senshi got an eyeful of<br/>Setsuna, now about three hundred and fifty pounds heavier than the<br/>last time they had seen her, shooting up a hit of heroine. The<br/>garbage surrounding the Senshi of Time's sofa, if that's what the<br/>thing was, had reached near mountainous proportions and absolutely<br/>reeked.<p>"By the All Mighty's Sacred Jewels!" the new senshi roared."Setsuna,<br/>what in Hell happened to you?" She began pointing her staff at<br/>garbage heaps, causing each one to disappear into nothingness,<br/>followed shortly by the tv, refridgerator, and the sofa that sumo-<br/>Setsuna had been occupying.<p>Setsuna fell to the floor with a squeal not unlike that of a stuck<br/>pig, and looked at her three guests in illdisguised horror. She<br/>stared at her sister for about three seconds, then covered her grimy<br/>face with equally grimy hands and began crying softly.<p>"Ah geeze, little sister, you know how long it took you to lose all<br/>the weight last time," sighed the Senshi of Space. She turned to the<br/>other two senshi and said,"Here, have fun." She waved her staff and<br/>another hole opened beneath the girls, swallowing them into the void.<p>"Oh, Katya, it's so horrible, I..." And Setsuna launched into a full<br/>recounting of everything that had happened since she'd contacted<br/>Ranma, leaving out only some of the more embarassing curses."And now<br/>they're gone, gone from the time stream as if they never existed!" she<br/>wailed as a closing to the story.<p>Katya shook her head and chuckled."Little sister, leave it to you to<br/>never consider the obvious." Setsuna had always been a brilliant<br/>child, and so Temporally grounded that the Time currents couldn't even<br/>hope to effect her, but she was stubborn, short-sighted, and as<br/>arrogant as any ten queens.<p>"How can you laugh about this?" Setsuna whined."The senshi and the<br/>Princess are gone! Crystal Tokyo will never be! All is lost!<br/>Wah!" Katya patted her distressed sibling on her back, lightly so<br/>as not to get anything of questionable sanitary origin on her gloves.<p>"If the girls are not within your domain, then they are within mine,"<br/>Katya answered."Ranma, from your description, could likely open a<br/>dimensional portal. If he was as powerful as you say, and was<br/>attempting to close a breached tomb, he could easily have misdirected<br/>some of that energy and unwittingly opened a portal to another plane."<br/>The fact that her sister hadn't even considered this possibility was a<br/>good enough reason for Katya to believe Setsuna was in serious need of<br/>a vacation. The roundabout attempt on Ranma's life while he was<br/>nothing but a child said that her little sister needed psychiatric<br/>help.<p>What was really bad about the situation, though, was that Ranma was<br/>probably innocent of trying to corrupt the senshi. He might have been<br/>a little rough around the edges, thanks to his demonic upbringing, but<br/>he'd been relatively civil and his instruction of the senshi had been<br/>top rate, even going so far as finding the princess's mindblock and<br/>having it removed. The curses may have been a little over the top,<br/>but Setsuna had deserved it, sorta. You just don't manipulate someone<br/>into a situation where they have to change genders to fulfill a blood<br/>pact.<p>Setsuna looked up, hope lighting her eyes from within. The tears she<br/>had shed made oily tracks in the dirt and bits of food that covered<br/>her face.<p>****<p>"Okay, you and your brothers can have the guards," I told Squirm.<br/>"Just don't let the senshi hear them scream, okay?" Squirm nodded<br/>eagerly."They get kinda offended by that kind of thing." Not that I<br/>liked the idea, but some of the cat demons were at the point of<br/>starvation, and when a being has to eat, it has to eat. There were no<br/>alternatives.<p>Ami and the other senshi were turning the enormous combination lock<br/>into a position that would free up enough energy for us to escape to<br/>our home. The hundred and forty-nine metal disks had to be perfectly<br/>aligned and it was taking time. Telerin, careful not to look directly<br/>at any of the demons that were now quietly streaming into the streets<br/>of Chicago to feast on the incapacitated guards, walked over to me and<br/>said,"There are only three disks left to align. Ami says that you<br/>should be able to begin gathering energy in less than a minute."<p>I nodded and stepped into the ring of light generated by one of the<br/>spell constructs that hung from enormous chains embedded in the<br/>temple's ceiling. I wasn't taking any chances. I had the Silver<br/>Imperium Crystal in my pocket and was going to use the first of the<br/>energy I absorbed to key the crystal into my aura. If I'd done that<br/>sooner, we wouldn't have been in this mess.<p>"All right, Ranma!" Makoto shouted. I felt as much as heard the<br/>metallic click emitted by the key structure. The crystal above me,<br/>glowing blue and white, suddenly began to pulse and the energy began<br/>to flow. I sucked the energy from the air as fast as it was produced,<br/>all the while keying Usagi's crystal for my use.<p>My energy capacitance is vast, and with it completely drained, I took<br/>almost two minutes to reach my storage limit. I signalled to the<br/>senshi and stepped out of the beam of raw, concentrated energy. Usagi<br/>was the next to bathe in the flow. I didn't see who came after her,<br/>since I ran out to Squirm and said,"Get your spell-casters cleaned up<br/>and I'll take them to recharge."<p>The three demons that followed me into the temple were old for their<br/>species and one of them had the mange, I think. Ami was just stepping<br/>out of the beam of energy as we entered. I had the demon sorcerors to<br/>wait for Rei once Ami was finished then gave them the go ahead.<p>They didn't take but a few seconds each, not because any of them were<br/>particularly weak, but because all demons naturally learn spells as<br/>they age and such natural magic is very efficient. For these three to<br/>be able to travel dimensionally, they had to be 'old'.<p>****<p>"Tell Xochial that I may pay him a visit sometime soon, now that I've<br/>got this planar travel thing worked out," I said to Squirm. He and<br/>his fellow demons were travelling back to their master's realm and I<br/>didn't think the girls, or myself, much cared to see the ritual that<br/>would open the protal they would use.<p>"Squirm owess hisss life and that of his packmatess to Ranma and hisss<br/>femalesss. If you ever need my help, the Master'sss blade will call<br/>me. Farewell." I shook the demon's hand and jogged over to Demon. My<br/>enormous pokemon was lazily chewing on a car sized boulder when I<br/>arrived. He swallowed his midday snack hurriedly, and held his hand<br/>out to me.<p>****<p>"You sure?" I asked. Telerin was dead set on coming with us. I<br/>didn't mind really, but I had some concerns about his ability to adapt<br/>to a culture so unlike that of Chicago.<p>Telerin nodded."My life here is not anything special. I would much<br/>rather travel to your world and learn of my ancestors." I had to agree<br/>with him. His life really had sucked here on this backward Earth.<p>"You'll have to get a job," I told him. He shrugged."Well, I guess<br/>you can stay with me, if the apartment is still mine." I really<br/>doubted that one. Then again, time flows differently between<br/>universes. We could arrive at home and find that three seconds has<br/>gone by, or just as likely have missed three thousand years. Oh well,<br/>anything was better than this shit hole.<p>The preparations had been made and I'd gotten a serviceable mirror<br/>from one of Squirm's sorcerors, so we would be leaving soon. I'd<br/>absorbed and magically linked my crystal and Usagi's(it mine now, ha<br/>ha ha) and absorbed them into my body. Hey, it may be paranoid, but<br/>Setsuna's abilities aren't fully known to me and she could have<br/>figured out when we would be returning. I was just making sure I was<br/>prepared to defend against anything she could possibly throw at me.<p>"I just know Mom will love you," Ami said as she came up behind<br/>me."She may try to claw your eyes out for a few minutes, but once<br/>she's calmed down, we'll be able to explain things to her and<br/>everything will be fine" Oh great, very reassuring.<p>"That's nice," I lied. I knew she knew it. It's not like I had ever<br/>expected to have to meet the parents of the girl I'd been screwing for<br/>the last few months. I felt Ami's ire rise and began thinking happy<br/>thoughts and some more naughty ones. Whew, disaster averted.<p>"And I arranged this one special, just for Shingo," Usagi was saying<br/>to Minako."It's a Charmander egg. Won't he just love that?" Oh crap.<br/>She was already making plans. Her brother would probably blow up<br/>their house or something if he had a fire pokemon. You can't expect a<br/>child to act responsibly when he has access to a living weapon of<br/>destruction.<p>"Shingo is a good kid," Ami commented after reading my thought."He<br/>might burn the carpet a little, but that's about it." We shared a<br/>laugh and went about gathering senshi for the trip home.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: I said they would be going home this chapter, sorry,<br/>plans sorta changed. They'll be arriving back on Earth at the<br/>beginning of the next, though, and that's when the shit's gonna hit<br/>tha fan. What side will Ranma and the senshi take in the coming war?<br/>I'm not sure yet. Will Setsuna regain her figure? Maybe in a decade<br/>or three. Anyway, C&amp;C on how to proceed from here on would be nice.<br/>E-mails that just tell me that you like the story and hope I write<br/>more of it are cool, and they do fuel my ego just a bit, everybody<br/>likes to be praised, but real input is what I need now.<p>C&amp;C me at dark_<p>Later!<p>
