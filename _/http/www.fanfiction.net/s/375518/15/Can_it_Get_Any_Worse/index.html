</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 14<p>Cologne's eyes narrowed as she examined the blue crystalline egg that<br/>Saffron had produced. Though not a sorceress herself, Cologne could<br/>feel the magical energy bound into the egg, layers upon layers of<br/>intricately woven force. The entire crystal was energy, energy given<br/>form and purpose, but energy nonetheless. What that purpose was<br/>remained a mystery."How is this object supposed to aide us in the<br/>coming war?" It would have to be something similar to the hand of the<br/>Goddess coming down to smite their foes, otherwise their superior<br/>skill and power would be totally overrun by sheer numbers and the<br/>amount of machinery that the Chinese and other world governments could<br/>throw at them.<p>Saffron's voice was respectful as he addressed the ancient Amazon. He<br/>may be an immortal demi-kami, but that little old lady could very<br/>likely hold her own against him."It is a simple tool from the long<br/>dead Silver Millenium. One was placed on each inhabited world and<br/>through a series of spells that I am unfamiliar with, negated all<br/>artificial electricity and suppressed all chemical reactions explosive<br/>enough to power a projectile. These crystals kept the ruling family<br/>and its allies in power for more than a millenium, suppressing any<br/>development of technology that may have eventually challenged their<br/>power."<p>Herb, the young Dragon Prince of the Musk Dynasty, said,"This single<br/>crystal, it will render all modern technology useless?" The situation<br/>was almost too good to be true. When the only thing that can possibly<br/>win you the war shows up right when you need it most, something isn't<br/>right.<p>Cologne understood just how 'not right' things could quickly become.<br/>"Saffron, if I may be frank, why would you seek an alliance with my<br/>people and the Musk?"<p>Saffron chuckled."I understand my peoples' strengths and weaknesses<br/>better than anyone. We have greater numbers than either of your<br/>peoples combined, a greater range of mobility due to our wings, and a<br/>higher ratio of magic weilders. Even with my power, great as it may<br/>be, combined with the nullifying effects of the crystal, there would<br/>be very little chance of a succesful military campaign within China,<br/>muchless the entire world. Your Musk, Herb, are all possessed of<br/>extraordinary abilities, some of which allow them to fight foes with<br/>much greater skill than themselves and still emerge victorious. Your<br/>power, too, is nothing to be frowned upon. The Dragon blood runs<br/>strong within your veins." Saffron turned to look at the<br/>Matriarch."The skills, powers, and magical weapons of your tribe may<br/>be the greatest advantage of all, though, honored elder. Your fellow<br/>Amazon leaders are each near the equal of Herb, and you may be my<br/>eqaul, if for a short time. Together we shall be unstoppable."<p>Cologne saw the logic in the abbreviated explanation, but asked the<br/>relevant question."And who shall lead this new Jusendo Alliance?"<p>"I shall, of course," Saffron answered.<p>****<p>We'd reached the point in our research that for a significant amount<br/>of recorded history, no hard copies existed. A metal bin filled with<br/>tiny ceramic disks, discovered by Minako as we searched for the<br/>missing documents, had turned out to be some kind of back-up database<br/>and Ami's computer was running around the clock to decode the<br/>information. This break in activity allowed the senshi and I, with<br/>Telerin tagging along, though not really wishing to, to explore our<br/>temporary home in more detail.<p>Maps found in the Archive had helped tremendously in locating our<br/>general location on this Earth. The river that cuts through the giant<br/>field of grass, that's the amazon river. Yep, the one and only, the<br/>river that was 'supposed' to flow through the rain forests of South<br/>America. That was all gone, though, thanks to a mutated strain of<br/>bole weevil introduced to the continent by ecological terrorists.<br/>What they were hoping to accomplish besides destroying all kinds of<br/>potential cancer cures and eliminating a very large oxygen factory, I<br/>don't know.<p>"Earth, your's, not mine, is similar to that of my Earth's past?"<br/>Telerin asked late one evening. He was really starting to integrate<br/>into our little group, so much so that I had observed him playing with<br/>some of the pokemon, the idea of which would have sent the man off<br/>screaming like a frightened child. He'd also participated in a few of<br/>the sporadic martial arts lessons I was forcing on the senshi.<p>"Yeah," I confirmed."I can't really be too sure about some stuff,<br/>mostly because the time differences are still to great, but the<br/>geography and general culture appear to be an almost exact match. The<br/>differences were most likely small and insignificant. That's why it's<br/>hard to believe that a planet that was practically covered with humans<br/>and all the things we like to have around us, cars, building, etc.,<br/>would go down the hole like this one." Weeks of looking for some tiny<br/>remnant of civilization had turned up completely zilch. I would have<br/>been happy to find an old rusty spoon.<p>Telerin turned a little defensive thanks to my last comment."Chicago<br/>may not be terribly civilized to you, Ranma, but it's all we have and<br/>when you come right down to the point, the last home of humans on this<br/>entire planet. Our way has helped us to survive for millenia and<br/>we'll continue to do so."<p>I waved my hands around, trying to head of any argument."Look, Chicago<br/>is nice, sorta, but the Chicago I know on my Earth would completely<br/>overwhelm you. The thing that upsets me, though, is that the Archives<br/>have plans and instructions for the building and operating of most<br/>advanced technology. If you and your fellow Chicagotians(big shrug,<br/>good enough) had just tried, the whole place could have been a<br/>paradise when compared to its current state."<p>The older man seemed to slump, withdrawing within himself."I know. I<br/>too have seen the knowledge you speak of, and I know what we are<br/>missing out on, but what can I do about it?"<p>I shrugged and let that conversation lapse into silence. No sense in<br/>making the guy any more depressed than he already was. The ground<br/>beneath my feet shook slightly and I looked over to where Slammer was<br/>trying to teach Minoko's Geodude, a poor pokemon named Darling, how to<br/>create small earthquakes. My Golem noticed my attention and waved one<br/>of his massive stone arms in my direction. I returned the gesture and<br/>went looking for something to do.<p>Something found me, in the form of Ami and Rei. They were both<br/>breating hard and their faces were flushed with excitement and<br/>exertion."Ranma," Rei called, waving her arms to get my attention.<p>I jogged over to the girls, giving them time to catch their breath.<br/>"Trouble?" I asked. I'm gonna have to get one of those wrist radios<br/>whenever we get home, or the senshi were going to run themselves<br/>ragged getting in touch with me.<p>Ami shook her head and began,"The Chancy we left at the camp with my<br/>computer and the disks, it signalled that my computer has found a<br/>match to the parameters I set it to scan for." She smiled at me, in<br/>triumph mostly, but the gleam in her eye told me there was more to it<br/>than that. She's mentioned introducing me to her mother a few times<br/>in the last week. I think that was somehow involved.<p>"I just know that Grandfather is worried sick about me," Rei said."The<br/>others are out gathering their pokemon together now." Her hand went to<br/>her belt where a lonesome pokeball hung. Usagi has three eggs<br/>produced by her horde. Hopefully the princess will give those first<br/>few to Rei. The girl was just a little 'too' attached to her rat.<p>"Couldn't Chancy be in trouble and calling for help?" I asked,<br/>unwilling to get everyone's hopes up for nothing.<p>Ami shook her head."No, she didn't look worried on the communicator<br/>and she was waving my computer around and pointing at the indicator<br/>light," clarified the Senshi of Mercury. Even the pokemon get<br/>communicators. It's not fair. Eh, probably can't get tv signals<br/>anyway.<p>"If we fly in spurts, allowing the pokemon to rest for short periods<br/>of time, we should be able to get back in a couple of days," I said.<br/>I was much more eager to get back and get the information needed to<br/>get us home than I let myself show. I suppose Ami could feel the<br/>restrained excitement, but their was no holping that, now. Without<br/>the power of magic coursing through my body like I had become<br/>accustommed to over the years, a part of my being felt withered,<br/>nearly dead. This world was getting to me.<p>****<p>Usagi flung her arms around the rotund little Chancy, picking it up<br/>and twirling it though the air."Thank you so much, Cinderella!" she<br/>exclaimed happily. Every one of her pokemon had crappy names like<br/>that. They didn't mind, though, so I never said anything about it.<p>"Do you recognize this?" Ami asked Telerin, pointing to the floating<br/>3D image generated by her computer. The device was round and made of<br/>a series of metal disks, each lessening size as they neared the<br/>pointed top. It slowly turned on an invisible axis, giving full view<br/>of the symbols carved in its shining surface.<p>Telerin nodded, a look of forboding coming across his face."It's<br/>embedded in the Altar of the Wings, in the main temple. That temple<br/>is guarded constantly, day and night, ever since an attempted break-in<br/>over a centruy ago."<p>I shrugged that little inconvenience aside."Well, what are we waiting<br/>for? Let's go turn the dial, or whatever it is we have to do, and get<br/>our asses home," I suggested.<p>"It's not as simple as that, Ranma," Ami objected."The key sequence,<br/>due to the immense number of possible combinations, is going to take<br/>my computer days, if not weeks to decipher." I knew she regretted the<br/>words, that didn't make me any happier.<p>"We've waited this long, a few days won't matter."<p>****<p>Cologne reported the development back to the Council as soon as<br/>possible. They weren't happy about the demands, but they saw that to<br/>decline the offer would be foolish. Saffron would be in charge of the<br/>war to come, and he and his people would hold Asia and Europe at its<br/>completion. Herb had been furious and nearly to the point of throwing<br/>a royal temper tantrum, good sense won the day, though, and he finally<br/>agreed to take North America. The Amazon Nation would have plenty of<br/>resources and room to expand in South America and Africa. Jusendo,<br/>though, would retain its original borders and the areas controlled by<br/>each people would stay intact.<p>Cologne and the other Elders didn't expect reace to last long between<br/>the three factions once the war was over, but that situation would<br/>have to be attended to at a later date. A much later date. They were<br/>looking at several decades of genocide as it was, therewas no need to<br/>plan for more.<p>Leaving the Council Chamber that night, Cologne passed the training<br/>field where the first group of warriors that would soon be departing<br/>practiced. Her great-granddaughter stood far apart from the others,<br/>the mystic sword created by Ranma held before her. Cologne stopped to<br/>watch her heir.<p>Shampoo's face tightened and a mask of concentration slipped across<br/>it. Then, in a blur, the girl's arm whipped out, passing the sword<br/>through the air several times, all the while alternating its blade<br/>from hot to cold. In a handful of moments a gale force wind erupted<br/>in front of the Amazon, followed almost immediately by a cyclone that<br/>grew from a pencil thin mass of swirling air, to a three foot wide<br/>conflaguration. With deft movements, Shampoo directed the cyclone,<br/>forcing it to slowly lower itself until the deadly attack was<br/>paralledl with the ground.<p>Sweat soaked and panting, Shampoo halted the continuous amaguriken<br/>speed sword strokes, causing the cyclone to rapidly dissipate.<br/>Whistles and cheers greeted the young warrior, courtest of her<br/>fellows. With a smile, Cologne departed. She knew that her great-<br/>granddaughter could just as easily have created a tornado a hundred<br/>times that size.<p>At her doorstep, a thought struck her. If they could find Ranma and<br/>enlist his aide, his weapons alone could end the coming conflict years<br/>sooner. His repore(spelling is wrong, I know, but I don't feel like<br/>using the spellchecker) with demons, abominable as the creatures were,<br/>could also prove extremely valuable.<p>Maybe she should send Shampoo on a separate mission. She and Ranma<br/>had been close during his stay in the village and the relationship, as<br/>one sided as it had been, was a close enough link, that the girl could<br/>successfully scry him.<p>****<p>Demon came flying into the camp, well as close as something his size<br/>can manage, early the second morning after we had returned at<br/>Darling's request. The giant pokemon had finally ceased growing, at<br/>least noticeably, and had even learned to drain the life and energy<br/>from the surrounding grassland, sharply reducing his daily food<br/>intake.<p>Today, however, he had something large and furry clasped in his<br/>enormous fist. As he lumbered to me, I caught sight of a yellow<br/>furred head, a head belong to a species of feline demon that I had<br/>once had a run in with. Demon dropped the groaning demon at my feet<br/>and said,"No anmaal." He gently nudged it with his foot, the claws<br/>thankfully sheathed."Likez prrrsun." With a shrug of massive<br/>shoulders, he hunched down and waited for my examination.<p>I guess he wanted me to tell him whether he could eat the thing. I<br/>looked up at him and said,"Sorry, buddy, but these aren't food." He<br/>looked regretful and was about to go hunt, mostly for fun, when I<br/>asked,"Did you see any more like this?"<p>Demon nodded."Thhot wrayy," he said, pointing south, toward the<br/>forest. I'll be damned, demons, here. Telerin'd told me that there<br/>hadn't been a demon sighting in over a millenium. I jumped up, barely<br/>reaching Demon's shoulde,r and scratched him behind his ear. His purr<br/>made the ground tremble.<p>"You did good, Demon. Let's wake this guy up and see what he has to<br/>say for himself." I retrieved a bucket of water from the river and<br/>poured it on the demon. We didn't hae anything that could properly<br/>bind a creature of its physical strength, not that Demon nor I would<br/>have any trouble with this pathetic creature.<p>Cats don't like getting wet, and this one wasn't an exception. It<br/>came awake with a YOWL, which promptly became a scream of bestial fear<br/>when the first sight it saw was Demon, sitting cross-legged with his<br/>chin resting in the palms of his hands. I reached over and grabbed<br/>the demon's shoulder, careful not to badly startle it and possibly<br/>lose my arm.<p>"Don't worry, he won't hurt you," I told the demon. It turned around<br/>and was hit full force by my demonic prescence. Most demons of this<br/>species would have positively delighted in torturing me for days, but<br/>this one just grinned and extended its furry hand. He probably<br/>thought I was a shapeshifter in human form.<p>"That'sss one hell of a pet you got there," it commented. He swept an<br/>appreciative glance over Demon now that he knew the larger than life<br/>pokemon wouldn't attack him.<p>"It's more of a mentor/child relationship," I shrugged."Anyway, what<br/>in Hell are you doing on this piece of shit world?" Demons are by<br/>their nature innately magic, so even being on a magically deviant<br/>world like this one would be painful and over time, debilitating.<p>It growled."My brothersss and I were trapped here nearly a full moon<br/>ago. And you?" I could see a few patches of fur that had begun to<br/>become discolored and others where the fur was thinning and would soon<br/>fall out completely. Staying here was hitting this guy harder than I<br/>would have expected.<p>"My friends and I were transported to another plane. In attempting to<br/>reach our home, we have become trapped here. We may have found a way<br/>to unlock the spell that keeps our magic bound and will soon be<br/>travelling home. You and your brothers are welcome to replenish your<br/>energy if we succeed," I told him. The girls probably wouldn't like it,<br/>especially since these weren't the kinds of demons that minded their<br/>own business and worked nine to five jobs. Speaking of the girls."My<br/>friends are all human, and female, by the way. Don't get any ideas,<br/>though," I warned."Blood magic won't work here any better than any other<br/>kind, and if one of them were harmed, well that would be bad for your<br/>entire race."<p>It bowed, not even attempting to dispute my demands. It's not hard to<br/>see why the demons that come to this Earth always try to attack<br/>Chicago. Eventually they must feel the forces centered around the<br/>floating city and attempt to seize it, for their very survival. Oh<br/>boy, Telerin wasn't going to like this. Maybe I could pass the demons<br/>off as pokemon...<p>****<p>The girls hadn't got back from their dip in the river by the time that<br/>the demon, whom I now know to be named Hersh, and I, via Demon,<br/>departed for the cave that Hersh's fellow demons were living in.<p>"So, who's the Demon Lord on your plane?" I asked. FYI, that's always<br/>a good question to break the ice with the denizens of Hell.<p>"Xochial," Hersh answered."He isn't going to be happy that we have<br/>been gone so long." Xochial is one of the first demons to ever teach<br/>me any magic and he is the original owner of the athame I now use. I<br/>hadn't seen him in a few years.<p>"How is Xochial doing?" I asked. Demon Lords can travel between<br/>dimensions pretty easily thanks to the thin barriers between realities<br/>that exist within Hell. Every dimension has a single Demon Lord as its<br/>main bad guy. He, she, or it, is more powerful on this plane and all<br/>demons native to it obey that demon without question. Most Demon<br/>Lords stay on their own plane where they're nearly(and I mean that the<br/>universe almost has to be destroyed to take them out) immortal, but<br/>Xochial and the Dark Prince(nope, don't know his name, but it's<br/>probably something stupid like Escobar) are friends and drop by to<br/>exchange pleasantries every so often.<p>Hersh looked at me funny and asked,"You know my Lord?"<p>"Yeah, he practically raised me for a couple years. Taught me all<br/>kinds of neat stuff." I flicked my wrist and my athame appeared in my<br/>hand."He gave me this when I turned thirteen." The vorpal blade was<br/>almost as indestructable as Xochial himself, and when the proper<br/>magical energy existed, I could summon at will nearly any demon from<br/>his realm of my choosing.<p>Hersh's eyes widened as he took in the sight of my simple athame. In<br/>a single movement full of feline grace, he prostrated himself across<br/>Demon's arm and reverently asked,"Oh, he who is like a son to my Lord<br/>and Master, please allow Hersh to serve you?"<p>Wow. To say the least. I reached down and pulled the demon to his<br/>feet."None of that, man." It's nice to know that Xochial cares so much<br/>for me, a mere human."We're all friends here, right?"<p>Hersh nodded his head violently enough to make his semi-stiff cat ears<br/>flop around wildly."Yes, yes of course."<p>"Well then, since you see it my way, let's find your brothers and see<br/>if we can't get you home. I owe Xochial a lot and this may help to<br/>even things out a little."<p>****<p>Author's Notes: Nothing has really happened that was too important to<br/>Ranma and the gang in the last few chapters, but they go home next<br/>chapter, with an army of pokemon and cat demons at their back. Won't<br/>that be fun? I know that the war being planned by the inhabitants of<br/>Jusendo seems a bit hard to pull of, but consider, the world will be<br/>in chaos. No technology of any kind more advanced than pre-gun powder<br/>Europe in a world almost completely dependent on the modern<br/>conveniences. The Amazons, Musk(who for the purposes of this story<br/>number in the thousands and not three), and Phoenix Peoples just have<br/>to come through and slaughter the tattered ruins of civilization and<br/>maybe the occassional group of organized people that manages to pull<br/>itself together.<p>Send C&amp;C to dark_<p>
