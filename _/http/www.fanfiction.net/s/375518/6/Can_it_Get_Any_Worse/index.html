</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 5<p>With no small amount of awe, the senshi and I, along with a pair of<br/>talking cats watched Usagi's eyes flutter open and I could easily see<br/>a glaze fade from her eyes that I had never even noticed was there.<br/>Must've been something important locked away in there.<p>"Are you well, Usagi?" Luna asked worriedly. If she had been human<br/>she would have been biting her nails.<p>"Yeah, sure. Why is everyone looking at me like that? Do I have<br/>something on my face?" No one responded. A plane of air in front of<br/>Usagi solidified and became reflective. She examined herself in the<br/>makeshift mirror and shrugged when she found nothing wrong. I<br/>absolutely know that I hadn't taught her how to do that. Sure Ami<br/>knew how, but hers are always slightly blue tinted. This one was<br/>completely colorless.<p>If her overall intelligence improves along with her magical<br/>capability, there may yet be hope for the world."Hey Usagi, what's<br/>three plus three?" I asked.<p>"Six," she responded without thinking. I couldn't help myself. I<br/>looked into the coudless blue sky and mouthed the words,'Thank you'.<br/>I got over the shock faster than anyone else and spent an hour<br/>quizzing Usagi. The girl had a lot of magical knowledge pertaining to<br/>white sorcery in her head. That's all the mystical info she had. The<br/>three nonaligned spells I had managed to cram into her divinely<br/>thickened skull were forgotten. I patterned her a pure white spell<br/>that yours truly created, one designed to keep boogey men(they really<br/>exist) from congregating under your bed. She literally sucked the<br/>pattern out of the air!<p>All other attempts at getting the same results with varying classes<br/>and levels of magic were complete failures. She wouldn't be much good<br/>in a fight against anything non-hellspawned, but watch out if you are!<br/>This development had several other advantages. Usagi was no longer<br/>terminally braindead, or so I gathered from our short chat. The<br/>Silver Imperium Crystal was about as useful to her now as a chunk of<br/>concrete. And I didn't have to teach her anymore! I didn't count the<br/>few hours it would take to teach her all the white aligned spells I<br/>knew that she didn't.<p>The senshi decided to take their leader out to celebrate. I didn't<br/>want to be within range of that much concentrated girlishness. No<br/>more wasting time and energy on finding a new home and now I could<br/>really accelerate the lessons for the others. Two or three years and<br/>I'd be gone.<p>I opened my door and nearly tripped over an envelope that had been<br/>slipped under the door. I didn't immediately open it. Once the pit<br/>that is my stomach had been adequately satisfied and I'd reverted to a<br/>guy, I got around to it. Turns out Setsuna's webbed fingers don't<br/>stop her from writing afterall.<p>Dear Bastard,<p>I may not be able to do anything to you now, but when the conditions<br/>of the pact are met, you are mine!<p>,Your executioner<br/>Setsuna Meiou<p>The words were barely legible and there were traces of slime on the<br/>note. I didn't fail to get the message. She couldn't mess with my<br/>past or the pact would never have happened and we wouldn't have met<br/>and I wouldn't have made her life hell. She couldn't sic the senshi<br/>on me because they already liked me more than her and I did have the<br/>ring. I'm pretty confident that I can fight off a temporal assault.<br/>I'm not stupid enough to have absolute confidence against a Temporal<br/>mage safely hidden away at the Gates of Time, a place where I won't be<br/>able to reach when the pact is fulfilled.<p>Only option with one hundred percent survival rate? Separate myself<br/>from her sphere of influence. In other words, move to another<br/>universe.<p>****<p>A lot more time went by than I would have thought before the<br/>government called up begging me and my 'proteges' to pull their asses<br/>out of the fire. Fools should have known better than to perform a<br/>seaince(you know, hold hands in the dark and chant to call up spirits<br/>and other bad stuff) on a secret warlock burial ground. What were<br/>they trying to do, see what they guy wiped his ass with? Any spirit<br/>that has been emtombed for as long as this one had isn't going to be<br/>good for much more than that.<p>"I'm game," I said to the senshi."It's a paying job and really<br/>shouldn't be too hard. All we have to do is rescue a group of<br/>scientists. None of you even have to do any work, just come along to<br/>make sure nobody interferes with me when I'm busy." Bad things can<br/>happen when people do that. I think that's what sunk Atlantis.<p>The man in charge was kind enough to have a helicopter ride out to the<br/>site arranged for us. It was one of those expensive deals that is<br/>quieter than a hummingbird. I was hopping around in my seat like a<br/>nervous child by the time we arrived at the closest possible landing<br/>site. This was the kind of find that people like me, wizards,<br/>sorcerers, warlocks, etc, all dreamed about. The practice of<br/>separating oneself from reality at the moment of death had been<br/>stopped millenia ago, once it was discovered by some halfway<br/>intelligent wizard that the spirit left behind within its own tiny<br/>little bubbleverse suffers immense pain for eternity, kinda like hell,<br/>only worse. If you could find an ancient tomb like this, and had the<br/>proper training, which I did, you could use the energy to forge a<br/>magical tool of immense power. Ever heard of excalibur?<p>The raw power of Usagi's crystal, which I now have reason to believe<br/>may be one of those magical tools created at a very powerful tomb, is<br/>nothing compared to the 'pure' energy that can be found contained<br/>within the bubble that contains the spirit. I don't know why it works<br/>that way. No one does. I once read a theory that only went so far as<br/>to guess that since there were no other forces within the<br/>microverses(better term in my opinion) besides the relatively weak<br/>energy of a single spirit, that magic is distilled into its most basic<br/>form.<p>Whatever the reason, I was getting me something special today. I<br/>really couldn't decide what I wanted to make it into. Now that I<br/>think about it, what I would be getting my hands on today would be a<br/>tiny piece of creation itself. I would get to actually Make<br/>something. Whatever I wanted(within reasonable limits). Poor<br/>Setsuna, she was going to be one miserable bitch come tomorrow.<p>"You certainly are excited, Ranma," Ami commented moments before the<br/>aircraft began landing.<p>"This is sorta like my birthday times a million," I confessed. None<br/>of them would understand what was happening, not even Usagi and her<br/>little cranial library. White magic doesn't work well when<br/>interfering with reality. Makes me wonder why someone created the<br/>crystal just to hand it over to the All Mighty's bastard...nevermind,<br/>answered my own question.<p>Ami only gave me a puzzled look. The other senshi were too busy<br/>staring at the column of rainbow light rising from the top of the<br/>little mountain we would soon be flying to, under our own power.<p>****<p>"Don't let anything within twenty feet of me," I ordered."Not a cute<br/>little butterfly or a flying saucer. If the Emperer himself shows up<br/>and wants to kiss my feet, vaporize him." I pointed to the five<br/>scientists trapped within the column of light being given off by the<br/>breached tomb. They didn't look happy. In fact from the screaming<br/>and incoherent begging, I got the impression that they would have<br/>peeled their own skin off If it would have helped them escape."I don't<br/>want to end up like that, and I hope none of you do."<p>"What if it's a cute little kitten?" Usagi asked. She may not be an<br/>idiot, or an inept sorcerres any longer, but she was still an<br/>airheaded teenage girl.<p>"If it's your own mother," I insisted. She glared at me. I smiled<br/>pleasantly and she turned to look at the screaming people. She<br/>nodded.<p>Finally prepared, I made a small cut on the inside of my left forearm<br/>and thoroughly coated the blade of my athame in my own blood. The air<br/>crackled with energy and the ground trembled as I began to chant in a<br/>language so dead and ancient that I didn't even know what continent it<br/>originated on. As the ritual continued, the world fell away from my<br/>perceptions. Soon all I could sense were tiny flares of energy far<br/>behind me that signified the senshi standing guard. Within moments<br/>even that small bit of sensory input faded away. My mind, with the<br/>full backing of every shred of power I could muster, was now being<br/>propelled through that place between existances where an instant can<br/>last an eternity and infinity can go by in the blink of an eye. For<br/>obvious reasons, I have no idea how long I travelled this way.<p>When I found my target my powers were nearing their limit. That<br/>didn't matter, the hard part was over. Mentally, because I had no<br/>form here, I reached out to the pathetic little ovoid of milky colored<br/>wavering light. The shock of contact was almost orgasmic in its<br/>intensity. Carefully, so as not to lose too much energy, I opened a<br/>gateway in that microverse smaller than an electron. Despite the<br/>surrounding environment, I'm sure that no time passed between that<br/>action and a streak of blue light created by the escape of the soul<br/>trapped within being jettisoned back towards the relatively more<br/>pleasant realm of hell.<p>With the soul gone, the microverse collapsed in on itself, becoming<br/>nothing more than a mote of intense light. Within my mind I pictured<br/>the form I wished that energy to take. I decided earlier to follow<br/>the example of the creator of the Silver Imperium Crystal. Properly<br/>aligned, I could use such a crystal, one of my own making, to imitate<br/>almost anything that I could create now. And I wouldn't be limited to<br/>a simple energy source. No, my crystal would act as a lens for my own<br/>energy. No danger of burning myself out that way. Combine it with<br/>the Silver Imperium Crystal...well I'm not really greedy, I don't want<br/>to challenge the All Mighty.<p>The milky, multi-faceted crystal took shape in my mind and formed<br/>simultaneously in reality. Exhausted, I let consciousness fall away,<br/>avoiding a potentially painful reentry into my body.<p>****<p>I couldn't have been out long. The sun hadn't moved perceptibly at<br/>all. I stood shakily, hastily absorbing my crystal into my hand. I<br/>was too tired to try using it at the moment. The flattened<br/>mountaintop had been exposed to an awesome amount of heat, enough to<br/>leave it bubbling in most places and a thick layer of volcanic glass<br/>in the areas that had cooled. The senshi were all safely ensconced<br/>within shields of varying colors. I winced as I took in the sight of<br/>five badly charred individuals standing where the scientists had been<br/>transfixed. They weren't suffering any longer. Heh.<p>"Oops," I said.<p>"'Oops' is all you can say?" Rei shouted at me. I did deserve a<br/>little verbal abuse."Why don't you come over here and have a look at<br/>what you've done?"<p>Not in the mood to argue, I slowly gathered up some of the energy<br/>floating around, there was lots to go around, and tested out my new<br/>lens. Even with my diminished energy levels and physical exhaustion,<br/>I was able to cool the molten rock with hardly any effort. I<br/>staggered over to Rei, who had lowered her shield once the danger from<br/>the lava was gone. She silently pointed to the bottom of the<br/>mountain, then swept her arm from side to side.<p>"Oops," I repeated. What else can you say when you've just<br/>accidentally transported a mountain, yourself, and a gang of<br/>sorceress' in training to another universe? They didn't know we<br/>weren't in our own dimension. The senshi weren't that sensitive.<br/>They probably just thought we were somewhere in China or something. I<br/>hadn't even noticed the subtle differences in the ambient energy at<br/>first. All that late night exploring had paid off, sorta.<p>With the lens' help, I began restoring my reserves of energy at a nice<br/>break neck pace that would have turned me into a cinder unaided. How<br/>was I going to break the news? Better yet, how were they going to<br/>react when they found out that I wasn't sure if I could get us home?<p>Transdimensional plane hopping isn't to be taken lightly. Home<br/>coordinates and destination coordinates have to be firmly established.<br/>I hadn't done either. I was about to spill my guts when an idea<br/>struck me. Why did this have to be my fault at all? I could blame it<br/>on one of the senshi, Usagi would work best, and be just another<br/>unfortunate victim. Hell, for all I knew, this really wasn't my fault<br/>at all.<p>"Wait a minute," I said suspiscously,"who didn't follow instructions?<br/>Which one of you let something get too close?" I demanded. No one<br/>came forward, not that I had expected anyone to. I let them get<br/>indignant and angry at one another, with Rei looking ready to bitch<br/>slap Usagi, before deciding to play peace maker.<p>"I'm sorry I blamed you guys," I said understandingly."There was a lot<br/>of area for just five of you to cover." I felt a little bad about<br/>manipulating them, but it saved me a lot of trouble and didn't strain<br/>their friendships.<p>They accepted that explanation readily enough."Where do you think we<br/>are, Ranma?" Minako asked.<p>I shouldn't keep the truth from them. Here it comes."We're not really<br/>on Earth anymore. Actually, we're not in our home universe any<br/>longer."<p>Ami was the first to understand the implications of that statement.<br/>In a frightened whisper, she asked,"Ranma, do you know how to get us<br/>home?"<p>Ah, geeze. They all began giving me the frightened puppy dog look,<br/>complete with big giant, moistly shining eyes."I know 'how' to get us<br/>home," I answered honestly."I just don't know where home is."<p>****<p>We were all sitting around a good sized fire that I had made when the<br/>temperature started to drop as evening approached. Usagi was crying<br/>on Rei's shoulder.<p>"I can find our home dimension, eventually. It'll take a shit load of<br/>searching, but I can do it. Problem is that I don't have the<br/>necessary tools to do that. We're gonna have to hope this world is at<br/>least partially civilized, because I know how to magically polish and<br/>silver a mirror, but I don't have any idea how to get the quality of<br/>glass needed for the proper spells. That's only one essential item.<br/>I can probably improvise most of the others, it'll just take longer."<br/>To tell you the truth, I didn't much mind being on this world,<br/>wherever it was. The naturally occuring free energy that powered most<br/>magic was of a higher level and quantity here. The air was actually<br/>fresh, too.<p>"And I called Shingo a goat faced punk this morning," Usagi told Rei's<br/>shoulder. We ignored the blubbering girl.<p>"If we can find food and water, this shouldn't be too bad an<br/>experience," Makoto said with false cheer."I haven't been camping in<br/>years."<p>"That's the spirit. Tomorrow I'll find us something to eat and I'll<br/>work out a spell to lead us to the nearest people." If there were any<br/>people."Well, I'm beat, g'night." For lack of anything better to sleep<br/>on, I conjured up a cushion of air and made myself comfortable.<p>****<p>Three days later, after fighting off swarms of mosquitos and living<br/>off berries and a variety of wombat that I had convinced the girls was<br/>giant rabbit, we found a dirt road. It was the first sign of<br/>civilization and cheered the senshi and me up significantly. My<br/>tracking spell was generally effective. I think that the population<br/>was just too spread out for it to work as well as I'd hoped.<p>"Time to take a vote," I announced. Little things like that keep<br/>people happy."Which way do we go?" I was pretty sure they would say<br/>east. West led towards some unpleasant looking mountains. Unanimous<br/>decision. East.<p>Some time later, I asked,"Why don't we just fly?" I was embarassed<br/>that I hadn't thought of it earlier.<p>The girls all blushed. Yep, they were asking themselves the same<br/>question.<p>"One of us should have thought of this earlier, like three and a half<br/>days ago," Makoto said, raising her voice so she could be heard over<br/>the wind.<p>It's hard to say for certain, but I'd estimate we were travelling at<br/>about a hundred kilometers an hour. Plain dumb luck should lead us to<br/>something besides more road. Roads much longer than what we'd already<br/>travelled weren't very practical unless they had towns or some kind of<br/>hotel or supply depot along the way. That would be even more<br/>important in a preindustrial society. I'm starting to sound like Ami.<br/>Not the worst of the choices.<p>I didn't comment on that topic, instead asking,"Have any of you<br/>noticed the higher energy index of this planet?" I hadn't mentioned<br/>this earlier and was wondering if any one of the girls was naturally<br/>sensitive enough to pick up on the fact without it being pointed out<br/>to them.<p>Suprisingly, they all said they had felt something unusual. Minako,<br/>Makoto, and Rei had only felt a slight charge in the air. Usagi and<br/>Ami were seeing things as brighter than normal even though the light<br/>level was so close to our natural sun as to be indistinguishable and<br/>thought they saw and felt odd little crackles of energy when they<br/>worked magic. Now that Usagi was a mostly normal girl, I had a much<br/>weaker urge to murder her. She was turning out to be a dependable<br/>teammate too.<p>Argh, this camaraderie crap is contagious!<p>****<p>Our little dirt road joined with a much larger one made of<br/>painstakingly carved granite blocks interlocked with one another like<br/>pieces of a puzzle. The different shades and colors of the stone made<br/>the road more than an impressive piece of civil engineering. It was<br/>actually a work of art.<p>"I wish I had my camera," Minako lamented after a suitable amount of<br/>time gawking. Geeze, it was a road, not a naked woman.<p>"Just get a clear picture of it in your head and whenever we get home<br/>you can imprint it on photographic paper," I assured her."I taught you<br/>that spell the week before last.<p>"Oh yeah, I kinda forgot about it. Thanks for reminding me."<p>"This really is an astounding structure," Ami said, while viewing a 3-<br/>D image generated by her computer."I've been able to distinguish over<br/>seven hundred varieties of granite here. That shouldn't be possible."<p>"This isn't Earth," I reminded."This isn't even our universe. For all<br/>it's similarities to Earth, there could be just as many differences.<br/>This is just a minor one." If something like this was gonna happen, I<br/>wish it could have a waited a few years or at least until the girls<br/>really understood what was happening.<p>The Road ran perpendicular to our dirt one, heading off as far as the<br/>eye could see to the north and south. A few miles further east,<br/>through a stand of some kind of blue leaved trees, there was an ocean.<br/>It could have been a really big lake too, if lakes ever got that<br/>choppy. I hadn't been to the beach in years."Before we head out<br/>again, do any of you want to go for a swim?"<p>Minako was the only one reluctant and that was because she didn't have<br/>a swimsuit.<p>"Don't be silly," Makoto said teasingly."It's just us girls here." We<br/>all nodded encouragingly at her. Inside my head there was a giant<br/>evil grin.<p>"I guess," she seemed more embarassed at her reluctance itself than<br/>the prospect of being nude in front of her friends.<p>I checked to make sure the water wasn't posionous or infested with<br/>microscopic piranha or any other unpleasnat suprise before letting the<br/>other girls into the water. The water was only slightly salty. I<br/>turned back toward the other to make sure they made it into the water.<br/>Hint, wink, nudge, grin. All of the senshi are really much more<br/>mature physically than your standard everyday sixteen year old girl.<br/>And they're hot. No two ways to say it. And they all had pierced<br/>nipples. What in hell?<p>"What in hell?" I shouted, forgetting to ride out the next wave and<br/>nearly choking on a mouth full of seawater. I was quickly rescued,<br/>needlessly, by three of the senshi. I let Rei give me mouth to mouth<br/>for a few seconds before pretending to start breathing again.<p>"Are you hurt? What happened? Why did you go so far if you can't<br/>swim?" I endured their barrage of worried questions, slightly touched<br/>that they cared. Don't make a big deal out of it.<p>I told them that I had stepped into a hole and lost my footing. They<br/>believed me. Then I pretended to just happen to notice the<br/>piercings."Um, why are your nipples pierced? Not that they don't look<br/>great and all, you girls just don't seem like the type."<p>They all looked at Makoto. She blushed, finally answering,"We were<br/>having a sleep over at my apartment and I fixed a bunch of snacks and<br/>punch and stuff like that. I spiked the punch a little..."<p>"But none of us knew that and we all spiked it a little too," Rei said<br/>guiltily.<p>"We still can't figure out who's idea it was," Ami said,<br/>absentmindedly toying with the small gold ring in her right<br/>breast."All I can remember is waking up and they were already there."<p>"I remember most of it," Usagi added.<p>"And since we already had had it done, we decided to keep them,"<br/>Minako finished.<p>Well. Well, well, well. Maybe my little students weren't so innocent<br/>afterall."That's cool. When we get back home, I might see about<br/>having it done too." Not that that statement was in any way honest. I<br/>use too much direct energy to ever have any kind of metal in such<br/>close contact with my body. In fact, Makoto probably would have<br/>electrocuted herself by now if she wasn't so closely bound to her<br/>element.<p>My last comment broke down into a debate on whether gold or silver was<br/>better, then if hoops or bars were more attractive. I was really<br/>enjoying myself. They just kept playing with their tits! A storm<br/>coming in off the ocean interrupted the little party. A bitterly cold<br/>wind preceded the black clouds. With no shelter in sight and having<br/>no desire to be stranded in such bad weather, I said,"Get your stuff<br/>together and I'll make us a little magic tent." Previously, before the<br/>ritual that had secured my crystal(I still haven't been able to think<br/>of a good name for it) it would have been an exhausting experience<br/>maintaining any kind of spell within a storm as fierce as this one<br/>promised to be. Now I could use the excess energy that I would have<br/>had to fight to keep the spell cohesive to actually hold it in place.<p>The dome was pretty spacious, with a sand bottom that was partially<br/>wet. I covered most of it in an invisible cushion of air, but at<br/>Usagi's request, I left enough of it exposed for her to build sand<br/>castles.<p>"So these last few nights when we were all being chewed up by swarms<br/>of mosquitos, you could have just made this?" Rei asked, deceptively<br/>calm.<p>"Uh huh," I answered, lounging comfortably on the air cushion.<p>"Why didn't you?" Still much calmer than she felt.<p>"No one ever asked and I've already taught you the spell that keeps<br/>insects away. Ami used it. I guess you forgot. Sorry." I sounded<br/>sleepily disinterested. Rei lunged at me, more playfully than the<br/>last dozen or so times. I lazily raised my hand and allowed a tiny,<br/>almost imperceptible arc of electricity to fly from it and directly to<br/>Rei's right nipple ring. She yelped like a kicked dog and screeched<br/>in pain. "Play nice," I warned the glaring girl. Waving a finger that<br/>trailed sparks into the air. I hadn't really hurt her, I knew. She<br/>could have brushed her hair and gotten more of a charge than what I<br/>just used.<p>Rei had a maniacal gleam in her eyes that amost made me raise my<br/>shields. I noticed that she was lookin at Usagi instead of me and<br/>relaxed. Fire being the girl's element, it was difficult for her to<br/>create any kind of electrical energy, but when she managed to call it<br/>up, Rei's effort was a sizable charge about ten times stronger than<br/>what I used on her. I winced in sympathy for Usagi and covered my<br/>ears.<p>The scream was blood curdling and Usagi's spasming leg caused her to<br/>destroy what she had claimed to be a copy of the palace she had once<br/>lived in during her previous life. It had looked pretty good. A few<br/>minutes later I was forced to restrain the two girls who were really<br/>going at it.<p>"It was just a joke!" Rei swore vehemently."I didn't mean for it to be<br/>that strong, Usagi. I promise!" The big hand print on the side of her<br/>face would definitely leave a mark.<p>Usagi glared at her friend, all the while rubbing at her pained<br/>nipple. What had I started? I sighed and let fly with another charge<br/>of electricity, equal to what Rei had used on Usagi. Rei flopped<br/>around like a fish out of water. When she stopped screaming, both her<br/>and Usagi were glaring at me."Hey, don't look at me like that. I did<br/>it to Rei because she was trying to gouge my eyes out again. Rei did<br/>it to you out of sheer bitchiness. I did it to Rei again so that she<br/>would have the common sense not to try it again."<p>The other senshi had watched in a mix of fascination, awe, and horror.<br/>I couldn't blame them for protectively covering their chests with<br/>their arms. Those things are a lot more sensitive than a guy's. For<br/>obvious reasons, I know all to well.<p>"I'm sorry that I started this crap. There. Now I'm going to go to<br/>sleep and we're going to forget that this ever happened." I made<br/>myself comfortable and closed my eyes. Things would be back to normal<br/>tomorrow, if a little strained between Usagi and Rei<p>****<p>Author's Notes: Another one.
