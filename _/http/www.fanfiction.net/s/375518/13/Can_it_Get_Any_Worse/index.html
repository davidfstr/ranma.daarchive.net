</div><p>"Ranma, hurry," Makoto called to me. Telerin and I were discussing<br/>some of the eccentricities of the strange religion that had sprung up<br/>around the spell constructs and how the citizens of Chicago lived.<br/>Thousands upon thousands of years must have passed since the Chicago I<br/>knew existed. The culture here had absolutely no memory of its<br/>origin.<p>There was a knot of girls gathered around south facing window.<br/>Telerin and I walked over, still talking."Chicago is constantly on the<br/>move," the Caretaker explained."When resources begin to grow scarce,<br/>teams of men are gathered to make excursions to the surface."<p>I had figured something like that."What about food? There must be a<br/>lot of people to feed in a city this size." There were small gardens<br/>behind most houses, but they couldn't possibly support the multitudes.<p>"Perhaps I should rephrase my last response. The teams of men are<br/>trained foragers that work in groups of several thousand, at the very<br/>least. Littered across the world are tracts of land completely barren<br/>of life, despite our passage having been centuries ago." Okay, that<br/>was a pretty good answer.<p>"And what happens when the city is over open water?" That comment<br/>about the land being barren after Chicago's passing was unusual, but I<br/>decided to drop it for now.<p>Telerin shrugged."Chicago is adequately supplied with fishing vessels.<br/>Fish, and especially whales, have many useful bodily components." I<br/>hadn't seen any harbors, and boats didn't just park themselves in a<br/>gargae somewhere. That was another unimportant issue.<p>We were right behind the girls now. They made a path for me, either<br/>unconsciously or intentionally blocking Telerin's further<br/>approach."Wow, nice mob." Mob didn't really describe the mass of<br/>screaming maniacs that was slowy crawling towards this building. I<br/>squinted and sharpened my vision as best I could with chi."It's<br/>Stinky!" Sure enough, the first Caretaker we had met was leading the<br/>ravening army of idiots towards us, waving his unbroken arm wildly<br/>above his head.<p>"He works fast," commented Telerin, finally managing to squeeze his<br/>way through the girls' defense."What did you do to the Tyrant?"<p>Tyrant didn't sound much like an insult when Telerin said it. It<br/>sounded like a title."I broke his arm in seven different places."<br/>Telerin looked at me in horror."What?"<p>"He-he's t-the Tyrant. The Tyrant is the spiritual leader of the<br/>entire city of Chicago!" I don't think Telerin was too happy to be my<br/>associate anymore. In fact, I think Telerin was seriously thinking<br/>about jumping out of the unglazed window and ending what he felt would<br/>be a significant amount of future pain.<p>I laughed at the distraught man. I couldn't help it."What kind of<br/>idiots are you people, to let a monster like that come to power?" The<br/>sneer on my face was a nice addition to the derisive tone I took. The<br/>odor alone should have kept the pervert out of office.<p>Telerin seemd unfazed by my attitude. He looked mournfully down at<br/>the approaching horde."My life hasn't really been very enjoyable,<br/>anyway. Maybe I'll be reincarnated as a bird or something."<p>Ah geeze, he was about to start crying."Cheer up," I said."Stinkey and<br/>his crowd aren't going to bother us, I assure you." This is where<br/>having legions of pokemon comes in handy. The deeply ingrained fear<br/>of all non-human(with the exception of horses and a few chickens I saw<br/>earlier) life the people of Chicago seem to have, doesn't hurt one<br/>bit.<p>So much for cooperation from the population."Time to turn loose the<br/>pokemon," I informed the senshi. They were each carrying their six<br/>strongest, most fearsome beasts, with the exception of Rei, who's<br/>super rat was the only occupent on her ball-belt. Usagi had thrown a<br/>bitch fit about leaving all her others behind, but we'd convinced her<br/>to leave them under guard with a couple of Dragonites.<p>Chances were that no one would bother our pets, then again, those<br/>tapestries had depicted men doing battle with demons. That must have<br/>been a long time ago.<p>"I don't understand what-" That was as far as Telerin got, seeing as<br/>how twenty eight pokemon were materializing a few hundred feet in<br/>front of the mob. He screamed, like I'd expected, and tried to bolt<br/>for the stairs. I reached out and grabbed him by the hood of his<br/>robe, jerking him back to the window. He screamed again when I made<br/>him look at the pokemon who were doing their best to look mean.<p>"Calm down, man, calm down!" I shouted in his ear."They're not<br/>demons!" He probably thought I sounded like a lunatic, trying to<br/>convince him that Demon and the other pokemon weren't actually demons.<p>Telerin screamed. I slapped him. He didn't stop screaming. I<br/>finally just gave up and decked the wuss."I guess we should try out<br/>the cute, cuddly ones next, eh?" I asked as we watched the mob come to<br/>a screeching halt. It didn't really slow down all that fast, mobs<br/>don't do that, but they took a lot less time than I had imagined.<br/>Demon threw his head back and cut loose with an absolutely huge column<br/>of flame. I was really proud of him. The other pokemon followed his<br/>lead and within seconds there were all kinds of deadly energy attacks<br/>blazing through the sky.<p>Poor mob, I almost felt sorry for it. All those people that got<br/>trampled as it turned around and ran for its collective life probably<br/>weren't feeling too well either.<p>****<p>"Setsuna, how could you trust someone who so blatantly associated with<br/>demons?" Haruka shouted, shocked at Sailor Pluto's(the single person<br/>whom was never ever supposed to be wrong) blunder and the toll it had<br/>taken on the ranks of the senshi.<p>"Don't question me, girl," commanded Setsuna rigidly. She couldn't<br/>blame Haruka for being mad about being taken out of her car in the<br/>middle of a race, it had then hit the wall and exploded, but she<br/>wouldn't allow the lesser being to question her."I am not totally<br/>infalable. Whoever manipulated me into contacting Ranma must be<br/>unimaginably powerful. I fear that even if the Inner Senshi were<br/>here, this new threat could simply ignore us."<p>"What about Crystal Tokyo? Can't we get some help from the future<br/>senshi? The way I understand it, the Inners bailed them out of a<br/>pretty bad situation before Haruka and I awakened." Michiru reached<br/>out to stroke Hotaru's hair. The little girl had taken a turn for the<br/>better after the phenomonal growth spurt last year that had returned<br/>her to preadolescense, but now her health was worsening almost by the<br/>day. Setsuna believed Ranma or his master to be the blame for this,<br/>too.<p>Setsuna shook her head in frustration."As of right now, the Inner<br/>Senshi have no future. Therefore, there is no Crystal Tokyo."<p>"Is there anything we can do?" Haruka asked, her hands gripping the<br/>arms of her chair tightly enough to make the wood creak.<p>"We have one chance and one chance only," Setsuna answered. The<br/>Outers leaned forward in anticipation of the solution."I can send you<br/>two back in time, without your powers, and hope that you'll be able to<br/>manipulate other magical warriors into destroying Ranma before his<br/>powers are fully realized"<p>"Why wouldn't we have our powers?" Haruka asked, sounding angry, but<br/>inwwardly frightened. She'd been an absolute bitch to almost<br/>everyone, and relied heavily on the security of being able to<br/>transform into Sailor Uranus. Afterall, who in their right mind<br/>messes with someone capable of calling up an earthquake with a snap of<br/>her wrist?<p>Setsuna sighed."Since you already exist in the past you will be<br/>travelling to, the link between your planets belong to your past<br/>selves. Unlike the Inner Senshi who are true sorceresses, you three<br/>get your power from a direct mana-bind with your respective planet."<p>Michiru asked,"Won't this course of action violate the blood pact<br/>between you and Ranma, Setsuna?"<p>"No, as long as I don't directly participate in harming or killing<br/>Ranma, the pact remains intact." Setsuna had made the mistake of<br/>underestimating Ranma and the amount of spite he carried within her<br/>heart. He would pay, oh he would definitely pay. With his miserable<br/>life.<p>"Hotaru can't come with us, then," Haruka said firmly. They all knew<br/>that the little girl's power as Sailor Saturn was the only factor<br/>keeping her alive.<p>"Of course not," confirmed Setsuna.<p>****<p>"Oh, Ryoga, ohhhh!" Kasumi moaned into her pillow as Ryoga thrust<br/>into her for the last time, spilling his seed deep into her womb.<br/>Still trembling as tiny orgasms rocked through her, Kasumi drew Ryoga<br/>into a pssionate kiss.<p>The eldest Tendo was just drawing back for a breathe of air when her<br/>door banged open. Ryoga sqeaked in fright and attempted to hide under<br/>the covers.<p>"There you are," Nabiki snapped. She was dressed in a leather neglige<br/>and had a coiled bull whip hanging at her hip."It's my night with him,<br/>Kasumi."<p>Kasumi looked down at Ryoga, his cock still held tightly within<br/>her."But, Nabiki," Kasumi whined,"I thought you had a date tonight.<br/>Can't we make work something out?"<p>Nabiki shook her head."I'm horny." She walked over to the bed and<br/>grabbed Ryoga by the ear."Come on, lover boy."<p>Ryoga finally spoke."Um, can-can I have a break, please?" His face was<br/>flushed and his left eye kept twitching. Between them, the Tendo<br/>sisters hadn't let him get a night of sleep in almost a week.<p>Nabiki shook her head. She reached down and carressed Ryoga's dick,<br/>still hard and ready to please."No, I'm afraid not. Akane's waiting<br/>for you in my room and she's a little desperate for relief. You<br/>should do just the trick. Then it'll be my turn for a few hours."<br/>Ryoga looked like he would cry."Don't worry, Kasumi, I'll bring him<br/>back in the morning," she assured her older sister.<p>****<p>Downstairs, Soun Tendo cowered in his closet, weeping uncontrollably.<br/>He clutched his head in a desperate attempt to keep out the horrible<br/>sounds coming from upstairs. It did him no good.<p>****<p>Telerin came awake with a start and hurriedly surveyed the room. When<br/>he found no demons-or pokemon, he calmed dramatically. I couldn't<br/>spoil the moment, so I said,"No, it wasn't a dream."<p>The man didn't even scream."What are they? The old tales claim that<br/>demons have no masters, yet you and your women clearly control those<br/>creatures."<p>I ignored the growls of promised pain to come from the girls. Telerin<br/>was just not at his best today."Demons do, in fact, have masters. But<br/>that's beside the point. Those creatures you saw are called pokemon.<br/>They're animals on the last world we visited. Most of them are too<br/>cute to believe, but we picked our meaner looking ones for today, just<br/>encase crowd control became a problem."<p>"So they're not going to eat my soul and wear my skin as a trophy?" ha<br/>asked hopefully. Where had he been getting his information? Sure,<br/>demons ate souls, well most of them did, but none of them wore human<br/>skin. From a demon's point of view, wearing a human's skin would be<br/>about as bad as draping themselves in used tampons.<p>"No, Telerin, none of that. The big one with the wings that started<br/>out blowing fire into the air, he eats other pokemon sometimes, but<br/>that's nothing for you to worry about."<p>"That pokemon is a menace," Rei snapped. She had her super rat in her<br/>lap and was scratching it affectionately behind the ears. It had burn<br/>slave spread across it right side and most of its fur had been singed<br/>off, making it even uglier.<p>"Demon isn't the only fire pokemon, you know?" I think Rei was just<br/>jealous that her only pokemon was so small that it could fit between<br/>the teeth of Demon. Telerin started to look panicky again."Don't<br/>worry, Telerin, Demon is just the name of one of my pokemon. He's not<br/>really a demon." I wonder if Ami could whip up some homemade prozac,<br/>or maybe some perkeset(not sure on spelling), because we needed this<br/>guy sane and if he started freaking out every time we mentioned<br/>pokemon, we might as well toss him out the window and find another<br/>Caretaker.<p>"Well if that monstrosity hadn't decided to show off, Ratty wouldn't<br/>be burned, now would he?" I'll be glad when some of the girls' pokemon<br/>mate and start laying eggs. Rei really needs something to focus on<br/>besides that beaver-toothed rodent.<p>I waved the matter aside with a dismissive gesture I just knew would<br/>piss her off."Give it a potion and a few hours sleep and it'll be<br/>fine." Back to scaredypants."How about we head on down to those<br/>archives you mentioned earlier? I need to look through them and see<br/>if there is anything I'm forgetting to ask you."<p>"Anything to get out of this place before another mob shows up."<br/>Telerin stood, then his eyes got that nervous quality to them<br/>again."It doesn't really bother me, since I'm of the much smaller<br/>order of Caretakers that remain celebate, but your women aren't<br/>properly dressed to move through Chicago. We would be able to pass<br/>with much less attention being drawn if they were better conceiled."<br/>He didn't even know how close he was coming to getting mauled by a<br/>pack of angry senshi.<p>"We'd better clear something up real quick. These girls aren't my<br/>'women'. They're my friends and students for the most part, and<br/>royaly of a sort on our home world. Actually, if those Wings of God<br/>things weren't annuling their powers, each of them would most likely<br/>be able to destroy this city by themselves, so treat them with some<br/>respect." There was just enough implied threat in my voice to get the<br/>message through.<p>Telerin coughed, then looked at the group of senshi who stood glaring<br/>at him."I'm terribly sorry for my earlier behavior, ladies, and your<br/>clothing is nice, I assure you, but no woman in Chicago is allowed out<br/>in her undergarments. Unfortunately, what you are now wearing is<br/>quite a bit more revealing than the standard undergarment would be."<p>The senshi were nodding reluctantly. I thought they all looked pretty<br/>good, myself. They wore colors that matched their elemental<br/>affinities, an unconscious action I think. The shirts and tank tops<br/>were pretty tight and the shorts and skirts could have been longer,<br/>but back in Japan and PokeWorld, those clothes hadn't been anywhere<br/>near daring."What would you suggest they wear?" I asked.<p>Telerin looked around the room. There were lots of cloaks and robes<br/>laying around, some left behind in the evacuation and others hung on<br/>racks."If you ladies kept the hoods drawn and altered your stride<br/>adequately, we could all pass for men. 'That' would save us a lot of<br/>hassle when we get to the Archives."<p>I nodded and began collecting armloads of the garments. I wasn't the<br/>only one to do this and we soon had four giant piles of black, green<br/>and purple robes and cloaks. The senshi took way longer than I<br/>thought necessary to find stuff that fit them. When they finally did,<br/>though, we headed down the stairs with Telerin in the lead.<p>****<p>"Your mirror should allow you to find Ranma, Michiru," Setsuna told<br/>them."It's power is directly related to your soul, so it will still<br/>work, as will your sword, Haruka. Once you find the boy, do not harm<br/>him," the temporal mage stressed."Break this vial over his head and<br/>use a rag to smear it as thoroughly as possible over his body. If the<br/>contents touches you, whatever it touches will have to be cut off or<br/>every devil hunter in Japan will be after you." She handed Michiru a<br/>small glass vial with a clear fluid inside.<p>"We understand," the two senshi said almost simultaneously.<p>Setsuna didn't bother to transform to her senshi state, simply<br/>summoning the time key and opening a portal to seventeen years in the<br/>past. The Outer Senshi lept through the portal holding tightly to one<br/>another's hand.<p>The portal had just closed when Setsuna realized what a horrible<br/>mistake she had just made. She was the reason that Ranma was so well<br/>liked by demons! Without her interference, Ranma Saotome would have<br/>died during the cat-fist training. Setsuna fainted, all the while<br/>screaming at the injustice of it all.<p>And so the cycle continues.<p>(I think it's sorta funny to have Setsuna be the cause of her months<br/>of torment, don't you?)<p>****<p>Author's Notes: Short chapter, I know, but a good stopping point.<br/>C&amp;C welcome at dark_<p>
