</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 13<p>"Amazing!" Ami exclaimed."This Newspaper goes back to the year 2098."<br/>We had been rummaging through the lower floors of the Archives for<br/>about half the day, finding all kinds of useless crap. Most of the<br/>stuff was just books and magazines stored in the library that the<br/>Archives had become and it was all in English. Ami and I were the<br/>only ones who could read any of it. Telerin was stunned speechless<br/>by that alone, saying that the language had been dead in Chicago for<br/>millenia.<p>I hurried over to the girl, leaving behind Telerin and his crash<br/>course in pokemon accustommization. Usagi was really getting a kick<br/>out of showing the man all of the cute pokemon in her pokedex."What<br/>have you found?" I'd found records at least three hundred years more<br/>recent than Ami's paper and none of it had shed any light on the<br/>changes that occured to Chicago to make it into it's present day city-<br/>state.<p>Ami pointed to the headline of the yellowed piece of crumbling paper.<br/>Everything down here was remarkably preserved, at least. The headline<br/>read,'Self proclaimed Queen of Earth, Usagi Tsuniko, defeated at<br/>last!'."Ami, whatever you do, don't tell the others about this," I<br/>ordered. Ami would have known better than to do that, but I had said<br/>it by reflex.<p>"I wasn't planning on it, Ranma. It just suprised me, that's all."<br/>She laid the paper down and looked at me imploringly."Ranma, if some<br/>form of senshi existed in this universe and they were deposed like<br/>that, couldn't that happen to us when the times comes on our world?"<br/>She didn't seem like she could accept the possibility.<p>I shrugged."Anything is possible, I guess, just look at this place, an<br/>actual floating city, but I really doubt that will happen on our<br/>Earth. Usagi and the rest of you senshi, along with the army of<br/>pokemon that Usagi plans on breeding, will be more than powerful<br/>enough to take over the Earth when the time comes. And besides,<br/>you'll have me on your side." What better insurance could you ask for<br/>than that?<p>Ami smiled at me, patting the bench beside her. Obviously, I sat<br/>down, wrapping my arm around her waist in the process."I'm sure you're<br/>right, dear, but that isn't supposed to happen. Usagi is supposed to<br/>become ruler by complete consent of the people of Earth, not through a<br/>long, bloody battle."<p>The 'dear' comment about made me do my little disappearing routine<br/>again, Ami's arm around me and the warm emotions I felt coming from<br/>her stopped me. I'm doomed, I know now. Absolutely doomed."That's a<br/>long time away and in a completely different plane of existance. The<br/>people of Earth may accept Usagi with open arms. If they don't, well,<br/>maybe I can arrange for you to be in charge." DO NOT SAY A WORD!<p>The girl squeezed me around the waist and laid her head on my<br/>shoulder. Oh well, might as well live with it as best as I can.<p>"Ranma..." Ami murmurred into my shirt warningly.<p>"Just being pessimistic, ignore me." Communication isn't going to be a<br/>problem like I hear it is in a lot of other relationships.<p>****<p>"Now is the time, Master," Lady Kima said, bowing to Lord Saffron.<br/>Her white and purple-speckled wings were folded tightly against her<br/>back and a plain hilted sword hung at her hip.<p>"And the senshi?" Saffron asked, his voice rising and the light<br/>emitted by his body darkening to red in anger. He hadn't forgotten<br/>his ill treatment during the Silver Millenium by the Sailor Senshi and<br/>their Bitch Queen. If anything, the ancient resentment had festered<br/>and grown through each of Saffron's incarnations.<p>"Gone, my lord. We know not where. Only the temporal mage, Setsuna<br/>Meiou, remains and she appears to be thoroughly preoccupied with more<br/>pressing matters." Kima hadn't forgotten the old tales, stories told<br/>by mothers to frighten newly hatched Phoenix People. Her race had<br/>been visciously oppressed for a thousand years, and their lord and<br/>master had been enslaved by their Fire Witch. Now, with their power<br/>gone from the world, Lord Saffron's empire would know no bounds.<p>"Then, my loyal servant, send emissaries to the Musk and Amazon<br/>nations. Tell them of our plans and invite them to join the cause,"<br/>the Phoenix King ordered.<p>"As my lord commands," Kima stated before rising from her knee and<br/>marching to the open window. Once there, she unfurled her wings and<br/>stepped off of the railless balcony.<p>"The world shall be mine!"<p>****<p>Setsuna screamed a lot that day. Then came the overwhelming urge to<br/>blow something up. After that she seriously contemplated suicide. If<br/>only she had thought about her actions. If only she had considered<br/>the consequences of those actions. Now though, she had perpetuated a<br/>time loop and to attempt to change that loop after its initiation<br/>would be very, very bad. What could she do? Any action she took<br/>would cause a paradox that would change her memory along with everyone<br/>else's. Ranma would still be in the picture as the Inner Senshi's<br/>teacher and she would have no knowledge of his true intent.<p>Haruka and Michiru had arrived from their little trip minutes after<br/>their departure. The couple had a nice bronze tan and several bags of<br/>cloths. Retro seemed to be in style again. They'd found their less<br/>than illustrious leader ranting and raving like a madwoman. Before<br/>they could help her, though, she'd teleported herself back to the<br/>Gates of Time and continued her breakdown.<p>(Note that time does not pass in the Gates of Time as it does in the<br/>rest of the universe)<p>Several months later:<p>Setsuna sat on a badly soiled sofa, watching an episode of Welcome<br/>Back Cotter. In her left hand a two-liter coke bottle rested, ready<br/>to be poured at a moments notice, and her right hand sported the<br/>leading end of a three mile long fruit roll up fruit snack. Her<br/>Sailor Pluto uniform hadn't been changed since she'd planted herself<br/>on the couch and her growing bulk was threatening to burst it at its<br/>seems.<p>****<p>I'd quickly changed my planned approach to the whole Chicago<br/>problem. The people just wouldn't cooperate. And they were idiots.<br/>I don't mean ignorant, but with the ability to learn, these people<br/>were just idiots. Telerin appeared to be about the most intelligent<br/>person in the whole city and look how life had treated him.<p>Caretakers were expected to provide their own lodgings with the money<br/>they drew as a weekly stipend. Telerin's stipend barely allowed him<br/>to maintain a closet-sized room and leave him enough food to survive<br/>on. We certainly wouldn't be staying with him, and since we needed<br/>his help, he had to stay with us.<p>He didn't much like the idea, but he didn't really have a choice.<br/>Stinkey was out for our blood, Telerin's included. So, with each of<br/>us burdened with bundles of ancient documents and books that I hoped<br/>could shed some light on a way to transfer energy from the constructs,<br/>we snuck from the Archive building after night fell and the attendent<br/>guards went home. Why have guards in the day time if you're not going<br/>to have them at night? Idiotic people.<p>Telerin took a lot of convincing, but I finally managed to persuade<br/>him to climb into Demon's hand. I stepped up onto the other one and<br/>the giant pokemon gently closed his hands until we were each held<br/>snugly in his grip. Telerin managed not to scream during the whole<br/>flight, another point in his favor.<p>Usagi's Dragonites flew up from the dark sea of grass below to greet<br/>us. Telerin did scream then, but stopped himself before I had to get<br/>involved.<p>"So this is what true ground feels like," the Caretaker mused out loud<br/>after we'd set up camp for the night."From all the stories I hear from<br/>foragers, it's supposed to be like being stuck in a pit of tar. Not<br/>that I know what that feels like, but they described that too..." He<br/>walked off into the gloom, muttering to himself.<p>A couple hours later, when I had nearly convinced Ami to slip off into<br/>the grass with me, Minako said,"Guys, come look at this one." Why the<br/>girl hadn't volunteered her knowledge of English to me earlier I don't<br/>know, but Usagi's explanation of her friend's stay in England as a<br/>fighter for love and justice had got boring fast, so I couldn't be<br/>blamed for that.<p>I cursed and detached from Ami. Minako was reading by the fire. The<br/>sheet of plastic she read from was the standard replacement for paper<br/>after about 2100. The material was tough, resistant to heat, and gave<br/>one hell of a paper-plastic cut, whatever. I scanned through the<br/>document she handed up to me, reading the first few lines to<br/>myself.'Wide scale nuclear bombardment over majority of Africa and<br/>Asia. Experts expect fallout to cover much of the globe, concentrated<br/>mostly in southern Europe and the desert regions of Australia'.<p>No wonder magic started being more commonplace here. Planet sized<br/>disturbances like that can cause all kinds of nasty side effects.<br/>Just look at the invention of the television. Do you think that half<br/>the world used to sit on its collective ass before the little moving<br/>piture box was invented. The prevalence of magically gifted children<br/>coming into the world would lead to a more indepth study of magic, and<br/>a revival of much of the old knowledge.<p>The fact that the world was going straight down the toilet probably<br/>prompted a lot of people to start looking for into alternatives<br/>lifestyles, too.<p>"Sucks, don't it?" I asked, handing the plastic sheet back to<br/>Minako."I can't believe they actually nuked more than half the world's<br/>population over fishing rights. But if you look at it from a certain<br/>perspective, that could have been nature's way of saying that you're<br/>all too stupid to live. Seems to me like something should have<br/>happened to all the old people in charge of everything, though, and<br/>not the normal people. Oh well, not my problem."<p>"How could you say that?" Usagi almost shouted. Leave it to her to<br/>feel compassion for people who'd been dust for so many freakin years.<p>I shrugged."Don't whine, Usagi, it'll give you wrinkles." 'That' shut<br/>the future queen up faster than if I'd stapled her lips together.<p>Ami and I slipped back into the grass, leaving Minako with<br/>instructions to keep any more discoveries to herself until morning.<p>****<p>"Ranma, I think you may need to do something about Demon," Makoto said<br/>a couple days later. We were steadily moving through the material<br/>from the Archives, our fourth load, and Telerin was almost adjusted to<br/>being around pokemon."He's still growing and I noticed him looking at<br/>Fluffums," an ugly little Snubull,"like she was a snack. If this<br/>keeps up, Demon may actually eat one of our pokemon."<p>This had been coming for a while. Demon was maybe a third the size of<br/>Gojiro now and eating huge swathes of grass daily."I'll take him back<br/>to the forest and let him hunt himself stupid, how's that?" I asked.<p>"That's fine with me," Makoto answered, turning back to her breakfast<br/>of rabbit stew.<p>I told Ami about my little side trip and she insisted that she go<br/>along. I didn't really mind, but I went through the motions of<br/>refusal anyway."But this is supposed to be one of those male-bonding<br/>things, between Demon and me," I protested.<p>Ami looked at me, her eyes flat, but a tiny smile gracing her small<br/>mouth."Ranma, don't even waste your breath. Demon can carry me<br/>without any trouble and it wouldn't hurt him to become more aquainted<br/>with me. We are going to know each other for a while. Besides, I can<br/>be reached on my communicator if there is any trouble here at the<br/>camp."<p>I gave up, abandoning my last few arguments. Ami didn't need any<br/>verbal confirmation, reaching up and giving me a quick hug when she<br/>felt my capitulation.<p>****<p>Hunting hismself stupid turned out to take Demon longer than I had<br/>imagined. Ami and I mostly had the days to ourselves and used them<br/>for lots and lots of cardiovascular exercise. I was starting to get a<br/>little sore, when after two and a half weeks, Ami's communicator<br/>started buzzing.<p>Ami held the watch-like device at an angle so whoever was on the other<br/>end couldn't see her unclad body and asked,"What's wrong?"<p>I peaked over her shoulder and saw Minako in the little screen."I just<br/>thought you and Ranma would want to know that the stuff we picked up<br/>last night has begun to use some Japanese. I think we're getting<br/>pretty close to the actual cause for Chicago to go airborn."<p>I sighed. The vacation and countless hours of wild sex were at an<br/>end, at least temporarily."We'll be there as soon as I can round Demon<br/>up."<p>Minako nodded, blushing as Ami turned the screen at an angle that<br/>showed way too much of me to be decent. The screen went blank.<p>"That wasn't very nice," I chided."I feel so violated. And think<br/>about poor Minako, she'll never be able to find anyone even close to<br/>my standards." I didn't really mind, but this had 'I've been naughty,<br/>please spank me' written all over it.<p>****<p>"I just discovered the most amazing thing," Kasumi said excitedly to<br/>her sisters."If you turn Ryoga into a pig them change him back, 'Little<br/>Ryoga' is fully recovered and ready for more." She held a weakly<br/>struggling P-chan under one arm.<p>Soun banged his head on the coffe table really hard, rendering himself<br/>unconscious.<p>Nabiki waved Kasumi's discovery off."Old news, big sister. I've known<br/>that for weeks," she confessed.<p>Kasumi looked at her middle sister in a heartbroken sort of way and<br/>her lower lip began to tremble. With pearly tears in her eyes, she<br/>asked,"A-all this time, a-and you didn't tell me?" She turned her gaze<br/>to Akane who was in the process of slipping a home movie of her and<br/>Ryoga into the VCR."Not you too, Akane."<p>"Sorry, big sister. I just didn't think about telling you." Akane<br/>actually hadn't felt much like sharing.<p>Kasumi sniffed."Well fine, I'm going to go lock myself in my room with<br/>Ryoga and I'm not coming down to cook for anyone for a week. See how<br/>you like that!" The eldest Tendo, P-chan now squirming desperately<br/>under her arm, stomped upstairs and slammed her door.<p>"Geeze, who unplugged her vibrator?" Nabiki asked caustically.<p>Akane shrugged and made herself comfortable just as the screen began<br/>to display her movie. The Tendos, with the exception of Soun, had<br/>never been happier and they didn't plan on ever letting Ryoga escape<br/>their grasp. Who knew how many days he would be gone if that<br/>happened? The thought was unbearable.<p>****<p>"Are the advanced parties armed and fully supplied?" asked General<br/>Marthalus. His iron-grey wings were still powerful, despite his<br/>advanced age, and the glint of steel that could occassionally be seen<br/>between his feathers indicated him as a master of the Raging Storm<br/>school of Phoenix Combat.<p>"Yes, sir. We have also recieved a shipment of herbs from the Amazons<br/>that will give out warriors extended stamina and endurance during<br/>battle. I took the liberty of having it rationed among the men, after<br/>proper testing, of course," Commander Berhid answered. Most of his<br/>body was covered by intricately worked armor fashioned from minute<br/>metal scales and the only weapons he wore came in the form of metal<br/>gauntlets that lent strength and power to his natural talons.<p>"Excellent. If at all possible, I would like to speak with the Musk<br/>and Amazon Commanders. I'm sure they would appreciate a chance to<br/>send their people along with ours. Their skills would greatly<br/>compliment our warriors. That is all," finished the general.<p>"Right away, sir."<p>****<p>"It has been decided," Cologne said to her heir."You will accompany<br/>the first squad of Amazon warriors that will travel with the Phoenix<br/>People." The Matriarch of the Joketsozuko Amazons led her great-<br/>granddaughter to the building adjacent to the armory. This one held<br/>the magical artifacts and enchanted weapons collected over the<br/>millenia by the tribe.<p>Shampoo glanced across the room. Along the walls hung items of power<br/>that she couldn't even begin to control. Iron bound trunks and strong<br/>boxes held within them smaller, more valuable items and some even<br/>contained martial arts scrolls, the most valued treasure of the<br/>Amazons. Her eyes alighted on a particularly deadly looking sword.<br/>The light reflected from its razor sharp blade in a cascade of bright<br/>colors and an inner fire burnt within the hen egg-sized ruby attached<br/>to its hilt.<p>"Ah, I see you've noticed the contribution your young friend Ranma<br/>made to the tribe." The boy had been a powerful sorceror and martial<br/>artist and many of the tribe had set their sights on him almost as<br/>soon as he'd walked through the gates. Cologne had put a stop to<br/>those notions almost immediately. Ranma felt pure evil to her senses,<br/>and when attention was called to that fact, so to did the other elders<br/>notice. Cologne saw deeper though, as her three centuries of training<br/>allowed. Ranma's heart was pure, if slightly shadowed, and his evil<br/>prescence was nothing more than some kind of curse he wasn't even<br/>aware of.<p>"Aiyah, Ranma made this?" Shampoo asked in wonder. She'd sparred with<br/>the foreign boy a number of times and had hoped their relationship<br/>would go further, but the few times she had lured him to her bed<br/>hadn't been enough to keep him in the village.<p>"Yes, dear child. Ranma made that sword. It was part of a deal to<br/>instruct him in our deepest arts. I believe we came out the betters<br/>in the deal, but Ranma appeared satisfied." Cologne cackled. Not many<br/>within the tribe had any of the Gift for sorcery, and none of them<br/>could create an object nearly as powerful as the one before them.<br/>Trading it for a few advanced martial arts techniques that would go to<br/>the grave with their owner was a small price to pay.<p>"What does it do, great-grandmother?" She reached out to touch it,<br/>running her hand along the silver wire wrapped hilt.<p>"At it's user's command, the sword begins to give off enormous heat or<br/>equally massive amounts of chill. It only lasts for an hour before<br/>needing to recharge for a full day, but you can see the advantage a<br/>sword like this would be in battle, especially to a weilder versed in<br/>the Hiryu Shoten Ha and Soul of Ice." Cologne had tried the weapon out<br/>for herself, and with a little practice, had been able to create the<br/>cyclone without moving from where she stood.<p>"But that's not why we're here," she reminded the much younger woman.<br/>She walked over to a large trunk and opened it with a tap of her<br/>staff. It contained the more useful temporary curses that could be<br/>derived from boiled down Jusenkyo water. She grabbed a handful of the<br/>packets and moved on to another trunk. From this one she retrieved a<br/>wax encrusted bar of waterproofing soap.<p>"What am I to do with these, great-grandmother?" Shampoo asked in<br/>confusion as the ancient woman passed the materials up to her.<p>"Those will allow you to temporarily take the form of Phoenix People.<br/>Combined with the waterproofing soap, you and your fellow Amazons will<br/>be able to travel with our allies without slowing them down." Shampoo<br/>nodded her understanding."Good. Now on the way out, grab Ranma's<br/>sword. Tomorrow morning I will teach you how to properly harness its<br/>power."<p>Shampoo grinned in anticipation. Finally she would be going into<br/>battle.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: I know that Demon is getting big, and he's going to<br/>be levelling off in size now, I think. Anyone remember that episode<br/>of Pokemon with the giant Dragonite? That's about how big Demon is<br/>gonna be. Ranma and Ami are pretty much irrevocably linked now, so<br/>that's a done deal. Does anyone think I'm taking the Ryoga/Tendo girl<br/>bit a little to far? In the next few chapters the valley of Jusendo<br/>is going to be taking the world by storm, obviously aided by magic to<br/>some way avoid all the nasty technological weapons we have. C&amp;C<br/>welcom at dark_<p>
