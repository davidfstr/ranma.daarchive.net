</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 4<p>"Guys," Usagi squealed as she ran into the latest meeting of learn to<br/>be a sorceress,"you won't believe what happenned!"<p>Since no one appearred to want to take the cue, I asked,"What, oh what<br/>has happened?" in a voice as falsely interested as I could muster.<br/>Needless to say, Usagi thought I really cared.<p>"When I got home there was this really nice woman in a limo waiting<br/>for me. She says that she works for the Emperor of Japan! Isn't that<br/>great? She told me that all that stuff that happened last week was<br/>just a big misunderstanding. You know, when I was kidnapped? The<br/>government is going to give me lots and lots of money!" she exclaimed<br/>happily.<p>I could see that I wasn't the only person not completely thrilled by<br/>this development. I had used several different methods of concealing<br/>my route to and from the shrine to keep the other girls from being<br/>discovered. The government obviously knew of Usagi and I, but they<br/>could still have been in the dark about the other senshi. Now though,<br/>if they hadn't known before, they most likely would now.<p>"What else did they say?" I asked with deliberate calm.<p>"Ms. Tokaguwa, that's the woman's name, said that from now on they<br/>wouldn't bother us or anyone else like us. In fact..." And she went<br/>on to describe what her limited grasp of the situation would term a<br/>police force to fight demons and other evil supernatural bad guys.<br/>Those last few words were direct quotes, by the way.<p>"What about the rest of us?" Makoto asked."Don't we get money too?"<br/>Heh, could my little angels be getting greedy?<p>Usagi's face screwed up in puzzlement."Hold on, I'll go get her and<br/>you can ask her." And she ran back out of the shrine.<p>Well, so much for secret idenities. Usagi returned, escorting an<br/>attractive woman who looked nice and trustworthy but gave off some bad<br/>vibes. Not 'I like to torture people' but something closer to 'I like<br/>to watch people be tortured'. As long as she didn't bother me, I<br/>couldn't care less.<p>"I'm sure you girls will be compensated just like young Usagi here,"<br/>Ms. Tokoguwa assured us. I'm not about to turn down free money.<p>"I'll take mine in cash," I said. The woman agreed much too readily<br/>to my snide demand. People in positions of power like hers don't<br/>normally take that kind of treatment very easily. Something was up.<br/>I sat back and listened as all the girls were assured by Tokoguwa that<br/>they would be treated with the respect they deserved and all that<br/>crap. I didn't interrupt for fear of being stoned. They weren't<br/>exactly greedy, just damned close.<p>Once we were alone again, I told them,"When something appears too good<br/>to be true, it normally is." I didn't say anything else on the matter.<br/>With the exeption of Usagi(again), they all seemed to get the gist<br/>after a moment of thought.<p>****<p>"Not that I don't appreciate everything," Ami said one night a few<br/>weeks later,"but don't you think a spell that slowly freezes a<br/>person's brain over a period of months is just a little...evil?"<br/>Despite her reservations over learning it, she had knocked it away no<br/>problem.<p>"Yeah, I guess. I learned it from this ice nymph that had gotten<br/>dumped by her human lover. She made it extra special just for him.<br/>Even if you never use what I teach you, Ami, the more you know the<br/>better equipped you'll be in the future to handle unusual situations.<br/>One day you may feel like freezing someone's brain, who knows?" Not<br/>that those were adequate explanations for a very painful and<br/>debilitating way to die. Ami seemed to except them, though, so I'll<br/>leave it at that.<p>Later, out of nowhere, Ami informed me,"Luna and Artemis don't trust<br/>you. They think you've killed Sailor Pluto and are trying to corrupt<br/>us." I probably shouldn't have left the furballs behind when we went<br/>to rescue Usagi. Setsuna's tongue was a bit too swollen for it to<br/>work properly. Neither of which were my concerns, except for the<br/>swollen tongue being my fault.<p>"Why are you telling me this?" I asked, honestly dumbfounded by the<br/>confession. I was also worried. I hadn't felt a lessening in the<br/>ring's enchantment, but those cat's could be more sensitive to that<br/>type of magic than me.<p>"Well, you do seem pretty cynical, and not really nice most of the<br/>time." Ami answered."I don't think you're trying to corrupt us,<br/>though, because I know that we're not a threat to you, so what'd be<br/>the point? You could have killed us at your convenience. And Setsuna<br/>has gone months without talking to us. No, the cats just don't like<br/>you for some reason." An adequately accurate analysis.<p>"Thanks," I said dryly causing her to blush."Do you think that they'll<br/>try to turn the rest of the senshi against me?" That would result in a<br/>case of stir fried kitty cat.<p>She shook her head."No. If you have Pluto's support, they'll stay out<br/>of your business as long as you don't endanger Crystal Tokyo. If<br/>anything, your teaching us magic helps to ensure its creation." This<br/>was new to me.<p>I asked,"What's Crystal Tokyo?" I was thinking a moon cult or<br/>something. Maybe try to get back to their Silver Millenium roots and<br/>all that.<p>"Setsuna didn't tell you?" I shook my head."Oh. Well, it's the<br/>reestablishment of the Old Moon Kingdom on Earth with the Prince and<br/>Princess becoming the rulers of Crystal Tokyo, the capital city in the<br/>future."<p>"Is Setsuna the Princess? Who's the Prince?" This really blew. I<br/>don't want to live in a utopian society like the Silver Millenium.<br/>Not that peace on Earth and good will towards man isn't a good thing,<br/>I just don't want everything to be perfect. Where would the fun be in<br/>that?<p>"Usagi is the reincarnated daughter of Queen Serenity of the Moon<br/>Kingdom and Mamoru is the reincarnated Prince of Earth..." she trailed<br/>off when she saw the unbridled horror in my eyes."Are you all right,<br/>Ranma? Do you need to lie down?"<p>Good Lord, what was Setsuna thinking? It took a minute to get the<br/>uncontrollable trembling under control."Ami, please tell me that this<br/>is all some elaborate practical joke. Usagi isn't really going to be<br/>in charge of the WHOLE planet, is she?" There was still hope if this<br/>Mamoru guy wasn't a total blockhead. I didn't have much hope.<p>Ami nodded and I fought down the urge to cry."Where's Mamoru?" I asked<br/>desperately. That little bit of hope I mentioned, it was in serious<br/>jeopardy of withering up and turning to dust.<p>She shrugged."He sorta took a trip to America and broke off contact<br/>with Usagi. He said he needed some space." Yeah, Usagi did seem like<br/>the smothering type."With the problems in America now, we don't know<br/>how he's doing." Heh, Bill Gates had really screwed that place up.<br/>Might be a nice place to spend a few weeks relaxing.<p>I sighed."No offense, but I have all intentions of leaving this planet<br/>if Usagi ever comes into power." I can't see how that could possibly<br/>happen, even with Setsuna manipulating things. That's it! Setsuna<br/>plans on running things from behind the scenes!<p>Ami frowned at me, her brow scrunching up cutely. Gah, I really need<br/>to get some soon."Usagi isn't as bad as you make her out to be, Ranma.<br/>She can't help it if she's clumsy and a bit flighty. Setsuna assures<br/>us that she'll grow out of it." Setsuna again. The senshi trusted her<br/>way too much. Good thing she's out of the picture for a while.<p>I acted apologetic, saying,"Maybe, maybe not." To change the subject,<br/>I asked,"Wanna try to squeeze that flight spell in before you go<br/>home?"<p>****<p>"Damnit, old man!" Ryoga shouted."I am not going to pretend I'm<br/>Ranma!" He turned to leave but was hit in the back by a small car. He<br/>picked himself up off the street with much more grace than anyone hit<br/>by a giant chunk of metal has any right to do.<p>"I taught you the forbidden techniques, boy!" Genma roared."Now you<br/>have to fulfill your part of the bargain!" He would have to be<br/>careful. Ryoga was behaving even more erratically since they had been<br/>caught by those people with lightning guns.<p>"Those forbidden techniques that were supposed to be able to let me<br/>defeat Ranma couldn't even break us out of one little cage," Ryoga<br/>snapped, dusting his tunic off and glaring at the older man. His<br/>umbrella was held at his side and had begun to glow a malevoelent<br/>yellow.<p>"It wasn't a cage, you idiot! We were trapped in some kind of energy<br/>barrier. I didn't create the umi-senken and yama-senken to combat<br/>things like that. Ranma is made of flesh and blood. He'll go down<br/>just like any other person."<p>"So how come you haven't beaten him already and forced him to marry a<br/>Tendo?" Ryoga demanded.<p>"I may be stubborn but I know when I'm outclassed," Genma responded<br/>bitterly."My son was trained by the Master," shudder,"and kamis know<br/>what else. The last time I fought him I was in the hospital for three<br/>months and it took me another month after that to pee without sitting<br/>down. I 'know' what the boy is capable of and I 'know' that you can<br/>beat him." Genma knew no such thing. Ryoga was simply gullible enough<br/>to believe it."I'm an old, fat man well past his prime. Your stronger<br/>and tougher than a tank. That combined with the secret techniques<br/>means you can't lose!"<p>Ryoga's rage quickly fled, a mental condition that really needed<br/>looking into, Genma thought."Are you sure?"<p>Genma smiled and said,"Sure, would I lie to you?"<p>****<p>I was still having problems accepting Usagi as future ruler of the<br/>world. I could have killed her, but that would have been a complete<br/>violation of the pact between Setsuna and I and the things she could<br/>do to me through such a connection would make my little joke curses on<br/>her look like child's play. I had started looking for alternate<br/>planes of existance similar to Earth last month. Now I was making a<br/>point of spending at least an hour every night in search of a suitable<br/>home.<p>"No, no, no. If you do it that way Usagi you'll make you arm melt," I<br/>chided Usagi gently. I'd learned that any firmer tone than that would<br/>make the girl cry."You have to form the proper image in your mind, not<br/>just push the energy into your hand, here I'll show you-" The arrival<br/>of Grandfather Hino and his announcement cut me off.<p>"Sorry to intrude, children, I just thought you should know that there<br/>is a giant robot rampaging through downtown Tokyo. Back to chores,"<br/>he said and scampered back inside.<p>"We have to do something!" Usagi shouted. I'd bet my left arm that<br/>she was worried about the malls.<p>"Don't look at me," I said when I noticed four pairs of eyes turned in<br/>my direction."The fighting crime and evil bit is your jobs. I'm just<br/>along for the ride." Times like this I think back to when I agreed to<br/>take this job and I wish I could reach back two months and smack<br/>myself.<p>"We're the Sailor Senshi for a reason," Rei stated vehemently."Some<br/>stupid robot can't stop us. Let's go!" Yay, yippee, and all that. At<br/>least she didn't make a stupid speech. Saving it for the robot, I'd<br/>say, not that a robot would care.<p>"I have a suggestion," I volunteered."Unless you want there to be a<br/>lot of smashed building and dead people, you might want to try to fly<br/>there instead of running or taking the bus. A couple of you should<br/>carry Usagi." Now I know why she had those wings on her last costume;<br/>she's completely hopeless with a flight spell. We'll just ignore the<br/>fact that I was acting like a leader here. Thanks.<p>****<p>Mysterious Background Music:<p>:Go Go Bible Rangers, Mighty Praying Bible Rangers!:<p>"Form Mecha Jesus!" shouted the Turquoise Bible Ranger."That creature<br/>is a work of Satan and must be destroyed!"<p>"Praise Mecha Jesus! Divine Left Leg of Smiting is go!" proclaimed<br/>the Marroon Bible Ranger.<p>"May Mecha Jesus guide us in the cleansing light of his death rays!<br/>Right Leg of Holy Wrath ready!" The Purple Bible Ranger turned on her<br/>stereo and started listening to Christian rock. The external speakers<br/>broadcast the horrible sound to the evil robot and made it scream in<br/>pain.<p>"Lick the balls of Mecha Jesus, um, oh shit, forget I said that! God<br/>is good, yeah, God is good, that's what I meant to say! Left Arm of<br/>Supreme Ass Kicking powered up." Reformed Crackhead Bob, also known as<br/>the Magenta Bible Ranger said.<p>"The Word of Mecha Jesus is law! Right Arm of Gay Bashing fully<br/>Operational!" said the Rust Bible Ranger.<p>"And I'll form the head!" Shouted the Beige Bible Ranger.<p>Then they said in use,"Mecha Jesus is go!"<p>(Yeah, yeah, it's stupid and blasphemous and really dumb and done in<br/>bad taste. I like it. I might have the Bible Rangers make other<br/>guest appearances later on in the series, never know though.)<p>****<p>We got to the area where the robot was last reported being seen and<br/>found nothing but a twitching pile of semi-melted chunks of metal that<br/>had once possibly been an giant evil robot. Then again, it could have<br/>been an exploded alien space ship or a lot of buses all stacked in a<br/>pile and stomped on by the All Mighty. I'm going with the giant evil<br/>robot theory though.<p>Littered all over the ground were small pamplets stating the glories<br/>of God and following in His light. They also had an explicit threat<br/>to all evil doers(exact words) that the Bible Rangers and Mecha Jesus<br/>would destroy then if they went against the Christian way printed on<br/>the back. I didn't know whether I was dreaming or stuck in a really<br/>bad Gojiro(Godzilla in Japan, right?) movie until I heard a group of<br/>eye witnesses talking about a giant robot wearing a robe beating the<br/>other giant robot to death with a giant book. They went on to say how<br/>they would be going to church from now on. I just tuned them out.<p>"Looks like you ladies have some competition and they're spreading the<br/>word," grin,"against evil." Before Usagi could get into another<br/>session of 'isn't that great', I said,"Of course these new ones<br/>probably don't like anyone who uses magic, seeing as how the bible<br/>says witches are bad and that they should die. I've read that they're<br/>were a bunch of witch burnings in Europe and America a couple of<br/>centuries ago. Heh, the Bible Rangers," and I had to add just a tiny<br/>bit of scorn into it,"might be thinking about reviving the old<br/>practices." Good old Usagi started to gnaw on her gauntleted fingers<br/>nails.<p>****<p>'And in further news, The Wizard of Gates, conqueror of the United<br/>States of America, has announced his plans to turn Mexico into a theme<br/>park. When contacted, the President of Mexico was unavailable for an<br/>interview, but we at CNN's Tokyo branch have exclusive information<br/>that places Mr. Santiago(I have absolutely no clue who the President<br/>of Mexico is, sorry) in Brazil. Experts believe he has gone into hid-<p>I turned the tv off and flipped out of the couch. My life is sooo<br/>boring. I sleep, eat, play nursemaid, eat, teach, sleep, and the<br/>cycle continues. Will it ever change? Not likely. Hell, as far as I<br/>can see, everything is just gonna keep getting worse. Even further<br/>worsening Setsuna's state of existance isn't really fun anymore. I'm<br/>just keeping the current curses I placed on her active out of spite.<p>Seems that there are a few more senshi that no one deigned to mention<br/>to me earlier. Good ole Ami finally mentioned it in passing, thinking<br/>that I already knew. I'd actually heard of the Senshi of Saturn, at<br/>least through obscure references in some really ancient tomes and even<br/>on a sanscrit tablet an old possessed woman let me see once. The<br/>Bringer of Silence, real hero down in hell. Not silence the concept,<br/>but Silence the demon kami of destruction. The Silver Millenium must<br/>have had some real heavy hitters to leash an entity that powerful. I<br/>chose not to inform anyone that little Hotaru probably didn't have<br/>long to live. No one can remain in contact soul-to-soul with that<br/>much force without fading away.<p>I'm really glad they were off racing in Europe or wherever it is that<br/>people care about that crap. From what Ami told me, Neptune and<br/>Uranus weren't the kinds of people I got along with.<p>Ami was turning out better than expected. Even with her affinity<br/>based handicap, she was beginning to grasp the concept of other spell<br/>types. It'd be years before she's anywhere near as good with them as<br/>she already is with water and ice, but those of us with the gift for<br/>magic don't really age all that much. She has plenty of time.<p>****<p>"Ranma, I tried that internal viewing spell you showed me last week on<br/>Usagi," Ami confided worriedly."She has some kind of blockage in her<br/>brain. I don't know what it is, I'm not profficient enough with the<br/>spell to tell. I know it's harmful though." Her eyes were red-rimmed<br/>and bloodshot. She must have really been worried.<p>I almost joked about the girl having a brain tumor and that being why<br/>she's such a dingbat. Then I thought about it and decided not many<br/>people besides myself would find that funny instead of really mean.<br/>And, possibly, the thing really could be why Usagi was so stupid."I'll<br/>check it out tomorrow. There's nothing I can do for her tonight. Do<br/>you feel up to learning tonight?" Hey, I'm not entirely unsympathetic.<br/>I knew this guy once who had a tumor growing on the end of his dick.<br/>I felt really sorry for him and his wasn't even life threatening.<br/>Ami's friend could be dying, the least she deserved was a little<br/>kindness.<p>"Yeah, I can manage."<p>****<p>"I'll be damned!" I exclaimed. That thing in Usagi's head wasnt a<br/>tumor at all. It was the most complex magical ward I had ever<br/>encountered. I'm talking MAJOR. It had to be divine in origin. I<br/>wasn't about to get any closer to it than I already was.<p>The moon cats were present for the little examination."What?" Luna<br/>asked impatiently."Did she suck a cherry up there? I always warned<br/>her about eating so fast."<p>"Lady," I said to the cat,"I don't know why that was put in there. I<br/>don't care, really, it's none of my business. And I am not going to<br/>try to take it out." You don't mess with these kinds of things. They<br/>sorta have an astral no trespassing sign on them. Just looking at it<br/>made my hair stand on end as if I were about to be struck by<br/>lightning.<p>"What is 'it'?" Artemis demanded. He sounded more worried than angry.<br/>His fear was echoed in the appearances of the other senshi.<p>"'It' is a block or ward put in her brain by the All Mighty, you know<br/>the big guy upstairs? I don't feel like getting blasted out of<br/>existance so I'm just going to pretend like I didn't see it and go on<br/>with my life." Shit, they were looking stubborn.<p>"We can't just leave it in there," Makoto said."If you won't try, we<br/>will. Just tell us what to do." Didn't even think about going to a<br/>doctor. Usagitess must be spreading.<p>"Do you not understand? There is no one in existance capable of<br/>removing that thing except for the guy who put it there. If you try<br/>to take it out or dissolve it, you get a one way ticket to meet the<br/>guy who put it there. I can't make it any plainer than that." I was<br/>about to pull Usagi out of her spell induced nap and get on with the<br/>lessons when Luna coughed.<p>"Does it have any particular shape?" she asked, sounding curious, and<br/>a little smug.<p>Shape? I hadn't really looked at it hard enough to determine it's<br/>exact shape. Why would I? It wouldn't hurt anything, though, so I<br/>said,"Rei, could you tilt her head back a little so her eyes aren't in<br/>the way?" Once my instructions were carried out I again altered my<br/>senses to see the energy flows within the girl's brain. I continued<br/>to sharpen the definition until I could see the sharp edges indicative<br/>of unbelievable power. It did have a sorta curvey hump thing going<br/>on."Turn it a little to the right and lean her forward some." Was it<br/>my imagination or was there a crescent moon shaped ward inside Usagi's<br/>brain? I looked closely then shifted my gaze to Luna and Artemis then<br/>back to Usagi.<p>"Someone want to tell me why she has a crescent moon up there?" I<br/>asked, tapping her forehead with my index finger.<p>"Ah ha!" Luna cheered, dancing a little jig. Don't ask. I wouldn't<br/>have believed it possible either. She eventually stopped dancing and<br/>began recieving completely blank stares from all of us, including<br/>Artemis. She coughed to clear her throat."Queen Serenity, Usagi's<br/>mother is Lord Kami's seventeenth removed granchild. He must have<br/>done this as a favor to Serenity during the reincarnation. He always<br/>was partial to her."<p>Wow. That explained the energy tolerance. I wish I had some of His<br/>blood. It's not fair."That's great. Now we know that Usagi is only<br/>slightly more divine than normal people. Does it matter? I'm sure as<br/>hell not summoning the Creator of reality to get the thing removed.<br/>He probably wouldn't like me too much." So I haven't been the nicest<br/>and most law abiding citizen.<p>"There's no need for that," Luna said confidently."If it is indeed a<br/>crescent like you say, it was specifically keyed into mine and<br/>Artemis' telepathic power, as limited as they are. My mind will act<br/>like a key."<p>It's her life. I for one decided to back away and wrap enough force<br/>around myself to bend space. I looked down as something brushed my<br/>feet.<p>"Mind if I wait in here with you?" Artemis asked."Luna may be<br/>confident in her abilities, but I'm not."<p>"Sure. Just don't try using me for a scratching post."<p>"Luna mind meld!" Luna shouted. A beam of yellow light shot out of<br/>her forehead and struck Usagi's.<p>"It's really called a Melmackian head lock," Artemis said."Luna is<br/>just a little," he held up a paw and rocked it side to side,"you<br/>know." I could believe it.<p>A bright, but not blindingly so, flash of light burst from Usagi's<br/>forehead. It took shape into a house sized crescent of almost solid<br/>energy and then blazed into space. For the record, that much energy,<br/>properly harnessed and placed within the proper spell pattern, could<br/>melt Japan. No wonder Usagi had problems.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: Yippee yay! No writer's block! I hereby proclaim it<br/>defeated. Okay, to the story. Will Usagi change? Maybe, maybe not.<br/>Still looking for suggestions. Going back to college soon! Need<br/>sleep. Yeah, I really need to go to sleep now. C&amp;C welcome at<br/>dark_<p>Later!<p>
