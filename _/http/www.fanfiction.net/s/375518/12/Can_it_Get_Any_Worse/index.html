</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 11<p>The large wooden double doors at the top of the wide steps swung open<br/>before we were halfway to the top. Soldiers in black and green<br/>uniforms armed with either shields and some kind of sidearm, a sword,<br/>axe, or mace, and others with crossbows poured out onto the steps<br/>ahead of us in double ranks. They formed a wall of men to block us,<br/>with shields held in interlocking positions on one level of steps and<br/>the crossbowmen a couple above it. Without our pokemon clearly<br/>visbile, it seemed that there was a little bit of courage floating<br/>around this place afterall.<p>The girls were behind me encase of a projectile attack, but as close<br/>together as the soldiers were, even if the steps were relatively wide,<br/>I planned on just hitting them with a extra large vaccum blade. The<br/>steps would be slippery with all the blood and other bodily fluids,<br/>none of it would be ours though.<p>"Halt!" was the simple command barked by a guy wearing the same<br/>uniform as his underlings, with the exception of a silver star over<br/>his heart. He stood in the doorway, well above what would soon be a<br/>massacre if his men attacked.<p>They obviously spoke Japanese, even though they looked European in<br/>origin. That's been another little mystery of this whole dimension<br/>hopping trip. This would be the second world, excluding the one with<br/>the space ship because they used some kind of implant to translate,<br/>that spoke Japanese. I would have previously said that the senshi and<br/>I would have been lucky just to run across a world that spoke a<br/>language as common to us as Swahili. Sigh. No point in complaining<br/>about fortuitous coincidences, I guess.<p>"Nah, I don't think so," I said in a voice as close to that of the<br/>man's as possible."We'll be needing to see whoever's in charge. Now."<br/>That came across with a kind of implied threat that had gotten me<br/>through the gates of Hell once.<p>Heh. He wasn't used to being disobeyed, that's for sure. Minako and<br/>Makoto snickering behind me probably contributed to the man's face<br/>becoming a mottled portrait of red and purple splotches. Talk about<br/>high blood pressure. Ami soon joined in. I think that Usagi was just<br/>too worried about whether or not the man's head was going to explode<br/>to make fun of him.<p>"Ah, damnit," I sighed. I wasn't in the mood for really getting<br/>violent and I could feel Ami's accusatory stare pressing against the<br/>back of my head."Go Slammer!" I cried, turning lose the large Golem.<br/>The steps shuddered under the fantastic weight of the compact, yet<br/>massive pokemon. Oh yeah, lots of running, screaming men. Pokedot<br/>face managed to stand his ground, though the large stain spreading<br/>across the front of his green pants sorta gave away his fear.<p>Pokemon, or something very much like pokemon, had really put the fear<br/>into these people. I was almost starting to feel sorry for them.<br/>Still, it was funny.<p>"Begone foul demon, I abjour thee!" Pisspants screamed, his voice<br/>trembling pathetically. He'd drawn his short sword, not that it would<br/>do much more than break against Slammer's shell/hide/armor, whatever<br/>the stuff was.<p>"Bwahahahahaha!" I roared, laughing almost uncontrollably. Slammer<br/>pounded on the ground and spit a couple rocks at Pisspants' feet.<br/>That broke the man. He ran screaming back into the building, not<br/>bothering to close the doors behind him. Slammer reluctantly returned<br/>to his pokeball. He was having fun. I really should let him have<br/>more time out.<p>"That wasn't very nice, Ranma," chided Usagi."He didn't look very<br/>healthy. What if you made him have a heart attack? If I was a<br/>doctor, I could tell you for sure, but I'm almost certain that his<br/>head was about to explode." Damn, I'm good! The other senshi had to<br/>turn away and start coughing to cover up their laughter.<p>"He was going make a fuss and I would have had to kill some people. I<br/>think Slammer and I did a pretty good job." Usagi had the grace to<br/>blush slightly."Well," I gestured to the open door,"shall we enter?"<p>****<p>The inside of the building was nice, in a stuffy, old way. Tapestries<br/>hung from the high ceilings, depicting the floating city hovering over<br/>various location, only one of them water. Most, though, showed men<br/>fighting hordes of ravening demons. I recognized most of the breeds,<br/>all of them in the lower echelons of the demonic heirarchy. None were<br/>particularly powerful, maybe a few times stronger than a normal man<br/>and occassionally armed with a few killing spells, but when looked at<br/>from the perspective of normal men with no magic to speak of, an army<br/>of them type can be intimidating.<p>The bottom floor was nothing but a single cavern like room, supported<br/>by marble columns. A spiral staircase rose to the next floor and<br/>above, wrapping around one of the marble colums.<p>"My pokemon do not look like any of those beasts!" Usagi loudly<br/>proclaimed. She was right, they really didn't. She stroked her<br/>pokeball belt. For a few delicate moments, I feared that she would<br/>unleash the beasts in the room. It's not a good idea to smash the<br/>support columns for a large, seven story stone structure.<p>"I know a guy who runs a hot dog shop in New York," I said, stabbing a<br/>finger at a short little demon with purple skin covered with pink<br/>patches of hair who weilded a war hammer nearly as big as he was,"who<br/>is really one of those. Makes great hot dogs. Heh, and you can be<br/>sure that they don't really have dog in them. His species go into<br/>convulsions when anything canine gets near them." Useless piece of<br/>information, I know, but I felt like saying it.<p>"Hmm, he's sort of cute," Rei commented. That goes to show just how<br/>bad her tastes are. I mean, look at the ugly monster rat of hers.<p>"Yeah, sure. Anyway, let's not stand around here." I didn't look back<br/>to see whether the girls were following me, I could feel their<br/>prescenses, and it's more effective being dramatic like that.<p>I was expecting some kind of landing or doorway leading off from where<br/>the second floor should be. There wasn't one. I would have been able<br/>to sense any hidden doorways. We kept on going. No third, forth,<br/>fifth, or sixth. The stairs topped off on the seventh floor. There<br/>must have been a back entrance to the other floors. Space in a<br/>walled, floating city had to be at a premium, it wouldn't be wasted so<br/>stupidly.<p>A brass railing surrounded the top of the stairs. The floor in<br/>question was a smaller, columnless version of the bottom floor. The<br/>tapestries were different, though, and it was furnished with a number<br/>of desks of varying quality, and sitting behind most of them were men<br/>in green, black, and purple robes. They looked up at me with little<br/>interest and went back to doing their jobs.<p>Pisspants was wildly gesturing, spittle flying from his mouth, to an<br/>older man with silver-gray hair and a wrinkled face worthy of the most<br/>worldly of prunes. The bare floor was polished to a mirror-like<br/>shine. It's a bit irritating to see yourself looking at yourself when<br/>you are trying to look serious and vaguely threatening. I managed,<br/>and amazingly, so did the senshi.<p>Mr. Wrinkley, it fits, waved Pisspants off with an imperious flick of<br/>his wrist, somehow getting his aged faced to look disbelieving. This<br/>didn't seem like the best place to pull out one of my pokemon. The<br/>floor probably wouldn't support Slammer or Gyrados and Demon couldn't<br/>squeeze into this confined space for all the pokemon on Pokeworld.<br/>The others had plenty of ugly pokemon if the need arose, though.<p>"Hey," I greeted politely. As politely as I ever get, at least."You<br/>must be the guy in charge. I'm Ranma." Pisspants seemed torn between<br/>attempting to murder me and rewatering his breeches.<p>"What are you?" Wrinkley asked."Mr. Dumas(love that commercial) here<br/>seems to think that you and your lady friends," and the bastard raked<br/>a lecherous stare across the senshi,"are demons in disguise as<br/>mortals." When his attention returned to my face, my eyes were<br/>burning with black and red fire. He swallowed heavily and pulled back<br/>in his heavily cushioned chair a little.<p>I always have been good at making lasting impressions. Just look at<br/>Setsuna. Anyone think she'll ever forget me?"I could say my friends<br/>and I, and I'll rip your heart out if you ever look at them like that<br/>again, are travellers from another universe. Though it is true, I<br/>doubt you would believe the story." Happosai's trick was working<br/>pretty good. Next step. The air around me darkened slightly, giving<br/>my features a shaded appearance."What matters to you and all the<br/>people in this city, is that the creatures we command are not demons,<br/>but beings from another plane more powerful than demons. If the need<br/>arose, we could bring down this puny little floating dirt ball. In<br/>return for not doing this, all we ask is help in restoring our energy<br/>to a level that would allow us to go home. The spells keeping this<br/>city afloat make that impossible. So, if the city were to explode,<br/>there would be no more spells and we could leave. If we get the<br/>needed help, no one has to die." I'm not the most terribly diplomatic<br/>of people, running more towards a terrible diplomat, really. I didn't<br/>want to make the head honcho shit himself, so I cut off the demon<br/>illusion.<p>A rustling of cloth and the scrap of chairs across stone alerted me to<br/>the mass evacuation of this floor. They weren't as indifferent as<br/>they had appeared. It couldn't have worked out better. Soon the<br/>whole city would know that I'd hijacked the boss' place.<p>"Cowards!" Dumas, and what a fucked up name that would be if this were<br/>an English speaking floating city, called to the escapees. His head<br/>really did look like it was about to explode.<p>"The, ah...terms, of your arrangement include help, you say?" I<br/>nodded."What kind of help would that be?" Old people simply weren't<br/>supposed to act this way. It was just too out of character. He was<br/>being obsequious and sounded more like he was trying to kiss my ass<br/>than save his own.<p>"I need to draw power from one of the spell constructs that levitate<br/>the city. Simple as that. I don't know how to do that without making<br/>it drop like a rock, though. If that's going to happen, why not just<br/>blow the place up now and get the trouble out of the way?" I paused,<br/>waiting for any objections. This wasn't as fun as I'd thought it<br/>would be. An amazon elder would have this guy for lunch."Someone has<br/>to mantain the constructs. They would know more about them than me.<br/>There could be alternatives to the first plan."<p>"And if there isn't anyone who can teach you to manipulate<br/>the...constructs...properly to send you home?" Only the barest hint of<br/>steel was present in the old guy's voice.<p>"Boom!" I chuckled as the horribly lined face went from grey to semi-<br/>transparent."My friends would probably hate me, with good reason, but<br/>they have important destinies on our world, save humanity and rebuild<br/>civilization kind of stuff. If they're trapped here, that isn't going<br/>to happen."<p>"Ranma..." growled Rei. I 'think' it was Rei, but the tone was so low<br/>that any of the senshi could have produced it.<p>"See?" I asked, gesturing behind me."They don't like this part of the<br/>plan. They don't have a choice, so don't get any hopes of subversion<br/>going." Just so you know, I'm bluffing.<p>"I believe that the constructs you refer to may be the Wings of God,<br/>our most holy objects. Their Caretakers are rather militant in their<br/>belief that only they should ever have contact with the Wings. I fear<br/>none of them would help you." Wrinkley wasn't lying. Damn.<p>"Well, you better get up off your scrawny little ass and find one that<br/>'will' help us, before the alternative becomes more attractive."<br/>Wrinkley didn't seem able to decide if he should stand or crawl, but<br/>finally decided his dignity couldn't take the beating it would recieve<br/>from his ego if he were to crawl away. Heh, I bet no one has told<br/>this guy what to do in years and years.<p>Once the old man reached the stairs and the sound of his slippered<br/>feet could no longer be heard, Usagi snapped,"Ranma, how could you be<br/>so mean to such an old man?" If blondey started acting like Rei the<br/>wonder bitch, I was going to find myself a nice set of ear plugs and<br/>nail them in place.<p>"I did get a little carried away, I admit. I did get the idea into<br/>his little old head, didn't I?" I took a seat on the edge of<br/>Wrinkley's desk.<p>Minako shivered, hugging herself."When he looked at me, I almost felt<br/>his slimey old hands grabbing me. Ugh." The senshi nodded in<br/>agreement, even Usagi who had sorta taken up for him.<p>"Usagi, why did you take up for him with Ranma if you felt so<br/>uncomfortable with his attitude and nature?" Ami asked. The straight-<br/>forward question forced Usagi to think about her answer more than she<br/>would have to a question from me meaning the same thing but voiced in<br/>different words.<p>"I guess he just looked so old and fragile, at first, then he 'looked'<br/>at us like that and I didn't really associate the two images, one of<br/>the old man, and the other of the perverted old man, as the whole<br/>image."<br/>! It's<br/>the end of existance!<p>Really, though, what the shit was up with Usagi? That answer had been<br/>inspired."Usagi," Rei asked, gently(yeah, wow),"did you hit your head<br/>and not tell us about it?"<p>"No, why?" Maybe there was some kind of time-release intelligence<br/>booster in that mind block we'd gotten rid of. There weren't any<br/>better explanations even worth pursuing.<p>Worried glances and resigned shrugs were exchanged.<p>****<p>The first three Caretakers that Wrinkley(never did learn his name)<br/>brought in weren't the religious fanatic types I had expected. The<br/>first didn't appear to have bathed in at least a decade, his beard was<br/>filthy, reaching almost to his waste, and a fist sized boil grew from<br/>his left cheek. You could literally see the thing throbbing! I had<br/>to break his arm when he tried to rape Minako right there on the<br/>floor. Women must have one screwed up place in this society, or these<br/>Caretaker freaks held lots of power.<p>After number one ran away bawling like a baby, Wrinkley escorted the<br/>second guy in. He at least knew how to use soap and kept any thoughts<br/>about messing with the senshi to himself. He kept his thoughts to<br/>himself right up until I asked him about recharging my energy. Then<br/>he wanted Rei as a sex slave. This was really getting aggravating. I<br/>didn't even have to hurt him, he ran away screaming when I started<br/>glowing. Rei's super rat may have contributed.<p>Number three was a nice old man who really wanted to help us.<br/>Unfortunately, he was a nice old man with bills to pay and wanted lots<br/>of gold. Since I didn't have lots of gold I didn't even have to scare<br/>him off.<p>"This isn't working," I said sourly to Wrinkley."Are there any of<br/>those bastards that aren't corrupt? Just one?" Wrinkley had built a<br/>small barrier of desks and books between himself and I, out of some<br/>hope it would protect him from me, I guess. Heh. I let him have his<br/>comfort.<p>Wrinkley spread his hands and looked apologetic."The Caretakers with<br/>the necessary political power to have even a chance at meeting your<br/>ultimatum are the corrupt ones." Then he started bowing to me.<br/>Respect is good. Even fear is good. Ass licking, brown nosing just<br/>isn't any fun.<p>I sighed."Well, find me a Caretaker with absolutely no political power<br/>who isn't a pervert and get his ass up here. No freaks, either!" I<br/>called to him as he scurried down the stairs. I almost felt sorry for<br/>all that running I was forcing the old man to do, but at his age<br/>exercise is a rather important activity...<p>Ami separated from the senshi, who were talking about various ways to<br/>make their pokemon hunt down the earlier Caretakers who had visited,<br/>and intercepted me while I paced from one end of the chamber to the<br/>other."You've got to relax, Ranma." She ran her hand down my back.<br/>That's really not fair."You're much too tense. We'll find someone to<br/>help us get home, I'm sure."<p>I allowed Ami to drag me over to a chair and seat me. Her small,<br/>delicately boned hands felt wonderful as they massaged the rigid<br/>muscles in my back into a semblance of normalcy. Ack, she's doing it<br/>again!<p>Ami chuckled lightly as I tensed, and I couldn't help but lean back<br/>and enjoy the treatment. Could she have heard my thought? I mentally<br/>shook my head. We were friends, lovers, companions, not a couple,<br/>though.<p>*Silly Ranma, what do you think a couple is?* laughed Ami's voice in<br/>my head. She squeaked in fright as I disappeared from the chair. Her<br/>head swivelled rapidly from side to side, seeking me out.<p>I was planted firmly in the upper corner where the two walls<br/>furtherest from the girl were. This was too much, too damned much!<br/>We couldn't be bonding on THAT level! As people, in form and spirit,<br/>we were too different. Hell(I guess that's a pun, sorta), I'm<br/>virtually assured reincarnation as an upper demon lord shall I ever<br/>die. Ami, well Ami fights for love and justice. The two just don't<br/>mix.<p>I stayed in my darkened corner for however long it took for Wrinkley<br/>to return. When I heard footsteps echoing from within the stairwell,<br/>I slipped from my perch and rushed to the seat I'd had when Wrinkley<br/>left. Ami was back with the senshi, looking a bit dejected, but I<br/>could feel the determination she held for something. Me.<p>The man Wrinkley led into the room was in his early-to-mid thirties,<br/>with an unremarkable face, crowned with muddy blond hair. His eyes<br/>were the same color blue as the robe he wore.<p>Wheezing and sweating profusely, Wrinkley managed to say,"This is<br/>Caretaker Telerin. He works as Keeper of the records at the Supreme<br/>Temple." He plopped down in a discarded chair."You asked for someone<br/>with no power and I found you one with so little that this chair<br/>outranks him."<p>Telerin didn't exactly turn a look of hatred onto Wrinkley, but it was<br/>damned close."You can leave us now, Chancillor." I think that was a<br/>title, not a name.<p>I briefly outlined the situation to Telerin and waited for his<br/>demands."Fascinating." That was a suprise."And you could recreate the<br/>Wings of God, the constructs as you term them?"<p>I shrugged."Now that I've seen the spell, sure, if I had enough of<br/>that crystal they're made from to work with. Why?" I allowed a<br/>glimmer of hope to wiggle it's way to the surface of my mind.<p>"As the Chancillor so eloquently stated, I have virtually no political<br/>power within the Caretaker organization. The reason for this isn't<br/>incompetence on my part, no, my opinions aren't held in high esteem by<br/>my fellow Caretakers. If you speak truly, my radical views could be<br/>confirmed." Telerin looked a little happy and significantly more<br/>hopeful than I.<p>"What radical views would those be?" I didn't wnat to get caught in<br/>some internal power struggle with a bunch of amazingly corrupt<br/>priests.<p>Telerin shrugged."There's nothing really radical about them. I simply<br/>do not believe that God created the Wings of God. I have found<br/>several references within our most ancient manuscripts that speak of<br/>people with awesome powers. They were called Magi'i, and you sound<br/>very much like one of them. I believe they created the Wings of God<br/>to give Chicago a means to escape constant demonic invasion."<p>Chicago? Oh goody, we could very likely be trapped in an alternate<br/>future within an alternate universe. But Chicago? When has Chicago<br/>ever had anything but Rust demons and Wind sprites? Then again,<br/>Chicago could have been the world capital of magic here."Well, then,<br/>will you help us? I may even be able to prove you right before this<br/>is all over."<p>****<p>Author's Notes: Any good ideas on a history to explain why Chicago is<br/>a floating medival city now? Am I moving too fast with Ami and Ranma?<br/>Need some help everyone. In other news, I have a mostly completed<br/>prologue to a Ranma/X-men crossover in the works. It may even be<br/>posted along with this. It's gonna be a kind of alternate universe<br/>that starts off with Ranma being twenty and married to Kasumi, but<br/>he's probably going to get dumped into the normal Ranma world. I just<br/>love those kinds of fics. Don't you? Until next...C&amp;C welcome at<br/>dark_<p>P.S.- I don't have a website. I've never made one before and don't<br/>have the slightest clue how to do a decent one. Any suggestions would<br/>be helpful. You know, what programs to use, what site provider is the<br/>most reliable, that kind of thing.<p>
