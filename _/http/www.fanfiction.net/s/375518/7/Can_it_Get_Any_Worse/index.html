</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 6<p>Within hours of setting out the next morning, we found, at last, a<br/>destination. The city sat behind massive walls of the same type stone<br/>and construction of the road. Ninety meters high and half that thick,<br/>I couldn't help but be impressed by the work. The city itself was<br/>huge. The buildings were all low to the ground and constructed of a<br/>single color of stone. When viewed from above, the buildings took on<br/>the same pattern of organization as in the road. Oh yeah, there<br/>wasn't anyone living in the place. There could have been people, or<br/>six tencacled clams or whatever passed for intelligent life on this<br/>planet hiding somewhere, but I didn't see any signs of them.<br/>Windblown dust had gathered in corners and between buildings,<br/>suggesting significant age.<p>"Did we scare all the people away?" Usagi asked sadly. I shook my<br/>head. I was still feeling a little sorry for Usagi after last night's<br/>unfortunate incident and I didn't want to make her cry by rebuking<br/>her.<p>"Look around," I said once Usagi's attention was focussed<br/>elsewhere."No one has lived here in a long time." Besides the dust,<br/>though, there was no debris or litter. There was nothing except<br/>stone. Wooden window casements in some of the dwellings we passed had<br/>rotted away to nothing. I wouldn't even have known that any had ever<br/>existed there if not for Ami pointing it out. That little computer of<br/>hers has to be magically augmented, I just don't know how.<p>"This is a nice place," Makoto said after we had walked into a sizable<br/>square with a still functioning fountain that sprayed a fine mist into<br/>the air."Why would anybody abandon it?"<p>"Who knows?" I shrugged."A plague could have killed off the<br/>inhabitants ten thousand years ago or they could have decided that<br/>living in such a colorful place was aggravating. We'll never know." I<br/>didn't feel any magical agent at work, so how could the stone this<br/>city was composed of have escaped the relentless erosion of nature,<br/>especially a place so close to an ocean that would bring in frequent<br/>storms and a steady and continuous salt spray to further speed<br/>destruction?<p>"Then I," and Usagi did a little semi-speech,"shall claim this the<br/>City of Usagi!" She raised her arm and swirled it around, collecting<br/>energy and forming it into an extremely skillful construct. It was<br/>well done, the flag of silver with her picture on it, though not<br/>really suited to my tastes.<p>I watched, with the senshi as witnesses, as Usagi flew to the top of<br/>the highest structure and planted her flag. The silver fabric caught<br/>a nonexistant wind and unfurled completely, giving off a radiant glow.<br/>"Maybe it's something in the air," Minako supplied to the silence of<br/>big eyes and giant sweat drops.<p>"What do you think?" Usagi asked, streamers of pure happiness twirling<br/>around her. Sometimes there can be such a thing as too Good.<p>"Uh, it's great, Usagi," I replied."What made you think of such a<br/>wonderful name?" Everyone else just nodded along with me.<p>The girl shrugged and smiled."It just felt right." She shivered."I<br/>just couldn't stand for such a pretty place to be so lonely and<br/>abandoned." As long as she didn't try to clean it up and make all nice<br/>and shiny, I couldn't care less what she called it.<p>"The next one is mine," Rei snapped, irritable that she hadn't thought<br/>of claiming the city first. Those two have a really weird love-hate<br/>relationship, kinda like the one my mom had with the old bastard, but<br/>without the sex.<p>All the senshi, even Ami, then called dibs on who would name what.<br/>Poor Minako looked like a sulky little kid when she found out everyone<br/>was ahead of her. Ha, watch this."You all have your fun. If we don't<br/>find anyone to tell us otherwise, I'm claiming and naming this<br/>planet." Ha ha ha."Ranma has a nice ring to it, don't you think?" The<br/>choking noises made by Rei and Makoto were worth letting myself get<br/>caught up in the small lapse into silliness.<p>****<p>Ami and I were the only ones who had decided not to go explore the<br/>city in more detail. We were sitting outside the wall at a small fire<br/>and eating berries from a big leaf I had wrapped them in. There<br/>weren't any wombats around and I didn't feel like hunting much.<p>"Ranma, if the whole planet is like Usagi's city, we're screwed," Ami<br/>said around a mouthful of berries. I congratulated myself on getting<br/>Ami to say 'screwed' within a normal conversation. A little time and<br/>I could maybe get a few curse words worked into the senshis'<br/>vocabulary.<p>"Yep," I agreed."Of course I get to be Emperor of Ranma, then." Ami<br/>smiled worriedly. Heh."Really though, if it comes down to the wire,<br/>and I can't find what we need, I can just tear a hole into another<br/>universe." My crystal and I can do that, for the record. Not me<br/>alone. No one has that much power, even Silence and Saturn."That<br/>would destroy this planet. That's a last resort measure, though,<br/>because we could end up somewhere worse. I'm on good terms with the<br/>inhabitants in the Hell of our universe, destroying an entire sentient<br/>species by accident though," I shook my head,"Would get me personal<br/>attention from the Prince of Hell himself."<p>Ami was staring at me when I looked up to get some more berries."You<br/>mean you've really been to hell?" she asked disbelievingly."I thought<br/>all those references were just jokes."<p>"No really, I have. It's not a bad place to visit, a little warm for<br/>my tastes, but nice, in a...red sort of way. The Dark Prince isn't a<br/>bad guy, he just got stuck with a crappy father." I've had my fair<br/>share of bad parenting, so I know.<p>"But the...tormenting of lost souls...and eternal damnation..."<p>I waved that off."Hell isn't what people think it is. You have to do<br/>something 'really' bad to go to hell. Trust me, if you're there, you<br/>deserve it. I was just babysitting Nicky, so I'm the exception."<br/>Nicky's a nice kid. Too bad his brothers hit him with that shovel.<p>"Who's Nicky?" Ami sounded resigned, like she just couldn't help but<br/>believe me.<p>"The Dark Prince's youngest son. He's a bit on the goofy side, not<br/>really Prince of Hell material. I've heard that his mother was a<br/>goat, so you can't really expect much." The berries slowly dwindled<br/>away in the silence. I hope the other girls can find themselves<br/>something to eat or their going to throw a fit."Ever hear of Hitler?"<br/>Stupid question, I know. I told her about his twice daily anal<br/>pineapple rape and had her cracking up pretty good by the time the<br/>girls came back, a monstrous watermelon held between them.<p>"Look what we found!" Usagi exclaimed. That was a big damned<br/>watermelon. We made a feast of it, sporadically interrupred by a<br/>shootout between Rei and Usagi with peach pit sized seeds. I showed<br/>my little group of girl scouts how to remove the moisture from thin<br/>slices of the melon, producing a huge quantity of dried watermelon<br/>chips. I didn't ask Usagi why she carried garbage bags in her purse,<br/>it seemed like a waste of breathe. No more picking berries for a<br/>while.<p>****<p>Weeks later, with no other sign of civilization besides the Road and<br/>Usagi's city, I started to get worried. My companions and I were all<br/>in relatively good spirits, though for how long I couldn't guess. I<br/>'m really thinking about getting rid of this damned ring and letting<br/>the senshi know who I really am. It's not like they could destroy me,<br/>and I'm the only one with the know how and power to get us<br/>home...Truth is, I'm really horny. I could probably have seduced Ami<br/>in my girl form, I just think she swings that way for some reason, but<br/>that would make things way too awkward and I'd much rather be a guy<br/>for the occassion.<p>I'd continued instructing the senshi in the arcane art and was<br/>pleasantly suprised that the higher energy levels of Ranma world(has a<br/>nice ring to it) made learning spell patterns easier for some reason.<br/>Ami knew, if knot well enough to properly use, all of the ice and<br/>water based spells that I did. She was getting completely separate<br/>lessons from Usagi in white magic and myself in the darker aspects.<br/>Rei and Makoto were far enough along with their studies to help each<br/>other witht the more difficult heat/electricity spells that were most<br/>familiar. Minako consistently insisted that her's was the power of<br/>love and I couldn't really make her understand that most of her magic<br/>was centered around high energy plasma.<p>****<p>"What are those?" I asked Minako and Makoto as we sat in the cave I<br/>had found. Night had fallen and everyone was relaxing. They were<br/>playing some kind of card game. I couldn't see well into there little<br/>corner of the cave because of the shadows cast by the light spheres<br/>they were using. I didn't want to play, I have the worst poker face<br/>ever, I was curious and bored.<p>"Pokemon cards," they answered simultaneously. The duo took turns<br/>describing the layout of the game. I nodded and said yes and no<br/>whenver appropriate, but my attention wasn't really with them. I was<br/>busy discreetly watching Rei give herself a sponge bath. I wanted to<br/>cry. It's all so unfair. When they finished, I made my escape into<br/>the cool night.<p>I climbed to the top of the rockoutcropping that housed the cave and<br/>slipped the ring off, feeling the instant change from male to female.<br/>If I hadn't accepted this thing, I would not have had a way to truly<br/>hide from devil hunters, then again, I would be somewhere now having<br/>fun doing 'something' or someone.<p>If I hadn't been so wrapped up in my own problems, I would have heard<br/>or sensed Ami's approach. When her head popped up over the rim of<br/>slightly flattened ledge made by the jutting rock, I froze, unable to<br/>move or think. Well, the secret was out, I guess.<p>She continued to climb, unaware of my appearance. It wasn't until she<br/>was almost all the way up when she began," Ranma, I-" and a cloud<br/>moved just enough to bathe me in moonlight. She, too, froze. I<br/>thought she would fall, but she powered up a flight spell and floated<br/>over the rim and to her feet. Hmm, why wasn't she screaming and<br/>trying to blast me?"R-Ranma, what are y-you doing? Is that an<br/>illusion?" She didn't come any closer and I could sense the building<br/>of defensive barriers around her.<p>"No Ami, this isn't an illusion. This is my true form." I quickly<br/>slipped the ring on and changed back into a girl."This is just an<br/>altered state." At least I had managed to speak.<p>"But, but Luna said that you were evil all those months ago...and then<br/>you showed up as a girl..." Things must have started to add up in her<br/>head.<p>"Luna was wrong about me being evil," I informed her heatedly. Damned<br/>furball."I just have a demonic presensce."<p>"That's why you hate Setsuna so much, isn't it? She tricked you into<br/>teaching us and you had to honor the agreement, but you couldn't do it<br/>in your true form, so she gave you the ring. You didn't know it would<br/>make you a girl, then?" Wow, she inferred most of it out of that one<br/>little piece of info. Good girl.<p>"That's mostly right. The agreement was to teach the senshi so that I<br/>could have the ring. It was supposed to mask my presensce so that<br/>devil hunters would leave me alone. They've bothered me for years,<br/>you see. Sailor Pluto didn't feel like telling me that it would have<br/>to change my gender to be effective." That reminded me that with me<br/>out of the same general area as Setsuna, the power to all the curses I<br/>had stuck her with would be gone. They had probably all faded away by<br/>now. Shit.<p>Ami didn't speak right away. I remained silent as she walked up to me<br/>and sat down."I won't tell the others. I think you would be suprised<br/>if you did. Luna has been wrong before. The others are open minded<br/>and genuinely think of you as a friend, they'd accept you without much<br/>trouble, I'm sure." She sounded like she believed what she was saying.<br/>I didn't.<p>I chuckled and said,"You forget that I'm really a guy and that I've<br/>seen you all naked A LOT and listened to you talk about nipples and<br/>stuff. I'm not sure if it wasn't a punishment more than a pleasure.<br/>I don't think most girls would see it that way, though." I did have to<br/>sleep, afterall, and all kinds of bad things can happen to a person's<br/>resting mind and body.<p>"It's up to you. Your secret is safe with me," assured Ami."And I<br/>don't know about you," she said shyly, in a whisper,"but I liked it<br/>when you saw me nude."<p>Alarm bells and all kinds of flashing lights were going off in my<br/>head. I wasn't entirely sure whether Ami was squeezing my crotch<br/>either. This wasn't supposed to happen, not with Ami. I could see<br/>Minako, the future slut, making a move like this, but not AMI! I was<br/>suprised, not stunned into inaction. I switched back to my true form<br/>and saw that Ami didn't take exception to it. Yay!<p>****<p>Insert Lemon scene here. I can't write them seriously whenever I try,<br/>so make use of your imagination until I can get someone to do one for<br/>me.<p>****<p>It's amazing the amount of tension one can relieve through sex. When<br/>you've gone months without it while being in a highly sexual(from a<br/>guy's perspective) situation, you feel like a totally different<br/>person. I didn't even let myself notice all the knowing looks I was<br/>getting from the senshi, even Usagi. Ami was a real screamer.<p>Isn't today a great day? All sunny and breezy, not a hint of a cloud<br/>in the sky, a giant spaceship slowly descending to the ground. I<br/>rubbed my eyes and shook my head. Yep, still there.<p>"Look alive, girls!" I shouted back towards the cave. The senshi<br/>scrambled into the clearing in full battle regalia. I didn't need to<br/>point out the ship.<p>"Do you think this is their planet?" Usagi asked."They can't have my<br/>city!" She looked ready to blast the ship.<p>"It doesn't matter if it is," I heard Ami reply."If they're friendly,<br/>anyone with the ability to build a ship that size could get Ranma the<br/>supllies he needs to find home." I turned and winked at the Senshi of<br/>Mercury, causing her to blush rosily.<p>The ship was too close for comfort by now and a deep humming whine<br/>filled the air. The thing was going to set down right in front of us.<br/>The closer it got the easier it got to appreciate the true magnitude<br/>of the ship. It was shaped like a giant saucer with a sharply curving<br/>protrusion flowing downward, from which were attached to uprising<br/>tubes that glowed with energy.<p>"Look," Rei pointed."There are words on it! In English!" She was<br/>right. It read U.S.S. Enterprise.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: It's shorter than normal, I know, but if I ever get a<br/>good lemon scene for Ranma and Ami, it'll fill out pretty good. No,<br/>this isn't going to be a Star Trek crossover, just a kind of guest<br/>appearance. I'm thinking of having a 'Crossover Crisis' like romp<br/>through various anime universes. I still haven't decided. C&amp;C<br/>welcome at dark_<p>
