</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 18<p>After the senshis' outburst, I began to do some damage control."Don't<br/>look at me like that. I'm serious. Someone with some serious magic<br/>power is going to be making a bid for global domination in..." I<br/>looked to Mousse.<p>"Two weeks," he added helpfully.<p>"In two weeks. He's gonna be able to kill the world's technology with<br/>some kind of ancient spell or something. If we get in on this, once<br/>the world is really conquered, with lots of oppression and all the<br/>other crap associated with someone getting their ass kicked, we can<br/>come in with pokemon and magic blazing, take over for ourselves, and<br/>put Usagi in power. But the clincher is that we make it look like<br/>Usagi is liberating the world from the bad guys. That way you come<br/>into power centuries before you're supposed to and all of Setsuna's<br/>plans get screwed as a side bonus." I think I presented the case<br/>rather well.<p>Katya laughed."Oh I just love you," she said fondly, earning a glare<br/>from Ami. That comment was just the right catalyst to get things<br/>moving in the proper direction.<p>"Who is going to try to take over the world, Ranma?" Ami asked."And<br/>how is he going to 'kill' the world's technology?" This couldn't have<br/>gone better if it had been scripted.<p>"A phoenix, a kind of really strong fire elemental really, over in<br/>China who has the backing of the most powerful martial artists and<br/>naturally powerful people in the world. I wouldn't say he's actually<br/>gonna kill technology. From what Mousse says, Saffron has found some<br/>really old artifact, probably from the Silver Millenium now that I<br/>think about it, and that it will render all modern technology and<br/>weapons useless." Now all I needed was for someone to ask why we<br/>shouldn't fight against Saffron and try to stop him from disabling<br/>technology.<p>Rei was kind enough to do that for me, and I didn't even have to ask.<br/>Heh."Simple. Once Saffron is eliminated, Usagi, and the rest of us,<br/>will have our very own army of super warriors. That can come in handy<br/>for all kinds of things. I know with absolute certainty that about<br/>eighty-five years from now this planet is going to be invaded by an<br/>army of demons, demons that don't like me anymore than they do any<br/>other human. Well, it may be ninety years. I'm not too sure, the<br/>scrolls were badly weathered and my Chinese isn't all that great." I<br/>wasn't even lying. An army of blood-thirsty demons really was going<br/>to be invading. I didn't actually find out from a scroll, but you<br/>can't go around letting people know that the Dark Prince is giving you<br/>hints about the future.<p>"Wouldn't Setsuna have told us about something like that?" Minako<br/>asked. Better and better.<p>Katya answered this one."My younger sister has been a bit short<br/>sighted in a long term way. She has worried far too much about<br/>manipulating the past in order to achieve a goal much farther into the<br/>future than she should have strived for. The strain of that and a few<br/>recent events have been too much for her and I'm sorry to say that<br/>I've had to have her committed to a psychiatric hospital. With<br/>electroshock treatments, the doctors think she'll make a full<br/>recovery, in about a decade." Oh that was smooth, very smooth. Isn't<br/>sisterly love wonderful?<p>"See, if we help take over the world now, we'll be helping to save it<br/>and humanity in the long run. So, who's in?" I wasn't going to give<br/>them too much time to think too carefully about this. We needed to<br/>get to the Amazon village and consolidate our power as quickly as<br/>possible. To top the deal off, I said,"It'd be safer for your parents<br/>too. If they stayed here in Japan while the war is going on, they<br/>would be in lots of danger, from starving people that can't function<br/>without the internet and microwaves, to Jusendo death squads. If<br/>they're in Jusendo where no one but the people on our side can go,<br/>they'd be as safe as anyone can possibly be." Ah ha ha ha, way to go<br/>me.<p>"You say that they're martial artists?" Makoto asked. She had that<br/>look in her eye that sorta says 'I'm determined to get my way and<br/>you'd better not try to stop me'.<p>I nodded."Oh yes, every single person is a martial artist of at least<br/>world class proficiency. Shampoo, she's sorta like the princess of a<br/>tribe of Amazon warriors. They're led by women and a lot of the<br/>advanced martial arts I learned is Amazon in origin." Well, Sailor<br/>Jupiter was sold.<p>"Jusendo is too too beautiful," Shampoo added."Always like spring<br/>time. And womens very respected in tribe, especially sorceresses.<br/>Sorry Shampoo's Japanese so bad," she finished with a grin.<p>I think that one pulled in Minako and Rei, two very strong-willed, if<br/>a bit flightly young women."And there's lots of room for our pokemon<br/>to roam around, too," I added. And Usagi's eyes lit up like<br/>headlights.<p>Ami could read my face and feel my emotions too well for me to even<br/>attempt to manipulate her, not to mention how smart she is. I<br/>probably couldn't really have manipulated her no matter what our<br/>relationship was. So, I just said to her,"This really is for the<br/>best. Your mother being a fully trained doctor would be enough to get<br/>her a seat on the Council of Elders. That's the women in charge." Not<br/>that I intended to let any of them tell me what to do.<p>Katya once again chose to be helpful, saying,"Why don't we let the<br/>girls talk it over amongst themselves and you and I can discuss some<br/>business that we need to take care of?" I nodded and we left the girls<br/>in a tight little group to convince each other that they should join<br/>up. I gathered up Shampoo and Mousse as we headed to the kitchen.<p>"Ranma, we weren't really supposed to pick up anyone but you," Mousse<br/>said, a little overwhelmed by the last few minutes of conversation and<br/>events. I don't think either of the Amazons even noticed that their<br/>war was being stolen right out from under them.<p>I shrugged."Don't worry about it, Mousse. The Council definitely<br/>won't be displeased with you or Shampoo if you come back with not only<br/>me, but a whole squad of sorceresses. Oh, and lots of pokemon." He<br/>looked at me funny and I remembered that no one else even knew what<br/>the creatures were. I guess I'd just gotten so used to them being<br/>around that I forgot that no one else on Earth had any of<br/>them."Pokemon are really powerful animals," I told him."I have one<br/>that's over a hundred meters tall and breathes fire, another that can<br/>cause earthquakes at will and is nearly indestructible, and a dragon<br/>pokemon that I've trained to control the elements of nature. The<br/>girls in there each have there own, none as strong as mine, but they<br/>have more of them. Usagi has hundreds. If we really wanted to, the<br/>senshi and I could conquer the world with just the pokemon we have."<p>Mousse's eyes had glazed over some and a tiny line of drool was<br/>leaking from Shampoo's mouth. For effect, I continued,"Usagi's<br/>pokemon are almost steadily producing eggs, so think, we could have<br/>every Amazon in Jusendo equipped with his or her very own living<br/>weapon." Any objections to bringing the senshi and anyone they wanted<br/>to accompany them went right out the window with that last one. I'm<br/>getting pretty good at this.<p>"There are three other senshi to consider," Katya added."Uranus and<br/>Neptune aren't as powerful as the Inner Senshi are thanks to your<br/>instruction, but they are a force to be reckoned with. Poor Saturn<br/>doesn't have long to live, I fear."<p>Damn, I'd forgotten about those three completely."About Saturn, Katya,<br/>I believe I can stop her health from detereorating further, but she'll<br/>lose most of her power." I'd come up with a way to break the link<br/>between Saturn and Silence before the incident at the mountain had<br/>thrown us through the multiverse. Just got a little side-tracked is<br/>all.<p>The Senshi of Space looked at me in confusion."Every incarnation of<br/>Saturn always dies of a wasting sickness. How could you stop a cycle<br/>that has continued for untold eons?" She didn't sound scornful or<br/>unsure, just suprised and hopeful.<p>"You didn't know that Saturn gains her power from being directly<br/>combined with Silence?" She shook her head dumbly."Silence is a really<br/>powerful Infernal entity that used to go around destroying worlds, a<br/>really, really long time ago. He disappeared, though, and then Sailor<br/>Saturn, the Bringer of Silence appeared shortly thereafter." I had<br/>pieced this all together on a rainy day shortly after learning of the<br/>existance of the Outer Senshi."If I broke the link, she wouldn't be<br/>any stronger than any of the other Outer Senshi, but she wouldn't die,<br/>and as much as I hate to say it, if I had to choose between a year of<br/>absolute power or a couple millenia of some power and a normal life, I<br/>would get rid of absolute power in a heart beat."<p>"Well then, we'll be making a stop, you and I, by young Hotaru's home<br/>after this meeting." Katya's voice brooked no argument.<p>"That's fine with me. We are probably gonna have a bunch of family<br/>members and friends tagging along with us to China, so we should<br/>figure out how to get them there. We could probably use the pokemon,<br/>though it would badly exhaust them, to make the trip, but you have<br/>that nice teleportation spell, and I only need to see it a few more<br/>times before I can do it myself. Feel like being a mystic taxi<br/>service?" I asked. Katya's teleportation spell wasn't just a way to<br/>get around from place to place. If used properly, you could remove<br/>someone's heart before they could blink or just as easily cut someone<br/>in half with a thought and without any evidence that you caused the<br/>death. Very versatile spell.<p>****<p>"I'm free! I'm free!" Ryoga exclaimed in joy. He wasn't wearing<br/>anything but a tiny pair of leather briefs and a rubber hood, but he<br/>was free."Now, Ranma and Genma Saotome, for making my life hell and<br/>leading me into the life of a sex slave, you shall die!"<p>What Ryoga didn't know was that he was standing on the launch platform<br/>for the Wizard of Gates' newest series of orbital laser cannons. This<br/>one even included its very own nuclear ballistic missles. Because of<br/>this added weight, the rocket thrusters on cargo vessel were<br/>exceptionally large.<p>'5..4..3..2..1, and launch is a go!' came the voice over the<br/>Microsoft(once known as Apple Headquarters) Space Center's speaker<br/>system.<p>Ryoga looked around, finally ripping the hood from his head to<br/>increase his periphreal vision. He seemed to notice just how unusual<br/>his surroundings were when he felt an inordinate amount of heat coming<br/>from above. He looked up just as the rocket engines ignited.<p>"I'll get yu for this, Raaannnnmm-" the scream of rage was cut off by<br/>its source being severely overcooked.<p>****<p>Ami, being the closest to me, was chosen to act as emissary. Yeah,<br/>way corny, but their words, not mine."We all agree that fighting with<br/>you and Saffron, with the later intent of supplanting Saffron as ruler<br/>would be the most beneficial for the world in general."I nodded,<br/>grinning at her knowingly. They had all been ready to jump in a boat<br/>and paddle to China before their little meeting."We all want to bring<br/>our families and friends with us, though," she added. All in all, not<br/>a very long list of demands.<p>"Sure, no problem. You'd all better start rounding them up. I<br/>imagine that the friends will want to bring their families also, and<br/>so on and so forth. If you girls want to pull this off, you'd better<br/>get busy. Katya and I need to see about the other senshi." We were<br/>probably going to end up with a few hundred, if not more, useless<br/>people, but those relatively few people were being backed by serious<br/>power. The Council would see that and not bitch or moan too much.<p>After some grumbling at the work ahead of them, the senshi, except for<br/>Ami, all went to do as I had told them. I hope they didn't botch it<br/>and get us all in trouble. My fiance(sounds nice doesn't it?) pulled<br/>me back into the kitchen and asked,"You and that girl, Shampoo, you<br/>two have been together, haven't you?"<p>That came faster than I'd expected."Yeah, but it was years ago, and<br/>I've already made it clear to her that you and me are inseperable.<br/>She understands. You're not jealous, are you?" Of course she was<br/>jealous, I could feel it in her, despite her efforts to bottle the<br/>emotion up.<p>She paused for a few moments and eventually nodded."I can't help it.<br/>She's so beautiful and a powerful warrior like you." She shrugged."I<br/>guess I'm being silly. I know that you wouldn't cheat on me, I can<br/>'feel' it in my bones, but I still worry."<p>I hugged her reassuringly and whispered,"Don't worry, you're the only<br/>one for me. Besides, Shampoo may not know it yet, but she's in love<br/>with Mousse." I'm not sure how long I let the embrace last, but I<br/>missed the warmth of Ami's body pressed against mine when we<br/>separated."You should probably go and break the news to your mom.<br/>Please try to convince her that I'm not evil." I just knew that Ms.<br/>Mizuno was going to blame this on me, even if it was my fault.<p>"I should give her some time to gather any medical supplies she might<br/>need."<p>I wonder how all those adults are going to feel about being railroaded<br/>into such a drastic change of life by their children.<p>****<p>I let Katya ring the door bell at the Ten'ou home. This, apparently,<br/>was where the rug-munching(not that I have anything against this<br/>particular hobby, as long as the muncher and munchee are both in the<br/>mega-attractive category) senshi, with their ward Hotaru, lived.<br/>After a few more buzzez from the bell, the door was opened by a blue-<br/>haired young woman who, from descriptions given by the other senshi, I<br/>recognized as Michiru, a.k.a. Sailor Neptune.<p>She first saw Katya and stepped back in suprise. When she saw me she<br/>reached her arm into another one of those spatial pockets and pulled<br/>out a henshin rod. Damn Setsuna and her crazy, paranoid, dogfucking-<br/>self.<p>Katya reached out and grabbed Michiru's arm."Hold it right there,<br/>young lady. I don't know what my sister has told you about Ranma, but<br/>he's on our side. Setsuna is just slightly bonkers right now and I'm<br/>filling in for her. Won't you invite us in?"<p>Warily, Michiru stepped back, not turning her back to us. Once we<br/>were in the house, I said,"I've come to cure Hotaru. She'll die<br/>without my help." I've been playing hero a lot lately. The feeling of<br/>accomplishment can grow on you after a while.<p>Hearing my claim, the Senshi of Neptune blinked and jumped slightly as<br/>if startled by something. She still didn't look ready to trust me,<br/>though.<p>"Where is the girl?" Katya asked. I have a feeling that she knew<br/>exactly where Hotaru was, but for the life of me I can't figure out<br/>why she asked. I sure could feel the virtual bleeding off of power<br/>from Silence. There was a very faint undertone of another life force<br/>going with that power. Hotaru must be fading extraordinarily fast if<br/>I could feel her life leaving her bodily that easily.<p>Michiru remained silent, but she led us down a wide hallway with some<br/>expensive looking paintings on the walls and up a spiral flight of<br/>stairs. From the top of them we went down a dimly lit hallway to a<br/>room located at the end of the corridor. Quietly, Michiru opened the<br/>door and we walked into an even more dimly lit bedroom. A small, very<br/>frail looking girl with short black hair laid in the bed, sleeping.<br/>Her breathing was irregular and I could feel the uneven flows of<br/>energy throughout her body. Talk about cutting it close.<p>"What are you going to do?" Michiru asked, breaking her silence. She<br/>glanced worriedly at the small figure who was covered up to her neck<br/>in thick blankets."Please don't let her die."<p>For all spells with patterns more complicated than the mind can safely<br/>coordinate, what do we use? That's right, our trusty athame. In a<br/>single motion too fast to be seen by either senshi, I drew the demon<br/>forged blade. Michiru gasped and Katya raised a questioning eyebrow.<br/>"Dont't worry, I'm not going to hurt her. This will help me cast the<br/>spell that will separate her from Silence."<p>Katya walked Michiru over to a small couch set in the corner of the<br/>room and firmly planted the worried woman. I began drawing symbols in<br/>the air, some gold and some silver. All of them contained as much<br/>power as I could concentrate through my crystals without giving any of<br/>the senshi or Hotaru brain damage. As I continued to draw the<br/>extremely complicated spell, forming a net of overlapping words of<br/>power, I began chanting. The chant held no power in itself, this<br/>spell was my own creation and I don't really like binding power into<br/>words for it is too easy to make a costly and dangerous mistake that<br/>way, but the chant allowed my mind to focus sharply enough to finish<br/>the last few passes of the spell. When I had it completely patterned,<br/>there were no distinguishable lines, just a solid mass of gold and<br/>silver energy floating before me. This spell would have absolutely<br/>exhausted me before aquiring my lens crystal, now though, I was only<br/>slightly winded, and that was mostly mental fatigue.<p>A slight tendril of energy connecting Hotaru's soul with the spell was<br/>all that was required to activate it. As the amassed energy, enough<br/>to decimate Tokyo if properly used, hit the girl, she convulsed once<br/>and was still. Michiru screamed in the background. I ignored her,<br/>keeping my attention on my subject and making sure she didn't have an<br/>unforseen reaction.<p>A minute passed, then five, ten, twenty, an hour. Then, when I was<br/>about to give up and cancel the spell, Hotaru convulsed once more, and<br/>from her sweat covered brow, rose a three inch high little amalgam of<br/>insect, mud, and mucus. It floated into the air and was held tightly<br/>in place by the containment portion of my spell.<p>"Release me at once, puny mortal!" Silence roared in a squeak barely<br/>worthy of a mouse. Heh, life hadn't been too good for it lately,<br/>either.<p>"Hey, I'm Ranma. You should really thank me for releasing you from<br/>your prison. I believe you, too, would have died with this latest<br/>Saturn." That was true. From the power I'd felt leaking from the<br/>girl, I'd thought Silence was still going strong, but that obviously<br/>had been the entity's death throws. Thirty thousand years and<br/>numerous reincarnations had not been kind to Silence. Now free, he<br/>was already starting to regain his power. The process would probably<br/>take a few centuries, but I wasn't about to leave a creature like this<br/>around that most likely held grudges and would eventually be able to<br/>destroy the planet I lived on.<p>"Ha! Your primitive mind can't even begin to grasp my power! Release<br/>me or I shall destroy you!" Silence squeaked again. Obnoxious<br/>little bastard. I reached out and thumped it on the forehead. It<br/>squeak/roared again and lashed out with a finger-sized bolt of energy<br/>that fizzled out a foot from my face. That effort left Silence barely<br/>substantial enough to exist.<p>I briefly wondered if I should keep him as a pet. A magically<br/>modified pokeball and a few years of study and I would be able to<br/>control the entity. That's a lot of trouble, though, so I just used<br/>all the energy from my recently completed spell to form a barrier much<br/>like the one I'd used to confine Setsuna when she had attacked me. I<br/>compressed it as much as possible and fed enough raw energy into it to<br/>keep Silence fed for a few years. When I was done there was a snow<br/>globe sized force bubble containing what had once been one of the<br/>deadliest beings in existance. I attached a kind of mystic note to<br/>the sphere and chunked it through a small tear in reality that led<br/>directly to Hell. Nicky would get a kick out of the little guy.<p>Teary-eyed, Michiru and Katya approached me at Hotaru's bedside. The<br/>little girl's complextion had already improved and I could sense that<br/>her body, as tired and worn out as it was, would make a full recovery<br/>in time."I have the skill to fix actual injuries and cure diseases,<br/>but Usagi is the only person I know with enough skill in white magic<br/>to speed up the recovery process from something like this. We can<br/>bring her by tomorrow."<p>Michiru nodded, looked at the floor, then rushed me. She gave me a<br/>crushing hug of gratitude and got my shirt all wet with tears."Thank<br/>you, oh thank you!" she cried softly. I'm not one for great big<br/>emotional scenes, Kamis know that I have enough trouble dealing with<br/>Ami, so I just nodded and tried out my new teleportation spell for the<br/>first time. The hole in space deposited me in my bathtub instead of<br/>my living room. Pretty good for a first try.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I managed to get this whole<br/>chapter done in a little more than two hours! BWAHAHAHAHAHA! I'm<br/>proud of myself. Anyway, this was supposed to be posted in the morning,<br/>also being the last chapter until thursday night at the earliest. That<br/>changed when I came down stairs this morning and it was raining outside.<br/>Now that my truck has been taken away from me by my bastard father, my<br/>mother(a.k.a. supreme high super bitch) was going to drive me to my grandma's.<br/>Well, she didn't want to get out in the rain, so I'll be stuck here. She's<br/>made me drive to the store when there was a tropical storm floating over<br/>the entire state and she couldn't drive me forty miles to see my old, most<br/>likely not going to live for too many more years grandmother. It'll come<br/>back on her one day, though, when I put her in the dirtiest, most disrepu-<br/>table nursing home I can find(the kind that doesn't turn the old person<br/>over but once every six months). I'm sure that no one really wants to hear<br/>about my fucked up family, so I'll just drop the matter. All the<br/>suggestions I get now, with the story in its present state, will help me<br/>a bunch. Like always, send C&amp;C to<br/>dark_<p>
