</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 1<p>"Why did she make us meet here?" Usagi whined. She was still dressed<br/>in her pajamas and had static electricity crackling through her<br/>unbrushed and unmeatballed hair. The other girls, with the exception<br/>of Ami, were looking equally bedraggled. They hadn't stopped<br/>searching for the new agent of evil until well after sunrise. That<br/>had been three hours ago.<p>Rei, baggy eyed and more ornery than ever, looked at her semi-friend<br/>flatly and said,"This is Setsuna, she wouldn't tell us if the end of<br/>the world was three minutes away. It probably has something to do<br/>with that guy, though."<p>Makoto sighed wistfully."I really wish he wasn't some sort of horrible<br/>demon/monster thing in a human suit, because he was a major babe." She<br/>blushed at the memory of the compliment he had paid her.<p>"Oh shut up," someone snapped from behind them. They all turned with<br/>varying degrees of sluggishness to see the new arrival. She was<br/>short, red-haired, and made all the girls except for one who will<br/>remain nameless(she blushed instead) nearly insane with jealousy."So<br/>that's Pluto's name, eh? Setsuna. Anyone know her last name?"<p>****<p>I was not in a good mood. Three dozen pigeons could attest to that,<br/>if they weren't piles of ash and feathers now. And that bus really<br/>shouldn't have gotten in my way.<p>"Who are you?" black hair and baggy eyed asked in an 'Oh please give<br/>me a reason to kill you' voice.<p>I might not be able to get to Setsuna, but there were plenty of<br/>targets around here for a little petty vengeance."I'm the retard that<br/>Setsuna tricked into trying to teach you girls how to use your powers.<br/>You all are the sailor senshi, right?" There was a very strong<br/>resembalance between these girls and the senshi from the night before.<br/>At least they could do a passable glamore spell on their own, at least<br/>one strong enough to mislead me. My life would have been a good deal<br/>easier if I had ever been able to do more than make a pimple<br/>disappear.<p>"What?" the same girl continued.<p>"Okay, I'll go slowly so no one misunderstands the words that are<br/>coming out of my mouth. I am named Ranma. I use magic. I like to<br/>blow stuff up and kill people that piss me off. I got suckered into<br/>teaching you all how to do your job." I formed a globe of prizmatic<br/>light in my left hand and tossed it into the air. It exploded into<br/>hundreds of motes of light that blossomed into flowers wherever they<br/>struck the ground. A simple illusion that faded quickly, but it<br/>served to get the point across.<p>"Wow, that was so pretty!" tall, blonde, and 'blonde' exclaimed."Are<br/>you a new senshi? What's your planet? Do you have a cat like Luna or<br/>Artemis? What color is your skirt?" And the deluge continued for all<br/>of three minutes without a single break to breathe.<p>I noticed that the other girls were all giving the air head looks of<br/>disgust at least as malevolent as mine. Goodie, dissention within the<br/>ranks.<p>"No, I would kill myself before I let myself be caught dead in one of<br/>those things you call an outfit," I said, finally managing to break<br/>the torrent of neverending questions."I am going to teach you girls<br/>magic. Does anyone not understand that?"<p>Lo and behold, the girl of a million questions raised her hand."Do you<br/>mean we're going to learn to pull rabbits out of hats and stuff?"<p>I looked at a girl with short blue/black hair. The spark of an<br/>unusual intelligence burnt within her dark eyes. Wonderful. At least<br/>one with more brains than a turnip."Could you explain to her that I am<br/>supposed to teach you magic? You know, wrath of the kami kind of<br/>stuff."<p>Non-stupid was explaining while I was being eyeballed suspisciously by<br/>three other girls. To break the uneasy silence I asked,"About the<br/>skirts, do you where those by choice or are they some kind of required<br/>senshi uniform thing?"<p>They all had the slightly shell shocked expression of someone who just<br/>found out that they're gay. Finally the tall brown-haired girl<br/>answered,"They come with the transformation."<p>"Transformation?" Great. Now they spring something like a magical<br/>transformation on me. Setsuna was really racking up uncool points.<p>Long black hair elbowed tall brown hair and she remained silent."Look,<br/>I don't have a choice in the matter. I made a blood pact with Sailor<br/>Pluto. You know who I'm talking about? Tall, has green hair, and<br/>really needs her ass kicked."<p>"Well, that is true," muttered long black hair.<p>Before I could get any more info, the smart one called,"I think she<br/>understands now." And it only took five minutes.<p>I pointed to tall brown hair and said,"She just mentioned a<br/>transformation. Would someone like to explain that a little better?"<p>"I can do that." Ah, Setsuna was actually stupid enough to show up. I<br/>may not be able to hurt her, but boils and oozing sores don't really<br/>count. No wait, the forces surrounding the image were skewed. It was<br/>just an illusion. Damn, guess I'll have to settle for the gentler<br/>curses.<p>"That was a real nasty trick you played on me, Setsuna," I<br/>commented."One day you'll regret it."<p>Setsuna just nodded and introduced me to each of the girls. With<br/>names to put to the faces the glamores were completely broken and I<br/>could easily place them from the night before."The transformation is a<br/>short cut method that allows the senshi to access their power and<br/>provides them with certain spell templates that require no actual<br/>casting to invoke. The transformation automatically includes a<br/>glamore and magical body armor."<p>I nodded as she explained. The practice wasn't unheard of, at least<br/>it wasn't in the time when most of my more potent tomes of arcane<br/>knowledge were written. I'd never read of such an overall effect<br/>though. Magical body armor? Heh, heh heheheh. My full blown<br/>laughter stopped Setsuna from continuing."Those little pieces of<br/>ribbon and spandex are magical body armor?"<p>"I'll have you know that during the Silver Millenium that style was<br/>highly fashionable," Setsuna retorted tartly.<p>Sigh."What effect does the stuff have besides being every fifteen year<br/>old's wet dream?"<p>"Lessens physical and mystical blows and quadruples overall physical<br/>abilities." This time Ami answered. She had definite potential, both<br/>in power and the full range of mental faculties needed to grasp the<br/>more difficult points of advanced sorcery.<p>Hmm, maybe I could alter that part of the transformation spell to give<br/>them some decent armor, maybe an actual weapon besides that ridiculous<br/>sceptre of Usagi's."Well then. That's all I need to know I guess.<br/>You can run along now, Setsuna. I expect you'll be needing to hop on<br/>the toilet in about..."I looked at my watch,"six seconds." Six seconds<br/>passed in silence then the illusion of Sailor Pluto abruptly vanished.<p>"What did you do to her?" Minako gasped.<p>"Explosive diarhhea." I grinned evilly. The girls all sported looks<br/>of shocked horror."If you knew what she did to me then you wouldn't<br/>think I'm such a horrible person."<p>I was ignored for a few minutes while a spontaneous debate on what<br/>punishment Setsuna deserved for sticking them with a psychopath like<br/>me. They could at least have the good sense to call me sociopath like<br/>I deserve. I'm not really crazy, really, but I have an image to<br/>maintain.<p>"Enough of this crap. We have all day to work on deciding what to<br/>teach to whom and I don't plan on wasting it. Get those pen things<br/>that you use to become senshi out and hand them over." They were all<br/>reluctant, especially Rei, but my hard, glowing-eyed stare diffused<br/>that situation. I have to give whoever made these things some credit.<br/>No one would ever think that they were powerful magical tools, novelty<br/>vibrators yes, but never what they truly were.<p>"Well, here goes nothing," I said, making sure that I had all four<br/>pens and a locket firmly grasped in my right hand. A flash of green<br/>light and a screeching/crunching sound were the only visible effects<br/>generated by the destruction of the henshin rods.<p>I expected gasps and maybe a few screams, but not Rei lunging for my<br/>throat with claws extended. Despite my suprise, I was easily able to<br/>erect a barrier capable of holding off a completely ignorant,<br/>nonmagically enhanced mortal. This girl has some serious anger<br/>control issues.<p>"Calm down, damnit. I had to do that. It released your magic into<br/>you without leaving behind a conduit for it to be stolen or controlled<br/>by someone else." Geeze, this was going to be a long decade.<p>I wasted the next hour determining that each girl had an extreme<br/>elemental affinity that was so ingrained that almost all other magic<br/>was beyond their ability to use. Not my fault. They would all be<br/>extremely good at what they could do, though. Usagi was going to be a<br/>problem. Not just because my left shoe was more intelligent than her,<br/>but because as her control over her true powers grew, her control over<br/>that giant energy crystal she wore as a broach would lessen. She<br/>probably would have been more effective if Setsuna had just excluded<br/>her. I guess I shouldn't complain, I do afterall have all intentions<br/>of taking that crystal with me when I finish this job. None of the<br/>senshi will be able to use it anyway and they don't have to turn into<br/>a freaking girl so they won't be hunted 24/7. Yes, with that crystal<br/>world domination may not be too far over the horizon.<p>"Finally, we can get to the actual learning. This is a very weak<br/>spell that is useless as anything but a magical flashlight. It may<br/>not even be that good if you generate a dark color." I drew my athame<br/>and made a few quick passes in the air, leaving ribbons of white and<br/>green light."Stare at the patterns until your eyes water so badly that<br/>you can't see anymore. When you've done that do it again and again<br/>until you understand how to do what the instructions say." Sure, this<br/>is the hard way, but I'll be damned if I'm going to make it easy on<br/>them. It would take just as long either way, and this method makes it<br/>easier to learn the more complex stuff.<p>No one even questioned me. I spent half an hour focusing the<br/>spiritual energy that permeated this shrine through my athame and<br/>using it to rework the spells that I had absorbed from the henshin<br/>rods. No exertion at all on my part and I had changed the Sailor<br/>Senshi from sex objects into armorclad and nicely armed devil hunters.<br/>I'd let them activate the spell themselves sometime later and see how<br/>they liked it. I had barely finished when Ami beckoned me over to<br/>her.<p>A fist sized sphere of soft blue light was slowly orbiting her head.<br/>She was a fast learner. She was even making it move."Nice work. It's<br/>good to know that someone here actually deserves the power they were<br/>gifted with," I sighed.<p>"This is what the spell is supposed to make, sensei?" she asked shyly.<p>I nodded and said,"Yep. You caught on quickly. No other spell is<br/>even a fraction as easy to learn as this one, but at this rate you may<br/>get another weak illusion finished today."<p>Ami beamed at my praise. I was about to go check on the progress of<br/>the others when she shyly said,"Ranma-sensei, I know that you're not<br/>very happy to be teaching us, and that you were tricked into it, but<br/>could you try to be patient with us? Especially Usagi. She isn't as<br/>...dumb as she looks or acts. We've all been through a lot together<br/>and she's never let us down."<p>I nodded without comment. It wouldn't do to upset my only promising<br/>student. I decided that maybe it wouldn't hurt to be a 'little' nicer<br/>to the girls, but Usagi, in my opinion, was still dumber than my shoe.<br/>Rei was the next to successfully cast the spell. Not suprising now<br/>that I knew she had some pretty extensive spiritual training. Her<br/>natural auraul color was blood red. I was starting to notice a<br/>pattern with this whole color scheme. Next came Makoto with deep<br/>green followed by Minako with warm yellow, and finally Usagi with<br/>virgin white.<p>"It's pretty late, at least too late for you to learn another spell."<br/>That wasn't entirely true. Ami had managed to learn the flower trick,<br/>but she was vastly outgunning her friends with her learning curve.<br/>Setsuna probably wanted the purely offensive and defensive to be the<br/>main focus. Good, as soon as she got of the toilet she could look<br/>back and see me spending weeks on useless crap. Of course if she<br/>understood more than her temporal magic she could easily know that<br/>there wasn't much other way to teach the senshi.<p>Before I made my escape I asked,"Do any of you have any actual combat<br/>training?" I wasn't hoping for much, but sometimes even I can be<br/>suprised. Why was I going to teach the senshi how to fight? Beats<br/>me. I guess I like to do a good job, even if I was tricked into it.<p>"I know how to do this really neat super kick thingy that helped beat<br/>a youma a long time ago." I ignored Usagi's babbling and waited for<br/>anymore responses.<p>"I have my first dan in kempo," Makoto volunteered. Hallelujeuh!<p>"I'm a black belt in karate," Rei answered. Praise Bill Gates!<p>See, never have any hope and anything short of death is a pleasant<br/>suprise."Good. Tomorrow we start the physical side of your<br/>education." I didn't give them time to ask any questions. I sunk into<br/>the shadows and rose beside a trash can in the park across the street.<br/>All in all not too bad of a day. Setsuna should be noticing the<br/>mutant lice any time now.<p>****<p>Far off in space in the really darks part where evil tended to<br/>spontaneously appear for no reason but to give super hero types<br/>anxiety attacks nothing was happening and all was right with the<br/>galaxy.<p>****<p>Deep under miles of ocean, nothing was stirring, not even a giant<br/>squid, much less a force for evil.<p>****<p>Several abandoned fortresses and castles from the time of the Silver<br/>Millenium remained abandoned.<p>****<p>Thanks to an industrious American named Quinn Malory there were no<br/>unusual dimensional invaders eying our own little piece of semi-<br/>quantum stability. They were all too busy fighting off a prolific<br/>race of eyeball eating things with an unreasoning hatred of humans<br/>that young Quinn was inadvertently leading on a grand tour of the<br/>known multiverse.<p>****<p>And besides a small city in southern California with an extremely high<br/>vampire to human ratio, there was very little active involvement with<br/>the forces of hell.<p>****<p>So, why was Setsuna getting the Inner Senshi a classical sorcerous<br/>education?<p>****<p>Ranma didn't care for the whole safety of the world, cosmic balance<br/>between good and evil crap. He figured if things ever got bad enough<br/>where life on Earth was threatened, he could just call up a gateway to<br/>an alternate earth or maybe try to break into heaven. Everyone has to<br/>have a hobby.<p>Disgustedly, Ranma threw down the tv remote and stalked into the<br/>kitchen. He would never have guessed that unlimited access to as much<br/>free porn as he could stand would take all the fun out of actually<br/>watching it. Damnit, Setsuna was just asking for a viscious case of<br/>crabs.<p>****<p>Across Tokyo in a suprisingly large house for such a crowded area, one<br/>Soun Tendo, emotional wreck extraordanaire, was rereading his mail.<p>Tendo, bringing Ranma from China<p>Saotome,<p>"Oh happy day! Girls! Kasumi, Nabiki, Akane! Come here! Your<br/>father has an announcement to make!<p>****<p>"I said no and I mean no!" Ryoga shouted in fury."I would rather die<br/>than pretend that I was Ranma! Do you hear me? I would rather DIE!<br/>Do you have any idea what he would do to me if he found out I was<br/>impersonating him again?"<p>"What could be worse than turning into a pig when you get splashed<br/>with cold water?" Genma asked dumbly. He had to do something or the<br/>schools would never be joined. If they could get rid of the boy's<br/>directional curse and have those fangs ground down, Nodoka may even be<br/>fooled.<p>"I don't know," Ryoga said calmly before exploding,"Maybe being a pig<br/>all the time!"<p>The boy had a point."What if I taught you secret techniques so<br/>dangerous that I sealed them away years ago? Techniques powerful<br/>enough to defeat even my misguided son."<p>Ryoga lowered the umbrella that was about to crush Genma's skull and<br/>asked,"What techniques? Magic?" He shuddered at the thought of using<br/>something as horrible as magic.<p>"No, you dolt! Martial arts techniques, not that magic crap. The<br/>Umi-senken and Yama-senken are powerful beyond belief and can only be<br/>truly mastered by someone both strong of body and mind." Genma looked<br/>at Ryoga doubtfully as he spoke the 'mind' part. There really wasn't<br/>much choice though.<p>"And all I have to do is pretend that I'm Ranma and you'll teach me<br/>how to defeat the real Ranma?" There had to be more to the deal.<p>Genma forced a laugh."Well of course you'll have to marry one of<br/>Tendo's daughters. I hear that they're all more than nice to look at,<br/>especially the oldest."<p>The mention of marriage led Ryoga's small mind straight to what<br/>married people are supposed to do. Before he could even respond, a<br/>fountain of blood erupted from his nose and he passed out.<p>The boy would do for now. Genma hoisted Ryoga onto his shoulder and<br/>started jogging toward the coast of China.<p>****<p>Across the pacific ocean, Bill Gates, the only man richer than the All<br/>Mighty, chuckled darkly as the latest version of Windows was shipped<br/>out. Try to take away his monopoly would they? Try to split his<br/>company into mere shards of its greater whole? Ha, they would all<br/>pay, and their little dog too.<p>****<p>"I still don't think we can trust her," Rei said. She was tossing her<br/>sphere of light from one hand to antoher.<p>"She finally managed to get Setsuna," Minako commented."That makes her<br/>ok in my bag." She didn't notice the stares her comment recieved.<p>"Setsuna wouldn't have gotten her to teach us if she wasn't<br/>trustworthy," Makoto added.<p>"And look what she got for her troubles," Rei retorted.<p>"But from what she says, Setsuna did something pretty bad to her. She<br/>seems nice enough to me even if she is a little rough around the edges<br/>and way to masculine for someone so pretty." Thankfully no one took<br/>notice of the last part of the remark from the nameless senshi.(Oh<br/>come on, it isn't like this is supposed to be hard to figure out)<p>"Okay then, what happens if we need to fight a demon, or rescue people<br/>from a burning building or something?" Rei sounded desperate to find<br/>some unexplicable fault with Ranma.<p>"That is pretty important. I'm sure that she'll tell us about that<br/>today," Ami said.<p>Usagi was too busy showing Luna her own light sphere to contribute<br/>anything meaningful to the conversation.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: I hope to god that my writer's block has finally<br/>chosen another helpless victim to torment. Maybe it has, but I'm<br/>guessing that it's probably just on vacation. Send C&amp;C to<br/>dark_ please.<p>
