</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 10<p>I knew the senshi and I kept ending up in forests evertime we jumped<br/>dimensions because I had searched for Earth and those planes most<br/>similar to it had most of the same features. That knowledge didn't<br/>stop me from hoping that this world would have something besides<br/>forest for a thousand miles in all directions. I mean, a city could<br/>be built in this dimension and not in the others.<p>No such luck. If anything, the sparse forest seemed larger than the<br/>others. Without magic for flight, we were in for a long, long<br/>journey. The pokemon didn't mind giving us rides, and Kamis know that<br/>Usagi had enough pokemon to carry a mountain with us, but even with<br/>that advantage, it was slow going. If only the flying pokemon were<br/>larger, they would have been suitable transportation. Without a<br/>designated place to land, though, a flying pokemon couldn't use its<br/>extraordinary ability to travel at supersonic speeds and would tire<br/>quickly when carrying a load. Demon could have flown us all if his<br/>wing structure had allowed for places for us and the gear.<p>Gyrados, dragon snake thing that it was, didn't ever actually touch<br/>the ground, sorta hovering a few inches in the air. I, at least, was<br/>riding in style. Poor Rei couldn't ride her rat, despite its huge<br/>size. She'd had to borrow one of Usagi's, a Rhydon.<p>"I should be able to do this," Rei said, irritated that she couldn't<br/>master the breathing techniques I had been teaching."All those years<br/>as a temple maiden, learning to manipulate the sacred flame, and I<br/>can't so much as get a spark." She adjusted her seat on the Rhydon.<br/>The poorly woven mass of straw didn't do a good job of protecting<br/>Rei's soft skin from the Rhydon's rock hard hide. Her stubborn pride<br/>wouldn't allow her to accept a different pokemon as conveyance.<p>I sighed and tried to explain."I told you it could take years to<br/>learn." Ha, I learned in three weeks! What can I say, I'm gifted."And<br/>stop trying to manifest the chi. All I want you to do is learn to<br/>evenly space and control the depth of each breath you take." Harder to<br/>accomplish than one may think.<p>Later that day, the forest ended entirely, opening into a plain<br/>covered in waist high grass for as far as the eye could see. This was<br/>getting ridiculous. Even on Ranma World, a planet abandoned for<br/>untold centuries, there had been a dirt road. That still bothers me<br/>occassionally. A plain dirt road would have been overgrown within<br/>months of disuse. Ranma World was strange. I'll just have to accept<br/>that.<p>"It'd be stupid to go back and waste a week's worth of time," I said,<br/>as leader(how that happened is as big a mystery as the dirt road).<br/>Part of it involved being more experienced and knowledgable, only a<br/>part though.<p>"I agree," agreed Ami."At the very least we should journey far enough<br/>onto the plain to determine whether or not there is enough wild game<br/>and fresh water to support us and our pokemon." The suggestion was<br/>perfectly reasonable and we didn't argue with its logic.<p>"To the grass!" Usagi declared, waving her arm wildly through the air<br/>from the back of her Dandelion. I think she believed there to be a<br/>possibility of wild pokemon in the grass. Makoto brought it up,<br/>though.<p>"Well, there could be," Usagi muttered. Hell, there really could be.<br/>No way would I admit to that slim chance, not if I wanted to stay sane<br/>through the rest of the trip.<p>****<p>Times like this made Setsuna wish she wasn't so cronically cryptic and<br/>mysterious. Her future self had to know what had happened to the<br/>senshi. With rules as concrete as the ones she lived by, Setsuna<br/>didn't even think about asking.<p>Viewing the senshi's pasts up until their disappearance took almost as<br/>much time as if she had jumped back and watched each scene unfold.<br/>She was pleased to see how much the girls had improved and couldn't<br/>even find anything to complain about in the changes made to their<br/>transformation spell by Ranma. The kidnapping of Usagi by government<br/>agents came as a shock, even to Setsuna, but Ranma, leading the<br/>remaining Inner Senshi, had freed the Princess, in the process<br/>releasing dozens of dangerous demons and Nerimians(a sub-species of<br/>human nearly as bad). Ranma's doing, and without doubt premeditated.<p>As she watched the last few weeks before the senshi's disappearance,<br/>the puzzle began to come together. Ranma was slowly, with admirable<br/>patience, subverting the girls. His discovery of Usagi's mind block<br/>was too coincidental to be a coincidence.<p>When the government contacted the senshi and Ranma, Setsuna debated<br/>whether or not she should begin reviewing the past of the Emperor and<br/>his men, but ruled it out due to a lack of time(yes, she was actually<br/>running out of time). The big break came when Ranma's services were<br/>requested by his conspirators in the closing of a ruptured tomb<br/>belonging to a long dead warlock who had died in personal battle<br/>against Queen Serenity a century before the fall of the Moon Kingdom.<p>Setsuna was truly frightened for the first time in centuries. Ranma<br/>was involved in too many random occurences and coincidences pertaining<br/>to the senshi and the Silver Millenium. Why had she ever trusted him?<br/>The answer was even more frightening. She, the manipulator, had,<br/>herself, been maniuplated. So subtle had the manipulation been, that<br/>even her temporally honed senses hadn't detected the outside<br/>influence.<p>Who could Ranma's backer be? Another Dark Intelligence like Metallia?<br/>Enemies from the future? The possibilites were too numerous to count.<br/>She really had her work cut out for her.<p>(note: I always have thought of Pluto as something of a manipulative<br/>bitch with way too much time on her hands, literally.)<p>****<p>It's pretty easy to get tired of grass, especially when there's<br/>nothing 'but' grass. That's why I was damned excited when Demon and<br/>I, flying ahead to scout for a water hole, found a river. It wasn't a<br/>meager little stream either. The wide expanse of water moved at a<br/>smooth, if slow pace. This was more than just a break in the scenery.<br/>Town and cities are built on rivers. They make natural shipping<br/>routes. Following the river would be our best bet at finding other<br/>people.<p>Demon made good time back to the senshi and I informed them of my<br/>discovery.<p>"Biiig Waagguuuurrr," Demon said, reinforcing my claim. The pokemon<br/>was learning to speak at an amazing rate. The shape of his jaw,<br/>combined with his unusual teeth and tri-forked tongue, made<br/>pronounciation difficult, but not impossible for the pokemon.<p>"What are we going to build a boat with?" Minako asked. I goggled at<br/>her. That sounded like an Usagi question, a predivine mind block<br/>removal question.<p>Usagi answering and making fun of the other blonde was scary."Minako,<br/>why would we need boats? We have plenty of water pokemon. We'll make<br/>great time on them.<p>Minako blushed deeply and said,"Oh yeah." Twilight zone moment.<p>****<p>A river can get as boring as grass after a while. This one was<br/>working itself up to that when, at the edge of the horizon, the river<br/>began to widen dramatically, either forming a lake or emptying into a<br/>river. It wasn't this change in the natural scenary that got the<br/>attention of the senshi and I. The really, really big city floating<br/>in the air above the lake/bay did. I left Gyrados with a command to<br/>remain in his current position, and pulled Demon out of the hat. I<br/>wasn't the only one to take flight, via pokemon. Usagi on her Zapdos,<br/>Ami on Scyther, and Minako and Makoto on the latter's Aerodactyl, all<br/>formed a V wing formation behind me. Rei must not have cared to leave<br/>her Slowbro, that or she didn't want to borrow another pokemon. She<br/>really should have taken the trouble to catch a few besides the rat.<br/>Useful creatures pokemon, make cats looked damned pathetic.<p>That thing 'was' a city and not some vast mirage. At first I thought<br/>that the city was a giant airship of somekind, a product of advanced<br/>technology, but as the buildings came into sight, I couldn't believe<br/>that a society with the ability to make a floating city would settle<br/>for thatched roofs on the makority of the dwellings and wood fires for<br/>cooking and heat. It was a moment after that little deduction that I<br/>switched my perceptions over to energy patterns, almost giving myself<br/>a mystic whiplash with the violence and speed of the change.<p>Ah. Son of a bitch! All over the city, within large marble buildings<br/>with a disturbing similarity to the ancient temples of Rome and<br/>Greece, were vast arrays of spell constructs. They were so large and<br/>crafted with such skill that they were capable of levitating a city<br/>the size of Tokyo and all its surrounding suburbs. The fact that they<br/>somehow had a complete monopoly on all the energy available for<br/>sorcery on this whole freakin planet didn't escape my notice.<p>I raised my arm and swung it around in a circle, a predetermined<br/>signal that meant to get back to safety. It probably scared the<br/>senshi more than was necessary, but people in that city were most<br/>likely armed with some nasty magical weapons, and the last thing I<br/>needed was to have to save them from getting blasted into ash if one<br/>of the locals saw us and got nervous.<p>"It's in there, ladies." Blank stares, even from Ami. I really<br/>shouldn't have expected much more than that. None of the girls were<br/>far enough along to see what I had."I meant the cause for our loss of<br/>energy. The energy required to levitate that much mass is vast, and<br/>whoever built it decided to make the whole world their battery."<p>"Maybe we could ask them to land for a few minutes and let us<br/>recharge," suggested Usagi.<p>"Na uh, very, very doubtful. From what I can see, the place isn't<br/>built to be landed. The spells active in the consturcts holding the<br/>city afloat aren't the kind that can be turned off on a whim either.<br/>Land it and the city breaks into a lot of little pieces. Cut the<br/>constructs off for even a moment and wham, really big splash." The<br/>obvious answer was to destroy the city and, with the more powerful<br/>pokemon as precision artillery, it could be done. Not that Usagi<br/>would ever let her pokemon be resonsible for such an atrocity.<p>"Don't even mention it Ranma," asserted Ami, to my suprise."We've all<br/>just had the same thought and none of us would do that." I've heard<br/>about sorcerous lovers, those actually in love and who have lived<br/>together for a long time, being able to read their mates thoughts.<br/>That Ami was doing this to me, that was as disturbing as finding out<br/>that I was relatively powerless here.<p>No, what was 'really' disturbing was that I could do the same thing<br/>with her, now that I thought about it. In fact, Ami was silently<br/>congratulating herself on taking such a bold stand with me. Before I<br/>could let myself even think about the implications of the next couple<br/>of thoughts about to appear in my brain, I said,"Sorta figured that.<br/>What else can we do, though? How else do we get the energy we need to<br/>go home?"<p>Ami shrugged."There has to be someone that maintains the constructs<br/>you mentioned. They would surely know of a way to siphon energy from<br/>them without damaging their integrity." She had a point."All that<br/>energy would be too valuable to allow to remain in stasis."<p>I nodded."That is a possibility. Another possiblity is that there is<br/>a magical cannon that shoots nuclear fireballs up on those walls<br/>somewhere and the person operating it may be instructed to vaporize<br/>anything that moves." Extremely unlikely possibility, but still<br/>possible.<p>I turned my attention to a crashing splash of water and saw Demon and<br/>Gyrados playing water volleyball with Slowbro. Who had taught them<br/>that? Why in hell were they playing water volleyball? I shook my<br/>head, telling myself that we had more important fish to fry. No pun<br/>intended.<p>"Hey, leave him along, you big meanies!" cried Usagi as she ran away<br/>from the little meeting, pulling out Dandelion and a pair of<br/>Dragonites that I didn't know by name. As if there wasn't enough crap<br/>to deal with. I pulled Demon and Gyrados' pokeballs from my pocket<br/>and activated the retrieval beam on each. The crimson beams of energy<br/>reached my pokemon and dematerialized them just as a Usagi's trio<br/>reached attack range.<p>Usagi attempted to glare a hole through my head as she walked stiffly<br/>away from the river bank.<p>I waved my arms helplessly."You can't blame them for having a little<br/>fun. Your pokemon didn't seem to mind," I said calmly, trying not to<br/>laugh.<p>"He was probably too scared to move. Next time you better tell those<br/>brutes of your's that I won't go so easy on them!" the meatball headed<br/>warrior for love, justice, and the pokemon way, loudly proclaimed.<p>"Don't worry, I'm sure they'll do their best to avoid your wrath." I<br/>said it with such sincerity that she had to know I was blowing smoke<br/>out of my ass. She just glared at me, absentmindedly stroking the<br/>pokemon stored at her waste belt.<p>"And back to the matter at hand..." Rei said angrily. Can't blame her<br/>for that one.<p>"I have an idea that could solve the safety issue." Guess who. Yes,<br/>you're absolutely correct. It's Ami! You win a tootsie roll!"One of<br/>us will simply fly within range of the city, carrying a pokemon<br/>capable of teleportation, and use it to escape if the need arises."<br/>Good plan.<p>"So which one of you wants-" They were all staring at me. I knew what<br/>that look meant."That's not fair! Demon is way too big to be<br/>teleported by any of your pipsqueaks!" They didn't stop staring. I<br/>could have refused, I guess, but the combined stare of five determined<br/>girls, one of whom you may have growing feelings for, is kinda<br/>overwhelming."Damnit, you all owe me one."<p>Ami winked at me and her grin was positively wanton. What had I made<br/>this sweet, innocent girl into? Hell if I cared.<p>The other girls either didn't see the exchange or chose to ignore it.<br/>Thankfully.<p>****<p>Wouldn't you know that Zapdos, Usagi's thunder bird, was also capable<br/>of teleportation. Why a creature capable of flight would develop such<br/>a skill is beyond me. I mean, it's not like the thing had any natural<br/>predators. At least this way I didn't have to put up with Makoto's<br/>Alakazam. That thing was wierd. What purpose did having two inverted<br/>spoon shaped fingers serve, anyway.<p>"Okay, Sparky, let's see if anyone feels like killing us today." The<br/>peal of thunder, Zapdos' version of a chirp, didn't indicate that the<br/>bird cared very much for its new nickname."Don't get touchy. It was<br/>meant as a compliment."<p>Despite it's attitude, Zapdos loyally followed my orders. We got<br/>close enough to the city for me to brush the crenelated upper wall and<br/>to wave to a bored looking guard wearing stiffened leather armor who<br/>lazily carried a crossbow over his left shoulder. The guy might very<br/>well have pissed his pants, so great was the fear on his face.<p>I was also able to get a better view of the city's internal order. It<br/>was a nice, clean place, especially by the medieval standards it<br/>appeared to be built around. People who saw me on the glowing bird<br/>dropped what they were carrying and ran around screaming in abject<br/>terror. Compared to these people, the guard had been enormously<br/>brave. Wusses.<p>Most important of all, beyond even laughing until my chest hurt, was<br/>the discovery that there were no items with any mystical charge<br/>whatsoever. The constructs holding the city up were it. Good news.<p>****<p>"They ran like I was Barney himself," I reported back to the senshi.<p>"Uh, who's Barney?" Minako asked in confusion.<p>Oops."An American creation. You wouldn't understand. I should have<br/>said Death or Destruction, those would have made more sense to you,<br/>sorry. Anyway, we should be safe. They don't have anything more<br/>advanced than a crossbow, weaponwise, and their fighting ability isn't<br/>even worth mentioning." I hadn't actually seen them fight, but when<br/>the whole general populace, even the guys, runs screaming from you and<br/>a measly bird a tenth the size of Demon...<p>"Poor Zapdos, did he hurt you?" Usagi asked her pokemon. We ignored<br/>her.<p>"Crossbows aren't really such a minor threat when you consider that<br/>all of us are defenseless except for you. Pokemon can't keep us safe<br/>from the bolts without risking themselves. I wouldn't even ask any of<br/>my pokemon to do that." Ami was turning out to be an annoying voice of<br/>reason. Almost as if she were my conscience. I fought down the urge<br/>to cry. What had I done to deserve this?<p>Trying to salvage my good mood, I said,"Don't worry about that. I can<br/>keep anything slower than a high power slug from getting near any of<br/>you. Not that anyone up there has the balls to shoot at us."<p>"Oh please," Rei scoffed."Don't try to convince me that you can move<br/>'that' fast!"<p>To demonstrate my speed, I mooned Rei for a second, flipped her off<br/>for a second, and mooned her again, for a second. This only took me<br/>four seconds. Rei was nearing the purple range of color. Probably<br/>from rage, but I here from reliable sources that my ass is pretty<br/>nice, so it could have just been her feminine modesty...Doubt it<br/>though.<p>"Okay, maybe you are that fast," Minako said, blushing. Ami did not<br/>look happy. Have I ever mentioned that my life sucks ass?<p>"Having along a couple big, evil looking pokemon wouldn't hurt<br/>either." If only we had had enough rock pokemon we could have just<br/>made a living wall, but we didn't, and besides, they're not really all<br/>that fast."Demon and Gyrados are good choices. Any others?"<p>Usagi launched into a recital of at least fifty pokemon she thought<br/>were scary. Once again, she was ignored.<p>****<p>Since there was no visible gate, ramp, or any other conceivable<br/>entrance to the city, we just flew up to the side and glided to the<br/>street nearest what I assumed was the headquarters. The streets here<br/>were easily wide enough to accomodate Demon once the pedestrians had<br/>run away. As predicted, they screamed like maniacs as they departed.<p>"So, should we just walk up the steps and knock on the door?" I asked.<br/>The building we stood in front of was large and overly decorated. It<br/>could have been someone's house, but the statues of people in robes<br/>with books and other stuff in their grasp indicated otherwise. The<br/>gold-veined marble that the building was constructed from did look<br/>pretty cool, though.<p>"Why not?" Minako asked. She was the last one to put her pokemon<br/>away.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: So far this story has been recieved much better than<br/>I thought it would. Thanks! I've gotten a lot of requests for back-<br/>ground info on Ranma, so I'm thinking about maybe doing a few prequel<br/>chapters on his earlier adventures, but that could change. I asked<br/>for suggestions for what world Ranma and the senshi should be on and<br/>the best one was Slayers. Unfortunately I don't know enough about the<br/>geography of that universe and my memory is really fuzzy on that<br/>damned complicated stucture of gods it has, so I'm just making my own<br/>world from scratch. My mom's got some sort of pinched nerve in her<br/>back(seriously makes her into more of a bitch) and the medication<br/>she's been taking knocks her out at night. The house could burn down<br/>around her and she wouldn't make a peep, so as long as my family<br/>doesn't rat me out, I should be able to start making some regular<br/>posts at night and sometimes in the afternoon since the library a<br/>couple miles from my house just got online last week. C&amp;C welcome at<br/>dark_<p>
