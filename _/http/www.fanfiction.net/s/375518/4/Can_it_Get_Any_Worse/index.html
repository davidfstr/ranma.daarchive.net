</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 3<p>"Rei told us why you wanted to meet so early, Ranma," Ami said. I<br/>think she was the only one of the senshi capable of forming coherent<br/>words right then.<p>"Good. She might have already told you, but from now on always travel<br/>in at least pairs. That probably won't really help you if these<br/>people are seriously interested in grabbing you, it will however give<br/>one of you a chance to escape and tell me. You girls aren't my<br/>favorite people, but I still have that deal to teach you magic and<br/>you're all basically good at heart, despite your many many faults, so<br/>I will come to the rescue." Ugh, I hate playing good semaritan. Not<br/>that I would leave anyone to be experimented on by a bunch of<br/>incompetent scientists.<p>Usagi sniffled in fear, I thought. Then she said,"Y-you really care!"<br/>That diving glomp/bear hug of hers is pretty effective."Does that mean<br/>you don't hate me? Would you like to come to dinner with me tonight?<br/>The other senshi and me are going to the mall tomorrow, wanna come?"<p>Ami to the rescue. I saw the soft blue light of a spell form in her<br/>hands and the next thing I know, Usagi is snoring on my shoulder. Ami<br/>was too good to be stuck with this bunch. I started making plans to<br/>begin giving her private lessons. She was far enough along to learn<br/>from books without my help and if she improved as quickly as she had<br/>so far, I would soon have a teaching assistant. Listen to me,<br/>sounding like a real teacher. Setsuna will be getting that demonic<br/>yeast infection I'd been saving for a special occassion.<p>"Nice work, might want to work on the amount of visible energy<br/>produced by the casting," I told Ami. I didn't exactly drop Usagi.<br/>It's not my fault that she lost muscle control when she fell asleep.<br/>All that grass and mud broke her fall just fine.<p>"When she wakes up, tell her she was just dreaming, will ya?" I asked<br/>no one in particular."We're going to go off the lesson plan today,"<br/>damnit I just keep getting worse every day,"and I'm going to try to<br/>teach you all a very minor shield spell that you can keep active all<br/>day without draining your own energy. It'll give you a little<br/>protection from the weapons the hunters are using. Don't worry about<br/>waking Usagi, she won't be able to grasp this for at least another<br/>month."<p>The senshi would be starting school again in a few days and out of the<br/>kindness of my heart I had been giving them half days. I kept this in<br/>effect even with the present threat. They wouldn't be very effective<br/>if they were burnt out, afterall. They were piling out of the small<br/>back yard to the shrine residence when I mentally impressed a desire<br/>to talk to Ami on her mind. It's not mind control, especially on<br/>someone as intelligent as the Senshi of Mercury, and she knew what it<br/>was anyway.<p>She was still trying to stuff books into her backpack when she walked<br/>over to me. That's something I don't understand about the girl.<br/>She's smarter than me(really sucks to admit that), and I finished high<br/>school when I was eleven, so she could have easily been through collge<br/>and making lots of money somewhere by now."Sensei? Did you send me a<br/>mental summons just now? I'm not sure if I wasn't just imagining it,"<br/>she said as shyly as ever. Real confidence problem with her.<p>I made sure none of the others were in hearing range and said,"Ami, as<br/>I'm sure you've noticed by now, you are making much better progress<br/>than your friends. Rei and Makoto aren't bad, but honestly, you're<br/>the only one of the senshi that I would have willingly chosen to<br/>teach. You're a natural sorcerress. If you would be willing to take<br/>the time, I could teach you at a much faster pace than the others.<br/>That would help everybody. You could help me teach your friends in<br/>the afternoons after school starts and I could teach you in the<br/>evening."<p>Ami didn't take any time making her mind up, contrary to the hemming<br/>and hawing I had expected. She nodded her head enthusiastically and<br/>said,"That would be wonderful!"<p>It's not like I had anything better to do, so I said,"I don't have any<br/>plans tonight. It would be as good a time to start as any."<p>"That's fine. My mother is carrying an extra shift tonight at the<br/>hospital so she won't know if I stay out late."<p>She ran and caught up with the other senshi and told them something<br/>along the lines of she was getting some extra tutoring or something.<br/>I couldn't tell exactly with the traffic going by the sidewalk.<p>****<p>"Setsuna got it for me," I told Ami when I saw her staring at my huge<br/>apartment in awe."Heh, I bet she wishes she had been a little more<br/>forthcoming with me now."<p>Ami looked at me oddly and asked,"Why's that?"<p>It probably wouldn't be good to tell her what a mess I had made of her<br/>semi-mentor."Oh...nothing. Complex magical stuff you wouldn't<br/>understand." Well that was partially true."Make yourself at home. I'm<br/>gonna fix a sandwhich, want one?"<p>"Sure, that'd be great." She sat down and began flipping through the<br/>channels on my tv. She looked shocked. I understood the feeling. I<br/>never would have believed there were three thousand channels.<p>We ate our sandwhiches and finished watching a news program on the<br/>Sailor Senshi. I couldn't help but laugh at some of the ideas people<br/>had about these girls. Secret government super soldiers was the best<br/>though. I mean, super soldiers, it was too funny to believe. I had<br/>to keep myself from falling over laughing because Ami appeared<br/>flattered by the show and I didn't want to hurt her feelings.<p>"You're going to need an athame before we can go much further," I<br/>commented when the program was finished.<p>"A what?" Ami asked.<p>"Ritual knife. It helps to focus energy into finer and more coherent<br/>patterns. There are a lot of spells that can't be performed without<br/>one until you have a lot of experience." I pulled mine from it's wrist<br/>sheath."You've seen me use it to draw the spell patterns in the air?"<br/>Ami nodded."I could have done it without the athame but it would have<br/>taken more energy and the image wouldn't have remained legible for<br/>nearly so long."<p>"Uh, where can I get an...athame?" she asked.<p>"I'm pretty sure there are at least a few shops in Tokyo that sell<br/>them, but for now I have one you can borrow." It took a minute of<br/>digging through my luggage to find the plain copper bladed<br/>dagger."Copper doesn't draw and focus as much energy as iron," I told<br/>her."It'll be easier to learn with it."<p>Ami took the proffered blade and tested the weight and feel. As she<br/>stroked it through the air a blue spark leapt from the blade. It's<br/>nice to be right all the time.<p>"What do you think about ice flame?"<p>****<p>Wouldn't you know it would be just like Usagi to decide to walk to the<br/>store for a quick ice cream fix in the middle of the night? I knew I<br/>should have put that mental block on her earlier. Ami, being the only<br/>member of the senshi to know where I lived, arrived early, like 6<br/>a.m., beating on my door frantically. It was their first day of<br/>school and I was sleeping in late, content with the knowledge that I<br/>didn't have to see the meatball head for an extra six or seven hours.<p>"All right, all right!" I shouted."I'm coming! Hold your horses!" I<br/>threw open the door, an invisible blade of force gathered in my free<br/>hand.<p>Ami rushed in, nearly knocking me over in my sleep fogged<br/>mind."Usagi's missing," she informed me."We always get her up<br/>especially early on the first day of school and the beginning of the<br/>new semester so that she can find her way to her classes. It was my<br/>turn today," she rambled on while I was getting dressed. One day I<br/>was going to get caught without that damned ring on and there would be<br/>a world of trouble for me. Thankfully she didn't see me in the<br/>darkened apartment until I had activated its enchantment.<p>"Are you sure she didn't just go to school on her own?" Even I knew<br/>that idea was a joke.<p>The look she shot me made me proud. It was my 'what kind of idiot are<br/>you' stare.<p>I didn't waste any time. If Usagi felt sufficiently threatened and<br/>was frightened enough she could start up the magical howitzer act<br/>again. She still had more than enough control over that crystal.<br/>They, whoever they were, would probably just kill her instead of<br/>trying to subdue an energy and speech spouting weapon of<br/>destruction."Where are the others?"<p>"They're waiting down in the lobby. Luna and Artemis are with them."<br/>She knew that I didn't like the moon cats and that they didn't like<br/>me. I think they could smell a similarity between my female form and<br/>my natural male form.<p>I nodded and we headed out the door. The senshi were indeed waiting<br/>in the lobby, already transformed into full battle armor with their<br/>weapons drawn and a primed spell crackling in the free hand. Ami<br/>activated the modified transformation sequence and within minutes I<br/>was leading four pissed off senshi down the nearly abandoned street.<br/>If it had been any of the other girls I would have had to perform a<br/>spell to locate them, but Usagi and her crystal were easy enough to<br/>track down that I could just follow my nose, figuratively, of course.<p>At the speed we were travelling we arrived in the warehouse district<br/>within half an hour. That's quite an accomplishment when you consider<br/>that it was on the other side of the city with all those big buildings<br/>in the way.<p>"No mercy. You see someone in black, they die. If any of you have a<br/>problem with that then go home now and leave the rescuing to me." I<br/>thought that at least Minako and probably Ami would bale out. I was<br/>wrong. If anything, they're expressions became more fierce and they<br/>followed along right behind me. Damn, how can someone like Usagi<br/>inspire such loyalty? Must have something to do with pity.<p>There wasn't much I could do about any surveilance cameras, not while<br/>keeping myself wrapped in the equivalent of a magical nuclear<br/>bombshelter, but the people set to keep watch were another story. I<br/>dropped three of them before the senshi even knew they were being<br/>watched. A man rose up from a pile of garbage to my left while I was<br/>flinging silent blades of air into a building across the street that<br/>had housed two lookouts. Before I could react, Makoto had roasted the<br/>man alive and we were moving on.<p>I hung back and let the senshi work off a little steam on the next<br/>dozen. They worked better than I would have thought. I choose to<br/>believe much of that was due to my influence. I didn't spend any time<br/>looking for a way into the windowless warehouse that my senses told me<br/>was our destination. A flexing of magical muscles, you could say, and<br/>I ripped the shorter wall off and threw it onto another warehouse.<p>Oh boy, what a slaugter! I had inadvertently freed a whole freakin<br/>bunch of captured demons, super powerful martial artists, and devil<br/>hunters. They were all in a bad mood. They were all much more<br/>powerful than their captors. The senshi and I flowed through the<br/>massacre, looking for Usagi before we let ourselves have any fun.<p>The girl in question was unconscious and strapped down to a metal<br/>table with some kind of force field generator forming a bubble around<br/>her. Technology may be improving, but it is certainly no match for<br/>good old human ingenuity combined with lots and lots of power. I<br/>would have used some of that power to destroy the bubble if Ami hadn't<br/>found the power switch and flipped it off. Sigh, at least I got to<br/>kill some people.<p>By now the various groups had gathered together. Demons of at least a<br/>dozen varieties were feasting on dead and dying men and women. Devil<br/>hunters, who I guess had been confined in the same kind of force field<br/>Usagi had because they weren't holding back on their mystical<br/>retribution, were taking turns blasting their captors. The martial<br/>artists, some I actually recognized, were just beating the ever living<br/>shit out of their victims. I saw a couple moderately powerful chi<br/>based attacks in the melee.<p>Someone was going to learn a lesson not to mess with their betters. A<br/>little technology just wasn't going to cut it.<p>With Usagi over my shoulder, I said,"We better get out of here before<br/>the demons and devil hunters notice each other." Rei started to<br/>protest."Remember the minding their own business rule? That's still<br/>in effect. Some of those demons are children that were probably taken<br/>right out of their beds in the middle of the night. Besides, the<br/>cops, and very likely the government are going to be showing up soon.<br/>I don't want to be here when they do."<p>I got silent and grim nods from the girls and we bean to cut out way<br/>through the mob. Along the way I saw a pair of chaos demons trying to<br/>get out through the hole I had made in the wall. One was injured and<br/>being helped along by the other.<p>"Phil!" I called out."Is that you?" The demons turned around and<br/>started waving to me. Yep, it was Phil and Cindy."Be on your best<br/>behavior, girls. These are friends of mine."<p>"I can't believe she's friends with demons," I heard Rei mutter to one<br/>of the other senshi.<p>"Ami said that she told her demons saved her life when she was a kid,"<br/>Makoto responded. Good girl, Ami is.<p>We caught up with the pair of demons and I passed Usagi to Makoto,<br/>throwing Phil's arm over my shoulder."When did they get you?" I asked.<p>Cindy answered,"Phil was having a craving for liver the night before<br/>last and it'd been a while since I had any, so we went out and..." The<br/>female demon finally seemed to notice the company I was keeping.<p>"Don't worry. They won't bother you," I assured her."Senshi, meet<br/>Phil and Cindy. Phil is one of my oldest friends and Cindy is his<br/>girlfriend." I still haven't figured out how Phil managed that."Phil<br/>and Cindy, these are the Sailor Senshi. I'm still teaching them<br/>magic."<p>"Hey," Cindy said awkwardly."Sorry we got off on the wrong foot last<br/>time. I guess I can understand where you're coming from though."<br/>Cindy must be one of those human rights demons.<p>"Yeah," Phil agreed, groaning through the pain of a smashed leg.<br/>"Thanks, by the way, for getting us out of that hell hole." That got a<br/>laugh from me and the girls.<p>The streets were slowly starting to feel with morning commuters and<br/>people going about their business. We were already drawing more than<br/>our fair share of strange looks. "Cindy, can you heal Phil up good<br/>enough to hold him over until tonight?"<p>"No problem," she responded.<p>"Good. You two are going to have to hide out somewhere today. My<br/>place is too far away and there are too many people out on the streets<br/>already." I had already begun mentally going through likely places for<br/>them to lay low.<p>"That alley over there," Phil pointed to the alley in<br/>question."Someone must've dies there recently. It's still got a fair<br/>amount of negative energy swirling around. Cindy'll be able to work<br/>better there."<p>"Right," I agreed. The senshi stayed where they were as Cindy and I<br/>helped Phil across the street. Once they were comfortable I spun a<br/>kind of illusion that wasn't really an illusion, just a kind of<br/>blurred after image of the buildings beside it that would encourage<br/>people's eyes to skip over it. I couldn't do much better than that.<p>"They seemed pretty nice," Minako said when I returned. They had<br/>changed back into cute little school girls, complete with uniforms and<br/>school bags. Usagi was still out of it and in her pajamas. I sure as<br/>hell wasn't going to volunteer to do the honors.<p>"They are. Most demons are like normal people. It's the screw ups<br/>that give them all a bad name. I'm sure you all have plenty of time<br/>before school starts, but she," I indicated Usagi,"isn't even<br/>dressed..."<p>Ami spoke up."It is my turn to get her ready. If we hurry we won't be<br/>late."<p>I left them to decide how to work out their arduous task of taking the<br/>meatball head to school. Ami sure wouldn't ba able to carry her<br/>across town, not without transforming. I wondered what they would<br/>tell her parents. Sleepwalking, most likely.<p>****<p>I was sitting in one of those tiny little street corner cafes sipping<br/>a cup of atrociously sweet coffee and watching an old episode of<br/>Dragonball when the broadcast was interrupted by a special news<br/>report. Turns out that those dead guys were government afterall.<br/>They were claiming that a terrorist death cult that the guys had been<br/>investigating had made a preemptive strike and slaughtered them all.<br/>All the shredded and partially eaten, blown up, and burnt bodies leant<br/>that story a lot of credit.<p>I was just hoping that they had kept whatever file they had on me in<br/>that warehouse. Doubt it, though. Life had been getting a little<br/>stagnant lately. A couple years of making the hunters into the prey<br/>would be fun. I could even get the senshi and some demons in on it.<p>****<p>"What happened?" the Emperor demanded shrilly.<p>The older man dressed in a cliche black suit bowed repeatedly, finally<br/>bringing himself to say,"The base was overwhelmed, sir. We have only<br/>fragments of the remaining security tapes, but it appears that case #<br/>54687, Ranma Saotome, led case #'s 34532 through 34535 on a rescue<br/>mission for case # 34531. In the process they freed all captured<br/>individuals."<p>"Fools, all fools," the Emperor snapped."You were specifically<br/>instructed to enlist the aide of all supernaturally gifted citizens in<br/>Japan, not to hunt them down like demonic scum! Now you and your<br/>incompetents may have made an enemy of Our most potentially powerful<br/>allies."<p>"Yes, your Highness. Whoever misconstrued your decree shall be<br/>immediately dealt with," the man replied.<p>"Of course this fiasco was not your fault, correct? No, not your<br/>fault at all. I want those who were held against their will contacted<br/>and properly reimbursed with whatever they feel they are owed. The<br/>time is coming when We will need them all to fight for Us willingly.<br/>Now get out."<p>(I have no idea what Imperial protocol is in Japan. This will have to<br/>do. Oh and I know that the Emperor is really just some kind of<br/>figurehead, but this is my story so he could be a three headed monky<br/>if I wanted him to.)<p>****<p>"Ami, I want you to take Rei, Makoto, and Minako through the first<br/>spell I taught you last night. I'm going to try to get Usagi caught<br/>up." Somehow.<p>"I still don't see why you get special lessons," Rei muttered. She<br/>likes to do that a lot, talking about people behind their backs, I<br/>mean. Enhanced senses can pick up all kinds of nice things.<p>"Ranma-sensei just thinks that I learn faster," Ami resonded to the<br/>jab. That Ranma-sensei bit is pretty cool. Not too many people give<br/>me much respect. I admit that not too many people who know me are<br/>human, though. If I had been in Ami's position I would have just told<br/>Rei the simple truth that I was ten time's the sorceress she would<br/>ever be and for her to kiss my ass. Too bad there aren't more people<br/>like me in the world.<p>"Now, Usagi, I'm going to draw this spell in very simple pieces. I<br/>want you to tell me when you understand one so that I can add the next<br/>part." At this rate she would be able to cast the spell in a week.<p>"Sure thing Ranma," she said cheerfully, showing no sign that she had<br/>been kidnapped only hours earlier."Thanks for rescuing me. Those men<br/>were going to dissect me. What does dissect mean? Would it have<br/>hurt?"<p>I sighed. Another long day in a series of long days.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: I think I'm going to try to cross this over with The<br/>Black Company by Glen Cook in a few chapters. Somewhere in the Shadow<br/>Games book. If you haven't read the series I highly recommend it.<br/>I've gotten lots of responses on this and some pretty good<br/>suggestions. Keep them coming.
