</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 16<p>I was the last to step through portal, right after Telerin. If<br/>something went wrong, I didn't want any of the girls trapped here<br/>without anything but pokemon as company.<p>The portal deposited me on a huge area of brown and yellowish stone<br/>that looked as if it had been ground down and polished to a mirror<br/>sheen. This was where the mountain had been that had been transported<br/>us to the first world. There was a twenty foot high chain link and<br/>razor wire fence surrounding the entire surface. The government<br/>hiding their screw ups, I guess.<p>"Wow, if this got wet, we could slide around forever. Wouldn't that<br/>be fun!" That was Usagi. As jubilant as ever, she may be, but that<br/>little idea she'd just spun out of the wide open expanse that is her<br/>mind could actually be profitable. The government wouldn't sale,<br/>anyway.<p>"Yeah, Usagi, that would be fun," I answered her."But right now, we<br/>should probably be getting back and seeing if everyone thanks that<br/>we're dead. If we've been gone long enough for a fence that size to<br/>be put up..." I left it hanging, knowing she could finish the concept.<p>"Oh no! My parents must think I'm dead! Wah! I bet Shingo took<br/>my room! Who's been feeding Luna? Waaaahhh!" We all watched<br/>Usagi run around in circles, pulling wads of her own hair out and<br/>occassionally slipping on the smooth surface below.<p>"We might all be dead, legally, I mean," Makoto said cheerfully. She<br/>didn't have any parents to worry about so the idea must have been<br/>pretty novel to her."My apartment was paid off for six months when we<br/>left, so it should still be there."<p>I just stepped back and let the senshi worry themselves sick about<br/>what their parents thought, how much makeup work they would have from<br/>school, that was a big one for Ami, and all kinds of little stuff.<br/>Usagi for instance, declared that she was going to break her ice cream<br/>consumption record everyday of the week for a month.<p>"Anyway," I said loudly,"we should be getting back now. I'm sure that<br/>there are people who want to see you and we really shouldn't wait<br/>around here for some of those commandoes to come after us. We were<br/>working for the government when a mountain, along with us, vanished.<br/>They probably covered it up and made everything out to be one big<br/>accident." Oh let them try, just let them try. I was itching for a<br/>chance to loose my power on something and in the process blow it up.<p>Minako rose into the air slowly, as if unsure whether or not the spell<br/>would work."This feels great!" she exclaimed."I didn't realize how<br/>boring life can be without magic!" That degenerated into a match of<br/>airborne tag, somehow. I let myself be brought into the game just for<br/>a chance to chase Ami around for a couple minutes.<p>Finally, and this was like two hours after we'd gotten home, I managed<br/>to convince the girls that we should be leaving. With her magic back<br/>to full strength, Usagi was able to store all of her pokeballs in a<br/>spatial pocket and eliminate any need for us all to split the burden.<br/>I'm going to have to get Ami to show me how to make one of those<br/>pockets someday. The senshi each have one naturally. It's not fair.<p>"You can't let your pokemon out to play either, Usagi," Rei warned.<br/>Her two new pokemon eggs hadn't hatched, but already her attitude was<br/>improving. Amazing. She had a point. Most of our pokemon would<br/>appear demonic to the citizens of Juuban, who had endured years of<br/>silly looking demons and daemons. My Demon would cause a city wide<br/>panic and probably warrant an attack by the Bible Rangers.<p>Hmmm, maybe Demon could make an appearance afterall. I could have him<br/>wonder around Tokyo eating trees and cars and as soon as the Bible<br/>Rangers showed up, he could roast them alive in their robot. Yes, I<br/>think I will. That way my good deed for the century will be taken<br/>care of.<p>****<p>Katya led her sister, a much cleaner, though still obese, over to the<br/>Gates of Time and Space. The Senshi of Time's uniform had been<br/>mystically tailored so that the ruffles and bows managed to hide most<br/>of the rolls, but the green-haired senshi was still looking like<br/>something of a rolly polly.<p>Katya looked at the simple ring of metal and frowned. She pulled a<br/>hanky from thin air and spit on it, then began buffing a small panel<br/>at the top of the ring that had become tarnished. It'd read 'Gates of<br/>Time', but when Katya finished and moved back, the panel said 'Gates<br/>of Time and Space'."Little sister, couldn't you have at least kept the<br/>thing clean?" The Senshi of Space asked.<p>Setsuna shrugged, setting three of her chins to bobbing."I didn't<br/>think you had been reincarnated. If the other senshi had seen that,<br/>they would have asked unpleasant questions." Setsuna had really just<br/>wanted all trace of her sister gone from her sight. Katya had always<br/>been prettier, better in every way, and all the nobles had always<br/>asked her to dance. Setsuna couldn't help that she had an attitude<br/>problem. It ran in the family. But 'Katya' hadn't gotten that<br/>particular Meiou trait, no, she was too good for an attitude.<p>Katya sighed."I suppose that makes sense. Now that I'm back, though,<br/>we should be able to find our missing senshi." Katya made her silver<br/>staff appear and tapped the edge of the ring, realigning her powers<br/>with the Space half of the Gates of Time and Space.<p>Setsuna glowered at her sister's back. Why did Katya get the<br/>impressive staff, while she was stuck with a giant key with a heart on<br/>it?<p>"I'll just start by perusing through the nearer dimensions. They are<br/>most similar to our own plane and more likely to draw accidental<br/>travellers," Katya said.<p>Leave it to her older sister to just barge in and ruin everything.<br/>Ranma 'had' taken the senshi, Ranma 'was' evil, and Ranma 'must' die!<br/>The answer came to an unasked question came to Setsuna then. Katya<br/>was being manipulated just like she had. That must be it! Well,<br/>she'd show her sister, she'd show her who was the better woman.<p>"This may take a while," Katya told her gently."If you want, you can<br/>sit down." That much weight must be killing her ankles.<p>****<p>The key still unlocked the door to my apartment and my stuff was still<br/>there. I hadn't expected any of the food in the fridge to be good,<br/>but the soft drinks I'd left in it were fine. I passed them out to<br/>the senshi and said,"You can't just go up to your parents and say,<br/>'Hey look, I'm alive!'. That would be bad. There would be heart<br/>attacks and stuff like that."<p>Ami asked,"How should we break the news? I don't like sitting here<br/>when I know my Mom is nearby and believes me to be dead." Ami's mom<br/>sounded like a nice lady from what she'd told me, but I didn't want to<br/>be the one held responsible for her daughter's disappearance.<p>"How much do you care about your secret identities?" I asked. My idea<br/>would work, if and only if the girls let their parents in on their<br/>little secret.<p>"You're not serious?" Rei snapped. What's her problem? Her<br/>grandfather already knew that she was Sailor Mars.<p>I shrugged."Why not? They're bound to find out someday. Hell, they<br/>may know now." Adults aren't stupid, they just have problems seeing<br/>the world around them sometimes. Besides, the government(I'm really<br/>starting to hate that word) could have broke the news and used it as<br/>an excuse to exonerate themselves of responsibility.<p>"It's fine with me," Makoto shrugged. Ha ha, real funny.<p>"Ranma, you haven't really been raised by normal human beings," Ami<br/>said gently. "Parents try to protect their children from harm. I know<br/>that my Mom would do everything in her power to stop me from being a<br/>senshi. She's just overprotective." She had a point. Demons did tend<br/>to live more for the moment and future existance be damned, but I knew<br/>where she was coming from. The short time I'd spent with my own<br/>Mother had had its share of arguments and lectures related to my way<br/>of life.<p>"How can they stop you?" I asked."I don't mean for you to attack your<br/>parents." Geeze, they'd all got that impending violence look in their<br/>eyes."We'll just explain how the world needs you and tell them that<br/>lots and lots of people will die without your help. Usagi, you being<br/>a princess might help some too."<p>Now that I'd introduced a way for them to guilt trip their parents<br/>into letting them be superheroes, the senshi got all excited and<br/>wanted to get started. Teenage girls sure can change their minds<br/>fast.<p>****<p>(This takes place a couple days before Ranma and the gang get back to<br/>Earth)<p>With the help of the one use Phoenix Person curse packets that Cologne<br/>had given to Shampoo, and some duck ones that Mousse had 'borrowed'(no<br/>one really used the duck ones anyway), the pair of Amazons reached the<br/>Chinese coast within a week. After resting and taking a short amount<br/>of time to get a bearing from the Orb, a duck and a winged Shampoo set<br/>out for Japan.<p>Shampoo couldn't get enough of flying and the personal freedom it<br/>brought her. She also liked being able to talk to birds. They were a<br/>scittish, airheaded lot, but they were always so happy and the way<br/>they talked about their babies and nests brought a smile to the<br/>serious amazon's face. She could even talk to Mousse in his duck<br/>form.<p>"Shampoo no speak stupid language good," the winged Amazon told her<br/>companion in Japanese.<p>In duckish, Mousse said,"If we are to move around in Japan well enough<br/>to find Ranma, we must be able to speak the language. I can't always<br/>translate for you." Mousse wasn't flying alongside his love, instead<br/>he was held tightly in her arms, right against her generous bosom.<br/>Mousse's little wings simply couldn't keep up with Shampoo's. He<br/>didn't care. He was in heaven.<p>"Shampoo know that stu-," She stopped."Damnit, I can not speak<br/>Japanese. It makes me sound like a complete idiot. I don't know how<br/>you learned it. Stupid language for a stupid people," Shampoo<br/>grumbled."With the exception of Ranma. Being raised by Hell beasts<br/>must have burnt the dumbness out of him."<p>Mousse did the equivalent of a duck growl."Ranma was never a dumb<br/>beast!" he exclaimed."Ranma is a great and powerful sorceror."<p>Shampoo patted the duck on his head and said,"Of course, Mousse,<br/>whatever you say."<p>****<p>Usagi's parents were the first of the adults to arrive at my<br/>apartment. They looked depressed and I could feel the emotion<br/>bubbling beneath the surface of their thoughts. They wanted to know<br/>what I had called them for, who I was, and all kinds of other crap. I<br/>just told them that others would soon be arriving and that it would be<br/>easier to explain once and not have to answer the same questions<br/>repeatedly. I had wanted to tell them individually, but the girls had<br/>out-voted me and since they were the backbone of the plan, I had to go<br/>along with them.<p>Minako's dad knocked on the door a few minutes later. He explained<br/>that his wife was out of the country on business and then followed the<br/>Tsuniko pattern pretty closely. I gave him the run around and turned<br/>him loose to talk with Usagi's parents.<p>Ami's mother wasn't very happy being called in the middle of a shift<br/>at the hospital, but the urgency I had expressed got her attention<br/>enough to see what I had to say. Ms. Mizuno was an older version of<br/>Ami, still very attractive and looking younger than her forty odd<br/>years. It's good to know that Ami will still be hot in a thousand<br/>years.<p>Grandfather Hino was the last to arrive, and he was a little cheerier<br/>than I had expected. Then again, he was a partially trained sorceror<br/>himself. He might have felt Rei's prescence and figured out what was<br/>about to happen. Lot of wasted potential there.<p>"Okay," I said to the little gathering. They were arranged around my<br/>living room and Minako's dad had been flipping through the porn<br/>channels on my tv when he thought no one was watching. I reminded<br/>myself to tell Minako about that."I appreciate you all being able to<br/>make it here tonight and the reason for the secrecy will soon become<br/>apparent." Well, I haven't hosted very many secret identity coming out<br/>parties before. You can't expect me to be good at it.<p>"Could you get on with it, please?" Ms. Mizuno asked. I got the<br/>distinct impression that she had thrown herself into her work to take<br/>her mind off of her daughter's disappearance.<p>We had determined, thanks to a calender and a newspaper, that we'd<br/>been gone for a little under six weeks."Recently, I believe, each of<br/>you lost a child." There were sharp intakes of breath from three of<br/>them, a smile from one, and a glare from the other.<p>"If you've brought us here to remind us of our loss," began Mrs.<br/>Tsuniko, standing up and pulling her husband with her,"we'll be going.<br/>And you can expect a call from our lawyer!" she hissed.<p>"Hey wait, you got it all wrong!" I said. Stupid plan, I should have<br/>never let them talk me into it."Ah damn, girls, come on out," I<br/>called. Screw it. Usagi and I can fix anything less than a stroke.<p>The senshi, except for Makoto who had gone to her apartment with<br/>Telerin so as not to complicate anything tonight, came out of my<br/>bedroom in their civilian forms. They must have heard that things<br/>weren't going too well for me or they would have been transformed like<br/>the plan had originally called for.<p>There were squeals, gasps, a scream, lots of wailing from Minako's<br/>dad, and tears, bunches of tears. I just stood back and enjoyed the<br/>show.<p>"Usagi, you are so so so grounded!" Mrs. Tsuniko shouted in between<br/>hugs and kisses."You're never leaving your room again!"<p>"Waaaaaahhhhhhh! My baby girl came back! Waaaaaaahhhhhh!"<br/>Minako was starting to turn a little purple within her father's<br/>crushing grasp.<p>This was ridiculous. I eventually gave up and went to the corner<br/>convenience mart to pick up some snacks. When I got back they were<br/>finally starting to lose some steam. I was in the middle of eating a<br/>sandwhich when everyone pulled themselves together and the girls were<br/>able to escape from their parents long enough to gather together.<p>"Um, Mom, you see, we were gone because, well, it's kinda hard to<br/>explain...Ranma?" Usagi finished, pointing at me desperately. All<br/>eyes turned towards me. Hey, this wasn't my part.<p>I sat there, my sandwhich stuck in my mouth, for over a minute while<br/>they just stared at me. I got tired of it and finished that<br/>bite."Fine, if you all are to chicken to say it, I will. Parents and<br/>grandparent, your children and grandchild were gone because they are<br/>the Sailor Senshi and we had all been trapped in another universe.<br/>I'm Ranma and I teach them magic. We got back a few hours ago." The<br/>silence was truly profound. I heard crickets chirping, despite being<br/>well above street level and far from any park.<p>"Usagi is Sailor Moon, and the reincarnated Princess of the Moon<br/>Kingdom, and she first lived during the Silver Millenium about...ten<br/>thousand years ago, I think. Ami is Sailor Mercury, advisor and<br/>guardian to the Princess. Rei is Sailor Mars and I think she was<br/>guardian and assassin for the royal family. Ami's computer is a<br/>little sketchy on that one." I ticked off the next finger."Minako is<br/>Sailor Venus, also an advisor and guardian to the Princess. That<br/>about sums it up, well excpet for Makoto who is Sailor Jupiter, but<br/>she's an orphan and didn't want to intrude on the reunion." The<br/>following 'blink blink' was actually audible.<p>Ms. Mizuno's eyes narrowed and she looked at her daughter closely,<br/>nodding to herself. Grandfather Hino just smiled at Rei and grinned<br/>knowingly at me. The Tsunikos decided to blink a few more times, then<br/>together, they seemed to actually accept what I said as true,<br/>apparently fitting suspiscious little instances together into<br/>something that proved me as not insane.<p>Mr. Hina did't quite want to believe me, though."Are you a lunatic?<br/>My precious little Minako," Heh, Minako turned red,"would never fight<br/>monsters. She's too nice to do that. Why, if she breaks a nail, we<br/>have to listen to her whine about it for days." That last one was most<br/>definitely true.<p>I made a curvy little gesture with my hand and the senshi clasped<br/>their hands together and murmmurred the activation phrase to their<br/>altered senshi transformation. There wasn't any twirling involved,<br/>and pretty ribbons didn't turn into magical underwear. Nope, my<br/>transformation spell was much faster and more practical. A flash of<br/>light, white for Usagi, red for Rei, yellow for Minako, and blue for<br/>Ami, and the girls were gone, replced by Sailor Senshi. Their color<br/>coded body armor, glowing with power, covered most of their bodies,<br/>leaving only their upper arms and parts of their thighs unprotected by<br/>the actual armor. Planes of force covered the bare flesh with<br/>invisible barriers. Each girl's visor partially covered her face, but<br/>enough was visible that their identities, when the glamore was not in<br/>effect, were clearly recognizable.<p>Mr. Hina's head *thumped* as he passed out, slumping out of the chair<br/>he had occupied and colliding with my coffee table. That would leave<br/>a mark.<p>"These costumes are much better than the old ones, don't you think?" I<br/>asked, drawing the still conscious adults' attention away from the<br/>senshi."The skirts had been so tiny before, you really should be glad<br/>that I did that." They all nodded to that. I think they were stunned<br/>speechless. Maybe they hadn't believed me before the demonstration,<br/>afterall.<p>****<p>The moment of truth. The others, parents and grandparent in one case<br/>in tow, had left my apartment. Except for Ami and Ms. Mizuno. Yes,<br/>now you see. BIG moment of truth. Just encase my lover's warning<br/>hadn't been jokes, I'd woven a couple barriers around myself. Not<br/>that I expected the women to get through my defenses, but eyes take so<br/>long to grow back that I didn't want to risk losing one.<p>Ami was in her mom's grip, being rocked back and forth by the happy<br/>woman."Oh Ami, I missed you so much," was repeated constantly with a<br/>few,"I'm so proud of you,"'s thrown in for variety. Ami broke away<br/>from her mother and stood up in front of her.<p>"Mom, no one was really properly introduced to Ranma," Ami said."He's<br/>taught us so much and without him we may have been in a laboratory<br/>somewhere being experimented on now instead of back home." I smiled<br/>and waved, deciding I should just keep my big mouth shut.<p>"You're an adult, and you understand what it feels like to care for<br/>someone in a mature fashion," Ami continued.<p>I had to say it or Ami would beat around the bush for hours."Sorry<br/>Ami, your Mom is starting to look impatient," I said. Ami looked<br/>really, really relieved."Ms. Mizuno, your daughter and I have been<br/>sleeping together for a while now and are, well, I guess in...l-l-<br/>love." THAT was majorly hard to squeeze out."When magically gifted<br/>people become truly involved and committed to one another, they<br/>sometimes form a bond that links their thoughts together and<br/>eventually their lives. Ami and I have such a bond. It's permanent.<br/>So you see, we, actually Ami, would like your permission for us be<br/>engaged with the intent to marry when she finishes school." Whew, I<br/>said it, and much better than I would have believed possible.<p>Ami grinned sheepishly at her mother. Ms. Mizuno then proceeded to<br/>examine me like a piece of meat. I was getting nervous when she<br/>finally said,"I guess you'll do. Now come give me a hug." I didn't<br/>have much choice. I let her hug me. In my ear she whispered,"Thank<br/>you, Ranma, you don't know how much this means to me."<p>****<p>"Hey Setsy," Katya said to Setsuna, who was eating a bag of chips and<br/>reading a magazine while her sister looked for the senshi.<p>"Don't start calling me that again," Setsuna snapped. During her<br/>entire childhood, Katya had only called her Setsuna three times. It<br/>had been Setsy all the other times.<p>"Now that I've got your attention, I should tell you that the senshi<br/>and Ranma have returned to this universe. Actually, I just watched<br/>the senshi reveal their identities to their parents. Then Ranma<br/>announced to Ami's mother that he and the Senshi of Mercury were soul-<br/>bonded and that they were planning on getting married. Isn't that<br/>sweet?" Katya loved weddings. She would arrange a nice ceremonial<br/>meteor shower for the couple whenever they got around to tying the<br/>knot.<p>Setsuna dropped her chips and magazine and stood up in a flurry of<br/>wobbling blubber. What had Ranma done to her senshi? How could he<br/>have brainwashed Ami, the smart one, so easily? He had to die! She<br/>called the Garnet rod to her chubby little hand and disappeaared with<br/>a pop.<p>"Now what is she up to?" Katya asked the space where her sister had<br/>been sitting.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: I said that lots of stuff would happen this chapter,<br/>but I was wrong. That happens a lot when I write because I never<br/>really plan what the next chapter is gonna be about. That's part of<br/>why I never finish a fic. Next chapter, I promise, will be full of<br/>Setsuna getting her ass kicked and all kinds of other interesting<br/>stuff. I think that I took the whole revelation of the identities too<br/>lightly and faster than I should have, but now it's over and the story<br/>can move along with the world domination part. C&amp;C me at<br/>dark_<p>Later<p>
