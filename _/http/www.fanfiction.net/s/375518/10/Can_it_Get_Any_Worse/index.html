</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 9<p>"Now that Usagi is famous, I think it'd be best if we left. Demon<br/>will have the whole region depopulated before long, too." I hadn't<br/>mentioned any of the conversation I'd overheard about Ami's condition.<br/>What was there to say? I'd gotten Ami pregnant. She knew about it,<br/>if she'd told her friends, and didn't seem to be acting any different.<br/>Mature and intelligent as my lover was, she was still a sixteen year<br/>old girl. In her situation, I would be flipping out. Whatever we<br/>decided to do with the kid, it wouldn't be on this planet, a place<br/>where animal eggs were given more attention than babies.<p>Demon gurgled happily, swinging a lamppost around trying to hit Rei's<br/>rat. The pokemon's massive frame must top at least twenty feet now.<br/>The wings, when unfolded, cast shadows over huge areas of ground, not<br/>unlike a large cloud. He, and I had finally learned Demon was a he,<br/>had figured out how to retract his two foot long claws. I hope his<br/>growth slows down some, or he'll eat me out of house and home. My<br/>other pokemon were virtually forgotten with Demon's birth. I'm<br/>probably just going to give them away before we leave, or let Ami have<br/>them.<p>"But, Ranma, I have a worldwide tour to go on!" Usagi protested.<br/>Taking care of pokemon and living on her own had helped the girl to<br/>grow up quite a bit, but not enough.<p>"If you were to disappear right after winning the championship, then<br/>reappear next year to compete in the next one, don't you think it<br/>would make people think you were all mysterious and stuff?" Makoto<br/>asked. That was a pretty good idea, especially because by next year<br/>the girls would be strong enough to bring Usagi to PokeWorld without<br/>my help. I certainly have no intention of returning.<p>"Well, that does sound neat...but the Pokemon League is going to make<br/>a doll to look like me. Can we at least stay until they get it right?<br/>Please?" A few more days wouldn't hurt, unless Demon decided to raid<br/>the pokemon center. A little time to think about how to talk to Ami<br/>about the pregnancy would be good too.<p>"Only a few more days," I answered. There was a loud crash, followed<br/>by a metallic screeching behind me. I whirled around, expecting to<br/>come under attack, I'd been getting complacent, only to see Demon<br/>using his lamp post to smash a large hole in the street."Bad Demon,<br/>bad!" I shouted. I floated over to him, rising slowly until I could<br/>look him straight in his basketball sized black eyes. I glared at him<br/>and asked,"What have I told you about smashing stuff? Bad Demon." I<br/>pointed at the pokemon and said,"No supper for you tonight." Do not<br/>say a word. Demon's lower lip began to tremble, for all of it's meter<br/>long length, and great big fist sized tears gathered in his eyes. He<br/>snuffled and let out a high keening sound, revealing his foot long<br/>fangs. I couldn't stand to see the big guy cry like that so I said<br/>gently,"All right Demon, you can have supper tonight, but this is your<br/>last warning. No more smashing other people's stuff!" Demon's tears<br/>disappeared like they'd never even existed and his big black lips<br/>split into a razor sharp grin of contentment.<p>As I descended to the ground and walked towards the senshi, Demon<br/>spread his wings and took flight, nearly blowing me over with the gail<br/>force wind kicked up by the takeoff. The senshi were all grinning at<br/>me when I returned. Crap.<p>"Mama Ranma, you're so mean," teased Minako, who broke into giggles as<br/>I momentarily choked on my tongue.<p>"You shouldn't have gone so easy on him, Ranma," Rei chided,<br/>absentmindedly scratching her giant rat behind the ear.<p>I waved it off and said,"He's already bigger than almost every other<br/>kind of pokemon on this whole world and not showing any sign that his<br/>growth will slow down or stop. I don't want to have a hundred foot<br/>pokemon decide that it doesn't love me anymore and try to make a meal<br/>out of me." I could take him down if Demon ever turned on me, but I<br/>doubt he'll ever do anything like that."And he was crying," I added.<br/>The thing may look as evil as any true demon, but Demon had the heart<br/>of a puppy.<p>I caught sight of Ami giving me a considering look, very much unlike<br/>the mock looks of suprise and shock from the other senshi. Yes, us<br/>two were definitely going to have a talk. Soon. As soon as I could<br/>figure out what to say, anyway.<p>****<p>"Ranma is an evil sorceror?" Nabiki asked in confirmation to Ryoga's<br/>earlier comment. Genma had escaped from Akane as soon as she had<br/>stopped hitting him with her mallet. Ryoga just sat in a chair,<br/>looking none the worse for wear even though Akane had tried to beat<br/>him into a pulp.<p>Ryoga nodded eargerly. They surrounded him. All three girls kept<br/>looking at him. Ryoga could barely breathe."He cursed me to turn into<br/>a pig whenever I get spalshed with cold water," Ryoga growled<br/>weakly."That was the last time I fought him. The time before that he<br/>made a demon appear." Ryoga shuddered."It tried to eat me." He raised<br/>his tunic up above his chest. There were a trio of thick scars<br/>running from just below his collar to the waist of his left side.<p>Nabiki didn't believe a word of it. Ryoga himself seemed convinced<br/>that he spoke the truth, though."Are you sure you weren't attacked by<br/>a bear?" she asked as she walked to the sink and filled a glass with<br/>water.<p>"Bears don't breathe fire and fly," Ryoga answered."Hey, you don't<br/>believe me!" he realized.<p>Nabiki was back with the water. She didn't wait for permission,<br/>immediately upending the contents on Ryoga's head. The boy<br/>disappeared, leaving only a pile of clothes with a little moving lump<br/>at the bottom. A minute later, a small pot bellied pig wormed it way<br/>from under the clothing.<p>"Well I'll be..." Nabiki sighed in suprise.<p>"Oh my, aren't you cute!" Kasumi swept the pig into her arms and began<br/>rocking it like a baby.<p>Akane started screaming.<p>****<p>With time to prepare, I arranged for the portal from PokeWorld to be<br/>vertical instead of horizontal. Falling face first in the dirt isn't<br/>my idea of fun. I had Demon and Slammer with my still unused Gyrados<br/>stored in pokeballs along with some supplies recommended by one of the<br/>Joy's that would help to care for the creatures. The other senshi<br/>made their own arrangements. Usagi, unwilling to give up any of her<br/>army, and I do mean that quite literally, had two duffel bags full of<br/>pokeballs. She's spent the entire night carefully labelling each ball<br/>and looked less than happy to be awake.<p>"No one's forgetting anything?" I asked. That would be great, having<br/>to jump back to retrieve a shoe or something, not that I would do it.<p>True to character, Usagi ran upstairs and came back down with another<br/>pokeball."Wouldn't want to forget Psyduck," she explained.<p>The mirror portal was open five minutes later and we stepped through<br/>into another dimension. This wasn't our home, either. That meant the<br/>last choice was the money shot. At least we didn't appear out of<br/>midair in the middle of traffic or anything.<p>****<p>I didn't notice anything unusual at first, busy as I was trying to<br/>feed Demon. It was when I reflexively attempted to draw energy to<br/>replenish that spent on flying. I got nothing. I could feel the<br/>power, I could even see it if I tried, but it would not obey my will.<br/>This is worse than it sounds.<p>"Girls," I roared, risking the use of some of my remaining power to<br/>make my voice audible to the spread out senshi,"don't use any magic!"<br/>Demon's huge expressive face began to look anxious so I returned him<br/>to his pokeball. Before going in search of the girls, I drew my<br/>Crystal from within my arm and pocketed it. I don't even want to<br/>imagine how painful having it within my arm would be when my power<br/>finally bled away.<p>I found Rei and Usagi, silently gathering them to me. The other three<br/>found us while we were looking for them. They all looked confused and<br/>a little afraid."I don't know what kind of shitball this world is, but<br/>it's got some seriously screwed up energy problems. Save all your<br/>energy for as long as possible, because you won't be able to get any<br/>more for a while." If only the Silver Imperium Crystal still worked<br/>with Usagi's magic, she could have kept us charged. As things now<br/>stood, even with the power of my Crystal backing me, I didn't have<br/>enough energy to key Usagi's crystal to my aura.<p>Usagi nodded."I thought something felt odd." Her brow furrowed in<br/>concentration."I can't draw any energy at all."<p>I had the others try and they all came up with similar results. We<br/>still had the pokemon if the natives got hostile, if there were<br/>natives. We, however, didn't have a way home. I wasn't going to<br/>mention that fact until later. Usagi obviously had the same thought I<br/>had. She started crying. Then I had to tell everyone why she was<br/>crying. My life blows ass.<p>****<p>No nice comfortable magical dome or cushion of air for us. Nope, just<br/>hard ground and hungry mosquitos. I used my chi to start a fire for<br/>warmth. Yeah, I still have that, for as much good as it does us. Ami<br/>beckoned to me. Eager to get away from the gloomey girls, I followed<br/>her until we were far enough away that even the occassional night<br/>breeze wouldn't blow any part of our conversation across the meadow we<br/>were camped out in back to the girls.<p>"Ranma, if magic doesn't work here, why is your ring still working?"<br/>Ami asked. I hadn't even thought of that!<p>I kicked in the mystical senses and scanned the little band of white<br/>metal around my finger. Damn. The minor enchantment that I still<br/>hadn't figured out, was nearly gone. If I had thought about it soon<br/>enough and deactivated the enchantment, there might have been enough<br/>power left in it for me to open a portal home big enough for me to<br/>squeeze through. I could have easily retrieved the girls then. Now,<br/>well now it was practically useless and I would be back to being a guy<br/>full time in a couple hours. Good thing the senshi couldn't attack<br/>me. Ah, all those damned pokemon. My life blows ass.<p>"It's almost dead," I replied."This ought to be interesting." I still<br/>had Demon in my pocket. If necessary, I could have him hold the girls<br/>off long enough to explain the whole fucked up situation.<p>I must have sounded pretty pitiful. Ami reached out and patted my<br/>hand reassuringly."Let's go back and I'll explain everything to them.<br/>They'll understand, I'm sure."<p>****<p>Ami and me walking back into camp holding hands(Ami's idea, I assure<br/>you) got the others' attention faster than if I had grown an extra<br/>head right there on the spot. That's not saying much with them in<br/>their present mood.<p>"This is very important, so pay attention," Ami said, looking<br/>pointedly at Usagi. The blonde girl stopped polishing the pokeball in<br/>her hand."Good. Everyone remember that man we fought the night before<br/>Setsuna arranged for Ranma to teach us magic?" They nodded. And Ami<br/>began to explain, all the while sitting a little ahead of me on the<br/>ground, protectively, I think. She finished a lot faster than I would<br/>have, but by using just the right words to get the point across.<p>I did my part then. Instead of changing the ring black, which would<br/>have used the remaining charge, I slid it off my finger. Their were a<br/>couple of gasps as I changed back into a guy. No pokemon battle<br/>orders, though. That was good."Hey," I said."It's still me, you know.<br/>Like Ami said, Luna just goofed up. It's not really her fault, her<br/>brain is a lot smaller than a person's afterall." I probably shouldn't<br/>have insulted Usagi's pet/advisor. Then again, why not? The cat<br/>'had' been at fault.<p>I was stared at for a few minutes, until Rei, of all people, said,"I<br/>always did think you were strange, even for a girl who had demons for<br/>friends. It makes sense now that I know you're a boy. No sefl<br/>respecting woman would scratch herself like you do."<p>Wow, I'd expected her to sic her rat on me at any time, not<br/>acknowledge me as something other than evil incarnate.<p>Usagi's eyes narrowed and she glanced from me to Ami and back<br/>again."So..you two..." She made a lewd gesture."Ah," and an airheaded<br/>smile of such magnitude to almost need sunblock in its prescense<br/>appeared."Ranma is the father!"<p>I felt like slapping myself. No, they weren't going to try to kill<br/>me, they were going to embarass me to death.<p>Ami looked at Usagi in utter confusion, then at me."Uh, Usagi, what on<br/>Earth are you talking about?" she eventually asked.<p>"But...I overheard you and Professor Oak talking about the baby and<br/>you said that you didn't know who thae father was...and...oops, I<br/>think I made a booboo." The meatball head hung her head in abject<br/>embarassment, her face crimson.<p>No one could even begin to appreciate the relief I was feeling at that<br/>moment. Ami actually laughed, a little forced, but a laugh<br/>nonetheless."The Professor and I were trying to figure out what<br/>combination of known or possibly undiscovered pokemon mated to spawn<br/>Demon."<p>****<p>With the flippers gone, Setsuna could finally walk properly again.<br/>Using the Time Gate no longer caused her agony since she didn't have<br/>hundreds of different energy patterns rampaging through her body.<br/>Ranma would pay. The rules banned her from contacting her future self<br/>for direct aid or information, but they didn't say anything about not<br/>travelling to the future herself.<p>First, before making the trip, she stopped by the drugstore and bought<br/>a tube of hemarhoid cream. The silver mists of the Gate parted before<br/>her and she used its magic to zoom in on Usagi's classroom. No Usagi.<br/>She checked all the others' classes too. Nothing. Something 'could'<br/>have interfered with the senshi and kept the busy, or Ranma could just<br/>as easily murdered them all and voided the pact. Well, Ranma would<br/>suffer for eternity at her hands if that were true. Homes and<br/>hangouts came next. Finally, desperately, Setsuna opened herself<br/>fully to the Gate's temporal magic and allowed her mind to be buffered<br/>by the Winds of Time while she searched for the senshi. Impossibly,<br/>that search turned up nothing also. If the senshi had died, they<br/>would have left remains, even if only a few scattered particles, but<br/>there was NOTHING. They had no future, not even one as worm food. If<br/>Setsuna had not had clear access to the past of each of the senshi,<br/>she could not have even been sure they had ever existed.<p>What had Ranma done to them?<p>****<p>I've always been a sorcerer first and a martial artsit second, but I'd<br/>still hazard to guess that not ten people on Earth could challenge me<br/>in straight physical combat. Chi is a major factor for the truly<br/>elite martial artists, and would have been for me if I had so much<br/>access to magic.<p>Early the morning after the revelation of my true identity, I awoke<br/>and began reaquanting myself with my chi. It was still there, like<br/>always, just not overly flexible due to inactivity. The simpler<br/>exercises taught to be by Happosai were a good way to get the energy<br/>pumping. I moved through those and to amazon attack augmentation,<br/>finally, when the girls were greeting the morning, my father's<br/>forbidden techniques. I'll say this for the old bastard, he wasn't a<br/>complete imbecile in his younger days. I'm glad mom gave me a copy of<br/>the scrolls that contained the techniques before the cancer got her.<br/>Bad memories.<p>"You said not to use our magic," Makoto accused a little suspiciously.<br/>The senshi were handling my true form much better than expected. If I<br/>had known they'd take it so well, I could have been a man a hell of a<br/>lot more than I had the past four months."Shouldn't you follow you're<br/>own rule?"<p>I didn't turn around to face her immediately, towelling myself off and<br/>putting my shirt on first."That wasn't magic," I answered with a<br/>smirk."I was using my chi. It's not as powerful or as versatile as my<br/>magic, it does replenishes itself, though."<p>"Like in the animes?" she asked.<p>I nodded."Mostly. I can't pull off anything like on Dragonball Z.<br/>I'm closer to Fist of the North Star levels in that respect, I'd say.<br/>I don't know how long we'll be stuck here without magic. If you want,<br/>I'll start training you to manipulate your chi. The process takes<br/>years, but it it's worth the effort."<p>"I'll try," Ami commented as she sat up and brushed the fur from<br/>Makoto's big dog off of her clothes. That little puppy had gotten<br/>something like ten times bigger when it evolved.<p>The martial arts lessons I'd been giving the senshi back on Earth had<br/>been meant to eventually lead up to some rudimentary chi training in<br/>order to give them the slightly expanded senses that make gathering<br/>energy for magic easier. Now, when they couldn't use their magic and<br/>pokemon can't always be relied upon, they'd be getting more than the<br/>basics.<p>"Tonight, after we stop and make camp, we can begin the breathing<br/>exercises. Today we should just try to ascertain where we are. And I<br/>need to feed Demon." Not to mention get us some food. The few<br/>supplies we had brought wouldn't last long.<p>Demon was eager to fill his truck sized stomach and decided that my<br/>walking speed was too slow. I fit in his hand comfortably enough. He<br/>was about to carry us into the forest when I stopped him. If he went<br/>crashing through, knocking down trees, there wouldn't be so much as a<br/>squirrel to be found.<p>I pointed up and said,"From the air, Demon, from the air." He nodded<br/>his understanding and with a great woosh of displaced air, we were<br/>aloft. The trees here were not closely spaced and the canopy was<br/>easily seen through. Gliding silently, Demon riding invisible thermal<br/>updrafts, I spotted a dear. Before I could signal Demon to pounce, my<br/>pokemon opened its maw and a thin jet of flame flew from between it's<br/>swordlike teeth and burned the dear's head cleanly off. The carcass<br/>had barely fallen to the ground when we landed. Demon sounded like a<br/>tree limb hitting the ground, not the ten ton monster he really was.<p>I'd been wondering when Demon would begin to manifest the fire and<br/>dark(whatever that meant) attack powers that Professor Oak's computer<br/>had predicted. I think that had been the flamethrower.<p>"You can go ahead and have this one, Demon. We can get one for us<br/>little humans later," I laughed. Demon was eyeing the surrounding<br/>trees hungrily, but he needed to eat meat to, not just wood fiber.<p>Demon shook his head and nudged the dear carcass with his left<br/>arm."Raaaaaannnn Maaaaaaagh." My mouth snapped shut audibly and I<br/>stared at Demon in shock. He grinned at me and tore a tree out of the<br/>ground. He had talked! Demon had talked to me! He'd said my name!<p>Demon had eaten half the tree and all of its leaves when I finally<br/>regained enough sense to dress the dear. It was a big beast and would<br/>feed us for days. Demon could have swallowed it in one gulp.<p>****<p>"Go on, Demon," I called to my pokemon. None of the girls believed me<br/>when I told them that Demon had said my name. I was about to prove<br/>them wrong."What's my name?" I asked, pointing to myself.<p>"Raaaaaannnn Maaaaaagh," Demon spoke, his voice a whisper compared to<br/>his normal full throated, earth shaking roar."Raaaaaannnn Maaaaaagh,"<br/>he repeated. I patted his flank affectionately. Hey, I never had a<br/>puppy when I was a kid, I'm just making up for lost time.<p>"Hahahahaha! Told ya!" Demon's much deeper, rock grating laugh echoed<br/>mine.<p>"How come my pokemon never talk to me?" Usagi asked."It's not fair!"<br/>And she started to cry.<p>Minako tried to comfort Usagi by saying,"I did hear about this talking<br/>Meowth when I was working at the pokemon center. You have one of<br/>those, don't you? You could teach it to talk."<p>Usagi wailed,"I traded my Meowth for a Bellsprout! Wah!"<p>I let Demon fly around a while so his trees could properly digest,<br/>then put him in his pokeball. Once Usagi was reasonably calm, we<br/>broke camp and went off in search of civilization and a means of<br/>returning home.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: I've had Ranma's personality changing slowly<br/>throughout the story, but I think it'll being pretty static from now<br/>on. I can't figure out what the world they are on should be and I<br/>need some help coming up with a reason why magic doesn't work. C&amp;C<br/>welcome at dark_<p>
