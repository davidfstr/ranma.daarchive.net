</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 17<p>I was still puzzling over Ms. Mizuno's unusual behavior, she hadn't<br/>even attacked me, when both my natural senses and those attuned to the<br/>renewed wards I'd placed in the apartment started shrieking. It's<br/>kinda like a loud siren that only I can hear, but has saved my life a<br/>couple dozen times. I jumped to my feet and had layered myself in<br/>barriers as strong as any diamond but as insubstantial as mist when<br/>the threat to my life appeared.<p>The large creature held a staff of some kind and was dressed in the<br/>parody of a Sailor Senshi uniform. Despite its appearance, the<br/>creature did have access to power, as evidenced by the temporal<br/>acceleration field that crackled on the end of the key shaped staff.<br/>Those are nasty pieces of work, capable of aging or unaging matter at<br/>something like a thousand times natural speed.<p>I activated three of the semi-sentient guardian spells that I'd put in<br/>place encase Setsuna ever decided to pay me an unfriendly visit.<br/>Around the creature, three fist-sized spheres of golden light<br/>appeared. They moved at extreme speed, something I could barely keep<br/>up with, and silently conferred with each other. When they agreed on<br/>which preprogrammed capture and elimination pattern to use, the<br/>spheres whirred around the still falling figure and before it could<br/>come within striking distance of me, they had wrapped it in a web of<br/>cohesive light, burning the creature and holding it immobile at the<br/>same time. I should teach that spell to the senshi, encase they're<br/>ever visited at home by their otherworldy enemies.<p>"Ranma!" it growled at me. Heh, it even sounded like Setsuna. I let<br/>the guardian spell lapse into simple balls of incandescent light,<br/>giving me a clearer view of the false senshi."I'll kill you!" it<br/>shouted, struggling wildly in its bonds. The smell of burning flesh<br/>wasn't going to do my carpet a bit of good.<p>Damn, now that I looked closer, the thing looked like Setsuna, too, in<br/>a horribly obese fashion. Oh, cool. Hehehehehehehehe!"Is that you<br/>Setsuna?" I asked. I know for a fact that I didn't curse her to be<br/>overweight, since that would have been an direct threat to her life<br/>and a violation of the pact."Shit, it really is you. What happened to<br/>you?" Setsuna used to be hot, but now, now she was...well she probably<br/>didn't weigh quite as much as me and all the senshi combined.<p>"I won't allow you to get away with this!" Setsuna exclaimed in<br/>fury."The senshi will break free of your control! They will destroy<br/>you!" I'd better get her out of that web, or she's going to start to<br/>cook soon. I really don't want to try getting fat drippings out of<br/>the upholstery.<p>I didn't use my own power, pulling directly from the Silver Imperium<br/>Crystal and amplifing the energy through my crystal, to set up a<br/>containment barrier as strong as I knew how to make. It should hold<br/>her, temporal abilities and all. My little guardians faded back into<br/>dormancy and I realesed the light web that had held Setsuna airborne.<br/>The milkily transparent energy bubble that appeared almost as soon as<br/>the web disappeared didn't allow the Senshi of Time(and pudding) a<br/>chance to move so much as a sausage like finger.<p>"What am I supposed to do with you, now?" I asked. She was beating<br/>against the barrier's side with her staff, to no effect. I couldn't<br/>even hear her screams of rage. Maybe if I accidentally let it roll<br/>out the window. Nah, better not. Oh well, it'll make a great<br/>conversation piece.<p>****<p>Ami's mom decided to drag her now very sexually active daughter to the<br/>drug store to pick up some condoms. She wasn't paying very much<br/>attention to her daughter's protests.<p>"But Mom," Ami whined desperately,"we use protection. Honestly, Ranma<br/>knows how to stop me from getting pregnant just by using a couple<br/>shiatsu pressure points." Kami-sama, this was embarassing.<p>"I don't want to hear it, Ami. Ranma seems like a very nice sorceror,<br/>and I'm sure he knows how to do all kinds of interesting things, but<br/>I'm not taking any chances with my daughter." Noriko was leading her<br/>daughter by the hand, a method unused since the girl had had to be<br/>dragged to the dentist when she was seven.<p>"That's not all, Mom. I know this magic spell that stops me from<br/>ovulating. If I'm not ovulating, I can't get pregnant, so don't you<br/>see, this is a waste of time. Please, I might see someone I know in<br/>there!" If Ami wasn't such a nice person, she would have blasted her<br/>mother. Unfortunately, Ami was nice, and the thought never really got<br/>past her subconscious mind.<p>Noriko looked at her daughter and snapped,"I want you to stop doing<br/>that immediately. Who knows what long term effects that could have?<br/>I want lots of grandchildren one day, and I won't have you sterilizing<br/>yourself by accident!"<p>Ami gave up, hanging her head in misery. She should have just kept<br/>her big mouth shut like Ranma had wanted and none of this would be<br/>happening. They reached the drug store and Ami was led straight to<br/>the contraceptives aisle.<p>"Now, just look around and see what kind you like and find the<br/>appropriate size. I suppose I should make an appointment at my<br/>gynecologist for you, too." Noriko sighed. She was happy for her<br/>daughter, truly happy, proud too, but why couldn't the girl have kept<br/>her mouth shut and not made her mother worry about all this crap.<p>Ami's face was bright red, and the color didn't show any sign of<br/>lightening. She scanned through the brands, sizes, and varieties as<br/>quickly as possible. Redder than ever, really closer to a bright<br/>purple, Ami asked,"Mom, are there any besides these?"<p>Noriko looked puzzled."Couldn't you find at least one kind that was<br/>okay?" Geeze, there were dozens of them."I've always liked the ones<br/>witht he little bumps on them, myself, but that's up to you."<p>Ami's eyes bulged."Mom!" she shrieked in a whisper. What had she done<br/>to deserve this?<p>Her mother patted her arm gently."Now that your all grown up, we can<br/>talk about things like that. So, what is it going to be?"<p>Ami looked the wall over again and said,"There aren't any that will<br/>fit Ranma." Noriko had to lean close to her daughter to hear the<br/>barely whispered words.<p>Now it was Noriko's turn to blush."Well, I've always heard that it's<br/>not the size that counts, but how you use it," she said awkwardly.<br/>Poor girl. Maybe they could stop by that sex shop down the<br/>street...No, it'd gotten blown up a couple days earlier.<p>Ami looked at her mother like she was crazy."No, Mom, all of these are<br/>too small." Ami just wanted to crawl into a hole and die.<p>Noriko's blush deepened. She reached out and pulled the largest size<br/>available from the wall."Certainly he isn't bigger..." Ami nodded. The<br/>silence stretched for almost a minute. Finally, Noriko said,"They<br/>'do' stretch quite a bit."<p>Ami nodded, now almost blue in the face."They don't stretch 'that'<br/>much," she told her mother.<p>Noriko replaced the package and said,"Ami, honey, walk to the end of<br/>the aisle then back again, okay?"<p>Ami shrugged. This was all just too weird. She walked to the end of<br/>the aisle, like her mother had asked, then returned. She couldn't<br/>help the confused expression she gave her mother on the way back.<p>Ami didn't appear to be bo-legged, and she wasn't limping noticeably.<br/>"You win, Ami. Just make sure to be extra careful with that spell."<p>Ami nodded in relief, feeling euphoric because of all the blood in her<br/>head.<p>****<p>Shampoo and Mousse, now both in human form, stood atop the high rise<br/>office building, surveying the open night sky that was brightly lit by<br/>the lights of Tokyo. Neither of them had ever imagined such a sight,<br/>and within their hearts, were sad that soon, all of this wonder would<br/>be gone, dead or destroyed by the Jusendo Alliance. Though neither<br/>one of them mentioned it to the other, they would each cherish the<br/>memory until their dying day.(enough sappy shit)<p>"If the Orb is correct, Ranma should be in that building somewhere,"<br/>Mousse said, breaking the long, drawn out silence that had grown<br/>between the pair. The Orb was literally pointing at Ranma with a<br/>glowing finger of light. No matter what direction they turned, it<br/>continued to point towards that building.<p>Shampoo nodded."Yes, but the Orb does not tell us where, and the<br/>structure is enormous. We could not possibly search for him without<br/>alerting the inhabitants. It would be far wiser to wait for him to<br/>come to us." The perch they had chosen looked directly down to the<br/>entrance of Ranma's home. He would have to leave eventually.<p>"I agree. I'll take first watch while you get some rest. I'll wake<br/>you in a few hours," replied Mousse. Shampoo agreed and went to where<br/>they had set up their bedrolls. Mousse had no intention of waking his<br/>beloved. She needed her sleep more than he did. He would watch over<br/>her in this foreign and wonderful city and make sure that no harm came<br/>to the young warrior woman.<p>****<p>I started to get a little tired a couple hours after catching Setsuna.<br/>I altered the barrier spell so that it would periodically refresh the<br/>enormous senshi's air and placed her in front of the wide screen tv<br/>she had so generously provided so many months earlier. I turned that<br/>tv to the raunchiest porno I could find, a really nasty one with a<br/>woman screwing dogs."Have fun," I told Setsuna.<p>I was about to step through the doorway into my room when an image of<br/>a beautiful silver-haired woman, dressed in a black body-suit/armor<br/>ensemble appeared in the air before me. It was an illusion, I knew,<br/>or the wards and my senses would have alerted me. If Ami and I hadn't<br/>been an item, I could easily see myself going after this one.<p>"That's not really much of a punishment for her," the illusion<br/>commented."When we were younger, she used to sneak off with father's<br/>hounds every chance she got." The woman grinned evilly and attempted<br/>to look over my shoulder at the imprisoned senshi.<p>"I'll go find something else, then. After I find out who you are?" If<br/>she was even remotely who her clues hinted at, Setsuna even had<br/>problems not pissing her family off. Hmm, maybe that's why the Senshi<br/>of Time doesn't get along with people very well. She's into dogs.<br/>Heh, I know a few canine demons I could introduce her to that she<br/>would just love.<p>"Katya Meiou, Sailor Pluto, Senshi of Space, and older sister of<br/>Setsuna Meiou. And you would be Ranma. Setsy has told me about you.<br/>Thankfully, for both of us, I like to make my own judgements about<br/>people." It was obvious who got all the manners, brains, and pretty<br/>much everything else worth having in this family.<p>"So, you don't plan on doing anything stupid, like trying to kill me?"<br/>I asked. If this Katya's power was actual Space manipulation like<br/>Setsuna's was Time, then I felt much safer around her. True, I can't<br/>create my own spatial pocket, and I'm still working on that<br/>teleportation spell, but as far as offensive and defensive uses of<br/>spatial manipulation, I'm much better than average.<p>Katya shook her head."No, I just came to ask for my sister. She's<br/>suffering from a bit of a psychotic episode, I fear, and I need to get<br/>her some treatment before the condition becomes permanent. Not that<br/>she is really worth the effort, but you wouldn't believe how tedious<br/>it is to find a replacement temporal mage. Just between you and me,<br/>the last time Setsuna had to take a century off, she was raising a<br/>litter of human/Plutonian hunting hound hybrid puppies."<p>I had to lean against the wall so I wouldn't fall over, so hard was I<br/>laughing. Oh wow, that was so, so good!"Are you serious?" I asked.<br/>Setsuna may be bad, but that last one seemed a little below even her<br/>standards.<p>Katya nodded."Oh yes, quite serious. It caused the biggest scandal<br/>throughout the kingdom. Pluto was even attacked by a militant animal<br/>rights organization. They said she had taken advantage of the<br/>hounds."<p>This was a Sailor Pluto I could get along with.<p>****<p>Along with thirty experienced Amazon warriors, Cologne journeyed to<br/>Jusekyou. No one in their right mind would fully trust Saffron, and<br/>the Amazons were making as many contingencies as they could. Today<br/>they would be gathering as much water from the more valuable pools as<br/>safely possible, especially the pools that gave extraordinary<br/>abilities to their victims. Some of the water would be boiled down<br/>and processed by the village sorceresses, creating the temporary<br/>curses, but much of it would be placed within sealed urns where it<br/>would not lose its potency.<p>Plans had been made to continue doing this right up until the end of<br/>the coming war. That way a sizable stockpile of the mystical water<br/>would be in Amazon hands in both South America and Africa encase they<br/>either needed it to help fight off attacks by the Musk or Phoenix<br/>People, or if they were denied further access to their home valley.<p>"I want double loads of the giant prehistoric sea turtle water." No<br/>one knew how a turtle the size of their main village had ever managed<br/>to drown in a pool large enough to hop across, but no one really cared<br/>either. They would change the marker to that spring and gather as<br/>much of it on each trip as possible. There would be no ocean<br/>tranportation more advanced than a sailboat once Saffron's artifact<br/>was activated, and the Amazons needed to be able to communicate<br/>quickly and efficiently between their promised continents when the<br/>time came.<p>As Cologne supervised the work effort, she mentally sought out the<br/>pool of drowned girl. This part of the plan was an absolute secret,<br/>but the elders had decided, quite unanimously, that they would be able<br/>to better lead their forces if they were in younger, more resilient<br/>bodies. Herb had already promised the use of the locking kettle,<br/>though he didn't know what the Amazons planned for it. It would be<br/>good to be young again. Maybe she could even get Ranma into the sack.<br/>Shampoo sure had enjoyed the experience.<p>When she found the pool in question, she formed a chi image of herself<br/>and left it in her place as she sprinted for the pool. She returned,<br/>a sack of cursed, or blessed water, depending on how you look at it,<br/>hidden within her robe before the image had even begun to fray.<p>****<p>That night, the combined Council of Elders for the entire Amazon<br/>nation threw a slumber party. They brought their favorite young men<br/>from the surrounding villages and had their way with them all night,<br/>repeatedly.<p>****<p>"There he is!" Shampoo exclaimed happily. She pointed over the side<br/>of the building. Mousse followed the gesture and sure enough, there<br/>was Ranma, walking out of the entrance to his apartment building.<p>Shampoo wasn't very happy with Mousse, it had been her duty to keep<br/>watch, too, but she gave him a little hug of gratitude nonetheless.<br/>She would have been asleep then if Mousse had obeyed her order.<p>"Hurry, Mousse," Shampoo said as she leapt over the side of the<br/>building. It was only about ten stories above the pavement, something<br/>she could possibly have handled without assistance, but using Ranma's<br/>sword to call up an undraft left that question unanswered. She slowly<br/>floated to the sidewalk, unseen by the few pedestrians in the street,<br/>and closely observed by Ranma.<p>Mousse settled to the ground beside her, a length of chain he had used<br/>as a repelling line disappearing back into his robes.<p>"Shampoo, Mousse, what are you two doing here?" Ranma asked in<br/>Japenase.<p>****<p>"Shampoo, Mousse, what are you two doing here?" I asked, grinning at<br/>the pair of Amazons. Shampoo had handled the sword with ease and<br/>skill. I'd sorta traded it to the Amazons for instruction in their<br/>advanced martial arts techniques. I'd gotten the better of the deal,<br/>in my opinion. What is one little enchanted sword when compared to<br/>the physical conditioning and chi focus I had gained in return? Not<br/>much.<p>Shampoo rushed forward and threw her arms around me, kissing me<br/>soundly on the mouth with lots of aggresive tongue action. When she<br/>pulled away, she said in her native dialect of Chinese,/I'm glad to<br/>see that you're well, Ranma./<p>Mousse stepped forward and extended his hand, I accepted it and the<br/>Amazon said,"It has been too long."<p>I exchanged greetings then asked,"Not that I'm not glad to see you<br/>two, but why are you here? A journey all the way from Jusendo is no<br/>small undertaking." I could already tell that something major was up.<br/>The Elders would never have let these two, the most promising young<br/>Amazon warriors in the entire tribe, travel all the way to Japan to<br/>see me unless the matter was urgent.<p>"Perhaps somewhere more private would be best," suggested Mousse.<br/>Once I'd fixed this guys eyes, he'd really gotten his head on<br/>straight. Of course I may have accidentally fixed that too. I've<br/>refined my healing spells a lot since then.<p>I led the Amazons back to my apartment. This was important. Katya<br/>could keep the senshi entertained for a while. Shit, how am I going<br/>to explain Shampoo to Ami? Sigh. I'll think of something.<p>Once they were seated, Shampoo said,/Ranma, we need you back home,<br/>badly./ My Chinese isn't bad, but it isn't anything special either.<p>I held up my hand and said,"Sorry, Shampoo, but could Mousse explain?<br/>If this is important, it'd be better for me to precisely understand<br/>the situation." She didn't look like she liked the idea, she was an<br/>Amazon female being told what to do by me, a guy.<p>"Ranma, Jusendo is about to go to war with the world. Lord Saffron, a<br/>living phoneix and leader of the Phoenix People, has negotiated an<br/>alliance between himself, Prince Herb of the Musk Dynasty, and the<br/>Council of Elders. He has in his possession a magical artifact that<br/>will render all modern technology and weaponry completely useless. We<br/>were sent to invite you to return to the village with us and to use<br/>your power to aide in the coming struggle. The main reason, though,<br/>is that the Elders fear that Saffron and the Musk will turn on us when<br/>the war is over. Your abilities as a sorceror would prove invaluable<br/>to the tribe, especially in crafting weapons of power for our warriors<br/>to use," Mousse finished, taking a deep breath.<p>What can you say when you've just been invited to participate first<br/>hand in World War III? The idea was appealling. Very, very<br/>appealling. With Demon and the other pokemon, maybe a few powerful<br/>demons, and the Sailor Senshi, we could pull the rug right out from<br/>under this Saffron guy. Yeah, that would be good, kinda like<br/>liberators of the world. That way Usagi could come into power as the<br/>new ruler of Earth, like Ami had said she was supposed to, with the<br/>public's consent.<p>"Saffron, you say he is an actual 'Phoenix'?" I asked to stall for<br/>time while I thought. Setsuna certainly wouldn't like it if the<br/>senshi and I took this little shortcut to global power, making all her<br/>plans for Crystal Tokyo useless. The world would be in absolute chaos<br/>if technology just stopped working, and I for one don't want to be on<br/>the losing side of a battle just as civilization slips back into the<br/>dark ages.<p>"Saffron is a Phoenix, like those of legend. I saw him working out<br/>once. He turned a large mountain into slag in less than a minute,"<br/>Mousse answered, his voice edged with fear. I nodded to that. This<br/>Saffron sounded like an overgrown fire elemental. Well, I could<br/>handle that easily enough.<p>I remained silent, sending urgent thoughts across my bond to Ami.<br/>With luck, she would pick them up and mention it to Katya. The<br/>spatial mage would be able to teleport the girls to my apartment and<br/>save me the trip to them and back. Once I was sure I had sent as<br/>strong a message as possible, I said,"I just invited some friends of<br/>mine, powerful sorceresses actually, to join us. They all have<br/>powerful friends themselves and I would rather they fight with us than<br/>against us."<p>Mousse nodded, realizing that I had all but agreed to join them, then<br/>translated to Shampoo what I had said encase she hadn't understood it<br/>all.<p>In my best Chinese, I said,/Shampoo, one of girls coming here my<br/>fiance. I love very much. You understand what happened between us<br/>was only one time thing?/ Shampoo nodded glumly./Cheer up. If they<br/>join us, Amazons be unstoppable./ That did seem to brighten the girl's<br/>mood a bit.<p>A few seconds later, a hole in space opened up in my ceiling and five<br/>senshi, all in full battle armor, along with Katya in her original<br/>uniform, floated to the floor. They were ready to fight, with energy<br/>blades drawn and fully primed spells ready. Ami in particular had a<br/>nasty one ready, a modified ice flame that burnt the heat from<br/>someone's body, leaving them as living statues of ice.<p>Before Shampoo or Mousse could get vaporized, I stood up and waved the<br/>senshi off."Sorry about that, guys. I didn't mean to worry you." They<br/>resheathed their swords and all the spells except for Ami's went dead.<br/>I looked at her and grinned and she, too, killed her spell."These are<br/>friends of mine. Mousse, Shampoo, meet the Sailor Senshi, my<br/>students."<p>The Amazons waved in a kind of numb shock.<p>Ami stomped over to me and began beating me over the head with a<br/>lamp."Don't you ever do that again unless your in major, major<br/>trouble, you hear me, mister!" she shouted."I was worried sick!" The<br/>power of guilt is considerable. Nervously, aware that I was being<br/>stared at angrily by lots of powerful sorceresses, I reached out and<br/>pulled Ami into a hug. She collapsed against me and started crying.<br/>Damnit, extreme guilt is even worse. I bent down and whispered all<br/>kinds of assurances and promises in her ear. Finally, when she was<br/>calm and merely clinging to me, I relaxed and began to rub my aching<br/>head. That lamp had been one of those new age, solid steel deals with<br/>the sharp edges.<p>Katya, trying to snap us out of an embarassing scene, asked,"Ranma, if<br/>you're not in trouble, why did you call so urgently?" Katya and I were<br/>going to get along really well.<p>I grinned lopsidedly at her and the senshi."Who wants to help take<br/>over the world?" I asked. 3...2...1...!<p>I wasn't disappointed."WHAT!" The exclamation came from all the<br/>senshi, including Ami who was pressed against my chest and Katya who I<br/>had thought was too grounded to react so strongly. Three of the<br/>windows in my apartment exploded.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: How will the senshi react to Ranma's question? Will<br/>Rei remember her pet fire elemental Saffy-chan from the Silver<br/>Millenium? Just what did Ranma promise Ami to get her calm? These<br/>questions may be answered in the next chapter, but they may not. Ah,<br/>screw it, yes, they will be answered. I'm not good at being<br/>suspenseful or dramatic so I shouldn't even try. This, with maybe one<br/>more chapter released later tonight will be the last of this fic for a<br/>few days while I go to visit my grandma before I go back to college.<br/>She's pretty cool, the only member of my family that isn't somehow<br/>disfunctional, and likes to give me money, so I don't really mind<br/>being cut off from the internet or cable to see her. C&amp;C me at<br/>dark_<p>
