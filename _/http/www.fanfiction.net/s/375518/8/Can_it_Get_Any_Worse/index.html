</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 7<p>The spaceship never actually touched down, hovering twenty feet above<br/>the tree line. As soon as the vessel was stationary, five short<br/>columns of sparkling blue and white light formed a haf dozen meters in<br/>front of us. The columns of energy each deposited a human being.<br/>Teleportation through technology, amazing. I was still working on my<br/>own teleportation spell using what I had seen of Setsuna's as a guide.<br/>It had a few bugs to work out.<p>What do you say to humans with a lot more technology than those from<br/>your own planet? The three men and two women from the ship didn't<br/>appear threatening and weren't armed with any kind of weapon that I<br/>knew up. Those things at their waists did hold a lot of energy,<br/>though. Here goes nothing."Hey, nice to meet ya," I said.<p>The man in the red jumpsuit stepped forward and cleared his<br/>throat."I'm Commander Riker of the Enterprise. This star system is in<br/>inmenent danger from a nearby black hole. Do you need assistance?"<p>Blackhole. That would not have been fun."We didn't come here by ship,<br/>Commander Riker," I replied. Now to see if they believe in magic<br/>here."My friends and I were transported from our home dimension by<br/>mistake when a containment spell I was performing went arry.<p>To my suprise the Commander just nodded and tapped a small device<br/>attached to his suit."Eleven to beam up, Ensign." Not bad, but the<br/>senshi's are better."You do wish to return to the ship with us,<br/>correct?"<p>Stupid question."Yeah." The girls behind me squeaked in fright when<br/>the teleporter grabbed them. I thought it felt pretty good, sorta<br/>like the bubbles in a hot tub. When the blue and white lights<br/>dissipated, the senshi, the Commander, and I were standing on a raised<br/>platform in a stereotypical futuristic space ship. All cool earthy<br/>colors and smooth, flowing lines.<p>"Welcome to the Starship Enterprise, ladies. You are currently being<br/>held within a containment field. As soon as you've been checked out<br/>in the sick bay and given clearance, Captain Picard will see you." I<br/>nodded and smirked at the senshi. They were a little overloaded at<br/>the moment. Too much input all at once.<p>A man in a yellow suit did something to the console in front of him<br/>and the teleporter dumped us in the sick bay. I could still feel the<br/>energy field around us and could have easily nullified it, but that<br/>would probably leave a bad impreesion with our hosts.<p>An attractive middle aged woman in a blue lab coat approached the<br/>field."Hello, I'm Dr. Crusher. If you all would just lay down on<br/>those examination tables, we'll be finished in a few minutes." I<br/>complied and the senshi followed my example. Whatever the doctor did,<br/>it didn't even take the predicted few minutes.<p>"All right," the doctor said, typing in a command on a touch sensitive<br/>flat panel. With the command the energy field surrounding us<br/>disappeared."You're all in perfect physical health. The Captain<br/>wishes to meet with you in his ready room and since I don't have<br/>anything better to do, I'll show you the way."<p>"Is this ship from Earth?" I asked after following the woman through a<br/>couple of corridors. I'd already seen a blue guy and a green woman.<br/>They weren't demonic in origin, so I guessed they were aliens.<p>"Yes," answered Dr. Crusher."Well it was built in one of the ship<br/>yards orbiting Earth. May I ask why you wish to know?"<p>"It's just unusual. The Earth we come from is way too primitive to<br/>possibly build something like this." Useful exchange of information.<p>"I was under the impression that you and your friends were involved in<br/>a reactor containment failure that somehow transported you to Berov<br/>IV." The doctor gave us all a confused glance.<p>"Heh heh. The Commander must have misunderstood." I don't really know<br/>what a reactor containment failure even is."I was working a<br/>containment spell, as in magic, to release the spirit of an ancient<br/>warlock without blowing up the countryside that held his tomb.<br/>Something went wrong and poof, here we are."<p>I got another confused and slightly skeptical glance. Squeezed into a<br/>tiny elevator, Ami finally spoke up."What does the ship use for<br/>propulsion? I didn't notice any exterior thrust apparatus."<p>The doctor laughed and said,"Engineering isn't exactly my area of<br/>expertise. As I understand it, though, the Enterprise uses a<br/>matter/anti-matter reactor to provide propulsion through particle<br/>drive or warp space manipulation."<p>For someone who doesn't know what she's talking about, Dr. Crusher<br/>sounded considerably knowledgable on the subject. Ami's eyes were<br/>shining with interest. Oh boy.<p>The elevator stopped and we stepped into what I assume was the bridge.<br/>There sure were a lot of controls and people and a really big tv<br/>screen."This way."<p>****<p>The Captain was an older man who was as bald as a cue ball. I<br/>repeated my story, this time in more detail, while the senshi gawked<br/>at a particularly ugly alien named Warf and a guy named Data who I'm<br/>absolutely sure wasn't alive.<p>"And your certain that you didn't somehow travel into the future with<br/>your...magic?" asked the Captain cautiously.<p>"Positive. For one thing, our future has her," I pointed to Usagi who<br/>smiled and waved to the Captain,"as Queen of Earth. I'm told that<br/>she'll grow into the role and I can tell that that hasn't happened or<br/>someone here would have recognized her. Mostly though, I just know<br/>that this isn't my universe of origin. The energy is off a little.<br/>Ami says that its a quantum variance or something like that."<p>"If I may," the woman named Diana interrupted,"Ranma is being truthful<br/>in this matter, or she has been so heavily programmed that she<br/>completely believes what she's saying." Sure hope she isn't psychic.<br/>All kinds of bad stuff could see the light of day.<p>"Yep, that's me, Ms. Honesty. Really, though. I appreciate you and<br/>your ship saving us from the black hole, and don't want to be<br/>ungrateful, but the sooner we get home the better. All I need is a<br/>mirror, some candles, and a few crystals, quartz if you have them."<p>"How would those items...Oh yes, magic. I'm sure they can be found.<br/>In the meantime, could you demonstrate to us your magic. We've<br/>encountered a number of powerful entities over the years who possessed<br/>powers that could have been ermed as magic."<p>****<p>Talk about hard to please, I had to eventually start blowing stuff up<br/>and flying around on the holodeck to convince the Captain that I<br/>wasn't just some kind of hoax. That holodeck place really kicked ass.<br/>I had Ami download the plans for one from the ship's computer once we<br/>were assigned quarters, not that I expected her to be able to build<br/>one with the junk back on our Earth. This is one hell of a space<br/>ship. It's big and luxourious and I wouldn't mind staying on a few<br/>years, but duty calls. Sigh.<p>Of all the advanced technology on this ship, I have to say that the<br/>food replicator is the best. Anything you want to eat with no more<br/>hassle than it takes to say a couple of words. Usagi did short her<br/>out for a couple hours with the ice cream addiction, but the guy with<br/>the freaky sunglasses fixed it up.<p>Speaking of Usagi, the girl was getting treated way better than she<br/>deserved. I shouldn't have mentioned that she was royalty.<p>We were invited by the Captain to see the destruction of the star<br/>system we had just left. The observation deck was full of ship staff<br/>and off duty workers who turned out for the spectacle. I didn't<br/>really care much for seeing what could have easily been my fate. I<br/>went along because the experience could be valuable. Ami had<br/>mentioned that black holes severely distorted time, and anything I<br/>could get together to fight off Setsuna, if the need arose, was worth<br/>looking into.<p>Ami squeezed her way through the crowd and managed to lean against me.<br/>She's a nice girl, and I like her as a friend, but I don't really want<br/>to get into a serious relationship with her. Casual sex and<br/>friendship is good, commitmitment is bad. I just hope she feels the<br/>same. For now, though, I didn't mind the few odd looks from the other<br/>senshi or the crew of the Enterprise. I was mostly accustommed to<br/>being female and I wasn't really a lesbian, so...Why not enjoy it?<p>She hugged me."Thank you so much for bringing us here, Ranma." For the<br/>last few days, when we hadn't been making woopy in my quarters, the<br/>girl had been sponging up knowledge from the computer at such a rate<br/>that Data, the Android(real fancy robot) that I thought was a dead guy<br/>at first, commented that among humans, he had never seen as fast a<br/>learner."When we get home I am going to be able to change the world."<p>Our little side trip to this alternate dimension could be the cause<br/>for the rise of Crystal Tokyo. With everything Ami has learned, she's<br/>assured me that she can end world hunger, stop pollution, fix the<br/>weather, and recolonize the solar system. The little minx is plenty<br/>grateful to me."No problem, not that I did it on purpose or anything."<p>She shrugged against me."It's the results that matter, not how they're<br/>arrived at." I hope Setsuna sees it that way or I may be making a<br/>return trip to the Enterprise.<p>****<p>"You're pretty tough," I admitted to Data. We were sparring in one of<br/>the holoecks. I was kicking his robotic ass. I hadn't had a purely<br/>physical fight like this in years, though, so I was enjoying myself<br/>immensely.<p>"Thank you." He leapt for me, using sheer mass to knock me off my<br/>feet. Whatever this guy is made of, it's a lot heavier than anything<br/>I've ever dealt with.<p>Once I had solid ground under me, I flexed my muscles and threw the<br/>android into the wall. I'll say one good thing for Happosai, he<br/>trained me well. I almost wish he hadn't tried to take over my<br/>younger body. Oh well, the past is the past.<p>"If I may ask," Data began, picking himself up and dusting his uniform<br/>off,"how is it that a human of your size is capable of withstanding<br/>the stress of direct combat with me? The only other lifeform of<br/>similar size to you that I have encountered were the Borg and they<br/>were highly augmented with cybernetics."<p>"It's all in the training," I answered."There's a certain peak that a<br/>person reaches where their body simply can not improve upon itself any<br/>longer, with the proper training, a that person can use their internal<br/>energies to strengthen their body. I've done it for so many years<br/>that I don't even have to use my chi to get it to work."<p>Data nodded."Chi being the spirit force of a living individual."<p>Data had duty in a few minutes and I had volunteered for some tests<br/>that the doctor wanted to run on my brain. They still didn't really<br/>believe that magic was real, as if the senshi's transforming without<br/>any visible energy source wasn't proof enough.<p>****<p>Within a week of searching, I had narrowed our home dimension down to<br/>three possibilities. These last three were so similar to each other<br/>in the most significant ways that I was having problems getting past<br/>this last hurdle.<p>The door to my quarters slid open without prompting and Ami threw<br/>herself off of me, forming a caccoon within the blacket and hiding<br/>inside. Captain Picard stepped into the room and sat in a chair near<br/>the door.<p>I tried not to glare too hard at the man. He'd done a lot to help the<br/>senshi and me, the least of which was solving a our lives. I'd been<br/>'this' close, though.<p>"I've just recieved orders from Starfleet Command. The Enterprise is<br/>to head to the nearest starbase immediately, with our newest guests<br/>under close guard, where you will be turned over to Starfleet<br/>Intelligence for debriefing. I won't assume to say that the<br/>experience would be pleasant. For now, I will be following these<br/>orders to the letter. I suggest you and your friends jump to another<br/>dimension as soon as possible. The replicators can provide you with<br/>whatever you need." And he stood just as quickly as he had sat and<br/>left the room.<p>Well, damn."You'd better download as much info as you can, Ami, while<br/>I gather up the others." She had already summoned her computer and was<br/>interfacing with the ship's systems.<p>I dressed quickly and went to wake my students. None of them were<br/>happy, but they forgot their desire to pound me when I passed the news<br/>on.<p>Usagi stared longingly at the replicator, tears gathering in her eyes.<br/>I didn't even want to know how much ice cream she had forced the poor<br/>machine to make her.<p>"I thought you still weren't sure where home was," Rei said.<p>"I'm not. There's only three choices. Thirty three percent chance of<br/>getting it on the first try. If it's not the right one, the odds keep<br/>going up until we hit the jackpot." Heh.<p>Ami was dressed and had backpacks for each of us. The Captain 'had'<br/>said we could use the replicators."Everyone grab one," she ordered.<p>****<p>I had been performing the location spell in an empty cargo bay. My<br/>quarters would do this time. The circular mirror surrounded by<br/>replicated(those machines are damned convenient) crystals stopped<br/>reflecting light as soon as my energy, augmented by my Crystal, began<br/>to pour through it. Each of the senshi held a colored candle<br/>represenative of her color. They lit them with a spark of magic, as<br/>directed by me, and the light generated by the flames was redirected<br/>staight into the crystals. A five point star formed above the mirror,<br/>it's corner the now glowing crystals.<p>I didn't really need the senshi to do what I had them doing. They<br/>felt useful and it eased the strain on me slightly. Win/win<br/>situation.<p>"Jump into the mirror," I told them. One by one, starting with Rei<br/>and ending with me, we jumped through the mirror and appeared in a<br/>lightly wooded area on the edge of a larger forest.<p>Damn, this wasn't the one. Ami and Rei looked at me. They, too,<br/>knew. I told the others and endured their disappointment.<p>"All we have to do is find another mirror and some more crystals and<br/>I'll try again. Chances are fifty fifty that it'll work next time."<p>****<p>There was definitely people on this planet, enough of them that I<br/>could eacily detect several of the larger populations. We were in the<br/>boonies and flying to save time. Minako suddenly dropped from my<br/>periphrial vision. I stopped sharply and glided down towards where<br/>she would have gone down if her spell had lost power. I found the<br/>girl sitting on the ground with an unusual looking little dog<br/>creature. It was barking happily and licking the girl's face like<br/>candy.<p>"Damn," Makoto hissed. First time I'd ever heard her use that<br/>particular word."It's a pokemon, a real live pokemon! Hey Minako,<br/>it's a Growlithe." She set down beside the blonde and between them<br/>they lavished an almost indecent amount of attention on the...pokemon.<p>"Oh my gosh!" Usagi exclaimed."Shingo has a stuffed pokemon just like<br/>that one!" And she joined the first two. That thing was seriously<br/>eating up the attention.<p>When I thought about it, I knew that it was theoretically possible for<br/>something like an anime to truly exist in another universe, but what<br/>were the odds of stumbling across such an occurrence? I asked Ami and<br/>she just shrugged.<p>"Are they dangerous?" I asked. I'd seen the commercials for the show<br/>a couple of times and some of those little creatures had real power.<br/>Neither Rei nor Ami, the only senshi not trying to mother the<br/>Growlithe to death, knew any more than I did about pokemon.<p>"I wish I had a pokeball," Makoto said. I think it's some kind of dog<br/>treat.<p>"You don't need one," Minako told her."This one has imprinted on you<br/>like normal puppies. He must have just hatched." That thing didn't<br/>look much like a bird, but who was I to say where little pokemon came<br/>from.<p>"I wish I had one." That innocent statement by Usagi totally halted<br/>any further progress for the day. Usagi and the other senshi, I just<br/>enjoyed myself watching Makoto try to teach hers to talk, searched the<br/>forest for more pokemon. The future Queen was attacked by giant<br/>birds, giant insects, and a walking tree. Despite these difficulties,<br/>she returned with a stupid looking lamb thing. Ami came back next.<br/>She had a giant butterfly resting on her right shoulder and a big egg<br/>covered with held under her left arm. She gave me the egg.<p>"Thanks," I told her with real gratitude. I have absolutely no idea<br/>what to do with a pokemon. I don't get gifts often enough to accept<br/>them casually."What do you think it'll be?"<p>"Minako says that there's no way to tell just by looking at the egg.<br/>I tried to scan it, it's so thick, though, that I couldn't get a<br/>reading." She was leaning against me with her butterfly sleeping in<br/>her lap when Minako finally came back. The girl led behind her a<br/>small parade of pokemon. Two different birds, one like Makoto's, one<br/>of Usagi's lambs and two giant caterpillars.<p>"Yes, yes, I know I'm good," she said and settled down on a cushion of<br/>air of her own creation, with her cadre gathered around her. I don't<br/>mind taking along a pet when we jumped again, there was no way we were<br/>going to have this zoo with us.<p>I was the only person awake at the makeshift campsite, pokemon<br/>included, when Rei stomped into the clearing. She didn't have a<br/>pokemon and didn't look too happy about it. The light given off by<br/>the last embers of our dying fire was enough for her to see the horde<br/>of pokemon collected by her friends. Then she saw me grinning at her.<br/>The girl turned around and stomped back into forest.<p>She didn't return again until midmorning and the squirming rat she<br/>held to tightly couldn't possibly have been a pokemon. Turns out that<br/>it actually is a pokemon. Is every animal on this planet a pokemon?<br/>That must really suck for people when wild animals with the power that<br/>Makoto said some of them had went on the rampage.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: A few chapters in PokemonLand might be fun. What<br/>should the next world be? I can't decide. I really need that lemon<br/>scene from last chapter. If you send me one and I use it you will get<br/>full credit. C&amp;C welcome at dark_<p>
