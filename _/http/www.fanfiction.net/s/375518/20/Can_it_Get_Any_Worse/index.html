</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 19<p>I don't know how they managed to pull it off, but somehow, the senshi<br/>convinced their parents, a large number of family members, and lots of<br/>friends along with their families. The Outer Senshi, all orphans, and<br/>not the most sociable of people didn't invite any friends, bringing<br/>the number of travellers up to two hundred and sixty seven. It's an<br/>absolute wonder that those government agent guys hadn't caught on to<br/>the little exodus. The senshi had even kept their identities secret.<br/>Good thing they're finally learning to do these things on their own.<p>The crowd milling around the Cherry Hill Park were beginning to get<br/>anxious. I think they were told that the war would be breaking out at<br/>any time. If Mousse's report was accurate, though, a little under a<br/>week remained until Saffron destroyed nearly a thousand years of<br/>civilization. A large truck, one of several that Ms. Mizuno had<br/>bringing in all kinds of medical supplies, pulled up onto the grass<br/>and Ami's mother stepped out of driver's cab. Where does a doctor<br/>learn to drive a big rig?<p>"Ranma, if this is some practical joke, I just want you to know that<br/>I'm going to skin you alive," Ms. Mizuno told me."Four missing<br/>shipments of medicine and medical supplies tend to upset people.<br/>Shouldn't we be leaving?" She's nice, in a take charge and bull your<br/>way through everything kind of way.<p>"If this is a joke, you're gonna have to stand in line to take your<br/>turn murdering me. All these people are getting restless and I can<br/>feel the fear radiating from them. It wouldn't take much to turn them<br/>into a lynch mob." If everything went to schedule, Katya, with<br/>assistance from me as a power source, would be making a mass-teleport<br/>to Shampoo's village in an hour.<p>Ms. Mizuno nodded and went to see about getting her stuff unloaded. I<br/>quickly 'ported back to my apartment to see how Ami was progressing<br/>with her computer."Well, how's it going?" I asked. She had found<br/>information on the likely artifact that Saffron planned to use. It<br/>was some kind alien egg modified both technologically and mystically<br/>to hold amazingly complex and highly specific spell patterns.<br/>Saffron's was a population control model, designed to limit the<br/>resistance that a planet would be able to offer if a conflict ever<br/>broke out.<p>"I've been able to find plans for a generator that derives a usable<br/>electric charge from raw magic and a type of view screen that utilizes<br/>water and refracted light over long distances. That's all in the<br/>database from the Silver Millenium that I can build with today's level<br/>of technical sophistication. The information from the Enterprise I<br/>downloaded may be able to be used to work out some rudimentary energy<br/>shields and a laser-like weapon called a phaser. I'd need to talk to<br/>Katya about helping me locate the parts for them, though, since most<br/>of the important components are in high security laboratories around<br/>the globe." Wow, and all I'd wanted was a way to get controllable<br/>electricity to power all of Ms. Mizuno's doctor crap. She'd bitched<br/>at me about using magic, so I'd turned to her daughter for help.<p>I shook my head."You always do so much," I said."Come on, we'll get<br/>you everything you need before the deadline." Ami flushed at the light<br/>praise. I grinned at her, and arm in arm, I 'ported us to the park,<br/>careful not to be seen by the crowd. Appearing before them out of<br/>mid-air would be a quick way to light a short fuse.<p>****<p>"Luna, I don't think this is very wise," cautioned Artemis. The two<br/>cats were creeping through the mists that led to the Gates of Time and<br/>Space.<p>"Quit being such a scaredy cat, Artemis," Luna hissed at her<br/>companion. "We have to find Sailor Pluto, the Time one, not that<br/>slutty sister of hers, and get rid of Ranma. He's going to ruin<br/>everything!" Luna could barely even bring herself to think about what<br/>her senshi were going to help accomplish. World domination. The<br/>phrase left a bad taste in the moon cat's mouth. She should have seen<br/>through that girl disguise. This was all her fault. She had to fix<br/>it.<p>"I know that, Luna," snapped Artemis."I'm not a total fool. I just<br/>don't think we should try to use the Gate. Neither one of us has the<br/>proper magic or expertise to do it, so why even try? What happens if<br/>we get sent into sapce, or back into a past where dinosaurs still<br/>lived? The mosquitos back then were bigger than we are now. The<br/>mosquitos! Think about the giant reptiles that could step on us!"<p>Luna smacked Artemis in the face with her tail and proceeded to ignore<br/>his babbling. She'd been around Usagi long enough to be able to<br/>completely blank her mind from such annoying chatter."How hard can it<br/>be? I'll figure it out and send you through to rescue Setsuna."<p>Artemis looked at Luna like she was insane."No," he said firmly."I am<br/>not going to let 'you' play with the controls and have 'me' end up<br/>with the consequences. You figure out how to work it and I'll send<br/>you through."<p>"Fine then, if you want to be such a pussy, I won't stop you."<p>****<p>"No," I repeated, not intending to do so again,"you can not take your<br/>car, Mrs. Tsuniko. I know that it was expensive and that you love it.<br/>I also know that it will be a useless scrap of metal in less than a<br/>week. Don't you have some furniture or family heirlooms you would<br/>rather take? Tools would be good. You should spend any money that<br/>you have saved up, too. It won't be good any longer than the car<br/>will." I didn't leave the woman any room to object.<p>People had sold property, liquidated assets, and cleaned out bank<br/>accounts, using the money to buy all kinds of things, from crates of<br/>toilet paper to truck loads of food. Every time I think about it, I<br/>can't figure out how the senshi managed to convince so many people to<br/>come with us. Oh well, with five minutes till departure, there wasn't<br/>time for anyone to back out and get their stuff back. I had<br/>reluctantly agreed to bring back anyone that changed their mind once<br/>we were in China. Then those that still had unfinished business<br/>wanted to come. Before I knew it, I had three short trips back to<br/>Japan scheduled in the next few days.<p>Usagi's mom walked over to where her family, sans Usagi, had made<br/>themselves comfortable. Mr. Tsuniko had taken my words to heart and<br/>purchased some high quality hand tools and lots of lumber. There was<br/>also a very large manually powered ice cream churn in their<br/>belongings. Usagi's influence, without a doubt.<p>Shingo, Usagi's little brother, was having a quiet conversation with<br/>the baby Charmander that the White Sorcerress had given him. Unless<br/>you looked closely, it would look like he was talking to a doll. I<br/>was already starting preliminary plans to begin teaming up the younger<br/>children with pokemon. That way, by the time they were old enough to<br/>fight, they would be able to go into battle with the powerful<br/>creatures.<p>I felt Katya's presence appear next to me suddenly and refrained from<br/>spinning around to confront her. Damnit, if someone saw her do that,<br/>we would have a riot on our hands."Don't worry, Ranma, I made sure no<br/>one was looking in this direction," she said.<p>"You ready?" I asked her. I was beginning to grasp the more intricate<br/>levels of the teleportation spell I'd picked up from the Space Senshi,<br/>but my control wasn't good enough that I would trust myself with so<br/>many people and material over such a long distance. Katya was going<br/>to be getting a lot of energy crammed into her for this, though, and I<br/>didn't want her to lose control either.<p>She shrugged."Sure. I've already scouted the area out. I'm just<br/>going to pull the whole park area out and replace it with a section of<br/>open ground near the east end of the village. That place isn't really<br/>a village, you know," she said, referring to the Amazon village."There<br/>are several thousand people staying there and it has grown noticeably<br/>since last week. It's more of a city."<p>The village never had been much of a village, but now with war<br/>preparations being made, I imagine the place would be swelling up<br/>pretty quickly. Good thing we were marking out our little piece<br/>early. "Wouldn't it be easier to just move the people and stuff?" I<br/>asked. I certainly wouldn't want to attempt to move that much matter.<p>Katya grinned at me."You just stick to your side of the job and I'll<br/>worry about mine. I've been manipulating space for thousands of<br/>years. With you to back me, I could probably move the moon." I don't<br/>want to think about what kind of trouble 'that' action would cause.<p>After a few placating gestures, I said,"Whatever. I'm gonna go make<br/>sure the senshi are in place." I was worried more about the Outer<br/>Senshi. Haruka was a belligerent bitch that needed her ass kicked,<br/>and I'm sure I'll be doing the honors sometime in the next few days.<br/>She would disobey orders meant for the safety of others just to<br/>aggravate me. Michiru and Hotaru were much too happy with me to be<br/>anything but perfectly agreeable.<p>Hotaru was a real suprise. Though her power was nowhere near what it<br/>had been when she had imprisoned Silence, for a mana-bound individual,<br/>the girl was extraordinary. When she fully matured, she would be<br/>nearly as strong as my senshi, and she hasn't got a bit of the Talent<br/>for magic in her. I'd also took the time and effort to study her<br/>glaive. It acted like a very weak version of my lens crystal,<br/>amplifying the senshi's power by about fifteen percent, but the main<br/>enchantment was something I suspect Katya was responsible for. The<br/>blade of the glaive encased slightly warped space, giving it a cutting<br/>edge that would shear through all but the most powerful of barrier<br/>spells. The girl would need proper training from the Amazons to use<br/>it effectively. She's young, she'll learn.<p>"Hey, Ranma!" Hotaru called to me, waving enthusiastically. She was<br/>already in her altered senshi state. I couldn't stand to leave the<br/>Outers looking like they did while my senshi looked so much cooler.<br/>No one seemed to realize that a senshi stood in their midst, assuming<br/>she was just a little girl dressed up like her favorite heroes.<p>"Hey, Hotaru. Do you remember what you're supposed to do?" Her and<br/>the other senshi would form a protective ring around the entire park<br/>once it was transported. They'd keep any overzealous Amazons from<br/>harming anyone while I explained the situation to the Elders. I<br/>probably should have done so earlier, but I didn't want to give them<br/>even the smallest chance to object. With nearly three hundred people<br/>on your door step, most of them loaded down with supplies and other<br/>useful items, it can be hard to turn them away.<p>"Uh huh," she said, nodding to emphasize her response."I'm supposed to<br/>keep any Amazons from hurting anyone here. I shouldn't kill anyone<br/>either, right?" Hotaru was of the same mindset as me on the subject of<br/>killing. If you've gotta do it, do it and don't regret it, but if it<br/>can be avoided, do that. An extreme view for a twelve year old kid, I<br/>know, yet a useful rule to live by.<p>"That's right," I answered."And try not to hurt any of the Amazons in<br/>a fight or they may try to kill you, no matter what." Oh...shit!"Um,<br/>gotta go, Hotaru. I'm counting on you." How could I have neglected<br/>that little fact. It would be just like Haruka to get a few score<br/>Amazons after her head.<p>****<p>Kasumi glanced up from washing the dishes as the overhead fluorescent<br/>lights in the kitchen momentarily flickered and dimmed."Oh my," she<br/>said to herself. Akane must be trying to hardwire her mechanical bull<br/>directly into the Nerima electrical grid again.<p>Kasumi was about to search out her youngest sister when Nabiki walked<br/>into the kitchen, She was wearing a pair of shades and had her purse<br/>slung negligently over her shoulder."Hey, Kasumi, I'm going to take a<br/>quick trip to the store to pick up a few cases of emergency batteries<br/>encase Akane screws the transformers up again. Are there any<br/>particular sizes that you need?"<p>Kasumi frowned in concentration."Well, a few of the twelve volts<br/>wouldn't hurt and we never did get the large car battery recharged for<br/>'Big Paul' after Akane's last power outage." She couldn't think of<br/>anything at first."You are going to get plenty of D cells?"<p>Nabiki nodded and looked at her sister like she was stupid."The<br/>charger is out in the tool shed. You should probably take care of<br/>'Big Paul' before Akane shorts out the entire district."<p>Akane hadn't been the same since Ryoga's unfortunate misplacement,<br/>none of them had, but the youngest Tendo had taken the absence of her<br/>playmate especially hard. The electric bill had more than trippled in<br/>the last two weeks. Nabiki was already whoring herself out to three<br/>of the richest men in Tokyo. If things kept up at their present rate,<br/>she would soon be working for a couple women too.<p>****<p>The sense of disorientation was stronger with this 'port. Must have<br/>something to do with the size of the load. I didn't wait for anyone<br/>to get themselves killed, taking to the air and heading straight for<br/>the Council building. Amazons were already beginning to notice the<br/>new Jusendo Park and the outcry soon went out for the warriors to<br/>assemble. News travels fast.<p>The 'village' had indeed grown. It had done more than grown. The<br/>Amazons now occupied about ten times more space than during my<br/>previous visit nearly three years earlier. The Council building<br/>hadn't moved, though, and I slipped through its wards easily, wards<br/>that I myself had placed to protect the building. No one had even<br/>looked up, so excited were the Amazons by the park appearing, so my<br/>arrival went unnoticed.<p>Heavy wooden doors swung open easily and I stepped into the single<br/>roomed building. Back against the far wall, a large, slightly<br/>concave, polished ebony wood table supported by three stone pedestals.<br/>Behind the table, where normally a dozen ancient Amazon women, and in<br/>time of trouble twice that many, were fifteen young women no younger<br/>than Ami and no older than me. Um, I don't know all the Amazon laws<br/>of etiquet, but I do know that these ladies would be in major trouble<br/>if they were caught in here.<p>Being such a kind gentleman, I cautioned,"If the Elders catch you in<br/>here, heads are going to roll." If they didn't understand Japanese<br/>that was their problem, at least I was taking the trouble to warn<br/>them.<p>"Has it been so long that you don't recognize me, Ranma?" the black-<br/>haired, attractive Amazon sitting in Cologne's Matriarchal position<br/>asked. There was a strong resembalance to Shampoo. Her Japanese was<br/>excellant. Cousin, maybe?<p>I shook my head. I don't think I slept with her, no, I know I didn't.<br/>There was only Shampoo and that Lotion chick."I'm afraid that you have<br/>me at a disadvantage..." I prompted. They were all grinning at me<br/>mischeviously. Sigh. Ami isn't going to like it here, I'm afraid,<br/>even if women are in charge.<p>"Why, Ranma, I'm your old friend Cologne," the girl demurred.<p>"Damnit, quit fooling around," I snapped."I need to speak with the<br/>Elders before some friends I brought with me start blasting Amazons<br/>into atoms." I hadn't heard any explosions or screams of pain, yet.<br/>The senshi were completely capable of killing silently, so you see,<br/>that wasn't much of a reassurance.<p>The girl claiming to be Cologne sat up straighter in her chair and her<br/>eyes narrowed."Ranma, what are you talking about?" she asked, her tone<br/>commanding.<p>Screw it. I walked over to the table and teleported, switching myself<br/>into the girl's place and setting her, chair and all, on the other<br/>side of the table. I ignored the gasps and looked at the black-haired<br/>girl. "Little girl, if any of my friends are hurt because you're<br/>trying to have some fun, there won't be enough of you left for the<br/>real Cologne to get her hands on." The other girls were trying to move<br/>now, trying but not succeeding. By force of will, I was holding them<br/>in their padded stone chairs. I had to increase the force, though, as<br/>they began applying impressive amounts of chi force. These weren't<br/>average Amazons, that's for sure.<p>Cologne-wannabe sighed and said,"I really am Cologne, you fool. These<br/>other ladies are the Coucil of Elders. We used the water from<br/>Jusenkyo to regain our youth in order to better lead our tribe in the<br/>coming war." That 'was' possible, but I knew that using Jusenkyo in<br/>such a way was terribly taboo for the Amazons. She sounded sincere.<br/>Not about to take any chances, I scanned the so-called Elders with chi<br/>and mystical senses. Oops.<p>When next I spoke it was from the original side of the table, with<br/>Cologne in her proper place and the other Elders not glued to their<br/>seat."Sorry. How was I supposed to know? By the way, Cologne, you're<br/>pretty hot." Dumb look."That means you're very attractive. Now that<br/>the formalities are over, get your unwrinkled ass out here and help me<br/>calm everyone down."<p>I didn't wait to see if I was followed. By the time the not so old<br/>Elders piled through the double doors of the Council building, I was<br/>hovering twenty feet in the air with my arms crossed. I said,"I hope<br/>you ladies can keep up with me." I could have levitated them with me.<br/>I didn't because I figured that the Elders should get to use the<br/>bodies they had traded in their old ones for.<p>****<p>Much to my suprise, not so much as a punch or fireball had been thrown<br/>in my absence. I found Shampoo, a broad smile plastered across her<br/>pretty face, introducing the senshi to her fellow warriors. The<br/>Elders had made good time and arrived, panting, less than a minute<br/>after me.<p>"It seems that your fears were unfounded," Cologne said. She was the<br/>only one of the Elders that showed no visible strain. All of them<br/>were used to bodies that required less energy and weren't properly<br/>managing their chi flows to enhance them. Cologne was the exception,<br/>not that I expected anything less from the ancient troll.<p>"Yeah, I guess." Better to be safe than sorry, or so the saying goes.<br/>People were wandering around the edges of the teleported park, clearly<br/>afraid to go much farther, but still curious about their new<br/>surroundings. Katya, bless her heart(that's just a saying, I don't<br/>give blessings), had volunteered to get the refugees situated<br/>properly. I never have been much of a people person.<p>"They are not fighters," Colonge said bluntly. After a pause she<br/>continued,"Oh, I see. Fellow sorceresses?" For someone with none of<br/>the Talent, Cologne was amazingly sensitive to it.<p>"Yep, my students actually. They're each class-bound, white, fire,<br/>air, etc...One of them is even the future ruler of the world." I was<br/>saving Ami for when the eventual attempted seduction came, as I knew<br/>it would.<p>Cologne looked at me blankly, a gesture copied by the other<br/>Elders."Oh, I didn't tell you?" They all shook their heads."Well, it<br/>goes like this. Saffron doesn't sound like the kind of guy I could be<br/>around without gutting, so I'm just gonna kill him when this is all<br/>over and put Princess Usagi on the throne as ruler of the world.<br/>She's a reincarnated princess from the Silver Millenium, that was a<br/>long time ago, and really easy to maniuplate, if you know how." Ice<br/>cream."Isn't that great?"<p>****<p>Author's Notes: I know I skipped a lot of stuff involved with getting<br/>everyone together, but I'm eager to get to the actual taking over of<br/>the world part of the story, and I'm sure you all are too, so don't<br/>get too uspet with this chapter. How should the Elders react to<br/>Ranma's little announcement? Better yet, how many of them will have<br/>to be eliminated to get the point across? Next chapter Cologne is<br/>gonna find out who the senshi are, too, and we might even see Saffron,<br/>not that I'm going to let him know about the senshi yet.<p>I want to have lots of supernatural resistance from around the world,<br/>but I don't know most of the good comics or animes that I could use<br/>characters from. I'd greatly appreciate suggestions for these people.<br/>Please include the series they're from, a short personality<br/>description, and a bio with powers listed and stuff. Like I did with<br/>Power and Responsibility(I really do plan on continuing that,<br/>eventually) I'll even accept original characters if they're good. It<br/>doesn't matter wether they're good or evil, demonic or angelic, just<br/>which side they fight on. Thanks!<p>Everyone who contributes stuff I use will get full credit for it.<p>Send them and C&amp;C to dark_<p>
