</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 20<p>One of the Elders turned out to be a low class sorceress. She chose<br/>to test her power against mine, despite the stupidity of the action.<br/>I didn't even bother to deflect the bolt of condensed air that she<br/>threw. The blurry sphere smashed against my shields, throwing up a<br/>small cloud of dust and tearing a few chunks of sod from the gournd.<p>"Don't get pissy," I told them, staring all the while at Cologne."I<br/>already know that Saffron will end up in charge at the end of the war.<br/>Your whole tribe will be better off with Usagi in power. She's<br/>compassionate, tolerant, caring, and all kinds of other things that<br/>the Phoenix isn't." I shrugged."And look at it like this, her kingdom<br/>will be a matriarchy," yeah right,"so women will hold most of the<br/>power. Amazons will be in much better positions than they would have<br/>if the Musk or Phoenix People remained in power." I sure thought I was<br/>making sense, but all the Elders except for Cologne were pulling up<br/>every ounce of chi or magic that they could.<p>"Perhaps we should discuss this with...this Usagi. Maybe she will see<br/>reason," Cologne said slowly. She was regretting sending Shampoo and<br/>Mousse to find me now. She just doesn't know how lucky she is. If<br/>the Amazons along with the others from Jusendo had attacked us, the<br/>senshi and I, our pokemon included, would have laid down some unholy<br/>asskicking on them.<p>I waved that suggestion aside."Don't bother. She's just a child.<br/>Think of me as her business manager. I make the decisions and she<br/>sits there and looks pretty. In a few decades, maybe things will<br/>change. She 'is' a direct descendent of Kami-same." Like the great-to<br/>the twentieth power-granddaughter. Still, that does qualify as blood<br/>relation, if barely.<p>"Why the nerve of this 'boy'," a small red-headed Elder with big tits<br/>spat."You don't know who you're dealing with." She was almost ready to<br/>spit nails. Heh. I grinned at her, illuminating my eyes and making<br/>them glow with green and golden fire.<p>"Maybe you don't understand what I'm saying," I drawled."I'm not<br/>taking charge of the tribe. You ladies can make all the decisions.<br/>When the war is over and done, that is when you're gonna sit back and<br/>let us take over. And don't even think about double crossing me.<br/>Usagi has an army of extra-dimensional animals that even I would have<br/>trouble dealing with. If something were to happen to her, well there<br/>would probably be a few Amazons left after they got through with you.<br/>Cooperate and that army, along with all our magic will be turned<br/>towards saving Amazon lives. Otherwise, as much as I'd hate to do it,<br/>I'll just kill you all and start the takeover now." If I were female<br/>then they would probably be able to swallow this much easier. Hey,<br/>that's a good idea. Good me.<p>I still wore the black ring given to me by Setsuna. I liked the way<br/>it looked, so sue me. It had recharged itself over time. I repeated<br/>the simple mental cantrip that would change the metal of the ring<br/>white and the change overtook me. I became, Ranma Saotome, mega-babe.<br/>The Elders gasped, gawked, or did a combination of the two. Except<br/>for Cologne. She's a steady one, that's for sure.<p>"Now that I've revealed my true form, does anyone feel more like<br/>cooperating?" Cologne probably wouldn't buy this, but by now she had<br/>to have seen that there was no reason to resist my course of action.<br/>It would benefit the Amazons in every way.<p>The green-haired sorcerress wannabe whispered,"That is not the magic<br/>of Jusenkyo at work." No shit, ya dumb bitch. Did anyone else not see<br/>a large amount of cold water fall on me?<p>"Ranma, if that is your real name, why did you first visit our tribe<br/>as a man?" Cologne asked. I'm gonna have to make her something<br/>special for going along with me."You must have known that you would be<br/>better treated as a woman."<p>"It's fun to pretend to be a man every so often. Most of the rest of<br/>the world gives them more respect and power," I said mischeviously,<br/>like I'd played a joke on someone."You girls wouldn't believe what<br/>guys talk about when they're alone." That comment got some knowing<br/>looks and a few sets of raised eyebrows.<p>"And your...fling with my great-granddaughter?" pressed Cologne.<br/>Maybe she had been taken in too.<p>"I like women. As a man that looks like my male form, it's not too<br/>hard to find willing women. Can you blame Shampoo, I do have a nice<br/>ass. Don't you think?" This is fun!<p>****<p>By the time we'd walked back to the Council building, I'd pretty much<br/>convinced the old coots that I was the real deal. One of the elders<br/>though, the one who didn't like 'boys' kept checking out my rack.<br/>That was going to need some attention or Ami was likely to use the<br/>brain freeze spell on someone, possibly me.<p>"Sure, since the senshi are all female, males aren't likely to get too<br/>far ahead in the future." I probably should have gone to the Musk with<br/>my offer. They respect women more than Amazons respect men.<p>All the Elders exchanged odd glances after that comment. I let my<br/>senses range over them. They'd suddenly began to feel a small bit of<br/>fear. Why would that load of bull about men being second class<br/>citizens bother 'this' group of dikes?<p>"Senshi? Do you refer to soldiers or 'Sailor Senshi'?" Cologne asked<br/>evenly. Her voice was tight, tension actually coming to the surface<br/>of her mind.<p>Something that I didn't understand was going on here."The Sailor<br/>Senshi. My students. What's the big deal?" I'm not truly empathic,<br/>having to combine my higher senses with magic to sense true emotions,<br/>but I could nearly smell the surge of fear and anger that the Elders<br/>released before they could control themselves.<p>"Ranma, Saffron has spoken in great detail about the Sailor Senshi,<br/>his captors during the ancient times before even Jusenkyo existed.<br/>None of us believe that any other woman could come close to acting the<br/>way he has said, but his hate borders on the insane." Cologne was a<br/>virtual fount of knowledge. So Saffron came from the Silver<br/>Millenium. That would bear definite looking into."If he were to<br/>discover the senshi here..." she left the statement hanging,<br/>attempting to convey danger, I think.<p>"So? The senshi don't look anything like they did in their former<br/>incarnations. I've even changed their armor. As long as none of your<br/>Amazons starts flapping their jaws, he won't ever find out, at least<br/>not until I'm ready for him to." If Saffron caused this much worry,<br/>his power must be considerable. A fire-kami, not just an elemental?<br/>Maybe, maybe not. If he was as powerful as everyone seems to think,<br/>he wouldn't need the Amazons or Musk. I'll deal with him when the<br/>need arises. To assuage the Amazon's fears, I said,"Don't worry. I<br/>can handle Saffron. My pet dragon could probably handle Saffron."<br/>Gyrados was reasonably strong with ice and water, the elemental<br/>opposites of fire.<p>Mentioning Gyrados quickly changed the topic of discussion. A few<br/>more assurances that Saffron wouldn't come streaking out of the sky<br/>without warning and turning the village into a pit of lava and we were<br/>talking about pokemon."We got lost in another dimension and the place<br/>turned out to be crawling with the things. People keep them as pets<br/>mostly, but their power can grow to be quite formidable." They weren't<br/>quite ready for Demon. Slammer, yes, he would work nicely.<p>"Where are these pokemon?" another busty Elder asked. Ami had already<br/>confirmed that the pokeballs would work even after Saffron's<br/>technology suppressor went active. There would have been a whole<br/>bunch of pokemon to feed and shelter otherwise.<p>I pulled Slammer's pokeball from a rudimentary spatial pocket(yes, I<br/>was finally developing my own). The pocket was small, barely large<br/>enough to hold my three pokeballs and a handful of weapons I thought<br/>may prove useful in the near future. It was growing, though, and<br/>would reach a size comparable to the senshis', or so Katya told<br/>me."They're kept in these devices. They work kinda like Mousse's<br/>Hidden Weapons technique, warping space inside to make much larger<br/>objects fit."<p>Cologne nodded, as if she had expected nothing less."Would a<br/>demonstration be too much trouble?" I had been about to offer just<br/>that.<p>****<p>The bakusai tenketsu training field seemed like the best place to turn<br/>Slammer loose for a little demonstrative mayhem. We didn't need for<br/>anyone to see the pokemon and have a fit about demons."Go Slammer!" I<br/>called, activating the pokeball. Slammer materialized from the<br/>crimson light, a ton of diamond hard living stone.<p>"Gooooooooo Leeeeeeemmmmmmmm!" Slammer roared, pounding the ground<br/>with his fists, shivering the stone beneath our feet. He and I had<br/>worked that out as a sort of battle cry last week. He always had<br/>liked to show off whenever he got the chance.<p>"As you can see, Slammer is most...impressive. His animate nature<br/>negates the bakusai kentetsu and he gives off no heat, so a renegade<br/>Amazon would have more than her share of trouble harming him." They<br/>had to know I was emphasizing just how powerless they were. As I said<br/>before, being female was making this much easier. The Elders would<br/>probably have been much more distrustful of me in less stressful<br/>times, but they were so desperate to see reality the way they wanted<br/>it(this being not having a man in charge) that they'd practically<br/>ignored my blatant manipulation.<p>"What exactly is this pokemon capable of?" I wonder. What do giant<br/>rock creatures do?<p>"Slammer, smash stuff," I commanded, grinning at him. I think the<br/>pokemon winked at me, but I can't say for certain. The next few<br/>minutes involved Slammer picking up huge boulders and smashing them,<br/>throwing them , and exploding them into various sized pieces of<br/>rubble.<p>"Just think how useful he'll be in urban warfare," I commented as<br/>Slammer was digging a tunnel."Slammer can just shake the city to<br/>pieces and none of your warriors ever get hurt." I felt like a<br/>salesman, and in a way I was, a salesman selling himself(herself,<br/>whatever) as head honcho.<p>While the Elders had a little pow wow to draw out the length of their<br/>total autonomy, Cologne walked over to me."I commend you, Ranma. You<br/>come across a little strong as a woman, but they bought it, hook,<br/>line, and sinker."<p>"You Amazons have such a hard time seeing that men are your equals<br/>that I decided to bipass the whole problem. Besides, you know it as<br/>much as I do that my plan and prescence will benefit everyone, not<br/>including Saffron." Stupid old women, making me become a chick again.<br/>Ami would be getting her Ranko back, at least. For your own health,<br/>just forget that I ever mentioned that.<p>"For a man," Cologne grinned, making herself look even more like<br/>Shampoo,"you have an amazing grasp of the overall situation. Now, how<br/>do your other pokemon compare to Slammer and the enhancing curses of<br/>Jusenkyo?" Down to business, again.<p>I thought that question over for a minute before answering."That<br/>chimera one, the yeti-riding the whatever thing, could probably take<br/>out some of the weaker ones that the senshi have, but most of the<br/>pokemon have powerful projectile attacks that would take it out before<br/>it got close enough to use its physical strength. Mine would<br/>dessimate it. The Ashuru curse is very powerful, but that one changes<br/>personality too much to be useful. I'd say that it could, one on one,<br/>defeat all but the girls' strongest pokemon. Once again, mine would<br/>win." What can I say, I have good taste in pets. The only other<br/>halfway beneficial curse I knew was the elf curse. I didn't mention<br/>it, though, as I knew Cologne wouldn't even consider allowing anyone<br/>to use it. That particular curse turned its victim into a psychotic<br/>elven death mage that I would have had major trouble defeating before<br/>aquiring the crystals. As a matter of fact, I had had to defeat that<br/>damned elf when some little old chinese man had fallen into it during<br/>my last stay in the village. That's the kind of coincidence that I<br/>really hate.<p>"There are a few others, but none as powerful in combat as those you<br/>mentioned. Do these pokemon breed?" she asked. Already looking for a<br/>way to get your greedy little paws on the pokemon, eh?<p>"Yeah, they lay eggs occassionally. Ami and Usagi have worked out a<br/>breeding program that will keep the pokemon at controllable levels."<br/>Usagi was only allowed to have pokemon of the opposing sexes capable<br/>of breeding out when we were fighting or needed particular eggs."For<br/>now, those eggs will be going to the people that came with us from<br/>Japan. Eventually we may begin introducing them to Amazon warriors.<br/>The fighting type pokemon will be of particular interest to you and<br/>your people, I believe." Cologne wasn't happy with the pokemon being<br/>held just out of her grasp. She covered it up well enough that only<br/>someone as sensitive as me could have felt the emotion, though, and we<br/>continued to discuss the important matters of the next few days.<p>****<p>"I'm home!" Nabiki announced, stepping into the house and dragging a<br/>suprise behind her. The lights weren't flickering any longer, which<br/>meant that either Akane had electrocuted herself or succeeded. Kami-<br/>same knew she wouldn't have just given up."I've got a suprise!"<p>Kasumi came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a small towel, her<br/>face flushed and her brow slick with sweat. Akane, equally<br/>bedraggled, followed behind the eldest Tendo."Oh, hello Tatewaki,"<br/>Kasumi greeted.<br/>"What brings you here today?"<p>Kuno's brow furrowed in immense concentration, finally he gave up and<br/>said,"I haven't a clue."<p>"Nabiki," Akane growled,"you're not serious are you?"<p>Nabiki shrugged."Why not? He's got the necessary equipment, and lacks<br/>the intelligence of a rock. He may not be up to Ryoga's standards,<br/>but we can make due with him for now."<p>Kuno looked from Akane to Nabiki and back again,"What speaketh thee,<br/>my love?" he asked, puzzlement overriding the usual urge to shower<br/>Akane Tendo in love.<p>"Nothing," Akane snapped at the boy."But it's 'Kuno'?" persisted<br/>Akane.<p>"Well if you don't want him...I suppose Kasumi and I can share him.<br/>Is that okay with you big sister?" Kasumi nodded.<p>Tatewaki was such a nice young man, volunterring to take care of their<br/>womanly needs. She would make sure to make his first experience with<br/>her especially memorable."Oh yes, of course."<p>Nabiki looked at Akane."It would be your turn first, you know?"<p>Akane was obviously torn between revulsion of Kuno and the almost<br/>uncontrollable urge to screw anything that walked, man, woman, or<br/>beast. If only their father hadn't run away, she wouldn't have to<br/>stoop to 'Kuno'. She shuddered, but said,"Okay, you win. Go strap<br/>him in and I'll get ready."<p>Nabiki, as last to use Ryoga, was responsible for readying their toy<br/>for its next use."Come along, Kuno, I have a suprise for you."<p>Kuno scratched the back of his head in confusion."Perchance, none of<br/>you lovely ladies has partaken of the twisted fruits of my dear<br/>sister's labor, have thee?"<p>"Don't talk, Kuno," Nabiki ordered.<p>****<p>As Tatewaki leaned against the wall Nabiki had chained him to, he<br/>attempted to piece together the puzzle presented to him by the unusual<br/>behavior displayed by his love and her sisters. Was there a gas leak<br/>nearby? That must be it. Why else would Nabiki chain him to a wall<br/>and force him to where a rubber body suit? He would have to arrange<br/>for Sasuki to fix the faulty pipe just as soon as he was released.<p>The door opened, temporarily lighting the dark room and showing a<br/>backlit figure who's features Tatewaki couldn't make out. The figure<br/>reached over to the wall and switched on a set of dim red light.<p>Tateaki nearly suffered a massive coronary at the sight of Akane, his<br/>love, wearing a tight leather corset, her breasts spilling over its<br/>top. In her left hand the girl held a stiff riding crop and in the<br/>other a coiled bull whip.<p>****<p>"!" Tatewaki bellowed."Someone, save<br/>!"<p>****<br/>My old hut had been refurbished after the decision to bring me into<br/>the Alliance was made. Ami and I were due a little quality time<br/>together since we'd been working our asses off getting crap togehter<br/>and making sure no one screwed up and got us all in trouble, and we'd<br/>just finished taking advantage of some of that time.<p>I was female, the ring has its advantages, as I may have previously<br/>mentioned, and it doesn't take nearly as much work to get off lots of<br/>times as a girl. Ami's head rested against one of my bare breasts and<br/>I was starting to get randy again, but I'd wore the poor girl out.<br/>I'd have to wait a few minutes, at least.<p>"Mom tried to make me stay in the tent with her," Ami was saying, her<br/>breath teasing my nipple. Those things are much too sensitive."All I<br/>had to do was mention how much inventory she had to take with all the<br/>stuff she stole from the hospital and she forgot about me completely."<br/>She laughed. Ami, devious? Real turn on, that.<p>****<p>Warm, contented sleep. I don't experience it often, not often enough<br/>to take it for gratned. With Ami snuggled against me, I was sleeping<br/>soundly. That changed when all four wall of my hut exploded, sheered<br/>away by a powerful chi blast. My mind, fuzzed by sleep and sex,<br/>didn't immediately grasp the situation. Reflexes, developed over<br/>years of constant danger, did prompt me to raise a semi-decent body<br/>shield.<p>Objects, enchanted objects, bounced off this shield almost before I<br/>could form it. Figures, at least a dozen, formed a ring around the<br/>remains of my hut. They were swathed in baggy black clothing, all but<br/>hiding their identity. All female.<p>When you're suprised, and, yes, a little afraid, you don't act as you<br/>would in more controlled conditions. Three of the women exploded into<br/>clouds of gorey mist as I encased them in bubble of true vaccum space.<br/>They didn't even get a chance to scream. Power, from my own reserves,<br/>from the surrounding environment, and energy from the Silver Imperium<br/>Crystal flooded through me, in turn passing through my lens and<br/>gaining in strength by a factor of ten.<p>I spared a moment to glance at my love. From her arm and chest,<br/>shuriken, each dark stained and glowing malevolently, protruded. She<br/>didn't move, her life force barely remained within her body. It was<br/>fading. My Ami was dying.<p>I had to save Ami. She was all that mattered. Instantly the energy<br/>that throbbed within me extended, wrapping my fiance in a web of solid<br/>energy, cutting her off from time, removing her from existance. The<br/>All Mighty could not take her if he couldn't reach her. A handful of<br/>seconds had passed. The Amazons were closing in, weapons, all holding<br/>enchantments of some kind, drawn. The element of suprise was lost to<br/>my attackers, those who had harmed Ami, now that my perceptions had<br/>been thrown into overdrive with the step-up in power and cold rage<br/>that consumed me.<p>Knowledge of the Infernal Gateways, combined with my recently learned<br/>teleportation spell, came together in my mind and a thought later a<br/>doorway stood open before me, a doorway to Hell. Demons raved and<br/>tortured souls cried out in unending agony. I ignored the piteous<br/>screaming. The nine remaining Amazons, now all nearly within striking<br/>distance, froze, first in fear of the vision that was all too real,<br/>and then as I took away control of their bodies.<p>"ARISE!" I commanded, my voice booming, the air around me humming with<br/>crackling energy waiting for release. I gave the energy its freedom,<br/>using it to increase the power of my demonic prescence a hundredfold.<br/>"COME TO ME!" They had no choice but to obey.<p>They came, a horde of ravening, soul-starved beasts. A thousand<br/>demons attempted to pile through the tear in reality. I only allowed<br/>the strongest, the most sadistic to cross. The price of the Hellborn<br/>is high. Someone was going to pay.<p>****<p>The explosion woke the lighter sleepers. The cries of the damned got<br/>to the more firmly entrenched. My command raised the dead. It was<br/>the continuous scream of nine Amazons being tortured and repeatedly<br/>raped by the denizens of Hell while the sky burned with black fire<br/>that brought me my audience, though.<p>Many who saw the demons at work became violently ill, others lost<br/>consciousness, and some watched in sick fascination. No one had the<br/>nerve to approach me or my minions.<p>As my captured Amazons neared death, I returned the spark of life to<br/>their bodies and healed their wounds. Dawn approached, the torment<br/>continued. The sun rose and the sky barely lightened, obscured as it<br/>was by the Death Flame. The flame would soon leave this world,<br/>though, its job completed as each tortured Amazon's soul twisted,<br/>became a thing barely resembling its former self.<p>They would live. They would also be absolutely insane. Karma? If<br/>their soul ever escaped Hell, pond scum would be above their place in<br/>existance.<p>Even demons can be sated, and when a demon feeds off pain and<br/>suffering, it gains most greatly from inflicting pain itself. My<br/>demons reached their fill almost exactly as the death spell that hung<br/>in the sky departed. Nine Amazons, nine Elders, each a mass of poorly<br/>healed scars and neverending anguish, remained twitching upon the<br/>ground.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: I was going to handle that last part differently, but<br/>I drank a little too much last night and my buzz was strong enough to<br/>mess me up a little(I don't drink to the point of being drunk, I do<br/>stupid things that I can't remember if I do). After rereading it this<br/>morning, and fixing a lot of spelling and grammar errors, I decided to<br/>leave it how it was. Offer still stands for character submissions.<br/>I've already gotten a few really good ones, but most of them don't<br/>really describe the character, original or from some other series,<br/>well enough for me to decide what to do with them. That last scene<br/>was a bit dark, wasn't it? I normally don't do that. I think I may<br/>start, though. It's fun. C&amp;C me at dark_<p>
