</div><br/>Can It Get Any Worse?: Chapter 2<p>I didn't exactly burst through the door to my apartment, but I did<br/>enter with full powers active and senses at their peak. I wasn't<br/>really worried. Probably some demon or another stopping by to pay me<br/>a visit. Yep, two demons actually.<p>"Ranma," one of them said politely,"would you like to share our meal?"<br/>He, at least I think it was a 'he', never can tell with those chaos<br/>demons though, lifted the remains of a human heart. I was about to<br/>zap someone when I noticed they had laid a tarp out so that none of<br/>the blood got on my carpet.<p>"Uh, no thanks. Not into cannabilism. So what brings you by the<br/>neighborhood? Oh, and by the way, who are you?" I had mostly relaxed,<br/>keeping only a trace of power with me just encase someone decided to<br/>crash the little party.<p>"Don't tell me you don't recognize your old pal Phil?" he asked<br/>feigning hurt feelings.<p>"Ah, Phil, what happened to the scar?" I never meant to cut his head<br/>in half, eight year olds tend to over react when the boogey man crawls<br/>out from under their bed.<p>Phil reached across the bloody tarp and patted the other chaos demon<br/>lovingly on he bare, boil covered scalp. Now that I looked closely, I<br/>could see a slight set of breast on the other one. Wow, that's like<br/>finding a human woman with basketball sized implants.<p>"Cindy here is an excellant demonic healer," Phil cooed. Demons<br/>getting sappy, what was the world coming to? Nevermind, stupid<br/>question.<p>"Hi Cindy, nice to meet you." I threw myself onto the giant sofa and<br/>flipped the tv on."Not to sound like an ungrateful host, but what are<br/>you two doing here? Tokyo is pretty much the devil hunter capital of<br/>the world."<p>"That's why we're here," Phil sounded scared, probably for<br/>Cindy."We've been attacked by three different sets of them. I think<br/>the last ones were the Sailor Senshi, but they were different than<br/>what the stories say."<p>I grinned sheepishly."That's my fault, about the senshi. I made a<br/>deal with one of them, a powerful temporal mage, to teach them magic<br/>in exchange for a way to mask that damned demonic prescence that I<br/>give off. Turns out that I got screwed over in the deal. The thing<br/>that hides my true prescence turns me into a girl. Guess I should<br/>have known better than to make a blood pact."<p>Phil was looking at me in sympathy, horror, and not a small amount of<br/>anger."You're actually teaching those little girls how to be better<br/>killers? Ranma, I thought you were smarter than that." Not many<br/>people can get a moral dressing down from a demon that's feasting on<br/>someone's heart, my nextdoor neighbor for all I know.<p>"Look at it from my perspective. I'm human. I figured maybe with<br/>Pluto's help I could actually settle down for a little while, have a<br/>relationship that lasted for more than a weekend, and get a job.<br/>Always have wanted to try my hand at assasination." There's supposed<br/>to be this big time law firm out in L. A. that specializes in super<br/>natural stuff. They occassionally put word out that they were<br/>recruiting."But the ring she gave me turns me into a girl whenever I<br/>use it. This isn't exactly fun on my part. Sailor Pluto is probably<br/>wishing that she had never met me now, though." I grinned maliciously.<br/>"Remember that big book of curses I found in your closet last year?"<br/>Phil nodded."She's currently on number seventy three."<p>The breath hissed out of Phil and Cindy's lipless mouths in their form<br/>of laughter."Where'd you put the nipple?" he asked, the topic of mine<br/>and his senshi problems forgotten for the moment.<p>I tapped the end of my nose."It should fade away in a few months, but<br/>for now it'll be hard as hell to cover up."<p>"When you say she's on the superfluous nipple curse, do you mean<br/>you've done all the ones before that to her?" Cindy asked. She too<br/>must have a copy of that book.<p>"Yep, all in two weeks, too." I watched tv while the demons finished<br/>their meal. When they had cleaned up their mess, they joined me in<br/>the living room."Where you been lately?"<p>"Family reunion," Phil answered."My great-great aunt was in charge<br/>this year and she picked a plane so far from earth that we had to<br/>sacrifice ten virgins just to get there. She was 'accidentally' left<br/>behind when everyone else went home." Phil shuddered."It was a<br/>horrible place, Ranma, all covered in wild flowers and cute little<br/>birds."<p>I mysef don't really have anything against flowers or birds, I do<br/>however know the effects they can have on some demons. I grimaced in<br/>sympathy. Back to more important issues."I know for a fact that the<br/>senshi won't be out for the next few hours and they don't go out in<br/>the morning. I've been regularly kicking their asses and calling it<br/>physical training." It really was but Phil didn't need to know that."I<br/>wouldn't bet on any one of them being able to stand right now."<p>"Could we crash here? Cindy and I both had to use a lot of energy to<br/>escape."<p>"Sure, no problem. I don't have a spare bedroom, but this couch is<br/>one of those fold out deals."<p>Cindy was in the bathroom doing whatever female demons do to get ready<br/>for bed when Phil slipped over to me and my latest attempt to locate<br/>Setsuna's home. The spell collapsed before it even got close. Oh<br/>well.<p>"Ranma, I didn't want to mention it in front of Cindy, there's no<br/>reason to frighten her, but there were some other guys out tonight.<br/>They were all nontalented humans, I'm sure, but they had some unusual<br/>weapons with them. They tried to get us when Cindy was unconscious<br/>from the energy drain of a spell, but when we got away they turned on<br/>the devil hunters. Just figured you might not want to get too<br/>comfortable in that women disguise. They probably won't care if you<br/>come across as good or evil."<p>"What kind of weapons?" I asked while using a small hand broom to<br/>clean up the chalk dust from the spell. I think that I had spotted<br/>the same guys Phil was talking about last week, real military types,<br/>but I needed to be sure.<p>"Looked like a new kind of stun weapon that throws weak energy bolts.<br/>Not particularly strong by itself, but they could lay down continuous<br/>fire and there were at least a dozen of them."<p>I nodded. That kind of firepower can add up quick like."This place is<br/>safe, I'm sure. If you want to you and Cindy can just stay for as<br/>long as it takes to fully recover and I'll help you leave the city. I<br/>don't really get much company, anyway."<p>****<p>"Listen up girls," I said to the gathered senshi. I'm proud to say<br/>that Ami and Makoto were taking the time before lessons began to<br/>practice what I had already taught them."If you ever run across a<br/>couple of demons with yellow hamburgerish skin that drips puss, don't<br/>try to hurt them unless they're trying to tear someone's heart out.<br/>Even then I just want you to scare them away." I had talked this out<br/>earlier with Phil, just encase he ever needed to hold up in my<br/>apartment sometime.<p>"We fought some like that last night," Usagi said cheerfully.<p>"Yeah, those are the same ones I'm talking about. They're friends of<br/>mine and the only reason that one of you girls isn't short a heart<br/>this morning is because they were tired from fighting off earlier<br/>attacks by more wannabe devil hunters like yourselves."<br/>3...2...1...bingo!<p>"Friends?" Rei exploded."You're friends with heart eating puss<br/>demons?" she demanded.<p>"Actually they're heart eating chaos demons. Puss demons are much<br/>more lumpy and have a gray complexion. And yes, I'm friends with<br/>them. I'm friends with lots of demons. You don't think some little<br/>old lady working in a tea shop taught me magic, do you?" I snapped.<p>Rei seemed no less angry, but her enthusiasm was greatly<br/>deflated."But...demons..."<p>"Not all demons are bad," I said carefully."Sure some of them may eat<br/>a person occassionally, but who here doesn't like to eat a<br/>cheeseburger every once in a while. It's not there fault that they<br/>were made that way. I would have died years ago if demons hadn't<br/>saved my life." I let that sink in before continuing."I'm not saying<br/>don't kill demons. No, if you see one minding it's own business just<br/>scare it off. They tend to go into hiding for a while if confronted<br/>by someone strong enough to take them out. Demons in the process of<br/>killing, eating, or hunting people, they're fair game."<p>"You can't tell us what to do," Rei almost shouted. Angry tendrils of<br/>flame were writhing around her hands. Oh ho, what have we here? She<br/>couldn't honestly be planning to challenge me. Only Usagi had that<br/>potential, and that was years and a brain transplant down the road.<p>"Well, not really, but my advice is still worth listening to. Mostly<br/>because almost all demons you find just walking around not trying to<br/>do demonic things are suppremely confident in themselves, which mean<br/>they have power, maybe more than you can handle. None of you girls<br/>should forget that you're just beginners in the heavy sorceries."<p>The next few hours were spent going over simple katas for the energy<br/>swords that I had included in the new senshi transformation. I didn't<br/>really care whether they cut their own feet off with the things or<br/>not, but it was so fun watching Usagi try to fight a tree, I just<br/>couldn't help myself. I wrapped up the session by introducing them<br/>each to the first part of a new spell. They were far enough along<br/>that I had broken their education up to the elemental affinities that<br/>they so strongly possessed. Their limitation was going to save me<br/>years of time.<p>Ami caught up to me before I left and asked,"Earlier today when you<br/>said that demons saved your life, why did they do it?"<p>"They thought that what my father was doing to me was atrocious and<br/>that children shouldn't have to suffer like I was." She gave me a<br/>blank stare full of horror. Oops, I think I gave her the wrong<br/>idea."He was trying to teach me a new martial arts technique. It<br/>involved throwing me into a pit of starving cats while wrapped in fish<br/>stuff. I was six at the time, so you can imagine..."<p>She lost the repulsed look and got one of profound sympathy."Was your<br/>father a demon?" she asked in a whisper."I promise not to tell<br/>anyone."<p>"No," I laughed,"he isn't a demon. He's just the biggest moron ever."<br/>I patted her shoulder."Thanks for caring though." My fading into the<br/>shadows didn't really suprise her. She was far enough along and<br/>sensitive enough to trace my path through the darkness.<p>****<p>Over the next few weeks the senshi continued to learn from Ranma.<br/>With the exception of Usagi, they were all steadily improving, Ami<br/>most of all. Setsuna found herself the victim of three hundred and<br/>seventeen temporary curses, a new world record. A race of super<br/>powerful dimensional space slugs landed on earth with the intention of<br/>conquering it for its use as a vacation spot. Fortunately the<br/>invasion fleet arrived in the oven of a noted French restaurant and<br/>was never heard from again.<p>The population of the United States of America embraced Windows X with<br/>the same whole hearted enthusiasm that they always have for new and<br/>mostly useless crap. Unfortunately, Windows X allowed Bill Gates to<br/>take control of all electronic equipment larger than a wrist watch.<br/>The United States was promptly renamed the Land of Gates. The new<br/>Wizard of Gates immediately began funding an advanced genetic research<br/>program with the mission of reingineering Janet Reno into a sasquatch.<p>****<p>"Anyone want to go out for ice cream?" I asked.<p>The girls were all pretty perky because I hadn't made them do anything<br/>but memorize part of a spell. I had never invited them out with me,<br/>though, and I wasn't sure how they would react. It was damned funny<br/>the way Usagi's eyes glazed over and she began drooling.<p>"Ice cream!" the blonde cheered.<p>Mental note: use ice cream to make the idiot learn. All I had to do<br/>was work out some kind of controllable mental suggestion that wouldn't<br/>allow her to eat ice cream...hmm, that bore definite thinking over.<p>"That'd be great," Minako said with much greater control than I had<br/>expected.<p>The ice cream parlor was about to close when we finally arrived, but<br/>when the man behind the counter saw Usagi he threw a knife across the<br/>room and pinned the sign that a younger man was turning to say Closed<br/>to the wall.<p>"Are you stupid, Hiroshi?" the man snapped."Who do you think I get<br/>enough money from to pay you?" he asked, all the while discreetly<br/>pointing to Usagi.<p>This was scary."What's going on," I whispered to Makoto.<p>"Oh, nothing really. Usagi only put his children through college and<br/>kept him going through that last recession." The way she said this<br/>with such nonchallance was by itself amazing. If the girl ate that<br/>much ice cream, how did she maintain her figure(only interested out of<br/>curisouity, not feminine vanity)?<p>"Oh," was my only response.<p>Over the next hour I witnessed something that will remain in my memory<br/>for however many millenia I shall live. Usagi Tsuniko, one of my<br/>least favorite people in existance, consumed three times her own body<br/>weight in a combination of forty six different kinds of ice cream and<br/>a vast array of toppings. At first I assumed that she may be able to<br/>convert mass to energy, that would explain her high energy levels, but<br/>I ruled that out pretty quickly. That much energy would have turned<br/>her into a human glowbug, permanently.<p>I thought my two gallons were respectable, but the condescending sneer<br/>the girl levelled at me was as humiliating as anything I could<br/>remember.<p>****<p>My first run in with the militarty guys came a few days later. I was<br/>just stepping out of a corner convenience store with a few necessities<br/>when men and women in black fatigues overlaid withsome kind of plastic<br/>body armor came swarming over the walls on repelling lines and filled<br/>the street with three large vans which poured forth more of the<br/>soldiers. Heh, guess they thought I was pretty important. I counted<br/>sixty visible individuals and three snipers positioned further down<br/>either side of the street.<p>"Hey, nice night out, eh?" I asked innocently, staling for as much<br/>time to erect my defenses as possible. Ooo, a helicopter. I'm moving<br/>up in the world.<p>"Place your hands above your head and slowly walk into the light,"<br/>ordered a man who sounded like he had had a baseball bat shoved up his<br/>ass at birth.<p>Now these guys obviously had some pretty reliable sources of<br/>information and they were extremely well trained if they were willing<br/>to hunt down demons without magic, technology be damned, so what made<br/>them think having my hands in the air would matter one way or the<br/>other when I started blowing stuff up.<p>"Nice guns, coulda swore those were illegal in Japan," I commented as<br/>I complied with the order, first setting my groceries out of harm's<br/>way on a newspaper rack. Phil had been right on the money when he<br/>described the weapons they carried. I could feel the electric charge<br/>contained within them. I couldn't stop a derisive snort from<br/>escaping. Completely non-magical. Phil must have been good and tired<br/>before he ran into the goons. They probably were effective against<br/>vampires and the like, though.<p>"Do not speak unless you are spoken to," baseball bat ordered.<p>Blah blah blah. Poor guy's one of those dips who gets off on telling<br/>other people what to do, or I'm not about to throw this fireball...<br/>"Kiyaaahh!" Heh, bet they weren't expecting that! The ball of emerald<br/>green fire grew from a pinprick of light a meter from my chest and<br/>into a two foot sphere of controlled death in a fraction of a second.<br/>This was going to be a majorly bad way for all these relatively<br/>innocent people to die.<p>Tiny bolts of electricity rebounded from my personal shields for<br/>another second or two before the sphere exploded. I couldn't make it<br/>take out the snipers without killing a few dozen families, so I guess<br/>word would be getting back to the guys in charge what I was capable<br/>of. If only they really knew.<p>Around me and my little calm piece of space, green and purple fires<br/>raged, slowly eating away at anything living. The screams were ear<br/>splitting and lasted for nearly a minute. When I cut power to the<br/>magical fire, the street was littered with the clothes, armor and<br/>weapons of all the dead soldiers, and there were three vans with<br/>government tags on them sitting as pretty as you please in the middle<br/>of the street with no evidence that they had ever been occupied.<p>I wondered if they were really government sanctioned or if the plates<br/>were false. If they were false then I had just pissed off a really<br/>rich man or woman that had more money than they know what to do with<br/>and could expect to deal with more of the same shit on a regular<br/>basis. If they were government, everything would be the same as above<br/>except I would most likely be killing more of them next time.<p>****<p>I decided I'd better warn the senshi, just encase they, too, were now<br/>in season. The shrine where Rei lived was the only place I knew of to<br/>find any of them, so I headed there as soon as I returned my groceries<br/>to the apartment.<p>The shrine was closed for the night and I had to knock on the door for<br/>a few minutes before anyone answered. I remembered to go girl only<br/>moments before the door opened. It was that little old man I'd seen a<br/>few times while teaching the senshi. He seemed nice enough and never<br/>butted into other people's business so I had nothing against him. Too<br/>bad he was so old, he would have made an excellant sorceror.<p>"Ah, young Ranma, what can I do for you at such a late hour?" he asked<br/>cheerfully. The old guy gave me the once over, but I couldn't really<br/>blame him, not when I spent a considerable amount of time in front of<br/>the mirror every morning checking out my own bod.<p>"Is Rei here? What I need to tell her could wait till tomorrow if she<br/>isn't, but it's important that I speak to her if she is." I felt him<br/>sloppily probing my aura as I spoke. Hmm, he most definitely had had<br/>more than the spiritual training expected of a shinto priest.<p>"Of course she's home," the grandfather replied. I think he was Rei's<br/>grandfather, anyway."Come in, come in." He led me through the spacious<br/>interior living quarters and stopped in front of a traditional sliding<br/>door."I'll leave you two to your girl talk."<p>As the little old man made himself scarce, I knocked on the wooden<br/>frame of the paper door."It's me, Ranma, open up."<p>A few seconds later the door slid open and Rei stood staring at me in<br/>a pair of baggy red and black pajamas."What do you want?" She didn't<br/>sound happy.<p>"Lighten up. I came to warn you since I don't know where the other<br/>senshi live. I was attacked by a company of commandoes tonight. From<br/>reliable sources I have info that they're going after anybody with<br/>supernatural abilities, good or bad, regardless of intentions. Call<br/>the others on that cute little wristphone thing and tell them to meet<br/>at the shrine at 6:30 tomorrow morning. And from now on don't go<br/>anywhere by yourself, always have at least one other senshi with you.<br/>Oh yeah, feel free to kill as many of them as you can if they do try<br/>to take you in." I finished and turned to leave, catching the barest<br/>hint of a nod from the girl.<p>****<p>Author's Notes: I really need suggestions on this fic. It's weird.<br/>Tell me if you think I'm being too hard on Usagi. I'm sorta<br/>biased(really hate her). Send me C&amp;C at dark_<p>
