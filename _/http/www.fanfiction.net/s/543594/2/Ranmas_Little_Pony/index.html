</div><p>Ranma's Little Pony<p>by K.M.<p>2-2-02<p>A Ranma 1/2 / My Little Pony Crossover<p>Ranma 1/2 created by Rumiko Takahashi<br/>Copyright 1992 Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan, Inc. All rights reserved<br/>Trademarked by Viz Communications, Inc. All rights reserved<p>My Little Pony is Trademarked by Hasbro, Inc. All Rights Reserved<p>This story was originally written for nonprofit entertainment only, please don't sue me.<p>Chapter 2:<br/>Japan<p>Unbeknownst to the other ponies, a human girl was currently inside Paradise Estate busily making preparations. While a human girl in Paradise Estate wasn't unusual in itself, what was unusual was that the girl in question was neither Megan, nor Molly. The girl in question was in fact the latest draftee of the Jusenkyo swimming team.<p>At the moment the girl was looking into a full-length mirror. She was still trying to get used to how much smaller everything in Paradise Estate looked while walking upright. She knew that the increase in height from which she was viewing things really wasn't that great, but still, she almost felt like a giant. She figured Megan probably felt the same way at times while visiting Paradise Estate, though the same clearly couldn't be applied to Molly since she was almost the same height as most ponies.<p>As she looked into the mirror she couldn't help but admire the changes Jusenkyo had done to her. While she looked completely human, and would be hard to be mistaken for pony, she could still see many aspects of herself in her knew form. Her hair was still the same pale pink as her mane and tail were, and while she lacked a tail on her human form, Jusenkyo seemed to decide to lengthen the hair from her head to make up for the absence. Her hair now went down to the back of her legs, and still kept it's natural curl. Feeling the hair brush against the back of her legs almost made it feel as tough her tail was still there.<p>She turned slightly so that she could see her hip reflected in the mirror. The smile she was already wearing grew brighter. She never even suspected it at first while she was back in China, but she was extremely pleased that Jusenkyo had let her keep birthmarks. They were a little smaller on her human form, and the pink and blue coloring was a little different, but they were unmistakably her birthmarks. If any pony had chosen that moment to walk in on her, and see the birthmarks on her hips, they would surely guess it was her.<p>"Vanity can wait for later" she said to herself jokingly as she shook her head and pulled herself away from the mirror.<p>She decided to continue to get ready for her next visit to Earth. She had already almost finished packing for her trip. She had basically packed only essentials, those being food and a blanket, just in case she didn't catch the next rainbow home and had to spend some extra time on Earth. She had camped out before in Ponyland and was more than capable of roughing it when she needed to. All she really needed was the blanket in case wherever she wound up had somewhat cold nights, and she couldn't fly someplace warmer in time. Besides, she didn't want to carry too much as it made it harder to fly properly.<p>All that was left to pack was one thing, and the main reason that she came back to Ponyland before continuing her explorations. Clothing. Fortunately she remembered that Megan, Molly, and Danny kept some spare clothing at Paradise Estate. It was a sensible idea since some of the adventures they had gone on in Ponyland could get rough, and Megan and the others might have some explaining to do if they arrived home in tattered clothes.<p>Her idea to borrow some of Megan's clothing wasn't going quite as well as she'd hoped however. She very briefly considered trying on a pair of Megan's overalls, but quickly dismissed the idea. She decided it would be best if she just went with a shirt and shorts instead as she felt they would be easier to get in and out of when she needed to change forms. She first tried on a pair of Megan's shorts that Megan sometimes wore on hot summer visits, but they were too tight. She then tried on one of Megan's shirts, but it fit her even worse than the shorts. She looked down at her chest appraisingly.<p>"Hmm... My chest seems to protrude more so than Megan's" she said in a manner not unlike a doctor performing an examination.<p>She looked at the rest of the clothing, but it all looked pretty much the same, and she wasn't sure any of it was going to fit any better.<p>"This could prove to be more difficult than I first expected," she said with some disappointment.<p>***<p>Sometime later she walked into the study, once again in her pegasus form, carrying a small duffel-like bag by it's strap in her mouth. It had taken a little while, but she felt she had found some clothing that would do for her trip. She eventually had to settle on using a pair of Danny's swimming trunks, since all of Megan's shorts and pants were too tight on her. At least the swimming trunks had an elastic waistband, and were even somewhat comfortable. As far she could tell, by all outward appearances they looked like any other pair of shorts, so she felt she wouldn't look out of place wearing them.<p>Finding a shirt had proven even more difficult as all the human shirts were too small on her. She eventually had to go through some pony clothing to find a shirt that would fit. Although she wasn't typically one of them, some of the other ponies would sometimes wear clothing on one occasion or another. The shirt she finally settled on was, as she expected, a bit loose on her human form, but otherwise seemed to fit fine.<p>After solving her clothing problem, she had to wait awhile for a new rainbow to appear, but fortunately rainbows were extremely common in Ponyland. Usually, there were always a few rainbows a day, and one only had to be patient and on the lookout for where the next one would appear. Now that a new one had appeared she was ready for her next trip.<p>She set her bag down and walked over to the globe so she could choose her next destination. She was tempted to go right back to China and begin her explorations there, but was concerned of the possibility of appearing over Jusenkyo again. If the winds over Jusenkyo were common she might find herself crashing into a far less convenient spring.<p>"Or worse!" she thought as she remembered those poles she managed to avoid the last time. True she could try for another part of China, but she felt it might be best to wait until she was completely certain of her newfound source of travel.<p>She also considered going to see Megan, revealing her curse, and exploring America with her. However, upon returning to Ponyland, she decided to keep her curse to herself for the time being and enjoy herself in secret. She scanned the globe as she searched for other possible destinations. She noticed there was a country on the globe not too far away from China with a language that she spoke, and decided that it would be the perfect place to stop next.<p>Once again she focused on the spot she had chosen and began to concentrate. Once she was confident she had her new destination firm in her mind she slipped her head through the strap of her bag and then went outside.<p>She turned to the new rainbow, which had appeared a bit further away, and to the east of Paradise Estate. She then flew off towards it. Within a few minutes she had reached the rainbow. Once again she concentrated on her new destination as she passed over it.<p>Upon reaching the other side of the rainbow, she waited for mist to clear and looked at the landscape below. From what she could see, the architecture of the buildings in the town she appeared over looked as though they might be of Japanese origin, at least as best as she could remember from some of the books about Earth she had read.<p>She suddenly noticed a small change in the currents of wind. Many times a change like this was nothing important and she would simply ignore it, however, the last time she had felt such a change was just before the huge winds had started that caused her to crash into Jusenkyo. This time she made sure not to dismiss the change and her reflexes readied themselves.<p>The change in the currents wasn't all that much warning however, and she once again found a turbulent wind quickly arising and tossing her about. Fortunately, she had readied herself enough so that this time she was managing to maintain a bit more control. However, she was still being forced down, but at least this time it might not be as serious a crash landing. She hoped.<p>She continued to traverse the winds as she tried to come in for a landing, albeit a rocky one.<p>It was going to be a bit rough, but she was becoming more confident that it wouldn't be as bad as the last time. Suddenly she felt her hopes dash a bit as she looked at the trajectory she was on. She was going to hit someone on the ground. There looked to be a dark haired adolescent boy right in her reentry path and standing in front of a pond. And worse, he was facing away from her.<p>"LOOK OUT!" she hollered as she came right at the boy.<p>The boy quickly turned, but only fast enough to see nothing but a patch of light blue as the pony flew into him hard, knocking him out and the two of them into the pond behind the boy.<p>Still conscious herself, and once again in human form thanks to the pond, she quickly tended to the boy. She could see he was unconscious and was about to wake him up and apologize when she heard something sloshing in the water behind her. She turned just in time to see a huge set of jaws with rows of sharp teeth coming at the two of them. She barely managed to pull herself and the boy away from the creature and out of the pond. Her bag unfortunately wasn't so lucky as the creature ripped it and it's content's to shreds.<p>She watched in a state of relief at what had nearly befallen her and the boy. She slowly tried to calm herself and slow her breathing. The creature, now done with attacking the bag, continued to eye her from the pond, but didn't seem content to leave it's confines. Eventually it decided to go back to swimming about it's home, only throwing an occasional glance at the girl now and again.<p>"Well," she thought, her breathing now pretty much back to normal, "aside from nearly impaling myself on a pole, crashing into a cursed spring, rendering an adolescent boy unconscious, and nearly getting devoured by an alligator, I'd have to say my travels are going quite well."<p>She was one of those individuals who tried to look on the bright side of things, but at times like these she really needed to use humor to do so.<p>She once again turned her attention back to the boy, she just hoped he wouldn't be too upset with her. She shook him a bit and lightly slapped his face with her hand in an attempt to rouse him.<p>His eyes still closed, the boy began to regain consciousness. He wondered what had happened to him as he tried recalling the recent events. He remembered practicing in front of the pond when he heard an unfamiliar female voice cry out a warning. He then turned and that was all he could remember.<p>No! He could remember being struck. An attack perhaps? By why would a girl he apparently didn't know, by the sound of her voice anyway, attack him? Of course, what other possible reason could there be?<p>He opened his eyes to see a girl before him who seemed to be concerned. Only twice before had seen such a vision of loveliness. He suddenly became aware of her state of undress, seeming to confirm his beliefs.<p>"Yes, I will date with you!" the boy cried as he quickly sat up and embraced the girl.<p>"E-excuse me?" the girl said nervously in Japanese, just as she had heard the boy speaking in.<p>"No need to be coy, my love. You have defeated the Great Tatewaki Kuno and have won the right to date with me."<p>Oh no! She must have inadvertently engaged in some sort of human mating ritual that was localized to this part of the world. She had to find some way to make him understand that it was all a mistake.<p>"Sir, please." she a said as she tried to escape from his embrace, "I'm afraid you misconstrue my actions. I assure you that my unorthodox arrival was quite unintentional, and that it was but an unfortunate happenstance that caused me to collide with you."<p>Instead of being perplexed by the girl's choice of words Kuno was actually encourage by them. She may not have been using speech akin to the beauty of poetry or classical literature, but the girl was clearly quite educated.<p>"There is no need to be shy my love, clearly you are overcome by your moment of triumph and are simply nervous about claiming your prize."<p>Kuno then leaned in to kiss her.<p>"Sir! Please, you don't understand!" she cried out desperately as she continued to try and break free of the embrace.<p>Kuno's head came closer and closer. Suddenly his head seemed to drop downward and away from her face. The girl then noticed there seemed to be something on his head, it looked like... shoes?<p>She looked up to see another dark haired boy, this one with a pigtail, standing on top of Kuno's head. The boy's weight obviously forcing Kuno's head away from her.<p>"Am I interrupting anything?" the pigtailed boy said in a cheery voice as he looked down at Kuno's head.<p>"Be gone!" Kuno yelled as he got up and the pigtailed boy leapt off his head.<p>Kuno quickly looked around the pond and found his bokken that he dropped when he was knocked into the pond.<p>"Foul wretch, you dare interfere with the blessed love of two individuals?" Kuno cried angrily.<p>The pigtailed boy didn't buy it for a minute, but nonetheless looked over to the girl for confirmation. The girl quickly shook her head 'no' to the implied question. That was all the pigtailed boy needed.<p>"Have at thee!" yelled Kuno as he charged the pigtailed boy.<p>The pigtailed boy easily dodged the first several advances Kuno made. When he saw an opening he quickly took advantage of it and landed a kick to Kuno's head, once again rendering the Great Tatawaki Kuno unconscious.<p>"Idiot. Can't you even take a break from your insanity at home?" the pigtailed boy said with a bit of disdain. He always hated when he had to pass by the Kuno Estate as it just invited trouble, but for once he was glad that he did. He hated to think of what might have happened to the girl if he hadn't. He was just glad he overheard them a little as he passed by.<p>Remembering the girl, the pigtailed boy turned to her.<p>"You okay?" he asked. The boy then went slightly stiff. He was so focused on Kuno before that he hadn't really been paying too much attention to the girl, but he was now more than well aware that she wasn't wearing anything.<p>"Yes, I believe so" the girl said as she felt a certain amount of déjà vu, she was about to continue and thank him when she noticed the boy was blushing and seemed to be making a great effort not to look at her.<p>"Is something wrong?" she asked.<p>"Umm..." the boy started while sweating a bit, "Where are your... umm... clothes?"<p>The girl's eyes went a little wide as she quickly looked down at herself and then ran over to the pond. She was rather embarrassed, not because of any sense of modesty but because she had completely forgotten about her clothing when the Kuno boy tried to initiate a relationship with her.<p>She found what was left of her belongings near the edge of the pond. The alligator was still at the other end so she quickly gathered what she could.<p>"He's almost completely shredded them." she said sadly and with a bit of disbelief. There was no way she could wear them now, and now she was going to have cut short her second trip too.<p>The pigtailed boy looked at the scraps she was holding and noticed Kodachi's alligator at the other end of the pond. He then also noticed that Kuno and the girl were wet. He figured Kuno and the girl probably fell into the pond, probably while she was trying to escape from Kuno, and that Kodachi's alligator must have attacked the two of them and ripped her clothes right off of her and shredded them. The girl obviously wasn't having a good day.<p>Well he couldn't very well leave her there as Kuno was bound to wake up soon. He supposed he could lend her some clothing back at the dojo but she'd still needed something she could wear to get there. Going inside the Kuno Estate to look for clothing would just be asking for even more trouble. He could just picture running into Kodachi and what she might say and do to the girl. Probably something along the lines of "How dare you expose yourself to my beloved!"<p>The boy then walked over to the still unconscious Kuno. He looked down at Kuno and frowned.<p>"Beggar's can't be choosers I guess," the pigtailed boy thought as he began to take Kuno's kendo robe off. The robe was still pretty drenched but it was better than nothing, and should be large enough to cover the girl pretty well. He began wringing out the water from the robe, being careful not to let any great amounts of the water to get on him.<p>"I think I can lend you some clothes back at the dojo. You can wear this until we get there." he said as he handed the kendo robe to the girl.<p>"I'm not certain if I should borrow his clothing without getting his permission first" the girl said as she considered the offer.<p>The boy blinked in surprise. Of all the girls he knew, if one had just been through what this one had, most would probably be close to skewering Kuno. But this girl was actually worried about whether doing something minor was the right thing to do after she'd just been wronged. This caused him to smile, it was sadly too rare that he met such people.<p>"It's okay, it's the least he can do after what he put you through. Don't worry I'll return it to him." he said.<p>The girl thought it over a little. She supposed he was right, and there didn't seem to be any harm in it.<p>"Very well then" she said as she accepted the kendo robe. "I appreciate all of the succor that you've provided to me since your arrival, it could not have occurred at more opportune time."<p>The boy just stared at her. That last statement was in Japanese, he was certain of it, but that still didn't seem to make it all that easy for him to follow.<p>"Huh?" he asked.<p>The girl just stared back at the confused boy for a moment.<p>"Thank you for your help" she said speaking at slightly slower pace.<p>Once again the boy blinked in surprise. It was true he had been thanked from time to time, but much to his sadness those times seemed few and far between. Far too many times the people he helped would turn on him for one reason or another instead of thanking him. Once again a smile was brought to the boy's face.<p>"No problem." he said.<p>"Oh, I just realized I don't even know your name." the girl said.<p>The boy gave a slightly cocky grin and replied "Ranma. Ranma Saotome."<p>The girl smiled and gave him a small nod. "It's a pleasure to meet you Ranma, my name is Wind Whistler."<p>Next Chapter:<br/>Wind Whistler?<p>Authors Notes:<p>Wow! There are more Ranma fans who know of MLP than I thought (no matter how much some may regret it).<p>Thanks for all the reviews guy and gals, I really enjoyed and appreciated them (even those that rightfully questioned my sanity).<p>I just wanted to touch base on a few things people have asked or commented on:<p>As you can probably tell by the way that this chapter ended, I intentionally kept from mentioning Wind Whistler's name in Chapter 1. I wanted to see if any other Ranma fans had actually seen the series, and see if anyone could guess who the starring pony was.<p>Congratulations to everyone who guessed correctly. And to those who are embarrassed because they were able to guess correctly, look on the bright side, YOU don't have to write dialogue for her! (What have I gotten myself into?)<p>Before anyone comments on them, there's a reason those jet streams are hounding Wind Whistler (stay tuned).<p>To the best of my knowledge this is the 1st Ranma 1/2 / My Little Pony crossover (I did look around after getting the idea). I later found out that one of the people who read my story did have the idea before me, but they had trouble reconciling some things within the plot of their story so it never got started.<p>Apparently I wasn't the first to do an Anime/My Little Pony crossover however. After writing Chapter 1, I did a less specific search on the web and found these Anime/MLP crossovers (all were on .net):<p>Pony Wing by Burning Ice (former pen name: Fizzy) (Gundam Wing) - Very funny, even though I know next to nothing about Gundam Wing.<p>My Little Soldier: Sailor Moon by Alicorn (Sailor Moon) - Cute story, basically Sailor Moon pony-style.<p>Apparently 2001 was the year for Anime/MLP crossovers.<p>For the actual MLP fans, it turns out .net actually has a My Little Pony category (who knew?).<p>Just follow the links from the home page: Home Cartoons My Little Pony<p>Oh yeah, before I forget, this is my 1st attempt at a fanfic so you'll have to bear with me when it comes to the quality of my writing (shouldn't there be new term for 21st century? While I'm sure there are more than a few, how many actually WRITE stories, instead of using a word processor?).</p>
