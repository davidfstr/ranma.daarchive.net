</div>Cornerstone<p>By D'Fused<p>Disclaimer: Check the previous chapters.<p>Chapter 3<p>- - -<p>Ryoga waited in the hall across from the door that led to the bath.<p>Why did he have to wait, he mentally thought. Having a hot bath was rare for him in the last few years. In the week since he started staying here, he had continual access to this luxury and wanted to make full use of it.<p>{Because Akane is most liekly in there,} the vistor in his mind said.<p>Are you sure?<p>{Positive. She forgets to turn the sign to 'Occupied' usually. Her father and sisters know she takes a bath each night at about this time.}<p>And no one thought to tell him this?<p>{I am telling you. Also I just avoided a bad situation right now.}<p>Akane wouldn't have liked him entering, huh?<p>{I know she would've slapped you,} Theta replied, {and it would've made things between you two harder.}<p>How long is she going to be?<p>Theta seemed to contemplate this for a second before answering, {If she sticks to her usual routine...}<p>The sound of a door opening could be heard from the place in question.<p>{Pretty soon.}<p>Ryoga didn't bother replying to that. A quick mental image of Akane naked went through his head, which he even quicker replaced with images of a technique he was rereading earlier.<p>{Interesting,} Theta said, amused at what Ryoga had just pictured and his host's reaction. {It's good to see you have some thoughts towards your fiancee like that. Although I should tell you the image isn't completely right. She has a little more there, and a little less...}<p>NO! DON'T TELL ME! Ryoga yelled mentally, once again banishing a certain image from his head.<p>{Alright, since it makes you nervous, I'll drop the subject. You do have to get over the nosebleed though.} Ryoga's friend suddenly became very amused. {We wouldn't want you to die of bleeding on your wedding night.}<p>Ryoga brought a hand up to his nose, wiping away the red stain from his nose with his hand. At which time Akane decided she was ready to come out.<p>Some things stay true, no matter what changes.<p>"Look, Akane, you could have waited for me to explain..." a red-cheecked Ryoga said as he rubbed the pain away.<p>"What is there to explain? That you were just waiting to get a look at me naked?" Akane was in full voice, assuming the worse of her unwelcomed guest.<p>"No. I was waiting out here because you forgot to turn the sign over."<p>She quickly looked at the position of the sign.<p>"And how did you know I was there without looking in?"<p>"Theta." Ryoga gave a small shrug as his fancee mulled that over. Her reply was one he should have expected.<p>{This is not the best way to get on her good side.} the voice he knew as Theta did the eqivalent of a sigh. {Now she's angry at both of us.}<p>Over the last two yers, Ryoga had aquired some of Theta's calm and concentrated attitude towards most things. But, with these changes, he had also picked up a few changes in his behavior, including responses to certain events<p>So when Ryoga felt the matching welt on his other cheeck, his first remark surprzed him as it would anyone else.<p>Uncute tomboy.<p>Silence was Theta's response for about a full three seconds before the laughter started.<p>-<p>Kasumi watched their houseguest read in the living room from the kitchen entrance. Although he said he was in training for a fight, she had caught him spending hours everyday, usually after supper or before bed, bent over one of several different books. Occasionally, he would nod his head, an action that would seem out of place on most people.<p>Of course, most people didn't have voices in their heads that could coach them in martial arts. Kasumi didn't doubt it; his sincerity since the first day she met him had made its mark, and nothing since had changed it.<p>"Hey, Kasumi?" Ryoga asked.<p>"Yes?"<p>Ryoga didn't even look up from the book he read. "Would you know why Akane is so violent towards boys? There has to be more to it than just because she fights a whole group of them every school morning."<p>Kasumi cocked her head in a way she had when she gave something serious thought.<p>"Well, she was always an active child," she began. "Father had spent time training her, Nabiki and me when we were younger, before Mother died. Father stopped training anyone after that, even us, but Akane kept practicing. Father occasionally spars with her, but not regularly."<p>He didn't physically respond to this, but his next question did say he was paying attention.<p>"You wouldn't know how advanced her training is, by any chance?"<p>"Oh my, no," she answered, her usually cheerful face forming a slight frown. "I would have no idea. Father would though."<p>Their houseguest nodded at this. He shifted the book slightly to catch the light better, which turned him to slightly look at the oldest Tendo daughter.<p>"But what does she have against boys?" he asked.<p>Kasumi sat down at the new table Nabiki had bought to replace the one destroyed days ago. It was the first time she had talked personally with Ryoga, and he needed to know certain things. He sat up and joined her at the table, book closed and to his side.<p>"Ryoga, Akane is a sweet girl. Sure, she is sometimes violent, and has a temper, and occasionally throws things, but under that is a caring person. She just has . . . problems showing it."<p>Akane's fiancee seemed to take all of this in with no surprise. Kasumi blinked at his reaction, then everything made sense.<p>"Tell me Ryoga, did Theta tell you this?" she asked.<p>He looked away from the eldest daughter's eyes, an answer enough for her.<p>"He did say as much," he said, still looking down and away. "But he wouldn't tell me why Akane was so violent. Especially towards me. All I did was come here because Mother said I had to fulfill a promise. It was only along the way that I was told about the engagement."<p>"I was going to ask about that, Saotome," a voice said from the hall. Nabiki came around the corner, taking a seat beside her sister. "How did you become adopted? From what I've seen, becoming a member of your rival's family doesn't suit your style."<p>Ryoga chuckled softly. I knew this question was bound to come up.<p>{They have a legitamite right to know. You are engaged to their sister, after all,} his voice advised.<p>"Fair enough," he said, replying to both interior and exterior voices. Where should I begin?<p>{How about . . . }<p>-<p>So why was he here again?<p>{I've told you already. Ranma's father created two techniques that I think you need to know. One works with skills like invisibility, while the other works with blows that can seriously hurt, even kill, a person.}<p>And what could he do with skills that kill? Their fight wasn't to the death.<p>{Not for you, it isn't. Ranma might be another case.}<p>Ranma didn't seem the killing-type. . .<p>{The Ranma I know isn't. But everything about him has been sent to blind chance.}<p>Blind chance?<p>{Everything about him is uncertain, even to me, so he could do almost anything. There is no set rule about killing the rival; it was implied all along. Ranma might not be as inclined to stop before killing you, and he might try to learn the techniques since they are so close at hand. Genma has those techniques sealed, and even if Ranma does learn them, Delta should take care of that. Just to be safe, I want you to learn the same techniques.}<p>Ryoga looked at the one-story house across the street from him. It was a livable house, although from the outside it looked run-down.<p>{It's enough for the family that lives here. Not everyone can live in large houses in Japan, and some of the best families can live happily on very little.}<p>So who lives here?<p>{Someone who has close ties to Ranma.}<p>Who?<p>{His mother.}<p>Mrs. Saotome?<p>{You're right. Although she doesn't know it, Nodoka Saotome holds the scroll to the Yamasenken techniques Genma created. He sent it to her when he sealed the techniques, deeming them too dangerous to use.}<p>Sealed?<p>{Without going into details, there is a mental block martial artists can do, to make themselves forget moves not ideal to use in training or even combat. Its a sort of combination of self-induced hypnosis and anmesia, which means it is forgotten, but, if a true need comes up, they can 'break' the seal and remember everything about it.}<p>Oh . . .<p>{You didn't understand a word I just said. I can tell.}<p>Ryoga did what he usually did in a case like this; he shrugged it off, accepting him at his word. After three months of having Theta in his head, he had come to trust what he was told. If he didn't understand it at the time, it would make sense later.<p>Why did he need to see the scroll? Couldn't you just teach the technique?<p>{There is a difference between this and the Futae no Kiwame. I didn't really teach you it. What I did was, in fact, unseal it in your mind.}<p>Ryoga was startled by this. That meant the couple weeks I spent learning how to use the technique with his arms and legs were just. . .<p>{A refresher course, of sorts. I knew of the technique, seeing a good friend do it once, and he said that it had come to him as inspiration one day. He taught it to me, so I know how to do it. I personally can't teach you techniques I know; our minds aren't connected in that fashion. But I can direct you to the books and scrolls holding those same techniques. Once you see how they work, I can lead you through the training. But, in this special case, all I had to do was remove the seal, and all that was left was for you to learn it.}<p>So how could he know it? He never. . .<p>{No, but aparently one of your ancestors did. I guess sealed techniques can be genetically passed along, if they are sealed before the conception of their heir or such. I have never thought a thing could happen, or anyone else either, but its the only explanation I could see.}<p>When did you know?<p>{About that time when you broke that rock you were annoyed at. But we've strayed away from the topic at hand. Go knock on the door.}<p>Without thinking about it, he turned from the house and started walking away.<p>{Ryoga, stop. You got lost again.} Theta said in a tone of rote.<p>The Lost Boy stopped, waiting for directions to get where he needed to be. They had worked out the problem of him getting lost. Whenever Theta saw that he had taken a wrong turn, he would stop him, then correct his direction. Normally this meant he rotated in spot until he was looking at the the direction he needed to go. At the command that he was looking the right way, he moved forward carefully, trying not to take a wrong turn this close to their destination. He finally ended at the door to the house.<p>{See if anyone is home. Knock on the door.}<p>Ryoga did as much, waiting for an answer. As he waited, a thought came to him.<p>Would Ranma know those techniques naturally?<p>{The Yamasenken and Umisenken? No. Genma sealed them after Ranma was born. I know he has to learn them to use the techniques.}<p>So what . . .<p>"Hello."<p>The Hibiki child looked at the serene woman standing at the door. She was dressed plainly, but her small smile when she opened the door said she was content with what she had.<p>"Yes, can I help you?"<p>How could I ask for a scroll to beat her own son with?<p>{Are you sure you don't want to learn the technique?}<p>Learn it, yes. Not this way though.<p>{There is no other way to learn the technique. Genma is the only one who knows it, and he is with Ranma.}<p>Then I'll do without it.<p>"Sorry," he said. "I won't bother you anymore." Slightly bowing before turning away, Ryoga started along his way down the street. He had walked halfway down the block before he heard someone behind him.<p>"Ranma?"<p>Ryoga turned around to see Mrs Saotome running towards him, eyes wide as she caught up to him. She was breathing hard as she looked at his body, looking over his features as she catched her breath.<p>{She thinks you're Ranma. Remember, she hasn't seen her son ever since her husband took him away.}<p>But I look nothing like Ranma.<p>{She sees a boy about Ranma's age. Someone who is obviously a martial artist, and has the same coloring and basic features. She might have missed the small fangs, but, other than that, there aren't many basic physical differences between you and Ranma.}<p>Yeah I guess she would jump to conclusions.<p>"Is that you Ranma? Oh I've waited all these years. . . ." she began.<p>"Sorry, Mrs. Saotome, I'm not your son," Ryoga responded. "I do know him though."<p>He could see her shoulders fall at the news of mistaken identity, but perked again at the last tidbit.<p>"You know him?" She asked eagerly.<p>"Yes, I . . ."<p>"Is he alright? Where is he? Is he manly? Is he a great martial artist? Is he strong?"<p>"Well, he . . . "<p>"Is he eating alrigfht? Is he smart? Do you know when he'll be coming home? Does he study? Is he a lady killer?"<p>"I don't . . ."<p>"Oh, please forgive my manners. I have so many questions for you. Please, come in Mr. . . .?" Mrs. Saotome asked.<p>"Um, Hibiki. Ryoga Hibiki." he said dumbly.<p>"Well, Ryoga, please come in and tell me about Ranma. I have wanted to know more than what Genma tells me in his letters." Then, turning suddenly, she started walking back. Ryoga was left staring at the instant stop of questions coming his way.<p>{Go inside,} Theta suggested mildly.<p>His mind jump-started by this, Ryoga quickly ran to catch up with his rival's mother, one of the last people he thought would be polite to him.<p>{She doesn't know that, remember?}<p>Will she treat him the same after she learns?<p>{Most likely. When we're inside, tell her everything about you and Ranma.}<p>Seriously? All of it? Even about you and Delta?<p>{Yes.}<p>-<p>"And she accepted your story, just like that?" Nabiki asked, not wanting to wait for Ryoga to say.<p>"Well, not at first," he replied, putting a hand behind his back. "I had to tell her everything, and then prove to her that Theta was there."<p>"How did you do that?" Nabiki asked, leaning in more as she waited for the answer.<p>"Simple. I told her information only a few people other than herself knew. Just like the way I told you about those photos you sold."<p>The middle sister's face reddened at that; she hadn't forgot that she owed him for that.<p>"I see," said Soun, who had joined everyone around the table half-way through the story, "You're saying that she mistaken you for Ranma?"<p>"She must have been very worried," Kasumi said, slightly frowning at the thought.<p>Ryoga nodded absently. He still was surpized at the need she had for information about her wayward husband and son. It always stunned him whenever he thought about it.<p>"Wait a minute," Nabiki said, "This happened after Ranma and his dad went to China, right?"<p>"Yeap." he replied, having a good idea where this was going to go.<p>"So Ranma doesn't know your his brother." she asked, making it sound more of a fact than question.<p>"Ranma doesn't know about it yet, and probably won't until sometime around the fight. I'd rather have him know afterward, rather than before though."<p>"So you can rub it in his nose that he was fighting his brother?" Nabiki said snidely.<p>"Nabiki," Kasumi chided her sister.<p>"It's all alright, Kasumi." Ryoga said good-naturely. "It does look like that from one view. Truthfully, me and our mother decided that Ranma might get the wrong idea if he were to hear about it before the fight."<p>"Gee, I wonder why," Nabiki said sarcatically.<p>"Well, Nabiki, do you want me to wait for you to finish, or should I continue on with my story?"<p>"Don't let me stop you, Saotome," she answered offhandedly, her voice implying otherwise.<p>"That's enough Nabiki," her father reprimanded. Then, in a less stern voice, "Son, continue. I want to know how you knew about a promise me and my good friend made years ago."<p>"Well, after that one day, I stopped by whenever I was nearby while training to talk to her," Ryoga started. "She was quite lonely, and always insisted that I stay for the day with her to talk. It was about only a month ago when I came to visit . . ."<p>-<p>"Ryoga! Its great to see you again."<p>"Thank you Mrs. Saotome," the boy grinned as he was invited into her house. "I was just in the area, and I thought . . ."<p>"Well, of course. You know I always like your and Theta's company. If you are willing to wait, we can have an early lunch while we talk."<p>"Well, if it's no burden . . ."<p>"You know it never is." Ranma's mother smiled a motherly smile as she turned to lead Ryoga to the kitchen.<p>{Something's strange.}<p>Ryoga frowned slightly as he stepped inside. What's wrong?<p>{She is too happy to see you today.}<p>Ryoga blinked at this. There's something wrong with her being happy?<p>{I'm not meaning that. She has some sort of surprize for you today.}<p>How do you know? Do you know what it is?<p>{I know her well enough that it can't be anything else, but I have no idea what it might be. We've messed with the story I know after talking to her the first time. I was thinking there would be no changes just because we talked to her occasionally. She's acting normally, but something might be different than how I know it now.}<p>She probably wants to give us a new shirt or something. She has done it before.<p>{Maybe.} Theta didn't sound reassured.<p>Ryoga didn't think more of it as he moved into the kitchen, expecting to help his host with the preparation, although she would protest even as she handed him a knife or spoon. What he found instead was her sitting at the table across from him, a piece of paper in front of her as she scribbled something at the bottom of it. She looked up as she finished, then passed it towards his side.<p>"Read it, Ryoga,' she said as he looked at the document.<p>He did as he was told, wondering what was so important that he had to read it. He was only half-way thorugh it before he started to get a sense of what the document was about. After he was done, he slowly looked at the person smiling a smile vaguely familiar.<p>{It was the one she wore the day you met her,} Theta confirmed. {The one she had when she thought you were her son.}<p>Mrs. Saotome, I . . . " Ryoga began.<p>"Please, call me Mother." she replied.<p>"Ah," he hesitated at that remark, "Just why did you do this? How did you find my mother? I haven't seen her in years."<p>"She knows, Ryoga." the person across the table said softly as she stood up and moved around to her newest son. "She knows that it was hard for her to be a good mother when she couldn't be home for you. When I talked to her, she agreed to this when she heard how you had grown up ever since she had seen you. She was happy that you would know where your mother was."<p>Theta mentally jumped at this information, something which made Ryoga's own eyes widen as Theta almost screamed the next question at him. Before he could ask, Nodoka waved his worry away.<p>"Don't worry, son. I didn't tell her about Theta. I don't think she would have agreed to this if she had."<p>Ryoga calmed down at this information, and he could feel Theta do the same. He had good reasons why he had to keep Theta secret from as many people as possible.<p>{Yes,} Theta totally agreed. {Avoiding and running away from people might be a great way to train in certain fields, but overall is too distracting when we want to do something else}<p>"What does Theta think about this?" his host-turned-mother asked.<p>"He's just relieved that no one knows about him beyond the few that need to know." he replied without thinking about the question she asked, catching the importance of it only after. As he was about to ask how she knew, she asked another question that put every other thought from his mind.<p>"And what about the adoption?"<p>"Well," he began, "Something about me being your son gave him a shock. He came out of it when he heard about you talking about me to my, uh, mother, and he's been quiet since."<p>"Ah." Nodoka said in an understanding way as she stood in front of him, her motherly smile warm with affection. "And you?"<p>"I . . .I . . . don't know." he finished lamely.<p>"Do you want to know why/"<p>Ryoga nodded dumbly.<p>"Because you have done so much for me for the last year and a half. You've been, in many ways, the son I never had. You're so manly, honorable, and such a gentleman. Any mother would love to have you as their son, and I know many girls will want you too."<p>Ryoga didn't blink an eye at her odd qualities she thought her son should have. Theta had warned him the first time he had talked to her, and he had become used to her ideas since. He had never thought of himself as such though.<p>{You just don't see it yourself. Her assesment is pretty good, and she is paying a great compliment when she says it. She's saying that you're a great martial artist. One that she has wished and prayed all these years Ranma will turn out to be.}<p>Then Ryoga felt something from Theta that was unexpected. For the first time since he knew him, Theta was scared.<p>{ Oh no!}<p>What?<p>[We forgot about Ranma! If he turns out to be far from how I know him, his mother might kill him!]<p>How . . . The contract!<p>{Exactly. And we might be a part of it now!}<p>"What's wrong?"<p>Ryoga focused on Nodoka, concern showing on her face in place of her usual smile.<p>"Do you remember about the contract you have with Gen . . .uh . . ."<p>"Don't worry if you don't call my husband father until later," she said. "What about the seppuku contract?"<p>"Does that apply to me as well?" Ryoga asked with dread.<p>The Saotome mother frowned in thought. "I guess it would, technically," she finally answered as she moved towards a secluded corner of the kitchen. "But I don't have any real need of it now."<p>Ryoga blnked at this, with Theta doing a mental equivalent seconds later. Then he asked the smartest question either could think of at the moment.<p>"Wha?"<p>"It's easy to see," she continued as she opened a drawer. "The contract says that my child has to be a 'man among men'. From what you've told me, he has effectively become this. Not only that, if Delta is anything like Theta, he is in good hands. So there is no longer a need for the contract on Ranma's behalf."<p>Ryoga visibly winced at the comment of Ranma being in good hands. I did tell her what really happened, right?<p>{Yes,} Theta replied. {She obviously thinks that what we told her isn't a truly bad thing for Ranma. Or at least she has convinced herself that it isn't. Either way, its probably best we don't dissuade her from that.}<p>"And in your case," she continued, not aware of the mental discussion going on behind her as she pulled something out, "You have shown yourself to be just like him in every way. Although it wasn't meant for you, you have fulfilled every reason for this contract. So I have no use for it anymore."<p>"Ah," Ryoga said simply, only understanding that the contract was no longer a worry when he saw it ripped in half, then thrown into the garbage. He simply sat down by the table, too many shocks in too short a time for him to handle. Nodoka turned to see her newest child staring at her, dumbstruck for some odd reason.<p>"What's wrong, Ryoga?"<p>"Nothing, nothing at all," he simply replied.<p>His new mother smiled a caring smile befre turning back to the drawer. When she returned to the table, she had a scroll and a letter in her hands, both which she handed to her son after she sat down.<p>"Here, I want you to have these," she said as he looked at the scroll. "Your father sent me this years ago for safe keeping."<p>What Ryoga saw made him gasp. Of all things he expected, Mrs... mother just gave him what he had originaly came for.<p>{I'm surprized she knew what it was,} Theta said.<p>Ryoga thought he seemed a little unsettled as he read the moves for the Yamakensen.<p>{I've only read this technique in parts,} his guest answered the unasked question. {In the story I know, your...mother...used the scroll to make letters with them. But something has changed drastically now.}<p>How so?<p>{In the story I am familiar with, Mrs. Saotome started using the scroll for letters only months after she received it from her husband. She doen't write long letters, and very few in the many years she has been seperated from Ranma, but some of the scroll should have been used. This scroll is complete.}<p>Maybe us being here was enough to change things?<p>{Maybe.}<p>"Also, I want you to meet a certain family soon. . ."<p>-<p>"So why did it take a month to get here?" Nabiki asked for the group, all wanting the whole story.<p>"Well, I had to learn the moves first," Ryoga answered easily. He set the cup Kasumi had given him and her family earlier in the night. She went to add more tea, but stopped when thier guest put a hand up to say he was done.<p>"And that took you only a month to do?" The sarcasm almost dripped from her voice. "I can't see how anyone can learn all the moves in that time-frame."<p>"A martial artist can do anything if they put their mind to it," Soun quoted. Then ruined the wise atmosphere moments later with the question, "How did you learn everything in a month?"<p>"I learned to do the moves; I haven't perfected them yet. No one can perfect several techniques in a month, even with help like mine."<p>{And running into him didn't help you train either.}<p>That's something they don't need to know.<p>{Yet, at least.}<p>"In any case, I'd better go to bed soon."<p>"Oh my, it's pretty late." Kasumi fretted.<p>"Yeah, some of us have school in the morning," her sister drawled.<p>"And some of us need to continue practising too," was Ryoga's reply. "Thank you, Kasumi. The tea was refreshing."<p>The Tendo sister in question blushed slightly and mumbled some sort of reply before quickly grabbing the cups. nabiki scowled at her sister's response to the praise given to her, and put another black mark on her sister's fiancee's list before she followed Ryoga upstairs.<p>-<p>"Akane, it's time."<p>The girl in question looked away from the mirror to see her father, dressed in a tuxedo, at the door. His face was wet from all the tears that had run down his face ths morning alone. Grabbing a cloth, she brought it over to her father, gently drying his eyes with it before tucking it in his breast pocket for later use. His grip was gentle when he came up and took her hand.<p>"I never though I'd see the day my little girl got married," he said, eyes gentler than she had seen in many years. He always acted so gruff and unconcerned, but it was a mask for the outside world; even his closest friend never saw him like this. These were the eyes of a father first before all else. "Are you ready?"<p>"Yes, it seems I have waited years for this day, father," Her eyes were close to crying too. She had waited so long for it, and today she would have her dream.<p>Soun brought out the same cloth she had given him and wiped her eyes before setting the veil on her head, an honor he had asked for days before.<p>"This is your future, your destiny. You were chosen, and you accepted. Do you have any regrets?"<p>The question sounded odd, but her father was emotionally strung. Under the conditions, he had wanted to ask if everything was alright, and it came out not the way he wanted, her mind supplied.<p>"No. I wouldn't want to be with anyone different."<p>Her father held out his arm as she looked one last time in the mirror. It was her future. And her present.<p>-<p>The guests stood as she passed through the large wooden doors. Friends and former rivals all watched in respectful silence as the blushing bride walked at a slow pace down the red carpet. Faces her mind supplied names for pebbled the crowd, some she knew well, some whom she hadn't seen in years, others she had only passing acquaintances with.<p>She was told what it would feel like when she walked the last few paces by those who had gone before her. Butterflies, stirring the last few days, woke in her stomach with the need to move and explore the outside boundaries of their world. A throat that seemed to be drier than stretches of desert, even though it had absorbed water not that long ago. A walk that was longer than the hardest marathon she had ever ran, one that could leave her short of breath soon after.<p>But, most importantly, love, a pure feeling of devotion for the person waiting for her at the begining of something new and unblemished.<p>She smiled gently as she gave her father a kiss on his cheeck before he moved to the side, letting her husband-to-be take both of her hands into his. A smile of strong affection was written all about his face, from the softness in his eyes to the small smile he wore. He was nervous today; there were only a few times since she had met him that he had been nervous to be with her.<p>As they kneeled down together, the priest began the ceremony simply. He didn't preach to the crowd about blessings or praises or virtues, but about hardship.<p>"Everyone, we are gathered here today to see two people exchange vows of matrimony. They embark on a journey that will be one of sorrow, pain, and horror. They have seen the worse of each other; their short-comings, their suffering, and their strife. Thier lives will be an endless trial that may not hold no boundaries, no limitations, of loneliness and misery even while together."<p>"But within these trials is a thread that attaches these two souls, that creates a bond no sorrow or hatred can shred. These two have found within themselves a strength that will see them through days they struggle through rough waters, and will always lead them straight through the deepest darkness."<p>"Friends, we are here to celebrate the strength these two share, a thread of care, trust, and love for one another to bypass  boundaries. Two souls merged as one to be inseperate for infinity."<p>The priest looked down at the kneeling couple, he watched the two stare into each other's eyes, unaffected by his speech of what was to come. They were willing to go through eveything together. He turned to motion for the rings.<p>Kasumi came over at the priest's gesture, holding an opened box with a wedding ring inside. Holding it out for her youngest sister to pull out, she moved back as the ring went on the grooms hand.<p>"I, Akane, swear my undying love for you, on this day," she said, with no hesitation. Butterflies, content before to stay in the recesses of her stomach, found their way up towards her chest. But she found the strength to continue. "I will be at your side, through all measures of pain, suffering, and hardship that will come. This, I swear to you, on this day. I will never leave you, never to part from your side, even after death. This, I swear to you, on this day. With this ring, I take you as my husband, now, forever, never-ending."<p>She never took her eyes away from his, barely blinking as she said words they had agreed upon before. Their vows were those spoken many times, sometimes unspoken, but always heartfelt. His eyes never looked away from hers, except when it was his turn to place a ring on her finger. Taking the offered ring, he slid the band onto her left ring finger as he said his vows.<p>"i, Ryoga, swear my undying . . . "<p>-<p>Akane's eyes opened to blackness. It took her moments to register why everything seemed dark and grey. Her mind soon supplied an answer that was satisfactory for her.<p>It's late at night or eary morning. She was in her bed, sleeping until a few seconds ago. She was safe, secure, comfortable. There was no threat she need to deal with immediately. She could sleep a few hours before needing to be  school. . .<p>Of course, after almost half an hour, she gave up trying to sleep in frustration. She knew why she couldn't sleep; it was that dream that kept her awake. She had half a mind to go over to Ryoga and bash him on the head, just on the principle of it. Nevermind that it was the middle of the night.<p>She didn't act on the impulse. Who knew what that . . . boy . . . would do. Maybe destroy another piece of furniture while he was at it.<p>But the dream had been so . . . real. Everything was the way she had wanted for her wedding, down to the seed pearls and white slippers that went with her wedding dress.<p>But she had no intentions of marrying some . . . pervert!<p>Idly, she wondered what Dr. Tofu would look like if he was the one she would marry. The thought of the doctor kneeling down with her brought a small blush to her face, and stopped herself when her 'daydream' took her into the realm of the honeymoon. Her blush at that thought almost made her whole face red, although the smile she wore was a particularily naughty looking one.<p>Slowly, her blush faded and the smile went away. Dr. Tofu wouldn't marry her, he was in love with Kasumi. He was nuts over Kasumi. He treated her like he did everyone else, a well-known patient, a friend occasionally, but nothing else.<p>So could that dream be true?<p>Uh-uh. No way. There was no way she would be even seen with that . . . that pervert! He and her father hadn't even asked if she wanted to get engaged. And the boy had a voice in his head! One that knew her secrets! And almost told them in front of her family! He was as bad as any other boy out there!<p>So even if he was nice to her, or didn't complain when she cooked last night?<p>He was a boy. He was probably waiting for her to think he was nice, THEN reveal his true self.<p>Really?<p>Completely.<p>Turning on her side, Akane refused to think of her problem, even though a part of her was still was not convinced.<p>-<p>Nabiki also was thinking before she went to bed. Ever since the day Ryoga had came to their home, she had thought she needed to be careful about the person inside Ryoga. She had assumed that he knew them inside and out, and Ryoga was a party to that information as well. But his story tonight had confirmed something she suspected ever since the day he refused to go inside the school yards.<p>Mentally, she cursed herslf for being played as a sucker, something she didn't like to admit. She had delayed in selling the information to everyone at school for too long. Information like this was like any other item; it had a shelf-date, and, once it passed, wasn't good any longer. She needed to sell it while it would give her a decent price. Kuno-baby himself would buy this easily for ten thousand yen.<p>Doing some quick mental calculations, she smiled at what she would rake in, even at the least projected numbers.<p>As for Ryoga's little secret, she was sure he would be willing to buy her silence. Since he was so willing to blackmail her, even if it wasn't even an idle threat on his part, she had no problem of returning the favor, except that it would be crystal clear that it was, in fact, a threat. His one true weak spot, his only chink in his armor, was his fear of everyone knowing about Theta, and what might happen to him if people in general found out. She had all intentions of  to her end, and Theta might even be convinced to tell the outcomes of certain events that she could take advantage of as well.<p>But she had to do one better. She was absolutely sure that he had known she would hesitate to tell people about him, just because she thought he had her over the barrel. Now that she knew better, her pride refused to be bested by someone who was as psycho as his brother.<p>A small smile came to her face as an idea came to her. She knew what she would do, and contacting the person would be simple. She would phone one of her poeple in the morning to stop by a certain place with a message. Then she would let her loose on Ryoga.<p>-<p>Ranma looked out at the full moon shining brightly in the field of stars. It didn't matter where he went, they were one of he few things that didn't change in the world.<p>{Philosophical tonight, are we?}<p>Ranma's small smile turned into a sneer as the parasite in his head finally decided to talk to him.<p>{Why should I? You haven't listened to me in months. And you said you never wanted to hear from me again.}<p>Then shut up. I don't want anything to do with you, unless you'll let me remember those moves.<p>{No can do, Ranma. Those fighting styles are Japanese of origion. You can't know them for obvious reasons.}<p>Fine, be that way. You can't stop me from getting the freak, or those scrolls and items he has. Those are all Chinese.<p>{Actually, only a few are,} the voice said. {Do you really think Happosai didn't take scrolls and items from Japan?}<p>Ranma's response was far from polite.<p>{Don't yell at me for telling you the truth.}<p>Well, it doesn't matter anyway. Sit back and enjoy the show...Delta...because I'll show you what I've learned on my own these last two years.<p>{And what you can do through under-handed moves. Oh, and don't let me forget...}<p>Ranma tuned out the pig-boy as he went on one of his usual rants about morality and the like. His eyes fell on Shampoo as she rested, tired from the last session he had with her. She was his wife, after all.<p>{How can you treat your wife that way? What happened to everything your father drilled into you about honor and respect?}<p>You happened. Pops got what he deserved.<p>{And her? She didn't do anything to you.}<p>She would've. I remember that much, among other things. Now shut up and leave me alone.<p>{If you want me to, fine. But don't expect me to stop just because of you.}<p>Ranma ignored him, watching as Shampoo slowly settled down to sleep. He wanted her to rest a bit before she had more fun with him.<p>-<p>In the city limits, a boy also traveled, searching for a certain martial artist. He was, to put it mildly, pissed. He had had a chance to finally learn the other school that was similar to his own, and he had lost it. Now, he had to track him down and demand a rematch. The scroll was the only thing he was ble to salvage those many years ago, and it was a personal momento from his father.<p>Foget honor. Forget self-respect. He would do anything to get his hands on what was his by right. On both, since he was the only natural son, thus the only legitamite heir, to the techniques.<p>-<p>Outside of Tokyo, a person slept in a sleeping bag by the embers of a dying fire. Her camping supplies were placed rather neatly around her, with whatever wasn't needed for the morning already stored away. A kerchief she had worked on before sleeping was between her pillow and the bag, a half-finished embroidered pig on one corner. She was obviously deep asleep, and dreaming of who might become her husband as she traveled, even though she had no idea who it might be yet.<p>Hidden in the surrounding bushes, her prize pet rested, its snout catching all wafts that came near its owner. It woke quietly, catching the smell of something it might have to fight off, but fell asleep again after the minimal threat left.<p>-<p>Near the shores of Japan, a form emerged from a small hot spring nestled in the hills. He wore a green Chinese outfit with a serpent on the front, and wore a peculiar brown scarf around his neck. Passing his hand once through his hair, the young man smiled as he looked inland. The one eye not covered by a black patch focused on the lights coming from one of towns near Tokyo.<p>"So, Saotome, where have you gone to now?" he wondered out loud before walking towards the town. Turning into his other form wouldn't help get directions to Nerima, after all.<p>-<p>Heh heh. I'll leave it there. I've pretty much confirmed some suspicions on who the voices are in this chapter, and most of the story behind that will be explained soon. Sorry for those who were waiting for an update to this story. This month gave me almost no time to sit down and write. I promise there will be more than back-story in the next chapter.<p>'Til then<p>blue_scarf_
