Any resemblence to other characters or stories, unless specified, are unintentional.<p>Chapter 1<p>- - -<p>Here is a familiar scene. A foggy day in the streets of Nerima. It had just rained several minutes ago, and cold water is pooled all over. People walk along, not thinking anything out of the ordinary.<p>One person walks alone down the street. He has a destination in mind, and is walking towards it with determination along the road. A biker drives by him, biking through a puddle and splashing water at everything nearby. Some of it falls onto the man walking down the street, the person who will be the center of the story.<p>What do we expect to happen? An instant change into a cat, or a pig, or a duck, or a panda? Or maybe the boy changes into a girl?<p>Nope. All that happens is he curses the biker.<p>"How dare he mess with the likes of..."<p>{Calm down} a voice said. {He didn't plan to splash you. Let it be, we have to get there soon.}<p>"Yeah, yeah," the person responded out loud.<p>The traveler soggedly made his way along the road, walking at a pace that ate the ground fast, but was more a casual walk than a purposeful step. He turned at a corner, stopped, and slowly rotated left until he looked down the way he was originally facing. He took a cautious step forward, then another. Then he continued walking at the previous pace before he had come to the corner. Shifting his backpack, which had miraculously escaped his clothes' fate, he continued on. He walked down the street until the voice soundedn his head again.<p>{Here,} he said. {Turn to your left.}<p>The boy turned. He looked at the brick wall with uncomprehension. This was their destination?<p>{You turned the wrong way.}<p>Oh. He turned the same direction again. It was the street he had come down.<p>{One more time.} the voice seemed to say with a sigh.<p>Confused, he turned to the right again to see what had made the voice so anxious to be here.<p>-<p>Soun sat at the table, re-reading the words on a postcard with a black pig on the front.<p>"Sending son soon, huh?" he mused. "I thought Genma would've come with the boy, but no matter. Kasumi!"<p>"Yes, father?" answered the eldest daughter, coming out of the kitchen at the sound of her name.<p>-<p>"Nabiki!"<p>The person in question looked up from the magazine she was reading to see her father at the doorway to her room. He had a postcard in his hand and looked happy about something.<p>-<p>"Akane!"<p>Soun opened the door to his youngest daughter's room, only to see that there was no one inside.<p>"Now where is that girl?" he asked himself.<p>-<p>Akane Tendo readied herself to break the bricks with her hand. As she brought her hand up, she gave a yell before bringing it down and destroying the bricks. "Whew, what a workout." she said.<p>Nabiki watched at the dojo door as her youngest sister destroyed the unoffending concrete. A piece of rubble bounced her way, and was stopped when she put a foot over it. "Here you go again, Akane. This is what makes the boys think you are so weird."<p>"So what," the youngest sister replied. "Why should I care, Nabiki? Not everyone thinks the whole world revoles around... around... boys."<p>After she had finsihed, the elder sister said "No, well I guess this wouldn't interest you. Akane, father wants to talk to all of us about something."<p>-<p>The three Tendo daughters sat side by side, from oldest to youngest, across the table from their father. Kasumi wore her usual outfit, Nabiki had quickly put on a kimono after fetching Akane, and the youngest Tendo was still in her training outfit.<p>"Fiance?" Kasumi asked.<p>Soun was looking out at the pond in the backyard, watching the fish jump into the air briefly before flopping back into the water.<p>"Yes," he replied. "He is the son of a very close friend of mine. If one of you girls were to marry him, and continue on this training hall, then the Tendo legacy would be secured."<p>"Hey, wait a minute here," Akane replied. "Don't we get to have a say in who we are going to marry?"<p>"Maybe you should wait to meet him." Nabiki said, smirking at Akane. "You never know, he may be cute, right Daddy?"<p>Soun laughed at the question, then sobered up before saying "He'll be here any minute. He and his father have been on a training mission for the last ten years. Recently they had gone to China."<p>"Oooh, China." Nabiki said.<p>"So they went all the way to China. Big deal." Akane muttered.<p>"Father, how old is he?" Kasumi asked, which started the tirade of questions and comments.<p>"Is he cute?"<p>"Younger men are so. . . . young."<p>"What kind of guy is he?"<p>"Do you know his name?"<p>Soun chuckled at the enthusiastic behaviour of his children. Then, as he sobered up, replied "I don't know."<p>This shocked the three sisters. Nabiki was the first to respond with the expectant "You don't know?"<p>"I've never met him. I don't know his name to start with." Their father replied honestly.<p>The two older sisters looked at their father with unbelieving stares. Akane looked away in disgust.<p>"Oh please, I can't believe this." she thought.<p>Silence echoed through the house for a brief moment, only disturbed by someone knocking on the door.<p>"It sounds like we have visitors," Kasumi stated.<p>Oooh, That must be him." Nabiki said, running to the door, followed closely by her father. They returned shortly with a boy in tow, pushing him down at the table opposite of the sisters.<p>"He is cute," Nabiki said, smiling again at Akane. Her response was typical.<p>"He's probably like all other boys." she responded, glaring at the boy before facing away.<p>"Now, now." Soun gently admonished his daughter before turning to the boy. "So what's your name?"<p>"Ryoga. Ryoga Saotome," the boy replied simply. He looked at how the sisters reacted to his presence. "Sorry about this..."<p>At the mention of the family name, Soun grabbed the boy into a hug and started crying.<p>"Oh father." Kasumi sighed.<p>-<p>After the Tendo patriarch was done with his crying, the three sisters looked at the boy across from them, all thinking different thoughts.<p>"Oh my."<p>"I should ask father to be the one to marry him."<p>"He's nothing but another one of those perverts."<p>Ryoga watched the three appraise him like a side of beef for sale. He was currently having a mental debate in his mind.<p>{Its going to be the one on the right,} the voice told him.<p>But the middle girl seemed to like him...<p>{Wait until they hear everything. The two girls are going to choose her to be your fiance.}<p>He didn't want to get engaged in the first place.<p>{I never expected you to be a Saotome either. Since we have no choice, we might as well do it. It doesn't matter anyway. Also, he wouldn't expect it.}<p>Didn't he have enough advantages?<p>{This isn't for your rival. This is for mine.}<p>Why?<p>"So, tell me, when did you get back from China?" Soun said, breaking the silence between the respective parties.<p>"I . . . never went to China." Ryoga said, turning to the parent.<p>"But my friend Genma. . ."<p>". . . took his son Ranma to China. I was adopted into the family." he finished.<p>Soun stopped talking with this revelation. Nabiki and Kasumi blinked at this news. Akane continued to frown.<p>Ryoga looked at the family looking back at him, for the most. Sighing, he decided to tell the whole story, despite what would happen.<p>{Yeah, its for the best,} the voice agreed.<p>"Let me tell you something, I've been through hell because of Ranma Saotome. But it would be fair that you knew everything he and I have endured."<p>-<p>A young Ryoga Hibiki readied himself to go out the door and to the vacant lot for his fight with Ranma. He had spent the last several weeks pounding the picture of his enemy glued onto a stuffed bag. Now, the day of the fight was here. Ryoga was pumped and ready. Looking at the image angain, he yelled at the picture that he was coming for him, then took a step outside his room. After a couple hours of wandering around his home, he finally found the front door. As he stepped into the street, Ryoga turned and ran forward. He missed the corner which would have taken him to the lot behind his house, and had all intentions of running in the one direction all day.<p>"Ranma Saotome, today is the day I shall beat you!"<p>Idiot. Ranma isn't this way, a voice said.<p>"What?" Ryoga asked, coming to a complete halt as he looked for the source of the voice. Seeing no one, he assumed he was imagining it.<p>If you were imagining it, then why did I say that your oppenent is back the way you came?<p>"Who's there?" the Lost Boy said, turning from side to side in an attempt to locate the direction the voice came from.<p>Don't bother trying to find me. I'm talking to you from your mind.<p>"Huh?"<p>Do you need it spelled out? Alright, I'll tell you directly. I found myself suddenly looking at something that didn't make sense to me. I recognized Ranma's picture, but didn't undertand how I ended up doing so. Then I heard you yell and the picture moved. Suffice to say, after the shock wore off, it didn't take long to figure out what was happening.<p>"What?"<p>Ok, you're a little more dense than I thought you were. Let me back up the truck abit. I know all about you and Ranma Saotome. I know what will happen to the two of you, between your lack of direction sense and his acting before thinking. This decision of yours, and your confidence that you don't need a week to find your own backyard, will trigger events that you or Ranma won't like one bit. I saw this immediately, and decided that it was best to nip the mistake in the bud.<p>"What mistake?"<p>I'll just say that it ends with you following Ranma for the next few years because you blame everything on him.<p>This last comment brought Ryoga back to himself. He was having a conversation with his mind. The experience was . . odd, to say the least.<p>{I am not your mind,} the voice said, obvious reading his host's thoughts. {I am a human being, somehow in your mind at the moment. And I agree on that last bit too. To think I actually. . . well, that's beside the point.}<p>"So what do we do now?" Ryoga asked, still talking out loud for some reason.<p>{Well, we can go talk to Ranma. Maybe meeting him before he leaves will be enough to change things.}<p>"What?"<p>The voice did its equivalent of a sigh. {From what I know, you would have ran aroung Japan for four days before finding the vacant lot. Ranma will have waited for three days and nights for you. I know he would've waited until you came back if his father hadn't dragged him away to continue his training journey.}<p>"That cad! I will make him pay for missing our fight!"<p>{Idiot. That will be in three days time. He's still waiting there at this moment, and won't be moving for a couple days. Lots of time to get back there.}<p>"Oh. . . "<p>{And stop answering me out loud. People are looking at you weird.}<p>Ryoga's eyes re-focused outward to see people gawking at him, thinking he might not be with all his nuts and bolts.<p>{Its one thing I found out, that I can see whatever your eyes are taking in, even if you aren't focused on it. Now, to get back where Ranma is, turn opposite of the way you're looking, and move forward.}<p>Why should I do what you say? I can't trust something I don't know.<p>{Fair enough point. Tell you what, for now, let's get back to where Ranma is. Get this out of the way, and then see where things go. Once again, you'll have to go back the way you came.}<p>Ryoga turned around quickly in what he thought was the direction he had came from.<p>{Idiot. Slowly turn to your right. I'll tell you when to stop turning}<p>Ryoga turned slowly, waiting for the mental command to stop. When it came, he saw his house down the street.<p>How did I get here? All I wanted was to get to the lot.<p>{Because you got lost, idiot. You took three steps out your door and lost any idea of where you were. I could FEEL you get lost within the fourth step.}<p>Will you stop calling me that! I'm not an idiot.<p>{. . . . . . . . All right, since we're going to have to work together, I'll stop calling you names. But I want you to listen to me when I say things, ok?}<p>Sure, for now.<p>{Agreed.}<p>With his mental companion, Ryoga slowly made his way to his destination.<p>-<p>When Ryoga arrived at the vacant spot, what he saw didn't seem out of place. The visitor in his mind was highly in disagreement.<p>Ranma was on his knees, clutching his head as if his mind was on fire. His face was an image of pure torture, eyes closed in immense pain, body shaking with the moans emitting out of his mouth. Egged by the voice in his head to do something, Ryoga acted instinctevly, running over to his self-proclaimed enemy to find out what was wrong.<p>Ranma's response was mumbled, although Ryoga made out enough of it to make him jolt back in shock.<p>He thinks he's going mad!<p>{Well, I would be too if I had another person's voice in my head.}<p>How do you think I feel?<p>{No insult implied, but you're willing to believe me because that was the explanation given to you. Everything I have said is true. but you do take things at face value without checking to see if all is what it seems.}<p>Ryoga didn't really pay attention past the first part, since the doubt of sincerity of the voice's story had just been planted.<p>{Look, I can probably prove some of my story true later. Right now, we need to help Ranma.}<p>Why should I?<p>{Because he will be important in your life. And you will be in his. Despite what changes have been made from your stories that I know, you and Ranma will be enemies, friends and competitors, but always rivals first and foremost. If things change too drastically, I won't be able to help you for however long I'm here.}<p>Him . . . me . . . forever rivals?<p>{The best kind, rivals who always test each others abilities to their maximum. Now, will you help me help him?}<p>Ryoga considered it briefly. A new wave of moans from the hurting Ranma seemed to tip the balance of his decision.<p>Alright, if only to stop his moaning and to find out more about you.<p>{Ok. Now, touch him. I'll be able to communicate with the other voice.}<p>Ryoga blinked at this information.<p>How do you know that?<p>{. . . . . . . good question. The idea came so crystal clear to me when I first saw Ranma in a heap that I didn't think why I would know this.}<p>So, should I?<p>{Yeah, do it.}<p>Ryoga slowly set a hand on the cringing Ranma. As he did, a floodgate opened in his mind. Somewhere, his mind was connected not to just one mind, but three minds together. One was the passenger he had briefly known that day. The two others were unknown to him. He could see a connection between the two strange minds, a conncetion that he formed with his passenger.<p>That last thought made him think that his guest hadn't truly introduced himself.<p>[Call me Theta.] The familiar voice responded.<p>[You can hear my thoughts here?] he asked.<p>Theta gave a mental nod to the question. [We can still share thoughts here privately. Also, me and the voice inside Ranma can apparently communicate too.]<p>[What about Ranma?]<p>The voice didn't respond immediately. It seemed to be preoccupied with another task. As Ryoga was about to get angry for ignoring him, the voice seemed to focus back on the Lost Boy.<p>[Ranma was having problems adjusting to the voice.] Theta said. [The voice, who we'll call Delta for now, was giving him too much information at once. He couldn't take the strain, and ended up the way he was when we arrived.]<p>[Too much information?]<p>[Hmmm, let's just say Delta was trying to make Ranma learn information he wasn't mentally ready for. He broke under the strain. He knows not to do it again, but I'm afraid it's too late to save Ranma as I know him.]<p>Ryoga didn't really understand all that, but got the impression things were very serious.<p>[Extremely serious. Ranma will recover, but he might not be the person he would have been. Alot of things have happened in the last eight years of his life, and he had been given a harsh look at reality with no sugar coating.]<p>[So, what about . . .]<p>[The fight? I was going to tell you about it. Me and the other voice want to give Ranma two years to recover. He will be in China those years, and he might be able to find what he needs there to be the way I know him. Delta will be there to guide him, but will retrain from flooding him with everything at once like he was doing before.]<p>[So what does . . .]<p>[During that time, Ranma will also be learning techniques to use in a fight that is scheduled for two years from now. You and Ranma'll meet here after those two years, and then you two can fight to your heart's content.]<p>[If Ranma will be in China, where will I go?]<p>[You and I will be learning techniques here in Japan. We've set the rule that any technique originating from one country can only be used by the rival training there. This includes me helping you learn techniques I know. How does that sound?]<p>Ryoga thought about it before agreeing. Theta was giving him a chance to train before fighting his opponent, that was all the incentive he needed..<p>[No, he's not just my opponent. He is my rival, just as I was told. I'll only think of him as such.]<p>[Well, its good to see the important thing isn't changing Theta said. [Alright, we'll disconnect from Ranma, and then we'll talk privately.]<p>-<p>"Ranma stopped moaning from the overload almost as soon as I stopped touching him," Ryoga continued. "He spent several hours recovering before he left the lot. Three days later, his father took him to China."<p>The four Tendos stared at their guest with different expressions on their face. Soun had the stunned surprize look, while Kasumi had a small frown on face. Nabiki wore her poker-face, although disbelief etched several corners of her expression. Akane's face was one of outright disgust.<p>"So you say that you have a voice in your head, that it can talk to you, and it will train you for your fight with your rival and brother in the upcoming future, who just happens to have a voice riding in his head too?" Nabiki had to ask for the group.<p>"Pretty much. Its in about a month, so I want to be ready for it." Ryoga answered without hesitation.<p>Stares toward the Saotome child at the matter-of-fact statement he had made dominated the room. Once again, the three sisters were thinking different thoughts.<p>"Oh my. . . "<p>"Maybe I don't want to be engaged with him. . . "<p>"He is a psychopath and a pervert."<p>Soun just looked in horror at the person who was to be his son-in-law. Even if he had Genma's other son here, a nut would be engaged to his daughter.<p>Ryoga knew all attention was on him; he was uncomfortable at the looks he was receiving.<p>{You just told them you heard voices without confirming it. Anyone would think you nuts and send you to a quackhouse.}<p>So what was to do?<p>{Give them information they would only know.}<p>"Look, I can prove that there is a voice in my head," Ryoga said, breaking the uneasy silence in the room. "Theta knows all about your family, and can tell you almost anything you would only know as an individual or as a family. He thinks this is the only way to show that I'm not crazy."<p>Nabiki perked at this. A challenge like this was suited to her tastes.<p>"Alright, Saotome. I'm game" she said.<p>Ryoga turned to look at her in the eyes.<p>"Nabiki Tendo, age 17. Attends Furinken High School. Has Tatewaki Kuno for a classmate. Known as the Ice-Queen of Furiken."<p>Nabiki kept her poker-face in check at this information. "Nothing anyone around town knows," she argued.<p>Ryoga smiled slightly. "You sell pictures of your younger sister to Kuno for money. Usually, you can make about 5000 yen per picture.<p>Akane glared at the paling middle sister. How dare she! She had sold pictures of her to Kuno? Kuno!<p>Her elder sister wasn't thinking about other things at the moment. This stranger had found out a secret her family hadn't known about, and that she had taken precautions for to make sure no one would find out. And he had left it as his ace to prove that he knew their personal lives.<p>The former Hibiki smiled at the expression the sister he had talked to pale as he repeated the information Theta told him. One down . . .<p>"Soun Tendo. Age 35. Married Kimiko Tendo 22 years ago. Widowed for ten years. Martial artist in the Land-based Anything-Goes Style of Martial Arts."<p>Yes, all true. . . " Soun started.<p>"Master was Happosai," Ryoga continued, "whom you and Genma sealed away 16 years ago during Akane's birth celebration."<p>The Tendo in question stared at the boy as if he had grown horms. He knew about . . . that?<p>"Kasumi, age 19. Homemaker, took over the chores and duties of the house after her mother passed away. Learned everything at her mother's side, but also had a notebook with the recipes in them, with minute descriptions of the ingredients and instructions. Has no need of it now, since she can cook all of them like her mother did."<p>The eldest sister smiled slightly at the compliment. Yes, she had done exactly that, but how had he known? Could what he say be true?<p>Ryoga finally looked at Akane. Theta, before almost mechanical about the information, seemed to hesitate before telling him anything. When he did, it seemed to be filled with affection, of all things.<p>"Akane. Age 16. Fights boys every day before school. Hates them because they want to beat her to go out with her. Wishes to be done with the lot of them, and boys in general. Thinks they are all perverts."<p>Akane sniffed at that. He knew it because he was a pervert himself.<p>"She grew her hair long for a specific reason."<p>The youngest Tendo sat up in surprize at this. How could he know?<p>"When she was young, she had a crush on a certain person. She still does today."<p>God, no, she thought, he does know. How could he?<p>"She thought growing her hair would catch his attention. She . . ."<p>"Ah! No!" Akane yelled, wanting him to stop before her secret came out.<p>Ryoga waited for her to bring her attention back to him. When she did, he looked at the family, turning to each one at a time.<p>"Have I proven that I know more than I should?"<p>Soun was the first to recover from the shock. He looked at the boy with a higher degree of respect. He did know them well, he had to admit.<p>"Yes, it's all well if you know this," he said, "but all that could be common knowledge."<p>Show us proof of something we wouldn't know; Ryoga thought to himself. Fortunatly, Theta was prepared for this challenge.<p>"Kasumi, do you know where that recipe book is?" he asked.<p>Kasumi frowned slightly. "Oh, no," she responded, "I had lost it years ago, after I had mastered most of Mother's recipes."<p>"So you would have no idea where it is?"<p>"Yes, why?"<p>Tell me, if I were to find it within, say, the next five minutes, would that be convincing enough to believe my story?"<p>Nabiki thought quickly. He was confident he could find a lost item in such a short time. He did know where it was or was bluffing. She decided to call. Soun was of a similar mind. If he could do it, he would at least be willing to concede he did have some source of information. Kasumi just thought how wonderful it would be to have the notebook again, after all these years.<p>Akane doubted he could do it.<p>-<p>Ryoga ddin't wait for a response; he stood up and waited for directions to its location. Slowly, he walked down the hall back to the stairs going to the second floor. After a slow rotation that ended with him pointed in the direction he needed, Ryoga followed the direction to go up the stairs and to turn the corner. Naturally, the whole family, including Akane, followed him, bunched into a group a distance behind their guest. Turning in the right direction for once, Ryoga then made his way to the storage room. Opening the door, he flicked the light on and moved directly to a box on the bottom shelf. Ryoga pulled out on the box from underneathe the shelves and brought it to the middle of the room. The Tendos silently surrounded the box, and, at a wave of his hand, Kasumi was invited to open it. The box was filled with various items that were owned by their mother, momentos held onto for sentimental value. On the top of the items was a book that Kasumi instantly recognized. Gently picking up her mother's notebook, she held it close to her cheeck, memories of the times spent in the kitchen when she was young coming back to her.<p>Nabiki was impressed. Ryoga had found the book in less than three minutes. He knew exactly where it was, and hadn't wasted a movement in getting there. And that he had found momentos that wouldn't be lost by the family for awhile hadn't been lost on her either. By the looks of it, Kasumi was won over as well, the way she smiled as she held the prized possession. A part of her mind not emotionally wrecked gave the off-hand thought that, if he did know what would more or less happen, he could help her make lots of money. Both sisters thought marriage sounded nice all of a sudden.<p>Her father didn't need to express his feelings. Tears running down his face were enough evidence that he was worse off than his elder daughters as memories lost for so many years came back to him. This boy was willing to help his family like this for no more gain than to show that he was telling the truth. He had no doubts about the engagement now.<p>Akane was the only one of the family with-holding judgeent. Yes, he had given the family precious treasures lost for years for little personal gain, but he was a boy. Boys weren't to be trusted.<p>The one person not part of the family watched from the corner. He didn't smile because he had met his claim, or that he felt the joy the family was feeling. He smiled because he could tell a few others didn't think him insane.<p>{It's still a small list.}<p>But it was longer now.<p>{True.}<p>-<p>A few hours later, everyone was sitting back at the dining table, once again Soun and Ryoga sitting across from the three sisters. The distinguishable difference, other than the color of the sky, was what the three sisters wore.<p>Kasumi had her formal kimono on, instead of her dress and apron she had worn earlier that day. Nabiki still wore the kimono she had on, but was wearing it formally, rather than loosly on her shoulders. Akane didn't have a kimono of any sort on; she had changed from her work-out clothes to a sun dress she favored.<p>Ryoga stared nervously at the three sisters. He knew what the two older sisters were wanting, and it involved him.<p>[Relax. You have the choice of who to choose as your fiancee,} Theta said confidentally.<p>Easy for you to say. You don't have formallly-attired girls eyeing you up.<p>{Technically, they are eyeing me up too. They know about me, and are slightly wary of that fact.} The voice to on an amused tone for a moment. {Also, I know that look from when I was being appraised too. Trust me, it doesn't get better with time.}<p>Ryoga sighed at that information. No help from that source. Guess he would have to do it himself.<p>Before he could say something, Soun put a hand on his shoulder. The patriarch had speculated at his daughters' attire, and had seen the nervous look his son-to-be was giving back. He had waited for any of his daughters to ask permission to marry him, but none had asked as of yet.<p>Truthfully, Nabiki wasn't wanting to go through with the engagement, now that she had time to rationalize everything. Yes, he could be a money-maker for her, but there were so many unknowns about him, not to mention the voice he called Theta occupying his head. The only reason she didn't truly back out was that her pride wouldn't allow it. If she was chosen, she would do it. Who knew, maybe something would happen.<p>Kasumi was willing to go through with it. He was young for her, but he was so nice, and kind. He had given her family a treasure of memories, and she felt that he needed to be paid for that, even if he didn't ask for it. Kasumi had nothing to offer of value in return other than herself. So she was willing to be his bride.<p>Akane had no interest in being his fiancee, and had all intentions to let her sisters fight over him.<p>"Son," Soun started, "You know my three daughters. Choose one to be your bride."<p>Ryoga sweated. What could he do?<p>{Choose Akane.}<p>What!<p>{You heard me. I know all three well. Nabiki is in it for money, Kasumi is willing because she feels indebted to you. You haven't won Akane over. If you choose her, you will be free from bad relationships with the other two and can start winning her over in one move.}<p>She doesn't want to be engaged.<p>{I told you before, Akane will be your fiance, right? I'll tell you this; even with the changes made from the story as I know it, Akane will still share ties with you.}<p>So?<p>{So, eventually, even if you choose one of the other sisters, you will find yourself engaged to Akane. Its the one fact I know.}<p>Are you sure?<p>{Positive. Don't worry about the other two sisters. They will be alright.}<p>"Mr. Tendo, I've made my decision," Ryoga said. He pointed a finger at Akane. "Akane Tendo, I want you to be my bride."<p>Kasumi's heart jumped at the announcement. He had chosen her youngest sister over her. Although she felt heart-broken, a part of her felt relief at not being picked. Nabiki frowned slightly. She could feel the potential money she could've made fly away.<p>Akane was surprized. And angry. Her first action at hearing the news was to grab the table, lift it in the air, and pound Ryoga with it. Or at least try to.<p>Ryoga, warned by Theta, had rolled out of range of the object as his new father-in-law crawled to the side. A noise to his side indicted he had missed the blow, and sat back up. That's when he saw Akane swing the table sideways at him. Without hesitation, he swung a fist at the table.<p>"Futae no Kuwami!" he yelled, punching the wood with his fist.<p>The table burst into slivers, raining sawdust onto the mats. Akane looked the piece of wood left in her hand. How had he done that?<p>"Please, don't try that agian," Ryoga asked.<p>-<p>This probably won't be a long story chapter-wise, with the last or second-last chapter the fight between Ranma and Ryoga.<p>Futae no Kiwami comes from Rurouni Kenshin series. How Ryoga learned about it will be one of several things I will clear up in the next chapter.<p>Thanks to Mark Caldera, Ming, and Zsych, whose suggestions and ideas I took into consideration while final editing this.<p>Also thanks to OmegaDL50 who gave his two cents about this story.<p>'Til then.<p>blue_scarf_
