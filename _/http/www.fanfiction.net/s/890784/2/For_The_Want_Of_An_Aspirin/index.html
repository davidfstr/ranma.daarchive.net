</div><p>*Disclaimer*</p><p>This Fic  is a crossover of Ranma ½ with Grandia and Sailor Moon there will also be  elements of Grandia 2 and maybe a few other things please note that I own none  of these, I'm just borrowing them, Thank you.</p><p>*AU warning*</p><p>The Grandia universe is going to be an AU and is  going to suffer from some cross contamination from Ranma entering it, some main  characters will change that's what Ranma does to people and places.</p><p>(Music: Metallica – The Struggle Within)</p><p><b>For The Want Of An Aspirin </b></p><p><b>Chapter 1 </b></p><p><b>The Bitch is Back</b></p><p>Setsuna resisted the urge to  smirk at Ranma as he was held in place at the center of the transport circle,  now glowing a near blinding blue.</p><p>She hadn't been all that  sure that this would work, as it wouldn't be the first time someone shrugged  off spells such as the simple "stay put" enchantment laid on the couch Ranma  was on. Luckily, it seemed that Ranma was unable to work his way through the  magical binding wrought around him.</p><p>Just as Setsuna was about to  leave for another room to wait for her former teacher to arrive, she felt a  massive rush of power from the center of the room... right where Ranma was.</p><p>Quickly glancing up she  spotted something that filled her with a feeling of dread.</p><p>Where once was seated the  martial artist was now a cocoon of ebony power.</p><p>Setsuna's mind was racing  trying to work out what had happened.</p><p>Nothing like this had ever  been shown in the Gates, in most lines Ranma lived for another year or two  before dieing of unknown causes. In the few that he didn't, the world was  plunged into darkness as Usagi failed somewhere along the road to Beryl's  defeat.</p><p>Setsuna was wrenched from  her train of thought by the magical equivalent of a sonic boom. Her eyes shot  up just in time to see the cocoon, the couch, and worst of all, the table that  held the items she was keeping in storage for her teacher, flicker and vanish  from this realm. Moreover, from the feel of the trace energies it was not to  the world she had picked out for Ranma to live out the rest of his days.</p><p>'Note to self maybe that was  a bad idea.'</p><p>This was the first thought  to pass through Ranma's mind just before he blacked out.</p><p>'Huh guess this means I'm  still alive, wonder why it's so dark though'</p><p>While he may be aware now  that doesn't mean he's firing with all pistons.</p><p>'Oh right eyes still closed,  hmm wonder what's cooking, smells good.'</p><p>Though it would appear  Ranma's nose and stomach are working fine... not that much of a surprise  really.</p><p>As Ranma's eyes opened, he  saw that while there was light most of where he was look little different from  the black void he was in before he opened them.</p><p>The light however appeared  to be a campfire, cooking over which was what appeared to be the biggest,  meanest ca-ca-ca... uh, one of those, in all of existence. And tending the fire  was... 'Huh, what the.' Ranma's cursed form with a rather foreboding set of  black wings formed from energy much like that contained inside the egg Ranma  had been examining.</p><p>Just as he was about to try  to find out what was going on, the twin of his cursed form's head shot up and  smirked.</p><p>"Well Ranma, it's good that  your finally awake. This is almost done cooking and it would have been a shame  if you had missed out"</p><p>For a  few moments Ranma sat dumbfounded because whoever this was they seemed to know  more about him then he was comfortable with. Ranma shook his head trying to get  his thoughts in order before he setting about coming up with a coherent  question to ask.</p><p>"Uhm who, what, umm."</p><p>As you can see, he didn't  quite manage it.</p><p>"Heh not too talkative right  now are you, don't worry you'll work it out, but first off, who and what have  the same answer... you see before you the magnificence that is the Wings of  Valmar, greatest and most powerful manifestation of Valmar's might."</p><p>The only response this  provoked was a rather pained look and a bead of sweat running down the back of  Ranma's head.</p><p>'Great, just great another  one who talks about herself in the third person, and worst of all she's  sounding a bit to much like a Kuno to be healthy, why me.'</p><p>"Hmm not biting eh, well I  suppose I should explain where we are, what I want, and what's in it for you."</p><p>Still getting not much more  then a blank look, she sighed and forged on, hoping he was more talkative  normally.</p><p>"Where we are is simple,  we're in your mind in a place commonly called the Dreamscape. Basically it's a  representation of your subconscious."</p><p>Seeing the blank look this  drew she scowled and tried again</p><p>"Where in a Dream ok, got  that...? Good."</p><p>"What I am, that's harder to  explain, hmmm I suppose you could say I'm a manifestation of darkness that was  used as a weapon by some people long ago, that basically came alive and created  a life for itself."</p><p>"You're my something  thousand times removed grandson or something like that or at least your the  thousand something times removed grandson of my last host a lady called  Millenia. Millenia ended up falling for a guy named Ryudo a Geo Hound, nice  enough guy if a little withdrawn. He, Millenia and another girl name Elena  spent a lot of time doing many things that have little impact on what's  happening now, suffice to say they meet, traveled together and fell in love.</p><p>"After a few adventures  Ryudo, Elena, and Millenia settled down, had children as couples in love often  do, and died together, old and in their bed… Well except Millenia she went out  in a blaze of glory and destruction a few days after her love's death so she  could join them in the afterlife."</p><p>"As time went by their  children had children, who in turn had children all the way to you father who  married you mother and had you."</p><p>"In some of those children  where sealed parts of Valmar, in your father case it was the tongue. Yeah in  his case it wasn't sealed so good."</p><p>The girl sighed and leaned  back looking up with a thoughtful look on her face.</p><p>"Ok that's what I am, now to  what I want."</p><p>"There are two ways we can  do this, the first and the one I like least is I try to devour your soul and  take its place, that's what any of the other pieces would do. Nevertheless,  thanks to that Millenia incident, I have come to see that this is not always  the best Idea.</p><p>So the second way we can do  this is I merge with you, you in turn will pick up a few of my mannerisms and a  few tidbits of knowledge and I'll kind of rest in the back of your head  watching the show and maybe lending a hand every so often."</p><p>The girl... lets call her  Millenia to simplify things, looked at Ranma waiting for a response, after a  few minutes passed she seemed to remember something and slapped the side of her  head.</p><p>"Um oops, sorry about that."</p><p>She waived her hand and the  waves of electricity keeping Ranma awake and paralyzed faded from existence,  Ranma gave Millenia a dark look as he worked the stiffness from he muscles  before falling into what looked like deep contemplation for a few more minutes,  finally he shook himself seeming to have come to a decision.</p><p>"Umm so what exactly is that  you cooking anyway."</p><p>Millenia pealed her face  from the ebony ground and scowled at the innocent looking Ranma.</p><p>"Oh just something I found  wandering around, Hah taught it not to pick fights with the Wings of Valmar"</p><p>Ranma seemed to think on  this for a moment, before opening his mouth again.</p><p>"So, uhh why are you cooking  it then."</p><p>Millenia scrunched up her  face and looked at Ranma as if the answer should have been obvious. She then  sighed and started to cut strips of meat from the cooking beast and putting  them on two plates that had appeared from somewhere.</p><p>"Well duhh, it lost what  else was I supposed to do, leave it lying around to stink up the place?"</p><p>Handing the second plate to  Ranma before she started to eat, seeing Ranma's look of trepidation she  grumbled in disgust.</p><p>"Look it's perfectly safe."</p><p>Millenia had a bite to prove  this.</p><p>"See no harm, besides it  tastes good."</p><p>Ranma's face was twisted in  indecision, should he have some of the horrible beast (cat), or not?  Unfortunately Ranma inherited Genma's stomach, this made the argument a rather  short one, and before long Ranma was happily chewing his third helping.</p><p>While getting himself his  fourth helping he finally remembered that the girl hadn't answered his  question, so he decided to try again, though what good it would do no one knows  considering he had already eaten three servings.</p><p>"So do you have any idea  what this thing was other then something lurking about looking for a fight?"</p><p>Millennia's face scrunched  up in concentration as if she was trying to reach something far away without  touching it.</p><p>"Hmm, I think it was some  kind of cat demon lurking about in your subconscious. Called the Neko-ken of  all things, I mean really calling yourself the cats fist is just silly,  probably the lamest name I've ever come across."</p><p>'This coming from someone  who calls herself the Wings of Valmar is rather rich.'</p><p>Right now pale faced Ranma  was beginning to really wish he could keep his mouth shut, I mean really here  he was enjoying a meal and then he has to go and find out that what he's eating  is something that had caused him no end of trouble and almost killed him... You  know when he thought about it that way maybe this was not such a bad thing  after all.</p><p>Giving this line of thought  a little more attention, Ranma's face started to regain its color again.</p><p>"Though I have to admit even  it the thing did need some advice on name choice it did have some neat tricks,  not as good as the other parts of Valmar but not too shabby"</p><p>After saying that, Millenia then manifested a set of energy claws  and used them to carve the last of the meat from the glistening bones over the  fire.</p><p>Ranma seeing this got a  confused look on his face.</p><p>"Um how are you using the  Neko-ken, anyway?"</p><p>Millenia looked at Ranma  oddly for a moment before coming to a realization.</p><p>"Oh right sorry I forgot  that your new to this whole Valmar thing, Its like this, When one part of  Valmar defeats another the defeated part is absorbed into the host of the  victor, the victor then devours them and gains the powers."</p><p>Ranma looked slightly green  at this but forged on anyway.</p><p>"So what does this have to  do with you using the Neko-ken?"</p><p>"Well its like this, this  Neko-ken thing is a form of Demonic possession, not the worst you could come  across, since it just shares space and energy rather then trying to destroy or  steal your soul, but it hides in the same place the pieces of Valmar rest.</p><p>This means that its  competition, just like another piece of Valmar. After all there's only so much  space in anything and two is company three is more then a crowd and adding me  to you and it would not be workable, so we fought, it lost and I ate it... well  we ate it anyway."</p><p>Ranma tried to ignore the  rather grisly delight that the girl was taking in the fact that he had also  been a party to the consumption of the Neko-ken and tried to get to the  important part.</p><p>"So does that mean that I  could use the Neko-ken as well, without being afraid of cats or loosing control  of myself?"</p><p>Millenia thought for a moment  then looked Ranma over carefully, after a minute she seemed to find what she  was looking for and nodded to herself.</p><p>"Well probably with a little  time you could pull it off without much trouble, but that won't be anything to  worry about."</p><p>"Now back to business, so  which will it be the easy way or the hard way."</p><p>Most people consider the  Saotome stomach to be the biggest problem Ranma has inherited from Genma, well  most times they might be correct, this time however proved that this was not  always the case as the Saotome "Foot in mouth" syndrome engaged with a  vengeance.</p><p>"Um, the easy way?"</p><p>After saying this Ranma  realized what she was talking about and could think only one thing before all  went dark again.</p><p>'Damn it, me and my big  mouth.'</p><p>In Ranma's home Universe  just as he was being transported several things where happening all at once.</p><p>In The Tendo house Genma was  in the middle of a rather small snack *it was only taking up half the table*  when unnoticed to him a black glow appeared around him and an orb of darkness  flew out of him and vanished as soon as it was a foot away from him.</p><p>After this happened Genma  continued eating for a minute before stopping and looking first confused then  amazed then tremendously happy.</p><p>"It's a miracle, after  twenty years of hunger at last I'm full, hmm time to celebrate... I wonder If  Ukyo would be willing to feed her poor starving fiancé's father."</p><p>Also, at the market as Kasumi  was trying to find enough food for little enough money a black glow also formed  around her, as it had with Genma an orb of Darkness leapt from her back and  vanished no more then a foot away.</p><p>People seeing this just  shrugged and put it down to Nerima's strangeness.</p><p>After the orb had left  Kasumi however people began to notice Kasumi's smile seemed brighter, somehow  more personal then it used to be.</p><p>In The Desert near an Oasis,  Ryoga was stumbling along in a blind Rage, upset over Ranma causing him to  misplace all his water and then loose sight of the Oasis he had been walking  towards.</p><p>As Ryoga screamed for  Ranma's Death for the seven hundred and thirty fourth time this day a black  glow appeared around him and as with the last two times, a black orb left his  back only to disappear less then a foot from him.</p><p>Just as the orb left him  Ryoga stopped yelling, confused about why he was angry with Ranma, when it was  his own fault for leaving his water behind so as it wouldn't causing him to  change into P-chan.</p><p>After thinking for a few  moments, he shrugged and turned around walking in an exact line towards the  Oasis without getting lost once.</p><p>This happened to Nabiki and  Kodachi as they where arguing to cost of a set of pictures of Ranma's male form  shirtless, sweaty and in mid-strike in the Dojo.</p><p>As the black glow appeared  over them both they started in shock for a moment then blinked as it left.</p><p>Both shaking their heads  they got back to business.</p><p style="text-align:center;">(Music:  Conan the Barbarian - Riddle of Steel)</p><p>The sound of a blade being  drawn rang through the humid air of the Valley of the flying Dragon.</p><p>Gadwin grunted sword in  hand, as the skull thrown by the Red Devil he was facing hit him in his  unarmored side.</p><p>He had come deep into the  valley to train; as he had found few human opponents that could match him steel  to steel he had to make do with quantity over quality.</p><p>Centering himself, he drew  on the magic at his command focusing it into his blade, with a roar he ran  towards his enemy.</p><p>"Eruption Cut"</p><p>As he cried forth the name  of the technique he was using his blade sliced deep into his enemy, a few  moments after it had struck his enemy exploded in a fiery death.</p><p>Re-sheathing his blade on  his back and wiping the sweat and blood from his brow Gadwin winced as his  injured side throbbed in pain as if to remind him of its presence. Sighing in  realization that he would have to visit Dr Alma and muttering under his breath  for probably the hundredth time that he really needed to learn some healing  magic he started for Dight Village.</p><p>Halfway to his destination  Gadwin was surprised to see a flash of light in his path that quickly faded  leaving some strange furniture and a cocoon of ebony energy.</p><p>Drawing his sword and walking  slowly forward, Gadwin looked around to see if this was the start of an Ambush  set by a particularly smart monster.</p><p>Spotting nothing out of the  ordinary he picked up a branch in his free hand and gently brought it into  contact with the egg, seeing ho harm come to the egg or the branch he tossed to  branch over his shoulder and moved to touch the egg with his free hand.</p><p>Just as he was about to make  contact with the midnight black surface it winked out of existence letting a  pigtailed man slump over seemingly unconscious.</p><p>Standing still for a moment  before re-sheathing his blade again he knelt down to examine the youth, finding  a pulse and noting the physical condition of a warrior he was about to pick him  up to take with him when he spied a sword laying on the ground next to his leg.  Concluding that the blade must belong to the person before him he picked it up  before slinging the youth over his shoulder.</p><p>As he continued his trek  towards the Village, Gadwin allowed himself a smile as even if he had arrived  in a somewhat unusual way it was starting to look like Gadwin may have found  himself a sparing partner.</p><p>Tio strode down the street  to Setsuna's home, staff taping against the ground with every second step she  made.</p><p>She had been warned long ago  what had most likely happened but she could still hope, maybe her training had  been enough, maybe she had instilled enough caution into Setsuna to check all  options in the Gates of Time before making a hasty and most likely very costly  mistake.</p><p>As she spotted the open gate  of Setsuna's home she sighed because in all likelihood the worst had happened  and Ranma had been Banished... for now anyway.</p><p>Walking up the stairs to the  door, she set her staff beside the door and opened it, taking time to remove  her footwear before continuing.</p><p>Looking up from where she  had placed her slippers she spotted Setsuna looking worried and worst of all  guilty.</p><p>So, sighing she walking  calmly past Setsuna to where there should have been a couch, table and a few  choice items she had left in Setsuna's care that, had all gone as she feared  would not be here looked at the floor where once was a couch and pondered  cursing aloud.</p><p>"Setsuna, my former student  please tell me you didn't do something... ill advised."</p><p>Turning to look at Setsuna  and finding her doing a very credible impersonation of a five year old with  there hand caught in the cookie jar she once again sighed and motioned for  Setsuna to follow her to the kitchen table where they could both be seated.</p><p>As they both took seats Tio  motioned Setsuna to explain what had happened.</p><p>"Well..." Setsuna began,  chewing on her lower lip for a moment before continuing.</p><p>"As you may have known for  the past 17 years now due to a boy named Ranma Saotome I have been suffering  from a rather debilitating migraine. Well as of about a month ago I noticed  that he had done all that he was needed to do in this timeline."</p><p>Now looking rather sheepish  Setsuna looked down at her clasped hands resting on the table and before  continuing.</p><p>"So I set in motion a plan  that would have him here this morning and unable to resist my plan to remove  him from this timeline and send him to another."</p><p>Tio looked at Setsuna in  confusion before asking a question.</p><p>"Forgive me for interrupting  but I think I may have gotten my time table muddled, are you telling me that  your Princess has already defeated Beryl and her backer?"</p><p>Setsuna looked up with a  worried look in her eye.</p><p>"What does that have to do  with Ranma?"</p><p>"I'll take that as a no then,  Setsuna you seem to have missed something rather major."</p><p>"When Usagi tries to use her  full power to destroy Beryl and her queen she will either, a: be unable to; or  b: die in the attempt."</p><p>Setsuna, now white as a  ghost and gaping like a fish could utter only one word.</p><p>"Wh-Wh-Why."</p><p>Tio lowered her head and  sighed, something she had been doing a lot of this day.</p><p>"Do you remember to story I  told you of Granas and Valmar?"</p><p>Getting a nod, she  continued.</p><p>"Then what about Ryudo,  Elena and Millenia?"</p><p>Again getting a slow nod in  answer, she forged onward.</p><p>"Good, then what about the  fact that Elena's daughter was the first of the Serenity line."</p><p>Tio saw Setsuna hesitate and  look down.</p><p>"Oh dear, that may begin to explain  how this happened, well she was and Millenia was the starting point of the  Royal family of Earth, this is where the soul bond came from between your  Princess and Endymion in their past life."</p><p>Setsuna looked up with worry  on her face.</p><p>"Won't that be enough to  ensure Usagi's survival... after all they are a destined love?"</p><p>Tio allowed herself a giggle  at Setsuna's naivety</p><p>"Setsuna nothing is set in  stone, you of all people should realize that and the only thing destined is a  favorable reaction if they're meeting is amicable in the first place."</p><p>"If they are pushed then yes  they will most likely marry and carry out your silly plans, though considering  the object lessons both Granas and your queen present I know not why you even  bother, but this is not what we should be speaking of now."</p><p>Tio closed her eyes and  gathered her thoughts.</p><p>"Now as I was saying,  Serenity the younger and Endymion had a soul bond in their last life, this has  a great deal to do with why she agreed to the engagement with him. In this life  however it was Ranma who is her anchor, and yes I know they have a gap between  there births, this is normal as few expect a child to need the ability to wield  power enough to require the bond, so long as the are both alive by the time the  first reaches there Sixteenth year, all is fine."</p><p>"Due to the reincarnation  there is still a residue of the previous bond, but as I said that isn't enough  for Usagi to defeat Beryl let alone her queen, hah it's barely enough to allow  her to transform without serious strain. Why after all did you think she  required so much food?"</p><p>As Tio had talked Setsuna  seemed to become increasingly worried, finally as Tio finished, she seemed to  draw herself up as if preparing herself for pain or disappointment.</p><p>"So does this mean if  through some miracle we manage to get Ranma back he will end up supplanting  Endymion in the Princess heart?"</p><p>Tio looked pained for a  moment before looking into Setsuna's eyes and saying with an almost cold voice.</p><p>"I don't, can't know more like  but to be very honest with you I can hope. I know it hurts you to hear this but  I see little to no use in the making of a mistake that has been made not once  but twice all ready, at least with Ranma there is no chance of another tyranny  of light and order arising."</p><p>Standing up and gathering  her things Tio left the speechless Setsuna to her thoughts, having things she  herself must do, though just as she was about to leave the door she stop and  half turn her head to look back at Setsuna.</p><p>"One final word of advice,  go to the Gate, slow the flow of time, you must give Ranma as much time to  return as you can else any hope of your dream will be lost."</p><p>This said Tio marched  purposefully out the door leaving an almost broken Setsuna behind her.</p><p>A.N.</p><p>Ok once again thanks to Guy  Jin and Rift120 for the help, this would be a lot more</p><p>messed up if not for you  two. Next, congrats to Jpalmgren for spotting how the</p><p>ring works and maybe even a  few things to come and thanks for the kind words</p><p>from keds999 and Pel'el and  also Jpalmgren ^_^</p><p>Any C&amp;C send to DarkFurr  at</p>
