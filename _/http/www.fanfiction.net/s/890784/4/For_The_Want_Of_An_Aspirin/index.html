"Order</p><p>whatever you want Ranma don't worry too much about the cost, I'll cover  it. You</p><p>just eat 'cause just between you and me, you look like you could use  the meat on</p><p>ya."</p><p>Grunting, Ranma nodded his head slightly, just wishing that the room  would stop</p><p>swaying and the voice in his head would shut her yap.</p><p>'Be quiet you. Can't you go bother someone else, anyone at all? My head  hurts</p><p>enough without dealing with chicks right now.'</p><p>Chicks? CHICKS! Who are you calling a chick you irritating under  brained-</p><p>over muscled little boy! Why when I get my hands on you... the  remainder of</p><p>this thought was reduced to muttering and background noise as Ranma  zoned her</p><p>out so he could deal with more important things, namely FOOD. Well that  and</p><p>listening to whatever Gadwin was talking about.</p><p>"Did you hear what I was just saying Ranma? Well anyway, what I said  was that</p><p>I'll be back shortly. I have some things to take care off, once I'm  finished I'll come</p><p>back and we can talk." Gadwin turned and started for the door.</p><p>As Gadwin was making his way back to the door Ranma's voice rang out  from</p><p>behind him. "Innkeeper, bring me three of everything on pages one to  seven and</p><p>one of everything on the even pages, as well as pages nine, eleven and  seventeen."</p><p>Gadwin winced, thinking that it was just his luck to come across  someone with an</p><p>appetite that could put an army brigade to shame. Oh well, hopefully  Ranma would</p><p>be able to give him a decent fight-he had better for the cost feeding  him would be.</p><p>Darkness; broken by a single flickering candle set on a tome-covered  desk.</p><p>Darkness; both cold and unforgiving, hiding faces familiar to many.</p><p>Darkness; filled with the soft sobs of a young girl, terror filled and  losing hope.</p><p>Gadwin peered into the tent setup across town from the inn, trying to  see if the</p><p>person he was looking for was in. Gadwin relaxed as his gaze settled on  the petite</p><p>form of the Mogay merchant Gina, one of the few people willing to risk  the</p><p>journey required to get to Dight Village from the other continent. She  was a lifeline</p><p>to many, bringing medicines and equipment that were impossible to  procure</p><p>through other channels.</p><p>Walking forward to greet the big man entering her tent, Gina wondered  what</p><p>brought him here considering that most things she did he had no use  for. Deciding</p><p>that there was no use trying to figure it out with so little  information Gina set about</p><p>finding out in the quickest manner possible: she asked.</p><p>"Hiya Gadwin, What'sa you want?" Gina quirked a thin eyebrow on her  angular</p><p>face and flicked one of her long ears out of her face as she stood in  front of</p><p>Gadwin (1).</p><p>Gadwin smiled a broad easy smile as he looked down at the Mogay  merchant who</p><p>was doing so much for the village. "Well, I was wondering if you might  have</p><p>something that would suit one of the new arrivals in the village. He  seems to be a</p><p>warrior, but I don't think any of the armor available here would suit  him. He</p><p>doesn't seem the sort to be weighted down in battle, so the only other  option was</p><p>you."</p><p>Gina's dark eyes twinkled with interest, someone new in the village and  a warrior</p><p>who didn't go for the human-mountain view on combat that seemed so  common</p><p>around these parts? How... interesting. "Well, you'sa show me this'a  one and I'll'a</p><p>have a look see, if'a I like, then maybe I have'a something that would  suit'sa your</p><p>need."</p><p>Gadwin was about to nod when an explosion rocked the village, looking  startled</p><p>Gadwin turned. "That sounded like it came from the inn, I hope Ranma's  not in</p><p>trouble." After saying this Gadwin set off towards the inn as fast has  his legs could</p><p>take him.</p><p>Gina followed with a thoughtful look on her face.</p><p>Deep in a secret underground research station: a group of scientists,  mages, and</p><p>various other researchers that had been gathered together to start work  on a project</p><p>by Baal. This project was something he came up with after he found some  new</p><p>information on the goings on in the time of Angelou. These writings  told of a man</p><p>from the heavens that came to learn and create. His name was Valmar,  and it was</p><p>he who the legends talked about when they spoke in hushed voices of the  man who</p><p>tried to steal the Icarian wings, but who instead gained wings of  darkness.</p><p>As Baal examined the writing, he began to form an idea. This book  talked of Geia</p><p>and the great project that had been undertaken, and the similarities it  had to that of</p><p>Valmar.</p><p>Valmar's efforts were to change humanity into something that could  stand against</p><p>his enemies; where as the project surrounding Geia's creation was to  gain the</p><p>power of the Icarian for those better suited to lead.</p><p>Thus, Baal set about having his researchers try to combine the two, not  forsaking</p><p>the original research mind you merely adding a new facet to it. Thus  was Project</p><p>Valkyrie born; the project that was just now as Baal watched on bearing  its</p><p>poisoned fruit.</p><p>Platters  heaped full of food made there way across the Inn to Ranma's table.</p><p>With joy filled gaze Ranma saw the meal seat before him and set into it  with the</p><p>gusto only a Saotome unfed three days can manage. After several minutes  of eating</p><p>and three pages on the menu a loutish voice broke the stunned silence  of the other</p><p>patrons watching the natural disaster that was Ranma.</p><p>"Hey, whaddya think youse is doing at OUR table?"</p><p>A minute later and another menu page and the voice rang out again.</p><p>If one listened closely enough one could almost hear the brain cells  being burned</p><p>out through sudden overuse.</p><p>"Hey, who do youse think youse is ignoring me like dat?</p><p>Who where they? He didn't care; they were as far from being more  important than</p><p>food to a Saotome as Ranma was from quoting astrophysics. Ranma calmly</p><p>continued ignoring whoever was speaking and started to eat another bowl  of</p><p>ramen.</p><p>The only sound in the room-other than that of the death and  destruction of many a</p><p>fine meal-was the sound of the last thread of a temper fraying and  coming closer</p><p>and closer to snapping.</p><p>"Grrr, Listen to me damn it, don't ya know who I am?"</p><p>Ranma grumbled to himself, why was it he could never eat a meal without  some</p><p>half-assed git interrupting him, if it wasn't Akane or his old man, it  was Ryoga or</p><p>one of the various other problems in his life. Hell even in whatever  world he had</p><p>been banished to by the PMS Queen Pluto, some bastard was trying to  interrupt his</p><p>meal. Well he sighed to himself he'd have to do something soon or he'd  just get</p><p>attacked and that would waste all this wonderful food and he couldn't  have that.</p><p>So Ranma calmly set down the bowl and slowly turned his void black gaze  to see</p><p>who dared come between him and food.</p><p>Standing in front of a dozen unshaven and armed men was someone who  looked</p><p>more ape then man, long gangly arms reaching almost to his knees  attached to</p><p>shoulders almost as wide as he was tall, and capped off with a face  that not only a</p><p>mother couldn't love but that had gotten her husband beaten for as a  result.</p><p>Ranma put all his years of training with his father to use as he opened  his mouth</p><p>and in the most insulting voice possible said, "Listen, I don't know  who you are</p><p>but you're starting to tick me off, leave now or I won't be held  responsible for</p><p>what happens."</p><p>If Genma had been here he couldn't have been prouder of his son's  ability to</p><p>enrage anyone, anywhere in two sentences or less. The face of the  leader of the</p><p>motley turned purple, and then red, steam seemed to come from his ears.</p><p>"Listen youse little puke, who da hell do ya t'ink youse is to tell me,  ME! The Boss</p><p>of the 'Really Mean Bandits' what ta do?"</p><p>After a mental laugh at someone admitting to calling their group  something so</p><p>stupid he sighed. "Ok, fine. If that's the way you want to do this then  I really have</p><p>only two words to say to you."</p><p>The goon snorted. "Yeah wha's that? Gunna start beggin' fer mercy now  'fore we</p><p>pound ya?"</p><p>Ranma just raised his head and replied, "No… this."</p><p>Swiftly bringing his arm level with the floor and his now open palm  pointing at the</p><p>leader of the group Ranma barked out, "Shadow Lance!" Black energy  coursed</p><p>down his arm and settled into his palm before erupting across the room  and with a</p><p>roar blowing the leader off his feet and through the open door.</p><p>Millenia's voice echoed in Ranma's mind as the energy from the spell  dispersed</p><p>Well done student, I give that an 8. Next time though try not to  use so much</p><p>energy that's all the willed magic you'll be able to pull until we get  to finish that</p><p>meal.</p><p>'Ha...' Ranma mentally sneered at his self-proclaimed teacher '... I'd  like to see</p><p>you do better.'</p><p>Hmmm... Oh don't worry student you will tonight. A sinister  grin seemed to</p><p>enshroud these words as they slowly faded from his mind.</p><p>Slowly getting to his feet Ranma turned to the innkeeper. "Mind keeping  this warm</p><p>for me? It seems there's some trash to be dealt with." Seeing the  innkeeper nod,</p><p>Ranma turned to the gap jawed idiots "Okay, lets take this outside, I  doubt the</p><p>innkeeper would appreciate us wrecking his inn."</p><p>Baal watched silently as the vermin working on this project ran  backwards and</p><p>forwards checking and triple-checking everything to make sure there  were no</p><p>mistakes, after all they all understood what would happen should a  mistake be</p><p>made.</p><p>Finally, after waiting for almost an hour everything was ready, Dr. Vuton  had just</p><p>come by to tell him that they would start the vitalization process  shortly.</p><p>"Nine, eight, zeven, zix, five, four, t'ree, two, vun, zero,  Vitalzzation prozezz</p><p>z'tarted." The weasely little man shouted with glee as Mana started to  flow through</p><p>the conduits and wires, infusion the vessel with power and hopeful  life.</p><p>As the power began to flow into the vessel a dull thrum could be heard,  energy</p><p>began to arch across the surface of the pod, technicians flipped  switches and turned</p><p>knobs, and Baal watched on in growing impatience as the culmination of  years of</p><p>work finally came together.</p><p>"Everzing is ready my Lord. You have but to zay zee vord and ve vill  zee if zee</p><p>technizionz vill zervive thiz project." Vuton reported tacking a sadistic  joy in</p><p>pointing out to all just how fragile their grip on life truly was and  just how much</p><p>they all had resting on this experiment.</p><p>"Very well," barked Baal, "commence." As the words left Baal's lips,  one tech</p><p>pulled the final lever and inside the pod a sealed hole in the roof  irised open and a</p><p>pale grey sludge started to fill the interior.</p><p>The thrumming rose in pitch and more and more power was poured into the</p><p>primordial soap within the pod, as well as terabyte after terabyte of  information,</p><p>personality overlays, directives, hopes, dreams, likes, dislikes  everything a person</p><p>should know, everything a person needed to know, or at least what Baal  believed</p><p>they needed to know.</p><p>'Soon', Baal thought. 'Soon, all will be ready, and nothing will be  able to stand</p><p>before me.'</p><p>She,  just like all her friends had ignored the stories of strange things in Nerima:</p><p>stories  of girls going missing in the middle of the day; stories of strange monsters</p><p>that lurked  in the shadows. After all everyone knew that this was home to some of</p><p>the  greatest martial artists in the world, who would be foolish enough to do  something like that here?</p><p>And  anyway everyone knew monsters where the stuff of fantasies. Pity it was the</p><p>very  type of person she had been sure would keep danger away had in fact turned</p><p>out  to be the danger she would face. Thus it was that Minako was in the situation</p><p>that  she found herself.</p><p>"Please, please just, just let me go. I promise I won't tell anyone  please just let me</p><p>go," sobbed the young girl tied to the evil looking altar.</p><p>"Sweet flower, do not cry. Alas I cannot let thee free, but rejoice  that your sacrifice</p><p>will be for a most noble cause." The robe clad Kuno looked up from  where he was</p><p>studying one of the many tomes on his cluttered desk. "Yes, for once I  have found</p><p>the correct ritual you will help me gain the power to defeat the fiend  Saotome and</p><p>his minions."</p><p>Minako just seemed to sob harder and Kuno shrugged and ignored her, going  back</p><p>to looking for the ritual he required. Truly duty was a harsh mistress,  but he knew</p><p>that should he find himself unable to do what needed to be done  countless others</p><p>would suffer, and so he was caused to make hard decisions and to do  that which</p><p>was for the greater good, after all what was the life of one person  compared to the</p><p>chance to put a halt to the vile Saotome's reign of terror</p><p>One thought went through Minako's mind before she fell asleep, 'Why is  it always</p><p>the cute ones?'</p><p>As Gadwin ducked and dived around people as quickly as he could, he  cursed</p><p>under his breath. What was it with this kid that he couldn't go half an  hour without</p><p>causing a problem or getting himself in trouble? Ducking around a cart  that was</p><p>bring someone's produce into market Gadwin caught a glimpse of Gina's  slight</p><p>form flowing around people as she headed off to see what the commotion  was,</p><p>well at least she would be able to see who the gear was for before  hand.</p><p>Gadwin skidded to a halt outside Dr Alma's Office and grabbed Ranma's  sheathed</p><p>sword, 'Better get this to him, if he's in a fight he'll probably need  it.'</p><p>Once again Gadwin set off as fast as his feet could carry him across  the village</p><p>knocking over a few people on his way, once he got to the Inn he saw  Ranma</p><p>unarmed and surrounded by thirteen bandits all armed an looking ready  to kill.</p><p>Drawing back his arm Gadwin yelled, "Ranma, catch!" And heaved the  sheathed</p><p>blade into the air, watching it fly he thought for a moment that he may  have thrown</p><p>it to hard when just as it reached its apex Ranma leaped into the air  and caught the</p><p>blade.</p><p>Ranma stopped just as he stepped out of the inn, inside there had only  been twelve</p><p>bandits, not counting their leader, but now standing in two groups at  both ends of</p><p>the street was no less the thirty and maybe a few more than that.</p><p>Ranma smirked 'Well, maybe this will be more of a work out than I  thought, heh.</p><p>Maybe I should try the other trick Red taught me, see how she likes  that.'</p><p>As Ranma made his way to the center of the street the bandits shifted  nervously,</p><p>Most where wondering why this guy wasn't even looking concerned let  alone</p><p>worried, a few others had seen what he had done inside the inn and knew  that</p><p>wasn't any type of magic they had heard of, and something unknown was  usually</p><p>something bad.</p><p>Feet planted firmly in the loose dirt of the street, arms at his side,  Ranma cooked</p><p>his head to the side and he glared at the leader of this group.</p><p>"Ok, here we are. You want to start this dance or do I get to?"</p><p>With  a growl of rage the slightly singed bandit leader roared, "Kill the little  puke,</p><p>and  make sure you do it slowly like."</p><p>As the last echoes of the command faded into nothing the group drew  there various</p><p>weapons as one. Daggers and swords stood beside staves and clubs, one  man even</p><p>had a rather powerful looking crossbow that creaked with the strain of  the draw.</p><p>A moment of silence passed, and almost as one they surged forth hoping  to</p><p>overwhelm Ranma with sheer numbers.</p><p>As the first man started to draw back his arm to strike Ranma's  previously closed</p><p>eyes snapped open and a vicious grin split his face as he barked two  words,</p><p>"Tainted Wind!" As the words left his mouth a shadowy force seemed to  reach out</p><p>and pick the bandits up and hurl them away from Ranma who now stood  with</p><p>wings unleashed and shrouded in power.</p><p>"Well that was less then satisfying. Hmmm, can't throw anything big in  here so</p><p>let's try the other way."</p><p>Ranma seemed to concentrate for a moment, as if trying to remember  something</p><p>long forgotten, suddenly as if a switch had been thrown Ranma  straitened throwing</p><p>his shoulders back and brought his cupped hands before him and began to  chant.</p><p>Darkness hear my shouted plea,</p><p>Lend your strength now unto me,</p><p>I call you past the Twilight Pall,</p><p>Your majesty I now unveil,</p><p>OBLIVION!</p><p>As the last shouted word left his lips he threw his hands forward as  power flowed</p><p>across his arms and spewed down the street taking out the bandits  there.</p><p>After seeing almost half his men taken down with one spell the leader  turned to a</p><p>rail thin bandit dressed in ratty clothing and started screaming "Hurry  up and put</p><p>up the anti-magic field you fool, or do you want to be the next one he  gets with that</p><p>strange magic!"</p><p>The mage looked around nervously before he started to concentrate a  pale light</p><p>seemed to illuminate him as he brought his hands forth and shouted the  name of</p><p>the spell, "Shhhh!" A vortex of anti-magic whirled around Ranma cutting  him off</p><p>from most of his magic, and all of the magic he could use at the moment  due to</p><p>lack of energy.</p><p>As all looked on the wings of pitch black adorning Ranma's shoulders  flickered</p><p>and faded from sight.</p><p>With a silent curse Ranma slipped into a loose stance and glared at the  mage</p><p>promising to deal with him last, just so he would have the time to make  it last.</p><p>Before anyone could blink Ranma had leapt to the side of where he was,  catching</p><p>two well thrown knives and returning them to there senders, one through  his</p><p>shoulder the other splitting the offenders kneecap, as Ranma landed a  cry went up</p><p>from outside of the bandits. "Ranma, catch!" He looked up and saw the  sword that</p><p>had made this trip with him soaring high above the ground, bracing  himself he</p><p>leapt to meet it, catching it he threw a quick salute to Gadwin.</p><p>Sheathed blade in hand Ranma landed, once again surrounded by bandits  though</p><p>less then the first time. "Heh," Ranma snorted after drawing the blade,  "I doubt I'll</p><p>need this for the likes of you." So saying the blade was sent flying  over his</p><p>shoulder to land firmly planted between the legs of a bandit who had  silently been</p><p>edging away from where he had been blown by Ranma's spell. Seeing the  sword</p><p>planted so close to all he held dear, the bandit did the only thing he  could. Eyes</p><p>rolling up into his head he fainted and bid goodbye to the waking  world.</p><p>Cracking his knuckles Ranma gave this group there first viewing of his  infamous</p><p>smirk and set about proving why it was foolish to engage Ranma Saotome  in close</p><p>combat, a sword strike was effortlessly blocked with the scabbard still  clenched in</p><p>Ranma's left hand and redirected into the path of one of its fellows,  the wielder</p><p>sent to an early repose with a swift blow behind the ear, the next was  brought down</p><p>with a brutal kick to the knee bending it in reverse of its proper  angel and pain</p><p>filled cry of that bandit was silenced by a kick to the temple, three  where brought</p><p>down with a single round house kick and another with the back fist that  followed.</p><p>The bandit leader watched on in disgust as his men where defeated one  by one,</p><p>with a cry of rage he let loose a command "BRING IN DA BRUTE SQUAD!"</p><p>His men now scattered seemed to, as one heave a sigh of relief and a  group of six</p><p>huge men dressed in a strange form of leather armor came rushing from  the gates.</p><p>Ranma stilled and turned to take the measure of this new threat, seeing  that with</p><p>the exception of one they all moved with the tread of brawlers, rather  than martial</p><p>artist's, he relaxed slightly. The other who stayed behind the rest  didn't move right,</p><p>he didn't flow like a martial artist or seem to barge his way through  the air like a</p><p>brawler his movements where stilted, jerky and yet smother then they  should have</p><p>been as well, he was a group of contradictions that all screamed one  thing, that this</p><p>person was not to be underestimated and should be treated with caution.</p><p>Two of this new group split off from the other four and slowly advanced  on</p><p>Ranma. One was armed with a huge hammer that looked as if someone had  taken a</p><p>section from a giant tree and put a pole through it to use as a handle,  the second</p><p>wielded a set of wicked looking clawed gauntlets each with three barbed  blades</p><p>that constantly dripped strange venom.</p><p>As the two began to circle Ranma he looked them over, both seemed use  to</p><p>working as a team so he doubted it would be easy to get them to tangle  each other</p><p>up or get in each others way, it looked like that only sure way of  taking them out</p><p>was a frontal assault on one that would take them down before the other  could</p><p>react, strategy set Ranma flowed towards the clawed hulk as he was the  closest</p><p>target.</p><p>"Kachuu Tenshin Amaguriken" he cried as his arms blurred and blows  rained</p><p>down on the chest of his enemy the repulsive sound of ribs breaking  followed by a</p><p>stunned silence the result.</p><p>Ranma swiftly moved away from his fallen foe and his compatriot. He was  about</p><p>the start on the second when he noticed a mocking clapping coming from  the</p><p>group's leader.</p><p>"Hahaha, very nicely done but you did seal your fate, you did. Now you  will face</p><p>the terror that is the Mark Seven Basilisk armor-patent pending. Even  as we speak</p><p>your hand is turning to stone, sure you may be able to defeat one or  even two more</p><p>of my Brute Squad but by that time you'll be nothing but a statue that  we will</p><p>crush."</p><p>Ranma looked down at his hands and sure enough the fingers where solid  stone</p><p>and his hands where slowly transforming as well, as despair began to  rise he felt</p><p>something shift and the transformation halted then reversed.</p><p>Baka, next time someone throws you your sword, USE IT!</p><p>Three guesses who that was and no she wasn't happy.</p><p>'Fine, fine, I'll use the sword  then. Gee a guy can't catch a break, can he?'</p><p>You keep making screw ups like that last one and a break is exactly  what you'll</p><p>get and a one-way trip to the next life. I'm not sure I could pull that  trick of again,</p><p>even if I wanted to.</p><p>Ranma looked at the gloating Bandit leader then to his hand and back  again, he</p><p>slowly lifted his hand so everyone could see it, and one by one flexed  his fingers,</p><p>smirking as the bandit leader's face fell. He slowly walked to where his  sword was</p><p>sticking out of the ground not an inch from the groin of some  unfortunate bandit</p><p>and yanked it out of the ground. Turning to ease into a basic ready  stance facing</p><p>the now furious hammer wielding brute, Ranma calmly tossed the scabbard  he had</p><p>been holding over his shoulder, where it hit the waking bandit and sent  him back to</p><p>dreamland.</p><p>"Right then, let see if you're as easy to take down as your claw happy  buddy then."</p><p>Ranma Taunted the Brute who gave an incoherent roar and charged hammer</p><p>swung high.</p><p>Ranma slipped past him with ease and flicked the sword blade out as he  was</p><p>passing leaving a shallow cut across the gut of the man.</p><p>The big man groaned as he got up from his knees and turned a baleful  glare at</p><p>Ranma, who calmly cocked his eyebrow and made a 'come on then' motion  with</p><p>his empty hand.</p><p>The big man scowled and griped his hammer tightly, he slowly edged his  left foot</p><p>forward before quickly swinging his hammer over his shoulder and  launching</p><p>himself at Ranma, as Ranma tried to do as he had last time he was  caught</p><p>unprepared by the round house swing the hammer wielder performed that  covered</p><p>almost half the street and proved to much for Ranma to dodge.</p><p>Ranma picked himself up from where he had hit the inn wall and grunted,  eyeing</p><p>the now confounded hammer wielder with scorn he bit out "Hah, you call  that a</p><p>hit? Weak little girls have hit me harder. Come on, put your back into  it, are you a</p><p>man or what?"</p><p>The taunts once again had the desired effect and set off a blind charge  from the</p><p>hammer wielder, this time Ranma brought the sword to his side and  prepared to</p><p>strike, as the bellowing bull of a man started to complete his massive  overhead</p><p>swing Ranma streaked forward and brought the blade around in a savage  wide</p><p>arced slash. For a moment both combatants stood there Ranma in his  finishing</p><p>stance sword held out beside him after finishing his slash and the big  man with his</p><p>hammer still over his head, until finally the big man started to topple  as his tunic</p><p>became sodden in his life blood.</p><p>Ranma calmly stood up and brought the sword once more to his side and  glanced</p><p>at the four remaining members of the Brute Squad "Well, who's next?"</p><p>The Brute Leader gave a quick hand signal and the Brute standing behind  the Gang</p><p>Leader raised his meaty fist and knocked out the fool before tossing  him over his</p><p>shoulder as the others went to work gathering the wounded and dead, as  the Silver</p><p>haired Brute watched before he turned towards Ranma.</p><p>"Well, That's enough of that, I've got better things to do but I'll  tell you what,</p><p>show me what you've got, If you give a good enough showing, maybe I'll  let you</p><p>live for a while longer, I need a workout anyway."</p><p>After saying this the Leader flicked a small buckler from his back into  the air and</p><p>after drawing the Gladius at his side caught the falling shield in his  off hand.</p><p>Just before he was about to begin he paused and smirked for a second  "Oh, By the</p><p>way, the name is Stiel, remember it."</p><p>Ranma, Seeing the remaining bandits fade away one by one smirked as  finally he</p><p>felt a tickle in the back of his mind telling him is magic was at his  command again,</p><p>not that he would need it.</p><p>"Hah, I'll give you more then a work out, let's hope you can keep up  with me,</p><p>wouldn't want to fall asleep mid-swing now would I."</p><p>Nodding once Stiel began to circle with his stance close and defensive  for the</p><p>moment.</p><p>Ranma tucked his sword close to his side and flickered forward sure he  would be</p><p>able to finish this soon enough that his waiting meal wouldn't even be  cold.</p><p>As Ranma neared his enemy a glow sprang up around the Brute Leader and  he</p><p>jumped back and let loss a cry "Quake Cutter" as the words left his  lips the energy</p><p>surged from his blade and rocket across the ground, catching Ranma  unprepared</p><p>and thus hitting him full on and throwing him from his feet.</p><p>'Damn, this guys not messing around, guess I'll have to stop playing  around and</p><p>take this seriously. Damn what's the world coming to?'</p><p>As Ranma climbed to his feet he saw his opponent waiting calmly for him  to rise.</p><p>"At last I have found it!" Tatewaki cried with glee as he held aloft a  rune-covered</p><p>book.</p><p>As he  brought the book down again and began to read he felt a thrill of elation go</p><p>through  him, soon, very soon he would have the power he required to bring down</p><p>the  cursed Saotome.</p><p>Baal glared in impatience as the lab workers scurried around like rats  doing their</p><p>work. He knew it would take time, but the longer required for  completion the</p><p>longer it would be before he could deal with some... troubling problems  that had</p><p>arisen-namely his son and the Icarian.</p><p>Soon he would have much less  need for them, but for now he must wait.</p><p>Professor Vuton came scampering over to him with glee written on his  face.</p><p>"My Lord, ve are ready to begin ze nexzt ztage, all ve need iz your  vord."</p><p>Baal looked down at the little man and slowly nodded his head,  signaling to</p><p>commence.</p><p>"Ztart ze nexzt ztage" Vuton cried with glee, as buttons and levers  where pull and</p><p>the magical energy being injected into the chamber in the center of the  room</p><p>seemed to increase in potency and energy crackled around the frame  holding the</p><p>chamber in place.</p><p>As the opening at in the roof of the chamber finally closed sealing the  now full</p><p>chamber the breakers that had been keeping the energy away from the  goop inside</p><p>where removed and pure magical energy flowed through the primordial  ooze</p><p>inside.</p><p>As seconds ticked by nothing seemed to happen until finally a shockwave  pulsed</p><p>out from the chamber throwing those closest off there feet, Dr Vuton  crowed with</p><p>delight as he looked up from the reading he had been monitoring "My  Lord, Ze</p><p>exzperiment, it iz a zuccezzez."</p><p>As Vuton spoke the words the chamber began to open, and all turned to  see what</p><p>would steep forth.</p><p>As Leen reached the door to Herr Mullen's office she paused to  compose herself,</p><p>as she well knew that only the worst news was handed out in this place,  Mullen</p><p>enjoyed giving good news where all could hear it. TC \l1 "</p><p>After a few moments Leen opened the door and stepped inside, seeing  Mullen at</p><p>his desk reading a report from one of his operatives with a palpable  aura of despair</p><p>as she closed the door behind her Mullen's head quickly rose a look of  worry on</p><p>his face that was instantly banished on seeing that it was Leen, Mullen  motioned</p><p>for her to come closer and take a seat before putting down the report  that he had</p><p>been going over.</p><p>"It's good to see you are well  Leen, unfortunately from the latest reports on my</p><p>father machinations this may not stay the same for long."</p><p>"It would seem that my father has finally gained a measure of success  in his quest</p><p>to find a more 'controllable' substitute for the power of the Icarians  in this project</p><p>'Valkyrie' of his."</p><p>"This means that you are much less valuable to him now, which means he  may</p><p>very well try to have you 'removed' so someone else doesn't use your  power</p><p>against him."</p><p>"This is why I'm going to ask you to do something for me, next time we  cross</p><p>paths with Justine and his companions go with them, help protect the  spirit stone</p><p>they have from my father and thus gain some protection for yourself."</p><p>Throughout Mullens speech Leen could only nod and think just how right  her</p><p>premonition had been, bad new indeed.</p><p>Notes TC \l1 "</p><p>Yeah finally finished this chapter *mutters* sorry for this taken so  damn long, I</p><p>was stuck on the fight scene as I'm not used to writing such a long  scene it had to</p><p>get help from others, thanks Jared btw for all your help and  suggestions and</p><p>everyone else as well.</p><p>Thanks to My Pre-readers, Guyjin most of all, without whom, I'd still  be</p><p>wondering if I should release this or not.</p><p>Also  thanks to Griever, Keep up the good work. ^_^</p><p>(1)   Yes the Mogay in this line are different from the game's version and  Gina is</p><p>older and Guido is unlikely  to show up anytime, why, that will be explained</p><p>latter on but it will be  explained.</p>
