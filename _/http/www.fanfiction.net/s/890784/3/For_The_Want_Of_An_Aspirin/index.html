</div><p>*Standard disclaimer*</p><p>This Fic is a crossover of Ranma ½ with Grandia and  Sailor Moon there will also be elements of Grandia 2 and maybe a few other  things please note that I own none of these, I'm just borrowing them, Thank  you.</p><p>*AU warning*</p><p>The Grandia universe is going  to be an AU and is going to suffer from some cross contamination from Ranma  entering it. Some main characters will change, that's what Ranma does to people  and places.</p><p>(Music – I  wanna Be Sedated by Offspring)</p><b>For the want of an Aspirin </b><p><b>Chapter 2 </b></p><p><b>Shades of Grey</b></p><p>Dr Alma rubbed the bridge of her noise and scowled,  she knew it was silly; Gadwin wouldn't lie to her even if he could do so but  the only other option was just too unbelievable to contemplate. Looking at  Gadwin's sincere face again and sighing in defeat, Dr Alma came to the  conclusion that unbelievable or not the young man Gadwin had brought into her  office unconscious had appeared out of thin air. Well that was Gadwin's story  and he seemed to be sticking to it. Now that hurdle had been crossed it was  time to get to what was important... that being the health of her newest  patient.</p><p>Looking over the young man Dr Alma frowned at the  strange mark on his forehead. Why in creation would someone have a silver sword  with black wings tattooed there of all places. Shrugging this off until the  subject was awake to answer questions Dr Alma focused her senses deeper and  found something that would explain why her patient was in a coma like state.</p><p>He seemed to be suffering from the most complete  Mana drain she had ever come across, and considering the size of the reserves  she could sense that fact alone was worrying. That he had been forced to use so  much Mana that he had needed to draw upon his own life energy just to do  whatever it was that caused this was also rather staggering. What had he been  trying to do, realign the moon or maybe cross the void between worlds? Laughing  silently to herself at the thought of the last option she chided her flight of  fancy before looking up to meet the concerned stare of Gadwin. "It's all right  Gadwin, he just seemed to be suffering from 'Mana Burnout' though considering  his reserves I'd rather never run into whatever caused this."</p><p>Seeing Gadwin sag with relief she cocked an eyebrow  at him "Why the concern? From your story you've never met before." Gadwin  seemed to think a moment before answering "Call it a hunch, but I think this  lad's going to be important somehow... besides, he looks like he might make a  good sparing partner, be better him then wandering the wilderness for weeks on  end looking for a good fight wouldn't it?"</p><p>Dr Alma giggled softly "Well since you have such a  vested interest in making sure he gets well you can stay here an keep an eye on  him, I have some things I need to get from the Mogay merchant, then I need to  talk something over with the Chief."</p><p>Gadwin nodded solemnly and leaned against the wall  to rest.</p><p>Dr Alma sighed softly and shook her head before  heading out to complete her chores.</p><p>Tanaka straightened his rumpled clothes and slicked  back his messed hair before turning to Akane. "As I was saying Akane-sama, all  reports say that Ranma has not been sighted anywhere near the other fiancés.  Also, none have seen him at any of the eateries around Nerima or any of the other  places he normally goes for time alone or to meet with one of the other girls.  The best guess we can come up with is that he has gained word of a new  challenge and is somewhere in the wilderness training to meet whatever threat  looms."</p><p>Akane finished brushing the grass from her clothing  listening with one ear to what Tanaka was saying, as his dissertation drew to a  close her face grew thoughtful and she seemed to fall into a trance like state.  After a few minutes of silence she shook herself awake and turned to Tanaka.  "If all you say is true Tanaka-san then my thanks to you, It would seem Ranma  has started to learn his place, one can only hope this is a glimpse to the end  of the farce of a race between myself and the others, as if any of them had a chance  at gaining Ranma's favor. Well if it is indeed as you say then I think I'll  have to go make something special for Ranma as a reward for doing what's  'right'." After saying this, she calmly drew her self up from where she was  leaning against a tree and started towards her home.</p><p>Some minutes later, a trio of scruffy boys one  holding a video camera walked up to Tanaka. Once they drew close enough to  speak without being over heard the tallest one asked "So why did you tell her  the truth about Ranma, Most would have made up lies to get her angry."  Listening intently to the boy Tanaka smiled as he finished and responded  smugly. "Ah dear Izaru, true, if I had told Akane-sama something less honest  she would indeed have been angered at Ranma." He spoke Ranma's name as a curse.  "But now that she is pleased with him, she will no doubt try to cook him a  feast, and for all she may try with all her heart her cooking is not fit for  human consumption. This way, at worst, Ranma will anger her with his refusals  to eat, thus earning honestly the braining that will follow. But if he should  gather his courage and try her meal, then if we are lucky he may die a  screaming death caused by our lady and if he doesn't then no doubt he will  anger her anyway thus suffering his justly earned punishment." As he drew to a  close he saw the looks of admiration in the eyes of his fellows and smiled,  being praised by one's peers was always something to enjoy.</p><p>As had happened before Ranma slowly rose from the  depths of sleep. A yawn and stretch followed by bleary eyes opening and looking  out across the black nothingness of the dreamscape. Seeing he was still  technically sleeping, he grumbled looking around for the witch that had tricked  him.</p><p>Spotting the red haired harridan floating some  distance away from him, an amused look on her face, he did the only thing he  could: he opened his big trap.</p><p>"Hey Lady, what do you think you where doing  tricking me like that? You know as well as I do that I didn't mean what I said,  at least not the way you took it."</p><p>A soft laugh answered this statement before the red  head's eyes flicked open and she assessed him. "Ranma you really should have  learned by now not to speak before you think about what's being asked of you. I  mean you spent how long living with that girl Nabiki and what did you learn?  Nothing, that's what, and now here you are sounding just like that little twit  Akane just after you have beaten her in a sparring match 'I wasn't ready', 'You  cheated', 'Try me for real this time' any of those sound familiar, hmm? Well  maybe you should consider learning from it this time."</p><p>Silence was all that followed this volley, as it  seemed Ranma was taking her advice and really thinking about what had been  said. After a few seconds Ranma's eyes flick up to her face and he asks "How'd  you know about all that, I thought you just woke up."</p><p>Grinning, Millenia replied "Well it's like this;  really I've been with you all the time, just... asleep is the closest you could  come to describing it. Everything that's happened to you has happened to me. I  just needed to bond with you closer to access it." She pauses to roll over in  midair so she would be lying on her stomach, thus giving Ranma a good look down  her cleavage. "The main reason for that is so I can help and understand you  better, one of the first things I intend to help you with, is being honest with  yourself, whether you like it or not. But before that I think it's time you  learned a little about magic, the basics if you will."</p><p>On hearing this Ranma's face screwed up in a look of  distaste and he once again opened his mouth "Look I don't need nothing to do  with magic, magic's nothing but trouble anyway. Feh, the only thing it's good  for is causing me problems. Hell, look at that Setsuna chick, because of her I  may never see my mom again and what's at fault? Magic, that's what."</p><p>Millenia just floated through this speal without a  care and once he has finished counters, "Yes Magic may cause troubles, but look  at it this way; If you knew anything about magic theory you would have been  much harder for Setsuna to capture, those compulsions she used are like  submission holds. They work great against someone with no magical training or  someone who hasn't been taught how to counter them, but if you know where to push  and where to bend they're easy to get around, even with your weakness towards  water magic."</p><p>Ranma sat in silence a look of  deep contemplation on his face, after minutes go by Millenia begins to wonder  if he's sleeping with his eyes open like he used to do at school. After 15  minutes Millenia is about ready to zap him when his eyes flick open and he  looks at her and sighed. "Ok maybe you've got a point about what you was saying  about magic. I'll learn, after all if a chick can do it, it can't be all that hard."  Just as his mouth shuts, the smell of ozone fills the area as a now crispy  Ranma crumples to the floor thanks to a steamed Millenia.</p><p>"First rule, student" growled  Millenia "Don't tick the teacher off."</p><p>It had been a day since the strange man had been  brought into Dr Alma's office by Gadwin. Ever since then, Dr Alma had been  trying to work out the puzzle that he represented. Because not only did he have  massive Mana reserves but he seemed to show no signs of having access to any of  the types of magic normally available. At first, he showed signs of a strong  leaning towards fire magic, so strong in fact that he was virtually defenseless  against water magic but that proved to be just another strange thing about this  young man. After a day of worthless study, Dr Alma had given in and had  contacted a friend who was responsible for magical research and the development  of the current magic system, one Professor J.D. Ohlmsworth.</p><p>Prof Ohlmsworth had arrived a few minutes ago and  was now studying the comatose man intently with a small monocle like device,  taking notes every so often. After half an hour of study, he turned to the  concerned Doctor and gave a small grin.</p><p>"It would seem that what we have here is an entirely  new facet of magic as of yet undiscovered. From what I can gather it has  something to do with darkness or shadow, so my guess is its opposite would be  light though where we will gain the readings required to produce a light egg I  have no idea. Give me a few minutes and I'll have all the data I require for  this shadow egg."</p><p>After saying this he set about taking more readings,  not noticing the pained look of indulgence of Dr Alma's face, she had always  said the professor had little in the way of bedside manner now he was proving  it, it was most likely lucky that the young man was unconscious at the moment.</p><p>"Oh yes, by the way Dr Alma, could you please  contact me when our young friend here awakens? I would like to talk to him  about adding the data from his Mana egg to the other four all ready available  at the moment."</p><p>Dr Alma took a moment to massage her aching head  before replying "Yes Professor I'll make sure to contact you as soon as I am  able."</p><p>Nodding the Professor stayed long enough to take a  few more reading before bustling out like a small tornado.</p><p>Heaving a sigh of relief that the little man was  gone, Dr Alma set about cleaning the mess he had created.</p><p>In another world, a young blond was sleeping  restless in bed. At present, she was experiencing a nightmare that had plagued  her for the last few days.</p><p>Usagi's eyes opened to a now familiar vista of  shifting greys, as with the other times she found herself covered in only a  blinding white aura of power. She turned her head slightly and leaned back into  the embrace of the shadow clad man who had appeared just as he always did and  leaned her head against his well muscled shoulder, giggling as his pigtail  brushed her noise. For what seemed like an eternity and a few fleeting moments  all at the same time they rested like this, happy in each other's embrace.</p><p>Then all too soon it appeared, a withered hand  massive in size seized up the man and threw him far from where she was. Moments  after this happened she felt her strength leave her and fell plummeting to the  ground only to awake to her mother's gentle voice asking if she was all right.  "It was just a nightmare mother," she replied as she had the last three days  then rolled over and once again tried to get some small measure of sleep. Her  mother looked down at her child with worry etched on her face before seeking  her own bed and trying to find slumber's grip.</p><p>Across town from the young  blond's restless repose, an equally young miko was awakened by feelings of  foreboding. As was her want, she set out to the temple to try to find out the  source of her distress by gazing into the sacred fire.</p><p>After kneeling in front of the  sacred fire, she began to go through the preparations required for the fire  reading. Slowly an image began to form, then suddenly it was as if she where  living the vision. Floating high above the city cast in greys where two beings,  power radiating from them in visible waves one of light, the other darkness.  Looking closely, she could see that taking the auras as a single whole they  formed a slightly marred Ying-yang symbol. As time passed the only feeling she  could get from the pair was that of great power and equally great contentment  at that which was. Suddenly the peaceful image was rent as a withered arm  reached forth from beyond and grasped the being of darkness wrenching it from  the embrace of the light and sending it somewhere beyond her vision. A feeling  of loss keen as a knife's blade bit into her heart as she saw that with its  other gone the being of light faltered and failed, plummeting to the ground and  a death that surely awaited it.</p><p>Rei was slow to bring herself  up from the vision's depths and once she was fully aware again she was shocked  to see that the dawn was almost upon her. Shaking off her lethargy, she quickly  rose and set about readying herself for the day, all the while hoping that  these actions would drive away the depressing end that the vision showed her.</p><p>And finally in a third place on this world something  was happening that would have had Ranma shivering in a corner if he had been  around and aware of its occurrence. For you see Akane was cooking, now most  people think that Akane's cooking turns out the way it does because of things  like her refusal to read the cooking book, this is wrong however.</p><p>As we look down on the scene of a pot of bubbling  darkness sitting on a stove, circling the pot we can notice three sets of eight  four inch tall robe-clad figures. The closest two of the rings are on their  knees facing towards the pot bowing repeatedly as they chanted, the outer tinge  is marching in perfect synchronicity also adding their discordant voices to the  chanting. Standing before the stove is an also robe clad Akane holding a tome  covered with some kind of pale pinkish hide with a set of wavering Eldritch  Runes on the main cover, that roughly translated meant "Cooking with Cthulu."  Therefore, as you can see in fact she cooks very well... if one happens to be a  Lord of the Underworld or some other hellish plain.</p><p>In addition to this already hellish scene, today  Akane was trying something extra special, just a few days ago she had concluded  that Ranma needed a thank you gift for all he had done recently. And as he was  supposed to be out training then by her calculations (and the augury she had  performed) he should be due in today at the very latest. Ok so sure, she  couldn't pronounce the strange gaijin name of the dish but it sounded good,  though why no one else liked her cooking she had no idea.</p><p>Yes, that's right Akane does taste her cooking,  likes it even, how and why.</p><p>Well you see on the first page  of the cooking book is a special recipe, after all you have to be able to taste  your food to make sure it has been cooked properly, correct? Well this  particular recipe changes a person so that they can withstand and even enjoy  the same things as those of a Cthuloid persuasion... pity she never tried  cooking it for Ranma, maybe then he might have enjoyed her cooking.</p><p>The cooking had been completed  a full eight hours ago and still Ranma had not appeared. To add insult to  injury Nabiki seemed to know something and knowing Nabiki it would be costly to  get the answer, well costs she could handle... not to mention she could always  take it out of Ranma's hide when she got her hands on him. Steeling herself for  the confrontation Akane pushed open the door to Nabiki's room wrinkling her  noise at the smell of the Divine that permeated the room she kept it from her  face as she walked over to where Nabiki was looking over some of her books.</p><p>"So, how much is it going to  cost me to find out what's happened to that baka."</p><p>She bit out, wincing at the  glower that shot her way at calling Ranma an idiot and just knowing that  whatever the price had been it had now doubled at the very least.</p><p>With a Feline stretch, Nabiki  closed the book she was reading, something in Egyptian by the looks of it,  Nabiki turned her smoky eyes to her younger sibling though how they where  related she had no idea.</p><p>"Well, sister dear. That's  really two questions you see, for the first half of the answer 600,000 yen,  cheap at twice the price I might add, for the second half however that's going  to cost you 200,000 yen and three favors of 'my' choice when ever I want them."</p><p>Akane winced at the favors  part, the money was simple enough to get, but the last time she had to do one  of Nabiki's favors it had cost her weeks of work and three of her pets (1).  Akane figured she could workout the second half of the answer with her own  sources. "I'll take the first part of the answer, the rest I can work out  myself. Same account as last time or another one?"</p><p>Nabiki smirked "The same one  will be fine sister dear, thought you might be surprised at how hard the rest  of the answer will be to come across." Nabiki was sure she would, she had  better anyway considering the work Nabiki's pawns had put into destroying all  evidence of Ranma's leaving the timeline. Though enough remained for him to be  able to get back, though anyone checking would be unable to workout where he  had gone let alone the fact that he had left at all.</p><p>Akane just snorted and pulled  a cell phone from somewhere and dialed a long string of numbers once it was  answered she barked a few words in an unearthly tongue and hung up. "You should  find everything is in order."</p><p>Nabiki's eyes grew dull for a  moment before she nodded and began to talk.</p><p>"From what I understand, three  days ago Ranma was contacted by someone who claimed to be able to help him find  a cure for his curse. This 'S. Meiou' as proof sent along a ring that would  hold off the curse's transformation for a total of six hours. The time limit  was used from the time the wearer is hit with cold water until they are doused  with hot water. The time is cumulative and it recharged at midnight. The ring  worked as stated, the next day Ranma left after leaving the information I've  passed onto you with me."</p><p>Akane's face turned dark. "So  that pervert's gotten cured and left us high and dry has he? Hah, typical. Hope  he rots." This said she stormed out of the room.</p><p>Nabiki watched as she left her  face passive, once the door closed he face became sad. "You really should have  forked over the rest of the price for a full answer, little sister. Oh well  guess that means it's up to me to take up the engagement when he returns. Oh  what hardships I must undertake for my family." This last part was said with  sarcasm dripping from her word's leaving it plainly obvious that she considered  it no hardship at all.</p><p>A sigh of relief and a  workstation was turned off. Bast hoped her plan paned out; she would hate  having gone to all the trouble of setting up prophetic dreams and visions if it  didn't. Shrugging an elegant shoulder she hummed to herself.</p><p>It was in the Fate's hands  now. After thinking this thought she cursed herself, just as a hand tapped her  on the shoulder.</p><p>Turning around, Bast once  again cursed herself as standing before her mallet on shoulder was Skuld,  youngest of the fates and the least likely to like what she was doing. Bast  calmed herself enough to speak and asked, "Yes, was there something I could do  for you Skuld?"</p><p>Skuld sighed and handed a  large sledgehammer to Bast. Bast cocked and eyebrow and asked "What this for?"  Skuld smirked "Just giving you something a little more subtle to use when  meddling in the lives of mortals." Skuld then turned on her heel and marched on  her way. Bast muttered to herself about bratty kids and suddenly felt a lot  more sympathy for Urd then she ever had to date.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the home of  Setsuna, much contemplation had been going on.</p><p>Setsuna had always understood  that her teacher viewed the Silver Millennium with little fondness and thus  would greatly favor something like it never again coming to pass. But what had  not come to her attention was just the level of dislike Tio maintained, looking  back on it, it wasn't all that hard to see why, considering Tio's kind where  originally designed to help in the overthrowing of a similar rule. All this was  what had caused her to pause and consider before putting Tio's plan into  action. After all the slowing of the flow of time was not something to be done  without careful consideration, something she could now indulge in without the  constant pain associated with Ranma's existence.</p><p>Therefore, she had spent the  three days since Ranma's eviction going over all the complications, factors,  and possible forces that may intervene and unfortunately, she had come to the  same conclusion at Tio: Slow the passage of time in the hope that Ranma would,  against the odds, find a way to return before Usagi fell in her battle with  Beryl.</p><p>Course set and resolve  unwavering, Setsuna faded from this plane of existence to appear at the Gates  of Time.</p><p>Long ago, at the dawn of  creation, there existed a race unlike any that would follow. This race found  power in belief rather then logic and facts as most others.</p><p>It was they who created the  Gates of Time so very long ago, and they who forged the pathways between  planets. No one knows what happened to this race, as long ago they simply faded  from existence.</p><p>Maybe they felt they needed  another place to dwell as new races began to spawn. Maybe some horrible  disaster struck them. Whatever the case, no one in this day and age knows and  few of the artifacts remain.</p><p>What most of this meant was  that Setsuna would have to find, hidden deep in the maze like halls of the  Gate, a room most often kept locked as being considered far to dangerous to let  any wander unknowingly into it.</p><p>Setsuna cursed, kicking a  snotling out of her way. She had always hated the little terrors that kept the  gate running, though they where far better then the few gretchin that seemed to  take a perverse delight in hiding in the most odd places, ready to jump out and  startle the unwary. Thankfully, she seldom had to deal with such beasts as they  only dwelled in the deep halls.</p><p>After minutes or years of  wandering (it was hard to tell, and didn't really matter anyway), Setsuna came  across a rickety door with "SEKRAT STUF, DO NOT ENTA – THIZ MEANZ YOU N00BZ"(2)  stenciled across it in florescent pink paint.</p><p>Pulling out a rusty key and  fitting it into the strange lock, Setsuna listened to the clunks and grinding  cogs, not even having turned the key yet. As the door swung open she saw a  dusty workshop cluttered with seemingly useless things, over in a cleared  corner were a set of twin leavers one bright red, the other a deep dark blue.</p><p>Setsuna stalked over to the  levers and gave the blue on a pull a display flickered alight reading "SLOW  TIME", and Setsuna nodded her head, still unsure why red things went faster.</p><p>As dawn stroked the rooftops  at Dight Village, there was a stirring in the Doctors Office. Ranma lay in bed,  peacefully as he had done three days previous, however something was different  today.</p><p>If you looked closely, you  might notice a flickering of black flame-like energy around his chiseled face  or across his muscled arms. As the day continued the energy seemed to ebb away  until around Seven. As the clock struck six minutes passed seven things started  to happen. In a massive surge the black energy flowed across Ranma, coalescing  into twin wings of pitchest black. Ranma's eye snapped open, the formerly  cerulean blue orbs now a single uniform void black.</p><p>With a massive leap Ranma  surged to his feet, scanning his surroundings, noticing he seemed to be inside  a doctor's office and that there was a really big guy with an equally big sword  standing in front a woman who looked to be the owner of this office.</p><p>After a moment of thought,  Ranma scratched his head and laughed uneasily the wings adorning his back  seeming to flow back where they came from as he did so. "Sorry about this, just  overreacted since the last thing I can remember wasn't a situation I wanted to  be caught unawares in, didn't mean to startle you. Oh, I'm Ranma Saotome by the  way sorry to be a bother."</p><p>Gadwin kept his sword drawn  for a moment longer until Dr Alma hit him in the stomach making him gasp for  air. "Now Gadwin, put that thing away, Hello Ranma, I'm Dr Alma, This big lunk  is the one who found you. Gadwin why don't you go help Ranma to the Inn, I'm  sure he must be hungry after four days without eating."</p><p>Just as Ranma was about to say  something his stomach roared it's thoughts on something to eat, laughing again  he mumbled something about that sounding like a good idea. As Ranma started  towards the door he seemed to sway, starting to fall, Gadwin moved quickly and  gave him a hand. "Look's like you might be a mite more out of it then you  thought, here lean on me and well get you something to eat."</p><p>A.N. Hmm shorter then I  thought it would be. Managed to get everything I wanted said quicker then I  thought I'd be able to. Oh well I've gotten Ranma awake, shown a few things  that I wanted, and set some things into play.</p><p>Next chapter: Leen makes an  appearance *near the end of the chapter* and some of the villains come out of  the shadows to make themselves known. ^_^</p><p>(1)   Best not to think of what said pets where, you might have  nightmares ^_^</p><p>(2)   Yes that's right, The gates of time where made by ORK's,  WAAAAAGH</p>
