</div>Ranma/NiGHTS into Dreams<br/>'Into Dreams'<br/>Ranma's first dream; 'The affection'<p>Ranma exalted in the feeling he hadn't felt since he was so young, before that fateful training trip. The incredible feeling that he was experiencing, as he soared as high as he wanted into the air, then dropped down low to just barely skimming the sands of the beach.<p>Ranma glided the loose sand , idly noting the bare footprints appearing in the sand from invisible feet , and finding it curious that there were no seashells on the beach. He rose into the air, allowing a stampede of eleven pale horses to run where he had been flying. A black horse trailed behind them, intensely trying to catch up, Ranma felt sympathy for it as it raced on.<p>Ranma glanced at the mingled white and red coral reef that jutted from the waters, while weaving through the unfinished houses that floated in the air. Ranma began to consider where he was; it seemed so familiar, like he had come here for a task. Fortunately, a voice inside reminded him of what he needed to do.<p>Ranma didn't go far before something caught his eye. A cluster of musical notes floated in the air, which Ranma sped towards and collected in one fail swoop. A small contented feeling told Ranma that he was doing what he had come here for.<p>Doing a tight loop in the air, Ranma shot to the ground. He stopped as he heard a 'shooping' sound, like air rushing to fill a vacuum behind him. Putting the mystery off, Ranma set to his task of finding a song that he could vaguely recall. He felt himself directed back to the sandy shore, meandering around the pieces of a large western game he recalled by the name of 'Chess' , and also noted that the invisible players were cheating severely in it . The event earned a chuckle from Ranma, who immediately hushed himself once he noticed the sound of it; like tiny bells and pan flutes. His laugh also attracted another, a gargoyle that had been perched atop one of the immobile chess pieces. It made a beeline for Ranma, who caught its approach and went to guard immediately.<p>The creature approached, and then dove for Ranma, who easily circled around it, finding the Saotome School of martial arts humorously appropriate in this combat. Ranma now got to see the phenomenon that the rushing air sound succeeded, as the gargoyle gave an indignant howl to being sucked into a pit formed from Ranma's loop in mid air. Ranma warily approached the spot, puzzled to where it had disappeared.<p>Again, an instinct within him told Ranma that he needed to hurry. Putting his newfound speed to the test, Ranma rushed off on a seemingly predestined path. Ranma floated between the chess pieces, avoiding their moves and collecting scattered music notes as he came across them with haste. Ranma encountered another one of the gargoyles, and dealt with it in the same manner as the other before. Ranma also found that looping around the notes attracted them to him, making their collection much easier.<p>The trail of notes lead from the shore to the crests, Ranma danced and flitted to avoid the waves from the sudden turbulent waters that matched the suddenly turbulent skies above. Ranma carefully avoided being swallowed into the water, collecting musical notes that were placed high and low, here and there. On top of having to watch for the high waves, the martial artist turned harlequin was forced to evade giant leaping carp that were intent on having him as a meal.<p>As if it grew extremely irritated at it's lack of success towards hindering the flying harlequin, the ocean rose into a massive tidal wave that rolled towards Ranma. The harlequin's eyes went wide as it saw the giant wave rise above him and began to descend upon him. Ranma felt himself swallowed in it, finding it impossible to gain his bearings as he was thrown about in the tumbling, angry water, he had began to despair as he was thrown head over heals, unable to recover himself. Without even realizing it, Ranma found himself surfing the massive wave on an anchovy that acted like a surfboard . Ranma maneuvered the crest, managing to collect the musical notes that were hung inside, all the time dodging the leaping carp that attempted to impede his way.<p>Before the wave crashed onto the shore, Ranma flew out from under it, performing barrel rolls in celebration of escaping such a potent trial. He once again spotted the black horse he had seen prior, but this time it was so far behind the rest that it almost had no hope of catching up. Ranma felt almost guilty because of this, but decided that the black horse really didn't belong with the rest of the pale horses.<p>Ranma flew towards a massive but ruined sandcastle , and set to explore it. Miniature cannons fired at him, though they were not a threat to one who could precariously drift in the air between the mauve cannon balls. Though the artillery was hostile, the drawbridge descended, seeming to beckon Ranma into its maw. Never one to disappoint, Ranma entered, unhindered.<p>Ranma was surprised to see the insides of the castle made of mirrors, that reflected everything normally, except himself, which his reflection was in various colors . He found himself quite angry at the yellow reflection .<p>Ranma flew through out its chambers, the mirrors warping as he flew by them, causing an aesthetic and pleasing ripple in them. Ranma noticed that though the space around him seemed empty, if he looked in the mirrors, he would see many musical notes, and when he looped their general area, they would appear and be gathered by the vortex for his collection.<p>"Impressive, Son-in-law. Your tactical mind seems to meet no bounds."<p>Ranma stopped flying, and looked around, only to find no one there. He wanted to call out for whom he knew it was to show herself, but felt deeply chagrinned at the sound of his voice at the moment.<p>"I'm right here, Groom." Ranma turned and looked towards a mirror, and saw almost cat-like Cologne riding on a crane .<p>"Or perhaps I'm right here?" Ranma turned to see another Cologne on a crane in the mirror opposite the one he was just looking at.<p>"Maybe even here," Ranma looked up at the ceiling in surprise, "I guess now this is the part where I am supposed to keep you from your goal, you prepared?" Ranma flew back a couple of feet warily. Cologne chuckled and faded from the mirror.<p>With out so much a warning, Ranma instinctually dodged a miniature tornado that flew horizontally towards him. He turned towards its origin in time to see Cologne smile and fade from the mirror. Ranma again dodged another tornado, and didn't even bother to pause, as he flew full tilt towards the mirror it originated from. Cologne barely had time to fade out as Ranma ran into the mirror she was currently in, causing it to indent, then spring forwards, sending Ranma flying away. Ranma's attempt at catching Cologne did not go unrewarded, as Cologne was spit out of the mirror and into the open.<p>Ranma moved to attack her, when suddenly, Cologne split into two, then four then six. Ranma found himself surrounded by a dozen Colognes riding cranes, circling around him and brandishing their staffs menacingly, he doubted the chicken leg would work once again.<p>Ranma remembered that he could fly, and flew straight up, much to his chagrin, the cranes began to flap their wings, and the circle of Colognes rose with him. He flew around, trying to make it difficult for the old woman to attack him while circling around him, and in a fit of desperation, looped. Many of the circle of Colognes were caught in the vortex, causing them to vanish, leaving the real Cologne present. The old woman quickly ran the crane towards a mirror, but didn't make it in time, as Ranma ran full tilt into the back of her. With a squawk, the Amazon matriarch was sent flying off the giant bird, and into the mirror.<p>Ranma flew in circles, anticipating an attack. Once again, a vortex of wind flew towards him, and he evaded. This time Cologne faded immediately after creating it, and Ranma grit his teeth, waiting for another attack. Out of the corner of his eye, Ranma saw Cologne reappearing in a mirror right before she could begin another attack. As Cologne started to spin her staff towards Ranma, she gasped as the harlequin started to fly straight for her. Cologne ceased her attack and tried to fade from sight, but once again didn't make it before Ranma rammed the window.<p>Cologne learned from the past, and used the momentum of the springing mirror to launch herself towards the one across it. Ranma had managed to recover in the air, and with a start forward on the old woman, created a loop that completed once she reached its center.<p>Cologne's eyes went wide, as she was absorbed into the vortex in space, and chuckled, "Not bad, not bad at all Son-in... Ranma." With that, she vanished.<p>Ranma quickly approached the spot he had seen the elderly Amazon disappear in, making sure that she had indeed disappeared. The harlequin felt something warm about him, and looked around to see musical notes floating from him. Ranma turned to see a giant music sheet, devoid of any music on its scales. The musical notes Ranma collected flew quickly towards the sheet, and covered it. Once they were all in position, music began to play from what sounded like a music box, replicating what was on the sheet. As the music played, everything began to go white...<p>Ranma grinned, and snuggled a bit more comfortly into his pillow, content that the rest of the night would be peaceful.<p>Ranma woke up much more early than usual, for some reason feeling so much more refreshed than he had in days. Though he felt quite a bit relaxed, his mood darkened a bit at the dream he recalled from last night. He was going to have to have a little chat with a certain Amazon Elder.<p>Ranma got dressed, and gave a curt 'good morning' to Kasumi, as he ran out the door, not even giving the eldest Tendou daughter time to return the greeting.<p>_<p>Well, it should be fairly obvious that this thing's littered with a whole nother story in it, anyone figure it accuratly enough? I wouldn't mind hearing *intelligent* interpretations of these dreams either.
