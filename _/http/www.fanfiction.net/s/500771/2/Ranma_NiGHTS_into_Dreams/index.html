</div>Ranma/NiGHTS Crossover<p>"Into Dreams"<p>Awake...<p>Ranma let out a silent scream as he shot up from bed. He had escaped the torturous hell that his own mind submitted him to every night, since after they returned from battling the Phoenix Tribe and Saffron. The pigtailed boy shook in remembered horror and frustration; they had won, the now infantile demi-god wouldn't be a threat for years to come, if ever. Akane was safe and among the living, despite how close of a call it had come to, the status quo is back to where it should be in Nerima.<p>Then why did he still feel damned?<p>_<p>Ranma drearily made his way down to breakfast, earning only a few concerned, yet terse glances from everyone else at the table.<p>"Oh my, Ranma, are you okay this morning?" Kasumi enquired as she set the plates out for the morning meal.<p>"I'm fine," Ranma lied, though as tired and bedraggled as he felt and sounded, it couldn't be disclosed if it were truth or not by anyone else.<p>Everyone else that is, other than Kasumi. The eldest Tendou sister gave the young man a concerned look, before returning to the kitchen.<p>Ranma looked around, and realized the absence of someone. He began to feel the panic that usually overcame him, the morning after the nightmare whenever he didn't see her almost instantly. Maybe it wasn't a dream after all, maybe he had failed the girl he lov... he deeply cared for.<p>Hiding his nervousness, Ranma inquired, "Wha, where's Akane?"<p>"She's in the bath still, I don't believe she had much sleep either," Soun stated, glancing over his newspaper.<p>"Boy, have you been keeping your fiancée up all night?" Genma asked sternly, peering intently at his son, "because I fully endorse it!" The bald martial artist produced a pair of victory fans.<p>"Oh, yes indeed! Though you may want to finish early on school nights, Ranma-kun," Soun threw in, only paying token attention to local matters.<p>"Oh my, Ranma. I'm afraid that isn't proper behavior. You should at least wait until you're married!"<p>Nabiki came down the stairs, dressed for school, and managed to catch the topic of conversation, "Or at least until prom night. You're off to a false start, Ranma."<p>"Hah? Prom?" Ranma inquired, minutely confused from the morning fog in his head. Akane happened to walk in at that moment, and heard Ranma's inquiry. A pit in her stomach that she had barely noticed made itself apparent to her, emptying her insides in favor of a hollow feeling.<p>"Yes, Prom, that big dance everyone in high school considers attending, that big dance that my dear little sister's been running herself ragged to prepare for? The one that's only three days off?" Nabiki continued to drop hints, after eyeing her younger sister's response.<p>"It's okay, really, Nabiki," Akane interrupted, trying to sound nonchalant about it. Only a completely dense fool could miss the hollow tone in her obviously faked sanguine attitude.<p>Ranma felt the anxiety leave him at Akane's voice; she was still with him. He then found it again once he saw Akane's face. There was a bit of disappointment there, from what, he could not place. It served to make him all that more nervous, "Is, is it because of me? What did I say this time?"<p>"Something wrong, Akane?" he said, as if testing the waters of a boiling lake. Akane seemed like she had been jolted from a trance, and gave Ranma a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. Ranma focused on her dual orbs, noticing a lack of luster; onyx in blue light that had failed to be polished.<p>"I'm fine, Ranma, have you decided if you're going to go..." Akane's eyes flickered away from Ranma's intense gaze at them, "...or not?"<p>Ranma looked around pleadingly for help, none would be given, as everyone seemed to be on the edge of their seats for his answer. Ranma considered how Akane was acting, and found himself more than a little concerned.<p>"I should have known better than to trust in you"<p>Ranma blinked, and felt his chest clench, "What did you say, Akane?" His question was rather hesitant, and laden with a heavy undertone of weary caution.<p>Akane perceived Ranma's inquiry as evading her own question. The girl gave a sigh, before speaking again, "Never mind, Ranma. I think you'd be bored with a normal school dance anyway." Akane sat down, as her oldest sister arrived with the morning meal.<p>It was slightly more subdued around the table than previous, everyone seeming to absorb the atmosphere that was emanating from Ranma and Akane. It was common for the two to grouse, but there was something different. Akane didn't seem to fume as she usually did, and Ranma was extremely placid. Every so often the two would glance between themselves, each time just missing catching each other.<p>"He... is he ignoring me?" Akane thought, looking back from her fiancée to her meal. Suddenly she wasn't hungry.<p>"Excuse me..." Akane mumbled, removing herself from the table.<p>Ranma looked up in slight panic, anxious over what he had done wrong, "Akane?"<p>"I'm going on ahead to school," Akane replied, not turning to look at Ranma, "I'll see you there." Akane gathered her supplies, and headed for the front door, each step she took hammering something away in Ranma.<p>Ranma knew he did something, but he couldn't figure out for the life of him what it was. It was apparent to him that he managed to hurt Akane, but whatever it was, she kept it close to the vest. Ranma watched his fiancée during lunch from a distance, as she talked with her group of friends. She didn't seem to contain her usual sanguine attitude; her smile was strictly cosmetic, her voice held a completely forced cheeriness. The pigtailed boy focused closer, he could almost see Akane becoming... smaller, in a withdrawn sense.<p>Realization came to Ranma; he had to have done something truly terrible to do this to Akane. A reoccurring dream came to the fore of his mind, and began to hungrily eat further away at the seemingly infinite confidence of Saotome Ranma.<p>Akane listened to her friends at the edge of her conscious. They were animated and vibrant, talking about their plans for the upcoming dance; a stark contrast to Akane, whose participation in the chatter of her friends was token at best. She imagined that they were silently noting her flaws, and though on an intellectual level she knew otherwise, she couldn't help but feel as if she were being found wanting.<p>"I envy Akane; just imagine, Ranma in a tux!" one of the girls squealed excitedly.<p>Akane refocused at the mention of her name. She had caught the sentence, and almost smirked at the memory of Ranma in a white tux, standing at the end of a wedding isle, awaiting her.<p>Suddenly, Akane felt more elated than she had in weeks, since the dream started. Ranma was waiting for *her*! Not for Shampoo, not for Ukyo, but for her. It may have taken knocking him unconscious and dressing him while he was out cold...<p>That's just it, wasn't it? Akane knew that he wouldn't have willingly gone through it... for her. He had to be forced into doing so through physical subduing and bribery (the bribe not mentioned until later notwithstanding). It wasn't for her benefit. Akane knew then, that Ranma couldn't possibly want her. Things had become calm between them, with their fathers no longer pressuring the two together. The other two fiancées were giving Ranma a good amount of berth, but Akane knew it wouldn't last for long. Ranma would forgive them, no doubt, and once again they'll begin to slowly impose themselves between Akane and him.<p>"A-Akane? Are you okay?" Yuka drew the quietly sobbing girl into her arms, looking at her equally puzzled friends.<p>Ranma would have been compelled to do something, if he were in the area at the time.<p>Throughout the rest of school, Ranma's deduction had been made completely valid in his mind. Everyone at school had looked upon him with cold eyes, condemning him for whatever crime he had committed against his fiancée.<p>Akane's circle of friends formed a conclusion to the reason of Akane's breakdown; Ranma did something BIG. News, as usual about the couple, spread throughout the school. And again, as usual, everyone sided with Akane.<p>Ranma kept his head covered on the desk, feeling almost as bad as when he had thought Akane dead back at Jusendo. He decided he would rather wallow in his own misery, than face any of the accusing stares that he was getting occasionally from his schoolmates. He had been used to them before, but with recent events, they hurt quite a bit more.<p>Not too far, one person was elated at the state of affairs between Ranma and Akane. The girl with flowing brunette hair saw an opportunity appearing. She didn't quite know how to approach Ranma at the moment, but soon, he'll need a friend.<p>Akane kept her head down, not wanting to see the pity in anyone's eyes. She had cracked, she couldn't help it. It was like a pressure on her heart had been increasing, until she couldn't help but give it outlet. All she could do was ride the rest of the day out, and then get home and relax, maybe some intense training will help steady her nerves. Nobody bothered Ranma or Akane through out the rest of the school day.<p>"I'm home," Akane called out in a weary voice that told anyone paying attention how her day went.<p>"Hello Akane, do you know what's wrong with Ranma? He came home rather upset," Kasumi called from the kitchen. Her little sister's mood hadn't been lost on her, and she presumed it might have been something shared between the two. A bit of prying may help clarify things.<p>Akane didn't answer, worrying Kasumi even further. The eldest Tendou daughter stepped out from the kitchen to confront her little sister, and found her already heading upstairs.<p>Ranma had holed up in his room, saturating it with his own angst. His worry had grown steadily since getting home. Everyone knew it was his fault now, he had heard Akane arrive, and was pretty sure that know Kasumi was privy to whatever Ranma did to thoroughly upset her. Eventually the whole household would find out, he wouldn't stop it, he knew he had failed her, and deserved whatever beratement they would throw upon him.<p>Saotome's confidence continued to dwindle.<p>Brooding in his room had gotten old, but he wasn't ready to face Akane just yet. Ranma steeled himself out the door, just in time to meet face to face with Akane heading downstairs in her gi.<p>"Ra-Ranma..."<p>"Akane..." neither knew what to say after that, a palette of emotions thrown precariously onto a canvas, and displayed upon their faces. Akane was the first to find her voice.<p>"I... I have to go train," with that, the young girl quickly headed down stairs. Ranma raised a hand in consideration of stopping her, to find out what he had done wrong, but he just couldn't deal with any of the anger, betrayal, or sadness that his fiancée may feel.<p>Akane berated herself for running. She needed to confront Ranma, because the uncertainty was slowly consuming her. She needed to desperatly, but she wouldn't dare face the contemptuous look that he could have; looking down at the half-rate play martial artist that seemed to believe he had some sort of intrest in her.<p>He quietly went back into his room, and didn't bother to come out for dinner. Akane practiced until it was time for bed.<p>Akane lay in bed, fighting sleep, and berating herself for it.<p>"Ugh, it's just a stupid dream. Why is it bothering me so much?"<p>"Look at me, scared of a stupid dream, the great Ranma Saotome," Ranma thought snidely, staring up at the ceiling of his room. "Yeah, great. I can't even keep myself from hurting Akane" His thought became cooler and more agonizing the longer they went, "Maybe she's better off without me..."<p>Neither Akane, nor Ranma would know the time they finally submitted to slumber.<p>Akane pushed her way through the thick prom crowd, trying desperately to reach the light. They were much more dense than before, and their taunts and jeers felt much more deeply cutting than last time. Akane forced her growing insecurity down, and continued to swim through the ocean of people between her and her goal.<p>Finally, after much trial, she ran into the blue light that beckoned her like a savior.<p>Ranma fiercely fought off his father, Ryoga, Cologne, Happosai, and others that impeded his run for sanctuary, the light that lay just beyond him in a slight distance. He failed Akane, but something told him that he would find salvation if he could just reach the light. Akane had already scorned him in her death, but he would keep fighting for her. Slowly dragging the chain he was wrapped in, and fighting against the combined might of his foes trying to drag him back towards misery; Ranma stumbled through the portal to another realm.<p>Ranma/Akane found him/herself in a land that was so breathtaking. The beach/flowered field Ranma/Akane found him/herself in left the pigtailed boy/raven-haired girl in awe. It was a glorious contrast to his/her prior predicament that almost seemed to wash away his/her current pains. Ranma/Akane noticed his/her attire, he/she was wearing his favorite red and black outfit/ her school uniform, and found that there wasn't anything else he/she would have preferred to wear. Ranma's/Akane's observations were cut off as they noted a squad of fantastic creatures heading their way, beings only found on the edge of a dream. Ranma/Akane looked for a direction to flee, and saw on a sandy dune/flower dressed hill a parasol with a harlequin that seemed to be trapped within it.<p>The jester's large and expressionate eyes pleaded with Ranma/Akane, as it spun around and flipped in its confinement, ignoring the laws of physics as a dream only can. Ranma/Akane rushed/wearily approached it; the pigtailed boy/short-haired girl knew it was his/her duty to help those in need. Without hesitation/with heavy caution, Ranma/Akane attempted to punch through/reached out a hand to feel the barriers of the captive's confinement. To his/her surprise, Ranma's/Akane's fist passed right through it/hand pushed easily through it, causing/allowing him/her to stumble forward/push her arm through. The harlequin quickly reached for Ranma's/Akane's outstretched fist/hand...<p>The jester's voice sang akin to a whistle with an optimistic tune, as it shot into the air, spinning in gleeful and joyous freedom.<p>_<p>Prepare to Fly
