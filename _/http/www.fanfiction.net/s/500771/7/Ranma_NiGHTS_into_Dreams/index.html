</div>Ranma/NiGHTS<br/>'Into Dreams'<br/>Ranma's Second Dream; 'The Precaution'<p>Ranma flew around the dark building that saught to impede him with a frown. Once he was freed from the parisol, he was immidiately disorientated. This dream was not as vibrant or cheerful as his last one, in fact the whole scene had an air of gaurdedness about it. The landscape of the dream realm was that of a massive city that was barely lit. He would had been rather inhibited, if it were not from the light coming from the mirroring city that was upside down in the 'sky'.<p>The two cities were linked every so often by skyscrapers that connected between them, seeming to have foundations in both the 'ground' and the 'sky'. Ranma decided to fly closer to the lighted city, and as he ascended, everything reversed on him to where the city in the 'sky' had become the 'ground', and vice versa. Not only that, the lighted city had then became dark, causing it's buildings to seem like they were descending into the abyss that held unknown answers and experiences, while the city that had been dark came alight.<p>The buildings themselvers were odd, as they were not straight for the most part. They would begin to angle at a sharp ninety degrees, and tightly turn in every direction like a network of plumbing. Ranma flew around them with a casual grace, as he saught his goals.<p>He flew straight, searching for any clues to the wherabouts of the musical notes he searched for. He had not any clue as to where they could be, unlike previous dream. Before he could despair, he caught a faint tune, coming from below.<p>Without much more to go on, the harliquin looped, and shot down to the ground. The building foundations seemed to get farther and farther away, but he wasn't intending to meet the ground. It wasn't before long that he found his bounty; a musical note.<p>He gathered it, and then heard a faint note ahead of him. It didn't take much consideration to realise he needed to 'follow the music'. He flew straight, meandering around the buildings that attempted to impede him, and found a second note near a department store that displayed spatulas, gymnastics tools, and outfits that a certain amorous Amazon tended to wear.<p>The Harliquin turned around, listening intently for another note, while he idly circled an aggressing enemy without much care. The almost inaudible sound came from his left, and headed towards it. He passed by the Tendou Hotel, and felt nervous as he did so that made him fly that much faster to put some distance between him and that building. He arrived at the note and gathered it. He didn't take long to determine the next location of the note was above him in the inverted city.<p>He flew straight upwards, weaving through the pipework buildings, and noted that it wasn't the citys that switched places when he got closer to the ceiling, it was him, or rather his perceptions that did. With that in mind, he approached the darkened ground, trying to find the note. He came upon it, and felt a warmth radiating from somewhere near him. He searched around, until he came to the source; the Bank of Akane.<p>The harliquin smiled wistfully at the building, but decided that he needed to continue his mission. He went along, collecting the musical notes as he heard them. He had to return to the other city to gather the rest, and as he was ascending to the other city, caught sight of Tokyo Tower in the distance. It wasn't quite Tokyo Tower, as it never came to a point, instead would narrow down to its thinnest point that was exactly halfway between the cities, and then widen out into another base that connected with the opposing cityscape. Every note he gathered was leading him towards it. If he had been paying attention, he would have noted that he was being lead around the city in a spiral to gather the notes.<p>Every so often, he would experience a new emotion, as he passed a building that did not share the particular 'unimportant' sensation most the others did; like how the hospital gave him a feeling of assertiveness that he lacked with many of his aquiantances, while the fortress firing cannonballs at him made him feel a more than slight pang of guilt. He shook off the emotion, and idly dodged the cannonballs hurling towards him, while not realizing their benificial aspects. It wasn't long before he arrived at his destination, and dove into the trainstation that was at the base of the psuedo-Tokyo Tower.<p>He barely caught the train with the barge for the locomotive by its tail, and was taken with it as it sped down the underground tracks. It came above ground, and the further it took him, the better he began to feel. The streets were no longer dark, as they were now lit by the lights of the train, which seemed to be a catalyst for the street lights along its drive. Musical notes wizzed by, and suddenly would be caught in an imaginary vortex that would drive then to the tail of the train and be gathered by the harliquin hitching a ride.<p>Suddenly, the speeding train made a quick and tight turn, snapping Ranma into the air. He had little control over his momentum, especially as he was being sent tumbling in the air, but he managed to maneuver himself enough to intercept to floating music notes along the way. he began to descend from the slight arc, and was sent crashing into a modest restaurant hole in the wall.<p>Slightly chagrinned, he pulled himself up from the base of the serving counter he had landed against, barely missing laying his hand on the seemingly burning grill. The restuarant proprietor cheerfully looked up to greet the new customer.<p>"So, what would it be, Suga..." Ranma blinked, as the jester figure in a navy blue parka that had triangular tatters cut on it, sporting a familiar face holding a spatula it was just using to scrape up the okonomiyaki it was prepping up for no one in particular. Ranma shrunk back, when he noticed the lack of arms that connected gloved hands holding cooking utensels. After the jester recovered from its shock, it managed to speak in a tinny, echoing version of his childhood friend's voice, "Ra-Ranma?"<p>He wasn't about to embarrass himself with that 'voice' he now carried in the dream, but he was no less surprised, and wanted to shout out the name of the person he knew was in front of him. Suddenly, the jester became nervous, and looked behind it. Ranma followed Ukyo/Jackal's gaze to the music sheet on the wall behind her.<p>Ukyo/Jackal's face became set in determination, as she/he pulled out a handfull of throwing spatulas. The Okonomiyaki restuarant suddenly warped into a surreal version of a courtroom, and the wall the blank music sheet was on drew back away into the far distance.<p>"Ranma, forget about it," Ukyo/Jackal warned menacingly, with an edge of pleading in her/his voice. Ranma began to pout, once he realized his friend was going to oppose him, and moved quickly to fly by her.<p>The harliquin's opponent was a bit quicker, as it already began to glide backwards, and launch a series of throwing spatulas at Ranma. As they both flew towards the music sheet, the wall it was on kept moving backwards just as fast as they were flying.<p>"Ranma, please, just forget about it," Ukyo/Jackal pleaded again, while launching another barrage. Ranma despaired at the desperation in his opponent's voice, but knew that it was important that he succeeded in his task. He weaved through the barrage, and pushed himself to move faster.<p>Ukyo/Jackal's face grew angry, "So, you would throw away our friendship? For what? Do you even know?" Ranma caught the bitterness in Ukyo's voice, but also found the cunning manipulation in Jackal's tone. He pushed forward, ignoring the deep cutting question, focusing on retrieving the music sheet.<p>"Ranma, if you do this," Ukyo's voice was tightly controlled, though a sob escaped, "Things will be different. We won't be able to go back." Ranma did not know what Ukyo/Jackal was referring to, but he already knew that the consequences of his actions would be irrevocable.<p>"Ranma..." Jackal began to growl, "You're messing with forces beyond your understanding." Ranma kept flying, but could not get closer, much less ahead, of his advisary. Nor were they coming any closer to the music sheet he desperately saught. The harliquin almost growled, mentally cursing the spatulas thrown at him for impeding his progress.<p>"Ranma, I love you, please... don't do this to me!"<p>Tag<p>Ranma's concentration was shaken, and a spatula found it's mark. Ranma was sent tumbling backwards, being pushed further away from Ukyo/Jackal and the goal. The Harliquin suddenly noted something bizarre, and tossed away the spatula that was as large as his own body away that he had caught in his hands before it struck completely home.<p>Ukyo sighed in relief, as Ranma turn and fled to the distance. Before a smile graced their face, Ukyo/Jackal sensed a feeling of... apology...<p>From behind them.<p>"NO!" a voice that was clearly not Ukyo's shouted out, as their opponent slammed into their back like a bullet. Jackal was pushed forward, dumbfounded on how the harliquin managed to get behind him. As he was jolted, he left behind a transparent Ukyo in his wake; Ranma was spared the distraught expression on her face, as she vanished.<p>Ranma sighed in hollow triumph over his advisary; he felt that things with Ukyo would now be changed forever. He hoped he hadn't lost his best friend, but what he did had to be done.<p>"Curse you Ranma," Jackal rasped out, and then shouted in a firmer voice, "Curse YOU... NiGHTS..." With that, he vanished.<p>Ranma blinked at the discorperation of the red, yellow, and white jester, and saw the music sheet now down the hall from him; somehow managing to change to once again being in front of him. He flew towards it, as the music notes he gathered began to swirl about him. Once he was close enough, they rushed to the sheet, and arranged themselves on their own accord...<p>Reala watched, as his associate returned from his defeat with his tail between his legs. It was easily apparent he would fail in the beginning, attempting to use the boy's emotions against him was a weak effort at best. Direct confrontation would be what decides the fate of their plans.<p>Zmartwan also underestimated the girl, but Reala graciously attributed that to her attentions being divided. He would never think his current maste... current soliciter incompetant, of course! Never!<p>"Well NiGHTS," Reala said with a feral and menacing, yet haughty cheer in his voice, "I will be the one that deals with both your two chosen. Do not think you can best me this time."
