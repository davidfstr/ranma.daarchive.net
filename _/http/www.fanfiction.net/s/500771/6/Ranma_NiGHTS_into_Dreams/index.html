</div>Ranma/NiGHTS<br/>'Into Dreams<br/>Akane's Dream ; The Hope<p>A purple streak zoomed to the heavens, and looped around before coming to a stop. Akane turned around, her eyes alight at the scene around her. Dazzling lights lit a dusk sky. Various fair rides cluttered the ground, and were running regardless of no one to maintain or ride them.<p>To her sight, the carnival seemed to go on forever into the distance, and unfortunately, she knew off in the distance is where she had to go. Akane started to fly foward, only to have a balloon rise and push her off-course. The sky had suddenly grown thick with the rising balloons that attempted to hinder her.<p>Fortunately, they were not as thick closer to the ground, so the harlequin took the lower route, while weaving and looping around the balloons. She reached near ground level, and darted over the blue road and around the rides. Akane stopped at a merry-go-round, looking curiously at the cone-headed cherubs that giggled with joy, as they rode around in circles. Akane found herself chuckling at the cute sight, and barely noticed the weeping coming behind her.<p>She was too late to avoid the aligator creature bumping into her, and nearly sending her sprawling along the ground...<p>Akane lay peacefully in her sleep, a smile adorning her face that came easily in dreams than it did during the day. Suddenly, she twitched, and her smile faded.<p>The harlequin blinked, when she felt a haze pass over her suddenly. It was the same feeling she got, right before she woke up last time from the dream. Akane realized what these creatures were attempting to do, and something inside her told her that she needed to practice a lot more caution, and that their time was now a bit more limited because of her carelessness.<p>Keeping her body facing the aligator creature, Akane made a tight loop around it, causing a vortex to form around it, and sucking it from her conciousness. As soon as she had done away with her attacker, Akane sped down the path towards the other end of the carnival, maneuvering through the mandalas that a part of herself insisted that was required. The road lead to a roller coaster that seemed like it would take her partways to the other end.<p>With barely a thought towards it, Akane flew to the front of the currently departing coaster, and quickly buckled in. Much to her chagrin, the buckle could not be secured, contrary to what it appeared to have done. The coaster jolted immidiately to top speed, and Akane rolled out of her seat, just barely being able to grab the back of the roller coaster's tail car.<p>She hung on as tightly as she could, as she was pounded by the wind in her face. She flopped like a flag being drug at hyper speeds, and was just as ready to be ripped from its support. The harlequin suddenly found that she could angle herself to ride more smoothly, and reduce a bit more of the resistance against her. The roller coaster seemed to take offense to her hanging on, and it's path became more winding and twisting in attempts to shake her. Akane would have none of that, as she held steadfastly to it with strong determination.<p>Finally, the roller coaster seemed to have enough of the girls impudence, and turned sharply, sending her flying from the wiplash turn. Akane tumbled head over heels in the air, until her back braced against something. Over her shoulder, she saw a kite against her back. The kite suddenly started flying on it's own accord, giving Akane bery little maneuverability over it. She looked down a ways, to see a ghostly looking figure holding the string that was attached to the kite, and taking her wherever it decided she needed to go.<p>Akane had to shift herself side to side, back and forth to avoid the balloons rising towards her, since she knew if enough connected with her, the kite's string would snap, and carry her away. She knew if that were to happen, consequences reaching beyond the dream would be dire.<p>Not too much sooner, up ahead she saw a floating dome, much like the one she saw in her previous dream, exept the glowing sphere in it was a brilliant white. She saw her objective, now she needed to know which other way to go.<p>The kite she was riding against came to a stop, and started to descend, allowing Akane to pull herself from it. Now she had no idea where to head, and looked around. The pathway was congested to her, yet no one was around. Akane could not comprehend how she was feeling so crowded, but the sensation was becoming clausterphobic to her.<p>Before the panic could grow, someone, or something caught her eye. The ghostly figure that was flying the kite she was against, was pointing in a direction for her. The harlequin girl nodded to the epheral being with the red shirt, black pants, and pigtail, and flew in the direction it pointed.<p>Akane soon found herself in front of a towering carnival 'test your strength' guage. She would have, if given the time, tried her luck, but as she looked around, she could not find the mallet that she would have had to use.<p>"IDIOT!"<p>Akane quickly spun around, and her eyes widened. Behind her, stood a giant Akane wearing a yellow sundress, glowing with a blue violent aura, and holding a hammer over hear head. Akane sensed a perfume she sometimes wore, acacia, and found it to have signifigant meaning on the warped image of herself.<p>The harelquin Akane took action, right before the hammer descended upon her, and looped around her double. The other Akane smirked nastily when the vortex did nothing to her, and raised the hammer to strike again. The harlequin was caught uprepeared for a sideways blow, that sent her tumbling in the air...<p>Nabiki groaned, and looked at the wall that was between her and her sister's room. Sometimes she wished her sister wasn't such a forceful sleeper.<p>NiGHTS Akane regained herself in the air, and took a deep breath, she didn't think she could take any more of those hammerings, but knew she had to somehow subdue her double.<p>She zoomed back, and rammed her doppleganger, once again yeilding no results. The giant Akane barely missed with her mallet, as the harlequin dashed back out of it's range. NiGHTS Akane came into range of the hammer, and was making a steady circle. The mallet slammed into where she once was, and was caught in the vortex.<p>NiGHTS Akane was growing fustrated at not being able to get any results; not even her mallet could be directly harmed. She passed around her double, looking for any sign of weakness as the hammer constantly was swung at her.<p>"JERK! WHY DON'T YOU STAND STILL AND FIGHT?" NiGHTS Akane blinked; why hadn't she ever realized how rediculous that sounded before?<p>After quite a bit of contemplation, it finally came to Akane's attention, that her double was standing between her and the test your strength game, possibly for a reason.<p>Akane came to a conclusion; the girl was holding the mallet. The harlequin flew right under the giant Akane's swing, and then shot straight up as it came at her sideways. NiGHTS Akane flew down and landed on the lever, and began to make faces at the giant version of her.<p>The other Akane's expression grew more fierce and redder by several levels, and she raised the mallet high above her head, "DIE YOU JERK!" As the hammer descended, NiGHTS Akane dashed off the leverage, and waited for the other Akane to do her work for her.<p>The hammer stopped just a foot above the lever, and the other Akane turned around, wagging her finger at her smaller counterpart. The giant just barely missed NiGHTS Akane fly in an arch over her head, and slam into mallet head with as much force as she could muster.<p>The force of the blow was strong, and metallic cyllinder soared up the meter, and connected heavily with the bell at top, causing it to fall off. The giant Akane looked up with disbelief, and then dropped the hammer and screamed.<p>The Harliquin watched as the other Akane was squashed under the even more massive bell that didn't seem as large before, and both dissappear in a flash and sparks. In their place, was a set of musical bells that Akane gathered, and then raced off to find the floating dome. Frantically, in the back of her mind, she knew she had almost no time to make it. A few seconds later, she found out the reason why.<p>"AKANE!" A high pitched, but gender neutral voice cried out, as Akane, in her school outfit, fell from NiGHTS, and tumbled to the ground. She felt no pain as the ground yeilded below her, and she looked up for whoever called to her. By her, lay the bells still, and though she didn't have the clear reason any longer of why she had to get the bells to the dome, she knew it was a vital task.<p>She picked the musical bells back up, and she heard something ringing that was fast approaching. Winding through the game stands, came a fat phoenix with an alarm bells for eyes, and a clock in its stomach. In its talons, it carried a bucket of water. Akane knew without much thought what that was for, and ran with the bells as fast as she could. She had a vague notion of where to go, but not much more.<p>She heard another ringing approaching from the fore, and yet another from the side. Akane knew she had to deal with at least one of them, so that she would be in less danger.<p>The phoenixes all centered onto one spot, and flew there, looking for their prey. To their senses, she was right in that general area; if they had much of a mind, they would be extremely puzzled.<p>"KIYAAAAA!" Akane cried out, as she let go of the dozen balloons she had gathered on one hand, and while holding onto the musical bells with the other, she descended onto the phoenixes, sending them all crashing onto the ground.<p>The birds squawked and flapped their wings in order to get airborne, but by the time they managed so, Akane was a good deal out of range.<p>Akane turned over in her bed while trying to get more comfortable. The smile she was wearing from earlier in the dream was back, as her dream self listened to a chorus of bells play a private concert for her.
