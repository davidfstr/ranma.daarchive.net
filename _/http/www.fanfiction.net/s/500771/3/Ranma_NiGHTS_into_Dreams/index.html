</div>Ranma/ NiGHTS into Dreams<p>"Into Dreams'<br/>Akane's first Dream; The Befriendment<p>Akane attempted to laugh, but her voice had caught in her from the overwhelming feeling of excitement. The exhilarating feeling of flight had taken her so fully; all her troubles of the waking world had been left on the ground. Akane barrel rolled as fast as she could, then shot straight up into the air, then sharply dropped down, flipping herself to her upright position before she hit the ground.<p>She had now taken a look at her environment; it was, so simply yet eloquently put, beautiful and surreal. She rose higher into the air to see more. If the feeling of flying left her breathless...<p>Mountains that stretched to the crystalline blue and sparsely clouded sky surrounded the massive flower field filled with oversized daffodils and sunflowers. In the midst of it all, a mighty pine tree stood in the center, pristine and as perfect as any such tree could be found. Erasers for pencils rubbed out any flaws that could be seen about. Akane wanted to giggle when one of the erasers approached her, orbited around her, and zoomed on it's way, but found her laugh a lyrical and pleasant cluster of bell chimes and whistles.<p>Akane scrunched her face, as a flower pedal that was for a peculiar reason falling from the sky landed against it. She couldn't comprehend why the sight of such beautiful things that dwindled to the earth below upset her slightly.<p>Akane looked down upon herself. Her sleeves were cuffed with yellow and violet triangles, like the strange jester's attire she had seen only a few instances ago. She looked further down and saw herself in a leotard of matching violet, with the legs muffed in a lighter purple and blocked off at the top of the foot to the heel with a yellow tracing line. It was vested in purple at the chest with four yellow stars, two at each side. What really caught the transformed girl's attention was the glowing purple gem in her chest. Akane spun in the air, trying to look about herself to fully view the changes on her.<p>Before Akane could contemplate the transformation, she heard weeping. Akane looked up to see one of the fantastic creatures she had seen earlier, a small alligator with wings of a large fly, heading towards her. Akane lifted into the air quickly, as the creature got within range to attack. Like a darting fly, the beast quickly changed direction to cut her off. Akane looped back, just barely missing her foot being bitten off. To her surprise, a black hole appeared from where she had looped, swallowing her pursuer and placing it in parts unknown. Akane imagined she blinked, and smiled. The transformed girl made several more loops; sounds of shifting air accompanied the portals she created.<p>Akane decided to take more joy out of her flying, dancing precariously in the air without care, before she felt an urge, like another part of herself telling her she had tasks elsewhere. Akane looked off into the distance, and saw a rose pink sphere of radiance, trapped in a glass floating dome. It was slowly shrinking and losing it brilliant vibrancy, and Akane knew that the dome was siphoning it away until it was a withered shadow of what it used to be. Akane knew she had to stop it.<p>Akane dashed in the air towards the objective, delighting in the speed she traveled through the air, weaving through the floating mandalas, and indulging in the twinkle of the bells she touched. She reached the dome, and pushed as hard as she could, finding that the smooth glass would not budge. She resorted to pounding on it, and it remained just as stubborn. Akane backed off from the dome with a spin. From its reflection she saw her face. She had become the strange being she had found in the parasol. The soft and friendly eyes looked back at her with a twinkling of mirth, which seemed out of place from the comically small mouth she had that presently formed an 'o' from her surprise. Akane couldn't resist the urge to take her index fingers and stretch her mouth apart, wagging her tongue at the reflection. After a fit of bell twinkling giggles, Akane went back to the task at hand, finding a way to destroy the dome that held the beautiful orb of energy.<p>A thought came unbidden to the fore of her mind, "a song of joy will shatter the dome of sorrow." Akane didn't know what the reference was referring to, but rationalized that she needed to find a song. In the distance, a faint melody made itself known, and the girl-turned-harlequin flew in the direction it originated to investigate.<p>Akane found herself much more hindered by the mountains in her flight, but still almost effortlessly maneuvered through them. She found herself opposed to more creatures, such as a badger with grasshopper hind legs, and dealt with them in the manner she had learned; looping them and sending them into the black oblivion.<p>Akane cleared the mountains and dropped down low, skimming over the rolling sea of grass and flowers. A trail of flower petals that were spurred up from flowers was left in her wake, dancing in the air in the motions the wind currents lead them. She was approaching the sound of what appeared to be a violin playing en solo, but off key and in broken notes. She quickly hit breaks at the sight of who was playing the instrument rather poorly; a redheaded girl in a pink and flowery dress sitting cross-legged on a log in front of a dark and untidy looking fortress. Akane cautiously floated down to confront this dream Ranma-chan, when the girl noticed her and giggled, and then gestured to the violin she was holding.<p>Before Akane could respond, Ranma-chan laughed and started to run away. Akane blinked, then gave chase after the other girl. The farther she ran, the larger she became until she was overwhelmingly large. Akane noticed that the inside of the building was a long corridor of interweaving willow trees and leaking plumbing. Vaguely she could hear "do you want to be friends?" whispered in the background.<p>Suddenly, the giant Ranma-chan giggled and spun, flaring the skirt of her dress out and sending pansies and wilted yellow roses flying through the air. Akane dodged and weaved through the barrage, attempting to get close to the girl.<p>"Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken!" Ranma-chan cried out in a surreal voice, her oversized fists blurring beyond the visible realm. Akane fought against the wind generated from the attack, trying to keep stable in the air. As valiant as she fought, Akane couldn't help but be pushed into a wall made of faulty lead piping and sickly tree branches. She managed not to touch it, but felt the heat from it. Akane's already enlarged eyes opened wider, and her face became akin to a child's wonder and surprise; there was hot water in the pipes. She looked around and saw several valves that were slightly leaking, possibly extremely weak.<p>Akane smirked as she got her bearing straight, the trick may not be to attack this mock Ranma-Chan directly.<p>Ranma-chan started to run gleefully away again, sporting away the violin in her grasp. Akane caught up with the large redhead, and flew right past her. Ranma stopped and blinked in confusion, watching her playmate shoot past her instead of trying to take the musical instrument away. Akane flew into a valve, putting her hands forward, and breaking it off.<p>Ranma-chan yelped in surprise, dodging out of the way of the steaming stream of water that shot towards her. She spun again, flaring her dress and sending flowers flying about. The pansies altered the course of the jet of hot water, no longer making it a danger to the girl.<p>Akane now knew the girl was afraid of the hot water. She rammed into another valve, and once again Ranma dodged it, but this time much more narrowly. She again spun about, sending flowers around to protect her, and called out her attack to impede Akane. The harlequin would not be deterred, as she coasted against the wind and rammed another valve. Ranma just barely dodged it, and spun more flowers out. Again she was protected, but it was apparent she was now trapped, and running out of maneuvering room. Akane looked around, and plotted her next move. She quickly rammed another valve, ricocheting off and ramming another one, which in turn sent her on another course into a third valve. Ranma-chan managed to dodge the first two streams, but was enveloped by the third.<p>With a squawk of surprise, the girl dropped the violin. Akane swooped in and caught the instrument when it shrunk to size, and turned to see what happened to the other girl. In her place stood a handsome young man in a pigtail, nodding to her with a smirk, before fading away.<p>Akane looked around again, finding herself back in the flower field again. Without hesitation, she flew with the violin towards the dome in the distance. When she arrived, she felt the violin stir by itself. Startled, Akane let go of it, and it began to play. Its song was beautiful, uplifting Akane's mood even more as the concert of the single instrument went on. Under the melody, the dome began to buckle, then crack, then finally shatter; allowing the rose pink ball of energy to expand, and envelope the area...<p>Akane turned on her side and smiled slightly in slumber, feeling better than she had in a while.<p>The next morning, Akane felt more refreshed then she had in a while. Akane took her bath and headed for the table for breakfast. This time it was her who noticed someone was missing from the table.<p>"Uh, where's Ranma?" Akane enquired, trying not to sound too concerned.<p>"He said something about having to go to the Cat Cafe. He needed to talk with one of the Amazons.<p>"Oh," Akane replied in a small voice, Ranma must have gone to see Shampoo. With her sigh, a tiny ember of the negative feeling she originally felt began to grow again within her heart.<p>_<p>_<p>Yeah, I'm pretty sure you noticed the sheer amount of symbolism in this now, and as to the reason this will probably be an Akane/Ranma matchup. As to what the symbolism means, and how it is implied, I'll leave it to you guys to discuss until I decide to post the expanations later (yeah, I know I suck, but some of you gotta learn to think for yourselves, and a lot of it isn't that complicated)<p>Ranma's dream is next.
