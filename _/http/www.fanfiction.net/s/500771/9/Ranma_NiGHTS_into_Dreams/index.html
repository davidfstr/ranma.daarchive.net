</div>Ranma/ NiGHTS<br/>'Into Dreams'<p>NiGHTS found himself over a vast lake surrounded by massive trees that towered so high that only the pale moon in the twighlight sky shown through. Ranma spund around, trying to find his bearings, and found that he couldn't even comprehend what his goal was this time.<p>"Hello NiGHTS..."<p>Ranma turned to find a more sinister looking Harlequin floating above him, and dropped down to the waterlevel to gain some distance in case he attacked.<p>"If you're wandering where the music notes and sheet are, I took the liberty of collecting them for you," Reala smirked towards NiGHTS, "Your task will be all that more simple, all you have to do... is take them from me..."<p>Akane looked around the lake in the night, confused. She had no idea what she was supposed to do; even that part of her that had known what her tasks always were seemed to not have an inkling of what was to be done now.<p>"Confused, NiGHTS?" Akane looked ahead of her, to see another harlequin approaching her with a casual glide in the air, "Well, don't be any longer, I have the instrument you're looking for safe. If you want it, you'll just have to... persuade me to give it up..." NiGHTS eyes grew irritated at the rival's mirth at Akane's expense.<p>Both Nightmarens were skimming their toes over the surface of the lake, sending fine diamonds and dust the color of clean mist in the late dusk spraying in their trails. Ranma was flying backwards, leaning away with his arms dangling; and facing Reala, who had his arms crossed and leaning forward in balance.<p>"I'll warn you that your chances this time of defeating me are unlikely," Reala started to explain to Ranma/NiGHTS, "We both know I'm much more powerful than you, and you do not have the advantage of a human host this time."<p>NiGHTS eyes reflected their confusion. "Oh, it wasn't hard to find a way to even things up, Ranma Saotome seems to have his fair share of rivals, and it didn't take much to convince this one of his assistance."<p>"After all, any chance to fight Ranma is a chance I can't pass up..." Ranma/NiGHT's eyes went wide in realization. Even though they didn't speak, their silence announced their suspicions in volumes.<p>"Got it in one, Ranma" Ryoga/Reala replied with a fanged grin.<p>From the surface of the lake, the two rivals started to glide up skywards slowly, "So, Akane you thought that you would gain an advantage over me in dreams? Well, into dreams I would follow you if it meant taking my Ranma back from you."<p>Akane/NiGHTS looked at Reala confused, trying to place who this may be. Reala seemed to cherish the confusion in their eyes, "Oh? You are having problems figuring out who is my own host? I do have to admit, I probably sound much more intelligent without a language barrier impeding my speech."<p>Akane/NiGHTS eyes narrowed, "Yes, Akane, I'm here to show you just how inferior you are, and this time, have the descency to stay down!"<p>On a silent signal, both of them squatted while they were gliding across the water, as if ready to lift off. And in unison, they lifted off in opposite directions; kicking up water in their blast-off. A few seconds later, in the background, a streak of violet was heading on a collision course with a streak of deep crimson. When they met, a brilliant explosion ensued...<p>Akane/NiGHTS and Shampoo/Reala accellerated into the air, and then both suddenly started to pull away. They looped in opposite directions, and then suddenly shot forward towards each other. Two vortexes formed in the air, just as they passed by each other...<p>Ranma and Ryoga were locked against each other like two stags trying to overpower each other. They both met force against force, refusing to give any in the air to each other as their hands were locked together.<p>"Heh, Ranma, you think you'll come out on top of this one?" Reala growled in their lockup, "this fight can go either way, you know? Just like your little battle with Saffron.." Ranma blinked, and the sudden shock given to him allowed Ryoga to get the upper hand. Ranma was sent tumbling in the air after being caught in Ryoga/Reala's vortex. He felt himself almost being sucked from NiGHTS, and knew too many more of those and he'd be pulled from the harlequin, ending their battle.<p>Ryoga looped back towards Ranma, forcing him to shoot into the air, lest he be rammed. Ranma then shot down to the surface, and turned back towards Ryoga, mustering all the determination he could.<p>Both Shampoo and Akane were sent tumbling from each other's vortexes, having been caught in each one's as they passed. Akane managed to get her bearings back first, as she darted towards Shampoo, aiming to loop her again. Shampoo glided back, and attempted an under loop, which Akane quickly shanged directions ninety degrees, heading straight down, as Shampoo went straight up. Akane turned and headed left, while Shampoo headed right, and then they both turned towards the other to fly at each other at an  attempted to spiral around Shampoo, using her outstretched hand to start the loop, while her feet finished it.<p>Shampoo arced over the small vortex, and sharply turned back towards Akane, giving chase...<p>A violet vortex would immidiately follow a crimson one, and vice versa, as Ranma and Ryoga attempted to catch one another in a highly acrobatic aerobattle. Ranma pulled away and down from Ryoga, as Ryoga/Reala attempted to spiral ram Ranma and then loop him. Ryoga sharply turned and followed, right into Ranma's trap, as he sharply bounced off the surface of the water, then turned back up, and then back, forming an almost triangular loop.<p>Ryoga/Reala tumbled back to their starting point, and growled in a dual voice, "Not bad, Ranma/NiGHTS. But do not think that you'll win this one. There's more at stake than you imagine, and I will show you why it is you will ultimately fail."<p>Reala shot towards NiGHTS, and Ranma met Ryoga's charge head on. Suddenly their martial arts skills became involved, as they both traded blows with one another in a space of a second, would break away, and then arc back toward each other to begin again.<p>The third rebound toward each other, Ryoga suddenly pulled away, causing Ranma to overconpensate. As Ranma/NiGHTS attempted to regain his balance, Ryoga looped him again.<p>Ranma turned himself back upright at his starting point, and turned to glare toward Ryoga. "Heh, you should realize that your victory against Saffron had little to do with your ability, Ranma," Reala sneered, "it had all to do with your luck. Well, now... *I* control all the luck!"<p>Reala darted down towards NiGHTS, and Ranma quickly darted away. Ryoga couldn't gain any ground on Ranma, and started to grow fustrated. Ranma suddenly made a horizontal loop near the surface of the water, causing a vortex to form, and pull water from the lake into the air. It proved enough of a distraction for Ranma to double back, and loop Ryoga.<p>They were in a stalemate; as long as Akane kept flying away at high speed, Shampoo couldn't catch up with her. Akane knew this wouldn't do either of them any good, and turned back up. This proved a mistake, as Shampoo suddenly bounded off the surface of the water; turning a shaper angle without losing any of her momentum to ram NiGHTS in the back. Without any bearings in the air, she fell easy prey to Reala.<p>Shampoo tsked towards Akane who was gaining her bearings back at her starting point, "Honestly, Akane, I don't know what you think he sees in you. You can't cook, you can barely fight, and people told *me* I had a bad temperment." Reala managed Shampoo's usual catty grin, "One more, and you're done."<p>Akane felt her inadequacies starting to knaw at her determination, but she hardened herself, and flew at Shampoo again. Reala sniffed in distain, and flew towards NiGHTS. Shampoo attempted to ram Akane head on, but the other Harlequin quickly pulled up and turned herself upright. Once in position over Shampoo's back, she lifted off, driving most of her momentum into Reala's back.<p>Shampoo managed to stop herself before she was plunged into the water, just in time for Akane to take advantage of her redirected attention.<p>"NiGHTS, you are trying my patience!" Reala shouted, and dashed right into NiGHTS in an tackle in mid air. NiGHTS managed to pull himself from his rival, forcing them to interlock hands. Once again they were both forced into an aerial grapple, but it was apparent that Ryoga had the advantage.<p>"Now, to finish this..." Reala/Ryoga, while still holding Ranma/NiGHTS hands, began to loop, with their rival being in the center of it. Ranma/NiGHTS realized their plight, and suddenly began to loop in counter-balance. The one who would be the victor would be the one that completed their loop first while their hands were joined, and Ryoga had the head start.<p>Right before Ryoga completed his loop, Ranma quickly swung his legs back, arcing his body, and completing his loop.<p>Shampoo seemed to have doubled her determination, almost looping Akane at every turn, attempting to overwhelm her opponent. In Akane's confusion of Shampoo's tactics, she missed her opponent descending down from above her, driving her knees into her back.<p>"That wasn't very nice, Akane," Shampoo/Reala growled, as they watched their rival plunge into the water's dark depths. All they had to do was wait for Akane/NiGHTS to resurface, and loop her as she came out. Easy victory.<p>Akane/NIGHTS suddenly shot out of the lake, a stream of water around the violet streak like a jet from a geyser. Shampoo/Reala smiled in victory, and looped the top of the stream, sucking it into a vortex. She missed Akane, who had stopped herself in the air halfway down, smiling in her impending triumph...<p>Ryoga rolled over, and then sat up. He was back in the guest room on the Unryuu farm. He looked around his location a bit, and then yawned and rested his head back on his pillow.<p>"Good fight," mumbled, before drifting back to sleep.<p>"NOOOO!" Shampoo sat up screaming. She couldn't have been defeated by Akane, she just couldn't have. Off to the side, Cologne watched her Great-Granddaughter. Even Shampoo didn't realize what all truly was at stake during her dream fight, but the Amazon Matriarch knew.<p>Once Shampoo calmed down, she would tell her heir that they would need to prepare to leave back for China soon.<p>"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooo*"<p>NiGHTS watched as Reala vanished completely into the loop, signaling the harlequin's victory. NiGHTS began to form acrobatics in the air in celebration, when...<p>Akane turned, and in the distance saw a pigtailed boy performing amazing aerial feats...<p>Ranma turned, and saw a raven-haired girl celebrating for some unknown reason.<p>And they awoke to a new morning
