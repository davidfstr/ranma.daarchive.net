</div>The Light Hawk War<p>By: Chaos Lord<p>Disclaimer: The characters in this story belong to their respective owners.  The concepts dealing with the Time Gates the Ultimate Good and Evil and the Forbidden belong to PacMan.<p>********<p>Chapter 7<p>********<p>After leaving the Tendo Dojo, the Senshi headed to the Hikawa Shrine.  Once they reached their destination everyone split up and headed to their individual homes.<p>As Makoto headed to her apartment she made a stop. Her foodstuffs were running low and she needed to buy more for dinner. At the store she made idle chit chat with the other regulars who frequented her favorite market. Once she got to her apartment she entered and headed to the kitchen to deposit her purchases. As Makoto busied herself with the tasks necessary to make her dinner she looked around the apartment sadly.<p>If you asked any teenager they would gleefully jump at the chance to live on their own in a nice apartment. But to Makoto, living alone was a curse. There were days where she reveled in her freedom, but there were others, like today, were she would trade all of that for the loving embrace of her mother or father. Hell, even punishment would be fine since it meant that there was someone there to punish her.<p>As Makoto sat down to eat the meal she had prepared, her thoughts turned to one of the Emperor's guards. Now those who knew Makoto would never guess who she was interested in since he was so contrary to the men she usually goes for. Normally she would prey upon men who were good looking, some would say that she was being superficial but she wasn't. Makoto was looking for love in it's truest most pure form. When she was younger and shorter she had met a guy. He was two years older than her, and some girls say that he was the most gorgess specimen of maleness ever. He could have had any girl he wanted but he always ate with Makoto and soon she was in a relationship that was pure bliss. He was so gentle and his touches were confined to places that could convey his feelings yet allow Makoto to maintain her dignity. But alas it wasn't meant to last. Her ideal boyfriend had to move and leave Makoto forever. Since then she looked for attractive men to date in the hopes that she would be able to recapture the joy she had felt.<p>The guard that had caught her eye was not what one would call a pretty boy. In fact the scare that ran down the front of his face almost precludes the words petty boy. What he lacked in looks he made up with his eyes. Despite being red they held the same look as those belonging to her love from long ago. And as he surveyed the room in his search for some threat to his leader, his eyes would occasionally meet hers. What would happen next still increased her pulse. He would smile, not a huge smile that was full of teeth but a small roguish smile that said so many things yet said nothing at all.<p>"I wonder what his name is?"<p>*********<p>Usagi Tsukino did something so out of character for her that it had Luna expecting the apocalypse. She woke up early. On a Saturday. During summer vacation.<p>As the queen-to-be got up and prepared herself for a day with her new friends, she ignored Luna as she sat in a corner with prayer beads. She gathered her things and headed towards the bathroom, all the while thinking on yesterdays events. After a less than stellar introduction, Ranma and his friends seemed fine with them. Though one item about that meeting still troubled her, Ranma's reaction at having a Senshi guard him. He seemed reluctant to have their protection but that didn't make sense to her, wouldn't anyone feel better with the Senshi protecting them.<p>As she soaked in the tub, Usagi's thoughts turned from the meeting and rested on her favorite topic for thought, Mamoru. Since Galaxia, Mamoru has been a more active participant in their relationship. He'd come over to ask her out, was more open with his feelings. Because of this Usagi learned what her love's greatest fear was, a long term relationship. Or more precisely, the responsibility of maintaining the feeling that he felt for her for as long as they were supposed to be together. Sometimes he had trouble sticking with what he had set out for dinner.<p>Usagi's reply to that had been simple, "If you've loved me enough to die for me more than once, then you don't have to worry about not loving me." To back up this point Usagi engaged Mamoru in a rather energetic make out session. While they didn't go any further than making out, what they did do was enough to make Usagi blush.<p>After getting dressed Usagi headed downstairs and made herself some breakfast. When she finished pouring her cereal she sat down with her astonished parents.<p>Like Luna, Usagi's parents were shocked that their daughter was up so early. "Usagi dear, are you feeling ok," asked Mrs. Tsukino.<p>Usagi looked up from her food, "Sure I am." She tilted her head to the side. "Why, what's wrong?"<p>"Nothing honey, we're just not used to seeing you up this early during this time of year," her father replied.<p>"Oh. It's Senshi business." That was one good thing that came out of the entire Galaxia affair, her parents now knew that she was Sailor Moon. When she had returned home after defeating Chaos, Usagi was treated to a view of her mother uncontrollably sobbing while her father and brother vainly tried to calm her down. Usagi wasn't even able to get out a hello before she was enveloped in a bone-crushing hug. Apparently her mother had known that she had died and now that she knew Usagi was alive she demanded to know what had happened. Needless to say, they were surprised when they heard that she was Sailor Moon. After she told them the entire story they told her how stupid they felt at not seeing all the clues that were revealed over the years. Soon her parents calmed down and told her that though they don't like how she puts herself in danger on a constant basis they will support her however they could.<p>"It's not dangerous is it," Usagi's mother asked.<p>"No we just have to guard a guy that's supposed to save the world, that's all."<p>"Well, ok. You be careful and have fun."<p>*********<p>By eleven, all the Senshi but Hotaru were at the Shrine. Some were huddled around Ami's computer as she went over the scans she made of everyone at the meeting. The others were staying as far away from Haruka as they could. Now you may ask why such a close group of people would want to stay away from one of their members? Well to answer this question you have to picture Haruka in your mind. Now add a glazed expression a goofy grin and an occasional giggle and you have an idea what the Senshi of Uranus currently looks like.<p>The reason for Haruka's odd behavior is quite simple, the house was empty. As soon as Haruka and Michiru got home Michiru took advantage of the fact that there was no one home to bother them and jumped her. Haruka wasn't quite sure how they ended up in bed, all she knew was the next morning there was a line of clothes that extended from their front door to their bed. What got her was the first article of clothing at the door was one of her bras. It was a little known fact and one that Haruka would never admit to but when it came to bedroom acrobatics Michiru would undergo a startling metamorphosis. One moment she would be calm rational Michiru the next she would be love-crazy Michiru whose imagination knew no bounds. Nor did her energy.<p>Ami continued going over her findings until an alarm she had set rung. She turned off the alarm and closed her computer. As she stood up she placed the small computer into whatever spooky place that the Senshi stored things. "Well that is our signal to be leaving."<p>This immediately broke Haruka out of her Michiru induced stupor, "So, how do we plan on getting there?" She missed Hotaru and wanted to see if her daughter was ok. While she didn't think that anything bad would happen, she was still worried since she really didn't know the people Hotaru was staying with. Haruka had never intended to become a mother and she especially never considered the possibility of being a father since she lacked the equipment that usually came with that title. But now she couldn't imagine herself not being one.<p>"Well, we can always Sailor Teleport," answered Rei.<p>The rest of the Senshi were happy with that idea so Minako kept her mouth shut. But she didn't think that whoever owned the land that they would land on wouldn't be happy when it blew up.<p>*********<p>Minako's prediction proved true when they landed in the Tendo's backyard.<p>When Nabiki heard the explosion that came from the outside of the house she was instantly working on a bill for the damages. Soon after Ranma left the first time, Nabiki enacted a new policy. Whenever someone destroyed any Tendo property she would give them a bill for the damages. This quickly reduced the cost of repairs and the amount of people breaking down walls. When she reached the site of the most recent explosion, she hesitated a moment when she saw that the cause for the damage was the Sailor Senshi. But her hesitation was short lived because if she was going to apply the policy to one it had to be applied to all.<p>When Usagi turned to walk out of the crater their arrival created, she was greeted by a piece of paper in her face. She looked beyond the paper and saw that it was being held by Nabiki. "What is this?"<p>"It's a bill for the damages to our property," Nabiki replied mater- of-factly.<p>"But."<p>"Just take it. If you don't you could end up paying more than just damages," Ranma called out playfully.<p>Usagi took the bill and handed it to Ami who was better with numbers.  While Ami and Nabiki were discussing the finer points of Senshi financing Haruka walked up to Hotaru. As she reached the Senshi of Saturn, Haruka nodded at Ranma, who was standing beside Hotaru, and hugged her daughter.<p>"Have fun?"<p>Hotaru eagerly nodded her head. "Uh huh, everyone was real nice with me and I played with Sasami. Oh! You've got to see the martial arts moves Ranma can do. He's amazing."<p>Haruka smiled at her daughter's exuberance. She had hoped Hotaru would have fun. "Maybe he'll show me later."<p>Hotaru grabbed Haruka's hand, "Come on. You've got to see his neat door Washu made." Apparently Washu made a door to connect the Masaki and Tendo homes together so that Ranma's family could visit whenever they desire.<p>*********<p>As Ranma stood on the Tendo's verandah and watched Nabiki argue with the Senshi, he was joined by Cologne. "Hello Old Ghoul."<p>"Good morning Son-in-law," Cologne replied with a smile. "So what are your plans for the day?"<p>"I want to see what these girls are capable of, then I was hoping you and I could get some training time in. Where's Shampoo?"<p>"I too desire to see what these Senshi are capable of. As for Shampoo, she will be along shortly. I was more eager than she was. After all it is not every day that I get to see the genesis of a new tribe." For the first time in a while Cologne was really happy. She has always enjoyed the adversarial relationship she had with Ranma. It gave her something to look forward to. And she would be first to admit that when she first arrived she had thought of Ranma as an inferior male. But as time passed, Cologne began to realize something about the remarkable young man, unlike many at the tribe Ranma was her equal. He might not posses her knowledge or experience but what he did have more than made up for that, he had skills and a quick wit.<p>As Ranma stood there, his arm darted out and caught a blur. That blur showed itself to be Happosai. Said pervert lunged at the Senshi, when that didn't work he tried running, but all that got him was Cologne and Ranma laughing at him for the way his legs pumped while he was being suspended several feet in the air. Finally he gave up and turned to his captor, "Ah Ranma, won't you let an old man have one final thrill?"<p>"Nope. These people are our allies and you aren't going to be copping any feels until they are good and used to us. Think of it this way, if you take their underwear now, then they will blast you and you and your "pretties" will end up cooked."<p>Happosai took on a look of intense thought, "Why your right! Thank you Ranma for showing me your wisdom. Will you put me down now?"<p>"Sure and remember to stick around because we'll be leaving soon," said Ranma as he sat the aged martial artist back on the ground.<p>As soon as Happosai hit the ground he went to prepare himself for what is to come. In other words, he headed upstairs to play in Akane's underwear drawer.<p>While Happosai zipped off, Ranma turned to Cologne only to see the disbelieving expression that adorned her face. "What?"<p>"You're giving Happosai advice on when he can steal underwear," she asked incredulously.<p>Ranma shrugged his shoulders, "You know he's going to do it eventually. At least now we can give them a proper warning."<p>Cologne sighed, "I suppose you are right." She turned to go inside, "I'll make sure Happi stays out of trouble."<p>Ranma watched her bounce off with a smile and a shake of his head. Cologne might deny it but he could tell she still felt something for the perv. Ranma being the expert on such things.<p>When Ranma turned back he came face to face with Sailor Moon.<p>"Where's Sailor Pluto?"<p>"Yosho is watching her and keeping her away from me."<p>"Ok, so when do we leave," asked Usagi.<p>"Well," before he got further Shampoo jumped over the compound wall. "We can go whenever you're ready."<p>"Great! Let's go." Usagi wanted to get away from Nabiki and her bills as quickly as possible. How was she supposed to pay that bill when she has to beg her friends for ice cream money.<p>*********<p>When Ranma and those following him reached the area of the compound where the new door was at, they were treated to a spectacle. Nodoka was badgering Washu while Uranus and Saturn watched.<p>"Are you sure that this will let me see Ranma whenever I want?" This was not a product of stupidity on Nodoka's part. Rather, the incessant repeating of that question in a multitude of ways was born from Nodoka's disbelief.<p>"Yes, it will Mrs. Saotome. All you have to do is walk through the door." Washu was really getting annoyed with the constant questions. She could understand that Nodoka was happy to be able to see her son at her leisure, but it was getting ridiculous.<p>"Mom, you really should believe her. After all she was the one that brought me back to life."<p>When he began to talk to her, Nodoka turned to Ranma. When she heard that Washu was the one to fix her little boy her eyes grew large and they glistened in the morning sun. Her head turned oh so slowly to look at Washu. "Is this true?"<p>Having some experience with dealing with Misaki, Washu knew she was now in a dangerous situation. So she carefully said, "Yes?"<p>As both Ranma and Washu both predicted, Nodoka's face lit up in a huge smile. She then preceded to gather Washu in a mighty bear hug.<p>Washu, who was now being manhandled by Ranma's mother, glared hatefully at Ranma as he escorted his group through the door. "Oh I'll get you for this Ranma," she thought. While a part of her was angry at Ranma, another part was proud. Ever since she had met him, Washu had been working to loosen Ranma up a little. That he did this in front of strangers meant that her work had not been in vain.<p>As the last person walked through the door, Ranma turned to Washu and grinned evilly as he waved at the scientist/goddess. "Bye Washu, catch up when you can."<p>As Ranma closed the door he heard Washu yell, "I get you for this." That was something he looked forward to. Since he started living at the Masaki home Washu had been constantly on the assault. She would spray him with water when his curse was still water activated. But water wasn't her only weapon. One day she put something in his food that turned his hair white for a day. Normally all this would have bothered Ranma but he could tell they were all in the nature of good humor. He was also waiting for the right moment. That one perfect time to level a mondo whammy on her. That bit with his mother is what he was looking for.<p>*********<p>Once everyone was on the other side of he door and away from the prying eyes of the Nerima populace Ranma addresses the Senshi. "Ok, rule number one. No secrets. If you want to guard me that's fine, but I want to know who you all really are."<p>"But what about them," asked Sailor Mars as she pointed to Cologne, Shampoo, and Happosai. Rei was upset, in the time she had been a Senshi she had done a reasonable job at concealing her identity. Sure, the occasional person figured out who she was but since they were usually bad guys and they died it wasn't much of a problem. But to reveal herself to total strangers when even her grandpa didn't know, it just wasn't kosher.<p>"You don't have to worry about them. They can keep a secret. Can't they?" This was directed to Happosai.<p>"You can count on me."<p>"Well that's enough for me," said Usagi as she returned to her regular form.<p>"But!"<p>"But nothing. Ranma is right, how are they supposed to trust us to protect him if we don't trust him with who we really are."<p>Everyone agreed with what Usagi said, some more reluctantly than others, and detransformed. After they did so, each introduced themselves.<p>"Great! Now that we're all introduced follow me. There is something we need to do." Ranma turned and headed towards a set of stairs. Those who were part of the Nerima group followed him closely. The Senshi were left standing next to the house as they watched as Ranma walked off. They stood there for several seconds as they blinked in confusion and then ran to catch up with him.<p>*********<p>In a clearing away from the Masaki shrine was Ryoko, Ayeka, Tenchi, and Mihoshi. The love birds were sitting on a small boulder that someone had placed in the spot to act as a bench for anyone who might need it. Though they weren't making out, Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko were practically one person.<p>Ryoko looked over at Mihoshi and saw that the blonde-haired detective was feeling out of place. So she decided to loosen her up some, Ryoko style. "So Mihoshi, how are you and Ranma doing?"<p>Mihoshi turned to face Ryoko and smiled at being able to talk about one of her favorite subjects, Ranma. One of her other favorite subjects was television, but that's beside the point. "We're great! I can't speak for Ranma, but this is the happiest I've been in a long time."<p>Ryoko grinned evilly, this was the perfect opportunity to ask the real question that she had wanted to ask. "Sooo, you two done it yet?"<p>"Ryoko! That's not something you ask someone," chastised Ayeka. Though it was a question that highly interested Ayeka. Those two, Ranma and Mihoshi, were always so close to one another. With all the training they do together, they move with such fluidity and grace while together that it borders on precognition. While the question intrigued her it was simply not the kind of question one asks in mixed company. As far as she was concerned, the only sex life Tenchi should have any knowledge of was his own.<p>"Oh come on Ayeka. They've been together for a while now and taken god knows how many baths together. They must have done it at least once." Ryoko turned to a now deeply blushing Mihoshi, "Well?"<p>With her head down to hide her blush, Mihoshi gently said, "No." And this wasn't because she didn't want to. In fact there hasn't been a moment during the last week when she didn't wish to do what Ayeka did. But one thing held her back, Ranma's past. He had told her everything his ex- fiancés had done in their quest to get in the sack with Ranma and she didn't want to be associated with them. So she took a policy of getting to know each other and waiting until Ranma was ready. As far as she could tell she was the first woman he had ever thought of in such a serious manner. She knew that as a reward for waiting, when they did finally do the deed it would be with someone that both were 100% sure of.<p>While Ayeka was curious to why Ranma and Mihoshi had yet to consummate an obviously intense love for each other, she was unwilling to infringe on their personal life. In order to spare Mihoshi, and by extension Ranma, any further embarrassment, Ayeka changed the subject. "Why are we sitting here?" It was a question that she already knew the answer to but she hoped it would direct Ryoko onto another train of thought.<p>Mihoshi was the first to reply with, "Ranma wants you three to fight the Senshi so he can see how good they are."<p>"Well that explains us. But why are you here," asked Ryoko in her usual blunt manner.<p>"Well Ranma asked me to watch so that he could get as many opinions as possible." Ranma had asked last night while in bed. Apparently Washu had done some research on them using the planet's information network and found out some things about them.<p>At that, the clearing went silent once again. It stayed like that for several minutes but before Ryoko could bring up another uncomfortable topic Ranma walked up. He was followed by some of the oddballs from Nerima and a group of schoolgirls. Being able to put two and two together and get four, they realized that these must be what the Senshi look like when they aren't dressed up as superheros.<p>As soon as Ranma entered the clearing he made a b-line to Mihoshi. Said girlfriend was making her way to Ranma at the same time and they met in the middle of the clearing. Once they reached each other they embraced and kissed as if neither had seen the other in a long time.<p>Cologne and Happosai both were shocked that Ranma would display such emotions as if it was second nature.<p>While the masters stood in shock Shampoo felt a pang of despair. It should be her in Ranma's arms like that. The only thing that softened the blow was the fact that this Mihoshi was very beautiful and very open in her feelings for Ranma. It is only proper that Ranma was with someone as beautiful and loving as she was.<p>As the Senshi saw the display the collective thought of the younger members was, "Awww." That kind of love was what each fought to preserve and what each longed for.<p>The older Senshi's thoughts were entirely different from their counterparts. Haruka watched them with mild disgust. It was just not right. A woman with legs and a butt like Mihoshi's shouldn't be straight.<p>Michiru was annoyed, not at the couple who were showing their love for each other but at her own significant other. Haruka was allowed to look, she had admired how the tank top Mihoshi wore gave an excellent view of her breasts. But that was all Michiru wanted, a look. For all she really wanted or needed was the wonderful blonde next to her. While she had looked Haruka was leering, and that was unacceptable. As punishment she gave Haruka a sharp elbow to the ribs. This accomplished two goals: one, it got Haruka to stop leering, and two, Haruka started paying attention to her.<p>After a brief and chaste kiss, Ranma and Mihoshi separated and turned to the group. "Ok, I would like you guys to introduce yourselves to the people who are going to test you."<p>After the Senshi introduced themselves, Minako asked, "What do you mean by 'test us'?"<p>"Well, I can protect myself from almost everything, so I'd like to know what you can do. So to answer that question, each of you will fight either Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, and if she doesn't mind, Shampoo. After the individual fights you will all go against me." Ranma then turned to address the ones who would fight the Senshi. "When you guys fight I want you to remember that this is friendly combat. So you can't kill them." He knew that they wouldn't do that, but if he didn't say it and something bad happened, they could say that they didn't know. He turned to Shampoo, "If somebody beats you, you can't give them the kiss of death."<p>"Yes Ranma," since Ranma was now an elder she had to obey that edict.<p>The Senshi were aghast at hearing the comments on kisses of death and killing blows. In their experience, when people say die or death in conjunction with fighting them someone usually dies. So this begged the question, what kind of people were they going to be fighting?<p>*********<p>Back at the Masaki home, the door that Washu had installed to allow people to be with Ranma was flung open. Out of the door dove Washu, who upon reaching the Masaki side of the door, immediately slammed said door closed and braced herself against it. Her ample chest heaved as her lungs tried desperately to take in enough oxygen to keep up with her heart. As she was plastered to the door she waited for any sign that someone was trying to follow her. Once she was sure that her attacker would remain were she was, Washu removed herself from the door and a wave of energy passed over her form. As the wave traveled down her form, Washu's hair was put back into its proper place and a cleaner, straighter copy of the academy outfit that she was wearing today replaced her clothes. Once she was presentable again she sought out the location of Ranma's "testing". When she found them she teleported to their location but right before she did, she turned back to the door and with a final shake of her head she said, "That woman is as bad as Misaki."<p>*********<p>The players were all set, on one side of the clearing stood the Sailor Senshi in their transformed states, and on the other were Shampoo, Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi. On the sidelines stood Ranma, Mihoshi, Cologne, Happosai, and Washu each prepared to watch the up coming battles.<p>********* ROUND ONE: Shampoo VS. Mercury<p>With their teams out of the line of fire Shampoo and Mercury stood across from each other on the field of battle.<p>As Sailor Mercury looked at her opponent, several things went through her mind. How was Shampoo capable of making those weapons to appear. She also went through the various attacks she knew.<p>As Shampoo looked at her opponent, she had to consider her opponent's competency as a warrior. The outfit she wore had a multiple places where an opponent could grab and throw her off balance. This was why she wore the dresses that she did since they have nothing to grab hold of and the tightness detracted most males. Her opponent did not have the look of a great warrior, as a matter of fact she looked like a scholar.<p>At a signal from Ranma both combatants engaged each other. Shampoo ran forward with each of her weapons at the ready. Her forward motion was quickly halted by Mercury's attack.<p>With a cry of, "Shabon Spray," Sailor Mercury enveloped the area around Shampoo in a dense fog. She stood there wondering what her next attack should be. This was hard because the attacks consisted of two types, distraction and kill. Unfortunately her thoughts were cut short as Shampoo came flying out of her mist with her bomboris poised for the kill.<p>Inside the fog that Sailor Mercury created Shampoo couldn't see a thing. The cold wetness surrounded her and dampened her senses. Luckily the air had been dry enough that the attack hadn't activated her curse. As she looked around, Shampoo couldn't find her opponent so she tried the one method of detection left to her, Ki sense. She was nowhere near the level of Ranma or her great-grandmother, but she was able to detect a presence in front of her. Since this person had the same warble to their aura that the Senshi have it must be Sailor Mercury.<p>Those on the sidelines watched as Shampoo emerged from the dense fog and practically flew at Ami. Said girl did nothing to raise any form of defense and was promptly knocked unconscious for her efforts. As Ami fell to the ground the rest were treated to an Amazon victory dance.<p>The Senshi quickly rushed out to their fallen comrade. Once the reached her they were able to determine that the blow caused no noticeable damage other than the unconsciousness. This was quickly remedied by a small application of Saturn's power. Once they saw that Ami was fine they cleared the area for the next bout.<p>********* ROUND TWO: Ryoko VS. Venus<p>Ryoko and Sailor Venus stood across from one another on the field of battle.<p>Ryoko was standing as if she had nary a care in the world. She had watched Shampoo's battle and if Ami typified the abilities of the Senshi then the upcoming bout should prove to be boring. Her lack of interest in this battle was made evident by her choice of clothing, she was wearing the same outfit that she wore when she blew up Tenchi's school.<p>While Ryoko wasn't worrying about the fight, Minako most certainly was. She had seen how Ami's match had gone and her opponent was standing prepared. If there was something that she learned from her time as Sailor V it was that there were two types of fighters, the dangerous and the beaten. The beaten fighters were the ones like Shampoo who took stances and stayed mired in the formality of a particular style. The dangerous ones were like Ryoko. With this in mind she readied a low power Crescent Beam.<p>When Ranma gave the signal to begin Minako instantly shot off her attack. The orange beam of energy streaked towards the smirking Ryoko. The Senshi started to get worried as the beam got closer and closer yet she did nothing. When the attack hit her and exploded violently Minako was aghast. As the dust cloud formed by the explosion dissipated and Ryoko was nowhere to be found Minako dropped to her knees. "No. It can't be. It couldn't have killed her. It's just not possible."<p>The Senshi was stunned. Never had one of their own killed an innocent. And for something as stupid as training. This wasn't what they stood for, the Senshi were about love and justice yet one of their own just killed a person. What stunned them even more was the apparent lack of care on the part of Tenchi, Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, and Ranma.<p>Cologne and Shampoo were shocked as well. From what Ranma had told her this Ryoko was supposed to be a good fighter yet here she was apparently dead. Ranma's apathy disturbed Cologne but she hoped that his apparent lack of care was because of something that he knew.<p>This hope bore fruit and the Senshi's mourning was brought to a sudden halt by the sound of laughter coming from above them. The assembled group looked up to see that Ryoko was alive and well and laughing about thirty feet in the air. The Senshi were shocked at seeing Ryoko's less than dead state.<p>Once Ryoko stopped laughing and looked down at the still kneeling Minako and stared her in the eyes. "You call that an attack? Little Miss Princess over there can dish out more than that. If you want fire a laser then do it like THIS," she extended an arm at Minako and fired off an orange energy blast at the prone Senshi.<p>Minako was so shocked that Ryoko was both alive and floating that she didn't evade Ryoko's attack. While the attack wasn't that powerful and not aimed at Minako, the Senshi was blown back several feet as the ground before her exploded. When landed she was dazed for several seconds and when she opened her eyes they crossed as they tried to focus on the orange shaft of energy in front of her. She looked beyond the energy to see that Ryoko was smirking while one hand was outstretched and holding the energy as if it were a sword.<p>Ryoko looked down at her fallen opponent and when Minako register her presence she said, "Do you yield?" When Minako gave a subtle nod Ryoko released her sword and offered her hand to Minako.<p>Minako took hold of Ryoko's offered hand and used it to pull herself up. "Congratulations," she said as she shook Ryoko's hand. With that both combatants left the field of battle.<p>On both sides of the field the resident scientists for the groups were hard at work one their computers. Washu's hands flew over her astral computer as she went through the data her various sensors were collecting. She had heard of the Serenitys and their Silver Millennium, but had always been doubtful of their abilities due to the use of one word, Magic. Some say that what the Juraians do is magic but it is merely an application of their own power as given to them by Tsunami. The people of the Moon Kingdom had never left their tiny solar system so Washu never bothered researching them. Now though that decision seems to have been premature. Her scans of the Senshi and what they can do while in battle were very interesting. Though they have a good deal of power backing them it is nowhere near the level that Ryoko or herself could put out. Their attacks seem rather lengthy to produce which is a definite negative. What really interested her was the so-called armor they wear. Despite their flimsy nature and the fact that there is nothing covering the legs it seems to give full body protection. When Ami was hit by Shampoo's weapon and when Minako was flung back by the explosion there was an increase in the Senshi's energy that seems to lower both kinetic and potential energy. The one drawback to the armor was sharp objects, from the looks of Venus the amour didn't fully protect from the debris picked up in the explosion.<p>On the other side of the field the Senshi's counterpart to Washu was busy working on the data her Mercury computer collected. From her battle with Shampoo she was able to determine that the energy that her busty opponent had used was the same as what the Negaverse had been stealing from people. The only difference between Shampoo and those victims appeared to be the amount of energy. Shampoo had several times the amount of bio- energy that a normal person should have. As for the fight between Ryoko and Minako her computer was having difficulties with the data. The energy patterns of Ryoko were totally unknown to it and the power of it was also giving the tiny computer difficulties.<p>********* ROUND THREE: Ayeka VS. Moon<p>As Ayeka looked across the field of battle at the opponent she was cautious. She figured that the Senshi were using watered down techniques yet at the same time each fighter was getting stronger. Many would think that the girl in font of her was going to be easy but Ayeka knew better. The look in Usagi's eyes and the manner in which she carried herself reminded Ayeka of Mihoshi before Ranma. If there was one thing that Mihoshi was good for it was doing the unexpected. Since Usagi reminded her of Mihoshi, Ayeka brought her shield to bear and put as much power into it as she could, though she didn't activate her own armor.<p>Usagi was scared. She had seen the power that the others had displayed and she wasn't sure if she could win. Sure she had attacks that could do tremendous damage. To evil. She had never tried her attacks against those that were either not possessed or filled with evil. Since Ayeka was neither, her attack's effectiveness was doubtful. As Ayeka brought up her shield Usagi was shocked to see the logs appear out of thin air and her chances for victory were looking smaller by the minute.<p>When Ranma gave the signal to begin Ayeka gestured to Usagi to tell her to go first. She had fought Ryoko for so long she wanted to test the power of her shield against a different opponent.<p>Seeing that Ayeka was letting her go first and not willing to look a gift horse in the mouth Usagi readied her attack. She pulled out her wand and twirled around impressively when she was finished she yelled her attack, "Moon Spiral Heat Attack!" When she finished a giant pink heart flew from her wand at Ayeka at a fantastic speed. Despite the heart's size, it wasn't as powerful as the attack was normally. It seems as if when she gets a new attack her old attacks become more manageable and thus allowing her to change the intensity of said attack.<p>From behind her shield Ayeka watched the attack in the form of a giant pink heart streak towards her. Needless to say, she was stunned. Ayeka had seen a great many things in this universe, but an attack that produces a giant pink heart wasn't one of them. She was so shocked that she did nothing to get out of the way, so the heart slammed into her shield with a great explosion.<p>From the sidelines Tenchi and Ryoko were slightly worried. Ayeka was nowhere near as powerful as they were so when the large pink heart slammed into Ayeka's shield they didn't know what the outcome would be. This worry quickly disappeared as Ayeka erupted from the dust cloud in full battle armor. She streaked toward the stunned Senshi of the Moon at an unbelievable speed.<p>As Ayeka flew at Usagi she mentally cursed herself. She shouldn't have been as careless as she had been but now she would make up for that mistake. She had donned her armor just in case the girl before her might pull off another attack.<p>As Usagi saw Ayeka fly out of the dust cloud at high speed she despaired. She had wanted this to be a good representation of what she could do yet here she was about to be hit in the face. Deciding to do something and show once again that she should be Sailor Moon. So she jumped. With their magical enhancements a Senshi can jump quite high but what Usagi did on this day was more than a simple jump, she flew. At that moment, Usagi didn't think about the fact that she hadn't fallen, all that mattered was Ayeka passing underneath her. Acting on instinct Usagi reached up to her forehead and plucked the tiara from its spot there. Usagi hurled the now glowing disk at Ayeka, whom it hit in the back of the head with a loud bonk. After the attack hit Ayeka she slammed into the ground at high speed since she hadn't slowed down yet. Fearing for Ayeka's safety Usagi flew down to check on her health but before she could get there Ryoko made it to her first. As Ryoko checked on Ayeka, Usagi floated there several inches above the ground and wrung her scepter nervously.<p>Tenchi reached Ayeka a second after Ryoko did. By the time he got there Ryoko had already turned Ayeka over and was checking for any injuries. Luckily the only damage seemed to be from Usagi's attack, her armor took care of the rest. But the attack did leave Ayeka disoriented. This was made evident by the glassy look to her eyes and what she said, "Is that you Mihoshi? When did you learn how to fly?" Tenchi shook his head and placed a hand on his beloved's forehead. There was one thing that Tenchi really loved about his Light Hawk powers and that was the side benefits, in particular the ability to heal. With a simple application of his power Tenchi was able to heal all of Ayeka's injuries.<p>By the time that Tenchi was healing Ayeka's minor injuries the rest of the Senshi ran up. While they were somewhat concerned for Ayeka's condition the main reason for their shock was the fact that their leader was floating several inches off the ground.<p>"Usagi," said Rei, "you're flying."<p>"What! Come on Rei if I was flying then why am I standing on the ground." Upon the completion of that statement Usagi looked down to prove to herself that Rei was wrong. When she saw that she was indeed floating above the ground. "Yikes!" With that the spell was broken and she fell to the ground. She sat on the ground for several seconds with her head down. Now that she was thinking about it she could feel a mild tingling sensation emanating from her back. The funny thing about the abilities of the Sailor Senshi was that once they used them once they could use them again. Now that she had seen how it was done Usagi could fly. She raised her head and looked at the group and with a wide grin said in an awed whisper, "I can fly." At that Usagi rocketed into the sky all the while she was giggling like a maniac. Though she could use her newfound flying ability Usagi wasn't as proficient as she would have liked and she ended up crashing through the forest. When she finally landed Usagi had twig and leaves stuck in her hair and several small cuts and scratches on her exposed skin.  Despite this, a huge grin split the young girl's face. Since she was still on her flying high she had to be dragged from the field in order to have the next match. This was made easier by the simple fact that Usagi was once again floating several inches above the Earth.<p>********* ROUND FOUR: Tenchi VS. Mars<p>As Tenchi stood across from Rei, he felt very confident indeed. He had spent the last few months sparring with Ranma and with his ability to use The Light Hawk Wings he felt confident that he could handle anything the woman before him could dish out. That being said he held the Tenchi- ken in his right hand so that the playing field would be somewhat even. As Tenchi held the weapon he reflected that it was no longer his. When he had received his own tree the Tenchi-ken refused to work for him since he was now bonded to another tree. Knowing that Tenchi would still need the use of the weapon for training and other things Yosho allowed him to use the sword until such time as his tree would be able to create its own key. A time that Washu assured would be coming soon.<p>Rei looked at Tenchi warily. Each of the others that had fought a Senshi varied in skills. The one constant that seems to apply to them all is that each is blindingly fast. As she went through her attacks she realized that all but one has a fatal flaw, the target has to be stationary and directly in front of her. The only attack that this flaw was somewhat mitigated was her Burning Mandalas. Since she now had more control over the attack she could guide small groups of the burning rings independently of the rest. She hoped that this would allow her to offset any maneuverability on Tenchi's part. So like Venus before her Rei was preparing to fire the attack as soon as Ranma gave the word to start the match.<p>On the sidelines Ranma and the others looked at the two combatants. Tenchi was standing nonchalantly waiting for the whole mess to be over with while Rei's whole body was tensed and ready for battle. When he gave the signal Rei yelled out, "Burning Mandala!" From out of nowhere appeared flaming rings, which then flew at Tenchi. Tenchi remained standing as he was for several seconds and then he slipped into a stance that reminded Mihoshi and Ayeka of the one Yosho took when he fought Kagato. Sure enough like that time so long ago a transparent shield of energy appeared to block the main group of rings and then slid along an imaginary sphere to intercept the rings coming in from other angles. Once all the rings were destroyed Tenchi disappeared only to reappear with the blade of a blue energy sword in much the same location as when this happened to Minako.<p>When her attack failed to do what she intended Rei was shocked. So shocked was she that she missed the fact that Tenchi disappeared. But while she might have missed that what she didn't miss was the blue blade of energy. While she conceded the victory to Tenchi she had a mask of indifference firmly in place but internally her mind was reeling. That wasn't a teleport that Tenchi performed, she had felt the air from his sudden stop blow her hair back somewhat. So the only conclusion was that it was pure speed. She knew that these people were powerful aliens, but this was not what she expected. Now that she had fought Tenchi she thought back to her vision and what she found scared her even more. If someone of Tenchi's power was defeated by Tokimi, how were they supposed to beat her.<p>********* ROUND FIVE: Shampoo VS. Jupiter<p>Standing across from Sailor Jupiter, Shampoo was unafraid. She had beaten her first opponent and had seen how easily the other Senshi were beaten so she was feeling rather sure of herself.<p>Makoto stood across from Shampoo, ready and willing for battle. She had seen the previous battles and they invigorated her. Not the pain but the skill and power that was displayed. The skill of the woman in front of her impressed her the most, since Shampoo was human everything she could do Makoto could do as well, given enough time.<p>When Ranma gave the signal to attack Shampoo began to step menacingly towards Makoto, confident in the knowledge that she would be victorious. Makoto used this arrogance on Shampoo's part against her and was able to launch her attack. With a cry of, "Sparkling Wide Pressure," Makoto hurled a ball of electricity at the amazon.<p>Seeing the attack fly at her Shampoo was unafraid. Her rudimentary senses were enough to tell her that the attack would hit with the force of a light punch and had the attack been comprised of chi she would have been correct. But alas, the attack was magical in nature and had very little chi in its make-up. What it had in abundance was electricity, so when Shampoo raised her arms, and weapons, up to block she merely placed them closer to the attack. When Makoto's attack hit Shampoo didn't have enough time to ponder the differences between the punch and the attack since her body and mind surged with electricity. As the electricity coursed through her body all of her voluntary muscles locked up and her face was contorted in a silent scream.<p>When the energy finished arching across her granddaughter's frame, Cologne hurried over to the downed girl. What she saw was comical to say the least, despite laying on the ground Shampoo's arms and legs were still in the same position as they were before she fell. Her long purple hair, Shampoo's pride and joy, stood out from her head in every direction and several of the ends had smoke wisping off them. Seeing that she was fine Cologne shook her head. Shampoo had gotten arrogant and this was the result. When medical aide was offered she waved it off since Shampoo was well enough to live. "The pain will hopefully teach her not to underestimate her opponent." So instead of the peaceful way Shampoo would have woken with being healed, she was woken up by having a wooden cane smack her in the forehead. As Shampoo and Cologne walked back to their side of the field the elder berated her relative.<p>For her part Makoto was ecstatic. She had beaten one of those powerhouses. Admittedly she did beat the weakest one but a victory was a victory. The only regret she held towards the fight was that she wasn't able to test her skill as a fighter against Shampoo.<p>********* ROUND SIX: Tenchi VS. Uranus<p>For this battle Tenchi was even more wary than the first one. He outranked his opponent so badly that he felt it wasn't right to subject her to battle. But he also knew the importance of what they were doing, these battles were not so much a test of their abilities as a test of the Senshi's. Still, the whole affair felt wrong.<p>On her side of the field Haruka was raring to go. The way she figured it, if Usagi and Makoto can win while using less powerful attacks she should definitely be able to win. And unlike many of the battles that the Senshi of Uranus participated in, she had a plan. She would fire off a World Shaking and then, as Tenchi is distracted by the attack hitting his shield, she would come in with her Space Sword. This, she felt, would be the key to victory.<p>When Haruka heard the signal to begin she started her assault. She hurled a World Shaking at Tenchi and pulled her Space Sword from wherever it resides. Unfortunately for Haruka, those were the only parts of her plan to work. Instead of letting the attack hit his shield, Tenchi rushed forward and with a swipe of his blade cut the round ball of energy in half.  The energy continued on and exploded on either side of Tenchi's path but he was far from finished with his attack. Maintaining his speed Tenchi ran at Haruka and it was only by virtue of her ingrained sword fighting skill that she was able to block Tenchi's next attack. Their swords clashed with one another for several seconds until Tenchi decided to finish the bout. With the same speed he displayed in his battle with Rei Tenchi knocked the sword from Haruka's hands and once again the blue blade of the Tenchi-ken was centimeters away from a Senshi's face.<p>Once she conceded the win to Tenchi, Haruka walked over to where her sword ended up. When she got to the sword Haruka saw that it was buried to the hilt in a tree. With a mighty pull Haruka was able to dislodge the sword and with it a portion of the tree. Holding the sword at eye level Haruka was able to see the large hunk of dead wood that was attached to the blade. Taking her sword in both hands Haruka bashed the wood against the tree. This resulted in a shower of wood splinters to cover Haruka. When she turned to face her fellow Senshi Haruka could see that each and every one of them were trying their damnedest not to laugh. She gave those who would dare laugh at her plight a fearsome glare and then with every ounce of dignity a woman covered in woodchips can summon, Haruka walked to join her comrades. When she reached her family Hotaru helped her Papa remove the errant wood from her body.<p>********* ROUND SEVEN: Ayeka VS. Neptune<p>For this battle Ayeka was in her battle armor once more. It was not because she was worried about the battle but because she didn't want to mess up her outfit for a small fight.<p>While Ayeka wasn't concerned about the fight, Michiru was. Looking at Ayeka she saw a very powerful woman ready to kick her ass. Unlike Haruka, Michiru held no false hopes for victory. The only reason Usagi had been able to win against Ayeka was because she learned a new ability at the last moment. Michiru doubted the same would happen for her. Instead of trying to win, Michiru's philosophy going into this battle was to make a good showing and not seriously embarrass herself.<p>When the signal was given Ayeka waited for Michiru to attack. After all this was a test of THEIR abilities and not her's. Seeing that her opponent was waiting for her Michiru launched her assault and hurled a Deep Submerge at her foe. As the attack grew closer Ayeka boosted the energy to her shield to maximum and braced for impact. When Neptune's attack struck Ayeka's shield every bit of the magic containing the water disappeared. Unfortunately the water didn't. So, in a very comic move Ayeka was drenched in water.<p>For several seconds Ayeka stood motionless as water dripped from her hair. "How dare she," Ayeka thought. "How dare she soak the First Crown Princess of Planet Jurai. I shall have my revenge!" With that thought firmly in place Ayeka raised off the ground and raised her head to give Michiru her worse glare. Once Michiru was suitably spooked, Ayeka flew towards the motionless woman at full speed.<p>Those who knew Ayeka were in various levels of laughter. To them it was hilarious, usually these types of things happen to Ranma, for it happen to Ayeka, insanely funny. But their laughter died a quick and cold death upon seeing the glare that Ayeka gave Michiru. With one simple look Ayeka proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that she was Misaki's daughter. The glares were identical.<p>When her attack resulted in a very wet princess, Neptune knew she was in trouble. As Ayeka began to float and then glared at her she began to look for an avenue of escape while only moving her eyes. Somewhere in the more primal recesses of her brain a command activated. It was a simple command that told her body to remain absolutely still, that way Ayeka wouldn't see her. Of course this didn't work because Ayeka began to fly at her at high speed. By this point all Michiru could do was brace herself against the coming pain. But no pain came as Ayeka stopped her flight just before hitting her.<p>But Ayeka had never intended to hurt Michiru only show her the error of her ways. The wall of compressed air her speedy flight created was more than enough to accomplish this. Before Michiru could form any real thought said wall of air slammed into her and threw her several feet back. With her justice being distributed as she had willed, Ayeka returned to her normal outfit and turned to face her loved ones. What she saw irked her somewhat, Washu, Ranma, Mihoshi, Ryoko, and Tenchi were all huddled together as far away from her as possible.<p>Seeing the unhappy look on her beloved's face all the fear left Ryoko and she quickly made her way to Ayeka. Upon reaching her Ryoko enveloped the irate princess in a large bear hug in an attempt to show Ayeka that despite how scary she may be she was still loved. The loving couple was shortly joined by Tenchi then they preceded to have a group hug and shower one another with love.<p>Seeing that the danger from Ayeka had passed Ranma and Mihoshi stood up. Looking at the embracing trio Ranma realized that he hadn't hugged Mihoshi in a while and moved to rectify that problem. He wrapped his arms around Mihoshi's lithe frame and pressed her close to himself. In Ranma's arms Mihoshi was experiencing pure bliss. But in a corner of her mind the kernel of doubt that Ryoko had planted began to bear fruit. "Why doesn't he want me," she asked herself. It was her experience that men wanted sex as soon as possible, if they hadn't wanted to wait for her parents approval than Ayeka, Tenchi, and Ryoko would have done it the first day they were together. She wasn't with Ranma for sex, what she wanted was joy, the joy that comes with two people coming together to form something greater. She had had that with Kiyone and it was more wonderful than anything that she could have imagined. It was that joy that she wanted to share with Ranma, if he let her.<p>After hugging his girlfriend for a good while Ranma withdrew from her but before he got too far he gave Mihoshi a parting kiss. Afterwards he walked towards the assembled Senshi, before he said a word he looked at each one of the girls. Behind the mask of an inscrutable master Ranma was amazed, these girls had done far better than he had ever imagined. "You guys did better than I expected. But you aren't done with your fighting for today. You've got one last fight, against me, and I want you to use your strongest attacks."<p>"WHAT!" Needless to say, the Senshi were shocked. No one has ever ASKED to be hit with the entire arsenal of the Sailor Senshi, which caused many of them to question the sanity of the people who they were trying to help.<p>"I want to see how powerful you really are. If you are more powerful than I expect then I am fast enough to be able to dodge your attack. So don't worry about me." With that Ranma walked to the other side of the small clearing.<p>The Sailor Senshi looked to their leader for guidance on this problem. If they were going to kill the guy they were supposed to protect then they were going to only do so at Usagi's behest. "Let's do as he wants. Hotaru, I don't want you to do this fight either. He might be powerful but I don't want to chance a Silence Glaive Surprise. Also, be ready to heal Ranma up if we end up injuring him, okay," Usagi said while smiling.<p>Hotaru nodded gratefully, "Okay!" She too had feared Ranma's ability to handle every one of the Senshi's most powerful attacks, including her own. During her stay at the Masaki home she had taken the time to get to know Ranma a little. What she learned both amazed her and made her depressed. She was amazed at the skill and power Ranma expressed in his art. He had taken her to what he called the "Training Room" and really cut loose. He had been all over the place while moving so fast that he left an after image in his wake. Then to top that he destroyed things with merely a swipe of his hand. He made her depressed for much the same reason as other men depressed her, she couldn't have him. But this time her not having him had nothing to do with her. Ranma had seen her healing ability and remarked on great it was that she could help others in such a fashion. Upon seeing how weak she was Ranma offered her training to boost her strength and stamina as opposed to others who would make fun of her. He was kind and gentle and she was very smitten, but alas he was already taken thus her depression. But there was a small silver lining that the dark recesses of her mind could use to create fanciful dreams, Tenchi was in a three way relationship. So, relieved that she wouldn't be the reason for making Ranma a molecular paste, Hotaru hurried over to where Tenchi and the others where at.<p>Standing across from Ranma the Senshi had varying thoughts and feelings. Some, like Usagi, were concerned that they would hurt Ranma. Others, like Makoto could see the way Ranma moved and only one thought traveled through their brains, "We are sooo screwed." But despite their misgivings the Senshi followed Ranma's wishes, so with much twirling and flashing colors each one of the Sailor Senshi, Champions of Love and Justice and Defenders of the Planet Earth, launched their most powerful attacks at one man. The seven attacks merged together to form a swilling kaleidoscope of colors and death whose energies were felt by people for miles.<p>As the attack streaked towards him Ranma was impressed at the power these girls could put out at a time. While he may be impressed on the inside he was still wearing that insufferable smirk that enraged so many opponents because a part of them knew he could win. Why, you ask, was he smirking while one if the most powerful attacks the Senshi had ever produced streaked towards him. The answer is quite simple, the Senshi, with all their power and abilities, use magic and Ranma remembered that during his story Nergal told him that he was able to cut through magical assaults with the Neko-Ken. So with the same effort that a cat would use, Ranma swiped his hand though the air before him. Like usual this produced four virtually transparent dark blue blades of energy. Ranma expected this attack to slice through the Senshi's attack and then hit the ground about a foot away from the Senshi and explode. That was why he was running behind his attack, he was going to use the explosion as cover for his real attack.  Unfortunately this didn't work like he expected and when his attack met the one produced by the Senshi they exploded violently. Since Ranma's attack was what caused the explosion 99 percent of it continued in the direction of the attack. This violently threw the Senshi into each other and the trees behind them. Ranma was also thrown backwards but since he didn't bear the brunt of the explosion he was able to control his flight and landed on all fours.<p>The Senshi were not so lucky, many knocked each other out as they hit another Senshi or they hit a Senshi and a tree. Being more used to extreme impacts than her fellow Senshi Makoto was able to stay conscious despite being hit by a tree and Rei. Though she was dazed Makoto quickly recovered and when she did, what she saw did not give her a confident feeling. Of her fellow Senshi, she was the only one who was conscious, the rest were knocked out and some were moaning in their unconscious state. She then looked to the cloud of smoke and debris that the explosion had created and she knew that Ranma was on the other side. Since she didn't know what his condition was she had to assume that he was, like her, still conscious. So she decided to employ a tactic that the Senshi were not well known for, running away. Makoto quickly ran into the forest behind her hoping that the trees would hide her.<p>Ranma was playing this smart, instead of running head long into the dust cloud he waited until it had cleared so as to not let whoever was on the other side get the drop on him. When the cloud cleared he saw that all the Senshi were in various states of unconsciousness, but as he began counting Senshi he saw that one was missing and that was Makoto. Realizing that she must have run into the forest he followed her so that he could hunt her down. Upon entering the wooded area he could tell in what direction his quarry lay. He could smell her. So he followed his nose to find the hiding Senshi. When he found her she was hiding behind some scrub bushes and she was facing away from him. As he watched her she turned her head one way and then another and then she slowly turned to face him. Seeing him her eyes grew large and Ranma heard her say two words, "Oh crap." Ranma simply nodded his head and then punched at her only to stop a millimeter from her nose and she passed out from shock.<p>*********<p>When the Senshi woke up a most delicious smell was on the air. The smell was soo good that all of the unconscious Senshi woke up salivating. They quickly looked around and saw that they were on the dock outside the house where they first arrived. Several feet away from them on a blanket was everyone that was in the clearing earlier and others who were at the meeting the night before. The other person with them is what surprised them for Usagi was also sitting on the blanket and was happily partaking of the offered food. The Senshi looked at one another and nodded as one they were then right next to the group of people eating, each with their cutest and most pathetic faces on. "May we please have some food too," they asked at the same time.<p>Sasami looked at the Senshi's pathetic faces and smiled brightly, "Of course you can. Please have a seat and grab some food. There is more than enough for everyone."<p>The Senshi said their thanks and gleefully dug into the food prepared by the mothers and Sasami. Soon all the food was eaten and all the containers were placed back into the baskets on the edge of the blanket. Usagi looked to Ranma and asked, "So what now?"<p>"Well like I said, you did better than I expected and you Senshi are very powerful, but you take way too long to launch your attacks. Had she actually been trying to kill you, Shampoo would have done so before you could have fired a single shot and she is one of the slowest of us. So here is what I suggest. While you guys are here to protect me you can get training in my style, Anything Goes Martial Arts."<p>"And I can teach you some of our ways if you so desire," added Cologne. These Senshi with the right training, i.e. Amazon training, could be a very powerful ally for her new tribe. It just shocked her that warriors that were supposedly responsible for the saving of the world on multiple occasions could be so unskilled in the ways of battle.<p>*********<p>Tenchi Masaki and Ranma Saotome were facing the most harrowing adventure of the lives. What lay ahead required skill, cunning, and a quick wit. Unfortunately the opponent they were about to face was a master of her chosen field, a field that they were ill equipped to handle, but their quest was just and they would let nothing stand in their way.<p>Ranma looked to Tenchi, beads of sweat gleaming on his forehead, and asked, "You ready?"<p>Tenchi's forehead was in a similar state, a testament to their combined nervousness. But would either of them admit it, HELL NO. Instead, Tenchi nodded his head solemnly to answer Ranma's question<p>With their course set Ranma reached out and knocked on the door before him right under the Nabiki nameplate. The sound of Ranma's hand striking the door ran loudly though out the quiet hall and both men waited in silent anticipation for the room's occupant to open the door. They didn't have to wait long.<p>When Nabiki opened the door she had been rather cross and was about to make whoever dared disturb her dream about her, Ranma, and a tub of Cool Whip pay dearly. But her ire was quickly dampened when she saw that the object of her previous dream was now standing outside her room. She smiled broadly thinking that this was just another dream but that smile dwindled just a bit when she saw that Tenchi was standing next to Ranma. "Hello Ranma, Tenchi what do you boys want with little ol' me?"<p>Ranma smiled at Nabiki, "Hey Nabiki, can we talk?"<p>Nabiki crossed her arms, "I don't know Ranma, CAN you talk?" She then stepped back to let the two into her room.<p>"Well we can but will you let us?"<p>"You're in my room aren't you? So what can I do for you?"<p>"I was hoping that you could tell us where we could find a shop that sells engagement rings," Ranma answered nervously.<p>Nabiki was stunned, for Ranma to want to buy an engagement ring was simply unbelievable. She was sure that Ranma had loved her sister and he had never tried to by a ring for her. This must mean he is really serious about Mihoshi. She walked over from the door and sat in her desk chair. "I know a few places that will fit your needs. But before I tell you I want you to tell me something, have you and Mihoshi done it yet?"<p>"WHAT? Why would you ask that?"<p>"Well, you are going to buy an engagement ring for her, I only think it is logical to ask whether or not you have had sex with her. I mean you were with Akane for a year and you never tried anything like this."<p>"Well, not that it is any of your business, but no we haven't. As for the ring, well I love her and I want to give her something to show her how much I love her even when I'm not there."<p>"Why?"<p>"What do you mean why? I told you I love her."<p>"That's not what I mean. Why haven't you two had sex yet? She has to be more attractive than all of your old fiancés and she seems to genuinely love you. So given all that why?"<p>This was a question that Tenchi wanted the answer to as well. It was inconceivable to him how two people in a relationship so deep it bordered on marriage could not have at least done it once. He could never contemplate not being with Ryoko and Ayeka in every way that he could.<p>"We're waiting for the right time and that is that. So are you going to tell us what we want or what," Ranma asked angrily. There was no way in hell he was going to tell these people why he and his love hadn't gone all the way.<p>Nabiki looked at Ranma for several seconds as if she were weighing her options. She knew that if she pushed Ranma any more he would leave and quite possibly never seek her council again. She could not let that happen. "Sorry Ranma. I was just curious." She then turned to her desk, pulled out a sheet of paper, and wrote several addresses on it. She then turned back Ranma and handed him the paper. "Here are some places with excellent rings. You should be able to find something for Mihoshi. Tell them Nabiki Tendo sent you and they'll give you some sort of discount."<p>Ranma looked at the sheet of paper for several seconds trying to commit the addresses to memory. Once they were sufficiently committed he looked up from the paper and said, "Thanks. How do you know about these places?"<p>Nabiki shrugged, "I've had some dealings with several of them. And," she said hesitantly. "Shortly before she was kidnapped by the Phoenix soldiers, Akane dragged me to several shops wondering which one you might get her. You do know that she really loved you, right?"<p>Ranma lowered his head, "I didn't when I left, but last night I realized how much she must have cared." He then looked at Nabiki, "Akane may have loved me, she might even love me now, but that doesn't matter. She had her chance and she got worse. Now I'm with Mihoshi and nothing in this universe is going to keep us apart." Ranma turned and headed towards Nabiki's door but he stopped with his hand on the handle, "Nabiki, thanks for the info. If you ever need help you know where to find me." With that he left the Tendo Dojo.<p>Tenchi watched Ranma leave the room and then turned to Nabiki, "Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it."<p>Nabiki waved him off, "No problem. I will always help out Ranma." She then turned pensive and looked to the spot Ranma just vacated. "Will you keep an eye on him? He's never been in a real relationship and he might get over his head. Someone needs to keep an eye on him and Mihoshi so that neither of them get hurt."<p>With an expression as solemn as Nabiki's, Tenchi nodded his head, "Of course I will. See you later," with that he too was gone.<p>"Good luck Ranma."<p>*********<p>When Tenchi left the Tendo compound he saw that Ranma was standing there waiting for him. Seeing that Ranma was in no mood to talk, Tenchi just followed his silent friend as they headed to the first location that Nabiki gave them.<p>Soon they spied a man dressed as an American police officer. The man's mirrored sunglasses and odd gait made Tenchi and Ranma fell rather uneasy. Their concern was only increased when the man stopped in front of them and took off his glasses.<p>"Excuse me. Have you seen this boy," as he asked that he held up a photo of an American male in his mid teens.<p>Both Ranma and Tenchi shook their heads unwilling to answer the odd man any other way.<p>Seeing that the boy had no information on his query the man placed his glasses back on his face and mechanically turned away.<p>Ranma and Tenchi looked at each other, "Let's go get those rings and get the hell out of here," suggested Ranma. To which Tenchi nodded his head in agreement and the two sped of to their destination.<p>*********<p>The room was cold. As one of Washu's newest upgrades to the house, Mihoshi's room, and every other room in the house, had its own AC unit. This way each room's occupant could have a temperature that fit their own needs. Mihoshi had her's set on strato freeze. "This way," she had reasoned to Ranma the first night he slept in her bed, "we can bundle up and be that much closer to each other." So, as she said on that night so long ago, Ranma and Mihoshi were on her bed and snug under the large comforter.<p>In a practice that they had started, Ranma and Mihoshi went to bed before they had to go to sleep. Unlike the other couples who were living in the house Ranma and Mihoshi didn't go to make love. They would strip until both were in their underwear and then they would climb under the covers until Ranma was laying on his back and Mihoshi had her head on Ranma's chest while their legs were intertwined. As they would lie there, Ranma would run his hands through Mihoshi's hair as they talked about their day or anything that was bothering them.<p>Today, Ranma and Mihoshi were talking about the day's battles and how they were going to improve the Senshi. During a lull in the conversation Mihoshi decided to confront Ranma on the problem that had plagued her the entire day. Ever since Ryoko asked her that question earlier in the day doubt had been eating at her, making her absolutely worthless in anything she tried to do. So in a move that scared Ranma, she asked him her question, "Ranma, do you find me attractive?"<p>When Mihoshi asked her question, the hand that Ranma was using to caress her hair stopped as if it were frozen in time. In his mind alarms were blazing and a robot was waving its arms saying, "Danger Ranma Saotome, danger." He knew from experience that this conversation had the potential for turning rather nasty. But despite the alarms he answered truthfully, "Of course I do. You're the most attractive woman I know."<p>Mihoshi sat up to look Ranma in the eyes and consequently gave him an up close view of her rather generous bust line. "Then why won't you try anything with me? When we make out you never try to cop a feel, and when we're in bed and my back is against your chest you keep your hands on my stomach. Is there something wrong with me?" The while time she spoke her voice was laden with the sorrow that her doubt had created.<p>As Mihoshi talked Ranma's attention was directed both on her pain filled eyes and how the cold effected her nipples. When she finished with her question Ranma went into a panic, he had never wanted Mihoshi to be hurt over this and was now afraid he may lose her over this. Ranma took Mihoshi's hands into his own, looked into his beloved's eyes, and with every ounce of love and truth he could summon Ranma answered her question, "Mihoshi, I want you to listen carefully. I love you, everything about you I love and there is nothing about you that I would change."<p>Mihoshi was on one hand relived that there was nothing wrong with her but on the other hand she was still concerned. But now her concern was not for herself but for Ranma. "Then why won't you share yourself with me?"<p>Ranma sighed, he knew that this conversation or one similar would come one day but he hoped that it wouldn't. Now his only recourse was to follow the American saying, "The truth shall set you free," his only hope was that in telling the truth Mihoshi wouldn't be the one going free.<p>"When I first came to Nerima I was instantly engaged to the most popular girl in school. Everyday the guys would ask how Akane was doing and give a wink and a nudge. Thinking they were concerned for Akane I would answer. I instantly became popular with the girls because of how I looked and they would pass me notes with VERY suggestive stuff on them. And then there was Akane, she could be kind to anyone she saw, but if I even thought about thinking to touch the top of her head with my pinkie finger I'd be hit and called a pervert. So one day I looked up what sex was and I was shocked. I couldn't believe people would ask about something like that or that Akane would think that I was doing that kind of thing. Then more fiancés showed up and each one wanted more than the one before.<p>But as weirded out about sex as I was, I knew that one day I might be married and my wife would want to do it. So I disguised myself as a woman and went around the district looking for groups of woman that I could listen in on. What I heard shocked me, most of the women got little or no pleasure at all from sex. Some of their partners wouldn't even wait until they were ready, to say nothing about actually having a good experience. I don't want to be in that kind of relationship. I want to be with you, I really do, its just that I'm scared that it won't be enjoyable for you and that you'll have to pretend that I'm doing a good job just to soothe my ego," he finished helplessly.<p>Mihoshi looked at Ranma with thinly veiled horror. She had known that his time in Nerima was bad, but to turn him away from sex? She decided to move quickly to reassure her man. In her opinion it wasn't right for Ranma to be afraid of something so integral to the relationship they were trying to create. "Ranma, I'm positive that when the time comes you will do fine." Ranma's look of questioning doubt only bolstered her will to help Ranma overcome his fear. Even if they didn't make love for another twenty years, at least he will feel confident and loved when the day finally came to take their love to the next level. "You have several advantages over those other guys. That you even thought about how a woman feels about sex means that you will try your hardest not to make the mistakes those other men made. I think the biggest advantage you have is your curse. You know better than any man what it is like to be a woman, physically that is. Have you tried to pleasure yourself as a woman?" She knew the answer to that question and she was ready to shoot down any denial. It was several days after they had gotten together and she was going to take a bath. When she got close to one of the smaller pools in the floating onsen Mihoshi heard a low lustful moaning. Upon some very secretive inspection Mihoshi was shocked to see the source of the moans was none other than Ranma. At that moment he was in his female form and the light streaming in through the onsen's glass like dome shined off the perspiration and water on his body. Along with the misty air and the sensuous moaning Mihoshi had little resistance and while Ranma never knew she was there, they both left VERY satisfied. Mihoshi mentally slapped her head and concentrated back on Ranma at the same time she did that her unconscious moved her legs slightly to relieve the wet sticky sensation she was currently experiencing.<p>Ranma blushed bright red at Mihoshi's question and was very greatly thankful that she wasn't laying on him because he had to readjust himself as well. Now if Ranma was psychic then he would be shocked to know that the time he was thinking about was the same time as Mihoshi. That had been the first time he had done anything like that in his other half, and while he has done on other occasions since, that first time was the most intense.  At times it had felt as if Mihoshi were really there. "Um yeah, I have," replied Ranma, his voice full of embarrassment.<p>"Well, did you enjoy yourself? Did it feel good?"<p>The only answer Mihoshi received was a nod from a very embarrassed Ranma.<p>"There you go. You know what to do when the time comes. If you can pleasure yourself you can pleasure me." Mihoshi waited for any sign that Ranma understood what she said. She didn't have to wait long.<p>Ranma sat up and wrapped his arms around Mihoshi in a warm embrace. "Thank you."<p>They stayed in each others arms for several minutes, just relishing the feel of warmth and love coming from the other. Finally Mihoshi pulled away and looked Ranma in the eye, "Do you feel better now?"<p>Ranma smiled, "Yes I do." Seeing the look in her eyes Ranma, headed off any question Mihoshi might ask, "But I'm not ready for everything that you want. It won't be long, you think you can wait?" To add more power to his question and because it was something he longed to do, Ranma slid his hands down her body until they came to rest on her rear. With hands firmly in place Ranma gently messaged the flesh underneath his palms.<p>Mihoshi tilted her head back slightly and luxuriated in the sensations Ranma was able to conjure up in her. She then looked at Ranma with a smoky gaze, "Oh, I don't know Ranma. The way you're going I might not be able to hold myself back if you keep on doing things like that." She then leaned forward and kissed Ranma on the lips. Their kiss lacked some of the passion of their other kisses but what lacked in passion it more than made up in love. This wasn't the raw untamed love of two people who have just gotten together, but the pure love of a couple who, with the wakening of each new day, discover yet another reason to love. Their kiss was brief and while their lips parted their foreheads remained pressed together.<p>They stared into the other's eyes soaking up their love and comfort until Ranma looked away, lest something happened that he was ill prepared for. Ranma got out of bed and quickly made his way over to his pants from which he retrieved a small box. He barely opened the box to confirm its contents and then made a b-line for the bed. Once again under the warmth of he covers, Ranma scooted as close as possible to Mihoshi and was surprised when the blonde-haired beauty sat herself in his lap. He quickly recovered and continued with his course of action. "Mihoshi, you know I love you right?"<p>"Of course I do, and I love you too."<p>"Well, we've talked about marriage before, and we've both said that we want to be together forever." Ranma put the box between them and continued, "That being said, will you marry me?"<p>When Ranma opened the box Mihoshi gasped at the beauty of the ring that it contained. The ring was a band of gold and silver woven together, and at the center there was a heart shaped gem the color of Mihoshi's eyes surrounded by silver and gold. Mihoshi began to weep for joy and she pressed Ranma to her in a hug and in the process crushing the ring between them. With her lips to Ranma's ear she whispered, "Yes." She released Ranma from her hug only long enough for him to place the ring on her finger and then she latched onto him once more.<p>Seeing that Mihoshi wasn't going to let go anytime soon, not that he minded, Ranma carefully lay back while Mihoshi was still attached to him. Once he was on his back, Mihoshi readjusted herself so that her whole body was pressed against his. So positioned, Ranma and Mihoshi both fell asleep and were visited by wondrous dreams of their life together.<p>*********<p>In Tokyo, a man was standing on a balcony. Mamoru Chiba was looking out over the city in silent thought. As he looked out and saw the lights of Tokyo, he asked himself, "How could I ever have thought about leaving this place?" And then he remembered, the visions. Snippets of memories or advice sent to him from the future through his dreams by a future self. Unlike Rei, his visions were harder to interpret, and on several occasions a wrong interpretation has led to pain. But now the visions had stopped, for the last several months he has received nothing and that worried him. A bigger concern was a feeling he has been having, normally it was like an itch he couldn't scratch but when he transformed it got much worse. Mamoru got the feeling that something big was going to happen, something that, while removed from Earth and its people, would have implications for the entire universe. He also worried for Usagi who had just left, the whole time that she had been there she talked about her day with Ranma and his friends. And it was that Ranma Saotome that bothered him, somehow he knew that whatever was going to happen, Ranma would be at the center of it. As he looked up at the Moon, the home of his beloved, a thought ran through his mind that chilled his soul, at the crucial moment he won't be able to save Usagi.<p>*********<p>In another room in Tokyo, a woman thrashed about in her bed. If some one were to see her they might have a hard time saying that this woman was Setsuna and not some messy twin. The whole room was in shambles, with clothes strewn across the floor and furniture overturned. Her life was just as bad as the room. The rest of the Senshi doubted her sanity and she was beginning to agree with them. A portion of her wanted with every fiber of her being to kill Ranma Saotome and another portion, the older, purer portion, knew that that was wrong. And on top of all that was the Time Gates, for some reason that wasn't apparent to her the Gates would no longer respond to her. For the first time ever the future was no longer hers to see, and that scared her more than the prospect of loosing her sanity.<p>*********<p>Down the hall from Setsuna, Hotaru lay in her bed absolutely giddy. For once in her life she knew people other than the Senshi that were not afraid of her. Whether it was her ability to heal or her ability to mimic the Death Star, Ranma and his friends treated her as an equal. She had a new friend her own age in Sasami. With Cologne and Ranma's help she is going to be stronger and able to do more transformed and untransformed. She knew that something bad was coming, she had heard the Royal Family's story and Ranma's desire to help, that means that Usagi will want to go too. But that was millions of light years away as the young woman drifted into blessed sleep and eagerly anticipated the coming of a new day.<p>*********<p>Authors Notes: Well this is the end of another chapter, sorry about the lateness of this chapter but I had several problems.<p>Problem 1: Fight scenes - I don't do fight scenes well so it took me a while to write them. That being said my brother PacMan has gone over the fights to spruce them up and make them sound better.<p>Problem 2: School - need I say more?<p>Problem 3: Family - my family isn't the sanest in the world so I have been driving various members around my city for various reasons. To give you an example, I put 150 miles on the odometer just for Pac-Man's prom.<p>Problem 4: Models - along with writing this work of fiction I also build anime models. During this chapter I started and finished a project that saw me totally redoing my 1/100 Deathsythe with the inclusion of extra joints in the shoulders and neck.<p>And finally Problem 5: I'm a lazy bastard.<p>But I have overcome these problems and have delivered this chapter to you. I hope you enjoy and any comments you may have are welcome<p>Chaos Lord<p>King of the Wicker People
