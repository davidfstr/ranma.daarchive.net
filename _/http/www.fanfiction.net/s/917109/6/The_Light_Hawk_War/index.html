</div>The Light Hawk War<p>By: Chaos Lord<p>Disclaimer: The characters in this story belong to their respective owners.  The concepts dealing with the Time Gates, the Ultimate Good and Evil, and the Forbidden belong to Pac Man.<p>********<p>Chapter 5<p>********<p>In a shrine atop a hill in Tokyo, Japan, slept a shrine maiden. She wasn't blessed with the happy wholesome dreams that others receive, no, the dreams that this woman is subjected to are dark and soul wrenching. She lies on her mat, tossing and turning as she was once again assaulted by terrible images. For several minutes she thrashes about until she bolts into a sitting position. The only things keeping the scream the she felt from being released was her will and the fact that this wasn't the first time that this had happened.<p>As she sat on her mat and tried to recover from the effects of yet another nightmare, Rei Hino silently fumed. "This fifth night in a row and it's always the same damn dream." She threw her hands into the air and looked to the heavens. "Fine. I'll ask the sacred fire. Just let me have a peaceful sleep." Rei then removed herself from her covers and walked over to her closet to retrieve her shrine clothes. Instead of putting on a fresh bra and pair of panties she just put the clothes over the sweaty ones that she had been wearing. The way she figured it by the time she was finished communing with the sacred fire anything that she might be wearing would be so sweat soaked that it would make little difference.<p>When Rei was finished getting dressed she headed for the altar that contained the sacred flame so that she may do her true calling, coaxing images out of the flame. From a very early age Rei had been able to communicate with the flame and the images she received from it were so powerful and clear that her grandfather had called higher ranking members of his order to examine her. When they saw Rei's rapport with the flame they were in awe, she was able to get better images than the greatest masters. Upon seeing her skill one master remarked, "It is as if she linked to the fire in some profound way." When Rei became Sailor Mars, the red-suited senshi of fire, she realized how accurate the master's words were.<p>As Rei entered the fire chamber she was once again humbled by the power that coursed through the room. It wasn't the flame it self that awed her, in the guise of Sailor Mars, Rei could summon fire much more intense than any found within the shrine. What truly amazed Rei was the awesome spiritual energy that flows through the room. When Rei sat before the flame she closed her eyes and extended her spirit into the flame. Once she was in contact with the spirits of the flame Rei opened her eyes and addressed her flaming oracle. "Oh sacred fire, please, tell me why am I having these dreams? What does it mean?" Rei stared into the fire for a minute and then she was enveloped in a blinding white flash.<p>When the light receded Rei found herself in what was becoming one of her own private hells. She was in her dream. Rei stood in the middle of one of the streets that headed to the center on Tokyo. The buildings that stood on either side of the lane would have been considered beautiful if it were not for the fact that pieces of them were broken off and the buildings them selves were burning in a hellish fire. As Rei stood there she once again noted how quiet it was, even the flames, which burned so fierce and free, yet gave not a single whisper.<p>That was when the part if the dream that Rei truly feared began. Into the deafening silence came the moans of people who were injured and in pain. As Rei turned in the direction of the moans she silently hoped that it was merely people in pain and not the horror that she knew that it was. When she was facing the source of the moans Rei had to suppress a scream of rage and sorrow.<p>What lie before Rei was a truly terrible sight. The tall tower of Crystal Tokyo was shattered into a million pieces. But that wasn't as bad as what was on the ground. Her friends and fellow senshi were before her in various states of death.<p>Ami, the brains of their group, was encased in a block of ice. The blue haired senshi was kneeling on the ground with her arms up as if trying to ward off the attack that killed her.<p>On a wall with the Silence Glaive embedded in her chest was Hotaru in her guise as Sailor Saturn. The strength of her attacker is evident in both that the person was able to take the glaive from Saturn and the fact that only the spiked end protruded out of her chest. The rest of the mighty weapon was embedded into the magically reinforced crystal that constituted for the city's construction.<p>Near the fallen Saturn lay her parents, Sailors Uranus and Neptune. Haruka lay upon her lover in a manner that suggested that when she died, Haruka was trying to protect Michiru. But instead of protecting all Haruka was expedite her own death which was caused by the Space Sword being thrown with so much force that it drove through both of the girls chests.<p>On the opposite side of the street and twenty feet away from where Rei was standing laid the corpse of Sailor Jupiter. Steam wafted from the crescent shaped hole in Makoto's dead body.<p>Across the street from the dead body of Makoto lay the decapitated body of Sailor Venus. Minako's arms were splayed out and her hand was still in the pose that she used to fire the crescent beam that killed her comrade-in-arms. Rei looked for several seconds for her friend's head and she found it at her feet. The shocked expression that adorned her face when she accidentally killed her friend was still present on her decapitated head.<p>These sights were not as bad as the one that Rei would soon be subjected to. In the distance she saw something glittering in the firelight and, wanting to get away from the carnage that surrounded her, she ran towards the light. But when she got there she wished had stayed with the bodies of her friends.<p>At the base of a chunk of crystal lay chibi-Moon. Usa was cut in half from the top of her pink haired head to her crotch.<p>Several feet away, up against a wall was the body of Tuxedo Mask. Mamoru was pinned to the wall by way of one of his roses stuck through each hand. His face was beaten and bloody and the white mask that went along with the costume was no where to be found. The method of this man's death was pretty obvious since his cane was sticking out of his neck.<p>If the father and daughter were not enough to break Rei's spirit then the state of the mother was. Sailor Moon was attached to a crystal spear that was sticking out of the ground. The wings that graced her super form were ripped off and her attacker had used them to pin her to the spear. Besides the two wings protruding from her shoulders there was no other injuries to the world's savior. In Rei's opinion Usagi's death was the most painful, for while the others died quickly, Usagi slowly bleed to death with the knowledge that she had failed her family, her friends, and her world. The agony of that knowledge was still evident on the dead girl's face.<p>This final image of death was too much for Rei to take. For five nights she has been forced to see this image over and over. While she has had dreams that involved the death of those she holds dear it was never as violent and real as this one. So, not being able to handle it any more Rei dropped to her knees and screamed to the heavens, "WHY?" After that Rei began to cry.<p>Soon a wind starts to blow and a white light forms where the wind originated. Rei looked up at the light in wonder, in all the times she has had this dream there was never any wind or white light. For several seconds the light got bigger and more intense until a man walked through it. As soon as the man had both feet on the ground the light which had gotten as bright as the sun simply ceased to be. It took a minute for Rei's eyes to adjust to the sudden change in light, but when she could see again Rei was stunned. Standing right in front of her was her grandfather. Not caring how or why he was in her dream, Rei latched on to the small man like one would clutch a life preserver.<p>For several minutes Grandpa Hino held his granddaughter as she cried her sorrows away. To cheer her up the old man said, "Shh, there now. Remember, this is just a dream."<p>Rei pulled away from her grandfather, "No it isn't. This is going to happen. If it is in my dream then it is the future."<p>The expression on his face changed to one Rei couldn't read. "This is merely a possible future. The future depends on the actions of people, and no one, not you and definitely not Setsuna, can see it all. All a person can see is one or two possible futures."<p>Rei grabbed her grandfather's robes like a mad woman. "Why'd this happen? How can we stop it? HOW?" After that Rei realized what she was doing and released her grandfather's robes.<p>"Why, that is a simple answer. Arrogance, stupidity, and fear led to this destruction." Seeing the look on Rei's face the man decided to clarify his last statement. "In the future that leads to this, you Senshi become arrogant. You came to feel that since you had the power it was your right to tell those who didn't have power what to do. Mind you, you didn't sound so cold and ugly when you finally stated your intentions, but the end translation was the same, we have power we rule. You Senshi have always been stupid, in fact the smartest of you is not Ami but Usagi. Unlike you others who defer to the cats or Setsuna at every turn, when it truly matters Usagi listens to her heart, and because of that this world has been saved many times. Unfortunately as time goes on she will begin to differ to those "wiser" than her and then it will be beginning of your fall. Rei there is something you must know, there are aliens on Earth."<p>Despite being angry at her grandfather's words Rei immediately whipped out her henshin wand when she heard that. "What, where?" When she looked to her grandfather Rei saw the disappointment on his face.<p>"Do you see what I mean about fear. When I said that there are aliens on Earth you immediately looked for something to attack. This attitude will lead to your fall. When you came to power and decreed that you would seek out and destroy all the aliens on Earth, you ran off those that are necessary to prevent this. What you didn't consider is that not all aliens are evil.<p>"As for how this can be stopped, look." With that the old man pointed up and behind Rei.<p>Rei turned in the direction that her grandfather indicated and what she saw amazed her. Floating above the Earth was a large woman. Now she wasn't fat just really tall. Her eyes were cold and mean, and a malicious smirk graced her lips. In front of this evil woman flitted three regular sized people. Two of them were men and the other was a woman. One man was in black robes the other man was in white robes and the woman had red robes. Each had a sword the color of their robes and red and white were fighting black. For several minutes red and white were beating black then red made a mistake and received the man in black's sword through her chest.  At seeing his partner dead, white screamed in rage and sorrow and killed black. But white's victory was short lived because the large woman killed him with a blast of power. Soon the woman disappeared and everything but Rei and her grandfather were covered in darkness.<p>"So you see, the final result of your actions is the end of all. But even now there is hope. If you and the other Senshi change your ways it will go a long way toward saving all you hold dear. There is one other thing that you must do," with that there was a flash beside the elderly man and a much younger man appeared in his place.<p>This man had a powerful yet graceful frame that was covered in Chinese style clothes. His face was kind and his blue eyes were filled with an inner pain. Yet amongst this pain Rei observed a will to overcome any obstacle. He had raven-black hair that was pulled into a ponytail.<p>"Look carefully Rei and remember this man's face. For he is Ranma Saotome and it is he who will determine the fate of the universe. Meet him, gain his trust, but no harm should come to him." When his final words were spoken everything vanished and Rei found herself in front of the sacred fire once more. She looked to the small clock that hung on the wall and was astounded that from the time that she entered the room to now only ten minutes had passed. Rei quickly ran to her room so that she could call her fellow senshi.<p>*********<p>In the black expanse that Rei just left, stood the entity that pretended to be Rei's grandfather. He extended his senses and tapped into his very soul. As he did so he was able to witness the effects to the time stream that the change he just made would have. After watching long enough to determine if his pawn, Ranma Saotome, would be able to continue on his path unfettered by the Senshi he clapped his hands in satisfaction. His body then disappeared as he dropped the illusion that he was maintaining and he rejoined the unending time stream.<p>*********<p>In her room Rei had just finished calling the other Senshi. Though there were several rather colorful metaphors flung by Haruka everyone said that they would come. Even Usagi, who has always been rather vocal about early meetings didn't utter a single peep in opposition.<p>After ending her conversation with the final Senshi on her list, Rei gathered some fresh clothes so she could take a shower. When she passed her grandfather in the kitchen she set her clothes down and gave the elderly man a great big bear hug. Rei held him for several seconds then put him down, gathered her clothes, and headed to the furo.<p>Grandpa Hino turned to his assistant Yuuichirou and asked, "Now what was that about."<p>The defunct singer shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows. You know how Rei gets at times."<p>*********<p>Sitting around the short table were all the Senshi but Rei and Setsuna. Each girl at the table wondered what could be so important that Rei would call them over at such an early hour. Even Mamoru was present at this meeting, which was surprising to some of the Senshi.<p>For his part Mamoru was a little scared. After Galaxia, all the Senshi but Usagi and Setsuna had come over to his apartment and given him a rather vocal dressing down. The told him that he had better start treating Usagi better or some nasty things might happen to him. Haruka said it best when she told him, "Since you are our king we can't kill you but we can put you in traction." Of course they all got a punch or a kick in to emphasize that they mean business. Mamoru rubbed his still sore shin and thought, "Who would have thought that Ami could kick that hard." Mamoru got their message and started taking his and Usagi's relationship seriously and when he did so he was pleasantly surprised. While Usagi will not let their activities go all the way what they have done is enough to make his eyes cross.<p>When Rei finally arrived, her hair was still wet and she was apologizing profusely, "I'm so sorry. I fell asleep in the furo," she admitted in an embarrassed tone.<p>"So what's so important that you called us this early," Haruka grumbled. While she didn't mind coming to meetings anymore she did mind having her "quality time" with Michiru interrupted. Ever since Galaxia Haruka and Michiru have been coming to every meeting. Shortly after the final battle Usagi held a meeting and commanded Haruka and Michiru to attend. It was that meeting that caused Haruka to truly fear someone because she saw what few had, a truly pissed off Usagi. And unlike other times that this had happened, Usagi had the full backing of the crystal. Needless to say, the floating hair and white glowing eyes convinced the wayward Senshi who was boss. Usagi was angry for two reasons: first, she had murdered her fellow Senshi, and second, her plan failed. If Usagi's accusations weren't enough then the look that was on Hotaru's face when her "Papa" killed her pushed her actions home. Usagi had said that if they tried something like that again then she would strip them of their power. So ever since that meeting it was the Sailor Senshi and Pluto, whereas before it was the inners and outers.<p>Rei looked at Haruka and understood the cause of the blonde-hared Senshi's ire and answered simply. "I've had another vision."<p>When Rei said that all traces of humor on the part of the assembled group vanished and everyone was paying attention to the Senshi of Mars. Even Usagi, who would be crying at this point, disengaged herself from Mamoru and took on a serious attitude. "Rei what was the vision about?"<p>Rei sighed and sat next to Usagi. "The first part is to terrible to say and I don't want to think about it. Let's just say you were all dead and Crystal Tokyo was in ruins. All that really affected me and Grandpa came a cheered me up. He also told me that we were the cause of the destruction." A chorus of outrage followed that announcement.<p>The rowdy crowd was silenced by the simplest of gestures. Usagi merely raised her hand and all the yelling came to a stop. "Everyone this is important, please let Rei finish." She then turned to Rei, "Go on."<p>Rei was once again stunned at the authority that Usagi could summon should the need arise. "Right, he said the when Usagi became queen we didn't go into ruling the right way and it basically became a dictatorship.  Also, he said the way we blindly follow whatever Artimis, Luna, and Setsuna say also get us into trouble. He said the one we should be listening to is Usagi."<p>Haruka had no problem with that last statement at all. She had seen how Usagi had followed only the advice in her heart and save the world. Haruka had vowed that she would try to be more like Usagi in her judgment of people and situations.<p>"Grandpa also said that there are aliens on Earth and when we come to power we scare them off the planet. Unfortunately, they would have been able to help us save the world. "<p>"He did say how we could stop the destruction of the world. First we have to change how we do things. The second thing we have to do is protect a guy named Ranma Saotome."<p>Makoto got a look of recognition on her face. "Hey Rei, did you get a look at the guy."<p>Everyone in the room including Rei rolled their eyes, they all thought that the brown-hared Senshi of thunder was looking for a new boyfriend. Despite this Rei answered anyway, "Yeah, he has black hair pulled in a pigtail, deep blue eyes, and is a little taller than me. Why?"<p>Makoto slammed a fist into her open palm. "I knew it! The guy we're s'posed to protect is a legend."<p>"What!"<p>"Yeah. I subscribe to a martial arts magazine and in it they have a section about extreme martial artists."<p>"So what does the magazine say about him," asked Ami.<p>Makoto's face got that faraway look that one gets when they are trying to remember information. "According to the magazine, he is really powerful and he fights weird things when he isn't defending himself form the other martial artists. He's supposed to be able to do things that we can only do when we are in our Senshi forms"<p>"Ok, so we have to protect a martial arts wiz," summed up Minako. "So where do we find him? Did your vision tell you Rei?"<p>Just then, Setsuna barged in with the answer.<p>*********<p>After Tokimi realized that everything that she did to kill Ranma only made him stronger, the insanity that had been kept in relative check erupted violently. She showed her pawn Sailor Pluto that Ranma was using the energy that the brothers had warned the pathetic mortals of. Once Tokimi was sure that the foolish girl had comprehended what she was dealing with she left the girl's mind.<p>After Tokimi released her hold on Setsuna, the Senshi of Pluto was in a panic. It had finally happened, someone was using the power that God had warned them about. He will destroy everything. "I have got to warn the others. We must go and kill this Ranma Saotome." It should be noted that having a mentally unstable goddess using you as a puppet for several millennia isn't conducive to one's mental health. So this decision on the part of Setsuna was not a well thought out as it could be.<p>So Setsuna pointed her talisman at the Timegate and willed it to show her where the other Senshi were located. "Excellent, they are all in one place," so Setsuna teleported to the shrine.<p>*********<p>In the room that Setsuna just left, the Timegates were swirling with prismatic colors and if one were there to listen they would swear that laughter was coming from the ancient structure.<p>*********<p>When the green-hared Senshi of Pluto barged into the shrine the others were shocked. Despite the fact that Setsuna was in a pristine fuku, her hair was a mess. Add that to her crazed expression and you have one wacky looking woman.<p>"Everyone, come quick there's a threat to Crystal Tokyo."<p>Several of the Senshi summoned their transformation wands while the rest just gapped at Setsuna's appearance. The one who was completely calm was Rei, she had remembered her Grandfather's words concerning Setsuna's ability to see the future. That warning made Rei cautious of anything the Senshi of Pluto might say. "We know."<p>Setsuna was so out of it she didn't even think to ask how they knew about the danger. She just nodded her head and said, "Good, now help me kill Ranma Saotome."<p>At that every Senshi in the room other than Pluto turned to face Usagi. After several seconds of thinking, Usagi answered the unspoken question in her most commanding voice. "No, we are not going to help you kill him."<p>"NO, you must help me kill him. He's using the Forbidden!" If possible, Setsuna's expression became even more manic at that declaration.<p>When Luna and Artimis heard this they knew they had to say something.  "Usagi, if this person is truly using the Forbidden then it s your duty to stop him."<p>"Why? What is the Forbidden," asked Michiru.<p>Luna took up a stance as if she were teaching a classroom, if that is even possible for cats. "A thousand years before the start of the Silver Millennium, God descended and gave the royal family of the Moon the Silver Crystal. Later, he descended once more and gave the Senshi of Saturn the Silence Glaive. After each gift was given, God warned us of a powerful energy. He said that it could cause great destruction."<p>To the Senshi that listened to what Rei had said, things were not adding up. "What exactly did God say," asked Ami.<p>Artimis raised a paw, "I remember. My mother made me memorize what he said. ""Good people, be watchful. There is a power that you posses that has great destructive potential. If you find someone who wields this power treat them appropriately. For if you don't it could mean the doom of all."" I never really understood why God told us twice. But oh well."<p>The Senshi looked at each other and the same thought crossed all of their minds, "No where did he say kill."<p>Setsuna was getting tired of waiting for the rest of the group to make up its mind. "You talk it over and when you're ready to help, meet me in Nerima." At that she left and headed in the direction of Nerima.<p>As Setsuna left the room Usagi stood up and addressed her fellow Senshi. "Well don't just sit there. We have to make sure that she doesn't hurt Ranma." And with that Usagi transformed and headed after the wayward Senshi of Time.<p>The rest of the assembled Senshi sat in shock at Usagi's initiative for several seconds. After they realized that their leader had left them they transformed and followed Usagi.<p>*********<p>Sitting in the clearing wherein the space tree Funaho once resided was Ranma Saotome and his girlfriend Mihoshi Kuramitsu. Ranma was leaning against one f the trees that were surrounding the clearing and Mihoshi had her head on Ranma's shoulder.<p>After Azusa came with the news about Jurai's invasion, Ranma's trip to Nerima had been put on hold. Since then Ranma has been extremely bored, the only high points of the time have been when he was practicing his art while integrating his newfound powers into his style. Or when he and Mihoshi were spending time together. Though they are in love, they decided to hold off on sex, in either form. Despite this, the couple had managed to take several baths together and were now sharing a room and a bed.<p>"Hey Mihoshi."<p>Said girl sat up and looked into her love's eyes. "Yes?"<p>When Mihoshi did that Ranma's insides turned to goo. Whenever she would talk to him, Mihoshi would always make sure that she was looking into his eyes. That way Ranma knew that she was talking TO him, not AT him. None of his other fiancés did that and it made Ranma love her even more.<p>"It's been two weeks since I said that I needed to tie up the stuff in Nerima. Since we moved Funaho and planted mine and Tenchi's trees there isn't much for us to do besides wait for Washu to finish fixing Azusa's ship." For Azusa's ship, opening a gateway to another point in space is easy, it's getting around the time issue that is hard. When Azusa pushed his ship to get them to Earth as quickly as possible, he severely injured the ship's engine sections. Washu examined the damaged sections to see if she could speed up the tree's natural healing abilities but there was nothing that she could do that wouldn't do more damage than she fixed. Since Azusa wouldn't let them go without him and he wouldn't go without his ship they were stuck on Earth for the time being.<p>"So I think that we should go now and get everything out of the way. Besides, I want you to meet my mother."<p>"I want to meet her, and I think you're right. Why don't we go back to the house and tell everyone that we are going." Mihoshi then stood and held out her hand to Ranma.<p>Ranma took her hand and got up, "I'm glad you agree." He then put his arm around her waist and the couple started down the path back to the house.<p>*********<p>In Tenchi Masaki's bedroom, a trio was recovering from a rather lengthy love making session. Soon after her parents had arrived, Ayeka told them about her relationship with Tenchi and Ryoko. What surprised her parents and her loves the most was Ayeka's declaration that no matter what they said she would be with Ryoko and Tenchi.<p>Misaki and Funaho were happy that Ayeka had found people to love and be with. Azusa, on the other hand, was furious. Not only did she want to marry the Earth brat AND the criminal Ryoko, but she also said she was going to marry them whether he likes it or not. Unfortunately for Azusa, he is married to two very high spirited women and after a week and a half of stubbornness on his part, Funaho took him to their room. After several hours Azusa came out of the room pale and trembling with fear. When he saw his daughter he gave his blessings and then hid in his ship. He hasn't come out for three days.<p>After receiving her parents blessing, Ayeka did something none expected. A feral grin appeared on her face and she threw Tenchi over one shoulder, Ryoko went over the other one, and the princess ran upstairs to Tenchi's room. The only time they were seen for the next three days was when one would sneak off to the bathroom.<p>As she was lying on Tenchi's bed and looking over the sleeping forms of her most cherished possessions, Ryoko happily remembered that glorious day. Knowing how cautious Ayeka was, Ryoko had been willing to wait until the three of them were married. Needless to say, when Ayeka dragged them up to Tenchi's room, Ryoko was a very happy woman. As she lay there Ryoko heard a soft knock at the door. So as not to disturb Ayeka and Tenchi, Ryoko carefully floated over to the door. Before opening the door Ryoko donned Tenchi's housecoat, since there were new people living in the house she didn't want strangers to see her in all her glory. When Ryoko opened the door she saw Sasami and immediately a smile graced her features. After Washu used her regained powers to dampen the link between Sasami and Tsunami, the young girl has not been as bright and cheerful as before. Some days she would be almost normal, others she would be depressed and easily scared. Sasami had also taken to remaining near a member of the family at all times. Luckily it appeared that Sasami was in one of her brighter moods and had a soft smile adorning her face.<p>"So what's up Sasami?"<p>"Ranma wants to talk to all of us."<p>"Thanks, I'll wake Tenchi and Ayeka up and we'll be right down."<p>"On your way down can you make a stop in the furo, you stink." To emphasize this point, Sasami waved her hand in front of her nose as if she was clearing away a bad odor.<p>"Grr, why you," Ryoko playfully growled.<p>Sasami gave of a giggle and ran in the direction of the living room.<p>Ryoko smiled as she watched Sasami run off, thankful that for at least that moment Sasami was acting like herself again. After standing in front of the door for a minute and reflecting on simpler times, Ryoko walked back into Tenchi's room so that she could rouse her beloveds out of bed.<p>*********<p>Sitting on a couch across from Ranma and Mihoshi sat Funaho. As she sat she watched as the couple snuggled and waited for the others to arrive.  To Funaho, Ranma Saotome was one big question mark. Sure, she knew his history but there was one thing that the empress did not know, what was Ranma's allegiance. Tenchi and Ryoko were now bound to Jurai through their relationship with Ayeka, which consequently was one of the reasons she had approved of the match-up. But Ranma, with his relationship to Mihoshi, had no ties to Jurai other than the ones of camaraderie. As far as she was concerned, Ranma was a wild card, both in Juraian politics and in the battle to come.<p>*********<p>About five minutes after Ranma asked Sasami to get everyone, Washu sat down on the couch beside Ranma and Mihoshi. Like Funaho, Washu was watching Ranma, but unlike Funaho, Washu was also using other methods of surveillance other than her eyes to keep track of Ranma. What see saw only confirmed her beliefs in the goodness of Ranma's heart.<p>Shortly after Washu arrived so did Yosho. As usual, the priest was wearing the simple robes that he regularly donned. What many found strange about the man was that outside of serious situations he acted like the twenty-year old that he now appeared to be.<p>On the heels of Yosho's entrance came Misaki and a very grumpy Azusa.  When the emperor sat next to Funaho he made a motion as f he was going to hold his wife's hand. But before he could go too far he withdrew his hand and placed it back in his lap and if possible his expression became ever more downcast. Azusa's expression soon became one of joy as Funaho reached out and took his hand in her own.<p>As soon as Azusa entered the room the guards that had been nearly living at the dining room table sat up straighter. They had been on guard when it was just Funaho in the room, but with Azusa now in the room the guards became a little more cautious.<p>When Sasami finished getting everyone like Ranma requested she came back to the living room and immediately sat next to her mother. As soon as the young girl sat down Ryo-Oh-Ki jumped into her friend's lap.<p>Several minutes later a wet haired Tenchi and Ayeka filed in. They were followed by a floating Ryoko.<p>"Ok Ranma, we're here, now what is so important that you had Sasami drag us out of bed," asked a still groggy Ayeka.<p>Ranma blinked at the princess's more abrupt behavior. "Right. If you remember, before Azusa and his wives arrived I was going to go back to Nerima. I still need to go and the best time is now. Besides, I want to have all the stuff in Nerima finished before I go to another planet."<p>"Excellent idea, Ranma," said Funaho. "Helping you solve your problems will allow us to get our minds off our own." She then turned her head to face Azusa, "Won't it dear." To illustrate how serious she was, Funaho also squeezed Azusa's hand.<p>The objection that was about to spew for Azusa's mouth was quickly snuffed out by his wife's look. The pressure she was applying to his hand also helped. "Yes dear."<p>Knowing that such a large crowd might destroy their budget, Tenchi looked to Washu for help. "Little Washu, I don't think we can afford train tickets for all these people. Do you have a LOW KEY way to get us to Nerima?" He wanted to emphasize the low-key part, otherwise she would have suggested Ryo-Oh-Ki.<p>"I do, but first I want Yosho to return Ryoko's gems to her. She will need them for when we fight and she needs some time to get used to their full power." Now that Funaho was in a tree planter, Washu felt that her daughter's possessions, the remaining gems, should be returned to her.<p>Yosho looked unsure for several seconds as he thought about Washu's request. He came to the same conclusion that Washu did, with his tree in its proper place he could give back the gems without any detrimental effects to him or his tree. Also, the initial reason he had taken the gems was no longer applicable. Ryoko was happy in her new life and she is no danger except to those who would threaten her new life. "Very well, Tenchi you must return the sword to me."<p>Tenchi pulled the Tenchi-ken from his belt and gave it to Yosho. As Yosho reached for the blade blue electricity arced from the hilt to his hand. Yosho was once again the sword's true owner.<p>"Good, now Ryoko stand before me." Yosho waited for her to do so and when she was close enough, Yosho pointed the end with the gems at the ex- space pirate. He then extended his essence into the sword and willed the gems back to their rightful owner, Ryoko.<p>For those that were able to see it, the gems in the hilt of the Tenchi-ken glowed and then disappeared. When the glow vanished from the sword, two point of orange light formed on Ryoko's neck and right wrist. As the power of the additional gems coursed through her very being, Ryoko was in heaven. She was feeling so good that she began to float upwards. As she did so her arms were extended outwards from her body and reddish- orange electricity arced off her lithe form. She was so in awe at her regained powers that Ryoko through her head back and laughed in rapture.<p>To the others in the room, Ryoko looked kinda scary with the energy flowing around her body and her laughing didn't help to assuage their concern. Yosho was beginning to wander if it wasn't a better idea to not let Ryoko regain her gems. Where as Yosho was contemplating the rightness of his choice, Ayeka and Tenchi were of two minds on the subject. On one hand they were a little creeped out by Ryoko's display. On the other they were getting really turned on, with their joining Tenchi and Ayeka could feel a portion of what Ryoko was feeling. These feelings were helped along by the fact that from their position, Ayeka and Tenchi had a clear view of Ryoko's perfect butt.<p>After several seconds of floating and laughing Ryoko realized how she must have looked. If anyone could have seen her face they would have noticed a very evil grin as she thought of a joke she could play on the group. So she concentrated a little so as o make her eyes glow and then she looked down at Yosho. "You fool! With these gems I can now take over the world," she said evilly. In the light of the assembled group's expression, Ryoko could not contain her laughter and soon she was floating on her back as she was rolling on a metaphysical floor.<p>Upon seeing Ryoko's laughter reactions were mixed. Some were either angry, like Azusa, or still in shock, like Yosho. Washu was feeling motherly pride at seeing her daughter scare the bejesus out of the group, it was the Hakubi thing to do. Ranma was trying very hard not to laugh at Ryoko's antics. It was something that he would have done, if he had though about it.<p>Showing her ability to remain on topic despite whatever distraction that may occur, Funaho addressed Washu. "Washu, I believe you said that there was a way to transport us to Nerima less conspicuously."<p>The goddess nodded her head, "Yes I did. We will be using Light Hawk Wings to get us there."<p>In a move that was reminiscent of a certain Vulcan, Funaho raised an eyebrow and said, "Explain." This was backed by many nodding heads, especially Tenchi's and Ranma's.<p>"The trees of Jurai open subspace portals to travel long distances. Those who can use the Light Hawk Wings can do the same. There are pluses and minuses to this, the trees can go anywhere using the portals, you just point them in the right direction and off you go. The problem with that method is that the transport isn't instantaneous, the more power you put into the portal the shorter the trip. When using the wings, a person can go wherever they want in an instant. The downside of this method is that you can only open a gate to a place that you have been to.<p>"So this is how we are going to do this, Ranma will open a gate to Nerima. He will take Tenchi and Ryoko through and on the other side they will open portals so that he rest of can come."<p>"Washu, how the hell am I s'posed to do that," asked a flustered Ryoko.<p>Said goddess shook her head and acted as if she was disappointed, "To think, the daughter of the greatest scientific genius in the universe is a fool. Ok, I'll speak so you can understand my little Ryoko. You're my daughter, so therefore you have the genetic potential to use the Light Hawk Wings. The gems that you have contain all the Light Hawk Power that I had before I descended. Now that you have them you will be able to use that power."<p>"Does that mean I can use ten wings," asked an awed Ryoko. She remembered the power of Tsunami's wings from the battle with Kagato and the thought of having that much power sent chills down Ryoko's spine. Chills that were a mixture of both anticipation and dread.<p>Washu nodded and smiled at the innocent awe on her daughter's face. "In time you will be able to use all ten wings, but for now the max amount that your body can handle is five. Though I would suggest that you only use that many if you really need them."<p>Everyone in the room was amazed to one degree or another. Tenchi and Ayeka were surprised at how much more powerful Ryoko was than they were. They had always known she was powerful but they figured that she could always be trumped by Tenchi and his Light Hawk Wings.<p>At hearing this latest news Azusa was less than happy. Here was someone else that was as powerful as his goddess. And while he would never dream of attacking Ryoko, he still didn't like it.<p>Now Mihoshi took this opportunity to speak. "Why don't we pack some bags and get going. Ranma needs to go home." The assembled group agreed and went to pack themselves overnight bags, just in case.<p>Before anyone could get away Ranma had one last thing to say. "Make sure you bring some umbrellas. It will probably start raining as soon as we get there."<p>Ten minutes later the group was assembled on the dock outside the house. Ranma and Tenchi were wearing packs on their backs. The rest of the group was either storing their clothes in some extra dimensional space, Ryoko and Washu, letting the guards carry their stuff, The Royal family, or letting Ranma carry their stuff, Mihoshi. Everyone was dressed as they were in the living room and each person was carrying their own umbrella.<p>"Ok Washu, how do we do this," asked Ranma.<p>"Right. Now as I tell Ranma what to do I want you two to listen because you're going to do the same thing on the other side." As she said that, Washu was looking at Ryoko and Tenchi. "Now Ranma I want you to call up your wing." Ranma's face took on a look of concentration and then a transparent-blue Light Hawk Wing appeared before him. "Good. Now think of the place that you want to go, make the picture in your mind as clear as it can be. After you have that, imagine your wing in the area. Now picture that from your wing a string is stretched to a point in front of you. Take that string and turn it into a tunnel big enough to walk through."<p>As the group listened to Washu's instructions they also watched what Ranma's Light Hawk Wing was doing. After it appeared, the wing glowed brightly and disappeared, leaving only a floating blue dot in front of Ranma. The dot then expanded and formed a round blue-rimmed aperture.<p>Washu clapped her hands, "Good work Ranma. Now you, Ryoko, and Tenchi walk through. Tenchi, once you reach the other side you and Ryoko open portals of your own and the rest of us will join you."<p>Ryoko and Tenchi looked at each other then hugged Ayeka. They walked to the swirling portal and before they stepped through they joined hands to comfort the other. When Ryoko and Tenchi walked through the gateway it rippled like water and then returned to normal. Ranma stood and watched as two of his friends stepped through his portal and felt a twitch in the power he was using. Once the twitch was gone, Ranma knew that they had made it through. Ranma hugged Mihoshi and gave her a brief kiss on the lips then stepped through his own portal. After a brief disorientation Ranma was where he had imagined and he was being rained on. By the time Ranma had his umbrella out and opened he was soaked and it had stopped raining. He looked over to the equally soaked Tenchi and Ryoko and threw them a wry grin, "I told you we'd need umbrellas. I swear this damn town hates me."<p>Ryoko and Tenchi just nodded their heads dumbly. Who would have though Ranma would be right about it raining when they got to Nerima? After several seconds Ryoko slapped her head in frustration, "Damnit! I forgot to ask Washu how to use these blasted wings."<p>Tenchi placed his hand on his love's shoulder. "Don't worry about it. Ranma and I can tell you how we use ours and you can try that," he turned his head to look at Ranma, "right?"<p>Ranma nodded, "Yeah sure! It's real easy just look inside yourself and find the power. When you find it, will out of your body. It's easy."<p>Ryoko gave Ranma a look that said, "Yeah right bub, real easy." But she sighed and closed her eyes. Ryoko looked for a power that was different than the one she normally used yet felt similar. This was difficult for Ryoko since she had never truly explored her power before, it had always been a matter of want to do something and her powers did it. Now though as she looked inwardly upon her power she saw that the power ran along her body through channels that start from her gems. From these rivers of power flowed smaller tributaries that suffused her entire being with energy. After searching her body and finding nothing she looked to her gems. She searched each gem starting in the one she had the longest, the gem on her left wrist. After finding nothing there she continued to the gem on her right wrist, and then the one on her neck. It was in this gem that Ryoko hit pay dirt, unlike the other gems that glowed like light bulbs, the one in her neck glowed as bright as a star. When Ryoko touched the light her entire being was filled with Light Hawk energy. It was then that Ryoko realized the nature of the gems, the ones embedded in her wrists supplied her with her regular powers exclusively. It was the one in her neck that contained the entirety of her Light Hawk power, yet she would be unable to access it without the presence of the other gems. After touching the vast power at her disposal, Ryoko did as Ranma said and willed the energy to a point outside her body. When she opened her eyes she saw four red Light Hawk Wings floating before her. She turned her head towards her companions and despite their wide-eyed stare all she could say was, "Wow."<p>As Ranma and Tenchi watched Ryoko search for her power they were treated to a spectacle of lights. Several seconds after closing her eyes her entire body began to glow red. Shortly thereafter Ryoko shook her head and the red glow vanished. Next they witnessed as the gem on her left wrist began to glow a dull red. Then the gem on her right wrist began to glow the same color. When the gem in Ryoko's neck began to glow that was when the real fireworks began. Where the other gems glowed a dull red, her neck gem glowed a bright fiery red. Ryoko's face lit up in satisfaction and awe. From the gem came red energy that swirled around her body. Out of this red energy formed four red Light Hawk Wings. The wings floated upright and spun around once, then they flew in front of Ryoko and formed into an "X". Ranma and Tenchi stared in awe at the display and where only brought out of their staring by Ryoko's, "Wow."<p>Ranma then realized how much time they had spent dawdling and said, "You guys better make the portals. You know how Washu gets when you make her wait." A look of mild dread passed over the faces of Ryoko and Tenchi at the thought of an unhappy Washu. They quickly went through the steps that Washu had given Ranma and opened their own portals. Tenchi's portal looked exactly like Ranma's but was much larger, Ryoko's portal was larger than Tenchi's and instead of being blue the portal was red.<p>The portals stood there for several seconds until Washu strode through the red portal, several seconds later the others came through the portals. Washu walked up to Tenchi and Ryoko and started talking to them. "What took so long with the gates?"<p>Ryoko looked at her mother darkly. "Well if SOMBODY hadn't forgot to tell me how to use my wings we might have been quicker. But as it is Ranma and Tenchi had to tell me."<p>The impatient look on Washu's face quickly faded once she heard what her daughter had said and she looked rather apologetic. "Sorry, I forgot."<p>Ryoko's dark look immediately disappeared and she smiled at her mother. "No problem." She also sent to her mother, ["An apology is all I ask. Thanks."]<p>Washu smiled at her daughter and sent back, ["You're welcome, my little Ryoko."]<p>Ranma clapped his hands once to get everyone's attention, "Well if we're all ready, lets get a move on." This was accompanied by a chorus of assents and some grumbling on Azusa's part. And so the group headed off towards the Tendo Dojo.<p>After several minutes of walking the group hit concrete. As soon as Ranma step foot on the hard surface his senses went into overdrive as he looked for anything that might try to attack. Tree, wall, or gopher, in Nerima anything and everything was a potential aggressor.<p>It was this increased vigilance that allowed Ranma to spot the man walking towards him. In fact he wasn't that hard to miss given that he was wearing a red cloak wrapped around his frame. But unlike the others who gave the man only a passing glance as they marveled at the various signs of destruction, Ranma was keenly watching him, for he moved like a fighter. Of course the fact that the man had his head down and a wind was dramatically blowing the red bandanna around his head and not his cloak didn't add to Ranma's threat assessment of the man. The man continued walking towards the group until he came to a stop before Ranma and raised his head to look at him. Ranma was now really tensed ready to do battle at a moment's notice. He was ready to defend himself and his girlfriend as the man extended his arm out of the cloak and Ranma was about to jump out of the way with Mihoshi when he saw what was in the man's hand. Out of the myriad of things that Ranma was expecting, knives, shuriken, a cruise missile, a simple photograph was not what he expected.<p>The photo was old and faded and had the look of being in someone's pocket for a long time. The picture depicted a man with someone on his shoulders but who this person was unclear since that part of the picture had been torn away. "Excuse me," the man said. "Do you know this man?" Everyone looked closely at the photo and shook their heads. The man began to growl then threw his head and arms back and screamed to the heavens. "DAMM YOU KYOJI! I'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO OUR PARENTS!" This declaration was backed by several lightning bolts dramatically striking the ground behind the obviously insane man. With that the man continued walking in the direction that he had been walking.<p>Several seconds later a woman with brown hair and large golden earrings ran up and bowed to the group. "Please excuse my friend. He's a little . . . off." With that she took off after the insane man.<p>The group just stood there looking at the spot the woman and man had vacated until Ryoko commented with, "Daaammmnnn. You said this place was screwed up, but I never thought it was this bad." The assembled group nodded their heads.<p>After getting creeped out by the surroundings, Mihoshi moved from just holding Ranma's hand to holding his entire arm. Once she did so Mihoshi sighed in comfort. Seeing Mihoshi's actions several other of the couples decided to do the same thing. Soon Tenchi was in between Ryoko and Ayeka while both girls had a firm hold on his arms. Surprisingly, Azusa was in the same position. He wasn't confused about Misaki's body pressed against his, but he was confused about Funaho's actions. Usually she preferred to keep their love life private so when he looked at her questioningly, her answer of, "When on Earth," really threw Azusa for a loop.<p>Ranma, who was reveling in the sensation of having Mihoshi pressed against him with his arm firmly placed between her ample breasts, had totally forgotten why they were there. The others were too busy with their significant others or boggling at the weirdness that they had just witnessed to remember why they were there. But one person remembered, to the man known as Yosho his presence was for more than just emotional support. No, Yosho was on a far deadlier mission than the others, and no one, even his father would stop him from fulfilling his mission. Yosho cleared his throat to get Ranma's attention, "Ehem, Ranma? Don't forget about why we are here."<p>At Yosho's words, the women induced hazes in the eyes of the other men quickly vanished. Ranma nodded his head at Yosho, "Thanks, I got a little side tracked there."<p>Yosho smiled at the youth. "No problem. I too have experienced the joy of having a beautiful woman attached to my arm."<p>Ranma's only reply was to look into Mihoshi's eyes, smile, and kiss her on the forehead. After several seconds of starring into the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen, Ranma headed towards the place that had been his home after so many years of travel. As he walked he was amazed that he wasn't nervous at all. If you had told Ranma six months ago that he would be in a loving relationship with a beautiful woman that was not a fiancée, he would have laughed in your face. Then he would have nervously waited for the horde of angry women out to punish him for listening to such ideas. Now though, he got a warm feeling throughout his body at the thought of introducing his girlfriend to his family. He looked at said girlfriend and saw her rather nervous expression. "Hey, what's wrong?"<p>Mihoshi looked at the man she loved, the one who had filled the void in her life so exactly and gave him a weak smile. "I'm just nervous, I mean I want your parents to like me. I'm also worried about how your fiancées will handle us being together."<p>Ranma gave her one of his roguish grins that he knew she loved. "Don't worry, Mom will love you, s'pecially since she thinks she's going to get grandchildren. Genma, well if he doesn't like you then he's dumber than I thought." His look then became dark, "As for the fiancées. Well, if they can't handle that I found a girl that I love then tough. They had their chance and they blew it." The grin then reappeared, "So don't worry, ok."<p>Mihoshi's whole demeanor brightened, "You're right." She kissed Ranma on the cheek in gratitude.<p>"So Ranma, what should we expect when we reach our destination," asked Ayeka.<p>"Two grown men who are crying and yelling at the same time. Some accusations that I'm dating Funaho and Misaki. My mother dancing and throwing confetti, celebrating my supposed harem and all the grandchildren that are on the way. Kasumi will probably offer us cookies and drinks. And then some of the girls that are after me will show up and try to punish me for leaving them for older women." As he finished Ranma shrugged his shoulders at idiocy of it all.<p>After hearing Ranma's prediction of their upcoming encounter with his family and friends, Ayeka was very perturbed. This was made evident by the twitch that had developed in her right eye.<p>On the other hand Ryoko was laughing her ass off. Just the thought of Misaki in a relationship with Ranma was hilarious. Just the look on Ranma's face the first time Misaki had seen his female form was priceless.<p>Someone else found the entire situation humorous, Sasami. With her mother around Sasami's mood was better but she still wasn't the happy child that she had been before her psychic link with Tsunami. From time to time she had laughed, usually because of something that Ranma had done or something that had been done to him.<p>When they finally reached the dojo gates Ranma stopped before entering. "Everyone stand back a little bit, I need to make a phone call."  Everyone did as Ranma asked, though they were very confused. After the group was far enough away Ranma extended his aura outward, making sure that as he did so he wasn't utilizing just one emotion. As Ranma had gone over the instructions that Cologne had given him he had come across some startling information, using one type of Ki was very dangerous to a person's mental and physical health. Apparently when one uses a single emotion as a source of power that emotion becomes stronger and easier felt.  As in the case of Ryouga and Akane the emotions that they use became more and more explosive. The way Ranma and then later on Katsuhito figured, Ryouga was in the greatest danger from his reliance on depression based Ki. As the ease of depression became greater and greater the possibility of Ryouga committing suicide also increased. Ranma realized that he was also in danger from his reliance on confidence as a source of power. Though he wasn't as bad off as Ryouga or Akane since confidence wasn't as heavy as those other emotions, Ranma did see a problem. With Mihoshi as a sounding board for ideas and theories Ranma came to the conclusion that many of his defeats had not been caused by lack of skill but by an overconfidence in his own skills. This in turn caused Ranma to underestimate his opponent and play with them, thereby showing him or her that Ranma Saotome was naturally superior to all others. This attitude, Ranma realized, would get him killed just as easily as any suicide attempt. After much soul searching and fighting of inner demons, Ranma now uses all of his emotions combined. The only sticking point is that confidence seems to been in a greater supply, a side effect of his prior actions, though this problem seems to be fixing itself the more he uses his Ki.<p>*********<p>To the others Ranma began to glow a yellow tinged white as his aura extended into the visible spectrum. As Mihoshi watched her beloved show his skill, she smiled that smile that only a woman in love can truly accomplish. While Ranma might be using all of his emotions, with her training Mihoshi can pick out the one most important to her, love. As Ranma had trained her he had struggled with the task of helping her channel her alien life force like he did his human one. After many days of trying Mihoshi and Ranma finally had tumbled upon a way for her to use her version of Ki. Once this happened Mihoshi's skills increased dramatically. By her third day she was already jumping onto the roof of the house and forming an aura, albeit a small one. Apparently Mihoshi was a natural, all she needed was someone to open the lock protecting her potential.<p>*********<p>When Ranma started to glow Washu immediately whipped out her computer. Despite her remembered knowledge and power Washu still trusted her equipment, especially when it comes to humans. When her sensors first detected the energies that Ranma used she was astounded. He was nearly as strong as a Juraian with a fully functional tree ship. What was even more amazing was that he generated this energy unaided and that every time she scanned him his energy output had increased, even if it was just a tiny increase. A Juraian has a set limit to the amount of energy they might have, but for Ranma, it seemed as if this "Ki" was limitless. It also befuddled Washu how he was able to hide all that energy. One moment her sensors would be detecting his vast stores of energy the next he was reading at normal energy levels for a human and when he was using his invisibility techniques the energy output dropped to zero. The only thing that kept her from going crazy was the fact that his Juraian and Light Hawk powers behaved normally.<p>*********<p>As she watched Ranma extend his aura Funaho was once again amazed with the young man known as Ranma Saotome. When she was a young girl in Japan the energy known as Ki was known to exist. The shrine priests and priestesses used this energy to communicate with the spirit via fire or other mediums. It was also believed that one or two of the martial arts masters could use their life-force to increase their speed and strength and even use it as a weapon. But all of these people had been studying in their chosen fields for four or five decades and had only started using their Ki late in life. That Ranma was using his Ki with such skill after little more than a decade amazed Funaho.<p>*********<p>As Azusa watched Ranma he huffed and looked like he really didn't want to be there. Inwardly he was just as amazed as Funaho. He had remembered the concept of Ki from when he had been on earth all those years ago and he understood what it meant for Ranma to use his the way he does. Azusa then looked over at his daughter Ayeka and sighed. As a father Azusa was overjoyed that Ayeka could find people who loved her for who she was and not for her title. As emperor though, Ayeka's decision was very disheartening. She wanted to marry the space pirate Ryoko, a woman who had destroyed a great deal of their home during her reign of terror. What was worse was that she was in love with a man that Azusa considered a pacifist and this was totally unacceptable. The future ruler of the empire should be a strong and virtuous warrior, not someone who would let others walk all over him. On the other hand, with a little fine-tuning, Ranma would be a perfect candidate for emperor, but alas it was not meant to be.<p>*********<p>After a minute of having his aura extended Ranma was sure those who he was trying to reach had sensed him so he pulled his aura back into himself. He turned and looked to the group, "Ok, I'm done. Ready to go inside?"<p>Immediately Mihoshi walked up to Ranma and took his hand. "Yep, let's go."<p>"Great!" Ranma and Mihoshi turned to face the gate. The walked up and each pushed a door open. As the group walked towards the door they noticed piles of broken bricks scattered across the yard. As he reached the door he raised his hand to knock, but before he struck the wood Ranma hesitated. A gentle pressure on his hand from Mihoshi was all the comfort he needed and he knocked on the door.<p>After several seconds of waiting the door opened to reveal Kasumi. Once she got a look at who was at the door the smile that was firmly ratcheted to her face broke and was replaced with one of surprise. "Ranma?"<p>Ranma gave a little wave, "Hey Kasumi. Nice to see you."<p>A smile, a real honest to god smile lit up Kasumi's face as she lunged forwards and enveloped Ranma in a hug. "Oh Ranma, we missed you so much. It's so good to see you again." She then pulled away from him. "You look different somehow, more happy and calm than I have ever seen you." While she was ecstatic to see the one she had come to consider a little brother, she was also very disturbed. Something about Ranma's was different. It was like the pupils were, narrower? Of course being the polite person that she was, Kasumi decided not to mention it.<p>"Yeah? Well if I look any better it is because of my friends here," said Ranma as he gestured to the group of people behind him. "And of course Mihoshi here also helped."<p>Kasumi's eyes widened dramatically, "So you finally found someone. Father will not approve but as long as you are happy then you'll have my support."<p>"Thanks, I really appreciate that, and I am happy," he looked at Mihoshi and smiled. "I think I'm the happiest that I've ever been."<p>Kasumi smiled, "So are you going to introduce your friends to me?"<p>"Can we wait until everyone gets here? I don't want to do this over ad over again."<p>"Of course." She turned to the side and gestured inside. "Come in please. Friends of Ranma are friends of mine."<p>The group filed in and took off their shoes. Ranma and Mihoshi donned the slippers meant for guests while everyone else put on slippers provided from the packs the guards were carrying. Once everyone had the proper footwear Kasumi led them to the family room to sit and get comfortable.<p>When Ranma entered the family room time seemed to slow to a standstill as several things happened. Akane took on a look of happiness only to have it quickly replaced by unbridled fury. Nabiki looked up from her manga and upon noticing Ranma she had a huge smile that dimmed but a little upon seeing Ranma's hand holding Mihoshi's in a loving manner. His mother who had just exited the kitchen saw Ranma and Mihoshi's intertwined hands and immediately began a happy-dance that only a mother expecting grandchildren could produce. The fathers immediately jumped up and began to head at Ranma, all the while berating him for leaving his fiancé. All of this was more or less expected by Ranma. What wasn't expected was Yosho rushing towards Genma all the while yelling, "Die you bastard!"<p>*********<p>When Akane saw Ranma walk in the Tendo family room she was ecstatic. When Ranma had gone into the Neko-Ken all those months ago she had been scared, not because he was in his feral state, no what truly terrified Akane Tendo was Ranma's response to seeing her. She had not seen the happy kitty that always appeared in that state. What she saw was a scared and sad creature who didn't know who to trust. Over the intervening months she had thought long and hard about her feelings for Ranma and she had come to the conclusion that was in love with the baka.<p>Unfortunately, for Akane, when she saw the intertwined hands of Ranma and Mihoshi, the way they stood next to each other, all of her hopes and dreams that had been built up crumbled to ashes. And with those hopes and dreams went her heart and left Akane Tendo with a wide gaping chasm. Into this seemingly unending sea of pain and despair flew the one emotion that she knew better than any other, anger. A vile, horrid anger that rises up and consumes all that is good and decent in a human being, and in this moment Akane Tendo decided that she would kill that blonde hared gaijin bitch.<p>*********<p>Nabiki Tendo was doing what she usually did on Sundays, laze around reading manga. Since Ranma left on his quest to overcome the Neko-Ken life had become rather boring. There was a bright spot in the doldrums, her friends. Yes that's right, Nabiki Tendo, Ice Queen of Furinkan High, has friends. The idea had come to Nabiki shortly after Ranma had left. Who were the only people her age who were disliked almost as much as she was? The girls that worked for her, of course. The main reason Nabiki had chosen the girls was that they had little or no allegiances to others so they would be less likely to divulge critical information. After some prodding Nabiki realized that they were just as lonely as her so she made a proposition. At school they would be colleagues and away from school they could try their hands at friendship, no strings attached. Needless to say, Nabiki was pleasantly surprised when they all jumped on the chance to have some friends.<p>The incessant boredom was slightly lifted by a knock at the door. When Kasumi didn't immediately return Nabiki's interest was peaked higher. Soon an entire group of people had entered the living room and who was at the head of the group? Ranma! Sure she had realized that she would never be able to be with him given their past, but Nabiki had still held a small hope that he might return to her. That hope was dashed when she saw Ranma holding the hand of a very beautiful blonde woman with some exotic features. But unlike her sister, Akane, Nabiki did not despair she was simply happy that Ranma was happy. And if the way Ranma's eyes looked was any indication, he was very happy indeed. Speaking of eyes, Ranma's pupils looked narrower and his canines looked longer. What the hell is happening to him?<p>*********<p>As Nodoka Saotome washed dishes she gave a sigh. It had been months since Ranma had left and she missed her little boy. After Ranma had left Nodoka took it upon herself to start to take a more active role in the lives of the Tendo daughters. It was her hope that by having a more mature adult to look to the girls, especially Kasumi, could act their age.<p>Wondering why Kasumi was taking so long to answer the door, Nodoka left the kitchen. When she entered the family room she saw a sight that made her heart leap in joy. Her son, her darling little boy, had returned.  As she looked at Ranma she noticed something that made her ever more excited, Ranma loving holding the hand of a beautiful woman. Upon seeing this, Nodoka's motherly instincts came to the fore and, in the proud tradition of all the mothers that had come before her, Nodoka Saotome threw her own little party.<p>*********<p>After that spectacle that Ranma had given at the high school, Genma and Soun decided to punish the disrespectful child. The punishment that they felt was most worthy was to deny Ranma of their glorious presence until he apologized and agreed to marry Akane. I.E. there were scared of Ranma and were waiting for him to crawl back to them. After several months of waiting they were beginning to wonder whether or not Ranma was going to be returning. So in tried and true Genma and Soun style they went out and searched for the wayward martial artist. They looked everywhere for Ranma, and in their pursuit they left not a single bar unsearched. Of course, once they had searched the bar they had an obligation as men to buy a drink. But alas, despite their tireless efforts they uncovered no traces of Ranma.<p>When Ranma came back Genma and Soun jumped and began to remind that he shouldn't leave his poor, defenseless fiancé behind. As Genma was instructing Ranma on the finer points of manhood, he never noticed a young man making his way towards him until he heard the young man scream, "Die you bastard!" Genma was frozen in shock since this usually happened to Ranma and not him.<p>*********<p>As Yosho entered the family room of Tendo residence his blood, which had been simmering all day, began to boil. He had finally found him, one of the most evil beings in existence. As far as Yosho was concerned, Genma Saotome is one of the most vile creatures on this globe. His actions against Ranma were but one of the things Yosho holds against the man. Upon seeing Genma, all of Yosho's rage burst violently outwards and in a less than normal display of anger Yosho charged headfirst towards Genma. As he ran Yosho extended his arm and into his open hand flew the Tenchi-ken. He only ignited the blade in the final few seconds before he struck Genma. As the blade made it's way towards splitting Genma's head in two feeling of calm passed over Yosho. "Finally my love, you have been avenged."<p>*********<p>As the blade of the Tenchi-ken descended towards his father's skull, Ranma extended his arm and, more importantly, his will right in front of Genma. When the blue blade reached that point it impacted with the full might of a Light Hawk Wing.<p>When his blade struck the barrier Yosho was stunned for a moment. It was in this moment that the guards fell on Yosho and restrained him. It wasn't easy for them though, for he was strong and determined. Yosho kicked and screamed at the ones who would dare hold him back. "Let me go! He must be stopped!" Yosho frantically around the room for someone who might help him, and he knew he had reached the jackpot when his eyes fell on Ranma. "Ranma, please help me. You know how much pain your father can cause, help me stop him from ever hurting others again."<p>Ranma was shocked, here was a man that he had considered calm and collected asking him to help kill his father. Ranma shook his head, "No Yosho. I don't know what the old panda did to make you want to kill him, but I won't help you. Despite what he has put me through, he is still my father and he's the only one I got. So I'm not going to let you kill him."<p>Upon hearing Ranma's refusal, Yosho ceased all struggling and almost collapsed in on himself. Seeing that he would no longer be uncooperative the guards sat Yosho at the dinner table. The rest of the people sat around the table, curious to know why Yosho wanted to kill Genma.<p>The one person at the table who was the most addled by Yosho's actions was Azusa. In the entire time that he had known his son, Azusa had always thought of Yosho as a rock in a sea of insanity. His stability was one of the reasons that Azusa had chosen Yosho as his successor. To see such anger and aggression coming from Yosho just blew Azusa away.<p>Ranma, who had just returned from calling Ukyo, sat next to Mihoshi and looked at Yosho. "Would you like to tell me why the hell you just tried to kill my father?"<p>With his head bowed, Yosho began his tale, "It started many years ago. One day my wife and daughter were taken from this world in a horrific car crash. Among the items the authorities were able to salvage were my wife's wedding ring and a pendant that my daughter had worn since she was six. I placed these in my office next to a photograph that I had of the two so that I would never forget them. Time passed and the wounds to my heart slowly healed. It was nearing the first anniversary of their tragic death when a man and his son came to stay at my shrine. The boy was very bright and impressionable, so while I made his father work for their keep I taught the boy about honor and what it truly meant to be a man. I knew that I wouldn't have much time to change the habits that the boy's good-for- nothing father had ingrained into him, but it was my hope that something that I said might stick with the boy. And might I say, when I see you now Ranma I'm glad that my hopes were justly placed. Ranma and Genma only spent a handful of days with me when, on the anniversary of my loss, they unexpectantly left. I was in shock and despair to find that my wife's ring and my daughter's pendant disappeared at the exact same time. You two were already too far away, and I too distraught, to give chase. After that I used the governmental contacts that I had to keep tabs on you until you disappeared. As reports of your misdeeds came to me I became increasingly hateful of you. Then, when Ranma came to us and told us of what Genma had done to him, I began to realize that he couldn't be allowed to live, lest he hurt others with his selfishness." For the first time since he began talking, Yosho looked up at Genma, "Tell me Genma. How much did my family's possessions get you anyway."<p>The assembled group turned to Genma with scowls and promises of pain in their eyes. What they saw shocked those who knew the cowardly martial artist the most. Instead of sweating and desperately looking for a away out, Genma was sitting ramrod straight with his head bowed. When he raised his head the group saw sorrow, guilt, and shame shinning in Genma's eyes. "I don't remember how much I got but I now know that it was no-where near what they were worth to you." Genma did something truly extraordinary, he bowed deeply to Yosho. "I know that I can never hope to gain your forgiveness, all I ask is for you to wait until the end of the day. Then you can do to me whatever you wish."<p>Yosho hadn't expected this from a man he had considered irredeemable.  "I think that Ranma is right, I will not take your life. But a sound trashing will suffice."<p>Genma merely nodded his head in acceptance.<p>The group sat in silence for several seconds as they went over what just transpired. They then heard a knock at the door. Ranma jumped up as Kasumi started to get up, "I'll get it Kasumi."<p>"Thank you Ranma."<p>When Ranma opened the door he was tackled by Shampoo and an out of breath Ukyo.<p>"Ranchan why did you leave me like that!"<p>"Ranma marry Shampoo, yes?"<p>"Ukyo, Shampoo get off." Ranma was pleasantly surprised when they did as he asked. What he didn't know was that after what had happened at the school Shampoo and Ukyo ha decided both independently and jointly to pay closer attention to his wishes, lest they end up on the wrong end of Neko-Ranma's claws. When they got off Ranma he was able to spot Cologne standing with her cane and Happosai standing with a bucket.<p>Cologne nodded at the boy she had grown to consider family, "Ranma, it is good to see you again."<p>Happosai grinned at his heir, "Ranma m'boy! Care to offer an old man a final thrill," he asked as he waved the bucket around.<p>Ranma smiled at the old pair, "It's good to see you too, Elder." He then looked at Happi, "I wouldn't do that unless you want an armful of wet male."<p>Happosai's eyes became large and full of tears, "You got rid of my lovely Ranma-chan?"<p>Ranma shook his head, "Nope, just the water bit." Deciding to show off somewhat, Ranma raised his hand over his head and summoned a ball of Light Hawk power. He then willed energy to come out of the ball and twirl down his body. As the bluish energy passed over him Ranma willed the change and traded height and rugged muscle for shortness and generous curves. Once the change was over, Ranma recalled the energy and placed a hand on his more rounded hip and the other hand behind his head. Then in the same kind of breathless voice Washu uses to tease Tenchi and his fiancés, Ranma said to Happosai, "Is this any better?"<p>Happosai, who had been awed by the energy Ranma was using then his generous bust line, came out of his stupor when he heard the way Ranma spoke to him. Once he did, years of experience at being a pervert came to life and the old man jumped at those glorious mounds. The only words coming from his lips were, "Hatcha!"<p>Unfortunately for the pervert, he landed not in a soft bosom but in the sweet embrace of a hard wood floor. The original target for his daring leap was now standing next to Cologne and laughing.<p>From her spot next to Ranma, Cologne stood in shock. First Ranma had used an energy that she had never felt on all her three hundred years. Then being able to control his curse as easily as he breathes. And finally moving in the blink of an eye without any noticeable expenditure of energy.<p>Ranma's laughter was brought up short by Ryoko teleporting in with full battle accouterments. She looked rather perturbed when she saw that everything was fine and no one was doing battle. While floating in front of Ranma, she asked, "What the hell is going on here."<p>"Oh, I was just having some fun with my friends."<p>"Fun? Damnit we thought something was wrong when we felt you powering up." Ryoko angrily replied, she the transformed back into her regular clothes. "I gotta tell the others before Washu does something," she then pointed her sword at Ranma. "And you. Never. Do. That. Again." With each word she showed her sincerity by lightly bopping Ranma in the head with her sword. Once her message was given she teleported back inside.<p>When the floating girl disappeared that was Ukyo and Shampoo's turn to ask some questions.<p>"Ranma-honey, who was that hussy," Ukyo asked as she fingered her spatula.<p>"Yes tell Shampoo. Is too too bad to cheat on Amazon wife," replied Shampoo as her fingers twitched, ready to bring forth her weapon of justice.<p>In his mind an evil grin appeared as Ranma decided that it was now time for some payback. Nothing dangerous but all the while amusing. With an air of innocence he answered Shampoo and Ukyo's question. "Why that was just my girlfriend Ryoko. Why? Is there something wrong with that?"<p>"G-g-girlfriend?"<p>Ranma happily nodded, "Yep, there's more inside." He started to walk into the house but he stopped at the door and turned around. "Come on in I want to introduce you to them."<p>Ukyo and Shampoo looked at each other and then he now vacant front door. They looked back at each other, nodded their heads, and ran inside.<p>Right on their heels was Happosai, he had seen the beauty in the skin tight suit and he was glad. Now Ranma was saying that there was more where she came from. "Wait for me!"<p>As she stood next to her cane Cologne chuckled. She knew that Ranma and this Ryoko person had no romantic feelings for the other. It made her proud to see him manipulate those girls like he did. It is a skill that he will need when he accepts his new role. Although, Happosai's actions didn't please her she wasn't going to let him effect her.<p>Once Cologne was in the living room Ranma started making introductions. "Ukyo, Shampoo, I'd like you to meet my girlfriends Ayeka, Sasami, and Ryoko. My ladyfriends are Funaho, Misaki, and Washu."<p>At Ranma's feet Happosai stood drooling at the visions of loveliness before him. If there was one skill of Ranma's that the old lecher envied, it was his ability to attract pretty ladies.<p>Nodoka sat wide eyed, her face had a far away look and her eyes were glossed over. To her this was the second happiest day of her life. Seeing how manly her son was and envisioning all the beautiful grandchildren that she would get had left her in quite a stupor.<p>Genma didn't know what to think. In one hand he had a sense of fatherly pride that his son had attracted all those beautiful women. On the other hand there was the pledge to think about. So in rare show of intelligence Genma Saotome wisely kept his mouth shut and patted a crying Soun on the shoulder.<p>The women that Ranma had said were going out with him were blushing. At some point in the time they had known Ranma they had each briefly contemplated something with him. Even if some of them had just thought of a round between the sheets.<p>At seeing the blushes on their girlfriends and wives, Tenchi and Azusa glared at Ranma. The only reason they never said a word was they knew Ranma was playing around. Of course the fact that their silence earned them brownie points with there significant others played no part in their decision to keep quiet. Nope, none at all.<p>The Nerima fiancés were less than happy at Ranma's announcement. They announced their displeasure with a resounding, "Girlfriends!"<p>Ranma nodded his head, "Ryoko, Ayeka, and Sasami are girls and they're friends. Funaho, Misaki, and occasionally Washu are ladies and they're my friends too. Is that a problem?"<p>Akane, Shampoo, and Ukyo mentally slapped themselves on the forehead.  "Of course! This is Ranma we're talking about. The dumbest most naive man on the planet," they thought together. Ukyo and Shampoo geared up and got ready to lay another glomp onto Ranma. But they were stopped short when Ranma bent over and took the hand of the slightly depressed blonde.<p>As Mihoshi listened to what Ranma had said about her friends, she grew sad. Not because Ranma had implied that he was dating everyone. No, what truly depressed the blonde-hared detective was that Ranma hadn't included her in his list of girlfriends. "I thought I am his girlfriend," thought Mihoshi. When she felt Ranma's hand on her's she looked into his blue orbs and her heart was lightened. When Ranma gently tugged on her hand, Mihoshi heeded his silent summons and stood beside him. As he slid his hand across her back and let it come to rest on her hip, Mihoshi felt a thrill of pleasure suffice her body. With her body connected to Ranma's by a simple touch Mihoshi turned in synch with Ranma's own movement so that they were both facing a woman that she could only assume was Ranma's mother.<p>When Ranma made eye contact with his love he was happy to see her depression leave her. When she stood next to him he put his arm around her waist as easily and naturally as he breathed. This simple embrace brought Ranma more comfort and happiness than anything from his time in Nerima. He looked to his mother and said, "Mother. I'd like you to meet your future daughter-in-law and the mother of my children, Mihoshi Kuramitsu.<p>Mother and future daughter-in-law looked at each other with wide eyes. If one could look into their eyes at that moment they would see stars in Nodoka's and hearts in Mihoshi's.<p>As Nodoka stood to embrace the girl that her son had chosen she was filled with joy. Finally her son had chosen a woman to marry and if what she was seeing was true then this Mihoshi was more than willing and able to perform her wifely duties. The fact that this would break the bonds with the Tendos was little consequence. Her time spent at the house had shown her how unfit Akane was to wed her son. And despite Nabiki's feelings, Nodoka doubted that Ranma would marry her. The amount of bad came in no way close to the amount of good that Nabiki had accrued, and they both knew it. Kasumi, while very traditional and proper, was somewhat prudish and that would never due for her manly son.<p>As Mihoshi moved to embrace Ranma's mother she was filled with a joy unparalleled in her life. For starters, by introducing her as daughter-in- law Ranma was reinforcing his desire to marry her, which she had been somewhat iffy about. Then adding the part about the mother of Ranma's children brought a surge of warmth to her heart. Ever since she was little Mihoshi had wanted children, but she had placed that want on the back burner when she was with Kiyone since she hated children. Mihoshi had thought that Ranma felt the same way, but now that desire was rekindled in her.<p>As Mihoshi and Nodoka embraced, Akane, Shampoo, and Ukyo began to cry. For they knew that they had lost Ranma forever and there was nothing they could do to stop it.<p>At seeing his darling baby girl crying Soun employed the one technique he knew would work on Ranma. The Demon Head. It was Soun's hope that it would scare Ranma into following the pledge.<p>Unfortunately, for Soun, Mihoshi was in the room. Though the ghastly image frightened her, Mihoshi's first thought was of protecting Nodoka. So using her training as a Galaxy Police officer Mihoshi pulled her ever- present blaster and put three rounds into Soun's Demon Head.<p>The apparition vanished and Soun plopped down on the floor. Though unharmed, Soun was shocked that his ultimate technique was defeated by a woman with a gun.<p>With Soun seated he other occupants of the room took it as a sign to sit once again. When Akane sat down the tears that were streaming down her face refused to stop. She looked at the one that she loved above all else and asked, "Why?"<p>Ranma looked at Akane with pity and mild surprise. When he last saw her he was positive that Akane could care less whether he lived or died and now it appeared that she loved him. If that was true then he knew what kind of hell she was probably experiencing. "Akane, I'm sorry."<p>She interrupted Ranma, "I thought that you loved me?"<p>"I did. And I lied on the day of the failed wedding when I said that I had never said I love you, at Jusendo. After the wedding I tried to change and make myself more acceptable to you. But even when I never said anything at all, you would still mallet me and call me a pervert. You know what I was thinking those times when you hit me with that damned mallet? A new technique, or how to solve my problems, but mostly how I could make you happy. Eventually I realized that you must hate me, if you didn't then you would have trusted me and treated me like a human being."<p>Akane took Ranma's hands into her own. "But I do love you. I can change and be the person you want. Please, give me another chance."<p>Ranma sadly shook his head and removed his hands from Akane's. "I'm sorry, Akane but no. You had your chance and now I'm with Mihoshi."<p>At that Akane jumped up and hurled herself into her father's arms. Soun just hugged his baby daughter and tried to summon the anger to yell at Ranma for making his baby cry but it wouldn't come. The rational side of his psyche was telling Soun that Ranma was right. Even more disturbingly, it was telling him that he was partly to blame.<p>When they saw Akane run from Ranma, Shampoo and Ukyo took the opportunity to confront their love. Acting as the spokeswoman for the pair, Ukyo began to talk. "What about us Ranma? You love us still right?"<p>Seeing the desperately hopeful looks on their faces caused Ranma untold pain. "Ukyo, before I left and while I was gone I thought a lot about how I feel about you. You're a very beautiful girl and any guy would be lucky to have someone with a heart as big as yours. As I was thinking of you I tried thinking of you as a lover but I never could. When I think of you I see a good friend, a stable rock in a sea of chaos. Do you know how much it hurts to come to someone expecting a friend and all they talk about is getting into a relationship that makes you uncomfortable."<p>Ukyo looked at Ranma sadly and tried to use her final trump card. "But what about the engagement? What about my honor? How can I be a girl again if you never marry me?"<p>At hearing this Ranma's shoulders drooped. "Listen Ukyo, the only way you are going to be a Saotome is if Mother adopts you. The only love that I can give is the kind that brothers and sisters have. I'm sorry."<p>Ukyo's tears refused to stop but a smile graced her features. "You know, I thought that it would hurt more but I feel at peace." Ukyo turned to Nodoka, "I don't know if I can be a Saotome like Ranma said just yet. But I wouldn't mind getting to know you better."<p>Nodoka smiled at Ukyo, "I would wish that as well." She then extended her arms towards the crying girl. They were quickly filled with a grateful Ukyo.<p>Shampoo knew that this was her final chance. So she donned her best smile and thrust her chest as far out as she could. All in the hopes that it would attract. "Ranma you come with Amazon wife, yes?"<p>Ranma looked at Cologne sharply, "You never told her?"<p>Cologne sadly shook her head, "I could not do that to her. I am sorry."<p>Shampoo looked at the two with confusion and a growing sense of dread. "Tell Shampoo what?"<p>Ranma looked Shampoo in the eye. "Shampoo, I'm not your husband anymore. The Amazon Council dissolved the Kiss of Marriage and made me an official Amazon."<p>Shampoo looked to Cologne, "Is true?"<p>It was at that moment that Cologne felt all the weight of her three hundred years pressing down upon her. "Yes, it is true. But that is not all that the Council said. Ranma it is the Council's decision that if you so choose you may make a tribe here and be it's Patriarch. The only condition the Council made was that you must choose an Elder so that they may pass on the knowledge of the other tribe. This is so that both tribes will still be connected by a common past."<p>"Ranma no love Shampoo, why?" She was truly confused, she had done everything she knew to get Ranma. She cooked, she dressed correctly, she was unfailing in her expression of love, hell she was even a better martial artist than the other girls yet Ranma hadn't chosen her. What had she done wrong?<p>Ranma decided on taking a different track to explain how he felt. "Shampoo, how do you feel about Mousse?"<p>"Shampoo no like stupid Mousse."<p>"Why?"<p>"He try to hurt Ranma and call him mean things. He touch Shampoo in not nice places."<p>"Exactly, now how do you think I felt when the girl that was trying to kill me came here. Then she starts threatening the one I cared for. She then made that same girl forget about ever knowing me. She would jump onto me and rub me in places that I didn't want her to. She caused both me and the girl I cared for a lot of pain. Now you tell me, how am I s'posed to think about her?"<p>Like the sun shinning down on a world that had been in total darkness, understanding came to Shampoo. And like many times of great insight she didn't want it. She was just like Mousse. Everything she had done, the potions, the glompings, the fighting, all had only served to push the one she loved further from her grasp. "So Ranma hate Shampoo."<p>Ranma shook his head and smiled, "No I don't hate you. But I don't love you either."<p>"Can Shampoo still be Ranma's friend," she asked hopefully.<p>"Of course you can. But friendship is all I have to offer. I'm sorry."<p>Shampoo was happy and was going to reply but was interrupted by Akane abruptly standing.<p>The tears streaming down Akane's face quickly stopped and her sorrowful look was replaced with one of rage. "You're sorry? You haven't seen sorry yet you bastard. You have fun with you little floozy while she lasts Ranma. Because one day she'll be gone and you will _beg_ me to take your sorry ass back." With that declaration Akane ran out of the house so that no one could see the true depths of her sorrow.<p>Ranma was shocked at the rage and malice Akane's words carried. Though momentarily stunned, Ranma quickly gave chase in the hopes that he could calm the raging maelstrom of emotions that was Akane.<p>When Ranma exited the front gate he was immediately treated to an odd sight. Before him stood a women in what looked like a modified sailor fuku. Her hair was frazzled and a crazed expression adorned her features. What concerned Ranma the most was the odd staff she was carrying. The way the red orb at the end of the staff facing him did not bring a sense of tranquillity and non-aggression.<p>"Ranma Saotome! Die! DEAD SCREAM!"<p>*********<p>Authors Notes: And now concludes another chapter of my humble story. Please excuse the lateness of this chapter, certain things happened that made writing exceedingly difficult. First there was college finals so I had to study for those. For those interested I made the college president's list, a fact that I am most proud off. The next problem came in the form of Christmas. You see, for me the month of December is sacrosanct. If I'm not putting up lights I'm buying presents, baking 90% of my family's Christmas treats(Yes, some men like to bake), or dealing with a monstrous head cold (The effects of which are still making themselves known. The final problem dealt with my story directly. No, I wasn't struck down with writer's block. I was struck by something much worse, boredom. I had been turning out chapters pretty regularly and the story was beginnings to become a chore, and not a welcome relief from the tedium of life. So, to preserve my sanity and ensure that this piece of fiction would not become like the multitude of stories out there, unfinished. But now I'm back refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of this story.<p>Now some may ask, why I am including Sailor Moon in a perfectly good Ranma Tenchi cross. The answer is, groundwork. The Sailor presence in this story sets the stage for the second book in which they will play a more prominent role. The way things are looking I should be back on the one chapter per month schedule that I had previously kept. In fact, once I finish writing these authors notes I will be starting on Chapter 6.<p>Feel free to ask any questions you may have. Praise is always welcome.<p>Chaos Lord King of the Wicker People
