</div>The Light Hawk War<p>By: Chaos Lord<p>Disclaimer: The characters in this story belong to their respective owners.  The concepts dealing with the Time Gates the Ultimate Good and Evil and the Forbidden belong to PacMan.<p>********<p>Chapter 4<p>********<p>"Hello Ranma, I am Tsunami."<p>Ranma was shocked and in awe. Tsunami, she said that she was Tsunami, and this place, now that I think about it, looks exactly as Tenchi described. "Um, hi. I take it you're the reason I'm here."<p>Tsunami nodded her head, "Yes, I am. I brought you here because you were finally able to receive my gift to you."<p>Ranma was confused, why would one of the most powerful beings in the universe want to give him a gift. "You didn't have to go to the trouble of getting me anything, I've already got everything I need."<p>Tsunami smiled at that, "It was no trouble since you already have the gift. All I have to do is activate it like I did Tenchi's."<p>Ranma was shocked, he knew what gift of Tenchi's that Tsunami activated and was amazed that she would do the same for him. "You mean you are going to allow me to use The Light Hawk Wings, but why, there isn't anything wrong is there."<p>"At this moment I can not tell you the reason that I bestow upon you this gift. Suffice it to say, the reason is valid and important." At that she started walking across the water and towards Ranma. She stopped only a few inches away from Ranma and placed her hands onto his shoulders. She stood there for a few moments so as to prepare herself for activating Ranma's power. When she was ready she placed her forehead against Ranma's and the runes on her forehead began to glow. In response to this, two long, thin triangular runes appeared on Ranma's forehead and they too glowed. After several seconds, Tsunami pulled away and the glowing stopped, but the runes that had appeared on Ranma's forehead remained, a testament to Ranma's power. "There, now you have the ability to use the power of the wings whenever you choose, but know this, your power will never be as great as Tenchi's, since your power did not come naturally."<p>Ranma quickly rubbed his forehead where his runes were at, then asked Tsunami, "Thanks for doing this, but I was wondering if you could tell me how to use them, because I think you forgot to tell Tenchi."<p>"Due to rules that I can not go into, I could not tell Tenchi how to use his gift, but since you exist outside the purview of those rules I may tell you and you can, in turn, tell Tenchi."<p>Ranma was a little confused about the rules bit, but as long as she would tell him how to use the wings he was happy. "Thanks, that would be a real help."<p>"The first thing you need to know is that for one to use the power of the wings one must be calm, both mentally and spiritually. That is the reason that Tenchi has only been able to use them in life or death situations. It is only then that his spiritual worries about Ryoko and Ayeka coincide with his mental worries about them. So if he is to ever use the wing's power outside of life or death situations he must go to Ayeka and Ryoko and tell them how he feels. You on the other hand will never be able to use the wings without help."<p>Ranma was flabbergasted, "She gives me the power only to tell me that I will never be able to use it, why." "Why Tsunami, why can I never use my power?"<p>"Ranma, if I were to send you back right now, you would never be able to us your power, because no matter how calm your mind may be you still have a fear buried deep in your soul. Your fear of cats and the personality that appears when you are in prolonged contact with one prevent you from using the wing's power. As you are now the only benefit the wing's power gives you is your curse."<p>Ranma looked at her in confusion, "What do you mean? It didn't get rid of it did it?"<p>Tsunami shook her head, "No, when I activated your power it merely changed your curse's trigger."<p>"What do you mean by trigger?"<p>"The curse you received at Jusenkyo was in fact two curses. The first curse is the obvious one, the curse that changes you gender. The second is one that you might not have thought of, a water attracting curse, or more specifically, a cold water attracting curse. Now the first curse was linked to the second by a trigger, this had the effect of causing you to become a woman when splashed with cold water. When I activated your light hawk power I was able to change what the trigger is linked to. Now you will only change genders when you want to, since I linked the trigger to your will. All you have to do is think about your female form and will yourself into it. You should probably try it now to see it work."<p>Ranma was ecstatic, the one thing about his curse that he hated she had fixed for him. So he followed Tsunami's instructions on how to shift into his cursed form. In his mind's eye he conjured up an image of his female form and when he felt he had it solid enough he imagined his soul entering that other shell and bringing it to life. As soon as he completed that thought he felt the tingling and subtle shifting that heralded his curse. When the change was finished with him, he looked down and spotted the large breasts that he had become used to while he was in this form. And then he realized that something was off, it only took him a few seconds to figure out that along with his body his clothes had changed as well, including proper under garments. "Ack"<p>Tsunami's happy tone became one of worry when she heard Ranma's shocked outburst, "What is wrong?"<p>Ranma was slightly embarrassed to tell her about his change in apparel , but he figured that if this would happen every time he changed, he might as well know now. "Um, Tsunami, are my clothes always going to change when I do?"<p>Tsunami breathed a sigh of relief. She had thought that she had messed up and changed his other form. She had never thought about Ranma's clothes when she told him to change. "I am sorry Ranma. I forgot to mention that since this place is not entirely real it changes clothes to fit the wearer's gender. It has not been an issue before since those that have been called to this place only had one gender. To ease your fears, no that will not happen in everyday life, but it will happen if you change genders while in your Light Hawk armor. Now we have other matters to discuss, namely your using your Light Hawk Wings."<p>Ranma nodded his head, "Yeah, you said that I can't use them because of my fear of cats."<p>"That's right, but I can help you overcome this problem." She then waved her arm and a black vortex appeared. With her arm towards Ranma she said, "Ranma, take my hand and let us begin your journey of healing."<p>Ranma took Tsunami's hand with trepidation. They were about to face his deepest, darkest fear and that scared him a bit. As Tsunami and Ranma entered the portal, the only thought on Ranma's mind was, "I hope this works."<p>*********<p>When Ranma exited the portal he found himself in a barren wasteland. As the cold wind blew against Ranma he saw a dark and foreboding storm cloud off in the distance. The storm was so violent that he could see the fierce lightning from where he stood. As he continued his survey of the land, the only sign of civilization he could see was a road that made its way towards the storm. After completing his survey, he turned to Tsunami, "Where are we, and why am I a guy?"<p>Tsunami, who had also been taking a look around, turned to Ranma to answer his question. "We are in your soul," she said sadly.<p>Ranma was in shock, "My soul? This, is my soul? This barren wasteland is my soul. Why?" Ranma knew that he had done some bad things in his life but he didn't think that they would cause his soul to look like this. He doubted that even Happosai, despite all his evil deeds, would have a soul that would look like this. He was broken out of any further thought by a hand on his shoulder. He turned his head and looked at Tsunami.<p>"Ranma this is merely a portion of your soul. It all of it looked like this I would have never allowed you access to the Light Hawk Wings. We are now on the outskirts of the part of you that the Neko-ken resides. And this is as far as can go, the rest of this journey is for you to go on alone. Before you continue there is something that I must give you. Hold out your hand."<p>Ranma did as she commanded and Tsunami placed two seeds into his hand. He looked at the seeds and then back at Tsunami. "What are these for?"<p>"Those seeds are yours and Tenchi's space trees. Take them to Washu and ask for her help in planting them."<p>"Why do Tenchi and I need trees?"<p>"They will allow you to use your conventional powers without risk of death or serious injury. Also one final request before you start your journey, please tell Washu that I have given my blessing to Yosho's tree and it may be removed safely."<p>Ranma nodded his head and placed the seeds into his pockets. "I'll tell her, and Tsunami, thanks." With that he began to run towards the storm and the Neko-Ken.<p>Tsunami stood there for several moments and watched as Ranma ran towards the storm. "You're welcome. Good luck, Ranma, I pray that you will need it before this is over." Her body began to glow and he vanished.<p>*********<p>As Ranma ran towards the source of his fears his only companion was the wind that was blowing in his face. Step after step, he ran for what seemed like hours, as he neared the storm the winds only increased, while at the same time the temperature steadily decreased. Eventually his run slowed to a jog, then to a walk, then he was finally forced to crawl his way towards the storm. He was crawling for two reasons, the first was that the wind was so strong that he couldn't stand and the second reason was that the wind had gotten so cold that spears of ice were being hurled at him. Crawling was the only way he could protect his face. The howl of the wind had gotten so loud that he was unable to think.<p>Some time later he reached the storm, this was both good and bad. It was good because the wind died down enough to allow Ranma walk. Reaching the storm was bad because he had to watch for lightning. As long as he stayed on the path he was fine, the only problem was that the path was only a foot and a half wide and the lightning was crashing down at the very edge of the path. As a bolt of lightning came down Ranma had to be careful not to jump away because if he did he would receive ten thousand volts for his trouble.<p>He continued this way for another two hours until he exited the storm and came across a small area that was storm free. The ground there was covered with thick vibrantly green grass. In the exact center of this zone of calmness was a house. It was nowhere near as large the Tendo home, it probably had only three rooms, and that was a generous guess on Ranma's part. The house had something that the Tendo home never had, a palatable sense of calmness.<p>As Ranma walked to the front door he noticed a statue of a cat on either side of the door. The cats disturbed Ranma greatly, not because of their feline origin but because that they didn't trigger any cat-related response in him. Deciding not to dwell on the statues he raised his arm to knock on the door.<p>But before he could strike the wooden door a male voice came from within the dwelling, "Come in before you catch a cold."<p>Ranma did as the man said, because although it was clear and sunny outside there was still a chill in the air and his clothes were soaked due to the ice from the storm. "At least I'm still a guy. I wish she had told me why I was a guy again though."<p>"You are a male because we are in your soul," answered the large man just inside the room, "and you are getting my floor wet." At that he handed Ranma the towel that he was holding. "You should change into some drier clothes," he pointed at a small table that had some folded clothes laying on it. "Take those and put them on, I shall put them over the fire to dry."<p>Ranma quickly got out of his wet clothes and put on the simple work clothes that his host had offered him. After he was dressed he sat at the table and looked at his surroundings. The room was small but well insulated so that the fireplace in the corner kept the room nice and toasty. On one wall there was a bookcase filled with ancient looking books, some were leather bound and others were kept together with leather straps. Several minutes after Ranma sat down his host came in with a tray that had teacups and a rough-hewn kettle on it.<p>The man sat down and began to serve them the tea. As the man served them, Ranma had the chance really take a look at him. He was wearing work clothes similar to the ones that Ranma was now wearing, though they sat differently on his large and muscular frame. His black hair was long and pulled back in a tight ponytail. His ears came to points and they seemed longer than a normal person's. His face was worn, but kind speaking of countless years of outdoor work. Yet despite this, his face was kind. His eyes showed a man far older than his body would say, the fact that his iris and pupils were shaped like Ryoko's were. That is to say, that they were very cat-like in appearance.<p>After the man finished serving the tea Ranma asked the question that had plagued him since he first laid eyes on him. "Um mister, can you tell me who you are and why you are in my soul?"<p>After taking a sip of his tea, the man sat his cup back on the table and shook his head. "Tsk, tsk, Ranma didn't anyone ever manners. Why where I come from names have power, so why should I tell you mine. If I did you would have an advantage over me."<p>Ranma shook his head in return, "Well, where I come from it is polite to give your name to the person you are talking to. Besides, you are the one with the advantage, you know who I am but I still don't know who you are. So I ask again, who are you and what are you doing in my soul?" Ranma had to mentally pat himself on the back, all that verbal sparing that he had with Nabiki and Washu has been rubbing off on him.<p>After hearing Ranma's counter to his evasion the man let loose with a loud boisterous laugh. "I knew there was a reason that I liked you, and you're right, I do have an unfair advantage over you, so I shall put us on equal terms. Ranma Saotome, my name is Nergal, it is a pleasure to finally meet you. To answer the second part of your query, the reason that I am residing in your soul is that your father put me here."<p>When Ranma heard that Genma was the reason he had some guy living in his soul he became, shall we say, less than happy. "Damnit Pops, first you sell my body, then you sell space in my soul. What did you get for it, two fish sticks?"<p>"Ranma, Ranma, there is no reason to blame your father for anything more than teaching you that false version of the Neko-Ken."<p>That brought Ranma's mind to a screeching halt. "False Neko-Ken? If the style that I know isn't the "true" Neko-Ken I would hate to see the training for that. And why is the Neko-Ken be responsible for you living in my soul?"<p>"Well the reason that I am here is that I am in all who are trained in the Neko-Ken. For you see, I am the one that created the style."<p>"YOU, you created that that twisted technique, why? You like to torture kids or. . SMACK" Ranma put his hand up to soothe his now aching jaw.<p>"Never, ever associate me and my technique with that god forsaken, bastardized copy. The Neko-Ken I underwent and then perfected is a joyous experience for both the trainee and the cat. Perhaps I should give you an explanation on who I am and what the TRUE Neko-Ken is.<p>Nine thousand years ago I was a farmer living in the world after a time we knew as The Silver Millennium. When I was alive magic was still a part of this world and a class system became based on the ability to use magic. My wife, daughter, and I could not use magic, so we were farmers. We were able to grow our food and live in peace for a few years until a noble man came to live in our area. He demanded that we give him half our annual crop and my beautiful wife whenever he wanted her. We refused, of course, half of our food would have left us starving and no-one but me was going to touch my wife in that manner. I was so angry at his proposal I knocked him off his horse and into the mud. He told his men not to retaliate against me and he left, even now I wish he would have et them beat me up, maybe then, what came after might not have come to pass. Several days later I came home after hunting in some nearby woods, when I reached the house I was horrified. The house, that my wife and I spent so much time and effort into building, was burnt to the ground. My wife and daughter were lying on the ground, their naked forms were riddled with bruises and cuts. The only living thing in the area other than my self was my daughter's kitten. It was beaten as if it had tried to protect my daughter and was thrown to the side. So I buried my family and left with the kitten. For years after that I looked for a way to get my revenge against the sorcerer that killed my family. During that time I kept the cat alive but it would always be a little slow, I never minded though, it was the only link that I had with my family. Several years later the cat died from a snakebite, when that happened I held the cat and cried long and hard. Then to my amazement, the cat began to glow a bright white, the glow then condensed into a ball. The ball then flew into me and I felt such rapture. I saw my cat's life from beginning to end, I saw how my family was brutalized and I saw all the adventures that I had with the cat. The cat's soul had merged with mine and we both knew the joy of knowing that our family would always be with us. The merging of our souls had some interesting side effects, my senses were all greatly amplified, as were all my physical abilities, such as my reflexes. Also the merging gave me access to a new power, a power that is stronger than Ki or Chi, stronger even than magic. With this power I was able to shred trees easier than I could break a twig. Seeing the power at my disposal I went back to my homeland and exacted my revenge. His attacks and defenses were nothing against my power and when that monster died I vowed to travel the world and protect those who could not protect themselves. So that is was what I did for a great many years after that. During that time I found others that shared my beliefs and I taught these few what would one day be known as the Neko-Ken. The power that my disciples and I possessed scared many men and even the gods themselves are leery of our power. The Babylonians, after hearing of my power named their god of war after me. Eventually I died but my disciples carried out my work, and even though I was dead my spirit lived on in the souls of all who have learned the technique and have the power. Sometime after I died those who feared our power came up with the perverted version that you were subjected to. It was their hope that no one would want to earn a technique that involved what they had created. Unfortunately they were correct and my version has all but disappeared from this world. Then you came along. You have the skill, the heart, and the strength of will to carry on the true technique."<p>The story that Nergal told amazed Ranma. To have his entire family brutally murdered and then still have the will to live on AND protect the innocent was amazing. "I have two questions. The first question is, what is the name of the power that you found. And my second question is, how can I learn and carry on your school if I can't be around cats without freaking out?"<p>Nergal stood and headed towards the back of the house, "Come with me."<p>Ranma did as Nergal commanded and followed him. After leaving the room that they were in Ranma found himself in a small kitchen. A wood stove stood in a corner and the sink had a hand pump attached to it. At the back of the room there was a door to the back. Outside there was a small shrine like the ones that Ranma had seen during his travels.<p>Nergal opened the shrine and Ranma could see a bright light emanating from within. "I never really named the power that we use because I couldn't think of one. The name that I usually use, power, is a good description of what we use because it is power. What I can give you is an explanation on where the power comes from, it comes from the limitless potential of the human spirit. When a human soul merges with a cat soul, the cat soul allows the human to tap into that limitless potential."<p>"So is that bright light my power?"<p>Nergal sadly shook his head, "No, this is the result of the Neko-Ken training that you underwent. Normally this shrine would contain a single light no brighter than a candle's flame. The version of the Neko-Ken you learn merges not one cat soul to a human soul but many cat souls to only one human soul. This caused your soul to become confused and allowed your cat personality to be created."<p>Ranma wasn't completely sure what everything Nergal said meant but he did hear that there was a problem. "So how do we fix it?"<p>"You must make a choice," Nergal then reached into the shrine and pulled out three glowing balls. "Ranma, each of these lights is a cat soul. You must decide which will become one with you and which others that will move on."<p>Ranma looked at the three glowing orbs and then back to Nergal, "Choose? How?"<p>"They have each agreed to merge with you. No matter how you choose the results will be the same. Only the memories that you shall receive will be different."<p>Ranma looked at the three balls and picked the one to the farthest right. He pointed at the ball and said, "I'll take that one."<p>The two balls that Ranma didn't choose flew off and disappeared. Nergal's gaze followed the light, "At last they are at peace." He then shifted his gaze to Ranma, "Prepare yourself."<p>Ranma stood to his full height, "Ready." The ball that remained in front of Nergal began to glow brighter and then it slammed into Ranma's chest. When the ball entered Ranma he felt happier than he had ever felt before. He watched the cat's entire life, from being born and raised in a street alley to living on the streets. Then one day being found by a large dirty man and tossed into a hole. After that, days of no food followed by the man tossing a boy into the pit, a need for food that was so great it attacked the child to get at the food that was attached to it. The next few times the child was thrown in, watching to see what was going on. The final time that the child was thrown in it watch as one of the other cats savagely attacked the boy until he was close to death. Knowing that he had to help the child who was treated so wrongly by the dirty man. The feeling of peace as his body changed, and then confusion as he entered the boy. The battle for dominance for the next few years, and then finally the cat man ending the fight and giving the boy the choice.<p>When the flood of images finally abated Ranma felt the new power that Nergal described. Though he could only see a small portion of this energy, Ranma knew he had only scratched the surface of it. When he opened his eyes and looked at Nergal the only thing he could say was, "Wow."<p>Nergal nodded his head, "Indeed," and with that he shoved Ranma backwards. As Ranma fell away from him he said, "Good luck young cub, and safe journey." When he finished saying those words Ranma fell through the ground, the only sign he had been there was a slight ripple in the ground. Nergal watched the ground ripple until it stopped, when it did he turned and looked at the shrine which had a small glowing ball in it. "Good luck Ranma," and with that he closed the shrine and headed back inside. On his way back he only stopped once to take in the beauty that replaced the storm and wasteland.<p>*********<p>From beneath the space tree Funaho Ranma Saotome awoke. As he sat up he was amazed at how much more acute his senses were. The whole area was alive around him, he turned his head to see what was causing some commotion in the bushes only to find that the bushes that were making the noise were over two hundred feet away. He let out a loud whoop and made a b-line to the house to inform everyone about the good news, the fear and uneasiness were gone. Ever since he went through the Neko-Ken training Ranma had been unable to think about cats without being uneasy. As he ran towards the house he had a hard time controlling himself, he was so full of energy he thought that he would burst. When he reached the house he saw Sasami sitting out front, he ran over to her and picked her up. As he spun her around he also hugged her. When Ranma stopped spinning Sasami he stood her in front of him and whispered, "Thank you Sasami."<p>Sasami beamed at Ranma, "You're welcome Ranma. I guess you got control of the Neko-Ken."<p>"You bet I did, watch," with that he turned to a nearby tree stump. Once he was sure that there was no one in the line of fire, he swiped his arm in front of him and a second later the stump exploded. He nervously turned back to Sasami, "Whoops, I think I put a little too much power behind of that." He then remembered the seeds in his pocket, "Hey Sasami, is Washu in her lab? I need to talk with her."<p>"As far as I know she is in her lab."<p>"Thanks," as soon as the words left his mouth, Ranma was heading for Washu's lab. As he was running he ran past Ryoko and Ayeka who were running outside. "Sorry can't talk."<p>*********<p>Ryoko and Ayeka were in the middle of some quality make out time when they heard an explosion outside. They quickly stopped what they were doing and started rearranging their clothes, after all they wouldn't want to fight someone while their chests were on display. When their clothes were in proper order they headed outside to see what caused the explosion. As they exited the house Ranma passed them running the opposite direction.<p>"Sorry can't talk."<p>This caused Ryoko and Ayeka to slow down, when they saw Sasami standing out in front of them with a smile adorning her features they came to a complete stop. Ayeka was the first to speak, "Sasami, what was that explosion?"<p>Ryoko followed her inquiry with, "Yeah, and why was Ranma running away."<p>"Ranma was just showing me how he can now use the Neko-Ken. He accidentally used too much power and he blew up that tree stump. After that he said he needed to talk to Washu."<p>Ryoko and Ayeka were shocked, "He can use the Neko-Ken?"<p>Sasami nodded her head, "Uh huh." She then headed inside to work on some chores.<p>After Sasami went inside Ayeka turned to Ryoko, "He can use the Neko- Ken now. Does this mean that he will leave." While the possibility of Ranma did not really bother her, Ayeka would miss him. She did know that if Ranma left several others would be hurting, Sasami would be upset at him leaving.<p>Ryoko shrugged her shoulders, "Who knows. He hasn't finished training with Tenchi, so he might stay." Ryoko hoped he would stay, for Mihoshi's sake. Ryoko had watched how Mihoshi and Ranma interacted with each other and she could see the stirrings of love. On several occasions she watched as the pair practiced martial arts and she could see that some serious emotions were being traded back and forth. Some of the touches that the two exchanged looked like more than they should be.<p>"You could be right. We just have to hope that Ranma will stay with us." She then decided to change the subject and latched her arm around Ryoko's, "What do you say to a walk?"<p>Ryoko smiled at the princess, "That sounds great." So the couple took off and began walking.<p>*********<p>In her lab Washu's scanners were going haywire. They were detecting an unknown energy signature composed of both Light Hawk power and another energy that was slightly warping the first. When she heard a knock at her door her first instinct was to tell who ever the person was to go away. But when she saw that the energy signature was coming from a point two inches from her door she decided to take a look. She accessed her door's camera to see who was at her door, and when the camera showed her Ranma she was astonished. In the intervening time since the first knock a second one came, it was to this one that she replied, "Come in." When Ranma entered her lab she tried her best to look surprised.<p>"Hey Washu, is something wrong? I had to knock two times before you let me in."<p>"Sorry about that Ranma. I was tracing some spontaneously occurring energy patterns." Before she could say anything else, Ranma told her why she was detecting that energy.<p>"The energy you're seeing is probably coming from me. You see, I've got control of the Neko-Ken now and it gave me the ability to use some new energy."<p>It took all of Washu's willpower not to hit the button labeled guinea pig collector. But her curiosity could not be denied so she resorted to, "Ranma, do you mind if I examine you to learn more about that energy you use."<p>Ranma shrugged his shoulders, "As long as you don't do it right now I don't mind."<p>Washu pouted at not being able to examine Ranma, "Why can't I do it now."<p>At seeing Washu's pout Ranma almost let her do her scan. But luckily for him, Ranma remembered the seeds in his pockets. So he phrased his request in a way he knew she would respond to, "Because I have a challenge for you, if you're up to it."<p>When Washu heard the word challenge all her thoughts about Ranma's newfound power went out the window. It was a good thing that she didn't hear the bit about whether she could handle it or not, otherwise she might have done something, drastic, to Ranma. "What kind of challenge do you have for me?"<p>Ranma mentally grinned, "Good now I have her full attention." "Well I talked with Tsunami and she told me to ask you about something to plant Tenchi's and mine space trees. She also said that she gave her blessing to Funaho so we can move her. Do you think that you can pull it off."<p>Washu was on cloud nine, she was going to be the first to transplant a royal tree from a planet and into a ship after it has taken root. "Building the tree modules will be easy, I still have the plans to the one that Kagato made. So all I'll have to do is program my equipment to build three of them. Moving Funaho without damaging her will be the real challenge. Hand me the seeds and I will get to work on the problem."<p>Ranma handed her the seeds and turned to leave Washu to her challenge. As he was about to touch the doorknob Washu's voice drew his attention.<p>"Before we can plant your tree I will have to scan you to get up to date measurements to put into the habitat. Also, will you get Lord Katsuhito for me? I need to discuss the moving of Funaho with him."<p>Ranma nodded, "Sure. Do you know where Tenchi's at, I need to tell him something."<p>Washu, who was already working on her terminal, replied, "I believe he is at the shrine with Lord Katsuhito."<p>"Thanks." As Ranma left the room he could hear the machinery in the lab coming online.<p>*********<p>In an area of the galaxy far removed from Earth, amongst the wreckage of ships and structures, there floated through the void a huge golden hall.  In the center of this hall there was a room with golden pillars reaching to the heavenly ceiling. In the center of this room there were two beings.  The first being was the floating face of an old man whose forehead contained a floating red ovoid gem. The second being was a woman in flowing robes. Her purple eyes shown brightly with anger and her clawed hand twitched in response of that anger.<p>The place was the temple to the goddess Tokimi, the floating face was the goddess' high priest D3, and the woman was the sister of Tsunami, the goddess Tokimi.<p>Tokimi's ire knew no bounds, "Blast you Tsunami, how dare you give Him the power of the wings." If there was one being in this universe that Tokimi truly hated it was Ranma Saotome and now he had the power of the Light Hawk Wings. When Tokimi came to this universe she looked to find any group that could challenge her plan, she found the Kingdom of the Moon. While by themselves the Kingdom of the Moon and it's leaders the Serenitys could pose no threat to her awesome power, Tokimi knew that if they were ever to meet Tsunami's people that it would be disastrous for her. She had watched The Kingdom of the Moon for centuries, manipulating them into not leave their pathetic star system. But eventually she came to the conclusion that her efforts were not enough, yes she could watch space to determine whether the two ever met. Ever since they had come to this universe there was one part of the cosmos closed to her, Time. She, like the paltry mortals of this realm, was stuck living a linear existence. And the brothers would never allow her to openly harm the system since they had claimed it for their "Test".<p>So for countless years she despaired in the knowledge that she may not be prepared for the coming attack. That was until the fools on the Kingdom of the Moon's outermost planet discovered an artifact with the power to pierce the barrier of time. She had tried in many different ways to gain control of the laughably named Time Gate but the gate, and the gate's guardian, that damnable Sailor Pluto, had defenses too strong to succumb to her machinations. Then a most joyous event occurred, a being calling herself Metallia, The Dark God, was able to destroy the Kingdom of the Moon, and since one of their own people freed the self-styled god, The Brothers were powerless to stop the destruction. With the Kingdom of the Moon cast into the void, the defenses of the Gate's mistress were low enough for Tokimi to enter and manipulate her mind.<p>Now that Tokimi could use the Time Gate she scanned ahead and found that some of the royalty would be resurrected. She also found that a group of Tsunami's people would live on the Earth but that they would never come in contact with the remnants of the Kingdom of the Moon. As the years crept on Tokimi would periodically check to see if her plans were still on the correct track, and for a long time they were. Then, on one check, an obstacle appeared, a man that would, through blind luck and mishap, unite the Kingdom of the Moon with Tsunami's people and lead them against her. So she tried every thing that she could think of to be rid of him, and now Tsunami has given him Light Hawk Wings.<p>"You have gone too far this time dear sister, and now I will show you the error of your ways. Zander, come here this instant!"<p>On a golden pedestal in front of Tokimi a man appeared. He wore heavy black combat boots and his black cargo pants were tucked into them. His crimson shirt was stretched tight across his muscular torso and a dark gray jacket covered his arms. The man's skin was pale white and his face was beautiful yet horribly cruel, the kind of face that says, "I like to bathe in he blood of my enemies." His dark green hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, and two black triangles burned on his forehead. He went down on one knee and lowered his head. "You summoned me Lady Tokimi."<p>"Yes, I did. Go and prepare your self for battle. We must teach my sister a lesson."<p>Zander stood, a cruel smirk adorned his features, "As you will it my lady." With that he teleported away.<p>"Ah Tsunami, you shall soon learn to never cross Tokimi." Tokimi then disappeared and shortly thereafter her chapel disappeared as well.<p>*********<p>Outside the Masaki shrine Tenchi was cleaning the walk. As he was scrubbing the stones a pair of black slippered feet appeared in front of him. He sat back to see who it was and saw that it was Ranma, "Hey Ranma. What's up?"<p>"I need to talk to the old man. Do you know where he is?<p>Tenchi nodded his head and gestured to the shrine behind him. "He's in the shrine office."<p>Ranma smiled, "Thanks Tenchi. I need to talk to you to so stay here."<p>Tenchi shrugged his shoulders, "Well these stones and I aren't going anywhere."<p>"Great." With that Ranma headed to where Katsuhito was at. When Ranma entered the office he saw that Katsuhito sitting at the table drinking some tea.<p>"'Ah Ranma, back from your talk with Tsunami already, heh."<p>"Damn! How does he always do that," thought Ranma. "How did you. "<p>"Know? Well that is simple, Funaho told me." Katsuhito smirked at one-upping someone once again. "So what do you wish to speak with me about?"<p>"Washu told me to come get you, she needs your help moving Funaho."<p>Katsuhito was appalled and he jumped to a standing position, "Doesn't Washu know that she will kill Funaho if she moves her?"<p>"Not right now it won't, Tsunami told me that we can move her safety."<p>Katsuhito was happy, the one thing that he regretted about allowing Tenchi to release Ryoko was that one day Tenchi would give her all of the gems in the Master Key. While he didn't mind growing old, he didn't want his tree to suffer because of it. "This is definitely good news. I will go talk to Washu. That is if you have nothing else to tell me?"<p>Ranma shook his head, "Nope, I got nothing else to say."<p>Since Ranma didn't have anything to tell him Katsuhito left the office in a dead run. He wanted to make sure that his friend had the best possible care.<p>Ranma followed Katsuhito out of the shrine at a much more sedate pace. When he got outside he saw Tenchi standing with a bewildered expression on his face, "Hey Tenchi, what are you doing?"<p>"Ranma, grandpa just ran past, is there something wrong."<p>Ranma shook his head and waved aside Tenchi's concern. "Na, I just told him Washu needed to talk to him and he got excited on his own."<p>"Oh, ok," Tenchi pondered on that for a few seconds. He then remembered that Ranma said he wanted to tell him something. "You wanted to talk to me?"<p>"You're right, I do, watch this." Ranma put his right arm out in front of him with his palm facing Tenchi. Ranma looked inside himself to the place where his Light Hawk power resides. When he found what he was looking for, Ranma touched the power and called it forth. In response to his call the runes that adorned his forehead in Tsunami's realm reappeared and a glowing blue Light Hawk Wing came to existence in front of his hand.<p>When Tenchi saw the runes and wing appear he was in shock. He had tried everything he could think of for a year to try and make his own wings appear. And here Ranma does it in two months and he makes it look as easy as lifting your arm. "How?"<p>Ranma dropped his arm and let the wing disappear but he still held onto the power. "Easy, Tsunami told me how. "<p>Tenchi was confused, she told Ranma how to use them outside of danger and yet she didn't tell him. "Then why didn't she tell me?"<p>Ranma shrugged his shoulders, "She said something about telling you was against the rules."<p>"So does that mean you can't tell me either."<p>"Now I didn't say that. She just said she couldn't tell you, there's nothing wrong with me telling you."<p>Tenchi was excited, he was finally going to use those wings in time other than life or death situations. "Well don't just stand there, spit it out man."<p>"She said that use the wing's power you need to have both a calm mind and soul. For me that meant that I needed to get rid of my fear of cats. You need to tell Ryoko and Ayeka how you feel about them."<p>Tenchi's heart grew cold. "Oh god, not that, anything but that," he though in despair. "Well thanks for telling me how to use the wings Ranma but I guess I'll never be able to use them."<p>"Why not," asked Ranma. He could see how much they love each other so why wouldn't he tell them his feelings. Which was a pretty ironic observation coming from Ranma, since he was incapable of seeing his own predicament.<p>"I can't tell them that I love and need them both, it'll destroy them. They are just now getting nice to each other, they would never go for a three way relationship."<p>Ranma placed his hand on Tenchi's shoulder, "Tell them. You might surprised with what they say." With that he headed off to find Mihoshi and tell her the good news.<p>"Tell them he says. This coming from the guy with three fiancés. But if it is the only way I can protect even one of them then I've got to tell them. I just hope they don't hate me for doing this to them." With his course decided, Tenchi headed towards the house like a man about to be executed. As he walked down the long stairs to his home, Tenchi reflected on his two loves and hoped that memories would not be the only thing that he would have of them when this was over.<p>Ten minutes after starting his walk down the shrine steps he reached the front door of his home. He stood there for a few moments to steel himself for the coming discussion. When he felt that he was as ready as he could be, Tenchi slid open the door and walked inside. When Tenchi entered the living room his heart dropped, Ryoko and Ayeka were sitting far apart from each other on the couch. Their clothes and hair were disheveled, their faces were flushed, and they were breathing hard. The only conclusion that Tenchi could draw from this was that they had been fighting and it made what he was about to tell them that much harder. He sat on the couch opposite from the one the girls were sitting on, "Ryoko, Ayeka, there is something that I have to tell you. But because of what you were just doing I don't know how you're going to take it."<p>Ryoko looked shocked and embarrassed, "You know what we were doing."<p>Tenchi sighed, "Of course I know, I'm not blind you know. And seeing you like this," he gestured to there disheveled appearance, "makes what I have to say hurt even more."<p>"If what you have to say hurts you, you don't have to tell us," replied a suddenly pale Ayeka.<p>Tenchi weakly smiled at her, "Thanks Ayeka, but I got to say this." Tenchi inhaled deeply, "Ryoko, Ayeka, I love you both very much. I know you . . " Tenchi couldn't finish because he was tackled by two crying women.<p>*********<p>When Ryoko heard Tenchi coming in the house she quickly disentangled herself from Ayeka and tried to get her clothes in some semblance of order.  As she did this she mouthed, "Tenchi," to Ayeka who also rushed to get her clothes in order. Right before Tenchi came in to the room Ryoko was sitting on the opposite side of the couch from Ayeka. As Tenchi sat across from them Ryoko could tell that he was depressed about something. When he started to talk Ryoko got worried and when he revealed that he knew what they were it doing shocked her. "You know what we were doing."<p>"Of course I know, I'm not blind you know. And seeing you like this makes what I have to say hurt even more."<p>At hearing that Ryoko's worry turned to fear, "He doesn't approve of us!" While she was upset at this fact, what terrified her was how would Ayeka react to this news. In her terror she was bombarded by visions of Ayeka dumping her to go marry Tenchi and moving to Jurai. Her fears were only confirmed when Ryoko saw Ayeka's pale expression. Ryoko's terror was so great that she didn't even hear what Ayeka said though she was looking right at her. She was brought back to the conversation at hand when Tenchi said her name.<p>"Ryoko, Ayeka, I love you both very much." When Ryoko heard those words that she had longed to hear from her love, she was ecstatic. He loved her!  And Ayeka too! Ryoko was so happy that the only thing she could do to express this feeling was to tackle Tenchi. As she was hugging him she felt someone else also hugging him. So she turned her head and saw that Ayeka was also hugging Tenchi, the smile that graced her features was just as manic as Ryoko's.<p>*********<p>Ayeka was happy at the moment, Ryoko was kissing her passionately and the way Ryoko tweaked her nipple set chills down her spine. But when Ryoko abruptly detached herself from her Ayeka's pleasure became confusion and slight annoyance at having Ryoko stop what she was doing. When she looked up at Ryoko to see why she stopped what they were doing.<p>Ryoko mouthed, "Tenchi"<p>When Ayeka saw that she was thrown into a panic. Tenchi! He wasn't supposed to be back yet. Deciding that it is a mute point since he was here now, Ayeka jumped up and began to straighten out her clothes as well. She was back on the couch panting, both from their prior "activities" and the rushed dressing, by the time Tenchi entered the room. When she heard that he knew what Ryoko and her were doing she grew afraid. She knew that he was going to tell them that he didn't like them. For a split second, the small part of her that was still mired in royal politics said, "Dump Ryoko! Then Tenchi will love you." But the rest of her quashed that thought and in her shame she couldn't look at Ryoko and give her a sign of her continuing love. When Tenchi said that what he had to say was hurting him Ayeka tried to stop him before he could crush her and Ryoko. "If what you have to say hurts you, you don't have to tell us." But her efforts had no effect on the inevitable conclusion of their little soap opera.<p>"Thanks Ayeka, but I got to say this. Ryoko, Ayeka, I love you both very much."<p>When Ayeka heard those three little words from her beloved her heart soared. And when she heard that he also loved Ryoko her soaring heart went straight into warp drive. "Now we can be a family," thought Ayeka. She then decided to throw decorum and manners out the window and she took a page out of Ryoko's book, she tackled Tenchi.<p>*********<p>As Tenchi lay there being held by the women he loves the only thought on his mind was, "Huh." He could understand the crying bit but why were they smiling and kissing him? "Ryoko, Ayeka, why are you so happy? I said that I love both of you."<p>Ryoko pulled away a little bit so she could talk to Tenchi. "We know, now we can be together," she was so happy that she was almost singing what she said.<p>"Together? I don't understand. I thought the two of you hated each other?" Tenchi was very confused, first they were fighting and now they WANT to be together?<p>Ayeka took this part of the conversation. "At first we did. But over time Ryoko and I started developing feelings for each other. Ryoko confronted me about this and got me to admit to loving her in addition to the love that I feel for you. Since then we have been a couple while waiting for you to come to your senses and tell us what you just did."<p>Tenchi was even more confused. They love me AND each other. "If you love each other then why were you two fighting."<p>Now it was Ryoko and Ayeka's turn to look confused. They each racked their brains to figure out what he was talking about. When they couldn't figure it out on their own they looked to the other to see if maybe she had come up with something. Seeing that neither had a clue about what Tenchi was talking about they faced him, and at the same time said, "What?"<p>Tenchi sighed, "You were fighting before I came in here. It's nice of you to try to cover it up, but your messed up clothes says that you were fighting."<p>At that Ayeka and Ryoko started to laugh. When Ryoko saw that Tenchi wasn't laughing she calmed down a little to explain to him why their clothes were messed up. "Tenchi, we weren't fighting, we were making out. That's why we're laughing."<p>"Making out! Really?" At seeing their nod Tenchi said, "Well I feel stupid." He then asked something completely out of character for him, "Can I join in?"<p>For a few seconds Ryoko and Ayeka were shocked at Tenchi's request. But soon there shocked expressions gave way to sly grins.<p>"Well I don't know. What do you think Ayeka."<p>"I agree it is a difficult decision, perhaps we should go and think about it."<p>Ryoko nodded sagely, "Yes lets." With that Ryoko and Ayeka jumped off Tenchi and ran away all the while giggling like maniacs.<p>Tenchi lay there for several seconds and pondered what just went on. He then jumped up and said, "Hey wait for me!"<p>*********<p>Whap! A branch hit Ranma in the face. "Ow! Damn that hurt," he grumbled as he rubbed his nose. "Why's she so far out here?" Ranma had looked everywhere for Mihoshi, he had even tried Yukinojo but she wasn't there either. Since he couldn't find her by regular means, Ranma tried his newly expanded senses. When he did that he was able to pick up a faint trace of her from the other side of the lake. He headed that way to see if she was ok and to tell her about gaining mastery of the Neko-Ken.<p>When Ranma found her she was kneeling in a small clearing. In front of Mihoshi sat a small shrine with some incense burning in it. Not wanting to disturb her, and yet unwilling to leave, Ranma silently waited for Mihoshi to finish what she was doing.<p>After several minutes Mihoshi touched her head to the ground, as she came back up she blew out the incense and shut the shrine. She then stood up and placed her shoes back on her feet. As she was leaving the clearing she saw Ranma silently standing there watching her. She was shocked, not only had Ranma been able to find her but he was able to sneak up on her undetected. If there was one thing that Mihoshi prided herself above anything else was her exceptional hearing. That was why she loved living at the Masaki home, for the most part it was quiet and ever since Ryoko and Ayeka started using the training room for their fights it has been down right peaceful. So Ranma being able to sneak up on her really surprised her. "Ranma! What are you doing here?"<p>"Well I went looking for you to tell you something and when I couldn't find you I got worried. So, what were you doing."<p>When Mihoshi heard that Ranma was worried about her she smiled. He had just shown that her decision had been a correct one. She then turned to the shrine that sat in the clearing and said "Saying goodbye to someone I loved."<p>Hearing that really peaked Ranma's interest. "Oh really, who?"<p>Mihoshi turned her head to look back at Ranma. "Follow me." With that she started off in a direction that would take her further into the forest.<p>"Geez," thought Ranma, "what is it with every one tellin' me to follow them." Despite his mental grousing Ranma still followed Mihoshi into the woods.<p>After about ten minutes of walking the pair came up on another clearing. Unlike the other clearing, this one had several large boulders jutting up from the ground. It also didn't look as cleared out as the last one.<p>When Mihoshi entered the clearing she immediately headed towards one of the boulders. Once she reached it she sat down on the boulder and motioned for Ranma to join her. When Ranma sat beside her Mihoshi said, "What I'm about to tell you stays between us. If I want the others to know I'll tell them, ok."<p>Ranma nodded, "Yeah sure, I can keep a secret."<p>"Thank you." She then thought about where to start her story. After a minute she decided to start from the beginning. "When I was in school on my world I didn't really fit in. I was clumsy and while my grades were high I came off as not being very bright outside of situations where my knowledge would come in handy. Because of this the children in my class called me slow and stupid. When I reached puberty I became even more miserable. I was always more "developed" than the other girls in my grade so consequently guys hit on me all the time. They thought that since I was stupid and beautiful I would gladly spread my legs for them. When I didn't, they just told their friends that I did, this caused me to have a reputation of being a slut. The girls thought I was trying to steal their boyfriends so they added to the rumors about me. Luckily I had one or two friends that saw past all the rumor and innuendo and treated me like a person. If it wasn't for them I might not be here to talk to you." She stopped to catch her breath and regain her composure.<p>Seeing that telling his this was really hurting Mihoshi, Ranma said, "You don't have to tell me this. I can see how much this is hurting you." Ranma really didn't like to cause anyone to experience this kind of pain.<p>With unshed tears in her eyes, Mihoshi shook her head. "No, I want you to know this." "I need you to know this," thought Mihoshi.<p>"When I finally graduated I didn't have any doubts about what I wanted to do. I have never liked bullies of any kind so I joined the Galaxy Police to protect people. On the first day I saw a woman with long dark blue hair who about my age talking to no one and looking depressed, so I went over to talk to her. When I reached her she introduced herself as Kiyone Mabiki. Her face was beautiful and yet I could see that she had a past at least as painful as my own. On her head she wore an orange headband, she wore it all the time, which was something that our superiors always hated. Later on I found out that she wore it to cover a scar that her father gave her. You see Kiyone was what you would call a lesbian, and her father was a very traditional man, so when he found out about her "unnatural" preference he beat her.<p>Well, Kiyone and I got to talking and by the end of the day we became good friends. That friendship transferred over to our work and over the next two years we were the highest-ranking cadets in our class. We did so well that we were rewarded with our own patrol ship, the Yagami. Besides graduating with honors Kiyone and I were very deeply in love and to celebrate our graduation and assignment Kiyone introduced me to the joys of physical love."<p>At hearing that Mihoshi had a relationship with a woman, Ranma's heart dropped. "So you're a lesbian too," he said morosely.<p>Mihoshi smiled and shook her head, "No I'm not a lesbian, I'm by. I enjoy a good looking guy as much as the next girl." She placed her hand n top of Ranma's, "It just means that I like good looking girls too, and that I'm more open to "odd" relationships."<p>At that, hope reappeared in Ranma's being, "Does this mean..."<p>He was silenced by Mihoshi's finger upon his lips. "Shh. I'm not done yet." She then removed her finger and looked off into the distance. "Kiyone and I were some of the best detectives that the Galaxy Police had. Between her street smarts and my book smarts there was no criminal that we couldn't catch. Ah, those were the good old days, just me and Kiyone against the scum of the universe. You wouldn't believe some of the wonders that we saw, and the best thing about them all is that I could see them with Kiyone.<p>But with everything our good times came to an end. On our final assignment we were chasing a criminal more evil and disgusting than Kagato could ever be. Among the GP he was known as Zander the butcher, though he only went by the name Zander. He would travel the space lanes and prey upon innocent ships. When he boarded a ship he would tie up everyone on board and then he would rape and kill the women in front of the men, the younger the better. Then after the women were killed he would kill the men in brutal ways. After he murdered the crew he would ransack the ship for anything that was remotely valuable. One GP patrol cruiser came across a ship he had attacked, and when they boarded they were horrified at the carnage that they saw. Women who had been raped and then cut open from chin to groin. Men who had been skinned alive and then nailed to the ship's bulkheads. While he was never as wanted as Kagato, that was only because he never did enough property damage, but as far as most officers were concerned, Zander was a priority kill.<p>One day while we were on patrol Kiyone spotted Zander's ship and we chased after him. We called for back up but the nearest ship was two days away. We chased him for hours, we would get a hit in then he would shoot back. Eventually he was able to knock out our weapons, so Kiyone rammed the Yagami into his ship. We got into space suits, activated the Yagami's locator beacon, and boarded his ship. He played with us for two hours, firing shots at us from where we would least expect him to be. After two hours we were able to trap him in his cargo hold. As I was going to cuff him, he pulled a gun, Kiyone yelled for me to duck and shot him. But unfortunately as he was falling back he was able to shoot Kiyone in the chest. She died in my arms, in her last moments the only thing on her mind was if I was safe, and then she was gone." Mihoshi was now crying as she relived that horrible day.<p>Ranma placed his arm around her shoulder and pulled her in close. "Shh, I'm here. Take your time."<p>They sat there for several minutes as Mihoshi tried to get control of her emotions. From her place against Ranma, Mihoshi continued her story. "Two days later the back up we sent for showed up, but by the time they arrived the woman that had loved Kiyone was long dead. In her place was a bumbling air head that couldn't walk without causing damage to something. When I arrived back at headquarters I got commendations and they gave me Yukinojo to replace the destroyed Yagami. Over the next year my reputation among he GP changed from Mihoshi the detective to Mihoshi the walking disaster. Since I wouldn't accept any time off, the higher ups assigned me to a remote patrol zone. One day I received a report that Kagato was nearby, and I knew that was my chance to join my love in the afterlife. So I rushed headlong towards the third planet in the Solar System, and when I got there I was nearly killed by a black hole. But a nice man named Tenchi rescued me and offered to let me live with him and the other girls that lived with him.<p>So for the next two years I lived and fought with them. Living here has been one of the best experiences of my life. Sure, I get yelled at on occasion, but in general they have treated me with kindness and respect. Even though I was happy, there was no reason for me to change back to the Mihoshi I was before Kiyone died. Then one day I found a man laying on the ground unconscious, I bumbled my way through rescuing him and I almost killed him. Over the next few days I thought over what I had done and came to a conclusion, I had to kill the bumbling idiot and revive Mihoshi, star Galaxy Police detective. It has been a slow process but I am well on my way to achieving that goal.<p>Later on, the man I found got better and forgave me for what I had done. For some reason I was immediately attracted to him. That really confused me, I had seen attractive men in the past, I had even seen Tenchi naked, and none of them made me aroused as he could. When I saw his female form, a part of me thanked the gods for delivering this vision of beauty to me. Yet, while I was attracted to the man, a part of me still stayed true to the memory of my dear Kiyone. Over the next few months the man trained me in his art and the desire I felt for him only grew, but as my desire grew something else began to happen, I started to love him. For awhile, my two sides battled over each other, I loved the man and yet my love for Kiyone remained. So I went to the person that I knew would set me on the right path, Kiyone. I boarded Yukinojo and did something I should have done along time ago, go through Kiyone's stuff. When I opened Kiyone's journal I found a letter to me. It had been written the day before she died, I guess she felt something and wrote it. In the letter she told me to keep going and if she saw me in the afterlife before my time she would never talk to me again. She also said that if she died she wanted me to find someone else and be happy. So I am going to do what she said and live my life to the fullest." She then took Ranma's hands in her own and looked into his eyes, "Ranma, I love you. I know you have fiancés waiting for you back in Nerima and I don't want to add to your problems, I just wanted to say . . ." Mihoshi couldn't say anything else due the fact that Ranma was giving her a very passionate kiss. When their lips parted all Mihoshi could say was, "Thank you."<p>Ranma smiled at her, "Mihoshi, now that I can control the Neko-Ken, I have to go back to Nerima. I would like you to come with me as my girlfriend."<p>Mihoshi pouted, "What, not as a fiancé?"<p>Ranma shook his head, "No I've done that and it didn't work out. I've never had a girlfriend. Yes, I do love you a lot, but I don't think I'll ever have a fiancé again. Wife yes, fiancé, no."<p>"Does that mean you want to get married," Mihoshi asked excitedly.<p>Ranma shook his head, "Not right now." He then took Mihoshi's hand in his own, "For now I want to just try this," he squeezed Mihoshi's hand, "out for now. Later, after we know each other better, then we can get married. If that is what you want." By the time he was finished the confidence that he had at the beginning of what he was saying.<p>Mihoshi nodded her head and smiled, not a vapid smile that says, "Look at me. I'm a Idiot." No, her smile was large and radiant, and it lit up Ranma's world. "That's fine with me. I just want to be with you."<p>While Ranma was awed by Mihoshi's smile, he was also getting uncomfortable with the mushiness level and wanted to tone it down somehow. After a few seconds a wicked gleam formed in his eyes and his most suave and debonair voice he said, "Mihoshi, close your eyes."<p>Knowing that Ranma wanted to kiss her again, Mihoshi gleefully shut her eyes and tilted her head. She waited a few seconds and then she felt Ranma's breath wash across her face. But it wasn't a kiss that graced her lips, no, she felt Ranma tap her on the nose and the whoosh of him jumping away from her. When she opened her eyes she saw Ranma standing ten feet away from her with a playful grin on his face.<p>"Tag. You're it." With that he ran off towards the house, laughing all the way.<p>Mihoshi sat on the rock for a few seconds looking at the spot Ranma had just vacated. "Why that. Grr. COME BACK HERE, RANMA." She then ran after her newly acquired boyfriend, a grin to match Ranma's was on her face.<p>*********<p>At the Masaki home the front door opened and a very wet, unhappy Ranma trudged in followed by a laughing Mihoshi. "Quiet you," grumbled the still male Ranma.<p>Mihoshi put her arms around her grumpy boyfriend. "Come on, you've got to admit, that was funny. The great martial artist, Ranma Saotome slipping on some slime and falling face first into the lake is funny. Especially that sound you made when you hit the water, Splat! Ha!"<p>By the time she was finished Ranma was chuckling along with her. They stood there laughing and basking in each other's presence until they heard someone clear their throat. But instead of jumping away from Mihoshi like he would have if he was in Nerima, Ranma simply moved her so that his arm was around her waist and they were both looking at the one who interrupted. They turned to see who coughed and saw Ryoko floating there with a sly grin.<p>Before Ryoko could start talking Ranma began talking to her. "Hey Ryoko, could you get everybody and tell them to meet me in the living room.  I've got some things I need to say."<p>Ryoko shrugged her shoulders, "Sure." She then teleported away to retrieve the rest of the family.<p>After Ryoko left, Ranma turned to Mihoshi. "I'm going upstairs to get out of these wet clothes, ok."<p>Mihoshi released herself from Ranma. "Ok, I'll be waiting for you in there," she replied as she pointed to the living room.<p>Before the couple departed each other's company they shared a brief kiss then headed off to their respective locations.<p>*********<p>On the royal throne of the Juraian Empire sat Azusa Masaki. Azusa had sat on the throne for many millennia, and in his time his people have called him a just and wise ruler. In his life he had fought in many battles and no one could accuse him of fearing man nor beast. But there was something in this cosmos that could send chills down his spin and freeze his very soul, his wives.<p>Currently his wives Funaho and Misaki, Captain of the Royal Guards, were hashing out the final details of THEIR vacation to Earth. Unlike their previous visit to the insignificant orb, the wives have planned a multi-week trip. The one detail of their planning that really bothered Azusa was that, despite his wishes, his wives told him that he was coming along. Misaki had rationalized this leave of absence by saying that he needed a vacation. On the other hand, Funaho had told him that if he didn't go then he would be sleeping on the 'shudder' couch for the next two years. Now while this may seem harsh to some, to a member of the Juraian royal family who have lifespans that measure in the ten of thousands of years, two years seem like two weeks.<p>As his wives were hashing out the details, Azusa was trapped in his throne. So he was forced to sit there as they decided what kind of bathing suits they would bring and where they would go. Occasionally one of his wives would ask his opinion on something and Azusa would answer in the way that all males answer their significant others, "Whatever you want dear," OR, "that looks great on you."<p>As Azusa sat in his throne he was bored out of his skull. He was so bored that his higher brain functions had shut down and his mind slipped into shopping mode. When Azusa saw a glowing red circle appear on the throne room door it was a welcome distraction. After two seconds of watching the circle it violently exploded. Immediately after the explosion Azusa bolted out of his chair. By the time he was standing the throne room guards had surrounded him and Misaki was in front of him, all ready to protect their emperor. When the smoke from the explosion had cleared Azusa saw a head poking out of the hole in the door. The person's face was pale and evil.<p>"Was I interrupting something? Good." The head retreated from the door and a few seconds later the door was blown off it's hinges. Out of the smoke stepped a man in black pants, a red shirt, and a black jacket.<p>As the man walked towards the throne Azusa pushed his way through the guards. "What is the meaning of this," he bellowed.<p>"Why I'm here to take you into custody in the name of Lady Tokimi."<p>"Arrest me? Who." He stopped as Misaki flew past him towards the unknown man.<p>As Misaki was about to punch the man he grabbed her by the neck and brought her face close to his own. "Now that isn't becoming behavior for an empress. You should be ashamed for yourself." With that he punched her in the stomach and then threw her at Azusa.<p>Azusa caught his wife with a grunt. He looked down and asked her if she was all right but all he got from her was a groan. He then glared at the man. "You bastard, who are you and what gives you the right to come here and hurt my wife?"<p>The man staggered back and clutched his heart. "Bastard? Oh how you wound me." He then stood up straight and stared walking towards Azusa once more. "My name is Zander. And my lady gives me the right to be here." Zander walked several more steps and then he was stopped by ten Light Hawk Wings. After he stopped, Tsunami appeared on the other side of the wings. "YOU," Zander snarled.<p>Azusa was in awe, never in his life had he seen all ten Light Hawk Wings. When his goddess appeared he almost bowed to her, it was only the fact that he was holding his wife and the situation in general that kept him from doing so.<p>*********<p>Tsunami knew what would happen when she granted Ranma the ability to use his wing and had been waiting for Tokimi to do something. If there was one thing about her sister that remained constant since before they came to this universe it was that she had a wicked temper. Before the crossing Tokimi was a very nice women but beware, if you ever got her angry there would be hell to pay. Now though, all that remained was her temper. To Tsunami, it seemed as if when her followers died, so too did her heart. Knowing her sister like she did, it came as no surprise that Tokimi sent her knight to attack Jurai. All she had to do was to make sure the emperor and his wives were safe and on their way to Earth.<p>While still keeping her barrier up Tsunami turned her head to face Azusa. "Go. Run. Find Tenchi, he can save us all." With that she used a portion of her power to send Azusa and his entourage to the imperial flagship, also known as the Throne.<p>*********<p>In the middle of the Throne's command deck twenty people materialized. As soon as he regained his bearings Azusa immediately liked up o the Throne's tree and asked it to transport them to Earth as quickly as possible. Though running to some backwater planet to get some boy's help rubbed him the wrong way, Azusa was obliged to follow his goddess' commands.<p>The Throne, sensing Azusa's need, called upon all the power not reserved for life support and opened a subspace portal to Earth.<p>*********<p>Back on Jurai when Tsunami felt that Azusa and his family were out of harms way she lowered her wings and waited for the inevitable.<p>When Tsunami lowered her defenses, Zander ceased his assault and knelled. He did not do this out of respect for Tsunami. No, he kneeled because he could feel that his lady would make her presence known. He was still indebted to her, after those GP bitches left him for dead Tokimi came to him and offered him power in exchange for his eternal servitude. Zander felt that her offer was a fair one and accepted, besides, it was either work for her or die.<p>High above Jurai, far beyond the range of the defense rings, a huge golden structure appeared. Tokimi had arrived in the Jurai system.<p>From inside the hall Tokimi look down on the planet. Her first instinct was to atomize it, but she quickly realized that it wasn't the Juraians fault for worshipping Tsunami. Tokimi knew that as soon as they saw the glory that was her they would beg to be her followers. She then called out to her knight, "Zander, bring Tsunami to me."<p>On the platform before Tokimi, Zander and his captive Tsunami appeared. Zander went down on one knee, Tsunami stared defiantly at her sister.<p>With his head still down, Zander gestured to Tsunami. "My lady, I present your sister Tsunami."<p>"Very good Zander, you have done well. Now leave my sister and I alone for a while, we have much catching up to do."<p>"As you wish my lady." Zander then teleported away to prepare for the halls arrival on the planet.<p>Back in the hall Tokimi lowered herself down so that she was standing eye to eye with Tsunami. She walked around her sister, trying to see if she looked any different. Once she made one complete circuit around her sister, Tokimi finally addressed Tsunami. "Tsunami, Tsunami, why did you break our rules and give that boy our power?"<p>Tsunami stared defiantly at her sister, "To stop you and hopefully get you back to the way you were."<p>Tokimi hissed and stepped back as if Tsunami's words had hurt her. "The way I was? You want me to be weak again? Well that will never happen again, I'll remain as I am, strong. And through that strength I will keep what happened to our home from ever occurring again!"<p>Tsunami shook her head, "Listen to yourself. The brothers were not strong enough to stop Melcor, how do you think that you ever will be?"<p>"Power isn't needed to beat Melcor, unity is. By having all of this universe under my banner we shall surely defeat him."<p>Tsunami sadly shook her head. "I see that it is pointless to try to argue with you so I will just stand here."<p>An evil smile formed on Tokimi's face. "Oh you will be doing more than standing." Tokimi snapped her fingers and a table appeared behind Tsunami and latched it self onto the blue hared goddess. Tokimi leaned in until her face was almost touching Tsunami's, "You will be learning." With that energy started arcing across Tsunami's body causing her to scream in agony.<p>*********<p>In the Masaki living room all the residents were gathered to listen to an announcement that Ranma had to make. All the residents were seated in the same locations as they were when Ranma first talked to them. The main difference between this time and the last was that Ryoko, Tenchi, and Ayeka were cuddling and that Ranma and Mihoshi were holding hands.<p>Though he didn't stand up or remove his hand from Mihoshi's, Ranma did sit up straight when he started to address the assembled group. "Guys, I got to leave." Ranma expected a large response from this statement but it never came. Seeing that no one was going to try to convince him to say, even Sasami, Ranma's heart fell. "I made a promise to some people in Nerima and now that I can control the Neko-Ken I got to keep it. Mihoshi is coming with me so I can show her to my mother and to help me break my engagements. You guys can come if you want but I'll understand if you don't."<p>Tenchi leaned forward and detached himself from Ryoko and Ayeka. "I can only speak for myself but I would happy to come along with you."<p>Ryoko and Ayeka looked at each other for a second then nodded. They then looked at Ranma and said, "We're going too."<p>Though she seemed out of it Sasami also volunteered to go. But as Washu was about to say that she was also going, Sasami screamed and went into convulsions. Immediately, the entire group was around her trying to help the girl. Washu was the fastest in getting to her and was already taking Sasami's vital when the others reached her. After several seconds the convulsions slowed and Sasami moaned, "Tokimi," then went completely silent.<p>As Sasami started convulsing and everyone went to help her something happened to Katsuhito. His body shimmered and in his place stood a much younger man. Yosho's disguise field dropped and his secret was exposed.<p>When Washu heard Sasami call out that name her eyes rolled back and all of her voluntary muscles lock. As she fell backwards Yosho tried to catch her, but just as he was about to touch her she disappeared in a burst of white light.<p>When Washu disappeared, the chaos that Sasami had created only increased. Ranma and Tenchi were trying to get their girlfriends under control when the senses granted to them by the Light Hawk Wings told them that something was going on outside. At the same time Mihoshi's watch began to go haywire. Since Sasami's convulsions had stopped, Tenchi was pissed at his grandfather for lying to them, and there was nothing they could do for Washu, Ranma and Tenchi decided to check on the disturbance outside. When they got outside they were joined by Mihoshi with her GP issue sidearm drawn and ready to fire. At first the trio saw nothing out of the ordinary, then a swirling blue portal opened above them. Tenchi and Mihoshi immediately recognized it as the same created by the Juraian imperial flagship. When the flagship exited the portal it didn't close the same way it opened, instead of irising shut, the portal fizzled out. The ship didn't just float there either, it slowly drifted towards the lake. As it was falling a group of people materialized on the dock.<p>When the group appeared on the dock and Ranma saw all of the tree weapons that they were carrying, he slipped into a combat stance. He calmed down when Tenchi started walking towards the group. Ranma stepped over to Mihoshi, "Who are they?"<p>"The man in the middle is Azusa, the Emperor of Jurai. The woman with the black hair is his wife Funaho. I don't see his other wife Misaki though."<p>It was then that Tenchi yelled back to them. "Mihoshi, get some help! Misaki is hurt."<p>Mihoshi ran inside to get some help and supplies. Ranma ran up to Tenchi to see if he could provide any aid. "What's wrong? Why're they here?"<p>Tenchi looked at Ranma grimly, "Jurai has been invaded."<p>*********<p>In an endless white expanse floated the scientist Washu. Her nude adult body lazily floated in a fetal position through the expanse. If her body was still then her mind was traveling at warp speed. As she was floating there, her consciousness was being bombarded with memories. Some, like the ones from the last twenty thousand years, were familiar, the memories of the billion years before that were new and strange. Yet, despite this strangeness, they seemed real and welcome. Even the memories of her followers' destruction were welcome because they helped to answer her question. A question that has plagued her since she descended and became Washu, scientist, who was she and why was she here. Now, for the first time, she knew, she was Washu Goddess of Knowledge, the greatest scientific genius in the universe, sister to Tsunami and Tokimi, and mother of Ryoko. For the first time in her long existence Washu felt complete and this brought to her such joy that she was silently crying. Soon Washu's re- expanded senses heralded the coming of a large power. She opened her eyes and straitened herself out so that she could get a better look at a spot of white that was more intense than the rest of the space.<p>The white grew brighter and brighter until it coalesced into the shape of a person. The light then burst and its place stood a man. He was six two and had short blond hair. The man's face was kind and gentle. His deep blue eyes gleamed with wisdom and to Washu's eyes they gave off a faint glow. He was wearing a white polo shirt tucked into black dress pants. Over the shirt he wore a waist-length denim jacket. The man's brown shoes were planted firmly to a nonexistent floor. He looked at Washu and gave her a smile that was full of love. The love that he was expressing was not the kind of love that is expressed between lovers, but the kind felt between father and daughter, or brother and sister. "Hello Washu. It's been along time."<p>Washu was shocked, now that she had all her memories she knew who this man was. She also knew that she shouldn't be able to remember him. "YOU! What are you doing here, and why do I even remember you. I locked all of my memories into the gems."<p>The man shook his head, "Oh Washu. For the Goddess of Knowledge you still don't understand the nature of the wings' power. Yes, you put all of your memories and power into the gems but they don't contain everything that makes you a goddess. You still have the soul of a goddess. It was your soul that kept your memories alive, but buried. It was your soul that has been gathering energy so that your powers could return."<p>Washu looked at him as if he were crazy, "My soul? If it was doing what you said, why do I only just now have my old memories.?"<p>"It took some time for you to gather enough energy to break through all the mental barriers you had set up. After you had enough energy, you still needed something to trigger your memories. Tsunami wouldn't work because everyone knows about her, it had to be one of us that your other self had never heard of before. When your memories started coming back I brought you here to experience them in peace and to tell you something."<p>"What do you want tell me?"<p>"That boy, Ranma, keep an eye on him. He wields phenomenal power."<p>"You mean the Light Hawk Wings," asked Washu in confusion. How could a man that wields twenty wings be afraid of Ranma?<p>The man shook his head, "No, not Light Hawk Wings, something with the potential to be far more powerful. I once met two very powerful sisters, and they warned me of the power Ranma wields. Though they didn't have a name for that power, they showed me what the energy pattern would look like. They also told me that human souls are the only ones that can tap this power. So for years I have watched the world you now live on and I saw many men using that power. At first I was worried, then I looked into their souls and saw the light of goodness in each. Eventually, only one used the power but he had to be feral to do so."<p>"You mean Ranma," asked Washu. It was a rhetorical question but she needed to know if she was on the right track. For if she was that would mean that in gaining control of the Neko-Ken, Ranma inadvertently tapped into a power that would give pause to even the most powerful of gods.<p>"Yes, Ranma. I have watched that boy for sometime, and I have seen Tokimi's meddling in his life. But every time I tried to stop her, something else had already acted. It seems we are not the only ones with interest in Ranma. So, as I said, watch him, and be sure he stays in the light."<p>Washu nodded her head, "Sure I will. Now how do I get back?"<p>"I'll send you."<p>Washu felt herself leaving the white expanse. Before she was completely gone she heard the man call out, "Washu! Great breasts!"<p>In the Masaki living room everyone was startled when Washu appeared grumbling about perverts who don't remind her she was naked. They were also weirded out by Washu's outfit. She was wearing puffy purple pants, a long sleeved purple blouse. Around her waist she wore a wide belt with a "W" shaped belt buckle. The blouse's neck was low cut, giving anyone who looked at her a peak at her more prominent assets. Attached to the blouse's shoulders were large green gems in the shape of cats eyes, and attached to these was a thin golden bar that extended half the distance from the gem and the top of her head. The bar then circled the back of her head and descended to the other gem.<p>After several seconds of grumbling Washu glanced down at her attire and decided that her goddess robes were inappropriate for her current self.  She switched to the clothes that she was wearing before her memories and found that it too was unsatisfactory. Washu closed her eyes and while focusing her power she set out to form the perfect outfit for herself. The red vest that she was wearing morphed into an elegant red lab coat with a collar that enclosed a third of her head. The legs of the pale green shorts that she was wearing slid downwards to form a pair of silky pants. The thin black belt around her waist widened slightly, and on the buckle an ornate "W" appeared. Her blouse remained unchanged but it was joined by a light brown vest. Around her neck formed a golden chain, and from the chain hung a small, green, cat eye gem. When the changes to her outfit were complete Washu created a mirror in front of her to see how she looked. After a minute of posing Washu said, "Not bad for half power." She then dematerialized the mirror and in it's place she saw the stunned faces of her family, the emperor of Jurai, Funaho, and a half dozen well armed men in armor.<p>*********<p>When the news of Jurai's invasion reached the rest of the shrine's occupants, chaos became bedlam.<p>Ayeka's sanity was near the breaking point. First her darling sister has convulsions then goes unconscious. Next, her brother, the man that she loved for most of her life was exposed as a fraud. Then the person that could help Sasami disappeared in a burst of light. Finally, her father arrives with the news that Jurai was invaded and her mother is severely injured. If it wasn't for her love, Ryoko, staying by her side and offering support, Ayeka would have either passed out or broken down crying.<p>*********<p>Though she outwardly looked calm and collected, inside Ryoko was crying. Something had happened to Sasami, the girl she thought of as her little sister. While she wasn't shocked about Yosho she was pissed that he choose this moment to reveal himself. Washu, her mother, was gone, vanished in an explosion of white light. Over the last couple of months she and Washu had been getting closer, it had gotten to the point that Ryoko had stopped thinking of Washu as a pest and started thinking of Washu as her mother. It was Washu that convinced her to take a chance and tell her beloveds of her feelings.<p>Then, as if Sasami, Yosho, and Washu were not enough, Azusa comes and tells them that Jurai has been taken over. This caused Ryoko to feel something that she loathed, helplessness. All through her time as Kagato's slave that emotion ran through her veins. Ever since Tenchi freed her she has done everything in her power not to feel this way. Yet despite all that, she now feels helpless. Her only comfort was when she had a chance she would make Yosho pay for the pain he inflicted upon her loves.<p>*********<p>While Ryoko and Ayeka were looking after Sasami and Misaki, Yosho was talking with his father. "So you say this man blew the throne room doors off its hinges," he asked incredulously. To Yosho the feat seemed impossible, for the throne room doors and their hinges were made out of the strongest metals in the universe. On top of that, the whole assembly had Juraian power running through it to add extra strength.<p>Azusa grimly nodded, "Yes, after that he just calmly walked into the throne room. Misaki tried to stop him but he punched her in the stomach so hard that she flew twenty feet straight at me. He then told us his name, he said the he was called Zander." He was stopped from any further explanation by a loud clattering noise.<p>*********<p>As everyone went about their business, Tenchi stood in the corner silently seething. He was angry because Sasami, and therefore Ayeka, was in pain and there was nothing that he could do to alleviate it. He was angry that Washu was gone for three reasons: first, with her gone there is no-one to look after Sasami and Misaki, second, Ryoko was hurting because her mother disappeared, third, from the way she looked when she disappeared, Washu didn't leave willingly. He was angry that someone would attack Jurai, while he felt no real attachment to the world he could imagine what horrors the people of Jurai were facing. And the final injustice, the one thing that truly pissed him off was the fact that his grandfather, a man that, in the eyes of Tenchi, had always been a paragon of virtue, had lied to them. This wasn't like the lie of not being Yosho, Tenchi could understand the reasoning behind that decision. But after they found out that he was really Yosho he should have told them everything, not waited until their entire world that they had built was under attack. If he had revealed himself anytime but now Tenchi would have probably forgiven him, but now, there was little room for forgiveness in Tenchi's heart.<p>*********<p>While others were talking or comforting each other, Ranma and Mihoshi were going around and making sure that everyone was comfortable. Neither of them were really shook up over the news that Azusa brought. Sure, they were concerned, but there were more pressing issues at hand, such as where they were going to put the twenty people that just arrived. As they scurried around they made sure that the people were fed and cared for. On one trip out of the kitchen Mihoshi was holding a tray of food for the guards that she and Ranma had made. While walking past Yosho and Azusa, Mihoshi happened to overhear the part about the man who attacked Jurai being called Zander. When she heard that Mihoshi's blood ran cold and all the color drained from her face. She was so shocked she dropped the tray she was holding and began to look around wildly. "It just isn't possible," she thought. "I saw Kiyone shoot him, she hit his heart. I even checked him with my cube, he was defiantly dead. I must know what he looked like."  With that thought in mind she seized hold of Azusa robes and yelled, "Zander, Zander! What did he look like? Tell me!"<p>Before Azusa's guards could restrain Mihoshi, Ranma was already pulling his girlfriend off of the stunned emperor. As he tried to calm her down Ranma whispered reassurances into Mihoshi's ear, "Shh, it's all right.  It can't be the same guy. You saw him die, remember. Just you wait, he is going to tell us what the guy looked like and it won't be him. Will it," the last was to Mihoshi and Azusa. For the emperor's benefit Ranma also added a glare that said that Azusa better give the right answer or there would be hell to pay.<p>Azusa received the message loud and clear. And unlike others who talked to him, Ranma actually impressed the gruff man. People always deferred to him because he was the leader, but here was a boy that could give a glare as menacing as the ones that Funaho could dish out. Azusa found himself respecting this boy. He began to describe the man who attacked his home hoping that it would not cause Mihoshi any more pain.<p>Ranma's words had calmed Mihoshi's fear addled mind down. Unfortunately Azusa's description of the man shattered what little calm she was able to achieve. But instead of hysterics she began to cry into Ranma's shoulder.<p>Before Ranma could reprimand Azusa for giving Mihoshi more grief a bright flash appeared in the center of the room.<p>*********<p>Everyone looked to where the flash occurred and were shocked t see an adult Washu in a purple outfit. Their shock continued as they watched her clothes morph into a new arrangement and she created a mirror. As she was performing these miracles Ranma and Tenchi's Light Hawk senses were going haywire. After the mirror disappeared she looked upon the stunned faces of her family and said, "What?"<p>Washu was then tackled by two people, Ayeka and Ryoko. Ayeka was asking for Washu's help with her family. Ryoko was holding onto Washu for dear life silent tears were making there way down her face. Washu saw them and opened her link with her daughter, "[Why are you crying my little Ryoko?]"<p>Ryoko looked into her mother's eyes and spoke over the link. "[I'm just happy that you're ok.]" Ryoko wanted to say more but she wasn't sure how.<p>Washu smiled at her daughter. She had gotten Ryoko's feelings along with her mind speech. Washu then pried off the two girls and looked at Ayeka, "Why don't we take a look at your family now, ok." When the girl in question nodded her head, Washu walked over to Sasami. She placed her hand over Sasami's head and closed her eyes. After several seconds, Washu removed her hand and sadly shook her head, "Oh my sister. You went too far." Washu walked over to Misaki and performed the some procedure. When she removed her hand she made her holographic keyboard appear in front of her. Washu tapped on the keyboard for several seconds, when she stopped a small black portal opened beside her. She reached inside and pulled out a hypo gun, after checking the gun to make sure that the pressure was correct she pressed it against Misaki's neck. As Washu removed the gun from her patient's neck, Azusa appeared next to her.<p>"Miss Washu, what is wrong with my darling girl and what was that you gave to my wife?" The only reason that he wasn't going bonkers about Washu injecting Misaki was that Azusa knew Washu's reputation of being able to fix any problem.<p>"As for Misaki, I just gave her something that would speed up her recovery."<p>"Yes. And Sasami?"<p>Washu looked away from the emperor and stood up. "She should regain consciousness in a few minutes." She then looked to the group, "Every one, gather around the table. We have much to discuss."<p>The guards scurried away from the table so the important people could sit at it. At the head of the table sat Azusa with Funaho sitting on the right next to him. Going down the right side of the table sat Ayeka, Tenchi, and Ryoko. At the end opposite of Azusa and Funaho sat Washu. Along the left side of the table sat Mihoshi, Ranma, and Yosho.<p>"Ok Washu, we're here now what do you want to say," asked a gruff Ryoko. While she wasn't mad at the scientist, Ryoko still had to cover from her prior emotional outburst.<p>"First of all, something happened on Jurai and I would like to hear all the details."<p>Azusa nodded his head, "Very well." He then went on about how Zander attacked the Royal Throne Room, making sure to leave no detail out.<p>As Azusa gave his rendition on how things happened Washu was watching the group's reactions. Every one behaved in a predictable except Ranma and Mihoshi, their reactions peaked the genius's interest. When Azusa finished, Washu asked the question that every one needed to know, "This Zander, did he have any markings n his forehead?"<p>"Yes he did. He had black triangles on his forehead. I didn't think much about them before, are they important somehow."<p>"Before I answer that I have a question for you two," said Washu as she pointed to Ranma and Mihoshi. "You seem to have heard of this Zander person. Who is he."<p>When Mihoshi heard that she went cold. She didn't want to go through that again. Just telling Ranma was hard enough.<p>Luckily Ranma sensed his girlfriend's reluctance and asked her. "Do you want me to tell them?" A small nod of her head was the only answer he received. He then turned his attention to Washu. "About two years ago Zander was a wanted man. I'm not going to say what he was wanted, for but let's just say it wasn't because he was good. One day Mihoshi and her partner, Kiyone, found Zander and chased him. It ended with Zander and Kiyone dead. What I want to know is how could he be alive."<p>While what Ranma said wasn't as detailed as she would like, Washu could hack into the GP mainframe to find out the rest of the information. Before she could answer Ranma's question Tenchi interrupted her.<p>Her pointed an accusatory finger at Yosho, "What I want to know is why you pick now to show yourself? Couldn't you see that now wasn't the best time?"<p>Yosho guiltily looked own to the table. "This, revelation, is not of my choosing. Believe me when I say that if I could I would have revealed my secret at another time. But something has happened to Tsunami and I can no longer utilize my disguise field."<p>"But why didn't you tell me? You knew how I felt about you," said Ayeka.<p>"Ayeka, I know this will hurt but I never thought of you as a potential wife. To me you were always a sister. When you arrived on Earth I had already had a family and I didn't want to start a new one. After you discovered who I really was I was tempted to tell you everything but I saw how you were starting to fall for Tenchi and I didn't want to confuse you. Please forgive me."<p>From where she sat next to Tenchi, Ayeka thought about what her brother said. The only conclusion that she could come to was that he was right in his reasoning. If he had told her any earlier it would have confused her and might have delayed her wondrous relationship with her dual loves. She looked to her brother and saw the guilty look on his face, "Yosho you are correct in your assumptions and I thank you for that. I also thank you for telling the truth when you had to. I forgive you."<p>Washu smiled at the purple haired princess. "Well if there is no-one else that wants to deal with something let's deal with the current issue, the whys of the invasion of Jurai."<p>All eyes turned to Tenchi to see if he was going to object. He decided to say nothing more about his grandfather's duplicity since Ayeka forgave him. But as far as Tenchi was concerned it would take Yosho some time to redeem himself. Seeing everyone's eyes upon him Tenchi raised his hands and shook his head.<p>At seeing that there were no further off topic discussions Washu leaned back and folded her arms under her now more ample bosom. "Good. I assume that everyone here knows that Tsunami is a goddess and that she is very powerful." Everyone at the table gave her a look that said, "Well duh!" "Right. Well what you don't know is that she was only one of the goddesses in this universe. The others, her sisters are still around but they haven't been as open as Tsunami has. Her sisters names are; Tokimi, the goddess of chaos, and Washu, the goddess of knowledge."<p>At her announcement every one at the table was speech less. Speech less, that is until Ryoko stated her disbelief by bursting into side- splitting laughter. "You a goddess! Ha! If you're tellin' the truth then that means I'm the daughter of a goddess." Ryoko's laughter was brought up short by her mother's voice in her mind. "[You're exactly right, little one.]"<p>"Yes, I am a goddess and the sister to Tsunami, though I have only now remembered that. You see we are refugees from a destroyed universe. As a great evil that we were unable to defeat was destroying our home, a handful of us escaped to this universe so that we wouldn't be plunged into oblivion as our followers were. When we arrived Tsunami immediately searched for a world where her remaining subjects could live and hopefully one day regain their former glory. The world that she chose became known as Jurai. Having no remaining followers of our own, Tokimi and I explored this new universe. After some time I grew bored and decided to do something unprecedented, give up my divinity and become as mortal as I could be. You see, despite the fact that I am the goddess of knowledge I knew little about the universe. It was my hope that by descending I could gain the knowledge I desired. Tokimi said that I was insane to give up my godhood, I said that I was right and that there was nothing she could do about it. Tsunami, being the kind soul that she is, tried to mediate the dispute but instead she was drawn in herself. So it became a three-way argument. Tokimi, who by this point was insane due to her followers being killed, felt that we should use our power to bend this universe to our will and ensure that the destruction of our home could never happen again. Tsunami felt that by giving our power to mortals their unorthodox ideas could prevent the destruction. I, like Tsunami, felt that mortals were the key, but that we should study them closely and choose the right ones to give new power to. For if our power was unable to prevent the last cataclysm, how would it be different now. Eventually we decided that the only way to solve this problem was for each of us to test our hypothesis and with the data that we collect create a fighter to test against the other's fighters. The fighter that won obviously had the better philosophy.<p>As I prepared to descend I created three gems, and I placed all of my knowledge and power into them. I left myself just enough power to defend myself should the need arise. I then put myself on a world and willed myself to forget everything but my name and some basic skills. So I lived like a mortal, learning all I could. I got married and had a child, only to have them taken away from me. All the while I had a need to find a person to give the three mysterious gems, that I had, to. So, to fill my need for family and a bearer of my gems, I created Ryoko. A daughter that I could love with all my heart and a champion that would be powerful enough to prove that I was right." She was stopped by Ryoko slamming her hands on the table.<p>"Is that all I am for you, a weapon in some kind of pissing match." Ryoko was furious and hurt. To think, the mother that she had come to love only considered her as a weapon.<p>"No! Ryoko you must believe me, you are not a weapon. If I considered you as a weapon then I would never have used my own ovum to create you. I also wouldn't have spent such time and effort getting to know you again. When Kagato kidnapped you and forced you to do all those horrible things I was heartbroken. I had always planed on giving you the choice to fight, if I planed to force you to fight then I would be no better than what Tokimi became." "[Please believe me my little Ryoko.]" With that mental plea Washu set all of her love for Ryoko across the link.<p>When Ryoko felt her mother's love for her she dove into Washu's arms and cried. After several minutes Ryoko pulled away from her mother's embrace and wiped her arm across her face to dry the remaining tears. When she looked up and saw the smiling faces of her extended family she blushed in embarrassment. "Come on Washu, get on with the story."<p>"Of course," answered Washu with a loving smile. "As I said, Kagato kidnapped Ryoko from me and used her to start a reign of terror. Eventually, she was imprisoned by Yosho only to be released seven hundred years later by Tenchi. Now, Tenchi is a rare and special person, he was born with the potential to use the Light Hawk Wings independently of Tsunami's power. When Kagato nearly killed Tenchi, Tsunami awakened his potential and claimed him as her champion. I can only guess that it was during this time that Tokimi claimed Zander as her champion."<p>"So does that mean that this Zander person has the same potential as Tenchi," asked Ayeka.<p>"It's possible. But I think that Tokimi made it so hat he could use the wings. You see, when I was a goddess we knew of three ways a person could use the wings: be born with them, be born with the potential, or have them forced upon them. The third way is painful but the person doing the forcing can control the amount of wings. Now the battle between our chosen representatives probably wouldn't have happened for many more centuries, but because Tsunami broke the rules, Tokimi has started early."<p>Azusa was infuriated, how dare Washu say that about Tsunami. How dare she say that about his goddess. "Why do you say such lies about our deity. Tsunami is a paragon of virtue that would never break a rule!"<p>Washu sat there and looked at Azusa for several seconds. Then she started laughing. She was laughing so hard that she was rolling around on the floor. When she was able to pull herself together and stop laughing she looked at the red-faced emperor. "What Tsunami are you talking about. The Tsunami that I remember once pantsed a man while he was giving a speech in front of my world's general assembly. Tsunami had the unofficial title of goddess of pranks, which was in stark contrast with her prudish attitudes." She shook her head for a few seconds at the absurdity of her sister. "Now as I was saying, Tsunami broke the rules about have only one champion. I have to admit it was partially my fault that Ranma got the potential in the first place, but she didn't have to activate it."<p>"Woah, woah, are you telling me that some one else from this planet that can use Tsunami's power," Azusa said incredulously.<p>Everyone pointed at Ranma and Yosho answered his father's question. "Ranma can use the Light Hawk Wings as well."<p>Azusa looked slightly manic. "Please tell me that he is somehow related to us." He really needed that to be the fact. All of his life he had believed in the power of the Juraian Empire. Yet every time he hears of this backwater planet there is another powerful person.<p>Yosho shook his head, "Until Mihoshi found him he was 100% human."<p>On her side of the table Washu's eye was twitching. All these interruptions were really getting to her. "AS I WAS SAYING! When Tsunami activated Ranma's power Tokimi got angry she invaded Jurai so that she could show her that she was wrong."<p>********* Tokimi's Hall Two Weeks Later<p>The goddess Tokimi was not a happy camper. After she landed her hall on Jurai she deployed her shades, echoes of Tokimi's dead followers that she created with her power. It was Tokimi's hope that they would be able to convince Tsunami's people to follow her. It seems that they had the opposite effect. "I need something to cheer me up," stated the grumpy goddess. Since she was still the same size as when she was "talking" to Tsunami she was pacing about the golden pedestal. After several seconds of random pacing she perked up considerably. "I know! I'll use my tool, I mean Setsuna, to check up on my nemesis. That stupid "emperor" should have reached them by now. Hopefully they will have been so depressed that they killed themselves."<p>Through Setsuna she looked into the valley where all her problems resided. As she looked at what Ranma was doing she felt an energy signature coming off of him and it caused to get even angrier. She remembered that signature, when someone twice as powerful as her warns her about something she doesn't forget that kind of thing. She decided to use the Time Gates to find where he got this power from, because if one of her sisters gave him that power then there would be no mercy for the culprit. As she looked over Ranma's life she kept a sharp eye out for that certain signature. When she found out how he got it Tokimi's sanity packed its bags and flew to Hawaii. It was her fault for him having that power. By getting that book to Ranma's fat, stupid father he was able to get a power that gave the Brothers pause.<p>Tokimi removed herself from Setsuna's mind and let off a scream. It was so laud and so powerful that people all over the sector stopped in their tracks and shuddered. For her scream was not a happy one, it told of a person that was insane and was going to kill people in very messy ways.<p>********<p>Authors Notes: Well, we come to the end of another chapter in this work of fiction and a lot of things have happened.
