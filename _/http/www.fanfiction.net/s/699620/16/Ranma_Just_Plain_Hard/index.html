</div>Ranma; Just Plain Hard<p>"Sounds like it's coming from the bathroom..." Akane whispered, holding the barbell. Nabiki stayed at the top of the stairs, while Kasumi kept behind Akane. The two sisters tentatively approached the bathroom door, just before it swung open, barely missing them. Ranma-chan ran out with someone on her tail; Kasumi didn't know who it was, but Akane had her suspicions. She would be able to get some small measure of revenge for her hairdo, at least.<p>Nabiki had watched the two streaks race by, and then saw her sisters running after them. Several moment's later, the middle Tendou sister heard swearing from a male voice, and then Ranma's rather angry, though female voice calling out. Nabiki sighed, wondering if nights like this were going to be often, and decided to enter the bathroom to investigate whatever the commotion was.<p>Ryoga staggered about, holding the back of his head in pain, and swearing about stupid red-headed bitches and their backup. Finally, he looked up, and did not recognize where he was. "Damn, where the Hell am I know?" The lost boy swore, as he walked down the hall. He turned into the first door he found, and noted it was the bathroom he and Ranma were in not too long ago. He turned to leave, and found the door had been moved, much to his irritation. He turned to see where the bathroom exit had been relocated to, and found another wall in its stead. Growing fustrated, Ryoga took one more turn, and found a doorway, not the same one he had came in through, but one nonetheless that would be a start.<p>"Fuck you, Ranma, when I find you again I'll...<p>"HEY!"<p>Nabiki heard mumbling from the outer room of the bathroom. Thinking it was Ranma, she stalked out, ready to give him a piece of her mind for waking her and her sisters up in the middle of the night, and didn't realize how close the other occupant in the furo room was, "HEY!"<p>Ryoga had the momentum well over Nabiki, and when they colided, his leg got entangled with her's, and he fell forward, with Nabiki under her. He had barely managed to arrest his fall from landing completely on her, but found her bare buttcheek landing on his hand.<p>Ryoga blinked, realizing that he had a near naked girl under him, and fell right into character. He turned his hand up, and squeezed firmly, "Nice muscletone."<p>Nabiki began to smile at Ryoga a smile that was saccarine sweet, but totally devoid of humor. Her hand that wasn't pressed against his chest to keep him from laying completely flat on her started to move between them, flexing tightly. "Thanks," she replied, "Now, you have three seconds to Get. The. Hell. Off me."<p>Ryoga noted her smile changed to a mean grin, with each word punctuated, and knew how to counter, "Now don't be like that! I'll tell you what, how about I massage that tender ass of yours, I bet it's sore from the fall, ne?"<p>Nabiki wasn't paying attention to what he said, instead looking wide eyed towards Ranma, standing at the bathroom door with a neutral expression. Immidiately, she realized the position she was in, "Oh, oh no, Ranma, this isn't what it looks like! RANMA!" The redhead ignored her, and slammed the door so hard, it fell into the bathroom.<p>Ryoga had turned around, and seen the redhead depart. Instead of giving chase, he indulged in the small victory he accomplished, "So, I guess Ranma had something for youuuuUUUUUUU!"<p>Nabiki's hand had gone into action, and Ryoga's high pitched shrill, and attempt to back away from the pain, pulled the girl up into kneeling. Nabiki fully stood, holding firmly, and rather tightly onto Ryoga, while she walked briskly forward, backing him into a wall.<p>"I told you to get the hell off me, didn't I?" the middle Tendou sister growled, while she started to glow blue.<p>Ryoga nodded frantically, before chanting in a high pitched whisper, "My nuts, my nuts..."<p>Nabiki leaned in closer to his face, "If I ever see you again, your 'nuts' won't be worth anything to you." Nabiki shook her hand, to show she meant good on her threat, before releasing Ryoga. The short-haired girl strode by Ryoga to chase after Ranma, as Ryoga slid down the wall, holding his groin.<p>After groaning, and getting some sembalence of himself together, Ryoga growled, "Damn frigid bitch!"<p>Nabiki ran into Ranma's room, only finding his father asleep with a large lump on his head, as usual, but no Ranma, "Ranma? Where are you, Ranma?" She ran down stairs, and did a quick search of the house, before growling, returning upstairs, and bursting into each of her sister's rooms. She started to glow again, at Kasumi's door, and rushed in, before imidiately rushing out. Her angry aura had blinked out, leaving only her beet red face. Good thing Kasumi was too... preoccupied to realize she had been spotted.<p>With a sullen sigh, Nabiki went back to her room, and sat on her bed, "Damn it, Ranma, you jerk..."<p>Said jerk was laying on the roof, staring into the sky. She didn't care to come back into the house, but heard Nabiki's calls for her, and her searching through the house. Ranma didn't want to hear it, though.<p>"That bitch, that bitch, that bitch, that bitch..."<p>"RANMA!" Nabiki couldn't hide the relief in her voice, as she saw the rather haggard looking red-head enter the house in the morning, "Ranma, just listen to me for a second, it... Ranma, LISTEN TO ME!"<p>Ranma walked by Nabiki, ignoring her, as she went towards the stairs to gather her bath stuff; she didn't realize how cold it was going to be that night, and needed a hot bath as soon as possible.<p>Immensely irritated by the silent treatment, Nabiki grabbed onto Ranma's arm, "Hey, quit acting like a-ow!" Without turning around, Ranma slapped Nabiki's hand away, and started up the stairs.<p>"That ungrateful, annoying, infuriating, hypocritical BASTARD!" Nabiki seethed, watching Ranma striding ahead of her and Akane. The youngest Tendou had to roll her eyes, as her sister rushed up to Ranma once again, pleading for him to listen.<p>As soon as she approached, though, he leapt onto a nearby wall, and walked precariously on its edge.<p>"RANMA! GET DOWN HER AND TALK TO ME!" Nabiki demanded, once again finding her ire impotent against his callous inattention. "Fine, if you want to be an asshole..." Nabiki started to walk briskly ahead, and the farther she got, Akane could see her posture sag.<p>With a shake of her head, Akane mumbled to herself, "Ranma, you jerk."<p>Through out school, Nabiki felt miserable. It didn't make sense to her at all; Ranma slept with BOTH her sisters, casually at that! Yet when she got caught in a highly compromising (though completely circumstantial) position with his apparent arch-nemesis, he wouldn't even look in her direction. Nabiki didn't want to acknowledge how much it *hurt* to have him doing that. Even if he were looking at her in complete anger, it would be better; that meant that there were at least feelings being directed towards her other than animosity.<p>The middle Tendou daughter trudged home with a gray cloud of meloncholy gloom hanging over her. She entered the house and gave a weak announcement of her arrival.<p>"Oh Nabiki!," Kasumi greeted, meeting her in the hall, "Is there something wrong with Ranma, he..." She stopped, as she saw her sister's downtrodden expression. "He... he went straight up to his room, but he wouldn't tell me what's wrong, and Akane told me it wasn't her business to say, though she wasn't sure. Is there something wrong between you?"<p>"Nothing I intend to straighten out, right now," Nabiki responded, putting up a front of irritation, instead of hurt. After removing her shoes, she started upstairs, and went towards Ranma's room. She raised her fist to knock, just before she heard the song playing from his personal stereo. With they lyrics, her face grew from concerned to downright livid. After hearing enough, she stormed into her room, and slammed the door.<p>Akane poked her head out of her room, wondering how Nabiki got so ticked off so quickly. She approached the guestroom door, and listened in on it. Akane wasn't anywhere near as good as her sister was with English, particularly with slang, but she had an inkling the song Ranma was listening to was what set her off...<p>"My Bad, I shoulda treated you like the Skank you are,<br/>Instead of having you ride on up in my car.<br/>If I had stuck to my original plan,<br/>You would be a one-night stand..."<p>Nabiki realized Akane was onto something here; hitting things was very therapeutic. Akane walked into the dojo, to find her sister in a pair of bicycle shorts and a sportsbra, pounding on the bananna bag that hung mostly unused in the corner.<p>"What's going on between you and Ranma?" Akane asked, after her sister stopped for a slight pause.<p>Nabiki turned to glare at her sister, before going back to working on the bag with a series of punches and kicks, "As far as I'm concerned, nothing is going on between me and Ranma. You or Kasumi can have him, for all I care!" Akane noted Nabiki's attacks were groing stronger as she talked.<p>"It has something to do with last night, doesn't it?" Akane asked, "Did you ever find him, then?"<p>Nabiki didn't turn back to her sister, "Like it matters, I'm not in the wrong, here!"<p>"Then why are you trying so hard to get back in his good graces?"<p>"I'm NOT trying to get in his good graces!" Nabiki snarled, "I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!"<p>"Ah... okay," akane placated, staring at her sister's fist, which was being held through what was left of the large punching bag; she just knew her father was going to blame her for this.<p>"Uh..." Nabiki retracted her fist, and stared at the shattered bag in awe, "Did I do that?"<p>"Nabiki, I know I'm probably not the person to be talking to about this," Akane started, "but I think you might... want to try harder to get back with him? I mean you're getting pretty upset about this."<p>Nabiki let out a sigh, "Look, he doesn't even want to listen to me, so I can at least explain myself. If he's going to be such a hypocritical asshole, then I don't care about this whole thing... I need something else to hit."<p>"Yeah, you really don't care," Akane drolled, already knowing that the smaller bag was going to need replacing soon.<p>"Ranma?" Kasumi let herself in, and found Ranma lounging on his bedding, just staring at the ceiling.<p>"Hey, sup, Kasumi?"<p>"Is there something going on between you and Nabiki? She wouldn't tell me." Kasumi kneeled at Ranma's side, and twisted her hair nervously.<p>Ranma gave her a glance, before turning to look back at the ceiling, "Na, nothing's between us. Not anymore, anyways."<p>"Oh my, why did you two break up? You made such a cute couple," Kasumi placed her hands on her lap, awaiting an answer.<p>"She's just too spiteful for me. I ain't gonna deal with shit like that."<p>"What did she do?"<p>"I caught her last night under the punk that was trying to get on my ass last night," Ranma continued, feeling a little better about getting it out in the open to someone.<p>Kasumi grew a puzzled expression, "Oh my, that doesn't sound like Nabiki at all!"<p>"Well, I saw it, I ain't going to argue with it."<p>"I think you may have it all wrong," Kasumi continued, "Nabiki wouldn't do anything like that. If anything, she's always loyal, even to those she's upset with." Kasumi flinched to herself after realizing what she said.<p>"Well, she didn't seem that loyal to me. Damn, and she was on my case about you and the thug!"<p>Kasumi sighed in a resigned tone, before gaining a slight smile. She shifted herself to lay on Ranma's chest, her breast pressing into his body, while she looked him in the eyes, "Then, I guess this means it's truly over between you and Nabiki?"<p>She leaned down to kiss Ranma, and pouted when he turned his head away with a sullen expression, "I guess."<p>Kasumi studied his expression for a moment, before her smile came back. She sat back up to seiza, and patted Ranma a couple of times on his stomach, "I think you should go talk to her, and hear her side of the story. You'll regret if if you don't."<p>Ranma turned to look back at Kasumi, before sitting up, "Shit, I probably won't get any sleep over this until this drama is resolved." With that, Ranma got up, and left the room.<p>Kasumi watched him leave, before bowing her head with her eyes closed, and shaking it, "too much drama between you two."<p>Akane stook anxiously at the doorway, while Nabiki was kneeling over a pile of bricks, and readying her blade chop. Akane couldn't recall the last time Nabiki had practiced breaking bricks, but her sister insisted on it, since she had ran out of things to hit. Ranma walked in, and saw Nabiki concentrating intently on what she was about to do, before turning to Akane.<p>The youngest girl turned, and raised her eyebrows to Ranma. She quickly approached the door to talk to him, but he waived her off gently. Akane understood, and nodded, before walking out.<p>"OW! DAMN IT!" Nabiki shot to standing, cradling her bruised edge of her hand, before she caught sight of Ranma, "Ra-Ranma!"<p>Ranma had his shades on, but Nabiki could feel the intensity of his stare, "What were you doing with Ryoga last night?"<p>Nabiki shivered at his tone, but wanted to look him in the eyes before she said anything. She briskly walked up to him, and with her pained hand cradled to her chest, she used her free hand to remove his sunglasses. The hardened and intense eyes that were behind them almost caused Nabiki to start crying right then and there, as they were devoid of any warm emotion.<p>She reinforced herself, focusing on her hurt hand for focus. Through gritted teeth, Nabiki seethed in anger, "I was trying to rip his damn balls off, right when you walked in!"<p>Ranma's eyes lost the diamond hardness, as he blinked in confusion. The confusion didn't last long, "Wait a sec, you mean to tell me that he was..."<p>Nabiki stepped back, as Ranma's expression became ten times as intense as she had ever seen it. As much as she disliked the other guy, she feared what would happen if Ranma got ahold of him, "Ranma, it was an accident. He just tripped over me, but I'm not all that happy with him right now, either."<p>Ranma bowed his head, and then looked back up to Nabiki. She felt lightheaded to see a soft smile cross his face, "I believe ya. I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions."<p>It was Nabiki's turn to be angry, "You're damn right you should be sorry! You had me worried, and you had pulled the same DAMN thing with my sis- ow!" Nabiki attempted to jab Ranma with her index finger on her right hand, which incidentally was the one she had hurt. Ranma gently grabbed her hand by the wrist, pulled the edge to his mouth, and lightly kissed it. he then pulled her hand around his neck, and brought both his own around her waist. The two scooted closer, finally making up.
