</div>Ranma; Just Plain Hard<p>"You're not upset about that?" Nabiki asked with a concerned expression... concerned for her sister.<p>Ranma continued searching the school grounds, until he found what he was looking for. He replied after a few moments, albeit slightly distracted, "Told ya, it's cool. She was just look'n to vent, no skin off my ass."<p>"So you're not gonna gun my sister down?" Nabiki asked with a hopeful tone.<p>"Huh?" Ranma put the object into his pocket, and turned towards Nabiki. Even with his glasses on, Nabiki could see a puzzled expression on his face.<p>"Well, as long as you're not really mad at her," Nabiki stated with some relief, "but let's get back home so I can take a look at your cheek and put some ice on it, I don't want my man wearing the mark of another woman."<p>"Yo, you head on out and I'll meet up with ya in a minnit. I gotta take care of some shit, kay?" At that, Ranma walked off the school grounds, leaving Nabiki to stare behind him, now wearing her own puzzled expression.<p>"Kasumi?"<p>The elder Tendou sister sighed, as she looked at the spilled meal on the floor, and then turned her concerned expression back to her youngest sister, "Akane-chan, your hair..."<p>"Um, just a little accident at school, that's all. Do you think you can even it out for me? I think it's time for a change, anyway."<p>But... but you've been growing it out for so long!"<p>"Yeah, but..." Akane thought about how her crush on Tofu wasn't really there anymore after... Ranma, "I think shorter hair will make me look more mature."<p>"Um, if you're okay with it, Akane-chan..." Kasumi replied with a slightly unnerved tone.<p>"Not much we can do about it, now," Akane replied nonchilantly, and then handed her sister a pair of scissors.<p>Ranma stared at the canal, before reaching into her pocket, and pulling out the object that he had been searching for earlier.<p>Ryoga's gun.<p>Ranma stared at the lethal and illegal weapon in her hands, considering the sources Ryoga had to use to get one. The Yakuza tattoo he now wore also told her exactly how far Ryoga was willing to go in his revenge. She was going to have to watch her back more, from now on.<p>The pigtailed martial artist considered the fact that Ryoga at least won't have this, at least, and tossed the gun into the canal. She leaned over the rail, watching the ripples from where the gun had sunk down and dissappeared. Even if it were recovered, it was now ruined, at least.<p>"Pretty deep part of the canal, I don't think it ever drains," Ranma quickly turned to Nabiki's voice, more than a little startled to find her there.<p>Her eyebrows lowered in irritation, "I thought I told you to go home."<p>Nabiki just shrugged, "Yeah, but I wasn't listening."<p>"Whatever," Ranma replied, "let's head on out. I'm done here."<p>"You're not using all that irritating slang," Nabiki commented idly, and glanced sideways to see Ranma's eyebrows raise, and then lower again. She noted he was irritated, but her lips didn't go into that straight line that meant she was angry, "You actually sound like a model addition to society, instead of a delinquent."<p>"Yo, if yo gonna be like this..." Ranma braced herself to leap away.<p>"Wait..." Nabiki requested, surprisingly finding Ranma complying, "That gun, why did you toss it away?"<p>"Piece is probably marked, ain't no use to me," Ranma commented idly, keeping her eyes straight to the path.<p>"You sure?" Nabiki asked, shyly, "That's not what I think."<p>"Whateva."<p>"I think you were concerned about what would happen if someone got that gun before you did, and not just Ryoga. I think you were worried about people here!"<p>"Shit, I don't give a damn about the peeps here. I gots my own problems, they can handle their own."<p>"Heh, so Saotome's not as hard as he... er, she likes to pretend." Nabiki almost giggled at the frown Ranma's face formed, "You know? You actually look pretty cute when you pout like that."<p>Ranma didn't say a word, as she leapt to the rooftops, and back to the Tendou household. "WAIT! RANMA! I'M SORRY, REALLY!" Nabiki shouted after the redhead, trying in vain to hide the humor from her tone. She gave up, and rolled her eyes; who would have ever thought that a self-proclaimed 'G' would be so damn sensitive?<p>Ryoga was now past the shivers stage, and went into the paranoia phase. As he looked around for 'those' who were watching him, he continued to search for something that was currently more valuable than anything ever could be to him. For something that covered a damn three-forths of the damn planet, the shit was sure hard as HELL for him to find when he *really* needed it. At least it was easier to find, and much safer, than his *other* solution.<p>"R-R-Ranma..." Ryoga stuttered, his teeth chattering to much that it was making it difficult to speak even partially, "I-I'll g-g-get y-you f-f-f-for th-this... WHERE IS THE DAMN COLD WATER?"<p>Ranma sat on the roof of a random building she came to a stop on. Nabiki had to go and say something like that, didn't she? The pigtailed martial artist's curse already irritated the hell out of her enough, she didn't want to have to deal with being 'cute' on top of it.<p>Ranma sighed, as she shifted to lean her back against a low wall that bordered the roof; she had to admit, it was better than being an ugly girl, at least. Still, she wasn't going to enjoy it. She was supposed to be a man, straight up, no doubt, not some red-headed trick that has every fucka Jones'n for her ass. Ranma had to smirk in after-thought; Nabiki called her cute, she swing that way too?<p>Ranma's smirk deepened; looks like both of them got something to be clown'n on the other about.<p>"I'm back!" Nabiki called out, as she entered her home.<p>"Welcome home, Nabiki," Kasumi called out, "Dinner is going to be a bit delayed, I'm afraid. Do you know what happened to Akane at school today?"<p>"Uh, she pushed me out of the way of a flying razor sharp bandanna, and accidentally got her hair caught in the way," Nabiki explained, "Is she okay?"<p>"I... believe so, she's out in the dojo, practicing right now," Kasumi replied, "You're not still mad at us, um, her?" Nabiki jolted at the reminder.<p>"Have you seen Ranma around?" Nabiki asked with a tight voice, not turning back to look at her sister.<p>"N-no," Kasumi stuttered, a bit startled that her sister was still upset with her, not that she didn't have ample reason to be.<p>"I'm going to be up in my room, then," Nabiki marched upstairs. Though it wasn't a slam, Kasumi noted that her door closing was sure audible enough.<p>"Oh my, I guess I'm going to have to do a great deal of kissing up..."<p>Ranma landed back in the Tendou's back yard, and heard the noises coming from the dojo. She walked in, expecting to find the thug that slugged her for something she didn't do, not that she was gonna be sweat'n that tap, tho', "Hey, Akane, where..." Ranma-chan's eyebrows raised at the sight of the cute short-haired girl that was training in the dojo, "H-hold up, hold up." As smooth as she could manage, Ranma rolled on up by the girl, staring at him curiously, "Lemme hollar at you for a minnit..."<p>"Isn't that what got us into trouble with Nabiki?" the girl stated with an almost forlorned sigh, "and you kind of lose the effect by being a girl, you know?"<p>"Oh, snap! I forgot!" Ranma almost shouted, realizing she was still a girl. She then paused, and looked back at the other girl, "Yo... 'Kane, dat you?"<p>Akane nodded in reply, amused that Ranma hadn't recognized her until now, "Yeah, had to have my hair evened out after earlier."<p>"Hey, looks good on ya. Makes you look like less of a thug! A bit younger, tho'."<p>Akane's eye twitched at the middle of the compliment, but dismissed it, "I was hoping it'll make me look a bit older. I always thought long hair made me seem to young."<p>Ranma-chan smirked at Akane's pout, and then considered something, "Yo, hold a sec..." She pulled a bandanna from her back pocket, the one that her mentor in the art of being 'Hard' gave her when she 'graduated' from his 'school'. She motioned the curious Akane to turn around, and tied it onto her head. After she was done, Akane felt the bandanna on the top of her head, staring at the redhead with a puzzled expression.<p>"There, now you still look like the cute lil' thug you are, but not so damn young, 'aight?"<p>"Um, I guess I'll take that as a compliment.." Akane replied with a half-lidded stare.<p>Ranma went up Nabiki's room with intentions of psyching up the girl who thought it was funny to call her 'cute'. Ranma was still in girl form, and wearing one of her older windbreaker outfits from when she was younger that fit his girl side somewhat tightly, but better than his others. The redhead twisted the door knob, to find the door locked. "Yo, Nabiki, I wanna talk with ya for a bit..."<p>"Not right now," Nabiki's voice was somewhat antarctic in temperature. Ranma-chan took the hint, wondering what the Hell was her problem, and why she was taking it out on her ass. She just wanted to talk!<p>Ranma had seen the middle Tendou sister at dinner, but found her remarkably quiet. Deciding that tonight wasn't the night to mess with her, Ranma changed himself back into a guy, and headed up to the guestroom for the night. Several hours later, an uninvited guest made his way into her room, not quite sure how he did it, but was somewhat glad for it.<p>"Ranma... wake up..." Ryoga whispered. He started to get anxious when there was no responce, and moved his hands forward to shake the pigtailed young man, "Hey, Ranma, I..."<p>::CLICK::<p>"Bad enough you attack my ass without warning, you gonna botha a nigga in his sleep?" Ranma almost growled, holding his gun to Ryoga's forehead. The bandanna wearing boy didn't even seem to notice the gun.<p>"Ranma, I need a hit! Y-you know I'm good for it! Help me out, w-will ya?"<p>Ranma blinked at the question.
