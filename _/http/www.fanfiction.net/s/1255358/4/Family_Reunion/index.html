It has<br/>been three weeks since the incident with Kuno and Ryoga and already it was long<br/>forgotten. Ranma started training with Katsuhito and Tenchi up at the shrine to<br/>learn how to use his powers properly. Akane had gone up to the shrine to take<br/>the men some fresh tea when she witnessed that power in action. She left quite<br/>awed and a bit frightened at the same time. Ranma was far stronger than she<br/>could have ever begun to imagine.<br/>The youngest of the three Tendo sisters wasn't dwelling on that right now.<br/>Wrapped in her pink towel she just relaxed in the warm waters of the onsen and<br/>allowed the harmonious sound of flowing water sooth her. Nearby Ryoko and<br/>Nabiki, both totally naked, sat together sipping tea and saki. Sasami and<br/>Kasumi giggled and laughed just enjoying each other's company. Little Ryo-Ohki<br/>was as always on top of the little princess's head. Aeka and Washu sat next to<br/>Akane sharing some saki also.<br/>"This place is so wonderful, I wish we had one in Nerima." Akane said<br/>lazily.<br/>"That could be arranged." Washu replied after downing her fifth saucer of<br/>saki. "I looked into an alternate universe once and there I was, my alternate<br/>self, creating a onsen inside of Tenchi's bathroom using a bubble in subspace<br/>just like the way I made my lab." She went on.<br/>"Wow, really." Said an astonished Akane.<br/>"You'll have to clear it with dad first." Said Nabiki.<br/>"Ryoko is the one who made this one." Aeka told her.<br/>Akane looked over at the cyan haired beauty in surprise. "You did?" she<br/>asked. "Yep, wasn't hard at all either." Ryoko grinned.<br/>"It was the only thing she has ever done that I can honestly say I approve<br/>of." Said Aeka. Ryoko narrowed her eyes and grumbled, "What was that,<br/>Princess?"<br/>"Lets change the subject." said Washu, hoping to keep the two from<br/>fighting. "How about we play a little game." She suggested. "I love games."<br/>Kasumi smiled. "Me too." Sasami said cheerfully.<br/>"This game is called 'Kiss and Tell'," Washu told them. "You go 'first'<br/>Akane." The diminutive genius gives her a knowing wink. Akane quickly turned a<br/>deep shade of red.<br/>"Do you know something we don't know, Little Washu?" Nabiki asked, a coy<br/>smile on her lips.<br/>"Oh, I'm going to leave that up to Akane to explain." Giggled Washu.<br/>Akane looked at her middle sister helplessly and sighed. "There isn't<br/>much to talk about really." She said. "I doubt that." Smiled Washu as wide as a<br/>Cheshire cat. "Fess up Akane." Nabiki said, the curiosity was starting to<br/>become too much for her. "Yeah, lets here all the 'gory' details." Ryoko<br/>laughed.<br/>"We just kissed, ok." Akane said quickly.<br/>"You know Akane you couldn't lie to save your life." Nabiki sighed.<br/>The others all broke out into laughter. "Well, it-it was beautiful<br/>actually," Akane finally said. "I felt this tingling starting in my toes, it<br/>went up my back, and I felt like I was soaring high in the air."<br/>"Yep, she's in love." Said Washu.<br/>"We kissed again, deeper this time, more forceful, it was incredible,"<br/>Akane went on. "My heart felt like it was going to explode, I didn't want to<br/>leave Ranma's arms, didn't want it to stop." All the while Akane's face grew<br/>ever redder until she was the color of a radish. "We couldn't stop ourselves,<br/>didn't want to stop, we kissed again and again and again, everything was a blur,<br/>and then-and then-" she cried to continued but to too overcome with emotion.<br/>"What, and then what?" everyone asked, all poised for the answer.<br/>"I can't believe you're making me say this," Akane said embarrassed. "And<br/>then-and then we-we-we MADE LOVE, IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL!" Unable to handle the<br/>embracement anymore Akane dunked down under the water. Everyone but Washu<br/>gasped in shock, Kasumi and Nabiki's eyes were as wide as bowling balls.<br/>"Oh my god, you didn't!" Nabiki explained in disbelief. "No with Ranma!"<br/>Akane came back up out of the water in time to hear her. She nodded<br/>saying, "We did, in Washu's lab right after what happened with Kuno and Ryoga,<br/>you could say it was motivated by what happened that day but I have no regrets."<br/>"So that's why you two are so 'lovidovey' all of a sudden." Ryoko giggled.<br/>Ryoko's laughter echoed off the translucent onsen dome and she slapped her<br/>hands. "You owe me five thousand yen when we get back to the house, girly<br/>girl." She said to Nabiki. "Damn." The middle Tendo sister sighed.<br/>"Wah!" a shocked Akane remarked. "Do you mean to tell me the two of you<br/>made a bet on this!" she exclaimed.<br/>"Yeah, and I lost, I never imagined in a million years you and Ranma would<br/>actually ever do the 'dirty deed'." Nabiki replied laughing.<br/>"Nabiki!" exclaimed Akane.<br/>"Do you 'really' love him, Akane?" Nabiki asked.<br/>"Of course she does." Said Ryoko.<br/>Akane blushed furiously and covered her face. "Three weeks ago I would<br/>have said 'no', but now I can't deny what's in my heart, what I've felt for a<br/>long time actually." She said. "I guess you can say I do 'love' Ranma."<br/>"It will be wonderful now the two of you won't be fighting anymore."<br/>Kasumi cooed.<br/>"You and Ranma used to fight, but you were engaged." Aeka said to the<br/>young Tendo sister astonished. "Yeah, well it was an arrangement between our<br/>parents, as I said before," she replied. "And, my two sisters sort of nominated<br/>me for it too if I remember."<br/>"Better you than me." Nabiki laughed.<br/>"So what now?" asked Sasami.<br/>Akane turned to the little girl intending to reply. Her gaze feel on the<br/>cute little princess, but then traveled down to her reflection in the water and<br/>she gasped in shock. The younger Tendo sister stood up and nearly fell<br/>backwards into the water.<br/>"Oh my god!" she cried pointing at Sasami.<br/>"Huh?" everyone said at once and turned to where she was pointing. Nabiki<br/>and Kasumi noticed immediately. "Oh my goodness." Kasumi gasped. "Is this<br/>another one of those 'alien' things?" asked Nabiki. After living in the Tendo<br/>house most of her life and seeing all manner of weird things she wasn't shocked<br/>in the slightest.<br/>Sasami looked down at herself and was met by the smiling face of<br/>'Tsunami'. The Goddess was adorned in her regal robes. Seeing Sasami looking<br/>down at her she blinked playfully. The little princess tried to suppress her<br/>giggle but it came out anyway.<br/>"Maybe its time we told them about Sasami." Said Ryoko. "And me."<br/>"Told us what, what's happening to her?" Akane asked, now in full control<br/>of her composure.<br/>"I'll field this one Aeka." offered Washu. The elder princess nodded to<br/>her with a smile. After all, Washu was the best qualified person to tell the<br/>tale, from her prison on the Soja she witness the attack on Jurai through<br/>Ryoko's eyes.<br/>"It all starts about five thousand years ago," Washu started. "I was a<br/>professor at the Galactic Science Academy, I had a brilliant student named<br/>Kagato and he assisted me in what was to be one of my most spectacular projects<br/>yet." Ryoko pointed to herself and said, "I was that project." The Tendo<br/>sisters looked at her in surprise. "That's right," Washu went on. "Ryoko was<br/>engineered by me, I used one of my ova combined with the Masu, and it's the same<br/>way I made Ryo-Ohki except with mineral life and the Masu." An astonished Akane<br/>then asked, "What does that have to do with Sasami?" "I'm getting to that."<br/>Washu replied a bit frustrated at being interrupted. "I am not sure where,<br/>when, or how but something got to Kagato, a darkness or some kind of evil." She<br/>said continuing the tale. "It began to consume him from within, soon most of<br/>his body became incorporeal. He betrayed me one day, tricked me and locked me<br/>up inside of my own starship the Soja and on top of that he took control of my<br/>Little Ryoko's mind. He forced her to do unspeakable things in the name of his<br/>quest for ultimate power, soon he became obsessed with discovering the source of<br/>the power controlled by the Jurai Royal Family; Tsunami."<br/>"Sasami mentioned that name three weeks ago." Kasumi remembered.<br/>"Tsunami is the Tree of Light, the mother of all the royal trees of Jurai,<br/>the sentient trees that function as the heart of all the ships from our world."<br/>Aeka explained. "All members of the Jurai royal family are eventually called on<br/>by the trees and are bonded with the one who called them. The bond forms a<br/>symbiotic relationship between the two allowing telepathic communication, and in<br/>return the person bonded is granted an immensely extended lifespan. Sasami at a<br/>young age was called upon by Tsunami, and you can just imagine that this news<br/>was a tremendous shock to the other royal houses."<br/>"Kagato learned that Tsunami was the source of the Jurai power and wanted<br/>to learn how to use it himself, so he sent Ryoko to attack Jurai intending to<br/>steel the tree." Washu continued. "But, Aeka's half-brother Yosho, whom you<br/>know as Katsuhito, fought Ryoko off and chased her here to Earth where he<br/>defeated her and sealed her up in a cave for seven hundred years until one day<br/>Tenchi accidentally set her free."<br/>"That's an amazing tale." Said Kasumi.<br/>"What happened with Sasami occurred during the battle on Jurai." Washu<br/>explained. "She was very young at the time, about 4 or 5 or so. She wandered<br/>off from her nanny and went to the royal hanging gardens where the trees of<br/>Jurai and Tsunami dwell. She was making her way along the platforms when<br/>something hit the tower and exploded. The force knocked her off her feet and<br/>she fell to her death. Saddened at the loss of her bond mate, Tsunami generated<br/>a 'copy' of Sasami. They are joined together, so that is why you can see<br/>Tsunami's reflection."<br/>"That's absolutely incredible." Akane gasped.<br/>Sasami climbed up out of the water. "I'd better go, I have to start<br/>dinner." She said. "I'll come and help you in a little bit." Kasumi called<br/>after her. The little princess smiled and giggled, "Ok." "Bye." Waves Akane.<br/>The little girl smiles and waves back as she goes through the main door.<br/>When Sasami was gone Washu turned to the Tendo girls with a serious look<br/>on her face. "With Sasami here I couldn't tell you the real truth because even<br/>she doesn't know." She told them. "What truth?" Nabiki asked. "That 'she' is<br/>the 'real' Sasami, she only 'thinks' she's a copy." Washu said pointing towards<br/>the onsen entrance where Sasami had gone. "After the fall Sasami was barely<br/>hanging onto life when Tsunami, in an ultimate gesture of her love, sacrificed<br/>her individuality so that Sasami could live." Explained Aeka.<br/>"What does that mean?" Kasumi asked, confused.<br/>"Tsunami and Sasami are assimilated, they aren't two different people<br/>anymore, they are the 'same' person." Washu informed them. "For now they have<br/>separate minds to allow Sasami to have her childhood, but one day they will<br/>fully merge and become one mind, one body, one personality, and have a complete<br/>combined memory."<br/>Akane gasped in complete shock, "Is that possible?"<br/>"It is, when you are a 'goddess'." Aeka told her. Now this had a major<br/>effect, all the Tendo sisters looked like they were about to faint. "Tsunami is<br/>a goddess, one of three sisters." Said Washu. "I am one of them, or was before<br/>I gave up my immortality to be human about twenty thousand year ago, and the<br/>third is no longer with us."<br/>"I'm so sorry." Kasumi said sadly.<br/>"Don't be, Tokimi was evil through and through," said Aeka. "She tried to<br/>kill us and destroy Jurai, and none of us would be here if Tenchi hadn't<br/>destroyed her."<br/>"This is just getting better and better, first aliens and now goddesses."<br/>Nabiki sighed. Ryoko handed her a small saki bottle. Nabiki accepted it and<br/>took a long swig. "Welcome to the family." Ryoko smiled.<br/>"Hold up, you said Yosho was Aeka and Sasami's half-brother." Said Akane.<br/>"Yes, we have the same father but two different mothers." Aeka replied.<br/>Akane sighed, "We lost our mother, but dad never remarried."<br/>"Oh, Yosho's mother is still alive and so is mine and Sasami's." Aeka<br/>explained.<br/>"Was there a divorce?" asked Kasumi.<br/>Aeka laughed, "There is 'much' you must learn of the Royal Family of<br/>Jurai."<br/>"You mean your father has two wives!" Akane gasped.<br/>Aeka nodded, "As the King of Jurai he may have as many wives as he<br/>pleases, and the same privilege extends to Lord Tenchi and Lord Ranma if they so<br/>choose." The Tendo sisters all looked at the First Princess with an expression<br/>of immense surprise. "In fact, as members of the direct line of succession to<br/>the throne, the royal family expects nothing less." She added. Akane grabbed<br/>the saki bottle from Nabiki's hand and drained the last of it in one gulp, today<br/>was just full of incredible revelations.<p>Ranma was running, very fast. The trees were going by in a blur, the air<br/>was pushing back his hair, yet he didn't feel tired at all. For three weeks<br/>he'd been training with Katsuhito and Tenchi at the shrine learning to harness<br/>the Jurai power he had within him. Now he was learning to use that power, and<br/>it felt incredible. Ranma was fast, his hands had always been quick, whether he<br/>was throwing out punches or moving rice from one plate to another like on Prince<br/>Toma's island. Yet, the awesome speed he was at right now was far beyond that.<br/>It was almost as if he was 'super-human'.<br/>Tenchi wasn't too far behind. The boy ran with a similar speed, tapping<br/>into his immense pool of energy. There was a strange glow surrounding the First<br/>Prince of Jurai as he ran. Ranma remembered Tenchi said that ever since the war<br/>with Lady Tokimi he'd been able to call upon the Light Hawk Wings whenever he<br/>wanted to. With the wings he was able to do virtually anything, and right now<br/>he was keeping up with Ranma using that power. The young Saotome suspected that<br/>was just the tip of the iceberg though.<br/>Katsuhito stood as still as an old oak tree. He held a stopwatch in his<br/>hand as it counted down. The two cousins came racing by, the wind from their<br/>passing sent up a huge cloud of dust and made the trees sway back and forth.<br/>The old priest's robes flew around, but the old man didn't move an inch. The<br/>shockwave in the air reached the porch of the shrine sending the wind chimes<br/>into a frantic dance and knocking over several baskets.<br/>"Hmmm, not bad." Said the old man.<br/>The cousins came around again completing another circuit. Katsuhito<br/>clicked the stopwatch and the two came to a sudden halt. When they stopped they<br/>created a shockwave in the air that pushed the trees in one direction sending<br/>them swaying again.<br/>"That was totally awesome!" shouted Ranma.<br/>"What would you say we were we doing, grandpa?" Tenchi asked.<br/>"I'd say you two were doing a good sixty to eighty miles per hour or so."<br/>The old priest said.<br/>"That fast, WOW!" exclaimed Ranma, he was beginning to love this whole<br/>alien thing.<br/>"I am certain you can go much faster," Katsuhito told him. "Tenchi with<br/>the Light Hawk Wings can fly at speeds exceeding the speed of sound."<br/>Ranma felt a cold draft all of a sudden and looked down at his outfit. It<br/>was nearly torn to shreds, and his shoes were practically gone. "It's murder on<br/>my wardrobe though." He said. "Once you learn to project a force field in front<br/>of you and use it to fly that won't be a problem anymore." The old priest said.<br/>Suddenly, Katsuhito felt a presence nearby. He cursed himself for letting<br/>his defenses down, who or whatever it was wasn't very far away. He jerked<br/>around quickly as a blue and red form suddenly streaked out of the underbrush<br/>and advanced on Ranma. The old priest didn't make a move however, he could<br/>clearly see what it was advancing on his grandson, and what he saw made him do<br/>an eyebrow Spock Maneuver.<br/>"Nihao, Ranma!" the figure cried as it threw its arms around the suddenly<br/>stunned young Saotome.<br/>"S-S-S-Shampoo!" Ranma stammered.<br/>Much of Japan and the Orient was once a colony of planet Jurai. Juraian<br/>culture had a major influence in shaping the cultures and traditions of the<br/>Japanese and Chinese peoples. Tenchi recalled that Washu suggested that a<br/>little more than sixty percent of the population in Japan and China had some<br/>Juraian blood, but not necessarily 'royal' blood. The girl clinging to Ranma<br/>was to say the least absolutely gorgeous, a vision of beauty who could easily<br/>rival the girls Tenchi lived with. Her delicate features gave away her origins,<br/>she was definitely Chinese, but her blue hair also cued Tenchi in to the fact<br/>that she had some Juraian blood in her veins. Her hair style was slightly<br/>similar to Aeka's and Akane's, her long bangs were tied with little red bows,<br/>and her hair hung down low below her waist in a long braid that ended in a large<br/>bow. She was wearing a tight red outfit with a flower print that was definitely<br/>of Chinese make.<br/>"Shampoo see whole thing, Ranma so strong, so manly." The girl cooed,<br/>hugging Ranma lovingly. The boy, however, wasn't so happy to have such a<br/>gorgeous creature glomping him. "Shampoo, let go, what are you doing here!"<br/>Ranma shouted as he tried to pry himself loose.<br/>"Poor Ranma must spend whole summer with baka Akane, Shampoo come to save<br/>man she love." She replied while rubbing her cheek against his.<br/>Something silver, reflecting the light of the sun, suddenly flew passed<br/>Tenchi and Katsuhito. Neither moved an inch as the object slapped the Chinese<br/>girl in the face sending her falling to the ground. Tenchi looked at the fallen<br/>object in surprise, it was a-spatula?<br/>"I'm the one Ranma honey truly loves." Said a new voice, a firm but gentle<br/>feminine tone.<br/>"U-Ukyo?" Ranma said, dumbfounded. "Both of you are here."<br/>This new girl was dressed in the uniform robe of an Okinomiaki chef.<br/>Slung over her back was a gigantic spatula, and she wore a bandoleer that held<br/>several more of the smaller metal utensils. Her black tights revealed the<br/>wonderfully elegant curvature of her long legs, her black hair hung down to her<br/>waist and was held back by a white bow. Like the Chinese girl she too was<br/>incredibly beautiful. Tenchi looked back and forth between his cousin and the<br/>two girls. He nervously scratched his head and sighed, "It must run in the<br/>family somewhere."<p>Akane felt incredibly refreshed after the visit to the onsen. She loved<br/>the place and hoped her dad would allow Washu to make them one. She, her<br/>sisters, Aeka, Mihoshi, Washu, and Ryoko walked back towards the house. They<br/>passed close to where the stairs to the shrine started, and Ryoko noticed some<br/>people coming down. She teleported away, then materialized just behind Tenchi<br/>and glomped him. "Hello, my Tenchi." She whispered seductively into his ear.<br/>"Hey, Ryoko get off will ya!" Tenchi groaned.<br/>"Ryoko, let Lord Tenchi go this instant!" Aeka shouted.<br/>Ryoko laughed, "Make me, your worshipfulness."<br/>Despite the distance Tenchi's keen eyes could clearly see the veins<br/>popping up on Aeka's forehead. "Oh no." he sighed knowing a fight was<br/>inevitable.<br/>"Girls, show some manners, we have new guests." Katsuhito said defusing<br/>the situation. Thank Kami-san for grandpa, Tenchi thought.<br/>"Ukyo, Shampoo what are you two doing in Ohkayama?" Akane asked when she<br/>recognized the two women. "You know them?" asked Aeka.<br/>"We came because we decided not to wait any longer." Said Ukyo. "That<br/>right, we wait long enough." Shampoo added.<br/>"Waited for what?" Ryoko asked.<br/>"Either Ranma finally decides to choose who he wants to be with or we have<br/>a three way duel, winner take all." Said Ukyo as she pulled out her big spatula<br/>and points it at Akane.<br/>Ranma jumps in between them waving his arms shouting, "Hey, now wait a<br/>sec, there's something you two need to know!"<br/>"No more talk, you choose or Akane fights!" Shampoo shouted and stomped<br/>her foot.<br/>Tenchi leaned towards his grandfather and whispers, "Reminds you of a<br/>couple of somebody's doesn't it." The old man nodded in agreement.<br/>"I'm not gonna fight!" Akane exclaimed in reply. "Listen to what Ranma<br/>has to say!"<br/>"Perhaps the four of you should go and discuss this in private." Katsuhito<br/>suggested. "Right, lets go to Fonaho-Oh." Ranma said. "Fonaho-Oh?" Shampoo<br/>said curiously.<p>Tenchi watched the four of them walk off into the woods towards his<br/>grandfather's space tree. His keen senses amplified by his powers told him that<br/>there were many eyes on him at that moment. He turned to meet the gaze of the<br/>young women whom he shared his house with. They all looked at him expectantly,<br/>then he remembered what he said to them before Ranma and his family came.<br/>Tenchi sighed and said, "Ok, I guess it's about time we did the same, lets go up<br/>to the shrine." All of the girls nodded and followed him towards the stairs.<br/>"I will be at the house." Katsuhito said as he walked off. He showed no<br/>emotion, but inside he felt such incredible pride in his grandson, both of his<br/>grandsons.<p>Shampoo and Ukyo stared up in wonder at the magnificent tree. They were<br/>at a loss to determine what sort of tree it was, the trunk was certainly huge,<br/>the canopy of leaves and branches stretched out so far that it covered the<br/>entire pool it was growing in. Ranma had taken Akane here the day after they<br/>consummated their relationship in Washu's lab. Here, beneath the leaves, he<br/>pledged to love her forever. This place was very special to her heart.<br/>Ranma stopped and turned around to face them. Akane could read in his<br/>face signs of the conflict within. She was well aware of the truth in his<br/>heart, he loved her very much, but he also felt some attachment to Shampoo and<br/>Ukyo as well. She knew Ranma well, he was going to tell them about him and<br/>Akane, and she knew it was going to tear him up inside. Akane agreed, Ranma and<br/>Tenchi were both very much alike in this respect. Then, she remembered Aeka's<br/>words in the onsen. A part of her didn't like the idea, but her heart told her<br/>she had to tell him.<br/>"Ukyo, Shampoo, I brought all of you out here because-" Ranma began, but<br/>Akane walked up and interrupted him.<br/>"Ranma, I love you, and I'll accept any decision you choose to make." She<br/>told him. The other girls gasped at Akane's sudden admission of her feelings.<br/>"Akane?" a surprised Ranma said.<br/>"There is something Aeka told me you should know before you make that<br/>decision though, I don't like it, but my heart says to tell you and whatever you<br/>decide I will live with it because I will always love you and will never leave<br/>your side no matter what." She continued. The two other girls looked at each<br/>other with puzzled expressions.<br/>"What do you mean, what did she tell you?" Ranma asked.<p>Tenchi sat on the shrine steps flanked by the six women who were a part of<br/>his life. Ryoko had teleported to the house and grabbed Sasami out of the<br/>kitchen for this event. They all looked at him expectantly and with a little<br/>bit of fear. They could read it in his face, today was the day, he was going to<br/>choose and they all would have to live with his decision. After all, despite<br/>all the rivalry the final decision was always 'his' to make.<br/>"I want to start off by saying that I truly care about all of you, I once<br/>thought all I wanted was a normal ordinary life, but when I really think about<br/>it if I didn't have all of you here my life would be pretty bland." He told<br/>them.<br/>"We have had some interesting adventures haven't we." Said Ryoko.<br/>"Except for the war with Tokimi, that wasn't an adventure that was a<br/>living hell." Commented Washu.<br/>"I almost lost all of you in that war." Said Tenchi, his voice low now.<br/>"We almost lost you, Lord Tenchi." Said Aeka.<br/>Tenchi looked down at his hands and sighed. He knew what he had to do, he<br/>was torn between two worlds, two cultures. On one side was his Shinto<br/>upbringing, on the other was his Juraian heritage and all the rights and<br/>privileges he receives from it. It was impossible to deny that his destiny<br/>leaned towards his Juraian heritage now more than at any other time. Ever since<br/>the Goddess War the galaxy at large was infatuated with the young First Prince<br/>of Jurai. Despite the ill feelings the King of Jurai had for his great grandson<br/>there was no avoiding the fact that one day he would indeed succeed the throne.<br/>"I don't know what I would have done if I ever lost any one of you." He<br/>said. "I could never forgive myself."<br/>"Tenchi-" began Ryoko, but she stopped when her mother put a hand on her<br/>shoulder.<br/>"Choosing, I always knew, would be inevitable," Tenchi went on. "I also<br/>know that choosing will break the hearts of those who are not the one, and in<br/>turn that will tear me up inside knowing I caused that pain."<br/>Looks of confusion, surprise, and fear were exchanged between the girls.<br/>Tenchi noticed it, they were worried, but he decided to end all of their<br/>worrying now and forever. "So, I have decided not to choose," he said, the<br/>girls all gasped. "Just one." He finished with a smile. Their horrified<br/>expressions turned to surprise with a tinge of hope, had they heard him<br/>correctly?<br/>"It will be hard, it will be an adjustment for all of us, but I know we<br/>can make this work." He told them. "If you are all willing to try with me."<br/>Their eyes grew wide, he meant what he said, and effectively he opened the<br/>door for all of them into his heart. The girls were silent for a moment, which<br/>made Tenchi worry a bit. Would they accept, or would they all in a rage<br/>vaporize him into a pile of dust?<p>There, I did it I told him, now Ranma its all up to you, Akane said to<br/>herself. Ranma sat on the ground with the three girls. His face was an<br/>unreadable mask. What Akane just told him nearly blew his mind; as a Prince of<br/>Jurai and a member of the line of succession he could have as many wives as he<br/>wished. In fact, it was expected of him to do so. He couldn't bring himself to<br/>believe Akane agreed with that though, he could see it in her face, but he also<br/>knew she'd accept his wishes because she said so from her heart.<br/>"I don't know what to do." He admitted.<br/>Akane put her hand on his shoulder and told him, "Do what your heart<br/>says."<br/>Ukyo and Shampoo knew nothing of Ranma's alien heritage. All of this talk<br/>of him being a prince of someplace called Jurai was beyond them. What or where<br/>was this place called Jurai, they thought.<br/>"I don't want to hurt you." He told her truthfully.<br/>"What is this place called Jurai?" Ukyo asked, interrupting the two.<br/>Ranma and Akane both looked at her with a curious expression that made<br/>Ukyo do a Spock Maneuver. "That is a little hard to explain." Said Akane.<br/>"Ranma is Prince, but where is the Kingdom?" asked Shampoo.<br/>"You sure you two 'really' want to know?" Ranma asked.<br/>"Yes." Ukyo and Shampoo replied together.<br/>The young Saotome sighed, "Ok, here goes."<p>Tenchi didn't have to wait long for the girls to answer him. With tears<br/>streaming down their faces they surrounded him and held him in their arms.<br/>Mihoshi was balling pretty soon leaving a noise puddle. Tenchi tried to<br/>encircle them with his arms as best he could. Together they all cried, not out<br/>of sadness, but out of joy. The joy of a new beginning, a new start. Then, one<br/>my one Tenchi kissed them, but not like before. This time the kiss was on the<br/>lips, tender, passionate. Not to leave little Sasami out of the picture he gave<br/>her a quick kiss on the lips which made her blush furiously.<br/>"Well, what do we do now?" asked Washu.<br/>"Breed like rabbits." Said Ryoko.<br/>Tenchi turned bright red. "Besides that, but not a bad idea." Washu<br/>replied smiling.<br/>"Maybe we should take things easy for awhile, allow ourselves to get used<br/>to this 'new life'." Aeka suggested.<br/>Ryoko sighed, "Aeka's right, lets not rush into anything yet."<br/>"You agree with me?" Aeka asked her, astonished.<br/>"Yeah, why so surprised?" asked Ryoko.<br/>"Because we were all suspecting things would end up this way, that's why."<br/>Washu told them. "We all know Tenchi better than anybody, we should have seen<br/>this coming from a billion miles away."<br/>"Does this mean we're all going to be, well, Princesses?" Mihoshi asked.<br/>Aeka nodded, "Technically yes, after our eventual marriage to Lord<br/>Tenchi."<br/>"When I saw all of you prepared to give your lives for mine, I knew in my<br/>heart this was the only solution." Tenchi explained to them.<br/>"Well, it's a great solution in my book," replied Washu. "And besides,<br/>now I can get that 'sample'." She smiled at him like a Cheshire cat. "Does it<br/>all have to boil down to sex?" Tenchi sighed.<br/>"Damn straight!" Ryoko answered.<br/>"But none of us here would ever make love to anyone other than the man we<br/>love." Said Aeka with a slight blush on her cheeks.<br/>"Like my heart would belong to none other than the six of you." Tenchi<br/>replied.<p>Ukyo and Shampoo stared to Ranma, speechless. Thoughts raced through<br/>their heads. Ranma was part alien, and the member of the royal family of the<br/>most powerful empire in the galaxy. This knowledge was overwhelming to say the<br/>least.<br/>"This is true?" asked Shampoo.<br/>Ranma nodded, "It's true, my grandfather is a half-alien prince."<br/>"And your mother never knew any of this." Ukyo said.<br/>"No, not a soul has known until my cousin Tenchi encountered Ryoko and the<br/>others." Ranma explained.<br/>"Is all too incredible." Said Shampoo, still looking overwhelmed.<br/>"Look, Ukyo, Shampoo, I love Akane, and I care about the two of you-"<br/>Ranma began but Ukyo sat up and look him square in the eye.<br/>"Ranma I love you!" she admitted. "I love you so much it hurts inside!"<br/>"Ukyo-" Ranma gasped.<br/>Shampoo looked up, tears streaked her face. "Life have no meaning to<br/>Shampoo without Ranma, Shampoo no want to go on without him." She said with a<br/>shaking voice.<br/>Ranma was taken aback. He never imagined how deeply the two girls really<br/>felt about him. He knew Ukyo had a crush on him, but that was all he thought it<br/>was. And, he had always thought Shampoo's advanced were because of the law her<br/>tribe had that said she had to marry him because he defeated her in battle.<br/>"I-I-I need some time to think." Ranma said lowering his head.<br/>"This is a big decision for Ranma, we need to give him some space." Said<br/>Akane to the two women. The other two nodded in agreement.<br/>"Thank you." Said Ranma. Akane leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.<p>"You're going to marry all of them!" Nabiki said in total surprise.<br/>Tenchi smiled and nodded. He and the girls had made a grand entrance at<br/>the house. They were all practically hanging onto him as they came through the<br/>back door. Kasumi had asked what was going on and Tenchi made the announcement<br/>to the surprise of everyone in the house except for Katsuhito. Deep inside the<br/>old priest suspected that this sort of thing would happen one day. He wasn't at<br/>all disappointed with Tenchi for taking the easy way out of his situation.<br/>"Isn't that illegal?" she asked.<br/>"On Earth by Japanese law, yes, but not according to Juraian law." Aeka<br/>explained. "Therefore, our wedding will have to take place offworld."<br/>Tendo and Saotome had returned to the house after a long practice session<br/>outside. The two were beginning to take all of this much better. It was odd,<br/>Genma though, but he knew somehow deep inside that Ranma was meant for something<br/>great. He just wasn't expecting something like this.<br/>"Where is Ranma?" Genma asked.<br/>"He's up by the shrine with Akane and two girls who just showed up." Said<br/>Ryoko.<br/>"Who are the two girls?" Soun asked.<br/>"I think they said their names were Shampoo and Ukyo." Ryoko told him.<br/>The two men just looked at each other and at the same time they both said,<br/>"Uh ho." Ryoko shrugged her shoulders and handed them both a couple a cups of<br/>sake. "Don't worry, they went off alone to talk." She added.<br/>"You don't know how attached those two are to Ranma." Saotome said. "Some<br/>guys get all the luck." Tendo sighed.<br/>Aeka looked over at Tenchi and nodded, "Oh I can just imagine."<br/>Kasumi brought out a pitcher of fresh iced cinnamon tea and a snack tray<br/>that Sasami had made with crackers, cheese, little cold cuts and fresh<br/>vegetables with dip. The girls sat with Tenchi on the couch not wanting to part<br/>with him for a while and were still glowing from the surprise he gave them up at<br/>the shrine.<br/>"I'll be graduating high school soon," said Tenchi. "So I've been<br/>applying to different colleges and universities."<br/>"Doesn't that mean you'd have to move away for a while?" Mihoshi asked.<br/>Tenchi nodded. "It's not like I'll be gone forever, and I'm sure a<br/>certain someone here can figure out a way for us to still see each other." He<br/>was looking at Washu when he said that. The diminutive genius laughed and<br/>smiled, "I may have something that could help with that sort of situation."<br/>"What college might you attend?" Washu asked Tenchi.<br/>"Well, I've gotten letters of acceptance from the Nekomi Institute of<br/>Technology, Fujimitsu University in Tokyo, and the Isakawa University of<br/>Technology in Nerima." He said.<br/>"Isakawa has a great architecture program." Kasumi said.<br/>"Oh?" said Tenchi in response. "Yes, I have a friend who goes there, and<br/>her brother is taking architecture classes there." Kasumi continued.<br/>"And you're welcome to stay with us if you want." Tendo offered.<br/>"Thanks, but I'm still thinking about where I want to go." Tenchi told<br/>him.<br/>Tendo smiled and replied, "Well, the offer still stands if you decide to<br/>come to Nerima."<p>Ranma threw a flat stone skipping it off the surface of the lake. He sat<br/>on top of a small boulder that sat at the waters edge. Far across the lake he<br/>could see the Masaki home and the mountain where the family shrine was. In the<br/>distance the very top of the great tree Fonaho-oh peeked over the other trees in<br/>the valley. The young Saotome sighed, he didn't know what to do. He could tell<br/>Akane did not like the idea of having to share him with anybody else. This<br/>feeling they had for each other was new to the two them, well, secretly they did<br/>both care for each other but would have never admitted it. In some ways Ranma<br/>knew he had to thank Kuno and Ryoga for his new relationship with Akane. Ranma<br/>was still slightly shocked at the fact that he actually made love to her in<br/>Washu's lab. He could remember every detail, it was totally spur of the moment,<br/>driven by some passion within that came out in that instant that they kissed.<br/>He could still feel Akane's body next to his, still hear the sound of her voice<br/>in his ear. I love her I do love her, Ranma told himself. But, also something<br/>within from the same place also told him not to hurt the other two. Shampoo and<br/>Ukyo had their hearts set on him, he knew that, and he also knew they were not<br/>lacking in the beauty category either. Yet beauty wasn't at the heart of this<br/>matter, one should never fall in love based on looks alone. That is how hearts<br/>can be broken, but Ranma knew the two girls, knew how devoted they were to him,<br/>and knew that generally Shampoo and Ukyo were both wonderful, kind people.<br/>"So what should I do?" he asked himself.<br/>"Do what is in your heart." Came a voice.<br/>If he could Ranma would have jumped right of his skin. He felt like<br/>kicking himself for letting his guard down so low that just anyone could sneak<br/>up on him. He looked around expecting it to be one of Tenchi's girls but there<br/>was nobody there. Then, out of the corner of his eye he spotted something, or<br/>was that someone. He turned towards the lake and gasped in a mixture of<br/>surprise and awe. She was 'standing' on the surface of the lake dressed in<br/>elegant and regal finery, her sky blue hair was long and lustrous, her voice was<br/>soft and gentle, she was the most beautiful creature Ranma had ever seen in his<br/>entire life.<br/>"W-w-what?" Ranma managed to stammer.<br/>"Do what is in your heart, Ranma Saotome." She said.<br/>Ranma stumbled backwards and fell down onto his rear on the rock he'd been<br/>sitting on. "H-h-how do you know my name, and w-w-who are you?" he asked her.<br/>The woman laughed, it was like the chiming of little bells. "My name is<br/>Tsunami."<br/>Tsunami. She's the one Sasami is supposedly going to turn into when she<br/>grows up!, Ranma told himself. That little girl is going to look like her! My<br/>god she's beautiful!<br/>"Yes, I am the vision of Sasami in the future." Tsunami answered him<br/>hearing his thoughts, then she blushed. "And thank you, I think you rather<br/>handsome yourself."<br/>Ranma's eyes went wide, she was able to read his thoughts. "Well, I-uh-<br/>that is-" he stammered. "Don't be worried, I came because I felt you needed<br/>someone to talk to, someone to help you sort things out." She reassured him.<br/>"I got one heck of problem on my hands, lady." Ranma laughed and scratched<br/>his head Tenchi-style. Tsunami giggled and covered her mouth in a way that made<br/>her look even cuter, if that was possible. "I can see that." She laughed.<br/>"Akane told me that I am 'allowed' to marry more than one wife because of<br/>my heritage with the royal family, but I know deep down she's not happy with the<br/>idea." Ranma explained. "Answer this question, if she wasn't happy with the<br/>idea then 'why' did she tell you?" Tsunami asked him.<br/>"I'm not sure, she could have kept it to herself, but she told me after<br/>Ukyo and Shampoo showed up," he said. "I don't really know."<br/>Tsunami glided across the water to the edge of the lake leaned towards the<br/>young Saotome. She was almost close enough to his face to kiss him, this names<br/>Ranma blush a furious red. He has grown up around beautiful woman, but this<br/>woman made them 'all' pale in comparison. "Then you should ask her why." She<br/>told him. "Maybe what she tells you will help you." She adds as she stands back<br/>up.<br/>Ranma recovers his composure and says, "You know, you're right I should<br/>ask her." Quickly he stands up and starts for the house. "Uh, thank you." He<br/>thanks her then runs off.<br/>After Ranma is far enough away Tsunami folds her arms and looks to the<br/>side with a whimsical expression. "You can show yourself now." She says. A<br/>person materializes next to her floating in the air. She is no less beautiful<br/>than Tsunami, her long white hair hangs low and lustrous over her curvaceous<br/>frame, she skin is tanned, on her face are three curious blue markings on her<br/>forehead and above her cheeks.<br/>"You handled that pretty well." Said Urd.<br/>"Well, he 'was' easier to work with than Tenchi." Tsunami smiled.<br/>"Thank you for helping with Tenchi, by the way." Tsunami thanked her.<br/>Urd sighed, "Boy was he a hard one to crack, I thought I'd never get<br/>through his mental shell." The white haired goddess smiled and laughed, "I hope<br/>the outcome was what you were looking for."<br/>"He had the feelings in his heart, but he needed the right 'push' to make<br/>him act on it." Urd went on.<br/>"Oh yes, its exactly what I hoped for." Tsunami sighed happily.<br/>Urd floated away from the lake and headed for the forest. "Well, I'd<br/>better be getting back, gotta keep my eye on Kaiichi and Belldandy you know."<br/>She said.<br/>"Say hi to Bell and Skuld for me." Tsunami called to her.<br/>"Will do, see ya." Urd called back before vanishing.<br/>Tsunami's visage shimmered with golden light as she slowly vanished with a<br/>happy, contented smile on her lips.<p>Ranma found Akane at the onsen. He wasn't sure but something told him to<br/>check there. Perhaps, he thought, it was Tsunami directing him to the right<br/>place. The youngest of the three Tendo sisters was a bit surprised at his<br/>entrance. She was dressed in little more than a pink towel as she relaxed in<br/>the warm waters surrounded by the sound of singing song birds and running water.<br/>"Ranma, what are you doing here?" she asked, a blush on her face.<br/>"I-uh-I needed to talk to you." He replied.<br/>Akane glided through the water over to where Ranma stood. The young man<br/>sat down there and let his bare feet dip into the water. Akane put her elbows<br/>on the edge of the pool and looked up at him.<br/>"Can't decide can you." She said in a matter of fact like tone.<br/>"Actually, I wanted to ask 'you' something." Ranma told her.<br/>Akane perked up her eyebrows. "If you're not happy with the idea of me<br/>marrying more than one wife, why did you tell me I can because of my royal<br/>status?" he asked.<br/>Akane sighed, "I said I'd accept anything you-"<br/>Ranma cut her off putting a finger to her lips and asked, "You told me<br/>that but I want the truth, why?"<br/>"Because I know how I would feel if-" she began. "If you weren't with<br/>me." He finished for her. Akane sighed and looked at her hands. Ranma turned<br/>her face up to his gently. "I love you, I'm not ashamed to admit it, and I'm<br/>happy with what we did in Washu's lab." He told her.<br/>"You would be, you're a 'guy'." She laughed.<br/>"Hey, I didn't hear you complain." Ranma smirked.<br/>They laughed then leaned towards one another and kissed gently. "I see it<br/>in their eyes, Ukyo and Shampoo love you with all their heart, like I do." Akane<br/>said when they parted.<br/>"It will be an adjustment, but I 'can' live with it if they will." She<br/>continued.<br/>"I wonder how Mr. Tendo will handle this." Said Ranma, dreading the<br/>possibilities. He could still feel the bite of the man's bokken from the time<br/>Ukyo came to stay with them two years ago. After that he couldn't look at<br/>okinomiaki without getting queasy for a month.<br/>"And Dad." He went on.<br/>"Happosai would be proud of you." Akane giggled.<br/>Ranma gave her a horrified expression then laughed at the joke. "He'd be<br/>giddy beyond human expression." Ranma laughed. Akane joined in laughing so hard<br/>she nearly lost her towel.<br/>"Opps!" she said grabbing it just in time.<br/>"Why be so modest, I've already seen what you got and then some." Ranma<br/>said with a seductive smile. Akane blushed furiously and gave him a playful<br/>punch in the arm. "You lech!" she laughed.<br/>"You really are cute, and I think you have a great body." He told her.<br/>Ranma took her hand, his fingers caressed hers. The young Tendo sister blushed<br/>deeply. "You're not just saying that because you want to get me in bed again do<br/>you." She said smirking. Ranma leaned down just close enough to kiss her. "I<br/>meant what I said," he told her softly. "And a guy 'can' hope can't he."<br/>Akane gasped in pretend shock then grabbed the boy and pulled him head<br/>first into the hot water. Ranma came up sputtering then found himself with<br/>Akane's arms wrapped around him. "We'd better not take too long because if Ukyo<br/>and Shampoo come looking for us it could be World War III." She whispered to<br/>him. She let her towel fall, kissing and caressing each other the two slowly<br/>eased down into the warm water.<p>An hour later, Ranma and Akane went walking through the countryside. The<br/>young Tendo sister had a bright, happy glow on her face. She hugged the young<br/>Saotome boy's arm lovingly. Ranma had been so gentle with her despite his new<br/>incredible strength. She could easily imagine herself spending the rest of her<br/>life with him. They traveled the path that leads past Fonaho-Oh and found Ukyo<br/>and Shampoo there in conversation. The two young woman looked as if they'd be<br/>best friends for years the way they talking, but in reality they were bitter<br/>rivals for Ranma's heart. Ranma looked at Akane, she nodded, time to tell them<br/>had come. But, the two wondered how would the girls handle it.<br/>The two were surprised at how well Ukyo and Shampoo were handling the<br/>Ranma's decision. They didn't know how to react, whether to be happy or angry.<br/>They were both at a loss for words for the second time in the same day.<br/>"If the two of you can set your differences aside with Akane I know we can<br/>make this work out." Ranma told them.<br/>"You want to marry all three of us." Ukyo said still unable to believe it.<br/>"Is very unusual." Shampoo said.<br/>Ranma reached out and took both girls' hands. "I know how much you love<br/>me, and I really care about the two of you although I haven't really shown it<br/>all that well in the past." He explained to them.<br/>"Besides, I'm sure the people in space never had okinomiaki before." Ranma<br/>went on with a smile hoping to lighten the mood.<br/>Shampoo gasped, "We have to live in space!"<br/>"No, no, but we'd have to get married in space to make it legal." Said<br/>Akane. "I think, we'd have to ask Princess Aeka."<br/>"Oh." Ukyo and Shampoo said together.<br/>"What do we have to loose, we get to be with one another freely without<br/>any barriers or worries, and besides you'd all be princesses." Ranma told them<br/>smiling.<br/>"Shampoo would be princess?" Shampoo asked.<br/>Ranma smiled and laughed, "You three are already has beautiful as<br/>princesses, so you might as well become princesses for real."<br/>"Ranma." The three girls swooned to his words.<br/>"Ryoga and Kuno have been taken care of, sort of, so we have nobody to<br/>worry about or get in our way." Ranma went on.<br/>Akane gasped just then with sudden realization. "Uh, Ranma, you're<br/>forgetting someone." She told him.<br/>"Huh?" he said. "Who?"<br/>Shampoo jumped to her feet and pointed towards the forest. "Mousse!" she<br/>cried. Ranma learned from his encounter with Tsunami not to let his guard down,<br/>so his new found powers and awareness told him to move...now. He dodged to the<br/>side, his body literally blurring as he moved, a chain whip lashed out where<br/>he'd be sitting only an instant before.<br/>"Ranma no baka!" Mousse yelled from the top of one of the nearby trees.<br/>Akane sighed, "Here we go again."<br/>What is this, open season on me?, Ranma though to himself. The young<br/>Chinese martial artist was an expert at the hidden weapons style. Although he<br/>was severely nearsighted Mousse was no slouch. If this situation turned into an<br/>all our fight things could get real interesting really quick. Ranma fought<br/>Mousse in the past, once while trying to save Shampoo from that shaggy no good<br/>ghost cat Mamolin, but that was a few years ago. Mousse's experience on<br/>Togenkyo Island had helped to hone his fighting prowess.<br/>"I don't know what's going on here, but I can't allow it!" the young man<br/>cried as he hurled himself into the air and landed deftly on his feet only a few<br/>inches away from Ranma.<br/>"This not concern you!" Shampoo yelled at him.<br/>"It does," Mousse shouted back. "'I' Love you, I'm the one who wants to<br/>be your husband!"<br/>"Sometimes a guy has to know when you give up, but you're not one of those<br/>guys." Said Ranma.<br/>"I'll never give up because Shampoo is mine." Said Mousse.<br/>"Shampoo belong to Ranma now." The Chinese girl said folding her arms.<br/>Mousse flicked his wrists and two sai appeared in his hands. "Then, we<br/>decide this with a duel, just you and me Ranma." He said relaxing into a<br/>fighting stance, the razor sharp points of the sai aimed the young Saotome.<br/>"Hey, I don't want to fight you, but I'm also not giving up Shampoo." Said<br/>Ranma waving his hands in front of him.<br/>"Then I'll make you fight!" Mousse cried and lunged with the sai leading<br/>the way. Ranma dodged to the side, his visage blurring with movement. Mousse<br/>recovered, reversed the sai in his hands and whirled around with them aiming at<br/>Ranma's midsection. To Ranma's perspective Mousse was in slow motion, he was<br/>able to easily step away from the Chinese man's strike.<br/>"How can you move so fast?" Mousse asked as he caught his breath. "I<br/>should have skewered you just then." Ranma knew he was telling the truth, if he<br/>didn't have the training to use his Jurai powers Mousse would have gotten him<br/>with that move.<br/>"You don't want to fight me Mousse, I've changed." Ranma warned him.<br/>The martial artist dropped the sai and quickly produced a three-section<br/>staff. "Let's test that!" he cried. Mousse whirled around sending the sections<br/>of the weapon flying towards Ranma in one blindingly fast move. Ranma blurred<br/>for an instant just enough to change positions slightly and the weapon passed<br/>him harmlessly.<br/>"What the hell!" Mousse explained in shock.<br/>Mousse reacted quickly, threw out his right hand shooting out a long chain<br/>whip. Ranma has been expecting Mousse to make a move, but the chain caught him<br/>and wrapped around his body pinning his arms. "HA!" Mousse laughed. "You're<br/>not that good."<br/>Ranma eased his mind as Katsuhito taught him and focused on calling upon<br/>his Jurai power. There was still much he had to learn about his hidden<br/>abilities, so he simply tried something new out of the blue. Mousse gasped as<br/>Ranma began to shimmer with a golden glow then vanish. The chains with nothing<br/>now to hold them up just feel to the ground harmlessly. Mousse heard and felt<br/>something displace the air behind him. Before he could come around with the<br/>handful of shurikens he now had Ranma grabbed his arm and forced him to the<br/>ground.<br/>"You were saying." Ranma said. He wasn't even breaking a sweat. The<br/>girls hadn't moved during this entire exchange, they had been watching with<br/>total fascination and wonderment.<br/>"H-h-how did you do that?" Mousse asked in wonder. He'd seen many things,<br/>many wonders, many horrors, but nothing like actual honest to goodness<br/>'teleportation'!<br/>Ranma felt a gentle hand on his arm. He looked up into Shampoo's gentle<br/>eyes. "Let me talk to Mousse for moment." She said. "Alone."<br/>Ranma nodded and let the young man go. He stepped back and joined the<br/>other two girls who were still over by the great Juraian tree. Mousse sat up on<br/>the ground and looked at Ranma with awe and a new kind of respect. He knew<br/>Ranma was a strong martial artist, he knew about his ability to throw a chi<br/>blast, but powers like he demonstrated today were remarkable. Then, he looked<br/>up at Shampoo. The beautiful Chinese girl kneeled down in front of him and<br/>looked him in the eyes.<br/>"Shampoo I-" he began.<br/>"No, you listen." She interrupted.<br/>"It Shampoo's decision who she want to be with, not Mousse's." she went<br/>on. "I thank you for what you do on Togenkyo Island to save Shampoo, it was<br/>brave, but changes nothing." She told him.<br/>Mousse looked down at the ground. "I've been in love with you for as long<br/>as I remember, you're all I can think about." He said.<br/>"Mousse must forget Shampoo, move on, there more fish in sea." She said.<br/>"What about Akane?" Mousse asked.<br/>"She marry Ranma too." Shampoo told him. "And Ukyo."<br/>Mousse looked at her as if he didn't understand what she just said, then<br/>looked at Ranma and the other girls across the clearing. "You can't be serious,<br/>he's marrying all three of you!" he shouted.<br/>"Yes, there is much you not know Mousse, much you no understand." She<br/>explained.<br/>"Then help me to understand why I must live with my heart torn asunder."<br/>Said Mousse. Shampoo sighed. She really did like the young man, he was<br/>annoying at times, but she didn't like him enough to love him. Yet, she also<br/>didn't want him to suffer because of her either. "Shampoo will tell you then."<br/>She said.<p>The house was a buzz with activity inside and out. Mousse wasn't sure<br/>what to expect. He remembered watching an American movie on TV once staring<br/>someone famous named Richard Dreyfus, if he read the English credit correctly.<br/>He often imagined what it would be like to meet real aliens. Mousse envisioned<br/>himself as Dreyfus walking up the ramp to the alien ship, looking at the<br/>wondrous interior with all of its exotic and beautiful sights and sounds. This<br/>"Close Encounter" was very different, these aliens were gorgeous babes.<br/>Mousse was fascinated with Sasami, she was the cutest thing he ever seen.<br/>She also made one of the best meals he'd ever tasted. If she worked at the<br/>ramen restaurant we'd be rolling in Yen!, he thought.<br/>Ranma and the girls sat with Tendo and Saotome. They hadn't let the cat<br/>out of the bag yet, they just sat together eating dinner quietly, but did notice<br/>the curious glances the two old men were giving them. Finally, Ranma decided to<br/>say something.<br/>"Dad, Mr. Tendo, everybody," he said to get their attention, they all<br/>looked his way. "I have an announcement to make."<br/>"Akane and I are getting married," he continued, Genma and Soun's faces<br/>lit up like two blazing suns just born. "But I'm also marrying Ukyo and<br/>Shampoo." The two older men dropped their chopsticks in unison and face<br/>faltered with a loud crash.<br/>"YOU'RE WHAT!" Soun cried after he climbs up to his feet.<br/>"HOLD ON HERE!" Genma joins him.<br/>Aeka clears her throat and stands up drawing the attention of the two<br/>irate fathers. "Lord Ranma is a member of the Royal Family of Planet Jurai, is<br/>in the Line of Succession to the throne, and as such has the right to marry as<br/>many wives as he so pleases." She said calmly. "In fact, it is his<br/>responsibility to do so, as a member of the Line of Succession he is expected to<br/>have many sons and daughters, this is only possible if he has more than one<br/>wife." She goes on.<br/>"But, how are they-" Genma started to ask.<br/>"The marriage will take place offworld of course, possibly the moon<br/>station where Seina Yamada got married." Said Aeka. Tenchi laughed, he<br/>remembered that 'interesting' day. He looked back on it as a prelude to what<br/>would happen to him, or what 'was' happening to him now. He remembered the look<br/>on the young GP Academy graduate's face during the ceremony as he was presented<br/>to his 'nine' wives. Lady Seto, of course, being the Great Manipulator that she<br/>had been instrumental in the whole affair. Tenchi often wondered when she would<br/>have one day returned to try and 'arrange' such a marriage for him. If she was<br/>planning something boy was she in for one major disappointment.<br/>"Look at this way Dad, once we're married to Ranma we'll be princesses."<br/>Akane smiled brightly.<br/>"Yes, and the marriage gifts from the royal family will be quite<br/>extensive." Said Aeka. "Uh, marriage gifts?" Soun and Genma asked at the same<br/>time.<br/>"Oh yes, Ranma will become 'quite' rich when the marriage is done." Aeka<br/>replied, smiling like a Cheshire cat. Seto would be proud of me., she thought<br/>to herself.<br/>"Well, maybe this isn't so bad after all, eh Tendo." Said Saotome.<br/>"Its what we dreamed of Saotome, and more." Tendo said, tears streaming<br/>down his cheeks.<br/>Ranma spoke up then, "There is one other thing, and Princess Aeka you<br/>could help out with this."<br/>"Oh?" she said curiously.<p>Tenchi and Ranma stood together waving farewell to their friend. To<br/>Tenchi he was new friend, but Ranma has known the young man for some time now.<br/>The girls, Tenchi's six stood beside him, and Ranma's three stood beside him.<br/>In the background stood Noboyuki, Saotome, Tendo, and Katsuhito. Mousse waved<br/>back before turning around looking up into the interior of the great ship. It<br/>was called the Kamadake II, and walking up its boarding ramp made him 'feel'<br/>like he was reliving that scene in the American movie. The ramp slowly closed<br/>behind him and the huge GP cruiser slowly lifted off and roared across the sky<br/>into the horizon. Amane and Kiriko met Mousse and processed his GP Academy<br/>application. The young man looked out the window in the great ship's<br/>observation deck as the Earth quickly receded into the distance. He smiled, he<br/>was actually happy for Shampoo finally gaining the happiness she dreamed of<br/>having. He was also smiling for himself, a part of him was heartbroken to<br/>loosing Shampoo, but another part of him was happy too. Happy for the new life<br/>he was going lead, here he could forget Shampoo and start fresh with a new life.<br/>Mousse turned away from view of his homeworld disappearing into the distance, he<br/>looked forward towards the future, his bright new future in the Galaxy Police.<p>CONTINUED IN PART 5...<p>FAMILY REUNION - PART 5: The End of Summer<p>Its time for the two families to go their separate ways. Yet, with the end of<br/>summer vacation something new and beautiful has begun.
