This work of fiction is not created for commercial purposes and is done for fan entertainment only without profit.<p>F A M I L Y R E U N I O N<p>PART 3: Uninvited Guests<p>By Michael "TheZorch" Haney<p>Ranma sat up and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. He looked around the room and was surprised to see Tenchi was already up and about. The clock on the bed side table said it was only seven in the morning. That kids get up early, he said to himself. It had been a very interesting day and night yesterday, so many revelations had some out. Ranma didn't really think about them at the moment as he yawned and climbed off his futon. He fished his toothbrush and paste out of his luggage and headed for the bathroom. Luckily Tenchi had shown him around the house before they went to bed that night so he could find where the bathroom was. The new Second Prince of Jurai shambled his way up the hall towards the upstairs bathroom, really a half-bath, and froze in his tracks when he heard a piercing scream from the bedroom girls all shared.<br/>Ranma sighed heavily, "Happosai no baka."<br/>Sure enough the diminutive old pervert came crashing through the doorway with a huge bag full of bras and panties. All of the girl, Akane and her sisters, Princess Aeka, and little Princess Sasami raced out of the door in hot pursuit. So enraged were they that they didn't even notice that they were all nearly half dressed.<br/>"Give those back you old pervert!" Akane screamed.<br/>"How dare you touch my unmentionables!" Aeka cried.<br/>"What a haul, what a haul, Hehehehe!" the old pervert shouted gleefully.<br/>Ranma groaned and joined the chase. He knew if he didn't stop the old fool these alien women might turn some ray gun on him or something, and though he was a total pain in the ass most of the time he was the Master of the Anything Goes Martial Arts Dojo after all. Downstairs Ryoko lounged on the couch watching television when the procession raced through the living room. She gave them a brief glance and did a Spock Maneuver. Suddenly, she noticed something, someone or something was feeling her up! She looked down at the strangest creature she had ever seen, it looked like an old man, but he was shorter than Sasami.<br/>"Now you are what I call a 'real' woman." The old man sighs as he squeezes both of her large firm breasts.<br/>The ex-space pirate leaps into the air with an ear piercing scream that catches everybody's attention. The girls who had been chasing the old man turned around and watched as the old man went flying as Ryoko flew into the air.<br/>"That-that-thing just felt me up!" Ryoko cried in rage.<br/>"Uh, ho, he got Ryoko." Said Sasami.<br/>"We'd better duck and cover!" cried Mihoshi.<br/>"Why?" asked Akane. As if in answer to her question a bright glowing ball formed in Ryoko's hand and transformed into a long, slender shaft of blue light in her fist. "Prepare to die!" she bellowed and threw herself at the old pervert.<br/>"!" Ryoko screamed, her face a mask of certain death. "I'LL GET YOU, NOBODY TOUCHES ME BUT MY TENCHI!"<br/>"What's going on, I can hardly do any work with all this noise!" Washu yelled from her lab door. The diminutive genius sweatdropped as she watched her daughter dart around chasing a tiny old man around the room. Ranma hit the bottom of the stairs and could do nothing but stand and watch in total fascination. Happosai was truly enjoying himself without realizing the real mortal danger he was in. Things were going to quickly get out of control, so Ranma ran into the fray and dropped kicked the old man to the floor.<br/>Tenchi chose this moment to run into the house. He'd been outside when he heard the commotion and ran as fast as he could. He froze solid when he reached living room, his gaze had fallen on Aeka who was standing there wearing nothing but a pair of pink, panties and bra. A second later a trickle of blood dripped form his nose and he fell backwards to the floor. Suddenly realizing her half-dressed appearance Aeka tries to cover herself with her arms and blushes furiously.<br/>"You little lecher, don't you cause enough trouble back home, now you gotta go and cause more here!" Ranma yelled at the semi-conscious old man he held in his hand.<br/>"But there are so many gorgeous women in this house, I couldn't control myself." Happosai whined.<br/>Ranma shook the old pervert and yelled back, "When the hell do you ever control yourself!"<br/>"Who or what is this, whatever it is?" Washu asks.<br/>"He's Happosai, the dojo sensei to my father and Mr. Saotome, unfortunately." Akane explained.<br/>"He's always running around chasing women and stealing their panties and stuff." Said Nabiki. "He's addicted to it."<br/>Ryoko points her sword at the old man growling low in her throat, "Hold him still and I'll cure him of all his ills."<br/>"Down girl," Washu laughed pushing Ryoko's sword arm away. "I have a better idea." A Cheshire cat grin spreads over the genius' face. "Bring him to my lab, Little Ryoko." She goes on and leads the way. Ranma hands his package to the cyan haired woman and watches them vanish into the broom closet door.<br/>"Better him than me." Tenchi breathed as he recovered and climbed up off the floor.<br/>"We'd better go get dressed girls." Nabiki told them when she realized she was in nothing more than a pair of panties. Tenchi had turned around when she spoke and got an eye full. The middle Tendo sister was anything but unattractive, and had endowments that would have made Ryoko jealous. The girls winced as the young man for a second time passed out on the floor.<br/>"Geeze, you'd think he never saw a girl naked before." Ranma scratched the back of his head, a blush on his face as he looked away from the half-dressed women.<p>Some distance outside the Masaki home two figures hid within the forest underbrush. A third figure wearing an all black ninjitsu costume came running towards them while keeping to the shadows. He stopped before the two that were hiding and bowed low.<br/>"What have you seen, report." Commanded Tatawaki Kuno.<br/>"It is amazing, but you will not believe what I have learned master." The short, bucktoothed ninja reported. "Speak." Kuno demanded.<br/>"This is unimaginable but I have learned that Ranma's relatives are, not of this world," the little man went on. "And that he himself is one of them."<br/>"Not of this world?" Ryoga Habiki asked, confused. "What do you mean by that?"<br/>"I overheard the old Shinto priest and the other young man who is Ranma's cousin that they are in fact, extraterrestrials." The ninja told them.<br/>"Aliens!" Kuno and Ryoga both gasped.<br/>"Can it truly be?" said Ryoga. His was more a statement than a question to the little diminutive ninja.<br/>The three heard a sound at the house. Turned to watch as the lovely blonde woman they had seen the other day ran from the house wearing some kind of blue uniform. "I'll be back in a few hours." She called towards the house. She ran out onto the pier, pulled something from her pocket, and then vanished into thin air. An instant later an object began to rise out of the lake. It was a spaceship! The ship turned slightly away from the Masaki house then raced across the sky at an incredible speed and disappeared into the blue.<br/>"It's true, they really are aliens." Ryoga said in shock.<br/>"At last, now I realize why Akane Tendo will not acknowledge her true love, for she is being controlled by the 'vile alien fiend' Ranma Saotome." Kuno growled.<br/>"We have to do something, there is no telling what they could be doing to Akane in there!" Ryoga exclaimed. Images of the three Tendo sisters strapped to metal tables being administered anal probes by a horde of short gray, big headed aliens flashed through his mind.<br/>"Patience my friend, I propose a truce, first we subdue the 'vile' beast Ranma Saotome, and then we fight for the hand of the lovely Akane Tendo in an honorable duel, agreed." Said Kuno as he offered his hand. Ryoga took saying, "Agreed, for Akane."<br/>"But, how are we going to get to Ranma with the others around?" Ryoga asked. At the house, a young girl of perhaps eight years old with sky blue hair came out of the back door carrying a large garbage bag.<br/>"How else to capture a beast, my dear Ryoga Habiki, but by use bait." Smiled Kuno.<p>With all of the commotion in the house finally settled down, for now, Tenchi and Ranma decided to relax on the couch and watch some television. Mr. Tendo and Mr. Saotome were at the dinner table with Katsuhito playing a game of chess. Aeka, Ryoko, and two of the Tendo sisters were enjoying some morning tea. Kasumi came out of the kitchen wearing oven mitts, and had a worried look on her face.<br/>"Has anyone seen Sasami?" she asked.<br/>"I thought she was with you in the kitchen." Said Ryoko.<br/>"She went to take the trash out and hasn't returned." Kasumi replied.<br/>"How long ago?" asked Aeka.<br/>"About twenty minutes or so." Kasumi told her.<br/>Tenchi got up and headed for the kitchen. "I'll find her, she might be gathering vegetables in the storage shed." He said. Tenchi passed through the kitchen and went out the back door. The shed which was attached to the house was still locked up. He decided to check around the house where the garbage container was kept. He froze in his tracks at what he saw. A bag of trash lay on the ground, next to it was one of Sasami's shoes. Sticking out of the shoe was a rolled up piece of paper. Tenchi grabbed it up and unrolled it as fast as his hands could work the paper. As he read the message he gasped in horror.<br/>"Aeka, Ranma!" Tenchi cried as he ran back to the living room.<br/>"Lord Tenchi, what is it?" Aeka asked with concern.<br/>"I found this note in one of Sasami's shoes outside, it's addressed to Ranma." He said handing the note to Ranma. The Saotome boy opened it and read it out loud, "Ranma Saotome, if you do not wish anything unfortunate to happen to the young blue haired girl you will come to the great majestic tree just south of the Shinto shrine, come alone. Signed, the Avengers of Akane Tendo."<br/>Aeka screamed in horror. "Sasami's been kidnapped!" Ryoko gasped. "Who would do such a thing?" Kasumi asked in concern.<br/>"I recognize this chicken scratch anywhere." Ranma said in a low growl. Akane took the note and looked at it. "You're right, I've seen this handwriting before, and it's pretty awful." She said. Ranma clenched his teeth as he made a fist, the joints in his fingers popped loudly. "Tatawaki Kuno." He snarled.<br/>"Kuno baby is many things but not a kidnapper." Said Nabiki.<br/>"This is his handwriting, I'm sure of it." Ranma replied.<br/>Aeka slammed her hands onto the table and leaped to her feet. "I demand you tell me who this malefactor is!" she shouted.<br/>"He's our sempai at Fureinken High School back in Nerima." Said Akane. "Why would he kidnap Sasami?" asked Tenchi. "Easy, he's got a huge crush on Akane and is probably doing this to force me to fight him for her." Ranma explained.<br/>"Please, Lord Tenchi you much get my sister back!" Aeka pleaded.<br/>"No, he said for me to come alone, I'll get Sasami back." Said Ranma.<br/>"I should come, to watch your back." Tenchi suggested.<br/>"Alright, but hold back so he doesn't see you, I'll distract him and you grab Sasami and take her home." Ranma told him. "Sounds like a plan." Tenchi agreed.<p>The great tree in question, Ranma realized, had been Fonaho-Oh the space tree that belonged to his grandfather. Ranma plowed through the underbrush and came out into the clearing that surrounded the great tree. Sure enough Sasami was there tired up to the massive trunk of the Juraian tree. Ranma looked around but didn't see anyone else.<br/>"Ranma, it's a trap!" Sasami cried as the young Saotome rushed towards her intending to free her. From the tree branches above a dark shape lunged towards him holding a bokken. Ranma dodge out of the way as Kuno landed on his feet and in a Kendo fighting stance.<br/>"Your rein of evil ends this day Ranma Saotome!" Kuno exclaimed.<br/>"Have you lost your marbles Kuno!" spat Ranma.<br/>"Silence, fiend!" Kuno cried as he ran taking several swipes at Ranma's head. "With your demise I shall free the fair Akane Tendo from your vile spells." Ranma leapt out of Kuno's reach and landed on one of Fonaho-Oh's great branches. "Free Akane, what the hell are you talking about?" Ranma asked.<br/>"Do not play dumb with me, Ranma Saotome, alien demon!" Kuno shouted back. Alien demon, oh no, how did he find out about my heritage, Ranma thought. Kuno jumped toward Ranma swinging his bokken. The young Saotome dodged out of the way, but only just barely. He felt a stinging feeling on his arm, and when he looked his shirt sleeve was cleanly cut and he was bleeding slightly.<br/>"Hey, that thing's sharp, your gonna hurt somebody!" Ranma yelled at him. "Oh but that is exactly the point." Kuno said calmly. The wooden bokken suddenly cracked in half down the middle and fell to the ground revealing a long, slender, finely crafted blade. Oh my god, he's actually out to kill me, Ranma realized in horror.<br/>"The sword of Kuno shall taste your blood this day Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo will be avenged!" Kuno bellowed as he ran with the sword held high. Ranma didn't have time to avoid the swing, he grabbed a rock off the ground and the blade sent up a shower of sparks as it struck. Out of the corner of his eye Ranma saw Tenchi pull Sasami down off the tree. With the little girl safe Ranma decided not to pull any punches now. This was getting way too serious.<br/>Ranma planted his hands on the ground, lifted himself up, and swung his legs out to trip the delusional upperclassman. Kuno went down with a yelp. Ranma leapt to his feet and started to reach down for the prone man. Something yellow came out of nowhere and wrapped around his body pinning his arms.<br/>"Ryoga!" Ranma shouted in surprise.<br/>Young Ryoga Habiki stepped out of the underbrush with a satisfied grin on his face. "Well Ranma, I suppose this is finally the end." He said.<br/>"You too!" Ranma snarled. "Have you both gone nuts!"<br/>"Kuno, finish it!" Ryoga exclaimed. Ranma saw Kuno in the corner of his eye and tried to duck but the sword came in too fast. Ranma knew he'd never be able to avoid the swing, the angle would certainly cut off his head or at the very least hurt him severely. The pain never came, however. Ranma opened his eyes, next to him Katsuhito Masaki held a bokken against Kuno's blade. The two struggled against one another their swords shaking with the force.<br/>"This does not concern you, old one." Kuno grunted.<br/>"It does when it involves the life of my grandson." Katsuhito replied menacingly. "Ranma go, I will deal with this one." He went on.<br/>Ranma flexed his muscles breaking the bandana that pinned his arms and ran. He heard running footsteps behind him and knew it had to be Ryoga following him. They both ran for what seemed like an eternity until Ranma broke out into a clearing and the entrance to a cave. It's Ryoko's cave, he realized. Ryoga was close behind, he yelled at the top of his lungs and threw a barrage of bandanas. The spinning things shot past Ranma as he dodged each one. A crackling sound behind him caught his attention, he turned around and realized the bandanas had acted like spinning blades chopping the sapling behind him into kindling.<br/>"I will avenge what you've done to Akane!" Ryoga cried.<br/>"What have I done to Akane to make you guys do this?" Ranma asked.<br/>Ryoga tossed more bandanas and shouted, "Don't play me for a fool, I know you're using some alien power to control Akane's mind so she won't show her true feelings for me!"<br/>"Ryoga no baka!" Ranma shouted back. "I only just learned of my alien heritage just yesterday, and I'm only part alien!"<br/>"Lies!" Ryoga shouted. "You will never harm the woman I love ever again!" he shouted holding up his hands forming a glowing ball of energy. Ryoga's energy blast caught Ranma in the chest throwing him backwards towards the cave. He hit the rocks shattering one of them and sending stone fragments high into the air. Ranma groaned, his entire body ached with pain. He tried to move but his body just would not respond.<br/>"Now, you die." Ryoga said calmly reaching for another bandana.<br/>"NOOOOOO!" came a shrill cry. Akane came running and threw herself on top of Ranma shielding him with her body.<br/>"Akane, this has to be done, you'll understand once I-" Ryoga tried to explain, but the look of total disgust and rage on Akane's face made him take a step back.<br/>"I could never imagine that you and Kuno could ever step this low." She said calmly, but the tremor in her voice showed she was suppressing her rage. "I considered you a friend, Ryoga, how could you do this to Ranma."<br/>Ryoga tried to reach for her, but Akane slapped away his hand. "Akane, its his evil making you talk that way, I can free you-" he tried to tell her.<br/>"Is that what you think is going on?" she asked, rage still on her face. "You know don't you, about his true heritage, don't you, that's why you and Kuno are doing this." Tears welled up in her eyes as the words formed, words that came from the bottom of her heart to sting like the sharp end of a dagger. "How can I ever love someone who would kill in cold blood, I hate you, I hate you both!" Ryoga dropped the bandana he grasped in his hand and feel to his knees. A vision came to his mind, he and Akane stood face to face with one another when suddenly a massive, black expanse suddenly appeared and separated the two of them with no way to cross. He clasped his hands to his face and wept, "Oh god, what have I done!"<br/>Akane frantically brushed away the dirt and rock out of Ranma's face. His eyes were closed. She felt for his pulse, it was weak. "Ranma, Ranma please wake up, please!" she sobbed. "Don't you die on me, damn you, don't you die on me," she continued shouting at him. "I love you!" she cried and collapsed on his chest weeping. She felt a hand touch the back of her head and she looked up to see Ranma's eyes partially opened. "Ranma!" she cried and hugged him.<br/>"A-Akane, y-you s-said you-" Ranma tried to say. "If you had died I would have never forgiven myself." She sobbed. "I'll admit it, alright, I love you, heaven help me, but I love you Ranma." She went on weeping.<br/>"Akane, I lo-." Ranma breathed as the darkness of unconsciousness took him.<p>Ranma opened his eyes, his surroundings were nothing but one big blur. He blinked a few times as things began to come into focus. His surroundings were unlike anything he'd ever seen before, it was indescribable what he saw. What he could discern from the plethora of strange alien objects were several massive aquatic tanks housing all manner of bizarre yet beautiful sea creatures. Ranma tried to sit up but a firm hand held him down. He looked to his right and met Akane's concerned gaze.<br/>"Akane." He said softly. "Was I dreaming, I heard you say-"<br/>"Look, Ranma, what I said out there, I-" she stammered, her face flushed red.<br/>Ranma reached out and touched her arm, his fingers caressing her soft skin. He never realized just how soft Akane's skin was until now. He felt something deep inside of him, where it came from he did not know, but it was powerful. He felt it once before and resisted it, but no longer.<br/>"Akane, listen to me," he said. "I've, I've been really mean to you, I called you some really unflattering names and stuff." He could see tears forming in the young woman's eyes. "What you said out there has made me really rethink a lot of things, what has been happening recently has made me think a lot actually." He went on. "Ranma." Akane said surprised.<br/>"I'm glad to be your fiancé," he told her. "I would never trade that for anything in the world."<br/>"Ranma, does this mean-" Akane started to ask, her heart was beating in her chest like a kettle drum. Without saying a word Ranma pulled her close, reached a hand behind her neck gently, and pulled her into a tender but passionate kiss.<br/>"That is so touching I could just cry." Mihoshi whispered. "They look so cute together." Kasumi whispered also. Washu and Nabiki grabbed the two and pulled them towards the door to the Masaki house. "Come on girls, let's give them some space." Said Nabiki as they disappeared.<p>In the living room Tatawaki Kuno and Ryoga Habiki sat in a corner with Azaka and Kamadake hovering on either side of them. Ryoga said nothing and only had a blank look on his face. Kuno sat rocking back and forth holding the hilt of his shattered sword in his hand. As the reining champion of the Kendo Club at Fureinken High School Kuno thought his swordsmanship skills were unbeatable, but the old priest had proven him very wrong. The sheer level of skill the man displayed in their short duel proved he had much more to learn, much more.<br/>"How's my boy?" Genma asked the girls.<br/>"I fused his broken leg and two cracked ribs back together with a bone knitter," Washu explained. "So he should be up and about by dinner time tonight."<br/>"Where is Akane?" Soun asked.<br/>Washu flashed him a broad smile, "Oh, she and Ranma are a bit busy at the moment." "What does that mean?" Genma asked, confused.<br/>"They were lip locked when we left the lab." Nabiki explained.<br/>Tendo and Saotome grabbed and hugged each other. "Saotome, could it be, could it finally be?" Soun cheered. "At last, at long last our dreams are coming true!" Genma cried. "Oh, brother." Nabiki sighed.<br/>"What do we do about these two?" Washu asked pointing at the pair in the corner. "They are both guilty of attempted assassination of a member of the Royal Family of Jurai, and the kidnapping of a member of the Royal Family as well." Aeka snarled angrily. "Let's wait until Ranma and Akane come out and see what they want to do with them." Said Washu.<p>The rest of the day went by without much of an incident. Ranma and Akane didn't come out of the lab. Washu stepped inside to see if maybe they got lost inside the huge subspace complex, then quickly turned around and returned to the house. All she remembered seeing were piles of clothes strewn about on the floor around Ranma's hospital bed and two forms moving underneath a white blanket making soft moaning noises. Now, if only Tenchi were more like his cousin, Washu thought to herself.<br/>The sun was setting over the valley, the sky turned a deep red. The lab door opened and Akane stepped out helping Ranma walk. Kasumi and Sasami were putting the food on the table, the two other Tendo sisters were watching an alien soap opera with Aeka, Ryoko, and Washu. There was no sign of Genma and Soun anywhere. Little Ryo-Ohki was laying on the loveseat on her back snoozing away.<br/>"You two finally came up for air I see." Washu smiled.<br/>The two separated quickly, Akane blushed furiously. "It was nothing, totally innocent, really." She said. "Yeah, we didn't do anything." Said Ranma.<br/>"Uh huh." Washu flashed them a knowing grin. Akane flashed Ranma a 'what do we do now' look. "Dinner is ready." Kasumi announced. "First, our 'lovebirds' here have to decide what to do about these two." Washu interrupted as she walked over to the two men being held by the Jurai guardians.<br/>"I am prepared to take them to headquarters if you choose to press charges." Mihoshi said.<br/>The two young men looked up at Akane with expressions of sadness, guilt, and a little bit of fear. She looked back at them with a stern expression that made the two look at the ground in shame. "What the two of you tried to do today was almost unforgivable." She said. "I can't believe you two would actually try to kill Ranma."<br/>"We did it because, we love you Aka-" Ryoga started to say.<br/>Akane interrupted shouting, "You love me, is this how you show your feelings by trying to kill my fiancé!"<br/>"We were under the assumption you were being controlled by some alien means, my dearest Akane Tendo." Said Kuno.<br/>"Geeze, that again." Ranma groaned.<br/>"Get this straight, I am not and never have been under any alien control of any kind!" Akane exclaimed.<br/>"And, who I choose to love, and who I choose to marry is 'my' choice, not 'yours'!" she continued, balling her fists to control her rage.<br/>"But-" Ryoga tried to interrupt.<br/>Akane stepped back and stood beside Ranma. "This is what I choose, and you two are just going to have to live with it!" she told them, turned towards Ranma stood up on her toes and kissed him full on the lips. The two young men and the rest of everyone else in the room all gasped in surprise. Ranma for an instant started to instinctively push her away, but that feeling returned to squash that notion like a lead weight. Soon the who were deepening the kiss, wrapped in each other's arms. The two parted lips after several minutes but remained in each others embrace.<br/>"Akane, I do love you with all my heart, and I can learn to live with your decision," Ryoga cried. "Please forgive me, don't turn your back on me forever, I can live without your love, but living without your friendship would be too unbearable!" He pressed his face into his hands, tear leaking from around his fingers.<br/>"I'm not the one you should be apologizing to," she told him calmly. "It will be a long time before I can trust you again, Ryoga." The young man seemed slightly relieved as he nodded his head.<br/>Kuno put his broken sword on the ground before him. "The ancient sword of my clan is broken because, my dishonor has broken it," he said softly. "I have nothing to live for, the sword of Kuno is no more."<br/>"Kuno, Ryoga, what you tried to do to me today was-was-was-I can't say it, but if Akane is willing to forgive and forget then, then I will too." Ranma spoke up. "But, like she said, it's going to be a long time before we can trust the two of you again."<br/>"You're going to let them go, but they kidnapped Sasami!" shouted Aeka.<br/>"They couldn't have hurt me even if they wanted to." Sasami told her sister, tugging on her arm. "Tsunami was right there with me the whole time watching over me."<br/>The Tendo sisters looked at the little girl then at each other after seeing Aeka's 'oh shit' expression. "Tsunami, isn't that like one of those giant waves or something." Said Ranma. "We'll explain about that part later." Tenchi told him. Washu stepped forward with her hands on her hips. "I'll tell you this though, these two don't realize how close they came to becoming a pair of smoking craters today." She said in a matter of fact like tone.<br/>"Are you sure?" Aeka asked Ranma and Akane. The two nodded.<br/>"Azaka, Kamadake, you can lower your shield." Aeka commanded.<br/>"Yes ma'am." The two guardians replied. The invisible shield between flickered slightly then was gone. Kuno and Ryoga both stood up and walked up to Ranma and Akane.<br/>"We'll go now." Said Ryoga. They turned to leave but Sasami quickly ran around in front of them holding up her hands. "Stay for dinner at least, its alright we made plenty of food." She told them cheerfully, a forgiving smile on her face. Ranma marveled at the little girl, so willing to forgive and forget without question.<br/>"Sasami, after what they did!" Aeka shouted.<br/>"Well, if they say they are sorry first." Said Sasami.<br/>"We are sorry, blue hair girl, it was my idea to kidnap you." Said Kuno with his head down. "I'm sorry too, I was the one who tied you up to that tree." Said Ryoga.<br/>"Will you promise never to do anything like this again and behave while you are here?" Sasami asked, her face stern. The two nodded. Sasami's expression turned to joy, she grabbed their hands, and let the two men to the big dinner table. "Ok, then you two sit over here." She giggled putting them next to where Saotome and Tendo sat.<br/>Dinner was a wonderful feast. The lights in the dinning room were turned off so the glow from the Christmas/Startica tree could bath the room in its many colors. Kuno and Ryoga shoveled the food in, it was the best they'd ever had and were surprised to learn that Sasami had made most of it. Aeka and Ryoko, or course, sat on either side of Tenchi. Mihoshi sat the other two Tendo sisters, Katsuhito and Noboyuki sat with Soun and Tendo, and Ranma and Akane sat close together by themselves. Part way through the meal Sasami went to the kitchen and returned carrying a big multi-layered cake. Atop the huge confection was replica of the Jurai royal palace and the massive tree that stood watch over it.<br/>"What is that?" Ranma asked looking at the top piece on the cake.<br/>"That's a replica of the palace on Jurai." Sasami smiled.<br/>"Yes, and today marks the beginning of Startica on Jurai." Aeka added.<br/>Akane looked at the Christmas tree. "That's right, you mentioned something about there, that's why you got a Christmas tree up in the summer time." She said.<br/>"It's sort of like Christmas but we celebrate it like the Summer Star Festival here in Japan." Sasami explained.<br/>"Startica is celebrated for an entire month, it is the celebration of the unification of Jurai by the first Jurai King." Aeka explained.<br/>"Kings, palaces, do you mean to say that not only are you aliens by you are also royalty?" asked Kuno. Sasami smiled nodding her head in answer.<br/>"I am the First Princess of the Jurai Royal Family, Lord Tenchi here is First Prince and successor to my brother, who is his grandfather," Aeka explained. "Sasami is Second Princess of Jurai and my sister, Lord Raman is the Second Prince of Jurai by relation to my brother Lord Tenchi, and a legitimate member in the line succession to the throne." She went on.<br/>"Ranma Saotome is royalty." Kuno said in shock.<br/>"I guess we need to start calling you 'your majesty'." Said Ryoga.<br/>Ranma scratched the back of his head Tenchi-style. "Just Ranma will do, I'm not used to this royalty stuff yet." He said.<br/>"It is traditional on the first night of Startica that we have a fireworks show." Said Katsuhito. The old man held up a large satchel of different fireworks. "Yeah!" Sasami and Mihoshi both cheered.<p>Everyone gathered outside to watch the show. Brightly colored flares and rockets shot into the sky one right after the other in near perfect succession. Ranma put his arm around his fiancé who had no objection at all. The joy on Saotome and Tendo's faces were quite evident. Sasami, Mihoshi and Kasumi 'oohed and aahed' at the exploding blossoms of fire in the sky. Aeka and Ryoko missed much of the show because the two were arguing until Tenchi defused the situation by putting his arms around each woman's waist and pulling them both close to his side. Soon it was getting late, Sasami and Ryo-Ohki were already curled up in the grass fast asleep.<br/>Tenchi picked the little princess up in his arms making sure not to disturb her or the little sleeping cabbit and took her to her bedroom. Ranma and Akane followed close behind intending to so to their rooms, but the sound of someone clearing their throat made the two turn around.<br/>"Akane, Ranma, Tendo and I have talked and decided that since the two of you appear to be interested in being a real couple now that you two should share the same room." Genma told them. "But, separate beds, mind you." Soun said quickly. It's a bit late for that, thought Ranma. Akane looked up at Ranma and blushed a bright red. "Well, ok, if you think so." She said. "Good, Tenchi already put a futon in the bedroom and me and Saotome will share a room for now on." Soun smiled happily. "Now, no hanky panky you two." Soun laughed. If you only knew dad, thought Akane who failed to suppress an even darker blush.<br/>"Your two friends will bunk with me tonight," Tenchi said after returning from the bedroom where he laid Sasami down. "Dad will drive them to the train station tomorrow morning so they can go back to Nerima."<br/>"Cool." Ranma replied.<br/>A loud yawn from downstairs drew everybody's attention. Washu waked towards her door to the lab stretching her arms wide. The sound of her joints popping could be heard all the way up the stairs. "I'm off to bed, got lots of work tomorrow." She said. Ranma hurried down the stairs and stopped her. "Uh, Little Washu, you never showed up what you did with that little pervert." He said.<br/>"Oh, that, come with me." She said.<br/>Everyone followed her into the lab. Kuno and Ryoga both gasped in surprise at the sight of the incredible place. The diminutive genius led them through the complex until they reached what looked like a sealed room. Washu called up her translucent computer, typed in a command, and a holographic image appeared.<br/>"I put him in my holodeck and programmed it with something special, just for him." She smiled wickedly.<br/>Happosai appeared in the image, he was hunkered down under a table with a horrified expression on his face. The watchers could also hear everything that was happening as well. "I gotta find a way out of this place." Happy said, his voice quivering.<br/>"Oh Happy darling!" came a voice from the next room. "Is he playing hide and seek again?" asked another voice. "That naughty little thing." Said a third voice. Three people walked into the room dressed in alluring, sexy evening gowns with matching pumps. One look at the faces of the three 'women' nearly made the onlookers toss up their dinner. The three 'women' were in fact Transvestites! "There he is!" the one in a yellow dress cheered.<br/>"Help me, let me out of his living hell!" Happosai screamed as the three 'women' lifted the little man up in their arms and started coving his face with kisses. They started carrying him out of the room saying, "Stop teasing us, Happy darling, make love to us." The diminutive pervert gabbed the edge of the doorway, the girls pulled harder and his hands left scratch marks on the wall. "Have mercy on me, let me out, please!" he screamed in desperation. "I'll be good, I'll be good!"<br/>"You have such a sexy butt Happy, we're going to have lots of fun tonight." One of the 'girls' whispered into his ear. Happosai's eyes grew to the size of frying pans. "NOOOO, NOT THAT, ANYTHING BUT THAT, HAVE MERCY ON ME!" he cried louder than ever before. Suddenly he lost his grip and the three 'women' rushed him into the bedroom.<br/>"Should I?" Washu asked, her fingers hovering over her computer.<br/>"Well, he is a pain, but I don't want him ass raped." Akane said.<br/>Ryoko folded her arms smugly and snorted, "Let them 'ram rod' the little freak, it'll teach him to appreciate women more."<br/>"Ryoko!" Tenchi exclaimed, shocked.<br/>The four were off camera but could still be heard. "Oh, look at that girls, he's going to be nice and tight." One of the 'women' cheered. "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T DO IT, STOP!" Happosai cried out his voice dripping with absolute terror.<br/>"Ah, ease off on the little freak." Said Ranma.<br/>Washu tapped a few keys and the scene suddenly changed. Happosai looked around in total confusion at his surroundings, he was in a garden setting sitting on a huge lounge chair that was shaped like a throne. It took for a few moments to realize he was wearing a Grecian toga. More than a dozen young girls wearing almost next to nothing came out from all directions carrying silver platters, some had fruit, but most of the others had piles of women's bras and panties. They all kneeled down around the diminutive old man angling their bodies so he saw the maximum amount of cleavage.<br/>"How may we 'service' you, oh great God of Manly Lust?" one of the girls asked seductively, then ripped off the front of her garment exposing her endowments. A loud thud attracted the on lookers who looked down to see a bloody nosed Tenchi laying splayed across the floor.<br/>Washu dispelled the image just as the rest of the girls disrobed and rushed the little man who had the happiest expression of his entire life on his face. "That should keep him busy for the time being." She said.<br/>"I'll let him out in the morning, and tell him if he causes any more trouble I'll toss him in with six tranies instead of three." Washu continued with a wicked smirk. Then she added, "With a pain sensation amplifier turned up to maximum to boot."<br/>Tenchi was back on his feet now, Ranma leaned close and whispered to him, "Remind me never to get her pissed off." All Tenchi could do was shiver and hope he never got on the diminutive genius' bad side.<p>CONTINUED IN PART 4...<p>FAMILY REUNION - PART 4: Decisions, Decisions, Decisions!<p>With Kuno and Ryoga's murder plot against Ranma stopped life gets back to normal. Well, not quite, since Ukyo and Shampoo suddenly arrive demanding Ranma make his choice of who he wants to be with...once and for all. But what is this, someone else wants a piece of Ranma!
