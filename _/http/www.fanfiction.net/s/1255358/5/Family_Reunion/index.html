Ranma cried.<br/>She raised her arms to shield herself from the water Akane and Sasami were<br/>throwing into her face. The two girls were laughing and giggling. They stopped<br/>suddenly when Ranma began to shimmer with a golden light. A ten foot column of<br/>water rose out of the lake and loomed ominously over the two girls.<br/>"You wouldn't!" Akane dared.<br/>"You couldn't!" she continued.<br/>Ranma smiled.<br/>"He would." said Sasami calmly.<br/>SPLASH! The girl came up after being driven down to the bottom of the<br/>lake just in time to hear Ranma's maniacal laughter, "Mwwwwaahahahahaha!"<br/>"No fair, we don't have powers!" Akane whined.<br/>Washu was at her side in an instant and handed her something that looked<br/>like a gun with a six inch wide barrel and a thick hose on the other end. "Try<br/>this on him." She said. Washu put the hose into the water. Akane switched the<br/>gun on, it made a sound like a jet engine revving up. Ranma's eyes went wide as<br/>a huge blast of water shot from the weapon and hit her in the chest. When she<br/>came up the girls were laughing.<br/>"I deserved that didn't I." Ranma said.<br/>Sasami and Akane both nodded their heads. Ukyo was swimming nearby, she<br/>looked at Ranma and started giggling. "What!" Ranma said. Akane and Sasami<br/>started to giggle too, Shampoo from the shore where she was sun bathing was<br/>laughing, and Tenchi has a curious look on his face and a slight blush.<br/>"Feeling a 'draft' are we, Ranma honey?" Ukyo asked.<br/>Ranma looked down and blushed furiously. Now, when Ranma knows he's going<br/>to be swimming in cold water he tries to make sure he wears something<br/>appropriate for men and women both. This time around the girls talked him into<br/>wearing something more 'lady like'. 'She' was properly proportioned to wear one<br/>of Nabiki's two piece bikinis. Akane and Ukyo joked with him that 'she' looked<br/>really good in it. Ranma laughed it off, but the girls had to admit that as a<br/>girl Ranma did out do them in the looks department. Cup size was one of Ranma's<br/>redeeming attributes and right now 'her' attributes were exposed for all the<br/>world to admire. She quickly covered herself, grabbed up her bikini top that<br/>was floating next to her and dove into the water. Totally unable to hold it<br/>back anymore everyone including Tenchi broke out into hysterical laughter.<br/>Ranma surfaced freshly covered and folded her arms. "Its bad when you're<br/>jealous of your man because he has a better body than you do." Ukyo laughed.<br/>Akane laughed so hard she nearly feel back into the water.<br/>"That's a low blow Ukyo." Ranma sighed.<br/>Ryoko flew over and high-fived Ukyo. "And a damn good one too." The cyan<br/>haired beauty laughed.<br/>"Miss Shampoo, why don't you go for a swim?" asked Aeka. The Princess of<br/>Jurai was sunning herself on a beach blanket next to the Chinese girl.<br/>"She can't, she's got one of those Josenkyo curses." Said Washu. The<br/>diminutive genius was in a one piece green and beige swimsuit. Ukyo wore one of<br/>Nabiki's one piece swimsuits, Sasami was dressed in a frilly one piece that<br/>looked like a sailor outfit, Aeka's was in a one piece deal with a low back, and<br/>Ryoko wore a swimsuit that almost wasn't there.<br/>"What do you turn into?" Aeka asked.<br/>"Shampoo have nickname." The Chinese girl told her.<br/>"What's that?" asked Ryoko.<br/>Shampoo looked at her and Aeka and sighed, "Cat."<br/>"Oh!" Aeka said quickly.<br/>Ranma came out of the water and dried herself off, then she laid down on<br/>her beach towel next to Shampoo. "The sun feels good today." Ranma sighed<br/>feeling the warm go through her. Shampoo picked up her bottle of suntan lotion.<br/>"You want lotion?" she offered. "Sure." Said Ranma.<br/>Just as Shampoo started rubbing the lotion into Ranma's back Ryo-Ohki<br/>slowly slinked up to Ranma and gave out a loud, "MMMMIIYYYYAAAAA!"<br/>"YYYYYAAAAAAHHHHH!" Ranma screamed. Tenchi cringed some as Ranma<br/>flew into the air and climbed up onto his shoulders at a blinding speed.<br/>"Ryo-Ohki!" Sasami scolded her. "Stop that!"<br/>"Miya!" the little Cabbit smiled happily before bounding off.<br/>The girls all giggled and laughed. Tenchi blushed a bit, his cousin's<br/>breasts were pressed into the back of his head. Ranma teleported back to her<br/>beach blanket and sighed. "If your going to be married to a girl who can turn<br/>into a cat you'd better learn to start liking them." Said Ryoko.<br/>"Its not that I don't like them, its that I can't stand to be around<br/>them." Ranma explained. "It's complicated."<p>Nightfall came and it was starting to get late. Ranma, a boy again,<br/>pulled off his shirt and slipped into his green nightshirt. Akane, Ukyo and<br/>Shampoo came in dressed in nightgowns. Ukyo and Shampoo had to borrow theirs<br/>from Akane since they didn't bring any extra outfits with them. Also, since<br/>Akane and Ranma were sharing a room it was decided that the other girls also do<br/>the same. Extra pallets were brought in for the girls earlier that day.<br/>"Our fourth night sleeping in the same room with Ranma." Said Ukyo.<br/>"Nihao, any more come." Said Shampoo.<br/>Ranma yawned loudly. "Well, at least you three don't snore like pop<br/>does." He said. Ukyo and Shampoo just laughed.<br/>"Genma Saotome, Mr. Buzz Saw." Laughed Akane.<br/>Ranma and Akane looked at each other. As if they were both thinking on<br/>the same wavelength, which they were but mind reading wasn't one of Ranma's new<br/>abilities, they nodded and Akane turned to the other girls. "There is something<br/>the two of you need to know." She said. It was something the two of them<br/>decided to tell the girls. After four nights of sleeping in the same room it<br/>was only right that they knew.<br/>"Uh, well, to put it bluntly Ranma and I have been 'intimate'." Akane<br/>explained. "Yeah?" Said Ukyo.<br/>"What you talk about?" asked Shampoo.<br/>"You know, 'intimate'." Akane told them putting more emphasis on the word.<br/>Ukyo and Shampoo's eyes went wide as they both understood what she said.<br/>Ranma sighed, the looks the girls were giving him reminded him of how lions<br/>looked before they pounced on their prey.<br/>"Two times." Akane went on adding fuel to the fire.<br/>Ukyo gave her a broad smile. "Was he good?" she and Shampoo asked at the<br/>same time. Akane answered with a Cheshire cat grin which the other two girls<br/>mirrored and directed at him. Ranma rolled his eyes, fell back onto his pallet<br/>and threw his pillow over his face. What 'have' I gotten myself into?, he asked<br/>himself.<p>Two wonderful months passed. Ranma and family had seen many marvelous and<br/>wondrous things since coming to the Masaki home but what they were seeing now<br/>was the most impressive of them all. The Masaki, Tendo, and Saotome families<br/>were gathered together, they watched in fascination as the sun slowly appeared,<br/>from behind the beautiful rings of Saturn! They stood onboard the command deck<br/>of the Ryo-Ohki. There was only one week of summer vacation left so everybody<br/>was making the most the time they had together..<br/>"Its so beautiful." Ukyo said, she hung onto Ranma's arm, tears were<br/>welling up in her eyes. "Looks better in person rather than through the camera<br/>of some primitive space probe doesn't it." Said Washu.<br/>"It certainly is, big." Akane commented.<br/>"Look like big marble." Said Shampoo.<br/>"Saturn is larger than the Earth, yet the material it's made up of is so<br/>light that if you could shrink the planet it would float in Earth's oceans<br/>easily." Washu explained. Everyone went "Wow!" at the same time.<br/>"This is nothing, you should see Gamma-Draconus." Said Ryoko.<br/>"What's there?" Tenchi asked.<br/>"A red giant star orbiting by a black hole." Washu answered. "Material<br/>from the star is being pulled into the black hole creating a rather dramatic<br/>light show."<br/>"The universe is certainly a very beautiful place." Kasumi sighed looking<br/>out at the majesty of the giant ringed planet. Sasami stood next to her looking<br/>out of the observation dome that covered Ryo-Oki's bridge.<br/>Ryoko grunted. "It 'can be' and 'is' a very deadly place too." She said.<br/>"Wandering the cosmos is not always a very safe thing to do." She teleported<br/>over to Ryo-Ohki's controls. The view of the giant ringed planet began to<br/>recede into the distance, the stars began to streak by at a rapid pace.<br/>"Where are we going?" Tenchi asked as he leaned over Ryoko's shoulder.<br/>She smiled, leaned up and kissed his cheek and said, "There is one more sight to<br/>see before we go home." The trip took almost twenty minutes before the passage<br/>of the stars began to slow, everyone raced to one side of the bridge to look at<br/>one of the most incredible sights they had ever seen before.<br/>"My god what is that?" Ukyo gasped.<br/>Before then was a massive celestial body. It spun around like a galaxy,<br/>a vast glowing disk of light. The center of the disk was a void of total<br/>darkness. The Ryo-Ohki swept low over the swirling disk and soon it became<br/>clear that it was made up of dust and other material. "Infrared and radio<br/>spectrum Ryo-Ohki." Ryoko ordered. Everyone gasped in wonder as the massive<br/>object suddenly lit up with vibrant colors. And, like a great torrent a massive<br/>spray of bright light emitted out from the middle of dark region extending<br/>light-years into space.<br/>"It's a black hole." Tenchi said realizing what he was seeing. He'd seen<br/>pictures of them before in books and in videos played at school. "Is it safe<br/>for us to be this close?" Akane asked.<br/>"It's not just any black hole." Said Washu. "This one is the super<br/>massive class at the center of our galaxy. I guess you could say this old girl<br/>is the mother of our galaxy for it is because of her the Milky Way formed in the<br/>first place."<br/>"Huh?" everyone gasped.<br/>"You kidding!" shouted Shampoo.<br/>"I never kid where science is concerned." Washu replied. "Most galaxies<br/>form because they have these massive bodies at their centers. The immense<br/>gravitational pull of the black hole is what brought all of the material of our<br/>galaxy together in the time of primordial."<br/>"Amazing." Ranma breathed. He knew things like this existed, but actually<br/>seeing it for himself gave him a new respect for the forces of Mother Nature.<br/>"Are we safe here?" Nabiki asked.<br/>"Oh yeah, we'd have to practically be inside of the event horizon before<br/>we're in danger of being pulled in." Washu reassured her.<br/>"The last time I saw a black hole was on Dr. Clay's ship." Said Mihoshi.<br/>Ryoko cringed from being reminded of that embarrassing day. She still had the<br/>side-effects of being merged with Zero. Her sweet gushy personality sometimes<br/>found some way of manifesting itself in her. She didn't mind if it happened in<br/>the presence of Tenchi when they were alone, but it was embarrassing around<br/>others sometimes.<br/>Ryo-Ohki gave a series of meows that nearly made Ranma collapse. "Ok, ok,<br/>I know about that." Washu told her. "What is it, Miss Washu?" Saotome asked.<br/>"We're safe from the gravity, but not the radiation and Ryo-Ohki's<br/>radiation shielding is reaching maximum tolerance levels." Explained Washu.<br/>"Let's go home Ryo-Ohki." Ryoko told her. "Miya!" the Cabbit ship meowed<br/>in reply and the ship pulled quickly away from the massive and powerful<br/>celestial body. It took nearly thirty minutes before the blue globe of the<br/>Earth became visible to everyone on the Ryo-Ohki. Ryoko slowed the ship down as<br/>they passed the moon to give everyone a chance to look around and enjoy the<br/>sights.<br/>"I guess this is how things looked to the guys from the Apollo program."<br/>Said Ranma. As they neared Earth Ranma noticed something in the sky. He<br/>squinted then realized he recognized it. "Hey!" he yelled. "There's the<br/>International Space Station!" Everyone turned to look where he was pointing.<br/>Sure enough, in the distance was the huge Earth-built space platform.<br/>"Can't they see us?" Kasumi asked.<br/>Washu shook her head. "Nope, we're in stealth mode." She said. "It<br/>became necessary to add that feature into Ryo-Ohki's main OS after they started<br/>building that thing." Mihoshi walked up and said, "Also, after the station went<br/>up Earth classification was changed to 'none interference class 2'.<br/>"What does that mean?" Soun asked.<br/>"It means no ships without cloaking devices are allowed anywhere near this<br/>planet." Said Mihoshi.<br/>Shampoo suddenly gasped and pointed out into space and cried, "Why Shampoo<br/>can see that ship?" Washu whirled around and look for what Shampoo had seen.<br/>She spotted the ship quickly, it was large, larger than the Ryo-Ohki and the<br/>Earthling space station. "What the hell!" she exclaimed.<br/>"They are in blatant violation of Galactic Union law 334579, no uncloaked<br/>ships are allowed in this area!" shouted Mihoshi. Washu rolled her eyes then<br/>turned to Ryoko. "Try to hail them." She said. Ryoko nodded.<br/>"They're not responding, mom." Said Ryoko.<br/>"Miya, miya miya miya!" Ryo-Ohki cried out quickly.<br/>"We've just been scanned and they're locking weapons on us!" Ryoko<br/>exclaimed.<br/>"They're what?" Ranma, Akane, Shampoo, and Ukyo yelled at the same time.<br/>The floor beneath everyone's feet rumbled and shifts slightly. "Hold on<br/>everybody!" Ryoko shouted. "Evasive action Ryo-Ohki, full speed!" The Ryo-Ohki<br/>pulled away from the massive alien ship following the curvature of the Earth.<br/>Soon even the space station could no longer be seen. The alien ship appeared<br/>quickly as it increased speed to follow them. A bright blue, high-resolution<br/>beam streaked out from the alien ship and exploded against Ryo-Ohki's hull. The<br/>girls all screamed in fright and grabbed onto Ranma. Soun and Mihoshi started<br/>running around the bridge spraying the place down with tears.<br/>"Dammit!" Ryoko cursed.<br/>"Ryo-Ohki, return fire!" Ryoko ordered. "MMMIIYYYAAAA!" cried the Cabbit<br/>ship as it unleashed a blast of crimson light. A bright explosion blossomed on<br/>the outer hull of the alien ship. Suddenly, everyone was jerked off their feet<br/>as the floor fell away beneath them.<br/>"Oh no, a tractor beam!" Washu cried.<br/>A glowing ball of green light materialized in the center of the spacious<br/>bridge. Ryoko's hair suddenly stood up on end when she saw it. She'd seen that<br/>sort of effect before many times, and hoped she would never have to see it again<br/>for the rest of her life. Washu also cringed when she saw it. The ball erupted<br/>on one said and folded in on itself revealing a person inside. He was tall,<br/>wearing write robes, and had white hear and piercing yellow eyes. Aeka, Sasami,<br/>and Mihoshi all gave out a stifled cry.<br/>"NO, IT CAN'T BE!" Ryoko cried not wanting to believe who she was seeing.<br/>"Nice to see you all again, its been too long." Said Kagato.<br/>A sound like a pop and a sizzle filled the chamber and Tenchi stepped out<br/>from the group with the Master Key ignited in his hand. "I defeated you once<br/>Kagato, I can do it again." He warned.<br/>"Oh I am so frightened." Kagato replied sarcastically. "I hope you can<br/>handle that sword better than last time, I'd hate to waste my time humiliating<br/>you again."<br/>Tenchi saw movement in the corner of his eye. He chanced looking to his<br/>side for just a moment and saw Ranma standing there in a fighting stance. "So<br/>you're the one they call Kagato." He said. "Though you were dead."<br/>Kagato swept his arm and cape up as he bowed with dramatic flair. "The<br/>reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated, and you are new aren't you I<br/>don't remember seeing you before."<br/>"My name is Ranma, I'm Tenchi's cousin, and the two of us are gonna bring<br/>you down." Ranma growled. "Again."<br/>"Are you, boastful words for a mere human." Kagato smirked.<br/>"I am here because with her final breath my master restored my life."<br/>Kagato went on. "Now I will take revenge not only for my death, but for the<br/>death of my queen. Lady Tokimi."<br/>"I knew it, it all makes sense now!" Washu shouted. "She was the one who<br/>'corrupted' you from the very beginning!"<br/>Kagato bowed low towards his former professor. "Why yes, Professor." He<br/>said. "I am rather surprised it took you this long to figure it out." Kagato<br/>opened his palm and called forth a ball of green energy which he gripped in his<br/>fingers to form a sword.<br/>"Now, I bid you all a fond farewell." He laughed. "I hope you all have no<br/>regrets in the afterlife."<br/>Ranma charged up, glowing brightly as he did so and cried out, "Like hell<br/>you will!" The young Saotome released his energy in a powerful blast that took<br/>Kagato completely off guard. He didn't sense any power within the young human,<br/>the same way he couldn't sense any power within Tenchi. The young First Prince<br/>of Jurai had already abandoned the Master Key and called upon the Light Hawk<br/>Wings. He was already merging with them to form the holy armor and sword he<br/>used to destroy Kagato once before, and to defeat Lady Tokimi.<br/>"What is this?" Kagato cried out. He was only partly success in<br/>shielding himself from Ranma attack. "But how can this be?" he want on in<br/>bewilderment.<br/>A series of massive explosions caught everyone's attention. They looked<br/>out to see Kagato's ship imploding on itself. A massive spaceship surrounded by<br/>ten brightly glowing, gossamer Light Hawk Wings flew past battering the alien<br/>ship with withering fire power. Sasami smiled brightly, she knew everything was<br/>going to be ok.<br/>"I will not be defeated again!" Kagato cried. He threw himself towards<br/>the group, but suddenly had Ranma in his path. The young Saotome let out a<br/>karate battle cry and began slamming Kagato hard with blindingly fast Chestnut<br/>Fist punches. Ranma's fists were supplemented with the Power of Jurai, and to<br/>Kagato each impact was like hitting a brick wall at a hundred miles per hour.<br/>The evil space pirate stumbled backwards trying to get his bearings again, but<br/>as he looked up all he saw before the darkness too him was Tenchi's Light Hawk<br/>Sword making a downward arc straight down between his eyes.<p>Ranma had been hoping for an exciting summer vacation, but this was<br/>ridiculous. First, he learned his mother's family were all aliens and/or half-<br/>aliens. He also was not only part alien but a member of a powerful family of<br/>extraterrestrial royalty. Then, Ryoga and Kuno tried to kill him because they<br/>thought he was some sort of 'Space Monster' controlling Akane's mind. Next the<br/>two girls who are totally nuts about him to the point of being obsessive showed<br/>up and he ends up deciding to marry them and Akane. And now, now he's kicking<br/>the butt of an intergalactic scumbag that was supposed to be dead but was<br/>brought back to life by an evil goddess Tenchi supposedly killed a year ago.<br/>That alone would have been enough to drive a man to drink, or insane; which ever<br/>came first! As it was, Ranma was enjoying a glass of iced honey-lemon tea and<br/>allowing the warm waters of the onsen to ease away the tension. Tenchi sat next<br/>to him trying to do that same. This too was an eventful summer for the young<br/>first prince.<br/>"I'm sorry about all of that earlier." Tenchi apologized.<br/>"Hey, don't worry about it." Ranma waved to him.<br/>"We all thought Kagato was really dead." Tenchi said.<br/>"We really kicked his tail though didn't we, cousin." Ranma smiled.<br/>Tenchi smiled. "He wasn't expecting to be double teamed like that at any<br/>rate." He laughed. Ranma joined him and they both laughed. "Say, is Nerima<br/>this 'exciting'?" Tenchi asked Ranma.<br/>"Oh, there is always something going on in Nerima?" Ranma told him.<br/>Tenchi took Ranma's glass, filled it and his own. "Well, I've been<br/>thinking and decided I'll go to college in Nerima." Tenchi said handing the<br/>glass to his cousin. Ranma looked at him as he did a Spock Maneuver. "Yeah?"<br/>said Ranma surprised. "You know you can stay with us like Mr. Tendo offered."<br/>"Yeah, and the girls can visit after Washu connects her lab to the house<br/>in Nerima." Said Tenchi. "She said it would only take a few minutes to set it<br/>up." "Oh, so they'd have to travel through the lab to get to my house?" asked<br/>Ranma. Tenchi shook his head and replied, "Washu said it was the easiest way,<br/>and more Mihoshi proof."<br/>"Huh?" Ranma said questioningly.<br/>"Lets just say Mihoshi and Washu's technology don't get along too well<br/>together." Tenchi smiled. "Oh, I see." Said Ranma. Like Akane and cooking.,<br/>thought Ranma.<br/>"So, you're going to marry all five girls I hear." Ranma went on.<br/>Tenchi sighed. "I should have known this would be my fate when we were<br/>invited to Seina Yamada's wedding on the moon." He said. "Who is he, I keep<br/>hearing his name?" Ranma asks. Tenchi look a sip of his tea and clear his<br/>throat. "He 'was' a fellow student in high school, I was his sempai." Tenchi<br/>explained. "Then one day he just vanished and I didn't see him for several<br/>months until he showed up with a bunch of female Galaxy Police officers."<br/>"He joined the GP Academy, not on purpose anyway, but he was enjoying<br/>himself and thought it was the best thing that ever happened to him." Tenchi<br/>continued. "He and the girls left for a long time and then we were all invited<br/>to the moon for his wedding. He was marrying four wives originally, another one<br/>of Lady Seto's classic 'arranged' marriages, but she had an added twist to it<br/>and he ended up getting hitched to nine instead."<br/>"NINE!" Ranma exclaimed in shock.<br/>"Nine." Said Tenchi calmly.<br/>"He's going to be one 'busy' man." Ranma sighed.<br/>Tenchi started laughing and Ranma looked at him funny. "It wasn't 'that'<br/>funny." Said Ranma. "If only you were there when it happened you'd understand<br/>everything." Tenchi laughed.<br/>"What happened?" Ranma asked, his curiosity now fully peaked.<p>Ryoko, Aeka, and Washu sat up on the roof of the Masaki home. It was not<br/>because they wanted to get away from the general chaos of the house, but because<br/>they just wanted to enjoy the breeze. Now with summer soon coming to a close<br/>the hot days were getting cooler. It was still another month before Autumn<br/>officially started. Soon the trees in the small valley and around the lake<br/>would start to change color blanketing the land in vibrant hues of yellow,<br/>orange, red, and brown.<br/>"It sure has been an interesting summer." Said Aeka.<br/>"Yes it certainly has." Said Washu.<br/>"Pretty exciting." Said Ryoko.<br/>The sun was setting now on a day that was almost less than perfect. An<br/>outing in Ryo-Ohki with the family had been a good idea. Running into one of<br/>their worst mortal enemies who was supposed to be dead wasn't a part of the<br/>schedule though. They were all thankful that nobody was seriously injured,<br/>except for perhaps Kagato whom the three hoped was dead for good now. In the<br/>horror and excitement Ranma had proven himself in that brief moment. He and<br/>Tenchi both dispatched the vile man in only a few seconds. Aeka had been<br/>secretly afraid that if Ranma had possessed no significant powers to protect<br/>himself someone from one of the other royal houses would take advantage of that<br/>to kidnap him in order to extort Tenchi. Now that she saw first hand what the<br/>young Second Prince of Jurai was capable of she wasn't afraid. Any who dared to<br/>threaten him would have a very rude awaken.<br/>"I wonder what Tenchi's going to do." Aeka said.<br/>Ryoko looked at her. "Do what?" she asked.<br/>"After he graduates, I mean." Aeka replied.<br/>"He's going to Nerima." Said Washu in a matter of fact tone.<br/>The other two girls looked at her in surprise. "He came and talked to me<br/>before he and Ranma went up to the onsen." She went on. "I told him it sounded<br/>like a good idea and that I was going to connect the Tendo house up to my lab so<br/>we could go visit him whenever we wanted to."<br/>"This is the first I've heard of this." Said Aeka.<br/>"Yeah!" Ryoko seconded her.<br/>"He made the decision I guess after the fight with Kagato." Washu<br/>explained. "He said something about wanting to stay near Ranma to continue his<br/>training and stuff like that."<br/>"That makes sense." Aeka surmised.<br/>"So we can see him like whenever?" asked Ryoko.<br/>"Anytime we want." Washu answered her.<br/>"Cool." Ryoko replied.<br/>A delicious aroma wafted its way up to the roof. That Kasumi can really<br/>cook up a storm, and that Ukyo isn't bad either., thought Ryoko. She was happy<br/>for Ranma for having Ukyo around. Akane had been in the kitchen one day and<br/>made something simple, and of course thinking it was something Sasami made Ryoko<br/>decided to try it. That was a very bad idea. After about ten antacids and four<br/>laxatives Ryoko's digestive system returned to normal. Akane was banned from<br/>the kitchen except when she was going to get herself some water or a bottle of<br/>cola from the refrigerator.<br/>"Just one more week and they all go home." Said Ryoko.<br/>"Summer vacation is almost over that fast." Aeka sighed.<br/>"Time flies when your having fun." Said Washu.<br/>Ryoko scooted down and laid back on the roof tiles. "I'm gonna miss<br/>them." She said. Washu did the same and put her arms behind her head. "Oh come<br/>on, it's not like we're never going to see them again." Said Washu.<br/>"We will have Tenchi to ourselves until next June when he graduates."<br/>Washu continued.<br/>"When are his college classes going to start, or do you know?" Aeka asked<br/>as she laid down also. "Probably in September most likely." Washu guessed.<br/>"Its not like he's going away forever and we won't be able to see him."<br/>Washu went on.<br/>"I know, its just, well, we've never been apart from Tenchi in what, four<br/>years." Says Ryoko. "There has never been a time where we have been away from<br/>Tenchi for longer than a week, and that was during the war." Said Aeka.<br/>"There is one thing though, we won't have to worry about anymore." Washu<br/>told them. "He's ours and we're his, and nobody is going to come between us."<br/>"That is one thing we won't have to worry about." Aeka laughed.<br/>"There is one thing to worry about though." Said Ryoko. Aeka and Washu<br/>both looked at her. "Ranma, what is going to happen with Ranma when the royals<br/>on Jurai find out about him?" Ryoko asked. "You remember their reaction to<br/>Tenchi just before the war started don't you?" She went on.<br/>Aeka sighed. "That was my father's doing." She said. "Grandmother Seto<br/>thankfully put a stop to it." If there was anyone in the entire universe who<br/>had any real power over the King of Jurai it was Lady Seto. Even the king was<br/>not immune to her political prowess and influence in the Holy Council. On top<br/>that the grandmother of his daughters scared the living daylights out of him.<br/>"I could speak to Lady Seto about Ranma to see if she could make certain<br/>'opportunistic' people in the royal family do not get any ideas." She continued.<br/>"Sometimes I really wonder who really is in charge of Jurai, your father<br/>or your grandmother." Ryoko laughed. Aeka laugh also. "Push comes to shove<br/>Seto has more political clout than anybody in the royal family including Azusa."<br/>Said Washu. "Poor Seina is a prime example, that woman scares the hell out of<br/>even me." Washu went on and laughed.<p>Ranma's first reaction to Tenchi's 'vivid' description of what happened on<br/>Seina's wedding day was a severe nose bleed followed by uncontrolled laughter.<br/>Soon the two climbed out of the bath, dried themselves off and got dressed.<br/>Ranma was still giggling when they reached the house.<br/>"Damn, I guess he got a head start making a family before the honeymoon<br/>even began." Ranma laughed.<br/>"I'll just say this, after that happened I started watching my back more<br/>often because Ryoko is very 'impressionable'." Laughed Tenchi. "You know,<br/>Akane, Ukyo and Shampoo are all three very beautiful, but the girls you have are<br/>just total knock outs." Said Ranma. The memory of the day at the hot springs<br/>and seeing Ryoko and Aeka 'exposed' for the first time appeared clearly in<br/>Tenchi's mind. "Believe me, I am quite aware of just how beautiful the girls<br/>are." He said.<br/>Mihoshi and Nabiki met them at the door. The two were setting the dinner<br/>table out on the patio. "Uh, I remember what happened the last time we had a<br/>dinner out here." Said Tenchi. Mihoshi blushed furiously. "Today's my day off,<br/>so no worries." She said. Tenchi patted her shoulder, smiled, and kissed her on<br/>the cheek.<br/>"Yoo-hoo, Tenchi!" Ryoko yelled from the roof. "What are you three doing<br/>up there?" he asked them. Washu just shrugged her shoulders. "Just hanging<br/>out." She said. "Where's grandpa?" Tenchi asked. "Saw him head up to the<br/>shrine." Says Ryoko. "And, your father went to town with Mr. Tendo and Mr.<br/>Saotome." Said Aeka.<br/>"Oh, ok." Tenchi replied with a smile.<br/>Sasami with Ryo-Ohki perched on her head came out carrying the first of<br/>several bowls of food. "Hi Tenchi, dinner is almost ready." She said.<br/>"Smells great Sasami." Says Ranma, and Sasami blushes. "Ukyo is making<br/>okonomiyaki." Said Sasami. "You know, Sasami, you, Ukyo and Shampoo could open<br/>a restaurant together and you'd probably make millions." Said Ranma. The little<br/>girl blushed even more furiously and giggled as she scampered back into the<br/>house.<br/>"Oh, by the way, speaking of Sasami I didn't tell you Tenchi but I met her<br/>other half." Ranma explained as they entered the house. "Her other half, oh,<br/>you mean you met Tsunami?" Tenchi replied doing a Spock Maneuver. Ranma nodded,<br/>"Yes, she came to me the day we both 'changed our lives forever'."<br/>"She has an uncanny tendency to do that." Said Tenchi with a smirk.<br/>"I still find it hard to believe that cute little girl is going to become<br/>her one day." Said Ranma. "Of all the girls here she had them all beat."<br/>Tenchi laughed, "Don't let Aeka and Ryoko hear you say that, them is<br/>fighting words, pilgrim." He tried using a John Wayne accent for that last<br/>part, but with his already thick oriental accent it came out sounding funny and<br/>the two nearly feel over laughing. Ranma hope Akane didn't hear him or he'd be<br/>on the wrong end of a mallet very soon.<br/>Ranma put his arm around Tenchi's shoulder and said, "We're both cursed<br/>with having incredibly beautiful women chasing us." Tenchi laughed, "It's gotta<br/>be a family trait or something." Ranma couldn't help it, he hit the floor<br/>laughing at the top of his lungs. Something told Tenchi that living at the<br/>Tendo house was going to be a very interesting adventure.<p>The Masaki family, Saotome family, and Tendo family sat at the outdoor<br/>dinner table. Tiki torches were set up around the patio for light, and there<br/>were a few candles on the table. The night air was warm with a soft, cool<br/>breeze flowing in over the lake. It was a perfect night for a dinner under the<br/>stars. The food was an incredible feast of flavors and textures. Some of it<br/>was made by Sasami, some by Ukyo and the rest by Shampoo. The three were<br/>masters of the culinary arts and this dinner showed there prowess in the kitchen<br/>was quite formidable. Sasami made more traditional Japanese dishes while Ukyo<br/>introduced the Masaki family to the unique dishes that were okonomiyaki, and<br/>Shampoo demonstrated that ramen didn't have to be boring.<br/>"Wow, Ranma had better have one hell of a metabolism because if he eats<br/>like this every night he'll start expanding." Laughed Ryoko.<br/>"Who, him?" Akane asked pointing a thumb Ranma's way. "He could eat like<br/>a horse and never gain a single pound. I hate him!" Ranma laughed and kissed<br/>her on the cheek.<br/>"So, Tenchi, Mr. Tendo tells me you decided to go to school in Nerima."<br/>Said Noboyuki. "It wasn't a hard decision, Nekomi Tech has better architecture<br/>classes, and at least in Nerima I'll have family there." Said Tenchi, the girls<br/>looked at him funny. "And also the girls can come and visit freely without<br/>raising too much suspicion."<br/>"It would be strange for girls to suddenly show up in your dorm room at<br/>all hours of the day and night." Said Katsuhito. The girls looked at one<br/>another and nodded in agreement. "Besides, Ranma's powers could still use some<br/>refinement and who better to help him than me." Tenchi said.<br/>"So the student becomes the teacher now, eh?" Says Katsuhito with a smirk.<br/>"Grandpa." Retorted Tenchi.<br/>"Just toying with you Tenchi." Said the old priest. "Yet, in truth you<br/>have learned all that I can teach you. Perhaps it is time for you to pass on<br/>what you have learned."<br/>"Maybe, if he is willing Tenchi could work with us as well and learn the<br/>Anything Goes style." Genma suggested. Katsuhito stifled a cringe. He learned<br/>to like the man who was his son-in-law, but he still thought his choice of<br/>martial arts disciplines needed serious reconsideration.<br/>"It sure is a beautiful night, not a cloud in the sky." Said Kasumi.<br/>"Yes, very beautiful." Shampoo agreed.<br/>Nabiki pointed into the sky and said, "There's a cloud, see that patch<br/>where there are no stars." Everyone looked up and indeed there was a patch of<br/>sky where there were no clouds. Suddenly, that area of darkness changed<br/>direction.<br/>Washu called up her translucent computer and said, "That is no cloud I'm<br/>afraid, it's a Juraian starship, and a first generation ship from the power<br/>output I'm reading here."<br/>Right on cue flood lights from the ship overhead began to shine down on<br/>the ground. The lights panned over the lake and then the house. The low rumble<br/>of the gravitic propulsion system of the Juraian ships began to fill the air as<br/>it got closer. Tenchi tried to tell whose ship it was from its silhouette, but<br/>Aeka recognized the ship first.<br/>"Its Lady Seto!" she announced.<br/>"Grandma Seto, hurray!" Sasami cheered.<br/>"What in the universe is she doing here?" asked Ryoko.<br/>"I don't know, she does have very interesting timing, and we have more<br/>than enough food for one more person at the table." Said Aeka. The ship slowly<br/>descended over the lake and stopped there. Everyone left the table and went to<br/>the edge of the lake to await whoever it was in the ship. The telltale light of<br/>a teleportation beam filled the air and a person materialized in front of them.<br/>When Sasami referred to Seto as 'grandma' Ranma was expecting a doddering<br/>old crone, but what greeted his eyes was anything but old. Seto had long teal<br/>hair with large bangs, here eyes were beautiful and intense. She was indeed<br/>very stunning and had an almost sensual air about her.<br/>"Grandma!" Sasami cheer as she ran towards the woman.<br/>"Oh, Sasami, darling I've missed you." Seto said as she caught the little<br/>girl in her arms. Aeka walked up in a more dignified manner and bowed<br/>respectfully. "Lady Seto, I'm pleased to see you, you're looking well." She<br/>said. Seto fixed her eye a cold eye that made Aeka cringe. "We aren't in the<br/>royal courts, and we are family Aeka." She said.<br/>"I'm sorry." The first princess apologized and received a hug from her<br/>grandmother. Seto fixed her eyes on Tenchi and it made the hair on the back of<br/>his neck stand up on end. "Well, you're still looking quite handsome Tenchi."<br/>Seto said to him, an almost seductive look in her eyes.<br/>"Uh, well, uh, I-" Tenchi tried to say but his tongue got I the way.<br/>"Lady Seto, I've heard quite a bit about you milady." Said Ranma.<br/>Seto looked at him and did a Spock Maneuver. "And who is this nice young<br/>man?" she asked. "I am Ranma Saotome, Tenchi's cousin and grandson to Lord<br/>Yosho." Ranma replied.<br/>For the very first and probably last time ever Aeka saw a startled look on<br/>Seto's face. It wasn't often the Devil Princess of Jurai was taken off guard.<br/>She smiled at Ranma, looked him up and down and then turned to Katsuhito.<br/>"Well, it seems you've been keeping secrets from me Yosho." She smirked.<br/>"I was unaware of his existence only until earlier this year." The old<br/>priest told her truthfully. "I see." Says Seto.<br/>"He possesses the Jurai Power." Katsuhito added.<br/>Seto's smile broadened, Aeka remembered seeing that smile before just<br/>before Seto had some interesting idea. "Does he now." She said.<br/>"Don't go playing match maker yet, Seto." Washu spoke up. "He's already<br/>engaged, to three very lovely ladies." Seto look also disappointed at that then<br/>turned back to Tenchi. "I am also engaged, to Aeka, Ryoko, Mihoshi, Washu, and<br/>Sasami." He said. Seto's smile became a Cheshire cat grin. "You're taking all<br/>the fun out of this for me you know that." She said.<br/>"I'll assume then your visit isn't just a social call." Katsuhito guessed.<br/>Seto nodded, "Azusa sent to me to request that Tenchi make his intentions<br/>towards Aeka, Sasami, or anyone, and if he doesn't I was to step in."<br/>"Lovely." Said Ryoko sarcastically.<br/>"Nice to see you too Ryoko." Seto replied with the same tone.<p>The rest of the night was a very happy affair. Seto was very impressed<br/>with Ukyo and Shampoo's cooking. Despite the fact that she made the trip to<br/>Earth for nothing she decided to make the most of it by getting to know the<br/>newest members of the royal family. Ranma was very fascinating to her, not that<br/>she was interested in him, she was happily married to a man she loved very much.<br/>She wanted to learn all she could about him. He was in the line of succession<br/>to the throne after all. Later on, Aeka and Washu took her to the side to speak<br/>to Seto privately.<br/>"I do know why you want to talk to me." Said Seto.<br/>"Good, the first step is out of the way then." Said Washu. "I'll get to<br/>the point, who would most likely become a threat to Ranma?"<br/>Seto waved her hand at Washu. "The usual suspects, Seiryuu's rather<br/>dysfunctional rabble for one." Seto said. "The same who challenged the validity<br/>of Tenchi's heritage." Washu said in a matter of fact tone.<br/>"I doubt they would try to do the same here since it is establish that he<br/>is Yosho's grandson." Seto said. "The Holy Council ruled that is enough to<br/>determine validity of lineage, the same would hold true for Ranma."<br/>"I just don't want something unexpectedly to come out of the blue on us."<br/>Said Washu. "Yes, we must protect Lord Ranma until he has learned knowledge<br/>enough about the Jurai political system to protect himself." Aeka added.<br/>"Do not worry, I will see to it that none dare come." Said Seto. "Believe<br/>me when I say I can guarantee no one from the royal family will come here to<br/>make trouble."<br/>"Thank you grandmother." Aeka smiled.<br/>"Grandmother, instead of Lady Seto, there is hope for you yet Aeka." Seto<br/>smiled back.<p>With Lady Seto staying the night Tenchi decided to take the couch. He<br/>couldn't stay with the girls because they were bunking with Akane's sisters.<br/>Tenchi fluffed up his pillow and got ready to lay down when he felt a sudden,<br/>slight gust of air behind him. He felt that sort of effect for several years<br/>now and he knew it was the sign of one thing and one thing only. A pair of arms<br/>wrapped around him from behind, a pair of soft breasts pressed into his back.<br/>"Hi, Ryoko." He said with a smile.<br/>"How you know it's me?" she asked.<br/>"Who else teleports behind me and presses her, you know, into my back like<br/>that." He told her turning around to look her in the eye. Ryoko tightened her<br/>hold on him and laughed. It was so good to be able to hold him without him<br/>fighting me off., she thought.<br/>"Come to tuck me in?" Tenchi asked.<br/>"Actually, I couldn't sleep." She said.<br/>"Kagato?" he asked her, knowing the answer before she even said it. Ryoko<br/>rested her head on his shoulder and he reached back and patted her arm. "He's<br/>gone for good now." He reassured her.<br/>"Tokimi is gone, she can't bring him back." He went on.<br/>Tenchi felt moisture on his shoulder. She's crying., he told himself.<br/>Tenchi turned around onto his knees wrapping his arms around the beautiful ex-<br/>space pirate. Her shoulders began to shake as the sobs came. Tenchi didn't say<br/>anything, he just let her cry it out. Damn you Kagato, you had better stay dead<br/>this time you bastard!, thought Tenchi. He tightened his embrace pulling her<br/>closer to him.<br/>"I love you Tenchi." Ryoko spoke softly into his ear.<br/>"I love you too." He told her just as softly.<br/>Ryoko pulled back just enough to look into Tenchi's eyes. She could see<br/>the compassionate look I his eyes, but this time it was combined with love.<br/>Tenchi did something she wasn't expecting at that moment, he kissed her. It was<br/>a long, romantic kiss, like the ones she'd dreamed of. In fact, they 'were'<br/>finally together, but it was Tenchi who had made the first move. Ryoko returned<br/>his kiss which was deeper and filled with longing. This went on for several<br/>minutes, the two exchanging kisses as their hands began to rove about. Tenchi<br/>pulled Ryoko up over the back of the couch and laid back with Ryoko on top of<br/>him.<br/>"Please." Ryoko pleaded longingly.<br/>Tenchi didn't nose bleed, but instead blushed. He knew what she wanted,<br/>and strangely enough it was what 'he' wanted also.<br/>"I need you." She went on softly.<br/>Tenchi kissed her softly as his hands began to work the buttons of her<br/>nightshirt. "I need you too." He whispered. Ryoko's eyes went wide with<br/>surprise, she tried to speak but Tenchi's next kiss silenced her.<br/>"Oh, Tenchi." Ryoko cooed later, tears forming in her eyes.<br/>"Don't cry." Tenchi whispered.<br/>Ryoko wiped the tears away and said, "They're tears of joy."<br/>Tenchi let Ryoko's nightshirt fall to the floor just as she was almost<br/>done with his. When he's shirt hit the floor next to hers Tenchi pulled his<br/>sheet over them. The feeling of Ryoko's soft skin against his turned the fire<br/>inside of him into a roaring blaze. The living room was dark now with only the<br/>light of the moon shining outside. Tenchi left behind any misgivings he had<br/>concerning Ryoko, he knew how he really felt about her, how he always felt but<br/>could never admit it. He expressed those feelings on the living room couch that<br/>night, a night Ryoko would cherish for the rest of her existence.<p>The entire family gathered outside the next morning to see Lady Seto off.<br/>The beautiful, green haired matriarch of the Masaki Royal Family waved farewell<br/>to everyone before her ship's teleportation beam locked on. Her massive<br/>starship of Juraian wood, wood stronger than the strongest metal on Earth,<br/>lifted up away from the lake and soared rapidly through the sky. Everyone<br/>watched until the massive ship could no longer be seen.<br/>"Question, can Ranma get big spaceship too?" Shampoo asked.<br/>"If he's summoned he will." Aeka told her.<br/>"Summoned?" Akane said questioningly.<br/>"Yes, by the trees, every member of the royal family with exception of<br/>Tenchi has been called by a royal tree to become its bondmate." Aeka explained.<br/>"I remember you telling us about that in the onsen a while back." Said<br/>Nabiki. "What's this about trees calling people?" Ukyo asked.<br/>"You know that big tree where we talked the other day?" Ranma asked her.<br/>Ukyo smiled warmly and nodded, she would always remember that place in her<br/>heart. "Well, that tree is like a big living computer and it was a part of my<br/>grandfather's spaceship when it crashed here seven hundred years ago."<br/>"You mean that tree no from Earth." Shampoo asked in surprise.<br/>"The tree is called Fonaho-Oh, same name as my great grandmother on<br/>Jurai." Said Tenchi.<br/>"The trees speak to us telepathically, and those bonded with a tree is<br/>given the gift of a very long life." Aeka explained.<br/>"Like how long?" Ukyo asked. Aeka looked at Tenchi and wondered if it was<br/>a good idea to tell them. She sighed and he nodded his head and she said, "When<br/>my brother's mother, Fonaho, left the Earth to live on Jurai with our father as<br/>his queen Japan was still in the feudal era."<br/>"WHAT?" both Ukyo and Shampoo cried at once.<br/>"My father is very close to four thousand years old, and will likely live<br/>another eight or ten thousand years." Aeka continued.<br/>"That mean Shampoo be old and gray and Ranma still be young and handsome!"<br/>Shampoo gasped in horror. Ukyo had a look on her face that was very heard to<br/>read. Akane just gripped a little tighter onto Ranma's arm. "Don't worry, as<br/>his wives you too will be a part of the royal family and as such will one day be<br/>summoned also." Aeka said to reassure them. "After all, Fonaho is one hundred<br/>percent human and the trees called upon her." Washu explained.<br/>"Then, we won't grow old while Ranma stays young?" Akane asked.<br/>"You won't." Washu smiled.<br/>The girls all sighed with relief and grabbed onto Ranma. "We get to spend<br/>thousands of years with the man we love." Ukyo cooed as she wrapped her arms<br/>around Ranma.<p>I can't believe we'll be back home tomorrow., Akane thought as she looked<br/>out over the lake from the upstairs balcony. She was growing used to the beauty<br/>of the mountains around her. Life in the city was so different, so busy and<br/>chaotic. She had to look forward though, when they return to Nerima things will<br/>not be going back to what could be called normal. At about mid summer Tenchi<br/>will be coming to live with them to get ready for fall classes in college with<br/>Ranma. There was also the situation between her, Ranma, Ukyo and Shampoo.<br/>Nothing definite has been worked out yet thought on how they were going to<br/>manage the whole thing. The Tendo house wasn't as spacious as Tenchi's place<br/>and the land plot it was on wasn't large enough for any major renovations expect<br/>to add another floor.<br/>Akane heard the van door open and saw her father and Noboyuki carrying<br/>luggage. Mr. Saotome was on top of the van checking cargo straps that were<br/>holding something. It was covered in a tarp so she couldn't see what it was.<br/>Akane hadn't seen it before, it was large, and it wasn't luggage. She left the<br/>balcony and made her way downstairs. She came out of the house and looked up at<br/>the thing on the van.<br/>"Mr. Saotome, what is that?" she asked pointing at the thing in the tarp.<br/>The balding man scratched his head and said, "Uh, it's a little something<br/>your father purchased in town the other day." Akane climbed the rear cargo<br/>ladder on the van's back door and looked under the tarp. The object was a huge<br/>stone statue. Akane gasped at the immense craftsmanship of the stone carving,<br/>it almost looked alive. The statue was of a man, she could see the head but<br/>because of the straps she couldn't see much of the body.<br/>"What's that thing?" she heard Ranma ask behind her. The young Saotome<br/>had silently climbed up the ladder behind her. "Its something my Dad bought."<br/>She told him. "Where the heck is he going to put it?" Ranma asked after jumping<br/>down to the ground. "In the yard, and I got a perfect place for it." Soun said<br/>with a smile as he stowed a suitcase into the van.<p>Washu tapped a few commands into her translucent computer, the access door<br/>to her holodeck opened slowly. A dazed Happosai stumbled out on uneasy legs.<br/>The diminutive martial arts master and mega-pervert looked up at Washu through<br/>blurry eyes. "That was the most incredible experience of my entire life, now I<br/>can die a happy man." He slurred.<br/>"You'll get your wish if you don't behave yourself for the next day and a<br/>half." She warned him. "Or do I have to stick you back in there and boot up my<br/>"Rocky Horror" program." Happosai's eyes shot open in an expression of absolute<br/>terror. "Good, now go and be a good little pervert." Washu said as she waved<br/>him off. The tiny old man ran off as if his life depended on it; which wasn't<br/>too far from the truth.<p>Ranma was enjoying would could be his last trip to the onsen. He was<br/>going to miss this place, it was so relaxing. You can really sit here and think<br/>things through., he said to himself. He thought about the girls, Akane, Ukyo<br/>and Shampoo. He thought about what they were going to do after returning to<br/>Nerima. He was still going to live with the Tendo's but what about the other<br/>girls. Would they still live where they do now or would they also be moving in,<br/>after all his Dad and Mr. Tendo encouraged him to share a room with the girls<br/>here. The house was small as it is with everybody there, now Tenchi was going<br/>to be there around Fall. That was something Ranma was looking forward to. He<br/>really liked his cousin and looked up to him. There was something else crossing<br/>Ranma's mind, after learning about his and Akane's intimacy the other two girls<br/>have grown more 'affectionate' towards him. The young Saotome had to smile<br/>though, they really were very beautiful, knockouts really. Yet, that wasn't why<br/>he loved Akane, she was pretty but wasn't what you would call a knockout. It<br/>who she is and not what she looked like that made him love her. I guess the<br/>same thing could be said about Ukyo and Shampoo., he thought. Ukyo was very<br/>sweet, very beautiful, and a great cook. Shampoo turned heads wherever she<br/>went, but beneath that pretty face and voluptuous body was a person with a<br/>strong will, a generally good heart, and an immense devotion to the man she<br/>loved over any other. Ranma could not help but feel sorry for Mousse who<br/>devoted much of his life to trying to earn Shampoo's love, but only succeed in<br/>being shot down in a fiery crash. Then, there was Ryoga and Kuno. Ranma wasn't<br/>sure about them, he had a feeling he would not see the last of them despite what<br/>Akane said. Once a stubborn mule always a stubborn mule., he told himself.<br/>There was also Kuno's nut ball sister, Ranma was a little afraid to find out<br/>what her reaction to his new relationship with the girls would be.<br/>Ranma was so deep in thought that he didn't hear the door to the onsen<br/>open and shut. He didn't hear the sound of bare feet on the wood floor<br/>approaching his pool or the sound of fine silken clothes falling to the ground.<br/>A pair of hands came around and covered his eyes, Ranma froze as solid as a<br/>block of ice.<br/>"Guess who." Came a soft voice from behind. Shampoo's voice!<br/>Ranma whipped around, his eyes went wide as he suddenly took in the sight<br/>before him. Shampoo stood kneeling on her knees at the edge of the pool wearing<br/>absolutely nothing. Ranma had seen her in a swim suit before but could never<br/>imagine she looked that beautiful. "Uh, Shampoo, I, uh, was just, uh-" he<br/>stammered.<br/>The voluptuous Chinese Amazon warrior produced a bath sponge from behind<br/>her back. "Shampoo scrub Ranma's back." She smiled. It had always been his<br/>instinct to pry Shampoo off of him whenever she glomped him. It wasn't because<br/>he didn't like her, it was because he didn't know what would happen if he ever<br/>let himself loose control. When a girl as lovely as her grabs onto you your<br/>first thought isn't to run away.<br/>"Uh, ok." He replied. Shampoo's eyes shined with immense delight as she<br/>sank into the water and waded over to him. She turned him around and began to<br/>slowly scrub his back up and down. This went on for a while until Ranma decided<br/>to do something he would normally have never done. Without turning he reach<br/>back, wrapped his arm gently around Shampoo's neck and drew her into a kiss.<br/>The young woman's entire body shuddered with electrifying delight. They had<br/>shared a "so called" kiss once before when Mamolin kidnapped her, but she was a<br/>cat at the time. This was their first "passionate" kiss, ever.<br/>"Ranma love Shampoo, for real?" she asked softly looking into his eyes for<br/>the answer. "I know that I really care about you, maybe I do love you, I guess<br/>its something that will get stronger as we spend more time together." He<br/>answered her. "Shampoo love Ranma with all her heart." The Chinese girl<br/>whispered. Ranma turned and kissed her again as he took her into his arms.<br/>Ranma let go of that mental lock he had whenever Shampoo was around. His<br/>passion was unleashed, his kisses became more sensual. Ranma's hand slid up her<br/>body and cupped one of her generously proportioned feminine attributes sending a<br/>delicious shockwave through Shampoo's body.<br/>"Shampoo dream of this, she dream to have Ranma in arms, to make love to<br/>Ranma." She whispered into his ear. With that said, Ranma drew her closer into<br/>his arms and made her dreams come true.<p>The day had finally come. Tenchi and Ranma loaded up the last of the<br/>luggage into the van while the family all gathered outside to exchange their<br/>farewells. It was going to be almost a year before they saw each other again.<br/>Many things had been discussed that morning at the breakfast table. For one,<br/>Ukyo and Shampoo could move into the Tendo home if they wanted and stay in<br/>Ranma's room. Soun had the right downstairs closet chosen for Washu's lab<br/>entrance, and the pink haired genius offered to assist with the overcrowding<br/>problem in the house.<br/>"I can either add another floor making the house taller, or I can expand<br/>the room using subspace." She offered.<br/>"Subspace would be fine, especially after what I saw what you can do with<br/>it in your lab." Soun said gratefully.<br/>Tenchi closed the van door and walked with Ranma over to where the family<br/>was assembled. Noboyuki had his video camera out, the girls were sobbing and<br/>hugging each other, and Katsuhito was as stoic as ever. Despite the many lows<br/>the family reunion was a success, the old priest felt like things had finally<br/>come full circle. Now only the future lay ahead of them.<br/>"Tenchi will be arriving in mid June to prepare for his classes."<br/>Katsuhito said. "We'll be ready to welcome him with open arms." Soun smiled.<br/>"I guess this is it, I sure hate having to leave this beautiful scenery<br/>and fresh air." Said Akane. "It was fun, but I have a few business deals I've<br/>got to check up on when we get back home." Nabiki said. "And my garden is<br/>probably all full of weeds." Kasumi sighed.<br/>"We will miss you, we had lots of fun since they guys came here." Said<br/>Ryoko. "Yeah, thanks to Happosai I was able to get lots of data on perverts in<br/>their natural environment." Washu said happily. Aeka and Ryoko both rolled<br/>their eyes. The diminutive letch let out a groan, then ran away quickly when<br/>Washu began humming a few bars of "Time Warp". "Having a few extra hands in the<br/>kitchen was fun." Sasami smiled. "Miya." Meowed Ryu-Ohki from her perch on top<br/>of Sasami's head.<br/>Ranma and Tenchi said their farewells to one another as did Mr. Tendo and<br/>Mr. Saotome. The addition of Ukyo and Shampoo to the entourage made for very<br/>cramped quarters in the van, but Akane and Ranma didn't mind that anymore. The<br/>young Saotome watched the Masaki family waving goodbye as the van pulled away<br/>from the house for the last time. He sighed, it was over. It seemed so unreal<br/>that they were returning to Nerima.<br/>Many things had changed during the summer, his relationship with Akane was<br/>one of them, and his new relationship with Shampoo and Ukyo was another.<br/>Tenchi's unique situation was very interesting and Ranma wished him a lot of<br/>luck dealing with his "harem". Life back in Nerima wasn't going to be quite<br/>back to normal for them all since the girls were going to move into the Tendo<br/>house. Ranma wasn't quite sure how Cologne was going to take all of is, she<br/>expected Ranma to return to the Amazon village and China so Shampoo could bed<br/>him and make a lot of little warriors for the clan. Not that was a bad thing<br/>after experiencing love making with Shampoo in the onsen. That girl was quite<br/>'talented'., thought Ranma. There was Kodachi Kuno, the thought of what she<br/>would do when she learns of all this scared the crap out of him. He thought<br/>about this all before but now he was certain the danger he faced before back<br/>home was going to be nothing compared to what he was going to face now.<br/>Something beautiful started that summer, new love was sown in the fertile<br/>Earth and quickly sprouted with new life. Marriage was still a long way off, at<br/>least until Tenchi and Ranma graduated college. Yet, the two young men had<br/>reached that point of no return. They could not undo the decisions they made to<br/>change their destiny even if they wanted to. But, they didn't want to. The<br/>love that bound Tenchi and the girls and Ranma and this girls would only grow<br/>from tiny sprouts into a magnificent tree reaching high into the air. They<br/>would become shining lights in a dark world. The bright future was ahead of<br/>them shining with the glow of a million suns. Only the gods knew what<br/>challenges they would face when the time came.<p>TO BE CONTINUED!<p>COMING SOON:<p>TENCHI 1/2: THE HIKARU KUNO STORY<br/>Almost a year has passed and Tenchi is now living at the Tendo Dojo awaiting the<br/>start of Fall college classes. Life for the family in Nerima seems normal,<br/>normal for them, but something strange begins to happen when Kasumi gets a<br/>sudden fascination with the 'startlingly lifelike' statue Mr. Tendo purchased in<br/>Ohkayama.
