</div>Disclaimer: Most of the characters used in the story are creations of the great Rumiko Takahashi.<p>Author's Note: Hello! Again, thank you so much for your reviews. I'm sorry for the delay of this chapter. I was just terribly busy last week. I hope this chapter is worth the wait. By the way, there are references to episodes from the animated series (Just a spoiler alert!). Another warning, this chapter's a bit waffy so please bear with me. Anyway, enjoy and keep those reviews coming!<p>Again,<p>"..." for speech<p>{...} for thoughts<p>THE NECKLACE<p>by Raven Nyx<p>Chapter 3<p>Soft smiling silver gray eyes. A warm smile showing off pearly white teeth. A handsomely chiseled face crowned with short dark brown hair.<p>"Whoa! I'm not going to hurt you."<p>Akane in a fighting stance faced a boy of around eighteen holding up his hands in surrender. He was tall, maybe as tall as Ranma. He was wearing a dark blue gi that clung to his broad shoulders and lean body and an immaculate white hakama that hid powerful legs. He was a martial artist – a kendoist to be exact – evinced by the sheathed sword hanging from his belt.<p>Confusion and uncertainty flickered in Akane's brown eyes. {What the...Is he my challenger? Why? Yet I don't feel any danger from him.} She felt her strength and resolve waver as her adrenaline level dropped. {He's trying to catch you off guard!} Warning bells in her head went off.<p>The boy took a step towards her.<p>"DON'T!" Akane exclaimed. She took a step back. Her hand tightly clutched her school bag, ready to be used as a weapon or a shield. Her body again coiled and set for action. {See...}<p>He frowned. "Please," he pleaded, his deep voice husky and soothing. "I'm not going to harm you. I just wanted to meet you and maybe get to know you."<p>She stared at him blankly, hearing him but not understanding a word. {Meet? Get to know?}<p>"I—I... uh, I was the one who sent you th—the note and... umm... the carnation," he stammered. He stared down at his feet trying to hide the blush that spread across his face but his crimson ears betrayed him.<p>It took a few seconds before what he said hit her. {Note... carnation...} "Oh!"<p>Her tense body instantly relaxed. The absurdity of how she had misunderstood the note and carnation and the situation she was in dawned on her and again, uncontrollable laughter bubbled up inside of her. She tried hard to stifle it as he sincerely said sorry and gave a quick bow of apology, but she couldn't help it and she burst out laughing.<p>The boy stood stunned for a second but her laughter was so infectious that he started laughing as well. They both stopped after a few minutes. Akane was wiping tears off her face when she caught him watching her with an amused smile touching his lips. She suddenly felt conscious of how she looked. She quickly smoothed her hair. Her cheeks were on fire.<p>"No... No, I'M sorry." She bowed low both in apology and in an attempt to hide her blushing face. "I misunderstood the note. Sorry."<p>She heard the quick shuffle of feet and cloth and felt the boy's hands on her shoulders gently pushing her erect. She stared up at deep silver gray pools.<p>"We'll call it even then," he said with a boyish grin. "By the way, I'm Shiro, Sakamoto Shiro."<p>Akane was drowning in his eyes. A distant blare of a car horn brought her back to earth. Realizing how foolish, how unlike her she was acting, she mentally gave herself a kick. {Snap out of it, Akane!}<p>"Hi! My name is Akane, Tendo Akane." She offered her hand and he took it in a firm handshake.<p>Without letting go, he tugged Akane gently towards the cherry blossom tree and said, "Come. I've prepared snacks for us."<p>She gazed at the warm hand covering hers and she couldn't help but smile. She let herself be led towards a picnic blanket set under the tree. She looked at it in surprise. Neither the picnic blanket nor the basket on it was there awhile ago. But she shrugged it off as merely an oversight just like her failure to see Shiro who was probably hidden by the tree's shadow.<p>Shiro let go of her hand and knelt down on the blanket taking out two sandwiches and two sodas from the basket.<p>"Sit, sit," he said as he handed her a sandwich.<p>"Thanks!" Akane gratefully took it and plopped down beside him. Despite having eaten a banana split just that afternoon, she was famished and started wolfing down her sandwich.<p>"I hope I didn't frighten you," Shiro said as he opened his soda can.<p>"No, not at all," Akane said before taking another big bite. After chewing thoughtfully, she changed her answer. "Well, maybe a bit." Akane grinned sheepishly. "So Sakamoto-san— "<p>"Please call me Shiro."<p>"Shiro," Akane repeated, rolling the name in her tongue. The name had a familiar feel and ring to it. "Umm... how do you know me? I mean, have we met before or something?"<p>"Well, how could I not know such a beautiful girl?" he said matter-of- factly flashing her another boyish grin.<p>Flattered but determined to get an answer, she smirked. "Uh-huh..."<p>"Okay, okay. I met you twice already."<p>"Really?"<p>Baffled, Akane stared at him trying to recall his face. What he said rang true but she couldn't remember. He was familiar to her – his name, his eyes, his smile – yet she had no memory of him.<p>"Well, maybe 'met' is not the right term." He grinned. "I first saw you in an interschool drama competition. It was a production of Romeo and Juliet. You played Juliet."<p>Akane didn't know whether to be embarrassed or proud of that production. Embarrassed because it was a disaster. Three Romeos. Two Juliets. A drunken master scene with Juliet-Ranma as the drunken master. Maybe proud of it because they actually won the competition even though the prize wasn't what they expected and... she got through the kissing scene with Ranma. She smiled.<p>"And the second time?"<p>"It was at the Miss Beachside competition."<p>Now Akane was embarrassed. She wouldn't have joined that competition if it hadn't been for Shampoo challenging her. She didn't even win. Kasumi did.<p>"So you just saw me and decided you wanted to meet me?" she asked skeptically.<p>"Yeah!" Shiro smiled. "I wanted to know you."<p>{Wow!} she thought. {I'm flattered.} He was so unlike the guys in school. He was mature and charming. So unlike her fiancé. {I hope this is not some kind of prank.} She looked around suspiciously.<p>"Is there anything wrong?" Shiro asked with concern.<p>"Nothing." She smiled at him reassuringly. "So, tell me about yourself?"<p>"I'm eighteen, a student at...," he talked animatedly about himself. But as he went on with the half-truths and lies he had skillfully woven, his mind drifted towards a distant memory. {Chiyo-chan...}<p>********<p>A girl wearing a yellow and blue kimono embroidered with majestic cranes near the hem stood under the shade of a cherry blossom tree. It was late afternoon and the rose-dappled sky gradually darkened as the sun set. A strong breeze blew past her, lifting her long blue-black hair tied in a half-ponytail by a yellow silk ribbon and sending a rain of blossoms to fall around her.<p>A boy in a white gi and a dark brown hakama appeared in the midst of the shower and intently walked towards the girl.<p>She heard his approach and whipped around to face him. The girl was Akane.<p>"Chiyo-chan."<p>"Shiro-kun," Chiyo said happily. She ran towards Shiro and flung her arms around him. For awhile, they warmly held each other. The cherry blossom tree, the wind and the setting sun were silent witnesses to their affection.<p>"I have a gift for you." Shiro reached in his gi and took out a velvet box.<p>"What is it?" she asked, her eyes glittering with excitement.<p>He gave it to her and smiled shyly. "Open it."<p>Blushing, she gingerly opened the box. She gasped. Inside the box was a gold necklace.<p>He reverently took the necklace out of the box. Dangling from the necklace was a blue teardrop pendant. He placed it around her neck and deftly fastened it. It gleamed in the fading light of the afternoon.<p>"It's beautiful, Shiro." she touched the necklace and looked deeply into Shiro's eyes. "Thank you!" She smiled.<p>He placed his right hand gently on her cheek.<p>She covered his warm hand with hers.<p>They kissed as another breeze sent a rain of blossoms that enveloped them in bliss.<p>********<p>The sun had already set. The early night sky was dotted with a few stars. Lampposts were already lit casting its soft light around the park<p>For the past hour, Shiro told her about himself – his family, his childhood, his studies and his interests. In turn, she talked a little about herself – her family, the dojo and her interests. She purposely left out the part about being engaged. She wasn't comfortable revealing it to someone she just met. It was too personal.<p>She immensely enjoyed his company. He was interesting. {Practices kendo, well traveled, has a good sense of humor, seems like a complete gentleman, he's good looking} – she smiled inwardly – {and... and he's NORMAL!} That was what made him so intriguing to Akane. He was NORMAL. He lived a normal life. He was a breath of fresh air in Akane's life. He wasn't cursed. He wasn't a cross-dresser, a megalomaniac, a prince of some sort or a voodoo practitioner. He wasn't hopelessly forgetful, eternally lost, completely perverted or madly in love with her older sister. He was simply Shiro... well, so far...<p>"...and they all laughed. I avoided skating ever since," Shiro concluded his story about his sorry attempt at ice-skating as a kid.<p>"Well, maybe I can teach you a thing or two about skating," she boasted, flashing him a brilliant smile. It was almost dinnertime. Kasumi was expecting her to be home before dinner so Akane regretfully had to end their picnic. "Anyway, I have to get going, Shiro. I really had a great time. Thanks!" She took a final sip of her soda and a drop rolled down her chin. "Whoops!"<p>As she reached up to wipe it off, Shiro beat her to it. He gently placed his hand on her cheek and lightly brushed his thumb on her chin to wipe the drop off. At that moment, time stopped. She became painfully aware of the warmth of his hand and the deafening and rapid beating of her heart. Overwhelmed, she quickly pulled away. Time resumed. The moment was lost.<p>She grabbed her bag and hastily stood up. "I have to go." She did not dare look at him for he might see that she was flustered. "Bye." She turned to leave but he gently caught her wrist.<p>"I'll be here same time tomorrow." And with these words, he let go.<p>Without a word, she stiffly walked away. When she was out of the park, she ran home.
