</div>Disclaimer: Characters used in the story are creations of the great Rumiko Takahashi.<p>Author's Note: Hello! Thank you so much for your reviews. I'm glad that you enjoyed the first chapter. I hope you'll also enjoy this one. Keep those reviews coming!<p>Again,<p>"..." for speech<p>{...} for thoughts<p>THE NECKLACE<p>by Raven Nyx<p>Chapter 2<p>Akane gradually opened her eyes. The sweet humming of the birds greeted her early in the morning. {Another school day}, she sighed.<p>Yawning, she stretched her arms over her head and reluctantly sat up on her bed. She still felt sleepy. She peered at her clock. It was 8:24 am... 8:24 am! A sudden surge of panic coursed through her body at the thought of being late for school again. She was seldom late for school but since Ranma came, she had been late numerous times. Despite the fact that being late has already become a "habit", she still couldn't stand it.<p>She roughly rubbed the sleep off her eyes and looked at the clock again. It was 6:25 am. She giggled at her mistake. {At least now, I'm definitely wide-awake}, she thought.<p>She quickly stood up and started fixing her bed. As she was folding her blanket, she suddenly felt a light cold breeze touch her bare arms. She shivered. {That's odd.}<p>She looked at her bedroom window and was surprised to see it wide open, the curtains swaying in the soft morning breeze. {Must have left it open}, she shrugged and walked towards the window to close it.<p>When she got to her desk, she parted the curtains and slid the window shut with a thud. As she was about to close the curtains again, something on her desk caught her eye.<p>To her amazement, lying on her desk was a beautiful red carnation. She rapidly blinked a number of times to test whether it was just her imagination. The carnation was still there. Tucked underneath it was a folded note – TO AKANE. {I wonder who's this from}, she thought as she picked up and unfolded the note. It read:<p>Akane,<p>Meet me at the park under the cherry blossom tree near the lake at 5:00 pm. I'll be waiting.<p>S.S.<p>A challenge letter. {Don't tell me it's another one of Ranma's fiancées}, she groaned. {But who? Ukyo? Kodachi?} She eyed the carnation warily assuming it might be laced with sleeping powder. {Hmm... S.S.? Don't tell me it's Shampoo? S.S. – Saotome Shampoo? The nerve!} In rage, her hand tightened on the letter. She quickly checked herself and took deep breaths to calm herself. {Or maybe it's from a new one? Well, tough luck}, she thought smugly. {I'm not goin —}<p>Her thoughts were suddenly interrupted when her bedroom door swung wide open. Happosai quickly scurried in.<p>"Come back 'ere, you old freak!" screamed a very upset girl-type Ranma wearing a drenched white tank top and yellow and blue boxers as she rushed into Akane's room. "That's the last time you'll try to put a bra on me while I'm sleeping!"<p>Happosai hopped on to Akane's bed. "Can't an old man have his fun?" he said teary-eyed rubbing a lacy white bra to his cheek for comfort.<p>"Not with me, you ain't!" Ranma gave Happosai a kick. He missed.<p>"I'm not asking for much!" Happosai whined. "I just want to see you wearing this exquisite piece of underwear, the best in my collection!" The old man waived the lacy item at Ranma.<p>"No way, you lecher!" Ranma angrily stomped her foot and threw a punch at the old man.<p>Again, he missed. Happosai evaded Ranma's punch and nimbly leapt on her red head. "You understand, don't you?" the old man asked as he made a leap for Akane's bosom. "Akane-chaaannnn!"<p>"Eeeeyaaaaa!" Akane's eyes fluttered shut as she reflexively clenched her right fist and did an uppercut. It hit its target. Happosai broke through the ceiling and flew out into the morning sky.<p>Panting, Akane slowly opened her eyes, her left hand tightly clenched her chest in an effort to slow her racing heart.<p>"Nice punch, Akane!" Ranma gave her a quick salute as she started walking towards the door. "You're really such a macho chick."<p>"What did you say?" Akane's mallet quickly materialized in her hands.<p>"Nothing, nothing!" Ranma quickly ran out of the door.<p>"The nerve! And so early in the morning," Akane muttered as she roughly brushed off splinters and dust from her hair and shoulders and stomped off to prepare for school.<p>The note lay on the floor crumpled and dusty and forgotten after the chaos.<p>********<p>Upon hearing the school bell ring, Furinkan High students started standing up and putting their books and notebooks in their bags. It signaled the end of the school day. Corridors were filled with the laughter and chatter of students rushing out of the building.<p>As Akane was shoving her notebooks and books in her bag, a note slipped from her algebra book and fluttered on to the floor. She leaned down to pick it up.<p>"What the..." Akane said in surprise. It was the same note she received that morning. {Weird}, she thought. {I know I left this note at home.} She quickly looked around searching for the possible perpetrator. Everyone seemed to be going about his or her business. She scanned the note again.<p>"Hey, Akane!"<p>Akane almost jumped out of her seat. Her friends, Yuka and Sayuri, looked at her in disbelief.<p>"You okay, Akane?" Sayuri said with concern. "You're kinda jumpy."<p>Akane nodded and gave them a sheepish grin. "I'm fine. Just fine." She tucked the note back into her algebra book, which she hastily stuffed into her bag.<p>As Akane and her friends wended their way along the corridor, Yuka asked excitedly, "So, are you up for a movie?"<p>"Yeah!"<p>Akane sounded less enthusiastic than she usually would be. She kept thinking of the letter tucked in her algebra book. Her curiosity was piqued. Who was this very persistent challenger? Was she ready to fight? Could she win? In the first place, why was she being challenged? So many questions unanswered. So many questions...<p>********<p>The sky was burning bright orange and red signaling the setting of the sun. Akane walked briskly towards the park. {I hope I'm not yet too late}, she thought anxiously. Yet part of her wished that she were.<p>Two hours ago...<p>"Why don't we grab a bite to eat before the movie?" Akane suggested as she, Yuka and Sayuri rounded a corner to the movie theater. "I think we still have about an hour and a half to kill before the movie starts."<p>"Good idea, Akane," Sayuri replied as she rubbed her tummy. "I'm starving."<p>After an hour, Yuka, Sayuri and Akane were finished with their banana splits and parfaits. Yuka and Sayuri were excitedly talking about the movie they were about to watch. Akane was staring at her empty bowl while fingering her pendant. {Park... cherry blossom tree... near the lake... 5:00 pm... I'll be waiting... Akane... cherry blossom tree... 5:00 pm...} The contents of the note ran through her mind again and again like a broken record player. She didn't know what to do. Part of her wanted to ignore it. It would just be a waste of time. But part of her, a larger part of her wanted to find out what it was all about and satisfy her curiosity. What harm would it do?<p>"...perfect for the role. Right, Akane?" Sayuri looked at Akane. "Akane?"<p>"Hellooooo?" Yuka waved her hand in front of Akane's face. "Earth to Akane."<p>"Huh?" Akane snapped back to reality. "Umm... Oh yeah, Principal Kuno is pretty crazy. No wonder his children are also a bit neurotic." Akane chuckled wryly.<p>"That was the topic awhile ago," said Sayuri in disbelief. "We're already talking about the movie. Akane, are you okay? You've spaced out again. It's like the third time in the past hour."<p>"If it's Ranma, we understand." Yuka teased grinning mischievously.<p>"R—Ranma?" Akane blushed furiously and turned her face away. "Of course not! What do I care about that idiot!"<p>"Whatever you say, Akane."<p>Yuka and Sayuri shared a knowing look and amused smiles.<p>"One ticket please." Yuka slipped the money to the cashier at the ticket booth. The girls left the ice cream parlor at around half past four to buy tickets for the movie.<p>Akane rifled through her bag for her wallet. She was next in line to Yuka. Sayuri was waiting for them by the popcorn stand.<p>"Found it!" She said triumphantly as it was her turn to buy a ticket. Suddenly, she gasped. She pulled out not only her wallet but also the note she was struggling to ignore. She glanced at a wall clock at the movie theater and caught a glimpse of the time – 4:49 pm.<p>Her gaze fell back to the note in her hand.<p>"Yes, miss?" the cashier asked impatiently. "How many tickets?"<p>{Oh, what the heck!} Out of impulse she made her decision. "Sorry, I'm not buying." She smiled apologetically at the cashier and intently strode towards Yuka and Sayuri waiting by the popcorn stand.<p>"Let's go!" Sayuri chirped happily as Akane reached them. She turned to walk towards the cinema doors.<p>"Wait, guys!" Akane exclaimed stopping Yuka and Sayuri in their tracks. "I'm sorry." Akane shook her head, her mind racing to come up with a plausible excuse. "I—I... umm... forgot I have to run a few errands for Kasumi," she lied.<p>"Awww... Akane, that sucks!" Yuka wrinkled her nose in disgust.<p>"I know," Akane whined, rolling her eyes. "But I promised."<p>"No problem, Akane. Good luck with your errands"<p>"See you tomorrow!" Sayuri called out as she and Yuka started walking towards the cinema entrance.<p>"Thanks! Enjoy the movie. Bye!" Akane waved at her friends and quickly left.<p>Twenty minutes later, panting, Akane stopped a few feet away from the cherry blossom tree near the lake. Beads of sweat trickled down her face as she tried to catch her breath.<p>She looked around. The lake magnificently reflected the red and orange hues of the sky and was spotted with a few rowboats. The area of the park seemed deserted. She could only hear a faint tinkle of laughter and a jangle of a bell in the distance. The foot of the cherry blossom tree was in shadow. No one was waiting for her. No one.<p>A myriad of emotions washed over her. Relief. Disappointment. Embarrassment. Regret. {I should have stayed and watched the movie. Silly Akane!} She shook her head in amusement at her own naiveté and uncontrollable laughter started bubbling up inside her. {Go home, Akane}, she mentally commanded herself. "Just go home," she murmured to herself on a suffocated giggle. She slowly turned around and started walking away.<p>Suddenly, a movement behind her stopped her in mid-stride. She became aware of a presence behind her, watching her. Amusement was replaced with wariness. Her heart began to race. Her martial arts instinct kicked in. She was ready for anything or so she thought. She whipped around to face her opponent but was caught off guard at what met her gaze.
