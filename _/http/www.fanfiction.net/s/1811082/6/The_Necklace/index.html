Enjoy!</p><p>Again,</p><p>"…" for speech</p><p><i>italics</i> for thoughts and flashbacks</p><b>THE NECKLACE</b><p>by Raven Nyx</p><p><b>Chapter 6</b></p><p>Akane looked at Shiro's profile as he talked animatedly about his training misadventures. He was quite a handsome guy – his hair a rich dark brown, his eyes the color of steel, his body fit from training. Despite his openness about his life, he remained an enigma. He looked young and carefree yet Akane sensed something else. There were moments when his eyes betrayed his youth and revealed a maturity that she often saw in the eyes of those who have seen too many summers. It was as if he had already lived a number of lifetimes. An old soul peered through his eyes.</p><p>That maturity was one of the things that drew her to him. He was mature and youthful at the same time. He was even-tempered, a total opposite from her. He put her at ease. She felt safe and secure and happy with him. <i>Am I falling in love with this guy?</i></p><p>A voice inside her head squeaked a weak denial. <i>No…</i></p><p>He was the perfect guy. <i>But…</i></p><p><i>No. You can't be in love with him because you're in love with…</i></p><p>"Akane?"</p><p>"Huh?" Akane snapped out from her reverie. She was staring straight at Shiro's warm smiling eyes.</p><p>"Akane-chan, I know I'm quite handsome but you need not stare at me that way," Shiro teased. His smile widened into a grin.</p><p>"Uh, the nerve!" Akane feigned a disgusted expression. "You give yourself too much credit, Shiro-kun!" she exclaimed. "There's actually some icing on your cheeks," she said pointing at a make-believe smear. "Tsk tsk… Such a messy eater!"</p><p>Shiro reached for the empty plastic container of the chocolate cake slices they had and dipped his index finger scraping some left-over icing. He made an attempt to dab some on Akane's nose.</p><p>Akane squealed and grabbed both his wrists to prevent him from getting any icing on her. She giggled and struggled against him but he proved to be a worthy opponent. One minute they were seated side by side and in the next she was on her back and he was leaning down on her. Their eyes met. Her giggles subsided. Suddenly everything around them went into slow motion. Silence dropped like a blanket over them. The only sounds that Akane could hear were their heavy breathing and the wild beating of her heart.</p><p>He gazed into her eyes, his mischievous intent forgotten. His eyes were like pools of liquid silver, flickering with a myriad of emotions that she couldn't identify.</p><p>Her pendant suddenly began to glow and grew warm on her skin. The faint blue light illuminated Shiro's features making him look ethereal. He smiled.</p><p>An unexpected wave of longing suddenly filled her.</p><p>"Shiro-kun…"</p><p>Akane was surprised to hear her own voice, to hear the familiarity, the yearning, the ache as she said his name.</p><p>"You've come back to me at last."</p><p>She reached out to touch his face, gently placing her hand on his cheek.</p><p>"Yes," he whispered. He covered her hand with his, turned his head, and lightly kissed her palm. "As I promised." He slowly leaned down to kiss her.</p><p>Akane closed her eyes in anticipation, his breath warming her face.</p><p>He drew nearer and nearer…</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma grew more agitated as he searched Nerima for Akane without any success.<p>He went to the playground where Akane usually hanged out when she was in a melancholy mood. The lot was empty save for a toddler with his big sister at the swings.</p><p>He returned to Ucchan's to check whether Akane had hooked up with her friends, Yuka and Sayuri. Yuka and Sayuri were heartily eating their orders but Akane wasn't with them.</p><p>He went to Nerima's shopping district, searching every stall and store. She wasn't in any of them.</p><p>He passed by Furinkan High. She wasn't there, either.</p><p>He visited Kuno's manor, expecting that Tatewaki Kuno or his twisted sister, Kodachi, might have had Akane kidnapped. No Akane.</p><p>"Where could she be?" he muttered in frustration. He was getting worried. <i>What if something happened to her?</i> He shook his head and quickly banished that thought.</p><p>He had two other places left to check out: the Cat Café and the park. He decided to visit the Cat Café first.</p><p>"Son-in-law, what a pleasant surprise!" Shampoo's great-grandmother, Cologne, greeted him as he entered the restaurant. She was behind the counter, preparing two orders of ramen for delivery. "Granddaughter! Future son-in-law is here," she called out.</p><p>"Aya!" someone exclaimed in the kitchen, followed by quick footsteps.</p><p>Shampoo came running out of the kitchen "Nihao!" She immediately caught Ranma in a tight embrace. "Ranma, come to date Shampoo?" She looked up at him eagerly awaiting his reply. She was oblivious to the curious stares and meaningful grins the Cat Café's customers were giving them.</p><p>Ranma wasn't oblivious. He broke out in cold sweat. He tried to pry Shampoo away from him as he managed to say, "I'm looking for Akane."</p><p>"Akane not here." Shampoo shook her head vehemently as she struggled to hold on to Ranma. "But Shampoo here."</p><p>"Ranma! Unhand her!"</p><p>Ranma with Shampoo in tow turned to face the café's entrance. Mousse stood by the doorway tightly clutching a metal delivery box. His expression was unreadable behind his thick glasses but a red battle aura emanated from his body.</p><p>"Mind own business, Mousse!" Shampoo haughtily intoned.</p><p>"Ranma, let go of my dear Shampoo," Mousse ordered, his voice full of menace.</p><p><i>Uh-oh</i>, Ranma thought. "I'm trying," he groaned as he doubled his efforts to get away from Shampoo's embrace.</p><p>"You're not trying hard enough!"</p><p>Mousse attacked. Before the delivery box even hit the floor, he released an onslaught of weapons hidden in his long sleeves.</p><p>Then all hell broke loose. Customers began ducking under tables and dodging chains tipped with spikes that were flying in all directions. Some customers scrambled out of the Café in terror. Tables where split in two. Platters of food crashed on the floor.</p><p>Ranma took advantage of the chaos to slip out of Shampoo's embrace. Shampoo became too preoccupied angrily screaming at Mousse to stop that Ranma managed to slip out of the café unnoticed.</p><p>A bucket of cold water put an end to the pandemonium.</p><p>Frightened customers cautiously crawled out under tables and other hiding places to make a hasty exit from the Cat Café.</p><p>Shampoo, her arms akimbo, glared at the dripping wet and defeated duck with its glasses askew at her feet.</p><p>Cologne stood on the counter with her gnarled staff in hand. "Mousse," she said as she shook her head in disbelief at the mess Mousse had made, "this is coming out of your paycheck."</p><p>"Quack!" Mousse looked up at Shampoo, pleading for forgiveness.</p><p>"Hmph!" Shampoo turned her back on him and strode towards the kitchen.</p><p>He bowed his head and quietly uttered a regretful quack.</p><p>"Mousse clean mess," Shampoo said in a clipped tone before the door of the kitchen swung shut.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma did not stop running until he reached the park.<p>He placed his hands on his knees, panting. Sweat dripped from his brow. He looked behind him to check whether Mousse or Shampoo followed him. <i>Phew!</i></p><p>When he had caught his breath, he looked around him in search of Akane. The sun was about to set, bathing the park in a warm orange glow. There were still people around – young and old. Two teenage girls and a boy were seated on a park bench eating ice cream and talking animatedly with each other. A mother and her little girl were standing at the edge of the lake feeding the ducks with pieces of day-old bread. Two little boys were playing catch. Under the cherry tree, a boy about his age was playfully trying to smear something on a very familiar girl. On a boat, a father with his teenage son was—</p><p>Ranma quickly returned his gaze on the couple near the cherry tree. An uneasy feeling was gnawing at his insides. A ball rolled at his feet and he reflexively picked it up. He barely heard the little boy asking for his ball back. He squinted hard at the short-haired girl as the boy leaned for a kiss.</p><p><i>Akane!</i></p><p>Fury consumed him and in his rage, he threw the ball hard at the boy who was trying to kiss HIS fiancée. He didn't wait to see whether he hit the boy or not. He hastily turned on his heels and stalked out of the park. He couldn't trust himself with Akane and the boy with the rage still burning inside him.</p><p>He was shaking with anger.</p><p><i>Jealousy</i>, his inner voice corrected.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Shiro's lips were almost touching Akane's when suddenly a ball shattered the moment and hit his temple hard.<p>"OW!"</p><p>"Hey!" A young boy's voice broke through the haze that fogged Akane's mind. The hubbub of the world suddenly came rushing in to fill the silence. The stomp of the kid's feet, the flap of ducks' wings at the lake and a distant jingle of bicycle bell brought her back to reality.</p><p>Akane's eyes flew open and she immediately sat up, butting Shiro's forehead.</p><p>"Ow!"</p><p>"Oh, I'm so sorry!" Akane exclaimed apologetically, rubbing her fingers on the sore spot on her own forehead. She felt disoriented. She wasn't sure where she was and what time it was. She could only remember one minute she was playfully struggling with Shiro and the next he had cried out in pain.</p><p>The boy ran forward and hastily gave his explanation in one breath. "It wasn't my fault, mister. My friend, Kiro, and I were just playing catch when our ball rolled at a boy's feet. He was wearing a white shirt. He threw the ball at you, sir. Honest!" The little boy fearfully stared up at Shiro. His eyes were glazed with unshed tears.</p><p>"It's ok, kid. I believe you."</p><p>Despite the throbbing ache he felt on his temple and forehead, Shiro gave the boy a reassuring smile and quickly threw the ball back to the kid.</p><p>The boy deftly caught the ball. "Thank you, mister!" He gave a quick bow before he left.</p><p>"Oh man!" His index finger was still sticky with icing. Leaning over Akane, he reached for the pack of table napkins in the picnic basket.</p><p>Akane became overwhelmed by his sudden nearness so she quickly distanced herself from Shiro. Her face burned from embarrassment which she tried to hide by turning her back on him and pretending to rummage through the empty picnic basket beside her.</p><p>"What are you looking for?" Shiro asked with a smile. Her sudden preoccupation with the obviously empty basket amused him.</p><p>"Table napkins," she answered, her voice trembled slightly as she tried to act nonchalantly, as if nothing happened.</p><p>"It's with me, Akane."</p><p>"Oh." She stopped her futile rummaging. Her face burned crimson. <i>You're acting foolishly, Akane</i>, she silently scolded herself.<i> Get a grip!</i></p><p>"Akane, are you all right?" Shiro put a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>The warmth of his hand made her shiver.</p><p>"I—I'm fine," she managed to utter with mock cheerfulness. As an after thought, she added, "I better go." She refused to look at him lest he see her face flushed.</p><p>"Did I do anything wrong, Akane?" Shiro took hold of her hand.</p><p>"No!" Akane hastily exclaimed, pulling her hand away from his. "No," she said more calmly. "Umm… it's just that… Kasumi's… umm… expecting me to be home… before dark," she stammered. She stood up and hastily scooped up her bag.</p><p>"Wait!" Shiro took hold of her hand again, undeterred by her withdrawal just awhile ago. "I want to give you something before you leave."</p><p>He tugged her to face him. In his hand, he held a beautiful red carnation. "This is for you." He handed it to her.</p><p>Her embarrassment drained away and was replaced by sheer delight at his thoughtfulness. "Thank you." The carnation was exquisite. "It's beautiful."</p><p>Shiro smiled and gave her hand a squeeze. "You're welcome."</p><p>"You know, this was my mother's favorite… when she was still alive," she said quietly as she clasped the blossom near her heart. A faint blush colored her cheeks.</p><p>She looked deeply into his silver gray eyes and said, "Thank you, Shiro." Then, she squeezed his hand back. "Well, I have to go now. Bye!"</p><p>"I'll see you soon, Akane." He gave Akane's hand a final squeeze before he let go. <i>I'll see you soon, my Chiyo... sooner than you think</i>.He smiled as he watched Akane leave the park. He couldn't contain the excitement that he was feeling.</p><p><i>Shiro-kun… you've come back to me at last…</i></p><p>The memory of her words sent a shiver of excitement down his spine. She was already starting to remember. Their connection was getting stronger, harder to resist. <i>The time draws near, Chiyo. You need not fight it any longer.</i></p><p>The memory of their interrupted moment though turned his smile into a dark scowl. <i>Damn!</i>, he cursed the boy in white. <i>She should have been mine now, NOW, had the boy not interfered. But no matter,</i> he calmly reminded himself,<i> Chiyo's return to me is inevitable. No one can stand in the way of our love … no one.</i></p><p>His smile returned.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane did not go straight home. She had a lot of things on her mind about yesterday's and today's events. She had to sort it out. The perfect place to do that was at the playground.<p>The sun had just set. The empty playground was in shadow save for lamps that had just flickered to life.</p><p>Akane slumped on one of the empty swings and placed her bag on the swing at her right. She held the carnation to her nose, inhaled its fragrance and sighed.</p><p>She absent-mindedly began to swing herself back and forth as she went through her thoughts. Memories of her past two days with Shiro went through her mind.</p><p><i>The note and carnation at my room.</i> She had found a red carnation like what she was holding now at her desk with a folded note tucked underneath. The note had read:</p><p>Akane,</p><p>Meet me at the park under the cherry blossom tree near the lake at 5:00 pm. I'll be waiting.</p><p>S.S.</p><p>She remembered how she figured it was a challenge letter. She smiled. The note was far from being a challenge letter.</p><p><i>My first meeting with Shiro.</i> Curiosity had driven her to meet the unknown challenger. When she arrived at the park at 5:00 pm, her body was ready for a fight but she was disarmed by soft smiling silver gray eyes, a warm smile showing off pearly white teeth and a handsomely chiseled face crowned with short dark brown hair. Shiro. She remembered his warm hand on her cheek as he wiped off the drop of soda on her chin.</p><p><i>The picnic with him today.</i> The memory of the kiss they almost shared made her blush.</p><p>In just a span of two days, Shiro had turned her world upside down. <i>I ought to be used to that feeling already</i>, she thought amusedly. <i>After I met Ranma and his father, nothing seemed normal anymore.</i></p><p><i>Ranma.</i></p><p>Memories of their recent spat filled her with melancholy.</p><p><i>Don't get me wrong! It's not like a date or nothing like that</i>, Ranma had said.</p><p><i>Like I'd go out with you!</i>, she had retorted.</p><p><i>Uncute tomboy!</i></p><p><i>Fine, fine</i>, she had bit out. <i>Go ask your cute fiancées to the movie then!</i></p><p><i>Maybe, I will!</i> <i>See if I'd bother asking you again.</i></p><p><i>I don't care</i>, she had bit out. <i>I'm not wasting my time glaring at you, Ranma. I'm going to Sayuri's for an enjoyable Friday afternoon.</i></p><p><i>Fine!</i>, he had snapped.</p><p>She frowned. <i>Why does he have to be so insensitive sometimes… often? Why couldn't he be more like Shiro – sensitive, thoughtful, sweet…?</i></p><p>She thoughtfully twirled the stem of the carnation in her fingers. <i>Shiro was perfect yet…</i> Her hesitation baffled and frustrated her. She did not have any reason to hesitate. <i>Except…</i>She had a valid reason but she could not put her finger on it. Her reason seemed to be lost in a haze.</p><p>She sighed. She didn't know what to feel or think anymore. She looked up at the night sky. The moon had already begun its ascent. Its glow was partially hidden by looming rain clouds. She looked at the few visible stars that had twinkled through the cloudy sky wishing for an answer. The only answer she got was a cool breeze that bode of rain.</p><p>She sighed again. Her visit to the park did not do any good. She just felt more confused, lost.</p><p><i>I better get going or father will worry, </i>she thought wearily. She stood up, took her bag from the swing beside her and walked out of the playground.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma had come home fuming. He had gone straight to the dojo to let off some steam. However, after his rigorous workout, he wasn't feeling any calmer. The memory of the dark-haired boy leaning down to kiss Akane burned in his mind. He still couldn't believe what he saw.<p>He was lying with his hands behind his head on the Tendou residence's rooftop looking up at the cloudy night sky. The roof was still warm from the afternoon sun. The warmth would normally bring him comfort but not tonight.</p><p><i>It must be all a lie</i>, Ranma tried to convince himself. <i>A lie.</i> <i>Maybe it wasn't Akane. Maybe he saw some girl that looked like her.</i></p><p><i>Who are you kidding?</i> A voice inside his head said.</p><p>A new wave of anger went through his body. He closed his eyes trying to block out the hateful scene but he couldn't. The scene played on and on in his mind, taunting him.</p><p>"Ranma," Kasumi called out to him. "Dinner's ready."</p><p>He ignored her call. Surprisingly, he did not feel hungry.</p><p>He resolved to confront Akane and ask her what was going on, to ask her why.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane arrived at the Tendou Dojo. <i>Just in time for dinner</i>, she thought. Despite the unresolved issue she had been thinking about at the playground, Akane couldn't contain the giddiness she felt from her afternoon with Shiro. She had to admit that it was her first "normal" date. She blushed. <i>A date</i>, she thought amusedly. She twirled the carnation around her fingers. <i>I better keep this hidden</i>, she decided and carefully placed the carnation inside her bag. When she was about to click her school bag shut, a voice made her stop cold.<p>"How was your little date, Akane?" The icy voice sent shivers down her spine.</p><p><i>I know that voice</i>. She looked around to see who spoke to her. No one was there. A sudden movement on the wall caught her attention. She stared up in surprise.</p><p><i>Ranma.</i></p>
