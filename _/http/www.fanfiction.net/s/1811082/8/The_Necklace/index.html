The gentle pitter-patter of the rain on the roof failed to lull her to sleep. She could distinctly hear the tick tock of her clock and the eerie creek of the house as it was cooled by the rain and night air. The sleep that she most desperately desired eluded her.</p><p>Scenes from the day's events were plaguing her. The gentleness of Shiro's expression. The burning fury in Ranma's. The date. The shouting match. His smile. His sneer. It kept playing on and on in her head.</p><p>She groaned, roughly turned on her side and tightly shut her eyes. She tried to let her mind go blank but to no avail.</p><p>/chink/</p><p>She turned to a prone position and glared up at the ceiling, silently cursing her inability to drift off to sleep.</p><p>/chink/</p><p>She turned again to lie on her belly, an attempt to find a comfortable position.</p><p>/chink/</p><p>"Arrggh!" she growled in frustration. She sat up, furiously yanking the blanket that had become a tangled mess around her body.</p><p>/chink/</p><p>Suddenly, she took notice of the sound. It seemed out of place.</p><p>/chink/</p><p>It was coming from somewhere in her room. She looked around, her eyes already accustomed to the darkness. There was nothing.</p><p>/chink/</p><p>It was coming from her window, she realized. She quickly stood up and walked towards the window to investigate. <i>It's probably just a branch tapping against the window</i>, she rationalized.</p><p>When she looked out the window, there wasn't any tree branch near enough to tap against the glass. She stared at the window, puzzled. She was sure the sound was coming from there.</p><p>Suddenly, a pebble hit the glass. A gasp escaped her lips as she stepped back in surprise. She quickly scanned the grounds of the dojo to see the culprit. Suddenly, a flash of lightning illuminated the grounds and there below a tree she saw Shiro's smiling face. Looking up at her, he waved and then agilely leapt from the ground to the tree branch nearest her window.</p><p>Akane stood momentarily frozen, too stunned to react. All she could do was stare as he balanced along the tree branch. <i>What is he doing here? </i>was the first thought that crossed her mind.</p><p>"Akane-chan, please open the window," Shiro said as he gestured for her to open the window. As Shiro stepped forward, the branch suddenly gave a resounding crack as it broke. This snapped Akane out of her reverie. She quickly unlocked the window and slid it open just in time to permit Shiro entry as he leapt from the falling branch to the open window.</p><p>"What the heck are you doing here?" Akane said incredulously as he stepped off her desk, dripping wet.</p><p>"I – wanted – to," he haltingly said as he tried to catch his breath with his head bowed and his hands upon his knees, "—see – you." He looked up, giving her a sheepish grin.</p><p>Akane just stared, gaping at Shiro. <i>Did I hear him right?</i></p><p>"Excuse me?"</p><p>"I—I wanted to see you," he repeated. He stared into her brown eyes, his expression serious.</p><p>Akane looked back at him in disbelief. She couldn't grasp what he was saying, what was happening. <i>What the heck is he talking about?</i></p><p>Suddenly, she realized that Shiro was dripping wet, a puddle already forming at his feet. "I better get you some towels. You must be cold." She turned away from him and was about to walk towards her armoire when he captured her in a tight embrace, his drenched body cold against her back. She gasped in surprise. She instinctively struggled to break free. He was too strong for her, her efforts did nothing to loosen his grip. The wetness of his clothes slowly seeped into hers.</p><p>"Let me go," she demanded but her voice cracked from fear. "Let me go, Shiro, or else I'll scream," she threatened.</p><p>"I won't. I'll never lose you again, Chiyo," he whispered in her hair as his hand moved towards her collarbone where the blue teardrop pendant rested. When his hand found it, he caressed it between his fingers. "I know I've made you wait too long. But I'm here now. I've come to fulfill my promise."</p><p>The pendant began to glow and rapidly grew in intensity. As Akane opened her mouth to scream, she, Shiro and her room was engulfed in a blinding light.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Despite his resolve to apologize, Ranma couldn't seem to get himself to take the first step out of the guest room towards Akane's. His pride still got in the way and he wasn't so sure that late at night would be an appropriate time. He painfully remembered the beating he got when Akane caught him in her room as he tried to get Ryoga a.k.a. P-chan away from her. But he thought that tonight's purpose was… noble. And he wasn't planning to sneak into her room but politely knock on her door and await her bid to enter.<p>Suddenly, he felt a chill run down his spine. He quickly sat up and looked at the door. There was a strange presence in the house. He could sense it. A feeling of danger and dread gripped his heart.</p><p>"Akane!" He gasped. He quickly slid the guestroom door open and ran to Akane's room.</p><p>White blinding light slipped through the space between the door and the door frame. Ranma quickly grabbed the door knob and tried to open it. The door gave a creak but it did not budge. It was locked. Ranma let out an expletive.</p><p>The light grew more intense. Ranma forcefully rammed his shoulder against the door. It gave a sharp crack and gave way. But all he could see inside was blinding whiteness.</p><p>"Akane!" he screamed.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>He held on to her, not wanting to open his eyes for fear of losing her again. He had waited for so long that having her in his arms felt painfully surreal. But she was there. He could feel the warmth of her skin. He could hear the beating of her heart.<p>"Sh-Shiro-kun?"</p><p>Her dulcet voice. His name.</p><p>"Shiro-kun?"</p><p>He felt her gently caress his cheek, silently willing him to look at her. He slowly opened his eyes. His gaze fell upon her beautiful face, gazing worriedly at him.</p><p>She was breathtaking and at last, she was his forever.</p><p>"Yes, Chiyo-chan?" He gently turned her to face him and smiled warmly at her.</p><p>"You were holding me too tightly, Shiro-kun." Her face broke into a wide smile. "You need not have any fear of losing me."</p><p>He felt his heart clench. Her words so close to the truth. He had lost her but was given a chance to find her again. The search for her, however, took decades, decades of despair and loneliness. He looked up, blinking to hold back tears.</p><p>"I'll never lose you," he uttered, his voice raw with emotion.</p><p>"Of course not, silly!" she said giggling as she gave him a playful slap on the shoulder.</p><p>He easily captured her hand and planted a kiss on her palm. She gazed at him in surprise. She blushed at the passion she saw in his eyes and quickly lowered her gaze at his chest.</p><p>Rich laughter filled the air. It had been a long time since he allowed himself to laugh. It felt liberating.</p><p>"You're laughing at me!" She pouted and playfully poked him in the chest.</p><p>"I am not!" He grinned sheepishly.</p><p>She was trying her best to look sternly at him but the laughter in his eyes proved irresistible. Her face broke into a brilliant smile and laughter flowed from her like the tinkling of chimes.</p><p>He couldn't resist. He gently caressed her flushed cheek, her skin silken to the touch.</p><p>She stopped laughing and beamed up at him.</p><p>He dared to graze her lower lip, pink and inviting, with his thumb. The invitation was too strong that he slowly lowered his lips to hers.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma landed face first on the ground. He felt disoriented. He pushed himself up surprised to feel grass in between his fingers.<p>He looked around, black and white spots danced in his vision. He shook his head to clear it and slowly opened his eyes to look again. He found himself standing in a garden lined with cherry trees full of blosoms. <i>Where the heck am I?</i> he thought.</p><p>He wasn't in Akane's room. He looked behind him to check if he'd see the door he came through. There was no door, only more rows of cherry trees that seemed endless. <i>What the?</i></p><p>A sudden bark of laughter caught his attention. He quickly snuck towards the direction of the sound. He cautiously peeked behind a cherry tree and saw two people locked in an embrace, faces hidden in shadow. He was sure that it was a man and a woman - the man wearing a blue gi and a white hakama, the woman in a cream kimono intricately embroidered with cherry blossoms at the hem.</p><p><i>Could that be Akane? </i>he thought wildly. <i>Can't be! She wouldn't allow no man to touch her like that without clobbering him!</i>, he silently rationalized.</p><p><i>If she's not Akane, then where the heck is she?</i> he thought in panic as he looked around for any sign of Akane. He had to be sure about the girl's identity. He had to get closer. He stealthily ran to a cherry tree nearer the pair.</p><p>He caught the glimpse of short blue-black hair and sparkling brown eyes, and heard her all too familiar laughter. <i>Akane! </i>he thought incredulously.</p><p>To his growing dismay, the young man, the same boy he saw Akane with that afternoon, caressed Akane's cheek with familiarity and intimately grazed her lips with his thumb. <i>And that son of a— </i>Ranma's temper exploded as the boy leaned down to claim her lips. <i>That does it! </i>He leapt out of his hiding place.</p><p>"GET YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF HER!"</p><p>He was seeing red again. The same boiling rage he had felt when Mikado Sanzenin of the Golden Pair had stolen a kiss from him.</p><p>Akane and the boy looked at him in surprise.</p><p>The boy's expression darkened into a scowl and he possessively tightened his hold on Akane's waist.</p><p>Akane stared at Ranma in confusion.</p><p>"AKANE! Why ain't you clobbering this punk?" Ranma demanded.</p><p>Akane looked even more perplexed. She looked up at Shiro. "Akane?" she whispered. A seemingly long silence ensued, broken by the flutter of cherry blossoms brought by a cool breeze.</p><p>Although she said it at barely a whisper, it sounded loud and clear to Ranma. Almost too loud. His heart gave a painful lurch. "A-Akane," he whispered her name as if in prayer as he took a step forward. "Akane." He took another step.</p><p>Akane stared at him blankly.</p><p>Chills went up and down Ranma's spine. <i>She doesn't remember!</i> <i>It's happening all over again! </i>Memories of Akane temporarily forgetting about Ranma because of Shampoo's shiatsu technique came flooding back.</p><p>"Akane, it's me, Ranma," he quietly said as he took another step forward.</p><p>"I'm sorry, sir," Akane said, shaking her head. "You must have me confused with someone else."</p><p>"It's me," Ranma said as he gave himself a mock punch on the cheek, "the pervert, the jerk."</p><p>"I…" Akane said in hesitation at his certainty that she knew him.</p><p>"ENOUGH!" the boy bellowed as he saw Akane's confusion.</p><p>"What have you done to her!" Ranma glared at Shiro accusingly.</p><p>"I made her remember me," Shiro leered at him in triumph. "She's mine now. I'm going to take her away from here." He made a move to leave, arms around Akane's waist.</p><p>"She's not going anywhere with you," Ranma growled.</p><p>"Is that a challenge?" Shiro gave him an amused smile. Without even hearing the reply, he started moving away from Akane with his hands poised over his katana ready to draw it from its sheath.</p><p>Ranma took a fighting stance.</p><p>Akane stepped forward, touching Shiro's shoulder. "Shiro-kun, please don't," she said softly. "Let's just leave."</p><p>"I have to do this, Chiyo-chan," Shiro explained, "or we won't find peace." He gave Akane's hand a squeeze and looked smugly at Ranma, "I keep what is mine."</p><p>Akane looked between them worriedly but slowly nodded with understanding and stepped back under the shade of a cherry tree.</p><p>Ranma scowled. "We'll see about that," he muttered. "She was never yours to begin with… AKANE'S MY FIANCEE!"</p><p>Ranma took the offensive and launched his attack. He quickly closed the gap between them and threw a powerful double punch and kick.</p><p>Shiro adeptly evaded his attack.</p><p>Ranma kicked up the pace a notch and resorted to his Chestnuts Over a Roasting Fire technique.</p><p>He again effectively eluded every punch.</p><p><i>He's quick! </i>Ranma thought in alarm. He leapt away to formulate another attack.</p><p>"Is that all you've got?" Shiro sneered at Ranma. "I guess it's my turn."</p><p>Ranma looked in surprise as Shiro seemingly vanished into thin air. He quickly concentrated on the sounds around him, making himself keener to his surroundings. At the last second, he heard the silent swish of the blade slicing through the air and agilely sidestepped, avoiding Shiro's blade by a few centimeters.</p><p>Shiro sneered at him. "I'm impressed. But I won't miss next time." Again, he disappeared.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Chiyo looked on as the two men fought. Her heart was pounding as she watched them go head to head in battle. Both appeared equal in skill and speed.<p>Her mind was also racing as she tried to remember who the pigtailed boy was. <i>Ranma</i>. <i>That was his name. Akane. That's what he called me. </i></p><p>She couldn't remember him. When she thought more about it, she couldn't remember anything else except for Shiro-kun and this strong feeling that she has for him. But other than that, she was drawing a blank.</p><p>Panic surged into her as she realized that she had no memory about herself or anyone else other than Shiro. <i>Who am I?</i> <i>I don't know who I am!</i> She looked around in panic, trying to draw answers from things around her. <i>I don't know where I am!</i></p><p>"Shiro," she moaned. Her vision was blurred with tears. Her whole body began to tremble. "Shiro."</p><p>She fell to her knees as she struggled with the blankness. It was as if she never existed before this moment.</p><p>"Shiro." She hugged herself tightly, rocking back and forth. She stared again at the two figures fighting in the distance, finding comfort in their familiarity.</p><p>The pigtailed boy barely missed Shiro's blade from skewering him, his white tank top torn at various places and stained scarlet with blood. He fell against the trunk of a cherry tree tired but still he managed to glare defiantly at Shiro. He barely evaded another slash that cut the wood deeply.</p><p>A new consciousness entered heavily into her mind, pushing, struggling to take over the emptiness. She suddenly felt like her head was splitting open. She shut her eyes tightly and bit her lip to stop herself from screaming.</p><p>The face of the pigtailed boy flashed in her mind with a name she suddenly recognized.</p><p><i>Ranma!</i></p><p>With that single name, a flood of memories came rushing in. A pigtailed girl with a panda showing up in the living room. A pigtailed boy stepping out of a furo. A fight with a fanged boy at a school field. A boy on top a tree mewing like a cat. A boy in ice skates barely able to stand up. So many more memories flowed into her that she could barely make sense of them. But the deluge was a most welcomed feeling.</p><p><i>Akane is MY fiancée. You touch her and I'll kill you.</i></p><p>These words resounded in her mind. "Akane," she whispered. Her eyes suddenly flew open as if awakening from a nightmare. "I'm Akane," she gasped.</p><p>The blue pendant she was wearing burst into bright white light that swallowed everything.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The light slowly faded.<p>Shiro found himself back in Akane's room. He squeezed his eyes shut to clear the white spots muddling his vision.</p><p>He looked around and saw his Chiyo-chan kneeling on the bed, cheeks stained with tears. His attention was riveted by the once blue pendant that had turned into a dull black.</p><p>Ranma took advantage of Shiro's distraction to disarm him with a swift kick to the wrist. The katana flew from his grip and skidded underneath Akane's bed.</p><p>Shiro did not seem to notice. "Chiyo-chan?" He just kept staring at the girl on the bed. "Chiyo?"</p><p>The girl stared back at him and subtly shook her head. Chiyo was no longer peering at him from those clear brown eyes.</p><p>A crazed look came over Shiro's expression distorting his handsome face. "NOOOOOOO!"</p><p>He quickly grabbed a dagger hidden in his gi and rushed towards Akane. "Give her back! Give her back to me!" he cried.</p><p>"NO!" Ranma quickly leapt into action, launching himself on Shiro and pinning him down on the floor. He struggled fiercely but Ranma was able to hold him down and rid him of the dagger.</p><p>"Chiyo… Chiyo…," he moaned. "I can't lose you, Chiyo. I can't! I just can't!" he sobbed.</p><p>"Akane?" Ranma looked at the familiar girl on the bed.</p><p>"Yes, Ranma," Akane replied with a nod. "It's me."</p><p><i>She remembers me. </i>Ranma sighed in relief. <i>She's back.</i></p><p>Akane started to step off the bed when the clasp of her necklace broke.</p><p>The pendant fell to the floor, shattering like glass.</p><p>"It's broken," Akane muttered to herself as she stared at the shattered pieces. As she reached down to start picking them up, wisps of smoke lifted up from the broken pieces. She sat back on her bed in surprise.</p><p>The smoke gathered together, swirled and materialized into a translucent figure of a girl in the likeness of Akane. Her long hair was tied back in a ponytail and she was dressed in a traditional wedding kimono.</p><p>Akane and Ranma were transfixed by the figure.</p><p>"It's me," Akane said in awe.</p><p>"It's you," Ranma said at the same time.</p><p>The figure looked around the room until her eyes fell on Shiro, who was lying prostrate on the floor, sobbing, defeated.</p><p>"Shiro-kun," the figure called out softly.</p><p>"Ch-chiyo?" Shiro stammered as he struggled to look up to see who had spoken.</p><p>"Yes, it's me." The figure nodded and smiled sadly.</p><p>With a sudden surge of strength and speed, Shiro broke free from Ranma's grasp, sending him sliding across the floor.</p><p>"Oh, Chiyo!" He ran to embrace her but went right through her. He stared at her ghost-like figure in disbelief. A single tear rolled down his already tear-stained cheek.</p><p>The figure glided towards him and reached out to touch his face. He only felt coldness rather than the warmth and solidity of fingertips. "I'm sorry, Shiro-kun. I waited and fought to stay alive. For us. For our love. But I couldn't." Luminous tears trickled down her face.</p><p>"When I died, I thought I'd see you on the other side but when I woke from death, I found myself trapped." She looked down on the shattered pieces of the pendant. "Trapped in the pendant until you find me."</p><p>Shiro looked away from her in shame and whimpered, "I'm so sorry, so sorry."</p><p>"No, love," Chiyo shook her head. "You've fulfilled your promise. You've come back to me."</p><p>Chiyo leaned down and held her hand out to Shiro, coaxing him to stand up. Shiro took her hand and as he stood up, he gradually crumbled into dust until only a white translucent semblance of him remained.</p><p>Shiro looked down at Chiyo tenderly. "I love you," he whispered as he leaned down to kiss her.</p><p>"I love you," she whispered back as their lips met in a sweet kiss.</p><p>Slowly, both figures began to fade away into the darkness.</p><p>The couple gave Akane, who was still sitting on the bed, and Ranma, who was picking himself up from the floor, a grateful and almost affectionate smile.</p><p>"Your hearts are in the right place," Chiyo advised before she and Shiro completely disappeared.</p><p>Then, there was darkness. Only the steady pitter-patter of the rain from outside could be heard.</p><p>Akane continued to stare at the spot where Chiyo and Shiro had faded away.</p><p>Ranma winced from the sharp pain he was feeling from cuts and bruises he sustained from the duel as he surveyed his body for more injuries.</p><p>"'Kane, you okay?" Ranma looked at Akane in concern as she remained unmoving.</p><p>Snapped back to reality by his voice, Akane looked up at him and nodded. "I should get the first aid kit so we can tend to your wounds."</p><p>She quickly stood up and took a few unsteady steps towards the door. The strain of the evening suddenly hit her turning her knees to Jell-o. She found herself falling on her knees.</p><p>With lightning speed, Ranma caught her before she hit the floor.</p><p>"Akane, you idiot," Ranma said as he supported and lifted her up with his arms tightly around her waist.</p><p>Akane flushed in embarrassment at her clumsiness and at the insult from Ranma. She was about to glare and snap at him when she found herself staring at gentle blue eyes, peering down at her with a mixture of concern and amusement.</p><p>His mirth was infectious that her frown turned into a smile.</p><p>"There, you look more beautiful when you smile."</p><p>"Ranma, you are an idiot." Her smile turned into laughter.</p><p>"What!" Ranma exclaimed, his eyes twinkling with delight.</p><p>Suddenly, the lights came on. Soun whose eyes already started flooding with tears stood frozen by the light switch staring at his daughter and future son-in-law. Just a few steps behind him by the doorway were Genma in panda form, Kasumi, Nabiki and Happosai agape and staring at the unusual scene.</p><p>"Oh my!" Kasumi exclaimed with both her hands on her cheeks pink with embarrassment.</p><p>Ranma and Akane instinctively jumped apart.</p><p>"W—wait! It—it's not what you think!" Ranma sputtered defensively as a blush slowly crept up his cheeks.</p><p>Genma proudly held up a signboard that said, "That's my boy!"</p><p>"We better leave the two lovebirds alone, daddy," Nabiki said as she gave Akane and Ranma a wink and a smirk.</p><p>"Nabiki!" Kasumi scolded her sister. "They're too young. They shouldn't be doing these things yet, not until they're married."</p><p>"We're not doing anything!" Akane exclaimed. Her face burned with embarrassment.</p><p>"How could you! How could you, Akane-chan!" Happosai sniffed. "I'll forgive you if you let me weep on your bosoms." He launched himself towards Akane.</p><p>"Oh no, you won't!" Ranma effectively stopped Happosai with a kick that sent him flying through the window.</p><p>Panting heavily, Ranma tried to explain again. "It's not what you think."</p><p>"Now, now, son, it's okay," Soun sniffled and gently patted Ranma's shoulder. "We understand, don't we, Saotome-kun?"</p><p>"Urhu, urhu." The panda nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>"You do, dad? Akane looked up at him stunned. Ranma turned to Akane with a perplexed look.</p><p>"Yes, we understand perfectly," Soun said firmly. "We'll have to plan the wedding sooner. Right, Saotome-kun?"</p><p>The panda quickly lifted up another signboard that said, "You're absolutely right, Tendo-kun!"</p><p>"Dad!"</p><p>"Pop!"</p><p>Akane and Ranma groaned in unison.</p><p style="text-align:center;">- The End -</p><p>Until my next fanfiction!
