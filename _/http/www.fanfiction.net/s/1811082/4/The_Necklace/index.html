</div><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> Most of the characters used in the story are creations of the great Rumiko Takahashi.<p><b>Author's Note:</b> Hello! Sorry for the delay on this chapter. I've been awfully busy. Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy reading it. It's my longest chapter so far. Again, thank you for your reviews. Keep them coming!</p><p>By the way, words in italics are thoughts.<p><b>THE NECKLACE<br/></b><br/>by Raven Nyx<p><b>Chapter 4</b><p>"Dinner's ready," Kasumi called out softly.<p>Okays and yeahs followed by the patter of footsteps resounded throughout the house. Kasumi waited patiently at one end of the table with the rice cooker beside her. The table was laden with hot bowls of miso soup, a platter of pork tonkatsu glazed with a sweet sauce, another platter of steamed fish and a plate of buttered vegetables.<p>Family and guests rushed into the room and eagerly took their seats.<p>"Looks good, Kasumi!" Happosai exclaimed as he greedily eyed the feast on the table.<p>"Why, thank you, grandfather Happosai." Kasumi smiled. She passed steaming bowls of rice to everyone.<p>"Let's eat!"<p>They all started digging in.<p>Soun suddenly stopped, noticing the empty space beside Nabiki. "Where's Akane?" His voice was tinged with panic.<p>"Oh, father, she said she's going out with her friends," Kasumi calmly explained.<p>"Yeah," Ranma said as he stuffed a pork slice in his mouth. "She's with Yuka and Sayuri. I overheard they were going to watch a movie."<p>"But... but... she should be home by now." Soun's eyes glazed with tears. "Oh, my baby!" Tears began streaming down his face.<p>"Oh, please, daddy," Nabiki said, rolling her eyes. "Akane's a big girl. She can handle herself."<p>"She's right, Tendo-kun," Genma agreed and resumed his frenzied eating.<p>"I'm home!" Akane's voice rang from the entrance hall.<p>"See," Nabiki said matter-of-factly to her father who was hastily wiping his tears off with his sleeve.<p>After a few minutes, Akane shuffled into the room already out of her school uniform. "Sorry, I'm late." She quickly took her place beside Nabiki.<p>"So, how was the movie?" Nabiki asked nonchalantly.<p>"Huh? What movie?" Akane's brows furrowed in confusion.<p>"Ranma told us you watched a movie with your friends." Everyone paused, waiting for her answer.<p>"Oh! Right!" Akane giggled nervously. "Umm... the movie...it was great!" Her extra cheerful voice sounded hollow to her ears. The people around the table continued staring at her, expecting her to go on. Awkward silence.<p>"Here, Akane," Kasumi said, handing Akane a bowl of steaming rice. She seemed oblivious to the expectant looks of people around the table and the pregnant silence that hung in the air.<p>"Umm...No thanks, Kasumi. I'm really full," she quickly said, smiling apologetically and handing the bowl back to her sister. "Please excuse me." She stood up and made a hasty retreat.<p>"Oh, my, this is going to grow cold," Kasumi gently exclaimed. "Anyone for seconds?"</p><p>Akane rushed into her room, hastily closed the door and leaned her body against it.<p>"Phew!"<p>She had narrowly escaped their prying eyes and unspoken questions particularly Nabiki's. Gradually the mixture of panic and anxiety she had felt at the table subsided but guilt left a hollow feeling in her stomach. She wasn't exactly honest to her family. But she shook it off with a rebellious streak. <i>They need not know my every action</i>, Akane stubbornly justified. <i>Besides, I have nothing to be guilty about. I just spent a wonderful afternoon with a new friend</i>, she thought, trying to convince herself. <i>Nothing's wrong with that.</i><p>The tension from that afternoon and at dinner was not completely gone. She gently massaged the tight knots of muscles on her shoulders and back, rubbing the stiffness out. <i>I need a workout</i>, she decided and slowly walked to her closet to change.</p><p>"You know," Nabiki said thoughtfully, "I think Akane's hiding something."<p>It was after dinner. The table had been cleared except for three steaming cups of green tea and a teapot. Happosai was out on his nightly prowl. Soun and Genma were, as usual, playing Shogi. Kasumi, Nabiki and Ranma were left in the dining room watching TV and sipping tea.<p>"What makes you say such a thing, Nabiki?" Kasumi asked.<p>"Her hesitation in answering a simple question, her unusually perky voice and her quick retreat to her room. Don't you think it's a bit suspicious?"<p>"Nah!" Ranma quickly dismissed the question, eyes still glued on the TV. "She's just in one of her moods, that's all."<p>"You don't know her like I do, Ranma." Nabiki propped her chin on her hand and eyed Ranma. "I bet she didn't watch a movie with her friends. Instead, she secretly met someone else and has been doing so despite your engagement. Why else would she be so evasive to innocent questions, hmm?"<p>"I bet she is, Nabiki." Ranma smiled smugly at her. "I bet she is!"<p>Kasumi gasped and said, "Oh, my! Akane wouldn't."<p>"More of couldn't," Ranma started. "Akane secretly meeting someone else, my butt! Who'd want to date that uncute, macho chick anyway?"<p>"You forget, Ranma, that she's very popular among the boys at Furinkan High," Nabiki amusedly pointed out.<p>"Puh-lease! She ain't dating none of them. I would know."<p>"Mm-hmm." Nabiki looked at him with a raised brow. "And how can you be so certain?"<p>"'Coz I'm her...," he hesitated and stared down at his fidgeting hands, a blush slowly creeping up his neck and spreading to his cheeks and ears. "I... uh, you know?"<p>"No, we don't know, Ranma," said a very amused Nabiki. She gave Kasumi a wink.<p>"I—I'm um... we're umm...," Ranma continued to stammer. Suddenly, it hit him. "Hey, wait a minute!" Ranma's expression went from wide-eyed surprise to a furious scowl in less than a second.<p>Nabiki looked at him innocently and shrugged.<p>"You and your stupid theories!" Ranma glared at Nabiki and stomped off.<p>"Oh, my!"<p>Nabiki snapped her fingers. "Drats!" She quickly took out a tape recorder from under the table and pressed stop. "Oh, well, I'll get another shot," she drawled.<p>"Nabiki!" Kasumi admonished.</p><p>Ranma briskly strode to the dojo to let off some steam. Nabiki really got on his nerve. <i>Who does she think she is</i>, he simmered. <i>Akane seeing someone else! A cock and bull story if you ask me. An unlikely theory.</i><p>When he reached the door, he saw Akane breaking a stack of cement blocks with a quick downward chop. He paused by the door hidden in shadow and silently watched her.<p>Unaware of Ranma's presence, she piled another set of blocks, carefully arranging them into a neat stack. Once she was finished, she properly positioned herself, took a few deep breaths, and without warning let out a loud cry as her hand smashed the bricks with ease. A strand of blue-black hair strayed to her face. She tried to blow it away while she dusted her hands but the strand stubbornly clung to her cheek, wet with perspiration. Reluctantly she brushed it away with dusty fingers that left a smudge on her cheek.<p>"You've got dirt on your cheek." Ranma casually stepped into the dojo and amusedly smiled at Akane.<p>"Oh!" Akane exclaimed. "Ranma, you startled me."<p>"It's over here." He gestured, pointing at his own cheek.<p>"Oh, it's ok. I'm done and on my way to a warm and relaxing bath anyway." Akane brushed past him, wiping the sweat from her brow with her sleeve. "The floor is yours."<p><i>She's kinda cute</i>, he mused as he watched her saunter out of the room. <i>Oh, what was I thinking! Her? Cute?</i> An unwelcome image of her laughing with someone else came to mind. The guy with her held her hand. A tight knot of anxiety formed in his stomach. Another overwhelming emotion he couldn't quite name gnawed at his insides and made him clench his fists in fury. <i>Impossible!</i> He blotted out the unthinkable image with a shake of his head and began his routine of punches and kicks.</p><p>Akane was relaxing in a tub of warm water. It was so refreshing. She placed a warm hand towel on her head and sighed. The flesh of her fingers and toes were already becoming wrinkled from the long soak.<p>Her thoughts were still with Shiro and their afternoon. She was strangely drawn to him. <i>We've only met and yet I feel like I've known him all my life. Why?</i> She couldn't understand it.<p>Her hand strayed to the pendant of her necklace. Should she see him again tomorrow? She felt a pang of guilt. She didn't know what to do. She stared off into space, her mind struggling to come up with answers.<p>At first, there was a faint rap at the door. "Akane?" A voice called out, muffled by the wooden door.<p>"Akane?" The doorknob rattled as someone attempted to open the door. It was locked. Akane had unwittingly locked it when she went in.<p>"Akane?" The voice was louder, alarmed and was now accompanied by a series of loud bangs that made the door shudder in its frame.<p>"Akane!" The door flew open and Ranma came running into the laundry room and quickly slid the door to the bathroom open. "A—ka—ne..."<p>Ranma stopped in his tracks. Akane was staring at him from the tub. She was jerked from her reverie by the crack and crash of the door. For a moment, they stared at each other, unblinking.<p>Akane was the first to recover. "Aaaahhh! Get out!" Akane screamed. "Ranma, you, you pervert!"<p>"Let me explain." Ranma ducked as a rubber duck, a bar of soap and a wooden basin came wheezing by, missing his ear by a centimeter. However, a mallet successfully smacked him on the face.<p>"Out!"<p>Ranma scrambled out the door as more objects flew past him and quickly slammed it shut.<p>Akane was breathing hard. One hand tightly clutched a towel around her and the other was poised to throw the bathroom sink. The blue pendant shimmered on her moist skin as if inflamed by her fury.<p>Leaning against the door and nursing his stinging face, Ranma tried to catch his breath. <i>I wasn't going to peek or nothing!</i><p>"What happened?" Soun demanded. He, Genma, Kasumi and Nabiki had dashed to the bathroom when they heard Akane's piercing scream. All eyes were on Ranma.<p>"She's been in there forever. She wasn't answering. I thought she was in trouble," he explained in one breath.<p>"Son, I know you're engaged," Soun began in a low voice, casually draping an arm around Ranma's shoulders. The draped arm slowly tightened around him in a choking grip. Failing to free himself from his future father-in-law 's death grip, Ranma started making strangled sounds. "But you shouldn't be taking such liberties. Not until you're married."<p>Genma patted Soun's shoulder. "Now, now, Tendo-kun. The boy's just showing some interest. Isn't that a good thing?"<p>Soun loosened his hold on Ranma, who sank to floor in fits of coughing. "You're absolutely right, Saotome-kun!" Tears welled up in his eyes.<p>"Ranma, you sly dog!" Nabiki teased and then, she casually sauntered off.<p>"It ain't like that!" Ranma managed to croak.<p>"Son, you don't need to explain," Genma dismissed with a wave of his hand.<p>"Saotome-kun, the future's brightening for the dojo!" Soun cried with joy. "Let's drink to celebrate. Kasumi, bring out some sake." Arm in arm, Soun and Genma pranced to the dining room.<p>"You shouldn't be encouraging them, father. They're still too young." Frowning in disapproval, Kasumi followed them.<p>Ranma groaned.<p>Akane came out of the bathroom in her pajamas.<p>"I didn't mean to—I was just—" Ranma tried to explain.<p>She just walked past him with her head bowed, her expression hidden in shadow.<p>Taken aback by her reaction – more of the lack of an explosive one –, he helplessly watched as she disappeared at the end of the hall that led to the staircase.</p><p>It was lunch break at Furinkan High. The 1-F classroom was a hotbed of activity. Most were eating and talking with friends. Some were catching some sleep, snoring away at their desks. Others were in a frenzy copying homework due in the next class.<p>Ranma sat with his friends, Daisuke and Hiroshi.<p>"Man, I envy you!" Hiroshi exclaimed, eyeing the bento box and the heart-shaped okonomiyaki on Ranma's desk.<p>"How can you be so lucky!" Daisuke added. "You better share."<p>"Knock yourselves out," Ranma offered, chuckling. He stole a quick glance at Akane.<p>Akane with her head on her hand was sitting alone at her desk, staring out the window at a gloomy sky that seemed to match her mood. Her bento box set in front of her remained untouched.<p>Ranma had been worried about her since last night. He had sensed a change in her. She seemed more subdued. Ranma expected a verbal and physical beating from her that morning but nothing happened, not a peep or mallet in sight. She had quietly entered the dining room for breakfast and took her seat. Despite her father and sisters' remarks and his vehement denials about last night, she silently ate her meal. On the way to school, he had tried striking up a conversation but he failed to draw any reaction except for occasional nods or mumbled answers. She seemed so distant. <i>Akane must be really, really mad at me</i>, Ranma thought guiltily as he stole another glance at Akane.<p>Daisuke's voice jerked him from his thoughts. "Ranma?"<p>"Yeah, yeah," Ranma said distractedly.<p>"Ok, we'll get you a drink then"<p>"What?" Ranma's brow furrowed.<p>"We asked you if you wanted a drink and you said yes," Hiroshi said matter-of-factly. His palm faced up was thrust at Ranma. "And it's not for free, Saotome."<p>"Fine." Ranma grudgingly handed Hiroshi the money and the two boys left.<p>At that moment, Yuka and Sayuri had returned carrying brown paper lunch bags and were about to walk past his desk on their way to Akane. Ranma quickly took the opportunity to fish about what had happened yesterday hoping to unearth some other reason why Akane wasn't acting like herself.<p>"Hey, guys! How was the movie yesterday?"<p>"It was awesome!" Yuka said excitedly. "It has a wicked twist."<p>"You'd never guess the ending," Sayuri said and added in a somber tone, "It's a pity Akane wasn't able to watch it with us. She said she had some errands to runs."<p>"Oh," Ranma said and muttered under his breath, "I knew it!" Maybe he wasn't the reason for Akane's pensive mood after all. He felt immensely relieved for a moment but Nabiki's theory came to mind. <i>She was right about one thing</i>, he thought dejectedly.<p>"What?"<p>"Nothing."<p>"Oh, well... anyway, maybe you could take her out to see it, Ranma," Yuka nonchalantly suggested and secretly flashed a smile at Sayuri.<p>"Yeah, she really wanted to see that movie yesterday," Sayuri added, giving Yuka a surreptitious wink, and after giving quick good-byes, they both left a thoughtful Ranma.<p><i>Errands? What errands were they talking about?</i> Ranma tried recalling last night's dinner conversation. There wasn't any mention of any errands for Akane. Mr. Tendo was even worried about Akane's late arrival. <i>Why would Akane lie about not watching the movie? Was it a school errand? Was she out with—</i><p>Hiroshi and Daisuke's return interrupted Ranma's stream of questions. The two boys were eager to start eating and get a taste of Ukyo's tasty okonomiyaki. Ranma's tummy also rumbled at the mention of lunch. He took a final look at Akane and resolved to casually ask her about her errands yesterday. That would clear things up. With that settled, he started stuffing himself with the meal Kasumi had prepared and okonomiyaki.<p>At her desk, Akane was far from upset about missing the movie that her friends were animatedly talking about or about last night. Well, she was a bit upset about the bathroom incident but she unusually didn't feel like fretting about it. Her mind was bent on more important matters or specifically on one important question, should she see Shiro or shouldn't she? <i>Decide, Akane.</i><p>As if in answer, her blue pendant gleamed.</p><p>Ranma and Akane were on their way home. Akane walked silently. She was resolved on seeing Shiro that afternoon but was still brooding on how to give everyone the slip. Ranma who was treading the fence with ease was also silently thinking of a way to start a conversation with Akane to ask about her missing the movie and her mysterious "errand".<p>"Umm," they both began, breaking the silence.<p>"Yes?" they again said in unison.<p>"You go ahead, Ranma," Akane said a smile touching her lips. "What is it?"<p>"Well, umm... I was wondering if you'd like to watch a movie with me," Ranma said quietly, taking Yuka and Sayuri's suggestion.<p>"What?" Akane looked at him in astonishment. She wasn't sure if she heard him right.<p>"You see, I found out from your friends that you weren't able to watch yesterday because of some errand," he explained. "So... I thought I'd take you to watch it." He peered at Akane's face for her reaction and being unable to read her expression, he quickly added, "Don't get me wrong! It's not like a date or nothing like that."<p>Akane heard him all right. He was asking her to a movie. Odd but touching, she thought and inwardly smiled. But his last rude remark got her riled up, dashing the happiness she had just felt, and so she hastily replied, "Like I'd go out with you!"<p>Ranma was elated that Akane was her old self again, leaving him tongue-tied for an instant. But soon her curt comeback washed over him, and immediately he flung the first insult that crossed his mind. "Uncute tomboy!"<p>"Fine, fine." Akane's voice was laced with sarcasm. "Go ask your cute fiancées to the movie then!"<p>"Maybe, I will!" Ranma retorted furiously. "See if I'd bother asking you again."<p>"I don't care," she bit out.<p>They tensely regarded each other. Ranma stood on the fence, glaring at Akane with his hands on his hips, his jaw taut with anger and his suspicions forgotten. On the street, Akane met his angry gaze with an equally contemptuous look, her arms crossed over her chest. Tension crackled in the air between them.<p>Realizing that the situation offered a chance for escape, Akane broke the silence. She said flatly, "I'm not wasting my time glaring at you, Ranma." Her arms fell back to her sides. "I'm going to Sayuri's for an enjoyable Friday afternoon," she lied, emphasizing the word enjoyable, then she turned and walked away.<p>"Fine!" Ranma snapped as he scowled at her retreating figure and irately added under his breath, "Uncute!" He was furious. He went out of his way to be nice to her and where did that get him? <i>And to think I was so worried about her</i>, he bitterly thought. He didn't understand Akane. When he was being honest, she often got upset. When he didn't do a thing, she'd be equally upset. Just now, when he was trying to do her a favor, she threw it in his face. He didn't get Akane at all. <i>Why does she have to be so difficult?</i> He sighed in frustration.<p>He decided to go home. After the episode with Akane, he didn't feel like watching a movie anymore. He felt like training for an hour or so to release some of that afternoon's tension. Suddenly, his stomach grumbled. He checked his pockets and his bag for spare change to buy a snack with. He only found 150 yen. <i>Aww, man! What could I possibly buy with this much?</i> he thought grumpily.<p>As if in answer to his silent complaint, he heard a familiar voice call out his name. "Ranma honey!"<p>It was Ukyo. She waved at him before putting up her shop curtain that read Ucchan's Okonomiyaki.<p>"Hey, Ucchan!" Ranma greeted as he casually strolled towards her.<p>"Come in!" Ukyo invited and gave her fiancé a brilliant smile. "For you, the meal's on the house." She winked, casually slipped her hand through his arm and led him into her store.</p>
