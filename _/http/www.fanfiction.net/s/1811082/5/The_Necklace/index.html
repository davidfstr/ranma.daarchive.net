</div><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> Most of the characters used in the story are creations of the great Rumiko Takahashi.</p><p><b>Author's Note:</b> Hello! I'm back. It's my sembreak and I took this opportunity to finish and post this chapter. I hope you'll enjoy this one. It'll give you a background on Shiro and Chiyo. I hope it's interesting enough and not too waffy for your taste. Again, thank you so much for your reviews. Keep them coming!</p><p>Again,</p><p>"..." for speech</p><p><i>Italicized words</i> for thoughts</p><b>THE NECKLACE</b><p>by Raven Nyx</p><p><b>Chapter 5</b></p><p>Shiro was patiently waiting for Akane. He was certain she was coming. He knew that she felt it, a connection, an invisible thread of destiny that bound them together. Fate had handed him the opportunity to see and even have his Chiyo... his Akane back again. <i>I promise that we'll soon be together.</i></p><p>He stood with his hands clasped behind his back under the shade of the cherry blossom tree where they had met yesterday. He silently watched rowboats lazily pass by. The sky was overcast making the afternoon cool and breezy and at the same time cold and ominous. A soft breeze gently caressed his face. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, letting the bittersweet memories of long ago come flooding back.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>At the age of sixteen, he had become well trained in the arts and the code of the samurai. Like most of the boys in their village, he was trained to follow the noble line of samurais in his family. He hoped to one day bring honor to his family and to his country like his forebears.</p><p>Training was not limited to boys and men. Daughters of samurais were also taught to wield swords and bows, and to ride. Their training, however, was not for battle but for protection during times when husbands, fathers and brothers were in attendance to the emperor. Mizuki Chiyo was one of those who trained and one of the few who took training to heart. At the age of fourteen, she had become skilled with the sword and even capable of beating boys older than her in spars. But she was best with the bow. Her hands were steady and her aim true.</p><p>At one target practice, Shiro was standing twenty feet from the target, tightly gripping his bow and carefully aiming for the bull's eye. A few paces on his right stood Chiyo holding hers with ease. With the swing of a red flag, they fired. Shiro missed the center by a few inches and he shook his head in disappointment.</p><p>Beside him, Mizuki Taisho, respected daimyo or lord of their village, stepped forward and proudly patted his daughter's shoulder. She had hit the bull's eye. Chiyo looked up at her father and beamed at him. She then turned to her left and caught Shiro looking at her. She gave him a quick nod and a smile.</p><p>Shiro quickly turned away, pretending to be busy checking his bow's string. His cheeks burned. When he slowly took a cautious peek, she and her father had left.</p><p>Chiyo or Chiyo-chan as she was fondly called by the villagers was the only daughter of the daimyo and Mizuki Tomoe. She had three older brothers – all married – and a younger one whom she adored. Despite their privileged status in society, the Mizukis were close to the people. Her father, an honorable samurai, governed the people with passion, wisdom and justice and maintained peace in the village. Her mother, renowned for her beauty, intelligence and compassion, taught reading and writing at the local school.</p><p>Chiyo in her own right was adored by the villagers especially the children. When she was not in training, taking lessons from her mother or babysitting her little brother, she was often at the village square either playing with the young ones or telling them tales of adventure and fantasy. The children enjoyed the games but absolutely loved her stories. They always looked forward to afternoons with her, but they were not the only one.</p><p>Shiro would often wander to the village square when she was there. He'd casually watch her from a distance, fascinated by her skill in weaving tales, and capturing the children's imagination and bringing them to a world of make believe. He envied the young boys who had the courage to give her flowers that made her smile. He hopelessly had a crush on her and although she often acknowledged him with a polite nod or a smile when they met, he always lost his courage to talk to her.</p><p>Finally, God opened a window of opportunity. On his way home one late afternoon, he happened to pass by the village square. Chiyo was it in a game of tag with the kids. To catch a glimpse of her, he stopped by, pretending to tighten the ropes that bound the firewood he was carrying home. A thud and the children's cries jerked him from his task. He saw the kids rush to the injured and quickly he ran to them to help.</p><p>"Oh, don't cry," Chiyo soothed as some of the little ones began to cry. "I'm okay." She brushed the dust from her apple green kimono and tried standing up. "Ow!" Her knees buckled beneath her from the sudden pain that shot up from her left ankle.</p><p>"Excuse me," Shiro said as he made his way to Chiyo. "Are you okay?" His brows knitted with concern and his shyness dissipated.</p><p>"I think I sprained my ankle."</p><p>"Here, let me help you up." He crouched down beside her, took her left arm and brought it around his neck, and firmly wrapped his other arm around her waist. She leaned her weight against him. He slowly stood up and led her to a wooden bench with the kids trailing behind them.</p><p>He helped her take a seat. "Thank you," she smiled at him and turned to the children, dismissing them for the afternoon.</p><p>"Bye, Chiyo-chan!" the kids exclaimed and obediently left for their homes.</p><p>A little girl of around five stayed behind.</p><p>"Yes, Kaoru-chan?" Chiyo asked softly.</p><p>Kaoru timidly approached her. "I hope you'll be okay," she whispered sincerely, looking up at Chiyo with big amber eyes.</p><p>Chiyo smiled. "I will. Don't worry." She patted the top of Kaoru's head. "Now, go on home."</p><p>"Mm." The little girl smiled back, gave a quick nod, and hurriedly left.</p><p>When the girl was gone, Chiyo sighed out loud and gently bent down to check her ankle. She grimaced in pain when she touched it.</p><p>"May I?"</p><p>She nodded and he knelt down and gingerly lifted her foot. He looked at the ankle's swollen state. "Can you move your foot?"</p><p>She slowly moved her foot up and down and winced.</p><p>"Good, it's not broken. It's just a sprain," He concluded and carefully put her foot down. "I'll take you to Doctor Fukuda."</p><p>"Thank you, Shiro!" She gave him a quick bow.</p><p>Shiro was taken aback that she knew his name. All the while he thought that she was merely being polite when she nodded or smiled at him. She noticed him after all. The thought made his heart skip a beat. He suddenly felt warm all over. A smile tugged the corners of his lips.</p><p>"Let me get my load and I'll give you a piggyback ride to the Doc," he said. He couldn't hide the delight in his voice at the opportunity to help her.</p><p>The events of that afternoon were the beginnings of their friendship that soon after blossomed into love. A year and a half later, Shiro asked Mizuki Taisho for his daughter's hand in marriage. The Mizuki family approved of the match and he and Chiyo became engaged.</p><p>A month before their wedding, the political tension brewing in the capital erupted into turmoil. It was the end of the Tokugawa Era and the dawn of the Meiji Restoration. The thrust of the new era was modernization and westernization to keep up with the other world powers. The old traditions were set aside since they were deemed antiquated and backward. The carrying of swords was banned. The samurai who once held a privileged status in society no longer enjoyed it. Those who held steadfast to the old code and refused to relinquish their swords were viewed as threats to the new government. To bring these samurais under control, a new police force was sent forth</p><p>When the new police force was sent to their village, the peace was shattered. The village became gripped by fear and injustice. The samurais who once maintained peace resorted to violence. They were furious. They could not believe that the emperor, the imperial court whom they have faithfully served and fiercely protected had forsaken them. They felt betrayed. Once rid of the police and the village fortified, they quickly corresponded with other disgruntled clans and planned to take action. Soon, a plot of an open rebellion was set and the samurais were called to arms.</p><p>"Please... please don't go."</p><p>Chiyo's voice was hoarse with emotion. She was kneeling on the tatami by the entrance hall pleading with Shiro. She had begged her father not to go but his sense of honor and duty prevailed. Now, she was making a final and desperate appeal to make her fiancé stay.</p><p>Shiro knelt down and took her hands in his. "I need to go. Please understand." He searched for signs of understanding in her face but only found stubbornness. Her eyes glazed from unshed tears flickered with a myriad of emotions – pain, fear, anger, love, sadness and despair. Her cheeks were flushed. Her lips were drawn in a tight line and her jaws set.</p><p>Despite her expression, he knew she understood very well his duty as a samurai but she would not, could not accept it. He always loved her passionate nature, her strong conviction for things she believed in, but now it made leaving difficult. Couldn't she see that it also pained him to leave? Couldn't she trust him to come back to her? Why did she have so little faith in him?</p><p>"No!" She said fiercely. Her body trembled. Her hands tightly clasped his. "If you won't stay, I'll come with you."</p><p>Shiro shook his head in refusal. "You must stay here," he said gently but with finality.</p><p>"My place is by your side," she reasoned.</p><p>"Please, Chiyo-chan," he pleaded with her. "Please try to understand that I have my duty and you have yours." He tenderly placed a hand on her cheek.</p><p>She looked away from him, withdrawing from his touch. She was stung by the truth of his words. She could not argue with that.</p><p>"Look at me," he gently commanded but she did not move. "Look at me." He placed a knuckle under her chin and urged her to look at him.</p><p>When she did, what he saw tore at his heart. She no longer held back her tears. Her eyes were brimming with them. A tear slowly rolled down and stained her cheek and more followed. Her chin quivered. Her gaze was intense. He roughly took her into his arms. She began to tremble and eventually her body was racked with sobs. He held her until her sobs subsided and whispered soothing words into her ear. He never wanted to see her like this. He never wanted to make her cry again and that he silently vowed.</p><p>Shiro drew away from her, his hands moving up and down her arms in an effort to bring comfort. He gazed into her eyes, her thick lashes wet with tears. He laid his hand on his gift, the necklace that she wore. He cleared the lump of emotion in his throat before he began to speak.</p><p>"I will be back," he swore, his voice hoarse. "And I will be yours and you will be mine forever. This..."—he paused and gently brushed his thumb on the blue pendant—"will be the seal of my pledge to you." The jewel seemed to gleam in response to his promise.</p><p>She looked at him intensely, pinning all her hopes on what he had said.</p><p>He looked back at her with equal intensity. His gaze traveled all over her face, from her soft brown eyes to her luscious pink lips, as if memorizing her beautiful face. He leaned down, planted a chaste kiss on her brow and a passionate one on her lips. He roughly ended it because it was shattering his resolve, hastily stood up, walked out of the house and never looked back.</p><p>Shiro returned to his village ten months after the samurai rebellion was crushed by the government. It took him that long to recover from his injuries. His memories of that year were a blur. He remembered falling in the battlefield on the samurais' last and valiant attempt to win the battle. He was mortally wounded. He felt his life ebbing away as blood flowed from his wounds. His final memory before he succumbed to the darkness was Chiyo beckoning him to come back home, to come back to her.</p><p>He had awakened in dark room, lying on a bamboo cot. His head was spinning. His whole body ached. He tried to sit up but hot searing pain from his wounds made him lie back down. He groaned.</p><p>A shaft of light suddenly illuminated the darkness. He squinted at its source to see who had entered the room. Instinctively, his hand tried to reach for the hilt of his sword but he found none. In panic, he tried to reach for anything to fend off the intruder. His shout came out as a moan.</p><p>"Ssshhh." A rough hand gently touched his forehead. He struggled to move away.</p><p>"Ssshhh. Don't be afraid." It was an old woman's voice. Her gnarled hands grasped his arms to hold him still. "I'm here to help you." He stopped his feeble struggling partly because of the woman's assurance and partly because the effort robbed him of his strength. She let go of him.</p><p>"Where am I?" he croaked. "What am I doing here? Who are you? Where's Chiyo?"</p><p>She chortled. "One at a time, son. I'll answer all your questions later. You must eat first."</p><p>Arashino Yumi was the name of the old woman who had nursed him back to health. She was a widowed medicine woman living with her son and his family. She told him that while she was out in search for medicinal plants to replenish her stock, she had found him sprawled under a big tree, bloody and half-dead. It had been two days since the battle. She heard from a few wounded soldiers she had treated that it was a slaughter and none of the samurais had survived so she was astonished to see him still alive. His strong will to survive had impressed her but it was quickly seeping away. Death's shadow was upon the youth's face, making her hasten to get her son to bring him back to their house.</p><p>Now, he was back in his village, miraculously healed from his fatal wounds. Hope blossomed in his heart. He was home at last as he had promised and was looking forward to seeing his beautiful Chiyo and starting forever with her. What greeted him made his blood run cold.</p><p>Where Chiyo and her family's simple but beautiful house once stood was an empty lot save for piles of burned wood and stone. Weeds and vines had started to reclaim the area.</p><p>He stood there stunned. He could not believe what he was seeing. <i>There must be some mistake. I must have made a wrong turn. This isn't it.</i></p><p>He look around him searching for signs that he made a mistake, took a wrong turn and was facing the wrong lot. To his despair, the ancient cherry tree that grew near Chiyo's house was there. He vaguely saw the names – his and Chiyo's – etched on its trunk.</p><p><i>No, it can't be</i>. He shook his head, not willing to accept what he was seeing. <i>No...</i></p><p>A woman of around forty was passing by carrying a basket full of vegetables in both hands.</p><p>"Is this the Mizukis'?" Shiro asked though he did not look at the woman.</p><p>"I beg your pardon?" She stopped, unsure whether she was the one being addressed.</p><p>"Is this the Mizukis'?" This time he said it a little a louder.</p><p>"Was, sir," she replied and shook her head at the tragedy that had befallen the family.</p><p>"Was? It can't be," he denied aloud as if trying to convince himself. "What happened?" he demanded.</p><p>"Well, I heard that a few weeks after the grand samurai Mizuki left for the rebellion, the house was ransacked and burned to the ground." She sadly glanced at the ruins and continued, "And the whole household, mostly women and children, was murdered by an unknown group of mercenaries. Rumor has it that the government was behind it. A clean-up job to avoid any other rebellions." She clucked her tongue. "It wasn't right. No, sir, it wasn't. It was tragic especially for the beautiful Chiyo-chan and her fiancé. Tragic indeed. And you know..."</p><p>His brow furrowed. His jaw was clenched and a muscle on his throat began to twitch. His hands at his sided slowly balled into fists as he tried to control the pain and anger seething inside him and the urge to shake the woman to take her words back. <i>It's all a lie. It can't be.</i>He stood there silently staring at the ruins.</p><p>The woman continued to speak but he did not hear her words. It was drowned out by the turmoil inside of him. He did not even notice the woman leave. He just continued to stare at the ruins as if it could make Chiyo and everything else come back.</p><p>Memories of Chiyo haunted his vision. He saw her standing where the kitchen should have been, preparing dinner. She had nipped her finger and he had kissed it to make it better. He saw her kneeling by the dining table patiently helping him practice his writing. He saw himself giving her a bouquet of wild flowers by the entrance hall. She had been so delighted that she boldly planted a kiss on his cheek. So many memories came flooding back. <i>Chiyo... my beloved Chiyo...</i></p><p>An unearthly moan of great sadness, regret and hopelessness escaped his lips. His vision blurred as hot tears suddenly welled up in his eyes. He fell to his knees as the first tear rolled down his cheek. He bowed his head and allowed himself to weep, his tears staining the ground. <i>Chiyo...</i> As if in sympathy to his anguish, it began to rain.</p><p><i>I'm bound to fulfill my promise, bound to the necklace. I swear, Chiyo, I will fulfill my vow and we shall be together for eternity.</i></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Shiro-kun?"</p><p>Shiro blinked, returning from the dark memories of his past. He felt a warm hand on his shoulder. Slowly, he turned his head to his right. Chiyo's, no, Akane's beautiful face came into focus. The beautiful blue pendant of the necklace he had given her sparkled in the afternoon sun.</p><p>"Shiro-kun, are you okay?"</p><p>His face broke into a smile. The concern he heard in her voice and saw on her face made him euphoric. "Akane! You came!" Despite his certainty of her arrival, he was still overwhelmed to see her there.</p><p>"Yeah, I did." Shiro's smile was so infectious that Akane couldn't help but smile back at him. "Anyway, are you sure you're okay? It took me more than a minute to get you back to earth."</p><p>"Yeah! I'm fine." he exclaimed. "Everything's just perfect." <i>Perfect</i>, he thought excitedly. <i>Soon we'll be together, my Chiyo.</i> <i>Soon we will have our eternity.</i></p><p>Akane looked at him skeptically for a minute then shrugged. "Well, if you say so." She looked around and saw the same picnic basket he brought yesterday. "So what did you prepare for us today?" She turned to him with a grin.</p><p>"Well, we'll just have to see." He grinned back at her, gently took hold of her elbow and led her towards the picnic basket and blanket. He couldn't help but keep glancing at her beautiful profile and the necklace that helped him find her again.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma was content. He was seated at the counter of Ucchan's Okonomiyaki, rubbing his distended belly and sighing with satisfaction. A pile of empty plates was stacked in front of him. Ukyo was happily cooking another shrimp okonomiyaki for him... for free. <i>What a life!</i> he happily thought to himself. His little spat with Akane was almost forgotten.</p><p>"Ucchan, you're the best!"</p><p>"Oh, Ran-chan!" Ukyo splayed her hands on her reddening cheeks. "Do you really mean that?" She quickly tossed a steaming shrimp okonomiyaki into a plate, slid it in front of Ranma like a bribe and looked at him expectantly for his reply.</p><p>"Of course!" Ranma grinned. "You make the best okonomiyaki in town, no, make that the best in the whole of Japan."</p><p>As if Ranma's word were a profession love, Ukyo reddened even more. "Oh, stop it, Ran-chan!" Ukyo suddenly took out her gigantic spatula and swung it at Ranma.</p><p>BANG! It hit its spot.</p><p>"Whadd'ya do dat por?" Ranma's eyes slowly rolled up his head. "Dat hart..." croaked Ranma as he fell off his stool.</p><p>"Oh, I'm so sorry!" Ukyo quickly jumped over the counter, grabbed him by the collar and hauled him onto the counter.</p><p>Embarrassed, Ukyo turned her back on him, mumbling apologies. She abruptly stopped as she heard a sizzling sound. Then, a stench of burning fabric wafted up her nose. Swiftly, she turned around and caught sight of Ranma as he sprang off the counter screaming, "HOT! HOT! HOT!" Half the back of his favorite red shirt was burned to a crisp. Ukyo hastily jumped over the counter, took a pitcher of ice cold water and threw its contents at Ranma.</p><p>The door slid open. Yuka and Sayuri entered Ucchan's.</p><p>"Hi Ukyo! We'll have—"</p><p>Yuka and Sayuri stopped and stared at a sputtering and drenched girl-type Ranma. Her red hair plastered to her head. Her red shirt slightly burned but wet clung to her curves.</p><p>"Hey Ranma! What happened to you?" Yuka eyed him curiously.</p><p>"Nothing!" Ranma muttered and glared at Ukyo.</p><p>"I'm sorry!" Ukyo smiled sheepishly and tossed him a small towel. "I'll make it up to you with another okonomiyaki with the works." She immediately took on the task and busied herself mixing an okonomiyaki batter. "What will you two be having?"</p><p>"Nothing eh," Yuka whispered and gave Sayuri a meaningful look.</p><p>Sayuri shook her head disapprovingly then turned to Ukyo and said, "We'll have the two seafood specials, Ukyo."</p><p>"Two seafood specials. Got it!" said Ukyo as she poured the batter for Ranma's okonomiyaki onto the griddle.</p><p>Ranma dried her drenched hair and torso with the towel and quickly threw it back to Ukyo. She took her seat, pushed the plate with the shrimp okonomiyaki toward Ukyo and grumpily said, "I'll have this to go. Thanks!"</p><p>He then realized that Akane wasn't with her friends as she had said. "Hey, isn't Akane with you guys?"</p><p>"We should be asking you that question." Sayuri said as she and Yuka took seats at the bar. They looked at Ranma accusingly.</p><p>Ranma stared back in surprise. "What? She told me that she was going to YOUR house." She pointedly looked at Sayuri when she said <i>your house</i>.</p><p>"Well, she told us that Kasumi asked her to clean the dojo this afternoon. Since you're her fiancée, shouldn't you be at home helping her with the task?" Sayuri pointed out matter-of-factly. Yuka was nodding in agreement beside her.</p><p>Ranma looked at them bewildered. "Kasumi said nothing to me about cleaning the dojo today."</p><p>"Oh, you must have just forgotten, Ranma," Ukyo nonchalantly said as she placed Ranma's steaming special okonomiyaki in a takeout box. Two more were sizzling on the hot cooking surface.</p><p>"Yeah," Yuka agreed. Her issue with Ranma was momentarily forgotten as she hungrily eyed the delicious sizzling okonomiyakis.</p><p>"No." said Ranma silently, shaking her head. Her brow furrowed.</p><p>Ukyo dangled the two takeout boxes of okonomiyaki in front of Ranma and happily said, "Here you go, Ran—"</p><p>With her arm still outstretched with the takeout boxes, she stood stunned as she saw Ranma run out the door of Ucchan's Okonomiyaki.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p><i>I can't believe it!</i>Ranma thought furiously as she ran home. <i>And to think I was feeling a bit guilty about our little spat. Akane lied to me! She lied to me! Again! WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?</i></p><p>When she arrived home, she went straight to the training hall. An empty dojo. She gave a huff of annoyance. She briskly made her way to the kitchen.</p><p>The clink of the knife on the cutting board, the low whistle of a kettle of boiling water and the simmer of broth in a pan were the sounds that greeted Ranma as she entered the kitchen. Kasumi was busy preparing tonight's dinner. The smell and sight of food being prepared assaulted Ranma's senses but tonight it did little to abate his anger.</p><p>"Kasumi, have you seen Akane?" asked Ranma in a clipped tone. She hastily took a kettle of boiling water on the stove and poured the water on herself. It was scalding. She gritted her teeth to stop herself from screaming. Her stupid error only fueled her anger.</p><p>She turned into a he.</p><p>"No, Ranma," Kasumi replied without looking up from her chore. She did not notice the scowl that darkened his handsome face.</p><p>"Did you ask her to clean the dojo today?"</p><p>"No, there's no need. I just cleaned it yesterday." Kasumi took the chopped vegetables and tossed them into the boiling broth on the stove. "Why do you ask?" She glanced at him.</p><p>"Nothing." He turned to leave. He was now more furious after confirming Akane's lie. He was mad.</p><p>"Oh my!" Kasumi gasped as she saw his half-burnt shirt. "Are you all right?"</p><p>Her question fell on deaf ears. He had stomped off out of the kitchen door.</p><p>Ranma went upstairs, taking two steps at a time. He threw his bag carelessly into the room that he and his Pop shared when he passed it by and immediately made his way to Akane's room.</p><p>"Akane!" Ranma slammed an open palm on her door. "Open this door, Akane! I want to talk to you!"</p><p>"What is all that racket?"</p><p>Nabiki poked her head out of her room. She looked disgruntled.</p><p>"Have you seen Akane?" growled Ranma.</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow and smirked. "My, my, a bit grouchy this afternoon, aren't we, Ranma?"</p><p>He took a deep breath and tried his best to repeat his question calmly.</p><p>"I last saw her at school with you."</p><p>He gave her a curt nod and turned to leave.</p><p>"I have a feeling that my theory's not at all outrageous." Her words made him stop in mid step. His whole body quivered with tension. Encouraged that she had hit a nerve, she went on and said, "I bet she's with the guy right now."</p><p>His body become more rigid and began emitting a strange blue light, his battle aura.</p><p>She smiled amusedly at his reaction. It was funny how Ranma was taking her too seriously. He was so gullible, she thought, rolling her eyes. To stop herself from saying anything else, she quietly closed her door.</p>
