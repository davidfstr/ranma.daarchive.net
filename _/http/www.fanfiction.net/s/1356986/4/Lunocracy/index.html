</div><p>Disclaemr:  The following work was done by thousands of monkeys on thousands of typewrighters plagerizing the works of Ranma 1/2 and Sailor Moon for the enjoyment of others.</p><p>Don't sue the monkeys as they have no pants.</p><p>Chapter 4: Meet the Folks</p><p>The girls were stunned by his story. Minako and Makoto wanted to 'save' him from those evil girls. Rei wanted to know how he stopped himself from killing his father for all the crap that he put him through.  Ami wanted measurements. Artemis wanted out of the room so he could get a head start on Luna for all the good it would do him. Finally Usagi wanted a triple fudge sundae.</p><p>Luna of course wanted to go with him.</p><p>She was quite vocal about it as well.</p><p>"What are you talking about? Of course I want to go with him!" Luna said in a tone that said that she was going and that was that.</p><p>"But Luna what if another monster attacks? What are we going to do without you?" Usagi whined.</p><p>Luna flattened her ears against her head.</p><p>"I thought I taught you better than that." She hissed. "If a monster shows up kill it as usual. When in doubt just do what Ami tells you to do." Luna sometimes wondered just who the leader of the scouts actually was. Ami was a poor fighter but a brilliant tactician.</p><p>"But... But... " Usagi looked like she was going to cry at any moment now.</p><p>Luna let out a huge sigh.</p><p>"Don't worry I'm not leaving you. I'm only going to visit him for a few days that's all." She said in a motherly voice.</p><p>"Speaking of which we should be getting going now if we're going to be home for supper." Ranma said looking at the clock on the wall.</p><p>"Couldn't we just take the train?" Luna asked.</p><p>"We could but we'd be riding outside which I guess would be ok."  Ranma said as he scratched the back of his head.</p><p>"So we're running then." Luna said flatly.</p><p>"Don't worry I'm much faster than I used to be." Running away from fiancee's all the time really upped his speed a lot.</p><p>"Then let's go!" Luna said as she jumped on his shoulder. "I'll be back in a couple of days."</p><p>"Later!"  Ranma said as he walked through the door and jumped to the nearest roof.</p><p>There was a pregnant pause during which all of the girls were thinking.  Finally Makoto spoke up.</p><p>"He's mine I saw him first."</p><p>"No way you did I saw him first!" Minako countered.</p><p>From there the impromptu meeting degraded into a chaotic free for all as to who was going to get first crack at Ranma.</p><p>Rei of course was enjoying Naruto on her new system.</p><p>The scenery was streaking past at blinding speeds as Ranma and Luna made their way back to the Tendo dojo in Nerima. Since it was a fair ways away from the Cherry Hill Temple it was going to take them some time even at the speeds that Ranma was traveling at. Luna decided now would be a good time to take a nap as she wanted to be fresh and alert when she met Ranma's adopted family.</p><p>Truth be told she was a little disappointed that Ranma already had three fiancee's. She was hoping to set him up with the princess or one or more of the scouts. She tolerated Mamorou because Usagi liked him but in all honesty she thought that she deserved better than that dickless wonder that would come in throw a freaking rose, offer some half assed words of encouragement and then leave. If she could get Ranma a magic weapon or something he'd be twenty times more effective than that flower boy.</p><p>As it was she'd have to ask Ami about it when she got back. For right now she would have to evaluate these other girls and see if any of them were right for Ranma.</p><p>She yawned as she synced her ki with Ranma's so that she wouldn't fall off his shoulder. It was a technique that she developed on the road so she could sleep on his shoulder without fear of falling off.</p><p>Yes those girls would get a thorough examination and if she wasn't satisfied she'd do everything to break the engagements.</p><p>Her Ranma deserved much better and Luna was going to make sure he got the best mates.</p><p>Once Ranma reached a few blocks from the dojo he dropped down into an alley and hid his cat features. There was a flash of light and a brief surge of ki as he did so. This surge disrupted Luna's ki anchor and she unceremoniously dropped off his shoulder.  She was awake and had righted herself so that she would land on her feet.</p><p>"What'd you do that for?" She asked as she looked down at the filthy ground.</p><p>"We're almost there. Nobody at home knows about this so I have to hide them." He said as he indicated where his ears and tail were.</p><p>"Oh."  Luna said as she jumped back onto his shoulder. "I just didn't expect it to disrupt my ki anchor that's all." She said as she settled back in.</p><p>Ranma walked out of the alley with Luna perched securely on his shoulder.  As luck would have it Shampoo was riding by on her bike with a delivery. She was about to jump off and glomp him when she saw that he had a cat on his shoulder. The shear shock value alone was enough to cause her to slam face first into a telephone pole. Ranma of course missed the entire thing. Luna was considering asking but then thought better of it. Maybe it was normal for this district for young girls to run full tilt into telephone poles. Then again Ranma was fairly attractive for his species so maybe that was it. She'd have to do some more investigation and see if that was a normal occurrence before asking him about it.</p><p>Soon they came to the gates of the Tendo compound. Luna looked around taking in the scene. She admired the house and strong high walls.  It even had it's own sushi bar with the koi pond. All in all it looked like a fairly nice place to live. She'd have to remember to bug Usagi into getting a koi pond or maybe a fish tank full of fish.  Soothing, calming, relaxing, edible art.</p><p>There was a young girl about a couple of years older than Ranma sweeping the sidewalk just outside the gate. To Luna's senses she radiated calm and peace. She also looked to be the matronly kind of person.  Definitely a good cook if the clean apron could be any indicator.  This one scored highly on Luna's affinity meter if for nothing else than a warm lap to sleep in and good petting.</p><p>"Hey Kasumi." Ranma said as he approached.</p><p>"Hello Ranma. Oh my isn't that a cute cat on your shoulder." She replied as her view of reality was taken and ripped to shreds.</p><p>"Nah.  Luna's not a cat, she's a mongoose. She used to be my pet before pops faked her death and made me believe she was dead. Speaking of which is the old man around?" Ranma said as he gave her a pat on the head. Luna of course had given up over the years at trying to make him call her a cat. She just chocked it up to a self defense mechanism and stopped caring. Besides it was interesting the different animals she was called.</p><p>"Of course. He and father are playing shouji on the veranda." She said as a yeti riding a bull with crane and eels with octopus tentacles walked by in the background and waved at her before continuing on.</p><p>"Thanks Kasumi." He said as he walked past her towards the main house.</p><p>Once he was safely out of sight Kasumi reached into the pocket of her apron and pulled out several mushrooms that she'd found growing in the yard. She'd planned on making them into sukiyaki tonight. She wound up and tossed them as far away as she could. Halucinagenic mushrooms always gave her gas anyway.</p><p>Inside the house Ranma removed his shoes and left them by the entryway. He headed towards the veranda where he knew his old man was playing that stupid game with Mr. Tendo. Sure enough as he rounded the corner he saw his pops and Mr. Tendo infront of the board.</p><p>"Hey pops." He said.</p><p>"Shouldn't you still be in school?" Genma said not taking his eyes off the board for fear that Tendo would capitalize on his moment of weakness and change the pieces around to his own advantage.</p><p>"Yeah well Akane hit me all the way to Juuban so I missed school." He said as he took Luna from his shoulder.</p><p>"Boy you've got to get along with your fiancee better." Genma groused. How was he supposed to retire if his stupid son couldn't even keep his mouth shut and eat the slop his loving fiancee made for him.</p><p>"Yeah whatever. Hey pops guess who I found wandering around Juuban."  Ranma said as he hefted Luna.</p><p>"I don't really care if you ran into that directionally challenged idiot." Genma replied. Honestly it was like his son expected him to actually care about his life or something. The nerve of the boy.</p><p>"Actually pop you know her already." Ranma said.</p><p>"Who is it? I'm pretty sure I didn't engage you to any other girls."  Genma said aloud still not turning to face his child.</p><p>"Luna pops. Come on how could you forget about her?" Ranma said as he wound up and tossed Luna at his father.</p><p>"Lu..."  Genma said as he finally turned his head only to be hit head on by a flying kick by an enraged moon cat.</p><p>What followed was a pretty intense beating on both sides. Luna was getting her mad on for being ditched all those years ago and Genma was trying his best to not be turned into a scratching post.</p><p>Soun turned from the scene to see if Ranma was going to assist his father subdue the wild cat.</p><p>"Son how dare you let that wild cat attack your father! Aren't you going to help him!"</p><p>"Nah.  Luna's not a cat she's a svelte badger and pop's has got this coming to him." Ranma sat down in the spot that his pop had occupied and watched as Luna delivered a particularly good uppercut to the old man's family jewels.</p><p>Both Soun and Ranma winced at this.</p><p>"Hold on Saotome I'm coming!" Soun shouted just before Ranma knocked him unconscious.</p><p>"Go Luna!" Ranma shouted from his place on the veranda.</p><p>"Oh my Ranma kun your cat seems to not like Mr. Saotome." Kasumi said as she tried to feign caring.</p><p>"I don't know why everybody calls her a cat. She's a mutant gopher.  She has every right not to like pops after everything he put her through. Besides she's got a few years of anger to work through."  Ranma said as Luna finished burying his old man.</p><p>Luna flung some more dirt over the spot where she had buried Genma. The only indication that he was there was his hand sticking out of the ground. Once she was satisfied that he was properly punished she decided to go back to where Ranma was and see if she could score points with that Kasumi girl.</p><p>"Ranma shouldn't you go help your father he could suffocate you know."  Kasumi said as she watched Luna walk back towards where she was standing.</p><p>"Nah he'll be fine... I think. Besides I think she's just getting even for the time he buried both of us six feet down to teach us how to get out if we're ever buried in a landslide or something."  Ranma said remembering the incident.</p><p>He watched as Luna bypassed him and went to rub up against Kasumi's legs. He was not surprised since everybody he knew liked Kasumi and he didn't expect Luna to be any different. Kasumi bent over and picked her up off the floor and cradled her in her arms.</p><p>"Ranma are you sure this is your cat? I mean she looks normal. Maybe your father didn't fake her death." Kasumi said as she started petting Luna.</p><p>"Oh I'm sure that's Luna. You see that crescent moon on her forehead.  It's like a birthmark or something. She's the only cat that I know of that has that." He said as he watched her being petted.  "That and the notch cut out of her ear was from the wolves. I don't think she's quite forgotten that yet though." He watched as Luna started purring up a storm. "I think she likes you."</p><p>"She's such a nice badger. Oh my I wonder what badgers eat." She said trying to figure out what to feed her.</p><p>"She likes fish. Pretty much any kind will do. She also has a thing for sake." He lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Just don't give her too much she can be an angry drunk."</p><p>Of course Luna heard this. She turned her head and growled at him. Kasumi, not wanting to be anywhere near a pissed off cat, dropped Luna.</p><p>Like most cats Luna landed on her feet. Unlike most cats she decided that Ranma needed to be taught who his master was and decided to attack him with fur and claws flying.</p><p>Ranma who had been expecting an attack, because honestly that's what he said it for, dodged Luna's initial lunge and danced out into the yard so he would have room to go airborne. Luna may be good but he was much better thanks to all the techniques he'd picked up from various sources.</p><p>Kasumi watched the boy and his 'cat' playing in the yard. She glanced to where Mr. Saotome had been buried and sure enough there was only a crater where he'd been. Kasumi frowned as she knew that she'd be the one who had to fill in the hole and replant the grass. She couldn't really fault Luna because she was just a dumb animal and didn't know the work she was creating. Maybe she could get Ranma to do it.</p><p>"Hey sis what's up?" Nabiki said as she looked out into the yard.</p><p>"Ranma found his pet cat and now they're sparring in the yard." Kasumi said as she turned to go into the kitchen to start supper.</p><p>"Umm sis wasn't Ranma afraid of cats?" Nabiki said as she watched Luna take a swipe at Ranma and miss.</p><p>"Oh he's just in denial." Kasumi called back from the kitchen.</p><p>"I'm home!" Akane called from the front door.</p><p>"Hey Akane come here you've got to see this!" Nabiki called watching Ranma get a good hit in.</p><p>"What's u..." Akane trailed off as she watched Ranma fighting in the yard with a cat and not running away in terror.</p><p>Of course Akane's train of thought immediately switched tracks, derailed then exploded in a flaming ball of fury.</p><p>"RAAANMAAA you pervert!" Hear the battle cry of the tomboy.</p><p>"Wha?"  Ranma said a he reflexively turned his head to look where the scream came from just in time to see Akane's trademarked mallet descending.</p><p>"Serves you right making us believe you're afraid of cats." She huffed.  She still hadn't forgiven him for kissing her infront of the school when he was in the 'neko ken'.</p><p>Luna seeing the attack on Ranma arched her back and hissed at the girl.  She'd heard the name Akane being used and belatedly connected the dots. This violent girl was one of Ranma's fiancee's. Sufficed to say Ranma wasn't kidding when he described her. Infact he probably understated her personality a lot. Based on the opposing ki field she was giving off Luna automatically didn't like her. Hearing Ranma try to pull his head out of the ground and the girl Akane winding up for another swing Luna made a snap decision to do something. She stepped infront of Ranma and let off a low warning growl. Now to most creatures when something is growling at you it's a good indication to get the hell away from that area. Unfortunately Akane never was one for seeing signs.</p><p>As Akane was bringing the mallet down to inflict more punishment on her deserving fiancee Luna launched herself towards her mallet arm intending to disarm her before thrashing her like she so royally deserved. What she did to Minako would seem like a love tap compared to what she planned to do to this girl. Akane was wholly unprepared for such a small cat to attack her with such ferocity.</p><p>Ranma pulled his head out of the ground and shook it to dislodge as much dirt as he could. He was wondering why Akane wasn't smashing him down again. She usually didn't stop until he was unconscious. He looked up just in time to see Luna flinging Akane around like a rag doll in the jaws of a pit bull.</p><p>"Luna put her down!" Ranma yelled.</p><p>Reluctantly Luna dropped the hapless girl and trotted over to where Ranma was sitting on the ground. She hopped into his lap and urged him to start petting her. Instead of aquissessing to her demands he got off the ground and put her on his shoulder. He then walked over to where Akane was still lying face down on the ground. He picked her up by the back of her school jumper and hauled her over to the veranda and then flipped her over so that she was lying on her back. He then left her there.</p><p>"That's some cat you've got there Saotome." Nabiki said as she narrowed her eyes.</p><p>"Luna?  I keep telling people she's a diabetic beaver. She's my best friend." He said with a happy smile.</p><p>Nabiki was taken aback by this. Sure she'd seen him smile before but those were usually cocky 'I'm going to win' smiles. Other times the smile was forced and obviously looked fake. Now however she could see the happiness radiating off the boy. She had to bat away one of the little pink hearts that floated her way. She had no need for such things.</p><p>"Is it just me or did I see Luna doing some Anything goes moves?"  Nabiki asked as she looked at the cat with the halo above it's head.</p><p>"Well yeah. Pops thought since she was coming with us she should learn Anything Goes as well." Ranma said as he pulled Luna from his shoulder and held her out to Nabiki.</p><p>"Sorry I don't like cats." Nabiki said as she turned and walked to the kitchen to see what Kasumi was doing.</p><p>"Come on Luna I'll show you my room." Ranma said as he dashed up the stairs to the guest room.</p><p>Genma had of course taken up residence in the guest room to recover from the beating that cat had given him. He grumbled to himself that he should have never taught that furball Anything Goes.  With her natural speed it was damn near impossible to hit the bloody thing. She didn't hit very hard though but that was pretty much the only saving grace as she made up for it in the number of times she hit.</p><p>Just as he was about to lay down for a rest the door slid open and in walked Ranma with that demon cat of his. He tensed not wanting to be turned into a scratching post twice in one day.</p><p>"Hey pops. I think Mr. Tendo should be waking up about now. You'd better hurry before he rearranges your shouji board." Ranma said as he walked further into the room.</p><p>"Mrrrrrr"  Luna said as she too wanted to get rid of the fat man and talk to his son alone.</p><p>"Ahh yes I can't let Tendo get the upper hand now can I." He said nervously as he jumped out of the window.</p><p>"Well then we're alone now." Ranma said as he closed the door. "So what do you think so far?"</p><p>"I think you should dump Akane and get engaged to that Kasumi girl."  Luna stated flatly.</p><p>"Yeah Kasumi's nice and all but I mean she's four years older than I am AND she's pretty boring." Ranma said as he sat down under the window leaning up against the wall.</p><p>"I haven't been here long enough to really get a judge on her personality." Luna said as she urged him to start petting her.</p><p>"What do you think of Akane and Nabiki?" Ranma said although he already knew the answer.</p><p>"I don't like Akane. You really understated her temper though."  She said as she started kneading his leg. "I won't see you in that kind of relationship. As for Nabiki I think she's too smart for her own good. I think she suspects that I'm not a normal cat."  Luna said as she turned around in his lap. "I would like to meet Shampoo and Sakura and see what they're like."</p><p>"Yeah sure. Although I do have to warn you..."</p><p>"Meow."  Came a voice from above his head.</p><p>Ranma slowly tilted his head up so he could visually confirm that there was a real feline above his head. Sure enough he made eye contact with a cute as a button cat with white and pinkish purple fur. His mind was in such a terror filled mode that he never noticed the beads in the cats fur.</p><p>"CAAAAAATTTTTTTT!"  Ranma screamed as he tore out of the room running right through the door to get away from the cat.</p><p>"Alright you pampered pussy now you've got a load of hurt coming." Luna was furious that her petting was interrupted by this upstart.</p><p>The cat seemed to freeze and fall from the window. It must have been pampered all it's life if it was this clumsy. Luna decided that she wouldn't punish it too much but that didn't stop her from taking the advantage while it was picking itself of the floor to attack. The resulting fight was short but anything but decisive.  The 'pampered' cat fought surprisingly well for one that had led a life of luxury and Luna found herself having to take up the level of her attacks to very near her maximum level.</p><p>The fight ended with Luna standing over an obviously injured cat. She belatedly cursed herself for going that far on somebody's pet. The other cat struggled to her feet and limped over to where Luna was still standing. The other cat's head was bowed in submission. Luna was going to give the other cat a lick to signify that all was forgiven when the other cat darted forward aiming for her neck. Luna turned her head to intercept and they ended up in liplock.</p><p>"Why you little..." Luna growled out.</p><p>Apparently the other cat got the message because she turned around and bolted out of the room through the open window as fast as her injured kitty legs would carry her. Luna huffed as she spat on the floor. Pampered or not she didn't want to be going around kissing other cats.</p><p>Deciding that for now finding Ranma took priority she decided to go search for him.</p><p>Finding Ranma was surprisingly easy. All she needed to do was follow the path of destruction. She eventually tracked him to the tree in the yard. Somehow he'd changed into a girl and was now huddling near the top of the tree. Letting out a sigh she jumped onto the first branch of the tree and continued upwards until she was sitting across from where he was cowering.</p><p>"The cat's gone now Ranma you can come down." Luna said in a whisper.</p><p>"You sure?" Ranma said in a small voice.</p><p>"Yup I whipped her ass good. Sneaky little bugger though she tried to go for my neck at the end there." Luna said as she pumped her fist in the air. "By the way you were going to tell me something about this Shampoo girl you're engaged to."</p><p>"Oh yeah I was going to tell you to watch out for her. She's got a curse like mine except that she turns into a little c..c..cat with white and purple fur and beads around her head. If you see her try to act like a normal cat ok?" Ranma said as he calmed down.</p><p>"Little cat, with white and purple fur and beads right?" Luna said.</p><p>"Yeah that's her. Also she's a pretty good fighter so I don't recommend fighting her."</p><p>Luna had a sinking feeling.</p><p>"Now hypothetically say I accidentally beat her in a fight..."</p><p>Cologne, matriarch of the Chinese Amazons, had seen much in her three hundred years of life. Her great granddaughter in her cursed cat form tearing through the door, jumping into one of the customers ramen bowls to change back into a human and then rambling on about how she gave the kiss of marriage to a talking cat was fairly high up on the list of weird things that she'd seen happen.</p><p>After she'd led the still naked Shampoo up to her room and made her put on some clothes she managed to extract the whole story from her. After hearing that her grand daughter somehow got beaten by a talking cat that son in law was somehow not afraid of, she was going to give the kiss of death but accidentally gave the kiss of marriage. Cologne waited a whole thirty seconds before pulling out the strong herbs. She packed her pipe till it was pretty full and lit up.</p><p>Shampoo waited nervously until the elder was finished 'contemplating' her situation. Hopefully the elder in her mind expanded state would be able to find a solution for her problem. She didn't want to marry a cat. Finally after what seemed like forever Cologne spoke.</p><p>"I've got the munchies." She said as she turned and pogoed out of the room.</p><p>Shampoo slammed into the floor in a near perfect facefault. The elder was obviously no help so it looked up to her to figure this out. She walked over to her armoire and opened one of the drawers. There was no way she'd be married to a cat.</p><p>Back at the Tendo home Ranma was lying on the ground groaning in pain.  After finding out that Shampoo was going to give Luna the kiss of death but fucked up he couldn't hold in his laughter and fell out of the tree. Luna wasn't so amused with the situation. Once she found out that she'd accidentally been given a kiss that promised to track down and marry any who received it. Artemis would tease her to no end if he found out that she was married to a human girl. No the sooner she could speak to this Shampoo the better. Maybe since only the two of them knew well ok three of them if you included Ranma; they could come to some agreement that the whole incident never happened.</p><p>"I'm glad you take so much pleasure out of my suffering." Luna stated flatly as she jumped from the top of the tree and landed on Ranma's stomach.</p><p>"Glad to serve."</p><p>"Now what are we going to do about Shampoo?" Luna said as she lay down on his chest so that she could whisper.</p><p>"Well do you prefer a western or traditional style wedding? O oo Can I be best man! Maybe you can get your friends to be brides maids?"  Ranma said trying to fake Minako's hyper blond style.</p><p>"I mean how do I get out of it!" Luna said digging all of her claws into his chest.</p><p>"Ow ow ow! Alright alright already." Ranma said as he held his hands up in surrender.</p><p>"Alright now what are we going to do?" Luna said as she relaxed her claws.</p><p>"Well as long as she hasn't told the old ghoul anything you should be fine." Ranma said.</p><p>"And if she has?" Luna said with a nervous sweat on her forehead.</p><p>"Traditional wedding." Ranma said as he flung Luna to the side and took off hoping to get away from her before she could retaliate.</p><p>"Get back here you!" Luna hissed as shouting would not have been a good idea with all the people around to here her.</p><p>A boy and his cat playing like two good friends.</p><p>Suppertime finally arrived and the whole household was gathered around the table. Luna was seated between Ranma and Akane. Kasumi had even prepared a special meal just for Luna and even gave her her own pillow to sit on. Kasumi's idea of catfood was a perfectly cooked fish and minced beef with catmint jelly. Luna's opinion of Kasumi just kept going higher and higher.</p><p>Akane was keeping a wary eye on Ranma's cat. He'd told everybody how they met and how they'd traveled and trained together. She was still wary of the vicious cat and tried many times to switch places with Kasumi or Nabiki. Kasumi said that she would only switch if Akane promised to never cook again and Nabiki just flat out refused claiming that she was allergic to alley cats.</p><p>So Akane jumped and twitched every time Luna even made the hint of a threatening move. If she couldn't torment Akane physically she'd just have to mess with the girls mind a bit. Luna thought that she'd have cracked the girls mind in two days tops.</p><p>Once she'd finished her food, she'd forgotten Genma's penchant for stealing both hers and his sons food, she inched quietly as she could using all of her stealth techniques to remain undetected. Once she had reached her goal, directly behind Akane, she released her stealth and let out a huge</p><p>"Mrowr!"</p><p>The sight of Akane performing Ranma's patented cling to the ceiling technique was almost enough to make Ranma choke on his food. Nabiki just narrowed her eyes at the cat that seemed so out to torment her little sister.</p><p>"Now Luna that wasn't very nice..." Kasumi chided.</p><p>Luna lowered her head. Getting scolded by Kasumi just felt wrong.</p><p>"even though she deserves it for being mean to Ranma." She finished as she took a sip of her tea.</p><p>Everybody was stunned by Kasumi's statement. Akane especially as she let go of the ceiling and fell onto her back.</p><p>It was during this stunned break in conversation that one of the doors exploded off it's track. As long time residents, the household knew that Shampoo had just come for a visit. Ranma knew that it was Shampoo AND he knew exactly why she'd come. Luna of course just knew that somebody blew off the doors.</p><p>When the dust cleared Luna's eyes widened as she saw a young girl about Ranma's age with a quite impressive figure. In one hand she had a coloured bonbori which she had just used to knock down the door. In her other hand she held a metal thermos. For some reason (Ranma knew why) she looked quite pissed off.</p><p>"Where Airen?" Shampoo said as she stalked into the room.</p><p>Everybody pointed at Ranma except for Ranma who pointed at Luna.</p><p>Shampoo walked over to where Luna was sitting and opened the thermos. Luna having no idea what was going to happen just sat there. She was wondering who the girl was and what she had in the thermos. She quickly found out as the girl poured the entire contents on her.</p><p>Where there was once a little black cat there now sat a naked girl with black hair and a crescent moon on her forehead. She would have stood 5'1" or maybe 5'2". She had long toned sleek legs and arms. She had an impressive bust, not for it's size but perkiness factor. Luna of course summed up the entire experience with three eloquent words.</p><p>"What the Fuck!" She screamed as she tried to jump up. She ended up losing her balance and falling on her ass.</p><p>"Luna?"  Ranma asked as he turned his head away. As a human Luna was definitely a looker.</p><p>"Talking kitty and Shampoo need talk now." Shampoo said as she grabbed Luna and started dragging her out of the room.</p><p>"Hey what are you!" Luna shouted as she attempted to throw the crazy girl.</p><p>Of course since she'd only had her human body for less than a minute she misjudged the toss and ended up slamming Shampoo  into the far wall.</p><p>"Woah she's as strong as Akane." Ranma remarked briefly turning back to where Luna was.</p><p>"Will somebody just tell me why I'm human now!" Luna yelled as she finally got to her feet. She was wobbling back and forth.</p><p>"Well since we know that if that was real drowned girl water Shampoo would have used it on herself to get rid of her curse so we can assume that was the instant stuff." Nabiki said with a smile. "But as we all know Jusenkyo can alter form and personality but it can't alter intelligence." She smiled like a shark closing in for a meal. "Added to that the fact that Shampoo called you a 'talking kitty' and we are left with the fact that Ranma here owns a talking intelligent possibly magical cat." Luna slapped her hands over her mouth just now realizing her error. Ranma slapped his hand to his forehead in a classic 'Doh' maneuver. Nabiki shook her head. "Only you Saotome would get yourself a talking magical cat as a pet."</p><p>"Oh my Luna you really shouldn't go around naked like that, it's just not proper." Kasumi said as she put her hand to her mouth. Here I'll go get you some of Ranma's clothes." She said as she got up and went outside to get the clothes off the line.</p><p>Shampoo who had been playing possum so that she could get a better idea of the skill level of the cat decided that now would be a good time to voice her opinion.</p><p>"Shampoo kill!" She shouted as she dashed across the room and attempted to bash Luna.</p><p>Luna who was still not used to being human tried to dodge but she was going to be a second too slow in the maneuver. Ranma of course had noticed the way Luna was not too steady on her feet yet so as soon as Shampoo had yelled her battle cry he'd been in motion. He managed to scoop up Luna into his arms and bound out of the house before Shampoo's mace managed to connect. He snagged his clothes from Kasumi that's she'd been bringing in and jumped to the nearest roof Shampoo hot on his heels.</p><p>Having a squirming, naked, and generally distracting cat/girl in his arms just wouldn't do. He tossed Luna into the air and engaged the Nerima instant clothing technique. It was the same technique that his father, Mousse, Shampoo and Ryoga used to get dressed so they wouldn't be naked just after transforming.</p><p>"Ranma put me down I can run just fine!" Luna shouted. Being carried like a damsel in distress was not her thing.</p><p>"Normally that'd be true but take it from me it's not. You were having problems just standing up before it's going to take you some time to get used to walking on two legs." He shot back as he dodged a... teaspoon? Sakura must have heard the commotion and come out to see him carrying some girl away from Shampoo. "Right now we have to do the Saotome Final Attack and get away. Then you can practice walking." Ranma said as he dodged out of Ryoga's way as he too accidentally joined the chase.</p><p>Things kept getting better and better as Kuno saw Ranma carrying an attractive girl and decided that since the cursed Saotome was interested in her that he should 'save' her for himself.</p><p>"Curse you Saotome. Not only do you have the beauteous Akane Tendo and pigtailed girl, but now you also covet the wild crescent girl. Does your lechery know no bounds?" Kuno raved as he too took up the chase.</p><p>"I don't know Ranma does your lechery know no bounds?" Luna whispered in his ear right before she gave him a tender lick on his cheek.</p><p>Ranma stumbled and fell down into an alley. Luckily he managed to right himself and land on his feet. Quickly getting his bearings he spotted an open door and dove inside. He quickly but quietly shut the door and listened as the herd thundered past in search of him.  Once he was certain that they'd gone he let out a huge sigh of relief.</p><p>Luna had to admit that this damsel in distress thing had it's advantages.  It felt really great to be held against Ranma's muscled chest. Sure she'd been held like this in the past but she was just a little cat.  Now that she was more proportionate it was a totally different experience. That added to the fact that she was human and certain things felt so different than when she was a cat. She now understood why girls liked this so much.</p><p>"So son in law this is the talking cat that my great grand daughter is now married to. I will admit that she is quite the looker."  Cologne said in her raspy voice.</p><p>Authors notes:</p><p>Another chapter of Lunocracy done. I decided to end it here because it was getting pretty long. I am amazed by the number of comments I'm getting from this story. Most of the comments have been good encouraging me to continue although there have been a couple of flames. I originally intended it to be something light not serious at all. It was originally something that I would write every so often just to kill writers block. Some people critizised me saying that Ranma should get into sailor combat and that my comments that only magic could dammage a youma were incorrect. I take your points seriously and that may be the case, however this story is not about Ranma battling monsters. If I have my way (which I will b/c I'm the author) Ranma won't get involved with any of the monsters the sailors fight. If you want Ranma fighting monsters read Fast Tracks. (Yes BlueEsper I'm going to continue it no need for the umm persuasion.)  I have a couple of more ideas for stories however I'm reluctant to start them b/c I already have quite a bit on my plate to take care of first. Maybe after I finish one of my stories I can start.</p><p>In other news I've caved in to the pressure and have re rolled Ranma's dragon form in Dragon's bane and I will be continuing it.</p><p>As always many thanks to my prereaders.</p><p>Lord Raa, Axekeeper, Chi Vayne, and KM</p><p>Without them you'd have to suffer through something written by a hack with bad grammer and an even worse sense of humour.</p>
