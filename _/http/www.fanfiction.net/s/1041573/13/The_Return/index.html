</div><p>The Return</p><p>A Ranma Sailor Moon fic thingy.</p><p>By Josh Temple</p><p>Naturally, I own neither Sailor Moon nor Ranma.  So here's the disclaimer</p><p>Ranma 1/2 and its characters and settings belong  to Rumiko Takahashi, Shogakukan, Kitty, and Viz Video. Bishoujo  Senshi Sailor Moon belongs to Naoko Takeuchi, Koudansha, TV Asahi,  and Toei Douga, and DIC.</p><p>Previous chapters and other works can be found  at my fanfiction website.</p><p>Other website Temple of Ranma's Senshi</p><p>C&amp;C as always is wanted.</p><p>Chapter 12 Revival and Renovation</p><p>Akane smiled. She could feel mother's presence. She had been saved  from that horrible monster that had taken her. She and her mother  would get revenge on the creature that had tried to change her. She  froze after she opened her eyes.</p><p>"You're absolutely right, Dear," Alexia grinned as she ran  a hand across the younger demon's cheek. Both of them were on a large  bed, but Alexia was leaning over the other demon.</p><p>"No..." Akane wanted to get up, to attack Alexia, to run,  to do something, but there was a... presence that was keeping her  from moving.</p><p>"Don't worry, mother's here and everything's going to be okay,"  Alexia reassured. "You're safe from the Traitor."</p><p>Akane whimpered as the presence in her mind increased. She could feel  it snaking around in her brain. She flared her eyes and growled as  she used every ounce of her will to lunge at Alexia. "Stop it!"</p><p>The blonde demon intercepted her and embraced the younger succubus.  "Are you done playing?" Alexia laughed as she watched the  hatred drain from the girl's face. She then reached up and gently  stroked one of the girl's horns.</p><p>"Please... just stop. I want my Mommy," she whined.</p><p>"You'll have her," Alexia gently said as she nudged the  girl.</p><p>"I will?" the teen asked as she leaned onto Alexia.</p><p>"I know it's painful, but I have to break the spell the Traitor  put on you. It was an awfully cruel trick she did to you."</p><p>"Trick?" Akane asked despair leaking into her voice. Her  wings dropped.</p><p>"Why yes, she made you think you were some weak human."  Alexia said as she removed her hand from the girl's horn and gently  hugged her.</p><p>"She tried to turn me into someone else?" The young demon  asked. "No! She didn't! She loved me! She was trying to help  me!" She tried to work up the resolve to fight it, but her  memories were fuzzy. Then suddenly one came into focus. She  remembered slapping a redhead away and crying about being controlled  and manipulated. It was clear in her mind what happened next. The  redhead had exerted her control and punished the younger succubus for  her impudence.</p><p>The teen's eyes hardened. "Yes, she did do that." Other  memories and slights of the redhead's were becoming clearer.</p><p>"It's okay," Alexia repeated. "You're with me now.  Mother's here for you, my dear Eclipse."</p><p>"Eclipse?" the young demon asked as she looked into  Alexia's eyes.</p><p>"Yes, that's the name you were born with. Don't you remember?"</p><p>"I..." the teenager paused trying to sort her memories  out. "I remember being shot," she whimpered again. "I'm  sorry I failed you." Tears started to from at the corners of her  eyes.</p><p>"I know. It's not your fault," Alexia said as she continued  to hug her spawn. "Don't worry, I'm setting things right."</p><p>The younger succubus nodded. "You're helping me aren't you?"  She could still feel the presence, mother's presence, in her mind,  but it was reassuring now.</p><p>"Yes, Eclipse. I'm peeling away the damage the Traitor did you.  It'll restore you back to your old self," Alexia promised. She  was very pleased with Eclipse's response. Unlike Aurora, this girl  already was Eclipse. She just needed to be reminded.</p><p>"Good," Eclipse purred as hate for the Traitor welled  within her. That human-loving redhead had tried to ruin her and it  had almost worked.</p><p>"Let's get you properly dressed," Alexia said as she led  Eclipse to the same set of mirrors that gave Aurora her first view of  herself.</p><p>Eclipse gave a seductive smile at her reflection. Long metallic blue  hair spilling down her back complimented her deep blue and  silver-gray wings and tail. She concentrated and shifted her clothing  to a pair of tiny leather shorts and a top that had less material  than the bras she used to wear. This style would do... for now.</p><p>The succubus laughed as she made her clothing vanish entirely. There  was no need for such human trappings here. "Thank you Mother.  Thank you for saving me," Eclipse said as she bowed before  Alexia, adoration and awe in her voice.</p><p>"Stand up," Alexia laughed, quite pleased with Eclipse's  respect.</p><p>Eclipse got back up, blushing slightly in embarrassment.</p><p>"Glad to have you back, Sis," Aurora smiled as she walked  over to her sister.</p><p>"Thanks for your help in saving me," Eclipse said as she  hugged the orange-haired succubus.</p><p>Alexia's smile soured when her daughters decoupled. The cord around  Aurora's neck was empty. "Where's your phone, Aurora? Did you  lose it again? There was a reason I told you to wear it around your  neck."</p><p>"I'm sorry mother. One of the Traitor's spawn stole it from me."  Aurora knelt as she gave her apology.</p><p>"That's not good," Eclipse said as she resumed preening in  front of that mirror. Her new hair color was quite appealing to her.</p><p>"Explain daughter," Alexia asked, her tone sweetening.</p><p>Eclipse smiled. "The humans working with the Traitor are rather  clever, in their own way. They will be able to find out all the  numbers Aurora has called. Maybe even their locations."</p><p>Despite her artificial tan, Aurora's face paled. "No..."</p><p>"This house is no longer safe," Alexia announced. She  sighed. This had been a comfortable lair, but thanks to Aurora's  incompetence it was useless.</p><p>Aurora wanted to ask why they weren't staying and fighting, but she  knew it was not her place.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>Communications and Cryptography agent Maya Iverson looked over the  cell phone that had been transferred to her and another Forensic  Pathology agent.</p><p>She frowned as she started to examine the cheap, pink phone. "At  the very least we can get some phone numbers from this thing,"  Maya said as she started accessing the call records. They were  surprisingly sparse. It looked like the phone was recently purchased.</p><p>"When you get the numbers see if you can get any locations from  them," Kasumi briskly said before turning back to Ranma.</p><p>The redhead was staring at the far wall of the mall shop as she  hugged her two children, who surprisingly enough were starting to  fall asleep.</p><p>"Uh... Red? We're getting some numbers. It looks like we've got  where Alexia lives." Kasumi paused, amazed that her statement  had not resulted in more than a slow nod from the succubus. "You  should come with us. We're organizing a rescue mission now."</p><p>Ranma blinked and got up, gently raising her kids with her. She  checked to make sure she and her remaining children looked passably  human before following Kasumi out of the mall and into a waiting  Company Van.</p><p>Kasumi watched her fiance as the vehicle drove to WIC Toronto-B.  Despite Ranma's human form it was abundantly clear that she was not  human. A powerful and angry predator was thinly contained just under  the surface.</p><p>"Mommy?" Nariko asked as she leaned onto her mother.</p><p>"Yes?" Ranma asked. She smiled slightly, but her eyes still  kept their distant look.</p><p>"We're going to get Akane back. Alexia deserves whatever you do  to her," Nariko said simply, her eyes glowing evenly.</p><p>"Yes," Ranma repeated, her voice disturbingly calm.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"What's wrong?" Ami asked as she watched her female friend  slump into her room. She noticed that Janet had not even removed her  school uniform.</p><p>"It's Mom," Janet sighed and loosened the knot on her tie.</p><p>Ami's eyes widened. "Does she know... I mean... about us?"</p><p>Janet gave a defeated shrug. "She notices that I'm up here a  lot, and our late night outings are starting to make her suspicious."</p><p>Ami nodded as she walked over to Janet. "There's no getting  around that. We have to do what we have to do."</p><p>"Sometimes I wish we were like Sunny and her family. Things  would be much easier. She doesn't have to hide what she is from her  parents."</p><p>"Don't worry," Ami said as she gently hugged the other  girl. "We'll get through this. Do you want to talk to Usagi  about it?"</p><p>Janet nodded. "Yeah, this concerns her. She's experienced this  before right? Hiding the truth from her parents?"</p><p>"Yeah, her parents are around more for her than the rest of us."  Ami's face soured briefly. At least she still had parents, unlike  Makoto or the late Mamoru.</p><p>"I'm not going to lose Mother. She's the only family I have,"  the adopted teen promised.</p><p>"You won't. We'll take care of everything," Ami reassured  as she broke their hug.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"I understand," Kasumi said into her cell phone. She then  turned to the other occupants of the vehicle. "They've tracked  down some of the locations in Aurora's phone. Frequently called is a  landline to a residence in Pine Gove, not far from that Alexia's  warehouse in Vaughan. It's a good-sized mansion. The owner is a  younger woman. I wouldn't be surprised if she sported horns now  though, or was connected to the fake company that owned Alexia's  other lairs."</p><p>"That figures," Ukyou noted. It made sense. Alexia could  find a rich woman or two and turn them into her minions. That would  give her plenty of resources for her plans.</p><p>Kasumi communicated with command a bit more. "So far, forward  observers haven't detected anything conclusive but they're not on  position yet. Regardless we're bringing in jamming equipment and  setting up a full quarantine anyway."</p><p>"Good." Ranma kept her eyes closed. She reached out to her  remaining daughters and kept them close.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>Eyes glowing, Ranma spread her wings and flexed her talons.</p><p>"It's a good thing this place is on an isolated property,"  Lt. Tendo remarked before organizing her men.</p><p>"I can feel that the jammers are up. I'm going in." Ranma  strode forward.</p><p>"But, can you feel her?"</p><p>"No, I don't. Just some fodder. Can your equipment pick her up?"</p><p>"We're getting the same on our scanners. Though she might be  able to fool them," Kasumi agreed</p><p>"I thought so." Ranma motioned to her kids and the trio  extended their wings and rushed the building.</p><p>Kasumi sighed and using her headset told command that the demons had  started. She then watched as a pair of armored vehicles broke from  the quarantine line and rammed the mansion. Their travel was  uncontested and two squads came out of the back of the vehicle and  secured the main foyer.</p><p>Lt Tendo and her team did not see this; they were in another vehicle  that was making a run at a side entrance. Several fireballs thudded  onto the roof. They flared harmlessly on the armor.  Coaxial-controlled machinegun fire from the APC hit the window where  the attack originated. It was joined by a guided-missile launched  from the quarantining troops.</p><p>The troop carrier stopped at the door and the ramp went down. The  team of agents breached the door and found nothing. "Reading  anything Gabe?" Kasumi asked as she went forward.</p><p>"I see a cluster of seven no... five... um... three Pattern D's.  One is a pattern silver. There might be one or two more down this  corridor and above us. I'm not sure."</p><p>"We'll go to the hallway just on the other side of this kitchen  and secure a choke point first," Kasumi said as she led her  troops down the room. The walk-in freezer and pantry were both  quickly examined. Their contents were unsurprising and ranged from  mundane to horrifying.</p><p>Their task was to rescue Akane and clear the building. The detailed  search and analysis of the contents of Alexia's lair would be the job  of Forensic Pathology Section. The team made its way down an  adjoining corridor and, after killing a succubus in a maid's uniform  with a single shot to the head, met up with a team that had breached  the front doors. They went up the stairwell and found an irate  redheaded succubus.</p><p>"You didn't find anything did you? The bitch just bolted. She  didn't even take her whole family. She left us to clean up her  trash..." the redhead's eyes narrowed.</p><p>"You didn't take any alive did you?" Kasumi asked. "They  might know-"</p><p>"They weren't told anything." Nariko frowned. Once Mother  ascertained that Alexia's minions were useless they were disposed of.  At least that part cheered her up slightly.</p><p>Ukyou nodded slowly. It was strange. Before, she wouldn't think twice  of killing such weak demons. Ones that were scared and abandoned by  their mistress. Now... it almost made her feel dirty.</p><p>"How did she know to leave?" Ranma demanded, as violet fire  flickered down her arms.</p><p>"She might have figured out what us having Aurora's cell phone  meant." Ukyou suggested.</p><p>"Fucking bitch!" Ranma summoned a fireball.</p><p>"No!" Kasumi said, careful to keep her weapon pointed away  from the succubus.</p><p>"Yeah, Mom. Alexia probably left important stuff written around  here. Other places she's been to, accounts she uses, things like  that," Ukyou said.</p><p>Ranma's eyes twitched.</p><p>"Calm down Mommy," Nariko said as she hugged the other  teen. "I want Akane back as much as you do but destroying this  place won't bring her back any faster."</p><p>Ranma returned the hug and her expression softened. "I know,  Honey." She turned to Kasumi. "I want a team of agents with  a powerful scanner thingy and a list of all the places you think  Alexia could be. And update me with <i>everything</i> you find out  here."</p><p>"You're giving orders?"</p><p>"I want Akane back, and I'm more than willing to use you guys to  do that."</p><p>"I just find it a bit strange. You moved from not trusting the  Company at all, to ordering agents around."</p><p>"It's that or I fly house to house all over town," Ranma  said before brushing past Kasumi.</p><p>The officer nodded. It was not a hard decision. Take orders from a  brood mother that made sense and would be sent for approval with  command anyway or let a demon work her way from one end of the city  to the other.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"I can't believe Aurora's incompetence cost us so dearly,"  Eclipse sniffed as she looked around the suite where Mother had taken  them.</p><p>"I said I was sorry," Aurora pouted.</p><p>"That's not good enough." Eclipse walked over to the other  succubus and glared. "I see why Mother saw it fit to bring me  back."</p><p>"You're forgetting mother had me rescue you," Aurora  countered.</p><p>"Which you screwed up!" Eclipse extended her claws.</p><p>"That's enough you two!" Alexia shouted. Her daughters  immediately stopped and bowed their heads. "Good, why don't you  two play with each other nicely while Mother thinks things over."</p><p>The two girls nodded and started practicing on their clothing and  hairstyles.</p><p>Looking out the window, Alexia planned her next move. Losing that  lair was a blow, but it was just a building and money, such things  were easily acquired. More importantly, she had her daughter back.</p><p>She could guess how much the Traitor was hurting from this. That  redheaded upstart was weakened and emotional now. Alexia considered  her resources. A plan formed in her mind. It was risky and it would  require some last-minute adjustments but either way it would work.</p><p>Alexia smirked. The Traitor would either lose outright and die or  lose another one of her beloved pawns.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>Ranma closed her eyes as she sat on the toilet. Her daughters, the  two that remained, could be felt outside the bathroom. She  concentrated and tried to control herself. She remembered what Alexia  did... and it seemed like a useful technique... if only to allow her  to regain some scant sanity. Their search had been fruitless. Most of  the places on their list had been dead ends. A few had a couple  clueless minion succubae but nothing more than that.</p><p>She could feel her emotions bubbling within her, occasionally forming  as ghostly waves of flames that danced over her. Her experiences as a  human and especially as a teenage boy were completely inadequate to  deal with the righteous, raw, vengeful rage that came from having her  child stolen from her.</p><p>Ranma had to get control back... she could feel it slipping away as  the phantom flames of white and purple pulsed faster. Her violent  urges had to be controlled, not stopped. She was going to devour  Alexia. Things had to be contained; so she could get to Alexia and  unleash them fully on her.</p><p>Sitting at a table near the bathroom, Ukyou and Nariko tilted their  heads as they felt mother's energy... diminish. Their connection to  her was still there, but the power that mother normally radiated had  been deadened.</p><p>The two girls went back to sampling their meals. "We should be  on base," Ukyou said as she sat in the darkened street in front  of miniature mall that contained the fast food establishment.</p><p>"We're hungry now, Sis. We spent all night looking. Besides once  Mommy's done we'll be back in the van. Those agents do want their  food." Nariko pouted. She felt she could almost feel Akane, but  she dismissed it as her longing. A part of her was missing and she  wanted it filled again.</p><p>"I'm worried," Ukyou's eyes traced back to the van parked  across the street. There was a fully armed squad in the vehicle, the  same one that had been providing direct support. They had been  assigned to them after they had cleared Alexia's former lair.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>A block away a trio of demons landed on a rooftop. The tallest  started scanning the nighttime cityscape. Her attention eventually  fell onto a specific building. She alerted her companions and they  began to watch the building. The two younger ones raised issues about  the black van's presence but the elder assured them that they were no  concern.</p><p>Alexia refocused her senses. She could not believe her luck. It was  too far for her to identify the scent of the succubae in that  building, but she knew there were around two young ones in that  building.</p><p>A building that was being watched by those meddling humans. Even if  the succubae inside the building were not members of the Traitor's  brood, they were still succubae. Ones that could be recruited to her  cause.</p><p>The important thing was that the Traitor was not here. Alexia  strained her senses to confirm it. The Traitor was irritatingly  powerful for such an insignificant upstart. Alexia smiled to her  daughters.</p><p>Both would have their chance to redeem themselves. Alexia watched her  daughters prepare themselves and fly off. She would be with them  shortly, there were just a few things she needed to do.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>A Communications and Cryptography agent noticed one of their flagged  phone numbers activate. The conversation was brief and seemingly  harmless. Institutional paranoia dictated that it was a code for  something.</p><p>The agent alerted his supervisor and a generic warning was dispensed  to the relevant units.</p><p>"That's just great," Lieutenant Patterson said when he  received word. He turned to his team "Al, Rich, I want you two  to get to those girls now," The agent looked out the back window  of the van then back at the pattern scanner. It showed the three  demons in the room but Sunshine's signal was... strange; it seemed  faded. Patterson's sensor specialist said it might have something to  do with interference from being a pattern silver too.</p><p>The two agents were just about to leave when a messy streak suddenly  arced across the scanner's screen.</p><p>"Shit," Patterson muttered. "Alert base, we're going  to need backup. Suit up, men."</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"Akane?" Nariko asked with worry crossing her face.</p><p>"Oh damn-it," Ukyou said as she looked around the  mini-mall.</p><p>"Hello girls," Aurora said as she strolled into the  mini-mall's lobby through the back door.</p><p>"Still wearing mall-rat grade crap I see," Ukyou sighed.  "You gonna try to take another one of us?"</p><p>Aurora laughed. "You always were perceptive Ucchan."</p><p>"She will make a fine addition," another teenage woman said  from behind Aurora. She had long metallic blue hair, and was wearing  leather hot pants and a bikini style top. Her eye makeup was overdone  and even accounting for the proximity to her tanned companion her  skin seemed much paler than normal for a succubus. The face was  familiar but the expression was alien. It was a crude parody of  Ukyou's sister.</p><p>"Akane..." Nariko's voice was despondent. She knew this was  what had to have happened to her. She had helped save Akane before,  and this time she was stronger.</p><p>"The name's Eclipse," the blue-haired demon corrected as  she slinked over to Nariko. "You two can give up now. Mother  would be so much better to you than the weakling of a demon you're  serving now." Eclipse reached out to caress Nariko but was  knocked over by a punch to the side of her head. She quickly fell to  the ground and was momentarily dazed</p><p>Eclipse snarled as she pulled herself up. "You'll pay for that,  bitch. I'll make sure of that."</p><p>"You have no idea what you morons walked into do you?"  Ukyou laughed.</p><p>Eclipse and Aurora's eyes widened. She was here. The Traitor had been  waiting for them.</p><p>Ranma charged into the lobby. She had gotten out as quickly as  possible. Her pants were the longest part, being something she could  not simply force through.</p><p>"Well... it's good that you're back Akane. Aurora, I'd like to  think that you returned my daughter out of some hope of mercy, but  I'm just happy that I can kill you now." Ranma's smile showed  her fangs but Aurora's attention was on the redhead's eyes.</p><p>"Saotome! Need any support!" Patterson said as his men  breached the lobby and took position.</p><p>"Let me think," Ranma said keeping her attention on the two  wayward demons. Aside from the agents, the only humans she could feel  were the staff to the fast food place, the only open shop in the mall  at this hour. It would be nice to have the agents take care of that,  but that would put them too close to Aurora... and Akane.</p><p>"Ucchan, get those humans outta here." Ranma did not want  to have to deal with protecting civilians or explaining to them what  happened. "Agents, cover us. Don't hit the blue-haired one that  bad though."</p><p>Ukyou nodded and ran into the restaurant. As a succubus she could be  quite persuasive, especially to a group of night shift fast food  workers. It did not require much in the way of fear pheromones or  physical damage to get them out the loading door in the back.</p><p>Ranma studied Akane's form. "At least you're not wearing a  bottle tan. Akane, you're gonna fight this, but that's okay. It's not  really you. In the end you'll thank me." The redhead's eyes  glowed softly and her claws started to slide out.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>From her perch, Alexia's eyes flared in anger. The Traitor was there  all along. The redhead had hid herself and had used her minions as  bait. Normally, Alexia would have been angry at falling for such an  obvious honey-pot. Her smile returned. It was fortunate that she had  planned on something like this happening. She vanished from sight  with one final glance at that building. It looked like she would have  to take care of things herself.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>The magical output from a teleport and a large use of demonic energy  was something that several powerful computer systems were tailored to  detect. One of which was already trained on the area and instrumental  in the sending in of troops to reinforce the area.</p><p>The other, a much smaller but much more advanced computer, had picked  up on the disturbance and had sounded a shrill alarm. However, the  computer's owner ignored the alarm. She had more important things on  her mind and in her hands.</p><p>The more primitive, but at this moment, more effective computer  system had shown a sudden shift in the number of demonic signals. The  technicians operating these computers knew what that meant and kept  their superiors updated on the situation.</p><p>Something that the operator of the other computer system was quite  remiss in.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"My name is Eclipse," the blue-haired demon spat. "It  was always Eclipse!" Fire flared around her and she shifted into  her true form.</p><p>Ranma's eyes, violet with streaks of blue, darted between the twisted  form of her daughter and that of Aurora. Elation filled her at the  knowledge that Akane was alive. Though she was depressed that Alexia  had warped her daughter, but Ranma expected that Alexia would do  something like this, but not that Alexia would work quite this fast.</p><p>She finally settled on the blue-haired demon's form. "Young  lady... we <i>are </i>going to talk about that nonsense you're  wearing."</p><p>"You're not my mother... You never were!" As Eclipse looked  into the Traitor's eyes she could almost feel her will being sapped.</p><p>"Honey, you've been brainwashed. You sound like you're in a bad  movie," Ranma's eyes flashed as she stepped forward. "I  wonder if you lost your fighting skills when you lost your fashion  sense." The redhead smirked slightly.</p><p>"How dare you! You won't harm me. You want your little slave of  a daughter back."</p><p>Ranma smiled thinly, and stepped forward. "Your sister shot you  three times just to save you. What do you think your mother will do?"</p><p>Seeing that their enemy's attention was distracted and irritated at  being ignored, Aurora extended her claws and tail filaments. She  folded her wings back and charged in to Ranma's side.</p><p>In a deceptively lazy motion Ranma's tail flicked over and up nearly  cutting off half of Aurora's tail before embedding into the  green-eyed girl's right hip. As that happened Ranma turned her arm  and, in a blur no one could track, captured Aurora by the wrist.  There was a brief battle between Aurora's green aura and Ranma's  violet but they ultimately canceled each other out.</p><p>The redhead then twisted the rival demon's arm, extended the  claw on her thumb, and ran it from Aurora's wrist to between her  middle and index finger.</p><p>Ranma swirled her tail with a degree of macabre panache and  ripped it out of Aurora's side. The ragged wound erupted in a crimson  fan. The droplets from the spray that landed on the redhead's lips  were quickly licked up.</p><p>"I've haven't forgotten you Ryoga, dear. You'll get your turn,"  Ranma laughed. A pair of narrow beams shot out of her eyes and sliced  through Aurora's legs.</p><p>The orange-haired demon had managed to dodge enough to prevent her  femurs from being cut, but there was enough muscle trauma to be a  problem. Not to mention the hole in her abdomen and the loss of her  right hand.</p><p>Eclipse's eyes glowed. Her sister had been hurt and the Traitor had  turned away from her. She focused onto the Traitor and came in with a  low kick...</p><p>... just as Aurora moved and pressed her own attack with the claws in  her still functional hand extended. Ranma saw both of them move and  stepped into Eclipse's attack</p><p>She caught Eclipse's leg and flung her right into her sister.  Panicked, Aurora was forced to adjust her attack. Instead of  decapitating Eclipse, her claws merely sliced through the demon's  hair.</p><p>"Sorry kiddo, I'll train you better once this is over, I  promise," Ranma said as she retracted the claws in one of her  hands and punched Akane in the jaw, resulting in a brittle crunch.</p><p>Nariko narrowed her eyes. This was much worse than what had happened  to Akane the last time Eclipse took control, but she trusted mother.  "Akane... just stay down," she whispered. It looked like  Mother's strength and will had beaten her lover's twisted hate.</p><p>"Monster!" Aurora cried as she held Eclipse's unconscious  form.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Please, I'm saving her. You've taken worse.  Remember Assemblyman?"</p><p>"Don't call me that!" Aurora snarled.</p><p>"Like you could stop me," Ranma shrugged. "Now get up  and fight. You've still got all your limbs. Heal your wounds and  fight! Where're your fireballs? Where's your eye beams? No glowing  sword?"</p><p>"Yeah Ryoga. Maybe you can stand and die with some shred of  honor." Ukyou added. "I mean you spent months talking about  what you were gonna do when you got Mom. Well, here she is."</p><p>Ranma sighed. "You know. Maybe I should just tell the Company  team watching us to kill you. I think it'd be fitting to have you  killed by humans. It's your choice."</p><p>"Ma'am?" Lt. Patterson asked as he kept the orange-haired  succubus targeted with his HOG. He had a clear shot... for now. But  if the demons started fighting again it would not last.</p><p>"Sir, something strange is happening!" Patterson's sensor  specialist shouted to Morrison as the display on his pattern scanner  changed.</p><p>"Oh good... she's finally showing her face," Ranma smiled.  She would be able to end this mess. She summoned her power and  quickly shifted her clothes.</p><p>Ukyou and Nariko stiffened slightly, though they kept their stances.  Mom was here and mommy was stronger than that monster.</p><p>Aurora smiled. Mother had arrived and she would personally kill the  Traitor.</p><p>"Not just going to stand by and lose <i>these</i> minions?"  Ranma taunted as Alexia's form crashed through a skylight in the  strip mall's lobby. The redhead looked the rival brood mother over  and smirked. "Somehow I hoped you'd be more impressive, but you  look just like what you are. A petty thief who has to steal  everything, even the home for her brood."</p><p>Alexia glared; it would be a pleasure to... correct this Traitorous  upstart. Her daughters had seemed to be able to hold their own... if  not for that redhead. She appraised the humans. There would be no  interference from them</p><p>They were in for a rude surprise. It had taken a lot of her energy  and had used the last reserves of her brood, but it was worth it.</p><p>"This is Green Team! We need a jamming team at our location  ASAP! Alexia has been spotted!" the Company officer requested  into his headset.</p><p>"It ends now, you human loving-" Alexia paused. The redhead  seemed to be whispering something under her breath. <i>Why isn't she  cowering in fear, and what is she wearing?</i> Alexia thought just  before the redhead's hands suddenly went horizontal.</p><p>The blonde brood mother's thoughts were cut short as an obsidian orb  slammed into her chest. It sent explosive shards racing through her  torso. Narrow fans of blood and bits of minced organs sprayed out of  her back.</p><p>Alexia blinked and saw that the redhead had closed the gap between  them. The blonde summoned a shield and put her power to repairing her  torn organs. "As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted.  Your human flunkies won't save you now."</p><p>"Wow... I didn't believe it when Akane said you looked like a  carrot, but there you are." Ranma laughed at the tanned succubus  as she folded her wings and went on the offensive.</p><p>"Fuck! Sir, we've gotta mess of incoming pattern D's!"  Morrison shouted.</p><p>"What direction?" Patterson asked.</p><p>"Um... everywhere sir. At least a few dozen. They'll be in the  building in no time." Unknown to the agents, Alexia had  teleported her minions to a staging area outside of range and then  ordered them to split up and approach the building from multiple  directions.</p><p>"Sir," Patterson said into his headset. "Alexia's  brought the remnants of her brood." He paused. "Yes Sir.  We'll hold things until you arrive." Patterson turned to his  team and roughly quoted Colonel "Chesty" Puller USMC. "Men,  the enemy's in front of us, behind us. We're flanked on both sides by  an enemy that outnumbers us over ten to one. They can't get away from  us now!"</p><p>The officer then turned to Ukyou and Nariko. "Would you two  girls mind covering our backs?"</p><p>"That and we'll take care of Aurora," Ukyou promised while  Nariko nodded.</p><p>"Good, come on men. Red can take care of herself. Stevenson take  point, we'll take the front entrance. Henderson, Morrison you take  the back," Patterson ordered.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>A Company agent fired down the length of the alleyway behind the  restaurant. A burst from his smaller barrel dropped a demon that  tried to land in the narrow passageway. He pulled a pair of grenades  off of his belt and lobbed them onto the roof of the building where  that demon had come from.</p><p>" Fred that's enough!" Agent Morrison shouted as he tapped  onto his comrade's shoulder.</p><p>"That got 'em mad!" Fredric Henderson agreed as he and  Morrison retreated to their position inside the building. "That  got a third of them... maybe," the soldier said as he looked at  his pattern scanner.</p><p>The door suddenly burst open as a swarm of succubae ran through the  opening and right into the agent's fire. If he had the time to think  it, Fredrick could almost pity the things. At this moment all he had  time to do was kill them.</p><p>20mm rounds made short work of the first wave. Then came a pair of  fireballs. One splashed just above Fredrick's helmet setting the  fabric on the outside of it on fire. The other hit square onto  Morrison's chest armor, knocking the agent over.</p><p>"Rich!" Fredrick cried as he fired the last round in his  20mm clip. It killed one succubus and maimed another, but another  pair slipped in after that. One was felled by a precise burst of  7.26mm to the head by Fredrick, but the other slipped by and pounced  onto Morrison. Fredrick had do deal with another group of succubae  that came through the door.</p><p>The succubus sunk one of her claws into the shoulder of the prone  human she straddled. The fire on his chest had already snuffed out  but she would make short work of him. Though whatever he was wearing  did prove tough for her flickering claws.</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock when she saw movement behind the human's  goggles. The human's arm then jerked and a bit of cold metal slid  across her neck. Then there was nothing.</p><p>The demon gasped and flailed, splattering blood onto the agent.  Despite this, Morrison flipped the demon off of his body. With his  right arm now free, he pulled out his sidearm and placed a pair of  fifty caliber rounds into her skull. He flicked the blood off of his  k-bar and slid it back into it's sheath.</p><p>His breathing ragged, he briefly looked down at the deep scorches in  his ceramic-composite chest-plate and the bleeding cuts in his  shoulder. He then turned to his partner. "You okay Fred?"</p><p>"Me? I'm not the one who a demon pounced on." Henderson  said as he put a new fresh 20mm magazine into his HOG</p><p>"Yeah, I've gotta thank whoever came up with this new armor we  got," Richard said as he flexed his shoulder and decided not to  switch guns. He would be better off to not try the HOG.</p><p>"Lieutenant, the delivery door's secure. What's the ETA on that  backup?" Henderson asked.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"Get back here!" Ukyou shouted as she dived after Aurora.  The orange-haired succubus was becoming a real pain. Ukyou could not  dish out damage like her mother, and Aurora was able to heal faster  than she got hurt.</p><p>Alexia looked at the reforming stump that was her right arm in  horror.</p><p>"Man... have you ever fought hand to hand?" Ranma said  before she took a bite out of Alexia's forearm. "Hmm... from  this soft muscle I'd say no."</p><p>Alexia snarled as she kept backing up. "You'll pay for defiling  my body!"</p><p>"This from a woman that coats herself in orange coconut sauce?  You're just begging to get eaten," the demonic senshi laughed as  she charged up and released another DarkStar Burst, knocking Alexia  into a wall.</p><p>Nariko was killing any demons that had slipped past the agents at the  doors, and was using her considerable spare time to watch her mate.  She was therefore the first to see what was going on. "Mommy!  Stop her!"</p><p>"What the?" Ukyou said as Aurora straightened up and shot a  fireball at her. She then swooped down to Eclipse whose eyes quickly  opened. Her jaw was still misshapen but she rapidly got to her feet.</p><p>"Mother?" the blue-haired succubus asked in a distorted  voice, her eyes trying for focus on Ranma's form.</p><p>Ranma turned to look at the demon, with a guarded look. Maybe she  knocked some sense into her.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Mom... Alexia... she was strong... she.." The  girl's speech, already mangled by the state of her jaw line,  degenerated in sobbing.</p><p>Ranma leapt over to her. "It's okay, Mommy's here," Ranma  comforted, before she was punched in the nose, which broke in a wet  crunch. The force from the impact knocked her over.</p><p>"Hah! I can't believe you think I'd turn against my mother so  easily," Eclipse taunted.</p><p>"Akane! No!" Nariko yelled as she swooped in.</p><p>"Don't you see! She broke my jaw. That proves she just wanted to  force me back when I was defenseless. Come with me, Alexia will let  you into the brood."</p><p>Ranma had spun around and swept Eclipse's feet out from under her and  then pounced onto the prone form. "You should have followed  through with your attack, instead of gloating." Her voice was  sad she should not be forced to do this, not to her own daughter, but  this was how things were.</p><p>Ranma was then hit by a pair of fireballs.</p><p>"Take your own advice," Alexia smirked. "Well done  daughter."</p><p>"Isn't it odd in the slightest that Ranma would be fooled like  that? You do think she just enslaved you," Ukyou asked while she  fought Aurora.</p><p>DarkStar pulled herself up. Deep purple flames surrounded her burned  body. Her eyes glowed angrily as she charged at the rival brood  mother.</p><p>Confidently, Alexia fired off some more fireballs that were simply  absorbed by the redhead's fire. Anger clouded her expression which  was then mangled by a pair of purple beams that were only partially  reduced by her own aura.</p><p>Alexia recovered, turned, and ran to her daughters. She grimaced when  she felt a pair of claws and fingers sink into the bones of her wings  and hold fast. With a scream Alexia flipped her tail up and severed  her wings where they joined her back. If she had more time and energy  she would have made them vanish, but things were dire. She had to get  out.</p><p>Eclipse looked at her... mate and sniffed. "I'm sorry... mother  needs me," she said before Alexia grabbed her with her remaining  arm. Aurora leapt down and hugged her mother.</p><p>"No you don't!" Ranma snarled as she dropped Alexia's wings  and rushed in. She grabbed Alexia's other hand and snapped the  forearm trying to pry the appendage off of her daughter.</p><p>"Aurora cut it!" Alexia ordered.</p><p>Aurora nodded and used a claw to slice her mother's hand off. Alexia  screamed, but the Traitor was no longer attached to her and she was  finally able to escape. With hardly enough energy, she teleported  away.</p><p>Due to the sudden release, Ranma tumbled back. As she watched her  daughter get stolen from her again the demon formed a fist, crushing  Alexia's fingers. She blinked and could suddenly hear the steady  bursts of gunfire. She could also sense a handful of other demons.</p><p>"Not again! Not again!" Ranma chanted as she kept crushing  Alexia's arm. She slowly stood, separated the appendage and gave the  halves to her children.</p><p>"Come on Mom, let's see how those agents are doing," Ukyou  delicately said as she led Ranma to the back of the building.</p><p>"Yeah, we've got some agents to save," Ranma admitted. As  the three succubae approached the nearest exit, the gunfire suddenly  stopped.</p><p>"Heya Red, how'd things go for you?" Henderson asked as he  turned from his position behind a mound of succubae corpses that had  massed near the door.</p><p>"I don't see anyone else back here. I think that's the last of  it. Good thing we got the bottom of the barrel," Richard added  as he looked over the scanner before carefully checking down the  alleyway.</p><p>There was the sound of gunfire before that of boots hitting the roof  as a squad of agents rappelled down from a helicopter. The Company  Blackhawk's door guns quickly dispatched the straggler and leftover  demons. After that a team had rappelled down and secured the roof.</p><p>Ranma looked at the dead succubae. Naturally, they all had gunshot  wounds, but one had something else. "Who knifed this one?"  she asked looking at the demon with the slit throat and not much  above the jaw.</p><p>"That was me, Ma'am." Morrison said as he exchanged hand  signals with the reinforcing agents. "I got hit by a fireball  and that thing pounced right on me and it was the fastest thing I  could draw."</p><p>"Impressive." Ranma nodded. "About fucking time,"  she grumbled as she felt a WIC jamming equipment enter the area. "You  guys are too late!"</p><p>"Ma'am?" Morrison asked. He looked away briefly. The  succubus' form unnerved him. The blood and gore on her were normal,  but the healing wounds that dotted her form and the torn uniform were  distracting.</p><p>"Not you. You guys held on. Though I'd look at your shoulder.  It's these other guys that came in late..." She glared at the  fresh Company troopers that had arrived on scene.</p><p>"About time you got here, Jarvis," Ranma stated.</p><p>"Sorry for the delay," the officer replied. His tone  sounded sincere, but his features were obscured by his balaclava.</p><p>"I won't lose her again."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Nariko and Ukyou flanked their mother and tried to keep even  expressions.</p><p>Ranma looked to see a medic start to work on Morrison's wounds. "How  did the other guys make out?"</p><p>"Agent Stevenson's being evacuated by helicopter right now. He  might lose that leg."</p><p>"Will he live?"</p><p>"Most likely, unless there are complications."</p><p>"Good." The succubus made a note to meet this Stevenson as  soon as possible. She added another name to the list as she watched a  bandaged Morrison make his way towards the front of the building. The  agent had retrieved his rifle and had removed his goggles and slid  down his facemask.</p><p>"Is that our food?" Morrison asked as he looked at the bags  scattered across the lobby. He knelt down and felt one of the bags.  It still had a tiny bit of heat. The agent glanced at his watch. It  had been less than ten minutes. "Quick."</p><p>"It always feels longer," Ukyou mumbled. Her attention went  from the spilled food to the carnage that surrounded her. Her  Assembly experience deadened her to the smears and streaks of blood,  the bullet holes and scorch marks, and even the torn bodies and  scattered limbs. At least the fact that she found the charnel tableau  appetizing still disturbed her, but she had missed her meal.</p><p>She remembered happily eating Alexia's arm with her sister. The  blonde's nose was filled with the aromas of the room, many of them  quite enticing. If the agents were not here she would consider having  more to eat, but she was still a bit self-conscious.</p><p>Her eyes widened when she saw her mother flick out a claw,  disembowel, and cut out some liver from a nearby corpse. Ukyou should  have known better. They were all injured and could use some more  energy, and eating their kills was the normal for them.</p><p>"I suppose Forensic Pathology doesn't need yet another complete  succubus cadaver. Perhaps we would freeze the choice cuts after  autopsy," Jarvis remarked dryly.</p><p>"Not a bad idea," Ranma allowed as she sectioned the organ  and feed some to her kids. "But I don't want you guys to be our  personal butchers." She cracked open a ribcage and deftly  removed the heart. "Also these things are so much better when  they're fresh."</p><p>"I see," Jarvis remarked. He looked to see a pair of large  wings that were not attached to anything. "Do those belong to  Alexia?" the agent ventured.</p><p>"Yeah, the bitch was more than willing to cut herself up to  escape." Ranma growled. while taking a bite. She then noticed  the reactions of the men around her. "Wow, you guys seem to  taking our little snack fairly well," Ranma remarked as she  hugged Nariko, who was munching on a piece of heart.</p><p>The captain looked to see that his men were avoiding looking at what  the demons were eating while keeping their hands a bit closer to  their guns. "We are experienced in this," he replied, as  usual, maintaining full eye contact with her.</p><p>"How often do you see us eat?" Ranma asked after she  finished chewing.</p><p>"I've seen more disturbing," Jarvis said, though that was  before he had joined the Company.</p><p>"So did you guys get a trace on where they went? Or maybe you  got another lead on Alexia's hiding places?"</p><p>"Somewhat, though if I may make a suggestion," Jarvis  offered.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Go home, talk to Major Saotome, Lt. Tendo, her other sister.  Get some rest. I know you want your child back, but you look a bit...  manic. Even for a demon."</p><p>Ranma's eyes narrowed and she gritted her teeth. Sometimes she really  hated Jarvis' ability to stare her down. They both knew what she  could do to him but that did not stop him from talking to her like  this.</p><p>"How can I go home, and walk into that house without their  sister?"</p><p>"It's your choice, but you have a family that loves you and  supports you," Jarvis's eyes looked wistful. "Take  advantage of that. At the very least, sleep when you get fatigued.  Even your kind needs sleep."</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>Eclipse frowned at her shortened hair. It was the only damage left.  Her face had healed but the hair was still ruined.</p><p>"I'm so sorry sister. The Traitor tricked me and-" Aurora's  apology was cut short as the other demon spun around and jabbed her  fist into Aurora's side. The orange-haired succubus gasped as the hit  opened up barely healed wounds the Traitor had given her.</p><p>"I don't need your excuses. I was there," Eclipse snarled.  Unlike Aurora, the Traitor had avoided killing blows on her, but the  redhead has still wounded her. They had fought well against the  Traitor's spawn, but then <i>she</i> arrived and they were forced to  withdraw. If mother had not been there to allow them to escape...</p><p>Eclipse snarled. She did not want to consider that possibility.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Aurora bowed as she held her side.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm sure you are," Eclipse smiled. She then returned  to the mirror and looked at her ragged hair. "Perhaps a style  change was in order. Long hair did remind me of... her." The  demon's eyes narrowed in remembrance of a life that was all lies.</p><p>"Hmm... let me see first," Aurora said. She was curious who  her sister was talking about, but knew she could not ask.</p><p>Eclipse eyed her tanned sister's teased, permed hair, and slinky  evening wear. "I'm not exactly your style."</p><p>"I know," Aurora reassured. "I've been thinking about  something that matches your personality."</p><p>"It could help my hunting," Eclipse allowed. It had annoyed  her that her little sister was more proficient at enticing and  harvesting humans than she was. Though in all fairness, Eclipse did  just have one night of hunting under her belt. It was another thing  the Traitor had ruined for her.</p><p>"Don't worry sis, " Aurora said as she led Eclipse over to  her makeup table. "If you don't like it we can undo it."</p><p>"What are you girls up to?" Alexia entered the room her two  daughters shared.</p><p>Eclipse and Aurora fell silent and bowed their heads towards their  mother. They had already been punished for their failure, and they  knew they were still on thin ice. Neither really minded the first  half of their punishment. It was an honor to serve mother until she  regenerated from the damage she had taken to protect them, though the  forced abstinence was incredibly cruel.</p><p>"I was going to give Eclipse a makeover," Aurora quietly  said.</p><p>"Oh wonderful," Alexia smiled warmly. That fight had been  sobering. The traitorous bitch had actually <i>hurt</i> her. The  thought of that redhead devouring her arms sickened her. It was clear  that merely sending her children to fight for her was not enough. She  was essentially out of minions too. It would take time until she was  ready to make her next attack. It would also take more sessions with  Eclipse. That girl knew much about the traitor and some of the things  could be... useful, but she had to be careful she did not want to  probe too deeply into those memories.</p><p>"I do regret that you failed to ask me for my advice," the  blonde pouted while</p><p>flexing her recently regrown hands. Her current  plans were not working. Something more had to be done. She smiled  warmly at her daughters and left them again. She might as well let  them have their bit of fun</p><p>"I would love to have your help," Eclipse said in a forced  happy voice. She was a bit worried as to what her sister would come  up with, but if things got out of hand mother would make everything  better.</p><p>'Trust me," Aurora smiled as she started to work. A half hour  later she had finished and let Eclipse to a mirror. It was largely  for presentation. Eclipse was an integral part in generating her  accessories and borrowing the jewelry from Alexia's supply.</p><p>"Wow... you really did a good job," Eclipse cooed as she  looked over herself. She was wearing her slightly more elaborately  detailed and embellished black hot pants and micro-top, but they were  just the under-base. She was wearing stylish platform boots with a  heel that helped her tower over Aurora.</p><p>Her short hair had been gelled, shaped, and spiked at the ends. Her  eyes were heavily made up with heavy black eye-liner, mascara, blue  eyeshadow that almost went to her temples, tiny arched eyebrows, and  long, intense eyelashes. Her cheeks had been powdered to a pallor  that somehow was pale even for a succubus. Black lipstick adorned her  lips and matched the black talons her nails were shaped into.</p><p>Her ears had extra piercings added to them that were filled with  alternating hoop and dangling earrings with gemstones. Her belly  button had been pierced and had a stone in it that Aurora had  convinced Eclipse was not too gaudy. The chain anklets, silver  bracelets, and satin choker seemed like a bit much, but they did look  good on her.</p><p>Eclipse drew the line at the tiara. Though it was fun to wear it in  private when it was just the family. "You might not be so  useless after all," Eclipse complimented as she rubbed one of  Aurora's horns.</p><p>"I know how much your mate laughing at your clothing hurt you  and I wanted to do something about it," Aurora said after she  finished purring. "Especially, after you showed me and mother  how I had damaged things." The hardest part for Aurora was  keeping a straight face. Though she doubted Eclipse would have  noticed. She was too busy preening in the mirror. The best part was  that her <i>big sister</i> actually liked her new look.</p><p>"I hope mother will have us rescue her next," Eclipse  sighed as she looked at her reflection.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"What do you think you're doing?" Major Saotome inquired as  she blocked her daughter's progress. The Saotome women were in one of  the corridors of the subterranean WIC Toronto-A base.</p><p>"I wanna go back out. Akane needs me... Alexia..." Ranma's  eyes flared angrily. "That bitch ruined my daughter."</p><p>"I know. Captain Jarvis told me about it."</p><p>"Then why did you order me back here? I thought you guys had  something. A lead on where they were hiding," Ranma asked, the  glow in her eyes flickering.</p><p>"We're going over what we found in Alexia's mansion. We will get  something. She's too flashy of a demon to stay hidden for long. Hell,  she just tried to attack you."</p><p>"More reason for me to go back out there."</p><p>"No."</p><p>Ranma looked to see that Nodoka was looking her in the eyes. Unlike  when Jacob or Jarvis did it the redhead lowered her own gaze.  "Mother... I'm going back out there."</p><p>"No, you're not." Major Saotome carefully stated. "You're  going to get some sleep." Nodoka reached out and grabbed her  daughter's arm.</p><p>"Uh... " Ranma looked down at her wrist, the grip was light  but substantial. She could just walk out, but that would be going  against Mother. The young succubus bowed her head. "Please..."</p><p>"You need rest." Nodoka said as she looked at her daughter.  The succubus' skin was not it's normal alabaster pale. It was tinged  gray and her eyes were less focused. "You can go right back out  in the morning."</p><p>"Yes mother," Ranma said as she clutched onto her mother.</p><p>"Wow, so that's what we're like," Ukyou mumbled to her  sister.</p><p>"It's cute, Mommy really loves grandma," Nariko said as she  and Ukyou followed their Mother and grandmother.</p><p>Nodoka put her arm around her daughter who was trying to burry her  head into her mother's side. "It's okay, Honey."</p><p>"I... I have to be strong, I have to get her back." Ranma's  voice hitched as she started to sob onto her mother.</p><p>"I know dear. I know," Nodoka soothed. She then felt Nariko  and Ukyou join in and start to comfort their mother. Nodoka smiled at  the warmth and ran her hand through her daughter's hair. In the  middle of a group hug, the officer led her family to her office and  lab where a couch with a folding bed had been moved in.</p><p>The officer's eyes raised as she watched the succubae strip. She had  somehow forgotten that part of how they worked. "You're sleeping  with us? Right Mom?" Ranma asked when she was down to just her  bra and underwear.</p><p>"Of course, Honey." Nodoka said. She could not say no to  that expectant and scared face. Her daughter might be a lethal  demonic cannibal, but Ranma was still her little... girl.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"You let her use your couch," Stillwater stated to Jacob as  the two watched the Saotome family fall asleep. The commander looked  to the bare spot in Jacob's office where the couch normally was.</p><p>"It was the only hide-a-bed on base. Aside from yours, Sir."  Jacob smiled.</p><p>"Good initiative. I am impressed by what the Major is willing to  do for family."</p><p>"Indeed. We can also see where Miss Saotome gets her figure  from," Jacob said as he turned off the monitor. It was still  being recorded of course. And they were being watched by the  surveillance teams, as were the agents guarding the door.</p><p>"I see Miss Saotome was more than willing to... make use of our  resources. It appears that your plan is working." Stillwater's  tone was cautious.</p><p>"Miss Saotome is irreplaceable. If we betray her trust we'll  never regain it, but-" Jacob smiled. "-if we maintain it.  We gain something very useful."</p><p>"I hope your optimism in her part during the tasks ahead is not  misplaced."</p><p>"She is a pattern Silver that has proven herself resourceful,  strong, and willing to work with us. Once this Alexia mess is cleared  up we can move forward. She has been a costly distraction."</p><p>"One that has forced changes in Miss Saotome however."  Stillwater scanned through Ranma Saotome's file. "It's  cumulative. Every battle she fights... "</p><p>"You're not worried about those eyes are you? We have plans in  place. Besides every indication we have shows her brood is getting  closer to us. Having them mix with our agents has been quite  successful. "</p><p>"Aren't you worried about things being too successful?"</p><p>"There's no such thing," Jacob stated.</p><p>Stillwater paused to think. "I want increased surveillance on  Miss Saotome. The pressure she's under now is immense."</p><p>"That should be easy enough. Since her daughter's abduction she  hasn't been more than a hundred feet from an agent."</p><p>"Good. Moving on." Stillwater took a sip from his mug. "Has  there been any progress on that potential leak?"</p><p>"Jarvis has eliminated several agents and associates who knew  enough to be a risk, but today's events have delayed his  investigation." Jacob said as he displayed a new file on his  computer.</p><p>The senior officer frowned at the report. "I want an independent  investigation on Jarvis too," Stillwater ordered.</p><p>Jacob blinked "Yes, I'll contact Command and have someone sent  in. Sir, do you suspect him?"</p><p>"No. If I did I would handle it personally, but we can't leave  things to chance. We are trusting him with a great deal of  responsibility."</p><p>"He has been an exemplary agent, family history aside."</p><p>Stillwater chucked. "That actually relieves me. A man with  skeletons in his closet is less suspicious than one who's record is  lily-white."</p><p>Jacob nodded. He was aware of Jarvis' feelings and knew where the  man's loyalties lay. "You are aware that such an independent  investigation would look into our own actions?"</p><p>"I fully expect that, and they should. The importance of our  work warrants it."</p><p>"Maybe General Anderson should just come for an inspection,"  Jacob sighed.</p><p>"Now, that's a bit harsh," Stillwater laughed. "We  need verification of ourselves and our officers not what he'd put us  through.</p><p>"True." Jacob said as he scratched the scar on his hand.  "In other news we're running down the records that we found in  Alexia's mansion. It looks like the heiress who officially owned the  building, who we found turned into a succubus and wearing a maid's  uniform, had a fair number of holdings.</p><p>"Most of them we've cleared and we're running down the last few.  Though if Alexia goes to ground she can just mesmerize or turn some  homeowner and live there."</p><p>"She's not going to hide. She'll lick her wounds and maybe  rebuild her forces but she wants Miss Saotome. Alexia will attack  again."</p><p>"Alexia was eager to attack tonight. I guess she wanted to show  off her new toy." Jacob took a long pull from his mug.  "According to Green Team, Alexia only escaped by cutting off  parts of her own body."</p><p>"Reminds you of the good old days doesn't it?" Stillwater  smiled.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"Well Nabiki, you're not making demands on when we'll get Akane  back? You're not asking for an update" Kasumi asked as the  remaining Tendo girls walked down an aisle in the grocery store.</p><p>"Would it accomplish anything? She's been gone for over three  days. I know what happened when she was gone for a couple hours,"  Nabiki turned to eye the agent who stood back and watched their  movements.</p><p>"We're doing the best we can. I mean Ranma's-"</p><p>"-crawling up the walls. I didn't really believe she was a  mother. Not until I saw..." Nabiki trailed off as she looked at  a cereal box.</p><p>"Ranma gave up her humanity and her manhood for them. She won't  fail," Kasumi replied.</p><p>Nabiki looked at her sister critically. It was clear as day now that  gentle, distanced Kasumi was a killer. Naturally, it was her eyes.  Nabiki turned and looked at the pair of agents that were following  them. Gabriel still looked awkward and geeky, but Nabiki knew it was  all a lie. It had to be. The female agent that was next to him was  unfamiliar to Nabiki.</p><p>"I know it's hard. I know what it's like to have your world  turned upside down, but you have to be strong," Kasumi offered.</p><p>"We can't all be good little soldiers. Some of us are normal,"  Nabiki snapped back. She noted the slight smile that formed on  Gabriel's face.</p><p>"At least you're not avoiding your protective detail,"  Kasumi allowed.</p><p>"I'm not a moron, sis." Nabiki sighed. "I can't stop  you guys."</p><p>"But you did demand that it be reduced."</p><p>"I want to have something of a normal life. It's not like I'm a  real target. They don't care about me. It's Ranma or her family,  people that are close to her. I'll just take the minimum. Besides,  every agent watching me is one less that's looking for Akane."  Her gaze hardened and she laughed bitterly. "Though Dad and Mr.  Saotome are clueless. You guys can keep them supplied with food and  booze and they'll happily stay in the house."</p><p>"Yes, they're happy being waited on. They don't demand to go out  and shop."</p><p>"I know bad stuff's going on but they're not really after me.  You don't have to sugarcoat all this. I could handle this."</p><p>"Honestly? You've only seen one side of this," the officer  stated.</p><p>"If you say so," Nabiki dismissed. She wondered what Kasumi  was planning. There had to be more to this. Kasumi was busy. Why was  she here?</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>"What? Fine. I'm fine." Nabiki looked to the front of the  store. "Everything's okay."</p><p>"No, it's not." Kasumi said as she drew her sidearm with  one hand and pulled out her phone with the other.</p><p>"Huh?" Nabiki asked as she watched an orange-haired young  woman walk into the store. She was elegantly dressed and had a nice,  if slightly suspicious, tan.</p><p>"Gabe! Get Nabiki out of here! Now!" Kasumi ordered as she  and Sophie fired their guns.</p><p>Aurora smirked as the bullets impacted her flaming aura. The green  flames glowed brightly and blocked them both. The grin reduced when  another round was fired, and another.</p><p>She gritted her teeth as the strain on her aura increased. It was  getting harder to generate enough power to shield it. The demon leapt  to the side and tried to flank the agents.</p><p>Aurora almost grinned at the respite, but was then knocked down by a  sequence of carefully aimed shots at her chest. She almost made it.  However the barrage was just too much. Most of the rounds made it  through the weakened barrier. The momentums of the bullets were  greatly reduced. Though there was still enough damage to put the  succubus down.</p><p>Kasumi frowned. She would have preferred to hit her in the head but  she did not want to miss. The agent strode forward.</p><p>Aurora looked at the mess that was her abdominal cavity and smiled.  She could feel her organs healing already. "You really think I  came alone, human? This is all going to plan," she stalled.  Eclipse should come in any minute and take her out.</p><p>The officer heard a young woman scream. "Sophie, go support the  others, I'll be done here soon enough," Kasumi ordered as she  increased the pressure on the trigger. She shot her last round into  the demon's head and then did something she had never done before.</p><p>Kasumi turned, reloaded, and ran in the direction of her sister's  scream, all without making sure that the demon was not regenerating  the wound, or exactly where the wound was.</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>Nabiki felt herself being pushed by a strong arm.</p><p>"Move it!" Gabriel shouted as he led her to the back exit.  His sidearm was out and he was shouting the situation back to base.   "Davenport! Bring the van to the North side of the  building! I'm evacuating a civilian!" Gabriel  shouted into his radio.</p><p>"Okay, okay," Nabiki said as they went through a stockroom.  It was easier to go with the flow than question the man with the gun.</p><p>"Turn here!" Gabriel hardly had time to think about the  lieutenant's orders. He should have stayed with her. Unless the  lieutenant thought that more Pattern D's were coming. In that case it  was still... questionable, but Command's orders confirmed things. He  was to get Nabiki out of the combat zone and to safety immediately.</p><p>Gabriel opened a side door and checked to see if it was clear.  Gabriel spotted the company van idling a dozen feet away, with a  combat-ready agent at the wheel. A delivery truck had prevented  Davenport from pulling up right next to the curb. He then shoved the  teenage girl and ran with her to the vehicle.</p><p>As Nabiki ran to across the pavement she felt a surge of wind on her  back and felt the other agent's hand slip out of her grip. She looked  down to see Gabriel's body sprawled on the ground, and crouching on  his back was a garish Goth girl. It took Nabiki a moment to see  through the heavy makeup and spiked-hair, not to mention past the  large wings and tail. "Akane..."</p><p>"I don't see what Aurora's problem is with these guys,"  Eclipse snorted, as she dug her heel into the human she had landed  on. It was not terribly hard to land on one while delivering a blow  to another. She turned to see that the driver of the van had pulled  out a gun and was raising it. Eclipse quickly formed a small  fireball and launched it into the side window.</p><p>The orb shattered on the window and broke into globs of napalm that  stuck to the interior of the van and Davenport. His armor and  goggles protected him but he was unable to make out anything.</p><p>"What did they do to you?" Nabiki asked as she backed  away... away from the demon and the burning person "God... just  look at you. I liked you better when you were a nudist."</p><p>"You'll regret saying that." Eclipse narrowed her eyes and  stepped off the unconscious agent.</p><p>Nabiki looked at the jeweled demoness for a split second before  turning and running to the burning van.. It was a futile effort.  Eclipse easily caught up to her and Nabiki screamed as the demon  pounced on her.</p><p>"I was planning on helping Aurora get the Traitor's little  girlfriend, but you'll do," Eclipse smiled as she ran a finger  across Nabiki's chin, and studied the human.</p><p>"I'm your sister!" Nabiki said, trying to regain her will.</p><p>Eclipse chuckled. "Not yet, but soon."</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>Jarvis frowned as he watched a medic look over Agents Gabriel Smith  and Robert Davenport. Smith was lucky that he only had as little  damage as he did, and Davenport was lucky that he had been able to  use the van's fire extinguisher as fast as he did and had the  foresight to slip on his armor beforehand. His attention returned to  Lt. Tendo who was standing before him. She had explained the  situation, not just to him, but to Colonel Edwards.</p><p>The captain made a few more inquiries. It was frustrating that Aurora  had gotten away, and that Public Relations section now had do deal  with the shoppers and staff that had seen a glowing woman get shot  repeatedly and get back up.</p><p>It was Sophie who confirmed that Nabiki was taken by Eclipse. She had  arrived just in time to see Nabiki being carried over a nearby  rooftop off by the winged demon.</p><p>"Aurora was a former Assembly acolyte. An acolyte with superior  regenerative abilities. I should have finished her but I felt that  aiding Nabiki and Specialist Smith was more urgent," Kasumi  admitted.</p><p>"However, <i>Eclipse</i> had already made off with her."  Jarvis allowed himself to sigh. Nabiki had requested less agents  surrounding her. Her reasoning was approved by command, however  Eclipse was still on the loose and Nabiki was now taken.</p><p>This was why the Company normally separated agents from their  families when they were on duty. It made for complications. In  Willard International Consulting's long history situations of this  nature had taken place before.</p><p>There was training for this, but it was easier to simply kill a  possessed or turned family member than what the lieutenant had to  deal with. Jarvis suspected that tonight's incident would shortly  become another field example for young recruits to be trained on.</p><p>The captain brought his expression back to its normally adamantine  rigidity. Lt. Tendo could not see him look amused, especially not at  this. He could sympathize with her. One by one, she was losing her  family. At least she still had some hope of getting them back.</p><p>"Sir?" Kasumi inquired.</p><p>"The men will get the same orders about Nabiki as they did  Akane," Jarvis briskly replied. He put his hand on her shoulder.  "We will get them back Lieutenant. The Company takes care of its  family."</p><p>1234567890987654321</p><p>"We have found them," a pale man said as he showed his  companion the image capture. It was a blurry shot but they could make  out enough details to make the twilight photo seem viable. Neither  was an expert in photo manipulation, but they had some practice. The  relevant area of the shot was cropped, zoomed in and the contrast was  increased.</p><p>It was pixilated and the face was hidden in shadows but they cared  about the uniform. The shoulder pads on the uniform were different,  but the skirt, collar and bows were unmistakable.</p><p>"When and where was this taken?" the elder inquired. Just  after they had gotten their logistics in order and were ready to move  their operations, their quarry had vanished. Everyone suspected a  leak... or a more sinister form of surveillance. After a shakedown in  the organization their efforts were redirected to finding their  quarry again.</p><p>"About a week ago and... in Canada, Toronto." The man  leaned back in his chair. "What the hell are they doing there?  The prophecy has their rule elsewhere." He specifically avoided  names. Names had power; names drew unwarranted attention.</p><p>The elder stroked his beard. "There had been rumors speculating  around that area."</p><p>"The collaborators?" the pale man whispered. They were  almost as bad as the prophesized ones. "But, they only care  about..."</p><p>"They care about continuing their own power. And they'll work  with anyone that will ensure that. They are no different from that  collection of false priests." The man absently rubbed his neck.  Once long ago, before the Master had saved him, he had been lost, but  now he was on the Path of the Will.</p><p>"But the prophesized world has no place for their kind."</p><p>The elder-man smirked. "Of course. No doubt the collaborators  think they are doing what they have always done. Dividing those that  prey on humanity against each other."</p><p>"Perhaps they plan to use them and destroy them."</p><p>"I would not like to trust the fate of the world to people such  as that. I am sure that in reality it is the collaborators that are  the ones being used."</p><p>"The prophecy does say that the rule of purity can be  defeated."</p><p>"Yes. 'And there will arise a weakness in distant lands. If the  will exists to use innocence as a lance then the new moon will set.'  "</p><p>"We always assumed distant lands referred to where they would  takeover..." The younger looked back to the screen. Despite it  being a blurry image, he found it hard to look away. "We must  tell the Master, he will know what to do, and when to act."</p><p>Nabiki groaned as she was dumped before a tall blonde succubus. "So  you're Alexia," she managed before the demon's green eyes locked  onto her.</p><p>"You're perceptive at least," Alexia smiled. "It seems  that you managed to get something useful out of Aurora's failure."</p><p>"Thank you, Mother," Eclipse beamed. "At least my dear  sister was still alive. Though when I found her, the poor thing was  delirious and stumbling."</p><p>"I was shot in the head," Aurora replied as she fluffed her  hair. It was a small miracle that the bullet was offset just enough  to allow her brain to stay largely intact. "But thank you  sister. I did need your help. It was rash of me to think that I could  take that human alone." Aurora bowed her head.</p><p>"It's okay," Eclipse smiled as she rubbed her sister's  horns. "You now know what happens when you're left to your own  devices. Don't worry. I'll be the one in charge now."</p><p>Nabiki frowned as she watched her sister dominate and pleasure a  purring demon. "Of course. I wasn't even the target. You wanted  Kasumi," the brunette clenched her fists. "That redheaded  slut comes here and everything falls apart. It's not enough that I  lose my sisters to her. No, I get pushed to the side."</p><p>"Are you through, human?" Eclipse inquired. "You  should be grateful that I brought you before Mother, instead of just  ripping you open."</p><p>"That's enough dramatics." Alexia dismissively waved. "From  both of you." She inspected Nabiki. At first she tried to resist  the demon's touching, but she found herself rapidly overpowered both  physically and mentally.</p><p>"Not a bad find, Eclipse. She has... potential." Alexia  turned back to Nabiki and pouted. "You're right to feel  bitterness against that redhead. Don't worry, you'll get your chance  against her," she whispered as she sunk her teeth into the  human.</p><p>"How are you holding up?" Ranma asked her fiancee.</p><p>"I've lost both my sisters, how do you think?" Kasumi said  before returning to the reports she was reading. The mansion had been  cataloged and almost all of the leads from it had been run down. They  were running out of places to search.</p><p>Ranma sighed. It was easier to comfort Ukyou and Nariko. She could  just hug them and listen as they poured their hearts out. With  Kasumi, the redhead did not want to risk touching her. The agent  probably could not handle that. She also refused to talk about it.</p><p>"We could go back to base. Would you want to talk to my mom?"  Ranma offered. It was a hassle to visit sometimes but Ranma was  relieved that her mother had not left that facility since Akane was  taken.</p><p>Ranma was... unsure of how she would handle losing Nodoka, or another  one of her kids.</p><p>"No, I'm fine."</p><p>"You're not. I know. I see my own grief in you." Ranma  leaned a bit closer to Kasumi.</p><p>"I can't stand it. I lost Nabiki and I can't even save her. Not  in the end." Kasumi's hand flexed. "In the end you're the  only one that can save her."</p><p>Ranma nodded slowly. She knew what she had to do, and accepted that.  It was good that Kasumi did too.</p><p>Kasumi looked the brood mother in the eyes. "I know what you'll  have to do. And it's better than what Alexia's doing to her. I just  wish..." Kasumi closed her eyes. "Why wasn't it me?"</p><p>Ranma thought for a few seconds. "It was supposed to be you,  but... you fought back. Alexia wants to hurt me not you."</p><p>"And taking Nabiki doesn't do that?"</p><p>Ranma decided to go with honestly. "No, not as much as if she  had gotten my fiancee. She has Akane; she knows that. She knows my  feelings."</p><p>Kasumi's expression closed any further discussion along those lines.  There was only so much the agent could handle at a time.</p><p>"I'm just saying that Aurora attacked because <i>you</i> were at  your weakest, then, not Nabiki."</p><p>"Then why was she taken?"</p><p>"They didn't want to come back empty-handed? Maybe Eclipse  remembered Nabiki. What I don't get is why Eclipse didn't help  Aurora. Both of them could have taken you."</p><p>Kasumi's gaze hardened. "Maybe they don't get along. Maybe  Aurora was supposed to take me alone and Eclipse was there to watch  her."</p><p>"I'll be sure to ask before I tear into Aurora," Ranma  promised</p><p>A silver and blue haired demon smiled as she looked over her body. "I  take back everything I said about demons, Akane," she laughed,  her sky-blue eyes twinkling. She was then knocked down to the ground  by a blow to her back.</p><p>"Don't call me by that name," Eclipse growled.</p><p>"Know your place, little sister," Aurora added.</p><p>The new succubus stood back up to her full height. She looked at  Eclipse's platform heels and smirked. "We're both demons now  sis. It's a level playing field. And I always was smarter than you."</p><p>Eclipse's arms suddenly went out to the impudent girl. One grasped  her by the neck and lifted her off the ground and the other gently  rubbed at her horns. "Level?" Eclipse laughed. "You're  a newborn, not even weaned from Mother."</p><p>The silver-blue-haired demon's sight dimmed as her body was assaulted  from conflicting sensations. Her powder blue and white wings drooped  as did her blue finned-tail.</p><p>Before her vision darkened completely, the new succubus lashed out  blindly striking Eclipse hard against the side of a sensitive horn.  Surprised by the unexpected and painful attack, Eclipse dropped  Nabiki and fell sprawling onto the floor.</p><p>"Know your place little sister," the silver-blue-haired  demon spat at Eclipse.</p><p>Eclipse rose, growled, and unsheathed her talons. "You're going  to regret that you bitch," she said as both demons faced off.</p><p>"That's enough!" Alexia angrily shouted as she suppressed  her glee. It was what she expected. Her new daughter's mostly  unaltered mind was irritating her other daughters immensely. Perfect.  She would be able to try a new track with this daughter. "Yuki!  I expected better of you."</p><p>"Yes mother," Yuki bowed. She was not terribly keen on her  new name, but mother had given it to her.</p><p>"Yuki," Eclipse smirked. "I see how that fits our  little ice princess."</p><p>"You're making fun of the name our mother gave me." Yuki,  who was still bowing, allowed a small smile to form.</p><p>"Indeed," Alexia noted as she walked up to Yuki. "However,  she is right. You are the youngest of us, and yet... your body does  not reflect this."</p><p>Yuki shivered when she looked up into her mother's green eyes. "I  see."</p><p>"Soon enough you will," Alexia assured as she led Yuki over  a bed. "We will correct this mismatch in your maturity."</p><p>"But mother-" Yuki started but stopped when Alexia glared  at her.</p><p>"Defying your older sisters is one thing, but you will NOT defy  me." Alexia growled. "I see that I was too lax with you."</p><p>Yuki froze. Instincts that she hardly understood were telling her to  obey immediately and her intellect agreed. Anything to minimize what  was going to happen to her.</p><p>"Good," Alexia laughed. "Don't struggle. You might  damage something." She then flared with power and sunk her fangs  back into the girl. The brood mother summoned her power and went to  work.</p><p>Yuki cried out and lost consciousness as her body shifted and changed  again.</p><p>Shortly, Alexia finished. She turned to Eclipse and Aurora who had  been watching happily. "What do you girls think?" she asked  as she caressed the slumbering succubus.</p><p>"She's now definitely the younger sister," Aurora noted.</p><p>"Can she be even smaller, Mother?" Eclipse politely asked.  Yuki would need to be taught her place.</p><p>Alexia grinned, a daughter after her own heart. "Good idea. Yes,  she can." She turned back to Yuki and made the adjustment's in  the young demon's height.</p><p>"Perfect work Mother," Eclipse choked out. She was still  blushing from the praise mother had given her.</p><p>"It's time to wake up Yuki," Alexia said as she kissed her.</p><p>"Mommy?" Yuki asked as she floated back to consciousness.  She looked at her hands in puzzlement. They seemed smaller. She then  noticed that her hair had somehow lengthened and was spilling in  front of her vision. Her eyes went to the collection of  floor-to-ceiling mirrors that covered one wall.</p><p>"Go ahead," Alexia encouraged as she helped the girl to her  feet.</p><p>"I'm... I'm younger," Yuki said as she padded closer to her  reflection. She looked similar to how she did just before she entered  high school. <i>Minus a few inches</i>, she mentally corrected. She  looked around to see her family towering above her. She briefly  wondered if she was even shorter than the Traitor.</p><p>"Yes," Alexia laughed as she hugged her little girl. "You  are my youngest daughter, and now you're in the proper body. Isn't  this better?" She asked as she rubbed both of Yuki's horns.</p><p>Yuki nodded as she purred.</p><p>"Well, I have other matters," Alexia said as she kissed  Yuki again. "Listen to your big sisters while I'm gone."  She then turned and left the room for her own chambers.</p><p>Yuki turned to see her sisters advance on her.</p><p>"You heard mother," Eclipse coyly said. "We have to  help you. I think you need a new style first off."</p><p>"Yes," Aurora agreed. "I have an idea for our little  ice princess."</p><p>"I'm not going to be your toy," Yuki hissed.</p><p>Eclipse reached out and snagged Yuki's slim wrist. "You should  listen to mother. ' Don't struggle. You might damage something.' "</p><p>Yuki slid out her own white-blue claws and barred her fangs.</p><p>"She's got spirit sis," Aurora laughed.</p><p>"You always had to be difficult sis," Eclipse sighed.</p><p>Lieutenant Richards looked down the hallway as he closed the door to  Section Chief Tofu Ono's lab. He had been ordered to present his  report to the Forensic Pathology head, but he was not in his lab at  the time. In addition to dropping off the file, Richards used the  opportunity to prevent his time from being wasted.</p><p>He almost allowed himself to be startled by Colonel Edwards and some  Operations Major he did not recognize. The two men had a hushed  conversation as they walked down the corridor. Richard's innate  curiosity led him to eavesdrop on the two men. He only caught bits of  their conversation, but what he did catch worried him.</p><p>"I am pleased at your promptness in arriving," Jacob  stated.</p><p>"General Anderson insisted," Major Randal Koster replied.  "This is an important facility, and your reports have raised  questions."</p><p>Jacob nodded. "That's why you're here. To verify our activities  and to check into that officer."</p><p>"From what I've seen the situation is... unorthodox but being  handled properly." Koster allowed, he would have rather talked  to Jacob in the privacy of his office, but the officer wanted to talk  while they walked on the way back from Major Saotome's lab. That had  been an.. informative meeting. More so than the videos he had seen  before. "The situation is sensitive. Especially with this Alexia  woman."</p><p>Jacob nodded. "And of the other issue?"</p><p>"It's a serious charge. That man, are you sure?"</p><p>"Only people you trust are capable of betraying it."</p><p>"Mother," Yuki whined as she clutched onto Alexia.</p><p>"What happened now?" Alexia asked as she soothed her  daughter.</p><p>"Eclipse and Aurora keep dressing me up. They're mean when I  don't agree." Yuki shuddered. The bruises healed fast enough,  but when pain was used in combination with her horns it was...  unnerving</p><p>"But you look so adorable," Alexia countered. The light  blue cheongsam, with silver embroidery, she wore fit her body nicely  and complimented her long hair, which was held back with a pair of  ribbons.</p><p>"I guess so," Yuki relented, with an embarrassed blush. She  did take pride in how she looked, and was pleased that Mother  appreciated what she went through at the hands of those two. "They're  so forceful and aggressive, though."</p><p>"You are younger, so sometimes they have to be more forceful  when they know what's right and you refuse to listen. Besides,  they're being nicer to you?"</p><p>"They liked my makeup today," Yuki noted with pride.  Eclipse had actually given a begrudging compliment on it. She then  got angry when Yuki refused to wear the right shoes. Yuki hated those  strapped high-heeled powder-blue pumps; she felt that Chinese  slippers would match the style thrust upon her better. Aurora and  Eclipse had other ideas.</p><p>"But why do I have to do what they say?"</p><p>"They're your big sisters," Alexia hugged. "They're  just helping you. They're only mean when you're stubborn and  disrespectful to them. It's much easier when you just agree with  them."</p><p>"I guess so," Yuki sighed. She wanted to ask when she would  be able to decide for herself, but knew it was best to hold her  tongue. It did not take her long to figure out how to avoid her  sisters' ire, and more importantly, Mother's. She did not have to  like the rules but she had to know them.</p><p>"Besides, you have me," Alexia smiled. "Remember when  I punished Eclipse for throwing you against that wall, and for a  silly thing like not cleaning her room fast enough."</p><p>"I know. I don't know what I'd do without you," Yuki purred  as she reveled in Mother's presence.</p><p>"Good, I'm happy you girls are getting along," Alexia  picked up a small notepad covered in neatly written letters and  handed it to Yuki. "Now last time, you were talking about the  Traitor and her relationship with this human?"</p><p>"Have you seen Sunshine?" Naoko asked the pony-tailed  blonde after stopping her between classes</p><p>"Sorry, I haven't." Usagi blinked "Why are you asking  me?"</p><p>"You were with us when Sunshine and us went clothes shopping.  Remember your little white dress?" Samantha reminded.</p><p>"White dress?" Ami asked with a small smirk.</p><p>"So that's where you got that dress," Janet noted.</p><p>"We were just curious and thought you might know. You seem to be  Sunshine's friend too." Naoko sighed</p><p>"It's not just her either. Nariko and Akane are gone too."  Samantha absently looked at the cuffs to her uniform. "Heck,  Akane's sister has been absent for a few days too now."</p><p>"I don't know what's going on," Usagi shrugged. "If  you guys do find out, could you tell me?"</p><p>"Have you tried calling her?" Ami asked with flat tone. Her  mind had returned to Janet's mother. That woman had no solid proof  that something was up with her daughter but she was still suspicious.</p><p>"I did. Eventually, I got Sunshine. She sounded like she had  been crying. She didn't say what was wrong. That was the day before  yesterday, and the last I managed to talk to her." Naoko  confessed.</p><p>"I see," Usagi stated. "I hope she gets okay."</p><p>Samantha and Naoko nodded and went on their way.</p><p>"Why hasn't she contacted us anyway?" Janet asked once  Naoko and Samantha were out of earshot.</p><p>"I think something happened to her family," Ami proposed.</p><p>"Oh dear." If someone had done something to anyone that  Sunshine had cared about... Usagi nearly stumbled as a graphic image  entered her mind. There was blood... blood and violence.</p><p>Yuki smiled as she negotiated with the shopkeeper. The human found  her simply adorable and her ill ease at the teen's older sisters was  put to rest by her pleasant demeanor. "Thank you, I'm sure my  sisters will just love the discount," she bowed as she walked  back to the mirrored room where Eclipse and Aurora were primping.</p><p>"Wow, you look really great in that dress, Eclipse. Excellent  taste. Did you pick it out yourself?" Yuki asked already knowing  the answer.</p><p>"No... Aurora did," Eclipse replied.</p><p>"She's very good at fashion." Yuki innocently said as she  smiled at Aurora.</p><p>Eclipse studied the diminutive girl. Her tone was respectful. "Why  you..."</p><p>"Calm down, she just complimented me," Aurora sighed. It  was annoying, if she didn't know any better she'd think Eclipse was  jealous.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Yuki softly stated with her head down. "You  picked out a perfect China-mini and accessories for me," she  offered as she posed in her pink, silver-trimmed, miniskirt-length  cheongsam, matching pink heels, and complimentary pink lipstick and  blue eyeshadow.</p><p>Eclipse's glare softened. She was getting paranoid. Yuki had become  such a simple girl, so eager to please and respectful. It was plain  as day. "Did you get the discount?" she asked, hoping for a  reason to correct the girl.</p><p>"Yup! I got forty percent off. I did just like you told me to."  Yuki praised. <i>Though I added some tips from mother and... before,  </i>she thought behind her vapid smile.</p><p>After a brief sigh of disappointment Eclipse allowed herself to smile  at the girl.</p><p>"Did-did I do something wrong?" Yuki asked picking up on  the sigh "What was it so I can fix it?" the girl's voice  dripped with a desperate, eager desire to please.</p><p>"Nothing. Um, good job Yuki-chan. See how easier things are when  you listen."</p><p>"Oh yes," Yuki agreed basking in positive reinforcement.  Things were much easier when she obeyed them, especially given how  clueless they could be.</p><p>Seeing Yuki's respectful eagerness, Eclipse continued. "It was  like last night. You were worried about your first hunting night, but  with your body and my advice..."</p><p>"Yes, it was very fun," Yuki blushed. Satiating her urges  had been almost as good as the compliments her sisters had given her  afterwards. Though she had no idea why they thought it was a great  accomplishment. With her body it was easy to find someone up to  standards and then relieve them of their money afterwards. But, it  was the first time they had treated her like a... sister.</p><p>"Zip me up," Aurora ordered, but without venom in her  voice.</p><p>Yuki happily complied. If her big sisters insisted on acting this way  she would not stop their foolishness, besides she did enjoy being  needed by them. "That dress really compliments your tan. You  look like mother," Yuki gushed before she wandered off to the  shoe section.</p><p>Eclipse tilted her head, but her gaze hardly lingered on her innocent  little sister. "Mother favors me you know."</p><p>"Of course you are the eldest and strongest," Aurora  replied, but her snide tone caused Eclipse to clench her fists.</p><p>Yuki hummed happily to herself while at the other side of the store  her sisters argued. She was seeing if the store had her preferred  style: fancy and cute, strapped, pumps. She decided on a white and  coral pink set that fit her feet and walked back to her sisters. The  money she had collected last night would allow for her extra  purchase.</p><p>When she returned she saw that Eclipse had Aurora pinned on her knees  and was applying pressure to her neck and where the girl's horns  would have been. She remained respectfully silent and waited until  Eclipse finished.</p><p>"It's a shame when the older of my little sisters acts more  immature," Eclipse sighed as she let go of Aurora. "Don't  you agree?" She asked Yuki.</p><p>"Of course," Yuki happily concurred. It was easy to just go  with the flow of her role, especially when Eclipse was posturing like  this.</p><p>Eclipse smiled. "At least one of my sisters knows her place."</p><p>"I'm sorry," Aurora said after she caught her breath. She  would have liked to fight Eclipse formally, that way if she lost,  which she doubted would happen, she lost with honor, but mother gave  them orders to keep a low profile.</p><p>"Come on, we've got what we needed," Eclipse said as she  gathered her items. Her sisters followed her to the counter. Their  items were rung up at the reduced rate that Yuki had negotiated and  paid for with a credit card of young woman who only went missing a  few hours ago, except for Yuki's pair of shoes. That she paid for  herself.</p><p>Yuki took the card back from the saleswoman and smiled when she  returned it to her pink purse. Alexia's idea to use the credit and  bank cards of their "recruits" was not a bad one, but Yuki  recommended that they stop using them after a couple days. It would  not do to help those meddling humans find them.</p><p>Mother agreed with the idea, and that Yuki was tactful enough to  mention it when they were alone. She knew it would be  counterproductive to make her sisters jealous.</p><p>Eclipse was walking through the door when she froze. Driving down the  street was a plain black van. What she sensed in the vehicle was  quite familiar to her. "Out the back! Now!" she ordered to  her sisters.</p><p>"Humans?" Aurora hissed.</p><p>Eclipse nodded and turned back and walked to the back of the shop.</p><p>Yuki gave a brief glance at the street. The van gave no indication of  slowing but she was sure that it was full of agents. Undoubtedly,  they had called their masters and were waiting for the Traitor to  arrive. She ran after her sisters. That they, of all demons, where  this afraid was something she took to heart.</p><p>Eclipse led her sisters out the back door, down and alleyway and then  found a young man more than willing to give three shopping girls a  ride home. Later, Alexia would laugh at Eclipse's narrow escape and  her method of procuring a new recruit After the brood mother  converted the new minion, the car was dumped in a parking lot a few  miles away as a precaution.</p><p>Alfred Stevenson lay in his bed lightly dozing. The door creaked open  and the subtle scent of leather, fresh soap, and newly shampooed hair  wafted into the room. His eyes rapidly opened and focused on the  succubus at the door.</p><p>"You freshened up; I see," Alfred sighed as he leaned back  again.</p><p>"I shower a lot," Ranma shrugged. "Besides, I don't  want to scare the piss outta you and show up all bloody and smellin'  like hellfire."</p><p>"I've had worse."</p><p>"I can imagine," Ranma could feel her kids walk into the  room. She turned and saw Nariko wave at the agent.</p><p>Alfred coughed. "Sorry that you didn't get to your daughter in  time, at that clothing store," He stated, anything to remove the  awkward silence.</p><p>"It's okay. I came as fast as I could. At least we know more  about them. What Nabiki looks like now for example," Ranma  sighed. Kasumi was the one that confirmed the identity of the third  demon. She recognized Nabiki's face from store's security  cameras. Kasumi was horrified at what had been done to her, and  Ranma was dumbfounded. What purpose was there to making her  younger? Also, Alexia seemed set on spreading her terrible fashion  sense to all of her stolen broodlings.</p><p>"So what are you doing here?" Alfred asked.</p><p>"I'm thanking you, you and Morrison. You guys..."</p><p>"We were doing our job, Ma'am." Alfred flexed his hand. "To  be honest your daughter's help did help us."</p><p>Nariko smiled at the compliment.</p><p>"How's the leg?" Ranma asked after putting an arm around  her daughter.</p><p>"I still have it. If that's what you mean." Alfred looked  down at the bottom of the bed where it was clear that a pair of feet  were under the covers. "I'll have to go through rehab, and  there's still a chance I won't be able to go back to field duty."</p><p>"Well, if that falls through talk to me. I'm sure I can help get  you back into the field," Ranma gave a fanged smile.</p><p>"Oh... uhh thanks." Alfred said after he figured out what  the succubus had offered.</p><p>"Don't worry. There's more than one way to do it. Provided  you're not dying of course." Ranma added.</p><p>"Good luck getting your daughter back," Alfred said after  blinking. He should have known she'd make an offer like that. Even  nice succubae that were good comrades and drinking buddies were still  succubae.</p><p>Eclipse nodded in approval when she saw how clean her room was. Her  eyes turned to her little sister who had curtsied and kept her head  bowed in respect. The maid's uniform had been Eclipse's idea but  having it white and pink and frilly and risqué, had been  Yuki's. Eclipse had heartily approved of that. She found the whole  process... empowering.</p><p>Yuki had put a lot of effort into the uniform, from the pink bustier,  which was modified to allow for her natural form, to the tiny pink  skirt that showed off her frilly white lace panties to her little  white apron tied with in a big bow in the back. Eclipse was  particularly pleased with Yuki's footwear selection.</p><p>Her little sister was wearing a pair of above the ankle dark pink,  three inch heel boots with fur trim and shinny buckle accents.  Eclipse did not like the pointed toes or the spiked heal of the  shoes, but she had to admit that they looked good on her little  sister.</p><p>Eclipse remembered the fun that Yuki had while deciding on which  stockings to wear. Ultimately she went with white ones with little  pink bows to hold them up at mid-thigh. The bit of taut tummy and  narrow waist that the abbreviated top showed also pleased Eclipse. As  much as she felt that those Chinese dresses suited Yuki it was a  shame that she could not have a bare midriff in them.</p><p>"Are you satisfied?" Yuki softly asked as she clutched a  duster in her manicured hands.</p><p>"Very much," Eclipse agreed after she inspected her room.  She walked back to her little sister and gently rubbed Yuki's horns.  "You did well."</p><p>"It's... it's my... pleasure to serve," Yuki gasped out  between purrs. When Eclipse finished, Yuki looked reverently into her  sister's eyes. Mother's advice had made her big sisters so much  easier to live with. Now, they were nice. They looked out for  her and only punished her because they cared.</p><p>Eclipse noticed something slightly odd. It was too cutesy to be out  of place, but... "What is that?" she asked looking at the  bracelet that Yuki wore</p><p>"It's a charm bracelet with Hello Kitty and Barbie and..."</p><p>Eclipse zoned out and nodded while her little sister listed each cute  charm in nauseating detail.</p><p>"Isn't it the cutest thing?" Yuki squealed with delight.  "Mother said she would buy me some plushies that match it, too!"</p><p>"That's... good," Eclipse smiled.</p><p>"There you are," Alexia said as she walked into the room.  "Are you done with Yuki, Eclipse? I need to talk to her."</p><p>"Of course," Eclipse said as she released the little maid.  She used to be jealous of the attention that Yuki received, but  mother had explained that Yuki was simply being used as an  information source, to help defeat the Traitor. Eclipse respected  that, Yuki was too weak to be a full warrior, but she still helped in  what ways she could.</p><p>While Yuki followed her mother her clothing shifted back into her  preferred cheongsam. The maid's outfit was nice for cleaning, but it  was not who she was. "Yes mother?" Yuki asked as she  entered Alexia's suite.</p><p>Alexia put her arm around the smaller demon. "I must commend  your performance. You're quite skilled. You became exactly what your  sisters wanted while still serving me perfectly. Though it worked a  bit too well didn't it?"</p><p>"Mother?"</p><p>"I don't think it's an act anymore," Alexia said as she ran  her hand through Yuki's long hair. She had been watching this one  carefully and wanted her to come out perfect. "It felt too good,  you were too happy. Is there anything left? Even a tiny core that's  not the perfect little sister?"</p><p>Yuki leaned her head onto Alexia and nodded sadly.</p><p>"It must have hurt to lie to your sisters like that. To lie to  me."</p><p>"I'm sorry mother," the young demon sobbed.</p><p>"Don't worry. I know you tried and you almost did it. I'll  reward you with a little cleaning of my own," Alexia promised as  her eyes glowed.</p><p>Yuki blinked when the tingling in her mind stopped. "But... I  don't feel any different Mother."</p><p>"Of course not. It was just a minor little thing. The part that  thought it was acting."</p><p>"I always was Yuki. I was just blind. Until you showed me."  Yuki hugged her mother and increased her sobbing.</p><p>"It was my pleasure. You deserve to be rewarded for your work,"  Alexia said as she led her daughter to the couch and handed Yuki's  notebook to her. "Now you were suggesting an ambush against the  Traitor?"</p><p>Yuki beamed. Both because she had worked so hard on the idea and that  Mother had an interest in it. "Oh yes. Well, it's really yours.  I just... helped." She blushed.</p><p>"Go on," Alexia coaxed.</p><p>"The key is to get it to be just you and the Traitor. Without  her cheating allies you would be free to take charge."</p><p>"Yes, and the weaknesses you told me about would be exploited  beforehand," Alexia nodded. "That could make things...  fun."</p><p>"And big sisters' mates would be taken care of too," Yuki  added with a smile. If things worked out as they should only one weak  brood mother would need to die.</p><p>End Chapter</p><p>Special thanks to my prereaders: Trimatter,  PyroRaven, Kevin Hammel, J St C Patrick, Wray, mondu quiambao, Truk.
