</div><p>The Return</p><p>A Ranma Sailor Moon fic thingy.</p><p>By Josh Temple</p><p>Naturally, I own neither Sailor Moon nor Ranma. So here's  the disclaimer</p><p>Ranma 1/2 and its characters and settings belong to Rumiko  Takahashi, Shogakukan, Kitty, and Viz Video. Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon  belongs to Naoko Takeuchi, Koudansha, TV Asahi, and Toei Douga, and DIC.</p><p>Previous chapters and other works can be found at my  website.</p><p>Chapter 5 Revelations and Rendezvous</p><p>Ranma was  in the commissary. The large room was empty save for three Company agents  softly talking in one corner, and a man behind the counter that connected to a  kitchen. The martial artist was silently eating his early lunch. He was focused  on the consumption of food. He was trying to block his memory of the morning's  events.</p><p>The agent  working behind the counter took his order without question. Ranma did not see a  cash register or any sort of payment slot and supposed that the Company did not  charge its employees to eat in their cafeteria.</p><p>The Company  might be a disturbing organization of dubious ethics and methods, but they did  have good food. Ranma was working on his third bowl of beef stew when he saw  his fiancee enter the room. "What do you want?" he asked, an edge on  his voice.</p><p>Kasumi  smiled slightly at this. "Oh, nothing. You did very well out there  today," she said as she sat down. She had changed out of her combat  clothes, showered, and had dressed in her casual wear of boots, slacks, blouse,  and forty-five caliber handgun.</p><p>"So  that's it? Nice job and a pat on the back," Ranma said critically. "You  guys suck! Unlike you, I don't like being turned into a soulless killing  machine."</p><p>Kasumi  sighed. "So you regret what you did. If you had to do it over again, would  you have stayed in bed and done nothing?"</p><p>"No. I  still would have gone in and fought them." Ranma said, looking into the  girl's hard brown eyes. <i>I'm not so sure  about Kuno though</i>, he admitted to himself. <i>Sure he's alive, but as a demon- chick. Pluto would find that </i>real<i> amusing.</i> "But you guys knew that. You  knew that I would go in there. You didn't know how much I'd cooperate with you,  but you knew that I would go in. You took advantage of that."</p><p>"It  looks that way," Kasumi flatly stated.</p><p>"Yeah,  you don't care much about that do you?"</p><p>"Nope,"  Kasumi honestly replied. "Look Ranma, we're in a war. A war that you  agreed to participate in."</p><p>"Pluto  lied to me!"</p><p>"Maybe  about the curse," Kasumi allowed. "But she did mention the fighting  evil part. The fukus are stupid, but those girls have an impressive  record." <i>And an amazing amount of  dumb luck from the look of things,</i> she thought.</p><p>"So  we're all on the same side, eh? One big happy family."</p><p>"Why  not? Compared to those things that we fight," Kasumi said as her face  darkened. "You know what these creatures were planning to do today. They  were going to corrupt and brainwash school children and use them as  cannonfodder. These are the type of <i>monsters</i>  that we fight. <i>Things</i> that will <i>murder children</i> without a second thought!  You can't negotiate with them. You can't rehabilitate them. They <i>must</i> be exterminated, one-by-one if need  be, and damn the cost!" Kasumi said as her control slipped the slightest  bit.</p><p>Ranma  looked at the woman with a glimmer of understanding and a bit of fear.</p><p>"Like  it or not, you're in this war, and the only thing making you fight is your own  sense of right and wrong," Kasumi continued.</p><p>"So  why are you here?"</p><p>"Jacob  would like to speak with you," Kasumi said simply.</p><p>"And  what does he want?"</p><p>"Ever  wonder what happened to your mother?" the operations agent asked.</p><p>Usagi sat  on the stoop of the apartment building. About fifteen minutes after those two  men from the Company left, Setsuna managed to return Usagi's calls. Following  the brief conversation, Usagi was told to wait outside. Meiou said she was  driving over.</p><p>A large dark  green two-door car stopped in front of the apartment. The idling engine sounded  powerful. Usagi could almost see air being pulled into the large, low-slung,  intake scoop in the center of the hood. The blonde was not a car person. She  had no idea that it was a custom-job 1968 Dodge Charger as opposed to the 1974  Dodge Charger that Setsuna said she was driving over. She walked over to the  car.</p><p>The heavily  tinted driver's side window slid down revealing a familiar face. It was not a  tanned woman with red eyes and long green hair, but a somewhat pale man of  indeterminate age with watery grey eyes and short brown hair. It was Murdock. Usagi's  eyes flared in anger. Here was the man who had killed her boyfriend. Here was  the man who had ruined Ranma's chances at getting a cure. The monster was in  front of her. Hell, he might have killed Setsuna and stolen her car.</p><p>Usagi had  flipped out her transformation compact, and had started her transformation  phrase.</p><p>"Please  don't," Murdock said in a calm, almost depressed, voice.</p><p>Usagi  paused. That was an unexpected tone.</p><p>"You  can transform and attack me if you want," Murdock admitted. "But I  just got this car and I'd prefer it not to be wrecked," he said as he  patted the dash.</p><p>Usagi hit  the panic button on her communicator.</p><p>"Sure,  call your friends. You'd tell them anyway," Murdock sighed.</p><p>"What  do you want?" Usagi asked sternly.</p><p>"It's  not what I want. It's what I have to do," Murdock laughed. It was the  rough, unpleasant sound of a man who was desperately trying to stay sane. "Pluto  thinks that I'm the mastermind of all this. I guess she can't accept that I'm  just another pawn in this tiresome game."</p><p>Usagi  blinked. Setsuna did admit that Murdock had to be working for someone else,  something very powerful. "You still killed him," she said, looking  into those strange grey eyes. His corneas almost seemed to be filled with  squirming motes.</p><p>"It's  not like it was the first time he died," the man joked. "I see that  Setsuna is still overestimating my impact, and still keeping you in the dark."  Murdock stated. He allowed a small smile to form on his face.</p><p>"She  knows you're up to something," Usagi said defiantly.</p><p>"But  she doesn't know what it <i>is,</i>"  Murdock smiled. "That's pretty funny. After all she knows the Gate. Hell,  she <i>is</i> the Gate. She is the key and  guardian of the Gate. Past, present, and future, are all one in her, or at  least they used to be."</p><p>Usagi  blinked. That made sense. Setsuna was deeply connected to the Time Gates and  her staff was a giant key.</p><p>Murdock  continued. "She knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where  they'll break through again. And yet- she is also of Yuggoth. That is most  curious. The Mi-Go were never too fond of old Yogi."</p><p>"Yuggoth?"  Usagi asked.</p><p>"It's  another name for the ninth planet," Murdock said dismissively. "I  have to ask you something."</p><p>"What?"  Usagi said, still clutching her transformation device.</p><p>"Why  is your daughter still alive?"</p><p>"If  you harm her-"</p><p>"That's  not a threat." Murdock said. His voice was hard. The man seemed genuinely  insulted by that. "Quite the opposite," he then said, this time  smiling.</p><p>"What  are you talking about?"</p><p>"Paradoxes.  Remember the last time that happened? Neherenia's  little curse hit your boy-toy. He was doomed to die, and she started to fade  out. But now she's fine and he's dead."</p><p>"Pluto saved her."</p><p>"If that's what she told  you," Murdock said, his grin growing. "Still believe that love  and hope will save your daughter... and the future?"</p><p>Usagi glared at the man in the  driver's seat. "What are you insinuating?"</p><p>"Certain people have had an  interest in her before. Although, I can't say that those alterations made her  any better. I mean, turning a spoiled brat into an insufferable bitch."</p><p>Usagi looked at him questioningly. Murdock  knew of the Black Moon Family. Was he connected to them in any way? They had  been defeated, but so had the Dark Kingdom. "You're not from the  future are you?" the blonde asked.</p><p>"Close,"  Murdock smiled slightly. "You think of time solely in linear terms,  forward or backward. I guess sideways never occurred to you. Think of a mystery  train that travels through lands riddled with fallout and demons, past that  damn tower where even death dies, and right into the twisting churning nuclear  chaos at the heart of everything. Is it all mystery, a riddle, or a joke?"  Murdock stated as his grin twitched.</p><p>"What <i>are</i> you talking about?"</p><p>"It's rather simple," the  man said before he recognized the car that was approaching the parking lot. It  was the same make and model of his car, just six years newer. "Oh shit! Gotta  go," he said in a panicky apology just before he put his car into reverse,  turned it almost completely around, and pulled out of the side entrance to the  lot.</p><p>Usagi  watched the other green Dodge drive up to her. This time when the window slid  down she was rewarded with Setsuna's image. "Did he hurt you?" the  woman asked as she watched the other Dodge race away.</p><p>"No,"  Usagi said as she looked back at the apartment building. Where were the other  girls? She had hit the emergency button. "At least you heard my distress  call," the blonde said to the time guardian.</p><p>"No I  didn't," Setsuna admitted. "He must have blocked the signal,"  the emerald-haired woman stated as she slide over and opened the passenger side  door. "Get in," she nearly ordered.</p><p>Usagi  complied. As she buckled her belt, she noticed that Setsuna was not wearing her  safety belt.</p><p>"What  did he say?" Setsuna demanded as she drove her car back onto the road.</p><p>Usagi  paused before responding. It felt natural, right to do what Setsuna told her to  do. After all, she was older, much older, and had a lot more experience, but  recent events had caused the woman's motives to come into question. Setsuna had  never been forthright and seemed only to work with them when it suited her  goals.</p><p>"What  did he tell you?" Setsuna repeated. "You can't trust anything he says!"  Setsuna stated, paranoia creeping into her voice.</p><p>"He didn't  tell me anything. He just asked a question," Usagi said simply. She was  still digesting the tone of Setsuna's voice. The woman very rarely let her  emotions show, let alone reach into her voice.</p><p>"And  the question was?" Setsuna asked as she stopped at a red light.</p><p>"Why  is my daughter alive?" Usagi asked.</p><p>Setsuna  looked into her review mirror. "You know, we never figured out who  released Neherenia. You defeated her.  You imprisoned her. Then someone woke her up. And that same someone helped her  spread those mirror shards."</p><p>"Are you suggesting that  Murdock woke her up? That's insane! He killed Mamoru. If he was behind  Neherenia's return, why didn't Murdock kill him back then?"</p><p>"Why did he crash a 747 into  the Baring Strait when he was just going to kill Mamoru in a bathroom? Madness  is Murdock's misdirection" Pluto countered.</p><p>"You still haven't answered  that question," Usagi countered. "All I know is you found some way to  keep her from drifting away."</p><p>"Yes, I did." Setsuna  stated as she changed lanes. "When Neherenia came back and almost caused  that paradox, I knew that something was very wrong. There are supposed to be  safeguards to prevent such things. That's part of what the Time Gate does."</p><p>"What did you do?"</p><p>"I set it up so that your  daughter will no longer be affected by having Mamoru be dead."</p><p>"What did you <i>do</i>?"</p><p>"I asked him to give me several  samples," Setsuna finally admitted. "It was quite awkward, but now  they're all stored in several very safe places."</p><p>"My  god," Usagi said. "You had him- I mean - in the cup?"</p><p>Setsuna  nodded.</p><p>"I  see." It made sense. How else could a dead man father a child?</p><p>"I did  what I had to do," Setsuna said, not lying, yet not really answering her  question.</p><p>Usagi  nodded. Her concern as to why Murdock had told her to ask that question was  minimal. Murdock continuously did things that made little or no sense.</p><p>The  red-eyed woman was relieved. Usagi was not pushing the issue. Her own mind was  trying to understand why Murdock did that. Was he simply sowing discord, or did  he have a greater purpose. Kill the father, save the daughter? Setsuna did not  like knowing what was going to happen, let alone what had already happened.</p><p>Ranma  charged into Jacob's office. There was no attempt to stop him. "What's going  on here?" he demanded. "First you jerk this cure around on me, then  you guilt me into fighting, and finally you use my <i>mother</i> against me. Explain.   Now," Ranma stated in a dangerously calm voice.</p><p>Jacob  looked up from his report. "Major Saotome, Nodoka, Science and Technology  Section. Registration number 34528-88325-42821-90982," Jacob read from the  header of his file.</p><p>"Right,  like she's been working for you clowns," Ranma said with considerable  skepticism.</p><p>"For  over eight years. She heads one of our advanced materials labs," Jacob  stated.</p><p>"That's way too much of a  coincidence. I can't see my dad marrying someone like that."</p><p>"According  to this, she met your father during her undergraduate days. She then went on to  get her doctorate in materials science and engineering from Tokyo  University."</p><p>"Sure  she did. Look, Pops never talked about her. Hell, he told me that I didn't even  have a mother. I sure as hell don't remember ever having one."</p><p>"Yes,  that's why she came to us, all those years ago. The police couldn't find you or  him. So, she hired us."</p><p>"And  she just happened to be a scientist willing to make weapons for you guys. You  nimrods are pathetic."</p><p>"Well,  she mostly designs vehicle and personnel armor, and it was rather  convenient," Jacob admitted. "Setsuna, or perhaps Murdock, did  specifically select you."</p><p>"Prove  it. I want to see her."</p><p>"Okay,"  Jacob said simply. "She's at our base in Hokkaido now."</p><p>"And  this is where you say sorry but-"</p><p>"We  can have you on a flight in two hours," Jacob stated.</p><p>"Really,"  Ranma said skeptically.</p><p>"Simple.  You take a Company plane from here to the First Operations Centre in Kansas and  get on one of the regular flights that goes to the Third Operations  Centre."</p><p>"Right,  sure."</p><p>"The  Company also has those old samples of Jusenkyou water that you can try before  you go on to Japan, and if that doesn't work we can then take you to China."</p><p>"And  how will I explain that to my father?"</p><p>"You  want to bring him along so he can get cured?"</p><p>"No. I  haven't even started to punish him."</p><p>"Ahh,  the Sunshine thing," Jacob observed. "In that case you're just  spending a few days with Kasumi on a Company recruiting workshop."</p><p>Ranma  blinked. "You guys just love telling lies with the truth, don't you?"</p><p>Jacob  smiled. "So will you do it?"</p><p>"If it  will get rid of Sunshine and DarkStar."</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>Major  Saotome sat in her apartment's kitchen. She lived in one of the residential  buildings located within Operations Centre 3. Her rank allowed her to have private,  but small, housing. She lived alone and did not need that much space. It was  also cheaper, which allowed her to save more of her income.</p><p>She sipped  from a glass of water. She would have preferred something stronger, but she was  about to go back to work soon. The woman was trying to digest what had been  told to her. She had been ordered to Commander Akagi's office.</p><p>Nodoka  shook her head. Her son was alive and well. He was currently staying with an  operations agent. That was all that was written on the message the Commander  had handed her. She found the lack of information troubling. She did not even  know how they actually found Ranma or what had happened to Genma.</p><p>It was  unusual for them to split up. According to the reports, Genma kept a fairly  close eye on his son. Could something have happened to Genma? Was that why the  Company was able to find Ranma? The simple fact that there was not more  information meant that someone saw it fit to restrict that information. Something  was going on with her son.</p><p>"My  god," Nabiki said as she turned off the television.</p><p>"Good  thing that the police got there in time," Akane observed coldly. This was  not something that was supposed to happen here. Canada had no enemies. Canada  was obscure. There was no logical reason for them to come after us she tried to  rationalize.</p><p>"I  can't believe it," Nabiki remarked darkly.</p><p>"In  our school," Akane said as she stared off into space.</p><p>Nabiki  nodded. Reality had a troubling way of interfering with life.</p><p>"We're  back," Kasumi said as she opened the front door. Ranma followed her into  the house.</p><p>"You  see the news?" Akane asked rather innocently.</p><p>"Yes,"  Kasumi stated.</p><p>"Where's  Pops?" Ranma said as he narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"Out  back with father," Nabiki said as she looked at her older sister. The  young woman was her usual controlled self. Nabiki almost expected her to be  somewhat unnerved by the day's events. After all, the last time someone had  gotten killed at Furinkan, it was at Kasumi's hands.</p><p>"Poor  Drake," Genma remarked as he looked into the woods from the back porch.</p><p>"At  least he managed to avoid any student casualties," Soun said from the seat  next to him.</p><p>"But  why his school?"</p><p>"Who  knows what those dishonorable monsters were after," Soun stated as he took  a sip from his drink.</p><p>Genma then  turned when he heard the back door open. "You have a good day with  Kasumi?" he asked his son.</p><p>"Amazing,"  Ranma flatly stated.</p><p>"Excellent,"  Genma said in a pathetic imitation of an evil mastermind.</p><p>"Yeah  sure. I'm just telling you that I'll be going away for a few days or so."</p><p>"Really  where?" Genma asked as he put down his cup.</p><p>"I'll  be taking him on a Company workshop," Kasumi said as she walked onto the  porch.</p><p>"Good  for you," Soun said.</p><p>"Yes,  a brilliant plan," Genma added.</p><p>Ranma shook  his head and went back into the house.</p><p>Kasumi  smiled as she followed her fiance. That was easy.</p><p>Kasumi  drove her Company sedan to the Lester B. Pearson International Airport, located  to the northwest of the city. After passing through security, she drove her car  to the airport's freight terminal. Parked on the tarmac was a mid-sized  commercial jet. It was light grey with a thick black line on the tail. Within  that line was the Company logo. The letters, symbols, and globe seemed to float  in obsidian fluid. There were also several Company vehicles and agents in the  area. She stopped the car, walked out, and handed the keys to another agent.</p><p>"So  you chartered a plane for me," Ranma said as he exited the car.</p><p>"Nope,"  Kasumi said. "Command sent for a team from S and T to come up and look at  that gate in the basement. We'll be taking their plane back."</p><p>"I  see," Ranma said as he picked up his backpack and walked towards the  plane. <i>Wonderful. Going to fly halfway  around the world. That's if the water these nitwits have in storage doesn't  work. Which it probably won't. At least they'll take me to Jusenkyou, and after  this morning they should think twice about trying to mess with me.</i> Ranma  thought with a smile. It quickly disappeared when he recognized one of the  people standing near the plane.</p><p>It was a  pale girl with red eyes and black, violet highlighted, hair. A pair of black  shorts and a black tank top clung to her well-formed and human-looking body. The  girl noticed Ranma and ran over to her. "Mistress!" she cried as she  tried to hug the martial artist.</p><p>"Stop  it you freak!"</p><p>The girl  pulled back and cringed as if slapped. "But, but, you saved me," she  muttered.</p><p>"Why  is this thing here?"</p><p>"You  shouldn't be so mean to your minions," Kasumi remarked with a slight  smile.</p><p>"She's  –<i>he's</i>- not my minion."</p><p>Kasumi  looked at the sniffling girl and chuckled. "Kuno's father wants his son to  be human. The curse is a chance to help her."</p><p>"But,  Jacob said that Jusenkyou is ineffective against demons."</p><p>"Kuno  did change sex during the conversion. That might be due to your curse. So she  might be susceptible to the water. It's a slim chance."</p><p>"Just  like how I'm human right now, and might be able to get cured."</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"Okay,  I can understand wanting to get cured," Ranma said before turning back to  the Kuno girl. "You can come, but you will <i>not</i> touch me or do anything creepy. Understand?"</p><p>The girl  simply nodded enthusiastically. "One question if I may?" she asked.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Why  are you in this weak form now? This bag of meat you inhabit is pathetic  compared to your true power."</p><p>Ranma  rubbed his forehead. "What did I do to deserve this?"</p><p>"Come  on," Kasumi said to the two teenagers. "The plane's leaving  soon."</p><p>Ranma grumbled  as he walked to the plane. He was followed by a demonic minion happily humming  to herself. The plane had rows of two seats on either side of a central aisle. The  rows alternated between facing forward and backward. Kasumi walked toward the  back of the plane and sat down in a forward facing aisle seat. The woman then  took out her laptop and started typing into it.</p><p>Gabriel  looked up from his book. It was a thick volume documenting instances of  nonhuman activity from the twenties. The text made for an interesting if dry  read. The agent found the afternoon's actives unusual. Normally, after an  operation, there would be an extensive debriefing. But now they were going to  provide escort duty for a Pattern D - two Pattern Ds - Gabriel corrected  himself as he looked at the girl who was trying to sit next to Ranma.</p><p>To the  casual observer, the girl looked human, but Gabriel could tell that there was  something <i>off</i> about her. Reading the  Doctor's report helped things too. Gabriel shook his head and went back to the  documentation on how several Company agents discovered a group of Pattern L's  in Chicago.</p><p>Jacob  entered plane. He was carrying a grey metal briefcase. The man looked at Ranma  with an almost puzzled expression before taking the seat facing Kasumi. The door  to the plane then closed and locked into place. The aircraft then taxied into  position and waited for takeoff clearance.</p><p>Ranma  looked out the sixth story window. The sun had just finished setting and the  gently rolling farmland was cast in a dim orange and grey light. The farmland  ended over five miles from the building complex he was in. The Company  Operations Centre stood on an almost rectangular parcel of land that was about  eight by twelve miles and totaling over sixty thousand acres in area.</p><p>There was a  series of fences that marked the edge of the gigantic compound. One pair was at  the edge with another pair over half a mile inside it. Periodically there were  steel observation towers and small concrete pillbox-like buildings. A couple  pairs of Humvees with fifty caliber machine guns and missile launchers  patrolled the perimeter.</p><p>Ranma could  also see a pair of helicopters flying off in the distance. One was landing at  the private Company airport to the South of the central building complex and  the other was doing intricate maneuvers to the west. He then turned his  attention to the buildings directly below them.</p><p>Made of  concrete, steel, and glass, the buildings were squat with clean lines. Of  differing heights, shapes, and sizes, these buildings made up a central complex.  It resembled the bland campus of a technical school. Ranma had only been in  part of the underground levels, but he knew that there had to be miles of corridors  under the central complex. Like the Toronto facility, it was brightly lit,  mostly grey, and vaguely unsettling. Ranma was morbidly curious as to what sort  of business was conducted here. The facility seemed far too large for the task  of monitoring and controlling what the Company called Pattern Registering Entities.  Unless the situation with paranormal creatures was far larger than Ranma had  originally thought.</p><p>"I'm  sorry," Jacob said as he walked into the conference room Ranma was in.</p><p>"You  said it most likely wouldn't work," Ranma observed as he continued looking  out the window.</p><p>"That  water was sitting in a storage room for thirty years. Hell, that stuff was  collected before I started working here," Jacob noted.</p><p>"Yes, I  read the tags on the metal crate," Ranma stated as he turned to face  Jacob.</p><p>"With  our archives, proper labeling is a necessity," the Company Colonel stated.  Buried to the east were the warehouse-sized general archives. A smaller and  more secure depository housed the more interesting items.</p><p>"So  what now? You guys try to send me to China?"</p><p>"If  you want to go. A flight bound for Operations Centre Three departs in an hour,"  Jacob said as he exited the room again.</p><p>Ranma  nodded as he returned his gaze out the window. Another cure had failed. That is  if he could trust the water. Neither himself nor Kuno had been affected by the  water. Ranma supposed that they could have filled the containers with tap water  and then faked the documentation and the readings the scanners gave off.</p><p>His eye  twitched at the thought of this all being some Company trick. If these morons  were <i>that</i> stupid, he would show them.  He would show them all. It was a shame he'd have to turn into DarkStar to get  his revenge. Jacob seemed to be a tricky bastard, and Ranma wanted to be in a  form that was bulletproof if he had to take the older man out.</p><p>Rei walked  down the darkened forest path. It was late and the only light came from distant  ground light reflected off of the overcast sky. This created an orange tinted  grey-scaled coloration. She could hear Makoto walking behind her. The girl then  stopped just short of a small knoll. The brunette walked up to Rei and crouched  down next to her.</p><p>"Don't  you hate walking outside in heels?" Makoto quietly asked as she looked at  the just visible dwelling that sat in a clearing on the other side of the  knoll.</p><p>"I  don't know why Pluto insisted that we activate as soon as we got into the woods,"  Rei said as she rolled her eyes. "We're in position," she then said  into her communicator.</p><p>"So  are we," Mina's voice responded from the wrist-mounted device.</p><p>Makoto gave  a thumbs up to Rei and readied herself. Rei simply looked at the building with  mute horror. She could sense evil and corruption drifting out of the building  in lazy wisps. In spite of the nighttime cloud cover the cabin seemed to be  wrapped in more gloom and darkness than the rest of the forest.</p><p>"Pluto  was right. <i>He's</i> here," Rei  incorrectly assumed as she watched the building.</p><p>"Quiet,"  Makoto whispered. From their position they could just make out the cabin's front  porch. The door on it was now being opened. The girls could make out a dark  shape with softly glowing eyes exiting the building. They could see the shape  put a lighter to a cigarette. Smoke began to lazily curl from the smoldering  tube.</p><p>The shape  on the porch shut the door and leaned on it, appearing to enjoy its cigarette.  The still air was then punctuated by the sound of someone hitting the ground  somewhere in the forest. The entity at the porch dropped his cigarette and pulled  a large gun out from within his coat.</p><p>Makoto  watched the creature raise its shotgun and made her decision. There was a good  chance that was Usagi. She readied herself and began the attack. The girl then  spun in a circle, summoning hundreds of leaves. With a shout of "Jupiter  Oak Evolution," she charged the leaves and fired them at the shape on the  porch.</p><p>The entity  was hit by the magical attack and was blown apart. "Cover me," Sailor  Jupiter said as she moved towards the cabin. Rei watched as the front door  began to open. She waited until the targets were verified. It was a pair of  shadows with glowing eyes. She aimed and fired a single fire arrow at the  creature to the left and quickly launched another at its companion. They were  destroyed before Jupiter could add to the attack.</p><p>As Rei kept  her Mars Flame Sniper ready, she moved forward. Jupiter was halfway to the  porch. Rei looked over to see the others running in from their position at the  other side of the clearing.</p><p>Shots came  from inside the cabin. Ami shouted a number and pointed with her finger. The  blondes then fired into the building. Minako went first. The Crescent Beam lit  up the inside of the cabin, produced a flash that illuminated the entire  clearing for a second, and killed the one creature unlucky enough to be hit. Usagi  then launched a Moon Gorgeous Meditation into the cabin.</p><p>Sailor  Jupiter was the first inside the building. She found a small living room  littered with the sand-like remains of their enemy. The only sounds in the room  were strange, somewhat distorted, shrieks and explosions.</p><p>A  television was on in one corner of the room. Playing on it was a space battle between  two groups of ships, one was green and somehow squid-like and the other looked  like a cross between a spider and Makoto's worst nightmare.</p><p>"Anyone  in here?" Sailor Venus asked, surprising the brunette.</p><p>"None  in this room," Makoto said as she walked to the next room. It was the  kitchen. The smell of brine permeated the room. But when Makoto paused, she  could smell something under that salty scent. It was a familiar and horrifying  stench. It was a mix of blood, bile, urine, and worse. Makoto could see a large,  neatly folded tarp sitting next to the wall. It was heavily stained.</p><p>"What's  going on in here?" Usagi asked.</p><p>"Whoever's  left went out the back door," Minako stated, the smell of blood and salt  filling her nose.</p><p>Makoto  looked at the open door that lead outside and then at the other two in the  room. One was open and went to a small bathroom and the other was secured with  a heavy padlock.</p><p>"Okay  let's go," Usagi said, leading them out of the cabin and back into the  house.</p><p>Makoto  lingered for a second. She had a fair idea as to what was being done in this  cabin. She then followed the other Senshi outside.</p><p>Several  miles to the south, a monitoring device in the Hilton Falls Conservation Area had  detected their attacks. The data was transmitted to WIC Toronto-A where it was  decided to send out a strike team to investigate the mid-range Pattern Silver  discharges.</p><p>One of the  facility's helicopters was sent to where the signal was detected. The modified UH-60A  Black Hawk was followed by an armored strike team that would provide backup.</p><p>The  helicopter arrived on the scene and began orbiting the area. Its onboard  scanners detected several Pattern Silver signatures and some signatures that  were too weak to type. The pilot took his craft a bit closer.</p><p>His gunner  then saw, standing in a clearing, a group of girls in color coded miniskirts saturating  the forest with magical attacks. The video feed from his headset was then  transmitted to the C3. The pilot then received his orders.</p><p>Sailor  Mercury scanned the trees. The remaining creatures were somewhere in the  forest, but she was no longer picking them up on her scanner.</p><p>"Incoming!"  Ami shouted as a warning signal appeared on her visor. It was little  forewarning. While it was quieter than a normal helicopter of that size, the  Company modified machine was still rather loud.</p><p>The girls  turned to see the hovering machine drop four lines. From the ropes rappelled a  quartet of Company agents. They softly landed on the ground and quickly brought  their weapons at the ready. Once they were on the ground the helicopter pulled  up to a higher altitude.</p><p>Usagi  looked over the troops. Their camouflaged body armor, boots, and helmets, made  them appear to almost <i>melt</i> into the  background. A muted reddish-orange, their goggles were the only noticeable  part. Even their double barreled weapons were in that mottled pattern.  "Why are you here?" she then asked. Back in Tokyo, the authorities <i>never</i> arrived this fast. On the rare  cases that they bothered to come, they were always too late.</p><p>One of them  looked at the girls strangely before speaking "Two days ago a scout troop  went missing in the park to the south of here. All we found were some splatters  of blood that were tainted with strange chemicals. Our search was interrupted  by today's attack," Lieutenant William Paterson quickly explained to the  blonde. He looked over to see that his squad had taken covering positions at  the edge of the clearing.</p><p>"And  you just happened to see us," Rei said.</p><p>"Our  attacks <i>are</i> very flashy," Ami  stated.</p><p>Makoto  simply froze as her mind connected the missing people to the smell from that  cabin.</p><p>"Are  there still enemy targets out here?" Patterson asked.</p><p>"Yes,"  Ami said before telling the agent the last known position of the targets.</p><p>"Any friendlies  nearby?"</p><p>"No,  why are you asking this?" Usagi asked.</p><p>Patterson  simply smiled and called in the air strike. The two 7.62mm Gatling guns on the  helicopter opened fire. The tracers from the mini-guns blurred into lances of  flame.</p><p>Usagi almost  shrieked at the intense chainsaw-like noise. Why did their weapons have to be  so loud? She then watched as the Company agents fired several grenades from the  larger of their gun's barrels. Rei simply watched the attack. It made sense -  hit the enemy hard to ensure that it got killed.</p><p>Patterson  then gave the order for the helicopter to stop firing. He then had his men to  approach the target.</p><p>Makoto watched  as one of the armed agents moved past her. She shrugged and went after him. The  rest of the Senshi went with the agents further into the forest. Usagi could  see the scarred land where the aerial assault had taken place. The same gritty  sand-like substance was scattered all over the area.</p><p>"Forward  left, incoming!" one of the agents shouted as she started to fire into a humanoid  bundle of shadows.</p><p>"They're  cloaked," Ami shouted as she began to fire at the same spot.</p><p>Usagi could  see that the attacks had hit something, killed it, and turned it to more of  that strange sand. She then noticed a movement ahead of her. She turned and  attacked it.</p><p>Patterson  blinked. He did not just see that. Magically powered teenage girls in bows and  miniskirts were one thing, but that blonde did not just use a kaleidoscope as  if it were some type of particle beam weapon.</p><p>There  turned out to be only one other target remaining. It tried to move and was  blown apart by three magical attacks and two bursts of automatic weapons fire. "Check  the area," Patterson ordered his troops.</p><p>The Senshi  looked at each other, looked around, and went back to the cabin. Once again  Makoto found herself in the kitchen. She looked at the padlocked door. "I'm  going in," she said as she ripped off the lock.</p><p>"You  think someone's still in there?" Usagi asked.</p><p>Minako was  a waiting outside the back door with Ami and Rei. "They're back," Ami  stated as she watched the agents walk back out of the forest.</p><p>"Oh  god," Patterson said as he walked into the already crowded kitchen. The  smell was unmistakable. "Orbital One, tell HQ to send a forensic team."  He paused as he listened to the reply. "Really? Well tell them to have  another on standby. We'll probably need more," he said into his headset.  "Open it," he then ordered one of his men, who then went to the door  and scanned it for anything unusual.</p><p>"What  are you doing?" Usagi asked.</p><p>"We  may have found those missing kids," Patterson sighed from behind his  goggles and balaclava. "You should clear out of the cabin, it might be  booby trapped."</p><p>"No,"  Usagi said, reading an attack. Now she understood why Pluto had sent them here.  She still did not know how the Time Guardian learned of this place, but at  least she knew why she was here.</p><p>"Okay,"  Patterson shrugged. He had very specific orders for how to handle the Pattern  Silvers. "Do it."</p><p>The agent  at the door then  swung open the door. It  opened to a darkened stairway.</p><p>Makoto  smirked slightly. Here were two groups of soldiers, one pretty and sailor-suited,  and the other in camouflage and body armor. Both were intently watching the  stairway. It proved to be rather anticlimactic. The basement was empty of  enemies. The dirt-floored cellar was being used as a store room.</p><p>Mounted on  the rough walls were several shelves that held well over a dozen large jars. The  room was lit by only a few bare bulbs, but that was more than enough to make  out their contents. The Company agents looked at them with familiar revulsion.</p><p>"Dear  god," Makoto said looking at the dozens of neatly labeled jars of  brine-cured meat, bottles of blood and other fluids, opaque buckets of unknown  contents, and a large crate full of stained bones.</p><p>"We're  too late. Always too damn late," Patterson said as he and the agent with  him conducted a preliminary examination of the room.</p><p>"Strange  echo gradients coming from the containers," the other agent noted as he  scanned the jars and bottles.</p><p>"There's  a tilting autopsy table in right here," Patterson said in a cold  emotionless voice. "The drain appears to have clogged. Watch out for the  spill," he said with considerable distaste.</p><p>Usagi  looked at the room and shuddered. She then started regulating her breathing.  Previous enemies had been just as vicious and contemptible for human life, but  the bastards were not nearly this messy. She felt surrounded by this careful,  deliberate barbarism. It was oppressive and claustrophobic, like being  smothered by a burning couch.</p><p>"I  can't get a body count from this. There's at least an eight, most likely  more."</p><p>"Forensic  Pathology can figure out what they did. Let's go back topside," Patterson  ordered.</p><p>Back at the  porch, the girls were trying to make small talk with the agents who were with  them. "So what got you working for –um- the Company?" Minako asked the  taller of the two agents.</p><p>The man  turned to the girl and smiled. That much the blonde could tell. The man's mouth  was just about the only visible part of his body. "It was either this or  join the Marines, and frankly, the Company has better pay."</p><p>"Don't  mind Morrison," the other agent stated. "His whole family,  grandfather, father, uncle, brother and sister, are in the Corps, and he takes  a bit of flack for not being a 'real' solider."</p><p>"Shame  I can't tell them what I do," Morrison noted as he checked his scanner  again. The backup team should be arriving in five minutes.</p><p>"We're  not in it for the fame." Morrison's partner stated.</p><p>"Yeah,  we know all about that," Minako remarked.</p><p>"It is  amazing you've managed to keep your identities secret for so long. Sorry about  earlier today," Morrison stated.</p><p>"So  everyone at the Company knows who we are," Minako observed.</p><p>"Only  select members of our Toronto personnel." Morrison assured the girls. He  neglected to inform her that the command staff including section chiefs and  their alternates, most of Communications Cryptography, and almost all of  Operations made up the select members. He also neglected to tell them that it  was not a terribly hard thing to figure out.</p><p>Minako was  about to ask another question but was interrupted by Usagi bursting out of the  cabin. "What took you so long?" one blonde asked to another.</p><p>"The  basement's crammed with human parts," Makoto stated simply.</p><p>"Oh,"  Rei replied. "I guess it's good that you forgot to give a speech this  time."</p><p>Morrison  simply looked at his companion and sighed. They had expected this; it was too  large a group which had been missing for too long.</p><p>Minako  considered saying what the speech would be. Something like, "Organs and  blood are for transplants and transfusions, not for eating. In the name of the  moon, I will punish you!" She then decided to not say it. Those two girls  had just seen the results of a mass murder.</p><p>Suddenly, a  trio of Humvees and a pair of medium trucks with boxy cargo compartments drove  into the clearing. Their approach was masked by the sound of the circling  helicopter. The three Humvees quickly took positions around the cabin. Their  machine guns were manned and pointed out into the woods. The trucks stopped  near the cabin. From the backs of the trucks came two Forensic Pathology teams.  As the cabin was still an <i>active</i>  site, they were dressed in the same armor as the Operations personnel. In  addition to the mandatory weapons, they were also carrying several containers  for their scanning devices, cameras, specimen containers, and other equipment.</p><p>The Senshi  watched as they silently walked past and entered the cabin. A couple remained  in the kitchen to analyze what was in there. The rest went down the stairs and  into the basement.</p><p>Usagi  turned to see Lieutenant Patterson talking to his headset. "Forensics has  arrived. Yes, sir. The Pattern Silvers are still here. I'll ask sir." The  connection was then terminated. Patterson paused to reflect on the absurdity of  it all. "The Commander would like to see you," he said to the magical  girls.</p><p>Several  miles away Rod Ferris listened as the orbiting helicopter landed for a bit and flew  off. He shrugged. Losses were to be expected. He was still alive, and more  importantly, the plan was still proceeding on track.</p><p>Once again  Ranma found himself waking up to the sound of jet engines. He did not bother to  pull up the window cover. It would just show water and nothing else. He  stretched slightly; at least the chairs were comfortable.</p><p>Ranma looked  over to see that once again, the demon girl had moved to sit next to him. The  martial artist sighed as he quietly disconnected his safety belt. He would  rather let the creature sleep than wake it up just to yell at her. Ranma then  stood up and walked down the aisle.</p><p>"ETA  eight hours," Jacob said when Ranma passed him. The man had a laptop out  and had a headset plugged into it. "No sir, I was just talking to Ranma.  So what is the count according to forensics?"</p><p>Ranma  nodded before going down the remaining rows and into an open bathroom. After  closing the door he looked at his reflection and sighed. Eight more hours of  travel and then he'd be back in Japan.</p><p>He paused  considering this. His mother was supposedly there. Ranma assumed that Jacob was  telling the truth. It made no sense to lie about something like that. It would  only alienate Ranma further from the Company. It was also easily verifiable. His  father was still alive after all.</p><p>Ranma  supposed that the person he was about to see might be some sort of replicate of  his mother constructed to win him over, but that seemed too unlikely. Not that  likelihood meant anything to Ranma. Given that massive secret organizations, demons,  and magical girls existed, a deranged plan involving replicates might be perfectly  logical, but did the Company have time to do something like this? They had  first met him a couple days ago.</p><p>Ranma shook  his head as he walked back to his seat. He groaned as he looked at the sleeping  demon girl. That seemed like the right idea at the time. He did not want to let  the idiot die, but now he was stuck with the same obsessive nutcase, just with  a different gender and species.</p><p>Jacob had  offered to kill the girl, but that was not a particularly useful option. Maybe  Ranma could convince her to get a job with the Company, far, far away from him.  The martial artist smiled as he sat down in a new seat, this one in a new row  and on the opposite side of the aisle. That would get Kuno out of the way.</p><p>Bored and  unable to return to sleep, Ranma found himself asking one of the agents for  something to read. One of them shrugged and, after getting approval from Jacob,  pulled out a small laptop. He then activated a program and handed it to Ranma.</p><p>The martial  artist looked at the screen and found an outline with titles such as <i>Interpreting Pattern Recognition Systems,  Communications Signals, Properties Index for Pattern Registering Entities, </i>and  the ominous <i>Methods of Intelligence  Extraction</i>. There was also a feature that allowed the language to switch  between English, German, and Japanese.</p><p>Ranma tried  the signals section first. It was better than nothing and much better than  starting a conversation with anyone. He scrolled past pages of radio codes and  procedures, until he found something interesting. It was a series of drawings  that demonstrated various hand and arm signals and what they meant.</p><p>He  recognized several of them from the gestures that the Company goons had been  making in the school. Ranma shrugged and read that section, and when he finished  browsed for another section to read.</p><p>Sailor Moon  looked around the grey office. It was surprisingly spacious given that it was  located in an underground fortress. There was an area that contained two  couches facing each-other and another that had a desk and several chairs. There  were also two doors on either side of the room, one of them undoubtedly serving  for a bathroom.</p><p>"Hello,  I'm Commander Stillwater," the man behind the desk said as he got up.</p><p>"Sailor  Moon," the blonde responded.</p><p>Stillwater  smiled despite himself. He would rather Jacob do this, but he was with the  other Pattern Silver. It was one thing to work with another organization, but  these skimpily dressed girls were vigilantes. However, Stillwater reminded  himself that they were not complete amateurs. They had taken on several threats  that, while often absurd looking, were dangerous. The senior agent also  reminded himself that they were integral to the plan and that they had plans of  their own.</p><p>Sailor Mars  looked at the man standing behind the desk. His eyes were a dark, almost brown,  green and both his hair and goatee were neatly trimmed. As she watched him  move, Rei got the impression that he prided himself on control.</p><p>"Please  sit," Stillwater said as he pointed to the two couches in the room. "I'd  like to start by thanking you for finding that cabin. You must have had pretty  good scanners to find them. We had been looking for them..." Stillwater trailed  off.</p><p>"Actually,  Pluto told us about the cabin," Sailor Moon admitted as she sat on the  couch to the left.</p><p>"I  see," Stillwater said. From Murdock's reports, Pluto seemed to be a  dedicated but aloof and paranoid person.</p><p>"Aren't  you going to ask how she knew about it?" Sailor Mars asked.</p><p>"I'm  sure it had something to do with Murdock," Stillwater stated.</p><p>"How  did you know?" Sailor Moon asked.</p><p>"It's  always Murdock isn't it?" Stillwater said flatly.</p><p>"What  do you know of him?" Sailor Moon asked.</p><p>"That  he has an interest in all the Pattern Silvers, including Ranma. We also have  some evidence of Murdock meeting with various entities and cults associated  with Pattern registering entities."</p><p>"Was  he at the school today?" Sailor Moon asked. At the time, she had a strong  feeling that he was there.</p><p>"It is  possible. You weren't the only ones watching," Stillwater said simply.</p><p>"He  could have been watching from one of those office buildings that overlooks the  school," Sailor Mercury proposed.</p><p>"Or  maybe he was closer," Sailor Moon said as a sliver of memory hit her. In  the crowd outside the security perimeter, one of the other transfer students  ran into another one. It was a little thing - a gesture, a wave, a small  expression, and then it was gone. At the time it meant nothing, but that was  before she had met Murdock.</p><p>"What's  wrong?" Sailor Mars asked, concerned that the blonde had spaced out.</p><p>"Nothing,"  Sailor Moon said, shaking her head. Rei's interruption had caused Usagi to lose  her train of thought.</p><p>"Anything  else you'd like to ask?" Stillwater offered.</p><p>"What's  going on with Ranma?" Sailor Jupiter asked.</p><p>"Ranma's  a young man that turns into a demonic Senshi." Stillwater would have  preferred to say Pattern Silver and D Class 10, but the girls would likely not  know the terminology. "Due to an incident during his activation, he feels  betrayed. Ranma is cautious but willing to combat evil," Stillwater  stated, his voice precise and clear.</p><p>"We  already knew that," Sailor Moon countered.</p><p>Stillwater  nodded before speaking. "Then we're on the same page. We have to try and  earn Ranma's trust."</p><p>"Why  do you want him to work with you?" Sailor Mercury asked, meeting the man's  disturbingly focused gaze.</p><p>"Same  reason you want him with you. We're all here for the same reason," the  Commander stated. "Unfortunately, Ranma is suspicious of ulterior motives  from everyone."</p><p>"He  blames Pluto when Murdock's the one who did it."</p><p>"That  is what Ranma thinks." Stillwater's precise tone changed slightly. It  sounded almost as if he was disappointed.</p><p>"What  about our identities?" Sailor Venus asked, speaking for the first time.</p><p>Stillwater  responded after a slight pause. He had sent two agents to specifically address  that issue. "Until today, we only had suspicions as to who you were."  He did not say just how certain those suspicions were. "Remember that,  someone else had figured out who you were before us. We still do not know who  those Youma were working for, and now there's this group that you just  eliminated."</p><p>"You're  saying we should be on our guard," Sailor Moon observed.</p><p>"Our  offer for protection still stands," Stillwater stated.</p><p>"No  thanks."</p><p>The agent  nodded as he pressed a button on his phone. The door opened and an agent  stepped into the office. Still in his body armor, the man had taken off his  helmet, goggles, and balaclava. "If there's nothing else," Stillwater  said to the girls. "Lieutenant Patterson will make arrangements to get you  back home."</p><p>Stillwater  watched them leave the room. He feared that the girls would ask to see footage  of DarkStar's combat. Seeing a demon viscously rip apart and burn tens of  human-looking creatures might have caused problems. The agent shook his head.  There were several calls to be made and a fair bit of video footage to go over.</p><p>Operations  Centre 3 was located on the island of   Hokkaido roughly between the cities  of Sapporo and Tonakomai. Situated  a few miles outside the small city of Eniwa, the compound was built on a several  thousand aces of pastureland. Slightly smaller than the Kansas facility, the  complex centered on a cluster of concrete and steel buildings that resembled a  particularly ugly school campus.</p><p>Ranma  sighed as the elevator doors closed and the device began a controlled descent. Large  enough to fit a good sized truck, the freight elevator was empty save for himself,  his fiancee, and Jacob.</p><p>He was relieved  that the demon girl was staying with Kasumi's flunkies. Ranma knew where they  were - it was a ground floor lounge in an oval shaped building. However, he had  no idea where he was. He had followed Jacob and Kasumi through a maze of  corridors and checkpoints.</p><p>Ranma  looked up at display over the door. It was on SL14. Their destination was  sub-level twenty-seven. Ranma turned to his companions. Both were silently looking  at the doors.</p><p>The  elevator then stopped and Ranma expected a harsh buzzer or a computerized  female voiced to precede the opening of the doors, instead there was a happy  pinging noise that came before the two pairs of metal doors slid open.</p><p>Ranma stepped  out of the elevator to find himself in an intersection of two hallways. The one  to the front of him was large enough to drive a truck through and had to be at  least a couple hundred yards in length. The one to his right side was a little  under a third that length, but it ended into a sturdy, armored door. Ranma  could see a group of agents talking near the end of that corridor.</p><p>The  subterranean level followed the same design methodology that would be found  elsewhere in the Company. Concrete, steel, and, various polymers were the  primary materials. It was clear that functionality and security were their  primary concerns.</p><p>"Come  on," Jacob said as he walked past Ranma. He and Kasumi were already  walking down the longer corridor. Ranma followed them to a pair of oversized  double doors. Labeled next to the door was a sign with the words, "SL27-15  Materials Lab A." Jacob opened the door on the left and motioned for Ranma  and Kasumi to wait in the hall.</p><p>Major  Saotome was at her computer. It was located in a corner of the lab that served as  her office. She was sitting with a peripheral view of the door. Two of her subordinates  were inspecting armor that had been damaged in the field. Aida was still going  over the fire damaged armor from WIC Germany while Ayami was working on a set  that had just come in from a newly opened Company facility.</p><p>She had a  particular interest in that armor. A key scientist in its design, she was  interested in how that model survived. Unfortunately, Commander Akagi had told  her to expect a meeting from Command today. Not wanting to delay the inspection  of the body armor, the major reluctantly decided to allow her subordinate to go  over it.</p><p>The woman  was vaguely nervous. Unexpected visits from Command were rarely pleasant. The  major knew that she had nothing to worry about. Her record was clean, but there  was some slight anxiety.</p><p>There was  another factor. The fragmented information about her son was another concern. She  feared that the two events were related. That the agent from Command would tell  her that they were unable to get to her child in time, that Ranma had been  contaminated, and had to be put down. The woman sighed as she continued reading  the report on rotor blade fatigue. Such thoughts were counterproductive, at  least during work hours.</p><p>She then  heard the door being unlocked. Nodoka automatically moved her hand nearer to  her sidearm. She would have been pleased to know that her two assistants had  had similar ingrained reactions. The door opened and an older gentleman walked  in. The four-lobed silver leaf on his collar gave him a rank of Colonel and the  black trim of his uniform marked him as Operations Section.</p><p>"Hello  Colonel," Nodoka said as she saluted. Jacob returned the salute before  speaking. "Major Nodoka Saotome, what you're about to be told is classified  level six,"</p><p>Nodoka  nodded. She then turned to her assistants. "Aida, Ayami, go out and pick  up some lunch."</p><p>Jacob  waited for the two younger agents leave. "Major, this is your son Ranma"  the senior agent said.</p><p>The woman  paused as she looked at the two people entering the room. One was a reserved  and competent looking woman with the black trim of Operations Section and the  silver bars of a lieutenant. More importantly was the other teen to enter the  room. She recognized him immediately.</p><p>Ranma looked  at the woman. Her relatively short auburn hair was held back behind her head. The  woman's face resonated within his memory. Her eyes were strangely evaluative in  the second before she stood up, walked over to Ranma, and embraced him.</p><p>"My  son! At long last, it's been too long," Nodoka mumbled as she continued to  hug her son.</p><p>Ranma  accepted the hug, but it was somewhat uncomfortable. Unsurprisingly, under the  lab coat Major Saotome wore over the standard Company uniform was a rather  large handgun. As it was currently positioned, it dug slightly into Ranma.</p><p>Nodoka  broke of the hug and looked at her son. "So how did they find you? Where  were you?"</p><p>"Pops  took us to Canada. Then she saw me," Ranma said as he pointed to Kasumi,  who was silently standing near Jacob. "After that, she tried to kill  me."</p><p>"Really?"  Nodoka responded. Why would the Company do something crazy like that?</p><p>"Technically  that's not correct, ma'am. The operation was called off due to new information  becoming apparent," Kasumi said slightly insulted. She was not the kind of  person to merely <i>try</i> something. She  did it.</p><p>"Who  are you?" Nodoka politely asked the younger woman.</p><p>"Lieutenant  Tendo, Kasumi, ma'am. It was my operation."</p><p>"Is  your father's name Soun?" Nodoka asked. After getting an affirmative  response she continued. "So the bastard did go to him, but Soun was one of  the first people the Company interviewed. He said that Genma hardly ever talked  to him. He even let the agents make copies of the few postcards that had been  sent. I'm guessing you maintained surveillance on him and picked up Ranma when  he arrived there."</p><p>"Our  surveillance was in the form of a mutual acquaintance of yours. Someone who  already knew the involved parties," Jacob stated. He found it interesting  how certain events kept coming back to that man.</p><p>"The  Drake," Nodoka stated with a bitter laugh. "You know, he was the one  to suggest that I use the Company to find you," the woman said to her son.</p><p>"I  know him. He's the principal of the school I'm at," Ranma said with distaste.</p><p>"Oh,  so he finally got that plan off," Nodoka noted.</p><p>"Actually,  the Drake had yet to inform us to Ranma's impending arrival. We are looking  into certain inconsistencies involving his recent actions."</p><p>"Oh, then  what did happen?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>Kasumi  looked at Jacob who nodded. She then began to explain. Kasumi watched the older  woman's face as she talked. The major was admirably in control. The only times  the researcher gave off even the slightest reaction was during the rambling  explanation of Jusenkyou her estranged husband gave.</p><p>"So,  your father took you to an H-Type location and got you an aquatransexual curse.  Then a Pattern Silver asked you join their team to replace someone recently  assassinated, most likely by this Murdock person. The transfer then ended up  turning you into a demonic magical girl," Nodoka stated, looking at her  son. Her voice was even, but her eyes were intensely focused. The situation had  just gone from joyous to surreal.</p><p>"Yeah,"  Ranma admitted, a little disturbed by his mother. What did the Company do to its  employees?</p><p>"May I  see it?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"I  guess," Ranma stated. He was not too concerned that she might shoot him. The  woman was his mother after all.</p><p>Jacob  reached into his pocket and pulled out a phone. He then linked with the Command  and Control Center for Operations Centre 3 (WIC Japan). "This is Colonel  Edwards. Please be ready for those two spikes. Yes. We're in SL27, Room 15,  Building Epsilon. Good."</p><p>Ranma  walked past several examination tables filled with equipment that was neatly  organized to find a sink near several shelves filled with books and other  information storage devices. The far end of the room possessed what looked to  be a fair sized storeroom and a small machine shop. He placed his hand under  the faucet and opened the valve.</p><p>As Nodoka  watched the transformation, her hand immediately went to her sidearm. There was  something <i>unnatural</i> about the  pale-skinned redhead in the tight leather dress. The voluptuous young woman her  son had turned into was indeed a Pattern D.</p><p>Ranma  sighed as she looked at the agents' reactions. They had all reached for their  guns. Kasumi and Jacob were better at hiding it. Ranma could only see the  slightest twitches in their hands, but it was there. She shook her head,  causing her mass of unbound crimson tresses to cascade around her.</p><p>"My  god," Nodoka said as she walked over to the young demon. "Why would a  Pattern Silver turn you into this?"</p><p>Ranma  smiled sourly showing off slightly elongated canines. "This isn't what she  wanted me for." The redhead decided that she might as well show her the  final form.</p><p>Nodoka  frowned at the girl's expression. She then noticed that her child's eyes had  changed. There were now noticeable violet flecks mixed in with the blue of  Ranma's eyes. "I suppose that you have another more powerful form. One  that no doubt involves ribbons and a miniskirt," Nodoka said with bitter  humor.</p><p>"You  know about the Sailor Senshi?" the redhead asked with some surprise. Ranma  thought it was all a secret.</p><p>"When  the Pattern Silvers became more numerous and active in Tokyo, the Company decided  to conduct some surveillance on them. The observers also recovered some items  leftover from their fights. It was mostly piles of a gritty somewhat complex  compound that varied from sample to sample and but had a roughly constant  Pattern residue. However, sometimes the Forensic Pathology teams recovered a  shard of crystal," Nodoka explained in a professional and interested voice</p><p>"I was  the one to examine those objects. Most of them had a fairly quick half-life and  disintegrated into their base components before a full analysis could be conducted.  Footage of Pattern Silvers was part of my briefing."</p><p>"Wait.  If you guys knew about the Senshi that long ago, why are you only now trying to  talk to those girls?" Ranma asked Jacob.</p><p>"The  Japanese government forbid us from conducting operations within fifty miles of  Tokyo, but they normally ignored us as long as we only observed and did not  create an obvious presence" Jacob stated.</p><p>"Like  having dozens of military vehicles in the streets and armed helicopters flying  overhead?" Ranma inquired.</p><p>"That  would be it. Because we were not allowed to make contact with them, we did not  learn of their importance. That is until certain events happened. Such as Murdock  coming forward to tell us what he knew," Jacob explained.</p><p>"And  what did Murdock tell you?" Ranma asked as she stared intently at the  agent.</p><p>"According  to him, the same things he told you after you left Seattle," Jacob replied  as he maintained eye contact with the tall redhead.</p><p>"Sir?"  Nodoka interjected. "About my son's other form."</p><p>"Fine,"  Ranma said as she glared at Jacob. Part of her suspected that the man was  telling the truth, and that the Company was as much in the dark as everyone  else was, but another part of her feared that WIC knew much more than it let  on. One thing she knew for certain there was no way she could get the  information out of Jacob. Not here at least. If she laid one finger on him, the  Company would likely send everything they had to try and stop her. Ranma did  not want to consider what kind cataclysmic paranoia induced response would  happen in that event.</p><p>Ranma  paused to glare at Jacob and activated the transformation. Bands of violet,  crimson, and black energy encased the girl. When they died down she was wearing  an incredibly short black leather miniskirt, a violet bikini top with dark  purple and red bows and ribbons, and knee-high, five-inch heeled, black leather  boots.</p><p>Her hair  was longer, had even more body, and had dark purple highlights. Her choker was  black as was the stone in her golden tiara and the stones in her earrings. She  also had even longer canines, a pair of little black horns, a three foot long  spade shaped tail and a pair of large dragon-like wings. Her eyes had also  turned completely amethyst</p><p>"Well,  that's a change in design," Nodoka commented. She took a deep breath and  maintained her calm. It took most of her training to do this. The demonic  influence of the girl was beyond obvious, yet the young woman was still her  son. Thoughts of contamination were pushed aside. NH's working for the Company  was rare, but not unheard of, and if she was being escorted by agents from  Operations Section, she had to be clean.</p><p>In Toronto,  a street car drove down Dundas Street. It was a fair sized avenue that was  roughly between the Canada National Tower and the University of Toronto and ran  parallel to the lake. The tracked mass transit car stopped at the where the  road intersected with Saint Patrick Street. A man in a dark brown trench coat  and a wide brimmed fedora used this opportunity to disembark.</p><p>Quickly  crossing the street, he made his way to the sidewalk. Once there, he tightened  the ties on his coat and flipped up his collar. The rain was coming down quite  heavily and he did not want to get completely soaked. The man looked out from  under the brim of his hat to see his destination. It was a small pub a couple  hundred feet from his current location.</p><p>The arched  letters painted on the front window proclaimed it to be the Red Turtle. Drawn  below the bar's name was a drawing of that crimson reptile. The creature's  knowing expression brought a smile to the man's face as he looked into the  establishment.</p><p>The Red  Turtle was paneled in polished hardwood and trimmed with simple but skillfully  crafted moldings. The bar gave off warm, sturdy sense of comfort and stability,  which was only magnified by the downpour. Powerful gusts of wind had made the  precipitation even more unpleasant.</p><p>The pub  appeared to be a place that had stood for decades and would continue to stand  for decades more, each night providing the same service to the same group of  regulars. The man was now using his left hand to hold down his hat, preventing  it from blowing away.</p><p>The bar  itself was a heavy construct of oak and brass and looked to be older than the  city itself. Sitting at the end furthest from the window was a tanned woman  with vibrant green hair. Her head was down to where it nearly touched the aged  wood. The man smiled when he saw that she was there and he quickly made his way  inside.</p><p>As he took  of his coat and hat and gingerly placed them on a coat rack near the door, he  started to hum. Few would recognize the tune. It was the theme song to a short-lived  cartoon that chronicled the fictionalized adventures of a Rhode Island horror  writer. The man walked past the scattered patrons of the pub and over to the  woman at the far side of the bar.</p><p>She looked  up when he was eight feet away. Recognition darkened her face as the woman  watched him approach. The man was wearing an expensive suit that would have  looked quite good on the man, except for one thing. It was rather rumpled. Even  his tie's knot was not done quite right, "Hello Murdock. Come here to gloat?  Or maybe you just want to babble incoherent riddles to me?" she asked  coldly. Even his tie clasp, a silver bar with strange symbols that were either  occult or mathematical etched on it, was crooked.</p><p>Murdock  looked at the woman and sighed. "You know, I was going to just  congratulate you on your girls' performance yesterday, but now I'm just  disappointed," the man stated as he sat down. The runic mage then  proceeded to order an especially dark German beer.</p><p>As if she  had just heard something particularly incomprehensible, Setsuna shook her head.  Murdock noted this as he took a sip of his drink. The Time Guardian then went  back to nursing her Manhattan.</p><p>"If it  was up to me, I'd leave right now, but I have my orders," Murdock  admitted.</p><p>"Like  when you tormented Usagi?"</p><p>"All I  did was direct her attention to an important issue. I presume you were forced  to tell her the truth."</p><p>Setsuna  looked at the man, her face neutral.</p><p>"They're  not going to like you lying to them. They can handle the truth."</p><p>"This  coming from <i>you</i>?" Setsuna asked,  horribly annoyed.</p><p>"You  don't think you're better than me?" Murdock asked as he straightened his  tie clip. "It's really bad when people find a secretive organization with questionable  motives is more forthcoming than other members of their own team."</p><p>The woman  took another sip.</p><p>Murdock  sighed as he took another drink. "I'm surprise at how much you botched up  Sailor DarkStar. You just ran away. What, were you afraid of being sexually  assaulted by a demonic redhead?"</p><p>"It  surprised me."</p><p>"Now,  you're just lying. You knew of Ranma's curse. You knew what the original  DarkStar looked like. You should have seen it coming."</p><p>"Well,  you've taken steps against that, haven't you?"</p><p>"Because  events aren't neatly flowing from one point to another, you're blaming me? You  act as if I could simply raise the Reynolds number of the time stream and turn  that nice predicable laminar flow into something turbulent."</p><p>"Are  you done?" Setsuna asked as she ordered another drink.</p><p>"I  guess," Murdock stated. He then drank his beer in silence. The red-eyed  woman then received her drink. They spent the next two hours without talking as  they sipped their beverages.</p><p>In the end  it was Murdock who paid his tab and left first.</p><p>"Sunshine  Saotome?" Nodoka asked in a very confused voice.</p><p>"Damn,  fucking Drake," Ranma swore as he followed his mother. When they left  Nodoka's lab, Jacob wandered off taking Kasumi with him.</p><p>According  to the signs on the walls, they were in SL-14, corridor 3B, but that was  meaningless to Ranma. All he knew was that they were going back to that lounge.  From there they would go to the hanger.</p><p>"Yes,  the Drake does love his jokes. Although now, I'm afraid he's gotten over his  head," Nodoka chuckled.</p><p>"Yeah,  I'm going to shave that bastard's mullet right off."</p><p>"That  is if the Company doesn't get to him first," the older woman said coldly.</p><p>"I  thought he worked with them?"</p><p>"Yes,  and he knew we were looking for you. He told you that Genma contacted him a  week before you two arrived in Toronto. And yet he does not tell us who you  are? The Company takes missing persons cases rather seriously."</p><p>"Didn't  he tell Jacob?"</p><p>"No.  Colonel Edwards found out about the search I had running after that incident  with your fiancee. He ran your name and that came up."</p><p>"Why  am I not surprised," Ranma muttered as they rounded a corner and entered  yet another corridor. "So what'll happen to him?"</p><p>"They'll  interrogate him, and if they find out that he betrayed the Company, well that's  it," Nodoka said simply.</p><p>Ranma  remained silent for a few seconds. "What about Pops?" he then asked.</p><p>"What  he did was criminal. The exact punishment has yet to be determined,"  Nodoka stated as her pupils contracted and her hand moved to rest on her  sidearm.</p><p>The martial  artist's eyes widened in comprehension. He now knew why his mother was so  accepting of what he did as DarkStar. His mother, like almost all Company  agents, seemed disturbingly familiar with death.</p><p>"Your  father is at fault for what happened to you, but some of the blame can go to  me. I might have been able to stop him, but I let him take you. It was only  when he failed to return that I began to worry. I had no idea what he was doing  with you and only sketchy reports that you were even still alive," the  major confessed.</p><p>"But  no matter how much we regret our past decisions, we can't go back. There's only  the present. That's why I work for the Company. I do what I can to pay for my  mistakes. My developments have saved the lives of at least two hundred agents,"  Nodoka stated in a melancholy yet prideful tone.</p><p>"At  least Lieutenant Tendo seems like a nice Company girl," Nodoka stated in  an attempt to redirect the subject at hand. She then smiled. "I wonder if  Genma has the slightest clue."</p><p>"She  pointed a gun at me. There's nothing going on between us," Ranma said  flatly.</p><p>"You  two are somewhat young, but at least you're engaged to a professional,"  Nodoka stated as they entered and elevator. It was a quick ride up a couple of  floors. The corridor that the lift arrived at was rather familiar to Ranma.</p><p>"Oh,  we're back," Ranma said with some dread. He had wanted to avoid this, but  he had no choice.</p><p>One metal  door in the corridor was open. It lead to a smallish room with a couple  couches, a kitchenette, a table, a pair of televisions, and a computer station.  From within the room came a black and white blur. A rather pale girl with  black, violet highlighted, hair in and dressed in skimpy black clothes had  tried to tackle and embrace Ranma.</p><p>"Stop  doing that! You damn stupid freak!" Ranma shouted after he dodged the  demoness.</p><p>"But  mistress, I really missed you," the demon said in a voice that might have  been seductive, if Ranma did not know who the creature had been before.</p><p>Ranma shook  his head. "Why couldn't that damn water have worked on you?"</p><p>Nodoka  looked at the young girl. Her eyes, a strange color of red, and other factors,  notably calling her son mistress, lead the agent to her conclusion. "You  spawned?" There was another option, but her son would never do that, not  if he wanted to live.</p><p>"Actually,  DarkStar converted her," Jacob said as he entered the hallway from the  lounge. "It was a life or death situation and I Okayed the decision."</p><p>"Of  course sir," Nodoka said as she looked at the little NH in understanding. Her  son had saved a girl mortally wounded when those Pattern Ys took over that  school. "Now Ranma, you shouldn't be so mean to her. The girl's just  trying to show her appreciation. You should know what it's like to be in her  place."</p><p>"You  have no idea," Ranma grumbled, eyeing the Kuno girl.</p><p>"I'd  hate to interrupt but your flight is ready," Jacob stated.</p><p>"Okay,"  Ranma said before turning to his mother.</p><p>"Don't  worry, I'll see you on you're way back, and I'll look into getting some  leave," the woman said with a strange glint in her eye.  Jacob noticed this and reminded himself that  he would have to warn the major that vengeance had to be taken through proper  channels.</p><p>"Um,  all right," Ranma stated.</p><p>Over the  Sea of Japan, Jacob dialed a number into his phone.  After his encryption system synchronize with  that of his caller, he spoke.   "We're on our way to the final base."</p><p>Over six  and a half thousand miles away, Commander Stillwater responded.<br/>"Good, how did the meeting go?"</p><p>"Adequately.  A petition for transfer may be a result from that meeting." Jacob stated  somewhat quietly.  Ranma was reading near  the front of the plane and the senior agent was at the opposite end in the  back.</p><p>"I  see.  I'll go over her file.  When can I expect her request?"</p><p>"Shortly,"  Jacob responded.</p><p>"Okay.  What about the three stooges?"</p><p>"That  is a troubling issue," Jacob admitted.    "They are all closely tied  to our organization.  At least one of them  seems to be without blame. A thorough investigation will be needed."</p><p>"Agreed,  and once that is done penalties can be decided."</p><p>"At  least with one of them a family <i>solution</i>  can be arranged," Jacob stated.</p><p>"Perhaps  with the others as well."</p><p>"Perhaps.  Any information on those Pattern Ys from the  school and the Vs from the cabin."</p><p>"Nothing  on the Vs, but we have found the motel rooms where the Ys were staying.  Forensic teams are going over them now."</p><p>"Good.  Do we have clearance to our final destination?"</p><p>"Yes.  Command was quite annoyed with that request,"  Stillwater smirked.  "You know what  we had to do to get our helicopters into China?</p><p>"I'm  sure our negotiators explained the recent rise in NH activity in their  nation," Jacob stated as he smiled slightly.</p><p>"Not  to mention the sensitivity of the base you plan to use as a staging area."</p><p>"Ranma  has already been inside WIC Japan and WIC America."</p><p>"And  he was never in one of the more sensitive areas," Stillwater cautioned.</p><p>"Not  nearly as risky as what our plans for the Pattern Silvers are," Jacob replied.</p><p>"Just  remember to keep him away from the dig site."</p><p>"If we  could use a different base to stage the mission from I would, but that site is  the closest one we have to Jusenkyou.   The next nearest one is five hundred miles further out."</p><p>"Still,  discretion is recommended.  If the  Pattern Silvers knew what we had found in the Gobi, it might cause  problems," Stillwater cautioned.</p><p>"It's  not what we found. It's what we're planning to do with it," Jacob replied  with distaste.</p><p>"That issue has already been  decided," Stillwater stated, ending the discussion.</p><p>Based on  the  position of Polaris, Ranma knew that  he was facing southwest, but the predawn view was the same no matter what  direction he was facing.  All around the  Company Field Command Post was the barren land of southern Mongolia.  The nearest city, Dalandzadgad, was just  below the northern horizon.</p><p>Ranma had  no clear idea why the Company had a base here.   Jacob had said something about a salvage operation being conducted at the  request of the Mongolian government.  The  nearest WIC facility to Jusenkyou, the base was a small cluster of mobile  buildings positioned on a tarmac next to an abandoned airstrip. The actual  salvage site was a few miles to the east.</p><p>"The helicopters  should be ready in under half an hour," Kasumi said once she had walked  over to her fiance.</p><p>"Good.  Hopefully, I'll be rid of this damn demon,"  Ranma stated.  He knew that Jusenkyou was  his best hope at getting cured.</p><p>[End chapter 5]</p><p>Author's notes:  Prereaders  for this chapter at Starfire, Fenton, Wray, and Black Dragon.</p>
