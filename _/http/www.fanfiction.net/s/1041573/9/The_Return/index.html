</div><p>The Return</p><p>A Ranma Sailor Moon fic thingy.</p><p>By Josh Temple</p><p>Naturally, I own neither Sailor Moon nor Ranma. So here's  the disclaimer</p><p>Ranma 1/2 and its characters and settings belong to Rumiko  Takahashi, Shogakukan, Kitty, and Viz  Video. Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon belongs to Naoko  Takeuchi, Koudansha, TV Asahi, and Toei Douga, and DiC.</p><p>Previous chapters and other works  can be found at my website.</p><p>C&amp;C as always is wanted.</p><p>Chapter 8 Recreation and Retribution</p><p>"I've  got news," Setsuna said after her princess sat down in the passenger seat  of her car.</p><p>"Good  or bad?" Usagi asked after buckling into the green 1974 Dodge Charger.</p><p>"Complicated,"  the green-haired woman said as she engaged a forward gear.</p><p>"Orion?"  the blonde asked, referring to the newest Sailor Senshi.</p><p>The  older woman looked contemplative for a moment. "Not yet. It's about  Sunshine," she stated as she drove them through an avenue.</p><p>"Ranma?"  Usagi half asked and half corrected. She was finding it somewhat hard to even  think of that redheaded demoness as being male.</p><p>"No...  this time it's definitely Sunshine," Setsuna sighed. She then concentrated  on merging into the highway traffic.</p><p>Usagi  recalled that dream of hers, the one with Queen DarkStar and her... entourage.  "What happened? What did she do?" she asked, fearing the response.</p><p>"Sunshine  has converted two humans. They are now demons in her brood."</p><p>"God,"  Usagi gasped as the color drained from her face.</p><p>"It's  not that bad. They were both dying. It was the only way she could save  them," Setsuna explained as she shifted into the left lane.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"When  a person is turned into a demon, their body is dramatically altered. Healing is  a side effect of the conversion process," Meiou explained.</p><p>"So  in order to save their lives, she <i>had</i>  to turn them," Usagi noted with hollowness in her voice. The story made  sense but there was something <i>off</i>  about it.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Who  did she turn?"</p><p>"Akane  Tendo and Tatewaki Kuno."</p><p>"Kuno?"  Usagi asked to herself. That name was familiar to her. "Oh god, Nariko. So  <i>that's</i> how Sunshine saved her."</p><p>"Yes.  It happened when those youma attacked the school."</p><p>"I  see," Usagi said. "Wait. Wasn't Kuno a guy before?" the blonde asked.  She distinctly remembered that Tatewaki was a guy.</p><p>"Sunshine,"  Pluto reminded.</p><p>"Oh  yeah," Usagi replied, in a distant voice. Another part of that dream had  come true. She had to make sure that the rest of it never did.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>The  redhead gazed happily at the two young demonesses. After she had gotten up to  go to the bathroom, the two girls had moved closer to each other, filling the  spot where their mother had lain. They then entwined each other in a tight  embrace.</p><p>After  summoning her leather dress and boots, she walked over to the medical bed where  her two daughters were sleeping. She knew what she had to do, but she was still  unsure of how to do it. As Ranma watched the two sleep, a plan formed in her  mind. The demoness would need some help with it, but she knew who would be  willing to help her.</p><p>She  looked at a clock mounted on the wall and decided it was time to get her  children up. Gently pushing the girls she woke them up.</p><p>Akane's  eyes fluttered open. She smiled at the sight of her mother's face. Noticing who  she was laying next to, she kissed her mate as the red-eyed demoness woke up.</p><p>"Get  dressed you two," Ranma said, softly.</p><p>"Do  I have too?" Akane pouted. She found clothing to be to constrictive...</p><p>"Yes,  we're guests here and our hosts would rather we stay dressed," the girl's  mother explained.</p><p>"Yes,  meat bags don't like being naked," Nariko said, casually. She had spent a  fair bit of time around humans.</p><p>A  small growl escaped the redhead's mouth as her eyes flared violet. "NEVER  use that slur!" the demoness chastised her older child. "Not only is  it insulting to every human, but also to your whole family. Your grandmother's  human. I'm part human. You and your mate WERE human. I will NOT stand for such  language," Ranma explained, her voice stern and commanding.</p><p>"I'm  sorry Mommy," Nariko whimpered. <i>Mommy's  mad at me.</i> The girl recoiled, pulled her knees up to her chest, and tried  to hide within her wings. She found that they were being held back. One was  being held by her mate another by her mother.</p><p>Akane's  glance alternated between at the two women. She comforted Nariko, but she knew  that Mother was right. Their humanity was important.</p><p>"I  didn't want to yell at you, but it's important that you understand,"  Sunshine said as she sat down on the edge of the bed and held the girl.</p><p>"About  humans?" Nariko asked, her mood brightening.</p><p>"Yes,  now get dressed. We can get some breakfast," Ranma said.</p><p>Nariko  nodded and summoned a dark red leather dress. Strapless and hanging at just above  her chest, the dress was short and went her mid thigh with slits on either  side. She was also wearing a pair of calf-high red leather boots that were a  bit more feminine than her mother's despite having a slightly lower heel.  Nariko's version had more pointed toes, a narrower heel, and some fringe  decorations.</p><p>Akane  shrugged and tried so generate some clothing. She was soon wearing a pair of  little dark blue leather shorts and a light blue leather top that exposed her  midriff. It had a simple collar that transitioned to a plunging neckline.  Instead of shoulder straps the top wrapped around the back of her neck before  coming down her back and connecting back to her top. Akane was wearing a set of  simple, unadorned ankle-high blue-black leather wedge-heeled boots.</p><p>Ranma  ruefully smiled at Akane's skills. She was proud that Akane was willing to wear  clothing for her mother, and that she figured out how to generate clothing.  Something that she herself still had trouble with.</p><p>The  trio of demonesses then left the medical room. As they walked down the  corridor, the agent positioned at the door called his commanding officer.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>Because  she was a recent transfer and permanent housing had not been assigned for her,  Major Saotome was sleeping on a cot in one of the barracks rooms in WIC  Toronto-A. A subordinate agent from Operations Section woke her.</p><p>"Yes,  Lieutenant?" a somewhat bleary-eyed Nodoka asked. The first thing she did  was ascertain the rank of the person waking her up.</p><p>"They're  up, Ma'am," Kasumi stated.</p><p>The  older woman nodded and got up. "Early," she noted. It was before five  in the morning.</p><p>"They  did go to sleep very early," Kasumi noted.</p><p>Nodoka  nodded. She then got out of her cot and put on a fresh uniform with the dark  green trim of Science and Technology Section. If she were in the US military  she would have pinned a set of gold oak leaves to her collar.</p><p>However  she was a major in Willard International Consulting, and therefore used a set  of paired silver bars to indicate her rank. As a separate organization with its  own history and traditions the Company's rank and symbol system was different  from a military rank system.</p><p>Her  lab coat then went over the gray uniform. The officer checked to make sure her  gun was loaded and secured.</p><p>"I'll  take you to them," Kasumi said.</p><p>The  two agents then walked through two hallways and entered the commissary. Nodoka  smiled slightly upon seeing the three demonesses. "Major,  Lieutenant," a voice from one of the corners of the room said.</p><p>The  two officers turned to see the Commander and the Colonel sitting at a  wall-mounted table. Behind the table was an aerial photograph of a half  constructed WIC Operations Centre Two, located near Stuttgart, Germany.</p><p>"Yes  Sirs," both Nodoka and Kasumi responded saluting.</p><p>"At  ease," Stillwater said after returning the salute. The commanding officer  of WIC operations in Toronto looked at his executive officer before continuing.  "Given the personal nature of yesterday's events and their relevance to  the Company, both of you have leave to spend time with your family,"  Stillwater stated in a guarded voice.</p><p>"We  feel that your presence would greatly benefit Miss Ranma and her  children," Jacob added before he took a sip of coffee.</p><p>"Thank  you Sir," Major Saotome replied.</p><p>"Same  goes for your sister."</p><p>Kasumi  nodded respectfully. Last night after her sister had fallen asleep, she and the  Colonel had gone over that day's events. Command had determined that the  lieutenant's actions were correct, given the circumstances.</p><p>"Dismissed,"  Stillwater then said. As he watched the two agents head towards their family,  Stillwater reflected on the path the Company had to take. He wished he could  have Jacob's sense of optimism when it came to this demonic brood, but he was a  more cautious man.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"What  was that about?" Ranma asked as the two older women sat down across from  her and her children.</p><p>"We  were just given permission to spend more time with you," Nodoka said with  a smile.</p><p>"That's  good," Ranma said before gently scolding Akane for eating too fast. She  turned to see that Nariko had learned table manners lesson from yesterday and  was conducting herself appropriately.</p><p>"I'm  sure she's very hungry," Nodoka observed.</p><p>"Yes.  I'm just thankful we can eat normal food," Ranma said.</p><p>"Your  species is omnivorous," the Major observed. "You shouldn't have any  problem with eating any type of food..."</p><p>"It  would certainly be a pain if we needed something more... exotic," Ranma  said hesitantly. She then remembering when she had killed those youma and  absorbed their energy. While being nice and filling, she felt that it was not  terribly necessary... yet.</p><p>"Well...  you were probably feeding them as you slept last night," Nodoka explained,  remembering what she knew of demonic biology.</p><p>The  redheaded-demoness recalled cuddling with her children. There was a sense of  warmth and security; there was also a gentle draining, a feeling that she was  nourishing them with sustenance that she had gathered, stored, and converted to  a more easily absorbed form. "It's like I was breastfeeding them,"  she said with more wonderment and much, much less horror than she had expected.</p><p>"So  Auntie Kasumi, you're a secret agent? That's cool," Akane observed as she  ate some bacon.</p><p>"Something  like that," Kasumi said as she forced herself to smile. To the untrained  eye, it looked like Akane had simply gotten extensions for her canines and dyed  her hair a light blue. However, Kasumi's eyes <i>were</i> trained; she could tell that her sister was no longer human  even without Akane manifesting attributes that were unique to demons.</p><p>The  agent justified what she made Nariko do the same way she justified failing to  immediately put two rounds through that demon's head. Kasumi could not let her  sister die. Now, Akane had a chance.</p><p>"I'm  sorry, but Akane was asking what this place was and what you do," Ranma  said, smiling at her daughters.</p><p>"It's  good that she's... inquisitive," Kasumi said, with greater relief than she  let on.</p><p>"Yes,"  the redhead said. She then turned to her mother. "Sorry for getting  distracted but I'd be honored to have your help." Ranma then turned back  to her fiancee. "Both of you."</p><p>"What  are you planning for today?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Oh,  I've got a few things in mind," Ranma said. "But first I have to go  to the bathroom," the redhead said with some annoyance. She had gone after  getting up in the middle of the night, but she needed to go again. Sometimes  her new biology irritated her.</p><p>"I'll  go too," Kasumi said standing up after her fiance. The two girls then left  the room.</p><p>"So  how are you two doing?" Nodoka asked her two granddaughters.</p><p>"Okay,"  Akane said looking out the door Mother had left through. That her mate and  grandmother were still here helped her, but she hoped Mother would be back  soon.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"We're  going after Alexia," Kasumi stated to her fiance as the two young women  walked the short distance that separated the commissary from the nearest  bathroom.</p><p>"Of  course," Sunshine replied. Her eyes flared with anger at the thought of  Alexia. That demoness had no respect for life, neither human nor demon. For  Alexia her children were nothing more than minions she could easily control.  She had sent Eclipse out on a suicide mission immediately after Akane had been  converted.</p><p>"I  thought so. The Company is putting its weight on this mission. Someone knew  enough about you and me to put together this plan."</p><p>"You  think it was Murdock?" Sunshine asked as she opened the bathroom door.</p><p>"It  could have been him. Or it could have been someone else. We'll find out,"  Kasumi promised as she followed the redhead into the bathroom. The two young  women then went into a pair of adjacent stalls.</p><p>As  Sunshine washed her hands, she gazed at her reflection. There was that  beautiful woman with crimson hair, pale skin, and blue and violet eyes. On an  impulse she increased the heat of the water being poured onto her hands.</p><p>The  person's form shifted to that of a male teenaged human. Ranma looked down at  his pants and sighed in relief. He was glad that he was wearing something when  he last activated his demon form.</p><p>Ranma  then smiled at his reflection. His eyes were still blue, he was still human.  His smile then faded. Something was wrong... something was missing. He could no  longer feel his children. That was another thought that confused him. In demon  form, the thought of having Akane and Nariko as kids seemed perfectly natural.  Now, it felt strange and alien.</p><p>Kasumi  looked quizzically at Ranma. His emotional state seemed to be confused and  muddled.</p><p>Ranma  sighed and put his hand under the sink while decreasing the water temperature.  The demoness looked at her reflection and sighed again. Kasumi was not able to  tell whether it was in fear or relief.</p><p>"You  okay?" the agent then asked.</p><p>"They  need a mother not a father," Ranma said staring at her reflection. "I  can't help them as a human."</p><p>"Let's  go back to them, then," Kasumi said after washing her hands.</p><p>The  demoness nodded and followed the agent out of the bathroom.</p><p>"I'm  amazed that you haven't been overwhelmed," Kasumi stated as they walked  down the hallway.</p><p>"Who's  to say that I haven't?" Ranma asked, in a darkly humorous voice.  "Ever since I admitted to Nariko that I was her mother I'd been going with  my instincts."</p><p>"And  since you've been in a demoness' body..." Kasumi proposed.</p><p>"Exactly,"  the mother sighed, as she ran a hand through her hair.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"What's  wrong?" Nodoka asked her two granddaughters. Both of the young demons'  eyes had gone wide with fright.</p><p>"Mommy's  gone!" Akane exclaimed.</p><p>Nariko  nodded. She could no longer feel mother's presence. Unlike the other times it  had happened, where their link had faded with increasing distance, now was a  sudden cut.</p><p>"Ranma  was going to the bathroom," Nodoka said trying to comfort the two. She was  about to inform the Commander when the two girls gave a confused, but happy,  pair of sighs.</p><p>"Is  she back?" Major Saotome asked.</p><p>Instead  of responding to their grandmother the two girls leapt over the table and ran  towards the commissary's entrance. They went straight to the redheaded woman  that had just entered the room. Both leapt into the air and clutched onto their  mother; Akane on the left and Nariko on the right.</p><p>Kasumi  blinked as the two bounding demons ran past her. She shook her head and made it  back to the table where her breakfast was. Her fiance was going to have an  interesting time raising those kids.</p><p>Agents  of Willard International Consulting had been trained to accept and combat the  unusual. However, the sight of a demonic brood mother comforting two of her  spawn, right in a Company commissary, was something new and strange.</p><p>"This  used to be a professional organization," Commander Marvin Stillwater  stated with a carefully neutral face.</p><p>"They're  just kids happy to see their mom," Jacob chuckled in reply.</p><p>The  senior officer paused to stroke his goatee as if he were in deep contemplation.  "So it would seem," Stillwater finally answered before resuming his  breakfast.</p><p>Jacob  smiled slightly.     It was a good sign  that Marv had a sense of humor about this.</p><p>Ranma's  attention was divided between her two children. "Yes?" she asked the  demonesses that were still clinging to her.</p><p>"You  turned into a human didn't you?" Nariko asked, worry on her face.</p><p>"We  couldn't feel you," Akane added.</p><p>Ranma  sighed and hugged her daughters. "It's okay; I shouldn't have worried you  like that."</p><p>"Please  don't go back to that icky form, Mommy," Nariko pleaded, her crimson eyes  large and scared. She had just gotten her mother back; she did not want to lose  her again.</p><p>"That  wasn't the first time you couldn't feel me," Ranma countered, still  holding her daughters close and soothing them.</p><p>"Yes  Mommy," Nariko said sighing in remembrance. Those first days had been so  hard for her. In a new body with new needs she was confused and alone. It was  only mother's presence that kept her from breaking down completely.</p><p>Akane  untangled herself from her mother and went to her mate. She wrapped her arm  around the taller girl. "It's not so much that we couldn't feel you. It's  just that it was so quick. We thought... we..." the blue-haired girl  uttered unable to complete the thought.</p><p>"It's okay," Ranma said as  she moved her kids back to the table where they were eating breakfast.  "I'll be more careful next time," the demoness promised as she  considered the implications of the event.</p><p>"Next  time?" Nariko asked in a worried voice.</p><p>"I'm  still part human, dear. That's who I am. Don't worry. I'll do it in front of  you. If it gets too scary, I can change right back," Ranma explained,  hoping that she would be able to avoid spending all of her time in demon form.</p><p>Nariko  whimpered slightly.</p><p>"It  wouldn't be so bad if we could still feel you," Akane suggested.</p><p>"I'll  see what we can do," Ranma promised.</p><p>Nodoka  smiled as she watched her child control the situation. It looked like Ranma was  handling herself well. The major finally noticed the leather shorts her  granddaughter was wearing. She knew of underwear that was less revealing than  the garment the blue-haired girl was wearing. They looked painted on and barely  were long enough to actually have leg sections. She shook her head and made a  note to talk to her daughter about Akane's tastes.</p><p>"Sorry  about that," Ranma apologized after she and her children had sat back  down.</p><p>"That's  okay," Nodoka reassured. "So what are you planning for today?"  the agent asked her daughter.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>A  pair of grey Company sedans stopped in front of a gate complex. After traveling  twenty miles on a roughly northern heading, the two vehicles had left the city  and were now in forested lands. The gatehouse straddled a tall length of  razor-wire topped fencing. Looking out from one of the sedans, Ranma was not  surprised to find that there was another fence several hundred feet within the  second.</p><p>"Let  me guess, WIC Toronto-B?" the redhead asked as their car was inspected by  a group of agents in nondescript grey work clothing.</p><p>"Yes,"  Kasumi replied while she kept her hands on the steering wheel. "This is  where we store and service our helicopters, maintain training facilities, and  have backup services."</p><p>"How  private is it?" Ranma asked after they were waved through the first  checkpoint.</p><p>"It's  private enough where we can do most of our helicopter maneuvers and execute  small simulations," Kasumi said as she pulled up to the second checkpoint  and deactivated the car. "Notice there's trees around most of the  property," the lieutenant then said, pointing at the trees on the inside  of the fence.</p><p>"Good.  I don't want to attract too much attention. I'd do this at home, but the  neighbors are too close," Ranma noted.</p><p>Kasumi  nodded and after a brief conversation with the agents guarding the gate drove  through and down the wooded path.</p><p>Despite  containing only human Company officers, the second car went though a similar  series of inspections. This vehicle was being driven by Agent First Class Aram Kowalski.  Major Nodoka Saotome sat next to him. Colonel Jacob Edwards sat in the back.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"Wow,  this place is actually... nice," Ranma said commenting as she looked at  the collection of buildings that made up the Company facility. Unlike the other  WIC bases she had been in, this one was made up of several tastefully designed  buildings, instead of ugly blocks of concrete, glass, and steel. The demoness  and her fiancee were standing on a large flagstone patio that connected two of  the buildings.</p><p>"Yes,  it was an unoccupied business park that the Company bought. I believe it used  to be the test site for a company that produced aviation engine controls,"  Kasumi explained as she parked the car. "The Drake got us a rather good  deal on it," the agent added before she unbuckled her seatbelt and opened  the door.</p><p>As  Ranma got up she thought back to what she knew of the Drake. The unbalanced  educator was more than a principal. He was also a trader in land and property.  It was a land deal that had gotten him and the Tendos into Toronto, and the  walls of his office were covered with photographs of properties he had bought  and sold. "I guess he's an important part of the Company," Ranma  observed.</p><p>Kasumi's  eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly. "Yes he has done much for WIC. So why  here? Why train them now?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"You  know what happened yesterday. I'm a target. So are the rest of you guys. So are  my kids," the redhead added.</p><p>"Yes,  Eclipse was ordered to kill all of us," Kasumi stated, her voice  emphasizing the name. She then looked to see Akane and her mate exiting the  back seat.</p><p>"And  Alexia's not the only one after us. The Assembly also wants kill us. Not to  mention whatever other enemies are out here," Ranma sighed.</p><p>"Like  that group of Pattern V's Lieutenant Patterson and the Senshi killed a couple  days ago."</p><p>Ranma  nodded. "I have to make sure they're able to defend themselves," the  redhead said as she looked at her children.</p><p>"You're  going to train us, Mommy?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Yes, dear."</p><p>"Ohh,  neat," Akane replied happily. Mother was a powerful demon; she had to be  knowledgeable and experienced.</p><p>Nariko  smiled. It had taken Mommy some time to realize what she was. Now Mommy was  taking care of the two of them. She idly ran her tongue on one of her fangs and  reached for Akane's hand. The other demon accepted the contact and returned the  grip.</p><p>"Come  on," Kasumi said as she escorted the three demons further into the WIC  facility. "I'll show you some of our training areas, but I suppose you're  more interested in aerial work," Lt. Tendo stated as they walked down one  of the paths that ran between the buildings.</p><p>"Yes,  first off is making sure they can fly. Then we can move into more complicated  moves."</p><p>"So  we can fly?" Akane asked, somewhat rhetorically. She remembered having  wings, but that was only after she had been first turned and when she was  trying to... kill Kasumi. The blue-haired demoness shuddered at the memories,  and tightened the hold she had on her mate's hand.</p><p>"Yes  we can," Ranma replied. She then sensed that something was off. "What  is it?"</p><p>"I'm  sorry Mommy, Auntie, Nari-chan. I didn't... I didn't mean to," Akane  choked out. She remembered the delight she felt at the prospect of murdering  her family. The demon closed her eyes and whimpered. "It wasn't me. I  didn't mean to-" Her speech was cut off by a tight embrace.</p><p>"You're  absolutely right," Ranma said as she hugged the smaller girl. "You  were just a puppet of that bitch Alexia.</p><p>"You're  free of her now," Kasumi said as she put a hand on her sister's shoulder.  The agent looked into brown eyes that were familiar yet alien.</p><p>"I  know, I've got Mommy and you to protect me," Akane said her spirits  lifting somewhat.</p><p>"Yes,"  Kasumi said as she got the demons walking forward again. "Now remember to  keep fairly low. If you get too high there's a chance someone outside of the  base could spot you," Kasumi warned.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"I  should go talk to my son," Major Saotome said as she watched the agent and  three demonesses walk away.</p><p>"After  this meeting if you will," Jacob stated.</p><p>"Of  course, Sir," Nodoka replied. "May I ask what it is?"</p><p>"Recently,  we came into possession of an interesting artifact. You might be able to help  us analyze its composition," the older man said.</p><p>"Why  is it here, and not in the A base?" the scientist asked. She suspected  that the artifact was too large to be studied in the main base.</p><p>"There  is some risk in its use. We have it powered down so it should be safe, but to  be cautious we have it out here," Jacob replied. He thought that it was a  bad idea to be experimenting with such an object, but Command was adamant. They  wanted inter-dim technology. It was one thing to be able to jam its use but  quite another to be able to use it.</p><p>"I  see," Nodoka replied as she was lead to the warehouse where the captured  gate was being analyzed.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>Ranma  looked around the field. She could see a forest, a cluster of buildings, and  several agents. The closest group was a squad of armored troops lounging around  a helicopter. Kasumi had told her that the Company maintained at least one team  near a helicopter for fast response at all times. They were close enough that  the redhead could hear their hushed conversation. Undoubtedly, they suspected  that she had superior hearing; their conversation <i>was</i> fairly clean.</p><p>"Now,  these girls know how to dress," Specialist Agent Morrison joked as  he watched the demonesses stretch.</p><p>"Careful  there Rich, those girls bite," Agent First Class Alfred Stevenson replied  as he looked them over.</p><p>"At  least they're not wearing demented school-girl uniforms like the others,"  Richard Morrison responded.</p><p>Ranma  gave a toothy grin to that. That was one advantage she had. Her uniform might  make her look like a bimbo, but it could have been worse.</p><p>"That's  true," Alfred replied. "Hey, Lieutenant what do you think?"</p><p>Lieutenant  Patterson had been watching the trio of demons with a neutral expression.  "This is not the first time we have had non-humans working with us, and  Command seems to think that we need the Pattern Silvers," the officer said  carefully.</p><p>Ranma  pulled her attention from the agents and went back to her kids. "Okay, I  really can't explain much of flying to you girls. It's just something you'll  have to do. Fortunately, your instincts should be a big help. So bring out your  wings."</p><p>Nariko  stretched and summoned her red horns, black and violet wings, and black tail  with violet fins. Her strapless dress had lowed its back to accommodate her  wings and had gained a small hole to allow for her tail. Consisting of a flap  and a clasp, the hole could be opened up to allow for her tail, and its fins,  to be pulled though.</p><p>Akane had  also summoned her demonic extras. Her top went around her neck and back in such  a way that it did not need to be modified for her blue and white wings.  Similarly her tail with white with blue fins was able to form above the top of  her tiny shorts.</p><p>"I  wonder," Ranma said as she closed her eyes. She knew that she could make  her wings and tail appear without going into DarkStar form. Hiding and showing  such demonic physiology was a basic power of her species. Both of her children  were capable of that minutes after they were converted.</p><p>Her leather dress changed, becoming backless  and gaining a hole at the base of her spine. The redhead's body then changed.  Small black horns grew into place on her head, her canines lengthened slightly,  her crimson and dark violet wings appeared, and her three-foot long tail with  violet spade-shaped fins formed into place.</p><p>"Mommy's  pretty," Akane said as she looked at her Mother's true form for the first  time.</p><p>"Umm  thanks, Honey," Ranma said as she swished her tail back and forth  nervously. At least this time the compliment on her physical form was not  sexual in nature.</p><p>"No,  you really are beautiful, Mommy. You shouldn't be embarrassed about it,"  Akane said.</p><p>"I  know," Ranma admitted. "Okay, you're going to want to start by  extending your wings," the redhead said as she began to instruct her  children.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>From his  seat on a flagstone patio that connected to nearby buildings, Jacob watched the  three demons flying through the air. It was clear that Ranma was the most  skilled but her children were quick to learn. Initially, they had been  unsteadily ascending and diving, but after some acclimation had learned to  properly use their wings and tails.</p><p>The agent  smiled. Their maneuvers reminded him of his childhood. Only Stillwater knew  that in his youth Jacob had been interested in falconry. He had even gone so  far as to take an apprenticeship for two years in order to obtain his license.  Jacob had considered following in his father's footsteps and becoming a  professional falconer.</p><p>There had  been something to raising and hunting with a powerful raptor. Jacob remembered  the lecture his father had given him before he had been given his hawk, a  beautiful Redtail named Rebecca.</p><p>"Always  remember that she is <i>not</i> your pet,  boy. She'll tear off a chunk of your flesh if you're not careful. You can't  tame her and if she doesn't like you, you can't train her, but if you work hard  you can teach and hunt with her," the elder Edwards recited in the WIC  officer's memory.</p><p>Jacob  grinned slightly as he traced a faint scar on the back of his right hand. His  father was right. It did not take long for him to slip up and end up with  Rebecca digging one of her talons into him.</p><p>His  attention returned to the brood of demons. They really were magnificent. Like  the raptors of his youth these were beautiful hunters, but with much greater  potential. Unlike his hawk, they did not just have their instincts; there was  intelligence to their actions. They were also much more lethal and powerful  than a simple bird of prey.</p><p>Jacob knew  from experience that this particular species of demon made for a dangerous  opponent, but he could also see how they would make for an extremely useful  ally, especially one that was a Pattern Silver as well.</p><p>The agent  knew that he had to tread carefully with Ranma. Ranma's reaction to  "taming" would be worse than any raptor's. The destruction was not  something Jacob wished to consider. Especially if one of her children were  threatened. Already, Ranma had become quite protective of her brood. It would  also be unwise to treat Ranma or her children as animals. They might be inhuman  but that did not mean that they were subhuman.</p><p>Fortunately,  his agents were following their orders and conducting themselves properly  around the brood. His main concern was the higher ups in Command, but having  the demon be a Pattern Silver went a long way with them. That Ranma was also  the <i>son</i> of a high ranking WIC officer  also helped.</p><p>Though  honestly, Jacob thought of Ranma as a demoness first and a human second, if at  all. He had started using male pronouns when referring to Ranma. Out of  deference to Ranma's preference, but as time passed and Jacob saw more of the  demon than the human his views on Ranma shifted. That Ranma was now the brood  mother to a pair of young demons reinforced this greatly.</p><p>The agent even harbored theories that Ranma's  human form was really just a very, very good illusion, but the Pattern Scanners  said that form was human, as did Ranma and Major Saotome. The Major had not  seen her child in years, and Jacob did not want to cross her on that issue.</p><p>For the  Colonel it was a moot point. Ranma had shown herself to posses human values and  ethics, and that was enough for him. It was Ranma's character that had gotten  her to fight these monsters, and it was her morals that had made her a mother.</p><p>Jacob also  had to remind himself that while he was providing support for them and hunting  with them, he was <i>not</i> controlling  them. Unlike Rebecca, Ranma was a thinking creature and Jacob was not her  handler.</p><p>The agent  thoughts shifted away from those things and returned to simply watching the  demons fly. He chuckled to himself as he watched the Drake's child swoop down  and tag Lt. Tendo's sister.</p><p>From his position,  the agent could just barely see the blue-haired demoness' eyes flare as she  corkscrewed around and tried to catch her mate. Their mother then swooped in a  bit closer and shouted some advice to the pursuing demon.</p><p>Shortly  after this the three demons landed. The younger demonesses were not quite as  graceful as their elder but they managed to touch the ground without tripping  or falling. The Operations Section colonel smiled as he watched the demons walk  over to a waiting Lt. Tendo.</p><p>The agent  sighed with relief. Despite the strangeness, things still looked like things  could go according to plan.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"Yes,  what do you want?" the mullet-wearing educator asked the person that stood  next to him. His tone was pleasant but strained.</p><p>The  girl the man had given the name Sunshine to looked at the grass and the trees  that lay beyond the porch rail they were leaning on before continuing. WIC  Toronto-B was much nicer than that underground warren that served as their A  base She knew that a pair of fences surrounded this facility; they were on the  other side of the trees and were out of sight. "It's about Nariko,"  she said after checking to make sure her daughter was out of sight. She and  Akane were being watched by Nodoka elsewhere on the base.</p><p>"Our  child?" Drake chuckled, darkly.</p><p>"Actually,  that's exactly it," the redhead sighed. "You took care of her. You  took care of her even when I thought she was an annoying monster. So far you've  been a better father to her than I've been a mother."</p><p>"A  lot of good that did. When she asked if she could change her name, I simply  called up Jacob and asked him if he could have the Company do it. Nariko's not  my son," the Drake admitted, while maintaining most of his composure.</p><p>Ranma  put her hand on his shoulder. "No she's your daughter, and you kept her  from doing anything... unacceptable. If you hadn't been there for her, she  would have lost <i>all</i> of her humanity,  and turned wild."</p><p>"What  are you getting at?" the Drake asked his voice gaining an edge.</p><p>"I'm  thanking you for keeping my daughter out of trouble. You saved her life,"  Ranma said before moving her hand back to the railing. The redhead knew full  well what the Company would do to Nariko if she had not behaved herself.</p><p>"I  see," the principal stated. "Your daughter? So you're accepting what  she is to you?"</p><p>"I  tried denying my relation to her and look what that did," Ranma sighed.</p><p>"She  needs you. She needs to be with you. She needs your love," Drake noted.</p><p>"Yes.  You seem to be taking this well."</p><p>"Only  out of concern for my child," the Drake said narrowing his eyes. "You  <i>abandoned</i> her. You ran from your  responsibilities, and doing so ruined a person. That she still needs you is the  only reason I'm going along with this. I just hope you won't betray her again."<br/>"I know, and I  won't," Ranma affirmed, her eyes glowing slightly. "You're still her  father; she still needs you."</p><p>"However?"  the Drake asked eyeing the demoness.</p><p>"I  think she should live with me. She'll spend time with you, likely even  overnight, but most of the time she'd be with me."</p><p>"Physically,  that would be best for her," the Drake admitted.</p><p>"You  talked to Dr. Tofu about what had happened last night?" Ranma asked. It  made sense. The Drake would be curious about his child's new mate.</p><p>"Yes,"  the Drake said looking over the redhead. "I also talked to him about Akane  and <i>her</i> chances for recovery,"  the man accused.</p><p>Ranma  looked down and sighed. She had discussed things with the pathologist as well.  "So you know she can recover, but that Nariko can't," the redhead  said. Nariko had been abandoned during those first formative days and her old  personality was essentially lost, but Akane had a chance.</p><p>"You  saved my son's life, but then you killed him," the educator said in a cold  voice that matched with the anger in his eyes. "If you hadn't been so  selfish he could have recovered. Granted he still would have been a demoness,  but it would have been <i>him</i> in that  girl. Instead, Tatewaki died alone and scared."</p><p>"I am  sorry. But come on! I saved someone's life, and suddenly I'm their mother! I  didn't see <i>that</i> one coming,"  Ranma defended.</p><p>"That's not good enough!"  Drake shouted his eyes staring down the demoness. "I hope you were simply  ignorant about one of your children needing you so much! Otherwise that would  make you a negligent, horrible mother."</p><p>Ranma's  expression hardened at the accusation. "At the time, I didn't know she was  my daughter! I'm new at this! I even tried to cure her. I brought her to  Jusenkyou, but that didn't work!" the redhead countered, part of her  wanting to silence him for his arrogance.</p><p>"I  lost my only son. I had to watch you change him. And I tried to love the girl  she had become, but it wasn't enough. She needed her mother. A mother who could  barely tolerate her!" Drake angrily lectured.</p><p>Ranma  looked off into the distance, and tried to control herself. The words hurt, and  she wanted to reciprocate. The redhead noticed that her claws were starting to  flicker in and out of existence.</p><p>"No,  you simply turned him and dropped a creature I was wholly incapable of raising  in my lap," the man continued.</p><p>Ranma  inhaled. She had to control herself. Her daughter would be unhappy if she  killed Nariko's father. Mom would also be disappointed in her. She paused to  regain control and check her emotions.</p><p>"First  off, you have no idea how close you were to becoming a burnt smear. I am the <i>wrong</i> person to lecture. Not today and  certainly not about <i>my</i> daughter!</p><p>"You  know why it took me so long to realize that Nariko was my kid?" Ranma  asked as her eyes glowing in anger. "First off, I'm a child myself who has  no idea about raising kids. I'm only sixteen, and a <i>guy. </i>And don't get me started about my parents. I hadn't seen my  mother in years, and my father's an incompetent oaf and a thief. So, I'm sorry  if I'm a bit shaky at this!</p><p>"As  for your son, I <i>hated</i> Tatewaki! He  was a total jerk who kept hitting on me. So again, I'm sorry that I thought the  girl who kept trying to be with me was just the female version of the guy who  had done the same. I didn't know that I was her mother. Hell, did you?Hedasfasdfad"Ranma  ranted.</p><p>"Misinterpretation?"  Drake asked. "Was it all that simple?" he inquired mostly to himself.  He was still angry at the demoness, but he was also aware of how precarious his  position really was.</p><p>"Yes a  very, very bad one. We both thought it was a romantic love between us,"  Ranma glared at the man.</p><p>Drake  nodded in thought. Ranma was remorseful, and was racked with guilt about what  had happened. She also wanted Nariko to succeed, grow and be happy very badly.  He could not ask for anything else that was obtainable, but he still felt angry  and cheated. "I guess it's not your fault. Besides if it wasn't for you he  <i>would</i> be dead," the man  admitted, reluctantly.</p><p>"Yes,"  Ranma nodded. "But with all of our help, we can do a lot to help Nariko.  And I can do with or without you," she added, sternly.</p><p>"Especially  now that's she's got both her Ray of Sunshine and her Noble Akane," Drake  chuckled despite himself.</p><p>"At  least she was able to get that much," Ranma offered as she gave a slight  smile.</p><p>"True,"  Principal Kuno admitted. His options were limited and he had to do what was  best for Nariko. "She can stay with you, but I'm still going to be in her  life."</p><p>"Thank  you. Nariko needs both her mother <i>and</i>  her father," Ranma replied. She then turned to see a Company agent  approach them.</p><p>"There  you are," Jacob said as he walked to the two parents. His hands were  clasped behind his back and his stance was loose. The WIC officer almost looked  relaxed.</p><p>"Yes?"  the Drake asked the other man.</p><p>"I'm  just here to tell Ranma that we have found the necessary tapes. When do you  want to brief her family?" Jacob asked the demoness.</p><p>"Today  if possible," Ranma said.</p><p>"You're  going to tell Akane's family?" the Drake asked.</p><p>"Yes,  Soun and Nabiki are going to know something's different with Akane. They should  know the truth. Akane will need her father too," Ranma nodded</p><p>"I can  make it this afternoon," Jacob offered.</p><p>"You  don't have to come," Ranma suggested. Despite being more approachable than  most of the WIC officers she had met, Colonel Edwards was still creepy.</p><p>"Yes,  I do. I was the one that convinced Soun to let Kasumi to join WIC. It's my  responsibility."</p><p>"Fair  enough," Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Good,"  Jacob said as he smiled slightly at the partially cloudy sky. "Your mother  and daughters are waiting for you in the break room," he informed,  pointing his finger to a nearby building.</p><p>The agent  waited until the demoness had walked out of earshot. "Try to be accepting  with her. She is trying her <i>hardest</i>  at this," Jacob advised the other man.</p><p>The Drake  eyed the agent. In the years they had worked together, the Drake finding likely  recruits and Jacob getting them to join WIC, the two men had gotten something  of a friendship. Jacob knew everything about Principal Drake Kuno, but he knew  nothing about Jacob's personal life. Most of the time, he doubted if the man  even had one.</p><p>There were  rumors. The most popular formula being that Jacob was a young SWAT policeman,  FBI agent, or Army Special Forces Officer that had lost his wife and young  child, pregnant fiancee, or parents to cultists, vampires, or demons and in  order to get retribution swore revenge and joined the Company. The Drake had  his doubts, and they were not just because Jacob never wore a wedding or  engagement ring.</p><p>The Drake  did know that Jacob was absolutely committed to the Company and was willing to  do anything for it. Despite this, Drake said what he was thinking. "I know  why you're siding with her. God forbid you loose your pet Pattern Silver. You  know she's going to need a lot of help to raise those kids, and the Company's  going to be right there to foot the bill. And <i>I</i> know you're just praying that her kids become Pattern Silvers  too, or at least have enough Silver in them to work for your ultimate plan.  That is why you're here isn't it?"</p><p>"You  are still on thin ice Drake," Jacob warned while suppressing a smile.  Whoever the Drake was getting his information from had an amusing sense of  humor. There was also the issue of Drake's blackmailer but that would be  resolved rather soon. It was just a mater of making sure the extortionist did  not have anything unpleasant that would be released if anything happened to  him. For good reasons, WIC has always been wary of journalists.</p><p>"The  worst you can do is kill me," Drake countered. "You won't harm either  of my daughters, not with one training to be an agent and the other being  protected by Sunshine," the principal laughed darkly.</p><p>"I'm  not threatening you." Jacob sighed. "I'm just giving you a  suggestion. We have to work together if we want to survive this."</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>Ranma  entered the room. She smiled when she saw her family sitting around the coffee table  in the Company break room. Her daughters were sitting next to each other on the  couch. They grinned and separated to make a place for their mother.</p><p>The redhead  sat in the offered spot and wrapped her arms around Nariko and Akane. "You  girls have fun with Grandma?" the redhead asked, having her girls lean on  her helped.</p><p>"Yes,  she's got lots of interesting stories," Akane smiled.</p><p>"I'm  sure she does," Ranma sighed as she held her girls tighter. Their presence  helped sooth her.</p><p>"What's  wrong, Mommy?" Nariko asked looking at her mother's face.</p><p>"Oh  nothing," Ranma assured.</p><p>"Is  the Drake still here?" Nodoka inquired.</p><p>"Yes,  he's talking with Jacob."</p><p>"Nariko,  why don't you show your father your new mate?" Nodoka suggested.</p><p>"Okay,"  the demoness said as she and Akane got up and nearly scampered out of the room.</p><p>Major  Saotome stood up and sat back down next to Ranma. "Thing's didn't go well  with Drake?"</p><p>"I'm  not a bad mother; I'm not," the redhead uttered as she leaned her head on  the older woman's chest. "I shouldn't even <i>be</i> a mother!"</p><p>"It's  okay. He's just grieving," Nodoka said as she wrapped her arms around her  daughter.</p><p>The girl  smiled at her mother's touch. "I won't fail them ever again," she  promised her tone hardening. Concern for her children's welfare gave her  demonic body a purpose and made the situation tolerable. "I don't have the  luxury of whining and fighting this. I can't be that selfish."</p><p>Nodoka  looked into the demon's eyes. Despite being a different shade and shape, they  were still very familiar; they were still her son's. "Is this what you  want?" Nodoka asked, now stroking her child's hair.</p><p>"I'd  be lying it I said that it didn't feel good and right," Ranma said smiling  slightly in remembrance of the previous night. "But that's not relevant. I  <i>have</i> to be their mother. They need  me. I accept that. Even if it means being... this."</p><p>Nodoka  nodded. "That's a very adult thing to do. I'm very proud of you. You've  shown immense character and strength," she said with genuine admiration in  her voice. Despite all the trials her child had gone though, <i>he</i> had won.</p><p>Ranma  smiled and closed her eyes. She now understood why her children loved to be in  her presence. Being held, being protected, by Mother was an amazing experience.  The demoness and the WIC officer stayed like that for a couple minutes.</p><p>The two were interrupted by the return of  Akane and Nariko. With a mischievous smile on her face, Ranma told her spawn  what to do, and Nodoka soon found herself being almost dog-piled by a trio of  young demonesses.</p><p>The agent  observed how the effect Nariko and Akane had on their mother's sprits, and she  became quite sure that her daughter would be able to handle this.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"Oh,  hello Jacob," Soun said to the man standing on the front porch. "What's  going on?" Beyond the suited Company man Soun could see a pair of silver  sedans and a large van parked in the driveway. His eldest daughter was talking  with her coworkers between the vehicles.</p><p>"It's  about your daughters," the agent said.</p><p>"What  about them? I got the message from Kasumi, but it wasn't too clear. All she  said was that Akane was hurt," Soun stated.</p><p>"I  think we should talk inside," Jacob said. He then motioned for some of the  waiting agents to follow him in.</p><p>"Okay,"  Soun replied with some confusion as he watched Kasumi and a couple other WIC  personnel enter the house.</p><p>"Can  you please call Nabiki and Genma here as well?" Jacob politely, asked.  From their surveillance they knew that both people were still in the house.</p><p>Soun nodded  and called his daughter and old friend into the living room.</p><p>Jacob used  this opportunity to make sure that the Communications and Cryptography agent  had connected her laptop to the TV in the room.</p><p>"What's  going on?" Nabiki asked as she entered the room. She looked to see her  father, Ranma's father, Kasumi, a man who appeared to be her boss, and a few  other cooperate drones in the room.</p><p>"Apparently,  something happened to Akane yesterday," Soun said.</p><p>"Yes,  but fortunately she got medical attention quickly and is stable. The problem is  that Akane's condition is... well, complicated. I think this short video will  best prepare you for it," Jacob explained.</p><p>Kasumi  wished she could roll her eyes, but her training and respect for the Colonel  prevented that. The civilian briefing tapes that WIC used were notoriously  dated. The only reason they were not updated was because they were used so  infrequently.</p><p>The  communications agent activated the recording stored on her computer. As the  television screen switched to a crew-cut tall man wearing a grey suit with a  thin black tie, Kasumi allowed a small smirk to appear on her face. <i>At least this one's in color,</i> Lt. Tendo  thought to herself. As the recording played, the three civilians watched with  some confusion as the Company agent from Public Relations Section began to  explain things.</p><p>The tape  itself was essentially a brief history of the Company, its goals, WIC's  activities, and some of the things that the organization had done. It was a  basic primer used to get people familiar to what Willard International  Consulting was.</p><p>Jacob  watched the reactions the uninitiated were giving off. They were all confused  but Soun seemed to be especially befuddled. It was as if he was incapable of or  was refusing to connect the dots. The other two were fairing better. Genma's  face looked bored, but his eyes were contemplative.</p><p>The agent  had believed that Genma knew something was off with his son. After all, Ranma's  cursed form had supposedly changed and he had spent some time locked in demoness  form. That Genma did not know anything specific about what Ranma had become was  found out during the martial artist's 'interview'.</p><p>The girl  seemed to be the fastest at putting things together. Nabiki's face was in a mix  of shock and contemplation. Nabiki waited until the short film had finished and  Kasumi had explained some of her past before she spoke.</p><p>"Am I  to believe that my older sister has spent the last five years working for a  secretive organization dedicated to fighting demons and other supernatural  invaders? If it wasn't for Ranma's curse I'd assume this was all an elaborate  hoax," Nabiki said in a tone that indicated she had yet to be fully  convinced.</p><p>"If  you find that hard to believe you should hear the rest of it," Kasumi  laughed.</p><p>"I'll  assume it has something to do with Akane and Ranma. They've both been missing  since yesterday."</p><p>"I  think it's time for them to be told the rest of it," Jacob observed. He  then turned to the communications agent that had set up the video. "Agent  Iverson, please get Miss Ranma and her girls."</p><p>"Dad,  Nabiki, when you see Akane, please remember that she's still Akane,"  Kasumi advised as Iverson returned with what appeared to be three girls.</p><p>"Why  because she got a dye job and started wearing trashy clothes?" Nabiki  asked when she saw Akane. "Is she sick? Her skin's pretty pale," she  noted after a second glance.</p><p>Kasumi looked at her fiance and her children  before responding. "You don't know the full extent of Ranma's curse. Ranma  does not simply turn into a girl," Kasumi said as she began to explain  what Ranma was and how Nariko and Akane had been turned. Her explanation only  omitted the Pattern Silvers and that Ranma was one of them.</p><p>"Okay  girls, show them," the redhead said.</p><p>As she  watched her little sister turn into a demon, the middle Tendo mumbled  something, likely containing the word God and maybe an expletive or two.</p><p>Soun's  befuddlement at the video had transposed into simple denial at Kasumi's story.  However, seeing Akane in her true form was too much for him and the man passed  out.</p><p>"Boy!  What's going on here?" Genma demanded after he had checked to make sure  that Soun was alright.</p><p>"I got  tricked and ended up with my girl-form turning demonic. I had to turn these two  girls," Ranma explained as she idly swished her tail.</p><p>"And  now you're their mother," Nabiki reasoned as she tried to figure out the  insanity before her.</p><p>"I'm  so embarrassed," Genma moaned. "My poor son. His mind's been twisted  by this new body, and he thinks he's a weak, silly girl. If only he were strong  enough to resist."</p><p>"Don't  you dare say that!" Ranma's eyes flared blue-ish  violet in anger. "I <i>had</i> to turn  them. I was asked to save them; I couldn't just let them die."</p><p>"So  you saved them. That's not so bad. But you still abandoned your masculinity. I  guess you're weak after all," Genma smugly replied.</p><p>"I'm <i>more</i> than strong enough to fight these  urges! I did that with my first kid for a while, and you know what? It <i>ruined</i> her! I won't do that again."  Ranma growled as her fangs lengthened slightly.</p><p>"Obviously,  you don't know how to be a competent parent."</p><p>"Just  shut up!" the redheaded demon exclaimed, her eyes flaring again. "I'm  not going to be lectured by <i>you</i> about  parenting. Stop this crap or I will hurt you. And don't think that these  Company goons would stop me. They <i>were</i>  going to let Mom kill you."</p><p>Jacob  remained silent neither conforming nor denying, but he did allow the right  corner of his mouth to form a slight smirk.</p><p>Genma gazed  into Ranma's eyes and his will faltered.</p><p>"So  Akane, you're a demon, now?" Nabiki asked</p><p>Akane  nodded happily as she nuzzled her mate.</p><p>"What  did you do to her? What happened to her?" Nabiki demanded the strangers  and people she thought she knew.</p><p>"It  was either this or death," Kasumi repeated. "She was already a demon.  I made the decision to save her."</p><p>Nabiki's  response was interrupted by her father. "I had the worst nightmare,"  Soun said as he regained consciousness. "My baby girl had turned into  a-" His eyes then widened with realization.</p><p>"Hi  Daddy!" Akane cheerfully greeted. "This is my mate Nariko and you  already know my Mommy."</p><p>"Mommy?"  Soun asked.</p><p>"Yeah  that's me," Ranma sighed. "Look, Akane <i>is</i> a demon now, but with everyone's help we can bring her back. It  will take time and effort but she will recover," the redhead suggested in  a pleading tone.</p><p>"So  you're saying this lesbian leather-fetish bimbo can be my sister again?"</p><p>"But  Nabiki, I am your sister," Akane whined.</p><p>"I  don't know. Akane would never willingly touch Kuno."</p><p>"But...  Nariko's pretty and nice," Akane said.</p><p>"Nabiki,  that's enough!" Ranma growled.</p><p>"Yes,  daughter. Don't pester your sister," Soun stated his focus still on his  winged child.</p><p>"You  can clearly see that there's a problem with Akane!"</p><p>"Just  because Akane's a bit... different doesn't mean that she's still not a part of  this family," Soun said.</p><p>"Wow,  that's remarkably lucid Dad. I'm impressed," Kasumi remarked.</p><p>"I  have to be, if Akane is to overcome her disability."</p><p>"I  see," Lt. Tendo replied. She should have expected him to do something like  this. Denial was his main coping mechanism. Father had yet to broach the  subject of her own job.</p><p>"Kasumi,  I'm surprised at you. If you're some kind of demon hunter how could you do this  to Akane?"</p><p>The  operations agent narrowed her eyes. "Are you asking me why I didn't kill  Akane? Why I didn't shoot her in the head?" Kasumi asked her voice  strangely casual. It had taken a lot of effort on her part to avoid doing just  that, but Nariko's presence gave Kasumi an alternative.</p><p>"I  didn't want to die," Akane cried. Her eyes locked onto the younger of her  two sisters. "I already was a demon. This way I'm still myself, not some  puppet," the blue-haired girl said as one of her wings was scratched by  her mate.</p><p>"And  what kind of demons are you anyway?" Nabiki inquired, trying to shift the  subject.</p><p>"Succubae,"  Ranma sighed.</p><p>Nabiki  looked at the brood of demons. They were extremely good looking. It went beyond  their physical appearance, which was only slightly marred by their extra, non  human appendages. "Hmm, you <i>are</i>  cute demon girls. Yeah I can see that, Saotome."</p><p>"Awww, you think I'm cute," Ranma smiled. "Think  you could handle me though?" the redhead teased as she licked one of her  fangs.</p><p>"No  thanks," Nabiki sighed. "I don't swing that way. And I thought that  your kind was into guys."</p><p>"You  have seen your sister and her mate?" Ranma asked dryly. "No, human  males are nothing more than a food source."</p><p>Nabiki  raised her eyebrow.</p><p>"No,  not like that!" Ranma said in disgust. "Actually... it is just like  that," the demoness corrected herself. "Thankfully there's other ways  we can feed, and we don't need too much energy."</p><p>"So  what do you do instead of seducing guys?"</p><p>"Actually  it's guys and girls. It's just that with our forms it's easier to go after  guys. But from a nutritional standpoint it's the same," Ranma explained,  recalling some of what had been taught to her about this body.</p><p>"My  youngest daughter's now a soul draining monster!" Soun wailed.</p><p>"Well,  that got him to respond," Kasumi remarked.</p><p>"So  what do you do for food?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"We  eat meat, and sometimes we kill things and drain them as they die," Ranma  said, simply.</p><p>"Oh  God."</p><p>"You're  no vegetarian; you eat the flesh of animals. We just take something else from  them," Ranma explained.</p><p>"You  sure you're a succubus? I thought they had to drain humans," Nabiki asked.  Her sister and Nariko seemed amorous enough</p><p>"Well  Nabiki, you haven't had much experience with demons and other non-humans.  Surprisingly they don't exactly match the description that's in your Monstrous  Manual."</p><p>Nabiki  blinked. She should have known that that Kasumi would remember that. Nabiki had  only played it casually and she had quit Dungeons and Dragons years ago,</p><p>"Heh, you played that game? Man, what a dork," Ranma  laughed.</p><p>"Keep  it up and I'm sure some comic book geeks will 'just happen' to get some photos  of you and your kids."</p><p>"Brilliant  plan sis, threaten the hormonal, gender-confused, demon mother's children. And  besides if you do expose this secret it will be a race between her and me to  see who can silence you first."</p><p>"You  wouldn't," Nabiki responded before she had time to consider her statement.  She then looked at Kasumi, who had a slight smile on her face. Of course Kasumi  would be willing to do it; Akane was living proof of that. Nabiki might not be  killed but her life could be made very unpleasant. The middle daughter was just  now starting to grasp how out of her depth she was.</p><p>"Hey!  I'm not gender confused. I'm a guy! I just have kids," Ranma said before  adding in a much sterner voice. "Yes, Nabiki don't even think about  threatening my girls. I'll take out anyone, anyone who's a threat to them.  Isn't that right Pops?"</p><p>Genma froze  when he looked at his, currently demonic and female, son. He had always been  afraid of those purple and blue eyes, but now they were much worse.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>As Ranma  walked down a series of dull grey corridors, the martial artist's mind was pondering...  Memories was the word that fit best. Pluto's procedure had done more than just  turn Ranma's cursed form into a demonic Sailor Senshi. There was something  else. There were things that the occasional demon was starting to starting to  recall. The species of demon Ranma's girl-form was among them. Murdock had  explained some demonic biology to Ranma, but there were some things that only  certain people knew that the martial artist was now aware of.</p><p>Ranma's  thoughts stopped. The destination was in sight. The distance to the door was  closed and it was opened. Ranma stepped through. The drab room was quite  familiar to the teen.</p><p>Ranma  turned to see a demoness nearly identical to herself. If Ranma were to activate  her Sailor DarkStar form then two demons would be identical. The new demoness  walked over to the others and sat down on the armrest of one of the chairs in  the room.</p><p>"Howdy  partner," the other demoness greeted.</p><p>"Who  are you?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"DarkStar.  The first one."</p><p>"Oh,  well... this is just great. My dream self image is that of a succubus,"  Ranma said, wishing that she had shown up as a guy.</p><p>"That's  because you're sleeping in between your children," DarkStar said with a  smile. She never got to have kids during her life and was happy that some part  of her managed to get them.</p><p>"Oh,  makes sense," Ranma said. She would have preferred to sleep as a human  male, but her kid's needs were more important.</p><p>"For  what it's worth I am sorry." DarkStar apologized to the other redhead.  "Turning into a demon is never easy. Well... it can be but then you're  just a slave of the person that turned you. On the plus side. This is a dream.  So just change your form," DarkStar added.</p><p>Ranma  shrugged and shifted into her birth form. "Nice," he said while  looking at his hands. "This didn't actually turn my body male did  it?" the pigtailed martial artist asked. "I don't want to freak out  my kids."</p><p>DarkStar  smiled again. "No your form didn't really change. Your girls are still  sleeping soundly against their mother."</p><p>Ranma  nodded. The girls would definitely have woken up if their connection to her had  been severed.</p><p>"I  don't want to be brainwashed. But what about using Usagi's powerful crystal to  turn us human?" Ranma asked. If her kids could be returned to human form that  might work.</p><p>"Sorry  Ranma. I knew the Queen Serenity of that day, when I was alive. She tried that  exact same thing on me."</p><p>"It  didn't work?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Nope.  I wasn't evil so there was no darkness to exorcise out. Sure it <i>purified</i> me, but I was still a demon. It  did relieve Serenity greatly that I had passed that test though. She wouldn't  let just anyone work with her, especially a demon.</p><p>"The  Ginzuishou <i>could</i> turn a demon into a  human through brute force. Problem is that that much energy rewriting and  altering would essentially destroy the demon's mind. That's why I was never  changed."</p><p>"I'm  not doing that to my kids. I'd hate to say it, but you're right. I don't see a  way to cure myself and my kids... without ruining our minds. Jusenkyou certainly  didn't work. I've had enough of that. Something might come along, but right now  I have to raise them. That's more important."</p><p>"Good  for you," DarkStar agreed.</p><p>"I'm  surprised you're not some sex-crazed bimbo," Ranma noted.</p><p>"Hey!  I'm not that bad. Though, it would be nice to have a mate, for once,"  DarkStar sighed. Her life had been fairly lonely. She only had dim memories of  her brood mother. Her guardian Walter, the Terran royal that had taken care of  her and raised her was the only person that had ever really cared for her, but  he had died. Eventually, the Sailor Senshi learned to trust her, but DarkStar  had still died without ever having sex. Given her species of demon that was  quite, quite unusual.</p><p>"So  what's this all about?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Nothing  much. You've just started to unlock our old memories," DarkStar grinned,  showing a fang.</p><p>"Our?  What do you mean? You're just the demon I was modeled after."</p><p>DarkStar  snickered.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>Ranma looked  at her reflection in the changing room. Her eyes looked to contain the same  amount of violet as they did four days ago. She smiled, glad that training her  children in how to fly and fight and spending nearly all of her time in demonic  form had not accelerated the change.</p><p>"How's  the dress, Mommy?" Nariko asked from the other side of the door that  separated the changing cubicle.</p><p>"I'm  still taking off my clothing, and be more careful with that name, dear,"  the redhead warned as she took off her modified Furinkan uniform. She could  have made it vanish, but someone might wonder where it went if they noticed it  missing.</p><p>"I'm  sorry... um... Sunny," Nariko said as she thought of something else to  call her Mother. It sounded like Mommy and was close to the alias her Mother  used for school.</p><p>"I  guess that works." Ranma said begrudgingly. She did not care for the name  that the Drake had invented for her and Sunny was even worse. However, Ranma  did not want to correct her daughter; Nariko was trying her best, and she <i>did</i> come up with a name that was not  Mommy.</p><p>The redhead  would have preferred to be called Ranma, but she knew from experience that  neither of her children was comfortable with calling her by that name. Down to  her underwear she looked at the garments that her children had picked out for  her. She sighed as she put on Akane's selection. At least it was not a skirt,  but that was small consolation.</p><p>As she  slipped on the shorts and the top, the redhead concentrated. When she had first  been turned into a demon Ranma had only been able to wear that one leather  dress. Everything else she tried to wear would simply turn into it. Later she  managed to put on a school uniform that only modified itself. It seemed that  now she was able to put on clothing and not worry about it changing. Though she  had only tried certain leather and Lycra items.</p><p>The redhead  smiled. This was at least one problem solved. She was no longer forced into  wearing that leather dress or her school uniform. After stepping back into her  boots and adjusting the tiny black shorts and scoop necked tank-top, Ranma  stepped out of the dressing room.</p><p>"It  looks really good on you," Akane said with a smile. As much fun as it was  to pick out clothing for herself and her mate, it was another matter for find  stuff for their mother. The blue-haired succubus found her mother's modesty  endearing.</p><p>"It  shows off your legs really well," Nariko complimented.</p><p>"That's  because there's nothing covering her legs," Kasumi stated. She was neutral  on most of the store's clothing selection. Although there was a leather jacket  that she found interesting.</p><p>"It's  quite revealing," Nodoka said. She should have known that this store would  be where her grandchildren would want to shop. At least now they were looking  at the clothing section. The scientist was not sure how to handle it if they  went to the video or <i>toy</i> sections.</p><p>"But  Mo- Sunny should show off her body," Akane said, remembering to use the  name Nariko had come up with.</p><p>"It's  nice but a bit much for being in public," Ranma added. "Even you're  wearing more."</p><p>Akane  nodded. At Mommy's insistence, her shorts now went to mid thigh.</p><p>"Though  it is a pretty nice outfit. I like how the top buckles in the front,"  Ranma said trying to please her daughter. Honestly, she did not find the shorts  too bad.</p><p>"Thanks  Sunny!" Akane gushed.</p><p>"Here  try on this one." Nariko offered as she handed a folded garment to Ranma.  "Grandma and I picked it out."</p><p>Ranma gave  a questioning glance to her mother.</p><p>"It's  strange for me too, but Nari-chan was insistent," Nodoka explained. It had  been trying to find something tasteful in the store. She was curious to see how  her daughter (definitely daughter in this case) looked in the dress.</p><p>Ranma took the leather garment and  shrugged. She then turned and went back into the dressing room. The redhead  slipped out of Akane's offering and donned the article of clothing. After  making sure that it was on straight the demoness exited the dressing cubicle.</p><p>Dark red,  the succubus' leather dress ended within a couple inches of her knees. It was  zippered in the front, and the interlocking teeth ran from the waist to the  neck. The dress was designed to be worn either fully zipped up or partially  zipped.</p><p>The redhead  found it a bit constricting around her neck when it was zipped up all the way.  Therefore zipper's pull tab currently rested just above the redhead's breasts.  This formed a sharp V of visible flesh that went from Ranma's neck to her  chest.</p><p>The dress  had a dark violet, almost black, collar that was wide in the front and thinned  in the back. Full-length sleeves with simple cuffs came out of its shoulders.  Unlike the previous garment the dress did not cling like a second skin. Granted  it still hugged the girl's curves but it was much less brazen than her other  leather dress.</p><p>"See,  Grandma and I could make a compromise," Nariko grinned.</p><p>"Sunny  does look good," Akane agreed.</p><p>Nodoka  smiled. It was good to see her child was wearing something a bit more modest,  but more importantly, more mature. "What do you think of it, dear?"</p><p>Ranma  looked at the dress she was wearing. "It is better than my old dress. It's  much more comfortable. It's simple, not too flashy or girly," the succubus  appraised.</p><p>Kasumi raised  an eyebrow, but remained silent. She supposed that such a dress could be  described as not girly. A piece of clothing <i>could</i>  be feminine without being girly.</p><p>The redhead  tapped one of her boots on the floor as studied her reflection in a full-length  three segmented mirror. "Even the color's right. Yeah, I actually like it.  Thanks Mom, Nariko," Ranma said before hugging her daughter and Mother.</p><p>"What  about my choice?" Akane asked in a concerned voice.</p><p>"It  was nice, but it's not quite for every day use. Maybe for training and around  the house," Ranma reassured.</p><p>"Come  on Akane, let's find something <i>Sunny</i>  will like," Kasumi offered as she took Akane's hand. The blue-haired girl  nodded. Lt. Tendo then flashed a small smirk at her fiance.</p><p><i>How bad could it be? </i>Ranma thought with  a shrug. She had already tried out something that was one step from being  naked. The demoness shook her head. The things she did for her kids.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"Thanks  for paying Mom, but I could have handled it," Ranma as the trio of demons  and pair of agents entered the restaurant. Her bank account could have just  paid for the two outfits each that she and her two girls had purchased.</p><p>"I  could have paid too," Nariko pouted as she followed her mother in her new  leather tube dress. Shoulderless, it went from the top of her breasts to  mid-thigh. It was a vivid purple with slits on either side of the skirt hem.</p><p>"I  wanted to reward you girls for what you've done these last few days,"  Nodoka explained.</p><p>"Nariko,  you and Akane should go with Kasumi and make sure the hostess gets a good  corner booth for us," Ranma suggested before giving a questioning glance  at her mother.</p><p>"Akane  seems to be doing better with people," Nodoka observed as she watched the  pale, blue-haired girl chat with the hostess.</p><p>"They  have done well in their training," Ranma said with genuine pride. It was  such a pleasure to see her children not only develop their powers and skills,  but also to see them interact normally interacting with people.</p><p>"I  want to help you with this. I may have missed out on your childhood, but I'll  be with you for Akane's and Nariko's," Nodoka reassured. If only she had  been able to stop Ranma from leaving... her son might have been human; Ranma  might have been safe. Nodoka cut off that line of reasoning. It was pointless  to try and think of what could have been. Her child needed her now.</p><p>"Thanks,  I didn't know how expensive this could get. Even with Mr. Tendo's and the  Drake's help. I still think I should get a job."</p><p>"Don't,  you've already got two. I've been saving my money while I've been working for  the Company. It'll be enough."</p><p>"Right,  two," Ranma mussed. The martial artist did have her responsibilities as  both a mother and a Sailor Senshi to worry about. At least school was not a major  concern. Officially Ranma was out sick, but she was really on maternity leave,  until she had gotten things straightened out with Akane and Nariko, who were  also "out sick."</p><p>"Akane  also seems to be improving in her taste in clothing," Nodoka remarked as  she walked with Ranma to the table where the others were seated.</p><p>"That's  just because I've been suggesting that she wear something that's street  legal."</p><p>"Unlike  the other outfit you bought," Nodoka remarked.</p><p>"Yeah,  I can't believe she found something more revealing than a bikini," the  redhead agreed, referring to a Lyra garment that was both see through and  miniscule. "But I did get that dress that you and Nariko picked out,"  Ranma sighed, indicating her own dress.</p><p>"At  least it was shorts, and not another skirt, that Akane picked out for  you," Nodoka noted with a little smile.</p><p>"Thanks  for remembering what I really am."</p><p>"I  know it's just that you have to do this for your kids. Come on they're  waiting," Nodoka said before the mother and daughter went to their table.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"What  do you mean it's impossible, Janet?" Usagi asked with some confusion on  her face. She then took another bite of her Sundae.</p><p>"Look,  you can't make a dress like that. You can't have a full length dress be tight down  the entire length of the legs. It would be impossible to walk in, or sit for  that matter." The newest member of the Sailor Senshi counted before  spooning the last of her ice-cream into her mouth.</p><p>"That  doesn't mean it's impossible to make or even wear," Ami countered.</p><p>"Yeah  and it flares out around the ankles," Usagi added.</p><p>"Oh  yeah, forgot about that," Janet dryly remarked. "Well, I'm getting  another scoop of strawberry. Either of you want anything?" the  auburn-haired girl asked. After getting negative responses from the blonde and  blue-haired teens she shrugged and walked up to the counter.</p><p>"I'm  glad I let her in. I think she'll work out fine," Usagi said. With Janet,  she got that sense of familiarity that she normally only had with other Senshi,  or Naru. The blonde kicked herself for not looking up her old friend. Already  reduced with her becoming Sailor Moon, contact between them had all but  disappeared when Naru's mother moved her shop to Kobe.</p><p>"Yeah,  I really like her too," Ami said her gaze shifting over to Janet before  returning to Usagi.</p><p>"It  must be nice to have a friend you can talk about smart stuff with," Usagi  offered.</p><p>Ami laughed  nervously.</p><p>"Don't  be bashful, I know you sometimes get lonely with us small brains," the  blonde joked.</p><p>"She  did handle herself well at that convenience store," Ami admitted.</p><p>"It is  a bit odd that she's an American. Even Ranma's from Japan."</p><p>Aim shook  her head "Ethnically, I'm pretty sure Janet's Japanese. Her family  probably just moved to the states a couple generations back. They either  changed their name when they immigrated or she has a paternal ancestor named  Fraiser."</p><p>"Okay,  makes sense," Usagi agreed. She then looked over to see Janet walking back  to their table.</p><p>"Well,  a gown like that would look very good on you," Janet admitted, carrying a  fresh bowl. "Though you'd only be good as a statue," Janet smiled,  her greenish grey eyes twinkling.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>On an  approach from the North-west, a Company helicopter was within five minutes of  its destination of WIC Toronto-B. Like nearly all Company vehicles the black  flying-machine carried an Ostar series Pattern scanner. Bulky and heavy, the  Ostar series had a much larger range and finer ability to resolve Pattern  Registering Entities than the man-portable NordStar series.</p><p>The Pattern  scanner was being manned by Specialist Agent Richard Morrison. This meant that  the agent kept an eye on the display and waited for anything significant to  show up. Morrison wondered if he would be able to detect the D-Silver brood.  Like he last time he had flown in to Toronto-B.</p><p>It was  somewhat unnerving to see two moderate and one very strong Pattern D show up  over a Company base. Although, the nineteen year old operations agent found <i>seeing</i> the demons in flight was also  unsettling.</p><p>The agent  then noticed that a blip of the static on the edge of the scanner's range was  unusually cyclic in how it fluxed on and off the screen. Curious, the agent  increased the power on the system. He was rewarded with a slightly steadier  signal.</p><p>"Lieutenant  Patterson, sir? I've may have something on the scanner. It hasn't resolved into  a coherent pattern yet, but I'd guess it's either D, E, or V," Richard  said as he continued to adjust the scanner.</p><p>"How  big? How many" Agent Morrison's commanding officer asked.</p><p>"I  can't tell at this range, but it's either a dozen low to mid class or a couple  higher ups," Richard evaluated as he analyzed the displayed pattern  further. "Hmmm, I'm leaning more towards D for the pattern," he said,  feeling it was more likely demonic in origin, as opposed to elemental or  vampiric.</p><p>"Where  is it Rich?" Lt. Patterson asked as he leaned over to see the display.</p><p>"West  of here in Vaughan, near highway 400," Richard read from the map that was  overlaid onto the scanner's readings.</p><p>"Simmons,  call base and tell them, we're taking a detour. We might have found  something," the lieutenant instructed the helicopter's pilot.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>Kasumi's  dinner was interrupted by the ringing of her cell phone. She answered it and  exchanged a few sentences.</p><p>"Who  is it?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"The  Colonel, Ma'am. They've found a nest of demons. They're getting ready to go in.  They've analyzed the sensors and they are the same sub-Pattern as Akane  was."</p><p>"Get  the check. Now," Ranma ordered her ears perking up.</p><p>"Sir,  we're on our way. ETA ten minutes." Kasumi said into the phone before  hanging up</p><p>"It's  her isn't it, Auntie?" Akane asked.</p><p>"It  might be," Kasumi confirmed as she got their waitress' attention and asked  for the bill.</p><p>"Good,"  Ranma said as she looked at her children.</p><p>The bill  arrived, Kasumi paid for it, and the quintet of women left the restaurant.  "The Pattern D's are in a group of buildings in a suburb to the North of  here. Command just found out about it; we're still getting people in  position," Kasumi explained as they walked to her car.</p><p>The drive  to the staging area was mostly silent. Ranma, sitting in the back flanked by  her kids, furrowed her brow in thought.</p><p>"What's  wrong, dear?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"I've  got a question for you two," Ranma proposed, her eyes darting to Nariko.  It was something she had to know. "Let's say you're wounded in battle,  unconscious, and –well- dying. Would you want me to... to...?" Ranma's  question trailed off.</p><p>"What?"  Kasumi asked. She had a fair idea what Ranma was trying to ask. It was then  confirmed when Ranma pointed to the black and violet-haired demon.</p><p>"Oh."  Nodoka blinked. That was an interesting question. Death or life as a demon.</p><p>"It's  okay if you don't want to do it. I understand. I want to know, just in  case," Ranma explained.</p><p>"Sorry,  I appreciate the offer, but no thanks," Lt. Tendo stated, her eyes  lingering on the reflection of her sister in the rearview mirror.</p><p>"How  come it's death for you but demon for Akane?" the redhead asked.</p><p>"It  was never Akane's choice. And it was between dying as a demon and living as  one," Kasumi answered.</p><p>"I  don't know, Ranma. It's a big change," Nodoka said. "I'm not sure I  could handle it," she admitted after a short pause.</p><p>"It's  okay. I had to ask," Ranma explained in a distant voice. That confirmed  it. If her mother or her fiancee was wounded beyond medical treatment she had  to watch them die.</p><p>"Mommy?  You okay" Nariko asked as she leaned on the taller succubus.</p><p>"Not  really," Ranma admitted as she gazed at the tips of her fingers.  "There's going to be fighting. And we're probably going to have to kill  some demons. It'll be unpleasant but it's something we have to do." Though  the succubus was really afraid of it being pleasant, both for her and her kids,  and what that would mean.</p><p>"It's  okay Mommy; they're evil. They're monsters," Nariko reassured.</p><p>"I  know. I'm still concerned. It's one thing for me to go in and kill them. I've crossed  that bridge already, but you girls haven't."</p><p>"There  are worse fates than death and there are worse things than killing. Evil  triumphs when good men do nothing," Kasumi quoted.</p><p>"I  know that!" Ranma said indignantly. "I'd have no problem ripping apart  anyone who came after any of you!" the demoness declared with more force  than she intended.</p><p>Kasumi  blinked at her inclusion yet did not comment on it.</p><p>The redhead  continued. "That's not an issue! Same with you two," Ranma turned to  her daughters. "I have been training you on how to use your bodies to  defend yourselves. If someone came after you... that's it. Some things you have  to do, no matter how bad they are, because the alternatives are worse.</p><p>"My  problem is that I feel like today's another day of training. Only now I've set  up live targets for you to go after. I don't like that I'm sending you off to  kill. If it was us defending ourselves that's one thing, but us going in and  taking them by surprise."</p><p>The redhead  noticed that that Kasumi was about to speak and cut her off. "Yes I know  that it makes sense to take them by surprise. They'd do the same... well, worse  to us. This way we can be the ones prepared and ready. That way we might not  get hurt. I understand why; I wouldn't be here and I certainly wouldn't have  brought my kids if I didn't."</p><p>"But?"  Kasumi asked.</p><p>"I  don't want to be a killer, and I certainly don't want them to be," Ranma  said, feeling the connection to her children. Physical contact helped with  that. "But I can't just stand aside and do nothing." Ranma closed her  eyes, knowing that some of her did want her kids to be just that. She wanted  them to be their best, and sometimes she found herself imagining what her  children would be like as hunters.</p><p>"I  understand," Nodoka said.</p><p>"I'm  not sure if you're ready girls," Ranma said as she put a hand on each of  her daughter's legs. "And if I think it's too hot in there, I won't let  you fight. Are you two sure you want to go with me?" Ranma asked, part of  her hoping that they would decline, another wanting to see her children  perform.</p><p>"Yes.  Alexia needs to be punished for what she did to me and you," Akane  confirmed her own eyes flaring slightly.</p><p>"It's  the right thing to do. And I can't abandon my mate and Mommy," Nariko  said, hesitantly. She was afraid, but she was also eager.</p><p>"We're  almost there," Kasumi announced. The Company sedan was only a couple of  miles from the staging area.</p><p>Ranma  nodded. She looked out the window to see the post dusk twilight. At least she  did not worry about that approaching darkness.</p><p>Kasumi  parked her car in a supermarket parking lot. Nearby was a group of WIC Humvees  and a pair of trucks. One of which was the modified tractor-trailer that served  mobile command center. Kasumi went to the trunk of her car and pulled out her  combat gear and armor. The two agents and three demons cleared the  plain-clothes agents guarding the vehicle and entered.</p><p>The tall,  somewhat thin, agent in charge looked up from a holographic display of a group  of small industrial buildings to see an older woman approach. "Major  Saotome," Adam Jarvis saluted once he recognized her.</p><p>"At  ease, Captain," Nodoka said as she returned the salute. "What's the  situation?"</p><p>"As  you can see, we've detected Pattern D's here, here, and here," the Captain  indicated on the translucent display. "Their power levels are somewhat  low. Most of them are around Class 3. It was rather fortunate that Agent  Morrison was even able to detect them at this range. Our current location is  just a couple miles from theirs. When we're ready we'll go in. I intend to take  Patterson's team and Tendo's team in at these points," Jarvis said before  going into further detail of his plan.</p><p>"Good,  I trust your ability to execute this plan." While Major Saotome was the  ranking agent present. It was still Jarvis' operation. Nodoka would let him run  the operation, provided that she agreed with his decisions. Situations like  this were one reason why all WIC agents regardless of Section receive combat  training and go on field rotations.</p><p>"And I  won't have to remind you that we have three Pattern D's working with us,"  Nodoka added.</p><p>"I've  already notified the strike teams Ma'am. They' won't rely on their pattern  scanners."</p><p>"They'd  better. I won't stand for one of us hurting my son or my grandkids.  Understood?" Nodoka inquired.</p><p>"Yes,  Ma'am," Jarvis agreed, wisely not making a statement about the gender of  the Major's son or about the descendants of a Company officer being demonic.</p><p>Ranma  looked at the display and shook her head. It looked like she could bring her  kids in on the fight. She still felt reluctance at it, but they had to start  sometime. "Mom, I'd like you to change the battle plans a bit," she  requested. Her own fears for what the fight would do to her humanity, her kid's  humanity, had to be pushed aside.</p><p>"Of  course, dear. Captain, we're modifying things a bit," Major Saotome said</p><p>"Yes,  Ma'am," Jarvis replied. He kept his face neutral. At least the other NH's  working for the Company were actually part of WIC. The redhead and her spawn  were not. The captain worried that their were insufficient safeguards around  this brood, but it was not his place to complain.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar flew through above the town of Vaughan. She spotted the building  visually slightly after she sensed the energy being given off by its occupants.  On her left and right sides, Akane and Nariko followed her. Changing her  approach, the redheaded demon angled her wings and twisted into a steep  controlled fall. Akane and Nariko replicated this maneuver with relative ease.</p><p>Ranma  gently landed on the roof of the smallish beige building, which was originally  designed as a machine shop and office. The other two demons landed shortly,  only making a bit more noise than their mother.</p><p>The redhead  looked over the two girls. Both had changed their clothing to more practical  leather boots, simple shorts that were a bit longer than Akane would prefer,  and backless tops. The demonic Sailor Senshi smiled despite herself. Akane and  Nariko looked as ready as they were going to be.</p><p>The sound  of approaching truck engines was then followed by gunfire. She was relieved  that the WIC agents were on time. Ripping off a roof-access hatch, DarkStar  jumped into the room she sensed to be clear.</p><p>The three  demons quickly exited the cramped storage room and entered a short hallway.  Ranma's eyes widened and she generated a violet orb wreathed in white flames in  her left hand.</p><p>A door  across the hall, to the left and marked "Women" opened. A demoness  with white hair launched herself through the threshold. The snarling demon's  eyes were glowing and her claws were extended.</p><p>Ranma  released the orb. The adhesive fluid within it doused the enemy succubus' neck  and left shoulder before igniting. Ignoring her burning flesh, the servant of  Alexia continued to close in.</p><p>Until Ranma  blocked her arms with one hand and grabbed her by the neck and squeezed with  the other. Ranma did not extend her partially-opaque crimson claws. There was  no need for blood. She simply crushed the demon's neck. As she died, the  redheaded demon looked into the still angry eyes and smiled slightly. True  demonic energy was much better tasting than that pathetic youma knock-off.</p><p>"Mommy!"  Nariko screamed as she released a dark purple orb similar to her mother's at a  demon that had just come around a corner in the hallway. The approaching  succubus dodged the magical napalm, summoned an orb of her own and was about to  toss it.</p><p>Both Ranma  and Akane turned and fired at the new target. The redhead's orb hit her in the  chest and Akane's blue one engulfed her head. The demon went down as everything  above her chest burned. Nariko looked down at the writhing demon and shuddered  in revulsion.</p><p>A series of  filaments then extended out her black tail's violet fins. With a whimper Nariko  plunged the end of her tail into the dying demon's chest. The poor thing at  least deserved a quick death. Nariko shuddered again. This time not in  revulsion. The energy was nowhere near as good as what she got from Mommy, but  it was still quite nice.</p><p>Ranma  looked on with her eyes tearing slightly, both out of pride and sadness. Her  daughter had made her first kill. Her thoughts on this were interrupted by  Akane.</p><p>"Mommy!  I think I hear something coming," Akane said quietly, now facing the opposite  end of the hallway from where Nariko's kill had come from.</p><p>Ranma  nodded. That was where the larger rooms of the building were and that was where  she had sensed more demons. "Nariko watch our backs," the redhead  ordered as the trio went forward.</p><p>The brood  of succubae exited the hallway and found themselves in an unusually  well-decorated room. The tile flooring had given way to thick carpeting, and  the furniture was large and comfortable. More importantly were the half-dozen  demonic residents of the room. They seemed to have been waiting for Ranma's  brood.</p><p>"Where's  Alexia?" Ranma demanded her eyes flaring an angry violet.</p><p>"You  will not get the Mistress," the lead demon, a tall woman with strawberry  blonde hair, replied. She then turned to Akane. "Hello Eclipse. Don't  worry we'll soon have you back," Laura smiled, showing her fangs. It was a  shame she had lost two of her mistress' minions but the intruders were now  outnumbered.</p><p>"Die!"  Akane growled, as she launched a pair of blue orbs wreathed in white flames at  the blonde. She then lunged at Laura, claws and tail filaments extended.</p><p>"Nariko  right!" Sailor DarkStar shouted as she fired on the demons on the left  side and leapt in between the leftmost pair...</p><p>Meanwhile,  Akane had Laura's charred, but still lively, form pinned on the ground. The  blonde tried to rake her talons over the other the traitorous spawn, but found  her hands caught. The blue-haired succubus attempted to use her tail but found  that her prey had wrapped her own around it.</p><p>Growling in  frustration, Ranma's daughter forced herself closer to the prone demon. When  she was in range she opened her jaws and closed her mouth over Laura's neck.  Like a child eating an apple, she tried to bite off as much as she could. Her  sharp teeth easily cut through the demon's flesh. As her face was sprayed with  arterial blood, Akane instinctively chewed and swallowed what was in her mouth.</p><p>Ranma  looked up from disemboweling a demon to see her younger daughter licking her  blood-soaked lips. The redhead simultaneously cringed and rejoiced at Akane's  accomplishment. The brood mother was happy that when instead of taking another  bite, Akane got up and dispatched another demon, this one only grazed by one of  Nariko's fireballs.</p><p>Nariko  stood over a pile of burnt and dismembered parts. They clearly belonged to a  pair of succubae. However, telling which torso went with which head or arm  would be a bit more difficult. The smell of freshly cut meat and hot blood was  very appetizing to her.</p><p>Her dinner <i>had</i> been interrupted; she was still  hungry. The blackish-violet-tressed girl found herself kneeling down and  reaching towards the pile. Their energy was nourishing and delicious. She  wondered what their meat would be like.</p><p>"Come  on!" Nariko's mother shouted. "There could still be others out  there."</p><p>"Are  you sure Mommy?" Akane asked as she used her hand to wipe some of the  blood of her face. "I don't feel any," she stated, idly licking her  bloodied palm.</p><p>"Neither  do I. But we're still going to search the place. Alexia could still be here and  <i>she</i> might be able to conceal  herself," Ranma said. She was extremely glad that she still wanted to get  her kids out of the room, away from the bodies. Though she could see the  benefit to letting them stay and allowing them to feed.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>In a  neighboring building, Lt. Tendo increased the pressure on her weapon's trigger.  The weapon released a burst of 7.62mm WIC-custom armor piercing rounds. The  agent smiled slightly as the demon's head disappeared in a cloud of blood,  bone, and hair.</p><p>Before the  demon's corpse had a chance to fall Agent First Class  Kowalski had lobbed a grenade around the corner she had come from. After  the explosion, Kasumi pointed to Specialist Agents Gabriel Smith and Sophie  Addison, and made the hand motion for them to go round the corner low and fast.</p><p>The two  agents nodded and went forward. They found the splattered remains of one demon  and the mangled form of another. She was a small succubus with light green  hair. The demon growled and tried to lift herself up, but the shrapnel wounds  in her body were severe.</p><p>"Don't,"  Kasumi ordered. This opportunity might be useful "Unless she can get at  you." She then talked into her headset. "Captain, we may have a  prisoner. Understood sir." The lieutenant then turned to her team.  "Aram, you're with me. We'll secure the rest of this corridor. Gabriel,  Sophie watch the demon. Patterson's team and the Captain will be here  shortly."</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>Murdock  looked at the woman sitting across from him with very well-concealed contempt.  While the mage found her to be an insufferable harpy, there was no reason that  she should be made aware of his feelings. After all, she might still prove  useful to him.</p><p>The rather  tall woman across from Murdock gave a very cold smile as she brushed back some  of her curly blonde hair. "I can't believe you're still worried about that  redheaded traitor."</p><p>"She  did easily subvert your first attempt," Murdock smirked, slightly. He  found the impudence was worth seeing her tanned face contort into rage.  Tweaking the vain always amused the rumpled suit-wearing man, and the woman  sitting across from him was vain even compared to her kind. That she even  bothered to keep her skin tanned spoke volumes.</p><p>"The  impudence!" Alexia's eyes would have flared but she was in a restaurant  and did not want to attract attention. "To steal my own creation. She <i>will</i> pay for that! That little bitch  took her from me on purpose!"</p><p>Murdock  admired his ability to keep a straight face during the demoness' little rant.  "It is a shame what happened to her. But we do have business to attend  to," Murdock stated as he tapped the briefcase that her had brought with  him. Personally, he found this method of exchange a bit melodramatic, but he  was acting under orders. The needless micromanaging really got on his nerves;  fortunately, the fringe benefits made up for a lot of it.</p><p>"I am  aware of that, and I am pleased that your associates were able to supply the  requested information so quickly. As I trust you will be pleased with what I  will give-" the demoness was interrupted by a ringing coming from within  her purse.</p><p>Murdock  suppressed a sigh as the woman answered her cell phone.</p><p>"Helen  what's wrong?" Alexia asked. Her dark green eyes hardened in rage at her  minion's response. "Kill them all then! Damn that redhead! What do you  mean; they're coming in too fast? There's over twenty of you there! Organize  and hunt them down! Hello? Helen answer me!" The blonde slammed her phone  onto the table in frustration.</p><p>"What's  going on?" Murdock asked in a concerned voice, as his hand reached for the  briefcase. He had a fair idea what had happened.</p><p>"My  brood is being killed off by the traitor and her human lackeys," Alexia  snarled.</p><p>"And  one of them called you here?" the grey-eyed man asked in exasperation. She  really was a stupid creature. "I'm sorry I have to go," he said as he  stood and put on his wide-brimmed hat.</p><p>"Why  are you leaving? We're not done here."</p><p>"Yes,  we are. If you're lucky WIC was not monitoring mobile transmissions in that  sector. If you're unlucky they've traced the phone call and found out your  current location," the mage explained as he grabbed the briefcase and held  it at his side.</p><p>"We  had a deal!" Alexia's control started to slip and her eyes began to flare.</p><p>Murdock  nodded solemnly. "Yes we had one. I'll be informing my associates of your  failure tonight. It was my fault for assuming you would be competent, or at  least be able to <i>conceal</i> your  base."</p><p>"You're  going to pay for this!" Alexia cried. She wanted to tear him apart for his  insolence, but the demoness knew that the mage would not be taken down that  easily.</p><p>"Undoubtedly,"  Murdock admitted honestly. He could not believe he had failed to expect that  something like this would happen. The plan was starting to depend more and more  on his backup plan succeeding. "Goodnight," Murdock said, tipping his  hat to the demoness. Turning so that his coat billowed out behind him, he  walked out of the restaurant.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"How'd  we do, Mommy?" Nariko asked as the trio of demons left the building they  had cleared.</p><p>"Hello  Ranma," Kasumi said from outside. Her team's stance was more relaxed and  her weapon was pointed at the ground.</p><p>The redhead  raised an eyebrow questioningly.</p><p>"You show  up as a Pattern D and a Pattern Silver," Kasumi explained, her eyes  twinkling in amusement. Not that anyone could see them behind her goggles.</p><p>"Oh,  okay."</p><p>"Any  wounded?" Kasumi asked. The brood looked okay.</p><p>"None,  thankfully. You?"</p><p>"Nope.  You find Alexia or anyone in charge?" the agent inquired.</p><p>"We  fought someone who seemed to be in charge, but she wasn't Alexia."</p><p>Kasumi  nodded. "No one else spotted a demon matching her description. At least  we've destroyed this base of hers."</p><p>The  redheaded demon what about to comment when she heard a young woman scream.  "What the Hell's that?"</p><p>"Do  you really want to know?" Lt. Tendo inquired, in a flat tone. In the  darkness her eyes were obscured behind her almost imperceptibly luminescent  goggles.</p><p>Ranma's glare  was answer enough.</p><p>"Okay,  but I think your kids should stay here," Kasumi warned.</p><p>The redhead  nodded, her sinking suspicion as to what the scream meant seemed to be more  correct. "Girls, go with Kasumi's men and find a place to wash up,"  Ranma said before she followed her fiancee to another building.</p><p>The agent  and the demon entered and walked down a battle-scarred hallway. Sailor DarkStar  stepped over the demonic fluids and body parts. The demoness could sense a  group of humans and a single succubus ahead. Her heart sank at the surety of  what she was about to see. They soon reached the warehouse's storage room.  Unlike the other rooms in the building, the lights were on.</p><p>The agents  had set themselves up in a large open space towards the center of the room.  Three WIC soldiers had positioned themselves near the edges of the room, while  another pair was much closer in and had their weapons directly trained on their  target.   Standing near that pair of  agents was the officer that Ranma's mother had talked to. Captain Jarvis had  pulled his goggles up onto his helmet and Ranma could see that the agent's  dark-blue eyes were fixed on readying a syringe. "I should apologize.  While our methods are not as elegant as your mistress', they're all we have,"  Jarvis explained.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar's attention was on the person Jarvis was talking to. She was a fairly  young succubus, not too much older than Nariko and a bit less powerful. The  demoness' wings, arms, legs, and tail were bound using shackles of an unusually  strong and resilient alloy. Her long, bright green hair was matted with her own  blood, as was her sparse leather dress.</p><p>Ranma noted  several large tears in the membranes of the captive's wings, numerous wounds in  her chest and arms that were healing with agonizing slowness, and that one of  her horns had nearly been sheared off. The redhead shuddered at that. She knew  how sensitive her horns were and could not imagine what having one almost torn  off would feel like.</p><p>It took the  green-haired succubus a bit longer to notice the visitors. At first her large  forest-green eyes looked at the other demon pleadingly and she made a weak  mewling noise. Then she noticed who it was standing before her.</p><p>It was the  traitor; the redheaded bitch who had lead these <i>humans</i> against her own kind. No doubt, she was here to gloat,  torture and to eventually turn her. The demoness' snarled as she tried to break  out of her bonds.</p><p>Ranma  cringed at the pitiful sight before her. The succubus was too weak to even make  her eyes glow uniformly. All that she could generate was an uneven green  flicker. "What the hell? I can't believe you ruthless bastards!"  Ranma exclaimed.</p><p>"She  may have information as to where Alexia went off to," Jarvis said as he  cautiously injected the demoness. She tried to struggle away but the bonds were  too strong and she was too weak.</p><p>"So  you decide it's just okay to torture her?" The redhead and her brood had  slaughtered the enemy, but at least those deaths were fairly quick.</p><p>"Not  physically," Jarvis counted. He then noted Ranma's skepticism. "The  demon got wounded during battle. That's how we were able to capture her.  Besides drugs are more effective than physical pain for information  gathering."</p><p>Ranma  looked at the dying demoness. It was probably for the best that her brood did  not get the chance to take prisoners. "It's still wrong," the redhead  said as she considered what she should do.</p><p>"There  is a way she would tell us everything rather quickly," Jarvis proposed.</p><p>"No,  I'm not going to turn anyone unless they ask for it," Ranma said as she  looked at the green-haired girl. "Just make it quick," the redhead  said as she stood by to watch Jarvis get to work.</p><p>Ranma  watched the short procedure carefully. If the agent went too far she'd kill the  demon herself, and maybe even the agent too, but she did want to know where  Alexia was. It turned out to be mercifully short. The young succubus did not  know anything and was put down.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar carried the body out of the warehouse and gingerly put it with the  others of Alexia's brood. The redhead took comfort in the pain she had for the  fallen.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>Assembly of  Man Acolyte Ryoga Hibiki's partner observed the operation from a concealed position  near a bridge abutment on the highway that ran next to the light industrial  park. She pushed back a lock of brown hair that had fallen in front of her  starlight scope.</p><p>Her  partner's powers were a double-edged sword. While they gave him increased strength  and endurance, rapid healing, a protective aura, and an ability to track  demons, they also made him show up on WIC scanners. There was another drawback,  one that only she thought of as one.</p><p>Everyone  else seemed to think that the increased loyalty, dedication, and obedience to  the Assembly was a good thing, that the blind fanaticism her partner showed  were signs of a promising young acolyte not of those of someone being  corrupted.</p><p>At first the Assembly seemed like a  godsend. They would give her new powers and skills and all they asked for was  that she would destroy evil. The Assembly even promised to look into finding  the people who dishonored her. However, as time passed she started to doubt the  morals and goals of her organization, and regret ever joining.</p><p>It had  taken several embarrassing mission failures for the Assembly to realize that  their more powerful operatives could be detected by that rival organization.  This was why the young Assemblywoman had to observe their target alone. It  seemed that the redhead was closely linked to the Company.</p><p>The  observer considered abandoning her post, walking over to an agent, and...  Surrendering. The Company had its faults, but at least they were not a cult.  She could be valuable to WIC. She had codes. She had names. She had locations.  She had information.</p><p>She had a  responsibility to her partner.</p><p>Ukyou  Kuonji sighed. Her defection could wait. She still harbored a secret hope that  she could get her partner to go with her, and that the Company might even be  able to help him. At the very least she wanted to settle things with that  redhead, and figure out exactly what had happened to the childhood friend that  had betrayed her.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>"Where's  my little sister?" Nabiki asked the redheaded demon slumped on the living  room couch. The past few days had been most odd for her. Seeing her sister as a  nudist-lesbian-bimbo was very distracting. Annoyingly, she was not allowed to  tell anyone anything about this. She knew that tempting her older sister or her  younger sister's... mother was not a good idea.</p><p>"Akane  and her mate are up in her room putting away clothing," Ranma said as she  stretched her neck.</p><p>"No  doubt having some sort of weird demon sex."</p><p>"Good  for them, show's they're in love and healthy," Ranma replied.</p><p>"Uhhh...  right... healthy" Nabiki shuddered at the image of Akane and what used to  be Tatewaki all claws, wings, and tails rolling around doing unspeakable acts.  God knew she had heard them doing it often enough.</p><p>"Normally,  I'd be willing to tell you all about how our bodies work. But I'm not in the  mood for it right now," Ranma sighed, as she replayed the day's events in  her head. She <i>hoped</i> that her kids  would do something to unwind. The redhead knew her body could benefit from some  relaxation.</p><p>Both girls  turned their heads upward in response to the sound of a door being opened and  someone running down the upstairs hallway. The person then rushed down the  stairs in just a handful of steps.</p><p>The  redhead's eyes widened when she saw who was coming at her. Nariko leapt up onto  her mother and hugged the slightly taller woman in fright.</p><p>"Nari-chan,  what's wrong?" Ranma asked as she comforted the girl.</p><p>"Akane  was putting away her new clothes, but she had to make room for her closet for  the new outfits. We started talking about her old clothes and she started to  get mad." The younger succubus spoke in a scared, halting tone.</p><p>"Then  what happened?"</p><p>"She  yelled at me! She told me to get out! Mommy, what's wrong with her?"  Nariko asked.</p><p>00000000000000000</p><p>A naked  blue-haired demon sat on the floor crying softly. She did not want to scare her  mate away. She loved the crimson-eyed succubus and wished she was here. She had  manifested her true form including her claws. The girl looked through her long,  transparent blue talons and her sobs increased.</p><p>She had  killed and drained today, and worse she had fed. The taste of... of Laura was  still in her mouth. She was a cannibal. A gentle knocking on the door got her  attention. "Go away," she said in-between sobs.</p><p>"Akane,  it's me Mommy," Ranma said.</p><p>"Mommy,"  Akane muttered. She felt herself starting to feel better in her mother's  presence. Akane then noticed the end of her tail. "No! You're not my  Mommy! She's dead. You're just some... thing!"</p><p>Ranma leaned  on the door, amazed at how much those words hurt. "Let me in, we can talk  about this," the redhead pleaded. "I really don't want to force you  to do this."</p><p>Akane  looked at the doorway. Every part of her being was urging her to open the door,  to let Mommy in. She stood and shambled to the door. Opening it she nearly fell  onto her mother and renewed her sobbing.</p><p>Holding  onto her daughter, Ranma looked into the girl's eyes. With a free hand she went  to Akane's left horn and gently stroked it. The blue-haired demon's eyes  dilated and her crying stopped. A small smile even formed on her lips and a  purr-like rumble started to form within her.</p><p>Continuing  the stimulation, Ranma lead Akane to her bed. The redhead then had her sit down  next to her. The brood mother stopped the rubbing and started to wait.</p><p>"What,  what was that?" Akane asked as she pulled out of the bliss filled haze.  "I knew these were sensitive, but that..."</p><p>"I'm  your mother," Ranma said in explanation. "Sorry I had to do that, but  I didn't know what else to do."</p><p>"Another  inhuman thing I do," Akane sighed. She wanted to cry but she found it hard  to while leaning on mother.</p><p>"Yes.  Is that what's wrong?" the redhead asked. "You're upset that you're  no longer human."</p><p>"Not  just that. That until now I haven't seen anything wrong about what I am!"</p><p>"But  you are now. That's good," Ranma said as she put an arm around Akane.  "You're recovering. You're turning back to yourself."</p><p>"No  I'm not! I'm still a winged-freak. I'm still a killer. I'm even stuck with that  feeble-minded girl."</p><p>Ranma  raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"I'm  sorry. I shouldn't have said that about Nari-chan. I shouldn't have yelled at  her. She's the sweetest, nicest, most beautiful person I've ever met,"  Akane apologized, ashamed at what she had said about her mate.</p><p>"See,  some good came out of your change," Ranma reassured.</p><p>"That's  not so bad. What's bad is what Nariko and I were going to do. We were about to  have sex, in celebration of today. What kind of monster does that after killing  and eating their own kind?"</p><p>"It's  part of our nature," Ranma sadly said. "And we can't fight our  nature, not completely. Look at me. I'm a guy, but I'm also your mother. I'm a  demon. So are you. We don't have to be evil, but we do have to do some  things."</p><p>"I'm  afraid... afraid of liking- No I <i>already</i>  like it, even love it a bit. Sinking my teeth in her neck and then licking the  blood off my hands," the blue-haired demon cried.</p><p>"You're  afraid that it will control you. That you'll turn into an unthinking beast that  simply hunts."</p><p>Akane  nodded.</p><p>"The  Akane of yesterday didn't care about killing. She didn't care about her  humanity. But you're not that Akane, are you?"</p><p>"But  I'm still... I'm still..."</p><p>Ranma  squeezed her daughter again. "Yes, you're still a demon. But you're not a  monster."</p><p>"Thanks,  Mother," Akane said. "What's wrong?" she asked seeing the  strange expression on the redhead's face.</p><p>Ranma  smiled as ran her hand through her daughter's hair. "I'm so proud of  you," she said before kissing her daughter lightly on the cheek.</p><p>"Mother,  what's this for?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Say  my name again," the redhead beamed.</p><p>"You're  my mother, so?"</p><p>"It  used to be Mommy didn't it?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Well,  I'm not some little kid; I'm sixteen years old," Akane said before pausing  in realization. "Oh, I <i>was</i> a  little kid. Wasn't I?"</p><p>Akane's  mother nodded.</p><p>"Poor  Nariko." Akane could now understand what had happened to her mate and how  bad it was. Nariko would never have a break-through like this. To her Ranma  will always be Mommy.</p><p>"We'll  do our best to help her," Ranma reassured. "Having a mate like you  really helps."</p><p>"And  you're doing a wonderful job as our mother," Akane smiled.</p><p>"Now,  I've got a favor to ask you," Ranma stated as she looked at her reflection  in a mirror on the wall. The fight and the discussion with her daughter had  both increased the number of violet flecks in her eyes. They were now a third  of the area of her irises.</p><p>"What  Mother?"</p><p>"Could  you help me –well- learn how to be... or at least pretend to be... a  girl," the redhead blurted out. "Sure I know how to be a sexy  demoness-"</p><p>"Well,  that's easy," Akane laughed.</p><p>"Yes  it is," Ranma laughed. "Sometimes TOO easy."</p><p>"I'm  honored, but why Mother?" Akane asked. She was a bit nervous about the  prospect of having to teach Mother, but she was in awe of the responsibility.</p><p>"I'm a  Mother. I should know something. Also it'll help you too," Ranma  explained. "Now go and get dressed."</p><p>Akane  looked down to see her nude form. "I'm sorry, Mother," she  apologized, her pale skin blushing just a hint. She then got up, made her  wings, horns, and tail vanish, and went to her closet.</p><p>"Its  okay, Honey," Ranma laughed. She had no problems seeing her children in  the nude.</p><p>"How's  this? Akane asked after she had gotten dressed. She was wearing a yellow floral  print mini-skirt and a spaghetti strap top with a bare midriff. On her feet was  a pair of leather boots.</p><p>"It's  very nice," the redhead said smiling. It was more clothing than her  daughter had been willing to wear since she'd been turned. It might not be as  much as she wore when she was human, but it was a start. "Come on, let's  go downstairs and make up with Nariko."</p><p>"Can  we go out and get some dinner?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Sure,  ours <i>was</i> interrupted," Ranma  replied, happy at the day's progress.</p><p>End Chapter 8</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Prereaders for this chapter have been. Kevin D Hammel, Bill Heineman, Black  Dragon, Jerry Jordan, Wray Lofin, Mike Koos, and Joe Fenton.</p><p>Very heartfelt thanks goes to Bill Heineman  for all of his help on this project. Unfortunately, I can't tell you exactly  what he's done. That would contain innumerable spoilers.</p><p>Wert</p>
