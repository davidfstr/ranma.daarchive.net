</div><p>The Return</p><p>A Ranma Sailor Moon fic thingy.</p><p>By Josh Temple</p><p>Naturally, I own neither Sailor Moon nor Ranma. So here's  the disclaimer</p><p>Ranma 1/2 and its characters and settings belong to Rumiko  Takahashi, Shogakukan, Kitty, and Viz Video. Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon  belongs to Naoko Takeuchi, Koudansha, TV Asahi, and Toei Douga, and DIC.</p><p>Previous chapters and other works can be found at my  fanfiction website.</p><p>http:/jtemple. website Temple of Ranma's Senshi as always is wanted.</p><p>Chapter 16 Retrograde and Remade Part 2</p><p>"Did you know about Ami  and Naru?" Usagi carefully asked.</p><p>"Well, no not as  such," Setsuna demurred, she made sure to keep her eyes on the road. Last  night she had returned from an unproductive interview to find four irate and  shocked Senshi. Setsuna was shocked herself once the situation was explained to  her.</p><p>"You didn't find anything  odd about their secret meetings, all the time they spent with each other?"  Usagi stretched in the passenger seat of the Dodge Charger.</p><p>"None of you saw anything  too odd about it. You just thought they were sneaking off to study, try to date  boys, and finally date each other." Setsuna glowered. It was a wonderful  cover. A lesbian relationship nicely explained Janet and Ami being secretive  and any nervousness when questioned about their nighttime activities.</p><p>"You're supposed to know  better than us. We're just teenagers."</p><p>"I was cautious about  Janet, but I cleared her, and she was an exemplary Senshi. You and the rest liked  her, and Ami said she was clean."</p><p>"That's because she was  Naru." Usagi sighed sadly. "Damn Murdock! First he kills my boyfriend  and then he corrupts my friends. Look at what he did to Naru and Ami."</p><p>"We're going to find him.  He will be punished." Setsuna promised. They had all been violated.  Getting Ami was quite the coup.</p><p>"So, how did you miss  this?" Usagi asked again.</p><p>Setsuna hesitated before  speaking. "I watched Janet at the start, checked her out. Reviewed it when  Ami and Janet started to bond. There was nothing. Janet was clean. She seemed  as legitimate as the rest of you." She sighed. "I can't watch  everyone."</p><p>"How'd he do this then?  How do we get them back?"</p><p>"Murdock is patient,  remember that. He had Naru living as Janet at least as far back as Mamoru's  death, and then think of the months that Naru was among us. Slow and  deliberate."</p><p>"Why? Wasn't DarkStar his  first plan?"</p><p>"This might have been his  backup, or maybe Sailor DarkStar was just misdirection. Some flash to draw  attention from the real culprit."</p><p>"So how do we get them  back?"</p><p>Setsuna smiled weakly.  "That's your department. You're the best at saving and healing  people."</p><p>"I just..." Usagi  stared out the window at the passing buildings. "At least with Ami I know  I can reach her. It's not as bad as when the others went bad."</p><p>"That's actually  worse," Setsuna corrected.</p><p>"But she still cares for  me. She doesn't hate me."</p><p>"Do you really want the  affection of a dark Senshi?" Setsuna asked.</p><p>Usagi's mind briefly flashed  to Mercury and Ranma with herself in the middle.</p><p>"Princess?"</p><p>"Huh?" A blush crept  up on Usagi's face as she cleared her head.</p><p>"Ami's dangerous. Naru by her own admission was turned  by Murdock, and Naru then got to Ami. They want you."</p><p>"It won't work. Ami won't  be some puppet," Usagi promised.</p><p>"I wasn't there last  night, but you were." Setsuna slowed to a stop at a red light. She looked  around with some nervousness. "Were those the actions of the Ami you  know?"</p><p>"Well, Ami always  complained about my schoolwork or being late, and recently she'd been harping  about our training." Usagi laughed bitterly.</p><p>"It's different now. You  shouldn't be alone any of you." Setsuna sighed. It was good advice, but  Ami had proven it ineffective last night, though they were surprised. It was  troubling. If they had followed Ami's advice they would have been training and  maybe the girls would be getting more skilled.</p><p>All under Ami's guidance of  course. Ami could do research and come up with the best plans, maybe even a few  magical spells to help unlock the next stage of their Senshi powers. Setsuna  shook her head; it was paranoid, but it made sense. If Ami was going to corrupt  and control the Senshi from the inside, the guise of training did the job.</p><p>"At least you've warmed  up to Ranma," Usagi allowed.</p><p>"I'm approving of this  meeting because you've been too distant from her. Ranma's made her own friends  and alliances and is self-sufficient."</p><p>"Is that bad?"</p><p>Setsuna shifted gears and  changed lanes before responding. "It shows good initiative. She can be a  powerful ally, but remember last night. You said Ami and her were very  chummy."</p><p>"Ranma is a demon, and  they didn't try to fight each other."</p><p>"Yes." Setsuna  noticed Usagi's incomprehension. "Take it this way. Do you want Mercury to  get closer to Ranma? What if she convinces Ranma that you are weak and you do  need to be trained?"</p><p>Usagi looked down. "She  already thinks that about us. She called us amateurs."</p><p>Setsuna snorted. "Even  though you've been doing this longer, saved the world more times, and faced  hardships she can't even begin to understand."</p><p>Usagi slumped further into her  seat. "That's what makes Ami so hard. She was with me since the start. She  knows we've gotten much better but..."</p><p>"But nothing. Ami's been  manipulated ever since Janet showed up. You can't trust what she says."</p><p>"It's not that  simple." Usagi felt the anxiety from last night return. "Ami's made  sure of that."</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"I just think that Nabiki  should make her own decision," Ranma said to her fiancee as the two  window-shopped.</p><p>"All I'm saying is that  she can handle high school. Her mind's the same, by treating her like the youngest  you're <i>making</i> her the youngest,"  Kasumi explained.</p><p>"She <i>is</i> the youngest. Alexia turned her last," Ranma pointedly  stated.</p><p>"Yes, but she needs to  recover. Encouraging this juvenile cutesiness, it's not Nabiki."</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow.  "It's not the Nabiki you remember, but it's who she is now."</p><p>"Akane came back."</p><p>The redhead stared at  the dark blue leather gown on display. "Her age wasn't reduced and if  anything she's more aggressive."</p><p>"And there were lesbian  rumors back when she was human too," Kasumi deadpanned.</p><p>"Must run in the  family," Ranma gave Kasumi's butt a playful touch before wrapping her arm  around the taller woman's waist. "And don't think I'm mad, I really like  that you're getting interested in our girls."</p><p>Kasumi looked down and mulled  over the demon's last two words. "Yes, I do care about my sisters,"  she clarified.</p><p>"I've been working with  Ukyou to find out what her Senshi powers are." Ranma leaned onto the  taller woman.</p><p>"Any luck?" Kasumi  asked, surprised at the increased weight Ranma was putting on her.</p><p>"Maybe, it's odd.  Something keeps her from using it in practice. I know it's there. She knows it  too, but she won't cast it."</p><p>"How are the others  shaping up?"</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Getting  more accuracy and speed. Nariko's got some control issues."</p><p>"I noticed. She's still  burning more than one tree."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "And  Nabiki's really tires her out, but it does use a lot to cast."</p><p>"Worried about this  Mizuno thing?"</p><p>"Nope." Ranma then  nuzzled her head onto Kasumi's side and chest.</p><p>Blushing Kasumi coughed, but  after finding that ineffective at dislodging the demon, she sighed. "Why  not?"</p><p>"I don't think she's a  threat to me," Ranma murmured.</p><p>"Don't you have a  plan?" Kasumi decided to put a hand around the redhead's shoulder. At  least then they would not be so lopsided.</p><p>"Yeah, slowly getting you  used to public displays of affection."</p><p>Kasumi sniffed and turned her  head.</p><p>"Women," Ranma  muttered.</p><p>"Oh don't play that  card." Kasumi taunted. "Who's the one wearing pants instead of a  dress? We won't even discuss hairstyles, makeup or jewelry."</p><p>"I wear pants."</p><p>"That aren't shiny  sprayed-on leather?"</p><p>"I've gotta look  good."</p><p>"You're a succubus,"  Kasumi quietly said. "You'd look good in anything."</p><p>Ranma laughed. "So you  think Usagi'll blow me off? Is she even gonna bother coming?"</p><p>Kasumi maintained a straight  face and wondered if she was reading too much into what Ranma had just said.  "Observation teams did see Setsuna pick her up not too long ago."</p><p>"Mercury could already  have attacked and taken them," Ranma walked over to the next display for  the store and looked at a selection of leather boots.</p><p>"Possible, we don't know  what kind of style Mizuno will use." Kasumi looked at the shiny glass.</p><p>"I'm curious. She has a  lot of options for 'evil schemes'." Ranma's smile increased slightly.</p><p>"They're here,"  Kasumi tried to pull herself away.</p><p>"Spotted their  reflection?" Ranma released her hold on the officer's waist to slide  herself up against Setsuna, who had just walked up on the pair. "Oh nice  Usagi," she purred as she eyed the blonde. "You brought a  friend."</p><p>"Don't you have a  girlfriend now?" Setsuna eyed the short demon inches from her.</p><p>"Oh her, she's  cool." Ranma cooed.</p><p>"Yeah, got the suit and  dark sunglasses and everything." Kasumi flatly said.</p><p>Usagi tilted her head.  "That's not a suit. Sure the blouse and pants count, but your jacket is  too casual, and your glasses are on your head."</p><p>Kasumi sighed. "Not all  secret agents wear black suits, trench coats and fedoras or slinky dresses."</p><p>"Your girlfriend  does," Setsuna said while staring at Ranma.</p><p>Ranma winked. "Come on,  have a taste, you know you want to."</p><p>"I think you're more  effective when you're not so blatant," Kasumi commented wryly.</p><p>"Yeah, that's how I got  you." Ranma winked at her, and then turned to Usagi. "So what do you  want to talk about? You set this meeting up before the Ami and Janet  stuff."</p><p>"Naru," Usagi  forcefully corrected.</p><p>"Sorry," Ranma's  eyes flicked to Setsuna's harsh gaze before returning to the blonde. "So  what do you want to talk about?"</p><p>"Maybe... we should...  private?" Usagi's stumbling sequence of words appeared to end in a  question.</p><p>"Uh, let's try the  store," Ranma said.</p><p>Usagi's eyes caught the skimpy  black leather gown on display. "Yeah..."</p><p>Before entering Ranma turned  to Kasumi. "I'm sure you and Setsy can have some fun."</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll be  safe with Ranma," Usagi assured.</p><p>"Uh... right,"  Setsuna said to the retreating Senshi. "So, how is it, being mated to  Ranma?" she then asked Kasumi.</p><p>"We're not mates,"  Lieutenant Tendo firmly said.</p><p>"Oh," Setsuna  coughed and looked ahead. She never could relate to common soldier; they were  too practical. Lords and ladies, especially those with hereditary military  titles, were so much easier to handle.</p><p>Kasumi kept watch and made  sure her earpiece was working. Whiz-kids like Meiou were nothing but trouble.  They loved overcomplicated plans that showed how clever they were.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"Well?" Ranma asked  as she tried on a set of gloves.</p><p>"I think we need to work  together." Usagi flinched, expecting the demon to laugh her off.</p><p>"I'm listening,"  Ranma said in an apathetic tone that made Usagi flex her hands in frustration.</p><p>"We should work together.  You've got a team of Senshi, I've got a team of Senshi," Usagi quietly  explained.</p><p>"Yours is smaller now.  Got any plans to fix that?" Ranma slipped the gloves off and then looked  at another pair.</p><p>Usagi's eyes hardened.  "I'm going to free them and punish Murdock."</p><p>"That's a goal, but I  asked you about plans." Ranma picked up another set of gloves and sighed.  "Really, metal studs in gloves. That'll chafe and look really dumb."</p><p>"Yeah, that is  stupid." Usagi frowned. "Anyway, that is my plan."</p><p>Ranma rubbed the bridge of her  nose. "No... you need more than that. You just can't count on stumbling  onto the enemy or waiting for them to find you."</p><p>"It's worked before, and  we've managed to find enemy bases before." Usagi's voice became  despondent. "Of course Ami was a big help on that stuff; we can't count on  her now."</p><p>"Sure you can,"  Ranma chuckled. "Ami seemed plenty sharp last night."</p><p>"She knew we needed  her," Usagi looked to Ranma.</p><p>"At least you still have  Setsuna," Ranma mirthfully offered.</p><p>Usagi became quiet and watched  as Ranma tried on some boots. "It's all because of you," the blonde  said.</p><p>Ranma looked up from the  shin-high motorcycle boots. "Oh? Ain't my fault. You guys would have  eventually figured it out." She started unbuckling the boots. "Or  not."</p><p>"You're wrong,"  Usagi's voice had once again hardened.</p><p>Ranma looked up.</p><p>"We wouldn't have figured  it out. You saw it. Setsuna's paranoia's to the outside, and the rest of us  rely on Ami."</p><p>Ranma shrugged.</p><p>"Ami could have strung us  along on that Mistress Lyra scheme. Rei still thinks Ami's being controlled by  Lyra." Usagi's voice became frantic. "Don't you see? If you hadn't  seen Virgo..."</p><p>"Ami would still be your <i>friend</i>,  and you would be spending today figuring out how to fight a nonexistent  enemy," Ranma said without making eye contact as she slipped the boots  off. "I'd expect Ami to carefully and steadily draw you girls in. Maybe  into an ambush where you could be neutralized, maybe just corrupted over time,  or maybe even take all of you out while you sleep."</p><p>Usagi shivered. "She was  our roommate. She would often sneak in late at night. We were used to it. You  saved us all." Her voice was hardly a whisper.</p><p>"I was just following a  lead. Minako was the one that connected Ami to a super villain." Ranma put  her own boots back on. "And it was Ami who said 'Hell with this' and  revealed herself."</p><p>"Well, thank you  anyway." Usagi hesitated. Overcoming the fear and indecision, she then  gently hugged the startled demon. The blonde expected an apprehensive response,  not an enthused and engaged one.</p><p>Adding her arms to the hug,  Ranma eased into Usagi's embrace. She was on the brink of purring when she got  interrupted.</p><p>"Awww, that's  adorable," a taunting voice behind Usagi said.</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened. "I  didn't expect you here." She then smirked. "And you brought your  friend too."</p><p>Usagi froze. The voice did not  sound like Ami or Naru. The blonde turned her head and saw only a Japanese  brunette and a Caucasian blonde with short hair.</p><p>"Hi Sam! Hey Naoko!"  Ranma enthusiastically greeted while she still hugged Usagi. "You girls  finally get the courage to shop here?"</p><p>Naoko blushed. "Uh, no.  We were just walking past when we noticed your old girlfriend standing next to  Akane's older sister."</p><p>"Old girlfriend?"  Usagi asked, before she pulled her arms back and escaped the hug.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "There's  this rumor that Setsuna stood me up on a few dates or something."</p><p>"Yes, poor Sunny had her  delicate heart torn from her chest." Sam said with a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>"Figuratively of  course," Naoko added.</p><p>Sam appraised her pale friend.  "I'd imagine it's the other way when it comes to literally though."</p><p>Ranma blushed.</p><p>Usagi blinked. "No...  Setsuna never dated Sunshine. She's dating Kasumi."</p><p>"Kasumi? Nice  going." Sam gave Ranma a friendly nudge. "I never knew she was into  the lipstick lesbians."</p><p>Sam laughed. "Why not?  You've seen Akane and her new girlfriend."</p><p>"Yeah, I guess the  Tendo's really like sweet, gentle, and feminine Goth girls."</p><p>"I thought I was brooding  and dark," Ranma pouted.</p><p>"Oh no, you're cuddly and  sensitive." Sam eyed Ranma's leather skirt. "You just dress like the  main squeeze to a Hell's Angel."</p><p>"Oh careful. You don't  want to get Kasumi mad," Naoko teased.</p><p>"Now, now, she's very  nice."</p><p>"Makes sense that you'd  like strong women," Sam appraised. "She seemed stern and a bit  scary."</p><p>"So when are you going  back to school?" Naoko asked.</p><p>"You still have those  family issues?" Sam added.</p><p>Ranma looked down. "No  my... cousin's... gone."</p><p>"I'm sorry, I didn't  know. Did she at least die peacefully."</p><p>"Nope." Ranma tried  very hard and managed to conceal her smirk.</p><p>"Are you okay,  Sunny?" Naoko put her hand to Ranma's shoulder, and drew her friend into a  hug. Sam quickly joined.</p><p>"Yeah, but it hit some of  the family pretty hard. We're only now... ready."</p><p>"Will you be back into  school tomorrow?" Sam asked after the hug finished.</p><p>Ranma nodded.</p><p>"What about Nabiki? I  know it was a family thing, as she was out too." Sam noticed that Nariko  was out too, but that made some sense. The Kunos were close to both the Saotomes  and Tendos.</p><p>"She's transferred.  Different school."</p><p>"The same one that  Tatewaki transferred too?" Sam asked with a hint of skepticism.</p><p>"Uh, I think so."  Ranma hated lying to her fiends, especially when they were poor lies.</p><p>"So how are you  doing?" Naoko asked Usagi, purposefully ignoring Ranma's questionable  statements.</p><p>"Well... I..." Usagi  was at a loss. How come a predatory brood mother could relate to these girls,  but someone as straightforward as a magical princess could not?</p><p>"One of her friends is  being a real pain." Ranma verbally stepped in. "There's also some  problems with another old friend of Usagi's. She really feels betrayed by the  whole thing."</p><p>"Mind if we ask  who?" Sam inquired.</p><p>"I can trust you two on  this?"</p><p>"Of course," Sam  said, not bothering to hide her hurt.</p><p>"Sorry," Ranma  looked to Usagi who gave a vague motion that might have been consent.  "It's Ami. Ami Mizuno."</p><p>Naoko thought for a bit while  Sam looked at something that was suspiciously similar to a whip. "It's  about Janet too, isn't it?"</p><p>"Naoko, you can't think  every essentially inseparable pair of girls that are friends is a lesbian  couple. That's how rumors start," Sam reprimanded. "I'll admit, if  they were lesbians I wouldn't be shocked at all."</p><p>Usagi blinked.</p><p>Sam turned her attention back  to Ranma. "We should really hang out more."</p><p>"You and all your Gothy  friends," Naoko teased.</p><p>"Sure, we could go to a  bar or a club. I'd be fun." Ranma gave a saucy smile. She noticed the  amused blushes on her friends and recalled exactly what she said.. "Oh!  It! I meant to say "It" would  be fun!"</p><p>"I'm sure you would be  fun," Sam teased.</p><p>"Maybe we should pick  something out for you girls to wear?" Ranma asked with a blush. "This  is the perfect store for making an impression."</p><p>"I bet Ami shops here now  too," Usagi muttered.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "This is a  classy place," she said as she looked through the leather bikini tops.</p><p>"You could get us into a  bar?" Naoko asked.</p><p>"Sure. It's easy."  Ranma held up the bikini. The metal chains connecting the cups and providing  straps seemed far too gaudy.</p><p>"Hmm, okay." Sam  assumed that Sunshine got in using her charms and her "mature"  physique.</p><p>"Do you wanna come  too?" Naoko asked a dejected looking Usagi.</p><p>"I, well, I've got to get  things straightened out with Ami first."</p><p>Naoko shrugged.</p><p>"Sorry to hear that,  maybe next time," Sam said.</p><p>"What about our  thing?" Usagi asked Ranma, irritation entering her depressed voice.</p><p>"Oh yeah, I'll help you  with Ami when you want," Ranma said as she picked out a set of leather  pants and handed them to an embarrassed Naoko. "Just remember the kind of  help that I'll give."</p><p>"Er, yeah." Usagi  hesitated. "I just, I need to save her." She looked at Ranma's two  friends. "From herself."</p><p>Naoko looked at Usagi with an unreadable  expression on her face for a brief moment. "If you say so."</p><p>Sam leaned in close and  whispered into Ranma's ear. "I think you should help her," she looked  at her fellow blonde briefly. "She's in a sorry state, just help her. I'll  find something risque for Naoko to wear while you do it."</p><p>Ranma nodded and lead Usagi to  the opposite side of the store.</p><p>"They know?" Usagi  asked.</p><p>Ranma rolled her eyes.  "They know that you want my advice, and that it's something private. Look  you actually need a plan." She held up her hand, cutting Usagi off.  "And I don't mean wishing to free them. How long has Ami been on your  team?"</p><p>"She was the first,  before her-" Usagi's voice turned maudlin. "- it was just Naru. Then  more Senshi came, and we drifted apart."</p><p>"Then Ami knows <i>exactly</i>  how you fight." Ranma looked into Usagi's eyes. "You've got to take  the fight to her, you have to be proactive." The redhead paused to recall  the last word.</p><p>"You mean hunt her  down?"</p><p>Ranma smiled. "I knew you  could figure it out. Setsuna has her sources and the Company can help some.  Track her down by whatever means you can."</p><p>"Maybe Rei can get a  vision on her," Usagi pondered.</p><p>"And this time Ami won't  be there to interpret it for you."</p><p>"What about fights?"</p><p>Ranma paused. She was not sure  what to make about Usagi's tone. It was still depressed, but seemed somehow  expectant. "Those are chances to beat her, but she knows what you can do,  and she has that book."</p><p>"Maybe I should take out  Murdock first. Break the control." Usagi's hands clenched.</p><p>"Looks like the princess  has some anger in her after all." Ranma smirked. "And that's a great  idea. Take him out and the rest would be easier."</p><p>Usagi looked up and for a few  seconds they were clear and decisive. "You know what he did to me, to you.  He uses people, destroys their lives, warps their minds and bodies, kills them.  He will be punished," she echoed her words but this time with decisive  conviction.</p><p>"Sometimes you really are  your mother's daughter."</p><p>Usagi's gaze softened. "I  know. I'm afraid."</p><p>"Really? Why?" Ranma  stretched. "Things are going to be difficult. Accept that and move on.  Getting all worried will just waste time, time you can spend doing stuff."</p><p>"I know Ami's not wasting  her time." Usagi laughed bitterly. "Not then and not now."</p><p>"Then you should make  sure your girls don't waste their time." Ranma then looked to see Naoko  trying to get Sam a bright red PVC cat-suit. "That thing won't fit  her."</p><p>"I'm sorry I'm boring  you," Usagi grumbled.</p><p>"Well do you have  anything new to say?" Ranma turned back to the blonde. "I like this  assertive side you're starting to show. Hell, you are their commander, act like  it."</p><p>Usagi nodded slowly.  "Well, I should go. Setsuna wants to talk with the others. I'll tell them  my plan then. Thanks for the help." She gave the demoness a quick hug  before leaving the store and reuniting with Setsuna.</p><p>"You're welcome,"  Ranma said as she watched the two Senshi leave. She wagered it would take more  to get Usagi to really learn, but she was starting to come around. Ranma  shrugged and returned to her friends.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"And here's where Silva  explains the parts of the succubus body," Nodoka said to the sleepy  succubae who lounged around her. The succubus reading primer had a cute picture  of Silva succubus pointing to a diagram of another succubus who had various  parts of her body labeled. Nodoka ran through the list of bodyparts: cornu,  caput, mamae, arma, cubitum, secus, femur, crus, and pes.</p><p>"Are you sure that's the  right pronunciation?" Nabiki asked as she nuzzled her grandmother's  shoulder.</p><p>"I took some Latin in  university and the start of this book has a pretty good pronunciation  guide." Nodoka shrugged. "But you really can't learn to pronounce a  language from books. At least you'll learn to recognize the symbols and be able  to read."</p><p>"That will let us read  the books Great-grandma gave us," Ukyou said. She then nudged Misako who  had started to doze off.</p><p>The green-eyed succubus  mumbled sleepily and tried to put her attention back to the book.</p><p>"There will be a quiz  when we're done," Nodoka reminded.</p><p>Misako pouted.</p><p>"At least it's not  grammar, well today." Akane corrected herself.</p><p>Nariko's red eyes perked up.</p><p>"But I thought you two  wanted to be proper succubae?" Nabiki innocently asked Akane and Misako.  "Learning our family's language and culture is a big part of that."</p><p>"That's right,"  Nodoka beamed as she turned to the next page. She was interrupted before she  could read the text that accompanied Silva standing with a larger and  older-looking demoness.</p><p>"Hi Mom!" Nariko  happily greeted.</p><p>Ranma froze and studied the  tableau. Her mother was in the middle of a pile of succubae as if it were the  most natural thing in the world. The redhead smirked, stripped, sat down, and  slid in. Moving off Nodoka's side to allow Ranma in, Akane then put her head on  her mother's lap.</p><p>"How was the  meeting?" Nodoka asked, as she hugged her daughter hello.</p><p>"Pretty good  really." Ranma stretched her arms. "There might actually be some hope  for Usagi - she was kinda decisive. Plus Sam and Naoko showed up, so I got to  help them shop."</p><p>"They pick out anything  fun?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Nothing too wild I'm  afraid, but it should look fun when they go out with us."</p><p>"We're going out?"  Misako's eyes twinkled. She had not visited a good club in a while.  "When?"</p><p>"Dunno, we can talk to  them at school. Work out the details. Maybe the Red Turtle. Though that place  can be a bit too mellow."</p><p>"Not on Wednesdays and  Fridays. They have live music those days. Ayanami says some of the acts are  pretty good." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Neat, that could work  then."</p><p>"What about me?"  Nabiki asked.</p><p>"What? You'll come of  course."</p><p>"Uh Mom, look at me. I  don't think I'll pass as nineteen as easily as the rest of you," Nabiki  dryly reminded.</p><p>"So? You've done the bar  thing before with Alexia."</p><p>"Don't remind me,"  Nabiki frowned.</p><p>"Sorry Honey," Ranma  reached over to comfort her. "I was just trying to say it's not something  to worry about."</p><p>"Well, what about Naoko  and Sam? They knew me from before, and I'm not like Akane. I can't just be  explained away by becoming a Goth-lesbian-punk-girl."</p><p>"Yeah, you're more of a  Gothic-Lolita-pink-lace-lesbian," Akane evaluated.</p><p>"Gee, thanks sis."</p><p>"Well, you're about half  a foot shorter, have a much more youthful face and a more slender physique,  save for your breasts. There's also how you dress and carry yourself now."  Ranma shrugged. "People will see a resemblance, but no one would think  you're Nabiki."</p><p>"I am Nabiki."</p><p>"You know what I  mean," Ranma could tell the hurt in her daughter's voice was feigned.  "You're still Yuki too. Your Senshi name is Sailor Yuki. Your fashion  style is like hers and you're trying to give me the puppy-dog eyes while making  your lower lip quiver."</p><p>"Our saccharine succubus  mom is supposed to submit to saturated sweetness," Nabiki remarked.</p><p>Ranma crossed her arms in  front of her chest. "You're as bad as Nari-chan, you know?"</p><p>"Given that she's the  reason you're the Mom you are today, that's a compliment."</p><p>"Cute," Ranma's  resistance crumbled and she scooped Nabiki in close, displacing Akane to her  side.</p><p>"We'll figure out  something for Sam and Naoko." Ranma put her arms around Nabiki.  "Though, I think they're pretty on the ball. They knew that Ami and Janet  were together."</p><p>"We should really find  them ourselves." Misako proposed as she snuggled onto Ukyou's chest.</p><p>"You just want to see her  corset in person," the blonde accused her mate.</p><p>"Yup!"</p><p>"I'm amazed that a human  Senshi could actually come up with a uniform that wasn't a fashion disaster.  Though all that ice over her crotch and ass can't be fun."</p><p>"You mean her secus and  pyga?" Nabiki teased.</p><p>"She probably likes the  cold," Ranma said as she slid more from her mother's side to her front.</p><p>"Should we go back to the  book?" Nodoka asked as she patted her daughter on the head, careful to  avoid her horns.</p><p>Despite this, Ranma still  purred and nuzzled her head. The motion caused Nodoka's bra to get out of  position.</p><p>"Sure, I think we're  ready," Nabiki said.</p><p>"Yeah," Nariko  agreed as she slid in behind Nodoka.</p><p>"Okay." As Nodoka  reopened the book and flipped to the next page she found herself easing  backwards. She then paused. "Nari-chan dear, can you please move your  tail. The tickling is distracting."</p><p>"Sorry," Nariko  blushed and adjusted herself.</p><p>"It's fine," Nodoka  tried to adjust her bra but found her daughter's head in the way.</p><p>"I can unhook it for  you?" Nariko helpfully offered. "Or give you a nice backrub?"</p><p>Nodoka considered. This  morning had been full of stressful hassles. Acquiring the necessary machining  equipment had been a pain. "Yes, that would be nice." She smiled as  Nariko went to work, and then resumed the reading.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"Mistress," Orion  gently interrupted the blue-haired Senshi, with her head bowed.</p><p>"Yes?" Mercury said  looking up from the display next to her. She then waved for Orion to rise to  her full height.</p><p>"It's about the meeting  between the Princess and DarkStar," Orion said.</p><p>"You weren't  spotted."</p><p>Orion was not sure whether her  Mistress had asked a question or made a statement. "Not that I know,"  she said, opting for the safe response.</p><p>Mercury's eyes darted back to  the display. She then typed in a few commands and leaned back in her, modest,  throne. "You placed the probe before they had arrived."</p><p>"Yes," Orion eyed  the comfortable and unadorned high-backed chair. She had expected a more  foreboding structure, but upon reflection Orion reevaluated her view. Mistress  Mercury would never be one to rely on some piece of furniture to prove her  status. Similarly her hair was up in a simple bun, and her jewelry was Spartan  silver with ice gems.</p><p>"It's an interesting  challenge," Mercury mused. "How to make devices that are invisible to  Setsuna's meddling and to those human... observers."</p><p>"There's also the demons  and their senses," Orion respectfully added. This time it was easy to bug.  Mercury knew about the meeting and its location ahead of time.</p><p>Mercury smiled thinly.  "Yes, we must not forget them. So what do you think of their  conversation?"</p><p>"The Princess aims to  forge an alliance. I think she's resolved to take action against us."  Orion said carefully. She had seen what her Mistress was capable of, but knew  that a sycophantic evaluation would not be wise.</p><p>Mercury laughed and re-crossed  her legs. She idly adjusted the skirting to her dark blue silk evening dress.  "Interesting. She's making a plan, good. I would be very disappointed in  the Princess if she just sat back and took it."</p><p>Orion studied her mistress.  She swore that today's corset was a bit tighter, but more important was the  bust increase. Her eyes slid over to the statuary next to the throne.  Unsurprisingly, the detail was amazing.</p><p>Mercury started tapping her  manicured nails with deliberate impatience. "Are you enjoying your  view?"</p><p>"Oh yes Mistress,"  Orion blushed and bowed.</p><p>"I appreciate it, but  don't be too servile." Mercury snickered. "So the Princess aims to  fight? Good. I want her to learn from this."</p><p>"I would assume you'd  want the Princess to move into her chambers here sooner rather than later,"  Orion stated. The townhouse they were currently inhabiting, generously funded  by their backer, had ample room for all the Senshi.</p><p>"If things had gone  better last night she would have moved in here within a fortnight."  Mercury glowered. Her original plan was to leverage the Mistress Lyra <i>threat</i>  to get them to move into this newly acquired place.</p><p>Convincing Setsuna to make the  purchase would have been the hard part, but Mercury was sure that the others  would find this place irresistible. Once the Senshi were moved in she could  have initiated the next phase. Mercury sighed. Things would not be that easy.  She thanked her foresight in making contingency plans.</p><p>"The Princess will be  living here soon enough," Mercury promised.</p><p>"She is the most  sympathetic to our cause," Orion laughed.</p><p>"Maybe not," Mercury  said as she looked at her display again. "Maybe the Princess's new ally  would be more open to us." She turned to the statue and smiled.</p><p>"I think DarkStar would  approve," Orion remarked. Virgo did make a good objet d'art. The icy glaze  that kept the presentation in position added a new layer to the piece.</p><p>"Are you sure?"  Mercury frowned. "She prefers more... visceral punishments." She  stood up and walked the short distance, her heels clicking on the floor.</p><p>"Visceral?" Orion  asked, puzzling over the term's use. "She does like organs and is a more  emotional and instinctual creature."</p><p>Mercury smiled thinly.  "That and her enemies have the pleasure of being eviscerated as they're  being eaten, of course."</p><p>"Of course," Orion  agreed.</p><p>She caressed the frozen cheek  and smirked at the smoldering eyes. "I am not nearly so exuberant or  emotional in my desires. Physical pain is only part of it, and it would be such  a shame to ruin these nice hardwood floors."</p><p>"I think DarkStar would  understand that," Orion ventured as she walked closer to her mistress.</p><p>"I suppose," Mercury  looked Virgo up and down, her eyes lingering on Virgo's chest. She smirked.  "Have you learned your lesson?" she asked the purple-haired statue.</p><p>Virgo tried with all her will  to escape the icy prison. Physical strength proved ineffective, and her powers  had been controlled by Mercury. Her face could not even change its position.  She was stuck in an alluring pout.</p><p>Mercury put a gloved hand to her  lip in thought. "If not, I suppose I can start freezing your limbs. Would  that make things clear enough for you?"</p><p>"Would you like to resume  training or have dinner?" Orion asked, turning away from the icy statue.</p><p>"Well, Virgo is currently  indisposed, and will be for a while," Mercury frowned. Virgo was a good  trainer and a fair cook too.</p><p>"We could train with the  caster. I had just finished testing the room's shielding," Orion offered. Before  she planted the bug she had been working in that basement room. "There  won't be any magical leakage."</p><p>"While it was nice of our  benefactor to furnish us with that facility, I am disappointed by the  capabilities it had," Ami said as she smiled inwardly. Just a few short  months ago the caster was nearly impossible, and now...</p><p>"We did just finish  upgrading the caster's power," Orion reminded.</p><p>"Yes," Mercury  turned to Orion. "Are you sure about the shielding?"</p><p>"Planning to go all out  tonight?" Orion asked with a smirk. "And yes, it's checked out and  ready."</p><p>"Good, I don't want  anybody to sniff out my efforts," Mercury laughed.</p><p>"Would you like dinner  before hand? I could cook if you desire."</p><p>Mercury gave a noncommittal  shrug.</p><p>"At least the wine cellar  is well stocked," Orion weakly offered.</p><p>"And how are your skills  as a sommelier?" Mercury asked.</p><p>"A what?" Orion  delicately asked.</p><p>Mercury contained her  disappointment. "You should have been able to figure that out via  context."</p><p>"I'm sorry  Mistress," Orion tried to kneel down but found herself being held up. She looked  to see Mercury's cold features gently thaw.</p><p>"Thank you," Orion  said as she fell onto Mercury's cold, but loving, embrace.</p><p>Mercury pulled Orion back to  her feet, and kissed her. "I am eternally thankful for the changes you  brought within me. Never forget that."</p><p>"I won't," Orion  said with a secret smile.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"Hello, my name's Nabiki  Saotome," the girl dressed in her Saint Helena uniform introduced herself  to her new classmates.</p><p>"Maybe you could tell us  more about yourself?" Miss Agnew asked the eager and young student.</p><p>"I'm the youngest of five  sisters." Nabiki paused and wondered how exactly to play this. Glancing at  the bored students before her, she made her decision. "My favorite color's  pink. I'm studying my family history now. Many mark my mother as a monster.  Mainly malevolent misfits that must meet their maker."</p><p>"Clever wordplay,"  Miss Agnew pleasantly offered. Her new student's transcripts indicated a very  bright and driven student.</p><p>Nabiki smiled. Fun was  definitely the better way to go. "Thank you. I think I'll find this  experience informative."</p><p>"Uh, that's very  nice." Miss Agnew hesitated. She was reminded by "Village of the  Damned" Those children were pale and gifted too. She pointed an empty seat  for Nabiki to take.</p><p>The powder-blue-haired girl  sat down and opened her backpack. She closed her eyes and briefly smiled at the  bare connection. Mother was trying her best and actually managed to connect to  her. Nabiki's thoughts on how long her mom could keep it up were interrupted  however.</p><p>"Wow, you're pretty  dolled up," A girl with her hair in a ponytail to the side remarked.</p><p>Nabiki looked over her thin,  frameless, and nonfunctional reading glasses. The girl would be pretty, if not  for the overdone eyeliner. "I like pink and am cute. What's your  excuse?"</p><p>"<i>Your</i> makeup makes  you look fourteen," the girl shot back.</p><p>"I am," Nabiki then  gave an adorable smile. "And I suppose you're really the malodorous corpse  of a prostitute that serviced circus folk."</p><p>The overly made-up girl's face  reddened in anger and she prepared a retort, but there was something about the  innocent face that was... upsetting.</p><p>Nabiki smirked inwardly and  turned her attention to the teacher. Maybe this could be fun.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"You guys like being back  in school?" Naoko asked Sunshine and her... friends</p><p>"Things feel a bit more  normal," Nariko admitted as she picked at her lunch.</p><p>"I can see that,"  Sam stated. Their table had suddenly gotten much fuller. She turned to the new  addition to the group. She was apparently another cousin or something to  Sunshine. Though she was awfully familiar with Sunny's other cousin Ukyou.  "What do you think Misako?"</p><p>"The uniforms aren't bad,  I guess." Misako frowned. At least they were not jumpers.</p><p>"I still think we should  all wear ones like... Sunny's old uniform," Akane grumbled.</p><p>"I don't know about  that," Ranma shrugged.</p><p>"There's enough of us now  to make a good set."</p><p>"You know that old  uniform of mine still has a skirt," Ranma reminded.</p><p>"Better than this one,"  Akane said fingering the hem of hers.</p><p>Naoko looked over to the table  that Sunshine's other acquaintances sat at. The decreased number was not  unexpected. She and Sam did learn about the falling out yesterday, but it did  remind her. "Huh, so anyone know what happen to Ami and Janet? They're not  in school today."</p><p>"Nope." Ranma then  went back to her food. She concentrated to sense Nabiki. Despite the distance  the connection remained strong.</p><p>"Must be related to their  fight with Usagi," Sam guessed.</p><p>"Yeah, probably  that."</p><p>"So uniforms then?"  Misako asked.</p><p>"We could vote on  it," Nariko offered.</p><p>"What about you  guys?" Ukyou asked Naoko and Sam. "You want darker uniforms with  fishnets? I'm sure we can make something in your size."</p><p>Naoko blushed while Sam was  contemplative.</p><p>Ranma looked at the others.  "I don't even think we need a vote. I mean do any of you want the normal  uniform?"</p><p>Naoko sipped her juice.  "Well, maybe not every day."</p><p>"Oh that's not part of  the fun," Sam pouted.</p><p>"I er... I guess,"  Naoko pulled back from the others slightly. "So any idea on us going  out?"</p><p>"There's the Red Turtle;  they'll have some live music on Wednesday," Ranma offered.</p><p>"You've been there?"  Sam asked.</p><p>"What's it like?"  Naoko inquired.</p><p>"Nice, mellow. I've never  been there when they have music, but if it's bad we can do something  else." Ranma went back to her lunch.</p><p>"And don't worry about  the age thing," Ukyou added.</p><p>"Especially if you wear  anything Sunny helped you buy," Nariko reminded.</p><p>"That reminds me,"  Ranma pushed around some of her lunch. "Someone else will be coming with  us."</p><p>"Another cousin of  yours?" Sam asked.</p><p>"Uh yeah," Ranma  coughed.</p><p>"You'll like  Yuki-chan," Misako assured.</p><p>"I'm sure she'll be  great; she's a part of your family," Sam said as she looked at each of the  pale girls in turn.</p><p>"Thanks," Ranma said  blushing with pride.</p><p>Naoko nodded in agreement. She  vaguely wondered why this new friend of Ranma's was not in school, but she let  it slide. There were plenty of reasons: Yuki doesn't live around here, she goes  to a different school, or the like. Regardless, she trusted Sunshine.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Nabiki frowned as she walked  down the hall. This was not fun. "Yes, I am developed," she said to a  boy. "You know, if you want to be lewd you might as well give a good shot  at it."</p><p>"What?" the  short-haired boy asked. "You're just a big bimbo."</p><p>Nabiki sighed. "You  impotent little moron. That doesn't make any sense. I'm clearly smarter than  all of you and I'm not big; I'm short."</p><p>"Girly little brain,"  he sniffed and walked off.</p><p>"That's actually better,  though not an insult," Nabiki yelled to his retreating back. She growled  and resumed walking down the hallway.</p><p>"Are you alright?"  Miss Agnew asked after approaching the pale girl. She felt apprehensive, but it  was part of the job.</p><p>Nabiki looked up to the  teacher. "Yes."</p><p>"Are you sure? I've seen  your performance today."</p><p>"Performance?"  Nabiki idly played with the pair of the bows in her hair.</p><p>Miss Agnew felt that something  was amiss. She remained silent as her student moved from her hair to checking  her too cute makeup.</p><p>"Yes, your performance.  You're a brilliant student, but you're not good at making friends." Miss  Agnew explained.</p><p>Nabiki put away her compact.  "I'm not that interested in making friends with children like this."</p><p>"Aren't you younger than  the other students?"</p><p>"Disappointing isn't  it," Nabiki sighed.</p><p>Miss Agnew shivered slightly.  "Yes, that is bad, but the class work will get better."</p><p>"I doubt it." Nabiki  then noticed the hurt on her teacher's face. "You're a fine teacher,  but..." She shrugged.</p><p>"You've been advanced a  year already," Miss Agnew cautioned. "Maybe you need to grow your  social skills some, keep a bit of pace with your academic ones."</p><p>"That would make the  fools around me even more insufferable," Nabiki replied.</p><p>Miss Agnew frowned. "Are  you sure? That's awfully cynical of an attitude. You sound almost like a  teacher."</p><p>Nabiki laughed. She was sure <i>Yuki</i> would have been happy here. Accommodatingly  cute was a great way to make friends, but Mother had to be supportive and  nurture her dreams. "I guess we just have to make the most of our  situation."</p><p>"So you'll try to be less  brash with your classmates?" Miss Agnew asked as they neared the front  doors.</p><p>"Not exactly," Nabiki  opened the doors and noticed her ride.</p><p>Miss Agnew frowned at the pair  of people leaning on an idling van that Nabiki ran to. The male one was  casually nondescript. He had short black hair and wore clothes that made him  look like any white collar drone. The dark sunglasses and stance added a bit  too much "forced coolness" for Agnew's tastes.</p><p>The other person waiting was  something else. She looked like a biker babe that had settled down enough to  have kids and a permanent address. The woman's sinfully teased crimson tresses  induced pangs of envy in the teacher. The way the leather pants, coat, and silk  blouse hung from the woman's body caused another pang.</p><p>Agnew then watched the redhead  happily scoop up Nabiki and pull the younger girl off her feet. After the warm  embrace, Nabiki and her mother, it had to be a mother, went into the van. The  relation was obvious, both had the same complexion, and Agnew could see where  Nabiki got her assets from.</p><p>The nondescript man lingered  just long enough to give Miss Agnew a funny salute with his thumb and pointer  finger connected, held over his eye, and then tipped foreword and out.</p><p>It was only after he had  slipped into the front passenger seat of the van and it had driven off that  Agnew realized something. The redhead who had easily lifted Nabiki off her feet  was almost the exact same height as her daughter.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"So you're not so sure  about that school?" Ranma asked her daughter. She and Nabiki were at the  kitchen table. On the ride home, Nabiki had explained her day.</p><p>"Well maybe," Nabiki  looked down at her Saint Helena uniform. "I don't know if high school  would be that much better."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Well, I'm not sure  things will be better if I'm a freshmen. Then the ages will be even more  apparent, but they will be older."</p><p>"And high schoolers are  supposed to be tragically jaded and sarcastic," Ranma sweetly reminded.</p><p>"Thanks Mom," Nabiki  laughed. "It was a bit of a shock, I didn't think it would be so..."  She shook her head. "I'm just too damn cute."</p><p>Misako had entered the room  and poured herself some juice. "Sure you don't want to go to high school  just because the stock's a bit more mature?"</p><p>Ranma turned to Misako.  "What did I say about draining horny teenage boys?"</p><p>"That it's way too easy  and none of those pathetic meat-bags are worthy to touch the glorious flesh of  someone from this family?"</p><p>"Close enough.  Interesting choice of words too." She said with deliberate delicateness.</p><p>Misako stood very still.  "Yes, Mother." She said slowly as she replaced the juice bottle.</p><p>Nabiki saw her sister falter  and stepped in. "It's not like she's calling all humans meat-bags. Just  those ones at school."</p><p>Misako coughed. "Yes, the  humans we work with are great people." She stepped from her mother.</p><p>"Yes, they are,"  Ranma continued, seemingly ignoring her daughter's fear. "But those boys  at school, they're just teenagers. It's their nature."</p><p>"Yes, you're right."  Misako said before quickly leaving the room.</p><p>"That was mean,"  Nabiki quietly and told her mother.</p><p>"Was it?" Ranma  shrugged. "So you'll be changing the type of fools you have to deal  with." She shook her head. There was a slight buzzing in the back of her  head. It faded and she dismissed it.</p><p>"But I'll be with my big  sisters, and you."</p><p>"I know." Ranma knew  that it would be more secure too. Nabiki would not be alone. The surveillance  teams would also be consolidated. "It's your choice." She frowned the  sensation had returned.</p><p>Nabiki looked down. "I  think I'll know by tomorrow. I mean, I kind of want to fit in more, and what if  moving doesn't help?"</p><p>"That sounds fine,  Honey," Ranma reassured as her phone started to ring.</p><p>Ranma answered and was  rewarded by a concerned voice. "Ma'am?"</p><p>"Yes, Maya?" Ranma  asked, recognizing the voice.</p><p>"We just detected a warm  body in the dojo. Are you doing any teleport training?" Agent Maya Iverson  asked.</p><p>"No," Ranma said her  voice growing cold. Akane and Ukyou were going to train in a few minutes but  there was nothing now. "Any pattern?"</p><p>"No, nothing. Maybe  human."</p><p>Ranma stood up. "Nabiki  bring the others down. It looks like we have another trespasser." She then  put her head back to the phone. "Maya any idea how this happened?"  Ranma asked as she unfolded her senses.</p><p>"There was some  electrical interference. We're getting more information," Maya apologized.  "Do you want support?"</p><p>"Have them on  standby," Ranma focused on the dojo and picked out its occupant. It was  human, but... She was reminded of the Senshi or Assemblymen. Both were modified  human, but this person was... different, and he was staying in the same spot.</p><p>Ranma shrugged and casually  walked over to the dojo. She slid the door open and prepared herself. What she  found was a diminutive old man standing in front of the shrine. His hands were  clasped behind his back and he looked like he was in an art gallery.</p><p>"You wouldn't happen to  be a relative of mine?" Ranma asked in jest as shadows started to build  and pool around her.</p><p>"I was really worried. I  was afraid my lousy students would be lousy teachers, but here's their dojo and  it's full of such... fascinating smells. You girls have been very busy in  here." The man slowly turned to face her. He froze with an amazed look.</p><p>"You taught my father?  Soun too? Oh dear," Ranma sighed. Even if this coot were telling the truth  things could be a pain.</p><p>"I see Nodoka's  influence," the old man noted, appraisingly.</p><p>"And the horns?"  Ranma asked walking over to him. "You have no idea how dumb you've  been."</p><p>"Oh?" He looked the  woman over. "Well you only live once," he blurred and pounced at  Ranma. He made contact with the demoness and just before he could get a grope  in felt a hand slide between him and her chest. There was a flash of pain and  he released and bounded away.</p><p>His robe had a series of  horizontal slashes that had blood oozing through in a few spots. "Still  worth it."</p><p>Ranma blinked. "You...  you tried to drain me? What?"</p><p>"I like pretty  ladies," the old man shrugged.<p>"Succubae drain human  males, not the other way around," Ranma lectured watching him carefully.</p><p>"You're not going to keep  an old man from having his fun." He then sobbed.</p><p>"Fun?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"You want us to bring in  the old guys?" Ukyou shouted from the back door to the house.</p><p>"Uh, sure," Ranma  said rubbing her chest with one hand.</p><p>"Oh good, so they are  home," the old man laughed. He then watched as five smirking women in a  box formation led his two students into the dojo. He felt that he had died and  gone to... well someplace that had very nice women who were no doubt amenable  to an old man's simple wishes.</p><p>"Explain," Ranma  ordered pointing to the old man.</p><p>"You're looking well,  Master," Genma said as he used a move Ranma immediately recognized: The  Crouch of the Wild Tiger.</p><p>"Yes, it's good to see  you Master Happosai," Soun said, entering a similarly submissive position.</p><p>"So, he really is your  teacher?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"He is the founder and  grandmaster of our school," Genma said.</p><p>"At least the new  generation seems better," Happosai noted.</p><p>"Was he always... into  breasts?" Ranma asked</p><p>"The Master is a virile  man and enjoys the pleasures of the flesh," Soun said, hedging his words.</p><p>"Meaning?" Ranma  asked impatiently as she looked at her father's teacher.</p><p>"He likes to grope women  and take their underwear. He had an impressive collection," Genma admitted.</p><p>"That's no doubt  moth-ridden, thanks to you," Happosai grumbled.</p><p>"So, he's a grizzled  martial arts master, that likes a quick fondle and a souvenir?"</p><p>"Don't you try to ruin my  fun."</p><p>"Uh, I've got a grandma  who invaded Earth with a demonic army. If you get your kicks by having some  hardly even dirty fun. I ain't gonna care."</p><p>"Oh you've made me so  happy!" Happosai beamed.</p><p>"Course if you touch my  kids, there won't even be any bones left." Ranma smiled warmly.</p><p>"Kids?" Happosai  asked.</p><p>"Yes, they're mine.  What's it too you?"</p><p>The old man pulled out a pipe.  "That explains the scents and ki in here. It's all related and so very  strong."</p><p>"So what? You just  dropping in?"</p><p>"Well, I had to escape  that little cave-in that those two -" the old man pointed to Genma and  Soun. "- setup. It took a few years, but I managed."</p><p>Ranma smirked. "You  actually tried to kill your master, Pops?" She laughed. "Figures you  wouldn't make sure the body was good and dead."</p><p>"Pitiful isn't it?"  Happosai agreed. "They got me drunk enough to pass out. They could have  ended me then, but they didn't have the stone to do it themselves."</p><p>"So they just left you to  die in a cave," Misako surmised.</p><p>Happosai looked forlornly at  the green-eyed demonesses. "You sure they're your kids?"</p><p>"Yes, their age from  birth is... I mean I turned them, well turned them to my brood." Ranma  coughed. "They're mine."</p><p>Happosai waved it off. "I  know about succubae. It's only natural given my hobby." He grinned  lecherously. "I remember that Genma had a son for one."</p><p>"Yeah, well things  changed."</p><p>"And now you're a sexy  succubus."</p><p>"This must be some kinda  dream for you right?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Happosai paused. "Well,  you don't mind the bras. You're not weak like your father. Killer body that's  oh so snuggly. Kids that at least seem competent. It's getting there."</p><p>He then walked over to the  corner of the dojo and tugged at a large sack. After nearly minute of rummaging  he then bounded to Ranma. "Here," he said handing a violet object  over.</p><p>The redhead held the bra up.  It was silk and was a bit overwrought in its lace detailing. "Not bad,  it's the right size. Good eye on that."</p><p>Happosai looked contemplative.  "So you're a demon, and you do martial arts."</p><p>"Yeah, had to modify the  school." Ranma said with pride. "New balance, extra limbs, flying,  and that stuff."</p><p>"I'd like to see that. So  are you going to try it on?" Happosai asked leeringly.</p><p>Ranma shrugged and slipped out  of her shirt and pulled off her bra. She smirked at the old man's reaction and  quickly pulled on the new one. "Geeze, they're just boobs. Chill  out."</p><p>"Oh you've made an old  man so very happy," he sobbed. Noticing Ranma's old bra, Happosai ran up  to it. "Such silky bliss," he said, rubbing the undergarment to his  face.</p><p>"Wow, you really are a  dirty old man," Ranma said fascinated and amused. The draining was  interesting; it was like he <i>learned</i> some demonic biology. She then  smirked when the summoned clothing started to disintegrate.</p><p>"No!" Happosai cried  as the bra started to dissolve. He tried to hold onto it, but the garment  decayed, eventually becoming insubstantial wisps. "Why did you do  that?" he asked pitifully.</p><p>"It's just how things  work." Clothing summoned by a succubus tended to fade when separated from  its creator. Though the rate of decay can be controlled.</p><p>"Does it happen with all  your clothes?"</p><p>Ranma smiled evilly.</p><p>"Oh that just  sucks," Happosai pouted. "I hope your girls aren't as plainly dressed  as you."</p><p>Misako smiled. "Finally,  someone who agrees with me."</p><p>"I'm not that fond of  frilly stuff," Ranma said crossing her arms over he chest.</p><p>"Yes, you're more of a  sexy functional," Happosai said appraisingly. "So what's are these  modified moves like?"</p><p>"That a challenge?"  Ranma asked, shifting into her violet Lycra unitard.</p><p>"Oh I like spunk,"  Happosai smirked.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>The first thing Major Saotome  noticed was the jagged hole in the dojo's roof. It was above the front entrance  and quite large. Nodoka then caught a glimpse of the sparring. The thermal  visuals from base did not do it justice.</p><p>She silently watched as two  figures danced around each other. Fast, predatory grace defined her daughter's  powerful moves, but her diminutive opponent was even nimbler. The small figure  was even more difficult to track. Nodoka also noticed four of her  granddaughters were also watching.</p><p>He noticed Nodoka's presence  and bounded over to her. "Hi No-chan. Long time no see."</p><p>Ranma used the opportunity and  tried to grapple him to the ground, but he wormed out of her grip.</p><p>"Attacking while my back  was turned," Happosai shook his head.</p><p>Ranma smirked, and wiped her  brow.</p><p>"Nice touch that."  Happosai turned back to Nodoka. "You've got a good kid. Spirited, but  she's not too respectful of her elders."</p><p>"Groping old goat,"  Ranma grumbled as she caught her breath. "You still kept goin' after my  boobs."</p><p>"You were free to stop  me," Happosai smirked.</p><p>"I see you haven't  changed much," Nodoka remarked.</p><p>Happosai smiled broadly.  "So what's with the soldier getup? You with these other guys?"</p><p>"Yes, I wanted to find my  daughter and they offered to help," Nodoka explained. There was also the  pride of her work, knowing how it helped agents, but there was no need to tell  him that.</p><p>"Ranma was a girl that  long ago?"</p><p>"Nope." Ranma  adjusted her unitard.</p><p>"So Genma did take you on  that training trip," Happosai remarked. He looked the sweaty succubus  over. "Didn't do to badly with that at least."</p><p>Ranma beamed. "You're not  to shabby yourself. Been a long time since I sparred like that."</p><p>"You were holding back,  though," Happosai remarked.</p><p>"Yeah, I didn't use my  claws, tail spines, or fireballs. Would be a shame to shorten the fun,"  Ranma smiled toothily.</p><p>"Fun? You call me hitting  you mercilessly as you lumbered around fun?"</p><p>"Feh, it wasn't that  bad."</p><p>"You were sent flying  through the roof," Happosai remarked.</p><p>"So? I came right  back."</p><p>Happosai nodded. "It is  handy having a student that won't get worn down, not like that pair of  idiots."</p><p>"I have tea," Nariko  said as she walked up to the dojo carrying a tray.</p><p>"Ranma's a very serious  student," Nodoka said.</p><p>"Yes it shows. She's a  lot like you," Happosai blurred and then latched onto her chest. "Oh  I've missed this, such-" He was cut off as a pair of red beams hit his  body and knocked him off.</p><p>"I know you're happy to  see grandma, but it's impolite to be grabby," Nariko gently chastised as  she put down the tea set. She idly rubbed her eyes.</p><p>"Thank you  Nari-chan," Nodoka complimented.</p><p>"That's great,  Honey," Ranma said hugging her daughter. "How long have you been able  to do this?"</p><p>Nariko blushed. "Just  now. I wanted to stop him from touching Grandma."</p><p>Happosai shook his head and  pulled himself back to his feet. "Ouch... why didn't you use that on  me?" he asked Ranma as he patted the burn marks on his clothes.</p><p>"Because my eyebeams  would burn right through you," Ranma smiled at Nariko. "We'll have to  strengthen up your own beams, Honey."</p><p>"Fine, ruin all my  fun," Happosai pouted.</p><p>Ranma rolled her eyes.  "Oh please we're not a bunch of prudes."</p><p>"I wouldn't want to be  touched by a wrinkled old man," Akane commented.</p><p>Ranma tilted her head.  "You know Happi, I think Akane volunteered for the next sparring  match."</p><p>Happosai smirked. "I like  the way you think, Red."</p><p>"Training shouldn't be a  cakewalk. So you decided to track Genma down? What'd you do, find out where  Drake was living?"</p><p>"Not exactly,"  Happosai said as he sized up Akane.</p><p>"Mom?" Akane asked.</p><p>"You'll be fine,"  Ranma waved a hand. "So how did you find us?"</p><p>"It was weird. I was  enjoying the generous donations of some very lovely ladies when a gaijin priest  sat down next to me." Happosai smiled fondly.</p><p>"Priest?" Nodoka  asked.</p><p>Ranma coughed.</p><p>"We got to talking and it  turns out he was a friend of The Drake. Crazy third wheel to my idiot  students."</p><p>"And of course he knew  where to find the Drake," Ranma sighed. How predictable.</p><p>"And where Soun lived  too, funny guy. Was really loose for a priest." Happosai shrugged.</p><p>"Pardon?" Nodoka  then exchanged a glance with Ranma.</p><p>"Describe him,"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Average enough guy. Grey  eyes I guess. Fidgeted a bit. You know, just a guy." Happosai paused.</p><p>"Nothing more  specific?"</p><p>"I don't pay attention to  guys. Not my thing," Happosai shrugged.</p><p>"He give a name?"  Ranma asked guessing who it was.</p><p>"Minister Prembrose."</p><p>"First name Murdock by  any chance?"</p><p>"He didn't give it, but  maybe."</p><p>"We have some pictures of  Murdock you can look at," Nodoka offered.</p><p>"It's probably him,"  Ranma sighed. "So why would he do that?"</p><p>Happosai gave a measured look.  "He wanted me here. That's obvious. So you know this guy? What's his  deal?"</p><p>"He's just some mook that  likes causin' trouble," Ranma explained.</p><p>"We believe, he is trying  to orchestrate events," Nodoka said.</p><p>"Take over the world,  dark conspiracies, back room dealings," Ranma's tone was disdainful and  bored.</p><p>"Aren't you a demon  that's working with some sort of secret military thing?" Happosai asked.</p><p>"I've got a good thing  with them."</p><p>"Now who to train,"  Happosai pondered. "My lousy students or your kids?"</p><p>"You never did properly  greet them," Ranma smirked.</p><p>"And they haven't left  yet," Nodoka helpfully added. "They're still in the den  drinking."</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"I can't believe there  wasn't anything in Ami's room," Makoto said as she looked at the cold  beverages.</p><p>"What, you expect her to  have an 'I heart Mistress Lyra' poster in her room?" Rei asked as she  looked around the convenience store. She saw the two blondes over by the frozen  foods aisle looking morose.</p><p>"There could have been  some notes or plans," Makoto defended.</p><p>"Why? She kept everything  on her computer," Rei pulled a bottle of pop out. "I'm disappointed  that Janet's mom didn't have any info."</p><p>"What? Setsuna talked to  her. Doctor Fraiser thinks her daughter is at space camp or something out in  Colorado," Makoto frowned.</p><p>"Clearly, they got to  her, messed with her mind," Rei scowled.</p><p>"Had to have. Janet  couldn't have been around for what, couple of years?"</p><p>"But Doc Fraiser thought  she adopted Janet a long time ago," Rei smirked. "We still have to  watch her. Janet's mom is either a patsy or another minion."</p><p>"That's not a nice thing  to say about my mom," Orion lazily remarked as she entered from the back  hallway that led to the bathrooms. She held her double-bladed staff with one  end resting on her shoulder.</p><p>"Traitor!" Rei  shouted as she immediately transformed.</p><p>Makoto turned to the front and  was dismayed and unsurprised to see Virgo and Mercury walk in through the front  door.</p><p>"Don't give me a reason  to punish you again," Mercury icily said to Virgo. The former Amazon  angrily nodded and turned towards the blondes.</p><p>"What's this a costume  contest?" the half-stoned clerk asked. The flashy lights were a shock.</p><p>"Something like  that," Mercury smirked as she stood in front of him.</p><p>He smiled vaguely. "You're  sure to win dressed like that."</p><p>"Thank you," Mercury  said and snapped her fingers in front of his face.</p><p>"Huh?," the clerk  mumbled as he collapsed to the ground.</p><p>"You monster!" Rei  accused.</p><p>Mercury sighed and turned to  the Senshi. "Only one of you had the sense to transform?"</p><p>"So this is Virgo?"  Minako asked. She looked between Virgo's ample chest and Mercury's corseted  bosom contemplatively.</p><p>Mercury raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"I'm going to save  you," Usagi's face as stern and she grabbed for her broach.</p><p>"Let's see," Mercury  smirked as she sauntered over to the blondes.</p><p>There was a pair of flashes  and Venus stepped in between Mercury and her Princess. Mercury smiled thinly as  she rapped a folded tessen against Venus' head. The blonde dodged but was then  attacked by Virgo.</p><p>"Should have summoned  your sword," Mercury laughed</p><p>"No!" Jupiter  shouted as tried to jump over to Moon.</p><p>Orion slipped her staff  between Jupiter's legs and then twisted it. The brunette tumbled to the ground  and her left leg was sliced when Orion pulled her staff out.</p><p>"Don't kill her,"  Mercury ordered Virgo. "I have plans for Venus."</p><p>"Yes Mistress,"  Virgo sighed.</p><p>"You can stop this,"  Mercury stepped closer to her princess.</p><p>Moon narrowed her eyes.  "Starlight Honeymoon Therapy Kiss." The brilliant flash bloomed  enveloped Mercury and then died down.</p><p>"Tingly," Mercury  laughed and adjusted her corset. "I'm not some phage, but it's good to see  you had the stone to at least try."</p><p>"You save the princess,  I'll take care of Naru," Jupiter said as she stood back up. The bleeding  from her cut had slowed down.</p><p>Mars nodded and took aim.  "Mars Flame Sniper!" She then ran down the aisle.</p><p>Mercury twisted and flipped  open a fan and intercepted the burning arrow. The other tessen she pointed  towards the floor at the head of the aisle.</p><p>Mars ignored that her attack  missed and put her heel down... and lost her footing. The patch of ice was thin  but large enough. Slamming into the counter at the front of the store Mars  groaned in pain.</p><p>"Girls who wear high  heels to a fight should watch where they walk," Mercury sermonized. She  turned to see Virgo dodging around Venus' chain.</p><p>"Quit playing with her,  and just knock her out." Mercury ordered.</p><p>Virgo nodded and caught the  end of the Love Me chain with one sword and then used the flat of the other to  knock out Venus's left foot. Pulling the chain, Virgo toppled the unbalanced  Senshi and proceeded to chain her up.</p><p>"This is all a game to  you, you sick bitch," Mars growled as she stood back up, careful to avoid  the ice patch.</p><p>"No, this is deadly  serious to me." For the first time Mercury sounded genuinely insulted.</p><p>Mars snarled and tried to  shoot another arrow. Blocking with her tessen, Mercury closed in. She flipped  her fans over and launched a barrage of icicles at Mars. The black-haired  Senshi shrieked as thin icicles punctured her arms.</p><p>"Rei!" Jupiter and  Moon cried. Jupiter then yelped when Orion trusted forward with her staff.</p><p>Orion's smirk died when  Jupiter fired a blast at her. Orion dodged on the inside and spun the staff  around and hit Jupiter on the head just under the blades. She leaned over  Jupiter with a slight smirk. "Learn to fight in close."</p><p>Jupiter's left hand shot up  and grabbed Orion's neck while her right held the staff away. "Same for you,"  she said as she squeezed Orion's neck.</p><p>Orion struggled and pulled her  neck out of the grip, but Jupiter responded by holding her staff with two  hands. Orion kept her face neutral as the two struggled over the long, bladed  weapon.</p><p>Jupiter leveraged the staff  over the shorter girl and pressed her against the wall. Orion growled and tried  to kick the brunette but Jupiter easily evaded. "Forgot that I'm actually  a martial artist."</p><p>"Oh I didn't," Orion  smirked. "I was just stalling."</p><p>Jupiter frowned and then  twisted away and jumped when Virgo charged her with a pair of swords.</p><p>"Damn your goons,"  Mars said as she pulled some of the icicles out of her arms.</p><p>"At least mine can act  like a team," Mercury smirked as she iced the ground under Mars' feet.</p><p>Mars jumped up and landed on  the counter. "Nice try." The weakened surface creaked and broke apart  in a cloud of ice and frost. Mars fell into a heap with the passed out clerk.</p><p>"I thought so,"  Mercury smirked. It was satisfying to see a plan come together.</p><p>Mars swore and clawed her way  over the broken counter. She landed on the iced tile carefully and took a step  forward, or tried to. She looked down to see the ice creeping over her heels.  Swearing again she slipped out of her shoes and landed on some clear tile.</p><p>Mercury frowned at the bare  feet. "Why didn't you just flash your power? You control fire."</p><p>Rage contorting her face, Mars  glared. Flames sprung up around her gloves and she charged forward.</p><p>"Excellent," Mercury  said as she blocked the flaming fists with her tessen. Behind her smirk she  wondered. The fans would hold up; they were designed to take much more than  this.</p><p>"Damn you!" Mars  punched down and connected with Mercury's ice skirt, shattering some of the  frozen pleats. Mars could have sworn she saw fear in the traitor's eyes, but it  was quickly replaced by bored disdain.</p><p>"Dirty," Mercury  noted, inwardly relieved that the armor of her skirt absorbed the blow.  "Feels good doesn't it?" she smarmily asked. Getting Mars mad was  easy, and it negated her advantages. Rei's attacks were accurate and quick, at  range. Close quarters was another issue.</p><p>"Shut up," Rei  hissed, as she blindly dove forward.</p><p>Unsummoning her tessen,  Mercury reached out and grabbed Mars' hands and for a few seconds ice and fire  battled. Steam started to billow through the room. The ice crystal on Mercury's  tiara flared, and the steam died down, as did the flames. Mars tried to pull  out when the crystalline water started to creep up her arms.</p><p>Mars' eyes and arms flared and  the ice shattered. "I won't go down that easily."</p><p>"Good," Mercury  smirked unpleasantly. Inwardly her mind raced, Rei was putting up more of a  fight than she predicted. Her smirk grew into an evil grin as she recalled  Virgo's lessons.</p><p>Mars grinned as the flames  strengthened, she then nearly stumbled as Mercury suddenly pulled her in  closer. Mars' confusion was short lived as Mercury suddenly rammed her knee  into Mar's chin.</p><p>Mars fell to the ground in a  groaning heap. Still laughing, Mercury looked down at her broken skirt.  "Easily enough fixed," she said as her skirt grew back to its full  size. She also stepped back discretely.</p><p>"You bitch," Mars  swore as she pulled herself back up and her flames sprung back.</p><p>Mercury smiled as she recalled  her tessen. She spread the fans and flicked two arcs of icicles at Mars.  "It's just a few puncture wounds," Mercury remarked to the fallen  Mars.</p><p>Mars got up, and felt the  shards of ice start to melt. Several large splashes of watery blood fell to the  ground. After shouting out, she clasped her hands and a lance of fire burst  out.</p><p>Mercury twisted her tessen in  front of her; the sheets of ice composing them expanding to shield her from the  blast. Immediately after it died down she lunged forward.</p><p>Mars was knocked full to the  ground and found the edge of a spread fan pushed to her neck. Mars gasped and  tried to rip the tessen away.</p><p>"Naughty Rei,"  Mercury mocked as she used the other tessen as a bludgeon. She shook some blood  off the end of the fan. "Least your thick head was good enough for  something."</p><p>"What did you do?"  Moon demanded as she marched forward.</p><p>Mercury looked down at the  unconscious woman. "Don't worry, it's not that bad. I know what I'm  doing." She smiled coldly.</p><p>Moon looked around. Minako was  tied up. Rei was knocked out and Makoto was down with multiple sharp implements  pressing into her chest and neck. "You think you've won?" she asked,  her voice depressed and angered.</p><p>"I'd hardly call  defeating girls like this a victory." Mercury sighed.</p><p>"You haven't beaten me  yet," Moon stepped forward.</p><p>Mercury laughed. "That's  not how it works. No, the villain takes out all the princess's guards and then  when it's darkest she wins." She leaned in close and whispered. "And  I'm sorry Princess, but this isn't even close to darkest."</p><p>Moon pulled back and gasped.  "You are a monster."</p><p>"Monster?" Mercury  smiled widely. "Do you want that? It'll speed things up. One word and  Orion and Virgo will plunge their blades into Makoto."</p><p>"No..."</p><p>"And don't think you  could bring her back. You couldn't bring Mamoru back. You couldn't bring the  woman and child the Will killed. You won't bring Makoto back."</p><p>"What's wrong with you!  You have to fight this! This isn't you!" Usagi pleaded.</p><p>"You're right. That isn't  me." Mercury paced over to Mars. "I could kill her too. Be so easy,  too easy."</p><p>The corseted Senshi chuckled  and then walked to Venus. "Bondage does suit her," she said kneeling  down.</p><p>"Gonna threaten to kill  her too?" Moon asked.</p><p>"Oh no, I have plans for  Minako." Mercury laughed. "You've all forgotten her potential.  Shame."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"What?" Mercury  asked.</p><p>"No." Moon's eyes  focused on Mercury's. "You won't take her. This ends now."</p><p>Mercury clenched her teeth.</p><p>"I want my friend  back," Moon stated. "And I won't let you hurt them."</p><p>"Really now?"  Mercury's smirk was short lived as a kick caught the crouching girl in the  chin.</p><p>"Moon Kick!" Moon  shouted as Mercury flew back and crashed into a few shelves of bread.</p><p>Mercury shook he head and  looked at the vengeful blonde. "You hit me," she said wiping some  blood off her lips. "Wonderful."</p><p>"Even though I've ended  up fighting enemies alone, it's the love of my friends that keeps me  going," Moon said as she confidently strode forward.</p><p>"You don't have to be  alone," Mercury said as she stood up. Her eyes briefly darted around to  make sure that Virgo and Orion were covering Makoto and that Rei and Minako  were still out of action.</p><p>"Stop." Moon  ordered.</p><p>Mercury's eyes immediately  returned to the princess.</p><p>"You're going to stop  your madness. I'm your Princess and you will not defy me." Moon balled her  hands.</p><p>"That's how you're gonna  play it?" Mercury asked through her teeth.</p><p>Moon glared at the spilled  blood and hurt friends. "Yes. I'll do whatever it takes."</p><p>"Just like me,"  Mercury laughed. "So do you want me to leave?"</p><p>"You're not going to let  me try and purify you?" Usagi inquired.</p><p>"Like it'll work the  second time," Mercury rolled her eyes. "I've got things to do, Virgo,  grab Minako when we leave. Orion destroy the security tapes from the back  room."</p><p>"You're not taking  Minako." Moon's voice was forceful and her body hummed with power.</p><p>Mercury narrowed her eyes.  "Fine be that way." She wandered towards the back of the store.</p><p>While Orion covered, Virgo  forcefully rolled Makoto over and stepped back so Mercury could hogtie her with  ice. "Orion, I still want you to take care of those tapes now."</p><p>Orion nodded and broke into  the back room.</p><p>"I'm going to defeat  you," Moon promised as Mercury returned to the front of the store.</p><p>"Of course you  will." Mercury stepped over Mars, careful not to get any blood on her  heels. "I wouldn't expect any less from you."</p><p>"You're not a monster,  I'm gonna save you," Moon pulled her hands up and after saying the magic  words a beam of purifying magic flared out and hit Mercury square in the chest.</p><p>Mercury cleared her throat.  "Are you done?"</p><p>Moon's arms fell to her sides.  It was easier when Mercury was being violent, egotistical, and prideful. When  she showed pity, it was hard.</p><p>Mercury stepped in and hugged  the depressed Princess. "Don't worry, I'll make sure you have people  worthy of you." Her hand slipped just inside Moon's skirt and caressed the  area where thigh became butt.</p><p>"Huh?" Moon asked as  her body blushed at the physical contact.</p><p>"Come with me,"  Mercury whispered. "I promise you'll like it."</p><p>Moon's eye widened. She gasped  and tried to squirm away. "Let go of me," she asked her voice hardly  a whisper.</p><p>Mercury kept holding her.  "Are you sure?"</p><p>"Got the tapes,  Mistress," Orion said as she and Virgo came to the front of the store.</p><p>"Last chance."  Mercury offered as she largely succeeded at smiling warmly.</p><p>Despite her blush, Usagi  looked serious. "No."</p><p>Mercury ended the embrace.  "Maybe later then." She smirked at Venus' fearful expression.  "Let's go girls."</p><p>As the trio made their way to  the door, Moon took half a step forward. She hesitated and then stepped  backwards. The last she heard from Mercury was her thanking Virgo for her work.  The blonde then fell to the floor and with twitching fingers managed to call  Setsuna on her communicator.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"These are great  uniforms," Sam remarked as she adjusted the black blouse to her new  uniform. She smiled at her reflection.</p><p>"I think the fishnets may  be a bit much," Naoko said, looking at herself in the mirror.</p><p>Ranma left the stall and took  a sink next to her friends.</p><p>"Thanks for the uniforms,  Sunny," Sam complimented.</p><p>"Yeah, it's great that  you could make them so quick," Naoko added.</p><p>"It was nothing, the  others helped." Ranma looked up as she washed her hands. It did feel nice  to be back in this uniform.</p><p>"Did Nabiki help?"  Sam playfully asked.</p><p>Ranma blinked. After her  second day at Saint Helena Nabiki had made up her mind. The redhead smiled at  her friends. "Nabiki Saotome, Misako's little sister or Nabiki Tendo,  Akane's big sister?"</p><p>Naoko laughed. "I don't  see Nabiki Tendo ever helping sew some skirts."</p><p>"Now little Yuki-chan.  She'd do it." Sam evaluated.</p><p>"It's also great to see a  brainiac that's not some meek eager to please pushover."</p><p>"Definite improvement in  Nabikis," Naoko remarked. "She's half Tendo's size, and half the  smirking con artist."</p><p>"Though the pink is a bit  much," Sam considered.</p><p>"I think it works for  her. She is fourteen."</p><p>"You don't find her  odd?" Ranma asked. Nabiki had said no one would be able to connect Nabiki  Tendo with Nabiki Saotome. Ranma's suggestion that she go as Nabiki</p><p>"Oh she's strange, but so  what? Normal people are boring." Sam pulled out a compact and touched up  her makeup.</p><p>"Shame Tendo already left,  we never got to see how she would react to 'Yuki-chan'." Naoko smiled.  Misako's pet name for her little sister was cute. Though the circle that could  use it was even smaller than the people who could call Sunshine Sunny. So far  only Sunshine or Misako had called her Yuki, but it was only the first day.</p><p>Sam rolled her eyes.  "Like Tendo would care about some cute and smart girl with the same first  name as her. She didn't care about Nabiki Sato."</p><p>"What do you think  Sunny?" Naoko closed her compact.</p><p>"Of course I like Nabiki.  She's family."</p><p>"Yes you do dote over  your cousins." Naoko smiled.</p><p>"Heck, you dote over all  your friends." Sam put on some lipstick. "You're like a mom to all of  us."</p><p>Ranma blushed. "Thanks  guys."</p><p>"So you looking forward  to going out tonight?" Sam asked as they left the bathroom.</p><p>"Of course," Ranma  smiled.</p><p>"We should get back to  class," Naoko reminded.<p>"We've got time. It's  still lunch period." Sam smiled at the shocked looks at their uniforms.  That was still a blast.</p><p>"Wanna go back to the  table?" Naoko asked.</p><p>"Sure, eight girls  dressed like this at one table's bound to make quite the scene"</p><p>"Yes," Ranma stuck  her tongue out. "We found that out just a few minutes ago. People were  whispering all around us."</p><p>Sam smiled toothily.  "Well, let's give them an encore."</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"This is nice,"  Naoko said from a corner booth to the Red Turtle. She sipped her beer. She was  pleased to find that she was not the only one nursing their drink. At every  other party she went to the kids would drink themselves stupid.</p><p>"But what happened to the  music?" Sam asked.</p><p>"Ukyou's asking the  bartender," Ranma said as she looked at her beer. Part of her wanted a  Scotch but she did not want to tempt the others with hard liquor.</p><p>"Good dresses, you  two," Misako complimented.</p><p>"Thanks, Sunny picked  them out for us," Sam blushed. Leather did feel a bit odd but the black  dress did look good on her.</p><p>"Sunny has good fashion  sense," Nabiki smirked.</p><p>"And you look much  older," Naoko tried to compliment.</p><p>Nabiki sipped her pop.  "It's easy when you normally go for the cute and pink look."</p><p>"There's still pink trim  on that cheongsam," Sam pointed out.</p><p>"I think removing her  hair ribbons does more to make her look older," Akane remarked as she  snuggled onto Nariko.</p><p>"Yeah, she could even  pass for sixteen, maybe seventeen." Sam then looked down to her beer in  thought.</p><p>"Oh no, I'm not that  old," Nabiki blushed. "Sunny was the one to get me in."</p><p>"Yeah, she just talked to  those coworkers of Kasumi's," Naoko said.</p><p>"How's things going with  Kasumi?" Sam asked the girl she knew as Sunshine.</p><p>"Great," Ranma said  a bit dreamily. "She's very strong, decisive, and really good in  bed."</p><p>"Heh, of course you'd  think of that," Sam said. Under her gruff exterior, Sunshine really was a  soft and sensitive girl.</p><p>"So yeah there's no band  tonight," Ukyou sighed as she slid back into the booth. "The drummer  found out that the bass player was sleeping with his girlfriend, the lead  singer."</p><p>"Isn't tonight's band the  Discount Auto Parts?" Sam asked.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Well the bass player's a  girl too."</p><p>"So?" Misako asked.</p><p>Sam chuckled. "Right,  forgot that you're all lesbians."</p><p>"You don't know that I'm  one," Nabiki pouted.</p><p>"Well the rest your  family..." Naoko countered.</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "I guess  that's a requirement of wearing the special uniform."</p><p>Naoko looked to Sam and  blushed.</p><p>"So there's no  music?" Sam sighed.</p><p>"Sunny could sing,"  Nariko offered.</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened.  "Well, I'm not that good." She hesitated; it did move the subject  away from her family.</p><p>"Yes you are; you sing  all the time," Ukyou teased. "Ever since Auntie Saotome got you that  book and then those tapes."</p><p>"They've got a karaoke  machine." Misako added. "So it'll be easy."</p><p>"Yeah, do it Sunny!"  Akane added.</p><p>Ranma's face valiantly tried  to pale.</p><p>"You know you want  to," Misako smirked.</p><p>"I'm not gonna get out of  this?" Ranma looked to see that even the off-duty agents in the bar were,  subtly of course, watching.<p>As one the girls smirked.</p><p>"Fine," Ranma sighed  and motioned for the girls to let her out of the booth.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Inspector Rebus sat at his  desk. It was late but he had switched shifts with Rawlings. He looked up from  the papers and photographs to see his partner standing above him.</p><p>"Something wrong,  Rich?" Inspector Henderson asked. "Last night's case?"</p><p>"Yeah, It's that  convenience store... fight," Rebus shrugged.</p><p>"Damn strange. There was  ice and blood. We know at least two women had been hurt, but there wasn't  enough for a mortal injury."</p><p>"And the clerk said there  was a mess of girls in funny skirts and bows attacking some other girls.  'Course he was stoned out of his mind and passed out," Rebus grumbled as  he got up and walked to the coffee machine.</p><p>"The security tapes were  fried, but nothing was stolen." Henderson followed. "And some of the  items were burnt."</p><p>"Don't forget that dent  in the floor. Looks like something was bashed with a hammer. We're checking to  see if any women went missing yesterday, but I'm not holding my breath." Rebus  cringed at the poor quality coffee, at least it had caffeine.</p><p>"What? You think this is  related to those rumors of skirted vigilante-girls?"</p><p>Rebus laughed. "I thought  that stuff was misdirection. Maybe I still do." He sipped some more of the  awful, warm beverage. "But the police weren't the first ones on  scene."</p><p>"You mean those  consulting guys? They arrived with forensics." Despite his better judgment  Henderson poured himself a cup.</p><p>"Sure. Still it's odd  that an anti-terrorism consultant group helping our department's Emergency Task  Force would be at a nominally simple convenience store robbery."</p><p>"I thought Willard  International Consulting was helping the RMCP's Emergency Response Team."</p><p>"My mistake."  Inspector Rebus put down his mug. "You have to admit. Something's odd  about that fight. All that ice, passed out clerk, nonsense about girls in  corsets and ice, blood, fire damage, and nosey company."</p><p>"Things are getting  strange," Henderson agreed.</p><p>Rebus nodded. "We'll keep  at it. Someone had to have seen something, or someone will show up missing.  We've got blood samples to match."</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Setsuna opened the door to the  bar and immediately heard a seductive siren's call. Unconsciously smiling, she  entered. An agent by the door nodded as she walked past. It was then that  Setsuna caught full view of the singer.</p><p>From the tiny raised stage,  the leather-clad redhead gave a saucy wink to the visitor. Setsuna stared at  the singing succubus. "Wow, she can really hit the low notes."</p><p>"She's a natural,"  Maya Iverson remarked from the bar, next to Setsuna.</p><p>Setsuna raised an eyebrow at  the agent and turned back to the stage. The smile grew and she could almost  feel the sounds vibrating in her chest. For such a small woman, the redhead  really knew how to project her voice.</p><p>Ranma finished her song and  bowed to the applauding bar. She blushed at the calls for an encore, which did  not entirely come from the her friends' table. "I'll be back for another  song in a few minutes," she said into her microphone. She sauntered off  the table and went straight to Setsuna.</p><p>"You like what you  heard?" Ranma smiled suggestively.</p><p>"Should have known you'd  have been able to sing like that," Setsuna shook her head.</p><p>Ranma smirked. "So what  do you want? I wanna get back to my friends."</p><p>"Have you seen Ami or any  of her minions?" Setsuna asked after ordering a martini.</p><p>"Not since the day Ami  freaked out. I did hear about the convenience store thing." Ranma winced.  "They really got stomped. Mostly because of those 'minions' as you call  them."</p><p>"Yes, Mercury is good at  leveraging her resources and knowledge."</p><p>"Of course, Shampoo's  probably a better marital artist than all of you combined, tenacious too. Then  there's Janet, bright girl."</p><p>"Troubling," Setsuna  gulped down nearly half of her drink.</p><p>"That's an  understatement, from what Usagi told me they would switch off. Janet would do  the magical deflection while Shampoo would be the muscle."</p><p>Setsuna nodded.</p><p>"So are you digging for  info or just giving it away?" Ranma looked at her watch pointedly.</p><p>Setsuna glared and finished  off her drink. "Look, if Ami approaches you, don't help her. Call  us."</p><p>"Oh, you actually got a  plan for her?" Ranma asked, chuckling.</p><p>"Oddly enough, she was  obeying Usagi's orders at the end. Maybe we can use that." Setsuna then  ordered another drink.</p><p>"Yeah, Ami hasn't found a  way to work around that," Ranma shook her head. "Careful, Usagi  sounded pretty tempted by her offer."</p><p>Setsuna glared. "I have  hope for our Princess."</p><p>"She was the only one that  got a hit in." Ranma nodded. "But that's not enough, the other's  aren't enough either. At least you seem to know that."</p><p>"Yes." Setsuna  sipped her refilled glass. "In a way I'm glad Mercury did this to them.  Now they'll take it seriously."</p><p>Ranma blinked. "That's  blunt."</p><p>"We're beyond banal  pleasantries," Setsuna put her glass down and left her tip.</p><p>"Good luck I guess,"  Ranma looked to the stage again.</p><p>"Oh? You don't want Ami  to win?"</p><p>"Usagi'll make the right  choice." Ranma smirked. "Or not."</p><p>Setsuna shook her head and  walked out of the bar.</p><p>"That was your old  girlfriend, right? What was that about?" Sam asked after easing up next to  her friend.</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "She was  just asking me about Ami."</p><p>"She knows Ami too?  Strange."</p><p>"Nah, she's in charge of  the exchange group."</p><p>"Okay," Sam was  impressed that excuse might even be real, not that it mattered "So gonna  go back to your singing?"</p><p>Ranma looked at the expectant  friends and agents. "Yeah, I guess so." She then sauntered her way  back to the stage.</p><p>"So what do you think of  her ass?" Naoko asked when Sam returned to the booth.</p><p>"Shhh, Sunny's  started." Sam then smiled and watched her friend begin to sing. "And  it's quite nice, she's a lucky girl, Kasumi too."</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>During the walk through the  corridors, Kodachi steeled herself. She then exited the building and walked  across the grass to the range. She grumbled at the sight. It was somehow wrong,  for non-agents to get such latitude.</p><p>She knew the Company would  employ NH contractors but this seemed to be taking things too far. She caught  herself. Colonel Edwards and Commander Stillwater were overseeing this project.  They knew what they were doing.</p><p>"Yes, Cadet?" Major  Saotome asked when Kodachi got close enough. The officer then handed what had  to be a custom handgun to one of the broodlings.</p><p>"I just want to speak  with my sister, Ma'am." Kodachi automatically saluted and waited for  Nodoka to return.</p><p>"That's fine."  Nodoka saluted back and resumed talking with Ukyou.</p><p>Nariko walked to Kodachi.  "Yes, sister?"</p><p>Kodachi frowned at the  harshness in the last word. "I'm sorry about that. I shouldn't have been  like that with you."</p><p>"No you shouldn't," Nariko  replied flatly.</p><p>Kodachi shifted her feet.  "So, how's things with you?"</p><p>"Fine, Grandma's been  making some very interesting things," Nariko looked over her shoulder.</p><p>Kodachi was distracted by  seeing Misako fire what should be a crew-served weapon at her shoulder.</p><p>"Sister?" Nariko  coughed over the noise.</p><p>"Uh, yes, well I wanted  to tell you that I'm going back to my training."</p><p>"That should help make  you into a proper agent," Nariko wryly remarked.</p><p>Kodachi glared.</p><p>"Good then," Nariko  laughed.</p><p>"So that's it?"  Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Not quite," Nariko  smirked and pounced.</p><p>Kodachi stepped back but was  still caught in a strong hug.</p><p>"When you can stop  flinching like this, we'll be better," Nariko whispered into Kodachi's  ear.</p><p>Kodachi nodded and with  considerable concentration wrapped her arms around her sister. "You  haven't really changed. You're still the type of person to toss severed heads  at frightened people."</p><p>"This time they're not  just from fish," Nariko smirked. She had already apologized to Akane for  doing that, and it was really funny.</p><p>Kodachi sniffed and broke out  of the hug. "I suppose that's it."</p><p>Nariko rolled her eyes.  "Well, you're trying to be more pleasant."</p><p>Kodachi looked over to see  Captain Jarvis stride over to Ranma. The two conversed briefly.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"Really? So what are they  doing?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"We don't know. So far  we've only picked up one pattern spike," Jarvis shrugged.</p><p>"And they're too far out  of range to get more info?" Ranma bit her lip.</p><p>"The Assembly either  screwed up or they're trying to get our attention."</p><p>"So, just giving me a  heads up?"</p><p>Jarvis smirked. "The  Commander's sending a helicopter to investigate."</p><p>"And I bet there'll be  room." Ranma turned to Nodoka. "Hey Mom, what do you say to a field  test of your guns?"</p><p>"Can we?" Misako  enthusiastically asked as she cradled her gun. She relished the chance to show  it off to her former comrades.</p><p>"So you're asking to be  sent off to fight an unknown amount of Assemblymen?" Nodoka asked as she  inspected the gun that Ukyou had just fired.</p><p>"It's recon. We'll see  what's going on before doing anything," Ranma suggested.</p><p>"I'll inform the  Commander," Jarvis pulled out a phone. "You take your girls and get  ready by the warming helicopter." He said before talking to Stillwater.</p><p>"I guess these are ready  to go." Nodoka opened a second storage case and handed a holster, some  magazines, and a set of belts to Ukyou.</p><p>"Oooo... Leather  nice," Ukyou appraised as she shifted into her Senshi uniform and slipped  on the gun belt. At least she had some edge, especially since she had no idea  what her Senshi powers were.</p><p>"What about me?" Misako  pouted.</p><p>Nodoka smiled and handed a  pair of ammunition boxes over.</p><p>"You don't go  halfway," Kodachi noted with a tinge of jealousy.</p><p>"Accessories are  easy," Nodoka shrugged.</p><p>"You can go," Jarvis  said as he closed his phone.</p><p>"Right, let's go  girls," Ranma ordered.</p><p>Kodachi watched the demons run  off to the helicopter. She looked to the two officers and sighed. She walked  back to the building. She had thirty minutes before the flight back to the  Operations Centre.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"Starting to see  something," Ensign Lindemann said from the co-pilot's seat of the  helicopter. "Yes, display's showing a smattering of Pattern A, about five  klicks out ."</p><p>Ranma nodded to the sound  coming into her headset.</p><p>"Slowing down  approach," Lieutenant Hilbert, the pilot, stated.</p><p>"We're getting more of  them, looks like a couple squads. Levels are murky." Lindemann pause. "We've  got a bloom! It's two klicks out."</p><p>Hilbert's eyes widened.  "Shit!" he swore as a small smoke trail shot up from the forest  below. He jerked on the cyclic and pitched the helicopter up.</p><p>"Releasing  countermeasures." Lindemann released flares and chaff. "Base we're  under attack by AOM forces." The missile was evaded but then a bright  yellow beam came up from the ground.</p><p>The source of the beam moved  to try to connect with the helicopter. It was then joined by a second beam that  reached up and just missed the cockpit. Another pair of missiles shot up as  well. The helicopter twisted to evade but was hit in the transmission case. The  titanium armor quickly burned through. The two missiles hit chaff and exploded,  but a bit too close to the helicopter.</p><p>"Can you get us down  safe?" Ranma shouted.</p><p>Hilbert worked at the  controls. "Transmission's shot Ma'am. It's not good. I think I can get  this thing down with no power, though." Within the right domain of  velocity and altitude a helicopter can glide and land with some survivability. The  decent turns the unpowered rotor blades which generate enough lift to slow the  fall to what can be safe levels. The turning of the main rotor also turns the  tail rotor which maintains stability. The line bounding this domain was  affectionately known as the "Curve of Death".</p><p>"We're sitting  ducks," Lindemann said as the attacks continued. The ability to evade  dramatically fell with the helicopter.</p><p>"It's time for that thing  we trained for!" Ranma shouted.</p><p>Hilbert shuddered. There was  not even a clearing below; it was all forest. He sighed and unhooked his  harness. Lindemann followed.</p><p>Ranma grabbed the door gunner  next to her. "Nariko take the pilot. Misako take the co-pilot. Akane other  gunner."</p><p>The sextet of succubae jumped  out of the helicopter. Initially their wings were folded back, allowing them to  fall faster than the rotor-gliding helicopter. Once they had fallen enough the  succubae extended their wings and pulled out and away.</p><p>Ranma gritted her teeth as she  rolled away from a yellow beam and increased her descent. The brood had  practiced this maneuver before, but not under live fire. She hit the ground and  maintained enough balance to not drop Morrison. The agent gasped and landed on  the HOG that he had been clutching to his chest.</p><p>Ranma could feel all her spawn  but her thoughts were interrupted by hearing the helicopter lumbering down to  the ground. She hit the ground over Morrison and felt the impact in the  distance.</p><p>The agent and the succubus  rose. Ranma tapped his shoulder and pointed to the right. The two crept through  the forest. Shortly, the redhead looked over to see Nabiki and Ukyou silently  move towards her. Ranma's expression turned predatory when she heard gunfire  and explosions to the east.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Sailor Aurora smiled happily  as she depressed the trigger on her Individual Grenade Machine Gun. A MK 19  crew served weapon modified to be shoulder fired, the weapon was too ungainly  for a human to use, but Misako did not have that problem.</p><p>A series of 40mm high  explosive dual purpose grenades made short work of the flanking group of  acolytes.</p><p>"Shit," Lindemann  whispered as he held his sidearm. He managed to shoot the first Assemblyman in  the head but the rest... He gasped as he put some weight on his broken ankle.</p><p>Misako slapped him on the back  before getting up. "Sorry about the landing," she blushed. Mother was  going to yell at her for being sloppy.</p><p>Lindemann nodded.</p><p>"Thanks for ruining our  surprise," Nariko hissed from what seemed like Misako's ear.</p><p>"You see anyone?"  Misako asked.</p><p>"Some dumb kid,"  Nariko frowned. "Pulled a gun on Hilbert." She shrugged.</p><p>Hilbert paused as he took  position to the rear of the group and looked to the South. As soon as the  acolyte started to raise his weapon, Nariko was on him. It was gruesome but efficient.  "I see Akane and Stevenson!" he said quietly.</p><p>He crouched down and ran over  to the limping pair. Misako had followed, holding up her monstrous weapon.</p><p>Akane frowned and handed the  nearly unconscious Stevenson over to the officer. She growled as pain shot up  her damaged foot.</p><p>"Bad landing?"  Misako asked.</p><p>Akane nodded. She avoided the  missile well enough, nearly hit a tree, and then went into the ground.  "His arm's bad, I dunno about the rest."</p><p>"I should have guessed  you were this easy to find," Ranma smirked. She did a headcount and was  relieved with the result. "Anyone raise base?"</p><p>"I did," Lindemann  whispered. "I'll tell them we got everyone."</p><p>Ranma nodded as she looked at  Akane's leg. "It's okay dear," she said before yanking her foot.  There was a loud crack followed by a flood of Ranma's energy that was readily  absorbed.</p><p>"So far we've seen some  scouts. It's gonna get worse," Hilbert shook his head. It was insane, but  the training worked. He could smell the burning wreckage.</p><p>"Misako, stay with these  guys, give them some cover," Ranma ordered.</p><p>Frowning, Misako nodded.</p><p>Hilbert boggled at the  covering fire that offered. "We'll make sure no one gets in behind  you," he promised.</p><p>"I getting better,"  Stevenson groggily said He winced when Morrison looked at his arm.</p><p>"Try to go around them, a  bit to the North-west," Hilbert advised.</p><p>Ranma smiled. More distance  between them would be better. She motioned to the rest of her spawn and they  slid into the forest gloom. "That's good, we'll have to fan out and do a  full sweep anyway."</p><p>"Lucky guys," Misako  smirked as she extended her senses and began to unfold her aura.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Wendell Holmes held his  dagger-like blades out but he hesitated; a tiny demon in a pastel uniform of  some kind stepped out into his vision. His hesitation came not out of any  reluctance to kill a young girl, but from caution that came with experience.</p><p>He looked her over and checked  with his senses and concluded that she was no great threat. A blue aurora  formed over him as he ran to attack her. His men would hold back, until the  other demons that were certainly out there attacked.</p><p>Nabiki smirked and snapped her  hands together. The mocking look on the Assemblyman's face was worth waiting  for. "Icicle Parade."</p><p>Wendell laughed and put his  right arm up to block the ice barrage. He screamed when some of the shards  punctured through his aura. The number penetrating grew tremendously after the  first shards exploded. His right arm hung uselessly at his side, nothing more  than a broken, bleeding mass of meat. Aura flaring even brighter, he pushed  forward with the blade in his remaining hand.</p><p>Nabiki dodged back and parried  the blow with her claws. Getting inside the weapon, she pushed it aside and  slammed the her other hand into his neck.</p><p>Wendell's head snapped back  and he tried to slash with his rather short sword again. The tiny demon's  attacks railed uselessly against his shield. He stepped forward and found his  footing taken away.</p><p>He was then flipped over and  hit the ground. Glaring at the succubus standing over him, he stabbed forward  with his sword. It solidly stabbed somewhere in the demon and he felt assured  of his victory.</p><p>Wendell's acolytes' attentions  were drawn by a series of fireballs. The men hesitated. Wendell's face  reddened. "I can handle this little girl! Go after them!" he shouted  to the men as they turned and started shooting at the other demon.</p><p>Thanks to their cover the  fireballs from the demon failed to hit them and the sustained fire from their  guns kept her from getting too close. They were missing her but it was enough  to keep her from nearing. Most of the demon's attacks were close range.</p><p>Hearing his men engage the  demon trying to flank them, Wendell hastened to end this fight. He made a stab  for what he knew to be a vital area. Swearing as the blade hit her, Nabiki  sidestepped and managed to keep the wound from getting deep. Wendell smiled,  but his satisfaction was short lived as she repeated those stupid words.</p><p>"Icicle Parade!" A  blast of frozen flammables shot forward. Few of the shards actually made it  though his shield, and into his head, but not many were needed.</p><p>Nabiki arched her back and her  eyes flared as she dodged a handful of shots. Some of the Acolytes had noticed  what had happened to their leader, and were starting to fire on her. She slid  out her claws and leapt toward the acolytes who were still engaged in a  firefight. The three within ten feet of where she landed were doomed.</p><p>The rest of the squad were  further out and until now had focused their attention on the other demon, but  now there was another threat... One took a shot and hit a teammate who was  being eviscerated. He swore at the interference and tried to shoot the bulky  gun again but a blue and white fireball ended his efforts.</p><p>His partner was a bit more  clearheaded and took careful aim. Unfortunately, that caused him to miss a  group of shadows slide up and make contact with the one cast by his gun. However  he did not miss it when the weapon exploded in his hands.</p><p>Akane glared and adjusted her  shadows to the next target.</p><p>Aura flaring, Nabiki stepped  back and dodged under a burst of gunfire. She concentrated and launched a pair  of fireballs. She shook her head and slit the throats of the writhing  flame-consumed bodies.</p><p>"You shouldn't have gone  out like that," Akane admonished after impaling the last acolyte with her  tail.</p><p>"Yeah," Nabiki  agreed as she cracked open Holmes' chest. She then sliced out his heart and  tossed half of it to Akane.</p><p>Akane thoughtfully chewed the  organ as she sniffed the air. "Not bad. Shame we don't have time to sample  more." At least their uniforms worked well enough in combat, even if the  leather mini-skirts were too girly.</p><p>"I'm guessing this fool  was the one that sent those scouts out." Nabiki shrugged. She then spoke  into her headset. "Got one of the Priests, and a smattering of goons.  Pretty good eating."</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"We're ready," Ukyou  quietly groused.</p><p>Nariko shrugged. They had to  wait for everyone to be in position. Simultaneous attacks would minimize the  potential for reinforcements. She could sense something ahead but was not sure.  They eased their way further and stopped. She smiled thinly at the group of  acolytes.</p><p>"Mortars," Ukyou  whispered as she pointed. She radioed in her ready status, and thankfully only  had to wait a bit before getting the order. She then moved her finger to a man  that wore better armor than the others.</p><p>Nariko shook her head at the  stupidity. It was not just the armor, but the choice of heavy weapons. The  terrain was all wrong, and seemed ineffective at fast, highly mobile targets.  Maybe it could would work better against a swarm of minion-grade demons.  Shrugging, she circled around and kept an eye on the formation. She sniffed and  approached an idle sentry. Before his lifeless and heartless body could hit the  ground, she concentrated and shouted: "Lightning Devastation". Several  electric arcs came from her hands and hit the closer of the two mortar crews.</p><p>Several of the rounds  exploded, which further mangled the corpses that were once the crew. The other  mortar group was far enough to escape the explosion. They changed the position  of the small tube and started firing. The loader from that crew started to  raise his shotgun...</p><p>Ukyou drew her weapon, and  took careful aim with the enlarged semi-automatic. It was a bit clunky but  Grandma was not taking any chances with the .500 Smith and Wesson round. The  blonde easily and messily killed the two men at the mortar.</p><p>Ukyou moved her aim to their  leader but as soon as Nariko attacked he had dived down behind a hillock. There  was a brief pause and she then looked to see a squad of acolytes approach her  while running between trees and trying to use cover. She smirked; it looked  like he had called in some backup.</p><p>Her smirk died when she saw a  yellow beam fire from behind the hillock. She spotted the priest using some  kind of staff as covering fire. Heartened, the acolytes carefully went forward.  Father Holmes could not hit the demoness, but his fire kept her from coming out  into the open.</p><p>Ukyou swore, the bastard was  too concealed and too far away to hit. Besides she had more immediate targets.  Trying to flank her, the acolytes moved in; their assault weapons were raised. She  could smell the fear and hatred in them... she then realized that there was  more. She could smell more of their minds. She could touch them.</p><p>The squad shuddered and  hesitated in their advance. It was enough. From their varied positions, they  shot at her but they were far too low and off their mark. Ukyou's firing was  precise and devastating; she gasped, panicking that many people was exhausting.</p><p>She then advanced on the two  remaining personnel. Idly reloading she looked at the shivering acolyte. The  man gasped and as he looked at the approaching demon and reached for one of his  grenades. Immediately reacting, Ukyou pulled iron and shot him between the  eyes.</p><p>"Foul monster!" The  other one used the opportunity to take a shot. He hit Ukyou just under her left  shoulder and then he got shot in the neck and then the stomach. Screaming in  pain, the blonde lunged onto him and began to feed as she dug into her shoulder  to pull out the bullet. She growled as the wound painfully healed closed.</p><p>She stood back up and smiled  at the sight of Nariko gleefully frying her assemblymen. Ukyou frowned and  looked at the two bodies as she released the empty magazine and reloaded. At  least Franklin died quickly, he was not too bad of a guy. Hamilton on the other  hand... She felt she should have shot him in the crotch first.</p><p>Ukyou mumbled something about  pinching jerks that did not know the meaning of 'not interested' when she  spotted the priest. Father Karol Adams had emerged from the hillock</p><p>"Hello Ukyou," the  short and solid man greeted her with a forcefully calm face. He cradled a wooden  staff in his arms. He had called for more support and Oslo promised it, he just  needed to stall her. More men would come.</p><p>Ukyou smirked and spit out  some blood and gristle so she could talk. "Still being Oslo's whipping boy  I see."</p><p>Karol sighed as he looked at  the corpses. "You had such promise: clever enough to realize the truth yet  smart enough to keep your mouth shut about it."</p><p>"I defected as a  human," Ukyou reminded as her grip strengthened on her gun. Father Adams  was one of the less fanatical and more approachable</p><p>"Exactly," Karol  shrugged. That was his entire point. It was a shame, the Assembly needed more  people like Ukyou, not faithful dolts like Wendell. Karol flipped his staff  over and the prongs at the end began to glow. A thick yellow beam burst from  the tip and he tried to steer it towards the blonde.</p><p>Concentrating her fearsome  aura, Ukyou went to the ground, under the beam. She aimed and took a shot. Karol  reacted and turned the staff so the large bullet hit the middle. After it  smashed through the weapon, there was a blue flash of the slowed bullet impacting  with his shield.</p><p>"Not so sure about your  aura?" Ukyou taunted.</p><p>"What about yours? I'm no  weak fearful acolyte," Karol dropped the lower half of the staff and fired  again from the prongs, it was thinner and not as bright.</p><p>Ukyou tried to dodge but the  yellow beam hit her side, fortunately it ricocheted off of her flaming aura.  Aside from knocking her down the only damage was that the left side of her back  bow had been torn.</p><p>"Lightning  Devastation!" Nariko shouted. Bolts of electricity scattered over the  Assemblyman's shield and she pounced.</p><p>Karol turned and fired a shot  from his staff. It hit the center of her body, sending the succubus tumbling.  "Looks like my men actually slowed you down," he commented noticing  the handful bullet holes and slices in her uniform. There was a lot of blood  too, but he had no idea how much of it was hers.</p><p>There was a pair of shots and  Karol felt his back get torn open. His wounds healing, he spun around. He had a  feeling about her gun, and since it had penetrated his shield and his armor...</p><p>Nariko immediately popped back  up and launched a fireball. It burst harmlessly on his shield, but her  attention was on the ragged wounds on his back.</p><p>Ukyou grimaced and aimed at  the prongs at the end of the truncated staff. The wood and metal weapon  exploded nicely, but as she fired again he had closed the range.</p><p>Karol dropped the broken  pieces and flicked his wrists drawing out a pair of short blades from his sleeves.  The edges glowed and he jabbed forward. His right blade was blocked by Ukyou's  claws while his left was parried by the edge of her gun.</p><p>As the blade started to cut  into the slide of the gun, Karol pushed forward. He twisted his right arm and  tried to jab it into the succubus. A tail tried to cut his legs out but bounced  off his aura.</p><p>"Lightning  Devastation!" Nariko shouted. Karol's aura flickered and she fired a pair  of eyebeams into wounds that had been healing rapidly.</p><p>Karol tried to twist out and  get to the side; so he would not be sandwiched between a pair of demons. He  lifted his left hand off the gun and jabbed the dagger forward. Ukyou rotated  ninety decrees and rammed the gun forward. It met resistance on the blue aura  just over his head, until she depressed the trigger.</p><p>"Regenerate from  that," Ukyou said as she pushed the headless corpse to the ground.  "Thanks, Nari-chan," she gasped kneeling down over the body.</p><p>"Just save me some  liver," Nariko said, a smile gracing her bloodied face.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Ranma eased forward. She could  sense an assemblyman and could smell the rest of his goons. She looked forward  and saw a small foxhole with a pair manning a machine-gun. There were two more  similar positions that made a rough perimeter. She guessed that this was some  kind of redoubt: a place for the Assembly to retreat to. The redhead checked  and told her girls that she was in place and that they could start their  attacks.</p><p>She concentrated and silently  released a pair of DarkStar bursts at the two far foxholes. The gunner manning  the center one had his heart cut out by a pair of eyebeams. As the spheres  killed the other two crews Ranma flew in and slaughtered the gunner's partner.</p><p>Before she could get up and  move forward she saw a pair of men with tubes rise slightly and fire. A pair of  rockets shot out and raced towards Ranma. She concentrated and the unexploded  DarkStar bursts raced in and intercepted the missiles.</p><p>Once the explosion died down  Ranma looked to see another pair of rockets launch at her. She flicked her  hands out and hoped that they were cheap munitions. With beyond split second  precision and taking care to not touch the nosecones, she grabbed the rockets  at their midsection and knocked them aside.</p><p>One of the missiles spiraled  about and flopped onto the ground, exploding. The other, despite Ranma's  efforts, detonated a few feet away from her. More shrapnel went towards her  enemies, but her aura still spiked as some of it hit.</p><p>The closer pair had already  reloaded their rockets but the demoness was too close. Ranma grabbed one of the  men by his neck and launch tube. Only twenty feet away, his partner swiveled  his aim and shot at them.</p><p>As the rocket launched, Ranma  manhandled the bleeding acolyte so his body was between her and his partner.  She threw him right into the rocket's trajectory as her aura bloomed in violet  shadows.</p><p>The acolyte had dropped his  launch tube and taken a few paces back. Four men ran up to him confused and  fearful. Streamers of intestine and gore littered the trees and ground.</p><p>As they fired at the  demon she released a pair of orbs before running to the side. Some of the squad  went to the ground, two others scattered. Both of the pair that ran were  followed by the orbs, which rapidly closed the distance.</p><p>Ranma smiled at the pleasure  the energy the kills gave her and rushed into the three men who had held their  ground. She kept her aura and shadows up. Men with automatic weapons were more  of a threat to her than rockets. She could take out a handful of attacks, but a  concentrated and sustained volley of fire would be troubling.</p><p>"Shoot it!" A lanky  man shouted from the distance as he ran to the battle. Father Oslo was dismayed  at how fast the demon worked. In the few short minutes it took to relieve  himself, the slaughter of his men had begun. It was sad what a full bladder cost.</p><p>The demon pounced while they  fired. The missile-man, who was still hugging the ground, was easily taken with  her tail. The closer of the two who remained was unceremoniously gutted while  the other was fried with a more conventional fireball.</p><p>"Damn," Ranma swore  as she felt her aura perforate and the ribs on her left side shatter. She  growled as the healing began. Lung wounds were not fun. She pulled herself back  up, only to drop right back to the ground to dodge a yellow energy beam.</p><p>Oslo groaned. His men had  ample chances to fire on the monster, especially when she was distracted by  slaughtering the outermost barriers. "At least they managed to do some  damage," he hissed.</p><p>"Treat your men like bait  and that's all they'll be," Ranma said as she fired a DarkStar Burst at  the man while retreating behind a tree.</p><p>Oslo took aim with his staff  and swore when the black and violet orb bobbed down and avoided the beam. Concentrating  on the sphere, he did not see the pair of violet beams that glanced the pronged  end of his staff, which then blew apart weakly and died down in intensity. He  stole a glance and realized that all his men were dead. He radioed his other  teams for reinforcements, and the reliable Pinktree said he was coming. The  longer the fight lasted the better his odds got; he was the one getting  reinforcements.</p><p>The priest tossed the inert  staff to the ground and immediately grabbed a pair of long blades that were slung  under his coat. He held the blades up at ninety degrees with each other, vertical  and horizontal, and intercepted the DarkStar burst. The shards failed to slice  though the shield generated between the two blades</p><p>Oslo shifted to the side and  stabbed forward against the attacking demon. Ranma dodged under the blades and  closed in. She growled when he stepped back and parried her claws.</p><p>He leaned forward and slashed  at her while Ranma went down and grabbed him by his the knee and yanked him  over. While Oslo tumbled backwards he tried to slash at her waist but was  parried by her tail, which was nicked on its left fin.</p><p>As Ranma sidestepped the  tumbling man, she grabbed his left, wrist breaking, it and flicked his sword  away. Oslo stabbed forward with his other hand. Ranma freed up both her hands.  The end of the blade was caught between her claws, which sliced the sword apart  when it was yanked form her grip.</p><p>Oslo dropped the handle and  shot a blade out from within his sleeve. Before he could throw the knife it was  plucked from his hand and tossed aside. Ranma sighed and blocked a punch  sloppily thrown from his broken left hand.</p><p>Pulling himself up, Oslo  kicked high and found his leg captured by her claws. The aura prevented him  from being sliced apart, but not from having his knee broken. Trying to step  back, Oslo pulled out a grenade which was shot out of his hand by a pair of  eyebeams.</p><p>"Already seen that  trick," Ranma remarked. Flipping out another set of blades, Oslo charged  forward and was easily dodged. She frowned, he was nimble, but not enough.</p><p>When he started an  incantation, Ranma readied herself. Reaching into his coat, Oslo smirked and  produced an array of blades, one held between each finger. They were then  flicked out and jabbed into the succubus. Ranma twisted and was shocked to find  that all the flying blades adjusted their trajectory and had still hit her. She  groaned and slumped back.</p><p>Oslo chuckled as the succubus  coughed up blood, and curled up. He smirked, his aim was still good. "You  got me worried for a bit there, but there's now two blessed blades where your  heart should be. Not to mention the others piercing the rest of your body,"  he said as he pulled out another set of longer blades. He was relieved to see  that the chemicals coating the surface of the blades was retarding her  regeneration.</p><p>To his surprise, the succubus  jerkily rose and ripped the blades out of her body. She darkly smiled as blood  oozed out of the numerous wounds. It was clear that there was little pressure  in her major arteries. Oslo reacted and launched another barrage that was then  blocked by the blades she held. "Don't group me with those other weak  succubae you kill," she gasped as the shadows around her grew. She then  tossed the blades she held and tried to stab them into Oslo's body.</p><p>Dodging the attack so that  only two of the blades hit him, Oslo stared as black and violet fluid started  to pulsate within her chest cavity. The demoness gasped and ran in and slashed  at him. Her hair bounced up and seemed to hang before slowly falling back down.  The aura gave a bit of brief resistance but was easily overcome. Oslo tried to  stab forward but found his wrist grabbed and broken for a second time. Ranma  sighed and extended her claws and crushed through his aura. She felt her body  grow distant, but focused on the battle. Already her circulatory system was  trying to repair itself.</p><p>Screaming, Oslo drew his  sliced up right hand back. When his aura flickered, Ranma smiled. She reached  out and nearly touching his body, fired a DarkStar Burst. The orb shattered  onto his aura which blanked out. Shards sliced through his armor and exploded  in his abdomen.</p><p>Oslo lurched forward and  stabbed with a blade held in his good hand. The clumsy effort was blocked and  ripped away. Ranma was disappointed: he was not even pulling out the blades.</p><p>Gasping, Oslo stepped back. He  could still heal, and she was damaged too. Careful to protect his left arm, he  made a grab for another grenade. The demon attacked but his body and shield  blocked her. After pulling the pin, he tossed the grenade and was dismayed to  find it kicked away in midair. The split second he spent watching it sail  across the forests was enough, and he soon found his left arm sliced off at the  elbow. Oslo extended his neck and bit the grip of one of the blades stuck high  in his chest. Straining, he pulled it out and charged at Ranma.</p><p>"Oh please," Ranma  sighed as she grabbed his head with one hand, his shoulder with the other and  twisted. Ranma chuckled darkly. His heartbeat was still strong. She pushed the  body down and began to feed. As her body cooled down she almost slumped. Her  chest was in dire need of healing, fortunately she had plenty of energy and  food.</p><p>The shadows in the forest grew  long as she chewed and drained.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Father Randy Pinktree ran through  the forest. He sensed his comrade's fates and knew what he had to do. Before he  could get to Oslo, the man was killed. After feeling that, he took his men and  looped around the forest. Getting his men out was more important. He could  catch hell from the Bishop, but he did not care. He did not even care about the  risk of dealing with the Inquisitorial branch. Avoiding the three groups of  demons, he then switched direction to head south. Surrender did not even enter  his mind; his men would never accept it, and neither would he.</p><p>It was all a mess. Oslo had  assured them that these demons were too young and too small in number to be a  risk, especially when they were outnumbered ten to one. Their plan was simple,  taking out the helicopter was the hard part. Mopping up the demons was supposed  to be easy. The problems started when the spotters started being picked off. It  got worse when the fighting started.</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted  by an explosion that blew apart the men on his right flank. Pinktree ducked  down and motioned for his missile crew to the front. As that happened he eased  back and made for his blades.</p><p>A steady stream of explosions  pounded the ground, this time it was more towards the center of his men, who,  in the panic of their flight, had made the mistake of bunching up. One of his  rocket teams was cut down in the barrage. His men scrambled back.</p><p>"There's a whole Company  platoon there," one of the acolytes at the front shouted as he tried to  drag back a wounded man. There was a large hole in his chest.</p><p>Pinktree swore, he had hoped  to wheel around the company reinforcements. His eyes widened when he noticed a  dull green aura shoot out and envelope the two scouts. They screamed and  slumped over. Unlike Oslo, he did not intend to use his men as bait.</p><p>Randy turned away from the shriveling  bodies to see a shadowy and winged figure raise an enormous gun. "Percy  take her out!" he shouted to his remaining missile-man.</p><p>Before Acolyte Percival Blank  could fire he was shot in the head by a tight grouping of 7.62 mm bullets.  Randy shouted for his men to get down as another volley came at them.</p><p>Ordering his remaining men  forward, Randy glowered at how things had gone. Things were supposed to be  easy. The enemy was not supposed to counterattack, not right away.</p><p>Misako stepped back and fired  at the still distant men. She smirked, the fools just kept getting closer. She  knew the Assembly, they hardly ever fought... professionals, so they felt the  need to think like them.</p><p>The remaining acolytes did  make good use of cover and advanced in a pretty good leapfrog maneuver, but  they completely missed the slight concavity in the wooded hill they were  climbing up.</p><p>Only two of the WIC agents had  HOGs but combined with Misako's beast the sum of heavy weapons fire was a fine  hammer for the kill zone. After a couple bursts from the men on her flanks the  firing stopped and Misako advanced. She unfolded her aura and the green  tendrils spread, seeking those that were still alive.</p><p>Randy's men screamed even  louder before gurgling and finally falling silent. Gazing at the crumbled and  desiccated bodies, he flared his shield and retreated. He pulled back and found  some cover. He considered his options: fight or retreat.</p><p>The Bishop had to know. The  demons were much stronger than expected. Randy sighed and listened for the  approaching monster. Retreating could be tricky, the bishop would likely punish  him for his failure.</p><p>"Come out," Misako  taunted as she fired her gun a couple of times.</p><p>Randy threw a grenade, but its  range was nothing compared to those the demon was using</p><p>Misako caught a glimpse of him  and laughed. "Hey Father Pinktree! I've got a question," she  bellowed. "There are two types of Assemblyman. Those that believe the  stupid shit and the cynical bastards just do it to advance."</p><p>"There's also the poor  fools that go into the Inquisition branch."</p><p>"Don't tell me Porter got  his <i>promotion</i>?" Misako snickered. "He always was a  special kind of useful idiot."</p><p>Despite himself Randy darkly laughed."  I always took you for a true believer, Hibiki!"</p><p>Misako chuckled. "I got  better. What about you?"</p><p>Randy got up and ran to a  different bit of cover. He knew Misako was playing with him, but he could use  it.</p><p>"Come on, I've got a bet  with Ukyou." Misako eased forward. "She's more of the cynical type,  but she has a point. It's not like you guys would be dumb enough to actually  believe that stuff right?"</p><p>Randy shivered. She had a  point. The Assembly had all the theological expertise of a delicatessen.</p><p>Misako knew this was getting  tiresome, and mother did stress the importance of minimizing banter with your  enemy... even if the enemy was an old teacher. She took aim and fired a barrage  at him and immediately rushed.</p><p>Disappointingly, Randy had a  huge gash in his left leg. There were wounds on his face and torso but they  were not affecting his mobility. He hopped up and brandished a blade.</p><p>"Want me to wait for you  to regenerate that?" Misako sincerely asked.</p><p>Randy looked back and then  down at his leg. He threw a few long knifes, which surprisingly almost hit.  "No, it might as well end now." He defiantly glared and was  subsequently shot. Misako widened her eyes at the jump Pinktree made; he evaded  enough of the blast radius to live.</p><p>"You're getting cocky, you  always did," Randy gasped, now that both his legs were hideously damaged.</p><p>"Yes sir," Misako  nodded solemnly as her aura unfolded. "Thanks for the last lesson."  The green waves shot out and started to envelop him. Weakened legs failed and  the body was sucked dry. The orange haired succubus stood over the desiccated  body and set it ablaze. After it was reduced to ash, she returned back to the  agents.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"Hi Mom!" Akane  beamed when she sensed her mother striding forward. She then blinked. "Wow...  new look?"</p><p>"I like it," Nabiki  complimented. She watched the redheaded demoness stride out of the shadows, or  try to. The shadows seemed to hang about her, especially around her hair. The  succubus' hair was now a very rich and deep shade of red and fell to her butt  in a very full bodied and almost animated wave. Her tresses seemed to move to  conflicting eddies of wind and force.</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"It looks like you were  at the salon," Nabiki dryly said. There was a lot of blood on Mother, but  that was expected.</p><p>Ranma pulled back some of her  hair and was surprised at the length and shine. "Well, that's almost worth  the damage," she said as she fluffed her hair.</p><p>Nabiki smiled. "I called  the other groups. And they're done. It's now cleanup," she said wiping  some blood off her chin.</p><p>"Looks like you girls are  done here." The proud mother looked over the cleaned bodies. "Let's  get Ukyou and Nariko." The trio carefully walked through the forest until  they found a dead body that was surprisingly whole.</p><p>"Don't," Ukyou said  to Akane who was eyeing the corpse. "Franklin was okay," she sighed  an pointed to another body. "You can eat him. He was a prick."</p><p>Nariko looked at Akane and  frowned. "Where're your manners?"</p><p>Akane blinked.</p><p>"We're not savage  monsters," Nariko waggled a finger disapprovingly. "We have more  class than that."</p><p>Ukyou rolled her eyes.  "Yes, she insisted that we eat neatly." After pausing to look at her  mother's hair, she shrugged- she had come to expect stuff like that from  Mother.</p><p>"I like your hair,"  Nariko said as they walked back to where the brood left Misako and the agents.</p><p>'Thanks," Ranma smiled.</p><p>"Cute powerup."</p><p>"Yes I see that,"  Ukyou smirked. "So her powerup was better hair?"</p><p>Ranma laughed as they walked.  "Girls, I'm not a video game."</p><p>"Least, I'll have plenty  of meat for those recipes, right Mom?" Ukyou asked. Many of the recipes in  BlackSky's cookbook required... exotic ingredients.</p><p>"Uh, sure. We'll just  have to make sure Dr. Tofu doesn't want any specimens of his own.," Ranma  shrugged.</p><p>"Nice," Akane  smiled.</p><p>"Mom!" Misako said  as she bounded over, her gun slung across her back.</p><p>"Well, you're  happy," Ranma said as she hugged her.</p><p>Misako happily nuzzled her.  She thought about Pinktree and frowned briefly.</p><p>Ranma laughed at her girls'  energy and waved to the group of agents that had congregated.</p><p>"Good to see you  girls," Lieutenant Hilbert said as he sipped some water. He shook his head  at the gore that covered the girls.</p><p>"Impressive work,"  Captain Jarvis said as he came up a hill that Misako had used for an ambush.</p><p>"How's the  perimeter?" Ranma asked as she sipped from an offered canteen.</p><p>"A couple of acolytes may  have escaped before we came, but it's secure now."</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "How's  Stevenson?"</p><p>"He's resting in an APC.  Medic thinks he'll be okay." Jarvis shook his head. The results were  impressive, but he had come to expect this level of performance.</p><p>"Any other AOM on the  scanners?" Ranma tried to dust some of the blood from her chest.</p><p>Jarvis smirked and  deliberately looked past Ranma. "Nope. They could have planned something,  but our reinforcements only took out a handful people trying to flee. We tried  to capture some, but those few we got close to killed themselves instead. Guess  they were afraid we'd feed them to you."</p><p>"Yeah, you'd have thought  they would have helped their own men." Ranma smirked sarcastically. She  had seen first hand the kind of teamwork the Assembly had.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"What did you do?" Kasumi  asked as she hosed off her fiance. Both were behind the house. The brood was  driven straight back home. She let the others go in and shower inside the  house, but the redheaded mom was far too messy.</p><p>"Some guy exploded right  next to me," Ranma said as she scrubbed down her nude body.</p><p>"You should have cleaned  up at base, instead of coming over here first." Kasumi admonished.</p><p>Ranma shrugged.</p><p>"You also got hit in the  heart," Nodoka noted from the deck. She was examining Ukyou's gun. The  damage to the slide was a pain, but that part could be replaced. Right now she  was more interested in the prototype's overall performance and wear.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Ranma  sighed and turned so her hair could be washed. "Hope the guys on cleanup  are gonna be okay."</p><p>"You helped get most of  the bodies," Kasumi stated. She was off duty and by the time she had been  alerted, there was just mop up.</p><p>"I meant the helicopter.  It'll be a pain to get the wreckage," Ranma shivered at the chill.</p><p>"Expensive too," Nodoka  put down Ukyou's gun and then slid Misako's monster closer. "The Assembly  made a huge mistake." She smiled at the large case on the deck. A very  exuberant batch of broodlings had given it to her. There were more at base.  Nodoka would normally get all the captured weapons from a fight like this, but  the personal touch was really nice. And those staffs the Assembly used should  be fascinating.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Losing  fifty-one men will do that." The count was impressive, not just in her  girl's proficiency, but how scattered the Assembly was. Looking down she  shrugged. It was a shame, but those idiots attacked her family and friends.</p><p>"There's another  thing," Kasumi smirked. "They just gave the Company a reason."</p><p>"Good," Ranma smiled  darkly and took the offered towel. She then brushed a few snarls out of her  hair.</p><p>Nodoka smiled her daughter's  new style was quite lovely. "You two going to have fun?"</p><p>Kasumi nodded as Ranma nuzzled  the taller teen.</p><p>"Have fun you two,"  Nodoka smiled. She called the agents in the APC to help her load the weapons.  Her daughter would not be the only one with a busy night.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Ranma happily draped herself over  Kasumi's chest and purred while her tail happily swished back and forth. Kasumi  wiped some sweat off of her forehead and then massaged the succubus. "So  you split up and attacked at once?" She asked the redhead</p><p>Not wanting to talk, the  demoness simply nodded.</p><p>"You divided your forces,  but you hampered their ability to reinforce and counter attack." Kasumi  pondered as she held the demon.</p><p>Ranma nuzzled Kasumi's chest.  "That's about right."</p><p>"Misako worked well with  the guys. I'm surprised." Kasumi then kissed the succubus.</p><p>Purring Ranma continued and  then broke off. "They fought well. She likes them, especially  Morrison."</p><p>Kasumi blinked. "Because  he killed that minion with his knife."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "That and  he signed up for the D program."</p><p>"Oh?" Kasumi asked,  flatly. Establishing a procedure like that was logical but disturbing.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Yeah, Misako  thinks he'd make a great succubus."</p><p>"So do you," Kasumi  noted. No longer stroking Ranma.</p><p>"Yeah, I respect him, that's  why I let him in." Ranma's voice was distant.</p><p>"He's a good guy,"  Kasumi allowed.</p><p>"Have you made your  decision?" Ranma asked, pulling her head off Kasumi's chest.</p><p>Kasumi looked to the ceiling  for a long moment, and the demon began to fidget during the awkward silence.  "No."</p><p>"Well..."</p><p>"Going to go back to your  kids?" Kasumi asked with deliberate casualness.</p><p>Ranma eased out of Kasumi's  bed. "Yeah I should," she leaned over and kissed her fiancee. With a  perplexed glance she slipped out of the room.</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Genma noticed Ranma enter the  kitchen. His child seemed distant. "Did things go alright last  night?"</p><p>"You know what we  did," Ranma grumped as she poured some juice in her "World's Greatest  Mother" mug.</p><p>"You seemed happy enough  after the... fight," Genma shuddered. The master was training him, but he  saw the happy succubae arrive home.</p><p>"Hmm?" Ranma asked.</p><p>The older martial artist's  eyes flickered around the room. Happosai's return had heightened his danger  sense. He could almost see the irritation roll off of the redhead. "It  happened after you and your fiance..."</p><p>"Had wild sex? What of  it? She's my mate." Ranma glared at her father. She carefully lowered her  mug to the table, and started looking in the cabinet for some breakfast.</p><p>Genma sighed and steeled  himself. She was just like her mother. She was at her maddest when she was  controlled and calm. "Daughter... please, just don't... Don't make the  same mistake I did."</p><p>Ranma spun around and stared  at her father. "Daughter?" she asked with confusion.</p><p>Genma stepped back, eyeing the  door. "I'm sorry."</p><p>"What got you?" she  asked, picking up her mug again.</p><p>Genma looked around, and then  quietly whispered. "The Master."</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow. "Old  man Happosai?"</p><p>"Don't say his name!"  Genma's eyes widened and he looked about to bolt to the door.</p><p>"Good morning!"  Happosai said as he bounded into the room and landed on Ranma's chest.</p><p>"Says you," Ranma  sighed and sipped her drink.</p><p>"Now this is a  student," Happosai said as he fondled her breasts. He then allowed himself  to be swatted aside.</p><p>"Yah had your fun,"  Ranma half heartedly grumbled.</p><p>"Aww, but I just want to  see how my lovely gifts fit on you," the diminutive old man's eyes started  to tear up and his lip quivered.</p><p>"The bra and panties fit  great," Ranma rolled her eyes. "And Kasumi really liked the black  negligee you got me."</p><p>"Yes I heard,"  Happosai gave a saucy grin. "Though are you always so morose at the  end?"</p><p>"It's none of your  business," Ranma sniffed. "We're just having fun."</p><p>"Yeah, casual sex should  be easy for a succubus," Happosai lit his pipe. "But is it  casual?"</p><p>"Yeah, the Master's  right." Genma blinked.</p><p>"See? Even this bumbling  oaf figured it out. And his marriage fell apart." Happosai knowingly  puffed on the long pipe.</p><p>"Things are fine, we're  still casual enough," Ranma shook her head and left out the back door and  headed to the dojo.</p><p>"There might be hope for  you yet," Happosai said to Genma.</p><p>Genma tried to ease his way  out of the room.</p><p>Happosai seemed to not notice.  "Well, your daughter and her spawn are going to have the dojo. Guess I'll  have to teach you the old fashioned way." He slapped Genma on the back.  "Come on! It's half an hour past sunrise! The day's a wasting."</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>Without a pause in her  singing, Ranma caught the motion Morrison made. The agent was sitting at the  bar and had a cell phone in his ear. Ranma smirked. Like a few others in the  bar, the new woman did not look away from the singing seductress. Ranma flashed  a sultry smile at the visitor and added in a saucy wink. Almost ruining the  song, she suppressed laughter at the newcomer's uncomfortable fidgeting.</p><p>After finishing her set, Ranma  slid off of the tiny stage and eased up to the wayward Senshi. "You've got  a lot of guts waltzing in here," Ranma then ordered a drink. "Your  mistress give you the night off?" she mockingly asked while sipping.</p><p>Mercury narrowed her eyes and  tried to keep from blushing.</p><p>"Oh, lighten up. You had  to know you'd have been watched."</p><p>"Yes, you actually keep  competent security," Mercury stated. She knew how exposed she was. It was  a public place, but it was controlled by Ranma and her Company allies.</p><p>"So why are you  here?" Ranma asked as she motioned for Mercury to sit in a secluded corner  booth.</p><p>"I heard about this great  redheaded singer who was dominating karaoke night," Mercury idly stated.</p><p>"The Red Turtle doesn't  do karaoke on Friday, you should know that, Akumi," Ranma sipped at her  scotch and ordered one for the blue-haired girl.</p><p>Mercury watched the waitress  leave. "Akumi? Cute." Shoving Aku into her name was not quite the  impression she wanted to give, but it was a lot better than Dark Mercury.</p><p>"It fits... and you're  dressed adorably," Ranma smiled at Mercury's glare.</p><p>"Figures." Mercury should  have expected that a succubus would find her commanding black, with blue  accent, evening dress adorable. "And is my hair cute too?"</p><p>"It's no pigtails, but  there's something to be said for the elegance of a nice bun." Ranma ran a  hand through her own teased, fluffed, and spiked mane.</p><p>"We can't all look like  eighties hair band members," Mercury dryly remarked. She looked at the  liquor placed before her. She was fairly sure that the succubus' hair was  longer and fuller, but that was not too unexpected.</p><p>"I'm not the one in a  nice corset." Ranma smirked. "Don't be a pansy, drink up. You sneak  into a bar looking classy, you gotta do something with it."</p><p>"And you're a  mother," Mercury shook her head</p><p>"And you're supposed to  be some evil and dread Mistress to a powerful queen." Ranma sighed.  "So what do you want?"</p><p>Mercury sniffed her Scotch.  She coughed after trying to drink some of it down.</p><p>Ranma smiled thinly.  "Warm isn't it?"</p><p>Mercury nodded. "I'm  asking about your plans for... Usagi," she said as she played with her  glass.</p><p>Ranma sipped her drink and  studied Mercury's face. It was clear and controlled but fear still radiated  from her. "Oh I dunno." Ranma smiled warmly at the memory of Usagi's  bloody visage. The princess had potential. That hug was really good too.</p><p>Mercury glared.</p><p>"Well, what do you plan  to do with her?" Ranma asked as she put her glass down. "You're a bit  too cold to be a consort," she teased. The redhead grinned at the other  girl's narrowed eyes. "You're taking this far too seriously."</p><p>Blinking, Mercury took another  sip. "I serve the Princess. We need to be worthy of her."</p><p>Ranma sniffed her drink. It  was not as good as what Stillwater had, but it did the job. "And that you  had the perfect little honey-pot to encourage your... blooming was just a happy  coincidence?"</p><p>"Yes, that was  helpful." Mercury smirked. "So what are your plans for her?"</p><p>Ranma scratched her neck.  "Nothing much. It's not like I have some despicable agenda in all  this."</p><p>"Right," Mercury  chuckled. There was no way Ranma could have just fallen into the network of  alliances that she had.</p><p>"So where's your minions?  Didn't want to bring them to such a risque show?" Ranma teased.</p><p>"They're training,"  Mercury said flatly. "Virgo is a useful asset but..."</p><p>"You need to keep her on  a short leash." Ranma offered.</p><p>"She's still learning  what it means to be a Senshi, one of my Senshi," Mercury emphasized.</p><p>"Don't have that problem  with Orion," Ranma took another sip. "No, she taught you."</p><p>"Well, having a lover  that understands you completely is good, don't you agree?" Mercury  pointedly asked.</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma  absently noted. "So you're already dressing darkly and doing the new  makeup and such, standard teenage rebellion. What next? Tattoos?</p><p>Despite herself, Mercury  blushed ever so slightly.</p><p>"Ah ha! So what did you  get? Mark your territory? Or maybe a more even exchange."</p><p>"It's personal,"  Mercury said, demurely.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "I didn't  see anything on your battle uniform, but I would expect you to be discrete and  elegant."</p><p>"That a compliment?"</p><p>"Sure why not,"  Ranma shrugged.</p><p>Mercury frowned.</p><p>"What? Were you expecting  more cloak and dagger? We are in a dark bar with plenty of armed men and demons  about."</p><p>"And we are discussing  massive conspiracies over drinks," Mercury added with a ghost of a smile.</p><p>"That's the spirit!"  Ranma stretched her shoulders. "I mean what's the point of having it and  not have fun with it."</p><p>Mercury paused. "You're  encouraging me?"</p><p>"You look like you've got  potential," Ranma smirked.</p><p>Behind her slight smile  Mercury's mind raced. DarkStar was really quite cunning and she exuded a casual  and almost bumbling sense. Mercury could see why so many could make the mistake  of underestimating her.</p><p>"Attempting to discern my  nefarious machinations regarding you, are we?" Ranma asked, recalling some  of the words her youngest daughter used.</p><p>"Not at all."  Mercury said carefully.</p><p>"This is exactly what I  mean. You're starting to get there, but anyone with training can read your  emotions plain as day." Ranma leaned closer to Ami. "You're still  green. Some experience will help you."</p><p>Mercury stared into the  demon's violet eyes. She pulled herself back.</p><p>Ranma sniffed at the slight  spike in fear. "Oh come on. If I really thought you were a threat I  wouldn't be chatting with you. You know that."</p><p>"You don't play with your  food." Mercury flatly stated.</p><p>Ranma ran a finger over the  rim of her glass</p><p>"I heard what happened  two nights ago." Mercury said, in almost a whisper.</p><p>The redhead cocked her head;  there was something else in her voice. "You're jealous?"</p><p>"Shouldn't I be? You're  the real deal, got the full dark aura, squad of dedicated and trained Senshi,  connections, and plenty of experience. You took out an army of trained demon  hunters."</p><p>"It was more like a platoon  and they were prepared to fight minion grade demons."</p><p>Mercury gritted her teeth. The  humility was the annoying part.</p><p>"Temper." Ranma noted. "You're  not the first brooding, dark-power-using teenage girl I've seen."</p><p>"You don't think I've  been brainwashed and manipulated?" Mercury flatly asked.</p><p>"I've dealt with that  too," Ranma shrugged. "No big deal."</p><p>"Too mellow,"  Mercury muttered.</p><p>"No one respects a  jittery and anxious dark mistress." Ranma leaned back and sipped.  "From what I hear you kept yourself together in that little fight of  yours."</p><p>"They were less  incompetent than I feared."</p><p>"I suppose that's  good," Ranma allowed.</p><p>"So, you're suggesting  that I keep my cool? Like that time? That would match with me being the  proactive one. I'm the one determining the tempo of events."</p><p>"Of course that means you  have to make the first move every time." Ranma's eyes glowed slightly.</p><p>Staring into those eyes,  Mercury froze. She suddenly imagined the demon sweeping across the booth with  her claws out. Mercury knew she could parry the first blow, but not whatever  came next. The demon would immediately follow up with any number of varied  attacks.</p><p>"Something wrong?"  Ranma idly asked as she flicked a bit of lint off of her dress.</p><p>"No," Mercury  stated, as she managed to keep from shivering.</p><p>"It worked?" Ranma's  face brightened. "So how was it?" the succubus excitedly asked.</p><p>Mercury's face blanked.  "You..."</p><p>"Yeah, demons can put out  fear. Now Ucchan's got a great knack for it, but... it's easier to make someone  already frightened of you scared-shitless. These little tricks would never work  on a Company officer."</p><p>"You're toying with  me." Mercury grumbled. "No, you're training."</p><p>"Everything is  training," Ranma stated. "You hid it pretty well. Didn't even try to  fight back or pull a weapon."</p><p>Mercury smiled thinly and  raised her glass. "You would never warn someone just before attacking.  It'd be sudden, brutal, and vicious."</p><p>"Bright girl," Ranma  laughed.</p><p>"One has to watch for the  slightest sign." Mercury surmised.</p><p>"Pretty much."</p><p>The blue-haired girl's eyes  scanned about the bar. "So how's things been going with your lesbian  lover?"</p><p>"She's not a  lesbian." Ranma stated.</p><p>"Right," Mercury  smirked. "Me neither."</p><p>"You used to be  straight."</p><p>"I guess it is different  with succubae, with being all female, but you do seem to have that effect on  other women."</p><p>"Like the Princess?"  Ranma mirthfully asked.</p><p>Once again, Mercury attempted  to forestall a blush.</p><p>"Has she always had an  eye for the ladies?"</p><p>"You've already got a  fiancee," Mercury pointed before taking another drink.</p><p>Ranma frowned slightly.  "Just teasing. It's not like she'd be interested anyway."</p><p>"Yes, she's still waiting  for her prince to return," Mercury frustratingly said.</p><p>"So you feel  better?" Ranma asked. "I'll tell you. It took some guts."</p><p>"To walk into a bar and  chat with a lounge singer?" Mercury asked. "Look, I don't want there  to be any bad blood between us."</p><p>"You mean you don't want  me to interfere with your plans for the Senshi." Ranma mirthfully  surmised.</p><p>Mercury finished her drink.  "You haven't so far. You were right there at the start. You could have  ended it then and there, but you let me go."</p><p>"Makes you think doesn't  it?" Ranma asked as she finished her own drink.</p><p>"You have your own plans,  and I'm a part of them."</p><p>Ranma laughed. "I'm just  a single mom doing her best."</p><p>Mercury stood up. "It was  pleasant talking with you. Thanks for the drink."</p><p>"My pleasure," Ranma  nodded. "Oh, don't do anything too rash, kid. I don't think you want to push  Usagi to the edge."</p><p>"Don't worry I know  exactly what I'm doing," Mercury laughed gently and turned around. She  walked out of the bar and passed an orange-haired demon who simply glared  amusingly at her.</p><p>"Are you sure you don't  want me to take care of her?" Misako asked as she slid into the booth with  her Mother.</p><p>Ranma smiled. Misako's concern  for her was cute. "Nah, we'll let the Company track her." the redhead  crunched an ice cube.</p><p>"She's arrogant, Mother.  It'll be her downfall," Misako evaluated.</p><p>"Maybe, but I think she's  trying to overcome that."</p><p>1<br/>2<br/>3<br/>12345678987654321<br/>3<br/>2<br/>1</p><p>"What's wrong?"  Ranma calmly asked when she entered Kasumi's room. There was nothing obvious,  but the atmosphere felt dampened emotionally. Something was amiss.</p><p>Kasumi inhaled slightly  raggedly and stood up.</p><p>The redhead noticed the object  on the night-stand and eased over to Kasumi. "Did you have a bad day at  work?" she asked hugging the officer.</p><p>Kasumi hesitated but put her  hands on the demon's shoulders, and gently pushed her away so they were face to  face.</p><p>Furrowing her brow, Ranma  paused; something was definitely up. Kasumi only took her gun off when they  were about to have sex, and she did not look like she was anywhere near the  mood for that. "What happened?"</p><p>"I didn't have work  tonight." Kasumi looked at her fiance briefly.</p><p>"Then why did you  lie?" Ranma pulled her arms away and stared more closely at Kasumi's face.  "You could have told me that you didn't want to listen to me sing."</p><p>"This is too much,"  Kasumi closed her eyes.</p><p>"What?" Ranma's tone  was confused.</p><p>"We're not seeing eye to  eye on this."</p><p>"Yeah, you keep looking  away from me, and not explaining things. This isn't how mates are supposed to  talk," Ranma grumbled.</p><p>"There! That's what I  mean," Kasumi bitterly laughed.</p><p>"What? We're  engaged."</p><p>Kasumi backed to the  nightstand and looked at her sidearm, and focused her mind. "I don't know  how to say this."</p><p>"What?" Ranma asked;  the shadows around her starting to frantically shift.</p><p>Kasumi kept her back to the  redhead. "This isn't working out. You want more than I can give."</p><p>At those words, Ranma's heart  froze for a moment before it resumed beating. She swallowed hard. "Go  on."</p><p>"You want a mate, someone  to help raise your daughters."</p><p>"They're your sisters,  too."</p><p>Kasumi's shoulders sagged and  she turned and sat on the edge of her bed. "Exactly. I can't become their  mother. It's..." She stared at the wall. She felt selfish, but that was  the truth. She was all that was left, her father was ineffectual and could not  face the reality of events. The Company brass did not care either way. She had  no guide.</p><p>Ranma froze.  "So..."</p><p>Kasumi turned to face Ranma.  "I didn't mean to... Well, I meant to have sex with you. We had fun as a  couple, but I can't be the mate you want. I'm sorry." Her voice had the  careful modulation and pace of a practiced delivery.</p><p>"We'll try to be casual  again, I can-" Ranma's tone carried an undertone of desperation.</p><p>Kasumi cut her off. "No,  you can't. You're a sappy demon Mommy. You don't do casual."</p><p>Ranma stared; she could not  think of anything to say that would refute that.</p><p>Staring at her hands Kasumi  collected herself. "I know you'd try. You'd keep it just physical."  She smiled. "But it would just hurt you. Your heart would break every time  we had sex, everytime you wanted to connect to me, but couldn't out of fear of  losing what little relationship you had."</p><p>"How, nice of you,"  Ranma half-cried; she paused to keep her emotions under control. "I  guess... it's good that you don't want to string me along."</p><p>"I'm sorry." Kasumi  kept staring at her hands. "I should have ended this earlier."</p><p>"Yes, you should  have," Ranma stepped back and looked at the door.</p><p>"Sorry," Kasumi  repeated.</p><p>Staring at Kasumi, Ranma  stepped out of the room. Once in the hallway she looked at her, and the  brood's, bedroom and then at the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs she looked  into the living room to find her father sitting alone. He was drinking from a  glass and was not surprised to see her emotional state.</p><p>Genma looked up. "I'm  sorry, daughter."</p><p>Ranma controlled her hurt and  forced a smile. "You warned me, Pops. You tried."</p><p>"Go back to your girls.  They'll cheer you up," Genma advised.</p><p>Ranma looked up from her own  sorrow and saw her father for who he truly was: a misguided, greedy, and lazy  man, but he was not a monster. He was a sad man. "I..."</p><p>"Or maybe you need to  talk to your mother." Genma sighed. That was a chasm he could never cross.  He wanted to help her, but he had no idea how to comfort her or express it, but  he knew someone who did.</p><p>"Thanks," Ranma  smiled weakly. "If my girls wake up, tell them I just went to see  Mom."</p><p>Genma nodded and looked back  to his bottle.</p><p>"Good luck with the  Master," Ranma pulled out a phone and called up an escort. She was in no mood  to fly.</p><p>Shortly, a group of Company  vans arrived Ranma eased into one. Thankfully the agent sitting next to her did  not try to make small talk. Ranma supposed they already knew, she forgot that  her shadowy glower made her even more unapproachable.</p><p>The van pulled into the  underground garage above the WIC base and Ranma stepped out. She silently  walked through the security checkpoints and made her way to the elevators.</p><p>Ranma leaned on the back of  the elevator and closed her eye as it descended into the earth. The doors  opened and she meandered through the corridors. She followed the route without  thought.</p><p>The door to the lab was open  and Nodoka looked up from the monitor as soon as she heard footsteps. While  superfluous, it was positive that Genma had called himself. The scientist got  up and before she could cross the room was embraced by her daughter.</p><p>"Kasumi?" Nodoka  gently asked the sobbing redhead.</p><p>Ranma nodded and leaned into  her mother's embrace.</p><p>"It'll be okay,"  Nodoka said as she eased the succubus back to a couch on the side of the lab.  They sat down and Ranma immediately rested her head on Nodoka. She held the  succubus and gently rocked her. Nodoka hugged her daughter tighter. Looking at  a brush on the table, she ran a hand through Ranma's deep and luscious hair.</p><p>After hearing her daughter's  crying lessen, Nodoka picked up the brush and went to work. She was surprised  to find the hair... responding to the brushing. Almost expectantly, it moved  into the brushing. Nodoka smiled and resumed the strokes.</p><p>End ch16</p><p>I'd like to thank my pre-readers. They're the ones that made  sure this story was readable. Trimatter, DGC, Questara, Solara, Kevin Hammel, J  St C Patrick, Pale Wolf, Wray, and Jerry Starfire.</p><p>Special thank Tri for his tenacity in improving the fight  scenes (the man was like a bulldog and did not let me be complacent or  "phone in" sub par scenes) and to J St C Patrick for  giving this his full attention even though he was very, very busy at work.</p><p>DGC(PyroRaven) deserves special attention  too. He's <i>always</i> been there and the time he puts into my work and tweaking  dialog and giving ideas cannot be understated.</p><p>Thanks to all of you for putting in the time  and effort in this for me. I'm humbled by the effort leveled towards a hobby of  mine.</p><p>Its wonderful to have a group like you  guys. You've been helping me fix my work  for years and I want to repeat how much that means to me. Means a lot to have that level of trust with  my ideas and the time you put into helping them.</p><p>To my main readers thank you guys for your reviewing. I've  always preferred quality over quantity and your comments simply are the best.  It's a great gauge for how the story is going and finding mistakes.</p>
