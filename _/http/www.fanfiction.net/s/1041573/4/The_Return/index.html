</div><p>Chapter 4 Reactions and Results</p><p>The ranking  youma looked at the monitors. He appeared to be an average, if rather tanned,  twenty-something male human. Dressed in a plain beige jumpsuit, he was sitting  at the observation chair for Furinkan High School's security system. Also in  the basement room were several similarly dressed entities. All were carrying  weapons of one sort or another.</p><p>The  situation was bad. The authorities had been alerted and sealed off the  building. This left them with only a couple dozen humans to work with. It was much  less than the several hundred they were expecting. The number was considerably  fewer people than youma. It was all that stupid teacher's fault. Dave shook his  head. Some of the blame could be placed on those two dead idiots who let their  guard down.</p><p>The  situation was not hopeless. They still had plenty of energy. He had many troops  and powerful weapons for them to use. He also had some humans. These would buy  him some time with the police. Already, the news reporters had arrived on the  scene. No doubt, the Senshi would find out about this and rush in "to save  the day."</p><p>Their ideal  plan required plenty of humans, but they could make do without them. Dave  smiled. Even if things went horribly wrong they still had an active gate. Thanks  to the gate retreat was still an option.</p><p>The  situation with those armed teachers was resolved as well. They had to kill the  one with the handgun that was wandering the halls. Somehow the fool had managed  to kill two more of his men before finally being put down. For the rest of the  teachers, all they had to do was gas the room, incapacitating them all. Dave  would have preferred to kill all of them for their insolence, but with a  limited supply of humans that was not an option.</p><p>Dave looked  at his watch. His second in command, who used the alias Frank, should be  arriving from his inspection of the troops in the upper floors. Once here Frank  could take over here. Dave really wished that he could have taken that  substitute teacher alive. It would have been nice to <i>talk </i>with the man responsible for this mess.</p><p>"So  that's your plan," Ranma stated. He then stood up and looked around the  room. They were in the briefing section of a Company mobile command center. A  large tractor trailer converted to this purpose, it was parked in a lot across  the street from the target building.</p><p>From his  seat, Jacob nodded. The boy seemed to be capable enough. Ranma seemed more  interested in learning what the Company was doing than telling Jacob what he  planned to do. The agent was pleased that the boy was showing that much caution.  He almost expected Ranma to blindly run into the building the second he arrived.  Instead he asked about what the Company was doing and where the insertion  points were.</p><p>The  situation was amusing in a twisted way. Jacob had just explained an entire  operation to known Pattern D. "Good luck," the old agent finally said  to the young man.</p><p>Ranma gave  a curt nod and stretched a bit. He hated what he had to do, but there was no  choice. His character told him that he had to fight, and it would be complete  idiocy to not use a very powerful advantage. Ranma's form wavered and shifted  into his female form. Bands of crimson, violet, and black energy then wrapped  around her body. Pattern scanners in the room recorded the transformation.</p><p>The lights  quickly died down and revealed the changes. The woman was an exceedingly beautiful,  alabaster-skinned, demoness complete with fangs, little black horns, large  wings that were dark purple on the outside and blood red on the inside, and a  long red tail with purple spade shaped fins at the end. She was dressed in a  parody of a Senshi uniform, itself a parody of a school girl's uniform.</p><p>She wore  black leather knee-high boots with a five inch-heel and a black leather, red  trimmed pleated skirt. Her top was composed of purple and red ribbons with  bikini-like panels over her generous chest. Like her dangling earrings, her  gold tiara was set with a single stone of pure obsidian darkness.</p><p>Her hair  now reached mid-back and was the deep red color of arterial blood. It was  feathered and had purple highlights. Her fingernails had lengthened until they  resembled crimson talons. Her makeup was slightly more elaborate than the  normal for a Senshi, and meshed very well with her eyes, which were now a very  deep, almost luminescent amethyst.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar folded her wings tight against her back. She then shook her head. Her  hair swished back and forth. Jacob's face was carefully neutral as watched the  display. He had seen the footage from the assassination attempt, but to see the  transformation in person was something else entirely.</p><p>Jacob then  turned to one of the computer operators. "Agent Iverson, show the communications  equipment to- what name do you want to use for this?" Jacob asked the  demonic magical girl.</p><p>"DarkStar's  fine, I guess," the redhead said, her violet eyes starting to glow  slightly.</p><p>Maya  Iverson stood up. Dressed in combat gear similar to the other agents, she had  dark brown hair that was cut to just above her neck. She had picked up a small object.  She walked over to DarkStar. She stood before a girl that even without her  heels was a couple inches taller than her. Iverson handed the device to the  pseudo-Senshi.</p><p>"This  is a Mark 302 communications system," the brunette said in a surprisingly cheerful  voice that was oddly familiar to DarkStar. "It clips onto your ear like  so. Just make sure that it clasps properly or it will cause some discomfort,"  the young woman said as she demonstrated the mechanism on her own headset.</p><p>DarkStar  looked at the device in her hands. There was no real reason not to wear the  damn thing. It was easy enough to take off. She had pulled back some of her  crimson tresses and was prepared to clip the headset into place. She looked at  Jacob's carefully neutral face and paused. This was too much. This was exactly  what <i>they</i> wanted. She was being far  too accommodating to these fools. "I can't take this," she stated as  she handed the headset back to the young woman.</p><p>"That's  fine," Jacob said dismissively.</p><p>DarkStar  went to the back door of the room. The armored door opened and she walked  through.</p><p>Stillwater  sat in the central chair of WIC Toronto-A's Command and Control Center. His  elbows were placed on the table in front of him. Save for his index fingers,  the Commander's digits were linked past each other. Those two other fingers  were extended and rested on the bridge of his nose.</p><p>"Are all  the pieces in place?" he asked.</p><p>"Yes sir,  everyone is ready. The cryptographic team has recovered from their delay,"  one of the C3 officers responded. "They are ready-" he paused for a  few seconds then spoke again as a few symbols changed on his display. "-now."</p><p>"Excellent,"  Stillwater said, putting his hands down. It had taken some doing for the  software experts in Communications and Cryptography Section to get in. Having access  to Keystone Security's files did help speed things. He then picked up a black  phone that sat on the table. "All teams are Go. I repeat Go," he said  in a clear cold voice.</p><p>The power  lines that serviced Furinkan were disconnected by Company personnel that had  accessed a telephone pole outside of the quarantine zone. Most of the phone  lines were disabled as well. Those that the cryptography team required were  left intact. At the same time cellular phone service for the area was disabled  by a few timely commands to local transmitter towers.</p><p>The youma  monitoring the school's security system watched the power fail. He waited for  the backup system to kick in. The emergency lights had kicked on, but the  security monitors remained blank. The monster quizzically looked at the black  screens, unaware that the computers controlling the system had been  compromised.</p><p>Inside  several of the larger Company vehicles were some large, complicated machines. They  were being activated by the agents that operated them. A few gritted their  teeth as machines powered up. The fields they generated were supposedly imperceptible.  However, some of the more experienced operators could feel a strange resonance  that was reminiscent of how air feels right before a lightning strike.</p><p>Dave rubbed  his forehead. He should have known that the police would try to cut the  building's phone and power. He reminded himself to punish the head of Cell 4. That  idiot had assured him that the security system had been repaired and would  still function in the event of blackout.</p><p>The youma  leader was in the storage room that their gate was stored in. He was watching  as two members of Cell 1 carried a large crate across the threshold of the  portal. Dave watched as the swirling, almost invisible curtain that marked the  gateway between the two locations intensified in brightness before  extinguishing completely.</p><p>The gateway  failed. The crate fell to the ground. The youma carrying it from behind was unable  to hold it up as he was missing everything from the left side of his neck to  his left foot, except for part of his left arm that had fallen off the crate.</p><p>Dave  watched as the body slowly dissolved. All their time living as humans had given  their bodies a bit more substance. This made their corpses much messier. "I  want the gate back up and running," he told the youma in charge of the  gateway in a very quiet dangerous voice.</p><p>The youma  quickly agreed and stated that the gate failure was probably due to  interference from the energy cells or something.</p><p>Dave then  turned to his second. "Alert everyone," he ordered Frank. "Ask  our rooftop observers if those police have done anything."</p><p>Frank had sent  three members of Cell 2 up onto the roof. One was in the center on the fifth  floor roof, and the other two were on the third floor roof and opposite ends of  the H-shaped building.</p><p>The  observers had been using a spell that gave them a fair degree of invisibility  and another for protection. Unfortunately for them they were not thermally or  magically stealthed. Dressed in their own specialized Ghillie Suits, the  Company sharpshooters found Frank's observers rather easily.  Unlike the two Pattern Ys dispatched by Agent  Samuel Chase these creatures had their protective fields up. It would prove to  be insufficient protection.</p><p>The  sharpshooters were using Model S03 ammunition, more commonly known among  Company personnel as Lead Flowers. These projectiles consist of two sections. Under  a thin coating designed to prevent jamming were six metal segments. When the  rotating slug hit a barrier these pieces of metal bent out revealing a  high-density sabot-style dart at the core of the slug. The six high strength  metal petals then drilled into the obstruction allowing the core to pass  through.</p><p>The  sharpshooters fired. The bullets hit the youma shields. For only instant, a  section of the youma shields the size of a small nail failed, but it was  enough.</p><p>The sabot  core of the bullet separated from the outer sections and closed the remaining  handful of inches. There the sabots hit the youma and blasted a surprisingly  large cone of organic fragments out of the side opposite the sharpshooter. The  other two youma met identical fates. The kills were confirmed, and the  operation's next sequence activated.</p><p>From the  shadows in a grove of trees near the athletic fields DarkStar watched as the  armored vehicles and helicopters moved in. She had listened to Jacob because  she wanted to know what the Company's plans were. Where they would be putting  men, where the hostages were, and where they would be setting the explosives.</p><p>She now  knew all that and made her own plan. Jacob seemed oddly cooperative. DarkStar  cleared those thoughts from her mind and spread her wings. She had WIC's  information and what she had observed in the few minutes she had waited for the  Company to make its move.</p><p>She had let  her demonic senses fold out causing a strange doubling with her more mundane  senses. She could still see the visible light reflecting off of the building,  but she could also see the energy signatures of the creatures within. It was  like watching candles stacked on the other side of a sheet. She could tell  their location and their <i>brightness</i>  but not much else. The demon knew that if she were close she would be able to  sense the energy signatures of the enemy. It would come in complex, almost  aromatic, bundles of information.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar felt the waves of electromagnetic radiation cascading over her. The  distortions caused by magnetic and electric fields from surrounding electronics  caused considerable white noise, with more intense bursts coming from powerful  devices. Of particular note was a large pulse coming from the basement of the  school. Although it stopped the second the Company powered up some strangely-intense  machines.</p><p>As Company  agents stormed the building, DarkStar took to the air. She flew low and fast,  right into a third story window. Her wings folded in and she tumbled through  the large window. She smoothly landed behind a desk, her knees bent and her  tail extended behind her for balance.</p><p>She then  saw four knotted signatures walking down the hallway, towards the classroom she  was in. Soon, she could smell them. They were youma, fairly weak, some shielding,  and there was something else, something concentrated that they were carrying.  She edged to one side of the room and waited for them to get through the  doorway.</p><p>A youma  entered the room, his Kalashnikov raised to his shoulder.        The creature was nervous; there had been  a crash in the ground floor followed by gunfire. There was also something going  on with that helicopter that had passed overhead. He noticed the broken window  first, his eyes scanning the room. Confusion drew on his face as he saw the  girl. She was wearing the uniform of the enemy but she was obviously something  else.</p><p>DarkStar  saw the man raise his weapon, finger on the trigger, and charged her own attack  to counter. A violet orb wreathed in white flames appeared in her hand before  being propelled at the youma. After passing though his shield with the all ease  of a match through tissue paper, the orb then slammed into the youma hard, covering  him in a goop that stuck to his body and ignited instantly. The youma died  quickly as the flames consumed his body, and DarkStar slowly walked over the  charred smear on the floor, towards the door.</p><p>"What  the hell happened to Earl?" a frightened voice asked from outside in the  hall.</p><p>"Cover  me, I'm going in," another voice, this one much closer to the door,  stated. He slipped into the room keeping his back to the wall.</p><p>He almost  ran into the tall redhead, who quickly eviscerated him. Partially-translucent  red claws had appeared on her fingers. They extended several inches beyond the  tips of her fingers and sliced through the youma's body with little resistance.</p><p>DarkStar  ran into the doorway and quickly shot two spheres of magical napalm. One hit a  youma right in the head, instantly killing him. The other struck the last  member of the squad in the left hip, only splashing part of his body in the  adhesive incendiary. Before DarkStar could grab the youma and get him with her  claws, he managed to squeeze off three low shots that embedded themselves into  the floor. They were the only shots fired by this group.</p><p>DarkStar  dropped the youma. A wave off coldness had covered her. She looked at the  corpses. One was nothing more than a smear on the tile floor. Two were cut into  rapidly decaying chunks of flesh. The last one was slumped against some lockers,  the remains of his head and shoulders still burning like some horrific candle.</p><p>She  withdrew her power and the flames snuffed out. At least they stopped looking  human once they died. DarkStar knew those shots would attract some attention. She  sensed another group coming in from somewhere else in the building.</p><p>Kasumi  crouched on the fifth floor roof her team had just rappelled onto. Their boots had  just softly touched the tarred gravel that made up its surface. The access  hatch to the roof was open and a concerned voice was calling up from below. "Irving,  what's going on?</p><p>She turned  to Gabriel. Her left hand made a series of gestures before returning to her  weapon. Behind his red goggles Gabriel's eyes narrowed. He unclipped a grenade  and readied it. Sophie and Aram slowly moved towards the hatch. Their footsteps  were surprisingly silent considering their boots and the gravel surface.</p><p>"That  helicopter sounded awfully close," the youma said, oblivious to the  situation.</p><p>Gabriel  released the grenade's spoon, held it for a second and a half, and neatly  lobbed it through the hatch.</p><p>"Look,  I'm coming up there," the youma said as he gripped the ladder that was  bolted to the wall. He saw the green canister neatly fall towards him. It detonated  roughly even with his head. The youma's body above the hips disappeared in the  blast.</p><p>Aram waited  a second before he jumped through the hatch. Sophie followed a few seconds  later. They found themselves in the remains of a janitor's closet, and Aram  found himself up to his ankles in the rotting remains of the youma. The soldier  grunted at this, glad that his boots were thick and high enough for the job.</p><p>The  concussion and shrapnel from the blast had destroyed the room. Several  containers of cleaning supplies had ruptured. The chemical smell mixed  unpleasantly with the stench of burnt meat and hair that emanated from the  remains splattered all over the walls of the small room.</p><p>Sophie made  her way to the door. A series of characters and a small image was being  projected onto a corner of her goggles. She motioned for Aram to take position  next to the door near the knob.</p><p>Sophie  listened, waited, and fired. She depressed the trigger to her weapon, releasing  two three round bursts at spots indicated by her pattern scanner. The sound was  suppressed quite effectively. The gun only gave off a slight, metallic brushing  sound.</p><p>Aram then tore  the door open ready to fire his gun. Aram had a 20mm grenade round chambered in  his weapon. Both agents were carrying the same model gun.</p><p>The weapons  Kasumi's team carried were rather unique. While having only one trigger guard  and trigger, the weapons had two barrels, actions, magazine receivers, and  magazines. The gun looked like a futuristic merging of a shotgun and an assault  rifle. These weapons are quite similar to the Objective Individual Combat  Weapon (OICW) being developed by the US military. The most notable changes are the  use of specialized 7.62mm ammunition in the Company version as opposed to the  5.56mm of the US military version for the lower and forward assembly of barrel,  action, and magazine, and an increased length of the barrels on this version. Company  scientists found a larger bore diameter more conducive to specialized  cartridges.  Despite the use of lightweight,  and high-strength. composites in the stock and other applicable locations,  excessive weight is still an issue with this weapon.</p><p>Aram found  the hallway empty save for two more decomposing Pattern Ys. Aram was relived to  find that the Model 703, a Company enhanced version of the US Army M993 armor  piercing 7.62mm cartridge, was sufficient. He motioned for Sophie to exit the  room and sent the signal for Gabriel and Kasumi to come in from the roof. They  had to clear the floor before proceeding downward.</p><p>The leader  of Cell 6 groaned slightly. He had just told Frank the situation. All personnel  on the fifth and third floors had failed to report in. An explosion had been  heard from above and some gunshots had been heard below. Frank's response was  particularly abrasive. His troops had been hit by these human as well, and they  were being held back.</p><p>Frank told  the subordinate youma that the forces at his disposal were more than adequate  to eliminate the intruders. Cell 6's leader was expected to kill those  interfering fools and then move to the ground floor. With that statement, Frank  disconnected up. The entire transmission had an annoying distortion to it, a  stretchy reverb with maddening static.</p><p>The youma  split his forces and gave his orders.</p><p>DarkStar  heard and sensed the larger contingent of youma moving down the stairs towards  her floor. She detected eight youma with the empowered ammunition that meant  rifles, three with tubes that swirled with dark energy, two that were carrying  something large and bulky - most likely a machinegun of some sort- and one that  had something strapped to his back that connected to an object in his hands.</p><p>She waited  for their point to reach the landing.</p><p>A particularly  tall youma lead his squad down the stairs. He was in front with two other  riflemen on either side with a bazooka-man in the back. He cautiously moved  forward. He thought he saw something moving in the shadows of the hallway in  front of him. Cursing the blackout, he put a bit more pressure on his trigger  and stepped forward.</p><p>Suddenly a  red, black, and violet blur propelled itself towards him.</p><p>DarkStar  surged at the forward knot of youma. As she slit the throat of the youma on the  left, his finger spasmed on the trigger. The demon was quick to turn the gun  towards the one in the center. She smiled as the bullets tore unusually large  holes in the monster's body. Blasts of napalm turned the remaining two members  of the squad into screaming hunks of burning meat.</p><p>She jumped  up to the landing that sat in between the floors, and inside the middle group  of youma. A series of filaments shot  out of the spade-shaped fins on the tip of her long tail. <i>Now comes the fun stuff</i>, DarkStar thought as she tore into the  surprised entities.</p><p>"Open  fire!" the ranking youma in the rear group ordered as he watched the  massacre. There were five men in that squad, three with Kalashnikovs, one with  a bazooka, and one with a machinegun, but they might as well have had nothing. The  girl spun around in an intricate movement, breaking legs and arms with her  heavy boots and indiscriminately slicing through limbs, necks, and weapons with  her claws. Her tail was like a hybrid of a chainsaw and a mace, whatever it  touched with those squirming razor-sharp filaments was reduced to a ground,  shredded slurry.</p><p>The last  group was too late. DarkStar had finished with the middle group and was moving  forward. Some of them actually managed to fire. It was panicky, uncontrolled,  and hardly aimed. The red-headed demon found the limited fire easy to evade. Those  that did shoot earned a drenching in her enhanced napalm for their troubles. DarkStar  made quick work of the remains of the team.</p><p>The demonic  magical girl paused to catch her breath. She had killed fourteen youma in roughly  forty seconds.</p><p>As Gabriel and Kasumi finished  clearing the fifth floor rooms, Aram had heard the enemy coming up the South  stairs. Aram had waited for them to round the corner at the half floor landing  before firing a 20mm fragmentary cartridge. The three of Pattern Ys quickly  disintegrated in the blast. The four behind them were disoriented, wounded, and  easily dispatched with another blast.</p><p>Sophie was  at the North stairwell where oddly there was not a secondary attack. The youma  paused just around the corner of the South stairs, hiding behind the concrete  wall that separated the two ends of the stairway. Kasumi came up to support  Aram, while Gabriel went to, the North stairwell, and joined Sophie as they waited  for a flanking attack that never came.</p><p>Kasumi  motioned for Aram to quiet down. The woman listened then smiled. These  creatures were pathetically noisy and disorganized. She pulled out a grenade  and removed the pin. She gauged the distance and then tossed the explosive. It  hit on the wall above the landing and bounced down the stairs. It exploded in  the midst of the youma.</p><p>The sounds  of screams, explosions, falling bodies, and sporadic gunfire echoed up from the  stairs that Sophie and Gabriel were positioned at. Sophie's pattern scanner did  not have the power of Gabriel's larger and heavier model and thus only he was  able to pick up what had happened. Bellow them, around a dozen weak signals of  Pattern Y of high probability were eliminated by a strong signal of Pattern D and  Silver of moderate probability.</p><p>"We  may have found DarkStar. North stairwell third or forth floor." Gabriel  said into his headset. It was the first words that any of them had uttered  since landing on the roof. "Understood," he and Sophie said as they received  their orders. The two agents then made their way down the stairs.</p><p>The demon  looked up from her position just at the forth floor landing. Two humans slowly  walked down the stairs. They paused just above the middle bend in the stairwell.</p><p>"DarkStar!"  one of them stated in a clear, yet quiet, voice.</p><p>"Yeah?"  she replied, walking forward a bit.</p><p>"Confirmed,"  said the other one. Then they both rounded the corner. The maneuver was quick,  professional, and allowed both of them to maintain clear lines of fire during  the entirety of it.</p><p>DarkStar  once again found herself facing down Company agents with guns. They still had  the blocky assault rifles. Although now they appeared to have another much  larger barrel assembly attached on the top of their guns. They were in the same  dark grey and green camouflaged body armor, that she had watched Kasumi put on.  Their goggles were now pulled down over their eyes. Their helmets extended down  to cover their ears and the back of their heads, and the strangely luminescent  goggles sat snugly in place. The only exposed skin they had was a bit of mouth  that ran from above the chin to below the nose, not including the headset  microphone. DarkStar could also see gas masks clipped onto their harnesses that  would complete the skin coverage.</p><p>The demon  watched as they approached. Their guns were no longer aimed at her, instead  they were low and to the side. They walked up to her and then passed her. The  one that was female motioned for DarkStar to follow. The demon could tell her  gender by both her scent and how the armor fit her body.</p><p>Gabriel  managed to keep his face neutral. He was quite relieved that the demon was on  their side, or at least not their enemy. She might be in a miniskirt and heels,  wearing makeup and jewelry, and showing a lot of cleavage, but she was also a  demon. The horns, fangs, wings, and tail made that rather clear. Gabriel  imagined that the girl would be drenched in blood if not for the accelerated  decomposition of the enemy.</p><p>The solider  pushed those thoughts aside. He covered Sophie as she peered into the forth  floor hallway. At the other end Sophie could see the group of Pattern Ys that  Aram and Kasumi were engaging. She clicked her headset two times. After  receiving the one click reply, she and Gabriel moved into the hallway and each fired  twice. The explosions of the four grenade rounds in the South stairwell was  quickly followed by two more coming from Kasumi and Aram.</p><p>Sophie  moved her selector switch to 7.62mm three round burst, and watched for  movement. After seeing none she and Gabriel moved in. They found the jumbled  mushy remains of over a dozen youma pilled in and around the stairwell. Twisted  bits of metal that were once weapons were scattered over the goop like nuts  over pudding.</p><p>The 20mm  grenade rounds had also caused some structural damage to the concrete walls and  steps. There would have been more if not for having most of the kinetic energy  absorbed by the youma's shields and then their bodies.</p><p>Kasumi and  Aram made their way down the cracked, stained, and organic covered steps. Aram  shook his head as his boots got covered in gore once again. Kasumi simply  walked through the obstacle as if it were a bank of snow or some thick mud.</p><p>DarkStar  watched as the four Company agents checked the all the rooms in the floor. Her  own senses could not detect anything else on the floor, and she imagined that  their pattern recognition devices were similarly blank. Despite this they still  swept the entire floor. "Floors five, four clean. Have met with DarkStar. Proceeding  with next stage," Kasumi spoke into her headset after they had finished.</p><p>Dave looked  at his second, Frank. He then gave his order. The situation was grim. They had  just lost contact with the personnel guarding the hostages in the cafeteria. It  happened shortly after all the teams in the third, forth, and fifth floors had  fallen silent. They were the last group outside of the basement to fall.</p><p>Now it was  just them. Dave would not have been so worried if they could get the gate  working again, but nothing seemed to work. None of them had the power to  teleport without one. They were trapped.</p><p>Currently  they were able to defend their position, but their lines of defense were  rapidly failing. Ten minutes ago the humans were just charging at the basement  stairs. Five minutes ago they broke through the youma line at a hallway  juncture. Now they were at the last line of defense.</p><p>What should  have been impenetrable barriers, bristling with deadly weapons, and clear killing  zones were only minor obstacles to these mysterious foes. Shields that had been  carefully designed to protect against magical attacks and normal police weapons  were frustratingly inadequate against whatever <i>these</i> humans were using.</p><p>Dave could  hear the sounds of battle grow closer. That last line was being pounded by what  sounded like a constant buzz of small arms fire, punctuated by several small  and large explosions. Dave could hear the muted sounds of his troops being  killed and cringed. Not in sympathy for those he was responsible for, but out  of fear of his life and fear of failure.</p><p>Dave made  sure that the door to the gate room was locked and shielded with their  remaining energy. He knew that the humans would eventually get in, and that  this would only delay the inevitable.</p><p>Frank  nodded in agreement. There was nothing else they could do. Might as well take  out as many of those humans as possible. It was the most they could do. The  hated Senshi had not even bothered to show up.</p><p>Usagi  looked at the school from behind the police tape. She and her friends had  walked to the school and had found the building quarantined. The blonde had  also noticed the military vehicles and people dressed in combat gear. While  there were no logos or identifying marks on them, it was obvious who these  people were. They were agents of Willard International Consulting, the  organization that Setsuna had warned them about.</p><p>Rei could  sense the dark energy inside the building. Ami's computer could also pick up  the disturbance and could narrow down what kind of enemy was in the school -youma.  No one in the group needed to be told what they were doing in the school. It  was obviously a trap.</p><p>"They  had to have been watching the school to have known they were here," Minako  observed.</p><p>"They  might be watching us too." Makoto said as she looked at the WIC soldiers  that manned the Humvees that were intermingled with the police cruisers. The  eyes of the personnel constantly scanned the crowd but kept returning to those  five girls. Makoto did not think she was being overly paranoid.</p><p>"What  I want to know is, why youma? We killed them all." Usagi said as she looked  at the building. Occasionally one of the windows would light up in a brief  flash or extended collection of flashes.</p><p>"Maybe  they were trapped somewhere or waiting for some reason," Rei shrugged.</p><p>"Should we go-"</p><p>"No,"  Usagi said.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"It's  almost over.  By the time we got in  they'd be done.  Besides something's not  right here, and I don't mean the youma. There's something more going on  here."</p><p>"DarkStar?"  Makoto asked.</p><p>"Murdock?"  Ami inquired.</p><p>"Yes,"  Usagi replied to both questions.</p><p>"They're  both here?" Ami asked as she looked around. Her eyes found Janet Fraiser,  the other new girl in her and Minako's class. The auburn-haired girl looked at  the school shrugged and turned away, pausing only to give a small wave to Ami.</p><p>Janet then  walked away from the school. She disliked crowds. The girl found being lost in  a sea of humanity to be quite claustrophobic. She stopped herself from bumping  into Rod Ferris, another new transfer student. What was a rather handsome face  was soured by an expression that, while subtle, was rather disturbing.</p><p>Ami watched  Janet nearly bump into that other new kid Ferris. There was something about him  that upset Ami. And Janet too it seemed. The girl glared at Rod before walking  away.</p><p>"Oh  God, it's that creep Ferris," Rei said as the turned to what Ami was  watching.</p><p>"For  such a handsome guy he's got something <i>wrong</i>  with him," Minako said relived, that they had something other than the  school to look at.</p><p>"That's  the problem. He knows he's good looking. And he uses that as a weapon,"  Usagi said in an eerily cold voice.</p><p>By now, Rod  had noticed the girls staring at him. His eyes twinkled, and he gave a knowing  smile. The teen then gave a strange little gesture that was part the forked  fingers of the evil eye and part military salute. Ferris then chuckled and  disappeared back into the crowd.</p><p>Setsuna  watched Rod walk away. She was looking out the window of an empty forth story office  in a commercial building to the South of Furinkan. Her red eyes were looking  into a powerful set of binoculars. The green-haired woman's face darkened as  she watched the dusky teen and the auburn-haired girl.</p><p>Questions  came at the Time Guardian. Why now? Why youma? Was this all a plot to get  DarkStar to work with WIC? She had only vague notions of what Murdock was  doing, let alone what he was planning.</p><p><i>He's playing with them. </i>She thought as  she replayed the meeting of Janet and Rod. Setsuna had seen something,  something familiar. Then it hit her. <i>Would  he do something like that?</i> <i>Yes. If it  suited his plans he would.</i> She thought carefully.After all, the Senshi now know what Murdock looks like and what he  had done. A new face would make him more palatable.</p><p>Hikaru  Gosunkugi watched the school with a worried expression on his face. He sighed  and turned away, ready to return home. He would watch the news and try to  decipher what was active media bias, passive media ignorance, and organized  disinformation.</p><p>He left the  crowd behind and started walking down the street. Before he could get very far,  he nearly ran into one of his fellow students. It was that other new guy, Rod Ferris.  The teen had an amused and somewhat smug expression on his face. Hikaru  supposed that Rod found his little trick quite entertaining. He mumbled some  vague pleasantry and tried to walk away.</p><p>"You  bring that book?" Rod asked, ignoring what Hikaru said.</p><p>"What  book?"</p><p>"Oh  you know, that ancient tome you've been translating."</p><p>"Ahh,"  Gosunkugi said. He had made no attempt at hiding the book. He had to get the  job done a certain way. Disobedience was not something he was willing to  entertain the thought of. It carried far too high a price.</p><p>"It's  funny. There are very few who can even read, let alone translate such a text. One  wonders what someone with your linguistic skills is doing here." Rod's  smile grew. Several of his gleaming, white teeth were now exposed.</p><p>"Where  are you getting at?" Hikaru asked. His face was carefully neutral.</p><p>"Let's  just say there are certain associates of mine that wish to talk with the <i>people</i> that you work for," Rod  stated, his tone rolling on the word people.</p><p>"Oh? Is  that all? I'd be more than happy to relay that to that particular group,"  Hikaru said with some amusement. He thought he saw surprise on Rod's face, but  it was only there for an instant.</p><p>"Excellent,"  Ferris said as he left.</p><p>Kasumi  loaded a fresh . She was currently firing high explosive incendiary  (HEI). The rest of her team were using armor piercing incendiary. Traveling  with DarkStar, they made their way to the ground floor to reinforce the assault  on the basement stronghold.</p><p>The M60  gunners were watching the head of the basement stairs from an oblique position.  The air was heavy with burnt powder and the smell of something chemical and  metallic. The alert had gone out and all Company agents donned their gas masks.</p><p>Grenades  were then lobbed down the stairs. Only some of them were fragmentary or  concussive. Most of them were tear gas and smoke. Company agents then charged  at the head of the stairs. Their sensor systems allowed them to see through the  gas and they fired several volleys of 20mm HEI at the Youma defensive barrier  before pulling back.</p><p>By now the  two M60's had been moved. It was a straight shot to the youma position at the  base of the stairs. The youma's shield generators had been overloaded by the  initial round of 20mm shells. This enabled the next waves of HEI to hit their  targets unobstructed.</p><p>It was into  this confused, wounded, and dying mass that the two machine gunners immediately  opened fire on. They had Model 723 7.62mm ammunition in their guns. It was  halfway between the immense Lead Flower used by sharpshooters and the almost  mundane Model 703 armor piercing.</p><p>The two  gunners moved their sights over the enemy, looking for targets that were still  viable. Finding none they stopped firing. Eight Company agents then went down  the stairs to secure the area. The two M60's were then moved to this new  position. Kasumi's squad and another then went out to find the next youma  formation.</p><p>As usual,  Tatewaki Kuno had gone to school with his father. This allowed him to get in  before his beloved Sunshine Saotome and Akane Tendo. Things had been proceeding  normally, until they came.</p><p>Kuno was rounded up and placed in the  cafeteria with the others. He noticed that the vile beasts had not frisked him,  nor were they even watching him closely. It was then that Kuno came knew what  he had to do.</p><p>The hostage  operation was proceeding within acceptable limits. The cafeteria had been  sealed off, and the agents were just about to strike when it happened. One of  the hostages, a young man, he appeared to be the only student, shouted  something and attacked one of the youma.</p><p>He had  pulled a large boot knife out from a leg sheath and had jumped one of the Pattern  Ys. The shield resisted the blade, but the teen eventually forced it through  and stabbed between the ribs, piercing the youma's heart. Unfortunately the  delay gave the youma enough time to shoot the boy.</p><p>The Company  agent-in-charge used this opportunity and gave the go code. They remaining  guards were killed in a firefight that while brief, was not as clean as hoped. One  of the agents that charged through the west door took a round in the chest and a  grazing one in the arm. He also felt the <i>wind</i>  from several rounds pass by him.</p><p>With the youma killed and the room  secure, the call for medics went out. Two Company medics came into the room. One  went to the agent and was relieved that his armor had protected him. Even with  the advanced materials in their protective armor, stopping a rifle bullet was  tricky business, especially at this range. The agent had considerable bruising,  several broken ribs, a sprained knee, and a fracture in his arm, but he would  live. The same could not be said for the teen. He had been gut-shot. If it was  a normal bullet they might have had a chance. After all, they did have the  helicopters to Medivac him out.</p><p>But the  youma were not using normal rounds. They had been enhanced with certain  energies. The medic's eyes could see the boy slipping away, and his pattern  scanner could detect the bullet. The medic then talked into her headset. The  doctor might be able to help.</p><p>Section  Chief, Doctor Tofu Ono was surprised by the call in his headset. As he led his  team into the building, he chastised himself for being caught off guard. It was  rather likely that he would be called in before the shooting was over. There was  always a chance of getting wounded.</p><p>The demonic  Senshi allowed a small smile to form on her face. She had originally planned on  watching the Company eliminate this defensive position just like the other two,  but she had changed her mind. She had softened the target a bit using her own  ranged attack.</p><p>In high  numbers and in a closed space, the splash damage was quite impressive. The orbs  were flung high and low, and were large and small. Soon the youma were trapped by  a crawling barrier of white and violet flames.</p><p>Returning  fire was not an option for the youma in the front. Their weapons had melted  onto their arms and hands. Their ammunition started to ignite, turning their  weapons into crude grenades that did further damage.</p><p>The  shrieking monsters were then pushed back. Their combusting bodies fell on the  line behind them. Once again the youma lines had broken. The cowering monsters  found themselves being covered in the flaming liquid.</p><p>DarkStar's  eyes flared as she felt the last of the defenders die. Her flames, having  nothing interesting left to consume, stopped. The magical girl looked down the  corridor. Two burning orbs were being held in her hands. The hallway ended with  a metal door. Its edges glowed slightly. She made the two balls of napalm  vanish. As she walked forward, her eyes scanned the burned bodies piled in the  end surprisingly wide hallway.</p><p>Kasumi  walked up behind her. DarkStar could hear that someone was talking to her through  the girl's headset. "Understood," Lieutenant Tendo stated into her  microphone. "DarkStar."</p><p>The redhead  turned to face the Company agent.</p><p>"Nice  going there." Kasumi said with genuine admiration. The girl had the power  and the self control to use it well. "Inside is the last of them. You want  'em?"</p><p>DarkStar  shrugged. Then she nodded.</p><p>"Okay,  we'll open the door for you," Kasumi said as she waved some agents over to  her. One was Steven Deschain, a demolitions specialist. Deschain inspected the  door and took some readings. Like most doors, this one opened into the room. From  behind his matte-black gasmask, Deschain smiled. The door could be bypassed  easily enough. "Breaching rounds," he said pointing to the door's  hinges and deadbolt lock.</p><p>Gabriel  pulled a single 20mm cartridge out of a pocket, that until now still had it's  original four, and loaded it in his weapon. The round had a relatively thin  copper jacket that upon impact would peel back revealing a heavy zinc core. He  then moved off to the side while pointing the upper muzzle of his gun at the  lower hinge. Three other agents put in identical loads and took similar  positions.</p><p>Deschain  then secured a small black device on the middle of the door. Stenciled on the  flat side that was stuck to the door were the words "Front Toward  Enemy". Similar in concept to the jammers used by the Company, this object  was a Model E53 Burst Disruptor. The device charged a very powerful capacitor  that released a specifically patterned burst of energy designed to weaken and  destroy energy shields.</p><p>Deschain  then wired a detonator to the device and backed away and to the side. He gave a  nod to Kasumi. "Go?"</p><p>DarkStar  looked at the door. She could see the shield and had a fair idea as to what  Deschain's device would do to it. The Agents would blow out the hinges and  locks and that machine would disable the shield. DarkStar supposed that if she  hit the door in the right place... Yes that would work. There was only one  thing missing. "Take out the lights," the redhead said as she pointed  to the battery-powered emergency lights, some of which were still functioning.</p><p>Kasumi  nodded and positioned agents to take out the remaining lights. "What about  the lights inside the room?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"I'll  handle it," DarkStar said as she walked down the hall. She turned and  looked at the door. The wires on the device were tucked out of the way. The  guns were in position and not a problem.</p><p>DarkStar  inhaled and sprinted towards the door. As she leapt up, Deschain detonated the  device and the Company agents fired their weapons. The redhead's high-heeled  boots slammed into the metal door. Without anything to keep it in the jamb and  the majority of the redhead's force above its center of gravity, the door  tipped over and skidded back.</p><p>Sailor DarkStar  found herself standing on the door in the middle of a storage room. The youma  in the room found themselves plunged into darkness. The emergency lights in the  hallway were shot out, and DarkStar had released a number of small spheres  destroying the room's emergency light and a few monitors and stationary lamps  that had been hooked up to a generator.</p><p>"Fire!"  Frank shouted and shot his gun at where he thought the intruder was. After  firing a burst, he reached for the remote control in his pocket. Now was the  time. It looked like he would be able to kill one Senshi at the very least.</p><p>DarkStar  had turned to the youma that had given the order. She saw him pull out  something and reacted instantly. Two orbs of napalm amputated, rather messily, his  arms at the elbows. The demon then closed in and turned around, grazing the  youma's chest with her tail. The filaments sliced several of Frank's organs  into irregularly shaped chunks. Mortally wounded, the creature slumped to the  floor.</p><p>The demon  was working on her next targets. The youma were firing blindly and were easily  destroyed. Quickly it was down to two left. One was disemboweled just above the  hips to the spine with DarkStar's claws while simultaneously the other found  her head diced by the redhead's tail.</p><p>DarkStar  stopped and looked around the room. Everyone was dead. Several Company agents  then entered the room. The night vision systems being projected on their  goggles allowed them to see the interior of the room. Sophie found the control  in the remains of Frank's hands and showed it to Deschain.</p><p>Kasumi  finished the inspection and called the C3. "All targets have been  dispatched. I repeat. All targets have been dispatched. Securing the area. Request  Forensic Pathology section. Really? He's already here. Understood," Kasumi  said into her headset while talking with Stillwater.</p><p>"Interesting,"  Deschain said looking at the inactive gateway leaning on one wall. "We'll  need some people from S and T here too," the demolitions expert said  referring to Science and Technology section.</p><p>DarkStar  shook her head as she looked around the room. Scattered on the floor were half  a dozen piles of rapidly decaying organic matter. She took a few breaths. The  redhead could sense that the building had been cleared of nonhuman entities,  excluding herself.</p><p>Despite the  exertion of the last fifteen minutes, Sailor DarkStar felt fine. Actually, better  than fine, she felt wonderful. Feeding will do that to a demon. Youma might be  weak soulless constructs, but they had a bit of energy in them, especially if  one managed to get a fair number of them.</p><p>Recalling  her performance, the demonic magical girl came up with thirty two. There were  four when she entered the building, fourteen in the stairs, eight in the hallway,  and six in the storage room. It was quite the rush. DarkStar then looked at  Kasumi and shuddered. The agent seemed pleased with herself. It would seem that  DarkStar was not the only one invigorated by combat.</p><p>She did that not because the girl disturbed  her, but because of how similar that would make the Company agent to her.  DarkStar put her hand to her forehead and massaged her horns. It felt quite  good and helped her clear her mind.</p><p>Gabriel  raised an eyebrow as he watched the demon. Her tail had retracted its filaments  and was swishing back and forth in a way that was reminiscent of when his  sister rubbed her cat's belly after dinner. The then young man turned to  Kasumi. "Orders?"</p><p>DarkStar  walked down the hallway. She was looking for an exit. She then passed the cafeteria.  A pair of Company agents flanked the open doors. From behind their red-tinted  goggles, they watched the demon. Most of the hostages had been moved to the  gymnasium for processing. The Company agents wanted to be sure that they were  clean.</p><p>The redhead  looked inside the room. In the center of the room was a cluster of people. Jacob  was standing near the Drake talking softly. Below them a team of medics was  working on two people. One was a Company agent sitting on the floor and leaning  on an overturned table. The armor over his chest and arms had been taken off  and a medic was tending his wounds. The man seemed in reasonable sprits and was  calmly chatting with the female medic.</p><p>The other  casualty seemed to be in worse shape. DarkStar could make out the medical team  franticly working on a person. She could also sense an infection within him. Curious,  she entered the room. Kasumi, who was following DarkStar, motioned for the  agents at the door to stand down.</p><p>DarkStar  was able to identify the wounded person rather quickly. "Kuno?" she  asked, looking at the gravely wounded teen.</p><p>"Brave,  stupid boy," the Drake said as he looked at his son. Jacob put his hand on  the Drake's shoulder. When one works for the Company, one sees death in all its  gruesome glory.</p><p>"What  happened?" the magical girl asked.</p><p>Jacob gave  a brief summary of the incident.</p><p>DarkStar  shook her head. Kuno was a damn fool. "Can't anything be done?"</p><p>"No,"  Dr. Tofu stated evenly as he worked on the doomed teen. "The bastards  tainted their bullets. We're lucky he's the only one. At least, I don't think  he'll have to be disposed of." The doctor was quite familiar with death. Although,  most of those he worked on were not human and were already quite dead. His  voice was detached and clinical, save for his last two words. It was then that  DarkStar noticed the one of the nearby Company agents had his weapon pointed at  the boy's head.</p><p>It was then  that Tatewaki's eyes cleared slightly and focused on the scantily-dressed girl.  "Sunshine," he croaked out.</p><p>DarkStar  blinked at this. Murdock had told her that this form had some kind of identity  cloaking. He had seemed partially amused at how it was able to provide some  protection for the Senshi's identities.</p><p>"He's  in shock and on a lot of painkillers. He might be hallucinating." Tofu  said as he checked the teen's pulse.</p><p>DarkStar  looked at Kuno and shuddered. While she had no healing powers per se, she did  have an ability that might spare his life. She did not know much about it. Murdock  had seemed oddly reluctant to explain that attribute of her demonic form.</p><p>"I  think I can save him," DarkStar said as she watched Jacob sigh and turn to  the Drake.</p><p>"But  at a considerable cost," Jacob said as he looked at the Drake. He had a  fair idea as to what DarkStar was suggesting.</p><p>"If  it'll save my boy," the Drake said.</p><p>"Ask  him then" Jacob stated to DarkStar.</p><p>"Colonel,  he's in no condition to make such a decision," Tofu protested.</p><p>"If he  regrets it later on, I'll shoot him myself," Jacob said coldly.</p><p>DarkStar  shook her head in revulsion. "Kuno it's me."</p><p>"Sunshine?"</p><p>"Um, yeah.  Look I can help you, but you won't be the same," DarkStar said as she  knelt down near the teen.</p><p>Kuno nodded  slowly and then mumbled. "My life for you."</p><p>Jacob  ordered the medical team to pull back. He then looked at DarkStar and sighed. Tofu  checked to make sure his equipment was still recording. This would be the  closest he had ever been to an event of this nature.</p><p>DarkStar  leaned down towards the dying teen. She opened her mouth, her four elongated  canines almost seemed to hum in anticipation. Her wings unfolded and covered  the teen's body as her teeth made contact with Kuno's neck. While the demon's  teeth injected fluid into the teen's bloodstream, the redhead put her hands on  his chest and poured specifically patterned energy into his body.</p><p>She could  feel her blood and her magic working in him. The flesh they came into contact  with shifted and changed. The body was being   shaped in accordance with some design that DarkStar was only  unconsciously aware of. She watched as his wound was healed and the destructive  magics were removed, but that was only a side effect of the greater changes  going through him.</p><p>Jacob  turned away and used his headset to order a helicopter to land outside the  school. He then had a brief, whispered conversation with the Drake, who despite  his long association with the Company could not quite believe the day's events.</p><p>DarkStar  folded her wings and stood up. A little bit of blood dribbled down her chin.  She looked at Kuno and stared while breathing in short irregular bursts. "Oh  god. What have I done?" she asked with mute horror.</p><p>Tofu went  to the teen and took some readings. "Might live now," he muttered  before turning to Jacob. "I recommend immediate transport back to  base." The doctor then ordered the medics to unfold two stretchers</p><p>"The  helicopter is landing now." Jacob replied as the two casualties were moved  onto litters. "You coming?" he asked DarkStar.</p><p>"Damn  straight, I'm not going to let you kill him and dissect him," the demon  said as she looked at what she had created.</p><p>"Interesting  choice of pronouns," Jacob said, looking at the teen on the floor.</p><p>"Toronto  Trust Tower pad number three is cleared for landing," a communications  officer in the C3 said to a Company helicopter. The aircraft was a heavily  modified UH-60A Black Hawk that was part of a group purchased from the United  States on "military surplus" several years before. It was quite a different  machine from the one that had rolled out of the Sikorsky Aircraft plant in Stratford,  Connecticut.</p><p>Stillwater  looked at the large screen in the front of the room and smiled. The operation  had been a success. The Pattern Ys had been dispatched, and the next phase was  already underway. Teams from Forensic Pathology section were already on scene  analyzing the battle and collecting evidence. The  nature of a Pattern Ys body made analyzing their corpses nearly impossible,  including this batch which seemed more <i>solid</i>  than expected.</p><p>They had  even bagged another interdimensional gate to examine,  and this one seemed to be undamaged. Stillwater knew he had DarkStar to thank  for that. They had a fair idea of why the Pattern Ys had attacked the school. It  had also confirmed their suspicions that the Pattern Silvers were attending  Furinkan. The Company also had a fair idea of how these creatures intended to kill  the Senshi. Pattern Ys were known for their ability to possess and control  people.</p><p>There were  still several unanswered questions. Where were these creatures hiding, and why  did they choose now to attack? Someone had sent them here with orders to create  an ambush for the Pattern Silvers, but who?</p><p>Stillwater  reminded himself to write a letter for Chase's family. If not for him, they  would not have known about the situation at the school. It was a shame that his  relatives would never know the exact details of his death or what his job  really was, but dying protecting the innocent from terrorists was close enough  to the truth.</p><p>The  commander made a mental note to look into the cover story that Public Relations  section was cooking up. They were going to go with the old terrorist standby. It  was simple, believable, and essentially true. That these terrorists were not  human would be left out, as would the organization that had eliminated them. A  special group within the Canadian military would take the credit for the  operation.</p><p>Aside from  Agent Samuel Chase, they had only taken one other casualty, but he was expected  to recover fully. His armor would be sent to the Company lab that designed it  and examined by the scientists that worked there.</p><p>There was  one other wounded. Stillwater had watched most of what had happened in  real-time through the headset cameras and had just reviewed the recordings. It  was a troubling situation. They had just let a Pattern D turn a human into a  servitor life-form. There was some consolation in that the boy's father was  already associated with the Company and would be easy to keep quiet.</p><p>Stillwater  shook his head. Whenever nonhumans worked with the Company, problems always  arose. He had secretly hoped that the Pattern Silvers would be close enough to  human, but that was before he learned about Sailor DarkStar.</p><p>WIC Toronto-A  was a District Support class facility. Included in the underground complex was  series of medical rooms. Designed primarily for laboratory work, they could be  used for patients as well. One of the rooms was currently in use.</p><p>"Moron,"  the demonic magical girl said. The agent in the room were unsure if she was  talking to herself or if she was talking to the person in the bed.</p><p>"I  really don't need this anymore," she said looking at her miniskirt. Sailor  DarkStar closed her eyes and powered down. "Damn it," the girl known  as Sunshine Saotome said. She was wearing her Furinkan uniform. "Stupid  fucking fuku," she muttered as she walked to the room's attached bathroom.  That the fuku she was wearing now was <i>much</i>  less revealing and embellished than the previous one she was in was small  consolation.</p><p>The  demoness looked at her reflection and blinked. The pale girl with her crimson  hair looked somehow different. It was her eyes. The violet flecks in her blue  eyes seemed to be more numerous than they were yesterday. As she stared at her  face, her corneas seemed to flare. She shook her head and splashed herself with  water from the faucet.</p><p>Ranma  looked at his reflection and sighed in relief. He was back to normal. It was  good to be human and male. On that note Ranma turned back to the entity on the  bed.</p><p>"Oh  shit. What have I done? How did I do this? Why?" Ranma muttered as he walked  over to the bed, and for the first time noticed the changes.</p><p>The Company  agent in the room was a medic from Operations section. He was dressed in a grey  jumpsuit and had a sidearm, but his job was simply to watch the patient, who  was just starting to move. "Doctor, she's getting up," he said into  his headset.</p><p>The person  in the bed was not human, and not male.      What  had been Tatewaki was now a girl with a lithe, attractive form. Her hair was  the same length, only now it was black with violet highlights. She also sported  two small red horns on her forehead. Her eyes suddenly flipped open. Ranma saw  that they were now a deep blood-colored red.</p><p>"Mistress?"  the person in the bed said, in a clearly feminine voice, as she looked at  Ranma. Confusion was on her face.</p><p><i>I turned him into a demon-chick. Not good.</i>  Ranma thought as he backed away</p><p>The  demoness sniffed the air and the confusion on her face increased somewhat. "You  <i>are</i> her. At least you smell like her.  Tell me, are you Sunshine in male form?"</p><p>"My  name is <i>not</i> Sunshine!  You call me that again, and I'll finish the  job those pathetic monsters started!" Ranma shouted. He stared at the shocked  girl. "Well yeah," he then admitted.</p><p>The girl  nodded. "Mistress!" she cried as she leapt out of the bed and clung  to Ranma. She also had a pair of wings now. Black with violet tips, they spread  out and wrapped around Ranma's shoulders.</p><p>Ranma froze  and was about to enjoy the position, before he mentally chastised himself. <i>This is not a hot chick! This is Kuno you  fool! </i>"Get off of me!" he ordered the demon girl.</p><p>"Why?  You saved me," the girl asked, her face only a few inches from Ranma's.</p><p>"You  were dying you idiot!" Ranma said. He then noticed that her tail was wrapping  itself around his leg, and that the demon was not wearing any clothes.</p><p>"What  the hell is going on here?" Dr. Tofu asked as he ran into the room.</p><p>"She- <i>he- </i>won't get off !" Ranma shouted.</p><p>"Maybe  if you tell her again?" the medic stated with a small smile. Being in the  Company was a lot of work, but at least it was never boring. Although in other  circumstances, being this close a demoness would have not been fun.</p><p>"Get  off now," Ranma said while staring down the nude demon. "And what  happened to your clothes?" he demanded.</p><p>The girl  whimpered as she untangled herself from Ranma. "The hospital gown they  gave me was very itch. I'm sorry Mistress," she said as she looked down at  the floor.</p><p>"Don't  call me that. I'm a guy." Ranma then turned to Tofu. "Okay, being a  demon I get but, why's he a girl? And put something on!" he shouted to the  demon.</p><p>"There  could be several reasons. Your species of demon might be one that has only  females. Your curse may have done something to make him a girl. You might have  done it subconsciously as a way to punish him for hitting on you." Tofu  said as he walked over to one of the scanners in the room.</p><p>"Well  that's just great! Now I've got a demonic girl after me." Ranma said as he  looked at Kuno.</p><p>"You  don't like me?" the demon asked as her, black-finned violet tail swished  back and forth.</p><p>"Well,  not really," Ranma admitted. The girl had conjured a black bikini. It was  not much, but it was better than being nude.</p><p>"But I  love you," she said as she chewed on her lower lip.</p><p>"Why  did I have to do this?" Ranma said very unsettled. He can act like a guy  when he's a girl. Why can't Kuno? Was Kuno that deranged?</p><p>"Because  you didn't want to let him die," Tofu said after looking at a pattern  scanner. "Pattern D Class 2," the forensic pathologist announced. "Not  bad for a newly born minion, not bad at all. That's she's not trying to kill us  is a big plus too."</p><p>"Well  now what?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"What  do you mean?" Tofu asked.</p><p>"Aren't  you going to try and blackmail me? I did turn a human into a demon."</p><p>Tofu  smirked. "If we had a problem with you doing that, we would have tried to  stop you. You saved his life."</p><p>"Oh,  you guys suck as a scary secret organization."</p><p>"We try,"  Tofu said. He then placed a call to the Drake. "Tatewaki's awake. Looks  healthy as far as I can tell. Okay." He then turned to Kuno. "Well,  your father is coming to see you."</p><p>"My  father?" the girl blinked.</p><p>"You  do remember being human right?"</p><p>"Of course,"  the girl replied. "It's just kinda embarrassing."</p><p>"Okay,  I'm leaving." Ranma said.</p><p>"But Master,  you can't!"</p><p>"Why  not?"</p><p>"Um, I  love you."</p><p>"You  told me that before.  It's still  creepy," Ranma stated before walking out of the room.  He had to get away from Kuno.  There was something wrong about her.  Something that made Ranma want to pour lye in  his eyes to burn away the bad thoughts.</p><p>Jacob was  in Stillwater's office. They were sitting on opposite sides of a brushed steel-framed,  glass-top table. Several files on the day's operations were spread out on the  table. Displayed on a nearby wall were several graphs and video images.</p><p>"That  went well," Jacob said.</p><p>"You  think so?" Stillwater remarked.</p><p>"We  only lost one agent. It's a shame about Chase, but if not for his help, things  would have been much messier. We also got DarkStar to fight with us. Granted,  Ranma still dislikes us. But as long as he'll fight as DarkStar, things should  work within acceptable parameters."</p><p>"And  this incident with the Kuno boy?"</p><p>"He  was dying. Remember those morals that Ranma's got? DarkStar had to do  something. That Kuno changed sex too is strange. Section Chief Tofu has some  ideas about that, but until he gets more information he can't really say."</p><p>"At  least the secrecy from the Drake can be counted on," Stillwater admitted.</p><p>"It  has been tough for him, both his son and his school."</p><p>"It  could have been much worse."</p><p>"Yes  but we stopped them," Jacob carefully looked at his old friend. "Something's  bothering you. Is it the demons?"</p><p>"Only  a bit.  We've had NH's working with us  before. And it's always caused some problems, but there's something else that  worries me."</p><p>"Not  many," Jacob commented referring to the nonhumans.</p><p>"Our  practice is to deter recruiting in that field," Stillwater knew that Jacob  was a recruiter a few years ago.</p><p>"You're  afraid that we're being used as pawns," Jacob said with some amusement.</p><p>"Not  us. You know me. I'm past caring about such things. The Company is another  matter. Our organization will not be used."</p><p>"Yet,  you expect us to use the Pattern Silvers," Jacob stated. While he had no  problem with their plans, he would not let Stillwater indulge in hypocrisy.</p><p>"Point.  Although, consider their ultimate plans."</p><p>"We do  not have full verification of their intention to resurrect their empire,"  Jacob stated. The Company had done extensive research and funded several  expeditions in their quest to learn more about early-human and pre-human  civilizations. One of them matched what they knew about the Pattern Silvers.</p><p>"Exactly.  For the moment we are on the same side."</p><p>"If  you say so."</p><p>The Senshi had returned to their  apartment. Usagi had called Setsuna, but the time guardian was not answering  her phone. They were calm about that. As a group, the girls were used to  attacks on them and having an unreachable time guardian.</p><p>The television  was turned to the news. Understandably, the story was being covered by the  major networks. However given that the situation was resolved quickly and  without any hostages dying, it did not warrant excessive coverage.</p><p>There was a  single loud knock on the door. Makoto got up to answer it.</p><p>"Mako-chan-" Rei started, but was interrupted by  another knock at the door.</p><p>By now, the  brunette was at the apartment's entrance. As she put her eye to the peephole,  Rei got a vision. She saw someone holding the barrel of a handgun over the  fisheye in the middle of the door. She then imagined Makoto putting her eye to  the peephole. The brunette's confusion at her inability to see the hallway was  then cut short by the gun being fired.</p><p>"It's  two guys. They're a few years older than us," Makoto said as she looked  into the corridor, breaking Rei's fantasy. Makoto could see two men standing in  front of the door. Both were dressed in boots, slacks, button-down shirts, and  black windbreakers. One was thin with short black hair and the other was  average in frame with even shorter brown hair.</p><p>"We're  from the Company," the one with brown hair said as he pulled a wallet out  of his jacket. He flipped it open, and held the plastic sleeve his  identification card was in up. The slim card was bordered in black and had  "Willard International Consulting" lettered dark-blue on the top with  the "Investigative Division" under it. Aside from the letters W, I,  and C on the logo, those were the only words on that side of the card. The rest  of the ID was filled with several long strings of numbers placed in groups of  five. The man's picture was off to the left side of the card and a strange grey  logo that was a composite of a globe and several other strange symbols.</p><p>The other  agent had pulled his ID and was holding it up. "We'd like to talk to you  about what happened today," he stated as he removed his sunglasses.</p><p>"Really  now?" Makoto said loud enough that the agents could hear her.</p><p>"Let  them in," Usagi said.</p><p>"What?"  Makoto asked. "Um, okay," she said as she opened the door.</p><p>"Thanks,"  the black haired one said as he entered the apartment. "I'm Gabriel and  this is Aram," he said, pointing to his companion while Aram closed the  door behind himself.</p><p>"So you  girls are the Sailor Senshi?" Aram asked in a calm voice.</p><p>"Oh  yeah, that's them," Gabriel said after seeing the girl's reaction to the  question. These were the same five girls that had come from Japan, and their hair  colors and styles matched the limited profiles of the Senshi that had been  developed from their Tokyo observation team. Before today it was only a high  probability that these girls were Pattern Silvers.  Now it was almost certain.</p><p>"As  you know there was an incident at the school today," Aram said after he  looked around the apartment living room.</p><p>"We  believe that you five, and possibly Ranma Saotome, also known as Sunshine  Saotome and Sailor DarkStar, were the targets of a group of Pattern Y, youma. They  took over the school early this morning. We had an undercover agent who managed  to alert us early on."</p><p>"You  had people already in the school. Why?" Ami asked, interrupting him.</p><p>"To  spy on the Pattern Silvers. That would be you girls," Aram said in a  matter of fact tone.</p><p>"That's  creepy. Why are you spying on us?"</p><p>Gabriel looked  at Aram and shrugged. "<i>We're</i> not  really sure. The Commander and the Colonel seem to think that the Company  really needs the Pattern Silvers for these Toronto Operations."</p><p>"Oh,  so you guys are just henchmen," Rei said.</p><p>"Well,  we're in Operations Section so that puts us relatively high up, but, yeah. We're  basically grunts. Just this morning, Aram was up to his knee in youma guts, twice,"  Gabriel said, smiling and exaggerating slightly.</p><p>Aram  shrugged. He had time to shower, and Pattern Ys dissolved quick enough.</p><p>"Wait  a minute. When you came in here, you asked us if we were the Senshi. But if you  didn't know who we are, how did you know to spy on the school?"</p><p>"Simple.  Ranma was already going to that school."</p><p>"Technically  as Sunshine," Gabriel interrupted.</p><p>"That's  irrelevant," Aram said with exasperation. "Curious, we then looked  into the transfer records and saw you five. There was a very good chance that  you were the Pattern Silvers. It looks like we were not the only ones to make  such a connection," Aram continued.</p><p>"Why  are you telling us all this?"</p><p>"The  Commander thought you deserved to know what really happened.. You were targeted  by them after all."</p><p>"Okay.  How many of them were there?" Ami asked.</p><p>"Roughly  a hundred Pattern Ys. Most of them Level 3 or lower. Getting an exact number is  hard because they tend to dissolve rather quickly."</p><p>"These  ones were surprisingly juicy, though. They had blood and organs. Our  pathologists believed that these guys had spent a while living as humans,"  Gabriel said.</p><p>"Where'd  they all come from? We defeated them a while ago," Minako said, turning to  look at the two men.</p><p>"We  don't know. They did have a pretty clever plan to get in," Aram stated. He  then gave a brief summary of how the youma had disabled the security system,  gained entrance to the building, activated a gateway, and started shipping  their weapons and men over. "Right now we're tracking their weapons. They  look like old Soviet surplus. It seems likely that they were going to make their  move once school started. They would have turned the students and faculty  against you," Aram added.</p><p>"Although  the fools would have been better off if they had done some combat training too.  I guess they didn't consider that people might be shooting back at them."  Gabriel observed.</p><p>"A  hundred youma using empowered weapons, and a couple hundred humans that had  been turned into zombies, possibly armed too. That might have been some  trouble," Ami said.</p><p>"It  gets better," Gabriel said, smiling slightly. "They had an impressively  powerful bomb in their gate room. It looks like they planned to detonate it if  things ever went south."</p><p>Makoto  nodded. Youma were never ones to value their lives.</p><p>"It  looks like you guys managed to prevent that bomb from going off," Minako  said. There had been nothing in the news about an explosion.  That would certainly have upped the coverage.</p><p>"Well,  we had a lot of help from DarkStar. She got a third of the kills," Aram  said.</p><p>"Wait,  Ranma's working with you? She said you tried to kill her," Ami said, using  female pronouns because she had only met Ranma in female form.</p><p>"I  guess Pluto really pissed him off?" Rei said.</p><p>"Tricking  a guy into a fuku would do that," Minako sated.</p><p>"But  that's Murdock's fault," Ami said.</p><p>"Ranma  thinks that it's Pluto's." Usagi countered.</p><p>"I  guess we should go," Gabriel said as he put his sunglasses back on.</p><p>"You're  just leaving?" Usagi said.</p><p>"Unless  you have any other questions?" Aram stated as he walked to the door.</p><p>"I  don't suppose you know what's going on here?"</p><p>"Probably  less than you do," Aram allowed.</p><p>"So  the enemy, whoever it is, could know where we live?"</p><p>"We were  able to figure it out," Gabriel said, simply.</p><p>"That's  not good."</p><p>"You  want us to have some people watch this place?" Aram asked as he put his  hand on the knob.</p><p>"You're  not already watching us?" Rei skeptically asked.</p><p>"We  have a strike team in the area that's monitoring the police transmissions, but  we can place them closer if you want," Aram stated as he opened the door.</p><p>"No  thanks," Usagi said.</p><p>"Well,  here's our card," Gabriel said as he handed one over. In top left corner was  that strange logo. The star with the flame wreathed eye in the center was  especially creepy, and oddly familiar to Ami.    "Willard International  Consulting - providing definite solutions for clients  with special situations," was written next to the Company logo. Below that  was a phone number.</p><p>"Um,  thanks," Usagi said.</p><p>"Right,"  Gabriel said as he walked into the hallway. Aram followed and closed the door  behind him.</p><p>"That  was strange," Rei observed.</p><p>"We  need to find Ranma," Usagi stated. "There's more going on here than  what they told us."</p><p>The research  scientist looked out the window. The view was of pleasant rolling hills. Dairy  farms could be seen off into the distance.   The cows looked like white and black mites crawling on lumpy green  linoleum.  The woman sighed. It was a  shame her office was underground. At least the designers of the complex decided  to make at least one of their cafeterias above ground.</p><p>The woman  picked at her lunch. The report was late. In the eight years she had been  getting it, the report had never been late. Often it had little or no  information, things like a police report or a bank account being accessed. Other  times there was more substantial information, and once in a great while a  photograph. The most recent was a photograph of her son in a Kobe newspaper  that was taken two years ago.</p><p>Like many  in this organization, there was something that drove her, something intensely  personal. Like many it had to do with losing her family. Although in her case  her family was still alive. The woman felt confident that the Company was the  best people to find them. Despite what her husband seemed to want. They were  also the only private organization with the resources to conduct global  searches.</p><p>Finding  people that had gone missing under strange circumstances was what the Company's  mission was back in the beginning. Back when the WIC stood for Willard  Investigative Company. It was still an important part of the organization. Despite  this, people are often never found.</p><p>"Afternoon  Doctor," said a younger man wearing a lab coat similar to the woman's. He  had hair parted on the left, slim glasses, and a few freckles.</p><p>"Don't  call me that Aida. You know I'm not medical," she told the junior  researcher.</p><p>"Sorry,"  Aida replied. He was still working on his doctorate. It was a shame it would be  automatically classified secret by the Japanese government, but there was no  way around it.</p><p>"Still  going with the nine millimeter," she observed while looking at the Beretta  on his hip.</p><p>"I  find a heavier weapon a pain to wear."</p><p><i>Kids these days.</i> She thought. "Tell  me, when do you go on field rotation?"</p><p>"In  five weeks."</p><p>"Trust  me. When you're out there with those Operations grunts, you'll want as much  firepower as you can carry."</p><p>Aida nodded.  He knew this, but he was working in the lab now. The only reason he carried  here was because of the eccentric regulations from Command. If fighting broke  out in the heart of the Third Operations Centre, then the caliber of his gun  would be least of his concerns.</p><p>"I  thought you were going over that batch of AN-6 body armor we got from  Germany?" the woman asked. Her doctorate was in Materials Science.  Her specialty was in high strength composites.  She had been an instrumental part of the Company's next generation of armor. She  had just gotten a report of one of her vests stopping a point-blank Kalashnikov  round. She could not wait to take apart that one and see how it worked. All the  range tests indicated that that particular bullet going at that particular speed  would tear through the armor.</p><p>"The fire  damaged ones from Operations Centre Two? I had just finished the second one  when Commander Akagi told me to find you."</p><p>"Okay.  What does she want?" the woman asked. She was on good terms with the of  Science and Technology head.</p><p>"She  told me to tell you that they have found him. He's alive. Expect a meeting."  Aida recalled.</p><p>"My god. That's why the report was late," the  woman said in awe. After all these years, the Company found him.  She idly wondered how her husband had screwed  up and what they were doing to make sure he would not escape, or if they even  knew where he was.</p><p>"Good  for you," Aida said. He knew about the woman's loss and it was nice to see  things go well for her.</p><p>End Chapter 4</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Thanks to Joe Fenton, Jerry Starfire,  and Black Dragon for prereading.</p><p>And also thanks goes to the Military Analysis Network for  their excellent weapons information.
