</div><p>The Return</p><p>A Ranma Sailor Moon fic thingy.</p><p>By Josh Temple</p><p>Naturally, I own neither Sailor Moon nor Ranma. So here's  the disclaimer:</p><p>Ranma 1/2 and its characters and settings belong to Rumiko  Takahashi, Shogakukan, Kitty, and Viz  Video. Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon belongs to Naoko  Takeuchi, Koudansha, TV Asahi, and Toei Douga, and DIC.</p><p>Previous chapters and other works  can be found at my fanfiction</p><p>Other website Temple   of Ranma's Senshi</p><p>C&amp;C is always wanted.</p><p>Chapter 10 Revenge and Rebirth Part 2</p><p>Ukyou  opened her eyes. She was surprised to be alive. A more pleasant surprise came  after she looked her body over. She was still human. Turning her head she took  stock of what seemed to be a hospital room. The drab concrete walls were  somewhat comforting.</p><p>The wounded  girl leaned up on the bed to see the two other people in the room. The male was  dressed in grey Willard International Consulting jumpsuits. Ukyou recognized  the coloration and rank symbols on the uniforms.</p><p>The woman  was a Lieutenant in Medical section. Her chestnut hair was cut almost too short  to pass for a business professional style, and her brown eyes carefully studied  a clipboard in her hands.</p><p>The man was  a Captain in Operations section. Tall, thin, with dark blue eyes, and  close-cropped hair, he looked Germanic to Ukyou. His clipped accent helped  reinforce this perception.</p><p>"You're  awake. This is good," Jarvis said looking the Assembly acolyte over. "Dr.  Covington, her condition is stable?"</p><p>"Yes  sir," the female agent nodded.</p><p>Jarvis  continued. "We shall call your people. Unless you have a specific way you  want to us to contact them?"</p><p>"No."  Ukyou eyed the gun on his hip. She did not see her weapons anywhere in the  room. This was to be expected; WIC and the Assembly were not on the best of  terms.</p><p>"Really?  Unusual. Then we will use a number that we know of. Cooperation on your part  would be helpful."</p><p>"What  happened to my partner?" Ukyou asked. There was a chance WIC had separated  them.</p><p>"We  don't know. None of the victims in the building were Assembly. The building was  sealed, but we believe a high class pattern D still managed to escape. She  might have taken him or destroyed him entirely. We are still investigating."</p><p>"Oh."  Ukyou slumped. She had watched Ryoga fight that demon, and now he was... The  girl pushed those thoughts aside. Now was her chance. "I'm not going back."</p><p>"Pardon?"</p><p>"I - I  want to defect to WIC."</p><p>Jarvis kept  his face neutral. "Really? I'll have to talk to my superiors."</p><p>"I'm  sure they're already listening," Ukyou casually remarked.</p>-oo0oo-<p>Alexia  looked over her work. Teleporting out of the building was a pain, but it was  the only option. She was angered by the loss, but those demons while powerful  were still ordinary humans originally. Who she had now was... special. Alexia  had appeared in the large household that now served as her headquarters. The  remains of her brood watched expectantly when they saw their mistress' new  find.</p><p>The blonde  demoness smiled. The conversion process had some complications, but they were  easily circumvented. It was time for her to wake her newest creation. The  demoness smiled. She really was a lovely little thing. Alexia went over to the  sleeping succubus and gently rocked her awake.</p><p>The first  thing the young succubus noticed was her sense of smell, if one could still  call it that. The orange-haired girl could smell... another demon in the luxurious  bedroom, one that was very familiar. Then came the other sensations from the  new body. Her horns, wings, and tail felt alien and strange... The fangs were  familiar at least.</p><p>The new demoness was at a loss. Her  Assembly training told her that she must try to kill the monster that had  turned her or at the very least destroy herself. She shook her head. <i>Why would I want to kill my Mommy? And why  would I want to throw away the precious gift I've just been given?</i></p><p>The  orange-haired girl glared at Alexia. "Bitch! I'm going to destroy you!"  She then screamed after steeling herself. She would kill the monster that did  this to her, and then... herself.</p><p>Alexia's  face dropped and to the newborn demon the elder looked genuinely disappointed  and hurt. The smaller demon shook her head again. Why did she care what this…  thing thought of her. She was an Assemblyman, demons like this were prey to  her.</p><p>The girl  smiled in remembrance. Slaying all those demons had been satisfying. It was a  shame she had missed out on the chance to feed on them. That was such a waste.  She blinked and a slight growl escaped her lips as she promised herself that  she would kill at least one more demon.</p><p>Extending  the talons on her left hand, she focused her attention on Alexia, who was  simply watching this with a slight frown on her face. The younger succubus  flexed her hand and was puzzled at the sensation. She then looked to see  slightly glowing semi-translucent dark green claws coming out of her fingers.  Looking through the weapons she almost grinned. Until now her experience had been  on the receiving end of such claws.</p><p>Alexia  maintained her outward appearance as her mood improved. The former demon  hunter's self image was being shifted. The young creature would have much the  same fanatical hate and disdain to those not her own kind.</p><p>Loyalties  were being altered and reformed.</p><p>The blonde  demoness increased her influence over her new minion. The new succubus was  almost ready. "Whatever you do, I forgive you," Alexia lied in a  convincing tone. The demoness then relaxed her stance giving the appearance of  compliance.</p><p>The younger  demoness paused. She had not expected this kind of reaction from the monster  that had taken her humanity. "But..."</p><p>"It's  okay," Alexia said as she traced her fingers over the fins of the  newborn's tail. Alexia was sure that the new girl would not extend her tail  filaments.</p><p>"Oh...  oh... Mommy." the young succubus' eyes widened in horror at what she had  just said. "What... what am I?" She had her memories, but those were  what she was. The thoughts and sensations she was feeling now were more  familiar, more right.</p><p>Alexia gave  a warm smile. <i>She's almost ready. Just  one more push.</i> "I'll show you," she said as she stood up. The  blonde then lead the smaller girl to the a full length mirror.</p><p>The newborn  young demon looked at her reflection in shock. A beautiful seductress stared  back at her. Her nude, just over five-foot tall, body was perfectly  proportioned. Her large expressive eyes were a familiar shade of bright green  though now their shape was subtly different. The confused smile on her face was  accented by a set of slightly longer fangs.</p><p>Little  black horns peeked out of longish orange hair. Spreading behind her was a large  pair of orange and red wings. An orange tail with red fins was pulled around  and rested in her hands. Alabaster skin contrasted greatly to the tanned flesh  the larger blonde demoness, who was also nude, that leaned over her.</p><p>"What  do you think... my child?" Alexia asked, affectionately.</p><p>The orange-haired  succubus stared at her reflection, mesmerized. It was the most impressive  female body she had ever seen, and it was hers. A small trickle of blood flowed  from her nose. Releasing her grip on her tail, she clumsily wiped it away.</p><p>Alexia  smiled and cleaned up the smeared blood.</p><p>"I'm...  I'm a succubus," the orange-haired girl said weakly. The girl's eyes hardened.  "No! You won't get away with this!"</p><p>"I  already have." Alexia laughed as she pushed even more pheromones out and  used her hand to rub the other demon's left horn.</p><p>The young  demoness tried to fight the sensations within her, but soon she was purring and  leaning into the hand petting her horn. The feelings intensified, and the young  succubus' purring was mixed with cries of mindless pleasure.</p><p>The  orange-haired girl gave one piercing cry that was a mix of growl and scream  before she slumped back down. Her mind clouded she looked to Alexia, who then  grabbed one of the young demon's horns and twisted it. The newborn succubus  yelped and tried to move her head to minimize the pain in her horns.</p><p>"I'm  trying to protect you, Dear," Alexia said as she held onto her creation. The  blonde then angled the demon's head so the younger succubus was looking at her  reflection. "You've got great potential, but you are so very young."</p><p>Nodding,  the young demon studied her image. Alexia released her grip, but the newborn  could still feel her presence.</p><p>"What  are you?"</p><p>"I'm  Assembly of-" the demoness started but was cut off by Alexia caressing her  neck. The last bit of resistance crumbled and the girl embraced her new form "I'm  a succubus." Her tone was confident and prideful.</p><p>"Yes  you are, my dear Aurora,"  Alexia said, hugging the newly named demon.</p><p>Aurora  purred again, lost in the bliss of her mother's presence and reveling in the  glory of her own body. "I love you Mommy," she uttered, snuggling  with the succubus that created her. Aurora  reveled in the sense of warmth, protection, and love the larger demon gave her.</p><p>"I  love you too," Alexia said while inwardly smirking. Normally she would  have corrected her spawn telling her to call her Mistress instead of Mommy, but  she decided to let Aurora enjoy  herself. The task of molding Aurora  into the perfect minion could wait, for now.</p><p>There was  something that bothered Aurora. Something  that remained from her old life. "What about Ranma?"</p><p>"Oh,  the traitor?" Alexia laughed. "Don't worry. We'll tear her apart...  together," the blonde succubus reassured.</p><p>"Good."  Aurora's blissful grin turned  sadistic and cruel. "There's nothing worse than someone who betrays their  own kind." Her eyes flared and she laughed darkly. Alexia rewarded her  minion by rubbing her horns again.</p>-oo0oo-<p>Deep within the corridors of WIC Toronto-A a group of girls waited. The Sailor  Senshi had detransformed. It was strange to do this inside a paramilitary  complex surrounded by armed soldiers and a small brood of demons, but their  identities were already known and these people <i>were</i> on their side.</p><p>Rei eyed the two demons. They had  showered and changed their clothes, but she would still clearly recall the  blood and... other items splattered on them. She turned to see the redheaded  demon step out of an adjacent locker room. Ranma's hair was still slightly  damp, despite being pulled back into the style she wore at school.</p><p>"You girls sure you don't wanna clean up?" the brood mother asked the Senshi.</p><p>"We're fine, thanks" Usagi  replied as she pushed the image of a certain redheaded succubus helping <i>her</i> clean up out of her mind. The  blonde's frustration grew. She did not want some demonic <i>replacement!</i> She wanted her Mamo-chan! But  he was gone... killed by a lunatic, who Pluto seemed unable, or unwilling, to  help bring to justice.</p><p>Usagi had met Murdock and she had  done nothing. She chastised herself for not trying to... what? Kill the mage? A  part of her wanted to do just that. Murdock had killed <i>him</i>. It was fair.</p><p>Usagi banished those thoughts.  Sailor Moon did not kill people. She had to keep those thoughts controlled...  like other urges. She remembered what she did the first time her lover died... picking  up Venus' sword and... She wanted to be with him so badly, but she was needed  here, and unlike that time her Queen Serenity was not around to reincarnate  them. There was no assurance that things would magically return to normal, and  as much as it hurt and as much as oblivion appealed to her, she had  responsibilities more important than her own needs.</p><p>There was still the chance that  Mamoru would come back. It had happened before. It will happen this time, the  blonde swore. Usagi smiled at the thought. She would wait for him, he would be  reborn, regain his memories, and she would find him. It would be very romantic.  They would be together. What Usagi ignored, what had happened to her throughout  her life, was that fate tended to have a sense of humor.</p><p>"Yeah, we didn't get as bloody  as you did," Rei stated.</p><p>"I got some on me," Janet  said as she rotated her transformation item in her hands. The knife's silver  blade reflected the florescent light.</p><p>"It went away when you  detransformed," Ami said.</p><p>"And when I transform again?"</p><p>"It will be clean and fresh.  That's part of the magic."</p><p>"Oh. Then why'd Ranma shower?"</p><p>"I wanted to get clean,"  Ranma stated. After reverting out of Sailor DarkStar form she was physically  clean but she did not feel clean. Disturbingly, <i>she</i> felt more sweaty than anything else. <i>He</i>, on the other hand... It was not just out of concern for her  kids that Ranma returned to her demon form after the shower. The lingering taste  of demonic flesh remained in <i>his</i> mouth  too. The worst part was that feeding that way was not her worst option. There  were other feeding urges she had, fortunately killing satiated them.</p><p>"It'd be nice if we had  uniforms that'd clean us up," Akane grumbled. She had tried using her  powers to shift her clothes, but the gore remained, just on different garments.</p><p>Ranma paused at that. For some  reason her mind flashed to those demons with their fire shields. She then  remembered her own fireballs consuming bodies. The redhead shook her head.</p><p><i>Maybe  you shouldn't tear into your enemies like that.</i> Rei thought as she looked  over to see Minako happily chatting with Nariko.</p><p>"Hi, Mommy! Mina-chan thinks I  should get my ears pierced!" Nariko smiled cutely at her mother.</p><p>"What? How'd that come up?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"We were talking and I noticed  she didn't have pierced ears. It's odd for a girl her age to not have them,"  Minako said.</p><p>"Can I get em,  Mommy? Please."</p><p>"I don't know. We'll see."</p><p>"But you've got pieced ears,"  Nariko said with a slight pout.</p><p>"My senshi uniform has 'em."</p><p>"I've seen you with earrings in  school too," Usagi added, quietly. A normal, a girly, conversation had  drawn her attention. She wondered if Ranma was having problems like she was. A  loss of humanity instead of a loss of a lover. A brief glance at Ranma's eyes  confirmed this suspicion.</p><p>"Makes sense that it'd carry  over," Ami said.</p><p>"I wonder if Ranma's male form  has them too," Makoto idly remarked.</p><p>Akane snickered and Nariko giggled.</p><p>"Girls, that's not funny."  Ranma sighed at her daughters.</p><p>"So now what?" Rei asked.  She was not terribly interested in the demon's piercings. "Why are we  here?"</p><p>"I wanted us to talk to each  other," Usagi stated. "We should be working together."</p><p>"I'm just here because that  Assembly girl's here," Ranma shrugged. "They'll tell me when she  wakes up." She sighed.</p><p>"What's wrong Mother?"  Akane asked.<br/>"Oh nothing, just  thinking about the girls we killed." Ranma lied slightly. She was also  thinking about her eyes. It had happened again. There was still more blue than  violet in her eyes, if barely. On the plus side, if it could be called that,  the violet highlights in her Senshi form's hair had dramatically reduced. Ranma  was sure that the two were related, but did not know what the reduction of  purple hair meant. Purple eyes on the other hand...</p><p>"They're just demons," Rei  interjected.</p><p>Usagi almost laughed. It was true  that Sailor Moon did not kill <i>people</i>,  however she did kill demons and other monsters, many of whom where once human.  Some of them she healed, but others, like that succubus this morning, she  simply destroyed.</p><p>Ranma looked at Rei. The redhead's narrowed  eyes softly glowed in anger. The demon's stance changed ever so slightly.  Anyone who knew succubae body language would have been concerned for Rei's safety.  Except Nariko and Akane, who didn't  really care.</p><p>"And what about her and her  kids?" Ami looked between the succubae and the humans. "They're  demons too. The difference is that they're not <i>just</i> demons. They fight for the same things we do."</p><p>"But their methods..." Rei  mumbled.</p><p>"None of us hesitated to kill  that demon. We blew her apart," Janet reprimanded.</p><p>"Exactly, the only difference  is that we didn't drain our kill," Ami stated in a strange voice.</p><p>"You sound as if that's a bad  thing!" Minako exclaimed</p><p>"What? Of course draining's a bad thing! I was just saying that's the  difference."</p><p>"We didn't cut them apart,"  Rei counted.</p><p>"Uh... I did." Janet held  her up transformation item, a large knife that could expand into her staff.</p><p>Ranma sighed as the senshi argued. She  hoped that Assembly-girl would wake up soon.</p><p>"Besides, is it really any different  from us blowing away demons that used to be people?" Usagi asked Rei in a calm voice.</p><p>Makoto glanced at her princess. The  blonde seemed to have retreated from the conversation again. There was a  distant look to Usagi's eyes. It worried the Senshi, more than Usagi's nightly  crying jags. Puzzlement grew on Makoto's face when she noticed the small smile  on Usagi's lips. She wondered exactly what the princess was thinking about.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>From a display on the wall of his  office, Jacob watched Captain Jarvis' conversation with the Assembly acolyte. Looking  over his shoulder, Jacob saw Commander Stillwater enter the room.</p><p>"What did the general say, sir?"  Jacob asked.</p><p>"We can conduct preliminary  interviews with the acolyte. If she's a sincere defector we could learn a lot  from her."</p><p>"I'm sure that will be <i>easy</i> to determine," Jacob remarked  dryly. "She could be full of misinformation, or better yet a simple spy."</p><p>"Perhaps, but there's also the  issue of her partner. Our scanners detected a powerful Pattern D and a Pattern  A. Both have disappeared. If this was a setup, then the Assembly is much more  capable than we thought. Our knowledge of them <i>is</i> somewhat limited, but it's best for us to be careful."</p><p>"Perhaps our new guest can help  us with that."</p><p>"Maybe. So Section Chief Tofu  did not find an Assemblyman among the dead?"</p><p>"No he did not, but his team is  still going through the building. The carnage is pretty standard, but fairly  extensive. They have found several Assembly weapons however."</p><p>Jacob nodded. "I'll tell Jarvis  he can go a bit further then. What of Miss Saotome?"</p><p>"She was the one that saved the  acolyte from those demons. Make sure Jarvis does not do anything... excessive,"  Stillwater said as he got up to leave the room</p><p>"Yes sir." Jacob then pulled  out his phone. He would call Lt. Tendo and tell her to inform Ranma.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Interesting," Jarvis  noted. "So revenge was an initial motivation for your joining?" Several  sets of devices recorded his words.</p><p>"Yes," Ukyou nodded. She  was sitting up in the bed. It had been painful to get up, but the doctor that  had examined her seemed confident in a quick recovery. The worse were the burns  and cuts on her leg. Her mobility would be reduced somewhat until those healed  more. "It was a... family dispute between my own and Ranma's." The  brunette did not elaborate further.</p><p>"I see." Captain Jarvis  concentrated on keeping her talking. He could always go back and ask for clarification  in subsequent interviews. The important part was to open up a dialog with her,  to get her to talk. Jarvis paused to see if Acolyte Kuonji would continue of  her own accord of if he would need to prod her.</p><p>"Funny thing, my partner had  the same vendetta. Well... different reasons but the same target. Then we  learned that Ranma had been turned into a demon. Actually, Father Oslo told  Ryoga first. Then after Ryoga was almost killed by... Ranma, I was told who  that redhead was.</p><p>"Though it was Ryoga who helped  me see what was so wrong with the Assembly. Sure, he was always a bit...  obsessive, and he could be a real stubborn jerk, but he was a good guy. We were  killing monsters. Some of the things we'd seen demons do..." Ukyou had  bowed her head and paused to clear her mind.</p><p>"Sure they cured his...  problems, but they made him worse. Then I noticed that he was starting to get  strange... It got worse the more... proficient he became." Ukyou sighed.</p><p>Jarvis nodded. He had read the  reports on Assembly techniques, and knew they were dangerous but this girl had  more detailed information.</p><p>"I guess it ate at me. I  couldn't even confide in my partner. If he knew... if he suspected..."  Ukyou shrugged. Ryoga was a good little Assemblyman. He would do the <i>right </i>thing. She looked up to see the  door being opened. The agent that entered was unsurprising, but the person accompanying  her was...</p><p>The pale girl appraised the room. "You!  What are you doing here?" she suddenly shouted, flaring eyes that were a  strange mix of blue and violet flecks.</p><p>Ukyou reflexively pulled back until  she realized that she was not the target of the demon's rage.</p><p>"I am conducting an interview,  Miss Saotome," Jarvis replied coolly. He leveled his gaze to meet the succubus'.</p><p>Ranma almost smiled. It amused her  that these agents were still able to stare her down. They might be creepy, but  they had guts. "Really, are you going to torture her too?"</p><p>"You were fully capable of  stopping me last time, yet you stood aside and let me work." Jarvis darted  his eyes to the defector before continuing. "I even gave you the chance to  finish her off."</p><p>Ukyou blinked. She knew WIC had  information extraction personnel. She assumed they were equivalent to those she  had met in the Assembly, but even the grim-faced and black-robed members of the  Inquisitorial Branch never feed people to demons. Her appraisal of the  blue-eyed-blond changed for the worse.</p><p>"That was one of Alexia's  brood. This is a human," Ranma replied.</p><p>Ukyou relaxed slightly. It was a  demon that they were talking about. She tensed when the redhead turned to face  her. The demon studied her, and Ukyou was about to ask the Captain to remove  her. Ukyou wanted to learn more about what had happened Ranma, but not while  she was vulnerable.</p><p>"Ucchan? Is that you?"  Ranma inquired. "It's been so long!" The redhead then leapt up and  embraced the acolyte. "Why didn't you tell me you were a girl?" the  succubus asked while nuzzling her old friend.<br/>Impressively, Ukyou froze for  only a split second. She screamed and shoved the demon, who surprisingly  released her grip and tumbled onto the floor.</p><p>"Sorry," Ranma apologized.  <i>Why'd I do that? I guess I really missed  Ucchan, but...</i> Ranma recalled how affectionate her children were, and some of  the things she had done.<i> Stupid succubus  body.</i></p><p>"You have no right to call me  that, demon," Ukyou spat.</p><p>"Hey, I'm not evil!" Ranma  snarled.</p><p>"You were evil long before you  got turned; you and your father abandoned me"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You don't even realize what  you did," Ukyo realized with a bitter laugh. To have caused so much pain  and to be oblivious of it... She would learn what had happened to Ranma, after  she set the record straight with the demon.</p><p>Jacob listened as the two teens dug  through their memories to piece together what had happened. He had <i>interviewed</i> Genma Saotome and was not  terribly surprised by that man's actions.</p><p>Ranma looked into her old friend's  eyes. "Pops tricked me. I was just a kid! I didn't know that by choosing okonomiyaki,  I'd abandon you. I didn't even know you were actually a cute girl!" Ranma  slapped her hand to her forehead at that slipup.</p><p>"That means a lot coming from a  succubus," Ukyou tried to keep her voice cold but a slight blush did creep  onto her face.</p><p>"I'm not a succubus!" the  redhead bristled. "Well... not all the way. I'll show you." She  opened the door to the room. "Akane can you bring me two glasses of water?"</p><p>"One hot, one cold?"  Akane, who was waiting with her sister and mate outside the room.</p><p>Ranma nodded.</p><p>Kasumi watched Akane walk down the  corridor. "A little demonstration, why?"</p><p>"Turns out the Assembly girl's  an old friend. Though, I could have sworn she was a boy back then."</p><p>A ghost of a smile appeared on Kasumi's lips.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Mommy, if she's an old friend  she must have thought you were a guy too," Nariko explained.</p><p>Ranma blinked. "Yeah, Nari-chan  that's right."</p><p>Akane returned with the two glasses  and gave them to her mother. Ranma reentered the room and demonstrated using  the hot water. "See I'm still human." Ranma's blue eyes made contact  with Ukyou's.</p><p>Ukyou looked him over. She knew  powerful succubae could shape shift, and that she could not detect any demonic  energy was meaningless. Her own senses were rudimentary and a demon powerful  enough to change her form might be able to evade her detection. That water was  a trigger however...</p><p>"Jusenkyou? But I thought  demons were immune to that." Ukyou paused to consider what she had seen "What  is there a spring of drowned succubus?"</p><p>"Might as well be. My cursed  form's now a demon."</p><p>"And you just happened to turn  people?"</p><p>"It didn't <i>just happen</i>!" Ranma almost growled. It was for the best that  he did not. Ranma's male form was not nearly as capable as his female form in  that department. "I had to save their lives."</p><p>"So  you turned them." Ukyou's voice was flat.</p><p>"Yeah.  I know some crazy demon hunter like you'd rather die than live as a demon but  not everyone thinks like that."</p><p>Ukyou  tilted her head slightly. "I'm not that crazy. I did want out of the  Assembly." The demon hunter sighed. "But not like this... not at  Ryoga's expense."</p><p>Jarvis  noted that Ukyou did avoided directly answering the question. His curiosity as  to the nature of the relationship these two had increased.</p><p>"What  happened to that guy?" Ranma had wanted to... The martial artist paused.  He did not want to think about what he... no what <i>she</i> wanted to do to the demon hunter.</p><p>"We  don't know." Jarvis spoke up. "We were unable to find him or Alexia."</p><p>"When  I last saw him he was fighting her. If he'd won he would have come for me,"  Ukyou quietly added.</p><p>Ranma  simply nodded. He knew what Alexia would have done to Ryoga. They all did.</p><p>The  former acolyte steeled herself and looked Ranma in the eyes, eyes that were the  same blue she remembered. "Thank you." Ukyou flexed her fingers. It  was a reflex from her training. "If you and your..." She paused to  find the appropriate word "kids hadn't helped me... Thank you."</p><p>"It  was the right thing to do," Ranma shrugged.</p><p>Ukyou  smiled warmly at that. A succubus had saved her, a demon hunter, from other succubae,  and why? Not for the "purity of humanity" like the Assembly spouted  off or for whatever mercenary reason WIC used, but for something as simple as  it being <i>the right thing to do</i>.</p><p>"Now  what are you gonna do?"</p><p>"I  defected to the Company. I'm sure they'll want to know everything I know. At  least I'm out of the Assembly. I would like to get back at Alexia too."</p><p>Ranma  nodded. "I should get going. If you want to talk to me just ask one of  these guys."</p><p>"Uh  okay," Ukyou said. Ranma was the only person she really knew here.</p><p>Ranma  gave a slight smile and exited the room.</p><p>Ukyou  watched her old friend leave. Once Ranma was out of the room he used the cold  water to return to demon form. The brunette sighed and turned her attention  back to her interviewer. She started thinking of her future (it seemed linked  to the Company now), and how to make the most of it.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"You really wanna  see that?" Ranma asked her mother. She and the rest of the brood were  getting ready to use WIC Toronto-B's showers after their daily flight training  session. They had been intercepted by the ranking Science and Technology Section  officer.</p><p>"From what you've told me it's  a very interesting attack."</p><p>"I just wish the name was  better."</p><p>"It's cute." Nariko's tone  was eager enough, but her expression confirmed what she really thought.</p><p>"What did you expect Mom? You <i>are</i> a magical girl."</p><p>Ranma sighed. "Somehow, being a  succubus is less a problem than being a magical girl," she mumbled as she  activated her Senshi form.</p><p>"So where do you want the  demonstration?" a demoness with fully violet eyes asked. It had been three  days since she had first used that attack, and it would be good to practice  with it again.</p><p>"I'll show you," Nodoka  said. She lead them outside the building and across the facility's campus. Their  destination was a large block of steel and concrete down at the end of an  outdoor target range. The range was closed and a pair of young S&amp;T agents  were setting up cameras and sensors for what had to be a target.</p><p>"So how is the Kuonji girl  doing?" Nodoka asked as she was handed a clipboard by one of her  assistants.</p><p>"I dunno.  She seems happy to be out of the Assembly, but she did lose her partner. She  seems to have warmed up to me a bit." DarkStar's tail swished nervously.  She had gotten into the habit of visiting Ukyou in her... cell in WIC Toronto-A.</p><p>The doctor noticed this and noted  that her daughter had not mentioned what the former acolyte thought of her. She  held those questions and instead explained what she wanted Ranma to do.</p><p>Agent Aida checked the scanner  before walking back to behind the line. For once the weight of his sidearm was  a comfort instead of a burden. These Pattern D's may be the major's family, but  they were still demons. The brood mother, a girl whose height was hard to pin  down (she had very tall boots), was especially worrisome. He looked over to see  his coworker Ayami was her  usual composed self.</p><p>Sailor DarkStar smirked when she saw  the agents scurry behind the protective shield and man their machines. One of  them, the girl with an odd hair color, (a dye job, DarkStar could see the  roots) had the almost robotic composure, that was common to Company agents. The  other was more nervous and almost human.</p><p>The demon focused her power. A  fireball formed in her hands. She focused more and its surfaced smoothed over  becoming a glossy black. As she shouted her attack phrase she could see violet  and silver swirls forming inside the orb, just before it was launched out of  her hands.</p><p>It raced down the field and slammed  into the armor-faced concrete target. The orb split apart on the four inch  steel plate and exploded in a forward arcing cone. Strangely enough the  attack's secondary explosion seemed to come from behind steel armor. Later  examination of the high speed video capture and the test block would indicate  that this is exactly what happened. The shards from the DarkStar Burst, sliced  through the steel, embedded themselves in the concrete, and exploded. However  this was not the most interesting result of this little test.</p><p>"Was that what you wanted?"  DarkStar enjoyed blowing up the block, but it was not much. The demon walked  over to the equipment's display. A slow motion tracking of the orb's progress  was being replayed.</p><p>"I don't see what's so  important," Akane commented.</p><p>"It's hard to see without  obvious references, but that trajectory is all wrong." Aida pointed to the  screen.</p><p>Seeing the confusion on her  daughter's face Nodoka explained herself. "We've found something odd with  your attack." She then went on to explain what she wanted Sailor DarkStar  to do for the next test.</p><p>The redhead quickly smiled in  understanding. She might not get science that much, but she understood the  martial arts. If her mother was right, that attack might be much more useful.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>A tall man stood on a overlook. Rain  steadily poured around him but he did not notice. Unusual for the location,  there was little wind and the precipitation fell nearly vertical, and his  wide-brimmed had kept his head dry. Draped over his narrow-shouldered, but  surprisingly spry frame, was a long coat. The ends of plain but sturdy pants  peeked out of the coat's ends. These were tucked into a pair of boots that  while in good condition had been thoroughly broken in. The coat's material was  a faded grey-black oilskin that had clasped up the center using a series of  snaps. A large satchel, also made of oilskin, was slung over one shoulder.</p><p>His eyes were a muddy brown, but his  gaze seemed to dwell in the borderlands between dedication and obsession, faith  and fanaticism. His hair, what could be seen under his hat, was a light brown  that seemed to be of a respectable length.</p><p>Even without the notch in his coat's  high, almost chin reaching, collar he would have strongly resembled a  saddle-back preacher. These were men who went from place to place preaching the  word of God to towns too small to have a permanent Shepard.</p><p>He stared at the rain soaked valley  that spilled out below his position. Pine forests stretched bellow him. Out of  necessity, the monastery was in a remote location, but the man enjoyed the  scenic side effect.</p><p>"Father Oslo?" A younger  man asked, bowing his head. He had walked out of the monastery and like the  other man seemed unfazed by the rain.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"The Bishop is ready for you."</p><p>Father Oslo nodded. He entered the  monastery and after passing plain stone and wood paneled corridors and finally  through a small, but interestingly stocked, library, was let into a spacious  and Spartan office. There was only one embellished aspect of the spare room. It  was an immense, cunningly carved desk. The lovingly cared for oak glowed under  the soft lighting of the room. That thought brought a smile to the father's  face. He remembered the hours he had spend cleaning and polishing such objects  during his own days as an acolyte. Humility was important to impart onto the  young.</p><p>He did not  allow his recollections to disrespect the man who had summoned him. Father Oslo  bowed his head and let one knee touch the ground. The man behind the desk  smiled, showing a little teeth that while white and straight were still...  unpleasant. Though no one else at the monastery dared comment; besides after a  while they stopped looking off.</p><p>"Stand,  Father," the man behind the desk said, to which Oslo  immediately obeyed. "I wish I had more pleasant news."</p><p>"Bishop  Fortson?"</p><p>"It's  one of your proteges. Acolyte Hibiki and his partner have failed to respond."  Fortson's voice was conversational and warm.</p><p>Oslo  nodded. He remembered sending those two. "There were complications?"</p><p>The bishop  gave a slight laugh. "One could say that. It seems that the demon Hibiki  and Kuonji were tracking lead them  into a trap." The bishop ran a pudgy but oddly nimble hand over his bald  head. "All we know was that our acolytes went into a building crawling  with demons and Willard mercenaries."</p><p>"You want me to ascertain what  happened?" If he were a younger man he would have sighed, but he had  experienced the deaths of enough brave and rash acolytes.</p><p>"You and a squad of your best  men. I want to know what happened, I want you to make sure our missing people's  souls are laid to rest, and I want you to exterminate everyone who dared to  stand against us!" the bishop shouted, his voice finally gained an edge.</p><p>Oslo  smiled. The bishop looked soft but he still had it in him. "I will avenge  our people's sacrifice."</p><p>Bishop Fortson smiled, again showing  those upsetting little teeth. He knew Oslo would be able to take care of things. It  was a mistake to send those kids in, but they were only tracking one demon;  they were unprepared for such an ambush. It was a shame to have lost such a  promising young acolyte, but Hibiki knew the risks.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Why are we here with these...  humans?" Aurora spat out. Her green eyes scanned the filth that surrounded her. The  demon wished her mother would let her dispose of them. Or at least give her a  chance to train with her powers more.</p><p>"Watch your tongue," Alexia  corrected in a casual voice</p><p>Aurora stiffened and bowed her head. She had  quickly learned the folly of crossing mother.</p><p>"You need to learn the  usefulness of humans," Alexia said as she opened the salon's door.</p><p>The demon saw her spawn's respectfully  skeptical look. "They're a species designed to serve us as food, fodder to  make minions, or servants," Alexia whispered to her daughter as the  entered the store.</p><p>"Hello Alexia. Is this your  daughter?" the stylist asked. She smiled at the younger succubus. "She  is a lovely girl." The woman could see why the girl's mother brought her  here. Her body was very nice, but it could be complimented a lot better than  the simple t-shirt and jeans the girl had on now.</p><p>The orange-haired succubus nervously  licked her lips. Mother had gone through a lot of trouble for her.</p><p>"Daughter, it's a bit early for  that," Alexia laughed. "First we've got to give you a proper  makeover."</p><p>Aurora would have cocked her head in  confusion, but she trusted mother's judgment. She followed Alexia and the  humans to a waiting styling chair.</p><p>"Once we've made a proper  princess of you then the fun can begin," Alexia whispered in Aurora's ear.</p><p>The stylist smiled as she organized  her equipment. It was good to see such a wholesome family: loving mother and  adoring daughter.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Ukyou smiled at the warm rays of  sunshine on her face. For a few seconds she was able to put aside her worries. Her  partner's fate, her betraying the Assembly, her imprisonment, the aches in her  still damaged leg, and her... feelings for a demon, were out of her mind. Right  now she was outside, breathing fresh air and laying on the grass. It was a  welcome change from a solid week of recycled air, florescent lights, and  concrete inside that underground base. It was also a positive sign, her privileges  had increased</p><p>She was still on a WIC base, but  this one was much nicer than that other one. This was reinforced by the pair of  agents that watched her from a few feet away. Ukyou heard someone approach. The  person's footsteps were surprisingly quiet. Though his blocking her sunlight  was a pain.</p><p>The former Assembly acolyte opened  her eyes. It was Jarvis. "Did you pass along my request?" she asked  her interrogator.</p><p>"I did." Jarvis' speech  while clipped did not have its usual accent.</p><p>Ukyou suspected that he could switch  in and out of it to better aid information extraction in some way.</p><p>"The Commander is considering  it."</p><p>"It's better than having me rot  away in some safe house for the rest of my life."</p><p>"There is the question of  loyalty."</p><p>"I know, I betrayed one  organization. What's to say I won't betray another?" Ukyou almost laughed.  In all her dreams of quitting the Assembly, she never really considered what  she would do once she <i>was</i> out. Now  that she was, she found herself being drawn back into the business.</p><p>"I'll let you know when the  Commander does make a decision," Jarvis smiled</p><p>Ukyou's thanking response was cut  short by an angry growl. She watched as all the agents moved their gaze to the  direction of the noise and instantly moved to their weapons. Afterwards Ukyou  would realize that she had done the same thing, except that she was unarmed.</p><p>Soon they were rewarded by seeing a  trio of succubae fly over head dive down, pull up, twist and retreat. It was a maneuver  Ukyou recognized very well, a demonic strafe. Though she could tell that the  redheaded brood mother had added some new moves to it. From her prone position  it was quite an impressive formation. Her eyes could even pick out the  satisfied grin on the lead demon's face.</p><p>Ukyou suspected why the succubus was  so pleased. Ranma was fulfilling what she saw as her role as a male martial  artist <i>and</i> a brood mother, protecting  and training the weak, protecting and training her children. Ukyou could see  the martial artist and warrior within the succubus, and that worried her.</p><p>Jarvis cleared his throat and pulled  out a recording device. "You mind? I believe we were at the composition of  what the Assembly uses to treat their blades and ammunition?"</p><p>Ukyou nodded and started explaining  what she knew of the process and materials. It did not take long. "Is that  all?" Jarvis asked as he stopped the recorder.</p><p>The former Assembly acolyte nodded. Her  eyes scanned the sky briefly.</p><p>"I believe they're still on  base. Jefferson, Reynolds, take Miss Kuonji to the brood."</p><p>The two agents saluted and escorted  Ukyou around a couple buildings. When she rounded a corner and got a clear look  at what the demonic trio was doing she paused. It was not the flying that she  had seen them do earlier, and it was not the sparring that she had seen the day  before. It was a combination of the two.</p><p>Ukyou saw a curious mix of ground  and air combat. A demon would be flying in the air one moment then would drop  to the grass, dodge and leap back up, or would try to intercept her sparring  partner another way. The succubae instantly switched between aerial and  terrestrial modes. The brood mother was the most fluid though her spawn were  performing well too.</p><p>Even Ukyou's trained eyes strained  to capture their movements. Again she felt the absence of her weapons. The  traitor to the assembly of man watched as the redhead neatly tipped over and  landed on the ground in a tight roll. The demon then smoothly untucked and  sprung her body liken an uncoiled spring. Claws appeared and seemed to cross  over a dozen yards. The demon unfolded her wings and slashed into the air.</p><p>Ukyou blinked. The redhead had  turned towards her.</p><p>Ranma turned, reduced her altitude,  and landed a few paces from the brunette. She folded her wings back and her  tail lazily swished back and forth. "Hi, good to see they're lettin' you outside now." The demon then wiped her  brow. It took more effort in this form but she could still sweat.</p><p>"I guess it is." Ukyou  found herself unable to meet the demon's eyes... for very long.</p><p>Ranma could tell that Ukyou was more  than intimidated and afraid. Some of those emotions were present. The succubus  could <i>smell</i> them radiating from her,  but there was something else to. Ukyou's body language was also off a bit. The  redhead had become a bit more observant of such things. It was due to her  spending more time in demon form, and getting used to the signals it was  sending her mind. As such the succubus had a fair idea what was making Ukyou  uncomfortable. The demon sighed. She supposed it was a mistake to hug Ukyou and  call her cute. Though Ukyou was not reacting too badly. Ranma wondered if Ukyou  even knew what her feelings were.</p><p>However, the succubus declined to  broach <i>that</i> subject. She told herself  that it was to avoid making the defector more uncomfortable, but that was not  the whole truth. After what she hoped was not a terribly long pause, Ranma  spoke. "They been treating you okay? I know that Jarvis guy's pretty bad."  She then turned to her kids, who were still sparring, and waved them to come  over.</p><p>"No, he's been okay. Jarvis is  a professional."</p><p>"That he is," Ranma dryly  remarked. She recalled that little green-haired succubus and what Jarvis did,  and what Ranma herself did. The demoness turned to see her children land, much  more gracefully than they used to. The brood mother smiled at this.</p><p>Both Akane and Nariko felt the pride  their mother had in them. Their cheeks gained just a hint of crimson. "How's  it going Ukyou?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Why're you guys so at ease?  I'm a demon hunter."</p><p>"So are we," Ranma  shrugged.</p><p>"Yeah... you guys were training  how to fight other demons I guess."</p><p>"Sorta,"  Ranma laughed. "I've been tinkering with my family's school, modifying  things for flight, tails, claws. Stuff like that."</p><p>"I see." Ukyou's response was  a bit muted. She was at a loss of how to reply.</p><p>Ranma laughed again. This time it  was strained. The demon turned away and tried to reduce the information she was  getting from the human. She did not know how to handle what she was sensing  from the hunter.</p><p>"Ranma, Major Saotome's on base."  Kasumi had walked up to the group. She eyed the former Assemblywoman before  turning back to the redheaded succubus.</p><p>"Mom? Oh, okay," Ranma  sighed. This was not something she wanted to think about but she had to. "Akane,  Nari-chan, stay here with Ucchan. I won't be long. Come on Kasumi."</p><p>After the agent and the brood mother  left, Ukyou looked at the agents and demons that she had been left with. She  laughed nervously.</p><p>"I guess we can keep sparing,"  Akane suggested to her mate.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"I've done some thinking,"  Ranma said as she looked down at the glass coffee table in what looked like a  reception room. She could see her reflection. Even at the awkward angle and the  imperfect reflection the violet in her eyes was clear. "People die in what  we're doing. There was that agent you had in the school. Chase I think his name  was. I don't want... We have to do this but..." The demoness cleared her  throat.</p><p>"I don't want my kids to be  without a Mom. They still need me," Ranma blurted out.</p><p>Kasumi and Nodoka exchanged a  glance. "What do you... propose?" Major Saotome asked.</p><p>"If I... die. My girls will  need to be taken care of. They're a bit older now so I think nothing <i>drastic</i> will be needed, but still."  Ranma knew that Nariko was not strong enough to use the forced biting method,  but she might be able to do <i>it</i> the...  other way. Ranma hoped that there would be no need for that. Not with them  being at their age.</p><p>Nodoka looked into her daughter's  eyes. She knew what drastic meant, and wondered if her two granddaughters could  survive without demonic parenting. "Of course. I'd do <i>any</i>thing to help my family."</p><p>"Well... I hope it doesn't have  to come to that; you needing to be... something else. I think Nari-chan  could... You wouldn't be... minions."</p><p>Nodoka nodded. She had assumed as  much.</p><p>"Count me in. For my sister,  I'll do what needs to be done." Kasumi's voice was flat but with  conviction.</p><p>Ranma smiled slightly. Kasumi, and  her own mother for that matter, preferred to die as a human than live as a  demon, but if it would save Akane and Nariko...</p><p>"Good I'm glad we got that out  of the way," the succubus had one less thing to worry about. She stood up  but was stopped by her mother reaching over and hugging her close. The demoness  wrapped her arms around her mother automatically.</p><p>"I'm so proud of you. You're  such a good Mother," Nodoka said hugging the demon tighter. Ranma  responded by spreading her wings and folding them other Nodoka's shoulders and  back. Despite the disparity in height, the large structures easily accomplished  this.</p><p>Kasumi noted the difference in  stature. She could see that the redhead was wearing shorter heels, but that  still did not seem like enough. The agent supposed that Ranma was either  shorter than she remembered or that the demoness had altered her own height.  Kasumi shrugged. It was something to look into later. She decided to give the  mother and daughter this private moment and excused herself.</p><p>Ranma leaned her head against her  mother's chest and purred happily as her mother ran her hand through the  demon's hair. Nodoka was careful to avoid the redhead's horns. <i>I  just wish I could be half the mother you were</i>. Nodoka thought from within  her child's wings.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>A pair of beautiful bronzed women  leaned on a bar. They looked somewhat alike though their difference in ages was  too close for people to think of mother and daughter. The younger looked like  she was hardly the requisite nineteen to legally drink. The older had a curly  mane of blonde hair, while the younger had an equally long wave of orange  locks. They both had green eyes that evaluated the other patrons with hunger.</p><p>Aurora smiled at her mother. Alexia was right.  With the proper attire, attitude, and bearing, she did not even have to use her  powers... much. Aurora adjusted her dark green leather dress slightly. It took time to craft  the right mix of regal and appealing, but the young succubus was confident that  she had done it.</p><p>Alexia slid over to her minion and  smiled. She put her hand over one of Aurora's manicured ones. "Anything catch  your eye?" Though it was really another sense that the demons were using. Both  were scanning the humans looking for one who's <i>scent</i> indicated that they would taste the best.</p><p>The brood mother smiled as she  watched her daughter's reaction. The young demon was so eager to perform, yet  so worried about screwing up and disappointing mother. While Aurora maintained an outward appearance of  control, Alexia could tell how she really felt. Aurora's attention was on a human male who had  entered the bar just now.</p><p>Alexia smiled as she evaluated the  human. His physical appearance was good, though the demon evaluated him in much  the same way a stockman looked over a steer. The human's energy and scent  indicated that he would be filling and tasty. Alexia nodded her approval.</p><p>Putting a seductive smile on her  face, Aurora got up. This was still hunting. Something  she had done her whole life, even before... her life had really began. The  succubus fell into her body's urges and used information and training mother  had given her.</p><p>Alexia observed her daughter's  performance with pride, at her own skill in crafting minion. Her spawn had  quickly gotten the attention of her prey and started working on him. The blonde  demon smiled. Once you pushed the right buttons, humans were simple.</p><p>Eventually, the Alexia got up and  paid for her drink. Aurora had persuaded the human to go somewhere more private. Alexia did not  want to miss this. The demoness exited the building and took to the sky. As  Alexia followed the cab her daughter and the human were in, the demoness  smiled. Aurora had started to feed. It was just some  minor draining while she made out with the human.</p><p>Alexia landed on the roof of the  apartment building that the human had taken Aurora. Alexia could sense that the young succubus  was just about ready...</p><p>Aurora reached out to the human. This was it.  She was about to get a full meal... and if the appetizers were any indication.  She was about to make contact when she felt a slight draining.</p><p>The newly tanned demon looked down  to see a single drop of blood fall from her nose and onto the human's chest. It  was quickly joined by another. The succubus snarled and put a finger to her  nose. It came back bloody.</p><p>The human asked a question, but Aurora's eyes flared at the human and he was  cowed by her mental command. The succubus resumed her work once the flow had  stopped. She then grinned at the human that she had dominated. It was time to  get back to work.</p><p>In-between feeding sessions Aurora checked her nose. She smiled when it  came up clean. It looked like that was over with. The young demon had another  reason to be happy. Her mother was proud of her. Aurora basked in the glow of mother's  approval... and a different sort of afterglow.</p><p>Aurora wished other would let her kill the  human. She had gotten what she wanted from him, and Aurora knew his flesh would be as tasty as the  rest of him. However, Mother insisted she simply cloud the human's memory and  leave. Aurora pouted as she primped in front of the  human's bathroom mirror. Hopefully Mother will let her be more thorough with  her prey next time. The demon also hoped that the next time would come soon.  The energy she had gotten was good, but more important than nourishment was the  sense of power that she got.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Aram sighed and looked at his watch. He glanced up at the  overcast sky before looking back at his two companions. Conversation during the  journey had been muted, to say the least.</p><p>"You  know... it's a bit too dark to wear those things," Gabriel chastised his  fellow agent, as he locked the silver Company sedan. Aram sighed and pocketed his sunglasses. The trio of humans  made their way across the parking lot.</p><p>"Maybe  it would've been better if you guys had just stayed in the car." Ranma  sighed as he walked slightly ahead of them.</p><p>"You're  the one that wanted an escort."</p><p>"No,  I'm the one that wanted a ride." Kasumi and Nabiki were busy, and Ranma  could not ask his mother for help, not with what he was getting.</p><p>"You  sure your kids are... fine?" Gabriel asked, for the third time by Ranma's  count.</p><p>"Yeah,  they're having... fun." The pigtailed martial artist shook his head. He  had found that times like this were the best chance for <i>him</i> to get a break. While mating pairs of succubae were  surprisingly private with their intercourse, they still wanted Mother to  occasionally watch them perform, both for approval and for... suggestions.</p><p>"And  they'd better be fine. I am trusting you guys to watch over where we live."  Ranma knew they were not that far from home. If they got warning he could  change and fly over there within ten minutes, and Mother was there too.</p><p>"Of  course," Gabriel said in an understanding voice. The kid was concerned  about his spawn. The agent shook his head. He found it strange that a demon  mommy was more normal than... whatever this teenage guy was.</p><p>Ranma  groaned. At least this was less awkward than when they were in the car. He  smiled. He had seen the item in one of Akane's magazines and knew it would be  perfect. Ranma's grin increased slightly; he could even give it to Mother while  in his real body.</p><p>The martial  artist had his hand on the department store's door handle when he caught a beige  van reflected in the glass door. He watched as the door slide open. "Guys...  you see this?" Ranma asked quietly.</p><p>"Yah,  I seem 'em," Aram said. There was a large van idling in front a small bank  that sat in the middle of the parking lot like an island in a sea of slowly  rusting cars. The three young men watched another trio of men exit through the  van's open side door. Their long coats were not too unusual given the brisk  wind, but there where characteristic bulges in their coats.</p><p>"They're  human," Gabriel said while he looked at what appeared to be a combination  cell phone and palm computer.</p><p>"Call  the authorities," Aram said as he knelt down to check his shoe laces. His head  tilted slightly when he heard shouts.</p><p>"What?  Wha'ya guys talking about? Wait for the police?"  Ranma's voice was conversational in tone and volume but his gaze was even.</p><p>"They  <i>are</i> human." Aram shifted to check his other boot.</p><p>"Come  on you're saying you guys can't do anything to humans?" Ranma looked at  the two agents' guarded expressions. "Fine. Screw you losers, I'll do it  myself."</p><p>As  Aram stood back up a small smile crossed his face. "You  heard him Gabe. It's his idea, we're just providing backup."</p><p>"Besides,  it's a good chance they <i>could</i> be  working for the opposition," Gabriel added as Aram made the call to command.</p><p>"Stupid  company rules and goons," Ranma grumbled as he walked over to one of the  large concrete combination ashtrays and trashcans that flanked the doors to the  store. It had rained earlier in the morning and some water had collected into  the curved depression that surrounded the lip of the trashcan.</p><p>"Goons?  We're not that bad," Gabriel said as he adjusted his coat. The agent was  really using that was cover for checking the position of his weapon and extra  ammunition</p><p>"We  could have gotten something cleaner," Aram said after Ranma took the rain water and used it to  transform.</p><p>"No  time," the succubus said as she glared at the bank, and extended her  senses. "There's still one guy in the van.</p><p>"I'll  take the driver; you two go into the bank; I'll be right in," Aram said.</p><p>"Good  you're even wearing a purse," Gabriel noted.</p><p>Ranma  raised an eyebrow in curiosity. Despite being able to wear pants, albeit  leather ones, she continued to generate a leather purse. She suspected that it  was because of her time using one at school. Her eyes widened slightly with  realization at the agent's plan.</p><p>Aram separated from the two and walked around the back of the  van.</p><p>As  the girl known to many as Sunshine entered the bank she allowed fake shock to  cross her face. Gabriel delved into a similar type of chicanery. Three gunmen:  two in the main room watching the handful of customers they had forced onto the  ground and the last was collecting money from one of the bank's employees. No  one seemed hurt…. yet.</p><p>"Hands  up!" the taller of the two gunmen shouted at the two intruders.</p><p>"Bad  time for you and your pretty girlfriend to stop in, eh?" his partner  added.</p><p>"Just  get them down on the floor, Mike!" the one collecting money shouted.</p><p>"Right,  right," the shorter of the pair, Mike said. "On the ground you two."  He then waved his gun at them, a short pump-action shotgun, and suggested using  a few choice offensive, both in explicit and racial nature, that if they  cooperated they'll be home and having sex in no time.</p><p>Gabriel's  eyes darted to Ranma's purse then back to the gunmen. The redhead simply  contained her anger at their suggestion.</p><p>"Your  little girl going to make a deposit?" Mike laughed. "Darrel, check  her purse."</p><p>The  taller of the two gunmen stepped closer to Ranma, "Hand it over little  girl."</p><p>The  redhead slipped the purse off of her shoulder and reached with the hand out  holding it. Darrel responded by stepping closer. He barely say any movement as  the small girl blurred, followed immediately by an immense pain in his chin as  something impacted it.</p><p>After  smashing into the first gunman's jaw, Ranma tossed him aside and leapt at the  other one. Mike only caught a hint of movement before the redhead had clamped  down on his neck with one hand and ripped the gun out of his grip her other  hand. The maneuver broke his finger and almost ripped off a thumb. The demon  then pulled his head forward and slammed it into her own.</p><p>The  robber at the counter panicked. Things had changed too fast. Darrel and Mike  had been taken out by a little girl, and now her boyfriend had drawn a gun at  him.</p><p>"Just  kill the moron," a new voice said. "Hey Red, go ahead and gut these  two, then finish this last worthless bastard. I already took care of the  driver," Aram said as he entered the bank and aimed his gun at the last  remaining robber.</p><p>The  demon paused in thought. "Nah, this is boring me," Ranma said after  dropping the now unconscious Mike. Lack of oxygen and head trauma will do that  to a person. She felt dirty just touching such incompetent lowlife scum. At  least her real enemies were more of a challenge, and not just punks like these.</p><p>"Wait  no! You cops can't kill me if I surrender!" the last robber said as he  dropped his gun and put his hands up.</p><p>Aram laughed. "Sorry man, we're not the police."</p><p>"Not  at all," Ranma smiled showing a bit of her fangs.</p><p>The  last robber slid back. More afraid from the girl than the two men pointing guns  at him.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Yeah  sis, I guess I could do that, but did you have to ambush me like this?"  Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Sorry."  Akane blushed in that subtle way succubae did. She supposed that it was rude to  question her sister immediately when she had gotten home, but Akane preferred  to get this over with before Mother got home.</p><p>"No  problem," Nabiki smiled at the irony. For once Akane was the one asking  Nabiki to take her photo, especially given who the photo was for. "You  know my standard rate?" Nabiki said as she walked up the stairs to her  room.</p><p>Akane  nodded. After Nabiki had picked up her camera and some film, they went into  Akane's room, or at least the room Akane kept most of her stuff in. "Don't  worry, I don't need to many photos," Akane assured her sister. She had  been practicing in front of a mirror and had found the perfect pose.</p><p>"Good."  Nabiki fiddled with her Polaroid camera. She was not terribly worried. Akane  had asked her to take these photos. There would be no negatives. So Ranma and  Kasumi could not blame her if something happened. "Okay Akane, I'll do it,  but you're gonna have clothes on."</p><p>"But...  it's for my mate," Akane pouted.</p><p>"I've  seen enough naked demons thank you. And I'm not getting your mom pissed at me."  Nabiki had figured that Ranma was not home.</p><p>"Please,"  Akane whined trying to look her cutest, which given her species was not too  bad.</p><p>"Just  wear a bikini."</p><p>"Yeah...  good idea," Akane agreed as her clothing shifted into a tiny blue string  bikini. She looked herself over then paused and shifted into a less skimpy  version. After all, Nariko saw her in the nude everyday. "We're doing two. One with me looking  human and another with my full form." Akane then posed.</p><p>"Right,"  Nabiki said as she put the viewfinder to her eye.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"You  really scared the piss out of that last guy when you said you killed the driver.  Heck I could smell that he was <i>this</i>-"  Ranma held her finger a quarter inch apart- "close to losing it," Ranma  said before she sipped her beverage.</p><p>"I  said no such thing. All I said was that I took care of him. I almost wish he'd  have resisted," Aram stated leaning back into the booth.</p><p>"Why?  You know all the paperwork we have to fill out when we kill a civilian,"  Gabriel said.</p><p>Aram nodded. "Also don't think that having Red hear take  out his two friends like that didn't freak him out."</p><p>"Bah,  they're worthless. They let me get too close."</p><p>"Yeah  was very clean for you," Aram laughed as he took a sip of his beer.</p><p>"What's  that supposed to mean?" Ranma bristled. "Yah know those special  bullets you guys shoot are pretty dang messy too."</p><p>Gabriel  nodded in agreement.</p><p>"You  sure we should wait here?" Ranma asked as she looked around the bar.</p><p>"It's  the closest restaurant to the bank. That is where the Colonel told us to wait."</p><p>"Yeah  but I'm under nineteen"</p><p>"You  looked old enough that no one's asked you for an ID."</p><p>"Yay... the wonders of being a sex demon," the redhead  quietly deadpanned.</p><p>"Hmmm,  he's late," Aram said as he looked at his watch.</p><p>"I'm  sure the Colonel is talking with the police at the scene. Making sure  everything's nice and smooth with them," Gabriel sighed.</p><p>"Least  we don't have to worry about getting chewed out... much."</p><p>"What's  with that? I thought you guys were working with the local police. They didn't  seem to like you guys very much." Ranma had found the police were fairly  annoyed by what they had done.</p><p>"We  stepped on their toes by going out of jurisdiction. We're not supposed to go  after humans." Aram took a sip of his beer.</p><p>"Unless  they're cultists or mercenaries in the service of pattern registering entities,  of course," Gabriel added.</p><p>"You  know that reminds me about something Sophie and Rob did," Aram smiled. It was a shame what had happened to Rob, but risk  was a part of the job.</p><p>Aram had gotten halfway through the story about the incident  between the Peruvian police and those two agents when Ranma's eyes widened. "Oh  no! I forgot to get Mom's gift!"</p><p>"Relax,  Red. Just take another sip of your beer. You can get that thing for the Major  after the Colonel stops by," Gabriel explained</p><p>"Okay.  You know the only reason I'm having one of these is because I'm curious."</p><p>"Not  like one drink would effect a Pattern D your level."</p><p>"Yeah  and she's just nursing it," Aram teased. He and Gabriel were restricting themselves to only  a couple slowly drank too. They were WIC agents after all. "Anyway back to  my story. Remember, Sophie was pretending to be Rob's wife so that's why the  policeman said 'Mrs. Talbert are you aware that your cooler is full of human  eyeballs.' "</p><p>"I  can't believe Rob blurted his real name." Gabriel shook his head. "And  Of course those weren't <i>human</i> eyes,  and the case was hardly full. There couldn't have been more than a dozen in  there."</p><p>"Look  you wanna tell the story?" Aram sighed.</p><p>"No,  you go ahead."</p><p>Aram grumbled and continued telling the story. When he got to  the end, Ranma took a long pull from her drink and blinked at the two agents.</p><p>"What's  wrong with you guys? All that hassle just for some monster eyes? You guys had  to impersonate FBI agents just to get them out." The succubus shook her  head.</p><p>"It  was better than our backup plan," Aram laughed.</p><p>"Lemmie guess. You guys were gonna bust them out with  helicopters and a daring midnight raid?"</p><p>Gabriel  and Aram shared a conspiratorial grin.</p><p>"Never  mind," Ranma sighed. "What about those vampires or whatever that were  out in the woods to the South?"</p><p>"After  the Pattern Silvers and Lieutenant Patterson's team busted up their base  we haven't heard anything from them. We think they're done for." Aram  tipped up his beer finishing the drink.</p><p>"Though we did hear some  weird stuff. You ever see the Senshi in battle?" Gabriel asked.</p><p>"Not really. Why?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Get this. Their leader  Moon, she's got this beam weapon and Morrison swears it's a kaleidoscope."</p><p>The succubus shook her head. "Man  and I thought my powers were lame."</p><p>"That new one of yours has a  silly name, but, oh man, it's effective" Aram  said after coming back with another beer.</p><p>"You guys know about that  test too?"</p><p>"Only that you tested a new  power you found in that office building fight. Looked impressive," Aram  noted absently.</p><p>"You don't know the half of  it," Ranma smiled darkly.</p><p>Gabriel adjusted his coat and  looked at his watch. "You and your girls were doing very well that  warehouse and then in that office."</p><p>"I think it has to do with  all their training," Aram  pointed out.</p><p>"Of course I'm gonna train  my kids. They are Saotomes."</p><p>"Yeah, a bunch of bouncy  succubae doing their 'demon-fu' would attract some attention," Gabriel  said.</p><p>"Yes and what they wear's  got nothing to do with it," Aram  snickered.</p><p>"My uniform's a lot better than  what those other magical girls wear!" Ranma defended.<br/>"Yeah, it's got an  even shorter skirt."</p><p>"It's still better."</p><p>"Hey Aram,  what's with that gut thing back there?" Gabriel asked</p><p>"Hmm... I <i>was</i> tempted. We didn't eat lunch yet you  know," the succubus said with a wink.</p><p>"See man, some things you  can't just say around a demon."</p><p>"What? I kinda forgot what  you were for a min." Aram  shrugged. "Just handled it like any other operation. It's not like you  were gonna eat them."</p><p>"Nah… not worth my time,"  Ranma smiled with genuine amusement. Her eyes widened and she turned to face  the new arrival. The demon could have sworn she had not sensed the man enter.</p><p>"Well,  isn't this cute," Jacob said with a crooked smile. The WIC officer sat  down on the edge of the semi-circular booth pushing Aram into Ranma.</p><p>The  succubus blinked and adjusted herself. Unexpected physical contact was  always... odd. She was also surprised that it had taken her this long to sense  Jacob.</p><p>"Colonel  Edwards," the two lower ranged agents said simultaneously giving quick  salutes. Jacob Edwards glared at the two agents. "I had an interesting  conversation with a Toronto Police Captain. Two suspects with concussions and a  couple broken bones, one so scared he shit himself, and the less we say about  what Agent Kowalski did to the driver the better. He has some... interesting  questions."</p><p>Ranma  smirked. She knew that one robber was close to losing it. <i>Serves the punk right. That'll keep him from stealing.</i></p><p>"Now  normally agents from PR Section handle this, but since a Pattern Silver was  involved." Jacob gave a sideways glance at Ranma. "Commander  Stillwater felt <i>I </i>should handle it."</p><p>"What's  wrong? We did the right thing," Ranma said.</p><p>Jacob  smiled as he reached over and took Gabriel's unopened replacement beer. "Yes  it was," the officer said as he popped the cap off.</p><p>Aram glanced at the table. Colonel Jacob Edwards, one of the  few surviving members of WIC's groundbreaking Epsilon Team, this was Gunslinger  Jacob, Executor Edwards, the only way it would be more surreal was if Commander  Stillwater or perhaps Johan Willard himself had sat down to have a beer.</p><p>Gabriel  similarly boggled. Here was the man that was instrumental in their training. A  man who's operations were being analyzed by cadets, right up there with Sheppard's  Creek.</p><p>Ranma  simply shrugged.</p><p>"I  don't see anything wrong with your actions. You were assisting Miss Saotome  here," Jacob said evenly as he sipped his drink. He disliked the Canadian  beer but he drank cordially anyway. In truth this incident was something he  wholeheartedly approved of. This Pattern Silver had gone from using Company  facilities to leading agents.</p><p>The  officer allowed a small grin to form on his face. It seemed that his plan of  being honest and supportive to Miss Saotome was paying off. At least that was  one less issue to worry about. "What I'd like to know, right now, is what  actually happened. Unsurprisingly, witnesses at the scene were a bit...  unreliable." Jacob chuckled.</p><p>Aram spoke up first. "Well, sir, I took the driver. Annoyingly,  but not surprising, his window was rolled up. So I broke it, and extracted him."</p><p>"You  almost strangled him to death," Jacob noted.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"I  see." Jacob sighed. "And after that?"</p><p>Gabriel  took a turn telling what had happened, with Ranma filling in the details of  what she had done. "And you know what happened once the police arrived,"  Gabriel finished. "Sir, do we know who these guys are and why there were  there?"</p><p>"We're  looking into their backgrounds now. So far it seems like a quartet of simple and  stupid thieves. Though that would be a great cover for something more."</p><p>"Perhaps  someone else sent them to that bank at that time knowing we would be there,"  Aram suggested.</p><p>"Though  that would require surveillance of us and having those guys on standby, and for  what purpose? It's not like anything happened to us." Gabriel countered.</p><p>"We're  still investigating their backgrounds, their van, and their homes," Jacob  said.</p><p>"I  can't believe you paranoid loons. Maybe we just stopped a simple bank robbery?"  the succubus asked.</p><p>"Why  take the risk?" Jacob replied as he finished his beer.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Lieutenant  Tendo walked down the corridors of WIC Toronto A. She stopped when she passed  the commissary and saw who was inside. She first saw Captain Jarvis looking  over his cup of coffee. Kasumi followed her superior's gaze to see a quartet of  teenaged girls.</p><p>Inside  the commissary Ranma was chatting with her daughters and Ukyou. "Don't you  mind that he's staring at you?" The succubus looked at the agent with  narrowed eyes.</p><p>"Not  really," Ukyou admitted as she sipped her iced-tea. "It's not like  this place isn't crawling with cameras, and part of my defection was that I  tell them everything."</p><p>Ranma  grumbled and resumed her lunch.</p><p>Jarvis  smiled slightly. The events of Miss Saotome's life were rather noteworthy. The  young succubus', or was it young man's, life was intertwined with NH activity. Two  of Ranma's childhood friends joined the Assembly of Man, the martial artist's  own mother joined the Company, and in an attempt to get a cure he ended up  becoming a Pattern silver</p><p>All of  these events were largely due to the actions of Miss Saotome's father, a person  Jarvis wished he could have disposed of in a more permanent manner. Jarvis  renewed his smile. Genma was only part of the picture. The man was friends with  the Drake, a longtime associate of WIC. The Company connection was largely due  to Drake.</p><p>Jarvis  was always fascinated by the connections between people, the secrets they held,  the interlocking way one event fell into another. This was part of the reason the  officer had the job he did.</p><p>He got  to pry the information out and analyze it, and it was all distant and  professional. It rarely got personal, though often it was messy. Jarvis blinked.  Was what he did that impersonal? The officer shook his head; he did what he had  to do.</p><p>Jarvis  then looked to see one of his team leaders enter the commissary, carrying what  looked like a prototype weapon.</p><p>"Hi  sis!" Akane exclaimed as Kasumi entered.</p><p>"Hello,"  Kasumi said as she sat down next to Ukyou. Opposite them, Ranma sat with her  kids on either side of her.</p><p>"That  looks new," Ukyou noted looking at the weapon Kasumi was holding.</p><p>"It's  the new series," Kasumi said.</p><p>"What's  the deal with those things anyway? You guys even have a name for 'em?" Ranma asked, only partially interested.</p><p>Kasumi  grinned and began her speech. "As you know the standard WIC weapon fires  two sizes of ammunition allowing for more flexibility and firepower. The design  is based off of the Objective Individual Combat Weapon the US Army is  developing. Our version has some changes. Most notably the using a 7.62mm round  for the lower barrel instead of the 5.56mm, allowing for more customization in  ammunition.</p><p>"The  Company version was initially called the Heavy Armament Optional Weapon."  Kasumi laughed. "Of course the design did have some problems. It was  heavy. Problematically so in the first versions. And it had problems in loading  and in separation of the 20mm section. Naturally, to give it a better nickname  agents started calling it the Heavy armament Optional Gun."</p><p>"HAOG?  Wait... HOG?" Ukyou asked after decoding the new abbreviation.</p><p>"Uh  yeah... great," the redheaded demon sighed.</p><p>"Though  this versions not nearly as hoggish." Kasumi lifted the weapon. "We've  got your mother to thank for that," the officer then said to her fiance.</p><p>"Mom  made that?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"The  major designed new lighter components for it, still needs to be tested to make  sure it can handle the battlefield though."</p><p>"Can  I see it?" Ukyou was curios in how WIC armaments compared to those of her  former organization. Kasumi complied but not before dropping both magazines and  working the actions to remove any chambered rounds.</p><p>Ukyou  was neither surprised that the weapon was loaded nor at Kasumi's actions. She  lifted the gun and practiced shouldering it. "Nice, it is a lot lighter.  Wouldn't have any problem carrying this all day," Ukyou said as she handed  the weapon back.</p><p>"You've  used one of these before?"</p><p>"The  Assembly has acquired WIC weapons in the past," Ukyou flatly replied. It  made sense. After all WIC has gotten Assembly weapons... and personnel. Though  most of the time such weapons were scavenged after battles with NH. WIC and the  Assembly rarely fought each other directly.</p><p>Ukyou  remembered when her partner had first fought Ranma. He had lost one of his  umbrella swords. Undoubtedly, it was now resting in a WIC warehouse somewhere. Not  that her partner would care about that... not anymore. Once again, she hoped  that Alexia had simply drained, killed, and eaten her partner instead of  something worse.</p><p>Kasumi  nodded. "I just got back from some field tests at the B base,"</p><p>"Really?  We're just going there for some training," Nariko said.</p><p>"Is  Miss Kuonji going too?"  Kasumi's voice had gained some distance as she eyed the former Assembly  acolyte.</p><p>"You  can call her Ukyou, sis," Akane said.</p><p>Kasumi  noted that Akane did not say <i>Ucchan</i>;  the agent turned her gaze to the demon. "I'm going to drop this off at the  Major's lab. You want to come?"</p><p>"Thanks  for reminding me," Ranma said getting up and picking up the box her  mother's gift was in. The redhead then hugged her daughters. "You two play  nice with Ucchan until I get back," Ranma said before following Kasumi out  of the room.</p><p>"I'll  have Aram drive you to the other base; he and Gabe aren't doing anything now,"  Kasumi decided. Sophie, the forth member of Kasumi's team, was still at the B  facility going over a control test with the previous model weapon.</p><p>"Sounds  good."</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"You're  testing the new model too?" Ukyou asked eyeing the metal case that lay  between the two front seats to the WIC van.</p><p>"Sure,"  Aram shrugged as he drove the vehicle. "We are the ones who're gonna use  these things, they'd better have us test them. Isn't that what the Assembly  does with you guys?"</p><p>"Not  really," Ukyou sighed. "Our weapons are more custom made based on our  own abilities."</p><p>"Tell  me about it," Ranma grumbled from a the back bench seat. That umbrella was  a pretty annoying weapon. She was in her usual position between her daughters.</p><p>"Yeah,"  Ukyou sighed. Ryoga had told her what he managed to do to the demon.</p><p>"Creepy  little cultists," Aram said before glancing at Ukyou.</p><p>"No  you're right; why do you think I quit?" Ukyou asked with a shrug.</p><p>"Heh... It's kinda funny. WIC's not the creepiest bunch of  demon hunters is it?" Ranma shifted over to give Nariko more room.</p><p>"Not  by a long shot," Ukyou grimly remarked.</p><p>"Next  time we go out you should bring your kids. They didn't have to stay home,"  Aram offered.</p><p>"Yeah  Mommy, you went without us," Nariko pouted.</p><p>"You  two were busy last night; I was just gonna buy Mom's gift but then we spotted  those idiot robbers"</p><p>"Yeah,  took longer waiting for the Colonel than taking care of them," Aram shook  his head.</p><p>"What  do you expect. It's not like those guys were a challenge or anything, just  scum." Ranma leaned back slightly.</p><p>"That  they were," Aram agreed.</p><p>"Maybe you can come Ucchan," Ranma  suggested.</p><p>"I  don't know." Ukyou looked out the passenger side window</p><p>"Why  not? You are getting more privileges. Being allowed outside and..." Ranma's  voice slowed as she spoke, something was <i>off</i>.  She looked to see similar worry erupt on her daughters' faces followed by Ukyou  starting to blink.</p><p>The  scanner in the van started to chirp in an irritating pulse of increasing  frequency. "Shit," Aram swore as he increased the vehicle's speed and  activated his radio. "This is Agent Kowalski my scanner's going off,  hasn't been resolved yet." Aram then told his location and what the  scanner could tell him.</p><p>"Alexia!"  Ranma shouted when it became clear what was coming.</p><p>That  was when the fireballs started to hit the van. The first couple hit the roof of  the vehicle, deformed it, and started to burn through. A pair slammed into the  back of the truck; one blew apart the rear windows another uselessly hit the  bumper. One fireball hit the rear wheel well and dripped onto the tire blowing  it apart.</p><p>"Stop  the car!" the redheaded succubus ordered as she transformed into her  DarkStar form. "Kids!" the succubus pointed to her sides before  looking up herself. As Aram braked the vehicle, DarkStar leapt up and tore her  way trough the roof of the van. Akane dived through the window and took flight,  while Nariko simply opened the passenger sliding door and jumped out.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar extended her wings and gained altitude. Sensing where the majority of  the succubae were she turned towards them. A frown crossed the demon's face, she  would have preferred the enemy's formations to be tighter but... She then  ordered her kids to take flanking positions on either side of her</p><p>"DarkStar  Burst!" she shouted generating and expelling the black orb at the closest enemy  demon. The targeted succubus dropped her altitude hoping to avoid it.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar simply smiled and concentrated. The obsidian orb jigged down just  enough to smash through the point where the succubus's wings joined her back.  Then curved up gaining altitude until it slammed into a succubus. The sphere  blew apart dissolving the demoness into a cloud of meat, blood, and bone. Shards  from it burst out and a fair number impacted into the flesh of demons. The  embedded fragments then exploded, crippling or killing six more demons. The  redheaded demon smiled as she absorbed energy from her kills.</p><p>As  this happened Akane and Nariko had fired their own, simpler, fireballs hitting  those that their mother had missed or only wounded.</p><p>Aram  handed his sidearm to Ukyou who immediately dropped the safety before opening  the gun between the seats. "How long 'til backup comes?" Ukyou asked  as Aram tossed a pair of clips to her.</p><p>Aram  thought of the fast response team the Company kept next to a helicopter. "No  more than ten or so minutes," Aram said as he pulled out the HOG and  checked the ammunition.</p><p>The  agent opened the van door and as he stepped out aimed the weapon to the sky "Watch  my back!" he shouted and fired at his first target, and started to run  from the van to the forest.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar banked off to the side as a white-haired succubus below and to the  front of her exploded. In actuality, the 20mm high explosive round had <i>only</i> blown apart the demon's torso. The  succubus' extremities separated and tumbled to the ground where they splattered  across the width road and well into the woods on either side of it.</p><p>"Morons!"  Aurora screamed as she watched her sisters die. It was supposed to be a simple  mission: hit the van fly in and kill the humans and the traitor and subdue and  rescue Eclipse and her mate. <i>This is my  first mission. Mother has trusted me to do this. I won't fail her.</i> Aurora  swore.</p><p>"Kill  the humans!" Aurora ordered as she closed in to deal with the traitor  herself.</p><p>DarkStar  and her kids flew through their opponents using their superior maneuverability  and training to weed out their enemies. Support fire from the ground helped.  Although, some of the shots Aram fired were dangerously <i>close</i>, but his accuracy was unnervingly good.</p><p>"Fuck!"  Aram swore, switching to 7.62mm mode on his gun. A three round burst of  silver jacketed rounds blew apart the closest succubus' skull and gave him  enough time to drop the spent 20mm magazine and slap in a fresh one and  switched back to it.</p><p>"Pretty  much," Ukyou agreed as she finally took down the succubus that had tried  to circle around them. The trees gave them cover, but it worked both ways. The  demoness was wounded but she was getting closer. At least they weren't exposed out  on the road by the smoldering van.</p><p>The agent  narrowed his eyes as a pair of demons swooped down to try to surprise him. He  fired two shots. The first demon was hit in the navel and lost everything  between her knees and her breasts. The second flared her aura and instead of  trying to dodge she lobbed the fireball she was holding.</p><p>Aram  depressed the trigger killing the succubus, just before his head was consumed  by the magical napalm.</p><p>Ukyou  turned and took the weapon from the dead man's hands. She shuddered and tried  to avoid looking directly at the still burning, melted, and charred remains of  his head. At least he went quickly enough. She  shouldered the weapon and backed a few more paces deeper into the forest.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar pursued the handful of remaining succubae, picking off the stragglers.  A pack of almost twenty had been quickly decimated, though some were so weak  they could hardly summon fireballs or fly worth a damn.</p><p>Those  of Alexia's brood that were still alive seemed intent on getting to Ukyou  and... the redheaded demon's eyes widened when she got a clearer look at the  slumped figure at the edge of the forest.</p><p>She  swept back her wings and speed down to the scene. A succubus flew up to stop  her but DarkStar simply dodged the incoming fireballs, extended her tail  filaments, and whipped the weapon into the enemy's face as she corkscrewed past  her. The energy collected hardly registered as she continued in.</p><p>Nariko  and Akane gave a worried glance at their mother but followed her.</p><p>Ukyou  swore as she switched to 7.62mm mode, once again wishing she had had the  time to loot Aram's corpse for ammunition. A trail of demon remains marked her  trail deeper into the woods. She calmed her breathing as she tracked her  surroundings. The succubae had smartened up. Instead of charging and trying to  launch their fireballs at her, they tried to shoot from a more concealed  position. All the time forcing her to expend ammunition.</p><p>Her  senses pricked and she twisted around firing a couple bursts at the succubus  that had tried to come in behind her. Before the demon could hit the ground  another came from the opposite direction. Ukyou reversed her position and shot  the remaining rounds into the other succubus. Dropping the now useless HOG and  pulling out Aram's other gun Ukyou wondered how much time had passed and when  backup would come.</p><p>"Not  having a good day, are we Assemblywoman?" a sensual voice, from above  taunted.</p><p>Ukyou  brought her weapon up and fired. The bullet was deflected by the succubus' fire  shield. The flames of the aura were a familiar green. Ukyou squeezed off a  second shot but the gun was knocked off by the target as the orange-haired  succubus instantly closed the distance between them.</p><p>"Mother's  going to be very angry," Aurora said almost conversationally as she  disarmed the human and pinned her arms back. "I suppose I should bring  back something for our troubles." The succubus drained a bit from her  prisoner savoring the flavor of the energy. The human was quite tasty and had  potential "Don't worry, you'll love being one of us," Aurora  whispered this human was familiar.</p><p>"Ryoga?"  DarkStar asked as she landed a few paces from the former assembly acolytes. The  orange-haired succubus' scent was familiar despite the obvious changes. "Oh  man, I mean, I knew this might have happened to you but still."</p><p>"My  name is Aurora. I will kill you, you filthy traitor," Aurora snarled, her  eyes flaring green. She then pulled Ukyou in front of her and renewed her aura.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar sighed. It looked like this version of Ryoga was just as crazy as the  church nut.</p><p>Ukyou  blinked. Even if Ryoga was not totally gone, she was still a servant of  Alexia's will. She then gave a short nod to the redheaded demon.</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar saw this and knew what she had to do. As she spoke her eyes began to  angrily flare violet "Fine. Kill the damn human! Not that it matters. We  survived and you and your little friends are all going to die. We've fought  before and this time you don't have your little anti-demon toys; now you're  just a weak little newborn."</p><p>Aurora  extended her claws, and was blasted by a pair of violet beams that came from  the traitor's eyes. The violet energy narrowly missed Ukyou and burned through  Aurora's aura, shoulder and a good portion of the spot above her left breast.</p><p>"Forgot  I could do that didn't you!" DarkStar yelled as she ran forward, intent on  feeding. Her friend had been killed and she was going to get her not so  metaphorical pound of flesh.</p><p>As  Aurora was blown back, she ran the claws on her left hand across the front of  Ukyou's stomach. Aurora regained her balance and glanced between her bloody  claws and the gaping wound in her. "We'll see how much you care about  humans." Aurora taunted as she spread her wings.</p><p>"Ahh  hell!" Ukyou gasped as she sat slumped on the forest floor trying to hold  herself together.</p><p>DarkStar  looked down at the blood streaming out of Ukyou's wounds and the bits of  intestine poking out between her arms and the tattered remains of her shirt.</p><p>"See  you girls later," Aurora laughed as she flew off, now more concerned about  Mother's reaction to her... failure.</p><p>Kneeling  over Ukyou's form Sailor DarkStar took a closer look at the dying girl. Her  demonic senses made that abundantly clear. "Ucchan!" DarkStar blinked  to clear the tears from her eyes. "Ucchan... is... anything at all?"  she asked as she hugged Ukyou.</p><p>"Turn  me," Ukyou gasped. If this had happened to her two weeks ago she would  have asked for Aram's gun instead.</p><p>"What?  You know what that means?" the redheaded demon whimpered as the tears  forming in her eyes started to freely fall down her cheeks.</p><p>"Of  course I do jackass! Do it!" Ukyou shouted, glaring at the demon.</p><p>DarkStar  looked at the girl she held, the scent of her blood and sweat filled the  demon's nose. "Why then?"</p><p>"I  just got out and I don't wanna die like this, with  you I have a chance." Ukyou's frustration grew. There was another reason,  but she decided to hold back on telling it, while she still could.</p><p>Akane  and Nariko watched in silence, holding hands and watching for enemies. They  knew what was going on.</p><p>DarkStar  nodes and wrapped her wings around the human. "Last chance?" Ukyou cried  in pain but nodded in agreement. The demon pooled her energy and bit into the  human's neck.</p><p>Ukyou  felt and <i>alien</i> presence intrude into  her body and start changing it. Her flesh rippled and shifted as her body  altered and formed into a new design. She quickly passed out letting her new  mother complete the work in silence.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Oh  shit," Lieutenant Patterson said from his door-gunner position on  the WIC Blackhawk helicopter. He could just make out the plume of smoke rising  from the road. It matched the location Agent Kowalski had given them. "Rich  you see anything?"</p><p>"Just  a cluster of stationary pattern D's one is maybe Class 11 and definitely  Pattern Silver too." Specialist Agent Morrison replied.</p><p>"That's  them, at least they survived," Patterson said before ordering his team to  check their rappelling gear again.</p><p>"There's  dead in the road," the pilot said over the communications link which was  also connected to base. "I see a grey Company van. It is on fire."</p><p>"Bring  us down. I want you to maintain orbit for fire support," Patterson ordered  the pilot.</p><p>"Yes  sir." The pilot then reduced the altitude of the helicopter and held it  level over the road long enough for Patterson's team to descend to the ground.</p><p>"That's  a lotta dead demons," Stevenson remarked as he  looked down the road, his weapon at the ready. His HOG was set to 20mm mode.</p><p>"Yeah  the cleanup geeks are gonna have a field day," Morrison remarked as  he inspected the van. "It's clear of bodies, sir!" He told Patterson.</p><p>"Okay.  Any friendlies among the dead?" the officer asked.</p><p>"I  don't recognize any of the parts, but that doesn't mean much," Stevenson  said.</p><p>"I  see something at the edge the woods!" Jenkins remarked. She narrowed her  eyes and looked past the two succubae corpses in front of it.</p><p>"That's  the direction Miss Saotome is in," Morrison said after checking his  scanner.</p><p>"Let's  go!" Patterson said before leading his team towards the woods. "We're  going in, estimate ETA on further backup?" he asked into his headset.</p><p>"Sir,  it looks like Kowalski," Jenkins said as she rolled over the male body. It  being male was the clearest indicator of who it was further confirmation would  require either a DNA test or fingerprinting.</p><p>"<i>What</i> took you guys so long?" Akane  demanded as she dropped to the ground. The agents turned to her but immediately  lowered their weapons.</p><p>"We  got into the helicopter as soon as we got the call, I'm sorry. Any other  casualties?" Patterson stated doing his best to ignore the <i>meat</i> that the blue haired demon was  eating.</p><p>"Not  anymore," Nariko quietly said as she wiped some blood off the corner of  her mouth.</p><p>"Where's  Miss Saotome?" Patterson asked.</p><p>Akane  turned and started to walk back while Nariko made a motion for him to follow.</p><p>"You  three secure the area," the officer told his mean before following the two  demons. Stepping over some demon bodies he quickly reached them. The redheaded  demon was sitting on the ground protectively cradling the defector with her  wings and arms.</p><p>"Ucchan,  it's time to go," Sailor DarkStar said trying to wake the girl up.</p><p>The  platinum blonde-haired succubus stirred and nuzzled closer to her mother, while  mumbling the word Mommy</p><p>"Uhh... gimmie a moment,"  DarkStar said a slight blush rising on her face.</p><p>End Chapter 10</p><p>Author's Notes: Thanks goes to my  prereaders for enduring my mistakes and making this story better: Jerry Starfire, Black Dragon, Joe Fenton, Wray Loflin, Kevin D.
