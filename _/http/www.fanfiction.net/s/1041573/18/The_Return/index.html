</div><p>Girl Talk</p><p>A Ranma Sailor Moon fic thingy.</p><p>By Josh Temple and Trimatter</p><p>Naturally, I own neither Sailor Moon nor Ranma. So here's the  disclaimer</p><p>Ranma 1/2 and its characters and settings belong to Rumiko  Takahashi, Shogakukan, Kitty, and Viz Video. Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon  belongs to Naoko Takeuchi, Koudansha, TV Asahi, and Toei Douga, and DIC.</p><p>Previous chapters and other works can be found at our   fanfiction websites.</p><p>Other website Temple of Ranma's Senshi Seifuku</p><p>C&amp;C as always is wanted.</p><p>Yes this is another co-writer project between both Sunny and  Trimatter. That should be all the warning you need.</p><p>Ranma's bare feet padded along the wooden floor as she danced in a  kata, one that she used to help clear her mind when she was troubled. She found  great comfort in the familiar movements of the art, like a child with a  favorite stuffed animal or blanket would. Whenever something bothered,  disturbed, or just preoccupied her mind, she had found solace in the complex  forms of the art.</p><p>The only problem was that it wasn't working this time.</p><p><i>"Damn it, why in the hell did I do something so  stupid?"</i> She groused to herself. <i>"The past was dead and  gone... then Nabiki had to spot me and bring it all back."</i></p><p>Stopping her exercise, she glanced at a clock that rested on a low  bookshelf. Sighing heavily, she wiped the sweat from her brow.<i> "I have  five and a half hours to decide whether or not I'm going,"</i> she  mentally noted. <i>"Damn, I wish Tenchi could be here right </i></p><p>Standing and trying to sort through her mixed emotions turned into  a battle between keeping a promise and letting go of the past. Shaking her  head, Ranma returned to the kata only to stop a short time later. She looked  out the window into the darkness of early morning.</p><p>"It's no good," she concluded. "I can't stop  thinking about what to do." She cocked her head to one side and made a  contemplative smirk on her face. "I'll think I'll go for a  walk."</p><p>Transforming into her Senshi form gently as to not alarm Tenchi,  who could sense her now for some reason, she summoned her sword and paused.  "<i>"Where to go? Hmmm... doesn't matter, as long as it's  daylight." </i></p><p>With a shrug of her shoulders, Ranma - now Sailor Sun - sliced a  long line into the air, reached in with the tip of the sword, and randomly  picked a nearby universe. It was something she had only done a few times,  mostly driven out of curiosity as to what was there in the multitude of  different universes. Also the excitement of going to a completely alien  universe and what might be found there was like opening a Christmas present –  she never knew what she was going to find.</p><p>Ranma consciously picked a universe not too far removed from her  own. She didn't want to deal with anything too weird because she needed to  think. And right now an alien, yet familiar, setting would do the trick.</p><p>She used to do that with the myriad of small cafes and tea houses  in the surrounding area, but lately it was harder to get privacy since the news  of her pregnancy got out among her many friends. Ranma needed to think and  "baby clothes shopping" was not going to solve the problem of her  past coming up and smacking her in the face. She could have picked any point in  the world to go to, but it was just as easy to move between dimensions as it  was to move from one point to the next, so why not?</p><p>Poking her head slightly through the newly made opening, she  looked around to make sure that the coast was clear. Ranma did not really need to do that for her powerful senses had  already told her that it was safe, but it was a force of habit that she could not break. She looked around the new world - and  smiled.</p><p><i>"An alley," </i>she mused to herself with a slight  smirk. <i>"It's always an alley."</i></p><p>Stepping completely through, her form wavered as her Senshi  uniform changed into a nice, ordinary blue skirt while her top changed into a  pale pink, button-up shirt. She was still in her Senshi form, but it was now  disguised from the eyes of anyone who looked at her. Even though she never had  any problems when she went "exploring", Ranma didn't want to take any  chances - especially in her condition.</p><p>Walking out of the alleyway into the bright sun, the first thing  she realized that she wasn't in Japan.<i> "Hmmm... well, all the better. I  didn't want to see anyone I might even vaguely know anyway,"</i> she  thought flippantly. <i>"This is not too far removed from my home universe,  so I should be able to find some decent tea somewhere."</i></p><p>"Yeah, what do you want?" Ranma asked as she looked up  from her breakfast in the Company commissary. She had been discussing <i>things</i>  with her mother. It had been a depressing morning. Ironically, her father was  one of the people trying to warn her about the problems with Kasumi. It seemed  that she was the only one to not see it coming. Ranma took some comfort in her father's  tacit acceptance of her and his earnest, albeit clumsy,attempts to help.</p><p>"We've got a favor to ask you," Colonel Jacob Edwards  stated as he sat down next to her. He noticed the demon's tear-stained face.  This breakup could be troubling, but he knew both parties were professionals.  That would mitigate things.</p><p>The demon eyed the officer. Part of her expected the other shoe to  drop; that they would finally ask for something she would not do.  "What?" She looked over to see her mother stiffen.</p><p>"Twenty minutes ago we detected a spike in Hamilton."  Jacob said, talking about the small city to the south of Toronto and at the  Southern end of lake Ontario.</p><p>"What kind, Sir?" Major Saotome asked as she removed an  arm from around her daughter.</p><p>"It was a teleport. Pattern Silver. More powerful than  normal."</p><p>"What's the big deal? Setsuna can do that, and so can Usagi  with her friends." Ranma was still alert. Jacob's presence for what looked  like a minor thing meant something.</p><p>"The Tokyo section just reported in and all of the Pattern  Silvers are accounted for."</p><p>"You're thinking it's another Virgo? Or is Mercury setting a  trap like the Assembly's?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"That sounds a bit beneath her. She's not likely to sacrifice  Virgo quite yet," Jacob said with no indication of humor.</p><p>Nodoka paused wondering if her boss had tried to crack a joke,  which seemed as unlikely as him cracking a smile.</p><p>"But we have to consider the possibility," Jacob  continued.</p><p>"Doesn't sound like her style anyway,"  Ranma shook her head. "They're just rebelling. Look at them, they're  dressing in black and getting tattoos. Classic teenager. So, what do you want  me to do?"</p><p>"If it's a new Senshi. We'd like you to be our greeter,"  Jacob smiled.</p><p>"Yeah... I don't know if some unknown magical girl would  react best to a demon."</p><p>"You're better than one of us."</p><p>"Not sending backup with me?"</p><p>"Of course, I am." Jacob clarified. "But you'll do  the talking, one magical girl to another."</p><p>"So we've got some unknown Pattern Silver. What's her  strength?"</p><p>"That's why we're sending you. Our scanners... the first  spike, though brief, was  powerful," Jacob continued in a more serious tone.</p><p>Ranma sat and  digested that tidbit for a moment. Something that big  coming through and she missed it. Being busy trying to deal with breaking up with Kasumi did that.</p><p>"After the initial spike, the power faded to a more sane  level. Then we had a helicopter try and get closer and triangulate the Silver's  location, but it faded by then." Jacob knew that Hilbert would be flying  cautiously. "Now, unlike your Grandma, this visitor didn't break anything,  but BlackSky can mask herself completely." He then went on to give a  description of the recorded harmonics.</p><p>"I suppose the analysis on BlackSky's signature paid  off," Nodoka proposed. Though she did remember that BlackSky's arrival was  undetected and she only melted those scanners when she showed off to  Ranma.</p><p>"Lovely," Ranma sighed. "So she could be anything.  What about my kids?"</p><p>"That's up to you. Though I feel a gaggle of demonic spawn  might upset her. "</p><p>"And if she's hostile?"</p><p>"Then you can blow off some steam."</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow. "You're not worried about my  emotional state?"</p><p>"No. I thought work would help distract your mind." Jacob's  tone was its normal flat self, but a hint of something else slipped out.</p><p>Ranma shook her head at the agent's sympathy. "Just as long  as Kasumi's not on my backup detail."</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"Have a helicopter on the base ready for my kids," Ranma  said as she pulled out her Company cell phone.</p><p>"What about the Inners?"</p><p>Ranma paused. She remembered Usagi soaked with her victim's blood  and vengeance in her eyes. The memory then shifted to the hug with that sad  blonde in the leather shop. "No... Usagi's got too much on her hands right  now. Not with Ami and all."</p><p>"Fine. Your helicopter's on the roof. You'll rendezvous with  a team of plainclothes agents and a detachment of battle-dress troopers, that  were already dispatched."</p><p>"Do they have a lock on the Senshi's location?" Ranma  asked as she got up.</p><p>"A general area," Jacob confessed.</p><p>Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Good luck Dear. Remember she might just be lost, confused,  and new to this."</p><p>"If she is, I'll send her right over to the inners. Unless  she'd rather work with professionals," Ranma grinned.</p><p>"The Silver must have powered down after she  teleported." Jacob added as they walked to the elevator bank.</p><p>"I can find her easily enough." Ranma stepped into the  elevator. After passing out of security and entering the main lobby of the  Toronto Trust tower she was then led to another elevator that took her to the  roof and the waiting WIC Blackhawk.</p><p>When she first strolled along the streets, Ranma thought she was  in the United States, but that was quickly proven wrong as she spied some signs  in French as well as English dotted here and there. Curious, she investigated  discreetly and discovered herself to be in Hamilton, Canada. Not only was she  in a different universe and a different part of the globe than she was used to,  Ranma found herself in the past relative to her universe; six years in the past  to be exact. Satisfied where on the globe and when she was, she made her way to  the first place that looked like it might have some decent tea.</p><p>Seating herself near the large window, Ranma relaxed and took in  the atmosphere of the coffee house. She watched as people walked by, some  hurrying, others more casual in their pace and smiled at the wonder of it all.  Smiling at the server who brought a steaming cup of tea to her table, Ranma  fished out a handful of change to pay. <i>"Heh - good thing I can use my  senses to find spare change that others drop</i>," she mused. <i>"It's  best to pay for everything using the local currency."</i></p><p>Seeing that the tea was literally steaming hot, she placed it  aside to cool a bit and returned to watching the world go by. It was quiet and  she was the only person in the cafe at this time of the morning and that was  fine with her.</p><p><i>"What to do, what to do?" </i>She pondered. <i>"One  part of me says 'screw it' and another part says 'give them a chance'. Gah, I  thought I was over all this."</i></p><p>During the ride Ranma made another short call to Nariko and got  another briefing, but the majority of the time was spent brooding. The redhead  did not even really notice that this was the first time she had been in a  helicopter since the forest fight. Part of her was relieved that there were  just the two pilots in addition to herself in the vehicle. She did not think  she was asking too much of a commitment from Kasumi. They were engaged after  all. She had not even asked or suggested that Kasumi change. Ranma knew  Kasumi's stance on that.</p><p>It was disheartening. For both her sisters Kasumi chose demonhood  over death. That Ranma could not understand Kasumi's decision made things  worse. Almost as worse was when Ranma started crying about how her mate was  leaving her. Kasumi did not react well to that word's use. Ranma was relieved  when the helicopter safely landed on a hospital helipad in Hamilton. WIC was  making sure to keep the helicopter at a distance from the area where the suspected Silver was.  Anything to distract her from the breakup.</p><p>"Jarvis?" Ranma asked as she jumped off the helicopter.  She looked the agent over. "Well, it's nice to know you can wear something  other than your uniform."</p><p>"This practically is a uniform," Jarvis said as he  fingered his button-down shirt. Business casual was the standard dress for  plainclothes agents. "And you're impeccably dressed as always. We're not exactly  sure where the Silver is, but the rough bearings we got put her  somewhere-"</p><p>"Don't tell me," Ranma said as she closed her eyes and  expanded her senses. There was a faint trace of... something, but a trace was  all she needed. "She's that way," the demon stated pointing to the  South-west.</p><p>"Want a lift? It is daylight."</p><p>"Sure, but only to just a few blocks near her. It'll give you  guys a chance to do your thing too."</p><p>"Fair enough." Jarvis nodded. The two walked to the  waiting van. "How are you holding up, Red?" he asked after the van  had pulled away from the hospital and traveled several blocks.</p><p>"Wow, news travels fast," Ranma grumbled as she watched  buildings pass by.</p><p>"Especially among secret agents."</p><p>"Yeah, I'm okay. I guess... I dunno. I thought she  was..."</p><p>"What? The One? Don't kid me, I saw you two. You were a  couple but never an item."</p><p>"Let's just do this," Ranma stated flatly. She ordered  the van to stop. They were close enough.</p><p>"Right," Jarvis relented. He closed the sliding door  after she got out and the van drove off.</p><p>Ranma shook her head and started walking down the sidewalk. It was  a brisk day. She wore a jacket but more to fit in and for style than out of any  need. The scent she followed was definitely that of a Pattern Silver, but not  any that Ranma knew. It was definitely a new Senshi.</p><p>She quickly closed in on the location, and soon enough only a  large window separated her from her quarry. Before entering, Ranma called in  her status. She knew the agents would want to start to set up.</p><p>Scrunching her mouth up in thought, Ranma didn't bother to note  the customers as they entered and left the shop, jiggling the bell that hung  over the door. Pondering the problem of revisiting her past like she promised or  moving on with her life. Ranma sat, pondered, and took an occasional sip of her  now much cooled tea. Ranma knew that you could only be angry so long before  letting it go, but six years was a long time... but maybe not long enough.</p><p>Ranma was literally in a universe where no one knew her, so she  was not expecting anything to intrude into her thoughts or for anyone to bother  her. That's why she was surprised when someone addressed her.</p><p>Ranma smiled as she entered the coffee and tea shop. At least a  bunch of agents dressed like yuppies would not stand out here. They would fit  in well with... well... the cafe was currently empty of patrons save one.</p><p>She studied the lone woman. She had bright red hair that was long  and loose and, although sitting, it was obvious that she was a couple inches  taller than Ranma. She looked to be in her early twenties and was dressed in a  pale, light pink button-up shirt with a blue thigh-length skirt. It was  something that Nariko or Nabiki would wear... or try to get their mom to  wear.</p><p>Ranma smiled. An outfit like that would look good on her, but it  was not her style. She went back to looking over the Senshi. There was an odd  sensation from her - Ranma could not shake it. She seemed to be in deep troubled  thought.</p><p>With a shrug Ranma went for it. This was the Senshi, and she  looked preoccupied with something.</p><p>"Visiting or lost?" She asked, sliding in front of the  woman's view. She was leaning towards lost.</p><p>As the Senshi paused and looked at Ranma, the demon made her own  observations. Her senses confirmed that this was a Sailor Senshi, but not much  on power levels. The Senshi was clearly masking her abilities, and doing it  well enough. Ranma was reminded of her grandmother. Though BlackSky could do  more than merely mask her power. BlackSky could conceal any indication that she  was even masking anything.</p><p>"Visiting or lost?"</p><p>Shaken from her thoughts, Ranma looked up at a - biker chick? The  woman who spoke stood over her wearing leather - nothing but leather. Leather  bodice, leather jacket, elbow length leather fingerless gloves, leather  thigh-high boots, and a short leather skirt - all of it form-fitting like a  second skin. Ranma wondered how many cows had gone into creating the  outfit.</p><p>Of the woman herself, she had alabaster skin, deep red hair,  purple eyes that were penetrating, and for a second what looked like horns or  something appeared on her head. When Ranma looked again she saw that it was  just a trick of the light on the teased shape of the strange woman's hair.  Ranma's eyes widened at the hair. It was a rich and full mass that tumbled down  and had a character all it's own.</p><p>The strange woman stared down at the still seated Ranma as if  trying to bore into her. What made Ranma feel slightly ill-at-ease was that the  leather-clad woman seemed vaguely familiar</p><p>"Excuse me?" Ranma asked cautiously, masking her  surprise at being caught off guard. "I think you have the wrong  person."</p><p>The standing woman then gracefully slid into the chair off to  Ranma's right and looked into Ranma's eyes, almost as if she were trying to  find something. She then leaned forward slightly and sniffed the air. She then  cocked her head to one side, never breaking eye contact with Ranma, and seemed  confused by something.</p><p>"No mistake," the leather-dressed woman said in a voice  that was slightly musical. "You're not from around here."</p><p>Ranma blink-blinked at the strange woman. In the back of her head,  alarms were going off. Her ever-present tactical thinking was already devising  several defensive measures as well as escape routes, plus she had  subconsciously raised the level of her shielding. Something was very wrong with  her table companion.</p><p>"Excuse me?" The Senshi asked. Her face masked her  surprise, but her scent gave it away. "I think you have the wrong  person."</p><p>Ranma sat down and took a more detailed look. There was something  familiar about the Senshi's <i>scent</i> too. Not her power, per say but  something more basic. Something fundamental. She was human, or as human as a Pattern  Silver could be. Ranma made eye contact and kept it; she wanted to show  respect. This Senshi had to have some power, but more importantly she had to  have skill. The scale of both quantities was completely unknown.</p><p>"No mistake," Ranma lilted. "You're not from around  here."</p><p>Ranma noted the Senshi's blinking. She was surprised? Did she  think she could set  off every detector within fifty miles  and no one would notice? A new Senshi showing up was pretty obvious. Again  Ranma thought of her grandmother. BlackSky teleported from another plane. Maybe  this Senshi really was lost.</p><p>"I'm just passing through," the Senshi stated, in an  almost embarrassed tone. "This is my first time through here."</p><p>Ranma leaned back and smiled triumphantly. She was right. Before  she could ask her questions her companion spoke.</p><p>"You're a demon," the Senshi  said in a measured voice.</p><p>Ranma blinked. It looked like the Senshi was making observations  of her own.</p><p>"I'm just passing through," Ranma admitted evenly as information  was being fed into her consciousness about the nature of the biker-chick seated  next to her. The findings were alarming. "This is my first time through  here."</p><p>As if picking up on the changing mood of the redhead, the  biker-chick leaned away and smiled in a most disarming way - revealing her  extra long canines. This action had the effect of making the alarm bells in  Ranma's head blare louder as she stared at what she knew was some type of  demon. The tactical part of her mind kicked in as she developed several  different attack options and raised the level of her shielding even more.</p><p>"You're a demon," Ranma stated flatly.</p><p>Both women were wrapped in a blanket of silence as each seemed to  size up the other.</p><p>"Yes," the demon agreed in a tone that was better suited  to a comment about the weather. "That all you can see about me?" she  asked, almost disappointed.</p><p>The redhead paused and looked over the biker-demon again. It was  true that she was not making any threatening moves, but there was something  else. Something unsettling.</p><p>"I guess we'll start simple," the leather-clad demon  began. "Who are you, why are you here, what Senshi are you?"</p><p>The redhead's skin turned almost as pale as her demonic  companion's at being discovered. "How did you know?" Behind the eyes  of the redhead, senses started to feed additional information that was gleaned  from the demon. Patterns within patterns, ones that were very familiar and  alien mixed together.</p><p>"My god... you're a Senshi too," the redhead said as  she tried to wrap her mind around the idea of a demonic senshi. The redhead's  eyes seemed to burrow into the demon's as if looking for something of their  own.</p><p>"Isn't being a Senshi supposed to be a good thing?" the  demon seemed genuinely confused.</p><p>The redhead's skin turned even paler before a mask of fear crossed  her features. It was obvious that she recalled something unpleasant -   very unpleasant. She suddenly slid back in her chair slightly, the demon also  moved back slightly as she sensed the other's power-up; it was shielded but  directed at her as a definite warning. It was almost overwhelming. "Stay  back!" The redhead said firmly.</p><p>The demon sighed. "I told them I wasn't the best choice for  this mission. Some random Senshi might not react well to a demon. Especially a  pregnant Senshi. A mother's drive to protect is an amazing force." She  seemed to speak from experience. She also hoped that her words would at least  calm the other woman a  bit.</p><p>"You know?" The redhead's eyes narrowed as she  maintained her guard.</p><p>"One mother can spot it easily enough in another," the  demon noted absently. She frowned. "I guess you're not going to answer.  Least you're being civil." She then ordered some tea of her own.</p><p>"So are you, I've never heard of demons being well-mannered,"  the redhead replied somewhat evenly.</p><p>"You've never met my eldest." The demon smiled fondly.  "She's such a sweet and gentle girl."</p><p>"Sweet and gentle?" The redhead repeated. "In a  demon?"</p><p>The demon's piercing gaze returned. "Is that a problem?"  She asked sharply, hurt in her voice. "I guess you wouldn't think our kind  was capable of that."</p><p>The redhead wore a look of confusion for a second. She was visibly  wrestling with some internal thoughts before her face changed to a neutral  expression. "You're insulted?" The redhead commented softly.</p><p>"Of course." The demon snorted. "You're a bigot.  Maybe to you we're all the same," the demon spat.</p><p>A weird sort of stalemate rose and fell just as quickly. The  redhead's shoulders sagged a bit as she came out of her defensive stance and  relaxed a bit.</p><p>"I'm... er, sorry? I've never really met a demon, not a real  one," the redhead offered with a slight bow to the demon next to her.  "But all the demons that my friends had to face were more interested in  stealing heart crystals or people's life energy than being civil. I'm sorry if  I assumed wrong."</p><p>An uncomfortable quietness fell between the two for a brief  moment.</p><p>"Our reputation does precede us," the demon admitted and  relaxed. "Can you at least tell me your name?"</p><p>The human redhead cocked her head slightly and shrugged her  shoulders. "My name is Ranma. I'm pleased to meet you."</p><p>The demon blinked once. Twice. Three times.  "Ranma?"</p><p>The redhead who claimed the name Ranma looked back at the demon.  "Yes. That's my name. Er, what's yours?"</p><p>The demon smirked, then giggled a giggle that was pleasant to the  ears. "You're not going to believe me, but my name is Ranma."</p><p>After hearing the giggling demon use her own name, Ranma's brain  when into overdrive. <i>"That's why she seemed so familiar!"</i> Her  mind howled. <i>"She's me! Well, a version of me... that is, this  universe's version of me."</i></p><p>It was at that point that the demon named Ranma leaned toward the  redheaded Ranma and took a deep sniff. <i>"Why is she sniffing me like  that?" </i>Ranma thought self-consciously. <i>"I bathed this  morning." </i></p><p>Human-Ranma was slightly taken aback by being sniffed at again and  as discreetly as she could smelled herself to see if she was malodorous.  Finding nothing, she mused that maybe it was just something demons did. Sensing  an awkward silence building, demon-Ranma felt the need to break it before it  began.</p><p>"Your smell... your underlying smell, is just like  mine," The demon-Ranma said. "You weren't kidding when you said you  were Ranma."</p><p><i>"She was smelling me out - literally,"</i>  human-Ranma mentally concluded. She swallowed a bit before nervously asking,  "So... what are you a Senshi of?"</p><p>"I'm Sailor DarkStar," demon-Ranma  quietly replied. "You?"</p><p>"Sailor Sun," human-Ranma replied, with a note of  pride.</p><p>"Oh... that's ironic," DarkStar laughed.</p><p>"What?" Sun asked.</p><p>"I go to school under the name Sunshine." DarkStar  replied.</p><p>"I - see," Sun said with some hesitant sympathy in her  voice. "Er, why did you pick that as an alias?"</p><p>"Don't ask. It was the Drake's idea," DarkStar  dismissed.</p><p>Sun blinked a few times before  speaking. "Okay."</p><p>"It's okay. It could be worse, somehow," DarkStar  sighed. "So, back to my first question, vacation or lost? Does it have to  do with your baby? If you're running from something, we can help."</p><p>"Thanks, but I'm okay. I was just visiting." Sun  assured. She studied the demon. DarkStar's concern seemed genuine. Sun then  remembered something DarkStar had let slip. "You're a mother  too?"</p><p>DarkStar's face brightened. "Yes, I have five  daughters."</p><p>Sun looked over her doppelganger's frame. She noticed the curves  that were hugged by the tight leather outfit and for some reason wondered how  Ryoko would look in it. There seemed to be advantages to having a demonic body.  "Five kids?"</p><p>DarkStar paused to thank the waitress who served her tea. She  nodded affirmatively while taking a sip of her drink. "I have a seventeen  year old, three sixteen year olds, and one that's now fourteen."</p><p>Sun looked the demon over again and found that it was hard to tell  her exact age. That was common enough Sun knew girls in college that could pass  for junior high. "Er, how old are you?"</p><p>"In this life... sixteen," DarkStar answered while  placing her cup on the coaster. "But a couple records have me around  thirty." She paused and regarded Sun a moment. "So is this your first  child?" DarkStar asked as she smiled warmly and sipped at her tea.</p><p>Sun blinked at the eager inquisitiveness and paused at the thought  of five teenage daughters before answering. The strangeness in DarkStar's age  was noted for later. "Yes, this is my first," She replied, happy that  things were still civil, but things seemed to be getting stranger and stranger.  In spite of the more relaxed attitude that fell between the two, Sun still  maintained some of her defenses.</p><p>Sun wondered if DarkStar was doing something similar. She could  sense the demonic energies her double was giving off but had no idea if they  were hostile or normal. DarkStar was maintaining an engaged posture, especially  with the near constant eye contact.</p><p>DarkStar nodded. "You'll love being a mother. It changes  everything, but it's worth it." She paused and took another sip of her  drink. "So... if you're not lost, why are you here?"</p><p>Sun fidgeted uncomfortably. "I wanted some privacy, to think  things over."</p><p>DarkStar's eyes suddenly narrowed. "It's not about your baby  is it? Is something wrong?"</p><p>"What?" Sun was again shocked  to see the concern and empathy on the demon's face. "No, no... the baby's  fine. I'm worried about something else."</p><p>"Good. Sorry, I was just worried that you might be thinking  of something... drastic." DarkStar bowed her head.</p><p>Another bout of silence revisited the pair as each seem to size up  their thoughts.</p><p>"I was just trying to decide if I did a stupid thing or  not," Sun said. "I said that I would... meet some people and I think  I've pretty much decided not to. They're not worth it."</p><p>DarkStar cocked her head in curiosity. This was not unnoticed by  Sun.</p><p>"A few days ago I ran into someone from my past that I'd  rather not have," Sun clarified. "For some stupid reason I told her  to get everyone from... my past together. I'm supposed to meet them in,"  Sun glanced at her watch, "four and a half hours, but I think I'll just  forget it."</p><p>"Why is this a problem?"</p><p>Ranma looked down on the table top. She fidgeted and swallowed.  "These are the people that... basically stabbed me in the back six years  ago. The only reason why I even thought of going was because Nabiki said my  mother missed me - but now - I don't know now if I should have believed  her."</p><p>"Your mother?" DarkStar asked, puzzled. "What's she  do? Sell you off to Genma?"</p><p>"Worse. She gave me up to... Genma," Sun spat the name  out like a curse word. "Then I come to find that if I didn't return as a  man among men she would kill me."</p><p>DarkStar looked at the young woman seated next to her. "Man  among men?"</p><p>Sun looked up at the demon and shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>"You started out as a guy too?" DarkStar asked.</p><p>Sun nodded, then stopped and looked at DarkStar. "You  too?" DarkStar nodded, taking another sip of her drink. "I guess it  just runs in the universes," Sun quipped. Both Ranmas giggled at the small  joke that seemed to break the ice slightly between them. Each settled more  comfortably into their chairs.</p><p>"So... what's this about your mother?" DarkStar asked  curiously.</p><p>Sun sighed. "It's like... stupid Genma, he made mom a promise  that if I didn't turn out to be a man among men, we would both kill  ourselves."</p><p>Sun watched the demon closely as she thought over what was said.  In spite of the differences there were somethings that were eerily similar to  herself. It made her feel creepy in an excited way. DarkStar gave Sun a gentle  look and smiled. "Come on, your mother wouldn't do that, not make you kill  yourself."</p><p>Sun sighed and nodded. "Yeah, she would... well she can't  anymore. I'm not a Saotome - haven't been one for years," Sun explained.  "The only time I saw her I was a girl at the time and she didn't know it  was me. Anytime anyone even suggested that I was unmanly, she would pull out  that damn sword of hers and wave it around."</p><p>"She was serious, and a sword?" DarkStar asked with  surprise.</p><p>Sun nodded as she took a calming sip of her tea. "Yes - she  was," she said placing her cup down. "She seemed nice enough, but  what kind of mother holds their child - especially a five year old - to  something like that?" Sun grabbed at her tea and took another calming  drink. "Well, since I'm not a Saotome anymore, she could take that suicide  pact and shove it."</p><p>DarkStar sat there and quietly pondered the other Ranma's plight.  Her own mother had made mistakes like that, and DarkStar had failed Nariko in  an even more damaging way...</p><p>The pause also gave Sun the opportunity to collect herself a bit -  this was obviously an emotionally charged subject.</p><p>"Well, you're no longer a Saotome so she can't do anything to  you," DarkStar pointed out. "Why let it get to you?"</p><p>Sun sat in silence for a moment, then shrugged her  shoulders.</p><p>DarkStar sighed and took Sun's hands in hers. Sun found the touch  surprisingly warm. "You said something about a Nabiki saying something  about your mother missing you?" DarkStar asked.</p><p>"Yeah..." Sun said softly. "But knowing the middle  Tendo, she'd think of this as a cruel joke to pull or just to make money from.  Bitch."</p><p>DarkStar looked puzzled, but did not immediately say anything. She  gave Sun a gentle squeeze of the hand. "Nabiki Tendo? You have one too? I  know she... well I mean, my - Nabiki wouldn't."</p><p>Sun sighed again as her shoulders sagged. "I don't know  really anymore," she admitted. "If this was six years ago I would  say: Yes she would, in a heartbeat. But now? I really don't know." Then  she added softly, "She really did seemed changed, though."</p><p>"Well, your mother can't touch you, and Nabiki - your Nabiki  - can't hurt you," DarkStar said. "So why don't you go? You have  nothing to lose and you might gain something."</p><p>"That's not the point!" Sun shot out, gripping  DarkStar's hands a little firmer, but not painfully, with her own. "A  mother is supposed to put the well-being of her child over hers or anyone  else's. She failed. I might not have my child in my arms yet, but I already  know that I will be dead and cold in the ground before anything gets between me  and my child."</p><p>DarkStar smiled in approval. This one will make a good  mother.</p><p>"From what I see here, you'll make a wonderful mother, "  DarkStar said, echoing her thoughts. "So you're here to work out some  personal problems?"</p><p>"Yeah, I guess you can put it that way," Sun said softly  as she looked out the window.</p><p>"Why here? I mean, why bother crossing universes?"  DarkStar could accept crossing plans of existence to visit family, but not just  to find a quiet place to think.</p><p>Sun shrugged her shoulders. "Coming here is just as easy as  crossing the street for me," she replied. "Also it's kind of exciting  - I was hoping to take my mind off things for a bit before really thinking  about it. Back home all my friends would want to do is talk about the baby and  I wouldn't get anywhere with my problem."</p><p>DarkStar seemed to weigh that. She hadn't detected anything but  honesty, a guarded honesty, but honesty none-the-less. DarkStar nodded.  "So what do you know about your mother?" She asked, picking up the  conversation.</p><p>Sun leaned back in her chair and pondered a moment before her face  hardened. "My mother is a sword wielding psycho with an unhealthy fixation  on manliness." She paused and looked out the window again. "She can  go to hell for all I care."</p><p>DarkStar studied the human version of herself; in spite of the  differences, she picked up on the underlying problem.  "You know, I was just as scared about seeing my mother as you are.  Especially since she's a demon hunter, but... I'm glad I did."</p><p>"I'm not scared," Sun defended herself. "There may  be a lot of stuff that scares me and this is not one of them."</p><p>DarkStar gave Sun a measured look as she sipped at her drink.  "You're lying."</p><p>Sun looked at DarkStar with wide eyes before narrowing them.  "I am not!" She said defiantly. "Nabiki said that she wanted to  see me curse or no, but knowing Nabiki..."</p><p>"You're afraid of rejection," DarkStar said pointedly.  "It's written all over your face."</p><p>Sun looked at the tabletop between them, but remained silent.</p><p>"Look," DarkStar said while taking Sun's hands once  again into her own, "Rejection - it happens, but if you don't risk  anything..."</p><p>Sun still examined the tabletop and let the demon massage her  hands. After a brief moment, she sighed heavily. Looking up she noticed a pain  in DarkStar's eyes that wasn't there before. "The voice of  experience?" She quipped with a half-sad tone in her voice.</p><p>It was DarkStar's turn to study the table top. "Yeah.  Actually it is," she said sadly. "I just... just broke up with my  fiancee." Technically, it was Kasumi that did the breaking up.</p><p>Sun opened her mouth, but nothing came out. She tried again with  success. "I'm so sorry," she said sympathetically. "Here I am  telling you my problems and here you are in pain too."</p><p>"Thanks," DarkStar said with a sniffle and a brave  smile. "I thought that she was the one, you know?... she didn't... she...  didn't want to lose her humanity. I didn't even ask her for that, but she  got... scared." Tears started to leak from the corners of the  brokenhearted demon's eyes.</p><p>Sun slid off her chair and squatted next to the still seated demon  and embraced her. The demon stiffened in surprise at the physical contact but  then went with the hug. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," Sun repeated while  hugging her with one hand and handing DarkStar paper napkins with the other.  DarkStar accepted and began using them.</p><p>"I thought she was the one, you know?" DarkStar repeated  through bouts of sniffles. "I mean I was good enough to be a mother to her  sisters, but... but..." DarkStar fell into another bout of tears, burying  her face in a mass of napkins. Sun began rocking the distraught girl  gently.</p><p>"I guess I was good for a lay... but not for a  commitment," the crying demon mewled into Sun's shoulder. Sun drew DarkStar  further into the hug and continued to rock her gently and rubbing her back.  Being unsure of what to say in this situation, she remained quiet. The two  stayed like that for a long moment before DarkStar came back to herself.  "Sorry," she said wiping her eyes with a damp napkin.</p><p>"Are you going to be okay?" Sun asked as she gently  untangled herself from DarkStar's embrace. It was... odd. One moment this demon  seemed to be the jaded voice of experience, and the next she was crying her  heart out.</p><p>"It's okay," DarkStar said with declining sniffling. She  smiled at the other redhead. "Thank you. I needed that. I normally cry on  my Mom's shoulder. Actually, that's what I was doing before I came down here.  She's helped me though my... changes."</p><p>"It's good that she... understands," Sun allowed while a  tinge of jealousy and depression formed within her.</p><p>"My mom's been great though. She's been such a help. She  helped me realize what my responsibilities were." She paused and cocked  her head, wearing a crooked smile. "If you want... I could... call my  mother. I think she would like to meet you."</p><p>"Sure, I'd like to meet your mom," Sun said while  handing off more napkins to the emotional demon. "I wish I was sure about  mine... Maybe yours could help me with my problem."</p><p>DarkStar smiled widely, but thinly. "Just a sec," she  said as she reached somewhere, pulled out and flipped open her phone then  casually punched a button. "Hello?" Pause. "Everything's fine.  No. Yes. I was just talking about Kasumi - say, could you have my mom come  over?" Pause. "No, but I think she'll want to meet our wayward  Senshi." Pause. "Right." She then folded her phone and replaced  it in a jacket pocket.</p><p>"She's coming? But... you just met me." Sun felt honored  but apprehensive. A bit of hope bloomed within her. After all, if this Nodoka  can accept this Ranma, why not her Nodoka?</p><p>DarkStar "Should I be concerned? You're a Senshi, you're me,  and you're a good mother. You won't be the strangest person she's met,"  DarkStar sipped her tea again. She let her ancient demon queen of a grandmother  meet Nodoka, this alternate her would be fine too.</p><p>"You said she's a demon hunter? What kind?" Sun then  noted that the demon's eye makeup was pristine again.</p><p>"She works for Willard International Consulting. They act  like a scary secret organization. Sunglasses, black helicopters, all that  stuff." DarkStar laughed as she caught the eye of a pair of young  professionals at a nearby table. "But they're really good guys. They fight  monsters and such. Dang professional at it too. They... care."</p><p>"Do you work for them, too?"</p><p>"Yeah, I fight with them, and they've been a big help with my  family." DarkStar's smile turned bittersweet. She sighed and looked at the  table.</p><p>"So what does she do?" Sun asked quickly changing the  subject.</p><p>"She's the head of the Toronto base's Science and Technology  section. Mostly she does armor and weapons. Making them lighter, stronger that  sort of thing. Lots of composites, stuff I don't understand." DarkStar  avoided mentioning any current projects of her mother's.</p><p>A surprised smile formed on Sun's face. "She's a research  scientist?"</p><p>DarkStar paused in recollection. "I guess so. She got her  doctorate in materials science before joining WIC."</p><p>Sun blinked at the overload of information before renewing her  smile. "I just got my degree in chemistry," she said. "I was  thinking about going for a doctorate, but," she paused and rubbed her  stomach, "life had other plans for me."</p><p>"Yeah," DarkStar said absently. "A year ago I never  thought I'd be where I am today."</p><p>Sun gave a nod. "I hear that - hell, six years ago I'd never  imagined I'd be happily married - much less to a guy."</p><p>"How did that come about? I mean you starting as a guy and  ending up a girl?"</p><p>"Difficult," Sun said flatly. "I was  cursed...</p><p>"Jusenkyo?" DarkStar interjected quizzically.</p><p>Sun nodded and continued. "Then I lost a fight and got stuck  as a girl and disowned by Genma."</p><p>DarkStar blinked at the human version of herself. She could almost  see her father doing that. The way he looked at her, when she had first  accepted being a mother... "You mean he disowned you because you got  stuck?"</p><p>Sun shook her head. "Not really," she admitted.  "Because I wouldn't marry Soun to 'join the schools'."</p><p>DarkStar frowned. The more she heard about Sun's Genma the less  she liked. "Marry Soun?" She repeated with a shake of her head. She  would rather marry the Drake. He was a much better parent. "Okay, but how  does that explain how you ended up like you are?"</p><p>Sun looked at the tabletop for an extended moment, lost in  thought. "I - I have no idea how long, but I was living on the streets for  a very long time... a lot of things can change when you're hungry all the time  and digging through dumpsters for something to eat."</p><p>DarkStar easily read from Sun's face that there was still more to  this story.</p><p>"A lot of things change... things that you take for granted.  Hell," Sun continued while looking up with a dismissive a wave of her  hand, "I was so desperate at one point I seriously thought about..."  her voice faded into nothing. She remained quiet for a few heartbeats, her gaze  returning to the tabletop. "I even thought of selling myself," she  said barely above a whisper. "All so I could just have something decent to  eat. That's how far I sank."</p><p>"But you didn't?" It was shameful, but DarkStar knew <i>exactly</i>  what she would have done in that situation, and was pleased that her alternate  was capable of a... nobler path.</p><p>Sun shook her head. "No. If wasn't for Granny finding me when  she did, I just might have," she explained. "Hell, if it wasn't for  her I'd probably be dead."</p><p>"Granny?" DarkStar questioned, thinking about  BlackSky.</p><p>"Yeah," Sun smiled. "She wasn't my real Granny, but  she was more family to me than my own family had ever been. She took me in,  cleaned me up, gave me a job, and finally saw me adopted me into her  clan."</p><p>"She sounds like a wonderful person," DarkStar commented  as she took another sip of her drink, emptying it this time.</p><p>"She was," Sun agreed, the meaning of her words clear.  "In fact," she patted her lower abdomen, " if this is a girl, I  already have a name picked out for her."</p><p>"Keeping the sex a secret?" DarkStar asked with a  smile.</p><p>Sun nodded with a smile of her own. "Yup, I want to be  surprised."</p><p>"I know I love my children," DarkStar said.  "Everything else seems so unimportant compared to them."</p><p>Sun leaned forward. "You wouldn't happen to have any  pictures, would you?"</p><p>DarkStar smiled and reached somewhere in her incredibly tight outfit  and pulled out a hefty photo wallet.</p><p>Across the room, sipping a coffee and pretending to read a  newspaper, agent Morrison watched over the two women. "What are those two  doing now?" he asked his partner, a young women seated beside him.</p><p>Agent Andrea Lytle glanced over her laptop's screen. "It  looks like Sunny is showing pictures of her kids again," she commented  quietly.</p><p>"I wondered if she is going to show the one with Nariko and  Akane with the whip cream and-" he was interrupted by a loud burst of  giggles from the two Ranma's.</p><p>"I would take that as a yes," his table-mate deadpanned,  while pretending to work a spreadsheet.</p><p>"Oh my god, they're adorable," Sun exclaimed gleefully.  "You must have your hands full at times."</p><p>DarkStar beamed at the compliment. "Yes, they're still very  young," she said as she looked at the picture of her family.</p><p>Sun studied the photograph. One face in particular stood out, a  familiar one among others that were slightly less familiar. "Is that...  your mom?" she asked pointing to a lab coat-wearing older woman who stood  behind her daughter with a smile.</p><p>"Yes, that's my mom. She wanted a family picture for the  longest time," DarkStar said as she pulled out a couple more  pictures.</p><p>Sun's attention went from Nodoka to the others in the photo. Some  of them looked familiar, but it had to be a coincidence. "Umm... what are  your kids names?" she delicately asked.</p><p>"Akane, Nariko, Ukyou, Misako, and Nabiki," DarkStar  explained pointing to each of the girls.</p><p>That creepy disconnect feeling returned to Sun. She now knew who  her counterpart had just broken up with, though that meant that... Her eyes  went back to the two demons who were once her fiancee's. "Were... were  they always demons?" Sun asked, knowing the answer.</p><p>DarkStar looked at the still image of her daughters. "No.  They were human, but they got turned." The demon's shoulders sagged.  "It started with saving one person's life... and then it  snowballed."</p><p>"Turning saved their lives?" Sun asked. That fit with  the demon's earlier comments.</p><p>"When I turn someone, their body is remade. Side effect is  that it heals mortal wounds," DarkStar said before ordering another cup of  tea.</p><p>"And since you turned them, you became their mother? That  makes sense. I guess." Sun's eyes returned to the photo, changing like  that... at death's door had to be traumatic, but they looked happy.</p><p>DarkStar's frowned and looked at her photos. One was a picture of  Nariko happily holding a test in one hand and an arm around her mother with the  other. "I wish I had been able to see it that quickly. I... I didn't know  what I was, what my daughter was..." DarkStar's eyes started to tear.  "And it hurt her."</p><p>Sun didn't know exactly what was happened to DarkStar's daughter,  but she did understand that whatever it was, was not good. Sun found herself  hugging and comforting a sniffling, emotionally-charged demon again. The napkin  dispenser got another workout.</p><p>"They're hugging again," Morrison commented as he turned  the page of his newspaper. He reminded himself to find something to give Red,  It was the least he could do: he owed her. "I guess they're getting along.  What do you think they're talking about?"</p><p>Andrea lifted a cup of hot, black coffee to her lips and paused as  she typed a few words into her laptop and looked at the responding feed.  "Looks like plain old girl talk to me."</p><p>Morrison cocked his head toward his partner while keeping the two  Senshi within his peripheral vision. "Girl talk? Are you sure?"</p><p>Andrea looked at her partner through half-lidded eyes.  "Men," she snorted before returning to her laptop.</p><p>"If I only knew then what I know now," DarkStar sobbed a  bit as Sun continued to hold her. "Nariko is special... because of... my  cocky mistake."</p><p>Sun nodded absently as she held and stroked the demon's back. She  understood the price of being cocky. "It couldn't have been that  bad," she said as she held DarkStar. "If your Genma is anything like  mine-"</p><p>"You don't understand," DarkStar interrupted, wailing  into Sun's shoulder. "What I did was worse than anything Pops ever did to  me."</p><p>"You seem like a good person, I don't think-"</p><p>"I pushed her away," DarkStar said into Sun's shoulder.  "I didn't know and I didn't understand and I didn't want her, so I pushed my  child away onto her father... and it hurt her."</p><p>"But if you didn't know and really understand what was going  on," Sun said, trying to comfort the distraught demon. "It seems to  me you're doing the best you can to make right your mistake, so don't beat yourself  up for it."</p><p>"But... but," DarkStar started, before relaxing more  into Sun's embrace. Calming herself somewhat, she began again. "Before  Nariko... I... was in denial. I kept pretending I was still human, still male.  That wouldn't last. I see humans and I know what I can do to them. It's so  easy. They're so fragile... and I know how good it feels." Her mind  flashed to the fight against the Assembly.</p><p>DarkStar looked Sun in the eyes. She was not ready to tell Sun  that experience had proved much of this. That she had happily torn into humans  and feasted on them as they screamed. They were evil, and monsters in their own  right, but... she had still fed and would continue to feed.</p><p>"There was once a time that I wondered if I was human,"  Sun whispered gently into DarkStar's ear. "Knowing that you were created  in a lab - turned into a weapon."</p><p>The two broke apart with their arms still around one another. Both  gazed into each others eyes and found as they found an understanding.  "There's nothing like being turned into a weapon of mass destruction -  being a weapon of mass destruction - that makes you question your  humanity."</p><p>"At least it's still just a question for you. I know the  answer." DarkStar sighed, as she looked at her companion. "You were  created?" DarkStar asked in a voice filled with curiosity.</p><p>"I was -," Sun paused in thought for the right word,  "- turned into a weapon. I was a human before the Techo-mages got a hold  of me. Afterward, it was training, honing my powers for the time that I might  be called upon."</p><p>DarkStar continued to look into Sun's eyes. "Wow, it's almost  like you are - were more inhuman than me," DarkStar said while wiping  stray tears from her eyes. "Sure I'm a demon, but you... you were made to  be a thing. Man that sucks."</p><p>The two shared a quiet moment as their emotions ran down.  Re-seating herself back into her chair, Sun studied her demonic twin. "I  got over that. My husband helps." A smile crept across her face.  "When I'm with Tenchi, I know I'm human. No doubts."</p><p>"You're lucky," DarkStar said sadly. "I thought I  found a mate, but..." she ended with a even sadder sigh.</p><p>Sun took up DarkStar's hands into hers. "You'll find  someone!" she said in a positive tone. "I'm sure of it. It always  happens when you least expect it and you have so much to offer."</p><p>DarkStar gave a weak smile. She was a single mother demon still in  high school with five children. "Thanks. I... I thought Kasumi was the  one. But she... well I can't blame her. She's the last human among the Tendo  sisters."</p><p>Gently squeezing DarkStar's hands, Sun smiler re-assuredly.  "Don't worry, you'll find someone. Trust me."</p><p>DarkStar tilted her head so that she was looking at their joined  hands. "Yeah. If things get too bad, I can just ask - well -Jarvis or some  other agent." She sighed depressively. "One of them would be willing  to take one for the Company."</p><p>Sun opened her mouth in shock at the casualness with which  DarkStar seem to take her love life. She swallowed hard before speaking.  "What about love?"</p><p>DarkStar sighed heavily. "Love is easy for my kind... and it  would keep me sane. I hope it doesn't come to that, but... sometimes life  forces things on you."</p><p>"I know what you mean about life," Sun replies while  nodding. "I know I never asked for any of this, but still... shouldn't  love count for something?"</p><p>"Yes," DarkStar admitted. "But... I-I've had  hopes," she added sadly. In many ways a mating of convenience would be  easier. Biology would take care of the details.</p><p>Sun squeezed DarkStar's hands. "Don't give up then," Sun  implored. "So what if it didn't work out between you and Kasumi? Is there  anyone else that you are interested in? I'm sure there has to be someone that's  caught your eye."</p><p>DarkStar looked uncomfortable. "Yeah. But it's even a longer  shot than-"</p><p>"There you are," a voice called out. "How is  everything?"</p><p>Both Ranmas looked up at the newcomer. She was very familiar to  both of them.</p><p>"Hi Mom," DarkStar said with a smile. "Everything's  fine. We were talking about - stuff."</p><p>"I see," the older redhead said with a warm smile while  eyeing the human-Ranma. "And who do we have here? Our wayward  Senshi?"</p><p>"Um, Mom, I'd like to introduce you to... Ranma,"  DarkStar said a little nervously. "Er, Ranma this is my mom. Um, Mom,  Ranma's from somewhere else."</p><p>"So I gathered," Nodoka said dryly still maintaining her  warm smile as she slid into the seat between the redheads and addressed Sun.  "So, you're just visiting?" she asked with the intention of quickly  breaking the ice.</p><p>DarkStar and Sun looked and each other, then back at the older  woman before bursting into a fit of giggles.</p><p>Morrison cleared his throat slowly. "Look alive,  Andrea," he said out of the corner of his mouth. "It must be more  serious than we thought, look who just showed up."</p><p>Andrea paused in her typing and stretched, using it as cover to  scan the room.</p><p>"Major Saotome brought some reinforcements," Andrea said  as she made like she was looking over some papers by her laptop. "It may  be nothing... I mean the Major's S&amp;T not Operations. They're getting  together like old friends. Stay alert, though - it may be nothing, but we can't  afford to get too comfortable now."</p><p>Morrison grunted a positive response while pretending to work the  crossword. Their job was just to watch and provide support if things went bad.</p><p>Major Saotome raised an eyebrow as she sat down. "You seem in  better spirits dear," she said, putting her hand on her daughters.</p><p>"I've been getting some... perspective." DarkStar  allowed. "This is a me that's from another universe or  something."</p><p>"That could explain the variance in the inter-dim signal we  detected," Nodoka mused as she appraised the other Senshi. The scans that  WIC had taken and were still taking confirmed her Pattern, if not her power.  She was clearly masking her full power and doing it quite well.</p><p>"That's how you found me," Sun thought aloud. "You  picked up my space fold... Hmmm... Washu did say that I could be tracked  through primitive technology. I guess yours was primitive enough, er - no offense."</p><p>"None taken," Nodoka said, brightly. To her being able  to be seen by "primitive" technology was a major oversight. It was  like making a plane invisible to radar and then not bothering masking its  thermal output or giving it a concealing paint job. "So I take it you were  surprised?"</p><p>Sun nodded. "Yes. It's not that often that anyone can find  me."</p><p>"Really?" a much interested Nodoka asked. She was  interested in gathering any information on this new Senshi.</p><p>"Er, when they made me, I was designed to be invisible to  every form of detection," Sun explained, "But what they didn't do was  to bother to test that against, er - 'cruder instruments of detection'. So  while I'm invisible to 'more modern' scanners, more primitive ones can pick me  up on a wide-scale."</p><p>Nodoka nodded in understanding. "It's usually the things that  are considered unimportant that cause trouble later on."</p><p>"It's also arrogant." DarkStar sourly noted.  "Though, those mages or whatever <i>were</i>  playing god."</p><p>"In combat, teleportation is a frightening ability,"  Nodoka noted. Which was why it was an ability she hoped her daughter and  granddaughters would figure out.</p><p>"It's not really teleportation," Sun clarified. "I  don't like doing that - it makes me a little dizzy."</p><p>Nodoka cocked her head. "Then what would you call  it?"</p><p>"Folding space," Sun answered plainly. "I create a  slit in space/time, find a another point in space where I want to go to, fold  the ends together, and then pass through."</p><p>DarkStar thought on Sun's words with a frown on her face. After a  brief moment she asked, "Isn't that the same as teleportation?"</p><p>Sun looked at her other self and cocked her head and reconsidered.  "Well, I guess it could be," she admitted before shrugging her  shoulders and addressing Nodoka. "So you're Ranma's mom? I'm Ranma Masaki,  I'm pleased to met you."</p><p>"I'm Dr. Nodoka Saotome, and I'm also pleased you met you as  well," Nodoka answered. She declined to give her military title. That  might spook the girl. "I understand that you are having family problems?"</p><p>Sun blinked at the older woman. "Er, how do you know about  that?"</p><p>DarkStar looked puzzled at Sun for a moment, before her eyes  widened. "Oh yeah, we're being monitored. You understand, we didn't know  if you were a friendly or not."</p><p>Sun nodded. "I... see. I guess that's understandable, er - I  guess. After all, you know nothing about me."</p><p>The conversation lulled as a waitress came up to the table. Ranma  took the time to study DarkStar's mother. She was dressed in a nice pair of  khakis, blouse, and light jacket and was not carrying the family honor blade  with her. Though it was hidden by the jacket, Sun detected the handgun that  Nodoka was carrying.</p><p>Nodoka absently nodded to Sun's statement as she placed her order  with the waitress. "You two want anything to eat? I hadn't really eaten  much for breakfast."</p><p>"I'll take a slice of pie," DarkStar said. "I  didn't eat much this morning and I'm starting to feel it."</p><p>The waitress wrote the order down and looked expectedly at Sun.  "I'm fine," she said. "I ate."</p><p>The waitress departed with a nod and Nodoka continued where they  left off. "Masaki? Your husband's name?"</p><p>Sun nodded with enthusiasm.</p><p>"How nice. My daughter wants a mate," Nodoka said while  eyeing DarkStar. "You have any pictures?"</p><p>DarkStar's eyes widened in irritation. Her mother could still  sometimes find ways to embarrass her.</p><p>Sun blinked at the question. Not seeing anything wrong with the  request and since DarkStar shared hers, she fished around in her subspace  pocket for a small photo wallet. To the others at the table, it was as if Sun  reached into thin air and extracted the light blue photo album. Sun looked at  it and frowned for a brief second, before shrugging her shoulders. She flipped  to the first page. "This was our wedding," she said as she handed the  small book to DarkStar.</p><p>"Wow," DarkStar commented as she leaned toward Nodoka so  she could see as well. "A western ceremony. You made a beautiful  bride." Both DarkStar and her mother looked at the group picture and noted  the familiar faces of the Senshi.</p><p>"Thank you," Sun said with a slight blush. "That's  my husband, Tenchi, the girl next to me is my sister, the one next to her is  Ryoko," Sun's tone changed with the mention of the name, adding an  affection to it, "then there's Usagi, Ami,... you probably recognize the  rest."</p><p>The two Saotome women nodded as they began flipping through the  book. "Tenchi is a handsome young man," Nodoka commented as they  continued to flip through the book. Though a professional, she found it  fascinating to be seeing so many faces that she knew at a event that happened  universes away.</p><p>DarkStar stopped flipping and lingered over a photo. Nodoka raised  an eyebrow, looked at Sun, then back at the picture. DarkStar then rotated the  book and mimicked the elder Saotome's motions, looking between Sun and the  picture that they were looking at.</p><p>This did not go unnoticed by Sun. "What?" she  asked.</p><p>DarkStar smiled as Nodoka addressed the redhead. "You are  very flexible," she said in a approving manner, "and you seem to  enjoy Shibari very much."</p><p>Sun looked confused for a moment, then her eyes widened. The blue  album! With the wedding <i>and</i> honeymoon pictures! "Eeep!" she  embarrassingly exclaimed as she made a grab for the book in DarkStar's hands.  DarkStar clutched the small book protectively to her chest.</p><p>"Hey! I'm getting ideas here," DarkStar said somewhat  defensively. She then looked down for a quick peek and whispered, "Very  interesting ideas."</p><p>Sun's face turned as red as her hair. "Hee, hee, hee,"  she giggled uncomfortably. "I grabbed the wrong one," she explained.  "I meant to show you the red one. Hee, hee, hee... Can I have those back,  er - please?"</p><p>Sun should have known better than to carry that around... but it  was exciting, fun and kinky at the same the time.</p><p>"Don't worry about it," Nodoka reassured. "Ranma,  my daughter that is, is a succubus. There's nothing to be embarrassed  about."</p><p>"A succ-?" Sun began. Part of her thought that might be  what DarkStar was, but still... "Err.. Um, I'm not quite sure what that  means." Sun did not want to make another faux pause.</p><p>"That means she's a sex demon," Nodoka explained while  DarkStar carefully examined Sun's honeymoon pictures. "She literally  thrives on this, so there is not much that can surprise her." Reading  BlackSky's books to the brood had been quite informative on the nature of that  species.</p><p>"How'd you get your ankles that far back...," DarkStar  muttered absently as she paid special attention to one photo. "... and  tied that way too..."</p><p>Sun's face flushed.</p><p>"So what about your mother?" Nodoka asked, distracting  Sun from her current predicament. "You really should see her."</p><p>"I know," Sun lamented. "But what if Nabiki lied to  me? What if she... hates me."</p><p>"You're her child, why should she hate you?" Nodoka  asked as DarkStar shifted in her chair, ignoring the two other women.</p><p>"Because I'm a girl and pregnant," Sun explained.  "That's about as unmanly as you can get."</p><p>"Unmanly?" Nodoka questioned. She paused to thank the  waitress who placed a slice of pie in front of her and her daughter, who was  now jotting some notes down a napkin. Sun notice this and sweatdropped.  "This-" Nodoka continued while motioning to DarkStar, "-isn't  very manly."</p><p>"Hey!" DarkStar said indignantly. She gave a pretty  little pout directed at her mother as she handed the embarrassing photographs  back to Sun while pocketing her own notes.</p><p>"Well, I'd like to think that she has changed," Sun said  as she quickly stuffed the photo album back into her subspace pocket. "I  guess I'm just getting cold feet."</p><p>"Understandable," Nodoka said after she swallowed a bite  of food. "When was the last time you saw her?"</p><p>Sun thought a moment. "I haven't seen her in about six years,  but she didn't know it was me... so its been... sixteen - seventeen years for  her."</p><p>"So you really have no idea how she is today?" Nodoka  asked pointedly.</p><p>Sun shook her head in admittance. "Only what Nabiki has told  me."</p><p>"So spy on her," Nodoka suggested as she dug into her  pie. "Figure out what she does, how she treats other people. That way  you're not going in blind."</p><p>"Umm... Mom," DarkStar stressed.</p><p>"I can't do that! She's my mom!" Sun objected to  Nodoka's idea.</p><p>"Why not?" Nodoka countered with a wave of her fork.  "You're her daughter."</p><p>Sun opened her mouth to say something, but nothing came out. She  then sighed heavily. "It doesn't matter," she said. "I've only  got," she glanced at her watch, "three hours. I wouldn't have any  time to spy on her even if I wanted too."</p><p>"Give just her the benefit of the doubt then," DarkStar  suggested.</p><p>"It's just that- what kind of mother abandons her  child?" Sun asked. She was dismayed and embarrassed to find both Nodoka  and DarkStar sadly raise their hands. "Oh yeah..." Sun sighed.  "Sorry... about... that..."</p><p>"And it's not like your mom locked and disowned you. How  could she if she never knew who you were?" DarkStar suggested.</p><p>"Yeah, you're right. Setsuna was the one who arranged for me  to get locked," Sun admitted, "and a lot of other... stuff  too..."</p><p>"What?" DarkStar's brow furrowed. "She's not that  evil. Sure, she made me a demon, but that was because of her incompetence. She  wanted me human."</p><p>"Well, it was because I had to be totally female and accept  who I really was, otherwise I couldn't access my Senshi powers. It was also an  emergency at the time," Sun explained. "Setsuna had to break me from  my current life to re-awaken me. It pretty much killed who I was, but brought  back who I am. She did what she felt was necessary."</p><p>Sun notice that her table mates were very quiet, with a glance she  was looking upon their horrified faces. "What?"</p><p>"So she just thought the ends would justify the means? How...  monstrous." Nodoka shook her head.</p><p>"It wasn't that- okay, it was that bad at first, but I'm now  who I was meant to be, what I should have been in the first place," Sun  said. "Besides, I forgave her."</p><p>"You forgave someone that destroyed your life to turn you  into a weapon?" Nodoka was aghast.</p><p>"It's okay, Mom," DarkStar said with a bit of sarcasm.  "Ranma spent a long time living on the streets but eventually she made her  own life, so it worked out in the end. So who cares about the means?" she  added her voice now dripping with sarcasm</p><p>"That's a simplification." Sun glared.</p><p>"I see... let me see if I understand all of this  correctly," Nodoka said while setting her empty plate aside and looking at  Sun with firm eyes. "Setsuna arranged to lock you as a girl and thereby  leading to you being disowned by your father."</p><p>Sun looked at the older woman briefly before nodding.</p><p>"Then you spend lord-knows-how-long living on the streets,  barely living just above the level of an animal," Nodoka continued  unrelentedly. "Destroyed the life you had, just so she could have you back  - as a weapon..."</p><p>Sun looked uncomfortable and showed it by shifting around in her seat.</p><p>"... and after basically making your life hell, breaking you  and remaking you into what she needed - you forgave her?"</p><p>Sun sat, biting her lip and looking like she rather be anywhere  but there. "Well... yeah... basically... kinda...," she finally said.  "But... umm... it's... more complicated... it's... umm..."</p><p>"You forgave Setsuna for her transgressions, yet you can't  forgive your own mother." Nodoka interrupted Sun's stammering while taking  a sip of her coffee.</p><p>Sun's mouth dropped open as she was rendered speechless by the  stinging words of the older Saotome woman. As she mentally grappled, trying to  find a way out of the corner she found herself in, DarkStar reached over with a  dainty hand and casually closed Sun's mouth with a gentle snap.</p><p>"Your capacity for forgiveness is... odd," Nodoka  finished with more than a hint of disapproval.</p><p>"That's different," Sun finally said in a weakly  defensive tone. "It's not that simple! My mother abandoned me! Sure Setsuna  ruined the life I had, but I can't hate her... if... I did... if I  did..."</p><p>"You would have to kill her?" Nodoka asked over the rim  of her raised cup.</p><p>Sun was quiet for what seemed like a long moment before nodding  weakly. She had seen first hand what hate, especially self righteous hate,  could do and how dangerous it was. Hate was not an emotion to be taken  lightly.</p><p>"I don't want to hate." She said as the top of the table  seemed very interesting at the moment. "I saw... I've seen what hate can  do... to someone like me."</p><p>The succubus nervously ran her tongue over her teeth. Among other  things, Alexia had given DarkStar her fill of hate, both Alexia's and her  own.</p><p>The two Saotome women's curiosity was aroused, but they both to  set it aside to concentrate on the matter at hand. "So, are you going to  give your mother at least the chance for forgiveness?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>Sun sighed and her shoulders sagged slightly. "Yes. Yes, I  will," she said lowly. "You're right," she sighed out in defeat.  "If I can forgive Setsuna for what she did to me, I should at least give  my mom the chance."</p><p>Nodoka smiled warmly at the younger woman.</p><p>"And remember, " DarkStar added. "Even if it  doesn't work out, you have friends and family of your own to fall back on.  You're not alone."</p><p>Sun looked across the table at her new... friends? She smiled in  amusement at the thought and nodded. "You're right," she agreed.  "I'm just being a coward about it. I'll go and see her."</p><p>"Good for you," Nodoka chimed as DarkStar smiled broadly.</p><p>The three women sat in companionable silence for a minute, gazing  outside and watching the world go by. The sun was higher in the sky and was now  streaming in through a skylight as well as the windows brightening the interior  of the cafe. Each woman was lost in her own thoughts.</p><p>"So, Ranma tells me you're a scientist," Sun said  breaking the silence before it became awkward. "What do you  do?"</p><p>If Nodoka was alarmed or suspicious of the question, she did not  show it. Instead, she was prepared to answer such things in broad terms.  "When Genma disappeared with Ranma, I joined WIC. This was all after I got  my Doctorate in Materials Science," she said in a conversational tone.  "I do research into developing armor and weapons."</p><p>"What school did you go to?" Sun asked, propping her  head up with her arm braced against the table. She was fascinated with this  version of her mother. The officer was  clearly intelligent, articulate, and very accepting of her demonic daughter.  There was also a grim and pragmatic aspect to her. Sun was reminded of a play  she read in college. Not only was Nodoka aware of the Sword of Damocles, but  she seemed to know exactly how thin the thread holding it up was.</p><p>"Tokyo University," Nodoka answered.</p><p>Sun smiled broadened. "Tokyo U?" she said merrily.  "I just graduated from there not long ago. I got my degree with a major in  chemistry."</p><p>"Really now?" Nodoka said in a somewhat delightful tone.  "How marvelous, how did you do?"</p><p>"Well, I like to say I was the top of my class, but I made a  few mistakes here and there and ended up fifth in my class in my major,"  Sun replied. "You know what was really cool? I was - well with my powers,  I was able to see the chemical interactions on a molecular level. It was so  cool!"</p><p>Nodoka smiled as she finished taking a sip of coffee. "One of  the things I'm finding pleasure in is the challenge of making materials that  resist energy claws." She was also designing demon-specific weapons both  bladed and ranged, but her guest need not know that.</p><p>DarkStar's eyes started to glaze over as boredom started to set  in. She would be more interested if her mother was talking about weapons for  her daughters, that was always interesting . The brood mother idly wondered if  she could get that photo album back from Sun.</p><p>"Energy claws?" Sun mused aloud. "Unfortunately,  the only way to have matter that's resistant to energy is to either have it  dense enough," Sun paused as she thought over the problem more, "or  if the atomic binding between the molecules is being reinforced by another  energy field."</p><p>"Look at it from a logistics standpoint," Nodoka said  thoughtfully. "Armor that is dense enough to resist energy claws would be  too heavy to carry. You could rely on an energy field to make lighter armor as  strong as heavier ones, but - well... batteries are finite and it wouldn't do  to have dead batteries in a combat situation." And WIC troopers carried  enough electronic equipment already.</p><p>DarkStar's boredom was complete as she stared off into space,  looking out into the street through the window, but not really seeing anything.  The two older women continued to "talk shop".</p><p>"If the armor has to resist the energy blades and has to be  light enough to be carried, then you have to go with some type of reinforcing  field," Sun countered. "True, there is the power supply situation,  but-"</p><p>"That's for total resistance," Nodoka interrupted; she  was clearly enjoying the conversation. "You are overlooking dissipation.  You can have the right refraction and have it weaken the field. The trick isn't  to block the energy, but to make it lose coherence."</p><p>"Like how a bullet-proof vest dissipates the energy of a  bullet," Sun said, grasping at what Nodoka was getting at. She blinked and  looked at Nodoka. "Wow. Against an energy weapon? I mean - wow, that is a  challenge." Sun then turned to the spaced out DarkStar. "What do you  think?"</p><p>DarkStar blinked a few times before coming back to the here and  now. "Um... I'm just a line grunt?" She blinked a few more times.  "Mom's stuff is great though. Saves a lot of agent's lives."</p><p>Sun blinked at DarkStar. "I take you're not majoring in  chemistry."</p><p>DarkStar shook her head. "I have to get out of high school  first."</p><p>"Oh yeah, I forgot," Sun said. "This is six years  in the past - that is your universe is six years behind mine."</p><p>DarkStar shrugged her shoulders. "I don't really understand  the science behind it, but Ucchan does like those guns you made for her, and  Misa practically sleeps with hers." Which was a bit of a problem given  that the IGMG weighed about a hundred pounds in total, and that the brood slept  as one group.</p><p>Sun looked between DarkStar and Nodoka. "You can magically  enhance your guns?"</p><p>"Just the ammunition," Nodoka said while motioning to  the waitress for more coffee. She was a bit disappointed that this girl  immediately thought to magic for enhancement. There were other ways, did not  their talk about armor just show that?</p><p>"When I was first awakened, the Senshi infused some of their  power into ordinary guns," Sun mentioned casually. "It turned them  into real demon stoppers."</p><p>"Yeah," DarkStar agreed while rubbing her chest and  side. "Anti-demon weapons are... effective."</p><p>Sun noted this and decided to change the subject slightly.  "So, are you going to go to university and follow in your mother's  footsteps?"</p><p>DarkStar looked into her older near-twin's eyes. "No... I'd  rather... find someone and settle down."</p><p>Sun cocked her head, not quite understanding.</p><p>"It's okay," Nodoka said while patting her daughter's  hand. "There's nothing wrong with wanting to be a...  homemaker."</p><p>Sun realized what was meant and smiled. "You know, I never  thought about it, but I'm heading that way myself. Not that I'm  complaining."</p><p>"My kids are everything to me," DarkStar said with  conviction. "I still do my freelance work. Hmmm... I could train agents  more regularly."</p><p>"Don't forget your singing," Nodoka reminded.</p><p>"Mom... that's just a hobby," DarkStar countered.  "It's not serious."</p><p>"Singing? Oooo... I love to sing," Sun added happily.  "Every weekend my husband and I still hit the karoke bar. You?"</p><p>"Uh... I usually do a couple sets, a night or two a week at  the 'Red Turtle', " DarkStar answered. "Um, that's an agent and  succubus bar."</p><p>"That's cool," Sun said. "I don't go out as much as  I used to. Since I got married I've, er, that is, I've been doing other  things," she finished with a slight blush.</p><p>"Yes... I'm now single. Unfortunately," DarkStar sadly  said.</p><p>Sun looked at Nodoka and back at DarkStar, who was starting to  fall into a funk. Looking back at Nodoka, it was as if an unplanned plot was  being hatched between the two.</p><p>"Maybe there is something we can do," Sun ventured.  " I mean, surely you have someone in mind. There was that long shot you  mentioned."</p><p>"If not," Nodoka interjected, "I could compile a  list of candidates."</p><p>"Oooo... who? Who?" Sun asked eagerly.</p><p>"Just no Jarvis, Mom," DarkStar said with a cringe.  "He's a good guy, a great friend, but... I mean he... I think he wants to  be a succubus."</p><p>"But don't you want someone who will accept you for who you  are?" Sun asked.</p><p>"Well, yeah," DarkStar uncomfortably said. "That's  a big part of it. But he's kinda... kinda of that ilk - I mean given his  job."</p><p>"His job?" Sun queried.</p><p>"His job is information extraction and command,"  DarkStar answered with a chill in her voice. "I can respect his reasons  for wanting to get rid of his humanity though..."</p><p>"Er, I don't think I quite understand, but if you're not  comfortable with him, then he's a no-go," Sun said agreeably. "But you  were saying something before your mom showed up."</p><p>DarkStar shifted under the gaze of her table mates. She sighed.  "Umm... Usagi... but that's too much of a long shot. I need someone who can  accept me and... eventually... is willing to give up their  humanity."</p><p>"Usagi?" Sun said with surprise. "Ol'  meatball-head?" she added with an affectionate smile. "But what about  Mamoru?"</p><p>"He died," DarkStar shrugged. "His death was what  awakened me in the first place. It was the start of all this mess. I was the  backup."</p><p>"Oh," Sun blinked. That changed things. "Well,  she's a good person in my world. Strong-willed, too."</p><p>DarkStar was clearly distracted and softly thinking aloud.  "The way she handled those cultists... ," she whispered. "She  was covered in blood and her eyes... in that moment I saw..." her voice  trailed off as she looked at the table top.</p><p>Nodoka leaned toward her daughter. "Have you talked to  her?"</p><p>Blinking as her mother's question registered, she cleared her  throat. "Um, not since the mall."</p><p>The two women studied the demon as she appeared lost in thought  again. The talk of being covered in blood was a bit disturbing, but the  emotions that were betrayed in the demon's behavior were unmistakable.  "Man, you have it bad," Sun said. "Have you at least asked her  for a date?"</p><p>"No... no not yet. I was... Kasumi," DarkStar sadly  said. "And she's dealing with Ami right now." She let a bitter  chuckle escape. "Who would have thought Janet, well.. Naru, and Ami  would turn evil?"</p><p>"Ami? Evil?" Sun said, surprise clearly in her voice.</p><p>DarkStar chuckled again with very little humor in it.  "Putting on a black corset and beating up the Senshi – well that ain't  much when there's a squad of demonic Senshi." She raised her eyes to meet  Sun's. "Usagi wants me to hold back - she doesn't want Ami to be turned by  me... or killed... nor Naru neither. She wants to save them  herself."</p><p>Sun took DarkStar's hands into her own and gave then a sympathetic  squeeze. "I won't pretend to understand what's going on, but if you care  about Usagi, you should be there for her. You seem to have someone in your  corner," the last said while sharing a look at Nodoka. "You can be  there for Usagi like that."</p><p>"I'm trying to help her, I've dealt with stuff like this  before," DarkStar sighed out. "But she's... You know who Naru is? It  turns out that Usagi best friend from before... well she was taken and changed.  Changed into a girl that fell in love with Ami."</p><p>"Oh my!" Sun exclaimed. "Ami must feel  terrible."</p><p>Nodoka was well versed in the situation between Ami and the other  scouts, so remained silent. She instead used the time to study the interaction  between the two Ranmas. They were oddly complementary.</p><p>"She would if she wasn't so enamored with being a dark  Mercury," DarkStar continued with another dark chuckle. "Of course...  Sailor Dark Mercury is nothing compared to Sailor DarkStar."</p><p>"Power is seductive," Sun said in a lost voice.  "That's something I can tell you for certain." The tone in Sun's  voice called to DarkStar and Nodoka. "It's almost like a living thing that  worms into heart and soul." Sun paused a moment. "I know about power.  I hope Ami walks away from it... she won't regret it."</p><p>"Yeah... you see... Ami was brainwashed," DarkStar  corrected. "She wasn't seduced by power. She was seduced by something  more... well... powerful, love."</p><p>The two women sat, hands still joined, pondering the problems that  faced them. Nodoka sat and marveled on how different and how much alike the two  were.</p><p>"So...," Sun said breaking the silence, "back on  the subject. When are you going to make a move on Usagi?"</p><p>"I can't go too fast," DarkStar said. "I don't want  her to think it's my powers seducing her. It has to be real."</p><p>"But you haven't told her how you feel?" Nodoka asked,  rejoining the conversation.</p><p>"No," DarkStar answered. "Of course not. I had... I  thought I had Kasumi... and, that is, I'm a demon and she's...  she's..."</p><p>"You need to tell her," Sun said. All this talking had  finally taken its toll and she motioned toward the waitress. "You at least  owe her that much."</p><p>"I can't tell her," DarkStar complained, "I'm just  getting over Kasumi, Usagi has her hands full with Ami and Naru,  and-"</p><p>"You're scared," Sun interrupted.</p><p>"I'm not scared," DarkStar defensively said.</p><p>Sun gave DarkStar a smirk as she sipped her just served tea.  "You're lying."</p><p>DarkStar looked at Sun with slight surprise before giving her a  pretty pout. Nodoka laughed and clapped her hands with glee as her daughter started  to blush at the unwelcome attention.</p><p>Sun giggled lightly and looked at Nodoka with mischief in her  eyes. "You know maybe we should take matters into our own  hands."</p><p>"Yes," Nodoka mirthfully said. "It would probably be  very beneficial for my daughter to move on with her life."</p><p>DarkStar was dismayed at what was unfolding before her. It was  like watching a horrible accident in slow motion - one that you were powerless  to prevent. It had to be a bad dream.</p><p>Sun stood up, nearly spilling some of her tea as she did. DarkStar  was surprised and further dismayed as her mother mimicked Sun's actions.</p><p>"It's Ranma's -"</p><p>" - and Nodoka's: -"</p><p>" - Operation: Get Sunny a date!"</p><p>The two standing women howled in laughter, drawing curious looks  from everyone in the cafe, civilians and agents alike. As the laughter died  down the two women were facing an empty chair that once housed DarkStar.  Blinking, they looked at one another and then back at the vacant chair just in  time to see DarkStar's head poke up from under the tabletop.</p><p>"Scary...," she whimpered, her eyes shifting between her  mother and the other redhead.</p><p>"I wonder what that was all about," commented Morrison  as he looked at the trio of women cackling in laughter.</p><p>Andrea smiled. "I think they're working on Red's love  life."</p><p>Morrison shook his head. He'd never understand women. Through his  shirt, He idly fingered the "D" stamped into his dog tags, knowing  his luck he might get a chance to understand...</p><p>"Sit back down, Honey," Nodoka said with laughter still  in her voice. "We were just having fun."</p><p>"It's too far fetched," DarkStar sighed as she reclaimed  her seat. "I mean... she's the Moon Princess. Line of Serenity, and I'm a  demon." She dropped and looked at the table.</p><p>"If you have feelings for her... it doesn't matter,"  Sun reassured.</p><p>DarkStar looked her in the eye. "You're a Sailor Senshi. What  would you do if a demon came sniffing around the princess and wanted her?"</p><p>Sun bit her lower lip as she thought a moment. It probably was not  what DarkStar wanted to hear, but she had to be honest. "I - or the other  Senshi in MY universe would do everything to prevent that - unless Usagi said  otherwise," she answered as carefully as possible.</p><p>"Gee, thanks. So for your Usagi it's no, but mine's  fine?"</p><p>"Hey, I said if Usagi said it was all right. Besides, mine's  married. Yours is a widow," Sun reminded. "Things are different here,  so that doesn't count."</p><p>"How do you know that?" DarkStar asked in a pressing  way. "How do you know what the Senshi are like here?"</p><p>"Because you haven't mentioned having to kill any of them  yet," Sun shot back.</p><p>"I owe Setsuna for that one." DarkStar stated flatly.  "She actually explained to them what I was, and I guess it helped. But  you're forgetting something. I haven't shown too much of an interest in her.  What if when I try to make my move Rei or someone blasts me? What if it divides  the Senshi? Well… divides them even more."</p><p>"Look," she continued on in a patient manner, "what's  important is are you going to let a chance of finding love go by  you?"</p><p>DarkStar sat and looked at her other self. "But... you'd stop  if it was yours..." Sighing, she shook her head. "I can't... not  yet."</p><p>"Lord," Sun exclaimed, "I hope I wasn't this  unreasonable about seeing my mother."</p><p>"Yes you were," Nodoka said in bemusement. She then  chuckled. "You two are so much alike, it's amazing."</p><p>She was answered by two pouting Ranmas. Nodoka covered her mouth  as she giggled at the sight, but it did lighten the mood considerably. The  three relaxed a bit into their seats as each quietly sipped their drinks. A  companionable silence fell as a sense of camaraderie was felt between them.</p><p>"So daughter-" Nodoka said in a way only mothers could master.  DarkStar herself was proficient, but still not as skilled as Nodoka.  "-what are you going to do?"</p><p>DarkStar sat and pondered. "I have... I need to move  slowly," she said. Sun opened her mouth to say something, but was stopped  by DarkStar's upheld hand. "It's important to me that Usagi's feelings for  me are real and not something made by my influence."</p><p>Sun nodded, even if she didn't fully understand the whole meaning  behind what DarkStar just said. "There's nothing wrong with slow,"  she agreed. "Hell, when I fell for Tenchi, I wasn't even looking."  She paused and looked at DarkStar. "So what do you have  planned?"</p><p>DarkStar sighed softly. "I don't know. What am I supposed to  do? Walk up to her and ask her if we could go out for lunch or something?</p><p>"Well that would be a start," Sun deadpanned.</p><p>"You don't want to be too clever," Nodoka  cautioned.</p><p>"But how can I even approach her?" DarkStar asked,  looking at Sun in the eye. "She has nightmares about being with  me."</p><p>"Nightmares? About you? Are they nightmares or... wet  dreams?" Sun asked boldly.</p><p>"Er, both," DarkStar admitted. "Also she was  influenced a bit to fall for me... stupid Murdock."</p><p>There was a pause as Sun considered something. "Tuxedo  Highflyer?" she asked.</p><p>"No, the same guy who corrupted Ami and Naru," DarkStar  answered, looking confused, but she let it pass. Nodoka gave Sun a blank stare  and shook her head slightly. Sun noticed the looks and shrugged her shoulders.  Maybe the Alpha Guard didn't exist here.</p><p>"Doesn't matter," Sun said with a frustrated wave of her  hand. She then leaned toward the demon. "Does it change the way Usagi  feels about you... or how you feel about her?"</p><p>"Yes, yes it would!" DarkStar growled. "That's what  I was trying to say."</p><p>"Calm down, dear," Nodoka advised putting her hand on  her daughter's shoulder.</p><p>"But do you know? It sounds like you're using that as your  excuse," Sun pointed.</p><p>"I - I guess it is an excuse," DarkStar finally admitted  after considering how smooth the table top was. "But I can't take  advantage of her," she said looking up, "not if what she feels isn't  real."</p><p>"How do you know that what she's feeling is real or not and  how she really feels about you?" Sun pressed. "Maybe she is just as  interested in you, but is just as scared."</p><p>DarkStar looked down on the table's surface again. "She  did... she just lost her lover... and I guess she could be scared." She  looked up with a firm look. "I guess it couldn't hurt... I have to be  slow."</p><p>"Are you that afraid of love?" Sun asked. She would  never have guessed that a sex demon would be so hesitant.</p><p>"Yes. Love is powerful. Love changes people," DarkStar  pointed to a photograph of her children. "Literally and permanently for my  kind. My girls weren't always like this. I helped them as best as I could and  that meant some things had to be let go. Love saves too. It saved their  lives... their souls."</p><p>Sun paused. A demon talking about souls... but her twin had a  point. For a sex demon love was more primal, and more... dangerous.</p><p>"I held back around Kasumi, and even then she felt that I was  pushing her, forcing her to commit," DarkStar's hands shook. "It was  just so easy to see her as my mate. We had sex, sex as lovers, not as a demon  feeding on a human."</p><p>"Explain to her, Usagi may understand," Sun  offered.</p><p>"You're not getting it are you?" DarkStar sighed.  "If Usagi and I start dating then what?"</p><p>"Get married?" Sun said hopefully.</p><p>"Oh, I see," Nodoka noted as she gently put down the mug  she was about to sip from.</p><p>DarkStar nodded sadly.</p><p>"What?" Sun inquired.</p><p>"You said you and <i>your</i> Senshi friends would only back  off if Usagi agreed to the demon's advances. But what if... what if  somehow-" DarkStar smiled despite herself.</p><p>Sun looked at DarkStar with a look of incomprehension on her face. She then remembered one of the reasons Kasumi broke up  with Ranma. Her eyes slowly widened as realization struck her. "Oh  God."</p><p>DarkStar frowned at the last word.  "Yes, can you imagine your princess like that? Like this?" DarkStar  said showing her fangs. Her expression faltered and she leaned onto her mother.  "At least your species isn't the embodiment of female lust."</p><p>"It's okay," Nodoka comforted. "It's  okay."</p><p>"I think my husband would disagree with you on that  point," Sun quipped a bit glibly, and then paused as she truly studied the  display. It was too much Usagi... doing <i>that</i>, but true love... "It  will be okay, if it is true love," Sun reaffirmed. "Then... then it  will overcome any obstacle."</p><p>Keeping her head on her mother's side, DarkStar looked over at  Sun. Her eyes were suspicious and Sun noted how predatory they really were.  "Love, true love finds a way. It always does," Sun assured in a voice  barely above a whisper as she turned and peered out the window. "It always  has."</p><p>The two Saotome women studied the other as a quite moment  stretched on.</p><p>"Voice of experience?" DarkStar softly asked as she  basked in the warmth of her mother's embrace.</p><p>Sun continued to look out the window. After a slight hesitation,  she answered the question with a jerky nod.</p><p>"Wanna talk about it?"</p><p>Sun faced the two, who were still embraced, and smiled thinly.  "Maybe later," she said with a hint of something undefined in her  voice. "Right now let's talk about you."</p><p>"What? What about me?" DarkStar asked as she lifted her  head up.</p><p>"Well, why do you have an interest in Usagi? Is it just  physical?" Sun inquired.</p><p>"You two do have stuff in common," Nodoka  interjected.</p><p>"You both lost someone," Sun ventured.</p><p>"There's that," Nodoka smiled. "You're both single  mothers. You both have groups of Senshi you're in charge of. You've had  daughters turned evil. There's also your willingness to do what is right no  matter the personal cost."</p><p>DarkStar smiled slightly. "I... guess."</p><p>Sun noted other similarities. The emotional displays and raw  affection were similar too. "You respect her, don't you?"</p><p>"Well of course," DarkStar raised an eyebrow. "I've  seen her fight, and how much she cares for her girls."</p><p>"Does she respect you?" Sun inquired before sipping her  tea.</p><p>"I have no idea," DarkStar pouted.</p><p>"Perhaps you should try and find out," Nodoka suggested.  "There are two ways to approach the problem: Direct and  subtle."</p><p>"Mom, I'm not spying on Usagi. I'd come across as a  stalker," DarkStar said with a hint of frustration in her voice.</p><p>"Then that leaves the direct method: Ask her," Nodoka  stated.</p><p>DarkStar sighed. She looked at her mother and then to her human  twin. "I'm not getting out of this until I promise to talk to Usagi am  I?"</p><p>She was answered by two shaking heads.</p><p>DarkStar sighed again, then remained silent for a few moments.  "Okay, I'll talk to her - BUT not right now. I'm still getting over Kasumi  and I don't want to distract Usagi while she is dealing with Ami."</p><p>Sun nodded. "Okay, fair enough," she said, "but you  will be there for her in case she needs you?"</p><p>"Of course I will," DarkStar said, slightly offended.  "I don't leave my friends when they need me the most."</p><p>Sun smiled back at DarkStar. At least they were getting somewhere.  Silence revisited the table as all three women took sips of their drinks and  shared looks.</p><p>"Looks like things are winding down," Morrison commented  as he shifted in his chair. His butt was getting sore from all the sitting.</p><p>Andrea smirked.</p><p>"Can I ask you something?" Nodoka said in a pleasant  voice. "I noticed in your photographs that none of the Tendo girls were  present."</p><p>Sun thought a moment before answering. "That's because I  haven't seen any of them in the last six years," Sun replied. "They -  turned their backs on me."</p><p>"Oh dear, that doesn't sound like the girls I know,"  Nodoka said after emptying her cup and motioning for the waitress.  "They're all such nice girls."</p><p>"Well... I was engaged to Akane," Sun said. "She  was a real tomboy-type and she always seemed to want to help whether she was  capable or not. Kasumi was a very sweet, typical Japanese-house wife type, and  Nabiki was gold-digging bitch that would have sold me into prostitution if she  had the chance."</p><p>"I couldn't imagine being engaged to Akane," DarkStar  chimed, "and your Nabiki... Well mine went though..." she shook her  head. "Your Tendos seem a lot different than mine. I mean your Kasumi...  no military, not even police?"</p><p>Sun blinked, and sipped her drink. "No... not unless she had  a breakdown or something. It has been six years, but Nabiki didn't mention  anything."</p><p>"That's what got my- <i>our </i>- Kasumi into WIC in the  first place." DarkStar shrugged. "But engaged... to  Akane?"</p><p>"Well Akane wasn't bad - she wasn't afraid to show her  disapproval, though," Sun said with a smirk. "It was just that...  when I needed help the most... when I got stuck as a girl permanent... when  Genma," she spat the name, "disowned me... no one helped  me."</p><p>"It's funny," DarkStar said absently. "When I first  was locked as a demon, there was one guy that helped me... stupid Murdock - but  later on, after I... finished... with Alexia, I ended up locked and not really  caring." The demon smirked. "I didn't even notice I was locked until  Ucchan asked me about it. Kasumi seemed to take it harder than me." Her  expression soured. "Guess she wanted the human me."</p><p>Sun smirked. "Nothing wrong with being a girl."</p><p>"True, so true," DarkStar said dryly in a fake English  accent.</p><p>The two girls giggled.</p><p>"It is horrible that the Tendo girls turned their backs on  you though," Nodoka said in a disappointed way. "What good is someone  if you can't depend on them when it counts?"</p><p>Sun sighed. "To be fair, I think the Tendo girls were  surprised by what Genma did. I know they knew that Genma wanted me to marry  their father to join the damned schools, but I can't honestly say that they  thought he'd go as far as throwing me out. I don't know... I think maybe they  thought that me getting locked was something that would work itself out like  all the other messes that I got into."</p><p>"Other messes?" DarkStar asked.</p><p>"Yes, my life back then... It was a mess - multiple  engagements, and a constant stream of piddling little adventures," Sun  smirked.</p><p>"Ick, that kind nonsense must have worn you down,"  DarkStar stated.</p><p>"You have no idea."</p><p>"But, are you going to visit them?" Nodoka asked.  "At least to get some closure?"</p><p>Sun lifted the almost empty cup to her mouth and paused.  "I'll see them today along with my mother," she said before  completing the motion with the cup.</p><p>Nodoka nodded in an approving way as Sun finished her tea.</p><p>"Well, we talked about me," DarkStar said, "we  talked about you," she continued while looking at Sun, "now we going  to talk about you, mother dear."</p><p>Nodoka blinked-blinked at her daughter. "Me? I'm perfectly  fine, dear."</p><p>"Right," DarkStar snorted. "You've been alone for  ten years - is there someone you're interested in?"</p><p>Nodoka looked at her daughter and Sun. They both had the same  scheming look in their eyes. It was right then she knew she was in trouble.  "I'm a WIC officer. I'm..."</p><p>"Not allowed to have romance?" DarkStar laughed. "I  know for a fact that the Company's not that restrictive."</p><p>"Does anyone interest you? Any hobbies?" Sun asked  inquisitively.</p><p>"I have my work and my family," Nodoka quietly said. For  a long time she just had work.</p><p>DarkStar reached out to her mother. "Don't you want someone  for your own?"</p><p>"I have you and my grandchildren," Nodoka said with a  smile. "I don't need anything else."</p><p>"Mom," DarkStar began in a half-pleading way,  "you've been alone for too long. I know you don't need a mate like I do,  but you should have someone."</p><p>Nodoka hugged her daughter. "I guess, but... I've..."  She looked into her daughter's violet eyes. "I'll think about  it."</p><p>"That's all I ask," DarkStar said as she untangled  herself from her mother. "Well guys," she said as she rose from her  chair. "If you excuse me, I gotta use the powder room."</p><p>The two seated women watched as the demon-Ranma made her way  toward the back of the cafe where the restrooms were located. Once she had  gone, Sun turned to Nodoka. "Can I ask you a question? It's rather  personal. You don't have to answer if you don't want to."</p><p>"That depends on the question," Nodoka said.</p><p>"Well... it's more about Nariko," Sun paused.  "What... what happened to her?</p><p>Nodoka looked up at the bathroom door where her daughter had left  too. "I suppose you can hear this. Nariko... Nariko was Ranma's first.  This was back when my daughter still thought her demonic body was just a  costume with creepy powers. Even after turning someone she didn't know what she  was. Nariko was dying. Ranma saved her life."</p><p>Sun nodded. She could understand that desire to clutch onto your  manhood. "So Nariko was a human, what happened?"</p><p>"I guess I should explain a bit about how succubae  work," Nodoka's tone shifted to that of a lecturing scientist... "A  newly turned succubus is a very delicate thing. Dependent on support by her  mother. New body, new urges, a fragile young mind. A new succubus needs a  guiding force to help deal with it all."</p><p>"And DarkStar..." Sun felt cold at the  realization.</p><p>"Yes, she saw 'Nariko' as a reminder of her inhumanity. The  poor girl's affections annoyed her, especially given who she was.. Ranma tried  to help... by trying to cure her, but she wasn't being a mother. Motherhood was  the last thing Ranma wanted then."</p><p>"What happened? And who was Nariko?"</p><p>"Was there a Tatewaki Kuno where you're from?"</p><p>"The sweet and nice girl? Kuno's Nariko?" Sun felt even  more of the universe fall out below her. "My God, Kuno's got both Akane  and Ranma."</p><p>"Yes," Nodoka nodded. "Akane and Nariko are mates.  Nariko saved Akane's life... but that's another story."</p><p>Sun blinked a few times.</p><p>"As I was saying, new succubae are very dependant on their  mothers. Without a mother helping them grow and nursing them... they get  damaged. Their bodies weaken and their minds... get worse."</p><p>"Not that Kuno had much of one to start with," Sun  commented before almost physically being knocked back by the elder Saotome's  glare.</p><p>"You have no idea what he... she went through. Nariko has  more strength in her than anyone I've ever seen and never <i>ever</i> stopped  believing in her mother. She's why my daughter became who she is, she saved  Ranma. Then there's what she went through with all that Eclipse crap,"  Nodoka said very sternly while staring down the younger woman. "Nariko's  father helped as best as he could, and I'm sure it saved her, but Nariko wanted  her mother. She needed her mother."</p><p>Sun was glad she had waited until DarkStar had left to ask her  question. She swallowed, and bent under the elder Saotome woman's gaze. It was  piercing and something she was not used to, not since her grandmother.  "I-I'm sorry... I didn't mean to offend," she apologized while deeply  bowing. Though she didn't stick her foot in her mouth as much as she used to,  Sun still had the occasional tendency of saying the wrong things. "I  didn't realize... I'm sorry..."</p><p>"Neither did Ranma at the time," Nodoka said more  gently, her eyes softening. "But it still hurt Nariko."</p><p>"But DarkStar figured it out, eventually," Sun offered.  "But I guess some of the... damage was irreversible?"</p><p>Nodoka sipped her coffee. "Yes, Ranma came to me. Eventually,  she realized what she was, and what her responsibilities were. I had to agree  with her, it was scary, but it was the right thing to do."</p><p>"You encouraged her to become a mother?"</p><p>Nodoka laughed. "My dear, she <i>already</i> was a  mother."</p><p>"Did Nariko forgive her for what DarkStar did to  her?"</p><p>The officer paused to think things over. "I don't think she  ever blamed Ranma. Nariko was just happy to have her Mommy, and Ranma... well  her body finally meant something."</p><p>"She wasn't kidding when she said motherhood changes  people."</p><p>"Not in the slightest. Ranma lives for her children. I'm  amazed the things she's done to help them. I wish... I wish I could have been  half the mother she is."</p><p>"What are you talking about? You're her anchor." Sun  pointed to the empty seat that was next to Nodoka's. "I've seen how she is  around you. She goes to you for advice and support."</p><p>"She did spend half the night crying in my lap after she  killed her first human," Nodoka noted.</p><p>"Huh?" Sun knew she did not hear that right; she  couldn't have.</p><p>"He was a sniper who shot Ukyou. DarkStar tried block it, and  lost most of her side doing it. He would have picked off the rest of her  children and the agents with them if she hadn't stopped him."</p><p>"But he was... human. Did she have to?"</p><p>"Not all monsters have fangs," Nodoka stated.  "DarkStar was protecting her young, and she literally needed her pound of  flesh."</p><p>Sun's hand went to her stomach. Thinking of her yet-to-be born  child, she found it easy to think of killing anyone or anything to protect it.  She was starting to understand those maternal drives, and DarkStar was a  demonic mother. "But... this proves my point. You accepted your daughter  fully. Even after she...," Sun finished with a wave of her hand.</p><p>"I was just trying to make it up to my daughter."</p><p>Sun nodded in understanding and paused for a moment. "I've  got another question," she stated. "Don't worry... it's not as  serious."</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"What did you see in Genma in the first place?" Sun  asked. "I mean, I'm not sure how your Genma is here, but it seems he  caused about as much trouble as mine did. Why did you pick him?"</p><p>Nodoka studied the younger redhead across from her. She furrowed  her brow in thought before speaking. "He had a passion for life, and, in  his own way, a sense of direction and purpose. He seemed to know exactly where  he was going, even if he didn't know how to get there. In his way he was...  kind. The sex was also very good, and he seemed willing to raise our child  while I worked," Nodoka laughed bitterly.</p><p>Sun was sitting and musing over the older woman's answer when  DarkStar returned to the table. "Whew," she said casually. "I  feel much better."</p><p>Nodoka smirked a bit at DarkStar's behavior. "Now that you  have brought that to my attention, if you'll excuse me," Nodoka said as  she rose from her seat and walked the path that DarkStar had earlier.</p><p>"Your mom is still married to Genma?" Sun asked DarkStar  once the older women was gone.</p><p>"Yes," DarkStar answered with a shrug. "What about  it?" Genma had been quite a bit better lately, but DarkStar knew there was  no chance of her parents getting back together. The best she could hope for  would be them to act civil with each other.</p><p>"How can she move on with her life if she is still connected  to him?" Sun asked pointedly. "She should have ditched his ass years  ago."</p><p>DarkStar nodded. "So what does that have to do with  anything?"</p><p>Sun rolled her eyes.</p><p>"I'm sorry," DarkStar sighed. "But Mom's been  separated for ten years already."</p><p>Sun considered that. "All the more reason to convince her to  move on with her life by divorcing Genma, formally."</p><p>"Yeah," DarkStar thought aloud, "She might go for  that. It won't really be much. It would be a step in the right  direction."</p><p>"Hey, they say that 'a journey of a thousand miles, starts  with the first step'," Sun said trying to sound sage.</p><p>DarkStar smirked. It was easy to sound wise, especially when  teaching.</p><p>"It may not be really much at the moment, but it would free  her up if someone did strike her fancy in the future."</p><p>DarkStar smiled. "And there would be really nothing for mom  to object too, either."</p><p>Sun smiled. The goal was set and the plot was easily hatched;  Nodoka wouldn't have a chance. Just as the two were about to continue  discussing their scheme, Nodoka returned and reclaimed her seat across from  Sun. "As you put it daughter: much better," she smirked at  DarkStar.</p><p>Sun giggled at DarkStar's slightly pinking complexion, which stood  out even more against her pale skin. That was when it was nature's turn to call  upon her.</p><p>"Wait," DarkStar said as Sun excused herself,  "while you're in there, can I have another look at that photo  album?"</p><p>Sun paused and almost tipped over her feet at the request.  "What?"</p><p>"What do you mean 'what'?" DarkStar asked. "It's  only sex. You're not embarrassed are you? Sex is very natural."</p><p>Sun hesitated and looked to Nodoka for support, but none was  forthcoming. "Er...," Sun began, only to be derailed by DarkStar's  puppy dog eyes... and there was nothing more pitiful than those purple eyes  filled with hope. "Oh what the heck," Sun gave in while reaching into  her sub space pocket. "Here, you've already seen them."</p><p>DarkStar took the album with all the enthusiasm of a child with a  new toy on Christmas day. "Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!" she said  happily as she immediately poured over the photos.</p><p>Sun sweatdropped at the demon's behavior. Seeing that Nodoka  wasn't a least fazed by her daughter acting this way, she chalked it up to the  differences in this universe and hers. Heading toward the back of the cafe, she  was unaware that she was being followed.</p><p>"She's heading for the restrooms," Morrison pointed  out.</p><p>"I'm already on it," Andrea said while rising from her  seat. She moved quickly and subtlety followed the redhead into the ladies room.  Besides, she needed to go herself.</p><p>Once Sun was in the restroom, DarkStar leaned back in her chair  and looked at the lone agent who was parked across the room. "Hey  Morrison!" she called while waving the blue book with one hand. "You  got your camera? I want copies of this stuff!"</p><p>"Ranma!" Nodoka admonished. "Don't talk to the  surveillance agents!"</p><p>"But mom...," DarkStar started to whine, but was  interrupted by catching a small, digital camera. "Thanks!" she called  out to the agent who was desperately trying to go back to being  inconspicuous.</p><p>"Dear...," Nodoka began sternly, but was derailed by  DarkStar asking, "Can you hold this flat for me please?"</p><p>Nodoka sighed and held the book's covers flat as DarkStar focused  and snapped a few photos, giggling with glee all while doing so. "This is  great, isn't it?" DarkStar asked while flipping a page and waited for  Nodoka to hold it open for her. "I gotta try some of this."</p><p>"W-what are you doing?" Sun's shocked voice of stammered  out, heralding her return.</p><p>"Research," DarkStar answered merrily while taking  another shot.</p><p>"B-but what -?" Sun began indignantly. "That's  mine! I didn't mean for you to-"</p><p>"That's why I'm making a copy," DarkStar said, cutting  off Sun's objection. "But you're going to have to explain this one to  me," she said while pointing at the photo she had just snapped a shot of.  "How'd you manage to get into that position?"</p><p>Sun mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water before  DarkStar's words registered. "A copy!" she half-shrieked.</p><p>"Yeah," DarkStar answered distractedly. "My kids  would love to see these."</p><p>"Your <i>kids</i>?" Sun's hands spasmed. She thought of  Akane and Nariko giggling over these photographs while they readied some rope  and other toys.</p><p>"They're succubae too, you know." DarkStar laughed.  "Say, would you like a video of my stuff?" She leaned back in her  chair once again and called across the cafe. "Hey! Did you guys record  that time with me and Kasumi when we were in the den?"</p><p>"Thank goodness I left my tapes at home," Sun muttered,  trying to tune DarkStar's naughty request out. She felt the beginnings of a  headache.</p><p>"I told you she was okay with this stuff," a clearly  amused Nodoka said.</p><p>"And you weren't kidding," Sun said as she rubbed her temples  with her hands as she sat back down.</p><p>DarkStar pouted at the two. "Well I happen to like  these," she said while returning the photo album to Sun. "They're  very passionate and imaginative. I can't wait to try them myself."</p><p>Sun boggled at the sight of a very happy sex demon. It might not  have been food, but the pictures were like a menu that made DarkStar long for  more variety in her diet - a variety that she was now more than ready to  explore. At least there was an upside to this: DarkStar had yet another reason  to find a mate.</p><p>Sun noted that the camera disappeared somewhere on DarkStar's  person and wondered for a brief moment if it was worth the argument. She  eventually decided to shrug it off.</p><p>"Er, thanks... I think," Sun said. Something did not sit  right. "Wait... who were you talking to about recording your sex  stuff?"</p><p>"Um, you remember earlier when I told you we were being  monitored?" DarkStar said.</p><p>"You mean we're still being watched?" Sun asked in a  whisper, leaning forward. Her eyes now shifted around the room.</p><p>"Let's see... WIC Toronto's trump card, their top scientist,  and some unknown Pattern Silver that teleported in... yep," DarkStar said  conversationally, "we're being watched."</p><p>"That's kinda creepy," Sun said. "They're not going  to do anything... rash, are they?"</p><p>"Rash?" Nodoka said with a raised eyebrow. "Dear,  they've managed not to do anything rash around my daughter and granddaughters.  I also outrank everyone here..."</p><p>"That's good...," Sun said, relaxing a bit.</p><p>"... so unless you are planning on doing something worse than  gutting a screaming man and feasting on his liver, you have nothing to worry  about," Nodoka finished.</p><p>DarkStar nervously coughed.</p><p>"I don't like liver," Sun said before blinking. She then  realized what Nodoka had just said. It fit with the earlier story about that  sniper. "Eww." She paled and her hands went to protect her baby. She  then turned to DarkStar. "You... you... didn't?" Sun assumed that  Ranma merely drained people, like the demons in her universe did, not...  literally eat them.</p><p>"What do you want to hear?" DarkStar said as she gently  deposited her teacup. "You know I'm a demon but you don't <i>know </i>it.  You haven't seen me fight, and I hope you never do." That WIC agents were  unfazed by seeing her fight and feed was comforting, if a bit creepy.</p><p>"I guess you'll telling me I'm better off not knowing."  Sun stated.</p><p>"We're in a war," Nodoka interjected. "An ugly,  secret war." She sighed. "I'm guessing the Senshi where you're from  never had to fight humans."</p><p>"I don't think the Senshi had to fight any humans, but I  can't be sure," Sun admitted. "I was only - reawakened late - because  of a mass invasion."</p><p>Nodoka held her peace at the mass invasion comment. That was one  of the things WIC existed to prevent.</p><p>DarkStar smirked. "Humans can be monsters too. Look at  history. But yes, it's much easier to dehumanize your enemies." She  sardonically chucked. "Especially when they're not human."</p><p>"I know my history. I know what you mean," Sun replied  evenly. "It's just that I haven't had to..." As she paused to  organize herself, she looked over her counterpart. It was hard to believe that  she was so young and had been a demon less than a year. "You said before  that you're a line grunt right? I'm more like... a battleship."</p><p>"A battleship?" Nodoka inquired. She wanted to use this  opportunity to glean some more knowledge of Sun's abilities. "That seems  rather... an extravagant description."</p><p>Sun idly ran a finger over the rim of her cup, appearing to be  lost in thought.</p><p>"Yeah, I guess it is," Sun said as she recalled being  all of creation and pushing it away and almost being lost in it. She shuddered;  her full potential was frightening. "A closer analogy would be a 'doomsday  weapon' - an ultimate deterrent; a fat lot of good it did them."</p><p>"Let me guess, you were too  powerful to use?" Nodoka could easily see that. Weapons too powerful to  use were half a century old technology. Perfectly sensible for a more advanced  civilization to have even more powerful and thus even more impractical weapons.</p><p>"Uh, yeah." Sun replied as she looked at the others. She decided  to dissuade any skepticism. "Look, I'm being serious here."</p><p>"We're not questioning your honesty," DarkStar  commented. She knew  what her grandmother could do, so powerful beings were not beyond her  imagination. "But why so much  power?"</p><p>"Can you believe that it was an accident?" Sun replied  with a half snort, half laugh. "Those idiots were aiming for the ultimate weapon, well they  got it."</p><p>"It seems that there are a great many things these people  overlooked," Nodoka commented, thinking back on the earlier oversight of  Sun's creators. "What were they thinking?"</p><p>Sun shrugged her shoulders. "Desperate politicians and fears of  the unknown at the time...," she trailed off as she fingered her cup  again. "So they made me."</p><p>DarkStar nodded. That fit with her double's earlier comments about  being made to be a weapon. "So you just have targets, not people,"  she shrugged. The brood's own experience with indirect fire-support left her  less than thrilled. She would rather work with a small team of professionals in  battle.</p><p>"Yes," Sun nodded. "I've been lucky. Everything  I've fought has been... clear. Still though, you guys seem to be open enough  around me."</p><p>"You're a Senshi," DarkStar added with a shrug.  "And if you were bad-"</p><p>Sun silenced DarkStar with a wave of her hand. "I wouldn't...  and I killed the one who would."</p><p>"So what's the problem then?" DarkStar asked.</p><p>"It's just creepy knowing you're being watched," Sun  said. "It's... creepy," Sun repeated, being at a loss for descriptive  words. She had worn one of Washu's monitoring devices but that did not actually  spy on everything she said and did.</p><p>"You get used to it," Nodoka said plainly. "They're  normal human beings and professionals - like we are."</p><p>"Emphasis on professionals. They're just human, but..."  DarkStar gave a fanged grin. "They show what <i>just human</i> can do.  Take that guy," she pointed to Morrison. "He doesn't look it, but he  killed a succubus in melee. She had him pinned and was cutting him apart and  what does he do? Slits her throat just as she's about to feed."</p><p>Sun nodded, only vaguely understanding. She could clearly see that  the agent in question seemed embarrassed by the attention he was getting.  "You seem... close to them."</p><p>"Aren't you're close to the people you fight with?"  DarkStar asked. "Hey mom, isn't Morrison also alive because of your  armor?"</p><p>Nodoka blushed slightly. "Yes... it reduced the damage those  claws did to him."</p><p>Sun raised an eyebrow. It looked like Nodoka was speaking from  experience when she talked of energy resistant armor.</p><p>"You do good work, Mom," DarkStar assured. "And  those agents need every edge they can get."</p><p>"He's also alive because you grabbed him out of a crashing  helicopter," Nodoka reminded.</p><p>Sun blinked and looked between mother and daughter. "And they  watch you... even when you..."</p><p>"Make wild nookie?" DarkStar said with great mirth,  enjoying Sun's paranoia. "Yes they do."</p><p>"But... but... even then?" Sun asked  incredulously.</p><p>"Tell me," Nodoka said, "when you are in a fight,  do the other Senshi watch out for each other?"</p><p>Sun blinked at the question. "Well yes - of course we  do," she answered. "We have too. We depend on each other in a  fight."</p><p>"It's the same here," Nodoka explained. "We are in  a war with enemies that can show up anywhere at anytime. In a situation like  that, everyone watches everyone's backs. It's the only way to stay  alive."</p><p>"It seems so... dehumanizing," Sun said softly.</p><p>DarkStar snickered.</p><p>"Not at all," Nodoka said. "Once you get used to  it... you find a certain amount of comfort in it. It's nice to know that there  is someone you can count on watching over you and watching out for  you."</p><p>Sun considered that. These people were at war. It seemed and a  certain amount of security was necessary. She shrugged her shoulders.  "Okay... I guess. I don't think I could ever get used to it."</p><p>"You would be surprised," DarkStar piped in. "I  wasn't sure at first... but it does save lives. Also... I know what I am."  Her voice became more serious. "The command staff's honest about things  with me." Her voice became more serious. "We have a bit of an  understanding."</p><p>"Understanding?"</p><p>"They've been honest with me from the start. It took a while  to build trust with them, but it's there."</p><p>Sun nodded her head; she understood about trust. Turning her  attention to Nodoka, Sun returned to the previous conversation, before they got  side tracked by DarkStar's "research" and them being watched.  "So Mom-, er, sorry, Mrs. Saotome, why haven't you ever divorced  Genma?"</p><p>Nodoka smiled at Sun's slip. "That's alright dear, just call  me Nodoka or Mom if you're comfortable."</p><p>"And if you're not comfortable it's Doc or Major  Saotome," DarkStar teased.</p><p>"As far as Genma goes, the reason why I never divorced him  was because he had been on the run from me for the past ten years, and when I  finally found him I was more concerned with my daughter and her  life."</p><p>DarkStar blushed slightly.</p><p>"I can understand that," Sun said. "But why not  divorce Genma and be done with it?" Sun asked the older woman. "I  mean, why hang on to a marriage that... never worked?"</p><p>"I had more important things to do," Nodoka said,  "and... it already feels done with."</p><p>"Mom, you haven't said more than ten words with him since he  got back," DarkStar stated.</p><p>"I asked him to explain his actions," Nodoka replied,  her tone even. Genma had at least accepted the  reality of Ranma's gender and family.</p><p>"You pulled out a gun and then afterwards you had some agents  take him and hand him over to Jarvis," DarkStar corrected.</p><p>"I don't feel the need to do it," Nodoka sighed.</p><p>"You're essentially divorced already, just do it  formally," DarkStar encouraged.</p><p>"I guess you're not too fond of Genma either," Sun  noted.</p><p>"He can be annoying, but he did try to warn me about the  breakup, and he does seem... proud of me. I know that sometimes parents just  don't feel that way for each other."</p><p>"You do?" Sun asked.</p><p>DarkStar smirked. "Remember? I didn't want to marry Soun  either."</p><p>Sun absently nodded. Her double was the mother of two of Soun's  daughters. "And then there's Nariko..."</p><p>"Yes, Drake's actually... I can respect him. He was great for  Nariko. He actually is there for his children," DarkStar smiled. "But  that doesn't mean I want to mate with him. Nari-chan understands."</p><p>Sun nodded. "So are you teaching your kids martial  arts?" she asked after ordering another cup.</p><p>"Of course, we are 'line grunts' as you say," DarkStar  laughed. "It's amazing how much that training can compliment our  abilities. Of course we had to rework a lot of the moves. New balance, and then  there's that it can be a truly aerial style."</p><p>Sun nodded. "Master Happosai has just named me his heir and  Master to the Anything Goes school," Sun said with a small bit of pride  before adding with a sigh, "It took years, but he managed to knock some  sense into my thick head."</p><p>"Oh?" DarkStar asked as she blinked at her  counterpart.</p><p>Sun looked at each of her table-mates before answering. "I  had a bad habit - a very bad habit - of jumping into things and reacting on an  emotional level - without thought," Sun explained. "It made me  careless and I got myself into some very bad spots that I should not have been  into to begin with."</p><p>"That's stupid habit to have," DarkStar bluntly agreed.  "It's not professional."</p><p>"I wasn't a professional," Sun shot back. "I was an  arrogant, cocky kid who thought she was so powerful that she couldn't be  touched."</p><p>Nodoka and DarkStar looked at Sun and said nothing. DarkStar did  not like what she felt, but part of her was amused to know that arrogance  seemed to have bitten this version of herself too. Though it was unsaid, she  sensed it was also at someone else's expense - maybe like what happened to  herself.</p><p>"Look, we all made stupid mistakes when we were younger. We  both had emotions getting the better of us and then there's how stubborn we can  be," DarkStar explained.</p><p>Sun said nothing, but nodded in agreement. She did find irony in  someone six years her junior saying "when we were younger".</p><p>"So, Happosai made you a master," DarkStar commented,  steering away from uncomfortable subjects. "He's nice enough, for a dirty  old man."</p><p>"Hey!" Sun bristled. "He may seem like a dirty old  man, but he's not bad."</p><p>DarkStar laughed. "I never said he was bad. I'm a sex demon  remember? I ain't gonna get on his case for having some harmless fun and a  little draining."</p><p>Sun blinked. "Oh... I guess that makes sense. You two would  have some things in common."</p><p>"He also has great taste in underwear," DarkStar  nonchalantly added as she sipped her drink.</p><p>Sun blinked. She thought back to some of the antics of her  Happosai and mentally agreed. "So does yours help you train?"</p><p>"Yeah, he knows his stuff. Lots of experience. And unlike  Pops he doesn't get tired when he spars with me." DarkStar snickered.</p><p>"He make you a master yet?" Sun asked.</p><p>"Nope, I haven't known him that long. Would be nice  though."</p><p>"Oh yeah, six years in the past." Sun noted; she then  smiled. "But I'm sure he's impressed with you. You are coming up with your  own school."</p><p>"Yeah," DarkStar shook her head. "I never  understood why Pops and Soun were so afraid of him. He's such a gentleman,  especially around my kids."</p><p>Sun blinked. DarkStar's Happosai had never subjected her to the  pervert act? The testing?</p><p>"To be fair... my former... husband and his friend were never  as focused or principled as you are. And you were never afraid or intimidated  by him," Nodoka added.</p><p>Sun nodded. That had to be it. Happosai had seen that DarkStar  would pass any test like that, probably. "Don't underestimate him. He's...  good. Some of his training came..." Sun shuddered at the memory. After a  few seconds she found her voice again. "When it counted, when it really  counted. It made all the difference."</p><p>"I won't," DarkStar promised.</p><p>"Good," Sun answered with a thin smile. "Who'd  thought that the old letch had it in him to be a good teacher."</p><p>"Anyone who doesn't judge a book by it's cover?"  DarkStar responded. She looked at Sun's souring expression. "Sorry."</p><p>"No, it's okay," Sun sighed. "I have a tendency to  do that. You saw what happened when we first met. Happi's helping me with that  too."</p><p>"What can I say? Being turned into a demon and working with  scary secret agents tends to do that? I can't judge anyone based on something  like what species they are. Now if they harm my kids or an innocent... all bets  are off."</p><p>"Andrea, how long does girl talk usually last?" Morrison  asked in a tired voice. "I mean, they've been at it for hours now."</p><p>"I'd say not much longer," Andrea said  offhandedly.</p><p>"Because of her watch?"</p><p>"Yes, our visiting Senshi is glancing at it much more often  than before," Andrea answered. "My guess is she has someplace to be  and it's getting closer to that time."</p><p>"I hope you're right," Morrison said as he shifted in  his seat. "I'm getting sore from just sitting here."</p><p>"So, what are your plans once you have dealt with your mother  and the other people from your past?" DarkStar asked.</p><p>"Well, whether it goes smoothly or not, I'm going to be  leaving in about six months to my husband's... well... my husband's  planet."</p><p>"His planet?" Nodoka asked with a raised eyebrow.  "Same universe though?"</p><p>Sun nodded. "Yup," she paused to take a sip of her  drink. "Same universe, different planet. I married an honest to goodness  prince. He's like third or forth in line to the throne or something like that  of some galactic empire."</p><p>"You don't know?" Nodoka asked with a tilt of her head.  It was an amusing coincidence. Her daughter was once queen of Earth, and  was the favored granddaughter to the founder of House BlackSky.</p><p>"I fell in love with him, not his title," Sun replied  with a shrug. "At least I get a say on who is to be his second  wife."</p><p>"Second wife?" Nodoka repeated with both eyebrows  raised.</p><p>"Er, yeah," Sun stammered a bit. "You see, it's  like... tradition or something," she explained while running a finger  along the edge of the table. "The Emperor and his heirs have at least two  wives, sometimes more, but it is expected of him to have as least  two."</p><p>"I see, and how do you feel about this?" Nodoka asked  while folding her hands.</p><p>Sun shrugged her shoulders. "It's okay with me." She  then leaned forward and said in a conspiratorial voice, "I'm dropping strong  hints for Ryoko because we get... well, we get along - if you know what I  mean."</p><p>"Ryoko?" DarkStar let the name roll off her tongue.  "I think you mentioned her before when you were showing us your  pictures."</p><p>"Yes... we're close," Sun said with a slight blush.  "We have... you know - and Tenchi knows, so I kinda hoping that she'll be  the second wife."</p><p>"Ahhh... So you're bi," DarkStar said in understanding  with a wide smile. "Sounds like you want Ryoko for your own  mistress."</p><p>Sun's face flushed. "Er... well... I wouldn't mind it and,  um, it would be more fun in the bedroom."</p><p>"Oh really," DarkStar asked, glad that the conversation  moved back to one of her favorite subjects. "So, how much 'fun' have you  two had already?"</p><p>Sun's face went brilliant with embarrassment.</p><p>"That much," DarkStar said around her laughter.</p><p>"Daughter please," Nodoka said in a mirthful way.</p><p>"It's okay," Sun said after quickly composing herself.  "Ryoko and I have been making plans to take Tenchi and...," she  paused at the eager face of DarkStar and then the older woman's. Though Nodoka  wasn't really her mother, it weirded her out to talk about such things in front  of her. "Er... maybe I'll tell you later."</p><p>"Don't mind me," Nodoka said with a wave of her hand.  "Succubae normally 'talk shop' in front of their moms. Don't they  daughter?"</p><p>DarkStar nodded in confirmation. "It was especially  frustrating back when I was a virgin and my kids still asked me for  advice."</p><p>Sun eyed both women and thought for a few heartbeats. She had shared  a great deal with them already, so why not? "Well, okay," she said as  she lowered her voice further and began whispering the naughty plans that she  and Ryoko had for Tenchi.</p><p>"Are they huddled for the reason I think they are?"  Morrison asked his table-mate.</p><p>Andrea nodded. It looked like Morrison had some clue.</p><p>"... and that's what we have planned for foreplay," Sun  finished with a slightly lecherous grin.</p><p>DarkStar looked at the redhead and mused over her and Ryoko's  plans. She then studied the top of Sun's head for any signs of horns, with the  plans that she and this Ryoko came up with... "Well... it's a nice  idea," DarkStar said with a smirk, "but unless Ryoko can float in  midair... wait... nevermind. I bet she can."</p><p>"Yup, ain't it great?" Sun gushed. "Anyway, after  that, we plan on getting Tenchi to..."</p><p>"They're huddling again. Damn I wish I could listen to the  tap over there."</p><p>Andrea rolled her eyes and ignored her partner's comment.</p><p>Morison's hand went to his dog tags and the "D" mark  placed there. "Andrea , if something should happen... and I get... turned  will I sit around for hours and talk about stuff like they are?"</p><p>As Andrea looked at Morrison a smile formed. "You've seen how  Misako, Nariko, and Red act. What do you think?"</p><p>Morrison blinked. "I see." He looked at the paper he had  been pretending to read. "I guess it's still better than being  dead."</p><p>"It would be eye opening," Andrea allowed.</p><p>"... and then we plan on breaking for lunch. What do you  think?" Sun finished as she propped her head up with her arm.</p><p>"Hmmm...," DarkStar mused aloud. "Well... it's the  best you can do without tails or getting too rough. I guess you want to ease  Tenchi into the really kinky stuff- oh, nevermind, you already  started."</p><p>"Umm... right," Sun stammered a bit, "but we don't  want to wear him out too much until he builds up his stamina." Sun wagged  her eyebrows. "He already knows what I like."</p><p>"Stamina's important," DarkStar agreed, "and  eating's a great bit of foreplay." DarkStar's mind drifted back. "I  remember this one time after Kasumi hosed the blood and guts off of  me...," she voice trailed away into a pleasant memory and she sported a  dreamy smile.</p><p>Sun nodded her head. "I remember when Tenchi and I cleaned  the fridge and got quite silly. After it was all said and done, we had more  food on us than-" she stopped as she realize what DarkStar had just said.  "Blood?"</p><p>"Umm...," DarkStar started, "It was after a sortie...  my fighting style is... messy... and violent."</p><p>Sun looked at DarkStar, at the table top, and then back at her.  "Oh... I see. Well, I have a habit of vaporizing my targets."</p><p>"Where's the fun in that?" DarkStar asked  innocently.</p><p>Sun sighed heavily. "Fighting is not exactly fun...  anymore."</p><p>DarkStar stared at Sun contemplatively. "I... see. The whole  weapon thing you had going. I have problems killing humanely."</p><p>"Now dear," Nodoka said gently while laying a hand on  DarkStar's, "most of the time they die too quickly to notice."</p><p>DarkStar sighed as Sun spoke. "Killing can become too damn  easy for me if I let it," she said with a shudder.</p><p>"You too?" DarkStar looked Sun square in the eye and  took Sun's hand in hers. "Be careful, be damn careful. Look at me. I just  told you what doing <i>that</i> makes me feel."</p><p>Sun noticed the haunted look in DarkStar's eyes and stared. She  was starting to understand how much DarkStar could relate to some of her own  problems. They were both tempted.</p><p>"Have you killed a human yet?" Nodoka asked turning to  Sun.</p><p>"It's too late for me," DarkStar muttered lowly.</p><p>Sun thought a moment. "Yes," she answered. "But she  was more like a monster than a human."</p><p>"Not all monsters have fangs," DarkStar repeated,  echoing the words she spoke earlier.</p><p>"And some monsters are made," Sun added  cryptically.</p><p>Nodoka and DarkStar looked at Sun and watched as several emotions  played across her face. It was DarkStar who took the initiative. "Is it  something you what to talk about?"</p><p>Sun smiled a thin smile. "Not really," she said.</p><p>"That's okay," DarkStar stated with a wave. "As you  know, I don't have... privacy." DarkStar glanced at the surveillance  agents. "In a way it's kinda nice to be able to keep some secrets. Some  things I'm not gonna pry on."</p><p>Sun tilted her head, slightly confused.</p><p>"Don't misunderstand, I respect the hell out of these guys,  the agents, but... they all know what I am and what I've done. Even those that  haven't fought with me have seen photos and videos of me <i>working</i>. That  they can still... look me in the eye means a lot to me but..."</p><p>"They still see you as... that," Sun surmised. She  wondered what her life would be like if <i>all</i> of her fights had been  recorded and then played in front of everyone she knew and cared about. If they  saw with their own eyes what she was capable of.</p><p>"And do you want me to hear about your darkest  moments?"</p><p>Sun shook her head. "Not now...," she said. "Maybe  later... after I've fully dealt with them myself."</p><p>A certain silence fell about the table. It wasn't an uncomfortable  one, nor was it exactly peaceful. It was a type of silence that seemed to lend  a finality to the discussion.</p><p>"So," Sun coughed, breaking the silence. "I've  gotta ask before I go, what's with the hair?"</p><p>"My hair?" DarkStar blinked. "What about  it?"</p><p>"It's" Sun fumbled for an inoffensive way to say it.  "It looks... like more work than I would expect from you. It's really  long. Do you use mousse or hair spray? And how does it stay so soft looking?"</p><p>DarkStar blinked as she ran her hand through her spiked and  feathered tresses. "It's not hard, it's pretty much natural. like my  makeup." She did not want to tell Sun that it came from eating a  relatively powerful demon hunter.</p><p>Sun nodded and let out a barely audible "ah". She could  relate to "magic makeovers".</p><p>Sun took one last glance at her watch. "I need to go,"  she announced. "If I'm going to get to the Tendo's on time." She then  asked the waitress to bring her her bill. She would be relieved that she had  enough native currency to pay it.</p><p>Her table-mates nodded. "Do you need to go anywhere  special?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Not really," Sun replied. "Just somewhere where I  won't be observed... you understand."</p><p>Nodoka nodded.</p><p>"How about the restroom?" DarkStar pointed out.  "It's roomy and it is empty at the moment."</p><p>"Miss Lytle, Mr. Morrison, would you two mind ensuring our  privacy?" Nodoka called over to the two surveillance agents.</p><p>Sun nodded and rose from her seat. The others mimicked her.  "Do you mind if we see you off?" Nodoka asked. "I'm curious as  to how you travel between universes."</p><p>Sun shrugged her shoulders. "Sure. Why not?"</p><p>The three made their way to the back of the cafe. Once inside the  restroom, Sun wavered as she her outfit shifted into her Senshi uniform.</p><p>"Yep," DarkStar said, "definitely a Senshi."</p><p>Sun paused and turned to look at the demon. "Could... could I  see your uniform?"</p><p>DarkStar smiled. "Sure, but remember, it'll show my true  form."</p><p>"Uh, that's okay," Sun assured. She steeled herself.  DarkStar was a sex demon, but that still gave a lot of free range for what her  true form could be.</p><p>DarkStar closed her eyes and shadows spread from her and  transformed her clothes... and body. The demon sighed and stretched her wings  or tried too, the room was a much too small to allow for their full span.</p><p>Sun blinked. She knew that DarkStar was a demon, but this... She  stepped a bit closer and looked her up and down. The tail with its little fins,  the tiny horns, the broad wings, the luminous eyes, and the skimpy uniform  itself. "Wow," Sun said as she marveled over DarkStar's true form.  "You're... you look amazing."</p><p>"Really?" DarkStar blushed slightly. That was not the  normal reaction to seeing her true form, not by a human at least.</p><p>Curiosity getting the better of her, Sun reached out and  exploratory touched DarkStar on the shoulder, tracing her hand down the length  of her arm; it was smooth and warm - warmer than when she hugged DarkStar  earlier. "You're warm." Sun idly said.</p><p>"Well of course, I'm alive." DarkStar dryly  remarked. The demon looked at the questing hand with a raised eyebrow. Such  childlike wonderment at her form was novel.</p><p>Sailor Sun's passive scans automatically went deeper before she  consciously cut them back; at this point she thought it impolite to scan  without permission. Leaving DarkStar's shoulder and arm behind, Sun felt the  leathery wings before being drawn back to DarkStar's face. Aside from the  obvious changes in skin tone and eye color there were other differences.   DarkStar's face was a bit more severe and seemed almost... sharper - but even  with the changes, it was amazing how much they resembled one another.</p><p>Noting the little black horns that peaked through the tangled  locks of hair, Sun could not resist reaching out and touching one of them.  DarkStar gave a slight growl and pulled back. Her eyes became hard and  accusatory.</p><p>"What... what did I do?" Sun asked quickly pulling back  her hand.</p><p>"It's okay," Nodoka allowed, while she patted her  daughter on the shoulder. "You didn't know any better. Succubae are very  sensitive about who touches them."</p><p>"But, I was holding her hand and hugging her earlier,"  Sun stated in confusion. She did not expect sex demons to shy away from  physical contact.</p><p>DarkStar's expression softened but she still kept some  distance.</p><p>"She trusted you... Physical contact for them always means  something. Horns are something... more," Nodoka allowed.</p><p>Sun nodded. Though she did not exactly understand, she had the  impression that she had just made a grab for DarkStar's breasts, or crotch.  After, learning of DarkStar's nature, she would probably have been less  offended if she had tried to touch one of those areas. "I didn't  understand. I'm sorry." Sun bowed deeply.</p><p>"It's okay, you couldn't have known." DarkStar offered a  smile. Only seven, well six after what Kasumi had done, people were allowed to  touch her horns; she supposed she could let someone else. It would show her  level of trust. "If... if you really want." DarkStar leaned forward  and bowed her head.</p><p>Sun froze at the offered horns. On one hand if she declined in an  effort to be sensitive to DarkStar's situation, she might offend. If she  accepted she might screw it up. She made her decision.</p><p>As she reached out she noticed DarkStar's face twitch. On contact  the surface was mostly smooth but had some little ridges that ran up the inside  arc of the horn. She cautiously and gently ran her finger across the tip and  was surprised by the sharpness. What happened next was even more surprising. It  was a sound she had never expected to hear emanate from a version of  herself.</p><p>Sun looked to the demon's eyes, but they were closed tight. She  turned to Nodoka. "Am... am I doing this right?" DarkStar kept making  the sound deep within herself.</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "Yes, you're quite good."</p><p>"But... demons... she's..." Sun had only recently  learned that demons could be kind and loving, but that they could also...</p><p>"Yes, they purr. Normally, it only happens when they're very  happy but playing with their horns can do it too." Nodoka's smile  indicated that she had much experience with happy succubae. Her expression  became serious. "However, abusing their horns is an easy way for a  stronger succubus to dominate or even torture a weaker one."</p><p>Sun removed her hand as gently as she had placed it, and watched  as DarkStar stopped purring and opened her eyes. She straightened up and looked  the other Senshi in the eye.</p><p>"Congratulations," DarkStar said. "That's something  only my mother and children are allowed to do. Kasumi... maybe it was a bad  idea to let her do it in the first place."</p><p>"I... I think I understand," Sun said. "I'm not  going to lie to you and say I understand completely, but I think I'm starting  to grasp a few things."</p><p>The demon almost narrowed her eyes, but she assumed that the pun  was unintentional. "These things aren't decoration." DarkStar said as  she pointed to her horns. Her tone was friendly but her tail had straightened  out and was raised slightly. "We're not human. There's some similarity,  but..."</p><p>Sun noted the change in posture of the demon's tail. She had the  impression that she did something wrong again, but was not sure as to what.  Internally, Sun wished that she would stop accidentally insulting her new  friends or at least get a clue to what she was doing wrong.</p><p>"There are some things you have to experience to  understand," Nodoka noted somewhat to herself. "Things that only  another succubus will get." Her tone had gained a contemplative  edge.</p><p>DarkStar's posture became more relaxed when it became clear that  Sun's pun was unintentional and how clueless her counterpart really was. She  found herself envying Sun in a weird sort of way. Even though Sun was six years  older and had had her share of hardships in her life - some that she shied away  from and didn't want to talk about, she still was very innocent in many  ways.</p><p>To be that innocent again...</p><p>Sun looked at the two and detected that whatever faux pas that she  did had passed. She then cocked her head at DarkStar. "So wings. Are you  in super form?" Sun asked. "That's what it takes to get  mine."</p><p>"No... these are natural," DarkStar shrugged. "All  succubae have them."</p><p>"They're leather," Sun stated eyeing the wings.</p><p>"Did you expect me to have feathers?" DarkStar  smirked.</p><p>"Er, sorta?" Sun coughed.</p><p>"Angels are the ones with feathers."</p><p>"Angels?" Sun asked with a blink of her eyes. DarkStar  stared back. "I guess that makes sense." Sun shrugged her shoulders  and turned her back of the mother and daughter. "Don't be alarmed,"  she said over her shoulder. "I need to summon my sword."</p><p>Nodoka nodded as Sun did just that.</p><p>"Oh... nice flames," DarkStar noted.</p><p>"Indeed. I hope we're getting some good scans of this."  Nodoka said with awe. She then opened her cellphone. "Yes. Are we reading  this?" she asked once she connected with the observation team.  "Good."</p><p>"Er... that can tell I'm doing this?" Sun asked, holding  her sword.</p><p>"We did manage to detect your arrival and track you to  here," Nodoka reminded.</p><p>"Right. Um, just out of curiosity, what are they  reading?"</p><p>"Any inter-dimensional distortion, interference above  ambient. Any pattern registerable energy that you're giving off. That kind of  stuff. There's also whatever my daughter's sensing."</p><p>"I see," Sun nodded.</p><p>Nodoka and DarkStar watched from behind as Sun slashed at the air.  A thin glowing line was left in the wake of the sword and it hug there as is  the very air itself was cut.</p><p>They both watched as Sun used her sword to widened the hole, until  it was like a round doorway into another room. Nodoka's attention was divided  between what she was seeing and the readings on her scanner. Though the energy  that was detected earlier was large, they had now focused their scanners on  what was going in the small room. Nodoka schooled her features at the  concentrated energy that Sun was offhandedly expending.</p><p>DarkStar simply unfolded her senses and blinked a lot at what she  was seeing and <i>smelling</i>. She could see the opening and sense the power,  but she couldn't smell anything coming from the other side. It was like the  opening that also acted as a barrier.</p><p>Sun straddled the opening before crossing over to the other  side.</p><p>"See," she called to the two women. "It's that  easy."</p><p>In the open room of the studio apartment, a thin line appeared in  mid-air. It widened and a redheaded seifuku-clad young woman stepped into the  room.</p><p>"See," she called into the opening. "It's that  easy."</p><p><i>Kind of like a demonic teleport,</i> DarkStar noted to herself.  Alexia could do it from one point to another on earth, and BlackSky regularly  traveled between the earth and the Succubus Home Plane. DarkStar herself had  been toying with the concept too.<i> "But is it the same?"</i> she  mused. The difference between different universes and planes of existence was  not something she understood.</p><p>Two heads poked through the opening that Ranma was holding  open.</p><p>"This is your apartment?" the Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Yes," Ranma answered. "Tenchi isn't in right now,  but this is where we live."</p><p>"Very nice," DarkStar commented. She looked and sniffed  around the room from her vantage point and nodded her head. "Lot's of room  to work with."</p><p>Though half of their bodies were in one universe and the other  half in Sun's, there was no sensation of a barrier that been crossed. It was as  if nothing out of the ordinary was happening.</p><p>"Yeah," Sun said with uncertainty followed by an awkward  silence.</p><p>"I'm am surprised by how - unspectacular - moving between  universes is," Nodoka commented.</p><p>"That's because your universe and mine are practically  neighbors," Sun explained. "If I had traveled further in... creation,  moving through the warp would be like... ummm... like sliding through a tube  slide."</p><p>"Really?" Nodoka said. "I'm surprised our worlds  are that close. Not that inter-dimensional physics is my area."</p><p>"It's not really my specialty either," Sun admitted.  "I just do it by instinct."</p><p>While Sun and her mother conversed, DarkStar looked about the  room. Studying the sparsely furnished room, she spied something off in one  corner and smiled as she recalled something that Sun had mentioned earlier. She  looked over the stacks of tapes that were stacked under the TV and was  frustrated that she wasn't able to make out any titles clearly.</p><p>"Say... are any of those tapes the ones you mentioned  earlier?" DarkStar asked in an oh-so-innocent voice.</p><p>"Huh?" Sun said in confusion, her train of thought  derailed from her conversation with Nodoka.</p><p>"Dear, now is not the time to ask such things," Nodoka  gently chided her daughter, "she has a meeting to go to."</p><p>"Er... right," DarkStar agreed with a slight blush.  "Maybe later?" she added hopefully.</p><p>Sun blink-blinked at the two before smiling. "Well, I guess  this is goodbye," Sun said with a hint of regret.</p><p>"Will you ever visit us again?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>Sun pursed her lips in thought. "I'm not sure," she  admitted. "Tenchi really doesn't like me bopping around in different  universes, but if I explain to him, I'm sure it'll be all right."</p><p>"But you'll at least write, right?" DarkStar quipped.</p><p>"I'll see what Washu can come up with," Sun replied with  a smile.</p><p>The three stared at one another for a brief moment. As if on cue,  the three reached out across the rent in space/time and fell into a group hug.</p><p>"Thanks," Sun said as she drew away. "I really do  hope to see both of you again."</p><p>"Here," Nodoka said while handing a card to Sun.  "If you do, you'll know where to find us."</p><p>Sun looked at the WIC business card and smiled.</p><p>"When you do make it back, bring more pictures,"  DarkStar said with a grin, "and maybe a DVD or two?" She finished  with a wag of the eyebrows.</p><p>Sun blushed. "Er... right. I'll be sure to," she  answered. "Umm, I need you both to step away from the opening. I don't  want you to get hurt when I close it."</p><p>The mother and daughter stepped back, well away from the opening  as it hung in mid-air. "Goodbye," Sun said one final time as the  rounded aperture started to close. She was answered by farewell waves from the  Saotome women. With a slight, but audible 'pop' the hole sealed itself.</p><p>Then Ranma was alone in her apartment.</p><p>In the confines of the restroom, Nodoka and Sailor DarkStar faced  one another.</p><p>"Well, that was interesting," Nodoka said.</p><p>DarkStar nodded as she shifted into a form that could pass for  human. She checked herself in the mirror. "Yes it was..." She cocked  head and looked at her mother's reflection. "Do you think she'll ever come  back?"</p><p>"If she is as good at her word as you are with yours, "  Nodoka said, "I think we can expect her to show up sometime in the  future."</p><p>"More crazy family from other dimensions, eh?" Ranma  noted as she made one last check of her reflection before facing Nodoka.</p><p>"She seems more normal than your grandmother," Nodoka  noted as both women headed for the door.</p><p>"BlackSky's perfectly normal for who she is, and her gifts  are very handy," Ranma said. BlackSky was a vast resource on succubae,  especially on how to take care of their young. The value of her autobiography  alone...</p><p>"Fair enough," Nodoka said before opening the restroom door  and walking over to Andrea and Morrison and informing them of the latest  development.</p><p>After Ranma bid goodbye to her newfound friends , she stood in the  middle of the living room. Barren of any furniture, the room offered a wide  space for her to practice her forms. She smiled at the firm resolution she had  set in her mind and began moving into the kata that she had attempted earlier  in the day. Unlike earlier, she was able to almost dance through it with great  ease without having to force it.</p><p>She moved silently in the room, spinning, kicking and jabbing at  imaginary opponents before stopping before a large window that streamed  sunlight into the room. Her breathing was controlled as stood with her eyes  closed, enjoying the sun's warmth and further finding her center. She  smiled.</p><p>Gathering up her cellphone and placing it in her purse, Ranma  opened the creaking front door and looked about the apartment's interior. Yes,  she was nervous, but she moved down the stairs with a purpose - her mind made  up. She entered the sidewalk and looked about the new day. Exhaling through  pursed lips, she muttered softly, "Well today, I face my past."</p><p>Heading to the bus stop, she began her journey to a place she  hadn't visited in over six years.</p><p>"It will be a few minutes until everyone gets pulled  back," Nodoka said as she returned to the table and asked the waitress to  clear off the third cup and give them their portion of the bill.</p><p>Ranma sat down next to her mother and sighed as she fingered her saucer.</p><p>"You feeling any better?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>Ranma smiled. "Yeah, yeah I think I am." She reached out  and put her hand on her mother's "What about you?"</p><p>"I think it's time to finish what I had started ten years  ago." Nodoka then ordered another coffee. She would do whatever it took to  help her daughter. In that regard, divorcing Genma was an easy decision. It was  the easier of the two decisions she faced today. The other was still being  considered</p><p>"That's good. You don't know how much having a mother like  you means to me."</p><p>Nodoka hugged her daughter. "I'm just doing my best. I  haven't sacrificed nearly as much as you."</p><p>"You accepted me," Ranma assured. "That's more than  anyone can ask for." Ranma looked into her mother's eyes. "And I know  you would do whatever you needed to."</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "So, how are you going to talk to Usagi?"  she asked after getting and paying for the bill.</p><p>"Once I figure out what to say. How to even mention this to  her," DarkStar finished off her tea and looked to her mother, who,  naturally, met her gaze. "You'll make sure I'm not going to put this  off?"</p><p>"Of course," Nodoka caught the wave from Morrison and  looked to see that a van had pulled up to the front door of the shop.  "Going to be quite the story to tell your kids," Nodoka noted as they  walked out of the store.</p><p>"Complete with pictures," Ranma laughed while holding up  the digital camera.</p><p>Omake by <b>J St C Patrick</b></p><p>There you are," a voice called out. "How is  everything?"</p><p>Both Ranmas looked up at the newcomer. She was very familiar to  both of them.</p><p>"Hi Mom," DarkStar said with a smile. "Every  thing's fine. We were talking about - stuff."</p><p>"I see," the older redhead said with a warm smile while  eyeing the human-Ranma. "And who do we have here? Our wayward  Senshi?"</p><p>"Um, Mom, I'd like to introduce you to... Ranma,"  DarkStar said a little nervously. "Er, Ranma this is my mom. Um, Mom,  Ranma's from somewhere else."</p><p>"So I gathered," Nodoka said dryly still maintaining her  warm smile as she slid into the seat across from DarkStar and addressed Sun.  "So, you're just visiting? Do you have anything to declare? Fruit?  Alcohol? Firearms? No? Well then, Welcome to Canada!"</p><p>DarkStar and Sun looked and each other, then back at the older  women before bursting into a fit of giggles.</p><p>Nodoka Saotome, Mother, W.I.C. Scientist, Customs  Agent.</p><p>End Interlude</p><p>We'd like to thank our pre-readers. They're the ones that made  sure this story was readable. DGC, Questara, Kevin Hammel, J St C Patrick, Pale  Wolf, Wray, and Jerry Starfire. It's  great to have a group that we've built years of trust with and will take their  time and effort to help us.</p><p>Thank you all.</p><p>Interestingly, this was written well before Strained Harmony was  even conceived.</p><p>We were talking about our respective characters meeting. The idea  stuck and we started writing it out, last spring.</p><p>There was one problem: The Return was nowhere near far enough  along to post this. So it had to wait for more chapters of Return to be  written.</p>
