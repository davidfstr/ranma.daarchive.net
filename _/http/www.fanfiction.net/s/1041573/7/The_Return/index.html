</div><p>A Brief History of the Company</p><p>Josh Temple</p><p>Disclaimer at the End</p><p>A slight  warning.  It is advisable to read all of  the currently released chapters of The Return <i>before</i> reading this text.  Go  now and read it.  A big part of the early  chapters was to find out just what the Company was and this would ruin it.</p><p>This text  is simply to put the Company in some more context.</p><p>It began in  a small logging town in Shepard's Creek, New Hampshire.  The local sawmills and most of the  timberlands were owned by the Willard family. In 1840, the wife of the head of  the Willard family, Susan Willard, had borne a son, Johan.</p><p>It became  apparent that young Johan was unwilling to takeover his father's  company.  With some reluctance, Stanley  allowed his eldest son to attend university in Boston.  It was there that he studied physics and  mechanics, and it was there in 1861 that he enlisted in the Union Army.</p><p>Because of  his education,  Johan was sent to the  artillery corps to calculate range books for cannons and mortars.  There were collections of tables that allowed  artillery-men to figure out the angle of elevation and powder charge  needed to lob a shell of a specific weight a specific  distance.  Although once the books were  completed, Johan's unit was moved closer to the front as to inspect  cannons for damage and wear, and repair their carriages, wheels, and firing  mechanisms if damaged. If the barrel itself got damaged they would simply send  it to be melted down into a new one.</p><p>It was May  of 1865, the war had been won.  Johan and  his unit had returned to Boston.  At the  time, a flu was sweeping through the city.   Johan managed to catch a rather bad case of it.</p><p>Bedridden with the illness at a  friend's house, Johan managed to read an article about a perplexing  disappearance in the woods of New Hampshire.   A team of loggers returning to Shepard's Creek found a deserted  village.  Local police have no idea what  happened to the two hundred plus residents. They found no bodies and only small  amounts of blood and other stranger fluids of unknown, yet organic,  descent.  The police also found a large  number of bullet holes and strange notes scrawled in journals and on walls.</p><p>As Johan  recovered from his illness, he did nothing other than study the investigation.  Using his status as the only Willard not missing, he had daily correspondence  with the constable in charge and a local doctor that had been called up for  when - if - the townsfolk were found.</p><p>Eventually,  the story died down and was forgotten by the newspapers.  By that time, Johan had recovered and was  exploring his hometown with the help of friends from his time in the army and  at university.</p><p>As the sole  heir to Willard Timber, Johan was more than able to fund his  investigation.  Heeding the advice of the  locals, they only went into the town during the daylight and always in groups  of no less than six people, all heavily armed.   The search that these soldiers and scientists conducted was the most  thorough and in-depth forensic study to date.   Their notes, photographs, and samples are still kept in the Company  archives.</p><p>Eventually,  they found a trail leading from the town to a series of caverns.  There, Johan and the others found the bones  of over a dozen people.  As they  conducted the examination of the cave, they found a series of tunnels leading  further down beneath the earth.  Night  began to approach, so the team left and went back to their base camp.</p><p>It had  become obvious that something had eaten the residents of Shepard's  Creek.  During their investigation, Johan  and his associates had interviewed locals as to what had happened.  There was also the strange bloods and fluids  that had been left in the town, still being analyzed in the laboratory, not to  mention the scrawled note referring to "a skittering, membranous, furred  lobster" and "a mass of hissing lumpy oil."  They knew that they were facing some sort of  hideous beast or beasts.</p><p>The next  day, Johan decided to arm his men with grenades, revolvers, and repeating  rifles, and explore the cave tunnels.   All the men going into the tunnels had been soldiers, seeing the  indescribable horrors of the War Between the States.  Johan had also brought a cartload of  nitroglycerin and black powder and left some at the mouth of the cavern. He  would have used dynamite but that would not have been invented for another  year. The rest was brought with the exploration team. He had told the men he  had left up top to blow up the cave if anything –unusual –tried to  escape.</p><p>Their  torches lead them deeper into the cavern until they found a –nest for  lack of a better word.  It was a large  circular chamber that looked to be filled with a brackish sludge.  The surface was doted with dozens of large  white ovals. Johan remarked later that the pods resembled giant five foot  strands of rice and seemed strangely animate as they floated.</p><p>It is not  clear as to what happened next, but it is known that Johan and his men saw  something emerge from within its vile concavity.  Later on, no one could give a clear  recollection as to what had risen out of that pool of muck and ooze, except for  a vague anthropoid-like shape, and more importantly a sense of wrongness, that  this was a thing-that-should-not-be.</p><p>Two of  Johan's men opened fire.  Their  maxi-balls tore through the creature's thick head carapace, which issued  a thick ichor eerily similar to the substance that  the monster had wallowed in.</p><p>The men  fled from the monstrosity, waiting only long enough to drop their black powder  charges and ignite their fuses. Two of Johan's team fell, their  screams slowly degenerating into gurgles and  crunches.  As they ran out of the cave,  Johan had his topside men trigger the charges.</p><p>The rocky  knob that served as the entrance to the cave collapsed in on itself in a  shattering implosion that formed an oblong cavity.  Johan and his friends had their weapons at  the ready waiting for the <i>thing</i> to  emerge. The strange ichor did ooze up into the  cavity, which was then doused in a mixture of oil and gunpowder and set ablaze.</p><p>It was  looking into this smoldering pit, hearing the alien screeches of the dying  thing, that Johan and his friends made an oath.   Never Again.  They did not know  the extent of what they faced.  They did  not understand exactly what they were up against.  But they knew they had to <i>fight</i>.</p><p>In their  research on the Shepard's Creek massacre, they had found stories of other  missing towns, whole convoys vanishing,   piles of mysterious bones, and other such silent horrors.  It was more than could have been explained by  Indian attack, battle, or people simply getting lost.  There was a distinct force that was preying  on humanity, and these soldiers and scientists had stumbled onto it.</p><p>For two  weeks, they continued the examination of the area.   After that, they returned to Boston and  continued their research.  Friends wrote  to friends and quiet inquiries were made.   Arms, tools, and scientific instruments were slowly purchased as  Johan's organization grew and took shape.</p><p>Then in  1870, five years after the expedition to Shepard's Creek, the Willard Investigative  Company opened its doors.  Like the  Pinkerton Detective Agency, WIC, or the Company, as it is still called today,  consisted of teams of private investigators hired out to businesses,  municipalities, or citizens.</p><p>Unlike the  twenty year old Pinkerton investigators, the Company specialized in missing  persons cases, specifically those of unusual circumstance or number.  The Company also prided itself on having the  latest in technology to assist its investigations.  They were among the first to use electric  lights, audio recorders, wireless radios, motion cameras, not to mention the  advances in armaments over the years.</p><p>One would  like to hope that the Company held up its oath, that the intrepid teams of  scientist-warriors met their foes and dispatched them while saving innocent  lives. The truth is that all too often, brave teams of men willing to give  their lives for this cause did.  In the  archives, there are scores of failed missions.   Ones where every single man sent out was killed.</p><p>When asked of  the risks his men took, Johan, by now in his fifties, said that every creature  that mutilated, raped, or killed humans, that was destroyed made the nation  that much safer, that every cult of degenerates that worshiped these twisted  beings that was broken up and dispatched, and that every piece of information  gathered, made up for every death, widow, and orphan created when men did not  return.</p><p>Throughout  the first  forty years of its existence,  the Company was purely a reactive force.   It would only come to a town after people started to go missing or when  the unspeakably mutilated bodies began to show up.  Only after people started to die would the  Company come to town in one of its train-mounted mobile headquarters and  laboratories.</p><p>Towards the  middle of the second decade of the twentieth century, Company leadership  decided to take a more informative role in their job.  It was felt that the truth would be too  destructive.  There was a belief that the  public would become irrevocably paranoid at the knowledge of what lurks in the  shadows.  There was also the opinion that  if humanity were to openly hunt its opposition, the horrors would respond in  kind.</p><p>Yet they  still wanted to inform the public, to warn those that would listen about what  could happen, to distribute the warning signs of a dangerous situation, and to  tell others what they could do in the event of finding such a situation.</p><p>The Company  found a promising writer.  A young man  familiar with the fledgling horror genre.   An author with the ability to descriptively and rationally describe  horrific monstrosities.</p><p>The thirty  six year old Rhode Islander was intrigued by the trio of detectives that had  entered his house.  The eldest flipping  through admirably complete collections of <i>The Scientific Gazette</i> and <i>The Rhode Island Journal of  Astronomy</i>.  Both hectographed journals had been produced  in his childhood and had been only released to his friends.  The detective also had copies of manuscripts,  only one of which had been published, the rest of them had been sent to the  writer's friends in correspondence.</p><p>His  indignation at having his privacy violated was tempered by his curiosity.  Who were these men and why did they seem so  impressed and professional with his stories, especially <i>The Alchemist, The Mystery of the Graveyard, </i>and<i> The Beast in the Cave</i>?  Reaching into his briefcase, the senior  detective pulled out what looked to be several bound journals and handed them  to the young New Englander.  The writer  took them and started to read.  When he  finished, he looked up at the grim faces of the three detectives and uttered  six words: I think I can help you.</p><p>It is of  interesting note that in 1917  H.P  Lovecraft changed not only the frequency of his writing, but the style as  well.  What had been fragmentary  collections of paragraph sized chapters like <i>The Mysterious Ship </i>or<i> The  Mystery of the Graveyard</i>, or equally short collections of thick paragraphs  as in <i>The Little Glass Bottle </i>or<i> The Secret Cave</i>, suddenly changed.</p><p>Some who  study Lovecraft's works would account this to his developing skills in  his craft such his increasing potency in his use of a personal log style of  writing.  He managed to convey horror not  by simply stating the supernatural, but by having rational, learned people  confront things from beyond the normal scope of man.</p><p>Critical to  this was a sense of reality, an impression that these impossible events and  creatures were actually happening.  It  would seem that Lovecraft excelled at the suspension of disbelief, a quality  all the more necessary given his unusual subject matter.</p><p>There are  some who have suspicions as to the sources of his material.  There are those who will say that while there  never was a Red Hook in New York City, there was an eerily similar cult in  South-Boston.</p><p>There is  also the matter of the Innsmouth Massachusetts.  Lovecraft writes of a "strange and  secret" government investigation of the town in the winter of  1927-1928.  While it is true that there  never was a federal intervention of that nature in the town's history,  and equally true that said winter was quite uneventful, the spring of 1914 was  another matter entirely.</p><p>Municipal  records account for a series of surprisingly large fees paid out to an  undisclosed investigative company.  Local  papers of the time also record of strangely disfigured bodies washing onto  shore and being caught in fishermen's nets, not to mention strange  explosions emanating to the North of the town.</p><p>It is also  true that many of the dread tomes he wrote of were purely fictions, books such  as T<i>he Eltdown Shards, The Necronomicon,</i>  and <i>The Pnakotic Manuscripts</i>. However several  of the tomes he wrote about can actually be found in certain universities and  museums such as <i>De Vermis Mysteriis</i>  by Ludvig Prinn, <i>Nameless  Cults</i> by Friedrich von Junzt, and <i>Kryptographik</i> by Johan Ludwig Kluber.</p><p>Those of a  rational bent will look at these and several other cases and simply point to  coincidence and dedicated research on Lovecraft's part. However, there  are others who believe that Lovecraft's own interest and research in  these events are not enough to account for the depth of his knowledge.  These people enjoy pointing to arcane  references made in Lovecraft's notes consisting of lists of three digit  numbers, some of which consisted of five blocks.</p><p>Of the  meeting that took place in the spring of 1926, there is no mention, although  the exact contents of that meeting could explain much.  According to Company records, the young  author needed little encouragement.  He  seemed delighted with this new source of information, and used it to it's  fullest.  The security procedures were  not a problem either.  Many of the event  reports Lovecraft read were too dry or fragmentary to make entertaining short  stories.  A good part of them were too  gruesome even for <i>Weird</i> <i>Tales,</i> his preferred publication.  But the accounts did make an excellent point  to start from.</p><p>He seemed  to think it a great jest to exchange elements of his "mythos" with  those of other authors.  It was quite  easy make a reference to a character or item that another writer had mentioned  before, and another connection is made interlinking a great body of work.  Lovecraft entertained asking what <i>assistance</i> his contemporaries received  in their writing but always abstained, fearful of what the quiet, grim Company  men would do if he violated their agreement.</p><p>When Lovecraft passed on in 1937, no  attempt was made by the Company to replace him with another author. Lovecraft's  creations still enjoyed their popularly, and often obscurity.  In the years following the author's death,  the Company instead relied on rumors and reports that they themselves leaked as  a form of specially tailored misinformation.</p><p>For the  first seventy years of it's existence, the Company had roughly the same  methodology.  Its investigators continued  to use the latest in technology and weaponry.   The Thompson machinegun and the Mills bomb, invented in 1915, it was the  first safe (for the person throwing it) hand grenade, proved to be exceedingly  useful.</p><p>More  importantly however, developments in electrical machines, optics, photography,  and biology allowed for the first comprehensive cataloging system of various  enemy forces - the precursor of our current Pattern Identification System.  This version required over six hundred pounds  of equipment and a team of four technicians and had  only a sixty percent accuracy.</p><p>The Company investigators in their  charcoal suits resembled federal agents more than anything else.  Being mistaken for the G-men was something  Company investigators were always willing to use to their advantage.</p><p>Then the  Second World War began to heat up.  In  it's official capacity, the Company had little involvement in the Great  War some years previous.  Some  investigators were sent to France on the rumors of  Pattern Z's being loose in the  trenches.  The rumors of the Hun's  using undead warriors were just that.</p><p>The Nazis  were another matter.  Hitler's  interest in the occult was matter of public record.  He sent troops on missions to the Holy Land  looking for the chalice of Christ, the Lance of Longius,  and pieces of the True Cross.  He also  invested time researching German mysticism to lend credence to his eugenics and  Aryan supremacy.  For a time he employed  astrologers  to prophesize the strength  and victories of his Thousand Year Reich, until he had them all killed for  practicing the newly illegal, subversive, and Zionist trade of astrology.</p><p>What was  not known, what had been kept secret for now over sixty years, more closely  than the German Nuclear Program and how near they were to having the Bomb, more  than Japan's Unit 731, (a biological warfare research facility in  occupied Manchuria that killed nearly a quarter of a million Chinese)...</p><p>If the war had been prolonged a little bit  longer, Germany could have had nuclear tipped V2's and the U-boats to  launch them, Japan could have used its submersible mini-carriers to launch  biological attacks on the cities of the American west coast.</p><p>Having  Allied cities infected, irradiated, and vaporized were not the highest of  risk.  More importantly were certain  treaties being signed by the Axis powers.   Top spies in Germany had brought back information of certain alliances being  made, rumors of pacts between the Nazis and –other powers.</p><p>The War Department knew of one organization  with the experience to help them deal with this threat.  The Company signed a contract with the United  States military to provide "consulting on matters pertaining to specific  enemy activities, to be defined as necessary, for the duration of the  war."</p><p>The Company  trained investigative teams.  It was here  that the Company changed from styling itself as a private investigative company  to a paramilitary organization.  They had  contact with the British Special Air Service, the American Ranger battalions,  the Office of Strategic Services, and other such organizations.</p><p>The war  progressed and Allied Command deployed the Company trained, Army Special Investigative  units with greater frequency, until the fall of   1943, when "activities of note" among the Germans decreased  to nearly nothing.  This is not to say  the ASI units  were idle.</p><p>As territory was liberated, the  scale of Nazi atrocities became all to clear.   The deathcamps were opened, the laboratories  were shown, the endless piles of cataloged body parts were recorded, but not  everything was shown to the public.  One  such discovery that to this day remains hidden in an Army archive, is a cache  of film canisters hidden in a root cellar found near the German-Austrian  border.  They contain several hundred  hours of footage of Nazi super-solider experiments.  It was their plan to create a hybrid species  using transfusions and transplants.</p><p>The success  of these experiments was well known to the ASI troopers, most had either fought  or been called upon to catalog and dissect German soldiers of "unusual  tenacity and constitution."</p><p>As the war  closed, the ASI units got the attention of their allies in Soviet Russia.  Stalin had formed the People's Commissariat  of Internal Affairs (NKVD) in 1936.  It  was based on an older organization, the OGPU.   The NKVD were the secret police.   They answered only to Stalin himself and had no obligation to obey any  standing civil laws.  This was the tool  Stalin used for his purges of political opponents, mass arrests, and the  elimination or exile of undesirables.</p><p>The USSR  was, and Russia still is, an immensely large country.  It is mostly wilderness and there are vast  tracts of land to the east that are still unexplored.  It is a place where obscene numbers of people  disappear frequently, and bodies are found with less frequency.  Upon learning of fascist relation with  certain entities, Stalin, in his classic paranoia, feared the subversion of  such entities in his country.</p><p>A special  department of the NKVD was created one to "combat those that seek to  undermine the state and destroy the people regardless of their form and  origin." They were not created to hid themselves from the public or  control information.  The Soviet  government had enough of that.  This  department was made to maintain the secret from other government agencies and  to place form one cohesive force specially trained to deal with the threat.</p><p>They would  identify and eliminate any suspicion activity, and eliminate anybody at risk of  contamination.  It was at their orders  that farms were set on fire, towns shelled by artillery, and, whole swaths of  land reduced to a moonscape.  When the  NKVD was succeeded by the Committee for State Security (KGB)  in 1946, this department made a smooth  transition and a permanent place among the "Sword and Shield of the  Party".</p><p>The war was  over, but the enemy that the Company fought was still there.  The military reduced it's size,  discharged men, and dismantled much of its armor, ships, and planes.  Most former ASI soldiers were approached by  Company recruiters.  They were offered a  job where they could apply the skills they had learned.  A very sizable fraction accepted.  Coupled with the generous fees they had  collected during the war and the military surplus that allowed them to supply  and equip this new personnel, the Company dramatically increased its power and  influence.  Tripling the number of  personnel and doubling the number of basses.</p><p>Renaming  itself Willard International Consulting, the Company became one of countless  American firms that worked the occupied countries, helping with the  reconstruction.  It was then that the  Company moved it's headquarters from western Massachusetts to (what would  later become the first Operations Centre) the outskirts of Topeka, Kansas.</p><p>The Company  also changed it's overt method of operation.  Ostensibly an international consulting  firm,  WIC called itself a government  funded think-tank, defense contractor. It was a fitting cover.  What better way to explain the <i>special</i> relationship the Company had  with the US military than to have them working for them?</p><p>To the  general public, WIC was just another Northrop, Boeing, Harris, or Lockheed-Martian.  They were just one that specialized in  integrating systems for military use.  It  was WIC that developed the earliest methods for helicopter strategy and how to  combine their abilities with existing military hardware.</p><p>As a  military contractor it was expected for the Company to have a working  relationship with not only the military, but also with certain intelligence  agencies. The secrecy their organization and employees operated under was also  expected.</p><p>This is not  to say that the secret of the Company was never leaked.  That would be impossible given the size and  age of the organization.  Ever since the  latter quarter of the nineteenth century, roughly every decade or so some  enterprising reporter broke the story of the Company.</p><p>The newsman  would tell a riveting story of mysterious agents that worked in for an agency  that had no governmental oversight.  He  would always mention the focused, almost robotic agents this organization had  that, depending on the time period, wore grey suits, black dusters and fedoras,  green molted fatigues, black on black suits, business casual wear, or black and  grey counter-terrorism ninja suits.</p><p>The reason  none of these stories became earth shattering was how they could never bridge  the gap between being obscure and boring, or outlandish and simply  unbelievable.  The reporter either had a  story on a military contractor that was conducting operations with the military  in a vaguely illegal way, or a secretive paramilitary organization that had  spent many, many years fighting eldritch horrors.</p><p>The most  credible story breaking the Company's true purpose sourced a full hour of video  footage that was shot on October 12th  of  1973. This tape contained footage of Company agents eliminating a group of  Pattern L's.  Unfortunately for the news  team that had made the tape, they had questionable credibility going into this,  and the media elites doubted the tape's authenticity.</p><p>People in  journalism have a sense that they understand how the world <i>really,</i> works and when something shows up that challenges their  views, they deny it's existence or try to discredit the source.  This is not just restricted to the  paranormal.</p><p>Several  networks did play the tape.  It made for  good copy.  It had plenty of action and  blood, and since it was not <i>real,</i>  there was less concern about it's highly graphic nature.  Instead of concentrating on what was on the  tape, the media tried to find out what film studio was responsible for making  this action sequence.  The networks  eventually concluded that it was a publicity stunt pulled by a new special  effects company that was trying to sell its name.</p><p>It did not  matter that this answer made little sense. The name of the special effects  company was never mentioned.  No company  was mentioned.  The uniforms of the  soldiers bore no logos.  And no one took  credit for the footage on the tape.</p><p>It was  still an answer. One that the media thought was   simple and easy enough for their viewers to grasp. Copies of this tape  are still in circulation. In the end, the media's complacency, bias, and a  refusal to acknowledge the existence of certain creatures was what protected  the Company.</p><p>This is not  to say that a sufficiently public event would not break the secret.  If a large attack conducted by clearly  inhuman entices were to be captured by a news team and broadcast live, the  secret would be out.  It might just be  the secret of paranormal invaders fighting against humanity.</p><p>That  Willard International Consulting was one of the leading organizations that  combated these <i>things</i> might not break  out.  An enterprising reporter could  correlate the locations that WIC was active in with areas where paramilitary  forces had fought such monsters.</p><p>In the  event of public knowledge of Pattern Registering Entities and the various human  cults that support them, the Company would be more concerned with the  opposition's reaction than their own cover. With their secrecy gone, certain  opposition elements may decide to declare an open war on humanity.</p><p>A sudden  and worldwide surge in nonhuman activity is one of several scenarios that the  Company has developed contingency plans for.     This was one of the main reasons that WIC had cultivated a close  relationship with not just the United States military, but other organizations  as well.</p><p>Much like it's  training of Army Special Investigative teams during the Second World War, the  Company is currently involved in providing information, training, and weapons  designs to conventional military forces.</p><p>One of the  most critical devices the Company sells and licenses out  are their pattern scanners.  These devices are the culmination of decades  and decades of data taken on thousands of missions.</p><p>Their most  popular model is the Nordstar series personal mount  that is under five pounds and has a headset-mounted viewing picture. The  Company also has their Ostar series of vehicle- and  base-mount long range scanners. This technology is only sold to the governments  and organizations that the Company has had a long standing and friendly  relationship with. However if the need arose, such devices could easily be mass  produced.</p><p>Recently,  the Company has given a small number of their   inter-dimensional jammers to an Air Force working group.  The threat posed to a extremely mobile enemy  was described in a RAND Corporation, WIC, and NORAD study entitled: Reactions  and Countermeasures to Multiple-Point Invasion of Unusual Means and  Penetration. For brevity this study was referred to as Rack Pump.</p><p>Like many papers  of it's kind, such as those detailing the appropriate US response <i>after</i> a nuclear exchange with the Soviet  Union, it was mostly speculation and some educated guesses.  Naturally, WIC provided the hard evidence and  potential technology for the report, the NORAD team observed the problem from a  Command and Control Perspective, and the RAND team developed a way to implement  the planned system.</p><p>Behind the  jargon, Rack Pump was simply the US response to a coordinated attack  perpetrated by an enemy with access to... teleportation or some other ability  which allowed them to bypass conventional defenses.</p><p>Currently,  the Company maintains its stance war against various enemies of humanity.  Among the private organizations and  government agencies that share the same field as Willard International  Consulting there is a sense of urgency.   Sightings of and crimes committed by Pattern Registering Entities was on  the rise, and membership in cults that assist them had also increased.</p><p>Theories as  to what this means are diverse and often conflicting.  The general consensus is that the opposition  has gotten sick of being hunted and executed by mere humans and that they are  planning a massive counter attack.   Whatever it is, the Company is the organization best equipped to handle  it.</p><p>Preparations  are underway.  This includes the  construction of a new facility in the Toronto metropolitan area, attempts to  expand their alliances, and increasing the number of archaeological digs they  conduct on early-human and pre-human civilizations. Willard International  Consulting will go to any length to ensure that humanity is not destroyed.</p><p>Disclaimer:  Willard  International Consulting is my own creation. However within it's history,  methodology, and culture are nods to several other sources.  Of historical note are a few novels written  by Dean Koontz (think of what happened in Shepard's Creek), the creative works  and life of H.P. Lovecraft, and a few books by Steven King.</p><p>Inspiration for the Company itself comes from numerous  places:  Tom Clancy's Rainbow  organization,  NERV, MIB, the Hellsing Institute, the Centre,  The Shop from <i>Firestarter</i>, and Stargate  Command.</p><p>Prereaders for this are Wray, Joe Fenton, and Jakub.</p>
