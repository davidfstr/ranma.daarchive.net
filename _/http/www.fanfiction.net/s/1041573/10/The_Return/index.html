</div><p>The Return</p><p>A Ranma Sailor Moon fic thingy.</p><p>By Josh Temple</p><p>Naturally, I own neither Sailor Moon nor Ranma. So here's the  disclaimer</p><p>Ranma 1/2 and its characters and settings belong to Rumiko  Takahashi, Shogakukan, Kitty, and Viz Video. Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon  belongs to Naoko Takeuchi, Koudansha, TV Asahi, and Toei Douga, and DIC.</p><p>Previous chapters and other works can  be found at my</p><p>C&amp;C as always is wanted.</p><p>Chapter 9 Revenge and Rebirth Part 1</p><p>"Section  Chief Tofu completed the autopsies," Jacob said as he dropped a thick  folder onto Stillwater's desk.</p><p>The WIC  commander picked it up and started to skim the report. Later, he would read it  more thoroughly. "I thought that the demons there were pretty weak."</p><p>"Yes,  the highest was a Class 5 that one of Miss Saotome's brood killed," Jacob  agreed.</p><p>"Though  her kids are progressing well," Stillwater noted. The agent paused to find  the appropriate word. "Any... <i>personal</i>  requirements they need addressed?"</p><p>Jacob  allowed a slight smile to form. "Sir, if you're asking whether or not the  brood needs some... male companionship? The answer's no. Besides, I'm fairly  certain Miss Saotome doesn't swing that way."</p><p>"But  no women for her either?" Stillwater asked, a hint of amusement entering  his voice. He knew that succubae tended to have no personal gender preference when  it came to feeding on humans. Males were just much more susceptible to their  charms.</p><p>"She  has an impressive amount of control. Plus, Miss Saotome's got another way to  release stress and gather energy." Jacob chuckled slightly.</p><p>"Good,  we don't need more complications," Stillwater nodded. "We've  confirmed that this was Alexia's brood. But we didn't get her, and I suspect  that her stronger minions are still alive," Stillwater said as his eyes  lingered on the photographs of the demons that had been killed by other demons.</p><p>"I  agree with that assessment. I'd be very surprised if that was the extent of her  brood. Her continued existence will be a complication. As is the Assembly  presence. We must also watch Murdock more closely. At least we stamped out the Pattern  V's in the forests to the south of the city." Jacob added.</p><p>"Yes,  I'd be very interested to know who Murdock's working for," Stillwater  sighed as he stroked his goatee. "Clearly, these groups are here for much  the same reason we are."</p><p>"And  they will be after the Pattern Silvers too."</p><p>"Likely.  The documentation unearthed and translated by Historical Research Section seems  to indicate that the Silvers are key in both forestalling the cataclysm or  bringing it to its ultimate end."</p><p>"A  part of me still hopes that this all just the deluded ramblings of  madmen," Jacob said, shaking his head.</p><p>"Sadly,  we've both seen too much to discount it entirely. This is cyclical in nature,  and current events are starting to match past ones."</p><p>"A  hundred and ten years ago it was nothing more than a bright light observed by  loggers in the Yukon. Eighty-seven years ago it was just a thousand acres of  destruction in northern Montana. Forty-two years ago the Company lost nearly  two hundred men and barely contained the situation.</p><p>"And  it was only five years ago that HR discovered the connection between those  events," Jacob explained, using the abbreviation for Historical Research  section. Willard International Consulting also had a Human Resources  department. A commonality that caused more than some confusion.  "Eventually, they managed to convince Command that the risk warranted this  level of resources, and here we are."</p><p>"Yes  and other... recent events have lent credibility to that... prophecy,"  Stillwater said, showing clear distaste for the last word. The only reason he,  and the majority of Command, put stock in the scenario was the mass of evidence  that seemed to confirm it.</p><p>"This  time, I fear our own abilities will be insufficient. Our jammers can only do so  much; our own weapons are not designed for this task. The energy increase is  exponential in nature. We need the Pattern Silvers," Jacob explained.</p><p>"You're  not proposing full disclosure?" Stillwater asked with some annoyance.</p><p>Jacob shook  his head. "There's no need, Sir. They'll do whatever it takes to stop it  of their own free will. They are the good guys after all," the agent said  with a slight smile.</p><p>"Provided  that this event is not key to their own plans for the future," Stillwater  warned.</p><p>"If a  global calamity of the scale foretold was a part of their plans, then we have  more than this event to worry about." Jacob shook his head. He had read  the reports from Historical Research. The accounts, if they were to be  believed, of an interplanetary civilization dominated by the Pattern Silvers  and the possibility of its return were... disturbing.</p><p>"That  would make the Pattern Silvers the enemy," Stillwater said in a cold  voice.</p><p>"I  know. WIC is charged with protecting humanity from <i>all</i> threats of a Pattern Registering Nature," Jacob sighed. He  hoped that it would not have to come to that, but he was pragmatic enough to  face that possibility and to have contingency plans for it.</p><p>"This  is not the first time the Company has faced cataclysm, and it will <i>not </i>be the last. We will stop this  threat. The alternative is unacceptable. The world will not end in <i>either</i> way Robert Frost said it  would," Stillwater stated.</p><p>" 'Fire or Ice,' " Jacob  responded giving the title. He suppressing a sigh. Stillwater was almost  obsessed with that poem.</p>-oo0oo-<p>Kasumi  approached the dojo. Her mug was in her left hand and her right rested just  above her waist. It was natural for her to keep her free arm at the ready. The  agent entered without knocking.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed  at the sight of her sister being attacked by the succubus' mate. Akane blocked  Nariko's arms and tried to use her legs to sweep the taller girl off her feet.</p><p>Nariko  tumbled backwards but used her wings to regain her balance. Akane closed in and  tried to tackle her mate, but found her stomach being tapped by Nariko's tail.  Akane frowned but continued on and embraced Nariko.</p><p>"You've  got to keep track of your opponent's tail. Even if it just grazes you, it'll be  very damaging," Ranma said as she looked down at her cuddling daughters.</p><p>"I  know; it's just that my training has been for people who don't have  tails." Akane frowned before lightly kissing Nariko.</p><p>"Yes,  you've been sparring like a human. But we're not... limited in that way. Look  at Nariko; she used her wings to keep from falling. Nice work there,  honey," Ranma complimented.</p><p>"Thanks  Mommy," Nariko said, her skin reddening almost imperceptibly in what  passed for a blush in her species.</p><p>"But I  can still fight like a demon," Akane said, remembering her first battle:  the killing, the draining, the feeding.</p><p>"We're  going to do more than that. I learned martial arts as a human too. But we need  to adjust to our new bodies."</p><p>"Planning  on making Saotome Anything Goes a truly aerial art?" Kasumi interjected as  she considered the possibilities. Ranma's brood had considerable potential.</p><p>"Yes,  though it's not too different really. One of the key points of musabetsu  kakutou is learning to adapt to any advantage or disadvantage, including extra  body parts," Ranma said as she stretched her wings slightly.</p><p>"Good,"  Kasumi nodded. "Cute... spandex," the agent commented on the garments  the brood was wearing. They were in  matching low-backed and sleeveless unitards that went to mid-thigh.  Akane's was deep blue and white, Nariko's was black and violet, and Ranma's was  dark purple and red.</p><p>"Lycra  actually," Akane said, pointing out the minor difference in the materials.  She had gotten up off the floor and was as putting her straps back on her  shoulders.</p><p>"With  our wings and tails, it's practical," Ranma shrugged.</p><p>The agent  nodded. "I heard you're going back to school tomorrow," Kasumi  stated.</p><p>"Yeah,  they've done alright in the mall and other places," Ranma said before  telling her kids what kata they should practice.</p><p>"And  Akane's cover story?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>As she  watched her daughters' forms, Ranma gave a brief explanation.</p><p>"Impressive,"  Kasumi noted. The story was simple and close to the truth. Akane had been  injured very badly. She was recovering. The experience had changed her life and  Akane had decided to stop hiding who she <i>really</i>  was.</p><p>"Mom  helped... and Jacob," Ranma added. "Nari-chan, keep your left leg  straighter," the redhead then advised the other demoness. She watched as  Nariko tried the sequence again. Shaking her head, Ranma walked over to her  daughter to help.</p><p>"I  like how it takes care of her hair color, pale skin, and mate."</p><p>"Mother  says I shouldn't call Nari-chan that," Akane said as she practiced a kata  that was familiar except for the bit involving her wings that Mother added.</p><p>"Girlfriend  would attract less attention," Ranma confirmed before turning back to her  older daughter. "That's it. Very good."</p><p>"Thanks,  Mommy," Nariko beamed.</p><p>"My  friends seemed to like Nari-chan," Akane recalled. The blue and  silver-haired succubus' first impression of Nariko was amazement at a sane, but  air-headed, member of the Kuno family.</p><p>"That's  good," Kasumi noted. She hoped that her sister would not have too many  problems going back to school. There were going to be some, but she knew Akane  could handle it.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Nabiki  sighed; she watched the brood of demons enter the house and walk upstairs. At  least Akane was able to practice martial arts with... her mother. The middle  sister had an idea as to what they were training for. They <i>were</i> working with Willard International Consulting, an organization  she only recently learned the truth about.</p><p>The  brunette mentally kicked herself for not seeing it earlier. Kasumi's coworkers  were a bunch of company drones with no lives outside of their work. Nabiki had  just assumed that their work was white-collar, not black helicopter.</p><p>"Nabiki,"  a familiar voice behind the teenager stated. Nabiki's body jerked in surprise  as she turned to see Kasumi standing behind her.</p><p>"You're  going to be asked questions tomorrow. I trust you'll not divulge anything  sensitive?" the operations agent inquired in a friendly voice. A slight  smile was on her face.</p><p>"No.  Akane's my sister too," Nabiki said, somewhat insulted by the comment. She  then looked into her sister's eyes. She always knew something was... off with  Kasumi. Her older sister's incident of five years ago was still fresh in her  mind.</p><p>"Good,"  Kasumi said with a grin that was much less threatening.</p><p>"It's  just so very strange. Sure it's still Akane, but she's not human."</p><p>"Akane's  gotten much better," Kasumi noted. "Ranma seems to be doing a good  job."</p><p>"For a  sex demon sure."</p><p>"That's  what Akane is now."</p><p>Nabiki did not  know how to interpret her sister's tone.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Okay,  it's my turn," Ranma said as Akane stepped out of the shower.</p><p>"You're  not going to use any hot water, are you Mommy?" Nariko asked while she  handed her mate a towel.</p><p>"Yeah,"  the redhead said.</p><p>"Mommy..."  Nariko whined.</p><p>"Are  you sure you want to, Mother?"</p><p>Recognizing  the girl's shock, Ranma sighed. "I'm sorry, but I'm going to take a hot  shower. Look, I'll be right here. You'll even be able to see me through the  glass."</p><p>"If  you insist," Akane acquiesced. She then hung up her towel. "Don't  worry, Mommy's still here," she reassured her mate.</p><p>Nariko  nodded and took comfort in Akane's embrace.</p><p>"Yes,  I'm not leaving," Ranma said to the pair of nude demons. The redhead  closed her eyes. and her unitard and undergarments disappeared. The demoness  walked into the shower stall. Using the hot water that came out of the faucet,  she changed forms as her male clothes appeared</p><p>Ranma  stepped back to avoid the water and disrobed. His clothing was then tossed over  the shower curtain. He knew his children were still in the bathroom, but he  could not feel them. Ranma put those thoughts aside concentrated on washing his  body. If the girls needed him it would be quite easy to bring <i>Mommy</i> back.</p><p>After he  finished showering he shut off the water and asked for a towel. Ranma expected  one of his girls to toss one to him. Instead, Nariko slid open the door and  handed him a towel.</p><p>Ranma  blinked at his daughter. He should have seen this coming. Grabbing the towel he  quickly wrapped it around his waist.</p><p>"Something  wrong Mommy?" Nariko asked, with some confusion. How could she have a  problem with nudity? The brood slept in the nude and only wore clothing for  convenience.</p><p>"Oh,  nothing" Ranma forced himself to either avert his gaze or keep it centered  on his girl's face.</p><p>"Mommy's  bashful." Nariko smiled to her mate.</p><p>"Don't  see why, Mother's very good looking in either form," Akane noted. The  blue-haired demon looked over the human form of her mother and formulated a  plan. Mother had sacrificed so much for them. It would be nice if she could  show her appreciation.</p><p>"It's  just that I'm male, like this and you're... Never mind." Ranma walked to  the sink. He was actually pretty happy. The girls were joking about his male  form and not cowering and whining for their Mommy. That was a good sign.</p><p>"You're  going to change back, aren't you?" Nariko asked.</p><p>"In a  little bit." He inspected his eyes; they seemed to be clear of violet  flecks. He sighed in relief before placing his hand into a flow of cold water  from the faucet. The martial artist watched the reflected pair of eyes subtly  change shape and not so subtly change color.</p><p>Ranma  looked her body over. She was planning to summon her unitard and wear that, or  go to her room and get the leather dress her mother had bought her. Her growing  powers <i>had</i> given her more options.  Ranma shrugged and decided to see what she could do.</p><p>The black  calf-high, high-heeled, leather boots were the same, but everything else was  different. She wore a pair of black leather pants that were not <i>quite</i> painted on. Her top was sleeveless  and silk. Of a Chinese style, it bore considerable resemblance to the top of a  cheongsam. The shirt was dark green and clasped with buttons in the front and  had gold trim.</p><p>"Wow,  you look great," Akane said, looking her Mother over.</p><p>"It's  very nice," Nariko confirmed.</p><p>Ranma's  reaction was a bit different. "I'm finally wearing pants!"</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Assembly of  Man acolyte Ryoga Hibiki leveled his gaze at his partner. The two demon hunters  were in the hotel room that they had been using.</p><p>"I  assure you, I have no doubts." Ukyou gazed out the window of the room. The  Canada Trust Tower loomed prominently in the view. She pushed those errant,  those traitorous thoughts out of her mind; now was not the time.</p><p>"Really?  Father Oslo has told me about your previous relation with the target."</p><p>"I  didn't know the demon was Ranma!" Ukyou shouted. "<i>You</i> knew who this demon was, but you  never told me! And you've had just as much personal contact with Ranma as  me."</p><p>"I had  my orders," Ryoga said simply.</p><p>"It's  moot, anyway. Even <i>if</i> Ranma was my  friend, that's not him, not anymore. That's a demon that took over and  corrupted his body. There's no way I could confuse Ranma Saotome with that  redheaded succubus."</p><p>"Just  be sure to keep that in mind."</p><p>"I  will... though, maybe we should ask for assistance."</p><p>"No.  We don't need any help," Ryoga indignantly replied.</p><p>"Are  you sure? You couldn't kill her before, and now she's got two spawn."</p><p>"I  tried to do that alone before, but together we will destroy them."</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Umm,  Red, I really don't need to see your butt in that much detail," Nabiki  remarked dryly to Ranma as the brood mother walked into the kitchen.</p><p>"Hey!  You're the one staring at me." Ranma turned to face the teenager.</p><p>"It's  hard not to," Nabiki replied. "You're wearing skin-tight leather  pants."</p><p>"They're  pants. At the moment, that's <i>all</i> that  matters. So shut up," Ranma paused to pull some material off her skin.  "Besides, these aren't that tight."</p><p>"A  whole quarter inch of extra material. No, not tight at all," Nabiki  observed, dryly.</p><p>"Actually,  Mother's clothing's pretty modest," Akane interjected as she and her mate  walked in from the porch.</p><p>"Well,  she <i>is</i> wearing clothing," Nabiki  remarked.</p><p>"I was  only naked in the living room <i>once</i>!"  Akane bristled. In practice for school she kept control of herself and  prevented her eyes from flaring.</p><p>The middle  sister decided to not comment about the other places Akane was naked, and  instead comment on something else. "At least the school uniform looks good  with your new hair. I'm surprised you're wearing the normal version and not the  fashion disaster that your mother does."</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>"Please  tell me you're not going to defend that... thing you wear," Nabiki smiled.</p><p>"Well...  no," Ranma said before changing the subject. "So Akane, what were you  doing out there?"</p><p>"We were  talking with Father and Grandpa about if we'd qualify for the joining of the  houses," Akane explained.</p><p>"Oh,  any luck with that?" Ranma asked as she looked out to see her father and  Soun sitting out on the back porch playing what looked to be go, but might have  been something else.</p><p>"Grandpa's  strange. I don't know what he thinks of me," Nariko commented.</p><p>"I'm  sure he likes you. He's just... set in his ways," Ranma suggested. She  hoped she would not have to straighten things out with her father... again.</p><p>"We  should get to school pretty soon," Nabiki remarked. "So Sunshine, not  even going to bother with a mockery of the uniform?" the teenager asked,  using Ranma's school alias.</p><p>Ranma  glared at Nabiki and used her powers to change her clothing.</p><p>"No fishnets?  And is that skirt just a miniskirt instead of a micro-mini?" Nabiki  inquired in a teasing voice. Ranma's uniform was still darker than the normal,  most notably in the use of a black blouse instead of a white one and a crimson  girl's ribbon tie instead of a dark blue one, but her skirt was normal length.  Ranma's kids were wearing their own standard uniforms.</p><p>"You  think I <i>like</i> wearing that stuff? I'm  a guy," Ranma replied.</p><p>Nabiki  raised her eyebrow and snickered.</p><p>"Let's  just go," the redhead grumbled</p><p>The middle  Tendo sister's response was cut short. Something was off. She normally had to  look up to meet the redhead's eyes, but now... "Just how high were those  platform boots?" Nabiki asked after checking Ranma's footwear.</p><p>"Those  things are a pain to wear," Ranma said with a shrug.</p><p>"But  you look so delightfully Goth in them," Nabiki teased. She smiled after  seeing Ranma glare.</p><p>Nariko  looked at her mommy. Barefoot, she might actually be a bit taller than the  redheaded demon that had turned her. Nariko paused at that. She should <i>not </i>be taller than Mommy. Tatewaki was  taller than Ranma. Nariko shook her head. It did not really matter.</p><p>The quartet  made their way out of the house and to Nabiki's car. Their progress was noted  by the WIC team that was watching the house. The surveillance had been quietly  added after Akane had been taken.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"It's  been fairly quiet," Janet remarked to her companions as they walked down  the second floor hallway.</p><p>"What  are you talking about?" Usagi asked "Everyone's been talking about  Akane today."</p><p>"More  demons," Rei muttered as she shook her head. There was a time when they  would attack beings like that on sight.</p><p>"Not  that, with our... after school activities," Janet clarified. "So far  I've just had that thing with Ami in that store."</p><p>"You  seem... eager," Usagi stated as the group walked down a stairwell.</p><p>"Well,  I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop. I can't help but sense that  something big is coming."</p><p>"The  school did get taken over," Rei reminded the newest Senshi.</p><p>"Where  is Ami, anyway?" Usagi asked.</p><p>"Yeah, it's not often we see you two  apart," Rei joked. She did feel a bit perturbed at how much time Ami spent  with the new girl, but she could see the reasons for it. Janet was smart and a  Senshi. Granted, the auburn-haired girl was not a super-genius like Ami was,  but Janet was very bright.</p><p>"She  told me she wanted to find Minako and Makoto," Janet explained, answering  Usagi's question.</p><p>"Oh, I  see," Usagi said.</p><p>"So what  do you guys think of Sunshine's brood?" Janet quietly asked.</p><p>"They  seem nice enough," Usagi's gaze was distant.</p><p>"Yeah,  for a bunch of... demons. They seem okay," Rei admitted after they exited  the stairwell and entered the ground floor.</p><p>"I'm  glad we got your approval," a voice calmly remarked.</p><p>Rei turned  to see a redhead with violet-flecked  blue-eyes leaning on some lockers. "What're you doing here?" the  raven-haired girl asked.</p><p>"Akane  and Nariko are in the bathroom," Ranma explained as she pointed to the  door. While she had no problems with going into a girl's bathroom when she  needed to use it, going in when she did not was different.</p><p>"Oh,  so how's your... family doing?" Usagi asked after considering her words.  The school's general population did not know about the brood.</p><p>"The  girls are fine," Ranma replied, eyeing the other Senshi. "I guess  someone told you about them. That's good. Now you won't do anything  stupid."</p><p>Rei  bristled at the unspoken threat, but the princess had declared these demons off  limits.</p><p>"Wow,  I've never been this close to a- well you know- before," Janet remarked as  she looked over Ranma. The redhead looked human; though there was something off  about her. It was mostly with the eyes, while there was nothing that looked inhuman  about them, they were simply a little bit... strange, though it could just be  their blue and violet coloration.</p><p>"Yeah."  Ranma turned to see her daughters exiting the bathroom. The mother smiled  slightly at the sight.</p><p>Akane  stopped when she spotted the girls mother was talking to. She could <i>smell</i> a signature on the humans,  something that Mother had as well. "Sunny?" the blue-haired girl  asked, using the public name for Mother her mate had come up with.</p><p>"It's  okay, Akane. They're those girls we talked about," Ranma reassured.</p><p>"Hi!  I'm Nariko Saotome," the black and violet-haired demoness greeted happily  as she walked closer to Usagi.</p><p>"Usagi  Tsukino," Usagi smiled in return. The red-eyed demoness seemed to be very  nice.</p><p>"Nari-chan..."  Ranma warned.</p><p>"But  my records still say my last name's Kuno," Nariko admitted, sheepishly.</p><p>"Maybe  we should eat lunch together," Usagi suggested. "We should get to  know each other more."</p><p>"We  were planning on eating with Samantha and Naoko," Ranma said as the group  of girls made their way to the cafeteria.</p><p>"They're  not cleared?" Janet asked. Neither of those girls were Sailor Senshi or  demons, but they might be agents.</p><p>"They're  nice <i>normal</i> girls," Ranma  explained, answering the girl's question. It was nice to have some friends who  were not too weird. The downside was that they were Sunshine Saotome's friends.</p><p>"Hey  Akane, I like the new hair. You wanna have a good time?" a male classmate  by the name of William Stetson said while leering at the girl. He was fairly  handsome, but obnoxious.</p><p>A small  growl escaped Akane's lips as she turned to face the intruder. Getting hit on  like this was starting to wear very thin, and right in front of her mate!  "I'm not interested in you. I've got a girlfriend now. Just leave,"  the demon said managing to keep her voice even and her eyes from glowing. Part  of her wanted to give Stetson exactly what he wanted, right up until she  drained the last drop of life force out of his body.</p><p>"Well  maybe you could both come. I'm sure I could handle you two," Stetson said  with a slanted smile.</p><p>Ranma  smirked. The poor fool had <i>no</i> idea  what he was dealing with. She did know exactly what Akane was going though.  Most guys took the hint and stopped bugging her, but there were always a few  who kept coming back.</p><p>It was as  if they were drawn to her and her kids, which was quite true. Succubae were  designed to be very sexy, sensual, and appealing. When they got around hormonal  teenage boys...</p><p>It would be  simplicity itself to seduce one and drain him. Ranma shook her head. She would <i>never</i> do that. Not to a boy or a girl.  It was just an urge she had. She could almost taste the energy the humans gave  off. Her kids seemed to have even less of a problem with it. They did have each  other and they were still draining energy from their mother. Though ever since  she had killed those youma, Ranma had found those urges had been dulled.</p><p>Nariko bit her lower lip. She remembered  Stetson. He was one of Tatewaki's friends and seemed like a nice enough guy  back then. Now, he was a rude annoyance. Nariko sighed; things were so  confusing.</p><p>"No,"  Akane said as she narrowed her eyes. "Remember what happened the last time  you hit on me?"</p><p>"You  hit right back," Stetson replied, thinking he sounded much cooler than he  really did.</p><p>"Well  Nariko, it looks like he finally got one right," Akane almost snarled as  she made a fist. She would have preferred to extend her claws.</p><p>Stetson  ignored the fist and looked in eyes that <i>almost</i>  seemed to glow. The teen suddenly felt an overwhelming fear for his safely. A  deep primal part of him got the urge to flee and hide. He was lucky that Akane  had chosen that sense to give off. She could just as easily given another  signal, one that would have ensnared him.</p><p>"Bill.  Go. Now," Akane stated.</p><p>Stetson  looked at the six girls glaring at him. The three paler ones seemed more  threatening, not that the other half was friendly either. After giving one  last, quite lame pickup line, he quietly slinked away.</p><p>"Wow,  no wonder you guys changed teams," Janet observed once Stetson was out of  sight.</p><p>Rei gave a  sideways glance at the auburn-haired girl, but held her tongue.</p><p>"You  did good, Akane," Ranma reassured.</p><p>"Why  can't they leave us alone?" Akane moaned.</p><p>"I'm  sorry," Nariko said as she looked down at the hem of her skirt.</p><p>"Don't  worry. These guys would be after us anyway without what you... what Tatewaki  did," Akane said as she wrapped her arm around her mate's waist.</p><p>"No,  I'm sorry about what I did to you and Mommy," Nariko clarified.</p><p>"I  can't forgive what Tatewaki did. He was a vile person."</p><p>Nariko  whimpered and closed her eyes.</p><p>Akane  pulled her mate closer. "But you're not him. You're Nariko."</p><p>"I  know; I still feel bad."</p><p>"That's  what makes you a good person."</p><p>A mental  image flashed into Usagi's mind as she watched the two demons comfort each  other. It was from the dream she had, the one where she and Queen DarkStar  ruled over humanity. The blonde shuddered, not wanting to think of mated  succubae, especially when one of them was herself.</p><p>Usagi looked  at Ranma. There was something she to know - there was also something Usagi  should tell her. "Sunshine," Usagi said, using Ranma's alias.  "Can we talk... in private?" the blonde asked, her eyes looking at  the redhead.</p><p>"I guess so," Ranma  agreed. "Girls, get your lunch. I'll be with you in a bit," the  demoness said to her kids.</p><p>"You two go with Akane and  Nariko, we'll be right back," Usagi told Rei and Janet.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Queen DarkStar?" Ranma  asked after Usagi had explained that dream. "That's pretty messed up. I'm  not royalty, and I've got no intention to take over the world," the  redhead said. A small voice within her did tell her that the original DarkStar  was a queen and did control the earth. This voice was quashed by another one  that claimed that she <i>only</i> had the  body, memories, and powers of DarkStar.</p><p>"The dream predicted  Nariko," Usagi pointed out as the walked along one of the paths outside  the school. The two girls were speaking in Japanese. It was a welcome change  for Usagi who while understandable, did not enjoy English.</p><p>Ranma had been raised to be fluent  in two languages and hardly cared. When Genma learned of Soun's plans to move  to Canada, he knew that it would be best for the joining of the houses if any  children he had could speak English.</p><p>The redhead suspected that Usagi  also switched languages to prevent eavesdropping. Ranma smirked a little bit at  that. WIC had an Operations Centre in Japan and Furinkan was full of Japanese  students. "But it didn't have Akane. I guess those other girls were  Samantha and Naoko," Ranma said.</p><p>"Still..."</p><p>"So you knew the name of my  daughter beforehand. That's the ONE thing your dream had that's real. I'm  pretty sure we're not going to date. You're nice and all, but I've got more pressing  things in my life. And didn't you lose your boyfriend?" Ranma asked after  she looked Usagi over.</p><p>Usagi blinked. Most nights she still  cried before falling asleep. It hurt to have lost him and in such a senseless  way. He had died before, but at least those times it was in her arms... and of  course he came back. She still hoped for a resurrection, but it seemed pretty  grim. She was talking to Mamoru's... replacement.</p><p>"Though the part about you  being a demon is... interesting," Ranma said as she appraised the girl.  The redhead could easily see how the blonde would look as a succubus. It was an  image that would haunt her own dreams later.</p><p>"It was horrible," Usagi  said, shuddering at the memory. She looked to see Ranma's eyes appear to  shimmer slightly.</p><p>"I can imagine," Ranma  noted. She idly licked one of her fangs. It would be simple to... The redhead  halted that line of thought.</p><p>The blonde stared at the demoness.  "I know that dream's not real. It's still troubling. Why did it get that  Nariko part right? Have you been having any odd dreams?"</p><p>"I'm a guy who's also a demonic  mother. Yeah, I get them a lot."</p><p>"I still don't like knowing  Nariko's name."</p><p>"Neither do I. You sure no one  told you about Nariko before you met her?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"I don't think so..."  Usagi said as she pondered.</p><p>"The dream also has me treating  those demons like minions and not kids," Ranma observed.</p><p>"So you really are a  mother?" Usagi asked.</p><p>"Uh, yeah," Ranma  confirmed as she looked around the school grounds. While she could not see the  WIC team that was monitoring them, she knew one had to be there. "There's  two ways to I can turn someone into a demon. One, I force the person to change  and they turn into a demon that's bonded to me."</p><p>"A minion?"</p><p>"A child," Ranma corrected.  The thought of having mere minions instead of children sickened her. Monsters  like Alexia had minions. "The other's more complicated and needs the help  of the person being turned, but the new demon isn't nearly as dependent on  me."</p><p>"Why didn't you use that  one?" Usagi asked. The possibility that Ranma wanted to have a brood  entered the blonde's mind.</p><p>"The second way's too slow.  Both of my kids were dying when I turned them. I had to make them into my  children."</p><p>"I'm a mother too," Usagi  admitted. "Or I will be."</p><p>"What?" Ranma asked. That  had gotten her attention.</p><p>"My daughter's from the future.  I have her with Mamoru. She was sent back in time for her safety. Good thing...  I don't think the future's like I remember it anymore," Usagi sighed. She  still believed in Crystal Tokyo, but with Mamoru gone things were going to be  different.</p><p>"Future? Yeah... with that –um  Black Moon group, right? So you know what's going to happen?" Ranma asked.  Murdock had told him about the Senshi, but a lot of what he said seemed too  far-fetched.</p><p>"We did," Usagi sighed as  she rubbed her eyes. "But Murdock ruined that." Usagi's face twisted  in anger.</p><p>"Oh," the redhead stated  as she let the Murdock comment slide "So in that <i>future</i> with your <i>late</i>  boyfriend you had a kid. She came back in time; she's here right now?" the  demoness asked as she tried to untangle the blonde's story.</p><p>"Setsuna got a sample from him.  He can still be her father," Usagi explained.</p><p>Ranma nodded with understanding.  "So then she knew he was going to die?"</p><p>"Not quite," Usagi  answered, glaring at the demon. "Before... before he died, there was this  evil queen. Long story short, she did something to Mamoru that made our  daughter start to fade in and out of existence. After we beat her, Setsuna did  that to make sure my daughter wouldn't disappear again."</p><p>"Good thing then," Ranma  agreed. The thought of losing one of her kids made the demoness shudder.  "You have a photo of her?" Ranma asked, suspecting the answer to that  question. After all, she had pictures of her kids in her purse and her male  form's wallet, and her mother carried much the same.</p><p>"Yes, here's my  Chibi-Usa," Usagi answered as she pulled out and handed over the image.  The blonde smiled; at least one part of Mamoru was still alive.</p><p>"Cute," Ranma said,  looking over the picture. The pink hair was a bit much, but the eyes were very  interesting.</p><p>"A little bit too cute,"  Usagi said.</p><p>"She reminds me of my  Nari-chan. Same eye color," Ranma explained.</p><p>"I wouldn't be surprised if she  was a demon all this time," Usagi joked.</p><p>Ranma noted that there was something  strange in the blonde's tone, but shrugged it off. "She staying with you  and the other Senshi?"</p><p>"Sorta. She's back in Japan  with the outers."</p><p>"Why?" Ranma asked. She  suspected that there were Senshi to the other planets. Pluto was proof of this.</p><p>"The outers are there in case  something happens in Japan."</p><p>"And your daughter's with them  because...?" Ranma asked. The thought of being on the other side of the  world from her children was completely alien to her.</p><p>"Pluto advised it," Usagi  sighed. "It's... it's... going to be dangerous to have her here. She's  just a kid."</p><p>The demon blinked. She was training  her kids to fight and had already lead them into battle. However, Usagi's  daughter was much younger. "I just think you should have your daughter  brought over here. She did lose her father. She'd want to be with her mother  again, and you do have your friends to help protect her."</p><p>"When I talk to Usa next I'll  ask her if she wants to visit."</p><p>"Okay, I know it's strange to  get parenting advice from an energy-draining male demoness," Ranma  laughed.</p><p>"You... drain people?"  Usagi asked. She should have known. Ranma was a demon. Suddenly, the blonde  wished she was not alone with her.</p><p>"Nope, only the demons we've  fought," the succubus said. Though a part of her wondered what she would  do if she killed a human opponent... like Assemblyman Hibiki. Then there were  the boys, and even girls, at school... Ranma immediately terminated that line  of thought.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Ranma leveled her gaze at the other  magical girl "It's something we need. Well... I don't need it as much, but  my kids are growing. It's a good way to do it. The energy would go to waste  anyway."</p><p>"I guess it's better than  seducing and draining people," Usagi allowed.</p><p>"Neither myself or my kids will  EVER do that," Ranma evenly said, but her eyes did start to glow.</p><p>"Sorry," Usagi apologized,  slightly unnerved by Ranma's outburst. "It's just strange. You feed on  demons. They were your own kind-"</p><p>Ranma glared at this.</p><p>"-and you took their energy.  It's kinda like cannibalism."</p><p>"Kinda," Ranma agreed,  deciding not to mention what Akane had done; that <i>was</i> cannibalism. "Look, it's not something I'm proud of,"  the redhead started. <i>Don't kid yourself;  you are proud,</i> Ranma mentally corrected herself. <i>Remember how you felt when your kids made their first kills? That  feeling of satisfaction and pride. </i></p><p>"It's just something we have to  do," Ranma shrugged. "These monsters have to be killed."</p><p>"I guess. It's just creepy...  no offense."</p><p>"How do you think it feels from  my side? You think I want to be a demon?" Ranma asked in a quiet but  forceful voice.</p><p>Usagi made eye contact; blue eyes  met with violet-tainted ones. "No, but you have to be one anyway,"  the blonde answered.</p><p>"Yes," replied Ranma, her  eyes guarded.</p><p>"Let's go see how the girls are  doing."</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Alexia  watched the house across the street from her location. Getting herself in position  had been the easy part; controlling her power so that she would not be detected  was much harder.</p><p>The  demoness smirked despite this. Her minions, those that were still alive, had  tried to suggest that it would not be in her best interest to go herself. If  those humans found her they <i>might</i>-  Alexia shut of that line of reasoning. Her mortality was not something she  liked to dwell on.</p><p><i>Besides,</i> the demoness thought with a  smirk as she turned her attention to the WIC van parked near the house. They're  on the lookout for something demonic. <i>They're  expecting a brood of demons to swoop in and start killing, not carefully  observing and plotting.</i></p><p>Sneaking  to that gray van and slaughtering the humans inside had a definite appeal to  Alexia, but she knew it would simply increase their presence around the house.  The demoness sighed. Her brood <i>could</i>  storm the house, but the response from the humans would be swift. The chances  of her minions slaying the treasonous brood were, sadly, slim.</p><p>The  problem was in those... agents. Their equipment provided an effective early  warning system. Her spawn could easily get past it, but not without alerting  them. The same was true of the school the traitor and her stolen minions still  attended for some reason. Alexia preferred to ignore the little detail that  only one of Ranma's children had been turned by herself.</p><p>She  then spotted a silver sedan approach and park in front of the house. Alexia's  face clouded as she watched her spawn step out. The young demoness, now  enslaved to and altered by that traitorous bitch, was happily chatting with a  demon hunter. As she watched this... abomination, she was struck with  inspiration. There <i>was</i> a way she  could strike at that annoying redhead and reclaim what was hers...</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Oh  hi, Akane. How's it going?" Ranma asked as her daughter entered their  bedroom. Nariko was spending a few hours with her father, and Akane had just  been out with Kasumi.</p><p>"When...  when I first met you... I saw that little leather dress and thought you were  just another bimbo," Akane admitted as she sat down on the bed next to her  mother. "I'd never thought I'd end up in leathers of my own," the  demoness sighed.</p><p>"It's  not like you wear them all the time... anymore," Ranma offered.</p><p>"I  know," Akane smiled as she picked the gift that Kasumi had helped her pick  up.</p><p>"What's  this?" Ranma asked as she looked at the simply wrapped box her daughter  had handed her.</p><p>"Open  it," Akane offered.</p><p>The redhead  ripped the wrapping off and gazed at the contents. <i>Great, more clothes</i>, she thought. She then looked closer at the two  items. It was clothing, but it was not for her succubus form. Holding the shirt  and drawstring pants, Ranma looked questioningly at Akane.</p><p>"You  were there for me, you helped me remember who I was and accept what I am. I  want to be there for you too," Akane explained.</p><p>"But  this?"</p><p>"I  know you're really... really a guy. I've seen how you look at your  male-side," Akane said, somewhat softly. "It's gotta hurt to do this  - be a woman, a demoness, a mother. But you do it anyway, for us." She  then flashed a fanged grin that went straight to the young mother's heart.</p><p>The redhead  closed her eyes and smiled.</p><p>"Mother,  are you okay?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I'm  fine," Ranma said as she wiped the corners of her eyes. There was still  hope for her human side. "I'm just so proud. I love you so much." The  demoness then leaned over and hugged Akane.</p><p>"I  love you too," Akane sighed happily in her mother's embrace.</p><p>Ranma  untangled herself from her daughter. "I think I'll go change."</p><p>"I  checked the size of your clothing before I went. It should fit you," Akane  offered.</p><p>"Thanks  Honey," the redhead said as she walked out of the room.</p><p>As her  mother left, Akane chuckled at Ranma's modesty. But that helped prove that her mother  really was a guy, at least when she was male.</p><p>Once in the  bathroom, Ranma returned to her birth form. He did not worry about Nariko  losing her connection to Mommy. His daughter was already out of range. Ranma  then changed into Akane's gift. Ranma chuckled as he pulled on the pair of  black pants. Akane had gotten the right size and Ranma would not need to worry  about asking her to return it. The martial artist then slipped on the rich  yellow, almost golden, silk shirt.</p><p>Ranma  looked at his reflection with a sideways smirk. <i>He</i> still had a chance to exist, in spite of- or maybe because of  his daughters. He then walked back to his room.</p><p>"You  look good," Akane said as she looked over Ranma. Part of Akane preferred  her mother to be in demon form, but if this would make Mother happy...</p><p>"Thanks,  Akane. You sure you're okay with me being like this?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"For a  while," Akane admitted. While she could accept, and encourage Mother to be  human sometimes, she still needed her <i>mother</i>.  Akane wondered if her mate would be able to understand. "I know this  coffee shop nearby. It's not a long walk," Akane suggested.</p><p>"Hmmm,  I guess." While Ranma was not a big fan of coffee, it would be nice to  spend some time as a male with his daughter. Ranma and Akane walked down to the  first floor and out the front door. Ranma looked questioningly at the overcast  sky. He was starting to see that cloud cover was the norm in this part of the  world, at least in fall. The martial artist shrugged. If it rained then he and  Akane could fly back or catch a ride with the WIC team that was likely to  follow them.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Ami  Mizuno's journey was not hampered by the threat of rain. Her and her friend's  destination was in the building. The apartment door was quickly answered by a  professional-looking woman with auburn colored hair. "Hi, Dr.  Fraiser," the blue-haired girl greeted. "Is Janet in?"</p><p>"Hi,"  Usagi greeted from her spot next to Ami. She idly wondered if all smart girls  had doctors for mothers.</p><p>"Yes,  she's in her room," Nadine Fraiser said as she opened the door. Her shift  at North York General Hospital had just ended.</p><p>"Thanks,"  Ami replied as she crossed the threshold.</p><p>"It's  nice to see Janet's making friends," Nadine said as she closed the door.</p><p>"Yeah,"  Ami agreed. Why did Janet's mother seem surprised that her daughter was making  friends? Janet seemed nice and outgoing enough. <i>Maybe I just think that because she's less shy than I am, </i>Ami  thought morosely.<i> All my friends </i>are<i> Senshi, even my new one.</i></p><p>"Janet's  in her room." Nadine pointed to the location of her daughter's room.</p><p>"Thanks,  Dr. Fraiser," Usagi said as she followed Ami. The blonde noticed that Ami  went to Janet's room before the older woman told her where it was. Usagi  ignored this; she assumed that this was not the first time Ami had visited.</p><p>In this  Usagi was entirely correct.</p><p>Ami knocked  on the door. "Janet, It's me and Usagi."</p><p>Shortly  after the music playing in Janet's room lowered in volume, the auburn-haired  girl opened the door. "Hey, guys. Glad you could make it. I'll show you my  room," Janet said while giving a sly smile to Ami.</p><p>Ami sighed  and shook her head.</p><p>Except for  a pile of papers and open books on her desk, Janet's room was immaculate. The  level of organization was something that even Ami found excessive. Janet was  showing off her bookcase when Usagi noticed something.</p><p>Usagi  looked over Janet. "You know, if you put on a lab-coat, you'd be pretty  close to your mom."</p><p>Janet's  face darkened. "No, I'm not."</p><p>"But  your noses are very close. Your faces have the same shape."</p><p>"Your  eyes are almost the same shade of grayish-green," Ami added.</p><p>"It's  a coincidence." Janet had sat on her bed and looked past her friends.</p><p>"Pardon?"  Ami asked.</p><p>Janet paused.  She did not want to keep secrets from her friends. She was going to trust them  with her life. "I'm adopted," the Senshi of Orion admitted. "My  birth mother... she... she died."</p><p>"I'm  sorry," Ami said as she hugged Janet. At least this explained how Janet  got the last name Fraiser. Ami did wonder what had happened to Janet's birth  father but thought it wise not to ask.</p><p>"It's  okay," Janet said in a distant voice. "It... was years ago."</p><p>"You  poor girl," Usagi said as she sat down next to Janet.</p><p>"I'll  be fine," Janet said flatly.</p><p>"You're  not alone," Usagi gave Janet a supportive hand squeeze. Janet did have  another mother now, unlike Makoto who was still an orphan as was... Mamoru.</p><p>"I  know," Janet stated with a slight smile.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"What'd you think of your  first day of school?" Ranma asked as he stirred his hot chocolate. He did  not like coffee and the tea the cafe served was awful.</p><p>"Could have been worse."  Akane looked out one of the windows and sighed. "I kinda wanted there to  be more of an uproar. I mean, I come back from being missing and more people  comment more about my dye job than they do about me being a lesbian!"</p><p>Ranma turned to see what the  demoness was looking at but remained silent. A silver car had pulled up onto  the opposite side of the street.</p><p>"I  guess those rumors about me playing for the other team were good after  all." The blue-haired girl noted sourly. "Half the school probably  was expecting me to get a girlfriend. I am Akane Tendo-" She glanced at  her mother. "Well Saotome, but they don't know that- boy hater."</p><p>Akane  continued. "I guess it's not so bad. Nariko's much nicer than any  boy."</p><p>"She  is a good kid," Ranma stated hesitantly.</p><p>"It's  not your fault," Akane said, trying to stop what she knew was going to  happen.</p><p>"It  is. I'm guilty as hell. If I'd mothered Nariko from day one, she'd..."  Ranma sighed.</p><p>"You're  her mother now, and that is helping her. Nariko used to be incapable of  disagreeing with you, but now. 'No, Mommy, I think the pink skirt is better,'  " Akane quoted from an earlier conversation.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Nari-chan is  spending all day after school with her father. It's good that you both have  dads." He glanced out the window to see that what was clearly a Company  car had left.</p><p>"Yeah, you're not a single  mom," Akane said, her voice quite flat.</p><p>"What's wrong Honey?"</p><p>"Oh nothing," Akane  sighed. She hated Tatewaki, but she loved Nariko. She was depressed at the near  certainty that Nariko will never "fully recover," but she was  relieved that her mate would never turn  back into what she was. The demoness hated taking comfort in that.</p><p>"It's about Nariko."</p><p>Akane nodded. "After she tried  to apologize to me. I asked her what she felt about her human life, her old  life." She looked at her own drink. She took a reluctant sip of the  caffeinated beverage.</p><p>"What'd she say?"</p><p>"Not much. I don't know  whether she simply doesn't think much about it or if she's keeping it  private."</p><p>Ranma  blinked. Nariko was the most open person he knew. This was something he had to  keep his eye on.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"What  do you think I should do, Daddy?" Nariko asked. The demoness and her  father were sitting in the expansive kitchen of the Kuno house.</p><p>"You  haven't asked your... mother?" the Drake inquired.</p><p>"You've  known me longer," Nariko said, nervously.</p><p>The Drake  smiled. That his child still cared for him, still confided in him reassured him  greatly. "I think I've got a solution," the Drake said before  explaining what his daughter could do.</p><p>"Oh  Daddy! You're so smart!" Nariko leapt over and hugged her father.</p><p>The Drake  closed his arms around his daughter, who snuggled in. The Drake's resolve  strengthened. His son Tatewaki might be gone, but his daughter Nariko still had  a chance.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>A pair of  teenagers walked down the edge of the road. The female was leaning on the male  who had his arm around her. Ranma looked at his daughter who had a strange grin  on her face.</p><p>"What?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh,  it's just the waitress at the coffee shop thought we were a couple," Akane  laughed.</p><p>"You  did keep pretty close to me," Ranma said as he loosened his grip on  Akane's waist.</p><p>"You're  my mother. Though I guess there was no way they could know that."</p><p>"They  saw a guy and a girl, same age," Ranma agreed with a sigh. A  misunderstanding like that had been central to what had happened to Nariko.  Ranma, and the former Kuno boy, had both thought that it was romantic love  instead of parental.</p><p>"I did  have a cutesy nickname for you too," Akane laughed.</p><p>"Yeah,"  Ranma sighed. It could have been worse. At least it was only Akane and Nariko  who called him Sunny. He did not like the name much, but Nariko had picked it  and he did not want to hurt her feelings. He then heard the familiar sound of  sporadic rain hitting the ground, leaves, pavement, and everything else.</p><p>He looked  up to see no discernable change in the heavy cloud cover, aside from the  precipitation. Soon there was enough water to trigger the transformation.</p><p>Akane  nearly purred at the return of her bond with her mother. As nice as Mother's  male form was, it was nothing compared to her true form. Akane paused. <i>No, Mother's human form is her true one.  It's the one she was born with.</i></p><p>"Damn  lake effect weather," Ranma grumbled as she pulled her now-loose, longer  and crimson hair, back. She looked at her soaked daughter. "Follow  me," she said before walking into the forest that ran on the right side of  the road.</p><p>Once they  were surrounded by trees, Ranma did a quick scan with her senses. She then  shifted her silk shirt and leather pants slightly. Her true form then  manifested. After stretching her wings and tail, Ranma turned to her daughter.  "Come on, we're going to do some flying."</p><p>Akane  looked around the forest. The largely deciduous trees were not that close, but  it would still be tricky to use her full wingspan. The constant downpour did  not help either. "Mother, you sure about this?"</p><p>"It's  good training," Ranma said as she oriented herself in the direction of  home. "Not all of our flying will be in open spaces and with clear weather."</p><p>Akane  nodded at this and reverted to her full-demon form. "I'm ready," she  said after a brief stretch. Keeping her tail and especially her wings hidden,  while easy, always left them a little bit stiff.</p><p>"I'll  follow you. That way if you hit anything, I'll see it," Ranma said as she  spread her wings.<br/>Akane extended her  light-cobalt wings and took to the air. It was hard to weave her way through  the trees. She had to go fast enough to stay in the air but slow enough to  avoid trunks and branches. The ends of some of the latter scratched against her  wing membranes.</p><p>When they  were about halfway home, the blue-haired demoness took a turn too sharply and a  branch went right through her left wing. It tore several inches of her wing  membrane, until the twig hit one of her wing supports and broke off.</p><p>Yowling in  pain, Akane tumbled but managed to land on her feet. She almost slipped on the  muddy ground, but her tail helped keep her balance. With a wince, Akane pulled her  wing in front of her to get a look at the damage.</p><p>The  demoness looked up from examining the gash to see her mother land. Akane sighed  - Mother was always so graceful. She never had problems flying and her posture  was always perfect, even here in the pouring rain. "It doesn't look too  bad," Akane said as her mother examined the wounded wing.</p><p>"It  should be okay," Ranma said after watching the torn membranes begin to  knit back together. She also checked to make sure there were no splinters or  other debris in the wound. "How's the pain?" the redhead asked as she  held her hand over the wound. Their wings were nowhere near as sensitive as  their horns, but they still had plenty of nerves.</p><p>"I'll  be fine," Akane said as she waited for the tear to seal. The accelerated  healing she had was nice, but it felt so strange. Mother feeding her energy to  help speed up her healing was also strange.</p><p>Akane laughed at that. Everything about her  new body felt strange. Though having her body repair itself before her eyes <i>was</i> rather weird.</p><p>"You  sure?" Ranma asked, concern on her face. "We can walk the rest of the  way," Ranma paused, then added with a slight grin, "Or I could carry  you."</p><p>"I'll  fly," Akane grumbled as she readied her wings.</p><p>"Be  careful," Ranma said as she watched Akane take off. It was a bit mean, but  she had to push her kids. Ranma followed the Akane and was glad that the rest  of their flight path was uneventful. Ranma smiled as she watched Akane burst  out of the forest and increase her speed a bit as she crossed the Tendo's  backyard.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Major  Nodoka Saotome, Doctor of Materials Science and Engineering, was in the Tendo  living room working on her laptop. Displayed on the screen were the lab results  on a sample of the material the captured Inter-Dim gate was made out of. Her  next task was to develop ways to synthesize the material. She had a fair idea  of why WIC wanted that ability.</p><p>She had the  house to herself. Her husband and Soun had left shortly after Nodoka had  arrived. The Science and Technology Section agent smirked at that. It looked  like Genma was still rattled, which was good.</p><p>Nabiki had  left a couple minutes ago. She said she was going out to meet friends. Nodoka  hoped that Command had a team watching the girl. Lt. Tendo had gone out  training with her strike team. Nariko was spending most of the evening with her  Father and should return sometime before her bedtime.</p><p>According  to the observation team, Ranma and Akane had gone out to get something to eat.  The strange part was that her son was... her son. Ranma had gone out with Akane  in male-form. Nodoka had asked Nabiki about the event and was pleased to hear  about Akane's gift.</p><p>The agent  had resumed her work when her phone started to ring. "Major Saotome  here," she answered automatically.</p><p>"Major,  we have an incoming Pattern D," one of the agents running the surveillance  on the Tendo property said.</p><p>"Can  you tell who it is?" Nodoka asked as her hand went to her sidearm.</p><p>"We're  getting another pattern! It's... it's a D-Silver 10," the agent said with  relief.</p><p>"Good,"  Nodoka said, her hand still on her gun. It stayed there until she got a clear  view of the demons entering the house.</p><p>"How  was your day?" Nodoka asked her daughter and granddaughter. She noted that  Ranma was not in her Senshi form. Nodoka wondered if Ranma had increased her  power levels or if she simply had the same power level in either form now.</p><p>"Good,"  Ranma said as she ran her hands through her soaked mane of crimson hair. She  had folded her wings against her back and was slipping out of her muddy boots.</p><p>"Oh  Akane, you got a phone call," Nodoka said as she retrieved the message she  had stuck to the refrigerator.</p><p>"Hmmm,  Yuka called. Looks important," Akane said as she looked over the note. The  demoness then walked to the phone and dialed the number.</p><p>"Okay,  I'll be down the hall," Ranma said before she headed off to the bathroom.  "Damn little succubus bladder," Ranma grumbled to herself.</p><p>Akane  dialed the number. Her old friend answered. After the pleasantries were exchanged,  Yuka got to the reason she had tried to call Akane. The blue-haired succubus'  eyed flared in response. Akane tried to keep her tone even but was unable to  control herself.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Ranma was washing  her hands in the first floor bathroom. A quick check confirmed that her eyes  still had the same violet content. Part of her had hoped that today's events  would somehow reverse the changing in her eyes.</p><p>The  redhead's attention shifted. She heard her daughter's pained cry, but more  directly, she felt it. Ranma tore out of the room and ran to her daughter. She  found Akane kneeling on the kitchen floor holding a phone. The dial-tone drone  could be heard under the sound of Akane's crying.</p><p>"What  happened?" Ranma asked as she stepped down to her daughter.</p><p>Akane  paused in her sobbing long enough to make eye contact with Ranma. "I  called Yuka and..." Akane shuddered and folded her wings over her chest.</p><p>"Is  she okay?" Ranma asked as she put her hand under Akane's chin so she could  look into her daughter's face.</p><p>As she  nodded, Akane emitted a small whimper. Tears resumed their stream down her  face. "She's... she <i>was</i> my  friend."</p><p>"What  happened?"</p><p>Akane tried  to gather herself. "Yuka... can't handle it. She said she always knew  something was off with me," the demon's tone had hardened a bit at the end  of the last sentence. "I wasn't even being too open with Nariko!"  Akane exclaimed.</p><p>"I  know," Ranma said as she hugged her. She had taken pride in her daughters'  restraint. During school, they had hardly even held hands. The redhead sighed.  She could guess what the call was about now. Akane just lost a friend.</p><p>"Maybe  tomorrow-" Ranma tired to suggest before she was cut off.</p><p>Akane shook  her head and resumed her crying.</p><p>Ranma held  onto her daughter. Her hand moved up to Akane's right horn. The redhead gently  rolled her fingers over the protrusion. Akane's pupils dilated as her sobbing  stopped. Akane leaned on her mother and almost started to purr, almost.</p><p>"Feeling  better now?" Ranma asked. The redhead stopped and looked at her daughter.  "Akane?" Ranma inquired her concern increasing. The blue haired  demon's face had started to contort.</p><p>Akane's  eyes suddenly flared a brilliant blue. "How could you!" the demoness  cried as she backhanded her mother. Ranma was knocked backwards onto the  kitchen floor.</p><p>The  blue-haired girl stood up. She glared down at her mother. The glow in her eyes  stopped and was replaced by tears. "I can't believe it! Is that all you  can do when I cry? Use my horns to drug me?"</p><p>"I..."  Ranma said, dumbly. Before she could get further, her daughter had stormed out  of the room.</p><p>"What  happened?" Nodoka asked after her daughter got up.</p><p>"I'm  not sure. Akane lost a friend. I tried to comfort her." Ranma shook her  head and started walking towards the stairs.</p><p>Major  Saotome followed Ranma.</p><p>"Akane,  what's wrong?" the redhead asked after knocking on the locked door.</p><p>"Go  away!" Akane cried.</p><p>"Let  me in so we can talk about this," Ranma suggested.</p><p>In her  room, Akane shook her head. She knew what Mother had done the last time she had  locked herself in her room. "Stay out!"</p><p>"Akane..."  Ranma pleaded.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>The redhead  considered her options. Forcing her daughter, by either knocking the door down  or badgering her to open the door did not seem like a good idea. However,  leaving Akane to stew in her room might not be wise either. Ranma looked to see  her own mother standing in the hallway. "Mom... could you help?"</p><p>Nodoka  paused before answering, not out of uncertainty, but out of bizarreness. Her  son was asking for help in a mother-daughter dispute, and her son was the  mother... the <i>demonic</i> mother.  "Of course, Ranma."</p><p>"Akane,  it's grandma. Can I talk to you?"</p><p>Akane  looked up. Grandma was human. She would not be able to control her, not like  Mother. "You can come in, but not Mother... not yet," Akane added.  She got up and unlocked the door. The sobbing demoness looked at her mother. A  part of her wanted to embrace mother and let her protect her, but another still  felt betrayed, not just at her mother but at her body for feeling that way.</p><p>Ranma  smiled when she watched her mother go into Akane's room. Her expression soured  when she saw her daughter glare at her and slam the door shut.</p><p>"What  happened?" Nodoka asked sitting down next to the demoness.</p><p>"After I called Yuka. Mother rushed to my  side. She was holding me and..." Akane paused. "She touched my... my  horns."</p><p>"Those  are very sensitive." Major Saotome said after she recalled what Pattern D  biology she knew.</p><p>"She  just used these to drug me," Akane said as she put a hand to one of the  little horns that poked out of her hair.</p><p>"I'm  sure your Mother was just trying to help you," Nodoka said. The agent was  beyond caring about the strangeness of the situation. "She's very proud of  how well you're developing."</p><p>"Is  she? I gave Mother a gift today. Some clothes for her human form, and what does  she do to me? She shuts me up when I start complaining!"</p><p>"Ranma  was just trying to make you feel better. She's your mother; she loves  you," Nodoka countered.</p><p>"If  Mother really <i>loves</i> me, why is she  trying to control me? Can't Mother respect me? I tried to show her that I  understood her... <i>him</i>, and I got  treated like a... minion!" Akane growled before resuming her crying.</p><p>"I'm  sure it was a mistake. You can tell Mother that," Nodoka suggested.</p><p>Akane shook  her head.</p><p>"Why  not?"</p><p>"I'm  afraid. This body... my body <i>wants</i> to  be with her. She's my mother. It hurt to hit her like that, but I didn't want  her to control me," Akane sighed as she leaned onto her grandmother. The  succubus needed physical contact with someone.</p><p>The agent  looked into Akane's subtly inhuman eyes. "Missing your mother and not  wanting to displease her is a perfectly natural thing for both humans and your  kind."</p><p>"My  kind," Akane sighed.</p><p>"It's  great that you're remembering who you are and becoming a real person  again." Nodoka reached around and ran her hand over the demon's wings. She  stopped when she found the spot where the wings went into the girl's back.  "But you are not human. You are a demon. You have to accept your body, its  urges."</p><p>"Mother  said the same thing. 'Some urges we can fight, some we can't.'</p><p>Nodoka  nodded. "Your mother's in the same situation you are. She's learning as  she goes. She has to put her humanity aside to raise you two. You have to deal  with being a demon. She has to deal with being a demon and a mother. Please let  her in. I promise she won't touch your horns."</p><p>"Okay,  let her in," Akane said after a moment's thought. She knew that Mother did  not really want to control her; if Mother did she would already be completely  enthralled.</p><p>Nodoka  opened the door and Ranma stepped through. The redhead was still fully  manifested. Her tail nervously swished back and forth.</p><p>Akane got  up and crossed the room. She stood facing her mother. Her tail was just long  enough so that it could snake around and touch Ranma's knees. The demoness  wiped her eyes and began to talk.</p><p>Nodoka was  off to the side watching. Much of what Akane had said to Ranma was identical to  what Akane had told Nodoka. The brood mother's stance was depressed. Her head  was held level but her wings dropped and her tail hung almost straight down.</p><p>"Come  over here, Mother," Akane said when she had finished her rant. She could  see her mother's black horns had not been hidden.</p><p>Ranma  nodded and walked over. She was surprised to find her daughter had pounced on  her. Akane held onto her mother. Ranma returned the gesture and failed to  notice when her daughter had moved one of her arms.</p><p>The  redhead's eyes widened and she tightened her grip on her daughter. She then  folded her wings over Akane's body and started to purr. Akane pulled her hand  away from her mother's right horn and watched as the redhead regained herself.</p><p>"Mmm...  Akane?" Ranma sluggishly asked. Her wings still enveloped her daughter.  Ranma blinked. "Oh... I'm sorry, Akane." The redhead then pulled her  wings back behind herself.</p><p>"There's  one thing you can't ever do! It's okay to hug me or hold me... like a real...  human... mom might. Just don't do that!" Akane said her eyes focused on  her mother's.</p><p>Ranma held  her daughter. She looked at the little horns on the girl's head. It would be  easy for her to dominate her children and make them into whatever she wanted: her  seductresses, hunting partners, servants, concubines, or lieutenants in an ever  larger brood. Anything except the one thing that would be worthwhile, the one  thing that would be hard for her to do. Something that would require her to be  a mother instead of a mistress.</p><p>It was  difficult enough for Ranma to not use the dominance that already existed  between her and her kids. Her children were bonded to her. Ranma could feel it  and sometimes could almost see it. The brood mother did not want to add any more  methods of control, especially one as potent as the horns were.</p><p>This made  Ranma's decision an easy one. "I promise to never use yours or Nariko's  horns again."</p><p>Akane  studied her mother's face. Her mother listened to her when Mother could have just  rubbed her horns again. She sighed. Mother was still a very, very powerful  force in her life.</p><p>"Akane,  I'm sorry," Ranma said still holding her daughter.</p><p>"I  know. I'm still wary but..." Akane sighed and leaned onto her mother. She  only felt the <i>normal</i> connection  between herself and her mother. There was no extra bit of control.</p><p>Nodoka excused herself and left the  two demons to each other.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>The  bar had an atmosphere of a bad detective television show. Sitting on the stools  around a seedy countertop were the dregs of humanity. An old man with far too  many stories to tell sat on the end, away from the others, whispering dark  secrets into his glass of whiskey, hoping that this would unlock more secrets  of the universe.</p><p>A  few stools down, sat a woman in her late forties. The years hadn't been kind to  her. That didn't dissuade the slimy salary man who sat on the adjacent stool  from leaning into her for a moment. She then slugged him for the third time in  the last ten minutes.</p><p>Next  to the so called couple sat a mage. Although the other patrons just took him  for another low-life, he was here for a purpose. He sat silently and ignored  the pair as they went back into their touch here, punch there match. He had  business to attend to and waiting in this seedy dive was part of it.</p><p>The  barkeep, a man in his thirties, but looked like he was in his fifties, belched  as he placed a worn rag on the counter. He rubbed the countertop in an attempt  to look busy because the rag was filthier that the counter he was cleaning.  "So, ya gunna order somethin', or not?"</p><p>The  mage placed his elbows on the table and whispered. "I like women's  underwear."</p><p>The  man's eyes glazed over. He slowly stuttered. "Y-y-yeah..."</p><p>Calmly,  the man continued. "I think I'll go get some."</p><p>"I  think I'll go get some."</p><p>The  runic mage smiled. He loved his powers. "There's some, right over  there." He pointed at his neighbors.</p><p>The  bartender slowly backed away and edged toward the left. Murdock looked at the  clock on the wall and noted the time. One thing was for certain, his employer  was punctual. He got up and walked to a hidden booth in the back of the bar.  His face, an evil grin as the screams of "Pervert", "Sicko"  and "Die, scumbag" were being shouted from the bar behind him.</p><p>He  slid into the booth and just as he got comfortable, a familiar female voice was  heard from behind a partition. "Having fun again, I see."</p><p>"It's  all part of my grand plan," Murdock assured as he straightened his silver  tie clasp.</p><p>The  woman gave an oft used sigh. "Murdock, Murdock, Murdock... you can lie to  the demons, the Senshi, the humans, but you know better than to lie to  us." A smile crossed the woman's face. She could not see him, but she knew  that the mage had stiffened in his seat. There were few things that Murdock was  frightened of, and the associates she represented were on the top of that list.</p><p>"I'm  just having some fun. The job's actually ahead of schedule," he said in a  voice reminiscent of a school boy swearing that his book report was <i>almost</i> done... he just had to read the  book.</p><p>"And  what progress have you made? The Alexia situation is beyond repair."</p><p>"Is  it?" Murdock said in an amused voice.</p><p>Now  the woman was glad that she could not see Murdock. That lopsided, inane, and  insane grin disturbed her. Not because she was afraid of him, but it made her  doubt the wisdom in using him. "Have you found a way to salvage the  situation?"</p><p>"Nope!"  Murdock answered cheerfully.</p><p>The  woman swore under her breath. She stopped when she realized that the only  person who could understand what she was saying was Murdock. "Please  justify your continued... employment," the woman said after composing  herself.</p><p>Murdock's  answer was prompt and almost professional. The sudden shift would have annoyed  the woman but she knew that Murdock had finally gotten to brass tacks.</p><p>"While Alexia has failed to start  DarkStar's true emergence, she was just a minor step in the plan," Murdock  assured. There were other parts to the plan. Ones that had been working since  day one. However, the spell that he had placed on Ranma was already degrading.  The mage supposed he could reapply it, but it was not worth the risk. Already  the limiters he had placed on her clothing had vanished. It was only a matter  of time before the other aspects of the spell broke down.</p><p>Murdock  continued. "Her continued existence could even be of use, but not in the  way I first planned. Ranma's now a mother. This gives us a unique bargaining  position." The woman knew that Murdock's smile had gone from inane to malevolent,  and it relieved her.</p><p>"You  still believe that the redheaded demon will give us what we want?"</p><p>"She's  one of two people," Murdock shrugged. "Right now I'm working on  procuring the other one."</p><p>"Good.  We cannot accept failure in this mission. Understand?"</p><p>"I  serve the Order," Murdock replied automatically. If this mission really  was that important to his handler and her superiors, wouldn't they assign more  than just him to the mission?</p><p>That  thought gave Murdock pause. <i>What if I'm  not the only one they assigned? Sure, I'm the best, but if it's that important  to them... Why didn't they tell me? Why haven't I met anyone else? </i></p><p>"Good.  I knew we could trust you," the woman said as she got up.</p><p><i>Really?  I'm not so sure anymore.</i> Murdock thought as he turned to watch the woman  leave. From behind she looked unremarkably average. Her eyes, which he had not  seen tonight, were quite interesting. They were a shade of grey that he  normally only saw in the mirror.</p><p>Once  she was gone, Murdock returned to the bar and ordered a drink from the waitress  who was covering for the... indisposed bartender. This bar was no Red Turtle,  his preferred watering hole, but it would still get the job done.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>As Nabiki  exited the bathroom, she heard a familiar Norman Blake song. Though someone she  would never expect was singing it. The simple song attracted the teenager to  the room where it was originating from.</p><p>Quietly,  she leaned onto the close door. The voice stopped after signing "I'll  always love you and make you happy."</p><p>"You can come in, Nabiki," Ranma  said with some annoyance.</p><p>The middle  sister opened the door. She first saw her sister sleeping on the far side of  the crowded bed while in the center an upright-sitting Ranma cradled a fitful  Nariko. "You're not naked?" Nabiki asked. It was a pleasant surprise  to not have to deal with another nude demon.</p><p>"I  summoned this when I sensed you at the door," Ranma said, pointing to the  simple black violet-trimmed bra she was wearing. Nariko made a whimpering noise  but stopped when her mother hugged her tighter and increased the flow of energy  going into her. Ranma took comfort that Nariko was taking her energy as opposed  to a more traditional nursing method, one that would prevent her from wearing  something over her breasts.</p><p>"What's  wrong with her?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Nightmares,"  Ranma said simply. She had been woken up by her daughter's crying and had  immediately gone to her aid.</p><p>"Oh,  I'm sorry," Nabiki sympathized.</p><p>"Akane  has them more often, but hers were earlier tonight. They were a bit lighter,  too. But now, it's Nariko." Ranma hoped it was not because Nariko had  spent the afternoon with her father and not her mother.</p><p>"Because  of how Akane was turned?" Nabiki asked. She could hardly imagine what her  sister had gone through.</p><p>Ranma  nodded. Often in Akane's nightmares Kasumi was unable to stop... Eclipse. Ranma  turned her attention back to her daughter. "It's okay. Nari-chan. Mommy's  here," the redhead soothed her daughter.</p><p>Still  standing at the door, Nabiki cocked her head. It sounded like Nariko was  quietly whimpering something.</p><p>Ranma, who  was closer and had better hearing, was able to make out what her daughter was  saying. "Mommy, please don't leave... I... I love you. No... stay...  stay." Nariko's cries degenerated into pathetic sniveling.</p><p>After  skipping a few lines to Nariko's favorite part, the redhead resumed. "You  are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy, when skies are  gray," Ranma sang to her daughter, with a small smile on her face.</p><p>"So  that's why you were singing."</p><p>Ranma  nodded as she continued to sing. Nariko quickly stopped her crying and settled  down. Nariko even started emit the purring-like rumbling that succubae were  prone to give off.</p><p>The redhead then looked up at Nabiki.  "She really likes this song. It helps her. I used to rub their horns when  this happened-" Ranma said with a quick glance at Akane's sleeping form.  "-but I've stopped. I don't do that anymore."</p><p>Nabiki nodded.  She had heard about the fight between Akane and her... mother. "Well, I'll leave you to your kids. Good night,"  Nabiki said before leaving the room and closing the door behind her.</p><p>Nabiki was  busy trying to digest the information and did not notice the person who had  silently moved next to her. "Kasumi!" Nabiki exclaimed once she  recognized who was in the hallway with her. "What are you doing up?"  she asked in a quieter voice.</p><p>"I  just got in from some night training," Lt. Tendo explained. "Why are  you up?"</p><p>"Bathroom.  Then I heard Ranma singing." Nabiki shook her head. She was actually a  little bit jealous of her little sister. Akane had a mother now. Though the  price was still very steep.</p><p>"Is  Akane having nightmares again?" Kasumi asked. She had heard Ranma's  late-night lullabies several nights ago.</p><p>"Right  now it's Nariko."</p><p>Kasumi  nodded. She got nightmares too. Especially the one where she relived getting  her face spattered in gore when a friend got hit next to her. Kasumi was not  wearing goggles at the time and a shard of Ensign Robert Talbert's skull had  almost hit her right eye. In some nightmares organic shrapnel hit both eyes  blinding her, in others she could still see but the experience froze her, and  when the enemy attacked again she hesitated...</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>It was  inevitable. Multiple groups were observing Ranma's brood. Two groups - really  more of lone representatives - used remote viewing methods, that while subtle,  were limited in their capability. Two others used a more direct method that put  them at risk. The one group that operated with Ranma's knowledge had the most  complete coverage, but that was to be expected. All of these groups were  hostile to each other to one extent or another. No matter how discrete they  were, at least two of these groups were going to meet.</p><p>To the  south of Furinkan was the Regis Building, a small business park. The office  space on the fourth floor was vacant and unused, save for two teens. "And  that's the first bus," Ukyou said as she watched the trio of demons enter  the school building. "You got the time?" the Assembly Acolyte asked  as she put her binoculars down.</p><p>"Yes,"  Ryoga said as he looked over the notes he had written. It was dull work, but  they knew what car the demons used to get to school and when they arrived.  Already they had physical descriptions of some humans that they associated  with, arrival and departure times of other vehicles, where the brood lived, and  a few other tidbits.</p><p>"Shame you can't go  undercover," Ryoga mussed.</p><p>"With agents and demons in the  school?" Ukyou asked with an amused laugh.</p><p>"I knew the Company was a bunch  of filthy mercenaries, but to associate with demons? Have they no shame?"</p><p>"They must have a reason,"  Ukyou defended, sincerely hoping that they did. She wanted out of the Assembly,  but she did not want to be stuck with an organization that was worse.</p><p>"They seek power. They're just  a bunch of heartless mercenaries profiting from these unholy monsters. You know  what they do with the bodies of the demons they kill," Ryoga snorted.</p><p>"We'll just have to make sure  we get these demons first then," Ukyou said, changing the subject. She had  found that it was best to cut off her partner's rants early, before they had a  chance to build up.</p><p>"Yes, Ranma will pay for his...  no, <i>her</i>," Ryoga corrected with a  smirk. "-crimes as a traitor to humanity." The Assemblyman's grin  grew exposing his own pair of fangs.</p><p>Ukyou looked at those canines with a  hint of revulsion. Her partner always had them, but they had slowly been  getting slightly more noticeable. His eyes were also getting increasingly...  strange. She had seen simmialr changes  in other acolytes as they increased their powers, thought the original length  of Ryoga's teeth only exacerbated things.</p><p>Ryoga's stance suddenly stiffened.</p><p>"What is it?" Ukyou asked</p><p>"Can't you feel it?" Ryoga  asked as he stood up and checked his weapons.</p><p>Ukyou paused and concentrated on her  own powers. "Succubae?" the brunette asked, feeling their presence.  It was foggy and she had doubts as to their power levels, but there were  demonic presences entering the building.</p><p>"Yes," Ryoga agreed.</p><p>"Damn, Ranma's brood must have  spotted us and is coming," Ukyou said as she stowed her binoculars and did  her own weapons check. All thoughts of defection were pushed aside as training  took over.</p><p>"There's a powerful demon  coming, but it's not Ranma," Ryoga said. His powers were sharper than his  partner's and he described the group of demons coming as best as he could  sense.</p><p>"Plan?" Ukyou asked.</p><p>"I'll take point. We'll have to  see where they're going for anything more specific" Ryoga replied.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Nari-chan,  breakfast's ready," Ranma said after entering the dining room.</p><p>"Okay,  Mommy," Nariko said without looking up from the small pink book before  her. Holding a pen behind her canines, the girl stared at the current page. She  then removed the implement and wrote a couple words.</p><p>"Working  on homework?" Ranma noted the little pink book. She did not recall being  assigned any essays yesterday, and she, Nariko, and Akane had all been  transferred to the same classes.</p><p>As her skin  reddened just a hint in her species' version of a blush, Nariko shook her head.</p><p>"Nari-chan?  Is this about last night? If you want, I can be with you next time you meet  your father."</p><p>"It's  not that," Nariko said, breaking eye contact with her mother. "I love  seeing Daddy." The demoness let the statement drop. She did not fully  understand why her parents did not get along, but she knew that they did not.</p><p>"And  your nightmares?"</p><p>"I'm  getting better," Nariko admitted.</p><p>"Yes,  you are," Ranma said with a smile. Her daughter was becoming more  independent. It was very gradual, but it was in the right direction. Even Akane  would be hard pressed to spend an entire afternoon away from her Mother.</p><p>"I've  got you to sing to me," the red-eyed succubus grinned.</p><p>Ranma  laughed nervously. In retrospect Nabiki's interruption had been rather  embarrassing. "So what're you doing?"</p><p>"Last  night, Daddy suggested that I keep a diary," Nariko said as she closed the  book</p><p>"Why?"  Ranma asked, her curiosity getting to her.</p><p>Nariko  paused. She looked down at her dairy. "It helps me keep track of...  things." Nariko sighed. It was hard for her to articulate her point. Even  as a human, she had never been that mentally agile. That was why she had gotten  the diary.</p><p>"Sounds  nice," Ranma said. Even if Nariko's diary was filled with girlish  prattling and odes to her mate and Mommy, it was still a good thing for Nariko  to do.</p><p>"It's  pretty fun."</p><p>"Nariko,  how do you feel about Tatewaki?" Ranma tried to ask it casually, but her  tone had shifted,</p><p>The  red-eyed girl froze. "I think…" she started before her eyes darted  down to the diary. "I haven't written about that, yet. Sorry Mommy."</p><p>"Oh, I  see." Ranma smiled at her daughter. She had a feeling that there might be  more to this diary than she first thought.</p><p>"Is  Auntie Kasumi cooking sausages?" Nariko asked as she licked her upper lip.  In addition to the frying meat, she could smell cooked batter and maple syrup,  but the flesh held her attention.</p><p>"No,  she's already left for work."</p><p>"Akane's  not cooking, is she?" Nariko asked.</p><p>"Well...  she's really just helping me," Ranma said. Akane was so eager to help, and  if she was watched carefully...</p><p>"But  she's alone now. You should go and check on her," Nariko suggested.</p><p>"It's only been a couple  minutes." The redhead saw the downcast concern on her daughter's face.  "I think you're right, Honey," Ranma said before returning to the  kitchen. She could not smell anything burning but that only eliminated one kind  of kitchen disaster.</p><p>Nariko  opened her diary. It looked like she had some time to add a few more sentences.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Alexia had planned  on doing some final observations of her enemy. She had brought her strongest  minions, just in case the correct opportunity presented itself. The blonde  demoness sighed. The timing was off for a morning attack. Again the succubus  cursed those human hunters. Their technology forced her to maintain an  unacceptable distance from her prey. She would have another chance to deal with  that redheaded traitor later today.</p><p>Alexia and  her minions were in a pair of large vans parked in a lot far out of WIC sensor  range, yet still provided a line of sight to the demons observing the school.  Alexia was not watching the school, at least not visibly. She had other more  useful senses.</p><p>Her eyes  were closed as she opened herself to receive the energy emanating around her.  It was passive and undetectable to those sensors. The demoness noted with a  smirk. She could feel the glowing that marked the traitor and her illicit  spawn, the rhythmic flickering that marked the WIC sensors, and...</p><p>Alexia's  eyes opened in shock. Assemblymen, here? The demoness concentrated in the  direction from which source had come. One was fairly weak. The other... Alexia  frowned as she shuffled over the energy readings. An Assemblyman this powerful  could be a problem.</p><p><i>Or a good snack.</i> Alexia thought with a  laugh.</p><p>Either way,  these interlopers had to be disposed of. She would not stand for another group  of human hunters, and there were only two of them.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>The  receptionist to the Regis Building looked up to see a group of well-dressed  women entering. She looked over the visitors with some jealousy. They all had  nearly perfect bodies, especially the tall, tanned one in front. The woman  leading the group was tall with long, curly blonde hair and piercing green  eyes.</p><p>"Hello,  the people on the... fourth floor are expecting us," Alexia said after  checking to make sure that was where the Assemblymen were located.</p><p>"Of  course," the receptionist agreed. "Go right in." She normally  would have noticed that none of the women were carrying briefcases, but she did  not feel particularly observant for some reason.</p><p>"Thank  you," Alexia said with a wry smile. Humans were incredibly easy to  manipulate. The blonde demoness then lead her minions down a corridor and gave  them their orders.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"They're  coming," Ukyou said; her more rudimentary senses could tell her that much.  The Assembly acolyte idly touched one of the throwing weapons she had secured  to a bandolier. She had used them before joining the Assembly, only now they  were coated in a material that was more detrimental to demons. She supposed  that the words etched onto them helped too in some small way.</p><p>Ukyou  cleared her mind and concentrated on her surroundings and the sight picture  presented by her weapon.</p><p>Ryoga  looked back to check that Ukyou had a clear path to support him. "You know  what to do."</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"At  least you didn't burn breakfast too badly," Nabiki remarked as she drove  her car.</p><p>From the  passenger seat, Akane gave a sideways glance at her sister</p><p>"Good  thing Ranma came in to salvage it," the middle Tendo sister said.</p><p>Akane  glanced at her sister again but remained silent.</p><p>Ranma  wanted to tell Nabiki to stop picking on her daughter, but she thought Akane could  handle it. Those two had been sisters much longer than Ranma had been Akane's  mother.</p><p>"What's  wrong? This about you and Ranma?"</p><p>"Mother  and I are fine," the blue-haired demoness replied a bit curtly.</p><p>"That  true?" Nabiki asked Ranma. She noticed that Ranma was wearing a white  blouse with her school uniform instead of her unusual black one. She did not  know the importance of that change but made a note of it.</p><p>Ranma  nodded. Akane did not seem to have any problems sleeping in the nude with  herself and Nariko. Although, that was a very important part of their bonding  and development.</p><p>"You  going to be okay in school today, with Yuka and all that?" Nabiki asked  her little sister.</p><p>"Yes,"  Akane stated. Her mother had asked her this same question when they were  getting dressed today.</p><p>"Maybe  you should tone down the PDA's," Nabiki suggested, referring to Public  Displays of Affection.</p><p>Ranma then  felt something wash over her. Like the concussion that followed an explosion,  the redhead was hit by a quick impulse of energy. She could see that her  children had also sensed it. Akane and Nariko were confused. They had never  sensed anything like that, but their mother had.</p><p>"Ryoga,"  Ranma muttered before she sensed another bloom of energy. This was one that  Akane was able to recognize.</p><p>"Alexia,"  Akane uttered.</p><p>"What's  going on?" the driver, who could not detect the energy, asked.</p><p>"Pull  over and drop us off," Ranma ordered.</p><p>"Why?  What did you see?"</p><p>"Drop  us off <i>now</i>," Ranma stated in a  cold voice. "And after that go straight back to school. Find the WIC team  there. Wait with them."</p><p>Nabiki  looked at Ranma and held back her response. She found her will wilting and  complied. The car pulled over to the side of the road and stopped.</p><p>"Don't  follow us," Akane pleaded after she got out of the car.</p><p>Nabiki  looked at her sister's blue hair, then at the office building that the brood  was focused on. "Uh... yeah," she agreed. Nabiki resolved to continue  on to school. She did not want to end up like her sister or worse.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"Go!"  Ryoga shouted as he maneuvered his sword to slice open an incoming demon-tail.  The edge of the silvery blade flared green as it lopped off the fins from the  demonic appendage.</p><p>"But,"  Ukyou cried before she flicked a pair of her throwing weapons. The silver  spatula-shaped implements buried themselves into one succubae's neck and  another's chest. The special coatings on the weapons immediately and violently  reacted with the demonic flesh.</p><p>Ryoga's  bright green eyes tracked onto a tall blonde succubus that until now had stood  off to the side. He could sense her power wafting off of her; he could also  sense that she was holding back. "That's an order!" the Assemblyman  shouted after he used his umbrella-sheathed weapon to dispatch the demon in  front of him.</p><p>Ukyou  slowly nodded and backed out of the room.</p><p>"Poor  move, <i>human</i>," Alexia laughed,  putting special emphasis on the last word. "Together, you would have stood  a better chance.</p><p>Ryoga  simply smirked. His eyes flared green and from them spread a barely visible  aura that surrounded his body.</p><p>Alexia's  smile grew, and she lazily extended her claws.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Kasumi  looked out the Blackhawk's open door. The operations agent ignored the vibration  and noise that the helicopter produced, and tried to listen to the briefing  that Command was giving her and her team. Having the sound played directly into  their headsets helped.</p><p>"The  North York Observation Team has secured the area. We've detected heavy Pattern  D's and what looks to be a D-Silver. More teams are on route," Jacob's  even voice said before continuing on.</p><p>Lt. Tendo  nodded, cataloging the information and checking it with the heads-up display  projected onto her goggles.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"That's  odd," Sailor Orion remarked, as she watched a grey and green helicopter  approach from the east.</p><p>"What?"  Sailor Mercury asked as she checked the display on her visor.</p><p>"That  looks like a UH-60A Black Hawk. But it's <i>way</i>  too quiet/" Orion tapped one of the ends of her double bladed staff on the  ground.</p><p>"Let's  discuss armaments later," Mars grumbled. She glanced up to see a pair of  agents approach. Both were dressed in WIC combat gear. The Sailor Senshi could  tell their genders and skin color, but not much else.</p><p>"We've  got several Pattern D's in the building, including DarkStar and her brood.  Further Company support will also be here shortly," the female agent  stated briskly.</p><p>"Uh...  thanks," Sailor Moon replied. The blonde looked up to see the helicopter  circle the office building. Off to one side, and quarantined by another group  of agents, were the workers that had managed to escape the building. A pair of  strangely-gurgled screams indicated that not everyone had managed to escape the  Regis building.</p><p>Orion  perked her attention at that, but she followed the rest of the Senshi into the  building.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar scanned the office space before her. The blare of a fire alarm hurt  her ears, but she was getting used to it. She carefully stepped to avoid  spilled coffee, and a step later, spilled blood. The demoness could not see the  owner of the pooled fluids; however she could see some drops leading from the  main pool of blood</p><p>"Mother?"  Akane asked from her position next to Nariko.</p><p>"Get  ready," Ranma said as she formed a fireball in her hands. She had a fair  idea what had happened. She lobbed the white-flamed orb around a corner. The  magical napalm hit and started to consume both the human corpse and the  demoness feeding on it.</p><p>Inflamed,  the demoness started to turn, only to have her head kicked in by a redheaded  succubus. Following through, Ranma sliced diagonally across the chest of her  prey. The demoness fell onto the still burning human; her spine had been  quartered and her heart and lungs similarly severed.</p><p>Ranma  glared at the burning pile of human and demon and ceased her fires from  burning. She hardly had time to notice how normal it had become for her to  receive energy from her kills when another demon appeared.</p><p>This one  looked to see what had been her mate torn apart and tossed onto what had ended  up being the demon's last meal. "Integra!" the grey-haired demon  cried. She then snarled at the intruding demons, her claws and tail filaments  extended. She leapt at the redheaded demoness who dodged down and to the side.</p><p>Ranma  turned to see another demoness standing by the remains of an overturned  water-cooler. This one, a brunette, appeared to be a bit more powerful than the  previous ones. Sailor DarkStar could sense that her kids were handling the  grey-haired demoness.</p><p>Akane had  dodged around the growling demoness. She looked to see her mate go in and trip  the grey-haired demoness. Akane then flicked her tail up, intersecting the  collection of razor sharp filaments with the demoness' head. The head was  shredded into a pulp of mixed consistency. Surprisingly little blood sprayed  from the destroyed skull.</p><p>Nariko felt  the surge of energy go into her. She smiled at her mate - this kill was theirs.  It was shared between them.</p><p>Akane  returned the smile and licked her lips. A few drops of her prey's blood had  splattered on her.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Sailor  Orion managed to keep herself from vomiting, but it was difficult. The  auburn-haired Sailor Senshi could not get what she saw out of her mind. In a  meeting room they had just passed was a table. On it a young woman had been  dissected. She was not the first body the Senshi had run across, but unlike the  other bodies, this one was not torn apart. She was carefully sliced open and select  organs and choice cuts of meat had been removed. Orion tightened the grip on  her staff. To these monsters, humans were nothing more than food.</p><p>"You  okay?" Mercury asked.</p><p>"No."  Orion switched the orientation of her staff. She was careful to avoid hitting  Venus. Orion and the blonde were in the front of the group.</p><p>"Trust  me, she's not okay," Mars agreed from her rearguard position. She and  Orion had been the pair to check out the meeting room.</p><p>"I  hate that fire alarm!" Jupiter grumbled.</p><p>Sailor  Moon's response was cut short by Orion's shout.</p><p>"A little help!" Sailor  Orion thrust her staff forward and upward. The double edged silver blade of the  weapon cut through a succubae's shoulder and pinned her to the wall.</p><p>Sailor Moon  looked the succubus over. The demon was not Ranma nor one of Ranma's kids. She  prepared her attack.</p><p>Growling,  the pinned succubus pulled herself off the wall, ripping her shoulder open in  the process.</p><p>"Crescent  Beam!" Sailor Venus cried as she stumbled away from the demon's talons.  The magical attack blasted through the demon who stumbled to the ground.</p><p>Orion  looked at the broken demon and shuddered. She slammed her staff's blade into  the succubus' chest and stepped back to allow Moon to finish the succubus off.</p><p>After the  demon had been reduced to dust, Orion glanced down the narrow corridor. From  somewhere above and ahead of them came the sounds of fighting. "I guess I  feel a little bit better," she remarked as she watched the demon blood  dripping from her blades.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Sailor  DarkStar fired a fireball at the demon.  It impacted with the brunette demon's flaming aura and splattered  open. The two sets of flames battled  briefly. The white and violet flames  were then absorbed into the brunette's yellow ones.</p><p>The enemy  succubus summoned a pair of fireballs and  lobbed them at the demonic Sailor Senshi. The redhead dodged under the  orbs and tried to connect with her target.  Frustratingly, the brunette managed to sidestep and fire another volley  at Sailor DarkStar.</p><p>The redhead  rolled to the side and used her tail to sweep the other demon. The brunette avoided having her feet cut  apart but at the cost of her balance. Continuing her motion, Sailor DarkStar  thrust her arm into the brunette's chest.  Her claws easily slid past the flaming aura, but her fingers and hand  felt prickly and hot when they passed through it.</p><p>"Ha!  Your stupid fire-shield can't block that can it?" Sailor DarkStar snarled  as she pulled her arm back and let the freshly killed corpse fall to the ground.  "Though that is a useful technique," she muttered to herself.</p><p>The cause  of death was quite clear; the demon's ribcage had been punched through and a  part of her had been torn out. That demon should have been easy to dispatch,  but Ranma found her fireballs unable to penetrate that shield.</p><p>Instead,  Ranma had had to fight her more intimately. The redhead admitted that the enemy  demon had been quite fast and pretty skilled, but not skilled enough. The organ  the redhead held in her hand was proof of that.</p><p>"Mother?"  Akane asked as she walked over to see her mother take a small bite out of  something in the redhead's hand. The blue-haired demon watched her mother's  eyes flare with energy as she consumed the muscle.</p><p>Ranma  smiled as she used one of her talons to cut the heart into three pieces. She  then tossed the larger two to her daughters.</p><p>"Thanks  Mommy," Nariko said as she gulped down the meat.</p><p>Akane's  reaction was just as automatic. The piece of heart was caught and slipped down  her throat. "Mother?" the demoness repeated. "What'd you do that  for?"</p><p>"I  wanted to share with you," Ranma said sweetly. The redhead looked into the  corpse hungrily, but she had delayed more than enough. "Come on, this  place hasn't been cleared yet!"</p><p>"But,  Mom!"</p><p>"What?"  Sailor DarkStar asked, her eyes flaring slightly in irritation.</p><p>"Why'd  you do that?"</p><p>"I'm  sorry, but we don't have time for a full feeding," Ranma reprimanded,  missing Akane's concern.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"We've  got a secondary hit," Gabriel announced from his position at the  Blackhawk's Ostar series Pattern scanner. "Multiple Pattern D's  concentrated and not moving."</p><p>"Location?"  Kasumi asked.</p><p>"One  kilometer, north by northwest," Gabriel answered.</p><p>"Intercept  them?" Kasumi queried command.</p><p>"Reinforcements  are two minutes out," Jacob's voice transmitted into Kasumi's headset.</p><p>"Yes,  you have a go," Stillwater ordered over the communications link. From his  position at the head of WIC Toronto A's Command and Control Centre, he gave a  brief glance to his executive officer.</p><p>The  helicopter's pilot nodded and adjusted his course. Sophie and Aram gave the  pair of door mounted M144 armament subsystems, each consisting of a 7.62mm M60D  machine gun one final check and took position behind them.</p><p>"We're  right on top of them," Gabriel stated after checking the range.</p><p>"I see  movement in a large white van," Sophie said, just before the back doors of  that vehicle burst open. "Shit!" the agent swore as what seemed to be  a swarm of demons poured out. She depressed the trigger on the machine-gun and  raked the fire over the incoming demons.</p><p>The pilot  twisted the helicopter around and increased the altitude. He knew full well  what would happen if the demons reached the Black Hawk. As this happened,  Kasumi shouldered her weapon and fired a pair of 20mm high explosive incendiary  rounds into the van. The vehicle exploded with a flat crump and a somewhat  bright flash.</p><p>"Anything  left?" Sophie asked. She had stopped firing, but her finger still rested  on the gun's trigger.</p><p>"I'm reading  clear," Gabriel said.</p><p>"Request  a cleanup team," Kasumi said before giving their coordinates. She gave one  final glance at the fan of demonic body parts. Most of them were right by the  remains of the van's rear end, but a few had managed to get a bit further  before being shot down. "Sophie, go over the bodies again."</p><p>"Yes  ma'am," the agent replied, depressing the trigger.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"You're skilled, Acolyte. A few  years more experience and you might actually be a threat to me," Alexia  allowed with a slight smirk.</p><p>Ryoga kept silent and tried to press  on with his sword. The green aura surrounding him and his blade had begun to  dim. The Assemblyman concentrated. He had another ability; he might as well try  it. Father Oslo had taught him that one personally. Ryoga's mentor had told him  the technique was a sacred one the Assembly of Man had developed. In reality,  it's origins were much more mundane. The Assembly had procured it from a mining  engineer.</p><p>Ryoga concentrated, and the aura  around his arms intensified. He tilted his sword to one hand, cupped his other  hand, held the two next to each other, and shouted. "Shishi Hoko  Dan!"</p><p>A bright sickly-green bolt shot out  from Ryoga and sped to the demoness who intensified her shield and tried to  step to the side. It sliced through her flaming aura and hit her body near the  left hip. The blast sheared through the demoness tearing a large chunk out of  her.</p><p>"Insolence!" Alexia's eyes  flared, and she spawned a pair of fireballs that she pitched at the human.</p><p>Ryoga gritted his teeth and  concentrated on strengthening his aura. Twin fireballs slammed into him...  shattered, ignited, but his aura held. The exertion and the heat leaking through  caused his sweating to increase. The demon's wound was healing alarmingly fast.</p><p>Alexia lazily lobbed another  fireball at him. The magical napalm contained within this one splashed onto  Ryoga's green aura. It added to the flames that were already clinging to him.  The demoness waved her hand and the flames intensified.</p><p>Ryoga snarled and tapped into his  powers. The aura surrounding him expanded spreading into Alexia's flames and  snuffed them out. The acolyte then stared the demon down and readied his sword.</p><p>"Interesting,"  The unusually tanned succubus smirked. <i>He has quite the potential. He could be very useful, </i>Alexia  thought. As she dodged the Assemblyman's blows her grin grew. Even in his worn  down state he was... impressive. "I've come to a decision, human,"  the demon said as she grabbed his blade. Where she held it, the green light on  the blade snuffed out. No longer holding back, the demoness wrenched the weapon out of the  acolyte's hands and flung it across the room. Eyes of a darker shade of green  met the human's.</p><p>Ryoga rallied what remained of his  power and attacked. His training, his morals, told him to fight to the very  end. However when his eyes locked into hers, his will faltered.</p><p>Alexia smirked. Ryoga froze. A small  trickle of blood started to drip from his left nostril. "I guess I pushed  you a little hard," she laughed, watching a small trickle of blood drip  out of his right nostril.</p><p>Ryoga tried to move his body but  found that it was not just his powers that were dimming. He tried to fight her  presence, to block out the influence. "Ukyou was right; we should called  for more support. At least she got away..." Ryoga mumbled not quite  realizing he was actually talking. "I can't believe it. I never even got  the chance to kill Ranma!" Ryoga snarled and managed to clench his fists  just before falling forward...</p><p>... into the demoness' waiting  arms. "Oh, I think you'll get  your chance," Alexia said to the unconscious demon hunter as she hoisted  him on her back.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>Sailor DarkStar ran into what used  to be a copy room. At one end of the long room was a damaged human who was  fending off a group of succubae.</p><p>The demonesses turned from their  prey to see another trio of blood-spattered, leather-clad demons. The tallest,  a grey-eyed succubae with dark green hair and a face and scent that Ranma found  strangely familiar.</p><p>"Stop or the human dies,"  the green haired succubus said as she summoned a black and green fireball. She  felt silly using a mere human as a hostage, but Mistress Alexia had said such a  maneuver would work.</p><p>Ranma narrowed her eyes and made a  fireball of her own. "You're dead. All of you," the demonic magical  girl swore in a level voice.</p><p>Ukyou tried to keep her weapon held  ready, but her fatigue and damage made the weight of it problematic. She had  seen rival demon clans fight before. Hopefully the two groups would decimate  each other enough for her to be able to kill those that remained.</p><p>"Really, now?" the  green-haired succubus laughed as small flickering flames surrounded her and her  two companions</p><p>Sailor DarkStar paused. She hated  those damn auras. The redhead concentrated and felt the orb within her hands...  shift. "DarkStar Burst!" the redhead shouted as the orb propelled  itself from her hands.</p><p>The green-haired demoness saw what  looked like a glossy black sphere leap out of the redhead's hands and zoom  towards her. She growled and tried to release her fireball.</p><p>Ranma watched the sphere travel.  Before it impacted, she could almost make out small swirls of violet, crimson,  and silver either in the orb or on its surface. It hit the green-haired demon's  aura and exploded. Black shards exploded outward, passed through their auras,  and sliced into the three succubae; they exploded in secondary bursts.</p><p>Riddled with flaming holes, Alexia's  demons crumpled onto the floor.</p><p>"Wow... nice, Mother,"  Akane said.</p><p>As she absorbed their energy, Sailor  DarkStar looked over the broken bodies. Two were clearly dead; they had been  torn apart. The third was slightly less damaged. The lead succubus' grey eyes  flared in anger and then dimmed.</p><p>It was then that Ranma was able to  place the familiarity. The redhead was reminded of the young succubus with  light green hair; the one that Captain Jarvis questioned. Their scents were  close enough that they could have been sisters... or, perhaps before Alexia  turned them, brothers.</p><p>"What  a lame name though. My attack sounds like some sort of evil candy." Sailor  DarkStar shook her head. "Oh no..." The demoness ran over to the  human. She was slumped against the wall and had been hit on the arm by one  demon's fireball and grazed in the leg by a DarkStar Burst shard.</p><p>"How  bad is she, Mommy?" Nariko asked as she kept a watch on the doorway they  had entered.</p><p>"Can  you talk?" Ranma asked the strangely familiar teenage girl. Having a fair  idea what this girl's profession was, she kept some distance and eyed the  girl's hands.</p><p>Ukyou's  eyes focused on the redhead kneeling before her. She groaned and tightened her  grip on her weapon</p><p>"Akane!  Nariko! Get some medics! I sensed WIC on the lower floors," Ranma  explained.</p><p>"Hold  in there. You're not so bad," Ranma reassured the human. She could sense  that the human was not dying and in no need of... turning. The redhead puzzled  over who this girl was and what she was doing. It was obvious she was some sort  of demon hunter, and very likely she was in the Assembly. She was dressed in a  similar set of armor, cloak, and pants as Ryoga. Ranma supposed that was where  she had seen this girl. She was an old friend of Ryoga.</p><p>"Do  you know where Ryoga is?" Sailor DarkStar cautiously asked. She was unable  to sense that acolyte's very strong signature.</p><p>"Demons,"  Ukyou stated before losing consciousness.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"There  was one very strong Pattern D we have not accounted for, this could be the one known as Alexia. We're  going to do a full sweep of the building, while our aerial teams scan the  vicinity," Captain Jarvis said to the agents and magical girls that had  assembled in the building's lobby. "Lt. Morrison take your team and sweep  the-" Jarvis stopped to see a group of demons fly down the stairs and into  the entranceway. He was relived that his men kept their weapons ready, but did  not point them at the Pattern D's.</p><p>"Someone  survived up there?" Sailor Orion asked, when she noticed the stretcher  being carried by WIC medics.</p><p>"She's  from another organization, the Assembly of Man. I suppose Command will call  them and tell 'em we've got one of their men and send her back," Jarvis  explained.</p><p>Sailor Mars  concentrated on the casualty and tried to block out the blood splattered  demons.</p><p>"You  didn't find Alexia," Sailor DarkStar observed.</p><p>"No.  We only ran into a pretty weak demon," Sailor Jupiter said.</p><p>"Just  one? I had to fight like a dozen of them! And there are, what, six of  you?" Sailor DarkStar exaggerated as she watched the medics rush the  Assembly acolyte to a waiting vehicle.</p><p>-oo0oo-</p><p>"I  knew the Assembly would be trouble," Jacob noted sourly. He was standing  next to Commander Stillwater in the Command and Control Center</p><p>"Yes,  now we've got one wounded and what looks like another missing. I suppose we  could say a demon ate that acolyte," Stillwater grumbled.</p><p>"We'll  go over the bodies. Something should be left... unless Alexia took him,"  Jacob replied.</p><p>"I'm  not fully convinced Alexia was even here. We've searched the building and the  surrounding area."</p><p>"I'll  have the scanner logs checked and matched to what Forensic Pathology Section  finds. Maybe that powerful Pattern D was killed. Or maybe Alexia teleported out  before we got our jammers in place."</p><p>"Hell,  maybe she teleported out <i>after</i> we got  our jammers in place," Stillwater responded.</p><p>"That  would be an unpleasant thought."</p><p>End Chapter 9</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Thanks goes  to my prereaders for enduring my mistakes and making this story better: Jerry  Starfire, Black Dragon, Joe Fenton, Wray Loflin, Burger Bill, Kevin D. Hammel,  and Mike Koos.</p><p>Special  thanks goes to Burger Bill for his work on writing the first part of Murdock  scene.</p>
