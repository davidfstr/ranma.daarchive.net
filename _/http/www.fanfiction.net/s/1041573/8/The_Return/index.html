</div><p>Chapter  7 Response and Recruitment</p><p>Ranma looked at her parents. Her  mother was wearing a white lab coat that almost certainly had a firearm  concealed within it. Her father was maintaining a surprising level of  composure. The man was only fidgeting slightly, and he remained fairly silent.</p><p>"Now husband, is this your idea  of raising a 'man among men' ?" Nodoka asked in a cold, mostly dead voice.  "Look at her!" she then shouted as one of her hands dropped to her  waist.</p><p>"It was the Drake's idea,"  Genma replied.</p><p>"With a name like Sunshine, I  have no doubt. I told you that man was a bad influence. He's an irresponsible  lunatic," Major Saotome said flatly.</p><p>"I was simply trying to get the  engagement to work," Genma defended. He was still off kilter. He had not  expected his wife to simply walk into the kitchen and sit him down.  And now their son was here. It was almost as  if it was planned, as if events were choreographed... but that was absurd.</p><p>"I'm amazed that you haven't  screwed that up as well," Nodoka said as she narrowed her eyes. At least  Kasumi was a good Company girl, and she had a fair deal in common with Ranma.</p><p>"What's going on?" Ranma  asked. "I didn't expect you to be back so soon," the redhead was  still in her improved Furinkan High School uniform.</p><p>Genma's eyes widened with  realization. Ranma had found her mother and told her that they were at Soun's  place.</p><p>"Before Genma took you, he  wrote and signed an agreement. Basically it stated that if he failed to make  you into a 'man among men,' you'd commit suicide. This was supposed to make me  feel better about the abduction?"</p><p>"That's insane!" Ranma  cried. She then turned to her father. "You were under that agreement, and  you still put me in school as a girl. What the hell is wrong with you?"</p><p>"It was for your own  good," Genma said as his eyes tracked the exits. His friend Soun had left  the room, but Kasumi had entered the hallway that lead to the kitchen. He did  not see her move nor did he hear her arrival, but he had more pressing concerns  than the observation of Ranma's fiancee.</p><p>"Now, Genma I'm giving you a  chance to make things right," Nodoka said as she reached into her coat.  The steel machine she pulled out, while placed softly on the table, still made  a heavy metallic clunk. Nodoka then pulled back letting the firearm complete  her statement for her.</p><p>Genma looked at the gun. He blinked.  It was still there. The bore of the weapon stared back at him. He knew that the  backdoor was behind him. Escape was still an option.</p><p>Ranma shook her head; stupid Company  theatrics. Her mother could not be serious. If she really wanted him dead, she  would have just shot him. The Company had no problems with disposing of bodies.  The demoness then turned to see Kasumi alertly watching everything. The agent's  hand was on her weapon and she seemed ready to draw.</p><p>"Genma!" Nodoka shouted,  getting her husband's attention. "I'm giving you a chance to take the easy  way out," she then said in a much friendlier voice.</p><p>Genma looked at the gun then at his  wife. Putting his left hand on the table, he took a couple deep breaths. The  man then leapt to his feet, knocking his chair over in the process. He then  spun around and ran to the back door, which he tore open and dove through.  Genma then sprinted across the back lawn and disappeared into the forest that  surrounded the property.</p><p>Nodoka sighed and holstered her  sidearm. She then pulled out a cell phone and flipped it open. Nodoka entering  a speed dial number and establishing a connection. "We have a runner.  Stage one complete. Yes, I'd like to be picked up,"</p><p>"What just happened?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh nothing Dear, just a little  training exercise," Major Saotome said as she got up.</p><p>"You're going to have a bunch  of agents after him," Ranma observed.</p><p>"Of course I will. We have to  make sure he's not working for the enemy," the woman said to her daughter  in a soothing voice.</p><p>"What are you going to do to  him?" Ranma inquired. She was just starting to think that these guys might  not be so bad.</p><p>"Nothing too damaging I'd  suspect. Chemical means can extract just about anything now," Nodoka mused  with what seemed to be disappointment in her voice.</p><p>Ranma blinked, her eyes felt a bit  strange. "And now what are you going to do?"</p><p>"I'm going back to WIC  Toronto-A. The Commander wants to speak with me." The woman then turned to  the Operations agent. "Lieutenant, please make sure my son doesn't do  anything rash."</p><p>Kasumi nodded and turned her  attention to Ranma. "Please don't make this difficult."</p><p>"Why would I do that? I'm still  angry at the stupid oaf for this Sunshine crap. If a few Company goons are  gonna dope him just to find out what bars he stole from, why should I  care?" Ranma said in a muted tone. Her mind was distracted. It seemed like  Nodoka wanted to have Genma's death be payment for her absence in Ranma's life.</p><p>Kasumi smiled at this. Ranma was  taking that event most well. She then left the room. It would not do to watch  the redhead, and if she really wanted to go there was little Kasumi was allowed  to do to stop her.</p><p>The lieutenant's concerns were  unnecessary. Ranma sat at the table for a few minutes before going up to her  room.</p><p>"Stupid trees," Genma  mumbled as he dodged another branch. He had been on the run for about ten  minutes. His plan was to spend the hiding somewhere, a place that preferably  had a bar, and then come back in the morning. By that time his wife would have  either left or calmed down and Genma would have a fool-proof explanation, one  that would prevent her from taking out that gun. He almost wished his wife had  brought that damn sword of hers instead.</p><p>Before any of that could happen, he  would have to get out of this forest. His eyes widened when he saw the end of  the trees ahead. A few seconds after that he was able to make out an asphalt  centered cut in the woods. He knew there was a road behind Soun's house. The  martial artist's elation was cut short when he felt a pair of strange pains  flare in his chest. His pace staggered and he found it hard to concentrate.</p><p>Agent Morrison paused just long  enough to confirm his visual. Immediately afterward he depressed the trigger.  He then watched the projectile make contact with the target. His partner had  fired another shot. It too made contact. They waited for the target to go down  before the approached the body.</p><p>From his position, Genma saw two  shapes from just before the tree-line rise up. Their outlines were somewhat  humanoid, but they were broken up by a strange mesh of leaf litter and other  debris. They had weapons aimed at him.</p><p>"Bishop One to King. We have  the pawn," Lieutenant Patterson said after confirming that the target was  breathing, unconscious, hooded, and that his arms and legs had been properly  secured. The shackles on the man were rated for Class 4 and under. The agents  were sure they would hold for a human.</p><p>"This is King. Acknowledged  Bishop. Rook is ETA in six. Repeat. Rook in six," the voice responded in  Patterson's and Morrison's headsets. The senior agent then turned to the road.  All they had to do know was wait for the van to stop at the side of the road  and load their cargo onto it.</p><p>Genma's vision swam into focus. Or  at least it tried to. The room he was in was bright, far too bright. Several  lights were pointed at him. Behind them he could see several shadows moving  around that might have been people. The martial artist then noticed that he was  strapped into the chair he was sitting in. Even his hands and feet were  rendered immobile. He closed his eyes and tried to gather his thoughts but he  found the process sluggish.</p><p>"Ahhh, you are awake now? Very  interesting," a voice with a strange clipped accent said. Genma tried to  twist his head to see who was talking but he could only turn it a few degrees.</p><p>"I apologize for  inconvenience," the voice said emphasizing the G in the second word.  "But we must be ... certain that you will be... cooperative," the man  said, pausing as if to remember the correct word.</p><p>Genma was sure it was a man now, and  possibly a European man. He listened as the voice from behind him said a few  sentences in some language. He recognized the words "Hans" and  "und." The words "Königin" and "Pfandgegenstand"  were particularly odd and stuck in Genma's mind.</p><p>"Now my friend, we will talk. Yes?"  the voice from behind Genma asked in a jovial voice.</p><p>Genma froze when he saw the needle.  It was being held in a nondescript man's hand.</p><p>"Again, I apologize, but it is  your fault. If you hadn't run from us all those years ago. Why did you have to  take your son Gendo?" the man asked.</p><p>"That's not my name," the  martial artist said trying to break out of his bonds.</p><p>The interrogator simply laughed.</p><p>"Well, that was  disappointing," Jacob remarked after he finished watching the recording.  He was in Stillwater's office in WIC Toronto-A</p><p>"At least we've confirmed that  the man knows nothing relevant to our plans," the commander replied.  "The Major should be pleased at the other things we learned."</p><p>"Unless Genma has had his mind  worked over before," Jacob pointed out. The interrogation had gone by the  book and their subject was already released, but something nagged at his mind.</p><p>"If that's the case then he  would have been useless anyway. It also served as good training. I see that  Captain Jarvis has gotten more skilled with information retrieval."</p><p>"But that god awful  accent?"</p><p>Stillwater smiled slightly.  "Other than English, German was the only language all the agents involved  spoke. We had to give Genma the impression that we got the wrong man. I thought  the Captain's acting was quite good."</p><p>"Okay, he did pull that off  rather well," Jacob conceded. "I also like that rum spray idea. What  about Major Saotome's wishes?"</p><p>"They'll be granted for  now," Stillwater stated.</p><p>Genma woke up to the sound of wind  brushing through leaves and distant traffic. With a headache that normally  accompanied the darkest kind of hangovers, Genma pulled himself upright. He  fought off vertigo as he tried to take his bearings. He found himself sitting  in a gully in a lightly wooded glen. Looking at the sun, he guessed that it was  still early morning.</p><p>Stumbling, the man made his way  towards where he heard the cars. Genma soon found himself at the edge of a  paved road. As Genma followed the asphalt path, his mind slowly cleared.  Eventually he arrived at a familiar intersection and made his way back to  Soun's place.</p><p>While he walked back, Genma  considered what had happened to him the previous night. His memories were  jumbled and confused, but he knew that his wife had found him and he had been  abducted by some strange people, foreign men who thought he was some Gendo  character.</p><p>"Where's Pops?" Ranma  asked as she got into the kitchen. "Didn't he come back last night?"</p><p>"I haven't seen him," Soun  said with only a hint of concern. Genma normally ran off when faced with a  difficult decision. It was how his friend got time to think things over.</p><p>Ranma then turned to Kasumi who was  brewing coffee.</p><p>The agent shrugged at the  seifuku-clad redhead. Kasumi then turned to the front of the house. She had heard  the sound of an approaching car. "It sounds like we have guests," the  young woman observed as she walked towards the front door.</p><p>"Oh hello, Mrs. Saotome,"  Kasumi said respectfully as she opened the door.</p><p>"At ease young lady,"  Nodoka smiled. "Has my husband shown up yet?" she  asked. She hoped that the agents were not too  rough on him.</p><p>"Wait mom? You don't know where  he is?" Ranma asked skeptically.</p><p>"No I don't," Major  Saotome replied honestly.</p><p>Ranma was not sure how to respond to  that so she changed the subject. There was something else that was nagging on  her mind, something that had not let her sleep. It kept circling in her head.</p><p>"Mother,  I have a question. It's about that girl that I turned."</p><p>"Really what?" Nodoka  asked.</p><p>"I think that's Genma,"  Kasumi said, interrupting her fiance while pointing at a disheveled figure that  had just come into view.</p><p>"We'll talk later," Nodoka  assured her daughter.</p><p>"What the hell happened to  him?" Ranma asked as she walked over to her father.</p><p>"Looks like he's been  drinking," Nodoka observed. "He used to do this back when we were living  with each other."</p><p>Ranma held her tongue but she wanted  to know how often her mother threatened her father.</p><p>"He certainly smells like  it," Kasumi noted once they had gotten close enough to smell the odor  wafting off of the man.</p><p>"Nodoka, you won't believe what  happened to me!" Genma cried. He then spoke in a hurried pace. "I was  running through the woods and I had gotten abducted by these angry Germans.  They thought I was this Gendo guy, so they drugged me and asked me all these  weird questions. Then they found out I wasn't him so they dropped me off in a  ditch out in the woods."</p><p>"Definitely been  drinking," Nodoka noted.</p><p>"I was not!"</p><p>"You were drunk dear, you  probably hallucinated the whole thing," the elder Company agent said, her  voice darkening at the word dear. "Remember the day after our third  anniversary. You disappeared for a week and when you came back you swore you  had been kidnapped by aliens."</p><p>"This is different! I wasn't  drunk this time!"</p><p>"I'm sure it is," Nodoka  sighed. "Now if you don't mind I have something to discuss with our  son." Her eyes then narrowed. "I'm planning on talking to you  afterwards. Don't leave."</p><p>"So what do you want to talk about?"  Nodoka asked after Ranma had closed the door to her bedroom.</p><p>The redhead sighed and sat down on  the bed. Nodoka noticed that the girl's fishnet-stocking-encased legs were held  together at the knees. At least Ranma had enough sense to do that; that purple  skirt of hers was very short. Beyond a miniskirt, it was a micro-mini. The  older woman shook her head and sat down next to her child. The seifuku was very  racy, but at least she was wearing a uniform. Some demonesses found clothing  restrictive.</p><p>"I've done something  horrible," Ranma finally admitted as she made eye contact with her mother.</p><p>Nodoka paused. What was her son  admitting to? With her demonic body it could be any number of things. Keeping  her voice clear and free of distress, the major asked Ranma what she had done.</p><p>"It's about that demon girl you  saw me with. After I well... made her, I ignored her."</p><p>Nodoka nodded. She had noticed the  cold shoulder Ranma gave her minion in Operations Centre Three.</p><p>The redhead sighed, and looked at  her modified Furinkan High School girl's uniform. "I'm only now starting  to realize how inappropriate that was. All she wanted was some attention, but I  was too afraid."</p><p>"It's okay," Nodoka  soothed as she put her hand on the girl's shoulder. "Do you have any idea  what you should do?"</p><p>"Yes," Sunshine Saotome  said, staring at the wall. "But I'm not sure if I can go through with  it."</p><p>"You have to do what you think  is right," the agent advised. "No matter the price," she then  added somewhat to herself.</p><p>Hikaru Gosunkugi waited in the  hallway. His eyes narrowed when he saw Rod approach.</p><p>"You have the  translation?" Rod Ferris asked, grinning slyly.</p><p>Gos sighed and held up a rewritable  compact disc.</p><p>Ferris quickly pocketed the jewel  case stored media. "Isn't technology grand?"</p><p>Gos simply shrugged.</p><p>"What are you afraid I'm  wearing a wire?" Rod inquired. "Never mind. My associates are much  appreciative of this token."<br/>Gos looked the other teen in  the eye and walked past him.</p><p>Rod smirked and walked off in the  opposite direction.</p><p>Two floors above this exchange  another was taking place.</p><p>"Mistress, what's going  on?" Nariko asked after Sunshine locked the door to the Drake's office.  The principal was kind enough to allow them to talk privately in the room.</p><p>"I have something to confess.  Ever since I made you I've been treating you badly," Sunshine said,  looking at the other demoness.</p><p>"That's not true."</p><p>"Yes, it is. I've done nothing  but treat you like dirt." Sunshine said, using a decorative Canadian beer  themed mirror to study her reflection. "Normally, that'd be fine but you  are my responsibility, and it's time I owned up to it."</p><p>"So what are you  planning?" Nariko asked, expectantly.</p><p>"Nothing like that,"  Sunshine responded, sternly. "The thought of being romantically involved  with you repulses me, and it's not just because you were once male."</p><p>"What then mistress?"</p><p>"I spawned you," the  redhead said while gazing into her violet flecked blue eyes. "I'm your  mother. That's why I can't be romantic with you, why it repulses me so much,  but I can still love you as a parent. I have to take care of my child,"  Sunshine admitted haltingly. It was a strange concept to the redhead, but her  mother had provided good advice.</p><p>Nariko blinked. "Mistress?  Mother?" The black and violet haired demon did find that concept  appealing. The demoness before her had given her life.</p><p>"Yeah, that's it,"  Sunshine said as she turned to face the other girl. It was then that she felt  the bond between them. It was the connection between an elder demon and one of  her children. From that link she felt the absolute loyalty and devotion that  Nariko had for her. The desire for affection that had repulsed her so much was  now in a completely different light. "I'm sorry," Sunshine said after  her realization.</p><p>"Mommy!" Nariko shouted as  she bounded over to the other demoness. She then embraced the slightly taller  girl.</p><p>Sunshine tensed at first but then  she returned the hug. This was not some girl that was hitting on her this was  her flesh and blood. Nariko sighed happily, enjoying the sense of security and  protection that her mother gave off.</p><p>The redhead looked down at... her  daughter. It was hard to accept, but it was the truth. She sighed and hugged  her child tighter.</p><p>"I love you Momma," Nariko  said, happily.</p><p>Sunshine paused. She decided to go  with her gut. "I love you, too," she said as she stroked her  daughter's hair. The redhead then kissed Nariko on her forehead. It was the  simple loving kiss of a mother to her child. If Sunshine had turned to the  mirror she would have seen her eyes briefly flare purple before turning back to  blue with an increased density of violet flecks.</p><p>Two school girls were walking back  to their apartment complex. They were both dressed in the fuku of Furinkan High  School. One had fairly short blue hair and the other had longer, shoulder  length, auburn locks.</p><p>"Well, that physics club was a  bust," the somewhat taller girl observed sourly.</p><p>"They weren't that geeky,"  the other girl countered.</p><p>"Yes Ami, they were, but that's  not why I'm disappointed. They're not doing anything. Back in Cheyenne, our  physics club actually made things. These guys go to competitions where they  regurgitate physics trivia. That's interesting but eventually you have to do  something with what you've learned," Janet stated.</p><p>"What'd you guys do?" Ami  asked. Janet had shown her blueprints and photos of some of the machines that  she had built.</p><p>"Mostly fighting robots."</p><p>"Maybe they can do that  too," Ami suggested.</p><p>"I doubt it. Those guys don't  even have a work shop," Janet countered sadly.</p><p>Ami shrugged. She then looked at the  convenience store that they were about to pass. "You mind if we go in? I  have to pick up some orange juice."</p><p>"Okay." The two girls then  crossed the small parking lot. Only Janet paid particular attention to the  small puce-colored Honda that had pulled into the far end of the lot.</p><p>"Come on Davis. We have a  meeting to get to, and I for one don't want to be late," the man in the  passenger seat said.</p><p>"Sorry Mitch, I'm hungry,"  the driver countered. "It'll be a simple in and out. Just another dead  7-11 clerk. Not only will we get fed, but we'll have some spending money."</p><p>"It's broad daylight  though," Mitch stated.</p><p>"Are you afraid of some clerk?  We can take him out before he has a chance to do anything. Anyone else in  there's a bonus," Davis stated. He then opened his door and stepped out of  the car ending the discussion.</p><p>Mitch shrugged and followed his  associate.</p><p>Janet was browsing the snack aisle  when she saw two average looking men walk up to the clerk's counter. They were  dressed in black and dark blue sweats and looked like a pair of college  students stopping in for a quick snack, a fresh pack of smokes, or a case of  beer. She then watched as one distracted the clerk by asking for some lottery  tickets, while the other moved his arm towards the man behind the counter.</p><p>A lead-filled sap hit the  shopkeeper, and he fell to the ground. The taller of the two guys leaped over  the counter and pried open the register. The other then pulled a pair of large  revolvers. The guns were stainless steel and polished until they shined  brightly.</p><p>"Okay everyone! This is a  holdup!" the armed man shouted to the handful of patrons in the mini-mart.  "I'm sure you all know the deal. Keep them high were I can see them, and  I'm sure you'll be home before diner." he said in a reasonable sounding  voice. Davis smiled inwardly. Humans were so much like cattle, a few soothing  words and they would ignore the man with the maul.</p><p>Janet did not have her hands up. She  went down just after the clerk did. There was a chance that the robbers were  simply that. However, it was also a large coincidence that they attacked the  one store that had a Sailor Senshi in it.</p><p>Even if the two men were human, they  were still criminals. Janet knew what she had to do. Normally, she would have  drawn her weapon and taken them out right now, but there were too many  witnesses and she had to maintain her cover.</p><p>Staying down, she went to the back  of the store. The girl hoped to find a bathroom, or some other place she could  change without being seen. Janet did not see her friend Ami and hoped that she  was okay.</p><p>Janet quickly found herself in the  dog-legged hallway that lead to the stockrooms and a pair of bathrooms.  "God damn it," the girl quietly swore when she found out the door to  the women's room locked.</p><p>Ami had taken to leaving her Mercury  Computer on and in scan mode. She knew she was being paranoid, but the  precaution made her feel safer. It paid off, when in the beverage aisle her  computer started to beep. Recognizing the tone, she glanced around the store.  Her gaze fell on a pair of men that had just entered the store. She calmly made  her way to the back. If things turned bad, she wanted the ability to do  something about it.</p><p>Ami was in the small women's  bathroom when she heard one of the men start to shout out orders. Even if they  were simple criminals she had a duty to stop them, especially with Janet still  out there. She locked the door.</p><p>"Mercury Crystal Power. Make  Up!" Ami shouted, activating her Super Sailor Mercury form.  Having the transformation sequence occur in such a small space made for an  unusual spectacle.</p><p>After the lights died down, Sailor  Mercury turned to see someone try to turn the room's door knob. It turned  slightly before meeting resistance. Mercury then heard a familiar girl's voice  on the other side of the door swear.</p><p>The magical girl blinked, and walked  over to the door her in knee-high, high-heeled boots. If Janet was in danger,  she had to help her. Mercury unlatched the door and popped it open.</p><p>Janet's reaction to the sudden  appearance of a Pretty Sailor-Suited Warrior of Love and Justice was puzzling  to Mercury. "Oh, good looks like I'll have some help," Janet stated  after pausing to look at the Sailor Senshi.</p><p>Mercury then watched as Janet  shrugged off her backpack and pulled a weapon from behind her back. As her eyes  tracked the length of the metal object, puzzlement crossed her face. The  auburn-haired girl then held both her hands, one over the other, on the grip of  the handle.</p><p>Mercury stared in amazement at what  happened next. Janet smiled as she thrust the large gold and silver inlayed  hunting knife upward. Several points of white light flared on the auburn-haired  girl's forehead. They formed a somewhat hourglass-shaped figure. The  "belt" of the figure consisted of three points that formed a slanted  line. She then shouted, "Orion Constellation Power. Make Up!"</p><p>Bright green and purple light swirled around  the girl as her clothing dissolved. The etchings on the double edged blade of  her knife flared to life and the edged itself began to glow a golden color. As  Orion started to twist the weapon, the handle on it began to grow in length.</p><p>A white body hugging garment that  was very familiar to Mercury appeared on Orion's body. As that happened, the  purple light split into three parts. One went to her waist and formed a  pleated, white-trimmed, light purple miniskirt. The middle went to her chest  and formed a similarly colored collar. The last divided and went to her arms  forming purple-trimmed elbow-length white gloves.</p><p>The green light then divided into  three streamers. The first two hit her chest and the back of her waist. They  formed big almost neon green bows. The third went to her feet and formed a pair  of light green two and a half inch high-heeled pumps.</p><p>The girl continued to twirl her  weapon around. Its silvery handle, now over three feet long, continued to  elongate.</p><p>Jewelry then flashed into place. A  white choker appeared around her neck. On the front of it was a diagram of a  familiar constellation. The stars were represented using diamonds and the lines  connecting them were done in gold filaments sewn into the material. Her  earrings were bright green eight-pointed stars. A golden tiara then appeared.  Set in its center was an Alexandrite, a gem that seemed to change from light  blue to dark purple depending on how the light hit it.</p><p>Her hair was then styled slightly. It  was still center-parted and shoulder length. But now it looked like it was  freshly cleaned and brushed, making her auburn tresses shine. Makeup that was  slightly lighter than Ami's in intensity then formed into place.</p><p>By  now, her weapon was no longer a simple knife but a glaive-like object. Its  shaft, nearly six feet in length, was topped on either end by a long  double-edged blade.</p><p>"I'm  glad I finally found another one," the auburn-haired, apparently magical,  girl said as she adjusted her bladed staff and made her way forward.</p><p>Mercury  blinked at the other sailor-suited girl. "Sailor Orion?" She had  never heard anything about Senshi of constellations.</p><p>"Yeah,"  the other girl nodded. "Come on, let's do this," Orion said quietly  as she carefully approached the corner with her staff pointed forward and  slightly inclined. While staying low, she used one of the polished blades from  her staff as a mirror to check on the location of the two enemies.</p><p>With  her free hand, Orion pointed at Mercury and then moved the hand so that it was  horizontal. She then lowered the hand. Orion then pointed  right. Mercury nodded in understanding. The  other girl wanted her to crouch down and go around the store with her.</p><p>The  two girls moved out. Janet had halved the distance between the bathroom and  register, when Mitch turned to look at the movement in the corner of his eye.</p><p>"No,  not a Senshi," Mitch sighed as he gripped his weapon.</p><p>With  her cover blown Sailor Orion stood to her full height. "Convenience stores  are for quick transactions involving overpriced commodities. They are not a  harvesting ground for monstrous bastards. In the name of Orion, you will be  destroyed," the Senshi announced in a cold voice as her eyes narrowed.</p><p>"Davis help!" Mitch  cried, redundantly. His partner already had his guns trained on the green and  purple Sailor Senshi.</p><p>Mercury positioned her hands and  with a shout of "Mercury Aqua Rhapsody," fired at the creature. Her  eyes widened. It was too late. He had gotten off a couple of shots.</p><p>Sailor Orion's thoughts were  carefully controlled. This was what she had practiced for. There was no time  for second guesses, she had to act now. Assuming that Mercury was covering her,  Orion leaped at the shorter of the two enemies. In an efficient motion she  rotated the forward blade of her weapon through the target.</p><p>Mitch screamed as his left arm was  sliced off at the elbow. His eyes then tracked the girl in front of him rotate  her staff while increasing its pitch. He caught a glimpse of a blade heading  for his neck.</p><p>Just before the other Senshi's blast  connected, Davis watched his partner's decapitation. Davis did not even have  the satisfaction of hitting the girl. Poorly aimed, his shots hit nothing but  the dairy section.</p><p>"You okay?" Orion asked as  she warily looked at the two piles of ash.</p><p>"Yeah," Mercury replied.</p><p>"I didn't think it'd be so  fast," Orion commented.</p><p>"We should get going."</p><p>"Just let me get my bag,"  Orion said as she dashed to the restroom hallway, careful to not step into the  growing pools of spilt milk.</p><p>Mercury followed her after she  realized that she too had left her own book bag there.</p><p>"Where  are you staying?" Sunshine asked her daughter as they walked down a  subterranean corridor in WIC Toronto-A. The Company was more than happy to give  the girls a ride from Furinkan to their facility.</p><p>"With  father," Nariko stated.</p><p>"How  is he taking this? You're not having trouble with him?"</p><p>"No,  he seems to be okay with it. Unnerved but okay. I'm just glad my sister is  still away. I don't know how she'd handle it," Nariko admitted leaning on  the other girl as they turned left at an intersection. "What about your  parents?"</p><p>"My  father's clueless. He wouldn't understand anyway, and my mother's an  agent."</p><p>"Oh,  and what does she think of me?"</p><p>"That's  what I'm about to find out," The redhead sighed as she knocked on a door.</p><p>"Come  in," an older female voice said. Major Saotome then looked at the two  girls in the hallway. One was her son the other...</p><p>"Is  this my granddaughter?" the agent asked, her tone becoming somewhat  puzzled at the last word.</p><p>"Yes.  Nariko Saotome, this is my mother Nodoka Saotome," Ranma introduced.</p><p>"Saotome?"  Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Well,  she is my daughter," the redhead shrugged. "I'm going to ask Jacob if  he can change her name again."</p><p>Nodoka  looked over the demon girl. She had been cleared by Command and turned by her  son. It was strange, but what part of her life was not? She then smiled.  "It's a pleasure to meet you. Please come in. I apologize for the mess,  but I just moved in," Nodoka then turned to see a woman bounding over to  her.<br/>"Grandma!" Nariko  shouted with glee as she hugged the lab-coated woman.</p><p>Ranma  smiled, amused that this time she was not on the receiving end.</p><p>The  older woman returned the girl's embrace. The girl seemed so eager and  affectionate.</p><p>Ranma  looked around the lab. Smaller than the one her mother had in WIC Japan, the  room was filled with crates and boxes. Some of them were open, their contents  stacked on the counters and floor. "You got your transfer?"</p><p>"Yes,  I wanted to be closer to my family," Nodoka said as her eyes fell on her  granddaughter.</p><p>"Nariko-chan  was born a boy named Tatewaki Kuno. He had a thing for Sunshine and  Akane." Ranma explained as she told her mother how she had gotten a  daughter.</p><p>"I  wanted both of them," a blushing Nariko interrupted.</p><p>Three  generations of Saotome women were in the commissary eating a light snack. At  least Nodoka's portions were light. Ranma's were slightly larger - and Nariko  had already surpassed both.</p><p>"She's  been doing this for a while now," Ranma said after chastising her daughter  for eating too fast. Normally, she would not care, but she wanted Nariko to  have some restraint in front of her grandmother.</p><p>"She's  a growing girl," Nodoka said with amusement. <i>This was perfectly natural for young demons.  They grow rather fast in the first few months,  </i>the agent thought to herself.</p><p>"Sorry,"  Nariko said after taking a drink of water.</p><p>"Excuse  me," a female Company agent said as she walked up to their table.</p><p>Ranma  tuned to look at the woman. It was the communications agent who was in the  mobile command center.</p><p>"Miss  Nariko, your father is here," Maya Iverson stated.</p><p>"I  guess I should be going then," Nariko said sadly.</p><p>Ranma  looked at the girl's expression and sighed "I'll call you when I get back.  Okay?"</p><p>Nariko's  face brightened. She then turned and followed agent Iverson out the commissary.</p><p>"So  what do you think?" Ranma asked once Nariko had left the room.</p><p>"I'm  very proud of you. You had a very tough decision, but you made the right  choice."</p><p>Nodoka's  daughter nodded.</p><p>"Just  remember being a parent is a lot of responsibility. She may look like a  teenager, but she's really very young."</p><p>"I  know," Ranma said. "I'm not sure what I've gotten into, but I  couldn't ignore her. God, all she wanted was some affection from the person  that created her, but I was too repulsed by what I had done to treat her like a  person." Ranma's head was down and she could feel her eyes beginning to  tear up. She had kept her emotions in check for so long, only to lose control  now.</p><p>Nodoka  put her hand on her child's shoulder. "What's important is that you came  around now, and you're giving her the love she needs. The worst thing that can  be done to a child is to take away her parent. That's what I did to you. I'm  sorry."</p><p>"It's  okay," Ranma said, returning the gesture to her mother.</p><p>"I  did everything I could to try and find you. It just took so long," Nodoka  confessed.</p><p>The redhead slid herself closer to  her mother and hugged the woman. "I know mom. I know you're trying your  best."</p><p>Nodoka  returned the hug and smiled slightly. "I think your own daughter knows  that you're doing the same."</p><p>"I  don't remember there ever being Constellation Senshi," Luna said from her  perch on the kitchen table. Three girls and two moon cats were having a meeting  to discuss what Ami had seen.</p><p>"You  didn't remember DarkStar either," Usagi countered.</p><p>"What  did you do after the fight?" Minako asked Ami.</p><p>"Well  Janet looked at her watch and ran off."</p><p>"Does  she know who you are?" Artemis asked.</p><p>"I  didn't tell her my name, but I was the only one missing and I picked up my book  bag."</p><p>"There's  also the hair color," Ami idly remarked.</p><p>"Makoto  and Rei are going to wish they hadn't gone to the video store," Usagi  commented, referring to the two absent senshi.</p><p>"So  what should we do?"</p><p>"I  scanned her. The results were very close to a Sailor Senshi signature."</p><p>"So  she's a new Senshi? Wouldn't be the first we've met in Canada," Minako  stated.</p><p>"And  she seems to be more of a Sailor Senshi than this DarkStar," Luna noted.</p><p>"We  should ask Pluto about Senshi of constellations and then talk to Janet  herself," Usagi said.</p><p>Akane  was taking her after school jog. Her mind was mulling over today's events. She  had seen her sister's fiancee hugging that new girl Nariko. At first she  thought that Ranma had a girlfriend and was into some sort of weird lesbian  sex. Further inspection showed that the body language was wrong for a romantic  embrace.</p><p>It  was more like the two girls were sisters, or at least very close friends. Upon  further reflection the girl found something wrong with her assumption. There  was something about how the redhead had been talking to the other girl,  something that Akane felt should have been obvious.</p><p>Asking  Ranma proved to be no help. The redhead stated that they were close friends and  dismissed all further inquiries. Frustrated, Akane went jogging. Initially, it  was successful at preventing her from obsessing over it, but then Akane had an  epiphany.</p><p>The  reason she did not recognize Ranma's stature and tone initially was because of  how absurd it was. The conversation Akane overhead was like that between a  parent and child. It did not make sense. Granted a person could take a  protective stance over a friend, but what Ranma had been doing was eerie.</p><p>This  realization only spawned new questions. These were much more urgent than the  initial one. What did she really know about Ranma? Why didn't the curse bother  Kasumi? Why did Kasumi keep taking Ranma with her to work?</p><p>Akane  pondered, but was not able to solve anything. There was a missing piece. Her  thoughts were interrupted by what felt like an insect biting her left hip. She  slapped the spot and continued running.</p><p>After  a couple more paces, the girl's legs began feeling numb. Her left foot then  failed to land properly, and she tumbled off the shoulder and into the drainage  ditch that ran next to the road.</p><p>The  driver in a passing green van saw the body, pulled over, and stopped. What  looked like a pair of good Samaritans got out of the vehicle, checked to make  sure that the girl was alive, and then placed a quick call using a cell phone.  After carefully loading the girl into the back of the van, they drove off.</p><p>In  the suburb of Vaughan off exit thirty-four of Canadian Highway 400 was a small  light industrial park that had recently come under new ownership. Parked inside  one of the small warehouses in the lot was a green van.</p><p>The  warehouse was deserted. After parking the two people in the van carried their  package into an adjacent building. What had originally been the office space  for a custom machine shop had been redecorated in manner Spartan, yet plush. It  looked like someone with fine taste was building up their furnishings in  stages.</p><p>"Mistress,  we have her," the van's driver called out while gently placing the teenage  girl on the room's thick burgundy carpeting. She immediately averted her gaze  from the woman standing before her.</p><p>"Excellent,  you have done well, Laura," Mistress Alexia said after she confirmed that  the stock was not unduly damaged. With mid-back length curly blonde hair, dark  green eyes, tanned skin, and an erotically proportioned six foot tall body, the  woman looked imposing, sexy, and very, very cold. This was accentuated by her  long blood-red nails, her leather ankle-high, five-inch-heeled boots, her  pieces of gold and ivory jewelry, and her green-trimmed black leather dress.  The garment was low cut and hung from a pair of shoulder straps, and was  secured down the front center by a series of small gold buckles.</p><p>She  knelt down and removed all of the girl's clothing. Alexia swung one of her legs  over the girl's body so that she straddled the unconscious teen. The blonde  then smirked as her canines elongated and her eyes began to glow. Alexia's  teeth pierced the teenager's neck. She summoned her power and started to remake  the teenager.</p><p>"So  you're all Senshi?" Sailor Orion asked the five girls seated in front of  her. The six teenage girls were in the living room of the apartment the inner  Senshi shared.</p><p>"Yes,"  Sailor Moon responded.</p><p>"Thank  God I'm not alone," Orion sighed. "We're all stellar or astronomical  objects, interesting. Are there more of you?"</p><p>"Yes  there's a few more of us back in Japan," Moon stated.</p><p>"Any  of them named after constellations?"</p><p>"None  that we know of," Mercury replied. "So you don't know any other  Senshi?"</p><p>"Nope,  you're the first I've met."</p><p>"So  how'd you get your powers, Janet?" Venus inquired.</p><p>"A  couple months ago, I had a weird dream. In it a man wearing old fashioned  hunting clothes asked if I would be his avatar. I said yes. When I woke up I  found this under my pillow," Orion said patting her double bladed staff.  "Of course it wasn't this big then," the auburn-haired girl laughed.</p><p>"I  guess we can change back," Mars said.</p><p>Orion  shrugged and powered down. Her weapon shrank back down to a silver and gold  hunting knife. "Damn, that's still cool," Janet laughed.</p><p>After  transforming out of Senshi form, Usagi looked over the girl. Earlier, she had  called up Pluto and asked her what she knew of Sailor Senshi of Constellations,  specifically of Orion. Setsuna's voice had strained briefly. The green-haired  woman then told Usagi everything she knew about them.</p><p>During  the Silver Millennium a group of mages working at Serenity's request researched  the possibility of expanding the number of Sailor Senshi. Several methods were  looked into: bonding candidates to the other moons in the system, linking  candidates to elemental sources, having more than one Senshi to a planet, and  tapping into the energy that the Constellations represented.</p><p>Setsuna  recalled that the group had made little progress. Their work was all in the  theoretical stage. They were only just starting to test mockup spells and  modeling when the Silver Millennium fell. The time guardian then said that if  Ami's computer gave her a positive match then she probably was a Senshi, but  that it was best to be cautious.</p><p>"This  is definitely Silver Millennium," Luna said as she looked over Janet's  knife. "Don't normally see this type of transformation item though."</p><p>"I  still can't get over the cats," Janet noted. "You guys really are a  troop of magical girls."</p><p>Usagi  sighed. She would have liked to have Pluto look over the girl, but apparently  Setsuna had urgent business. There was a fresh lead with Murdock that the older  woman was investigating.</p><p>The  blonde woman looked into Janet's green-grey eyes and made her decision. Sailor  Orion had already proven herself in the store today, and now was not the time  to keep prospective members out. Especially considering a demonic nearly Sailor  Senshi who simply refused to join their team.</p><p>"Welcome  aboard," Usagi finally said.</p><p>"What  will you have me do, mistress?" a newly created demoness eagerly asked her  mother. Naked, she had a pair of dark blue horns, a black tail with blue fins,  and a pair of wings with blue-black membranes. The rest of her body was  remarkably similar to a certain human female. If her demonic extras were  removed she would be nearly identical to that girl. It was the eyes where the  difference was; they were still brown but something was not quite right about  their shape and pattern.</p><p>"Patience  my child," Alexia said, with a cold smile. "I think I'll call you  Eclipse," the blonde said as she stroked her chin.</p><p>The  demoness smiled at her new name and bowed to her mistress.</p><p>"I  have a mission for you," Alexia said as she strummed her fingernails on the  armrest of the couch she was sitting on. "Inside you are the memories of a  little piece of meat."</p><p>Eclipse  nodded. She felt the experiences of a weak, pitiful human inside of her.</p><p>"These  memories will help you kill a traitor," Alexia said before she described  DarkStar.</p><p>The  young demoness' face hardened. To her mind there was no greater sin than  betraying her mistress, her mother.</p><p>"You  will assume a human looking form, go to this girl's house, and pose as her. Do  not arouse suspicion. Once the traitor has fallen asleep you will go into her  room and kill her. She normally sleeps in the guise of a male human so it  should be very simple," Alexia said.</p><p>"As  you wish," the young demoness replied as she bowed again.</p><p>"For  your reward you may eliminate the other humans in the house."</p><p>"Thank  you," Eclipse stated, her eyes looking adoringly at her mistress.</p><p>"Get  dressed. Laura shall drop you off."</p><p>Eclipse  nodded. After making her demonic appendages disappear, she grudgingly donned in  Akane's clothing. She would suffer the indignity of wearing the dead girl's  clothing to serve Mother's will.</p><p>"So  where's Mommy?" Nariko asked the Company agent.</p><p>Kasumi  looked at Ranma's progeny and sighed. The two young women were in the kitchen  of the Tendo house. Her father and Genma were out, most likely drinking.  Nabiki's car was also gone. Akane was either out with Nabiki or jogging. Given  that Akane's running shoes were missing from the shoe rack next to the front  door, Kasumi guessed the latter.</p><p>The  lieutenant then turned back to the demoness. She really hated babysitting  assignments, especially the ones that literally involved watching some kid.  "Ranma's still at the base. I believe he's in a meeting with the  colonel."</p><p>"Ahh,  so she's going to be here soon?"</p><p>"Yes,  she should be coming home soon. Major Saotome is coming too."</p><p>"Yay!  Mommy's coming soon!" Nariko practically squealed. "And Grandma's  going to be here too!"</p><p>Kasumi  smiled despite herself. It was hard to stay cold in the face of a girl who was  so exuberant at the simple prospect of seeing her parent. The agent wondered if  Ranma had any idea of the kind of commitment he had made. She imagined that he  did, given that Nariko was essentially moving in with them.</p><p>Her  thoughts were interrupted by the front door being unlocked and opened. Kasumi  walked over and saw her youngest sister entering the house. The agent evaluated  the girl and found a few things amiss. Her clothes were stained and ripped in a  few places yet her top was still tucked into her running shorts. The girl's  gaze was also off somehow. Lt. Tendo knew that something was wrong and kept her  guard up.</p><p>"Oh  dear, did you trip?" Kasumi inquired.</p><p>"Yes.  I did... Kasumi," the blue-black haired teenager replied in a distant  voice.</p><p>"You  hit your head?" A concussion could explain this behavior.</p><p>The  younger sister nodded as she walked into the house.</p><p>"Let  me look at your injury," Kasumi proposed as she approached the girl.</p><p>"No,  I'm okay. It's just a little bump," the girl backpedaled.</p><p>"Okay,  maybe you should sit down for a bit," Kasumi said carefully examining the  girl. She then closed the front door.</p><p>"What  are you doing?" the younger woman asked in a panicky voice.</p><p>"Just  checking to make sure you're not badly cut or bruised," the agent stated,  looking at the girl. Concern was evident on her face.  Less obvious was whether it resulted from her  sister's injury or her sister's behavior.</p><p>"Oh,  it's Ranma's friend," the girl noted looking between her sister and the  other girl. Her expression became confused. Akane's memories did not say that  the traitor had any demonesses with her, but that human's memories also missed  that there was a demon living with her in the first place.</p><p>Kasumi  turned to look at Nariko. The girl's confused expression that made the agent  even more wary.</p><p>"Did  Mommy turn you too?" Nariko asked the younger girl. "It doesn't smell  like it was her," the demoness commented, curiously.</p><p>"What?"  Eclipse asked with confusion. Mistress had said this would be easy.</p><p>For  the Company agent, it became all too clear. Training took over as she drew her  weapon, cocked the hammer, and aimed it at the girl who was wearing her  sister's skin.</p><p>"Kasumi,  what are you doing?" Eclipse asked, trying to keep her tone innocent. This  was her largest mistake. If the real Akane had suddenly found her sister  holding her at gunpoint this would not have been her reaction.</p><p>"Get  down on the floor. Hands behind your head!" Kasumi ordered.</p><p>As  Eclipse started to kneel down, she began to think. If she could kill both the  human and the traitor's spawn and hide the bodies, then the plan would be  salvageable. When she was crouching, Eclipse sprung forward at the human and  manifested her true form.</p><p>Kasumi's  eyes narrowed. She ignored the wings that had torn out of the creature's back  and the tail that had popped out of her shorts. The woman even overlooked the  horns, fangs, and glowing eyes that appeared on her sister's face. The agent  simply acquired her target and depressed the trigger.</p><p>The  silver jacketed slug hit Eclipse in the top of her right shoulder. The angle  allowed for the projectile to travel through several of the demon's internal  organs.   The young demoness yowled in  pain as she tumbled from her planned trajectory.</p><p>Kasumi  swiveled to avoid the creature and fired another round into the demon's chest.  Eclipse fell to the ground. Raw hatred filled her face as she looked up at the  human who had done this to her.</p><p>It  took all of the agent's training to keep her hand from shaking. "Stay  down," she ordered to the demon.</p><p>Eclipse  flared her eyes and tried to charge forward.</p><p>Kasumi  uttered a noise that was halfway between a sigh and a sob and placed another  round into what used to be her sister. She noted that the monster was bleeding  heavily, but still breathing, for now.</p><p>Eclipse  cried. She had failed her mistress. She was worthless. She deserved to die this  way, gunned down by a mere human.</p><p>Kasumi  adjusted the aim of her weapon. It would be easy to end it. One more pull and  she could destroy this mockery of her sister and end Akane's suffering right  now. It was then that the agent looked over at Nariko. "Will you save my  sister?" Kasumi asked. She knew full well what that meant.</p><p>Nariko  looked at the broken demoness. She remembered the feelings she had for Akane.  Since her conversion, she had neglected them. Her mistress had taken all of her  affection. However, with Sunshine as her mother now, Nariko still needed a  mate. The red-eyed girl knelt over the other demoness.</p><p>Eclipse  tried to fight the intruder, but she was too weak. She then felt the other's  teeth sink into her neck and her essence mingling with hers. It was then that  the mortally wounded demoness lost consciousness.</p><p>Nariko  hoped that she was strong enough to do this. Not only would she have to bond  Akane to herself, and by extension Mother, but she also had to heal the girl's  wounds. While healing was only a side effect of the bonding procedure, and in  the case of humans the conversion process, it still took power.</p><p>Kasumi  looked away slightly. She then pulled out her cell phone and hit the speed dial  for WIC Toronto. She explained the situation and then called in a medical team  and a strike team.</p><p>"So  your... daughter's going to live with you?" Nodoka asked her child as they  wandered the corridors of WIC Toronto-A. After Nariko had left, Ranma had  stayed to talk with her mother. Given the subject they were discussing, her son  felt more comfortable in female form. Nodoka fully understood this.</p><p>"Yes.  We'll tell them that she got in trouble with her uncle Drake and that he kicked  her out. Given that she just transferred here and I'm an old friend..."</p><p>"Ahh,  I see. What will your father think of this?"</p><p>"He  can be convinced to look the other way," Ranma said, smirking. Whether Genma  admitted it or not, he was afraid of his son's new cursed form and would try to  avoid confrontation when Ranma was a girl. That was another factor that had  made the Sunshine thing all the more irritable. Especially given that she could  almost start to stand that name.</p><p>"And  Lieutenant Tendo can talk to her father," Nodoka surmised.</p><p>"Exactly.  Now my only problem is-"</p><p>The  redhead was then cut off by the public address system activating. "Major  Saotome and Ranma Saotome are requested in medical lab one. Medical emergency.  Incoming wounded," the inappropriately pleasant voice of that Company  dispatcher stated.</p><p>The  two Saotome women ran to the nearest stairwell and went up the two floors to  the level where the medical laboratories were. As the entered the corridor,  they glimpsed a medical team rushing two gurneys into one of the rooms.</p><p>"Dear  god," Nodoka gasped after she had gotten a clear view of the two  unconscious people being moved from the gurneys to a pair of beds in the  medical room.</p><p>"What  the hell happened?" the redhead asked. On one of the beds was a familiar  demoness. She had black violet-highlighted hair, red eyes, little red horns,  black violet-tipped wings, and a violet tail with black fins.</p><p>The  other demoness was somewhat new to Ranma. This one had, light blue hair with  silver highlights, brown eyes, dark blue horns, blue and white wings, and a  white tail with blue fins. Her face however was very known to the redheaded  demoness. There was also something strange about her form. It was a familiarity  that she could not quite grasp.</p><p>"Nariko  turned Akane," Ranma observed flatly. "What the hell happened?"  the redhead repeated.</p><p>Lt.  Tendo cleared her throat and began to speak. "I was alone in my residence  with Nariko. Akane then came home. Her speech and movements were most unusual.  She then panicked and manifested, revealing that she had been turned into a  demon. She then attacked me."</p><p>The  agent paused, then continued. "I defended myself. I shot her three times.  I then asked Nariko to heal her."</p><p>The  redhead blinked in disbelief. Someone had turned Akane and sent her back to her  house. "That's horrible." She now understood why Kasumi had reacted  that way when they first met. An unfamiliar demon was a very dangerous thing,  especially if she was once a family member.</p><p>"Yes,"  Kasumi stated.</p><p>"What  do we do with her?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"If  Nariko converted her, there may be a chance," Kasumi proposed. She then  looked to see Section Chief Tofu run into the room.</p><p>"Okay,  one's a rather immature D4. She's healthy, but rather drained," Tofu said  as he looked over the scans of Nariko.</p><p>Ranma  smiled a bit with pride despite herself. Her daughter had gone up two classes.</p><p>The  doctor then started examining the other girl. "Almost newborn D1. She  looks like-" He stopped when he examined the readout from his  scanner.  "Incomplete conversion!  She's unstable. We're gonna lose her," the doctor stated, in a detached  voice after his initial shock..</p><p>The  redhead sighed.  Her daughter had tried,  but she was not strong enough to both heal Akane and break the bond to her  original parent.  Ranma  could not let Kasumi's and Nariko's efforts  go to waste.</p><p>The  redhead walked over to the younger Tendo sister's form. She then leaned over  and completed the work her daughter had started. It did not take much  time.  This would be the second time she  had done this procedure, and now she was only finishing up.</p><p>Kasumi's  eyes narrowed.  She kept her hand at her  side.  This made a total of three  demoness at Akane's neck today, but this was the only option.</p><p>Nodoka  froze.  She knew that her son had the  body of a demoness, but until now she had been acting as if her son simply  turned into a girl.  Now she had to face  up to the truth. Her child was not human. She had a demoness for a daughter.</p><p>When  it was over, the forensic pathologist examined the blue-haired demoness.  "That should do it," he said, indicating that the girl was now  healthy.</p><p>"Akane?  Momma?" Nariko muttered as she began to wake up.</p><p>"Yes?"  Nariko's mother asked, going to her daughter's side.</p><p>"I  saved her," Nariko said, smiling at her mother.</p><p>"Yes  you did.  I only had to help a little  bit."</p><p>"She's  now one of us," the younger demoness said. Her eyes were now alert, and  she was alternating between gazing lovingly at her mother and her mate.</p><p>If  the redhead could have gotten any paler she would have. The consequences of  what had just happened had finally hit her. "I've got another  daughter," Sunshine realized with a mix of horror and euphoria.</p><p>"Can  I speak to you outside?" Kasumi asked Ranma, startling the redhead.</p><p>"Sure."  The two young women then stepped out of the room and into the hallway. After  the door closed Ranma sat down on one of the benches that were next to the  wall. Kasumi sat down next to the redheaded demoness. She unholstered her  handgun, dropped the magazine, ejected the chambered round, and started working  the slide. "You know why I let Nariko do that? You have to. I couldn't let  my sister die. Fuck. I never thought my life with the Company would come to my  family," she rambled as she field stripped the weapon. The pieces went  into a small pile on the table that was next to the bench.</p><p>"Akane's  now bonded to you and Nariko," Kasumi observed as she reassembled the  pieces without looking at them. "She's now your responsibility. You <i>will</i> help her recover. You won't neglect  her." the agent stated staring into the redhead's eyes. "Am I being  clear?"</p><p>Ranma  stared at Kasumi for a moment, and then her eyes narrowed.</p><p>Kasumi's  breath caught in her throat as Ranma's hand blurred toward her, and she felt a  sinking feeling in her stomach as the newly reassembled gun clattered on the  floor in front of her.</p><p>"Shut  up," Ranma mumbled. "Shut up now." The redhead's eyes remained  hard. "Don't you dare talk down to me like I'm some goddamn agent under  your command."</p><p>The  agent's face remained expressionless, though her hands twitched slightly from  the stinging sensation of having the gun slapped away.</p><p>"I  know you've just been through a lot of crap. I know it hurts. I know that for  all you act like a robot, you're not going to stand there and shoot your sister  in the head, all right!" Ranma grit her teeth as Kasumi's face continued  to stare straight at her, unflinching.</p><p>"Yes,  I'll help her recover. No, I won't neglect her. I'll be responsible for  her." Ranma's eyes hardened again. "But you keep in mind that YOU  asked Nariko to do that, not me, and that I don't take orders from you. Am I  being clear?"</p><p>Kasumi  continued to look at her fiance.  She  reached down, picked up her gun, and holstered it. "Crystal," Kasumi  replied with a hint of a smile.</p><p>"Dear  God. That better <i>not</i> have been a  fucking test!"</p><p>"I  was concerned about Akane," Kasumi replied, simply.</p><p>"She's  my daughter now. Since I finally understand and... accept what that means, I know  what I've got to do. I won't screw up again." Though the young mother felt  insulted by what Kasumi had done, she felt both it and her defense were  justified.</p><p>"Good,  I'm very concerned about her. You know how delicate these things can be,"  Kasumi then said.</p><p>The  redhead then put her hand around the agent's waist. The older girl stiffened at  first, but she then relaxed. "Its okay Kasumi. If you hadn't thought to  use Nariko, we'd be arranging a funeral."</p><p>"Just  don't fuck this up. It's too important." Kasumi said as she closed her  eyes, trying to hold back her emotions.</p><p>The  redhead nodded. The guilt over what she had done to Nariko weighed on her mind,  and now there was this. It was too much. "I promise," she said, attempting  to hold back her own tears. It did not last. The demoness started to sob.</p><p>Kasumi  smiled and held the other girl. After a minute, the lieutenant looked into the  redhead's blue and violet eyes. This demon... this girl... her fiancee had very  human emotions and motivations. It looked like Akane had some hope after all,  and for just a moment, Kasumi almost wished their engagement was more than just  a charade.</p><p>The  demoness stared back. "Come on, let's go inside," Sunshine smiled  through her drying tears as she stood up.</p><p>Kasumi  nodded and followed the other girl into the room.</p><p>A  blue-haired demoness opened her eyes to an unfamiliar room. It was very drab  and grey. More importantly were the people in the room. She smiled at tallish  black-haired demon that stood next to her bed. She then leaned up and kissed  her mate on the lips. Nariko immediately responded and leaned into the girl's  embrace. Soon the two demonesses were in the bed, tangled into each other.</p><p>Ranma  sighed. Part of her felt uncomfortable at this. Another part felt very lonely.  She almost wanted to lean over and kiss Kasumi herself. The agent was her  fiancee after all. "After you two finish, I have a few questions."</p><p>Nariko  broke away from her mate and looked at the redhead sheepishly. "Sorry Mommy."</p><p>"Mommy?"  the blue demoness asked. Yes, that was her mommy.</p><p>"Yes,  she's our mommy." Nariko smiled.</p><p>The  redhead then walked over to the youngest demoness and stroked her hair. On a  whim, she then kissed the blue-haired girl on the forehead. "So what  happened? Do you remember who you are?"</p><p>"I  was Akane Tendo, but then I was taken. My old mother made me into  Eclipse," the blue-haired demoness said with a mix of revulsion and  pleasure. Akane then closed her eyes and sighed. "She then sent me to...  to... kill you. All of you," she added sadly. "But then Nariko saved  me. She broke me free from my mother- no- from Alexia. You saved me too,"  the blue haired demoness said, as she looked at her mother's face.</p><p>"It's  okay. You couldn't control yourself," Sunshine said to her daughter. She  then turned to her other daughter. "You did good Nori-chan. Akane's alive  because you saved her."</p><p>"I'm  happy that you're back," Kasumi smiled at her sister.</p><p>"Thanks  Auntie Kasumi," Akane beamed before she kissed Nariko again.</p><p>Kasumi  sighed. Her sister still needed a lot of help.</p><p>"You  have my word: Akane will have all the love she needs to recover.  Unlike..." Sunshine as unable to finish the sentence.</p><p>Nariko  looked at her mother. "Stop beating yourself up, Mama. I... I... was an  ass before..."</p><p>"I  know. I thought only of that. I could only see you as a horny transsexual  trying to get into my panties. Not as my child who only wanted love from  me."</p><p>"But  with Akane-chan we'll get it right, right Momma?" Nariko asked.</p><p>Sunshine  looked at Nariko and smiled despite herself. She felt a powerful urge and went  with it. She grabbed both of her daughters and held them tight. "We'll try  girls. Kasumi, Mom, will you help us?"</p><p>"Of  course," Kasumi said smiling, at her fiance.</p><p>"You  didn't need to ask.  I would be honored  to help my daughter heal my granddaughter," Nodoka replied.  For the Company agent, the words were still  strange to speak, but they felt so right.</p><p>"Sorry  to interrupt, but I'd just like to tell you that, both of your children are  healthy," Section Chief Tofu said after  checking the sensor readouts.</p><p>"Great,"  Sunshine smiled. At least her children were physically healthy.</p><p>"Well,  I'll leave you alone then," Tofu stated before leaving the room.</p><p>Akane  leaned back in her bed and yawned.</p><p>"You  sleepy?" Nariko asked her mate.</p><p>Akane  nodded.</p><p>"We  should leave then," Nodoka said tapping on Kasumi's elbow. "Come on Lieutenant."</p><p>Kasumi  looked at her sister before following the major out of the room. Akane needed  some time alone with her... mother.</p><p>Sunshine  looked at her sleepy daughter. "Scoot over," she then said as she  slipped into bed with Akane. The blue haired girl complied. Sunshine then  looked disapprovingly at Akane's clothing. Her jogging suit was ripped in the  back and covered in blood. "Take those off."</p><p>Akane  happily slipped out of the trappings of her old life. Being naked in front of  her mother did not feel odd in the slightest.</p><p>"Come  on in," Sunshine then said to her other daughter.</p><p>Nariko  looked at the empty space by her mother's left side. It would be a tight fit,  but she did not mind. She then climbed into the bed and snuggled next to her  mother. Sunshine's form then shimmered and she became naked. The  three demonesses laid there, blanketing each other with mutual reassurance.</p><p>Somehow,  Sunshine knew sleeping as a family would help... and the waves of warmth and  love from her children told her why.</p><p>"This  is an interesting turn of events," Jacob commented as he watched the live  feed from the medical room. As usual, the two senior agents were meeting in  Stillwater's office.</p><p>"Have  we found any information on the demoness that turned Miss Tendo?"  Commander Stillwater inquired.</p><p>"Just  a name: Alexia. We also have teams searching the area where she was captured.  We might get lucky," Jacob shrugged.</p><p>"This  does not bode well."</p><p>"We  should have expected them to try hitting Ranma close to home. At least they'll  be safe for now."</p><p>"This  demonic brood is of some concern to me," Stillwater said, looking at the  monitor.</p><p>"I  disagree. I think it's the best thing that could have happened to Ranma. Before,  he had nothing to anchor him. He was divided between his humanity and the demon  within. Now <i>she</i> has responsibilities  and a family that loves <i>her</i> and  trusts <i>her</i>," Jacob countered,  emphasizing the pronouns in the last sentence.</p><p>"Provided  that she can bear the responsibility."</p><p>"Yes,  that is a given.  However, we do have  excellent support in place. Major Saotome and Lieutenant Tendo will be  invaluable."</p><p>Stillwater  nodded in consideration.</p><p>"Now  please turn off that monitor. Give them some privacy. You can always review the  archives later," Jacob stated respectfully. Those three demonesses might  not have a problem with nudity, but the agent still had his sense of decency.  Given some of the things he had done for the  Company, it was a strange for him to have a sense of modesty like that, but  Jacob held onto what he could.</p><p>Sunshine could not believe how  quickly all her apprehensions and doubts melted away as she lay between her two  children. She even knew that the Company was watching them, but she did not  care. For once she had nothing to hide. Given her state of undress, her  thoughts had a more literal meaning as well.</p><p>Each of her daughters slept with an  arm under their mom, and another loosely draped over, as if sharing something  valuable. The two girls had weathered a lot today, but their mother's  presence... her presence... had helped both sleep soundly at last. As she  drifted off to sleep, content, she wondered what her life in the future would  be. And what choices she would make.</p><p>Her last conscious thoughts were of  Akane... and her new child's fate. Would she be like Nariko? Or... would she be  able to help the new demon back to being Akane, or as close as she could be  considering her daughter's new body, and its needs?</p><p>Ranma looked over at Kasumi. It was  easier to gaze at his wife than look through the glass. Only a few years had  passed since he had come to the toughest decision of his life.  "Sunshine" was just a memory now, still brought to life in cold  water, but he did not surrender his soul to the demon. And the Enclosure was  the cost of his personal victory. The Company was willing to maintain the room,  and that too had its price. Swallowing, his gaze returned to the two residents  of the glassed-in area.</p><p>Food had just been dropped off, so  the demons were eating. Though both had regressed to a near feral state since  Ranma had freed his mind and soul from DarkStar, the two demonesses had matured  and certainly looked content. What remained of their humanity could be seen in  their grooming, or perhaps it was natural for demonesses to groom themselves  too.</p><p>The silvery-blue haired demon who  had been Akane blinked for a second, and then looked up to the glass that  allowed the humans to see into her world. She spoke only one word,  "Mommy."</p><p>Ranma and Kasumi both read the  girl's lips from above. Ranma closed his violet eyes. Akane was not there in  the darkness. Her tears were not falling. He could not see her. He had done  what he had to do. He had been saved. The schools had been joined, even if by a  marriage of scant love.</p><p>He knew that when they got home  Kasumi would take out her handgun, <i>that</i>  handgun, and stare at it. He was certain that his wife was just remembering  that day, and that she was not planning anything... rash. Later they would go  out and have a nice quiet dinner.</p><p>He was happy.</p><p>He had to be.</p><p>The scene shifted.</p><p>Akane, dressed in the yellow gi she  favored, leapt into the air with a cry. Soun tried to dodge his daughter's  attack, but failed. Akane landed a solid blow to his chest after snaking around  the attempted dodge. Flipping, she landed softly on her feet, her long,  light-blue hair falling gently to her middle back.</p><p>"Good choice of attack, Akane.  The Saotome School is excellent in that situation," Genma shouted from the  edge of the mat.</p><p>"Yes, Daughter, well  done," Soun said as Akane hurtled towards him...</p><p>"Thanks Daddy," the girl  said as she hugged her father tightly. She had passed father's test. She had  proven herself.</p><p>Sunshine watched from a position  next to her own father, a proud smile on her face. She turned to Genma,  "So, Pop. Does this mean the schools are joined?"</p><p>"Yes, Boy... err... daughter. I  guess it does. "Genma said as he turned to face his child.</p><p>Sunshine held out two arms in an  offer of embrace.</p><p>Genma looked a bit sheepish, but  lightly encircled his daughter with his arms. Sunshine, never one for half  measures, squeezed her father hard for a few moments before letting go.  "Are those tears I see, Pop?"</p><p>"No, just some dust in my  eyes," Genma said as he looked away.</p><p>The sound of bare feet on flooring  interrupted Sunshine's thoughts as a yellow blur flew into her field of vision.  "We did it, Mom. We did it!"</p><p>Sunshine looked down into her  daughters eyes and saw intellect, happiness, but most of all... Akane.</p><p>Sunshine awoke to a pillow wet with  her own tears. Her children still enclosed her with warmth. She realized that  this was the choice she would make. No, this was the choice she had already  made. To stay Ranma, and true to himself, she had to become Sunshine and  embrace her life... and make it his.</p><p>Later,  Sunshine would reluctantly untangled herself from her children to visit the bathroom.  She glanced at the mirror while washing her hands. Though the reflected  demoness' eyes now were almost a quarter violet flecks, she was neither  surprised nor concerned.</p><p>"So  what happened to my newest toy?" Alexia demanded. She and her minions were  in their Vaughan hideout.</p><p>"I'm  sorry, but we lost contact with Eclipse," Laura stated as she bowed before  her mistress. "The observation team spotted a contingent of police and  military style vehicles on the property. They believe it was the Company. Since  night has not fallen, we suspect she has failed."</p><p>"So,  someone alerted the Company? Interesting. Any sign of her?"</p><p>"None.  We must assume that the Company has killed her," Laura replied.<br/>"Yes, that is how they  operate. But it is unusual for them to respond to a house where a demon has  been staying. Hmm, they also came very quick. Eclipse hadn't been there all of  a half hour. I wonder..."</p><p>Alexia's  smile widened. "Of course! DarkStar always had a soft spot for humans.  Very clever girl. So you've found another group of meat bags to defect to. I  wonder if she'll get all of these killed too."</p><p>Murdock  sat alone in the Red Turtle bar. "You believe in fate?" the runic  mage asked the bartender.</p><p>The  man behind the bar paused and looked at his customer. There was something  strange in the man's watery grey eyes, something repellant but enticing.  "Yeah, I guess I do. I mean there's got to be some reason for everything,  some point to all this."</p><p>"My  thoughts exactly. I can tell you that there is definitely <i>something</i> behind this," Murdock smiled before he took a sip of  his beer. "Of course then we get the question of fate and free will."</p><p>The  bartender nodded. His experience had taught him to let the customer do the  talking.</p><p>"Now,  anyone with knowledge of history would know how free will affects fate. History  is the consequences of the choices that individuals make. That's it - nothing  more. Now a person's choices are influenced by past decisions of others."</p><p>"So  what about fate?" the bartender asked after he returned from pouring a  drink for another customer.</p><p>"Fate,  destiny is the pattern that all these choices sum up to," Murdock chuckled  and looked into his opaque beer. "The thing people forget is that it's a  two way street. Yes, people are influenced by the choices of others and from  that destiny, but they often forget that destiny can also be changed by  individuals. Hell, look at whatever happens when someone dies," Murdock  said with a dark grin. He then sighed. "I can't believe that I forgot that  second part, and now I've lost her."</p><p>"Women  problems?" the bartender asked. Maybe it was that tall, tanned woman with  the nice green dye job. Sometimes she would sit with this customer. She was not  here tonight which was a bit odd.</p><p>Murdock  smirked. "Yeah, I guess it was that obvious. What with me getting all  maudlin, but I thought I could make it work. Hell, I'd gotten so close, but  it's too late for that."</p><p>The  bartender gave a sympathetic nod. He knew that now was definitely the wrong  time to ask for more information. It was much better to just let the man  talk... and drink.</p><p>"I  keep leading her along, and now my lies are catching up with me. I guess, I  went too far today. I thought that it would bring her to me. But I didn't take  into account everything. I got sloppy."</p><p>As  he refilled his customer's glass, the bartender suppressed a sigh. That made  sense; there was something of a flimflam man to him. Charming and smooth,  chicanery was undoubtedly this fellow's forte.</p><p>"All  I wanted was to be the man behind the woman behind the queen, and now I'm going  to pay for it. It's a damn good thing I have a backup plan."</p><p>[End  chapter 7]</p><p>Author's notes: Here it is the first chapter in the  Second Arc of The Return.</p><p>Many thanks go to Kevin D Hammel for spurring this  fic in a new direction and getting it out of its production slump. Also there  are a couple of scenes he had a direct hand in making. Mike Koos also gets  credit for getting me into contact with Kevin.</p><p>Prereading credit goes to Kevin D Hammel, Jerry  Starfire, Wray Loflin, Joe Fenton, Bill Heineman, and Black Dragon.</p>
