</div><p>The Return</p><p>A Ranma Sailor Moon fic thingy.</p><p>By Josh Temple</p><p>Naturally, I own neither Sailor Moon nor Ranma. So here's  the disclaimer</p><p>Ranma 1/2 and its characters and settings belong to Rumiko  Takahashi, Shogakukan, Kitty, and Viz  Video. Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon belongs to Naoko Takeuchi,  Koudansha, TV Asahi, and Toei Douga,  and DIC.</p><p>Previous chapters and other works can be found at my  website.</p><p>[go to the site listed as my webpage on my  main page  from there you can go to the site.</p><p>Chapter 6 Requirements and Reactivations</p><p>A  green-eyed young man with a shaggy mop of black hair sighed as he looked out the  window of his hotel room. Coincidently, the window faced the jagged concrete  and glass building of the Canada Trust   Tower. It had been a long journey  but he had arrived.</p><p>The enemy  was here. His thoughts of vengeance were carefully muted. There were other  dangers. Caution had to be taken, the foe had become stronger and more vile  than he had thought possible</p><p>Fortunately,  he had the experience and the abilities to prevail. He looked at his watch. His  partner should be returning shortly, that is if her ride was not delayed.</p><p>The UH-60L  version of the Black Hawk has an External Stores Support System. It consists of  a pair of removable "four-station pylons." These can carry weapons  pods or external fuel tanks. These tanks can extend the range of the Black Hawk  to 1,150 nautical miles.   Given a start  at the Company site to the south of Dalandzadgad,   Mongolia, this placed  nearly all of the Qinghai  province within an acceptable distance.</p><p>A pair of  low-flying helicopters crossed the Mongolian border and entered the People's  Republic of China.  Still before sunrise, the passage of the twin aircraft was only seen as a pair  of faded radar blips. The Chinese soldiers in that section had been given  specific orders. They were not questioned. The two echoes were allowed to enter  their country.</p><p>Inside one  of the helicopters, Jacob worried about what the Company had done to get such  access, but if they were going to try to cure Ranma, they had to go to  Jusenkyou. All he knew was that the helicopters were required to have the  Company logo affixed to their aft sides. Having obvious identification on  Operations vehicles was not a preferred tactic, but apparently the Chinese  Government insisted. Jacob was suspicious of this, but he had his orders.</p><p>Anything  else would eat away at the teen, causing his suspicion and paranoia to grow. There  were other ways to get him to Jusenkyou, but this was by far the fastest, and  time was very critical.</p><p>Jacob sighed  and leaned back, listening to the drone of the engines and the rotor blades. Dressed  in the standard operations armor, Jacob's goggles were pulled up onto his  helmet and the bottom of his balaclava was pulled below his chin. Most of the  other agents in the transport were dressed similarly. The pilot, co-pilot,  flight engineer, and the two gunners had their goggles pulled down and set to  lowlight enhancement.</p><p>Ranma was  looking out the darkened window. In three hours he would be there. The Company  was making good on its promise. He worried whether or not the pools would  actually cure him. He would find out soon enough.</p><p>"Arrival  in seven," the pilot of the lead helicopter said into his headset.</p><p>Ranma, who  still refused to wear a communications device, was told when Kasumi tapped his  arm. She then showed him her left hand. Her ring finger was tucked under her  thumb and her other fingers were extended. She then pointed to the door on the  side of the helicopter.</p><p>Ranma  nodded in understanding. For the last few minutes the rolling countryside has  started to look rather familiar. He was almost there.</p><p>By now the  pilot could see the landing zone. It was a roughly flat clearing. More  interestingly was the smallish valley to the east of the LZ. In the early  morning light, it looked picturesque, hundreds of small pools partially  shrouded in wisps of fog.</p><p>The agent  also knew what this place really was. It was an H-Type location. Those tiny  ponds of water possessed some sort of Pattern altering ability. The pilots were  under strict orders to not fly too close to them.</p><p>Their  scanners showed that the area was clear, although Jusenkyou itself was generating  some interference. The lead helicopter then nosed down to the LZ while the  other Black Hawk provided cover. Inside, the agents pulled down their goggles  and checked their weapons.</p><p>The gunners  watched the field as the helicopter neared the earth. When it was a couple of  feet above the ground, the Black Hawk stopped and hovered. Kasumi was the first  one off. She jumped over, ran forward several feet, and then took a prone  position. Five other agents, Kasumi's three plus two who were proficient in  Mandarin and Cantonese, exited and set up a perimeter.</p><p>Ranma then  jumped out followed by the Kuno girl. After walking a few feet, the powerful  down draft intensified before slowly reducing. Ranma turned to see the  helicopter lift off.</p><p>"Don't.  It's bad luck," the demon said as she looked at Ranma.</p><p>"Let's  go!" Kasumi ordered.</p><p>As Jacob watched  as the squad made its way to the rally point, he thanked the engineers behind the  Talent Keyhole programs. They were the ones that developed Corona,  the world's first overhead satellite imagery system.</p><p>Things had  advanced much since the early sixties. Back then, the satellites had Kodak  cameras that deorbited and returned to earth when they ran out of film. Now  essentially imagery was available to private businesses, although the Company  itself never bothered with such issues. As a think tank with several contracts  with the defense and intelligence sector, Willard International Consulting  enjoyed certain fringe benefits.</p><p>However,  Jacob did not rely solely on such reconnaissance. Procedure was to check the  area with scanners and visual reconnaissance before deploying ground troops. The  original Company survey of the area indicated that here were several unstable  and potentially violent factions at work in the immediate area.</p><p>Lieutenant  Tendo stopped at the ridgeline that overlooked the valley. She scanned the  target area. Finding it clear the agent gave her orders. Gabriel,   Aram, Sophie, and Shigeru,  one of the translators from WIC Japan, stayed behind to secure the ridgeline  while Kasumi, Ranma, Kuno, and Hyuga, the other translator, walked down the  slope into the valley itself.</p><p>Ranma  smirked. He had been cursed for nearly half a year, and now he would get rid of  it. The water in the Company had in storage did not work, but it was almost  thirty years old. Here it was fresh and still potent. Ranma looked at his  companions and sighed.</p><p>"You're  not coming all the way with me?"</p><p>"Personally,  I'd rather not," Kasumi stated as she looked at the pools.</p><p>"Then  why are you here?"</p><p>"Escort  and in case a translator is needed."</p><p>"I  told you the guide speaks Japanese."</p><p>"Doesn't  hurt to be prepared," Kasumi responded.</p><p>The warrior  watched as the two soldiers escorted a pair of teenagers into the cursed  valley. The uniforms were unfamiliar to her. She gave a quizzical glance to her  partner who shook her head in negation. Neither recognized any in the group.</p><p>Ever since  they heard the approaching aircraft, they had been wary. The two other members  of their patrol had run back to alert the village. Overflights were a rare  enough occurrence that they warranted observation.</p><p>They saw  the dark helicopter land and deposit a squad of soldiers. The grey symbols on  the side of the machine were quickly memorized. She watched the machine lift  back up into the air. The young woman then motioned to her partner that it was  time to go back to Jusenkyou.</p><p>What she  saw was quite familiar. One of the teenagers was talking to the valley's  caretaker while the girl and the two soldiers watched. After a brief  conversation the guide pointed to a specific pool. As the man lead the two  teens towards it, he kept warily glancing back at the two following soldiers.</p><p>The warrior  noted that they were maintaining their distance from the springs. She then  curiously watched as the two teens entered the Nannichuan.  The boy did it with great enthusiasm while the girl did it with some  reluctance.</p><p>The  reaction was particularly strange, especially for the spring-of-drowned-man. The  girl remained a girl, and the boy turned into a girl. She then watched as the  two teenaged girls exited the pool. The raven-haired girl simply shrugged. The  redhead's reaction was quite different.</p><p>The warrior  observed the crimson-tressed girl's rage rise. She also noticed that the girl's  clothing had changed. She was now wearing a very tight black leather dress. As  the Amazon watched the redhead angrily converse with the guide, she knew  something else was amiss. To start with, the girl looked oddly dry for someone  who had just been immersed in water.</p><p>When she  got a look at the furious redhead's eyes it became somewhat clearer. They were  burning with a bluish-violet light. She and her partner watched as the guide  had the two girls immerse themselves again.</p><p>There was  no effect. Something else became clearer to the warrior. They were not trying  to pick up a curse but instead trying to cure one, and it was not working. The  warrior knew that some creatures were immune to the effects of the waters. She  also knew that many of those creatures were not particularly kind to humans.</p><p>The  situation here was most strange. The girl hoped that the rest of her team would  return with reinforcements, and more importantly, orders about what exactly she  should do.</p><p>By the time  they arrived, the pair of strange teenage girls, the soldiers, and their  helicopters had left. Naturally, the Guide was interviewed, but his story,  while informative, did not answer any real questions.</p><p>On an  abandoned airstrip to the South of Dalandzadgad, Mongolia  was a WIC Field Command Base. A collection of rather ugly mobile buildings, the  facility provided housing and workspace for a couple dozen agents. The command  building was made from three interconnected boxes that had some resemblance to  shipping containers.</p><p>Inside the  building was a room that doubled as both mess hall and briefing room. Sulking  at one of the tables was Ranma Saotome. The martial artist was staring down at  the table in front of him.</p><p>Across from  him sat another teenage girl. "I'm sorry Mistress," she apologized in  a quiet voice.</p><p>"Dear  lord, now what did you do?" Ranma groaned.</p><p>Confusion  clouded the girl's face, "Nothing, you just seem unhappy that you're still  a demon."</p><p>"What?  You couldn't understand why I preferred to be human," Ranma stated.</p><p>"I  don't, but I know that you do want to be fully human," the young demoness  admitted. "And I'm sorry that you didn't get your wish."</p><p>"Oh,  thanks," Ranma replied looking up. Kuno was actually doing something nice,  and more importantly, normal. He decided to try some apologizing of his own.  "I know how hard it is. I've had to deal with being turned into a female  demon too. It's not permanent for me but - "</p><p>"If  you want, I can help cheer you up," the girl offered as she licked her  lips and leaned across the table.</p><p>" No!  You sick freak! Damn it!" Ranma cried as he pulled back in revulsion.  "I try to do one nice thing, and look what happens! Gahh!"  He then got up and left the room, nearly running into the Company agent that  was posted on the outside of the door.</p><p>The girl  looked down at the table and sighed.</p><p>Ami carried  the mostly empty laundry bag down the basement hallway. According to the fire  escape map, the apartment building's laundry room should be just a little  further down and to the left. The room was in the expected location. She opened  the door to find the lights on in the room and one of the washers in operation.</p><p>Sitting at  the table in the center of the drab basement room was one of her classmates. Ami  immediately recognized the Seifuku-clad girl who appeared to be doing homework.  She had dark auburn hair and greenish-grey eyes. "Hi, Janet," Ami cautiously  greeted as she entered the room. Ever since Usagi's brush with Murdock, they  had been slightly on edge.</p><p>"Oh  hi, Ami," Janet Fraiser said cheerily as she looked up from her work.  "You live here too? <i>And</i> you've already  run out of clothes?" she then asked with some surprised.</p><p>"Yeah,  I do," Ami said, she then looked at her diminutive cloth bag and sighed. "I  mean live here. Not that I'm out of clothes. One of my roommates spilled  something on a blouse she was borrowing, and I have to wash it before the stain  sets in." She said with some irritation. The other inner Senshi were her  friends,</p><p>but she wondered if  they could stand living with each other. Ami then went to one of the unused  washing machines and started to pretreat the stained blouse.</p><p>"Ahh,"  Janet stated in understanding.</p><p>"Why  are you down here? I mean you transferred the same day as I did," Ami  asked as she loaded the blouse and the rest of her dirty laundry into the  machine. She was going to have to do the wash anyway, might as well get some  other clothes clean as well.</p><p>"Simple,"  Janet replied as she wrote another line of equations in her notebook. "The  freight movers that my mother contracted lost our stuff," the girl said as  she shook her head. "We're stuck with what was in our carry on and stuff  we bought here. Hell, that's why I'm in this thing," Janet said, pointing  to the school girl uniform she was wearing.</p><p>"Oh,  that's a shame."</p><p>Janet  simply shrugged and drew a sketch to accompany the equations she had previously  written.</p><p>"What  are you doing? School's still closed," the sapphire-haired girl inquired  as she walked over to get a better look at what the other girl was doing. To  the Janet's left was a stack of three large textbooks. From her position Ami  read their spines. They were all from the Jane's series of technical and  military texts. The top one was a soft-cover and the thinnest. The middle and  bottom were hard cover and were twice and three times the thickness of the  uppermost.</p><p>The top was  titled "Jane's Military Training Systems 1990." The middle was  "Jane's All the World's Aircraft." And the bottom, a volume thicker  than a phonebook, was simply called "International Defense  Directory." Each had numerous Post-It notes bookmarking various pages.</p><p>To Janet's  right was a pair of large black three ring binders. Neatly labeled dividers  separated the reams of paper. The one on the top was open. The current page was  that of a Drag Coefficient Table.</p><p>Ami looked  at the books and then at Janet. From the couple of days of classes that they  had shared, Ami knew that the other girl was very strong in her math, science,  and surprisingly history, but somewhat weak in English. It was not that she was  incapable of doing the work. It was just that she did not seem to care about  the finer points of literature.</p><p>"It's just  a personal project," Janet said flipping to a previous page. She then  turned her notebook around so Ami could see it. The page was covered with  several neat and precise mechanical sketches. They appeared to be the  components to a helicopter of some kind. A miniature remote controlled one if  the scale on the drawings were right.</p><p>"Interesting,"  Ami said, looking over the diagrams.</p><p>"Yeah,  shame I can't build it for a while," Janet wistfully said. "I had to  leave most of my workshop back home in Cheyenne,  and what I did bring is lost with the rest of our stuff."</p><p>"That  is a shame," Ami agreed as she turned to another page.</p><p>"What  are you going to do?" Janet shrugged as she got up and checked her washing  machine. As she turned away and bent down to pick up her clothes and transfer it  to a dryer, Janet's jacket rode up slightly, exposing a weapon's tip.</p><p>However, this was missed by Ami. Her eyes were  on the readout of her recently activated Mercury computer. After confirming  that Janet was human, the blue-haired girl reflected on her paranoia. Was she  going to scan everyone that she met? Well, it was quite the coincidence that  they lived in the same apartment building, but Janet seemed just as surprised  as she was.</p><p>"When  do you think school's going to resume?" Janet asked after she had activated  the dryer.</p><p>"I  guess in a couple of days. It's not like those terrorists blew anything  up," Ami answered, carefully looking at the other girl. She remembered  that Janet was with them that day, as well as that Rod Ferris.</p><p>After Ranma  asked how much time was left before their flight landed in Toronto, he thought  about that second meeting he had with his mother. She seemed disappointed that  the water did not work, but not that surprised at it. There was also something  rather strange about the way she said goodbye to him.</p><p>Through the  window, Ranma looked questioningly at the noonday sky. Apparently it was almost  noon Eastern Standard time. He had  left on this trip at three PM two  days ago. By his estimation he had spent over twenty-eight hours in planes of  one kind or another, excluding the seven hours he had spent in that helicopter.  The rest of the time, some eleven hours, was spent waiting for his flights in  various Company facilities, and visiting his mother.</p><p>Looking at  his traveling companions, Ranma noticed that the Company agents were not  showing any signs of jet lag. He supposed that that was all a part of the  training they went under. It made sense given that the Company seemed to train  its agents to be prepared for just about any situation, and to reduce as many  of their human weaknesses as possible.</p><p>Remarkably,  Ranma felt fine as well. He supposed that it was due to his own sleep deprivation  training. He did not know enough about jet lag to be sure of this.</p><p>In under an  hour, the Company Learjet made contact with the Northern runway of Toronto's  Lester B. Pearson  International Airport.  It taxied and its passengers disembarked. Ranma went with Kasumi to the lot  where her sedan had been parked. As he left he saw the Kuno girl walking with  two of Kasumi's flunkies. Ranma assumed that they were taking her home too.</p><p>"Sorry  you didn't get cured," Kasumi said as she unlocked her car. She then  popped open the trunk and they both deposited their bags inside it.</p><p>"Like  you really care," Ranma responded after opening the passenger door.</p><p>"You  would be much happier without it," the Company agent simply stated while  she turned the car's ignition.</p><p>"Let  me guess, bad morale causes poor performance?" Ranma inquired.</p><p>Kasumi  nodded. She then put the car into gear and drove it out of the airport lot. The  drive home was done in silence. They arrived to find an empty house. Furinkan  was still closed, so neither Akane nor Nabiki could be at school. Kasumi noted  that both Nabiki's and her father's cars were missing. It was likely that they  were simply out doing errands or such.</p><p>After  dropping off his bags in the guest room he was using, Ranma went out to the  back yard to practice. Martial arts was difficult at best to do in a passenger  plane.</p><p>The Drake  looked around the plain grey room he was in. Earlier today, he had been at his  school overseeing the repairs. The day before, the Company agents from Forensic  Pathology section had finished with their analysis and had pulled out. They  were replaced by agents from Construction and Maintenance section and  Communications and Cryptography section.</p><p>They were repairing  the damaged walls and floors, upgrading the security systems, and cleaning up  the mess. The Drake was glad that his insurance policy was comprehensive enough  to cover "acts of mass violence". One advantage of being associated  with the Company was a heightened sense of paranoia.</p><p>However,  now more paranoia was not a benefit. He had been escorted from his office to  this room within WIC Toronto-A by a  pair of silent Company agents. The school administrator felt an almost  prophetic sense of foreboding. He knew what WIC was capable of and for the  first time in his life, he was afraid of them. The Drake looked up to see the  heavy metal door open.</p><p>"Hello,  Drake," Jacob sighed as he entered the small room. He sat down in the  chair on the opposite side of the table from the other man.</p><p>"What's  going on? Did something happen to my boy?" the Drake asked.</p><p>"Your  son's still a female Pattern D if that's what you mean," Jacob replied. "I'm  sorry, but this meeting is about something else."</p><p>The Drake  sighed with resignation.</p><p>"Why?"  Jacob asked. "You knew Genma was here and you knew we were looking for  him. Why didn't you tell us?"</p><p>The  principal looked at the brushed steel of the table. He had to tell the truth. As  much as it shamed him, he owed the Company that much.</p><p>Jacob  patiently waited as the Drake composed his thoughts. The agent concealed his  disappointment and worry. Removing and replacing the Drake was a simple enough  task, but it still weighed on his conscience. The elder Kuno had been a useful  associate to the Company. He had helped recruit over a dozen agents. It was a  shame for a man to be brought down like this.</p><p><i>But the Company does not take betrayal  lightly.</i> Jacob reminded himself. He would also allow the Drake to explain  his actions. He deserved that much.</p><p>Ranma  looked at the grandfather clock in the den again. It was now almost a quarter  of eight. He eased back into the recliner he was sitting in. There was still  time.</p><p>"You  should be happy that school's closed 'til Monday." Nabiki stated as she  came into the room.</p><p>"I  guess," Ranma replied. After the events of two days ago, going back to  Furinkan as a student seemed most strange.</p><p>"You  should be happy, it's less time as Sunshine," Nabiki stated.</p><p>Ranma  wanted to make a comment about how much he hated that monumentally moronic  name, or about the sickness inherent in being happy at getting a vacation just  because your school had been held hostage. Instead he shook his head and looked  at the clock again. He did not want to be late.</p><p>"Okay,  at least you got to spend some time with your fiancee," Nabiki tried. She  found Kasumi's interest in Ranma puzzling. It was strange. The elder Tendo  sister did not seem to have a romantic or a professional interest in Ranma, but  some slight hybrid of the two.</p><p>"Yeah,  I should go talk to her," Ranma said before getting up. It was still  early, but maybe he could get some help from Kasumi.</p><p>"Okay,"  Nabiki said as she watched Ranma leave the room. She then heard him go up the  stairs. She was slightly hurt and jealous. Kasumi seemed quite reluctant to  talk about her work, let alone help Nabiki get an interview, and now this guy  that she's just met is being whisked away to special corporate workshops.</p><p>She had the  distinct feeling of being in the dark. It was a vertigo-like foreboding  sensation. Something was going on, and she was going to find out what it was.</p><p>"So  where do you want me to drive you?" Kasumi asked in an even voice. She was  sitting on her bed working on her laptop.</p><p>"Just a  mile or so away from here. Someplace secluded ideally," Ranma said.</p><p>"Why?"  Her eyes were still on the computer screen.</p><p>"I  have some personal business to attend to."</p><p>"And  you don't want to have the people here wonder where you went?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Okay.  When do you want to go?"</p><p>"That's  it? You're not curious as who I'm meeting with?" Ranma was somewhat  surprised. He expected her to cooperate. She was under orders to help him, but  he thought that the agent would be more inquisitive.</p><p>"If  you wanted to tell me, you would have," Kasumi stated as she continued to  type. She would not pry into Ranma's personal affairs, but she would alert the  Company about what Ranma was doing.</p><p>"Okay  then. You mind taking me now?"</p><p>"No  problem," Kasumi said simply.</p><p>On their way  out, Kasumi told her father that Ranma had left some of his stuff at the office  and that she was driving him back to pick it up. She then drove him to a tract  housing construction site in the outskirts of Carrville,  a town eight miles west of the Tendo residence in Markham.</p><p>"Where  and when should I pick you up?"</p><p>Ranma got  out of the car and turned back to Kasumi. "I'll just go to your little  base downtown when it's over," Ranma stated as he closed his eyes and activated  his transformation. His form wavered to that of his female form before the  violet, black, and red lightshow turned her into Sailor DarkStar.</p><p>As the  demon stretched her wings and took to the air and flew off, Agent Tendo pulled  out her cell phone.</p><p>DarkStar's  flight path was on a southerly course. She went for about ten miles until she  reached Sunnybrook Park  and made her landing. It was rather dark and her approach was seen by only one  man.</p><p>The redhead  then shifted out of her pseudo-senshi form and into her human looking form. "At  least it's not a fuku," the teenaged demon said as she looked at her  little black leather dress.</p><p>"Hello,  Ranma," the man who had watched her landing greeted.</p><p>The redhead  simply glared at the man. While he did not call her Sunshine, he did arrange  for their meeting at <i>Sunny</i>brook Park.  "What's so urgent?" she asked. The letter that had been placed inside  her upper drawer had simply listed the time, location, and name.</p><p>"Pluto's  getting more and more desperate," the man stated as put his hands in his  coat.</p><p>"What's  she up to now?" Ranma asked, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>"If  your lack of cooperation continues, she might have to take more drastic  measures," Murdock warned.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"That  blonde's magic rock is quite powerful. It would be more than enough to make you  'get with the program.' " His voice was dangerously even.</p><p>"Fuck,"  Ranma swore. "What about the Company?"</p><p>"As  long as you kill those monsters, WIC's happy. Just be careful. If they consider  you a threat, they will try and eliminate you, but I doubt you'll start  indiscriminately killing people," Murdock said as he began to lead Ranma  down one of the park's paths. Two people standing in the same spot while they  talked was a bit too suspicious.</p><p>"Good.  Those clowns are at least accommodating. I still think they're up to  something," Ranma said as she scanned the smallish glen they had entered. Her  night vision, while not as good as when she's DarkStar, was still quite good.</p><p>"Undoubtedly,"  Murdock admitted. "However, they did try very hard to cure you."</p><p>"Yeah,  they did that, but I still can't trust them," Ranma said. "Hell, how  do I know you haven't been working for them all along?"</p><p>"I met  you a few days after Pluto turned you into this. If I had been working for the  Company, I would have told them all about you."</p><p>"No,  instead you omitted that fact, knowing full well that I'd meet an agent,"  Ranma indignantly responded.</p><p>"You <i>asked</i> me to keep your secret! And now  you're angry that I didn't break that promise to some creepy  organization," Murdock countered, his voice finally sounding not amused. "Your  father had run off, and the woman that had stolen your humanity had disappeared  into thin air. Who helped you after Pluto tricked you? Who was the one that  showed you how to stay sane? Who helped you through that month when you were  locked? You were alone. I helped you, and I risked my life to keep your secret.</p><p>"How  was I to know that your father was going to take you here? Are you taking  Pluto's side in all this? You know me. Do you really think that I've been  orchestrating all this? For god's sake! I'm not some all powerful chess master!  I'm just a runic mage."</p><p>"I'd  like to believe that," Ranma said while looking at her feet. It was hard  not to believe him. The only people who thought he was a monster had never met  the man and had only learned about him second hand from Pluto. The Company simply  considered his motives questionable, but they said that about everyone.</p><p>"Look,  I'm not asking you to trust me. I'm just here to warn you about Pluto."  Murdock shook his head</p><p>"What  about the other Senshi?"</p><p>"They're  good girls. A bit naive and overly trusting though."</p><p>"That's  what I thought. Can you tell me where Pluto lives?"</p><p>Murdock  blinked. "You're not thinking of going after her? That's exactly the kind  of thing that'll convince Moon to try and purify you."</p><p>"I'd  like to know where she lives," Ranma repeated, making eye direct eye  contact with Murdock. Violet flecked blue eyes locked onto watery grey ones.</p><p>"Fine,"  Murdock stated, looking off to the side. "You know those oval-shaped  buildings down by the Skydome? She lives in building three. It's on forty-two  Wellington Street, apartment number ten   twenty-nine. It's the same number as her birthday," Murdock  added smiling slightly.</p><p>"Thanks,"  the redheaded demon stated after she repeated the numbers to herself a couple  of times.</p><p>"Least  I could do," Murdock stated. "Is there anything else I could do for  you?"</p><p>"Nothing  now. I just wish there was a way out of this," Ranma sighed.</p><p>"You  could always leave. Pack up and go on the road," Murdock suggested as he adjusted  his silver tie clasp.</p><p>"I  can't do that. I can't just run away," Ranma said, mostly to herself.</p><p>"The  problem of ethics eh?" Murdock said. He then laughed. His voice then  turned grave. "Your morals are what keep you from being a monster. Not  your body. Just remember one thing though: don't allow yourself to be  manipulated by them, by anyone."</p><p>Ranma  nodded. She had strong suspicions as to why Murdock was telling her this.  "But what do they want?"</p><p>The man  smiled. "Victory."</p><p>"Thanks  Murdock, that really cleared things up," Ranma sighed. It was the kind of  answer she'd grown to expect from him.</p><p>He was  ready. The years of preparation, the innumerable sacrifices, the grueling  training, it was all going to pay off. Tonight he will slay the demon Saotome.  He gave his equipment and weapons one last check.</p><p>The young  man closed his eyes and cleared his mind. He then felt the gentle pull to his  right. Thanks to the Assembly's help, his curse was no longer a liability,  indeed it had become a most useful tool. Before he refined it, his sensitivity  to certain energies would cause a form of disorientation and confusion. Now, he  would never lose focus, never drift off course.</p><p>He smiled  slightly as he followed the trail. Soon his target was in visual range. The  monster matched the description he had been given earlier today. He noticed  that there was a bystander in close proximity to the target.</p><p>"Someone's  coming," Murdock said as he turned to face the person approaching from the  southwest.</p><p>Ranma  looked over to see the dark shape of a large, tall man running towards them.  "Damn," she muttered knowing no good could come from this.</p><p>"Filthy  monster! Your havoc ends now!" the man declared in a bellow.</p><p>"Fuck,  not again," Murdock sighed, under his breath. "You should get out of  the way," he advised Ranma.</p><p>Confusion  crossed the man's face. "I'm not after you. You're not in need of  destruction, human," he said to Murdock, who smiled faintly at this. "I'm  after her."</p><p>"Damn,"  Ranma said as she looked at the man. He looked to be a year of so older than  she was, and while his face was somewhat familiar his eyes were completely  alien. Ranma would remember someone with eyes in that bright shade of green.</p><p>"Damnation  is correct, demon. I <i>will</i> be the one  to send you back to hell." His eyes narrowed and for a second Ranma could  swear that they had flashed brighter.</p><p>The mage  appraised the intruder before speaking. "I think you can handle  this," Murdock laughed to Ranma. He then turned to the teenaged boy "So  this is the caliber of the Assembly's latest crop of acolytes? Let's see if  you'll handle this better than the Company." He then tipped his fedora to  Ranma before walking off.</p><p>"The  Company! Hah! Those faithless fools! They're nothing more than mercenaries with  fancy toys," the teen responded to Murdock's back.</p><p>Ranma  smiled slightly at this.</p><p>"I  wouldn't underestimate them," Murdock said as he continued to depart.</p><p>"Now  that the bystander has gone, we can get to business," he sneered as he pulled  a weapon out of his cloak.</p><p>Ranma's  eyes widened as she noticed the man's teeth, more specifically the canines that  were longer than the ones she had now but shorter than DarkStar's, and the  weapon he was wielding. "Ryoga? What the hell's going on? What's with your  eyes?" the girl asked. The last time she had seen him was years ago, but  she remembered that his eyes were dark brown.</p><p>"What's  the matter Ranma? Surprised that you're not the only one to have changed? Although  unlike you, I have not betrayed humanity," Ryoga taunted as he gripped the  handle of his weapon. "My long hunt ends now, tonight this ends!" He  then dove towards his opponent swinging the long blunt object at the redhead.</p><p>Ranma  dodged to the side and grabbed the ludicrous weapon. As she tried to twist the  oddly heavy black umbrella out of his left hand, Ryoga made a move with his  right. It was a small silver spray bottle, whose contents were propelled into  the demon's face.</p><p>The girl  sometimes known as Sunshine Saotome had a fraction of a second to chastise  herself for falling for such obvious misdirection. After that the skin on her  face started to burn off. She fell to the ground as the substance ate through  her flesh.</p><p>"Do  you really think I'd fight a demon without preparing myself," Ryoga  taunted, as he sprayed the dissolving flesh again. "Sadly holy water alone  is not enough to vanquish your vile kind, but the other ingredients can be  found with enough effort," he lamented as ribbons of muscle peeled off her  skull and burned away. Among the ingredients were holy items such as the blood  of an innocent and chemical ones such as a several powerful acids.</p><p>With her  last bit of energy Ranma gathered her will. Ryoga saw the mutilated girl's eyes  flare a brilliant violet and instinctively stepped back. Bands of black,  crimson, and purple energy began to wrap around her. Ryoga responded by trying  to crush her skull.</p><p>His weapon  was blasted away by a violet beam that came from where the girl's eyes would have  been. Another hit him in the chest, knocking him back several feet. Ryoga  quickly got back to his feet and ran to retrieve his weapon. As he grabbed the  hardwood handle of his umbrella, he turned to his foe.</p><p>The redhead  was standing again, her face no longer being eaten away by blessed fluid. She  was now wearing a violet bowed bikini top, a miniskirt that barely covered her  bottom, and black leather knee-high boots with five-inch heels. These were not  what he noticed first, not to say that he did not notice them. It did require  most of his training to keep his concentration in spite of the nearly naked  female in front of him. Knowing her true nature was a dramatic help. Most of his  attention <i>was</i> on her fangs, wings,  spade-ended tail, and glowing violet eyes.</p><p>"I've  had to deal with magical girls, secretive corporations, overly affectionate minions,  and monsters with bad Californian accents. I will <i>not</i> accept jilted and revenge bent demon hunters!" Sailor DarkStar  shouted as she summoned a violet orb in each hand. They glowed slightly and  were wreathed in white flames. The demonic magical girl then lobbed one of them  at her attacker.</p><p>Ryoga  pushed a button on the handle of his weapon and placed it to block. The  material of the umbrella was reinforced to act as a shield against most melee  weapons. Magical napalm was not something it had been designed to take. When he  saw the orb burst on the surface of the umbrella and ignite, Ryoga pressed the  other button on the handle.</p><p>As he side  stepped the other orb, he flicked his wrist. The burning umbrella slid off a  long metal spar that was concealed within the unusually large central spar. The  acolyte had just unsheathed a thin and relatively long, oddly hilted, sword. He  then trusted forward with the slivery blade.</p><p>DarkStar  smiled as she saw it approach. Partially-translucent red claws appeared on her  fingers, extending several inches beyond her nails. Shock hit her face when her  claws met his sword. Instead of neatly cutting through it, the blade's edge  began to glow in a sickly green light. Her ethereal claws met resistance.</p><p>This did  not slow her down, she twisted the blade with one hand while blasting at her  enemy with the other. Her tail then snaked around her body and rammed its way  into his stomach above the belly button. The minimal armor under his shirt  provided next to no resistance. Dozens of razor-sharp filaments from within her  tail sprung out and reduced several of his organs to an undifferentiated mush.</p><p>His eyes  unfocused and his grip lessened. His body fell to the ground, and the demon's  tail pulled itself out of him with a sound reminiscent of removing a ladle out  of a partially thick stew. This caused blobs of tissue and somewhat firmer  pieces of organs to splash out of the gapping wound. Ryoga's blood and chunks  of his body slowly dripped off the fins of her tail.</p><p>"Stupid  fucker," the redhead breathed. "You just had to try to come after me,"  she then said looking expectantly at the corpse. Something was wrong. She was  not getting anything from the body. Unlike those pathetic youma this was a nice  juicy human. "What a rip off!" the demon grumbled. It was a  guilt-free kill and nothing to show for it.</p><p>"The  hell?" she mumbled as she noticed something strange going on with the cadaver.  Her demonic senses could detect an external energy entering the body and she  could visually see the gaping hole in his chest reseal, and the burnt chunk of  meat that was his left shoulder regenerate.</p><p>The body's  eyes flipped open, revealing a pair of glowing orbs. DarkStar growled and lobbed  a sphere of napalm at him. With exceptional speed, especially considering that  Ryoga's condition, he grabbed his sword and intercepted the round. This caused  it to burst with predicable results.</p><p>"Let's  see you regenerate when you're just a pile of ash?" DarkStar taunted the  blazing body. She then noticed that the flames were changing color they went  from violet and white to a greenish color before sputtering out.</p><p>Ryoga then  flipped to an upright position. His grey cloak was in tatters and much of his  clothing had burned off revealing armor that resembled a modern version of  plate-mail. The burns on his skin, some of them quite severe, were in the  process of healing. "Filthy demon, you think I would go down that easily?"  Ryoga then asked as he readied his sword. It's blade was shimmering in a green  light.</p><p>"It  would have been nice," DarkStar admitted.</p><p>"This  is one soul you're not getting," Ryoga said as his body became surrounded  in a green light. It took a lot of concentration to do this, but his opponent  had proven herself to be quite dangerous.</p><p>"Hey!"  the redhead cried indignantly. Her eyes then flared and she fired a volley of  napalm filled spheres at her enemy. Ryoga did not even move. They hit him,  burst, ignited, and burned on his body before turning green and going dead.</p><p>Ryoga  smiled as he charged at the demon. He then came in from the upper left and  slashed down. As DarkStar dodged she noted that the demon hunter was noticeably  faster.</p><p>Using her  claws, she blocked and met his blade. This continued until he overextended his  blade in an attempt to pierce her heart. The demon then pushed the blade aside  with one hand while her tail made for his crotch.</p><p>Ryoga's  other hand reached out and grabbed the tail. He did it behind the spade-shaped  end and out of its filament's reach. Sailor DarkStar responded by pulling her  tail back. The acolyte dared not lessen his grip. He could easily regenerate  his hand but it would cost him precious seconds.</p><p>As she drew  him closer, Ryoga twisted his weapons out of her grip. As he then tried to stab  it into her side, DarkStar used her other hand to grab the soft flesh of his  neck. Her crimson claws sunk into the green energy that rested above Ryoga's  skin.</p><p>He watched  as a sadistic smirk grew on her blood-colored lips. The acolyte felt the power  protecting him wane. He knew what he had to do. Stabbing at her tail with his  sword he forced her to move that lethal appendage. When that happened, he  released his grip on it. He then used his now free hand to grab a small object  he had clipped to the back of his belt. As he pulled the pin and released the  spoon, he hopped that the fire had not damaged the mechanism.</p><p>Ryoga then  positioned the grenade so that it was between him and the demon. The explosion  served its purpose. Ryoga and DarkStar were torn apart from each other. The  acolyte looked down to see that several pieces of shrapnel had gone through him  causing what would be lethal levels of damage in a normal human. The shrapnel  had no supplemental effect on him. It simply tore through his body causing  extensive but repairable trauma. He was broken and bleeding, but he would  recover. A demonic entity, however, would find the specially engraved and  treated metal most unpleasant.</p><p>As he  picked up his sword he felt his neck. There were several deep and oozing  scratches on it. Their healing rate was alarmingly slow. Before he left he gave  a brief glance at the demon thrashing on the ground. She was extremely injured  too, but seemed much more lively than him.</p><p>Even with  her right leg bent in several unnatural places, he knew that she could still  kill him if he tried to finish her off. Without his full protection, he was  quite vulnerable to her attacks. He had to make his decision quickly. She  seemed to heal even faster than he did, and in his weakened state he would be  quite vulnerable to her fire attacks.</p><p>With a sigh  he closed his eyes and recalled the rendezvous point. He was loath to do this,  but he had no choice. He needed time to heal and rearm. The acolyte also  acknowledged that he could not kill the demon alone. He would need help.</p><p>The young  brunette nervously scanned the area around her car. Her darkened car was parked  on a road that bordered the park where the target was. The woman kept her  indignation controlled.</p><p>Her partner  refused to let her accompany him on this mission. She shook her head as the  man's poor judgment. It was foolhardy to go alone against a demon of that  power, especially for a lone male to go against one of that type.</p><p>She also  worried that her partner was keeping things hidden from her. During the  pre-mission planning he was unusually quiet and focused. She looked with some  care as a pair of silver sedans and a large black van drove past her.</p><p>She only  caught a glimpse of who was in them, but it was enough. The Company had arrived  on the scene. She felt a shudder go through her spine. Their presence  complicated things.</p><p>A few  minutes later, the women gave a sigh of relief as she saw the large form of her  partner. "I told you I should have gone with you!" she reprimanded as  he slumped into the passenger seat.</p><p>Her partner  looked like hell. His clothing and armor was burnt, cut, smashed, and drenched  in his own blood. Despite his healing abilities, he was covered in hideous  wounds. As he placed his sword in the space between the passenger seat and the  center console, she noticed that it was missing its umbrella scabbard.</p><p>"Did  you at least kill that little demon?" she asked after making sure that  none of his wounds were mortal to him.</p><p>"No,"  Ryoga admitted as he concentrated on letting his body heal.</p><p>She nearly  drove off the road at this "What? What happened? Did she fly off?"</p><p>Ryoga  simply nodded. He had already concealed so much from her, what did a little  more matter?</p><p>"God  damn-it!" DarkStar screamed as her shattered leg bones finished knitting  back together. She then stood on her somewhat shaky feet. The rest of her  wounds had healed, but her clothing, boots, and skin were still covered in  blood and gore. Annoyingly, some of it was hers. That damn grenade had to have  been designed to be more hurtful to demons. The pieces of it that had embedded  in her had burned quite fiercely and left angry wounds that healed slower and  with greater pain. She closed her eyes and a brief purple flash cascaded over  her, restoring her uniform to it's post transformation condition.</p><p>The demon  barely noticed this as she took to the air. To a lesser scale, the grenade had  damaged her opponent as well. Her extended senses allowed her to follow his  blood trail, both literally and metaphorically. She landed at the side of a  road that made the southern edge of the park.</p><p>Her eyes  flared as she looked down either side of the road. Ryoga had obviously gotten  into a vehicle of some kind. In the couple minutes it took her to heal, he  could have gone miles in any direction. Sailor DarkStar growled as she flexed  her fingers. She was so close. In the moment before the grenade went off she  felt his shield sputter out and her claws begin to carve into his flesh.</p><p>The  presence of a pair of humans behind her caused the demon to swivel around.  "Oh, it's you guys," the demon said to the Company agents. They were  both twenty-something males that were dressed in the expected Company fatigues and  armor. They had night vision equipment attached to their goggle assemblies and  had good sized rifles pointed at the ground.</p><p>"Hey Gabe, hey Aram,"  she then greeted, looking at both of them as she said their names. She recognized  them by their <i>scent</i>, but did not know  which one was which.</p><p>"What  happened out here?" the one on the left asked.</p><p>"Yeah,  base picked up a pretty big pattern bloom on the remotes," the other  stated.</p><p>"Some  guy who I knew came after me seeking revenge. It's over now," Ranma explained  after transforming out of her DarkStar form. With some annoyance she found  herself in Sunshine's school uniform.</p><p>"Oh I  see," the one on the right replied while the other talked into his headset.  "This is Gabriel. Signature has been identified.. Situation has been  explained. Returning to base."</p><p>"Good  seeing you," Aram  replied as he and his partner turned around.</p><p>"You  guys mind giving me a ride?" the redheaded schoolgirl inquired. "I'm  supposed to meet with Kasumi."</p><p>"Sure  thing," Aram  responded.</p><p>The trio  quickly crossed the park. Ranma looked over to see that the area where she had  fought Ryoga had been marked off and a pair of agents were guarding the  position. The demoness knew that a team from Forensic Pathology section would  arrive soon enough. They would then photograph the scene and collect everything  of interest from the site. No doubt Ryoga's trick umbrella will eventually end  up in some obscure WIC warehouse among other oddities.</p><p>They  emerged in a parking lot positioned on the park's North side. The lot was  splashed with blue and red in slowly rotating patterns. The two grayish-silver  sedans with their pulsing headlights taillights and partially hidden grill  lights looked remarkably like unmarked police cars. The large black van with  its roof mounted lights also bore a strong resemblance to a SWAT vehicle. However,  Ranma knew better.</p><p>She  followed Aram  and Gabriel as they commandeered one of the sedans. Ranma found herself in the  front passenger seat. After he sat down in the driver's seat, Gabriel handed  his rifle to Aram  who was sitting in the back. Both agents then pulled their goggles up onto  their helmets.</p><p>A young man  who was tall with broad shoulders and had a dusky complexion observed the  proceedings from a distance. He wanted to get closer, but there was a  plainclothes agent who was watching the small crowd. The teen did not want to  be recognized by the Company. It was bad enough that they were monitoring the  school. It would be rather counterproductive to attract this much attention, at  least this early in the game.</p><p>Ranma  walked down the corridors of WIC Toronto-A.  She was finally starting to get the hang of the layout of the underground  structure. An agent was still providing escort. This time it was in the form of  Aram following  three paces behind the redhead. Apparently, Gabriel had been called to appear  before Jacob or something.</p><p>It was a  rather amusing - a lone schoolgirl in a Seifuku and a soldier in battledress  walking down the grey hallways of what looked to be some type of governmental  installation. Soon enough they reached a lounge that was positioned near the  main briefing room and the Command and Communications   Center.</p><p>Entering  the room, Ranma was surprised to see Kasumi sitting in the room's couch reading  a worn paperback. The woman looked up at Ranma and her subordinate, looked back  at her book, and then placed it on an end table.</p><p>"I  heard your meeting ended poorly," Kasumi observed as she got up to refill  her mug.</p><p>"There  was an intrusion at the end," Ranma said evenly. She turned around to see  that Aram had  left and closed the door behind himself, giving the simulation of privacy.</p><p>"Someone  from your past you said," Kasumi stated before taking a sip of her coffee.</p><p>"Yeah,  stupid bastard Ryoga." Ranma remarked as she went to the kitchenette's  sink. The fluid from the hot water tap quickly restored the martial artist's  birth gender. "What do you know about a group called the Assembly?"</p><p>"Their  full name is the Assembly of Man. They're a small, rather fanatical, group that  hunts demons." Kasumi stated with some distaste. She did not mention that they  had a quasi-Christian ideology of purity, one that most Christians would find  downright repugnant, and students of history would find worryingly familiar.</p><p>"So  they're like the Company then?" Ranma asked as he dried his hands. They  felt strangely dirty.</p><p>"Not  in the slightest. Willard International Consulting is a paramilitary  organization. We're organized in a military fashion. We use highly trained and  well-equipped teams to kill our targets. This requires three things: personnel;  infrastructure to recruit, train, equip, deploy and command the personnel; and  lots of capital to pay for infrastructure, equipment, and personnel."</p><p>"And  the Assembly can't afford things like helicopters, jets, and giant underground  complexes," Ranma surmised. He remembered that Ryoga said that the Company  was "nothing more than mercenaries with fancy toys."</p><p>"Exactly.  But they still want to fight rather powerful Pattern Registering Entities. Small  groups of normal humans cannot fight such monsters and hope to survive. Fortunately  for the Assembly, they had a solution. It was hard to control, dangerous to  their own people, and insanely risky."</p><p>"They  found a way to make their hunters, acolytes, whatever regenerate," Ranma  said with realization. This was the exact kind of procedure that Ryoga would  take up. Given that the original animosity had never been resolved, three days  was a long enough wait, Ryoga would obsess over it until thoughts of revenge  consumed his mind.</p><p>That his  childhood nemesis would turn out to be a demon would greatly compliment Ryoga's  quest for revenge. The vengeance was no longer something personal and petty, it  was something... holy. Ryoga now had a duty to slay the demon.</p><p>Ranma wondered  how long Ryoga had been a member of this Assembly. If he had joined before or  after he had learned of DarkStar.</p><p>"Yes  they did," Kasumi answered, interrupting Ranma's thoughts. "We don't  exactly know how they did it. Obviously the process is a closely held secret.  We do know that it allows them to rapidly recover from injury. Some of their  more advanced personnel can even generate something close to a protective  aura."</p><p>"Yeah,  he had that."</p><p>"How  old is this Ryoga?" Kasumi asked, recalling the name.</p><p>"About  my age."</p><p>"And  he's still an acolyte?" Kasumi asked. Ranma nodded. "Then he's  something of a prodigy."</p><p>"Well,  that's just great," Ranma grumbled.</p><p>"There's  also the issue of how he found you and when he'll come after you again. Clearly,  he knows of the curse and DarkStar."</p><p>"Don't  worry. I can take care of him," Ranma flatly stated.</p><p>Kasumi  simply nodded.</p><p>"Well,  this is just what we need," Jacob observed after he watched the  conversation between Lieutenant Tendo and Ranma Saotome for the second time. He  and Stillwater were in the  Commander's office.</p><p>"I  find it interesting that this acolyte was able to survive a Pattern D-Silver  Class 10," Stillwater  remarked.</p><p>"That  is their specialty. I'm sure he had plenty of demon juice and holy hand  grenades," Jacob replied using Company slang for holy water that was  mostly very caustic acids, and grenades that had various lines of Scripture on  them and special chemicals that were quite unpleasant to demons. The effectiveness  of the religious aspects was a matter of some debate among Science and  Technology section.</p><p>Jacob  continued. "What <i>I</i> find  interesting is that this Ryoga was an associate of Ranma's."</p><p>"What's  one more coincidence with him? Lord knows he's got enough of them," Stillwater  observed as he scratched his goatee.</p><p>"You  think Murdock's involved?" Jacob asked in a statement that was only half a  question.</p><p>"When  isn't he?"</p><p>"Ranma  did go to the park with the intention of meeting someone."</p><p>Stillwater  nodded. "And because we're respecting his privacy somewhat, we don't know  who it was or what they said."</p><p>"You're  still worried that Murdock's playing us all against each other."</p><p>"Yes,"  Stillwater agreed.</p><p>Jacob  nodded. "What should we do about the Assembly? It's a shame we can't just  convince them that DarkStar's not something they have to worry about."</p><p>"That  would be just great. Finally give those lunatics the proof that we're in league  with dark forces. Even if they did call it off, there's still a chance that their  hunter might not listen. After all, it is personal to him. Especially after  tonight."</p><p>"And  what if they respond by sending more of their people?"</p><p>"If  these upstarts want to cross us, I have no problem with putting them in their  place."</p><p>"There  aren't too many of them," Jacob confirmed.</p><p>"What  about the Drake?"</p><p>"You  haven't watched the tape?" Jacob asked with some puzzlement</p><p>"Yes,  I have. It's just that I'd like to get your take on what he said. Do you really  believe his explanation?"</p><p>"As  insane as it sounds. There is some credence to it. A team just found the old  school surveillance tape he hid."</p><p>"So  the blackmail part was true at least," Stillwater  observed.</p><p>"Any  guesses as to who else is with him on that tape?" Jacob said smiling  slightly.</p><p>Usagi  wandered what should have been familiar crystal corridors of the palace. She  was wearing the white gown she would later wear as Neo Princess Serenity. That  is if Crystal Tokyo was still a viable future. Her dress did not fit quite right,  especially around her waist, but she discounted that.</p><p>The  formally dressed blonde eventually found a doorway that lead to a large  overhanging balcony. From it she could see the terrain. The first thing she  noticed was the sun rising over a body of water that stretched to the horizon.  Looking down she could see that the central complex of spires she was in was  surrounded by a series of gardens, grass, and paths. These inner courtyards  were then bounded by an immense crystal wall. On one side, this wall met the  water. One the other sides, buildings had been removed and grass had been  planted to provide clear lines of approach.</p><p>She could  see one impressively solid-looking gatehouse complex. On the road approaching  it were a pair of black armored vehicles, and around them were groups of armed  black and grey clad soldiers. Looking at the courtyards and the wall again she  could see groups of them patrolling the castle complex. When she strained her  eyes, she could just barely see the orange of their visors or goggles.</p><p>Usagi could  also hear the waves smashing onto that one wall, but she did not smell salt in  the air. With that piece of knowledge she knew what city she was in. A brief  glance at the other building she could see quickly confirmed this.</p><p>The royal  then turned when she head someone approach. She looked to see a trio of nubile  demons in a protective detail. Each was wearing black, low-cut skin tight tops  with thin armor paneling. The garments had red trim and were open in the back  to allow for their wings. They also wore tight, little dark violet skirts that  barely went to mid-thigh, red leather belts, violet-trimmed fingerless gloves  that went to the middle of their forearms, and heavy boots with two inch heels.</p><p>The blonde  looked briefly looked at the demon in the front of the procession. She had a  lithe attractive form. Her long black, violet highlighted, hair was and pulled  back into a loose ponytail. Her eyes were a deep blood-colored red. She had the  expected physical attributes. The horns on her forehead were red, her tail was  violet with black fins, and her wings were black with violet tips. Usagi found  this demon particularly familiar.</p><p>She then  turned her attention to who they were escorting. It was a woman in a highly  corseted, petticoated, and lacy dark-violet ball  gown. Her deep crimson hair was pulled up, then down her back and between her  wings through the use of dozens of spiraled black ribbons. Usagi also noted  that there was a discrete hole for the woman's spade-shaped tail.</p><p>As  she walked Usagi could just barely see the demoness' six inch high violet high  heeled pumps. The blonde could see the sparkle of jewels on the woman's  footwear. Fixed on them were tiny rubies and amethysts that formed strange  patterns. Similar gems were on the woman's black elbow length gloves. On these  the patterns were clearer but no more comprehensible.</p><p>The young  woman wore a golden crown that was set under her horns. It was set with a black  orb in the center with a large  ruby on either side of it and an amethyst on either side of that. She had  a silver necklace with a large ruby gem and multiple pairs of hanging earrings.  She also wore the Silver Millennium era ring that was only to be worn by the sovereign  of Earth. Made out of gold, it had the Terran seal on it.</p><p>Her makeup  was in a very elegant and regal style that perfectly set her deep violet eyes  that looked simultaneously seductive and commanding. "Greetings my  queen," the woman said in a feminine and courtly voice.</p><p>"DarkStar?  What's going on?" Usagi asked with uncertainty. Things were quite  confusing. The only way she kept herself from losing it was by locking onto  those beautiful violet eyes.</p><p>Worry  crossed the redhead's face. "Nariko, can you and your girls please step  out for a minute?" the queen of Earth asked to the demon with the red eyes  and black hair. The demon nodded and then had the two other demon-girls march  out of sight.</p><p>DarkStar  then turned to the blonde magical girl. "I know how troubling this is for  you. You were supposed to rule the world with my predecessor," the demon  said in a soothing voice as she walked closer to Usagi. "But in spite of  those setbacks, we are triumphant. Murdock has been defeated. The world is safe  and at peace. We won," as she said this, DarkStar gently grasped Usagi's  hands. She then pulled the other girl in close, and hugged her.</p><p>Usagi  responded to the embrace. She felt secure, safe. "So Crystal Tokyo  happened?" Usagi asked as she leaned her head on the taller girl's chest.</p><p>Sorrow  darkened the redhead's face. "I'm sorry. We lost Tokyo.  The resistance managed to smuggle a bomb into the city. The palace's shields  protected us, but everyone else in the city..."</p><p>Usagi  blinked unsure of how to take that piece of information. Tokyo  destroyed. A resistance that was willing to wipe cities off the map to stop  them. She started sniffled and her eyes started to tear up.</p><p>DarkStar  saw this and held the blonde's face close to hers. "Don't worry, my love. I  will always protect you," she said staring into the blonde's eyes. Once  again Usagi held onto those wonderful amethyst eyes. When the demon moved in to  kiss her, Usagi leaned in to meet her lips.</p><p>The two  girls pulled each other closer. They crushed their gowns into each other as  they continued to kiss. Usagi felt the redhead's tail wrap around her legs. Eventually  they broke apart.</p><p>The demon  then took on a wistful look "I've always been fond of humans. My time as  one of them has only reinforced this. I would never be cruel to these sweet and  useful people, but regretfully they do need to be controlled. After all, we need  them as much as they need us," Queen DarkStar stated with a smiled as she  looked over at the animals she stewarded.</p><p>"We?"  Usagi asked with definite dread.</p><p>DarkStar  turned to her mate. "Don't you remember? You decided that you wanted to be  converted."</p><p>Usagi shook  her head. That made no sense. She would never sign off her humanity… but a part  of her knew that she <i>was </i>more than  human. She was a being of great power. One that was destined to live for centuries  and to rule all of humanity.</p><p>Usagi then turned  to one of the rather reflective crystal walls and looked carefully at her mirrored  image. Her eyes were still the same. So were her teeth, although her gaze did  linger on her canines for a rather long time. She still had a pair of large  white wings, but they were no longer puffy and made of feathers. What was even  more damning were pair of little horns that poked their way out of her hair. That  they were a pure white in color only seemed to make it worse, like a cruel,  cruel joke. With dread realization she knew why the back of her gown did not  fit quite right. Undoubtedly, there was a white spade-ended tail hidden within  her dress.</p><p>Screaming  in revulsion, horror, and a bit of desire and anticipation, the blonde girl  forced herself out of this dream. She then found herself awake in her  apartment, unsure of what to do next.</p><p>Janet  Frasier knew a thing or two about dreams. She knew that while some dreams could  be prophetic, most of them were not. She also knew that some dreams were not  created solely by the dreamer, instead they were sent by others. Her training  had taught her to control and protect her dreams. For some, sleep was when they  were most vulnerable.</p><p>Last night  was the first night since moving to Toronto  where she had been able to sleep undisturbed. The girl feared what she had she  had to do. There was some dread at the tasks ahead.</p><p>Janet  pushed those thoughts aside and concentrated on finishing getting dressed. She  carefully scrutinized her uniform. Her white blouse was properly pressed,  buttoned, and tucked in to her purple skirt, and that there was no noticeable  bulge in the small of her back where her weapon was kept. She then checked that  the skirt was straight and that the pleats hung properly.</p><p>She then  carefully tied her blue ribbon tie, and put on her jacket. The girl then put on  her Mary-Janes. She would have preferred boots, but  her mother insisted that she wear something more feminine. As she secured the  buckles on them, she reflected that at least they were a nice shade of blue and  that the heel on them was rather low.</p><p>After  applying her makeup, the girl then brushed out her rich shoulder length auburn  hair into a light center part. Her uniform also came with a blue beret, but  that went into her backpack. It was the one part of the uniform that really  annoyed her. Fortunately, wearing them was not heavily enforced.</p><p>Janet then  put her notebooks, textbooks, and purse in her backpack. The girl then walked  over to the mirror on her closet door and appraised her reflection one last  time. Her lightly made-up lips smiled slightly. She did clean up nice, she had  to admit. Her thin eyebrows then raised in surprise at the familiarity of the  Seifuku. It was a frustrating sense of deja-vu. One that she fully understood.</p><p>Janet then walked out of her room and  into the main room of the apartment. She looked to see her mother cleaning up  the breakfast they had finished a ten minutes ago. The teen then exchanged  pleasantries with the woman in the white lab-coat and nametag that read  "Dr. Nadine Fraiser (Radiology)", and had a logo for North York  General Hospital on it. The logo consisted of a blue semi-circle. Inside of it  was a white N who's second vertical spar became the vertical spar of a Y that  had a strange echoing repeat on it's right side. A dot that was placed in the  cup of the Y gave the impression of a line of stick figures with their arms  raised.</p><p>The girl  understood her mother's worry. Today was the first school day since the incident,  but she was confident that it would be okay. And even if things went sour, she  could take care of herself. She hated keeping secrets from her mother, but  certain things had to be done.</p><p>Janet then  left her apartment, went down the hallway, and took the stairs to the ground  floor lobby. She checked her watch to confirm that she would have more than  enough time to walk the few blocks to Furinkan and take care of something.</p><p>"You  okay?" Minako asked the other blonde. The quintet of girls were walking to  school. The Monday morning was unusually clear and had a slight wind that made  it bright yet brisk.</p><p>"What?"  Usagi asked with some confusion. "Oh yeah, I'm fine. It's just...  nothing."</p><p>Rei studied  the girl's face before speaking. "No, there's something. You've been  acting weird ever since that night you woke up screaming with that 'Charley  Horse.' " The girl's tone indicated that she did not believe Usagi's  excuse.</p><p>"Yeah, I mean normally she's the one with  the freaky dreams," Makoto said pointing to Rei.</p><p>"Thanks,"  Rei deadpanned before turning to Usagi. "Seriously, is anything wrong? Is  it something we need to be worried about?"</p><p>Usagi  stared at the sky for a few seconds. She assured herself was just a dream, and  it was far, far into the future. "No nothing. At least for a while,"  the girl stated.</p><p>"If  you say so," Rei responded.</p><p>"Was  Setsuna able to get the cats out of quarantine?" Ami asked, interjecting  into the conversation.</p><p>"Yeah.  After school she's going to take me and Usagi to get them," Minako replied.</p><p>"Maybe  they can help," Usagi supposed.</p><p>"I  doubt it. They can hardly remember the <i>end</i>  of the Silver Millennium, let alone something that happened five hundred years  before that, and don't get me started about this Murdock business or the  Company."</p><p>"Still...  they might be of some use," Usagi stated before changing the subject to  something a bit more inane. They walked for a few minutes until a salutation  from behind caused them to stop.</p><p>Strolling  out of the entrance of the convenience store the girls had just walked past was  a Furinkan High School student. She was reading from a magazine that she had  just purchased.</p><p>Minako's  face lit up with recognition at the neatly dressed girl. It was the other new  kid in the morning classes she had with Ami. Her name started with a "J."</p><p>"Hi  Janet," Ami greeted her classmate.</p><p>The auburn-haired  girl smiled as she put her magazine down. "Hey Ami. So, these are your  roommates then?" she</p><p>"Yeah,"  Ami confirmed with a slight twinge of nervousness.</p><p>"So  which one stained your blouse?" Janet asked as she briefly studied the  other four girls. One of the blondes was in several of her classes.</p><p>"Ami,  who's your friend?" Usagi asked as she looked between the two girls.</p><p>"This  is Janet Fraiser. We share some classes together," Ami introduced.</p><p>Janet  transferred her magazine to her left hand and shook hands with Usagi. The  blonde looked into the other girls gray-green eyes and saw nothing amiss.  "Hey, how's it going? Yeah, I just moved here with my mother," Janet  explained. She then turned to Ami. "Oh, the moving company finally found  where they shipped all our stuff."</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"Toronto."  Janet then paused, "But Toronto Ohio. Fortunately it's only three – four  hundred miles away. We should have it by tomorrow."</p><p>"Good  for you," Ami said.</p><p>"So  how did you meet?" Makoto asked she had turned her head to read the title  of the magazine. It had a futuristic plane of some kind on the cover and was  entitled <i>Popular Mechanics</i>. Strange  reading for a teenage girl.</p><p>"In  the laundry room. When you were cleaning the blouse I stained. That would mean  you live in the same building as us," Usagi stated.</p><p>"Not too  shabby," Janet observed. "You're right. Because the movers lost our  stuff, me and mom were short on clothes. Good to see a blonde who's brains aren't  mush."</p><p>"She  just got lucky," Makoto teased.</p><p>"American  right?" Minako asked the girl.</p><p>"Yup,  and you guys are a group of Japanese exchange students if I'm not  mistaken."</p><p>"Was  it our accents?" Minako inquired. She had spent time in England and hers  could be harder to detect.</p><p>"That  and how at ease you are in these things," Janet said as she lightly tugged  at her uniform's collar. She was careful not to mess it up.</p><p>"This  is great and all, but we should start walking to school. Unless you guys want to  be late to school?" Rei interrupted.</p><p>Ranma  picked at her lunch in the Furinkan cafeteria. While tasty, the bowl of beef  stroganoff was disturbingly familiar. The redhead sighed and idly tugged at her  left earring. She stopped when the back to the stud post started to dig into  her earlobe.</p><p>"What's  wrong?" Naoko asked, concern on her face.</p><p>"Oh,  I'm okay, just distracted," the crimson-haired demon said in a distant  voice.</p><p>"You  sure?" Samantha inquired as she put her left hand on Ranma's right. "  If something's wrong you can talk to us. Is it about the attack? To tell you  the truth, I'm still weirded out by it."</p><p>The martial  artist smiled faintly at this. It was kinda nice to have some normal people to  talk to. Her smile then died. These were not Ranma Saotome's new friends but  Sunshine Saotome's. They only knew her as another school-girl who had a stupid  name and rebelled against it by dressing darkly, to such an extent that she  found the normal Furinkan uniform too cheery and made a set of custom ones. They  knew a girl that favored purple, black, and red. To them, Ranma Saotome was her  brother, and to Sunshine's great discomfort, someone that they asked if they  could date.</p><p>Given all  this, Sunshine knew that she could not tell them the truth. That the real  reason she was out of it did not have to do with the attack, at least not  directly. Destroying those youma <i>had</i>  been fun and satisfying. The real reason was that the last time she was in this  room, she had turned Tatewaki Kuno into a female demon.</p><p>There was  also the fight with Ryoga. She remembered the sense of frustration at being  unable to take his soul. She had no qualms about trying to kill him, the  bastard burned off her face, tried to skewer her with that stupid  umbrella-sword, and then he used a grenade on her. Lethal force was more than  justified. Wanting to devour his soul afterwards however...</p><p>"Sunshine!"  Samantha stated as she waved a hand in front of the redhead's face.</p><p>"Sorry,  I guess I am out of it today," the Saotome girl admitted as she looked at  her blonde friend.</p><p>"That's  alright," Naoko reassured.</p><p>Sunshine  nodded and resumed her attempts to eat. She was interrupted by an enthusiastic  greeting by a familiar voice. The girl turned to see another teenage girl. She  had black hair with violet highlights, skin that was slightly less pale than  Sunshine's, and eyes that were a deep crimson. Her appearance was quite human,  though the redhead knew better.</p><p>"Hi  Sunshine, I've missed you" the girl repeated in a gushingly sugary voice  as she sat down next to the other demon-girl.</p><p>"You're  here!" Sunshine cried angrily. Her tone then became more morose. "Of  course you'd be here. It's not like it'd be hard for you to get enrolled."</p><p>"My  uncle <i>is</i> the principal," the  girl countered.</p><p>Sunshine's  brow furrowed in puzzlement, but she kept silent. If her identity was being  kept secret by the Drake, the same thing would likely be done for his  "son."</p><p>"So  you're the Principal Kuno's niece?" Samantha asked.</p><p>"Yup,  I'm Nariko Kuno," the girl smiled while trying to lean on Sunshine, who  pushed her aside. She then spoke in a conspiratorial tone "I transferred  here because I got kicked out of my previous school. They said I was a  troublemaker."</p><p>"And  with a relative in charge they think you'll be under control?" Naoko  asked.</p><p>"I  guess," Nariko shrugged.</p><p>"You  know where Tatewaki is?" Naoko asked the girl. He had a crush on Sunshine  and would normally pester her, but he was nowhere to be found.</p><p>"He  finally got accepted to that military academy," Nariko replied after a  slight pause.</p><p>"The  one in Ottawa he always babbled about?" Samantha asked.</p><p>"That's  the one."</p><p>"Look's  like you have another friend here," Naoko said to Sunshine.</p><p>"Woo  ho," the redhead deadpanned.</p><p>"She's  just kidding," Nariko smiled. "You know how Sunshine is. Can't let  anyone see her happy or smile," the red-eyed girl joked, causing Samantha  and Naoko to laugh and Sunshine to groan.</p><p>Usagi had  reentered the cafeteria after using the bathroom. As she passed the table that  Sunshine was at she stared at the three girls that sat with her. She had a  sickening sense of vertigo as she looked at them. There was a disturbing correlation  between the quartet of demoness in her dream and the four schoolgirls sitting  at the table.</p><p>Usagi  stopped when she heard the name Nariko come up. She then looked at the red-eyed  girl more closely. Save for a lack of the extra anatomy, she was identical to  the demon that had lead Queen DarkStar's security detail in her dream.</p><p>"Um,  Sunshine? Can I talk to you?" Usagi asked eyeing the redhead.</p><p>"Let  me guess - it's in private again," Sunshine asked as she stood up. She  then lead Usagi out of the cafeteria and into the bathroom that,  coincidentally, Usagi had just left. There was undoubtedly some form of camera  surveillance, but the redhead just wanted privacy from the other students.  "Okay so what do you want?" Sunshine asked as she studied her  reflection. It looked like Ryoga's attack had left no permanent damage to her  face.</p><p>Usagi  blinked. For someone who was really a guy, she really spent a lot of time  checking her makeup. "What's your relationship with that Nariko?" the  blonde asked. She half expected Sunshine to open her purse and start rummaging  around in it.</p><p>The redhead  made eye contact with the other girl. "Look, I just saved her life, that's  all!" Sunshine stated, sternly.</p><p>"Oh I  see. Look just don't do anything to her," Usagi warned. The dream may have  foretold that girl's name and physical description, but that was all it was  going to do.</p><p>Sunshine  paused, her face darkening. "Good lord no! What the hell's wrong with you!  I'd never do anything with <i>her</i>!"</p><p>"Thank  god," Usagi said with relief.</p><p>"And  what's this all about?" Sunshine asked.</p><p>"I had  a dream with you and her in it," Usagi admitted as she looked down at the  floor.</p><p>"That's  disgusting," Sunshine responded.</p><p>The redhead  grumbled as she got out of Nabiki's Ford. School had definitely gone downhill  after lunch. Despite being a year older than her, Kuno had decided to go back a  year and be in all the same classes as her.</p><p>At least  during class Nariko was quiet enough and did not try anything weird, but it was  still creepy. As she walked up the driveway, she saw that Kasumi was sitting in  the swinging bench on the front porch. She was reading a book while her left  hand idly scratched her right forearm. She then put her book down and greeted  her two sisters and her, currently female, fiance.</p><p>As she  passed the Company agent, the aqua-transsexual saw something that made her  stop. Kasumi turned to the redhead, smiled, and winked. She then went back to  her book.</p><p>The demon  blinked and continued into the house. She was trying to figure what <i>that</i> meant, and almost ran into Soun,  who was standing in the foyer. The elder Tendo cleared this throat.  "Akane, Nabiki, could you to please go upstairs?" he asked his  daughters before leading the Saotome girl into the kitchen.</p><p>"Why  hello Sunshine," Nodoka said from the kitchen table while Genma sat  somewhat stunned at the other side.</p><p>[End chapter 5]</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Prereaders for this chapter are Starfire,  Joe Fenton, Black Dragon, and Wray.</p><p>I'd also like to point out that the Fanart at my website has  been updated, by</p><p>some really nice work by Mike Koos.</p><p>[go to the site listed as my webpage on my  main page  from there you can go to the site.</p><p>One more  thing. Many of you may have noticed that most of the cast in The Return has  back stories that are only alluded to. Such as the original DarkStar, Kasumi's  training and early missions, Ryoga and his experiences in the Assembly, Murdock  and his deal, WIC's History, Soun and the Drake's moving to Canada, Nodoka's  experience at the Company, the Drake's work at the Company, Jacob's history, and  many, many other possible stories.</p><p>The Company  mythos itself provides a wide range of locations and times in history where  events can take place.</p><p>Many of  these I will be covering later on in the story, or I will write them as  separate side stories. The Company's history and Murdock's past are two examples  of these. For the others I have a proposition.</p><p>If any of  you are interested in writing some of these side stories, send me an email, and  we can try and work out something. Naturally certain requirements have to be  made to prevent confliction with facts and events in the main story.</p><p>One final  thing.  I've also started a pre project  to catalog all the Ranma-in-a-fuku-fics. That's slightly incorrect term for  fics where Ranma a Sailor Senshi, or is in a uniform similar to that of a  Sailor Senshi.</p><p>[go to the site listed as my webpage on my  main page  from there you can go to the site.</p><p>I'm off to  a pretty good start at thirty-seven stories cataloged. If you wrote a fic that  I missed, or know of a fic that I missed, please tell me. Remember for this  list Ranma has to wear the fuku, or something rather close. Good rule of  thumb.  Kenko's  Paragon doesn't count, but my DarkStar does.   Remember the primary qualification is the Seifuku.</p>
