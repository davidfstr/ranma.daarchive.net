</div>Disclaimer<p>Ranma and all related characters are property of Rumiko Takahashi. Candidate for Goddess is not mine either. I am merely using these characters and storyline for entertainment purposes only.<p>Candidate Ranma for Goddess<p>Chapter 1 - Transport<p>"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!" The young boy enthused repeatedly, his face planted into the window.<p>"What? Is this the first time you've ever seen a planet?" Another older pig-tailed boy next to him said. The effect was somewhat hampered due to the fact that his own face was pressed tight against the window as well.<p>At his comment, the 4 other occupants looked at him strangely. The oldest man, tall, well muscled, but with several specks of grey in his hair, spoke. "Well, it IS quite uncommon, you know. And you realize that you also seem quite occupied with the view yourself, you know." They now knew him as the captain of the transport ship they were currently on.<p>Ranma gave him a dirty look, "Well, being raised on the ground all my life, I ain't never had a chance to go to space much, old man."<p>The boy with the glasses adjusted them with his middle finger; "I presume you've never had a chance to go in any flight simulators when you were on your colony?"<p>"Colony? What's that? Some kinda candy?"<p>The boy laughed, "Silly, unless you're from Zion, which I personally doubt, EVERYONE has lived in a colony. Its an artificial living space for people to live in, remember?"<p>"No, can't say I've been in any colony. I've lived on a planet all my life," Shocked silence met this statement.<p>"You're really from Zion?" the excitable boy jumped in his face.<p>Ranma gave him another strange look, "What? No one's ever mentioned Earth after its discovery? Man, and I thought WE were the dumb ones."<p>The captain grabbed his head, or tried to anyway, and shouted, "For your information, that knowledge was CLASSIFIED!"<p>"Oh, right...but since the c-c-c...ah, you-know-what's outta the bag, these guys outta know, right?"<p>"There is another planet the Victim haven't destroyed yet?" the boy with the glasses asked incredulously, "Now, I can understand the reason for the secrecy. If not many people know about it and keep away from it, we can hope to keep the Victim from discovering and destroying it, right?"<p>Shocked, Ranma looked at him, "De...Destroyed?"<p>"As far as we knew, Zion was the only inhabited planet that hasn't yet been destroyed by the beings known as the Victim. We have been defending against them, but steadily losing for quite some time. Zion is our last hope. The fact that you've come from another planet indicates that you're quite lucky. But this also means that we may need to spread out our defenses once again to cover that planet as well, or it will be a prime target for the Victim." he now had a troubled look on his face.<p>Halfway through the initial explanation, the excitable brown-haired boy went back to the window and kept up his mantra of "Awesome!" throughout.<p>After hearing out the boy, Ranma turned back to the window himself, a troubled look on his face this time.<p>"Don't worry, we've sent out a large secret force to cover your planet and request reinforcements when needed, Mr. Saotome," the captain said, trying to be reassuring.<p>The brown-haired boy finally seemed to calm down somewhat, and turned around, "And I hardly feel sick anymore!"<p>The captain gave him a sharp look, "Sick?"<p>"Yeah, ever since we left I've been feeling a bit ill lately."<p>"You mean...you have...zero...gravity...sickness? There was no data about this..." he started looking through his clipboard, tapping it with a little pen. Ranma came and looked over his shoulder. It was one of those new electronic things that held a lot of data and was a lot easier to use than regular paper, he found. "How can he be a pilot with this?"<p>"I will! I will become a pilot of one of the Goddesses. I have blood type OE, EX positive as well. People with that combination are rare, I know. We are the only ones who can become pilots. Which is why I'm here" he reached into his shirt and brought out a keycard attached to a chain.<p>"HEY! You made a hole in the boarding card! How can you do this? You weren't supposed to do that! When did you?" the captain shouted, suddenly enraged.<p>"If I didn't make this hole, I would have lost it!" the boy protested. Ranma surreptitiously palmed his own card, took off the chain, and stuffed it in his pocket. He did the same thing for the same reason.<p>"You should have just put it in your pocket!" the captain continued, not noticing Ranma's movements.<p>The other white-haired passenger, silent throughout the whole ordeal, turned away and went out the door commenting it was getting too loud. The brown-haired boy and the captain argued some more and the boy broke away saying he wanted to get a better view of Zion.<p>Ranma turned to the captain, "Hey old man, what kinda things are we gunna be piloting anyway? I was only told that I was a potential pilot candidate, and everyone assumed I knew what they were talkin about, y'know?"<p>The captain gave a smirk and simply said, "I'll just let you find out yourself, shall I? You will see soon enough."<p>The bespectacled boy got up and, saying he wanted to go see what the other two boys his age were up to, left the room. He still had a somewhat disbelieving look that Ranma didn't know what was going on, and that he was from another planet, which hadn't ever had outside contact with the rest of the universe. Ranma could see that in terms of technology, Earth technology was practically Stone Age.<p>"Well, anyway, uhh, I also had this kinda funny feeling when we came out here to space. Not sick, but I just feel kinda weird." he said finally into the silence.<p>The captain looked at him almost in the same exact way as he had with the younger boy. Ranma gulped.<p>"No! I mean...not that way. I mean...I can't explain it, but the gravity feels...weird. I mean...you guys must use some kind of artificial gravity or something, cause it don't just feel right. Maybe cause you guys have...I dunno...maybe you guys are used to some different gravity or something, even though I don't feel any lighter or heavier. I looked at your settings with the tech guy back when we just started, and he said it was the same gravity as what my planet is. Maybe it's just such a little change? After all, I am a Martial Artist...right?"<p>The captain could practically hear the capitals. He grinned, "It may be that, or you're just imagining things. What's a martial artist, anyway? It's not a term we've had much experience about."<p>"Oh? It's a form of unarmed combat. Back on my planet there were several styles that were eventually developed, mostly in Asia. It has been around for hundreds of generations. My family's Art is the best though, since it's the most unpredictable, and I'm the best of my family. I've been training since I was 5." The captain could see he was beginning to brag and decided to cut him off before his head swelled any further.<p>"Well, I'm sure that you're the best on YOUR planet, but we have some of the best training facilities and instructors that will put you in the dust. When you come in, you will probably be the worst in your age group, since you haven't had our style of training. So shut up and we'll see how good you think you are" He felt he was beginning to brag himself. The snotty kid was surely not as good as he claimed he was. Back home, probably, but not here. This was the REAL universe.<p>Ranma smirked, calculated to annoy the heck out of everyone. As suddenly as the smirk appeared, a frown of concentration soon replaced it. He felt something again. But it was different. Evil. Not like the old freak, but just malicious. And as suddenly, it felt like it exploded. He could FEEL the shockwave coming.<p>"Uhh, sir, you may wanna grab sumthin, cause we may be rocked a bit here." He shifted his stance a bit, and watched the captain, his back to the window.<p>"Huh?" was all the time the older man had to say when he saw the bright wave coming and barely had chance to grab a nearby chair when it hit. He lost his footing and stumbled into the chair. He looked up at Ranma and saw he hadn't budged an inch. He could feel the whole ship was still lurching around, but Ranma wasn't even leaning into the waves. It was like he had planted his feet into the deck and had a spine of reinforced steel for support. The ship rocked for a mere 2-3 seconds, but it seemed like 6-7. Finally, they were through the shockwave and the ship regained control. Hmm, perhaps this kid was better than he thought. The captain felt the beginnings of the same type of smirk that Ranma had worn just seconds before. He quickly schooled himself and got up. But something wasn't right. He thought back. Ranma hadn't even seen the waves coming; he just had a blank look then told him to grab something. He looked back behind him. Nope, there weren't any windows or monitors behind him. How did the kid know? He looked back at him.<p>"Uhh...what was that?"<p>"It probably was a Goddess's Verdict. It's the explosion that we usually get when the Goddesses destroy a Victim." The captain replied. He brushed himself off and looked back at the clipboard. Nope, the other candidates were fine as well. He looked up just in time to miss the spike of EX energy coming off from #88. Then it was gone.<p>He brought his watch up to his face and pressed a button as he spoke, "All candidates back to the cabin. We will be landing shortly and we DO have standards to maintain." He settled back.<p>The other candidates came back in after a while and the brown-haired boy immediately pressed his face once again into the window. The captain sighed. This was going to be a long day. As they came in to dock, he went to the bridge to finalize the final approach and docking procedures inside the immense GOA hanger. As the door slid shut behind him, he heard the boy change his mantra from repeatedly saying "Awesome!" into "GOA!"<p>When the captain left, Ranma turned to the others and introduced himself. "Hey, I guess I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Saotome Ranma, from Earth, candidate number 90."<p>"I'm Clay Cliff Fortran, candidate number 89. Pleased to meet you" the boy with the glasses responded, holding out his hand.<p>Ranma turned to the chanting boy and asked, "Hey, so what's your name? Hello? Hey! HEY!" he had to go up and shake his shoulder to get his attention.<p>The boy turned and said, "Can you believe it? This is GOA! I can't believe I'm finally HERE!" Ranma gave him a sharp blow to a pressure point to calm him down. It seemed as if it didn't have any effect at first, but eventually the boy started to talk coherently. "Oh, hi. How are you doing? Oh? You're Ranma? Hi, my name's Zero Enna. You can call me Zero." He winked then jauntily walked to the airlock.<p>*Whoo-boy, this guy's got a LOT of energy for him to keep running on what was still available when I hit his calming point.* Ranma thought worriedly *He's almost got as much as ME! Almost, mind. No one's gunna be better than Saotome Ranma. I'm the best there is, and the best there will ever be. Wonder if he's any good at Martial Arts. Wait, no one's ever even heard of Martial Arts here. Feh, there's gotta be SOME kinda fighting. Maybe some kind of kendo? That idiot Kuno stuck to the old forms too much, I'm sure they have different forms here since they must've developed differently* He began running through some of the routines that he knew and imagined fighting someone with a different style he didn't recognize. Mostly he visualized himself fighting someone that had a formless style like his. In simpler terms, this meant he was visualizing himself fighting himself. He hoped to get stiff competition. He didn't realize he hadn't asked the quiet white-haired boy with the ruby-red eyes.<p>Finally, the ship docked and they could disembark.
