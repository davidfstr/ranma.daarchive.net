</div>It's All In The Reflexes<p>A  Reflections Mini-Sequel</p><p>A. V.  Morgan</p><p>Part Ten</p><p>Tsu  Pai-Sei slipped his hand into the satchel hanging at his hip to confirm the  presence of the Kaisuifuu within, for what must have been the hundredth time  since he began his descent into the caverns deep beneath the Musk fortress. For  a man not inclined to nervous gestures, this spoke volumes about the agitation  and anticipation aroused in him by his quest. Long-lived though the imperial  dragon line was, it had been generations since a Musk emperor dared to confront  this particular dragon in its lair. Of course, he had been in the dragon's lair  many times over the centuries, but it made a significant difference to know  that this time he intended to wake it. Many times he had been tempted to risk  it, simply to see more clearly what the thick ice concealed. This time, not  only did he need to see the dragon clearly, he needed to beg its consultation.  To many, the legend of Tsin-Na Minh was a great fish story; a tale of the one  that had gotten away. In the way of such things, the third and fatal final  attempt by Prince Ergot to claim a bride was turned into a moral lesson to  instruct and guide generations of dragon princes in matters of pride and folly.</p><p>Spice had come close to writing his  own chapter in that story, as a young man. He had been utterly fascinated by  the dragon's story, and dreamed of being the man to claim it as his bride.  Fortunately, he had been distracted by the appearance of Saotome Kenshin. Spice  allowed himself a vicious grin. He had dragged that name out of the cursed boy  through a skillful application of pain and pleasure, insulted by the ridiculous  claim that he was THE Lo Shen of Musk legend. True, the appearance was correct,  down to the curse he possessed, but witnesses had reported that Lo Shen died in  childbirth and the Musk knew the identity of "her" only child, as  well as that of "her" grandchildren. Spice could guarantee that  Kenshin was not even a descendant of Lo Shen-however there was the possibility  Kenshin was descended directly from Pa Shen. Her ultimate fate was never known.  Spice would hardly be surprised to discover that she, at least, was still  lurking around. After all, Cinnamon had endured for fifteen hundred years, and  the last emperor to gaze upon "her" human face reported that  "she" seemed to have aged not at all-in comparison to the portrait  of Fa Shen.</p><p>Spice shuddered, remembering the  features of Saotome Nodoka. It had not been difficult to obtain confirmation  from agents in Japan that she was the daughter of Kenshin, but one look at her  face had been convincing enough. Unfortunately, that look had not been enough  to determine if she was also his daughter. It was disturbing that a set of  features-the crimson hair, the ocean eyes-that would be recessive in the  human genome were predominant in those descended from Pa Shen. Maybe seven or  eight generations down the line-as proven among the amazons-different, if  equally vibrant and extraordinary colorings eventually expressed themselves in  the descendants of those cursed in Fa Shen's image. Depending on how many  generations removed from Pa Shen this Kenshin had been, it was possible that  these persistent traits masked the animal traits that marked Spice and Herb as  dragon-spawn. Fortunately, the question would be much less ambiguous to a true  dragon, especially when it, or rather she, was the truest enduring portrait of  Fa Shen he knew of-with the possible exception of this Ranma that Herb had  informed him of.</p><p>When he first learned about the  martial arts prodigy, Spice could not have anticipated that the matter would  end up striking so close to home. Spice never suspected that Kenshin was  pregnant when "she" fled back to Japan with the Kaisuifuu. Thanks to  the amazons, he had been prevented from finding and capturing his  "bride" and when they later informed him of "her" death, he  had forced the matter from his mind. Lies and deceptions, he now knew, but it  was time to finally set matters straight. With the drop in air temperature, he  knew he was almost at his destination. The heart of the dragon's lair was  cavern entombed in ice. A kind of annex had been carved out of this  subterranean glacier, along with a shaft into which the kaisuifuu could be  slid. It would, as always, respond to the presence of water-regardless of  state-by heating up almost violently and melting the vast cocoon of ice.</p><p>As he carefully made his way into  the annex and pulled out the kettle, he smiled. If not for Kenshin appearing  and distracting Spice with his curse, and later stealing this key to the  dragon's crypt, he would have no doubt first confronted Cinnamon as a callous,  arrogant youth-young being a relative term, since Spice was still a young man  in appearance. Though several hundred years old by the time Kenshin appeared,  as little as forty years ago he had been no wiser than Herb and foolishly  confident of his ability to woo the rebellious dragon. With Kenshin, he had  only a man's pride to conquer, and failed miserably. The same failure with  Cinnamon would certainly have been fatal.</p><p>Spice had grown up more in that year  than in any hundred years previous. The failure broke his obsession with the  sleeping dragon and forced him to move on, find a mate and bear an heir. What  he did not learn because of Kenshin, marriage and fatherhood had provided. He  could be confident now that he approached the dragon untainted by foolish ambition.  He just hoped the answers it might provide did not reduce his son's options for  a suitable bride to the dragon itself.</p><p>Ranma had humbled Herb, but not  enough for him to court Cinnamon!</p><p>Letting the Kaisuifuu slide down the  shaft, into the womb of ice, he retreated to await the dragon's awakening. If  the records were correct, he had until the morning to compose himself and  phrase the request he needed to make. The hiss of steam and the thunderous  crack of ice was a strong testament to the veracity of past emperors' accounts.  It seemed the Kaisuifuu regarded the sheer mass of frozen water as both insult  and challenge, and the cavern began to glow with the ferocity with which it  replied. Titanic were the forces at magic's command, the searing heat of the kettle  caused steam to come boiling directly off the ice, building up incredible  pressure that ripped open great fissures in the frozen mantle, allowing the hot  gas to vent into the neighboring caverns- shaking the very foundations of the  mountain. Spice retreated with increasing haste. Suddenly, morning did not seem  far enough away.</p><p>Morning  arrived all too soon for more than just the Musk Emperor. The group of talented  young martial artists gathered under Cologne's roof met the new day with  grumbled complaints. Primarily because most of them had the dubious pleasure of  entering slumber through the judicious use of blunt force instruments, either  as the natural result of provoking Akane-as in the case of two known as  Ranko-or as the consequence of threatening the beauty sleep of a certain  amazon matriarch-as Shampoo, Ryouga, Ranma and Fa Shen discovered, when the  four of them met up at the front door and foolishly entered the house in a  turmoil of questions and quarrelling. Strangely, the last person to get to bed  had been Akane. After dispensing justice to Onna-Ranko and Otoko-Ranko, she had  grabbed her male counterpart and the bag of sea salt Po Shen left on the dining  room table, and marched off into the bath without a word to anyone. Clearly,  she had decided not to wait a week before putting herself back together, but no  one knew what had provoked her decision. In fact, certain individuals did not  even know about it yet, setting the stage for a classic opening shot by Ranma,  when he appeared at the breakfast table.</p><p>"Say, where's Akane?" he  asked blithely, while sitting down between Otoko-Akane and Ryouga. On Ryouga's  left sat Onna-Ranko, across from her, left to right, was Otoko-Ranko, Ukyo, Fa  Shen and Shampoo. Cologne and Nodoka were at the head and foot of the table, on  which the meal had already been laid out. In addition to not seeing Onna-Akane,  Mousse was missing too, but before he could voice that observation as well,  Akane reacted.</p><p>"What! Are you BLIND!"  the youngest Tendo shouted, while crowning Ranma with a cast iron skillet. Both  Rankos and Fa Shen automatically swept their plates through the air to rescue  flying food.</p><p>Ranma winced and rubbed the top of  his head while wiggling his little finger in the ear facing Akane to combat the  ringing. His siblings bowed their heads respectfully in relief that no food was  spoiled, while Shampoo and Ukyo glared at Akane out of habit. Everyone cringed  as Ranma once more proved impervious to negative reinforcement.</p><p>"Geez, even as a guy you're  such a tomboy," he huffed indignantly.</p><p>"Where's your girl half?"  Ranko quickly interjected, in stereo.</p><p>Akane paused in mid-mallet, and  blinked, flustered by the reflexive impulse to look at the speaker and finding  his attention torn between the boy and girl sitting across from each other at  the table. After a second, his mallet faded out of sight and he shrugged.  "I'm not split like that any more."</p><p>"You're not? But I  thought…" Onna-Ranko began, exchanging a look with her male half, who  simply shrugged.</p><p>"Yeah, I know. Part of me could  still be normal that way, but…" Akane looked down in discomfort. He  studied his hands for a moment, and continued, "After our fight last  night, I got worried. I mean, what would happen to my girl half if I had a  surge of defiance? If I'm not split, the real me is still in here  somewhere," he patted his chest meaningfully. "I didn't want to take  any chances. Besides, I can handle being stuck like this for a week. I AM a  martial artist, you know!"</p><p>Most of the others at breakfast gave  her a sympathetic look, or rolled their eyes at the characteristic rejoinder,  but no one knew what to say. None of them had really expected to see the male  Akane again, after their recent visit to Jusenkyo. The temporary curse had worn  off and Ranko had splashed Akane with the chisuiiton for extra protection. No  one imagined that what had happened to Ryouga could happen to any of the rest  of them.</p><p>"That was probably a wise  decision," Cologne finally offered. Short tempered and stubborn, Akane  would have been tempting fate had he remained divided. The old amazon did not  know if the chi-curse could have activated while it was divided-a normal curse  could not have-but why take the risk? "I should advise you, remain  vigilant. Do not attempt any chi attacks until we find a way to purge your  aura. I am sure you do not wish to have a twins curse anymore than you wanted  to have a boy curse, Akane."</p><p>There was a round of shudders.</p><p>"As it happens, however, I  think there is a solution for you and Ryouga that does not involve you using  actual combat techniques," Cologne added. "From what I have seen, the  ghost of a curse-yes, I'm making this up as I go!" Cologne interrupted  herself to address the sudden suspicion of her teen audience, as it suddenly  occurred to them that her explanations were always a bit too convenient and  always too late. Clearing her throat and glaring, she continued, "A curse  that has been shed into the chi mantle-more simply, the ghost of a  curse-needs to be charged and released in order to infect someone. Ryouga has  not thrown a shishihokodan since he was infected, yet he transforms when hit  with a surge of depression." Cologne held out a hand and fired off a small  ball of sickly green chi. When it hit Ryouga, he vanished into his clothes with  a squeal of indignation. Cologne smirked, "As you see, it is the type of  energy that triggers the curse. The opposite energy…"</p><p>"I get it! Mokotakabisha!"  Ranma impulsively shot off a burst of confident chi, which splashed over Ryouga  just as the piglet was struggling through the neck of his shirt. The shocked  boy struggled to slide his arms out through the sleeves as he suddenly reverted  to humanity. "Yatta!" Ranma jumped up and danced around, "I can  cure you! Now you can work on mastering your girl curse!" Ryouga eeped and  struggled to get back into his boxers and pants without flashing anyone,  blushing furiously.</p><p>"Well, that proved remarkably  simple," Cologne quipped.</p><p>"Yeah. That means there's got  to be a catch to it, somehow," Ukyo sighed, setting down her teacup.  Actually, the catch seemed pretty obvious. A ki adept could control Ryouga's  pig curse, or exploit it in battle. Even if Ryouga mastered both curses, the  pig curse would always be a stumbling block. Ukyo wondered if she should point  this out or not. There was a grim look to her as she stole another look at  Ranma and Ryouga, across the table from her. She could easily picture things  coming to a head with her fighting Ryouga over Ranma. There was still a part of  Ukyo that wanted to reclaim her womanhood. A part that surged forth whenever  Ranma reverted to his birth form and familiar bone-headed behavior. Not that it  was easy to reconcile this morning's Ranma, the boy she fell in love with, with  the Ranma of last night, who was every inch a young woman in love with Ryouga.  Honestly, Ukyo had been surprised to see both of them show up to breakfast in  male form. Narrowing her eyes, she asked Ranma pointedly, "Say, did you  and Ryouga sleep in the same room last night?"</p><p>Ranma blinked in surprise as  everyone fell silent at her question. Giving everyone a look, he shrugged and  casually declared, "I guess so. I mean, I was in the guys' room when I  woke up, so I guess someone put me in there when we all got knocked out."</p><p>Akane spoke up, "That was me.  After I put Ranko in bed, I discovered the rest of you unconscious so I dragged  you all upstairs. Ranko takes up two futons now, but Mousse was gone, so I  borrowed his."</p><p>"Whatever," Ukyo waved  Akane's interruption off without breaking eye contact with Ranma. "You and  Ryouga slept in the same room last night-ALONE?" Ukyo demanded with more  asperity.</p><p>"Well, duh! I just said, Mousse  didn't come in last night!" Akane growled.</p><p>"Er… yeah, Duck-boy wasn't here  this morning," Ranma confirmed.</p><p>"Right, so you had the room to  yourselves all night." Ukyo set down her chopsticks and crossed her arms  before voicing her aggrieved consternation, "How come you are both  guys?"</p><p>"Huh? Don't you remember?  Ryouga got some hot water when we came in last night," Ranma reminded  acerbically.</p><p>"Yes. I also remember you  didn't change," Ukyo nodded before scowling and leveling an accusing  finger. "So, if you went to bed with Ryouga as a girl, why would you be a  boy when you got up?" Ukyo seemed just shy of retching, and visibly  shuddered. Akane looked mortified, mentally kicking herself for thinking  nothing of putting Ranma and Ryouga in a room together. Long used to ignoring  the state of Ranma's curse and dealing with him always as a boy, she had  automatically been treating Ryouga the same. It had not occurred to her that it  had become improper for them to sleep together.</p><p>"Duh! I obviously changed in my  sleep! What did you think hap-" Ranma tipped over in shock as he realized  what Ukyo thought had happened. Ranma picked himself up from the floor and  shouted, while everyone else feigned deep fascination with their breakfast,  "Damn it! Why is it two people can't sleep together without people  thinkin' they're sleepin' TOGETHER!" The hand gestures accompanying this  outburst proved too much for Nodoka, who produced the most unusual permutation  of a squeak, choked, and sprayed tea from her nose.</p><p>The Saotome siblings, at present  numbering four, all stared at their mother, stunned by this unprecedented loss  of composure from the perpetually poised paragon of feminine propriety.  "Mom? Are you okay?" Ranko and Ranko asked, just barely beating out  Ranma and Fa Shen.</p><p>Nodoka, for her part, was doubly  embarrassed. It was not as if she had not been warned by Fa Shen the night  before, but she had made the unfortunate mistake of picturing the liaison Ukyo  was implying, while quietly lamenting the outcome of the man-among-men pledge.  "That was certainly NOT what I intended!" she muttered to herself, as  she hid behind a napkin and demurely tried to void tea from her nasal cavity.  When she felt able to speak normally, she cleared her throat, "I'm fine,  children. Really, Ukyo, that was hardly appropriate for the breakfast  table!"</p><p>"Sorry," Ukyo bowed her  head.</p><p>Nodoka accepted the apology with a  matronly nod, then turned a measuring eye on Ranma. Because of her adoption by  Cologne, Nodoka had been acquainting herself with amazon law. Given that, and  what she had learned the previous night, it was a wonder she had gotten any  sleep at all. Clearing her throat, she inquired, "I suppose it's no use  trying to ignore things at this point. I believe there was something you needed  to tell me, Ranma-chan?"</p><p>Ranma gulped, managing not to choke  only by virtue of the fact he swallowed his food as fast as he shoveled it into  his mouth. His eyes met his mother's for a long moment, during which he  gradually changed into a girl. She could almost map the mental process that  forced the change, starting with the implicit understanding of what Nodoka was  referring to. "Mom, I-" she began, but could not find words to  continue. Ukyo had hinted last night that the cat was already out of the bag,  and Nodoka's prompting confirmed it. Taking a deep breath, she pled, "I  can explain."</p><p>"In a way, you already  have," Nodoka admitted, referring to Fa Shen's personality shift,  disclosing the situation to Akane as Ranma. "Please do not be  afraid," she begged in a heart-torn voice. "I simply wish to  understand what is happening with my so- my child, and find out if- if- or  rather," she hated the fact that she was so rattled. Trying another tack,  she confided, "I have been studying amazon law. Are you aware of- of the  consequences- of the obligations you face by recognizing what you and your f-  fr- friend have done?"</p><p>Ranma stared back, terror subsiding  as the sight of her mother's discomfort perversely restored her composure.  Taking a sip of tea and then clearing her throat, she tested, "You mean,  do I know that we're married by amazon law?" Nodoka nodded, flushing. Ranma  looked at Ryouga and sighed. "I still think they're stupid laws. I don't  think I'm ready to be married. Hell, I mean, I'm the bride for cryin' out loud,  and there's a big difference between bein' a girl and bein' a-well, GIRL, I  guess. I'm more of a tomboy."</p><p>Nodoka studied her  "daughter's" face for a long moment.</p><p>"I remember the choice you gave  me," Ranma stated firmly, looking very determined and a faint bit  insecure. Motherhood was an implicit consequence of choosing to be female. That  was still frightening, but it was something Ranma could cope with because Fa  Shen had been prepared for the possibility. "I understand the obligations  I have, because of the choice I made. The only thing I didn't know was that I  already made the choice. I can't live with myself if I try to deny that."</p><p>Nodoka nodded distantly. Her  thoughts were well over the horizon, debating matters of honor and family,  weighing the remaining options and obligations. Her eyes drifted over to  Ryouga, who sat rigid, hope, fear and desperation warring beneath the surface,  while studying Ranma at his side. He had such unfortunate short-comings, but  then so had Genma. He had a sense of honor, misguided though it seemed to have  often been. He seemed to possess a passionate nature and obviously loved Ranma  very much. He was a skilled and manly martial artist. Most importantly, he  shared Ranma's curse. Having learned how the curse had scarred her children,  shattered the boundaries of gender, she could not keep from thinking how  difficult it would be for them to find happiness in a relationship with a  normal person. Ranma could certainly do worse.</p><p>Nodoka spared a glance at Akane, not  surprised to find the recently made boy studying Fa Shen shyly. There was  another who had made his mark on her children, and been tarred with the same  brush. The interaction between Akane and the version of Ranma that came from  within Fa Shen had given her some hope that the Saotome-Tendo pact might be  salvaged.</p><p>Nodoka did not even bother to look  at Ukyo. She was painfully aware of the situation there. She had heard the  confessions and confusion of the chef and the triplets by turns, and knew the  girl would give up her womanhood entirely before giving up her claim to  Ranma-she would certainly give that up in order to secure her claim to Ranko.  How odd and frightening to see an individual claim that a path of disaster and  tragedy was the only one leading to happiness.</p><p>Returning her gaze to Ranma, she  realized why she could not complain about Ranma's fate. She had chosen it herself.  In a sense, it was the final proof of Ranma's manhood. Taking a deep breath,  she nodded formally and declared, "Then I shall recognize you openly and  formally as my daughter. As such, there are certain conditions I must set, and  certain obligations you will have to meet."</p><p>Ranma bowed, "I  understand."</p><p>Nodoka offered a sad smile.</p><p>As  confrontations went, the words exchanged between Ranma and Nodoka were  deceptively reassuring. In spite of the calm and reasonable tones in which the  mother and daughter came to an understanding, a thick tension hung in the air  over the remainder of breakfast. As careful as they had been to skirt the  lingering threat of fatal consequences that once defined the relationship  between Ranma and Nodoka, there remained a sense of a ticking time-bomb ready  to detonate at the slightest provocation. Ranko found herself, and her  counterpart, glancing at Akane between subdued bites. It disturbed Ranko that  the tomboy had not blown up over Ranma's defection. From the way Akane kept studying  Fa Shen, Ranko decided that she had missed something important last night.  Meeting the eyes of her male half, Ranko caught a hint of the same concern, but  there were other things going on in his mind that she was not aware of. She  felt a sudden surge of annoyance over their separation.</p><p>There was really only one thing she  could think of that was worth being split in two like this, and because this  was the result of an instant curse, she could not afford to indulge in it. Part  of her was desperately ashamed about her growing obsession with sex, and part  of her found the notion of literally screwing herself-as that seemed the only  safe option available-obscene, but neither those concerns, nor the risk of  being permanently split, was enough to erase the temptation. So, the rational  part of her warned her to avoid her other half, which got the irrational parts  of her mind worked up over the fact that she was shut out of whatever went on  in his head. She tried to tell herself she just wanted to talk with the one  person she ought to have a perfect understanding with-conveniently ignoring  that the same rule applied to Ranma and Fa Shen-but really she just had an  itch to drag him off somewhere alone.</p><p>Ranko noticed that she was staring  at him too intently when he began to blush, but refused to look away. Ranko  closed her eyes and sighed heavily. The only naked activity she should indulge  in with him was a hot bath in salt water. Anything else would just invite more  chaos. Forcing her attention back to Ranma, she decided it would be best to  confide in her and try to draw Ranma out in turn. The changes Ranma was going  through were setting off alarms in Ranko's head. She did not know what exactly  was wrong, but the landslide was far from over and she did not want to be  buried alive when things finally settled down for good. She also decided to put  her other half on Fa Shen, get him to dig out whatever had come up between her  and Akane-and conveniently put some distance between herself and him. Ranko  conveniently failed to notice how quickly she had shied away from the part  about curing her temporary twins curse.</p><p>As the meal ended, Ranko nudged her  other self and suggested he talk to Fa Shen. The look he gave her before  nodding told her his train of thought had not run very far from hers. She gave  him a wry smile and then turned to spot Ranma. She frowned as she noticed their  mother leaning over to speak privately to Ranma, disturbed by the fact that the  disclosure was making Ranma squirm. As Ranko paused to wait, Nodoka turned to  see who was approaching and smiled.</p><p>Ranko gulped at the look on her  mother's face.</p><p>"Ah, Ranko, this applies to you  as well," she announced, gesturing for Ranko to accompany her as she led  Ranma out into the garden. Once they were far enough from the house for  privacy, Nodoka continued, "As I was just mentioning to Ranma, I have been  giving a great deal of thought to the matter of my daughters."</p><p>Ranko resisted the urge to flinch  and hold up warding gestures. "Oh?" she squeaked, trying to sound  casual. She pasted a sickly smile on her face as she hoped she was not about to  hear what she expected to hear.</p><p>"Yes. Now, I am well aware that  your past experiences are, well, rather extraordinary. I can accept at this  point that you are truly both male and female. However… I might as well confess  that I find little fault with your masculinity. You two seem to be a pair of  fine young men, when you want to be. However, not even Fa Shen is what I would  call entirely feminine," Nodoka declared with a hint of despondence.  Nodoka tried not to feel too discouraged by the girls' twitching eyes.  "Now, as I have said, I would be happy to recognize you as my daughters,  but I assure you, any daughter of mine has to meet certain standards. Seeing the  situation Ranma-chan has gotten herself into… Oh, my dear child, you have no  idea how astute your comment was, about not being ready to be a bride! At least  I was able to make a start with Ranko, but truly it is well past time you three  were taught how to be proper young ladies."</p><p>"Ah…" Ranma and Ranko  blurted, stunned.</p><p>"Oh dear!" Nodoka broke  off, startled by the sound of a body exploding out through the kitchen roof and  hurtling up into the sky.</p><p>"What did I doooo…!" Fa  Shen demanded as she sailed over head.</p><p>"Ba-a-ka!" Akane shouted,  storming out of the house, glaring at the girl diminishing to a speck as she  rocketed up into the sky. As he passed Nodoka, and encountered the disbelieving  stares of Ranma and Onna-Ranko, he paused and snarled at the teens, "What  are you staring at?"</p><p>Nodoka cleared her throat and  smoothed down her kimono. "Akane-chan, is it your intention to marry Fa  Shen?" she asked sweetly, giving the "young man" before her an  appreciative, measuring look.</p><p>Akane almost choked, anger and embarrassment  warring for control, retorting, "It's not like that! She was asking for  it!" Ranma slapped a hand over her mouth, to contain a bark of laughter,  and faded behind her mother. Words like "irony" and "poetic  justice" came to mind, as Ranma's eternal protest was quoted by Akane.  Better to just stand back and enjoy it, rather than risk provoking Nodoka or  Akane further by rubbing it in.</p><p>Onna-Ranko's attention was locked on  the dwindling form of Fa Shen, apprehension etched on her face, as Otoko-Ranko  marched out and pointed at Akane, "Is that how you thank someone for  trying to help you out!" He raised an eyebrow at the sight of Onna-Ranma  clapping a second hand over her mouth and abruptly bending over, before  refocusing on Akane, who was whipping around to meet his accusation.</p><p>"Help me out!" Akane  raged, "Who said I needed any help from a bunch of sex-crazed perverts  like you!" Fortunately, his back was now turned toward Nodoka and her  daughters, and he was too worked up to pay much attention to the smothered  noises coming from Ranma-as she struggled to contain riotous laughter and a  grunt of pain from taking an elbow in the ribs from Onna-Ranko.</p><p>"Hey, if you wanna be a guy for  the rest of your life…" Otoko Ranko let his retort trail off with an  exaggerated shrug and dismissive wave. Catching sight of Ranma on the edge of  his vision, squeezing her knees together as she remained bent over by her  strange convulsions, it suddenly clicked that his sibling was not about to lose  her breakfast. Having no idea what set Ranma off, his irritation swelled in the  belief that she was laughing at him. While this added fuel to his temper,  Akane's retort promised a real spark of ignition.</p><p>"Like I'd have a choice with  what you two were planning…!"</p><p>"Hold it!" Onna-Ranko  interrupted, pushing between the two boys, as they surged forward to get in  each other's faces. She had moved the instant her finely tuned senses informed  her that the argument was on the verge of becoming a real fight. Thankfully,  Nodoka had noticed Ranma's convulsions and pulled her off to the side, giving  Ranko a bit of room. Shoving Otoko-Ranko and Akane apart and keeping a hand  square in the middle of each of their chests, she demanded, "What are you  fighting about?" She turned her face to Akane and chastised, "How  could you go and attack Fa Shen like that!"</p><p>"If you only heard what she was  saying, Ranko! She really, really was asking for it this time!" Akane  heaved a breath and glared at Otoko-Ranko, "As for HIM… This idiot was  encouraging Fa Shen to claim me as a husband!"</p><p>"Are you insane!"  Otoko-Ranko snapped. There was silence from the sidelines, as Ranma and Nodoka  paused in their quiet exchange to stare over in surprise. Nodoka's challenge to  Akane had been in jest, but if Fa Shen did have an interest in the engagement  to Akane, this could not be ignored! They shared a stunned look and scrambled  to their feet as the red-headed boy demanded, "Where did you get that  idea!"</p><p>"Stop it," Ranko shook her  other self, drawing his eyes to her. Turning to Akane she tried to point out  calmly, "Akane, after yesterday, all Fa Shen has to do is kiss you and  you'd be hers, especially with you like this right now."</p><p>"I KNOW that!" Akane  fumed, "But, I didn't think she really would. Until I heard her talking to  this idiot about how to make me submissive and compliant and aroused at the  same time!"</p><p>Ranko felt her eyes bulging, and  whipped her head around to stare at her other half, "I thought Fa Shen  didn't like submissive guys!"</p><p>Otoko-Ranko blinked at both of them.  A distant whistling sound rising in pitch and volume started to tickle the back  of everyone's mind. His eyes narrowed on Akane, "You dope, you don't know  what you're talking about! You got it totally wrong!"</p><p>Akane lurched forward, hands fisting  in preparation to deliver his retort. "Oh? Is that so?"</p><p>"Oh, like you have any clue  what was going on before you jumped in!"</p><p>Onna-Ranko braced her feet and  pushed them apart again before she became squashed between them. Part of her  mind was screaming about the significance of the increasingly piercing whistle,  but she brushed that distraction aside. Giving her other half a shake, she  demanded, "Would you just… Tell ME what was going on."</p><p>"Huh? Oh, well, Fa Shen was  trying to work out a way to reverse Akane's curse during breakfast, and she was  going over it with me when Akane burst into the kitchen and booted her out the  window. She figured out a couple of things that were the opposite of defiance,  but we didn't know how someone could generate a 'compliant' or 'submissive'  battle aura…" Otoko-Ranko began to summarize, as the ballistic screech  peaked. Everyone jumped at the distant report of exploding rock and shouts of  alarm from the terminus of Fa Shen steep, acute trajectory. "Oh shit,"  Otoko-Ranko blurted and raced off.</p><p>The others followed in his wake,  soon arriving at the edge of the village where they found Fa Shen lying  unconscious amidst the rubble of shattered boulders that had evidently broken  the red-headed amazon's fall. As they shoved through the crowd that had  gathered around the crash site, a number of amazon warriors seized Akane  grimly.</p><p>"You not run away this  time!" one of the warriors asserted fiercely.</p><p>"This gone far enough,"  another woman warrior agreed, nodding.</p><p>"Oh no," Onna-Ranko moaned  in concert with Ranma and Otoko-Ranko. As headstrong as Akane usually was, none  of them had really expected him to have learned from the previous day's  misadventures. The problem had only gotten worse with Akane turning into a boy,  but it had not occurred to them until now that Akane had forgotten how her male  form increased her already inhuman strength. Even Fa Shen must have  underestimated the power of Akane's blow, if she failed to properly compensate  for the force of her landing. But really, the worst thing of all was the fact  that it was FA SHEN laying unconscious before them. Where Ranma would hesitate,  Fa Shen would have only two choices when she regained consciousness, and the  "honor guard" that had seized Akane would force her to make it.</p><p>It was like watching a train wreck  as Fa Shen's eyes fluttered and opened. She lay there restraining the groan  that wanted to come out. There was a moment of confusion as she took in the  watching crowd, and tried to determine how and why she had lost consciousness.  The drain on her reserves, from reinforcing her body mightily with ki, and the  jarred memory of rocky ground hurtling towards her suggested recent combat.  Then her gaze focused on Akane. There was an audible gasp, and her eyes snapped  shut for an instant in disbelief.</p><p>A flood of conflicting emotions  stormed across her delicate features, as she tried to decide what to do. Sheer  habit set her to motion, picking herself up and dusting herself off slowly  while she studied Akane through narrow eyes.</p><p>Her mind ticked rapidly through all  of the options facing her. Should she treat Akane as the outsider female she  was in truth? Should she go along with the idea of Akane being a man at heart  and accept her defeat, even if Akane's beatings were a bit too one sided to be  called combat? Should she reveal her "marriage" to Shampoo in the  hopes of dodging this mess? She shook her head, the elders would probably force  her to honor both marriages, since an amazon and an outsider were both involved.</p><p>But, could she even hold on to being  Fa Shen if she was married to Akane? If she reverted to being Ranma,  permanently, could she cope with being Akane's WIFE? For that matter, could  Akane even deal with being her HUSBAND? Was this, finally, sufficient justification  to rebel against her tribe?</p><p>Fa Shen felt a shiver run through  her and take up residence in her gut. Her mother had defied the tribe, but she  had not been born an amazon. The part of her that was Ranma had been screaming  for defiance of amazon law from the very beginning. Her siblings had tolerated  their induction into the tribe in part because they had assimilated Fa Shen to  a greater or lesser degree, but mostly for the sake of Fa Shen herself.</p><p>If she rebelled, they would back her  up, and together they were powerful enough to cow the elders, even if they did  not resort to using their circuit. Fa Shen paused for a heartbeat, thinking  about the upheavals she and her siblings kept going through. She scowled  deeply, fighting to contain the shakes resonating outward from her gut. They  were more fragile right now than they realized, and they had weaknesses the  elders could easily exploit. This was not the time for them to go to war with  the elders. Was it worth it to resist something that she already had an  obligation to do? Part of her, the part that was Ranma, was bound by the  engagement to Akane. If Fa Shen cut her ties to the tribe, her only surviving  ties to her past, would she even have a reason to remain Fa Shen? It would be  pretty stupid to start a war over something that would most likely happen  anyway if she burned those bridges.</p><p>During her deliberation, Fa Shen had  schooled her features to mask her intentions and forced her oddly weakening  limbs to maintain a pose of strength and confidence. She did not have anything  to spare on regrets. The moment of truth was at hand, no matter how much she  wished that Akane had listened and taken responsibility for his actions just  for once. In spite of literally cursing himself, though, Akane had not gained the  slightest emotional discipline. Would he remain true to form and lay the blame  for this fiasco on her? It did not really matter. Fighting to maintain her  poise, she stepped forward at last and reached up a hand to cup Akane's cheek.</p><p>There was a gasp as Fa Shen seemed  to lean in to kiss Akane's cheek, but instead of a kiss of death, the amazon  whispered something directly into Akane's ear. Akane stiffened, and his eyes  flooded over with sudden tears that spilled over as Fa Shen pulled back, kissed  him on the mouth, and proclaimed, "Wo de Airen."</p><p>There was instant celebration among  the native witnesses, but Nodoka and her children stood silent as Akane and Fa  Shen embraced in silence, the red-headed girl's body now visibly trembling. Fa  Shen had buried her face in Akane's chest, and the neo-boy was just staring off  into nowhere, shock and grief inexplicably stamped on his face as he numbly  held onto her. He could not see or hear the people around them. He kept hearing  the words Fa Shen had whispered, "Please do not fight this. If I had an  option that allowed both of us to survive, I would have taken it." For  once, Akane found it impossible to misinterpret what he had heard. He just did  not want to believe it.</p><p>Herb was  initially quite put off when a contingent of his father's guard arrived with a  command for him to meet with his father. They had arrived just as Herb was  about to leave camp to visit the amazon village. It was just like his father to  give new orders that contradicted and frustrated his standing orders to claim a  Saotome triplet for a bride. It grated even worse that the new orders amounted  to a fool's errand in Herb's mind. Of course, immediately upon arriving at the  entrance to the cavern where he was instructed to deliver a change of clothes  to Spice, his irritation turned into confused fascination. It had been  something of a shock to find his father leading a naked young woman into the  sunlight, particularly when at first glance Herb identified her as one of the  Saotome women. A second glance revealed that she was a bit too tall to be  Ranma, Ranko or Fa Shen, and yet too young to be their mother. His curiosity  got the better of him as the girl slipped on the clothes he had brought.</p><p>"I assume she is the reason you  called on me for such a menial task," Herb prompted, managing to vent his  ire while leaving little room for retaliation.</p><p>Spice gave his son a dark, measuring  look. In an imperious tone, he lectured, "I should not need to enlighten  you to the honor I've allowed you, were you to consider your history lessons.  Does the significance of this place, and the person I have roused here, truly  escape you, my Son?"</p><p>Herb took another look at the  nyanniichuan victim, and narrowed his eyes. He certainly knew the legends of  his people inside and out, and his father's reprisal had stripped away all  possible doubt about who this woman was-or more importantly, what she was.  Quickly putting together what had happened, he allowed himself an evil smile,  while asking innocently, "I see. In order to find out if the mother of  Ranma is your daughter, you decided to consult the nearest full-blooded dragon.  Naturally, she needs appropriate attire to walk among humans. Which I am sure  you realized before turning her human. So, seeing as you neglected to bring any  with you… I trust you have been enjoying the view?"</p><p>Spice blushed furiously, a mixture  of fury and embarrassment at his son's baiting. It was small vengeance for the  times Spice forced Herb to remain in female form to "give an old man's  eyes something pleasant to linger on". His discomfort increased as the  dragon leveled an eye on his back.</p><p>To prove the sharpness of her ears,  she interrupted, "Though I suspect the same intent, knowing Musk men for  the beasts they are, the truth is he left the clothes he brought for me in my  nest, where they were ruined by the melting process." She threw a damp and  shrunken garments at Herb to illustrate her point, catching the prince by  surprise as they plastered themselves over his noble profile.</p><p>Peeling the clothes away from his  face, Herb noted that they were reduced to a size suitable for a girl of maybe  six or seven.</p><p>"I noticed you do not have shy  eyes, youngling," the dragon accused Herb pointedly, smoothing her hands  over the outfit she was now wearing, one of the prince's royal, white, silk  outfits. It was an excellent fit, for her height, and certainly hung on her  body better than it would on Herb's female form, but it remained quite  obviously a masculine garment.</p><p>Herb smirked, "I assure you I  am all too familiar with female anatomy." Between adjusting to his own  alternate form, and the training he had undertaken to prepare for the conquest  of Ranma-before learning about Fa Shen-he was now quite impervious to the  sight of nude women, especially those cast in Fa Shen's image. "As it  happens, I was simply surprised by the subtler differences in your form. If you  were human, I'd guess you to be about nineteen."</p><p>Cinnamon scowled in faint confusion.  "So, you are quite used to ogling women's bodies?" she tried to  interpret Herb's declarations. Before Herb could say a word, however, Spice  splashed his son from the canteen he was drinking from. Cinnamon's eyebrows  rose as she took in the appearance of the girl suddenly before her. "I…  see. So, here we have it. Evidence of karma and the repetition of history all  rolled in one. Extraordinary," she smiled. Then she shrugged it off,  "No matter then. As I am sure you've learned, you cannot stop men from  looking, since even the threat of death is sometimes not enough to keep them  from actually touching."</p><p>"Prince, dragon or emperor,  none are beyond the accursed springs' power to humble," Spice intoned,  taking a serious air as he put his canteen away and gathered his pack. It did  not escape him that the dragon's comment was a warning. The understated threat  was actually reassuring, both as a confirmation of his initial suspicions and  as an indication of her present disposition. Looking at Cinnamon, he asked,  "Are you ready?"</p><p>Cinnamon tilted her head,  considering the story she had been told after her awakening, as she and the  emperor awaited the arrival of his son. It seemed impossible that what he  claimed could be true, even if the myths and legends surrounding the pools of  sorrow spoke true-but if there was even a chance, it might mean the end of her  self imposed exile. "I am more than ready. Take me to the others. I am  eager to see if Fa Shen is truly resurrected," she declared. She fell into  step behind Spice and Herb, as the dragon "princess" finished  squeezing water out of her shirt, and the three of them made their way towards  Herb's camp. There, they would pick up their entourage and proceed to the  amazon village. Cinnamon tuned out the conversation between the father and  female son and tried to soak in the world around her while sorting out her  thoughts.</p><p>Being awakened had always been  somewhat traumatic. Consciousness began returning to her even before the ice  began to melt. The mere approach of Spice had been enough to draw her  attention. The presence of any intruder would, but he had visited her tomb many  times over the years. She had recognized him as distant kin, and tasted the  familiar intentions as his mind contemplated awakening her. It had been a while  since such a man had contemplated her conquest, and part of her had actually  longed for the diversion. The temptation had drawn him to the threshold of her  nest two or three times a century, but always he had resisted. She had begun to  feel a kind of fondness for him because of his restraint. Strangely, as age  finally began to make a mark on him, he abandoned his obsession. Herb was  explanation enough for that. She might have guessed it from the last visit he  made, prior to this awakening. Thought it seemed to take forever, the boy who  had been her only contact with the world for several hundred years had finally  become a man.</p><p>That was why it surprised her to  feel him return. To feel the strength of his intention to wake her and realize  he really meant it this time. Most importantly, she tasted something his  predecessors had lacked, humility and respect. While no more inclined than ever  to be a Musk bride, she did anticipate a most interesting dance would ensue. He  would make a fine opponent, but he had surprised her yet again. Of course, he  was surprised himself when he entered her lair to find her swimming in the  heated water in her present form. As she climbed out of the underground lake  carrying the kettle that had created it, he had stammered in disbelief.</p><p>"How can you be in this form,  the Kaisuifuu…"</p><p>"Can no more unlock a mastered  curse than the Chisuiiton can lock one," she had replied sweetly. Taking  in his shocked expression, she had laughed, lecturing teasingly, "Once  mastered, a curse is effectively broken and the change becomes an innate ability-the  form as true to the individual as the one they were born to. Surely you did not  think a dragon could be locked in a cursed form and not inevitably master  it?"</p><p>"But, there is no record…"</p><p>"There can be no record of a  secret if it is properly kept. As for why I kept it a secret in the first  place?" she anticipated his question and was rewarded by his eager look.  Cinnamon smiled, "Put simply, it amused me to let the last man who tried  to claim me believe he had some power over me. It makes the game much more  interesting. As you have the wisdom to recognize I am not to be trifled with, I  see no need to treat you like a fool."</p><p>Spice stared at her a moment before  blinking in confusion. It flustered him deeply to be spoken to in the tones of  an equal-or even those of a superior in a favorable mood-by a woman. He had  to force himself to remember that, appearances aside, this was a full-blooded  dragon. "I beg your pardon," he schooled himself sternly, bowing.  "I had prepared myself to see you in your full glory. I should have  anticipated you would appear as you see fit."</p><p>"As it happens, you ARE seeing  me in my full glory, as this is hardly sufficient to conceal it," she  quipped, kicking the pile of clothes she had fished out before his arrival.  When he moved to offer her his cloak, she waved it off. "That is not  necessary. I am not that fond of clothing anyway, so you might as well enjoy  the view until it is necessary for me to dress."</p><p>To her amusement, that actually  seemed to embarrass him.</p><p>"You surprise me. You do not  act like a man intent on conquest," she prodded. While this provoked him,  the result was not what he expected. He quickly disavowed any intention of  wooing her, explaining his real reasons for awakening her. In the process, he  told the story of Kenshin Saotome and the tragic outcome of his bid for a mate,  and the deception that concealed the existence of a potential daughter until  now. "So, that is all you desire of me? To see this woman born of the  Nyanniichuan?"</p><p>"I need to know before my son  claims one of her offspring for a wife," he clarified, filling in  additional details about Ranma, Ranko and Fa Shen. "So, after you, these  are the best bridal candidates available to my son. It would be… awkward… to  discover they might themselves already be my heirs."</p><p>Cinnamon had listened to every  detail, but the shock of hearing about the resurrection of Fa Shen left her  brain virtually incapacitated. If there was a human who had made a greater  impact on the dragon's life than Ergot, it could only be Fa Shen. The dragon  had been obsessed with the girl even before being cursed in her image. At one  point, driven almost insane by the bizarre fascination and attraction she held  for Cinnamon, he-at the time-had gone so far as to try and eat her. Even now  it bewildered Cinnamon. Fa Shen just had a- an irresistible taste. An arousing  flavor that permeated the dragon every moment she wore the girl's form. As this  quality lingered in her own curse, it had existed in the cursed girl Ergot had  used as bait to capture and curse Cinnamon.</p><p>It was through Lo Shen that Cinnamon  had first learned anything of the person Fa Shen had been, beginning with the  fact of her demise. Cinnamon arranged for Lo Shen to pay the price for hi- her  part in Fa Shen's death, but took full vengeance on Ergot for slaying the  object of Cinnamon's obsession. Cinnamon had believed that her curse was all  she could ever have of the girl that still haunted her desires. Ironically, her  absolute embrace of her curse had proven the key to mastering it-the means to  make the girl a part of her, for all she adhered to her true nature as a  dragon.</p><p>But, Fa Shen's form had never given  her an answer to the original question. What did she want from Fa Shen to begin  with? Instinct said she wanted to merge with Fa Shen, but not even embracing  the curse had not satisfied that desire. It had not been until she had fully  adapted to her adopted humanity that she realized she had desired to mate with  Fa Shen, in spite of the fact that she was a human girl and Cinnamon was in  truth a male dragon. Of course, the realization came too late. When Pa Shen  came to rescue her son-turned-daughter, Cinnamon realized she too sparked the  same longing. Again, the realization was too late. Pa Shen quickly learned of  Cinnamon's part in Lo Shen's fatal pregnancy, and nothing could sate the  mother's enraged hatred. Cinnamon could not understand it, how Pa Shen could  have loved the son that murdered her daughter and took her place. Only the fact  that Cinnamon had acted solely to avenge Fa Shen seemed to have kept Pa Shen  from killing Cinnamon when she had the chance.</p><p>So many mistakes in the past. It  seemed inconceivable that the fates would give Cinnamon another chance. It was  just too sudden. It was like a dream. If it was a dream, no doubt it would  shatter right at the moment of truth. She might arrive in the village and  suddenly things would twist sideways into some other string of events, if the  walk to the village itself did not divert into some meandering abstraction of meaning  and purpose. Thus, she kept her senses wide open, drinking in the rich textures  of the world, clinging to their seeming reality, while agonizing over every  interminable step.</p><p>Ranko  did not know what Fa Shen whispered to Akane before performing the kiss of  marriage, but knowing what she knew now, it had not been hard to guess. Most of  what she needed to know, to understand either of her twins, had been passed on  to her through past unions. The experiences both of her reflections had just  prior to assuming the identities of Ranma and Fa Shen had caused Ranko enough  trouble second hand. After seeing what Ranma went through, coming to terms with  the legacy of her date with Ryouga-well, in specific embracing her femininity  and going all the way with the lost boy-it did not take Ranko much thought to  understand that Fa Shen had been on the verge of shattering. It was the exact  same problem Ranma had faced, for the same reasons. Deep in the pit of her  stomach, Ranko recognized that it was her fault. Not entirely, since her  parents and Cologne created the problem, but Ranko had instinctively found a  solution, and selfishly claimed it entirely for her self.</p><p>The problem, of course, was thinking  of Ranma and Fa Shen as two different people. It was made worse by the demand  for a perfect version of Ranma, imposed by her parents, and the expectation of  a perfect version of Fa Shen, presented by Cologne. With her reflections to  either side seeming perfectly suited to fulfill those expectations, she had  been cast aside-for the first time in her life completely free of constraints  and obligations-to fend for herself. It even helped that she had no clue what  to call herself or who she really was for a while. That let her take stock of  all the things she could be and decide which parts suited her. The discovery of  her past life as Fa Shen had been a godsend, though she recognized that  identity was as great a threat to her autonomy as going back to being Ranma.  Having the life of a boy suddenly balanced out by the life of a girl gave Ranko  the ultimate freedom. It blew away any argument that she was "meant"  to be one or the other-and she had seen at once that she needed to be a girl  in order to become whole.</p><p>Ranko had found that really hard to  explain to anyone, and it still seemed that everyone thought she had committed  herself to being one-hundred-percent girl. No matter how often she stressed  that she was both, people had it firmly in their heads that Ranko was a girl  now and forever. But the truth was, emphasizing her girl side had simply been  necessary to integrate her past life as Fa Shen, to blend all the parts into a  new whole, and THAT was who Ranko was.</p><p>She knew it never would have been  possible without the onus of actually BEING Ranma of Fa Shen lifted from her  shoulders. As traumatic as it was to have the ki of Ranma and Fa Shen stripped  away, leaving her on the verge of death, the thing that had really frightened  her was hearing the designated Ranma suddenly assert that "he" was Fa  Shen. She had panicked, fearing she would suddenly be thrust back into the role  of Ranma, and unilaterally dumped the name and all the obligations on her other  reflection. She had already been itching to lay claim to the identity of Ranko,  and as far as she had known it had just been a name to her other reflection.  She never imagined that Ranma, stuck as a girl, could ever come to terms with  the fact so quickly. That was pretty stupid, since she was the same person and  she had done the same thing-if for entirely different reasons.</p><p>As it happened, her sister-self had  not particularly wanted to be Ranko. It just did not have the same meaning for  her. Unfortunately, she did want something that "Ranma, the  Man-Among-Men" was forbidden-and if she had not been forced to admit  that, her love for Ryouga would have torn her apart. Ranko had no doubt of  that, because Ranma's passion had almost taken full possession of her, even  second-hand. She still felt it. Just like she felt the passion Fa Shen denied.  Neither she, nor Fa Shen, had ever consummated, or even really expressed, the  troubled and confused love they both experienced for Akane, as Ranma. That did  not make it any less powerful. Where love for Ryouga had burst forth suddenly  and unexpectedly, like the sun emerging through a tear in the angry clouds of a  thunderstorm, love for Akane had approached stealthily from the abyss of night,  bringing color to the whole horizon before swelling into a blinding brilliant  orb, rising majestically into the vault of heaven.</p><p>It was funny, really. Ranma loved  Akane, in spite of the fact that he did not want to. It was tragic, too. Ranko  loved Akane, in spite of the fact that she gave up the right to. It was going  to tear Fa Shen apart, because she did not love Akane at all-and because she  owed her existence as Fa Shen to Ranma, the part of her that was still Ranma,  sacrificing his own existence for the sake of a girl whose life was cut  tragically short by murder. That was the horrible joke, the flaw Ranko never  even imagined. It did not matter to Ranma that Fa Shen was the same person as  him. He could not ignore a person in need, particularly not a girl, and  absolutely not in the face of terrible injustice-his mandate as a martial  artist forbade it.</p><p>His own nature forbade it.</p><p>It was just so ironic. Ranko had  gone too far to ever go back to being Ranma. It had nothing to do with not  being man enough. She had just changed too much, too well. Even Ranma had  changed too much to be Ranma, and not because she had embraced her womanhood.  Ranma and Ranko had both lost everything and started over, each finding the  things they needed to move on. Ranko, within herself, and Ranma in her  relationship with Ryouga.</p><p>In addition to being granted all the  rights, privileges and obligations of being Fa Shen, in spite of being  miraculously resurrected, she also possessed everything that rightfully  belonged to Ranma. The Ranma she evolved from was never forced to give up his  identity, his inheritance, his manhood, or even his fiancées. For good or ill,  he remained true to himself-even in ceasing to exist to bring an amazon girl  back to life. Poor Fa Shen knew this. Just as she knew he still loved Akane,  clueless as he was about how to express it, or confess it. Just as she knew he  was incapable of assimilating her-the very notion would appall the Ranma  locked away in her.</p><p>Which meant Fa Shen had no choice  but to assimilate him-in the process destroying both of them, not knowing what  would rise from the ashes. What choice did she have, now that she was married to  Akane? In his own, perversely mule-headed way, Ranma would refuse to believe  the marriage applied to him. As far as he was concerned, Akane was married to  FA SHEN-however stupid the situation, and amazon law in general, seemed to be.  As long as Fa Shen considered the arrangement binding, he would not resist. He  might not even feel entitled to protest, especially if Akane did not-in spite  of the fact that he would resist-had resisted-such a marriage, himself.</p><p>Ranko sighed heavily, her eyes still  locked on the sight of her male half helping Akane escort Fa Shen back to the  village. He struggled to keep the guilt and grief he felt off his face, but she  could still tell he was thinking along the same lines she was, and the turmoil  on Fa Shen's face was all the confirmation those thoughts needed. She was  afraid. There was no missing that. She knew damn well, from seeing the result  of Ranma and Ranko assimilating her, how far from herself she might end up  after assimilating him.</p><p>Ranko let her attention drift to  Akane, surprised to notice that she had reverted back to her normal self.  Obviously, this turn of events had stirred up some powerful emotion that  suitably countered her defiance, but Ranko could not, for the life of her,  guess what it was. Naming it was not really that important anyway. Once  experienced, Akane would now be able to revisit the moment and summon that  emotion at will-with the correct training and discipline. From her aura, Ranko  could tell it was actually an emotion somewhat characteristic of Akane. She had  seen much the same aura around her when she was fighting for Shinnosuke's life.  Concern or devotion, or maybe sheer, naked determination.</p><p>Before she could comment on the  change, however, Ranko noticed there was a crowd massing at the gates to the  village. Squinting her eyes, she tried to make out what the cause of this new  commotion was. She really hoped people were not coming out to  "congratulate" Akane and Fa Shen on their union. Neither of them was  the least inclined to celebrate.</p><p>Suddenly, through a part in the  crowd, she made out the distinctive features of Prince Herb, and a flash of his  familiar robes and armor. "Shit. The Musk are back," she cursed under  her breath. Racing ahead, she hoped she could distract them from the rest of  her party, maybe lure him away before he overheard anything about Fa Shen's  marriage. "This is so not happening!"</p>
