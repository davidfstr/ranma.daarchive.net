</div>It's All In The Reflexes<p>A  Reflections Mini-Sequel</p><p>A. V.  Morgan</p><p>Part  Eight</p><p>The  Matron of Mysteries, Po Shen, had returned to the Matriarch's Manor bearing a  satchel nearly as large as she was. That was not really surprising, since the old  woman had to be at least as old as Cologne, and equally shrunken. Settling down  at the table, she had asked for a carafe of water and produced what could only  be an Instant Curse packet and a bag of what appeared to be very coarse salt.  It was the salt that tipped Akane off. He remembered visiting Dr. Tofu with  Ranma, the morning Cologne took him and the copies back to Mirror Mansion, and  hearing the doctor say something about a potential cure using salted Twins  water. It had something to do with altering the effects of the  Chuanshontsuniichuan so that it split a person into cursed and uncursed forms,  instead of creating twins with the same curse. The explanation the old woman  gave, as she poured the packet and a cup of salt into the carafe—stirring the water  with a long, slender stick—confirmed Akane's suspicion.</p><p>"Now, obviously, there are some  risks and uncertainties," Po Shen paused to regard Akane sternly.  "This is a proven method of unmasking a locked curse victim, and has  successfully divided those who have mastered a curse. However, with mastery of  a curse comes the possibility of multiple curses. Unsalted, this mixture would  only create a double, but tainted with salt, it will split off every body an  individual might possess. This is why I did not attempt to try this on your  friend with the poor sense of direction."</p><p>"Are you saying that it would  hurt him to be split into boy, girl and pig forms all at the same time?"  Akane chewed his lip nervously.</p><p>"Honestly, the total mass  involved is not significantly altered, with the piglet form thrown in. Should,  say, a certain rogue known in these parts as Pantsuto Taro—" Po Shen  quirked an eyebrow as she was cut off.</p><p>"Pantyhose!" Akane blurted  in shocked comprehension. "He'd split up into a yeti, a bull, a crane, an  eel, an octopus and a boy!"</p><p>"I see you have met him,"  Po Shen chuckled dryly. Clearing her throat, she elaborated, "You see the  first problem. Obviously, a Jusenkyo curse seemingly defies the physical law of  conservation of mass and energy. A scientist unfortunate enough to witness a  transformation would suffer apoplexy over it, lacking an understanding of ki  and the effects it can have on things like matter, energy, space and time. If  you take the mechanics of ki into account, the conservation of mass-energy is  preserved. With ki, it is possible to convert mass to energy, and then store it  in an isolated pocket of space-time until needed." Po Shen noticed Akane  and Nodoka gawking at her use of such modern terms, and chuckled. "In  ancient times, we spoke of such things as patterns of substance and essence,  and magic was simply the knowledge of how to manipulate the patterns of it  all."</p><p>Po Shen waved that off. "In a  normal transformation from one form to another, the expenditure of ki is  virtually unnoticeable. It too tends to be conserved in the transformation, so  the greatest drain is at the time one is initially cursed. This, however,"  she tapped the carafe, "would break up a gestalt form like Taro's,  manifesting all the component aspects."</p><p>The elder paused for a moment,  sharing a look with Cologne.</p><p>Cologne nodded. "We are aware  that curse twins each end up with as much ki as the original victim."</p><p>"It has always seemed  interesting to me how Jusenkyo curses tap into a source of raw ki, but past  experience has revealed that there are limits to this particular miracle,"  Po Shen resumed. "As I said, the acquisition of a curse places a great  demand on a victim's ki, the ki needed to destroy one form and create another.  The ki demanded by a curse is taken from the limited amount possessed by the  victim prior to the transformation. Somewhere during transformation a channel  is opened to replenish what the curse appropriates. However, in the midst of  transformation, the only thing sustaining the person between the destruction of  one form and the creation of another is whatever ki remains after the curse  claims its share.</p><p>"The twins curse takes a much  bigger bite out of a victim, and the smaller reserve of sustaining ki has the  additional task of replicating her psyche in preparation to assume control of  the two bodies. Obviously, each body that is added to this equation diminishes  the reserve and adds to the work it must do to supply each form with a  mind," Po Shen's tone left no doubts as to the seriousness of that  situation.</p><p>"Unfortunately, that is not the  full extent of the problem," she grinned evilly. "There is also the  physical shock of division. Splitting and merging is a traumatic process, and  the shock increases geometrically for each additional separation. Since  everything happens at once, the shock is experienced by all parts, and in  Taro's case the shock would definitely kill him after the fact, even if the  depletion of ki during the split did not," she concluded.</p><p>"The Musk used this to wipe out  the original Shokei Adepts," Cologne contributed grimly, gesturing to the  carafe of tainted water.</p><p>Po Shen nodded. "That is the  ultimate danger of mixing curses, whether they are blended or mastered  separately. Only someone with a limitless supply of ki and ridiculous tolerance  for pain could survive such an attack. But, that's not a danger here," Po  Shen clucked and returned to instructing Akane. "There was no reason to  inflict twice as much pain on your friend just to test whether or not a ki  triggered curse would be revealed by this method. In your case, there is only  the usual pain, and it serves the useful purpose of confirming that you can  regain your normal form."</p><p>Akane nodded stiffly. His body had  grown increasingly tense as what he was about to do sank deeper into his  consciousness. If this worked, he was about to confront his- herself in an all  too literal fashion. With an odd pang, he realized that it would be yet another  impossible experience he would have in common with his fiancé. "Under the  circumstances, you'd think I'd be getting better at understanding hi-  them," he muttered to himself plaintively.</p><p>"Well, the water is ready,  Child. I'd advise you to change out of your clothes before we proceed. You will  suffer enough without having to tear your way out of them when you split,"  Po Shen advised. "Just wrap a sheet around yourself. Or two, if you don't  want to share it afterwards."</p><p>Akane blushed furiously,  understanding the point of that warning. Given his normal temperament, it would  not be good for his health to be male, naked and alone with his female self  under a sheet. Reflexes alone would guarantee much violent pounding. Akane  squeaked and shuddered as an unholy part of his mind presented a different  interpretation of those words. "Good idea," he hopped up, as if  fleeing from his own shadow. "I'll be right back."</p><p>"I believe we won't need an  audience for this, Sisters," Cologne addressed the assembled elders. With  dignity, they nodded and excused themselves, except for Po Shen. Nodoka  followed the elders to the door, while Cologne ushered Mousse and Shampoo off  to their rooms.</p><p>At the door, after the last of the  elders had been sent off with the proper salutations, Nodoka was almost bowled  over by one of her "sons" charging into the manor in something akin  to a blind panic. "Ranma?" she called out, as he dodged around her at  the last second.</p><p>The boy stopped suddenly, looking as  though he's been stabbed, and glanced down at himself. A faint bloom of steam  rose from his damp clothes, and he groaned. He could not believe he forgot to  lock his curse, even with the reminder Ranma had given him earlier. Shaking his  head, he met his mother's eye for a blushing second, "Er, sorry. It's me,  Ranko. Someone musta thrown out their wash water when I was running by. Why  don't I ever notice this stuff?" he asked himself, turning and wandering  toward the kitchen for cold water. As desperate as he was to see Akane, and  find out what had happened, it still was a bad idea to show up in male form.  The distraction gave him a moment to wrestle with his thoughts and emotions.  Absorbed in the effort to sort them into some order that would not spill out of  his mouth in the worst way the moment he confronted Akane, he did not notice  the carafe of water sitting on the table, or the diminutive elder sitting  across the table from him, until he had almost walked by.</p><p>The action was so automatic, and his  preoccupation so great, he had snatched the carafe and tipped it over his head  in one fluid motion, before Po Shen could even think of giving warning.</p><p>"Goddess! No! Don't—!"  the woman cried, leaping up at Ranko.</p><p>It was too late, water spilled over  the lip as Ranko jerked in shock, whipping around to look at the elder. The old  woman rocketed past, snatching the carafe out of his hand, but half it's  contents were already coursing down his face, through his hair and splashing  against his shoulders. The tingle of transformation set in, and then pain  exploded through the emerging girl's body. She screamed in agony as the feeling  of something cleaving her body in two started at the crown of her head, shot  down the length of her spine and then exploded outwards to the tips of her  fingers and toes.</p><p>Po Shen landed across from where she  had been seated, carefully swinging the carafe through a braking arc, to keep  the remaining contents from splashing wildly. Turning around, she watched the  girl lurch toward her, curling up over her stomach, falling face forward to the  hard wood floor. As she fell forward, the male form she had displaced reared  backward, tearing his way out through the back of his shirt. The pants that had  begun to slip down her hips, strained at the sudden presence of two pairs of  legs, and the outside seams split with a shriek of tortured fabric. The girl's  terrible scream was now echoing from the boy's throat, fading into silence as  the two bodies shuddered and slumped unconscious to the ground coming to rest  spooning together like lovers.</p><p>In that instant, three people  crashed together in the door way.</p><p>"Ranko—!" Nodoka was  shouting in alarm.</p><p>"What the hell was  THAT—!" Akane was yelling in terror.</p><p>"That was much too quick—"  Cologne complained, already well aware what the screaming entailed, if not  correct about who was being ripped in two. Of course finding herself squashed  between Nodoka and a sheet clad male Akane, it struck her instantly that things  were not as expected. Bounding into the room in Nodoka's wake, as the  distraught mother homed in on her distressed child, Cologne spotted Po Shen  cautiously setting the carafe back on the table and studying the red-headed boy  and girl on the floor. While Nodoka sprawled beside them, Cologne came to rest  beside Po Shen with a severe look on her face.</p><p>"Ranko?" Akane gasped,  fitting the words and images assaulting his brain together, and creeping last  into the room.</p><p>"Po Shen! Explain this!"  Cologne demanded.</p><p>"I can hardly believe it,  Cologne, much less explain it," the other elder confessed, still gaping in  shock. "He- she stormed through the room heading for the kitchen… Wasn't  even looking at me or the water. Quick as you please, she snatched the water  and poured it on herself. It was totally unexpected. There was no time to stop  her, let alone warn her. It's fortunate she's only got the one other  form!"</p><p>"True enough," Cologne  nodded, sighing heavily, "However, she's already been split by the Mirror  of Broken Souls twice. There has to be a limit to how many times a single  person can be divvied up!"</p><p>Po Shen remained wide eyed. Shaking  her head, she observed, "She did take it rather hard." She joined  Cologne in taking a closer look at the split Ranko, examining the physical and  spiritual condition of each, while Nodoka fussed over them, ordering Akane to  fetch them robes or something, as the single set of shredded clothing did  little to protect their modesty. Reaching a quick conclusion, Po Shen sighed,  "We cannot assess any mental trauma until they're awake. Physically, I  doubt I've seen anyone healthier, and they appear to have a normal amount of  ki. Which is to be expected."</p><p>"No, they each ended up with  about half of Ranko's normal ki," Cologne corrected, privately intrigued.  She had seem something similar in the way her ki was split between her reflections  the night of their double date, and seemed to confirm her suspicions about why  Ranko, and of late her twins, possessed a double measure of ki. It clearly had  something to do with the nature of their curses. "This just dropped them  back to normal standards. By my estimate, they are going to be out for a while.  We should put them in their room to sleep it off." At that point, as Akane  was turning to fetch something to cover the half naked red-heads, Fa Shen  sprinted into the house and screeched to a halt on the threshold of the dining  room.</p><p>"Ranko! I'm gonna STRANGLE you…  for…" Fa Shen took in the scene. "What's going on here? How did Ranma  get here so fast? And who tore the hell outta them?" she demanded, giving  Akane the evil eye.</p><p>"Fa Shen?" Akane flinched,  startled by the glare.</p><p>"Damn it, Akane! You've got to  stop doing this to them! Why can't you just—" but Fa Shen was cut off.</p><p>"I didn't do this! Ranko did it  to herself!"</p><p>Fa Shen choked back her rant, and  blinked in confusion. "I don't—"</p><p>"They are both Ranko,"  Cologne tried to inform helpfully.</p><p>"Oh! Not again! We just went  through this!" Fa Shen shouted, stomping over and grabbing the male  version of her twin and shaking him. "Wake up you idiot! She gave you  Ryouga! What the hell do you have left to fight over!" To her self, she  wondered at the torn clothing in deep concern. There was not enough material  left to piece together a single outfit!</p><p>Sudden tense silence surrounded Fa  Shen.</p><p>"Ranko! Wake up and tell me  what this is about!" Fa Shen reached over and roughly nudged her. Then she  noticed the silent stares. "What?"</p><p>"Do you…" Nodoka swallowed  and composed herself, pointing at Ranko's male side, "Do you think that is  Ranma?"</p><p>Fa Shen sighed and ran her hands  through her hair, "Um. This is really complicated." Struggling to  think of a simple way to explain what had happened since that afternoon, she  frowned mightily. "We're not all as different as we seem," she began,  unhappily. "Some things have happened tonight that have shown us that we…  All three of us are exactly alike, but we've been acting differently, trying to  be different parts of our self." Fa Shen bit her lip, remembering that  their secret was out, and Nodoka and Cologne heard all the details.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Fa Shen  started over. "Ranma, the- the one we've been calling Ranma," she  started hesitantly, before diving headlong into it, "she isn't really  Ranma, anymore than I am. I can be Ranma just as well, just as completely. I  was Ranma for most of today. Since Akane caught me and…" That might not  have been the best thing to bring up. She hurried past it. "I figured it  out first, when I went off sparring with Ryouga. We got in an argument and he  accused me of destroying 'his' Ranko, the one from his date.</p><p>"This is really  confusing," she warned. "When we healed Ra… When two of us had sex,  it broke down the walls between all three of us. When that happens, all our  memories pool, and we would switch to the personality of the memories we had  gotten, so it seemed like we were trading places. So, I remembered and felt  everything that had happened with Ryouga and Ranko-turned-Ranma, but all of  that really happened with just one of us," Fa Shen gestured helplessly to  the unconscious boy. Frowning, "Why do YOU find it strange that I think  this is Ranma?"</p><p>"Because we meant just what we  said. These two ARE both Ranko. The one we've been calling Ranko for the past  week," Cologne clarified, following the example Fa Shen had set. "I  see we're going to have to work out a new way to distinguish you three, if you  all plan to keep changing personalities. But, later. What happened here is that  Ranko came in and splashed herself with salted instant twins water we had  prepared to discover if Akane's natural form is recoverable."</p><p>"You said, 'She gave you  Ryouga'," Akane butted in. He had been growing more and more tense as Fa  Shen struggled to explain herself, his mind focused in on those words, out of  everything she had said, and the fact that she clearly thought she had been  saying them to Ranma.</p><p>Fa Shen wanted to simply evaporate  into thin air. Turning to look Akane in the eye, startled once again by the  masculine appearance and the reaction it aroused in her, she shuddered. "I  love Ryouga," she stated very carefully. That much was true, even if  she—like Ranko—realized she could not act on it. "I love him more than I  can possibly say. But. Only when I AM Ranma." That protest was thrown in  too late to fight the tidal shift her speech set off. The last three words  betrayed her. There was a flicker behind her eyes, and then she turned into a  boy, transforming in character as well as in flesh. "I'm sorry,  Akane," he bowed in exquisite misery.</p><p>Everyone present gaped in shock,  surprised by the sudden sex-change, and blown away by the palpable presence of  Ranma, where a second before they had felt Fa Shen in command of the same body.</p><p>Seeming oblivious to the reaction, "Ranma"  continued. "I know we're supposed to be fiancés an' all, but that date,  the things that happened before it… Everything I had done to keep from  acceptin' my girl half fell apart," he cringed, suddenly becoming female  again. In a more fragile voice, she picked up, "Ryouga made a woman outta  me, got me to accept my girl half. Then I had to go back to bein' my old self.  I didn't know how to do it. The way I was, I could only hate what I had done. I  hated myself, but I had to be 'Ranma'. It was a matter of honor. The only way  to do that was to bury my feelings, to pretend that it was really Ranko who  loved Ryouga."</p><p>"Wasn't it?" Akane  demanded, straining to contain himself.</p><p>"Well, in a way, it was,"  she admitted self-consciously, fidgeting nervously in place. "Ranko an' I,  we'd both made the same decision, the same choices. The guy copy was supposed  to go on as me, an' there was no way I was gonna go off to get a guy curse  until the mirror mess was straightened out. I didn't even know if bein' a guy  again was worth havin' to live with a curse again. We both had feelings for  Ryouga, but since she had the curse, and could still be a man, I was the one  who needed Ryouga more. I mean, if I was at all serious about seein' if I could  go on full time as a girl…" Ranma paused for a while in thought.</p><p>"Ranko was the first to  understand bein' a girl. I got to go a little further with it before I had to  go back to bein' me. The thing is, Ranko wasn't on that date. Ranko didn't give  herself to him. That was me. She can remember it, she can feel it all, but it  was me who lived it," Ranma explained. Then she laughed abruptly. She had  fallen so easily into the memories of Ryouga's Ranma that she had forgotten  there was another Ranma inside her. Shaking her head to clear the confusion,  she corrected herself sharply, "No. That's totally wrong. I was on a date  with you that night, Akane."</p><p>Akane blinked in confusion, then  remembered.</p><p>"It's pretty confusing,"  she shrugged. "Like I was in two places at once, one set of memories  overpowers the other. Damn, I'm gonna have to think about this a lot  more." In the back of her mind she remembered Ranko explaining that  copy-Ranko had been the side of her that came from Fa Shen, while copy-Ranma  had been the side of her that came from Ranma. Combined with the truth behind  the personality shifts, she suddenly glimpsed an entirely different explanation  of the awakening of Ranma and Fa Shen.</p><p>"So, what happened to 'my'  Ranma?" Akane asked timidly.</p><p>"Er, ah," she nervously  rubbed the back of her neck. The question innocently landed right on the head  of her uncertainty. "That's me, I guess. I mean, it works out the same way  as with Ryouga's Ranma. But, I gotta say, when I am Fa Shen, I have a real hard  time dealin' with, er, me. You know, bein' Ranma." There was a long pause,  as Ranma stared inward. What if it was true? What if Ranko had been right? Did  that mean the other Ranma was really a Fa Shen who was assimilating her  reincarnation as Ranma? Did that mean she was the real Ranma—a Ranma who was  choking on the memory of who he had been in an earlier life? She frowned,  focusing in on something she had refused to admit to herself and sharing it  aloud, "When I am Fa Shen, I am afraid somethin' will force me to be  Ranma. That I'll throw away somethin' as important as Ryouga was to me—ah, the  other me—because of my sense of honor."</p><p>Akane looked away, struggling to  hide a stab of misery.</p><p>Ranma looked down at the split  Ranko. "An' I know I will. I just watched myself do that tonight. Ranko  giving Ryouga up to save Ranma."</p><p>"Is- is that why you're usually  Fa Shen? Is it YOUR sense of honor, Ranma, that forces you to be HER?"  Akane asked, still not looking at him.</p><p>Ranma started, staring at him.</p><p>"I'm sorry, that was a mean  question," Akane waved it off. "But, can I just ask… I need to know,  and- and I can't- I can't ask HIM." He turned to look into Ranma's eyes  imploringly, "Is Ryouga the only person you can love?"</p><p>There was a long pause, as Ranma  continued staring at the youngest Tendo. The night of her date with Akane  surging to the front of his mind. With a painful swallow, and with complete  obliviousness to a sudden change back to male, he finally answered, "No.  Ryouga's not the only person I love. I- I just- I don't know if things can- can  work out, is all."</p><p>Akane had caught his breath at the  sudden change, again, but was held even more transfixed by the look of terror  underlying Ranma's steady gaze. With a nod, he stood up and stepped back.  "Thanks. I- I know that wasn't easy for you. Um. Look, why don't you take  these two upstairs?" he suggested, pointing them out, eager to change the  subject. "I have to do this test, to see if I can ever be myself  again…"</p><p>Ranma blinked a few times,  struggling with the inner turmoil stirred up by his admission, and then nodded.  Gathering the girl Ranko up in his arms, he shifted her onto his shoulder and  reached for the boy. "Can you wait? Until I come back down? I- I'd like to  be here for- well… I'm sure this is gonna work, but maybe you'd like to talk  about what happened today. I- I have a lot of explaining to do."</p><p>Akane looked at him, standing with a  Ranko thrown over each shoulder. With a nod, he smiled, "Take your time.  It sounded like this is going to be really painful. I'm not in any real hurry  to find out." Ranma returned the smile and exited. Nodoka softly excused  herself, following the trio upstairs.</p><p>Shampoo  and Mousse exchanged confused looks as the sounds from the room below  diminished. There was no doubt that it had been enlightening for them to slip  into Cologne's study to eavesdrop through the vent. Instead of just finding out  if Akane's womanhood could be restored, though, they had overheard the screams  of Ranko suffering the peculiar, catastrophically bad luck of the Saotome's,  and the even more bizarre evolution of the triplets' identity crisis. Of course  it would be bad if their presence in the study was discovered, so they  wordlessly slipped away to Shampoo's room before Ranma could arrive upstairs  with the twinned Ranko. The door eased shut as he reached the head of the  stairs, and they turned to look at each other again.</p><p>It was an awkward moment, haunted by  the peculiar history the two shared. There was a time, long ago, when they  could honestly say they had been friends. When they were young enough that they  had been immune to the constraints of gender, it would not have been unusual  for them to skulk about together on some adventure or to retreat to Shampoo's  room in the wake of some mischief. That innocent camaraderie had evaporated all  too soon, when Shampoo had begun to assert her natural dominance as a girl, and  Mousse's childhood affection began to turn into infatuation. That said, it had  been over a decade since Mousse had been in Shampoo's room alone with her, with  the door shut. It was the first tangible proof that they had been significantly  affected by their recent role reversal.</p><p>Backing away from the implications  of that, Shampoo cleared her throat and announced, "Maybe now good time  you explain what you doing, Mousse. No have time when you come back to ask,  what you thinking? You go off with Musk boys like that! You know no good can  come of mixing up with likes of them!"</p><p>Mousse blushed faintly, turning to  study the door. "That's not really the issue, Shampoo, and we both know  it," he murmured, putting force into his words but speaking softly to  minimize the offense. "Our 'marriage' changed too many things, Shampoo.  Changing sexes, we both let go of a part of ourselves, our pride maybe, and at  least I can't help but wonder if things were better that way."</p><p>"We agree we no talk about  that, Mousse," Shampoo retorted in a strained voice.</p><p>"I think we should. I think we  have to," Mousse insisted, turning to stare at her. Or, as his glasses  were perched on top of his head at the moment, to stare intently at the window  across the room from her. "Because it has a lot to do with what we will  both be forced to do."</p><p>"Shampoo not know what Mousse  talking about."</p><p>"I'm talking about love,  Shampoo. I'm talking about…" he shrugged helplessly, turning to track her  voice until her eyes could meet his. "I know about love, Shampoo. The  world can change, or you can become a different person completely, and your  love remains true. If that is true for me, if that was enough to make me marry  you that way, then it's safe to say you will never really give up on Ranko. So,  neither can I."</p><p>Shampoo bit her lip. It was not hard  to guess what he was saying. "Is stupid, Mousse think he can have Shampoo  by marrying same person as Shampoo. Shampoo not even sure, of three, which is  one that can love Shampoo," she confessed, reprimandingly.</p><p>Mousse considered that. Nodding, he  admitted, "It would be impossible for my plan to work without knowing  which of them to challenge. The problem is, I have already issued a  challenge." Technically, he should have fought Ranko already. "That is  a fight I am not sure I want to win now, but at the same time I cannot afford  to lose it. Not if there is a chance you're still interested in Ranko."  Mousse sighed. It was funny in a way. The way he had suckered Shampoo into  marriage, he had actually gained a small measure of respect from the woman he  loved so desperately. "You make a good amazon woman," she had  grudgingly confided in their marriage bed, in their birth tongue. The ordeal  they had gone through together had opened their eyes a little to each other.</p><p>"Do you remember what we talked  about that first night?" he suddenly asked. The sound of her sucking in a  breath encouraged him. "My biggest fear about Saotome was always that you  would break through his pride and arrogance, that he would stop denying his  love for you and make you his."</p><p>Shampoo hugged her arms to her,  slipping into Mandarin, "You feared this because you hoped the same of  me." Shampoo remembered her reaction to that. Her immediate reaction had  been to declare that she had never loved Mousse, nor would she ever, but she  had bit her tongue as she made the connection. Her pursuit of Ranma was  painfully similar to Mousse's pursuit of her. Her lack of love for Mousse was  sort of a death knell for her own hopes. She had dredged her soul in search of  some shred of love for the blind boy, as a way to convince herself that she had  a chance with Ranko, or Ranma—or even Fa Shen, for that matter.</p><p>There was a possibility there. There  had always been buried affection, and his stupid, blind devotion had often touched  a chord within her. She could hardly deny that when she remembered how  mercilessly she had stomped those feelings into dust. She could now add, to her  reasons for despising Mousse, the fact that he had given her a strong argument  for respecting his feelings. She also had to wonder if her doomed relationship  with Ranma- Ranko was some kind of instant karmic retribution for her treatment  of Mousse. The doubts and fears—and desperation—had been enough to prompt her  to consider the most ridiculous of plans.</p><p>"I think I get where you are  going," Shampoo finally nodded. "You heard that Ranko gave up on  Ryouga. That means I wouldn't be able to get to her through him, like we talked  about…" Shampoo trailed off. It had been a fabulously stupid plan, and  while she and Mousse pretended they were not really serious about it, neither  of them had come up with a better one. A plan that respected the complicated  web of affections they had forced themselves to address. Sighing, she  confessed, "I had my doubts about a group marriage, anyway."</p><p>"As long as I won't give up on  you, and you won't give up on Saotome, do we really have a choice?"</p><p>"Not to mention, one Saotome is  literally no different from another," Shampoo pointed out, with a shudder.  "Fa Shen became Ranma between one word and the next. It's scary." She  was tempted to mention her attempt to seduce Fa Shen earlier. At the moment,  she had no idea which of them she had really cornered in the shower. Closing  her eyes, she tried to work it out. Based on what she had only just overheard,  the one she had come on to was now together with Ryouga. Frowning, she  considered the implications of that. "They're not being very coy about  their feelings for Ryouga," she observed, her throat tightening painfully.</p><p>Mousse stiffened at the effect that  had on her voice, and tilted his head forward to allow his glasses to drop to  the bridge of his nose. Taking a good look at her, he decided she had finally  figured it out. In an odd voice, he commented, "It's kind of funny what a  relief it is when you are forced to see the truth. To know the one you love  truly does not love you back."</p><p>Shampoo's head snapped up. Staring  at him, she could not think of anything to say for several moments. Finally,  she simply asked, "What do you mean by that?"</p><p>Mousse shrugged, "There's no  need to play the fool once you stop fooling yourself. As your wife, it did not  take me long to figure out that you did not love me. However imperfect the marriage  was, our laws did not interfere with us for once. I was forced to accept that  you had not been putting on an act for your great-grandmother, pretending to  hate me so no one would be suspicious of our true feelings. No, our true  feelings were plain enough for all to see." The words held all the bitter  venom of towering humiliation. "I was the only one who refused to see the  truth."</p><p>Shampoo looked down at her feet.  This explained why nothing she had done, as a man, had been enough to arouse  the boy turned girl. In spite of knowing exactly what buttons to push, the  realization that Shampoo felt little more than pity must have turned Mousse  frigid with shame and humiliation. Ironically, if Mousse had been more  responsive, the two of them would probably have been stuck with their adopted  cursed forms. Not that either would really regret that, but it would have  cemented their marriage. It was almost a shame. It would certainly have been  simpler than throwing themselves back into the chaos surrounding Ranma.  "If you had not been so blind from the beginning, chances are I would have  loved you. It was your obsession that made things impossible between us,"  she criticized with an ounce of genuine regret. A regret she had kept to  herself since puberty.</p><p>Mousse swallowed audibly.</p><p>Shampoo turned away from him to look  out the window. There was something else struggling to make its way out of the  depths of her mind. Something tickled forth by the scene she had overheard.  Part of it was the notion that the triplets were truly identical, inside and  out. "Ranko gave Ryouga to Ranma," she said aloud, probing at it like  a sore tooth. Why did that bother her? If they were all the same, what  difference did it make who got the one they loved? What could give one of them  a better claim to him than the rest?</p><p>Shampoo punched herself in the head,  "It's so obvious! Ranma was the one who slept with him!"</p><p>"Huh?" Mousse blinked,  tipping sideways to lean casually against the frame of the door, and missing it  completely. Picking himself up, he grumbled, "I mean, we already know  this. What is your point?"</p><p>"Marriage law," Shampoo  said grimly. "If what Fa Shen was saying tonight is true, there are no  special exceptions for the triplets. It's the same as if they had a personality  curse, or multiple personalities. Each of them is responsible for their  individual actions. Being confused about who you are is no defense against the  kiss of marriage! That means Ryouga is Ranma's husband!"</p><p>Mousse stood unbalanced for a  moment, seriously contemplating a face plant, but something told him he had not  heard the worst of Shampoo's thoughts. In a weak voice, he begged softly,  "Oh, please. Please don't tell me…"</p><p>"Th- the same rules make me Fa  Shen's wife," Shampoo finished.</p><p>"B- b- but HOW!" Mousse  exploded.</p><p>"It's simple," Shampoo  explained in a shallow, breathless voice. "Because she's still Ranma.  Another Ranma, but the one who consummated our marriage."</p><p>"But, what about you turning  her into a guy?"</p><p>Shampoo tossed her head angrily,  "Don't you see, if she's not JUST Fa Shen, if part of her really is Ranma,  what I did isn't a crime. It might be ruthless or even cruel, but if she's even  half a man at heart, I had the option of bringing the man out. Unless someone  can prove I never intended to allow the girl side out again, or the way things  happened, refused to let her get a nyanniichuan curse, I was well within my  rights in pursuing my husband!"</p><p>Mousse closed his mouth with a snap.  "Can this get any more complicated?" he demanded in irritated  frustration. He could not argue with her, though. The elders would reach the  same conclusion, and any ruffled feathers on the part of the bride and groom  would be dismissed for the good of the tribe. The outcome was far more  important after all. Taking a deep breath, he brought up the first question  that came to mind, "What about Herb's challenge, then?"</p><p>Shampoo shrugged, "What about  it? With her curse, my husband is capable of being Herb's wife. If he defeats  her."</p><p>Mousse laughed bitterly. "And I  am the idiot who just helped assure his victory," he accused himself. At  least it settled the question of what to do about his challenge to Ranko.  Losing that fight would not diminish his chances with Shampoo. Stumbling toward  a chair, he slumped into it. Briefly, he wondered if there was a way to shift  Herb's interest over to Ranko, and challenge Fa Shen himself. No doubt, Shampoo  could guess his thoughts, and he forced himself to wonder if there was any  point. In what way would that plan make continuing to pursue his love any less  hopeless? "Damn."</p><p>Shampoo settled on her bed, studying  the man who had been her wife. Seeing things in this new light did not fill her  with the delight it would have two weeks ago. Instead, there was a crawling  dread. A dread of lying in bed with Fa Shen, indifferent to his touch, because  deep in her heart she knew he did not—maybe could not—truly love her. Her  unexpected victory held the taste of ashes, and that was frightening.  "Maybe it's best not to say anything about this. Maybe no one else will  figure it out," she suggested timidly.</p><p>Mousse looked up at her, carefully  adjusting his glasses to disguise his surprise. "You know that might not  be wise. The council will be examining all of us, and if the truth comes out,  they will not be pleased to hear you tried to hide this," he advised  sternly. "Not that I blame you. I wouldn't want to be the one to tell Fa  Shen about this, but it's not like you to back away from something like  this."</p><p>Shampoo folded her hands in her lap.  "She would hate me."</p><p>Mousse tried to follow her thoughts,  and a moment later he bolted to his feet. The parallels between them were clear  enough. If that was the conclusion she had reached, it left Mousse no doubts  about her true feelings for him. But along with that stab of rejection came the  seeds of a plan to sabotage the relationship between Shampoo and Fa Shen. In a  tight but heated voice, he pointed out, "Being a husband would be beneath  Fa Shen. No doubt she'd much prefer to be Herb's wife. With his curse, she'd  have little need for a wife of her own, don't you think?"</p><p>Shampoo jerked at the spiteful tone.  Still, Mousse might have a point, she nodded to herself mutely. Mousse seemed  to take her action for a reply, and silently stormed out of her room. Only after  he was gone, did it occur to Shampoo that she might have just created more  trouble for Fa Shen. Stalking out of her room, she growled, "Stupid  Mousse! Fa Shen doesn't love HIM either!" But, Mousse had not lingered to  catch any last remarks from her. Shampoo paused a moment in indecision, then  decided it would be best to warn Fa Shen, about herself and about Mousse  betraying her to Herb.</p><p>Akane  stared at herself in a torment of relief and uncertainty. She had been terribly  afraid this experiment would prove the worst, but as she studied her hands she  decided the pain of being split had been a small price to pay for the  reassurance that somehow, some way, she would be able to return to normal. At  least, she felt her present state offered some hope for her twin. She could not  get the look he had given her, before storming out into the courtyard, out of  her mind. She had a morbid need to know what her other self was experiencing at  this moment, but she had taken Ranma's advice and remained where she was while  he went after her twin. Pulling the sheet tighter around her, she looked out  into the yard to see them still talking. Ranma had gone girl again, and seemed  to be speaking very urgently to the male Akane.</p><p>"Even when they know it is only  temporary, people suffer terribly at being cast off in their cursed form when  confronted with the uncursed version," an ancient voice intruded softly.</p><p>Akane turned to look at Po Shen.  "I can almost tell you what she is thinking," she confided guiltily.  "I don't know what it will take to find the trigger to this curse, but I  could stay the way I am now and at least I would be normal. Part of me already  came to terms with being stuck as a boy the last time. It wouldn't be easy for  her, but… hell, I would stay a boy if that was the only way to guarantee…"</p><p>Po Shen smiled gently, not at all  surprised by the confusion that caused the girl's thoughts to break off.  "I suppose anyone of good character would make such a sacrifice for the  sake of those they loved. I am sure you are concerned about your family and  friends, how they would take the loss of the girl they know and the appearance  of a boy in her place. Of all curses, in a situation like this, yours does  offer a chance of a normal life for both halves. Still, it is too great a  sacrifice. It would be best to overcome this, than to try and avoid the  risks."</p><p>Akane bowed her head. "It's  sort of strange. I mean, I watched Ranma go through this. I watched him become  a different person, and watched two different people become him. I guess I feel  like it's cheating somehow if this isn't as hard on me as it was on him."</p><p>"It is a strange tale, that  one. One with greater complications," Po Shen commented, nudging the girl  to her feet and gesturing for her to follow. With a last look at Ranma and  Otoko-Akane, she stood and re-entered the house.</p><p>In the courtyard, Ranma reached out  to take Otoko-Akane's hand. "That's pretty stupid, Akane. You won't be  stuck as a guy! Not if you just have faith in yourself and don't think stupid  things like that!"</p><p>"Is that supposed to be  comforting, you jerk!" he snapped.</p><p>"It's supposed to be the truth,  dummy!" she huffed, wishing for the millionth time that she was better  with words. Fa Shen was, but this did not strike her as the best time to be Fa  Shen. "The hardest part of mastering ki attacks is believing you can  really pull one off. After what you did, I don't see why you think you can't  find the trigger to change back. I'm tellin' you, if you just work at it,  you'll be yourself again in no time. But you have to merge with your other half  to do it. If I had known I could take my reflections back, that it wouldn't be  like killing them, or if I hadn't let my stupid old man con me into thinkin' I  should keep them, I would have gone back to normal."</p><p>"I can't go back to normal! I  am cursed now! Just because it's not a water curse doesn't mean I'll never  change once I can get back my normal form!" he shouted angrily. "So,  maybe I don't really want to stay a guy, and maybe I could have it so I'm only  a boy part of the time, but I'll never be just a girl again! If I want that,  and I really do want that, this is the only way I can have it."</p><p>"Don't fool yourself,  Akane," Ranma shook him wearily. "She'll never be able to live her  life knowing you have shut yourself out of it, sacrificed yourself for her.  It's a stupid idea, and if you fall for it, then you're just stupid,  dummy."</p><p>Akane growled, fighting the urge to  pummel the red-head into the ground, "I can't believe you! Can you be any  more of an insensitive jerk! Can't you even give advice without throwing  insults!"</p><p>Ranma cringed for a moment. When no  blows rained down on her, she looked up through the arms she held over her  head. "If that's what it takes to make you go back and reverse this. I'd  do anything to keep you from makin' the same mistake I made," she  insisted, gradually straightening and dropping her arms. "Maybe it's  stupid to ask you to trust me, after everything… I mean, in a way this is my  fault. Still, trust me about this. If you hate me for everything else, please  don't hate me for trying to spare you some misery."</p><p>Akane calmed down suddenly, giving  the girl's face a searching look. "It really means that much to you?"</p><p>Ranma nodded, grabbing his arm again  and tugging gently in the direction of the manor.</p><p>"Fine. I'll give this a try.  But, if I can't find the trigger, I will have to consider splitting off like  this. I can't go back to my family like this!" he declared vehemently.  Ranma cringed at the note of shame and revulsion.</p><p>As they joined Onna-Akane and the  two elders, Cologne called their attention. "As you know, temporary curses  can last for about a week before they begin to decay. Unlike most, this one can  only be reversed by hot salt-water. Since there will be a residue in your chi  for some time after you reverse the curse, you won't be able to work on the  trigger safely until the contaminated chi is burned off. That means, no ki  attacks!" She gave each Akane a hard, measured look. "With that in  mind, you might wish to wait a while before reversing this."</p><p>"Are you suggesting this for my  benefit?" Onna-Akane asked.</p><p>"You would certainly have an  easier time of it than your twin, for the duration," Cologne acknowledged,  watching the male twin's reaction. "However, upon merging the experiences  you both have separately will pool together. Since either way you are forced to  live for a while as a man, this is one way to soften the impact and possibly  gain a bit of insight into yourself in the process."</p><p>Ranma gave each Akane a considering  look and nodded, "You know, that's not a bad idea. A week is long enough  to figure our for yourself that being split like this really sucks. That might  give you the encouragement to master the trigger to your curse."</p><p>Cologne carefully hid the proud smile  that wanted to surface. It looked like the child she had taken under her wing  was truly gaining wisdom.</p><p>"What about Ranko?" Akane  asked in stereo.</p><p>"Man, when she realizes she's  been split again, she's gonna go ballistic," Ranma rolled her eyes. The  sound of feet running down the steps was followed by a glimpse of Mousse's robe  flashing across the doorway, as he stormed out of the house. Ranma's eyes  narrowed as the sight reminded her that Duck-boy had been out consorting with  the enemy earlier. As she rose, intent on pursuing him, Shampoo showed up in  the door way, seeking out Ranma's gaze.</p><p>"Ranma? Shampoo need to have  talk with Fa Shen. Is very important! You come with Shampoo now, yes?"</p><p>"Fa Shen? I dunno, this isn't  really the time… I just saw Mousse taking off, and he and I need to have a few  words," Ranma protested.</p><p>"Fa Shen have bigger problem to  worry about. Is deadly serious."</p><p>Ranma turned to look at Akane, gaze  moving from one version to the other. With a sigh, she turned and approached  Shampoo. "You better not be playing games with me, Shampoo." As  Shampoo shook her head, a faint tremor passed through the red-head's body.  "Does this have something to do with Herb?" she asked, subtle changes  in voice and poise conveying the personality of Fa Shen.</p><p>Shampoo shuddered, giving a nod in  reply. "That too too creepy."</p>
