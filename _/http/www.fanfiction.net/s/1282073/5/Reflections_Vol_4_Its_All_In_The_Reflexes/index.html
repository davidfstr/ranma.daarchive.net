</div>It's All In The Reflexes<p>A  Reflections Mini-Sequel</p><p>A. V.  Morgan</p><p>Part  Five</p><p>As  Ryouga, Ranma and Fa Shen turned to look at her, Ranko realized she had brought  the conversation to the point they had been dreading. All four of them held a  deep affection for the girl named Akane Tendo. They could hardly count all the  battles "Ranma" and Ryouga had fought for or over her. Ranko suddenly  had to ask herself, how many of those battles had begun over some insult or  injury to Akane? But the truth was that they had given very little real thought  to Akane's feelings. It was almost always just an excuse to fuel their rivalry.  It had been very rare that either of them had truly confronted the harm they  had done to her. Like when Akane's hair had been cut during their first  challenge fight at Furinkan. Unable to comprehend the harm they had done, Ranma  and Ryouga let her have a shot at them, and with Ranma, that had remained the  only way he could acknowledge the underlying pain of Akane's rages. That was  the extent of his understanding, really. Akane kept getting angry, and he never  really understood why, only that somehow Akane had been hurt, and of course he  never really understood why.</p><p>The mystery, however, was beginning  to unravel itself in Ranko's mind.</p><p>"I never really got it  before," she admitted now. With a deep sigh, she looked at the other three  in turn. "I just didn't understand her at all. She was always so angry,  and she always took everything the wrong way. I'd think, she can't take it if I  tease her, but then she would tease me, so I didn't think I'd hafta hold back.  An' it's not like she only got angry when she was hurt. It was like getting  angry was her answer to everything, so I never could tell if I'd done something  wrong. It got to the point that I'd let her hit me just in case I deserved  it."</p><p>"But that just encouraged her.  It made it okay for her to blame me for everything," Ranma cut in with a  depressed look. "She was almost as bad as you, Ryouga. But a lot of times  she was worse. She'd change on me, act nice or be helpful out of the blue and  totally throw me off."</p><p>"Exactly," Ranko nodded,  watching Ryouga bite her lip. Keeping her eyes fixed on Ryouga, she went on.  "The second week of the mirror thing was particularly bad. She changed so  much when Pops decided to make Copy-kun into Ranma, an' my whole life was  falling apart. For the first time it was like she was a real friend, an' she  really cared about me.</p><p>"I could see she was hurtin'  'cuz I'd learned to see that in her eyes. But it was… I dunno, she was hurtin'  'cuz of me, but not because I did anything wrong. She was hurtin' 'cuz I was so  hurt and confused. Like she couldn't stand to see what was happening to  me." Ranko fiddled with her chopsticks over a long empty plate, her eyes  focused on thoughts she was hesitant to spell out.</p><p>"But it wasn't really the first  time, Ranko. I mean, if you really think about it, you were in a lot of scrapes  where Akane was really pulling for you. Whenever things were at their worst, it  was pretty obvious from the way she was acting that she cared about you,"  Fa Shen prompted.</p><p>"But it never really… I mean,  she's the same way with everyone! When she was like that with Shinnosuke, I  thought she was plannin' on marryin' him—but then I find out she didn't love  him. She owed him a debt for saving her life," Ranko reminded her, meeting  her twin's eyes for an instant. Ranko shrugged. "I'd always thought she  must have SOME feelings for me. But times like that actually made it harder to  believe she felt anything special for me. It just meant she cared about people,  especially people in trouble, and kids an' animals and such. There were a lot  of times she'd felt pity for me, 'cuz of the curse or the stupid scrapes it got  me into. I mighta hoped there was more, but it's not like I ever thought she really  l-loved me or anything.</p><p>"Then I look at how I was  always hurting her," Ranko dropped her utensils and crossed her arms.  "Not like I ever tried to beat her up or anything. An' I am pretty sure I  never meant to start any of the fights we got into. I could never figure out  how half of them got started, and the other half I was actually tryin' to help  her out." She turned a hard eye on Ryouga. She did not really need to  point out how many times Akane had accused "Ranma" of picking on P-Chan  or Ryouga. That was not the only reason that much, if not most, of the  interaction between "Ranma" and Akane was antagonistic. Ranko closed her eyes,  trying to let go of past conflicts, "Really, I just didn't get it. I  thought she was the one always starting everything. I didn't realize that Pop  had trained me to start fights without even noticin' it. It's ingrained in me,  like a reflex."</p><p>Ranko could practically feel the  others come to the same realization. Ranma and Fa Shen naturally picked up on  what Ranko was saying. Ranko opened her eyes to see Ryouga regarding her  thoughtfully. A look that said Ryouga was not just looking at her, at the face  and form of the red-headed girl, but that the dark haired neo-girl was  "seeing" her, the substance of the person within.</p><p>As a child of Genma Saotome, Ranko  was an expert on all the ways a person could be hurt by another, since her  father had ruthlessly and relentlessly scourged her with virtually all of them.  In the manner of such things, the constant abuse had forced the former boy's  psyche to toughen to the point where it was second nature to ignore or shrug  off the pain of insults and injustice as casually as she dismissed physical  punishment. The world of Ranma Saotome, the life in which Ranko had her roots,  was a world of pain and punishment. At no time was she allowed to forget the  millions of ways in which she was vulnerable, and so she had developed hundreds  of millions of ways to protect herself. One of the very first techniques she  had learned had been to reply to pain with anger, but the millions of methods  that followed had disciplined that anger, given it the form and focus to  transform her into an extremely effective weapon. True, the perfection of that  weapon had been flawed, scarred by the nyanniichuan curse which revealed or  created weaknesses and vulnerabilities "Ranma" could barely cope with, but  apart from that it had become extremely unusual for Ranko to get or remain hurt  by anything.</p><p>It had not helped that her father  had carefully limited her interaction almost exclusively to other students and  masters of the martial arts. In her world, there were people who pursued the  discipline of the Art, those who practiced the discipline of the Art, and those  who were ignorant of it. Her obligation was to test herself against the first,  to learn from the second and protect the third. From the day she met Akane,  Ranko had accepted the other girl's assertion that she was a student of the  Art, constantly struggling with all the impulses that screamed that Akane was,  in fact, no such thing. How many times had "Ranma" encountered other martial  artists that he had utterly surpassed? It had not really mattered; Ranma had  simply observed the dictates of his personality, classifying those beneath him  in skill as belonging to the first and third category depending on the presence  or absence of significant threat. He would protect those weaker than himself,  but provoke and encourage any who dared to improve themselves.</p><p>There was one little problem.</p><p>It had never occurred to Ranma that  Akane ALLOWED herself to be hurt, psychologically. In the realm of verbal and  social sparring, Ranma had been handing out a constant stream of heavy  abuse—mostly out of habit, thanks to his father—and Akane had taken all the  blows full force, putting up only a token defense if she bothered to defend  herself emotionally at all. She had never been taught, or figured out on her  own, how to take mental abuse. Unfortunately, mental abuse was about the only  kind of offense Ranma had been comfortable with handing out to a girl. Or at  least one with Akane's physical ability. The only other example of such absurd  idiocy Ranko could think of was the way "Ranma" never bothered to defend  himself against Akane's physical abuse. The only difference was, Ranma could  take the abuse. It was annoying and frustrating as hell, but he was always able  to soak up the damage and come out little worse for wear. Most of the time, it  was worth it, since Akane usually stormed off after dispensing punishment and  Ranma was left alone to smooth down any ruffled feathers Akane had managed to  tweak out of place in their verbal sparring. The whole time, the whole eleven  months, Ranma had considered all the conflicts and confrontations as little  more than sparring. It was never anything to get really bent out of shape  about, apart from the fact that Akane's "attacks" were, to Ranma's way of  thinking, dirty blows. In any terms, a kick in the nuts was way too extreme for  sparring, and just about every argument with Akane involved some kind of attack  on his manhood. That had been true from their first confrontation, and Ranma  was not above sinking to low blows in response.</p><p>Obviously, Ranma had always given  Akane far too much credit. He had simply assumed that his opponent would grasp  the concept of never handing out a form of punishment she was not prepared to  receive. It really came as a shock to discover, at this late date, that Akane  was so angry, so HATEFUL, because she had been hurt so badly in their  fights—because Ranma, and by obvious extension, Ranko as she was now, never  realized that Akane had never learned how to defend herself or absorb the  damage.</p><p>What that meant, as far as any of  the triplets were concerned, was that Akane was someone who did not know how to  fight. It made the three of them the very thing they all despised—bullies.  "I never really understood it. She hardly ever treated me better than Pops  did, but the thing was, I almost always let her hit me. Not 'cuz I wanted to  get hit! I don't let people beat on me just because. It was like, I just  couldn't raise my arms against her, even to defend myself. I didn't even wanna  dodge," she admitted in mortification.</p><p>Ryouga noticed how Ranma and Fa Shen  nodded in tandem.</p><p>"I sort of know the feeling. I  don't know how to explain the feeling itself, but it sort of disarms you,"  the lost girl contributed, thinking of the inexplicable confusion she had  suffered when she had been confronted by Copy-chan. With a swallow and a  nervous glance at Ranko, she said what was on all their minds, "That's  when you know you are in love. You realize, how easy it is to hurt… her… but at  the same time, you can't do anything to protect yourself because it would hurt  even more if you did anything to cut yourself off from her."</p><p>"Right," Ranko met Ryouga's  eye. "But here's the thing. I've been like this almost since I met Akane,  but… I never really put two and two together. I could never understand why she  was always acting hurt over everything I said or did… hell, even things she  only imagined or totally misunderstood. I should have figured it out the night  Ranma and I went over to your house, Ryouga."</p><p>Ranma gasped and clutched at his  chest.</p><p>"Ranma thought he'd caught you  two in the act," Ranko put a supporting hand on her 'brother's' knee.  "He thought he'd been rejected, that you an' Akane had decided to dump him  and be with each other. And when Ranma told me what he'd seen, I couldn't  believe it. It was just too painful to be possible.</p><p>"Which is what makes what  happened today seem so… so… God!" Ranko wanted to spit and snarl. "I  got in the habit of thinkin' that it's all just Akane. She gets mad about  everything. She doesn't need a reason. I never even thought about what she'd  think or how she'd feel, all I was thinkin' was that if Ranma and Fa Shen  switched places, they wouldn't have the reversed-curse problem Fa Shen said  would keep them from mastering their curses. I never thought about what it  would look like, and besides, I thought we'd made sure no one would be able to  spy on us."</p><p>"I still can't believe what  happened!" Ranma moaned. His mind flashed back to those precious moments  in the compact. If it had ever occurred to him that having sex with Fa Shen  might be construed as cheating on Akane, he had been completely distracted from  such thoughts by the realization that it was the first time for Fa Shen in her  own body. It had been rather mind blowing for both of them to realize that,  even though they had both had sex three times before, they were suddenly  virgins again. It was the first time either of them had been intimate since  Jusenkyo had restored them to their true sexes in their acquired bodies. He had  not thought past the fact that they had been given a second chance to get  everything right for their "first" time.</p><p>Ryouga laughed, "Well, you told  me, but I don't think even Nabiki could have laid odds on the chance of Akane  tracking you down and catching you in the act like that. It was like an act of  God, like you were destined to be caught, and nothing could have stopped it  from happening."</p><p>Ranko and Fa Shen sighed in  resignation.</p><p>"But it did happen, and even if  we explain it all, I don't know if Akane can ever forgive us," Fa Shen  pronounced, absently gathering dishes into a pile. "We made a serious  mistake, and Ranko was right, all we did was hurt Akane. Whatever our reasons,  that isn't changed. Worse, Ranma and I have to do it again to get back to  normal, even if we abandon trying to master the curses."</p><p>"Why?" Ryouga asked,  perplexed. As far as he could see, the two were back to the status quo.  "Ranma's a boy and you're a girl. What do you need to switch places again  for?"</p><p>Fa Shen stared at Ryouga, setting  down the stack of dishes with a thump. "You can't be serious. If we don't  switch back, Ranma and I are stuck in the wrong bodies."</p><p>"But you're both the right  sex…"</p><p>"You don't get it" Fa Shen  cut her off, with a stern look. "Let me put it this way, you've had sex  with Ranma when he was in this body. I know that, and I can even feel it—like  it's echoing inside me—and it kind of creeps me out whenever I am around you,  Ryouga," Fa Shen explained pointedly, standing up to come around the table  to touch the part-time girl. "If you try, you can feel there's something,  physically, between us. Only we both know there's nothing like that between you  and me."</p><p>Ryouga gulped as the hand on her  shoulder did raise strange, powerful feelings. The only word to describe it was  intimacy. "I don't understand…"</p><p>"What's to understand? The body  has it's own memories. This one knows it has had something special with you. It  hungers for it all on it's own. And, while I can live with it, that's only  because I'm just borrowing it. If I came back to my own body to find something  like that, something I did not choose, it would eat at me. I'd feel violated…"  Fa Shen shuddered, and brushed it off. "So, if we don't switch back,  neither I, nor Ranma, can even think of being with any one else."</p><p>"Huh?" Ryouga looked up at  her, as Fa Shen withdrew her hand.</p><p>"Are you really that dense,  Ryouga?" Ranko stared.</p><p>"Wha…? I mean, no! I think I  get what she's saying, but…" Ryouga shook her head and retreated from the  table a bit. "This is just too weird."</p><p>Ranma cleared his throat, "So,  not much has changed then. We still need the compact, and that means we have to  get Akane to calm down. Maybe she won't forgive us, but we still have to  explain this. How are we going to go about it?"</p><p>"Ranma, maybe it's best for now  to just give her time," Ranko counseled softly, drawing his attention to  herself and holding his eyes. One corner of his mouth turned down, but he gave  a slight nod. With a wan smile, she assured, "She'll cool down on her own,  and it's not like there's any hurry to get you two switched back. It really  only matters if sex comes up, and right now it's best if it doesn't."  Ranko rose up on her knees to gather up their cups and place them on a tray.  "Let's just focus on getting back to our normal routine. Confronting Akane  before she's ready is only going to make things worse, so let's wait for her to  come to one of us. Maybe Ryouga can talk to her, but after dinner I think. What  do you say, Ryou-chan?"</p><p>Ryouga shrugged, "That's fine.  I could use some time to think. If I talked to her now, I'd probably make a  hash of things."</p><p>Ranma stood and reached for the  teakettle, "Well, in that case, why don't you and I go out an' spar for a  bit?" Ranma tipped the kettle over Ryouga, restoring the lost boy's birth  form.</p><p>"Take a kettle and a canteen  with you," Ranko suggested, rising to join Fa Shen in carrying the dishes  to the kitchen. It was always best to have some kind of water handy in case  Ryouga had a pig-fit. "Maybe after we're done in the kitchen, we'll come  out and join you guys."</p><p>As Ranko  and Fa Shen busied themselves in the kitchen, washing the dishes from their  meal and struggling to deal with the aftermath of Akane's cooking lesson,  Shampoo bounded in the door, humming a tune to herself and bouncing past the  other two girls with an abrupt, "Nihao! Shampoo have to deliver message to  Great-Grandmother but be back quick quick to help with clean up!" This  rapid promise was still echoing in the room as the two red-heads turned to  track the lavender blur, coming to face each other with blinking eyes. With a  shrug, they resumed their task. Shampoo flew up the stairs, around and down the  hall, coming to a stop only as she reached the door to the matriarch's study.  Announcing her presence, she waited for an invitation to enter. If the door had  been open even a bit, she would have been free to go right in and deliver her message,  but Cologne had been closeted with Nodoka for most of the day, going over the  paperwork and formalities of Ranko and Fa Shen's adoption by Nodoka, and that  worthy's adoption by Shampoo's own great-grandmother.</p><p>After an unusually long pause, Cologne  admitted her former heir and heard the girl's message. Shampoo obediently  passed a note from a senior member of the council and bowed to excuse herself.  Her sharp eyes had picked up a strange flushed pallor on the two older women's  faces, but as they had composed themselves to admit her, Shampoo knew this was  not the time to voice her curiosity. Before she could leave, however, Cologne  cleared her throat. "Shampoo, Nodoka and I are feeling a little parched.  Would you kindly send Ranko in with refreshments? Tell her to bring a setting  for herself, as well. There is something her mother and I would like to speak  with her about."</p><p>"Yes, Great-Grandmother,"  Shampoo bowed again and left.</p><p>Nodoka turned to Cologne, with a  raised eyebrow.</p><p>"Of the three, I think it would  be best to speak to her first," Cologne stated, in answer of the unvoiced  question. Returning her attention to the documents and books they had been  perusing together before they had been distracted, she cleared her throat  again. "As I was saying earlier, this is a necessary subterfuge. For both  girls, it is perfectly honest and accurate to say that this is their place of  origin. It is rather fortunate we were able to find confirmation of your  father's trip to Jusenkyo. Ranma in particular should be quite surprised to  learn that he was following in his grandfather's footsteps," Cologne  looked up at Nodoka with a grin. "With proof of his passage, and of course  the reputation of this village, it was not difficult to invent a half sister  for you whose passing necessitates you taking custody of the girls. Your own  adoption can easily be explained as a concession to us, assuring that the girls  will retain some of their heritage in your custody."</p><p>"I do appreciate your help in  establishing legal identities for the girls, but I confess, the whole thing  seems so complicated," Nodoka bowed from the neck, still fighting the  blush and the thoughts that sustained it.</p><p>"You should be encouraged,  Child," Cologne reached out a withered hand to cover Nodoka's comfortingly.  "From what we have learned, we can assume that this friend of your fathers  will be understanding if he ever learns about Ranma's condition."</p><p>"It's just so strange,  though," Nodoka met the old woman's eyes. "I just cannot get over the  idea that my father was… was my mother. What are the odds that I'd be the  daughter of his curse?"</p><p>Cologne sniffed, "I think it a  bit more odd that the origin of his curse is so mysterious. According to the  records the Guide showed us, he arrived already cursed in Fa Shen's image, in  search of a cure. It is even more surprising that he escaped from the Musk and  waited to use the Kaisuifuu he had stolen until after you were born. But, given  the facts, what other explanation is there?"</p><p>"And as strange as the idea of posing  as his own wife might be, I am surprised that a priest like Masaki Katsuhito  would risk his reputation by forging the wedding certificate," Nodoka  looked at once disturbed, outraged and grateful. "But you are correct, he  must have known about the curse before it was locked, or he would never have  gone along with it. I find myself even more curious about my father's friend.  It was a very humane thing for him to do, under the circumstances." Nodoka  sighed once again, "But, I cannot help but be disturbed and afraid of what  this means for Ranma. If this could happen to my father, it could just as  easily happen to my son. Because of Herb, the threat has reared its head twice  already, and it makes little difference if the risk is greater for Ranko and Fa  Shen at present."</p><p>"I am personally far more  disturbed by the alias your father used on his visit to the cursed springs. I  can only hope it was some combination of a perverse sense of humor and some  knowledge of the history of the Nyanniichuan. I would hope that is the only  reason he called himself Lo Shen," Cologne muttered darkly. "I dread  the very notion that the true Lo Shen was wandering around fifteen hundred  years later, still a picture of youth and vigor and seeking a way to free  himself of his sister's form."</p><p>Nodoka laughed, "Well, the one  consolation in that would be knowing that he did not sacrifice his manhood to  bear me! If he was Lo Shen, that fate had already befallen him before."  Nodoka sobered thoughtfully and added, "However, it does make one wonder  about the obligation he left me. If his curse was the origin of his demand for  a true male heir, is there any hope of Ranma fulfilling it?"</p><p>Cologne sighed and looked down,  "I am afraid the priest is the only one who can answer that question. I would  personally say that no one could be more of a man than Ranma. Only Fa Shen and  Ranko compare to him, by contrast. Where he has endured this curse to become  more than a man, they have transcended womanhood. None of those three are bound  by the limits other men and women, and even most of those cursed as they have  been, impose on themselves." Cologne's head turned faintly to pick up the  sound of approaching feet. Ranko was making no effort to conceal her approach,  but even then it was difficult for the old woman's trained senses to detect  her. "She comes. How do you want to address this other matter?"</p><p>Nodoka bit her lip. "I don't  know, M-Mother. I don't even know how to bring it up. It kills me to see that  look in their eyes…"</p><p>Cologne nodded and called out,  "Come on in, Ranko." In a lower voice, she advised her adopted  daughter, "Just remember what I told you. Nothing in your life can prepare  you or account for the truth about your child. There is no room for assumptions  or prejudice."</p><p>Ranko eased the door open with her  foot, trays of tea and snacks balanced in her hands and atop her head. She  glided into the room, absently closing the door behind her with the same foot,  and approaching the low table where the two women were seated as though  completely unencumbered. With a deft, darting and floating grace, she juggled  trays of refreshments and cleared space on the table all at once, serving the  three of them even as she completed placing her burdens down. It had the effect  of appearing as though everything served and sorted itself out before them, as  the girl casually sat down. Straightening to attention, she looked at Cologne,  "You wished to speak to me, Elder?"</p><p>"You may call me  Great-Grandmother, Child," Cologne smiled, reaching for her cup to take a  sip of tea. "Your mother and I have finalized all the adoption paperwork.  The ceremony is just a formality. It makes a wonderful excuse for a  celebration, but there is no need for formality here."</p><p>Ranko's eyes widened. "I  see." She picked up her cup and gulped deeply, before a faint noise from  her mother reminded her of her manners. She flushed faintly and took a delicate  sip before placing her cup down. "So, this means I am officially Ranko  now?"</p><p>The two women nodded with warm  smiles. Nodoka looked directly at Ranko, "There will be a few more  legalities to take care of when we return to Japan, but this establishes you as  yourself." She could not help but grin, "I can see that you are  curious how we managed it, and I apologize for keeping all the details from you  until now, but… well, when you hear what we've learned, you will  understand."</p><p>Ranko studied their faces for a  moment. She had not really understood the difficulty of establishing her  identity until Ukyo sat down with her and pointed out all the factors involved  in fabricating a new identity. Ranko was fortunate in not having a real past to  hide at the same time, but a whole host of legal problems presented themselves  as a result of her basically appearing out of nowhere. Such things mattered  little in terms of the wandering life style she had known as Ranma, but even  then the proper paperwork and documentation had existed that allowed Ranma to  cross international borders, attend school, work, etc. Without such  documentation, Ranko would never be able to function on her own. She would be  dependant on others who were established and willing to bend the rules to  accommodate her, either as a guest like in the Tendo home, working "under  the table" as she had for Cologne at the Cat Café, or at worst being forced  into a life of crime one way or another simply to support herself.</p><p>Ranko munched on a rice cake,  waiting for Cologne or Nodoka to elaborate. Cologne noted the girl's patience  with concealed approval, wondering if this was a true sign of growth, or if the  girl simply did not know what question to blurt out first. With a slight  chuckle, she picked up where Nodoka left off, "While you kids were kept  out of the loop, you might have noticed when your mother and I went through the  records at the Guide's hut. As I mentioned back in Nerima, I had a suspicion  that one of your ancestors might have had an encounter with the Nyanniichuan,  to explain your mother's appearance. In addition, you mother confided that her  father told her tales about the Joketsuzoku while she was growing up,  indicating that he might have visited our tribe prior to her birth."</p><p>Ranko tilted her head and considered  that, "So, you were looking to see if he showed up in the guest  book?"</p><p>"Correct. Fortunately, his  visit predated the register that was stolen by Taro, and that record was still  in the archive," Cologne replied, taking another sip of her tea. With a  gesture to Nodoka, she continued, "On a first look, it seemed my theory  was wrong, since his name did not show up. However, your mother recognized his  penmanship in a different name. An obvious alias. A man, who fit the general  description of you in masculine form, and possessing a nyanniichuan curse, who  signed his name as 'Lo Shen'." Cologne paused as Ranko jerked at the name  and stared at her in disbelief. "Oh, yes. I was rather startled myself.  But I seriously doubt HE could have survived fifteen hundred years while hardly  aging a decade. With a little effort, we found a picture of your grandfather in  the archive. The man must have been in his twenties when he arrived, and the  dates of the picture and the entry were both a year before your mother's birth.  From the notes of the Guide of that era, he sought the Chuanshontsuniichuan  intending to test the legend of salting the water and using it to split himself  into male and female incarnations.</p><p>"But, before he could, he was  confronted by the Musk, his curse was locked and 'she' was abducted.  Apparently, word of your grandfather's curse and skill as a warrior had reached  the Musk, and they had been pursing him as a prospective bride," Cologne  revealed. With a deep sigh, she went into detail. The story was put together  from a combination of Jusenkyo, Joketsuzoku and Musk archives—the last  solicited through Herb, who was equally curious to know how Ranma/Ranko and  their mother were born in the image of Fa Shen. Not surprisingly, Herb's father  had brought the information containing all the real answers, on the condition  that he be allowed to examine Nodoka. "He had kept the story of his attempt  to marry this 'Lo Shen' a secret. Only the possibility that Nodoka was his  daughter lured him down from his palace."</p><p>Ranko stared at her mother in  disbelief, "His… DAUGHTER!"</p><p>Nodoka flushed to her roots,  wondering if her face matched her hair as well as her daughter's did at the  moment.</p><p>"How could he think you were  his… No! Your mother was…!"</p><p>"My father," Nodoka  breathed in shame. Clearing her throat, when several moments passed as Ranko  fought to regain her voice, she clarified, "That much we do know now. My  father escaped from the Musk, after stealing the Kaisuifuu, but he did not use  it until after I was born. The amazons had heard of the theft and pursued in  hopes of recovering the kettle for themselves. They were not able to find my  father, but they did learn that I was born and the kettle hidden at Mount  Horiisan after my father was unlocked. My 'mother's' death was a story made up  to conceal the truth about my father's ordeal and keep his curse a  secret."</p><p>"I don't believe it!"  Ranko shouted, turning on Cologne. "For one thing, if this is all true,  how come you didn't know about any of this!"</p><p>Cologne did a fair job of blushing  herself, as she responded to the challenge, "Well, there is a fair bit of  irony to that part of the story. You see, I led that mission to Japan. The  confusion comes in with what we did and did not know at the time. The first we  learned of the incident was when a woman arrived in the village pursued by Musk  warriors. Physically, she resembled Nodoka in stature and age, and she had dyed  her hair black. The disguise was good enough that she did not bring Fa Shen to  mind, and she never let on that she was cursed. What struck me at the time was  that she was familiar with our customs, avoided conflict with any of the women  here, and was desperate to escape from the Musk. It was a situation we had  dealt with for generations, whenever some outsider girl was so unfortunate as  to fall into their hands, and we took pleasure in frustrating her pursuers.  Only the fact that she was reputed to have made off with one of the Musk  treasures inspired us to follow after her."</p><p>Cologne chuckled to herself and took  another drink. "Initially, she was not that difficult to track. But when  we first caught up to her, she had shed her disguise in order to book passage  to Japan. We would have lost her then if we had not literally run into her. At  the time, we assumed her change in appearance was the disguise, since the only  place where an oriental woman could pass as normal with your coloring, Ranko,  is here in this village. In practical terms, it made sense, since with that  shocking red hair, no one could hope to remember her features. The problem was,  she still wore clothing we had given her, making it easy to confirm her  identity. We confronted her, demanding she hand over the kettle. She proved a  formidable opponent when we tried to capture her, managing to escape without  incurring a kiss of death. A technicality, since she maneuvered us into  knocking each other out!"</p><p>Cologne cackled loudly at the  memory, "Oh, she was a feisty one! An expert with a sword and quite  skilled in chi manipulation. She even managed to reverse a Hiryu Shoten Ha on  me! That leaves little doubt where some of your own talent comes from, Child.  But, by the time my party came to, she had left the country. Her trail was  growing cold by the time we made it to Japan. It took us too long to track her  down.</p><p>"We arrived in Okayama  Prefecture, and when we asked around for a woman fitting her description, we  were pointed to her grave, told that she had died in childbirth, and that her  husband had taken their daughter and moved on," Cologne paused to study  Nodoka. With a heavy sigh, she concluded, "That was only six months after  the woman first appeared in the village, so there can be no doubt she was  impregnated while a prisoner of the Musk. As impressed as we were by the woman,  we considered adopting her daughter, assuming the 'father' would be happy to  rid himself of a bastard and a girl. Because of that, and on the assumption that  he had taken possession of the kettle, we continued pursuit."</p><p>Nodoka made a noise of discomfort,  drawing attention to herself.</p><p>Cologne looked at her and grinned,  "Well, if we had known then what we know now, we would have understood the  man's protectiveness of you. When we tracked him down, he had completed his  mission to hide the kaisuifuu. Not surprisingly, he recognized us all at once,  and did not hesitate to inform us that he was aware of our customs. He refused  our demands to hand over the girl and the kettle. The kettle, he claimed, was  safely hidden, and he gave us a choice. We could continue to pursue him and his  daughter, or we could search for the kettle, and to encourage us, he told us  the location to search. I decided, if the kettle was hidden, the first priority  was to rescue the girl. After all, it seemed a terrible fate to let her be  raised by a man in a patriarchal society like Japan."</p><p>Ranko considered that. "You  know, with just the general location, Mousse, Ryouga and I would have found the  kettle on our own if we'd had the time to look for it. I mean, talk about  stupid hiding places! A giant stone kettle sitting on the peak of a mountain  spring? Talk about obvious!"</p><p>Cologne harrumphed, "Well, in  point of fact, we never did go to Mount Horiisan. It was enough to know where  to look for it, and the Musk certainly had no clue where to begin  looking."</p><p>"So, you planned to adopt my  mom, but it's kinda obvious you never did. What happened?"</p><p>Cologne sighed, "As you can  imagine, he did not dare to fight us. He would have to have beaten at least one  of us, and it would not have pained us to gain a worthy husband in addition to  the daughter of a worthy woman. Instead, he tricked us. In hindsight, I realize  what he did; using his curse, he confronted us as the ghost of the girl's  mother. With the chi techniques at his disposal, he was able to project his  image, to make himself seem a convincing phantom. You can hardly blame us,  after we were thrashed by a dead woman, for deciding it best not to invite  further wrath. It amused us to think of the poor man haunted by this vengeful  spirit, forever watching over the girl."</p><p>Ranko and Nodoka stared wide-eyed at  that.</p><p>In the lull, Ranko heard a  disembodied snatch of conversation echo in the room. The voices were instantly  recognizable as that of Fa Shen and Shampoo, as the former asked the latter  about her intentions.</p><p>"…just want to know if you are  in on it, Shampoo."</p><p>"No. Mousse decide to do his  self," the other girl retorted. "Also, is only training now. Even  Mousse not know if he want still challenge Ranko, but he say he ready to  challenge if Shampoo try anything with Ranko again."</p><p>"You're kidding? Are you sure  he isn't planning on challenging you directly? I mean, after your marriage was  dissolved, and your claim to Ranko forfeited, it's not unlikely he would want  another shot at you."</p><p>"Is possible, but Mousse must  wait one more month before he can challenge Shampoo again," she informed  solemnly, though whether because she was troubled by the deadline or the delay  was unclear.</p><p>Ranko blinked, turning around to  pinpoint where the voices were coming from, and found herself looking at a vent  in the floor. With shock, she realized that Cologne's study was directly over  the dining room. The pair of amazons downstairs must have just entered the  room, after completing their work in the kitchen. The vent in the floor was  meant to channel heat from the hearth in the room below, but sound was  conducted just as effectively. With a sinking feeling, she turned to look at  the two older women in the room, as her mind flashed back over the conversation  she had participated in earlier. Had the voices of Ranko, Ranma, Ryouga and Fa  Shen carried as clearly as this?</p><p>One look at the composed faces of  Cologne and Nodoka, as they took in the pale of shock on Ranko's face, answered  that question. With a painful gulp, Ranko stammered, "Y-you d-di-didn't  c-call m-m-me in h-here to t-t-t-talk a-ab…"</p><p>"About your grandfather?"  Cologne finished for her, with a guarded expression. At Ranko's nod, she  sighed, "As a matter of fact, we did wish to talk to you about that. But.  As you fear, Nodoka and I did happen to overhear something rather shocking over  the past hour or so. I confess, we did not wish to eaves drop, but we could  hardly ignore what the four of you were discussing."</p><p>Ranko curled up on herself and  shuddered, "Ohgodohgodohgod!" Everything that was mentioned and  discussed with Ryouga roared through her mind. All the secrets the trio was  desperately afraid of their mother finding out, had been spilled out on the  floor. At the thought of their life's blood and viscera following suit, Ranko  simply keeled over unconscious.</p><p>Afternoon  had settled in warm and beautiful, resplendent in a riot of early spring vigor.  Vibrant green shoots shot up from the rich dark soil, pushing aside the dull  grey and gold debris of last season's decaying plant life. The heady scent of  nature's potpourri filled Akane's nose as she wandered the outskirts of the  village. It barely penetrated the haze of bitterness that dragged her angry  thoughts into furrows of depression. If she could just bring herself to face  the hurt that fertilized her rage, she might break out of the dangerous cycle,  but every time she allowed her thoughts to return to the shocking image that  seared her mind, she recoiled violently from the stab of betrayal.</p><p>In the wake of discovering that  Ranma was cheating on her with Fa Shen, with shut-eye chaperonage from Ranko,  Akane had discovered new depths of pain and anger. It rivaled the betrayal of  P-Chan being revealed as the cursed form of Ryouga at the same time she learned  that the lost boy had slept with Ranma.</p><p>It was disturbing how these things  always seemed to come down to timing and the incredible perversity of fate. A  nagging voice inside her kept asking her if what she had caught them doing that  morning had been going on all along, or if she had just happened to stumble  along just in time to catch Ranma trying sex for the first time as a male? She  keenly remembered her justification for attempting to have sex as a boy with a  girl Ryouga. She had been desperate to know if she was even capable of that  kind of intimacy with a female, for Ranma's sake. Why would Ranma, or Fa Shen  for that matter, be any different? What normal girl or boy would not  wonder—after the sort of experiences those two had in their new bodies—if they  were still capable of performing in the roles they were born to? What kind of  moron would blame them for trying to find out? That was why she had refused to listen  to any excuses from them. If she was forced to forgive them, she would have  nothing to be angry with them about. She would have to face the pain she felt  without that familiar protection.</p><p>It was so obvious, in retrospect,  that it made Akane furious that she had not anticipated it. Or was that,  because she had anticipated it instantly, when the first reflection entered  their lives and set her sights on Ranma? Maybe she had some suspicion from the  very beginning, when she blurted in outrage, "He's a couple by HIMSELF!" at the  time of their engagement.</p><p>Deep within, Akane's conscience was  adding fuel to the fury, reminding her that it was not Ranma's fault he had  taken over copy-Ranko just when she was losing her virginity. Akane was the one  to blame for that date ever happening, and it had been eating at her since. She  was not sure who to blame for the fact that Ranma had to have sex again—also as  a girl, and with the male Fa Shen—in order to heal Ranko. And maybe, she was  not really angry with Ranma at all. Maybe she was really just afraid. What was  love but the thread that wove a pair of unfinished souls into something whole,  complete? How could Akane compete… how could she even have a hope of completion  in Ranma, when Ranma was so obviously capable of completing himself?</p><p>But these thoughts were too deep,  too disturbing for her mind to cope with. It was just too confusing, and the  note of depression only grew stronger as she reflected on the most recent  addition to her unhappy musings.</p><p>Once again, she remembered the  bitter sound of Ranko's voice as she stormed away from the path to the  tournament ground, promising, "I'll deal with you later, Tomboy."</p><p>Akane had fled from what she had  thought was another fruitless confrontation with Ranma by stepping off the path  just around the bend from where she had knocked the red-headed boy into the  ravine, in order to avoid the amazon witnesses to the fight. The instant she  spotted her opponent's female form stalking by, and reflexively hid behind a  tree, she had known that she had made a mistake.</p><p>Of the three who had hurt her, Ranko  was the only one Akane had a hope of reconciling with. The only one she might  have allowed herself to listen to, anyway. She desired it too, desperate to  know what had motivated the girl to cover for her siblings in their perverted  activities, but even more concerned with warning the girl of both Ranma's gross  intentions as well as the initial threat of Mousse's training. She still wanted  to kick herself for forgetting her original reason for confronting Ranko that  morning. But when Ranko came to her, intent on trying to clear things up, Akane  had blown whatever hope of reconciliation she had out of the water.</p><p>That was reason enough for her to  flee from the village in despair. It was just the kick in the head she needed  to start thinking again, and unfortunately, the first thing she thought of was  the possible consequence of clobbering Ranko. She knew all too well how  powerfully influenced her present and former fiancés were by their sense of  honor. She had no idea how that would mix with Fa Shen's background and their  new allegiance to the amazon tribe. She had no idea how likely they were to  follow through on something like the kiss of death, and however much she wanted  to believe the three would refuse to obey that aspect of amazon law she was  painfully conscious of how they had already reacted to matters involving the  kiss of marriage. In and of themselves, Ranma and Ranko were not killers, but  Fa Shen was, and the other two were drawing more and more from their former  self.</p><p>Akane felt, with growing dread and  disgust, that the three would carry out that fatal duty if there was no way for  them avoid it.</p><p>Thus, instead of returning to the  village to find Ranko, she haunted the outskirts brooding. She was almost  positive that she had not provoked a kiss of death. Almost. She felt enough  trepidation that she did not want to test it. But all that left her was plenty  of time to do nothing but perch on a boulder sinking into a pit of anger and  depression. The aura surrounding her had become thick and cloying, a deep teal  shot through with waves of blue and green. If it were just rage and  frustration, she would have blown it all off in her outbursts against Ranma and  Ranko, but the underlying pain had not abated and continued to feed the demons  of Akane's passion.</p><p>It was much easier to blind herself  with rage. With Ranma constantly harassing her, it was so easy to keep the  anger alive, to lash out. But it also blinded her to the fact that it hurt her  more than him, and that pain just fed back into her anger. So, there really was  nothing she could have done to prevent what her fatal preoccupation was about  to bring down on her.</p><p>On one level, she was feeling the  pressure building in and around her, so it was an instinctive response to grasp  for some way to vent her emotions. Because of her isolation, her normal method  could not be applied. There was no one to beat on, and she had long since given  up on breaking rocks and trees when that gave her no relief. She was simply  itching to let it all off in one great explosion, and she had observed the  method that came to her so many times she did not even have to think of it. For  the same reason, any normal doubts she might have had about being able to  perform such a technique herself was completely bypassed. The impulse struck  her, and before she knew it, she had cupped her hands in front of her abdomen  and allowed the massive cloak of chi to funnel into a globe between them. What  she did notice, as the ki attack reached critical mass, was that her mind  suddenly became clear and focused. She had a split second to realize that she  had powered up a devastating attack and had it aimed directly into the village.</p><p>With a squawk of awe and terror, she  shifted her stance and directed the swelling ball of chi to fire off directly  overhead, in perfect imitation of Ryouga's ultimate final attack. Once the rush  of power had ascended into the heavens, she continued to stand in disbelief  with her tingling arms pointed to the sky. "I don't believe it," she  gasped. How many times had Ranma—or rather, Ranko—commented on what Akane could  do with her powerful aura, if she could only manage to harness it? "I just  threw a ki attack!"</p><p>For an instant, all of her troubles  were wiped from her mind as pride in her accomplishment surged through her.  Then she noticed that the glowing ball in the sky had stopped diminishing and  now appeared to be growing again.</p><p>"Wha…" she squinted her  eyes. A cold chill ran down her spine, and sweat popped out on her brow.  "Ohmygod. It's coming back down!" she cried in a panic, turning to  race away from ground zero. To her shock, she felt something twist around and  then bite into her ankle, some tangle of weeds that used her own motion to twine  around her leg and trip her. As she fell onto her face, she reflexively covered  her head and prayed to survive her own debut attack.</p><p>It never even occurred to her that  there might be a hidden danger, something far more insidious than the risk of  being crushed, charred or blasted in the detonation of spiritual energy. The  harsh lesson Ryouga had learned had not really sunk in, since until that moment  Akane would never have considered herself at risk. It was only as a  disturbingly familiar tingle sang through her body, as she was flattened and  seared by the heavy, burning manifestation of her own anger and depression,  that she remembered the Instant Nanniichuan and the residue it had left in her  chi. In the same way Ryouga had resurrected his Heitonniichuan curse by  powering up his perfect shishihokodan, Akane had breathed new life into the  ashes of the magic that had touched her, and inadvertently turned it on  herself. The only difference, however, was that she did not have a curse that  would allow her to reverse the effect.</p><p>By the time the villagers arrived on  the scene, drawn by the sight and explosive sound of the massive detonation of  chi, the battered young 'man' lying in the center of the crater had stopped  convulsing in pain and begun shuddering in misery.</p>
