</div>It's All In The Reflexes<p>A  Reflections Mini-Sequel</p><p>A. V.  Morgan</p><p>Part  Eleven</p><p>Upon his  return to camp, while his father summoned the guard to prepare for their visit  to the amazon village, Prince Herb was approached by the captain of his  personal guard. Setting down the kettle he had used to restore himself to his  proper form, Herb allowed himself a congratulatory smirk as he regarded the  kneeling form of the man who had recently been the victim of amazon law. In  hindsight, they both knew it had not been necessary for Kai Yuan to strike down  the amazon Ai Xiadou during their confrontation outside of Jusenkyo. Still, it  had proved a profitable misunderstanding. When she had jumped forward in shock  at learning about the reincarnation of Fa Shen, the Musk captain had reacted  instinctively to the perceived attack on his prince and knocked her  unconscious. When she recovered and gave him the Kiss of Marriage, Herb had  commanded the man to abide by the amazons' marriage law rather than be  distracted from his pursuit of the Saotome offspring. Kai Yuan had accompanied  his bride back to her village, and in this way Herb had gained a very reliable  informant within the village itself. Combined with the intelligence Herb gained  through the jilted master of hidden weapons, there was very little chance Fa Shen  and her siblings would be able to spring any surprises on the Musk Prince.  Gesturing to his soldier, Herb commanded, "Rise and report."</p><p>Kai Yuan straightened gracefully to  his full height. "My Lord Prince, I have unpleasant news to present to  you."</p><p>Herb smothered a scowl. "I have  heard much that displeases me of late. I assure you I will not hold you  accountable if there is no direct failure on your part, Kai Yuan."</p><p>The captain nodded faintly. "I  have just learned from my wife this morning that one of the outlanders was not  all she seemed. Apparently she has been revealed to be a man in disguise, and  actively pursued those you seek to wed for his own bride. As I was finishing my  breakfast, a woman visited my wife claiming that he defeated Fa Shen this  morning and she gave him the Kiss of Marriage. As per your orders, I departed  at once to come warn you of this development."</p><p>Herb cursed softly under his breath.  "I was led to believe that the one who turns into a pig and a woman was  interested in Ranma."</p><p>"I beg your pardon, my Lord  Prince," Kai Yuan sweated nervously. "The one you speak of, who goes  by the name, Ryouga, is not the one I refer to. I speak of the one called Akane  Tendo." He then proceeded to relate the story one of his wife friends had relayed  in his presence to her, with far less amusement and enthusiasm than she.</p><p>Herb tightened his fists. Mousse had  mentioned Akane's tendency to lash out at her fiancé, Ranma, and how this habit  had been viewed by the amazons. Herb foolishly took the blind boy's word that  Akane's attentions were entirely fixated on Ranma, but obviously one mistaken  blow was all that had been necessary to foil Herb's pursuit of Fa Shen.  Pinching the bridge of his nose, to stave off a sudden headache, he prompted, "What  of the other one, Ranko? I was led to believe that she had abandoned her claim  to the pig."</p><p>"My Lord Prince, if the rumors  I have heard are correct, she was accidentally split in two, divided into male  and female incarnations. I have not been able to confirm this, however, and  that is all I have heard concerning her," the man declared with  conviction.</p><p>Herb considered that and nodded.  "It would be difficult for anyone to keep track of them from a distance.  Unless there is anything else you need to report, that will be all," he  dismissed the soldier. Kai Yuan bowed deeply and excused himself, leaving Herb  to think about this latest problem. Clearly, time was a luxury he did not have  any more. Seeing the guards forming up to leave the camp, he shouted for Mousse  to be brought to him.</p><p>His retainers recognized his tone  and made haste.</p><p>"You wished to see me, Prince  Herb?" Mousse asked timidly, a short while later, straightening his robes  and pushing his glasses up after being snatched from his tent and dragged  swiftly before Herb by Lime and Mint.</p><p>Herb looked up and nodded.  "That is correct. I have received news that Fa Shen has been joined to  Akane in marriage this morning. As this satisfies your demand that a marriage  between her and Shampoo be thwarted, our business is concluded."</p><p>Mousse blinked in surprise, though  one could hardly tell through the thick lenses covering his eyes, then nodded  in understanding. "Well. I never expected that, but I suppose you are  correct."</p><p>"Furthermore, I wished to  apologize to you," Herb added with an evil smirk. The small hand gestures  he made to his loyal retainers slipped past the stunned and oblivious Mousse.</p><p>"Apologize?" he asked in  confusion.</p><p>"That is correct," Herb  bowed slightly. At that gesture, Mousse was doused from behind by Lime by an  all too familiar magic ladle. As the duck struggled to escape the collapsing  bulk of suddenly engulfing robes, Mint's hand flashed out to seize him by the  neck and thrust him into a small cage. Herb bent close as the duck quacked in  angry indignation, and explained, "I remember the way you interfered in my  plans in Japan, and I can no longer afford to be thwarted by your misguided and  indecisive loyalties. I doubt you would make good on your threat to claim Ranko  before I could, seeing that would be counter to your intention to wed Shampoo,  but it is still a threat I can not ignore. Once I have secured my bride, I  assure you that you will be released with no hard feelings."</p><p>With a curt gesture, he dismissed  his retainers to arrange more secure restraints for the master of hidden  weapons and marched in the direction of his father's pavilion, erected during  Herb's absence that morning.</p><p>Spice was just emerging from his  tent with Cinnamon when Herb confronted him. He delivered a brief summary of  the report he had received and asked his father the most pertinent question he  could think of. "Father, I am still under your orders to claim a Saotome  bride, so tell me, will the outcome of Cinnamon's examination alter your command?"</p><p>Spice regarded his son and frowned.  He understood the question Herb was really asking. If Ranko was proven to be  Herb's niece, did that necessarily exclude her as a bridal candidate? It was a  necessary question. Spice had automatically rejected the thought of an  incestuous union, but in point of fact, such were hardly uncommon in royal  marriages. There had been pairings between individuals even more closely  related in the past, in order to strengthen or preserve the imperial bloodline.  The Musk had no qualms about culling the defective offspring of such  inbreeding, in order to purify the line. Spice met his son's eyes and nodded.  "I believe a half niece is suitable for our purposes. Issue your  challenge, Son."</p><p>Herb nodded sternly, keeping his  reaction off his face. He had not lied to Ranko when he confessed that he did  not relish the prospect of marrying her. But he had been equally honest about  his loyalty to his father. At least Ranko was more of a woman than Ranma had  been, and if the second rumor Kai Yuan reported was to be believed, she had  even been stripped of the taint of manhood. Another note on the plus side, with  Ranma and Fa Shen both married they would be forbidden to interfere in the  marriage challenge, which meant Herb would not have to face the devastating  power Ranko reportedly gained from her sibling's fornication.</p><p>Herb began formulating his battle  plans as his party marched to the amazon village. First and foremost, he would  be dealing with two opponents, since Ranko's male twin would not be barred from  the fight. That would work to his advantage, since it gave Herb the opportunity  to kill that twin and guarantee that Ranko would not be able to turn into a man  again. Herb had not been told that Ranko had been split with salted twins'  water, but that seemed the most likely method. Herb had known of it and  considered using it to rid himself of his girl half, until his father  threatened to marry his girl half off if he attempted it. Again, for the sake  of the bloodline, Herb would never be allowed to simply dispose of his girl  half when by herself she represented excellent breeding stock. It forced Herb  to realize that he could easily find himself trapped in that body looking out  at a cured version of himself. It was pure folly to ignore the true curse of  the Chuanshontsuniichuan.</p><p>He still shuddered whenever he  thought of it.</p><p>Herb had become lost in his plotting  by the time their party arrived at the gates of the amazon village. The  commotion caused by the appearance of an armed contingent of Musk warriors,  their emperor, and prince, roused him from his distraction in time to look up  and notice the red-headed girl racing toward them from the opposite branch of  the road.</p><p>As she  approached, Onna-Ranko made a quick head-count of the Musk party. To her  extreme displeasure, there seemed to be twice as many warriors as she had seen  when she stumbled into Herb on the edge of Jusenkyo several days earlier.  Cursing under her breath, she shifted her attention to the center of the group,  where she confirmed her initial sighting of Herb, and noticed that he was  accompanied by strangers instead of the familiar Lime and Mint. Both of them  were garbed in the finery and armor she had come to associate with Musk  royalty. One was a tall, broad-shouldered man bearing an obvious resemblance to  Herb, whom Ranko guessed might be his father. The other could not be identified  through the concealing folds of a hood and cloak.</p><p>The presence of the man gave Ranko  pause. She remembered the story she had been told the day before, that it was  possible that Herb's father was also Nodoka's father. It was possible, if this  was him, that this visit had nothing to do with Herb's challenge to Fa Shen.  Her confusion must have shown, because Herb turned to look right at her and smiled  his superior, amused smile. Ranko slowed from a sprint to a jog as he pushed  through the guards to intercept her at the gates. His movement distracted Ranko  from taking a closer look at the cloaked figure striding along side of Herb's  father. Ranko stopped a few meters in front of Herb, shifting into a defensive  posture and challenged, "Herb! What are you doing here!"</p><p>Herb spread his arms out, hands  empty, and responded, "Greetings, Saotome. I am here for two reasons.  First, I am here with my father to determine the lineage of your mother.  Second, I am here to change the status of my challenge…" He trailed off  with a pointed look.</p><p>"Oh? So, you're giving up on Fa  Shen?" she lowered her arms from their guard position, relaxing her  posture and giving him a suspicious look.</p><p>Herb smirked. "You could say  that."</p><p>"Perhaps you would care to  introduce yourself," Emperor Spice prompted stepping up beside Herb. The  prince automatically deferred to his father, making a brief introduction and  allowing him to take the initiative for the moment.</p><p>Ranko shifted her attention to the  man who had sired the arrogant prince. The man who might be her real  grandfather. At close range, she was engulfed by his powerful presence. Her  eyes were captured by the sight of his thick mane of white hair, piercing amber  eyes, and stern features. Through the folds of his imperial robes and armor,  she could make out the body of a man in his prime, a strong, tall frame corded  with powerful muscles. He had all the strengths of a young man, but he exuded  the wisdom and experience of an amazon elder. A fight with him, she instantly  decided, would be the challenge of a life-time. With those eyes boring into  hers, it did not even occur to her to dissemble. "Ranko. Saotome Ranko. I  was Ranma when Herb met me," she volunteered.</p><p>"So. You are the one who  defeated my son and then saved his life. I have been waiting to meet you,  Ranko." He gave her a slight nod and the ghost of a smile. "You are  not exactly the cocky young man my son led me to expect."</p><p>Ranko smirked brashly, "You  mean the guy you were planning to force into marrying Herb? You maybe wanna  explain that, Old Man?"</p><p>"I am not in the habit of  explaining myself to anyone, Child," Spice grinned, tightening his fists.  The arrogance was so familiar. He was fighting to contain his reaction to the  sight of her. Seeing Cinnamon should have prepared him for this meeting.  "You are, without question, Kenshin's grandchild. However, it remains to  be seen if you are also mine. I believe we shall address that question before  we consider your impudence, Ranko. Cinnamon?" he prompted the hooded woman  standing just behind and between himself and his son.</p><p>Cinnamon did not respond. She had  been lost in her own thoughts as Herb moved to meet Ranko, and had absently  followed Spice's lead when he joined the dragon prince. She had not even  reacted to the sound of Ranko's voice as she challenged Herb, since the same  voice had long become rooted in Cinnamon's mind as the sound of her own voice.  It took her a moment to realize the words had not merely echoed in her head and  look up from the depths of her cowl. Once her eyes fell upon the girl,  Cinnamon's breath stopped. The face, the form, she had seen on so many in her  long life. The spirit that animated it, however, had too long been absent from  Cinnamon's world. Recognition had been instant. The dragon's ki senses unfurled  and swept out to taste her, and were stunned to pick up several other presences  that also could only be identified as Fa Shen.</p><p>"Cinnamon?" Ranko asked,  tilting her head and trying to get a look at the woman the emperor had just  addressed. "Say, who is this? Herb's big sister?" she asked, as she  allowed herself a closer look at the clothing and cloak that obscured the  stranger's identity.</p><p>"Tsin-Na Minh," the dragon  corrected softly.</p><p>Ranko's pony-tail stood straight up,  and electricity slithered up her spine at the proper pronunciation of that  name. It was a familiar reaction, though she had only experienced it first hand  when someone uttered the word "cat". It was a primal reaction, one  that surged out of the depths of her psyche like tsunami.</p><p>Cinnamon lifted her head and pushed  the cowl back, "But then, you wouldn't recognize me like this, would you,  Fa Shen?"</p><p>"It'sa- it'sa- it'sa… You! Y-you're  the…" Ranko babbled, pale as a sheet and practically gnawing on her fist  as she fought to stand her ground.</p><p>"Dragon," Cinnamon smiled.  "It's nice to see you remember my name. I was never sure you did, after…  well. You were rather traumatized by what happened next." She fought not  to laugh at the shudder that rattled Ranko, as she referred to her attempt to  eat the amazon girl. She pushed forward through the gap between Herb and Spice.  Ranko flinched, but the person approaching her did not inspire any of the  terror evoked by her name. If anything, the sight of a slightly older version  of herself was faintly fascinating. It was encouraging to think that  resemblance meant she might grow as tall. Cinnamon paused at arms length, and  scrutinized her carefully. "You're almost exactly the way I remember you.  But," her thoughts began to catch up to her, reminding her of what she had  overheard but tuned out, "you called yourself Ranko. You ARE Fa Shen, are  you not?"</p><p>Ranko gulped. Her brain had gone to  work, and began to puzzle out exactly how Fa Shen's nemesis could be  confronting her now, in her present form. The part of her that was Fa Shen was  utterly bewildered by the notion of this particular entity being the only  living tie to her past. The very idea was as bizarre as the possibility of her  own resurrection. With most of her wits scattered, Ranko answered numbly,  "It's… kinda complicated."</p><p>Cinnamon's attention was drawn to  something behind Ranko, and she gave an odd start before returning her gaze to  Ranko's face. "Indeed, it is," she quirked an eyebrow. Apparently,  her senses had not deceived her, the dragon noted silently.</p><p>Ranko felt the approach of her  siblings at the same time, as they raced up behind her and almost tripped in  surprise when they took a good look at who their sister was speaking to.</p><p>"What the HECK is goin' on  here?" Otoko-Ranko demanded.</p><p>"Hey, she looks kinda like  Mom," Ranma chirped in surprise.</p><p>"How extraordinary. They're ALL  Fa Shen!"</p><p>"We did tell you there were  three of them," Spice reminded the dragon, concealing his own surprise at  seeing the three he had heard of, yet not seen until now. Knowing of their  existence did not prepare him at all to confront them.</p><p>"Well, yes. You told me some  strange stories, but," she waved her hands at the triplets and shrugged,  "I didn't really believe it." As she studied them now, however, there  was no denying that the three of them were the same person. Back in the days  when Cinnamon was first cursed, as more and more Musk made their brides in the  Nyanniichuan, it had been common to see crowds of girls identical to Fa Shen.  The dragon had learned to distinguish individuals by their auras. The only  substantial differences between the auras of the boy and two girls before her  were transient fluctuations of mood. Even then, the auras would occasionally  synchronize and resonate, leading her to believe the triplets must experience  moments of telepathic rapport. The only thing Cinnamon knew of that would  account for that phenomenon was the twinning waters of the  Chuanshontsuniichuan. It was all the proof she needed to validate the abridged  version of their story passed on to her through Herb and Spice.</p><p>"Honestly, I had my own doubts  until just now," Spice confessed, while giving the male member of the  trinity a disconcerted look. Clearing his throat, he addressed the boy,  "From my son's account of the duel at Jusenkyo, you are the one who has  adopted the identity of Ranma."</p><p>"Uh…" the boy, who was of  course Otoko-Ranko, fumbled.</p><p>Herb interrupted and pointed up the  road that Ranko and the others had arrived down, "It appears there are  more than three of them now." Everyone looked in the direction Herb was  pointing and saw a third red-headed girl walking along sheltered in the arms of  a raven-haired girl. "I believe that is Akane Tendo walking with her, and  of course Nodoka following them. How extraordinary. You are like rabbits, every  time I turn around there are more of you. How do you manage it, Saotome?"  Herb gave Ranko a pointed look punctuated by a sarcastic, knowing smile.</p><p>"Er…" Onna-Ranko pulled at  her pony-tail and tried to look away.</p><p>At this point, Ranma cleared her  throat and raised her arm, as if she was in the middle of a classroom.  "Uh, actually, I'm Ranma." She had an irresistible urge to add  "sorry 'bout this" but managed to crush it before it slipped out.</p><p>"Sorry 'bout this,"  Otoko-Ranko blushed, then let out a yip of pain as Ranma kicked him in the shin  and glared at him.</p><p>Cinnamon bent close to Otoko-Ranko,  staring so hard it seemed like she was staring through him. She reached out and  grabbed him by the head and started to turn it in her hands while staring into  his eyes. When he was about to complain, she let go and stated, pointing from  him to Onna-Ranko, "I think this one and that one are both Ranko. They're  much more in synch."</p><p>"Chuanshontsuniichuan, this  time?" Herb prodded Onna-Ranko.</p><p>"It was an accident," she  growled, rolling her eyes and slipping away from him to latch on to her other  half.</p><p>"Isn't that always the case  with Jusenkyo?" Spice pointed out. Spice turned his attention to the last  girl. As she was led into the crowd by Akane, he examined from head to toe  while speaking, "I take it, then, that this must be Fa Shen?" Hearing  her name, Fa Shen looked up in bewilderment and then looked over at Ranma. The  look of uncertainty there spoke of more than confusion about who was addressing  her.</p><p>Ranma stiffened for a moment, before  a noticeable change passed through her. Her siblings instantly recognized the  personality shift that was triggered by the emperor's question. "We are  all Fa Shen," she corrected primly, then gestured to herself, "but  most of what remains of the original Fa Shen survives in me." A pang of  uncertainty ran through her as she said it. As far as the triplets knew, that  was literally true. So why, she suddenly wondered, had all of her decisions  recently been made from the perspective of being Ranma? A look of perplexity to  match Fa Shen's came over Ranma's face.</p><p>They continued to look at one another,  as if sharing a secret.</p><p>That was not too far from the truth,  as their minds both raced down similar paths. In spite of having figured out  the truth about the body-swapping that occurred during sex between  "Ranma" and "Fa Shen", the triplets were only partially  aware of the damage that had done to the mirror-born siblings. Both mirror  twins had been branded with two personalities, and with each swap they had  reinforced the duality of those perspectives. It would have been much worse if  they had not become aware of their reflective split personalities, but the  foundation for a complete mental schism had been laid in both of them. As long  as "Ranma" and "Fa Shen" remained separate identities, as  long as those identities were a reason for them to present themselves as  different people, the mirror twins would remain in great danger.</p><p>Everyone else had noticed the way  Ranma and Fa Shen had suddenly zoned out. Neither of them responded to any  further remarks or questions from the Musk Emperor, nor did they react to the  re-introduction of Cinnamon. While Otoko-Ranko had flinched and presented  warding signs against the revelation of who and what Cinnamon was, Ranko had  grabbed Ranma by the arm and attempted to snap her out of her trance.</p><p>"Hey, snap out of it!"  Onna-Ranko snarled under her breath. "What's the matter with you?"  She kept one eye focused on her mother, as she stepped forward to exchange  greetings with Spice, whom she had met a couple of days earlier. Seeing that no  one was paying her or Ranma any particular attention, she shook her twin  gently.</p><p>Ranma blinked and focused on Ranko's  face. "Sorry. I changed gears too fast. I got confused about who I was for  a moment," she apologized. Shaking her head, she quickly reviewed under  her breath, "For a moment I had the strongest feeling I was really  supposed to be Fa Shen, that I'd done something really, dangerously, wrong by  believing I was Ranma… Y'know, ever since that night…" Her body tensed.</p><p>"…I think I know what's going  on. When I tell you, you're not going to like it, either. But we're gonna need  some privacy first," Ranko mused, checking carefully to make sure no one  was really listening to her.  Just then  the village elders approached from within the gate to greet the visiting  royalty. "Here's our chance," Ranko observed with a cunning grin.</p><p>Backed by every warrior in the  village, the ruling council of elders took up position within the gates and  announced their presence. The Musk contingent shifted their attention toward  the shrunken women. Ranko grabbed Ranma and signaled her counterpart to follow.  He nudged Akane and whispered something to her before grabbing Fa Shen and  slipping her out of the crowd. Akane sped off in the opposite direction,  heading into the village. The formalities of a meeting between the leadership  of the two great tribes offered the perfect distraction for the teens to escape  for privacy.</p><p>After fading out of the crowd and  slipping into the woods bordering the main path, they waited for Akane to catch  up to them, dragging Ryouga, Ukyo and Shampoo in her wake. As soon as they were  certain no one else had followed, the group raced off toward the pools Ranma  had introduced his siblings to the day before. Once they had determined that  they no one was lurking in the area, they settled around the remains of last  night's camp-fire and began to talk.</p><p>"What's going on?" Fa Shen  asked, once she had oriented herself and collected her wits.</p><p>Akane finished dusting herself off  and perched on a small boulder next to Fa Shen, protectively. "Was Herb  here to challenge Fa Shen?"</p><p>"Actually," Onna-Ranko  replied, taking Akane question first, "Herb said something about giving up  on her. I dunno, maybe he has to wait until they're sure about Mom being his  sister. I don't know how they're gonna prove that, but from what I can tell  that's what they brought Cinnamon here to do…" Beside her, Otoko-Ranko  shuddered at the reminder of the shock he had received while Ranma and Fa Shen  had zoned out after talking to the Musk Emperor.</p><p>"Cinnamon?" Ranma and  Akane queried.</p><p>"Tsin-Na Minh!" Fa Shen  shouted, guessing the correct pronunciation of the stranger's name and thinking  instantly of her nemesis. "Are you saying Herb and his father brought a  DRAGON with them to the village!" It did not even occur to Fa Shen to  doubt that Tsin-Na Minh could still be around in the present day and age, nor  that he might be an ally of the Musk. What shook her was the notion that she  could have missed seeing him.</p><p>Onna-Ranko, becoming almost as pale  as Fa Shen and Otoko-Ranko had suddenly become, nodded and swallowed hard.  "I'm pretty sure that's who she is. She brought up some stuff from when I  was you… er… well, you know what I mean."</p><p>"She?" Fa Shen looked  puzzled.</p><p>"She's been cursed. I mean, she  looks like us. That is, if we were as old as Kasumi," Ranko clarified.</p><p>"That girl is a dragon?"  Ranma frowned. She had been so preoccupied with her brief personality shift she  had not really taken notice of the cursed young woman. Of course, if she had  realized who was being introduced to her while she had been "Fa Shen"  her reaction would probably have spelled disaster. "I'm surprised you  didn't try and kill her, Ranko," she confessed, turning to the other girl.</p><p>"It's sorta funny, but in her  cursed form she didn't feel all that threatening," Onna-Ranko explained  with a shrug. Just the same, she understood the point of Ranma's question.  While Fa Shen's fear of dragons did not result in something like the Neko-Ken,  it did spur a powerful fight or flight response. Fa Shen might well have tried  to kill Cinnamon on sight, if she recognized the dragon in human form, to take  advantage of its vulnerability. "I've changed enough from Fa Shen that I  wouldn't react like that. I'm used to suppressing the Neko-Ken. "</p><p>Fa Shen shuddered once more. The  memory of diving into the dragon's throat to escape from the deadly teeth that  were snapping closed around her remained vivid and terrifying. That move had  offered only a moment's reprieve, and the panic that gripped her as she slithered  into the belly of the beast nearly paralyzed her long enough to seal her fate.  Her aura had burst free in the tight confines, compressing into a wall of force  that protected her from the crushing force of its rock-filled gizzard and the  searing touch of its digestive juices. Even that was not enough to save her, as  air was in limited supply. She called on reserves she did not even know she had  to generate enough force to send her body rocketing back up the predator's  esophagus. She had been fortunate that the pain and shock of this maneuver  forced the dragon to open its jaws while triggering the fury of its fiery  breath.</p><p>Fa Shen had been launched toward the  horizon, trailing flames and glowing with furious chi, a living comet that hit  the ground and kept running for dear life even though she was already drained  nearly to the point of death.</p><p>So, no, it was not a mistake to  believe she would slay the dragon instantly if she saw the opportunity, purely  to guarantee she would never have to go through that horrific experience ever  again. Then again, she felt mortified to admit to that level of sheer, animal  terror. Clearing her throat, she opined, "Maybe as long as she doesn't  look like a dragon, I won't freak out. I mean, she's got my body now, right?  What could possibly be threatening about that?"</p><p>Ryouga nervously reached out and  patted her arm, "Believe me, I know where you're coming from. I've come  close to being eaten too many times myself. I mean, really, I was so upset  about that I seriously wanted to kill Ranma for giving me that curse!"</p><p>"It was Pop's fault!"  Ranma and both Rankos complained.</p><p>"But YOU knocked me off that  cliff!" Ryouga snarled.</p><p>"I didn't even SEE you! I told  you, Ryouga…"</p><p>"Stop it! All of you!"  Akane roared, jumping to her feat and leaning over them with her fists  clenched. "When are you going to get over this! I can't believe you'd  start fighting about this after all that's happened!"</p><p>"Jeez, Akane. Overreact much?  This isn't fighting, it's more like foreplay with this group," Ukyo  grumbled irritably. Turning to look at Fa Shen, she returned to the main  question, "So, Herb's off your case, anyway. Pretty strange, considering I  wouldn't have put it past him to try and marry you even if you turned out to be  his own sister."</p><p>Fa Shen snorted, "He is Musk.  I'd be more likely to believe he learned about Akane clobbering me. I wouldn't  put it past him to have found out about the Kiss of Marriage that quickly.  Thanks to Jusenkyo, he could have all sorts of spies on us and we'd never know  it! And, if that is the case, he'd probably follow through on his threat to  challenge Ranko next."</p><p>Onna-Ranko nodded glumly. "Now  that you mention it, Herb was interrupted by his pop before I could get a  straight answer outta him." She took a very deep breath and let it out  slowly. "If that's the case, I'll deal with it when it comes up. Right  now, though, I'm more worried about you guys," she declared, pushing her  other concerns aside. "Ranma, Fa Shen… after yesterday, I'm kinda worried  about what's goin' on with you."</p><p>"Feh," Ranma waved it off,  leaning her shoulder against Ryouga's. "There isn't anything to be worried  about now. Mom's okay with me bein' with Ryouga. That's all that matters to me.  Well, she IS makin' noises about makin' me be some kinda 'Woman-Among-Women' or  somethin'. That's a little disturbing, but I think things are gonna get better  from now on."</p><p>Fa Shen added, with a rueful smile,  "And, technically, the pact with the Tendo's has been honored. Our fathers  will probably put on a big wedding with me as the groom to make everything  legal in Japan. I don't see any way to avoid that now. I am sorry, Akane."</p><p>Akane flushed and looked down.  "It's not your fault," she muttered through grinding teeth.  "Between my temper and jumping to conclusions, there's no way to blame  you. You did try to warn me, and you were only trying to help me out. I guess  I'm the one who needs to be apologizing." It surprised her how little  effort it took to admit all of that. She did not know if she was accepting this  so calmly because Fa Shen was really a girl, or because she was also the Ranma  she had made peace with the night of the double date. Looking up, she added,  "If anything, I should be thanking you. You could have given me the Kiss  of Death. I guess I'm pretty lucky I cursed myself after all. It's got the  amazons really thinking I'm a man. I'd be pretty screwed if they realized the  truth!"</p><p>Ukyo stood up and marched to the  edge of the water. When she spoke, the others could tell she was close to  losing control. "Well, that's just bleeding fantastic. It looks like  everything is working out fine for everybody who matters. I'm sure you'll all  be really happy in your new lives."</p><p>"Ucchan…"</p><p>"No! I'm sick of it!" Ukyo  whipped around, glaring at everyone through a film of tears. "You never,  ever, took me seriously. You've been stringing me along from the very  beginning! You call me the cute fiancée, but you always have this excuse that  you just can't see me as anything but a friend! Akane and Ryouga go and get themselves  curses to go with yours and you just fall for it, but when I promise you I'd do  the same for you, you tell me it's wrong! You tell me it won't make any  difference in the way you feel about me, and that you 'don't want me to get  hurt'!"</p><p>"But, Ukyo…"</p><p>"Shut UP!" she shouted at  the top of her lungs. "Get a clue, you jackasses! I AM getting HURT! What  does it matter that I can't even claim to be a woman unless Ranma marries me!  What does it matter that I'm in love with you, Ranko! What does it matter that  I was understanding, supportive and patient in ways that Ryouga and Akane could  NEVER be!"</p><p>No one dared to speak in the pause  this time, as Ukyo heaved for breath. It was not just that they felt awkward  and embarrassed by this display of outraged heart break. It was not even that  they each felt guilty of every wrong that had been done to Ukyo. This explosion  had been a long time coming, and there were no excuses anyone could make this  time to pacify Ukyo.</p><p>"What do I have to do to get  any kind of consideration, here!" The tears finally began to spill over  her cheeks. "What the hell is it that makes you so God DAMNED  insensitive!" The others continued to bite their tongues as she tried to  rein back her tears. This just provoked her more. "WELL! What the hell  are you waiting for! Answer me, GODDAMMIT!"</p><p>Strangely enough, Shampoo chose then  to speak up for the first time. "What you want Fa Shen, Ranma, Ranko say?  You want answer, but answer is what you know in heart already. Answer Shampoo  know in heart many days. Answer they no give you, 'cuz is answer you no going  to like."</p><p>Ukyo turned on Shampoo as if ready  to pounce on the amazon and rip her throat out with her teeth, "I was not  talking to you, you ignorant, air-headed twit!"</p><p>Shampoo smirked at the insult,  tempted to give her former rival the thorough beating she had longed to deliver  since Ukyo had first become an obstacle in Shampoo's quest. Instead, she drove  the point she had already aimed at Ukyo's heart home, "You too too stupid  to not understand, they can no bring selves to tell you truth. That should tell  you, truth really really going to hurt. Shampoo finally understand, she love  more and more every day, but Ranma, Ranko, Fa Shen, they no love back. Maybe  little. Like they love sister or friend."</p><p>"Shampoo," Ranko reached  out her hand to intervene, "please don't."</p><p>"No. Is necessary, Ranko. Ukyo  right, you always just leading her on. You not know how to say 'no'. Not know  how to say 'go away'…"</p><p>"I ALWAYS said 'no' and I can't  tell you how many times I asked you all to just leave me alone!" Ranma  suddenly interrupted, glaring.</p><p>"Look guys, this isn't even the  right time," Ranko tried again.</p><p>"It's never time to deal with  me, Ranko!" Ukyo accused her.</p><p>Finally, Ranko snapped. She stood up  and shouted, "Enough! Can't you see I have more problems than I can handle  right now! Do you HAVE to butt in RIGHT NOW and make things WORSE?" The  heat of an angry aura boiling off of Ranko was so unfamiliar, so disconcerting,  that everyone fell into an open mouthed silence. "Do you think all this  getting married off left and right is something I WANT to have happen! Do you  think I planned for Ranma and Ryouga to fuck! Do you think I schemed to  provoke Akane into knocking Fa Shen senseless! Do you think I agree one tiny  bit with the stupid amazon laws that say both of these marriages have taken  place!"</p><p>"Wha…?" Ukyo blinked,  feeling the edge of her anger blunted by confusion. "What the hell are you  talking about? What makes those YOUR problems, Ranko?"</p><p>"The same thing that makes  whatever happens to HIM," she pointed at her male half, "MY problem!  THEY are ME! Do you have any idea what it feels like, being chopped up into a  bunch of different pieces just so you can live up to all the things everyone else  expects from you! Here you are complaining about not getting your own piece of  me, Ukyo! Frankly, I'm surprised you haven't already grabbed him and run away.  I mean, there I am, one male type Ranko ready to go! Is that what you want,  Ukyo!"</p><p>"Ran- Ran-chan! That's not  fair…" she cried in a tiny voice.</p><p>"Of course it's not fair. Since  when did anyone care about that!" Ranko growled. "Do you think  Prince Herb would see me, all girl the way he wants, and spare any time  worrying about how unfair it would be knock me out, force me to marry him and  drag me away from everything I care about forever? Or, do you think he will see  how unfair it all is and focus his attention on how best to take advantage of  it!" Ranko marched forward and poked Ukyo in the chest, "Here's an  idea, why don't you team up with him? That way you could split the spoils of  war and both of you get what you want. Does that sound good to you?"</p><p>"H- how DARE you compare me to  HIM!" Ukyo snapped back in outrage. She slapped Ranko's hand away and  shouted back into her face, "I can't believe you think I am so cruel and  selfish!"</p><p>Ranko pretended to look shocked,  "You mean, that wasn't you all those times, teaming up with Ryouga to  break up me and Akane? You mean you haven't tried to exploit every opportunity  you could to try and force me into choosing you, damn anyone else's  honor?"</p><p>Ukyo flinched back, speechless.</p><p>"I may have forgiven everyone  for all the stupid crap they pulled, but did you really think I ever  forgot?" Ranko demanded, finally allowing a trace of the hurt and  frustration she still felt from all that constant abuse to show through.  Sagging she tried to put a comforting hand out to her friend, "I know you  love me, Ukyo. That really means something to me, and I really do love you  back. Stop obsessing over 'how much' and 'what way'. Stop trying to back me  into a corner and tie me up with commitments. I've had more of that than I can  stand, and all any of that does is give me more reason to fight back. I've had  it with people who care only about what I can do for them. I'm having a hard  enough time taking care of myself."</p><p>On the sidelines, Shampoo nodded and  smiled to herself. She had been correct after all. Things had reached the point  where the best thing she could have done to win the triplets' love was to step  aside. It was kind of a pity the same lesson was spelled out for her rival, but  then, if people started dropping out of the race now things would be much less  interesting.</p><p>"Listen, Ukyo," Ranko  relented, disturbed at the way the okonomiyaki chef was withdrawing and closing  up on herself. "I never wanted any of this marriage crap to begin with.  All it ever did was get in the way and cause problems. Right now, all I want to  do is put an end to it all and try and sort out the mess my life has become. I  can tell you, Ranma and Fa Shen don't want to be married right now any more  than I do. I had hoped bein' amazons would get Cologne and Shampoo and Mousse  off my back, but the stupid laws just make everything more complicated and I  don't get any say in what happens. None of us do."</p><p>"Forget it, Ranko. I just don't  care anymore," Ukyo turned her back.</p><p>"No. I won't just forget it.  And I'm not just going to accept it. That's the real reason I brought everyone  out here," Ranko declared firmly, taking a solid, stubborn stance. A few  eyes widened, and even Ukyo had to turn and look at her in curiosity. Ranko was  staring off into the distance, and nodded to herself. "It's time I  reminded everyone here why Ranko Saotome never loses. No matter how often you  beat me down, I am NEVER defeated!"</p><p>There was a pause, as Ryouga, Akane  and Shampoo exchanged glances and Ranma, Fa Shen and Otoko-Ranko took on  determined expressions. Shampoo slapped her fist into her palm and uttered in  mild surprise, "Shampoo never think of that. Law say, if amazon womans  'defeated' by outsider… That not same as just 'beaten'. It good argument, is  saying mans must try hump over womans spirit. "</p><p>"The word is 'triumph',"  Fa Shen muttered to Shampoo.</p><p>"That what Shampoo say,"  she retorted primly.</p><p>Ukyo pushed aside her hurt feelings  and frowned. "Isn't it a little late to debate terms, Ran-chan? How can  you possible make this fly?" she demanded, feeling faintly hopeful in  spite of herself.</p><p>"I'll figure out a way,  somehow. I am NOT gonna let Herb have his way with me. I'd rather die,"  Ranko swore.</p><p>There was a moment where everyone  stared at her in growing admiration, before Otoko-Ranko spoke up. "Uh, we  do have one little problem."</p><p>Onna-Ranko looked at him in  irritation, "Now what?"</p><p>"Well, if we stay split, we  can't fight with ki techniques and if we merge back together the twins curse  could get mixed in with a ki attack and make things even worse," he  pointed out unhappily.</p><p>"Oh. Yeah. It would be bad if  we split Herb in two. At the very least he'd double team me, and at worst, his  girl half would try and kill me for 'stripping away' her guy half,"  Onna-Ranko cringed. She cursed under her breath. She tried to decide which she  preferred, being stuck in her split state or facing both Prince and Princess  Herb. She looked at her mirror-twins. "If I accept the consequences of the  match, do you think it would matter if I had you guys stand in for me? I mean,  technically you're both still me. I've seen both of you shift into my  personality," she pointed out suggestively.</p><p>Fa Shen nodded to herself  thoughtfully. "I don't see why not. The laws are kind of vague on this  point. Read one way, Ranma and I would be barred from interfering, but you  could argue just as easily that the specific body doesn't matter in our case. I  mean, the only thing different between me and Ranko-kun here is that I'm trying  to function as a different person and he's not. If I wanted, it would be easy  to make it so no one could tell I wasn't you," she assured her twin,  giving Ranma a look that said she was just as capable.</p><p>"Well, as long as you're at  risk, I guess it'd be a good idea to trade places. We can do that now, in case  Herb is waiting to fight you as soon as we get back," Ranma suggested,  shifting from female to male form. He smiled, realizing that mastering their  curses also gave Fa Shen and himself a hidden advantage, while guaranteeing  that nothing Herb did could expose their ruse.</p><p>"It's important that we stay in  the right personalities. I think Cinnamon is capable of reading us well enough  to identify us by that alone," Ranko warned, reaching up to strip her top  off and begin the identity swap. Predictably, Ryouga almost fainted, Akane  almost brained her, and Shampoo and Ukyo looked on appreciatively as their  favorite people in the world put on an impromptu strip tease. No one really  commented on the fact that Ranko's declaration against submitting to the amazon  marriage laws, by direct implication scheming to get Ranma and Fa Shen off the  hook as well, eased the tensions that had sprung up in all of them and united  them in the task of frustrating Herb.</p><p>In the  initial bustle of inter-tribal politics, the absence of the Saotome teens went  unnoticed. That was partly forgivable, the intricacies of diplomacy took  precedence over the interests and concerns of individuals. The formalities even  obscured the stunned reaction Cinnamon had when Nodoka arrived in her  children's wake, allowing the dragon to regain her composure and begin to contemplate  exactly what she would say about Nodoka to Spice. She had been caught totally  off guard by the flavor of Nodoka's presence, much as she had been by that of  the "two-and-two-halves" triplets. Perhaps more so, since the claims  that Spice had made had prepared her for the possibility of recognizing the  resurrected Fa Shen. The last time she had been this surprised was when her  crypt was visited unexpectedly about forty years ago. Admittedly, the visitor  had been someone she had recognized instantly, having raised the girl as her  own daughter once upon a time, and whom she had trained to communicate using  her ki. A cautious and surreptitious examination of Nodoka revealed that her  adopted daughter had failed in her stated mission. Ironically, that failure  created an opportunity for a new beginning.</p><p>Cinnamon kept her optimism to  herself, sorting through the few stories she had been told on the way to this  meeting and working out unknown and undisclosed details to determine what truly  happened two generations earlier. There was also time for her to consider what  she would say, and to whom, regarding Nodoka's true identity and nature. Soon  enough, the Musk party had been brought to the Council Hall and Nodoka was  officially introduced to Cinnamon.</p><p>Once Nodoka was clear on the purpose  for Cinnamon's visit, the dragon made a request, "The examination I must  perform needs to be conducted in private, and given the factors involved, may  take some time. Is there a secure structure, well shielded from psychic or  spiritual emanations, where we may temporarily reside?"</p><p>Cologne considered the request  carefully. Clearly, the archival vault was the most ideal location, but there  was no chance in hell a dragon allied with the Musk would ever be granted  entrance there. The weapon's vault near her manor was also well shielded, and  could be temporarily cleared of tools and weapons stored there for immediate  need. "Such a place can be prepared for you in a short time," she  announced, offering a brief description of the vault and its features.</p><p>"That will be sufficient. Once  I begin, I would ask not to be interrupted and that this woman and I be  attended only by her children. That should reduce the risk of aura  contamination," Cinnamon nodded regally and turned her attention to  Nodoka. "I apologize for the inconvenience, but you will need to purify  yourself before we begin."</p><p>"It is no inconvenience,"  Nodoka bowed, offering her serene smile. Around them the elders and observers  were beginning to file out of the meeting hall. "I am as eager to know if  there is a relation between us as Emperor Spice."</p><p>Cinnamon returned the bow and turned  to the elder Po Shen, who had lingered with a look of suspicion on her  shriveled face. "I can see you are curious why I insist on these precautions,"  she commented.</p><p>"Indeed. I would think it  should be obvious to you at a glance if she is a dragon descendant. Don't you  think that would be sufficient to establish a relationship between her and  Spice?" Po Shen challenged a touch grumpily.</p><p>Cinnamon laughed softly,  "Perhaps, if you believe the imperial line of the Musk to be the only  humans descended from dragons. Also, there is the interference of the curse and  its legacy to consider. She reeks of the essence of Fa Shen, making it almost  impossible to detect any other influence."</p><p>Po Shen nodded hesitantly, "I  suppose you are right. According to legend, it took generations for the  offspring of cursed mothers to lose the imprint of Fa Shen. It makes me wish we  knew what sort of creature Pa Shen was before the Musk cursed her."</p><p>Cinnamon smirked to herself. The  Musk knew the answer to that question, and yet the amazons still remained  ignorant. How amusing that the secret had been kept for so long. "One has  to wonder why Pa Shen never chose to reveal the truth about her origins,  no?" she taunted the tiny elder.</p><p>Po Shen shrugged, "It seems  pretty obvious that she was a dragon of some kind. What else could have  sufficed to found a new dynasty of Musk? Why else would a dragon prince like  Ergot prefer her offspring over all other potential mates?"</p><p>Cinnamon shrugged, "It seems so  obvious."</p><p>"Exactly," the elder  nodded conclusively, before excusing herself.</p><p>Nodoka blinked, and seeing that the  tribal master of the arcane was the last person to depart, she turned to  Cinnamon and smiled, "I beg your pardon, but it seems to me you did not  agree with the honored elder."</p><p>Cinnamon turned to look at Nodoka.  "Oh?"</p><p>Nodoka studied the dragon. She  strongly reminded Nodoka of herself at the age she had Ranma, even down to the  arched eyebrow and coy smile. In the dragon's case, she seemed only pregnant  with mischief. "In fact, I would suspect you do not wonder about Pa Shen's  origins at all. I think you know exactly what she was, and find it amusing that  no one else does," Nodoka offered, growing bolder as the other woman's  smile grew longer.</p><p>"I have all kinds of secrets,  so there is no guessing at what amuses me. Still, I admire you for picking that  up," Cinnamon deflected Nodoka's probes gently. Seeing the stubborn line  of Nodoka's lips become set, the dragon woman laughed. "Should I take it,  then, that you wish to know what Pa Shen was?"</p><p>"Who is not curious about their  own ancestry? How can one properly honor one's forebears if one is ignorant?  This legend of Pa Shen, it is like discovering one is descended from the kami.  However, as marvelous as that sounds, I can assure you there are kami I might  prefer not to be descended from. It is all relative, you see," Nodoka  pointed out imperiously.</p><p>Cinnamon laughed again, "Be at  peace, Nodoka. I simply wished to confirm my suspicion that you have been kept  in the dark about your heritage. You compare it to being descended from the  kami, but it is clear you have no idea at all what you are speaking of. There  is no shame in that. I was ignorant once myself. Let me tell you how I was  cured of my ignorance."</p><p>Nodoka inclined her head in an  informal bow of appreciation.</p><p>Cinnamon smiled and directed Nodoka  to a bench where they settled facing each other. Catching Nodoka's eyes with  her own, the dragon called upon her heritage to project her voice directly into  the matron's mind, ensuring no one could eavesdrop on what she was about to  reveal. "This story begins a couple of years after I was cursed in the  image of Fa Shen," she began, laughing aloud as Nodoka gave a start at  hearing these words in her head.</p><p>"In spite of being an  intelligent being, it took me about that long to adapt to being human, during  which time I had but one real companion. On the day I speak of, I learned the  truth about Lo Shen, along with the fate and identity of Fa Shen. I had  assumed, since I had yet to learn the true workings of Jusenkyo, that Lo Shen  was the same girl with whom I had been fascinated in my natural form. For this  reason, even though she had been the bait with which I had been trapped in  human form, I took some pleasure in her company and my new resemblance to her.  Because she too seemed to be a captive to the men who sought to conquer us, we  were allies from the very start. She was the one who taught me to communicate  in human speech and advised me in the ways of the Musk. Lo Shen was my first,  and at the time only, friend. Both of us were imprisoned in, what I can now  perceive as, palatial splendor. Our personal nemesis was Prince Ergot. It was  through the prince's attempts to conquer us that I came to understand my  attraction to Fa Shen, to understand that my obsession was driven by a desire  to mate with her-because Ergot was driven in the same way."</p><p>"Mate with her? But surely…"  Nodoka blushed, trying to imagine something so absurd as a dragon lusting after  a human woman.</p><p>Cinnamon blushed too. "It  sounds strange from a human perspective, but among dragons attractiveness is  more of a spiritual and mental quality than a physical one. I assure you, I am  neither the first nor the last dragon to become infatuated with a maiden. Alas,  the confusion this attraction causes is responsible for certain dragons  developing a taste for woman-flesh."</p><p>"Oh dear," Nodoka stared  wide eyed, suddenly recalling the trend in dragon legends to that effect.</p><p>Cinnamon shrugged and returned to  her tale, "Our stubborn resistance had finally provoked Ergot into a rage,  in which he ranted at length about the frustrations he had endured in his  pursuit of Fa Shen." Cinnamon frowned uncomfortably, looking away to  conceal a flash of pain. "It was an unpleasant history, which I see no  need to repeat here. All that matters is that Lo Shen was revealed to me as the  brother of Fa Shen. I had witnessed several of his battles with his sister in  the past, when I noted that he too had a mesmerizing, attractive quality. This  magnetism, whatever it was, was not as strong in the boy as it had been in the  girl, so I had never pursued him. I should have known it was as possible for  that boy to be transformed into the girl I had befriended as it was for me to  have been similarly transfigured. In fact, Lo Shen had been the one who tried  to explain my transformation to me, but my grasp of the language was  insufficient to comprehend the concept of a nyanniichuan curse that was locked  by the chisuiiton.</p><p>"On that day, it hit me like a  lightning bolt.</p><p>"I instantly understood that Lo  Shen was cursed as I was, and I felt deceived, betrayed, even though my  ignorance and misunderstanding was to blame. I also felt alarm. Afraid of the  answer I would receive, I interrupted them to ask about the origin of our  curses-more specifically, I asked about Fa Shen's fate. Ergot took perverse  pleasure in describing her death to me, and the plot that had led to my  capture. I hated Ergot already, but I was not prepared to learn of my  'friend's' role in this tragedy. I vowed to kill Ergot, and I promised Lo Shen  that I would punish her for assisting in "his" sister's murder."</p><p>Cinnamon paused here for some time,  sorting out her thoughts.</p><p>"It took me some time to design  and execute my revenge," she picked up, prompted to resume her tale when  Nodoka shifted in her seat. Once again, she elected to skip over the gory  details. "Ergot I simply killed. When the opportunity presented itself, I  slaughtered him as coldly and cruelly as he murdered Fa Shen. Lo Shen, however,  was still the closest thing I had to a friend. At times, I thought the betrayal  she had suffered at Ergot's hands was sufficient punishment for the betrayal of  Fa Shen. Karmic justice. Ultimately, I could not forgive the whole of the  story. Fa Shen's death was the last betrayal, but Lo Shen had tried endlessly  to deliver her into Ergot's bed. I decided Lo Shen should suffer the fate he  had intended for Fa Shen. It was ridiculously easy to accomplish. I seduced a  man and brought him to a room where I had left Lo Shen drugged and naked in  bed."</p><p>Nodoka tried to conceal her  reaction. Even knowing the justification for this punishment, and recognizing  the poetry irony that shaped it, it also touched on her deepest fear concerning  her children and their cursed condition.</p><p>"You must think it too cruel,  that I would do such a thing to my only friend, in spite of her crimes,"  Cinnamon gazed steadily into Nodoka's eyes.</p><p>Nodoka shook her head, wincing,  "It is not my place to judge. Honor often demands far greater sacrifice  than an eye for an eye. Only Fa Shen can say if you went too far to avenge her  honor and death."</p><p>Cinnamon nodded slowly, "It still  is disconcerting to realize I actually could ask her." Dismissing that,  she shrugged and pointed out, "I did not intend for Lo Shen to become  pregnant, however and neither of us was properly prepared to deal with  childbirth. The women of the Musk refused to aid or attend Lo Shen, because of  her past. Their indifference and our ignorance killed her. She exhausted  herself in labor and she begged me to split her open if that was what it took  to save the baby." Again, the memories of the past filled her with agony,  forcing her to fall silent. Nodoka waited patiently as she regained her  composure and continued. "I considered her death a punishment for my own  arrogance, and truly I had damned myself. You see, Pa Shen had taken advantage  of the fact that a whole generation of Musk brides were created in her  daughter's image to infiltrate the stronghold and free Lo Shen. If she had been  just a day earlier, she might have saved Lo Shen's life. Instead she arrived  after Lo Shen's father had taken her child and left the Musk, leaving me to  attend to her remains.</p><p>"Pa Shen begged me to tell her  everything I could about her son-turned-daughter. In exchange, I had her tell  me about Fa Shen. We mourned together, but I foolishly confessed what I had  done to Lo Shen, and she became enraged. She accused me of being just like  every other dragon, and we fought. Or rather, I tried to defend myself from her  wrath, and I think I only survived that night because Pa Shen could not bring  herself to kill someone who wore her daughter's face.</p><p>"Pa Shen left as suddenly as  she arrived. After licking my wounds, I returned to light the pyre that she and  I had built for Lo Shen as we mourned together, wondering about Pa Shen's  accusation. She had disparaged me for being a dragon in the way I had heard  numerous women disparage men. I reflected on how the mother had struck me as  possessing that same, incredible attractiveness as her children-yet which  Ergot never had. If anything, Ergot had been somewhat repulsive. Even if I had  loved him, it would have been difficult to embrace him with any sort of passion  or trust. I imagine sex would have been incredible with him, but that kind of  arousal paled in comparison to my reaction to Pa Shen and her offspring. It was  like they were a drug, an aphrodisiac.</p><p>"I stared into the flames of my  friend's cremation, straining my brain for an answer to the mystery. I found it  as I sifted through the ashes the next morning." Yet again, there was a  long pause as Cinnamon stared into Nodoka's eyes, searching for the glimmer of  understanding. It took a moment, but Nodoka eventually tilted her head in faint  suspicion and prompted her to explain what she was implying.</p><p>Cinnamon took a deep breath, though  this mattered little in the projection of her mental voice, and smiled  conspiratorially. "I mistook it for a large, smooth stone at first. Then  it wobbled, and I all but hit myself over the head. I was a dragon once, after  all. You would think I would recognize an egg instantly," she laughed  aloud as Nodoka's eyes widened wonderingly. "I blame grief for my addled  brains, because the next thing I did was wonder aloud what sort of creature  lays its eggs in a fire. So, you can imagine my surprise when the shell cracked  at my touch and revealed a baby girl."</p><p>"You can't possible be  serious!" Nodoka finally cracked.</p><p>"I am perfectly serious,  Nodoka," Cinnamon smirked, her expression changing to something a bit more  motherly as she sighed, "That infant girl born from the ashes of my  friend's death was the shock of my life. The answer to a question I barely knew  to ask. I adopted her on the spot, naming her for my departed friend, and  raised her as my daughter."</p><p>"You mean that this little girl  was actually Lo Shen," Nodoka pressed.</p><p>"Because her mother, or his  mother, if you want to be specific, was originally a phoenix. Yes,"  Cinnamon finally spelled it out. "I did not reveal the truth to anyone  else, however. Lo Shen's father had taken her son away, back to the mountain  where Pa Shen had been captured in the wild. There was no reason for anyone to  think I had not been pregnant myself. Neither I, nor my 'daughter' were of much  interest to anyone important. No one was crazy enough to disturb me after  Ergot's death. At least not immediately. When my daughter came of age to  attract the attention of Musk men, I liberated the kaisuifuu to unlock the  curse she inherited and we fled from the Musk. When she left to track down her  real mother, Pa Shen, I thought I would never see her again. The closest I ever  came was when she returned forty years ago to ask my advice."</p><p>Nodoka nodded, in the manner of one  listening while thinking things over. Then she started and stared at Cinnamon.  "No. Forty years ago! You can't mean…"</p><p>"That Kenshin was not lying  when she identified herself as Lo Shen," Cinnamon nodded. "Spice told  me the story. It took me a while to realize he was talking about my adopted  daughter. I had been wondering how I could have missed the presence of this  Kenshin, since I'd been roused near the same time by Lo Shen."</p><p>"My word," Nodoka put a  hand to her throat and swallowed her surprise.</p>
