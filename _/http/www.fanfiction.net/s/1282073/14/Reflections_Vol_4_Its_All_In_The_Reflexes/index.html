</div>It's All In The Reflexes<p>A  Reflections Bonus Volume</p><p>A. V.  Morgan</p><p>Author's  Note</p><p>I'd like  to apologize for the delay in releasing this chapter. December turned into an  insane month for me, with a mortgage check bouncing, the bank foreclosing on  the house, suddenly having to find a new place to live, pack, move and at the  same time deal with increased hours at work and the holidays. Thus, what should  have been a day's delay to complete a mere 1,000 words and a bit of proofing to  do between posting the previous part and this one turned into a month  of struggling to squeeze in a sentence here and there in my spare time.  Fortunately, the holidays are over, the move is in the final settling-in phase,  and I have a laptop on loan to allow me to work in whatever space I can find.  Hopefully, this means the wait for the final part of Reflexes will be  significantly less. Once again, I'd like to thank my readers for their patience  and persistence. Happy New Year!</p><p>A.V.  Morgan</p><p>Part  Fourteen</p><p>When  Cinnamon and Nodoka entered the vault next to the  Matriarch's Manor, both the Musk and the amazons had placed an honor guard at  the door to ensure there were no interruptions or interference by members of  either tribe. Fa Shen had  been permitted entrance by Cinnamon's specific instructions, but when she and  Cinnamon both emerged, with Nodoka, in obvious male  guise, the Musk guards had been alarmed and detached a messenger to inform  their emperor and prince. That messenger arrived at the courtyard of the  village council hall, where the Musk contingent had been settled to await the  results of Cinnamon's examination of Nodoka, and was  instantly escorted before Spice and Herb. The pair were busy discussing  arrangements for a lunch banquet to feed the large contingent of Musk with a  couple of amazon elders. They hastily wrapped up that  negotiation and then turned their attention to the soldier's report. Spice and  Herb fought to contain their displeasure at what the man revealed, demanding an  explanation for Cinnamon's transformation.</p><p>"My Lord Emperor, it was  discovered, after the three left, that there had been casks of Nanniichuan water stored in the vault. The other guards and  I distinctly heard some kind of commotion just before the dragon and the  amazons emerged from within. One cask was shattered, and the dragon, Cinnamon,  was the only one soaked when they came out."</p><p>"I see. Did they offer any  explanation?" Spice inquired.</p><p>"Not as such. We did overhear  the woman instructing her child to prepare a bath for the dragon as they  departed for the manor."</p><p>"I would assume there was an  accident then," Spice mused aloud, picturing the chaos that would have  occurred if the dragon had been cursed deliberately or in malice. For that  matter, there was no logical reason for the amazons to inflict such a curse on  a woman, even if that woman was previously inhuman. In fact, it was hard to  believe the amazons would keep a store of nanniichuan  water on hand at all. Unfortunately, it was obvious now that they had, and it  was logical that it would be kept in a vault, and perhaps those who had cleared  out the vault for the dragon's use had not recognized the casks for the danger  they were.</p><p>"It still seems suspicious, Father,"  Herb glowered. In the wake of Ranko's departure,  after denouncing Herb's challenge on the grounds of sabotage, Spice had taken  Herb aside to explain the situation he had forced them into. In the event that Ranko could not be claimed for Herb's bride, the only  remaining candidate would be Cinnamon. Not that either felt enthusiastic about  Herb's chances with the dragon. However, Ranko had  been made well aware of the criteria of Spice's command. It was possible Ranko or her siblings would have concluded that Cinnamon  was a bridal candidate and taken steps to frustrate Herb out of spite.</p><p>"This makes Cinnamon an  unacceptable candidate," Spice noted aloud, clearly thinking along the  same lines as his son. Strangely, he sounded more relieved than outraged.  Turning to Herb, he pulled himself to his full height and declared,  imperiously, "Ranko is now your only option,  Son."</p><p>Herb stared back at him, straining  to keep his face composed. Since that had hardly needed to be said, what his  father really meant was that Herb needed to act at once. That meant making good  on his threat to conquer Ranko without a formal  challenge. For the fight itself, it made no difference, but politically it  might prove disastrous. Without the protection of a formal challenge, a fight  with Ranko could precipitate a war with the amazon tribe. This would not be good for the Musk. The Musk  remained a formidable power, but there were very few true, traditional Musk  remaining. The modern Musk Empire was more of a financial or industrial empire,  its warriors chosen and trained in the traditional ways from birth, but  sufficient in number only to form the core of an elite strike force and provide  the emperor and prince with their personal guards. The rest of the Musk were  more of a cult or secret society than a brotherhood of warriors, composed of  men who traced their ancestry to the empire, but who had been born scattered  throughout Asia.</p><p>"You realize what that  means?" Herb asked softly.</p><p>Spice maintained a stony reserve,  allowing his eyes to sweep over the bulk of the Musk army. If he called upon  the elite guard, he might be able to double his current forces. But, the  amazons could not know that was the limit of the Musk's combat capability.  "These women are no more eager for war than I, my Son. I think the threat  of open war might be enough to force them to encourage Ranko  to meet you in formal combat. I do not doubt that she may be willing to kill by  this stage in your affairs, but I sincerely doubt she can stomach the thought  of others dying for her."</p><p>Herb considered that for a moment  before nodding. "Very well then. That leaves only the outsiders. They  proved this morning, again, that they will intervene on Ranko's  behalf, either out of loyalty to her or to protect their own interests. How do  you recommend they be dealt with?"</p><p>Spice gave his son an evil smile,  "That is an interesting point. On one hand, it would hurt your bid to tame  Ranko if you were forced to eliminate her friends,  but at the same time she would be far easier to control if she were stripped of  all of her allies before submitting to you. Naturally, it would be  'unfortunate' if these people were slain or injured accidentally as a result of  interfering in the battle. Ranko would certainly be  distraught, but who could really blame you for the folly of others, and it is a  given that girl will be difficult to manage under any circumstances. When you  'claim a bride from the wild', you have no choice but to break her to your  will. Eventually, you will be able to mold her into a suitable mate."</p><p>Herb snorted. The challenge of  breaking someone as spirited and impertinent as Ranko  or her siblings was exciting to contemplate, but the fact remained, he did not  particularly desire her for a mate. Also, it seemed wrong somehow to crush Ranko so ruthlessly, when he still owed her a debt for  saving his life at Horiisan. It was somehow tragic,  yet his loyalty to his father was unquestionable. He resolved to defeat her  utterly, but nevermore to hurt or humiliate her once he fulfilled his father's  wishes. Somehow, he would make her happy, make up for this seeming treachery. He  just needed to make her understand they BOTH would be forced to try and make  the best of a difficult situation. Not that that would be easy if he followed  his father's advice.</p><p>"So, you suggest I simply kill  her friends if they interfere?" Herb surmised, focusing on the problem of Ranko's allies.</p><p>"I suggest you reissue your  challenge and demand resolution on the spot. We can bluff the amazons into  conceding to a formal challenge, and if so, you are within your rights to  dispatch anyone who interferes. Point out to them that they can expect no mercy  if they dare. They are not amazons, so striking them down will not incur the  wrath of the Joketsuzoku. The amazons, in turn, would  not risk going to war over the deaths of outsiders, if they will not risk it  for Ranko's sake," Spice counseled.</p><p>Herb shrugged and proceeded to  summon his personal guard. "Then I shall go and confront her now. I can  state my conditions before Ranko, and the Matriarch  herself, at the same time."</p><p>"Very well. I will speak to the  Council of Elders."</p><p>Father and son parted ways, one  entering the village hall behind him, the other marching directly to the  Matriarch's Manor. As he turned onto the path to Cologne's  home, he looked up in surprise. Raw chi seemed to be flooding outward from the  building ahead of Herb. It was a kind of energy that crawled along his flesh  and awakened a hunger he rarely acknowledged in himself. Blinking in confusion,  he increased his pace, curious about what was causing this display of power. He  stopped short about twenty meters from the house when a group of people crashed  through an upper-story window and dove for the ground. While Herb quirked an  eyebrow-frowning, as the presence of two naked girls suggested the exodus was  in dire haste-a heart stopping detonation of chi ripped away the roof of the  dormitory wing of the manor.</p><p>"What the-!" the prince  gasped, before the concussion wave hit.</p><p>Caught totally off guard, Herb could  only pray that this was not some kind of ambush. Blinded, deafened, and stung  numb from being blown off his feet and smacked into the wall surrounding the  front courtyard, Herb wasted several long, precious moments recovering his  wits. Moments an assassin would not have permitted him. As his vision cleared,  he scanned the area, and noticed that he was not the only one picking  themselves up and dusting themselves off. Some of the girls who threw  themselves out the window ahead of the blast had been caught in mid fall by the  shock wave and blown through the upper sections of the courtyard wall.  Fortunately, they had been hit only by displaced air and not the chi propelled  debris of the house. That would have been akin to taking a shotgun blast at close  range, considering the fact that the upper half of the dormitory wing appeared  to have disintegrated in the explosion.</p><p>The only person who seemed to have  suffered no damage or discomfort was Cinnamon, standing naked and proud where  she had landed beneath the recently shattered-now obliterated-window. The  other naked girl, and the girl who typically disguised herself as a boy, were  each cradled in one of Cinnamon's arms. The dragon had erected some form of chi  shield to protect herself and her passengers, and was probably the only person  who clearly witnessed the explosion.</p><p>Before Herb could confront her, the  dragon dropped her passengers and leapt back up to the now devastated  collection of guest bedrooms. Dusting himself off, Herb launched himself after  her, tracking her to what would have been the bedroom across the hall from the  one the dragon escaped through. Herb's demand for an explanation died  stillborn, as he saw Cinnamon kneel beside a younger, but equally naked,  red-headed girl. The dragon's words carried back to him in the eerie silence  that followed the disruption.</p><p>"Uh, where's… um… the rest of  you?"</p><p>The Saotome  girl did not respond for a moment, seeming to be staring off in shock.  Gradually, she noticed the older girl's presence and started. "What have I  done!" she suddenly cried out, jumping to her feet.</p><p>"From the glimpse I got, I'd  say you blew off a bit more than just steam, girl," Cinnamon joked, trying  to calm her. "Um, I don't suppose you saw where the others got blown off  to?"</p><p>The girl seemed to jerk in pain,  then sagged. "I… it… we… There's just me," she spoke softly. "I…  I killed Ranma and Fa Shen!" Ranko collapsed to  her knees and gasped. Tears and agony would not come, however. Ranko was caught in the numbing grip of shock. Even as she  accused herself, an inner voice reminded her she WAS Ranma  and Fa Shen. That's what  being Ranko meant. But the guilt remained. By  absorbing her reflections, there was no longer the possibility of sustaining  either identity independent of herself. "Why did they do that? NO! Why did  *I* do that!" she demanded, correcting herself at once as she recalled  why her reflections assumed her perspective to deal with the power of the  circuit. But the answers to these questions would not come, as she knelt looking  up at the dragon. Ranko cursed her self for not  realizing Ranma and Fa Shen would be affected by the reversal curse. If she had  not put their bodies into physical contact with her split bodies, they could  not have been forced to merge with her when the chi curse imprinted them.</p><p>"Do what?" Herb finally  interrupted, having approached unnoticed by the two girls. "What did you  do, Ranko?" It was convenient of the girl to  identify herself, even if the statement she made roused some alarming questions.  "What do you mean, you killed Ranma and Fa Shen?"</p><p>Ranko  stiffened, whipping around to stare at Herb. Instinctively she leapt to her  feet and brought up her guard as she spun around. Surprise melted into instant  rage and she spat out, "What are you doing here!" It was just  perfect. He WOULD show up the instant she was weakened. The instant she lost  the two most important people in her life, through her own ignorance and Herb's  interference. She growled and narrowed her eyes dangerously, accusing, "Actually,  if it wasn't for you, this never would have happened!"</p><p>Herb was nonplussed. "I don't  suppose you plan to answer my question, but I can easily answer yours. It is  time for you to honor my challenge, and if your friends and the lives of the  amazons mean anything to you, you will answer it honorably," Herb  declared.</p><p>Cinnamon glared at the prince,  stepping close to Ranko and placing a comforting and  restraining hand on her shoulder. "Is this honorable, Prince Herb?  Confronting her now, in the wake of an obvious disaster, when she is naked and  in shock?" the dragon challenged acidly.</p><p>"Considering the amount of  power she just displayed? The power that clings to her still?" Herb  retorted, having taken the opportunity to gauge Ranko's  ki and chi reserves. "I believe she is capable  of fighting, noble dragon. Also, one would think that I was putting myself at a  disadvantage, fighting her with all of her assets on display…"</p><p>"You don't possess that  weakness anymore, remember?" Cinnamon snorted, faintly insulted that he  would claim a weakness he had bragged to her, just that morning, about  overcoming.</p><p>Herb waved her accusation off.  "It matters little. As longs as she agrees to the challenge, I have no  issue with allowing her to dress and collect herself before the battle. Now,  why are you acting as her advocate?"</p><p>"Simple, once she has defeated  you, I plan to make my own suit," the dragon admitted.</p><p>Ranko  gasped, eyes snapping open wide, and jerked away from the taller girl.  "What do you mean? What did I ever do to you!" she cried.  Unfortunately, Ranko had gained the memory of  Cinnamon's revelation to Fa Shen,  and combined with the memories of her childhood as Fa  Shen, it was not hard to see why the dragon would  take advantage of its new curse to claim the object of its fifteen-hundred-year  obsession. "That's the final straw! I'm not putting up with this any  more!" she shouted, twisting her head about to scan the debris of her  room. Spotting her pack in a pile of wreckage where the closet had been, Ranko darted towards it.</p><p>Before Herb or Cinnamon could react,  Ranko had snagged her travel pack and launched  herself high into the air, rocketing away from the village. The two blinked in  surprise and then turned to each other.</p><p>"That was one hell of a  jump…" Herb remarked.</p><p>"Jump, hell…! I think she's  flying!" Cinnamon gasped, stunned to witness such power an unconscious  skill in one so young.</p><p>"Flying? At that speed? She'll  burn herself out…" the prince argued.</p><p>"You question her power, dragonling? Look around you!" Cinnamon gestured  broadly, a look of excitement and longing flickering over her features. She  could see the prince unconsciously fighting the arousal caused by standing in  the wash of Ranko's power. "I don't think she  even realizes how much raw chi she's generating. She had to have pulled most of  the energy of that explosion back into herself, or I doubt the village would  still be here," Cinnamon frowned, resisting the urge to pursue Ranko-at least long enough to return to the bath and  dress. It was highly unlikely that Ranko would burn  off all this excess energy even to power something as extravagant as flight, so  Cinnamon was confident she would be able to track her down later easily enough.  Considering how negatively Ranko had reacted to  Cinnamon's intention to pursue her, it might not be a bad idea to let her have  some time alone.</p><p>Herb, however, chose not to exercise  patience. "Her power is truly impressive, but I doubt she is able to use  it efficiently. She will certainly be careless and clumsy in the use of this  much power. She can't know her present limits, and I can use that to my  advantage." He launched himself into the air after Ranko,  ignoring the dragon and her ridiculous assertion. He had no intention of losing  his fight with Ranko. The dragon was an idiot to  permit Herb the chance to stake his claim first.</p><p>Cinnamon sighed as he flew off in  pursuit. "Foolish boy," she muttered. Levitating a few feet over the  remains of the upper story, she shifted into her native form, instantly  dwarfing the manor and sparking cries of terror throughout the village. With  the keen senses of a dragon, Cinnamon conducted a quick search of the area. It  took only fifteen minutes to cover the entire village in an outward spiral  search, and determine that there were no bodies to support Ranko's  claim of having killed Ranma and Fa  Shen. It was as if they had both ceased to exist.  Returning to the manor and reverting to female, human form, she entered the  building to collect her clothes and ponder the mystery of what had really  happened.</p><p>Emerging fully dressed from the  bath, she confronted Cologne, Nodoka and the teenagers in the front yard. "Can  anyone here explain how three of the Fa Shen incarnations could simply vanish in Ranko's blast?" she demanded.</p><p>This prompted a quick summation of  the manner in which Ranma and Fa  Shen had been split off from Ranko,  and how Ranko was twinned. Ukyo volunteered a quick  explanation of Ranko's plan to restore herself to her  untwined state, and Cologne  deduced, after getting a description of the last moments in Ranko's  room before the explosion, that the chi blast had been infected with the shed, chuanshontsuniichuan reversal curse-guessing that the  magic treated Ranma and Fa Shen as additional byproducts of the salted curse.</p><p>"All that would matter, I  suppose, was that all four of them were divided by similar magic from a single  source," Cologne concluded  amidst stunned and horrified gasps from Akane, Ryouga and Ukyo.</p><p>"What about Ranma?"  Ryouga cried desperately.</p><p>"What about Fa  Shen?" Akane echoed  anxiously.</p><p>"Why would Ranko  think she killed Ranma and Fa  Shen, if they all just merged together?"  Cinnamon puzzled, while sorting through all the details provided to explain the  situation. For someone who had lived for so long with a Jusenkyo  curse, it was startling to discover so many new things about the magic of the  accursed springs and the products created from them. "If these chi based  curses can be reversed, wouldn't it be simple enough to bring them both  back?"</p><p>Ukyo, still in temporary male form,  looked up from his own contemplation, and finally voiced the question he had  been restraining, "Where is Ranko now? Why did  she take off like that, without explaining anything?"</p><p>Cinnamon paused from her  ruminations, to say, "Oh, I forgot to mention that. Herb arrived just  after I went back up to check on her. He went on about it being time for them  to fight their marriage duel. When I told him I would be challenging her, after  she defeated him, she got upset with both of us and took off. He chased after  her and I stopped to look for her siblings."</p><p>Everyone stared at the dragon in  disbelief, shocked at the matter-of-fact way she declared her intentions toward  Ranko.</p><p>"Are you insane! You  challenged her!" Ryouga and Akane  shouted.</p><p>"Well, no. Not yet. She hasn't  defeated Herb yet," she corrected, with a dismissive wave of her hand.</p><p>"You can't challenge her!"  Ukyo cried in dismay.</p><p>"Oh? Why is that?" the  dragon looked curious.</p><p>"You… you just can't!"  Ukyo, Akane and Ryouga all  chorused.</p><p>Cologne  cleared her throat. This drew everyone's attention to her. Holding up a  cautionary hand, she offered, "Before you start fighting, I need to point  out that there are a number of things yet to be settled. Such as, finding out  if Ranma and Fa Shen can be split off from Ranko  again. If it turns out that they can not be recovered, their marriages with Ryouga and Akane would devolve  onto Ranko. It has already been established that Ranko is a blend of the two."</p><p>"What do you mean, if they can't  be recovered! Why wouldn't they be able to split up again!" Ryouga panicked. Once again, the threat of losing the one  she loved had reared its ugly head, and Ryouga could  not stand it.</p><p>Cologne  sighed. "Please, contain yourself, Ryouga. This  is a troubling development, but nothing has been tested or proven yet."</p><p>"I am curious about this  too," the dragon pointed out, referring to the question she had asked  before Ukyo interrupted.</p><p>"I suspect that Ranko fears the same thing I do," the old woman confided  edgily. Clearing her throat, she summarized what she had picked up and  concluded about the incident, "The trigger for the fusion seems to have  been the climax of passion. An orgasm naturally releases the energy built up in  sex to trigger conception. This accident has to be a result of that. The aura  they built up at the critical moment was white-gold; an aura of ecstasy and  love. That suggests that an aura of hatred and agony might be the trigger to  split Ranko again, but…" Cologne  trailed off with a sigh.</p><p>"But what?" the others  asked, clinging to every word.</p><p>"Curses of the same type  generally do not stack. If the instant curse on Ranko  reversed the effect of the Mirror of Broken Souls, the chi curse she imprinted  herself with might not have the capacity to produce the two couples it merged.  It might only split Ranko back into male and female,  or it might produce identical twins with mastered curses. Whenever possible, Jusenkyo magic simplifies things like that," Cologne  warned.</p><p>Cinnamon nodded. "I would  concur, based on my own studies."</p><p>"So… That's it? Ranma and Fa Shen  are… dead?" Akane cringed.</p><p>"No more than Ranko is. They are all one and the same, it's just a matter  of having enough of Ranko to go around." Cologne  produced her pipe and lit it. The fight between Ranko  and Herb might provide some answers. It would be a wonder if an aura of hatred  and agony did not emerge in the course of the battle certain to evolve between  those two. It served no purpose to try and prevent their contest. Now that Ranko had circumvented the prince's sabotage attempt, the  grounds for invalidating Herb's challenge had evaporated. There was nothing  left to protest. She was strong and whole, and Herb had pushed Ranko to the utter limit. Even someone as naïve and forgiving  as she was had a breaking point, and then all bets were off.</p><p>Ukyo slammed his palm on the table.  "We'll worry about this later! Right now, we have to do something about  Herb! I can't believe he'd go after her so soon, especially after something  like this!"</p><p>"I can't believe you'd think of  interfering, Ukyo," Cologne  criticized. "If what Cinnamon says is true, the poor boy doesn't have a  chance against Ranko right now. It's best to let them  get it over with once and for all."</p><p>"Hey, I'm a true believer in Ranchan! Ranma or Ranko, Ranchan never loses in a  serious fight! But hasn't everyone been saying that Herb plays for keeps? Do  you believe he wouldn't try some dirty trick or cheat in order to win? Is it  really worth the risk of him beating Ranko?" Ukyo  entreated angrily.</p><p>"Herb needs to have that  chance, or he will never let up. Until he loses this challenge, he has no other  options," Cinnamon stated coolly.</p><p>"I can't believe you, Old  Woman!" Ukyo barked at Cologne,  jumping up and turning to her friends and rivals. "Are all of you gonna sit around here and listen to this crap when Ranko needs us?"</p><p>Ryouga  stood up with grim determination. To everyone's surprise, Mirror stood barely a  second after. Shampoo and Akane exchanged looks for a  moment before standing in turn. Akane stepped forward  and stated fervently, "Suddenly, it feels like old times. Ranko may be a pervert and a jerk, but she's our perverted  jerk! More importantly, we're her friends. Let's show that arrogant prince what  it means to mess with Ranko's friends!"</p><p>Cinnamon looked from them, to Nodoka, and finally to Cologne.  "Are they always like this?"</p><p>"When they're not trying to  kill each other over her?" Cologne  smirked. Shaking her head, she turned to the teenagers, "It might not be a  bad idea to watch Ranko's back for her. Try not to  get yourselves killed in the process, and… don't let yourselves be used against  her. You simply cannot afford to underestimate Prince Herb. Ranko  is the only one of you who is truly safe in a fight with him."</p><p>It took  a while for Ranko to realize that the ground was not  getting any closer. Her emotional state was so wild and chaotic, her temper so  raw, even the passage of time barely registered. Inevitably, however, she was  forced to notice the fact that she was literally flying. When it hit her, she  was so surprised her aura flickered out for an instant causing her to begin  plummeting to earth. As her aura surged forth again, the unconscious command  she had been exerting to sustain her flight did not return with it. Voicing a  squawk of panic, Ranko crashed through the canopy of  the forest she had been hurtling over, instinctively raising a sphere of chi to  shield herself from an onslaught of branches and the jarring collision with the  ground. The sudden impact formed an oblong crater and scattered dirt and debris  throughout the clearing she came to rest in. Fortunately, her shield held,  cushioning her body and softening her landing to the point where she might have  just thrown herself down on a bed.</p><p>"Oh, man," she groaned,  shaking her head and picking herself up. Taking a look around, once she got  back to her feet, she noticed the crater she had made and blinked in amazement.  As fast as she had been going, there at the end, she had expected to become a smear  along the forest floor. She shuddered once in reaction to that image, then  turned her attention to the pack she had balled herself around at the last  moment.</p><p>Frowning, as a cool wind blew over  her skin and reminded her of her nudity, she opened the pack and pulled out a  change of clothes. While slipping into panties and a sports' halter, she  reflected on what she had just been doing. "I can't believe it! I was  actually flying!" an unbidden smile of excitement and delight spread  across her lips, as the wonder of that realization temporarily displaced the  anger and grief resulting from absorbing her other selves. Unfortunately, her  next thought was to wonder how she had accomplished the feat, and that shifted  her focus to the power now coursing through her. With a start, she realized  that the merge had not broken the circuit! She had been locked in intercourse  when the four of her fused into one.</p><p>"What the-!" she gasped.  Her feelings of guilt and shame suddenly multiplied as the notion that she had  gained the full power of the circuit at the cost of Ranma  and Fa Shen crystallized.  "Ohmygod. What have I done?" she cried out  in despair. The emotion summoned a fresh surge of power.</p><p>Ranko  squeezed her eyes shut tight, fighting to bring herself under control. Mechanically,  she continued to dress and then re-secured her pack for traveling. To  discipline her emotions, she carefully analyzed her situation and the  consequences of her fusion. Her first comment to herself about her situation  brought an ugly frown to her face. "I'm running away," she observed  with mild disgust. Facts danced in her head for a second, and she spat out,  "I may not be that lazy panda's kid in fact, but I sure seem to be his kid  in spirit!"</p><p>She growled and slipped her arms  through the pack's shoulder straps. She was not just running away from Herb and  Cinnamon, she noted miserably. She had fled from the scene of the disaster as  much to avoid the reaction of Ryouga and Akane, or Ukyo and the others, as out of frustration over  the escalating efforts of those who wanted to marry her. Everything was a mess.  Ukyo had turned herself into a man. Mousse had turned himself into a girl,  after betraying her to Herb-like Akane, infecting  himself with the ghost of an instant curse. Ryouga  was stuck as a girl and needed Ranma's  "encouragement" to regain his manhood, and Cinnamon intended to  exploit her new found manhood to join the race to win Ranko.  Everyone wanted a piece of her, and each of them had paid dearly for the  privilege, but now there was less of her to go around. That last point caused  her the most grief because, in spite of her guilt and shame, she was secretly  pleased to be all together in one piece.</p><p>"I'm happy," she slurred  miserably, fighting the onset of tears. That realization was undeniable. After  watching Ranma and Fa Shen's identity crises, and suffering another split, the  whole notion of divvying herself up to meet all the demands on her had begun to  seriously rankle. "I'm actually relieved to be whole again." It  figured, what was probably the best thing for her was the worst thing that  could have happened. As far as it concerned Ryouga  and Akane, who she loved, what she had done was  horrible. Unforgivable. At the same time, Ranko no  longer had to keep herself "one incarnation away" from either of  them. She did not have to suffer as Ranma walked away  with Ryouga, or as Akane  began to embrace her relationship with Fa Shen.</p><p>"They're gonna  hate me for this!" Ranko cried.</p><p>It also hurt to know that Ukyo, and  even Shampoo-who she had sex with as Fa Shen-were not even factored in. Knowing now what it was to  love, knowing how much those two loved her, in part or in whole, only added a  new dimension of anguish for her to struggle with. She did not return their  love, but Ranko did not honestly know if she COULD  not return their love, or if she simply could not AFFORD to return their love.  Every time she looked in their eyes, they were begging Ranko  to give them a chance to win her heart, and every time Ranko  denied them. They were her friends, but she resented their demands almost as  much as she abhorred the intentions of Herb, and now Cinnamon.</p><p>But, running away was no solution.  Even if she could not fix the mess she was in, it was damn time she did  something to keep it from growing any worse. It was already more than she could  handle, even if she still had Ranma and Fa Shen to share the load.  Unfortunately, by using them to liberate herself, Ranko  had only made her problems worse. Exploiting their presence had merely been a  different form of running away.</p><p>Ranko  tightened her fist.</p><p>Reverting to this singular state  changed everything.</p><p>For the first time, Ranko stood in a position to truly take her destiny into  her own hands. There was no need to divide her life up between different aspects  of herself. No need to distance herself from her past AS Ranma  and Fa Shen, or present  herself as a mere echo of them. No need to pretend that this was not her life  or that she could not claim her right to it. It was a good time to start  fighting back, beginning with the fight she could not have run away from no  matter how much she wanted to. Herb was certain to chase her down and try  forcing her to marry him. She was mad enough at that to really look forward to  fighting him. Ranko cringed immediately after that  thought, feeling her resolve waver even as she built it up. It was not enough  to just fight. It was not enough to win. Even if she did beat him down, those  stupid amazon laws would still remain. No matter how  often she fought and won, she would always have to endure some man trying to  force her into marriage.</p><p>"Like being married to Ryouga AND Akane isn't  enough!" she growled, accurately predicting the ruling of the council in  the case of her fusion. Which was a problem for Ryouga  and Akane as much as it was for her. Without even  begging the question of whether they could or would share her, neither of them  was any more ready for marriage than Ranko was. For  that matter, Ranko had never truly been defeated at  either of their hands. The marriages were based on misapprehension, but the  feelings that were strung between them were real. Ranko  would love to reject the former and embrace the latter, but rejecting the  marriages would just encourage people like Herb and Cinnamon-who were nothing  to her.</p><p>"I swear, it'd be simpler to  just get knocked up by some stranger, have the baby and claim matriarch  status!" she griped, turning to face back toward the village. That was the  real key to power and status among the amazons: Motherhood, and strong descendants.  Mothers were exempt from the marriage laws, having fulfilled their duty to  strengthen the tribe. The real power of the elders came from the success of  their blood lines, the proof of their progeny. Ranko  shook her head, "Man. There's got to be a better way to stop this insanity  than bring a kid into the middle of it! If I'm not ready for marriage, I  totally ain't ready to be a mom. But that's what it's  all about, isn't it? That's what Mom wants. That's what Herb and Spice want.  That's that Pop and Tendo-san want.</p><p>"It was never really about  me," Ranko spat, feeling somehow betrayed.  "All this pressure about marriage, it was always about havin'  kids, providin' heirs, buildin'  a legacy. My feelings never mattered!" Thoughts and emotions began to feed  on each other, fueling a storm surge of chi. Ranko  noticed it as the aura she was generating began to spiral around her, leaving  her behind in a sheltered eye of calm. It was a deceptive calm, one charged  with dangerous intent.</p><p>Ranko took  a deep breath and fought to compose herself again.</p><p>Once her emotions were back under  her control, she reexamined the idea. She had come close to deciding to have a  child just to spite everyone. Fortunately, she had realized the idea was  ridiculous. Just losing her virginity had cost her, cost the people she cared  for, too much. She was just fooling herself. All the protection that matriarch  status offered would not fix the mess she was in now. Getting knocked up in the  lame hope of gaining that protection would cause a new world of chaos and hurt.  And, ultimately, what would be the point? How much difference would one kid  make when half of the bloody amazons were indirectly spawned from her-via the Nyanniichuan-anyway?</p><p>Ranko's  head jerked up.</p><p>"That's it…" she murmured,  just before an alarm flashed through her skull, forcing her to dodge  acrobatically through a barrage of coruscating spheres of focused chi. For the  next six seconds, she twisted, leapt, rolled and pivoted madly to evade the  opening assault from Prince Herb. Somewhere in the first dozen evasions, she  was forced to strip off her backpack and toss it deep into the woods to keep it  from tripping her up. She had barely enough breathing space to snarl in  irritation over the fact that he was shooting at long range from the air, as he  flew in to confront her. The clearing she was in had grown by an acre, and  become cluttered by the trunks of a few dozen trees, by the time he reached it  and touched down across from her.</p><p>"Herb!" she hissed  angrily, flaring up dangerously.</p><p>"Ranko,"  he inclined his head. To her surprise, he held out his hands to offer a  temporary truce. When he saw her hesitate, he spoke, "Out of respect for  having saved my life, I must offer you the chance to surrender."</p><p>"Are you kidding!" she  shouted, completely dropping her guard. When he merely arched an eyebrow and  crossed his arms, she composed herself. If he had not been serious, he would  have attacked in that moment. Her eyes hardened angrily. "Forget it, Herb.  There's no point to this." As she took a breath to explain what she had  just realized, he suddenly vanished in a streak of motion. Her fierce rejection  was apparently sufficient cause to annul the "truce" and spur him to  combat. A cloud of dust and leaves whipped up in the wake of his accelerated  charge, further obscuring vision.</p><p>She instantly raised her guard,  "Damn it!"</p><p>Her arms barely intercepted the blow  that solidified from the blur of his attack. Catching the impact on her  cross-braced forearms, she was launched off her feet to crash into a tree on  the edge of the clearing. Rebounding off the trunk, she narrowly dodged his  follow-up strike as he raced in to press his advantage. Chunks of wood and bark  exploded through the space she just vacated as his punch collided with her after  image.</p><p>Channeling chi through her body,  down her legs, she desperately rocketed away, trying to put some distance  between them before he could launch himself at her again. Clearly, he was  taking this fight seriously, striking as hard and fast as he could to overwhelm  her.</p><p>"Herb! Listen to me!" she  demanded, narrowing her eyes to track him as he recovered from his blow and  hurtled back at her.</p><p>He came into focus again right in  front of her, planting his feet to add leverage to the speed of his next blow. Ranko leaned left just enough to allow his fist to miss her  face, and snapped off an amagurikan barrage into his  exposed flank.</p><p>"Hyaaaaaa!"  she cried out, forgoing the effort of naming her attack.</p><p>Herb grunted as the rapid fire  punishment made itself felt through his armor. Riding the force of the blows  back a pace or two, he retorted, "Nothing you could say at this point  would interest me!"</p><p>"But there's no reason for us  to fight!" she cried, stepping back into a purely defensive posture.</p><p>"I thought you were not going  to surrender?" he challenged, summoning his chi while levitating up and  slipping around to flank her.</p><p>"Damn it, Herb! If you really  want to fight, I won't stop you, but at least hear me out!" she shouted,  pivoting to keep him in front of her.</p><p>"You can't stop me. Certainly  not with pathetic excuses or distractions!"</p><p>He followed his retort with the  onslaught of an amped up Ryuu  Sei Hishou, ricocheting  dozens of hard hitting globes of energy off the surrounding rocks and trees to  hammer her from every side. Ranko took the first  couple of blind siding blows across her chin and hip, before summoning up a  wall of chi around herself to ward off his attacks. That seemed to work, until  he maneuvered directly over head and dropped a veritable bomb straight down on  her. Taking the blow on the crown of her head, she was crushed to her knees,  and nearly keeled over as her limbs went weak for an instant.</p><p>Ranko  exploited the urge to collapse by relaxing into a fluid roll, to remove herself  from ground zero, as Herb streaked downward in a chi-cloaked chisel kick. The  ground was split open into a wide fissure by the knife edge of his foot as it  pierced the earth. Ranko kept rolling until she was  clear of the rift, where she coiled back up to her feet. If Herb continued to  press her this hard, Ranko could soon have more to  worry about than merely losing to him. One misstep or bit of mistiming and she  could very easily become crippled or maimed to boot. Shaking her head and  jumping back to give her some distance she began to wave her arms for his  attention. "Hold it!'</p><p>"Not a chance!" Herb  sneered, rushing forward again.</p><p>"I'm serious, Herb! You need to  stop for a sec and listen!" Ranko growled,  flaring her aura mightily to reinforce her command.</p><p>"I know better than to give you  time to think, Saotome," Herb chided with a dry  smirk. Still he slowed his advance a touch.</p><p>"It's you who needs to stop and  think! Do you have any idea what just happened to me? Do you have any idea what  any of it means?"</p><p>"I assume you think whatever  you have to say will somehow change the outcome of this contest."</p><p>"I know it does!" Ranko shouted in growing irritation, dodging casually as he  closed the range and began a series of strikes.</p><p>"If you are so certain then,  perhaps you should wager the difference for me to hear you out," Herb  challenged coldly, maintaining the rhythm of his attacks.</p><p>"What? What do you mean?" Ranko blinked and recoiled. Her shock almost caused her to  take a hit to the temple. Once again she was forced to retreat.</p><p>Once separated again, the combatants  paused. A breeze stirred up a cloud of leaves stripped loose from the fallen  trees of their battle field. The dragon prince relaxed his guard to study the  form of his opponent more intently, more appraisingly, while considering her  question. He was also reflecting upon her responses to each of his recent  provocations. He had known that Ranko would be less  susceptible than Fa Shen to  manipulation through amazon law, but she was also  proving to be less hot headed than Ranma. She was a  slippery fish, and he needed to hook her more securely before he could reel her  in. Anticipating the basis of her protest against this fight, it was simple  enough to bait her into making a more binding wager. "It is becoming clear  to me that it is useless to try to claim you against your will. I sincerely  doubt that amazon law is sufficient to compel you to  marry even if I defeat you. That is evident in your protests. Thus, before I  condescend to hear whatever excuses you presume would negate the value of this  fight, I require that you guarantee the stakes of this fight on your  honor."</p><p>Ranko took  a sharp breath. "You mean, I gotta agree to marry you if I lose before you'll let me  tell you why I don't gotta marry you if I lose?"</p><p>"That is correct," Herb  nodded regally.</p><p>"That's insane!" Ranko exploded.</p><p>"Those are my terms," Herb  snapped, shifting his balance to resume the offensive.</p><p>"Wait!" Ranko held up her hand. If she gave her word, Herb would  have the leverage to force her into marriage. Only an immediate obstacle would  foil that gambit. "What if I'm not even available to marry?" she  tried to counter, cringing at the though of trying to hide behind Ryouga or Akane. "I can't  promise to marry you if I'm already married to someone else!"</p><p>Herb was nonplussed. "Are you  suggesting you have been defeated since we last spoke?"</p><p>"I'm just trying to tell you, I  merged with Ranma and Fa Shen when I was merging with my guy side!"</p><p>Herb blinked and stormed forward.  "This is nonsense! You were locked! You can't have merged with your male  half!"</p><p>Ranko  blushed but stood her ground. "That shows what you know, Herb! Because you  locked me in that split state, I had no choice but to try and infect myself  with a chi curse based on the instant!" Seeing the look of confusion on  his face, she rapidly explained the things she and her friends had discovered  starting with Ryouga being branded with the ghost of  his pig curse. Herb listened in spite of himself, but unlike a normal Jusenkyo curse, Ranko could not  easily demonstrate the new curse to prove it. Instead, she asserted,  "Let's heat up some water. If I turn back into a guy, that will prove what  I am telling you."</p><p>Herb glared at her in mingled  disgust and frustration. With jerky movements, he produced a flask  of water from the folds of his shadow and proceeded to heat it with his chi. This  situation was not something Herb could have anticipated, but it still presented  useful leverage. "If what you are saying is true, you still owe me for listening  to your explanation. If you are fused with Ranma and Fa Shen, and thus obligated to  honor their marriages to Ryouga and Akane, I am still within my rights to challenge them to  secure my claim to you. I would consider accepting your word to honor a union  with me in return for giving you my assurances that I will not slay or grievously  injure your other suitors."</p><p>Ranko  looked up at him unhappily as he restated his terms. She was less than pleased  to have him remind her of the threats he had made against her friends, family  and the amazons when he confronted her at the manor. Swearing under her breath  while holding out her hand for the heated flask,  she muttered to herself, "Stupid, stupid, stupid! I shouldn't have  involved them!" Ryouga was an impressive martial  artist, the closest thing Ranko had to a peer in the  art, but he would not fare well against Herb, and Akane  did not stand a chance. Her brain revved into high gear, painting an ugly  picture of the ways the people she cared about could be used to force her bow  to him. Suddenly this fight had a more important purpose. Instead of fighting  merely to win, she had to somehow secure the safety of everyone she cared  about. That would take some smart wording, she realized. Unfortunately that was  never her strong suit. Herb finished heating the water, but pulled the flask  out of her reach as she tried to grab it. "Hey!" she blurted aloud.</p><p>"Your word, Ranko.  Give me your word or this parlay is over," Herb grated.</p><p>Ranko  snatched the flask out of his hands and growled, "Fine. But this is a one  time offer. If you can defeat me today-honorably-and you promise on whatever  you hold sacred not to hurt the people I care about, no matter who wins, I'll  marry you. Not that it really matters, since I am NOT going to lose." With  that, she tipped the open flask  over her head. To her relief, the familiar tingle of transformation passed  through her, once she remembered to "unlock" the chisuiiton  effect.</p><p>Herb's disappointment at seeing Ranko assume male form was unmistakable. Still, he had her  hooked, he smiled and returned, "You have my word."</p><p>"That reminds me, you have to  hear me out now, so let's start with this," Ranko  gestured to himself. "I will always be as much a man as I am a woman, and  now there's nothing you can do to prevent it. Do you really want to be married  to another guy, Herb?" he offered an evil smirk.</p><p>"It is an inconvenience. All  that matters is that the ability you have to lock yourself in female form makes  you capable of bearing children to term."</p><p>"Which brings up the topic of  sex," Ranko leered. Something in the back of his  brain was warning that it might not be a good idea to bait the dragon prince  like this, but Ranko felt oddly reluctant to reveal  his real reason for disputing the challenge, now that Herb had made it a  personal challenge. All Ranko could really do now was  try to discourage Herb from wanting him altogether. "Have you really given  any thought to what it would mean to be married to me? Have you stopped to ask  yourself if you can be in an intimate relationship with someone you forced into  it?"</p><p>"I do not care to discuss  this," Herb spat, looking away. "You seem to be under the impression  that I am under any less duress than you."</p><p>"Now who's making  excuses?" Ranko retorted softly.</p><p>"You know nothing. The  obligations of my station and heritage are beyond your grasp."</p><p>"Then explain it to me!" Ranko shouted. "Explain to me how being the prince of  some dead empire gives you the right to mess with my life!"</p><p>"You would not exist if not for  that 'dead' empire, Saotome," Herb reminded Ranko acidly. "You and I are both products of the same  culture. At least I have the decency to honor and respect my heritage and  ancestry." Herb was finding this discussion less and less palatable the longer  he looked at Ranko's male countenance. In a gesture  of pure spite, he produced another flask of water, slashing it open with a  knife drawn from his left sleeve, to douse Ranko with  its chill contents.</p><p>"Hey!" she sputtered after  taking the splash right in the face. "What was that for? Can't take me as  a guy?"</p><p>"Do not delude yourself. I  simply have no desire to have this battle with another man. I might forget my  intentions and kill you."</p><p>"Maybe I should return the  favor," Ranko fumed, wiping her face and  slicking her bangs out of her eyes. Not surprisingly, he used the moment her  vision was obscured to launch another attack. Ranko  was forced to twist and leap evasively for several moments, protesting angrily,  "Hey! You're supposed to be listening to me! Dammit,  Herb!"</p><p>"What more is there to say, Saotome? I have your word, you have mine. Is there anything  else to dispute?"</p><p>"Not that you'd care, I see.  Just remember, you only get this chance, then me and mine are off limits!"</p><p>"Don't be a fool. I am bound to  leave your loved ones alone, but even if I lose I will continue to pursue you  as my bride, by whatever means necessary."</p><p>Ranko was  forced to choke on her response, as her anger caused her to surge forward in  anger and take a stiff kick in the ribs.</p><p>"You almost make it too  easy," Herb grinned, following up on his advantage to drop her to her  knees and then whip kick her from the boulder she had perched on, spinning  toward a pile of shattered stone and wood. Leaping up, he came arcing down to  deliver a combination of chi bombs and a descending kick.</p><p>"You wish!  That's your last cheapshot, Herb!" Ranko shouted, twisting her body, deflecting a pair of chi  spheres, then launching herself up in a cross counter kick. Gritting her teeth,  she braced for what could become the hardest fight of her life. She had done  her best to reason with him, and even if he never left her alone, she had his  word that everyone else was protected from him. It was a relief to stop holding  back, especially since she could not afford to remain on the defensive against  Herb. Sensing-more than seeing -him closing in again, she twisted herself  into a whirlwind of kicks and chops. Each maneuver positioned her inside his  guard, forcing him to stumble back and give ground, remaining unbalanced, or  accept a string of coordinated hits, as kick flowed into punch, into knee ram,  into elbow strike, topped off by brutal back hand.</p><p>It took Herb about ten seconds to  realize he did not want to be in close fighting range of the red-headed Cuisinart. Unfortunately, it took him about ten minutes to  extract himself from the intricate ferocity of her dance. Maybe if he were in  female form, he might have had the speed necessary to effectively block or  counter-strike and regain the initiative. Instead, he was forced to offer her a  delicate target, absorb her attack, and then trap her in a bind where his  superior strength and leverage could be put to use.</p><p>Even then, she writhed and twisted  like an eel, practically slithering up his front until she could escape by  planting one foot on his shoulder and use the other to launch herself off the  top of his head-kicking away from him as she sent him down in a face plant.  For a few moments, Herb had to fire off a blind string of chi blasts, and more  dangerous Hitou Ryuu-zan Ha  chi blades, targeting by the sound of her rebounding from tree trunk to boulder  to overhanging branch. It was about this point in the battle when Herb realized  he was actually enjoying himself.</p><p>"It's nice to see you haven't  lost your touch," he quipped, finally regaining his feet and coming around  properly to track her as she flew from perch to perch. He had to throw himself  to the side, however, since she had lined him up for a chi blast of her own as  the momentum of his strafing run died.</p><p>"That's because I'm the  best," she snapped right back.</p><p>"Feh.  A true warrior doesn't try to take credit for luck!" he sniped.</p><p>Ranko had  continued to rocket along, flying hard into a tree top, her feet braced against  a long, sturdy branch, feeling it bend under her weight and momentum, then  riding the recoil straight back into Herb's face. As she shot forward, her  hands snapped apart, dividing the ball of chi she had been building up after  her last shot into ring of negatively charged energy and a knot of compressed  positive chi. "Wrath of Heaven!" she shouted, with an evil smile.</p><p>Herb's eyes widened as he realized  he was grounded in the center of the clearing, unable to escape the noose of  this devastating attack. His only avenue of escape was through the loop.  Recognizing this as a potential fight stopper, he had instants to make a  difficult, potentially damning decision. Just as his movement was dictated by Ranko's attack, so were hers. One hand slipped  instinctively into his sleeve, where he had resheathed  his dagger. It was the only advantage he had. Snarling, he gathered his chi and  tried to rocket through the center faster than Ranko  could close the trap.</p><p>"Snapping Jaws!" she  cried, already on a course to intercept him, releasing the black bolt still in  her hands directly into his face with an echoing clap. As the positive charge  lanced through him, the ring of ethereal fire discharged into Herb, unleashing  its elemental fury in a blinding disk of lightning. Ranko  twisted and writhed in mid air, passing a hairsbreadth from Herb's form as she  slithered past him, threading the eye of her own attack. As she flashed by, he  landed a numbing blow to her exposed abdomen. That was all he had time for,  however, as momentum carried them off in opposite directions.</p><p>Ranko  flipped over gracefully to land poised on her toes, facing her opponent. She  caught a glimpse of Herb plummeting senseless to the ground, wreathed in  lightning, while discovering she felt oddly lightheaded. Herb must have knocked  the wind out of her, she realized. Attempting to fill her lungs, she was  surprised to find she could not, and shocked that the attempt sent a searing  lance of pain from her naval to her collarbones. The root of the horrible pain  was right where he had struck her. She raised a hand reflexively to explore the  injury, unwilling to take her eyes off her foe while at the slightest  disadvantage. Then her hand encountered the hilt of the wicked dagger he had  impaled her with. The reflexive gasp sent another tear of agony through her, as  she stared down in absolute disbelief.</p><p>"You stabbed me!" she  mewled, wasting what shallow breath she had. The hilt was angled, intersecting  her midriff just above her navel and indicating the presence of a blade pointed  mercilessly toward her heart. Realization brought restored sensation, and Ranko knew the knife pierced her diaphragm and punctured at  least one of her lungs. Her acrobatics had twisted it around inside her,  compounding the damage. Only the seal of blood around the foreign object  permitted her to draw a few shallow, excruciating breaths to fight off the  assault of oblivion.</p><p>She could not believe it. How could  he risk killing her if his intention was to marry her? Such an attack should  not have even been a possibility! But there it was, a blood soaked dagger  pouring her life out onto the dirt. To draw it out was to sign her death  warrant, but there was no way she could continue to fight while it impaled her.  Either way, she could hardly breathe. Without breath, she was doomed.</p><p>Sinking to her knees, carefully  cradling the weapon to prevent further damage, she cursed Herb furiously in her  mind.</p><p>Across the clearing, Herb began to  pry himself up off the ground. He too was struggling to remain conscious,  charred and smoking from the searing fury of her attack. Damaged though he was,  he remained intact. Slowly, painfully, he forced himself to his hands and knees  and turned to study Ranko.</p><p>She glared at him, tightening her  hand around the hilt of his dagger. If he dared to approach her, she swore to  herself she would rip the blade out of her gut and bury it in his throat.</p><p>"It's over, Ranko,"  he croaked, beginning to inch toward her. "You cannot continue to  fight."</p><p>"Try me!" she spat  vindictively, forcing the words out with a trickle of blood. Drawing upon the  limitless well of ki, she willed it through her body,  focusing on the wound in her abdomen.</p><p>"Damn it! You lost! Admit it,  so I can help you!" he shouted.</p><p>"Never! You had…" Ranko's voice quit, and she panted to fill her lungs and  continue, "…the right… idea…. The only… way…" The effort was making  her vision dance, but she was determined to have her say. "The only way…  you… will EVER… haaaahh… defeat me… nnnnrnh… is to… KILL… ME!"</p><p>Herb gasped as she began to collapse  forward in exhaustion. In a panic, he lunged forward to catch her, before she  folded and drove the blade into her heart. "NO!"</p><p>To his shock, she flinched back at  his approach, ripping the blade free and leveling it at his throat. If he had  not come up short in shock, he would have spitted his neck on it. He instantly  seized her arm, eyes flickering down to see her other fist shoved into the now  open wound. "Ranko! Please…" At Horiisan, Herb had been impressed with Ranko's  sheer nerve and determination, or at the time, Ranma's  indomitable will. Once again, he found himself astounded by Ranko's  unbreakable spirit. It was only a small step to progress from that respect and  admiration to something far stronger, aided by the attraction he had been  fighting and the concern that suddenly overwhelmed him.</p><p>"Damn…" she wheezed,  struggling weakly to wrest her striking arm from his grip. Sagging, she closed  her eyes, looking inward for some other way to avenge herself. Strangely, the  weaker her grip on the flesh became, the stronger the pulse of her ki became. Her mind flashed to the instant before her  fusion, remembering the way she had burned from within as the power inside her  exceeded her capacity to endure. A bitter smirk touched her lips as it struck  her that she was more deadly, stark naked and aroused, than a thousand blades.</p><p>"You stupid woman! Do you want  to die!" Herb demanded as she lunged forward and snapped her free hand  from the wound in her gut over his shoulder, pressing herself against him in a  parody of a hug while knotting his long, violet and white hair in her fist. In  the heat of the moment, in the intimacy of their pose, Herb was seared by  feelings and sensations he was helpless against, feelings a man could have for  a woman, which his upbringing had never prepared him for.</p><p>"Do you?" she purred,  ignoring the sickly gurgle deep in her throat. The sensation of all bodily  warmth pouring out through the open wound, soaking  them from the waist down, was harder to  dismiss. Her insides had to be terribly shredded to cause such bleeding, and  that banished whatever fleeting hope she had of surviving much longer. Pressing  her cheek against his, and summoning every ounce of ki  she could command to surge forth, she panted into his ear, "I meant… to te-ehhh… tell you… There was… no… way… you could w-uhhh… win. I… am… the… Ny-an… nii… chuan…"</p><p>"What? Stop it, Ranko. Save your breath…" he begged, terrified by the  sudden ache in his chest, the fear of losing her.</p><p>"Shut… UP!" she hissed,  jerking his head back by his hair. Taking a moment to gulp for air, she then  announced, "It m-mah… makes… me… unnnnnh… matriarch…" By now, the ki  she was building up was wreathing both of them in diaphanous blue. Ultimately,  pain, anger, and hatred, had all fallen away as she grew confident of her  victory.</p><p>Herb blinked, trying in vain to pull  back to stare into her eyes. "What!" he could not help shouting, but  at the same time the logic of her statement made itself clear. Ranko had thought her way out of the trap. She had found a  defense against all challengers, and the key to assuming power among the  amazons. The implications were staggering, and the tragedy of the moment doubly  profound.</p><p>Ranko  coughed, spilling warm crimson fluid along Herb's neck. The next breath she  took gurgled sickeningly. Herb was about to beg her once more to stop trying to  talk, gathering her in his arms as he prepared to fly her back to the village  in the desperate hope there was still time to save her. But Ranko's  words stopped him cold.</p><p>"Hey, He-urghk…  Herb. Do you… know…?" her first attempt to ask dwindled below the  threshold of hearing. Refocusing herself, and noticing that her hand was  beginning to glow from within, she rasped, "Do… you… kn-Nnnrrrhh…  know… wh-what… I… am? What… Pa… Sh-Shen…  was?"</p><p>Herb could practically feel the  smile on her face.</p><p>When he said noting, she decided his  stiffening in shock was sufficient answer. "I di'nt…  think… I… would… te… ssssst  't so… sooonnn," she trailed off breathlessly as  her body went slack. Cursing herself, she prayed he would not realize the  danger he was in and escape before she could unleash the power she had  collected.</p><p>Herb did suddenly realize what she  was doing. Her final act would fulfill her promise. She was going to kill him. His  respect, admiration and concern peaked and in that instant he realized it. He  had fallen in love. Feeling her go limp, he sensed he had a heartbeat to launch  himself away and summon his own ki to shield himself.  But, as he pulled away from her, he could not help but look at the wound he  inflicted. The gushing crimson torrent had trickled to nothing. Instead,  brilliant light poured out of her gut. The hole in the blood soaked shirt was  hard to see through, but as he shifted back, he noticed that the light that was  spilling out of her wound was diminishing. Like a ray of sun piercing a  thickening cloud, the brilliant beam was gradually winking out. The aperture  was closing.</p><p>The power she intended to kill him  with was actually healing her.</p><p>"Ranko!"  he shouted in excitement, seizing her by the arms and staring into her listless  eyes. Her face was so pale, the loss of blood alone was proving to be a  traumatic blow to her system. She did not realize her wounds were being  repaired. She felt herself losing consciousness, believed she was dying. Herb  fought to get her attention, to tell her she was healed. "Ranko," he spoke more gently, urging her to respond.  Her lids flickered for a moment then opened. As she focused her vision on his  face, a strange, triumphant smile stretched across her face.</p><p>"I… win…" she chirped  confidently. Then she cut loose.</p>
