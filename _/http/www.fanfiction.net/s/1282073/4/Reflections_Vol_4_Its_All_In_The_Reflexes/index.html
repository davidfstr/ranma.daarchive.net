</div>It's All In The Reflexes<p>A  Reflections Mini-Sequel</p><p>A. V.  Morgan</p><p>Author's  Note: <b>It's All In The Reflexes</b> focuses on a chain of events that is  referred back to in the beginning of the official sequel to <b>Reflections</b>,  <b>Refractions</b>, which is currently being plotted and written. I did not  have a set length for <b>Reflexes</b>, just the idea of Akane going ballistic  on Ranma and what the Amazons would think of that. Rather than make you, the  readers, wait for <b>Refractions</b>, I decided to give you a little taste by  exploring what started as a joke in the opening arc. Hopefully, it will be only  6-10 parts long. This also gives me some time to think about some of the  responses I've been getting to <b>Reflections</b> of late. While <b>Reflections</b>  could not avoid being confusing, the ending was rushed. I admit that. Try to  remember, starting around Part Ten of <b>Reflections</b>, I surrendered to  inspiration, with only token acknowledgement of other intentions or opinions.  That opened the door for a lot of fun and interesting ideas to take root. The  story really did not want to come to a close. I am not sure what I could or  would change, if I fixed the ending, but most likely, I would expand the ending  by a full volume (15 parts), giving a little more attention to the trip, the  confrontations with Herb, and the evolution of relationships and curses. Note,  I am not talking about changing the ending, just spacing things out a bit so  that it makes a little more sense. I am just at the mulling over stage on that,  so any comments or feedback would be appreciated. If I drastically revised or  rewrote it, I would not have foundation for this story or <b>Refractions</b>.  Of course, anyone who has stuck with me this far is obviously extremely  tolerant and forgiving. I really appreciate that, and I am not going to insult  that by gutting the story you've enjoyed thus far.</p><p>So, on  with the show!</p><p>A. V.  Morgan</p><p>Part  Four</p><p>On her  way to retrieve Ranma, Ranko passed by a villager's kitchen window. Now, this  should not have been anything to be concerned about, but several other factors  applied. One, she was cursed to turn into a boy with hot water. Two, her  boyfriend had a similar curse, and she had noticed that he was going out of his  way to be a girl around her, which was very frustrating. Three, she had responded  by leaving her curse unlocked, so she could respond by becoming male—what else  could she do when her significant other refused to remain the opposite sex?  Four, walking around with an active curse was tempting the gods of chance and  chaos. Summed up, and in conclusion, the inhabitant of that hut chose the  moment she walked by to toss out his dish water, dousing Ranko. Naturally, it  was just hot enough to trigger her curse. Stopping, and looking down at himself  in disgust, he paused to strip off his shirt to wring it out, squirming  uncomfortably as the panties the former girl had been wearing proved much too  tight and constricting for his present endowments. Fortunately, the halter top  was a simple, cotton athletic bra, stretching flat and tight over his broad  chest. But it looked pretty stupid, so he stripped that off, tucking it into  his pocket before slithering back into the damp, silk shirt.</p><p>"I swear, I need to get my underwear  cursed too!" he spat, shaking his head free of moisture.</p><p>Making a mental note to check with  Cologne, or the village archive, to see if there was any way to enchant panties  and bras to turn into boxers and t-shirts, he shuffled on through the village.  The last he saw, Ranma had been flying out of it towards the fields farmed by  the tribe.</p><p>Lost in thought, he came within an  inch of crashing head-long into Ukyo. With a start, Ranko dodged her, but his  friend reached out and grabbed him by the shirt, whipping him off his feet into  an abrupt throw that sent him flying. Colliding roughly with a wall, upside  down, Ranko instantly slid down, cracking his head on the foundation stones of  the hut. After collapsing in a heap, he rolled to the side and sprang up, ready  to demand an explanation for the violent greeting.</p><p>"Ucchan! What the…"</p><p>"How DARE you, Ranma!" Ukyo roared,  slapping him sharply across the cheek.</p><p>"Ouch! Wha…" Ranko flinched back,  raising a hand to his face. "Ucchan!"</p><p>"Don't call me that! You're not a  real friend! You… you're sick, Ranma!" she accused hotly, still frothing over  what she had just learned from Akane. "I can't believe you'd even THINK of  doing something like that to Ranko!"</p><p>"Huh?" Ranko blinked. Pointing  nervously to himself, he began, "But I'm…"</p><p>"I don't want to hear your sick  excuses! I am SO glad I found out about this now!" she cried, anger suddenly  giving way to a spill of tears. "To think, I was actually thinking seriously  about keeping the engagement with you."</p><p>"Ucch… Ukyo…" Ranko swallowed,  extending a cautious hand to his best friend. "I know what Akane must have said  to you, but she's got it all wrong!"</p><p>"You know, usually that's true!"  Ukyo snapped, bracing her hands on her hips, glaring through liquid eyes.  "Akane's always been wrong about Ranko, but I'm not buying it this time. She  SAW you with Fa Shen! I don't know what you did to Ranko to make her cover for  you… Akane also heard you talking about having sex with Ranko, PLAIN AS DAY!"  she shouted. Taking a quick breath, she lowered her voice and raised a tight  fist toward him, "Well, listen to this. You so much as lay a hand on Ranko, and  I will take your head clean off. It's just wrong, Ranma! I don't know what  happened to you, but you and Fa Shen need help."</p><p>Ranko was completely flabbergasted.  He should have known Akane would not hesitate to spill all the details. All it  took was for her to get angry enough, self-righteous enough to assume everyone  would see she was the injured party, and she would overcome her concern over  how "Ranma's" actions reflected on her. What better way to dissociate herself  from the "pervert" than by using proof of his perversions to damn him. Fighting  for coherence, Ranko ground out through clenched teeth, "You don't understand…"</p><p>Ukyo lunged forward and hissed, "I  don't want to understand. I don't want to know how you think you can justify  this. I know guys, Ranma. I thought you were different, but you're just like  the rest. As soon as you 'get some' you can't walk away. You're gonna sleep  with Fa Shen until she figures out that you're just using her. I can even see  how you got her to conspire with you against Ranko… I bet you told her that a  neat little three way with her would be a lot of fun. Well, wake up. I am not  going to let you use MY Ranchan like that!"</p><p>Ranko began shaking, as the urge to  explode welled up inside him. "I can't believe you! That is just… sick!" he  growled, bringing his head up to fix Ukyo with a dangerous look. "You have it  all wrong, Ukyo. For one thing, I AM NOT RANMA!" he emphasized in a very low  voice, doing everything he could to keep from bellowing at her. A spark of  doubt entered Ukyo's eye, as it finally registered that Ranko's clothes were  damp. Stepping forward, Ranko continued, "Akane doesn't know what she's talking  about, because SHE WON'T LISTEN to any of us! SO, when you feel up to LISTENING  maybe we can talk about this." Whipping away from the brown-haired girl, Ranko  stomped off. Finding Ranma could wait. Akane needed to be dealt with NOW.</p><p>Ukyo stood in place, devastated by  comprehension. "R-Ranko…?"</p><p>Ranko did not even pick up the  plaintive call. His attention was focused on sustaining some mental separation  between himself and Ranma. The last thing he could afford in a confrontation  with Akane was to slip into that old mindset that made him her whipping boy.  Even with the offended rage his confrontation with Ukyo had summoned, Ranko was  not inclined to hurt Akane, but if he dropped his guard for the sake of boyish  affection, Akane would hurt him and nothing would get resolved. He stormed  along, repeating over and over the mantra, 'I am the eye of the storm. My will  is a pillar of calm. I wrap the rage around me, so I come to no harm. I am the  eye of the storm.' Ranko did not want to make the mistake Ranma had made in  failing to use Fa Shen's Pillar of Calm technique while confronting Akane. It  was ironic that the technique required intense anger to focus and project  serenity. Since Akane did not have any chi discipline, when Ranko transferred  the Pillar of Calm to her, it would completely dissipate her rage. When he turned  onto a path and spotted Akane facing him at the other end, he felt ready.</p><p>To his irritation, Akane froze,  turned on her heel, and walked directly away.</p><p>"Akane! Wait!" he called out,  sprinting to catch up.</p><p>Over her shoulder, she shouted, "I'm  not talking to you!"</p><p>Growling, Ranko grabbed her by the  shoulder and replied, "Fine! At least listen!"</p><p>Turning and taking a step back,  Akane put up her guard and snarled, "Why? So you can make excuses? I don't want  to hear it!"</p><p>Already, they had been noticed and  villagers scooted closer to watch the fireworks. With a sigh, Ranko schooled  his features, nursing his calm. "You deserve an explanation. Don't you at least  want to know what is really going on? Don't you want to know the truth, before  you go on telling people what you THINK happened?" he challenged.</p><p>Akane bit down on a retort. She  expected Ranma to deny his guilt, to proclaim her ignorance and stupidity or  insult her. The anger that had fed on her all day had begun to exhaust her, but  the underlying hurt was throbbing. Allowing that agony into her voice she  protested, "Do you really think knowing all the sordid details is going to make  up for what you did?"</p><p>"I didn't do anything, Akane! I'm  not…" but before Ranko could reveal that he was not Ranma, Akane was already  reacting to the words, hearing the denial she expected.</p><p>"God! I knew it! I knew you'd keep  trying to deny it!" the flames of fury swiftly engulfed her.</p><p>"Shit!" Ranko cursed, recognizing  that he had to strike now, quench the flames, and then try to straighten things  out. As quick as the realization, his hand snapped out, aimed for the center of  Akane's chest. Unfortunately, Akane shifted her weight and flinched at that  moment, causing Ranko's hand to land squarely on her right breast.</p><p>"Oh, no…" he muttered, in that  instant of realizing what he'd done.</p><p>Akane growled in hate, "God DAMMIT!  You just CAN'T keep your HANDS to YOURSELF!" The words she stressed were  emphasized as she jerked back, cocked her right fist, slapped her left hand across  Ranko's cheek with a sharp crack, and then stepped in to deliver a brutal  roundhouse to the other side of his jaw. Ranko flew sideways off the path, over  the lip of the ravine concealed by bushes, and headlong down into the creek  below.</p><p>As he splashed into the water, Ranko  was still stunned at the unexpected sensation of soft, warm flesh occurring  where his hand should have encountered the solidity of her breastbone. The  shock of cold water helped restore normal thinking. 'I guess that would screw up  the technique…' she thought miserably. "Akane's a jinx!" she hissed. The  insufferable tomboy had clobbered all three of the triplets now, and still they  had not gained a millimeter in driving any sense into her stubborn, reactionary  skull. Scrambling to her feet, and up the steep bank of the creek, Ranko burst  back onto the path. "Akane!" she called out, whipping her head around to spot  the raven-haired girl.</p><p>"You too late," an amazon  pronounced. "Man-girl just defeat Ranma and run off again."</p><p>"Uh, yeah… I kinda know that  already!" Ranko rubbed her jaw. "Dammit!"</p><p>"You tell Ranma, better hurry up and  give kiss. Be bad she accidentally attack Ranko in boy form," another amazon  added, just as Ranko was opening her mouth.</p><p>"Maybe you tell Akane, kiss of marriage  much better than kiss of death. She be more careful, yes?" the first counseled  soberly.</p><p>"Maybe she stop resisting Ranma when  try to kiss."</p><p>As they walked off, Ranko remained  standing with her mouth open. She had been that close to explaining that this  fight had not been with Ranma at all. "What was I thinking!" she wailed  softly. Frowning in thought, she searched her mind to see if Akane had been  officially declared an ally of the tribe. Coming up with nothing, she realized  why the tribe members were so quick to endorse the "man-girl" view of Akane. An  outsider GIRL would have to be insane to cut loose like that on an amazon, even  if "she" was only an honorary woman. With a stricken look, Ranko realized  something truly horrible. "Oh, God. Ranma can't EVER be defeated by a girl!  ShitshitshitshitSHIT!"</p><p>Suddenly, it was more important to  find Ranma than Akane.</p><p>"I'll deal with you later, Tomboy,"  she promised, resuming her original search.</p><p>Ranma  was not hard to find, having made his way back from the fields by the time  Ranko was crossing the center of the village. Literally running into each  other, the two picked each other up, and Ranko dragged an unresisting Ranma off  to lunch. On the way, she carefully pointed out to Ranma the danger of allowing  himself to be defeated by an outsider girl. His typical aversion to fighting  girls was fine, if it kept him out of fights, but IN a fight, he could no  longer afford to drop his guard. Fighting girls was much preferable to having  to kill them.</p><p>"We have to get these stupid laws  changed!" Ranma declared.</p><p>"Hey, I agree with you," Ranko  insisted animatedly. "That's been my plan since Cologne cornered us into  accepting our 'heritage'. But, it's not going to happen quickly, so we have to  be careful until we can do something."</p><p>"I still say we should have resisted  becoming amazons," Ranma complained.</p><p>"I wish we could have. But what's  the choice? They don't ever back down. One on one, MAYBE the elders can take us  on and win. With the three of us working together, I doubt any of the amazons  could beat us. But short of killing them, we can't really beat them for good,"  Ranko paused at the mouth of an ally, gesturing for Ranma to block the entrance  while she pulled off her shirt, slipped back into her halter and adjusted her  clothes. Having gotten used to the support, she quickly became too  uncomfortable walking around in girl form without a bra of some sort. Not  surprisingly, the thought next to "bra" was labeled "pervert". She frowned and  shook her head. "Speaking of bras… I mean… killing, what are we going to do the  next time we see the old letch?" she inquired, stepping out of the ally and  resuming their walk to the Matriarch's House.</p><p>"If there was anyone who deserved  it…" Ranma grit his teeth. With a shake of his head, "I'm not gonna go all  Ryouga about it, but I did vow to kill Happosai for exposing everything to Mom.  I don't think Fa Shen would even hesitate. She was not holding back in that  fight any. He only got the drop on us with the compact 'cuz we thought she DID  kill him."</p><p>Ranko chuckled, "That was some quick  thinkin' on Nabiki and Kasumi's part, though, wasn't it?"</p><p>"Heh. Nice to see Akane's cooking  was good for somethin' at least," he grinned evilly. He sobered up quickly,  remembering that it was the same cooking that had resurrected a bit of the old  ultra-violence. "I'm gonna have to kick myself for thinkin' it was a good thing  she was back to 'normal'. Maybe you should lock yourself as a girl until we get  this mess with Akane cleared up. I don't like the idea that you'd be forced to  give her the kiss of death if she got caught beating you up by mistake."</p><p>"What about Fa Shen's plan?" Ranko  reminded him.</p><p>"I dunno. It doesn't look like we  really mastered the curses yet. I suppose we could just switch back and she  could fight Akane in this one, since it won't change accidentally with water,"  Ranma shrugged. With a sigh of exasperation, he added, "Of course, we have to  get the damn compact back from Akane if we wanna try that. I guess we'll have  to work on getting that back by tonight."</p><p>"And have Fa Shen pose as you just  to beat Akane up?" Ranko got wide eyed.</p><p>Ranma studied her. "If you could  stay a guy right now, would you be able to do it?"</p><p>Ranko rubbed her knuckles, "Heh.  She's askin' for a real fight, that's for sure."</p><p>"But could you… you know. Do you  think you could bring yourself to knock her out?"</p><p>Ranko shook her head sadly. "I don't  know if I could do that to Ryouga anymore."</p><p>"And they say you always hurt the  one you love…" Ranma mused.</p><p>"Like we haven't? Beating people up  isn't the only way to hurt them, Ranma."</p><p>"I wish Akane believed that," Ranma  pouted.</p><p>Ranko grimaced, shoving her hands  into her pockets. They continued in silence, until they were almost at the  house. "We can't have Akane going around sayin' stuff like she did to Ukyo.  What if that gets back to Mom? We kinda gave her the idea that it was just the  one time, and it would never happen again. You know she wants us to be like  brothers and sisters, an' havin' sex together is definitely going to upset her.  I don't think it'll matter to her that there's more to it than that."</p><p>"HER kids can't do anything  disgraceful…" Ranma rephrased it. "Do you think…?"</p><p>"Oh yeah," Ranko did not even need  to hear the question. "There's no more seppuku contract, but that don't mean we  won't have to gut ourselves or slit our throats if we 'dishonor' the family."</p><p>"Kinda makes you think maybe we  don't need the circuit that badly, huh?"</p><p>"The problem is, we don't know that.  I'd hate to need it and not know how to use it."</p><p>"Another no win situation."</p><p>"I'll say this," Ranko turned to  him, stopping at the gate to the Matriarch's yard. "Once you and Fa Shen are  back in your own bodies, we are NOT using it again where any one can find us.  We'll save it for training trips, and once we've got it mastered, we'll only  use it if we HAVE to."</p><p>"Agreed," Ranma nodded sternly.</p><p>Entering the house, they were  greeted by Ryouga, "About time, you two. Fa Shen finished cooking about fifteen  minutes ago, but she wouldn't serve anything until you got here." With that,  she grabbed them and tried to drag them into a closet.</p><p>"Come on, Pork-butt, the dining room  is this way," Ranma grabbed her by the shoulder and reoriented her. The look of  surprise when she stiffened and became immovable was precious.</p><p>Ryouga turned around and declared,  prodding Ranma in the chest with a stiff, rock-hardened finger, "Do. Not. Call.  Me. THAT! I am sick and tired of the pig references, and I am NOT going to take  any comments about my anatomy! Got it!"</p><p>"Hey, man. You know I don't mean  nothin' by that, an' I DO turn into a girl too, remember?" Ranma held up his  hands defensively.</p><p>"Not at the moment," Ryouga reminded  her old rival. With some regret, she remembered that the best part of being  Ranma's boyfriend for a night was that all the animosity between them had been  dispelled. Even after Ranma discovered he was the genuine son, and things began  to fall apart, Nodoka had reacted to the following revelations of Ranma's  curse, original gender, and intimacy with Ryouga, by forcing Ranma to choose  between Ryouga and Akane. Ranma had come very close to giving up manhood  altogether for Ryouga. Then Ranko somehow took back the part of her that had  made Ranma want that. The change had been much harder on Ryouga, who had  tempted fate by proclaiming she would get a girl curse out of love for Ranma.  The whims of fate had made her live up to that promise, but instead of Ranma,  Ryouga's only hope had been with Ranko. By rejecting onna-Ryouga's advances for  Ranko's sake, Ranma had all but resurrected their rivalry. Instead of Akane,  Ranko was the potential focus, and what Ryouga had overheard about Ranma's  alleged interest in her had put her on edge.</p><p>Sensing that there was something  really bothering Ryouga, Ranko asked, "What's got you so upset, Ryou-chan?"</p><p>Ryouga turned to her, "While you  were getting Ranma, I had a little talk with Fa Shen. She says there's  something you all have to explain to me, after hearing what Akane's been saying  about you." Fa Shen heard their voices in the hall and called them to the  table, so Ryouga paused while she was led into the correct room by Ranko. As  they were all getting seated, she continued, "Fa Shen told me to ask you what  happened when you cured Ranko, Ranma."</p><p>Ranma gulped and looked at the  former drowned girl. "Are you sure about this, Fa Shen?"</p><p>"It's time we started telling  people," Fa Shen nodded, gesturing between them. "I'd prefer to just explain it  to Akane, but she won't listen to us. Now we have to tell Ryouga…"</p><p>"And Ukyo," Ranko interrupted,  quickly sketching her confrontation with the chef.</p><p>"…fine, and Ukyo, now," Fa Shen  rephrased with a sigh. "We'll have to get to her next, however. Unless you want  to skip lunch and go looking for her?" she offered her siblings. As expected,  they clutched their bowls defensively, looking pained at the suggestion of  forgoing food. "Right. So, it all started when Ranma and I got together that  first time to heal Ranko…"</p><p>"First time?" Ryouga interrupted, in  a strained, suspicious voice.</p><p>"The first time, Po… p-p-pass the  serving tray, please," Ranma whipped around to stare at Ranko, desperately  avoiding a reflexive "Pork-butt" comment. Coughing and clearing his throat, as  he took the tray from Ranko's hands, he continued. "Ryouga, do you remember how  Ranko was healed almost instantly with just that 'one time'?"</p><p>Ryouga nodded, with eyes narrow.  "But, it wasn't just one time. Why?"</p><p>"Well, there's something we didn't  tell anyone… The part that explains why we sorta have to keep doing it from  time to time," Ranma tried to put it more reasonably.</p><p>Ryouga's eyes widened, and she  turned to Ranko in alarm, "Don't tell me the cure wasn't permanent! Do you  mean, they have to keep having sex to keep you alive?"</p><p>The trio stared at the lost girl in  surprise. For a moment, they imagined what they would have done, if they had  discovered such a thing was necessary. Ranma and Fa Shen turned to Ranko,  looking at her and wondering what it would be like if her survival was dependant  on that. With a shake of her head, Ranko ignored them and informed, "No. The  cure worked fine. There was just a side effect."</p><p>"What do you mean?" Ryouga frowned  over her relief.</p><p>"For one thing, when Fa Shen and I  have sex, it forces us to switch bodies," Ranma began.</p><p>"And, it also creates a kind of  circuit that draws raw ki from our soul," Ranko added.</p><p>"Huh?" Ryouga blinked.</p><p>Very  carefully, over the next hour, the triplets explained everything they had  learned about the strange legacy of the Mirror of Broken Souls. Once they were  sure Ryouga understood the mechanics, and their reasons for the second and  third unions, they tentatively proceeded to explain where things had gone  wrong. "I don't know what she tracked me down for," Ranko commented, after a  quick sip of tea. "To keep from accidentally hurting her, I had to bottle all  that chi up. I can only hold so much of it before it starts to burn me, so I  tried to signal to Ranma and Fa Shen to stop. I didn't want to be fighting for  control of the power an' dealing with Akane at the same time. They missed the  signal, so I stripped off my shirt so some of the heat could dissipate, and  that's when I dropped the compact."</p><p>"Akane snatched it up and dumped us  out…" Ranma tacked on.</p><p>"…while we were still, er… busy," Fa  Shen completed, blushing heavily.</p><p>"Why didn't you just explain it  then…" Ryouga demanded in frustration.</p><p>"Well, Akane sorta blew up, and the  sentries chasin' her were standin' right there practically," Ranko elaborated  with frustrated gestures. "She's so mad at all of us that we can't get her to  listen for two seconds. She even forgot she's not supposed to be bashing Ranma  all over the place!"</p><p>Ryouga pursed her lips in thought,  then dismissed everything to focus on the part she really wanted clarified,  "So, fine. You did it to see if you could master the curses if they weren't  reversed. That's what you were doing at the river, before I ran into Ranko."</p><p>"And it seemed to have worked at  first, but only because…" Ranma cut off, recognizing that he was about to admit  to having the hots for Ranko. "Ranko, do you want to tell him about what it was  like with the copies?"</p><p>Ranko guessed what Ranma wanted her  to explain. "I discovered that the reflections had a way of bringing out  different sides of me. The girl copy brought out my boy side, and the boy copy  brought out my girl side," she admitted. Turning to face Ryouga, she carefully  described the feelings she had experienced with Copy-kun. "The first time I  felt it, I still thought I was Ranma. I was convinced I was a guy. The second  time, he snuck up on me in the bath, and as soon as he touched me it was like  you and me and the koi rod. I… I just responded like I was a girl, completely.  I was so scared, I tried to kill him."</p><p>"But, they're gone. What does this  have to do with anything?" Ryouga wanted to know.</p><p>"Well, the three of us have the same  sort of effect on each other," Ranko revealed.</p><p>"There's a physical side and a  mental side. So, if we're both girls, Ranko brings out the guy in me more than  I bring out the guy in her," Ranma confessed. He then proceeded to explain how  that had caused him to overcome the lock in Fa Shen's body, to transform into a  boy. "Fa Shen tested it with me, and I brought out the girl in her, and  triggered her change. But it's not really control."</p><p>"I heard Fa Shen saying she was  still stuck as a girl, to Ranko, when Akane was accusing you of wanting to  sleep with Ranko," Ryouga reminded them. Uneasily, she asked, "Where did Akane  get the idea that you want that?"</p><p>Ranma sighed, "Well, I actually SAID  something like that. Wait! Lemme explain!" Ryouga stopped just short of  strangling Ranma, only then realizing she had moved to attack. Subsiding, she  nodded for Ranma to continue, "What we were talking about is how Ranko feels  everything we do in the circuit, so it's not like she isn't already involved,  and how we had no idea what would happen if she was actually HAVING sex with  one or both of us. We don't know what would happen, and I was pointing out that  the only way to find out was…"</p><p>"To have sex with Ranko," Ryouga  sagged in depression. With a heavy sigh, she announced, "I don't know what to  think. I mean, yeah, I can understand you wanting to know how this thing works,  but to have to… It makes me want to… Bweee! Snort!"</p><p>The triplets jumped up as Ryouga  seemed to vanish, while her clothes collapsed in on themselves. Coming around  the table, they found the little girl-pig struggling to crawl out of her  clothes.</p><p>"Man! Talk about depressing!" Ranma  quipped.</p><p>Ranko picked up the clothes and her  fiancé, and slipped into the bath. Once Ryouga was changed back, and dressed,  Ranko led her back into the dining area. As usual, the activation of her pig  curse had a very sobering effect on Ryouga, forcing her to bottle her emotions  away, for fear of falling into a depressive loop. While she collected her wits,  the other three cleared the table and rinsed the dishes. When they returned to  their seats, Ryouga was ready with a new question.</p><p>"Obviously, this isn't casual sex.  You wouldn't risk it unless you wanted to trade bodies. I can see why you  thought doing that would make it easier to master your curses, but," she  reached her point, "Why do you really want to master your curses? I mean, come  on, Ranma. I know it was Ranko the whole time, but because she thought she was  you, she hated her curse and tried everything to get rid of it. When you came  back in a hundred-percent-girl body, you couldn't wait to get a guy curse, and  you even had it locked. For all intents and purposes, you and Fa Shen are  normal. Why would you even want to be able to change sex?"</p><p>"I know, I know," Ranma bowed his  head. "I don't have Ranko's excuse. She really is as much a boy as she is a  girl. A blending of me and Fa Shen."</p><p>"Well…" Ranko demurred.</p><p>"Yeah, you've been more of a girl in  your own mind, but I'm betting that's mostly because you're still sorting out  all of Fa Shen's memories," Ranma waved her objection off. "That's your weak  side, so you're concentrating on it, but, what do you think you'll be once you  have both of our lives sorted out?"</p><p>"Er… both," she replied lamely.</p><p>"Right, so, you need the curse, and  you need to master it." Ranko nodded, and Ranma turned back to Ryouga, "Now me,  I'm just a guy who's lived in a girl's body sometimes. That never really  bothered me… er, I mean, that's not a problem as much as dealin' with people  like my dad, who think girls are worthless. Ranko can tell you, that's what I  hated about bein' a girl. The rest of it was just hating the curse and having  no control of my life because of it."</p><p>"So, what, are you saying you  actually liked being a girl?" Ryouga looked perplexed.</p><p>"Ryouga, I can't really admit that,"  Ranma looked around nervously, before lowering his voice and stating carefully,  "but it is true. I didn't know how true it was until I had sex with you."</p><p>Ryouga blushed uncomfortably.</p><p>"I know we sorta agreed not to talk  about it, but there it is. You made me realize that I had somethin' there I did  not wanna give up. There are other advantages to being able to turn into a  girl, but what it boils down to is the fact that there's a part of me that only  works as a girl," Ranma cleared his throat and crossed his arms, "Of course,  there's one more thing."</p><p>"I am sure I've heard enough,"  Ryouga frowned.</p><p>Ranma shook his head and looked  unhappily at Ranko. With a sigh, he proclaimed, "I don't think I have a chance  with Akane without the curse."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Think about it, Ryouga, in Akane's  mind, Ranma is this guy who turns into a girl. As much as she acts like that  offends her, the first time she met me—through Ranko, and again as myself—I was  a girl. She's told me again and again, that the curse didn't affect anything,  but really, she accepted that the curse was part of who I am. Without it, she  can barely tolerate me," Ranma murmured unhappily.</p><p>"You don't really believe that, do  you?" Ryouga jeered.</p><p>"I dunno. You remember how she was  when she found out you'd slept with me, Ryouga," Ranma reminded her. "Well,  finding out you were P-Chan at the same time kinda made her snap, but she let  go of Ranko and started gunning for me. She turned herself into a boy, thinkin'  that would win me. We were getting along okay on the trip. She was freaked out  about things, 'cuz she was a boy at the time, an' I was the girl. Still, that's  the best we've ever gotten along. Then I got my curse and locked it, becoming a  boy full time. Next thing you know, she's treating me like a punching bag  again."</p><p>"It can't be just because you're a  boy, Ranma," Ryouga argued.</p><p>"I don't think it's me, Ryouga. I  think it's her! She was ready to make bacon outta you when you were a boy. But,  you turn into a girl, and suddenly she's forgiving you and plotting to sleep  with you to 'practice' being a boy for me!" Ranma snapped. That made Ryouga blink.  She remembered very well how Akane had strong armed her into that.</p><p>"But…"</p><p>"But what, Ryouga? She's always had  a problem with boys. Either because she was treated like one growing up, or  because they were all after her because she turned out to be a girl…"</p><p>"Cute girl," Ranko interrupted,  glaring at her sibling.</p><p>"But what you are saying," Ryouga  pushed on, "is that you wanna be a girl for Akane?"</p><p>Ranma laughed, "It sounds crazy,  doesn't it?"</p><p>"Well, yeah!"</p><p>Ranma shrugged, "Well, it's your  fault, Ryouga."</p><p>"What the hell do you mean by that?"</p><p>"I mean, you did it first. I got the  idea from you."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Why did you offer to be a girl for  me, Ryouga?"</p><p>"'Cuz I thought that's what you  wanted, needed, from me!"</p><p>"Yeah. Exactly."</p><p>Ryouga stared at him. Standing up  and leaning over, "But! Are you insane! When Ukyo and Akane talk about doing  that for you, you… all of you, flip out!"</p><p>Ranma deflated. Looking up at  Ryouga, he sighed, "I know, that makes me a hypocrite. What can I do? I'm  already messed up, I've already been through hell with this, and I can't go  back to what I was. I really don't want either of them making the same  mistakes, going through the same hell, as me. And it never ends. I thought I  was doing this for Akane, but…"</p><p>"Doing it only hurt her," Ranko  stated in a small voice.</p>
