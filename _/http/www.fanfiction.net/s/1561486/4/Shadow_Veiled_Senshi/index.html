</div>Shadow Veiled Senshi<p>(Ranma/Sailor Moon X-over)<p>By Shad4c<p>Disclaimer: Ranma and Sailor Moon belongs to other people. Not me. This is purely done for entertainment purposes and no profit is made from it in any form.<p>You can find my fics at:-<p>Lady Cosmos Fanfic Library - .com/<p>Nighthawks Fanfiction - .com/<p>and<p>Ranchan Totally Crossed Out - .com/<p>Chapter 3<p>Unravelling Visions<p>Ranma slowly rose in the early morning and started on his morning routine. Get up, get dressed, warm up with a couple of kata to wake up fully and then stuff himself with whatever he could find. Such is the life of a Saotome. So far he had reached the 3rd stage of this 4 stage process, but now his mind roamed backwards towards last night, slowing his kata.<p>Why was it that he could never have NICE, quiet, normal dreams like everyone else had. It was always nightmares of sometype or another, ever since he'd gotten to Nerima...well ever since the Cat Fist actually but while living at the Tendos they had diversified. This was the last thing he needed, Tokyo in flames, a classic evil villain laugh 101 in the background(slightly different from the crazed martial artist laugh 101 he was used to hearing) and a couple of girls in fukus. He'd came here to sort things out...wait...those fukus looked a little familiar...I wonder...<p>GROWL!<p>Ranma's stomach protested the interruption in the normal flow of things in the only way it  brought his mind back to the important things for a Saotome (i.e. eating) and he proceeded to set about dealing with it. Strange dreams could wait no matter how real they seemed.<p>At the same time over in a certain temple in Juuban, Rei Hino, shrine priestess and Sailor Mars, sprung awake at the end of the dream. She pulled herself out of bed and dressed quickly. She shivered slightly despite the warmth of her bedroom, she was thinking back to the dream, the vision really for that was what it had felt like. She sat down heavily on her bed, the emotional weight bearing down on her overwhelming, for a moment.<p>It was meant to be over, the enemies, the youma, the battles...all of that was to have ended with Galaxia. With that Rei squared her shoulders as her fiery spirit roared back up from despair, they were the Sailor Senshi, champions of love and justice, they'd fought and won in the past and they would so so again. With a determined frown she reached for her senshi communicator to call the others for a meeting.<p>"Meatball Head better not be late this time". muttered Rei, as she used the communicator to call her princess.<p>At the Gates of Time Sailor Pluto is already scanning for the enemy she never predicted. Nothing could be allowed to threaten Crystal Tokyo thought the Senshi of Pluto grimly as she scanned even harder.<p>About midday the Senshi, both Inners and Outers, were assembled together at Rei' Shrine. They seated themselves in a rough circle around the room, lounging on the various chairs. So far nothing had been done as Ami and Hotaru read, Luna and Artemis lay on the table watching Rei, Minako and Makato chatted, Haruka and Michiru snuggled and Usagi read Rei' Manga. Rei surveyed the group that had assembled together and decided it was time to start the meeting with or without Setsuna. Besides if she didn't then Usagi would probably decide to take that manga home and she hadn't even read it yet!<p>"Ahem!" Rei loudly cleared her throat gaining the attention of all the senshi, even Usagi after a good long glare at the blond haired girl that had her scrambling to attention.<p>"Now, I called you all here since I had a vision last night" Rei prepared to continue then only to be interrupted by Haruka.<p>"What you saw the face of your next boyfriend" she smiled at her joke. Rei glared back at her.<p>"No...I saw Tokyo in flames...bodies everywhere...a horrible laugh floating in the air". Rei shut her eyes as she forced herself to remember. The pain in her voice sobered Haruka and the others, causing Usagi to get up and put an arm around the raven haired senshi for comfort.<p>All the senshi turned their minds inwards as they faced up to the fact that the battles they had thought finished had started again. Silence reigned for several minutes before Luna spoke up again in a quiet tone.<p>" Rei is their anything else you can remember about this vision, anything at all".<p>The Inner Senshi looked appalled at this while the outers listened harder as Rei pulled herself together, smiling gratefully at Usagi. She took a deep breath before continuing.<p>" Only one thing" Rei started, the others crowded closer " I..I wasn't alone. I don't know who else was there, all I saw of them we're colours. One was white, green and black, the other was white, black and silver. I didn't see anything else but...I sensed they were seeing the vision like I was, that they were not part of it".<p>As she finished, Rei looked apologetically around at the other senshi, receiving smiles in reply.<p>"Well there's not much we can do at the moment except wait and prepare ourselves. You girls had best go home and do anything you need too. I have a feeling that we're going to be pretty busy in the near future". Artemis spoke with confidence as he strolled over to Minako and allowed her to pick him up as the senshi rose and followed his advice.<p>As Rei sat in the empty room she wondered to herself, where was Setsuna...and who were the other two watchers. She then stood and went about her duties for the day with a grimmer air about her then she'd had lately.<p>As the Senshi were filing out of the meeting with new worries on their mind, Ranma had finish practising in normal form for the day, having spent all morning in it and was about to try out his new powers again. He called on the powers with the battlecry...<p>"NEMESIS CRYSTAL POWER".<p>...Triggering his transformation into Sailor Nemesis. She stood there for a moment, eyes closed. With the transformation came not only the power but a slightly greater clarity of mind, with this clarity the dream of the night before, returned to haunt her.<p>Its vividness, the raw sense of evil and danger, it was so strong that she could almost taste it. Whatever it was, she would probably have to deal with it when it came, the thing that caught most of her attention was the others in the dream...the others watching what she was.<p>Who were they?<p>What were they doing in her dream?<p>The flashes of red, white, green and black she'd caught before the dream stopped didn't give her much to go on.<p>Ah, well knowing her luck she'd find out sooner then she wanted to anyway so no point worrying about it. Better to test out her new abilitys more.<p>She walked up to a huge nearby boulder and punched it as hard as she could, totally destroying it with the force of the blow. She blinked and looked at her hand for a moment stunned, even Ryoga couldn't have done that without the Bakusai Tenketsu. She then took a stance and punched as fast as she could, a small sonic boom rocked the area as her fist completely shattered the sound barrier. The local wildlife scattered at this while Nemesis was unaffected by the noise. She opened her fist and stared at it again. The Old Ghoul would totally freak. Thought Nemesis, NOTHING was that fast without using ki to boost their movements. Heh, an image of Nemesis challenging Cologne to a Chestnut Fist duel with her enhanced speed flashed through her mind, that would show her. Then a flash behind her eyes sent her back into her memories.<p>I'm running through the latest of the techniques that my Sensei, the Elder Nemesis, has shown me while said person looked on. The holo-training room is set to neutral so nothing but gray walls and sparkling energy crystals can be seen, barr the large control panel by the doorway.<p>As I finish the technique and turn to my Sensei she nods and strides, for she moved to purposely for it to be called walking, over to the control panel. Once there she hits a button and a large metal rectangle with handholds appeared. She then hit another button on the console and my own weight pressed me down, she must have increased the gravity in the room. She nods towards the block.<p>"Pick it up"<p>I look at her and then back at the block before stepping forward and crouching down to grip the block. Once I had a good hold I lifted with all my might, which because of my training is considerable. Even so I only JUST managed to lift it before being forced to drop it again. Almost crushing my foot in the process!<p>Looking back at Elder Nemesis I saw her nod and gesture at the block again.<p>"Now transform and lift it"<p>I blinked at that and did as she told me, chanting my transformation phrase and becoming Younger Sailor Nemesis. I then went back to the block and lifted it with ease before putting it back down.<p>Feeling like an idiot for not doing this before I again turned back to my sensei. She was smiling sympathetically.<p>"Why didn't I tell you to do that the first time? It was easy in Senshi form wasn't it". She spoke softly, watching as I nod. "I did that for a reason, the senshi form doesn't give you any extra speed or strength despite popular belief. What it does is multiply your existing levels of speed, strength and endurance. If you could lift that in normal form then you wouldn't even feel it as a Senshi".<p>She watched as I took this in before continuing.<p>"Since your in Senshi form..."<p>Nemesis blinked as she returned to reality before smirking and getting back to testing the limits of her physical abilitys.<p>8 Hours Later<p>After a grawling 8 hours of training Nemesis felt like she had a fairly good idea of where she was at physically. Now for the next stage.<p>She dropped into a defensive stance and reached inside of herself for her power. During the battle with Saffron she had tapped it, and levelled a good strip of land along with Saffron in the process. She was hoping for something a little less destructive this time so she drew on the smallest amount of power she could, feeling it rise up and take form into what she somehow knew to be her weakest attack.<p>Arms moving of their own accord her hands balled into fists, index and little finger pointing out. Her right hand came up parallel to her face on its left-hand side while her left hand was held in front of her right elbow, fingers pointed off to her side. She then snapped her right arm forward so it was pointing at her target while quickly pulling her left arm diagonally back across her body. As this happened she released her attack at a boulder with the cry of.<p>"DARK DRAGON LIGHTNING!"<p>A mass of black lightning shot forward and smashed into the rock, breaking it up and scorching the pieces.<p>Well it was a little better thought Ranma, still have to work on my control though. Thinking about the attack an errant thought summoned the Void Lance into her hand, as it caught her eye it triggered another flashback.<p>I stand in a small clearing in one of Earths Great Forests watching as my Sensei casts her basic Senshi attack, the Dark Dragon Lightning. I watch as it breaks and scorches rocks in the area. Elder Nemesis then speaks to me.<p>"It's time you see another of the Void Lances powers" she spoke, summoning the Talisman before setting up for another Dark Dragon Lightning. "It can act as a lens, enhancing the power of any of our attacks".<p>She then unleashed a Dark Dragon Lightning through the Void Lance. Instead of breaking and scorching the rock it vaporised it before my eyes. As I gawked my Sensei turned and stared grimly at me.<p>"Such is our power"<p>Nemesis shook her head before glancing at the Talisman in her hand and repeating the movements of the Elder Nemesis from her memories. A massive amount of black lightning shot from the horizontally held blades of the Talisman before vaporising an innocent rock.<p>Exhaling slowly Nemesis glanced down at the weapon with new respect before deciding to call it a day, de-transforming Ranma went for something to eat.<p>GROWL!<p>A Saotomes stomach is never satisfied.<p>Elsewhere a blond haired man stands in a darkened room with a glowing ball infront of him, slowly collecting the scraps of power leftover from his deceased mistress. Meanwhile, a green haired Senshi continued to scan for a threat she never foresaw, determined to stop it.<p>Authors Note<p>Well this is chapter 3 I hope you liked it, by the way thanks for the e-mails, keep them coming! I know I said there would be action but it just doesn't fit in with the story yet. The training room is a cross between DBZ's gravity room and Star Treks holodecks. See you next chapter!<p>I'd like to thank my pre-readers:-<p>Goku Goku<p>Gerold Jordan<p>Staumkinar 'Puck' Silverbreeze<p>(Priest of The Church of Time and Chaos)<p>Please send constructive comments (Flames will be used to heat my room) to .
