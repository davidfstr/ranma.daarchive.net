</div>Ranma Onehalf: First steps, Book two.<p>Chapter two.<p>Ranma stepped into the Third Base Bar and headed to a booth in the back. Sitting down in the booth Ranma looked up as a waitress came over with a glass of orange juice.<p>"Hi Lee-chan." Ranma said as she came up.<p>"Hi Ranma." Lee-chan said as she put Ranmas drink in front of her. "Akane will over in a second." she said.<p>"Thanks." Ranma said with a nod.<p>Sitting there Ranma sipped her juice and glanced around the bar.<p>"I can't believe it's been a year already." she thought.<p>As she looked around she saw Akane step out of the stockroom with a case of liquor and set it down behind the bar. Standing up he turned around and walked over the table.<p>"Hi Ranma." Akane said as he sat down. "What brings you over here?" he asked.<p>Ranma smiled. "I thought I'd catch you on your lunch break." she said. "And I have a surprise for you." she added as she reached into her back pack and took out a box.<p>"Oh, you brought lunch." he said.<p>Ranma nodded. "That's part of it." she said. Reaching into the front pocket of the pack she took out a slip of paper. "Here's the other part." she said.<p>"What is it?" Akane asked as he took the paper.<p>"Our dojo's sign." Ranma said as Akane opened it up.<p>"Wow." Akane said as he looked at it.<p>Akane was stunned, to put it simply. It was a simple sign, with no fancy decorations or such. What made it so stunning was the calligraphy. It was absolutely flawless with no mistakes and a distinct flowing style.<p>"Who did this?" Akane asked.<p>"Matoko." Ranma said as she opened her dinner.<p>Akanes eyebrows shot up and she looked at Ranma. "Matoko did this?" he asked.<p>Ranma nodded. "Yep. She said that she heard us arguing about it and that inspired her to do it." she said.<p>Akane whistled as she looked at the paper again. "That girl has talent." Akane said as he folded it back up and handed it to Ranma.<p>"That's what I said." Ranma told him. "She was too modest about it though. But I think Lia is getting her to come out of her shell." she added.<p>Akane nodded as he opened his lunch. "Yeah, I've noticed that too. And I've noticed that Matoko is helping Lia get used to Japan." he said.<p>"I noticed that too." Ranma said. "So you want to use that as our sign?" she asked.<p>Akane nodded. "Yeah, it's perfect." he said. "I can't wait until we finally open." he said.<p>"Me too, Akane. Me too." Ranma agreed. "Now lets eat, the foods getting cold." she said, picking up her chopsticks.<p>After finishing eating with Akane Ranma headed home. Walking along the quiet streets she enjoyed the warm weather as she walked. Reaching the house Ranma hopped the fence rather than use the gate.<p>Easily she leaped to the second story and opened the guests room window and paused to take her shoes off before slipping inside. Quietly she changed into her pjs (tank top and boxers) and padded down the hall to check on Lia before turning in.<p>Cracking open the door Ranma peered in and saw with his Neko -ken enhanced vision that the lump on the futon was larger than normal. Curious she padded over to the futon and leaned in to check.<p>She was surprised to find Lia and Matoko both under the covers, spooning. Ranma was curious as to why Matoko was sleeping over but wasn't going to wake them up to ask. Leaning back she glanced at the foot of the bed and saw Thor looking at her from his normal position at the foot of the bed.<p>Ranma pointed at the girls and gave Thor a questioning look. He merely blinked at her and went back to sleep. Shrugging Ranma got up and left the room. Picking up her shoes Ranma headed downstairs to put them in the mud room and get some hot water to change.<p>Reaching the foot of the stairs she was surprised to find Ono sitting at the table having a late night snack. Ono blinked in surprise as he looked up at Ranma.<p>"Hello Ranma. I didn't know that you had gotten home yet." he said.<p>"Yeah. I brought Akane lunch and I used the other door to get in." she said as she walked to the mud room.<p>After putting her shoes away Ranma walked into the kitchen and ran the hot water for a minute. Sticking her hand under it Ranma changed back into his normal form. After turning off the water he grabbed himself a snack before heading back into the dining room.<p>Sitting down Ranma glanced up at Ono. "I noticed that Matoko is sleeping over." he said.<p>Ono nodded. "I know. Izu, Lia, and Matoko had a study session that ran late." he said. "I called Matokos mother and got her permission rather than have Matoko walk home." he said.<p>"Okay." Ranma said, satisfied with Onos explanation.<p>The two men ate their snacks in silence before retiring to their beds for the evening.<p>The sun rose over the city of Nerima and shone down on the houses there. As it climbed higher in the sky the shadows shortened. In the guestroom at the Tendo home the light came in through the window and tracked its way down the wall and across the floor.<p>Gradually the light fell on Ranma Saotome and brought him back to conciseness. Feeling the warmth of the sun seeing the light through his eyelids Ranma became aware of a soft, warm, body pressing into his front.<p>Cracking open his eyes Ranma saw that Akane was lying pressed up against him and he was partially curled up around her. He lay there and just enjoyed the feeling of Akane lying against him.<p>After several minutes with great reluctance Ranma extracted himself and got up. Silently he padded outside and shut the door behind him. Hearing a door open down the hall Ranma looked and saw Matoko and Lia coming out of Lias room.<p>"Good morning girls." Ranma said as he stepped aside to allow them to pass.<p>"Morning Daddy." Lia said.<p>"Good morning Mr. Saotome." Matoko said.<p>"Did you sleep well?" Ranma asked as he fell in behind them.<p>"Yeah. Like a log." Lia said while Matoko nodded. "Good." Ranma said. "And by the way, Akanes PJs look good on you Matoko." he added.<p>Matoko looked back at Ranma. "Thank you Mr. Saotome." she said. "Though they are short in the legs though." she added, pointing.<p>"True." Ranma observed. "By the way, I have a question for you two." he said as they reached the foot of the stairs.<p>"Yeah?" Lia asked.<p>Kneeling down Ranma got on their level. "Our anniversary is coming up and I was wondering if you two would like to help out with a surprise gift for Akane." he said. When they both nodded yes he continued. "Matoko, you know that sign that you drew up?" he asked.<p>"Yes..." Matoko said with a slight nod.<p>"If I build the sign, would you two like to paint it?" he asked.<p>"I'd love to." Matoko said while Lia nodded enthusiastically.<p>"Good." Ranma said. "Now lets keep this secret, okay?" he continued, leaning in close.<p>"Okay." the girls chorused.<p>Ranma stood up as Matoko looked at Lia.<p>"Lets go get washed, I want to get started on the sign." she said.<p>"Okay." Lia answered.<p>As the two girls dashed off to the furo Ranma chuckled to himself, remembering that a year ago Lia would have freaked about sharing a bath. Akane and Kasumi had helped her get over that, after showing how nice it was to have someone scrub your back.<p>Ranma yawned and headed into the kitchen to get some breakfast.<p>A few minutes later in the furo Lia was working up a lather as she sat on her stool. Next to her Matoko upended a wash bucket over herself.<p>"Brrr! Cold!" she said. "I wonder how surprised your parents are going to be when they their other surprise present." she said.<p>"I don't know, but I cant wait to find out." Lia said with a giggle.<p>"Here, I'll scrub your back." Matoko said as she turned to Lia. "Thanks." Lia said.<p>Over the next week Ranma was able to put the sign together with a minimum of difficulty. Keeping it hidden from Akane was fairly easy with their differing schedules and Matokos idea to hide it at the clinic.<p>Lia suggested the idea of using a school project to explain their being at the clinic after school. They had the sign finished the day before Ranma and Akanes anniversary.<p>Akane called in sick that day and met Ranma after work in her unburied form. Ranma stepped out of the employee entrance and spotted Akane. Waving she headed over.<p>"Hi Akane. You ready?" Ranma asked as she came up.<p>Akane nodded. "Uh -huh." she said.<p>"Okay. I just need to do a quick change of clothes..." Ranma said, hefting her backpack for emphasis "...and I'll be ready." she finished.<p>Heading down the street, Ranma ducked into an alley and used the Umi -Sen -Ken before slipping into a nearby public restroom. Ten minutes later Ranma emerged from the mens room male and dressed in a blue Chinese robe with tiger embroidery and black kung -fu pants, which matched Akanes red robe with dragon embroidery and black kung -fu pants.<p>Hand in hand, they began to walk down the street. As they walked along they took in the sights and sounds of the local nightlife while also keeping an eye out for puddles and other sources of water.<p>"So, Ranma, where are we headed?" Akane asked<p>"A little restaurant that your father and Ono told me about." Ranma said.<p>"Oh?" Akane asked, curious.<p>"Yeah. Apparently that's where your father took your mother when they were dating, Ono took Kasumi there as well." he answered. "They said that it has great food, good atmosphere, and I figured that since they went there I had to keep the tradition alive." Ranma added with a wink.<p>Akane gave Ranma a sly look. "Ranma Saotome, following tradition. Now I've seen everything." she quipped.<p>Ranma shrugged. "Well, since the only tradition in the Saotome clan is being an idiot, so I figured that I'd add some new ones." he said. Akane giggled and leaned in close.<p>"I don't know, I've found I have a thing for bakas." she said.<p>"Well, I have a thing for tomboys you know." Ranma replied with a slight smile.<p>"Tell me about it." Akane answered back.<p>Turning the corner Ranma pointed to a small wooden sign lost in the clutter of the neon.<p>"There we are." he said.<p>Akane squinted as she read the sign. "Satos?" she said as she read the sign aloud. "It doesn't look like much." she said as she glanced at Ranma.<p>Ranma shrugged. "Well, your father and Ono spoke highly of it." he said. Opening the door he stood aside for Akane to pass. "Lets see if they're right about it." he said.<p>"By all means." Akane said as she entered.<p>As the door closed behind them an older man came out from the back and hurried over.<p>"Mr Saotome, welcome to Satos." the man said as he bowed to Ranma.<p>"Thank you Mr Sato." Ranma said as he returned the bow. Straiten up he pointed to Akane. "Mr Sato, I'd like to introduce you to my wife Akane." he said.<p>Mr Satos face brightened as he turned to Akane and got a good look at her. "Ah, Mrs Saotome, its good to meet you. You look almost exactly like your mother." he said as he bowed to her.<p>"T-thank you Mr Sato." Akane said as she returned the bow.<p>"Your welcome." Mr Sato replied. Gesturing he led them to the back of the restaurant. "Come, your table is waiting." he said.<p>As they threaded their way to the back Ranma and Akane took in the decor of the restaurant, which had a distinct Western appearance with tables and chairs. But it also had a Japanese flavor as well, with lots of wood and laquer throughout.<p>Reaching their table they sat down and Mr Sato hurried off to get their menus.<p>"Well." Ranma said.<p>"Well." Akane echoed.<p>"It's been nine years." he said.<p>"Uh -huh." Akane said with a nod. "It doesn't seem like it's been that long, hasn't it?" she said.<p>"Yeah." Ranma agreed. "Time has just flown by. It seems like it was only yesterday that Lia was born." he said.<p>Akane nodded. Anything more was prevented by the arrival of Mr Sato with their menus. Presenting them with their menus Mr Sato bowed to them.<p>"Would you like to have something to drink while you decide?" he asked.<p>"Uh, yeah. I'd like to have some tea and..." he said as he glanced at Akane.<p>"I'd like some tea as well." Akane said.<p>"Certainly." Mr Sato said.<p>As Mr Sato went to get their tea Ranma chuckled slightly.<p>"Whats so funny?" Akane asked.<p>"I just realized that nothing strange has happened yet." he said.<p>Akane blinked in surprise. "Huh, you're right Ranma." she said. "And our parents haven't tried anything either." she added.<p>At the Tendos a trio of sneezes rang out.<p>"Oh, that I can explain." Ranma said. "I asked Kasumi to run interference tonight." he explained.<p>"Ah." Akane said as Mr Sato came back with their tea.<p>"Are you ready to order?" Mr Sato asked.<p>"Ah, yes actually." Ranma said.<p>"Excellent." Mr Sato said as he took out a notepad.<p>A lone dog barked as Ranma and Akane walked home from the restaurant. Walking along they enjoyed the warm summer air and the quiet streets. They didn't talk, just held hands and enjoyed the simple pleasure of each others company.<p>Entering the gate they saw that the lights were out in the house.<p>"Huh. Everyone must've gone to bed already." Ranma said as they walked up to the house.<p>"It can't be that late." Akane said as she looked at her watch. "It's only... 11 o'clock?" she said as she read the time.<p>"Looks like presents will have to wait until tomorrow." Ranma said.<p>"Oh well." Akane sighed as Ranma opened the door.<p>After removing their shoes in the mud room they silently padded into the house. Approaching the dining room Ranma could have sworn he heard movement. Shrugging his suspicions off he slid the door open and he and Akane stepped through.<p>"SURPRISE!"<p>Ranma and Akane had barely taken three steps into the room when the lights flicked on and revealed the whole family, both Tendo and Saotome and Matoko as well.<p>"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!" they yelled.<p>Ranma and Akane staggered back in surprise as streamers popped and confetti rained down. Lia and Matoko came forward and dragged Ranma and Akane to the table.<p>"C'mon. It's time to open your presents!" Lis said as she dragged her father over.<p>"O-Okay! Okay" Ranma said as he sat down at the table, which was piled high with gifts.<p>Sitting there they looked at the pile of gifts in front of them with awe as the family sat down at the table.<p>"Which one do we open first?" Akane asked.<p>"How about ours, dear?" Nodoka asked, leaning forward with an envelope.<p>"Okay." Ranma said as he took the envelope from his mother. Opening it he took out a thick bundle of paper. "What the-?" he asked.<p>Setting it down on the table Ranma and Akane looked at it as he opened it up. It contained a pair of two way train tickets and a key.<p>"Train tickets?"Akane asked.<p>"And a key?" Ranma added. Nodoka and Genma smiled at their son and daughter in law.<p>"We decided that since that you never had a honeymoon that we give you one." Genma said.<p>Nodoka nodded. "Those tickets will take you a little village in the mountains where we spent our honeymoon and they key is to a cottage we rented for you." she said.<p>"Thank you." Ranma and Akane echoed.<p>Seeing an official -looking document under the tickets Akane pulled it out.<p>"Whats this?" she asked.<p>"Oh, just a little something that your sisters and I thought you'd like to have." Soun said as she read it.<p>"This document states that this building is the property of Ranma and Akane Saotome..." she read to her self.<p>Wide eyed Akane looked up at her father.<p>"This is the title to the house!" she exclaimed.<p>Solemnly her father nodded. "Yes. I decided that since you were opening your own dojo that I would give you the house." he said.<p>"But what about you..?" Akane asked.<p>Soun laughed and waved his hand. "I'll be alright. Ono and Kasumi are buying their own house and they've agreed to let me move in with them." he said. Sighing he continued. "And truth be told, the master bedroom is far too empty for one man." he said.<p>"And don't worry about the inheritance taxes either." Nabiki joined in. "I managed to find a few legal loopholes around them." she said.<p>Akane blinked in surprise. "How?" she asked.<p>Nabiki shrugged. "We sold it to you." she said.<p>"For how much?" Ranma asked.<p>Soun reached into his pocket and pulled out a shiny gold coin. "For one dollar, US." he said.<p>Akane both blinked in surprise.<p>"Where did you get a Sacajewea dollar?" Ranma asked. "And how did we sign the paperwork?" he added.<p>A muffled giggle on his right clued him in on one of the parties involved. He glanced out the corner of his eye at Lia, who was doing her patented 'I'm so cute I cant possibly be guilty' poses.<p>"You mean all those last minute school forms you forgot about until Monday morning was actually the paperwork for the house?" he asked.<p>Lia turned up the cuteness another notch.<p>"You sneaky little devil, you...!" Akane added.<p>Lia couldn't take it anymore and fell backwards laughing. Akane looked at Ranma.<p>"She gets this from you." she said.<p>"Tell me about it." Ranma said as he looked at his daughter, who was rolling around on the floor laughing her head off.<p>"And whats your present?" Ranma asked Nabiki.<p>Nabiki smiled and held out her hands. "I'll be your book keeper for the dojo." she said.<p>"And I shall teach you the Kuno school of Kendo, if you wish." Tatewaki added.<p>"And I've included my recipe books..." Kasumi began.<p>"Along with my manuals on pressure points and chi techniques." Ono finished.<p>"Thank you." Akane said with a bow.<p>Ranma glanced over at Matoko and Lia, who had sat back up but was still giggling like a hyena.<p>"Don't you two have a present?" he asked.<p>Matokos eyes went wide as she 'eeped' as she and Lia jumped to their feet.<p>"Where are they going?" Akane asked as they dashed out of the room.<p>"Oh, their getting a little surprise we thought up." Ranma answered.<p>The girls returned a few moments later with a large cloth wrapped bundle. Standing where everyone could see Matoko and Lia began to unwrap it.<p>"Here's our present."Lia said as the cloth fell away. "A dojo sign for the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts." she said.<p>She and Matoko stood there for several moments holding the sign. Noting the odd looks Matoko glanced at the sign and saw that they were holding it upside down. Seeing Matoko looking at the sign Lia took a look.<p>Smiling sheepishly they flipped the sign over right side up.<p>"Sorry." Lia said.<p>"It's okay." Akane said. "I like it." she said with a nod of approval.<p>Leaning the sign against the wall Lia and Matoko sat down at the table as Ranma and Akane finished opening their presents.<p>"So who thought this up?" Ranma asked as he opened a box.<p>"I did." Soun said. "Over a year ago. I originally thought I'd just surprise you with the house." he continued.<p>"And the rest of this?" Ranma asked, waving at the gifts for emphasis.<p>"Well, I asked Nabiki for help with the house..." Soun began.<p>"And it kind of snowballed from there." Nabiki said with a shrug.<p>"Oi." Ranma said as he dropped his head on the table.<p>Everybody chuckled as Kasumi came in with cake.<p>End.<p>As an honorary Saotome.
