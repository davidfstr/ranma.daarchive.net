</div>Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Two.<p>Chapter Six.<p>Nerima- June 8. Nerima Times.<p>Today the police announced they have determined that the events surrounding Ms. Tanaka Kosoru were the results of an accidental overdose of painkillers. Police based their decision on the fact that Ms. Tanaka had been drinking the night of April tenth and had apparently misread the label along with the lack of a suicide note.<p>Unfortunately the accident left Ms. Tanaka brain damaged. Doctors at Nerima General Hospital said the brain damage occurred when Ms. Tanaka was being transported to the hospital and her heart stopped. She was immediately resuscitated but apparently not in time. Ms. Tanaka is survived by her daughter Matoko. - Kuoanu Akai.<p>Matoko sighed to herself as she folded the paper and put it down.<p>"That was very discreet of them." Matoko thought as she put the paper down. "No mention of the truth at all." she added.<p>Shaking her head Matoko broke off that train of thought for down that path was only darkness. For better of for worse her life had changed radically and dwelling on the past would do her no good.<p>"The woman known as Tanaka Kosoru died two months ago." Matoko told herself. "All that's left is a shell without a ghost." she thought.<p>The doctors at the hospital had told her that normally when a persons heart stops and is immediately revived there is almost never brain damage. However her mother had a massive amount of painkillers and alcohol in her system and those, combined with the lack of oxygen to her brain while her heart was stopped had did it.<p>So for all intents and purposes Tanaka Kosoru was dead. It had taken all of Matokos will power not to break down then and there. Instead she had forced back the tears and hugged her mother and told her goodbye.<p>And now...<p>"And now I have a new family and a new life. I can't go to the way things were, no matter how much I want to." Matoko thought. "All I can do is go forward."<p>A knock at the door snapped Matoko back to reality.<p>"Who is it?" she asked.<p>"Lia." her sister said as she opened the door and stuck her head in. "It's our turn to give Christian his bath." she added.<p>"Isn't it kind of early?" Matoko asked, looking up at the clock which read five pm.<p>"We have to catch him first, remember?" Lia pointed out.<p>"Oh, yes, that's right." Matoko said as she got up. "So where do we start?" she asked.<p>"Well, I was thinking we check the yard first and work our way in. Dad has the roof." Lia said as Matoko stepped.<p>"That sounds like a plan." Matoko said as she closed her bedroom door behind her.<p>It took them forty five minutes to locate their little brother in his hiding place and several laps around the yard and through the house before they were able to catch him. By that time they both needed a bath themselves.<p>"Honestly Christian, it's like you're gonna dissolve or something." Lia said as she carried her struggling brother inside the house.<p>"No!" Christian shrieked as he clamped onto the furo's doorframe.<p>"Christian, quit being so stubborn!" Lia said as she tried to pull him loose. "You're all dirty! You gotta take a bath!" she continued.<p>"Nooo! I don't wanna take a bath!" Christian shrieked as he clamped down harder.<p>"Matoko..." Lia asked.<p>"I got it." Matoko answered.<p>Stepping forward Matoko carefully pried Christians hands loose from the doorframe. Lia immediately stepped back and planted her brother on the floor. Matoko stepped in after them and shut the door behind her.<p>"Now, are you going to cooperate or are you gonna be stubborn?" Lia asked as she looked down at him.<p>"No!" he answered with a pout.<p>Lia rolled her eyes and shook her head. "Oh brother..." she sighed. "I got the top, you got the bottom." Lia said as she bent down. After a few more minutes of struggling they had Christian ready for the bath. Lia kept an eye on Christian while Matoko got ready and then she did the same for Lia.<p>"Let's go Christian." Lia said, nudging her brother with her foot.<p>"No!" he said defiantly.<p>"Arrrgh..." Lia groaned as she picked up her brother.<p>Stepping inside the furo Lia planted her little brother on his stool and held onto him as Matoko entered behind them and shut the door. Lia waited until Matoko had knelt down and planted herself in front of the door before she released him.<p>Seeing that his way out was blocked Christian simply crossed his arms and pouted. Lia filled a rinse bucket with water and then dumped it over his head.<p>"AAAH! THAT'S COLD!" he shrieked as the water hit him.<p>"Christian, whats so bad about taking a bath? Matoko and I take them all the time and we don't fight about it." Lia said as her brother gave her a glare.<p>"Baths are for sissies." her brother groused.<p>"Really?" Lia asked as she pumped soap onto a sponge. "Dad takes baths, so does that make him a sissy?" she asked.<p>"..." was Christians reply.<p>"Thought so." Lia said. "Here. Now scrub." she said, handing him the sponge.<p>Christian gave his sister another glare before scrubbing himself down. After reminding him to scrub the places he missed Lia pronounced him clean and gave him a good rinsing.<p>"You wanna soak in the tub?" Lia asked as her brother shook the water off.<p>"No!" he answered.<p>"Okay then. Go dry off. There are clean clothes on top of your towel." Lia said as she pointed to the door.<p>Matoko stepped aside as Christian stomped out of the furo and slammed the inner door behind him. Getting out her bath stool and her bathing supplies Matoko sat down next to Lia.<p>"That went well." she observed as she filled her pail.<p>"Yeah. Normally one of us has to hold him while the other scrubs." Lia said as she dumped her pail over her head. "I guess he must be warming up to the idea." she added.<p>"Or it may be because we're his sisters." Matoko pointed out before she upended her pail over her head. "Brrr! Cold" she said.<p>"Could be." Lia said as she began to work up a lather. "Could you scrub my back for me?" she asked.<p>"Sure." Matoko said as she picked up a sponge.<p>As Matoko began to scrub Lia arched her back and let out a purr. Matoko, now used to such behavior, kept scrubbing. When she was finished she turned around and let Lia scrub her back.<p>After they had washed off the days accumulation and rinsed both girls settled into the tub for a long and well deserved soak. Saying silent both girls lay back in the tub and simply enjoyed the hot water.<p>Head resting on the edge of the tub Matoko began to review the days events. This was a ritual she had been doing for as long as she could remember and it was how she wound down before bed. As she performed her daily review the newspaper article she had read loomed large in her mind.<p>"Lia..."she began as she adjusted her position "The police ruled what happened to my mother an accident." she continued.<p>"Oh?" Lia asked as she opened one eye and looked at her sister. "And how do you feel about that?" she asked.<p>Matoko sighed as she sank into the water. "I'm glad actually." she answered.<p>"How come?" Lia asked as she opened both eyes and turned her head to look at her sister.<p>"She has been through enough already. I don't want her name tarnished as well." Matoko told her.<p>"Oh." Lia said.<p>Lia was silent for a few moments before she opened her eyes and looked at Matoko.<p>"Matoko, why did the police rule it an accident?" she asked.<p>"No suicide note." Matoko answered.<p>"But there is one." Lia said.<p>Matoko nodded slightly. "Yes. In her diary, addressed to me." she said. "She gave up." Matoko continued.<p>"Oh." Lia said. "How do you feel about that?" Lia asked.<p>"I love her Lia, and nothing will ever change that. Mama did the best she possibly could." Matoko told her. "And I'm a Saotome now, not Tanaka." she added.<p>Lia glanced at her sister. "You're leaving you're past behind?" she asked.<p>Matoko shook her head slightly. "No. I learned a long time ago you cannot change your past, but you can shape your future." she said. "My past will always be a part of me Lia, but I'm focusing on now and the future."<p>"Okay." Lia said with a nod. "And speaking of now, the waters getting cold." she added as she sat up.<p>"You're right." Matoko said as she got up.<p>Ranma jumped as Akanes kick passed below him. Faster than the eye could follow Ranma counter with a five kick combo that Akane blocked. As he landed Ranma sidestepped Akanes counter attack and hopped backwards out of range.<p>"I was thinking..." Akane began as they circled each other.<p>"About what?" Ranma asked.<p>"Lia." Akane answered as Ranma renewed his attack.<p>"What about her?" Ranma asked as he began his Chestnut Fist.<p>"I thinks she's coming down with something."Akane answered as she began to parry as much of Ranmas strikes as she could.<p>"What gives you that idea?" Ranma asked as Akane broke his attack with a sweeper kick that he jumped over.<p>This time Akane hopped backwards out of range. Circling each other they waited for the other to present an opening.<p>"Well, she's been moody lately and she hasn't been eating." Akane said.<p>Ranma frowned. "That is odd. There is a bug going around." he said. "She may have caught it." he added.<p>Akane grimaced. "Ye gods, I hope not." she said. "Lias worse than you when it comes to admitting weakness." she added.<p>Ranma quirked an eyebrow at Akane. "Are you saying I'm stubborn?" he asked.<p>"No, I'm saying that compared to you a brick wall would be agreeable." Akane shot back.<p>"You're one to talk." Ranma answered. "It took me seven years for me to get you to marry me." he added.<p>"That's because I knocked you up, you baka!" Akane replied.<p>"Tomboy." Ranma answered as he stuck out his tongue.<p>"That's it! You asked for it!" Akane yelled as she summoned her mallet from Hammerspace.<p>Charging forward Akane swung at Ranma only to have him disappear and her mallet hit empty air.<p>"What the-?" was all Akane got out before her feet were swept out from under her.<p>Before Akane knew what was happening she was falling backwards, only to stop short before she hit the floor and Ranma appeared above her.<p>"Ranma, what are doing -Mmmmm!" she began, but was cut off when Ranma kissed her.<p>After performing a few of the more advanced forms of the Saotome Kissing Techniques Ranma broke off the kiss and came up for air.<p>"Oh, just something I picked up from read some of Pops scrolls." he sais nonchalantly.<p>"Are there any more?" Akane asked as she grabbed the front of Ranmas shirt.<p>"Oh yeah. Lots more." he said with a grin.<p>"Show me." Akane said as she pulled him to her.<p>Ranma was about to begin a particular complex combo when he was interupted by Matoko clearing her throat.<p>"Ah, yes Matoko?" Ranma asked as he looked up at her.<p>"I'm sorry to intrude, but we have an emergency." she said, looking at the floor in front of her feet.<p>"What is it?" Ranma asked as he and Akane untangled themselves.<p>Matoko blushed a deep red and looked at the floor. "Ahhh...I uhh...it's kind of personal." she said in a small voice.<p>"You can tell us Matoko. No need to be embarrassed." Akane said softly.<p>Swallowing nervously Matoko continued. "Well, it's not me, it's Lia." she began. "She's in the bathroom and she's , well she's,...she's"<p>A lightbulb went off in Akanes head as she put two and two together. "I got this one Ranma. I know what Lias coming down with." she said as she got to her feet.<p>"What is it?" Ranma asked.<p>Akane glanced back at Ranma. "Puberty." she said.<p>Ranma grimaced. "Oh." he said. "You handle this Akane. You got more experience than I do in this area." he added.<p>"I know. I helped you, remember?" Akane said as she headed to the door. "Come on Matoko, I'll need your help." she added.<p>Matoko blinked in confusion. "Shouldn't Mr Sao- I mean Ranma come with you?" she asked.<p>Akane shook her head. "No Matoko, the last thing your sister needs is her father. Trust me on this." she said.<p>"Okay..." Matoko said, unsure of what Akane meant.<p>After getting Lia cleaned up Akane sat her and Matoko down and explained to them just what was happening to her body. Akane had to remind Lia that Ranma went through the same process each month, which calmed Lia down enough to listen.<p>After explaining to Lia on what to do Akane left Matoko to look after her sister and went looking for Ranma. She found him where he normally went to think, the roof.<p>"There you are." Akane said as she landed on the roof.<p>"Huh? Oh, hi Akane." Ranma said as he glanced over his shoulder. "How's Lia?" he asked.<p>"Well, she's freaked out about the whole thing." Akane said as she sat down. "I don't think it's really occurred to her that she's a girl." she added.<p>Ranma sighed. "Well, she knows now." he said.<p>Akane nodded. "Yeah, that's true." she said. "Of course, now we have to have the 'talk' with her and Matoko." she added with a sigh.<p>Ranma smacked his fore head with the heel of his hand. "Oh crap, I forgot about that." he said.<p>"Me too." Akane said. "Though I think it would be a good idea to wait until after this passes." she added.<p>"Why?" Ranma asked.<p>"Well, right now Lias a little... touchy at the moment." she said. "Like you were when this happened to you." she added.<p>Ranma grimaced. "Ouch. Definitely a good idea to wait then." he said.<p>Akane nodded. "Yeah, Definitely." she said.<p>"By the way, how's Matoko taking it?" Ranma asked.<p>"Pretty well, actually." Akane said with a shrug. "I think she knows about it already. She seems embarrassed about it more than anything else." she added.<p>"Well that's good. Lias gonna need someone with their head on strait." Ranma said with a nod. "I know I do." he added.<p>Akane gave Ranma a surprised look. "You do?" she asked. "How come?"<p>"She and Matoko are growing up Akane, and I'm not ready for that." he said.<p>"Me too Ranma. Me too." Akane said as she rubbed his back.<p>A week later Lia was back to normal and then she and her sister were sat down by their parents and given the 'talk'. For Matoko it was a refresher course, but for Lia it was an eye opener as she discovered why some of the boys at school had been acting like they did.<p>And as Ranma explained what exactly was going on in a boys mind Lias pupils shrank, her pigtail stood on end, she manifested a blue -white battle aura.<p>"I can't believe it!" she said.<p>"It's sad but true Lia." Ranma said.<p>"Why those...those...Perverts!" Lia hissed as she summoned her mallet. "Ooooh...when I get my hands on them, they are so gonna get it!" she said, brandishing the mallet.<p>"Lia, watch the battle aura, your scorching the tatami." Akane said. "But you've got the right idea though. I've found mallets are very effective on perverts." she added.<p>"I agree." Ranma said. "Just hit any boy that gets near you and you'll be okay." he added.<p>"Ranma!" Akane admonished. "Don't listen to him, he's just being your father. Not all boys are perverts Lia." she said as she looked at Lia.<p>"Hey, as far as I'm concerned any boy who even looks at my daughters that way is a pervert." Ranma said as he crossed his arms.<p>Akane chuckled at Ranmas comment before she continued.<p>"Anyways, as I was saying not all boys are perverts." Akane said. "Some are actually perfect gentlemen, like your father." she added as she nudged Ranma.<p>"But they are a very small minority." Ranma added. "So be careful."<p>"Oh, I will, believe me." Lia said as she hefted her mallet. "They try anything they are gonna get it!" she added, her pigtail wreathing like a snake.<p>"That's the idea Lia." Ranma said as Lia stomped out to practice her mallet swing.<p>"Do you want us to teach you some ways to defend yourself?" Akane asked the other girl.<p>Matoko shook her head. "No, Mama taught me a few techniques to use on perverts." she said.<p>"Like what?" Ranma asked.<p>"Well, she said that a knee to the groin was very effective." she said.<p>Ranma and Akane both winced at Matokos comment. Both were surprised at how nonchalantly Matoko put it.<p>"Ouch." Ranma said. "That's just plain viscous." he added.<p>Matoko nodded. "Yes, it is." she said. "Mama wanted to make sure what happened to her didn't happen to me." she added.<p>"You're mother is a very smart woman." Akane said. "Yes, she was." Matoko agreed. "And I'm glad she taught me." she added as the house shook to a mallet impact.<p>The next day at school the hentai there were given a first hand demonstration of the Anything Goes Mallet Techniques. It made an impression on them, generally on their skulls. The smart ones left Lia alone, while the dumb ones continued to bother her.<p>And the ones tried to mess with Matoko discovered she wasn't the type to just slap your face. After turning a few of the hentai into sopranos she was given a wide berth, while Lia happily continued smash any male who got within arms reach.<p>As the year progressed both girls had growth spurts, each in a different way. Matokos Caucasian heritage came out and she gained an inch in that year alone, while Lia had what she considered to be the dubius distinction of being the first to need a bra.<p>The duty of taking Lia shopping for that particular item fell to Ranma after Lia came home with a note from her gym teacher. After a splash of water to change and leaving Christian and Matoko home Ranma took Lia off to the store.<p>They returned three hours later with two shopping bags and Lia beet red. After taking the shopping bags from Ranma Lia stomped upstairs to her room to leave them there before going to the roof to sulk.<p>As Matoko continued to grow Akane sewing ability came in handy, as she was able to alter the girls clothes and school uniforms to accommodate their growth while also continuing to keep Christian in clothes as well with out destroying their budget.<p>As both girls began to ride the roller coaster of teenage life they were glad they had each other and their family to rely on, giving them something to hold onto as their lives became more and more complex.<p>As time passed they were going to be very thankful for that stability.<p>End.<p>A sub-school of the Saotome Marital Techniques.<p>Akanes name for her mallet techniques.<p>Except Genda, Izu, Christian, and Ranma.
