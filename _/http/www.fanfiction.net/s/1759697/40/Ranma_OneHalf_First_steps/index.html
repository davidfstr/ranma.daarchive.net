</div><p>1Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Four.</p><p>Chapter Eight.</p><p>"Ranma, wake up."</p><p>Ranma groaned and tried to curl up under the covers to get away from the sudden intrusion to his slumber.</p><p>"Ranma, wake <i>up!</i>" Akane repeated, shaking his shoulder. "Naotas on the phone and he wants to talk to you."</p><p>Ranma cracked one eye open to glare at his wife.</p><p>"Did he say why he's calling at this kami -forsaken hour?" he grumbled.</p><p>Akane gave Ranma deadpan look as she handed the phone to her husband.</p><p>"No." she answered. "And its seven forty-three."</p><p>Ranma took the phone away from his wife and put it to his ear.</p><p>"Moshi moshi." He said. "This had better be important Naota, or I'm gonna run you into the ground."</p><p>"It is." Naotas voice answered from the handset. "This is the heads -up you asked for."</p><p>Ranma was instantly awake then and sat up in bed. Akane started to ask what was going on but stopped when Ranma held up his hand.</p><p>"Okay. Thanks." Ranma answered. "Anything else I should know?"</p><p>'Yeah. Two things." Naota said. "One: keep everyone in the house today, no matter what."</p><p>"Okay." Ranma answered. "And the other?"</p><p>"If things don't work out, run." Naota said before hanging up.</p><p>Ranma sat there and listened to the dial tone in his ear for a couple of seconds before turning off the phone. Handing the phone back to Akane he threw the covers back and stood up.</p><p>'Akane, where are the kids?" he asked.</p><p>"Where are… Christian and Mamimi are downstairs in the furo, and Lia and Matoko are still sleeping."</p><p>"Good." Ranma said as he walked to the dresser to get some clothes. "They're staying home today. Call your sisters and tell them to keep everyone home too, and to not answer the door."</p><p>'Why?" Akane asked. "Ranma, what's going on?"</p><p>"I'll explain when everyone is downstairs." Ranma said.</p><p>Akane nodded and got up as Ranma began to pull his pants on.</p><p>Stepping out of the master bedroom Akane went down to Matokos room and gently knocked on the door.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>Stepping inside Akane found Matoko sitting at her dresser brushing out her hair and Lia curled up in a ball on Matokos futon.</p><p>"Oh, you're both in here." Akane said as she stepped in.</p><p>"Uh -huh." Matoko answered. Nodding her head at Lia she continued. "It was last night's storm."</p><p>"Oh. Well, anyways, your father decided that everyone's staying home today." Akane said as she looked at Lia.</p><p>Matoko blinked in surprise. "Why?" she asked.</p><p>Akane shrugged. "Ranma said he's explain when everyone's at the table."</p><p>"I'll tell Lia when she wakes up." Matoko said as Akane left.</p><p>After she finished brushing her hair Matoko stepped over to the futon and crouched down next to her sister. Reaching over she gently shook Lias shoulder.</p><p>"Lia, wake up." She said gently.</p><p>Lia jerked slightly and opened her eyes.</p><p>"Nyaow?" Lia asked sleepily as she opened her eyes. "What is it?"</p><p>"It's time to wake up." Matoko answered.</p><p>"Oh." Lia with a sigh. "We had better get ready for school." She said as she stretched.</p><p>"Not today." Matoko said. "We're staying home."</p><p>Lia gave her sister a puzzled look. "Why?"</p><p>"Ranma said he'd explain." Matoko said.</p><p>"Oh, okay." Lia said as she sat up.</p><p>Getting up Matoko got her self a bathrobe while Lia yawned and stretched backwards, bending nearly double. Getting up she followed her sister out into the hall. As they neared the stairs Lias sensitive cats ears picked up conversation coming from downstairs.</p><p>Training her ears forwards Lia tuned in on the conversation.</p><p><i>"So whats this about anyways?"</i></p><p><i>"I told you, your father will explain when everyone's at the table Christian." </i></p><p><i>"No, I meant why do we have to stay in the house?" </i></p><p><i>"Christian, look. All I know is that Naota called in and talked to your father. After that Ranma said to keep everyone home. That's all I know." </i></p><p><i>"Huh. He's going for it." </i></p><p><i>'Who?" </i></p><p><i>"Naota. He's gonna go confront his clan."</i></p><p><i>'how do you know this?" </i></p><p><i>"Easy. I gave him the idea. Why do you think he's been training so hard lately?"</i></p><p>Lia stopped dead as a block of ice formed in her gut.</p><p>"no…." she whispered.</p><p>'Hm?" Matoko asked, looking over her shoulder at Lia. "Did you say something Lia?"</p><p>"Ah… I said I was going to go put some pant's on. It's kind of chilly." Lia answered, scratching the back of her head.</p><p>"Oh, okay." Matoko said before starting down the stairs. "I'll be downstairs."</p><p>Lia waited until Matoko was down the stairs before running as silently as possible to her room and slipping inside. Shutting the door she locked it and then headed over to the dresser. Pulling her shirt off Lia walked over to her dresser and gritted her teeth.</p><p><i>'I can't believe this!</i> <i>Why the </i>hell <i>Dad and Naota tell me?" </i>she thought as she yanked her top drawer open. <i>"I'm not some delicate little flower who has to be protected!"</i></p><p>Taking out a sports bra Lia shoved the drawer closed before pulling her bra on.</p><p><i>"The nerve of those two! And not telling Mom either!" </i>Lia fumed as she adjusted her self. <i>"I get my hands on Naota I'm gonna give him the mallet for this!" </i></p><p>Pulling open her second drawer Lia yanked a pair of black kung -fu pants and shoved the drawer closed.</p><p><i>"After I hug and kiss him to death." </i>She thought as she stepped into her pants. Tying her pants waist Lia fought the urge to cry. <i>'Dammit, why do the men in my life have to be so damn chivalrous?"</i></p><p>Yanking open her third drawer Lia took out a shirt and put it on. Sliding the drawer shut with her foot she began to do the ties on the shirt when there was a knock at the door.</p><p>'Lia? You coming?" her father asked.</p><p>Lia blinked and thought for a few seconds before speaking.</p><p>'Ah -yeah. I'm just putting some clothes on." She said. "I'll be out in a sec."</p><p>'Okay." Ranma answered.</p><p>Lia looked at the door as her fathers footsteps went down the hall.</p><p><i>"Shit! I cant go to the mud room now." </i>Lia thought furiously. Turning she went to the window. <i>"It looks like I'm going to have to go barefoot." </i></p><p>Opening her curtains Lia saw that it was still raining outside. Sighing she reached up and unlatched the window.</p><p><i>"Well, I needed a bath anyways." </i>Lia thought as she slid the window open.</p><p>Hopping up on the window sill Lia stepped out on the outside wall using her sk8ter technique. Turning she closed the window behind her and clambering up onto the roof. Standing on the roof she got her bearings before roof hopping away.</p><p>Inside the house Ranma was heading back upstairs to check on Lia. Reaching her door he knocked but got no answer.</p><p>'Lia?" he asked, knocking again.</p><p>Still not getting an answer Ranma tried to open the door but found it locked.</p><p>"What the-?" he asked. Extending his chi sense he discovered Lias room was empty. "<i>Shit!</i>" he hissed.</p><p>Charging back downstairs Ranma ran to the computer room and snatched the cell out of it's charger.</p><p>'Ranma, what's going on?" Akane asked from the main room.</p><p>"Lias gone.' Ranma answered as he came out of the computer room. 'She must have overheard Christian."</p><p>"So what are you doing?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I'm going out looking for her." Ranma said. "Before she gets herself killed. I have the cell, so call me if you hear anything."</p><p>'Okay." Akane said with a nod.</p><p>Heading for the mud room Ranma looked back at Akane. "Remember, don't let anyone in unless it's me or Lia." He said.</p><p>Akane nodded as she followed Ranma into the mud room. Pulling his shoes on Ranma turned to go to the door but Akane stopped him.</p><p>"What?" he asked.</p><p>Standing on tiptoe Akane gave him a kiss.</p><p>'For luck." She said.</p><p>"Thanks." Ranma said. "I love you Akane."</p><p>"I love you too Ranma." She answered.</p><p>Ranma nodded and stepped outside. Akane watched him go, then turned back inside, fear gnawing at her gut.</p><p>Naota felt a jerk as the train he had boarded began to pull away from the station. Slouched down in a seat with his hood up over his head he kept his markings hidden and made him look like the many sullen young men populating post modern Tokyo. Earphones running from his sweatshirt pocket to his ears completed the illusion, though most teens would be listening to the latest j rock or j pop band rather than the Black Album.</p><p>After listening to Metallica for a few minutes Naota decided he wasn't in the mood and pulled out his MP3 player and swapped out the card for another one. Pressing 'play' he considered his plan of attack.</p><p><i>"Well, just walking up to them and asking nicely won't do it." </i>Naota thought. <i>"I'm gonna have to use the KISS principal and out -reason them. Of course the thing with simple plans is that they are so bloody hard to pull off."</i></p><p>Sighing Naota looked out the window at the landscape flowing by.</p><p><i>"And the hard part with this plan is going to be getting them to listen to me." </i>He thought. <i>"Which means I'm gonna have to 'ask nicely', as Akane would put it. And risk getting my ass killed in the process." </i></p><p>Nodding in time to the music Naotas mouth quirked into a smile.</p><p><i>"Naota you fool, you had to go fall in love, didn't you?" </i>he thought.</p><p>Lia shivered as she reached Naotas door and rang the buzzer. She had roof hopped across Nerima, and was soaked through. Her thin cotton clothes were about as heat retaining as tissue paper and her being barefoot didn't help. Hopping from one foot to the other on the cold concrete she rubbed her tail to get some warmth in it as she waited for the door to be answered.</p><p>Finally the latched popped and Kamon stuck his head out.</p><p>"Lia, what are you doing here?" he asked. "And why are you barefoot in this weather?"</p><p>"Because I was in a hurry." Lia answered. "Where's Naota?"</p><p>"Not here." Kamon told her. "He just left."</p><p>"Shit!" Lia swore as she stomped her foot on the concrete. "I missed him!"</p><p>'Well, I doubt you'll catch him." Kamon said as he looked at Lia. 'He's taken the eight forty -five train."</p><p>Lia sighed and looked around frustrated. Kamon watched her and stepped aside and gestured into the apartment.</p><p>"How about you come inside and have a cup of tea? You look like a drowned rat." Kamon offered.</p><p>Lia opened her mouth to refuse but common sense kicked in right then and prevented her.</p><p>'O-okay." Lia said.</p><p>Stepping inside she put on a pair of house slippers as Kamon looked over her dripping wet clothes with a critical eye.</p><p>'You're gonna catch cold in those." He said, pointing to Lias clothes. "How about you change into some of Naotas sweats while we run them the dryer."</p><p>"I-I-I'm okay with that." Lia said as her teeth chattered. "I'm f-f-f-f-freezing."</p><p>Shutting the door behind her Kamon pointed to the bathroom as he headed to Naotas room.</p><p>"The bathrooms in there." He said.</p><p>"T-t-t-thank you." Lia said as she headed to the door.</p><p>"You're welcome." Kamon said as he stepped inside Naotas room.</p><p>He stepped out a couple of minutes later with a dark grey bundle in his arms and walked over to the bathroom door. Knocking he looked down as Lia open the door a crack and stuck her arm out.</p><p>"Your clothes." He said.</p><p>'G-g-gimme." Lia answered.</p><p>"Here you go." Kamon said as he handed the clothes to Lia.</p><p>"Thanks." Lia said as she shut the door.</p><p>Kamon headed to the kitchen and got down two cups from the cupboard. There were two cups steeping when Lia stepped out of the bathroom, Naotas sweat hanging extremely loose on her. In her hands there was a purple and black bundle that were her clothes.</p><p>"Where…..?" Lia asked.</p><p>'The door to your left." Kamon said, pointing to said door.</p><p>'Thanks." Lia said.</p><p>After putting her clothes in the dryer Lia joined Kamon at the table. They sat and sipped their tea in silence for a few moments before Kamon broke the ice.</p><p>"So…" he began "I take it you know about Naotas plan?"</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said. "I just found out about it today."</p><p>"oh. I see. That would explain why you were at our door barefoot and without an umbrella." Kamon answered.</p><p>Lia looked at her cup for a few moments before she looked up at Kamon.</p><p>'Kamon, why didn't he tell me?" she asked.</p><p>Kamon was silent for several seconds before he sighed and looked at Lia.</p><p>"Because he didn't want you to get hurt." He said.</p><p>Lia frowned and looked back at her teacup.</p><p>"I'm not helpless." She muttered. Rubbing her eye she glanced up at Kamon. "I can understand him wanting to protect me, but not telling me? Why did he do that?"</p><p>"Because he wanted you involved with this as little as possible." He answered. "I assumed he explained to you the dangers of being his fiance?"</p><p>Lia nodded and sipped her tea as Kamon continued.</p><p>"That's why. The only people he's told are myself and your father." Kamon said as he picked up his teacup. "He's not even told Kenji, and the two of them are practically brothers."</p><p>"How thoughtful of him." Lia murmured as Kamon sipped his tea.</p><p>Looking into her teacup Lia rubbed her eyes as she felt her head get heavy. Putting down his teacup Kamon looked at Lia as she struggled to keep her head up.</p><p>"He's always been that way. Ever since he was little." Kamon said.</p><p>"Oh. That's nice…." Lia mumbled.</p><p>"Finish up your tea and I'll make you a fresh cup." Kamon suggested.</p><p>"Okay….." Lia said.</p><p>Straitening up she drained her cup and sat it back down. She tottered back and forth for a second as she dazedly looked at Kamon.</p><p>"Hey….you put something into that tea…." She said before collapsing backwards onto the floor.</p><p>Kamon put his teacup down and went to Lias side. Shaking her shoulder he checked to see that she was okay.</p><p>"Lia?" he asked.</p><p>Getting a soft snore for an answer he sighed and put his hand to her forehead. 'Tsk'ing to himself he shook his head an gathered Lia up in his arms.</p><p>"Just as I thought. You went and caught yourself a fever, you silly girl." He said. Getting up he began to take her to the safest place in the apartment, the cesspool called Naotas room(1). "No wonder Naotas fallen for you."</p><p>After depositing Lia on Naotas bed and covering her up Kamon stepped out and went to the phone. Picking up the handset he dialed and waited for the party on the other end to pick up.</p><p>"Hello."</p><p>"Ranma? Lia showed up at my place." Kamon said.</p><p>'Good. You think you can keep her there for the day? I don't want to swing by and attract undue attention." Ranma said.</p><p>"Will do." Kamon answered.</p><p>"Just keep her safe, will ya? That's all I ask." Ranma said.</p><p>"Don't worry Saotome." Kamon said as he cradled the phone between his head and shoulder. Reaching to the back of his waistband he drew his Smith &amp; Wesson 4563 and checked the chamber. "I'll guard her like she was my own."</p><p>"That's all I ask." Ranma said before hanging up.</p><p>Hanging the phone up Kamon tucked his pistol back in his waistband and went back to the table. Sitting down he looked into his teacup and sighed.</p><p><i>"I've already had to tell one man his daughter was dead when Haruko (2) died." </i>He thought. <i>"I don't plan on doing it again." </i></p><p>Noise assaulted Naota as he walked the length of the market in Akihabara, heading to one particular store. Underneath his hood his ears were folded back against his skull in an attempt to block off the assault of the noise. Turning a corner he saw a sign and headed to that particular store.</p><p>Stepping around the street sign advertising a sale on karoke machines Naota headed inside and walked to the counter. The clerk looked up at Naotas approach.</p><p>"Oh, hello, is there something I can help you with…." The clerk trailed off as Naota pulled back his hood.</p><p>'I'm here to see Akutagawa -san." Naota told the clerk.</p><p>'He's in the back." The clerk answered.</p><p>"Thank you." Naota said before he turned and began to walk to the back of the store. Looking over his shoulder he shot a glare at the clerk. "And if you try to go for that charm key chain under the counter I'll make you eat it."</p><p>The clerk gulped and carefully removed her hand from under the counter. Continuing to back Naota pushed aside a pair of swinging doors and entered the back of the store. Threading his way through a narrow aisle between two stacks of boxes Naota came to the back office, which was a tiny little box mostly taken up by Akutagawas desk.</p><p>Akutagawa was an old, wrinkled man with wispy white hair who was chain smoking. Naota tried to breathe through his mouth to avoid the stench of the stale cigarette smoke, but without success. He also picked up the distinct scent of Sunatory scotch intermingled with scent of bad coffee, along with a thousand other scents he'd rather not identify.</p><p>Akutagawa finished his phone call an hung up. Looking up at Naota with bloodshot eyes he spoke.</p><p>'What do you want, boy?" he asked in an irritated tone.</p><p>'I want to talk about my place in the clan." Naota answered.</p><p>"well, make an appointment. Just because you're Dokuohtei Sanos grandson didn mean you just barge in like some gajin-" Akutagawa said as he reached for the phone, but stopped when Naota grabbed his wrist in a vice -like grip.</p><p>"We're going to talk about this <i>now, </i>old man." Naota said calmly, steel in his voice.</p><p>Akutagawa looked down at his wrist. "Let go of my wrist, <i>boy</i>, and I'll let this go." He said.</p><p>Hearing three airs of feet behind him Naotas mouth quirked into a smile as Akutagawa continued.</p><p>"Don't let go, and you're not the one who's going to pay the price. It could be your father, your grandfather,…" He said. Smirking he looked Naota in the eye. "Or perhaps that little redhead you're so taken with?"</p><p>The whites of Naotas eyes flashed red and he squeezed Akutagawas hand until he could hear the bones grind together. Leaning in he pulled his lips back, exposing razor sharp teeth.</p><p>"And what, pray tell, do think will keep me from coming after you and the clan if something were to happen to them?" he rumbled, his voice taking on a demonic edge.</p><p>"Nothing." Akutagawa answered as a smile quirked at his lips. "Not that you're going to even get that far." He said as the three men Naota had heard stepped into the office.</p><p>"Lets go kid." One of them said as he put his hand on Naotas shoulder.</p><p>Naota released his hold on Akutagawa and straitened up. Turning slightly he looked over his shoulder at the man who had his hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"Okay." He said with a shrug.</p><p>They didn't even have time to blink as Naota went into action. Twisting to his right he brought his right arm up and batted th other man away, Naotas demonic strength sending the man smashing into the wall and snapping his bones like twigs. Continuing to twist Naota transitoned into a spin kick, the cramped confines of the office mattering not a whit to him as his leg smashed through drywall, two -by fours, and plywood like it was tissue paper to send the first mans companions smashing into the wall with him.</p><p>Coming out of the spin kick Naota grabbed Akutagawas desk with his right hand and tossing it aside, the centimeter-thick bolts holding it into the concrete ripping free as it was sent smashing into the opposite wall. Moving in one fluid movement Naota stepped forwards, grabbed Akutagawa by the neck with his left hand and slammed him against the wall.</p><p>'Don't bet on it old man." He said in deceptively even voice. "Lay one finger on Lia and there will be rivers of blood. And that's just what her father will do."</p><p>Leaning in to Akutagawa Naota spoke directly into his ear.</p><p>"And after <i>I </i>got through with you, you'd be wishing you were dead. Do I make myself clear?" he said.</p><p>Akutagawa nodded, his eyes the size of dinner plates. Maintaining his hold on Akutagawas throat Naota continued.</p><p>"When I came in here, I said I wanted to talk about my place in the clan." Naota said. "Here's what I have to say: I want to be exempt from missions, and I want my family, current and future, to be exempt from being a part of the Hagakure School. In return, I will pass on everything I have learned, allowing the clan to make use of it."</p><p>Looking Akutagawa in the eye Naota continued.</p><p>"Is that acceptable, old man?" he asked.</p><p>'Considering the alternative, yes, it is." Akutagawa rasped, his eyes never leaving Naota.</p><p>Akutagawa sank to the floor, coughing and wheezing as Naota turned and stepped towards the door.</p><p>"Wait." Akutagawa croaked.</p><p>"What is it, old man?" Naota asked.</p><p>"In the filing cabinet to your left, in the top drawer to the back there's a bottle of Scotch." Akutagawa said, pointing to a cabinet that had miraculously survived the carnage. "Get it for me, would ya?"</p><p>Reaching over Naota pulled the bottle from the drawer and tossed it into Akutagawas lap before leaving. Unscrewing the top took a swig as he watched Naota leave. Rubbing his throat Akutagawa looked at the smashed remains of his office and shook his head.</p><p>"That's it, I'm getting too old for this. I'm retiring." He said before taking another swig.</p><p>Naota felt the tug of inertia as the train pulled out of the station. Even though it was mid -morning and the rush hour mob had long since gotten to work Naota stood, too high on adrenaline to sit still. Feeling the rhythm of the train Naota grinned to himself as he thought of his victory.</p><p><i>"Finally, I did it. After hundreds of years the Sano family will be free of the Hagakure." </i>He thought. <i>"I can't wait to tell Lia." </i></p><p>At the thought of Lia his grin faltered. She was going to be…<i>upset </i>that he and her father didn't tell her about Naotas little plan, to put it mildly.</p><p><i>"Oh well. Ranma taught me a technique to deal with situations like this." </i>He thought as he mentally reviewed the steps for doing the Crouch of the Wild Tiger. <i>"And if all else fails, I can remind her of what could have happened. That, and have a bottle of aspirin</i></p><p><i>handy." </i></p><p>At the thought of the alternative Naota realized just how close he came to disaster when he had confronted Akutagawa in the store. His right leg began to shake, followed by his left leg and then the rest of his body followed suit. Very shakily he sat down and took several deep breaths.</p><p>Once he had regained control Naota sat back up and watched he scenery speed by as the train sped towards Nerima.</p><p><i>"On second thought, when I get home go to Lia first and tell her just how much I love her." </i>He thought. Sighing he closed his eyes and leaned his head against the window. <i>"There's nothing like life and death to make you realize just how much you care for someone." </i></p><p>Naota struggled to keep awake for the rest of the train ride home. When they finally pulled into Nerima Station Naota stood up and exited off the train. Wearily he plodded home, the rain picking up as another storm came in on a warm front.</p><p>By the time he got home Naota was soaked through to the bone. Putting his key in the lock he opened the door and stepped inside.</p><p>"I'm home." he said as he stepped in.</p><p>Shutting the door behind him Naota kicked his sneakers off and shrugged his sweatshirt off. Walking to the bathroom he saw his father and grandfather engrossed in a game of shogi. Stepping past them he headed to the bathroom to strip out of his wet clothes.</p><p>He stepped out of the bathroom a couple of minutes later clad only in his boxers, his clothing hanging up over the tub to drip. Padding to his room he stepped inside, looking to get a change of dry clothes and some shuteye.</p><p>As tired as he was Naota didn't notice the lump curled up under the covers. Taking a pair of sweats out of the drawer he pulled them on. After fastening the tail hole he sat down on his bed.</p><p>Naota was thoroughly surprised when he sat down the bedcovers moved and 'nyaowed' at him. Turning around he pulled the covers back slightly and was surprised to see Lia asleep in his bed, in a sweatshirt of his.</p><p><i>"the hell?" </i>he asked himself as he looked at Lia. Sitting there he debated with himself on what to do. <i>"Oh the hell with it." </i>He thought as exhaustion pulled at him.</p><p>Pushing Lia gently over Naota flipped the covers back and lay down with his back to Lia. Pulling the covers over himself Naota was soon fast asleep.</p><p>Lia, sensing a source of heat immediately snuggled up to it, which made Naota roll over in his sleep and put his arm around her.</p><p>It was mid-afternoon when Lia finally awoke from her slumber. As she regained conciseness she was aware of several things; one, it was still raining outside, two, she was nice and warm, three, she was lying against something warm and solid.</p><p>Feeling the arm around her Lia lifted the covers slightly and saw the gold demon markings which told her it was Naota who was in bed with her. Slightly panicked by this she checked and found both herself and Naota to be clothed.</p><p>With a slight sigh Lia realized what had happened.</p><p><i>"Naota must've wanted to take a nap but didn't want to disturb me." </i>She thought. <i>"And we must have rolled together in our sleep." </i></p><p>With a content smile Lia snuggled up to Naota and pulled the covers up some more.</p><p><i>"Though I must say, I could definitely get used to this." </i>She thought as she began to drift back to sleep.</p><p>"Lia?"</p><p>Naotas murmured question brought her back to wakefulness.</p><p>"Yeah?" she asked quietly.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Yeah. Your father slipped me a mickey." Lia answered.</p><p>"Oh, okay." Naota said.</p><p>"Speaking of your father, he said you didn't tell me because you wanted to protect me." Lia said quietly as she grabbed Naotas forearm.</p><p>Naota was silent for several moments before he responded.</p><p>"That's right." He said. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but I didn't want you getting caught up and getting in over your head. And before you say anything, there's something else I'd like to say."</p><p>'What is it?" Lia asked.</p><p>Moving his other arm under her Naota drew Lia into a tight embrace. Burying his nose in her hair he inhaled her scent before he spoke.</p><p>"I came very close to losing you today, and I just want to say that I-…I love you, Lia Saotome." Naota said. "And I'm not going to stop."</p><p>Lias breath caught in her throat as Naota spoke, and it took her several seconds before she could respond.</p><p>"I-….I- I love you too, Naota Sano." She said, tightening her grip on Naotas forearm. "And I'm not going to stop either."</p><p>They lay there in silence for several minutes Lia jumped at a sudden flash of lightning. Naota looked down at her as she burrowed under the covers.</p><p>"You're afraid of thunder and lightning?" he asked.</p><p>"Yes." Lias voice answered from under the covers. "Ever since I was eight."</p><p>"What happened?" Naota asked as Lia carefully reemerged from under the covers.</p><p>"My parents went out to fight someone very dangerous." Lia said. "I thought the storm was going to take them away."</p><p>Leaning her head against Naotas chest she continued. "That's why I went out after you." She added quietly.</p><p>Naota sighed and put his chin on top of her head.</p><p>"Don't worry Lia. I'm not going anywhere." He said. "Speaking of going places though, shouldn't we be getting you home? Your parents are probably worried sick."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said. "But its still raining and I think I'm coming down with something."</p><p>Naota smiled as he moved his hand to her forehead. "How about I wrap you in a blanket and carry you home?" he asked.</p><p>"That'll do." Lia answered.</p><p>Ranma looked up suddenly from his spot at the table. Getting up he headed to the door.</p><p>"What is it?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Naotas here." Ranma answered. "With Lia."</p><p>Akane briefly wondered how much having Lia had affected Ranma before getting up and following her husband to the door. When the reached the door they found Naota and a blanket wrapped Lia standing on their stoop.</p><p>"Well? How did it go?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Naota gave Ranma a tired smile as Lia stepped in past them.</p><p>'Well,….let me put it this way." Naota began. "I'm the last Sano in the Hagakure School. Period."</p><p>Ranma smiled and slapped Naota on the shoulder.</p><p>"I knew you could do it." He said.</p><p>'Thank you, sensei." Naota answered. Turning he prepared to head home. "And now if you don't mind, I'm going home for some shuteye."</p><p>"Hold it right there, buster." Akane said.</p><p>Ranma and Naota both froze at Akanes voice. Turning around, careful not to make any sudden moves they slowly faced Akane. She was standing with her feet firmly planted on the floor and a uncomfortably <i>large </i>mallet in her hands.</p><p>'You two have a <i>lot </i>of explaining to do." She said, her tone brooking no nonsense. "Now lets go inside and you two can explain in minute detail exactly <i>what </i>it was that possessed you to do what you did."</p><p>Naota and Ranma looked at each other and then back to Akane.</p><p>"Yes dear." Ranma said.</p><p>"Yes Sensei." Naota said.</p><p>Turning around both of them went inside the house to the main room, where they sat down at the table and started at the beginning.</p><p>Lia was almost to the top of the stairs when she met Matoko. Seeing her sister Matoko hurried over to Lia.</p><p>"Lia, are you okay? What happened?" she asked.</p><p>"I'm fine Matoko." Lia answered. "I just caught the chills from being out in the rain."</p><p>'The chills?" Matoko asked as she put her hand on Lias forehead. "It's more like you caught a cold."</p><p>"Oh, great." Lia grumbled.</p><p>'Exactly." Matoko said as she took her sister by the shoulders. "Now lets get you to bed."</p><p>"Okay." Lia sighed as Matoko began to steer her towards her room.</p><p>They were almost to Lias bedroom door when Akanes sudden screaming made them stop and look.</p><p>"It sounds like Mom found out just how close we came to disaster." Lia commented.</p><p>"I hope she didn lose control of her aura like she did this morning." Matoko said. "We're almost out of replacement tatami."</p><p>"Mom lost control?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Almost. She scorched as section of tatami and then chased Ranma around the house with a mallet while cussing him out." Matoko answered as she shut the bedroom door behind them.</p><p>"Shoot, I missed it." Lia said.</p><p>"And where were you?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"Naotas. I would have called, but his father slipped me something in a cup of tea." Lia answered as she dropped the blanket that had been wrapped around her.</p><p>Before Lia could say anything she found herself wrapped in a hug from Matoko.</p><p>"I was worried." Matoko said.</p><p>'I know." Lia answered. "And I'm sorry for doing that, but I was worried about Naota, and you know me, I gotta be the protector…"</p><p>"I know." Matoko said as she squeezed tighter. As she hugged her sister she became aware of something. "Lia, where's your bra?"</p><p>"erk!" was Lias response as her eyes went wide. Pulling away from her sister she looked up in Matokos face. 'If I tell you, promise you wont flip?" she asked.</p><p>Matoko nodded and then Lia continued.</p><p>"It's probably still in the Sanos dryer, along with my panties and the rest of my clothes." She said. "Kamon lent me these sweats of Naotas while I ran my clothes through the dryer."</p><p>'I was wondering who's they were." Matoko said as she stepped over to the closet where Lia kept her futon (3).</p><p>Pulling out the futon she laid it out while Lia pulled out her bedding. Unfolding the blanket Lia laid it out over her futon and then got into her futon. As she pulled the covers over herself she looked at her sister.</p><p>'Matoko, can you keep a secret?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Yes." Matoko answered with a nod.</p><p>"Well, come here. I don't want Christian to hear this." Lia said.</p><p>Nodding in understanding Matoko walked over to her sister and knelt down.</p><p>'What is it?" Matoko asked.</p><p>Leaning in to where her mouth was almost a centimeter from her sisters ear Lia spoke.</p><p>'Naota told me he loved me." She whispered.</p><p>Matokos eyes went as wide as dinner plates and she clamped her hands over her mouth to keep from squealing in delight. After several deep breaths she managed to get herself under control and carefully removed her hands from her mouth.</p><p>"He did?" she whispered.</p><p>At Lias nod she glomped her sister in a Saotome Sibling Glomp and tried to squeeze the life out of her.</p><p>'Congratulations." Matoko whispered in Lias ear.</p><p>'Thanks Matoko." Lia whispered back. "Now could you let go please? I can't breathe."</p><p>'Oh, I'm sorry." Matoko said as she released her sister. Looking at her she smiled. "So what are you going to do next?"</p><p>'I don't know." Lia answered. "And I don't think Naota does either."</p><p>Flopping back onto the futon Lia got comfortable. Looking up at her sister she flashed a smile.</p><p>"But we'll find out!" she said.</p><p>Matoko chuckled as she stood up.</p><p>'You know, there are times I envy you and Naota." She said. "At least you two can be candid with each other. Kenjis clueless."</p><p>"Don't lose heart Matoko." Lia said. "Kenjis shy, remember? It's taken a year for him to get so where he didn lock up when hee talks to you."</p><p>"I know." Matoko said as she looked at the floor. Playing with the carpet with her toe she continued. "And that's what makes him so cute."</p><p>Lia smiled as she curled up into a ball.</p><p>'Whatever you say, Matoko.' She said. "Wake me for dinner."</p><p>Matoko gave her sister a slight bow before turning and leaving. Left in the silence of her room Lia relaxed and was soon fast asleep, her mothers screaming from downstairs a comforting presence.</p><p>Naota hummed to himself as he leapt across rooftops to the Saotome home. He was heading over there after school to help Lia get over her cold and to get some studying done. He had had an easy day in class, surprisingly. The usual shenanigans of his classmates and the girls in school not affecting him at all.</p><p>Naota privately suspected that it was because in comparison of the events of the day before, it was nothing.</p><p><i>"There is something to be said about a life or death situation changing your priorities." </i>Naota mused as he neared the Saotome house.</p><p>After landing silently in the yard Naota headed around to the front of the house and rang the doorbell. As he waited he undid the top buttons on his uniform jacket and fanned himself.</p><p><i>"Man, I hate it when we switch over to winter uniforms." </i>He thought as footsteps sounded coming up to the door.</p><p>The latches in the door popped open and the door swung back, revealing Akane on the other side.</p><p>'Hello Naota." She said as she stepped back to allow Naota in.</p><p>"Sensei." Naota said as he stepped in.</p><p>Inside the mud room Naota shucked his uniform jacket and put it on his peg.</p><p>"Finally, I can be rid of that thing!" he said, fanning himself.</p><p>"They made the uniform switch early this year." Akane noted as she and Naota went inside the house.</p><p>Naota nodded. "Yeah. They changed it this year."</p><p>'Oh." Akane said as they entered the main room. "Well, anyways, Ranma made some miso soup for Lia. Why don't you run it up to her?"</p><p>'Yes sensei." Naota answered.</p><p>"And quit calling me that!" Akane said as she went to the kitchen. "We're not in the dojo and I'm not mad at you, just annoyed."</p><p>'Yes Akane." Naota answered.</p><p>'That's better." Akane said as she went into the kitchen. She stepped out a few moments later with a picture and a mug on a tray. "Here. Take this up." She said, handing it over to him.</p><p>Taking the tray Naota headed upstairs to Lias room. Pausing at her door he considered how he was going to open the door when Matoko came up the stairs behind him.</p><p>'Hey Matoko." Naota called out. "Could you give me a hand here?"</p><p>"Certainly Naota." She answered with a smile. Opening the door for him she flashed another smile at him before bowing to him." There you go."</p><p>'Thanks Matoko." Naota said as she walked down the hall to her room. Stepping into the room he saw Lia curled up on her futon. "Lunch." He called.</p><p>'Nyaow?" Lia asked sleepily as she uncurled. Pulling the covers back she looked at Naota. "Oh, hello Naota."</p><p>"Hello." Naota answered. "How are you feeling?"</p><p>Lia groaned as she sat up.</p><p>'Like I died and someone forgot to tell me." She said as she rubbed her eyes.</p><p>"Well, that's what you get for going out into the rain." Naota chided as he set the ray down on the floor next to Lia.</p><p>"And who's fault is that?" asked Lia.</p><p>'Touche'" Naota conceded with a nod as he sat down.</p><p>'So, how was school?" Lia asked as she picked up the mug.</p><p>"Oh, the usual." Naota said as Lia poured herself some miso soup. "Every girl there was chasing me, Suzuki was back to his old tricks-"</p><p>'I thought we pounded some sense into him." Lia interrupted.</p><p>"Apparently it didn't take." Naota said. Continuing on he began to pull homework from his bag. " And Pineapple brain tried to tag me because I was a minute late."</p><p>'What did you do?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Stuffed him into a locker with a couple of my old gym socks." Naota said with a shrug.</p><p>Lia winced and sipped her soup. Digging out a pencil Naota glanced up at Lia.</p><p>'Matoko was pretty happy." Naota commented.</p><p>"That's because I, ah, told her about our little conversation from yesterday." Lia said.</p><p>"I see." Naota answered. Looking at Lia he continued. "Because when I arrived your father didn't attack me I can take it you didn't tell your parents?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said with a nod. Sipping her soup she glanced at Naotas bag, which was bulging at the seams. "You picked up my homework for me?"</p><p>"I wish." Naota answered. "This is my make up homework <i>and </i>extra credit work I picked up so I can salvage my GPA."</p><p>'Oy." Lia said as she raised her eyebrows.</p><p>"Buckling down I see."</p><p>Lias eyes went wide and naota scowled at the sudden intrusion of the voice. Pointing a shaking finger lia tried to avoid spilling her soup as she spoke.</p><p>'Naota, there's a talking cat in my bedroom..." she said in a small voice.</p><p>"That's not a talking cat." Naota said as he turned his head to face the cat. 'Thats a kami."</p><p>"You remembered. I'm touched." the cat said with a smirk.</p><p>"Specifically it's the fuzzball that turned me into a demon." Naota said, a growl in his voice.</p><p>"It is?" Lia asked, staring at the cat. even for Nerima, a talking cat was out of the ordinary.</p><p>"I am." the cat said.</p><p>'So why are you here?" Naota growled as the cat began to groom it's paw. "You want to give me more problems or what?"</p><p>"No, I'm just here to check up on you and give you a heads up." the cat answered, totally unaffected by Naotas tone.</p><p>'What kind of 'heads up?" Naota asked.</p><p>'Well, for starters, you're going to have more to tell her parents than your declarations of love." the cat answered.</p><p>"What are you talking about? Tell my parents what?" Lia asked.</p><p>"That you two, by youkai standards, are already married." the cat said, the smirk evident in his voice. "That incident on the beach, what you did was mate."</p><p>Both were silent as they tried to comprehend what the kami had told them. Seeing their confusion the cat continued.</p><p>"You know what I'm talking about, don't you Naota?" the cat said. "Think about all the materials you've read from that priest at the shrine."</p><p>"The shrine?" Naota asked as he did a quick review of what he had learned. Slowly his jaw dropped as realization dawned on him. "Oh <i>shit!</i>" he hissed.</p><p>"What?" Lia asked as Naota gently took the cup of hot soup from her.</p><p>"He's right." Naota told her. "I read it in a text he e-mailed me."</p><p>"Why didn't you tell me?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Because I've been a little busy Lia, remember? Training, the clan?" Naota answered. " I read it before we went to the beach, but I was so busy I forgot all about it."</p><p>"Naota no baka." Lia answered, pulling a small mallet from Hammerspace and giving Naota a tap on the head.</p><p>"Tell me about it." Naota muttered. "So now what do we do?" he asked, looking at the cat.</p><p>The cat flicked its ears back and forth in a feline version of a shrug.</p><p>"I'm not going to tell you what your next course of action should be." the cat said as it turned around to face the door. Looking back at them it continued. "You two are doing well enough on your own. And on that note I'm bidding you both adieu."</p><p>"Wait-" Naota said as the cat walked through the door and was gone. "damn."</p><p>Naota sighed and handed Lia back her soup.</p><p>"Well, this is completely out of left field." he said as Lia nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Two questions though. One, <i>how </i>exactly are we going to tell our parents about this?" Lia asked.</p><p>Naota rubbed his eyes and looked up at Lia.</p><p>"We'll think of something." he said. "And the other?"</p><p>"When I get cold can I snuggle up against you? You're nice and warm, plus you make a dandy pillow."</p><p>'Won't your parents object?" Naota asked.</p><p>"No." Lia answered, shaking her head. 'I do that everybody."</p><p>'Oh. Okay." naota answered, not sure of what he'd gotten himself into.</p><p>(1)This was because Naotas room has a habit of attacking the unwary.</p><p>(2)Naotas mother.</p><p>(3)For those of you not in the know, in Japan when you're done sleeping you fold up your futon and put it away.</p>
