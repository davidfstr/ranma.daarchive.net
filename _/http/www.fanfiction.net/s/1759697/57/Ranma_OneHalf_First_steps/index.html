</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter 13.</p><p>Early morning haze hung over the streets of Nerima as a Bentley Arnage RL (1)navigated the narrow streets, it's destination a lingerie store set in a modest storefront with a unassuming facade. In the drivers seat sat Gennosuke Katsu, a two tailed kitsune and general pain in the butt. Next to him in the passenger seat sat Aki Dazi, three tailed, and an even bigger pain in the butt.</p><p>Behind them in the rear passenger seat, separated by a smoked panel of bullet proof glass sat Jun. Jun was a one tail, a very weak one tail, very shy, and generally afraid of her own shadow.</p><p>Currently she fidgeting nervously as she watched the buildings roll by outside the smoked bulletproof glass of the windows. Outwardly, she looked a trifle nervous, but on the inside she was a gibbering wreck.</p><p>The night before, she'd had to track down two foxes considerably more powerful than them and tell them what to do. True, she'd had her Lord's authority behind her at the time, but it was still <i>very </i>intimidating. But as intimidating as that had been, compare to her final task those had been nothing.</p><p>She was to relay instructions to Asako Kawashima, daughter of Kyuubi Kawashima and then submit herself to Asako to quote 'learn from her on how to be a kitsune' unquote.</p><p>Asako Kawashima was <i>the </i>leading cause for gossip and rumor about the Kawashima family. The mildest thing she had ever did was make a complete and utter fool of the wolf Koga by getting him blind drunk, then putting him into bed with the Tanyuki lord's two daughters.</p><p>Koga's wife had been incensed by the fact that Asako had humiliated her and her husband in such a public fashion, and had gone after Asako. Ten hours later, beaten, burned, bruised, dirty, and naked, Koga's wife had thrown in the towel and gone home.</p><p>And she was supposed to be her <i>teacher</i>?</p><p>Nervously, Jun swallowed as the car glided to a stop in front of a store. Rolling down the window Aki turned around to look at her.</p><p>"We're here." he said.</p><p>Nodding jerkily, Jun took several deep breaths to steady her nerves as Aki got out and went to the passenger side door and opened it for her. Scooting over she was helped out of the car by him and then she headed to the door, Aki about three steps behind her.</p><p>"W- why are y-you following m -me?" asked Jun as she glanced nervously over her shoulder.</p><p>Aki shrugged as he gave the street a once over. "Lord Kyuubi said I was supposed to be security." he said. "That's what I'm doing."</p><p>Jun nodded jerkily and swallowed. "O -okay." she said as she stepped towards the door. "T-t-thank's."</p><p>Aki chuckled to himself as Jun paused at the door, took a breath, and knocked. Then waited. And waited some more. After about five minutes Jun was reaching to knock again when the blinds behind the door parted at eye height.</p><p>Ten seconds later the deadbolt was thrown and the door swung open to reveal Asako wearing nothing but a bathrobe and a grin.</p><p>"Aki! Jun! What brings you guys here?" she asked, her eyes narrowing. "You need a little 'something something?'"</p><p>Aki visibly choked back laughter as Jun went redder than her hair. Laughing he shook his head. "Nothing like that -my mate would kill me." he said as he slapped Jun on the back. "I'm just security for Jun here."</p><p>Standing up on tiptoe Asako looked over Aki's shoulder at the Bentley sitting at the curb. "Ahhh..." she said. "I see Daddy really came through with the car."</p><p>Aki chuckled as he let his eyes wander southward. "You think Kyuubi would have one of his sons picked up in a Lexus?" he asked. "And nice outfit by the way."</p><p>Asako nodded and glanced down at her robe- and discovered that the belt had came undone, causing her robe to gradually start slipping open.</p><p>"Thank you." she answered, tightening the belt but otherwise doing nothing to protect her modesty. "By the way, I haven't seen your wife lately. How is she?"</p><p>"Seven months pregnant, and as beautiful as ever." Aki answered with a smirk. "And by the way, she says thank you."</p><p>Asako grinned at the compliment. "What can I say? I know my business" she said as she turned her gaze to Jun, who's blush had gotten even deeper. "Jun, dear, calm down or you'll burst into flames.' she said, leaning forwards to put a hand on Jun's shoulder.</p><p>Jun nodded silently and pulled a small piece of origami out of the sleeve of her kimono. "I-I -I was s-s-supposed to gi -give you this f- for your b-b-brother." she stammered, desperately trying to change the conversation.</p><p>Asako blinked and took the origami. "Oh." she said, tucking the folded paper into a pocket of her robe. "Anything else?"</p><p>Jun nodded jerkily. "I- I- I'm al- also supp- posed to b- be l-l-learning h-how t- t-to b-be a k-k-kitsune f- from you." she stammered out, all the while wishing the ground would open up and swallow her.</p><p>Asako on the other hand, merely looked Jun up and down a couple of times, grinned madly, grabbed Jun, and yanked her inside the store.</p><p>"We'll be out in thirty minutes." she told Aki before shutting the door.</p><p>"Okay..." Aki said to the door, not in the least surprised by Asako's behavior</p><p>Putting his hands in his pockets, Aki turned around and watched as Nerima began to wake for the day while behind him in the store all manner of chaos erupted. Twenty minutes later Aki was seriously thinking about having a smoke when the door behind him opened.</p><p>Turning around, he gave a low whistle as he saw Jun being herded out the door by Asako. Gone was Jun's leaf print kimono, replaced by a white suit.</p><p>"Nice." Aki said as he took a look at Jun, who was looking at the ground too mortified to speak. "You do good work Asako."</p><p>Locking the deadbolt Asako nodded. "That I do." she said. "Of course the hard part was trying to get her to wear a bra."</p><p>Aki snorted in amusement as Asako put her keys away and started herding Jun to the car. "Tell me about it. I still remember what it took for you to get the wife to wear one."</p><p>Asako rolled her eyes as Aki opened the car door for them. "Don't remind me." she said. "I think the Meiji Restoration went better." she added, getting another snort from Aki.</p><p>After the two women had gotten into the car Aki shut the door behind them and then got into the passenger seat as Gennosuke started the car.</p><p>"Hey Asako, wasn't it during the Revolution that you pulled that prank on that wolf?" Aki asked as he settled into his seat.</p><p>"Koga, you mean?" Asako asked, glancing at Aki. "Yeah, I did. I spent two years running from his mate."</p><p>Aki snickered as he pulled the latest issue of Icha Icha Paradise out of the glove box "She still mad about that?"</p><p>Asako nodded as she considered Jun out of the corner of her eye. "Yep. I still can't go any big shindigs because of her." she answered. "But, one must sacrifice for the greater good..." she added, getting laughs from Aki and Gennosuke. "And now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for Jun and I to have a little 'girl talk.'"</p><p>With that, Asako raised the glass partition and closed off the passenger compartment from the drivers compartment. Settling back into her seat she crossed her legs and studied Jun, who was sitting on the opposite side of the car desperately trying to blend in with the upholstery</p><p>"<i>Oh, this is going to be fun."</i> thought Asako as a sly smile came to her lips.</p><p>"So." Asako said as way of an opener. "Which do you like, boys or girls?"</p><p>'Ehhhh?"</p><p></p><p>In the Saotome Dojo, however, things were completely different. It was quiet.</p><p>In the master bedroom, Ranma lay sprawled on the futon, with one arm draped over Akane. The bed covers were thrown back, and they were dressed in boxers and tanks tops due to it being summer and their cursed natures.</p><p>As the predawn light filtered through the open windows Ranma was the first to stir. His brain heard the birds singing in the trees and his eyes flickered open.</p><p>The first thing he saw when his eyes opened was Akane, lying on her side asleep in a tangle of blue -black hair. He lay there, simply watching her for a few minutes as his brain returned to wakefulness.</p><p>"<i>She's so beautiful" </i>was the first coherent thought that went through his brain.</p><p>Blinking twice, and careful not to disturb her, Ranma gently eased himself onto his elbow to watch his wife sleep. Reverently, he traced the soft curves of Akanes face and body with his eyes.</p><p>The years had been very kind to Akane, Ranma mused as he took in his wifes beauty. At forty seven, thanks to the intense training he had given her, Akane had level of trimness and fitness a girl twenty her junior would kill for.</p><p>And her figure was anything but girlish. She had long ago lost the baby fat of her youth, and her having had Christian had did wonders for her figure, in Ranma's unbiased opinion.</p><p>Lost in thought as he was, Ranma almost missed it when her breathing changed and her eyelids flickered as her internal clock told her to 'wake up'. Blinking a couple of times, she looked at Ranma without comprehension for a few moments before her brain kicked into gear.</p><p>"Morning." Ranma said as Akane lifted her head and looked around for the clock.</p><p>"Morning." Akane grunted in reply. "What time is it?"</p><p>"Sunrise." Ranma answered after glancing behind his shoulder.</p><p>Akane's response was to flop over on her back and lay there sprawled as she stared up at the ceiling.</p><p>Ranma stayed where he was, enjoying the new view her doing this afforded him. Her tank top had ridden up, exposing her belly button while her breasts pushed and poked against the fabric of her top.</p><p>As he ogled her, Akane flicked her eyes over and she realized where he was looking. Taking advantage of his distraction, she inhaled and used Ranma's further distraction by her chest expanding to lob a pillow at him.</p><p>"Pervert." she said as Ranma batted the pillow aside easily.</p><p>"I can't help it if you're the most beautiful woman in the world." he said as she pushed herself up into a cross -legged sitting position</p><p>That made a wry grin come to Akanes face. "Even if I'm a tousle -headed tomboy?'' she asked.</p><p>Now it was Ranma's turn to smile. "<i>Especially </i>if you're a tousle -headed tomboy." he replied.</p><p>"You say that to all the girls." Akane shot back as she uncrossed her legs and rolled onto her knees before stretching.</p><p>Ranma laughed at that one. It was an old, inside joke between the two of them, dating back to the insanity of high school and the multiple fiancée 's.</p><p>"And the boys." Ranma added before his hand flashed out and tapped her on the side of the hip, right on a pressure point.</p><p>With a muffled shriek, Akane's legs spasmed and she collapsed forwards, right into the arms of Ranma.</p><p>"Ranma!" Akane hissed, her eyes wide with astonishment. "The kids-!" she continued before Ranma hushed her with a finger on her lips.</p><p>"Lia is on honeymoon, Matoko is over at the bachelor pad, and Christian and Mamimi wont wake up before eight o'clock or breakfast, whichever comes first." he said as his the fingers on his left hand drummed across her lower back in a spidery tap dance, undoing the shiatsu he had performed on her. "So why not enjoy ourselves?" he asked, a familiar mischievous twinkle in his eye.</p><p>Akane laughed lightly as Ranma crossed his arms over her back and hugged her to him. "Pervert." she said as her legs returned to normal.</p><p>"Tomboy." Ranma shot back before her planted a kiss on the end of her nose.</p><p>Akane giggled as her rolled her over onto her back and kneel ed over her . "Now, where do I begin?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>"You're up early."</p><p>Tatewaki's voice cut in over the heavy metal thrashing in her earphones, startling Nabiki out of her reverie. She looked up to see her husband standing over her, a large steaming mug of coffee in hand.</p><p>"More like I'm up late." she said, tugging the ear buds free of her ears as she accepted the coffee.</p><p>Tatewaki nodded as he sat down at his usual place at the table. "And what, pray tell, has kept my lovely wife up all night, making her poor husband thrash about all night and depriving him of his much needed sleep?" he asked.</p><p>Nabiki smiled and rolled her eyes at her husbands aux drama as she took a sip of coffee. "I was thinking about Haruko." she said, putting the mug down. "And how much fun I had with her when we kids."</p><p>"Generally at my expense." Tatewaki interjected before sipping his tea.</p><p>Nabiki nodded, looking down at the Zune laying on the table. "You weren't the only one." she said, tapping the player with a forefinger. "Then I got to thinking about all the crazy things you and I did."</p><p>Tatewaki chuckled. "Ahh, yes. Who could ever forget the Blue Thunder of Katrinka's devotion to the mysterious Pigtailed Girl?" he said with a dramatic flourish. "The first three months alone gave me the material for <i>Neko!</i>"</p><p>Nabiki snorted at Tatewaki's first major hit in the manga world. "True. It has spawned an anime, a best selling collected edition here and in the US, and a astoundingly successful stage production."</p><p>That made Tatewaki laugh and almost choke on his tea. "how true... <i>When do you think I should tell Genma that Old Fart!</i> Is based partially off of him?"</p><p>"After I secure the movie rights." Nabiki said, which got them both laughing.</p><p>Which was cut short by the phone ringing.</p><p>"I got it," Nabiki said, grabbing the cordless handset. Thumbing it on, she put it to her ear. "Moshi Moshi."</p><p>"Nabiki?"</p><p>Nabiki almost dropped the phone is surprise at the voice on the other end, a voice she hadn't heard in years. <i>"Kodachi?"</i> she asked, surprising the hell out of Tatewaki with the mention of his sister's name. "Where the hell are you? Are you at the beach?"</p><p>Kodachi laughed as her brother began to make grabbing motions with his hands. "Close. I'm on my porch.." she said as Nabiki held up a hand in a shushing gesture. "Is my dear brother there?" she asked.</p><p>Nabiki nodded, glancing up at Tatewaki. "Yes, he is. He's sitting at the table with me." she answered. "you want me to hand the phone over to him?"</p><p>"Could you put me speaker?" Kodachi asked. "It's been ages, and I want to talk to the both of you."</p><p>"Sure." Nabiki said, pressing the speaker phone button on the handset and setting it down between her and Tatewaki. "How's that? Can you hear us?"</p><p>"You're coming in loud and clear." Kodachi answered. "How are you brother? Are you still possessed of a golden pen?"</p><p>Tatewaki smiled and nodded at the handset. "I am fine, sister, and my writing skills have been moderately successful at keeping my family fed." he answered. "And how you doing? Are those gymnasts you mentioned medal quality?"</p><p>Half a world away, Kodachi chuckled. "I am doing fine, brother-and there's the possibility of gold in a few of their futures.." she answered. "Though there are days where I am sooo tempted to dust off my recipe book."</p><p>'Oh?" asked Tatewaki with a raised eyebrow. "How come?"</p><p>On the other end of the phone there was the very audible grinding of molars. "It's the bloody parents." she explained. "Overbearing, too much money and too little brain, and they're living vicariously through their children." she added. "The mothers are the worst."</p><p>Nabiki and Tatewaki both thought about the various couples that were parents of Chisu's classmates who fit that description and nodded.</p><p>"I mean, true I <i>was </i>one of those people when I younger, but I <i>did </i>learn my lesson." Kodachi continued. "you have no idea on how tempting it is to just give an obnoxious parent a good dose of paralysis poison when they are getting in your face."</p><p>"There have been days where I wished for my bokken." Tatewaki agreed. "There are few parents I have had the displeasure to know who have been in dire need of a good thrashing."</p><p>Kodachi and her brother shared a laugh at that one.</p><p>"By the way..."Tatewaki asked before taking a sip of his tea. "How is Father doing?" he asked.</p><p>"Oh, he's in high heaven." Kodachi answered. "He's working part time at a tiki barbershop."</p><p>Nabiki and Tatewaki blinked at that one. "A tiki <i>barbershop</i>?" asked Nabiki. "You have got to be kidding me."</p><p>"That sounds like you would find in Nerima" added Tatewaki.</p><p>"That's nothing. You should see one of the local bail bondsmen." Kodachi said. "Dog is one of the more... <i>interesting</i> characters around here."</p><p>Tatewaki arched an eyebrow as he gave Nabiki a sidelong glance. "You make that sound like it's a <i>bad</i> thing, sister." he said.</p><p>"Actually, without him and the other characters around here it would be painfully boring." Kodachi glibly replied. "That, and after work I can head down to the beach and surf."</p><p>Tatewaki and Nabiki's jaws both dropped at that admission from Kodachi.</p><p>"You surf?" asked a surprised Tatewaki.</p><p>"What made you pick up surfing?" asked Nabiki.</p><p>Kodachi gave a full throated laugh. "Well, it's good exercise, I keep up my tan, and most importantly, where else can one pick up surfer boys?"</p><p>Tatewaki did a spit take while Nabiki giggled.</p><p>"Nabiki!" Tatewaki coughed as he looked at his wife, who was giving him a "who, me?" look.</p><p>"What?" Nabiki asked. "You know I have eyes only for you." she pointed out, glancing at the clock.</p><p>Kodachi chuckled over the phone. "You've got a keeper there, brother." she said.</p><p>Tatewaki nodded as Nabiki got to her feet. "That I do, sister." he said. "Where are you going?" he asked.</p><p>"It's time for me to wake Chisu from the dead." answered Nabiki, pointing at the clock.</p><p>"Ah." Tatewaki said as she left.</p><p>Tatewaki and Kodachi began chatting about surfing as Nabiki walked down the hall to Chisu's bedroom and knocked on the door before she opened it. Nabiki's gasp of surprise was drowned out by the dual shrieks of surprise.</p><p>Tatewaki was stunned into silence as Nabiki stammered something and stumbled into the living room. He watched as she sat down and poured herself a cup of tea with a slightly shaking hand.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Tatewaki asked.</p><p>Before answering Nabiki took a gulp of tea and swallowed. "C-Chisu had his girlfriend over." she answered, a bit of a blush coloring her cheeks.</p><p>Tatewaki blinked twice and looked down at his tea. Clearing his throat he spoke. "Well then..." he said. "To paraphrase your sister, oh my..."</p><p>"Indeed." Kodachi said. "You mind if I call you back later?" she asked.</p><p>"Not at all." Tatewaki said, reaching for the phone. "We'll talk to you later."</p><p>"Later." Kodachi said before breaking the connection.</p><p>Putting the phone down Tatewaki took a deep breath and looked up at his wife. "It certainly is shaping up to be an interesting morning, isn't it?" he asked.</p><p>Nabiki's response was give her husband a dirty look over her mug.</p><p></p><p>"So, dear brother, how do you like the twenty first century?"</p><p>Akihito turned from the window, where he had been watching the countryside fly by in fascination, to give his sister an odd look.</p><p>"Say again?" he asked, not understanding what Asako had said.</p><p>Asako giggled at her brothers face. "I asked, what do you think of the twenty first century?" she asked, repeating the question with a smirk and an arched eyebrow.</p><p>Feeling like he was the butt of a joke Akihito crossed his arms as his expression changed from confused to annoyed. "Just <i>what </i>are you talking about?" he asked. "What is this twenty first century you're talking about?"</p><p>Asako giggled again and leaned forwards towards her brother. "It's the new calender." she explained. "We no longer mark time by the year of an Emperor's reign."</p><p>Akihito gave his sister a skeptical look. "I see..." he said, looking around the passenger compartment of the Bentley. "And this... cart?" he asked.</p><p>Asako's smile changed into a knowing smirk as she leaned back into the leather seat of the Bentley. "Ahh... this, this is an automobile." she explained. "A Bentley Arnage RL, to be specific."</p><p>"And that means what, exactly?" Akihito asked.</p><p>"The name of the maker and the model." Asako explained.</p><p>Akihito nodded and sat back into seat. "So, what kind of magic does it use?" he asked.</p><p>"It doesn't use magic." his sister answered. "It's a machine."</p><p>Akihito's eyebrows arched up towards his bangs. "A machine? You're joking."</p><p>Asako shook her head slowly. "Nope." she said. "Humans are quite clever."</p><p>That got a annoyed grumble from her brother. "Don't I know it." he said. "Bloody miko..." he added, getting a giggle from Asako. Scowling, her gave her the evil eye. "What's so funny?" he asked. "You think getting clubbed upside the head is any fun?"</p><p>Smirking Asako eyed her brother. "I was thinking of how you got sealed." she said. "You trying to get her drunk and she was the one who was able to out drink you..." she added, which got a stifled giggle from Jun.</p><p>Asako looked at her apprentice, who was doing her best not to smile and failing terribly, then they looked at Akihito, who was sitting across from them scowling at them.</p><p>"Sure, rub it in..." he groused, turning his attention back to the window and the scenery outside.</p><p>The two kitsune women looked back at each other and then burst out laughing.</p><p>After about a good five minutes of raucous laughter, they had both calmed down to the point where they could speak coherently.</p><p>"Oh, kami, that's funny." Asako said, wiping tears from her eyes as Jun did the same.</p><p>"Yes it was. " agreed Jun as she sat back in her seat and opened her fan. "I needed that." she added, fanning herself.</p><p>Asako nodded as she opened the mini bar "I did too." she said. "Just the thing to loosen one up." she added, pulling out a bottle. "Sake?"</p><p>Jun nodded, and with a bit prodding, Akihito acquiesced as well.</p><p>"To the Nine -Tails." Asako said, raising her cup in a toast.</p><p>"To the Nine -Tails." Akihito and Jun echoed, raising their cups.</p><p>After downing the toast Asako refilled everyones cups and sat back in her seat, sighing contentedly. "Ahhh... Good sake." she said, crossing her legs. "Anyways, enough about the trivialities of the modern world. Did you manage to read the scrolls before you were sealed?"</p><p>Akihito shook his head before taking a sip of his sake. "No, unfortunately." he answered. "However, the situation is not a total loss."</p><p>"In what way?" asked Asako.</p><p>Now it was Akihito's time to give his sister a smug smirk. "Before you came for me I managed to create a situation where there is the possibility that the cat demon would have access to them." he explained, getting a chuckle out of Asako. "Thanks to that little kuonichi I ran into the night I was unsealed."</p><p>"Clever." Asako said, raising her glass in a salute to her brother. "And how did you do that, exactly?"</p><p>Akihito leaned back in his seat, the smirk never leaving his face. "The girl was reading old scrolls into one of their machines, and I kept flirting with her until she wasn't paying close enough attention to what she was doing." he said.</p><p>Asako laughed and poured herself some more sake. "Ahh, pretty girls." she said. "Your biggest strength and greatest weakness, all rolled into one."</p><p>"Yep." Akihito said with a smile, raising his cup again. "To me."</p><p>"To you." Asako replied, raising her cup in a toast.</p><p></p><p>Slipping out the back door, Tomoe carefully looked around the backyard of the Sano household before ghosting across the yard to the guest room. Knowing that her cousin had undoubtedly set traps, she bypassed them by going past the porch and around to the side of the house.</p><p>Tomoe padded down to rear of the building, where the kitchen was. Again, she looked around to check and see if she was being watched, then, ditching her shoes, she jumped and caught the overhanging eave of the roof. Tomoe took a moment to catch her breath before she swung her legs back and forwards.</p><p>Swinging her whole body like a pendulum Tomoe swung her feet up to where the wall met the roof and caught hold of a hidden lip using her toes. Lowering herself down a bit so she could see, she saw the sliding panel that was camouflaged from ground level.</p><p>Using the big toe on her right foot, Tomoe slid the panel open and using a series of hidden handhold's, slid herself in feet first.</p><p>Inside the house, Tomoe quietly pulled herself into a crouch balancing on the balls of her feet, perched on a support beam. Drawing a kunai, she reached down and pried a ceiling panel up and put it to one side. Peeking down to make sure it was clear, she saw that it was and lowered herself down into the small kitchen of the guest house.</p><p>Her feet had just touched the floor when an iron hand grabbed her shoulder and shoved her roughly against the wall. Her hand instinctively reached for a kunai, but stopped when she felt the cold metal of a gun muzzle against the base of her skull.</p><p>"I don't like it when people try to sneak up on me." whispered Naota. "Especially inexperienced people."</p><p>Tomoe swallowed nervously. "N-naota... i-it's me, Tomoe-" she started to whisper before Naota interrupted her.</p><p>"I don't care if you're the Pope." Naota said, his whisper now starting to edge towards menacing. "Why were you trying to sneak up on me?"</p><p>Tomoe gulped, remembering that she was dealing with a jonin. One didn't get to be a jonin by being stupid, after all.</p><p>"N-naota, I got a problem." she whispered.</p><p>"What kind of problem?" Naota asked, his tone unchanging.</p><p>"I- I – I accidentally scanned the Forbidden Scrolls..." Tomoe answered.</p><p>Tomoe felt him press the muzzle of his gun harder into the back of her head. "You did <i>what?</i>" he asked, anger coloring his voice.</p><p>"The Scrolls...the Fox was bored so he was pestering me and I got distracted..." Tomoe answered, squeezing her eyes shut, expecting the worse.</p><p>'I see..." Naota said, calmly.</p><p>Tomoe felt the muzzle of his gun pull away and Naota spun her around to face him. "So you made a mistake." he said, tucking his gun into the back of his waistband.</p><p>Thoroughly confused now, Tomoe nodded. "Y-yeah." she stammered as Naota crossed his arms and stared down at her. "I already deleted them from the computer..." she began before her cousin interrupted her with a scowl.</p><p>"You don't know how to completely erase files, don't you?" he asked, annoyance creeping into his voice. "And you want me to do it."</p><p>Tomoe nodded slightly and mentally willed her knees not to shake. <i>"Mother Mary, he's as scary as Uncle Kamone...</i>" she thought as she looked into her cousin's face.</p><p>Naota grunted slightly under his breath and nodded. "I'll do it." he said. 'But I expect you to know how to do it by the time I leave." he added.</p><p>Tomoe nodded jerkily again and allowed herself to relax slightly as Naota leaned in close to her.</p><p>"But there's a price tag for my help." he said, his face inches from her. "You're going to report this little mistake of yours, but you're to forget to mention my help." He added as Tomoes eyes bugged out.</p><p>"Not tell them about your help- why?" Tomoe whispered.</p><p>"Just another ace in the hole they don't know about." Naota answered her. "And you'll owe me a favor- because you know the elders would be a lot more harsher on you if they knew I -a yokai- helped you."</p><p>"Of course." Tomoe whispered, rolling her eyes. "Politics. I should have known."</p><p>the corner of Naotas mouth quirked upwards into a half smile. "The higher in rank, the deeper it gets." he said, grabbing Tomoe and spinning her around before pulling her close to him. "Now lets go take care of this problem. I'm missing cuddle time with Lia." he added before they sank into the shadows.</p><p>The blackness washed over her for an instant, then fell away to reveal the family's computer room, which was a converted tearoom. Tomoe felt her cousin's hand clamped over her mouth, muffling her surprised yelp.</p><p>They stood there for a moment before Naota spoke.</p><p>"You okay?" he asked. Getting a nod from his cousin he chuckled and removed his hand from her mouth. "Sorry about that." he whispered. "Shadow jumping can be a bit disorienting the first few times."</p><p>"Tell me about it." Tomoe said, her heart pounding in her ears. "Why'd you do it?"</p><p>"No can see us come over here." Naota answered. Seeing the family PC sitting on it's table next to a pile of documents and scrolls, he nodded at it. "That's it , I assume?" he asked.</p><p>'Yeah. You need me to tell you what to look fouuurrrk!" the rest of Tomoes sentence was cut off by Naota putting her into a choke hold.</p><p>"Shhh... it's for your own protection." Naota whispered in her ear as she struggled briefly before going limp.</p><p>He held her for a few moment to check and make sure she wasn't faking, then satisfied she wasn't he gently laid her down on the floor and put a pillow under her head. Stepping over Tomoe, Naota padded to to the computer and with a few keystrokes had recovered the files and sent them to an anonymous account.</p><p>It took him only a few moments to hide his tracks, then he melted back into the shadows and back into the arms of Lia moments before Tomoe came to.</p><p></p><p>Kamone looked up as the bells above the door jingled, and was surprised to see Takata of all people walking in the door.</p><p>"Takata!" he said, straightening up. "What brings you down here?"</p><p>"I just happened to be in the neighborhood, and thought I'd drop by." Takata said with a shrug before glancing behind him. "Come on in kids, he won't bite." he said, motioning to whoever was behind him.</p><p>Curious, leaned over to one side as the bells jingled again and two children cam in, a boy and a girl. By Kamone's mental estimate, they were about seven or eight, with the daughter being the older of the two. They both took after their father, being skinny and gangly, so Kamone mentally revised his estimate by a couple of years.</p><p>"And who are these two?" Kamone asked, the goofy father in him coming to the fore.</p><p>"This is Ai," Takata said, patting his daughter on the back "And this is Honzo." he added, patting his son on the back. "kids, I'd like you to meet a friend of your uncle and I's, Kamone Sano."</p><p>"Hello Sano -san." Ai and Honzo said, bowing to Kamone.</p><p>"Hello." Kamone said, returning their bow. "And welcome to my humble shop." he added.</p><p>Clearing his throat Takata spoke. "Speaking of their uncle, is he around?" he asked.</p><p>Kamones face split into a grin that for some reason reminded Takata of Asako, and the main reason why he was here.</p><p>"As a matter of fact, he is!" Kamone said. "And so is his friend. They're out back having tea with Dad and Bre. I'm sure he'd love to see his niece and nephew." he added, stepping around the counter to open the pass through for them.</p><p>Ai and Honzo looked up at their father for approval and he gave them a nod. Following behind them he tried to place the name 'Bre' before. As he navigated them through the back of the shop through the machinery he spotted a guitar pick lying incongruously on a table and thats when he remembered who Bre was: Naotas sister.</p><p>Mentally kicking himself, he opened the door to the area that the Sanos used as a combination break room/storeroom and ushered his children in.</p><p>Inside the breakroom sat Kenji and Dokuhotei, playing shogi while Bre and Matoko sat off to the side and conversed.</p><p>"hey, String bean" Takata said as he came in. "Look who I brought."</p><p>"huh?" Startled, Kenji blinked and looked up. His eyes got wide when he saw who was accompanying his brother. "Oh my."</p><p>"Hello." Dokuhotei said, turning in his seat to meet the children, shogi momentarily forgotten. "And who might you two be?" he asked as Bre and Matoko came over.</p><p>There was an awkward silence as both of the children shied back from Dokuhotei, which didn't surprise Takata at all. Ai and Honzo had always been very perceptive about people, and for all of his charm and general goofiness, Dokuhotei was a very dangerous man.</p><p>"Ah, Kenji, why don't you and the girls take them out for some ice cream?" Takata suggested, breaking the silence.</p><p>"huh -oh. Sure!" Kenji said,glancing back at Matoko. "What do you think, Matoko?" he asked.</p><p>Matoko gave him a gentle smile and nodded slightly. "I'd love to." she said. "There's a new pistachio nut flavor that I've been wanting to try for a while."</p><p>Bre's stomach gave a hungry rumble, to which she could only grin sheepishly. "I guess I don't have much choice in the matter." she said.</p><p>Takata stood aside as the party left the room, with Kamone following. "I'll be watching the front." he said before closing the door behind him.</p><p>Dokuhotei listened until he hear the bells above the door jangle, then looked at Takata. "So." he said, motioning to the seat recently vacated by Kenji. "What brings you here? It's not for a social visit."</p><p>Takata shrugged and sat down. "It's my wife." he said looking down at the board, analyzing the layout of the pieces.</p><p>"What about her?" asked Dokuhotei, gazing at the board. "It's your move." he added.</p><p>Takata glanced up at Dokuhotei for a moment, then focused on the board. "I want a divorce." he answered as he moved a piece.</p><p>Dokuhotei watched Takata move the piece he had selected, then arched an eyebrow. Interesting.</p><p>"I'm a devout Catholic." he said, moving one of his pieces so it potentially threatened two of Takatas. "We aren't exactly regular customers of divorce lawyers." he added. "And my services aren't exactly recommended for use as an alternate to going through the courts."</p><p>Takata narrowed his eyes as he studied the board. "Actually, I was hoping you could assist me with the courts." he said, not falling for the trap Dokuhotei had laid for him and moving a different piece.</p><p>Dokuhotei was surprised, Takata normally didn't show this level of tactical aptitude. "Assist you in what way?" he asked, contemplating the board.</p><p>Takata sat back and crossed his arms as he waited for Dokuhotei to make his next move. "I was hoping you could talk to my wifes lawyers and the judge on my behalf, make them see my point of view." he explained.</p><p>"I see." Dokuhotei said, running scenarios through his head. "That we would be more than capable of helping you with." he said, stroking his chin. "Though this is something that is more than just a favor, you do realize that?"</p><p>Takata nodded and fished around in his jacket pocket. 'I know." he said. 'My father in law is the President of Megatech Cybernetics Incorporated." he added, pulling out a USB key and sliding it over to him. "I'm sure he would be most grateful for keeping this quiet and out of the media."</p><p>'Really." Dokuhotei said as he caught the key. "Whats this?"</p><p>"Files." Takata said. "Of projects that Megatech is working on. Including full-body replacement."</p><p>Dokuhotei looked up in surprise at Takata. "You're joking." he asked. "The government is years away from approving cybernetic prosthesis."</p><p>Takata smiled. "Nope." he said. "I have a friend who has an inside line to MITI. They're fast tracking approval." he added putting his hands behind his head. "Within the next year and a half, it'll be approved."</p><p>Twirling the USB key in his fingers Dokuhotei gave Takata a shrewed look. "How?" he asked. "How did they manage that?"</p><p>'Easy." Takata answered. "They agreed to give the government all the bleeding edge stuff- hardware, software, etc."</p><p>Dokuhotei nodded, looking back at the board. Outside he was calm, but inside his mind was racing. There had been lots of rumors flying around about the government approving cybernetics, but the Hagakure didn't have any sources with access to the information that could prove it.</p><p>One of the rumors had said that Megatech was one of the companies on the shortlist to receive approval, and Takata had walked in and confirmed the rumors that they had been hearing -with the kicker giving the cal access to the head of the company.</p><p>Sighing, Dokuhotei looked up at Takata. "Checkmate." he said. "You win."</p><p>Takata chuckled and bowed to Dokuhotei. "Thank you." he said. "Do we have a deal?"</p><p>Dokuhotei smiled and nodded. "Oh, yes, Takata." he said. "We most certainly do."</p><p></p><p>Kenji looked up as Ai sat down next to him on the curb. She glanced up at him momentarily, then looked back down at her cone. He looked back at his own cone for a moment, feeling slightly uncomfortable.</p><p>Chewing on his lip for a few moments he looked back to his niece. "S- so." he stammered. "What did you get?"</p><p>Ai licked her lips and looked up at her uncle. "Mint..." she said quietly.</p><p>Kenji nodded. "I got mocha chino." he said. Ai nodded and they licked their cones for a few minutes before Kenji spoke again. "I heard you like to draw." he said.</p><p>Ai looked up at her uncle with a somewhat surprised look on her face. "Y-yeah." she said. "Daddy mentioned that you're a manga -ka."</p><p>"I am." Kenji said. "Matoko is my writer." he added, nodding where Matoko and Bre were fussing over Honzo.</p><p>Ai looked at Matoko for a few moments. "She's pretty." she commented.</p><p>"Thank you." Kenji said as Ai looked back to him.</p><p>"She's your girlfriend." Ai said, her tone stating that it was a fact.</p><p>"Yeah." Kenji replied. "You're very observant."</p><p>His niece looked down at her cone and took a lick of it. "Daddy says that a lot about me." she said. "He's very proud of it."</p><p>"He said you're the best thing that ever happened to him." Kenji said. "You and Honzo are the light of his life."</p><p>Ai nodded and licked her cone a couple of more times. "I think Daddy and Mommy are going to get a divorce." she said suddenly, making Kenji almost choke on his ice cream.</p><p>Coughing a couple of times, Kenji cleared his throat and looked at Ai. "How did you know that?" he said, not even trying to hide the question.</p><p>"They've been arguing a lot." Ai said. "And Mom's started going out a lot without dad."</p><p>Kenji blinked a couple of times and gave his niece a long look. "You don't sound too unhappy about your parents breaking up." he said cautiously.</p><p>Ai shrugged and licked her cone. "I think we're more of an inconvenience for Mom." she said. "I know Daddy would rather be with us."</p><p>Kenji chewed his lip for a few moments before nodding again. "Well..." he said "At least your father has his priorities right."</p><p>"Yeah." she said. "I hope we get to go with Daddy when it comes."</p><p>"I hope so too." Kenji said. "I'd like to get to know you and your brother better."</p><p>Ai 'hmmed' and went back to her cone. She and Kenji finished their cones and waited for her brother and the girls to finish up with theirs. As they waited Kenji nudged Ai with his arm.</p><p>"Hey." Kenji said. "You mind if I see your work?" he asked.</p><p>'I- I didn't bring anything with me..." stammered Ai, but Kenji held up his hand.</p><p>"I have plenty of paper." he said. "And pencils."</p><p>"Oh." Ai said. "I guess I wouldn't mind then."</p><p>Kenji nodded as Matoko came over with Honzo and Bre.</p><p>"Hey, Kenji." Bre said "Did you know Honzo here is a Quake fan?" she added.</p><p>Kenji and Ai turned to face Honzo. "Really?" he asked, getting a nod from both his nephew and Bre.</p><p>"Yeah." she said. "He says he's really good." Bre added. "In fact, he said he could beat He who Ownz." Honzo punctuated with a nod.</p><p>"Oh." Kenji said, a smile on his face. "Ai was going to show me how good of an artist she is, so I think we should head over to the apartment." he added.</p><p>"Good idea." Bre said, trading a knowing look with Kenji. Behind her, Matoko looked lost in thought -obviously the exchange had sparked her imagination and she was daydreaming.</p><p>Grabbing the now daydreaming Matoko, Bre followed Kenji as they went back the way they came and headed for the apartment.</p><p></p><p>The early afternoon sun lit the study with a golden glow as The Ninetails, Kyuubi Kawashima leaned back in his chair and pondered. Like all kitsunes, he was pondering mischief and mayhem, but it was all secondary to what was foremost on his mind: the Forbidden Scrolls of the Hagakure Clan.</p><p>He had gotten an email from Aki Dazi forty -five minutes earlier, reporting what he had overheard of Akihito and Asako's conversation. That his son had been unsuccessful in obtaining the scrolls, he had taken that for a given. The Hagakure were simply too good to allow anyone near the scrolls.</p><p>Sending his son into the clans territory had simply been to probe their defenses and get an idea of what he was up against. He just hadn't expected them to be that good, otherwise he would have sent a more powerful fox.</p><p>The reason Kyuubi had sent Akihito in to retrieve the scrolls hadn't been to increase his power- far from it. Kyuubi already knew all the techniques listed on the scrolls. The reason he had sent Akihito in to retrieve the scrolls had been to keep them from falling into the hands of a weaker demon and upsetting the balance of power.</p><p>Which, if what Aki had said in his email was correct, had just happened. Naota Sano, a young tai -yokai with the potential to become equal in power to Sheshy -poo and himself, had just gone from a minor unknown entity to a full blown threat to the status quo.</p><p>What worried Kyuubi about that wasn't how Sheshy -poo would react to this- he would react with his usual cold logic, resorting to violence only if Naota proved to be a threat to him or his lands. No, what worried Kyuubi was how all the other, lower powered demons would react.</p><p>There was a spiders web of alliances and favors all over the yokai community of Japan, and the slightest shift could cause a full blown war to ignite. And Kyuubi knew if that happened, it would be only a matter of time before the humans noticed, no matter how good a job the T.P.C.D did covering it up.</p><p>And when that happened, Kyuubi knew it would be all over. For no matter how powerful he and his fellow yokai may be, there was no way they could withstand over six billion humans.</p><p>Sighing, he began to drum his finger on his desk. There was no way he could prevent this from getting out indefinitely, for Naota would make his presence know once he started to increase in power. But, for now, he could keep it contained to give him some time while he pursued other options.</p><p>Yes, that would work.</p><p>Reaching over, he pressed the intercom on his desk. "Miss Kadiri." he said.</p><p>"Yeah boss?" his secretary answered over the intercom.</p><p>"When my son arrives, have everyone in the car come up to meet me." Kyuubi told her. "And tell them they are not to talk to anyone either."</p><p>"Sure thing boss." Kadiri said before Kyuubi broke the connection.</p><p></p><p>End. (finally!)</p><p>Authors note: Okay, first things first. I know it's been a looong -assed time since I last updated. I have a lot of reasons for this, among them writers block lasting over a year (arrrrrrrrgh), getting distracted by some side projects of mine, becoming addicted to blogs, becoming addicted to 4chan's /tg/ board, and completely rewriting the plot for the remainder of this series.</p><p>Plus the fact that I've gone through three jobs since I last updated and it's damn hard to think about story development when you're worried about if you are going to find a job before the rent comes due.</p><p>Whew!</p><p>That being said, I feel I'm back on track and will start trying to post regularly from now on, even if it's nothing more than little page and a half updates.</p><p>Thank you for your patience, and not hunting me down and lynching me.</p><p>Zombie Boy.</p>
