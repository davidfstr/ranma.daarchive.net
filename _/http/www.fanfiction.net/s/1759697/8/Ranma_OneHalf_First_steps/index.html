</div>Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Chapter eight.<p>Kasumi paused in her preparing lunch and looked up. She could swear that she was being watched. She looked all around the kitchen and even checked the doors and window but there was no one there.<p>Shrugging it off Kasumi went to the refrigerator and took out some condiments. Closing the door she looked up at the top of the refrigerator and found herself looking into a pair of incredibly blue eyes.<p>"Oh!" Kasumi said as she took a step back. "Bad kitty, spying on me like that!" Kasumi admonished, shaking her finger.<p>Thor simply blinked at her and licked his paw. Putting the condiments on the counter Kasumi reached up and scratched him behind the ears.<p>"You really shouldn't scare me like that." she told him as he began to purr. "I'll fix you something in a bit." Kasumi added.<p>Taking lunch in on a tray Kasumi found Ranma and her sister sitting at the family computer and Lia curled up in a patch of sun, apparently asleep.<p>"Lia certainly lives up to her nickname." Kasumi thought as she placed the tray on the table. "Lunchtime!" she called.<p>Kasumi could've sworn that the three of them teleported, they moved so fast. She blinked in surprise and fell back onto her rear. Kasumi expected Ranma and Lia to do that being Saotomes, but Akane?<p>"Oh my, Akane..." Kasumi murmured.<p>"Eh?" Akane said, looking up.<p>"You startled me." Kasumi said as she got back up.<p>"Oh, sorry about that Kasumi. When you generate chi like I do you tend to develop a healthy appetite." Akane said as Kasumi began to dish up.<p>"I suppose so." Kasumi said as she passed a bowl of rice to Lia. Glancing at the computer she saw that they had Google up. "And what are you looking for?" she asked.<p>"Ukyos father." Ranma said as he picked up the soy sauce. "We're gonna get him and Pop to dissolve the agreement." he said.<p>"How are you going to do that?"Kasumi asked. Akane gave her sister a smile. "Why, we're going to ask nicely of course." she said.<p>"Oh my..." Kasumi said to herself. _ _ _<p>Dawn was hinting at the eastern horizon as the man began to set up his cart. He began to set up the ingredients that he would be needing and set out the utensils he would be using. Moving with a deceptive ease he quickly set everything in its place.<p>He was kneeling down to start the fire to heat up the griddle when he heard footsteps behind him.<p>"Mr. Kuonji?" a woman asked behind him.<p>He turned around to find a woman in baggy jeans and t-shirt looking at him in the predawn light.<p>"Yes, that's me. Can I help you miss?" he asked.<p>"Yes. You are the father of Ukyo Kuonji, correct?" she asked.<p>"Yeah, I am her father. But I haven't seen her in years if your looking for her." he said, feeling slightly suspicious.<p>"Oh, I know where she is Mr. Kuonji. I was looking for you." she said.<p>"I see. And may I ask, who are you and what do you want?" he asked her.<p>"I am Akane and I am here to tell you that the marriage contract you have your daughter in needs to be dissolved." she said matter -of -factly.<p>"Really." Mr. Kuonji said as he reached for his battle spatula. "But I think you should be going now, girl." he said as he drew.<p>Akane sighed as she stepped forward. "I tried asking nicely..." she said to herself.<p>"Big mistake, girl." Kuonji growled as he swung at her.<p>Only to have her disappear as his swing hit empty air. It had barely registered on his brain when a freight train hit him the stomach and knocked him ass over teakettle. Kuonji was lying on the ground trying to keep from throwing up when Akane appeared over him holding his battle spatula.<p>"Now I see where Ukyo gets her thick skull." Akane said as she knelt down by him.<p>"What do you think you're doing?" Kuonji wheezed. "Tying you up of course. You think I'm going to let you get away?" she asked.<p>"Huh?" he asked.<p>Akane then proceeded hog tie Mr. Kuonji with his own battle spatula. After making sure he was securely tied she tossed him onto his cart and hauled him off whistling a happy tune.<p>At the same time Akane was introducing herself to Mr. Kuonji Ranma was roof hopping across Nerima towards Ukyos. As he neared her restaurant he saw that the windows were dark, showing that no one was up yet.<p>Invoking the Umi -Sen -Ken he landed silently in front of the restrain. Silently he jumped to the roof. Sneaking across the roof he went to the door to the roof and checked the lock. Testing it he found it locked. Swiping his finger along the seam of the door and the frame he cut the bolt and let himself in.<p>He quietly eased his way down the stairs, checking each one before putting his weight on it. Reaching the hall he stayed close to the wall as he cat footed his way to Ukyos bedroom. He quietly eased the door open and slipped inside.<p>Ranma crouched down next to the wall and waited. His wait was not long as Ukyos alarm clock went off. Smacking it with her hand she turned it off and lay there for a moment. Rubbing her eyes she threw the blankets off and got up.<p>As she shuffled towards the door on her way to the bathroom Ranma made his move. Slipping behind Ukyo he tapped a few pressure points and she was out like a light. Catching her as she fell Ranma then laid her down on the futon and tied her up.<p>When he was finished he tossed her over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes and made his way out. _ _ _<p>Ukyo awoke two hours later and found herself looking at a strange ceiling.<p>"That's not my ceiling." she thought as she looked up at it. "Where am I anyways?" she asked herself as she looked around.<p>As she took in the decor Ukyos sleep addled brain finally recognized where she was.<p>"Why am I at the Tendos?" she asked aloud. "And why am I tied up?" she added after trying to move her arms.<p>Ukyo tested her bonds and found them to be quite secure. Frowning she gave the room another once over and found that the only other occupant was a large cat sitting on the table giving her an amused look.<p>"I get my hands on whatever jackass tied me up they are gonna pay." Ukyo said aloud, hoping her captor was listening.<p>The sounds of the house creaking was her only answer. Banging her head against the pillow in frustration Ukyo sighed.<p>"Shit. I shouldn't have had those shots before bed." Ukyo muttered to herself. "I wonder who kidnaped me." Ukyo asked.<p>Looking around the room again she glanced at the cat.<p>"Or when they're gonna get back." she said.<p>Her wait didn't prove to be long because soon the sound of a cart rolling up could be heard. Ukyo tracked the sound as the cart came to a stop and something was unloaded from it. There were heavy footsteps along the porch and then a shadow was thrown on the screen showing an absurdly large figure.<p>Ukyo tensed for anything when the screen opened and revealed a large man slung over the shoulder of a much smaller person. Ukyo was wondering just what was going on when the man was unceremoniously dropped on the floor next to her.<p>Getting a look at the mans face Ukyo was shocked to see that it was her father.<p>"Dad?" she exclaimed.<p>Not getting an answer she looked at the person who brought him in and got her second shock of the day.<p>"AKANE!" Ukyo shrieked.<p>"Nice to see you too, Ukyo." Akane said as she winced at the volume.<p>Ukyos scowled as she looked at Akane.<p>"What the hell is going on!" Ukyo demanded. "Why have you kidnaped me and my father?" she continued.<p>Akane crossed her arms and looked down at Ukyo. "We're just taking care of something that should have been solved years ago." Akane told her.<p>"The hell you are! Ranmas mine, dammit!" Ukyo snarled. "Now let me go or you'll end up regretting it you stupid hermaphrodite!" she added. Akanes right eye twitched at the insult as it struck a nerve. Ukyo grinned at Akanes reaction. Uncrossing her arms Akane stepped forward.<p>"Ooh, struck a nerve did I?" Ukyo said with a smirk. "The truth hurts, don't it Aka- aaah!" Ukyo said as Akane grabbed her shirtfront an hauled her to her feet.<p>"Seeing as how you bombed my wedding Ukyo I wouldn't go throwing insults." Akane said, putting her face in Ukyos. "And don't forget it was you and the Chinese Bimbo who crashed the party and caused me to get cursed." she added, shaking her like a rag doll.<p>Dropping Ukyo on her butt Akane stood over her and put her hands on her hips as she looked down at her.<p>"So unless you want to get pounded keep quiet." she said.<p>Sitting on the floor Ukyo kept quiet as she stared back up at Akane.<p>"Good." Akane said with a nod. Walking over to the table she down and began to pet the cat. "I wonder where Ranma is." she asked him.<p>Thor simply blinked at her and rolled over into a more comfortable position. As Akane began to scratch his ears she saw that he was lying on a note. Pulling it out she read it.<p>Akane,<p>Took Lia with me to retrieve the panda. Be back soon.<p>Ranma.<p>Putting the note down Akane went back to petting Thor. Her wait was not long as soon Ranmas and Lias arrival was heralded by the arrival of a panda face first in the yard.<p>"What the-?" Ukyo exclaimed. "What was that?"<p>"Panda." Akane told her.<p>"Huh? Oh." Ukyo said as she saw a furry black and white butt in the clearing dust.<p>"Honestly Pops, a man your age acting like that." Ranma said as he landed on the top of the wall with Lia. "It's ridiculous." he continued.<p>Getting a twitch in response Ranma hopped down from the wall with Lia. Walking over to the panda Ranma looked into the crater and shook his head.<p>"And doing the crouch of the wild tiger as a panda is pathetic." he added. Still shaking his head he walked into the house with Lia. Kicking off their shoes they stepped inside. Ukyo stared at them in shock.<p>"R- Ranma?" she asked.<p>He nodded. "Yep, that's me." he said.<p>"Daddy, who's this?" Lia asked as she sat down and looked at Ukyo.<p>"That's Ukyo, Kitten. She's one of the people we told you about." he said. "And use Japanese, it's not polite to talk about people in another language." he added.<p>"Okay Daddy." she said, switching to Japanese. "So is she the crazy spatula lady?" Lia asked, poking Ukyo in the foot.<p>"Uh -huh." Akane confirmed.<p>"Okay." Lia said as she got up. Walking back to the porch she sat down and waited for Mr. Panda to wake up.<p>"That's- that's -that's-"Ukyo stuttered as she stared at Lia.<p>"Lia. Our daughter." Ranma told her.<p>Ukyo cocked her head to one side as she looked at Lia. "She sounds like an American." she said.<p>"She is an American." Ranma said as he sat down. "That where she was born and raised." he explained.<p>Ukyo twisted around to look at Ranma. "You were in America?" she asked.<p>Ranma nodded. Ukyo rolled her eyes and flopped back on the futon.<p>"Arrg! I turned Japan upside down looking for you!" she said as she flopped back.<p>"I bet you did. That's why we went to America, Ukyo. I wanted to train Akane without interference." he said with a smile.<p>"Arrrg..." groaned Ukyo.<p>Akane chuckled as she got up from the table to go make tea. Ranma watched her go, then glanced outside. He saw the panda push itself upright and shake its head. As the small cloud of dust it created dissipated Genma gave Ranma an irritated look.<p>"Back among the living, eh Pops?" Ranma asked. Shut up boy flip What's the idea of getting me up so early in the morning? he asked.<p>Ranma jerked his thumb at Ukyo and her father, who was beginning to rouse.<p>"So you could fix a problem you caused a long time ago, Pops." Ranma told his father.<p>Seeing Mr Kuonji and Ukyo Genma quivered and turned to run, but discovered that he had an eight -year -old redhead attached to his leg. Ranma smirked as he got up and stepped outside.<p>"Sorry Pops, but you ain't gonna weasel out of this one." he said as he stepped off the porch.<p>Pulling Lia off Genma Ranma punted him into the house.<p>"Hey!" Lia said as she squirmed, trying to get free.<p>"You can play with the panda in a bit. Why don't you go practice." he told her as he put Lia down.<p>"Okay. Tell me when you're done." she said as she bounded off.<p>"The dojo, not the roof!" Ranma called after her.<p>"Aw, man! I cant have any fun." Lia said as she walked to the dojo.<p>Chuckling Ranma went back into the house. Inside Akane had brought in the tea and was untying Mr. Kuonji.<p>"Now try to be nice and I wont tie you up again." Akane was telling him as Ranma came in.<p>Sitting down he poured himself a cup of tea and waited until Akane was done untying Ukyo and her father and had sat down before speaking.<p>"I can imagine you're wondering whats going on." Ranma began.<p>"Something like that." growled Mr. Kuonji.<p>"Well, it's because of the marriage contract between your daughter and me." Ranma said as he glanced at his father who was still a panda. "It has to be dissolved." he said with a frown.<p>"So she said." Kuonji said as he pointed to Akane. "But she never gave me reason why." he added.<p>Ranma took a sip of his tea before answering. "Well, there is a very good reason why the contract should be dissolved." Ranma said.<p>"And that is?" Kuonji asked.<p>Ranma put his arm around Akane.<p>"She is my wife." he said.<p>"Hmpf!" snorted Kuonji snorted as he put his hand on the table. "The contract takes precedence. You either marry my daughter or forfeit what little honor you have left." he said.<p>Ranmas mouth quirked up into a smile at Kuonjis statement.<p>"Mr Kuonji, I've found 'honor' is nothing more than a shit-faced lie used to control people." Ranma said evenly. "So don't even try it with me." he said, taking off his sunglasses.<p>"I should have known. Like father like son..." Kuonji trailed off as Ranma gave him the full force of his feline gaze.<p>"Like I said: You are going to dissolve the contract." Ranma said.<p>Kuonji chuckled and crossed his arms.<p>"And how am I going to do that? I'm going to need your father to do that and all I see is you, your wife, and your pet panda." he said. "And even if you do manage to produce your father, what incentive do I have?" he asked smugly.<p>Ranma gave him a predatory grin. "Well, first that's not our pet panda." he said as he picked up the teapot. "That's my father." he said as he splashed Genma with the contents.<p>Mr. Kuonjis jaw went slack when he saw the panda that had been sitting there turn into a fat man wearing a gi. Getting up Ranma went over to where Kuonjis bent up battle spatula were lying. Picking it up he turned to the table.<p>"And as for incentive, you two either dissolve the contract..." he said as he tossed the spatula in the air.<p>The Kuonjis and Genma watched as the battle spatula twisted in the air and Ranmas hands blurred, reducing the steel to fine wire. As the silver threads fell to the table he put his hands on his hips and grinned at them.<p>"or else." he finished.<p>The Kuonjis and Genma swallowed nervously. Fighting the urge to bolt and run, Genma turned to Kuonji and smiled nervously. Clearing his throat he spoke nervously.<p>"I think we should do as he says, don't you think?" he asked with a tremor in his voice. Kuonji nodded with enthusiasm. "Ah, yes. Especially since he asked so nicely." he answered.<p>Nodding in agreement Genma extended his hand and Kuonji shook it.<p>"It's agreed then. The marriage contract is hereby dissolved." Genma said with as much pomp as he could muster.<p>"There. That wasn't so hard, was it?" Ranma asked as he crossed his arms.<p>"No, it wasn't." Genma said as he turned to Ranma. "Can we go now?" he asked.<p>"Yeah. You can go." Ranma said with a nod.<p>Kuonji disappeared as if teleported and Genma was right behind him. He had barely made it to the top of the wall when a passing courier with a tank of archer fish passed by and he changed back into panda.<p>Ranma watched as he was instantly bowled over by Lia. Glancing over at Ukyo he saw that she was in shock.<p>"It's over..." she said dumbly, not believing what she had heard.<p>"You okay?" Ranma asked her.<p>Nodding her head absently Ukyo got up and wandered out of the house. Ranma and Akane watched her wander into the wall a few times before she found the gate and left.<p>"That was easy." Akane said as Ukyo left.<p>"Yep." Ranma answered.<p>"Now what do we do?" Akane asked.<p>"That's easy. Clean up." Ranma answered, pointing to the mess that had been made.<p>"Oy." Akane said. _ _ _<p>Kasumi hummed as she chopped vegetables for dinner. Rice was cooking on the stove and the sauce was on a low simmer. Finishing with the vegetables she put them in the pan and then washed her hands.<p>Going over to the refrigerator she took out the fish and went over to the cutting board. Hearing a sudden meow from the top of the refrigerator she looked up and smiled. "Don't worry Thor, I have some for you." she said with a smile.<p>As she cut up the fish she took a portion and put it on a saucer. Putting it on top of the refrigerator and went back to her cooking. Hearing the loud and happy purrs coming from the top of the refrigerator Kasumi smiled again.<p>"Why am I in the Tendo Dojo?" came a voice from the living room.<p>"Hello Ryoga." Kasumi called out as she turned down the stove. "Sit down and I'll bring you some tea." she added.<p>Pouring some tea Kasumi put it on the tray along with some cookies. Coming into the living room Kasumi wondered if she should tell him that Akane and Ranma had returned.<p>"No, I'll let it be a surprise." she thought as she put the tray down in front of Ryoga.<p>"Would you like to stay for dinner Ryoga?" she asked.<p>Ryoga looked up at her in surprise. Blinking he swallowed nervously before responding.<p>"Y-y-yes, thank you." he said.<p>"Alright then. I'll set an extra place." she said with a smile.<p>"Such a shy boy..." Kasumi thought as she went back inside.<p>Outside Ranma, Akane, and Lia were approaching the gate. Returning home from doing the weeks shopping for Kasumi they were preoccupied with what they had seen of Nerima. As Lia bounded off to go play they entered the mud room and took off their shoes. Spotting Ryogas pack in a corner Ranma couldn't resist a chance for some mischief.<p>"Hey Akane, look." Ranma said as she elbowed Akane in the ribs.<p>"Huh-oh, Ryogas here." Akane said as he spotted the pack.<p>"Yeah, I know." Ranma said with a grin.<p>Seeing the gleam in Ranmas eye Akane immediately knew she was up to something. Narrowing his eyes Akane looked at Ranma.<p>"What are you plotting Ranma?" he asked.<p>"Ryoga hasn't seen your cursed form." Ranma said. "And?..." Akane asked.<p>"Lets see if he can put two and two together." Ranma explained as she picked up the bags she had been carrying.<p>Akane frowned at Ranma as he picked up his share of the bags. "I'm not going to play a trick on Ryoga, Ranma." he said.<p>Ranma gave Akane her an innocent expression that he didn't believe for a second.<p>"It wont be a trick. You'll just be showing him your curse." Ranma said. Shrugging she continued. "Besides, you forgot to put a thermos out."<p>"Huh? Ack!" Akane said as he saw that Ranma was right. Giving Ranma a dirty look he followed her into the house. "I think you did that on purpose." Akane muttered.<p>"Who, me?" Ranma asked with a shocked expression.<p>"Shaddup." Akane growled.<p>Ryoga looked up as he heard a male voice that wasn't part of the household. He was wondering who that was when a short, large chested redhead walked into the living room with bags of groceries in each arm.<p>"RANMA!" Ryoga cried, nearly dropping his tea.<p>"Oh, hi Ryoga. Long time no see." Ranma said nonchalantly as she headed to the kitchen.<p>"Where have you been? And where is Akane?" Ryoga asked as he stood up.<p>"Nice to see you too." Ranma said as she walked past him. "Akanes right behind me." she said as she passed.<p>Looking at the doorway all Ryoga saw was a man about thirty or so, with long hair in a ponytail and holding grocery bags. Scowling he turned around and grabbed Ranmas pigtail.<p>"Hey!" she said as she tilted back.<p>"Don't try to play tricks Ranma, that is not Akane!" Ryoga growled.<p>"I'm not playing tricks Ryoga." Ranma said seriously.<p>"Bull! You're up to something, you always are." Ryoga said as he spun Ranma around. "And I'm going to figure it out what it is!" he said.<p>Ranma gave Ryoga a deadpan look as Kasumi stepped into the living room from the kitchen.<p>"Well, then you're in for a long search cause I'm not." Ranma said.<p>"Uh- huh. And besides..." Ryoga said, crossing his arms with a smirk "...I never thought you'd be into guys." he said with a chuckle.<p>Akane, who had been just listening at this point let loose a giggle at that one. Ryoga turned and gave Akane an odd look.<p>"What's with you?" he asked, unsure of whether to run or beat the freak into paste.<p>"S-sorry Ryoga, it's just you saying that Ranmas into guys..." Akane said.<p>Ryoga scowled at Akane.<p>"Do I know you?" he asked.<p>"Yes, actually I'm..."Akane began, then thought better of it. "Hold on, let me show you." He said as he walked over to the table.<p>Walking over to the table Akane put the groceries on the table and refilled the teacup. Straitening up Akane held the teacup over himself.<p>"Watch." he said, then upended the teacup over his head.<p>Ryogas eyes bugged out as the stranger shifted and shrank, turning into Akane. His jaw dropped open as he was rendered speechless.<p>"Ah-ah-ah-..." was all Ryoga could say.<p>"Don't you remember Ryoga? Akane was splashed with the last batch of water from the Spring of Drowned Man when Ranma turned eighteen." Kasumi reminded him.<p>Ryogas face twitched as he digested that information.<p>"Ranma... You-you-you..." Ryoga began. Turning around he gave Ranma a murderous glare. "You-you...YOU STOLE MY CURE!" he bellowed.<p>Ranma blinked in surprise at Ryogas outburst while Akane wondered at what he meant by that. Clenching his fists he began to manifest a fitful battle aura.<p>"Now... NOW I'M DOOMED TO TURN INTO P-CHAN FOREVER!"he bellowed.<p>Ranma winced. "Ryoga, you dumbass." she groaned. Taking off her shades Ranma looked Ryoga in the eye. "You just blew your own secret." she told him.<p>Ryoga stared at Ranmas cats eyes for a couple of moments until what Ranma said registered. Remembering what he had said Ryoga turned around to face Akane.<p>"Akane I can explain..." he started, but stopped.<p>"Ryyyy...Ooooohhhh...Gahhhhh..." Akane growled.<p>Akanes pupils had disappeared and she was glowing a bright, angry, red. Her ponytail had come undone and her hair was wreathing around like Medusas snakes. Books and china were rattling from the sheer power of her chi and she was levitating a couple of centimeters off the floor.<p>Now Akane had developed a very good control of her temper over the years, to the point of where it took a lot to ger her angry. Normally most things that had set her off in the past didn't affect her anymore. What Ryoga had did however was put her into Doomsday mode. Her control had as much chance against that as a sand castle has against a hydrogen bomb.<p>Realizing that he had a thoroughly pissed off Akane facing him Ryogas survival instincts kicked in but they were far too late. Ryoga stepped back as he got ready to run but Akane simply appeared in front of him.<p>"Urk!" was all Ryoga could say.<p>Hauling back, Akane delivered a slap across Ryogas face that knocked out of the house and across the yard into the wall. As he fell limply from the hole in the wall Akane appeared in front of him. Dumbly he stared up at Akane as she reached for him.<p>In the house Ranma saw Akane bend down to prone Ryoga and realized what she was going to do. Putting her hands over her ears Ranma looked at Kasumi.<p>"You'll want to cover your ears. It's gonna get loud." she said.<p>Kasumi wondered what Ranma was talking about as she covered her ears. She found out as Akane began to turn Ryoga into human origami. For fifteen minutes inhuman screams echoed off the buildings in Nerima as glass shattered and people and animals hid in terror.<p>When Akane was done the silence came crashing in like a tidal wave. Stomping past Ranma and Kasumi she headed to the dojo.<p>"I'll be in the dojo." she growled.<p>"Okay." Ranma said.<p>Looking out at the quivering mass of flesh that was Ryoga Ranma shook her head and started to walk forward.<p>"I'll get Ryoga to the clinic." she said. "Save me some dinner, will ya Kasumi?" she called over her shoulder.<p>"Okay Ranma." Kasumi called after him.<p>Walking up to Ryoga Ranma sighed as he whimpered in pain.<p>"I hope you learned your lesson Ryoga." she said as she picked him up by the collar and began to drag him off. _ _ _<p>Two hours later Ranma returned home. As she walked up the street Ranma spotted Akane sitting on the roof of the dojo. Instead of heading into the house when she reached the gate Ranma instead hopped onto the roof.<p>Approaching Akane Ranma stopped a few feet short and crouched down.<p>"You okay Akane?" Ranma asked.<p>Sniffling Akane looked up at Ranma.<p>"Yeah, I'm fine Ranma. Just upset that's all." she said.<p>"Okay." Ranma said with a nod.<p>Sitting there for a few moments in silence Ranma thought. Reaching a conclusion cleared her throat.<p>"I would have told you, you know but Ryoga made me promise not to tell you." she said.<p>Akane chuckled. "I thought as much. As many hints as you've dropped what else could it have been?" she said.<p>"My old weakness." Ranma quipped dryly. Getting up she walked over to Akane. "Mind if I sit down?" she asked.<p>"Go right ahead." Akane said as Ranma sat down. "What I can't believe is how blind I was. How could I have not seen it?" she asked.<p>Ranma shrugged. "Eh, we see what we want to see 'till we open our eyes. Look at Tatewaki." she said.<p>"I guess." Akane said as she leaned against Ranma.<p>Putting her arm around Akanes waist Ranma leaned back. They didn't say anything more as they watched the sun set over the horizon. _ _ _<p>End.
