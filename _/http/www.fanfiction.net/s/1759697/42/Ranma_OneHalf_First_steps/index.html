</div><p>1RanmaOnehalf: First steps. Book Four.</p><p>Chapter 10.</p><p><i>Disclaimer: Bre Johnson and all diary entrys are copyright Jackie Bethke<br/></i></p><p><i>Ok...here  we go. The plane just took off out of Waterloo International Airport.  I'll catch the flight to Tokyo in . This all started about 3  weeks ago when my parents died. The next day was the reading of the  will. Me, 3 aunts, 5 uncles, and 2 close friends of the family, and a  liar...oops... I mean a lawyer. Well, I have known most all of my  life that I am adopted. Kinda obvious here. There last wish in the  will was for me to live with the biological family. So I'm off. 2  trunks full of clothes, jewelry boxes, nick knacks, and my toys. They  handed me a folder that was at least 4 inches thick of information on  the 3 of them. There is Naota Sano, aka the little brother, who ain't  so little. He is an OK student and not involved in many activities  but apparently is the one one I've been playing with on the Quake  servers. Kamone Sano, aka the father, a dumb schmuck as I understand.  He runs a print shop, a rather successful one as I understand.  Dokuohtei Sano, aka the grandfather, Owns/runs the print shop, and is  a master at Shogi, whatever that is. I know the area where we will be  living. Nerima is an odd little area, I think I can survive it.  Goodnight.</i></p><p>It was jam  -packed at the Sano apartment as the younger members of the Anything  Goes School and the Hagakure School sat down to figure out how to  integrate Kenji into the Sano household. Presiding over the meeting  was Grandpa and Kamone Sano. After setting out a drink tray and some  finger foods thoughtfully prepared by Matoko they set down to  business.</p><p>"So..."  Naota began "Any ideas?"</p><p>The group seated  around the table were silent as they thought over the problem. After  a few moments Kenji was the first to speak.</p><p>"Well, if  it helps I really don't have that much stuff." he began. "Just  my computer rig, my drafting table, my art, and my clothes."</p><p>"You gonna  be sharing a room?" Christian asked.</p><p>Naota shrugged.  "Looks like. Not that I mind." he said. "I'll have to  clean out a space in my room and go with bunk beds."</p><p>Lia and Mamimi  shivered at the mention of Naotas room.</p><p>"Well,  don't expect us to help with that. We ain't going near it." Lia  said as Mamimi nodded in agreement.</p><p>Naota snorted as  he looked at the two girls. "I heard the way you two screamed. I  wouldn't dare." he said. "though the hard part is going to  be rigging another computer setup in my room. I wish we were moving  into our own apartment."</p><p>Lia glanced at  Naota as he trailed off. "What is it?" she asked.</p><p>Naota blinked  and glanced at Lia. "We do have an apartment." he said. he  then glanced over at his grandfather before continuing. "Hey  Grandpa, are we using the apartment above the shop for anything  important?"</p><p>Grandpa Sano  blinked as he looked up from the shogi board. "Ah, no, not  really. All we have in there is stuff we haven't gotten around to  throwing away yet." he said. "I've been meaning to clean it  out."</p><p>"How about  we clean it out and Kenji and I move in?" Naota asked. "It's  just the right size for two teenagers."</p><p>"Plus my  father won't be anywhere near it." Kenji added.</p><p>Grandpa Sano  nodded and looked at Kamone. "Well Kamone? What do you think?"  he asked.</p><p>Kamone scratched  his chin for a moment as he thought about it. "Well, he does  need to learn how live on his own. And Kenji does have a good point."  he said thoughtfully. "And we do need someone at the shop to  look over it during the off hours. The alarm company we have is a  waste of money anyways."</p><p>"Good  point." Grandpa Sano said as he moved a piece. "A Hagukure  -trained cat demon makes for an excellent alarm system. And he's  better armed than the security guards the company uses."</p><p>Naota rolled his  eyes as he listened to his grandfather and father talk. "You  know guys, not everyone has to armed to the molars."</p><p>"Well, in  Nerima it's a necessity." Grandpa Sano retorted.</p><p>"Oh, be  quiet-"Naota began before stopping in mid sentence.</p><p>"What is  it?" Grandpa Sano asked.</p><p>"Theres  someone at the door." Naota answered.</p><p>A knock at the  door confirmed what Naota said as he got up.</p><p>"You  expecting someone?" his father asked as he walked to the door.</p><p>'No. And it's  not anyone I recognize either." Naota said as he looked out the  peephole. "It's some girl. Probably a wrong address."</p><p>Opening the door  Naota came face to face with the person on the other side. It was a  girl, in her late teens or early twenties with her hair braided and  put into several ponytails. She was wearing a bright blue tank top  and baggy black jeans with lots of chains hanging from them. Behind  her was an over sized bag seemingly packed to the max.</p><p><i>"She  looks a lot like dad...'</i>Naota thought before he spoke. "Can  I help you?"</p><p>The girl blinked  and looked at Naota fearfully for a second before she responded.</p><p>"I-i-i-is  this the Sano residence?" she asked in a heavy American accent.</p><p><i>"Okay,  now this is starting to get what I would call 'odd'."</i>Naota  thought. "Ah, yes it is. Why do you ask?"</p><p>"I-I'm  looking for a Kamone Sano." the girl said.</p><p>"Oh."Naota  said as he stepped aside. "Come on in then."</p><p>"Than you."  the girl said as she stepped inside.</p><p>"You're  welcome." Naota answered as he closed the door. "What's  your name by the way?"</p><p>"Bre. Bre  Johnson." the girl answered. "Whats yours?"</p><p>"Naota."  Naota answered.</p><p>Bre gave Naota  an odd look before heading to the living room. Naota noticed this and  filed it away for later as he followed her. As they entered everyone  looked up at the newcomer.</p><p>"Hey Dad,  someone wants to see you." Naota said as he and Bre sat down at  the table.</p><p>"Oh, hello.  And who might you be?" Kamone asked.</p><p>"Bre."  Bre answered. Reaching into one of the cavernous pockets of her jeans  she pulled an envelope out. "And this is for you."</p><p>Taking the  envelope from Bre Kamone opened it and began to read. As he did that  Naota began to read his fathers body language and analyzed what he  saw.</p><p>"So, you're  an American." Lia said as an opener.</p><p>Bres eyes went a  little wide at the sight of Lias cursed form. "Ah, yes I am."  she said as she nodded.</p><p><b>"Cool.  Now I have someone else to talk to."</b>Lia answered, dropping  her Japanese accent and in English.</p><p>Bres eyes went  wide at Lias response and she pointed at Lia. <b>"You- you're an  American!" </b>she said in English.</p><p>Lia nodded.  <b>"Yep. And proud of it." </b></p><p>Bre smiled  slightly and held out her hand. <b>"So am I." </b>she said.  <b>"Bre Johnson." </b></p><p>Lia returned the  smile as she shook Bres hand. <b>"Lia Saotome." </b>she  said. <b>"What brings you here?" </b></p><p>Bre shrugged and  jerked her thumb at Kamone. <b>"Ask him. He'll be able to tell  you, right 'Dad'?"</b></p><p>Lias eyes bugged  out and Naota glanced over at the two of them.</p><p>"Dad?' You  telling her about your father?" Naota asked, only getting half  of what was said.</p><p>Lia shook her  head and pointed at Kamone. "Naota, I think you ask your father  about your family history." she said.</p><p>"Family  history..." Naota asked, a puzzled tone in his voice. Scowling  he reached over and snatched the papers out of his fathers hand.  "Gimme those."</p><p>"Hey, I was  reading those-" Kamone began as Naota began to skim the top  document.</p><p>'Certificate of  adoption-" Naota mumbled as he read. Pausing he looked at Bre  for a second before turning his gaze back to his father. "You  care explaining why this says I have a long -lost sister, father?"  he asked, holding up the sheaf of papers.</p><p>Lia, Bre,  Christian and Mamimi scooted away from Naota as his gold -colored chi  flowed around him. Swallowing nervously Kamone looked at his son.</p><p>"Well, it's  a long story..." Kamone began.</p><p>"So start  talking.' Naota growled.</p><p>'You see, your  mother and I were in high school, and I got her pregnant."  Kamone began. Everyone in the room with the exception of Christian  and Mamimi rolled their eyes as Kamone continued. "And the clan  elders, well, the elders at that time were a bunch of conservative  throwbacks and they didn't approve."</p><p>"And so  they made you put her up for adoption.' Naota said, pointing at his  newly discovered sister.</p><p>"Actually  they wanted Haruko to have an abortion, but I said that of all the  sins he was going to commit, killing his children wasn't going to be  one of them." Grandpa Sano interjected.</p><p>"Anyways,  they agreed to allow us to put her up for adoption.' Kamone said. "I  made sure she would end up someplace far away from the Hagakure."</p><p>"I was  wondering about that..." Bre murmured to herself.</p><p>"And the  reason why you didn't tell me?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Because it  slipped my mind?" Kamone suggested.</p><p>Grandpa Sano  buried his face in his hand as Naotas chi began to build up and flow  around him. Items on shelves began to rattle and shake his right eye  began to twitch slightly.</p><p>"Bre, do  you have anything to say to our father at the moment?" Naota  asked, his voice dead calm.</p><p>Bre, her mind  completely off track by what was happening shook her head no.  "N-n-no." she stammered.</p><p>"Okay."  Naota answered.</p><p>Everyone in the  apartment jumped as Naota blurred and Kamone was slammed into the  wall face -first. Taking several deep breaths Naota calmed himself  down and looked at his grandfather.</p><p>"I'm going  to pack a bag and stay at the Saotomes until I have the apartment  cleaned out, okay?" Naota said.</p><p>Grandpa Sano  nodded and Naota tuned on his heel to go into his room. After he left  Bre looked at her newly discovered grandfather incredulously.</p><p>"You're  okay with that?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes. He  needs his own space right now." Grandpa Sano answered. glancing  at his son who was embedded face first into the plaster he continued.  "And besides, if he stayed here, odds are he'd kill Kamone for  being such a bloody idiot."</p><p>"Oh."  Bre said in a deadpan voice.</p><p>"Do you  have a hotel?" Grandpa Sano asked. "You can stay here if  you wish. Our couch is quite comfortable."</p><p>"Or you can  stay at our place." Lia offered. 'We won't mind."</p><p>Bre thought for  several seconds. Glancing at Kamone embedded in the wall she sighed.  "Thank you, but I'll stay with her until I can get a place."  she said. pointing to Kamone she continued. "After what he said  <i>I </i>want to kill him."</p><p>Grandpa Sano  smiled and nodded. "I understand.. Everyone usually does  eventually."</p><p>"Great!"  Lia said as she clapped her hands. "You can stay in the guest  room."</p><p>"Thank  you."Bre said.</p><p>"Hey,  where's Naota gonna sleep?" Christian asked.</p><p>'Your room."  Lia answered.</p><p>"Okay."  Christian said with a shrug.</p><p>"And if you  try anything..." Lia began.</p><p>"I'll make  you look like Pippy Long stockings." Naota finished as he  stepped out with a packed bag. "You coming Kenji?"</p><p>Kenji shook his  head. "No, I'll stay here thank you. Its a second home to me,  and I need to feel safe right now." he said.</p><p>"Okay."  Naota said with a nod. "Feel free to play as much Quake as you  wish. I don't want you going through withdrawal on me."</p><p>"Okay.  Thanks." Kenji answered.</p><p>"You're  welcome.' Naota answered. "Now lets go."</p><p>Walking  alongside Lia Bre kept glancing put the corner of her eye at Lia.</p><p>"Something  the matter?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Huh-no.  I'm fine, thanks for asking." Bre answered.</p><p>"Oh. You  kept looking at me so I was just wondering." Lia said.</p><p>"Oh, that."  Bre said. "I was wondering why you don't have markings like  him." she added, pointing to Naota.</p><p>"Oh, that."  Lia said with a wave of her hand. "He has those 'cause he's a  cat -demon and I just have a mixed curse."</p><p>"Mixed  curse? What are you talking about?" Bre asked as she gave Lia an  odd look.</p><p>'I got hit with  two curses at the same time." Lia explained. "From cursed  spring water. One was 'Spring of Drowned Girl', the other was 'Spring  of Drowned Cat.' I fell into a barrel of the water from the girl  spring, then when I was climbing out some water from the cat spring  fell in."</p><p>"Oh."  Bre said. "Why were you near those barrels?"</p><p>Lia sighed and  pointed to her little brother walking ahead of them. "I was  rescuing him." she said. "But he ended up getting cursed  himself. Watch."</p><p>Bre watched as  Christian walked along, and sure enough as they passed by a yard a  stream of water from a garden hose came arcing over the wall and  smacked Christian on the head. Instantly black hair turned bright red  and clothes became considerably baggier.</p><p>Bres jaw went  slack as she pointed at Christian.</p><p>"He- he-  he- he- turned-" she said, her brain not comprehending what had  just happened.</p><p>"Actually,  technically it's <i>she </i>now." Lia said.</p><p>"I'm a  boy!" Christian snapped back.</p><p>"But try to  refer to Christian as male. Its a sore for him." Lia added.</p><p>Bre nodded  absently as they continued walking. They walked in silence for a few  moments before Lia nudged Bre in the arm.</p><p>"So,"  she began. "How old are you?"</p><p>"Wha-oh.  Twenty -three." Bre answered.</p><p>"So what  made you come here?" Lia asked.</p><p>"My parents  died, and it was in their will that I finish my education with my  biological family." Bre answered.</p><p>"Oh,  sorry..." Lia said. "I didn't know."</p><p>"It's  okay." Bre said. "but once I'm done with that, I'm heading  back home to the states."</p><p>"Oh. Well,  at least you have a year to go." Lia said.</p><p>"Five. I'm  going for my masters in computer sciences." Bre answered.  "Though it's my turn for questions. How are you?"</p><p>"Seventeen."  Lia answered. "When I go to college I want to take teaching  courses."</p><p>"Anything  in particular? Or just general education?" Bre asked.</p><p>"English."  Lia answered. "I want some people around here to at least speak  it properly."</p><p>"And what  about you, Naota?" Bre asked. "What are your plans?"</p><p>Naota shrugged,  "Right now, just graduating high school is my immediate goal.  After that, well I was gonna take business management so I can help  with the print shop."</p><p>"Oh. And on  another subject, what was with all that 'clan elders' stuff? You part  of some ainchent ninja clan or something?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yes."  Naota answered. "Grandpa, Dad, myself, we're all ninjas of the  Hagakure clan."</p><p>'You're joking."  Bre said.</p><p>"Nope."  Naota answered. "We're all highly skilled killers."</p><p>"Well,  don't expect me to join you.' Bre said.</p><p>"Don't  worry.' Naota told her. "You're exempt. I told the clan I was  the last of the Sano family to trained in the Hagakure school."</p><p>"And they  accepted it?' Bre asked.</p><p>"Yep. I  told them if they refused it would be loud and messy, and they don't  like that." Naota answered.</p><p>"Okay..."  Bre said as they rounded the corner onto the street that the Saotomes  lived. "So do you do anything else?"</p><p>"Well, we have  our hobbies. Dad and Grandpas is drinking and shogi. Mines Quake and  my guitar." Naota said. "And that reminds me. If you have any  questions about the family ask Grandpa. He's the only one you can get  a straight answer out of."</p><p>"Oh, thanks.  I'll keep that in mind." Bre said.</p><p>"One more  thing: What kind of games do you play?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Quake, chess,  Texas Hold'em, a few RPGS." Bre answered. "Why?"</p><p>"If you talk  to Grandpa odds are you're gonna end up playing something." Naota  told her. "He plays western chess as well as shogi. Poker too."</p><p>'How good is  he?" Bre asked.</p><p>"He's a  grandmaster of both form of chess and if he ever retires, God help  Harrah's and the WSOP(1)." Naota answered.</p><p>"Sounds like a  challenge." Bre said.</p><p>"You're funeral." Naota said as the gate came into view.</p><p><i>Dear Diary,</i></p><p><i>This day has  been totally unbelievable. I met my "family" today. Talk  about totally wrong. The little brother-ish one claims to be a demon.  He has a cats ears and tail, and totally wicked tattoos. His girl  just had the ears and tail. And her girl sibling turns from a boy to  a girl depending on what type of water you splash it with. My  biological parental unit of the male type (aka birth dad) is human,  at least. Though he was almost killed by the demonic one. The  Grandfather-ish one is the one I had to ask for answers, all he wants  to do is play games, thought what shogi is I haven't the slightest.  OH and the fun news my family is a family full of ninjas. This is to  weird to be true. Yeah I have herd that things are strange in Nerima  but this is totally whacked. This cant be true. It's to out there to  be anywhere near the truth. It's just not true. Nope all lies. </i></p><p>Naotas eyes  flickered open as he came out of the light doze he had been in.  Looking around the darkened room he immediately began to sort through  his senses to find what had awoken him. Next to him he heard the soft  breathing of Christian and Mamimi combined with the soft staccato of  their heartbeats. There was the creaks of the house and the gentle  rustle of the wind outside, and when he focused Lias heartbeat coming  from th next room.</p><p>His ears  twitched when he heard the soft whine of a fan and the gentle patter  of fingers on a keyboard. Creasing his brow he rose and padded to the  door. Opening it he walked down the hall to the guest room and  knocked softly on the door.</p><p>Bre answered a  few moments later, dressed in her sleepwear of a spaghetti strap top  and sweats.</p><p>"What is it?"  she asked.</p><p>"Just  checking." Naota answered. "I heard your typing and thought I'd  check."</p><p>"Don't tell me  you're picking up some brotherly instincts already." Bre said in a  deadpan voice. "And how could you hear my typing?"</p><p>"Easy."  Naota answered. "Demonic hearing. I can hear your heartbeat at five  meters."</p><p>"Oh yeah, I  forgot about that." Bre said as she looked at Naota. Noticing his  bare torso she arched an eyebrow. "Just how far do those stripes  go?"</p><p>"All the way."  Naota answered. "And that's all I'm going to say."</p><p>"Okay." Bre  said. "I'll try to type softer."</p><p>'It's okay."  Naota answered. "I wasn't sleeping anyways. I was thinking about  Kenji."</p><p>"Oh. That tall  kid?" Bre asked.</p><p>'Thats him."  Naota answered with a nod.</p><p>"If you don't  mind me asking, what happened to him? He looked like he got hit by  truck." Bre asked.</p><p>"His father."  Naota answered. "I took care of him."</p><p>"Hopefully it  was slow and painful." Bre said.</p><p>Naota shook his  head. "Nope. A scumbag like him isn't worth going to hell for."  he said. "I just scared him."</p><p>"Good." Bre  said. "Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get on line. I saw He who  Ownz on a local sever and I want to go head to head with him."</p><p>"Good luck."  Naota said.</p><p>"Thanks."  Bre said as she shut the door to the guest room.</p><p>As he walked  back to Christians room Naota snickered to himself.</p><p>"<i>You're  looking for He who Owns? You don't know how close you came to finding  him." </i>he thought.</p><p>Bre Yawned as  she came downstairs to breakfast. Reaching the bottom of the stairs  she was surprised to find only Ranma at the table.</p><p>"Good  morning." he said. "Or I should say good afternoon."</p><p>"Whatever."  Bre said as she sat down. "Nnngh... caffeine."</p><p>"Right here."  Ranma said as he poured Bre some tea. "Have some tea."</p><p>"Thanks."  Bre said as she took the cup. "I take it everyones at school?"</p><p>"Yep.  Christian and Mamimi are at their school, Naota and Lia are at  Furinkan, and Akane is in the dojo with her morning class."</p><p>"Morning  class?" Bre asked.</p><p>"We teach  martial arts." Ranma explained. "Akane has the morning classes  and I have the afternoons."</p><p>"Okay." she  said. Rubbing her head she groaned 'Ooog... jet lag."</p><p>"So I take it  your not hungry then." Ranma said.</p><p>"No. Not at  the moment." answered Bre.</p><p>"Oh well. When  you do, let me know." Ranma said. "So, on another matter, how are  you liking our humble abode?"</p><p>"Its okay."  Bre said with a shrug. "Some of its a little different. Like the  curses."</p><p>"Those can  take a little getting used to." Ranma said as he scratched the back  of his head. "Though you are taking it well."</p><p>"Thanks."  Bre said. "But I have a question: Is Naota really a demon like he  claims?"</p><p>Ranma nodded.  "Yep. He's a demon." he answered. "And that reminds me, don't  go talking about it out in public. It draws attention from the wrong  type of people."</p><p>Bres caffeine  level was high enough that she actually managed to crack a smile.</p><p>"Oh? Don't  want the goverment to come sniffing around?" she asked.</p><p>Ranma snorted.  "Government hell. It's shrine maidens we gotta worry about."</p><p>"Say what?"  Bre deadpanned.</p><p>'It's true.  We've three in the past month come around." Ranma said.</p><p>"They cant be  <i>that</i> dangerous." Bre countered. "I mean, what can they  do?"</p><p>"Sealing  arrows for one thing." Ranma answered. "Their aim is terrible.  They always miss him and hit something else. We've been lucky they  haven't hit anyone."</p><p>"Oh, and  speaking of my new little brother, are he and Lia dating?" Bre  asked.</p><p>Ranma snorted.  "No. They're just friends. They've decided to wait till later  before going anywhere, contract or no."</p><p>"Contract?"  Bre asked. 'What contract?"</p><p>"They didn't  tell you?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"No." Bre  answered. "What are you talking about?"</p><p>"Theres a  marriage contract between our families." Ranma said.</p><p>Bre blinked in  surprise. "You're kidding."</p><p>"Believe me, I  wish I was." Ranma sighed. "My father and your grandfather  thought it up."</p><p>"Ranma, even  for this zoo thats strange." Bre shot back.</p><p>"I know."  Ranma answered. "Though be glad that it fell on Naota and Lia."</p><p>"Why?" Bre  asked.</p><p>"As the eldest  child it would have been and Christian." Ranma explained.</p><p>Bre blinked for  a second, then shuddered. "Eeeew! Thats gross!" she said. "Now  I'm definitely glad I was adopted."</p><p>"Thank  goodness or small favors, huh?" Ranma asked as he got up. "You  feel up to eating now?"</p><p>Bre thought for  a second and looked down at her stomach. "Strangely enough, yes."  she said.</p><p>"I'll go fix  you something." Ranma said as he headed to the kitchen.</p><p><i>Ok...killme  now. Lias parents are like her brother turning to the opposite sex!  And they can all, and I do mean ALL, even the little ones, can KILL  ME AT ANY TIME! It's totally wrong. They can do Matrix moves  without wires or anything. This is all totally wrong...and  scary...and terrifying very very very very wrong...oh god help  me...please. The Saotome household is warm, welcoming, clean,  and...interesting. Oh then there is Matoko, and her katana. Thats as  scary as Naota and Lia SPARRING. </i></p><p>Bre looked up  from her laptop when she heard the raucous arrival of the Saotome  children and their associates.</p><p>"I'm telling  you, it is!" Naota said as he and Lia stepped into the main room  followed by the others.</p><p>"Okay then,  lets find out. Meet me in the dojo." Lia answered.</p><p>"Ooh! Fight!"  Christian said excitedly.</p><p>"Am I missing  something? Or is this a lovers spat?" Bre asked from the table.</p><p>"They're just  comparing who's technique is better." Matoko answered. "So I  think they're going to go spar in the dojo."</p><p>"Ooo-kay."  Bre said. "This I gotta see." she said as she got up.</p><p>A few minutes  later Bre was sitting in the dojo with Matoko and the little ones as  Lia and Naota faced off against each other.</p><p>"Ready?"  Matoko asked.</p><p>Lia and Naota  nodded to each other and stepped into their ready stances as Matoko  raised her hand. Bringing it down she slapped her palm against the  floor with a loud slap.</p><p>"Go!" she  said.</p><p>Naota  immediately lashed out with kick and Bres jaw dropped as Lia skated  backwards to dodge.</p><p>"How-?" Bre  asked.</p><p>"They're just  getting warmed up. Watch." Christian said as he pointed.</p><p>Naota rushed  forwards to press his attack, his arms blurring into a bundle of  snakes as he unleashed a massive outburst of punches and Lia  responding with a burst Chestnut Fist punches. They skated around  each other trading punches until Lia broke to the outside and  transitioned into a mid level round house kick.</p><p>Naota ducked and  rolled backwards as Lia continued in a spin and then brought her  right heel down in an ax kick. Rolling backwards onto his feet and  then shot upwards a meter into the air.</p><p>He paused for a  heartbeat before shooting forwards and lashing out with a series of  kicks. Lia shielded herself with her forearms as she ducked and Naota  passed over her. Overshooting Lia Naota hit the wall feet first and  spun in place so he was facing the direction he came.</p><p>Exploding  forwards he again came at Lia with another series of kicks. She threw  up her arms again to block but Naota, instead of going for a high  level attack caught Lia by surprise by shooting down and  transitioning into a sweeper kick.</p><p>Lia was swept  off her feet as Naotas sweeper kick connected. Falling sideways Lia  landed on her hands and began to gather herself into a handspring,  but Naota instead did another sweeper kick and knocked Lias hands out  from under her.</p><p>Naotas snapped  out with his left hand and grabbed the front of Lias shirt. Yanking  her down Naota brought her down to the floor snapping his right hand  in a punch, stopping a bare centimeter from her throat. They were  still for a few moments before letting go of Lias shirt and  withdrawing his hand.</p><p>Standing up he  held out his hand and helped Lia to her feet.</p><p>"Well?"  Naota asked as Lia straightened out her shirt.</p><p>"Okay, yours  is better." Lia said. "But it still has limits."</p><p>Naota nodded as  he stretched his arm. "That I concede." he said. "Your sk8ter  technique has its strong points. Dodging for example."</p><p>"True.' Lia  said with a nod. Narrowing her eyes a smile crept across her lips as  an idea came to her. "I wonder what would happen if I combined  them..."</p><p>Shaking his head  Naota turned around to Bre.</p><p>"So, what do  you think?" he asked.</p><p>"Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah..."  was all Bre could say, her mouth agape. "How...how... how did  you... how did you do that?"</p><p>"Chi." Lia  answered.</p><p>"Chi?" Bre  asked. "That was <i>chi?</i>"</p><p>'Yep."  Christian answered. "Me an' Mamimi can do the same thing too."</p><p>Bres eyes went  to the size of dinner plates as she looked at Christian and Mamimi.  Looking over at Matoko she pointed at them.</p><p>"They-they-they..."  she stammered.</p><p>Matoko nodded as  she reached into her gym bag and pulled out her katana.</p><p>"Yes, thats  true." she said. "Now if anyone doesn't mind I'm going to  practice my kendo."</p><p>"Urk!" was Bres response as her eyes rolled back in her head and  she fainted.</p><p>"You gonna be  okay?" Naota asked.</p><p>"I'm fine, it  just... its a bit much, okay?" Bre answered.</p><p>"I'm just  checking." Naota answered. "I feel the same way too."</p><p>"So who are we  meeting again?" Bre asked as they turned a corner.</p><p>"The rest of  my friends." Naota answered. "I talked to em and they volunteered  their services. With them helping we can have the apartment livable  in two days."</p><p>"Oh. Anything  I should know about them beforehand?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Just that  Hideo is a perv." Naota answered. "But he's easy to deal with."</p><p>"Yeah, just  bludgeon him with blunt objects." Lia interjected.</p><p>"Thanks. I'll  keep that in mind." Bre said. Glancing back she looked at Christian  and Mamimi. "So what are we taking the little ones?"</p><p>"To keep them  out of trouble." Naota answered.</p><p>"Of course  with Christian thats a lost cause." Lia added.</p><p>"Am not!"  Christian shot back at her sister.</p><p>"Are too,  Chris -<i>chan.</i>" Lia answered.</p><p>Christian opened  her mouth to answer but couldn't think of anything to say.</p><p>"So shes a  trouble maker?" Bre asked as she pointed at Christian.</p><p>'Hey!"  Christian shouted. "I'm a boy!"</p><p>"Sorry, <i>he's  </i>a trouble maker?" Bre corrected herself.</p><p>"Nah." Lia  answered with a shake of her head. "It's more like it finds him."</p><p>"Oh." Bre  answered.</p><p>As they neared  the mouth of an alley Naota held up his hand directed them to it. He  led them into the alley and around trash bins until they reached a  tiny courtyard. Standing in the courtyard were five boys who's  appearance screamed 'unpopular'.</p><p>The tallest of  the group looked up when Naota and Lia entered.</p><p>"Yo, Naota!  What took you?" he asked.</p><p>"Hey Hideo."  Naota answered. "We had to revive Bre after she fainted."</p><p>'Fainted? What  happened?" Hideo asked.</p><p>"I saw Trinity  and Neo here sparring." Bre answered.</p><p>"That will do  it." Hideo answered. Walking over to Bre he extended his hand. "And  you must be the long -lost sister we were told about."</p><p>"That I am."  Bre answered as she shook his hand.</p><p>"Though I am  surprised that you'd be an American-  AAAAAHHHHHHIIIiiiiiieeeeeee..." Hideo said be he toppled over  onto the ground and curled up into a fetal ball.</p><p>"And watch  where you look." Bre said.</p><p>"Ah, I see you  were warned about Hideo." One of the other boys said as he walked  over.</p><p>"Yeah. I gave  her a heads up on the way over here." Naota said. Looking up he  patted the boy on the shoulder. "Bre, this is Eichiro.  Eichiro, this is my sister Bre."</p><p>"Hello."  Eichiro said.</p><p>"And over  there are Haruhiro and Bunjiro." the two boys nodded as Naota  pointed them out. "And the one sitting in the delivery truck is  Fujimaro."</p><p>"Hey."  Fujimaro answered with a wave.</p><p>"And you've  met Hideo." Naota added as he pointed downwards to the ground.</p><p>"Will...to  ...live... fading..." Hideo wheezed.</p><p>"Now lets get cracking. The sooner we get the apartment cleaned out  the sooner I don't have to bunk with Christian and Kenji here dosen't  have to crash at my place." Naota said as he fished the keys to the  apartment out of his pocket.</p><p>They were two  hours into the emptying out of the apartment when Bre stumbled across  what looked like a pile of junk covered with a tarp.</p><p>"Hey Naota,  come give me hand with this tarp." Bre called.</p><p>"Coming..."  Naota said from the area near the kitchen.</p><p>Walking over to  Bre he went to the opposite side of the tarp and picked it up. With  Bre at the other end they lifted the tarp off and their jaws dropped  at what was under it.</p><p>That turned out  to be a '96 Suzuki GSX -R600 and a Vespa scooter.</p><p>"I don't  believe it." Naota said, his voice full of disbelief.</p><p>'What?" Bre  asked.</p><p>"He <i>kept  </i>them." answered Naota. "Dads bike and Moms scooter."</p><p>"Our mother  rode <i>that?</i>" Bre asked, pointing to the Vespa.</p><p>"Yeah."  Naota answered with a nod of his head. "Dad said that when he rode  it, it was a religious experience."</p><p>"Religious  experience?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yeah."  Naota said with a nod. "He said something about a little red  button."</p><p>"She put  nitrous(2) on it?" Bre asked.</p><p>"I guess."  Naota said with a shrug. "But we can check fr that later. Right now  we have to get them downstairs."</p><p>"Right. I'll  get a couple of the guys-" Bre began.</p><p>"I got it."  Naota said as he stepped up to the Vespa. "I have a demons strength  remember."</p><p>Bre gulped as  Naota casually picked up the Vespa and walked to the door, carrying  the scooter like it was nothing. Carefully he threaded the scooter  out the door and onto the landing. Lifting it up he began to carry it  down the stairs.</p><p>Stepping out of  the bedroom with a box of junk Lia saw Bre standing staring at the  door open mouthed.</p><p>"You okay?"  Lia asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Bre  said with a nod. "I just got reminded that my brother is a demon."</p><p>"Oh. What did  he do?" Lia asked.</p><p>"He picked up  a scooter like it was a cardboard box and hauled it down the stairs."  Bre answered.</p><p>"Oh, yeah. He  can do that." Lia said before heading to the door.</p><p>Bre gaped as Lia walked out the door.</p><p>"Well, that  was the last of it." Naota said as he stepped back into the  apartment. "That was the last box."</p><p>"I still say  you should have left the bikes up here." Hideo said. "They made  great decoration."</p><p>"Hideo, unlike  you, some people like to have their machinery <i>outside." </i>Naota  sighed. "Besides, we have to replace the carpet and they would have  been in the way."</p><p>"We doing that  tomorrow?" Eichiro asked.</p><p>"I was  thinking we could rip it up tomorrow, them we could paint." Naota  answered. "You can get the paint we need, right?" he asked  Fujimaro.</p><p>'Yeah."  Fujimaro answered with a nod. "Kenji gave me a color list, and my  dad has all of the colors in stock."</p><p>"Good.  Everybody meet up here after school tomorrow?" Naota asked. Getting  a round of affirmatives he nodded. "Okay. See you then."</p><p>"Okay, now  lets go home." Bre said. "I don't know about you guys but I want  to go get cleaned up."</p><p>"Ditto." Lia  added. "I've gotta wash all this crud out of my hair."</p><p>"In that case  you had better use the furo first." Matoko told Bre. "It takes  forever to wash Lias hair."</p><p>"Uh, <i>yeah</i>."  Bre said as she looked at Lias pigtail, which hung to past her knees.</p><p>Thus they began  to walk home to the Saotome household, Christian and Mamimi ranging  forwards of the group but staying in sight. Walking alongside Kenji  Bre cast a glance up at him.</p><p>"Can I ask you  a question?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yes." Kenji  answered.</p><p>"What were you  and Mamimi doing wandering around the apartment?"</p><p>Kenji shrugged  lopsidedly as he walked. "I was laying out the decor of the  apartment and she was taking notes. It was the only thing I can do  right now." he said. "That and playing Quake."</p><p>"So my brother  mentioned." Bre said. "By the way, how good are you?"</p><p>"I'm good."  answered Kenji.</p><p>His answer  piqued Bres interest. "How good?" she asked. "He who Ownz  good?"</p><p>"I like to  think so." Kenji answered. "Though you're a close second."</p><p>"Thanks Kenji-  waitaminute." Bre said as Kenjis answer registered on her brain.  "The only way you'd know that is if you're-"</p><p>Kenji nodded as  they walked along. Bre worked her mouth up and down a few times as  she tried to figure out what to say.</p><p>"You?" she  finally asked.</p><p>"Uh huh."  Kenji answered.</p><p>"Huh." Bre  said. "I would have never figured it'd be <i>you.</i>"</p><p>"I get that a  lot." Kenji answered.</p><p>"And Naota  also tells me you're an artist." Bre added.</p><p>"Yeah."  Kenji said. "People say I'm pretty good."</p><p>Bre arced an  eyebrow as she looked at Kenji. "Like you're good at Quake?"</p><p>"Well..."  Kenji began "Actually, not to brag, but I'm <i>better.</i>"</p><p>"Oy." Bre  said. "I want to see your work."</p><p>"How about  tomorrow?" Kenji asked as they reached a cross street.</p><p>"Sounds good."  Bre answered as Kenji and Naota turned left.</p><p>"You guys go  on ahead. I gotta pick up some things at my place." Naota said as  they walked away.</p><p>"Don't be too  late. Matokos cooking tonight." Lia said as they started walking.</p><p>"Don't worry. I wont." Naota answered before they were out of  sight.</p><p>Naotas skin  prickled into goosebumps as an evening breeze blew down the street.</p><p>"Autumn's  coming." Naota commented.</p><p>"Yeah."  Kenji answered.</p><p>'Hows the arm?"  Naota asked, glancing at Kenjis cast.</p><p>"Hurts a bit.  Itches a lot too." Kenji answered. "Though I hope Lias uncle was  right and that it can come off soon. If I don't draw soon I'm gonna  go crazy."</p><p>"Quakes not  helping?" Naota asked.</p><p>"A little."  Kenji admitted. "But not enough. I gotta draw. At least Matoko can  still write."</p><p>Naota chuckled  at his friends predicament. "At least your thinking okay." he  said.</p><p>"How about  you?" Kenji asked. "How is you having a sister sitting with you?"</p><p>Naota sighed and  thought for several long moments.</p><p>"It's...it's...it's  still sinking in." he answered. "Finding out I have a sister is  cool and all, and Bres a great person, but..."</p><p>"But?"</p><p>"But I got a  reminder just how much I don't have." Naota answered. "I thought  about my- scratch that, <i>our </i>mother for the first time in a  while."</p><p>"At least you  have a father worthy of the name." Kenji said, hefting his cast. "I  wonder if my brother and I are the only ones in our family worth a  damn."</p><p>"Hey, he did  try to keep your parents focused on him." Naota pointed out. "I'd  say that answers your question."</p><p>"True."  Kenji agreed. "And he helped us with the Empty Year." he added,  looking at his left wrist.</p><p>"Yeah."  Naota agreed. "Speaking of your brother, have you talked to him?"</p><p>"Yeah. I  emailed him yesterday." Kenji said with a nod. "And I talked to  him on the phone."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"And as soon  as he can chisel out a date he'll come over." Kenji answered. "His  boss is running him ragged."</p><p>"Poor guy."  Naota said. "How did he react?"</p><p>"He's pissed  and he wants to kill our father." Kenji answered. "I walked him  out of seeing the folks for a while."</p><p>"Good idea."  Naota said.</p><p>"I told him  you have dibs on father." Kenji said as they rounded the corner.</p><p>"Thanks."  Naota said.</p><p>"Hey, you did  scare him, so I figure its the least I could do." Kenji said as  they approached their apartment building.</p><p>"You watch my  back and I watch your back." Naota answered with a shrug.</p><p>Kenji nodded in  agreement as they entered the apartment complex.</p><p>(1)World Series  of Poker. Just as the name says, it's <i>the </i>top poker  tournament.
