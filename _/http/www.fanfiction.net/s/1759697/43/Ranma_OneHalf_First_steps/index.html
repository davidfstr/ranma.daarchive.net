</div><p>1Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Four.</p><p>Chapter 11.</p><p>"So what exactly are we going to be doing again?"</p><p>"Helping Naota move into the apartment with Kenji." Lia answered.</p><p>"So why am I carrying a ridiculously oversize hammer and why is Matoko carrying her sword?" Bre asked, looking at the mallet in her hands.</p><p>"Well, first of all, thats a mallet, and second, the reason why we are armed is because we are going to be in Naotas room." Lia answered.</p><p>"Whats so important about my brothers room that we have to be armed?" Bre asked.</p><p>"You the swamp on Dagobah?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Yes." Bre said with a nod.</p><p>"His room is like that, only messier." Lia told her.</p><p>"And I think it smells worse." Mamimi added.</p><p>"Okay, now I get the idea." Bre said as she gripped the mallet handle tighter.</p><p>Rounding the corner the apartment building that the Sanos lived in came into view.</p><p>"And here we are." Lia said.</p><p>A few minutes later Lia was ringing the Sanos doorbell. The door opened to reveal Grandpa Sano.</p><p>"Hello." he said. "I assume you ladies are here to help Naota, or has Kamone done something stupid again?"</p><p>"We're here to help Naota." Lia answered as Grandpa Sano stepped aside. "Though speaking of his father, is he around?'</p><p>"No." Grandpa Sano said as he shut the door behind them. "I sent him on some errands for the day. The last thing I want is Naota committing murder."</p><p>'It's not like he wouldn't have a valid defense." Bre said as they entered the living room.</p><p>"Don't tempt me." Naota called from his room.</p><p>"Erk!"</p><p>Lia stifled a giggle at Bres expression. "Forgot that he could do that, couldn't you?" she said.</p><p>"Damn demon hearing..." she muttered, shooting a scowl in the direction of Naotas room. "I Still have those pictures Naota."</p><p>"Oh no you don't." Naota shot back. "I got the memory card from your camera."</p><p>"Pictures?" Grandpa Sano asked.</p><p>"This morning Christian and Mamimi were using Naota as a pillow." Bre answered. "And don't worry, my camera has wi -fi. Every things on my laptop."</p><p>"Aw <i>crap!</i>"</p><p>"Don't worry, it's secure." Bre answered. "And Lia told me who they would it be safe to show to."</p><p>"Oh, so she told you about the people smart enough to know what would happen to them if they blabbed, right?" Grandpa Sano asked.</p><p>"Uh, yeah." Bre said. "Though Lia never told me what that would be."</p><p>"Oh that's easy Bre." Naota said as he stuck his head into the living room. "I show them all the ways there are to inflict pain on someone."</p><p>"Uh...huh." Bre said, not quite knowing how to respond to her brothers answer.</p><p>'And could you give a hand in here? Theres a lotta crap in here that needs taken care of." Naota added.</p><p>"Coming."Lia and Bre answered.</p><p>"How the <i>hell </i>did you live in here?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Huh?" Naota asked, looking up from the drawer he was sorting through.</p><p>'I said, how did live in here?" Bre repeated. "It's a pigsty."</p><p>"It's not so bad." Naota answered.</p><p>"Bro, listen. My grandpa has a farm." Bre said, patting Naota on the shoulder. "I know what they look like."</p><p>"If you say so." Naota answered. "Hey, whats this- Yaaah!"</p><p>"What?" Bre asked, leaning around her brother to get a look.</p><p>'Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah..." was Naotas answer as he pointed to the interior of the drawer.</p><p>"I see." Bre said as she looked in the drawer. Taking the item she walked to the bedroom door and poked her head out into the living room. "Hey Lia, could you come in here for a second?"</p><p>"Sure." Lia answered as she stood up. "Whats up?"</p><p>Bre waited until she had shut the door behind Lia before answering. "Uh, Lia, did you forget something?" Bre asked, holding up the item in question.</p><p>Lia went beet red as she saw the pair of panties that Bre was holding. Snatching them away she stuffed them in her pocket and Bre watched as the insides of Lias ears went red.</p><p>"<i>Okay, I didn't know that her ears could blush like that." </i>Bre thought. "So, either of you care to take back anything you might have said about 'being friends'?"</p><p>"It's not what you think..." Naota began.</p><p>Bre arced an eyebrow as she looked at her brother. "Uh-huh. Riiight."</p><p>"Ah, let me explain." Naota said. "It was raining, and I had gone out to talk with the clan elders..."</p><p>"Without telling me." Lia added, having recovered from her embarrassment.</p><p>"And Lia found out about it and came charging over here after me." Naota continued. "And since she was soaked through Dad gave her a pair of my sweats to wear while her clothes were in the dryer..."</p><p>"And slipped a mickey into my tea." Lia added.</p><p>"That too, and by the time I got back I was exhausted that I didn't realize she was here until I sat down on my bed." Naota said. 'But I was so tired that I just moved her over and went to sleep."</p><p>"So nothing happened?" Bre asked. Getting nods from the both of them she sighed and shook her head. "You know, if it was anyone else but you two..."</p><p>Naota hung his head and looked at the floor. "I know." he mumbled.</p><p>Bre blinked as something occurred to her. "Hey Lia, were you wearing a bra when you came over here that day?' she asked.</p><p>Bre watched with amusement as Lia went red again and Naotas stripes went from gold to orange as he blushed.</p><p>"Don't worry. I'm sure it'll turn up." Bre said as she opened the door. "Take over for me Lia. I left my cell at the house."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said as Bre left.</p><p>Lia and Naota stood in an awkward silence for a few moments before Naota spoke up.</p><p>"Well, lets get started." he said.</p><p>"Lets." Lia said as she looked around the room. "Where do you want me to start?"</p><p>"Well, you can start with those magazines on the bed." Naota said as he pointed. "Just be careful."</p><p>"Why?" Lia asked, eying the box warily.</p><p>"I think Hideo stashed some stuff in there." explained Naota. "It could be hentai, it could be tech mags."</p><p>"Okay..." Lia said as she approached the box.</p><p>Bre hummed to herself as she stepped through the Saotomes gate into the yard. Noting the sign by the door which read 'Dojo of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts. To face the master i savage combat please go around back.' and underneath it there was also 'Morning and afternoon classes available. Inquire around back.'</p><p>Smiling at the sign Bre went around to the side of the house where the main room was and sat down on the porch to remove her shoes. Getting up she slid the screen open and was surprised to find Akane sitting at the table with a paper and a cup of tea.</p><p>"Oh, hello Bre." Akane said as she looked up. "Done already?"</p><p>"Nah, I just forgot my cell." Bre said as she stepped in. "Wheres Ranma?"</p><p>"Oh, he's out back with a student." Akane answered.</p><p>"Okay." Bre said as she headed to the stairs.</p><p>She padded up the stairs to the guest room and slid open the door. Stepping inside she walked over to the dresser where her cell was sitting in its charger. Picking it up she verified that it was fully charged and was about to go when she heard the sounds of sparring coming from the outside.</p><p>Walking to the window Bre looked out onto the outside practice area and her heart skipped a beat as she saw <i>him. </i></p><p><i>He </i>was six feet tall, with a lean well -muscled frame the rippled as he moved. Bre watched with interest as his skin glistened with sweat as he and Ranma sparred. Finally remembering to breathe Bre turned and rushed downstairs to where Akane was.</p><p>"Hey Akane, who's that guy Ranma is sparring with?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Huh?" Akane asked as she looked up. "Oh, thats Evans. He's a long -time student of ours. He's stationed at Camp Zama(1)."</p><p>"Is he single?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yeah, he's single. You wanna meet him?"was all Akane got out before Bre disappeared."I guess so." she said as she went back to her paper.</p><p>"OOOF!" said Evans as he landed with a thump.</p><p>He lay there for a few moments as his vision cleared. Shaking his head he took the hand Ranma offered and pulled himself up.</p><p>"Take a break?" Ranma offered.</p><p>"Yeah." Evans said with a nod. "Just let me get a towel and-"</p><p>"Here, take one."</p><p>"Uh, thanks." Evans said as he took the towel from Bre. "And hello."</p><p>"Hello." Bre said with a smile.</p><p>"Evans, meet Bre. Shes that girl I was telling you about who's staying with us." Ranma said.</p><p>"Oh." Evans said. <b>"You're an American." </b>he added, switching to English.</p><p>"<b>Yeah. Fresh in from Iowa." </b>Bre answered. <b>"How about you?" </b></p><p>"<b>Upstate New York. Mohawk reservation." </b>Evans answered. <b>"Though Nerima is becoming my second home though." </b></p><p>"<b>And we're his surrogate family." </b>added Ranma.</p><p>"<b>How long have you been here?" </b>Bre asked.</p><p>Evans shrugged. <b>"About nine years." </b>he said. <b>"Long enough to see Lia go from waist high to shoulder high and Matoko to my height."</b></p><p>"<b>How old are you, by the way?" </b>asked Bre.</p><p>"<b>Twenty -seven. You?" </b>Evans said.</p><p>"<b>Twenty -three." </b>Bre answered.</p><p>"<b>Oh." </b>Bre said with a nod.</p><p>Ranma smirked and flung his towel over his shoulder as he walked to the house. <b>'I'll be inside." </b>he said.</p><p>"<b>Okay." </b>Bre said with a wave of her hand.</p><p>"Ah, young love." Ranma said as he rounded the corner to come face to face with Akane.</p><p>"What?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Oh, Bre and Evans." Ranma said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder.</p><p>"Oh." Akane said as she stepped in close to Ranma and sniffed the air. "Mmmm...<i>man.</i>" she said.</p><p>"Evans do sent have a clue about thats going to hit him." Ranma said.</p><p>'I'll say. Bre was practically <i>drooling </i>when she came down." Akane said as she idly traced a finger over one of Ranmas biceps. "You know, we have an hour between Evans our afternoon classes..."</p><p>"I know." Ranma said with a smile. "Furo?"</p><p>"Mmm-hm." Akane said with a nod as the ringing of Bres cell came from around the corner.</p><p>Bre looked down at her pocket and frowned in annoyance. Sighing she withdrew her phone and looked at the display, which read 'Kitten calling'.</p><p>"Hold on, it's my brother. Lets see what he wants." Bre said as she flipped it open. "What do you want?"</p><p>Evans watched as Bre listened to Naotas reply.</p><p>'What do you mean I have to get over to the apartment right now? I'm busy." she said. She scowled slightly at Naotas response. "Whats so important that I have to get over there right away?"</p><p>Bres eyes went to the size of dinner plates as she listened to Naotas reply.</p><p>"The whole tube? In her <i>hair?</i>" Bre asked. She nodded as she listened to Naotas reply. "Alright, I'll be right over."</p><p>Disconnecting the call Bre flipped her phone closed and she looked at Evans.</p><p>'Sorry, I gotta go. Kenji was setting up his art area and stepped on a tube of paint." she said. "It went all over her face and hair and I gotta go help clean her up."</p><p>Evans smiled slightly and nodded. "Have fun." he said. "Though I'm on leave for the next couple of days, so if you want to talk..."</p><p>"Okay." Bre said as she flipped her phone open. "Whats your number?" she asked.</p><p>"0185-32-6518" Evans said. "I have an apartment in the next ward."</p><p>"You live off base?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yeah. It's easier that way." Evans said. 'Talk to you later."</p><p>"Later." Bre said as she turned away.</p><p>Turning the corner Bre ran into Ranma and Akane as they talked.</p><p>"Going some where?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Yeah. Lia had a bad encounter with a tube of Kenjis paints and I gotta go help with the clean up."</p><p>answered Bre.</p><p>"Do I even want to know the details?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"No, but lets just say her shirt and pants are a write off." Bre said.</p><p>"Okay." Ranma said. "Thanks for the heads up."</p><p>"You're welcome." Bre said. "Now if you'll excuse me I've got to get Lia some fresh clothes and I'll be on my way."</p><p>"Have fun." Ranma said to Bres retreating back.</p><p>Bre stepped into the apartment to find Kenji sitting in what could loosely be called his studio looking befuddled and Christian lying on the floor looking entirely too pleased with herself.</p><p>"Hey." Christian said with a wave.</p><p>"Hey." Bre answered. "Lias in the bathroom, right?"</p><p>"Yep." Christian answered.</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>Knocking on the door Bre gave everyone inside a heads up before she entered. Stepping inside she found Lia, Matoko, and Mamimi sitting by the tub. Lia was wearing only a towel, had her hair undone and soaking in the tub of hot water while her sister and Mamimi scrubbed the paint out.</p><p>"I got those clothes for you." Bre said as she set the bundle in a basket.</p><p>"Thanks." Lia said. "By the way, what was Christian doing?"</p><p>"Lying on the floor looking like the cat that ate the canary." Bre replied as she looked Lia over. "Oh man, you really got hit didn't you?"</p><p>"Thats putting it mildly." Lia answered. "And I was right."</p><p>"Huh?" Bre asked.</p><p>"I had a hunch my brother was behind this. This has his prints all over it." Lia said.</p><p>"So what are you gonna do?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Help get this crud out of my hair and I'll tell you." Lia said.</p><p>'Okay." Bre said as she walked over to the tub.</p><p>Mamimi scooted over to make room for Bre, who immediately started to work on the top of Lias head.</p><p>"So what do you have in mind? And why do you still have cats -eyes?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Thats cause of the Neko -ken Improved." Lia said. "I'll explain it later. Anyways, I was thinking when we get home Chris -<i>chan </i>in there is going to get the full beauty treatment."</p><p>"Full beauty treatment?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Uh -huh. The works. Shampoo, body wash, hair done up, the works." Lia said. "And she gets put into one of Grandma Nodokas dresses."</p><p>"Okay." Bre said as she worked her fingers into the mass of hair.</p><p>"Oooh, that feels good." Lia said with a purr. "But to do his I'll need all you girls help."</p><p>"You need my help?" Mamimi asked.</p><p>"Uh -huh. And you can get the full beauty treatment too if you want." Lia answered.</p><p>"Can I wear a dress too?" Mamimi asked.</p><p>"Sure." Lia answered. "Hey Bre, could move a little lower-aahhhhhh..."</p><p>Bre looked at the happily purring redhead and then up to Matoko. "Is this normal?" she asked.</p><p>Matoko nodded as she used a comb brush the clumps of paint out of Lias hair.</p><p>'Yes." she said "Lias always been this way."</p><p>"Chris -chan purrs too when I scrub his hair." Mamimi said from her position by the tub.</p><p>"You scrub his hair?" Bre asked. "Why?"</p><p>"Because he do sent do it right." Mamimi answered.</p><p>"Okay. Thats...<i>interesting</i>..." Bre said as she scrubbed Lias hair.</p><p>"Thats those two.' Lia corrected.</p><p>"Ah." Bre said with a nod.</p><p>Ranma stretched as he came in from the dojo, the last class of the day done. Humming to himself he headed down the hall, his mind on dinner.</p><p>"Hmm, now what would be good for dinner?" he asked him self. "Bres still not used to Japanese cuisine, so something middle of the road would be in order. Or I could just make hamburgers..."</p><p>So engrossed was Ranma that when he entered the main room he was caught totally by surprise for the sight that greeted him.</p><p><i>That </i>was Christian in girl form(2), clad in one of the dresses Nodoka had bought with her hair done up. Next to her was Mamimi, similarly clad.</p><p>"What happened?" asked Ranma.</p><p>"Chris -<i>chan </i>here rigged a tube of paint to fall where it would get stepped on and spray all over me." Lia said from her position in the corner.</p><p>"You did that?" Ranma asked, looking at Christian.</p><p>Christian sighed and looked down at her lap. "Yes..." she said.</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"I used the Umi -Sen -Ken." Christian answered.</p><p>"Okay..." Ranma said. "Though when I said for you to practice your chi techniques, I didn't mean to use them to play pranks on your sister."</p><p>"I know." Christian said. "Besides, I was aiming for Lias boyfriend."</p><p>"Naota is not my boyfriend Christian." Lia said in an exasperated tone. "And if you don't drop it you're going to school in a dress."</p><p>Ranma chuckled as Christian made a strangled choking noise. Shaking his head he headed for the kitchen.</p><p>"Good one Lia." Ranma said. "Now if you'll excuse me I have hamburgers to make."</p><p>"And so to get <i>a </i>divide <i>c </i>by <i>d </i>and then- huh?" Lia murmured to herself as her eyes crossed. "Arrg... I <i>hate </i>math." she groaned while rubbing her eyes.</p><p>Feeling stiff Lia decided to take a break. Rolling backwards away from her desk Lia went to the center of the room. Stopping in a kneeling position Lia bent backwards until her palms were flat on the floor.</p><p>A sudden knock at the door brought her back to the present.</p><p>"Come in." Lia said as the the door opened, revealing Bre on the other side.</p><p>"Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were busy..." she said as she started to back away.</p><p>'It's okay." Lia said. "I'm just taking a break from cramming for finals."</p><p>"Okay." Bre said as she stepped in. "I was going to ask you about Evans."</p><p>"What about him?" Lia asked as she put one foot on the floor.</p><p>"Well...what does he like?" Bre asked.</p><p>"What do you mean 'what does he like'? Anything specific?" Lia asked, putting the other foot flat on the floor.</p><p>"Ah, food, entertainment, stuff like that." Bre said as she sat down on the floor.</p><p>"Well.." Lia said as she tensed her self, then pushed herself into a handstand. "He likes brats and beer, Mickeys specifically. For entertainment he likes to just wander around Tokyo looking at the sights."</p><p>"Okay..." Bre said with a thoughtful look on her face.</p><p>'Bre, why are you asking me?" Lia asked, a puzzled look on her face. "Why not just ask him?"</p><p>Bre smiled and looked at Lia. "Lia, can you keep a secret?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said with a nod.</p><p>Leaning forwards Bre switched to English and spoke in a low tone. <b>"The reason why is I think hes cute, and I wanna surprise him." </b></p><p>"<b>You want to date him, in other words." </b>responded Lia, switching to English as well.</p><p>"<b>Yep." </b>Bre responded. <b>"And if you want to, I can give you some tips on what to do with my brother."</b></p><p>"<b>Huh?" </b>Lia asked. <b>"What are you walking about?" </b></p><p>Bre smirked at Lia as she leaned in close. <b>"You and Naota may be 'just friends' when your parents are around, but I've seen how you two act when no ones looking." </b>she said.</p><p>"<b>You have?" </b>Lia asked. <b>"What did you see?" </b></p><p>Bre shrugged. <b>"Oh, not much. Just you kissing him goodbye and the way he looked at you." </b>she said. <b>"That, and the way you two are always enjoying each others scents." </b></p><p>"<b>Erk!" </b>Lias eyes bugged out and her shirt fell down around her head. <b>"Crud." </b></p><p>"<b>How did you do that?" </b>Bre asked.</p><p>"<b>Chi." </b>Lia answered, her voice muffled by her shirt.</p><p>"<b>Oh, okay." </b>Bre said. <b>"So do you want some tips?" </b></p><p>"<b>Yeah." </b>Lia said as she shifted to one hand and pulled her shirt up.</p><p>Bre blinked as she saw Lia do a one -handed handstand while pulling her shirt up, but shook her head and continued.</p><p>"<b>Well, for starters to get his attention you'll want to wear something besides a baggy Chinese shirt and kung -fu pants." </b>Bre began. <b>"And to touch on a delicate subject, you'll want to change you're going to want to change your style of underwear." </b></p><p>"<b>Why?" </b>Lia asked.<b> "What for?" </b></p><p>"<b>Well... You like it when you can see his muscles, right?" </b>Bre asked.</p><p>"<b>Yeah." </b>Lia answered.</p><p>"<b>Well, it goes the same for him." </b>Bre said. <b>"You've got a nice shape, and he'd like to see it I'm sure, so thats why a change in underwear is order." </b></p><p>"<b>What kind of change are we talking about here?" </b>Lia asked.</p><p>"<b>Nothing major, just wear less baggier clothes, and... you're a ...what size?" </b>Bre asked.</p><p>"<b>C." </b></p><p>"<b>All right, all you need to do is switch to regular bras." </b>Bre said.</p><p>"<b>Thats it?" </b>Lia asked.</p><p>"<b>Thats it." </b>Bre said.</p><p>"<b>Huh." </b>Lia said to herself. <b>"Do you think help me when I go shopping?" </b></p><p>Bre perked up at the mention at the word 'shopping'.</p><p>"<b>Shopping?" </b>she asked. <b>"Uh-huh. Oh yeah." </b></p><p>The sudden chiming of her cell jarred Bre out of her slumber and into the waking world. Flailing around she she found her cell and picked it up.</p><p>"<b>in their right mind would be calling at this hour?" </b>she growled as she looked at the display, which read 'alarm'. She groaned and flopped face -first into her pillow. <b>"Who let it be morning?" </b>she growled.</p><p>A gentle knock on the door reminded her that the waking world was waiting and that she should get up.</p><p>"<b>Who is it?" </b>she asked.</p><p>"Nani?" answered a confused Matoko through the door.</p><p>Bre spun her tires for a moment as she tried to figure out why the person at her door was speaking Japanese. Then the rest of her brain kicked in and she remembered where she was.</p><p>"I'm up." Bre said, switching to Japanese. "Whats wrong?"</p><p>"Breakfast is ready." Matoko said.</p><p>"Oh." Bre said as she sat up in bed. Getting a whiff of herself she made a face and fanned the air. "I'll be in after I clean up."</p><p>"Alright." Matoko answered. "I'll set yours aside."</p><p>"Thanks." Bre said as she scowled at her cellphone.</p><p>After taking a couple of moments to get her bearings and convince herself to that she was awake Bre got to her feet and went down to the furo with a change of clothes. She found her bathing supplies already out and in her rinse pail along with fresh towels laid out.</p><p>Bre smiled at Matokos efficiency as she un-braided her hair and stripped out of her clothes. As she put her sleepwear into the hamper she idly noticed Lia pail was already set out as well.</p><p>Inside the furo proper there was a stool set out for her and the tub was full of steaming hot water. Taking her seat she began her morning bathing routine.</p><p>Meanwhile in the main room Lia was finishing up breakfast while Christian and Mamimi were beginning to get into theirs. Putting her chopsticks on her bowl Lia stretched and stood up.</p><p>"Well, that was delicious as usual." Lia said. "And now it's time for my bath."</p><p>"Didn't you take a bath last night?" Ranma asked, looking up from his own breakfast.</p><p>"Dad, you know I always take a bath before I have a major test." Lia answered. "It helps me get into the right frame of mind."</p><p>Her father blinked and then smacked himself on the forehead with the heel of his hand. "Of course, you have finals today." Ranma said. "Enjoy your bath."</p><p>"I will." Lia said as she picked up her dishes.</p><p>Lia deposited her dishes in the kitchen before heading to the furo. Normally Matoko would have been in there and would have warned Lia that Bre was using the furo, but she was upstairs trying to rouse her brother and his shadow from their slumber and was thus occupied.</p><p>NeverthelessRanma was not the least bit surprised when there was a surprised feminine shriek from the general direction of the furo.</p><p>"This is starting to be a routine." he muttered as he looked up.</p><p>Not hearing anymore screaming or other commotion from down the hall Ranma decided that it was under control and he wasn't needed. Shrugging he went back to his breakfast.</p><p>In the furo meanwhile Bre was trying to hide herself behind her washbasin while Lia had her ears folded back against the noise.</p><p>"What?" Lia asked.</p><p>'You're-you're-you're..." Bre stammered.</p><p>"Going to take a bath before I get ready for school." Lia said as she stepped into the furo and closed the door behind her. "This is no different than gym."</p><p>"But that was in <i>high school!</i>" Bre countered as Lia took out her stool.</p><p>"My point exactly." Lia said. "And besides, I have finals today, so I cant just wait for you to get finished because then I'd be late."</p><p>Bre blinked at Lias statement. "You have finals?" she asked.</p><p>"Uh-huh." Lia said.</p><p>"Oh." Bre said. "In that case I'll make an exception."</p><p>As Lia set out her supplies Bre went back to scrubbing. "I didn't know you'd be using the bath, or I wouldn't be in here." she said.</p><p>Lia nodded as she pulled out a bathing cap and put it on her head. "Oh, thats easy. If theres a pail out that means someone is going to be using it soon." she said.</p><p>"How do you tell each others apart? I mean, they're not marked." Bre said, pointing to the wash basin.</p><p>"Oh, thats easy." Lia said. "Just go by the scent of the bath products." Lia said picking up her body wash. "Mines cucumber, Matokos is lilac, Christian and Mamimis are orange, Moms is rose, and Dads is bubblegum."</p><p>Bre paused in her scrubbing as she looked at Lia. "Bubblegum?" she asked. "A guy using <i>bubblegum </i>scented soap? Isn't that kind of...well, <i>feminine?</i>"</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said. "But then again, so is he part of the time."</p><p>"True." Bre said with a nod. "So that's where you get your features." she said.</p><p>"Ahh..." Lia said as she paused and turned to look at Bre. "No one ever told you, did they?"</p><p>"Told me what?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Well... Lia began. "If you want to get technical, Ranma Saotome is my <i>mother </i>and Akane Saotome is my <i>father</i>."</p><p>"..." was all that Bre said as her brain digested that piece of info. Finally it started working again and she looked at Lia. "You mean that they...got it <i>backwards.</i>" she began.</p><p>"Uh -huh. But not intentionally." Lia confirmed with a nod."Thats also why Dad doesn't drink."</p><p>"Oh." Bre said. "And Christian?"</p><p>"He they had the other way." Lia said as she began to fill her rinse pail.</p><p>"Oh." Bre said. Feeling somewhat disoriented she decided to change the course of the conversation. "So, you have finals?"</p><p>"Yep." Lia answered as she finished filling her pail. Lifting it up she upended it over herself. "Brr-cold!" she said with a shiver.</p><p>"You worried about how you will do?" Bre asked as Lia reached for her soap.</p><p>"Nah." Lia said with a shake of her head. "I'm worried about Naota though."</p><p>"How come?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Well he wasn't the best student to begin with, and with his taking care of the Hagakure School it killed his grades." explained Lia. "He almost flunked out."</p><p>"Oh." Bre said. "So that you've been cramming with him."</p><p>"Uh-huh." Lia said as she scrubbed.</p><p>"So what happens after finals are over?" Bre asked.</p><p>Lia shrugged. "We get a week off while tests are graded and posted." she said.</p><p>"So you want to do the shopping trip then?" Bre asked while she filled her rinse pail.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said with a nod.</p><p>"Okay." Bre answered before rinsing herself off. "C-cold!" she said as she rinsed herself off.</p><p>"Bye Dad! See you when I get home!" Lia said as she walked to the hall. Stopping at the door she looked behind her at the stairs. "Christian! Mamimi! Lets go!"</p><p>There was a rumble of little feet across the ceiling and then down the stairs as the two children charged downstairs, nearly flatting Bre as she came in from the furo.</p><p>"Yikes!"she said as she flattened herself against the wall.</p><p>"Bye Dad bye Bre!" Christian said as he and Mamimi thundered through.</p><p>"Bye Christian." Ranma said. "Do good in school."</p><p>"Kay!"</p><p>"And you two break a leg." Ranma added as Matoko joined her sister.</p><p>"I'll try Ranma." Matoko said. "Though considering that this is Furinkan we're talking about, I don't think that is wisest thing to wish on someone."</p><p>"The scary part is that it's true." Ranma said with a shudder. "Well, do your best."</p><p>"We will Daddy." Lia said. "See you when we get home."</p><p>"See ya." Ranma said as they headed to the mudroom.</p><p>He sighed wistfully as Bre sat down at the table.</p><p>"Wishing you were their age again?" Bre asked as she began to dish herself breakfast.</p><p>"Ahhh..." Ranma said as he thought for a second. "No." he said with a shake of his head.</p><p>"Why not?" Bre asked, somewhat surprised at the answer.</p><p>"Well, for one thing when I was Lias age I had five suitors." Ranma said. "Plus a certain panda to deal with."</p><p>Still asleep, Genma sneezed and rolled over with a snort.</p><p>"Oh. Akane mentioned that the other day." Bre said. "That reminds me, why does Matoko call you and Akane by your given names rather than Mom or Dad?"</p><p>"Oh, that's because she and Lia were friends long before she became part of out family." explained Ranma. "We're still her mother and father, but she just prefers to call us by our first names."</p><p>"Okay." Bre said with a nod.</p><p>Sipping his tea Ranma debated whether he wanted fourths as Bre began to eat.</p><p>"I heard your shriek when Lia went to use the furo." he said casually as he looked over the miso soup.</p><p>"Yeah. Thats was an interesting surprise." Bre said between bites.</p><p>'Sorry about that." Ranma said as he dished himself some soup.</p><p>"It's okay." said Bre with a shrug. "About that though..."</p><p>"Yeah?" Ranma asked as he dug into his soup.</p><p>"I was thinking that since Naota moved into his own apartment that I'd move into his room at the Sanos." Bre said. "Don't take it the wrong way, I love living here, but-"</p><p>"It's okay." Ranma said gently. "You're an American through and through. It's a big adjustment living here."</p><p>"Oh." Bre said, somewhat surprised. "Thank you."</p><p>"You're welcome." Ranma said. "Lia went through the same thing when she moved here. You should have seen what happened with her first time in the furo."</p><p>"What happened?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Her Aunt Kasumi went in there to get cleaned up and Lia came tearing out of there in nothing but what she was born in and soap suds." Ranma said with a chuckle.</p><p>"You're kidding." Bre said.</p><p>"I have the photos in the family photo album." Ranma said. "You want to see?"</p><p>"Uh -huh." Bre said.</p><p>"Ah-CHOO!"</p><p>"Someones talking about you."</p><p>"No kidding Matoko- ah-CHOO!</p><p>Akane looked up when she heard the front door slam and the rumble of footsteps in the hall. Putting her folding down she stepped out into the hall as Christian and Mamimi charged past.</p><p>"Hi kids." she said. "How was school?"</p><p>"Okay." Christian and Mamimi chorused as they charged up the stairs.</p><p>"Christian, where are your sisters?" Akane hollered up the stairs. Hearing the front door slam again answered her question. "Never mind."</p><p>Walking through the main room Akane stepped into the hall as Lia and Matoko came in, followed by Kenji and Naota.</p><p>"Hey kids." Akane said. "How were finals?"</p><p>Getting a variety of groans in reply Akane laughed and stepped back into the main room.</p><p>"That bad, huh?" she asked. "Well, sit down and I'll get you a snack."</p><p>The four of them flopped down at the table, totally spent. Thumping his head on the table Naota groaned.</p><p>"My brain is goo." he said.</p><p>"Mine too." Lia said.</p><p>"Well, at least it's over with." Kenji said. "Now all we have to do is wait."</p><p>"Uh-huh." Naota said. "I hope I passed."</p><p>"You should have." Lia said. "With all that cramming you did."</p><p>"Thanks for the vote of confidence." Naota said as he covered his head with his arms.</p><p>"You're welcome." Lia said as her mother came in with a tray of snacks. "Foods here."</p><p>"Here you go." Akane said as she placed the tray on the table. "Bre made these."</p><p>"That was nice of her." Matoko said as she took a cookie.</p><p>"You're welcome." Bre answered as she stepped out of the kitchen. "How are they?"</p><p>"Good." Matoko said as Lia took a cookie.</p><p>Nibbling on the cookie Lia nodded enthusiastically as she chowed down. Watching the teenagers eat Bres thoughts went back to that morning and a giggle rose up in her throat. As she smothered it Naotas ears twitched and he looked up.</p><p>"What''s so funny?" he asked.</p><p>"Just thinking of some photos Ranma showed me." Bre said.</p><p>Lias ears pricked up when she heard Bres statement. "What photos?" she asked. "Were they from when I first got here?"</p><p>Red faced from trying to keep from laughing Bre nodded in reply. Putting her cookie down Lia stood up and summoned a mallet.</p><p>'Excuse me for a second." she said as her tail bristled out to twice its original size "I have to go talk to Daddy."</p><p>Naota watched Lia as she stalked off to the dojo with her mallet at the ready.</p><p>"Should we be worried?" he asked.</p><p>"No." Akane said. 'Though you should get ready to duck. Sometimes Lia doesn't watch her back swing."</p><p>"Okay..." Naota said.</p><p>"DADDY NO BAKA!" came Lias scream a millisecond before the house shook from a mallet impact.</p><p>In the silence that followed afterwards Akane frowned and scratched her head.</p><p>"That didn't sound like a normal mallet hit..." she said. "But it's somehow familiar." Akane added as Lia came in, <i>sans </i>mallet.</p><p>"Mom, you might want to take over Daddy's class." Lia said as she sat down.</p><p>"Why?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I put him through the floorboards." Lia answered as she picked up her cookie.</p><p>"Yiggg-gg-ggh..." Akane said as she hurried off to the dojo.</p><p>"Ah, Lia, I have a question." Naota said.</p><p>"Yeah?" Lia asked.</p><p>"How did you manage to clock your father with mallet? Half the time I can't even land a punch." Naota said.</p><p>"He was teaching the class and I used the Umi -Sen -Ken." Lia said.</p><p>"Oh." Naota said. "Whats so embarrassing about those photos?"</p><p>"Lets just say my transition into Japanese life was a little rough." Lia said. "And leave it at that."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said.</p><p>"Hey Lia." Bre said.</p><p>"Yeah?" Lia asked as she grabbed another cookie.</p><p>"You know, I've found one of the best cures for parental embarrassment is shopping." Bre suggested. "So how about we go pick up those accessories you wanted?"</p><p>"Okay." Lia said. "But let me go change first."</p><p>"Okay. I'll be here." Bre said as she sat down.</p><p>"So, where do you want to start?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Ah..." Lia said as she stared in open -mouthed shock at the interior of the store. "Eep!" she squeaked when she saw what looked like a patch of lace and a couple of shoe -strings.</p><p>Seeing what Lia was looking at Bre giggled and guided Lia away.</p><p>"Thats a little too much for you Lia." Bre said gently. "What we're looking for is over here I think."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said as she began to turn beet red.</p><p>"Can I help you?" a clerk asked as she walked up to them.</p><p>'Ah, yes." Bre said. "We're looking for something in a C-cup that has good support and."</p><p>Taking a look at Lia the clerk smiled and winked at Bre. "And looks good too, I take it?" she asked.</p><p>"Uh-huh." Bre said with a nod. "Boyfriend." she whispered conspiratorially.</p><p>"Thought so." the clerk whispered back. Turning to Lia she smiled and took her by the arm. "Come dear, lets get you fixed up. I think we have something over here..."</p><p>"Eep." Lia squeaked as she led away, Bre following behind.</p><p>An hour later Lia had made a few selections when Bre tapped her on the shoulder.</p><p>"Hey, Kitty, I'm feeling a little worn right now." she said. "You mind if I go sit down for a bit?"</p><p>"Not at all." Lia answered. "And 'Kitty?'"</p><p>"Well, it fits, don't it?" Bre asked, gently flicking an ear.</p><p>"True." Lia said with a nod. "Go sit down."</p><p>"Okay." Bre said before she turned around and walked away.</p><p>Lia watched Bre go for a second before turning back to the clerk.</p><p>"May I ask a question?" the clerk asked.</p><p>'Sure." Lia said.</p><p>"The guy you're buying this for isn't your boyfriend, isn't it?" the clerk asked. "It's for your mate."</p><p>Lias eyes bugged out as she looked at the clerk. "H-how?" she whispered.</p><p>The clerk gave Lia a knowing smirk and tapped the side of her nose.</p><p>"Scent." she said. "I smelled it right off. That, and your mark is showing." she added, pointing to Lias neck.</p><p>"Erk!" Lia grimaced and quickly flipped her pigtail over to cover it. "I thought I had that covered." she muttered.</p><p>"It's okay." the clerk said. Leaning closer she sniffed the air and looked questioningly at Lia. "So, who is he, your mate?"</p><p>"Why do you want to know?" Lia asked, suddenly on guard.</p><p>"Well, there have been rumors of a new tai-yokai running around lately, and everyone wants to know who this mystery demon is." the clerk answered. "And by the smell of it, your mate is a tai-yokai."</p><p>'Oh." Lia said.</p><p>'So..." the clerk continued. "Who is he, and more importantly, does he have any single brothers?"</p><p>Lia blanched at the clerks question for a moment, then shook her head.</p><p>"Ah no, he's only got the one sister." she said, pointing to Bre.</p><p>"Phooey. All the good ones are taken." the clerk sighed.</p><p>"It's okay." Lia said. "By the way, what are you?"</p><p>"Me?" the clerk asked, pointing to herself. Getting a nod she continued. "I'm a kitsune(3)."</p><p>"Oh." Lia said. Sniffing the air her ears folded back in surprise. "Hey, you're right. You smell like a dog."</p><p>The clerk grimaced at Lias choice of language and held up her hands. "Ah, a word of advice: Don't group us with dogs, please." she said. "It's considered an insult."</p><p>"Sorry." Lia said sheepishly.</p><p>"Anyways, is this it?" the clerk asked, pointing to a few bras and matching panties.</p><p>'Yeah." Lia said with a nod. "Ring them up."</p><p>"Will do." the clerk said as she picked up the various pieces of lingerie.</p><p>After paying for the items and having them bagged in a plain brown bag Lia bowed to the clerk and headed for the store.</p><p>"Be sure to tell me how he likes them." the clerk said as Lia left.</p><p>"Ah-okay." Lia said as she nodded jerkily, trying to keep from blushing and failing.</p><p>Stepping outside Lia spotted Bre sitting on a bench, her knees drawn up to her chin. As she approached Bre she saw that the older girl was rocking slightly back and forth.</p><p>"You okay Bre?" Lia asked as she approached.</p><p>"Huh?" Bre asked as she looked up. "Yeah I'm okay, I think. Just got hit with culture shock."</p><p>"Oh." Lia said. "You want to go home?"</p><p>"Yeah." Bre said with a nod. "And when we get there could you call Evans for me?" she asked.</p><p>Lia nodded . "Yeah. Lets go Bre." she said as she held out her hand.</p><p>Taking Lias hand Bre got to her feet and followed Lia home to the Saotome home.</p><p>A week later the day the finals results were posted came around and the Saotome daughters trudged to their high school, along with their cousin. Stepping onto the school grounds the saw the crowd around the billboards.</p><p>'There they are." Lia said, nodding in the direction of the mob.</p><p>"Yeah." Izu said. "No sense in postponing it. Lets get this over with." he said as he started walking.</p><p>"Yes, lets." Lia sighed as she and Matoko started after him.</p><p>Threading their way through the crowd to the bill boards they began to scan through the list of names.</p><p>"I graduated." Matoko said as she pointed out her name. "Top of the class too."</p><p>"So did I." Izu said. "Thank whatever deity is looking over me."</p><p>"What about you Lia?" Matoko asked, looking down at her sister.</p><p>"I can't see a bloody thing." Lia said. "There are too many people in the way. Could you check for me?"</p><p>"Certainly."Matoko said as she scanned the list again, finding Lias posting on the bottom of the list. "I found it."</p><p>"And?" Lia asked.</p><p>"You passed." Matoko said. 'You were middle of the class."</p><p>"Cool." Lia said. "I wonder how Naota and Kenji did?"</p><p>"YA-HOO!"</p><p>"Never mind." Lia said. "So now what?"</p><p>"Well, we have to go the auditorium." Matoko said. "The principal has an announcement to make."</p><p>"Hmmph." Lia snorted. "I wonder what Pineapple Brain is up to this time."</p><p>"Probably nothing intelligent." Izu said as they separated from the crowd.</p><p>"Probably." Lia agreed.</p><p>Ranma looked up when a shadow fell across him.</p><p>"Yes?" he asked.</p><p>"Just making sure your okay." Akane said.</p><p>"I'm fine." answered Ranma. "I just can't believe Lia did that."</p><p>'I can." Akane said. "She is, after all, my daughter."</p><p>"You had better believe it." Ranma said. Perking up he looked to the front of the house. "Speaking of children, I believe they're home from school."</p><p>"Oh, shoot." Akane said. "I was hoping we could have some fun."</p><p>"Oh don't worry." Ranma said. "Theres always bedtime." he said with a smirk.</p><p>"Hentai." Akane said as she stepped into the hall. She stopped dead when she saw what Lia and her peers looked like. "What happened?"</p><p>"A party." Lia answered.</p><p>"A party? Why?" Akane asked. "Graduation isn't for another month and a half."</p><p>"Oh, it was because Principal Kuno is retiring." Lia explained.</p><p>"Did I hear Pineapple Brain is retiring?" Ranma asked as he stuck his head out the door.</p><p>"Uh-huh." Lia confirmed.</p><p>"Sweet!" Ranma said as he punched his fist in the air. His elation was short lived when a realization dawned on him. "Uh -oh. I had better go warn Tatewaki and Nabiki."</p><p>"Good idea." Akane said as Ranma went back into the main room. "And on a related subject, did everyone pass?"</p><p>"Yep." Lia said. "Matoko was top of the class, I was in the middle, Izu...well he passed, and so did Naota and Kenji."</p><p>"By half a point." added Naota. "I think there was a guardian angel looking out for me."</p><p>"Well, congratulations to all of you." Akane said. "So, how do you want to celebrate?" she asked.</p><p>"We were thinking of having a little 'Free at Last' party at me and Kenjis place." Naota said. "If that's all right with you and Ranma, that is."</p><p>"It's fine. After all, all of you are pretty responsible."Akane said. "Besides, around here the biggest treat is that you'll accidentally defeat an Amazon."</p><p>That prompted a shudder through the entire group as Akane chuckled.</p><p>"Anyways, come on in. You can start planning your party while I get some snacks." Akane said as she turned around.</p><p>Lia hummed to herself as she came down the stairs from her room. Her hair was down out of its customary pigtail and brushed until it shone, and instead of wearing her usual baggy tang Lia had on a fitted Chinese -styled blouse and kung -fu pants.</p><p>'Well someones dressed nice." Akane said as she looked up from the table. "I wonder who the lucky guy is."</p><p>"Moom" Lia groaned as she rolled her eyes. "We're celebrating the fact we survived high school. I think getting a little dressed up is in order."</p><p>"Uh-huh. Just don't let your father see you." Akane said. "He'll lose it."</p><p>"That I can do." Lia said. "Wheres Matoko?"</p><p>"In here." Matoko called from the kitchen.</p><p>'You ready?" Lia asked.</p><p>"I'm ready." Matoko said as she came out of the kitchen carrying a plastic container. "And so are my world famous fudge and chocolate -chip cookies."</p><p>"Ooh...Yummy." Lia said as she rubbed her hands together. "Well, lets get going."</p><p>"Have fun you two." Akane said as they walked into the hall. "And don't stay out too late."</p><p>"We won't." Lia answered.</p><p>It was going on eleven PM when the chiming of a cell phone intruded on Kenjis retelling of the 'Salamis incident'.</p><p>"I got it." Naota said as he got up. Flipping open his phone he pressed the talk button. "Yo."</p><p>Naota listened to the person on the other end talk for a moment, nodding occasionally. "Uh-huh. Yeah. We're there." he said before hanging up.</p><p>"Who was that?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Hideo. Theres a LAN party going on. Anybody game?" Naota said as Kenjis arm shot up. "Besides Kenji I mean."</p><p>Matoko and Lia looked at each other and shrugged. "We're up to it." Lia said.</p><p>"Okay." Naota said. "Kenji, why don't you and Matoko head over while Lia and button up the apartment?"</p><p>"Okay." Kenji said as he started to get up.</p><p>"Where are we going?" Matoko asked Kenji helped her to her feet.</p><p>"Hideos." Kenji answered. "Don't worry. He'll be on good behavior."</p><p>"Okay." Matoko said, not entirely convinced.</p><p>Grabbing their coats Kenji and Matoko left, leaving Lia and Naota alone in the apartment. Lia whistled as she looked around at the apartment.</p><p>"Boy, what a mess." she said.</p><p>"No kidding." Naota answered. "We had better clean up."</p><p>"Yeah." Lia agreed.</p><p>Grabbing a tray Lia began to gather up the dirty dishes while Naota gathered up the empty soda cans lying about.</p><p>"Honestly, I don't how Kenji can drink this stuff." he said as he put the umpteenth can into the bin.</p><p>""Yeah." agreed Lia.</p><p>Stopping to fan herself Lia undid the first three ties of her blouse, something that was not unnoticed by Naota. And when she bent back over to finish cleaning up the table he got a glimpse of Lias considerable cleavage.</p><p>"<i>Eyes front Naota. You can't go peeking at her cleavage- waitaminute, cleavage?" </i>Naota thought to himself. <i>"Since when did Lia start wearing bras that </i>show <i>cleavage? And why am I telling myself not to look? We made it to the end. We haven't graduated yet, but we passed, so a quick look is okay." </i>he reasoned.</p><p>Taking another glimpse Naota saw a flash of purple lace, which made him lose track of what he was doing and accidentally bump his head into Kenjis wastebasket. Growling in irritation he ran his hand through his hair to get the paper scraps out.</p><p>Lia looked up when she heard him growl and giggled at what she saw.</p><p>"What?" Naota asked.</p><p>"You missed one." Lia said. Seeing Naota paw at his hair some more she giggled again and walked over to him. "Here, let me get it." she said.</p><p>Reaching up she plucked a small scrap of paper from next to Naotas left ear and held it out in front of him.</p><p>"Here, see?" she asked.</p><p>Naota looked at it and then up at Lia.</p><p>"<i>Wow, her eyes are really pretty..." </i>he thought as an idea sprung into his head. <i>"Why not?" </i>he asked, throwing caution to the wind.</p><p>Seeing the concentrated look come onto Naotas face Lia tilted her head to one side. "Is something wrong?" she asked as he leaned in close to her. "Naota?" she asked before he put his lips to hers.</p><p>For a moment all of Lias thoughts were blotted out as their lips met and Naotas tongue gently probed hers. When her senses returned Lia decided that this time she was going to return the kiss, and damn the consequences.</p><p>Pulling each other into an embrace they kissed for several long seconds before breaking apart. Panting slightly Lia looked up into eyes.</p><p>"do you?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes." Naota answered before his lips met hers again.</p><p>End.</p><p><i>To be continued in Book Five, Chapter One.</i></p><p>That's a US Army base in Japan.</p><p>Or as everyone had started to refer to it, Chris -chan.</p><p>Fox. A trickster in Japanese folklore, much like coyotes are in Native American folklore.</p>
