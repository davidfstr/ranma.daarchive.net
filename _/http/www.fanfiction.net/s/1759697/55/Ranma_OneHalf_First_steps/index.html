</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter 11.</p><p>As the first blush of dawn began to color the eastern sky over the mountains of Japan the town of Mabase was already beginning to stir. Shop owners were already beginning to get ready for the day as their children  slept, delivery vehicles were finishing up their deliveries prior to their customers opening for business, and the ninjas of the night watch began to turn in.</p><p>For all it's appearance as a typical Japanese small mountain town, Mabase was anything but. For the valley the town is nestled in is actually the ancestral home of the Hagakure clan, a very old, very strong, and very active ninja clan.</p><p>Almost all of the the families living in Mabase are members of the Hagakure clan, and there are several members of those families who are actually practicing ninjas of one form or another. This is something that is not shared with outsiders.</p><p>And in keeping with tradition, the Hagakure clan still posted guards to patrol the clan's territory and be on the lookout for intruders. This would come as a surprise to the four policemen assigned to the town(1).</p><p>Tucked in amongst the other buildings in the town the lights in the Sano house burned as they went about their business, getting breakfast ready and preparing to open their print shop for the day.</p><p>The house itself was a rather large traditional Japanese house, having originally been an inn before the Sano family had acquired it. They had expanded it over the generations as they saw fit, to it's current configuration of two and a half stories, surrounding a courtyard with a separate 'guest room'.</p><p>In this 'guest room' slept Naota Sano, Hagakure ninja, hacker extrodinar, sniper, infiltration expert, and taii-yokai with his mate and newest addition to the Sano family by way of marriage, Lia.</p><p>They were curled up on their futon with Naota having his arm around Lia, who was sleeping like a rock. Naota on the other hand was sleeping very lightly, as per the norm with him. So when he heard the screen slide open he was instantly awake, SOCOM in hand as he pushed himself up on one elbow to face the threat.</p><p>Kneeling at the door, frozen like a deer in the headlights, Tomoe blinked as she looked down the barrel of Naotas pistol.</p><p>"You're up early." Naota said as he flipped the safety on.</p><p>Tomoe nodded as she held up the bundle in her hands. "I-I-I'm bringing you fresh towels." she stammered.</p><p>Glancing at the towels she carried Naota nodded. "Okay. Sorry for startling you." he said as Lia, feeling a draft nyaowed and tried to snuggle up to Naota.</p><p>"It's okay." Tomoe said as she got up and padded towards the bathroom, trying not to blush from having gotten a whole eyeful of her cousin and his wife's bare flesh.</p><p>Putting the towels away and picking up the used ones Tomoe hurried back out, trying not to look at the purring lumps on the futon. Sliding the door closed behind her Tomoe sighed and shook her head. Walking along the porch she headed back into the main house.</p><p>Coming into the kitchen Tomoe found Masumi in there, who looked up from the stove at her arrival..</p><p>"You okay?" she asked as Tomoe leaned against the wall.</p><p>"They were naked!" exclaimed Tomoe in a very flustered tone. "Naked!"</p><p>Masumi laughed as she checked what was cooking on the stove. "I would hope so." she said. "They <i>are </i>newlyweds after all."</p><p>Tomoe gaped at her aunt. "Hello? Are you <i>listening </i>to me? <i>Naked?</i>"</p><p>Masumi nodded and looked over her shoulder at her niece. "Yes, I heard you Tomoe." she said. "But you're a big girl now, so I don't think I have to explain to you <i>why </i>they were naked. Now so put those towels away and get the table set. Your father is coming off night watch."</p><p>Tomoe gaped at her aunt for a few moments ,opened her mouth to say something, thought better of it and walked down the hall shaking her head. Chuckling, Masumi went back to her cooking and checked the miso soup.</p><p>The <i>thump </i>of the genkan door told Masumi that Tomoe's father had just came home from his shift on the night watch, followed a few moments later by the arrival of him in the kitchen.</p><p>"Hi Hiezo." Masumi greeted her brother as he came in. "Sit down. I'll make you a cup of tea."</p><p>"Thanks 'Sumi." Hiezo answered as he sat down at the kitchen table. "Did Naota make it in yesterday?"</p><p>Masumi nodded as she poured hot water into a cup. "Yeah. He and his wife got in last night." she said as she put in a teabag. "They make a nice couple."</p><p>Hiezo nodded as Masumi came over with his tea. "ah." he said. "She know about us?" he asked.</p><p>Masumi nodded yes to the unspoken reference about the clan. "Yeah, she knows." she said. "It looks like she's okay with it." Masumi added, getting a nod from Hiezo.</p><p>"Okay." he said before taking a sip of his tea. "mmm... they're in the guest room?"</p><p>"Yeah." Masumi answered as she took a couple of bowls out of the cupboard. "That reminds me, Tomoes a little worked up about them."</p><p>Hiezo arched an eyebrow as Masumi began to dish up some rice. "Why?" he asked.</p><p>Masumi chuckled as she put the rice bowl down. "She was bringing them some fresh towels and walked in on them lying in bed naked."</p><p>Hiezo laughed as Masumi began to ladle soup into the other bowl. "They're newlyweds. That's what they're supposed to be doing." he said.</p><p>"Thats what I told her." Masumi said as she picked up the bowls and began to bring them over. "But you know how she is."</p><p>Hiezo chuckled as he took a pair pf chopsticks from the jar in the center of the table and dug in. A few moments later Tomoe came back in, having finished with the laundry.</p><p>"Oh, you already got yourself some..." said Tomoe as she glanced at the table.</p><p>Hiezo nodded before having some tea. "Yeah." he said as he put down is cup. "I heard about your interesting encounter with your cousin."</p><p>Tomoe rolled her eyes and threw her hands up in the air. "What is <i>with </i>this family?" she asked. "I suppose the fact that Naota pulled a gun on me is funny too?"</p><p>"N sot really." Hiezo said. "Your cousin <i>is </i>a chuunin-."</p><p>"Jounin." interrupted Masumi, which got a surprised look from Hiezo.</p><p>"Really?" he asked. "Since when?"</p><p>Masumi gave Hiezo a puzzled look of her own. "Hiezo, he's eighteen. He's been one for a couple years."</p><p>"Ah." Hiezo said with a nod.</p><p>Tomoe stared slack -jawed at her father and aunt as they conversed. "My family is insane... " she said to herself as she shook her head. Glancing at the clock Tomoe saw that it was almost time for her to get to school. "And I'm outta here." she said as she left.</p><p>"Have fun at school." Hiezo called after his daughter. Turning around he faced Masumi. "So, Naota's a jonin now...huh."</p><p>Masumi shrugged as she leaned against the counter. "They grow up quick in the School." she said. "But, then again, everyone in the clan does."</p><p>Hiezo looked down into his teacup. "Some of us grow up a little faster than others." he said. "Naota hasn't had what you'd call a normal life since he was five."</p><p>Masumi nodded as she pushed herself away from the counter. "True." she said. "Kamone did a pretty good job of raising him." she added. "A pity they're on bad terms."</p><p>Hiezo arched his eyebrows in surprise. "They are? Why?" he asked.</p><p>Masumi shrugged as she began to make herself another cup of tea. "You remember Kamone's first kid? The one he put up for adoption?" she asked, getting a nod of confirmation nod from Hiezo. "Well, she came back."</p><p>Hiezo winced. "Ouch. A sister that you never knew you had? That'd do it." he said. "Where was she sent?"</p><p>Masumi shrugged. "America." she answered. "And the corker is the town she ended up in is just outside the city where Naotas wife was born."</p><p>Hiezo blinked as he looked at Masumi. "You're kidding me." he said, getting a shake of the head from Masumi.</p><p>"Kamone was right." Hiezo sighed. "There's never a dull moment in Nerima."</p><p>Masumi gave her brother a smile as she brought her tea to her lips. "And now the chaos is here in Mabase." she said.</p><p>"Joy."</p><p></p><p>Lia lay on her side, curled up against Naota. He had his arm around her protectively as he curled around her. The only sounds were the those of the town outside and the birds.</p><p>With the twitch of an ear, Naota began to stir. Cracking open an eye the first thing he saw was one of Lia's ears in a sea of red hair. Tilting his head back he glanced at the clock, which showed that it was going on eleven.</p><p>Smiling slightly Naota gently shook Lia. "Lia, wake up." he said.</p><p>Lia's response was to nyaow softly and curl up tighter. Shaking her again and getting the same reaction, Naota decided on a different tack. Reaching up he began to scratch Lia behind the ears.</p><p>"Lia, wake up." Naota said again.</p><p>This time he got a different reaction from Lia. She made a sound like a cross between a purr and a nyaow and uncurled from the position she was in, arching backwards and rolling over slightly as her eyes fluttered open.</p><p>"Nyaow?" she asked when she saw Naota.</p><p>"Rise and shine sleepyhead." answered Naota, his smile getting bigger.</p><p>Blinking again Lia yawned and snuggled up against Naota. "It's too early... wanna go back to sleep." she murred.</p><p><i>That </i>made Naotas smile crack into a grin.</p><p>"Lia, it's eleven o'clock." he said. "If we don't get out of bed soon we'll miss Aunt Masumi's breakfast."</p><p>Lia groaned and covered her face with her arm. "Does she cook as good as Kasumi of Matoko?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota answered.</p><p>"Do I have to get dressed up?" Lia asked, bringing her arm down to look at Naota with one green eye.</p><p>"Well, we do have to get <i>dressed</i>." Naota said with a laugh, indicating their current nakedness. "But nothing fancy. Your sleep shirt with a pair of shorts would be ok."</p><p>Lia groaned again and her arm flopped to her side. "Ok." she sighed. Glancing at Naota she gave him a small smile. "But I'm going to need your help with brushing my hair."</p><p>Naota brightened at that. Brushing Lia's hair? This looked it had the makings of a good day...</p><p>"You going to put it up in a pigtail?" he asked as he levered himself up to a sitting position. "Or you gonna leave it down?" he asked, casting about for Lia's brush.</p><p>"I'm just going to tie it back." Lia said as she rolled over and sat up. "I'm not in the mood to mess with it right now."</p><p>Naota grinned at the thought of Lia with her hair down. Even better. Spotting Lia's brush Naota got to his feet as Lia arranged herself. Retrieving the brush Naota knelt down behind her.</p><p>"So." Lia said as Naota took a handful of hair and started brushing. "Who do you think put the catnip in our bags?"</p><p>Naota snorted as he brushed. "Who else? A certain little sometimes redhead we both know."</p><p></p><p>"Ah-choo!"</p><p>"Bless you Chris -chan!"</p><p></p><p>Lia's mouth quirked into a smile as she started to purr. "So what do you want to do?" she asked. "When we get back?"</p><p>Naota shrugged as he continued to keep brushing Lia's hair. "I'm thinking something with kimonos..." he said.</p><p>Lia laughed at that thought. "Ooohh... that's <i>evil</i>." she said.</p><p>"Thats what he gets for messing with my luggage." Naota shot back. "You mess with a ninja, you better be prepared to deal with the consequences."</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere in Nerima Christian shivered as an icy chill ran up his spine.<p>"Are you okay?" asked Manmimi.</p><p>"I think Naota figured out about the catnip."</p><p>"Uh -oh."</p><p></p><p>Asako leaned against a pillar and watched as the crowds of Tokyo streamed past her. They were salarymen, office ladies, and various other white collar professionals heading out to lunch, meet with clients, etc.</p><p>Unnoticed by everyone except her a T.P.D.C.D.(1) Mecha  picked it's way through the traffic on patrol. Out of the corner of her eye she spotted Takata towering head and shoulders above the rest of the crowd.</p><p>Waving her hand she got Takata's attention and waited for him to thread his way through the crowd to her.</p><p>"Hey Asako." Takata said as hi came up to her. "You ready for lunch?"</p><p>Asako nodded as they fell into step with each other. "So, just where is this place?" she asked, to which Takata smiled.</p><p>"Follow me." he said.</p><p>Takata then proceeded to lead them on a meandering trip over six blocks and down an alley to a small diner tucked in between a couple of storefronts.</p><p>"That's it?" she asked, taking in the unassuming facade of the restaurant. "That's the place?" she asked again, getting a confirming nod from Takata.</p><p>"That's it." Takata said as he opened the door and led them inside. "Has the best sukiyaki in Tokyo."</p><p>Inside the diner was dark and cozy, with stools along the counter and booths along the wall. The décor was surprisingly traditional, with lots of wood and lacquer, and the staff dressed in kimonos and other traditional garb.</p><p>"Nice." Asako said as Takata nodded to the man behind the bar. Seeing the gesture she looked out of the corner of her eye at Takata. "You come here often." she said in a sly tone.</p><p>Takata nodded as they sat down in a booth. "Yeah. And they deliver too." he said as a waitress came up to them.</p><p>"What'll it be Takata?" the waitress asked as s he took out her notepad.</p><p>"A menu for her." he said to the waitress, nodding to Asako. "And I'll have the special." he added as the waitress jotted down his order.</p><p>"Okay. And to drink?" the waitress asked.</p><p>"Tea." Takata answered.</p><p>"Sake." Asako answered.</p><p>The waitress nodded as she took down their drinks. "I'll get those to you and a menu." she said. "When you're ready to order let me know."</p><p>They nodded as the waitress walked away and then found themselves looking at each other with nothing to say.</p><p>"So..." Takata said, breaking the ice. "What's up?"</p><p>Asako shrugged. "Just the usual kitsune stuff." she said.</p><p>Takata arched his eyebrows. "Oh? And what would that be?" he asked.</p><p>Asako gave him a sly grin. "Well..." she drawled. "For starters, a couple of Sesshy -Poo's retainers tried to grab me this morning."</p><p>Takata gave her a surprised look. "They tried to grab you? What for?" he asked, getting another shrug from Asako.</p><p>"They probably wanted to talk to me about Naota." she said as the waitress came up with their drinks.</p><p>"There you are..." the waitress said as she put Takata's coffee down in front of him. "There's your coffee, and your sake." she added as she put Asakos drink in front of her. "And here's your menu."</p><p>"Thank you." Asako said as she took the menu. "Let me take a look at the menu and I'll let you know when I'm ready to order."</p><p>The waitress nodded and walked away to another of her tables as Asako opened the menu and began to peruse the menu. Waiting until she was out of earshot Takata leaned in to her.</p><p>"So?" he asked.</p><p>Looking over the edge of the menu at Takata Asako arched an eyebrow. "So what?" she asked.</p><p>"So what did you do about the two goons?" he asked.</p><p>Asako gave Takata a smirk as she leaned in close to Takata. "Not much. Just a little flash of cleavage and thigh was all it took."</p><p>"You enjoy doing that, don't you?" Takata asked, taking in Asako's smirk and the mischievous glint in her eye. "You're such a flirt."</p><p>"</p><p>Asako grinned and gave him a quick nod. "Uh -huh." she said. "And I'm proud of it." she added, getting a laugh from Takata.</p><p>"Are all kitsunes that way?" Takata asked.</p><p>Asako shrugged slightly. "mostly. Some of us are more prankster than flirt." she said. "And some of us are both."</p><p>"So <i>thats </i>why you were talking to Christian." Takata said as Asako feigned innocence.</p><p>"Possibly." she said. "By the way, that hanyou, Hideo."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Do you know if he's single? I happen to know a vixen his age..." Asako began.</p><p>"Hideo? Yeah, he's single." Takata said, arcing his eyebrows. "But are you nuts? He's a hentai."</p><p>"Oh, I know." Asako said with a nod. "But remember, she's a kitsune."</p><p>"True." Takata agreed. "But, still, it feels strange though, talking about setting up <i>Hideo </i>with a date."</p><p>Asako gave Takata a sly look. "You think this is strange? Wait until your daughter brings home a boy."</p><p>Takata 'hunhed' as he looked down at his coffee. "<i>That </i>is not going to happen because I will kill any boy that even <i>thinks </i>about getting close to her." he said as Asako stifled a giggle. "What's so funny?" he asked, giving her an odd look.</p><p>"You sound exactly like my father." Asako said.</p><p>"Your father?" Takata asked.</p><p>"Uh -huh. He's a nine tail." Asako said, which got a surprised look form Takata.</p><p>"He's a nine tail." he asked.</p><p>"Yep." Asako said. "He's Kyuubi, the Fox Lord."</p><p>"So, you're..."</p><p>Asako grinned. "A princess." she said. "Literally and figuratively."</p><p>"Oh." Takata said. "You have any siblings?"</p><p>"I'm the oldest of nine." Asako answered.</p><p>Takata whistled as he picked up his coffee. "How do they find time for sleep?' he asked.</p><p>Asako shrugged. "Well, when you spread them out over six hundred years it's not so bad..."</p><p>"Well, that makes sense." Takata said with a nod. "So what are your bothers and sisters like?"</p><p>Asako shrugged. "Oh, we're a crazy bunch." she said as a thought dawned on her. "Oh <i>crud." </i></p><p>"What?" asked Takata.</p><p>Asako sighed as she sat her menu down and looked at Takata. "I just remembered. One of my brothers is sealed in a shrine in Mabase."</p><p>"Is he dangerous?" Takata asked, gettiing a shake of the head from Asako.</p><p>"No. Not at all. He's just a womanizer." Asako said. "In fact, that's what got him sealed. He seduced a miko's sister."</p><p>"Ah. So you think he might become unsealed?" Takata asked, getting a slight shrug from Asako.</p><p>"Could be.' she answered. "The shrine he's in has some real wards on it, not like what you'd find around here. So it'd depend if Naota could approach the shrine."</p><p>"And if he can?" Takata asked.</p><p>"Well, then, since he's a tai -youkai and the wards are for a three tailed kitsune, odds are they'll come crashing down." answered Asako. "But if they do, I'd love to see my brother." she added. "The last time we saw each other I was just a four -tail."</p><p>Takata chuckled as he picked up his coffee. "Well, there are two residents of Nerima wandering around Mabase. I'm sure they'll be able to do something."</p><p></p><p>Lia and Naota sneezed simultaneously.</p><p>"Someone was talking about us.' Lia said.</p><p>"You think?" asked Naota, rubbing his nose.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said with a nod and a smile, getting a laugh from Naota.</p><p>They were wandering along a street in Mabase as Naota showed Lia the town. It was a beautiful midsummers afternoon, with a few clouds in the sky. They were both dressed fairly casually, with Lia wearing a dark red sleeveless knee length Chinese tang with black capri pants, and Naota in a A -line t shirt and cargo shorts.</p><p>Rounding a curve in the road they heard the sound of an approaching truck and stepped aside to let it pass. After it had passed by Naota nudged Lia in the side.</p><p>"Hey, you ready for the fun part?" he asked.</p><p>Lia nodded. "Yeah." she said.</p><p>"Cool. Follow me." Naota said before he crossed the road.</p><p>"Uuh, Naota, that's forest." Lia said as she crossed after him.</p><p>"Yeah." answered Naota as Lia came up to him.</p><p>"So why are we going <i>into </i>it?" Lia asked as Naota parted the bushes and stepped through.</p><p>"You remember the play?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Yeah." answered Lia.</p><p>"You remember how Oto, Matada, and Fujiko went cross country" asked Naota as he beckoned for Lia top follow him.</p><p>"A secret road." Lia said as she stepped past Naota.</p><p>"Yep." Naota answered as he put the brush back.</p><p>"So, where is it?" Lia asked as she looked around.</p><p>"Up the hill a ways." Naota said, nodding in the direction of the hill. "It's kept hidden."</p><p>"Okay..." Lia said. "So how do we get through the brush?"</p><p>Naota smirked as he looked up. "We don't." he said. "We go above it."</p><p>"Huh?" was Lia asked, looking up and seeing nothing but branches above them. "I don't see anything."</p><p>Naota laughed. "You're not supposed to." he said. "But it dosen't mean that it's not there."</p><p>Completely puzzled by then Lia shook her head. "I don't get it." she said.</p><p>Naota gave her another smirk. "Follow me." he said. He then easily hopped up to a nearby branch, then easily stepped over to another branch, then to another. "See?" he asked.</p><p>"Clever." Lia said before jumping lightly to the first branch.</p><p>They then went up the hillside, hopping from branch to branch. At the top of the hill Naota dropped down behind a screen of bushes to a patch of sand, of all things.</p><p>Landing beside Naota Lia was surprised to see that the little clearing was much like the set they had in the play, with a pair of benches made of split logs with the bushes branching up to form a canopy, and the sand bordered by large flat stones.</p><p>"Nice." Lia said as she looked around at the clearing.</p><p>"Thank you." Naota answered as he stepped over to the bushes and pushed them aside, revealing a very faint trail. "Before we get going, there's something you should know."</p><p>"really?" Lia asked, crossing her arms and arching her eyebrows. "And what is that?"</p><p>Naota chuckled. "Go only where I go, and do <i>not </i>leave the trail." he said.</p><p>"How come?" asked Lia.</p><p>"Trap's." Naota said. "Claymores, poisons, tripwires, all sorts of things."</p><p>"Okay..." Lia said, blinking a couple of times. "Anything else?" she asked.</p><p>"yeah." Naota said with a nod. "Be as quiet as you can, cause otherwise you'll attract the patrols."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said with a nod. "Got it."</p><p>Naota acknowledged her with a quick bob of his head and stepped onto the trail. "Alright then, lets go."</p><p>After Lia had stepped onto the trail Naota eased the brush back into position and started running, flitting through the trees like a ghost, Lia right behind him.</p><p>"<i>How the hell does he </i>do <i>that?" </i>Lia thought as she dashed along. <i>"He's like a friggin' </i>ghost<i>!"</i></p><p>The path they ran was a meandering path through the woods that took them up and down hills and doubled back on itself several times. Coming around a bend Lia saw that there was a ravine with a log across it, but instead of crossing it Naota only went halfway before he jumped off.</p><p>Naota landed almost silently on a stone ledge seven feet below, Lia landing with an audible <i>'thump'</i> beside him. Glancing at Lia he got a nod from her and they were off again.</p><p>Moving with a liquid grace they leaped from ledge to ledge down to the bottom of the ravine, where there was a small stream. Hopping across several rocks they moved down the stream before crossing over to the other side and up the other side of the ravine.</p><p>What Lia had thought was a stand of pines in a shallow depression turned out to be the canopy of a forest and the shallow depression turned out to be the edge of a valley. As they dropped down onto the forest floor she saw that the trees were massive, towering several hundred feet into the air with their branches forming a living canopy.</p><p>With an easy grace they ran through the woods, leaping over logs and dodging around trees until Naota suddenly skidded to a stop.</p><p>"What is it?" Lia asked as she slid up beside him.</p><p>"Patrol." was Naotas answer. "Don't make any sudden moves and keep your hands where they can see them."</p><p>Lia nodded as she looked around at the forest surrounding them. "Okay." she said. "There's a couple of them in front of us." she added.</p><p>Naota nodded in acknowledgment. "Yeah, and there's four more behind us." he said quietly as Lia's eyes bugged out. "You're <i>supposed </i>to see the two in front."</p><p>"So how come <i>I </i>can't sense the ones that are behind us?" Lia asked. "I thought your clan didn't use chi."</p><p>Cardsharps would've killed for Naotas poker face. "I never said we <i>didn't</i>." he said as Lia got a miffed look on her face. "they're using concealment jutsus."</p><p>"Really." Lia huffed. "Are they going to just sit there or are they going to come out and show themselves?"</p><p>Six ninjas ghosted out of the trees around them in response to Lia's question.</p><p>"Welcome back Naota." one of the ninjas said as he stepped forwards. "I assume she is your wife." he asked, glancing at Lia.</p><p>"I should hope so." Lia answered, crossing her arms. "You spend four hours in a wedding ceremony, it should count for something."</p><p>Naota snickered as he turned to the ninja who spoke. "Yeah, she's my wife-"</p><p>"Good."</p><p>"-and we're here to spar with Tomoe and Ryusake" finished Naota.</p><p>"I know." the ninja said. "You two can go on in."</p><p>"Thanks." Naota said with a slight bow to the ninja. "C'mon Lia, let's go."</p><p>The ninjas ghosted back into the trees as Naota and Lia continued on their way, walking instead of running.</p><p>"Hey, Naota." Lia asked as they walked. "what was that all about?"</p><p>Ahead of her Naota shrugged. "They were just checking to see if I was Hagakure." he answered. "They're the last line of defense."</p><p>"Because we made it through the traps." Lia said.</p><p>"Yep." Naota answered with a nod.</p><p>Lia just shook her head. "Ninjas." she sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Class dismissed." said Akane as she bowed to her students.</p><p>"Thank you Sensei." the class chorused as they returned Akanes bow.</p><p>Akane watched as her students milled around gathering their gear before departing the dojo. Once the last student had left she grabbed a towel and headed into the house. Inside the living room Akane saw Evans sitting at the table with Ranma, Christian, and Mamimi discussing the finer points of boxing.</p><p>"Dojo's open." Akane said as she sat down at the table.</p><p>Evans nodded in acknowledgment as he continued talking. "-and so that's why foot work is key in boxing."</p><p>Pouring herself a glass of lemonade  Akane fixed Evans with a look. "Hey, Evans..." she asked, putting the picture down. "Where's your girlfriend?"</p><p>"School." Evans answered as he glanced at Akane. "She has a couple of tests."</p><p>Akane nodded as she sipped her lemonade. "Okay." she said.</p><p>Getting to her knees Mamimi got behind Christian and tapped him on the shoulder. "Chris -chan, could you change?" she asked.</p><p>"Sure, Mi -chan." answered Christian before touching his hand to the condensation on the side of his glass. "There you go." she said.</p><p>Ranma glanced at Akane, who nodded slightly. She had seen it too. As Mamimi took out the ribbon holding Christians ponytail she pulled a comb from her pocket and began to brush Chris -chan's hair. After getting it brushed Mamimi began to plait Chris -chan's hair into a French braid.</p><p>After finishing the braid she took Chris -chan's hair ribbon and tied off the end of of the braid with it, tying it into a bow.</p><p>"There you go." Mamimi said before she sat down next to Christian.</p><p>"Thank you." Christian answered. "Do you want your hair braided?" she asked.</p><p>Mamimi nodded as Chris -chan got to her knees and tapped her on the shoulder. Wordlessly Mamimi handed Chris -chan her hairbrush. Putting it on the floor beside them Chris -chan reached up underneath Mamie's hair and undid the knot holding her bandanna in place, disarming the magic on the bandanna.</p><p>Draping the bandanna over one shoulder Chris -chan brushed out Mamie's hair before braiding it halfway down her back. Holding the braid with one hand Chris -chan tugged the bandanna free and used it to tie off the braid, reactivating the magic.</p><p>"There you go Mi -chan." Chris -chan said, patting Mamimi on the shoulder.</p><p>"Thank you, Chris -chan." Mamimi said as Chris -chan sat down.</p><p>"Alright, you go ahead and get warmed up Evans." Ranma said as he stretched. "I got a couple of things that need taken care of."</p><p>Evans nodded before standing up. "'Kay." he said. "You two coming?" he asked, looking down at Chris -chan and Mamimi.</p><p>"Yep!" the two chorused, bounding to their feet in the blink of an eye and stampeding down the hall to the dojo.</p><p>'Well, if you'll excuse me..." Evans said, bowing to Akane and Ranma before heading to the dojo himself.</p><p>When Evans was gone Ranma sighed and looked at Akane. "So..." he began. "What was that?"</p><p>Akane sighed herself and looked at the table for a moment before shrugging. "I don't know Ranma." she said. "Maybe it's because of his curse, you know, like how it's affecting his growth?"</p><p>"Maybe..." Ranma said. "Or it could be because Mamimi asked him."</p><p>Akane nodded. "Could be..." she said. "But, I don't think Mamimi would ask him to do something that he would be uncomfortable with."</p><p>Ranma nodded before getting to his feet. "I'll have to ask Ono about it tomorrow." he sighed before heading to the dojo.</p><p>Inside the dojo Mamimi and Chris -chan were already in their dojo clothes of a pink gi (Mamimi) and a tang with kung fu pants (Christian) warming up as Evans come out of the changing room in his usual (sweatpants, no shirt).</p><p>Bowing to the sign at the front of the dojo Ranma approached his students.</p><p>"So..." he began. "What do we want to learn about today?" he asked.</p><p>"Footwork!" Chris -chan and Mamimi piped up.</p><p>"Okay..." Ranma said. "Evans, I believe this is your area?"</p><p>Evans nodded. "Alright." he sad with a nod. "The reason behind footwork can be summed up in a quote from Muhammad Ali: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." he quoted. "What does that tell you?"</p><p>Chris -chan raised her hand, getting a go ahead from Evans. "With footwork you can dance around your opponents attacks and hit him when he's not expect it?"</p><p>"Bingo!" Evans said with a nod. "So, do you have any idea on how to <i>do </i>it?" he asked.</p><p>The reply to Evans question was a couple of blank looks from the two of them. Turning to Ranma Evans nodded to the center of the dojo. "Looks like I'll have to show you. Ranma, would you care to be my assistant?"</p><p>"Sure." Ranma said with a nod.</p><p>Stepping to the center of thee dojo the two men went into their ready stances, Ranma in his usual modified crane, and Evans into his boxing stance.</p><p>"Okay you two, watch what I do." Evans said as he and Ranma faced off. "Ready Ranma?" he asked.</p><p>Getting a nod from Ranma Evans began to bounce on the balls of his feet. Ranma started the fray with a side kick to Evans torso that he just skipped out of the way to avoid. Jumping forwards Evans came in with a right jab, which turned out to be a feint leading into a three hit combo of left hook, right elbow, and left knee to the gut.</p><p>Dancing back Evans broke off the attack before Ranma could get a grapple going on him. Dancing around Evans circled around Ranma, always keeping moving.</p><p>"You see what I mean?" Evans asked, getting a couple of nods from Mamimi and Chris -chan. "Good." he said, giving Ranma the stop signal.</p><p>After bowing to each other Ranma and Evans turned to Mamimi and Chris -chan.</p><p>"Christian, do you think you can adapt what you saw to you and Mamie's styles?" Ranma asked, getting a nod from her.</p><p>"Yeah." Chris -chan answered. "It'll take some practice though."</p><p>"That's why we're in here." Ranma answered. "Why don't you two practice a bit and we'll see how you do?"</p><p>Chris -chan and Mamimi nodded as Ranma and Evans stepped back, allowing room for the two of them to spar. Once they had gotten into their ready stances Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Are you two ready?" he asked. Getting nods from the two of them he clapped his hands together once. "Begin!"</p><p>At the start signal Mamimi led off the fight with a punch that Chris -chan skipped out of the way to avoid and Mamimi transitioned into a low sweeper kick that Chris -chan jumped over.</p><p>Bouncing on the balls of his feet Chris -chan grinned as he and Mamimi faced off again -he had just figured out what Evans had been talking about, and was ready to put in action.</p><p>Skipping sideways to Mamie's left Chris -chan swung a mid -level side kick at her, expecting Mamimi to try and block it. Instead Mamimi <i>caught </i>it, then smacked the back of Chris -chans knee, collapsing her leg. Twisting her body Mamimi pulled Chris -chan off balance and onto the floor.</p><p>Going to the floor with Chris -chan, Mamimi then transitioned her attack into a full body hold. Chris -chan tried to break free, but Mamie's arms were like iron beams. After struggling for a few moments Chris -chan gave up and smacked the floor of the dojo three times with her foot.</p><p>Breaking the hold Mamimi released Chris -chan and they both rolled onto their feet facing Ranma and Evans.</p><p>"Okay, that was good." Ranma said as he looked at the two. "Now try it again, and this time Mamimi you try mixing it into your style."</p><p>"Yes sensei." Mamimi said as she bowed to Ranma.</p><p></p><p>Matoko hummed to herself as she pondered her writings, wondering in what way she was going to make the story flow before her train of thoughts was interrupted by the <i>clink</i> of metal on glass.</p><p>Glancing up she found Kenji looking back at her. They stared at each other for a couple of seconds before smiling at each other and looking away, a faint blush creeping up onto the both of their faces.</p><p>They both began to drift back into their respective little worlds when a knock at the door jolted Matoko back to reality. Putting down her pen she got up as another knock sounded at the door.</p><p>"I'm coming!" she called as she crossed the living room. Reaching the door Bre opened it and found Bre standing there. "Oh, Bre. Come in." she said as she stepped aside. "What brings you here?"</p><p>Bre shrugged as she stepped inside. "I'm just checking in on you two." she said. "Y' know, just making sure you two are okay, keeping fed, the usual."</p><p>"Oh." Matoko said with a nod.</p><p>"You two have been eating, right?" Bre asked as she headed for Kenji. Matoko nodded as Bre tapped Kenji on the shoulder to get his attention. "Hey Kenji, come up for air would ya?"</p><p>Kenji stopped what he was doing and looked up at Bre, blinking owlishly.</p><p>"Yeah?" he asked.</p><p>"Just making sure you're alive." Bre answered. "And speaking of staying alive, you and Matoko should keep the psychical side of your relationship secret for now."</p><p>"What! No!" Matoko sputtered as she and Kenji started turning beet red. "We didn't -we haven't-"</p><p>Holding up her hand Bre shook her finger at Matoko. "Uh -uh. I saw you two getting into it when I came over here yesterday." she said. "So, anyways, like I was saying, you two should try and keep it secret for now."</p><p>Glancing up at Bre Kenji decided to stand up. "S -so you don't have a problem with it?" he asked as he stood up.</p><p>"Nope." Bre said with a shake of her head. "It's a perfectly natural and healthy thing to do – and to be perfectly honest, it's about time you two got serious."</p><p>If they hadn't already been blushing before, Matoko and Kenji would have then.</p><p>"So when do you think we should tell my parents?" asked Matoko as she tried to keep her cheeks from burning and failing.</p><p>Bre shrugged. "Sometime after Kitten and Kitty get back from their honeymoon would be good." she said.</p><p></p><p>"Ah -choo!"</p><p>"Ah -choo!"</p><p></p><p>"We'll keep that in mind." Kenji answered.</p><p>"Good." Bre said. "And another thing- just in case you two go further, please be sure to have some protection, okay?" she asked as Matoko and Kenji blushed even deeper than they already had.</p><p>Her face on fire, Matoko nodded. "We- we will." she said in a small voice.</p><p>"Good." Bre said as she put her hands in her pockets and turned to the door. "I don't think Ranma and Akane are ready to become grandparents yet."</p><p>The floor became very interesting for Kenji and Matoko at that point.</p><p></p><p>"<i>I'm late! I'm late! I'm late! I'm late! I'm late!" </i></p><p>Zig -zagging through the forest Tomoe avoided the traps that littered the forest as she shrugged her vest on.</p><p>She had been late delivering a report and her teacher had given her a thorough chewing out, thus leaving Tomoe in her current situation of being twenty minutes late.</p><p>Ahead of her through the trees, Tomoe caught a glimpse of the training area that the Hagakure used and hoping that her cousin and his wife weren't there she put on an extra burst of speed. Leaping over a fallen log her danger sense went off a fraction of a second before Tomoe felt the tug of a tripwire on her ankle.</p><p>The explosion blew Tomoe out into the clearing, where she bounced twice and rolled to a stop. She lay there for several seconds waiting for the bells to quit ringing in her head.</p><p>"Okay, who changed the traps?" Tomoe groaned as she lifted her head and tried to look around.</p><p>"I did." Naota answered.</p><p>Tomoe's reaction was instantaneous, pushing herself over onto her back and kicking in the general direction of her cousins voice, only to have her leg caught and twisted into a hold before she knew what was happening.</p><p>"YEEEOW!" yelped Tomoe as Naota twisted her leg. "What'd you do that for?"</p><p>"To test you." was Naota's reply. "And frankly, I'm not impressed. You and your brother both missed the changed traps, and you were making enough noise to wake the dead, not to mention any possible guards."</p><p>"Bite me." Tomoe growled ass she twisted around to look at Naota. "You gonna let go of my leg or what?"</p><p>Naota's response was to twist her leg a little tighter. "No." he said. "There's a hole in how I'm holding you, and the only way for you to get loose is to exploit it."</p><p>Grimacing at the pain Tomoe tried to twist he body around to get a better view of her cousin. "Another test?" she hissed through gritted teeth.</p><p>Said cousin nodded as he kept her pinned. "Uh -huh. One that your brother passed."  he said, till flicking back and forth.. "And you can cut the melodrama. Ii ain't anywhere near hurting you."</p><p>Growling in irritation Tomoe watched as Naota's tail flicked into her peripheral vision, giving her an idea.</p><p>"<i>Thats it! That's the hole!</i>"</p><p>Tomoes hand flashed out out and caught Naota's tail, and then her leg was released. Releasing his tail Tomoe rolled over onto her feet.</p><p>"Okay, did I pass the test?" she asked.</p><p>Naota gave her a quick nod. "Yep." he said. "Now as soon as your brother gets back we can move onto the next set of tests."</p><p>Tomoe blinked and gave Naota a puzzled look. "More tests?" she asked. "And where <i>is </i>Yu -kun anyways?"</p><p>she asked, getting a shrug from Naota.</p><p>'Dunno. To kill time he and Lia decided to spar, and I haven't seen them- hold on." he said as his ears twitched. "I think they're done."</p><p>"Huh?" Tomoe asked. "What are you talking about?"</p><p>Glancing at his cousin Naota gave her a smirk. "You'll see in a second." he said, pointing up at the sky.</p><p>"Huh?" Tomoe asked as she looked up at the sky, totally confused.</p><p>"He should be here in four,... three,...two,...,one,...<i>now.</i>" Naota said as a black speck appeared in the sky.</p><p>"-!" Ryusake's voice faded up as he appeared.</p><p>'What the hell?" Tomoe asked. "How did he get up there?'</p><p>"That would be Lia." Naota said as he squinted up at Ryusake. "I don't see any scorch marks, so it wasn't a Pervert Smasher."</p><p>"Ehhhh?" Tomoe asked, giving Naota a confused look.</p><p>Tracking Ryusake's trajectory Naota did a quick guesstimate and didn't like the answer he came up with. "That's a chi attack Lia uses. She got it from her mother." he said as he grabbed Tomoes shoulders. "Look, lets move back a couple of meters, cause I think we're in the impact area."</p><p>Tomoe looked up again, saw her brother plummeting towards them, agreed with her cousin's assessment of the situation and jumped back out of the way.</p><p>Ryusake slammed into the ground, making a Ryusake shaped crater in the ground and raising a cloud of dust.</p><p>"Is he okay?" Tomoe asked as she peered through the clouds of dust. Hearing a groan she breathed a sigh of relief. "Oh, good, he's okay."</p><p>"More or less." Naota said as the dust began to clear. Striding over to Ryusake Naota leaned over him. "You okay kid?"</p><p>Nodding gingerly Ryusake grimaced. "I think so." he said.</p><p>Naota chuckled as he looked over his cousin. "What did Lia hit you with?" he asked.</p><p>"Dunno." Ryusake grunted as he started to sit up. "All I heard was 'Hyro Shouton -something', then she hit me with an uppercut, and then the next thing I know I'm airborne- whats so funny?" he asked as Naota's chuckle turned into a laugh.</p><p>"Were you using any jutsu's?" Naota asked, getting his laughter under control.</p><p>Ryusake grimaced as something in his back went 'crunch'. "Ow. Yeah. Fire jutsu." he answered, which sent Naota into peals of laughter. "Okay, what's so freaking funny?" he asked.</p><p>Shaking his head Naota offered his hand to his cousin to help him up. "You used chi based techniques against <i>Lia</i>." he snickered. "A chi <i>master</i>."</p><p>"Oh shut up." Ryusake grumbled as he took Naotas hand. "What'd she hit me with anyways?"</p><p>Naota grinned as he pulled his cousin to his feet. "The Hyro Shouten Ha." he answered. "It uses hot and cold chi to make a vortex. And since chakra contains chi, and fire jutsu's use a lot of chakra..."</p><p>Ryusake grimaced. "I was putting out a lot of hot chi." he said.</p><p>Naota nodded. "And I'm betting you felt a blast of cold with that uppercut, didn't you?" he asked as Ryusake dusted himself off.</p><p>Ryusake nodded. "Yeah." he said as he looked up at Naota. "How'd she do that, anyways? She didn't use any cold attacks prior to that."</p><p>"She can generate them at will." Naota answered. "She <i>is </i>a chi master, after all."</p><p>Ryusake growled in irritation as he rotated his arm. "So how does she do that hammer trick of hers?" he asked.</p><p>Naota shrugged in reply. "No idea." he said. "I think it's because her family is from Nerima. My sister can do the same thing." he added, rubbing his skull.</p><p>"Lovely.' Ryusake growled as a jonin faded out of the trees. "Heads up." he said, nodding his head in the direction of the jonin.</p><p>'Hmm?" Naota said as he looked up. "What's up?" he asked.</p><p>The jonin shrugged as he ambled over to where Naota and Ryusake stood. "Nothing. Just wanted to hear your opinion of them." he said, nodding at Ryusake and Tomoe.</p><p>Naota turned and looked the siblings over for a few moments before turning back to the jonin. "My opinion of them? They're chuunin." he said, getting a nod from the jonin.</p><p>Ryusake and Tomoe jaws dropped as their cousin and the jonin conversed.</p><p>"Okay.' the jonin said. "Both of you, back to the meeting house. You'll get your orders there."</p><p>The two siblings nodded shakily before disappeariing in puffs of smoke. After they had left Naota turned back to the jonin.</p><p>"They're getting fast -tracked?" he asked.</p><p>The jonin shrugged. "We need qualified genin and jonin here." he said. "Not in Tokyo."</p><p>Naota shrugged. "You'll have to talk to the school about that." he said.</p><p>The jonin nodded. "I know." he said. "But I'm not concerned about that."</p><p>"So what do you want to talk about?" he asked.</p><p>The jonin looked around and adjusted his mask. "The newest member of the Hagakure."</p><p>"Lia?" Naota asked, blinking in surprise. "What about her?"</p><p>"Nyaow?" Lia said as she stepped out of the Umi -Sen -Ken near them. "What's this about the newest member of the Hagakure?"she asked as Naota went rigid.</p><p>"Didn't you tell her?" the jonin asked Naota, smirking behind his mask.</p><p>"Tell me what?" Lia asked, looking at Naota out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>"Ahhh..." Naota began, trying to stall for time as he figured out a way to avoid Mallet -sama.</p><p>The jonin's smirk got bigger as he recognized the classic 'husband in trouble' routine, and decided to make it more interesting.</p><p>"Tell you that when you married him, you became a member of the Hagakure clan." he said, nearly giving Naota a heart attack.</p><p>"Naota..." Lia said in a sugary sweet tone "Is this true?"</p><p>Swallowing nervously Naota nodded. "Ahhh -y -yeah." he said.</p><p>"I see." Lia said with a nod. "Then, WHAT WAS ALL THAT WE WENT THROUGH FOR!" she shrieked, her battle aura flaring to life as she summoned her largest mallet ever to her hands.</p><p>"Woah, woah, woah,... Lia calm down." Naota said as he waved his hands. "Let me explain."</p><p>"So start explaining." growled Lia. "And it had better be good."</p><p>Taking a deep breath Naota began. "Okay." Naota said. "It's like this: There's the Hagakure <i>clan, </i>and then there's the Hagakure <i>school.</i>"</p><p>"And the difference?"</p><p>Naota sighed and looked up at Lia. "Well Lia, the difference is that the School is the really hardcore faction of the clan." he said. "They are loyal to the clan, but act independantly of the rest of the clan."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said, resting the head of her mallet on the ground. "Let me get this straight: All that stuff you did was to get free of the Hagakure <i>School, </i>not the <i>clan</i>, right?"</p><p>"Right." Naota said with a nod.</p><p>"But, any kids we have will still be ninja." Lia continued.</p><p>"No." Naota said with a shake of his head. "That's not true. Not everyone in the Hagakure is a ninja."</p><p>"So basically this is just part of me taking your last name, right?" Lia asked, her battle aura fading away. "It's just a part of being added onto the Sano family registry?"</p><p>Naota nodded. "Yep." he said.</p><p>"Okay." Lia said, her body language relaxing. "But I have a question: Why didn't you tell me this earlier?"</p><p>"Ahh..." Naota began. "Believe it or not, it never crossed my mind, what with dealing with the School and all."</p><p>Lia nodded, then lightly whacked Naota with the mallet. "Naota no baka!" she said as Naota rubbed his school. "Bad kitty! You should have told me!"</p><p>"Okay, okay!"  Naota said as he backed away from Lia's mallet. "I get the idea! Just knock it off with the malleting."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said before releasing the mallet back to Hammerspace. "But now I'm all dirty. I want to go back and get cleaned up."</p><p>"Me too." agreed Naota as looked down at himself. "I could use a scrubbing myself."</p><p>"And then I want to snuggle." added Lia.</p><p>"And I could go for that too." Naota agreed. "You wanna piggyback?" he asked.</p><p>"Sure." Lia said.</p><p>After picking up Lia and getting comfortable Naota bowed to the jonin and did his own 'disappearing in a cloud of smoke' trick.</p><p>Watching the smoke dissipate into the wind the jonin chuckled. "Newlyweds." he said to himself before disappearing himself.</p><p></p><p>The sun was hanging low on the horizon, slanting through the trees as the cicidias started their droning. Sitting on the porch of her family's shrine Chikako Akamatsu was enjoying her afternoon cup of tea.</p><p>Picking up the latest issue of Icha Icha Paradise she thumbed to where she marked her place and started to read. Chikako had only read a couple of paragraphs when the cicadas just cut off as if a switch had been flipped.</p><p>"<i>That's odd..."</i> she thought. She had just put the book down when Chikako felt a buzz in the back of her mind. <i>"And that s odder still."</i></p><p>Deciding that this warranted a look around the temple grounds, Chikako got to her feet and retrieved her sandals. Starting with the temple itself she found nothing out of place on the outside, but when she slid the door open she saw that the paper wards swaying back and forth -but the air was dead calm.</p><p>Frowning she slid the door shut and continued to check out the grounds. As she continued to check Chikako noticed that <i>everything </i>had gone quiet, birds, insects, dogs, but she didn't feel anything <i>evil</i> in the air. Just the buzz in the back of her brain, and the complete and utter silence of everything in the area were the only things out of place.</p><p>As she came around to the rear the grounds Chikako heard voices. Stopping, she zeroed in on them and started walking towards them. As she approached the voices got louder and she could start to make out what they were saying.</p><p>"- my head."</p><p>"Are you sure you don't know whats wrong?"</p><p>"No I don't."</p><p>Stepping around a bush Chikako saw a teen aged couple under a tree, the girl leaning over the boy who had his head in his hands. As she approached she was surprised to see that the boy had gold tattoos running up his arms and the both of them had cats ears.</p><p>Clearing her throat, Chikako made herself known to the couple. "Excuse me, but may I help you -eek!" was all that she was able to say before the boy had a gun drawn on her.</p><p>Grimacing in pain the boy looked up at her and -<i>relaxed</i>?</p><p>"Miss Akamatsu?" he asked.</p><p>Chikako blinked as she got a better look at the boys face, and it caused a light to go off in her head. Leaning closer she got a better look and confirmed her suspicions.</p><p>"Hey... you're Kamone Sano's son, aren't you?" she asked.</p><p>Flipping the safety on Naota dropped his pistol into his lap and nodded. "Yeah." he grunted. "I'm Naota."</p><p>Nodding, Chikako gave him a once over, comparing how he looked now to when she last saw him. "You've grown." she said. "And you've... changed."</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said with a nod. "It's a long story."</p><p>'Ah.' Chikako said as she looked up at Lia. "And who's your friend?" she asked/</p><p>"Oh." Naota said, reaching up to grab Lia's hand. "This is Lia, my wife."</p><p>That made Chikako stand up straight and take a long look at the girl. "Wife?" she asked. "Aren't you two a little young for that? Even with that stupid contract?"</p><p>Lia rolled her eyes in annoyance. "Personally, I blame our idiot grandfathers for that." she said. "And does everyone in this place know about it?"</p><p>"Pretty much, yes." Chikako said with a nod as she looked back at Naota. "And are you okay?" she asked him.</p><p>"Except for a massive headache, I'm fine." said Naota as he rubbed one of his temples. "I forgot about the anti demon wards around this place."</p><p>Chikako blinked as she digested Naotas comment. "Wait." she said. "You mean you're a..."</p><p>'Demon." finished Naota. "Yes I am. And right now I want to go home and take a nap, so I'll answer any questions you have tomorrow."</p><p>Chikako nodded as Lia helped Naota to his feet. "I'll give you a call tomorrow." she said. "You're staying at your family's house, right?"</p><p>"Y-yeah." answered Naota.</p><p>"Okay." Chikako said. "Talk to you tomorrow."</p><p>Naota nodded as he and Lia started to head off, Naota leaning on Lia.</p><p></p><p>End</p><p>(1) Thats a Tokyo Police Department Cataclysm Division mecha.</p>
