</div>Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Two.<p>Chapter Five.<p>Lia yawned as she padded downstairs for a midnight snack. As she entered the kitchen and flipped on the light she scratched the back of her head. Opening the fridge she peered inside and sighed. The week before it had been her twelfth birthday and there had loads of goodies from Kasumi and Nodoka to snack on.<p>Unfortunately in a house with three full blooded Saotomes they hadn't lasted long. Taking some rice and a bottle of water she sat down at the table and dug in. As she ate her thoughts turned to how different her life was now from when she arrived.<p>When she arrived in Nerima Lia had never even been to school, had no friends, and Japanese was something she spoke at home with her parents. Now she was studying for her high school placement tests, counted Matoko, Genda, and Izu as her closest friends, and now she spoke Japanese like a native.<p>"And I got a little brother too..." she added mentally.<p>Lia had discovered being a big sister could be a lot of fun, especially since she was helping with the Neko -ken training. Thor had told Ranma in his own way he was too old to train another student, so Lia had taken over that duty.<p>And Matoko had started to show an interest in the medical arts field, so she and Lia were helping out after school at the clinic. At the thought of her friend Lias mouth quirked into a smile. Ever since they had met Matoko had come out of her shell, revealing a very sweet and gentle soul under the timid exterior.<p>The ringing of the phone tore Lia away from her thoughts. As she got up Lia smiled.<p>"Speak of the devil..." she thought.<p>Matoko, knowing Lias sleep habits sometimes called at about this time so they could have some 'girl time' with out any distractions. Grabbing the phone Lia pressed the 'talk' button and sat down.<p>"Hello." Lia said into the phone. Her smile faded as she listened to her friend on the other end. "Matoko, slow down, I can't understand you."<p>"L-Lia it's, it's, it's,..." Matokos voice stuttered out of the phone.<p>"It's what Matoko?" Lia asked, concern filling her voice.<p>"Its my mom, She's in the tubandnowshewontwakeuuuup!" Matoko gushed out before lapsing in wailing. "Oh no..." Lia thought as her heart leapt into her throat. "Matoko, stay with me I'm gonna go get Dad" she said to her friend as she jumped to her feet.<p>Taking the steps in three quick leaps Lia dashed her way upstairs to her parents room. Kicking open the door she flipped on the lights.<p>"Dad, Matoko needs help" she yelled as she bounded into the room.<p>"YAAA! WHAT IS IT?"Ranma yelled as woke.<p>"It's Matoko, she needs help" Lia shouted, panic creeping into her voice.<p>"What are you are you talking about Lia? Whats wrong?" Ranma asked as he sat up in bed.<p>"I don't know! All I got was her mom's in the tub and wont wake up!" Lia said as the panic in her voice grew.<p>"Oh no..." Ranma said as he threw the covers back. "Akane, call Kasumi and have Ono meet me at Matokos apartment." he said as he hurried to the dresser.<p>"Okay." Akane said as she got up.<p>After throwing on some clothes Ranma walked over to his daughter who was kneeling on the floor cradling the phone. Kneeling down he shook Lias shoulder to get her attention.<p>"Lia, keep Matoko on the phone, Ok? I'm heading over there now and Ono should be there soon." he said.<p>After Lia nodded Ranma headed downstairs and out the door. After getting his bearings he stepped out into the street and jumped onto the nearest roof. Then he tore off in the direction of the Tanaka apartment, using every bit of speed he could beg, borrow, or steal.<p>Ono paced in front of the apartment building and wondered where Ranma was. He had been awakened several minutes earlier by Kasumi and had been told there was an emergency involving Matoko Tanakas mother. And in his haste to leave he had forgotten to ask for her apartment number.<p>"And I had forget the damned cell phone too..." Ono cursed mentally. "Ranma, you had better get here soon." he added.<p>Onos plea was soon rewarded as Ranma landed next to Ono with his usual cat -like grace.<p>"Ranma, thank goodness you're here, I was beginning to panic."Ono said as he turned to him. "I forgot to ask for Matokos apartment number." he added.<p>"Follow me." Ranma said with a nod. Ono followed him as they bounded up five flights of stairs and then ran down to the far end. He leaned against the wall for support as he was somewhat out of breath.<p>"Kasumis right, I am getting out of shape." he said as Ranma began to pound on the door.<p>"Matoko, open up! It's Ranma!" Ranma said as he pounded on the door.<p>Ranma pounded until he heard the deadbolt open. Stepping aside he made room for Ono as Matoko opened the door. Neither man was prepared for the sight that greeted them.<p>Instead of the calm and collected girl that they knew the girl that met them was a wreck. Matoko was clad only in her nightgown and her normally well brushed hair was a tangled mess. Her eyes were wide with terror and her cheeks were wet with tears.<p>Shaking off his surprise Ranma spoke first.<p>"Matoko, where's your mother?" he asked.<p>"!" Matoko wailed as she grabbed Ranmas arm and pulled him into the apartment.<p>Matoko led them to the bathroom, where through the open door they could see a figure lying in the bathtub. Motioning Ranma to stay with Matoko Ono entered the bathroom.<p>Once inside the bathroom Ono knelt by the tub and checked Matokos mother for a pulse. Sighing with relief Ono checked for what could be the cause of her condition. Noting the tub was empty and she was fully clothed he ruled out a bathing accident.<p>Checking further he found a empty pill bottle in her lap and a empty bottle of sake lying on the floor next to the tub. Checking the label on the pill bottle he found it had contained prescription painkillers.<p>Ono sighed as realized how he was going to have to report this: attempted suicide.<p>"Damn." he muttered as he got up. Turning to the door he looked at Ranma. "I'm going to need a phone." he said.<p>"Here." Ranma said as he dug into his pocket and produced a cell phone. "It's our business phone." he said as he tossed it to Ono.<p>Ono took the phone and dialed emergency services. Shutting the door he cut Ranma and Matoko off from what he was saying. Matoko tried to break away to the bathroom but Ranma held her tight.<p>"It's okay Matoko." he said to her. "She'll be okay." he said.<p>Seeing that she was still holding on to the phone and hearing Lias frantic voice on the other end he held the phone up to her ear.<p>"Matoko, talk to Lia." he said. "Talk to Lia." he insisted as he pressed the phone to her ear.<p>"L-L-Lia?" Matoko asked weakly.<p>Hearing Lias voice calmed Matoko down and Ranma holding her helped as well. As he held her Ranma looked around at the apartment and realized with a start just how small it was. It barely enough for one person and yet two people had been living there for years.<p>The walls were cracked and the carpet was threadbare. The table had been stood up on end against the wall to make room for a lumpy futon with old blankets. There wasn't even a proper kitchen in the apartment, just a counter and a refrigerator.<p>There were no pictures on the walls because there were floor to ceiling shelves with boxes of clothing and other household items. On the ceiling were two fluorescent lamps providing lighting.<p>"This isn't a home, this is a cell." Ranma thought.<p>Holding her tighter Ranma knew why she had never said anything on how desperate her home situation was: pride. He had grown up in a situation like hers and knew exactly what it was like to be dirt poor, of never having what others took for granted.<p>"Matoko, I will make sure you survive this." Ranma swore as the sounds of the paramedics arriving came in through the open door. "No one should have to experience what you have." he thought as they entered.<p>After checking her vitals the paramedics loaded Matokos mother onto a stretcher board and hustled her out the door. Ono gave a report to the police about what happened. After giving them contact information it was decided the Saotomes would look after Matoko.<p>Deciding they would come over for her clothes and personal effects in the morning Ranma draped his shirt over Matoko and carried her piggyback all the way home.<p>They were met at the door by Lia and Akane.<p>"Matoko!" Lia cried as she clamped onto her friend with a bear hug. "Are you okay?" she asked as she helped Matoko through the door.<p>Matoko wordlessly nodded as Lia helped her to the table. As they sat down Lia remained at Matokos side.<p>"Can I get you something? Is there anything I can do?" Lia asked her.<p>Ono gently cleared his throat. "Lia, what I think Matoko needs now is rest. She's been through a lot of trauma today and she needs time to recover." he said gently. "I think she should be put to bed. I'll do it and you can-"he continued but was interupted by Lia.<p>"No!" she said. "I'll do it." Lia added, steel in her voice.<p>Helping Matoko to her feet Lia began to guide her to the stairs. Ono followed behind them as they walked to the stairs.<p>"I'm just want to make sure Matoko is okay." he said as Lia looked back to him.<p>"Okay." Lia said with a nod.<p>"Good!" Ono said as he clapped the girls on the shoulder. "Now lets get Matoko to bed, she's had a long day." he said as they started up the stairs.<p>Ranma chuckled as the trio disappeared up the stairs. Akane gave him a funny look.<p>"Whats so funny?" she asked.<p>"You remember that night right after we first met, when my legs gave out?" Ranma asked.<p>Akane nodded slowly as she recalled the memory. "Yeah." she said with a nod.<p>Ranma gave her a tired smile as he jerked a thumb in the direction of the stairs. "I think Ono just pulled something like that on the girls." he said.<p>"Huh?" Akane asked.<p>Ranma tapped his left shoulder. "Ono clapped them each on the left shoulder." he said.<p>"Oh." Akane said. Rubbing her eyes she shook her head. "Gods, I'm tired." she said.<p>Ranma nodded his head in agreement. "Same here Akane. What a night." he said.<p>Akane sighed as she looked at the clock. "So, what happened?" she asked as she looked back at Ranma.<p>Ranma shook his head and shrugged. "I don't know Akane." he said. "I just don't know." he repeated.<p>"What do you mean you don't know?" Akane asked.<p>Ranma looked at the table. "I was taking care of Matoko. All I saw was her mother in the tub." he said.<p>"You didn't see anything?" Akane asked.<p>"No." Ranma answered.<p>"I know what happened."<p>Ranma and Akane looked up at Onos voice.<p>"Oh?" Akane asked as he sat down.<p>Ono sighed and looked at his hands for a few moments before looking up at them. "Matokos mother attempted suicide." he said.<p>"Suicide?" Akane exclaimed. "Why?" she asked.<p>Ranma pinched his nose and sighed. "I got a look at their apartment Akane." he said. "I think they were barely making ends meet." he continued.<p>"What makes you think that?" Akane asked.<p>Ranma looked up at the stairs. "Akane, their apartment was barely larger than our guestroom." he said. "It was like a prison cell." he added.<p>"Why didn't she say anything?" Akane asked.<p>"Pride." Ranma answered.<p>"Ah." Akane said. "How is Matoko?" she asked as she looked at Ono.<p>"Asleep, with Lia holding on to her." he said. "The gods help whoever would try to take Matoko from Lia now." he said with a chuckle.<p>Ranma and Akane both smiled at Onos comment.<p>"Lias can be quite protective." Akane said.<p>"She's turning from a kitten into a tigress." Ranma added.<p>The three of them smiled at that and then they turned serious.<p>'So what's going to happen to Matoko ?"Akane asked.<p>Ono frowned. "I don't know Akane." he said. "But one things for sure. Matoko wont heading home anytime soon." he added. "So what do we do?" Akane asked.<p>Ranma put his hand down on the table with a slap. "We help her." he said. "But what were going to do can wait until tomorrow after we've had some sleep." he said, looking at the clock.<p>"Goodness, it's four am." Ono said as he looked at the clock. "You're right. It can wait." he said as he got up.<p>After seeing him to the door Ranma and Akane trudged upstairs to their room, but not before they had checked on the girls. When they peeked in they saw Lia and Matoko lying on Lias futon, Matoko in a deep and thankfully dreamless sleep with Lia curled protectively around her.<p>Content that the girls were okay the two of them went to bed.<p>Lia awoke late in the day, in the afternoon around one. Opening her eyes she found herself looking at Matoko. Lia wondered for a moment why Matoko was there until the events of the previous evening came crashing back.<p>Getting up onto her elbow Lia checked on her friend and discovered she was asleep.<p>"Hey." Lia said as she shook Matokos shoulder gently. "Wake up."<p>"Mama!" Matoko cried as she suddenly sat upright, startling Lia.<p>"Yaaah!" Lia said as she fell backwards in surprise.<p>Matoko looked around frantically for a few seconds before she realized where she was and flopped backwards onto the futon. Lia levered herself up into a sitting position as tears began to form in Matokos eyes.<p>"It wasn't a dream..." she said.<p>Lia hung her head. "I wish it was Matoko. I wish it was." she said.<p>"I know." Matoko said with a sniffle. "I know."<p>Lia glanced up at the clock and blinked when she saw the time. "Holy cow, it's one fifteen." she said. "I think it's time we got out of bed." Lia said as she got to her feet.<p>"Okay." Matoko said as she sat back up.<p>Ranma looked up from her magazine as the two girls came downstairs. "Hello." she said as they sta down at the table.<p>"Hello Daddy." Lia answered while Matoko just nodded.<p>"You girls hungry?" Ranma asked as she got up from the table.<p>"I am." Lia said.<p>"A little." Matoko added quietly.<p>"Okay. There's leftovers. Is that okay?" Ranma asked them.<p>After getting nods from both girls Ranma went into the kitchen and returned a few minutes later with a tray of food and a fresh pot of tea. Putting the platter in front of them she poured them each a cup of tea and then sat back down.<p>"Dig in." she said.<p>Ranma poured herself a fresh cup and drank it while the two girls ate. After they were finished Ranma put down her teacup and cleared her throat.<p>"Matoko," she began "I was going to head over to your apartment to get you some clothes. Is there anything else I can get you while I'm there?" she asked.<p>Matoko nodded slightly. "Yes. My book bag and Chuu -chan, my teddy bear." she said. "And my diary." she added.<p>"Where is it?" Ranma asked.<p>Matoko blushed slightly. "My underwear box." she said.<p>Ranma nodded. "Okay." she said. Getting to her feet Ranma turned to Lia. "Lia, Kasumi is watching Christian today. She'll be bringing him back around six. I should be back by then but if I'm not you'll have to watch him, okay?" she said.<p>Lia nodded. "Yeah." she said. "Matoko and I can keep an eye on him." she said, hugging her friend.<p>"Okay. I'll be back as soon as I can." Ranma said as she turned to go.<p>After Ranma had left the two girls sat and drank their tea in silence.<p>"You okay Matoko?" Lia asked.<p>Matoko nodded. "I'm surviving." she said. "My stomach hurts though." she added.<p>"Can I get you something?" Lia asked.<p>Matoko shook her head. "No, it's just stress." she said. "But the food helped though." she added.<p>Lia nodded. "That's good." she said. "You know what else I've found helps?" she asked.<p>"What?" Matoko asked.<p>"A good soak in the furo after a good scrub." Lia answered with a smile. "And in case you haven't noticed we're a little aromatic." she added.<p>"Oh." Matoko said. "You're right." she added with a sniff.<p>Lia proved to be correct, much to her surprise. As she sat in the hot water she felt the tension in her body ease. Unfortunately it did nothing to ease the storm of emotions in her mind however. Feeling she needed a release Matoko lifted her head to look at Lia.<p>"Lia..." she began.<p>"Yeah Matoko?" Lia asked.<p>"Do you know what happened to my mother last night?"<p>Lia opened her eyes and looked at Matoko. "She slipped in the tub, right?" she asked.<p>Matoko shook her head. "No, she, she,.." Matoko stuttered before regaining her composure "She tried to commit suicide last night." she continued.<p>Lia lifted her head up and sat up in the furo. "What? Why?" she asked.<p>Matoko swallowed before continuing. "Let me explain." she began.<p>Matoko then told Lia everything about her home life down to the last detail. Lia sat and listened to her friends story in shock. While she listened Lia realized just how strong and proud her friend really was.<p>"Matoko, I never knew." Lia thought. "But no matter what I'll get you through this. Me and everybody else." she added.<p>When Matoko finished she lay back in the tub and closed her eyes, the storm in her mind ebbing.<p>"And that's why." she said with a sigh.<p>Lia was silent for several moments before speaking. "I never knew." she said.<p>"It's not something I like to talk about." Matoko said.<p>"Obviously." Lia said as she sat back. The two of them sat there and enjoyed the rest of their soak in silence. As the two of them were toweling off afterwards Matoko turned to Lia and gave her a small smile.<p>"You were right Lia. That soak helped." she said.<p>Lia returned Matokos smile. "Told ya." she said.<p>The two girls ended up spending the week at home, Ranma and Akane having decided that the girls needed time to recover before they faced the daily challenges of school. During that week Lia never left Matokos side, nor afterwards when they returned to school.<p>Over the next two months the Saotomes tracked down Matokos relatives, who refused to have anything to with her because she was half -Caucasian. Seeing as how they had been having no luck with the family route Ranma decided it was time for something drastic.<p>One day while the girls were at school the adults of the Tendo, Saotome, Kuno, and Tofu families gathered at the dojo for a roundtable meeting.<p>Clearing his throat Ranma got everyone's attention. "Okay. Everyone knows why were here." he began. "Matoko Tanaka. Her relatives won't take her in, which means she's going to end up in an orphanage."<p>Ranma let that sink in before continuing.<p>"And I refuse to let that happen to her." he said, smacking his hand on the table.<p>"So what are you going to do?" Kasumi asked.<p>Ranma smiled as he laid his hand on Akanes shoulder. "Akane and I are going to adopt her." he said. "And to do that we'll need your help." he said.<p>"And what exactly do you need us to do?" Ono asked.<p>"Leave it to me." Tatewaki interupted.<p>"What can you do?" Ranma asked.<p>"A lot of giri is owed my family by people in government." Tatewaki explained. "All I need to do is make a few phone calls." he continued.<p>"Huh?"Ranma asked.<p>Tatewakis mouth quirked into a smile. "Ranma, my extended family is quite sane and rational, with the notable exception of my father who was born a complete and utter moron." he said. "That's why he's principal of Furinkan. They put him where he could do the least damage." he added.<p>"I always wondered how he became principal." Akane said<p>"It's a good place for him."Tatewaki said with a nod. "And when I return home I shall call my family and we'll call in a few favors" he said.<p>"Favors?" Ranma asked. "From who?"<p>Tatewaki put on a neutral expression. "You'd be surprised Ranma. You'd be surprised." he said.<p>Ranma was surprised actually. Within a few weeks of the meeting he got a visit from Nabiki before the start of the days classes. With her Nabiki had a manila envelope.<p>"Congratulations Ranma." she said, handing the envelope to him "It's a girl."<p>"Already?" Ranma asked as he took the envelope. "How did he do it?" he asked as he opened the envelope.<p>Nabiki smiled. "Trust me Ranma, you don't want to know." she said. "I thought I was devious. Boy was I wrong." she added.<p>"Oh?" Ranma asked., lifting an eyebrow. "How so?"<p>"I asked him where he learned his tricks. He said, and I quote, 'It's a skill perfected by my family during the Tokugowa era.' unquote." Nabiki answered. "And speaking of my husband, I left him and Chisu home alone to fend for themselves." she added.<p>Ranma chuckled. "Yeah. You had better get back while you still have a house." he said.<p>Nabiki laughed. "See you Ranma." she said as she showed herself out.<p>After Nabiki was gone Ranma hefted the envelope and smiled as he thought about the contents. Then he put it on a shelf for when the girls got home.<p>It was after dinner when Ranma decided to spring the surprise on them. They had given Christian his bath and put him to bed when Ranma headed upstairs with a tray of snacks.<p>"Knock knock. Anybody hungry?" he asked as he opened the door to Lias room.<p>"I am!" Lia called as she looked up from he homework.<p>"Me too Mr. Saotome." Matoko added.<p>Ranma tsk-tsked as he set the tray down next to the girls. "You can't call me that anymore Matoko." he said.<p>"Why not?" she asked, a note of worry in her voice.<p>"Because you're now a Saotome." Ranma said as he produced the certificate of adoption.<p>"What?" Matoko asked as Ranma handed her the certificate. "This certificate states that Tanaka Matoko is now the child of Saotome Ranma and Saotome Akane." she read aloud, not comprehending.<p>Lia however, had. "Eee! Matoko, you're my sister!" she squealed as she latched onto Matoko with a Tendo Bear Hug (tm).<p>"AAaaack!" Matoko said as the breath was squeezed out of her. "I can't breathe!" she wheezed.<p>"Sorry." Lia said as she released her sister.<p>"Wh-wh-why?" Matoko asked, holding up the paper.<p>Ranma smiled. "Because we're you're family Matoko. We have been from the get go." he said. He pointed to the certificate. "That just makes it official." he said.<p>Matokos hands shook as she held the certificate in her hands. Ranmas words echoing in her brain and reeling from the shock Matoko decided to pass out.<p>"Matoko!" Lia cried as her sister toppled over.<p>"Well" Ranma said as Lia fussed over Matoko "she took that well."<p>End.<p>By clawing him.<p>Giri: a debt of honor.
