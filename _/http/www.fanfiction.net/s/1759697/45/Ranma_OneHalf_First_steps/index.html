</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First Steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter Two.</p><p>Ranma hummed a tune that he'd heard Naota playing the other day as he casually loped along the top of a fence. He was on his way to Onos clinic, responding to a note Christian had brought home when he had returned from the clinic.</p><p>Hopping down from the wall he was on Ranma crossed the street and casually jumped onto the wall across the street. He followed the wall down to the next intersection and made a left, continuing on towards Onos clinic.</p><p>Ranma was halfway down the street when the local archer fish dealer pedaled by with a load of goods.</p><p>"Sorry Mr Saotomeཀ" he called as he pedaled away.</p><p>Ranma waved an okay back to the man as she continued on unperturbed by what had happened. After raising three kids a gender -changing water based curse was mild.</p><p>"<i>I wonder what Ono wants to talk about?" </i>Ranma thought to herself as she landed on the street in front of the clinic. <i>"I hope it isn't serious." </i></p><p>The bell on the door tinkled as Ranma stepped into the reception area of the clinic.</p><p>'Oh, hello Uncle." Genda said as he stood up from the desk. 'Or should that be 'Aunt?" he asked as he eyed Ranmas condition.</p><p>"Hey Genda." Ranma said as she closed the door behind her. "What brings you back to Nerima?"</p><p>Genda shrugged as he saw back down. "Some high school English teacher was being chased by an old PS2 accesory and caused major structural damage in the buildings my classes were in."</p><p>'Again?"</p><p>"Yep." Genda sad as he went back to his laptop. "But its not all bad. I had a test coming up that I hadn't studied for. Now I can be prepared for it."</p><p>'Thats the spirit." Ranma said. "By the way, is your father in?"</p><p>"He's in the back." Genda said, pointing.</p><p>"Thanks." Ranma said as she went to the back.</p><p>"Anytime."</p><p>"Ono?" Ranma asked as she knocked on the hallway wall. "It's Ranma."</p><p>"I'm in here." Onos voice came from his minuscule office.</p><p>"You sent a note home with Christian saying you'd like to see me?" Ranma asked as she leaned against the door frame.</p><p>"Ah, yes." Ono said as he sat up from behind his desk. "You remember what we talked about when Christian first picked up his curse?"</p><p>"Yeah." Ranma said with a nod. "I remember."</p><p>"Well..." Ono said as he flipped open a folder. " I think what we talked about is starting to come to pass."</p><p>"Your kidding." Ranma said as she stepped into the office and sat down.</p><p>"I'm not, I assure you Ranma." Ono said as he looked at the contents of the folder. "Christians shorter and lighter than average."</p><p>"By how much?" asked Ranma.</p><p>"By a centimeter and a couple of kilos." Ono answered. "It may be that its just a delayed growth spurt, so I wouldn't be getting worried."</p><p>"Easy for you to say." Ranma answered. "What about when Christians in cursed form?"</p><p>"Perfect health." Ono answered. "Nothing out of the ordinary."</p><p>"I sense a 'but' in there." Ranma said.</p><p>Ono nodded as he flipped a page. "The 'but' is I only have a very limited amount data to refer to." he said. "I was thinking you could have Christian come in on a regular basis so I can track his growth and so on."</p><p>Ranma nodded stretched. "What about Mamimi? Hows she doing?"</p><p>"Physically, very well. She is in excellent shape and and has a quite bit of strength." Ono said. "Mentally however..."</p><p>"Theres a problem?" Ranma asked.</p><p>'Not now." Ono answered. "But they are going to be entering puberty in a few years Ranma, and as close as they are..."</p><p>"Ah..." Ranma said with a wince. "That will be a problem."</p><p>"indeed." Ono said.</p><p>"Well, thanks for telling me." Ranma said as she got up.</p><p>'You're welcome." Ono replied.</p><p>"See you on Sunday." Ranma said as she walked out.</p><p>'See you then." Ono replied.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where Bre is?" Naota wondered.</p><p>"Bres gone?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said with a nod. "So is the scooter."</p><p>"She said she was going to take it for a spin." Kenji said as he looked over his shoulder. "I would have told you earlier, but I was playing Quake..."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said with a shrug.</p><p>They were walking home, having done the weeks shopping with Lia and Matoko along to help with the shopping. Now they were looking forwards to the prospect of Matokos cooking.</p><p>"You two and Quake." Lia said as she shook her head.</p><p>"What can I say, we're addicted." Naota answered.</p><p>'Tell me about it." Lia answered back. "And you think my love of Pocky is bad."</p><p>"Well it is." Naota said.</p><p>"I know." Lia said. "And I do admit, it's- whats that noise?"</p><p>"Its coming from behind us." Naota said as he turned around.</p><p>Off in the distance a cloud of dust could be seen rapidly approaching them.</p><p>'What do you think it is?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"Can you see it Naota?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Hold on..." Naota said as he squinted.</p><p>The dust cloud snapped into focus, revealing the cause of the dust cloud to be a yellow Vesper.</p><p>'Well?" Lia asked.</p><p>"It's Bre." Naota answered. "On the scooter."</p><p>"A scooters causing all of <i>that?" </i>Lia asked, pointing to the dust cloud.</p><p>"Yep." Naota said. "And here she comesཀ"</p><p>Everyone scrambled out of the way as Bre thundered past. There was a screech as she braked and hung a left into the alley next to the print shop, popping a wheelie as she entered.</p><p>That was followed a heartbeat later by a loud crash.</p><p>Naota blinked as a tire rolled out of the alley and across the street.</p><p>"And there she went." Lia said as she glanced at Naota. "You think Bres okay?"</p><p>'She should be." Naota said as he started walking forwards. "Shes a Sano."</p><p>Stepping into the alley Naota saw Bre and the scooter tangled up in a junk pile that Hideo had put there.</p><p>"Bre, you okay?" Naota asked as he walked down the alley.</p><p>"Little red button..." was Bres response, followed by maniac giggling.</p><p>'I'll take that as a 'yes'." Naota said as he walked up to Bre. "Hey Kenji, could you get the door? I'm gonna be bringing Bre in."</p><p>"Sure." Kenji said as he began to go up the steps.</p><p>Putting his bags down Naota moved the junk aside and untangled the scooter and his sister. Casually slinging Bre over his shoulder Naota picked up his bags and went up the stairs to the apartment.</p><p>Inside Lia and Matoko were putting away the groceries while Kenji was booting up his computer.</p><p>"Is she okay?" Lia asked as Naota came in.</p><p>"Yeah." answered Naota with a nod. "She apparently pressed the 'little red button', whatever that is."</p><p>"Button goodཀ" Bre said with a giggle.</p><p>"So don't worry?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Yep." Naota said as he plopped Bre onto a beanbag.</p><p>Putting the bags on the floor next to the others Naota grabbed the remote and turned on the TV. Flipping through channels he settled on a sports channel and went back to help Lia and Matoko.</p><p>When the TV came on it snapped Bre out of her trance. Blinking, she shook her head and pulled her goggles down around her neck.</p><p>"Wooo... now <i>that </i>was a wild ride.' she said as she sat up.</p><p>'Welcome back to the land of the living." Naota said as he put a box of noodles in the cupboard.</p><p>"Thanks." Bre said as she looked around. "You been grocery shopping?"</p><p>"Yeah." answered Naota. "Just picking up some essentials."</p><p>"Oh, okay." Bre said as she got up. "I'll take over. Go play some Quake." she said as she stepped up next to Naota.</p><p>"Kay." Naota said, tossing a can to Bre.</p><p>She waited until Naota had sat down and was focused on booting up his comp before leaning over and nudging Lia.</p><p>"So... how did the 'accessories' work?" she whispered conspiratorially.</p><p>"They worked." Lia said as she turned pink around the edges.</p><p>'How well?" Bre asked as she passed a box of sauce mix to Lia. Seeing her turn crimson Bre smiled as she got her answer. "That well, huh?"</p><p>"Yes." Lia squeaked.</p><p>"So whens the wedding?" Bre teased.</p><p>"They were thinking in the spring, after graduation." Matoko answered.</p><p>'Matokoཀ"</p><p>"It's okay, shes Naotas sister." Matoko said.</p><p>"What?" Bre asked. "You're joking, right?"</p><p>"Sorry. Force of habit." Lia said to Matoko. "Nope." she said to Bre.</p><p>Bre blinked for a couple of times, then her face split into a huge grin.</p><p>"You mean...my little brother... is getting... <i>married?" </i>she asked. Getting a nod from Lia and Matoko Bres smile got brighter. "You know what that means?" she asked.</p><p>"what?" Lia asked.</p><p>"That means we get to <i>PARTY</i>ཀ" Bre said as she punched the air.</p><p>"See? <i>Thats </i>why I wanted to be the one who told her- SON OF A <i>BITCH</i>ཀ" Naota said before he got fragged.</p><p>"I hate to tell you this Naota..." Kenji said as he worked his joystick "But I 0wnzed you."</p><p>"In your dreams." Naota said as he respawned. "I'm gonna- what the?"</p><p>"We got a camper..." Kenji said as a slight grin came across his features. 'And he's a n00b. Time to 0wnz3d h1m."</p><p>Lia, Matoko, and Bre watched as the two boys went to work on the noob. Blinking she leaned over to Matoko.</p><p>"Is it me, or is that just plain disturbing?" she asked.</p><p>'It's not you." Matoko answered.</p><p>"Uh -huh." Bre said as she glanced at her watch. "And I have an appointment, so I'll be going."</p><p>"An appointment? Wit who?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Evans." answered Bre.</p><p>Unnoticed by everyone Naotas tail twitched at Bres mention of Evans.</p><p>"Have fun." Lia said as Matoko headed to the door.</p><p>"I will." said Bre as she stepped out the door.</p><p></p><p>Hours later Naota had grown tired of being '0wnz3d' by Kenji and had logged off the server to play with his guitar chords while Lia used him as a convenient source of heat and a pillow.</p><p>Matoko busied herself in the 'kitchen'(1) making lunch while Kenji, having only only n00bs to play with was drawing.</p><p>Finished with lay out and cleanup Kenji picked up his finishing pencil(2) and put the point to paper, only to have the lead slide up to the nib.</p><p>Rapid clicking on the advance button told Kenji he was empty and had to refill. While he searched for a container of fresh lead he found a spiral -bound notebook under some sketches of his.</p><p>"<i>Must be Matokos." </i>Kenji thought as continued his search. <i>"Better put it aside so she can find it. Now, where is that lead?" </i></p><p>Hearing a sudden energetic chord Kenji glanced up at Naota, who was scribbling the chord down prior to his working it into a full song while Lia snuggled closer to Naota.</p><p>"<i>I can;t believe he's getting married." </i>Kenji thought as he located the container he was looking for.</p><p>Pulling the eraser out of the end Kenji flipped open the lid on the lead container and shook out a few pieces. Carefully he slid them into the barrel of the pencil before working the advance button to get one into the feeder mechanism.</p><p>Closing the lead container Kenji reinserted the eraser back into the pencil and went back to his drawing. A <i>clang</i> of a pot on the stove made Kenji glance up at Matoko as she bustled about.</p><p>" <i>I wonder if I'll ever get married?" </i>Kenji thought as he went back to his art. <i>"And to who?Matoko?" </i></p><p>Kenji quickly shook that thought off as he began to sharpen his lines.</p><p>"<i>Nah. She'd never go for me." </i>he thought. <i>"I'm too much of a freak. At least Naotas found someone he's happy with." </i></p><p>Kenji shot a quick sideways glance at his 'brother', as Kenji thought of him as he built on his chords.</p><p>"<i>And the kami knows hes earned the right." </i>he thought. <i>"Now that hes broken his family free of the Hagakure School he can at least lead a semi normal life." </i></p><p>Concentrating on his work Kenjis brow knotted slightly as he drew.</p><p>"<i>But it's not like I have had a normal life myself." </i>he thought. <i>"I didn't exactly have what you'd call a </i>'loving relationship' <i>with my parents." </i></p><p>Overdoing a line Kenji ground his molars and reached for his knead able eraser and began to knead it.</p><p>"<i>Not that I really know what a normal relationship is like to begin with." </i>Kenji added sourly. <i>"Takatas married to a gold digger, and my parents... well, my mother doesn't give a damn about me and my father-" </i></p><p>Kenji paused as he felt a phantom pain travel up his right arm.</p><p>"<i>Theres no secret in how he feels about me." </i>Kenji thought as a shadow fell across his drafting table.</p><p>He looked up to see Matoko standing over him.</p><p>"Is everything all right?" she asked.</p><p>Kenji nodded s he smiled up at her.</p><p>'Everything fine Matoko." he said. "Thank you for asking."</p><p>"You're welcome." Matoko said before turning back to the kitchen.</p><p>Kenji watched Matoko out of the corner of his eye as she resumed her cooking.</p><p>"<i>I wonder if..." </i>he thought. <i>"No. Never. Not me.</i>"</p><p>Sighing Kenji returned to his work.</p><p>"<i>Not possible. We're friends."</i></p><p>"<i>Nothing more." </i></p><p></p><p>"And so then she disappears on me, and the next thing I know I'm flat on my back with an ten year old on top of me." Evans said. <i>"Purring." </i></p><p>Bre and Evans both laughed at his retelling of how Lia learned the Umi -Sen -Ken. As the laughter died down Bre looked up at Evans.</p><p>"You're like an uncle to her." Bre said.</p><p>"Yeah." Evans said with a nod. "I've sorta been her link to home."</p><p>"She's homesick?" Bre asked. "I thought she liked it here."</p><p>"Oh she does, don't get me wrong." Evans said. "But every now and then she just needs to drop her Japanese accent and talk to someone in English."</p><p>"I know how she feels." Bre said. "I've only been here a short while and I'm homesick."</p><p>"Bre, I've been here ten years and I get homesick." Evans said.</p><p>Bre nodded as she looked around at their surroundings. "So..." she said "Where to now?"</p><p>"I don't know.' Evans said with a shrug. "But I don't know about you, but all this talk about home has gotten me in the mood for a burger."</p><p>"Well, fat chance of finding any around here that aren't charcoal briquettes." Bre said.</p><p>"Oh I know a place that has authentic burgers." Evans said. "Not that far from here."</p><p>"Really?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Evans said with a nod.</p><p>'Lets go then." said Bre.</p><p>"Follow me." Evans said as he turned a corner.</p><p>"So how come there is a American style burger joint here in Japan?" asked Bre as she walked with Evans.</p><p>"An ex -GI started it years ago." explained Evans. "He married a local and set up shop."</p><p>"Oh." Bre said with a nod. "How come I've never heard of him before?"</p><p>"Well, his shop is something of a secret among the GI s." said Evans. "Only those who have been stationed here a while know about it."</p><p>"Really." said Bre as she gave Evans a long look.</p><p>"Really." Evans answered.</p><p>"Well, it had better be good." Bre said.</p><p>'Oh, don't worry, it is." said Evans.</p><p>The inside of the diner was decorated simply, with tables and chairs that you could find in any diner across Japan. The walls were a beige and the floor was tiled.</p><p>What really stood out was the fact the diners patrons were American servicemen and women, with all branches represented. A couple looked up and waved when Evans and Bre entered.</p><p>"Yo, Evans, who's your date?" a Navy man asked.</p><p>"This is Bre." answered Evans.</p><p>"And who's this?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Bre, meet Chief Petty Officer Trevor Hayes." Evans said.</p><p>"Hi." Bre said as she extended her hand.</p><p>"Call me Trevor." he said as he shook Bres hand.</p><p>"Trevor represents the squids at the inter service poker game." Evans said as he pointed to some empty seats. "You mind?"</p><p>"Not at all." Trevor said as Evans and Bre sat down. "Though I still haven't forgiven you for bringing that JSDF spook in."</p><p>"Oh, you're just sore cause he cleaned you out." Evans said as he waved to the woman working the counter. "Hey Kimmie, my usual and a menu for Bre."</p><p>"He was a ringer and you know it." Trevor huffed.</p><p>"Excuse me, but theres a regular poker game?" Bre asked. "What kind?"</p><p>"Texas Hold 'em." Evans answered.</p><p>"Can I join in?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Depends. Are you a world class poker player?" Trevor asked.</p><p>"No." answered Bre. "I'm good, but not <i>that </i>good."</p><p>'You can join then.' Trevor said.</p><p>"Sourpuss." Evans said out of the side of his mouth.</p><p>"Now my grandfather Dokuohtei, <i>he's someone</i> you be afraid of." said Bre as a waitress came over with a tray with a pair of plates on it and a menu.</p><p>"Heres your orders guys." the waitress said as she set the plates down. "And your menu." she added.</p><p>"Thanks Hiroe." Trevor said as she placed his plate in front of him. 'Well, we hold the game every week, so feel free to join in."</p><p>"Oh, I will." Bre said.</p><p></p><p>The sound twin purrs filled the air as Kenji placed his artwork in the scanner. Lia and Naota were asleep after having stuffed themselves with Matokos cooking, curled up next to the heater vent.</p><p>Looking over at them Kenji shook his head and clicked the start icon. As the scanner worked Kenji stretched and listened to the vertebrae in his back pop.</p><p>When the scanner finished Kenji pulled the sheet of artwork out and put it in the done pile. He had imported the image into Photoshop and had converted it when Kenji felt a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"Kenji?" she asked. "Do you want to go for a walk?"</p><p>Kenji blinked as he looked up at Matoko. Realizing that he had been sitting in front of his computer for the past few hours he decided that it really <i>was </i>a good time for a break.</p><p>"Sure." he said as he got up.</p><p>They had been walking for thirty minutes before Matoko spoke.</p><p>"Kenji." she said.</p><p>"Yeah?" he asked.</p><p>"Lia and Naota make a cute couple, don't they?" Matoko asked.</p><p>Kenji chuckled and nodded. "That they do." he said. "It didn't look like that at first though."</p><p>"True." Matoko said. "But she warmed up to him."</p><p>'Thats a miracle in of itself." Kenji pointed out.</p><p>Matoko nodded and they walked in silence for a few more minutes. That was how their conversations went: a few sentences exchanged between each other followed lengthy periods of silence and contemplation.</p><p>"We could use them as reference for a romance." Kenji said. "A romantic comedy."</p><p>"Or a martial arts story." Matoko said.</p><p>They both chuckled at that and then mused on it for a while as they walked in a continuous circle.</p><p>They were walking along a canal for the third time when Matoko spoke again.</p><p>"I think I know what we could be the basis for." Matoko said.</p><p>"Oh? What is that?" Kenji asked.</p><p>"A romantic tragedy." answered Matoko.</p><p>'What?" Kenji asked as he stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>"Think about it." Matoko said as she stopped and looked over her shoulder at Kenji. "The tragic story of the heroine as she tries to get the man of her attentions to notice her."</p><p>"What- you- what're you talking about?" Kenji gibbered as he looked at Matoko with a confused expression.</p><p>"She goes to incredible lengths to get him to notice her, only to have them fail." said Matoko as she turned around and began to walk towards Kenji. "I don't know how it ends though. Thats as far as I got in the plot. Could you help me with the ending?"</p><p>Kenji gaped at her as she approached him. "You- you- you-" he stammered. "me?" he asked, pointing to himself.</p><p>"Yes." Matoko said as she stepped within arms reach of him. "Is that so strange?"</p><p>"But- But- But why me?" asked Kenji. "Whats so great about me? I'm a freakཀ"</p><p>"Why are you a freak?' Matoko asked.</p><p>"Be- because I'm tall, and bony, and I don't know how speak right..." Kenji said. "I mean, look at meཀ What would a girl like you want with a guy like me?"</p><p>"Well, to begin you're on the same level as me height wise." Matoko began. "And looking beyond the superficial theres a lot more to you than meets the eye."</p><p>"Like what?" Kenji asked.</p><p>"Like that incredibly creative imagination of yours." Matoko said. "Or how about you're actually very talented."</p><p>'huh?" Kenji asked.</p><p>"Kenji, you've mastered at <i>least </i>three or four different mediums for your artwork, and multiple styles." Matoko said. "That doesn't happen every day."</p><p>"But-" Kenji began but Matoko cut him off.</p><p>"And you're a good person." Matoko said. "You've been through some tough situations and still stayed true. Not many people can do that."</p><p>Matoko stepped backwards and looked Kenji in the eye.</p><p>"I've told you how I feel Kenji." she said. "So how do you feel?"</p><p>Kenji blinked as he tried to formulate an answer, but nothing came to him. Several long seconds dragged by before he finally was able to say something.</p><p>'I- I- D- don't know." stammered Kenji.</p><p>Matokos answer thoroughly surprised Kenji.</p><p>'Okay." she said with a nod. "When you know what your feelings are, let me know."</p><p>Kenji nodded dumbly.</p><p>"Okay." Matoko said. "See you tomorrow?"</p><p>Kenji nodded again as Matoko turned and walked away. He stood there until she was out of sight and then collapsed to his knees.</p><p>"Shit." he squeaked.</p><p></p><p>Lia yawned as she walked down the hall, having just woken up a few minutes earlier. Scratching the back of her neck Lia padded down the hall to the stairs, intending on looking for some breakfast.</p><p>Downstairs Lia found her parents at the table eating breakfast, along with her sister.</p><p>'Someones up early." Lia commented as she sat down next to Matoko.</p><p>'Actually, I haven't been to bed yet." answered Matoko.</p><p>"Your muse hit you again?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Something like that." said Matoko.</p><p>'Oh? What did you come with?" Lia asked.</p><p>"A lot." Matoko answered."I'll tell you about it after you get back."</p><p>"Huh- Oh, yeah, that." Lia said.</p><p>Glancing up at the clock Ranma blinked as he realized what time it was.</p><p>"Yeah. Eat up Lia. We gotta get going soon." he said.</p><p>"Okayཀ" Lia said as she grabbed a bowl.</p><p>After Lia and Ranma had left it left Matoko and Akane at the table. There was silence until Akane had finished eating and had put away her chopsticks.</p><p>"So, what was it exactly that kept you up last night/" Akane asked.</p><p>Matoko sighed and put her chopsticks down as she looked up at Akane.</p><p>"I was thinking about something I said to Kenji." answered Matoko. "I'm afraid I may have said the wrong thing."</p><p>"What did you say?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I told how I felt about him." Matoko said. "And then I asked him how he felt me."</p><p>"I see." Akane said. "And what did he say?"</p><p>"That he didn't know." Matoko groaned as she laid her head on the table.</p><p>Akane chuckled as she poured herself some more tea.</p><p>'Thats Kenji alright." she said as Matoko covered her head with her hands. "What was his body language?"</p><p>"He looked like he was going to either run away or faint." Matoko answered. "Did I do the wrong thing?"</p><p>"No." Akane answered. "I don't think you did."</p><p>"So why did he act that way?"</p><p>"Offhand, I'd say it's because he's a social recluse." Akane answered. "But thats just my observation from what I admit is limited contact with him. Your best bet is to go to the person who knows him best."</p><p>"Naota?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"Bingo." Akane said. "He and Kenji are brothers in all but name. If anyone would know whats going on with Kenji, it'll be Naota."</p><p>"Okay." Matoko said as she sat up. "I'll call him."</p><p>"No you're not." Akane said as she pointed to the stairs. "First you're going to bed and getting some sleep young lady."</p><p>'Yes Ma'am." Matoko said as she got up.</p><p></p><p>The rustle of paper woke Naota as he dozed on his futon. Keeping his eyes closed Naota listened to the sound of movement in the other room. Besides paper being moved he heard quick breathing and a rapid machine -gun heartbeat.</p><p>The paper being moved told him it was Kenji being Kenji and drawing. The rapid heartbeat, combined with the sudden gurgle of his stomach told Naota that it was also likely that Kenji was on a caffeine bender.</p><p>Those were never good, and tended to end rather badly. The one time Naota had let one go unchecked Kenji ended up with a scar on his left wrist.</p><p>Ono had seen the scar while tending to Kenjis broken wrist and had begun to voice concerns about Kenji being suicidal, but Naota had intervened and told Ono that it was from a paper cutting accident.</p><p>Which it was. What he hadn't said was that when it had happened Kenji had been up for almost four days straight on a caffeine bender and his parents had been showing their usual level love for their youngest son.</p><p>And that when Kenji had accidentally cut his wrist he had thought <i>'they don't care about me so why should I' </i>and had just let himself bleed. If it hadn't been for Takata dropping in unexpectedly Kenji would have bled out.</p><p>"<i>Better get up and see whats got Kenji hopped up on caffeine." </i>thought Naota as he opened his eyes and sat up. <i>"Hopefully its just his muse." </i></p><p>Getting up Naota found Kenji at his drafting table, a large mug of what smelled like the sludge that Kenji called tea nearby and a pencil in his hand.</p><p>"Morning Kenji." Naota said as he walked over to him.</p><p>"Hey." grunted Kenji.</p><p>"Whats up?" Naota asked as he picked up Kenjis mug.</p><p>"Not much- Heyཀ" Kenji said as he saw Naota take his mug. "Thats mineཀ"</p><p>"I think you've had enough." Naota said as he sat down. "Tell me, have you slept yet?"</p><p>"No." Kenji answered as he went back to his drawing.</p><p>'Put down the pencil." Naota added. "And tell me whats wrong."</p><p>Kenji sighed and slumped his shoulders as he turned around to face Naota.</p><p>"Well?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Matokosaidshelikesme." Kenji mumbled.</p><p>It took Naota moment to translate what Kenji had said before he responded.</p><p>"Of course she does." he said. "Shes your friend."</p><p>Kenji shook his head as he looked at the tatami.</p><p>"No, like you and Lia like each other." Kenji said.</p><p>Naota sighed and sat back on his elbows as he looked at Kenji. "I was wondering when she would get tired of trying to get you to notice her." he said.</p><p>"You knew?" Kenji asked as he looked up at Naota.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said with a nod.</p><p>'Why didn't you tell me?" Kenji asked.</p><p>"Two reasons: One; I had my hands full with Lia and the School, and two; I figured if I told you it would have killed you." answered Naota.</p><p>"Oh." Kenji said as he looked back at the floor. "I nearly did die when she told me."</p><p>'What did she say?" asked Naota.</p><p>"That she liked me because I was creative and talented, and I was a good person.' Kenji answered.</p><p>'Which you are." Naota pointed out. "And believe it or not, there are people out there besides me and the guys who like you for what you are Kenji."</p><p>"She asked me how I felt about her and I told her I don't know. She said when I do figure out how I feel about her to tell her." Kenji asked. "So what do I do Naota?"</p><p>"Well, first you get some breakfast in you." Naota said as he sat up. "And then you get some sleep, and then you figure out how to tell her that you actually <i>do </i>like her in that way."</p><p>'But-ཀ" Kenji began as Naota held up his hand.</p><p>'No buts. Eat first, then sleep."</p><p></p><p>Matoko was lying bed half asleep when she heard her door open.</p><p>'Matoko? You awake?" Lia asked.</p><p>'Yes." Matoko answered. "How was your appointment?"</p><p>"It was okay." Lia said. "Just a rehash of what we had in Phys Ed classes."</p><p>'Oh." Matoko said as she felt the bed shift as Lia sat down. "Nothing new then." she said as she scooted over.</p><p>"Well there is the one thing." Lia said as she lay down on the bed. "I'm now officially on the pill."</p><p>"You are? Why?" Matoko asked as she rolled over.</p><p>"Dad explained it to me when we were going over to the clinic." Lia said. "He an Mom don't want me to have any 'accidents' that'll screw up my chances at college."</p><p>"Oh." Matoko said as Lia got settled.</p><p>"So what did you come up with last night?" asked Lia.</p><p>"Not much." Matoko answered. "I told Kenji how I feel about him last night."</p><p>Lia was silent for several seconds before she responded.</p><p>"What did he say?" she asked.</p><p>"He said he didn't know." Matoko answered "I talked to Akane about it, and she suggested that I talk to Naota for some answers."</p><p>"Thats what I would have said." Lia said as Matoko hugged her close. "But how do <i>you</i> feel?"</p><p>"I'm worried." Matoko said. "I'm worried that I may have did the wrong thing, that it'll scare him away."</p><p>"You told Kenji how you feel Matoko." Lia said as she hugged her sisters arm and adjusted herself so she could get comfortable. "Theres nothing wrong with that."</p><p>Matoko sighed as she hugged Lia. "I know. But I am going to talk to Naota though-"</p><p>"Thats a good idea." Lia said.</p><p>"-After my nap." finished Matoko.</p><p>Lia nodded as she curled into a semi -fetal position and began purring.</p><p></p><p>The music of Slipknot at low volume mixed with the thrumming of the presses in the shop below as Naota sat at the table. Before him lay a field stripped AK -74(3), with a AK-47 and a M-16 A-2(4) lying next to him. He was running a patch through the bore when his cell began to vibrate and dance around on the table.</p><p>Putting down the rifle he picked up the phone and checked the display, which read 'Lia'.</p><p>"Yo." he said.</p><p>'Naota?"</p><p>"Hey Matoko." Naota said as he grabbed his ear bud. "Gimme a second to plug in."</p><p>"Okay." Matoko answered.</p><p>Putting the bud in his ear Naota plugged the other end into the phone.</p><p>'I'm back." he said as he put the phone down. "And I can imagine why you're calling."</p><p>There was silence on the other end of the phone for a few moments before Matoko spoke.</p><p>"Kenji told you?" she asked.</p><p>'Yeah." Naota said with a nod as he picked the rifle back up.</p><p>'H-how is he?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"Right now he's sleeping after coming down from a caffeine bender, but other than that he's fine." answered Naota.</p><p>'He's...not ... he's not..." Matoko stammered.</p><p>"No, he's not going to run away." Naota said with a chuckle. "You just turned his world on end."</p><p>"I figured that." Matoko said. "<i>I </i>turned my world on end."</p><p>Naota actually laughed at that one as he pushed another patch through the bore of his rifle, then made a face as he saw what the patch looked like.</p><p>"Yuck." he said.</p><p>"What?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"Oh, I'm looking at the crud one of my toys picked up." Naota answered.</p><p>"Do I even want to know?" asked Matoko.</p><p>"Since this is an open line, no." Naota answered.</p><p>'Okay..." Matoko said. "Anyways, back to Kenji."</p><p>"Back to Kenji." repeated Naota. "Like I said, you turned his world on end."</p><p>"But I <i>did </i>do the right thing, right?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota answered. "You did. It'll just take him a while to accept the fact he <i>really </i>does like you."</p><p>"He does?" Matoko asked.</p><p>'Yeah." Naota said. "I mean, it shows in his artwork. You should take a look at his sketchbook sometime."</p><p>"His artwork? How so?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"Just idle sketches, stuff like that." Naota said. "He uses you for a  lighting studies and stuff like that."</p><p>"Oh." Matoko said. "I thought it was because we worked together..."</p><p>"And I thought Lia and I were clueless." Naota said</p><p>'Ouch." Matoko said. "Are we that bad?"</p><p>'Yes." Naota said.</p><p>Matoko groaned and Naota heard the 'thump' as she flopped backwards. Naota chuckled as he looked down the muzzle of the barrel to check the bore.</p><p>"Matoko, let me give you a piece of advice. Just give Kenji some time." he said. " This is a whole new situation for him and it's gonna take him a while to get used to it."</p><p>"Okay." Matoko said. "So I should be prepared to wait awhile."</p><p>"Yeah." answered Naota. "But this is like producing a manga Matoko. It takes time and a lot of collaboration."</p><p>Matoko chuckled and Naota could hear the smile in her voice.</p><p>'Thanks Naota." she said. "It helped."</p><p>'Anytime." Naota answered. "Kenjis my brother. We gotta look out for each other."</p><p>"I'll talk to you later." Matoko said.</p><p>'Bye." Naota said before he disconnected.</p><p>Pulling the ear bud out he looked over at Kenjis bedroom, where snoring could be heard.</p><p>"Now all I gotta do is knock some sense into that head of yours Kenji.' he said with a sigh.</p><p>End.</p><p></p><p>(1) Thats the term Naota dignified the patch of linoleum with the appliances where they prepared food.</p><p>As an artist I cant help but add my two cents here: Kenji uses two types of mechanical pencils in his art: A .07mm loaded with HB, and a .05mm loaded with 2B. The .07mm is for laying out a picture and is wielded with a very light hand.</p><p>The .05mm is used to finish the pic and used with a heavier hand.</p><p>(3) No, that is not a typo. The AK-74 is the current assault rifle in use by the Russian armed forces. It differs from the AK-47 in that its chambered for the 5.45 x 39mm round instead of the 7.62 x 39mm, has a sheet metal receiver, it's stock and for end are made out of laminated wood or black plastic, and it's magazines are made out of  plastic rather than sheet metal.</p><p>(4) Yes, Naota has a rifle for all occasions.</p>
