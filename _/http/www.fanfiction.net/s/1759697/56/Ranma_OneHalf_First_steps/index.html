</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First Steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter 12.</p><p>Shrugging on her sleep shirt with a  yawn, Chikako stepped out of her bedroom  too check and make sure that the house was buttoned up before she  went to bed. Checking the front door Chikako noticed that the wind  had started to pick up.</p><p>"<i>Odd..."</i>  she thought, then shrugged and continued  on.</p><p>The rest of her  check was completed in quick order and then she turned out the light  and went to bed. Snuggling under the covers Chikako got comfortable  and listened to the wind blowing outside. Soon her eyelids grew heavy  and she drifted off to sleep.</p><p>In the shrine the  charms and wards swayed slightly as the trees creaked and groaned  outside as the wind began to pick up even more. Suddenly one of the  wards near the alter began to crinkle up as if by an invisible hand  before bursting into blue flames.</p><p>One by one the  wards surrounding the alter burst into flames, then the rope they  were hanging from snapped and flashed into flames as it fell to the  floor. Soon nothing was left of the wards but ash.</p><p>For a few moments  there was nothing but the wind, then there was the scrape of wood on  wood and the ashes swirled as a shadow flowed out from the alter.</p><p></p><p><i>Clink!</i></p><p>Chikako stirred and  muttered something about the wind as she  rolled over. Snuggling up under the covers she started to drift back  off to sleep when her her eyes flew open.</p><p>"<i>Waitaminute -</i>clink?<i>"</i></p><p>Getting up on Lonee  elbow Chikako rubbed her eyes and listened.</p><p>For a few moments  there was nothing but the usual nighttime sounds, as the wind had had  died down. Then there was the faintest creak of wood from somewhere  within the house, and then Chikako knew what had woke her up: A  burglar, albeit a suicidal one to be  burgling a house in a ninja village.</p><p>Throwing the covers  back she got up and padded over to her  closet and slid the door open. Reaching inside Chikako quietly  rummaged inside for a suitable weapon, and came up with two baseball  bats. One was an Louisville Slugger, the other was a regular run -of  -the -mill aluminum bat.</p><p>Deciding the  Slugger was for special occasions, Chikako put it away and headed to  the bedroom door. Sliding it open she  peeked out down the hall and saw the coast was clear. Easing out of  the bedroom she very carefully minded the nightingale floors(1) and  snuck down the hall.</p><p>Coming to the  living room Chikako peeked out around the corner and <i>very  </i>carefully did a check of the room before she stepped into it.</p><p>Half way into the  room there was a slight rustle and a creak behind her. Whirling  around Chikako swung her bat at the noise, only nothing was there and  she ended up hitting the wall.</p><p>Swearing under her  breath Chikako fought to get her heart rate down as she stared at the  hole in her wall. Making a mental note to call her cousin Eisaku  in the morning in the morning to patch it, Chikako turned around to  resume her search.</p><p>'Hi there."</p><p>Chikako shrieked  as stumbled backwards from the shadowy figure in front of her. As the  figure began to step towards her she regained her footing and brought  the bat up in front of her like a sword.</p><p>The figure stopped  and let out a low laugh. "Oooh, we know some kendo. I <i>like </i>that  in a miko."</p><p>Chikako paused for  a second as what the figure had said percolated through her brain.  Hefting the bat, Chikako lunged forwards and swung at the figure who  just simply sidestepped it. With a bang and <i>crunch </i>of plaster  the head of the bat buried itself into the wall as the figure stepped  behind her.</p><p>"And I  <i>love </i> what they're doing with kimono's these days." said the  figure as he stepped in close.</p><p>The next  thing Chikako knew there was a hand clamped on her butt and five  claws were poking her.</p><p>Letting  out a scream of rage that would do an  Amazon proud, Chikako whirled around and swung her bat at the  intruders head- or, at least where she thought it would be. The  figure leaned backwards and let the bat pass overhead, putting a  third hole into Chikako's wall.</p><p>Pulling  the bat free Chikako tried again and this time the intruder hopped  backwards. That infuriated Chikako to no end, so she hefted her bat  and lunged at him again with another scream.</p><p>And  <i>again </i>he dodged her attack and this time it was a lamp that  got hit, instead of the wall. Chikako tried again, and it was the  floor. She did this three more times, hitting the couch, coffee  table, and finally the TV.</p><p>The  intruder whistled as he glanced at the imploded remains of the TV.  "Wow. That looked expensive." he said as turned his gaze back to  her. "Better keep practicing."</p><p>Chikako's  left eye ticked and then she had an idea.</p><p>"Okay  smart ass, dodge this." she growled.</p><p>Then she  yanked her shirt up.</p><p>The  intruder was starting to say something when she did that, but all  that came out was an unintelligible mumble  that was cut short by the crack of Chikako's bat connecting with his  skull. With a scream of pain the intruder stumbled backwards as she  reared back for another swing.</p><p>"THAT  WASN'T FAIR- YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!" the intruder screamed  before Chikako cracked him in the ribs with her bat.</p><p>Now  clutching his ribs with hone hand and his head with the other, the  intruder continued to stumble around  looking for an exit while trying not to get clobbered by Chikako.  After a couple more solid thumps from Chikako he got lucky and  tripped over a power cord, sending him headlong into a screen and out  onto the porch.</p><p>Screaming  in rage at the added damage to her house Chikako charged him, bat  held high- only to hit the door jamb  overhead.</p><p>Seeing  his chance to escape, the intruder  scrambled to his feet and ran as fast as he could. As he scrambled  away Chikako could have sworn that she saw that he had <i>tails.  </i>Lowering the bat Chikako sighed and walked back inside to clean  up the mess.</p><p></p><p>Akahito  Kawashima sighed as he wandered down a footpath away from the temple.  The first girl he runs into after being unsealed,  and she tries to bash his head in.</p><p>Reaching  up, he felt his head and found the lump on his skull was almost gone,  and by the feel of it any damage to his ribs was almost healed as  well.</p><p>"Of  course I had to go for the shrine maiden." Akahito grumbled as he  came to a road.</p><p>And  stopped. The road was nothing like he had ever seen before in his  life -it was smooth for one, not cobbled. Ad it was lit by lamps. Or  what he thought were lamps anyways. As he approached one he saw that  it was high up on a pole, attached to a stone post.</p><p>With a  shake of his tails, Akahito easily jumped up onto the beam and walked  over to the lamp. On closer inspection he saw this was no ordinary  lamp, for it contained no wick or candle, just a glowing ball of  light. Shaking his head Akahito jumped down and continued down the  road.</p><p>Ten  minutes after he got into the town proper he was throughly lost.  Nothing was the way he remembered. The building were completely  changed, their architecture was completely  unlike what he was used to.</p><p>After  about half an hour of wandering Akahito found himself on top of a  hill looking out over the town.</p><p>"Just  how long have I been sealed?" he asked himself.</p><p></p><p>Dumping  the last dustpan of plaster and TV fragments into the trash Chikako  sighed and dropped the lid back onto the trashcan. Clipping the  dustpan to the broom she put both back into the cupboard and then  went to the sink to wash her hands.</p><p>Turning  on the water she just happened to look up and see the back of the  shrine through the kitchen window and remembered that she hadn't  checked the shrine. With another sigh Chikako turned the water off  and went to her bedroom to put some shorts on before she went  outside.</p><p>A couple  of minutes later she was at the shrine, flashlight in hand. Coming  around to the front of the shrine Chikako saw that the door had been  slid open, which meant that her recent visitor had been there.  Stepping out of her sandals Chikako went into the shrine itself.</p><p>Running  the beam of her flashlight over the interior she noticed that none of  the decorations seemed to have been damaged or destroyed. She did  notice that the wards in front of the shrine seemed to have been  taken, but that appeared to be it.</p><p>Wondering  why the hell someone would take the wards Chikako advanced further  into the shrine and stopped when she felt something with the bare  soles of her feet. Looking down she shined her flashlight at the  floor and saw that there was ashes all over the floor, and in the  ashes sandal prints leading from the alter.</p><p>Deciding  that this warranted further examination  Chikako headed to the alter. There she discovered  that a previously hidden panel had been slid back.</p><p>"<i>Now who would break  into a shrine?" </i>Chikako  thought to herself. <i>"The only thing rumored to have been  there was- Chikako, you </i>idiot.<i>"</i></p><p>Smacking  herself on the head Chikako the realized that her intruder hadn't  been breaking <i>into </i>the shrine, he had been breaking <i>out </i>of  it. Shaking her head at not realizing it earlier, Chikako headed to  where the scrolls were kept to check on them.</p><p>"<i>I guess I </i>did  <i>see some fox tails."</i>  she thought as she reached the storage space.</p><p>Opening  it up Chikako saw that the scrolls were untouched. Sighing in relief,  Chikako put her flashlight on a shelf and started to collect the  scrolls.</p><p>"<i>Might as well get  these things to more secure place.</i>"  she thought as she gathered up an armful. <i>"The legend  said he was here for these things in the first place when he was  sealed, and it's only a matter of time before he remembers."</i></p><p></p><p>Akahito  was relieved. After wandering for over an  hour he had finally found a building he sort of recognized as an inn.  He had found it after spotting a horseless, covered, metal cart going  down the road.</p><p>Getting  onto the roof of an adjacent building Akahito watched as boxes were  unloaded from the cart into the inn. Why someone would make a  delivery to an inn in the middle of the night, he didn't know. But  then again, ever since he had been unsealed very little had made  sense.</p><p>Since  the occupants roof  the building were busy unloading Akahito decided that this would be a  good time to sneak into the building and see if he couldn't get a  better handle on the current situation.</p><p>Slipping  around to the alley alongside the inn wasn't much of a problem for  him, nor was scaling the wall and jumping up to the second story.  Sneaking along he found an window that opened up from what he  remembered as a hallway. Slipping a claw into it he slid it open  enough for him to enter and slipped inside.</p><p>And ran  straight into a kunoichi.</p><p></p><p>Naota  snapped awake at Tomoe's outraged shriek.  Getting up, SOCOM in hand, Naota went to the door and stuck his head  outside. Hearing what sounded like a major fight going on inside the  main house Naota slipped outside and went into the main house.</p><p>Downstairs  he ran into Ikuko, who was wielding  a cast iron skillet.</p><p>"What's  going on?" he asked.</p><p>Ikuko  pointed at the ceiling with her skillet. "Intruder, Tomoe's room."  she answered.</p><p>Naota  nodded. "Ok. Go guard Lia." he ordered, ninja training kicking  in.</p><p>Ikuko  instantly complied with the order, her training kicking in as well.  Going through the kitchen Naota got to the stairwell and started up  it, SOCOM at the ready. When he reached the top of the stairs he saw  Ryusake slumped against the wall amongst  the shattered remains of a door, out cold.</p><p>Sneaking  down the hall Naota saw Ryusake start to move and mentally put him  under as 'okay'. Reaching the door Naota  peeked around the jamb to see his fifteen year old cousin, clad only  in a towel, trying to kill a kitsune with her ninja -to(2).</p><p>"<i>Well, that explains  the screaming."</i> was the first  thought that came to Naotas mind. <i>"And it looks like  Nerima isn't the only place where this sort of thing happens."</i></p><p>Of  course thats when the towel decided to give in to gravity and come  loose.</p><p>Getting  an eyeful of skin the kitsune whistled  appreciatively as Tomoe developed a facial  tic.</p><p>"H-h-HENTAI!"  shrieked Tomoe as she swung for the kitsune's  head.</p><p></p><p>Out in  the guest room Lia snapped awake at Tomoe's outraged shriek. As she  came to Lia was aware of three things: One, her husband wasn't in bed  with her. Two, it sounded like there was a brawl going on in the main  house. And three, she could smell someone else in the room with her.</p><p>"W-who's  there?" she asked, sitting up in bed.</p><p>A  flicker of shadow, the slight creak of weight shifting on the  floorboards. "Ikuko."</p><p>Blinking  a couple of times to get the sleep out of her eyes, Lia was glad for  the Neko -ken and her curse as the world resolved into the washed out  tones that were her nightvision. She could  see Naota's aunt, dressed in a pair of dark blue pajamas and wielding  both a skillet and meat cleaver. Dressed and posed as she was, Ikuko  looked like just another shadow -to someone without a Starlight  scope(3) or the Neko -Ken Improved.</p><p>Throwing  the covers off, Lia padded over to the door where Ikuko was crouched  and listened to the fight raging inside.</p><p>"What's  going on?" she whispered.</p><p>"Intruder."  Ikuko whispered back.</p><p>Lia  winced as a sudden scream followed by several obscenities pierced  through the night. "Sounds like you got a pervert in there."  she whispered, glancing over her shoulder at Ikuko.</p><p>With her  nightvision Lia saw a smirk ghost Ikukos  lips. "A suicidal pervert." she whispered. "All our local ones  know better than to try anything with a kunoichi."</p><p>Listening  to the mayhem raging inside the main house Lia smirked herself. "I  can believe it." she said. "But, no  offense, I don't think you guys have him  under control."</p><p>Ikuko  scowled as she edged closer to the door. "I can assure you, we  <i>ninja </i>can handle a lone pervert."  she whispered, trying not to sound testy.</p><p>"Then  why-" Lia stopped when a loud <i>pop</i> followed by a snarl and  cursing from Naota issued form the house, followed by the sounds of a  body tumbling down the stairs. "Sounds like they got him." she  said as she stood up.</p><p>"Wait!  Don't go out there!" Ikuko hissed as she made a grab for Lia, her  hands closing on empty air. "Shit!"</p><p>Lia was  already going through the back door by the  time Ikuko had stepped out of the guest house. <i>"Wow, she's  fast." </i> was Ikuko's thought as she  raced across the yard.</p><p>As Ikuko  reached the door the kitchen lights came on, and she could hear Lia's  voice coming from inside. As she turned the knob there was a scrabble  of feet on linoleum, followed by the <i>thump</i>  of two bodies hitting the floor.</p><p>Sliding  the door open Ikuko heard a scream of rage and saw a flash. Her  instincts screamed 'bomb' and took over, throwing her down and away  from the door right before a body was sent smashing through the door.</p><p>Ikuko  watched as the body -presumably the intruders- went flying through  the air and smashed into a tree. Wincing at the impact Ikuko looked  up as Lia stepped out onto the porch, her pigtail wreathing like a  snake from her aura.</p><p>"<i>Okay, I didn't know  she could do </i>that<i>."  </i>Ikuko thought as Lia stalked  towards the intruder, pulling a mallet from thin air. <i>"Or  that."</i></p><p>"You..."  Lia ground out from between clench teeth. "You.." she  repeated as the intruder groaned and shook his head.</p><p>Looking  up the intruder saw Lia and blinked. <i>Then</i> he saw her mallet  and his eyes bugged out to the size of dinner plates. "Ah, hey  look, I'm sorry about running into you. I didn't mean to grab your-"  he babbled.</p><p>"DIE!"  Lia screamed as she reared back with the mallet. "HENTAI HAMMER  BASH!" she screamed as s he swung, flooding the weapon with her  supercharged chi.</p><p>Ikuko  felt the whole house shake from the impact, and car alarms were set  off for about a block around. The impact left a two and a half meter  crater in the ground, but the intruder wasn't there.</p><p><i>He </i>was  landing in a crouch a few meters away, right next to the wall  separating the Sano's  property from their neighbors as lights were coming on all over the  neighborhood. Upstairs a window was thrown open, bathing the backyard  in light.</p><p>For a  moment nothing happened, and that's when Ikuko got her first good  look at the intruder. He was tall, about one seventy to one eighty  centimeters(4), thin but well muscled. He was dressed in a black  hakama and blue gray gi,  with paired swords at his waist.</p><p>That  wasn't too weird, just out of the ordinary. What stood out to Ikuko  was the fact that he was barefoot, and his fingers ended in <i>claws</i>,  not fingernails. And when he turned his head, she saw that he had  pointed ears. This made a bell go off in her head, and the bell  became an alarm when he turned slightly she saw he had four fox tails  in the back.</p><p>"<i>Mother Mary, he's  loose! The Fox is loose!"</i> she  thought as she sat up.</p><p>"Now  everyone stay calm..." the Fox began as Naota stepped out onto the  porch and raised his pistol. "Lets not do anything rash- oh shit."</p><p></p><p>Kawashima  quailed as the tai -yokai raised his tanegashima  at him. He had heard about them, powerful weapons that could be  wielded by the most common of humans and capable of taking down all  but the most powerful yokai.</p><p>He knew  that tanegashima had their limitations -they were slow to reload in  comparison to a bow, and you had to keep the match lit so it could  fire. But from the way everything had changed since he was sealed,  Kawashima was sure that tanegashima had undergone similar changes as  well.</p><p>So not  wanting to find out what those changes were, he bolted. Out of the  corner of his eye Kawashima saw the flash of the tanegashima firing  and felt the tug of the ball passing through the sleeve of his gi.  The tanegashima flashed again, and this time fire blossomed in his  shoulder as the ball struck home.</p><p>Letting  out a yelp of pain Kawashima leaped the  fence as the tanegashima flashed a third time and fire lashed him in  the thigh. Clearing the fence he landed in the yard and started  running, trying to get as much space between him and the tanegashima  wielding yokai as possible.</p><p>A few  agonizingly long footsteps later he heard the <i>crack </i>of the  tanegashima for the first time as a ball whipped past his ear. Two  more followed in quick succession, one  catching the leg of his hakama , the other missing him and hitting  the ground in front of him.</p><p>Ahead of  him was another wall, behind it he could see the roof of a shed  poking up like a mushroom. From there he could see there was awning,  which lead to the roof of the house of the house next door. Two more  shots from the tanegashima and Kawashima's  mind was made up for him.</p><p>Clutching  his shoulder -that was going to take a while to heal- and Kawashima  dropped and jumped, clearing the wall and landing on the roof of the  shed. Two more leaps and he was on the roof of the house.</p><p>Hearing  a frustrated snarl behind him Kawashima glanced back and saw the  yokai leap from the shadow of the chimney behind him.</p><p>"<i>Crap." </i></p><p>Kicking  his legs into high gear he was off like a shot, the yokai in hot  pursuit with the kunoichi and the red head trailing them.</p><p></p><p>Naota  snarled as the intruder bounded across the rooftops. The last thing  he was in the mood for was a steeple chase across Mabase  at this hour of the night when he would much rather be in bed, with  Lia.</p><p>Speaking  of his mate, Naota could hear her behind him as she roofhopped  along with him with Tome farther behind. From the way she went after  the intruder Lia was pretty irate, and trying to discourage her from  chasing him would be an exercise in futility.</p><p>And from  what he could see Lia didn't have any trouble in going after him  either. The only problem was what was going to happen when the  intruder decided to quit playing nice and drew the katana at his  waist. Lia had gotten better at dealing with sword attacks when she  and Naota sparred, but there was a <i>big difference</i>  between an oak bokken and live steel.</p><p>While  Naota pondered this he up ahead he saw the  intruder jump to one side suddenly as three kunai  embedded themselves into the roof and two shadows separate  themselves from the chimney. They had just ran into one of the  Hagakure's night patrols.</p><p>In one  fluid motion the intruder turned to face the attacking ninja and  threw something at them from his left hand.</p><p>"Kitsune  -bi!" the intruder shouted and a ridiculously  over sized toy horse appeared between the  ninja, catching them off guard and knocking them off the roof.</p><p>Naota  could have sworn he heard the intruder <i>snicker </i>as he leaped  to another roof. Filing it away for later, Naota leaped over the  horse and continued on his chase. A couple of seconds later a thump  told him that Lia had cleared the horse, followed a few seconds ofter  that by Tomoe.</p><p>Glancing  back to make sure  they were okay Naota looked forwards and saw that they were rapidly  running out of houses. Looking to his right Naota saw two teams of  ninjas running parrelled to then on the  other side of the street, and to the left there was another team of  ninjas doing the same thing.</p><p>Running  through his mental map of Mabase Naota reviewed on what probably lay  in front of them: some fields, a small woods, and... the temple.  That made Naota smile. They were herding him into a trap.</p><p>Reaching  the end of the houses the intruder hopped down to ground and headed  in the direction of the woods at a dead sprint. Hitting  the ground Naota started to accelerate when he saw the intruder  suddenly slam into an invisible wall and get thrown back with a flash  of light.</p><p>Skidding  to a stop a few meters away Naota looked around and saw what he  was looking for: ofuda stuck to fencepost's,  creating a barrier. Further checking revealed other ofuda stuck to  sticks driven into the ground around them, making an open -ended box.</p><p>Putting  his hand to his wounded shoulder the intruder sighed and looked  around the area. "Alright miko, show yourself." he yelled out to  the night. "If your going to seal me away again, at least have the  courage to come out and show your face while you do it."</p><p>There  was a rustle in the grass and Chikako stepped out from behind the  bush that was her hiding place. She was dressed in a t -shirt and  shorts, and was carrying a quiver and bow. Taking in her appearance  the intruder snorted and looked at Naota.</p><p>"And  you let her control you, a tai -yokai?" he asked, nodding at  Chikako.</p><p>Narrowing  his eyes Naota raised his pistol as Lia and Tomoe came up behind  them. "She doesn't control me, <i>fox,</i> and worry about me, not  her." he said as he settled the laser dot on the forehead of the  intruder. "So, what's your name, and why are you here?"</p><p>Sighing again the intruder looked down at his shoulder, then back up  to Naota. "My name is Akahito Kawashima,  and the reason I am here is because I was asked by my sister Asako to  check on some scrolls." he said as Naota's ears perked up.</p><p>"Your  sister's name is Asako?" he asked.</p><p>Akahito  nodded. "Yeah." he said. "She's about yea high-" Akahito held  up his hand at about Asako's hight "-is  really cheerful and nice, has four tails, likes to drive Shessy  -poo nuts?"</p><p>Now  Naota nodded and flipped on the safety of his pistol. "That's her."  he said, sticking the gun in his waistband. Hearing the scrape of  wood on wood, Naota glanced over at Chikako  as she nocked an arrow. "Just what are  you doing?" he asked.</p><p>"Re  -sealing him." Chikako answered, her eyes never leaving Akahito.  "Before he causes any more trouble."</p><p>Seeing  Akahito quail in terror out of the corner of his eye Naota frowned  and shook his head. "Hold off on that,  would ya Chikako?" he asked.</p><p>Lowering  her bow Chikako turned and faced Naota. "Why?" she asked  incredulously.</p><p>"Because  I'm a jonin, and because I said so."  answered Naota. As Chikako spluttered he turned to Tomoe. "Tomoe,  are there any spare rooms at the house?" he asked.</p><p>She  nodded once. "Yeah. Downstairs, there's a walk -in closet." she  said.</p><p>"Good."  Naota said as he pointed to Chikako. "Take her and have her ward  it. The fox can stay there for the time being."</p><p>"What?"  asked Akahito, totally confused.</p><p>"WHAT?"  shrieked Lia, Tomoe, and Chikako, totally outraged.</p><p>"You're  sparing him?" shrieked Tomoe. "He snuck into my room when I was  changing!"</p><p>"By  accident!" Akahito called.</p><p>"And  he snuck into my house and groped me!" Chikako yelled.</p><p>"He  groped me too!" Lia yelled.</p><p>"Hey!"  Naota yelled, his voice rising above the others. "I'm not saying  you cant beat the crap out of him-!" he continued.</p><p>"What?"  Akahito yelped.</p><p>"-just  not kill him or seal him."finished Naota.</p><p>"Oh."  the three women said before turning their gaze to Akahito.</p><p>Sweating  nervously Akahito looked at Naota. "Ah, why are you leaving me to  them?" he asked.</p><p>Looking  over his shoulder Naota leveled his gaze at Akahito. "Because you  interrupted my sleep, that's why." he answered. "Live with it."</p><p>Akahito  swallowed nervously as Lia, Chikako, and Tomoe approached  him. "Help?" he asked weakly.</p><p></p><p>Feeling  sunlight hit her eyes, Bre groaned and rolled over. She lay that way  for a few moments until she realized that something was wrong -the  other half of the bed was empty. Flopping her arm around failed to  locate a certain soldier, so reluctantly Bre cracked open an eye.</p><p>She was  in Evans bedroom, and the clock on the nightstand read 10:47 in the  morning. Blinking a few times Bre rolled over onto her back and then  sat up. The room was in it's usual spit -polished condition, with  everything neatly arranged as if for inspection.</p><p>"<i>Jeez,  this boy needs some decoration."</i>  thought Bre as she noticed that her clothes had been neatly folded  and laid on the dresser.</p><p>Hearing  a sudden <i>beep </i>from the other room Bre shook her head and threw  back the covers. Getting out of bed she adjusted the t -shirt she had  been sleeping in -one of Evans old ones- and padded into the living  room.</p><p>Her  phone was lying in the middle of the coffee table where she could  find it. Popping it open she saw that one of her friends in Iowa had  text ed her. Typing in a reply Bre fired it  off and closed her phone. That's when she realized that the living  room had been cleaned up as well.</p><p>They had  stayed up late, watching sci-fi movies and  eating junk food. And Bre distinctly remembered  the living room being a complete and total mess when they had finally  went to sleep. Shaking her head again Bre wandered over to the  refrigerator in search of breakfast.</p><p>Opening  the door Bre found the shelves mostly empty and a note being propped  up by a paper fox. Picking the note up Bre  read it.</p><p><i>Bre, ran to the store for  some breakfast fixings. Be back soon.</i></p><p><i>Bill.</i></p><p><i>P.S., Sugimura  -san knows about you. </i></p><p>Bre  blinked when she read the last postscript of Evans note. It took her  a moment to remember that he was referring to Mrs. Sugimura, Evans  landlady. She was a widower who had taken over the building when her  husband had died, and looked out for her tenets. From Evans  description of her, Mrs. Sugimura sounded like a kindly old lady.</p><p>Shrugging,  Bre closed the refrigerator door and went  to make coffee. Ten minutes later and she was curling up on  the couch with a steaming mug of fresh coffee and some  cookies she had found in the cupboard. Munching on a cookie Bre  sipped her coffee as she pondered what to watch on TV.</p><p>Her  musings were interrupted by a knock at the door. Putting her coffee  down on the coffee table Bre got up and went to the  door. Looking through the peephole Bre saw a little old lady in a  kimono standing outside.</p><p>"<i>Mrs. Sugimura..."</i>  Bre thought as she stepped back and unlocked the door. "Can I help  you?" she asked.</p><p>Mrs.  Sugimura face crinkled into a smile as she looked Bre up and down.  "I'm Evans -san's landlady." she said.  "I just wanted to check on this mystery girl he has."</p><p>Bre  laughed and nodded. "That's me." she said.</p><p>"Well,  it's nice to finally meet you, mystery girl." Mrs. Sugimura said  with a laugh. "Do you have a name?'</p><p>"Bre  Johnson." Bre replied, which got a surprised look from Mrs.  Sugimura.</p><p>"An  American girl!" she exclaimed. "Trust Evans to find the only  other Nisei(6) in Tokyo."</p><p>Bre  blinked. "Another Nisei?"she asked.</p><p>Mrs.  Sugimura nodded. "His sensei's first  daughter, a little redheaded girl." she said as Bre's  face brightened.</p><p>"Oh,  Lia." she said. "I know her."</p><p>"Have  you met her new husband?" asked Sugimura, to which Bre nodded.</p><p>"Yeah."  she answered. "He's my little brother."</p><p>Sugimura  blinked and then leaned in close to Bre to get a better look at her.  "Your Dokuhotei Sano's granddaughter?" she asked. "You came  back?"</p><p>Bre  shrugged. "Something like that." she answered.</p><p>Sugimura  chuckled. "So, when are you and Evans -san going to get hitched,  hmm?" she asked with a gleam in her eye.</p><p>Bre  chuckled and got a sly look on her face. "Weeellll..." she said  as she leaned in close to Sugimura. "We're still in the early  stages, but I <i>did </i>catch the bouquet  at Lia's wedding, so..."</p><p>Sugimura  chuckled. "Well, it probably wont be all that long..." she said,  eying Bre's shirt.</p><p>Bre  blinked and looked down. "Huh...oh." she said. "I guess wearing  one of his Army t-shirts is kinda of a giveaway." she added.</p><p>"Among  other things." Sugimura said. "Well, I have to be going, so it  was nice to meet you Johnson -san." she added with a bow.</p><p>"As it  was for me Sugimura -san." Bre answered as she returned the bow.</p><p>As  Sugimura walked off Bre shut the door to  other apartment and let out a sigh, leaning  up against the door. Staying there for a few moments, Bre then walked  back to the couch to finish her coffee and cookies.</p><p>Bre had  gotten herself a refill of her coffee when she heard a key in the  lock and the bolt flip open.</p><p>"I'm  home." Evans called as he stepped into the apartment, grocery bags  in hand. "Oh, you're awake." he said when he saw Bre.</p><p>"Yeah."  Bre said as she got off of the couch. "I've been up for the last  forty -five minutes."</p><p>Kicking  the door shut with his heel Evans then headed to the kitchen with his  purchases. "Oh. By the, I ran into my landlord when I was going out  -" he began.</p><p>"I  know." Bre said as she stepped into the kitchen. "She stopped by  a few minutes before you showed up."</p><p>"Oh."  Evans said as he put the bags on the counter. "What'd you two talk  about?"</p><p>Grabbing   a bag Bre started to take groceries out."Oh, this and that." she  said. "We talked about Lia, the Kitten, and how long it's going to  be until we get hitched." she added, watching out of the corner of  her eye as Evans fumbled and almost dropped the bag of rice he was  holding.</p><p>"Is  that all?" Evans asked as he put the rice away in the cupboard.</p><p>Bre  nodded as she stepped around Evans to get to the refrigerator. "Yep."  she said. "But that reminds me, we got to get everybody together  for the lovebirds honeymoon."</p><p>Evans  thought for a second, then nodded. "Oh, Lia and Naota's." he  said, shaking his head.</p><p>Bre  laughed and punched Evans on the arm. "Yes, Lia and Naota's, you  dummy." she said. "We're gonna be dragging them to Iowa,  remember?"</p><p>Evans  nodded as he shut the cupboard door. "Yeah, I remember." he said.  "We're gonna get everything finalized." he added, then snapped  his fingers. "Oh, that reminds me. My leave was approved."</p><p>Bre  giggled as she bounced on the balls of her feet. "That's great!"  she exclaimed as she clamped onto Evans  arm. "A whole month of you, all to myself." she purred as she  nuzzled Evans arm.</p><p>Evans  nodded as he pulled some more groceries out of the bags. "Uh, yeah  but, Naota and Lia are gonna be there too, along with Matoko and  Kenji." he pointed out.</p><p>Bre  looked up at Evans and gave him a big grin. "Yeah, but Naota is  gonna be focused on Lia, and we <i>both </i>know where the tall twins  attention is gonna be focused."</p><p>"Manga?"  Evans asked.</p><p>Letting  go of Evans Bre scowled and crossed her arms. "Not if I can help  it." she growled. "I'm dragging them along on this trip so they  can develop their relationship without having to worry about Ranma  busting in and killing Kenji, <i>not </i>so they can just sit inside  all day and work." she added. "They're off to a great start, but  they just need a little help."</p><p>Evans  nodded as he finished putting the rest of the groceries away. "I  agree." he said. "Ranma is a good father, but he is a little on  the overprotective side."</p><p>Bre  nodded. "I agree." she nodded, turning around to face Evans and  striking a 'cute' pose. "But can we make breakfast? I'm kinda  hungry."</p><p>Evans  looked at her for a moment, then laughed. "Sure." he said,  reaching for the cupboard.</p><p></p><p>The  bells over the door jingled as Ukyuo  stepped into the tiny coffee shop/ net cafe',  middle of nowhere, Korea. Wanting more regular contact with her  daughter and tired of having to figure out exact postage from  whatever location they happened to be in, Ukyo had included an e  -mail address in her last letter. Hoping for a reply she bought a  coffee and grabbed a terminal.</p><p>Setting  her pack down beside her Ukyo mused on the fact that she had  conversed with the clerk in near perfect Korean, and how she never  would have imagined that she'd become fluent in several other  languages. Opening up the browser, Ukyo went to her Hotmail  account and accessed it.</p><p>The  inbox showed that she had three new e  -mails. Two were from Hotmail itself, thanking her for joining, and  offering her several exciting new features. Deleting them Ukyo moved  on to the other, which was from a 'coyotekun'.</p><p>Opening  it up she saw that her hopes had been answered. It was from Mamimi.</p><p>"<i>Hi Mom!</i></p><p><i>I got your letter the  other day and I saw your e -mail address so I answered it. Now we can  write each other more! I've been doing good in school, all A's! And  I've been helping Chris -chan with his homework, so now he's getting  A's too!"</i></p><p>Ukyo  blinked for a second, then re -read the paragraph. She hadn't misread  anything, Mamimi had referred to a boy as a girl. Shaking her head  and feeling slightly concerned for her daughters schooling, Ukyo read  on.</p><p>"<i>I don't think you've  gotten my last letter yet, so I'll tell you whats been happening: One  of Chris -chan's big sisters got married! I  got to wear a really cute kimono and dressed up Chris -chan too. I  have pictures too!'</i></p><p>Grabbing  her coffee Ukyo clicked on the attachments  link, and when the photos came up she choked on her drink. Her  daughter had grown quite a bit since she'd last seen her, and her  fathers heritage was starting to come out.</p><p>But what  had caught Ukyo by surprise were the trio  of redheads in the photo. The oldest was definitely Ranma, there  could be no doubt. The second redhead, dressed in a wedding kimono  and seated next to a <i>very </i> cute looking boy with -<i>cats  ears?</i></p><p>Looking  closer Ukyo saw that she wasn't imagining things. The boy did indeed  have cats ears, and gold stripes on his face. And the second redhead  had cats ears as well now that she looked.</p><p>"<i>Oh Ranma, nothing is  ever </i>normal <i>for you,  is it" </i>thought Ukyo as she  looked at the last redhead.</p><p>The  final redhead at first glance looked like a nine year old Ranma -chan  with a ponytail, but closer examination revealed that her kimono was  over sized on her, and was a boys kimono.  That's when she remembered her daughter's use of tense and it dawned  on her.</p><p>This  Chris -chan had his fathers curse. Which puzzled her, because if he  had inherited it, then Ranma's daughter  should have Akanes curse and Mamimi should have her fathers Juseynko  curse.</p><p>"Oh  <i>crud.</i>" Ukyo said as she stared at the photo. "Ryouga."</p><p><i>That </i>was  a problem she hadn't even considered. How would he react to his  daughter being friends with the son of his rival? All those years  ago, when he had first found out about Ranma and Akane, he had been  in shock for the first few days afterwards. Then he had ranted and  raved like a madman for days.</p><p>After  using the Shi Shi Hokkaden  and putting several new craters in the Japanese countryside, he had  started wandering with Ukyo in tow. For months they had wandered,  lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>Then one  day, they started to talk. Ukyo was the first on of them to speak.  She talked about her and Ranma when they were kids, and the fun they  had. Then for days afterwards neither of them said anything. Then  Ryouga spoke, talking about how Akane made him feel.</p><p>This  went on for weeks, each telling the other about how they felt about  Ranma and Akane, and their adventures. Sometimes there was screaming  and yelling, and other times there were tears. They laid each others  souls open to each other, and they discovered they liked what they  saw.</p><p>Carefully,  tentatively, they became lovers. And  finally were able to let go of the emotional baggage that they had  been carrying for years and got on with their lives. Ryouga still  considered Ranma his rival, but destroying his happiness wasn't  Ryouga's focus anymore.</p><p>And  instead of bemoaning his atrocious directional sense, he began to  enjoy it and the adventures it led him on.</p><p>For  Ukyo, she was quite happy to just wander along with Ryouga. No goal,  no major focus in her life, just chasing the horizon.</p><p>Then one  day in Hong Kong she and Ryouga had stopped in at a clinic to see why  she had been throwing up so much. Ranma and Akane's  return was nothing compared to the bombshell that got dropped in  their lap that day: Ukyo was pregnant.</p><p>They  made their way to a Hibiki clan home in northern Japan and stayed  there while Ukyo carried Mamimi to term. Waiting until Mamimi was  old enough to travel, they then struck out again. From Japan they  went to China, traveling the breadth of that country into Russia.</p><p>They  wandered through Russia into Europe via Poland. From there they took  the scenic route, going through Germany, France, Belgium,  then back through France into Spain. Then  they wandered along the coast of the Mediterranean,  ending up in Italy.</p><p>Then  they went through the Alps back into France, traveling across  that country to Great Britain. Then from  there they went across the Atlantic -for the life of her Ukyo <i>still  </i>can't figure out how they manage to cross large bodies of water  without a boat- and ended up in New York.</p><p>Then  they did a grand tour of the United States, going through almost all  of the lower forty -eight before ending up in Canada. They did quite  a bit of wandering through B.C. Before ending up in Alaska. They were  resting in Anchorage when they both realized that Mamimi was school  age, and they had a long discussion about the education of their  daughter.</p><p>So they  began the long trek home, crossing the Bering Strait into Russia and  going down the coast until they could cross over into the Kuril  Islands. From there they went down into Japan proper and Ukyo took  over the navigation. Finally they reached Nerima. They registered  Mamimi in school, showed her the route to and from school, and to  various other places until she had them memorized. Then one day with  out realizing it they had simply wandered off and were now in Burma  -which was odd, because they had been originally been going to the  store.</p><p>So they  shrugged, and continued on, wandering Southeast Asia until they ended  up in a small town in the middle of Korea. Which brought Ukyo back to  her original problem. Drumming her fingers against the table Ukyo  thought hard for a few seconds before reaching a decision.</p><p>Clicking  the 'print' button, Ukyo printed out a copy of the photo's, then  closed the browser.</p><p>"<i>better wait until  </i>after<i> I tell her  father before I e -mail her back." </i>thought  Ukyo as she got up from her seat.</p><p>After  she paid for the printouts Ukyo grabbed her pack and set out for the  campsite that she and Ryouga had set up.</p><p></p><p>Humming  a tune that'd been getting a lot of airtime on the radio lately,  Asako twirled in front of the mirror. Her shop had gotten a new  shipment in and she was 'checking the merchandise'(6). Pausing, she  twitched her tails down to get a better look at her back.</p><p>As she  was studying the lines of what she was wearing her cell rang.  Startled out of her trance, Asako shook her head and strode over to  the table to answer it. Picking it up she glanced at the display,  which read 'Naota'.</p><p>"<i>Hm.  I wonder </i>why <i>he's  calling?"</i> she thought as she  hit the talk button. "Hello." she said into the phone.</p><p>"Hey  Asako." Naota's voice came over the phone. "It's Naota."</p><p>"Hey  Naota." Asako said as she walked back to the mirror. "What's up?"</p><p>Over the  line Asako heard Naota clear his throat before he answered. "This  is gonna sound strange, but, do you have a brother named -" he  began as Asako's face twitched into a grin.</p><p>"-Akahito  Kawashima?" she finished. "Yeah, I do. The dummy got himself  sealed away up where you are a couple of hundred years ago."</p><p>Over the  phone Asako could hear Naota give off a low annoyed growl. "That  you forgot to tell me about."</p><p>Asako  shrugged as she resumed checking herself out in the mirror. "Well,  I forgot." she said.</p><p>A smack  of flesh on flesh told Asako that Naota had just clapped his hand to  his forehead. "Asako, just <i>how </i>do you forget something like  that?" he asked.</p><p>Asako  sighed and reminded herself that Naota was still young, and still  thinking like a human. "When you're six hundred, see how much <i>you  </i>remember." she retorted. "Anyways, how is my dear big brother  Akahito?" she asked.</p><p>"<i>Big  </i>brother?" Naota asked, surprised. "He's got three tails."</p><p>"So?"  Asako asked, twisting so she could get a look at herself from the  side.</p><p>"<i>You're  </i>a six tail." Naota pointed out.</p><p>Asako's  grin got even bigger. "Naota, we kitsune's don't get tails with  age." she said. "We get them by becoming more and more skilled."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Think  of it like martial arts." explained Asako. "The more you learn  and become proficient with, the higher in  rank you get."</p><p>"Ah."  answered Naota. "So what do you want us to with him?"</p><p>Turning  around Asako got a look at herself from the other side. "Well,  don't seal him again. He's harmless, really." she said. "He just  tends to chase the ladies."</p><p><i>That </i>got  a rumbling growl from Naota. "So I noticed." he said. "Last  night he groped the local miko-"</p><p>"Ooh,  she must be cute."</p><p>Naota  snorted. "If you like mikos, yeah. Then  he dropped in on my cousin Tomoe after her bath." he continued.  "But I think the last one was an accident."</p><p>Asako  chuckled as she listened to Naota's description of the previous  night's events. "Sounds like the being sealed didn't affect him."  she said. "I'll call my father and have him send up a car  tomorrow."</p><p>"Cool."  Naota said. There was a pause for a moment before he continued, which  Asako imagined him looking around to make sure the coast was clear.  "By the way, about the stuff you sold Lia,.."</p><p>"Yes?"  Asako asked, mischief in her voice.</p><p>"Thank  you."</p><p>Asako  laughed as her phone beeped. "Look, I got another call. After I  talk to my father I'll let you know when the car's coming, okay?"  she said.</p><p>"Ok."  answered Naota.</p><p>Switching  to the other call Asako held the phone up to her ear. "Kawashima."</p><p>'Hey  Asako." Asako's face immediately brightened at the sound of  Takata's voice. "What's up?"</p><p>Asako  shrugged as she turned around to face the mirror. "Oh, nothing  much.' she said. "Just trying on some lingerie."  she added, as on the other end Takata choked and lapsed into a  coughing fit. "You okay, Takata?"</p><p>"Yeah."  Takata rasped after his coughing fit had passed. "You just caught  me by surprise there."</p><p>"Oh,  sorry." Asako said.</p><p>"It's  okay." Takata said. "The mental image just popped into my mind  for a second and I tried to breathe down the wrong pipe."</p><p>Asako  let out a chuckle as she imagined Takata caught by surprise. "Well,  ya gotta admit I <i>do </i>have quite <i>bountiful </i>reasons for  being distracting." she said, her tails swishing.</p><p>Takata  gibbered for a few moments, then composed himself. "Cut that out!"  he said. "I'm at work. Someone will see!" he added in a whisper.</p><p>"Are  you on your desk phone?" Asako asked, twirling around in front of  the mirror.</p><p>"No.  My cell." answered Takata.</p><p>"Are  you in your office?" Asako continued.</p><p>"Yeah."  Takata answered. 'No one can see me. But this place is full of  gossips, and my boss is my father in law."</p><p>"Ahhh..."  Asako said with a nod, understanding where Takata was coming from.  "You just don't want to take chances."</p><p>"Jackpot."  Takata said. "Anyways, I was calling to say I'll be in the  neighborhood in a couple of days, and I was wondering if we could get  together?"</p><p>For a  brief moment Asako felt like she was a one  -tail again. "Sure." she said. "Is my place okay?" she asked.  "I make a <i>really</i> nice sukiyaki."</p><p>"It's  perfect." answered Takata. "I'll call you when I'm heading over."</p><p>"Cool."  Asako said with a slight nod. "See you then."</p><p>"See  you then." Takata said before hanging up.</p><p>Closing  her cell phone Asako pursed her lips as she considered her  reflection. <i>"Okay, so what would go good </i>over <i>this?"</i>she  asked herself.</p><p></p><p>Reading  a book by the fire as supper cooked, Ryouga looked up when he heard a  pebble clatter over some stones.</p><p>"Who's  there?"</p><p>"It's  just me." Ukyo called as she stepped out from behind a boulder. "I  smell dinner." she added, sniffing the air.</p><p>Marking  his place, Ryouga nodded. "It's about done, I'd say." he said,  lifting the lid to check it. "Did you get anything?"</p><p>"Yeah,  actually, ah, did." Ukyo said as she sat her pack down.</p><p>Hearing  his wife's hesitation Ryouga looked up from what he was doing. "Is  something wrong?" he asked. "Is Mamimi okay?"</p><p>"Mamimi  is okay." Ukyo said. "It's just..."</p><p>"It's  just what?" asked Ryouga, putting the spoon he was using down and  turning to face her.</p><p>Chewing  on her lip for a few moments, Ukyo pondered on how to tell Ryouga.  "Here, let me show you." she said, going to her pack. Pulling the  folded up printouts from her pack she handed them to her husband.  "Take a look."</p><p>Taking  the printouts, Ryouga unfolded them and took a look. "Oh, it's  Mamimi." he said. "And she's got some friends..." he added,  trailing off as he got a good look at who was sitting next to his  daughter.</p><p>"See?"  Ukyo said as she sat down.</p><p>Wordlessly,  Ryouga nodded. Putting down the printouts, he sighed and looked up at  the sky.</p><p>"My  daughter is friends with the son of the man I considered my rival."  he said. "I think the gods are laughing."</p><p>Ukyo  snorted as adjusted herself into a comfortable position.  "Probably." she said.</p><p>Ryouga  nodded as he studied the printout. "My, she's grown.' he murmured,  tracing a finger along Mamimi in the photo.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Ryouga  looked up at his wife. "Mamimi. She's grown." he explained.</p><p>Ukyo  nodded once. "Yeah, she has." she said.</p><p>Ryouga  winced mentally at how Ukyo spoke. Glancing back down he took a long  look at his daughter's photo, and realized an important truth: His  daughter was growing up, fast. He and Ukyo had left her in Nerima so  she could get a decent education and she was.</p><p>It was  just that Ukyo wanted to be with their daughter, and deep down Ryouga  knew he did too. They had spent almost the last dozen years running  away from Nerima and their past. But now he had more important things  to worry about.</p><p>Putting  down the printout Ryouga checked dinner,  tasting it with a spoon. Satisfied that it was done, he put the spoon  down and turned back to his wife.</p><p>"Dinner's  ready." he said, getting a nod from Ukyo. Grabbing a bowl he began  to dish up. "I was thinking it's time we start heading back  tomorrow." he added , handing the bowl to Ukyo.</p><p>Startled,  Ukyo almost dropped her bowl. "Y-you're sure?" she asked.</p><p>Nodding,  Ryouga began to fill his own bowl. "Yeah.' he said. "I think so.  Mamimi's growing up, and I want to be  there."</p><p>"Me  too." Ukyo said, a trace of a smile appearing on her face. "I'd  better check our maps." she added. "I'll need to find us a way  home."</p><p></p><p>Kyuubi  Kawashima, nine tailed fox and lord of all the kitsune's, sighed  contentedly and leaned back against his chair. It had been a long day  and now it was time to relax and enjoy the rare moment of silence.</p><p>Moments  lie these, he reflected, are all too rare. There were no children or  grandchildren about, the servants were done for the day, and there  was no TV or other electronic devices playing.</p><p>"<i>At last, peace and  quiet."</i> thought Kyuubi as he  relaxed. <i>"This won't last long, so I had better enjoy  it." </i>he added. <i>"Note  to self: get Sesshy -poo wound up.</i>"</p><p>Slowly,  a smile crept across Kyuubi's face as  schemes began to play out in his mind. He had just thought up a  promising idea when he was jarred back to reality by the sliding open  of the shoji screen.</p><p>He  listened as the servant stepped inside the room, knelt down and  closed the door before approaching. As she approached he got a whiff  of her scent and immediately identified her as Jun, one of the  serving staff.</p><p>"Yes?'  he asked when Jun got close.</p><p>Kyuubi  heard her gasp slightly and swallow nervously. She was a one tail,  and not a very powerful one to boot, thus she was just a little bit  nervous around stronger oni and demons.</p><p>Opening  his eyes, he looked at Jun, who was kneeling a short distance away.  The girl was tiny, 147cm(7) tall and tipping the scales at 40  kilos(7). She was dressed in a leaf pattern kimono in varying  patterns of green that went well with her bright red hair.</p><p>"Well?"  he asked. "What is it?"</p><p>Jun  swallowed nervously before addressing her lord. "Lord Kyuubi,  there's a phone call for you." she said, holding up the tray she  had been carrying.</p><p>"From  who?" Kyuubi asked, slightly annoyed by Jun's nervousness.</p><p>Another  nervous swallow. "L-lady Asako." stammered Jun.</p><p>Kyuubi  'hmm'd and picked up the wireless handset that was on the tray Jun  was holding. Pressing the talk button he put the phone to his ear.</p><p>"Hello?"  he asked.</p><p>"Daddy!"</p><p>Hearing  his daughters squeal of delight, a grin spread across Kyuubi's face.  "Asako! What are you up to?" he asked.</p><p>Asako  chuckled. "Not much." she said. "I just got some interesting  news." she added.</p><p>That  perked Kyuubi's attention. "What kind of information?" he asked.</p><p>"Well,  you remember that little mission you had  Akahito do, up in the mountains?" Asako asked.</p><p>Kyuubi  nodded as he sat up in his chair. "Yes, I remember." he said. "He  ended up getting sealed."</p><p>'Well,  he's unsealed."</p><p>"<i>WHAT?"  </i>shouted Kyuubi, sitting up straight in his chair and scaring Jun  half to death. "How?"</p><p>Kyuubi  imagined his daughter shrugging before she answered. "I don't  know." she said. "Naota didn't say-" she continued before her  father cut her off with a growl.</p><p>"<i>He's  </i>there?" Kyuubi asked. "The new lord demon?"</p><p>A slight  rustle over the phone told him his daughter was nodding. "Yeah.  He's up there on his honeymoon." Asako said. "I take it that's  important?" she asked.</p><p>On his  end Kyuubi nodded and stood up suddenly, startling Jun and making her  jump backwards in surprise. "Of course it's important." he said,  shooting Jun an annoyed look and making her kow  tow in fear. "Your brother is just a three tail, Asako. Those wards  were only meant to contain your brother. If Naota were to get  anywhere near them -and he most likely <i>did </i>-they'd go up in  smoke."</p><p>"Oh."  Asako said, surprise at missing the obvious in her voice. "Well,  anyways, I asked Naota to not have him sealed again, and said I'd  have you send up a car tomorrow to pick him up."</p><p>Kyuubi  listened to his daughter, mentally counted to ten, then he spoke.  "Asako, your brother is currently in the middle of the Hagakure  clan's territory. They have a nasty tendency to kill demons, like you  or I." he said calmly. "And you expect me to send a <i>CAR  THERE?</i>"</p><p>there  was silence on the other end for a few seconds before Asako answered.  "You don't have to yell." she said. "I <i>told </i>Naota that  you'd be sending a car up, so they'll be expecting you and wont  attack."</p><p>Rubbing  his forehead Kyuubi ground his teeth as he looked at the now  thoroughly terrified Jun. "Can you  guarantee that?" he asked.</p><p>"Of  course I can!" Asako answered cheerfully, her grin plainly evident  in her voice. "I sell naughty things to his wife! If something  happens, she'd mallet him into next week!"</p><p><i>'By the nine hells, it's  a suicide mission.' </i>thought  Kyuubi as a headache began to form in his temples. "Well, okay,  against my better judgment, I'll send the  Bentley up there tomorrow." he said. "But  you're going along personally, and if anything happens to the car I'm  busting you <i>and </i>your  brother back down to one tail, got it?"</p><p>'Got  it." Asako answered. "And thank you Daddy."</p><p>"You're  welcome Asako." Kyuubi said as he contemplated what to do with Jun.  "Talk to you later."</p><p>"Later  Daddy!" Asako said before she hung up.</p><p>Turning  off the phone Kyuubi crossed his arms as he stared down at Jun.  Tapping his foot, he was wondering what to do with her and who send  out to retrieve his son when an idea hit him. He could do both.</p><p>"Jun."  he said, standing over her. "Knock that cowering off and look at  me."</p><p>Twitching  at the mention of her name, the little kitsune carefully eased  herself up into a kneeling position in front of Kyuubi.</p><p>"Y-yes,  my lord?" she asked hesitantly, trying hard to keep her fear of him  out of her voice.</p><p>Again,  Kyuubi was annoyed by her fear, but kept it out of his voice,  sounding as if nothing was the matter. "I have three tasks for  you." he began as he walked to a table set against one wall.  "First, go and find the two tail Gennosuke  Katsu, and the three tail Aki  Dazi. Tell them they are to drive out  tomorrow to pick up my son. Gennosuke is to drive, and Aki is for  security.' he continued as he took out brush, ink, and paper. "If  they balk at my orders, remind them that I did cover their losses at  the pachinko parlor and thus saved them  from the wrath of their wives."</p><p>Pausing,  dipped his brush into the ink and wrote out a short message onto the  paper. When he finished, Kyuubi picked it up and waved it gently back  and forth to dry the ink as he resumed his instructions. "Second,  this note is for my son. After you are done relaying my orders to  those two idiots, you are are to deliver this note to Asako for her  to deliver to my son." he said, looking over the note to confirm  that the ink was dry. Folding the note up into origami he continued.  "Third, you are to remain with Asako and learn from her on how to  be a kitsune. Tell her I leave the shape of the lessons to her  discretion." he finished, handing the folded note to Jun. "Now  go."</p><p>Collecting  the note from Kyuubi, Jun bowed once and left as fast as protocol  allowed her. As soon as the shoji slid closed Kyuubi sighed and  massaged his forehead. "Where did I go wrong with her?" he asked  the empty room.</p><p></p><p>"<i>1:43  AM."</i></p><p>Takata  sighed as he stepped off the elevator onto his floor. He had been  putting in massive amounts of overtime on the latest acquisition  his company was working on, and was bone tired. Takata knew that as  the CEO's favorite son -in -law, he could  have gone home at five and no one would've said anything.</p><p>He could  be spending quality time with his kids, helping them with their  homework, doing all the things Japanese salarymen  had time for. But that also meant he would have had to spend time  with the Wife.</p><p>The Wife  was Asuka Mashida, formerly Asuka Atsushi,  youngest daughter to Hidetsugu Atsushi, CEO  of MegaTech. She was also a completely  spoiled brat.</p><p>She  spent money hand over fist, insisting on  wearing the latest designs and newest electronic  gadgets for their home -which was in the most ultra chic building in  the Tokyo high rent district. Every year they had a new car -even  though they <i>maybe </i>drove 8000 kilometers in a year- and their  children went to the one of the most exclusive prep schools in all of  Japan.</p><p>The only  upshot to all of this was that it was her fathers money that was  paying for all this.</p><p>When he  had married her, Takata had <i>thought </i>he loved her. And had  tried to convince himself of it for years afterwards.</p><p>But  after the birth of their second child, Takata began to have doubts.  It was they way Asuka seemed a little embarrassed  by her husband at the parties they went to. It was her going out  shopping and a night out on the town with her girlfriends  two to three nights a week. It was <i>him </i>remembering their  anniversary and <i>her </i>forgetting.</p><p>But what  had really opened his eyes to the truth was when he had taken a  couple of vacation days to see his daughter compete in a school play,  and Asako had thrown a mini -fit about having to come. That's when  his eyes had been opened.</p><p>Now the  only reason why he was sticking with it was the kids. And as soon as  he could have a sit down with the men on the Sano family, he was  <i>gone</i>.</p><p>Until  then, he was going to keep up the charade. For the kids sake. That's  what he told himself as he slid his key in the lock and unlocked the  door. Quietly as he could, Takata swung the door open.</p><p>Only to  see the light from the living room spilling into the genkan.</p><p>"<i>Crap. She's awake."  </i>he thought, putting his  briefcase down.</p><p>Pulling  his shoes off, Takata picked up his briefcase again, squared his  shoulders, and walked into the living room.</p><p>In the  living room, Asuka was sitting on the couch, waiting for him. "I  called you today." she said as Takata came in. "Or rather, I  called your <i>secretary.</i>"</p><p>Takata  nodded as he put his briefcase in the coat closet. "Yeah. I  noticed." he said, shutting the door.</p><p>Crossing  her arms, Asuka's annoyed glare bored into  Takata's back. "Well?" she asked.</p><p>"Well  what?" Takata asked, yanking off his tie as he turned around. <i>"Well  </i>shit.<i> She's pissed. It's the couch tonight."</i> he thought  as he got a look at her glare.</p><p>Asuka's  expression turned from annoyed to angry as she untucked  her legs and stood up. "Well, was it too much to have you call  back?" she asked. "You know, so I'd know how late you were going  to be working tonight?"</p><p>Takata  sighed as he started to shrug off his suit jacket. "Look, I told  you when we started the acquisition I'd probably be home no earlier  than midnight." he said, raising a hand as Asuka opened her mouth  to speak. "And before you say anything, I  didn't call back because I was busy calling the other guys involved  in this before they got too drunk to think straight."</p><p>Putting  his coat on the nearest chair Takata walked into the kitchen,  seriously annoying Asuka in the process.  Walking straight over to the chair she snatched up Takata's coat and  glared at him as he got a beer.</p><p>"Five  minutes." she said, tapping her foot.</p><p>Opening  his beer Takata looked up at his wife. "What?" he asked.</p><p>"All  it would have taken was <i>five minutes </i>of your time to call home  to your <i>wife </i>so you'd know that there's a gallery opening this  weekend and that we're going <i>to be there.</i>" Asuka ground out  between clenched teeth. "I assume you can make it?"</p><p>With a  groan Takata leaned back against the fridge  and massaged his forehead with his free hand. "Great... just  great." he muttered.</p><p>Putting  her hands on her hips Asuka gave him an irritated look. "What?"  she asked. "You were planning to be in the office?"</p><p>Taking a  swig of his beer Takata shook his head. "No." he said. "I was  planning on spending what little time off I <i>have </i>with our  <i>children</i>." he added as he dropped his hand to his side. "You  do remember our children, right?"</p><p>Letting  out an exasperated groan Asuka just closed  her eyes and shook her head. "Takata, you have no class  whatsoever." she said, tossing his suit jacket at him. "I no idea  what my father sees in you."</p><p>Turning  on her heel, Asuka strode off to the master bedroom in a huff and  shut the door behind her.</p><p>Standing  in the middle of the kitchen with his coat draped over his head and  shoulders, Takata shrugged. <i>"Huh."</i> he thought to himself  as he pulled his coat off. <i>"That went  better than I expected."</i></p><p>Taking another swig  of beer Takata turned around and started to rummage through the  fridge looking for dinner</p><p></p><p>End.</p><p>Okay, a quick explanation for the updates (Or lack thereof):</p><p>As of late, my  updates have been very sporadic as compared to in the past. The  reason why is because I now work in a factory, and I have very little  time in the morning to write, and when I get home I'm too tired,  which sucks. Maj orly. Mainly the only time  I have to write is on the weekends and the odd holiday, and my  schedule's been pretty full even then.</p><p>So, just be  patient, and I'll try to keep pounding them out as soon as life  permits. And no yelling at Gypsy Girl, please. She's scary with that  mallet...</p><p>(1)Tuned  floorboards. It's an old trick, so if you have an intruder who  doesn't know the house he makes all sorts  of noise.</p><p>(2)That's a  short sword, with a single edge, like a katana.</p><p>(3)That's  what's commonly called 'night vision.</p><p>(4)That's  about 4' 10", 88 pounds. Like I said, she's <i>tiny.</i></p><p>(5)Japanese  term for matchlock. Being sealed away for a few hundred years kind of  leaves one of the loop when it comes to weapons development.</p><p>(6)Or in other  words, playing dress up.</p><p>(7)That's 4',  10"       (   (8)That's 90 lbs</p>
