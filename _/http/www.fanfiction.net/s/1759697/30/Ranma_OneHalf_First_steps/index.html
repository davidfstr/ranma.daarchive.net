</div><p>1Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Three.</p><p>Chapter 10.</p><p>The Saotome house was ablaze with light and was full of people. The whole extended family had gathered there to celebrate the sixteenth anniversary of Ranma and Akanes triumphant return to Japan.</p><p>Normally they would have celebrated it earlier in the year but differing work schedules had forced their pushing it back a few months.</p><p>Inside the house it was a hive of activity. Ono, Genda, Izu, Chisu, Christian, and Mamimi(1) were having a 'bull session' while Soun and Genma played shogi and drank sake.</p><p>In the kitchen Nodoka, Matoko, and Kasumi were cooking up a storm while Akane, Nabiki, and Lia helped out while in the dojo Ranma and Tatewaki were discussing martial arts.</p><p>"Dinner!" Matoko called out.</p><p>Instantly everyone was drawn to the table.</p><p>"What are we having?" Christian asked in true Saotome fashion.</p><p>"A lot." Matoko answered.</p><p>"What is it?" Mamimi asked as she looked at the food in front of her. "I don't recognize some of it."</p><p>"Oh, thats because some of it is Western." Matoko told her.</p><p>"Oh. How come?" Mamimi asked.</p><p>"Because Lias an American." Christian told her.</p><p>Mamimi blinked in surprise and looked at Lias.</p><p>"You are? You don't sound like it." Mamimi said.</p><p>"That's because I've lost it over the years." Lias answered. "If I get excited it comes back and I lapse back into English."</p><p>"You still speak English?" Mamimi asked.</p><p>"<b>Yes, Mamimi I still speak English." </b>Lias answered in her native tongue. <b>"I've made sure to keep fluent."</b></p><p>"Eep!" Mamimi said as her eyes went wide.</p><p>Christian snickered as Mamimi scooted back a few centimeters in surprise.</p><p>"Don't worry Mamimi. She does that to everyone at least once." he said.</p><p>"Especially my English teachers." Lia added. "It's fun to mess with their heads."</p><p>"How do they take it?" Mamimi asked as she retook her seat.</p><p>"Most of the time they give me bucket duty." Lia answered. "Which is good cause I get to avoid a boring class."</p><p>Passing her bowl to Matoko Lia snapped her fingers.</p><p>"That reminds me. I haven't shown Naota I can do that." she said with an devilish grin.</p><p>Mamimi and Christian both looked at the happily purring catgirl and both scooted a couple of centimeters away from her just in case.</p><p>After dinner Lia was exempted from clearing the table, it being about her arrival. Being too full of Nodoka, Matoko and Kasumis cooking to practice she watched TV.</p><p>Sitting there Lia found herself thinking about her home town.</p><p>"<i>I wonder what kind of tractor is sitting in front of the John Deere plant?" </i>she wondered. <i>"I wonder whats changed?" </i></p><p>Catching a flash of movement out of the corner of her eye Lia looked over and saw her brother and his sister in an animated debate. Chuckling to herself Lia looked back at the TV.</p><p>"<i>Christians more Japanese than I am." </i>she thought.</p><p>With a sigh Lia stood up and walked outside. From her vantage point in the kitchen Matoko saw her sister leave and frowned. From Lias tail and ears Matoko knew something was wrong and the rest of Lias body language pointed to a trip to the roof.</p><p>Drying her hands Matoko took off her apron and hung it up.</p><p>"I'll be back in a minute." Matoko said to the rest of the women. "Lia forgot her coat."</p><p>Grabbing her coat as well as Lias Matoko slipped her shoes on and stepped out of the mud room. Walking along the side of the house she saw her sister standing on the roof looking out over the horizon.</p><p>Getting onto the ladder that was left leaning against the building for that purpose Matoko climbed up onto the roof.</p><p>"Hi Matoko." Lia said.</p><p>"Hi Lia." Matoko answered. "You forgot your coat."</p><p>"Oh, thanks." Lia said as she took her coat.</p><p>Standing on the roof with Lia Matoko looked out over where Lia had, towards the eastern horizon where the skies were darkening.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"I'm fine. Why do you ask?" Lia answered.</p><p>"Because your on the roof." her sister pointed out. "And your tails low, and that's an indication that something's on your mind."</p><p>"Oh." Lia said as she glanced backwards at her tail. "I was thinking about Iowa. About what life'd be like if I was still living there."</p><p>"You miss it, don't you?" Matoko asked.</p><p>Lia nodded. "Sometimes." she answered. "Like today, when I'm reminded of it."</p><p>"Oh." Matoko answered with a nod.</p><p>Lia sighed as she looked at the eastern horizon.</p><p>'You know Matoko, I still think like an American." she said.</p><p>Matoko looked at her sister in surprise.</p><p>"How so?" she asked.</p><p>"Well, when I think about how tall you are, I think of you as six foot, not a hundred and eighty-three centimeters." Lia said. "Thats what I mean."</p><p>"Oh." Matoko said. "Do you want to go back?"</p><p>"No. I may have been born an American, but Nerima is where my family is." she said. "The only connection I have to Iowa is that I born there."</p><p>"I see. But you still consider yourself American, not Japanese." Matoko said.</p><p>"Exactly." Lia answered. "And I'm damn proud of it."</p><p>Matoko chuckled as she looked at her sister.</p><p>"Well, that's good to hear." she said. "But can we go inside now? I don't know about you, but I'm freezing."</p><p>"That's because you're wearing a skirt." Lia said as they walked to the edge of the roof. "I keep telling you, pants are better."</p><p>Two weeks later Christian came downstairs like he always did to have breakfast before going to school. Only this time his sisters instead of being in their school uniforms were in their everyday clothes.</p><p>"Why aren't you in your school uniforms?" he asked as he sat down.</p><p>"We have to go on a trip today." Lia told her brother.</p><p>"Can I come?" Christian asked.</p><p>"No, you have school today." Akane said as she brought in Christians breakfast.</p><p>"But Lia an' Matoko have school too." Christian said. "Why do they get to go?"</p><p>"Where they're going to isn't open on the weekends Christian." Akane explained.</p><p>"Oh. So where are you going?" Christian asked.</p><p>"To visit my mother." Matoko said softly.</p><p>Christian gave Matoko an odd look.</p><p>"What do mean? Moms right here." he said.</p><p>Matoko sighed and looked at her brother.</p><p>"My biological mother Christian." she said. "I'm adopted, remember?"</p><p>"Oh, yeah, that's right." Christian said. "So why are you visiting her?"</p><p>"I'll tell you when you're older." Matoko said.</p><p>"Okay." Christian said as he turned to his attention to pressing matters, like breakfast. "Ooh, leftovers."</p><p>Both girls smiled at Christians expression as Ranma walked into the room.</p><p>"I'm changed." she said. "You girls ready?"</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said as her sister nodded.</p><p>"Lets go then. We don't want to miss the train." Ranma said. "We got a long ride ahead of us."</p><p>Christian watched as his sisters and father walked out of the living room into the hall. Hearing the door to the mud room close he looked at his mother.</p><p>"Mom, Matokos adopted?" he asked.</p><p>Akane blinked and looked at her son in surprise.</p><p>"Yes Christian, she is." she said. "Didn't anyone tell you that?" she asked</p><p>"No." Christian said as he shook his head. "Is that why she's taller than Dad and has brown hair?"</p><p>"Something like that." Akane said with a chuckle.</p><p>"Okay." Christian said with a shrug. "When was she adopted?"</p><p>"When you were four. Don't you remember her coming to live with us?" Akane asked.</p><p>Christian shook his head. "No. I cant remember back that far." he said. "She's always been there."</p><p>"Does her being adopted change anything?" Akane asked.</p><p>"No. She's always been my sister." Christian said with an eight -year -olds certainty.</p><p>Akane chuckled as she headed back into the kitchen. "Well, I'm glad that's settled." she said.</p><p>It took the trio of Saotomes over an hour to reach their stop. During the trip all three were silent, each lost in their own thoughts. For Matoko, it was a chance to reflect on the life she had left behind four years ago.</p><p>Lia thought about how her best friend had became her sister, and how they were now inseparable.</p><p>Ranma only hoped that she had been raising Matoko right.</p><p>"Rano(2) Station. The next stop is Rano Station. Repeat, the next stop is Rano Station."</p><p>Ranma looked up at the PA announcement and nudged Matoko, who was sitting next to her.</p><p>"That's our stop." she said.</p><p>Together the three of them stood up as the train came to a stop. Pushing forward they made their way through the crowd to the train doors onto the platform. Standing on their platform Ranma got her bearings and led them from the platform to the street.</p><p>Hailing a cab the three of them piled into the back seat.</p><p>"Where to ladies?" the cabdriver asked.</p><p>Ranma and Lia bristled at being called 'ladies', but kept their opinions to themselves.</p><p>"Arishima Care Facility." Ranma said.</p><p>"Yes Ma'am." the cabdriver said, putting the cab into gear.</p><p>Ten minutes later they were deposited in front of the state -owned home. Walking up to the gate Ranma pressed the buzzer.</p><p>"Yes?" a woman's voice answered.</p><p>"We have an appointment scheduled. Under the name Saotome." Ranma said into the speaker.</p><p>"One moment." the woman said.</p><p>A few seconds later a buzzer sounded and the gate slid open. Walking through the trio approached the building and entered the door marked 'administration'. Inside the waiting room the only occupant was a woman seated at a desk.</p><p>"I've paged Dr. Satoshi. He should be here in a few minutes." the woman said.</p><p>"Thank you." Ranma said with a bow.</p><p>The three of them sat down and waited for Dr. Satoshi. As they waited Lia could feel the eyes of the receptionist on her, but when she glanced up the receptionist was looking in the other direction.</p><p>Lia had become used to situations like this happening and so had worked out a routine. Waiting until she was sure the receptionist was looking at her Lia twitched her ears and let her unwind from around her waist.</p><p>Hearing the receptionist 'eep' Lias looked up, feigning surprise.</p><p>"You-you- you've got a <i>tail!" </i>the receptionist squeaked.</p><p>Lia looked down at the waist and blinked. Grabbing her tail Lia gave the receptionist a sheepish grin.</p><p>"Sorry. It has a mind of it's own sometimes." she said.</p><p>"How-?" The receptionist asked.</p><p>"It's a curse I picked up." Lia explained.</p><p>"Oh. Sorry." the receptionist said a s a slight blush spread across her cheeks.</p><p>"Don't feel bad. I get asked about it a lot." Lia said with a embarrassed chuckle. "I've found it to be a great conversation starter."</p><p>"I see." the receptionist said as she suddenly found something else to do.</p><p>Lia looked away, face saved and curiosity satisfied. Feeling some what out of sorts Lia closed her eyes and began to meditate.</p><p>Lias meditation was interupted a few minutes later by the arrival of Dr. Satoshi. Coming in he walked over to the trio of Saotomes and bowed.</p><p>"My apologies. I would have been here sooner but I had to deal with one of my patients." he said.</p><p>"No apologies necessary Doctor." Ranma said as they stood up. "If you don't mind?" she asked.</p><p>"Not at all. This way." the doctor said as he turned to the door.</p><p>As they walked down a long white hallway Matoko cleared her throat.</p><p>"Doctor..." she asked. "How is my mother?"</p><p>Dr. Satoshi sighed and looked at his clipboard before responding.</p><p>"There's been no change I'm afraid." he said. "Your mothers condition has remained the same."</p><p>Matoko nodded."Is she well? You said the last time I called she was coughing."she asked.</p><p>"Oh." Dr. Satoshi said with a nod. "Your mother caught a bug brought in by one of our nurses. It was nothing serious. Just a variant of the common cold."</p><p>"Oh." Matoko said.</p><p>Reaching a door marked 'recreational area' Dr. Satoshi stopped and held up his hand. Turning he faced the three Saotomes.</p><p>"Now before we go in Lias I must ask you remove you're costume ears." he said. "I'm afraid they would be disruptive."</p><p>"Huh? Oh." Lia said as she twitched her ears. "They're not part of a costume Doctor."</p><p>Dr. Satoshi watched with intense curiosity as Lias waggled both her ears and unwound her tail from her waist.</p><p>"They real." Lias explained.</p><p>"I see. And how did you manage to get them-"he began before Ranma interupted.</p><p>"It's part of a curse she picked up." Ranma said. "It's a family tradition."</p><p>"Oh." Dr. Satoshi said as Lias pulled a thermos from her bag. Unscrewing the lid she dribbled a little warm water onto herself and instantly her ears and tail disappeared.</p><p>"How's that?" she asked.</p><p>"That's better." Dr. Satoshi said as he opened the door.</p><p>Opening the door they entered the room. It was furnished with tables and chairs, which were occupied by adults of various ages. It was painted white with yellow trim, and that combined with the large windows gave the room a bright cheerful feeling.</p><p>Matokos mother was seated in the back, near the windows. She was dressed in the hospital pajamas and her hair had been braided. Approaching the table Matoko saw that her mother was drawing with crayons.</p><p>"Kosoru...Kosoru, it's me, Matoko." she said as she approached her mother.</p><p>"Toko-chan!" Her mother exclaimed with a smile. "You came to visit me"</p><p>Matoko smiled as she sat down. "Yes Kosoru, I did." she said. "And I brought you something."</p><p>"What is it?" Kosoru asked. "Is it candy?"</p><p>"No...but it's something you'd like." Matoko said as she opened her bag.</p><p>Reaching inside she pulled out an oversized box of crayons, with every hue in the rainbow available. Putting it on the table she slid it over to her mother.</p><p>"Crayons!" Kosoru exclaimed as she opened the box.</p><p>Matoko watched as her mother began to draw on a fresh sheet of paper. Green became grass and trees, brown the trunks. Blue was used to make the sky and yellow was the sun. Black lines became buildings and cars. A playground was added, then the children playing there.</p><p>"So, what are you drawing?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"The park!" Kosoru exclaimed.</p><p>Several hours later the three of them returned home to the Saotome household.</p><p>"We're home!" Lias announced as they stepped out of the mud room.</p><p>"Welcome back!" Akane called. "Nodokas here and she made dinner!"</p><p>"Thank you Mom." Ranma said as she walked down the hall.</p><p>"Oh, it was nothing." Nodoka said as they entered the main room. "Christian, Mamimi, sit down!"</p><p>Puzzled by her mothers last comment Ranma headed down the hall to the main room to find a worn out panda seated at the table along with Christian in her cursed form with Mamimi, both dressed in kimonos.</p><p>"Uh, Mom, what's going on?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh, I'm teaching them how to behave like proper young ladies." Nodoka said.</p><p>Ranma blinked as she looked at her mother. "Mom, Christian is a <i>boy." </i>she said.</p><p>"I know. And you're doing a wonderful job of raising him." she said. "But with the kind of situations members of this family end up in, I thought it would be a wise idea to train her on how to use her female side."</p><p>"Oh. I see." Ranma said. "How are you doing?" she asked Christian.</p><p>Christian nodded slightly. "I'm fine." she said. "But this kimono is hot and itchy."</p><p>"Now you know how I felt." Lias said as she and Matoko entered the room.</p><p>"Hello girls." Nodoka said as she looked up. "How was your trip?"</p><p>"It was fine." Lias said.</p><p>"I made dinner for you, if you wish to eat." Nodoka offered.</p><p>"Thank you Nodoka, but I'm really tired and I just want to go to bed." Matoko said in a tired voice. "Excuse me."</p><p>Lias watched her sister head to the stairs and bowed to Nodoka.</p><p>"Me too grandma. That train ride tired me out." she said before heading to the stairs.</p><p>Nodoka watched Lias leave before looking at Ranma.</p><p>"Is everything okay?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Ranma said as she sat down at the table. "Today brought back some old memories, that's all."</p><p>Nodoka nodded as Ranma turned on the TV.</p><p>"<i>The forecast for this evening is for a warm front to come through in the early morning hours. There is a strong chance for thunderstorms, starting at midnight and continuing through till morning." </i>the weatherman's voice said as the picture came up.</p><p>"Thought so." Ranma said. "I've been feeling it all day."</p><p>Violet-white light blazed through the screens, illuminating the room before a thunderclap split the heavens and shook the house to its very foundations.</p><p>Lias shrieked at the noise and buried her face in Kasumis bosom. Trembling with fear Lias hugged her aunt as she stroked the back of her head.</p><p>"Don't worry Lias. They'll be fine." Kasumi said gently.</p><p>All Lias could do was sniffle and hold on tight to her aunt.</p><p>"<i>Aunt Kasumi?"</i></p><p>Lias eyes snapped open as she bolted upright into the sitting position. Sitting on her futon she heard the triphammer of her heart in her ears. Breathing hard Lias realized she was in her room, and she wasn't a kid.</p><p>"It was a dream." she whispered to herself.</p><p>A sudden flash of lightning illuminated her bedroom through her drapes, followed by a loud <i>bang </i>of thunder.</p><p>"EEK!" Lias screeched as she dove under the covers.</p><p>A few moments later Lias came out from under the covers feeling very foolish. Throwing back the covers she stood up and walked to her door. Sliding open the door Lias padded down the hall to the master bedroom and slid the door open a crack.</p><p>Peeking through the door with her Neko -ken and curse enhanced (3) vision Lias saw that her parents were sound asleep in bed. Sliding the door shut with a sigh of relief Lias stood in the hall for a few moments with her head leaning against the door frame.</p><p>"<i>There's no way I'm going to be able to get back to sleep now." </i>she thought. <i>"I think I'll go make some warm milk." </i></p><p>Standing up straight Lias turned and began to walk towards the stairs.</p><p>"I hate thunderstorms." she muttered as lightning flashed.</p><p>"Momma?"</p><p>Matoko opened her eyes and sat up in bed. Rubbing her eyes she looked around until she saw the alarm clock, which read 12:20 AM.</p><p>"Momma?" she asked again.</p><p>Looking to her left Matoko saw that her mothers futon wasn't rolled out. Scratching her head in puzzlement Matoko wondered where her mother could be. It wasn't like her to not come home after she got off work.</p><p>It was only when she looked behind her that Matoko realized that the bathroom light was on. Getting up she stepped over to the door and opened it, revealing her mother sprawled in the bathtub with her clothes on.</p><p>As she stepped into the bathroom her foot bumped into a cold, hard, object. Looking down she saw it was a empty bottle. Curious as to why her mother started drinking Matoko reached over and shook her shoulder.</p><p>When she didn't respond Matoko shook harder, with no effect. Concerned now she gave her mother an even harder shake, whacked caused her head to loll to one side.</p><p>That's when she saw her mothers eyes, which were open and unblinking.</p><p>"Momma? Wake up!" Matoko said as she grabbed her mothers shoulders and began to shake her hard.</p><p>"Momma!"</p><p>Matoko sat in the darkness of her room as thunder rolled across the sky. The only sounds were the pounding of raindrops on the roof and her heart. Swallowing she realized her throat was parched and she needed a drink of water.</p><p>Shaking her head Matoko got up and went downstairs.</p><p>Christians eyes fluttered open as light came through her bed room window. Throwing back the covers she sat up and looked around her room.</p><p>"What the?" she mumbled as she looked at the rooms decor.</p><p>The room was decorated as a girls room, with pastel tones and stuffed animals throughout. On the walls were posters of boy bands and anime characters. Gone form the shelves were Christians action figures and mangas, replaced by more stuffed animals and shoju(4) manga.</p><p>Flipping the strap of her nightgown up onto her shoulder Christian froze, and slowly looked down at herself. Her eyes went to the size of dinner plates as she saw that she was dressed in a white cotton nightgown.</p><p>"What's going on?" she whispered. "Why am I dressed as a girl?"</p><p>Getting up she headed straight to her parents room. Sliding the door open she entered her parents room and padded over to their futon. Kneeling down she gently shook her mothers shoulder.</p><p>"Mom, mom, wake up." she whispered.</p><p>Akane stirred and rolled over to face her daughter.</p><p>"Nnnh... what is it Christian?" she asked.</p><p>"Why am I in a nightgown? Why is my room done up like a girls room?" Christian asked.</p><p>"Because you are a girl sweetie. Now go back to bed." Akane said as she rolled over.</p><p>"GYAAAH!"</p><p>Christians eyes snapped open as thunder rumbled overhead and lightning flashed through the windows. Lying on her futon Christian listened to her breathing as rain pounded on the roof. As she lay there Christian became aware of a wet feeling all around her.</p><p>Sitting up she began to pat the area around her on her futon, confirming that it was soaked through.</p><p>"<i>Oh no...please tell me I didn't"</i> she thought as a large drop of water dripped from the ceiling and landed on her head.</p><p>Throwing back the covers Christian stood up and carefully stepped over Mamimi, who was curled up on her futon next to his. Quietly he slid the door open and stepped into the hall as Matoko was coming down the hall.</p><p>"Hi Christian." Matoko whispered as Christian slid her door shut. "Did the storm wake you?"</p><p>Christian shook her head in the darkness. "No. The roof sprung a leak over my bed." she said. "What about you?"</p><p>"I needed a drink of water." Matoko answered.</p><p>"Well I need a drink of water too." Christian said. "And some hot water too." she added as she looked down at herself.</p><p>"Okay." Matoko said with a nod.</p><p>Downstairs they were both surprised to find Lias already sitting at the table with a snack and a glass of milk.</p><p>"Did you have the dream again Lias?" Matoko asked as she headed to the kitchen.</p><p>"Yeah." Lias said with a nod. "How about you?"</p><p>"I dreamed about Momma." Matoko said.</p><p>"And how about you. Christian?" Lias asked as she looked at her sometimes -sister and her wet clothes. "You have an accident?"</p><p>"No. There's a leak over my bed." Christian answered.</p><p>Lias looked at Christian and read her body language and knew there was more to it than just a leaky roof.</p><p>"That's not all, is it?" she asked.</p><p>Christian looked down at the floor and played with the tatami with her foot.</p><p>"No. I had a dream." she said.</p><p>"Do you want to talk about it?" Lias asked.</p><p>"Only if you talk about yours." Christian said.</p><p>"Okay." Lias said. "Why don't you sit down?"</p><p>As Christian sat down Matoko came in with three glasses and sat down with them.</p><p>"Here's your water Christian." Matoko said. "The blue glass is the hot water."</p><p>"Thank you Matoko." Christian said before dunking her fingers into the blue glass.</p><p>"Your welcome Christian." Matoko answered. "And I'll talk about my dream too. There shouldn't be secrets in families."</p><p>Christian and Lias nodded in agreement.</p><p>"But I want what we say to stay in the family." Matoko added. "Nothing should be told to someone outside the family."</p><p>"Agreed." Lias said as Christian nodded. "I'll go first, since I brought it up."</p><p>Sipping her milk Lias composed her thoughts before speaking.</p><p>"You guys remember that crazy Chinese lady a few months ago, named Shampoo?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Christian said. "I remember her. She was freaked out about me an' you for some reason."</p><p>Lias nodded as she remembered. "Thats because I mauled her when I was eight." she said. "She tried to kidnap me, but stepped on Thors tail and woke me up."</p><p>"She tried to <i>kidnap </i>you?" Matoko asked, incredulously.</p><p>Lias nodded. "Uh -huh. She had been after Dad for years to force him to marry her, and she was going to try to use me to do that."</p><p>"Sounds like a soap opera." Christian commented.</p><p>"It was. Dad and Mom decided to put an end to it and so they attacked Shampoos grandma." Lias continued. "When they did it there was a big thunderstorm like the one were having now."</p><p>The three of paused to listen as thunder rumbled and rattled the house. Sipping her milk Lias paused before she continued.</p><p>"They set out at sunset right before the storm hit and didn't come back until dawn, shortly after the storm was over." Lias said. "I spent the night huddled on Aunt Kasumis lap."</p><p>Matoko and Lias were silent as what Lias had said sank in. Finally Christian spoke up.</p><p>"So that's why you don't like thunderstorms." Christian said as Lias nodded.</p><p>Matoko looked down at her glass before she spoke.</p><p>"I- I had a dream about my mother." she said. "It was from four years ago."</p><p>"What happened?" Christian asked.</p><p>Matoko took several moments to steel herself before she responded.</p><p>"She tried to commit suicide." she said, her voice nearly breaking. "I woke up in the middle of the night and found her in the bathtub."</p><p>"So that's why you're our sister?" Christian asked.</p><p>'Yes. That's why." Matoko answered with a nod. "My mother hurt herself badly, and she has to be cared for now. She is living in a special home run by the government."</p><p>"Oh." Christian said. "So that trip you guys made...was to your-?"</p><p>"Yes." Matoko answered.</p><p>"I'm sorry." Christian said.</p><p>"For what?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"For bugging you this morning." he answered.</p><p>"It's okay." Matoko said as she patted her brother on the shoulder. "You didn't know."</p><p>Christian nodded and drained his water.</p><p>"My turn." he said.</p><p>"So, what was your dream about?" Lias asked.</p><p>Christian swallowed before speaking.</p><p>"I dreamed I was girl." Christian said.</p><p>"But you turn into a girl." Lias pointed out.</p><p>"I mean permanently." Christian explained. "I was wearing a nightgown and my room was decorated like a girls room."</p><p>Christian scowled and clenched his glass.</p><p>"I may turn into a girl, but I don't want to become one." he said.</p><p>Lias nodded in agreement as she finished her snack.</p><p>"Well lets go to bed. We have school tomorrow." she said as she stood up.</p><p>"Lias, would you mind if I moved my futon into your room?" Matoko asked quietly. "I don't want to be in my room tonight."</p><p>"Okay." Lias said with a nod. "You too Christian. You're room has a leak. You can sleep in my room."</p><p>"What about Mi-chan?" Christian asked.</p><p>"I'll take care of her. She sleeps like you dad." Lias said as she walked into the kitchen. "World War Three could erupt around her and she wouldn't wake up."</p><p>"Okay." Christian said. "Matoko, could you help me get the spare futon?"</p><p>"Certainly." Matoko said as they headed to the stairs.</p><p>When morning dawned Ranma found Christian and Matoko rooms empty, and them in Lias room. Christian and Mamimi were lying sprawled in a tangled heap, dead to the world. Lias was lying against her sister, with her arm thrown over protectively.</p><p>Ranma had a pretty good idea why they were all sleeping in the same room. The thunderstorm form the night before and their visit to Matokos mother were obvious reasons why the two girls were in there, and the water damage to the ceiling in Christians room was another.</p><p>Seeing them sleeping peacefully Ranma couldn't bear to wake them and quietly slid the door closed. Turning he saw Akane walking down the hall from the master bedroom.</p><p>"Hey Akane, I think we should let the kids stay home today." he said.</p><p>"Why?" Akane asked.</p><p>"They had rough night." Ranma answered. "They are sleeping in Lias room."</p><p>"Oh. Well, it's Saturday. Today is a half day anyways." Akane said. "And you're right. Yesterday was kind of 'heavy', plus the thunderstorm."</p><p>Nodding in agreement Ranma walked with Akane down the hall.</p><p>(1) Pronounced 'Ray-no' It's what I hope is the correct English spelling of a train station name I've heard of in Japan.</p><p>(2)Mamimi was there because Christian was there. And because truth be told Ranma felt uncomfortable with her living alone in a empty house.</p><p>(3) The effects of Lias mixed are more than just cosmetic. It makes the effects of the Neko -ken Improved that much stronger.</p><p>(4)Girls manga. Mainly romance stories. Sailor Moon is a classic example. (Don't ask how I know.)</p>
