</div><p>1Ranma Onehalf: First Steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter Five.</p><p>The slight scape of metal from a pot on the stove was what finally roused Evans from unconsciousness. Clamping his eyes shut he groaned slightly and covered his head with a pillow.</p><p>"<i>Would whoever is cooking please do it a little more quietly?" </i>he thought. <i>""Theres a man with a hangover here -waitaminute." </i></p><p>Cracking open one eye Evans lifted the pillow up enough to see who was making all the noise, and was surprised to see Bre standing at the stove.</p><p>Catching movement out of the corner of her eye Bre glanced over at Evans, who was giving her the Hangover Death Glare.</p><p>"Good morning." she said.</p><p>Getting a zombie -like groan in reply Bre smiled and went back to the stove.</p><p>"I made coffee." she said.</p><p>Evans groaned again and with careful deliberation sat up in bed. Wincing from the morning light he sat there for a few moments before shuffling over to where the coffeepot was.</p><p>As he began to feel around for a mug Bre smiled and took one down from the shelf. Grabbing Evans wrist she pressed it into his hand.</p><p>"Here you go." she said.</p><p>'Thanks." Evans said as he grabbed the coffeepot.</p><p>Sitting down at the table Evans sipped his coffee. Wincing he looked at Bre as she began to dish up breakfast.</p><p>"How come you're so chipper?" he asked. "You drank as much as I did."</p><p>"Oh, members of the Sano family are immune from hangovers." Bre answered. "It's hereditary.'</p><p>Evans scowled and rubbed his forehead. "That is just so wrong." he growled.</p><p>"I know." Bre said.</p><p>Rubbing his forehead Evans sighed and rubbed his forehead.</p><p>"Boy, does this bring back memories of home." he said.</p><p>"It does?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yeah. Sitting at the kitchen table with a hangover." Evans replied. "The only thing missing is my mom giving me the third degree."</p><p>Chuckling Bre sipped her coffee as she slid Evans plate closer to him.</p><p>"Here, eat up." she said. "You sound like you had an interesting home life."</p><p>Picking up some hash browns Evans nibbled on them as he nodded.</p><p>"Something like that." he said. "I try to think I had a pretty normal one. You know, go to school, party with my friends, play football, etc."</p><p>"This was in New York?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yeah. On the reservation." Evans said.</p><p>"So whats it like? On the reservation?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Pretty normal." Evans answered. "We have a casino, so theres jobs and money, plus a bunch of other stuff."</p><p>"So you grew up the usual split -level ranch with a sport -ute in the driveway?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Nope." Evans replied. "A huge old farmhouse, with a couple of acres of woods out back."</p><p>"Sounds like a fun place."</p><p>"It was. Part of a little hamlet." Evans continued. "My dad's an iron walker(1), my mom is a teacher."</p><p>"Any brothers or sisters?" Bre asked.</p><p>"I've got four older brothers." Evans said. Getting up he walked over to a shelf. "I got a picture around here somewhere... here we go."</p><p>Taking a picture down he walked back over to the table. Sitting down he showed the picture to Bre. It showed a younger Evans of about nineteen or so, in dress uniform with members of his family around him.</p><p>"This was taken after I got out of Basic." Evans said. "Thats my mom and dad in the back, with Jimmy- he's the oldest- and next to him is Jerry."</p><p>Bre saw a older man and woman, both obviously Native American and looking to be in their mid forties. Next to them were two men, one in his early thirties and the other in his late twenties.</p><p>"Behind me is the Terrible Twosome, Nick and Rick." Evans added, pointing to the two men standing behind him.</p><p>"Twins?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yep." Evans said with a nod. "And they're a force of nature."</p><p>Bre chuckled as she looked at the picture.</p><p>"Nice family." she said.</p><p>"That they are." Evans said. "How about your family?"</p><p>Bre blinked and thought for a second before looking up at Evans.</p><p>'Well, I was adopted when I was a baby.' she said. "To a family in Iowa. I grew up in Hudson- thats near where Lia was born- with a whole bunch of friends and cousins."</p><p>'So why are you here?"</p><p>"My parents." Bre said. "They died. Car crash."</p><p>"Oh." Evans said with a nod.</p><p>"When the will was read it turns out they wanted me to come back to Japan so I could finish my education with my birth family.' she said.</p><p>"That must have been a shock." Evans said.</p><p>"Tell me about it." Bre said. "All of a sudden I discover I have a little brother, who ain't so little."</p><p>"Thats an understatement." Naota said. "You and him get along pretty good though."</p><p>"He's a pretty good guy." Bre said. "Though some things are taking a little getting used to."</p><p>'like what?" Evans asked.</p><p>Bre sighed and looked at her hands for a moment. "His being a ninja for one." she said. "And his being a cat demon for another."</p><p>"That took me by surprise, when that happened." Evans said. "The ticking of my watch drove him crazy."</p><p>"Yeah, his hearing." Bre said. "And theres his being pissed at our father."</p><p>"Well, its not like he dosent have a good reason..." pointed out Evans.</p><p>"Yeah, but Dokuohtei told me that Naota has the Sano temper." said Bre.</p><p>"Bad, huh?"</p><p>"It makes the Israelites and Palestinians look forgiving." Bre said, her mouth quirking into a smile. "I always wondered where I got it from."</p><p>"So he's ticked at you guy's father." Evans said.</p><p>"Something like that." Bre said. "I wasn't really concerned with that at first, but now that I've decided to stay..."</p><p>"You were gonna leave?" Evans asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Bre answered. "I was going to finish my education then head back to the States, but I found a reason to stick around."</p><p>"Ah." Evans said with a nod, a sudden wave of nausea preventing him from pursuing the question. "And now?" he asked once the nausea had passed.</p><p>"And now in the future you know thats going to make thing awkward." Bre answered.</p><p>"Oh, don't worry." Evans said. "They'll make up."</p><p>"How do you know that?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Lia. Naotas getting married to her, remember?" said Evans. "She won't stand that happening between them. She'll get them to see the error of their ways, even if she has to mallet the both of them into next week."</p><p>"Oh, yeah, thats right. I forgot about that." Bre said. "I wonder how she does that? I'll have to ask her."</p><p></p><p>The lure flashed in the sun as it traveled in an arc, overshooting target and landing with a chime of metal meeting wood. Carefully Ranma began his retrieve, slowly working his line in and twitching his lure.</p><p>It was opening day, but his quarry was wise and wily, with many seasons behind it. This was a game of patience and timing.</p><p>Lia was sitting at the table reading a magazine when her sensitive ears picked up the lure whizzing through the air before impacting on the deck. She started to get up to take a look but stopped, sitting back down and shaking her head.</p><p>"<i>No. I'm not six anymore." </i>she thought. <i>"And I'm not going to bite." </i></p><p>Going back to her magazine Lia ignored the sound of the lure scraping the wood of the deck as her father retrieved it. She was doing fairly well until a flash in the corner of her eye caught her attention.</p><p>The flash was the sunlight reflecting off of the lure. Jerking her gaze away Lia tried not to think about it but ultimately it was a futileeffort. Dropping her magazine Lia pounced after the lure, only to have it jump away at the last instant.</p><p>"Nyaow?" Lia said when she opened her hands to find them empty.</p><p>Hearing the scrape and jingle of metal on wood she looked up to see the lure sitting a half -meter away. Narrowing her eyes Lia tensed and prepared to strike, her tail waving back and forth in the air.</p><p>Springing forwards Lia pounced, only to have it skitter out of her grasp. She pounced again, only to have it skitter a few centimeters away.</p><p>Holding perfectly still Lia stared a the lure for several second before reaching out to bat at it experimentally. When it didn't skitter away this time she tried to grab it, but to no avail as it again skittered away.</p><p>Instantly Lia was up and chasing the lure down the length of the patio and out into the yard, finally stopping at Ranmas feet.</p><p>"So what exactly is it are you doing again?" Bre asked as she watched Lia bat at the lure as Ranma held it aloft.</p><p>"Fishing for Lias." answered Ranma.</p><p>"Uh-huh. Right." Bre said. "You know I'd point out how weird that sounds, but after being in Nerima..."</p><p>"I know." Ranma said as he watched his daughter bat at the lure.</p><p>"So how <i>did </i>this start?" Bre asked.</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "I was playing with Thor one day when Lia was six and she joined in." he said. "It's the Neko -Ken Improved."</p><p>"Okaaaay." Bre said. "And I suppose she goes loopy on catnip too, right?"</p><p>"Loopy' is an understatement." Ranma said. "She goes into full 'Kitten' mode."</p><p>"Huh." Lia said. "I wonder if my baby bro is affected?'</p><p></p><p>"AH -CHOO -crap, not again!"</p><p>"0\/\/nz3d!"</p><p></p><p>"I'd be surprised if it didn't." answered Ranma.</p><p>'I'll have to try it out on him, and see what happenes..." Bre mused to herself. "Anyways, wheres Akane?"</p><p>"Fabric shop." Ranma said. "Shopping for Christian and Mamimis school clothes."</p><p>"Well then, I'm in for a wait." Bre said.</p><p>"Pull up a chair." offered Ranma. "The Lias are biting."</p><p></p><p>Naota stopped dead in his run down the corridor's, a sudden feeling of impending doom overtaking him. Which was then proved partly correct by a shotgun blast to the chest.</p><p>'I got the Chink -Chink! I got the Chink -Chink!(2)" Eichiro crowed before his triumph was cut off by a grenade to the face.</p><p>'p4/ 4773n710n n00b." Kenji said before turning his fatal attention to a self -proclaimed 'King of Halo'. "D13!"</p><p>Deciding that he had enough Halo for one day Naota decided to leave the fight. Putting down his controller he got up and walked over to his guitar.</p><p>"Hey Naota, why did you drop out?" Eichiro asked after he got fragged.</p><p>"Decided we needed some music." answered Naota as his amp warmed up(3).</p><p>"Cool." Eichiro said as he respawned. "CHINK -CHINK!"</p><p>Chuckling at Eichiros focus on his favorite weapon Naota plugged his Strat into his amp and flexed the claw on his forefinger, giving him an effective guitar pick.</p><p>"<i>Thats one good thing about being a cat demon." </i>he thought. <i>"I'm not losing my picks anymore." </i></p><p>Plucking at the strings a few times to make sure it was in tune he launched into the opening chords of a song he had been working on. As he went deeper into the song he began to improvise, playing around with the chords and variations on the theme.</p><p>By the time the match ended Naota was on a roll, and the rest of the players on the server were demanding the removal of "H3 \/\/h0 0\/\/nz". Putting down his controller Kenji got up and walked to the door.</p><p>"I'm gonna head down to the store and pick up that stuff I was needing." Kenji said as he slipped his shoes on.</p><p>"Get me a six -pack a Sapporo while you're out." Naota said as he strummed.</p><p>"Ha, ha, ha." Kenji shot back as he stepped out. "You're a laugh riot."</p><p>As Eichiro sank deeper into Naota continued to play until he realized that he was thirsty. Toning down his strumming he glanced over at Eichiro.</p><p>"Yo, you want a soda?" he asked.</p><p>Getting a nod in response Naota quit playing and set his Strat in its case before getting up and walking to the fridge. Only to discover that they were out of soda.</p><p>"What the- That was a fresh thirty pack!" was Naotas reaction on seeing the empty space in the fridge.</p><p>"Did Kenji guzzle all the soda again?" Eichiro asked as he waited to respawn.</p><p>"What do you think?" Naota asked as he shut the door to the refrigerator. "How does he <i>do </i>that anyways?"</p><p>"I do not know." Eichiro answered.</p><p>"Well, I gotta make a resupply run." Naota said as he walked to the door. "Hold down the fort."</p><p>"What about Hideo?" Eichiro asked as before Naotas cell rang.</p><p>"Thats probably him now." Naota said as he looked at the display. "It is."</p><p>Pressing the talk button Naota put it to his ear.</p><p>"Yo." he said.</p><p>"Naota, can I ask a favor of you?" Hideo said as he came on the line. "I need to hide out at your place for a few hours."</p><p>"What did you do?" Naota asked suspiciously.</p><p>"Ah...nothing?" Hideo answered.</p><p>"Uh -huh. Yeah, right." Naota relied. "The last time you said that I had a mob with torches at my door."</p><p>"It's not a mob!" protested Hideo. "It's just Mitsuko!"</p><p>"Thats just as bad!" Naota shot back. "Your cousin's a one girl army!"</p><p>"Please?"</p><p>"Okay." Naota said. "But get me a thirty pack of soda. Kenji got hold of the case in the fridge."</p><p>"Okay. See you in a few." Hideo said before he hung up.</p><p>Putting his cell away Naota walked back to his guitar and sat down, Picking it up he flexed the claw on his forefinger again, but paused when an idea flashed in his brain.</p><p>"<i>Why not?" </i>he thought.</p><p>Unsheathing the rest of his claws Naota began to play, starting off with some basic chords. After running through them a few times to 'get the hang of it' he launched into one of his favorite songs, one that he had written when he was fifteen and knew like the back of his hand.</p><p>The result was noticeably different compared to how he usually played. To Naota it sounded much less tighter and much more alive than how he had played before. He had always known that he could play the guitar and play it well; now he knew what he could really do with it.</p><p>"Dude, is that a new song?" asked Echiro as he paused his game.</p><p>"No, it's just <i>In the Shadows.</i>" Naota answered as he played. "I'm just playing it different."</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"I'm finger picking with my whole hand." answered Naota as he finished. "And Hideos here."</p><p>"Interesting." Echiro said as Naota got up. "And how do you know he's here?"</p><p>"How else?" Naota asked. "My m4d n1nj4 sk1llz."</p><p>"Duh. How could I forget?" Echiro said as he went back to his game.</p><p>'I've told you a million times before Echiro: Halo rots the brain." Naota said as he opened the door.</p><p>"HALO IS LIFE!" Echiro yelled as Hideo stepped in, lugging a thirty pack of soda and a backpack.</p><p>"Oh, I see I'm in time for the weekly Halo v Quake argument." Hideo said as he dropped his pack.</p><p>"Yep!" Naota and Echiro chorused.</p><p>Spotting the bag Naota looked at it and narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "And whatever perverted stuff you have in that bag had better stay in there Hideo.'</p><p>"It will, don't worry." Hideo said as he put the soda away.</p><p>"It had better." Naota said. "Cause if I get malleted because of you there will be hell to pay."</p><p>"I know, I know." Hideo said answered as he dug a soda out. Tossing one to Naota and another to Echiro he walked over to the table. "So is it okay if I work here?" he asked.</p><p>"Yeah. Just clean up afterwards." Naota answered as he picked up his guitar. "And when you're done I want you to take a look at my amp. I think a tubes(4) gonna go again."</p><p>"I don't know why you use that relic." Hideo said as he unzipped his bag.</p><p>"Whats wrong with my guitar?" Naota asked, shielding it in a protective embrace.</p><p>"Nothing." Hideo said. "I was referring to that museum piece you call an amp."</p><p>'Oh, Thats easy." Naota said while he sat down. "Best sound, you know that."</p><p>"Dude, I could build you a analogue amp that sounds just as good with a fraction of the maintaince than that one needs." Hideo said, pointing to the subject in question. "You know there's this amazing step forwards in technology called a <i>transistor</i>."</p><p>"Okay then. Put your money where your mouth is." Naota said as he plucked at a couple of strings. "Build it."</p><p>Hideo paused in unloading his tools to look at Naota. "You're on." he said. "But if I pull it off you have to back me up against Kenji for a year."</p><p>"Deal." Naota said. "But if you don't you have to fix my amp with no griping for a year."</p><p>"Deal." Hideo said. "I'll beat Kenji at Quake yet."</p><p>"HALO IS LIFE!"</p><p>"Yeah, yeah." Hideo grumbled as he started to arrange his tools. "We heard you the first time."</p><p>"And speaking of life, shouldn't you be walking your little sister home?" Naota asked Echiro as he looked at the clock.</p><p>"Huh- Oh <i>shit!</i>" Echiro said when he saw the time. "Moms gonna murder me! Thanksforthesodabye!"</p><p>Naotawatched Echiros sudden departure with amusement while Hideo protectively covered his tools .</p><p>"Well, he's a dead man." Hideo said as he got up.</p><p>"Yep." agreed Naota as he played a chord that had been rattling around in his brain.</p><p>Standing in front of Naotas computer Hideo considered the set up and how many pairs of hands he would need. Deciding he was two short he turned around to face Naota.</p><p>"Hey, demon -boy. Gimme a hand?" he asked.</p><p>"Huh?" Naota asked as he looked up. "Okay."</p><p>Putting his guitar down again Naota got up and walked over to where Hideo was.</p><p>"So what do you need?" he asked.</p><p>"Just keep stuff from getting knocked over while I disconnect your box from the peripherals." Hideo said as he reached around the back. "I'm doing it by Braille, remember."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said as he grabbed a pile of CDs.</p><p>As Hideo worked at disconnected everything Naota found himself in tight quarters with Hideo. As he held onto the CDs Naota found his nose picking up all sorts of smells. The dank smell of dust, the surprisingly strong scent of plastic, the crumbs from the onion rings that he had been munching on yesterday, paper, and most strongly of all-</p><p>"<i>Fox?"</i></p><p>Taking another whiff Naota confirmed that he was smelling what he thought he was smelling. He had encountered that scent before, when he and Lia had spent the evening at Asako Kawashimas apartment.</p><p>"<i>So thats the game you were playing..." </i>thought Naota. Thinking quickly he came up with a plan. "Hey Hideo, you know a Asako Kawashima?"</p><p>"Yeah." grunted Hideo. "She's a friend of Mitsukos. What about her?"</p><p>"She's a fox." Naota said as he lifted a cable out of the way.</p><p>"No, she's not." Hideo said as he glanced up at Naota. "She's freaking <i>scorching.</i>"</p><p>"No, I mean really, she's a fox." Naota answered. "As in she's a fox -demon."</p><p>"How do you know that?" asked Hideo as the last connection came free. "There."</p><p>"She told me, duh." Naota answered. "That, and her scent."</p><p>"And how would you know what a fox -demon smells like anyways?" Hideo asked as he prepared to lift the box.</p><p>"Your scent." answered Naota casually.</p><p>"Of course, I'm a hanyou- d'oh!" Hideo said.</p><p>"Gotcha." Naota said as he crossed his arms.</p><p>"Uh- I was just kidding Naota..." Hideo said as he sweat dropped.</p><p>"Ahem." said Naota, tapping the side of his nose. "The nose knows Hideo."</p><p>"Crap." Hideo said as he ran his hand through his hair. "You're not mad, are you?"</p><p>"No." Naota said. "I hid my being a ninja from you and the guys for years, remember? Getting mad about it would be hypocritical."</p><p>"Yeah." Hideo said with a nod. "That's true." he added with a shrug.</p><p>Picking up the box Hideo carried it over to the table and set it down. Turing it around he sat down and picked up a screwdriver.</p><p>'So what do you look like?" asked Naota.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Without your foxfire." explained Naota.</p><p>"Oh." Hideo said. "Like this."</p><p>Closing his eyes Hideo sighed and blue green foxfire flared around him. It wreathed around him for a moment then died away, revealing Hideos true form.</p><p>It wasn't much different from his regular form, except he had the ears of a fox, dark red hair, and a single bushy fox tail.</p><p>"Huh." Naota said as he took in his friend's new 'look'. "I never would have guessed."</p><p>"Thats not surprising." Hideo answered. "I <i>do </i> have foxfire after all."</p><p>'So what else can you do?" asked Naota.</p><p>"Not much." answered Hideo as he started on the screws holding on the cover to the computer. "I'm the hanyou son of a one -tail so I'm pretty weak as demons go. Not like a tai -yokai like you."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said. "What does that mean by the way? That thing with the tails?"</p><p>"How strong we are." explained Hideo. "Take my dad for example. He's a one tail, so that means the low guy on the totem pole, right?"</p><p>"Right." Naota said with a nod.</p><p>" Asako is a six -tail, which puts her in the middle." continued Hideo. "At the top are the nine -tails, who's word is basically law among our kind."</p><p>"So you and your dad pretty much try to avoid getting other demons attention, right?" asked Naota.</p><p>"Pretty much." answered Hideo as he began to poke around in the guts of the computer.</p><p>Naota sat for a few minutes pondering what Hideo had said before he spoke again.</p><p>"So, you knew what I had become from the get -go, right?" he asked.</p><p>"Uh-huh." Hideo answered as he pulled a video card out of its slot. "This can get out of there... Yeah, it freaked out my dad the first time he saw you. I had to explain to him that you didn't know what you were."</p><p>"You were trying to keep him from running away." said Naota as Hideo shook his head.</p><p>"Nope." said Hideo. "I was trying to keep him from prostrating himself before you and swearing fealty to you."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said with a wince. " Sesshomaru probably wouldn't have liked that."</p><p>"No, he wouldn't have." Hideo said. "And speaking of The Lord of the Western Lands, has he contacted you yet?"</p><p>"No, not yet." Naota said as he picked up his old video card.</p><p>"Well, when he does, keep this in mind: He <i>is </i>reasonable." Hideo said as he pulled the new video card out of its box. "You can negotiate with him."</p><p>"Thanks for the advice." Naota said, dropping the old video card onto the table. "I'll keep that in mind."</p><p>"You're welcome." Hideo said as he looked around the table. "Hand me that screwdriver, would ya?" he asked, pointing to the tool in question.</p><p>"Oh, sure." Naota said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm home." Kenji said as he opened the door to the apartment. "Naota? Echiro?" he asked as he stepped in.</p><p>Answered by the silence of the empty apartment Kenji shrugged as he closed the door behind him. Walking over to his drafting table he stopped to look at Naotas comp lying gutted on the table.</p><p>Giving the components a cursory glance Kenji saw a shuriken(5) embedded in the table with a note spiked on it. Leaning over he read the note.</p><p><i>On a parts run. Be back whenever.</i></p><p><i>-Naota.</i></p><p><i>PS: Don't touch anything!</i></p><p><i>-Hideo.</i></p><p>Snorting in amusement Kenji went over to his drafting table and began to put his purchases away before wadding up the bag and tossing it into the trash. Sitting down he pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and picked up his layout pencil.</p><p>He had just put pencil to paper when there was a knock at the door. Putting down his pencil he got up and walked to the door.</p><p>"Who is it?" he asked.</p><p>"Matoko."</p><p>Kenji froze as he tried to think of what to do.</p><p>'Kenji?" asked Matoko. "Are you all right?"</p><p>"Y-y-yes." Kenji said. "H-hold on, let me unlock the door."</p><p>Opening the door Kenji stepped aside as Matoko came in, carrying a basket.</p><p>"Thank you." Matoko said. "I brought lunch." she added, hefting the basket.</p><p>"You're welcome." Kenji said. "But thats going to be a bit tricky with the table the way it is." he added, pointing to the table.</p><p>"I see..."Matoko said as she saw the table. "I think we're going to have to eat on the floor."</p><p>Kenji nodded for a second before a thought struck him.</p><p>"How about the roof?" he asked.</p><p>"The roof?" asked Matoko as Kenji nodded again.</p><p>"Yeah. Naota, me, and the rest of the guys hang up there all the time." Kenji said. "And it's perfect weather for a picnic."</p><p>"Oh, it is, isn't it?" Matoko said as she glanced out the window. "Though how do we get up there?"</p><p>"That ladder out on the porch." Kenji said, pointing to the sliding glass door at the far end of the apartment.</p><p>"I'll get the dishes." Matoko said.</p><p>Once she had obtained the necessary implements and had stepped out onto the porch Matoko realized that there was a couple of slight problems: One, she only had two hands, both of which were required to climb a ladder and something you can't do while holding a basket full of food and dishes. And more importantly, Two: It was slightly breezy and she was wearing a dress.</p><p>"Kenji?"</p><p>"Yeah?" Kenji asked, poking his head over the edge of the roof.</p><p>"I have a small problem" Matoko said. "How and I going to climb the ladder with a basket and keep my modesty?"</p><p>"Hold on." Kenji said before he disappeared from view. "Hideo whipped up a solution to getting things up here." he added.</p><p>Kenji reappeared a few moments later as a small boom made out of pipe swung out over the edge of the roof. On one end was a plastic crate with metal hoops attached to it, which bent to meet in the middle. A cable was attached to that and ran through a pulley at the end of the boom and back.</p><p>With the whir of an electric motor the basket was lowered down to Matoko.</p><p>'That's very clever." she said as it stopped in front of her. Loading the basket into the crate she waved up at Kenji. "Hoist away!" she said.</p><p>She watched as the crate was raised to the roof before very carefully climbing the ladder. Once she was on the roof Matoko was surprised to see a table made out of plywood and surrounded by several small benches made out two -by -fours.</p><p>"This is nice." she said. "I can see why you'd want to hang out here."</p><p>"It is." Kenji said as he removed the picnic basket from the crate. "The table and benches were made by Haru(6) at his dads shop."</p><p>"Ah." Matoko said as she took the basket from Kenji. "He does good work."</p><p>"He should. Hes been helping out in his dads shop since he could walk." Kenji said as they walked to the table.</p><p>"Then the trade schools must be clamoring for him then." Matoko said.</p><p>"They can clamor away." Kenji said as Matoko set the basket down and opened it. "He's joining his dad as an apprentice as soon as he graduates."</p><p>"Oh." Matoko said as she looked inside the basket. "Could you give me a hand here Kenji?"</p><p>"Sure." Kenji said as Matoko handed him a pair of napkins. "We have napkins?"</p><p>"I brought them over when you and Naota moved in, remember?" Matoko said as she pulled out a pair of thermoses. "Open them out and lay them on the table."</p><p>Kenji nodded in reply as Matoko brought out more items: A large bowl of rice, fish, tofu, and various other dishes along with plates, cups and chopsticks. Setting them out she arranged them into an aesthetically pleasing fashion before stepping back to take it all in.</p><p>"Perfect." she said. "Lets eat."</p><p>"By all means." agreed Kenji as he sat down. "So what is what?"</p><p>"Well, the large bowl is rice, and the smaller bowls are sushi, with the one in the center being soy sauce." Matoko began. Pointing to the two thermoses she continued. "The red thermos is miso soup, and the green one is tea."</p><p>"Tea first." Kenji said.</p><p>Smiling at Kenjis addition to caffeine she took the green thermos and poured themselves both a cup. Putting aside the thermos Matoko handed Kenji his cup.</p><p>"Here you go." she said.</p><p>'Thank you." Kenji said. "So how are things at the house?"</p><p>"Well..." Matoko began. "My future sister in law was curious if catnip works on cat -demons."</p><p>"And does it?" asked Kenji.</p><p>"Yes, it does." Matoko answered. "But she also discovered that it works on catgirls and those trained in the Neko -Ken Improved as well."</p><p>"That must have been interesting." Kenji said with a wince.</p><p>"Oh, it was." Matoko answered. "Fortunately Bre used regular catnip, not the stuff 1-C(7) made. When I left Ranma was curled up on Akanes lap, Christian was batting at a piece of string Mamimi had, and Lia and Naota were curled up in a patch of sun."</p><p>Kenji snorted at the mental image that conjured up as Matoko reached for the rice.</p><p>"Sounds like I missed it." he said.</p><p>"Don't worry." said Matoko as she handed Kenji his bowl. "She got it on tape."</p><p>"Cool." Kenji said. "I'll have to ask her for a copy."</p><p>Matoko chuckled as she dished herself up some rice. They continued with the small talk as they ate, enjoying the nice weather and avoiding what had been on the forefront of their minds for the past couple of weeks.</p><p>Which was why for the life of him Kenji couldn't figure out why he suggested that they go for a walk afterwards.</p><p>They had been walking for an hour when they stopped so he could get a soda.</p><p>"Ahhh...caffine."</p><p>"Just how much caffeine do you need?" asked Matoko.</p><p>"You can never have too much caffeine." Kenji answered.</p><p>"If you say so." Matoko said with a shake of her head.</p><p>"It's true!" insisted Kenji.</p><p>"So what would you do without it?" Matoko asked as she stared him right in the eye. "Hmm?"</p><p>Kenji thought about it for a few moments before he responded.</p><p>"I don't know." he said. "I suppose I wouldn't be able to function. But that's why you're here."</p><p>Matokos eyes went wide as she gaped at him.</p><p>"<i>Smooth Kenji. Real smooth." </i>Kenji heard the voice of his father berate him in thee back of his mind. <i>"You had to screw up the good time you were having by jamming your foot in your mouth, as usual." </i>it said as he watched Matokos lower lip start to tremble.</p><p>"<i>Well say something doofus." </i>the voice screamed at him. <i>"Prove that you're not a total waste." </i></p><p>"Because without you, I can't function." Kenji continued in a daze.</p><p>'W- w- what?" Matoko asked, knocked completely off track by what Kenji had said.</p><p>"<i>IDIOT!" </i></p><p>"B-basically, what I'm saying is that the answer is yes." Kenji said.</p><p>Matoko blinked several times as she grasped what exactly Kenji was speaking about. Then her face split into a grin and she rushed forwards, wrapping around hm in a bear hug.</p><p>"<i>Now look what you did. Now she thinks you like her, like you're worth someone like her." </i></p><p>Feeling Matoko hugging him Kenji lifted his arms and returned Matokos embrace.</p><p>"<i>As if you could-" </i></p><p>"<i><b>Shut up." </b></i></p><p></p><p>"HELLLLP!"</p><p>Naotas ear twitched as he sat with his back to the wall, half in/half out of the sun. Next to him lay Lia, curled up in the sun and using his lap as a pillow.</p><p>"Hideo, keep it down. She's just a kid." Naota said.</p><p>"I'm a boy!"</p><p>"Alright, <i>he's </i>just a kid." an annoyed Naota corrected. "But would you still keep it down?"</p><p>"He, she, whatever, the little yard ape has me HOGTIED!"</p><p>"Eh?" was Naotas response. Cracking open an eye he saw that his friend was indeed, hogtied. "How did this happen?"</p><p>Hideo rolled over and fired off his Improved Death Glare to absolutely no effect on Naota. "I was reading a book when all of a sudden he ambushed me!"</p><p>Naotas eye narrowed to a slit as he looked at Hideo. "And what were you reading?" he asked in a deceptively uninterested tone as Hideo broke into sweat drops. "One of those 'special issues' you picked up?"</p><p>"No! Not at all! Just Hot Rod!" was Hideos response as he tried desperately to look innocent(8) and back away. "I was reading a tech article!"</p><p>"Uh-huh. Right." Naota responded as he watched with some amusement as Hideo backed towards the koi pond. "In an American car mag? I doubt that."</p><p>"It's the truth! Why don't you ask him?" Hideo pleaded as he continued to back up, still unaware of the koi pond.</p><p>"I think I will." Naota said as he grabbed a fistful of air and dragged a throughly surprised Christian out of thin air.</p><p>"Hey!" she squawked as she tried to pull herself free. "Leggo!"</p><p>"Quiet, or you'll wake up Lia." Naota warned and Christian immediately froze. He waited a few moments just in case before continuing. "So why did you tie up Hideo anyways?"</p><p>Smoothing down the front of his shirt Christian shrugged. "Matoko asked me." he said.</p><p>"Smart girl." Naota muttered under his breath before looking back up at Christian. "Did she give you a reason why?"</p><p>"She said that she was worried that Lia might see his magazines and wreck the house." was Christians reply.</p><p>Naota looked at Lia for a moment before nodding in agreement. "Definitely a good idea." he said. "So what did you do with the magazine?'</p><p>"I put it back in his backpack." Christian said as she watched Hideo back up perilously closer to the koi pond. "You know, he's about to fall in."</p><p>"He'll be fine." Naota said as there was a yelp from Hideo followed by a splash. "See? He's fine." he pointed out as Hideo came spluttering to the surface.</p><p>"You want me to fish him out?" Christian asked. "Before he drowns?"</p><p>Naota thought for a second before nodding. "Might as well. If he drowns his mom would kill me." she said. "She finally has him trained to keep his mess inside his room."</p><p>"Kay." Christian said with a shrug as she stepped off the porch.</p><p>Hideos eyes bugged out as Christian came towards him. "G-g-get away from me you little monster!" he said as he tried to back away, only to fall backwards into the pond.</p><p>'I'm trying to pull you out, ya doofus." Christian said as she stepped out onto the pond. "Now hold <i>still. </i>This wont hurt."  she said as she grabbed the back of Hideos shirt.</p><p>"YAAAAH! GET AWAY!" screamed Hideo as he tried to thrash his way free. "I WON'T LET YOU GET MEEEE- urk!" he said before Christian tossed him out of the pond.</p><p>"-much." Christian added as she dusted off her hands.</p><p>"Nyaow?" Lia murmured as she stirred. "Whazza goin' on?"</p><p>"Christian just pulled Hideo out of the pond." Naota said. "Go back to sleep."</p><p>"Okay I sleep now..." was Lias response as she curled up into a tighter ball.</p><p>"Nyaow?"</p><p>Or she was until she sat upright.</p><p>'Pocky!"</p><p>Lia was gone in an instant, leaving a trail of dust and a bewildered Naota behind her.</p><p>"How does she do that?" asked Naota.</p><p>"Dunno." Christian answered with a shrug. "Chi?"</p><p>"Probably." Naota said. "Hey, wheres your shadow?"</p><p>"Mamimi?" Christian asked as she looked at Naota. "She's with Mom. They went shopping."</p><p>Getting to his feet Naota stretched. "I thought she had wandered off." he said.</p><p>"Nope." Christian said. "Hey, you wanna spar?" she asked.</p><p>"Sure. Where do you want to?" Naota asked. "Outside, or in the dojo?"</p><p>Looking around Christian shrugged. "Outside. The dojo is too small for what I want to do anyways."</p><p>Arching an eyebrow Naota smirked. "Really? You got a new trick up your sleeve?" he asked.</p><p>"Scared?" Christian asked returning Naotas smirk with one of his own.</p><p>"Of you? Hardly." Naota said as he pulled off his shirt.</p><p>Cracking her knuckles Christians smirk turned into a grin. "Is that a challenge?" he asked.</p><p>"You bet it is." Naota answered as he stopped in front of Christian and went into the crane stance.</p><p>"Well, lets get it on then, pussy cat." Christian said as she went into a boxing stance.</p><p></p><p>The clink of ice cubes melting and shifting in the glass was barely audible as Ranma sat at the table nursing a headache. Wincing at the sound he massaged his temples and wondered when the aspirin would kick in.</p><p>Hearing the mud room door open followed by an "I'm home!" Ranma glanced at the clock, which read 9:45pm.</p><p>"<i>That was an awfully long lunch.</i>" he thought as he sat up. <i>"I wonder how much Matoko made?" </i></p><p>"Hi Ranma." sang Matoko as she stepped into the main room.</p><p>Ranma took one look at Matoko and wanted to know immediately what she and Kenji had been doing besides lunch. Survival instincts however, told him not to make a fuss. That was why he was sitting at the table with a pounding headache and two softball -sized knots on his skull.</p><p>So he decided on a different tack.</p><p>'Hi Matoko." he answered. "You look happy. Did you have fun?"</p><p>"I did." Matoko answered as she lit up the room with her smile. "We made a lot of progress on the next three issues."</p><p>"Congratulation's."said Ranma as Matoko walked past him. "I take it you're over you're writers block?" he asked.</p><p>"Yes, I most certainly am." Matoko said as she stopped and looked at the knots on Ranmas head. "What happened, are you all right?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Ranma answered with a slight nod. "Lia just let me know that she was going to be staying the night at Naotas." he explained.</p><p>"She hit you twice?" Matoko asked, slightly puzzled.</p><p>"Akane added her five yens worth." Ranma added.</p><p>"I see. Speaking of Akane, where is she?" asked Matoko.</p><p>"The sewing room, putting Mamimis new dress together." Ranma said, pointing to the hall.</p><p>"Thank you!" Matoko said before leaving.</p><p>As she left Ranma subtly tested Matokos scent and found elements of lilac, tea, various dishes that she had cooked, and the very faint scent of Kenji. But there was nothing to suggest something untoward s had happened.</p><p>Sighing in relief Ranma sipped his drink, wincing when he moved his head too much.</p><p>"<i>Ahhh...denial. It's not just a river in Egypt" </i></p><p>End.</p><p></p><p>(1)Iron Walkers are members of the Mohawk Nation who build skyscrapers. A good chunk of their work is represented in the New York City skyline.</p><p>(2)Thats a term I picked up playing Halo. It refers to the sound a pump -action shotgun makes as its cycled.</p><p>(3)Just so you know, he uses a vacuum -tube amp to go with his guitar(a).</p><p>(a) which is a '54 Fender Stratocaster.</p><p>(4)Hey, if you're playing a '54 Strat you gotta have the right sound. None like it, guaranteed.</p><p>(5)Thats whats popularly referred to in the West as a throwing star, but come in a variety of shapes and sizes.</p><p>(6)Haruhiro.</p><p>(7)Thats the freshman class that made that high grade catnip.</p><p>(8)And failing miserably.</p><p>P.S.: Sorry about the delay in updates, my loyal readers. I had a nasty case of writers block combined with the tie rods on my truck breaking (And doing the OT to earn the money to get them fixed, only to discover that my warranty is a rip off and my dealer is an ass.) , so my hands were a bit full.</p><p>I'm back on track now so I should be able to crank out updates a bit faster. Sorry for the delay.</p>
