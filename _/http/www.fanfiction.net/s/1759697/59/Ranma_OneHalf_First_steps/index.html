</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: Fist Steps.</p><p>Book Five.</p><p>Chapter fifteen.</p><p>"Wake up Shitheads!" Evans barked into the bus. "Move it! We ain't got all fucking day!"</p><p>Evans stood back as soldiers began piling out of the bus and began to form up in a neat line. He couldn't help but smile with pride as the men lined up- Evans was a good SGM(1). That they doing this within the granite embrace of NORAD, and showing up the zoomies(2) was icing on the cake.</p><p>Within five minutes, all of his men were lined up shoulder to shoulder in double rows, backs to the bus.</p><p>Evans smile turned into a smirk.</p><p>"Face- left!"</p><p>As one, every soldier turned ninety degrees to the left.</p><p>"Fo-ward, march!"</p><p>With that, Sargent Major Evans and the SOCOM Information Warfare Unit marched into the heart of NORAD.</p><p></p><p>Deep inside the SGC, Major Carter heard Colonel O'Neil grind his molars as he looked at a monitor.</p><p>"Problem, sir?" she asked, glancing at O'Neils monitor, which showed a troop of soldiers marching down the corridors.</p><p>"You remember that outside help that Hammond is bringing in?" O'Neil asked.</p><p>Carter nodded. "Yes." she said.</p><p>"That's them." O'Neil told her, tapping the monitor. "Of all the people he had to bring in, it had to be them."</p><p>"Whats wrong with them?" Carter asked, wondering what had her superior in such a mood.</p><p>"They're the Gatekeepers, Major." O'Neil said. "And you didn't hear that name, Major."</p><p>Carter nodded as O'Neil scowled at the screen. "And as for why I don't like them-I have a couple of reasons."</p><p>Killing the monitor, O'Neil spun on his heel and stomped off, leaving scattered enlisted men in his wake.</p><p>Shrugging, Major Carter just chalked the episode up to men in general, and headed back to her lab.</p><p></p><p>After getting the men billeted and squared away, Evans snagged a passing airman and got directions to the briefing room, where he was to attend a briefing with Captain Mendez and the SGC. Getting onto an elevator, he snapped to attention as a blond female Major got on.</p><p>"Ma'am." he said, giving her a crisp salute.</p><p>"Sargent Major." she said, hesitating a moment before returning the salute.</p><p>Mentally, Evans made a note of how she checked the elevator with her eyes, and stood off to one side of him, so he wasn't in her blind spot.</p><p>"<i>Interesting." </i>Evans thought. <i>"She has combat experience." </i></p><p>A quick flick of his eyes to check her name tag, and Evans knew who she was. <i>"Carter." </i>he thought, running through his knowledge of the SGC. <i>"Part of SG 1, works with Dr. Jackson and Teal'c." </i></p><p>The elevator <i>dinged</i> and they both stepped out into the hallway. Turning right, Evans began to walk down the hall along with Major Carter.</p><p>Glancing over her shoulder, she gave Evans an inquisitive look.</p><p>"Where are you headed, Sargent Major?" she asked.</p><p>"Briefing room." replied Evans, mentally giving her points for following OPSEC.</p><p>"Oh." the Major said as they approached the door to the briefing room.</p><p>After showing their ID badges to the sentries outside, they both stepped into the briefing room. On one side of the table sat Captain Mendez, along with a couple of suits, and on the other side sat O'Neil, along with a man in civilian clothes wearing glasses and a man of African ancestry(3) with a metal plate stuck to his forehead.</p><p>Sitting down next to Mendez, Evans mentally identified the people across from him.</p><p>"<i>Man in glasses, Dr Daniel Jackson."</i> he thought, glancing at the man. <i>"Linguist, archaeologist, has severe allergies. Office can make a Marine have a heart attack." </i></p><p>The dark skinned man was sitting directly across from him. <i>"Teal'c. Human born on another planet, hosting a larval alien, turned on his alien masters and is helping to destroy them."</i> he thought <i>"Expert in hand to hand and other forms of combat."</i></p><p>Evans then looked at O'Neil, and saw that he was keeping an eye on him. <i>"O'Neil. Colonel attached to SGC, officially on loan from SOCOM." </i>he thought as their eyes met. <i>"Still owes me fifty bucks for the Army-Air Force game."</i></p><p>A door opened at the far end of the room and General Hammond entered.</p><p>"Ten -<i>hut!</i>"Evans said, reflexivelystanding to attention a making everyone else who was military do the same.</p><p>"At ease." Hammond said, returning their salutes before sitting down. He waited for everyone to be seated before he continued. "As I'm sure everybody here knows, one of our bases in Qatar was attacked yesterday." he said. "And the DOD networks were hacked shortly thereafter. These gentlemen are here to help make sure whoever did this doesn't try to do this with the SGC."</p><p>Hammond gave everyone a moment to assimilate this, then he continued.</p><p>"The DOD networks were hacked twice. Once during the attack on the base on the base in Qatar, the second was on Air Force One." he said. "During that attack two Secret Service agents were killed."</p><p>"By who?" O'Neil asked, interrupting the General.</p><p>"We don't know." Hammond told O'Neil. "But we do know one thing: Whoever it was, they weren't human."</p><p>The members of SG 1 exchanged looks with each other and there were a few glances at Evans side of the table.</p><p>"Ah, sir?" Carter asked, nodding at the other side of table.</p><p>Evans glanced at Captain Mendez, got the slightest of nods, and spoke. "They're not Gaould." he said.</p><p>Carter's jaw dropped and O'Neil scowled.</p><p>"What- how do you-" Carter stammered before O'Neil held up a hand to stop her.</p><p>"We know a lot of things, Major." Evans said. "The Gaould are not the only alien power out there."</p><p>"So who are they, Sargent Major?" O'Neil asked. "You of all people would know."</p><p>"I'm not that good sir." Evans replied, taking his laptop out of Medez's bag and turning it on. "This one caught us by surprise."</p><p>As soon as the laptop was powered up, Evans tapped a few keys and brought up a couple of files. Turning it around, he slid it over to Dr. Jackson.</p><p>"You might want to take a look at this, Dr. Jackson." he said. "You're a linguist, among other things. We could use your help cracking their language."</p><p>Dr. Jackson leaned forwards and started to study the information on the screen. Hammond glanced at Jackson, then turned his gaze back to Evans and Mendez.</p><p>"I take it you two have more information than we do at the moment." he said.</p><p>Mendez nodded. "They're machines, and they can change forms." he said. "The one that was on Air Force One was disguised as a boom box."</p><p>That statement led to a lot sidelong glances around the room.</p><p>"Uh, you're kidding, right?" O'Neil asked. "Cause that sounds like something from a kids Saturday morning cartoon."</p><p>Evans chuckled and gave O'Neil a knowing look. "Oh, trust me, we're sure." he said. "And compared to some of the stuff we've ran into, it's makes changeling machines look <i>tame.</i>"</p><p>"Really." O'Neil said. "You should see some of the stuff <i>we've </i>ran into."</p><p>Evans smirked as he looked across the table at O'Neil. "Wanna bet? Double or nothing." he offered.</p><p>O'Neil ground his molars so loud that Jackson actually looked up from the laptop. "Huh?" he asked. "What'd I miss?"</p><p>"Nothing, Doctor." Hammond said. "We just got a little off topic."</p><p>Both men straightened up in their chairs at Hammond's rebuke, and Evans continued where he left off.</p><p>"As I was saying, we know that they can change form." he said, reaching into Captain Mendez's bag again for a bundle of folders. "Here's the after action report from a SF team that managed to kill one in Qatar." he added, handing out the folders. "They're incredibly advanced, probably several orders of magnitude compared to the Stargate..."</p><p></p><p>"Now arriving at Nerima Station, now arriving at Nerima Station..."</p><p>Naota glanced up from his PDA, then shut it down. Putting it into the pockets of his shorts, he reached over and nudged Lia, who was curled up next to him asleep, leaning on his shoulder.</p><p>Lia nyaowed softly and snuggled closer to him. Naota looked at her for a few moments, shrugged, and tugged gently on one of her ears.</p><p>"Nyaow!"</p><p>Lia snapped awake and looked around with a startled expression.</p><p>"Wakey wakey." Naota said. "Were here."</p><p>Lia blinked and shook her head. "Oh." she said. "Yeah."</p><p>Shaking her head again, Lia slid her feet to the floor and sat up as the train slid to a stop and the doors opened.</p><p>Grabbing their luggage, the two newlyweds got off the train and stepped onto the platform. As soon as they were off the train Lia spotted their welcoming committee.</p><p>"Daddy!" Lia cried, handing her bag to Naota and running full bore at her father.</p><p>Ranma saw her coming and started to back up. "Ah, Lia, Kitten, no, don't, no pouncing- oh crap.."he stammered until he realized it was too late and braced himself for impact.</p><p>The rest of the family parted like the Red Sea moments before she flattened her father with a Neko -Ken Improved Pounce. Naota winced at the impact and walked up to where his mate was sitting on her father, purring.</p><p>"Hey Ranma." Naota said. "You miss us?"</p><p>"Yes..." Ranma grunted. "you kids have fun?'</p><p>Naota smiled. "Something like that." he said, glancing out of the corner of his eye at Christian, who was trying his damnedest to hide behind Matoko. "Hey Christian..."</p><p>Christian gulped at the toothy grin Naota had gave him wondered if it was still possible to escape. He could let Mamimi navigate...</p><p>"Kitten, let me up." Ranma said. "oof... "he said as she rolled off of him "I missed that..."</p><p>As Ranma got to his feet Naota did a quick headcount and noticed that there were a couple of people missing.</p><p>"Hey, wheres Bre and Evans?" he asked. "I thought they'd be here."</p><p>Ranma glanced at Akane before he answered his son in law. "Ah, Evans base is on alert." he said. "Because of that base in Qatar that got attacked."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said. He hadn't been paying much attention to the news, trying to focus on enjoying his honeymoon rather than being a ninja. "How are they then?"</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Evans, we don't know." he said. "He's been out of contact for the last couple of days, and Bre is worried sick about him."</p><p>Naota nodded. "I'll have to go see her later." he said, glancing over at where Kenji stood next to Matoko. "Hey, you been staying out of trouble, Kenji?"</p><p>Kenji shrugged. "More or less." he said, grabbing hold of Matokos hand. "It was different, not having you and Lia around."</p><p>"Same here." Naota said as his stomach growled. He sweat dropped and smiled sheepishly. "Ah.. breakfast was awhile ago and it was a long trip..."</p><p>That was punctuated by Lia's stomach growling too, and there was a ripple of laughter through the group. They headed out of the station and began the somewhat lengthy walk to the Saotome house hold, forming up into a stretched out group with Ranma and Akane up front, with Christian and Mamimi following right behind them, Naota and Lia a few paces behind, and with Kenji and Matoko bringing up the rear.</p><p>Turning a corner, the wind ended up being behind them and Naotas nose twitched as he got a whiff of Matokos scent.</p><p>"Hey." he said, in a whisper that only Lia could hear "Did you smell that?" he asked.</p><p>Lia sniffed the air. "Smell what?" she asked. "All I smell is Kenji and Matoko."</p><p>"check Matokos scent." Naota said. "It's... off."</p><p>Lia furrowed her brows again and sniffed the air carefully. "Huh.." she said "It is off." she said, glancing back at her sister, who holding hands with Kenji as they walked. "I wonder why?"</p><p>Naota shrugged slightly. "Dunno. It could be because she hooked up with Kenji..." he said.</p><p>Lia nodded slightly. "Yeah, probably." she said. "I know I've smelled a change in scents like that before though... I just cant remember where."</p><p>"Eh, you'll figure it out." Naota said, eying Christian. Yes, revenge on him would be sweet...</p><p>Lia saw her husband eying her little brother and gave him a nudge. "You having fun scaring my brother ?" she asked.</p><p>"Oh, I have yet to <i>begin</i> to have fun, Lia." answered Naota. "He has to sleep sometime."</p><p>Lia just rolled her eyes and shook her head. There were some days where she just did not understand men at all.</p><p></p><p>Evans yawned as he sat down at the desk they had assigned him. Setting down his laptop, he powered it up and let it boot up. Once that was completed, he booted up his browser and connected to the DOD network, then to the Gatekeeper server in Japan.</p><p>Once connected, he called up his personal folders and then pulled up the dossiers he maintained of several useful assets he maintained. Selecting the ones he felt were most useful, he opened the one he deemed the most useful and then connected to him via the assets secure video connections.</p><p>On his laptop screen, Evans watched as a window opened and a young male in his early twenties appeared.</p><p>"Hey, Kim I-" the man's face fell when he saw who it was contacting him. "<i>You." </i>he said, venom in his voice. "What do you want?"</p><p>"Your expertise, Mr. Load.."Evans replied. "To help resolve a very critical situation."</p><p>On the other end Wade sighed. He knew better than to complain or try get out of the request- he had been working for Evans for years and knew what the man could do to him if he tried that.</p><p>"This is about what's happened in Qatar, right?" he asked.</p><p>Evans nodded. "Yes." he said. "What do you have?"</p><p>Wade sighed again and started to call up files on his computer. "Not much- it's pretty fragmentary, but I figure you probably have more pieces than I do, so..." he said as he worked.</p><p>"That's true." Evans said. "However, I want your perspective. What does your information say to you?" he asked.</p><p>Wade pursed his lips for a second and thought before he answered. "Well, this is gonna sound strange, but I think that there are two different groups out there."</p><p>Evans arched his eyebrows in surprise. That was completely out of the blue, not what everybody else was saying. Of course, in his experience, Mr. Load was an expert in seeing what was really going on.</p><p>"Really." he said. "How come?"</p><p>"My bots have been picking up weird searches on the web." he said. "Really weird ones- as in some were probing the infrastructure, and others as in they're trying to information about the world in general."</p><p>"That sounds like a hacker network to me." Evans answered. "Nothing new there."</p><p>"That's true." Wade said. "However, I like to keep track of what size line someone's running, and what kind of power they have. My bots look for stuff like that." he said. "I have the signatures of quite a few hackers with that."</p><p>Evans nodded. "I see..." he said. "And what do your bots say?" he asked.</p><p>"Well..." Wade said "Whoever they are, they have a <i>massive </i>connection- better than what I have or probably even what you have." he continued. "And their computing power is monstrous to boot- I don't think theres anything on Earth that can touch what they have."</p><p>Evans put an amused look on his face. "So you're saying little green men are trying to hack us?" he asked.</p><p>Wade gave him a deadpan look. "Don't laugh Sargent." he said. "I checked where the communications came from- they were from satellites, and it wasn't from a ground based station."</p><p>"Hmm." Evans said. "That's interesting." he added. "So what makes you think there are two groups?"</p><p>"You remember how I said I have hacker profiles?" he asked. Evans nodded so he continued. "I've managed to identify at least six separate profiles, and the profiles show that they subscribe to two different methodologies." he said, clicking his mouse. "Three of them are noninvasive and unobtrusive, while the other three are the complete opposite."</p><p>"Thank you Mr. Load." Evans said as the e-mail indicator flashed in the lower right of his screen. "And I assume you just sent me that data of yours?"</p><p>"Yeah." Wade said with a nod.</p><p>"I'll be in touch." Evans said before he broke the connection.</p><p>Opening his email program, he downloaded the files from the server onto his laptop and opened them up- once he had severed his connection to the net. Skimming through the files he whistled softly as he assessed the raw data.</p><p>"Oh my, Mr Load, you <i>are </i>quite good, aren't you?" he said to himself.</p><p>Thinking for a moment, he secured his laptop and got up to go to the mess hall for some coffee. It was going to be a long night.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Saotome household, a shadow flickered and stretched out as Naota peeked out of it like he was a gopher. Looking around, he saw that he was in the main room of the house. Fanning his ears out, he listened for a few moments to make sure that no one was awake.</p><p>He reasonably sure that he would still be able to do what he was intending if someone was awake, just all that much more harder. Hearing nothing but the sounds of slumber, he was satisfied and ducked back into the shadows.</p><p>The shadows seemed to flicker ever so slightly as he made his way upstairs to Christian's room. He paused at the doorway, checking for the booby traps he was certain that the little brat had set. And he was right, they were there.</p><p>Tripwires attached to the door with ofuda taped to it as well. He could feel that the ofuda were no where near the level of strength required to keep him out- if he so much as brushed against the wards they would disintegrate.</p><p>Christian knew this, he had been there when Lia had recounted the story of the Fox and how Naota had inadvertently released him by breaking the wards. Thats why he had tripwires attached to noisemakers all over his door, set to go off if the tension in them went slack.</p><p>And to top it all off, he had set this all up on the <i>inside </i>of the door, making it nearly impossible to bypass them without special equipment. The only reason he knew they were there was because of his demon senses- the black powder used in the noisemakers stunk to high heaven and he could hear the wires vibrate whenever the house creaked.</p><p>No doubt he had his window booby trapped as well. Naota had to hand it to the kid- he knew what he was doing.</p><p>Of course, so did Naota, and he was a lot better.</p><p>For example, one gaping hole in Christian's security was the ceiling, which was paneled with a gap of about fifteen centimeters between the ceiling itself and the attic floor above. That gap was far too narrow for someone to pass through, however for a shadow jumping cat demon, it was easy.</p><p>That was another hole: there were shadows everywhere. Wherever there wasn't any light, he could pass. Like the gap between floors- and walls. So, getting into Christian's room was easy. So was getting into his dresser draws using the same trick, and silently replacing the contents.</p><p>The hard part would be Christian himself. He was a heavy sleeper, much like his father and sister. However, Naota did run a risk of waking while he swapped his clothes. Plus, there was Mamimi. Naota knew she wasn't anywhere as heavy a sleeper as Christian, so he had taken precautions.</p><p>Such as putting a small dose of a very potent and slow acting sleeping powder in her food. The powder was very hard to detect if camouflaged correctly, Mamimi had the same sense of taste and metabolism as her father, so that helped as well.</p><p>The other feature of the powder was that it was slow acting, so you could put it in the targets dinner and they wouldn't immediately pass out. However, when they did go to bed, they passed out and went into a very deep sleep for three to six hours.</p><p>Those properties made it very useful to ninja, for they could slip in and do what they needed to without the target waking up.</p><p>So Mamimi was out like a light and wasn't going to be waking up for a while. Naota hadn't used the drug on Christian because with his heightened senses, Naota feared him detecting it.</p><p>So. Now for the boy.</p><p>Naota rose up out of the shadows next to the futon that the two children were sleeping on and gently moved the blankets back before he gently pried Mamimi off of Christian. Once that was completed, Naota took a small thermos from his butt pack and silently unscrewed the lid.</p><p>Taking a long cotton swab from a pocket, he dipped it into the thermos and took it out, being careful not to spill any. Then, he very carefully dabbed it on Christian's leg.</p><p>The contents of the thermos contained water taken from a cursed spring that was near the Hagakure training camp. It was sealed off and its existence wasn't general knowledge. Naota had found it by accident years ago when he was visiting as a child.</p><p>It was in a cave, sealed off for the most part, but there had been a hole that was just big enough to allow his seven year old self in to explore. There had been warnings all over the place in the cave, carved into the walls of the cave.</p><p>He had almost forgotten about it until his memory had been tripped while he was thinking about ways to get even with Christian. What had tripped his memory had been the mention of Juseynko, and the cursed springs, the Chinese sticking out like a flagpole in his memory.</p><p>The warnings had said that if someone had a curse from those springs, the water of the cave would lock them in that form for anywhere from seven to ten days. So, not having a curse and a spare thermos, Naota had headed straight for the cave and gotten himself some. Not much, just a couple of ounces- more than enough to trip Christians curse.</p><p>Naota smiled behind his mask as Christian shrank and became a redhead. The size difference was going to help as well. Still smiling, he set to work.</p><p>Ten minutes later, his task was complete and set Mamimi and the blanket back in place before he slipped into the shadows and slunk away.</p><p></p><p>Evans found Dr. Jackson in his office, or to be more accurate, the disaster area that he called his office. The door was open when he arrived, and as he looked in he suddenly felt the urge to start screaming at the top of his lungs and start making Jackson start doing push ups.</p><p>Instead, he ignored the impulse and knocked on the door frame. "Dr. Jackson?" he asked.</p><p>Dr. Jackson pushed away from his computer and turned to face Evans. "Sargent Major Evans?" he asked, blinking owlishly. "Can I help you?"</p><p>Evans nodded and pulled a memory stick out of his shirt pocket. "Actually, Doctor, I think we might be able to help each other." he said, holding up the memory stick.</p><p>"How so?" Jackson asked, curious.</p><p>Evans tossed him the stick. "On that stick is some info I got from a very reliable source." he said as Dr. Jackson almost fell out of his chair to catch the stick. "Were not dealing with a single entity, and I the feeling they might be working against each other."</p><p>'Okay..." Jackson said, looking at the stick, then at Evans. "Behavior." he said.</p><p>Evans nodded, slightly surprised. "Exactly." he said. "I figured that you being a linguist, the more you know about a society, the easier it is to translate their language."</p><p>Jackson nodded. "Yeah." he said. "And what do you need?"</p><p>Evans shrugged. "I was wondering if you would know where Teal'c would be this time of night." he asked. "I got a few questions I want to bounce off of him."</p><p>Dr. Jackson nodded an glanced at the clock. "At this time of night, he'd be in the gym." he said. "He likes the practice space."</p><p>"Thank you Doctor.." Evans said before he turned to leave.</p><p>"Uh, Sargent." Jackson called. "I have a question."</p><p>"Ask away." Evans said, turning back around to face Jackson.</p><p>"Why does Jack not like you?" he asked. "Besides losing that bet?"</p><p>Evans reaction was to smile slightly and chuckle. "We had a slight disagreement over methodology a few years back." he said. "Thats all I can tell you. You're not cleared for the rest." he added with a nod before turning on his heel and walking.</p><p>Dr. Jackson watched him go and arched an eyebrow. "Hmm." he said as he turned to his computer. <i>"I think I might want to talk to Jack about this." </i></p><p></p><p>The gate creaked slightly as Naota and Lia stepped into the Saotome courtyard.</p><p>"And so then I grabbed the mayonnaise and I-" Naota was saying to Lia before his senses <i>tinged</i>. "Look out!"</p><p>Half a heartbeat later there was an explosion of dirt and dust where Naota had been standing. Landing in a ready crouch, he watched with faint amusement as Christian came striding furiously out of the cloud of dust.</p><p>"Hello Chris -<i>chan.</i>" Naota said to the irate redhead standing in front of him.</p><p>"I don't know what you did to me..." Christian said, clenching her fists. "But you're gonna <i>DIE!"</i></p><p>'Nyaow?" Lia asked. "What's she-"</p><p>"I'M A <b>BOY!</b>"</p><p>"Alright, <i>he </i>talking about?" Lia asked, looking at Naota.</p><p>Naota smirked as he replied, never taking his eyes off his currently-sister-in-law. "Oh, nothing much." he said. "I just got him back for the catnip bomb in your suitcase."</p><p>"Oh." Lia said, stepping back to a safe distance. "Okay."</p><p>Christian's left eye twitched as she looked at her sister. "He stuck me as a <i>girl</i>!" she said. "And to add insult to injury, he replaced all my clothes with girls clothes!"</p><p>Lia gave Naota a quizzical look. "What's he talking about?" she asked.</p><p>Naota shrugged. "Oh, there's a cursed spring near Mabase that temporarily causes Jusyenko curses to lock in their cursed form." he said.</p><p>"WHAT?" shrieked Christian.</p><p>"Relax." Naota said, folding his ears back slightly. "It's only for six to ten days."</p><p>Christian's facial tic got more pronounced. "Six to ten..." she repeated to herself before focusing on Naota. "I KILL YOU!"</p><p>Naota stood stock still as Christian lunged at him, her battle aura flaring to life around her. As she came close she swung a fist towards Naota, intending to give him a massive chi -infused blow.</p><p>Naota on the other hand, was having none of that. As time slowed to a crawl he looped his right hand up and grabbed Christian's forearm. Guiding the fist to his left as he did a quarter turn, Naota neatly redirected the attack as he stuck his right foot out and tripped Christian.</p><p>Christian shrieked as she went flying into the outer wall, hitting it fist first and blowing a massive hole in the wall.</p><p>"I don't think so." Naota said as Christian slumped coughing to the ground. "But I know you got a lot more fight left in you." he said, clasping his arms behind his back. "So lets see what you got."</p><p>Christian's response was to fling a ball of chi at him. Naota smirked and swiped at it, his claws leaving trails of orange energy. The ball of chi exploded and when the dust cleared, Naota was still standing, completely untouched.</p><p>"You're not the only one who can do fancy tricks." he said, flexing his claws.</p><p>Christan glared at him. "Then you should like THIS!" he said as he punched the ground.</p><p>Naota shifted position slightly, expecting Christian to send a wave of chi through the ground. What happened instead was that something grabbed him and yanked him by the feet. He hit the ground hard and before he had time to react Naota was drug with great force to Christan.</p><p>"HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES?" Christian shouted, rearing up over Naota to strike.</p><p>"No thanks!" Naota said, planting a palm strike to Christian's jaw and sending him flying.</p><p>"What's going on?" Akane asked as she came into the main room of the house, having heard the racket from outside.</p><p>"Oh. Christian's trying to kill Naota for temporarily locking his curse, which was retaliation for putting a catnip bomb in Lia's suitcase." Ranma answered right before Christian landed in the koi pond. "Aaaand, they're done."</p><p>"Oh." Akane said. "Is that all. Never mind then."</p><p></p><p>"A-hem."</p><p>Evans looked up to see an airman standing in front of his desk. "Can I help you Airman-" he glanced at the man's name tag "Morris?" he asked.</p><p>The airman swallowed nervously and held out his hand. "D-Dr Jackson told me to give this to you." he said, holding out a CD-R.</p><p>Evans arched an eyebrow and took the proffered disk. "Thank you." he said, wondering what had the young man on edge. "Something the matter, Airman?" he asked.</p><p>The Airman swallowed nervously again. "Sorry Sargent." he said. "Around here the senior NCO's are God."</p><p>Evans chuckled. "They're that way in the Army too, Airman." he said. "Somebody's gotta run things- after all, its not like the officers know what the their doing."</p><p>Airman Morris's mouth quirked up into a smile. "That's true, Sargent." he said.</p><p>Evans nodded. "Yep." he said. "Dismissed."</p><p>The airman saluted and left after Evans returned the salute. Popping the disk into his laptop, it read the disk and a window popped up with a single text file in it. Clicking on it, there was a moments hesitation then OpenOffice opened.</p><p>"Okay doctor, let's see what you have to say..." Evans said as he began to skim through the report. "What the hell?'' he asked himself after he read through it. "MACHIAVELLI!"</p><p>Sargent first Class Machiavelli came running up a moment later. "You bellowed sir?" he asked.</p><p>Evans rubbed his forehead and pointed at his monitor. "Get ahold of your guy is Sector Seven." he said as he took the disk out of his laptop. "Give him this." he added, handing the disk to Machiavelli. "With that idiot Simmons running around, they need all the help they can get."</p><p>SFC Machiavelli nodded and took the disk. "That's an understatement." he said. "Anything else, Sarge?" he asked.</p><p>''Yeah." Evans said. "Try to get to as much info from your guy as possible."</p><p>''Yes sir." SFC Machiavelli said as he saluted before leaving.</p><p>As SFC Machiavelli walked away Evans began to reread the report Dr Jackson had wrote, only in more detail. This was going to prove...interesting.</p><p></p><p>(1)Abbreviation for Sargent Major.</p><p>(2)Nickname for the Air Force.</p><p>(3) Couldn't think of any better way to describe Teal'c, was not looking to offend, and I apologize if I have.</p>
