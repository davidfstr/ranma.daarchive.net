</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First Steps.</p><p>Book five, Chapter Fourteen.</p><p>The door to the convenience station slid shut behind Takata as he stepped out into the warm velvety darkness of the Nerima night. The beer cans clunked as he shifted the bag in his hand and started walking back to the apartment building.</p><p>After asking Dokuhotei for help, he had ended up playing a couple of more games of shogi with him and talking about various things- not to mention losing track of time and missing the last train home. He had decided to go rent a motel room for the night, but Dokuhotei and Kamone would have none of that.</p><p>They had insisted that he and the kids stay the night with them, and knowing that refusing would have brought an onslaught of absurdities upon him, Takata had accepted.</p><p>So, while the two elder Sanos had rearranged the apartment a bit for their guests, Takata had gone on a beer run as a way of saying thank you.</p><p>Lost in thought as he was, he failed to notice the sound of the car motor coming up behind him until it was almost on top of him. Jolted out of his reverie, he stopped at the corner of an intersection and looked behind him to see some huge(1) foreign car driving down the street.</p><p>Idly he wondered who would be driving such an expensive car in Nerima when it braked and hung a hard left to come to a stop in front of him. Looking down he saw his reflection in the tinted window glass, framed by the light of the streetlight.</p><p>Takata wondered if he had just walked into a noir film when the window rolled down to reveal... Asako.</p><p>With her disguise down.</p><p>Grinning.</p><p>"Heeeey big boy" she said, leaning out the window.</p><p>Looking down at her, Takata couldn't help but notice that Asako's blouse was partially unbuttoned, the fabric pulled taunt by her leaning out, with the swell of her breasts framed by a fringe of lavender lace.</p><p>"Nice car."</p><p>"Thank you." purred Asako. "It's my daddies. Want a ride?" she asked, crossing her arms and leaning forwards on her elbows with mischief in her eyes.</p><p>Oh, yeah, she'd noticed him looking. And Takata could read the implied invitation in her body language. And there was nothing he'd like more in the world to do but to accept her invitation... but his heart sank, knowing what he had to do instead.</p><p>"I'd love one." Takata said, not listening to the drunken frat boy screaming in the back of his mind. "You know where Naotas father lives?" he asked.</p><p>"Sure." Asako said as she sat back in the car. "Finishing up a beer run?" she asked, popping open the door for him.</p><p>"Something like that." Takata said, getting into the car as Asako scooted over.</p><p>Inside the car he saw another female kitsune, also with her disguise down, sitting on the drivers side of the vehicle, asleep and covered by what he guessed was Asako's jacket. Seeing his questioning look Asako followed his gaze.</p><p>"That's Jun." she said by way of an explanation. "She's my new assistant."</p><p>Takata nodded as he closed the door. "I see." he said. "And I take it she's passed out because of all the sake you've been drinking?" he asked.</p><p>"Uh huh." Asako answered as she nodded at the driver, who put the car in gear. "Poor thing has no tolerance for sake." she said as the car started rolling again. "Cute when she's plastered though. Called Daddy a fuzzybutt."</p><p>Takata chuckled as Asako leaned against him, resting her chin on his shoulder and draping her arms around him. Glancing down Takata cleared his throat.</p><p>"Ah, Asako,.." he began.</p><p>"Yes?" asked Asako in a throaty purr.</p><p>"Ah...I can't believe I'm saying this, but, ah, I can't,ah..." he stammered for a second. "I have my kids with me, and I can't, y'know..." he continued, wondering what her reaction would be.</p><p>Asako giggled and stroked his chest. "Oooh, a family man..." she said as she gave Takata a big, toothy, grin full of sharp teeth. "I <i>like</i> that..." she continued, her voice starting to get husky as she pressed in closer to him. "You are <i>soooo </i>fucking hot right now..."</p><p>"Thank you." Takata answered, the scent of sake tickling his nostrils again. "And you're drunk."</p><p>Asako giggled and looked up at him. "Oh yeah." she agreed, giving him another toothy grin. "I really am." she added, snuggling even closer as she yawned. "Think you could help a poor defenseless princess find her way home, oh gallant knight?" she asked, hamming it up by falling across Takatas lap in a swoon.</p><p>"I think I most certainly could for a princess..." replied Takata, surreptitiously eying Asako's cleavage as it threatened to burst out of the front of her blouse.</p><p>"Thank you..." Asako said, pushing herself up onto her elbows. "Enjoying the view?" she asked, now gone velvety.</p><p>Takata forced him self to look her in the eye when he replied, an action that Asako noticed and awarded him bonus points for. "I'd be lying if I wasn't." he said.</p><p>A sly grin spread across Asakos features as he said that. "I like a man who's honest..." she said, casually reaching up and undoing another button on her blouse. "And here's your reward."</p><p>Takata gulped slightly as her blouse came more fully open, revealing more cleavage along with the barest hint of the top of her naval.</p><p>"We can pick up from here when you're ready..." Asako said with a wink, before sitting up and tapping the glass partition with her knuckle. "Takata is going to see Jun and I home." she said after the glass slid down.</p><p>The two men in the front nodded wordlessly and the glass slid back up.</p><p>"<i>Damn." </i>Takata thought as Asako leaned up against him. <i>"She gets more interesting every time I meet her."</i></p><p></p><p>Naota sighed happily, as for him, life was good. He was leaning back against the wall facing the front door, dressed in a sleeveless t-shirt and shorts. Curled up next to him (And partially on top of him) was Lia, her hair down, out of it's customary pigtail in a low ponytail.</p><p>She was wearing what she had slept in, one of Naotas sleeveless tee's which on her was a slightly baggy minidress.</p><p>Glancing down at his mate, he took a moment to take in Lia as she lay dozing against him, purring slightly. Idly, he walked his fingers up her back to her ears, where he began to scratch.</p><p>Lia's reaction was to twist in her sleep slightly and her purr increased by an octave.</p><p>Naota smiled slightly at his mate's reaction and turned his attention back to his writing. Lying next to him on his right side, on the floor was a notebook of music sheets and a pencil. Picking up the pencil, Naota began to put the riffs, chords, and back beats that had been bouncing around in his head for the last couple of months onto the paper into a song.</p><p>As he wrote, everything began to fall into place. A note here, a riff there. He began to write faster, getting into the groove.</p><p>In his head, he heard the base play. In the blink of an eye the notes were on the paper.</p><p>He turned the page.</p><p>The drums he heard, pounding fast and hard, telling of the primeval power that bonded he and Lia, and that they wielded together.</p><p>Happiness, rage. Joy and depression. It was all there- screaming out to the world in his music. It was his statement of defiance to the world, his way of bending the world to his will.</p><p>As he worked the air around him began to grow charged with power, the dust motes dancing in the shaft of sunlight coming from the open door began to wheel and dance with tense energy.</p><p>Turning another page, Naotas hand flew down the page, building to a crescendo that finished with a power chord that would make the very universe resonate.</p><p>As he made the the last stroke the lead in his pencil broke, and the power that had had been built up was released with that last stroke, spiraling outwards from the guest house.</p><p>Outside, the still afternoon air was disturbed by a sudden strong breeze and the birds, which had fallen silent, suddenly flushed and took to the air with a cacophony of noise.</p><p></p><p>At the shrine the sudden jangle of wind chimes made Chikako look up as she felt a buzz in her head.</p><p>"The hell?" she asked to no one in particular as she stepped out onto the porch and looked around for what was causing this.</p><p></p><p>In Nerima, in an apartment above a print shop, a single string on a '54 Fender Stratocaster hummed as if plucked by an unseen hand.</p><p>"Huh." Kenji said, blinking in surprise "That's different." he added before unhooking Matoko's bra.</p><p></p><p>"Nyaow?"</p><p>Lia sat up, blinked, and looked around. Shaking her head to clear the cobwebs she looked at Naota. "What happened?"</p><p>"Huh?" Naota asked, wondering what she was asking about.</p><p>"You used chi." said Lia, stretching. "What did you do?" she asked, her gaze falling on Naotas notebook.</p><p>Naota shrugged as Lia leaned over his lap. "I was writing a song." he said as Lia picked up the notebook.</p><p>Lia's tail went rigid and her fur stood on end the instant her fingers touched the notebook. "Yow!" Lia jumped back, her eyes wide. "What the hell?"</p><p>Naota gave her a quizzical look. "What is it?" he asked.</p><p>Lia gave Naota an odd look. "Your notebook..." she said. "It's infused with chi."</p><p>"Huh." Naota said, his eyebrows arched.</p><p>Lia got a thoughtful look on her face. "Well, now that I think about it, it's not that surprising" she said, leaning back over Naotas lap. "You do know how to manipulate chi, and you do get pretty worked up when you write." she added, running her hands over the notebook, the tips of her fingers a centimeter above it.</p><p>Naota nodded as Lia examined the notebook. "That I do..." he said as she finished her examination and rolled over. "Anything interesting?" he asked.</p><p>"It's beautiful." Lia replied, thoroughly confusing the hell out of Naota.</p><p>"Since when can you read music?" Naota asked, eyebrow raised.</p><p>Lia rolled her eyes and shook her head. "I can't." she said. "I was referring to the chi patterns, dummy." she added, giving him a light punch in the arm.</p><p>"Sorry." Naota said as Lia fanned herself with her hand. "You hot?" he asked.</p><p>"A bit." Lia answered. "Too bad there isn't a fan, or a breeze for that matter."</p><p>Naota nodded as he leaned his head back against the wall and sighed. Suddenly his ear twitched as he heard footsteps outside. Leaning his head back forwards he looked as Tomoe stepped onto the porch.</p><p>"Hey Tomoe." he said as Lia turned her head to look at the new arrival. "Whats up?"</p><p>"Not much." she answered, leaning against the door frame, clad in a halter top and cutoffs "Me and Ryusake were gonna take the kids down to the falls. You and Lia wanna come?" she asked.</p><p>Naota and Lia looked at each other for a second, then back to Tomoe. "Sure." Naota said. "Just give us a minute to get our suits on."</p><p>"Okay." Tomoe said with a nod before turning and heading back to the house.</p><p>"The falls?" Lia asked as she fastened her bikini top.</p><p>"Waterfall near the training area." Naota explained. "Theres a set of large pools that we use as a swimming hole."</p><p>"Really." Lia said as she pulled on a pair of shorts. "Another secret of Mabase?" she asked.</p><p>"Yep." Naota answered with a nod. "We use it as a reward for trainees during the summer." he added, finishing pulling his shirt over his SOCOM. "think of it as an incentive for the younger ones to show up on a day like this."</p><p>"Ah." Lia said as she glanced at Naota. "You ready?"</p><p>"Yep." Naota nodded, grabbing a couple of large beach towels. "Lets go."</p><p></p><p>The low rumble of nighttime Tokyo drifted through the open window in his bedroom as Evans slept, Bre curled up beside him. He had draped his arm around her as he slept and was actually for the first time in his life, content.</p><p>The trilling of his cellphone caused Evans to snap awake, conditioned by years of experience He blinked twice, shook his head, and was about to sit up when the soft warm lump lying next to him finally registered on his subconscious</p><p>Looking down he saw a mass of tangled bangs and one bare shoulder.</p><p>"<i>Bre." </i>he thought as he identified what the lump was. Reaching over to his nightstand Evans picked up the still trilling cell phone and flipped it open.</p><p>Glancing at the number displayed Evans felt his stomach knot up slightly. The only time Captain Mendez called at this time of night it was with bad news. Sighing, Evans pressed the talk button.</p><p>"Hello Captain." he said. "What's up?"</p><p>"The shit just hit the fan, Sargent Major." Mendez said on the other end. "I need you on the street in front of your apartment in ten minutes. Two MP's are gonna pick you up."</p><p>"Yes sir." Evans said, starting to ease out from Bre. "I'll be waiting."</p><p>"Take a bag too." Mendez added as Evans swung his feet to the floor. "You've got a plane to catch. I'll brief you in the air."</p><p>Evans nodded as he stood up. "Right sir." he said. "See you there."</p><p>Breaking the connection, Evans sighed again and rubbed his eyes. Behind him Bre stirred as the absence of her boyfriend registered on her sleeping brain. Evans turned around to look at her.</p><p>Bre was lying on her front, her upbraided hair a tousled mess framing her face as she slept, her mouth slightly open. The wash of light coming in from the open window made her skin glow and she appeared to ethereal, a sleeping angel that Evans wanted ever so desperately to crawl back into bed with and sleep till the sun was high.</p><p>But he knew he couldn't. Evans knew it was because of his efforts and other rough men of violence standing ready that it was possible for his angel and theirs to sleep safely.</p><p>So with heavy heart, Evans got up and went to the closet to pull on his uniform.</p><p></p><p>Seven minutes later Evans stepped out and softly closed the door behind him. Locking it, he picked up his bag and went softly down the stairs, barely making any noise.</p><p>When he got to the street there was a SUV with two MP's sitting in the front.</p><p>"You're late, Sarge." the one in the passenger seat said as Evans came up to them.</p><p>"Sorry." he said, opening the passenger side rear door. "I had to disentangle myself from my girlfriend."</p><p>Both MP's turned to give Evans a surprised look.</p><p>"You got a girlfriend?" the driver asked.</p><p>Evans gave the two men a questioning look. "What?" he asked as he got in. "I'm supposed to have a vow of celibacy or something?"</p><p>"No." the driver said, putting the truck into gear as Evans closed his door. "It's just you've always been the perennial bachelor and all. It's kinda surprising, thats all."</p><p>Evans rolled his eyes. "Just drive Sargent." he said. "I gotta fucking plane to catch."</p><p>"Yes Sargent." the driver said as they pulled away from the curb.</p><p></p><p>Evans was already far over the Pacific when Bre awoke. She lay in bed, half asleep as her brain, fuzzy with sleep tried to figure out what was wrong.</p><p>With a jerk she came fully awake when she realized that Evans was missing. She looked around the bedroom for a few moments, blinking in confusion, then threw back the covers and got out of bed.</p><p>Padding into the living room revealed that her boyfriend wasn't in there either. Scratching her head, Bre figured that he had stepped out to run an errand and decided to get a glass of water.</p><p>As she was drinking Bre happened to glance at her laptop and noticed a note sitting on top of it. Curious, she headed over and picked it up.</p><p><i>Bre-</i></p><p><i>Duty calls, so look after the apartment while I'm gone. I don't know when I'll be back and I can't tell you when I'll be able to contact you due to OPSEC.</i></p><p><i>Love, Bill.</i></p><p>Bre "hm'ed" to herself and flipped up the screen on her laptop. Powering it up she finished her glass of water and put it the sink as the computer booted. Coming back, she sat down and called up her browser. As the tabs loaded she turned on the TV for background noise.</p><p>The babble of newscaster came out over the speakers. Not paying complete attention, she pulled up her email to check her messages. When she heard the words "Attack on a US base" Bre whipped around to look at the TV.</p><p>The channel was CNN, and the newscaster was talking about a base in the Middle East that apparently had gotten attacked -and wiped out. Bre swallowed as footage shot by an embedded reporter came on, showing wrecked aircraft, tanks, and other vehicles And there were bodies there too, Bre could see them, lying amongst the wreckage.</p><p>Bre watched the report play out, then turned back to her computer, fear gnawing at her gut.</p><p>Her fingers flew across the keyboard, and she began to search the net, looking for information. As she searched, Bre listened to the TV, refining her search as new facts were reported. Eventually, she began to piece together a picture of what had happened:</p><p>Apparently, a US base in Qatar had been attacked, by forces unknown. There was rumors that there had been a firefight at a town nearby and there had been air strikes by US aircraft. On who, it was unknown.</p><p>One report she had read had said that the air strikes had been on a giant scorpion, which was widely disbelieved on the forum it had been posted on. Bre, on the other hand, knew that the report could hold a grain of truth and decided to follow up on it.</p><p>As she was composing an email to the poster, another breaking news report came on the TV. Bre stopped typing to listen to the talking head on TV.</p><p>"<i>This just in: there was incident on board Air Force One, which made an emergency landing at Ronald Regan International Airport. The White House Press secretary made a statement saying the President was fine and for the nation not to worry.</i></p><p><i>Reports that Secret Service agents were killed remain unconfirmed at this time."</i></p><p>Bre gulped and started typing faster.</p><p></p><p>Sitting at the front counter in the print shop, Kamone sighed and fiddled with his pencil. Something was wrong. Very wrong.</p><p>The feeling had come over him a few minutes ago, and it wasn't going away. Snapping the pencil in two from frustration, Kamone got up and headed into the back, where Dokuhotei was.</p><p>"Hey, dad, I'm gonna go check up on Bre." Kamone said, poking his head into his fathers office. "Man the front for me, would ya?"</p><p>Dokuhotei looked up from his books. "Something wrong?" he asked, putting down his pen.</p><p>"Just a feeling I got." Kamone replied.</p><p>His father nodded and made a shooing motion with his hand. "Go. I got it covered." he said.</p><p>"Thanks" Kamone said before he left.</p><p>Snatching up his cellphone off of the front desk on his way out, Kamone headed for Evans apartment. He figured that would be the most logical place to look, seeing as how Bre had mentioned over lunch that she and he were going out on a date last night. Part of Kamone's mind seethed at the implications of what that meant, but he stuffed that part of him down.</p><p>He didn't like Evans dating Bre for much the same reasons Naota didn't: She was still his little girl, and he wanted to protect her. And that tied into the other reason that he and Naota didn't like Evans.</p><p>Evans was a spy. His official position was as a liaison between the US Army and the JSDF, but in reality he was head of an elite SIGINT(1) unit, covering a good chunk of Asia and parts of Russia. That was about all he knew, along with the fact that Evans was fluent in five languages.</p><p>That made him a threat. Not only to the clan, but to Bre as well. And he was certain that Evans had kept Bre in the dark about what he did for a living. And thats what scared Kamone the worst about the situation: Bre was in an immense amount of danger that she was oblivious to, and there was nothing he and Naota could do about it without putting everyone else they cared about at risk too.</p><p>Flipping is phone open, Kamone dialed Naota and was rung through to his voice mail.</p><p>"Hey, Nao, this is Dad. Just checking in, making sure you're alive." Kamone said as he turned onto Evans street. "Give me a call when you can."</p><p>Hanging up, he put his cell on quiet mode and clipped it to his belt. Going through the gate in front of the building, Kamone ghosted past the landlady's apartment and the small dog she used as a burglar alarm and doorbell and up the stairs.</p><p>As he walked down the balcony to Evans door Kamone made sure the coast was clear, then pulled out a set of lock picks. When he reached the front door Kamone took one last look around to make sure, then knelt down to pick the locks.</p><p>Putting the picks in the lock he grimaced at the sounds of the TV emanating from inside. That was masking the sounds of whoever was inside, and he didn't want to be stumbling into a trap.</p><p>The last pin fell into place and Kamone gently turned the deadbolt, not making a sound. Then he went to work on the doorknob lock, and thirty seconds later that one was picked.</p><p>Gently pushing the door open a crack, Kamone pulled out a small plastic squeeze tube with a long, thin, spout. Pulling the cap off, he put a few drops of penetrating oil on the hinges and waited a few seconds for the oil to work.</p><p>Then he simply pushed the door open enough to allow him to enter and slipped inside the apartment. Inside the apartment it was as Naota had told him, kitchen to the left, living room with an attached bedroom to the right.</p><p>Sitting at the dining room table was Bre, who was furiously pounding away at a laptop. The bedroom door was open and from what Kamone could see, it was empty. Remembering that Naota had told him that Evans had picked up some Japanese habits, he looked beside the door and saw only Bre's sneakers.</p><p>Reasonably sure that the apartment was deserted save for himself and his daughter, Kamone spoke.</p><p>"Bre?" he asked.</p><p>Bre jumped and practically fell out of her chair in surprise. Whipping around she saw her biological father standing by the front door.</p><p>"Kamone?" she asked incredulously "How the hell did you get in here?" she added, putting a hand over her chest as she tried to get her breathing under control.</p><p>"I am ninja." Kamone answered simply. "Is everything alright?"</p><p>Bre gaped at him for a few seconds, then shook her head "No, it's not alright." she answered, then gave him a funny look. "How did you know?"</p><p>A slight smile formed on Kamone's lips as he kicked off his shoes. "I am a father, Bre." he answered. "I always know when there's something wrong with my children."</p><p>Bre looked like she was about to fire off something scathing, but held her tongue and shook her head. "N-never mind." she said, turning back to her laptop. "Evans got called away to the base because of that attack."</p><p>Kamone realized that was what had her in distress: Evans was called away on duty and she was worried that she wouldn't be seeing him again.</p><p>For a moment Kamone felt a stab of guilt, for that was surely what Haruko had felt every time he had gone out on a mission. And in the line of work that Evans was in, there was very real chance that could happen.</p><p>And he was going to be damned if he was going to let his daughter face that alone.</p><p>"You're worried about him." Kamone said pulling up a chair beside her.</p><p>Bre nodded as he sat down. "I'm worried that he wont come back." she said. "I know it's a stupid thought, cause he works in an office and all, but still..." she trailed off.</p><p>Kamone nodded. "It's only natural." he said. "You care about him."</p><p>Bre nodded as she looked at the screen. "Uh huh." she said, rubbing her eyes. "God, it feels like I've been sitting here forever."</p><p>"Have you ate?" Kamone asked suddenly.</p><p>Bre shook her head. "No." she answered. "I've lost my appetite I'm too wound up."</p><p>Kamone pursed his lips and looked at the kitchen. "How about a cup of tea then? It'll help you relax." he offered.</p><p>Bre stared at the laptop screen for a few moments, then sighed and nodded. "Yeah." she said. "That'd be great." she added.</p><p></p><p>On board an Air Force C-7 out of Misawa AFB, Evans sat on a uncomfortable aluminum seat, oblivious to the racket around him.</p><p>He had been pouring over the latest reports on what had happened in Qatar and on Air Force One, and his mind was racing. Someone had wiped out the base almost to a man, then hacked the DOD's network like it was nothing and then attempted to download everything on their servers before someone there was able to cut the connection</p><p>An hour or so later, the same thing was attempted on Air Force One before again, they were thwarted.</p><p>Shortly after that, a SF(2) team thought killed in the base attack cropped up at a nearby town, under attack from a giant robotic scorpion. Using a cell phone they were able to call in a sortie of A-10 Thunderbolts (3) and an AC-130 Specter and blow the scorpion to hell.</p><p>Closing the folder Evans leaned back and looked at Captain Mendez.</p><p>"Well Sargent Major?" he asked, shouting above the din as Evans handed the folders back to him.</p><p>"Holy fucking shit." Evans said as Mendez took the documents. "No wonder they wanted us."</p><p>"Exactly." Mendez agreed. "Any questions?"</p><p>"Just one." Evans said with a nod.</p><p>"Shoot." Mendez said, stowing the folders in his briefcase</p><p>"Why the hell are we going East?" Evans asked, pointing out the window, where they were clearly heading into the sun.</p><p>Mendez leaned forwards and motioned for Evans to do the same. When they were close together he spoke, loud enough to be heard over the din of the aircraft, but not loud enough to be heard by anybody else.</p><p>"We're heading East, Sargent Major, because the Joint Chiefs, in their infinite wisdom, have decided the safest place for us to be is under a mountain." he said.</p><p>Evans arched an eyebrow. "NORAD?" he asked.</p><p>"Deeper." Mendez replied.</p><p>Evans rolled his eyes in exasperation. "It's bad enough we gotta work with the Air Force(5), but Blue Book?" he said, clearly annoyed. "You've gotta be kidding me." he said as he leaned back.</p><p>Mendez laughed. "I know the feeling, Sargent Major." he said.</p><p>Evans looked annoyed. "And to think I could be holding my girlfriend right now." he said.</p><p>"You got a girlfriend?" the Captain asked. "Since when?"</p><p>"Not again..." Evans groaned.</p><p></p><p>End.</p><p>SIGINT :Signals Intelligence. Basically, Evans intercepts signals from a variety of sources (radio, cell, satellite uplinks, Internet, etc.) and analyzes them.</p><p>Special Forces.</p><p>Also known as the Warthog. Either way, still something you do not want to be on the receiving end of.</p><p>The gunship designation of the Hercules.(a)</p><p>(a) Also something you do not want to be on the receiving end of.</p><p>Being Army, Evans has no respect for the Air Force, thinking of them as a group of pansy assed flyboys.(b)</p><p>(b) who think of the Army as a bunch dumb ground pounders, barely smarter than Marines. (c)</p><p>(c)who really are as good as they think they are.</p><p>Authors note: another update! Yaaaay! A little shorter than my average, but still good, I think. Hope you enjoyed it.</p>
