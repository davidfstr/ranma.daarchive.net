</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First Steps.</p><p>Book Five.</p><p>Chapter sixteen.</p><p>Evans awoke to a pounding at his door.</p><p>"Sargent Major Evans!" a voice called through the door, presumably belonging to the one doing the pounding. "Wake up!"</p><p>Rubbing one eye Evans looked at the clock and saw that it read 04:30 hours. Growling in irritation at his discovery that he had been in bed for exactly two hours he threw the covers back and sat up in bed.</p><p>"Sargent Major -"</p><p>"I'm up gorramit!" he yelled at the door, making whoever was doing the pounding fall silent. Getting to his feet, he walked over to answer the door, wincing as his feet made contact with the cold tile floor.</p><p>Opening the door he found a female Specialist standing there, looking decidedly nervous. "This had better be good, Specialist." he growled. "I just got to sleep three seconds ago."</p><p>The hapless Specialist swallowed and spoke. "There's a phone call for you, Sargent Major." she said. "It's from a man who identified himself as "Tom Little"."</p><p>Evans blinked and rubbed his other eye. "Tell him I'll be there in a minute." he said. "Dismissed."</p><p>The Specialist nodded and dashed off, glad to be out of Evans sight. Shutting the door, Evans grabbed a fresh pair of BDU's from his bag and pulled them on, muttering under his breath about the universe conspiring to keep him from getting a decent nights sleep.</p><p>Ten minutes later he was in the offices that Gatekeeper had set up and was taking the receiver from the Specialist who had woke him up.</p><p>"Evans here." he said into the mouthpiece. "Whats up?"</p><p>"We got one of them." the voice of 'Tom Little' said on the other end.</p><p>"I know." Evans said. "He's on ice, under the Hoover Dam. That's hardly news worth waking me up for."</p><p>"Not that one." 'Little' said. "One of the other ones that just showed up. We caught it with a kid and his girlfriend."</p><p>Evans felt his eyebrows rise and he grabbed a notepad. "What the hell were they doing with it?" he asked.</p><p>"Working with it." Little answered as Evans scribbled a note on the pad and waved a Corporal over. "Most likely to get the Cube, seeing as how the kid is the grandson of the guy who found our Tin Man."</p><p>"Witwike?" Evans asked as he showed the note to the Corporal. He nodded and walked off. "Thats hardly a coincidence."</p><p>"Exactly what I was thinking." Little replied. "There's something they want with this Witwike kid. I'm trying to figure what, but so far nothings coming up."</p><p>"And you want us to look into it." Evans said.</p><p>"You got it." Little answered. "We may be good at figuring out alien technology, but we really don't know shit about intel gathering."</p><p>"Well, it's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it." Evans said with a laugh. "Thanks for the heads up."</p><p>"You're welcome." Little said. "I gotta go. I owe ya one."</p><p>"I know." Evans said with a grin before he hung up. Looking around, he saw SSGT Machiavelli walking into the office behind the Corporal. "Machiavelli!" he yelled, making the man jump. "Go kick everybody out of bed. We've got work to do."</p><p>Machiavelli blinked owlishly at Evans as he strode over to his desk. "Does that include the old man, sir?" he asked. "I rather like being a Staff Sargent, Sargent Major."</p><p>"I'll wake up the Old Man." Evans told him. "Now get going! We don't have time to waste."</p><p>"Yes sir!"</p><p></p><p>Happily curled up in a sunbeam, Naota was catching a few "z's" as he took a catnap.</p><p>"Naota..."</p><p>So he was just <i>slightly </i>perturbed when Lia poked him in the shoulder to wake him up.</p><p>"Mmmrrr?" he asked sleepily, cracking his eyes open and lifting his head slightly to look at his mate.</p><p>"Wake up." Lia said. "We've got to go shopping."</p><p>"Why?" asked Naota sleepily. "We jusst went shopping."</p><p>"Ma -chan asked me to run some errands for her." Lia replied. "She isn't feeling well and Uncle Ono had an appointment cancel on him, so she's going to see him instead."</p><p>Naota spent a couple of moments to puzzle that one out in his sleep -fuzzed brain, and then nodded. "Okay." he said, sitting up and forcing himself awake. "That makes sense." he added as he rubbed an eye. "Where are we going?"</p><p>"Jubaan." Lia answered as she jumped to her feet. "So come on, up and at em'."</p><p>"What's in Jubaan?" Naota asked as he got to his feet. "That's worth me getting annoyed by a bunch of over sugared magical girls who the only reason that they haven't been defeated is because their opponents have the collective IQ of a spoiled grapefruit?"</p><p>Lia gave Naota a dirty look. "Now that's not fair." she said as she walked to the table. "A spoiled grapefruit is a master tactician compared to the Scouts and you know it."</p><p>"True." Naota said as he pushed himself to his feet. "So what's in Jubaan?" he asked, repeating his earlier question. "Besides annoying magical girls?"</p><p>"Herbs." Lia answered, bending down to pick up the shopping list. "Matoko's apparently planning on trying a new recipe and some of the ingredients can only be bought in Jubaan."</p><p>"I see." Naota said as Lia bent down. Every day he found himself gaining more and more appreciation for the ultra low rise jeans that Lia had taken to wearing. "By the way, I think that pink actually looks pretty good on you." he commented.</p><p>Lia turned around and flashed Naota a smile. "Why, thanks Naota, I really appreciate-" she started to say as she remembered as what the only pink thing she was wearing was. "Meep!" she said, slapping a hand on her posterior.</p><p>"You got the list?" Naota asked, walking past her to the door.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia answered as she hitched her pants up. "That was a sneaky trick, Naota."</p><p>"I know." answered Naota as her stepped into his shoes. "But I <i>am </i>a ninja, you know."</p><p>Lia nodded as she walked over to the front door. "Yes, you are." she said. "Did you have to do that?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said in reply as Lia slipped her sandals on. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>Lia gave Naota a slightly irritated look. "I'm the Anti -Pervert, remember?" she asked rhetorically.</p><p>Naota grimaced. "Oh, sorry." he said. "I forgot." he said, offering a hand to Lia before she stepped down on the little landing that was in front of the door.</p><p>"It's okay." Lia replied. "Now that I don't have to deal with idiots and wear a skirt the whole time I'm getting more relaxed about the subject."</p><p>"I see." Naota said, stepping out the door and holding it for Lia.</p><p>"Thank you." Lia said as she stepped out. "You got your train card? We're gonna have to take the train."</p><p>Naota thought for a second and dug out his wallet. "Let me check." he said, opening it. "Yeah." he said after rifling through it. "I got it."</p><p>"Good." Lia said, studying the rooftops. "Now lets get going. We can roof hop our way there." she said, jumping onto the railing before jumping to the roof of the building next door.</p><p>"Haven't did that in a while." Naota said as he leaped after her</p><p>"Well, there's no better time to start!" Lia answered as she took off across the roofs of Nerima. Naota followed close behind.</p><p></p><p>Evans sat at his desk and listened to the sound of the phone ringing in his headset. He -and the rest of Gatekeeper- were busy trying to pull in everything they could about Witwike and his grandfather, and why a bunch of transforming extraterrestrial machines would have an interest in him and his ancestor. Said situation was out of Mr Load's field of expertise, and so to that end, Evans was calling in some outside help he had on retainer for occasions like the current one.</p><p>On the fourth ring someone picked up.</p><p>"Raah?"</p><p>"Hey Nemmie. This is Mr Keys." Evans began, using one of his many aliases for identifying himself over an open line. "Is Jill there?"</p><p>"Raah." Nemmie- aka Nemesis aka Matt- answered. "Raaah rah raah."</p><p>"Thank you." Evans replied as on the other end the phone was set down.</p><p>Evans listened to the background noise filtering in through the headset as Nemmie went to get his better half. He had only been waiting for a few moments when he heard the phone get picked up.</p><p>"Hello?" asked the voice of Jill Valentine.</p><p>"Hello Miss Valentine." Evans answered. "This is Mr Keys."</p><p>"Hello Mr Keys." Jill said. "I take it this isn't just to say hello."</p><p>"Unfortunately, that's correct." Evans replied. "I've got a job for you."</p><p>"What kind of job?" asked Jill. "Umbrella related?"</p><p>"Nope." Evans replied. "And thats about all I can say over an open line. Everything you need to know is in the usual place."</p><p>"Right." Jill said. "Anything else?"</p><p>"Two things: One, an old friend of yours from STARS Alpha is going to joining you for this op." Evans said.</p><p>"Chris?" Jill asked.</p><p>"Bingo."Evans answered.</p><p>"And the second?" Jill inquired.</p><p>"I loved Matt's work in <i>Cratehead 7."</i> Evans added.</p><p>"Oh, why thank you." Jill said, a smile evident in her voice. "I'll pass that along."</p><p>"Thanks."Evans said. "Talk to you later."</p><p>"Later." Jill said before hanging up.</p><p>Hitting the release button on his phone, Evans waited for the dial tone to sound and then dialed another number from memory. Leaning back in his chair, he called up the persona he was going to need for this and got into the right frame of mind as the phone rang.</p><p>It was answered in the middle of the third ring.</p><p>"Hello?" asked the voice of Chris Redfield.</p><p>"Hello Mr Redfield." Evans said cheerfully. "This is your travel agent."</p><p>"Oh, thank God." was Chris's reply, which surprised Evans. Normally Mr Redfield was cool and professional or belligerent, depending on his mood.</p><p>"You're happy to hear from me?" Evans asked. "That's a new one."</p><p>"My brother in law's coming over, and he's bringing the brat with him." Chris said with a growl.</p><p>Evans arched an eyebrow. "Still not a fan of your nephew, eh?" he asked.</p><p>"Look, the last time that little fiend was over here he stole my wallet, my keys, and my gun, and by the time he was done he had wrecked my truck, maxed out my credit cards, and committed multiple felonies." Chris explained. "So yeah, I'm not a fan of him. Please tell me you have something that will keep me far away from my nephew."</p><p>"<i>I oughta introduce you to Naota sometime." </i>Evans thought. "Does the west coast fit the bill?" he asked.</p><p>"I was hoping for something in the opposite hemisphere, but that'll do." Chris replied. "How soon do I leave?"</p><p>"ASAP." Evans replied. "All the info is in the usual place- oh, and by the way, you're gonna be working with Jill this time."</p><p>"Hey, things are looking up already." was Chris's response. "Talk to ya later."</p><p>"Later." Evans said before breaking the connection.</p><p>Taking his headset off, Evans rubbed his eyes and stared at his computer screen. He had two more pieces on the board, and hopefully, he'd be able to get a better picture of the situation before the fertilizer hit the rotary air circulation device.</p><p></p><p>The instant the train crossed into Jubaan Naota felt a now familiar pain erupt behind his fore head, signifying that there were wards up. Grunting his discomfort, he rubbed his forehead as he held onto the grab rail.</p><p>"You know, I'm only coming along because I love you." he said, leaning over and speaking into Lia's ear in a low voice.</p><p>"Wards?" she asked, looking up at him with a touch of concern in her voice.</p><p>Naota nodded in confirmation. "Yeah. Not very strong- more of an annoyance than a repellent to me."</p><p>Lia nodded. "From what I've seen, I think one of the Scouts is probably also a priestess." she said.</p><p>Naota rolled his eyes. "Wonderful." he muttered in an exasperated tone. "She'll probably try to seal me."</p><p>"Yeah, probably." Lia agreed. "Of course, from what I've seen from the other priestesses, you don't have much to worry about."</p><p>"True." Naota said as he rubbed his forehead again. "Mainly all they are is a headache- literally."</p><p>"Don't worry." Lia said, looking up at her husband and giving him a smile. "If any priestesses try to seal you I'll thwap them with my mallet."</p><p>"Thank you." Naota said and gave Lia a kiss.</p><p>She giggled and leaned into the kiss.</p><p>Next to them a salaryman frowned and wrinkled his nose. "Get a room." he muttered.</p><p>Lia, without missing a beat or breaking the kiss, pulled a croquet mallet from Hammerspace and thwacked the man in reply. Releasing the mallet back into Hammerspace, she went back to her kiss and the man staggered drunkenly off to another car with a mild concussion.</p><p></p><p>Rei Hino rocked backwards away from the sacred fire, physically staggered by what she had felt. She had been gazing into the flames, hoping to get answers about what the Scouts enemies were up to, and she had felt wards that she didn't even know existed flare to life.</p><p>And when that had happened, the fire had granted a vision of what had tripped the wards- if you could call it a vision. It had been more like a glimpse, really. All she had seen were two humanoid forms that moved with cat like grace, a flash of gold light, and a loud cracking bang, like a thunder clap.</p><p>Gasping slightly, Rei wiped the sweat that had sprang up on her brow and started to feel around for her communicator. She had no idea what the vision meant specifically, but she did get the gist of it: Something dangerous had just entered Jubaan.</p><p></p><p>Walking out of the train station, Naota rubbed his forehead again with an irritated growl.</p><p>"Those wards still troubling you?" Lia asked as she walked beside him.</p><p>Naota shook his head. "No, it's different ones this time." he answered. "Put up over the train station- really weak ones though."</p><p>Lia glanced back at the station for a moment, shrugged, and turned back to Naota. "They could have been put there when the station was opened." she pointed out. "You know, when the priests bless the place?"</p><p>Naota nodded. "Yeah, that's probably it." he said. "That's what they feel like- normally they're just an annoyance, but after running into those big ones, oy."</p><p>Lia nodded in understanding and patted Naota on the shoulder. "When we get back I think you should talk to Asako about how she deals with them." she suggested. "I mean, think about how old she is. Surely she's had to deal with sort of thing before."</p><p>"Yeah, you're right." Naota answered. "And don't call me Shirley."</p><p>Lia giggled at the <i>Airplane!</i> Reference and hooked her arm around Naotas. "Good one." she said.</p><p>"Thank you." Naota answered, immediately feeling better at his wifes physical contact.</p><p>"And since you're obviously not feeling all <i>that </i>bad, we can get going." Lia added, tugging on Naota's arm and leading him off. "And the sooner we get what we came for, the sooner we can get out of here."</p><p>Naota looked up at the heavens with a relived expression on his face. "Finally, you're starting to make sense!" he said in a mock relieved voice.</p><p>Lia arched an eyebrow at her husband. "I have a mallet, you know..." she said in a deadpan voice.</p><p>"And it's very lovely, and you wield it with perfect skill." Naota added, giving Lia a peck on the cheek.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, Usagi had been the first one to make it to Rei's house, which she privately considered to be a good omen; if the rabbit -head was able to make it in on time, then they should be able to handle this previously unknown threat with a minimum of difficulty.</p><p>Minako, Ami, and Makoto arrived soon after her. Rei had contacted Setsuna and had discovered Michiru and Haruka at the Time Gate with her. She had spoke for the three of them when she declined to help the Inner Scouts and had been evasive in answering why.</p><p>Rei had intended to press her about it, but Usagi's arrival had prevented it.</p><p>Which brought her to her current situation, which was wandering around the streets of Jubaan, acting like a human Geiger counter as they searched for this new entity, whoever he/she/it was. Normally this was Ami's role, but for some reason her Mercury Computer wasn't able to pick up this new threat.</p><p>"<i>And things had started out so well..." </i>Rei thought grimly as she tried to extend her senses and block out Usagi's whining about being hungry.</p><p>"-and my mom's carrot cake too.." Rei's leader, future ruler of the solar system, and sometime large pain in her neck whined.</p><p>Rei ground her teeth and decided that she'd had enough. She respected Usagi, and she was one of her best friends, but seriously, she had her limits.</p><p>"Usagi, put a sock in it!" Rei snapped at the pigtailed blond. "I'm trying to find a new enemy that we can only track by using my miko senses and your whining <i>isn't helping.</i>" she added, growling out the last two words.</p><p>Usagi, to her credit, decided to shut up. She was a whiner and a first class lazybones, but she did know when it was time to get serious. Which was fortunate, because just then her senses flared as she picked up a presence.</p><p>"Hold on, I'm getting something." she said in low voice as to not attract attention from passers by.</p><p>"From where?" Usagi asked, glancing at Ami who was frantically working the Mercury Computer to see if she could pick up anything.</p><p>"Working on it..." Rei answered, closing her eyes and trying to focus in on the presence. "It's getting stronger, so I think we're getting closer to it, and it's in front of us, but thats about all I can get." she added.</p><p>"Ami?" Usagi asked the blue haired girl, who shook her head.</p><p>"Good thing I brought this." Rei said as she dug around in her pocket and took out a small lacquered box. "It's a demon detector, at least that's what my grandfather said." she added, seeing the questioning looks on the faces of her friends.</p><p>"How does it work?" Ami asked, her curiosity getting the better of her.</p><p>"Well..." Ami said, opening the lid to reveal an octagonal piece of wood with a circular groove in it and a small glass ball resting in a dimple in the middle of the wood piece. "First, I take this piece of wood which was made from wood that was taken from a holy tree... " she said, taking the wood out of the box, taking care not to disrupt the glass ball ".. and then I hold it level and then focus my miko powers into it."</p><p>"Then what happens?" Ami asked as Rei closed her eyes and focused.</p><p>"Well, if it works, then the little glass ball should roll into the groove and show us which direction the demon is." Rei answered.</p><p>Everyone gather around and watched with baited breath. For several moments nothing happened, and some began to doubt that it was going to work. Then the ball rattled in it's resting place, rolled into the groove, hesitated for a second, then rolled in a quarter circle and stopped.</p><p>"And I think it's that way." Rei said, drawing an imaginary line from the dimple to the glass ball and pointing in that direction.</p><p>Just then a rather tall, muscular boy in baggy clothes with a rather shaggy haircut and tattoos stepped out of a shop followed by a short, busty, redheaded girl in ultra low rise jeans and a camisole top, right where Rei was pointing. Everyones eyes went wide and they looked down at the detector, where the glass ball was tracking the couple's movements.</p><p>"I think we found them..." Ami said quietly, looking up at the couple walking down the street away from them.</p><p>Rei nodded. "I think you're right Ami."</p><p></p><p>Naota sniffed the air and growled irritably.</p><p>"What?" Lia asked, hearing her husbands irritation and feeling the shift in his chi.</p><p>"We got company." Naota answered. "A priestess." he added.</p><p>Lia rolled her eyes in exasperation. "Of all the things..." she muttered. "It figures. We got all worried about the Scouts and one of your nemesis's shows up."</p><p>"Tell me about it." Naota grumbled as he began to check for other, less obvious, tails.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia agreed with a nod. "How'd you find her?"</p><p>"I smelled her." answered Naota. "She's upwind of us."</p><p>"Ah." Lia said as she sniffed the air. "<i>I</i> can't smell her. Score one for demonic senses." she added.</p><p>Naota looked at his wife out of the corner of his eye. "What about chi?" he asked.</p><p>Lia's eyes  unfocused for a second, then she nodded slightly. "That I <i>can </i>sense." she answered, then narrowed her eyes slightly. "And her friends..."</p><p>"Friends...?" Naota got a slightly confused look on his face for a second and sniffed the air. Filtering out the Miko's scent, he found four other distinct scents mixed in with hers, each bearing that special tang which said that they were something other than a regular human. "Oh hell..." he groaned. "It figures..."</p><p>"What?" Lia asked. "They're mikos too?" she asked.</p><p>"No." Naota sighed. "Check their chi. Compare it to everybody around them."</p><p>"Okay..." Lia said as her eyes unfocused again. "Oh <i>crap</i>." she groaned. "We <i>do </i>have the Scouts following us..." she added. "I'm so used to hanging around people with odd chi signatures that they didn't stand out to me."</p><p>"It's okay." Naota said as he rechecked the area looking for an escape route, or failing that, someplace he and Lia could quietly take them out without alerting the whole district in the process. "Play it cool and look for a place we can scrap with them without getting the TPCD all over us."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said with a nod.</p><p></p><p>"<i>For a demon, he is being remarkably sedate." </i>Rei thought as she and her fellow scouts followed the couple through the streets of Japan. <i>"Not to mention taking his own sweet time..."</i>she added, noting that  it was approaching 11 o'clock in the evening as they passed by a bank clock.</p><p>"Whatever they're doing, I hope they do it soon." Usagi muttered. "Because my feet are <i>killing</i> me."</p><p>"You're not the only one." Rei added.</p><p>Up ahead of them, the couple crossed the street and headed into a local park, which at this hour was deserted- something that was not lost on Makoto.</p><p>"Hey..." she said, nodding at the couple "They're going into that park."</p><p>"And..?" Usagi asked, wondering where the tall brunette was going with this.</p><p>"There's nobody in there at this time of night." Makoto pointed out. "We can sneak in, transform, and confront that demon, and stop him."</p><p>"That would make sense..." Ami piped up. "Stopping him <i>before </i>he can try something or somebody gets hurt."</p><p>"I agree." Usagi said, her voice taking on it's command tone. "Lets go."</p><p>"Right!" the rest of the Scouts said in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Well, they took the bait." Naota said as he watched the five girls enter the park, the pig tailed blond in the lead.</p><p>"Yep." Lia said with a nod.</p><p>The two of them were crouched in the limb of a tree that offered them an excellent view of the park entrance that they had used, along with the surrounding terrain. The lamps along the walk ways were lit, creating wide paths of warm yellow light through the darkness of the park.</p><p>The Scouts used this to their advantage, ducking behind a maintenance shed several meters off the paths to transform before heading to their positions, using the darkness of the park to mask their approach -or it would have masked their approach, had Naota and Lia stayed on the paths, where even a humans night vision would have been blinded by the glare of the lamps.</p><p>However, as they were up in a tree, shielded from the lamps glare by the tree's shadow, and having demonic and Neko Ken Improved night vision, they were able to see them quite well, Naota even better that Lia.</p><p>'Well, they do have some tactical sense after all." Naota commented. "Using the darkness to cover their approach. They're not complete amateurs."</p><p>"But they're still amateurs." Lia said. "And they're getting close. Get ready."</p><p>"I always am." Naota answered as he drew a kunai from his back pocket and held it behind his back as the Scouts came to the foot of the tree.</p><p>With some amusement, he watched as they ran <i>past </i>their position for a couple of meters before the one with red skirt stopped and looked at something in her hand. She said something to her companions and motioned behind her, at the tree.</p><p>Naota and Lia watched as the Scouts backtracked and slowly approached the tree that they were hiding in. Narrowing his eyes, Naota gave the Scout in the red a closer look and saw that she was holding a piece of wood in her hand with something shiny on it.</p><p>"<i>That would be the miko."</i> Naota thought, then noticed the Scout in the blue with some sort of visor and what looked like a palmtop computer in her hand. <i>"And hello there. It looks like they have a computer expert..."</i></p><p>Tapping Lia on the shoulder, Naota pointed at the red and blue scouts and indicated that he had chosen them as targets. Lia nodded and pointed out the tall brunette and the other blond and indicated that she had chosen them as her targets.</p><p>Naota gave her a confirming nod and shifted his position slightly as he prepared to throw his kunai while Lia cupped her hands together to focus her chi.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying that they're in that tree?" Usagi asked as they cautiously approached said tree.</p><p>Rei nodded and looked down at the chunk of wood in her hand. "Yeah, near as I can tell." she said. "This thing isn't that precise." she added.</p><p>"I think I might be able help with that." Ami said suddenly.</p><p>"You might?" Rei asked, surprised by her comrades statement. 'You figured out how to track their energy?"</p><p>Ami shook her head. "No, but they do give off body heat." she said, pointing to a dark spot in the branches. "They're right there."</p><p>Before anyone could do anything else, there was a <i>swish</i> of something being thrown followed by the <i>ching! </i>Of metal meeting wood. Rei yelped in pain and jumped back holding her hand, where she had a rather nasty cut on her palm.</p><p>She only had time to look down and see her detector split in two by a weird looking knife before she and her comrades were knocked ass over teakettle by an explosion.</p><p>The explosion threw her a good five meters and she landed hard on her back, knocking the wind out of her. Head pounding, she drew a rather painful breath and rolled over onto her knees.</p><p>"Owwww..." Rei groaned as she staggered to her feet. "What hit us?"</p><p>"A chi attack." a male voice said.</p><p>Rei looked up and saw the demon, standing in the light of a street lamp, his hand clamped over a trembling Sailor Mercury's mouth as he used her as a human shield.</p><p>"Hello, <i>miko.</i>" the demon said, the last word laced with venom. "We have some business to discuss."</p><p>"Let her go, or you'll be sorry..." Rei growled, anger flashing in her eyes as she prepared to throw an ofuda.</p><p>The demon scowled and his eyes flashed red. "I wouldn't do that if I were you..." he said, his voice taking on a sub zero chill. "Your friend might get hurt." he added, extending a claw and placing it against Mercury's carotid artery.</p><p>Rei glared in impotent fury at the demon and lowered her ofuda. "What do you want?" she carefully ground out the words.</p><p>"North of this park there is a shopping mall undergoing renovation." the demon said. "We can talk there... alone." he added, flexing his clawed finger in a silent threat as to what would happen to Mercury if she didn't come alone. "Got it?"</p><p>Eyes blazing with fury, Rei nodded. "Yes." she said. "I got it."</p><p>"Good." the demon said. "Don't be late."</p><p>The demon seemed to flicker for a moment, then he was gone. Glancing back at where her comrades were, Rei saw that while she had been focusing on the demon, they'd had their hands full with the demon's partner.</p><p>She almost said something, but the demon's threat echoing through her mind stopped her from saying anything. Sighing in defeat, she headed north.</p><p></p><p>Naota found that getting inside the heavily barricaded mall with a prisoner was fairly easy, thanks to his shadow jumping ability. Inside, the place was gutted, with dust and debris everywhere along with scaffolding, various bits of machinery, and building supplies.</p><p>"Perfect..." Naota said aloud so his captive could hear him.</p><p>A sudden rush of fear scent over powered the scents of concrete, sawdust, and metal, his demonic instincts enjoying her fear and making him purr in a low rumble.</p><p>Part of him wanted to torture her some more, just to keep enjoying the scent of her fear, but he was too well trained and too well disciplined to give in to his base instincts. So, instead, he put her into a choke hold and flexed.</p><p>His captive struggled for a few moments and tried to scream, but couldn't because of his arm wrapped around her neck. She gurgled something for a moment, then she passed out from the constricted blood flow to her brain.</p><p>As his captive went limp, Naota lowered her to the ground and looked around for something to tie her up with. Spotting a coil of rope and a roll of duct tape, he smiled. Five minutes later she was bound, gagged, and hanging from the ceiling by her wrists.</p><p>With that taken care of, he pulled the Mercury Computer out of his pocket along with his PDA and got to work. He had a few minutes before the miko showed up and he might as well make the best of them.</p><p></p><p>It had taken Rei ten minutes to find a way in after she got to the mall, having had to climb some scaffolding and go in through a hole in the wall covered by a sheet of plastic.</p><p>Inside it was a mess, and almost pitch black, the only illumination coming from the wash of light pollution seeping in through the skylights and the hole she had came in through. This of course made it almost impossible to see where she was going, a fact painfully reinforced when she barked her shin on something.</p><p>"<i>We have fantastic magical powers, fantastic magical devices, but yet we don't have friggin' </i>flashlights?" Rei thought irritably as she rubbed the sore spot on her shin. <i>"Next time I see Luna I'm going to bring that up..."</i></p><p>having massaged her shin, she straightened back up and thought for a second. Holding her hand out, she concentrated and focused a portion of her power into a small fireball.</p><p>"<i>Muuch better." </i>she thought as the room was lit up in a red glow. <i>"It's crude and I risk setting the place on fire, but it beats stumbling around in the dark and breaking my neck." </i></p><p>And now that she could see, Rei was able to pick her way out of the gutted store and into the mall proper. Once she was out of the store, it was light enough for her to see and she extinguished the fireball.</p><p>Glad that she was no longer risking setting the place on fire, she took a look around and wondered where the demon was. He was around, that much she could tell with her miko senses, but she couldn't figure out in which direction he was, which was odd.</p><p>That's when a faint, slow, rhythmic creaking sound caught her attention. Closing her eyes, Rei focused in on the sound and located where it was coming from and started walking towards it, her the clicking of her pumps heels echoing in the cavernous mall.</p><p>She found the source of the noise in short order: it was Mercury, hanging by her wrists from a rope tied to an exposed ceiling beam.</p><p>"Mercury? Are you okay?' she asked, keeping her voice low. "Mercury?" she asked again when her teammate didn't respond.</p><p>Now worried, she looked around and saw a pair of escalators nearby that lead to the ground floor. Taking them, she got to the ground floor and hurried over to Mercury. When she got to her, Rei was relieved to see that her friend was just passed out.</p><p>Breathing a silent sigh of relief, she stepped back and started to look around for a way to get Mercury down.</p><p>"Hello Miko."</p><p>Rei whirled around when she heard the demon's voice come from behind her, an ofuda out and charged with her power as she flung it at him. Only instead of striking him and sealing him, the demon ducked and swiped with his claws as the ofuda passed harmlessly by overhead.</p><p>To Rei, it felt like her feet had gotten taken out from under her and she toppled over, landing on her front and cracking her chin on the cement floor. Her vision exploded into stars and it took her a moment to clear her head.</p><p>She tried to get to push herself to her knees, but for some reason she couldn't feel her legs from the knee's down. Rei wondered what the demon had did to her when her right arm bumped something. Still somewhat stunned from when her chin had met the floor she looked over and saw a woman's leg, clad in red pumps.</p><p>Instinctively she looked up and saw that the leg terminated in a bloody red stump above the knee. And that's when she realized a jolt of terror that it was her <i>own</i> leg that she was looking at.</p><p>Mercifully, at this point darkness claimed her.</p><p></p><p>With a sigh, Naota cinched the last not tight and stepped back to look at the miko. She was very pale and breathing shallowly, but she was still alive. He had tied off the stumps of her legs, using rope as a tourniquet, and then had used the entire contents of the large first aid kit in the construction site supervisor's office to dress her wounds.</p><p>He'd gone into this encounter looking to neutralize the threat that the miko had posed to him, not kill her. He wasn't exactly happy with what had happened, but it was preferable to the alternative.</p><p>That being said, he was far from out of the woods by a long margin. While he may have stopped the bleeding and dressed the mikos wounds, there was still a good chance that she could die if she didn't get immediate medical attention. Fortunately, there was a bank of pay phones outside that he could use to call for paramedics.</p><p>Taking the Mercury Computer from his pocket, he tossed it to one side like it had been dropped there casually and ignored- which was as far from the truth as one could get. When he had jacked into it, intending to copy it to the Hagakure servers using his PDA as a wireless link, he had been surprised to find that it was several orders of magnitude more powerful than the fastest supercomputer on the planet, with several terabytes worth of data in its memory.</p><p>Not to mention it was all written in an alien computer language that was completely incompatible with ASCII, the language of almost every computer on Earth.</p><p>This would have been a major problem if Mercury hadn't written an interface that enabled it to talk to regular computers. And so he had quite neatly inserted a key logger and a back door into the program.</p><p>From now on, whenever she was using the Mercury Computer, it'd be transmitting her keystrokes and allowing the clan's hackers in so they could root around in its memory.</p><p>Smirking at his extreme cleverness, Naota stepped into a shadow and emerged on the roof of the mall to have a look around at the general area before making the call. The last thing he wanted to get spotted by someone- he was a ninja and valued stealth above all else.</p><p>"Dead Scream."</p><p>Thus Naota was extremely pissed that he got ambushed the instant he shadow jumped onto the roof. Snarling with rage he jumped clear as the beachball sized black orb smashed into the roof where he had just been standing.</p><p>Landing neatly several meters away he heard the sound of footsteps right behind him. Instincts honed by a lifetime of training kicked in and he whirled around to see a Scout he didn't recognize with long wavy midnight blue hair drawing back on a bow while a blond one with short hair in a boys cut charged at him with a scimitar.</p><p>Time seemed to slow to a crawl as Naota's brain saw two threats and reacted accordingly: He drew his SOCOM, and moving laterally to the nearest cover, tapped two rounds each into their heads.</p><p>His brain registered someone screaming and he saw a Scout with long black hair swinging a long staff around. Shifting his aim, Naota opened fire. At this range headshots were next to impossible, so he went for body hits.</p><p>His first two shots hit, the third missed cleanly. The Scout felt the hits -230 grain jacketed hollowpoint .45 slugs packed a wallop, even at forty yards- but didn't go down, but his shots did spoil her aim and she ended up blasting a large hole in the roof.</p><p>Naota saw that she didn't go down and figured that she was wearing armor of some sort, so he decided to go for her legs and shifted his aim accordingly. Tapping out three more shots, the first one missed and the other two struck her in the leg.</p><p>The unknown scout screamed and clutched at her leg as she fell. That's when he executed a tactical reload(1) and charged. The Scout saw him and raised her staff, but she was too late, Naota knocking it away with a swipe of his claws.</p><p>Slamming her to the roof, he shoved the muzzle of his pistol under her jaw.</p><p>"Hi there." Naota said, his voice an inhuman growl. "Who are you, and why are you and your friends trying to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Setsuna grimaced from the fiery pain in her leg as she looked up at the demon holding her at gunpoint, confusion fighting with the pain. How could he <i>not</i> know who the senshi were...</p><p>"We're the Sailor Scouts-" Setsuna began, speaking through clenched teeth. Getting shot <i>hurt</i>, worse than all the other times she'd gotten injured...</p><p>"I know that." the demon said, snapping her back to reality. "I've seen them on the news, the ones that were following me and my mate." he added. "I was talking about <i>you. </i>No Scout matching you or your friends description has ever been reported."</p><p>"I- I'm Sailor Pluto." she explained. "I'm the Guardian of Time. The ones you killed are Sailors Neptune and Uranus."</p><p>The demon grunted slightly at the information, and one ear swiveled around as if it heard something. "So why haven't I heard of you?" he asked.</p><p>"We prefer to work seperate from the Inners." Setsuna told him.</p><p>"Inners?" the demon asked, momentarily confused by her terminology. "Oh- right. You're all named after planets." he refocused his attention back on her. "Why did you attack me?"</p><p>"You're a threat to the creation of Crystal Tokyo." Setsuna answered.</p><p>The demon blanched. "Crystal Tok- oh you <i>have</i> got to be kidding me." he said. "You're a time traveler?" he asked.</p><p>Setsuna nodded.</p><p>"And you came back in time I take it?" he asked. Setsuna nodded again. "Okay then. I may not have been the best of students- hell, I barely passed science- but even <i>I </i>know enough physics that the Schrödinger's Cat theory blows multi kilometer holes in your story."</p><p>"What?" Setsuna asked, completely baffled by the sudden change in the direction of the conversation. "What are you talking about?"</p><p>The demon looked down at her with puzzlement. "You don't know what I'm, talking about?" he asked. Setsuna shook her head. " Schrödinger's Cat? If you observe an object, you change the nature of an object?"</p><p>She gave the demon a blank stare. The demon sighed in irritation and his ears folded back. "By coming back in time, you've changed events and the city you knew as Crystal Tokyo will never exist."</p><p>Setsuna stared at him for several moments, then violently shook her head. "No!" she said firmly "It <i>will </i>happen. I'll <i>make</i> it!"</p><p>This time the demon growled. "Oh for the love of- just what I need, a fanatic." he said to himself. "Look, believe what you will. I don't care, just as long as your little obsession doesn't involve me or my family, got it?"</p><p>Setsuna looked at him for several long moments. "You want us to leave you alone, after you've crippled one of us and killed two others?" she asked.</p><p>"You're the ones who started it." the demon said glibly. "It's not my fault that you and your buddies have poor tactical thinking and intelligence gathering." he added as sirens began to sound in the distance. "And it sounds like someone heard my shots, so its time for me to go- but before I do, be sure to tell your leader this: Leave me and my family alone, and I'll leave you alone. Mess with me, and more people are going to die." he continued. "Got it?"</p><p>Setsuna nodded slightly. "I'll pass that along." she said.</p><p>"You do that." the demon said before releasing her and taking off at a run, scooping up his ejected magazine before leaping off the side of the roof.</p><p>Setsuna watched him go, and stared at where he had leaped for several moments as the sirens got louder. Then she looked at the bodies of Neptune and Uranus, lying crumpled like rag dolls on the roof.</p><p>"I'm sorry." she said to them, then pushed them from her mind. She could morn them later- right now she had to get to the Princess.</p><p>Grinding her teeth against the pain, Setsuna got to her feet.</p><p></p><p>Evans better picture resolved quicker than he had expected, mainly due to the debriefing that the Witwike kid had undergone. This had revealed a few crucial facts that connected with the ones that Evans knew and gave him his better picture.</p><p>One fact that those of appropriate clearance knew was that the Tin Man that was on ice under the Hoover Dam and the Cube that they had found in the Colorado River were connected, they just didn't know in which way.</p><p>Another fact was that said Cube could cause electronics to change, to shift from being mere chunks of machinery to actual life forms- hostile ones, but life forms never the less.</p><p>One new fact that they had which connected to the other ones was that they had a name for the Tin Man: Megatron. They also now knew how he and the Cube were connected: the Cube could bring life back to the ET's home world of Cybertron, which had been devastated after a war between two factions of the cybernetic ET's, the Autobots and the Decepticons.</p><p>Megatron was the leader of the Decepticons, and from the description of them, they sounded like your typical bad guys: Arrogant, genocidal, and evil. There were no shortage of people who could fit that description on Earth it self, not to mention the ones that the SGC had ran into.</p><p>The Autobots were the complete opposite of the Decepticons, from the Witwike kid's description of them, they were the prototypical 'good guys'.</p><p>Both factions were searching for the Cube to restore life back to their world, and if the Decepticons got it, it was game over for everyone.</p><p>"<i>There are times..." </i> Evans thought tiredly as he stared at his computer screen <i>"Where ignorance is bliss."</i></p><p>Leaning forward, he snagged his phone and dialed his commanding officer. "Captain?" he asked. "We need to talk to Hammond and the SGC."</p><p></p><p>End Book Five.</p><p>(1)That's where you eject the partially emptied magazine from your weapon and insert a fresh one.</p><p>Authors note: finally got over the frakkin' writers block that's been plaguing me with this story and got this chapter hammered out. I decided to end the book here because it's gotten to be the longest book so far (fifteen chapters! My how times flies when you're having fun...) and to start a fresh approach to writing this story in Book Six.</p><p>This fresh approach is keep the chapters shorter, more like Doppler Effect in length. This should enable me to get chapters out faster so you, my loyal and patient readers can enjoy the further shenanigans of the Nerima Wrecking Crew and their children.</p><p>Zombie Boy.</p><p>PS: thank you for your patience and <i>not </i>hunting me down and giving me a severe beating for dwadling on getting the chapters out.</p>
