</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book five.</p><p>Chapter 7.</p><p>Deep in slumber Lia's ear twitched when  she heard the door to her room open. She stayed asleep as the sounds  of footsteps padded up next to her were followed by the rustle of  cloth as someone knelt down next to her, so for all intents and  purposes Lia was dead to the world.</p><p>Matoko sighed as she looked down at her  sister, who was the picture of contentment  as she lay curled up in a ball in the sun streaming in from her  window.</p><p>"<i>Waking anyone who is that  comfortable should be a crime." thought</i>  Matoko as her mouth quirked into a smile. <i>"But tomorrow  </i>is <i>her wedding day and  we have to get her and everything else ready." </i>she  reminded herself as she reached for Lia.</p><p>"Lia, wake up."  Matoko said as she shook her sisters shoulder. Lias reaction was to  'nyaow' and curl tighter into a ball. "Lia, <i>wake up</i>."</p><p>Lia 'nyaow'ed again  and tried to roll over, but Matoko grabbed onto Lias side with both  hands and stopped her. Lia tried to roll over twice more then resumed  her original position.</p><p>Seeing that current  course of action wasn't working Matoko decided to try a different  course of action. Getting to her feet she took a couple of steps back  and cleared her throat.</p><p>"Lia, breakfast  is ready." said Matoko.</p><p>The results were  instantaneous. Lias eyes snapped open and  she sat bolt upright in bed.</p><p>"Nyaow?" she  asked as she blinked the sleep out of her eyes. "There's  breakfast?" she asked.</p><p>Matoko nodded in  response to her sisters question. "Yes, there is. And before you  ask, Kasumi and I made enough for everybody." she said.</p><p>"Okay." Lia  said distractedly as she looked around her  room. "Where's Naota?" she asked.</p><p>"He's at his  apartment I imagine." Matoko answered. "Where else would he be?"</p><p>"Here." Lia  said, smacking the futon for emphasis. "Where he's supposed to be.  Why isn't he here?"</p><p>That made Matoko  chuckle. "Because you're getting married tomorrow, silly." she  said. "Remember?"</p><p>Lia blinked a  couple of times then shook her head. "Oh, yeah, that's right."  she said. Rubbing her eye Lia got to her feet. "I need breakfast."  she said.</p><p>"It's  downstairs." said Matoko as they walked out the door.</p><p>Lia stopped as  Matoko turned to the right and began walking further down the hall.  "Aren't you coming?" she asked.</p><p>"I have to wake  up Christian and Mamimi." explained Matoko as she stopped at  Christians door.</p><p>"Okay." Lia  said as she headed downstairs. "I'll save some for you."</p><p>Genma put down his  bowl and sighed happily- or at least as happily as a panda could  sound.</p><p><b>That was a  delicious breakfast Kasumi </b><i>flip  </i><b>Thank you </b>he  signed.</p><p>Kasumi smiled and nodded her thanks. "Why thank you Mr. Saotome."  she said. "But it wasn't all my doing. Matoko helped as well."</p><p><b>I can see where  she learned how to cook then </b>Genma  signed. <b>Her husband is going to be one lucky-</b></p><p>"<b>Panda!" </b></p><p>Genmas bugged out as he sweat dropped. <b>Oh  no, </b><i>flip </i><b>Not again-</b></p><p>Everyone at the table winced as Genma got  nailed with another Panda Glomp©.  Ranma and everyone else chuckled as Genma unsuccessfully to pry his  granddaughter off of him.</p><p>Eventually Lia let go and rolled off of him onto her feet. Pulling  her shirt down she then walked around the table to her usual place  and sat down, where there were chopsticks, bowl, and a cup of tea  waiting for her.</p><p>"Hi Grandma, hi Kasumi." Lia said as she held out her bowl. "Miso  soup please."</p><p>As Kasumi ladled soup into her bowl Lia  took a look around the table. Genma was looking severely glomped,  while Nodoka was looking shocked and Ranma was scowling slightly.</p><p>Conspicuously absent was Akane, and now  that Lia thought about it her uncle Ono.</p><p>"Hey, Kasumi, where's Mom and Uncle Ono?" she asked as she took  her bowl back from Kasumi.</p><p>"They and Tatewaki are out picking up some things we ordered for  tomorrow." answered Kasumi. "Would you like some rice?"</p><p>Lia thought for a second then nodded. "Yes, thank you." she said.  "When did Uncle Tatewaki and Aunt Nabiki get in? They weren't here  when I got home last night."</p><p>Picking up a bowl Kasumi began to scoop rice into it. "They got in  late last night. Chisu had a kendo match." she said.</p><p>Lia nodded. "Okay." she said as her ears twitched. Looking up at  the ceiling she focused then and picked up shuffling footsteps and  low groans. "And speaking of them, Aunt Nabiki and Chisu are up.  That, or there's a couple of zombies upstairs."</p><p>Kasumi smiled at her nieces joke as she handed Lia her rice.  "Actually, with those two it's not too far from the truth." she  said.</p><p>Lia flexed her ears back and forth in amusement as she dug in. The  sudden thunder of little feet across the ceiling announced the  Christian and Mamimi were up. Two half -coherent yells upstairs said  that Nabiki and Chisu had discovered that as well.</p><p>The thundering got louder when they hit the stairs and charged  downstairs.</p><p>"Christian! Mamimi! No running in the house!" Ranma yelled, and  the thundering stopped. A few moments later Christian and Mamimi  reached the foot of the stairs and walked over to the table. "That's  better."</p><p>As they sat down Kasumi started to dish them both up some rice. "Good  morning." she said sweetly. "And how did you sleep?"</p><p>Christian and Mamimi both shrugged as they took their bowls from  Kasumi. "I slept pretty good." said Christian before he dug in.</p><p>"I slept well too." Mamimi added before she too started eating.</p><p>"That's good." Kasumi said as she looked over Mamimi. "You  have a pretty nightgown Mamimi." she said.</p><p>Mamimi paused and looked up at Kasumi. Swallowing she  nodded. "Thank you." she answered. "Lia made it for me."</p><p>"You did?" Kasumi asked as she turned to face her niece.</p><p>Lia nodded in reply as Nodoka spoke up. "I didn't know you could  sew." she said.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia answered as she put her soup bowl down. "That's how  I was able pass Home Ec with out being able  to cook."</p><p>"Just like her father." Ranma added with a mischievous  gleam in his eye.</p><p>Nodoka opened her moth to reply, thought about it for a second then  shook her head. "You're impossible." she said.</p><p>"It's the truth." answered Ranma as his face threatened to break  into a grin. Still trying to keep from grinning he looked at Lia.  "That reminds me. With everyone here, the furo's  gonna be pretty busy so you and Matoko will want to get your baths in  pretty soon."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said with a nod. Nodding her head towards Christian  and Mamimi she continued. "And while we're at it we can scrub the  little ones too." she added. "That, and I'm gonna need the help.  I'm going to be washing my hair, and that's at least a two person  job."</p><p>As Mamimi squealed with delight Matoko came down the stairs with her  robe and fresh clothes for the day. "Did I miss anything?" she  asked.</p><p>Lia turned around and looked at her sister over her shoulder. "We're  gonna have help when we wash my hair." she said. "And then  afterwards I was gonna head over to Naotas-"</p><p>"<i>Ahem." </i>Ranma coughed. "Sorry  to interrupt, but you're staying here  today."</p><p>Lia's eyes bugged out as she looked at her father. "Excuse me?"  she asked. "But why?"</p><p>Ranma closed his eyes and sighed as he reminded himself that she was  an adult in everything but name and spoke before Nodoka could.</p><p>"Because it's bad luck for a bride to see her groom before she is  married." Ranma said as he mentally prayed to every god and kami  he could think of that Lia would accept it. "That's why."</p><p>Lia blinked and looked down at the table for a second as she  considered what her father had said, then looked up at her father and  shrugged.</p><p>"Okay." she said before turning back to her breakfast.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye Ranma saw Nodoka nod slightly in  approval as she picked up her teacup. Sending out a silent 'thank  you' to any listening kamis Ranma drained  his tea and sighed again as he passed his tea cup to Kasumi.</p><p>"Does the unlucky aspect apply if the brides sister goes over to  make sure the groom and his best man have a proper breakfast?"  Matoko asked.</p><p>Caught by surprise as he was reaching for  the soy sauce Ranma looked up at Matoko instead of where he was  reaching, so his hand brushed up against the water pitcher -and the  condensation from the ice water within.</p><p>Her hand closing on empty air Ranma scowled. "Dam- no, Matoko, I  don't think it applies." she said as Matoko, seeing her fathers  predicament slid the bottle over to her. "Thank you." she said as  she grabbed the bottle. "I hate it when that happens."</p><p>Matoko smiled as Ranma continued to grumble about her curse.  Finishing her portion she put her chopsticks down she stretched. "I'm  done." she said as Lia put down her chopsticks.</p><p>"So am I." Lia said as Matoko finished stretching. Glancing at  her brother and Mamimi she saw that they were dine as well. "Okay  you two. Bath time." said Lia as she got to her feet.</p><p>"Yaaaay!" Mamimi said as she bounded to  her feet, followed by a less -than -eager Christian.</p><p>"Yaaaay." he said. (1)</p><p></p><p>Naota snapped awake at the sound of the bolt being thrown in the  door. He lay on his futon feigning sleep as he listened to the sounds  of people moving around in he living room, the comforting grip of his  SOCOM filling his hand.</p><p>When Matoko scolded Christian to be quiet Naota relaxed and sat up in  bed. Looking around he wondered where Lia was for a moment before he  remembered that she had spent the night at the Saotome house rather  than the apartment.</p><p>"Baka." Naota scolded himself as he  shook his head. "Some demon you are, losing track of your mate."</p><p>Getting to his feet Naota stretched and  listened to his back pop. Calling forth a shadow he sank down into it  before rising out of a shadow next to the fridge.</p><p>Next to him the door to the fridge was open and Matoko was bent over  as she rummaged around for breakfast ingredients.  Christian and his shadow had the TV on and were watching some morning  cartoons.</p><p>Casually leaning on the door to the fridge Naota leaned over and  looked down at Matoko, who was still unaware of his presence.</p><p>"Hello Matoko." he said.</p><p>Matoko let out a squawk of surprise and nearly dropped the jar she  was holding as she bolted upright. Reacting purely on instinct a  small mallet materialized in her hand as  Matoko swung at Naota only to have her arm stop three -quarters of  the way there as Naotas snaked out and caught her by the wrist.</p><p>Matoko blinked as she realized that it was Naota standing in front of  her and not some mysterious attacker. Seeing the look of surprise on  her face Naota chuckled and let go of her wrist.</p><p>"And good morning to you too." Naota said as leaned over the door  to the fridge to snag a soda.</p><p>Recovering her wits Matoko frowned slightly and tapped Naota gently  on the skull with the mallet. "Bad Naota, sneaking up on me like  that." she said. "You scared me half to death."</p><p>Naota shrugged as he opened his soda. "Sorry." he said. "I  won't do it anymore."</p><p>"Thank you." said Matoko as she leaned over to rummaging around  in the fridge. "Is there anything you want for breakfast?" she  asked.</p><p>"Food." answered Naota as he walked over to the table. "I don't  care, as long as it's edible."</p><p>Seeing some vegetables she had put in the fridge after the last  shopping trip Matoko grabbed them and put them on the counter. "I  can do that." she said. Grabbing a few more items she stood up and  shut the door to the fridge. "How about Kenji?" she asked.</p><p>Flipping open a music mag Naota shrugged again. "As long as Kenji  gets his caffeine fix, he really don't care  either." he said. "Speaking of which, he needs to join the land  of the living." Naota added as he got up. "Excuse me."</p><p>As she started chopping vegetables Matoko heard Naota slide Kenjis  door open and go inside. By the time she was done Naota had woken up  his roommate and was herding him out the door. Putting the veggies  into the skillet Matoko paused as she glanced out of the corner of  her eye and got a look at Kenjis version of PJ's, which was like  Naotas it was a pair of sweats and no shirt.</p><p>What gave her pause was how Kenji looked bare -chested. She had seen  him bare chested before, during swim class in PE and she knew he was  skinny, but...</p><p>"<i>What  happened?" </i>thought Matoko as  she got a look at him for he was almost skin and bones with no muscle  on him at all. Seeing how gaunt he was she  went over to the fridge and got more ingredients out. <i>"Bre  was right. Someone needs to make sure he gets fed." </i>thought  Matoko as she started to chop more vegetables.</p><p>"Does anyone want tea?" asked Matoko as she put the extra  vegetables into the pan.</p><p>"I'm good." Naota answered, holding his soda can aloft. Kenji, on  the other groaned incoherently.</p><p>"Kenji says yes." translated Naota.</p><p>"It will be ready soon." Matoko said as she picked up the kettle.  Turning on the faucet she let it run for a moment before filling the  kettle.</p><p>After the kettle was filled she closed the tap, but not all the way  at first so the air that was in the pipes caused them to shake and  rattle for a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>Downstairs in the front of the shop Dokuhotei  heard the pipes rattle and looked up at Kamone. Nodding to each other  they picked up their phones and started dialing.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, upstairs Naota was blissfully unaware of the operation  that was unfolding beneath him as he read his magazine and drank his  soda. Kenji sat at his computer scrolling through his websites as his  brain reluctantly woke up while Christian and Mamimi watched TV and  behaved themselves.</p><p>Which was why Naota was keeping an eye on Christian. After years of  having Hideo as a friend had taught Naota many things, one of which  was 'if someone is looking innocent, they're up to something'.</p><p>That, and after the kite incident Naota wouldn't put anything past  Christian.</p><p>So he kept his eye on him, even when he got a fresh soda and tea for  Kenji, and even through breakfast. Thus when the phone rang he still  had his eye on Christian as he answered it.</p><p>"Bachelor pad." he said into the handset.</p><p>There was a chuckle as Dokuhotei answered. "Not after tomorrow."  he said.</p><p>Naota chuckled himself as he leaned against the wall. "Hey Grandpa.  What's up?" he asked.</p><p>"I have some boxes down here that need unpacked." Dokuhotei said.  "Think you and Kenji could get down here and lend me a hand?"</p><p>Glancing at Kenji told Naota that his friend was indeed fully awake  and his caffeine stream was in full flow. "Yeah, sure. Give us a  second to get downstairs." he said.</p><p>"Alright." Dokuhotei said before he hung up.</p><p>Putting the phone back on the hook Naota turned to his friend. "Hey,  Kenji. Get your shirt on." he said. "We gotta go give grandpa a  hand."</p><p>"Okay." Kenji said as he stood up. He saw Matoko in the kitchen  glance back at him. He blushed slightly, turned around and went  straight to his room. "I'm done." he said when he reemerged a  couple of minutes later.</p><p>"Cool." Naota said as he went to the door. "Lets go."</p><p>Matoko watched them go, waiting until after the door had closed and  they had started down the stairs to release the giggle she had been  holding in for the past hour or so.</p><p>Hearing his sister giggle Christian looked back at her. "Whats so  funny?" he asked.</p><p>"You'll see." answered Matoko as she sat down at the table as she  lapsed into a giggling fit.</p><p>Downstairs Naota opened the back door to the print shop and stepped  into the racket of the press room. Wincing  he folded his ears back against the noise and threaded his way  through to the front.</p><p>As he passed by Kamones station Naota  noticed saw that it was empty.</p><p>"<i>He must be  up front." </i>he thought with a  shrug. <i>"Oh well, if he keeps his mouth shut it'll be  okay." </i></p><p>Reaching the front Naota pushed the door open and stepped into the  store room, which was dark for some reason.</p><p>"Hey Grandpa, the lights out in the storeroom." Naota said as he  and Kenji entered.</p><p>"No it's not." Dokuhotei's voice came  from the front.</p><p>"Yes, it is." Naota shot back as the door behind him closed shut.  "Crud. Kenji, open the door. I can't see a damn thing in here."</p><p>"I know." Kenji said right before he tackled Naota.</p><p>"Ooof! What the-?" was all that Naota  was able to say before the lights flashed on and he got dog  piled.</p><p>Naota tried to struggle, but held himself back because Kenji was on  top of him and he didn't want to risk hurting him. So it was with  little difficulty that he was hogtied and hoisted up onto the  shoulders of his friends.</p><p>As he was lifted up he found himself looking at a grinning Evans.  "What the <i>hell </i>is going on?" asked an annoyed Naota.</p><p>Evans grin got even wider at that question. "Why, we're taking you  to your bachelor party." he said.</p><p>"My <i>what</i>" Naota deadpanned.</p><p>"Your bachelor party." Evans repeated as he tied on a bandanna  with an American flag on it , along with some writing in English.  "Now, sit back and enjoy the ride." he said. "Operation Valiant  Celebration is underway."</p><p>Naota groaned and rolled his eyes. "Bloody hell."</p><p></p><p>As Naota was bore out of the print shop on top of a mob of assorted  idiots, Matoko was upstairs laughing herself silly at what had just  happened.</p><p>Standing of the porch Christian and Mamimi  watched the mob thunder off in a cloud of dust and noise, then they  looked behind them to watch Matoko as giggled her brains out.</p><p>"Chris -chan?"</p><p>"Yeah?" he answered.</p><p>"Whats going on? Why is Ma- chan laughing?" Mamimi asked.</p><p>Christian thought for a second, then shrugged. "I don't know." he  said as he looked at her and shrugged again. "It must be an adult  thing, I guess."</p><p>Mamimi blinked as she thought about what Christian had said. "So  what do we do?" she asked.</p><p>Christian scowled and looked at his feet for a couple of moments as  he thought that one over. Reaching a decision  he looked up at Mamimi. "Spar?" he asked.</p><p>Mamimi blanched at Christian. "I cant!" she said. "Lia just  made me this new dress, remember?"</p><p>"So why don't you get a spare change out  of your pa-" Christian began before he remembered. "Oh yeah, you  didn't bring it." he said as he smacked himself on the side of the  head. "How about chi training?"</p><p>Mamimi nodded at that one. "Okay!" she said.</p><p>By the time Matoko had gotten over her laughing fit Christian and  Mamimi were already well into their chi exercises, so Matoko decided  to clean the dishes and tidy up the apartment a bit. In doing so she  discovered a lot interesting things.</p><p>Like for example, the fact that the broom closet was now a gun  closet. She also found a large stash of hentai manga and magazines on  a high self, obviously Hideos. After making a note to tell Naota to  move them before Lia moved in she continued on to discover many more  interesting things.</p><p>So, after she was done and slightly tired Matoko stood in front of  Christian and Mamimi.</p><p>"Are you done with your chi exercises?" she asked the pair of  neophyte martial artists.</p><p>"Yep!" Christian answered while Mamimi nodded.</p><p>"Well, lets get going then." said Matoko as she headed to the  door. "We have a lot of things to do today so we can get ready for  tomorrow."</p><p>Once they were outside and started walking, they fell into their  usual pattern: Christian in front, Mamimi  following him, and Matoko following up the rear. As they walked along  Matoko kept an eye on the two children so one or the other didn't  wander off or the other cause trouble.</p><p>As they walked along Matoko also noticed that Christian was brooding  about something. "Is something the matter Christian?" she asked.</p><p>"Huh?" Christian looked up at his sister.</p><p>"You look troubled." Matoko explained.</p><p>"Oh." Christian said with a shrug. "I was just thinking about  Lia."</p><p>"Oh? What about her?"</p><p>Christian scratched his head as he considered his response. "She's  getting' married tomorrow." he said, to which Matoko nodded. "That  means she's gonna move out, right?"</p><p>"Yes, she is." Matoko answered. "Is that what's troubling  you?" she asked.</p><p>Christian sighed and looked at the ground.</p><p>"Yes." he said. Lifting his head he turned around to look at his  sister. "Does Lia have to move out?" he asked. "Can't she just  stay at home?"</p><p>Matoko chuckled as she stepped alongside her brother. "I think  Naota would rather object to that." she said. "And it would be  inconvenient for the both of them."</p><p>"I still don't want her to leave." repeated Christian.</p><p>Matoko stopped and turned Christian around so he was fully facing  her. Squatting down sh got down on his level and looked him in the  eye.</p><p>"I  know Christian." she said. "<i>I </i>don't  want her to leave, <i>Ranma </i>certainly  doesn't want her to leave, Akane doesn't,  but we have to accept it." Matoko continued. "But  she wants this, and we have to support her."</p><p>Christians scowl deepened as he  listened to his sister. "But she'll be going away." he said.  "I'll miss her. The house feels weird when she sleeps over at  Naotas."</p><p>Matoko nodded in agreement. "I know.  It does." she said. "But, I'll still be there. Ranma and Akane  will still be there."</p><p>Taking Mamimis hand she put it onto  Christians and took the both of their into  hers. "And you'll have Mamimi there too. So you won't be too  lonely." she said as a sudden smile came across her face. "And  besides, I'm sure Lia will be making plenty of visits, for my cooking  if nothing else."</p><p>Christian brightened at that. "Oh,  yeah, that's right." he said. "Thanks  sis."</p><p>Matoko nodded and stood up, still  smiling. "Now lets get going." she said. "We have a lot of work  to do, and I want tomorrow to be perfect  for our sister."</p><p>"Okay!" Christian said as he hopped  over a crack in the concrete-</p><p>-only to have the water pipe under  the street break right when he landed and a jet of cold water erupt  out of the crack, soaking him. Letting loose a very feminine shriek  Christian -Chris -<i>chan </i>now-  jumped out of the water jet and landed next to Mamimi.</p><p>"C-c-cold!"  Christian said with chattering teeth. "S-s-so c-c-cold!"</p><p>"Chris -chan,  you're all wet!" Mamimi explained as took a look at the shivering  redhead.</p><p>Matoko, completely  nonplussed by what had happened, looked at her brother, shrugged and  folded her hands together. "Oh well." she said. "You were going  to have to change anyways when we got home so we could check the  bridesmaids dresses."</p><p>Christian slumped  her shoulders and looked at the ground. "Oh, <i>man.</i> Not  dresses." she groaned. "I hate dresses."</p><p>"They're not so  bad." Mamimi said as they stepped around the broken water pipe.</p><p>"But I'm a <i>boy!</i>"</p><p>"Not now!"</p><p></p><p>From his position  Naota had a great view of the sky overhead as the buildings went by.  All in all, it wasn't so bad. The only thing he could have did  without was the mob of idiots bearing him along.</p><p>Sighing he crossed  his arms as a billboard went by overhead. Looking to his right he saw  Kenji trotting alongside, his long legs allowing him to keep an easy  pace.</p><p>"Hey Kenji."  Naota said over the hubbub of the mob. "Where  we going?"</p><p>"I don't know."  Kenji said as he looked at his friend and saw Naotas expression.  "Cheer up. We're celebrating your last night of freedom and  bachelorhood."</p><p>"Thanks." Naota  deadpanned. "You do realize that I'm going to have to get you back  for this."</p><p>Kenji nodded. "Uh  huh." he said.</p><p>"Good." Naota  said. "As long as we understand each other."</p><p>Presently the mob  stopped and slowed down in front of a building that Naota recognized:  the Beer and Brawl, the most disreputable bar in all of Nerima.</p><p>As he was set down  Naota looked at his grandfather. "Ok,  grandpa. Why are at you and <i>his</i>-" he pointed to Kamone  "-favorite watering hole?"</p><p>Dokuhotei cleared  his throat and tried to took dignified and  solomn, and failed totally. "Well," he  began "It is totally fitting that we come here. After all, this is  where I met Genma and the contract between us was signed."</p><p>Naota looked at the  rotund martial artist and arched an  eyebrow. "They let him in?" he asked.</p><p>Genma growled and  tried to look solemn and dignified and did  an even worse job than Dokuhotei. "I am a master of many great and  powerful martial arts, not a common ruffian." he said before  Ranma belted him across the back of the head.</p><p>"You could have  fooled me." said Ranma.</p><p>"Likewise."  Dokuhotei said as he opened the door to the bar. "Now lets go  people. Naota's still sober, and we're  wasting drinking time." he said as the mob began to surge into the  bar, dragging a still -annoyed Naota with them.</p><p>"There will be  hell to pay for this." he said as he was hustled past.</p><p>"Oh, be quiet."  Dokuhotei answered. "You're just miffed that we suck  up on you." he added as he stepped into the bar and let the door  close behind him. "Now cheer up. You're getting free booze."</p><p>Inside the bar  there was surprisingly a lot people for it  being so early in the day, probably due to his bachelor party being  held there.</p><p>"<i>Oooh, I am so  gonna get them back for this." </i>thought Naota as he was pushed  up to the bar where Ryo, the barkeep  waited.</p><p>"Okay boys, what  it'll be?" asked Ryo.</p><p>Naota started to  say something but Evans cut him off. "Naota here is getting married  tomorrow, and to celebrate his last day as a bachelor we're going to  get him blind drunk so there can be lots of embarrassing  things to rib him about on his anniversaries."  he said.</p><p>Ryo blinked  at the word 'marriage' and looked at Naota. "Married" she said.  "You mean little Naota is getting married?" she asked, which made  Naota bristle.</p><p>"I am <i>not  </i>'little'." he growled. "And I'm two years away from the  legeal drinking age you know." he added.</p><p>Ryo tossed her hair  and drilled Naota with a deadpan look. "Do I look like I care?"  she asked. Her mouth quirked into a grin "Besides, I have your  father and grandfather to smooth things out with the inspectors."  she added.</p><p>"Dammit, can't we  do <i>anything legeal</i> in this family?" Naota asked as he gave  his parent and grandparent a glare.</p><p>"No." they  chorused, which got a laugh from everyone.</p><p>"So what's your  poison?" Ryo asked as she leaned forwards on the bar, a dangerous  glint in her eye.</p><p>Seeing that there  was no good way out of this Naota decided to go with the flow and  give in. "Everclear." he said, which caused Ryo to arch an  eyebrow.</p><p>"Everclear?"  she asked, doubt in her voice.</p><p><i>That </i>pricked  at Naotas pride. "I'm a Sano. I can handle it." he said.  Narrowing his eyes he crossed his arms and looked Ryo in the eye.  "How about you?" he asked.</p><p>Ryo laughed as a  chorus of 'oohs' rippled through the bar.  "I know better than to try and drink one of your family under the  table." she said as she pulled a bottle out from an under bar  fridge. "I lost plenty of bets to your father and your mother when  we kids that way." Ryo added as she  poured a shot for Naota. "Cheers." she said as she slid it over  to him.</p><p>"Cheers." Naota  echoed as he picked up the shot glass and slammed it. Smacking down  on the bar top he pushed it over to her.  "Now keep 'em coming." he said as a cheer went up.</p><p></p><p>Lia purred as  Mamimi and Matoko finished braiding her hair and tied it off with a  scrunchie.</p><p>"All done."  said Mamimi as she and Matoko stepped back to allow Lia to see their  work.</p><p>Unfortunately  Lia was in no mood to admire herself in the mirror, for she toppled  sideways and started to curl up into a ball. Glancing at each other  in alarm Matoko and Mamimi started shaking Lia to wake her up.</p><p>"No, Lia, you  can't take a nap yet!" Matoko said as Lia sat up with a 'nyaow'.</p><p>Lia turned a sleepy  glance at her sister. "Why not?" she yawned as she struggled to  stay upright.</p><p>"Because theres  something we have to show you in the dojo." Matoko said.</p><p>"Is there a  sunbeam there?" Lia asked.</p><p>Not for the first  time Matoko wondered just how much the curse and the Neko -ken  affected Lia. However, such thoughts could wait. There were pressing  things at hand.</p><p>"Yes, there is."  Matoko said. Which was the truth. Partly, anyways. There <i>was</i> a  sunbeam there, but not at that time of the morning.</p><p>"Okay." Lia  said as she got to her feet.</p><p>Grabbing her sister  by the shoulders Matoko guided Lia out of the main room and down the  hall to the dojo, with Mamimi trailing them out of habit. As they  walked Lia finally noticed that the house was apparently deserted.</p><p>"Hey, where is  everybody?" Lia asked, her brain still fuzzy from getting her hair  brushed.</p><p>Behind her Matoko  couldn't help but smile. "You'll see." she said as they reached  the door. Nodding to Mamimi she stepped aside to allow her to pass.  "Now close your eyes."</p><p>Lia closed her  eyes, and with another nod from Matoko, Mamimi slid the door open.  Guiding Lia forwards they walked a few feet into the dojo and  stopped.</p><p>"Can I open my  eyes now?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Yes." Matoko  said as she stepped back quickly, out of arms reach as Lia opened her  eyes.</p><p>"SUPRISE!"</p><p>With a hiss Lia  jumped a meter into the air and landed on all fours, wide awake now  and her tail fur standing on end.</p><p>Looking wildly  around at all the female members of her family and extended family  standing around her Lia tried to figure out what was going while  trying to suppress the instinct to growl  and hiss.</p><p>Finally,  she found her voice. "W-w-w-whatsss g-goinggg o-o-onn?" Lia asked  in feline voice, still in her defensive crouch. "W-whysss  everrrybody drrressed up?"</p><p>"It's your  bachelorette party Lia." Bre said as she  stepped forwards, dressed in full punk. Giving Lia a once over with  her eyes Bre shook her head. "And just wearing one of Ranmas old  tangs and panties will just not do for where we're going." she  added. Grinning Bre snapped her fingers. "Fortunately,  we prepared ahead of time. Grab her girls, it's time for dress up."</p><p>"HISSSSSS!" was  Lias response as she folded her ears back and began to back up.</p><p>Standing next to  Matoko Mamimi watched as a major brawl erupted in front of them. She  watched it for a few moments, then turned and tugged on the hem of  Matokos skirt.</p><p>"Am I coming  too?" she asked.</p><p>Matoko shook her  head. "No, you can't Mamimi." she said as she looked down at the  girl. "This is for big girls only. You'll have to stay here."  Matoko said as a panicked look came across Mamimis face.</p><p>"But I don't know  where Chris -chan is!" Mamimi said, her voice nearly cracking.</p><p>"I know where he  is." Matoko said as she knelt down and put her arms around Mamimi.  "I'll take you to her." she said. "I'll even carry you."</p><p>Mamimi nodded as  Matoko picked her up. Stepping out of the dojo Matoko turned and slid  the door shut behind them.</p><p>"We got us a  wiggler!" Bre said as the door shut.</p><p>Christian was  outside, with Genda, Izu, and Chisu, who had been assigned  babysitting duty. They were standing in the 'sandbox', an outdoor  practice area that Matoko used for her  kendo practice. Chisu had a bokken and was  demonstrating his katas to the others.</p><p>"See?" Matoko  said as she walked up to Christian, who looked up at their approach.  "He's right here."</p><p>Kneeling down  Matoko released Mamimi, who made a beeline for Christian and latched  onto her. Getting up Matoko stood over Christian and looked down at  him.</p><p>"You should keep  better track of your shadow, Christian." Matoko chided as she  brushed some dust off of her skirt. "Mamimi could have gotten  lost."</p><p>"I got  distracted." Christian said defensively.  "Besides," she said as she looked at Mamimi "You know your way  around the dojo, right?" she asked, which got a nod from Mamimi.</p><p>"Not with so many  people in the house." Matoko pointed out. "I'm going to go  change, so I can go out with the rest of the girls." she said.  "Behave yourself Christian."</p><p>"I will,  Ma-chan." Christian said as Matoko turned and walked back into the  house.</p><p></p><p>Gnawing  on a hot wing Naota watched as Ranma -chan stood on a chair and  recounted the incident in the dojo when Naota had just been turned  into a demon, to much hoots and catcalls.</p><p>"-And then the  door opens, and Naota turns around and gives Lia and Matoko the full  monte." Ranma said as Naota rolled his  eyes and sipped his drink. "They nosebleed and he turns beet red."</p><p>Naota shook his  head as everyone laughed uproariously. Out of the corner of his eye  Naota saw Kenji draining his beer.</p><p>"You okay Kenji?"  Naota asked. "You jealous?"</p><p>Putting down his  glass Kenji wiped his mouth and nodded. "A little." he answered.</p><p>That surprised  Naota. Kenji normally kept his feelings close to his vest, and never  showed them in public. Naota opened his mouth to say something but he  was beaten to the punch.</p><p>"What's this,  String bean is jealous over a girl? What's  this world coming to?"</p><p>Pushing himself up  on the bar Naota looked over everyones heads to see Takata grinning  at him.</p><p>"Hey Flagpole!"  he said. "Glad you could make it."</p><p>Takata laughed as  he shouldered his way through the crowd to where Naota and Kenji  were.</p><p>"What, me miss a  chance to get you and my little brother throughly crocked? Fat  chance." Takata said as he turned to Kenji and threw him into a  headlock. "Hey bro. Miss me?" he said as he gave Kenji a Hyper  Death Noogie(2).</p><p>"Gaaah!"  Kenji said as he flailed his way free of the noogie.  "I did." he added as he rubbed his scalp.</p><p>Takata laughed as  he waved at Ryo. "Hey Ryo." he said.</p><p>"Hey Flagpole."  answered Ryo. "The usual?" she asked.</p><p>Takata nodded as he  leaned against the bar on the other side of Naota. "So, what  have I missed?" he asked as Ryo poured Takata a Sunatory  on the rocks.</p><p>"Not much."  Naota answered. "Just a roast of me, starting with my so called  friends and ending with my soon to be father in law." he added as  Takata took his drink from Ryo.</p><p>"Thanks." said  Takata before he turned around to face Naota again. "Anything I  personally haven't witnessed or been a part of?"</p><p>"Just the time  when his fiancée' and her sister  walked in on him when he was naked." Hideo called out, which got a  round of catcalls.</p><p>Takata leered at  Naota as he sipped his drink. "Naota, you tomcat you." he said.</p><p>Wincing at the bad  pun Naota turned around to signal a refill to Ryo, only to see Asako  sitting on the bar behind him.</p><p>"Hello Naota."  she purred. "Having fun?"</p><p>Takata jumped when  she spoke and turned around. He gaped at Asako for a moment -she was  dressed in a low -cut black minidress and wasn't hiding her demon  traits- then gave a sidelong look at Naota.</p><p>"There something  you're not telling me?" Takata asked.</p><p>Rolling his eyes  Naota sighed and pointed to Asako. "Takata, meet Asako Kawashima."  he said as he began the introductions. "Asako, meet Takata Mashida,  Kenjis big brother." he finished, pointing to Takata.</p><p>Takata bowed to  Asako. "Nice to meet you." he said. "So, how do you two know  each other?" he asked.</p><p>Asako face broke  out into a huge grin at that question. "Well, you see, Lia, his  fiancee-" she nodded at Naota  "-patronizes my-"</p><p>"A- <i>hem."  </i>Naota cleared his throat.</p><p>Taking the hint  Asako caught herself in time "-shop." she finished. "I'm  advising Naota as he integrates himself  into local society."</p><p>"Ah." Takata  said with a nod. "Theres more to the shop thing, isn't it?" he  asked.</p><p>"Yes." Naota  answered. "And you'll know about it when I feel like it."</p><p>"Okay.' Takata  said with a nod as Asako narrowed her eyes and leaned forwards to  look at him. "Ah, can I help you?" he asked.</p><p>"Are you single?"  Asako asked.</p><p>"Married,  actually." Takata said as he held up his right hand and the wedding  band on his ring finger. "But its mind over matter. I don't mind  and she don't matter."</p><p>Naota and Kenji  both blinked and Asako grinned. "Hello." said Naota. "What  about your father, Takata? He'd blow a gasket if he found out." he  added, which made Takata laugh.</p><p>"Naota, now that  Kenjis out of the house, our dear old dad can kiss my ass." he  said.</p><p>"Here here."  Kenji said, raising his glass in salute which Naota and Takata echoed  as the clinked their glasses against his.</p><p>Once they had  finished their toast Naota signaled Ryo for  a refill. "So what about your wife?" he asked Takata. "You  gonna split from her?"</p><p>Takata nodded.  "Yeah. Once I figure out how I can get the kids." he said. "I  don't want to leave them with her, but her dad's a high profile CEO,  and I'm well, <i>not."</i></p><p>"Maybe I can ask  him nicely." Naota suggested with a grin, to which  Takata laughed and shook his head.</p><p>"Thanks, but no  Naota." he said. "He's actually a nice guy. He just has the  misfortune of his daughter taking after his wife."</p><p>"Nuts." Naota  said, snapping his fingers.</p><p>Takata shrugged.  "Anyways, that's enough of that. It's your bachelor party, and we  should be having fun."</p><p>"Agreed." Naota  said as Ryo set his refill down behind him. Picking it up he heard  his name be called off in another corner of the bar and waved in  acknowledgment. "And, if you'll excuse  me..." he said before stepping into the crowd.</p><p>Takata and Asako  watched Naota go, followed by Kenji. Turning to Takata Asako gave him  a questioning look. "So,..." she began.</p><p>"So...?" Takata  echoed.</p><p>"So, what is there for a married guy  like you and a fox like me to do around here?" she asked.</p><p>Takata merely shrugged. "I'm sure we  can find something to do around here." he said, to which Asako  grinned and swished her tails.</p><p></p><p>Heiji the  <i>disukujokki</i>(3)  had seen a lot of strange things since he had joined Saibapunku,  a lot of them caused by Hirofumi- the  owner, certified lunatic, and his best friend. But even this took the  cake.</p><p>A week before Hirofumi had told him  that the club/bar had been rented out by a pair of gaijin  for a bachelorette party. That wasn't so strange- they were a popular  club and they did their best to cater to their customers to remain  that way.</p><p>That the party was  from <i>Nerima </i>wasn't all that strange- as long as there was no  structural damage and they had permits from the Tokyo Police  Department's Cataclysm Division they were  allowed in.</p><p>But even this was  strange for Nerima. To start with the bride -to -be was a cat  girl, and was definitely an  American. Second was the fact that said cat girl was a hundred and  fifty two centimeters, had a C- cup, was dressed in a black silk  Chinese style dress with leg slits that went up to almost where her  thighs began, and was looking a little miffed. Third, and weirder  yet, the leader of this little band looked Japanese, but talked and  acted like she was an American and was dressed like a punk rock fan.</p><p>And the weirdest  part was the bishouen(4) with the womans  name who was with them.</p><p>Not that he was  going to let that get to him, of course.</p><p>"Welcome to  Saibapunku." Heiji said as he bowed to them. "You are the Saotome  party?"</p><p>"Uh-huh." the  punk girl said as she patted the cat girl on the back. "And this is  the lucky girl who's  getting hitched tomorrow, so of course we have to get her stone drunk  by ten o'clock tonight."</p><p>Heiji smiled and  stepped aside. "I see." he said as waved them in. "Right this  way please."</p><p>Inside the club Lia  gawked at the clubs decor, which instead of  the usual tube girders, spots, and displays it's decor was out of  clincher's China -a China with giant wall  screens and large speakers, but clincher's China nevertheless.</p><p>"Bre, what <i>is  </i>this place?" Lia asked, a little awestruck.</p><p>"A club." Bre  answered with a shrug and a smile. "Hideo recommended  it to me."</p><p>Lias tail kinked at  the mention of Naotas friend and resident hentai. <b>"He <i>what?"</i></b>she said in English. <b>"Are you sure it's safe?" </b>she  asked.</p><p>Bre nodded in reply. <b>"Oh yes, I'm sure." </b>she said. <b>"I  reminded him if it was a hentai -haven that you'd be after him.</b>"  Bre added.</p><p>Lia nodded as she looked in awe at one of the LCD mega displays  overhead. <b>"That's good.</b>" she said.</p><p>"Nani?" asked a bewildered Matoko. "What are you two talking  about?"</p><p>Lia 'eeped' and glanced back at her sister.  "Sorr, Matoko. We were talking about the  club, and how Hideo recommended it." she said sheepishly. "It  surprised me so much that I lapsed back into English."</p><p>Matoko nodded, then did a double take.  "<i>Hideo?</i>" she asked, a note of worry in her voice. "Are  you sure it's safe?"</p><p>Bre  nodded in reply as music began to play, low enough to provide  background for the party. "This way people." she said, steering  the group towards a large, circular couch sunk into the  floor.</p><p>Once everyone had been seated and  drinks ordered Bre stood up and cleared her throat. "Ahem. We all  know why we're here tonight." she began. "Our precious Lia is  getting married tomorrow, and we all know  that we have to make sure she is properly equipped to enter married  life, right?" Bre asked to a round of giggles.</p><p>Sipping on her drink Lias ears perked  up and she was instantly on alert. "Nyaow?" she said, keeping  watch out of the corner of her eyes.</p><p>So she was caught completely off guard  when she was pelted with several cat toys. Shaking  her head in disbelief  she picked up a to mouse and looked at it. "Cat toys?" she asked  as she sniffed the mouse.</p><p>Bre shrugged as she looked at Lia.  "Sorry Lia, we had to do it." she said.</p><p>"It's okay." Lia said as her eyes  crossed momentarily. "Woo, catnip." she said. Blinking she looked  at Matoko. "Or is it the alcohol?" she asked.</p><p>"I think it's the catnip." answered  Matoko.</p><p>"Okay!" a much happier and slightly  high Lia said as she looked back at Bre. "What's next?" she  asked.</p><p>"That would be my present." Bre  said as she pulled a large box from underneath  the table. "Open it." she said as she handed it to Lia.</p><p>Tearing through the wrapping Lia opened  the box to find two XXX- large hoodies, one  black and the other gray. The black one had  'demon' screen printed on it in English with red letters, while the  gray one had 'kitten' screen  printed on it in white letters.</p><p>"The black ones for Naota, and the  other is for you." Bre explained when she saw Lias puzzled look.  "That way if one of you has to go on a trip or so, you can take  each others hoodies and you'll have each others scents, so you won't  be so lonely."</p><p>"Thank you!" Lia said, lighting up  the room with her grin. "This exactly what we needed!"</p><p>"You're welcome." Bre said as she  sat down. "So, Matoko, I believe you're  up next?" she added.</p><p>Matoko nodded, then reached under the  table and pulled out a package, about twenty five centimeters wide by  thirty centimeters high and four centimeters thick. It was wrapped in  a creamy white rice paper with Matokos  elegant calligraphy in the upper left hand  corner.</p><p>"To my sister, protector,  and most importantly, friend." Lia read aloud as she looked over  the package only to discover that instead of being held together with  tape the wrapping was <i>folded </i>into  place. "This wrapping job is gorgeous." Lia said as she looked up  at her sister. "I don't want to open it because it would destroy  the beautiful job you did wrapping this."</p><p>Matoko smiled and  gave her sister a slight nod. "I don't mind." she said. "The  wrapping is like a cherry blossom: incredible beauty that is but  transient." continued Matoko. "And, like cherry blossoms it will  return."</p><p>Lia listened to  what her sister said, thought about it for a second and nodded.  "You're right." she said. "But I'm still saving the wrapping."  Lia added as she pulled one tab out and the rest unfolded, which was  another surprise because the wrapping was one whole piece of paper.</p><p>Murmurs of surprise  went around the party as Lia folded up the wrapping and put it away.</p><p>"Such skill..."  Nodoka breathed. "How did you do that?" she asked.</p><p>Matoko blushed  slightly and looked down at her hands. "Kenji helped." she said.  "He showed me how it would go over the book."</p><p>Nodoka  nodded in approval as Lia picked up the book that the wrapping had  been covering. "He'll be a good husband." she said,  glancing out of the corner of her eye at Matoko as a smile quirked  her mouth. "No wonder you cook for him."</p><p>Matoko gulped as her blush went from  pink to cherry red. Suddenly feeling very warm she grabbed  her drink and drained it in a couple of gulps.</p><p>Lia, on the other hand was looking at  the book that her sister had given her. It was bound in leather and  richly decorated, with the title picked out in gold leaf.</p><p>"<i>The Dance of Life: Basic  principals of chi manipulation.</i>"  Lia read before turning her astonished gaze on her sister. "This-  this- this is- do you know how rare this book is!" she stammered  out.</p><p>Steadied by the  surge of alcohol into her system Matoko  nodded. "I know." she said. "But you've always said that there  was more to chi manipulation, and I thought this might help."</p><p>Lia nodded as she  looked at the book in awe. "Thank you." she said with a nod as  she opened up the cover and a piece of paper fell out. "What's  this?" she asked as she caught it.</p><p>"An offer to put  all the things you've learned about chi on paper." Matoko answered.</p><p>"Hmm..." Lia  said thoughtfully as she put the paper back into the book. "That  has some appeal." she added as she (reluctantly) put the book aside  so she could accept the other gifts.</p><p></p><p>Genda looked up  when he heard the gate creak open and bang against the wall. Getting  up he stepped out onto the porch and hurried around to the front to  find a punch drunk Akane and Matoko carrying a semi conscious  Lia between them.</p><p>"Hey Genda."  Akane said as Genda made 'hushing' gestures  at her.</p><p>"Keep it down."  he hissed. "I just got Christian and Mamimi asleep an hour ago."</p><p>"Oh." Akane  said in a much quieter tone. "Sorry." she added. "Is Ranma  back?"</p><p>Genda shook his  head as he guided them to the side of the house. "No. He- I mean  <i>she </i>and pretty much everyone else are over at my parent's  place." he answered in a low voice. "Naota and Kenji are at the  print shop." he added as he looked behind them. "And where is Mom  and everybody else?" he asked.</p><p>Easing Lia onto the  porch Akane shrugged. "They're about an hour behind us -whoa!."  she said as she tottered and almost fell.</p><p>Looking at Lia who  was mumbling semi -coherently and Matoko who was fighting to just to  stay upright Genda scratched his head.</p><p>"How much have  they had?" he asked.</p><p>"Surprisingly,  not much." Akane said as she got to her feet. "Lia has her  fathers tolerance to alcohol and Matoko just hast built up a  tolerance. I'll get Lia. You get Matoko." she explained as she  pulled Lia to a sitting position.</p><p>Nodding Genda  crouched down next to his cousin and looped one of her arms over his  shoulder. "C'mon Matoko." he said. "Let  get you upstairs so you and Lia can sleep it off."</p><p>"I wanna stay wid  Lia." Matoko said, her words heavily slurred by the alcohol.</p><p>"Okay Matoko, you  can." Genda said after getting a nod from Akane. "You can. But  first we have to get you upstairs, okay?"</p><p>"Oookay." she  answered.</p><p>"On three."  Genda said as Matoko grabbed a post for  support. "One, two, three!" he said, standing up and hauling  Matoko upright on 'three'.</p><p>As he guided Matoko  over to the stairs Genda looked at Akane. "So, who's room are we  putting them in?" he asked.</p><p>"Lia's." Akane  answered as she half carried her daughter over. "She has futon,  that way if the roll out of bed they don't fall."</p><p>"Good idea."  Genda said as he began to go up the stairs. "C'mon Matoko. One step  at a time."</p><p>They made it up the  stairs with no further incident and deposited the bride to be and her  sister on Lias futon, after which Akane weaved her way to the master  bedroom while Genda went downstairs to get some shuteye(6).</p><p>Lying on her  sisters futon Matoko felt sleep fast approaching when Lia stirred  beside her.</p><p>"Ma-chan?" she  mewled.</p><p>"Yes Lia?"  Matoko answered.</p><p>"I'm getting  married tomorrow." Lia said as she looked up at the ceiling.</p><p>Matoko smiled as  she rolled over onto her back. "I know Lia. I'm your- your maid of  honor." she said.</p><p>With great effort  Lia levered herself up to a sitting position. "When are you and  Kenji -kun getting married?" she asked.</p><p>Matoko thought with  great effort for a few moments then looked over at her sister.  "When we're ready." she answered.</p><p>Lia nodded and  looked around the room for a second before returning her gaze to her  sister. "Are you gonna sleep with each other?" she asked.</p><p>Matoko blinked as  she considered the question. The fact that she hadn't lapsed into a  impression of an out -of -tune outboard motor showed how told her how  drunk she was. Lolling her head over Matoko saw her sisters head and  torso silhouetted in the light from the window.</p><p>"I don't know."  she answered, the alcohol making her bold.</p><p>"If you were with  Kenji -kun now, would you?" Lia asked as she struggled  against gravity.</p><p>Matoko looked at  her sister for a moment, then shook her head slowly. "No. It  wouldn't be right." she said.</p><p>"Okay." Lia  said with a nod. "Ma -chan?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes?" Matoko  asked</p><p>"I think I'm  gonna throw up."</p><p></p><p>End.</p><p>(1)After there was much rejoicing. (A)</p><p>(A) Three guesses where <i>that reference</i>  is from.</p><p>(2)Effective  only against him.</p><p>(3)Guess what <i>that  </i>translates into?</p><p>(4) Thats 'beautiful  man'</p><p>(5)Which is what Akanes cursed form looks like.</p><p>(6) Having decided that a house full of drunken martial artists and  at least one demon wasn't very appealing.</p>
