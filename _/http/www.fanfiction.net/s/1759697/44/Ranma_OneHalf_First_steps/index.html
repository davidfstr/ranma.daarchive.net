</div><p>1Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter One.</p><p>Lia was happily asleep and purring when her pillow moved. Her purr skipped a beat as she nyaowed softly and pulled it closer to her. Snuggling closer to the warm body lying next to her she happily returned to Morpheus' embrace.</p><p>It was a short visit as her pillow moved again.</p><p>"Lia."</p><p>She cracked an eye open to see that her pillow was in fact Naotas arm.</p><p>"Lia, wake up."</p><p>"Nnnhh...I was sleeping." Lia mewed as she curled up into a ball.</p><p>"Well, normally, I wouldn't wake you, but we a have a slightly bigger problem." Naota told her as he propped himself up onto an elbow.</p><p>"What is it?" Lia asked. "And why is it more important than my sleep?"</p><p>"Well, for starters, how about the fact that you and I are both in bed and <i>naked</i>?"asked Naota. "And the fact your parents are gonna kill us, me literally?'</p><p>"Oh." Lia said as she curled up tighter. "But I thought guys liked this sort of thing."</p><p>Naota rolled his eyes and flopped down onto the bed. "Not when the girls father can pound the guy into paste without even trying." he said.</p><p>Lia groaned as she uncurled and stretched lazily. "But you're a ninja." she said. "And a cat demon."</p><p>"Exactly." Naota countered. "A ninja would have to be suicidal to want to tangle with Ranma Saotome."</p><p>"mmm." Lia said as she rolled over and looked over Naota, who was partially covered by the quilt. "Hey, your stripes go all the way down." she said as she traced one with her finger.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said as he watched Lia trace the gold-colored flesh."I thought you knew that already. I mean, you and Matoko got a good look in the dojo."</p><p>"And you got a good look at me in the furo." Lia countered as she continued to trace Naotas stripes.</p><p>"Well don't forget it was <i>you </i>who surprised <i>me </i>coming out of the shower." Naota shot back.</p><p>"You win." Lia sighed as she laid her head on Naotas chest.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said distractedly, looking up at the ceiling.</p><p>"Something wrong?" Lia asked as she looked up at Naota.</p><p>"I was just thinking." answered Naota.</p><p>"About what?"</p><p>"About us." Naota said as he reached down to gently tweak one of Lias ears. "I just realized, everything s changed."</p><p>Lia sighed and purred slightly as Naota began to scratch her between the ears. "Naota, things have been different since the beach."</p><p>Naota tensed for an instant as the memory of the girl flashed before his eyes.</p><p>"Thats putting it mildly Lia." Naota said. "I know theres a few things that I wont forget about that place."</p><p>"Same here." Lia said as she levered her self up before straddling Naotas stomach. Leaning forwards she traced the patch of pucker d flesh on the right side of Naotas neck. "Though there is one thing that <i>I </i>won't forget."</p><p>Naota chuckled and reached up to feel the similar mark on the left side of Lias neck.</p><p>"Same here." he said. "But to get back to the original subject, what do we now? Where do we go?"</p><p>"I don't know Naota." Lia said as she rolled off of him. Lying down she propped herself up on one elbow as she looked at him. "But wherever we're going, we're going there together."</p><p>"So you wanna do like we have been doing, just let it develop on its own?" asked Naota.</p><p>'Yeah." Lia said. "Why mess with what works?"</p><p>"Good idea." Naota agreed. Tilting his head back he looked at his alarm clock, which read 7:15 AM. "And speaking of good ideas, you should be getting home."</p><p>'But I want to sleep, and you're nice and warm." Lia said as she scooted closer to Naota.</p><p>"I know.' Naota said. "But if you don't get home soon your dad is gonna come looking for you, and with us the way we are..."</p><p>"Oh." Lia said.</p><p>As Lia got up Naota patted her on the back.</p><p>'Don't worry." he said. "I'm sure there will plenty of chances in the future to use me as a pillow."</p><p>'Okay." Lia said. "Now where is my underwear?"</p><p></p><p>"Now where is it..." Akane muttered as she searched through the Sunday paper. "Here we go."</p><p>she said.</p><p>Pulling out the Arts section she laid it flat so the morning light fell on it and began to skim the columns looking for something interesting.</p><p>Akane was just getting into a column when she heard the front gate squeak open. Looking up at the clock Akane furrowed her brows.</p><p>"<i>I hope thats Lia." </i>she thought as she got up. <i>"And I really hope it is, because that girl has got a </i>lot <i>explaining to do as to why she never came home last night." </i></p><p>Getting up she stepped into the hall and walked to the mud room door to wait. As she heard the door open she frowned in thought.</p><p>"<i>I hope she fell asleep during an all -night Quake tournament." </i>Akane thought as the latch to the inner door opened.</p><p>The inner door slid open and Lia stepped inside and Akane immediately knew that was exactly the opposite of what had happened. Her hair was down and looking like it had been lightly brushed, and there was a twinkle in her eye.</p><p>"Hi Mom." Lia said in a sing -song voice as she bounced past Akane.</p><p>Akane blinked as she watched Lia walk into the main room,her tail swishing side to side. Sighing, Akane began to massage her temples. She had caused that glow in Ranma enough times to know what was going on.</p><p>"<i>Oh crap." </i>she thought. <i>"Why couldn't I have been right this time?" </i></p><p>Turning Akane headed into the main room after her daughter.</p><p>"<i>I hope Ranmas still in the furo." </i>Akane thought. <i>"If he sees Lia, he's gonna kill Naota." </i></p><p>"Lia?" Akane asked.</p><p>'Yeah Mom?" Lia answered.</p><p>"Are you okay?" asked Akane.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia answered. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>"Just wondering." Akane answered. "Why don't you go upstairs and change? I'll have breakfast on the table when you come down."</p><p>"Leftovers?" Lia asked.</p><p>"No." Akane said with a shake of her head. "Matoko made breakfast before hand last night before you left."</p><p>'That was nice of her to think ahead." Lia said as she started up the stairs.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane said as she went into the kitchen.</p><p>As she was setting the containers on the counter Akane heard the curtains over the kitchen door</p><p>rustle. Poking her head out she saw the main room was empty. Shrugging she went back into the kitchen.</p><p>Akane was setting breakfast on the table when Lia came back down in a clean over sized tang with her hair tied back loosely in a low ponytail.</p><p>'Lia, why are you in your sleep shirt?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I was thinking about going to bed after I eat." Lia explained. "I was up really late last night. That and in about an hour the sun's gonna be on my bed."</p><p>Akane chuckled as she and Lia sat down at the table. "You never could resist a sunbeam, could you?"</p><p>"Nope." Lia said with a shake of her head. "By the way, where was Dad in such a hurry?"</p><p>"Huh?" Akane asked.</p><p>"When I was coming out of my room Dad was going by." Lia explained. "He was using the Umi -Sen -Ken."</p><p>"I don't know." Akane answered as she began to dish up. <i>"Naota, you had better take after the Great White Ninja and run far, fast." </i></p><p></p><p>Naota was just out of bed and rummaging through the fridge for some breakfast when the doorbell rang. Closing the door to the refrigerator Naota walked to the door.</p><p>"I hope thats Kenji- Oh." he said as he opened the door to see Ranma. "Ranma, what can I -urk!" was all the Naota could say before Ranma grabbed him by the throat.</p><p>"We need to <i>talk.</i>" growled Ranma as he pulled Naota out the door. Tapping a few pressure points Ranma disabled Naotas arms and legs before throwing him over his shoulder. "So lets go somewhere quiet."</p><p>The door slammed shut as Ranma took off across the rooftops for the Saotome household, taking only a few minutes to get there with only a single splash of water. Landing in the yard Ranma dropped Naota like a sack of potatoes and stood over him, straddling his chest.</p><p>"Okay, Naota, I want to know <i>everything </i>you have been doing with my daughter." Ranma growled, flexing her fingers and showing her chi claws.</p><p>Totallyparalyzed Naota stared at Ranmas chi claws and considered his options. If he tried to talk his way out of this, she would pull the truth out of him. But if he told Ranma the truth, Lia would kill him.</p><p>"I'm waiting..." Ranma growled, leaning closer to him.</p><p>Naota sweat dropped as Ranmas chi claws came closer to him. "Well, uh, what happened was.."</p><p>"Yes...?" Ranma asked, her eyes narrowing to slits.</p><p>"RANMA NO BAKA!"</p><p>"DADDY NO BAKA!"</p><p>Naotas eyes widened as a pair of shapes appeared in his peripheral vision. He winced as the air rang with the sound of twin mallet strikes on Ranmas skull. Opening his eyes Naota saw Lia and Akane standing over him with mallets in their hands.</p><p>'You okay Naota?" Akane asked him.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota answered with a nod. "Whats up?"</p><p>"I think we should talk inside." Akane said as she looked at the crumpled form of Ranma.</p><p>Eyingtheir mallets carefully Naota nodded. "Ah, yeah, that sounds like a plan." he said. "Though could one of you give me hand? Ranma knocked out my legs with some pressure points."</p><p>"Okay." Akane said as she released her mallet back into Hammespace.</p><p>After undoing the pressure points Akane dragged Ranma inside to the table with Lias help. Sitting down with Lia and Naota Akane revived Ranma with a splash of water.</p><p>Ranma groaned as her eyes blinked open. Bolting upright she started to growl threateningly at Naota.</p><p>"Daddy..." Lia said sweetly as she hefted her mallet. "Be nice."</p><p>Ranma quieted down as Akane patted her on the knee. "Listen to her Ranma." she said. Looking at Lia and Naota she continued. "And I'm sure we'd both like to hear what they were doing last night."</p><p>Naota and Lia both gulped as Akane speared them with her gaze.</p><p>'Well?" Akane asked.</p><p>Lia glanced at Naota before speaking. "Well, you see..." she began as she started to blush a deep red "Naota and I, we...ah... kindofslepttogether"</p><p>"I thought so." Akane said.</p><p>Lias eyes widened as she looked at her mother. "What?" she squeaked. "How did you know?"</p><p>"Lia dear, if you were glowing any brighter I'd need sunglasses." Akane told her.</p><p>"Eep!" Lia said as she went from deep red to bright red.</p><p>"Secondly, and more importantly, did you use protection?" Akane asked, looking pointedly at Naota.</p><p>Naota saw the look in her eyes and gulped. "Y-y-yes." he stammered.</p><p>"So you planned it." growled Ranma.</p><p>"No!" Naota said as he waved his hands. "Not at all! My dad put them there when I was moving in!"</p><p>Ranma snorted and as Akane rolled her eyes.</p><p>'So how long have you two been been sleeping together?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Just once." Lia said in a small voice.</p><p>"Ah." Akane said with a nod. "Is there anything else we should know about?"</p><p>Lia and Naota looked at each other for a moment before responding. Getting a nod from Naota Lia was the first to respond.</p><p>"Well, I surprised Naotain the bath." she said.</p><p>"I know." Akane said. "I remember that."</p><p>"No, before that. Before we became friends. When I returned his notebook." Lia said.</p><p>"Okay..." Akane said. "Go on."</p><p>"We've also kissed a few times." Lia added.</p><p>"Thats not a big deal." Akane said.</p><p>'Ah, yes it is." Lia said. "The first time we kissed we almost...you know."</p><p>"I see," Akane said as she kept an eye on Ranma.</p><p>"Theres something else." Naota said.</p><p>"And that is?" Akane asked as Ranma scowled at him.</p><p>"Well, you see, you know how in a womans cycle, she's fertile for a couple of days?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Yes..." Akane said, not sure where this was going.</p><p>"I can smell that." Naota said.</p><p>Akane and Ranmas eyes bugged out when they heard what Naota said.</p><p>"You-you-you can smell when we're...?" Akane stammered.</p><p>Naota nodded and turned a nice shade of red himself as he looked at the table.</p><p>'Yes." he said in a small voice.</p><p>"Thats why we almost...you know." Lia said.</p><p>Ranma eye twitched when she heard that. Taking a deep breath Akane spoke.</p><p>"Okay... that was something I didn't know." she said. "Do you have any more of these surprises?" she asked.</p><p>Lia looked over at Naota before she spoke. "Well, there is one more..." she said.</p><p>'And that is?" Akane asked.</p><p>'Well..." Lia said as she reached up and flipped her pigtail off of her shoulder. "Promise you wont get mad?" she asked.</p><p>Akane nodded, and after an elbow in the ribs Ranma nodded too. "We promise." Akane said with a nod.</p><p>"Okay." Lia said as she undid the top buttons of her shirt. "Well you know how when demons take a mate they bite the neck?" she asked.</p><p>Getting nods from both of her parents Lia pulled her shirt away and turned her head to the right to show the bite mark.</p><p>'Well, we did.' Lia said.</p><p>Ranma and Akanes eyes shrank to pinpoints as they saw the bite mark on the side of their daughters neck. There was silence for a few moments until Ranma found her voice.</p><p>"W-W-when?" she croaked.</p><p>"At the beach." Lia answered.</p><p>Akanes eyes bugged out even more while Ranmas face contorted into a grimace.</p><p>"At...the...<i>beach!" </i>gurgled Ranma before she passed out.</p><p>Akane blinked twice and shook her head.</p><p>'So what made you two do <i>that?</i>" she asked.</p><p>"You remember when I had stepped on some glass?" Lia asked. "It was when Naota was carrying me back. I was trying to tease him and I accidentally bit him."</p><p>"And then my demon instincts took over." Naota added.</p><p>"So thats why Ranma picked up the change in scents..." Akane murmured. Sighing she looked back at the two teenagers. "How about you two take a break while I revive Ranma and make sure she doesn't try to go off the deep end?"</p><p>Lia and Naota both nodded and got up as Akane started to shake Ranma.</p><p></p><p>"Well, that went better than I expected." Naota said as he sat down on the floor of the dojo. "Thanks to you and your mothers intervention."</p><p>"You're welcome." Lia said as she sat down next to him. She was silent for a few moments before she looked up at Naota. "Hey Naota. I gotta a question."</p><p>"Yeah?" asked Naota. "What is it?"</p><p>"What about the contract?" Lia asked.</p><p>"What about it?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Do you want to go through with it?" Lia asked.</p><p>"No." said Naota with a shake of his head. "I'm not going to marry you because of that contract. I'm gonna marry you because I love you."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said before her face split into a mischievous grin.</p><p>Naota saw the look in her eyes and gulped. "Lia why are you looking at me like that-AAAAACK!" he said before he was enveloped in a Saotome Panda Glomp©.</p><p>"Oh my!"</p><p>Lia and Naota both looked up to see Kasumi and Matoko standing in the door of the dojo staring at them.</p><p>Naota grinned sheepishly as he waved at them. "Hi." he said.</p><p>"Hello." Kasumi said. "Are we interrupting something?"</p><p>"Ah..." Naota stammered.</p><p>"He said he loved me!" Lia purred as she squeezed Naota.</p><p>"AAACK! Air! Air!" Naota wheezed.</p><p>Kasumi smiled as she watched Naota try to wriggle free. Leaning over she patted Matoko gently on the shoulder.</p><p>"I told you I was right." she said.</p><p>Matoko nodded as she looked at Lia and Naota.</p><p>"Are you sure we shouldn't separate them? What if Ranma or Akane find them?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"It's okay. They already know-AAACK!" Naota said as Lia squeezed him again.</p><p>"We told them this morning..." Lia purred.</p><p>Matoko frowned as she looked at Naota. "Ah, Lia, you might want to let go of him. Naotas turning blue." she said.</p><p>'Huh? -oh!" Lia said as she let go of him.</p><p>Naota took heaving breaths of air as Lia sat up on his stomach. Stretching Lia looked at her sister and aunt.</p><p>'So, what brings you over here Kasumi?" she asked.</p><p>"I'm here to pick up Christian and Mamimi." she answered. "It's that time of year again."</p><p>"That time of year?" Naota asked. "What are you talking about?"</p><p>"Its Christians yearly checkup." Lia answered. "We bribe him with Kasumis cooking."</p><p>"Ah." Naota said. "And Mamimi?"</p><p>"Thats because Christians her navigator, silly." Lia said.</p><p>'That, and she needs a check up too." Kasumi said. "Apparently her nomadic lifestyle didn't allow for them."</p><p>'The price of being a Hibiki I guess." Lia said. Snapping her fingers Lia looked up at Kasumi and Matoko. "Hey, weren't you going to go shopping for winter clothes today?"</p><p>'Yes." Kasumi answered. "For the both of them. Mamimis parents sent her clothes money the other day. They cant find their way down the street but they can send her money with exact postage." she added, her tone showing what she thought of that.</p><p>"Oh, thats right, she has a bad sense of direction." Naota said as he tried to dislodge Lia. "Hey Lia, get off me."</p><p>"No." Lia answered, crossing her arms defiantly.</p><p>"I'll purr."</p><p>"Thats unfair." Lia said as she clambered off of Naota.</p><p>"Hey, I'm a ninja. Unfair is SOP for us." Naota said as he sat up. "Anyways, back to the subject at hand, I was wondering why Mamimis parents would leave her here <i>alone</i>?" he asked.</p><p>Kasumi sighed as she clasped her hands in front of her.</p><p>"The reason is her parents history with Ranma and Akane." Kasumi said. "They had several issues with each other. Ryoga, Mamimis father, wanted Akane, and Ukyo, Mamimis mother, had a marriage contract with Ranma."</p><p>Naota and Lia growled at the mention of the words 'marriage contract' as Kasumi continued.</p><p>"And when Ranma and Akane returned they settled their issues, and I'm afraid they weren't gentle in the way they did it." she said.</p><p>"So why leave her here?" Naota asked.</p><p>"The Hibiki family home is here in Nerima." Kasumi answered. 'It is the one place Hibikis show up at regularly."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said. "How has it been since she saw her parents?"</p><p>"About a year and a half." Matoko answered. "She misses them, but she has Christian, so she has a friend at least."</p><p>"Do her parents know that shes friends with Christian?" Naota asked. "And what will they do when they find out?"</p><p>"I don't know Naota." Kasumi answered. "But we'll know when they find out."</p><p>'I'll keep an ear out for the explosion." Naota said as he stood up. "So, do you think its safe to go back in there?" he asked as he helped Lia to her feet.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said.</p><p></p><p>The only sound in the apartment was the scratching of Kenjis pencil as he sat at his drafting table. He was confused, and was dealing with it the only way he knew how: his art.</p><p>He had stayed up until five AM that morning playing Quake. First with his friends, then he went on line and reaped fear and terror on the servers. Conspicuously absent from this had been Naota and Lia.</p><p>When he had finally gotten home Kenji had stepped inside a dark apartment. After kicking his shoes off he had carefully started walking to his room when he heard Naota start purring. That wasn't anything new, Kenji knew that Naota purred when he was comfortable or warm.</p><p>What made him stop was the <i>second </i>purr that started up seconds after Naotas. Kenji had cracked open Naotas door and had seen him <i>and </i>Lia lying in bed together.</p><p>Naked.</p><p>Kenji would be the first to admit that he was clueless, but not <i>that </i>clueless. He had shut the door and went to his room, where he had laid down and stared at the ceiling for the next few hours. Eventually he had given up on sleep and had gotten up.</p><p>A loud crash outside made him look up from his work. Getting he went to the window and saw that it was Hideo and Bre working on the scooter that they had found. Kenji chuckled as he saw Hideo dance around clutching his thumb.</p><p>Kenji was about to sit back down at his desk when the phone rang. Blinking he walked over and picked it up.</p><p>"Moshi moshi."</p><p>"Kenji?"</p><p>"Naota? Where are you?" Kenji asked.</p><p>"Lias." Naota answered.</p><p>There was silence for a few moments before Kenji spoke.</p><p>'Naota, whats going on with you and Lia?" he asked. 'Are you two more than friends now?"</p><p>"You could say that." Naota said.</p><p>"So Ranma knows about it." Kenji said as he walked to the kitchen.</p><p>"You heard what happened this morning?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Kenji answered. "I couldn't sleep."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said. "By the way, what time did you get in?"</p><p>"About five thirty." Kenji said. "I didn't see anything. You Lia were asleep."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said as three loud bangs came from outside the apartment. "Kenji, is there a firefight going on outside?"</p><p>"No. Hideo and Bre are working on that scooter." Kenji answered.</p><p>"Same thing then." Naota said. "Anyways, back to the subject at hand, me and Lia."</p><p>"You and Lia." Kenji said.</p><p>"How do you feel about that?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Well..." Kenji said as he thought about it for a second. "Its... Its a bit of a shock."</p><p>"You're telling me." Naota answered.</p><p>"But I'm okay with it." Kenji added. "And I know you had a good reason to keep quiet about it."</p><p>"Yeah. A whole school of reasons." Naota grumbled.</p><p>He and Kenji both chuckled over that for a moment.</p><p>"Well, its a good thing we managed to graduate then." Kenji said.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said. " 'Cause if this ever got out at school...oy."</p><p>"Yeah." Kenji said. "So everything s okay?" he asked.</p><p>"Uh-huh." Naota answered. "Every thing's okay."</p><p>"Good to hear.' Kenji said. "Talk to you later."</p><p>"Talk to you later." Naota said before hanging up.</p><p></p><p>Matoko hummed as she began to prepare breakfast for everyone. As she poured stock into the pot she felt a draft from behind her.</p><p>"Good morning Matoko." Akane said.</p><p>"Good morning Akane." Matoko answered. "Breakfast will ready soon."</p><p>"Thank you." Akane said.</p><p>"You're welcome." Matoko said. "By the way, when did Lia get home?"</p><p>"A couple of hours ago." Akane answered as Matoko spilled some stock onto the stove. "I assume you know something about this, being a sister."</p><p>Matoko nodded jerkily as she got a paper towel and wiped up the spill. "Y-yes." she said. "Bre went to check on Naota and filled me in."</p><p>"Ah." Akane said as she went to the cupboard and took out a tea mug. "I knew those two were getting to more than friends."</p><p>Matoko nodded as she picked up a bowl of sliced vegetables. "Lia confided in me about some things."</p><p>"Like her mating mark?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Like her mating mark." Matoko repeated.</p><p>Akane chuckled as she plucked a tea bag from its tin. "Ah, sisters. What would we do without them?" she said as she put it in her mug. "So, is there anything I should know about you and Kenji?"</p><p>Matoko sighed as she mixed in some chopped tofu. "No, nothing new there. He's still clueless as ever." she said. "I know he's interested in me, I can tell by his sketches, but I'm afraid to approach him."</p><p>"Why?" Akane asked as she waited while her tea steeped.</p><p>"I'm afraid that if I did, that I'd spook him and he'd run away." Matoko said as she picked up a seasoning jar. "We've been friends for over a year and he's still skittish around me."</p><p>"Well, he's not used to dealing with members of the opposite sex." Akane pointed out as she took out her tea bag. Tossing it in the trash she picked up her mug and took a sip. "Plus the fact he's always been the 'unpopular' kid. You know what thats like."</p><p>Matoko nodded in understanding as she put a quarter -teaspoon of seasoning in the soup. "I keep trying to forget." she said.</p><p>Akane nodded as she held her mug in both hands. "By the way, how is he? With being on his own and so on?" she asked.</p><p>"He's okay with it." Matoko answered. "But he's terrified of his father."</p><p>Akane looked up and narrowed her eyes. "Has he coming around?" she asked.</p><p>Matoko shook her head as she stirred. "No. But we were in the mall the other day and we saw his father and mother shopping." she said. "Kenji hid behind a pillar until they were gone and was jumpy afterwards."</p><p>"But other than that you haven't had any trouble out of them?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Not a thing." Matoko answered.</p><p>"Good." Akane said as she headed to the door. "I'd hate to see an 'accident' happen to them."</p><p>'You're not the only one." Matoko said.</p><p>Akane smiled as she moved the curtain to one side. "I know." she said. "Now if you'll excuse me, I have to see if your father has finished losing it and is willing to be rational now."</p><p>"Well, in any case tell Ranma that breakfast will be ready soon." Matoko said.</p><p>"Will do." Akane said as the curtain dropped behind her.</p><p></p><p>Naotas ears twitched when he heard a light rap on the door to the dojo.</p><p>"Yes?" he asked.</p><p>"You can come in now- where are you?" Akane asked as she stuck her head into the dojo.</p><p>"Right here." Naota answered.</p><p>'Where?" Akane asked as she looked around, even checking the ceiling. Arcing an eyebrow she continued to look around. "Lia, did you teach Naota the Umi -Sen -Ken?"</p><p>"No." Lia said as she blurred into existence next to the door.</p><p>"So where is he?" Akane asked.</p><p>'Right here." Naota answered her.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Watch." Naota said as the shadow under one of the cabinets lengthened.</p><p>Akanes eyes widened as a black humanoid shape rose up, then resolved into a crouching Naota as the shadow retreated back under the cabinet. She blinked several times then shook her head as Naota stood up.</p><p>"I leave you two alone for a couple of hours and you go and create a whole new martial arts technique?' she asked.</p><p>"It was Lias idea." Naota said as he walked to the door. "She thought it would be easier to develop techniques that can mesh with my Hagakure training."</p><p>'Ranma is gonna <i>love </i>this." Akane said as she stepped aside for them.</p><p>'Should we tell him?" Lia asked.</p><p>"One crisis at a time." Akane answered as they started walking down the hall.</p><p>"Okay." Lia said.</p><p>Ranma was seated at the table idly munching on some rice when he heard them come in. Looking up he gestured to the empty spots around the table.</p><p>"Come, sit down. Eat." he said. "Matoko decided we needed a proper breakfast and made us some."</p><p>Lia brightened at the mention of her sister.</p><p>"Shes back? I need to talk to her." she said as she looked around.</p><p>"It can wait." Ranma told her. "Right now there is something more important we need to discuss."</p><p>"Oh." Lia said.</p><p>They sat down and dished themselves up before Ranma continued.</p><p>"Well, now that you two have moved up to a more, ah..., <i>serious</i> level of your relationship, what are your plans for the future?"</p><p>Naota and Lia blinked and looked at each other for a moment. Seeing their confusion Akane clarified for them.</p><p>'What Ranma means, what are planning on doing in the near future?" she asked.</p><p>"Ohhh..." Lia said as Naota nodded in understanding.</p><p>"School." Naota answered. "We've both planned on going to college."</p><p>"For what?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Business Administration." answered Naota. "I'm gonna be working in family's print shop and eventually take it over, so..."</p><p>"And you Lia?" Ranma asked his daughter.</p><p>"Well..." Lia said cautiously "I was going to take teaching classes."</p><p>"Oh, so you can take over the dojo." Ranma said.</p><p>"No." Lia said with a shake of her head. "To teach <i>school</i>. I don't want to take over the dojo."</p><p>Hearing her words was like getting punched in the stomach for Ranma but he kept his composure.</p><p>"So..." he asked. "You're leaving for Christian?"</p><p>Lia nodded in reply. "Yes. He's so much better suited to it than I am." she said. "I mean, he picks up techniques like <i>that</i>." she added with a snap of her fingers.</p><p>Taking a deep breath Ranma nodded in agreement. "True." he said. "But you will keep practicing the Art, right?"</p><p>"Of course I will Daddy. Its part of who I am as a person." she said. "And I still want to teach, just not martial arts."</p><p>"Okay." Ranma said. "I can accept that. But there is another thing." he said.</p><p>"Whats that?" Lia asked.</p><p>"What about marriage?" Ranma asked. "Since your mated with each other, you're joined for life, from what I remember."</p><p>Naota nodded. "Thats correct. It's for the partners lifetime." he said.</p><p>"So get married would just be superfluous." Akane said.</p><p>Lia and Naota both shrugged in reply.</p><p>"Thats one way to put it." Naota said.</p><p>"So.." Ranma said as he leaned forwards "Do you?"</p><p>The two teenagers blinked as they considered Ranmas question. They looked at each other for a moment before Lia responded.</p><p>"Well, Dad, we really haven't considered it she said." she said. "But now that you mention it..."</p><p>"We should consider it." Naota said.</p><p>"Well, take your time." Ranma said.</p><p>"Please." Akane added.</p><p>Lia and Naota both nodded in agreement.</p><p>'We will." she said.</p><p>'Definitely." added Naota.</p><p>"Good." Akane and Ranma chorused. "Now lets eat." Ranma added.</p><p></p><p>"Have you considered just what <i>kind </i>of ceremony we'd have?"</p><p>Naota blinked and scratched his head in thought.</p><p>"Ah, no, actually." he said in response to Lias question. "I never really thought about it. But now that you mention it, I think I'd like a nice, simple wedding. Just friends and family."</p><p>"So would I." Lia said as she leaned against Naota. "But I meant what faith would it be? I mean, I'm Shinto -Buddhist and you're Catholic, despite whats happened recently."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said. "Well, we could have a double ceremony. One Buddhist, one Christian."</p><p>"That'll work." Lia said. Arcing an eyebrow she looked at Naota. "So you really want to get married?"</p><p>Naota shrugged. "Well, since we're already mated, I figured we might as well make it official." he said.</p><p>"So when do you want to do it?" Lia asked.</p><p>"In the spring? After we graduate?" Naota suggested. "That way we can have the ceremony and not have to worry about gate -crashers from school."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said as she snuggled closer to Naota.</p><p>"Well, lets go tell your parents." Naota said as La tightened her grip on his arm.</p><p>"Can it wait? I'm sleepy and theres a sunbeam on us..." Lia mewed.</p><p>Naota yawned as he realized that he was due for a nap as well, and the patch of sun they were in was just so inviting.</p><p>"Okay." he yawned as he leaned back against the wall.</p><p>As Naota and Lia were drifting off in the dojo Akane was finishing reading the paper. Finishing an article on some monsters rampage in Jubaan Akane looked up and was surprised to find the house dead silent.</p><p>Looking up at the clock she realized why the house was so silent: it was ten AM, or as it was more commonly known around the Saotome household, nap time.</p><p>"<i>I've been living with three Neko -ken influenced people for how long and I forget about nap time?" </i>Akane thought as she got up for some fresh tea.</p><p>The sudden ringing of the phone startled Akane as she waited while her tea steeped. She decided to let the machine pick it up and half listened as the message played before the beep. When Nabikis voice came on Akane hurried to the phone and picked it up.</p><p>"Nabiki?" Akane said after she pressed the 'talk' button.</p><p>"Hey Akane." Nabiki answered. "I catch you at a bad time?"</p><p>"Nah." Akane answered as she headed back into the kitchen. "I was just making some tea."</p><p>"So whats up?" Nabiki asked. "Anything new happening in Nerima?'</p><p>"Well..." Akane said as she picked up her mug. "You know that boy that Lia was engaged to?"</p><p>"Yeah." Nabiki answered. "What was his name? Naoya?"</p><p>'Naota." corrected Akane.</p><p>"Naota." Nabiki said. "Anyways, what about him?"</p><p>"Well it turns out he and Lia have developed feelings towards each other." Akane.</p><p>"How can you tell?" asked Nabiki.</p><p>'They slept with each other last night." Akane answered.</p><p>There was silence on the other end for a few moments before Nabiki responded. "Ah, you're joking right?"</p><p>"Nope." Akane said.</p><p>"Is this the same 'I hate boys' Lia that was a carbon copy of her mother?"</p><p>"Ha ha." Akane deadpanned.</p><p>"So what happened?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"As near as I can tell, Lia discovered that boys have their good points." Akane said. "That, and Naota isn't your usual hormone -overloaded hentai like you normally find around."</p><p>"Yeah, hes a trained from birth killer." Nabiki quipped.</p><p>"Not by his choice." Akane said. "Hes actually a perfect gentleman."</p><p>'Well, thats a plus." Nabiki said. "So, does Ranma know what happened?"</p><p>"Yeah." Akane.</p><p>"How did he react?"</p><p>"How do you think?" Akane asked. "He was about to kill Naota. Fortunately Lia and I intervened."</p><p>"Lucky for him."Nabiki said dryly.</p><p>"I got Ranma calmed down and we talked it over." Akane said. "We told them to wait before going any further."</p><p>"Do you think they listened to you?" asked Nabiki.</p><p>"Not in the least." Akane said.</p><p>'Well, look at this way: At least hes not like Ranma was." said Nabki.</p><p>"No, he's not." Akane said. "Though Christian is getting to be like his father when it comes to causing chaos."</p><p>"Oh lucky you." Nabiki said. "You could try your hand at managing Chisu for a day."</p><p>"Is he taking after Tatewaki?" Akane asked.</p><p>"No, me." Nabiki said. "And I think he's doing it legally too."</p><p>"Kami help us." Akane said as Ranma came in. "Well, I have to go. Nap time just finished."</p><p>"Okay. Talk to you later Akane." Nabiki said.</p><p>"Talk to you later Nabs." Akane said before she hung up.</p><p>"Nabiki called?" asked Ranma.</p><p>'Yeah." Akane said with a nod. "Theres a new photo in the printer for the album."</p><p>"Oh, thanks." Ranma said as he turned. Stepping into the computer room Ranma saw the photo and picked it up. "Okay..." he said as he looked at the photo.</p><p>Walking back into the main room he got out the photo album.</p><p>"What do you think?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I like it." Ranma answered. "I think Naota has discovered the dangers of  sunbeams."</p><p>"I thought you would." Akane said.</p><p></p><p>Lias ear twitched as she slowly woke up from her nap. Opening her eyes Lia 'nyaowed' as she looked around for what had woke her up. Looking up she saw the sun had moved up onto the wall.</p><p>'Nyaowing' at the sun beam for moving and interfering with her nap Lia laid her head back down and dozed for a few minutes before Naota stirred and woke her back up again.</p><p>"Lia?"</p><p>Getting a 'nyaow' in response he tried again.</p><p>"Lia, wake up."</p><p>"Nyaow..." Lia said as she stood up. "I was sleeping."</p><p>"I know." Naota answered as he sat up.</p><p>"My sunbeam moved." Lia said as she looked up at the wall.</p><p>"They do that." Naota said as he massaged some life back into his shoulder.</p><p>"Who wants tuna?" Matoko called from the kitchen.</p><p>Stepping out into the main room Matoko was surprised to see the two Neko -ken influenced and one cat demon sitting at the table. All three were purring and looking at her expectantly as she place the lunch tray on the table.</p><p>Their purring increased as they dug in.</p><p>'Sounds like a lions den." Akane said as she came into the main room.</p><p>"Thats 'cause I made tuna." Matoko answered.</p><p>"Ah." said Akane as she sat down.</p><p>By the time Matoko and Akane had halfway finished their meals the others had three helpings. Ranma smiled as he leaned back from the table.</p><p>"Ahh...delicious as always Matoko." he said.</p><p>"Thank you." Matoko answered.</p><p>'I don't know what we're gonna do when you get married and move out on your own." Ranma added.</p><p>'I'm sure you'll manage." Matoko answered. "You are a good cook all by yourself after all Ranma." Matoko pointed out.</p><p>"True." Ranma concurred.</p><p>"What about me?" Lia asked. "What about when I move out?"</p><p>"I'm sure we'll manage." Ranma answered. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>"Well, Naota and I talked about it, andwe'dreallyliketogetmarried." Lia said in a rush.</p><p>Ranmas response was to blink and look at his daughter with a vacant look on his face.</p><p>'Daddy?" Lia asked. "Are you mad?"</p><p>Ranma thumped his head forwards onto the table. "No, I'm not mad." he said. Sighing he continued. "Lia, why did you have to grow up?"</p><p>"I'm sorry Daddy." Lia said as she rubbed her fathers back. "I didn't mean to."</p><p>"I know Lia." Ranma said. "I know."</p><p>Putting down her chopsticks Akane cleared her throat. "So, when are you two planning to have the big day?" she asked.</p><p>"In the spring." answered Lia.</p><p>"After we graduate." Naota added.</p><p>Akane nodded as Matoko joined the conversation.</p><p>"So we have plenty of time to plan the wedding, right?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah.' answered Lia. "But we want a simple one, nothing fancy."</p><p>"I know." Akane said as she stood up. "But we still have to plan it, don't we Matoko?"</p><p>"Yes." answered Matoko as she smiled and stood up.</p><p>Lia blinked as her sister and mother looked at her and smiled.</p><p>"Nyaow?" she asked before they walked around the table to her.</p><p>Ranma looked up as Matoko and Akane each grabbed an arm and dragged Lia off into the interior of the house. When they were gone he looked at Naota.</p><p>"What have I got myself into?" asked Naota.</p><p>"The Saotome family." Ranma answered. "Better buckle up, cause it's going to be a wild ride."</p><p>"Help."</p><p>End.</p><p></p><p>Authors note: Heres a personal request for all those artists out there: I want to see <i>your </i>rendition of my characters. I've gotten a couple so far and I like seeing someone else's perspective on things. So go nuts! I know you're out there. I can hear your pencils scratching...</p><p>PS: If you want a reference go to my profile and click on 'homepage'.
