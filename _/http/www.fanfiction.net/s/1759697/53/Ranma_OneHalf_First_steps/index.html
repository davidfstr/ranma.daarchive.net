</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter Nine.</p><p><i>Holy Shit. Holy Shit and a half! It went over without a hitch! There was no really bad happenings and Chris-chan and Mamimi behaved them selves. And best of all! I got my dress! I'm pretty and girly! And I have a bunch of pretty flowers! Thats right I caught it! And now my Evans is doomed! But hes so damn hot in those class A's it wasn't funny! My Kitten was quite handsome as well in his tux and then his robes! It was so sweet. Lia was perfect! And now it is time for bed, too bad I don't have an army boy to share it with sigh</i></p><p>For almost the entire morning the house had been quiet as Lia and Naota slept in, and the shop below had been closed as well for 'personal business' according to the sign that Kamone had posted in the shop window. The sun had cleared the neighboring building and had begun to slant into the room about seven, slowly creeping down the wall and across the floor to where Lia and Naota lay together.</p><p>When the sunlight first fell on Lia, she murred in her sleep and curled up slightly. But the sunlight shining through her eyelids joined forces with her internal clock and roused Lia from her slumber. Cracking her eyes open Lia found herself in Naotas- no, <i>their </i>room, lying next to her husband and mate.</p><p>The memories of the night before came back to Lia as she languidly sat up and stretched. They had been up until almost four thirty in the morning, celebrating their marriage in their own, private, way. This brought a smile to her lips as she took in her mates form.</p><p>He was lying on his back, and Naota had kicked the covers off in his sleep so Lia had a full view of his body. He was like a sleeping tiger, seemingly a statue carved from muscle, the only sign of life was the shallow movement of his chest as he breathed.</p><p>Changing into a cross -legged position Lia took her pigtail and began to unbraid it. Once it was free of its braid Lia shook her head to loosen it up a bit, then got to her knees and leaned over Naota to get to the silver hairbrush lying on top of the low dresser that sat next to their futon.</p><p>The movement was enough to wake Naota from his slumber, and he stirred slightly and opened his eyes to see two of his favorite things: Lia, with her hair down.</p><p>"Morning." he said as he stretched.</p><p>"Good morning." Lia answered in a sing -song voice as she paused to watch a very interesting series of muscle movements.</p><p>Finishing his stretching Naota sat up on one elbow and watched as Lia went back to brushing her hair.</p><p>"Sleep well?" he asked.</p><p>"Mm -hmmm..."</p><p>"Me too." Naota said as he let his eyes wander up and down Lias form. "You're still glowing." he said as Lia continued to work her way  through her mane.</p><p>"And you look like the cat that caught the canary." Lia answered with a smile.</p><p>"Damn strait." Naota answered as he lay back onto his side. "So what do you want to do today?"</p><p>Lia shrugged as she finished brushing her hair. "Right now I'm in no hurry to get out of bed, I don't know about you." she said as she pulled a skrunchie off of her wrist and used it to bind her hair in the middle.</p><p>"Don't..." Naota said as she did that. "I like it down."</p><p>"Oh.." Lia said before she pulled the skrunchie back off.</p><p>"Thanks." Naota said as he wriggled closer to her. "Anyways, I want to stay in bed too."</p><p>"Good." Lia said she dropped the hairbrush onto the floor next to the futon, then rolling Naota onto his back. "What about breakfast?" she asked as she straddled Naotas stomach.</p><p>"Mmmmm... " Naota said as he took in every inch of Lia. "I think I know what I want for breakfast." he said, to which Lia bopped him slightly with her hand.</p><p>"Hentai." she teased. "My parents are too young to be grandparents."</p><p>Naota smirked when he heard that. "Oh, so thats what you're worried about." he said as he tapped the side of his nose. "Don't worry about it."</p><p>"So that's what you want to rely on?" Lia asked as she leaned forwards to look Naota full in the face. "And you mess up and we end up having kids?"</p><p>"So we end up having kids." Naota answered as he lowered his gaze. "What of it? It's not like we'd have a shortage of babysitters."</p><p>"True." Lia said with a nod. "But I'm going to be the one carrying the kid for nine months. That's gonna play hell with college."</p><p>"We'll manage, considering whats been thrown at us so far." said Naota as he looked up at Lia. "But theres a good chance that it could be 'kids." he added.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Twins run in my side of the family." Naota explained as Lia put on a mock -shocked expression.</p><p>"Oh, sure, you tell me that <i>after </i>I marry you!" she said as she grabbed a pillow and swung it at him.</p><p>Naota laughed as he blocked and grabbed Lias pillow strike. "Hey, it's not my fault my genes are the way they are!"</p><p>"Yes it is!" Lia answered as tried to tug her pillow free. "Let go!"</p><p>Naota smirked as he held onto the pillow. "I will not." he said as Lia tried to pull it out of his grip.</p><p>"Do it, or I'll cook!" Lia threatened.</p><p>Faced with a threat like that, Naota knew what he had to do. "You win." he said as he released the pillow from his grip.</p><p>"Yeeek!" Lia shrieked as she toppled backwards.</p><p>With a sudden burst of agility and dexterity Naota pushed himself up and forwards off the futon, so the he ended up kneeling over her on his hands and knees.</p><p>Suddenly finding herself in a compromising position Lia looked up at Naota and gave him a mock pout. "Hentai." she sniffed.</p><p>"Mm -hmm." Naota hummed as he shifted his weight and idly ran a finger along Lia's breast. "And tan lines." he commented as he traced the line between the light and dark flesh. "Smaller this time."</p><p>"New bikini." Lia answered as she idly trailed a finger along one of the stripes on Naotas bicep before snaking her arm upwards to scratch him behind the ears.</p><p>"right there..." he purred as Lia hit the sweet spot. Leaning down he kissed for several long seconds, to which Lia responded with purrs of her own.</p><p>"Do we have to go anywhere today?" Lia asked when they came up for air. "And are we expecting company?"</p><p>"No." Naota purred. "And no."</p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>Evans was nervous.</p><p>Well, he was trying not to be. But, its hard not to when your girlfriend caught the bouquet after a wedding. But he wasn't worried about <i>that</i>. No, he was worried about something a little more dangerous.</p><p>His girlfriend's little brother. Anyone who can pick a lock like it's nothing is someone you would be worried about.</p><p>But thats a problem he'd solve later. Right now he had more important things, like picking up Bre at her apartment. Shaking his head to clear his thoughts Evans mounted the last set of stairs to the story that Bre lived on and started climbing.</p><p>Reaching the top he turned right and walked down to her door. As he rang the doorbell Evans mouth quirked up into a smile as he saw that Bres name had been added to the nameplate on the door.</p><p>there were footsteps from behind the door, then a pause before the bolt was thrown and the door opened to reveal Dokuhotei.</p><p>"Hi Evans, Bre's going -" was all that he said as a squeal erupted behind him, followed by running footsteps.</p><p>Dokuhotei proved that even though he was in his middle sixties, he was still quite nimble as he flattened himself against the wall when his granddaughter charged through to nail Evans in a Panda Glomp(1).</p><p>"-to be right out." he finished as he smirked with amusement.</p><p>"Mmmf!" Evans said as he untangled himself enough from Bre so he could speak. "You missed me."</p><p>"A little." Bre answered as she rolled over and sat up. "That, and I also wanted to Panda Glomp you."</p><p>Evans groaned as he got to his feet. "Lia taught you that, didn't she?" he asked.</p><p>"Uh -huh." Bre giggled.</p><p>"Think I'll have to go fishing for Lias again." Evans said as he dusted himself off and looked at a smirking Dokuhotei. "You're enjoying this, aren't you?"</p><p>"Just remembering what it was like to be young." he answered with a twinkle in his eye. "You kids go have fun."</p><p>Evans shook his head as he helped Bre to her feet. "Is he always like that?"</p><p>"Like what?" Bre asked as she picked up a small backpack that she had dropped.</p><p>"Like he's knows what's going on inside your head."</p><p>"Yeah." Bre answered with a nod. "Lets go. Matoko's making breakfast for everybody doing cleanup." she added as she started walking.</p><p>"Oh, right." Evans said as he started after her. "That was a fun party last night."</p><p>"Uh -huh." Bre answered. "I especially like the gift opening." she added, a grin creeping onto her face.</p><p>Evans snorted in amusement as he recalled the incident in question. "Yeah, when Lia pulled the 'Weapons of mass Distraction' t-shirt out of the box, the look on their faces was priceless." he said. "I didn't know Hideo could run so fast."</p><p>"He has lots of practice running from pissed off women." Bre said as they started down the stairs. "Did you see Kenji and Matoko?"</p><p>"Yeah." Evans said with a nod. "They made a cute looking couple. Give 'em a couple of more years and they might actually get around to dating."</p><p>"They had better, or I'm going to lock them in a closet." Bre growled, which got a laugh from Evans.</p><p>"Speaking of dates, what're you doing after we get done with the clean up?" Evans asked as they hit the bottom level.</p><p>"Nothing. Why do you ask?" Bre asked as they turned into the street.</p><p>Evans shrugged and put his hands into his pockets. "I was wondering of you want to catch a movie at my place?" he asked.</p><p>Bre nodded. "Sure." she answered. "No horror flicks though."</p><p>"Shoot." Evans said with a snap of his fingers. "There goes AVP 2." he said. "How about Hitchhikers Guide or Sin City?"</p><p>Bre shook her head. "Nah." she said. "You have Enders Game?"</p><p>Evans thought for a second, then nodded. "Yeah, I do actually."</p><p>"Cool."</p><p></p><p>At the Saotome household it was a massive mess. The refuse of the party was everywhere, not to mention several large craters in the yard and one rather gaping hole in their wall, directly oppisite the living room.</p><p>It was also rather peaceful at the moment, the reason being that only the adults were up and one Christian Saotome was asleep at the moment. Said person was currently in his room on his futon, happily curled up next to his shadow.</p><p>He lay there, half asleep for an indeterminate amount of time before Mamimi rolled over in her sleep and brought him to full wakefulness Opening his eyes the first thing that Christian saw was Mamimi, her face looking like an angel as she slept.</p><p>This was lost on Christian as he blinked the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>"<i>Mi -chan." </i></p><p>The thought wandered through his head for a bit before being replaced with another one.</p><p>"<i>Breakfast."</i></p><p>Sitting up Christian rubbed the sleep from his eyes as he tried to remember what else he was supposed to do that day. Shaking his head he reached over and nudged Mamimi.</p><p>"Mi -chan, wake up." he said, to which Mamimi just groaned and rolled over.</p><p>Deciding that she wasn't going to be getting up soon Christian lay back down on his futon and stared up at the ceiling. As he lay there he thought about the night before, and that fox lady, and all the things she'd taught him...</p><p>"Thats it!"</p><p>Christian sat up again and shook Mamimi.</p><p>"Mi -chan, wake up!"</p><p>Mamimi groaned and tried to roll over again, but Christians gentle shaking was persistent enough to wake her from her slumber.</p><p>"What is it?" she asked as her eyes fluttered open.</p><p>"The thing we talked about with the fox lady." answered Christian.</p><p>"Oh." Mamimi said as she blinked. Sitting up she looked at him as she brushed a few strands of her hair out of her face. "So where is it?" she asked.</p><p>"I hid it outside. Christian answered. "In a public place."</p><p>"Okay." Mamimi answered as she stretched. "I'm hungry."</p><p>"Me too." Christian answered, a sentiment echoed by his stomach growling. Smiling sheepishly he got to his feet. "But I guess breakfast comes first." he said.</p><p>Once they had ate Christian and Mamimi set to work helping with the clean up of the house with Bre and Matoko, while outside Akane and Evans filled in the mallet craters while Ranma patched the hole in the wall(2).</p><p>That left Christian and Mamimi unobserved for about ten minutes, more than enough time for Christian to retrieve the two plastic- wrapped packages he had stashed earlier. Slipping into the Umi -Sen -Ken, he sneaked upstairs to Lias room, where her and Naotas luggage rested prior to their going on honeymoon.</p><p>With a surprising amount of skill for someone his age Christian had the packages rigged and the luggage put back into place in under ten minutes. closing the door behind him Christian snuck back down to the main room where Mamimi waited to implement the second part of his plan.</p><p></p><p>The sun was hanging low over the western horizon when Bre and Evans finally made it back to his place. It had been an <i>interesting </i>day to say the least, starting with Christian blundering into a stash of catnip and getting progressively weirder from there.</p><p>After the last hole was filled and the last dirty dish put away Bre went and changed into something more appropriate for Nerima in the summer: Shorts and a midriff t -shirt.</p><p>Evans immediately decided this was the outfit he liked best on Bre, for two reasons: (a) he got to see her tummy, and (b) he got to see her legs.</p><p>He also added 'c; he got a good view of her rear end' when she went in to the kitchen to grab some snacks Matoko had made for her and Evans for their movie dining pleasure.</p><p>This was noticed by Ranma as he relaxed with a glass of iced tea. As the curtains swished closed behind her he snorted and nudged Evans in the ribs.</p><p>"You're drooling." he said in a low voice.</p><p>"Huh- oh." Evans blinked as he was knocked back to reality. "Sorry about that."</p><p>Ranma smirked as he took a sip of his tea. "Just be careful Kamone doesn't see you." he said. "Theres nothing more dangerous than an irritated ninja father." he added, to which Evans snorted.</p><p>"Naotas the problem there." said Evans.</p><p>"Really."</p><p>Evans nodded after he drained the last of his lemonade. "Bre crashed at my place after a date, and the next morning I'm looking for breakfast and the next thing I know I get a .45 jammed in my ear." he explained.</p><p>That raised Ranmas eyebrows. "Really. I'll have to talk to him about that." he said as he looked at the level of tea in his glass.</p><p>"I got it covered." Evans said as he started to stand up. "I'm gonna have a talk with him when he gets back from his honeymoon."</p><p>Ranma nodded as Bre came back through the curtains with a Tupperware box full of what suspiciously looked like cookies.</p><p>"Talk to who?" she asked, having only caught the last part of the conversation.</p><p>"Nobody important." Evans answered as he stepped around the table. "You ready to go?"</p><p>"Yeah." Bre answered with a nod. "See you, Ranma." she said as she and Evans headed for the door.</p><p>"Have fun." Ranma answered as he poured himself some more tea. "And be back by midnight." he added, which got a 'ha ha' from Bre and Evans.</p><p>As they walked out Ranma leaned back and sipped his tea as he thought about what Evans had said.</p><p>"<i>Whats your game Naota?" </i> he thought. <i>"And why are you playing it?" </i></p><p></p><p>Lia yawned and stretched out on the floor of the apartment. She had the two basic things she needed: warm sun, and her cat demon, so she was <i>content</i>. Rolling over, she snuggled up to her pillow -which was said cat demon- and purred.</p><p>Under her head she felt Naota stir slightly as she rolled over, and she nyaowed at him softly to quit moving. Half asleep Naota mumbled something and lifted his hand up to scratch Lia behind the ears. She nyaowed again and snuggled closer to him, purring even more as she drifted back off to sleep.</p><p>They lay there for almost an hour, until the sun finally began to shift off of them. Hallowing, Lia sat up and stretched as Naota rumbled and rolled over onto his side. Cracking open his eyes he looked up at Lia as she stretched.</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>"Hey." Lia echoed as she lay back, using Naota as a backrest.</p><p>"Sleep well?" Naota asked as a twitch of movement at the corner of his eye caught his eye.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said as she ran her hand over his pectorals. "You make a good pillow."</p><p>"Thanks." Naota said as he identified what had caught his attention: the tip of Lias tail, which Naota found somehow very fascinating. "So, what do you want to do?" he asked.</p><p>Leaning back Lia shrugged as she draped herself over him. "Right now? Nothing." she said as she traced the edge of one of Naotas stripes. "Why? You want to do something?"</p><p>"Not really. I kinda feel like playing around with some chords." Naota said as he watched the tip of her tail go back and forth, back and forth, back... and ... forth...</p><p>"Oh? Cool." Lia said as she rolled forwards. "I like hearing you play." she said as she stood up. "Why don't you play some?"</p><p>Naota watched her get up and turn around to face him, the a -line t -shirt she was wearing making a very effective mini dress on her, her hair a cascading red mane. Seeing his expression Lia arched an eyebrow and cocked her head to one side.</p><p>"What?" she asked.</p><p>Naota chuckled as he sat up. "My t -shirt looks better on you than it does on me." he said, which got a smile from Lia.</p><p>Twisting his head side to side, Naota got up and walked over to his guitar, which was in its stand in the corner. Picking it up he plugged it in before sitting down on his usual cushion. Flipping on the amp Naota rotated his right arm to let the kinks out and flexed his fingers a couple of times.</p><p>Rotating his hand a couple of times Naota flexed his claws and started to pluck at his guitar strings, just running through a few chords to make sure his guitar was in tune and to warm up at the same time. One he was satisfied that everything was in order he began to play.</p><p>He began slowly at first, then began to pick up speed and complexity as he wove his song together.</p><p>Lia sat with her eyes closed as she listened to his guitar play, the music washing over her, seeming to go on forever. But after only a few minutes, it ended, the song echoing in her mind as opened her eyes.</p><p>"Wow."  Lia said as she blinked and looked at Naota. "That was... incredible."</p><p>Naotas mouth quirked up into a smile as he plucked a couple of strings. "Thanks. I've been kicking that around in my head for a while."</p><p>"Cool." Lia said as she leaned forwards slightly. "What else do you have kicking around?" she asked.</p><p>Naotas smile became a grin as he interlaced his fingers and cracked his knuckles.</p><p>"Let me show you..." he said.</p><p>Picking up his guitar Naota started to play, and play he did. For the next hour and a half he played, giving his mate her own private concert. When he finished they both sat there in silence for several minutes, the chords echoing in their minds.</p><p>The silence was finally broken by the rumbling of Lias stomach. Looking up at the clock she realized the time and grinned at Naota sheepishly.</p><p>"Hey, hows about some breakfast?" she asked.</p><p>Hearing his own stomach echo support for the idea Naota nodded. "I think thats a good idea." he said as he glanced at the clock. "Or is it lunch?"</p><p>Lia shrugged as she leaned back onto her elbows. "I don't know, or care, just as long as its food." she said, which made Naota chuckle.</p><p>"Well, lets see whats in the fridge." he said as he put his guitar back on its stand. Getting up, he walked over to the fridge and opened it to find it stuffed full of food with a note. "Heres a little something I made for you so you don't have to cook -Ma chan." he read.</p><p>"So thats what she was talking about." Lia said as she leaned her head back to look at Naota. "She mentioned something about cooking at the party, but I was too drunk to understand what she was saying."</p><p>"Well, we'll have thank her when we get back." Naota said as he started taking food out of the fridge.</p><p></p><p>Matoko sighed happily as she leaned back onto her bed. The cleanup was finally done, everything had been put away, and she had been able to take a nice long hot bath. Now she was going to lay back, take a nap, and then waste the rest of the day.</p><p>She didn't know for how long she had dozed, but the sun was setting when there was a knock at her bedroom door. Blinking a couple of times, she got up and answered it to find Akane standing there with a large cardboard box.</p><p>"This came for you." she said, hefting the box.</p><p>"My order!" Matoko said as she looked at the label on the box. "That was quick." she said as she stepped to one side. "Bring it in."</p><p>"What is it?" Akane asked as stepped into Matokos room. "And why did you have to order it from the U.S.?"</p><p>"Clothes." Matoko answered as she retrieved a letter opener from her desk.</p><p>Matokos answer made Akane pause for a second. "Clothes? They do you need to order clothes from America-" she paused as it clicked in her mind. "Of course. Height."</p><p>Matoko nodded as she pulled the invoice off the box and set to work on the packing tape. "Bre found me a company that made jeans in my size."</p><p>"Ah." Akane said with a nod. "What else did you buy?" she asked as Matoko pulled the flaps of the box open.</p><p>"Oh, a few odds and ends. Shirts, mostly." Matoko said as she started taking out plastic bags filled with clothes.</p><p>"Let me see." Akane said as she gleefully rubbed her hands together.</p><p>Matoko smiled as she finished emptying out the box. This was one interest  she and Akane shared: a love of fashion.</p><p>They also had another common area: Difficulty in getting clothes that fit. For Akane it was a gender bending curse, and for Matoko is was because of her Caucasian ancestry. Selecting a pair of jeans and a top, Matoko gave Akane the nod and she stepped out while Matoko changed.</p><p>When she was done Matoko called Akane back in. "So, what do you think?" she asked.</p><p>Akane, to it mildly, was surprised. Gone was the Matoko who usually dressed in button down blouse and a mid -calf skirt, replaced by a Matoko dressed in a midriff tee and a pair low rise flares jeans. Her hair had been pulled up into a high ponytail instead of being down like it usually was.</p><p>Nodding Akane answered. "I like it." she said. "You look cute." she added, which got a giggle from Matoko.</p><p>"I want to see how everything else looks." Matoko said as she picked up a shirt.</p><p></p><p>The smell of hot buttered popcorn filled Evans flat as Bre sat on the couch and flipped through the channels.</p><p>"Popcorns gonna be a few more minutes." Evans said as he puttered around in the kitchen.</p><p>"Ok." Bre said as she put the remote down. "I gotta go do something. Be right back."</p><p>"Okay." Evans said as he dug around in a cupboard, not noticing as Bre grabbed her backpack that she had been carrying and walk into the bathroom, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>Pouring the last of the popcorn into the bowl Evans headed to the couch, the bowl balanced in one hand and a case of soda in the other.</p><p>"Popcorns ready." he called out as set the soda down.</p><p>"I'll be right out." Bre answered as Evans set to arranging things on the coffee table. Opening the bathroom door she leaned against the door frame. "Oh Evans, can I ask you a question?" she purred.</p><p>"Shoot." Evans answered as he set up the DVD player.</p><p>"What do you think of my outfit?" Bre asked as she struck a pose.</p><p>"Well, I think it looks -guh..."Evans said as he glanced at Bre and his brain locked up.</p><p>The remote slipped from his fingers as he gaped at what she was wearing. The out fit in question was a black bikini, elegant in it's simplicity.</p><p>"Well?" Bre asked as she stepped out into the living room. "What do you think?"</p><p>Evans gaped a couple of times, then nodded. "I- I like it." he said. "It looks hot on you." he added, which got a giggle from Bre.</p><p>"Thanks." she said as stepped up top Evans and gave him a peck on the cheek. "I got this for the second half of the Kittens honeymoon."</p><p>"For Iowa?" Evans asked, which got a nod from Bre. "I can hardly wait." he said with a grin.</p><p>"I bet." Bre said as she stepped around him and headed to the couch. "Now lets watch that movie. I want to cuddle." she said as she sat down, patting the cushion next to her.</p><p>Evans blinked, then hustled over to the couch and plopped down next to Bre. Taking a couple of sodas out he handed one to Bre and pressed 'play' on the remote. Putting his arm up on the couch he made room for Bre as she snuggled up to him.</p><p>"<i>Oh, yeah, I can get used to this." </i>he thought as Enders Game began to play.</p><p></p><p>Lia purred as she lay curled up next to Naota, a fact which made Naota smile.</p><p>"You sound happy." he said, idly stroking Lia behind one ear.</p><p>"Of course I am." she replied. "I have you here all to myself."</p><p>"So I'm just a pillow to you, huh?" Naota asked in mock accusation.</p><p>"No." Lia answered as she looked up at him. "You're also cook, lover, sparring partner, and most importantly, mate." she added as she ran a finger along one of his stripes.</p><p>"Thats better." Naota said as he scratched Lia in the 'sweet spot' behind her ears. "You're just my whole reason for being." he said, a fact that made Lia chuckle.</p><p>They sat there like that for several minutes, just enjoying the silence and the feel of their bodies lying next to each other. Naota was just starting to drift off into another nap when Lia brought him back to wakefulness.</p><p>"Naota, whats it like?" she asked.</p><p>Blinking his eyes Naota glanced down at Lia. "What's what like?" he asked, not getting her question.</p><p>"Where we're going." Lia clarified "This town were supposed to be going to."</p><p>"Ohh..." Naota nodded, understanding dawning on him. "You're talking about Mabase." he said, getting a nod from Lia. "What do you want to know?"</p><p>"Just what it's like." Lia said as she settled her head in Naotas lap.</p><p>"'Kay." Naota said as he looked up at the ceiling. "Well, for starters, Mabase is literally my clans ancestral home. The Hagakure have been there for hundreds of years. We've survived demons, the betrayal of the Koga ,the Tokugawa's, World War Two, and the modernization of Japan." he began. "Mabase is a small town, it's in a valley in Mie Prefecture."</p><p>"sounds like a small town." Lia said. "Isolated."</p><p>Naota nodded. "You could say that. We're off the train lines, if that's what you mean. It's surrounded by forest, and not much of anything goes on there. Which is how we like it." he said. "Everybody knows each other, and we look out for each other."</p><p>"Sounds nice."</p><p>"It is." Naota answered with another nod. "I used to spend my summers there when I was a kid, playing with my cousins and generally having fun."</p><p>Lia smiled as she closed her eyes. "Well then, I can't wait to visit there." she said. "and meet your extended family."</p><p>Naota laughed as he got comfortable. "Oh, you will. And theres a lot of them." he said. "We Sanos are Catholic after all." he added.</p><p>"Don't you go getting any ideas." Lia warned as she cracked an eye open.</p><p>"I wouldn't think of it dear." Naota responded as he patted Lia on the head.</p><p>"Good." Lia said as she closed her eyes. "Now cuddle."</p><p>"Yes dear."</p><p></p><p>"Chris -chan"</p><p>Christian groaned and rolled over.</p><p>"Chris -chan."</p><p>Christian snorted in his sleep and rearranged himself into a more comfortable position, but remained stubbornly asleep. Mamimi sighed and looked at Matoko.</p><p>"It's no use. He won't wake up." she said as Matoko got a thoughtful look on her face.</p><p>"I have an idea." she said, and then whispered it into Mamimis ear.</p><p>Mamimi eyes grew to the size of dinner plates as she listened to Matokos idea. "Are you sure?" she asked. "It's okay?"</p><p>Matoko nodded. "It's okay. You're a girl." she said. "And we do need to get him awake so we can see Lia and Naota off." she added.</p><p>Mamimi nodded and swallowed. "All right, I'll do it." she said. "And I do it like Lia did, right?" she asked.</p><p>Matoko nodded. "Yes, like, but not exactly." she said. "Not all the way."</p><p>Mamimi nodded and rolled Christian onto his back. "All right, here goes." she said, taking a deep breath.</p><p>And kissed him.</p><p>It achieved the desired effect: Christian was instantly awake, waving his arms and thrashing about.</p><p>"Mi -chan! What were you doing?" he spluttered as Mi -chan turned beet red.</p><p>"Waking you up." Matoko answered as she rubbed Mamimis back. "We have to go see Lia and Naota off on their honeymoon, remember?"</p><p>Christian blinked, then sighed. "Shoot. I forgot." he said. "Sorry for yelling at you Mi -chan."</p><p>Mamimi nodded and Matoko clapped her hands. "Now lets get you two dressed." she said. "The newlyweds are waiting downstairs for you two, and we don't want them to miss their train."</p><p>"What about breakfast?" Christian asked as he got up.</p><p>"You slept through it." Mamimi answered, her face still crimson.</p><p>"I ..what?" Christian asked as he shook his head. "That catnip must have messed me up bad."</p><p>As Matoko got to her feet Christian started to say something, but stopped.</p><p>"Is something wrong?" she asked.</p><p>"Your clothes." Christian said as he pointed. "They're different."</p><p>"Oh!" Matoko said as she looked down at her self. "I ordered some new outfits. What do you think?" she asked.</p><p>Christian looked at his sister's outfit, which was a pair of the low rise flares she gotten in the mail the day before with a tank top that came to a couple of inches above her bellybutton.</p><p>"It's different." Christian answered. "But it looks okay."</p><p>"Thank you." Matoko said sweetly. "I'll be downstairs while you two hurry up and get dressed."</p><p>After Matoko had left the room Christian sighed and looked at his hands. "Now Ma -chan is changing too." he said. "Why do they have to do that?"</p><p>Mamimi was silent for a few moments before she answered.</p><p>"Well, my mom said that change is a part of life." she said. "And the only way to deal with it is to accept it."</p><p>"But I don't want it to change." Christian sighed as he got up. "I like it the way things are."</p><p>"I know." Mamimi said as she followed suit. "But I'll always be here. That will never change."</p><p>"Okay." Christian said with a nod. Pulling open one of the drawers on the dresser he tossed Mamimi a pair of overalls. "Now lets get dressed before Lia comes up here."</p><p>Mamimi nodded as she caught the overalls Christian had tossed her. Taking a quick glance at the calender on the desk they shared she also realized that today was important in way besides Lia going off on her honeymoon.</p><p>"Chris -chan..." she said.</p><p>Hearing his name called Christian looked up from pulling on his pants. "Yeah?" he asked as Mamimi pointed to the calender.</p><p>"It's a training day." she said as Christian groaned and plopped down onto the floor. "I can pick the outfit if you want..." she added.</p><p>Christian nodded as he started taking off his pants. "Okay." he said. "But nothing too girly."</p><p>"I know." Mamimi said as she walked over to the chest of drawers and pulled out the bottom drawer.</p><p></p><p>Twenty five minutes later the two children were dressed and heading down the stairs. Mamimi in a pair of overalls with a green t-shirt and Chris -chan in a yellow jumper with a white t-shirt. Mamimi had even taken the time to French brain Chris -chans hair so it would stay off of her neck.</p><p>"About time you two got down here." Ranma said from his position at the table. "And thank you for remembering to your training schedule." he added.</p><p>"Mi -chan reminded me." Christian answered.</p><p>"Well then, thank you Mamimi." Ranma said with a nod to her. "And now that they're down here, are you kids ready to go?" he asked, turning back to the couple of the hour.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota answered with a nod, glancing at Lia who was cuddled up next to him and purring contentedly.</p><p>"Well, lets go then." Ranma said as he started to get to his feet. "Akane, Matoko, it's time." he called out.</p><p>"Coming!" Akanes voice called from the far end of the house as Matoko stepped out of the computer room, slipping a USB key into her pocket.</p><p>"Where's everybody else?" Chris -chan asked as she looked around. "I'm not picking up Kenji or Bre or Evans chi."</p><p>"They're gonna meet us on the way to the station." Ranma explained as they began to walk to the door.</p><p>"Oh." was Christian's answer as Ranma picked up Lia's bag and handed Naotas to Akane.</p><p>The walk to the meeting point was uneventful, to say the least(3). So as they approached the print shop (the site of the rendezvous) they saw Kamone and Dokuhotei standing out front, with Kenji towering above them with Bre and Evans as well.</p><p>Ranma took a look at Bre and nudged Akane in the ribs to get her attention. Once her had it he nodded at Bre and arced his eyebrow. Akane took a look and nodded a confirmation back to Ranma.</p><p>"About time you guys showed up." Dokuhotei said as the group approached. "We were getting worried."</p><p>Ranma laughed as he ruffled Chris -chans hair. "We had to wait for a sleepy head to wake up." he explained.</p><p>"hmph!" Chris -chan snorted.</p><p>Dokuhotei chuckled as he glanced at his watch. "Well, anyways, if we get started now we can make it with time to spare." he said.</p><p>"Lets go then." Ranma said, pointing in the direction of the train station.</p><p>As the group started walking they split up into two groups: those over the age of twenty -one, and those under it, with Chris -chan and Mamimi in the middle where both groups could keep an eye on them.</p><p>"Isn't that a wonderful sight?" Kamone said, nudging Ranma in the ribs as he nodded at Kenji and Matoko.</p><p>Ranma merely grunted in reply, which made Kamone laugh. "What, no overprotective father routine?" he asked.</p><p>"Last time I did that I got Baka Bashed into next week by a certain tomboy and her redheaded daughter." Ranma grumbled, casting a pointed look at Akane.</p><p>"Thats because you were being a baka." Akane countered.</p><p>"Tomboy." Ranma countered as Akane stuck out her tongue at him.</p><p>"And I'd like to know why she's dressed that way." Ranma muttered as Akane rolled her eyes.</p><p>"<i>All theses years and he's still dense as a post sometimes." </i>Akane thought as she shook her head. "The reason is walking right next to her." she pointed out.</p><p>"Hmph." Ranma grumbled. "In that case those jeans are way too low for my taste." he added as Akane rolled her eyes.</p><p>"I think they look great on Matoko with her figure." Bre interjected. "And it's nice to see her in something besides a skirt and blouse." she added, which got nods of assent from everyone in the party.</p><p>Ranma just growled and looked at the ground. Shifting Naotas suitcase to her other hand Akane patted him on the shoulder.</p><p>"I know, you're not ready for your little girls to grow up." she said. "I'm not. I still want her to be that adorable little seven year old."</p><p>"Well, look at it this way Akane." Bre said. "With Naota and Lia married you'll probably soon have grandk-mmmf!" she said before her moth was covered up by Evans.</p><p>"Don't say it." he said as he removed his hand from her mouth. "S<i>he </i>might hear."</p><p>"Who?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Nodoka." Evans answered as he gave a look around. "She wants a horde of grandkids, and thinks that Lia should be a 'proper young woman'?"</p><p>Bre grimaced and nodded. "Oh yeah, that's a good reason not to say anything."</p><p>"Yeah." Evans nodded. "Definitely." he added as he gave Matoko a once over. "And I can't believe that Matoko decided to wear those clothes."</p><p>Bre smiled and gave him a light swat to the arm. "She <i>is </i>a girl Evans." she pointed out. "And we do like making ourselves look pretty. I mean, even Lia does, and she's a full on tomboy."</p><p>"True." Evans said. "And I think Kenji likes the new look." he pointed out. "He can't keep his eyes off her."</p><p>Bre laughed as she took a look at Kenji. "That poor boy doesn't stand a chance." she said.</p><p>"Yep."</p><p></p><p>"Attention, the No. 6 train to Shinagawa, Maibara, Mishima, Kyoto, and Oska will depart in ten minutes, please have your tickets available when you board. Again, the No. 6 train to Shinagawa, Maibara, Mishima, Kyoto, and Oska will depart in ten minutes, please have your tickets available when you board. Thank you."</p><p>Lia glanced up when she heard the announcement over the PA. "Well... that's my cue." she said as she looked at her father.</p><p>"You gonna be okay?" Ranma asked as he handed Lia her suitcase.</p><p>"I'll be okay Daddy." Lia said. "Don't worry."</p><p>"You know I can't do that." Ranma answered. "You're my daughter. I can't help it."</p><p>"I know." Lia said. "I'll call you when I get there, okay?" she asked.</p><p>"Okay." Ranma said with a nod. "Now get going, before you miss your train."</p><p>Lia smiled at her father and started walking to the train, but hadn't gone more than five steps when her father called out to her.</p><p>"Lia! wait!" Ranma called out.</p><p>"What is it Daddy-mmf!" Lia asked as she turned around and got enveloped in a bear hug.</p><p>"I'll miss you Kitten." Ranma said as he held his daughter close. "And I love you." he added.</p><p>"I know Daddy." Lia said as she returned the hug. "I'll miss you too."</p><p>Ranma smiled and let go of his daughter. "You got a train to catch."  he said as he turned Lia in the direction of the train. "Now go." he added with a swat to her rear.</p><p></p><p>"Attention, the No. 6 train to Shinagawa, Maibara, Mishima, Kyoto, and Oska will depart in ten minutes, please have your tickets available when you board. Again, the No. 6 train to Shinagawa, Maibara, Mishima, Kyoto, and Oska will depart in ten minutes, please have your tickets available when you board. Thank you."</p><p>The three generations of Sanos standing by the train looked up when the announcement came over the PA system.</p><p>"It's time." Naota said, his grandfather and father nodding in assent.</p><p>"You got everything?" Kamone asked.</p><p>"Yes." Naota answered with a nod.</p><p>"Call us when you get there." Dokuhotei said.</p><p>"I will." Naota said before he started off to his car.</p><p>"And remember, if Aunt Masami bugs you too much let me talk to her." Kamone called after Naota</p><p>"I will." said over his shoulder.</p><p>"Naota. wait up." Kamone called as he started after his son.</p><p>"What?" Naota asked as he turned around. "I gotta train to catch."</p><p>"I forgot to give you this." Kamone said as he took out an envelope and handed it to Naota.</p><p>"What is it?" asked Naota as he took the envelope.</p><p>"A do not disturb sign." Kamone explained. "You'll need it. Trust me."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said with a shrug.</p><p>Tucking the envelope into his bag Naota jogged over to the door where Lia was waiting and handed their tickets to the conductor. With one last wave to her family Lia boarded the train with Naota and took her seat. Stowing their bags in the overhead compartment Naota sat down next to Lia and sighed.</p><p>"Whew." he said. "We made it to the train and so far nothings happed."</p><p>Lia nodded as she looked out the window and waved at Chris -chan and Mamimi, who were standing with Matoko outside.</p><p>"And Chris -chans been well behaved too." she said.</p><p>"That's what I meant. That little kitsune has been extremely well behaved the past couple of days." Naota said as the train started to move.</p><p>Lia shrugged as she sat back in her seat. "Well, Mom and Dad did have a talk with him." she said. "and I did too."</p><p>"What did you say?" Naota asked as he draped his arm over Lias shoulders.</p><p>"I asked him be nice." she said,. "And behave himself." she added as she snuggled close to Naota. "He always listens to his sisters."</p><p>Naota blinked in surprise "He listened?"</p><p>"Well, Matoko was there too." Lia explained.</p><p>"Ah."</p><p>Closing her eyes Lia got comfortable and drifted off to sleep with her cat demon pillow as the train picked up speed on their journey to Mie Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Ranma watched as the train slowly pulled out of the station and picked up speed until it was out of sight. Wiping his eyes he felt something cold get pressed into his hand and looked up to see Akane standing next to him.</p><p>"Here's some water if you want to change." she said quietly.</p><p>"I'm okay." Ranma said with a shake of his head. "But thanks anyways. I'm just a father who just saw his daughter off on her honeymoon."</p><p>Akane chuckled and nodded. "I see." she said as she looked at their other two children. "So what are you going to do when it's Matoko and Christian's turns?" she asked.</p><p>"Probably the same damn thing." Ranma said with a sniffle.</p><p>Akane laughed as they started towards where Matoko, Christian, Kenji, and Mamimi were gathered.</p><p>"We're heading home. Anyone want to stop somewhere for a snack?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Ice cream?" Christian and Mamimi asked.</p><p>"Sure." Ranma said, then looked at Kenji and Matoko. "How about you two?" he asked.</p><p>"Ah, can't." Kenji answered. "Matoko and I have some stuff to catch up on."</p><p>"Okay." Akane said. "But remember to eat, you two. I know you're both incredibly creative, but you gotta keep your imaginations fed."</p><p>"We will." Matoko said as the both bowed to Akane and Ranma.</p><p>"Good." Ranma said. "Now go have fun." he said.</p><p>As the pair of them headed out Ranma leaned over to Akane. "We had better have Bre stop by just in case." he said. "You know how drifty those two are."</p><p>"Good idea." Akane nodded. "I wonder if she's in the mood for ice cream?" she asked.</p><p>"Lets ask." Ranma suggested. "Hey Bre," he called. "You want to go for ice cream?"</p><p>"Sure." Bre answered.</p><p>"Ditto." Evans answered.</p><p>"Lets go then." Ranma said as Bre and Evans came over to them.</p><p>"Matoko and Kenji aren't joining us?" Bre asked as they walked along.</p><p>"No." Akane said with a shake of her head. "They're off being creative."</p><p>"Ah." Bre said with a nod of her head.</p><p>"And on that note," Ranma interjected. "Could you two stop in later and make sure that they remembered to eat?" he asked.</p><p>"Sure." Bre said with a nod.</p><p>"Thank you." Ranma said as they stepped out into the street. "Now I don't know about you guys, but seeing Lia off on her honeymoon has put me in the mood for a sundae."</p><p>"Me too." Akane said, a sentiment which was echoed by the other members of the group.</p><p>"Lets go then." Ranma said, pointing in the direction of the ice cream shop.</p><p></p><p>Authors note: I apologize for the lateness of my update, but I had a lot of things happen at the end of November -beginning of December. The most major of those things was an accident. Long story short, I ran a stop sign and got into a fender bender</p><p>That, coupled with a nasty bout of depression totally killed my writing so I left it sitting, so to speak. Fortunately</p><p>my beta reader, known to you my loyal readers as Little Gypsy Girl, gave me a metaphorical mallet to the noggin and got me writing again.</p><p>Thank you for your patience, and I hope you enjoyed the story. There will be much more to come.</p><p></p><p>End.</p><p>Lia taught her that one, very useful for greeting boyfriends.</p><p>(2)One of the skills you pick up as a Saotome is masonry.</p><p>(3) Which for Nerima is a flat out miracle</p>
