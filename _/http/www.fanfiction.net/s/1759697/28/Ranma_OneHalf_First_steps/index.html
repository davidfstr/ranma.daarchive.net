</div><p>1Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book three.</p><p>Chapter 8.</p><p>"We're home!" Lia called as she and matoko entered the house.</p><p>"How was school?" Ranma asked from the living room.</p><p>"The usual. Lots of rumors and gossip about me an' Naota." Lia answered as she came in. "Whats that smell?"</p><p>"What smell?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"That smell." Lia said.</p><p>"It smells like laundry." Matoko added. "Really hot laundry."</p><p>"Really hot laundry..." Ranma said. "THE DRYER!"</p><p>Jumping to his feet Ranma ran to the laundry room and threw the door open, nearly knocking it off it's track. White smoke billowed out of the laundry room as he ducked inside. Coughing in the smoke Ranma reached out and shut the dryer off.</p><p>"What's going on?" Lia asked as she looked in the laundry room.</p><p>Opening the dryer door Ranma jumped back as flames burst leapt out the door.</p><p>"Yaaah! Fire!" Ranma yelled as he kicked the door shut.</p><p>"I'll get a fire extinguisher" Lia yelled as she tore off down the hall to kitchen.</p><p>"There's no time!" Ranma yelled as he picked up the dryer. "Make a hole!" he yelled.</p><p>Not bothering to mind the door or the walls Ranma shoved the dryer through the door and down the hall. Matoko scrambled backwards down the hall and ducked out of the way when she reached the living room.</p><p>Running to the open patio doors Ranma threw the smoking dryer into the yard as Lia came out of the kitchen with the fire extinguisher.</p><p>"Too late." Lia said as she saw the dryer lying in the yard.</p><p>Blowing on his hands Ranma looked at Lia.</p><p>"Lia, go check the laundry room." he said.</p><p>"Okay." Lia said as she turned to walk away.</p><p>"I'll get the first aid kit." Matoko said as she got up.</p><p>"Thanks Matoko." Ranma said.</p><p>Ranma watched the dryer smoulder as Matoko left the room. Blowing on his hands realized how close they had came to a castrophe.</p><p>"<i>Good thing we caught that in time." </i>he thought. <i>"If it had gotten any farther this place would have went up like a Roman candle." </i></p><p>"Ranma, why is the dryer on fire in the yard?" Akanes voice came in from the mud room.</p><p>"I think old age finally caught up with it." Ranma said.</p><p>"We'll have to tell Kasumi." Akane said as she and Nodoka. "She loved that machine."</p><p>"That she did." Ranma said. "Hi mom."</p><p>"Hello son." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Where's Pops?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Out getting drunk with Soun." Nodoka answered. "I decided to come and cook dinner for you."</p><p>"Thank you." Ranma said as Lia came in with the fire extinguisher.</p><p>"The laundry rooms okay." Lia said.</p><p>"What was in the dryer?" Akane asked.</p><p>Ranma winced as he recalled what was now going up in smoke in the dryer.</p><p>"Underwear." Ranma groaned. "Both of the girls and Christians."</p><p>"We have some left, right?" Lia asked.</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "No. I put it all in the last load."</p><p>"You mean I have no clean underwear?" Lia asked.</p><p>"I mean you have no underwear <i>left."</i> Ranma corrected.</p><p>"Crap!" Lia said as she stomped her foot.</p><p>"Tomorrow's Sunday Lia." Akane said. "You buy new pairs tomorrow."</p><p>"I can't!" Lia said as she turned to face Akane.</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Matoko and I are going to the movies tomorrow with Naota and Kenji tomorrow, remember?" Lia told her. "I just said that out loud, didn't I?" she asked.</p><p>"How romantic!" Nodoka said as Akane and Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Hello Nodoka." Matoko said as she came in with the first aid kit. "I have the first aid kit." she said.</p><p>"Thank you." Ranma said as he sat down at the table.</p><p>"Nodoka okay?" Matoko asked.</p><p>Ranma glanced at his mother, who had a faraway look on her face.</p><p>"Oh, Lia mentioned you're going to the movies tomorrow." Ranma said.</p><p>"Oh." Matoko said.</p><p>"That reminds me, when your done we have to go shopping." Lia said. "All our underwear was in the dryer."</p><p>"Oh." Matoko said as she checked Ranmas hands. "My bras were getting too small anyways."</p><p>Lia shrugged her backpack on as she and Matoko stepped out the front door.</p><p>"Whats the big deal about me carrying a backpack instead of a purse anyways?" Lia asked.</p><p>Matoko shrugged. "I don't know Lia. You know how old fashioned she is."</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said as she nodded.</p><p>As they stepped out the gate they ran into Christian and Mamimi.</p><p>"Hi Christian." Lia said. "Hi Mamimi."</p><p>"Hi Lia. You going somewhere?" Christian asked.</p><p>"Shopping."Lia answered. "There was a dryer accident and all our underwear went up in smoke."</p><p>"Oh." Christian said with a shrug.</p><p>Stepping past his sister Christian and Mamimi began to walk to the gate.</p><p>"Grandma is in there." Lia called after him.</p><p>Christian and Mamimi froze. Turning around they headed right back to Lia and Matoko. Lia chuckled as the came up to them.</p><p>"Can we tag along?" Christian asked. "Mamimi and I don't want to play dress up."</p><p>"Sure." Lia answered.</p><p>Christian and Matoko stood and waited while Lia and Matoko browsed. He kept his eyes on the floor and did his best to keep his ears from burning. Mamimi stood next to him holding onto his shoulder while looking in awe at the store.</p><p>"I didn't know this place was so <i>big." </i>Mamimi said.</p><p>"Uh -huh." Christian replied.</p><p>"I didn't know you could put so much stuff in one place." Mamimi continued.</p><p>"Yeah." Christian said.</p><p>Mamimi looked at her friend. "Are you all right Chris-chan?" she asked.</p><p>"I'm fine." Christian said. "It's just where we're standing."</p><p>"Whats wrong with where we are?" Mamimi asked. "It's only underwear."</p><p>"It's women's underwear." Christian said.</p><p>"But you are a girl, Chris -chan." Mamimi said, tugging on Christians ponytail. "It's okay for you be here."</p><p>"But I'm still a boy." Christian said. "Even though I'm a girl."</p><p>Blinking Christian looked up and took a look around the store.</p><p>"Did I just say that?"</p><p>"You did." Mamimi said.</p><p>Having gotten all the underwear they needed Lia and Matoko moved on to bras, Christian and Mamimi following behind. Finding the size she needed Lia loaded up on sports bras and added them to her total.</p><p>"We can meet up at checkout." Lia said to Matoko as she turned to Christian. "I have to shop for Christian."</p><p>"See you there." Matoko said.</p><p>"Lets go Christian." Lia said.</p><p>As they headed to the children's section Mamimi reached out and tugged at Lias shirttail.</p><p>"Yes Mamimi?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Would it be alright if I did some shopping too?" Mamimi asked. "I need to buy new clothes and this is the first time I've been in a store for a while."</p><p>"Sure." Lia said. "I'll help guide you around."</p><p>"Thank you." Mamimi answered.</p><p>"You can wait with Matoko." Lia told Christian.</p><p>"No thanks." Christian answered. "I've seen enough bras and panties to last me a lifetime."</p><p>"Your choice." Lia answered.</p><p>Christian chuckled as he fell in behind them. "Besides, I've been keeping track of what you bought so I can tell your boyfriend." he said.</p><p>Lias eyes bugged out and her right ear twitched. Stopping in her tracks she turned and grabbed her brother by the collar.</p><p>"Thats it! You just got your self a new outfit, <i>Chris -chan."</i> Lia growled. "Lets go Mamimi." she said.</p><p>"Hey leggo!" Christian said as they approached the children's section. "Lia! This isn't funny!"</p><p>Matoko looked up as she heard her brother and saw what was going on. Shaking her head she went back to her shopping.</p><p>"Liaaaaaaaa!" Christian wailed as they entered the children's section.</p><p>Two hours later the streetlights were beginning to come on when they left the store. Turning they began to wander home, munching on snacks that they had bought.</p><p>"This sucks." Christian grumbled.</p><p>"It's not so bad." Mamimi said, patting Christian on the back. "That dress looks good on you, at least."</p><p>"Nnnhhh..." Christian grumbled. "Did you have to take my boxers?" she asked Lia.</p><p>"If I'm going to subject you to the torture of wearing a dress I'm not going to do it by halves." Lia said over her shoulder.</p><p>"It's <i>drafty." </i>Christian said.</p><p>"I wear one to school every day Christian. You can survive wearing one for a couple of hours." Lia said.</p><p>"Why did have to put me in one anyways?" Christian whined.</p><p>"Two reasons." Lia said, holding up her hand. "One, for making that crack about Naota..."</p><p>"And the other?" Christian growled.</p><p>"And the second is Dad said you needed training with your girl side." Lia continued.</p><p>"How is this training?" Christian asked, pointing to the dress.</p><p>"Because you may need to wear one some day." Lia said. "Or you may need to wear gender correct underwear someday."</p><p>"Like that will ever happen." Christian shot back.</p><p>"<i>Wait until puberty hits." </i>Lia thought. Glancing backwards she saw Christian was still sulking along behind them with Mamimi trying to cheer her up. <i>"She's just gonna love the fact she's going to have to wear a bra." </i></p><p>"Don't count on it Christian." Lia said. "You never know what could happen."</p><p>"Hmpf!" Christian answered.</p><p>"We're home." Lia called as she stepped into the house.</p><p>"Dinners about ready." Ranma answered from the living room.</p><p>"Kay." Lia said.</p><p>"Scuse' me." Christian said as she and Mamimi pushed past Lia.</p><p>Heading down the hall Christian and Mamimi went into the main room and sat down at the table. Ranma came in carrying a tray of food and stopped short in surprise.</p><p>"Christian?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Yeah Dad?" Christian asked.</p><p>"Decided to start with your new training early, huh?" Ranma said as he put the tray down.</p><p>"It wasn't my decision." Christian growled.</p><p>"What happened?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"He ribbed me about Naota." Lia said. "That, and you did say he needed training with his girl side."</p><p>"I said girls clothes like you would wear Lia, not put her-"</p><p>"I'm a boy!"</p><p>"-alright, him, in a sun dress!" Ranma said.</p><p>"There!" Christian said as stuck his tongue out.</p><p>"Quiet you." Lia said as she flicked her tail at Christians head.</p><p>Much to Lias surprise Christian snatched her tail in mid air. Christian gave her a classic Saotome grin as she stared at him.</p><p>"Gotcha." Christian said as he gave her tail a little tug.</p><p>"Why you-"Lia said with a scowl. "C'mere!"</p><p>Grabbing her little brother by the arm Lia pulled him into a hug. Once she had a good grip on him Lia raised her hand and grinned.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Mamimi asked.</p><p>"I'm doing a Saotome Secret Sister Technique." Lia said. "The Roasting Chestnut Noogie Fist!"</p><p>"Aaack! Not that!" Christian said as Lia began to give him the noogie.</p><p>Chuckling Ranma turned around to head back in the kitchen. Stepping aside he let Nodoka pass.</p><p>"Oh my!"</p><p>Lia and Christian froze at Nodokas exclamation. Blinking, they looked at Nodoka as she stared at them.</p><p>"That dress is so <i>cute!</i>" she exclaimed.</p><p>"Ack!" Lia and Christian said as they both face -vaulted.</p><p>The next morning dawned hot and muggy, promising to be one of those days where the heat just saps the strength right out of you. Clicking on the fan Ranma blew the bangs out of her face and thanked the kami that her cursed form was smaller and much less sensitive to heat than his regular form.</p><p>Hearing footsteps on the stairs Ranma looked up as Matoko and Lia came down the stairs, Matoko in a pale yellow sun dress with her hair up and Lia in a white shirt and shorts.</p><p>"You two are dressed up." Ranma said.</p><p>"Actually, these are the coolest things we have that we can wear out in public." Lia said.</p><p>"Our swimsuits being somewhat inappropriate for the movies." Matoko added.</p><p>"Tell me about it." Ranma said, pointing to her own attire of a sports bra and shorts.</p><p>All three of them chuckled as the doorbell rang.</p><p>"I got it." Lia said. "It's probably the guys."</p><p>Ranma watched as Lia left the room. Glancing at Matoko she quirked an eyebrow up.</p><p>"The guys?" she asked. "I'd never thought she'd say that about a boy."</p><p>Matoko nodded. "I know. Me either." she said as she headed into the kitchen. "But you have to admit, Naota is a fairly decent person."</p><p>"<i>And slightly dangerous." </i>Ranma added mentally, thinking of the knife Naota carried.</p><p>Hearing footsteps Ranma looked over as Lia came in, followed by Naota and Kenji.</p><p>"Hi Naota." Ranma said. "Hi Kenji."</p><p>"Hi Mr. Saotome." Naota said while Kenji stared. "Tilt your head back Kenji." he added, glancing back at his friend.</p><p>Matoko came back in with a picture of juice and glasses on a tray as they sat down.</p><p>"Anyone care for a glass of juice before we go?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"Me." Lia said, raising her hand.</p><p>"Same here." Naota added.</p><p>"Me too-URK" Kenji added as he got a look at Matokos outfit. "N-nice dress Matoko. I-it looks good on you."</p><p>"Thank you Kenji." Matoko said with a smile as she sat down at the table. "It's my favorite color."</p><p>"Y-you're welcome." Kenji answered as Matoko poured a glass of juice.</p><p>Ranma watched out of the corner of her eye as Matoko handed the first glass to Kenji. Looking away Ranmas mouth quirked into a smile as she tried to keep from laughing. After finishing their juice the four teenagers left for the movies, leaving Ranma at the table.</p><p>"<i>The way to a mans heart is through his stomach." </i>Ranma thought. <i>"Kenji don't stands a chance." </i></p><p>Finishing her juice Ranma poured herself a refill.</p><p>"<i>Though I hope they don't get too serious. They are awfully young." </i>she thought.</p><p>By the time they got out of the movie theater the sun had gone down. Stretching Lia heard what sounded like every vertebrae in her back pop. Twitching her tail Lia glanced at it and frowned.</p><p>"Aw man, my tails gone numb." she said. "It's like it's not there anymore."</p><p>"I know, I can't feel my butt either." Naota said. "I knew we should have stood up during intermission."</p><p>"Whats with Kenji?" Lia asked, pointing to Naotas friend. "He's acting funny."</p><p>Naota looked at his friend. "Huh? Oh, that." he said. "He's just trying to avoid a nosebleed."</p><p>"From what?" Lia asked.</p><p>Naota chuckled. "Offhand, I'd guess that because he's a few centimeters taller than Matoko Kenji is trying to avoid looking at Matokos cleavage." he said.</p><p>"Why doesn't he just look at the ground?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Probably because of those long legs of hers and that skirt of hers." Naota said.</p><p>"Huh?" Lia said. Narrowing her eyes Lia looked over her sisters dress. "Hey, since when did she start wearing them that short?"</p><p>"Since she noticed Kenji, apparently." Naota said.</p><p>"If he's did anything hentai..." Lia growled.</p><p>"Settle down Lia. This is Kenji we're talking about." Naota said. "Mr. I-pass-out-at-the-sight-of-a-girl-in-bloomers?"</p><p>"Oh, yeah, you're right." Lia said. "Still, I can't believe I missed Matokos skirt."</p><p>"You're not the only one Lia." Naota said. "I missed it too."</p><p>"Sure." Lia said, giving Naota a deadpan look.</p><p>"I was distracted" Naota said. "I have been all week!"</p><p>"By what?" Lia asked.</p><p>"By how nice you looked with your hair down." Naota answered in a quiet voice only they could hear. "You look really pretty with it down."</p><p>Lia instinctively grabbed her pigtail. "I do?" she asked.</p><p>Naota nodded. "You do. Even with it up you still look pretty."</p><p>"Thank you." Lia said, suddenly feeling slightly flushed and it having nothing to do with the weather.</p><p>"You're welcome." Naota answered. "Now lets go catch up to Kenji and your sister before something embarrassing happens to them."</p><p>"Lets." Lia answered.</p><p>The following day after school Lia and Matoko stopped by the magazine shop, Lia scoring her Pocky fix and Matoko grabbing her manga anthology. Heading home Matoko sat down in her usual spot while Lia headed to the roof do some serious thinking.</p><p>Sitting down Lia took her box and opened it. Flicking the top off a pack she took out a stick and began to munch on it.</p><p>"<i>Naota said I was pretty." </i>Lia thought.</p><p><i>Well, what do you expect?</i> said the voice. <i>You are very pretty.</i></p><p>"<i>Duh." </i>was Lias response. <i>"It's just the first time a boy has told me that." </i></p><p><i>And how do you feel about that? </i>the voice asked.</p><p>Lia thought for a few moments as she munched on a Pocky stick. Having finished the first pack she took out the second and flicked it open. Taking out a fresh stick she bit down on it.</p><p>"<i>I think I like it." </i>Lia thought.</p><p><i>Good. Then there's no problem.</i> the voice said.</p><p>Sitting back Lia finished the box and watched the world from the roof. As she sat there munching on Pocky Lias thoughts went back to the Matrix trilogy and the fight scenes she had seen.</p><p>They were her favorite movies for the simple reason she had grown up with her parents doing those moves and learning how to do them herself. And as she thought an idea she'd been letting ferment in her brain came to the fore.</p><p>"That might work." Lia said to herself as she crumpled up the pack.</p><p>Standing up Lia walked to the edge of the roof and stepped off the edge. Landing lightly in the yard she walked off to a open area of the yard. Standing with her feet apart and her arms hanging loose at her sides.</p><p>Exhaling slowly Lia closed her eyes and focused her mind to find her mental center. Accessing her chi flows Lia began to apply her mothers chi infusing techniques, not to any one object or place but <i>herself.</i></p><p>Opening her eyes Lia inhaled and looked around at the yard.</p><p>"<i>Do not think, just do." </i>she told her self mentally.</p><p>Leaning forward slightly Lia decided to go forward. There was a rush of wind and her vison blurred around the edges as Lia shot forward, her feet skating over the ground like she was skater on a frozen pond.</p><p>Lia slid to a stop in a cloud of dust, her heart beating a mile a minute. Finally remembering to breathe she turned and looked at the cloud of dust left in her path. Realizing what she had done Lias face split into a huge grin.</p><p>"Cool." she said. Looking down Lia chuckled to herself. "I was right. You can do it."</p><p>Glancing at the koi pond Lia had a lightbulb go off in her head. Tail twitching Lia walked over to it and stood at the edge and looked into it.</p><p>"Why not?" she asked with a shrug. "Can't hurt to try."</p><p>Closing her eyes Lia refocused her mind. Opening her eyes Lia stepped forwards, out over the surface of the pond. Her foot hit the surface of the pond and went in for about a centimeter then stopped.</p><p>With calm deliberation Lia walked to the middle of the pond and stood there. Standing there Lia felt the odd sensation of the water rippling <i>under </i>her feet.</p><p>Ranma mentally reviewed the weeks lesson plans as he walked along the porch, heading to the main room. Turning the corner he walked past Lia, who was standing on the koi pond.</p><p>"Hi Lia." he said as he passed.</p><p>"Hi Dad." Lia answered.</p><p>Turning into the main room Ranma headed to the hall on his way to the furo to clean up after his daily practice.</p><p>"What the-?" Ranma asked as he came to a dead stop. "It couldn't be."</p><p>Turning he went back down the hall to main room and looked, where much to his surprise he discovered he hadn't been seeing things. Mouth agape he stared at Lia as she stood on the koi pond.</p><p>"LIA!" Ranma shouted.</p><p>Lia jumped at her fathers shout and lost her focus.</p><p>"YAAAAH!" she yelled as she fell into the pond.</p><p>Walking to the porch Ranma looked at his now soaked daughter who was sitting in the middle of the pond.</p><p>"Lia, what were you doing?" he asked.</p><p>Lia blinked and looked up at her father. "I was trying out a new technique." she said.</p><p>"How does it work?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"It's based off of Mom's chi infusing technique" Lia said as she stood up. "Except you infuse yourself, instead of an object."</p><p>Stepping out of the pond Lia undid her shirt and began to wring it out.</p><p>"Is there more to it than being able to stand on water?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia answered with a nod. "You can 'skate' across surfaces with it."</p><p>"That could be useful in a fight." Ranma said.</p><p>"Yeah, well it takes a <i>lot </i>of concentration though." Lia said as she finished wringing her shirt. "And you gotta prepare first, so it really wouldn't be useful."</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Neither was the Umi -Sen -Ken when your mother and I started with it." he said. "Keep working on it."</p><p>"Oh, I will." Lia said with a nod. "The potential uses for it are huge."</p><p>"That's my girl." Ranma said with a smile. "Now go get changed. You look like a drowned rat."</p><p>"Yes Dad." Lia said.</p><p>Heading downstairs Lia ran into her mother, who was carrying a basket of wet laundry and muttering about the dubious parentage of the dryer.</p><p>"Hi Mom." Lia said.</p><p>"-bloody piece of junk- oh, hi Lia." Akane said as she looked up. "You mind giving me a hand with the laundry?"</p><p>"Sure." Lia answered.</p><p>Vaulting the hand rail Lia landed on the floor and walked to the laundry room, where there was a second basket of wet laundry. Picking it up she headed back out side to where Akane was. Setting down the basket Lia grabbed a handful of clothe spins and began to hang laundry.</p><p>As she pinned laundry to the line Lias mind went back to the events of the previous day and her own 'conversation' earlier. Deciding she needed a second opinion Lia glanced at her mother.</p><p>"Mom, can I ask you a question?" she asked.</p><p>"Shoot." answered Akane.</p><p>"Yesterday when we were walking home Naota said I looked pretty with my hair down." Lia said.</p><p>"Oh, well you are." Akane said.</p><p>"I know, but that's the first time a boy has said that." Lia said. "Normally they're focused on other parts of me."</p><p>"I know." Akane answered.</p><p>"So why did he say that?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Because he thought you were pretty Lia." Akane said with a chuckle. "That's how boys compliment a girl Lia."</p><p>"Oh." Lia said. "Well that's good to know."</p><p>End.</p><p>Note: For a link to my website where you can see my artwork of my fanfic characters (and some of my own) check my profile under home page.</p>
