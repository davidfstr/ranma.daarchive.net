</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter Ten.</p><p>It was a beautiful day, reflected Kenji as he sipped his mocha latte. The sun was shining, it wasn't too hot-</p><p>"Oh, how cute!" Matoko said as she bent down to look at some toys on display in a shop.</p><p>"<i>And Matokos wearing a </i>thong<i>" </i>Kenji thought as he quickly shifted his gaze upwards.</p><p>He also stepped up behind Matoko and leaned over her shoulder to take a look, unconsciously shielding her rear end from public view.</p><p>"What do you think Kenji?" Matoko asked, straightening up and showing Kenji what she had found.</p><p>What she had found were what looked like chibi catgirls, covered in orange fur with black tiger stripes and dressed in overalls and a t- shirt with red tennis shoes.</p><p>"They are cute." Kenji said with a nod. "What are they?"</p><p>Matoko looked at the tag with a puzzled look. "They're called... Timbas." she said as she read the tag. "And theres a warning that says do not feed brownies. Ever."</p><p>"Odd."</p><p>Matoko nodded as she put the doll back and stood up, hitching up her pants as she did so. "I agree. Why you put a warning on a toy telling you not to feed it brownies?" she asked, to which Kenji shrugged.</p><p>"I don't know." Kenji answered. "I'm not an ad exec like my brother, so I wouldn't know."</p><p></p><p>"Ah -choo!"</p><p>"Bless you Mashida -san."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Matoko nodded as they started wandering along again.</p><p>"So, what so you think should happen with Atsumori and Tomomi?" Matoko asked out of the blue.</p><p>Kenji thought for a second as he considered his answer. Such questions were the norm in their relationship; one of them would ask the other a question out of the blue on a topic completely unrelated to the one they were on and file the answer away for later.</p><p>"Well... how about something very mundane?" Kenji asked. "Economic trips, and Atsumori helps her up?"</p><p>Economic and Atsumori were the main characters in the manga they were producing, which was the story about two best friends who were perfect for each other and didn't know it. The fact it was set in the 32nd century and they were a mech pilot and a mechanic were secondary.</p><p>Not to mention the setting allowed for some different plot settings than were the norm- such as when Atsumori saw Economic naked in the bath because her bathroom was at eye level with his mech.</p><p>"Different... I think I can work with that." Matoko said with a nod, her eyes unfocused as the wheels began turning in her mind.</p><p>Kenji on the other hand, for once <i>wasn't </i> lost in his own little world. His attention was solely focused on Matoko as she walked. The low rise flares jeans and midriff tank top was a new look for her, and it opened his mind to all sorts of things.</p><p>Her figure for example.</p><p>In the two years that he had known Matoko Kenji had always thought of her as a friend first, girl second. But somehow it had clicked in the back of his brain that his friend <i>was </i>a <i>girl</i>, and he was a <i>boy, </i>and they liked each other.</p><p>Thus, that's why he was admiring her form, and the way her clothes accented her form. For example, her tank top.</p><p>It was a white tank top that ended a couple of inches below her belly button, and hugged her form perfectly. from there it was several centimeters of bare flesh and taunt tummy to where her jeans began.</p><p>Her jeans, her jeans were a masterpiece in denim. They rode low on her hips, flaunting her half -Caucasian heritage and fitting her every curve all the way down to her knees, where they flared out.</p><p>"We're here."</p><p>Kenji was knocked back to reality by Matoko's gentle tap on his shoulder. Blinking, he saw that they were at the door to the apartment.</p><p>"Sorry." he said sheepishly as he took his keys out. "Got distracted."</p><p>Matoko smiled and gave him a little nod, that was something they both were guilty of. Stepping inside they found the apartment to be spotless with exception of his desk and work area, which was a certified disaster area.</p><p>Pocketing his keys Kenji headed to his desk while Matoko opened some windows.</p><p>"Are you hungry?" Matoko asked, which got an answering growl from Kenji's stomach. "I'll take that as a yes." she said as Kenji gave his gut a look.</p><p>Grabbing a sketch pad and pencil Kenji decided to give his imagination free reign to kill time while Matoko made lunch. He was only halfway through his first sketch of a typical scantily clad anime fighter chick when he realized it bore a striking resemblance to Matoko.</p><p>"<i>Better not finish that one..." </i>he thought as he flipped the page over to a fresh sheet.</p><p>Looking at the blank page Kenji suddenly found himself with a complete blank as to what to draw. Tapping the end of his pencil on the table Kenji thought for a few moments before he decided to just work on the main characters of the manga.</p><p>He started off by drawing a circle where he wanted Economic to be, with a second circle where he wanted Atsumori to be. Those circles represented their heads.</p><p>He then put a vertical line through Tonomi's circle, with another through Atsumori's. These lines indicated where the centerline of the face was, and also showed which way they were facing. Then eyeballing the circles, he added in horizontal lines bisecting horizontal ones, these lines representing the eye lines.</p><p>From there it was relativity simple to finish roughing out the curve of the face and the jaw lines for each character. After he was done with that Kenji then drew a curving horizontal line from the roughed out heads to show the basic flow of the body.</p><p>With that done Kenji then marked off each character's height in heads(1) using his thumb and forefinger. Once he had that yardstick in place he drew in their frames using stick figures, then began to rough in their bodies using cylinders, spheres, ovals, and other shapes to get the mass in place.</p><p>Kenji was beginning to do the clean up work when Matoko tapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>"Kenji." she said "Lunch is ready."</p><p>Kenji blinked at her a couple of times then shook his head. "Okay." he said as he shut the sketchpad closed.</p><p>Moving the sketchpad to one side he was not surprised at all to see that Matoko had already set the table and had the food out -he was notorious for zoning out and losing track of time while he was drawing.</p><p>"Oh dear, I forgot the chopsticks." Matoko said as she surveyed the table. "Eee! And I left the stove on!" she added as she spotted the ring of blue flames around the burner.</p><p>Hurrying over Matoko turned the stove off and dug some chopsticks out of the drawer. "I'm so drifty today..." she said with a shake of her head. "I'm lucky I my heads still attached."</p><p>Chopsticks in hand, Matoko turned around and started to walk towards Kenji, who had gotten up to put his sketchpad away.</p><p>"Kenji -kun, your chopsticks." Matoko said as she held out her hand to him.</p><p>And then tripped over the cuffs of her own jeans.</p><p>Or to be more accurate, Matoko tripped when the cuff of her left pant leg caught on a loose section tatami and sent her flying into Kenji.</p><p>Matoko let out a startled squeal of surprise as she crashed into him and they toppled backwards, Kenji's head hitting the floor with a loud <i>thump</i>.</p><p>"Kenji, are you all right?" Matokos voice asked as Kenji shook his head to clear it, then opened his eyes to something he had never really noticed before.</p><p>"<i>wow, I never noticed that before..." </i>he thought as he looked up at Matoko.</p><p>"Kenji?" she asked, a bit of worry in her voice.</p><p>"I- I'm fine." he answered. "B- but- I noticed you have the most beautiful eyes..."</p><p>At the point Matokos brain just shut down.</p><p>"<i>He- he- did he just say what I think he said?" </i>she thought as Kenji brushed some the hair away from her face.</p><p>"I can't believe I didn't notice them until now..." he added. "They're so ... <i>alive.</i>"</p><p>"Y-You think so?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"Yeah, I do." Kenji answered. "In fact, theres a lot of things I've noticed about you." Kenji said. "I want to tell you about them."</p><p>"What about lunch?"</p><p>"It can wait."</p><p></p><p>Masami Sano paced on the platform as she waited for the 12:35 from Tokyo to come in. Leaning up against a post her sister Ikuko looked up from her manga and sighed.</p><p>"'Sami, you're going to wear a hole in the platform if you don't stop pacing." she said. "Our nephew will get here when he gets here."</p><p>Masami gave an exasperated sigh as she turned to face her sister. "Ikuko, the last time I saw Naota her was this high." Masami held her hand at about chin level.</p><p>"I know." Ikuko said with a nod. "<i>I </i>was there too, you know."she added as Masumi opened her mouth to say something. "And before you say it, I'd like to meet his new wife too."</p><p>Masumi sighed and began pacing again as Ikuko shook her head before going back to her manga.</p><p>This continued on for the next ten minutes until the sound of a train horn could be heard in the distance. Masumi stopped her pacing and Ikuko put away her manga as a set of lights winked on in the distance.</p><p>The lights grew and grew, eventually resolving into a bullet train as it pulled into the station. Masumi and Ikuko watched as car after car went by until it stopped.</p><p>Then the doors opened and only a few people got, mainly businessmen and what looked like a couple of travelers.</p><p>"Did Dokuhotei tell you what they looked like?" Masumi asked as the scanned the people as they came out.</p><p>Ikuko shook her head in the negative. "No. Just that we'd know when we saw them." she said as a flash of red in the corner of her eye caught her attention. "Typical of him really. Telling us just enough of what he thinks we need to know..." she trailed off as she looked at the girl. "Wow, look at that dye job."</p><p>"Huh?" Masumi said as she turned her head to see what her sister was talking about. "Oh, wow. You're right." she said as the girl turned around and looked back in the train, tapping her foot impatiently. "I wonder how much it cost to dye that much hair?"</p><p>"Probably a lot." Ikuko said as a boy stepped off the train, obviously the redheads companion. He was an attention getter as well, wearing a baseball cap along with an a -line t shirt that showed off his sculpted physique and gold tattoos. "Take a look at her friend." she added as the boy looked around the platform and focused on them.</p><p>"Aunt Ko! Aunt Sumi!" he said, waving his arm as he started towards them.</p><p>"Naota!" the two women exclaimed is shock and surprise as he got closer to them.</p><p>This older version of Naota was... <i>different </i>from what they had remembered about him. This Naota showed confidence in his stride for one thing. The tattoos were different as well, going up onto his face.</p><p>"You- You've grown." Ikuko said in a lame attempt to start a conversation.</p><p>Rolling her eyes Masumi stepped forwards and leaned in to look her nephew in the eye -or would have anyways, if Naota hadn't been wearing a pair of sunglasses.</p><p>"Okay, Nao, spill it." Masumi said as she pinched one of the stripes on his cheek "Whats with the tattoos."</p><p>"Nao?" the redhead asked coyly as she looked at Naota.</p><p>"Masumi!" Ikuko hissed.</p><p>"Owww!" said Naota as he grabbed his aunts arm. "I can explain..."</p><p>"Then start talking." Masumi said. "I'd like to know why my nephew is all tattooed up like he's some sort of Yakuza or something."</p><p>"It's a long story-ow!" Naota said as he tried to dislodge his aunt's fingers from his cheek. "And I don't want to-ow! - go into it here at the train -ow!- station." he added.</p><p>That mollified Masumi for the meanwhile and she relinquished her grip on his cheek. "But you had better tell me..." she warned before turning to face the redhead. "And where are your manners? You haven't introduced your friend here."</p><p>rubbing his cheek Naota shot a look at Masumi. "<i>She </i>is my wife." he said, trying not to laugh at the looks of complete surprise on the two womens faces. "Aunt Masumi, Aunt Ikuko, this is my wife Lia Saotom-I mean Sano." he said. "Lia, meet my aunts Masumi and Ikuko." he added, pointing to each one in turn.</p><p>"Pleased to meet you." Lia said as she bowed to each of them in turn. "Naota told me a lot about you on the train."</p><p>"He did, did he?" Masumi said as she shot her nephew a look. "What did he say about us?"</p><p>Lia smiled and shrugged. "Just that you two were his favorite aunts." she said.</p><p>"That's a nice thing to say." Masami said as she looked at Naota. "A pity he didn't tell us about you though..." she added as Naota sweat dropped.</p><p>"Well, we have plenty of time to get acquainted on the drive back to town." Ikuko said, interjecting herself into the conversation and sparing Naota a guilt trip. "And it's a long drive back there, so we should get going if we want to make it by dinner."</p><p>"Good idea." Masumi said with a nod. "Lets go. This way..." she said as she turned and walked off.</p><p>Ikuko, Lia, and Naota looked at each other for a moment, shrugged, and started off after Masumi.</p><p></p><p>Bre hummed to herself as she walked down the street to the bachelor pad that her brother and Kenji were sharing. She had been planning doing a special dinner for Evans that evening and had needed to pick up a few odds and ends relating to that.</p><p>And since she had been in the neighborhood, so to speak, Bre thought she'd swing by and check in on the tall twins and see how they were doing.</p><p>"<i>I wonder what it will take to get Matoko and Kenji to put on some weight?" </i>she thought as she turned the corner and the print shop sign came into view. <i>"I mean, honestly, they are waaay too skinny for my taste."</i></p><p>Still humming, she walked down the street and turned into the alley that ran alongside it. Stepping around the various craters and the stacks of bottles that were waiting to be recycled Bre made her way down the alley to the stairs that ran up to the apartment.</p><p>Padding up the stairs Bre decided that she'd try and surprise them. Reaching the top of the stairs Bre peeked into the window to see if the coast was clear. Not immediately seeing Kenji or Matoko Bre was about to go in when a flicker of movement caught her eye. Craning her neck around Bre tried to get a better view and got a shock instead: she saw Matoko sitting in Kenjis lap, engaged in some <i>seriously </i>heavy making out.</p><p>Pulling away from the window Bre leaned against the balcony and thought.</p><p>"<i>Okay Bre, stay calm.</i>" she told herself. <i>"This is a good thing. It means they have finally opened up to each other. So you can't interrupt them." </i></p><p>Taking a deep breath Bre started back down the stairs to the alley. <i>"But, what about Ranma?" </i>she thought to herself as she reached bottom. <i>"Eh, what he doesn't know won't hurt Kenji." </i>she thought.</p><p>She waited until she had gone a couple of blocks before she called Ranma though.</p><p></p><p>Ikuko was right, Naota mused as the van pulled into town, it <i>had </i>been a long drive. The sun was setting behind the mountains as the street lights flickered on all over town while Lia dozed in the seat beside him.</p><p>"It hasn't changed much, has it Aunt Ikuko?" he asked.</p><p>"No, it hasn't." Ikuko answered from the drivers seat. "Not much anyways." she said as they passed by a diner. "There are a couple of new faces here and there. Mostly at the elementary school."</p><p>Naota chuckled as Ikuko turned the van onto a side street and began to negotiate the narrow turns to the Sano family's ancestral home.</p><p>"We're almost there." Ikuko said as she paused for a gaggle of children to get out of the way of the van. "Better wake up Sleepyhead back there."</p><p>Naota chuckled as he reached over and scratched Lia behind the ear.</p><p>"Wake up Neko." he said as Lia came to and nyaowed sleepily, which caused Masumi to turn around in her seat.</p><p>"Did she just <i>'nyaow'</i>?" she asked.</p><p>Naota nodded as Lia sat up in her seat ans looked around. "Yeah, it's one of those effects of the Neko -ken." he said.</p><p>"Ah." Masumi nodded and sat back in her seat.</p><p>"Where are we?" Lia asked as she looked out the window.</p><p>"Mabase." Naota answered.</p><p>"Oh." Lia said as she turned around to look out the back window. "You weren't kidding. It is a small town."</p><p>"Yep." Naota said as the van turned into a yard. "And here we are. The Sano family's spiritual home."</p><p>"Wow." Lia said as she got a look at the house. "It's gotta be at least as big as ours back in Nerima."</p><p>"Probably is." Naota said as they parked in front of the front door.</p><p>"You two can go inside." Ikuko said as she opened her door. "We'll have someone put your bags in the guest room."</p><p>Opening her door Masumi sniffed the air. "You'd better hurry though. It smells like dinner's on." she said as she turned around, only to find she was addressing empty seats. "Wow, they're fast." she said as Ikuko nodded in agreement.</p><p>Stepping inside the house they found the living room empty, with the table halfway set. Looking around Lia scowled and scratched her head.</p><p>"Hey, I thought she said that dinner was about ready." she said, sniffing the air. "Why would they leave the table half-set?" she asked.</p><p>Naota shrugged. "I don't know." he said before he drew his SOCOM and jabbed the muzzle into the face of the teenager sneaking up behind him. "Why don't we ask them?"</p><p>"Good idea." Lia said as she looked up at the ceiling. "I was wondering what she was doing up there." she added as the girl on the ceiling sweatdropped.</p><p>"Well?" Naota asked. "We're waiting." he said as the boy began to sweat bullets.</p><p>"Ah... you see..." began the boy as Ikuko and Masumi walked into the room.</p><p>"Naota! Put that away! You can play with your cousins later!" Ikuko said when she saw Naota's pistol.</p><p>Seeing Lia looking up at the ceiling Masumi followed her gaze up and saw what she was looking at. "Tomoe, were you and Ryusake trying to sneak up on your cousin and his wife?" she asked.</p><p>The girl called Tomoe chuckled nervously as Lia got a puzzled expression on her face. "These two are your cousins?" she asked as she looked at Naota.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said with a nod as he lowered his SOCOM. "These two are trying to earn their genin(2) rank, and so keep an eye out to test their skills." he added as both of his cousins laughed nervously.</p><p>Ikuko chuckled as Masumi went into the kitchen. "Well, they have gotten better." she said in their defense. "But I think I remember telling them under no circumstances were they to try anything with you?" she asked, looking at Ryusake pointedly.</p><p>Ryusake chuckled nervously as Ikuko gave him a 'I told you so' look. "Well, we thought it was gonna be you and Masumi coming in first..." he said as Naota tsked . "What?" he asked his cousin.</p><p>"Always confirm your target." explained Naota. "Thats one of the first things you learn."</p><p>"Not to mention following orders." Ikuko chimed in. "So, I think we need to review your lessons." she added, pointing at the table. "So, Tomoe, you can finish setting the table while you, Ryusake, can get Naota and Lia some tea. Understand?"</p><p>"Yes, Aunt Ikuko!" Tomoe and Ryusake chorused.</p><p>"Now get to work." Ikuko ordered.</p><p>Tomoe dropped down to the floor with a light 'thump' as Ryusake scurried into the kitchen to fetch Naota and Lia their tea.</p><p>"So, tell me, whats new with you?" Ikuko asked as they all sat down at the table. "You did promise to tell us, remember?" she asked as Masumi came back in from the kitchen.</p><p>"Thats right, I did, didn't I?" asked Naota rhetorically as he sat down with Lia. "Well, for starters, its more than tattoos." he said, running his hands along his forearms.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Masumi asked as she waited for Tomoe to finish setting her place.</p><p>"Well, for starters, " Naota said as he removed his cap "I'm not what you could call 'human' any more." he said as his ears came free.</p><p>"What...?" Ikuko asked as Masumi whistled. "what the hell?</p><p>Removing his sunglasses Naota looked his aunt in the eye. "I'm a Neko -yokai." he explained.</p><p>"How?" Masumi asked. "Because if memory serves me, you didn't have those ears the last time you were here." she pointed out. "But they <i>are </i>cute though." she added, giving Lia a sly look.</p><p>"They are, aren't they?" Lia asked, reaching over to give one a tweak.</p><p>"I didn't have this either." Naota added as he shifted position and his tail slid free. "But, to answer your question, I pissed off a kami, so he turned me into a yokai." he explained.</p><p>"Okay." Masumi said with a nod. "So we weren't told this why?" she asked.</p><p>Naota simply shrugged. "I don't know." he said. "You'll have to ask my idiot father and grandfather."</p><p>Masumi nodded as Ikuko sized him up. "So, you're now a yokai?" she asked, getting a confirming nod from Naota. "So, how did it change you?" she asked.</p><p>"Hmmm... how can I put this?" Naota said to himself as he pondered his aunts question. "How about this: Take your pulse and tell me if I'm right." he suggested.</p><p>"Okay..." Ikuko said as she held he fingers to her wrist and started to take her pulse.</p><p>"You have it?" he asked after a minute. Getting a nod from Ikuko he continued. "Alright, your pulse is ninety -eight point seven beats per minute." he said as Ikuko gasped in surprise.</p><p>"He's right!" she said, her voice registering her shock.</p><p>"I can hear your heartbeat at eight meters." Naota said as he stretched. "Thats how I heard Ryusake coming up behind me. His heart sounded like a bloody jackhammer."</p><p>"So how did she" Masumi nodded at Lia "know Tomoe was hiding on the ceiling?" she asked.</p><p>Lia smiled and shrugged. "Thats easy. I sensed their chi." she answered.</p><p>"Figures." Masumi sighed as she looked at Tomoe, who was frozen in shock as she gaped at her cousin. "He would marry a chi master." she added as she snapped her fingers in front of Tomoes face. "Hey, what did Ikuko tell you? Get to work!"</p><p>Snapping out of her daze Tomoe immediately went back to setting the table. Turning back to Lia Masumi shot her a thoughtful look.</p><p>"So, what are you two's plans?" she asked as Naota and Lia blinked in unison. "What?" she asked, not expecting their reaction.</p><p>Naota shrugged. "It's nothing." he said. "It's just the first time anyones asked us that."</p><p>Masumi blanched at that. "You're kidding me." she said, which got a shake of their heads from Naota and Lia. "What kind of parents don't ask- oh, wait a minute, you have Dokuhotei and Kamone running around." she said. "Its something I'd expect from those idiots."</p><p>Naota laughed at his aunts assessment of his father and grandfather. "Thats about right for those two." he said.</p><p>"And my parents already know that I have my mind made up on what I'm gonna do." chimed in Lia.</p><p>"And what are you going to do?" asked Ikuko.</p><p>"I'm gonna go to school and get my teaching certificate." answered Lia. "I'm gonna teach English."</p><p>Now it was Ikukos turn to blink in surprise. "English? Thats a hard subject to learn." she said. "At least, it was for me." she added with a laugh.</p><p>Lia laughed as well. "It's not a hard subject for me." she said. <b>"It's my native language after all." </b>she added in English.</p><p>Ikuko and Masumi gaped at Lia as Naota rolled his eyes. "Lia, do you have to do that?" he asked as Lia gave him a grin.</p><p>"What do you think?" she asked.</p><p>"Sorry I asked." Naota groaned.</p><p>Turning back to Ikuko and Masumi Lia continued. "As I was saying, English is my native language." she said. "Being born in America and all."</p><p>The two women nodded as Ryusake came in with a tray with several cups of tea on it.</p><p>"Teas ready." he said as he set the tray on the table.</p><p>"Thank you." Masumi said as she took her tea. "So, your father's American?" she asked. "Or is it your mother?"</p><p>"Neither." Lia answered. "They're both Japanese. They were living there when I was born." she explained. "We lived there till I was seven."</p><p>"What do they do for a living?" asked Ikuko.</p><p>"They're martial arts teachers." Lia answered. "They teach their own style. Anything Goes Martial Arts."</p><p>Ikuko and Masumi both perked up at the mention on her parents school. "Anything Goes?" Ikuko asked. "Is your father Ranma Saotome?"</p><p>Lia beamed at the mention of her father. "The one and only." she said. "You've heard of him?" she asked.</p><p>Ikuko and Masumi nodded. "Considering three of his students have been placing in the top twenty five in martial arts tourneys?" Masumi said. "How could we not?"</p><p>"So I can assume you are one of his students?" Ikuko asked, getting a nod from Lia. "You want to come to the dojo and spar with our students?" she asked as Naota rolled his eyes.</p><p>"I'd love to." Lia said. "And Naota will be with me, wont you dear?" she asked, giving her mate a nudge.</p><p>"Of course I will." Naota said as he eyed Ryusake and Tomoe. "I gotta put these two through their paces or they wont make genin before they twenty -five." he added as the two sweatdropped.</p><p>"Good." Ikuko said with a nod. "I'll see you two there." she said. "And Naota, no using that of yours." she added. "You have plenty of other ways to terrorize them."</p><p>"I know." said Naota as he gave them a grin. "I'm looking forward to it." he added.</p><p></p><p>Sliding the door shut to Christians room Ranma shook her head. She strongly suspected that if it wasn't for Mamimis influence the boys room would be a complete and total pig stye. Shifting the laundry basket in her hands Ranma headed to Matokos room as she made the rounds with the fresh laundry.</p><p>As she reached the door Ranma balanced the basket on her hip as she slid open the door to her daughters room she noticed the basket felt lighter than it usually did, and had to remind herself when she looked down that it <i>was </i>lighter because Lia's laundry wasn't in it. Her laundry was over at Naota- no, make that <i>Lia </i>and Naotas apartment.</p><p>"<i>I wonder if other parents do this..." </i>thought Ranma as she stepped into Matokos room. <i>"And I wonder when I'll be going through the same thing with her?" </i></p><p>Not getting an answer from her second daughters room Ranma shrugged and wandered over to the dresser. Putting the basket on the floor Ranma slid the top drawer open and began to put Matokos laundry in.</p><p>First drawer, blouses on the left, followed by shirts placed dark to light in ascending order. Second drawer, Skirts and slacks, placed in the same way- wait.</p><p>Ranma blinked as she looked at the newest articles of clothing in his daughters second drawer.</p><p>"<i>Jeans?" </i>she thought as she fingered the denim fabric thoughtfully. <i>"Must've decided to branch out a bit." </i></p><p>With another shrug Ranma put Matokos skirts and slacks next to the jeans and slid the drawer shut.</p><p>Third drawer, underwear. Panties on the left, bras on the right- Ranma paused again as she noticed another new addition to Matokos wardrobe. Reaching in Ranma withdrew something that looked like a patch of fabric held together with shoestrings-</p><p>"AKANE!"</p><p></p><p>Pouring a cup of tea Akane looked across the table at a slightly annoyed redhead.</p><p>"Honestly Ranma, you know this was going happen." Akane said as she slid the cup over to her. "She's a big girl now."</p><p>Ranma merely grunted as she took the tea and sipped it. Sighing Akane poured herself a cup.</p><p>"I'm okay with the jeans, and the new tops."</p><p>Akanes teacup paused halfway to her lips. "Oh?" she asked. "So why is what she wears under them such a problem?"</p><p>Setting her jaw Ranma looked up from her tea at Akane. "Why do you think?" she asked.</p><p>Akane gave Ranma an amused smile over her tea. "Because what she's wearing is 'sexy' and that's something you as a father have trouble accepting? Is that it?" she asked as Ranma growled and looked away.</p><p>Taking a sip of her tea Akane set it down on the table. "You know Ranma, us women do usually wear those because we want to avoid panty lines, not because we want to be sexy." she pointed out.</p><p>"Then why can't what she already has be used?" growled Ranma.</p><p>Shaking her head at her husbands stubbornness Akane continued with her explanations. "Because, Ranma dear, Matoko generally wore loose slacks and skirts, not jeans." she said. "The two are very different, you know that."</p><p>Ranma made a sound somewhere between a snort and a growl as she glowered at her tea. "I still don't have to like it." she muttered, glancing at the clock. "And I gotta get the dojo ready for class." she added before tossing back her tea.</p><p>Still grumbling, Ranma stalked off to the dojo as Akane swirled the dregs of her tea around in her cup.</p><p>"I wonder..." she mused "What Ranma's going to do when Christian and Mamimi discover the opposite sex?"</p><p>Putting the teacup down Akane shook her head. "What am I saying? What are <i>any </i>of going to do? He's a handful now. As a teenager doesn't bear imagining."</p><p></p><p>Flopping back onto the tatmai Lia sighed and looked up at the ceiling. "Well that went well." she said. "Though I  was wondering how long it was going to be before the curse asserted itself."</p><p>In the bathroom Naota snorted in amusement. "I've noticed it generally takes effect right when theres the most amount of people to see it and ask all sorts of questions." he said. "Inn this case, right after dinner when the table was being cleared."</p><p>Rolling over Lia flipped her tail out of the way and got into a more comfortable position. "Naturally." she said as she pulled her pigtal free from under herself. "I thought you had told them about my curse."</p><p>Naota shrugged as he came out of the bathroom. "I figured that it would be easier if they found out for themselves." he said as Lia nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Probably a good idea." Lia said as she began to unravel her pigtail. "Hey could you get me my hairbrush please? It's in my suitcase."</p><p>"Sure." said Naota as he stepped towards their bag, which were lying by the dresser. "Which compartment is it in?"</p><p>"the main one." Lia answered as she sat up and continued to unravel her braid. "It's on top, along with my sleep shirt."</p><p>"Thanks." Naota said as he moved his bag out of the way so he could get to Lias. Unzipping the bag he tugged the flap open, feeling a slight bit of resistance as he did so. "Lia! Get dow-" was all he was able to say before the device concealed in Lia baggage went off with a <i>pop. </i></p><p>Confused, Lia watched as Naota scrambled back from her bag, coughing as a cloud of green powder rose up. "Naota, whats wrong- whoa." she began before a familiar scent tickled her nostrils. "Oooh baby." she said as the catnip took effect. "Thats good stuff." she purred.</p><p>Wiping the tears from his eyes Naota looked up at Lia. "What the <i>-cough-</i> hell are you- <i>hack- </i>talking about Lia?" he asked as Lia began to stalk forwards towards him.</p><p>"Nyaow!" was Lias response before she pounced on Naota, knocking him flat.</p><p><i>Thats </i>when Naotas senses caught up with his brain and told him just what it was exactly he was smelling. "catnip." he said as he looked up into the happily grinning face of Lia. "Someone rigged your bag with catnip." Naota continued as he tried to mentally fight his way through the fuzz that was building up in his brain. "Who... would... " he said as he lost the battle.</p><p>Lia giggled as the expression on his face changed. "Nao- kun look funny." she said as she snuggled up next to him. "Brush Lia's hair?" she asked hopefully.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota answered absently. Boy, did he feel good. He couldn't understand why he was so worked up about the stuff before... it certainly relaxed a guy...</p><p>"Where's Lia's brush?" Lia asked as she picked up Naotas right hand and bringing him back to the subject at hand.</p><p>"oh." Naota said with a blink. "It's... it's still in your bag." he said. Yeah, that's right. He was going to brush her hair. "I'll get it." he said as he got to his knees. Crawling over to Lias bag Naota retrieved her hairbrush and crawled back to her.</p><p>Fascinated Lia watched as Naota retrieved her hairbrush. "Brush Lias hair now?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota answered as he got behind her. "Brush Lias hair now."</p><p>Taking her brush Naota began to brush Lia's hair, starting at the top and began to gently work his way down. Closing her eyes Lia murred and leaned back into the brush.</p><p>"Feel good?" Naota asked a purring Lia.</p><p>"Uh -huh..." Lia purred. "Could you get mmmy earrrsss?" she rumbled.</p><p>Naota nodded and began to brush behind Lias ears, who's purring immediately increased in volume. "How's that?" he asked.</p><p>"Gooood."was Lia response. "Rrrreaaal goood."</p><p>As Naota brushed her hair Lia got to her knees and began to undo her shirt. Naota watched as she got up. "What are you doing?" he asked.</p><p>"Getting comfy." was Lias response.</p><p>"Okay." Naota said as she shrugged her shirt off, then began to undo her jeans. "I hope no one comes by." he added.</p><p>Lia giggled as she kicked her jeans off. "We'rrre marrried, ssssilly Naota." she said as she undid her bra. "It'sss okay."</p><p>The rest of her underwear followed- not that Naota minded. Far from it. He also enjoyed the feel of her hair, and the running of the brush through it, and the sound of her purring. So he was taken by surprise when Lia got up and walked around so she was standing behind him.</p><p>"Lia, you're hair..." he began as Lia reached down and started to massage his shoulders.</p><p>"Sssshh." she soothed as she massaged. "Nao -kun need to be comfy too."</p><p>Naotas response was a deep, rumbling purr as Lia massaged away the tension in his shoulders, tapping a few pressure points to help relieve the tension. Happily insensate from both the massage and the catnip, Naota never felt it when Lia ran her fingers over his torso and his shirt fell away. One moment it was there, the next moment it was gone, and he couldn't care less.</p><p>When he flopped over onto the floor Naotas jeans and boxers followed Lias clothes as she continued to give Naota a full body massage, his purring gradually getting deeper and louder as he relaxed.</p><p></p><p>In the main house muffled thumps and screams could be heard as Ikuko sat at the dining room table reading a manga.</p><p>"Masami, put a cork in it! Dokuhotei said leave the newlyweds alone and we are going to!" she yelled at the closet where her sister currently lay bound and gagged. "And before you try to escape, think about this: Naota's a member of the School. You think you can dodge bullets?" she asked as Masami fell silent. "I didn't think so. Now behave and I'll let you out when its bedtime."</p><p>"Mmmmmmmm!"</p><p></p><p>Changed into her nightgown Akane padded down the hall to the master bedroom, stopping by Christians room to check on him and Mamimi. Sliding the door open a crack, Akane peeked in and saw the pair of them sound asleep.</p><p>Reassured that two of the houses children were safe and accounted for, and having just gotten off the phone with Matoko, Akane headed to bed.</p><p>"Hey Ranma," Akane asked as she slid the door shut behind her. "Did you know that Christian and Mamimi make a cute couple?"</p><p>Putting his magazine down Ranma looked up at his wife. "For a couple of nine year olds, yes." he said. "But lets not get ahead of ourselves." he cautioned as Akane stepped over to the futon. "We still have Matoko and Kenji, remember. Of course, by the time those two get serious Christian and Mamimi will probably have married and have three kids."</p><p>Akane laughed as she climbed into the futon. "true." she said with a nod. " And don't forget her parents."</p><p>Ranma groaned and rolled his eyes. "Don't remind me." he said. "The last thing I want for Christian to get from me is a Hibiki out for his blood."</p><p>"Likewise." Akane agreed. "Thats something I'd rather not have as a family tradition." she said as she picked up the novel she had been reading. "I don't think the neighborhood association would tolerate the massive property damage this time around."</p><p>Ranma chuckled as he flipped a page. "I'm surprised they tolerated it the first time around." he said, glancing at Akane out of the corner of his eye. "Or did Nabiki have something to do with that?"</p><p>Now it was Akanes turn to chuckle as she flipped to where she had marked her place. "I thought that too, but when I asked Nabiki said that the reason why were never sued was because the insurance companies didn't believe them when they filed a claim."</p><p>Ranma blinked and looked up at Akane. "You know,..." he said "That actually makes the most sense."</p><p>"Scary, isn't it?" asked Akane.</p><p>"Just slightly." answered Ranma before returning to his magazine.</p><p></p><p>One of the stereotypes of the Japanese salary man was that he put in long hours at the office, putting in easily eighty to a hundred hour work weeks, putting the company ahead of all else. This stereotype was one of the holdovers from Japan's 'bubble economy' from the late nineteen eighties along with cradle to the grave benefits and job security.</p><p>Takata Mashida was living that stereotype, being an ad executive for a multi -billion keritsu. And he was also living the second stereotype as well, being guaranteed his job by being married to one of the majority stockholders daughter.</p><p>Takata on the other hand, would have much rather been sleeping. Currently it was eleven in the evening and a whole <i> mountain </i>of paperwork in front of him. His coworkers were off wining and dining the clients, and he got the fun job of crossing all the tees and dotting all the i's.</p><p>Flipping a folder closed he put it on the 'done' stack and leaned back in his chair as he rubbed his eyes. Flopping his hands down Takata looked at the pile of papers on his desk.</p><p>"One down, too freaking many to go." he sighed, reaching for another folder.</p><p>Flipping it open he began to read the file when there was a knock on his office door. Blinking in surprise he looked up. "Yes?" he asked.</p><p>"Tea service!" came the reply.</p><p>Takata scowled slightly as he pushed his chair back. "Tea service? What are you talking about?" he asked as he stood up.</p><p>"Asako's Tea Service." came the reply as the door opened and a grinning Asako poked her head in. "It's a service that provides tea, refreshments, and companionship to salary men named Takata Mashida."</p><p>Flopping back down into his chair Takata smiled and shook his head. "Come on in." he said.</p><p>Pushing the door open Asako came in carrying a tray loaded with a thermos -full of tea, Takata surmised- , two cups, and what looked like a box lunch. As she came into the light of his desk lamp Takata noted that Asako did not have her disguise up, as evidenced by her decidedly pointed ears, whisker marks on her cheeks, and the six bushy fox tails swishing as she walked.</p><p>"You don't have your disguise up." he said as Asako put the tray on a clear spot on his desk. "Isn't that dangerous?"</p><p>Asako chuckled as she unscrewed the lid to the thermos. "Not really. The Tokyo PD's Cataclysm Division knows better than to tangle with a kistune over three tails." she said as she began to pour tea. "And Sesshy -poo knows that he cant touch me without the kitsune population getting into an uproar- and a population of upset kitsunes is something he dosen't want."</p><p>"Really." Takata said as he accepted a cup of tea from Asako.</p><p>"Really." Asako said, giving him a wide grin. "Besides, he's too busy trying to get info on the tai -youkai thats wandering around to worry about little old me." she added.</p><p>"Good luck with that." Takata said. "Naota's a Hagakure. He ain't gonna find squat."</p><p>"I know." Asako said with a nod. "But it's gonna be fun to watch."</p><p>"if you say so Asako." Takata said before taking a sip of his tea. "Hey, this is good tea." he said, surprised. "Where did you get it?"</p><p>Asako merely smiled as she took a sip of her own tea. "I have my sources." she answered. "Plus about six hundred years of experience making tea."</p><p>"Okay, so the reason why you own a shop specializing in womens intiment apparel is...?" Takata asked, looking at Asako over the top of his tea.</p><p>Asako laughed as she set her teacup on the desk. "Because it's interesting." she answered. "You see all sorts of interesting things."</p><p>"Like what, dare I ask?"</p><p>"Well..." Asako said as she recrossed her legs and leaned forwards towards Takata. "The other day your little brother's girlfriend came in and bought some stuff for him."</p><p>Takata chuckled and took a sip from his tea. "Poor Stringbean." he said as Asako nodded. "He doesn't stand a chance."</p><p>"Thats what I said." Asako added. "You should have seen the shade of red she turned."</p><p>Takata laughed at that. "Sounds like she is a little self counscious." he said.</p><p>Asako nodded as she picked up her tea. "Definitely." she said. "But I was kind of surprised, she came in by herself, without her sister or anybody else with her."</p><p>"Hm. She sounds kinda like Kenji." Takata said.</p><p>"In some way's she is, in some ways she isn't." Asako replied. "She's as tall as he is, but some more meat on her than he does."</p><p>"That don't take much." Takata said with a laugh. "Kenji's way too skinny."</p><p>"Speak for yourself." Asako said, nodding at Takata's bony frame. "Thats why I brought this." she added, patting the box lunch. "You'll need your energy."</p><p>"Whats with all the concern on why Kenji and I eat?" Takata asked as he set his teacup down. "First Naota's sister and wife, now you."</p><p>"Easy." Asako said as she handed the box lunch to Takata. "You're just so cute and adorable that we cant help but take care of you."</p><p>Arching an eye brow Takata opened the lunch. 'So that's why." he said as he took out a pair of chopsticks. "And man, this looks good."</p><p>"Enjoy." Asako said as Takata dug in. "Though you each have your own charms." she added.</p><p>"How so?" Takata asked between bites.</p><p>"Well, you have the tall, dark, and handsome thing going on." Asako explained. "And your little brother has the cute geeky charm thing."</p><p>Takata nodded as he munched. "I was wondering how he did that." he said. "But I'm still trying to figure out what the <i> hell </i> I was thinking when I married my wife."</p><p>"Her beauty?" asked Asako, arching an eyebrow.</p><p>Takata frowned, then shook his head. "No, I don't think thats why." he said. "Oh, wait a minute. Now I know." he said with a snap of his fingers. "Dad wanted me to."</p><p>Asako blinked as she looked at Takata in surprise. "Your <i>father</i> wantedyou to marry her? Why did you go along with it?"</p><p>Takata shrugged as he leaned back in his chair. "Easy. My dear father is an abusive asshole, and Kenji was still living at home at the time, and I wasn't there to protect him."</p><p>"Ahhh..." Asako said with a nod. "I see. And now that he's not living at home..."</p><p>"I'm gonna bail." Takata finished. "But I gotta figure out how to convince the courts to give me custody of the kids." he added, nodding at the frame set up on top of his monitor, showing two kids, a boy and a girl.</p><p>They obviously took after their father, being tall and skinny with a mischievous glint in their eyes. Both were seated next to Takata, and they were all smiling as they relaxed on the beach. Noticeably absent though, was their mother.</p><p>"oohhh... Nice kids." Asako said as she took a look. Squinting she leaned in and took another look. "Your soon is gonna be a terror among the ladies you know."</p><p>Takata laughed and nodded. "Takes after dear old dad." he said. "And I think that my daughter inherited the artistic genes that Kenji has.</p><p>"Really." Asako asked as she glanced out of the corner of her eye at Takata.</p><p>Takata nodded. "Yep. I gotta introduce her to Kenji one of these days, maybe he can teach her a thing or two." he said.</p><p>"Hm." Asako said as she refilled her tea. "So obviously your wife is someone you don't want to have custody of your children." she asked as she offered the thermos to Takata.</p><p>Draining his cup he held it out for a refill. "Pretty much." he said. "And to make matters worse her daddy is CEO of this corporation." he added as Asako winced. "But on the plus side, he <i>does </i> like me, and I think he feels sorry for me because I married his daughter."</p><p>Asako laughed as she put down the thermos. "But he'd still have to side with his daughter during the divorce, right?"</p><p>Takata nodded. "Uh- huh." he said. "And considering the caliber of lawyers he can hire, I wont stand a chance."</p><p>"So why don't you have Naota play with them?" Asako asked. "He is a ninja, and a tai -yokai to boot. Plus, you and he seem to be on good terms."</p><p>Takata thought about it for a moment, then nodded. "You know. You're right. I don't know why I didn't think of that before." he said. "When Naota gets back from his honeymoon I'll ask him."</p><p>Asako chuckled before taking a sip of her tea. "See, that's one good thing about knowing a ninja." she said.</p><p>"true." Takata said with a nod. "How can I repay you for that?" he asked.</p><p>"What are you doing for lunch tomorrow?" Asako asked.</p><p>Takata chuckled as he looked across at Asako. "I was going to have a business lunch, but I can reschedule them." he said. "You got anywhere in mind?" he asked.</p><p>"Not really." Asako answered with a shrug. "Whatever you have in mind." she said.</p><p>"Great." Takata said with a nod. "I know this perfect little place around here, great food, great atmosphere, and the best part is that it isn't one of those 'trendy' places."</p><p>Asako brightened at that. "So you mean it's actually real, not prepackaged?" she asked, getting a nod from Takata. "Alright. I'm game."</p><p>"Does twelve thirty sound about right?" Takata asked.</p><p>"Fine by me." Asako answered.</p><p>"It's a date then." said Takata.</p><p></p><p>End.</p><p>(1)It's a technique that artists use for proportion, i.e., if I were to draw Kenji and Matoko I would make them about 7 heads high because they are both a little over six feet tall, Lia would be 5 and a half heads because she's Five foot, Naota would be six heads because he's five eight, and so on.</p><p>(2) Genin: lowest rank in the Hagakure clan.</p>
