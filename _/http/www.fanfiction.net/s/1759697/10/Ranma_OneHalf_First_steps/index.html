</div>Ranma Onehalf: First steps Epilogue.<p>Thunder rumbled in the distance as Ukyo locked the front after the last customer of the day. As she locked the door she glanced up at the thunderclouds overhead. Drawing the blinds she sighed.<p>Wearily Ukyo began to sweep up the days mess. Normally she would hum a tune or have the radio playing but after seeing Ranma it all seemed...pointless.<p>She had spent a good part of her life chasing after Ranma Saotome, first for revenge and then for marriage. Despite all the evidence to the contrary she had always assumed that he would choose her.<p>Even after he had put her in intensive care for three months and then had disappeared with Akane she had still kept hoping. For over twelve years she had kept doing that. Then one morning she was practically kidnaped from her bed and had finally come face to face with reality.<p>She had watched as the marriage contract had dissolved and with it, a major part of her life. Ever since that day she had been getting up and running the restaurant like she always had, but she had just been going through the motions.<p>Tying the last trash bag she picked them up and walked to the back door. Stepping out into she walked to the dumpster with the trash, not really caring that she was getting soaked by the rain. As she walked over to the trash can she didn't notice a tarp covered bundle sitting in the alley.<p>Ryoga sat under his tarp and tried to keep warm. For once the weather was a perfect match for his mood. He was cold, hungry, and lost, but that was normal for him. As he sat there he wished that he could have something hot to eat and tried not to think about Akane. After what had happened the memories were just too painful.<p>Hearing a door open Ryoga looked up and saw Ukyo step out of the back door to her restaurant.<p>"So that's where I am." he thought. "I wonder if I can get a hot meal from her..." he thought as he sat up.<p>Only to have a stream of water come through a hole in the tarp and hit him in the back of the neck.<p>Ukyo jumped at Ryogas squeal and spun around to face the threat.<p>"Alright, who's there?" Ukyo demanded as she looked at the tarp.<p>Ukyo tensed as she saw movement under the tarp. As Ryoga crawled out from the under the tarp Ukyo sighed and relaxed.<p>"Ryoga, you jackass." she sighed as she shook her head. "Get inside. I'll heat you some water." she said as she pointed to the door.<p>Gratefully Ryoga ran inside the restaurant. Walking over to the tarp she tossed it aside and picked up his clothes. Grabbing a strap Ukyo dragged his pack inside along with his clothes.<p>After setting his clothes out to dry Ukyo put a kettle on and stood there in the kitchen and her and Ryoga looked at each other. As the water heated Ukyo noticed that Ryoga was looking more down than usual.<p>Taking a guess she decided to step out on a limb. "You found out about Ranma and Akane too, huh?" she asked.<p>Ryoga ernked slightly and looked down at the floor. Ukyo nodded in understanding.<p>"Yeah, me too." she said.<p>Checking the kettle she found it was hot enough and turned the gas off. Taking down a bowl Ukyo walked to the bathroom and put it on the floor. After filling the bowl she stepped out of the bathroom. As Ryoga came up she passed him in the hall.<p>"There's towels in the bathroom that you can use while I get you some clothes." she told him. Ryoga ernked in reply and headed into the bathroom.<p>After having laid out some clothes and some leftovers for Ryoga Ukyo headed upstairs to bed. Getting changed into her bedclothes Ukyo turned out the light and lay back in bed. Lying there she listened to the rain drum on the roof and the thunder roll.<p>"Twelve years." Ukyo thought as lightning flashed through the blinds. "Twelve years I searched and waited like a fool." she thought.<p>As thunder shook the building Ukyo rolled over and curled into a ball.<p>"Then Ranma shows up out of the blue with Akane and they're married and they have a kid."she thought. Closing her eyes tightly Ukyo curled up tighter into a ball. "And now every morning I get to remind myself of that when I look in the mirror."<p>Lying there she pulled the cover over her head and waited for slumber to overtake her.<p>"I wish I could just disappear." she thought. "Ryogas got that down to a science." she thought wryly.<p>A large flash of lightning lit up the room and a huge crash of thunder shook the building as Ukyo sat up in bed.<p>"That's it." she said as the thunder died away.<p>Ryoga woke early the next morning and began to roll up his sleeping bag. As he did that footsteps on the stairs made him look up.<p>"Good morning." he said to Ukyo.<p>"Good morning." she returned. Entering the kitchen she turned on the lights. "You wanna stay for breakfast? There's something I want to talk to you about." she said from the kitchen.<p>Salivating at the prospect of a homemade breakfast Ryoga nodded. "Yes, thank you." he said.<p>As Ukyo whipped up a quick breakfast for the both of them Ryoga made tea for the both of them. "You said you wanted to talk to me." he said.<p>"Yeah." Ukyo said as she dished up their breakfast.<p>Sitting down next to him Ukyo handed Ryoga his bowl and he dug in. Ukyo said as she sat and looked at her breakfast.<p>"I want to leave Nerima." she told him.<p>Ryoga gave her a funny look as he chewed. Swallowing he spoke. "Why? You've got a successful business and a large crowd of customers." he said.<p>"And a few blocks away from here is Ranma and Akane and their daughter, that's why. I'd rather not be reminded of that every day." she said as she picked at her food.<p>"What about your marriage contract? You do have a valid claim." Ryoga pointed out as he picked up his tea.<p>Ukyo sighed and looked away. "It was dissolved." she replied.<p>Ryogas eyebrows shot up at his admission. "What? How?" he asked.<p>"They kidnaped me and my father and made him and Genma do it." she said.<p>"Oh." Ryoga answered.<p>Ukyo looked up at him as she picked up her tea. Narrowing her eyes she spoke.<p>"What about you? You're taking this awfully well." she said.<p>"Huh? What are your talking about?" Ryoga asked as he looked up.<p>"Your not ranting and raving about Akane or in a near -suicidal depression." she told him.<p>"Oh. Well..." Ryoga began. He stared at the counter in front of him for several moments before replying. "I-I ran my mouth in front of Akane and I sorta spilled my secret." he said.<p>Ukyo looked at him quizzically. "Sorta spilled your secret? What did you do? Admit that you were P- chan?" she asked him.<p>Ryoga hung his head. "Yes." he admitted.<p>Ukyo rolled her eyes. "Ryoga you dumbass..." she groaned.<p>"That's Ranma said." Ryoga added.<p>Ukyo shook her head and looked at him. "How did Akane take it?" she asked.<p>Ryoga rested his head on the counter. "She turned me into human origami and stormed off." he said.<p>Ukyo winced in sympathy. "Ouch. Still, she took it pretty well I'd say." she said.<p>Ryoga looked up at Ukyo. "What makes you say that?" he asked.<p>"You're still breathing." she pointed out to him.<p>"Oh." he said.<p>Ukyo sipped her tea. "Anyways, as I was saying I want to leave Nerima. And I want your help." she said.<p>"My help?" Ryoga asked, puzzled.<p>"Yes, your help. I want to get lost, permanently and you're the best way to do that." she said.<p>"So you want to be my traveling companion?" he asked.<p>"Yes." Ukyo answered.<p>Ryoga looked at her and saw that she was serious. As he ate his breakfast and drank his tea Ryoga considered her offer. As he thought about it he realized why he had become enamored of Akane in the first place.<p>It had been because he was lonely and the one thing that he really feared above all else was loneliness. After a few long moments he came to a decision. Ryoga nodded as he put down his tea. "Okay. You can come." he said.<p>"Thanks." Ukyo said as she began to eat her breakfast.<p>"On one condition." he added.<p>Ukyo looked up from her meal at him. "What?" she asked.<p>"Whenever we get near the Tendos you steer me away. Akane hates me now and I don't want her to see me." he explained.<p>Ukyo nodded in understanding. "Deal." she said.<p>After finishing their breakfasts Ukyo wrote a note to the landlord and went upstairs and dragged out her back pack. She gathered up the essentials she'd need and was quickly packed. Putting a note on the door announcing that she was closed permanently Ukyo and Ryoga walked off into the street and into oblivion.<p>As Mousse walked along the path in the park he looked around him at the scenery. He had just made a delivery and was killing time as he waited for his next order to come in. Walking along a flash of purple caught his eye.<p>Looking closer he was surprised to see that it was Shampoo, and she seemed to be crying.<p>"Looks like Saotomes plan worked."he thought as he drifted closer to her. "Either that, or the fool got himself killed." he added as an afterthought.<p>As he approached he confirmed that Shampoo was indeed crying. Stopping several feet away from her he tucked his hands inside his sleeves and composed himself.<p>"Shampoo." he called.<p>Shampoo looked up and around for a second before she spotted him. She blinked away her tears and her face settled into a scowl as she recognized him.<p>"What are you doing here, Mousse? Are you here to gloat over my failure as an Amazon?" she said in Chinese. "Or do you think that you have a chance of marrying me now that the Kiss of Marriage has been removed?"<p>Mousse blinked in surprise. "Your speaking Chinese." he said.<p>Shampoos scowl deepened. "Yes. Since I don't have a husband to chase anymore Grandmother said I'm no longer required to speak Japanese." she said. Eyeing him suspiciously she continued. "So I'll ask you again: why are you here?" she asked.<p>"Because I saw you crying and was concerned." Mousse said with a slight bow.<p>Shampoo sniffled as she sat up strait and wiped away the tears that still flowed. "Why are you concerned about me? You left the tribe almost ten years ago." she said.<p>Mousse was silent for several moments while he considered his reply. Finding one he took a breath and spoke.<p>"I was concerned because I care about you as a person, Shampoo. And I left because I know exactly what you're going through." he told her.<p>Shampoo blinked in surprise as he continued.<p>"You're not the only one who has had everything they know taken away from them. And I have moved on Shampoo. It was not easy or painless. I still have nightmares occasionally and I still wish that I was able to marry you on occasion." he said.<p>Walking forward he withdrew his hands from his sleeves and handed Shampoo a business card.<p>"Here is my card. If need to talk, call me. My cell number is on there." he said.<p>Bowing to her, he turned and walked off into the park. She watched him go until he reached the edge of the park and disappeared into the crowds. As she sat there Shampoo glanced down at the card.<p>Muu Tsuu, Courier. It said in plain kanji.<p>Flipping it over she saw a phone number printed in the same plain text. Holding the card she considered throwing it away but decided to put in her pocket instead.<p>Leaning against the bench Shampoo realized that she didn't feel like crying anymore. However, she did realize that she had a lot to think about.<p>End Ranma Onehalf: First steps.<p>Authors note: Don't worry, this is not the end of Ranma Onehalf: First steps. I'm right now putting together the storyline for Book Two, so keep your eyes open.<p>Also, I will working 'tweaking' Book One, especially Chapters Four and Five. I did originally write in a scene where Ranma and Akane discover that Ranmas pregnant, but I could never get it come out right.<p>After reading the reviews and pondering it I think I figured out what to do, so again, keep your eyes open. So keep reviewing and I'll keep writing.<p>And on to Book Two...
