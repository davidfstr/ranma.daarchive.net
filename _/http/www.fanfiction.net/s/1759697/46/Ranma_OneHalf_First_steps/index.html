</div><p>1Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter Three.</p><p>Lia shivered as a gust of wind blew down the street.</p><p>"Brrr..." she said. "I <i>hate </i>dresses."</p><p>"Well, they definitely aren't the best thing to wear in March." Matoko said.</p><p>"You said it." Lia said. "Guy are lucky. They get to wear pants."</p><p>"I don't know." Matoko said as they rounded the corner before Furinkan. "That jacket they wear doesn't exactly look comfortable to me."</p><p>"Yeah, but at least they don't have a draft coming up their legs." Lia grumbled.</p><p>'Well, as soon as we get the test results we can head home." Matoko said.</p><p>"Good. 'Cause I'm <i>freezing</i>." Lia said as her teeth chattered.</p><p>"You should see your tail." Matoko said as she glanced over at Lia.</p><p>"Huh?" Lia said as she looked over her shoulder. "Gaah! It's huge! It's bigger than Naotas!"</p><p>Matoko chuckled as Lia lifted her coat and tucked her tail underneath, muttering about cold weather and how she wished she had a certain cat demon to keep her warm.</p><p>Shaking her head they headed into the schoolyard, where the test results were posted on bulletin boards.</p><p>Lia grimaced when she saw the large crowd that was in front of then.</p><p>'Oh, this is gonna be <i>fun</i>." Lia said as they approached. "Keep an eye out for our test scores."</p><p>"I will." Matoko said as they entered the crowd.</p><p>Using her height to her advantage Matoko looked over the heads of the crowd at the billboards. As she scanned the rows of names she saw Kenji standing near the front of the crowd. He happened to be looking back at the same time and saw her.</p><p>Kenji waved quickly to her and then turned back, not waiting to see if Matoko returned his wave or not.</p><p>Lia and Matoko made their way through the crowd, pushing their way through the mass of bodies. Reaching the front Matoko discovered Lia had gotten separated from her, and when she looked to her left she found that she was standing next to Kenji.</p><p>"Kenji?" she asked.</p><p>"Huh- Matoko!" Kenji jumped when he heard Matoko speak. "H-hi."</p><p>"Hi." she answered. "I got those scripts done."</p><p>"Okay." Kenji said. "E-email them to me."</p><p>"I will." Matoko said as she looked over at the billboards.</p><p>They spent several uncomfortable moments standing there listening to the sound of the crowd and looking at the billboards with out really reading them.</p><p>"So..." Matoko said. "How did you do?"</p><p>"I -I passed." Kenji said. "Barely, but I passed."</p><p>"Congratulations."Matoko said.</p><p>"Thank you." Kenji said.</p><p>"How did Naota do?" Matoko asked.</p><p>"H- he was d-dead last on the list." Kenji answered.</p><p>"Oh." Matoko said.</p><p>Swallowing nervously Matoko focused and scanned the billboards. Looking for her and Lias names. She found their names and saw that they had passed, with scores putting them into the upper percentile of the class.</p><p>"You and your sister passed." Kenji said a moment after Matoko found their names. "Congratulations."</p><p>"Thank you." Matoko said. 'I'll pass on your thank you to Lia."</p><p>Kenji nodded, and taking advantage of a gap in the crowd escaped. Standing there Matoko watched him go until he was free of the crowd and escaped.</p><p>"<i>Well, he can speak to me." </i>Matoko thought as she turned back to the billboards.<i> "Thats a good sign." </i></p><p>Feeling someone poking her in the ribs Matoko looked down to see Lia standing next to her.</p><p>"Hey Matoko." Lia said. "Whats up?"</p><p>"We passed." Matoko answered. "Easily."</p><p>'Well, thats good." Lia said. "I saw you talking to Kenji."</p><p>Matoko nodded. "We said hello." she said. "He and Naota passed."</p><p>"How close was it?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Very close, for the both of them." answered Matoko. "I don't know about you, but I want to go home now."</p><p>Seeing her sisters expression Lia nodded and grabbed Matokos hand before leading her out of there.</p><p>"Okay Matoko." Lia said. "We'll go home."</p><p></p><p>Akane sighed as she sat down at the table with lunch on her plate and the remote in her hand. Turning on the TV she flipped to the news channel and turned the volume up slightly as she glanced at the clock.</p><p>"<i>They should be getting home right about-" </i></p><p>"Hi Akane."</p><p>"EEEEEK!" Akane screeched as she shot up like a rocket.</p><p>Lashing out with a kick Akane hit empty air as she spun around to she a smirking Naota crouched down behind her. They stared at each other for several moments before Akane spoke.</p><p>"D-don't <i>do </i>that!" she said, her voice slightly shaky.</p><p>"Sorry, but I had to." Naota said.</p><p>"What?" Akane asked as Naota stood up.</p><p>"I lost a bet with Akane." Naota said with a shrug.</p><p>"Oh." Akane said as she relaxed. "How did you do that anyways? You pick up the Umi -Sen -Ken from Lia? Or was it that shadow trick you just learned?"</p><p>"Shadow trick." Naota answered. "Plus my ninja training."</p><p>"Ninja training?" Akane asked.</p><p>"You never look up." explained Naota.</p><p>"Okay..." Akane said as the inner door to the mudroom opened. 'What was the bet about?"</p><p>"I forgot that Lia has a black hole for a stomach." answered Naota with a queasy look. "Thats all I have to say."</p><p>'So I take it you wont be needing lunch for the time being?" Akane asked as Lia and Matoko came in.</p><p>"He wont, but I will." Lia said.</p><p>"The leftovers survived Ranma I hope?" Matoko asked Akane.</p><p>"Yeah. They're in the fridge." Akane answered.</p><p>'Good. I had an idea on what to do with them for lunch." Matoko said as she headed to the stairs. "After I change I'll whip up some lunch for Lia and I."</p><p>"You want to lay down?" Akane asked Naota. "You don't look so good."</p><p>'Thats not a bad idea." he said. "But let me get out of this uniform." Naota added as he tugged at the collar.</p><p>"You know where everything is." Akane said as Naota headed to the hall.</p><p>After every body had changed they went back to the main room. Naota was lying down with his legs under the kotatsu(1) with Lia using him as a backrest with her legs tucked under.</p><p>Hearing a purr start up Akane looked over to see Lia scratching Naota behind the ears as she lay back against him.</p><p>"You two are disgusting." she said.</p><p>"No we're not." Lia answered. "We're comfortable."</p><p>"Your version of comfortable could be considered ileagle in some places." Akane said as Matoko came in. "And now that you're all changed and comfy, how did you do?"</p><p>"W all graduated." Lia said. "Matoko placed the highest, I was below her, Kenji was in the lower part, and Naota barely passed."</p><p>"You barely passed?" Akane asked Naota. "By how much margin?"</p><p>'last one on list..." Naota purred before curling around Lia.</p><p>"Your lunch." Matoko said as she placed Lias plate in front of her.</p><p>'Thanks Matoko." Lia said as her sister sat down.</p><p>"you're welcome." said Matoko. Glancing over at Naota she arced an eyebrow. "Someones comfy." she said.</p><p>"Lia warm..." purred Naota before he finally gave in and went to sleep</p><p>Matoko chuckled as Lia dug in and started purring. After finishing her plate Lia stretched and yawned.</p><p>"That was good Matoko." Lia said.</p><p>"Thank you." Matoko said.</p><p>"And now if anyone doesn't mind I'm going to take a nap." Lia said as she tried to get up. "Naota, let me up."</p><p>Naotas response was to mumble unintelligibly and put his arm around Lias waist. Realizing that she was not going to get up she shrugged.</p><p>"Okay." Lia said. "So I'm not getting up." she said.</p><p>Lying down Lia curled up, using Naotas other arm for a pillow. Feeling her lying down next to him Naota curled himself around her, his purring never missing a beat.</p><p>"They're like a pair of house cats, aren't they?" Matoko said, which got her a nyaow from Lia.</p><p>Matoko and Akane both chuckled and went back to their lunches.</p><p></p><p>A rocket whistled past Kenjis head as he dodged to the right. Ahead of him Kenjis opponent jumped backwards as he tried to bring his rocket launcher to bear.</p><p>Kenji kept strafing right as he turned to the left, describing an arc around his opponent. As his muzzle swept across his opponent Kenjis trigger finger twitched and his grenade launcher <i>chunked </i>as a grenade was sent downrange.</p><p>His opponents body bounced off the wall and landed with a meaty thump on the floor as Kenji whirled around, checking for threats as he ran for the nearest exit. He was two steps out the door when his screen went black and 'Game Over' appeared in front of his eyes.</p><p>Blinking Kenji snapped back to reality as he read the stats for the match, which clearly showed that he had 0wn3d his challenger.</p><p>"<i>r34/)y 2 b3 0wn3/) 4g4in n00b?(2)" </i>he typed into the chat bar</p><p>"<i>Gr34t t34ch3r 734rg0 has left the server" </i>said the chat bar.</p><p>Kenji sighed and disconnected from the server. As he closed down the game he regretted signing on with his title instead of an alias. Generally after the first game or two everyone realized this was the <i>real </i>'He who Ownz' and ran.</p><p>Only a few had stayed to test their skill with him and couple had actually proved to be a challenge.</p><p>One had been the 'Gr34t t34ch3r 734rg0', who had lasted a good five rounds before leaving. It was getting to the point that only the true Quake Gods would play him, but they were hard to find on the net.</p><p>Which brought Kenji back to his current problem: Matoko.</p><p>He had no idea how he truly felt about her, really. Part of him was overjoyed that a girl really was interested in him, while another part of him was terrified that a girl was interested in him.</p><p>Thoroughly confused, Kenji had tried to retreat into video games but that had failed. So now not knowing what to do he grabbed his sketchpad.</p><p>Flipping through his sketchbook, looking for fresh paper Kenji saw a sketch of Matoko. Pausing he looked at it for a few moments before continuing on. The next page had a sketch of Matoko as well, and the page after that did as well.</p><p>Over the next several pages there were several more sketches, ranging form quick roughs to a finished pieces. Stopping when he reached a full page sketch Kenji looked at the picture, which he particularly remembered drawing.</p><p>It was nothing special really, just Matoko reading a book with Christian curled up half in/ half out of her lap with Mamimi using him as a pillow.</p><p>What was special about the picture was the attention to detail, the way he had went over every shadow and fold.</p><p>Kenji looked at the soft curves of Matokos face and sighed as he realized the truth was staying him right in the face.</p><p>"<i>Okay. I do like her." </i>he thought.<i> "So now what do I do?" </i></p><p>Carefully closing the sketchbook Kenji set it on his drafting table and lay back on the floor. Staring at the ceiling he sighed as he pondered what to do.</p><p>"<i>And what do I want </i>to <i>do?" </i>he thought. <i>"I need some advice." </i></p><p>Getting up Kenji walked to the door and went downstairs to the print shop. Going through the back door he stepped into the back of the shop. Navigating his way through the machinery he found Kamone at his computer, monitoring the print run.</p><p>"Kamone!" Kenji said over racket of the machinery.</p><p>Kamone looked up and waved Kenji over to a nearby stool.</p><p>"Take a seat Kenji." Kamone said.</p><p>As Kenji sat down Kamone double checked the monitor and turned to Kenji.</p><p>"So what brings you down here?" Kamone asked.</p><p>"I have a question." Kenji answered.</p><p>"About what?" Kamone asked.</p><p>"About a girl."answered Kenji.</p><p>"Ah" Kamone said with a nod. "And this girl is one Matoko Saotome I take it?"</p><p>Kenji blushed and nodded.</p><p>"So whats your question?" Kamone asked.</p><p>"A couple of days ago she told me how she feels about me." Kenji answered. "She likes me, like Naota and Lia like each other."</p><p>"Okay." Kamone said. "Go on."</p><p>"And she asked me how I felt." Kenji answered.</p><p>Kamone nodded and glanced at the monitor.</p><p>"So how do you feel about her?" he asked.</p><p>"I-I-I d-do like her." Kenji said.</p><p>'So whats the problem?" Kamone asked.</p><p>Kenji sighed and looked down at the floor.</p><p>"Idon'tknowhowtotellher." he mumbled.</p><p>"What?" Kamone asked, cupping a hand to his ear. "I can't hear you over the machinery."</p><p>"I said I don't know what to tell her." Kenji repeated in a louder voice.</p><p>"Oh." Kamone said. "Thats easy Kenji. Just tell her."</p><p>"What?" Kenji asked.</p><p>"You heard me." Kamone said. "It's easy."</p><p>"T-thats it?" Kenji asked. 'Thats all?"</p><p>"Uh-huh." Kamone said. "It's what worked with Haruko." he added, nodding to the framed 8 x 10 photo on the wall.</p><p>"Oh." Kenji said dazedly as he got up. "E-excuse me. I have to go think." he said before walking off.</p><p>Kamone watched him go with a smile before turning turning to the photograph of his wife.</p><p>"Hard to believe, isn't it?" he asked. "Naotas getting married and Kenjis interested in a girl."</p><p>Glancing at the monitor Kamone checked the printers as Dokuohtei came into the back room.</p><p>"Kamone." he said as he went to a filing cabinet.</p><p>"Hey." Kamone answered. "Kenji was just in."</p><p>"Really?" Dokuohtei asked. 'What about?"</p><p>"A girl." Kamone said.</p><p>"What!" Dokuohtei said as he turned around. "You're kidding."</p><p>"Nope." Kamone said.</p><p>'So who's the lucky girl?" Dokuohtei asked.</p><p>"Matoko Saotome." Kamone answered.</p><p>"Lias sister?" Dokuohtei said.</p><p>"Uh -huh." Kamone said with a nod.</p><p>"Well, they'd make a good couple.' Dokuohtei said as he pulled out a file. "They work well together."</p><p>"And she's a good cook to boot, so maybe he'll actually put on some weight." Kamone said.</p><p>"There's hope." Dokuohtei said as he left.</p><p></p><p>"Ow!"</p><p>Ranma couldn't help but chuckle at the scene before him: Naota was standing in the middle of the dojo in a pair pf tuxedo pants with Akane bustling around him, measuring and pinning the pants.</p><p>Behind Naota Lia had Matoko and Kasumi bustling around her, fitting her for her wedding dress.</p><p>'Ow! Would you please be careful with those?"</p><p>"Oh, hush, you big baby." Akane said. "It's just a few pins."</p><p>"And you put one of them into the base of my tail!" Naota said.</p><p>"Sorry!" Akane said. "I didn't mean to."</p><p>'It's okay." Naota said. "And whats so funny?" he asked, looking up at Ranma.</p><p>"Nothing." Ranma said as Lia suddenly perked up, her ears fanning open for the best hearing. "Panda alert." he called out.</p><p>"<b>Panda!" </b>Lia said in English as she turned around.</p><p>"No!" Matoko said as she grabbed Lias tail. "Bad Lia! Not in your wedding dress!"</p><p>"<b>Panda!" </b>Lia repeated, pointing in the general direction of the front door.</p><p>"No, not in your wedding dress." Matoko repeated. "Kasumi and I just finished putting it together."</p><p>"<b>Panda!" </b>Lia said, waving her arms.</p><p>Ranma laughed as he stood up.</p><p>"I knew we should have got the spray bottle.' he said as the doorbell rang. "I got it."</p><p>Walking to the door Ranma opened it to find a panda standing there.</p><p>"Hi Pops." he said.</p><p><b>Hello son </b><i>flip </i><b>Wheres Lia?</b></p><p>"Oh, Matokos got her by the tail, so don't worry." Ranma said as he stepped aside.</p><p><b>Thats a relief </b><i>flip </i><b>Now I need to get some hot water </b>Genma signed as he walked into the mud room.</p><p>Ranma chuckled as Nodoka stepped inside behind Genma.</p><p>"Hi Mom." Ranma said.</p><p>'Hello Ranma." answered Nodoka.</p><p>"Why are you carrying the sword?" asked Ranma as he closed the door.</p><p>'Oh, I was going to show it to Matoko." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Okay." Ranma said.</p><p>"<i>I wonder if I should warn Naota?' </i>Ranma thought. <i>"Nah. He can handle it." </i></p><p>Genma was just entering the main room when there was the rumble of footsteps from the far end of the house. He froze for a moment, then with surprising agility for a panda spun around to make a run for it.</p><p>"<b>PANDA!" </b></p><p>Genma made three steps before Lia flattened him.</p><p><b>Help! </b><i>Flip </i><b>She's got me! </b></p><p>Ranma laughed at the sight of Lia, dressed in Naotas shirt, clamped onto her grandfather in a Saotome Panda Glomp ©.</p><p>"Or of course theres the chance that she changed." Ranma said as Nodoka stepped in behind him.</p><p>"Lia! Cover yourself!" Nodoka said when she saw Lia.</p><p>"Relax Mom, no ones gonna see her." Ranma said. "And she's covered."</p><p>"But you can see her-" Nodoka began.</p><p>"Mom, its okay." Ranma said.</p><p>Nodoka sighed and turned to Ranma.</p><p>"Wheres Akane?" she asked.</p><p>"In the dojo, with Kasumi and Matoko." Ranma said.</p><p>"Thank you." Nodoka said.</p><p>Glancing at Lia Ranma chuckled again as Genma franticly waved a sign at him.</p><p><b>Ranma help! </b><i>Flip </i><b>Get her off! I cant breathe!</b></p><p>"Settle down Pops. I'll get her off." Ranma said as he went into the kitchen. "Hey, who wants Pocky?"</p><p>"Nyaow?" Lia said as she sat up.</p><p>"If no one wants it..." Ranma said as he took a box down from the cupboard..</p><p>There was a <i>swish </i>and Ranma turned around to see Lia standing in front of him.</p><p>"Nyaow?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Here you go." Ranma said as he handed the box to Lia.</p><p>Pouring a cup of hot water from the electric kettle Ranma stepped into the main room.</p><p>"Here you go Pops." Ranma said as he handed the cup to Genma. Hearing a scream from the dojo he sighed. "Excuse me." he said.</p><p>Walking to the dojo Ranma stepped inside to see Nodoka chasing Naota around with the sword in one hand and a ofuda in the other.</p><p>"There a problem?" he asked.</p><p>"Nah." Akane said. "Everything s under control."</p><p>"Are you sure?" Ranma asked as he watched Naota scramble awkwardly out of the way.</p><p>'I'm good." Naota said as he ducked a slash from the sword. "I'm just trying to keep from tearing the pants."</p><p>"Okay." Ranma said.</p><p>Skipping backwards Naota dodged a thrust from Nodoka. Seeing that the sword wasn't working she flung the ofuda at him, hitting him square in the face.</p><p>Naota staggered backwards, snarling in surprise as the ofuda flashed into blue flames before turning to ash. Swiping the ash out of his face Naota glared at Nodoka.</p><p>"Would you please be careful with those?" he asked. "You could have set my hair on fire."</p><p>Nodokas eye twitched as she looked at Naota.</p><p>'Genma!" she yelled. "Those ofuda your brother gave me don't work!"</p><p>"Growf!" Genma answered.</p><p>"<b>Panda!" </b>said Lia right before the house shook from a Panda Glomp©.</p><p>"Well, looks like its time for Christian and Mamimi to start getting fitted." Akane said.</p><p>'I'll get em." Ranma said.</p><p>"They're here?" Nodoka asked as she sheathed her sword. "I didn't see them."</p><p>'They're upstairs taking a nap." Akane said. "They're sleeping off Kasumis and Matokos cooking."</p><p>'Ah."</p><p></p><p>The clattering of typing filled the apartment as Bre sat at the table with her laptop. She was the only one home, with Kamone and Dokuohtei at the shop and so was using the free time to get some of her lessons done.</p><p>The sudden chiming of her cell phone interrupted Bres work. Scowling she picked it up and checked the display, which read 'Evans'. Flipping it open she pressed the talk button and put it to her ear.</p><p>"Hello." Bre said.</p><p>"Hey." Evans said.</p><p>'Whats up?" asked Bre.</p><p>"I was thinking about how Lias getting married, right?" Evans began.</p><p>"And?" Bre asked.</p><p>"And I was thinking that both Lia and Naota are going to need bachelor and bachelorette parties." answered Evans.</p><p>Bre perked up at the mention of the word 'parties'.</p><p>"Oh?" she said. "When do they want them?"</p><p>"Well... I was thinking that it would be a surprise." Evans said.</p><p>"I see." Bre said. "Does anyone else know?" she asked.</p><p>"Right now? Just you and me." Evans said. "Thats why I'm calling you. I need your help in planning this."</p><p>"Okay. I'm in." Bre said.</p><p>"Okay." Evans said. "Now to bring everybody else on board."</p><p></p><p>"Achoo!"</p><p>"Someones talking about us." Naota said as he glanced around the room.</p><p>"You think?" Lia asked as she rubbed her nose.</p><p>'Yeah." answered Naota. "Probably everybody in the dojo."</p><p>"Probably the panda and Grandma Nodoka." Lia said as she reached for the teapot.</p><p>"You'd think Christian would keep them occupied." Naota grumbled.</p><p>"Hey, he just woke up from a nap. He takes a while to get warmed up." Lia said as she poured herself and Naota a fresh cup of tea.</p><p>"Thank you." Naota said as he picked up his tea.</p><p>As he brought it to his lips he glanced down at himself and Lia.</p><p>"Whats so funny/" Lia asked.</p><p>"Oh, I was just thinking how things have changed." Naota said. "Think about how we would have reacted six months ago if we were in our current situation."</p><p>"Huh- oh yeah." Lia said as she looked down. "That is funny." she said as she looked at their current state of dress.</p><p>They were both sitting in the main room at the table, in their underwear. When Ranma hadbrought the half asleep Christian and Mamimi down, Naota had used his shadow technique to do a discreet exit with Lia.</p><p>"You think that they've noticed were gone?" Naota asked.</p><p>'Probably not." Lia said as screaming erupted from the dojo. "And Christ -chans just gotten warmed up."</p><p>"That should be entertaining." Naota said.</p><p>"More than likely." Lia answered. "though I wonder about the logic in bringing Grandma Nodoka in the wedding plans."</p><p>"Probably just to keep an eye on her." Naota said. "I mean, come on. She tried to slap an ofuda on me."</p><p>"That's rue." Lia said. "I don't know how were gonna deal with her when we're married."</p><p>'Aw crud, I forgot about that." Naota said. "I'm gonna have her as a mother -in -law."</p><p>"That's gonna make going to college interesting." Lia said. "And what about when we have kids?"</p><p>"Lets not get too far ahead of ourselves." Naota cautioned. "Lets focus on getting through the wedding, then college."</p><p>"Good idea." Lia said. "Hopefully that scholarship goes through."</p><p>"Ditto." Naota said as his ears twitched.</p><p>Naotas right arm blurred as he brought it up in a backhand. There was a smack of fist meeting flesh and a large panda blurred into existence behind them.</p><p>"And this conversation is <i>not </i>for pandas." Naota added as he glared at Genma.</p><p><b>But I just wanted to get some hot water! </b>Genma protested.</p><p>"By stealing it?" Lia asked. "Do I have to tell grandma?"</p><p><b>NO!</b> signed Genma as he started sweating nervously.</p><p>'Then scram." Naota said. "Or we get to see if pandas can scream."</p><p>Genma wasted no time fleeing the room.</p><p>"Damn, I wish I had grabbed our clothes." Lia said. "'Cause then I could have played Whack -a -Panda."</p><p>"Well, you're in luck cause you have your own personal Hagakure ninja at your service." Naota said as he flexed his muscles.</p><p>"Thanks for the offer Naota, but I think I can go up to my room and get my own clothes." Lia said with a chuckle.</p><p>"That too." Naota said.</p><p>Anything further was cut off by as Christian ran past them screaming, clad in only her boxers and followed closely by Mamimi with Akane right behind them.</p><p>"Christian Saotome get back here!" Akane screamed.</p><p>"And theres my cue." Naota said as he slipped into a shadow. "Be right back."</p><p></p><p>"Why are we at the back?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Because this way Hideo is in front of us." Naota said. "And I can keep an eye on him better."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said. "But I still can't believe Matoko is walking in front."</p><p>"Don't worry. Hideo wont try anything with her." Naota said. <i>"I hope." </i></p><p>"Somehow, that doesn't exactly fill me with confidence." Lia said. "He's tried to mess with Bre three times already, and thats after she kicked him the groin."</p><p>"He may be a perv, but he's not suicidal Lia." Naota said as he checked their 'six'.(3)</p><p>He was proved wrong an instant later when a gust of wind blew down the street and caused Matokos skirt to billow out, right in front of Hideo.</p><p>"<i>Me and my big mouth."</i> Naota thought as Lias battle aura flared to life.</p><p>"HENTAI!" Lia screamed at Hideo as she pulled her Mallet of Doom from Hammerspace.</p><p>Hideo for his part had already started out into a sprint, his survival instincts kicking in an attempt to make up for their earlier lapse.</p><p>"DIE!"</p><p>Which was fortunate for Hideo as a chi -enhanced mallet strike from Lia cratered the concrete where he had been standing a second ago. He was was wasting no time in putting as much distance between himself and Lia as possible.</p><p>Growling with rage Lia took off after him, her battle aura glowing bright as she charged ahead. Sighing Naota glanced at his watch.</p><p>"Huh. What do you know. He is getting better." Naota said to himself. "It took him thirty minutes to get a woman homicidally enraged at him this time."</p><p>Glancing up Naota got a look at Kenjis face, which had a look that he knew well. It was the look Kenji had when someone tried to camp on his spawn point.</p><p>"<i>Looks like Kenjis made up his mind about Matoko." </i>thought Naota. <i>"I think I'll ask him about it later."</i></p><p>"Hey Naota, isn't that Bre and Evans?"</p><p>Matokos question snapped Naota back to reality. Looking around he saw his sister and Evans walking along the street.</p><p>"Why yes it is." Naota said. "And for some reason that makes me want to kill Evans."</p><p>"Are you developing brotherly instincts Naota?" Matoko asked as she gave Naota a sly look.</p><p>"Apparently I am." Naota answered as he tracked Evans, zeroing in on the back of his head. "And if anyone doesn't mind, I think I'll go keep track of them."</p><p>'Well before you go, bear in mind Hideo <i>is </i>running for his life away from your mate." Matoko said. "And Hideo <i>is </i>your friend."</p><p>Naota winced and ground his teeth together as he realized that Matoko was right.</p><p>"Arrgh..." Naota groaned. "He's gonna owe me for this."</p><p>Shaking his head Naota took off in the direction that Lia and Hideo had gone, following the craters left by Lias mallet.</p><p>It didn't take him long to catch up to them. He had only gone a few blocks when he heard Lia scream 'Pervert Smasher", which was followed by a flash and a bang.</p><p>Naota saw Hideo go flying up into the air in a perfect ballistic arc to land in a canal six blocks over.</p><p>"Thats a ten if I ever saw one." Naota said to himself. "Now wait for it, and... <i>there.</i>"</p><p>Naota grinned as he saw Lia bounding across the rooftops in the direction that Hideo flew, mallet in hand. Ducking into an alley he dove into the shadows and exited out into the shadow of a rooftop AC unit.</p><p>It took him only a few quick bounds to catch up to Lia, grab her around the waist and skid to a stop.</p><p>"Hey! Leggo!" Lia said as she tried to flail her way free. "He's gonna get away!"</p><p>"Calm down Lia. He's learned his lesson." Naota said as he held onto Lia. "Any more and you'll hurt him."</p><p>"That's the general idea Naota." Lia growled.</p><p>"Lia..." Naota said as he enveloped her in a hug.</p><p>"Naota, let go. He's gonna get...away...oh, hell." Lia said as she tried to struggle against Naotas hug but failing.</p><p>Going limp Lia released her mallet back into Hammerspace. Leaning back into Naotas embrace Lia began to purr. Holding onto Lia Naota inhaled her scent.</p><p>Naotas ear twitched as he picked up the faintest sound of movement behind them. In a single movement he had spun around and had his SOCOM out.</p><p>"Who's there?" he asked.</p><p>"Ah, hello to you too."</p><p>"Either identify yourself or get a bullet in the head." Naota said as he addressed the stranger, cocking the hammer back on his pistol for emphasis.</p><p>"Well, I'm-" the stranger began, but was cut off the sudden crack of a mallet meeting skull.</p><p>"Sorry about that." Lia said as she released her mallet back into Hammerspace. "Sometimes he gets a little overboard on the ninja stuff."</p><p>"He- He- He-s a <i>shinobi?</i>" the stranger squeaked as she pointed at Naota.</p><p>"Tell the whole world, why don't ya?" Naota groaned as he rubbed his head. "And was that necessary?'</p><p>"When you you start threating to shoot people, yes it is." Lia said as Naota got to his feet.</p><p>Naota grunted in reply as he rubbed the back of his head.</p><p>"So who are you?" Naota asked the stranger.</p><p>"Oh, I'm Asako Kawashima." she responded. 'Your mate knows me."</p><p>'You do?" Naota asked Lia, never taking his eyes off of Asako. <i>"Somethings not right about her. And I've smelled a scent like hers before..." </i>he thought.</p><p>"Y-y-yeah." Lia stammered. "S-shes the clerk who helped me buy those things you liked so much."</p><p>"What things- oh." Naota said as he got what Lia was getting at.</p><p>Asako chuckled as she watched the sight of a very lethal cat demon start blushing.</p><p>"So they worked I see." she said. "So, you two want to go somewhere and talk about it?"</p><p>"<i>WHAT?" </i>Lia and Naota squawked.</p><p>""About your being a demon." Asako said with a smirk. "I have some questions to to ask you, and tell a few things you should know."</p><p>"Excuse me?" asked Naota.</p><p>"<b><i>Things that will will keep you and your mate alive." </i></b>Asako added in Chinese.</p><p>"Okay." Naota said with a nod.</p><p>'Hey, what language was that?" Lia asked. "And what did she say?"</p><p>'That we should come with her." Naota answered. "In Chinese."</p><p>"You speak Chinese?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Actually, I speak Mandarin, Cantonese, Fuji an, and Taiwanese." Naota corrected. "Along with Korean."</p><p>Lia blinked as she digested that information.</p><p>'You know six languages?" she asked. "Including Japanese?"</p><p>'Yep." Naota said with a nod.</p><p>"SO WHY DID YOU NEARLY FAIL ENGLISH?" Lia screamed, her battle aura flickering.</p><p>"Because what they taught us in the classroom was nothing like what you, my sister, and Evans speak." Naota said as he waved his hand in a placating gesture.</p><p>"Thats no excuse." Lia growled. "Starting tomorrow, you're learning English."</p><p>Naota winced at the tone in Lias voice before turning around to face Asako.</p><p>"So, where do you want to go?" he asked.</p><p>"How about my apartment?" Asako asked.</p><p>"Where is it?" asked Naota.</p><p>"You're standing on it." Asako answered, pointing to her feet. "I heard you on the roof and decided to investigate."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>"So what exactly was it you wanted to talk about?" Naota asked. "And don't take this wrong way, but what are you? You don't smell human."</p><p>Asako chuckled as she set down a cup for her, Lia, and Naota.</p><p>"I'm a kitsune." Asako said. "Let me show you."</p><p>Asako closed her eyes, and the change began. Her hair went from black to red, her ears lengthened and sharpened into an elven point, and six(4) bushy fox tails sprouted from her rear.</p><p>Naota and Lia blinked at Asakos transformation.</p><p>'How -how did you do that?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Foxfire." Asako said as a flicker of blue -green fie danced on her fingertips. "It's how we kitsunes wreak our mischief."</p><p>"Ah." Naota said. "I see."</p><p>"And that brings me to the first thing I wanted to talk to you about." Asako said. "Your appearance."</p><p>"What about it?" Naota asked.</p><p>"It may be fine to wandering around Nerima like that, where everyone thinks you're just a cat boy or someone with a Jusyenko curse that got messed up." Asako explained. "But out side of Nerima and you'll attract attention. The wrong kind of attention."</p><p>"I know. Those damned shrine maidens." Naota said with a growl.</p><p>Asako nodded. "Those, and there are various groups of demon hunters out there too." she said. "And those brats out of Jubaan as well."</p><p>Naota nodded as Asako continued.</p><p>"And you'll attract attention from other demons too." she said. "You're a tai -yokai Naota. That makes you pretty high ranking, and others might see you as a threat."</p><p>"Others like who?" Naota asked.</p><p>"Well, for starters Sesshomaru, Lord of the Western Lands." Asako answered. "He's a dog demon who rules over most of the demon population in Japan."</p><p>"Huh." Naota said. "Does he know about me?"</p><p>Asako shrugged. "Probably. He has eyes everywhere."she said. "Thats why you should camouflage your appearance."</p><p>"How?" Naota asked, flicking an ear for emphasis. "My options are kinda limited."</p><p>"No they're not." Asako said. "Any demon can mask their appearance if they want to."</p><p>"I can?" Naota asked, surprised.</p><p>"Yes." Asako said. "Its something that we all learn when we're young. Didn't your parents teach you that?"</p><p>"I wasn't born a demon." Naota said with a shake of his head. "I was turned into one."</p><p>Asako blinked as she digested that bit of information.</p><p>'I...see." she said.</p><p>"Can you teach me?" asked Naota.</p><p>"No." Asako said. "The technique varies between types of demons, and even between levels of demons."</p><p>"Crud," Naota muttered.</p><p>"But for higher levels of demons, it's fairly easy, almost an instinct." Asako said. "So it should be pretty easy for you to do."</p><p>Naota nodded as he looked down at his hand and flexed his fingers, unsheathing his claws.</p><p>"So, about this Sesshy guy." Naota said. "Whats his normal way of dealing with a new demon?"</p><p>"With Sesshomaru it's either submit to his rule or be destroyed." Asako said. "Neither of which are acceptable to you, I figure."</p><p>"How did you know?" asked Naota.</p><p>"Easy." Asako said with a smile. "If you're a ninja, then obviously you're a member of those clans that the Tokugawa's foolishly thought they had gotten to submit."</p><p>"You know about that?" Naota asked cautiously. "How?"</p><p>'Silly kitty." Asako said. "I saw it happen. I had gotten my fourth tail when the Tokugawa's began their campaigns against the clans."</p><p>Seeing Naotas disbelieving expression Asako smiled and laid her hands on the table.</p><p>"Here let me prove it to you." she said. "Judging by the fact you carry that cannon, I'd say that you're a Hagakure. A member of your clan was instrumental in subduing the Seven Oboro Ninja and destroying the demons involved with the Tenth Year of Tensho Revolt."</p><p>Naota blinked and glanced out the corner of his eye at Lia, who was exhausted from using her chi attacks and was curled up fast asleep. Looking back at Asako he narrowed his eyes.</p><p>"The only ones who know the truth behind that revolt are us and the few remaining families of the Koga." he said. "Just by knowing that you mark yourself for death if the elders of the Hagakure School find out."</p><p>"By inviting you and your mate in for tea I mark myself for death from Sesshomaru." Asako countered. "But then again, you're exempt from the Hagakure, and I was playing tricks long before Sesshy -poo was even born."</p><p>"And how do you know about me and my clan?" Naota asked.</p><p>"I have a friend who's a nurse at the hospital where the guys you beat into a paste were sent." Asako said. "And she's the mother of one of your friends. I won't tell you who though."</p><p>"And your reason is?"</p><p>Asako smiled, her green eyes twinkling merrily. "It's no fun that way." she said. "But it'll be easy to find out who though. Just follow your nose."</p><p>Naota growled in irritation as he rolled his eyes. Chuckling Asako clapped her hands together as she looked at Naota.</p><p>"So. What else do you want to talk about? I don't know about you, but I have all night."</p><p></p><p>"Whoa!"</p><p>"Steady there, soldier." Bre said as she grabbed onto Evans shoulder. "I think we overindulged a little too much at that poker game.'</p><p>"Ya think?" Evans asked as he steadied himself on Bre.</p><p>"Lets get you home so you can sleep it off." Bre said as she turned Evans around. "Which way is your apartment?"</p><p>"Uhh..." Evans said as he looked around at the landmarks. Getting his bearings he pointed down the street. "That way."</p><p>"Lets go." Bre said.</p><p>With extreme caution the pair of them weaved down the street, laughing and talking as they staggered around. Reaching the corner Evans stopped and held up his hand.</p><p>'Whoa, whoa, whoa." Evans said.</p><p>"What?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Left." Evans said as he pointed.</p><p>"Thats your right." Bre pointed out.</p><p>"Sorry." Evans said as he switched hands.</p><p>"Are you <i>sure </i>you know your way home?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Yeah." answered Evans. "I've staggered home drunk plenty of times."</p><p>"Okay." Bre said. "But if we get lost..."</p><p>"I'm in for it." Evans finished.</p><p>"Yep." Bre said. "Now lets go."</p><p>"Lead on." Evans said.</p><p>The rest of the trip to Evans apartment was uneventful, except when they arrived.</p><p>"This is interesting." Bre said.</p><p>"The stairs? What about them?" Evans asked as he looked at them.</p><p>"Yeah. They're narrow." Bre growled.</p><p>"I can make it up." Evans said.</p><p>"Not like this you can't." Bre said. "Now lets do this one step at a time."</p><p>'Okay." Evans said as he grabbed the hand rail.</p><p>"Careful..." Bre said as they started up the stairs.</p><p>"Okay." Evans said.</p><p>With careful steps Evans made his way up the stairs with Bres help. Bracing himself against the door frame. Evans fished out his keys and unlocked the door.</p><p>"And we're in." he said as the door swung open.</p><p>"Don't fall." Bre said as she guided Evans inside.</p><p>"I won't."</p><p>"Okay." Bre said as she kicked the door shut behind them. "Where do want to go? Bed or the couch?"</p><p>Evans blinked as Bre winced at what she had just said.</p><p>"You might want to rephrase that.' he said.</p><p>"Yeah." Bre said with a nod. "Which one?"</p><p>'Bed." Evans said.</p><p>"Okay." Bre said she turned and helped Evans walk the last few steps to his bed. "There you go." she said as Evans collapsed onto the bed.</p><p>'Thanks Bre..." slurred Evans as Bre walked over the couch and sat down.</p><p>"You're welcome." Bre answered. "I'm beat."</p><p>Rubbing her forehead Bre shook her head and looked at Evans.</p><p>"I'm gonna rest here for a bit and then head home, okay?" she said.</p><p>Evans response was a snore. Smiling to herself Bre chuckled and leaned her head back as she sank further into the couch.</p><p>"Boy, this couch is comfy..." she said to herself as she closed her eyes.</p><p></p><p>(1)Thats a table combined with a heater. It usually consists of a frame that you put a quilt over and then a table top on that.</p><p>(2)'Ready to be owned again noob</p><p>(3)A habit drilled into him by his ninja training, and necessary when you're a cat demon living in Nerima.</p><p>(4)Kitsunes, or Japanese fox spirits have multiple tails, depending on how old and how powerful they are.</p>
