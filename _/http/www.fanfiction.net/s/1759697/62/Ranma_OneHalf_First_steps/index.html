</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First Steps.</p><p>Book Six.</p><p>Chapter Two.</p><p></p><p>Stepping off the back ramp of the C-130 Hercules, Evans saw the crowd of cheering families and smiled. It was good to be back.</p><p>True, it would have been nice if he could have puttered around a bit while he and Gatekeeper had been stateside, but that little fact had been classified 'eyes only' and code worded to boot. Not to mention the fact that <i>where </i>they had been, Cheyenne Mountain, was home to NORAD and the Stargate Command Center, and as a consequence there were any number of agencies that had assets there keeping an eye on the place.</p><p>So it wouldn't have done if a group of soldiers whose unit was supposed to based in Japan at Camp Zama had been seen going into one of the local watering holes- especially since their unit was a communications unit, tasked with coordinating with the JSDF.</p><p>That would have brought considerable unwanted attention to them, and Gatekeeper liked staying in the shadows. So they had stayed in the mountain, and had been shipped home under the cover of darkness, arriving back home to daylight and completely mucking up everyones sleep schedule in the process.</p><p>Yawning, Evans scanned the crowd as he walked towards it, looking for Bre. That had been the one thing he had been looking forwards to for when they arrived back in Japan. He'd missed her terribly while at the SGC, and was looking forward to just curling up next to her and sleeping-</p><p>A flash of light out of the corner of his eye diverted his attention from thoughts of Bre, and Evans looked in it's direction. Squinting, he could barely make out what looked like a yellow blob with two blackish looking blobs behind it hovering a couple of feet off the ground in the heat mirage coming off he tarmac as a faint buzz drifted over the wind and through the sounds of the crowd.</p><p>"What the hell...? " he asked himself as the blob came closer and resolved into a yellow scooter being chased by a couple of Hummers. "Oh no." he said when it clicked as to what he was looking at. "She wouldn't..."</p><p></p><p>A massive grin split Bre's face as she homed in on Evans, the motor of her Vespa (1) wailing like a banshee. It only took a few heartbeats before she was within glomping distance, and her grin got even bigger.</p><p>"Ikadatsemu!" she yelled right before launching herself off the Vespa, straight at Evans.</p><p></p><p>Evans was seeming rooted in one spot like a deer looking into headlights as his girlfriend slammed into him like a five foot four chain wearing cruise missile, knocking them both ass over teakettle as her now riderless Vespa plowed into a group of inattentive soldiers and scattered them like bowling pins, the impact sending it cartwheeling across the tarmac, nearly flattening Captain Mendez before coming to a stop on it's kickstand.</p><p>"EVANS! JUST WHAT THE <i>HELL </i>IS GOING ON HERE?" thundered a slightly annoyed Captain Mendez, who had just narrowly avoided getting flattened by Bre's Vespa as it had cartwheeled by.</p><p>"Mmmpf!" was all that Evans could get out, owing to the fact that Bre had locked lips with him. "Hmm mm grrhrmmm hrr!"</p><p>It took a moment for Mendez to translate his Sargent Major's muffled response. "Oh." his said, in a much calmer tone. "You must be his mythical girlfriend that we've been hearing about.."</p><p>Evans gasped for air when Bre broke the kiss and smiled brightly up at Captain Mendez. "Uh huh." she chirped. "I'm Bre Johnson." she added, extending her hand.</p><p>"Nice to meet you." the Captain said, shaking her hand. "And I'm sure that you and the Sargent Major have a lot to get caught up on, so introductions can wait." he added, straightening up as the two Air Force Hummers that had been chasing Bre finally pulled up(2). "And I'm sure that these Airmen would be happy to give you and the Sargent Major a ride back to the gate..." he said as they began to get out of the truck.</p><p>"Sir?" the most senior of the airmen asked.</p><p>"She's his girlfriend." Mendez said, gesturing to Bre, who had gone back to smothering Evans with kisses.</p><p>"Sir, she was speeding-" the airman began, but Captain Mendez interrupted.</p><p>"I'll take care of it, Airman." the Captain said. "Don't worry about it."</p><p>The airman hesitated for a second, then nodded. "Yes sir." he said, then turned to where Evans and Bre were. "You ready Sarge?" he asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Evans said, pushing himself up onto his elbows. "Lets go, Bre."</p><p>"Okay." Bre said, sounding somewhat disappointed at having her smooching interrupted.</p><p>"We can continue once we get back to my place." Evans added in a low voice. Bre brightened when she heard that.</p><p>"We can put your scooter in the back of our Hummer if you want to, Ma'am." the Airman in charge suggested.</p><p>"Oh, thank you." Bre said. "Let me get it for you."</p><p>"We can get it Ma'am-" the Airman started to say as Bre whistled and her Vespa kicked over and came to life.</p><p>Soldiers scrambled to get out of the way of the seemingly possessed bike as it's rear tire spun before it looped around and headed for the back of the Hummer, specifically the Hummer belonging to the lead Airman.</p><p>Said Airman was just starting to panic as the Vespa closed on a collision course with the truck, only at the last possible second, the Vespa clamped down with it's front brake and locked up the front wheel. This caused it to flip and land neatly in the open back of the Hummer.</p><p>Bre smiled when the Airman turned to look at her and was unable to voice any thoughts he might have had. "It's a well trained scooter." she said as way of an explanation.</p><p>"Don't ask." was Evans response when the Airman turned to him. "Just don't ask."</p><p>"Yes sir." the Airman said weakly.</p><p></p><p>The ringing of Takata's cell phone jolted him awake, and he reached for it instinctively, flipping it open and putting it to his ear before his brain was fully awake.</p><p>"Moshi moshi." he said.</p><p>" Mashida." the voice on the other end was was gruff and gravelly, one that Takata knew well. It was his father-in-law and boss.</p><p>"Mr. Nakatomi." Takata said, instantly straightening up even though his boss couldn't see him.</p><p>"Where the hell are you?" Mr Nakatomi demanded.</p><p>"I-I'm at a friend of mine's." Takata answered. "I stopped by to visit him and ended up missing my train, so I stayed the night at his place." he continued. "Is there something wrong? I can-"</p><p>"No." Nakatomi barked, cutting off Takata in mid-sentance. "Are my grandchildren with you?" he barked.</p><p>Takata's stomach knotted up with dread when he heard that. He had an idea on where his conversation was heading, and he didn't like it one bit. "Ah- y-yes sir." he stammered.</p><p>"Good." Nakatomi said. "Keep them there." he ordered.</p><p>"Y-yes sir." Takata said. "May I ask why sir?"</p><p>There was a growl on the other end of the phone that to mind the image of an extremely irritated ogre. "My disgrace of a daughter brought home another man last night, and I was making sure that my grandchildren weren't there to witness it."</p><p>"I see." Takata said, not at all surprised by this bit of news.</p><p>"You're not surprised by this." Nakatomi said.</p><p>Takata sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "No, sir." he said. "I'm afraid not."</p><p>Nakatomi chuckled cynically when Takata said that. "That's not surprising. You're marriage has been on the rocks for a while now."</p><p>Takata's jaw dropped open when Nakatomi said that. "Ah- ah- sir, how did you-?" he started to stammer out.</p><p>"I've been having my men follow my daughter around for years, to keep her from embarrassing me or my firm with any scandals." Nakatomi explained. "So, are you planning on getting a divorce?"</p><p>"Yes." Takata said after several seconds hesitation.</p><p>"Well, that puts me in an awkward situation." Nakatomi said. "I can't fire you."</p><p>"Sir?" was Takata's throughly bewildered response. "I don't understand."</p><p>"You're coordinating three of our top projects right now." explained Nakatomi. "If you go, those will come to a screeching halt, and it'll take years before they're back on track." he added. "And lets not forget the fact that you're one of the few people in upper management whose nose <i>isn't </i>brown."</p><p>"Thank you sir." Takata said.</p><p>"You're welcome." Nakatomi responded. "And on a personal level, I think you'd be a much better parent for my grandchildren than my daughter would."</p><p>"And that's the problem." Takata said. "You're duty is to side with your daughter."</p><p>"Yes." Nakatomi said. "She's going to want everything- not to mention you dismissed from your position."</p><p>"I imagine so." was Takata's response.</p><p>"There's not much I can do about the former, but I can do something about the latter." Nakatomi said.</p><p>"Sir?" Takata asked.</p><p>"I'm moving you to one of our subsidiaries in Nerima." Nakatomi said. "You'll still have your duties, of course, but you'll be out of the line of fire here at our building."</p><p>"Thank you." Takata said.</p><p>"You're welcome." Nakatomi said. "I'll be paying for an apartment for you as well. You're going to have enough troubles dealing with an office move and a divorce at the same time, the last thing you need is to have to worry about is an apartment."</p><p>"Thank you, sir." Takata said, the surprise in his voice.</p><p>"Don't thank me just yet." Nakatomi said. "You know that my daughter will most likely get custody of the kids, so-" he continued but was interrupted by Takata.</p><p>"Don't count on that, sir." he said. "I think I have a pretty good chance to keep them."</p><p>His father in law hesitated a moment before he responded. "Mashida..." he began "You <i>do</i> know what kind of lawyers my daughter is going to be hiring, right? They;re going to be the best in Japan."</p><p>"I have an ace up my sleeve, sir." Takata responded. "That's all I"m going to say."</p><p>"And you think it will work?" asked Nakatomi.</p><p>"Yes sir." Takata answered.</p><p>Nakatomi chuckled. "Okay, Mashida." he said. "When you use that tone, you are rarely, if ever, wrong." he added. "You pull it off, I'll give you a raise- a big one."</p><p>"Thank you, Mr Nakatomi."</p><p></p><p>Major Johnathan Winters wasn't the type of person to stand out in the crowd, usually. At five eight and a hundred and eighty five pounds, if anything he was below average, especially with his clean shaved appearance and chestnut brown hair helping.</p><p>But, in some situations, like the one he was in now, his looks were anything but average, for he was in Japan this particular day. Specifically, he was on "vacation", or at least that's what his cover story was. He'd been expecting a call on his cell reassigning him after what had happened in Qatar and Reno, but apparently GATEKEEPER'd had that well in hand. He wasn't the only one who's specialty was solving the impossible or unsolvable.</p><p>True, the media hadn't came out and said that it had been an impossible situation with reno and Qatar, in fact, (as usual) they had gotten the situation completely <i>wrong</i>. No, what had been happening was a bunch of giant robots had decided to fight it out with another bunch of giant robots on the streets of Reno.</p><p>That information he had gotten from his usual sources. What he'd seen the media reporting though, as a terrorist incident, had the fingerprints of GATEKEEPER all over it. Not that he had a problem with that- they were only following their oaths to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, from all enemies, foreign and domestic.</p><p>He'd worked with them before on several occasions, and he'd liked them as a whole. Hard working, dedicated, discreet, very well informed and very very <i>very</i> good. They were everything a-</p><p>Winters stopped and froze in place when he heard the fragment of a voice. Listening, he began to filter out the sounds of the city around him and quickly located the voice. It was a voice he recognized, having worked with it's owner several times before.</p><p>The owner of the voice was seated at an outdoor cafe at a table with a young lady dressed in what could only be the 'punk' style -a most undignified style for a young lady in his opinion- and there was a yellow Vespa parked in front of them.</p><p>He began to approach the couple and had only taken a few steps when Evans turned his head and glanced in his direction, and gave him a look the brought a memory to the surface.</p><p>For the briefest instant he was back in New York, and a face very much like Evans was staring at him through the trees and brush, warpaint visible even in the gloom of the forest, tomahawk at the ready...</p><p>"Major! Major Winters!"</p><p>Evans voice snapped him back to the present, and he returned the wave that Evans had sent him, and began to walk over to where the Sargent Major was sitting.</p><p>"Hello, Sargent Major." Winters said as he came up to them.</p><p>"Hello, sir." Evans returned as he got to his feet and extended his hand in greeting. "What brings you to Nerima?" he asked.</p><p>"Vacation." Winters answered as he shook hands with Evans, and his gaze fell on the girl who was still seated at the table. "And who's your friend, Sargent Major?" he asked.</p><p>"Oh." Evans said. "Major, I'd like you to meet my girlfriend, Bre Johnson." he said. "Bre, I'd like you to meet a colleague of mine, Major Johnathan Winters."</p><p>"Nice to meet you." Bre said, holding out her hand.</p><p>"Likewise, Miss Johnson." Winters said, gently shaking her hand. "So, you're not a perennial bachelor like everyone thinks." he commented to Evans.</p><p>Winters could hear Evans molars grind in irritation. "Why does everyone keep saying that? Is there a betting pool that I'm not aware of?" he grumbled. "Other than the ones Mac is running?"</p><p>Winters shrugged. "None that I'm aware of, Sargent Major." he said, glancing at his watch. "And it's been nice running into you, but I've got to go meet a friend, so if you'll excuse me..."</p><p>"I understand sir." Evans said. "Enjoy you're vacation."</p><p>"I will." Winters answered, and tipped an imaginary hat at Bre. "Miss Johnson." He said before walking away.</p><p>"<i>Huh." </i>he thought as he walked <i>"Evans got himself a girl. What's the world coming to."</i></p><p></p><p>Settling down at his computer, Naota booted up his browser and typed in an address. Hitting enter, he waited patiently for a second before a grey box popped up on his screen, demanding that he enter his user name and password. A few keystrokes later, and a list of folders popped up.</p><p>Scrolling down them, he selected one and it opened up into a sub directory. A few more clicks later, and he had the folder he was looking for. Nodding to himself, he reached over and connected a sterile(3) flash drive.</p><p>A minute and a half later, he had transferred the entire contents of the subfolder to the flash drive and had disconnected it. Another minute passed as Naota backed out of the site and logged out. When he was safely out of the site, he then reached up and flicked a switch, physically disconnecting his comp from the web.</p><p>Once that was done, he opened the downloaded folders and began reading.</p><p>It was several hours later before he looked up again.</p><p>"How was your nap?" asked Naota, grabbing the flash drive and turning to face his wife.</p><p>She shrugged. "It was okay." she answered, then looked at what Naota was holding in his hand. "Whats that?" she asked, nodding at the device.</p><p>"Flash drive." Naota answered, holding up the device and waggling it for emphasis. "I was downloading some info for a project I was hoping you could help me with."</p><p>Lia arched an eyebrow at her husband. "Project?" she asked. "What kind of project?"</p><p>Naota gave her an inquisitive look. "What do you know about 'chakra'?" he asked. "As in, manipulation of it."</p><p>"Chakra? Let me think." Lia said, scanning her memory. "If what your talking about is what I think it is, its a form of chi manipulation, specifically, it's when chi is melded with raw magic." she recited. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>Naota blinked a couple of times and looked at the flash drive in his hand, then back at his wife. "Because I managed to get scans of several of the Hagakure Clan's scrolls, and chakra is mentioned a lot in them."</p><p>"Huh." Lia said, and strode over to where Naota was sitting. "May I take a look at them?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said, scooting over to make room for her. "One thing though, please don't tell anyone about this. I'm not supposed to have these, and..." he added, getting a roll of the eyes from Lia.</p><p>"Why am I not surprised?" Lia asked rhetorically.</p><p>"Hey, I'm a ninja." Naota said defensively. "What did you expect?"</p><p>Lia sighed and looked over at her husband. "You know, the scary part is you're right. I should have expected this." she said. "Now hush. I'm trying to look at these."</p><p>Naota hushed and let her read.</p><p></p><p>"Well?" Naota asked as Lia leaned back and stretched, her vertebrae popping like corks.</p><p>"Well..." Lia began "It's what I thought it was. What the authors of the scrolls referred to as 'chakra' is the melding of chi and magic."</p><p>Naota nodded and set a mug of tea down for Lia. "Okay then, so how do I manipulate it?" he asked.</p><p>"You already know how." Lia answered, and took a sip of her tea.</p><p>Naota blanched at her seemingly flippant reply. "What?" he asked. "Could you say that again?"</p><p>Lia shrugged. "I said, you already know how." she repeated. "What do you think your shadow jumping is?"</p><p>"Ah-" Naota started to say, then stopped as several things fell into place in his mind. "Son of a <i><b>bitch!</b></i>" he said, getting an arch of the eyebrows from Lia. "I've known all along and didn't know it! I could be doing so much more..."</p><p>"I know the feeling." Lia commented. "I felt the same way when I discovered the sk8ter technique."</p><p>Naota nodded absently. "I can disguise myself... so I don't look like a cat boy all the time." he said. "I can blend in again."</p><p>Lia cocked her head to one side slightly. "Well, you are ninja." she said. "That is a very important part of your skill set."</p><p>"You can bet your tail on that." Naota said. "If your enemies can't see you, they can't kill you." he added, to which Lia rolled her eyes. "What?"</p><p>"I thought you were trying to get <i>away</i> from that stuff." Lia said, a touch of exasperation in her voice.</p><p>"Hey, old habits die hard." Naota defended. "Besides, just because I'm not doing missions for the clan anymore, does not mean that our clans enemies will take that into account."</p><p>Lia sighed and rubbed her eyes. "That's right. There are no innocents, as far as ninjas are concerned." she said. "Like when we are at the beach."</p><p>Naota nodded, a shadow passing over his face as he recalled the unpleasant parts of that fateful trip to the beach. "Yeah." he said. "Like then. But with this, I can keep things like that from happening."</p><p>Lia had to nod in agreement with the point that Naota had made. "That's true." she said. "So, what are you going to learn first?" she asked, jerking a thumb at the computer screen.</p><p>"Well..." Naota drawled "You remember how I mentioned that I'll be able to blend in again?" he asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said. "You want to learn disguise techniques first?"</p><p>"Actually..." Naota said, bringing his hands together and making a few signs with his fingers. "I think I've already learned one... <i>henge!"</i></p><p>Lia's eyes bugged out as her husband was briefly enveloped in a cloud of white smoke,which cleared to reveal him still standing there... but only now he was fully human looking, his stripes replaced with sleeve tattoos.</p><p>"Wow." was the only thins that Lia could think to say.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota agreed. "This is going to make things a <i>lot </i>easier."</p><p>"Definitely." Lia agreed. "Could you change back now? I like you with the ears and tail..."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said, the glint of mischief in his eye going unnoticed by Lia as he began to make the hand signs again. <i>"Henge!"</i></p><p>There was another puff of smoke, and when it cleared, his form had feline attributes again- with a few...<i> minor</i> changes. Like the fact that he was now a <i>she</i>.</p><p>And was naked.</p><p>"What the hell- Eeek!" was all that Lia got out before Naota pounced her.</p><p>"Well?" 'Naota' asked. "Is this better?"</p><p>"Ah-I-uh-..." Lia started to stammer, completely flummoxed by this.</p><p>Naota arched an eyebrow. "Not sure? Here, this might help a little..." he said, and then he kissed her.</p><p>At this point, Lia's thought process was along the lines of this:</p><p>"<i>Naota's a girl- no wait, he's </i>disguised <i>himself as a girl. So he's still a boy. Who just happens to look like a girl right now. </i></p><p><i>Dad changes into a girl when he gets splashed with water. And I've seen him kiss Mom when he and her were both girls. </i></p><p><i>So if it's okay for them to do that, why am I worrying about it?" </i></p><p>Once she'd spent the few seconds it took for her to reason things out, Lia purred happily and returned the kiss.</p><p>"I think I like it." she said when they broke for air.</p><p>"Glad to hear it." Naota said with a smirk, and began to nibble on Lia's neck.</p><p></p><p>Dokuhotei was firmly engrossed in his newest copy of <i>Icha Icha Paradise </i>when he heard the bell over the door open and, judging by the footsteps, Takata step inside. Marking his place, he looked up and saw that it was indeed the older brother of his grandson's best friend.</p><p>"Hello." greeted Dokuhotei Takata entered. "I thought you and the little ones would have been heading back home by now."</p><p>Takata shrugged. "Change of plans." he said.</p><p>"<i>Indeed." </i> thought Dokuhotei as he read Takata's body language <i>"He's tense. Somethings happened"</i> "So I take it you're going to be staying the night?" he asked.</p><p>"If you don't mind." Takata said. "I know it's kind of cramped-"</p><p>"I don't mind." Dokuhotei said. "The apartment is way to quiet for my taste." he added.</p><p>"Ah." Takata said, nodding. "Ah, I was hoping to talk to you, ah, about what we discussed earlier?"</p><p>"<i>Ah ha. I was right, there has been a change in his </i>situation." thought Dokuhotei. "I see." he said. "what happened?" he asked.</p><p>Takata sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "My father in law has figured out that I'm planning on divorcing my wife."</p><p>Dokuhotei nodded thoughtfully, and marked his place in his book. "I see..." he said. "That is a problem. Do you know how he got wind of it?"</p><p>Takata barked out a cynical laugh. "Apparently, he's been having my wife followed for a while now." he said. "It's his way of making sure she doesn't do anything that will embarrass him."</p><p>Dokuhotei arched his eyebrows when Takata said that. "He doesn't trust her? Interesting."</p><p>Takata formed a half smile and leaned up against the counter. "From what I've told you of her, do you blame him?" he asked.</p><p>Dokuhotei shook his head. "No, not really. If I was in his position, and had a spoiled brat like her for a daughter, I'd have her followed too." he admitted. "So, what did she do? Bring home another man?" he asked.</p><p>Takata nodded. "Yep." he answered. "Last night."</p><p>Dokuhotei frowned. "Faithful, isn't she?" he asked rhetorically, getting an amused snort from Takata.</p><p>"That's an understatement." he said. "Anyways, it gets better."</p><p>"Do tell." Dokuhotei said, looking at his teacup and frowning when he found it empty,</p><p>"Apparently, I'm too valuable to the company to fire, so he's moving me and my position to a subsidiary's offices here in Nerima, so I'm technically no longer with the parent company so he saves face." Takata related.</p><p>"Nice." Dokuhotei said as he reached for the teapot.</p><p>"Oh, there's more." Takata said as Dokuhotei poured himself a cup. "He wants <i>me </i>to get custody of the kids 'cause he thinks I'm the better parent, but doesn't think that I can pull it off." he said, pausing as they both shared a laugh. "And he said that if I do manage to get custody, he'll give me a big raise."</p><p>"Well, in that case, you're buying when we have the victory celebration." Dokuhotei said, and Takata snapped his fingers in mock irritation.</p><p>"Dammit, I should have kept that quiet." he said. "So, now that I've given you a head's up, now what do we do?" he asked.</p><p>Dokuhotei took a sip of his tea before he responded. "<i>I'm </i>going to be setting things in motion starting tomorrow, beginning with getting you a lawyer." he said. "<i>You, </i>on the other hand, are going to be spending time with your kids and you're going to tell them what's going on, got it?"</p><p>Takata nodded. "Yes sir." he said.</p><p>"And speaking of the kids, where are they?" Dokuhotei asked.</p><p>"They're at the Saotome Dojo, with Kenji." Takata answered. "I figured that was the best place for them." he said as there was a muffled shriek and thump from the ceiling. "What the-?" he asked.</p><p>Dokuhotei sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. "I know they're newlyweds and all, but if they keep this up, one of them is going to end with a broken pelvis." he muttered and saw Takata get a facial tic out of the corner of his eye. "Been a while?" he asked.</p><p>"One year, two months, thirteen days." Takata said, rigidly keeping his face blank.</p><p>Dokuhotei blinked a couple of times and got to his feet. "Dear God man, let me get you a drink." he said. "Is Scotch okay?" he asked as he rummaged in a filing cabinet.</p><p>"Make it a double." Takata said, his voice tight.</p><p></p><p>Evans sighed in relief as he stepped into the comforting confines of his apartment."Ahh... "However humble it may be, there is no place like home." he said happily, taking his beret off and hanging it on it's peg.</p><p>"I agree." Bre said, giving him a hug.</p><p>"Thanks." Evans said, returning the hug. "And now, I'm going to go get changed into something more comfortable."</p><p>"Hey, I thought only girls were supposed to say that line." Bre said as they separated.</p><p>Evans snorted. "I've just spent the last couple of days <i>living </i>in the same set of fatuiges, Bre." he said.</p><p>"Eew." was Bre's response.</p><p>"Hey, I changed before I came back home." Evans defended himself. "And I showered."</p><p>"I should hope so." Bre said as she removed her shoes.</p><p>"Of course it was a lukewarm shower because I made everyone else go first." added Evans. "But at least I wasn't one of the officers. <i>They </i>got the cold showers."</p><p>"I thought officers had their own separate facilities." Bre said, straightening up after stowing her footwear.</p><p>"They do." Evans answered, removing one boot and starting to undo the laces on the other. "But we were sharing with Marines, and everything was stretched to capacity. So the enlisted went first, then us NCO's, then the commissioned officers."</p><p>"Oh, okay." Bre said as she walked into the living room. "That makes sense."</p><p>"Yep." Evans said as he headed to his bedroom. "Is there still beer left?" he asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Bre answered, popping open the fridge. "You want one?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes, please." Evans said from the other room.</p><p>Bre had just brought the beer into the living room when Evans reappeared, dressed in an old t-shirt and sweats. "Much better." he said, taking the beer from hr and opening it.</p><p>"So, what do you want to do?" Bre asked as Evans opened his beer.</p><p>"This." Evans replied, and he sat down on the couch and pulled her down into a sitting position, before he stretched out on the couch with his head on her lap.</p><p>"I take it you missed me." Bre said.</p><p>Evans closed his eyes and nodded. "Uh huh." he said.</p><p>"Well, the feeling's mutual." Bre said.</p><p>"Mm-hmm." hummed Evans, getting an arched eyebrow from Bre.</p><p>"Are falling asleep on me?" she asked.</p><p>Evans said nothing in response, having indeed fallen fast asleep. Bre smiled in amusement and gently stroked his close -cropped hair. She was also slightly surprised when he began to <i>purr </i>slightly.</p><p>"Huh." she said under her breath. "I better ask the Kitty about this, see if the Neko Ken..." she mused, as she sat there and continued to gently stroke his hair until she too, fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>It was dark out when they were awoken by the ringing of the telephone, specifically it was his land line phone that woke up Bre.</p><p>"Moshi Moshi." she said sleepily, rubbing her eyes.</p><p>"Is William there?" the voice of an older woman asked on the other end in American English.</p><p>It took Bre a moment for her brain to get into gear. "Uh, yeah. Your his mom, right?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes." the woman answered. "And you're his girlfriend, we spoke the other day."</p><p>"Yeah." Bre said. "He's right here, let me wake him up for you." she added.</p><p>Bre heard Evans mother clear her throat slightly at her last sentence, but was too busy shaking Evans shoulder to notice.<p>"Evans, wake up." she said gently.</p><p>"Nnnh.." groaned Evans. "What is it?" he asked.</p><p>"It's your mom. She's on the phone." Bre answered.</p><p>Evans eyes snapped open when she said that, and he began to sit up. "Oh." he said. "Gimme the phone- thank you." he said as Bre handed it to him. "Hey Mom-" he started to say when he put it to his ear but was cut off.</p><p>"Ah, yeah I know it's been awhile since I last visited- Well, I've been busy-" he said. Bre winced as she clearly heard his mother yelling about his not calling her. "Yeah, I know, I should have called you, that was rude of me- I know, I should have told you about Bre- Mom, it's not what you think, I just got back from being on alert on Okinawa and we fell asleep on the couch- M<i>ooom...</i>"</p><p>This continued on for about twenty minutes before Evans was able to get off the phone.</p><p>"Well..." he said, turning off the phone "That went well."</p><p>"So I gathered. "Bre deadpanned.</p><p>"Question." Evans said.</p><p>"Shoot." was Bre's reply.</p><p>"Are you up for a trip stateside?" he asked. "Mom is insistent that she meet you."</p><p>"I have no problem with that." Bre said. "We can do it after the Kitten's honeymoon trip."</p><p>"Good." Evans said, taking a sip of his beer and making a face when he discovered that it was flat and warm. "I'll E-Mail her the good news."</p><p>"You're not going to call her?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Dad's gonna have a fit when he sees the phone bill." Evans pointed out. "Why make it worse than it already is?"</p><p>"Good point." Bre said.</p><p></p><p>also known as the Scooter of Doom</p><p>Being, of course, considerably slower than a Scooter of Doom</p><p>(3) That means it was new, out of the box, and hadn't been used before.</p>
