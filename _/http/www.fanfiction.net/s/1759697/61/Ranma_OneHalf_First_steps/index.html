</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First Steps.</p><p>Book Six.</p><p>Chapter One.</p><p></p><p>The mechanical footsteps of the TPCD mecha faded off into the distance as Naota and Lia materialized out of the shadows in an alley near the Sano Print Shop. He took a quick look around to make sure the coast was clear, and saw that the lights were on over the shop, signaling that at the least Kenji was home and up. Making a note of that, he then grabbed his mates hand and darted back into the shadows to reemerge at the back door to the apartment.</p><p>Putting his key in the lock, Naota unlocked the door and opened it to find Kenji comforting Matoko at the table with his arm around her. They both looked up when he and Lia entered.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Kenji asked as Matoko got up and began to fuss over her sister.</p><p>Naota nodded. "Yeah." he said as he shut the door. "We're okay."</p><p>Kenji gave Naota a long look. "You're not." he said as his friend walked over to the table and sat down.</p><p>Naota sighed and rubbed his eyes. God, he was tired. "No, not totally." he said, then looked at his friend. "How much do you know?" he asked.</p><p>"The news." Kenji replied, picking up the remote and pressing a button.</p><p>On the TV a video segment of the top news story began to play.</p><p>"Breaking news from the Three Flowers Mall in Jubaan, where two members of the group of magical girls known as the Sailor Scouts were killed and one was seriously injured in a fight with one of their enemies.</p><p>Police are not releasing any details, other than that they responded to reports of gunshots and discovered the Scouts there. However, anonymous sources from within the Tokyo Police Department have told this reporter that the one injured Scout was reportedly Sailor Mars, and the two that were killed are two previously unknown Scouts.</p><p>Those same sources also report that the police have no idea as to who or what could have did this to Jubaan's most prominent defenders. More on this as it develops.</p><p>This is Kokijiro Murashima, Channel 6 news."</p><p>"All I know is what I've been getting from the news." Kenji said as the program paused. "So, what happened?"</p><p>Naota sighed and looked down at his hands for a moment, then up at Lia and her sister. Lia's expression was that of stunned shock, while Matoko's was that of slight horror.</p><p>"Well, first thing, I didn't mean for that to happen." Naota said, pointing at the TV as he spoke directly to Lia. "Those two on the roof, they ambushed me. I shadow jumped up there and they were right on top of me-"</p><p>"Two scouts got the drop on <i>you?" </i>Kenji asked.</p><p>Naota laughed cynically and looked over at his friend. "They had a buddy with them, another Scout. Called herself the Guardian of Time. They were waiting for me." he explained. "She probably manipulated time so they'd be able to attack me when I wasn't on my guard."</p><p>Kenji nodded. "Okay." he said. "Go on."</p><p>"Anyways, as I was saying, I got attacked by them on the roof. The two I killed, they were right on top of me, and well," he sighed again "I am a ninja. I saw two threats and my reflexes kicked in."</p><p>"What about the one you injured?" Matoko asked, hugging Lia to her.</p><p>Naota frowned. "I snuck up on her." he said. "And surprised her. Tactical error on my part- I forgot she had an ofuda ready on her. I could have knocked her out and avoided having to hurt her."</p><p>"What did you do to her?" Kenji asked.</p><p>Naota held up his hand and flexed his fingers. Five wicked hooked claws unsheathed from his fingertips. "I swiped at her with my claws. Cut her legs off at the knees."</p><p>Kenji grimaced. "ouch." he said.</p><p>Naota nodded and retracted his claws. "Yeah. Thank God there was a nice large first aid kit there. I was able to use it to stop the bleeding." he said, then looked up at Lia and Matoko. "Look, I-" he started to say, but Matoko held up a hand.</p><p>"It's okay." she said. "We all know that you're not a cold blooded killer."</p><p>Lia nodded and separated from her sister. "<i>I</i> know it." she said, voicing the one worry that hand been on Naota's mind. "If you'd had another option you would have taken it." she added, walking over to him and kneeling down next to him.</p><p>"You got that right." Naota said, running his hands through his hair. "God, I'm so tired..."</p><p></p><p>Evans was in the mess hall grabbing a bite to eat when the alarms went off.</p><p>"The hell?" he asked aloud, his fork paused halfway to his mouth. "What is this, a fire drill?"</p><p>"It'd red alert!" one of the other NCO's -Siler was his name- explained as he scrambled out of his seat.</p><p>"Shit!" Evans swore as he scrambled out of his seat. "Lets go Machiavelli!" he said to the Staff Sargent who was chugging the rest of his coffee.</p><p>"On it Sargent Major!" Machiavelli said as he slammed his cup down on the table.</p><p>Both men joined the rush of people from the mess hall and ran out into the hallway. They were halfway to where Gatekeeper had set up shop when the intercom clicked to life.</p><p>"Sargent Major Evans and Staff Sargent Machiavelli to the Command Center, repeat, Sargent Major Evans and Staff Sargent Machiavelli to the Command Center." the female voice said as both men skidded to a stop and looked up at the ceiling.</p><p>"You have <i>got </i>to be kidding me." SSGT Machiavelli said in an irritated tone.</p><p>"They're not, Machiavelli." Evans said. "We better get our butts up there."</p><p>"Yes sir." Machiavelli said as they turned on their heels and ran back the way that they had come. "What do you think they want with us up in the command center?" he asked.</p><p>"Hell if I know." Evans said as he and Machiavelli piled onto a elevator. 'We'll find out when we get there."</p><p>Seven minutes later Evans and Machiavelli were in the SGC Command center and found to their surprise that Captain Mendez was there along with SG-1.</p><p>"You summoned us, sir?" Evans said as he saluted.</p><p>"Yeah." Mendez replied as he turned to face the two sergeants. "The shit just hit the fan Evans."</p><p>"I kind of figured that, what with all the alarms and people running, sir." Evans pointed out. "What do you need me and Machiavelli for, sir?"</p><p>Captain Mendez pointed to a couple of a spare terminals. "The Decepticons are making an attempt on the Cube." he said. "You two are going to be giving our assets in the area real time intel."</p><p>Both men momentarily snapped to attention. "Yes sir." they said before walking over to the terminals. "Machiavelli, I have the Spec -fours, and the independents, you have the regulars."</p><p>"Yes sir." SSGT Machiavelli responded.</p><p></p><p>Bre was curled up on the couch, half asleep, with the television tuned to CNN and the volume low when the chatter of the regular news show cut out momentarily. Flicking open one eye she looked over at the TV and saw main news anchor had a serious face on and there was a graphic reading 'Breaking News' over one of shoulders.</p><p>Opening both of her eyes Bre sat up and turned the volume up a little so she could better hear what he was saying.</p><p>"-and at this time we do not know who the perpetrators of this are. Again, there is an ongoing terrorist incident in Reno, Nevada. Explosions and gunfire have been reported- hold on." the anchor said, putting a hand to his hear where his ear piece was. He listened for a few seconds before resuming speaking. "This just in, we have received reports that there are military personnel on the ground engaged in some sort of operation."</p><p>Wide awake now, Bre got up off the couch to kneel in front of the TV so she could listen. On screen the anchor was continuing with his report. "Hold on, we've got one of our reporters from a local affiliate, Anne Karrison on the line to fill us in." he said, looking into the camera. "Anne, you're there on the scene. What's going on?"</p><p>There was scratchy static as the line was spiced into the broadcast audio. "It's pandemonium and chaos here in Reno this morning." the reporter began. "There's fire, smoke, explosions-" as if on cue there was the <i>thump </i>of an explosion in the back ground. " -anyways, the damage is incredible."</p><p>The anchor nodded and a questioning look came on his face. "Anne, do you know who the authorities think is responsible?" he asked.</p><p>"This is going to sound strange, but you wouldn't believe me if I told you." Anne replied.</p><p>"What do you mean?" the anchor asked.</p><p>"Well..." the reporter trailed off for a second as she tried to figure out the best way to put what she had to say "They're giant robots."</p><p>"You're kidding." the anchor responded.</p><p>"I wish I was." Anne told him. "We're sending you some footage now so you and the viewers can see what I mean."</p><p>The anchor nodded again. "Okay, while we're waiting for that to come in, we've heard reports that there are military personnel already there, is that true Anne?" he asked.</p><p>"That is true." Anne confirmed. "I have seen military personnel here in combat gear- wait, hold on." she said.</p><p>Bre leaned forward and listened as she heard the reporter arguing with someone out of microphone range. All she was able to make out was the reporter saying "freedom of the press' then the audio cut out with a snap.</p><p>Bre felt her stomach tighten into knots as the anchor tilted his head slightly. "Anne, are you there?" he asked. "Anne?"</p><p>Not getting a response he turned back to the camera. "Apparently, we have lost contact with our reporter ." he said as Bre felt a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>She jumped and looked behind her to see Kamone standing over her with a worried look on his face.</p><p>"You okay?" Kamone asked.</p><p>Bre shook her head and pointed at the TV. "N-no." she said. "There's something going on in Reno and I know he's involved in it."</p><p>Kamone set his jaw and looked at the TV where the anchor was continuing to talk. "I'm sure he's safe." he said, patting her on the shoulder. "But you have every right to be worried." he added. "You want some company?" he asked.</p><p>Bre nodded as she shifted her attention back to the TV.</p><p></p><p>Evans paused for a second as the feeling that somewhere, <i>someone</i> was talking about him.</p><p>"You there Evans?" the voice of Jill Valentine said in his headset.</p><p>Snapping his attention back to the situation at hand, Evans responded. "Yeah, I'm here." he said. "You take care of that reporter?" he asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Valentine responded. "All I had to do was put a couple of round through the camera and she got the hint."</p><p>"Good." Evans said. "Got an update for you. The primary is running up the street one black over from you. Follow him."</p><p>"Copy that, Evans." Valentine said. "Will let you know when we have visual, over."</p><p>"Copy that Valentine. Out." Evans confirmed as he clicked on the live satellite feed of Reno, Nevada. In the downtown area there was a pall of smoke and the glow of fire, along with dozens of wrecked cars.</p><p>From what he could see of the streets and the reports he had been getting from his assets on the ground,</p><p>there were, thankfully, almost no civilians in the immediate area. Unfortunately, the cause of all this destruction was in the hands of one Mr Witwike, who was currently running from the Decepticons and carrying the Cube, an alien device of fantastic power.</p><p>Witwike was trying to get to a rendezvous point so he and the Cube could be ferried by helicopter to someplace safe. And to do that, he had to be someplace where there <i>wasn't</i> a massive firefight going on between Spec -4s and giant robots. Which was full of civilians who hadn't gotten evacuated the area even though there was gunfire and explosions just a few blocks away.</p><p>Evans gnashed his teeth and despaired for the future of his country at the display of mass stupidity.</p><p>"Evans! We have visual of the primary!" Valentine's voice cut in.</p><p>"Copy that, Valentine." Evans said. "What's his status?"</p><p>"He's running and- HOLY SHIT!" Valentine said before swearing suddenly.</p><p>"What is it?" Evans asked.</p><p>"That kid, he just bumped a soda machine with that box he's carrying and now its... transforming." Valentine answered.</p><p>Evans eyes widened when he heard that. "Take it down!" he said, his voice rising. "Take it down <i>NOW!</i>"</p><p>"Right!" was Valentine's response. A moment later there was the <i>fwoosh</i> of a rocket launcher followed by an explosion. "I- its down."</p><p>"Good." Evans said. "Keep after the kid, and if any more things transform, take 'em down."</p><p>"Copy that." Valentine said.</p><p></p><p>When he looked at the clock, Naota realized that there was about an hour to go before dawn. Sighing, he rubbed his eyes and looked down at where Lia was curled up on their futon, sleeping peacefully.</p><p>For him, however, sleep had not been so easy in coming. Not that he had wanted to go to sleep- whenever he closed his eyes, Naota kept seeing those two Scouts he had shot, the moment of their deaths replaying endlessly in his mind.</p><p>"<i>God, what a mess I'm in..." </i>Naota thought and cast a quick glance upwards at the heavens, and when he lowered his gaze he found himself looking at the clock again. <i>"Father Fukida is probably up and at the confessional by now..." </i> he thought.</p><p>On impulse, inspired by the thought of the good Father, Naota got to his feet and padded over to his dresser. Opening a small brushed aluminum box, he saw his crucifix lying inside, glinting slightly in the early morning sunlight.</p><p>Taking a breath to steel himself, Naota reached into the box and jerked his hand back when his fingertips brushed the cross. Sighing in defeat, Naota quietly closed the lid on the box and turned to look out the window where the skyline was lightening, heralding the advance of the sun.</p><p>"<i>Still cant touch it." </i>he thought. <i>"Which means that I cant go, even though I want to..." </i></p><p>Sighing again, Naota drummed his fingers on the dresser as he pined for a clear conscious.</p><p>"<i>Well, I could go..." </i> he mused darkly. <i>"But it would hurt. A </i>LOT.<i>" </i>he added, then his brows furrowed as he continued on that train of thought. <i>"Just how bad do I want a clear conscious? Which is worse, the pain, or..."</i> he looked back at the box again <i>"Or not keeping the faith?" </i></p><p>For several long moments Naota pondered this question, then finally reached an answer. Grabbing a pair of pants and a shirt, he slipped into the living room to change. Leaving his sweats in the hamper, he wrote a brief note to Lia explaining that he had stepped out to run an errand, then quietly slipped out of the house.</p><p></p><p>When the man yelled the missile warning everything in the SGC went quiet, the whole room holding their collective breath, hoping, wishing, <i>willing</i> the guys in the chopper to make. There was a mass of voices yelling as they tried to do the impossible, but while a UH-60 can do many things, it can't evade a missile from a dead hover.</p><p>There was a bang and several members of the SGC command staff flinched and cringed while there was a brief second and a half of screaming from the chopper's crew before the radio cut out.</p><p>Evans and Machiavelli looked at each other for a moment, then went back to work. This wasn't the first time they'd heard men die, and certainly wouldn't be the last.</p><p>"<i>At least it was quick."</i> Evans thought <i>"Better than a 121." </i></p><p></p><p>The spires of St Hakabure loomed against the predawn sky in a manner that some would call ominous and threating, but others, like Naota, would call powerful and strong. The church had always been a sign of comfort to Naota from a young age, it's Gothic architecture and stained glass windows representing in his mind the power and glory that was Him.</p><p>So, standing there before the gates and looking up at the spires, Naota still found himself comforted by them, and took that as an encouraging sign. Lifting his chin up, Naota stepped forward and pushed the gates open.</p><p>The instant he crossed over onto the sanctified grounds of the church he instantly felt a headache flare to life right behind his eyes. Grimacing at the pain, Naota rubbed his eyes and kept walking forward. The closer he got to the church, the stronger it got.</p><p>By the time he'd reached the doors to the church his head was throbbing and he could barely see, but Naota kept on. When he laid his hand on the door handle his flesh sizzled and burned at the touch. Tears sprung up at the corners of his eyes and he whimpered in pain, but he fought the pain and turned the knob.</p><p>With a clunk and a slight groan, the door swung open and the dimly lit interior revealed itself before him. It had been over a year since he had last visited the church, but it hadn't changed a bit. Taking a deep breath, Naota took in all of the old familiar scents of the church, along a few new ones he hadn't noticed before- like incense and crackers, the faint smell of a room full of people.</p><p>Wiping the tears from his eyes Naota stepped across the threshold and into the church, closing the door behind him.</p><p></p><p>As Bre had been watching the events in Reno unfold live on CNN, her stomach had been gradually getting more and more knotted with tension. There were now no new downtown pictures coming in, nor any video feeds, not to mention any cell or Internet capaility, so there was no way for news to come out of the downtown area.</p><p>This was being done voluntarily by the networks and carriers, because apparently the terrorists were using cell phones and wireless enabled devices to communicate with each other, and the government had asked them to shut down in order to foil their ability to communicate and coordinate.</p><p>"I'm sure he's fine." Kamone said, coming in with a cup of green tea.</p><p>"I know." Bre said, taking the cup of tea from Kamone. "I still can't help but worry, you know? He is in the Army."</p><p>"It's a natural reaction." Kamone said, glancing at the TV. "You and every other loved one of every American Service member is worried right now." he added.</p><p>"I just wish he'd call." Bre said, taking a sip of tea.</p><p>"I'm sure he wishes he could too." Kamone said as he sat down.</p><p>"What do you mean by that?" Bre asked, turning her attention from the TV to her father.</p><p>Kamone sighed slightly and looked up at Bre. "Bre, every American base right now is on high alert." he said. "They don't allow personal calls when that happens."</p><p>"Oh, right." Bre said, rubbing her eyes with her free hand. "I forgot that."</p><p>Kamone nodded and took in his daughters appearance, which wasn't good, to say the least. "You gonna be okay?" he asked. "You look tired."</p><p>"I'm exhausted." Bre answered. "But I'm too wound up to sleep."</p><p>Kamone frowned as he thought for a moment. "Well, if you cant sleep, maybe you should at the least turn off the TV and lay down." he said, getting up and pointing at the couch. "At the very least it'll help calm your nerves."</p><p>Bre sighed, blowing a stray lock of hair out of her face as she considered Kamones offer. "Okay." she said, walking towards the couch. "Though I wonder why that one reporter was saying that there were giant robots there?" she asked, referring to the reporter who had gotten cut off when the news had just broke.</p><p>Kamone shrugged as she sat down on the couch. "You'd be surprised at what the mind will see while under the stress of combat." he said.</p><p>Bre looked up at him. "Weirder than what goes on around here?" she asked.</p><p>Kamone nodded. "Yeah." he said. "Take my word on it. You really don;t want to find out for yourself." he added, grabbing the remote and turning the TV off.</p><p>"Okay." Bre said, turning the screen of her laptop so she could see it before laying down on the couch and getting comfortable. 'I hope he calls." she repeated.</p><p>"I know." Kamone said with a nod.</p><p></p><p>"Bless me father, for I have sinned." Naota said, voice strained from the pain as he sat in the confessional.</p><p>There was a moments hesitation before Father Fukida responded, his voice showing a slight amount of surprise at hearing a voice he'd thought he never hear in the confessional ever again.</p><p>"W-what is it you wish to confess, my son?" he asked.</p><p>Naota looked down at his hands, his pain blurred vision making them look somewhat fuzzy and indistinct. "I've did some terrible things, Father." he said. 'Some very terrible things."</p><p>There was another slight pause before the Father responded. "What kind of terrible things?" he asked softly .</p><p>"I've-" Naota hesitated slightly as the desire to bolt out of the confessional and out of the church flared within him, but he fought it and pressed on. "I've killed some people, Father." he said. "And I've maimed another."</p><p>"Tell me what happened, my son." Father Fukida said, keeping his voice soft, concern now creeping in along with worry.</p><p>Naota licked his lips before pressing on with his story. "My wife and I were on a shopping trip in Juuban, and I saw that we were being followed by a group of girls." he began. "They were the Sailor Scouts in disguise.</p><p>So Lia and I led them around for a while, until we got to a point where we could confront them. Normally I would have just given them the slip, but one of them was a miko, and I didn't want her following me back to Nerima, so I was hoping we could knock out the others and warn her off." he recounted.</p><p>"Anyways, we were hiding in ambush, and when they got close to us I saw that one of them- I think she's called Mercury- I saw that she had a little pal top computer. Well, I figured, I could kill two birds with one stone, and hack her computer and warn the miko off." Naota continued.</p><p>"I take it that's not what happened?" Father Fukida asked.</p><p>"No." Naota answered with a shake of his head. "Instead of knocking them both out like I would have normally, I knocked the one with the computer out, grabbed her, and told the miko to follow me while Lia kept her friends busy."</p><p>"Why did you not do it the other way around?" Fukida asked.</p><p>Naota ran what had happened through his mind, and what he had been thinking then before he answered. "I didn't know how powerful she was, and if she was stronger than I had expected, I didn't want her to have backup to complicate things."</p><p>"I see." Fukida said. "Go on."</p><p>Naota sighed as he continued his narrative. "Well, anyways, I took tthe computer one to a shopping mall under construction and tied her up, then waited for the miko to show." he said. "When she showed up I shadow jumped behind her and she threw an ofuda at me.</p><p>When she did that, I ducked, and instinctively swiped at her legs with the weapons that I had at hand, which were my claws on my fingers."</p><p>"Did that kill her?" Fukida asked.</p><p>Naota shook his head, as if Father Fukida could see him through the screen in the confessional. "No. I just took her legs off just above the knees." he said. "I tied off the stumps and bandaged them with the first aid kits they had in the construction office." he added.</p><p>There was a few moments of silence as Fukida analyzed what Naota had said. "I take it that you... did not want this thing to have happened?" he asked.</p><p>"Yes." Naota answered. "I misjudged how she would react. I blew it. Badly."</p><p>"It was an accident." Fukida said. "You treated her wounds after you had harmed her. You had remorse for your actions, and so will not be condemned for them in the eyes of God. Say a Hail Mary and trouble yourself with this no longer." he added.</p><p>"Yes father." Naota said.</p><p>"Now, what of the other things that you have did?" asked Fukida.</p><p>Naota chewed on his lip. "I killed two Scouts." he said. "Two I did not know about."</p><p>"What happened?" Fukida asked.</p><p>"After I had treated the mikos wounds, I went up to the roof to reconnoiter the area before I headed back to Lia." he said. "When I shadow jumped up there, they were waiting for me.</p><p>As soon as I stepped out of the shadows, they attacked. There were three of them. One stood back and threw attacks at me while the other two attacked me directly. My training kicked in and I shot the two coming at me in the head, and wounded the one throwing attacks at me."</p><p>"So they attacked you as soon as you appeared?" Fukida asked. "They did not give any warning?" he asked.</p><p>"No, Father." Naota answered.</p><p>"And you have no doubt that they were trying to kill you?" Father Fukida asked.</p><p>Naota remembered the beach ball sized black orb that Pluto had thrown at him, and how it had smashed a square meter of the rooftop where he had been standing.</p><p>"Yes." he said.</p><p>"And if you had know they were there you would not have confronted them?" Fukida asked. "You would have ran away?"</p><p>"Yes." Naota said. "Gladly."</p><p>There was a long pause as Fukida thought over what Naota had said, then he spoke.</p><p>"God is very specific on murder, the wanton taking of life." he began. "But, there is a difference between outright murder and self defense. What you did was defend yourself against the aggression of the Scouts, who followed you and ambushed you.</p><p>If anyone was guilty of sin in this affair, it is them. They raised their hands in anger against you, and tried to bring harm upon you. You did nothing to warrant their actions, save crossing their paths. The only thing you are guilty of is defending yourself.</p><p>So go in peace, my son, and trouble yourself with this no more, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen."</p><p>"Amen." Naota said, crossing himself.</p><p>Getting up, he stepped out of the confessional, and spying the votive candles, headed towards them. Lighting three, he said a quick prayer for the Scouts he had battled, crossed himself and was about to go out the door when a voice he hadn't heard in almost two years spoke behind.</p><p>"Took it long enough to get through that thick skull of yours."</p><p>Whirling around, Naota saw the cat that had caused his transformation into a yokai sitting next to the nearest pew.</p><p>"You." he said flatly. "What are you doing in here? For that matter, <i>how</i> are you able to be in here?" he asked.</p><p>The cat flicked an ear and looked up at him. "The reason why I'm able to be in here is the same reason why you're able to." he said. "We're both His children, after all."</p><p>Naota arched an eyebrow at the feline. "You're an angel?" he asked, voice deadpan. "You expect me to belive that?"</p><p>The cat, for his part, looked nonplussed. "Hey, we're not always a human with white wings and a halo." he said. "We have to adapt to fit the situation."</p><p>"Uh huh." Naota said. "So why are you here?" he asked, deciding to cut to the chase.</p><p>"I'm just checking up on you." the cat answered. "Making sure that you were doing okay."</p><p>"I'm fine, thanks for asking." Naota said. "despite the- waitaminute." he continued, stopping suddenly when something occurred to him. "My headaches gone."</p><p>The cat chuckled softly. "It's amazing what faith can do, cant it?" he asked.</p><p>Naota gave the cat a look. "What do you mean, faith?" he asked. "I had faith in God, even after I was turned-"</p><p>"I was referring to faith in <i>yourself.</i>" the cat interrupted. "You wanted to be able to keep up with Lia- who is looking lovely, by the way- and to be able to free yourself from the demands of the School, but you wanted Gods help to do so, when you had the means to do it yourself all along."</p><p>"What?" Naota asked, confused by the cats answer.</p><p>"Allow to explain." the cat said. "We are all Gods children, right?" he asked.</p><p>Naota nodded. "Yeah." he said.</p><p>"Well, we all have free will. As much as it pains Him, he cannot force us to do anything. We have to choose to do the right thing." the feline continued. "I know it seems wrong, but its what he has to do."</p><p>Naota blinked a couple of times as he digested what the cat had said. "So what your saying is that he doesn't interfere because it would be worse if he did."</p><p>The cat nodded. "Exactly." he said. "Whats worse? Letting someone choose the right path, or forcing them onto it irregardless of what they think?"</p><p>Naota nodded. "I can see His point." he said. "From being a member of the Hagakure." he added. "Though I have one question though."</p><p>"Yes?" the cat asked, tilting its head to one side.</p><p>"Why turn give me this?" Naota asked, pointing at his stripes.</p><p>"Oh." the cat said. "That. That's easy. When I showed up I was gonna give you a bit of friendly advice, you know, just gonna point out the obvious." he added, licking at a paw "But because yo decided to be rude and pull a gun on me, I decided that I'd have to hit you upside the head with a two by four, metaphorically speaking.</p><p>I knew that you'd first think you'd forsaken, and come to the church. I just didn't think that it'd take almost <i>two years</i>."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said sheepishly. "Sorry about that."</p><p>"It's okay." the cat said. "It was my mistake, not yours."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said. "By the way, is there any chance you could change me back?" he asked.</p><p>The cat reluctantly shook his head. "No." he said. "The big man thinks that you can do some good as a yokai. Sorry."</p><p>Naota shrugged. "It's okay." he said. "It could be a lot worse."</p><p>"That's the spirit." the cat. "Now if you'll excuse me, theres a nice little hole in the wall diner that serves a killer tuna special, and I agreed to meet a colleague there. Later." he added, and with a sweep of his tail he was gone.</p><p>Naota looked at the spot where the cat had been for several moments, then looked upwards. "Thanks." he said, and then walked to the doors and stepped through them into the morning sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Evans groaned and leaned back in his chair while he rubbed his eyes. The shooting had stopped hours ago, but his (and everyone else's) work was far from done. While the ground units had established a cordon around the OA (operations area) and had been reinforced by a combination of national Guardsmen and Air Force personnel pulled in from Tonapah, Ellis, Area 51, and Black Mesa, he and the rest of Gatekeeper had set to work.</p><p>They'd fanned out across the Net, hacking into servers, planting fake photos, rumors, innuendos, half truths and even a couple of outright lies to keep the lunatic fringe chasing it's tail and keeping itself busy for years.</p><p>They'd also started to build a credible back story to the event, to keep the news orginazations busy and convince the majority of the American public that what had happened was a bunch of lunatics had ran amok and caused massive property damage instead of a bunch of massive shape changing robots brawling in the streets.</p><p>And that didn't even begin to cover what he'd had to do to extract his assets from the location without the various agencies converging on the situation noticing them. He'd had to pull some strings and call in a favor from the agent nicknamed "the G Man" to get them out, and whenever he'd had to deal with that purple suited bureaucrat, it gave him a headache-</p><p>"Sargent Major?" a voice asked as a shadow fell across him.</p><p>Evans looked up and saw Captain Mendez standing over him. "Yes, sir?" he asked, blinking owlishly.</p><p>"When was the last time you slept, Sargent?" asked the Captain.</p><p>"Uhhh..." was Evans response as he looked at the clock and did some mental arithmatic. "A really long fucking time ago, sir." he said.</p><p>"I thought so." Mendez said. "Go get some sleep, Sargent. Thats an order."</p><p>"Yes, sir." Evans said, and locked down his computer.</p><p>He was halfway to the door when he realized just how long he'd been on this operation, and he remembered a mental note that he had made when they had left japan. "Uh, Captain?" he asked his CO.</p><p>Mendez turned around from where he was conversing with Colonel O'Neil and General Hammond. "Yes Sargent?" he asked.</p><p>"May I call my girlfriend?" he asked. "I had to leave kind of suddenly, and I'm sure she's worried sick right now."</p><p>Mendez looked at Hammond, who gave his consent with a nod of his head. "Go right ahead, Sargent Major." the General said. "If you want some privacy, I'm sure the Colonel would be glad to oblige you the use of his office."</p><p>Colonel O'Neil blinked, momentarily surprised at being put in the spotlight. "Ah, I wouldn't mind at all, sir." he said to the General. "I can tell you how to get there..." he added.</p><p>Oh, I know where it is, Colonel. Thank you, General, Captain." Evans said, giving the assembled officers a salute.</p><p>"You're welcome, Sargent Major." Hammond said, noting how Colonel O'Neil had twitched when Evans had said that he knew where his office was. "You should just pay the man, Colonel." Hammond said as soon as Evans was out of earshot. "It's only fifty bucks."</p><p>"It's not about that bet, sir." O'Neil responded.</p><p>"Then what is it about?" Hammond asked. "You've been butting heads with him the whole time he's been here."</p><p>"Well, it's classified sir." O'Neil said.</p><p>General Hammond nodded. "And I take it I don't have the proper clearance?" he asked, looking in Mendez's direction.</p><p>"Yes, sir." Mendez said. "Sorry General, but it's codeword classified, and not relevant to the situation."</p><p>"I understand." Hammond said. "Now back to the matter at hand..."</p><p></p><p>Evans found O'Neil'f office door ajar when he got there and stepped inside. Closing the door behind him, he picked up the phone and dialed a number, and waited for an answer.</p><p>"Hello. State your name please." the voice on the other end said, the request being for a password and not for an identity.</p><p>"Francis Wayland Thurston." Evans said, answering the first part of the ID process.</p><p>"State your purpose please." the voice said, confirming that he had passed the first layer.</p><p>"I have a message from Henry Anthony Wilcox." Evans said.</p><p>"State message please." the voice asked.</p><p>"He said, quote, 'It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden -girdled Babylon.'"</p><p>"One moment." the voice said, and there was series of clicks followed by a beep. "Connection secure." the voice added. "How can we assist you?"</p><p>"I need to call my girlfriend from the office." Evans said, and rattled off Bre's number.</p><p>"One moment." the voice said.</p><p>There was another series of clicks, followed by a dial tone. It rang a couple of times before it got picked up.</p><p>"Hello?" the tired voice of Bre said on the other end.</p><p>"Hey." Evans said. "It's me."</p><p>There was silence for the briefest of moments. "WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?" Bre yelled. "AND WHY HAVEN"T YOU CALLED?"</p><p>Evans winced at the volume, and reminded himself that she had a right to be angry. "I'm on Okinawa. That's about all I can tell you though without breaking OPSEC." he said.</p><p>"Okay." Bre said in a calmer voice. "So why haven't you called me?" she asked.</p><p>"I'm a Sargent Major, Bre." Evans said. "I'm the one who gets to make sure that everything gets done. This is the first time I've had a break in the last couple of days."</p><p>"Alright." Bre said. "Sorry for yelling at you, I've just been worried sick with whats been going on."</p><p>Evans nodded. "Yeah, I don;t blame you." he said. "What, with whats been going on in Reno and all."</p><p>"Yeah, part of me kept thinking that you were there on the front lines." Bre said.</p><p>"<i>Well, I wasn't on the front lines, but I was part of it." </i> Evans thought. "Nah, I was just on Okinawa, keeping track of a few hundred bored enlisted men." he said.</p><p>"So nothings happened there?" she asked.</p><p>"Nope." Evans said. "The most exiting thing to happen here was I got to see a Marine Staff Sargent chew a Lance Corporal out for having dirty magazines and Machiavelli won a hacky sack contest."</p><p>"Evans, I found that stack of Playboys you have." Bre said in a deadpan voice.</p><p>"I was referring to the ones for his rifle." Evans added.</p><p>"Oh." was Bres response. "Anyways, speaking of dirty magazines, when I found them your mom called.</p><p>"<i>Oh no." </i>thought Evans. "Oh, really." he said. "Hows she doing?" he asked.</p><p>"She's worried sick about you." Bre answered. "She told me to tell you to call her as soon as you can."</p><p>"I'll get right on that." Evans said. "Uh look, theres a line of guys behind me, so I gotta go. I think I should be back sometime in the next couple of days,so..."</p><p>"Okay." Bre said. "Call me the next time you have a chance." she added.</p><p>"I will. " Evans said.</p><p>"And call your mom." Bre added.</p><p>"I will." Evans replied. "Talk to you later." he said before hanging up.</p><p>"Crap!" he said, smacking his forehead with the heel of his hand. "I haven't called in four years, Mom's gonna kill me..."</p><p></p><p>.</p><p>End.</p><p>Authors Note: And so I finally manage to bring to a close one of the major sub plots of First Steps. (And manage to open up a new one. Oy vey...)</p><p>A word on the confessional scene: One, to my Catholic readers, if it seems off to you how it went, I'm a Latter Day Saint, and my only source for that is my mom, who converted from being a Catholic in the Seventies. My source's info is a little rusty so hence any incongruities.</p><p>Second, the dialog between Naota and his priest and between him and the cat is the reason why it took me so long to finish this, even though at over six thousand words it's shorter than my usual chapters.</p><p>Morality and Go are very weighty subjects, and I had to put a lot of thought into what I was going to have the characters say to each other. What the cat said is my personal opinion on those matters. We are God's children, and he is a moral God, so he cannot just make us do things when we have free will and the option of choice.</p><p>And on a lighter note, I like pie.</p>
