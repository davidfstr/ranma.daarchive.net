</div><p>Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Five.</p><p>Chapter 8.</p><p>Lia lay very still  and tried not to think. Thinking hurt. Her head was pounding, her  eyes were glued shut, her tounge needed shaved, her stomach was doing  flip -flops, and her mouth tasted like a sewer.</p><p>Lia, was, in short,  hung over. Badly.</p><p>The sound of  footsteps in the hall made Lia grimace in  pain and for once wish she didn't have such sensitive hearing.  Eventually the footsteps stopped to which Lia sighed in relief and  immediately regretted it.</p><p>When the latch on  her door popped open it was like Naota had fired his pistol. Lia  grimaced again as the footsteps started again, this time louder and  coming into her room.</p><p>They stopped when  they were right next to her. Cracking open one eye Lia was given a  very blurry view of something green and brown right in front of her.</p><p>"<i>green?"</i>  Lia thought. Blinking a couple of times it resolved into an old green  tang and wavy dark brown and Lia realized why it was there: Matoko  was wearing it. <i>"Matoko." </i>she  thought as she remembered.</p><p>After helping heave  last night they had gone back to her room  and changed into something a little more comfortable than evening  wear. And since her nightgown was such a long ways away, Matoko had  simply grabbed one of Lias sleep shirts.</p><p>That mystery solved  Lia <i>very </i>carefully tilted her head back and looked up to see  Bre standing over her and Matoko and looking entirelytoo cheerful, to which Lia gave her a look that said 'if you're  not here to put me out of my misery then go away and let me die in  peace'.</p><p>"Rise and shine."  Bre whispered, which was still too loud for Lia. "You've got to get  married in a couple of hours." she added.</p><p>Giving a slight  sigh Lia rolled away from Matoko and , careful not to upset her  stomach, sat up. The movement brought Matoko around too, who opened  her eyes to get an up -close view of Bres feet. Blinking a couple of  times she rolled over and winced at the fresh pain in her head.</p><p>Sitting up herself  Matoko rubbed her forehead.</p><p>"What did I  drink...?" she mewed.</p><p>"I told you that  that you'd regret that Cuervo." Bre  answered, to which Matoko groaned. "And Akane said that when you  two are ready get downstairs and she'll make some hangover cures for  you."</p><p>Lia groaned in  reply while Matoko started to nod, then stopped. Her eyes bugged out  as she clamped a hand over her mouth, lunged for the trash can by  Lias desk and retched.</p><p>Bre grimaced and  hurried over to Matoko. "Here, let me hold your hair." she said.  As Matoko went into the dry heaves Bre looked at Lia, who was getting  a little green around the gills. "Think you can make it to the  bathroom?" Bre asked.</p><p>Lia nodded once as  Matoko finished up. "How about you?" she asked. "Can you make  it?"</p><p>Getting a nod Bre  helped Matoko to her feet as rolled onto hers and ran to the bathroom  as fast as she could. Behind her came Matoko and Bre.</p><p>Bre left them in  the bathroom and headed downstairs, where the wounded were gathered  in various stages of being hung -over. Stepping around Nabiki -who  looked like she had caught the T- Virus- Bre went to  the kitchen and poked her head in.</p><p>Inside the kitchen  Kasumi was washing out the blender in the sink while Akane sipped her  hangover cure(1). She looked up when Bre stuck her head in.</p><p>"The bride will  be down in a minute." Bre said. "right now Matokos holding her  hair."</p><p>Akane nodded  gently, mindful of her headache. "Kay." she said in a low voice.  "I'll get started on their Hangover Tonics(2)."</p><p>Bre chuckled as she  stepped into the kitchen. "Man, that was some party last night."  she said.</p><p>Akane laughed as  she walked over to the freezer. "I know." she said. "I didn't  know Matoko could hold her liquor like that."</p><p>Bre shrugged as she  found a place to stand by the phone. "She's a big girl, Akane."  she said. "Yeah." Akane said as she took out a tub of ice cream.  Shutting the freezer she took a bottle of seltzer out of the fridge  and shut the door. "But she has no meat on her." she added.</p><p>"I noticed that  too." Kasumi interjected as she handed the clean blender to Akane.  "Has she been eating?"</p><p>Taking the blender  Akane nodded. "Yes, she has." she said. "As much as Christian  and Mamimi. But it doesn't stick." Akane  added as she pried the lid off the ice cream. "Honestly, I think  she could clean out a buffet and <i>lose </i>weight."</p><p>Bre snorted as she  leaned against the wall. "I wish I had that problem." she said.</p><p>"There is a  solution for that." Akane said as she glanced over her shoulder.  "All you have to do is practice the Anything Goes chi techniques  for the next twenty years and you'll be set." she said as she dug a  scoop out of the drawer.</p><p>"No thanks."  Bre said as she shook her head.</p><p>Akane shrugged as  she scooped out some ice cream an dumped it  into the blender. "Your loss." she said.</p><p>After she had put  the ice cream into the blender Akane poured in some seltzer, then  went back to the fridge for some milk. After adding that she gritted  her teeth against the pain and pressed 'frappes.  She let it run for about forty -five seconds, then turned it off.  Massaging her forehead to clear the pain Akane took two large glasses  from the cupboard and set them on the counter.  Hearing the slow 'thump-thump' of feet on the stairs Akane  pried the lid off the blender.</p><p>"Sounds  like the girls are done with the bathroom." said Akane as  she poured the milkshakes. "Could you take these out to them?"  she asked, which got a nod from Bre.</p><p>Sticking a  straw in each of them, Akane handed the milkshakes to Bre who then  took them into the main room where Lia and Matoko were seated at the  table.</p><p>"Here you go girls." Bre said as  she set the shakes in front of them. "Two hangover  cures."</p><p>Lia blinked as she looked at the  milkshake i n front of her, then turned her gaze at Bre. "How come  you're not hung over?" she asked as Matoko sipped hers.</p><p>"Sanos are immune to hangovers."  Bre answered with a smile. "Something I think the boys are gonna  find out soon."</p><p></p><p>Sitting up Naota stretched and looked  around the room he was sleeping in. It was quite clearly the Tofu  family living room, and sprawled around him were several passed out  men and one woman. Hearing movement in the kitchen Naota got up and  found Evans in there with Ono making coffee.</p><p>"You're up." Evans rasped when  Naota came in.</p><p>Naota nodded as he  rubbed the back of his neck. "Yeah." he answered. "And you look  like hell." he added as he looked over Evans.</p><p>"Yeah, well, some  of us aren't like Sanos and are immune to hangovers." Evans  replied, to which Naota snorted in amusement.</p><p>"Thats not my  problem." Naota responded. "And speaking of problems, where's Dad  and Grandpa?"</p><p>"They left an  hour ago." Ono said as he pulled some food from the fridge. "Right  before Evans woke up."</p><p>Naota nodded as he  looked back into the living room and the passed out partygoers  in there. "Oh. Did they say where they were going?" he asked.</p><p>Closing the fridge  door with his foot Ono maneuvered the  containers of food over to the counter. "To Lias house." he said.  "Something about setting up security for the wedding."</p><p>"Oh, thats right,  Uncle Hideki an' the rest of the family got  in last night." Naota said with a shake of his head.</p><p>Evans gave Naota an  odd look. "Do you know just how <i>odd </i>that sounds?" he  asked.</p><p>Naota nodded.  "Yeah." he answered. "But this <i>is </i>Nerima." added  Naota. "Having ninjas run security for your wedding is a  necessity."</p><p>Evans winced at  that. "The scary part is that you're right." he said as the  coffee finished perking.</p><p>"Tell me about  it." Naota answered. "By the way, how are we gonna get the stiffs  in there to house for the wedding?" he asked.</p><p>"Well..."  Evans said as he poured himself some coffee. "As soon as I have  some coffee I'm gonna give them a sample of what basic was like."</p><p>"Ah." Naota  said with a nod. "That should be fun." he added. "But be sure  to leave some coffee for Kenji. He'll need it."</p><p>"Oh, he slow  getting up in the morning?" Evans asked over his cup.</p><p>Naota snorted in  amusement. "A zombie would have nothing on him." he responded as  Ono chuckled.</p><p>"Then he sounds  like 'Biki(3) and Chisu." he said as he  finished his breakfast. "I assume he takes his coffee black?"  asked Ono.</p><p>Naota shook his  head. "Nah. Normally he drinks tea." he said. "But his tea can  eat through most plastics."</p><p>Evans and Ono  winced at that statement. "Sounds like the coffee at the office."  Evans said before he drained his cup. "And now, it's time to go  deliver a wake up call." he said as he cracked his knuckles.</p><p>Striding into the  living room Evans cleared his throat and set to work.</p><p>"WAKE UP!" he  bellowed. "WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR BEAUTY SLEEP LADIES!"</p><p>The effect was  instantaneous. Immediately all the bodies came to life, groaning and  rolling over in an effort to escape the assault on their eardrums.  Unfortunately, that proved to be an  exercise in futility, for Evans was not to be deterred.</p><p>Rolling over with a  groan Hideo looked up at Evans. "Do you mind? Some of us are trying  to sleep." he rasped.</p><p>Leaning over Hideo  Evans glowered down at Hideo. "IF I WANTED YOUR OPINON I'D ASK FOR  IT MAGGOT! NOW GET ON YOUR FEET! MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!' bellowed Evans.</p><p>That had the  desired effect: Hideo was instantly on his feet and at attention. In  short order Evans had everyone else up, on their feet, and outside  the house. Shoving everyone into a rough formation Evans was far from  happy with how it looked, but it'd do.</p><p>"ALRIGHT MAGGOTS!  LISTEN UP!" he bellowed. "WE'RE HEADING TO THE SAOTOME HOUSE, AND  IF I HEAR ANY BITCHING OR WHINING WERE DOING DOUBLE TIME AND EVERYONE  GIVES ME FIFTY WHEN WE GET THERE! IS THAT CLEAR!" Evans yelled.  Getting a chorus of groans he scowled. "I  CANT HEAR YOU!"</p><p>"Sir, yes sir."  came the weak reply.</p><p>"THAT'S BETTER!"  Evans bellowed in reply. "NOW LETS GO! FORWARD, MARCH!"</p><p>With that, the  motley group trudged forwards.</p><p></p><p>Once they were done  with her hangover cure Lia was hustled off by Nodoka to tent that had  been set up alongside the house so she could begin  getting into her wedding kimono. Matoko came along as well to help  Lia as well.</p><p>That left Nabiki at  the table, her hangover making her even more sluggish than normal.  She had finished her tonic and was now working her way through her  third cup of coffee.</p><p>Nabiki was sitting  with her eyes closed, letting the caffeine  work its way into her system when Bre came in.</p><p>"I'm gonna be  helping out in the dojo. You need anything?" asked Bre. Getting a  shake of the head from Nabiki Bre nodded. "Okay. Akane and Kasumi  are in the kitchen if you need anything." she said as she left.</p><p>Cracking open her  eyes Nabiki watched as Bre left, then sighed and laid her head on the  table. The sounds of the curtain being moved and heavy footsteps told  her that Akane had come in.</p><p>"Hey 'Kane."  Nabiki said, her voice muffled.</p><p>"Hey 'Biki."  Akane answered as he sat down. "You okay?"</p><p>Nabiki sniffled and  lifted her head. "No." she answered as tears slid down her  cheeks, streaking the mascara she hadn't  bothered to remove last night. "I'm not."</p><p>Clearly surprised  to see Nabiki crying, Akane leaned forwards towards his sister.  "Whats wrong?" he asked.</p><p>Nabiki chewed on  her lower lip for a second, then took a slug of coffee before she  responded. "Bre." she answered. Getting an odd look from Akane  Nabiki continued. "She sounds exactly like her mother."</p><p>"You knew her  mother?" Akane asked. "I didn't know that. Why didn't you say  anything?"</p><p>Nabiki sniffled  again and wiped her nose with the sleeve of her bathrobe. "Two  reasons." she said. "One, it never seemed to be the right time,  and two,-" Nabiki swallowed again before continuing. "And two it  brings up a lot of painful memories for me. Haruko was my best  friend."</p><p>Akane sipped his  hangover cure as he thought about what his sister had said. "How  come we never met her?" he asked, the 'we' referring to the family.</p><p>Nabiki laughed  mirthlessly. "You know what I was like when we were kids." she  said. "I was the Ice Queen, remember? I had an image to maintain at  home."</p><p>"Ah." Akane  said with a nod. "But I take it theres more, isn't it?" he asked,  to which Nabiki nodded.</p><p>"Kamone."  Nabiki said. "He was never intimidated by me. And that bugged the  hell out of me." she continued. "So I tried to dig up dirt on  him. Second biggest mistake of my life."</p><p>"Okay." Akane  said with a nod.</p><p>"I get a note one  day in class. It's from him, asking to meet him after school. Alone."  Nabiki said, staring down at the empty coffee cup in her hands. "I  show up, and he hands me an envelope. In it were photos of our  family. Asleep, at night. He told me that if I left him alone, he'd  leave me alone."</p><p>"at...<i>night</i>?"  Akane asked, a bit of a tremor in her voice.</p><p>Nabiki nodded as  she continued. "And everything was fine, till a couple of months  later he and Haruko met." she said. "And we left each other  alone, and everything was fine. He didn't try to come between us or  anything, and I didn't tell Haruko what I felt." Nabiki continued  as she pushed the mug away as she stretched. "Which was that he was  dangerous, and she might get hurt. Turns out I was right, but it  wouldn't be because of him."</p><p>Akane leaned on the  table and looked at his sister. "So what happened?" he asked.</p><p>Nabiki buried her  face in her hands as she spoke. "Before I tell you that, you've got  to understand something. When I said we were best friends, I wasn't  kidding. I was there when Bre and Naota were born. She was there when  Chisu was born- in fact it was her that kept me from strangling  Tatewaki when I was in labor." she said with a laugh, then she  sobered. "I consoled her when Bre was put up for adoption, and  shared her joy when she found out she was pregnant with Naota. Thats  how we were, okay?"</p><p>Akane nodded as his  sister continued. "You and Ranma were gone when she died. There had  been a series of assaults on housewives a couple of wards over, and,  and," Nabiki swallowed before she said the next part. "And Kamone  had taken Naota to the zoo on his fifth birthday. And their apartment  got hit." she said quietly. "Haruko fought back, and the bastard  killed her. He had to choose that day to change areas."</p><p>They sat in silence  for a couple of moments before Akane finally spoke. "So thats what  happened." she said. "and why you've seemed distant."</p><p>"Uh-huh."  Nabiki answered. "And ever since I met Bre I keep getting reminded  of what happened."</p><p>Akane looked down  at his glass as he considered what to say next. Finally he looked up  at his sister. "So, what are you going to do?"he asked.</p><p>Nabiki sighed and  shrugged. "Well, I'm going to tell Bre and Naota what I told you  after the wedding." she said as she looked at her hands again. "And  I'm going to apologize to Kamone. I said  some things to him that I shouldn't have when Haruko died." Nabiki  added. "And I have something that belongs  to Bre and Naota too."</p><p>"What is it?"  asked Akane.</p><p>Nabikis mouth  quirked into a smile. "All of Harukos  work." she said. "I was archiving it onto disk when she died. I  made a copy for myself, and Bre and Naota are getting copies as well,  and I'm gonna give the originals to Kamone." added Nabiki as she  got up. "But, for now, I'm going to get off my rear and go help get  my niece married."</p><p>"Okay." Akane  said as she stood up. "And I'm heading back into the kitchen.  I think the guys are here and they're going to need lots and lots of  tonic."</p><p></p><p>"So, what do you  think?"</p><p>"I look  ridiculous."</p><p>Naota was standing  in Akanes sewing room dressed in his wedding kimono. It was navy  blue, made out of the best silk they could get and had tigers  embroidered on it in dark silver. All in  all, it was a very handsome and elegant garment to be married in.</p><p>"Nonsense."  Dokuhotei said as he admired his grandson. "You dignified and  noble, like a great samurai."</p><p>Naota scowled at  his grandfathers reflection in the full length mirror he was standing  in front of. "Grandpa, we're Hagakure. We <i>killed </i>samurai,  not looked like them." he said as he  fanned himself. "And could you get a fan?  I'm roasting here."</p><p>His kimono was also  exactly the wrong thing to be wearing in the middle of a Tokyo  summer, a fact not lost on Dokuhotei who was also dressed in his own  formal kimono.</p><p>"I'll go see what  I can scrounge up." he said as he walked to the door. "At the  least I'll see if Kasumi has any of that lemonade left."</p><p>Naota nodded his  thanks as his grandfather left. Standing there roasting in his kimono  Naota wondered how soon it was going to be before the wedding proper  started, and if he would have died of heat exhaustion by then.</p><p>His right ear  twitched when he head footsteps in the hall, his demonic hearing and  years of training in the Hagakure school telling him that it was Bre  approaching.</p><p>"Knock knock."  Bre said as she knocked on the door frame.</p><p>"Hey Bre."  Naota said with a wave.</p><p>"Hey kitten."  Bre said as she stepped in. "Nervous?"</p><p>Naota laughed  nervously as he looked around the room. "You have no idea." he  said. "I've was calmer when I faced down the school." Naota said  as he looked up at his sister. "You know, this is just a formality,  cause Lia and I are mated. So why am I so nervous?"</p><p>Bre chuckled as she  began to dig around in the pockets of her jeans. "Probably because  it just hit home that you're going to be spending the rest of your  life with this person?" she said as she found what she was looking  for. "On that thought, Kamone planned ahead and told me to give you  this." Bre said as she pulled a hip flask from her pocket and  handed it to Naota.</p><p>Naota sighed in  relief as he took the flask from his sister. "Thank god, I could  use a belt right now." he said as he unscrewed the cap. After  taking a healthy swig he put the cap back on and tucked it into his  kimono. "You know, every now and then that idiot actually does  something right."</p><p>"So you're still  mad at him." Bre said as she crossed her arms.</p><p>"No I'm not."  Naota said with a shake of his head. "I'm punting him into the  walls anymore, am I?" he added as Bre gave him a sour look. "Look,  he's here in the wedding, okay?'</p><p>Bre sighed as she  looked at her brother. "So when are you going to start talking to  him?" she asked.</p><p>"As soon as I  confirm some recessive family traits with  Uncle Hideki." Naota answered as he pulled the flask out again.</p><p>"What family  traits?" Bre asked as she put her hands on her hips. "What are  you talking about?"</p><p>The flask paused  halfway at his lips as Naota responded. "You haven't met Uncle  Hideki?" he asked.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Naota nodded as he  took a quick belt from the flask. "So you wouldn't know." he said  as he put the flask back on.</p><p>"Know what  Naota?" Bre asked as she stamped her foot in irritation.</p><p>Naota shrugged as  he put the flask away again. "Uncle Hideki is our fathers twin  brother." he said. "Grandpa is a twin, back home in the  mountains(4) we have at least six cousins that are twins. It's a  family trait.</p><p>Bre blanched  as she absorbed this information. "You mean..." she began.</p><p>Naota shrugged. "We  could have twin siblings out there." he said. "But Grandpa said  that it was recessive with Dad and Uncle Hideki. They're identical  twins, so since his kids aren't..."</p><p>Bre blinked.  "Waitaminute. If you already know, why  verify?" she asked.</p><p>Naota shrugged.  "Paranoia, that and we have a cousin who I owe a few dozen noogies  to." he answered as he cracked his knuckles. "Besides, his wifes  an incredible cook and I want to get her, Matoko, and Kasumi together  in the kitchen."</p><p>Bre rolled her eyes  as she looked at her brother. "Do you always have an ulterior  motive for everything?" she asked.</p><p>"Please." Naota  said with a wave of his hand. "I have at least two, with back up  motives as well not to mention a plan B, C, and D."</p><p>"What ever."  Bre said as she shook her head. "I'm gonna go get changed." she  said.</p><p>"Kay."Naota  said with a nod. "And tell Grandpa to hurry up with that lemonade.  I'm roasting here." he said</p><p>"I will." Bre  said as she left.</p><p>Walking back down  the hall Bre was completely unprepared for the sight that greeted  her: the kitsune Asako Kawashima having tea with Chris- chan and  Mamimi in matching kimonos, with Asakos kimono looking like it  belonged in a Edo period courtesans  wardrobe.</p><p>Asako looked up  when Bre came in and gave her a smile that promised lots of mischief.</p><p>"Hello Bre."  she said. "I would have gotten here earlier, but I was needed at  the shop."</p><p>Bre blinked twice,  then shook her head. "You got invited to the wedding?" she asked.</p><p>Asakos smile grew  into a huge grin as she nodded. "Uh -huh. Kamone needed a date."  she answered.</p><p>Bre nodded. "Ohhh  -kay. Naota is gonna kill him for that, but thats nothing new." she  said as she eyed Asakos kimono. "Nice kimono."</p><p>"This old thing?"  asked Asako as she looked down at herself. "I've had it for  centuries." she said. "And that reminds me."</p><p>Bre watched as  Asako snapped her fingers and she was bathed in foxfire for a moment.  When it cleared her hair was red, her eyes were fox -looking, and she  now had six large fox tails attached to her rear. Looking up at Bre  Asako sighed in relief.</p><p>"ahhh...  much better." Asako said.</p><p>Bre blinked as she  saw that Asako had what looked like whisker markings on her face.  "Naota and Lia weren't kidding about you  being a fox." she said.</p><p>"Nope." Asako  answered as her grin returned. Swishing her tails she continued. "I'm  100 kitsune." she said as she pointed at Christian. "Though  Christian here would make a decent fox too. All he needs is some  tails."</p><p>Bres eyes bugged  out as Asako said that and she turned to head up the stairs. "Ah,  yeah. I gotta go change. Bye." she said before fleeing.</p><p>Asako watched Bre  flee before turning back to Chris -chan and  Mamimi. "What a thoroughly odd girl."  she said.</p><p>"I think it's  cause she's an American." Christian said as she sipped her (cold)  tea. "Her, Evans, my sister. They're all kinda weird like that."</p><p>"Oh well."  Asako said as she refilled her tea. "Now, about the finer points of  mischief."</p><p></p><p>Inside the kitchen  Lia sat on a stool, trying not to chew on her lip and thus smudge her  lipstick. She was dressed in the traditional  all-white wedding kimono, her hair was set into the bunkin  -takashimada, and she the slightest bit of  makeup on it. Grandma Nodoka had insisted on the full workup, but a  hissing fit from Lia had put that to rest.</p><p>With Lia in the  kitchen were Matoko and Akane. Her sister was dressed in a indigo  kimono with gold phoenixes while Akane was in cursed form wearing a  dark red kimono with dragons picked out in black. They were both  standing, lost in their own thoughts while they waited with her.</p><p>Unable to stand it  anymore Lia looked up at her mother.</p><p>"Mom, what was  your wedding like?" she asked.</p><p>"mm?" Akane  grunted as he was snapped out of his thoughts by Lias question. "My  wedding?" he asked. "It wasn't a wedding so much as a ceremony  with a justice of the peace at the Blackhawk  County Courthouse." he added.</p><p>"Oh." Lia said  as she looked down at her hands.</p><p>Seeing the way his  daughters tail twitched from side to side Akane could tell that Lia  was nervous- understandable, given that  she was going to get married in a few minutes.</p><p>"You okay?" he  asked. "Can I get you something?"</p><p>Lia shook her head  slightly as she looked up at her mother. "No, thanks." she said.  Taking a deep breath she continued. "Did you feel like you wanted  to throw up when you got married?" Lia asked.</p><p>Akanes mouth  quirked into a smile as he recalled the memory. "Once or twice."  he said. "Ranma <i>did </i>throw up two or three times, but that's  cause he was carrying you, so..." Akane added with a shrug.</p><p>"Oh. Well thats  not why my stomachs upset." Lia said as she looked around the  kitchen. "I think it's the hangover and adrenaline."  she said. "But that bag of catnip Bre tossed into the tent helped."</p><p>"Thank god for  that." Akane said. "Otherwise I don't think we would have never  gotten Christian dressed, even with Matoko and Mamimis help."</p><p>Matoko looked up at  the mention of her name. "Mmm?" she asked. "Is it time?" she  asked.</p><p>Akane looked up at  the clock and nodded. "Just about." he said. "You ready Lia?"  he asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Lia  said as she stood up. "I'm as ready as I'll ever be." she added.</p><p>"Well, lets go."  Akane said as he held the curtain up for Lia. "It's time we got you  married."</p><p>With slow,  deliberate steps, Lia walked out of the kitchen and into the main  room. Turning left she headed down the hall with Akane in front and  Matoko at the rear. Passing by the sewing room Lia could have sworn  she heard Dokuhotei muttering about how Naota hadn't  left anything for him, but then they were  at the door to the dojo.</p><p>Sliding the door  open Akane stepped inside, then over to the right to make way for  her. Inside the dojo was was empty, save for Lama Eno  who was kneeling on the floor as he waited for the bride and groom.  The screens were opened and outside stood all of Lia and Naotas  friends and family, similarly dressed in colorful kimonos as well.</p><p>The only exceptions  were Bre and Evans, Evans being dressed in his Class A's and Bre in a  simple -yet elegant – a -line dress in a medium purple. Her hair  was in a very elaborate set of braids, showing that even when she was  dressed up she was still a punk at heart.</p><p>Beside Bre Evans  stood as a dark green monolith, his ribbons, patches, and rank  insignia adding a splashplash of color.</p><p>Lia walked across  the dojo floor and knelt down next to Lama Eno, and a few moments  later Naota appeared and joined her. This being his cue Lama Eno  stood up and cleared his throat.</p><p>"Today, Saotome  Lia and Sano Naota are happy not just because they can express their  love for each other with friends and family, but also because they  can express their aspirations for the future." he said. Looking  down at the two kneeling at his feet Lama Eno nodded and they both  rose and turned to face him.</p><p>"Naota and Lia,  do you pledge to help each other to help  develop your hearts and minds, cultivating compassion, generosity,  ethics, patience, enthusiasm,  concentration, and wisdom as you age and undergo the various ups and  downs of life and to transform them into the path of love,  compassion, joy, and equanimity?"</p><p>Green eyes met blue  and found the answer to the question in each other.</p><p>"We do." said  Naota and Lia together.</p><p>"Recognizing  that the external conditions in life will  not always be smooth and that internally your own minds and emotions  will sometimes get stuck in negativity, do you pledge to see all  these circumstances as a challenge to help you grow, to open your  hearts, to accept yourselves, and each other; and to generate  compassion for others who are suffering? Do you pledge to avoid  becoming narrow, closed or opinionated, and to help each other to see  various sides of situations?"</p><p>As the Lama spoke  Naota and Lias thoughts went over their past two tumultuous  years together and found their answer.</p><p>"We do." they  said.</p><p>"Understanding  that just as we are a mystery to ourselves,  we are a mystery to each other. Do you pledge to seek to understand  yourselves, each other, and all living things? Do you pledge to  continually examine your own minds and to regard all the mysteries of  life with both curiosity and joy?"</p><p>"We do." Lia  and Naota answered.</p><p>"Do  you pledge to preserve and enrich your affection for each other, and  to share it with all beings? Totake  the loving feelings you have for one another and your vision of each  other's potential and inner beauty as anexample and rather than  spiraling inwards and becoming self absorbed, to radiate this love  outwards to allbeings?"</p><p>"We  do."</p><p>"When  it comes time to part, do you pledge to look back at your time  together with joy-joy that you met and shared what you have-and  acceptance that we cannot hold on to anything forever?"</p><p>In  the audience Soun, Dokuhotei, and Kamone  sighed softly as Naota and Lia spoke.</p><p>"We  do." they said.</p><p>"Do  you pledge to remember the disadvantages of ignorance, anger and  clinging attachment, to apply antidotes when these arise in your  minds, and to remember the kindness of all other beings and your  connection to them? Do you pledge to work for the welfare of others,  with all of your compassion, wisdom and skill?"</p><p>Each  remembered the lessons learned from their childhood and nodded.</p><p>"We  do." they said.</p><p>"Do  you pledge to work to develop the wisdom understanding the relative  functioning nature of things and the wisdom knowing their deeper way  of existence that they are empty of inherent existence? And to  remember the laws of cause and effect?"</p><p>Lia  felt her tail as it swayed softly from side to side, and Naota  smelled the rich tapestry of scents in the room and they both nodded.</p><p>"We  do." they said.</p><p>"Do  you pledge day to day, to be patient with yourselves and others,  knowing that change comes slowly and gradually, and to seek  inspiration from your teachers not to become discouraged?"</p><p>They  both remembered the long hours spent in the  dojo as they nodded.</p><p>"We  do." they said.</p><p>"Do  you pledge to continuously strive to remember your own Buddha nature,  as well as the Buddha nature of all living beings? To maintain the  awareness that all things are temporary, and to remain optimistic  that you can achieve your greatest potential and lasting happiness?"</p><p>The  discoveries that they had each made in the last years came back to  them as the Lama spoke.</p><p>"We  do." they said.</p><p>Lama  Eno nodded and put his hands together as he spoke to them.</p><p>"Then  the ring that you have for each other are a sign of the inward and  spiritual bond which unites your two hearts in partnership." he  said as Naota and Lia turned to each other.</p><p>Reaching  into his kimono Naota took out a plain gold wedding band, and taking  Lias hand placed it on her ring finger. After he was done Lia reached  into her hakoseko (6) and took out a  identical, but larger, ring and placed it on his ring finger.</p><p>When  Lia was done they turned  to face the yard and their families assembled there as Lama Eno held  up a large katag(7)  over them.</p><p>"By  the power vested in me through the wishes of Lia and Naota, as well  as the blessing of the lineage of their Spiritual Friends, I now  pronounce you Husband and Wife." he said as he draped it over their  shoulders and stepped off to the side. "And ladies and  gentlemen, please join me in congratulating Mr. and Mrs Sano."</p><p>Naota  could have sworn her heard Akane gasp as the assembled family members  broke into applause as he and Lia walked to the porch. Both families  crowded around the happy couple to offer their congratulations  and well wishes.</p><p>"Nicely  done." said Dokuhotei as he patted Naota on the shoulder and handed  him another flask. "Here, have this."</p><p>"Why?"  Naota asked as he pocketed the flask.</p><p>"To  get you through the second half of the wedding." answered his  grandfather as Naota nodded in understanding.</p><p>Lia,  on the other hand was getting glomped by Ranma.</p><p>"How  did I look Daddy?" Lia asked as she was swept into a bear  hug.</p><p>"Wonderful."  Ranma answered. "Absolutely wonderful"  she added.</p><p>As  she hugged her father Lia looked around to see Akanes bishouen form  standing alone clutching his chest.</p><p>"Daddy,  is Mom okay?" she asked. "She looks like she's having a heart  attack."</p><p>Ranma  smiled as she released her daughter. "Kane's okay." she said as  she looked her daughter in the eye. "He's just getting his feminist  outrage over the fact you decided to take Naotas last name instead of  keep your own under control right now."</p><p>"Oh."  Lia said as she blinked in surprise. "I  guess we forgot to tell her."</p><p>Ranma  gave her daughter a puzzled look. "Tell her what?" she asked.</p><p>"Matoko  and I decided that <i>she </i>would  keep her maiden name." answered Lia. "With the wedding plans and  all I guess we forgot."</p><p>Ranma  sighed and shook her head. "Oh well." she said. "I'll talk to  her and get her calmed down." Ranma added as she looked over her  shoulder at Nodoka and a surprisingly human  Genma. "Meanwhile, I think Grandma and Grandpa want their turn with  you."</p><p>The  next thirty minutes were a blur as everyone crowded around the bride  and groom.</p><p></p><p>After  everyone had given their congratulations to the bride and groom they  wern't back into the house to get changed  for the second half of the wedding while everyone else milled around  outside and enjoyed snacks and refreshments thoughtfully provided by  Kasumi.</p><p>Inside  the sewing room Naota gladly shucked his kimono and stood in front of  a fan for a few moments, enjoying the feel of cool air flowing over  his body.</p><p>"Feeling  better?" Dokuhotei asked as he stepped in with a couple of glasses  of lemonade.</p><p>Naota  nodded as he took a glass from his grandfather. "Much better." he  said before draining the glass. "Thanks. I needed that." Naota  added.</p><p>Sipping  his glass Dokuhotei watched as his grandson turned around and let the  cool air flow over his back. "So, are you going to get dressed so  you can finish getting married, or what?" he asked.</p><p>"Hold  your horses." Naota answered in an annoyed tone. "I need a second  to cool off before I put on that penguin suit."</p><p>Dokuhotei  arched an eyebrow as he looked at his grandson. "Hey, you could  still be wearing that kimono you know." he said. "And if you  think it's stuffy in here, try the changing rooms at St. Hebekere."</p><p>"Well,  theres a reason for that, isn't there?" Naota asked as he flicked  one of his ears. "Hopefully just having  Father Fukida read us our vows won't cause  any side effects."</p><p>"Hopefully."  Dokuhotei sad with a nod. "And who knows, maybe in the future he  will be able to bless you and Lia."</p><p>"Heres  hoping." Naota echoed as he stepped over to the chair where his  tuxedo was draped. "Now to get this over with."</p><p>Pulling  on his pants Naota was surprised to find that they were actually  fairly comfortable, something due to their quality.</p><p>"<i>Score  one for family." </i>he thought as  he buttoned the tail hole closed.</p><p>Every  member of his extended family had chipped in for both his kimono and  his tuxedo. For weeks earlier they had been receiving letters  from and some cases actual family members arriving at his apartment.  This had enabled the purchase of both the material for his kimono  -which wasn't cheap- and the fitting of his tuxedo.</p><p>Fortunately  Akane had been there to help the tailor with the tail hole.</p><p>There  had even been enough left over to be set aside in what he and Lia  called the 'household fund', so that they would be well equipped to  enter domestic bliss. But before that...</p><p>"Hey  Grandpa, where are you Lia and I on honeymoon again?" Naota asked  as he affixed his bow tie.</p><p>"The  clan home. You know that." answered Dokuhotei.</p><p>Naota  finished tying his bow tie and admired his efforts in the mirror.  "Gary Cooper, eat you heart out." he  murmured before turning to his grandfather. "No, I meant after  that. You, and everybody else are up to something."</p><p>Dokuhotei  gave his grandson an odd look. "What are you talking about?" he  asked.</p><p>Naota  gave his grandfather a deadpan look. "Someones been calling various  airlines from the shop." he said. "I was checking the bills last  week and I noticed a few phone numbers that were out of place."</p><p>Dokuhotei  shrugged. "Okay, I'm up to something. I'm just not telling you  what." he said. "It may be related to your honeymoon, it may  not."</p><p>"Whatever."  answered Naota as he shrugged his jacket on. "After that bachelor  party stunt, I'm keeping an eye on you old man."</p><p>At  that Dokuhotei beamed. "My grandson is becoming paranoid  like a true Sano." he said. "That just warms my heart."</p><p>"Whatever."  Naota said as there was a knock at the door.</p><p>"You  ready?" Kenji asked, his voice muffled by the door.</p><p>Naota  looked at his grandfather, who nodded. "Yeah." he said as he  walked over to the door. "I'm ready."</p><p></p><p>Inside  the dojo Father Fukida was talking shop with Lama Eno when the  interior door to the dojo slid open and Lia stepped in. Outside the  conversations stopped as they took a look at the bride.</p><p>Simply  put, Lia was stunning. She had her hair unbound and brushed out, so  it was an auburn mane reaching down to the middle of her calves. She  wore no veil, and her dress was strapless,  made out of white cotton and gathered at  the waist before falling to the floor, stopping at her ankles.</p><p>Her bouquet was made out of wildflowers  in a nod to Ranmas days as 'Ranko', a fact  that made Ranma chuckle when she saw the bouquet. And for Akane Lias  face was scrubbed of makeup in a nod to her mothers 'tomboy' days.</p><p>Behind Lia was Matoko as her maid of  honor, dressed in a simple white dress as well, the long cut working  well with her height. Her hair too was unbound, falling to her waist  in brown waves the color of coffee.</p><p>A few moments after Lia  and Matoko entered Naota stepped into the dojo, eliciting  murmurs from the female members of the  audience. Dressed in his tuxedo with his broad shoulders, narrow  waist, the gold stripes on his face, combined with the rest of his  other feline traits Naota was definitely what women would call 'hot'.</p><p>Behind him came Kenji as his best man,  also dressed in a tuxedo and looking very handsome, a fact that was  not lost on Matoko.</p><p>Naota walked up to where Father Fukida  and Lia stood with a easy grace and stopped before them. Getting nods  from the both of them Father Fukida cleared his throat.</p><p>"Ladies and Gentlemen,  we are gathered here today to witness the joining of Naota Sano and  Lia Sano in holy matrimony." he said.  "Before we begin, I would like to say a few words about the subject  of marriage, and the journey before you."</p><p>Looking at Naota  and Lia Father Fukida continued. "I know that you two have had your  share of trials and tribulations." he said. "No matter what  happens, know this: God loves you both, and he sets the tasks before  you for a reason. If you keep love for each other in your hearts, and  keep yourselves humble, you will prevail."</p><p>he said as he pulled out a card from  his coat pocket. "And that being said, are there any here who  object to this union? If so, speak now, or forever hold your peace."</p><p>There was silence for a few moments,  then Father Fukida nodded and continued. Turning to Naota he spoke.</p><p>"Naota Sano, do you take this woman  to be your wife, to love and to cherish her, and to be faithful to  her always?"</p><p>"I do." answered Naota.</p><p>Turning to Lia Father Fukida spoke.</p><p>"Lia Sano, do you take this oni  to be your husband, to love and to cherish  him, and to be faithful to him always?'</p><p>"I do." Lia said with a nod.</p><p>"Then by the power vested in me by  our father in heaven, I pronounce you husband and wife." Father  Fukida said as he stepped back. Nodding to Naota he continued. "You  may now kiss the bride." he said.</p><p>Naota smiled as he turned and swept Lia  into a kiss, the fur on her tail standing  up on end as he gave her the second most  memorable kiss of her life as their families  burst into applause. Father Fukdia smiled  as he watched the two newlyweds kiss, and very reluctantly come up  for air.</p><p>"Sorry to interrupt,  but there are a couple of traditions that have to be observed."  Father Fukida said to them in a low voice.</p><p>"Oh, thats right." Naota said as he  looked at Lia- <i>"my wife. She's my wife." </i>he  thought. "the bouquet and ah..."</p><p>"Garter." Lia finished for him.</p><p>As they walked to the porch  Naota thought about some of the wedding traditions  he had heard Bre mention as they had planned the wedding. "Something  old, something borrowed, something blue." Naota said to himself.</p><p>"Huh?" Lia asked as she glanced  over at her new husband and mate of almost a year. "You say  something Naota?" she asked.</p><p>"Yeah." answered Naota. "You're  supposed to have something old, something borrowed, and something  blue." he said. "You borrowed the theme for your bouquet from  your fathers alter ego Ranko, you borrowed the tomboy approach from  your mother, so whats the blue?" he asked.</p><p>Lia leaned over and gave Naota a  conspiratorial wink. "You'll find out  this evening when we get home." she answered. "I got it from  Asako." she added.</p><p>The possibilities what that could be  intruiging Naota, and suddenly he found  himself wondering how long it was going to be until they could go  back to the apartment.</p><p>By the time they reached the porch the  audience had split into three groups: those  who were already married and those who either single males or single  females. Filling out both groups were several members of Naotas  family, who in true ninja fashion had seemingly materialized  out of thin air.</p><p>Stepping off the porch Lia turned  around and look over her shoulder at the small crowd of women who  standing behind her.</p><p>"On three." Lia called out. "One,  two, three!" she said before she tossed it into the air behind her.</p><p>The bouquet sailed up in an arc as it  headed straight for the group of women, who all strained and jostled  each other for a chance to grab it. As it fell towards the group  there was a sudden gust of wind and it was blown to the left. Matoko  made a grab for it, but was a half -second too late as it fell into  the out stretched hands of ... Bre.</p><p>"I got it!I got it!I got it!" Bre  shrieked as she jumped around waving the  bouquet while everyone else applauded. As her gaze came to rest on  Evans she broke out into a huge grin. "C'mere,  soilder boy..." she purred as she began  to stalk towards him.</p><p>Evans saw the look in her eye and found  himself swallowing nervously. Seeing the look on his daughters  face Kamone grinned and leaned over to Evans. "I'd run while you  can." he said as Bre charged at Evans.</p><p>Lia laughed as Bre chased Evans around  the yard waving the bouquet, while Naota found  himself vaugely irritated for some reason.  Filing it under 'things to threaten Evans about', he turned his mind  to the next task at hand.</p><p>Sitting down on the porch with her  right leg perched on a stool Lia had her  her skirt up to reveal a white satin and lace garter.</p><p>As Naota bent down Lia smiled demurely.  "No peeking." she warned.</p><p>"I wouldn't dream of it." Naota  answered as he gave her a Cheshire Cat grin.</p><p>Taking the lace in his teeth, Naota  then proceeded to lovingly pull Lias garter  down and off her leg. Standing up Naota hooked one end over his  finger and held it up over his head. Pulling it back he flicked like  a rubber band back at the crowd of men behind him.</p><p>It went up, higher than the walls of  the Saotome house, paused as it got caught in the wind, and then fell  back to earth, missing the single men to land in the hands of a very  surprised Takata, who said the first thing that came into his mind.</p><p>"I hope my wife dosen't  find out about this."</p><p></p><p>The celebration was in full swing when  Naota felt a tap on his shoulder. Looking up he saw Bre standing over  him.</p><p>"Hey Bre." he said. "Whats up?"</p><p>"Nabiki wants to talk to you and me."  she said. "Upstairs. She said it was important."</p><p>Frowning Naota nudged his wife and told  her what was going on, then got up and followed his sister upstairs  to the guest room where Nabiki was.</p><p>"You wanted to  talk to us?" Naota asked as he came in.</p><p>Nabiki nodded from where she kneel  ed on the tatami. "Y- yes." she said. "Shut the door  behind you please."</p><p>The noise from the party downstairs  dropped to a low throb in the background as Naota slid the door shut.  Nabiki waited until he had sat down with his sister before she spoke.</p><p>"Naota Bre do you remember your  mother?" she asked.</p><p>The two siblings looked  at each other for a moment before shanking  their heads.</p><p>"No." Bre answered. "I was put  for adoption when I was an infant, so all I know is what Kamone has  told me.'</p><p>"I have some vague  memories from when I was a kid, but thats it." Naota added. " I  don't even remember what her voice sounded  like." he said. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>Nabiki chewed on her lip for a second  before looking up at them. "The reason why I'm asking is because  your mother and I were best friends growing up." she said.</p><p>Naota and Bres reactions to Nabikis  statement were completely opposite of each  other: Bre got a curious look on her face while Naotas went into a  scowl.</p><p>Bre was the first to respond. "You  were? What was she like?" she asked.</p><p>Nabiki pursed her lips for a moment as  she considered how to put it, then shrugged. "A lot like you are  Bre." she said. "You take after her in a lot of ways. You sound  just like her." Nabiki said as a frown tugged at the corners if  her lips. "That's why I avoided you yesterday and today. It brought  back too many memories."</p><p>"How tragic." Naota muttered under  his breath, which caused Bre to give him a nasty look.</p><p>"Naota! Behave." she said.</p><p>Naota sighed and looked at Nabiki, then  turned his gaze to his sister. "I'm sorry Bre, but I barely  remember our mother, okay? She died when I was five." he said as he  glanced at Nabiki out of the corner of his eye. "And she's known  about me for at least two years." he added as Nabiki gulped. "And  why didn't you say anything, huh?"</p><p>"<i>He takes after his father, thats  for sure." </i>thought Nabiki as  she weathered his gaze. "I-i-its complicated." she said as Naota  turned his gaze on her.</p><p>"So tell me."</p><p>Nabiki sighed and  looked down at her hands for a moment. "We've met before, you know  that?" she said. "Several times in fact."</p><p>Naota narrowed his  eyes as he looked at Nabiki and wondered what she was getting at.  "When?" he asked.</p><p>Nabiki chuckled as  she looked up at Naota and Bre. "Well, the first time I met your  sister was on the day she was born." she answered as a look of pure  shock came across Bres face. "Likewise, I first met you when you  were born."</p><p>Naotas jaw about  hit the floor when Nabiki said that. She got the rare sight of Naota  being completely and utterly in shock.</p><p>"You- you -you?'  he stammered as he pointed at his aunt.</p><p>Nabiki  nodded as Naota shook his head. "Yes." she answered. "Like I  said, your mother and I were best friends. We did all the usual girl  stuff together as we grew up. Sleep overs, gossip,... we discovered  a lot of interesting things. Cafeteria  food, clothes, ... <i>boys.</i>"  added Nabiki. "And that's where it gets complicated."</p><p>Getting up Nabiki  walked over to the closet and slid it open. Reaching in she took out  a large white box and carried it back to where they were sitting,  placing it between them.</p><p>"Your father is  the reason." said Nabiki "I don't know if you two know this, but  when I was younger, before I got married and settled down, I was very  mercenary."</p><p>Watching Nabiki  wake out a smaller box out Naota nodded. "Lia mentioned that a  while ago. She didn't specify anything though." he said.</p><p>Bre nodded too.  "Ranma mentioned that too." she said.</p><p>"To put it  bluntly, I was greedy." Nabiki said as she took out another  package. "I exploited Akane, Ranma, my husband, pretty much  anybody- except for Haruko."</p><p>Naotas face  twitched as he crossed his arms. "Why not?" he asked.</p><p>Nabiki sighed as  she slid the larger box out of the way. "Honestly? I was afraid she  would knock me upside the head with a guitar."</p><p>Naotas  mind immediately thought about the 54' Strat  sitting on its stand in the bachelor bad, and nearly had a heart  attack. Seeing his expression Nabiki immediately shook her head.</p><p>"Not that one!" she said. "She  summoned them, like Akane and Lia do with  their mallets!"</p><p>Bre brightened at that possibility  while Naota breathed a sigh of relief. Slightly troubled by the look  on Bres face Nabiki continued. "As I said, I exploited people for  money." she said. "Most of which was through blackmail."</p><p>Hunched over  as he took deep breaths, Naotas ears twitched at the word 'blackmail'  and he looked back up at Nabiki.</p><p>"You tried to dig up dirt on Dad,  didn't you?" he asked. "And succeeded."</p><p>Nabiki nodded as she swallowed  nervously. "I found out what he was." she said. "And i was  concerned that Haruko might get hurt. So I tried to blackmail you  twos father into braking up with her."</p><p>Naota snorted in amusement as he leaned  back onto his elbows. "Didn't work, did it?" he asked  rhetorically.</p><p>Nabiki shivered as she shook her head.  "He put a gun to my head and said that if I told her, my whole  family was dead." she said shakily. "So I didn't, and things went  on from there."</p><p>Naota took it like it was business  as usual, while Bre was a little shocked by it. "he -he- threatened  your whole family?" she asked as she  looked ad Bre and then Naota.</p><p>Naota nodded as he looked back at Bre.  "Of course he did." he answered. "If she had told our mom about  Dad, she would have put a bullseye on her." he said as he glanced  at Nabiki. "You'd still have a bullseye on yourself if I hadn't  taken care of the School, you know that?"</p><p>Nabiki nodded jerkily as picked up one  of the boxes. "Y- yes. I do know that." she said. "Like I was  saying, things went on from there." Nabiki said as she looked at  the box in her hands, then at Bre. "They continued dating, and then  you came into the pitcures Bre."</p><p>"What happened?" Bre asked.</p><p>"Well," Nabiki said as she toyed  with the box. "I was there with your mother when you were born, and  I was there with her when you went away." she said. "I helped her  through her depression over losing you. Then, we went to college, and  everything was fine." Nabiki continued. "I was also with her at  the doctors office when she discovered she was pregnant  with you Naota."</p><p>Naotas ear twitched as he listened, but  said nothing as Nabiki continued narrating.</p><p>"She was so happy to have you,  Naota." Nabiki said. "She was whole again. And so was your  father- but he was sad too. Because he and Haruko were married now,  and that meant you were quote 'legitimate'  unquote." she added. "And then I had Chisu, and we didn't talk as  much as we used to, because we had our hands full with our sons."  Nabiki said with a chuckle.</p><p>"Then, one day, out of the blue I get  a phone call from Haruko." Nabiki said as she looked at the package  in her hands. "She wanted my help with a present for your fifth  birthday." she said. "So, I went over to your apartment and she  gave me her entire body of work so I could put it on CD so you could  develop your talent better."</p><p>Nabiki shuddered as she held up the  box. "I was delivering this when I found out about what had  happened." she said. "I arrived at the apartment to find it  swarming with police. When I finally found out what happened I was  upset, to say the least. I tracked you and your father down at the  police station, and I confronted him." Nabiki said as she swallowed  nervously. "I said some horrible, horrible, things to him, things I  regret to this day. And I kept your mothers work."</p><p>Naota sighed as he looked at Nabiki.  "So you didn't tell me to spite my father?" he asked.</p><p>"At first." Nabiki said as she  placed the box in front of Naota and the other box in front of Bre.  "Then it was shame. I can't go back in time to correct what I did,  but perhaps I can make amends. Bre, Naota, these are yours. It's your  copies of your mothers work."</p><p>"What about the originals?" Naota  asked as he picked up the box.</p><p>"Those I'm giving back to your  father." Nabiki said as she sat back. "I hope I didn't open any  wounds."</p><p>"No." Naota said as he opened the  box and took a look inside. "Dad always said I got my talent from  mom, and now I get listen to her." he said as he looked up at  Nabiki. "Thank you -and sorry for being a dick there, I'm a little  touchy when it comes to my mom."</p><p>"You're not the only one." Nabiki  answered. "Could you tell your father that I'd like to talk  to hm when you go down?" she asked.</p><p>"Sure." Naota said as he put the  lid back on the box.</p><p></p><p>"My plate!"</p><p>Ranma and Naota  looked up at the shout from Kenji.</p><p>"the hell?"  Naota muttered as his hand automatically  began to index his SOCOM.</p><p>Ranma on the other  hand groaned and rolled her eyes. "Not him..." she muttered as  a Caucasian man about her age appeared on the porch.</p><p>Naotas response was  to put on his poker face and quietly draw his pistol, keeping it low  and pressed up against his side. "You know this putz?"  he asked Ranma in a low voice as the stranger looked around at his  surroundings.</p><p>Ranma nodded  slightly as she responded in an equally low voice. "Yeah, I know  him. He tried to marry Akane, then me. After that, he tried to get me  to sign a contract promising one of my daughters in marriage." she  said, annoyance creeping into her voice.</p><p>"So why is he  here, and how come Uncle Hideki hasn't dropped him yet?" Naota  asked as he and Ranma glanced around for a panda.</p><p>"Don't know."  Ranma answered as the stranger cleared his throat.</p><p>"I am Picolet  Chardin the Second, and I am here for my  bride, Lia Saotome." he said, his Japanese carrying a slight French  accent as he pointed to Lia.</p><p>In the ensuing  silence the four quiet clicks of safeties being thrown off seemed  incredibly loud. Picolet froze when he found himself looking down the  combined barrels of Naota, Evans, Kamone, Dokuhotei, and Bre (8). Off  to the side he noticed a extremely tall girl holding a katana along  with a middle aged man.</p><p>"I hate to break  this to you, but there isn't a Lia Saotome here." Naota said, his  dead calm. "There's only a Lia Sano, and she's my wife. So unless  you want to end up dead or worse, I suggest you run." he added as  he nestled the red dot of his laser sight in the middle of Picolet's  forehead, and much to his joy, two others appeared as well.</p><p>Stepping out so  where Picolet could see her Ranma spoke. "Give it up, Picolet. I  won years ago, fair and square, and I didn't promise you my  daughters." she said as she crossed her arms.</p><p>Picolet laughed  lightly as he carefully reached into his suit jacket and took out a  folded piece of paper. "Ah, but your father <i>did</i>." he said  as he unfolded it. "To wit: I, Genma Saotome, do hereby promise the  hand of my eldest granddaughter in marriage to one Picolet Chardin.  Signed, Genma Saotome." he read aloud with a smirk. "Does that  clear thing up?" he asked.</p><p>Pausing to shoot a  death glare at the panda trying to sneak out of the room Ranma  crossed her arms and planted her feet. "Ah, you're wrong there  buddy." she said. "My daughter will marry whoever she feels like,  and thats Naota here." she said as she patted him on the shoulder.  "And he has a whole bunch of reasons why you should leave while you  can."</p><p>"Yeah." Naota  said as he cocked the hammer back on his pistol "Thirteen of them,  plus one in the chamber." he said.</p><p>"Excuse me."  Lia said as she stood up. "Could everyone tone down the  testosterone while I say something?" she asked.</p><p>Seeing the look in  her eye Naota shrugged and lowered his weapon into the ready  position. "Shoot." he said.</p><p>"Whatever you  say my lovely." Picolet said as he bowed slightly to her.</p><p>"Thank you."  Lia said as she stepped out so where there was no one in her line of  sight. "What I have to say is this: PERVERT SMASHER!"</p><p>When the purple  dots finally cleared from in front of his eyes Naota saw that there  was a nice, new hole in the Saotome wall and Picolet was nowhere to  be seen. Looking over at Lia he was surprised to see that she was  still standing, completely unaffected by the expenditure of chi like  she normally was after doing a Pervert Smasher.</p><p>"You okay?"  Naota asked, to which Lia nodded. "How...how  did you do that?" he asked.</p><p>Lia smiled and  shrugged as she turned to face him. "Easy. I simply tapped of a  part of the rage I'm feeling right now to power it." she answered.</p><p>"And the rest?"  asked Naota.</p><p>"The rest I'm  going to use to power another attack of mine." she said as she  summoned her favorite mallet from Hammerspace. "PANDA NO BAKA!"   she screamed as she launched herself at her grandfather.</p><p>Genma proved that  he still had his agility in his old age as he nimbly leaped  out of the way from Lias mallet. Landing on all fours he immediately  crabbed sideways to avoid another mallet strike from Lia, which left  a good sized crater in the yard.</p><p>As the dust cleared  from the mallet strike Lia was clearly not there. Genma began  sweating bullets as he looked around for his granddaughter.  Unfortunately for him he forgot to look behind his head as thats  exactly where Lia materialized, her mallet  poised to strike.</p><p>"BAKA BASHER!"  she screamed as she swung her mallet home. As the dust cleared Lia  was standing over the inert body of her grandfather, who was embedded  face first into the dirt. "Honestly. Every. Freaking. TIME!" she  growled through gritted teeth.</p><p>Releasing her  mallet back into Hammerspace Lia turned around and stalked back into  the house to cool off. As Naota put his pistol away Ranma sighed and  stretched.</p><p>"Well, now every  things complete." she said. "Someones beaten the stuffing  out of the panda."</p><p>"True." Naota  said as he picked up his drink. "I was wondering when that was  going to happen." he said.</p><p></p><p>It was two AM when  the newlyweds finally made back to their apartment, having roof  hopped their way over.</p><p>"Well, here we  are." Lia said as they stepped into the apartment. "Our first  night as a married couple."</p><p>"Yep." Naota  said as he flipped on the lights and shut the door behind him. "And  now to get the fans going before we roast..."</p><p>"Okay." Lia  said as she began to unbutton her blouse.  "I'll go lay out the futon.'</p><p>Naota nodded as he  finished opening windows and turning on  fans. Stopping at the fridge he got a bottle of water out and opened  it. As he pondered on whether or not to get a late night snack heard  the <i>thump </i>of his futon hitting the floor.</p><p>He was narrowing it  down to what types of leftovers he would like when his world went  white as Lias blouse landed on his head. Pulling it off he turned  around and saw... blue lace... lots of cleavage... and lots  and <i>lots </i>of skin as Lia stood in front of him, clad in some of  the sexiest lingerie Asako had in her shop.</p><p>"Urk!" was all  that Naota could say as Lia stepped up close to him.</p><p>"This is part of  that present I mentioned..." Lia purred. "The rest of it is in  the bedroom." she added as Naota crushed his water bottle in his  fist.</p><p>Naota blinked a  couple of times before he shook his head and looked Lia in the eye.  "You sneaky little..." he said as she skipped backwards, out of  reach. "Get back here!"</p><p>"Gotta catch  me first!" Lia said as she turned and flicked her tail at Naota.</p><p>"Oh, you're in  for it now!" Naota said as he followed her into the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>(1)A chocolate  milkshake, just in case you're wondering.</p><p>(2)Thats the  family name for said hangover.</p><p>(3)  Thats Tatewakis nickname for Nabiki.</p><p>(4) He's referring to the Hagakure clan's  ancestral home in the mountains of Hokkadio.</p><p>(5) Thats the term for Evans full dress uniform.  He has another term for them, but it's generally  unprintable.</p><p>(6) Thats a small, sack -like purse  carried by the bride.</p><p>(7) thats a scarf that  is a religious vestment by Buddhists.</p><p>(8) Bre was using a Glock,  which has automatic safeties, so it'll  only fire if you pull the trigger.</p>
