</div><p>1Ranma Onehalf: First steps. Book Four.</p><p>Chapter One.</p><p>Akane hummed to herself as she poured her self her second cup of tea for the day. Hearing the doorbell ring she glanced up at the clock, which read seven AM. Mouth quirked up in a smile she got up to answer the door.</p><p>"<i>You could set your watch by that boy." </i>Akane thought as she walked to the door.</p><p>Opening the door she found Naota standing on the front stoop, wearing a t -shirt and a pair of baggy jeans.</p><p>"Good morning Naota." Akane said. "Come on in."</p><p>"Good morning." Naota answered. "You're up early."</p><p>"I teach the morning classes, so I'm usually up first." Akane said as Naota stepped into the mud room. "And Naota, when I said be here at seven, I didn't mean on the dot."</p><p>Naota blinked. "Oh, I'm sorry. I can come back later if you want..."</p><p>"It's alright." Akane said, dismissing it with a wave of her hand. "There's tea if you want it. And Matokos making breakfast."</p><p>"Thank you." Naota said with a nod of his head.</p><p>"You're welcome" Akane said as they stepped out of the mud room. "So, how are you adjusting to being a demon?"</p><p>"I'll live." Naota said with a shrug.</p><p>"Thats the spirit." Akane said.</p><p>"Though the tail is taking some getting used to." Naota said. "Keeping it wrapped around my waist is getting to be a hassle."</p><p>Akane nodded as they stepped into the main room. "Lia had the same kind trouble until I started putting tail holes in her clothes." she said.</p><p>"What kind of trouble?" Lia asked as she came downstairs. "Morning Naota."</p><p>"We were talking about my tail." Naota said. "And good morning to you too."</p><p>Lia nodded as she yawned. She stopped short as her sleep fogged brain realized she was wearing only her sleep shirt and panties.</p><p>"Ah, excuse me." she said before running back upstairs.</p><p>"Oo-kay." Akane said as she watched Lias departure. "How about I go get you some breakfast? It should be about done."</p><p>"That would be nice. Thank you." Naota said as he dropped his duffle and sat down.</p><p>Akane walked into the kitchen as Lia came thumping back down the stairs, now with a pair of shorts and a bra on.</p><p>"Sorry about running off there." Lia said as she sat down next to Naota. "But I forgot you were coming over and I had to make myself -ah, decent."</p><p>"Ah." Naota said with a nod.</p><p>"So, how you doing?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Why is everyone asking me that?" Naota asked.</p><p>Lia shrugged. "Because we're concerned, that's why." Lia said. "And there's the business with up there." she added, pointing to the ceiling.</p><p>"Oh. Well, I'm holding together." Naota said. "As for up there, I just don't know."</p><p>"I'm sure there's a reason behind all of this." Lia said. "Don't worry, we'll figure it out."</p><p>"I hope." Naota said as Akane came in with a tray loaded with breakfast.</p><p>"Breakfast!" Akane said as she put the tray down. "Before you eat Naota get changed into your school uniform and I'll take your measurements."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said as Lia began to dish out rice.</p><p>Getting up Naota grabbed his duffle and headed to the bathroom and few minutes later came out wearing the slacks and white button down shirt which was the Furinkan boys uniform. Akane by then had gotten out his trusty tape ruler and let it un wind.</p><p>"You changed forms." Naota stated as Akane walked up to him.</p><p>Akane nodded as he grabbed Naotas hips and turned him around so his butt was facing him.</p><p>"Turn around, I need to see your butt." he said. "I figured it'd be less embarrassing for you if I was male and doing the measurements rather than if I was female, especially after what happed two days ago."</p><p>Naotas cheeks colored at the memory and he nodded. "Thank you." he said. "Ow!"</p><p>"Sorry." Akane said as he looked up. "Unwrap your tail, it'll make it easier."</p><p>"Oh. Sorry." Naota said as he loosened his tail.</p><p>Once loosened Akane was easily able to locate the base of Naotas tail and where to put the tail hole.</p><p>"All done." Akane said. "You can go change out of those now."</p><p>"Thank you." Naota said as he turned and headed to the bathroom.</p><p>"By the way, is there anything you want modified first?" Akane asked as he picked up Naotas duffle.</p><p>"There's a pair of cargo shorts in the bag. Them and a pair of boxers would be nice." Naota said.</p><p>Much to Naotas surprise Akane had the items he requested modified done by the time he finished breakfast.</p><p>"That was quick." he said as he took his clothes.</p><p>"Well, I have a lot of experience." Akane said. "I put tail holes in all of Lias clothing."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said as he headed off to the bathroom to change. A few minutes later Naota stepped out, his tail gently swaying behind. "Much better." he said.</p><p>"Does it fit?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Perfectly." Naota said as he twitched his tail.</p><p>"I told ya, Mom does good work." Lia said as she stood up with her dishes.</p><p>"That she does." Naota said as he picked up his dishes.</p><p>Stepping into the kitchen with Lia Naota saw Matoko standing at the sink washing a pan. She looked up as Lia and Naota put their dishes on the counter.</p><p>"Oh, morning Lia. Did you like breakfast..." Matoko trailed off as she saw Naota. Swallowing she nodded at him. "Naota."</p><p>"It was delicious Matoko." Lia said.</p><p>"It was." Naota agreed. "Really."</p><p>"Thank you." Matoko said as her face went pink.</p><p>Turning they headed to the door to go outside.</p><p>"Wait."</p><p>"What is it Matoko?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Naota, I want to ...to..." Matoko stuttered as her blushed deeper.</p><p>"Apologize?" Naota said as he took a guess.</p><p>Matoko nodded jerkily. "Yes. I'm sorry that I walked in on you when you were-"</p><p>"Apology accepted." Naota said with a bow to Matoko. "And don't worry about it. It was an accident."</p><p>"Okay." Matoko said before turning back to the sink.</p><p>Feeling decidedly awkward Naota stepped out of the kitchen as Matoko began to re-wash the pan. Lia would have laughed at the situation but for the fact she was trying to keep the memory of what happened down and prevent her from getting a nosebleed.</p><p>"You want to get some air?" Lia asked, nudging Naota in the side.</p><p>"Yeah." Naota said with a nod.</p><p>"You want to go to the roof?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Sure." Naota said.</p><p>Stepping outside they both jumped up onto the roof, Lia going automatically to her favorite spot while Naota looked back over the edge to the ground.</p><p>"You lose something?" Lia asked as she sat down.</p><p>"No." Naota answered with a shake of his head. "Just surprised I can jump this high."</p><p>Lia gave Naota an odd look as she made herself comfortable.</p><p>"What are you talking about Naota? You've been jumping roofs for past couple months." she said.</p><p>"Yeah, but I had to focus my chi to do it." Naota said as he walked over to Lia. "Now it's effortless."</p><p>Lia gave Naota a toothy grin as he sat down. "See? Being a cat -demon isn't so bad." she said.</p><p>"Well, that's one way to put it." Naota said. "And it's not the only thing about me that's changed. My senses have gotten a <i>lot </i>better."</p><p>"Really? How good are they?" Lia asked.</p><p>Naota turned his head and triangulated his hears like he was listening to a distant sound. Looking at his watch his lips moved as he did some mental arithmetic. Looking back up at Lia naotas mouth quirked into a slight smile.</p><p>"Your pulse is currently eighty -two beats per minute." he said.</p><p>"No way. Let me see your watch." Lia said as she laid her fingers on her wrist. Dutifully Naota held out his arm and Lia read off the time. "Your right." she said as she sat back.</p><p>"Demonic hearing." Naota said, flicking an ear for emphasis. "And you like to use cucumber based beauty products."</p><p>Lias eyes went wide as she realized Naota was telling the truth. "You can smell the hand lotion I use?" she asked. "I used that over twelve hours ago, after I washed the dinner dishes!"</p><p>Looking away Lia blinked in surprise. "Your senses are better than mine." she said to herself.</p><p>"Yeah. And my clan knows it too." Naota said. "Lucky me."</p><p>"I take it that's a bad thing." Lia said as she looked at her hands.</p><p>"Very." Naota said as he scowled at a pair of robins who were being far too cheerful at the moment. "It means there's almost no way now I can avoid damnation."</p><p>"Huh?" Lia asked, not getting his reference.</p><p>Naota glanced at Lia out of the corner of his eye as he continued. "Ninjas kill people Lia." he said. "And God was very specific, you know? 'Thou shalt not kill' and all that."</p><p>"Oh. Sorry." Lia said quietly.</p><p>"It's okay." Naota said as he remembered something he'd been meaning to tell Lia. "By the way, there's something I want to talk to you about." he said.</p><p>"Shoot." Lia said as she flopped back onto her back.</p><p>"It's about me as a ninja." Naota began. "And how it affects you and your family."</p><p>Lia propped herself up onto her elbows and looked at Naota. "Let me guess, by you're being a ninja you've put me and my family in mortal danger, right?" she asked. At Naotas surprised expression she grinned. "Dad told me already."</p><p>"You're not upset about that?" Naota asked.</p><p>Lia shook her head as she lay back down. "Nope." she said.</p><p>"How come?" he asked.</p><p>"Ask my Dad about when he was growing up."Lia said. "A lot of his old playmates are still wandering around out there and they ain't lightweights either."</p><p>"Oh." Naota said as he leaned back on his elbows. "Who are they?"</p><p>"Pantyhose Taro and Kodachi Kuno are the only ones I remember him talking about." Lia said. "And I'm sure there are others."</p><p>"Huh. Well, that was a surprise." Naota said.</p><p>"Eh, this is par for the course in my family." Lia said. "Though Dad was far from happy about it."</p><p>"Really?" Naota asked, arching an eyebrow at Lia.</p><p>"Yeah, really. After you left the other day he went over to my grandparents house and had a talk with Grandpa Saotome." Lia said. "The docs say he should be out of traction in a another month."</p><p>"Oy." Naota said as looked up at the early morning clouds.</p><p>"Lia! Naota!"</p><p>Lia sat up at the sound of her fathers voice.</p><p>"Yeah dad?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Get down here. It's time for Naotas lesson." Ranma said.</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>In the dojo Naota stood in front of a female Ranma, Lia at her side.</p><p>"Okay Naota, today is your first lesson in the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts." Ranma said. Naota nodded and she continued. "Because you already know martial arts,"</p><p>"Obviously." Naota said with a nod.</p><p>"I'm going to start you off with the principals of Anything Goes." Ranma said as she began to walk in a circle. "Or in other words I'll be teaching you how to reapply what you know."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said as he turned to face Ranma. "So what's the first lesson?"</p><p>"Let me show you." Ranma said as she stopped in front of Lia and held out her hand.</p><p>Ranmas hand blurred for a moment before she lowered it. Lia stood and wondered what Ranma was going to tell Naota when she felt a sudden draft. Looking at Naota she saw him look at her and his eyes go wide. Looking down Lia saw she now only clad in a sports bra and shorts, her shirt now a cloud of ribbons drifting to the floor.</p><p>Ranma used their distraction to plant a mid -level kick in Naotas gut, knocking him through the open dojo doors and into the yard. Dropping to the floor Ranma used her momentum to knock Lia off her feet.</p><p>Standing up Ranma looked at the two teens as they got to their feet.</p><p>"<i>That </i>is Anything Goes." she said. Ranma looked at Naota as he stepped back into the dojo, rubbing his stomach. "Can you tell me what I did Naota?"</p><p>Stopping out of arms reach Naota nodded.</p><p>"You used cutting off Lias shirt as a distraction, catching us both off guard." Naota said. "It's an old ninja trick."</p><p>"Exactly. Use your environment and knowledge to defeat your opponent." Ranma said. "That's it's basic principal in a nutshell."</p><p>"But I take it there's more to it than that." Naota said.</p><p>"You got it." Ranma said with a nod. "So I want you to use that while you spar with Lia."</p><p>"<i>After </i>I get a new shirt." Lia said as she glowered at her father. "That was a mean trick Dad."</p><p>Ranma shrugged as she looked at Lia. "It's Anything Goes Lia." she said. "Remember what I taught you?"</p><p>"Yeah." Lia said as she headed for the dojo door. "But I still don't like my skin being used as a distraction."</p><p>"Thats why I did it Lia." Ranma said as Lia went into the hall. "This is another part of the training you've been having for the past couple of months."</p><p>"I still don't like it." Lia said as she walked down the hall.</p><p>Passing Akane in the hall Lia nodded to her as she went to the stairs.</p><p>"What happened to your shirt?" Akane asked as she looked behind her.</p><p>"It got shredded during a demonstration of Anything Goes." Lia said as she walked up the stairs.</p><p>"Oo-kay." Akane said as she continued to the dojo. Sliding the door open she poked her head in. "Hey Ranma, phone call. It's your mother."</p><p>"I got it." Ranma said as he headed to the door.</p><p>A few minutes later Lia came back down with a fresh shirt on and headed to the dojo. Naota was sitting cross -legged on the floor with his back to her. Feeling a sudden impulse for mischief Lia grinned and invoked the Umi -Sen -Ken.</p><p>With incredible stealthiness Lia snuck up to Naota and stood behind him. Carefully Lia reached out and gave Naotas ears a tweaking. His reaction was not what Lia expected however.</p><p>Instead of reacting in surprise Naota snapped back and planted an elbow into Lias stomach. Staggering backwards Lia clutched at her stomach as Naota rolled to his feet. Shifting into the crane stance Naota egged Lia on.</p><p>Lia grinned and took Naota up on his offer. She shifted slightly onto the balls of her feet</p><p>and rocketed forward towards Naota, catching him off guard. His training took effect and he countered her attack with one of his own, lashing out with a kick.</p><p>She countered by skating sideways and letting loose a barrage of punches that broke off Naotas next attack. Naota managed to block some of the punches but most got through. Lia continued to press her attack, not letting Naota have a break.</p><p>Feeling the pressure Naota dropped and spun in a sweeper kick in an attempt to knock Lia off her feet. She jumped over the kick in a back flip, landing on her hands. Pushing up with her hands Lia shot up and let her feet touch the ceiling.</p><p>And she stayed there.</p><p>Naota blinked as Lia slowly spun in place to face him. Grinning she held out her hand and beckoned for Naota to come at her.</p><p>"So what are you going to do now, Naota?" Lia asked.</p><p>Naota was silent as he considered his options. As he thought he idly noticed Lias pigtail was hanging down, nearly touching the floor. Then inspiration struck.</p><p>"<i>Anything Goes..." </i>Naota thought to himself.</p><p>Looking Lia in the eye Naota returned her grin and gave her a wink, then in one fluid motion yanked his shirt off. Lias eyes went huge as she got an eyeful of Naotas bare chest. Hormones overloaded her brain and her concentration slipped, disrupting the sk8ter technique.</p><p>Naota winced as Lia hit the floor with a loud 'thud'. As he looked at Lia lying on the floor with a major nosebleed Naota shook his head.</p><p>"That <i>had </i>to hurt." he said.</p><p>"What did?"</p><p>Naota looked up and saw Akane standing in the doorway of the dojo with a picture of lemonade and a pair of glasses.</p><p>"Oh, Lias landing." Naota said, jerking a thumb at Lia. "She was standing on the ceiling using that chi technique of hers and she fell."</p><p>"I can see why." Akane said as she eyed Naotas chest.</p><p>Naota looked down at himself and chuckled. "Well, Ranma <i>did </i>say to use Anything Goes while we sparred." he said with a shrug.</p><p>Akane watched as Naotas shrug caused for her a very interesting series of actions on his anatomy.</p><p>"<i>Damn, but that boy is </i>hot.<i> No wonder Lia reacts like she does." </i>she thought. <i>"Still, I'll take Ranma any day." </i></p><p>"Well, put your shirt back on and I'll go get something for Lia to clean up with." Akane said as she put the tray down. "Matoko made some lemonade for you two."</p><p>"Tell her I said thank you." Naota said as he pulled his shirt on.</p><p>"I will." Akane said as she stepped out.</p><p>Pouring himself a glass Naota sat down and waited as Lia came around. Groaning she sat up and rubbed her head.</p><p>"Welcome back." Naota said as Lia gingerly felt her head.</p><p>"Ow." Lia said as she found a knot forming on her scalp. "You used my weakness."</p><p>"It's Anything Goes Lia." Naota said, sipping his lemonade. "Matoko made lemonade for us."</p><p>"Oh. Are you covered?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm covered." Naota answered.</p><p>"Then pour me a glass." Lia said as she got to her feet.</p><p>As Naota filled the second glass Lia walked over to him and sat down. Handing Lia her glass Naota saw her still feeling around her scalp.</p><p>"You okay?" Naota asked.</p><p>Lia nodded very gently. "Yeah. I'm a Saotome, we have hard heads." she said. "I'd worry about the floor."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said. "Sorry about pulling my shirt off-"</p><p>"Don't be." Lia said with a wave of her hand. "It's Anything Goes. You're supposed to do that. Besides, I should apologize for walking in on <i>you.</i>"</p><p>"Oh. Well, I'll quit doing it in the future anyways." Naota said, enjoying the taste of the lemonade.</p><p>Lia looked up at him and gave him a scowl. "Don't you dare, Naota Sano! You hold back on me and I'll kick your ass all over Honshu(1)." she said. "No one holds back on me! Ever!"</p><p>"But what about what happens when I do that?" Naota asked.</p><p>"I hate it when that happens Naota." Lia said. "It's embarrassing."</p><p>"So why don't you want me to stop?" Naota asked, confused.</p><p>"So I become immune, that's why." Lia said. "It's the same reason we were sparring."</p><p>"Oh, I see." Naota said as he finished the last of his lemonade.</p><p>As Naota poured himself another glass a young boys scream came from the front of the house. Naota looked up in concern as Lia merely twitched an ear. Hearing the scream turn from a boys to a girls naota realized who it was from.</p><p>"Your brothers awake I see." Naota said as he sipped his lemonade.</p><p>Lia nodded. "Yeah. Sounds like Christian forgot it was a training day(2)." she said.</p><p>"Ah." Naota said as two sets of footsteps pounded in the hall.</p><p>The door slid open, banging in its tracks as Christian and Mamimi burst into the dojo. Lia handed her lemonade to Naota as Christian charged towards her.</p><p>"LIAAAAA! HELP!" Christian said as she bowled his sister over.</p><p>Lia looked up into her brothers green eyes as she clutched Lias shirt.</p><p>"Since when does the mighty Christian Saotome need the help of his sister?" Lia asked.</p><p>"LIA, GRANDMA SAOTOMES COMING OVER!" Christian screamed.</p><p>Christian flew backwards as Lia sat bolt upright as Naotas tail fur stood on end.</p><p>"Naota, we gotta get out of here." Lai said as she grabbed her lemonade back from Naota. "Finish your lemonade."</p><p>"I agree." Naota said before tossing his back.</p><p>Putting her glass down Lia looked at Christian, who was looking around expecting Nodoka to appear at any moment.</p><p>"Where's Matoko?" she asked.</p><p>"She's gone to the library." Christian said.</p><p>"Okay. I'll carry you, Naota you get Mamimi." Lia said as she picked up her brother.</p><p>"What about my pack?" Mamimi asked.</p><p>"We'll swing by the mud room." Lia said as Naota turned his back to Mamimi.</p><p>"You can ride piggy back Mamimi." Naota said.</p><p>"Okay." Mamimi said as she stepped up to Naota. As he picked her up Mamimi looked at his ears. "Oooh, cute!" she said.</p><p>"Ah, thank you." Naota said as he stepped out side with Lia.</p><p>"Can I feel them?" Mamimi asked as naotas eyes bugged out.</p><p>"No!" Lia and Naota chorused.</p><p>"Why not?" Mamimi asked as they neared the mud room.</p><p>Naota worked his mouth up and down as he tried to figure out how to explain to a girl who was eight, going on nine that his ears were some of the most pleasure sensitive parts of his anatomy.</p><p>"Ahhh..." he began.</p><p>"I'll explain it to you later Mamimi, okay?" Lia asked.</p><p>"Okay." Mamimi said as Lia opened the door and grabbed Mamimis pack.</p><p>"Lets go." Lia said as they headed to the gate.</p><p>"Where to?" Christian asked.</p><p>"Anywhere." Lia said. "As long as it's away from Grandma."</p><p>Sliding the door open to the dojo Akane poked her head in and looked around. Seeing only the tray with empty glasses and a half empty jug of lemonade she shrugged. Stepping into the dojo Akane collected them and then returned to the kitchen where Ranma was finishing drying the breakfast dishes.</p><p>Putting the tray on the counter she looked at Ranma.</p><p>"Well, Lia and Naota are gone." she said.</p><p>"That's good." Ranma said as Akane put the picture in the refrigerator. "The last thing I want is Naota here when she shows up. After what I'm gonna tell her Moms gonna be upset."</p><p>"How come?" Akane asked. "Didn't you talk to her when you went over?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "Nope. I just showed up, beat Pops to a pulp, and left." he said. "I told her I'd explain later."</p><p>"Oh." Akane said with a grimace. "Odds are she's gonna have the katana with her."</p><p>"Yep." Ranma said. "Last thing I want is for Naota to have to defend himself."</p><p>"You afraid he'd hurt her?" Akane asked.</p><p>"No, I'm afraid she'd trip and accidently stab him." Ranma said.</p><p>"Ah." Akane said. "What about us?"</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Well, there is only the two of us here, so there's less to worry about."</p><p>"True." Akane said.</p><p>Meanwhile Lia and Naota arrived at Naotas apartment building, landing on the balcony.</p><p>"So why are we here?" Christian asked as Lia let he down.</p><p>"Easy. This is the one place we can be with out our classmates seeing us." Lia said as Naota let down Mamimi.</p><p>"Oh." Christian said.</p><p>"I'm gonna go tell Dad and Grandpa whats up." Naota said as he slid the door open.</p><p>"Kay." Lia said as she felt a tug on her shirt. Looking down she saw Mamimi looking back up at her. "Yes Mamimi?"</p><p>"You were going to tell me why I can't scratch Naota behind the ears." Mamimi said.</p><p>"Oh, yeah, that's right." Lia said as she squatted down to be eye to eye with the girl. "You see, Mamimi, that's a really... ah <i>sensitive </i>area and very personal, okay?"</p><p>"Oh. Okay." Mamimi said as she began to turn red with embarrassment.</p><p>Seeing the other girls embarrassment Lia patted her on the shoulder.</p><p>"Hey, don't be embarrassed. You didn't know." Lia said.</p><p>"Okay." Mamimi said before going over to stand next to Christian.</p><p>Lia looked up as Naota poked his head out of the apartment.</p><p>"Well?" she asked.</p><p>"You can come in now." Naota said. "It's just my dad who's home. If he gets too annoying just hit him."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said as she stood up. "Can I use your phone? I have to check in and let my parents know where I am."</p><p>"It's in the kitchen." Naota said as he stood aside for Christian and Mamimi.</p><p>Stepping inside Lia found the apartment much the same as she last remembered it, the only notable change being Naotas father embedded face -first in the wall. Lia stopped and looked at Naotas father before shrugging and continuing on to the kitchen.</p><p>Taking the phone off the hook Lia dialed the home number and listened to the ring tones before it was picked up.</p><p>"Moshi moshi." Akanes voice answered.</p><p>"Mom? It's Lia. I'm at Naotas with Christian and Mamimi." Lia said. "When will it be safe to come home?"</p><p>"Well... it could be a while." Akane said. "Listen."</p><p>Lia listened as her mother held the phone out from her ear. In the background Lia could hear what sounded like an older woman screaming and her father trying to calm her down. Putting the phone back Akane continued.</p><p>"Your father just told Nodoka about the side effects of being engaged to a ninja." she said.</p><p>Lia winced. "Oy."</p><p>"No kidding. You might want to check beforehand if Naotas coming over." Akane said as a crash could be heard in the background. "She didn't take the news well, and it'll take awhile before she changes her opinion of Naota."</p><p>Lia blinked as she listened to her mother. "What? She doesn't like him now?" she said.</p><p>"No, no, she's just high spirited, that's all. It'll just take a while to convince her." Akane said.</p><p>"Okay." Lia said with a nod. "Call this number when it's safe."</p><p>"I will." Akane said before she and Lia hung up.</p><p>Putting the phone back on its cradle Lia found Naota and Christian had flopped onto the couch and had the TV on. Stepping out of the kitchen Lia walked over to them and leaned on the back of the couch.</p><p>"You two are gonna watch TV?" Lia asked. "At nine in the morning?"</p><p>"Nah. I got a new game for my PS 4 that I wanna show Christian." Naota said. "It's multi player, if you an Mamimi wanna join in."</p><p>"Okay." Lia said as she looked at Mamimi, who nodded in agreement. "We're in."</p><p>"Good. There's a couple of extra controllers in my room, on top of my amp." Naota said as he began to flip through the menu on the game.</p><p>"Lets go Mamimi." Lia said as they walked over to Naotas door.</p><p>Naota and Christian both jumped as the girls screamed in terror at the sight of his room. Turning around he looked at them.</p><p>"I told you it was messy." he said.</p><p>Finally after seven pm Akane called and gave Lia the all clear. Standing on the porch she and Naota looked out over Nerima in the late afternoon sun.</p><p>"You know, next Monday school starts." Lia said.</p><p>Naota nodded. "Yeah."</p><p>"You ready for it?" Lia asked.</p><p>"I'll have to face it sooner or later Lia." Naota said with a shrug.</p><p>"That's one way to look at it." Lia said with a nod.</p><p>"Yeah. The only thing I have to worry about is someone slapping an ofuda(3) on my forehead." Naota said. "Someone's already tried that on me this week."</p><p>Lia gave Naota a deadpan look.</p><p>"You're kidding, right?" she asked.</p><p>"Nope." Naota answered with a shake of his head. "I made a run to the store and some girl form a shrine tried it when I was checking out."</p><p>"What'd you do?" Lia asked.</p><p>"I parried it with a pack of bologna." Naota said with a slight grin. "Then Mr. Hayabashi broomed her out of the store."</p><p>Lia chuckled as she stretched.</p><p>"Well, school sure is gonna be interesting." Lia said.</p><p>"Not that it was dull before." Naota said.</p><p>Lia nodded as she glanced at Naota.</p><p>"Well, we had better be heading home." she said. "I'll drop your duffle off tomorrow."</p><p>"Okay." Naota said. "You wanna spar on the roof from now on? I seriously doubt your grandmother will be looking there."</p><p>"Sure." Lia said with a nod. "Christian, Mamimi, lets go!" she called.</p><p>"See you tomorrow." Naota said as the two children stepped onto the deck.</p><p>"See you tomorrow." Lia answered as she picked up Mamimi and hopped onto the railing with Christian.</p><p>Stepping off the railing the three of them dropped to the grass below and then sped across to the next building. With ease they were on the roof s and bounded out of sight. Naota watched them go and then his stomach rumbled.</p><p>Turning he went inside in search of dinner.</p><p>1 Honshu is the main Japanese island that Tokyo is located on.</p><p>2 Saotome family term for when Christian has to be a girl all day. (I had another name in mind but it was taken.)</p><p>3 Demon repelling charm. Normally they're just slips of paper with kanji on them. Very dangerous if you're a demon.</p>
