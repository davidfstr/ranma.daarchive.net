</div><p>A badly wounded Akane  sinks into despair and catatonia, and nothing her friends do seems to  help.  Well, if her friends can't help,  maybe an enemy can.</p><p><u>Honorable Enemy</u></p><p>by Dan Stickney</p><p>Nabiki looked down at  the table, and sighed.</p><p>The normally calm,  cool, and collected Tendo sister was at the end of  her rope, barely two months after the disaster in the forest of Ryugenzawa.  Four  young martial artists had gone on a quest to quell the mighty Orochi and save the magic forest.  They'd faced the dragon, and by all accounts  they'd won, but the price had been far too high.  Her sister's fiancé Ranma, their friend  Ryoga, and some local kid that Nabiki had never heard of before had all died.  The only survivors had been her younger  sister Akane and the local kid's grandfather, and Akane's survival had  been...incomplete.  Her wounds had been  miraculously healed by the magic waters of the forest, but no magic could ever  restore what her younger sister had lost.</p><p>Akane hadn't spoken  since.  If anything, it was worse than  when their mother died.  Back then, Akane  had only stopped speaking for a month.   Now, she was virtually catatonic, eating little, saying nothing, waiting  to die.  Nothing her family and friends  had done seemed to help.  Even Nabiki,  with all of her resources, was at her wit's end.  All Nabiki could do was sit here and hope  desperately that somebody, somehow, would find a way to get through to  her.</p><p>It is a very  difficult thing to be only 16 years old and know that your life is over.</p><p>The dark-haired girl  lay in her bed and stared at the ceiling, ignoring the lunch that her oldest  sister had left on the nightstand beside her; just as she had ignored the  breakfast left there earlier, and the dinner the night before.  Dead people don't eat, after all.  So the girl just lay there, and strove to  make her mind as blank as possible.  For  that was the best way she knew to make the hurting go away.</p><p>It hurt to realize  that her life was over.  Everything she  had ever hoped for was impossible now.  Her  true love was gone.  Her future was gone.  All of her plans, hopes, and dreams – just gone.  It especially hurt to remember that barely a  month and a half ago she'd been immortal.   Well, not truly immortal, not in the literal sense of the word.  No, she'd only been immortal in the way only  teenagers seem to be.  After all, no 16  year old truly believes she can die.   Even this girl, who'd lost her own mother in childhood, had firmly  believed that somehow she'd always survive, always come out on top.</p><p>Too bad inexorable  fate knew different.</p><p>Maybe the worst part  was it had happened at her peak, struck down in the very moment of her  triumph.  For she'd never felt more alive  as she and her fiancé and friends, martial artists all, danced upon the razor's  edge of death battling the mighty Orochi.  But then the dragon's jaws had closed, and  her life had ended.</p><p>It was just her bad  luck that she'd survived the experience.</p><p>So now she lived this  half-life in bed.  Where nothing ever  happened, and nothing ever changed.  And nothing  ever would, ever again.</p><p>Today, however, was  going to be different.  A tall young  woman wearing a murderous expression and a bandolier of spatulas stormed  through the front door growling.   She  stomped right past the dark-haired girl's eldest sister, ignoring the tattered  remains of Kasumi's smile.  The middle  sister, Nabiki, looked up startled from where she slumped in the family room  before a sudden flash of insight led her to leap to her feet.  However, she didn't pursue the intruder.  Instead, she leaped at her older sister,  pinning her to the wall to prevent her from following as well.  Kasumi struggled briefly before she sagged to  her knees, surrendering to her sister and her tears.</p><p>The dark haired girl  looked but did not change expression when the tall young woman yanked open the shoji  and stormed into the room.  "How  DARE you throw away Ran-Chan's sacrifice like this, Akane!  Are you going to spend the rest of your life  hiding in your room?"</p><p>Akane returned her  gaze to the ceiling tiles.  As a matter  of fact, this wasn't her room.  Even the  small comfort of her own room had been denied to her, cut off forever by a  simple flight of stairs.   It was just  another thing that would hurt if she allowed herself to feel anything.</p><p>The tall young woman  strode over to the bed and grabbed Akane's chin, torquing  the prone girl's neck painfully so she could stare into her eyes.  "Don't you dare ignore me, either!  I don't care  what happened to you, you have no right to act this way!"</p><p>Distant fire seemed  to explode in Akane's mind, but she ignored it.   Feelings were for the living.   Still, she couldn't help but respond.   "What do you care about me, Ukyo?"</p><p>Ukyo slapped her,  hard.  "God damn you!  You cost me everything!  He threw his life away to save yours, AND YOU'RE  NOT WORTHY OF HIM!"</p><p>A familiar, but long  absent, feeling began coursing through Akane:   Anger.  "Ukyo, are you  blind?  I'm not worthy of anyone any  more!"</p><p>"Any  more?"  The taller girl sneered.  "You were never worthy of him in the  first place, coward."</p><p>Akane's anger began  to break through her carefully cultivated indifference.  "What did you say?"</p><p>"What, have you gone deaf, too?  I said you were never worthy of him in the  first place, you sniveling, cowardly little brat.  Little Miss 'poor poor pitiful me' Akane, who  never got over losing her mommy.  The psychological cripple.   You should be grateful now that your outside  matches your insides!" Akane flinched at every sentence, like it was a  physical blow, but Ukyo didn't seem to care, or even notice.  Instead, she went right on with her  ranting.  "What about me?  He died for you, and now my honor will never  be redeemed.  I loved him, but he never  loved me back!  He wasted his love on you  instead!     And you, you...you treated  that love like it was dirt!  How dare  you!  How dare you take what was  rightfully mine and treat it like dirt!"</p><p>Out in the hallway,  Kasumi struggled to break away from Nabiki's grasp,  but Nabiki wouldn't let go.  "Oneechan, no!"  She whispered desperately.  "Nothing else has pulled her out of  it!"</p><p>"Wasted..."  Akane began to tremble; bewildered by this  assault from someone she'd thought a friend.  Other suppressed emotions were threatening to  breach the wall that had been weakened by her anger.  "But... I'm..."</p><p>Ukyo cut her  off.  "Oh, what the hell do you  want, sympathy?  You got what you  deserved.  At least this way you won't  lead anyone else to their death by pretending to be a <u>real</u> martial  artist."</p><p>"Pre-pretending?" Akane's rage broke through.  "Get out, Kuonji.  Or I swear I'll kill you."</p><p>The taller girl was  having none of it.  "Come and get  me, CRIPPLE!"</p><p>A killing rage swept  through Akane.  She threw herself at the  taller girl, screaming.  Years of  carefully honed reflexes kicked in as she leaped to her feet... feet she no  longer had.  Instead, she tumbled  headfirst out of bed at the other girl's feet, the stumps of her severed legs  waving uselessly in the air.</p><p>The sound of Akane  crashing to the floor proved to be too much for Kasumi to take.  She threw off Nabiki and rushed up the  hallway, stopping in shock at the sight of her poor, injured little sister  sobbing in helpless rage at the intruder's feet.</p><p>Kasumi elbowed Ukyo  aside and dropped to her knees next to Akane, desperately seeking to comfort  the distraught girl, but Akane was thrashing too hard for Kasumi to hold  her.  "Get OUT Kuonji!  GET OUT!"  She screamed.   "I swear on Ranma's grave I'll kill you for this!"  Finally, she broke down, weeping helplessly</p><p>Ukyo swallowed,  hoping that no one would notice the expression in her eyes.  "Yeah, sure you will.  Any time you want to try, you know where to  find me."  She turned and stalked  back out the way she came.  She didn't  even glance at Nabiki on her way out.</p><p>Nabiki just stood there in the hallway staring  at the door for a long time after Ukyo had left, while her little sister  finally cried the tears that she'd been unable to shed at the hospital, or the  funeral.</p><p>A passerby noticed  the young woman weeping outside the Tendo's gate and  shook her head as she went on her way.  How  much tragedy could one family be expected to take?</p><p>Akane's physical  therapist handed a cup of tea to Kasumi as they waited for her younger sister  to finish her exercises.  "Er, I can't help noticing that your sister has had a real change  in attitude this week,"  he offered,  even though he knew that calling Akane's shift from near catatonia to grim  determination "a change in attitude" was a serious understatement.</p><p>Kasumi pursed her  lips.  "We had a visitor on Monday."</p><p>The therapist waited,  but Kasumi didn't seem eager to elaborate any further.  "Ah... was it a friend?" He  prompted finally.</p><p>"I used to think  so...but I'm not so sure any more.  She  said some terrible things to Akane.   Called her a coward, and a cripple, and said that she wasn't worthy of  her fiance's love or sacrifice.  Akane took it very badly, but then she got  very angry."  Kasumi looked down at  her tea.  "I never thought I'd  actually be happy to see my hotheaded sister get angry."</p><p>The Doctor looked  across the room to where Akane was working a weight machine hard enough to  threaten its structural integrity.   "Hmmm..."</p><p>Kasumi swung her bag  jauntily as the three Tendo sisters made their way  home to the dojo, exhilarated by their latest victory.  It hadn't been easy getting to the neighborhood  market district; curb cuts tend to be few and far between in a society that considers  weakness dishonorable and disability shameful.   Still, Akane had managed it with the help of her sisters.  Once there, the neighborhood merchants had  seemed genuinely happy to see her. And why not?  Most of them had known her all of her life.  Best of all, Akane was actually smiling a  little!  Kasumi would have been thrilled  if her sister had only looked a little less grim.</p><p>Akane nodded her head  in satisfaction as she wheeled herself along.   Sure it had been hard, but what of her battles hadn't been.  She still didn't like many of the looks she  was getting, but so what.  For the first  time, she was beginning to realize that this was something she could live  with.  Her musings were cut short by a  familiar voice.</p><p>"So, Akane…  I see you finally came out of your little  hidey-hole."</p><p>The short haired girl  stopped pushing and let herself roll to a stop.   "What do you want, Ukyo?"</p><p>"Oh,  nothing."  Sun glinted of Ukyo's battle spatula as she  stepped out of the shadows to block Akane's path. "Just doing  my morning shopping.  I'm kinda surprised you finally worked up the guts to come out  of hiding.  It certainly took you long  enough."</p><p>Akane gritted her  teeth.  "Well, I figure it's still my  neighborhood."  She smiled grimly at the  chef.  "Who knows?  Some day I might even make it to the U-chan."</p><p>Ukyo matched Akane's predatory  smile.  "Wouldn't do you much good,  Sugar, I don't think you'd be able to make it inside."</p><p>"Maybe I should sue."</p><p>Ukyo snorted  derisively.  "This ain't  America, Akane.  In this country you  don't get any special civil rights with your wheelchair."</p><p>Akane fought her  rising temper.  "Bet I could get in there  anyway, if I really wanted to."</p><p>Ukyo looked her up  and down carefully.  "A real bet?  Or are you just mouthing off?"</p><p>Akane sneered back at  her.  "What do you mean a real bet?"</p><p>"OK, Sugar, I'll make  you a bet.  If you can get your sawed off little ass…"   Kasumi gasped, but Ukyo ignored her "…into one of my booths, I'll give  you anything you want, on the house.   What do you say?"</p><p>"It's a deal, Kuonji.  Now get out  of my way."</p><p>Ukyo stepped aside  and let the three sisters pass.  Nabiki  gave her a measuring look that she didn't seem to notice.  Kasumi was fuming as they headed up the  street.  "The nerve of that  girl, talking to you that way."</p><p>Akane looked grim and  determined.  "Don't worry, sis.  I'll show her.  You just wait."</p><p>None of them looked  back.  If they had, they might have  noticed Ukyo leaning heavily against a lamppost, one hand pressed over her  eyes.</p><p>Akane paused to catch  her breath.  Odd how a new perspective  can change your view of life, she thought.   After all, six months ago, who would have guessed that Akane Tendo the world-class jock-chick and all-around tomboy  would ever come to hate physical education class as much as she did now?  Though, to be truthful, Akane didn't hate PE  out of some newfound distaste for exercise.   These days, Akane was, if anything, exercising more than ever in order  to strengthen the arms that now had to serve double duty.  No, Akane hated PE because it served as a  daily slap-in-the face reminder of what she had lost.  At least in her other classes everyone else  had to sit down, too.  Each class became  a one-hour block where she could at least pretend to be normal.  PE allowed her no such illusions, because she  could no longer participate with the others.   Everyone else did physical education while she was stuck doing physical  therapy, and she hated being singled out for her injuries.</p><p>In short, Akane hated  PE because it was the only class that forced her to confront being crippled.</p><p>Akane shook her head  and grimly returned her mind to the task at hand, which was humiliatingly  simple:  walking.  She gritted her teeth and took a better grip  on the parallel bars.  This new use for  the school's gymnastic equipment was just another aspect of her humiliation, to  her mind.  Once she'd been able to make  this equipment sing, or at least groan, anyway.   Well, she'd show them.  She'd show  them all - especially a certain kansai hick-bitch restaurateur.</p><p>Lift,  twist, step.  Lift, twist, step.  In theory, it sounded so simple.  In reality, it was agonizing, as her  shoulders, back, and hips were forced to do the work of missing ankles and  knees.  Still, it wasn't complicated, and  she was finally starting to get the rhythm as she inched along, shuffling the  three-meter length of the bars twenty centimeters at a time.</p><p>Suddenly, one of the  feet (she still couldn't quite think of them as 'hers') caught and she almost  went down, barely catching herself by throwing her arm over the bar.  She imagined that this would probably be much  easier with a pair of those high-tech electronic inertial knee joints coming  out of America.  Unfortunately, her  family could never afford something like that - those legs cost millions of  Yen.  Akane had to make due with the much  simpler prostheses she got from the government, even though the very thought of  being dependent upon those sanctimonious welfare bureaucrats set her teeth on  edge.</p><p>Akane heaved herself  back up and tried again.  At least the  government-issue legs had flexible Jaipur feet and  suction sockets that eliminated the need for any harness above the waist.  Akane blew out her breath in  frustration.    <i>Shit, listen to  me.  'Jaipur  feet',' inertial knees', 'suction socket'; I've become a goddamned expert in a  subject I never wanted to know anything about.</i>  At least she didn't have to wear those damned  uncomfortable bloomers any more.  Even  the sexist pig school administrators who insisted on that stupid PE uniform  found all of the harness hardware and doll-pink plastic they exposed  distasteful, so Akane got to wear sweatpants instead.  True, that was a very slim silver lining in a  huge dark cloud, but at least it was something.   These days, Akane was willing to take anything she could get.</p><p>Akane missed another  step and toppled forward, but this time she missed the bar with her elbow and  barely caught herself before she hit the floor.   As she hung there panting, Akane wished, briefly and irrationally, that  the Orochi's teeth had taken her legs off below the  knees instead of mid-thigh.  Now <u>that</u>  was pretty idiotic, when you thought about it.   As long as she was wishing, she might as well wish that the dragon  hadn't bitten through her legs at all.   One wish was just as good as the other, for all the good wishing would  do.  Hell, even if she ever did get a  wish, she'd wish to have her friends restored to life before she'd even think  of wishing to get her legs back.  As a  matter of fact, if a kami showed up this very moment and told her that she  could give up her arms to get Ranma back, she'd agree in an instant, and  happily spend the rest of her life in a basket.   <i>Ranma</i>... Akane lowered her head, and allowed one hot tear to leak  out.</p><p>"Giving up  already, Akane?  I thought you were  supposed to be tough."  The  familiar, hated voice cut through her sorrow like a speedboat cutting across a  lake, leaving rage in its wake.  Akane  looked up, lips curling into a snarl.   Ukyo was standing at the other end of the bars, sneering as usual.  The parallel bars groaned in protest as Akane  wrenched herself back upright, heedless of the way her  shoulder muscles screamed from the abuse.   She dragged herself towards her hated enemy bent on vengeance, never  even noticing that she was now covering 50 to 60 centimeters with each  stride.  Finally, she reached the end of  the bars and drew back her right fist, but her left arm wasn't able to support  her anymore, and she found herself collapsing into Ukyo's arms instead, shaking  with exhaustion, rage and humiliation.</p><p>"Not bad,  sugar."  Ukyo purred  condescendingly.  "But you're gonna have to do a lot better than that if you expect to  win our little bet."  Despite her  scathing tone, she carefully propped the gasping Akane up until Nabiki and her  therapist could come to her rescue, and didn't let go until she was sure the  disabled girl could stand on her own.</p><p>Akane didn't even  seem to notice; instead, she threw off Ukyo's hands as soon as she could.  "I'll make you eat those words, Kuonji."  She gasped out between great, sobbing  breaths.  "Just you wait."</p><p>Ukyo smiled  nastily.  "Don't keep me waiting too  long, hon." Nabiki glared at Ukyo as she helped Akane into her wheelchair,  but the tall girl didn't seem to notice.   Ukyo stood by the parallel bars until she saw the others disappear into  the locker room before she turned and sprinted for the bathroom.</p><p>Akane aimed her racing  chair down the street, hoping to shave another minute off her time.  Ironically, that was nearly five minutes  faster then her best time running this same loop.  Runners can't build momentum and coast, after  all.  Fortunately for her, the warren of narrow  alleyways that made up the heart of the Nerima ward was almost empty of cars  and entirely devoid of sidewalks.  Once  she'd made it into the street proper, all she had to contend with was the  bicycles, and she had little trouble keeping pace with them.  Her first few trips had earned her quite a  few odd looks, but by now most passersby found her presence unremarkable.  In fact, anyone who did find her presence objectionable  was not likely to find a sympathetic ear in this neighborhood:  Disabled or not, Akane Tendo  was a local girl, and outsiders could keep their goddamned opinions to  themselves.</p><p>Unfortunately, not everyone  was of the same mind.  Some people,  particularly among the elderly, still hadn't accepted her.  Akane could still recall the horror she'd  felt when old Mrs. Yamada, a neighbor who'd   known the Tendo girls from birth, had casually  asked her why she hadn't killed herself to eliminate the burden she placed on  her family.  Kasumi had been beside  herself from the cruel thoughtlessness of the remark, and none of them had  spoken with Mrs. Yamada since.  None of  them had ever dreamed that she'd felt that way, but surely she wasn't the only  one who held such sentiments:  She was  just the only one clueless enough to express herself openly.  Maybe in the long run, though, it had actually  been a good thing, because it completely obliterated any thoughts Akane may  have had of actually doing such a thing.   There was just no way she'd ever give the old harridan the pleasure.</p><p>Akane grimaced.  <i>You just never knew about some people</i>.   That was one thing about acquiring a  disability – it really showed you who your true friends were. Take this very  expensive wheelchair for example.  Nabiki  wouldn't say where it came from, but Akane suspected there was Kuno money behind it.   Kuno himself was uncharacteristically silent  about it too, for once forgoing his habitual boasting about his nobility –  perhaps because his first truly noble act spoke for itself.  As a matter of fact, the 'Blue Thunder' was  actually treating her with respectful formality these days, and who would have  expected that?  Of course the fact that the  obsessive kendoist had finally dropped his suit for  her hand said ugly things about her future romantic prospects, but Akane would  rather be the object of his respect than his obsession any day.</p><p>As for her other  friends, again, the result wasn't what she would have predicted.  <i>Shampoo can barely disguise the terror in  her eyes every time she looks at me.</i>   Though, truth be told, she didn't fear Akane herself so much as she  feared the example of human fragility that Akane represented.  Akane was a living reminder that even the  best martial artists could be overmatched, destroyed…dismembered.  Shampoo couldn't look at her without seeing  her own worst nightmares made flesh.  Yuka,  on the other hand, was afraid of herself; so terrified that she'd say the wrong  thing that she locked up rigid every time Akane so much as came near her.  Most of her other classmates seemed to suffer  from something similar to different degrees.   In fact, of all her friends, only Sayuri  seemed to be unaffected by Akane's disabilities:  Unfortunately, her overprotective mother had  forbidden her from associating with Akane outside of school.  <i>Damn it, it's not like traumatic  amputation is contagious.</i></p><p>Unfortunately,  thoughts of her friends could only lead to one in particular:  Ukyo, though 'friend' probably wasn't an  appropriate term for her anymore.   Even though she'd once been the friendliest of  Ranma's various fiancées their relationship had been steadily deteriorating  lately.  The tall chef was still obsessively  persecuting Akane over Ranma's death.   Though obsessive was perhaps the best description for the chef,  considering how she'd doggedly pursued Ranma for over a decade seeking first  vengeance, and then matrimony.   Ukyo  seemed to take Akane's survival as a personal affront.  Forgiveness didn't seem likely in this life,  or the next.</p><p>Inevitably, thinking  about Ukyo led Akane to the thoughts about the source of the girl's anger:  Ranma.   Akane's tears flowed generously, even though her arms didn't falter in  their relentless rhythm.  It took losing  Ranma to make Akane realize how much she'd come to care about him, and how much  her stupid pride had cost her.  She  hadn't realized what she'd had until she'd lost it.  And she hadn't just lost Ranma either, she'd  lost Ryoga and Shinnosuke too; the three boys she'd  cared about most gone in an instant.  It just  wasn't fair.  Still, as much as Akane had  come to despise Ukyo, she had to admit that the kansai  girl was right about one thing:  She  wasn't about to throw away their sacrifice now.</p><p>Ukyo took another  swig from the antacid bottle, but it didn't seem to help any.</p><p>She grimaced as she  placed the half empty bottle back on her desk.   Lately, she'd been drinking the stuff like soda, but it no longer served  to extinguish the fire in her guts.  She  shook her head.  She'd anticipated many  of the problems she faced when she set out on this course, but permanent  indigestion wasn't one of them.</p><p>Nor was the problem  that glared back at her from the ledgers on her desk.  She'd expected business to drop off as her  behavior alienated her classmates, but she never realized that it would drop  off this much.  Obviously, there was a  whisper campaign going on against Ucchan's.  Not only that, but recently her suppliers had  started jacking their prices as well.   Ukyo didn't even have to think twice to know who was responsible - it  had to be Nabiki.   Apparently, the ice  queen really did care about her little sister.   Who would have thought?</p><p>Ukyo shook her  head.  Her doom was written in the  numbers.  She'd be bankrupt by the end of  the month.  Everything she'd worked for  would be gone.  She tried to tell herself  that she didn't care, and nearly succeeded - but not quite.  It hurt to see her life's work go down the  drain, wasted.</p><p>No, not wasted -  expended.  There was a difference.   For her life's work had always been  predicated on sharing her future with Ranma.   Without Ranma, she had no future, and no more need for her life's  work.  Viewed that way, her business and  reputation became nothing more than ammunition, mere assets to be expended in  this, her final campaign.</p><p>She pushed back from  the desk and staggered off towards her bedroom, unconsciously rubbing her  stomach.  Well, if this was her final campaign,  then she had to wrap it up soon.  She had  less than one month to do whatever she could to ensure that Ran-Chan's final  sacrifice hadn't been in vain.</p><p>As she reached for  the light switch, she suddenly understood the fatalism that allowed someone to  pilot a kamikaze mission.  If you're  going to die anyway, you might as well make your life count for something.  Suicide isn't a sacrifice if death is  inevitable.  The Kamikaze pilots knew  that they were going to be shot down.    Crashing the airplane into a ship merely ensured that their inevitable  death wasn't wasted.</p><p>Well, Ukyo's mission  wasn't death, it was life, and her death wasn't inevitable.  But just like those old kamikaze pilots, she  was intent on completing her mission, whatever the cost.  She had no intention of committing suicide,  but she didn't particularly care if she survived, either.</p><p>Click scuff-scuff,  Click scuff-scuff.</p><p>Akane made her way  across the lower athletic field towards the school, her crutches and artificial  feet making an easy rhythm.  Re-learning  how to walk had been the toughest thing she'd ever done, but these days she was  glad she'd stuck with it.  What it cost  her in effort it more than made up for in improved mobility.  It was so nice not to be stuck a head below  every conversation, too.</p><p>She couldn't help  smiling a little as she swung herself along, headed back from softball  practice.  She'd been shocked when her  old teammates asked their former star pitcher to become team manager and  scorekeeper.   She'd been very reluctant  at first, not wanting to be reminded that she could no longer play  herself.  She'd imagined that the very  thought of being permanently benched would be unbearable.  Still, she'd finally given in the gentle  pressure from her teammates, and now she was glad she did.</p><p>Not that she'd ever  admit it, but the openly expressed doubts that a certain obnoxious okonomiyaki chef had raised about her ability to handle the  job had influenced her decision as well.</p><p>Sure, she couldn't  play any more, but it was nice to be part of the team again.  It didn't hurt that the Coach had come to  rely on her as a strategist and a pitching coach.  Nice as it was, though, it was still quite a  comedown for a girl who had once hammered many homers.  Hell, even Ranma had respected her skills,  after she'd nailed him with that foul ball...</p><p><i>Ranma</i>...  The steady rhythm of her crutches faltered.   It still hurt to think about Ranma, but at least the very thought of him  no longer brought heartrending, paralyzing pain.  Over the months that pain had faded to a  dull, persistent ache.  Sometime soon,  Akane realized, she'd be able to move on with her life.  She just wasn't ready yet.</p><p>It wasn't being  unfaithful, wasn't it?  Ranma had wanted  her to live, after all.  Surely he hadn't  died expecting her to spend the rest of her days in some perpetual half-life of  mourning.  At least that's what her  doctors kept telling her.  Maybe someday  soon she'd believe it herself.</p><p>Akane's meditations  came to an end as she reached the steep bank separating the lower and upper  athletic fields.  Once she could have  cleared it in one or two leaps.  Now she'd  have to detour around, or make her slow and painful way up the stairs, one step  at a time.  It was an ugly reminder that  there were some aspects of her disability that she would probably never  overcome.  She sagged a little and a  heavy sigh escaped her.</p><p>"Quitting again,  Akane?"  No taunts followed that  opening gibe, but by this time none were necessary.  The mere sound of that familiar, hateful  voice was enough.  Akane gritted her  teeth and attacked the bank, growling all along.  Students all around the athletic field looked  on in awe as the teenager threw herself into a task  that her most optimistic therapist would have considered impossible.</p><p>Akane didn't care if it  was possible or not, so intent she was on reaching that mocking voice and  silencing it.  Her crutches creaked  dangerously, subjected to a much higher load than any reasonable engineer could  ever have anticipated, but she ignored that, just as she ignored the slip that  nearly resulted in a serious fall, ignored the complaints of her arms and  shoulders, ignored everything except her determination to get to the  brown-haired girl and make her suffer.   She surged over the top of the bank and threw herself at the taller  girl, snarling...</p><p>Ukyo didn't even bother  to raise her hands or even change expression.   She merely took one step backwards and allowed the smaller girl to  sprawl at her feet.  Then she squatted  down.  "Good work, Akane.  I knew you could do it - with a little  motivation."</p><p>Akane lay gasping on  the ground, exhausted from her climb.   "I'll make you pay for that, Kuonji!   Just you wait!"  She tried to  lever herself up, and failed.</p><p>Ukyo patted her  shoulder condescendingly.  "Don't strain  yourself on my account, sugar."  She  stood up and turned to leave.</p><p>Akane growled and  rolled over onto her back, the first step in the laborious process of regaining  her feet.  "Come back here, Ukyo!  I'm not finished with you yet!"</p><p>The taller girl  didn't even bother turning around.   "Sorry Akane, I've got to get home for the dinner rush.  If you want something, you know where to find  me."</p><p>"Yeah."  Akane  growled, knowing that Ukyo would be long gone well before she could get to her  feet again.  That didn't stop her from  trying, though.</p><p><i>Wonder</i> <i>how bad business will be this Sunday.</i>  Ukyo thought as she unrolled her shop curtain.    Like Ukyo itself, it had seen better days, but Ukyo had no money to  replace it with.  Not that there was any  point in replacing it, since there wasn't enough money to make Monday's rent  payment, either.</p><p>"Hey  Ukyo!"</p><p>"Akane?"  Ukyo  carefully wiped the grin off of her face before turning around.  She'd noticed something that she hadn't heard  in Akane's voice in months-confidence.</p><p>"I've come to  collect, Kuonji."</p><p>Ukyo looked down at  the girl in the wheelchair.  "I  don't see how.  You know you'll never be  able to get into my place in that thing."</p><p>Akane threw back her  head and laughed.  "I'm not here to  collect on our bet.  I'm here to collect  on my promise."</p><p>Ukyo looked honestly  puzzled.  "Which promise was  that?"</p><p>Akane gritted her  teeth.  "My  promise to make you pay, bitch."</p><p>Suddenly, Akane threw  herself forward out of her wheelchair into a headfirst dive and roll.  Ukyo spent a brief instant wondering if the  other girl had taken leave of her senses when she felt Akane's hand close in a  vise-like grip around her left ankle.   Using her free hand and the stumps of her legs for leverage, Akane  easily yanked the taller girl off of her feet.   As she fell backwards, Ukyo felt a brief flash of exhilaration followed  by two horrible realizations:  First,  Akane's arms had been as strong as a gorilla's <u>before</u> she'd spent six  months pushing herself around in a wheelchair.  Second, once Ukyo was on the ground, all of  her own speed and mobility advantages would be negated.  On the ground, Akane held all of the  cards.  Unable to break her fall  effectively, Ukyo slammed to the ground, landing flat on her back and hitting  her head on the pavement.  She thrashed  in a desperate attempt to get away, but she couldn't break Akane's iron  grip.  Ukyo's world became very painful  for a few minutes before it became very black.</p><p>Ukyo's eventual  return to consciousness was a decidedly mixed blessing.</p><p>"How do you  feel?"</p><p>"Like  I've been hit by a truck."  If anything, that was an understatement.  Akane had somehow managed to refrain from  inflicting any permanent or crippling injuries, but that hadn't stopped her  from giving the object of her hatred a thorough and professional working  over.  The entire surface of Ukyo's body  felt like one massive, continuous bruise.   Ukyo blinked a few times, trying to get her eyes to focus, before she  looked over at her interrogator.  She was  surprised to see Nabiki Tendo sitting there.  She didn't look particularly sympathetic, but  then again, Nabiki never did.</p><p>"You'll probably  be glad to know that the doctors were able to fix the detached retina without  any problems."  Nabiki said in the  sort of conversational tones that most people would use to comment on the  weather.</p><p>Ukyo raised her hand  and found a bandage covering her right eye.   "Really?   I hadn't noticed."  Suddenly,  the constant pain in her gut contracted in one massive, horrible cramp, and she  turned away from Nabiki to vomit over the other side of the bed, into the  bucket that had been placed there for the purpose.</p><p>Nabiki waited calmly  for Ukyo to stop puking.  Growing up in a  Dojo, she'd had enough experience with concussed people to know that nausea  often accompanied their return to consciousness.  And in her opinion, the Kuonji  girl deserved all the suffering she could get.   Had she bothered to look, though, she might have noticed that Ukyo's  vomit was disturbingly red, stained with the bright crimson of arterial blood.</p><p>Ukyo's stomach  stopped heaving, and rolled back over, blood from her split lips and loosened  teeth smearing the lower half of her face.   Nabiki did not offer her a tissue.   Ukyo lay back on the pillow and took a few deep breaths, trying to pull  herself back together.  "Why are you  here, Nabiki?"</p><p>"I want to know  if you're going to file charges against my sister."</p><p>Ukyo's lips puffed  out in bitter, silent laughter.  "Yeah, right.  Like I could possibly convince a court that a girl in wheelchair  beat the hell out of a trained martial artist."</p><p>Nabiki hadn't lost  her cool, hard expression.  "There  were witnesses."</p><p>Ukyo closed her eyes.  The aching in her gut was agonizing.  She  wished she had her antacid bottle, even though the stuff didn't seem to be  working anymore.  "You talk as if  there were anyone on this planet who would testify on my behalf."  Suddenly, she felt dizzy, cold, and very  tired.  Her voice dropped to a mumbling  whisper.  "I knew this would be  hard, but I never dreamed that it would cost me everything."</p><p>Nabiki didn't know  what to make of that statement.   "What did you say?"</p><p>Ukyo ignored her.  "At least I can rest now..." she murmured as  the room seemed to fade out around her. As she lost consciousness her last  thoughts were a profound wish that someone would come and turn off that damned  alarm...</p><p>Nabiki drifted back  down the hallway in a daze, barely noticing the doctors and nurses running in  the opposite direction.  The righteous  anger at her former friend that had been driving her was gone, replaced by a  horrible nagging doubt that she, of all people, had misread this situation  badly.</p><p>"Nabiki?"</p><p>Nabiki looked down  into her sisters' expectant faces.  She'd  finally wandered into the waiting area.   Kasumi blinked up at her, confused by the sudden change in her younger  sister's demeanor.  "Nabiki?"  She repeated.   "Nabiki, what's wrong?"</p><p>It took a second for  Nabiki to find her voice.  "I... I  think Ukyo's gone."</p><p>"Figures."  Akane growled, fiddling with the fingerless biking gloves she wore to  protect her palms and fidgeting in her wheelchair.  "Probably snuck out  the back or something."</p><p>Nabiki shook her head  and sagged onto the couch next to Kasumi.   "No Akane, she hasn't left the hospital.  She's <i>gone</i>.  I think her heart may have stopped while I  was talking to her.  All the machines  went crazy, all at once.  They're trying  to resuscitate her, now."</p><p>That took everyone  aback.  Much as they'd come to despise  the hateful young woman, none of them had really wanted her to die.  Akane looked stricken.  "I killed her, didn't I?"</p><p>Kasumi considered  Nabiki very carefully, surprised to see that she looked shaken to the  core.  Nabiki hadn't earned her stoic  reputation for nothing, after all.   "There's something else, isn't there."</p><p>Nabiki swallowed and  looked up.  "Her last words  were:  'I can rest now, Akane doesn't  need me any more.'"</p><p>"Excuse me; are  you here for Miss Kuonji?"</p><p>Nabiki scrubbed her  hands across her eyes and looked up at the man in green surgical garb.  "Yes.  Is she going to make  it?"</p><p>"I think so, but  I can't promise anything.  It was touch  and go for a while, but I think she'll pull through. Are you family or  friends?"</p><p>Nabiki grimaced.  "Neither.  She doesn't have any family…or any friends  for that matter."</p><p>"I see, I  think."  The Doctor looked puzzled.  "Then why are you here?"</p><p>Akane spoke up  quietly.  "I'm the one who beat her  up."</p><p>The Doctor looked  over at the young woman in the wheelchair and did a double take.  "You?"</p><p>Akane looked up at  him crossly.  "I <u>am</u> a martial  artist, I'll have you know."</p><p>The doctor  shrugged.  "I believe you.  Miss Kuonji's  injuries speak for themselves."  He  looked around the three women.   "That doesn't explain why you're here."</p><p>Akane wet her  lips.  "We were friends once, and we  both loved the same boy.  He died in the  same... um, incident that cost me my legs."  He'd probably assume it was a car accident,  but Akane didn't care to explain about the dragon just now.  It didn't matter anyway.  Akane looked at the floor where her feet  would have been, had she still had them.   "She's blamed me ever since."</p><p>The doctor winced in  sympathy.  In this profession, you saw a  lot of that sort of thing.</p><p>Akane looked up, a  haunted look in her eyes.  "Did I do  this to her?  Was it something I  did?"</p><p>The doctor smiled his  best reassuring smile.  "No, it  wasn't.  I fact, you might even say that  you saved her life."</p><p>Akane blinked in  confusion.  "What do you mean?"</p><p>Ukyo lay in her  hospital bed and stared at the ceiling tiles, mind blank, eyes unfocussed.  They'd told her that the bandage would be  coming off of her eye tomorrow, but she wasn't thinking about that - or  anything else, for that matter.  It hurt  too much to think. The irony of the situation didn't escape her, but she was  too tired, too hurt, to care anymore.  <i>This  must be how Akane felt.</i></p><p>They'd done emergency  abdominal surgery, expecting to find her spleen ruptured from the beating.  Instead, they found a massive perforated  ulcer.  No one died from ulcers, did  they?  She'd said as much to her doctor,  and he'd replied that a bleeding hole was a bleeding hole, regardless of  whether it was on the inside or the outside.   First she'd almost died from the blood loss - they'd had to restart her  heart twice on the operating table.  Then  she'd needed massive antibiotic therapy and multiple transfusions to combat the  raging case of peritonitis that almost claimed her afterwards.  Perhaps the biggest irony of all was she  wouldn't have stood a snowball's chance if she hadn't been in the hospital  already.  Akane had actually saved her  life by beating her into unconsciousness.   He'd told her, in all honesty, that she was very lucky to be alive.</p><p>Lucky.  Hell, she'd  have been luckier if she'd died.  No one  had come to visit her, and no one would.   She'd lost everything.  She had no  family, no friends, no honor, and no future.   Her restaurant and all of her personal possessions would be auctioned to  cover her medical bills, and there wasn't anything she could do about it. She  didn't even own the clothes on her back.   Her whole life was gone, expended in her quest to help a girl who hated  her.</p><p>Gradually, she became  aware that someone was calling her nickname, softly, as if from a great  distance.  "Ran-Chan?"  Her one working eye gradually focused on a  figure sitting beside her bed.  It wasn't  Ran-Chan.</p><p>"Ucchan?"  Nabiki reached over and took Ukyo's hand,  squeezing gently as the injured girl slowly returned from her state of near  catatonia.  The lost, unfocussed look on  the young chef's face reminded her uncomfortably of her own sister's expression  barely six months earlier.  She still  didn't like this girl much.  Entirely too  much ugliness had passed between them to be immediately forgiven.  Still, she had to try to reach her, because  if she didn't, no one else would.  And  only Ukyo could answer Nabiki's nagging questions.</p><p>"Ran-chan?"  Ukyo muttered, her uninjured eye focusing at  last.  Then she blinked once,  slowly.  "What are you doing here,  Nabiki?"</p><p>Nabiki felt a  horrible sense of deja-vu.  Ukyo had said almost the exact same thing the  last time.   "I have to ask you  something, Ukyo."</p><p>Ukyo closed her  eyes.  "I told you that I wasn't  going to file any charges, Nabiki.  Now  please go away."</p><p>"Ukyo, what did  you mean when you said Akane didn't need you any more?"</p><p>Ukyo jerked like  she'd been slapped.  "Did I say  that?  I must have been delirious or  something."</p><p>Nabiki growled and  leaned closer.  "Don't you dare try  to deny it, Kuonji.  You said it, and I  heard it.  I have to know.  Now give."</p><p>Ukyo looked into Nabiki's strained face.   She'd sworn that she'd take this secret to her grave, but the sudden  urge to tell somebody, anybody, was just too strong.  "Swear to me on your honor that you will  never, ever tell Akane about this."</p><p>Nabiki leaned  back.  "Who are you to speak of  honor?"</p><p>Ukyo blew out her breath.  "Nabiki, I know more about honor than  you ever will.  I have been dishonored,  and Ranma's death means my honor can never be redeemed.  Now swear."</p><p>Nabiki looked like  she would have rather chewed rocks.   "I swear."</p><p>Ukyo sagged back onto  her pillow and looked back at the ceiling.   "When Ran-Chan died, I realized that my honor could never be  redeemed. My life was over.  But his last  job wasn't finished yet.   So I swore on  his grave that I would not allow his sacrifice to be in vain."</p><p>Nabiki looked puzzled.  "What's that supposed to mean?"</p><p>Ukyo looked back at  Nabiki.  "He gave his life for  Akane's, and you were going to stand back and let her throw that life  away."</p><p>Nabiki's face colored.   "How dare you even suggest that!"</p><p>Suddenly, Ukyo was  angry too.  "Damn you, do you think  I was just going to stand by and let her die?   Somebody had to give her the will to live."</p><p>Nabiki  swallowed.  "That's what I thought  you were doing the first time.  But you  didn't stop.  You kept hounding  her."</p><p>Ukyo lay back and  stared at the ceiling again, her anger spent.   "I just couldn't bear to watch you and Kasumi baby Akane until she  turned into a helpless cripple."</p><p>Nabiki felt like  she'd been kicked in the gut.  "But  she's my baby sister.  What the hell else  was I supposed to do?"</p><p>Ukyo felt herself  slipping back into the distance.  "I  don't know. You love her; you wanted to protect her.  But Akane is a warrior.  She needed something to fight, a focus for  her spirit.  I figured I could give her  that.  If you couldn't convince her to  fight for herself, then maybe I could convince her to fight against me. What  did I have left to lose?  No one would  miss a dishonored Okonomiyaki vendor."  She took a deep breath.  "Besides, it gave me something to live  for, too."</p><p>Nabiki felt  sick.  She'd expected something like  this.  Still, it hurt to hear it.  "I hope you didn't expect us to thank  you for this."</p><p>Ukyo's voice had sunk  back to a monotone.  "No, I expected  you to hate me."  She started losing  herself in the random patterns of dots on the ceiling again.  "Anyway, it's over now.  I'm all done."</p><p>Nabiki had the  uncomfortable feeling that Ukyo wasn't just referring to her vendetta against  Akane.  Ukyo was slipping away  again.  She cudgeled her brain  desperately, trying to come up with something, anything, to keep the young  woman talking.  "Ukyo...why?"</p><p>"Who must do the  difficult thing?  One who can."  Ukyo  quoted softly.  "I just never  expected it to hurt this much..."   Her voice trailed off and her eyes unfocussed.</p><p>"That's not what  I meant, Ukyo.  Why don't you want me to  tell Akane?"</p><p>The response was  little more than a sigh.  "She needs  her anger to keep her going.  Better to  be an honorable enemy than a dishonorable friend."</p><p>Nabiki  swallowed.  "Ucchan,  don't go.  We won't hate you, I promise.  Just come back to us, please?"</p><p>There was no  response.</p><p>"Damn it Ukyo,  you're doing the exact same thing Akane was!   You're throwing your life away too!   Don't you understand that?  Ukyo?"</p><p>Ukyo drifted back  into nothingness.  Nabiki was droning something  that she paid no attention to.  It was so  nice just to let her mind shut down and not think any more.   The hand that grabbed her chin and wrenched  her head to the right came as an utter surprise.  Akane was there in her wheelchair, sitting in  the blind spot caused by her bandaged eye.   Apparently, she'd been there the entire time.</p><p>"KUONJI,  you coward!  Don't you dare go catatonic on me!  I've still got a bet to settle with  you!"  Akane looked gloriously  furious.</p><p>"Akane?"  Ukyo  responded, shocked.  "But...But..."</p><p>Akane cut her  off.  "Damn you, Ukyo, Ranma would  spin in his grave if I let you die now.   Don't you dare let go without a fight!   I thought you were tough!"</p><p>Ukyo's soul of ice  shattered at last, and she finally gave in to the mourning that she'd denied  herself for almost a year.  "Oh Gods, Akane.   It hurts so bad.  When will the hurting go away?  I just want the hurting to go  away...please..."</p><p>Nabiki stood up and  walked away.  She paused at the door and  looked back to where the two weeping girls, one damaged in body, the other  damaged in soul, comforted each other.   They were still mourning, still hurting.   But they would heal.  They would  live.</p><p>Author's Note:</p><p>This is my version of  the semi-traditional "Saint Ukyo" story.  Even die-hard Ukyo fans have to admit the  girl tends to be a wee bit obsessive about things.  So I got to wondering:  Supposing she lost Ranma – what would she  obsess about next?</p>
