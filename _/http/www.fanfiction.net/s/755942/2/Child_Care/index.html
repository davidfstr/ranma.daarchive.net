</div>Chapter two: Color<p>The light broke through the window in the guest room and cast it's light on top of Ranma and Sakura. Sakura stirred in Ranma's arms as the light flashed over her eyes. Ranma sensing movement opened his eyes and looked down at Sakura and smiled. He slowly got up and looked over at his father. It had been nice not having to worry about being hit every morning. Since they had found Sakura Genma had stopped with the early morning impromptu sparring sessions. He had tried the first morning they had found Sakura and had almost hit Sakura. Ranma had gotten furious and had attacked Genma in anger. It was the first time he had ever attacked in such a way. Later Ranma had apologized to him and had actually been quite depressed for a while because he had felt so bad at losing control.<p>Genma watched from his futon and smiled. Ranma had gained an invaluable lesson of self-control since then. Ranma had learned the consequences and had learned from them as a true martial artist would. Genma was very proud of him, but would have denied it at every turn had anyone asked him. He watched Ranma get up groggily and get dressed. Genma raised one eyebrow as ranma tried to put his pants over his head. The boy still had a ways to go. Sakura lay on the futon sleeping peacefully. After Ranma finished dressing he picked Sakura up in his arms and made his way downstairs. Genma got up soon after they left and stretched his muscles. He followed and found everyone seated at the table eating dinner. He quickly sat down and started to shovel the food into his mouth.<p>The three Tendo daughters looked at him in disgust but came over it quickly enough. Ranma was feeding Sakura not paying attention to anything else. Sakura played with her food and giggled. She suddenly threw a spoonful of applesauce at Ranma's face. He quickly maneuvered out of the way only to hear it splatter behind him. He turned around to see Akane glaring at him, her face covered in applesauce. He quickly sputtered apologies only to find his own face covered in applesauce moments later. He turns around to see Sakura pouting, with the spoon in her hand. Nabiki started to laugh while Kasumi smiled, a giggle escaping her mouth. Ranma and Akane both glared at Nabiki, unable to even put up a displeasured expression against Kasumi. That was when Sakura started to poke Ranma in the chest with her spoon. He looked down and let out a sigh.<p>"Uh, Kasumi, could you take care of Sakura for a moment?" Ranma asked.<p>"It will be my pleasure," Kasumi answered in a calming voice.<p>"Thanks a bunch!" Ranma said while getting up.<p>"Hurry up boy! You have school today!" Genma suddenly bellowed.<p>"School?" Ranma asked curious.<p>"We will be staying here a while you know," Genma answered.<p>"Well I'm off. I have some business to take care of. Akane can take you there. Bye!" Nabiki told everyone while leaving.<p>Both Akane and Ranma raced up the stairs to get cleaned up. Moments later they were back down.<p>"Uh, what should I do about Sakura? Will she be alright here?" Ranma asked Kasumi.<p>"She'll be fine. Now get along," Kasumi said.<p>With that Ranma and Akane raced out the door.<p>*****<p>They had been walking for a few blocks when they came upon a high fence. Ranma immediately jumped on top and started walking. Akane looked up at him for a moment then turned her attention back to her front. They were walking when Akane suddenly started talking.<p>"We're not getting married you know!"<p>Ranma looked down at her and looked away. Akane was staring straight ahead with her head up high.<p>'Man, what a tomboy! I can't believe I thought she was cute!' Ranma thought silently to himself.<p>"You're telling me!" Ranma retorted quickly, reverting back to his old speech pattern without Sakura nearby.<p>"So don't go and hang around me at school or anything ok!" Akane continued.<p>"Don't worry! I can't stand macho chicks like you anyway!" Ranma shot right back.<p>Akane stood rigid and glared up at Ranma only to find him sliding forward with Genma hitting him on the head. Ranma got right back up while Akane stared in disbelief.<p>"Pop! What're you..."<p>"You're in no position to be choosy about women!" Genma started, "Listen Ranma, I'll tell you only once..."<p>Before he could finish Ranma quickly kicked him into the canal, which was on the other side of the fence. Genma splashed into the canal and came out, transformed into a panda.<p>"What's wrong pops? Weren't you going to say something?" Ranma jeered.<p>Genma jumped out of the water and over the fence. Ranma jumped down to avoid Genma and the water. Genma swiped his paw at Ranma only to miss. Ranma flipped backwards and landed in a pose when he was suddenly splashed with water, transforming into a girl.<p>"What the?"<p>Ranma looked around and spotted an old lady with a ladle. Akane looked on with an impassive expression on her face.<p>"Something wrong?" Akane asked.<p>"I'm think I'll go take a bath," Ranma said walking back towards the Tendo household.<p>"You'll be late," Akane said.<p>"You think I want to start the day off as a girl?" Ranma shot right back.<p>"Follow me. You just need hot water, right?"<p>"Uh... yeah."<p>"Ok"<p>Genma watched from the top of the fence and shook his head. The first day away from Sakura and the boy instantly reverted back to his old habits. Seems they weren't permanent.<p>'Well, hopefully the boy won't screw up too much,' Genma thought silently.<p>With that he ran off. A nearby jogger just shook his head and ran off. Nerima was getting stranger and stranger. He should have listened to his wife and moved out when they had the chance. The jogger sighed and ran off.<p>*****<p>Ranma stood around the corner waiting for Akane to get the pot when he felt something touch his left shoulder. He turned around, only to come face to face with a skeleton. He yelped and jumped into the air and onto the wall. As he got a closer look he saw the man holding the skeleton.<p>"Oh, pardon me. Nothing to worry about, dear! This is just Betty, my skeleton," the man stated.<p>Akane turned the corner a moment later and started to talk when she saw the man and bowed, hitting Ranma in the head with the kettle of hot water.<p>"Doctor! Uh... Good morning!" Akane stuttered.<p>"Good morning to you!" the doctor replied.<p>Ranma just stared as a blush covered Akane's face.<p>'Hates all men, huh.' Ranma thought.<p>He quickly walked around the corner and splashed the water over himself. He just listened to the conversation between Akane and Dr. Tofu. After a few moments he walked back out and started running slowly towards the direction they had been going. Akane spotted him and quickly ran after him after giving Dr. Tofu a quick goodbye. Dr. Tofu just watched.<p>'Hmm, wonder who that person was.' he thought silently when an old woman came up to him.<p>"Oh! Chisu-san! How are you today?"<p>*****<p>Ranma ran slightly behind Akane on top of the fence. The two of them ran in silence when Ranma decided to ask a question.<p>"Who was that guy?"<p>"Dr. Tofu. He's the chiropractor. Good, isn't he?" Akane answered him.<p>"Martial Arts master, isn't he," Ranma said, more of as a statement then as a question.<p>"Huh? How could you tell?" Akane asked, surprised.<p>Ranma just stared at the ground.<p>"Well, he is very good. He's a really good doctor too. He's taken care of me since I was little," Akane said.<p>At that Ranma jumped down and ran along side Akane.<p>"Well, isn't he a man?"<p>"Yea, so?" Akane asked.<p>"I thought you said you hate men," Ranma said.<p>This time Akane just looked at the ground, however her face hardened considerably.<p>"That's right! I HATE MEN!" Akane yelled at the top of her lungs as a large group of boys suddenly appeared at the entrance of the school.<p>Ranma watched with a raised eyebrow as Akane ran ahead straight into the mob. He jumped onto a nearby wall and watched from above.<p>'What the hell.' Ranma thought.<p>Ranma looked at Akane as she beat the living daylights out of everyone. He noticed a particularly damaging hit and winced.<p>'He's gonna feel that one later,' Ranma thought when someone yelled at him from above.<p>"Ranma! Get into the school now!" Nabiki yelled out.<p>"But what about her?" Ranma asked, pointing at Akane, who was now finished and panting a little.<p>"For crying out loud. Everyday." Akane started when she was interrupted.<p>"Truly, such a boorish lot," the voice said.<p>Ranma blanched as he spotted the owner of the voice. He completely ignored everything that the boy with the bokken said and just stared at him. That was until he saw the rose being flung at Akane. His eyes darkened. This boy was strange, and he was pretty strong. stronger then Akane at least. He immediately jumped in front of Akane and grabbed the rose out of the air. He glared at the boy.<p>"Hey! Stay out of the way or you'll get hur-" Akane started when she felt a wave of chi wash over her.<p>'What the.' Akane thought when she stared at Ranma's back.<p>He was glowing with chi, more specifically light blue chi. Kuno looked completely oblivious and continued to talk. Akane just stared wide-eyed when another wave of chi hit her. This time she was able to identify the feelings being transmitted through the chi. Akane looked up at Ranma. He was protecting her. Without even thinking Ranma had jumped in front of her.<p>'Hey! I can handle this myself!' Akane yelled at herself when she heard Kuno's voice boom out.<p>"WHAT! Under the same roof as Akane!" Kuno yelled while swinging his bokken at Ranma.<p>Ranma merely jumped backwards.<p>"I'm the heir to the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts," Ranma said while taking off his backpack.<p>"Hey, Akane, can you hold this?" Ranma asked tossing it lightly towards her.<p>Akane caught the bag and just stared. Ranma had completely changed. His eyes were filled with a look of caring, none of the arrogant look they had held before. Also the light blue aura had become slightly darker in color. She just watched as Ranma turned and faced Kuno. Ranma closed his eyes then opened them again, this time his eyes filled with a new fire, fueled by the thought of fighting a new opponent. The chi around his body finally became dark blue.<p>"I am Ranma Saotome! And I accept your challenge!"<p>*****<p>Nabiki watched this all from above. She noticed the blue aura Ranma had given off before. Being around martial artists her whole life she instantly realized what it was but it hadn't been the fact that he could generate the aura that surprised her. It had been the color of the aura. Nabiki had long since figured out that the color of an aura was just an extension of the feelings being emitted. Which colors represented what feelings however she wasn't too sure of yet. Nabiki thought back to the time when she had first seen a person's manifested aura. She had been watching her father train one day in the dojo when a small amount of dark blue aura manifested around him. She had later on learned that it had been her father's confidence that had let him generate the chi. She had never seen another color aura except once. A robber had found his way into the house when her father had found him and stood in a fighting stance. Instead of the normal dark blue shade that normally surrounded him the shade was much lighter. Nabiki had been fairly nearby and the feeling she received from the chi had completely clamed her nerves. There was no arrogance or confidence, only the feeling of wanting to protect. Needless to say the robber was beaten into a pulp moments later. Nabiki never saw that shade again. When her mom had dies her father was never again able to give off any aura whatsoever. The next time she had seen an aura was the first few times Akane had fought the hentai horde. The color had been a raging red reflecting the anger and frustration. Soon that too faded as Akane became tired of the constant fighting. Nabiki had been worried, when Ranma had suddenly showed up. Nabiki glanced down and noticed the dark blue aura surrounding Ranma. It was much larger then anything her father had ever achieved. Nabiki smiled.<p>'He definitely belongs with Akane. If I didn't know any better I'd say he already feels it too, at least on a subconscious level. I knew it! Akane was attracted to him!'<p>Nabiki just sat back and watched, laughing to herself.<p>'This should be interesting, and the possibilities. if I use him right he'll be a regular gold mine for me.'<p>*****<p>Akane just stood there, thoughts running through her mind.<p>'He has so much control over his chi. how on earth. well I could probably do it too. that feeling I got before.'<p>Akane just shook her head and gave up trying to organize her thoughts and watched the oncoming fight. Kuno had his bokken raised and had been ready to run ahead when he finally noticed the blue aura surrounding Ranma. It stopped him cold. The amount of confidence was unnerving. Kuno shook his head once.<p>'It's all just a trick. It has to be, there is no one better then me!' Kuno yelled to himself.<p>In a burst of speed Kuno ran forward, a small aura surrounding his bokken. Just as he was swinging down Ranma disappeared and reappeared on the trunk of a tree. Kuno, by this time completely blinded by adrenaline, shot forward again. This time he cut through the outer layer of the tree, yet still missed Ranma, who was now behind Kuno. With one swift sweep to the legs he tripped Kuno, who fell down and hit his head on a rock knocking him out. Almost immediately the large aura around Ranma died.<p>"Geez, that was boring," Ranma said aloud.<p>He looked at Akane.<p>"Uh, I guess we can go in now." Ranma said tugging on his pigtail.<p>Akane just walked forward. As the two entered the school a drop of rain feel on Kuno's head, and then another and another. By the time Kuno had gotten up and walked into the school he was soaked to the bone. Genma stood from behind the wall, rain dripping off his fur, with a contemplative look in his eyes.<p>'Since when did the boy learn to control his aura like that?'<p>*****<p>"It seems that you were in China until recently. Well, is there anything else you'd like to say Saotome-san?"<p>"Err, not really,"<p>"Well then, you can take a seat behind Tendo-san," the sensei said pointing at the only empty seat in the room.<p>"Uh, ok," Ranma said walking to his seat.<p>A couple of girls stared at Ranma as he walked by swooning as he passed. Akane just rolled her eyes and looked away. A closer look in her eyes would have revealed much more. Ranma just sat down and sighed.<p>'Why did I jump in front of Akane? It's not like I wanted to protect her or anything. I'm not jealous or anything, I mean, she's just an uncute tomboy anyways.' Ranma said looking at Akane, who was currently staring off when the teacher yelled out.<p>"Saotome-san, please refrain from staring at Tendo-san."<p>Ranma quickly turned to the front, his face bright red. Akane looked back and blushed brightly as well.<p>'Stupid pervert.' Akane thought.<p>'Shit, she probably thinks I'm some kind of pervert now.' Ranma sighed.<p>The class laughed until the teacher rapped the board with a ruler. Everyone sighed and turned their attention back to the teacher. That was of course when Kuno yanked open the door and yelled.<p>"Never Saotome! I will never accept your engagement to Akane!"<p>The class immediately burst into a frenzy with Ranma and Akane as the focal points. Kuno couldn't even manage to get in another word as everyone ignored him. Kuno just stood there with a blank face then yelled out again.<p>"Saotome! Come fight me! I will beat you, you enslaver of women!"<p>"Not here Kuno! Follow me!" Ranma yelled leaping over the crowd and over Kuno into the hallway.<p>Kuno stood dumbfounded again as everyone continued to ignore him. In anger he ran off after Ranma. Ranma, now being followed by Kuno and the rest of his class, who had followed Kuno after he had left, headed for an open window.<p>'Let's see him follow me now,' Ranma thought turning his head to see the stampede.<p>At the last minute Ranma jumped up to the window and leaped out. Kuno blindly followed and everyone else rushed to see the outcome, expecting to see two splatters on the ground.<p>"This is the third floor!" one of Ranma's classmates yelled out.<p>"Not a problem! I'm a martial artist!" Ranma yelled, and true to form landed gracefully on the grass. At the last minute Ranma moved out of the way as Kuno plummeted into the ground like a stake.<p>"Whoa." the guy who had tried to warn Ranma before stuttered.<p>"What the." another guy started.<p>"He's incredible." a couple of the girls sighed dreamily.<p>Akane just rolled her eyes and ran down the stairs to see what was going on. As she reached the entrance she ran into Ranma who was currently very feminine, very wet and not very happy.<p>"What happened?" Akane yelled pushing Ranma through a door, which just happened to be the girl's bathroom.<p>"I was walking back in when the sprinklers turned on." Ranma grumbled.<p>Suddenly the two jumped back as a toilet flushed in one of the stalls. A girl with long dark black hair exited the stall. Ranma immediately turned around. Akane just stood still with a forced smile on her face. The girl was not someone Akane wanted to deal with.<p>"Hey Akane," The girl sneered.<p>"Hey Kumi." Akane sighed.<p>"Whose the red head?" Kumi asked.<p>"'s. umm. my cousin!" Akane blurted out.<p>Kumi just stared at Akane, and then shrugged her shoulders and walked out, after washing her hands. Akane sighed when Ranma turned around.<p>"Cousin? That's the best you could come up with?" Ranma yelled.<p>"Hey! Do you want everyone to find out about you?" Akane yelled back.<p>"Urk. fine." Ranma grumbled.<p>"If they did, rumors would be all over the school in seconds," Akane said.<p>On the outside of the door Kumi smiled.<p>'Now what kind of secret is the glorious Akane Tendo keeping?' Kumi thought to herself.<p>She walked away smiling a dark smile. Students that saw her backed away in fear. Kumi had always had a reputation of destroying other people's reputations. Everyone looked at Hikaru Gosunkugi who just so happened to be standing right there. He had been the first victim of Kumi's blackmail. No one knew what had happened but the results were enough of a warning for people to steer clear of Kumi. Gosunkugi looked at Kumi and shuddered. She had destroyed his life and now she was aiming to destroy Akane's as well. Gosunkugi looked at the girl's bathroom for a while thinking of ways to protect his love when he got blindsided by another girl. The girl walked away whispering to other girls.<p>"He was staring at the bathroom for like five minutes!"<p>"Such a pervert."<p>Gosunkugi sighed. He remembered when he wasn't such an outcast. He got up slowly and walked away holding a voodoo doll. They were going pay, every one of them. Especially Kumi. then he and Akane could live peacefully forever. Gosunkugi walked on with a scary smile on his face.<p>*****<p>Sakura rolled on the ground near Genma-panda. Soun played around with Sakura making funny faces. Sakura grabbed at Soun's moustache and pulled hard. Soun yelped and tried to get Sakura to let go. Kasumi came into the room and gently took Sakura into her arms. The second Sakura let go of Soun's moustache however she started to cry. Genma rolled over and covered his ears.<p>'Hurry and come home, boy. She has too much energy for me to handle.' Genma thought sadly.<p>Kasumi placed Sakura down next to Genma. She instantly latched onto her favorite play toy. Genma sighed. Sakura laughed happily while playing around on the giant panda.<p>*****<p>Ranma sneezed right before a bucket of hot water splashed over his head. Akane slowly looked out the door and motioned for Ranma to come out. Both of them jumped out the door and slammed it shut before anyone saw them come out. Akane started upstairs when she noticed Ranma heading out the door.<p>"What are you doing?" Akane yelled.<p>"Going home. The teacher will make us stand outside anyways. Besides, I want to check on Sakura," Ranma said nonchalantly.<p>Akane just followed Ranma out the door with a frown on her face.<p>'I'm gonna get in trouble for this. oh well.' Akane thought silently.<p>Ranma walked ahead of Akane until they exited the school where he turned around and waited for Akane to catch up. As soon as Akane was next to him he continued walking. Kumi watched from a window upstairs.<p>'Where's the redhead?' she thought silently.<p>Kumi's face darkened and people backed away. It seemed she would need to reacquaint herself with another Tendo if she was going to find out anything. Kumi sighed. This was going to take a lot of work gaining the trust of the Ice Queen of Furinkan High.<p>*****<p>Ranma walked quickly but steadily. Akane kept up with him. Neither one was saying anything when someone called out Akane's name. The two turned around to find Dr. Tofu waving at them from outside his clinic. Akane waved back and headed in his direction. Ranma shrugged his shoulders and followed.<p>"Hello Akane. How was your day?" Dr. Tofu asked when he spotted Ranma.<p>'Oh, he was the young man that Akane ran off with in the morning.' he thought silently.<p>"Whose your friend?" Dr. Tofu asked before Akane could answer his first question.<p>"Oh, he's Ranma Saotome. He's staying at our house for a while," Akane said without any feeling.<p>Ranma just stared and nodded his head in acknowledgement. He then turned around and stared at the sky. Akane noticed this and became slightly annoyed. She continued her conversation with Dr. Tofu. Soon enough the two said their good byes and Akane ran to catch up with Ranma, who had already started his way home. When Akane caught up with Ranma she hit him in the head with her bag.<p>"What the hell did you do that for, you stupid tomboy!" Ranma yelled out.<p>"Why were you so rude to Dr. Tofu?" Akane yelled back.<p>"I wasn't being rude! I-I just had other things on my mind," Ranma stuttered.<p>Akane just raised her eyebrow. Then she faced forward and headed home at an even faster pace giving Ranma the cold shoulder the entire time. Ranma merely walked behind her without saying a word. As soon as they opened the door Genma ran to meet Ranma. Ranma jumped back in surprise.<p>"You're finally home boy! Take care of Sakura, she has too much energy for me!" Genma sobbed.<p>"What the. hey, is Sakura ok? How is she?" Ranma asked quickly.<p>"She's fine. just. too energetic for me." Genma said tiredly.<p>Ranma looked behind Genma and spotted Sakura on the ground. Sakura instantly spotted Ranma and raised her arms towards him. Ranma quickly made his way to Sakura and tossed her into the air. Akane watched as Ranma quickly changed personas.<p>'Why won't he be that nice with me?' Akane thought silently.<p>She quickly turned around and was about to run upstairs when she noticed something. She turned around and looked at Ranma. There was a small soft blue glow around him. He had the same air around him that Kasumi always had, only on a slightly bigger scale. As she stood there she realized it was the same feeling as when Ranma had jumped in front of her at the school. She blushed realizing what the feeling was. She quickly turned around and ran upstairs without another thought.<p>'Maybe. he does like me. Wait, why should I care? He's just a stupid stuck up pervert!' Akane yelled at herself.<p>Genma also noticed the glow surrounding Ranma.<p>'His need to protect Sakura has made him much more powerful then I thought. It seems I was wrong in thinking the girl would only get in the way,' Genma thought.<p>The large panda turned around and walked outside and lay on the porch quickly falling asleep. Ranma noticed this and sighed.<p>"Geez, what a lazy panda. Isn't that right Sakura," Ranma said making a funny face to Sakura, who started to giggle.<p>Ranma just sat there and played with Sakura. Kasumi watched from the hallway and smiled. It was nice to see the two interact. Ranma was much more mature then she realized.<p>'He'd be a good husband.' Kasumi thought before she realized what she was thinking.<p>'He's much to young for me though.' Kasumi quickly thought to herself.<p>She stole one more look at Ranma and walked back into the kitchen, a slight blush on her cheeks. That was when she noticed a book lying on the kitchen counter.<p>"Oh my, I forgot to return Dr. Tofu's book. I'll have to ask Akane to do it tomorrow."<p>*****<p>Akane lay on her bed with her eyes closed. She didn't know what to think anymore. One second Ranma was making fun of her, and then suddenly he's being incredibly sweet. Then there was his aura's color, the soft baby blue. It made her skin tingle with joy. She had felt a feeling of safety overcome her at that moment. She looked back at the memory of Sakura when Ranma had been near. She suddenly found herself jealous of the little girl. Quickly shaking her head, she scolded herself, and then sighed.<p>"What am I thinking about? I don't care about this!" She quietly yelled to herself.<p>She got up and sat down at her desk and began to do her homework when she heard Sakura laugh out loud. A sense of longing struck her heart hard. The dark loneliness that had slowly crept its way into Akane's heart began to grow again. She shut her eyes hard and shook her head. She wasn't about to let herself fall into the darkness again. She opened her eyes again and took a deep breath and stared down at the paper in front of her.<p>"Ok, so the cos of 64 times 34."<p>Author's Notes: A series of events have been set in motion. What's the significance of the aura colors and what is this darkness that Akane refers too? And what of Kumi and Hikaru's involvement in all of this? Answers and more to come in subsequent chapters! Please R&amp;R! On a side note. how does everyone think about this fic? I don't know if it's that great so far. sigh. so tired..
