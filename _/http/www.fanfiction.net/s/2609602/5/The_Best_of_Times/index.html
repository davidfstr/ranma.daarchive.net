</div><p><b>The Best of Times...</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i><br/>A Fukufics (dotcom)  Production</p><b>Part Five</b><p><b>"D</b>ead Scream."</p><p>The line of energy hit  its target dead on, blowing it back fifty feet through a concrete  divider and into its own personal smoldering crater. Setsuna hadn't  even bothered to transform in initiating the blast. While she could  get away with that in public once or twice, going full Senshi was an  outright no-no. She made one last cursory inspection of the smoking  trench the attack had created and smiled at a job well done. Now  maybe she could—</p><p>"<i>I fight on!"</i></p><p>Setsuna Meiou froze,  while her cheek muscle had developed a nervous tick to it. She turned  to find her tormentor staggering out of the dusty ruin, his black  suit in tatters. The once proud sunglasses fell away in molten ruin  while his bokken burned like a torch. Why wouldn't he just stay  down! Her mind raced. At first she had thought this Prince R was a  pervert. The second time made him a dumb pervert. The third, a  determined pervert. After that, she had begun resorting to Dead  Screams in order to dissuade his unwelcome advances. Seventh time's  a charm maybe?</p><p>"Indeed… You are as  formidable as your beauty…. Suggests…" Prince R, otherwise  known as Tatewake Kuno, was fighting for every breath his labored  movements produced. "Therefore… I shall… Allow you to… Date  me!" The woman sometimes known as Sailor Pluto growled maliciously.</p><p><b>"DEAD SCREAM! DEAD  SCREAM! </b><b>DEAD SCREAM!"</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"So that's the  other end of the porthole?" Usagi stared at the holographic image  Ami had produced using the Mercury Computer remote.<p>Ami nodded, brushing a  bit of hair from her face. "Yep. A pocket universe no more than a  hundred kilometers in diameter."</p><p>Rei stared at the  floating bubble, which held a bright blob in the center. "Ok, then,  what's that?" She poked the insubstantial orange blob, cutting  through the hologram to do so.</p><p>"It's the only  thing I could get an accurate reading on." Ami replied. "Seems to  be a large power source of some sort. I'd almost rate it a mini  star."</p><p>"And the youma are  coming from that?" Michiru wondered and her partner spoke up.</p><p>"Well, hell. We'll  just send Hotaru in and waste the place with a Death Reborn."  Haruka commented. "She'll vaporize a hundred kilometers like it  isn't even there."</p><p>This earned an arched  eyebrow from Mercury. "Uh huh. And how is she going to survive the  resultant collapse her DRR creates?" Michiru asked pointedly, to  which Uranus remained silent. "That power source is likely the only  thing keeping the pocket stable. Go in and Death Reborn it and you'll  probably wipe yourself out when it folds in upon  itself."</p><p>"That, and we should  probably figure out what's going on in there anyway." Usagi  pointed out.</p><p>Hotaru  wasn't  necessarily thrilled with the idea of unleashing the vast amounts of  power at her command. It was what made her feared by others and  generally made what little she remembered of the Silver Millenium a  miserable existence. It was a tough life, being a strategic weapon of  mass destruction. "Right. Maybe Pluto can get a better feel  for what we're up against."</p><p>As if bidden by her  name, Pluto staggered into the meeting looking less than pristine. In  fact, she looked rather exhausted and bedraggled, truth be told. Michiru took one  look at the disheveled state of her fellow outer and gasped. "What  the <i>hell</i> happened to you?"</p><p>If she had looked  fatigued before, the scrunched face and fire in her eyes seemed to  banish it completely with the question. "$#$# Prince R happened,  that's what!"</p><p>Minako's eyes  sparkled. "You MET Prince R? He talked to you personally?" The  remainder of the Inners were beginning to feel a tad jealous.</p><p>"Um, didn't you  <i>like</i> him?" Usagi asked carefully, noticing the steady anger boiling  from the Senshi.</p><p>"<i>Like him!</i>"  Setsuna blew a fuse. Several of them, in fact. "He's the most  arrogant, overbearing, pushy, self-centered perverted asshole I've ever  met!"</p><p>Rei was blinking in  confusion now. "You mean you didn't find him handsome, nice,  chivalrous and powerful?" She cocked her head. "Did I mention  he's a total dish?"</p><p><i>"A total dish!</i>"  The Senshi of time screeched. "A total PERVERT is what he is!"</p><p>"Er…" Michiru was  at a loss, never having seen this Prince R. Still, he was a guy and  Michiru of all people knew what THAT meant. She shared a knowing look  with Haruka, who nodded in return. "Come on, Set-chan. We can talk  about it in the next room." The trio departed leaving the confused  Inners in their wake.</p><p>"She didn't like  Prince R?" Ami put the question to nobody in particular. Who  <i>wouldn't</i> like Prince R? The Inners looked from one to the  other, then to the room Uranus, Neptune and Pluto departed to. While  several thoughts came to mind in that instant, two were mutually  shared by the girls.</p><p>They had no idea Pluto was like <i>that</i>... It was either that, or  she really, <i>really</i> needed to get out more because all that time spent around the Gates was clearly driving her insane.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<i>It is done." </i><p><i>A shimmering crystal floated into the darkened  sky, its brilliance a sharp contrast to the fallout  boiling over her. Queen Serenity fell to her knees as her reserves  washed away. Like the crystal that now winked high above, she too was  a sharp contrast to the buckled, ruined landscape around her. In one  series of combined attacks, the Silver Millennium had died and its  Queen would soon follow into eternity.</i></p><p><i>Serenity smiled gently at the green haired  Senshi that kneeled with her, tears falling from Pluto's last surviving  Princess. She and the Advisors would be the only survivors of this  great era, but its ruler had taken steps to ensure that the Millenium  would not be forgotten. Artemis and Luna would go forward to ensure  that when her children did arise, they would do so with friends.  Setsuna Meiou had the much harder task, a task the Queen would not  wish upon another soul. The Crescent Wand fell from her hand and the  felines began to waver, fading from reality. </i></p><p>"<i>On behalf of the  moon, you will be free. Maybe we'll meet again, someday…" </i></p><p><i>It fell to the charred ground and the cats were  gone, swallowed up by a temporal vortex that represented the last of  Queen Serenity's power. Her last breath taken, she slipped away,  white gown flowing along the tattered ground.</i></p><p><i>Setsuna Meiou was the Guardian of Time, the  last remaining Princess of Pluto and now sole survivor of the Silver  Millennium. She was also the last person to see Queen Serenity alive.<hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>Ranma Saotome, heir  apparent to the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts sat strait up in  his futon, suddenly wide-awake. He looked around, only to find a dark  room occupied in part by a snoring old man. What in the HELL was  <i>that!</i> Screw the dead woman, the dream had been nothing short  of an all out apocalyptic free for all! Lasers, building to building  combat and freakin' huge starships. And who was the last person  standing? <i>Sailor Pluto</i>. Nightmare. Had to be. Besides, he  could always tell a nightmare from everything else. How?</p><p><i>All</i> his nightmares  featured <i>cats</i>.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A horizontal tornado  cut through the youma ranks that were pressing Sailor Moon back,  carving up the very earth as it annihilated the Senshi's opponents.  Usangi turned to find a crimson and white fuku leaping into fray,  sliding in beside her. "Sorry I'm late, your Highness."<p>Usagi stared at the  redhead for a moment in shock and the others took that as their cue  to regroup around the Princess. She broke out of her stunned daze and  smiled with a nod. Sailor Nova took up a position on her flank and  the remainder of the Senshi- Mercury, Venus and Jupiter arrayed  around them. Moon's smile disappeared quickly, however as she  considered the mass of youma in front of them. It was a full-scale  incursion, with an initial number of around fifty of the monsters  spilling from the gate this time. The three girls were the only ones  on scene at the time and managed a respectable job in carving up their  numbers, but each one of them was more than happy to see Usagi's  elite body guard arrive on scene. The others would be there  momentarily, but the buffer Sailor Nova would create was more than  welcome in the meantime.</p><p>"So what's the  plan, your Worshipfulness?" Nova inquired with a slight smirk.</p><p>Sailor Moon's spirits  immediately began to lift with the redhead's playful mood, the fact  that she might have just been insulted not even occurring to the  blonde. "Hmm, wait here for the others to arrive?"</p><p>"Wrong Answer!" the  redhead piped merrily and brought the staff around to a striking  position. "In the name of the Moon, it's time to kick some ass  and take some names!"</p><p>"Um, youma don't  <i>have</i> names…" Sailor Mercury pointed out somewhat  redundantly.</p><p>Nova's smile gained a  whole new level of mischief. "Then I guess there's only one thing  to do then—<i>SHINING NOVA!"</i> A radiant blue ball of power  erupted from the Alpha Guardian's hand, flashing outward into the  now advancing horde. Two of the monsters were vaporized outright  while another two sustained enough injury to totally incapacitate  them when the sphere of ki detonated. Sure it was  a Moko Takabisha by any other name, but it wouldn't do to advertise  her signature moves by their proper names in mixed company.<br/>It took the Senshi a  few precious moments to regain their wits before they engaged the  horde as well, cutting loose with magical attacks that ripped through  their lines. With Sailor Nova as the anchor, the last youma went down  just as the Outers arrived on scene with Chibi Moon in tow.</p><p>Three outers and a pink  haired girl landed on scene only to find youma ash already scattering  to the wind. The tomboyish blond had a dejected look about her. "You  called us here for this, you Clutz—<i>OOOF!"</i></p><p>One moment Sailor Nova  was standing next to Moon and the next her fist was imbedded in  Haruka's stomach as if teleported there. She doubled over on impact  and Sailor Nova followed the stroke through, her elbow swinging  savagely into her chin. The Senshi seemed to lift into the air about  two feet before landing hard on her derrière. Even Michiru  standing beside her gaped.</p><p>Sailor Nova bent over  the stricken girl and summoned forth the most condescending tone she  could muster. "You're not too bright are ya? What did I tell you  about insulting the Princess?"</p><p>An intangible wave of  power slapped into Nova as Sailor Uranus's power levels spiked.  "THAT'S IT! YOU'RE GOING DOWN!" Her snap kick failed to  connect and now the redhead stood standing ten feet from her.</p><p>"So bring it,  already."</p><p>Uranus  examined her  opponent carefully. The attack had been surprising in more ways than  one. First, the little redheaded bitch was ungodly fast, so fast that  her only warning had been a blur of motion. The second fact was  slightly more surprising—She had expected far more power behind  that fist. Oh sure, it was powerful enough and she'd be feeling it  for the next few days, but either the girl was really pulling her  punches or she just didn't have the same absolute power the rest of  the Senshi had. Sailor Nova, in the meantime, had come to somewhat  the same conclusion. It hadn't been full power, but the tomboy  shouldn't  have been able to pick herself up off the ground quite that easily.  The fuku armor, she decided silently. If anything, it caused her grin  to widen, which took Haruka back slightly. Wasn't she the one with the  edge? only one through course through Nova's mind-</p><p>Finally, something that  could absorb the punishment she was capable of dishing out.</p><p>Sailor Uranus may have  had the advantage in terms of raw power, but there was no way she  could have known that she was nothing more than a sparring post to  Nova. Her own fist cruised in, but to Nova, she was slow. Insanely  slow. Especially after fighting some of her more exotic rivals.  Haruka smiled ferally as the fist seemed certain to break the little  red imp's nose… then she was gone. The Outer Senshi only had  enough time to notice the shadow eclipsing the light above her before  two aerial kicks slashed into her face, sending Uranus careening  wildly out of control and into the ground one more.</p><p>The redhead landed  lightly beside her. "Wanna apologize to the Princess now, sport?"</p><p>"GRRRRrrrrRRR…"  Uranus was just pushing herself off the ground when an unexpected  sound was heard. It was a happy and melodious sound, something  entirely inappropriate to the situation.</p><p>"Heheheheheee…."  Both brawlers stopped and turned to the pink haired girl, who was  once again quivering unnaturally. "BWAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH!"  A sweat drop rolled down the head of everybody on scene.  "OHOHOHOHO! WAHAHAHA!"</p><p>Sailor Nova simply  stared. "What the hell…."</p><p>"…IS SO DAMN  FUNNY!" Uranus finished the sentiment.</p><p>Sailor Chibi managed to  reign in the laughter. Slightly. "Heheheh! Some rice… Hehehe! And…  hehehe-snort-heheh! Two pickles! BWAHAHAHAHAHA!"</p><p>It must have been the  punch line to the funniest damn joke in the universe, except that  nobody was getting it… Except one redheaded Sailor Senshi, who  noticeably paled. She took a slight step away from the insane pink  haired girl, as if she were a ticking time bomb.</p><p>Sailor  Moon took  advantage of the break in hostilities. "Um, I know! Let talk about  it over ice cream." The Inners, not totally oblivious to the fine  line being walked between Nova and the Outers readily agreed, and the  suggestion seemed to pull Chibi Usa out of her humorous fit, though her  eyes still shined. Nova looked from Moon to Uranus to Chibi. Trapped.  If  she bugged out now, it would look suspicious as hell, or like she was  running away from a fight; she wasn't sure which was worse. If she  did stay, she faced the prospect of hanging out with a bunch of  twiddling girls and the questions they undoubtably had for her. And  then there was Chibi Moon who <i>knew</i>….Something. Unless she  had been in contact with the Tendos, there was no way she should  have known THAT particular event that happened so long ago in her  life. Curiosity made the decision for Sailor Nova. She had to find  out just how deep she was in it with this Senshi.</p><p>"My, what a flashy  transformation you had back there." Haruka eyed the redheaded imp  with suspicion as she scooped the ice cream out of her cup. ""Not  like ours at all."</p><p>"Well, hey," Yumei  Ikari, aka Sailor Nova, aka Ranko Tendo, aka Ranma Saotome rose to  the challenge. She had been expecting it, in fact. "If you wanna  give the boys a free peep show, that's all you." Half the Senshi  present in the ice cream parlor began to choke on their frozen  dessert, as if suddenly aware of their highly revealing  transformation process. Haruka and Michiru both turned beet-red,  given their sexual orientation. "As for me, I'll settle for  burning the pervert's eyeballs out."</p><p>Many of the girls  present at the moment silently began to amend their transformation  sequence.</p><p>Chibi Usa continued to  barely suppress the occasional giggle as she ate, a behavior that was  beginning to annoy 'Yumei' to no end. She didn't like to dance around  confrontation, so she charged into it instead. If her cover was to be  blown, she'd rather know right here and now. "So what's you  story, Squirt?"</p><p>The giggling ceased  immedietly as the pink haired girl held the redhead in a thoughtful  look. Then her face broke out in a wide smile. "Story… <i>Uncle</i>  Yumei?" Yumei twitched and now all the Senshi were staring at Small  Lady.</p><p>"<i>Uncle?</i>"</p><p>It wasn't necessarily  the gender pronoun that had the girls on edge all of a sudden. After  all, they were all quite used to Hotaru calling Hakaru 'papa'.  The fact that Chibi had just named another relative beyond Moon and  Kamen, however, did not go unnoticed.</p><p>Yumei-Ranma shook her  head. This was just getting weirder and weirder. Like her life wasn't  already insane enough as it is. "Sorry, kiddo. Got me mistaken for  somebody else. Do I look like a guy to you?"</p><p>"Of course not,  <i>Uncle</i>-san!" Chibi Usa snickered. "What a <i>curse</i>  that'd be!" Yumei-Ranma twitched again and the girl broke down  once again.</p><p>"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma Saotome stepped  up to the gates of the Tendo dojo with a noticeable lack of a spring  in his step. It had been a rough day. No, the two bouts of youma  attacks hadn't done it. Or the incessant hostility between him and  Sailor Uranus. No, what was really bugging him was the small pink  haired girl who hadn't stopped with the icecream parlor. Her  dropping of hints continued for the rest of the day and it became  obvious that Chibi Usa knew exactly who he was. Oddly enough, she  never bothered to explain them to the other curious Senshi, as if it  were her own private joke. Ranma thought hard on the situation. She  was somebody who knew who Nova was and was closely associated with  Pluto, but was withholding her true identity regardless. Even so, her  relentless needling had taken its toll.<p>Ranma stepped through  the house door and was immediately filled with a sense of dread.  <i>Karma.</i> Like a great white shark, it had returned, intending to  finish the victim it had taken a bite out of weeks earlier. Few  people were as attuned to karma as the Saotome, and now it washed  across him like a flood. The bickering that filtered through the  house was easily heard and it all stopped the moment he set foot into  the living room.</p><p>Ranma was quite certain  that the woman standing in the middle of it had something to do with  the matter. He glanced at Akane's face, whose burning visage told  him everything. New fiancée. Had to be. Dammit, that woman was  SO going to get it. He didn't want to move to Phase Three, but she  brought it down upon herself. But first thing was first.</p><p>The woman turned around  and it was only years of built up immunity that kept him from picking  his jaw up off the floor. She was absolutely gorgeous. Ranma had long  since considered his own girl type to be at the top of the hottie  food pyramid, but this new fiancée took the cake, ate it and  asked for seconds. She stood about 5'8", had luxurious brown hair  and a body that most girls would die for. Everything that she wore  seemed to emphasis that last fact, from the tight white top that  couldn't hope to hide her ample breasts to the short, skintight  skirt.</p><p>Maybe he'd hold off  on Pluto for a bit.</p><p>"Hello!" The woman  gushed; stepping over to Ranma to embrace his hand warmly. "You  probably don't remember, but your father and my grandfather pledged  us to marry quite some time ago. My name is Makoto Kashiwagi!"</p><p>"Um,  nice to meet  ya." Ranma let a polite smile escape his face for the nice girl,  but nothing more than that. To do anything more was to risk grave  injury at the hands of the first fiancée. The martial artist  turned to Nabiki, who had been expecting the silent query. She held a  sheet of paper in response and he simply sighed. Well, it wasn't  all bad, he suspposed. Pluto must really be slipping to send somebody  this attractive. Of course, it could have just been a coincidence…</p><p>Ranma almost burst out  laughing at the insanity of the thought.</p><p>"Uh, Miss Kashiwagi…"</p><p>"Call me Mako-chan."  She supplied with a beautiful smile. Akane began to glow in the  background and the family edged away from her.</p><p>"Er, Right. Have they  already explained the situation?" Ranma motioned toward the family  and refused to acknowledge his father's existence.</p><p>Mako-chan nodded.  "Quite complex, but I'm sure <i>we'll</i> have it worked out in  no time." Nobody missed the emphasis, let alone Akane Tendo.</p><p>"You two timing  CASSANOVA! <i>Another</i> fiancée!" The table was in the  air and impact was imminent when Ranma reacted on instinct, whipping  the new girl out of the way and shattering the table with a fist. The  room now stood in shock.</p><p>"Dammit, Akane! She's  not even a martial artist!" It was probably the only thing that  would have earned a rebuke from him, but her behavior was quite  unacceptable. Sure the last month had been stressful on her. No, yet  another fiancée wasn't helping matters. But her reactions  were getting as bad as Ryogas! The youngest Tendo seemed to  realize this too, and paled.</p><p>"I'm… I'm  sorry!" She blurted and ran upstairs to her room in tears. The rest  of the family looked at him expectantly.</p><p>Ranma sighed. "Yeah,  I'd better see if she's okay…"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Few things could  outright stop the martial artist's mental process these days, as the  strangeness in Ranma's life could be shrugged off like a pellet  striking adamantium plating. Strangeness, however, was about to  deliver the boy an armor piercing round as he stepped into Akane's  room, determined to check on his part time fiancée. His eyes  were immediately pulled from the sulking girl to the walls, which  were plastered floor to ceiling with…<p>"Sailor <i>Nova?"</i></p><p>Akane sniffled. "Yeah,  so what?"</p><p>Ranma now looked like a  trapped animal, eyes darting wildly from wall to wall. Sailor Nova  was <i>everywhere</i>. "It's just… uh.. Well…" It was just  plain <i>freaky</i> that the woman who had serious anger management  and trust issues with him was idolizing his Senshi alter ego, but he  didn't feel the need to elaborate on that particular topic. Ranma  wandered over to her desk, which had a Nova action figure poised on  it. <i>Riiiight</i>. Somebody has been <i>busy</i>.</p><p>"Heck, she's  probably better than you are!" Akane blurted defensively upon  seeing his quizzled expression.</p><p>Ranma opened his mouth  then closed it. What in the <i>hell</i> was he going to say to THAT  one? "Look, I just want ta make sure you're okay… I ain't  datin' her." He paused with her doubtful expression. "Come on,  'Kane. You gotta trust me one of these days."</p><p>Akane considered the  pigtailed boy in front of her and with him, everything they had been  through. "Alright, alright. So maybe I was being a little  unreasonable."</p><p>Ranma smiled. It was as  close to an apology and understanding as he was going to get. That  didn't make it any less important, however. "Fair enough. Don't  worry, we'll just handle her like all the other fiancées."</p><p>"God, I hope not."  Akane commented with amusement.</p><p>Ranma summoned a hurt  expression. "Hmmf! I see how it is." Then, with a smile, "I'm  gonna hit the bath. It's been a <i>long </i>day."  He stepped out  of the room and made his way down to the bath, absently noting the  lack of any 'occupied' markings. Sliding open the door, he  quickly found himself face to face with a extremely well endowed  woman who just happened to be his newest fiancée. Suds covered  her nude body as she rinced off under the cold water, and Ranma's  mentally plating took yet another armor piercing round. In other words,  he froze as his eyes began to transverse everything she had to  offer.</p><p>Which, incidentally,  was quite more than what Ranma was prepared for.</p><p>"Oh, um, hi Ranma."   Makoto Kashiwagi said with slight embarrassment, cheeks turning  a bit pink. One thing that was clear, however, was that see was quite  proud of her body. She stood up to pull the towel down to her,  affording Ranma a most excellent view of her—</p><p>Ranma's world  shattered.</p><p>Ample breasts: check.  Curvy hips: check. Beautiful eyes and pouty lips: Check-check. Male  organs where they really had no place being: Che—WHAT IN THE HELL?   Even as Ranma attempted to resolve this reality defying turn of  events, a presence approached from behind him.</p><p>"Ranma, I forgot to  tell you—" Whatever Akane was about to say was cut short as she  realized he was starring at a completely nude woman who was just  draping a towel around herself. "RANMA, YOU PERV—" The youngest  Tendo's eyes widened as she caught sight of the same thing her  fiancé had. Needless to say, she gaped. "You … She… He…  YOU'RE <b><i>BOTH</i></b> PERVERTS!" Somehow Akane found herself  unable to stomp off or hit Ranma this time, as if she were witness  to some horrible wreck that she just couldn't tear her eyes away  from.</p><p>"I can explain…"  The now covered Mako-chan offered, stepping over to the pair.  Unforunately, she stumbled on the bucket of cold water at her feet  and there was only one place for it to go. It hit Ranma, snapping the redhead  out of the trance enough to notice the curiosity now radiating from  her newest fiancée.</p><p>"Well, now, if <i>that</i>  isn't convenient…."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Yes it's true."  Mako-chan confirmed to family gathered around the dinner table, who  stared in awe. "Grandfather told me I should keep 'it' a secret  for this exact reason." She cast a sad look at Akane, who had taken  the place at the table furthest away from the new girl. The youngest  Tendo tried to rationalize it all. She acted like a girl, but had the  parts of both? She shivered slightly.<p>"A herma-  hermaphrodite?" A male Ranma stumbled over the word, to which  Mako-chan nodded.</p><p>"Technically, I'm  both sexes," She explained. "But I just consider myself fully  equipped!" She smiled at the last, then at Ranma. "And it would  appear that so are you."</p><p>"But I'm a GUY!"  Ranma protested, a point he'd made more times than he could count. Probably wouldn't be the last, either.</p><p>"…Who just happens  to be a girl half the time." Mako-chan's smile widened. "And I  just happen to be a girl who is both at the same time. It's  perfect!"</p><p>Kasumi ripped loose  with an "Oh my" while even Nabiki cocked her head at the logic.  "You <i>do </i>know there's a world of difference between the  two?" The middle Tendo pointed out.</p><p>"Not so much."  Makoto countered. "After all, we're both good for each other no  matter what form Ranma is in!"</p><p>The cursed martial artist in question suddenly had a desperate need  for fresh air.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"We have to stop  meeting like this, Son in-law." The wrinkled Elder stated from her  position across the table. She and Ranma now sat in Cologne's "safe  room", a space so magically warded that little- if anything -could  penetrate it to eavesdrop. Ranma hoped that included the The Meddler  as well. "Why so late, anyway?"<p>"I figure that's  either when she'll be asleep or won't suspect me to be up and  around." Ranma explained easily, to which Cologne arched an  eyebrow.</p><p>"She?" The Elder  latched on to the gender identity. "So your mysterious opponent is  a she, hmmm? Speaking of which, how is the Staff of Ascension  treating you?"</p><p>"Well, It was tough  at first, but—" Ranma stopped suddenly. "You <i>know</i>."</p><p>"Indeed, Son in-law."  The elder grinned. "I did not recognize you immediately on the  television… for obvious reasons." He frowned and the grin  widened. "But the Staff of Ascension is quite a legend amongst the  Amazons and tough to miss."</p><p>"Damn, I hope nobody  else picks up on that." Ranma shook his head at her accurate  deductions.</p><p>"I doubt it. Few know  of the individual staves themselves and even fewer the Staff. Of  those who do, most think that it is still in the possession of the  Phoenix tribe." The Amazon explained, unworried. "Still, it begs  the question… Why are you now in the company of the Sailor Senshi?  Or for that matter, how did you, of all people, become one?"</p><p>"Dammit, that's the  part I can't tell you." He grumbled and she studied the martial  artist intently.</p><p>"Then I'm afraid my  help will be quite limited."</p><p>Damn. Damndamndamn."  Ranma fussed, then looked her dead in the eye. "Fine. But you have  to swear what I tell you doesn't leave this room. I don't even  want it written in a report to the village or a journal, clear?"</p><p>Colognes eyes widened  slightly. He knew about the reports? "Clear, Son in-law."</p><p>"Her name is Sailor  Pluto."</p><p>Ranma couldn't have  surprise Cologne more if he tried. "Did you say… Pluto?"</p><p>"Yeah, why?" There  was no mistaking the reaction. The old mummy <i>knew</i> something.</p><p>"Because if this  Pluto and the one of Amazon legend are one in the same, she has been  meddling in Joketsuzoku affairs for thousands of years." Cologne growled.  "To what extent will probably never be known, but the name is not a  welcome one among the Elders." She paused, her eyes gaining an evil  glint. "This is your adversary?"</p><p>"Sounds like it."  He replied, surprised to see Cologne's emotional mask slip to such  a degree.</p><p>"What do you  propose?"</p><p>Now it was Ranma's  turn to pick up an evil grin. Anything Goes School of Payback, Step  Three. "Remember the 'Girl Away' powder we used on Happosai?"  She nodded. "I need something that <i>only</i> attracts the old fart."  Cologne's grin now matched Ranma's.</p><p>"The Joketsuzoku  Amazon's will be <i>more</i> than honored to provide whatever  assistance you require in this matter."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"OOOH HOHOHOHO!"  The sound rang out through the afternoon air, causing Ranma to freeze  instantly in his appointed task. "I have found you , Ranma-sama!"<p>Silently, Ranma praised  the Lord for her presence. "Ah, Ko-chan! It's so good to see  you!" The Hell froze over with those words.</p><p>"Of course it is, "  Kodachi replied with sweet arrogance. "And I must say that I do not  approve of your carousing with the Sailor strumpets." Then she  added. "Though you look quite fetching in that suit."</p><p>The martial artist face  planted into the ground. Why was it always the insane ones that could  see through the disguise? Regardless, the plan was still workable.  "Ya know, about that, Ko-chan… I wouldn't if it weren't for  that evil slave driver!"</p><p>"What?" Kodachi's  eyes began to glow. "The only one that will take a whip to my  Ranma-sama is me!"</p><p>Ranma twitched  nervously and began to wonder the wisdom of this particular plan.  "Uh, right… And she's the one forcing me to, er, 'carouse'  with the Senshi!"</p><p>"<i>She?"</i></p><p>Ranma smiled as his  explanation began to have the desired effect. "Yes… I would date you  if not for her plans for me…"</p><p>"<i>PLANS?"</i></p><p>"<i>Unspeakable</i>  plans." Ranma added, now thoroughly enjoying himself.</p><p>"This wench shall  fall by my hand!" Kodachi protests vehemently, chewing on her  ribbon. "Inform me as to this whores' name!"</p><p>"Would you like her  address as well?" Minutes later and information in hand, Kodachi  Kuno was off like a shot, allowing Ranma to return to his work.</p><p>"Heya Pops, have you  seen the old fart?"</p><p>Genma Saotome's eyes  widened and Soun Tendo's hands froze halfway through making his  move in their eternal shogi match. "Don't even<i> think </i>of him,  Boy!"</p><p>"He's Right Ranma!"  Soun agreed. "Such thoughts draw him forth."</p><p>"Feh, whatever." He  dismissed both parents with a shrug. "I need ta see him now."</p><p>"WHAT?" Both  parents where up now, staring in disbelief. "Don't you dare draw  the Master here! Besides, nobody knows where he's off to!"</p><p>"So you think me  saying his name will get him here?" Ranma asked and both parents  nodded with apprehension. Ranma smiled and took a deep breath.  <i>"Happosai! Happosai! Happosai!"</i></p><p>"Sweeto!" The  parents froze instantly, a horrified look plastered along their face.  The demon had been summoned. "Ranma, my boy! What's up?"</p><p>"I have something you  might like to know…" Ranma smiled.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"How would you like  to get yourself a hold of some <i>very</i> special magical girl  panties?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's notes</b>:  <i>Hooyah!
