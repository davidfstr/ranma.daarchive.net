</div><p><b>The Best of Times</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i><br/>A Fukufics (dotcom) Production</p><p><b>Epilogue X2</b></p><p><b>A</b> flattened three and a half foot long silver oval  sat peacefully atop the eight story high power converter recently  vacated by those whose sole goal was to destroy it and the source of  power floating above—an 8,000 pure heart crystal reactor feeding  humanities destruction. The manufacturing facility it supplied hadn't  come fully on line yet, but when it did, it would be capable of  producing over fifteen thousand youma a day, more than enough to send  a tide of destruction marching across the Earth.</p><p>The silver device sat unaware of the battle waging  around it as its main processor measured time in discreet electrical  pulses that flashed across a monofilament nervous system. Since the  unit's activation, it had measured two hundred and thirty nine of  these pulses, which in themselves were nothing special.</p><p>Pulse two hundred and forty, however, was a  notable exception.</p><p>The pulse hit the main processor and tripped a  special flag in the software, causing dormant systems to come online  and power up. The Elerium core at the center of the device came to  life and power began to funnel into the five anti-matter capacitors  surrounding it. In another sixty pulses, those capacitors would dump  their full potential into the core, initiating a catalyst that would  turn over two thousand miles of space into super heated plasma…</p><p>…or annihilate one pocket universe.</p><p>Pulse number two hundred and forty was noted and  marked by the weapon's processor as it completed its journey  through the maze of circuitry, activating another protocol.</p><p>"<i>Warning... Option to countermand has  expired." </i>The bomb spoke with ineffable calm.<i> "Countdown,  time minus one minute until detonation."</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i><br/>"Point of no return!" Mercury called out, one  kilometer down range from the last nuke of the Silver Millennium.  "One minute!"</p><p>Ranma Saotome, heir to the Anything Goes School of  Martial Arts considered his rapidly dwindling options as the  remainder of their strike team filed through the temporal gate held  open by Sailor Pluto. With well over ten thousand youma pressing  their lines, he was going to have to come up something fast, and that  something would have to be nothing short of a martial arts weapon of  mass destruction. Ranma ran down the list of his own techniques and  came up short, his most devastating special technique being a ki  borne tornado when she really needed a hurricane. In fact, the only  one that came close to having the power they needed to stay the  demonic advance was in Saturn, and they really weren't looking to  destroy the pocket universe with all of them inside.</p><p>Options… options… Beyond Sailor Pluto was  Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn, the final combatants chosen to hold the  line until a safe- hell, <i>any</i> –retreat through Setsuna's  gate could be organized… But they had cut their force to the bone,  evacuating everybody they could spare without being overrun in the  process, and now the girls were fighting just to maintain parity with  the opposing army. They were deadlocked and the clock was running  down.</p><p>The pig-tailed martial artist was the best of her  generation, and part of that ability came from her from a brain that  could devise tactics on the fly and under any situation. It was an  ability that had saved him and her friends more times than they would  care to admit, and now that formidable intellect chewed on the  current dilemma at terrifying speed, weighing the opposing force,  firepower needed to dispose of them, tools at her disposal, time  remaining and the necessary physics to pull off what was almost  certain to be a suicide move. She spared a moment, staring at the two  staves in her hands, one the embodiment of fire, the other ice. They  were elements she had all too much familiarity with, and Sailor Nova  new exactly what to do with them.</p><p>Sailor Nova fused the Gekkaja and Kinjakan back  together and stepped to the center of the defensive ring around the  wormhole, feeding power into the newly reformed staff. Ki flowed in a  circle from her, to it and back,as she twirled it wildly in  preperation for the ultimate technique that existed only in her minds  eye, up until now.</p><p>"<i>Hiryu..." </i></p><p>The razor ring snapped away, igniting as it took  flight. The Staff of Ascension continued to twirl in her hands, and  the guided ring spiraled outward, trailing super-heated air.</p><p>"<i>Shoten..."</i></p><p>The spiral continued to expand out beyond their  lines, and over the youma horde. The staff spun and Ranma focused  every ounce of ki into the technique. If it worked, it'd give Pluto  and herself the need breathing room to retreat themselves. If not...  Well, they'd both buy it in a spectacular fashion.</p><p>"<i>Ha..."</i></p><p>The twisting stopped and Ranma flipped the staff  around, its crescent blade facing downward. With a might heave, she  shoved the blade into the ground, turning it to ice for hundreds of  meters.</p><p>"ASCENSION!"</p><p>The shock wave ripped out from the staff and along  the super-heated line of atmosphere, uncoiling like the dragon Ranma  had unleashed so many times before. But now, those dragons seemed  like fence lizards compared to the one she had now loosed. Air  pressure and ki ripped outward beyond Nova , Pluto, and into the  waiting army of youma where it crushed them mercilessly. The shock  wave followed the heated spiral to the end and became self  sustaining, forming into a tempest the likes of which few had ever  seen. Saturn jumped through the portal, followed quickly by Mercury  and Jupiter. Nova held onto the ice embedded staff for dear life as  the winds threatened to rip her arms out of their sockets.</p><p>Ranma had known from the moment she felt the power  build she was more than likely a dead woman. There was no chance for  her to bridge the high pressure gap of super sonic wind separating  her from salvation. She managed a tear strew look and caught sight of  Pluto through the vapor and fog, seemingly standing against the  tempest from within her own bubble of serenity.</p><p>Her impassive face said it all.</p><p>There would be no salvation for the martial artist  and she could easily see the Senshi would make no move to help her.  Apparently the time-bitch would keep her word, and the only question  now was which would kill her first—The raging ki driven storm  around her or the nuclear fireball waiting to be unleashed one  kilometer away. The gale redoubled its efforts to tear her apart, and  she tightened her slipping grip on the staff.</p><p>No, if she was going down, it was gonna take the  blast from an ancient one gigaton super-weapon to do it.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Atop the plateau of the PHC converter, the ancient  super weapon in question sat peacefully, reflecting the pink light of  a construct that represented the slaughter of eight thousand people.  This fact was lost on the Elerium weapon of mass destruction, whose  central processor was preoccupied with counting the timing pulses  that measured its remaining function in seconds. Another specially  flagged pulse flashed across its monofilament circuitry, and the CPU  made final preparations to end its life.<p>"<i>Time minus ten seconds until detonation."  </i>The silver orb advised.<i> "Elerium core primed. Terminal  Protocols engaged. Final safeties released. Executing Defense of the  Realm in five… four… three…"</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i><br/>The Senshi-Nermian team that had driven the tip of  the spear home across two worlds watched the Pluto's dimentional  gate from Earth, just outside the Cherry Hill shrine. Mercury had the  planetary computer link open, receiving live telemetry from the other  end of the wormhole. The readings weren't good. In fact, they  sucked. She watched the timer tick down past the ten second mark and  noted the power spike across the link's display. The bomb was going  terminal and neither Ranma or Pluto had yet to step across the gate  boundry.</p><p>Five seconds.</p><p>Ami tore her eyes from the Mercury link and stared  desperately into the shimmering blue mass that represented a pathway  to another world. They had to make it back. Had to. They were the  good guys. The good guys always win. Even when they lose, they win.  Setsuna herself was damn near immortal while Yumei was a cast iron,  bullet proof bitch, even if she was a guy half the time. They just  had to-</p><p><b>PHoooMMP!</b></p><p>The porthole flashed and energy crackled away from  it wildly, as unrestrained lighning bolts skittered across the earth.  The gateway maintained its shape for a moment, then shuddered,  twisting in upon itself. Another pulse of light and the Pluto's  gateway glowed neon red before loosing cohesion entirely and wavered  out of existence. The only evidence that it had ever existed was the  black scoring across the ground and their memories.</p><p>A continues keening tone marked the event, causing  the others to look to Mercury for answers. The Senshi raised the  protesting PDA-like device and stared at the screen in mounting  horror. Across it read the words "transmission lost". Even as the  Sailors turned to her for answers, a soft gasp tore Moon's  attention from the shock-stricken Mercury and found Rei's eyes  riveted on Chibi.</p><p>"No…" Small Lady clutched her head, rocking  slowly back and forth. "It wasn't supposed to happen this way!"</p><p>Usagi blinked. Chibi was fading in and out of  reality, as if she were a mirage. "Chibi, what's happening to  you!" She rushed forward to anchor the pink haired girl, only to  find her hand pass clean through her shoulder. "Mercury, what the  hell!"</p><p>"Temporal distortion!" Mercury replied, panic  creeping back into her voice as she interpreted the new readings. "I  can't even get a time-space lock on her, Moon!"</p><p>"Chibi, stay with us!" Usagi pleaded, kneeling  next to her ghostly visage. Her subsequent attempts to grab at her  ended the same way the first had.</p><p>"It's all gone…!" The pink haired princess  gasped, as if the act of drawing a breath was becoming supremely  hard. "I can't remember…!"</p><p>Haruka spun around on Ami "Mercury, what  the hell is happening here!"</p><p>Sailor Mercury's fingers stabbed into the link,  their speed fuelled by desperation. "I told you, it's like she  not even there! Her phase readings are jumping all over the place!"</p><p>Moon turned back, facing Mercury with steeled blue  eyes. The Princess had arrived in full force. "I don't care what  it take, but you get her back—" The air shuddered softly, causing  Usagi to turn back to Chibi who now stood before her absolutely solid  in form. She couldn't hold the surprised gasp. "Mercury-!"</p><p>"I didn't do it." The Senshi cut her off  abruptly. "I don't know how the hell it happened, but she just  popped back into phase suddenly."</p><p>Cologne hopped into the circle of Senshi, trying  to discern what had happened to the young girl with her three hundred  years of human physiology expertise as a baseline. "Young Lady, are  you alright...?"</p><p>Her eyes were wide, stareing into the distance  without truly seeing anything. A single tear rolled down her face.  "No, I'm not." Her voice whispered in muted shock. "It's  never going to be okay again…"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Twelve dormant readings, one alpha." Sailor  Mercury reported as she interpreted the Mercury link's sensor  readings. The target of those readings lay in the tree line, and with  that information, Sailor Moon arrayed her forces accordingly.<p>"Venus, Jupiter, right flank." She directed in  a tone that meant she was all business. The two women nodded and took  their positions thirty meters off to her right, setting up for a  lethal ambush. Her fire team was in position.</p><p>Moon glaced sidelong to Mercury and nodded. The  cobalt haired girl returned it and keyed her fuku's imbedded  communications array. "Mars, now."</p><p>A fireball roared from a building behind the pair  and into the tree line, blowing it and several meters of earth apart  in a spectacular display of pyrotechnics. Another fireball streaked  in, pulverizing the razed mound revealed by the first detonation. A  plume of violent flame gouged the earth once again, showering the  area with fiery debris.</p><p>Moon's second in command smiled with internal  satisfaction as the readings within the hive began to shift  sporadically. Yeah, that rattled the bastards. "They're coming  out." Moon nodded once more and stared into what was left of the  burning tree line. Six months ago the Sailor Senshi had eliminated a  major threat to the Earth, that being a massive youma incursion from  a pocket universe. While they had succeeded in eliminating that  threat, there were still loose ends left wandering around, and those  loose ends had seen fit to entrench themselves in an attempt to  multiply.</p><p>Sailor Moon was dealing with one of those loose  ends right now.</p><p>The first youma climbed out of the smoldering  underground hive and the blond smiled. This is what the threat to  their world had been reduced to—Small masses of youma hiding  beneath the ground, fighting pre-programmed guerilla campaign against  them. She sniffed with contempt. Against the old Senshi, they might  have done so effectively. Sure, they would have still lost, but the  damage would have been extensive. Against the new Senshi, however…</p><p>"Venus, Jupiter, hold up." Mercury advised,  predicting Moon's own thoughts exactly. "Wait for the main  group." Sure enough, more youma boiled struggled out of the carnage  that had once been their makeshift base of operations. The battered  demons looked around through the smoke and ash, attempting to find  their tormenters. Sailor Moon and Mercury were the first people they  found, standing out in the open of the park grounds. Of course, there  was only one course of action that could be taken.</p><p>"<b>RROOOOoooOWWL!"</b></p><p>The cry went up in unison and a group of eight  youma charged Moon and Mercury. The cobalt blue-haired Senshi sighed,  almost bored, while Moon appeared to be examining her nails,  oblivious to the threat in front of her.</p><p>"Now?"</p><p>Usagi arched an eye brow and considered Ami's  question for a few precious moments while the mob advanced on them.  "Give them a few more seconds." Mercury shrugged, and watched the  short platoon rush closer, claws and jaws snapping in hurried time.</p><p>"Let's not grandstand too much, your  Highness." She advised as their line drew within fifty meters.  "Still got the big one to take care of."</p><p>Usagi sighed. After a pocket universe full of  monsters worse than this, it almost seemed anti-climatic. "Now."</p><p>"<i>Waste 'em."</i></p><p>The response to Mercury's order was  instantaneous. There was no call to attack. No fancy dances or  sounding out special techniques. One moment there was peace and  silence along the youma's right flank, then there was a Venus Love  Me Chain ripping through it, tearing into it like a golden buzz saw.  Three of the demons were cut down instantly and the advance faltered  as the survivors desperately tried to find the source of the ambush.  The chaos created by Venus was so complete that the remaining force  failed to see the ball of compressed thunder fall into their ranks,  detonating with cataclysmic results. Another two youma at ground zero  were crushed into a fine paste as the over-compressed shockwave  swallowed them up and proceeded to maim the survivors. Two more were  savaged, leaving one combat functional demon alone amidst the  destruction. The golden chain of death descended upon it and the  platoon of youma ceased to exist.</p><p>The orange and green fuku'd women affected an  unhurried stroll past the carnage they had wrought seconds before,  joining Moon and Mercury.</p><p>"Well that was weak." Venus commented, looking  at the pair. "Don't tell me Mars managed to take out the others  when she opened up?"</p><p>Mercury shook her head. "Don't worry. Three  more left." Jupiter squinted into the ruined tree line, and the  lifeless cratered mound therein. "They're still digging  themselves out. In fact, they should be surfacing right about…"</p><p>"<b>BWWRAAaaaaWWLL!"</b></p><p>"…Now." Mercury smiled, tapping on the link  like clockwork.</p><p>"Uh, guys…" Jupiter took a step back as the  three youma dug themselves from the wreckage of their former hive. It  wasn't the two ugly pink youma with tails and horns that caused her  to take a double take. She instinctively knew they would go down like  wet tissue paper. It was the three story tall mass of fangs and  scales that had her attention.</p><p>"Huh." Ami stated blandly, coaxing more data  out of the PDA. "Didn't see that one coming."</p><p>"'It's freaking huge' is what you mean!"  Venus protested. Even as it marched forward, one of its surviving  brethren strayed to close to it and was squashed beneath a giant pink  hoof.</p><p>Moon winced. "Ouch."</p><p>The monster youma before them took a step forward  and they took a step back. Mercury clicked the clamshelled link  closed and prepped for battle. "It's one of the siege youma.  Energy blasts, super strength, the whole nine yards."</p><p>"Right." Sailor Moon replied, her memory  sufficiently jogged. They had named the monstrously large youma from  the other dimension 'seige youma', as their primary purpose  seemed to be to anchor any youma incursion with its massive firepower  and strength. In fact, she was loathing the fact that they didn't  have a Mishma Heavy Industries gunship handy to deal with it.  "Semi-circle, on me. Don't bunch up." She paused, opening a  channel to Mars. "Rei, light it up so we can get in close."</p><p>"With pleasure." The disembodied voice  replied, and the top of a building two blocks away flashed to life.  From it, the third fireball since the start of the engagement tore in  and smacked into the Siege youma like a flaming hammer. The explosion  incinerated the last remaining youma regular and stuck to its larger  cousin like napalm. Its advance halted with the howl of pain just as  another bolt tagged it, causing it to thrash around furiously.</p><p>"<b>NOW!"</b></p><p>All four Senshi were in motion, attacking the  monster from different direction simultaneously. Moon's golden  tiara cut through one of four arms while Jupiter's Supreme thunder  attempted to punch a hole through it's backbone armor. Venus  stepped in and her Love Me Chain raked its hooved leg. A horizontal  pillar of water followed the attack courtesy of Mercury, freezing the  leg in place within a jagged icy block. Mars' flaming attacks died  out and the beast seemed to regain some composure, sending a bright  blue energy bolt after Venus. The blast missed, but the shockwave  hammered her into the ground as a plume of supernatural fire rose  into the mid-day sky. Moon's attention was diverted just long  enough to miss the next energy blast with her name on it. The  monsters other free arm extended and the bolt seem to reach out and  grab her, plunging her consciousness into a world of pain. The blast  slammed her into the earth and used her face to create a trench  thirty meters long, before coming to a smoldering stop.</p><p>Moon pushed herself up, only to find the Siege  Youma having broken free of Mercury's ice trap and shambling  towards her. The other Sailors were all around it, doing damage, but  not fast enough to deter the beast from it's single minded focus on  ripping her apart. All four arms seemed to glow, and if she didn't  know any better, the youma's face produced a fanged-filled smile.</p><p>"Oh shit…"</p><p>Huge blue balls of power coalesced in each hand  and the youma wound-up, readying the energy torrent to launch. Usagi  knew what was going to happen next, and it was going to <i>hurt. </i>The  arms came back and—</p><p>"<i>Dead Scream."</i></p><p>A pink ball of energy tore through the siege  youma, taking with it a large chunk of flesh, bone and other vital  organs. The blue energy in its hands disappeared abruptly and the  demon fell to its spiked knees in agony.</p><p>"Dead scream?" Sailor Moon mouthed. There was  only one Senshi she knew of that would use that attack, and if she  was alive, then it meant… Her eyes found her savior balanced  lightly atop a telephone pole, and her thought process halted  abruptly. She recognized the black and white fuku immediately.  Everything after that, however, crushed reality as she knew it.</p><p>The woman was a far cry from Pluto's five foot  seven height, barely topping five two herself. Instead of the flowing  green hair, an impossibly bright red mane floated with the daytime  breeze. No. No way. No way in <i>hell</i> could that be… The new  Senshi appeared not to notice her or the other Sailors gaping as she  flipped gracefully off the pole and landed within a few meters of the  siege youma, who was trying to recover from having a quarter of its  mass forcibly removed. The woman stepped in and waited for the  massive creature to notice her. After a few seconds, a beady, sunken  eyeball finally found her and raised a huge claw in response, ready  to shred the source of its anguish. The massive fist of flesh came  down and was intercepted by the point of her staff; a half moon blade  that promptly turned the youma's entire arm to ice on contact. Its  beady little eyes mirrored Moon's own expression, widening as she  flipped the weapon around almost lazily and removed the appendage;  the opposite ringed blade tip cutting through the ice. A violent  geyser of steam accompanied the act, and the arm fell to the earth  where it promptly shattered into a few thousand pieces.</p><p>A state of shock existed within the monster's  limited thought process, allowing the redhead a moment to admire her  handiwork before looking back up into the youma's eyes, waiting for  its next move. The Senshi didn't have long to wait. The demon had  three remaining arms and it put them all to work in a simultaneous  strike that was sure to hit her. At least that's what it thought.  The Sailors too.</p><p>It didn't.</p><p>Her form blurred into a streak of red and the  staff whirled around, carving the arms off at their elbows. Two went  down as blocks of ice while the third in scorching flame. The blur  subsided and the only evidence that the Senshi had even moved was her  settling red hair.</p><p>"Is that it?" She asked rhetorically and now  it was the youma who took a step back. "Nah, don't think so."  She raised a hand it glowed with power. "Moko Takabisha revised… <i>Chrono</i> Takabisha."</p><p>A shivering blue ball floated from the  outstretched hand and into the armless youma. For a moment, nothing  happened, then the youma itself shuddered and screamed, hitting the  ground and proceeded to twitch violently.</p><p>"What the hell did she hit him—" Mercury was  asking as she pulled Moon up from her trench, when the entire three  story tall youma began to fold in upon itself. Its chest cavity  crumbled as bone splintered, and with one final waver of light, the  demon was gone. The remaining Senshi gathered around the redhead and  stared in total disbelief while she gazed into the space the monster  had just been forcibly evicted.</p><p>"R-Ranma?" Sailor Moon asked with trepidation,  reaching out to touch the woman to ensure she actually did exist. Her  probing fingers found the shoulder solid and a smile broke out across  her face. It was a smile of joy and relief; however it failed to move  Ranma, who continued to stare into space.</p><p>"If Ranma's alive…" Rei began softly,  coming to the only logical conclusion available to her, minus any of  the facts. It was the same one that Usagi and the others came to.  Ranma made it. So had Setsuna. Somehow, against all odds…</p><p>"Setsuna is alive too…?" Ami forwarded the  largely rhetorical question. The answer was obvious. The good guys  always—</p><p>"No."</p><p>Time skipped a beat as the word was processed by  the Senshi surrounding Ranma. "But…"</p><p>Ranma turned to Usagi for the first time since  their meeting, confronting her directly. There was no emotion in her  voice as she spoke her next words. "Setsuna Meiou is dead."</p><p>"Pluto is... Dead?" Makato repeated, as if  unable to believe the statement.</p><p>"No." Ranma corrected in the same, emotionless  voice. "<i>Setsuna</i> is dead."</p><p>"But…" Now everybody was confused and Usagi  was getting a very bad feeling about where all this was going.</p><p>"Setsuna didn't make it," She continued. "But I'm Ranma  Saotome, Guardian of Time and the last Princess of Pluto."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Usagi stared at the girl sitting across from her,  and the words coming out of her mouth just didn't make any sense.  If being dead wasn't enough, there was no way she could have  carried the mantle of Pluto. While her Sailor Nova persona would  always be fondly remembered, she was neither a real sailor or  reincarnated. Her fuku had been a costume, not real armor. The only  thing real about Nova was her martial arts ability and the staff she  bore, which <i>was</i> a relic from the Silver Millennium. Now here  she was in the shrine, not only alive, but claiming Setsuna was dead  and she had taken her place.<p>"Not buying it." Haruka stated from across the  room, staring icy daggers into the red head. "In fact, we oughta  beat you within an inch of your miserable life for impersonating our  friend."</p><p>Ranma's eyes slowly found Uranus and stared  back, matching the icy glare but saying nothing. Moon shivered. This  wasn't the Sailor Nova she had met. No snappy comebacks. No  issuance of challenge. Just silent, ominous <i>threat</i>.</p><p>"That dead scream she let loose was the real  deal." Ami inserted. "Pulled the sensor log. Aside from the minor  variations in quantum flux the energy signatures match with a Senshi  of Pluto."</p><p>"A trick." Michiru pointed out, though in a  far less certain tone than partner.</p><p>"You'd like a demonstration." Ranma stated  in calm voice, finally turning her attention to the pair of outers.  "Sailor Nova was a fake. I can assure that this—" She triggered  the transformation and the pink glow around her called the black and  white fuku armor forth. "—is the real thing."</p><p>She pulled the Staff of Ascension out of weapons  space and Usagi couldn't help but to stare… That wasn't the  same weapon she remembered Ranma wielding. The differences started at  the crescent blade, its reverse edge notched at precise angles. The  shaft of the stave was also notched with precise, angular teeth that  prevented a smooth level down the first half of its length. The end  ring seemed unchanged, save the glowing, blood red crystal floating  at its center.</p><p>"And I had almost thought I'd never get a-"  Uranus' words were cut off abruptly as a subtle gust erupted around  her, accompanied by the ice cold feeling of steel at her neck. The  Senshi of Uranus dared not move, staring into the empty space Ranma  had just occupied. It didn't take a genius to realize who was  holding the blade to her neck now.</p><p>"Rematch, 'Ruka-chan?" The low whisper  tickled her ear. "I'd drop you in a heartbeat if it weren't for  all the fond memories I have of you."</p><p>At any other time, the situation might have been  an extreme turn on. A beautiful woman pressed to her back, whispering  in her ear…That might have even been the intention, but the cold  edge that threatened to vent a major artery kept Haruka firmly rooted  to reality.</p><p>The remaining Senshi stared. Ranma hadn't moved.  They were positive of that fact. Every single one of them knew that  the martial artist was pre-naturally quick, but this registered on an  entirely different level. One moment she had been there, the next,  gone.</p><p>"Time stop." Ami said, consulting her Mercury  link. "No movement recorded, but there are definite signs of  temporal displacement."</p><p>The blade lowered from Haruka's throat and she  bolted away, spinning around. "You can't do that! That's a  suicide move!" Ranma frowned. It was probably the most emotion she  had displayed since her arrival.</p><p>"For Setsuna, it was."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Princess Pluto squinted across the twenty foot  distance that separated her from Ranma Saotome. Leaping the gap from  the ice imbedded staff to the porthole would be all but impossible,  even for a martial artist of Ranma's caliber, and the only reason  she herself hadn't been swept away by the mach two gale was the  time space bubble she resided in. "Sailor Nova" had no such  respite, and the very tempest she unleashed was battering her  mercilessly. Pluto couldn't help but to note the sickening irony.  After all the work she had put into removing the boy as a threat, he  went and removed himself.</i><p>…<i>And saved all their asses in the process.</i></p><p><i>That particular fact didn't sit well with the  Senshi. She had done a good many things in her life and lay through  many sleepless nights because of them, but she had developed a high  tolerance to guilt. Her job was to safeguard the Senshi and insure  the survival of humanity in the process. All in all, it was one hell  of a rationalization that allowed her to do any number of very nasty  things in the name of love and justice. Part of her wanted to say  this was just another step down that bloody path. Ranma would go down  by fire or ice and Setsuna would go home, get blasted on sake and do  it all over again the next day. The other part of her… There was a  quiet rebellion taking place in Setsuna's mind. What right did she  have to take the life of somebody who so willingly marched into the  fire, knowing that there was a good chance that they wouldn't be  coming back? A person who had the same mentality as she did—Doing  whatever it took to safe guard the future of the world she loved?</i></p><p><i>But instead of taking other peoples lives to do  it, Ranma Saotome, soon to be dead heir to the Anything Goes School  of Martial had given his own..</i></p><p><i>Could she really do it again? Could she murder  another fellow patriot so willingly? And what did that say about her?  Would she do the same to Ami? Maybe Rei? If it came down to it, would  she remove one of her own team from existence to secure the near  impossible dream? The answer sickened her and in that moment,  Setsuna Meiou knew what she had to do. Oblivion reached out to snatch  the martial artist with a flash of light and Setsuna unsheathed the  time key one last time.</i></p><p>"Jikan yo Tomore."</p><p><i>The hypervelocity storm raging around her  ground to a halt, and even the blast wave rushing for them froze in  its ferocious expansion. Sailor Pluto stepped from the safety  provided by the gate's rift and into a universe rapidly draining of  color. She moved through the curtains of mist and vapor over to  Ranma, whose life and death struggle against the forces she wrought  were reduced to a single frame floating in time. Setsuna looked the  fuku'd warrior up and down, noting every painful line etched in her  face, the strain in her muscles against a phantom wind. </i></p><p><i>The Guardian of time nodded with approval. If  she was to give her life for another, then better it be to somebody  who would fight until they had breathed their last, and then some.  Setsuna extended her staff once more, noting the darkening reality  around her. You can't fight time forever, she thought ruefully and  touched the cursed martial artist with the heart tip. Sailor Nova  began to glow softly, gaining intensity with unnatural shimmer. Her  body was enveloped and the light peaked and vanished, leaving nothing  behind but the form of a martial artist that once was. The world  around Setsuna continued to darken and burn away like an over-exposed  negative.</i></p><p>"<i>Forgive me, Ranma-kun, it was the best I  could do." She sighed, lowering the time key to her side. Time  continued to crumble in upon itself, dissolving into a mass of  formless shadows until only a small space around her person remained  lit. </i></p><p><i>And it was there Setsuna Meiou, Guardian of  Time and the Last Princess of Pluto finally found her peace.</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i><br/>"To the time gates?" Usagi queried as Ranma  powered down from Senshi mode and back into the her civilian dress,  which consisted of loose red slacks, a black silk blouse and jacket,  complementing the long unbound mane of bright red hair.</p><p>Ranma nodded, taking another sip of tea with the  pause in their discussion. "It was the only place she could send  me, having frozen our original escape route in time."</p><p>"But shouldn't you have just…" Ami asked  tentatively, stepping lightly across the subject of death, especially  when it involved opening so many old wounds for everyone involved.</p><p>"Died?" Ranma let a slight smile cross her  face. Moon noticed more emotion trickle back into her friend the  longer she was around them. "Setsuna was bound by that protocol,  not I."</p><p>"You <i>changed</i> Queen Serenity's  protocols?" Michiru mouthed, eyes widening. Behind her, Haruka  remained silent, but glaring, still nursing her bruised ego.</p><p>"Not exactly." She smiled warmly, and for a  moment, the Senshi of Neptune could have sworn it had come from  Setsuna. "The Queen's protocols were specifically written for  Setsuna Meiou. There's no way she could have foreseen somebody  taking her post in the manner I did."</p><p>"And how was that?" Haruka questioned, with a  trace of hostilitiy. Still it was magnitudes less than what had  erupted earlier.</p><p>"The wish."</p><p>The girls looked at Ranma with blank expressions,  and the redhead suppressed a sigh, knowing she was going to have to  recount the entire sordid tale. "About nine months ago, I came into  possession of a sword that granted wishes."</p><p>"Sword?"</p><p>"Wishes?"</p><p>"No way."</p><p>Ranma smirked and Usagi watched the tide of  personality change from something that resembled the mysterious  Setsuna to the roguish Ranma. "Any more impossible than a gender  shifting martial artist?" That shut them all up. "Anyway, I made  a wish… To know why I could never get a moment's peace. As it  turned out, Setsuna was behind that particular aspect of my life and  I found out far more than I ever wanted to know about her."</p><p>"How much..?" It was a new voice and Ranma  turned to find the pink hair of Chibi Usa. Suddenly, the red head was  at a loss for words as a full head of emotion rushed to the  forefront. Everybody in the room could see it, and was wondering just  how the child had affected her so. Whatever she was feeling it  obviously wasn't pleasant.</p><p>"<i>Everything."</i></p><p>Moon glanced from Ranma to Chibi, wondering what  the connection was. With the presumed deaths of Ranma and Setsuna six  months ago, the child had lapsed into a depressive state that was  totally at odds with her usual, bubbly personality. Any assurances  that everything would be okay died the moment she began to fade from  existence, and it was only through later analysis- much of it Ami's  –did they realize the probable cause. It had happened once before,  and it meant that some key component had been removed from the girl's  future. That component, Ami had figured, was Setsuna. Without the  Senshi to bring her back in time<i> to</i> them, Chibi became the  focus of a paradox- a concept Usagi herself barely understood –and  began to fade from existence. In fact, she was still at a loss to  explain why Chibi was even still alive.</p><p>What had become obvious was the source of the  girl's anxiety and mounting depression… Whatever had happened,  her entire future was built on quicksand. Without a Sailor Pluto, she  couldn't go back to the parent she knew. In fact, the world as she  knew it no longer existed without the lynchpin named Setsuna Meiou.  Her parents. Family. Friends. Even her childhood had been erased in  favor of a new future.</p><p>"Puu?" It was a meek whisper, one mixed with  hope, longing and sadness in equal measure. It surprised everybody in  the room to see Ranma kneel down to her level and open her arms.</p><p>"Come, child."</p><p>Small Lady needed no further prompting, and  slammed into Ranma like a freight train of tear, no longer holding  back the emotion she had held at bay for the past six months.  "They're gone, Puu, they're gone! Every last one of them!"</p><p>Ranma pulled the child tighter into her, stroking  her hair as she cried into her shoulder. "I know, Chibi… I know…"</p><p>The sobbing continued unabated. "Mom, Dad…  'Kira-kun… Auntie Setsuna … You… All gone!"</p><p>The Senshi watched the scene with morbid  fascination as Chibi Usa cried in Ranma's arms as if she were a  long time friend. Even more surprising was Ranma's unabashed  acceptance of the child, as she tenderly stroked the tearful pink  haired girl.</p><p>"I won't leave you, Chibi…" Ranma  whispered into her ear, and the sniffling girl seemed to regain some  composure. "Not <i>ever</i>."</p><p>She waited a moment longer as Chibi Usa took the  promise to heart, wiping the tears from her eyes. Ranma stood up,  looking fondly down at the girl one last time before turning back to  the others, who stared with questions radiating from their being, but  were to polite to ask. She decided to dispense with formalities.</p><p>"You all know what happened to Chibi six months  ago." She began, and the group around her nodded. While the exact  nature of temporal mechanics remained a mystery to most of those  present, the effects weren't. "When Setsuna stopped time to save  me, she unwittingly created a paradox in which Chibi here couldn't  have come back in time, since there was now literally nobody to do  it. She died and set into motion a temporal cascade that nearly  removed Chibi from time. Had I not acted, none of you would even  remember she existed."</p><p>"You acted?" Ami's ears perked up. She had  been one of the few in the room who understood the full implications  of Chibi's paradox and was now being offered an explanation as to  why the girl didn't disappear outright.</p><p>Ranma nodded. "I manipulated the Time Gates and  anchored Chibi to this timeline. It let her continue to exist, but  the price was… high. She's now an independent element within the  flow of time. As such, everything she knew- her past and our future  –is gone." A sniffle from Chibi punctuated the statement, and she  clinged tighter to Ranma, who in turn let her hand flow through the  child's pink hair.</p><p>Rei spoke up, raising a hand tentatively as if she  were in class and talking to the teacher, which was odd, since Ranma  was carrying herself like one. One of the better ones, she noted  absently. Calm and patient. "But can't you just… Return her  back to the future? Like Setsuna was going to?"</p><p>"No." Ranma shook her head slowly. "With  Setsuna's death, the future has been rewritten. If I were to return  Chibi to the future, she would find another in her place. While some  of it might be similar, a lot has changed with my predecessor's  death."</p><p>"So you're saying there'll be <i>two</i>  Chibi's eventually?" Michiru fidgeted with a strand of her  luscious green hair. Her mind trying to wrap itself around the new  possibility.</p><p>Ranma cast a sidelong glance over to Usagi.  "Assuming certain outcomes come to pass, yes." The blond  instantly began to glow bright pink, her eyes shifting around  nervously.</p><p>"So you're Setsuna now." Haruka pressed, her  voice laden with disbelief. Miraculously, all traces of its former  venom had vanished.</p><p>"No." Ranma frowned. It was obviously not the  most pleasant subject for her to discuss. "As I said, the wish  granted me knowledge as to why I could never have a moment's peace.  The sword fulfilled that wish literally, giving me awareness as to  Setsuna and her plans regarding me. I thought that was the extent of  the wish. Simple awareness. I knew who Setsuna was, her Senshi  identity and a fair amount of minutiae."</p><p>"I had no idea just how wrong I was."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>The void. </i><p><i>Ranma paced the void once again, casting a  baleful glare at its only other occupant, two huge, intricately  carved double doors. What day was it again? They had lost their names  early on in her stay and had since been regulated to numbers. Today's  day was number fifty eight. Maybe. There was no day or night in the  void, making it all but impossible to accurately measure time. </i></p><p>"<i>What time is it?" The doors considered the  question and responded in silence. Ranma fumed, mumbling something  about the doors and their questionable linage. Halfway through her  litany of curses, Ranma stopped short, realizing that she was holding  a conversation with a door. Not good. Almost as bad as that time when  I sacked Egypt, she thought with amusement. The plague of locus had  been especially—</i></p><p>"<i>AHHHHAAARRR!" the scream echoed across  the endless night, and the redhead fell to her knees. "Get out of  my head!" Ranma sent a fist into the insubstantial surface she was  kneeling on, only to have it softly intercepted by a counter force.  The nullification of her attempt at physical violence only fueled her  anger, and she whipped around, glaring at the double doors. "Oh,  you just think this is SO funny, don't you!" the doors remained  silent. "Fucking doors! Moko Takabisha!"</i></p><p><i>The ki shot covered the small distance at near  light speeds, flashing into the doors and ablating across their  surface with a loud crack of energy. Ranma glared at the structure.  As usual, they had come through the abuse absolutely unscathed. It  pissed her off to no end. She pulled the Staff of Ascension from  weapons space and rushed them, wedging the crescent bladed edge into  the center seam. She shifted her leverage hard right and attempted  pry the double doors open with everything she had, an attempted that  last only ten minutes as neither the staff nor doors yielded to her  pressure.</i></p><p>"<i>Alright, fine." The martial artist  growled. He stepped away from the doors, gaining distance. "If  that's the way you wanna play it, have it your way! DEAD SCREAM!"</i></p><p><i>Silence greeted the technique and Ranma stood  by in incomprehension. That should have worked. She stared at her  hands wondering why a pink ball of death hadn't erupted from them  to smash the doors to smoldering ash. She was about to reposition  herself for another attempt when horrible realization desended upon  her.</i></p><p><i>The was </i>her<i> technique.</i></p><p><i>Ranma stared at her hands. "What the hell is  happening to me!" She gasped, alone in the night. "I ain't  her!" She took deep breaths and tried to calm herself, settling  into a crouch. If this was Setsuna's idea of a practical joke, it  really wasn't funny anymore. Not by a long shot. How long is she  going to keep her locked up? Years? Is this her solution to removing  me as a threat to Crystal Tokyo? Somehow, the answer came up as a  negative for Ranma. She was getting to know the green haired woman  all to well and it didn't strike her as something Pluto would do.  After all, these were the Time Gates. You wouldn't leave a  potential advesary— Ranma's thoughts paused again, staring at the  double doors and the staff imbedded in their seam. </i></p><p><i>So that's what they are.</i></p><p><i>Ranma hopped up from her crouch with renewed  purpose, and strode over to the doors. Her hand closed around the  staff and pulled it from the seam, returning it back to weapons  space. Time Gates. Ranma knew she shouldn't have known that.  Couldn't have known that. But she did, and it unnerved her. She ran  a finger down the unmarred seam and across the intricate carvings.  The touch was accompanied by another flash of insight… the first  time she had laid eyes on them. The Queen was at her side, showing  her… The martial artist squeezed her eyes shut, and shook her head  free of the vision. She broke contact with the gates and stepped away  from them as if they were a threat. She knew they weren't of  course, but the visions… no, not visions, she decided. Memories.</i></p><p><i>Setsuna's memories.</i></p><p><i>It had taken over a month to come to that  conclusion, but it was the only one Ranma could come with. She had  been seeing things through the woman's eyes. Feeling them. And it was  getting worse. With the familiar surroundings, the memories had  started to flow into her brain at a faster pace. Coupled with the  near total sensory deprivation of the time gate void, and the brain  was very receptive to input. How she was even still alive after over  a month without water was beyond the pigtailed girl, but that was the  least of her concerns at the moment. Keeping her sanity was, and was  becoming increasingly harder to separate her memories from Pluto's.</i></p><p>"<i>Ok, think…" Ranma prodded herself aloud.  "Why the hell is this happening…?" She had had plenty of time  to think on the matter and there was only one thing she could  attribute the memories to… "That damn wish…" She growled. The  sword had evidentially taken her quite literally, not simply  identifying and knowing the source of her angst, but knowing  everything about her, right down to the woman's life experiences…  all three thousand, five hundred and sixty three years of them. The  normal human memory knew decay. Very few people would recall their  entire life experience, and even fewer over three thousand years of  it. Chunks of it would be reduced to vague impressions, fond  recollections and the like. Ranma's wish knew no such limitations,  however and it was all getting squeezed into her brain like an  over-stuffed package. Not instantly, mind you, but just fast enough  not to kill her outright.</i></p><p><i>Ranma's mind found another unpleasant topic  to dwell on… Like how the hell she was going to get out before she  went insane, between the memories and near sensory deprivation. The  void had no sound, no real light save the glow of the doors. Nothing  to feel, let alone taste. The redhead stared at the Time Gates once  again. She knew what they were. Now all she had to do was get them to  work before she broke. </i></p><p><i>No, she decided. Ranma Saotome, never loses.</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i><br/>"Three thousand…" Hotaru breathed, sitting  on the edge of the sofa as Ranma recounted the tale. Ranma nodded  silently from her kneeling position on the floor, Chibi Usa wrapped  possessively around her as if the redhead herself were a lifeline.</p><p>"I remember everything that she was." Ranma  spoke softly. "Hell, I even remember bringing the lil Spore here  back in time to you guys." Slight shock registered on Chibi's  face as she jerked up to look at Ranma, finding a warm smile. A  little smile pierced her cloudy depression and she tightened her grip  tightened around the redhead. "Make no mistake however, I am <i>not</i>  her. I battled long and hard with those memories. They threatened to  swallow me up… I mean, what is eighteen years as you versus three  thousand as somebody else? The line blurs."</p><p>"I'm sure it does…" Ami whispered. Like  Usagi next to her, she had been watching as traces of Setsuna ripple  across Ranma's personality. But she was right. There was an  undeniable difference. She was neither the Ranma they knew nor the  Setsuna of old. This amalgam carried herself with confidence, yet  retained the cloak of calm mystery.</p><p>"…So you won't have to worry about me  sneaking up on you any time soon, Princess." The mischievous smile  grew and Usagi readily identified it as Ranma's. "Now 'Ruka and  Michi-chan on the other hand…"</p><p>"You say that like you know us." Haruka stated  flatly while her partner kept her expression neutral.</p><p>"That's my point." Ranma offered guilessly.  "Everything Setsuna knew about you, I know. Which is why I've  tabled any feud we may have had in the past. I… <i>she</i>  remembers you both too fondly for me to hold that sort of grudge."</p><p>Haruka blinked. It was true… They had all been  close friends, but… Uranus further speculation on the matter was  cut short by the click of the front door and the entry of a lean  woman with long black hair clad in a blue happi and black tights. The  leather bandolier and giant combat spatula slung around her back  identified her to the Senshi immediately.</p><p>"Tell me you saved some snacks for…" Ukyo's  voice trailed off as her eyes fell upon Ranma, and her breath seemed  sucked away by an invisible force of nature. "…me…" She stood  there for several long seconds before her something close to a  coherent thought formed in her mind. <i>"...Ranma!"</i></p><p>Ranma's eyes widened as she stood up slowly. She  had known that her child hood friend had been hanging out with the  Senshi, but to have her just suddenly appear… She recovered from  her initial shock and Ukyo watched as her face closed up into serene  mystery, content, unrevealing in its nature. "Hello, Uccha—OOF!"</p><p>A second train of tears ran headlong into her,  nearly running over Small Lady in order to get to the red headed  Senshi. "You're not dead? How in the hell—no wait! I don't  care! I don't give a <i>damn!</i> Just tell me this isn't a  dream, Ran-chan!"</p><p>Ranma smiled and wrapped her arms around her  oldest friend. "If it's a dream, it's pretty sick and perverse.  Either way, it's... It's good to see you, Ucchcan."</p><p>They held the embrace for several minutes before  Ukyo untangled herself from Ranma, looking her over for the first  time since his death. Or <i>her</i> death, she revised, taking in her  friend and fiancées current fashion. More telling was the  hair, which was now an unbound mane of long red hair. She knew the  person across from her like the back of her hand, and several key  pieces of logic instantly snapped into place. First the hair. Ranma  just didn't let it get that long unless it was part of some ruse.  Second, the fashion. While it wasn't frilly, it was definitely  feminine in nature and the styling left more than enough room for  combat mobility, she appraised. Finally, came the way she held  herself. Beyond the hair, it was the most striking change of all. The  other two elements could have been attributed to Ranma and the games  that tended to surround him, but the way she held herself now was  totally un-Ranma. She was confident, yet reserved. Even mysterious.  It wasn't the cocky stance she had grown so used to seeing, no  matter what form he wore.</p><p>The red headed Guardian of Time noticed Ukyo's  appraisal and nodded. "Yes, there's been a few changes."</p><p>"The curse?" It wasn't a question any of the  Senshi had bothered to ask given their lack of familiarity with  Ranma's daily life, but Ukyo was seeking a reason for the change  and it was the first most logical question to ask.</p><p>"Unlocked." Ranma kept her expression  carefully neutral, knowing what was coming next.</p><p>"Whew." Ukyo relaxed. "I thought the change  was permanent for a moment there."</p><p>"It is." The Okanomiyaki master blinked. "It's  been a hard road getting back here, Uuchan…"</p><p>Her mind processed the implications and everything  that came with it. Ranma's guarded expression helped solidify the  conclusion she came to. He was a she and she was staying that way for  a reason. It also meant the engagement—all of them –were more  than likely dead. Ukyo took a deep breath and sighed, then settled on  a smile that was totally at odds with what Ranma had been expecting.</p><p>"That's not important now." She decided. "What is, is that  you're alive to tell me all about it."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<i>Pan left, eight degrees." Ranma directed,  and the image in front of her rotated left at a lethargic pace. It  was a rainy day she was watching, and everyone was in black with  matching umbrellas. Kinda fitting, she mused. "Wide angle. Give me  fifteen meters AGL. Z-minus five." The scene pulled out, allowing  the view of the entire scene. She chuckled as Ryoga Hibiki came into  view. Ryoga in a suit and tie. It doesn't get much better than  that. Shampoo was all decked out, while her grandmother was flanked  by an Amazon ceremonial honor guard. Nice touch. Even better was the  wary glances they were shooting at the Musk honor guard across the  isle, with Herb as their ambassador. Baby Saffron, Kira and the  Phoenix were simply icing on the cake after that. The redhead stifled  another chuckle, as if they'd somehow be able to hear her through  the opened double doors.</i><p><i>All in all, it was pretty funny considering it  was her funeral they were all attending.</i></p><p><i>That, and the images she was watching play out  were about three months old, now. The martial artist watched for a  few minutes longer, noting that it wasn't quite as good as Ceasar's  funeral. Now that was a—Ranma paused, grinding her teeth in  irritation. Not my memory, not my memory, mot my memory, she clenched  a fist, burning the mantra into her head. While it was a small  victory to have successfully caught the mental trespass, she knew for  every foreign memory she caught, five more normally slid past  unnoticed. Of course, unlike Ceasar, she was still alive, so he was  welcome to the larger funeral. Ranma shook her head and turned her  attention back to the Time Gates. Speaking of Setsuna…</i></p><p>"<i>Date, April 11th, 1990. Time:  10:30am. 35 by 40 by 49 point 13 north, 139 by 43 by 43 point 27  east, execute."</i></p><p><i>The scene she had been watching flashed away to  a different location thirteen miles south of Nerima, floating high  above a small graveyard. "Ten meters AGL at forty-five degrees,  z-minus eight." The gates obeyed the command, dropping from aloft  and settling in on another funeral, this one much smaller than the  last she visited. Eight girls stood around a single plot, their dress  varying wildly with each individual. Fortunately they had better  weather than the presumed dead martial artist laid to rest three days  earlier. Ranma cocked her head, studying the scene for maybe the  tenth time since she had stumbled acrossed it. It wasn't the hero's  farwell she herself had received, but that wasn't what caused her  pause.</i></p><p>"<i>Six, seven, eight…" Ranma counted of  softly as Usagi and the girls began laying single roses on Setsuna  Mieou's empty coffin, one by one. "What's wrong with this  picture…?" The redhead whispered, leaning forward in her sitting  position before the gates. "Y plus thirty two, Z plus three. Give  me a tight angle." The gates obeyed and swung her view up and  around, affording Ranma a close up of everybody present. She counted  the girls off by their planetary names this time and frowned when she  got to the last one. "Now where'd the lil' Spore run off to?"</i></p><p><i>The answer was obvious. She simply wasn't  there. Ranma put a finger to her lips. The question was why wasn't  she there? Puu was one of her best friends, Ranma rationalized, not  realizing she had adopted Chibi's title for Setsuna from memories  that weren't hers. There's no way she'd miss this event. She  didn't know their entire history, but the memories had been flowing  steadily. They were connected somehow and for some reason, the fact  that she wasn't present filled Ranma with foreboding. In fact, she  hadn't been able to find the little pink haired girl anywhere.  Setsuna and Chibi… Something to do with time tra—</i></p><p><i>Ranma bolted to her feet suddenly, panic firing  through her brain. "Scan timeline. Report last major paradox."  The fact that she even knew what a paradox was a trip unto itself,  she realized as the funeral faded from view and was replaced by thick  blackness. Blue lines began to appear in the darkness, some  intersecting while still more branched away. The main blue line  continued until it was interrupted by a pulsing red dot. </i></p><p>"<i>Last major paradox at 15.3380Z.00001 by  132.900567AX0004.00 time-space." The gates reported in a soft  female voice, pausing over the red dot. Ranma Saotome mentally  converted the co ordinance with memories that weren't hers and  swore. Not only was that the day Pluto sent her to this hell hole, it  was the day she died. And if she died, what would have happened to  Chibi Usagi? The redhead actively dug through Setsuna's memories  now, drawing a blank. They were connected somehow and Chibi had  paradoxed out when Setsuna bought it.</i></p><p>"<i>And I was just starting to like the little  trouble-maker…" Ranma frowned unhappily, also unaware that her  memories were mixing with Setsuna's own affections for the girl.  No, she decided. It wasn't going to go down like that. "Open  gates to 15.3380Z.00001 by 132.900567AX0002.00 time space." She was  going to fix this little—</i></p><p>"Operation restricted."<i> The gates'  disembodied voice chided. </i>"Your access is insufficient to  perform the requested operation. Please contact the Time Gate  administrator for further assistance."</p><p><i>Ranma fumed, glaring at the gates themselves.  It wasn't the first time she had heard that message. "The  administrator is DEAD, you piece of junk! Let me OUT!"</i></p><p><i>The gates sat passively by, ignoring her  orders.</i></p><p><i>Ranma began pacing, shooting daggers at the  construct. She had been here for three months and still had yet to  find a way out. While Setsuna's memories had allowed her to use  some of the gate's lower functions, they were still largely  incomplete, and whatever magic she used to get the damn things to  work was still safely hidden behind the curtain that was leaking the  memories into her brain in the first place. If not for the current  situation, she would prefer it to remain that way, as they had begun  to screw with her gender sense in earnest. That night with Lancelot  really stuck out in her mind. It was quite—Ramma scowled, chopping  that particular memory down at the source. It had already led to more  than enough trouble, taking her down roads she swore she'd never  visit in this particular body. Not that it hadn't been entirely  unpleasant. In fact…</i></p><p>"<i>AAHHHHaaaRR!" Ranma clutched her head with  one hand, pounding on it with the other. She stepped away from the  gate and launched into a blistering kata, attempting to clear her  mind. Focus… focus… It was a devilish situation to be trapped in,  she realized. If she wanted out, she had to accept Setsuna's  memories to find whatever would unlock the gates. At the same time,  they brought with them an unbelievable burden. Not only did they  creep in, muddying her own memories, but they were changing her and  she woke up every day, fighting for her own identity. If she just  accepted those memories outright, it was going to get worse sooner  than it got better. Sure, she'd probably find a way out, but at  what cost?</i></p><p><i>But that was the price. Ranma fell out of her  kata, considering the dilemma. If she wanted out, she had to accept  the memories. Not just pieces of them, as the wish hadn't afforded  her that particular luxury. All of them. Not only did she have to  accept all of them, she had to retain her identity in the process,  since the last person she wanted to become was Setsuna Meiou. If it  was just her life, the decision would have been much harder for  Ranma. But it wasn't. Chibi had paradoxed and the redhead felt an  empty, saddening hole where she had existed in her thoughts and  memories. The kid deserved better.</i></p><p><i>Her course decided, Ranma Saotome settled in  for the long haul, none too pleased as to where that road would take  her. Even as she accepted her fate, there was one amusing thought  that became her ever present companion…</i></p><p><i>The life of a martial artist was, without a  doubt, filled with peril.</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i><br/>"So you're completely…" Ukyo asked softly,  unable to finish the question that was too alien to her view of  Ranma.</p><p>"Three thousand years of her versus eighteen of  little old me." The long haired redhead replied in an offhanded  manner, then smiled. "Overall, I'd say I faired pretty well."  She paused and the smile faded slightly. "But there was no avoiding  some of the sacrifices I had to make."</p><p>Ukyo nodded somewhat solemnly, recognizing exactly  what those sacrifices were. Ranma, the man among men was all but  gone. His core remained, but a changed person had emerged from the  Time Gates to save Chibi and himself… <i>Herself</i>, she mentally  revised. No man remained in the person named Ranma Saotome, of that  she was certain. Somewhere in the void, Ranma had crossed too far  over that particular line to return, and she had evidentially made  peace with herself concerning it. It was also something the chef  would have to-</p><p>"Wait a minute…" Ukyo paused abruptly,  interrupting her own thoughts. "You made out with <i>Sir</i>  Lancelot?"</p><p>The redhead didn't even blush. "By proxy."  She stated evenly. If Ukyo didn't know better, she could have sworn  there was even a slight smile in there somewhere. "After all, it  wasn't my body." Ranma didn't feel it necessary to mention the  fact that while it hadn't been her body, she remembered every  exquisite detail of that encounter quite vividly, let alone the fact  that she was probably the Earth's foremost living authority on sex,  even if she was still technically a virgin herself.</p><p>"I didn't realize that Set-chan got around so  much." Haruka muttered to herself, a sentiment that was shared by  most of the Senshi present. The woman had been so mysterious that  none of them knew anything of the time she spent shepherding history  along.</p><p>For her part, Ranma simply shrugged off the  stares. "She had a lot of time on her hands, go figure." This  revelation produced dumb nods from her audience, as it pretty much  said it all. Ami, however, was already doing the math.</p><p>"Three thousand some years time, one guy per  year…" She mentally ticked through the numbers.</p><p>"At a minimum." Ranma added off-handedly,  causing Ukyo to blush. Others simply gaped.</p><p>"And you… remember them all?" The  Okanomiyaki master simply couldn't believe Ranma Saotome, manly man  of men had fallen so far from that ideal, let alone become so…  worldly. It was a sharp contrast from the martial artist she had  known a mere six months ago, one that could barely stand to have a  girl hang on him let alone discuss matters of intimacy so openly.  Ranma simply nodded, keeping her peace on the subject. An  uncomfortable silence settled down on the group, while certain others  marked Ranma as the go-to person on matters of intimacy, should the  matter arise.</p><p>Ukyo shifted away from the uncomfortable topic.  "So does your family know you're alive?"</p><p>Ranma's serene mask slipped noticeably and a  hint of fear crept across it. "No. Wasn't planning on letting  them know either."</p><p>Ukyo Kuonji blinked. Then she blinked again. Usagi  took up the next obvious question; the one Ukyo was dying to ask.  "But… why?"</p><p>"I've had about six months to think on it, and  I agree with Setsuna." Ranma began sullenly. "I've taken over  the mantle of Pluto. Everyone I know will pass away. I don't need  that. They don't need to watch me stay young while they slowly die  off…" With those words, it was the first time any of them  considered their impact on the world around them, beyond the theme of  love and justice. They would all live on even as their family and  friends grew old and died around them. "Since I'm already dead, I  think I'll let sleeping dogs lie, y'know?"</p><p>"Oh no you will not, Ran-chan!" Ranma's head  jerked up from her introspection, finding his best friend's eyes  locked solidly with hers. "A little bit of Nerima died that day  with you. Do you know how many times your mother tried to commit  seppuku?"</p><p>The answer came softly. "Yes."</p><p>"Even the Tendo's suffered after they heard  about your death." Ukyo detailed the events of since her absence.  "And Akane… She's just not the same. Her spark is <i>gone</i>.  I never thought I'd say it, but I miss it."</p><p>"I don't know…"</p><p>"You should." Ranma blinked. The voice came  from the diminutive pink haired girl wrapped around her. She stared  up at the Princess of Pluto with her big red eyes. "Enjoy them  while you can." A tear rolled out of one eye, leaving a glistening  trail down her cheek. One from Ranma herself soon followed. Of all  people, Small Lady would know, she thought, and given Ranma's  unique circumstances, her words carried substantially weight with the  martial arts guardian of time, more so than her ex-fiancee. She  looked from her, then back to Ukyo, who simply nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Chibi smiled brightly and tightened her hug around  the redhead. Ukyo gave her a pat on the shoulder. "It's gonna be  okay, Ran-chan."</p><p>The pair sat comforting Ranma for a few more  moments until she had recovered enough to field Michiru's question,  which was thankfully not along the same vein as the last. She  couldn't have known that her particular topic of conversation was a  keg of high explosives waiting to be lit. Neptune struck the match.</p><p>"So if you're the new Senshi of Time, how is  Crystal Tokyo looking?" She forwarded. "Has the change-over  disrupted those probabilities?"</p><p>"Yes." The reply brought an instant hush over  the other Sailors.</p><p>"How…?" Usagi asked with trepidation. Was  there another big enemy they had to eliminate? "How bad is it?"</p><p>"There's a zero point zero chance of Crystal  Tokyo coming about." Ranma reported. The silence was deadening for  a moment, then chaos reigned.</p><p>"ZERO?" Haruka lurched forward in total  disbelief.</p><p>"How in the world is that possible!" Ami's  eyes were wide in similar disbelief. She pulled out the Mercury  computer and began tapping in variables.</p><p>"If Crystal Tokyo doesn't exist…" Moon let  the statement speak for itself. If that future didn't exist, then  mankind was totally and completely doomed. Not even the small remnant  of man would survive. "It was nearly one-hundred percent before we  took the pocket universe out! What the hell happened!"</p><p>"<i>I happened." </i></p><p>Ranma stood up from her seat and Chibi  disentangled herself from the redhead. Ukyo knew the look of ice that  resided in the Saotome's eyes and mentally readied herself for what  was about to occur. She had no idea what Crystal Tokyo was, but if  Ranma was about to lay some smack down, there would be no question as  to whose side she'd come down, regardless of how many youma she had  slain with the sailors. She stepped off to Ranma's right flank,  giving them both combat room. It caused the redhead to smile  slightly. Even after so much change, it was nice to know some things  never would.</p><p>"You <i>what?</i>" Haruka hissed, deadly venom  leaking from her voice.</p><p>"But Setsuna…!" Makoto practically squeeled  and Ranma cut her off sharply.</p><p>"Maybe I should reintroduce myself." She bit  testily. "I'm <i>Ranma Saotome</i>, heir to the Anything Goes  School of Martial Arts, Guardian of Time and Last Princess of Pluto.  I am <i>not</i> Setsuna Meiou and I <i>will not</i> let over nine  billion people die on my watch."</p><p>"Are you saying you will deny man its last hope  of survival!" Moon bolted upright, totally forgetting the cookies  she had been munching on contently.</p><p>"No." Ranma burned a hard stare into Moon, who  took a step back. "I'm saying that I <i>will not</i> write off  ninety-nine percent of the world's population on some idyllic post  apocalyptic future. The lines may have blurred while I was trapped in  the Time Gates, but one thing that hasn't is that the first duty of  a martial artist is to protect those who cannot protect themselves,  and I <i>will</i> fight to my last breath before that future comes to  pass."</p><p>"And what do you think you can do to stop us  from pursuing it?" Michiru stepped up to Haruka, flanking Usagi.  "In fact, what's to stop us from revoking your status as  <i>substitute</i> Guardian of Time?"</p><p>Ukyo reached around her back, bringing the combat  spatula to bear. She took Ranma's own over-confident grin as her  own. "You're welcome to try, Sugar."</p><p>Usagi's wide eye stare matched those of the  inners, who obviously hadn't been expecting any confrontation, let  alone one that would escalate so far out of control so quickly. That,  and she couldn't figure out why there was a huge grin plastered  across Chibi Usa's face, who had yet to leave the redhead's side.  Moon couldn't believe it—One day as a real Senshi and Ranma was  staging her own mini rebellion! In that moment, all the sacrifices  they had made in the name of Crystal Tokyo came to the forefront and  she did the only thing she could.</p><p>"No!" She snapped. "I did not let billions  die! You can't just come in and destroy everything we've worked  so hard for in two hours time! As the Princess of the Moon, I cannot  allow that!"</p><p>"Two hours?" Ranma scoffed, putting her hand  to her hips defiantly. "I've had six months and <i>three thousand  years</i> of fucking memories to consider this, little girl. As I see  it, you don't have much of a choice."</p><p>Moon glared at the redhead. "Hmmf! I can always  remove you as a Senshi with this!" There was brief flash of light  and the glowing crystalline form of the Ginzuishou formed in her  hand.</p><p>Ranma's rolled her eyes. "<i>Pah-lease</i>. I  have every memory of you that Setsuna has. You can barely even use  that stupid rock, let alone remove my abilities before I can  incapacitate you; and even if you managed to accomplish that feat,  I'm still the best martial artist in the world. You wouldn't last  five seconds."</p><p>Two pink flashes erupted at Moon's side and  Michiru and Haruka processed their transformation to from civilian to  Senshi, taking up attack stances. "I think you're over-estimating  your odds, you redheaded bitch."</p><p>"<i>I don't think so."</i></p><p>Another flash of light perforated the room once  more. Once it faded, the Senshi froze in panic. Even the outers at  Usagi's side took a step back. Ukyo simply stared. What had once  been the little pink haired girl at Ranma's side was now a lithe,  fully developed woman. 'Goth' was the first thing that came to  her mind as her eyes fell upon the woman clad in a pitch black  evening gown, wrapped in translucent of pink and black streamers. It  was all bound by a studded black collar. Her forehead was topped with  a golden moon symbol and Ukyo decided that somehow, the clash of cute  and gothic worked for the girl. That's also when she noticed it  absolutely wasn't working for her former friends.</p><p>Usagi was the first to find her voice. <i>"Black  lady!"</i></p><p>"How the hell did that happen!" Rei screeched  and took several steps back, while Haruka let a silent "oh shit"  form at her mouth. Everybody present remembered their last encounter  with Chibi's Wiseman-born alter ego, as well as the ass-whooping  that followed. Every Sailor in the room activated their  transformations simultaneously and took defensive positions off  Sailor Moon, who was holding the Ginzuishou like it was some warding  symbol.</p><p>The pink haired woman laughed with contempt as she  rejoined Ranma's side as she had in her smaller form, only now it  seemed a far more intimate gesture. If Ranma objected, it wasn't  written on her face or body language.</p><p>"And <i>what</i> do you think you're going to  do with <i>that</i>?" Her voice sounded like tiny daggers who had  found amusement in the girl in front of her.</p><p>"I'm going to use its power to return you to  normal, Wicked Lady!" Moon proclaimed, and began concentrating. The  crystal glowed briefly, flickered and died. She stared at the  crystal, then Usa, then back to the crystal and began to shake it as  if it were a defective piece of electronics.</p><p>Usa sighed, clearly bored with the scene. "The  catalyst for that particular change was removed when my timeline was  wiped." She turned slightly into the Senshi of Pluto next to her.  "I spent nearly 900 years trapped in that silly body …yet another  thing I have to thank Ranma-chan for correcting." Even Ukyo arched  an eyebrow at how close she had moved to Ranma. She didn't seem to  be discouraging the pink haired goth, either.</p><p>Sailor Venus peered at the woman formerly known as  Chibi Usa, noting the gold moon on her forhead. "She doesn't <i>seem  </i>evil…"</p><p>"If I were evil, I would have blasted you all to  glass by now." Usa remarked dryly, taking the others back. "As it  is, I'm simply in agreement with my Ranma-chan. I've been through  the catastrophe once. I was assured it was the only way then, and  now, I will <i>not</i> allow it to happen again."</p><p>The fact that she was refering to Ranma as <i>her</i>  Ranma-chan didn't go unnoticed by Ukyo, who was already doing her  best not to tear the interloper slash ally away from Ranma's  personal space.</p><p>Sailor Uranus stepped forward in Moon's silence,  trying to regain the upper hand in their standoff. "Somehow, I  doubt that you can take all of us <i>and </i>stand up to Saturn's  power as well."</p><p>As if that were her cue, Sailor Saturn stepped up  from the back and past the Senshi, who immediately began to gape.  Uranus cursed to herself as Hotaru's adult form walk past her to  confront Ranma. Luscious, floor-length black hair flowed behind her  fully developed figure and Uranus swore again. When the hell did <i>that  </i>happen? It was just a fucking red letter day all the way around.  Off to her right, Mercury twitched. She had since recognized the  adult form as sort of an armament switch and was not looking forward  to the planet buster going live. A beautifully dressed planet  bluster, clad in a sleevless silk vest, pearls and a long, elegant  dress, but a planet buster none the less with Silence Glaive balanced  lightly on he left shoulder.</p><p>"Hotaru." Ranma managed the air of serene  mystery about her with ease, allowing a slight smile to escape the  cloak. Saturn cocked her head, studying the Guardian of Time  momentarily before turning to Usa, whose dememor was all but  identical. She gave them both a nod and joined their right flank.</p><p>"Saturn, what are you <i>doing!"</i> Sailor  Uranus hissed, unable to believe the trespass that had just occurred.</p><p>The matured Saturn pursed her lips and cast a  sidelong glance over to Usa. "Joining my friends. Besides, I think  I'd prefer the company of those who haven't been plotting my  demise."</p><p>The Outers gut turned to solid ice with those  words.</p><p>Ukyo's mind flew through the startling  developments, trying to make sense of the entire situation with only  a limited amount of history at her disposal. Somehow, Ranma had just  rallied the two most powerful Senshi to her cause. What that cause  was, exactly, she wasn't sure, but it was enough to afford her a  largely patronizing smile for the remaining Senshi, Uranus in  particular. "How are those odds looking now, Sugar?"</p><p>Moon stared incredulously at the force now arrayed  against her, which easily eclipsed hers in both skill and power, if  not numbers. The girl she had considered her little sister for so  long had matured into a stunning woman with nearly nine-hundred years  of experience her senior. She had joined the side of not only the  world's premier martial artist, but the newly anointed Senshi of  Time with three thousand years of memories to call her own. If that  weren't enough, their presence was now augmented by the recently  matured and slightly resentful Sailor Saturn. Words simply could  describe the amount of dread that particular bit of knowledge  invoked. Finally, there was Ukyo, whose own skill, if not power  easily rivaled that of any of the Inners. All in all, it was turning  out to be a bad situation for Moon to be in, even with the  superiority she had in numbers.</p><p>Finally, the inevitable happened. Sailor Moon  broke into tears.</p><p>"But... but why!" She sobbed with huge eyes.  "I'm such a <i>good</i> princess!"</p><p>Usa sighed and Ranma stepped forward with an  unreadable mask etched on her face. The redhead took the girl's  hand and looked into her eyes, and it was as if that serene calm  flowed into the blond, stabilizing her emotional state somewhat.  "Perhapse, but there is more to being a princess- or a queen for  that matter –than waving a crystal around, or a wand or running  around it a fuku."</p><p>"But… Crystal Tokyo…" Moon sniffled and  the Guardian of Time sighed. She just wouldn't let it go.</p><p>"The only reason Crystal Tokyo even seems like a  remotely good idea is because actually saving the world has far  longer odds attached to it." She explained patiently as the rest of  the Sailors listened in, never having heard this particular aspect of  the mission before. "It all comes down to doing the smart thing or  the right thing. The smart thing is to cut your losses and wait for  Crystal Tokyo. The <i>right</i> thing is to fight for every last man  woman and child on this planet, even if you or every single last one  of us go down in the attempt."</p><p>"The path of a Magical Girl is fraught with  peril." Ukyo quipped as she sheathed her combat spatula, earning a  smile from her best friend in the process.</p><p>Ranma nodded at the essence of her comment. "Are  you a guardian of love and justice?" Moon blinked. Of course I am,  she thought as Ranma's stare bore into her. What kind of question—</p><p>"Then your path is clear."</p><p>Sailor Moon blink at the enigmatic statement and  watched as Ranma Saotome, Heir of the Anything Goes School of Martial  Arts, Guardian of Time and Last Princess of Pluto turned on heel and  leave the room followed by Dark Usa, heir Primus to the throne of  Serenity, Sailor Saturn and Ukyo Kuonji, Okanomiyaki master and Demon  hunter extraordinaire.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"So have you thought about where you're going  to stay?"<p>Ukyo asked as the four women stepped out into the  open air of the dusk sky. For the passers by they were quite a sight,  being more than a bit on the exotic side. For once, the chef and her  combat spatula weren't the ones drawing the most attention. Of  course, it didn't help that all four of them were absolutely  gorgeous either. Frankly, Ukyo was having a hard time not staring  herself. Not only was her best friend alive… She was <i>changed.</i>  Granted, coming back from the dead might do that, she acknowledged,  but the amount of change was nothing short of staggering. In fact,  none of the women currently in her company had left that room  unchanged.</p><p>Chibi Usa had transformed into a lithe, pink  gothic fairy, and held herself entirely too close to the now female  Ranma to be construed as anything but intimate. Worse still was the  fact that Ranma had done nothing to dissuade her presence. Ukyo took  another, discreet glance over at the pair. The way Usa had her arm  subtly entwined with Ranma's was nowhere near the glomps of old,  but they were infinitely more suggestive.</p><p>Then there was Hotaru, who still maintained her  quiet, neutral demeanor, but held it with an air of authority now.  She too had undergone a startling transformation. Gone was the  self-conscious school girl in favor of a full developed woman, with  quite possibly the best figure of the four of them. All in all, she  was nothing more than a punctuation mark on an already well written  sentence concerning the stunning beauty they invoked.</p><p>Then there was the <i>hair.</i></p><p>Ukyo simply couldn't believe it. It wasn't  often that her waist length black mane was eclipsed by the women  around her, and now all three of them had done exactly that. There  was just <i>so much</i> of it. Ranma's bright red hair easily  reached her calves, while Usa's pink streamers did likewise. Of  course, none of it held a candle to Hotaru's, whose luscious black  tresses somehow flowed along the ground, getting neither tangled or  dirty.</p><p>The Okanomiyaki Master was getting a tad jealous,  quite frankly.</p><p>Ranma cocked her head thoughtfully. "I think  that was enough drama for one night, so Nerima's out." Her best  friend silently agreed. The Senshi standoff had been dramatic  enough, let alone the chaos Ranma would incite on her return to  Nerima. Ranma looked at Hotaru and Usa, frowning slightly. "And I  did mange to get us all kicked out of our homes." Usa smiled and  gave her arm a light squeeze while Hotaru merely shrugged. "I guess  we'll have to find a hotel for the night."</p><p>Ukyo smiled. "Come on, Ran-chan, you know my  door is always. It'll be a tight fit for all of us, but…"</p><p>"I was thinking of the Imperial." Ranma  commented, causing Ukyo to choke on her words.</p><p>"THE IMPERIAL!" She gasped, staring at her  best friend as if she had not only changed genders and become the  Guardian of Time, but grown a second head as well. "Uh, don't  know how to break it to you, Sugar, but the Imperial rates  thirty-thousand a night… <i>Minimum.</i>"</p><p>"No worries, Ucchan." Ranma smiled gently.  "It's all taken care of."</p><p>"Taken care of…?"</p><p>"How do I put this…" The redhead put her  finger to her lips, only to have Usa preempt her explanation.</p><p>"Setsuna was loaded."</p><p>"And now, so am I." Ranma finished, and the  two women smiled at each other. There was an unspoken something that  passed between them and it was a something that was making Ukyo very  uncomfortable. She turned back to the chef. "Setsuna's been  collecting wealth for nearly three thousand years now, secreting it  in stashes world wide. A few million in a bank here, another couple  in a bank there. Priceless works of art. Precious stones from  Atlantis. I could <i>buy</i> the Imperial if wanted to out of my play  money."</p><p>"You could buy every five star hotel in Tokyo  out of your play money." Usa teased, causing Ranma to smile.</p><p>"True."</p><p>"So not only are you alive, a Senshi and retain  three thousand years of your predecessor's memories," Ukyo ticked  off with her fingers. "You're also filthy, stinkin' rich."</p><p>Ranma's smile widened. "That's about right."</p><p>The Okanomiyai master demon hunter sighed, totally  exasperated. "Even dead, the chaos sticks to you like glue."</p><p>The laughter that comment incited lasted them all  the way to the Imperial, where upon Ranma checked them in under an  account that instantly earned them the staff's undivided attention.  Three deluxe suites on the Imperial's 16th floor ensured  it stayed that way, and the uneven number of rooms didn't register  with Ukyo until they stepped of the elevator. She found her room and  watched Ranma and Usa continue down the hall.</p><p>"Three rooms?" She asked, hesitantly, to which  Ranma nodded with a carefully neutral expression. Usa's proximity  was not lost on the chef. "And where will you be sleeping?"</p><p>"We'll be sleeping… together."</p><p>Ukyo Kuonji's mental process stumbled and plowed  into a brick wall with Usa's words, who hadn't so much as batted  an eye. The pair was entirely too calm and the implication was too  obvious to ignore, especially given the signs she had been seeing all  day long. If Ranma was as rich as she claimed, there was no doubt she  could afford another suite if she so chose… Which meant… No. No  <i>fucking</i> way. There had to be another explanation.</p><p>"Um, Ran-chan?" She began tentatively. "Can  I have a word with you?" Her eyes flicked to the pink haired woman  next to her, frowning. "Alone?"</p><p>Ranma nodded to Usa, who took the keycard from the  redhead's hand and found the room only a few feet away. Ukyo  remained silent until the suite door clicked shut with the woman  safely behind it.</p><p>"Ranma, what the <i>hell</i> is going on!"  Ukyo spat sharply, covering the distance to her friend easily. "Tell  me that is <i>not</i> what I think it is!"</p><p>"It's exactly what you think it is." Ranma  sighed. Ukyo's jaw dropped, her train of thought promptly derailing  in a massive wreck of twisted metal. "I told you there were  sacrifices. With those sacrifices came changes. Lots of them."</p><p>"But… but..!" Ukyo gibbered, desperate to  form a coherent thought. "But she's a girl! You're not a…!"  Her thought process took another stumble as Ukyo realized she didn't  know what the proper sexual orientation for Ranma was anymore. He was  a guy who changed into a girl, who preferred girls. So what happens  when you start preferring the girl's body? Do you still prefer  other girls? How about guys? Did that make Ranma a homosexual or  lesbian? Even if the martial arts demon hunting chef had made it past  that hurtle, she would then have to consider the effects of three  thousand years of female memories being imposed on an eighteen year  old male psyche.</p><p>The martial arts Senshi waited patiently for the  shock to expend itself before continuing. That unnerving aura of  calmness surrounding Ranma only served to reinforce Ukyo's growing  feelings toward the redhead. She didn't know her friend <i>at all  </i>anymore.</p><p>"I've explained the memories and Setsuna's…  pastime." Ranma explained calmly, taking Ukyo's hand. "What I  haven't explained is the relationship between Usa and myself.  Before the memories, I knew her as a cute little trouble making  child. After the memories, that view changed. Radically. I now share  quite a history with her, and probably know her better than anybody  alive. Likewise, she not only shares those experiences, but those of  the future. She has lived what could have been, and apparently both  myself and Setsuna featured prominently in that future."</p><p>"That's just…. Weird." It was also a vast  understatement, but it was the best the shell shocked Ukyo could come  up at the moment.</p><p>Ranma nodded, sharing the sentiment. "Even if I  wanted to, there's no way I could deny the bond. That bond…changed  when Chibi cast her childhood form aside."</p><p>"So…" Ukyo paused, trying to catch a mental  breath. "You're both…" She clutched her head. "Dammit  Ran-chan! If I was gonna get beat out, I expected it to be by another  fiancée with you as a guy, not <i>this!</i>"</p><p>Ranma snorted, as laughter cracked her calm  façade. "You and me both."</p><p>The introspective humor caught Ranma's childhood  friend off guard. "What do you mean…?"</p><p>"I had no idea Setsuna was such a freak… And  now here I am, by proxy." Ranma shook her head. "Men, women,  threesomes…" Ukyo simply blinked. "But then, three thousand  years is more than enough time for boredom to set in, I guess."</p><p>Ukyo continued to blink, and it was a good minute  before anything resembling a coherent thought found its way to her  mouth. It came out in the form of a weary sigh. "Alright, too much  information."</p><p>Another nod understanding nod from Ranma. "Tell  me about it. Anyway, you'll always be Ucchan to me. See you  tomorrow." Ukyo watched as the person that was simultaneously her  best friend and perfect stranger disappeared through the door Usa had  claimed.</p><p>She was certain that wouldn't be the only thing  claimed tonight.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"A limo?" Ukyo arched an eyebrow as the first  rays of dawn cracked the skyline. Truth be told, Ukyo Kuonji hadn't  woken in the best of moods, a state borne of her incessant dwelling  on what was happening in the room next to her last night. It didn't  help matters when they emerged from their room by dawns early light,  positively glowing. The chef barely suppressed the urge to smash a  nearby sculpture into tiny, little pieces.<p>The jet black stretch Bently glided up to the curb  and Ukyo simply stared. "Don't you think that's a bit much?"</p><p>"Nah." Ranma dismissed the missive. "I just  spent six months cooped up in the Time Gates. Figure I'm entitled  to some pampering." Usa disengaged from her arm, turning to Hotaru.</p><p>"How about it, Ru-chan?" The pinked haired  women inquired easily. "Shopping?</p><p>"Don't mind it I do," A smile cracked  Hotaru's neutral mask.</p><p>Ukyo watched a chauffer opened the doors of the  black monolith on wheels and hesitated as the three women got in. The  ground she was transversing with Ranma wasn't just unfamiliar, it  was downright treacherous.</p><p>"Coming, Ucchcan?"</p><p>Ukyo broke from her introspective to find Ranma's  bright blue eyes locked on to hers, having paused in the doorway.  Ukyo hesitate some more. "Look, I don't know… I have the  restaurant to look after, and…"</p><p>"The restaurant will take care of itself for one  day." Ranma stated, then continued with a smile, "And if it  can't, I'll send somebody over who can."</p><p>Ukyo favored Ranma with a skeptical look. "And  just how would you do that?"</p><p>Ranma pulled out a business card and flipped it  between her fingers. "Me and the hotel manager are very good  friends." Ranma deadpanned, then smiled. "Seriously, Ucchan, I've  changed, but I'm still Ranma. We just need time to get adjusted."</p><p>"Alright, alright…" Ukyo surrendered,  stepping to the curb. "But don't think I approve of your little  stunt last night."</p><p>"You would have if you had been—OW!" Ukyo  scowled once more as her fist bounced off Ranma's head.</p><p>"For being the Guardian of Time, you sure as  hell didn't see <i>that one</i> coming…"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ryoga Hibiki, heir to the Anything Goes School of  Martial Arts sidestepped the mid-kick that blazed by him, grabbed the  offending leg and pulled it through on it's own momentum. The  action caused one balding middle aged martial artist to stumble  through the maneuver. Ryoga brought his own fist around, ready to  pound his attacker, when the elder pivoted impossibly on one foot and  onto his hand for balance. The remaining foot that was presumed to be  out of position actually was dead on target, and leveled out into  Ryoga's chest.<p><i>WHaaaM! SPALoooSH!</i></p><p>The bandanna'd martial artist went flying into the  only logical place a Jusenkyo cursed person could land, and fell into  the Tendo koi pond, sending a geyser of water high into the air.  Genma Saotome recovered from is combat stance and folded his arms  with satisfaction.</p><p>"You're getting sloppy, Hibiki!" He  proclaimed as a small black creature emerged from the pond.</p><p>"BWeeeeeEE! Bwe Bwee!" The tiny black piglet  sputtered, obviously none too pleased with its impromptu bath.</p><p>"You're still too damn slow." Genma noted,  almost to himself. "Gonna have to hit the speed training harder."  With that, he shrugged and walked across the yard and back into the  house without a second look at the small swine.</p><p>The piglet continued to protest furiously until a  steady of shower of warm water found his person. "Bwee bwee Bwee is  hell because of you, Genma Saotome!" Ryoga paused, noticing the  perspective shift immediately as the curse reversed. "Thanks." He  replied to his unknown benefactor absently. The martial artist  proceeded to collect his clothing from the koi pond before pausing  once more. Warm water didn't often pour from the sky of its own  violation to conveniently reverse his cursed state, and a curious  Ryoga turned around, finding its source sitting happily on the Tendo  property wall mere feet from him. She wore loose red silk pants, a  white sports bra and matching red jacket. Long red hair waved in the  afternoon summer breeze, framing the bright blue eyes that stared  down at him with mischievous intent.</p><p>There could be no mistake.</p><p>A girl had just seen him completely nude.</p><p>"ACK! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"  Ryoga exclaimed, gathering the crumples of soaked clothing around  notable parts of his anatomy.</p><p>"Don't be sorry. You're certainly better  equipped than most." Her smile widened and Ryoga froze. Now  something was wrong. Something beyond a girl seeing him naked. The  voice. The young man's head pivoted back up to the girl, processing  the details he had already seen for the first time.</p><p>"Ieee…eeehh… Impossible…." He whispered,  his formerly crimson blush draining completely away into a white  mask. It was instantly replaced by a look of outrage. "WHY DO YOU  KEEP HAUNTING ME, SAOTOME?"</p><p>The girl arched an eyebrow and flipped off the  wall gracefully from her sitting position, landing neatly beside the  banndanna'd boy. "Put your clothes on, baka. I'm alive."</p><p>Ryoga blinked. Alive? He took a step back from the  would-be apparition, studying her intently. The last one had said it  was alive too. Over, and over, and OVER again. But this one was  different. It was… feminine? The lost boy rolled the conundrum  around in his head. Ranma never came to him looking feminine. Except  for that one time, but she had fangs and two heads then. Of course,  there was always one sure fire way to be sure…</p><p>"PREPARE TO DIE, SAOTOME!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>BOOOooooMMM!</i><p>The thundering crash sent a shockwave through  Nabiki Tendo's cup of tea, casuing the rebounding ripples to send a  few drops into the air and onto the table, eliciting a frown from her  older sister.</p><p>"Oh my."</p><p>The middle Tendo bit her tongue at the innocuous  comment, snatching the hot tea from the table before another rumble  shook the house. A small plate of spring rolls hopped across its  surface. She snatched a glance at Genma, who seemed all but oblivious  to the commotion as he continued to stuff his face. Ok, she thought.  If Genma is in here, then who the hell is Ryoga expending that kind  of firepower on? Her eyes flicked over to Akane, who was trying to  get a better of the courtyard from her position. Couldn't be  attributed to her mallet of destruction, either. Nabiki sighed and  got to her feet wearily. It was, after all, her obligation to check  it out. She'd just have to make certain that he paid for annoying her  later on today. Literally.</p><p>Nabiki stepped to the arcadia door to the  courtyard and watched the impossible.</p><p>Two blurs danced across the courtyard, engaged in  high intensity martial arts combat. The first figure was obviously  Ryoga, who was putting everything he had into hitting the second  figure, a red head clad in loose red silk trousers and a white sports  bra. Her main of red hair flowed behind her as she launched into a  nearly impossible aerial corkscrew, taking the her over a punch that  promised to level a building if it connected. Nabiki's breath was  caught in her breath as she watched the impossible scene play out. No  way. That couldn't be…</p><p>"Akane…" She called in a low, reverent  voice. It instantly got the girl's attention. "I think I need  you to check me on this one."</p><p>"Check you?" The chopsticks paused at  her mouth. The absolute stillness of her elder sister earned her  undivided attention.</p><p>"Yeah, because I'm not the one prone to  seeing visions of Ranma dancing in my head." Akane blinked, not  comprehending the words for a moment before scrambling up from the  table. Chopsticks clattered the ground and she was instantly at  Nabiki's side, watching the same scene.</p><p>"Im…possible!" The sound of a broken  dish accompanied Akane's words. If she could have turned around, she  would have found Kasumi with an equally shocked look on her face.</p><p>"Oh…Oh My…." She studdered in a most  un-Kasumi like manner. "Ranma's… back from the dead. I'll have  to prepare another setting."</p><p>The two traded blows for a few more minutes before  separating, as if my mutual consent. Ryoga stared at his opponent,  who smiled mysteriously back. It took the banndanna'd martial artist  a minute to gather the courage to say his next words.</p><p>"R…Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma cocked her head with an innocent smile.  "Yes?"</p><p>"You'e alive?" Ryoga stepped forward,  poking the redhead in the shoulder.</p><p>"Last I checked." She stepped up to him  and took his hand. "It's good to see you, Ryoga-kun." The  moment held until Ranma was plowed over by the youngest Tendo sister.</p><p>"Oh my God! Ranma! You're alive! It's  impossible!" Akane and Ranma hit the ground in fierce embrace,  Ranma sputtering laughter.</p><p>"Yes! Yes! I'm alive for cryin' out loud!"  She protested from the ground half heartedly as a small crowd of  close friends gathered around in disbelief. It took another minute  for Ranma to pry Akane off and make it to her feet so that the others  could acknowledge her existence. The next hug was far more gentle in  nature as Kasumi stepped into her.</p><p>"It's very good to see you again, Ranma-kun."  She smiled warmly and Ranma knew Usa and Ukyo had been right after  all. "I was starting to get worried about you."</p><p>Ranma blinked. She wasn't even about to touch that  one so she settled for a simple nod. "Thanks, Kas-chan. It's  good to be home…"</p><p>"What gives, Saotome? You're supposed to be  dead." Nabiki asked, her voice laden with a mixture of  skepticism while fighting to keep the awe from being audible. Of  course, none of them should have been surprised, she amended as an  after thought. The guy had cheated death so many times it was getting  to be old habit.</p><p>The Saotome shrugged. "I got better."</p><p>Nabiki cast him a dry look and took stock of the  martial artist, who was retrieving her red jacket that had been  hanging off a nearby kotoji. It didn't take her powers of observation  to note the changes in the martial artist's appearance, starting at  the leg length hair and ending in the fashionable red ensemble what-  to Nabiki's trained eye -looked to have cost a shiny yen or two.  Beyond that, if Ranma actually was still alive… "Come on,  Ranma, we need to talk."</p><p>"Nabikiiii…" Akane growled stepping  defensively to Ranma's side, who simply watched the scene play out.</p><p>"You know what's going to happen when Genma  finds out, A-chan." The middle sister justified, which did  nothing to dissuade Akane's glare.</p><p>"And you <i>know</i> what happened last time  you tried your petty scheming on Ryoga-kun." Now Ranma moved  from amusement to genuine curiosity as Nabiki's mask faltered ever so  slightly.</p><p>"But…"</p><p>Akane cracked her knuckles, which popped audibly.  Each pop seemed to reinforce her own position on the matter. Nabiki  frowned, but remained quiet this time. Seeing that her message had  been clearly received, she turned back to Ranma with a smile. "Ranma!  You look…" The smile faltered slightly as she took in the  redhead's appearance, but was quickly replaced. "…It's good to  see you again, Ranma."</p><p>"What she means is, 'my you look incredibly  feminine'" Nabiki adlibbed with a dry smile, to which Ranma  shrugged.</p><p>"Being dead will do that to you." She  replied cryptically, then turned back to Ryoga. "Your speed  needs some work, but you've got a solid grasp on the technique."  She paused, as if thinking of something. "Do I even want to ask  why Pops is teaching you Anything Goes?"</p><p>Ryoga simply shook his head and Akane replied for  him. "No. You <i>really</i> don't."</p><p>"Two thousand yen." Nabiki held out her  hand expectantly and Ranma failed to stifle her chuckle.</p><p>"If I wanted to know the future, I'd just go  look for myself, Nabs." She replied nonchalantly, then sniffed  the air. "Is that lunch I smell?"</p><p>"Oh my," Kasumi exclaimed in a slightly  alarmed manner. "You must be starved after coming back to life."  Ranma didn't have the time or inclination to object as Kasumi led her  from the yard and into the house, where a balding old man in white  karate gi sat stuffing his face. His portion of food long since  depleted, the resource harvester had since moved on to Akane and  Nabiki's plates. Kasumi's remained miraculously untouched. The eldest  sister sighed. "Mr. Saotome, if you don't behave yourself, I  might be forced to put you on another diet."</p><p>The blurring chopsticks froze abruptly, hovering  millimeters from the last morsel on Akane's plate. "Uh.. heheh  heheh.." He turned to give the Tendo an innocent smile, only to  have it wither and die off his face as he found the person standing  next to her. "Boy? Is that you?"</p><p>"Jeez, gone six months and nobody  recognize-OOF!." Ranma commented only to have the life  squeezed out of him as Genma seemingly teleported from his sitting  position to a bear hug around the redheaded girl.</p><p>"I knew you couldn't be dead! No stupid puny  youma could defeat my son! Not even a universe full of them!"  Genma beamed, yanking the girl back and forth. "We've got to  tell Nodoka-chan! And Soun! The schools can be-!" Ranma broke  the fierce embrace easily and stepped back, with an expression whose  temperature had dropped sharply. It wasn't outright hostility or  anger, but all the warm familiarity had drained away.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"-joined?" Genma stood bewildered; his  arms suddenly empty of his son. He stared at the girl in front of  him, who had donned a mask as unreadable as any Nabiki had ever  owned. Beside her, Akane, Nabiki, Kasumi and Ryoga watched the  unmistakable change in attitude and swore an entirely different  person had just taken over Ranma's body. They weren't too far from  the truth. "But, Son, you're alive! We can finally fulfill-"</p><p>"What part of 'no' don't you understand?"  Ranma replied calmly. "While it's good to see you too, there  will be no engagements, Genma Saotome. Period."</p><p>Genma was at a loss, torn between the incessant  need to fulfill his family honor and the spontaneous resurrection of  his son. Of course, that wasn't the only thing to give the aging  martial artist pause, as he was noticing the exact same changes the  others already had. With indecision waging war in his psyche, Ranma's  father opted to take the high road…</p><p>…He'd wait for backup.</p><p>"Nevermind that now," He brushed past  the topic. "Where the hell did you run off to? And why the heck  are you dressed in those girly clothes."</p><p>"That's what I want to know."</p><p>"Same here."</p><p>"Ditto."</p><p>Ranma looked from her father to Nabiki, Akane and  Ryoga, who all waited for the explanation with baited breath. Ranma  shook her head. She really wasn't looking forward to explaining  everything another five times, so she cut to the chase in an effort  to avoid the inevitable. "No, it's not locked."</p><p>"Whew." The tension drained from Genma's  frame. If the curse wasn't locked, then the clothing was no doubt  part of some elaborate stunt the boy was regularly engaged in.  "Kasumi, could you bring the boy some hot water?"</p><p>Kasumi turned to happily comply with his request  only to have it instantly countermanded. "No, Kasumi. Hot water  won't be necessary." Now they were staring at the redhead with  interest. Ranma's curse wasn't unlocked, but had just turned down the  offer to revert to his birth form?</p><p>"You didn't…" Nabiki was the first to  put two and two together, and she wasn't happy with the answer it  came up with.</p><p>Ranma shrugged, allowing a slight smile to escape  the serene mask. "Afraid so."</p><p>Akane, however, was still in the dark. "Didn't  what?"</p><p>"Dammit, you can't do this to me!"  Nabiki protested with outrage, successfully confusing the redhead.  "I've seen hell because of you, Saotome!" She stopped her  tirade short, putting a shocked hand over her mouth. "My God,  I'm even starting to sound like him…"</p><p>"Maybe I should have taken you up on that  two-thousand yen…" Ranma pursed her lips trying to make sense  of the middle sister's outburst when the answer suddenly came to  Akane, who could do nothing but produce a malicious grin.</p><p>"It's Nabiki's 'business arrangement',  Ranma." Nabiki scowled at her sister's words, and Ranma  instantly knew it was going to be a great story. "When you, um,  disappeared, our parents were left without an heir…"</p><p>"Oh, you've got to be kidding…"  Ranma's cool mask lapsed for a moment as she too made the connection.</p><p>Akane nodded, all smiles. "So your father  conned P-chan here into being the heir, while your mom dropped a  chunk of money on Nabiki's doorstep to be the fiancée since I…  wasn't up to it after… well, you know…"</p><p>Ranma was barely suppressing a fit of giggles as  he stared at the two red-faced teens. She turned back to her father,  who was desperately avoiding eye contact. "You know, for once I  totally approve of your stupidity."</p><p>Genma's head jerked up suddenly. "But since  you're back-"</p><p>"Since I'm back, <i>nothing</i>, old man."  The frosty mask dropped back into place and she took an aggressive  step forward. "You have <i>no idea</i> what it took me to get  back to this point, and I'll be <i>damned</i> if I'm going to step  back into this pile of shit you've created for yourself <i>again</i>."  Ranma withdrew and turned to Akane, peace flowing back around her  like a cloak. "…No offense, Akane-chan."</p><p>"Um, none taken?" The youngest daughter  was wide eyed and shocked. It hadn't been the first time Ranma had  called his father out on the stupidity concerning the engagement, but  it was the first time she could remember her outright refusing to  play into it since the day they were first introduced.</p><p>"We'll see how long that lasts." Ranma  turned to find Nabiki cradling the end tables' phone receiver in one  hand, her gaze narrowed sharply on the redhead. Something caused her  to smile, and she began to speak into the other end, her eyes never  leaving Ranma. "Yes, it's Nabiki. Mmm-Hmm. It's good to hear  from you too. Well, sit down please because I have some news for you.  Sitting? Good. He's alive. No, I swear I'm not. Yes, he's here now. I  know. I will. See you in a few." Nabiki lowered the receiver  with a light click, and her smile turned positively feral.</p><p>"That was your mother, of course. She's <i>so</i>  glad to hear you're alive." Nabiki explained effortlessly, as if  such a thing occurred everyday. She was, however, slightly  disappointed that the news didn't seem to even dent Ranma's serene  demeanor. "<i>You</i> may be happy with the way things have  turned out, but I'll be damn if I'm going to get the shaft because of  it."</p><p>"Nabiki…." Akane growled, glaring at  her sister fiercely.</p><p>"No, Akane." She waved her off. "You're  here, he's back and I'm done trying to keep track of the idiot lost  boy over there." She opened her mouth for another round of  biting commentary only to feel a gust of wind, suddenly finding the  redhead in her face, Ranma's nose inches from her own. Nobody had  even seen the redhead <i>move,</i> and the intensity flickering in  the woman's blue eyes caused her to shiver.</p><p>"First of all, we <i>are not</i> your puppets  to be played, Nabiki Tendo." Ranma hissed softly, causing the  sister to take an involuntary step back. It wasn't rage. It could  barely be called anger. But one thing that is was, was displeasure.  <i>Intense</i> displeasure. "You screwed yourself by buying into  this mess, not I or Akane. Suck it up. <i>Second</i>," Nabiki  took another step back, drops of sweat bubbling from her forehead.  "Akane and Ryoga are my friends. Make them unhappy and you make  me <i>very</i> unhappy. Finally, the only reason I'm giving you a  pass here is because I don't want to have to explain everything five  hundred times. Play with me, my family or my friends again like that  and you'll find I can make life <i>very </i>difficult for you."  Nabiki was now backed up against the dining room wall and Ranma  leaned into those remaining inches. "I hope I've made myself  <i>absolutely</i> clear."</p><p>The middle Tendo stood stunned, unable to tear her  eyes away from the radiant blue orbs that had locked onto hers. Of  all the incoherent thoughts that demanded her attention, one stood  out amongst them all… She <i>did not </i>know this woman. She may  have been wearing Ranma's body, but this was not the naïve  martial artist she knew six months ago. That, and she wasn't lying…  She wouldn't simply make her life difficult, she'd make it <i>hell</i>.  Manipulating her again would be like poking a scorpion, or some  similarly venomous animal.</p><p>The redhead started to turn away , but stopped  halfway through the motion. "And while you're at it, give  Cologne and the others a call too."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Ranma Saotome stared at the closed Time Gates,  contemplating her fate. She had endured the last six months of  isolation and memories, somehow retaining her sanity, but not without  a price. The line was blurred and after three thousand years worth of  Setsuna, Ranma could no longer call herself a man. Ranma knew every  aspect of life as a woman intimately from emotion to biological  necessity, and after six months all alone on the night, there was no  turning back. If she had been in her male form, she might have  withstood the flood. Or gone insane. As it was, the memories had left  their indelible mark and she had made her peace with them. It was the  compromise and sacrifice she had to make for what she was about to  do.</i><p><i>The redhead, whose hair had since grown out of  its pigtail took a deep breath and hoped to God those memories hadn't  betrayed her.</i></p><p><i>"Initiate override sequence  alpha-alpha-echo-zero break five." She began, speaking toward  the immobile gates. "Authorization, Setsuna Meiou, Princess of  Pluto."</i></p><p><i>"Initial override sequence recocognized."  The gates replied softly. "Awaiting preliminary identification."</i></p><p><i>Ranma let a dead smile cross her face. She knew  what the gates wanted. They wanted a voice print. Maybe some DNA.  More codes. Unfortunately, she couldn't provide anything beyond the  latter. "Negative. Reincarnation protocols."</i></p><p><i>The gates stood silently for a moment, as if  thinking her words over. "Reincarnation Protocals recognized.  Awaiting override sequence." Ranma took a deep breath and dug into  memories that were all but her own. The Reincarnation Protocals were  exactly that—Should Setsuna have died and be reborn, there was no  guarantee that her biology would match that of which the time gates  knew. For just such an occation, a master reset had been programmed  into the gates, one that only Setsuna Meiou with the memories of  Sailor Pluto would be able to access.</i></p><p><i>And now, those memories were Ranma Saotome's.</i></p><p><i>She began stepping lightly to an invisible  beat, gracefully executing a derivative form of Bugakuand dance and  Silver Millennium ballroom that a scant living few would have been  able to recognize, let alone reproduce. Ranma Saotome flowed through  the night with the precision only a martial artist could achieve…  or somebody who had been practicing dance as a hobby for nearly three  millennia. Lucky for Ranma, she was both at the moment, drawing on  Setsuna's memories as if they were own and her conditioning in the  arts to float through the moment. The tempo in her mind's eye  increased and her movements blurred. The martial artists smiled. In  some ways, it was like a kata; supremely relaxing while it  conditioned both mind and body. It was one of the habits she actually  wouldn't mind keeping from the late guardian of time. The mental  tempo slowed and she came to a precise stop before the Time Gates and  waited.</i></p><p>"<i>Sequence Accepted. Loading Reincarnation  protocols." Ranma relaxed as the voice accepted Setsuna's code.  "Caution. Protocol will purge current Time Gate administarator  Setsuna Meiou from this system. Current Time Gate administrator will  not be recognized henceforth. Proceed with protocol?"</i></p><p><i>Ranma Saotome chewed on her lip, sparing  herself a moment of indecisiveness. There really was only one thing  to be done, and that was to give the go ahead. But there was more.  Once she did so, she- Ranma Saotome –would become the new Guardian  of Time. In order to leave this hell hole and save Chibi Usa, she  would have to accept the mantle of Pluto. As a temporary gag it had  okay. Even fun. But as a permanent post to span a few thousand years,  give or take? But then the other side of the issue came forth into  her considerations… As the Guardian of Time, she could make a huge  difference beyond that of a martial artist. Combined with her innate  skill, the power boost was simply enormous. Add on top of that three  thousand years of wisdom, and she couldn't help but to consider the  possibility.</i></p><p><i>Maybe she could even avert the apocalypse.</i></p><p><i>There really was no choice.</i></p><p>"<i>Execute protocol."</i></p><p><i>The Time Gates opened, bathing Ranma in a shaft  of soft white light as they scanned their new keeper, finding the  pure heart crystal within. The gates pulsed with power and began to  transform the girl, causing her to float inside the bath of light,  while her wild red hair drifted in the ethereal breeze. Lines of  particle light began to drift off the martial artist, who was only  aware of the energy coursing through her body. After a few minutes of  alterations, the gates pulsed again and clad the redhead in the black  and white fuku armor she knew all too well. Ranma floated down on  light boots and watched as the time key emerged from the radiant  gates, floating into her hand. Once in her grasp, the light faded,  leaving a darkened doorway.</i></p><p>"<i>Reincarnation protocol complete." The  gates confirmed. "Register new timegate administrator."</i></p><p>"<i>Ranma Saotome."</i></p><p>"<i>Confirmed." It replied. "Resetting all  keys and protocols to Ranma Saotome, Princess of Pluto."</i></p><p><i>Ranma smiled mischievously, staring at the  frilly heart shaped timekey in her grasp. This was the part she had  been looking forward to. It was her little bit of payback to the dead  Senshi, after having endured three thousand years of her lifetime.  The heart-tipped staff was Setsuna's symbol, and now it was hers.  The staff. The gate. Everything. The martial artist turned Senshi  pulled her Staff of Ascension from weapons space with her free hand  and grinned wildly as only Ranma Saotome could. </i></p><p>"<i>Gate… fuse the keys."</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>"So that 's all of it…" Ryoga  commented in a hushed voice, and Ranma nodded. Across from the pair,  Akane held her silence.</p><p>"I almost didn't even come back…"  Ranma explained in low voice. "So much has changed. Almost too  much." She looked over at Akane, whose eyes were boring a hole  into the roof they sat atop. "I was hoping you would understand  more than anybody."</p><p>The youngest Tendo opened her mouth and closed it,  gathering her thoughts. It was another minute before she made the  next attempt. "I just don't know… I lost something at the  funeral, and now here you are… Part of me wants to grab hold of  that missing part of me tight and never let go… The other just  wants to move on." She took a deep breath, collecting herself  before continuing. "To know you don't even want to be a guy  again… Not simply can't but <i>won't</i>… it feels like a  rejection from the one person…"</p><p>Ranma put a soft hand onto Akane's shoulder as  tears threatened to overtake the girl. "Not rejection, Akane,  just the way of things." Then she paused with a smile. "Besides,  you don't know what perverted is until you've met Setsuna Meiou…"</p><p>Akane tried her best to stifle her own smile, but  failed miserably. "You mean all three thousand years her?"</p><p>"Up close and personal." Ranma chuckled.  "Hell, it's probably your fault I'm like this now, with all that  name calling…"</p><p>"MY FAULT?" Akane blustered with mock  indignation. "You were a pervert long before me."</p><p>"Oh, please." Ranma rolled her eyes.  "You were the one who wanted to see me nude in the tub." An  evil grin cross spread across her face. "Of course, I'd be happy  to arrange-"</p><p><i>Smack!</i></p><p><i>Bonk!</i></p><p>"Pervert." Akane and Ryoga managed  simultaneously, leaving Ranma to clutch her head in pain.</p><p>"Hmmf." Ranma sniffed indignantly. "You  violent maniacs still can't take a joke. Besides, it's not as if I'm  not already taken."</p><p>"Not already…?"</p><p>"…Taken?"</p><p>Akane and Ryoga finished their own thoughts, and  stared at Ranma as if she had grown a second, third and forth head.  It was a look Ranma was getting quite used to. Akane shook her head,  rubbing her temples while Ryoga twitched a couple of times. "Do  we even want to know?"</p><p>Ranma considered Akane and her question for a  moment before smiling mischievously. "Probably not. I'll save  that one for later on this after noon."</p><p>"So you can lay waste to your parent's  reality as they know it?" Ryoga commented, to which Ranma  smiled.</p><p>"Sounds like a plan to me." Something  caught Ranma's attention and she peered down the roof and over to the  Tendo gates as they swung open, revealing a middle aged woman with  chestnut hair, cradling a katana. "Speaking of which, Mom's  here…"</p><p>Akane sighed. "Daddy will be back soon too."</p><p>Ryoga shook his head, knowing the inevitable  conclusion to all the trouble that was being stirred up. "Let  the games begin," he muttered as they all hopped off the rooftop  together.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Gack!" Many would have mistaken that  sound for a migratory water fowl or some small, rodent, though they  would have been wrong. It was, in fact, the sound of Ranma Saotome,  Senshi of Pluto and Guardian of Time being crushed yet again by a  well meaning, but potentially lethal welcome back from the dead hug.  This one had been delivered at the hands of Nodoka Saotome, who was  throttling her son with every bit the enthusiasm as her husband, if  not more.<p>The scene was witnessed by Genma and Soun, who  were now whispering quietly in the corner. Ranma noted them casting  conspiratorial looks her way and mentally smiled, even as her  skeletal structure was brutally crushed yet again. It was so  pathetically obvious, that she couldn't help <i>but</i> to smile.</p><p>"Oh, my manly son is alive!" Nodoka  gushed. "Where have you been! We were so worried about you! Are  you hurt? OOhhh, it's so good to see you!"</p><p>Ranma smiled warmly, finally able to extract  herself from her mother's embrace. "I'm fine, Mom, just fine."</p><p>"So it would appear, Son in law." The  gravelly female voice didn't even surprise Ranma, and she turned  around to find Cologne in the hallway, Shampoo and Mousse in tow.  Shampoo was dressed in her finest lavender silks and practically  jumping out of her skin while Mousse was all white robe and coke  bottle glasses. With Ranma returned from the dead, his grumpy  expression was, well, understandable.</p><p>"Shampoo too-too happy to see Ranma!"  The purple haired girl bounded forward, illiciting yet and other  "gack!" from the redhead, who had only just recovered from  the last. "Shampoo finally be rid of stupid lost boy  engagement!"</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened, and she homed in on Ryoga,  who was now glowering in the corner and Akane was once again  snickering. "Engagement, Ryoga?"</p><p>"Uh… Um…" The Lost Boy floundered.</p><p>"Kiss of Marrige?" Ranma smiled as well,  and he visibly deflated.</p><p>"Yah."</p><p>"BWAHAHAHHahahahhAHAHAh!" The redhead  doubled over in a fit of uncontrollable laughter. Usa and Ukyo had  been right… She wouldn't have missed this for the world.</p><p>"Oh, that isn't the best part," Akane  pointed out from the side lines, snickering. "Somehow- and I'm  <i>still</i> not sure how -he managed to inherit nearly every one of  your old fiancées. Nuka. Makato. Heck, even Arisa is chasing  him these days."</p><p>"Damn you, Saotome…" Ryoga grumbled,  grinding his fangs down. "I've-"</p><p>"-seen hell because of you, yeah yeah."  Ranma rolled her eyes and shook her head. "I'll make it up to  you by taking you to lunch at the Poisson Rokusaburo."</p><p>"The Poisson…?" Nabiki breathed from  her post on the stairwell. "That's about out of your price range  Saotome." Of course it was. Had to be. The Poisson Rokusaburo  was only the home to one of the most expensive five star restaurants  in Tokyo. Rokusaburo Michiba was only one of the best chef in Japan.  Only.</p><p>"I don't want lunch!" Ryoga bolted  upright, lerching forward. "I want you to take your damn  fiancées back!"</p><p>"And I already told you, I'm already taken."  Ranma replied in a matter of fact tone, waving Ryoga's desperate plea  aside. All eyes came to bear on the redhead with that statement, and  Nodoka Saotome positively glowed.</p><p>"I knew my honorable son wouldn't neglect his  manly duties to Akane." She smiled with absolute pride, and the  Tendo in question watched the neutral mask fall once again over  Ranma's features. While this wasn't going to be pretty, it was going  to be memorable, of that Akane was certain.</p><p>Soun and Genma high-fived one another and cheered  for the joining of the schools while Shampoo protest vehemently from  Ranma's arm. Cologne's piercing stare provided back up and the cloak  of distant mysticism only thicken around Ranma in response. Akane  watched as whatever was left of her former fiancée melt away  while the group continued to celebrate and argue, and it was only  then were the full effects of Ranma's changes revealed to her. The  difference was literally night and day.</p><p>"The schools may be joined, but not through  me." Ranma's quiet voice cut through the din, halting all  conversation instantly.</p><p>"Aiyaaah! Ranma choose Shampoo!" The  Amazon squealed, reestablishing her glomp on the redhead. Her grip  closed in and garnered nothing but empty air. Shampoo blinked,  finding Ranma repositioned in an empty corner of the room, peaceful  amusement trickling from her aura. "Amazon glomp never miss. How  Ranma do that?"</p><p>"Never mind that!" Genma blustered and  step toward the redhead. "The only person you're taken by-"</p><p>"-Is me." Ranma smiled. It was an  absolutely wicked smile. Akane was sure Ranma had left the body that  now stood patiently in the corner. She followed her gaze to the  hallway where Kasumi stood with the room's newest guest. She was  tall, had long streamers of pink hair and wore a long black evening  dress. If not for her slight figure and facial features, she would  have easily called her Kodachi's sister, given the attire. Then  another thought pierced her observations… Ranma… and her! The...  the… PERVERT!</p><p>The woman strode confidently through the crowd of  family and friends to Ranma's side, where the two flowed into a  suggestive embrace that prompted Kasumi to whisper a low "Oh  my."</p><p>"Son, I am waiting for an explanation."  Nodoka's tone chilled to sub zero temperatures, and she begand to  thumb the hilt of the family blade like a nervous twitch… or a  rattle snake.</p><p>"The explanation is simple, and I'm only  going to explain it once." Ranma strode forward, glaring at each  of the offending parties. "My manhood died six months ago. Born  in its place is me."</p><p>"Your honor-!" Soun reached for the  biggest emotional lever he could grasp, even as Genma attempted to do  the same.</p><p>"-No, <i>your</i> honor!" Ranma spun  around hissing at the Tendo Patriarch. "Which one of my father's  engagements am I honor bound to fulfill, hmmmm? Shall I fulfill his  pledge to you and stain my own honor by breaking the others?"  Soun opened his mouth to speak, only to have his words cut down once  more. "No. My honor is my own now and your family promises died  six months ago with me." Usa found a seat and sat back, watching  the confrontation with a bemused expression on her face. Even as she  did, her hand remained in contact with Ranma's at all times. The  gesture was obvious.</p><p>"There's still hope, old friend," he  glanced at Soun, who nodded. "The curse isn't locked yet…  NOW!"</p><p><i>Splash! </i></p><p><i>SpAloosh!</i></p><p><i>SPliioosh!</i></p><p>Three kettles of hot water hit Ranma  simultaneously, causing Genma, Nabiki and Cologne to look at one  another and shrug. Akane stood aghast as Ranma took his male form  and stood deathly still in it. Whatever emotion wasn't showing on the  long, black haired martial artist's face, played across his pink  haired partner's easily. She wasn't happy. At all.</p><p>After a minute of stillness, Ranma took a deep  breath yet maintained eye contact with the ground. "Kasumi…?"  The eldest Tendo nodded and disappeared quickly into the kitchen.  Ranma took another breath. "I am <i>not</i> pleased." The  crack of static electricity accompanied his words, and the occupants  of the house looked on in horror as Usa rose to her full height,  black lightening crackling in her hands. "I am not comfortable  in this body anymore and the next person who does that again will  more than likely take a black lightning bolt where the sun doesn't  shine."</p><p>Nodoka pulled herself together from the shock,  retutning to her domineering matricarch persona. "That's not a  very manly thing to say. Now you'll stay a boy until-"</p><p>Kasumi returned and handed the glass to Ranma  without question, and he nodded his thanks before promptly upturning  it over his head. The boy vanished, replaced by the curvy readhead  who was now re adjusting her sports bra. She cast a questioning look  at her mother, cocking her head. "You were saying?"  Nodoka's frown turned downright chilling. "Three thousand years  of memories and several millennia of sexual conquest as a woman will  do that to you, Mom."</p><p>Nodoka Saotome's mouth opened, but nothing came  out. She tried again. "Three thousand…?"</p><p>"Yeah. I keep telling you, it's all changed."  Ranma explained softly as his mother's expression cracked. "I  have an obligation now and the world isn't going to save itself. This  is what I've been given to finish the task I started six months ago."</p><p>"But I thought… You already saved…"  Her mother stuttered through the explanation, trying to make sense of  her son's words, who merely shook her head.</p><p>"No. That was just the tip of the iceberg."  Ranma frowned. "There's a big storm coming, Mom and I- we,"  She pulled Usa close to her, who had sense settled down. "Either  stand against the apocalypse or nearly everybody dies. I can't allow  that, even if it means not being your manly-"</p><p>"MY SON IS SO MANLY!"</p><p>"Gack!" The redhead instantly found  herself in the tight embrace of her mother once more as she attempted  to squeeze the life out of Ranma. "Even as a woman my son is  going to save the world again!" She withdrew and considered the  prospect in more detail. "And with three thousand years of  intimate experience, that makes my daughter a woman among women too!"</p><p>Ranma blinked and Usa leaned into Ranma's ear.  "That's exactly what I was thinking last night…"</p><p>"I don't care if the world is going to fall  apart!" Genma stepped forward, another teapot in hand. 'You can  do it as our son and join the schools at the same time!" With  that proclamation, the kettle was airborn.</p><p>It never reached its target.</p><p>"Dead Scream."</p><p>The room flashed pink and a magical pink burst of  power consumed the kettle, flying up at a forty five degree angle  where it disappeared into the blue sky. The attendees stared at the  perfect circular hole carved through the ceiling as the tiny pink dot  faded from sight. Their eyes then fell, finding Ranma in a white on  black fuku wielding the modified staff of ascension.</p><p><i>BZZZZZzzzzAAAP!</i></p><p>"YowwwWW!"</p><p>Everybody turned to Usa who was once again  crackling with black lightining… and now so was Genma Saotome, who  lay on the ground in a smoldering heap, twitching. Ranma smiled  mischievously at Usa, who curtsied for Ranma in turn. The redhead  then turned her attention to Cologne.</p><p>"I trust I've made myself perfectly clear?"  She leaned forward with menace and Cologne simply smiled. The elder  could only suspect which Senshi Ranma had become, but suspecting was  enough. There was no way she was about to tangle with the persona  that had broken her tribe over a millennia ago.</p><p>"Are you sure I can't convince you to take  Mousse?" The Amazon boy sputtered and backed against the far  wall. "Since it would seem your gender preference is quite  clear."</p><p>"She'll have her hands full with me."  Usa replied for Ranma, snuggling closer to the Senshi of Pluto.</p><p>"I… see…" Cologne blinked. Such  relations within the Amazon were not unfamiliar, but coming from the  young Saotome was…</p><p>"I must say, as manly as you are, this  particular development is quite disturbing." Nodoka commented,  fingering her lip.</p><p>"Tell me about it," Akane agreed,  staring at the pair in disbelief. It was a sentiment mirrored by the  remaining family members.</p><p>Half an hour found Usa and Ranma on the Tendo  rooftop, staring at the bright orange sunset. All in all, it had gone  much better for Ranma Saotome, Guardian of Time and the Last Princess  of Pluto… After all, any event that ended with her father getting  zapped three more times by angry black lightning was a success in her  book. She would be sure to visit them all every now and then, but for  now, destiny called her, and demanded her undivided attention.</p><p>Usa stood up and into the rays of orange-red  light, pulling Ranma up with her entwined hand. "Shall we save  the world, my love?" Ranma smiled, totally at peace with her  decision. This was why she had sacrificed so much and she had long  since known there was no turning back. She nodded.</p><p>"This time, we <i>will</i>." She gave  Usa's hand a squeeze. "After all, we can't leave the world in  the hands of fuck-ups like NERV again."</p><p><i><b>End.</b></i></p><p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Omake by Yarrow-</b></p><p>"But Crystal Tokyo looked like such a  beautiful place," mourned Usagi, "are you sure there's no  way to bring it about without people dying?"</p><p>Ranma thought for a moment, then smiled at the  sad girl. "Don't worry. I'll see to it that there is a Crystal  Tokyo in the future, and no one will have to die."</p><p><i>- 100  years later-</i></p><p>Usagi stared at the towering crystal  structures before her and listened to the gleeful laughter of  children. It was so beautiful, and everyone was so happy.</p><p>"So, what do you think?" asked  Ranma.</p><p>"It's not what I was expecting at all,"  gasped Usagi, "but it looks like an incredible place!"</p><p>"It is. Would you like to go in?"</p><p>"Can we?" asked an excited Usagi.</p><p>Ranma nodded and placed a scintillating  crystal disk on a cord around the other woman's "You can go in  now."</p><p>That was all Usagi needed, and grabbing Ranma  by the hand, cheered and ran through the turnstile to join the crowds  of excited people filling the crystal streets. "I want to go on  all the rides! And get Crystal Candy! And get my picture taken with  ... Queen Serenity!"</p><p>Ranma smirked and said, "Hey, it's part  of the 'magic'. Now, stop standing there with your mouth open; if you  want to do all that today, you'll have to hurry. Crystal Tokyo closes  at midnight, you know."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's Notes;</b><p>This epilogue is an alternate timeline. Why?
