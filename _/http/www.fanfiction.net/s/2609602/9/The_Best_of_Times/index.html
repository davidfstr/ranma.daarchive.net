</div><p><b>The Best of Times…</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i><br/>A Fukufics (dotcom)  Production</p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hold on to your asses. We're going out with a bang.<hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p><b>Epilogue X1</b></p><p><b>U</b>sagi Tsukino set her  book bag on the sofa and closed the apartment door with a soft click.  All in all, it had been a good day, if only because things were  finally returning to normal… Well, as normal as they could be with  Ranma and Setsuna missing in action. It had taken nearly six months  to achieve this measure of normalcy, but it was finally asserting  itself with some measure of predictability. Perhaps the most  difficult part of the ordeal was dealing with those close to Yumei,  no, <i>Ranma, </i>she mentally corrected herself for nearly the  thousandth time.</p><p>The blonde sighed as  she kicked off her shoes and plopped onto the sofa next to the book  bag. She recalled informing his parents that their son had fallen in  the defense of their world, only to be met with staunch disbelief.  Ranma Saotome was, after all, bullet proof and it somehow didn't  come as a surprise to find out the martial artist had taken out a  super powered immortal being. That disbelief lasted only as long as  it took the Elder Amazonian matriarch, her great grand daughter and  Ranma's greatest rival to confirm her story. Distraught wasn't  the word for Nodoka Saotome, who was overcome with crushing despair.  It had taken everything for her husband and their extended family,  the Tendos to keep her from taking her own life over the next week,  but through it she found an odd sort of peace. The life of a martial  artist was fraught with peril, after all. If her son was to fall, she  couldn't ask for anything more manly than for him to save the Earth  with a harem of magical girls in tow.</p><p>Ukyo Kuonji hadn't  faired much better, though she was probably the most stable of all  Ranma's perspective fiancées, in Usagi's humble opinion.  She pulled through and became fast friends with their alter egos in  the process. Shampoo, who had fought at their side, endured as a true  Amazon warrior would have. The man she had chased for so long had  fallen in battle and there could be no greater honor bestowed upon  him… Her only wish was that Ranma would have been hers beforehand.  For Kodachi and her brother Tatewake, Ranma of course had managed to  spirit away the pigtailed girl- or vise versa –and were anxiously  awaiting their return.</p><p>Akane, the "primary  fiancée" as Moon like to think of her, closed up tight  with the news. Usagi had had caught wind of the sister's legendary  temper, but that smoldering inferno seemed to be snuffed out with the  news that Ranma wasn't coming back. In fact, the only thing that  slipped past that neutral barrier of hers was when the Kuno's had  invited themselves to Ranma's funeral, and beat both brother and  sister within inches of their lives.</p><p>The funeral had  surprised the Sailor Senshi most of all. They had all seen them  before. Small get-togethers. A wake. Crying loved ones. What they  witnessed in Nerima was nothing short of hero's farewell.  Emissaries from the Joketsuzoku, the Musk, and the Phoenix stood in  line to honor the fallen along side the host of Furinkan and half of  the Nerimian prefect itself. Friends. Enemies. Family. All bound  together by this one man. It was a stark contrast to Setsuna's  ceremony only days later; whose only attendees were those of the  Senshi themselves. Nobody else knew the Princess of Pluto and  whatever family she had were lost to the annals of time. In some  ways, it was a more somber occasion by several magnitudes.</p><p>So the angst continued  for a few more months. The Kunos would pay them courtesy visits  looking for Ranma. The Tatewake boy would practice his pickup lines  on any Senshi he could find, while his insane sister concentrated  exclusively on Mamoru, much to Usagi's personal consternation. Then  came the obligatory beat-down. Ukyo would also come over on occasion,  release her frustration on the few remaining youma in the area and  cook the Senshi something to eat. After that, she would proceed to  eliminate any sobriety with extreme prejudice over sake and stories  of her best friend. As for the rest, they kept mainly to themselves  in Nerima. The last thing the family needed was a reminder of how  their son had died, Moon figured.</p><p>But it was finally  beginning to turn around.</p><p>The memories were  becoming fonder and the angst lightening. Life was returning to  normal and she could almost snack again without some form of  leadership guilt shadowing her. In fact… The blonde broke from her  introspective on recent events and hopped off the couch, aiming for  the apartment kitchen. Cookies sounded damn good at the moment. If  she was lucky, there'd still be some left from last night's  meeting. The click of the front door coincided with the click of the  refrigerator door and Usagi's hand paused centimeters from the  carton of milk that was her essential snacking component with the  cookies. She tasted the power signature at the door and shrugged,  resuming her quest for the snack. Since the incident, she had made it  a point to sharpen every skill at her disposal- another component of  the leadership guilt –but she was now far more aware of the world  around her as a result. In this case, it was Chibi at the door and  she smiled. Of all the people in their close knit group, Small Lady  seemed virtually immune to the wave of depression that accompanied  the funerals. Usagi snorted mentally. She'd be immune too it she  knew the future as if it had already been written. All in all, the  pink haired Senshi had been vital in keeping the team from dipping  even further into the depressive air with her assurance that  'everything would be ok'.</p><p>Easy for her to say.</p><p>Moon snagged her  cookies from the counter jar and set a course back for the living  room, where Chibi was already talking to somebody. See? Everything  was returning to normal. She wasn't a total failure as a leader,  the Sailors weren't write-offs and they were even allowed to have  friends once in a while. She smiled as Small Lady took notice of her,  then nodded at the dark haired boy she was talking to. Yep.  Everything was getting back to normal. Chibi even had a boyfriend.  Moon almost stumbled as her brain caught up to her mental rambling.</p><p>Chibi has… <i>a  boyfriend?</i></p><p>She tightened her grip  on the glass of milk that threatened to spill out of her hands and  stared. Well this was a first. Usagi stared into Chibi's surprised  expression, one that all but screamed she had been caught red-handed.</p><p>"Uhh…heheh…  You're home!" Chibi proclaimed the obvious, even if it were an  obviously unexpected occurrence. A wide eyed stare greeted the  statement. It slowly faded into a sly smile.</p><p>"Ducked out early."  The blonde replied. Since the incident, she had developed a perverse  sense of humor, and Moon relished the feeling as the pink haired girl  squirmed under her gaze, her face turning almost as pink as her hair.  "You didn't tell us you had a boyfriend, Chibi…"</p><p>"Um… uh…  heheheh…."</p><p>Usagi turned her  attention to the boy, sizing up the thirteen year old that was  purposively courting the future queen of Crystal Tokyo. He met her  gaze confidently and she silently notched a single point of approval.  Still there was something damn familiar about him. Black hair tied  into a pony tail. The iridescent purple eyes were slightly on the  exotic side to be sure. "And who might you be?"</p><p>He took a sidelong  glance over to Chibi, who seemed to have recovered enough composure  to answer his silent inquiry with a shrug. He turned back to Usagi  and flashed an arrogant smile, one she had been known to use herself  as of late. His next words crushed reality as she knew it.</p><p>"I'm Akira Saotome.  Sorry 'bout this."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Can't say I didn't  warn you." The pink haired girl quipped to the boy at her side, who  simply rolled his eyes. The two now sat in the middle of what could  accurately be termed an uproar, as the remaining Senshi returned home  to find Chibi Usa and the boy named Akira Saotome in their midst.  Chibi couldn't help but to note how Usagi enjoyed doling out the  information, savoring their surprise in the same way it had stricken  her only an hour ago. The leader of the Sailors had had time to  recover. The remaining Senshi had not.<p>"Woulda found out  anyway." He shrugged nonchalantly. "If big bro and sis didn't  give us away, Mom and Pop woulda."</p><p>Usa nodded. "True."  She was about to continue their conversation when the pair both noted  the sudden silence. They turned to find all eyes riveted on their  persons.</p><p>"Big brother and  sister?" Makato mouthed.</p><p>"Mom and Pop?" Rei  mimed in disbelief. The story just kept getting better and better.</p><p>"You've got to be  fucking kidding me…" Ami curse as she had been wont to do since  the battle, but unlike the other Sailors, her razor sharp intellect  was already jumping to the obvious conclusions the boy's name  present them. Akira Saotome. Oh sure, there was the possibility that  he was some relative, but she wasn't too fond of coincidence and  the odds that another Saotome would just pop into their lives were  damn long. Combine that with her close proximity to Chibi and her  continually stated assurance that everything would be "okay", and  she was being presented with a nearly impossible conclusion. But not  totally, so she rode it home. With the last name of Saotome, his  father's identity was obvious, but the mother… "So who is your  mom, Akira?"</p><p>The boy cocked his head  and the surrounding girls listened intently. "Pop."</p><p>Haruka affected a  perturbed expression. "She asked who your <i>mom</i> was, kid."</p><p>Akira frowned, and  beside him, Chibi fought to suppress a fit of maniacal laughter. The  answer wasn't lost on Usagi or Ami, however, and their eyes  widened. It wasn't exactly the answer either were expecting, after  all. The cobalt blue haired Senshi rubbed her temples. "I don't  even <i>want</i> to know how <i>that</i> happened…" she grumbled,  and Moon took over the inquiry.</p><p>"What she's asking  is... Well…" She approached the subject tentatively, painfully  aware of how awkward the question was. "Um, your father was…  Ranma?" The name brought silence to the group and Akira responded  with a single nod. "And your mother would be…?" The boy smiled  and laughter continued to burble from the pink haired girl next to  him.</p><p>"Setsuna Meiou, of  course."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Two figures stepped out  of a glimmering sliver of unreality, distorting the air around it in  a wavering glow. The first was clad in black Chinese silks whose  primary feature was a gold embroidered dragon coiling up his body,  while a long pigtail bound his black crop of hair. His blue eyes  scanned the back ally they had stepped into as the woman joined his  side, her luscious green mane of hair floating with the light breeze  created by the temporal gate at their backs. The staff in her hand  bore an uncanny resemblance to a large key, and she drew a sign into  the air with it. While her motions left no trace, the gate at her  back instantly began to loose cohesion, collapsing in upon itself as  if it had never existed. The green-haired woman gave the staff a  twirl and banished it from sight, and with it, the black and white  fuku she had been wearing. Moments later the pair stepped out onto  the sidewalk, the young man still in his black silks while the woman  now sported a lavender skirt and jacket.<p>Blue eyes flicked back  and forth, scrutinizing the environment and people around him. "Well,  it <i>looks</i> like Nerima…"</p><p>"This time it <i>is</i>."  She assured him with a nod.</p><p>Instead of the smile  she had been expecting with the assurance, a mask of steady  neutrality remained on her partner's face. He gave a sniff, as if  testing the air. "It's good to be home and all, but part of me  ain't lookin' forward to this."</p><p>The woman rested a  light hand on his shoulder in sympathy. "It'll turn out just  fine."</p><p>Her words earned a wry  smile from the young man's face. "Oh, and I'm supposed to just  take your word for it?"</p><p>The young woman  blinked, as if shocked. "Not just <i>my</i> word for it."</p><p>"Hers too." He  added, folding his arms across his chest and affecting a look of  annoyance. "One of these days me and her are gonna have a little  talk."</p><p>"Now, hun," She  chided. "Don't make me explain temporal causality to you <i>again</i>."</p><p>The pigtailed martial  artist winced.</p><p>"After all, what fun  would it be if I let myself know everything that was going to happen  in advance?" The young man already knew the answer to that  particular question. Things would get pretty damn boring pretty damn  fast. Then you'd start to second guess yourself. Temporal causality  sucked in his opinion. "That way?" She asked, motioning down the  sidewalk.</p><p>He nodded and continued  the conversation as they began walking. "Not that I don't wanna  see 'em all again, but it's been what… Twenty years? I mean,  we're dead to them."</p><p>"Subjectively," She  corrected. "Only six months have passed here, remember? It was the  closest I could get us. Besides, what are you complaining about? You  got the better funeral."</p><p>The black clad young  man smiled at her artificial scowl. "Feh. Half those people hated  my guts anyway."</p><p>The scowl disappeared  in favor of a mischievous grin and Sestuna smiled. "True. Little  Saffron was <i>so</i> pissed you went and died on him with the staves  in your possession."</p><p>"Serves him right."  The pig-tailed boy's grin widened, then faltered. "Wonder how  Mom's gonna be with all this… And I ain't lookin' forward to  reigniting the fiancée wars."</p><p>The green haired woman  elbowed him as they rounded a corner. "You worry too much. Besides,  I have a surprise for you."</p><p>The man at her side  noted the glint in her eyes and considered her warily. "It ain't  like the last one, is it?"</p><p>"Nope." She piped.  "This one is much better."</p><p>The young man sighed.  "I'm so screwed."</p><p>"If you're lucky."  She whispered seductively. "But for now, let's go tie up some  loose ends."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"You sure this is the  place?" A short pigtailed girl asked, looking up to the boy at her  side. She brushed a green strand of hair from her eyes and gave the  structure another once-over.<p>The red-headed teen  nodded sharply. "Definitely the place. After all, how many schools  of indiscriminant grappling can their possibly be in this town?"  The girl cast a dry look up at him and he shrugged. "Okay, right.  But Pop's directions were pretty specific."</p><p>She sighed, conceding  the point. "No denying that it's the highest concentration of  power this side of Tokyo either, I guess." She paused cocking her  head. "Think we should wait for Mom and Pop?"</p><p>"Nah." He replied.  "Besides, I'm hungry. Aunt Kasumi will fix us something."</p><p>"As long as she isn't  a vampire, like last time." The pigtailed girl quipped, causing the  boy to visibly pale.</p><p>"Ok, point taken."  He admitted. "So we go in, make sure Auntie isn't a vampire and  have a snack."</p><p>"And Aunt Nabiki?"  She arched an eyebrow and the young man sighed.</p><p>"You just <i>had</i>  to bring that up, didn't you?"</p><p>"Well <i>excuse me</i>  if I don't feel like being gutted by a two foot long blade made of  bone." The girl snorted.</p><p>"Come on, we were  eight then." He rolled his eyes. "Besides, Mom assured us that  this is the right time frame this time." She opened her mouth once  more and the young man preempted her this time. "And don't <i>even</i>  get started on Aunt 'Kane, got it?"</p><p>"Can't say I didn't  warn you." The green haired girl replied innocently.</p><p>The red headed boy  mumbled something under his breath and responded by walking up to the  properties front gate giving the bell a shake. They only waited a  moment before the gate creaked open, revealing the smiling visage of  Kasumi Tendo clad in a conservative pink dress and apron.</p><p>"Welcome to the Tendo  do—" She stopped mid sentence and peered over the young man's  shoulder. "Oh my."</p><p>The boy turned around  to find his sister covering her face with one arm and the other  thrust out towards Kasumi, holy cross in hand. He let go a labored  sigh and turned back to the eldest Tendo sister. "You aren't by  any chance a vampire, are you?"</p><p>Kasumi considered the  question a moment, as if she actually had to think about it.  "Goodness, no."</p><p>The girl peeked out  from behind her arm, the cross faltering. He turned back to Kasumi.  "And Nabiki wouldn't happen to own a two foot short sword made of  bone that steals the life energy of its victims?"</p><p>Kasumi's eyes  widened, but she shook her head to the negative. The green-haired pig  tailed girl almost dropped her guard completely. "How about Akane?  Does she wield a ki born mallet of death and destruction?"</p><p>Kasumi blinked and put  a finger to her chin. "Now that you mention it, yes she does." A  kind smile formed on her face once again. "But she doesn't use it  much these days."</p><p>The pair stared at  Kasumi Tendo, then gave each other a shared look. "What do you  think, Sis?"</p><p>The girl pursed her  lips and shrugged. "Two out of three ain't bad, I guess."</p><p>Kasumi considered the  strange pair. They looked eerily familiar. About seventeen or  eighteen if she were any judge and the way the girl wore her hair…  the boy's spiky styling wasn't recognizable, but the red hair was  triggering all sorts of memories in the eldest Tendo's brain… She  broke from the train of thought as the two finished there  deliberation. Whatever was about to happening, it was probably best  to continue it inside.</p><p>Something was telling  her that dinner might be a little late tonight.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki stepped down  stairs, stomach grumbling. This in itself was not odd. It had been a  long day of money collections and extorting, and that was always  bound to work up an appetite. No, what was unusual was the fact that  she wasn't smelling dinner. In some ways that was good, as it meant  her little sister had yet to step foot in the kitchen. She was  getting better, but anything more complex than boiling eggs or rice  was bound to taste like a flavored cinder block.<p>A <i>badly</i> flavored  cinder block, that is.</p><p>On the other hand, it  also meant Kasumi wasn't cooking yet, which meant that some anomaly  had manifested itself in the eldest sister's household regiment.  These days it probably was something mundane, like running out of soy  sauce or the like. Still, making money worked up an appetite, and if  dinner wasn't forthcoming, she'd have to take matters into her  own hands.</p><p>She stopped short of  the living room, finding Kasumi leading two guests into the house.  Her dinner was being delayed for… Strangers. Nabiki hid the scowl  with a mastery born from years of experience. Maybe she could help  expedite their departure… or find some form of monetary  compensation through their presence. She stepped fully into the  living room, and the pair caught sight of her.</p><p>What the <i>hell!</i></p><p>The same details that  had given her older sister pause flashed through brain, and Nabiki's  knife-like thought process broke them down and dissected them at  lightning speeds few others would have been capable of. There was no  mistaking the family resemblance and she knew for a fact that the  Saotome's weren't expecting other children, let alone ones that  were her age. Extended family? Not likely, she decided. The green  hair on the girl was a bit out of the ordinary, but the boy's red  hair screamed 'Ranko'. They even carried themselves like the  former fiancée to be. The boy even had his eyes, dammit!</p><p>"Heyas, Auntie Nabs."  The boy waved nonchalantly, while the girl seemed to be studying her  warily.</p><p>Nabiki tore her eyes  from the two newcomers to Kasumi paled face. The eyes told her  everything she needed to know. "Umm… Kasumi… Who are our<i>…  guests?"</i></p><p>The boy visibly  deflated at the question and the girls face turned grumpy. Kasumi  took another sidelong glance at them. "Uh, this would be… Um…"  The eldest Tendo sister hesitated nervously, looking at the boy.</p><p>"Ono." The boy  filled in for her, holding up a hand. Nabiki blinked.</p><p>"Ranko." The  pigtailed girl supplied. Nabiki blinked again.</p><p>"…Saotome."  Kasumi finished in a revenant whisper, confirming her sister's  suspicions. It took everything she had to remain composed, let alone  upright. Her brain latched onto the first, most obvious fact  available to it… Ranma was <i>alive</i>. Some how, against all  odds, the bastard had lived through the impossible… AGAIN. Too many  possibilities and scenarios began to assault her mental process, so  she concentrated on the next most obvious fact—These were his  <i>children.</i> She didn't even bother pursuing the implications  <i>that</i> fact left hanging. There really wasn't any need to,  after all…</p><p>"Wait a minute."  Nabiki stopped short with sudden realization. "Your ages are all  wrong."</p><p>Ono Saotome sighed,  looking down at his sister. "Don't suppose you want to explain  it…?"</p><p>"Forget it,  Onee-chan. I explained it last time." Ranko crossed her arms in  rejection.</p><p>"Damn." The spiky  red-head grumbled. "I'm starting to really hate explaining  temporal mechanics and planular domain theory to the Tendos…"</p><p>"Told ya we shoulda  waited for Mom and Pop." Ranko shrugged oblivious to her brother's  consternation.</p><p>"Sailor Pluto."</p><p>The name caught the  brother and sister's head on a swivel, causing them to stare at  Kasumi with wide eyes. Even Nabiki looked at her sister with  curiosity. "Who did you..."</p><p>"Your mother is  Sailor Pluto." Kasumi stated pleasantly.</p><p>The pair stared at  Kasumi, then each other. Ono spoke first. "You know, I think she's  the first Kasumi that's gotten it right the first time…" Ranko  nodded dumbly.</p><p>"As in the Sailors?"  Nabiki asked with incredulity, to which Kasumi nodded. "The same  Sailors Ukyo hangs out with?" Another nod. "Want to explain that  one to me?"</p><p>"Well, everybody  knows that Sailor Pluto is the Mistress of Time, after all," Kasumi  rationalized. "And it would seem that Ranma's… <i>children</i>  have experience with time travel. Combine that with his association  with the Sailors themselves..." She looked at Ranko. "After all  that, the red eyes and green hair was a dead give-away." Ono, Ranko  and Nabiki stared at the eldest Tendo in silence.</p><p>"She was less creepy  as a vampire…" Ranko mumbled, to which Ono nodded. Even Nabiki  had to agree. Of course, she always did seem to have at least one of  those medical books lying around…</p><p>"Ok, so it's not  exactly a surprise that Saotome is alive…" Nabiki recovered,  ticking the point of on her finger. "But getting married to a  Senshi is a bit of surprise… And the kids… How do you explain  them , Kas-chan?"</p><p>"Hmmm… It probably  something to do with…" She consider the quandary, then turned to  the teens. "Oh my, you must be starved after all that time travel!"</p><p>Giant sweat drops  rolled off the trio's heads, while the brother and sister decided  their father was right… The weirdness just never stops in little  ol' Nerima.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ukyo Kuonji hopped from  one roof to the other, stalking her prey with lethal precision as the  last rays of light evaporated from the evening sky. Everybody had a  purpose in life, and since the death of Ranma Saotome- her fiancée  –Ukyo had two. The first had been her childhood dream… To be an  Okanomiyaki master like her father before her. The second came after  Ranma's death… The single-minded focus of ripping Tokyo's  remaining youma presence to shreds. This pursuit led her to a unique  standing within her family, as she had become the clan's first  Okanomiyaki Demon Hunter.<p>It had, in fact, been  one of the first things she had done after the funeral. The same  combat spatula that had served her faithfully throughout the Fiancée  Wars had been taken to a local shrine and consecrated with holy water  and symbology, turning it into a weapon of divine youma retribution.  Her shiruken spatulas- the same ones she cooked with -had received  similar treatment, and come out of the process with an unexpected  side effect…</p><p>They made for  absolutely <i>divine</i> okanomiyaki.</p><p>Be that as it may, it  was Thursday night and that meant they had only one purpose in  life—to dice youma into very small pieces.</p><p>The Okanomiyaki Master  watched the sickly pink youma scramble from one ally to the next,  aware that it was being pursued, but unable to discern by who or from  where the threat bore. Ukyo slid three mini spatulas out of their  leather bandolier, tucking them between her knuckles. An evil smile  cracked her serious face as the youma rounded a corner and came to a  dead end full of trash and debris.</p><p><i>Now.</i></p><p>Three glimmering lines  of silver sliced through and into the shadowed alley, illuminating it  briefly before burying themselves into a demon that could be loosely  described as female, if it weren't for the scales, fangs and  oversized bone joints that stretched its skin like a bad case of  malnutrition.</p><p>"<i>RRRooRRRoooWWRRLL!"</i></p><p>The beast wailed as the  first shiruken imbedded itself into the left hemisphere of its skull,  taking a sunken, beady eyeball with it. The next two buried  themselves in its ribcage and shoulder respectively, and the creature  fell to the ground thrashing as flesh began to ignite around the  wounds. A claw found the skull rooted shiruken and attempted to pull  it out, only to elicit another howl as the hand closed around the  glowing white spatula. Somehow it endured the pain and yanked the  weapon free, sending it clattering to the ground. The action gained  it little, however, as the charring continued to radiate outward from  the wound like a virus.</p><p>"<i>Wherrrreee are  yoouuuuu!" </i>The gravely female voice hissed in pain as it  desperately sought its assailant. The whistle of wind was the youma's  only reply, and it snapped its head skyward to find a menacing shadow  already dropping down from on high.</p><p>"<i>FOR RAN-CHAN,  BITCH!"</i></p><p>The combat spatula came  down in a perfect arc, replacing the shiruken that had been buried in  its head with a slice that eviscerated the youma from head to toe.  Her weapon and feet touched the earth simultaneously. The youma stood  above her crouch for a moment, before falling apart, sliding length  wise in two. Ukyo Kuonji brought herself back up to her full height  as the separate youma halves flopped to the ground and began to  evaporate in a smoldering mist. The holy symbols on her combat  spatula that had been glowing with the strike faded away as the last  of the demon's life-force drained away into ether. The demon  hunter-chef recovered her mini-shirukens and notched another mark  into the leather bandolier with the last one, making for three  tonight and a career high of fifty two confirmed kills.</p><p>Ukyo flipped the giant  combat spatula around and slid it back to its resting place on her  back, nodding with satisfaction. One of these days the little buggers  were gonna learn not to screw around on her turf, she thought and  turned on a heel, leaping back up to the roof. She extended her  senses for a good few miles in every direction, failing to sense any  more of the tainted creatures. While it was good she wasn't sensing  them, it was also odd that she wasn't sensing anybody else.  Normally at least a couple of Sailors would be on patrol tonight, but  all she could feel was the concentration of power on the far end of  Juuban. The apartment, of course. So why were they all sitting around  back there?</p><p>She had done her share  for tonight. Time to find out.</p><p>It took less than ten  minutes to transverse the distance at high speed as she retraced the  path she had taken so many times before to the Senshi's doorstep.  She dropped down from another rooftop and stepped up to the apartment  with a knuckle poised to rap on the door. The finger paused inches  from the surface as Ukyo cocked her head, listening to the sounds  coming from the inside. Some sort of commotion. A party? Argument?  Her hand slipped around the doorknob, confident that the extenuating  circumstances would permit her uninvited entry.</p><p>What she walked into  was chaos, as familiar faces argued back and forth over some  incomprehensible topic around Chibi and some kid— Ukyo's thought  process froze as a vision tore open sealed memories from the past…  She could only see the back of the boy's head, but the hair color  and style began ripping open old wounds left and right. It <i>couldn't</i>  be. The boy turned around and Ukyo's heart nearly stopped.</p><p><i>It was impossible</i>.</p><p>"Ran-chan…" She  whispered. The kid in front of her was nearly a mirror image of her  fiancée, had his biological clock been wound back five or so  years. The hair... Face… Even a ponytail like her childhood friend  from so long ago. The eyes…. Ukyo blinked.</p><p>The eyes were <i>purple</i>.</p><p>"Hey Auntie Uuks."  The boy smiled, causing Ukyo to frown. Ran-chan didn't have purple  eyes. Magic de-aging mushrooms, she could believe, but this… She  squinted at the boy and began to notice subtle differences in his  features. This was <i>not</i> Ranma. Close, but not close enough to  fool <i>her</i> of all people. Her mind came to the only logical  conclusion.</p><p>"<i>YOUMA!</i>" She  snarled, bringing the combat spatula to bear. The boy's eyes  widened and all the arguing around her instantly stopped.</p><p>"Uhhh…"</p><p>"You may be able to  fool the girls here, but you ain't foolin' <i>me.</i>" The  shining spatula twirled in her hand, and the chef took an attack  stance. The purple eyed boy took a step back, looking frantically for  an escape route. She was blocking the only one. "And for  impersonating the most important person in my life, it's time for  you to die." She paused, an evil smile taking over her face.  "<i>Painfully.</i>"</p><p>"Ukyo, wait!"  Usagi's intervention came a moment too late as Ukyo lurched  forward, raising the edge of her spatula high.</p><p>"You're gonna <i>DIE</i>  little demon!"</p><p>"Eep!"</p><p>The weapon came down  and was lost in a flash of purple light, blinding anybody looking in  that direction. The flash didn't stop physics from happening and  instead of the gratifying mushy thud Ukyo expected to feel, a  cracking vibration greeted her grip as the giant utensil sliced an  empty chair in half and gutted the floor beneath it. Ami winced at  the property damage while Usa jumped back in horror.</p><p>"Where the little  youma bastard go?" Ukyo inquired, scanning the apartment wildly  while her eyes readjusted to more normal level of lighting.  Everything still seemed to have a purplish hue, however.</p><p>"Real good, Ukyo…"  Usagi stepped forward with a put-out look on her face. Ukyo's face  was writ with incomprehension. "You just tried to split Ranma's  youngest in half."</p><p>The Okanomiyaki master  had only a moment to analyze her words before fainting dead away.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma Saotome, heir to  the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts stood on the property wall,  looking down into the Saotome household. Beside him stood Setsuna,  the Last Princess of Pluto and Guardian of Time, her hand entwined in  his as the dusk glow faded from the night sky.<p>"Be it ever so  humble…" Ranma spoke softly, causing Setsuna to give his hand a  soft squeeze. Silence drift between them as the sight sparked  memories in Ranma head, most of those being early childhood. As a  young man, however, he had spent less than a year there and now the  only thing that made it home was the people therein, specifically his  mother. She was a person he hadn't seen since five years old after  being spirited away on a martial arts training voyage, and once he  was finally ready to begin life anew with her her again, was spirited  away on another adventure.</p><p>That one lasted two decades.</p><p>The martial artist gave  the structure another once over, confirming that his mother was, in  fact the only person within the house. It didn't take a genius to  figure out where his old man was. He lifted Setsuna's hand and they  both hopped down from the wall and walked across the yard to the  door. Ranma took a deep breath.</p><p>"I can do this,  Love." Red eyes shown at him with sympathy. "You know what's  going to happen if you knock on that door."</p><p>Ranma took a deep  breath, and his hand poised just beyond the door's surface. "Yeah,  but this is something I gotta do for myself." Setsuna nodded and  stepped back.</p><p><i>knock-knock-knock!</i></p><p>The pair waited a  precious few moments before light footsteps could be heard making  their way to the door. "One moment…!" The muffled female  voice came from the inside and soon the doorknob was turning. A  middle aged woman in a conservative dress and long chestnut hair  answered the door, smiling warmly at her visitors. "Oh my,  you're a very nice looking couple. May I help you?"</p><p>"Hi Mom…"  Ranma replied carefully, and Nodoka Saotome's eyes instantly widened.</p><p>"You're… not…"  The redhead's breathing Quickened, leading to one inevitable  conclusion. Nodoka's eyes widened one last time and promptly rolled  into the back of her head. Her body slackened and fell to the earth,  where Ranma caught her deftly before she met it. Ranma looked fondly  on his mother, who he hadn't seen in twenty years, and lifted  her back up in his arms.</p><p>"Told you so."  Setsuna shrugged and let herself in through the open door, Ranma  following close behind, carrying his mother.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah. Rub  it in." Ranma found the nearest sofa and set her down gently,  looking on her unconscious form. "Guess I'll fix us something to  eat while we wait."</p><p>Fifteen minutes later,  Nodoka Saotome's eyes fluttered open. She propped herself up from the  sofa, recalling a dream she had had many times before… That being  Ranma still alive and not a fallen hero. Her vision cleared and she  took stock of her surrounding, her gaze immediately falling upon her  smartly dressed, green-haired visitor sitting in the opposite chair,  reading one of her magazines. She coughed slightly to get the woman's  attention and red eyes flashed upon her.</p><p>"Good evening,  Mrs. Saotome…" She smiled. "Sorry to have startled you."</p><p>Nodoka simply looked  upon the young woman curiously. "Did I…? Who are you?"</p><p>The woman stood up and  walked over to Nodoka, who was testing her own balance. She looked  upon the young woman and felt the briefest moment of envy. Not that  she was jealous of her figure, which was exquisite, or her  beautifully exotic hair, or the intelligence that sparkled in her  eyes. No, she was jealous that her son couldn't have known such a  specimen of womanhood.</p><p>"My name is  Setsuna… Saotome." The woman smiled once more, reaching her  hand out to encompass Nodoka's, who stared at her with  incomprehension. Saotome? How was she a Saotome? Unless Genma-</p><p>"I'm your son's  wife."</p><p>The eyes widened, and  for a split second Setsuna was afraid that the woman in front of her  would pass out again. Then the mouth fell into a silent "ooooh!"  She stood there, frozen in time for a moment before lurching forward,  capturing the unprepared Mistress of Time in bear hug. "Daughter!"  The daughter in question gasped for breath and suddenly found herself  released, the middle aged woman's eyes shining on her intently. "Is  that my son I saw at the door then?"</p><p>"It is."  Setsuna answered with a smile. "He's in the kitchen fixing us  something to eat."</p><p>"Don't you cook?"  Nodoka asked, her finely tuned sense concerning womanhood tripped.</p><p>Setsuna shrugged.  "While I can cook, it's his hobby, not mine. Probably picked it  up from you." Nodoka's eyes gained a happy, thoughtful light as  Setsuna deftly sidestepped that particular pitfall. Her husband had  warned her in advance of what to expect from his mother and smiled  mentally at having successfully diverted her attention. That, and it  helped to have experience with the other Nodoka's even if none of  them were quite the same as this one. In fact, this one seemed  downright sedate compared to the demon hunter of their last jump, or  Evil sorceress from a plane best left forgotten. Of course, all of  them wanted to know one thing…</p><p>"Where are my  grandchildren?" She peered around the room expectantly, mildly  disappointed to find herself and Setsuna as the only occupants.</p><p>"Well, one is with  his girlfriend in Juuban and the other two are probably at the Tendo  dojo as we speak." The Mistress of Time detailed, and the light  in Nodoka's eyes shown even brighter. Frankly, it was beginning to  unnerve Setsuna. In fact, the Saotome matriarch unnerved her every  time they met, which was quite a feat considering the Guardian of  Time was just this side of three thousand years old. Luckily,  reprieve came in the form of her husband, who stuck his head out the  kitchen door.</p><p>"Dinner will be  ready in a few, Set-chan. Is she-" Ranma cut his inquiry short  as those shining orbs rotated from his wife onto him.</p><p>"MY MANLY SON!"  Setsuna's time stop couldn't have done any better, as one moment she  was standing next to the Senshi and the next she was wrapped around  Ranma, who thanked God he hadn't come out with dishes in hand.  "You'reAliveYou'reAliveYou're AliveYou'reAlive!" She paused  only to take another deep breath. "My manly son is alive!"  another pause and her expression brightened even further, if at all  possible. "WITH GRANDBABIES!" A sweatdrop rolled off the  side of Setsuna's head, an action Ranma might of mirrored if he  wasn't busy getting the life squeezed out of him. As it was, it took  him a minute to break the half nelson.</p><p>"Uh, yeah Mom, I'm  alive." Ranma scratched the back of his head and she lurched  forward again, embracing him in another fierce hug. "Gack!"</p><p>"But how! That  nice Moon girl and the Amazons said…" She frowned looking her  manly son over. "…and you've matured!" It was obvious  that the young man in front of her had filled out in both form and  definition, as well as adding a couple inches to his height. If she  wasn't mistaken, he was around 26 or so now… Which didn't make  sense since he had only been gone for six months. Whatever the result  of that absence, his lean, muscular frame indicated that he had  undoubtedly kept up in the Art.</p><p>Ranma slumped, and  glanced over at Setsuna. "Don't suppose you want explain it?"</p><p>Setsuna rolled her  eyes. "Forget it. I explained it last time."</p><p>"Damn," Ranma  grumbled. Ono Saotome wasn't the only one getting tired of explaining  temporal mechanics and planular domain theory. He looked at his Mom  and smiled. "Ok, have a seat. It goes like this… We  successfully planted the bomb in the pocket universe and were  evacuating everybody but ran into a problem…"</p><p>"Specifically,  upwards around twenty thousand youma." Setsuna added, to which  Ranma nodded.</p><p>"And we had to  find a way to get out before being overran." Nodoka hung on  every word of her son's harrowing escape as he continued. "I  unleashed a devastating technique that gave us some breathing room,  but effectively cut me off from our escape route. You really don't  want to know how close I came to buying it there."</p><p>"What happened  then…?" Nodoka leaned forward, concern showing in her eyes.</p><p>"Then a goddess  happened by and saved my ass." He looked over at Setsuna, who  was blushing madly. "Instead of getting me to the escape route,  she brought the escape route to me. We hit the wormhole running, but  the bomb went off just as we entered it, creating…"</p><p>"…A time-space  improbability juncture." Setsuna took over naturally.  "Basically, the Elerium blast wave sent a power spike through  the wormhole resonate structure, sending it branching across no less  than 582 planes of existence."</p><p>Ranma noted the glazed  over look in his mother's eyes and interpreted his wife's  explanation. "We got lost on the way back."</p><p>Nodoka nodded as if the  preceding had actually made sense. "And along the way you fell  madly in love, had grandbabies and lived happily ever after."</p><p>Setsuna blinked. "Um,  I guess if you want the abbreviated version, yes."</p><p>Nodoka smiled knowingly  as if everything had gone according to plan, which only served to  unnerve Ranma's wife even more. "And when can I expect to meet  them?"</p><p>"Well, the Tendo's  are the-" The Senshi of Pluto cocked her head, as if she were a  dog listening to a high pitched note. "On second thought, you  may be meeting one right about…"</p><p><i>PhooOOmP!</i></p><p>"ACK! Don't kill  me Auntie Ukyo!"</p><p>The frantic plea was  accompanied by a purple burst of light, and by the time Nodoka had  rubbed her eyes clear of it, a thirteen year old boy was crouched in  the middle of her living room, covering his head as if the sky was  about to fall on him. Nodoka stared at the boy curiously, who was  only now beginning to peak out of his protective shell.</p><p>Setsuna shook her head,  letting loose and exasperated sigh. "Don't tell me Auntie Ukyo  tried to split you in half <i>again</i>…?" She turned to Ranma  with a frown. "You really have to talk to her about that, hun."</p><p>Ranma arched an  eyebrow. "<i>I do.</i> In every single damn reality we visit."  He looked down at the boy, who was just regaining awareness of his  surroundings. "Been causing trouble again, Akira?"</p><p>"Naw, just was  visitin' Usa-chan when- GACK!" The purple-eyed boy never knew  what hit him as Nodoka Saotome rode in on full stealth and proceed to  turn the boy into boney pulp.</p><p>"Aren't you just  soooo CUUUTE!" She shook the boy around as he proceeded with  all his skill to defy her grasp, a task at which he was remarkably  unsuccessful in accomplishing. She thrust the boy out in front of her  suddenly, nearly giving him whiplash. "Let's have a look at you!  OOOoh, you look just like Ranma when he was your age! And the eyes!  They're so exotic!"</p><p>"Oh, uh, heyas  Grandma…" Akira had all but recovered from his shock,  recognizing the person who now held him. "Uh, yeah. Blue and  red."</p><p>Nodoka blinked. "You  know who I am? Red and blue?"</p><p>"Of course I know  ya, Grandma!" Akira smiled, pulling the adult into a hug of his  own. "The eyes. Mom and Dad."</p><p>Nodoka smiled, but a  curious expression inhabited her face. "How do you know who I  am, child?"</p><p>"Easy, I-"  Akira stopped short, catching his father's warning look. "Oh  yeah. Forgot about that. Uh, nice to meet you Grandma!"</p><p>She cast a skeptical  look up at her son, who quickly wiped his face clean of anything  incriminating. "He knows everything about you, Mom."</p><p>She cast him one last  look, before returning to the boy. "And how old are you?"</p><p>"Thirteen."</p><p>Nodoka did some quick  calculations and found herself staring at the boy, then Ranma, then  Setsuna. "Son, exactly how old are you?"</p><p>Ranma frowned. The  question hadn't been so bad early on in his travels with Setsuna, as  the age difference had never been noticeable. But after twenty  years on the road with Setsuna and the children, it was becoming an  increasingly common question. "Thirty eight, Mom."</p><p>Nodoka simply stared at  her son. And stared. "You… You've aged well, son."</p><p>"Ain't nothing  compared to Set-chan he-Oof!" The martial artist took an elbow  to the ribs and lapsed into silence, rubbing his mid-section  painfully.</p><p>"What the baka  here is trying to say," She overtook the conversation  forcefully. "Is that we have actually been gone nearly twenty  years."</p><p>"Twenty <i>years?</i>"  Nodoka mouthed in disbelief. "But… but <i>how?</i>"</p><p>Ranma and Setsuna  nodded and Nodoka slowly released her grip on Akira. "The actual  journey took us twenty years, but given my unique, eh, <i>gifts</i>,  I was able to return us within six months of our disappearance while  negating the effects of your son's aging."</p><p>"Time travel?"  Nodoka blinked, trying to grasp the concept. "Is that <i>possible?</i>"</p><p>"Mom, I turn into  a girl when splashed with cold water, you tell me." Ranma  replied dryly, and Nodoka shrugged, conceding the point with a nod.  "But yeah, it's possible. Another one of Set-chan's gifts is  that I don't age normally."</p><p>"I see."  Nodoka nodded. "So if I have all of this correct, you've been  gone for about twenty years, are thirty eight years old even though  you look twenty-five, married a magical girl and have three  grandchildren?"</p><p>Setsuna nodded her own  affirmation and Ranma simply said, "Yah."</p><p>"MY MANLY SON!"</p><p>Needless to say, a  fierce glomping followed that <i>none</i> escaped.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The shadows of night  were busy claiming the land around the Tendo dojo as Ukyo Kuonji  stalked through them. She was on a mission, and there would be no  staying her purpose. Strange things were afoot tonight and she had to  warn the Tendos, especially if their was a chance in hell that Ranma  was alive. If there was there was one place he would eventually turn  up with absolute certainty, it was here and she intended to be there  when he did.<p>She leapt over the  compound's wall with ease and stepped up to the back door, her hand  pausing at the doorknob. She cocked an ear to more precisely discern  the conversation inside.</p><p>"And there you  were running around with that sword," Now who was that? Ukyo  wondered as she turned the knob softly. Some new girl? "like you  were possessed or something!"</p><p>"You can't be  serious." That was Nabiki's voice, she noted. The dry, doubting  tone could only be hers. "I don't even <i>own </i>a sword."</p><p>"Swear to God,  Auntie." A lower voice continued. Definitely a guy. Wait…  Auntie? "You were chasin' ol' Grandpa like crazy! Chop! Chop!  Chop!"</p><p>'Chop chop chop?' Ukyo  twitched as she stepped through the hallway. While chasing the old  Panda down and serving up panda steaks did paint a lovely image, she  just couldn't see Nabiki with any sort of weaponry, let alone a  possessed sword.</p><p>"Oh my,"  Kasumi started, looking over the teens shoulders. "We weren't  expecting you, Ukyo-chan."</p><p>The Okanomiyaki Master  now stared on the strange group, and a familiar wave of deja'vu  rippled through her. Kasumi and Nabiki were familiar of course. She  saw them at least once a month, more if they stopped by her  restaurant. No, the deja'vu was born of the teens next to them, one  spiky haired red-headed boy and one green haired pig-tailed girl who  was a dead ringer for Ranma's female aspect. The red hair on the boy  was telling enough and if she could have combined the styling, her  best friend's girl type would have been sitting right there in front  of her. Still, the girl, like the boy she had seen a mere fifteen  minutes ago, wasn't an exact match to the faces she knew too well.  This Rankos' features were sharper and if her sitting proportions  were any indication, slightly less busty, even if the ages were  fairly close.</p><p>"Let me guess…"  Ukyo pointed to the kids, looking at Kasumi. "More of Ranma's  kids?"</p><p>Kasumi nodded  cheerfully and Nabiki picked up on the slight twist of grammar.  "'More' kids?" She stared at the two who had been snacking  on Kasumi's homemade cookies. They paused under the scrutiny.</p><p>Ranko shrugged. "Musta  been Akira." She a paused looking, looking up at the chef  expectantly. "You didn't try to split 'Kira-kun in half again,  did you, Aunt Uuks?"</p><p>Ukyo blinked. As a  matter of fact she had. With that thought, she snapped. <i>"How  the hell do you know so much about us!" </i></p><p>"Think I can  explain that, Ucchan."</p><p>She whirled around at  the all too familiar voice and found him, Ranma Saotome. There were  differences. He had aged. Slightly taller. But Ukyo knew beyond a  shadow of a doubt. This was the real thing. He was exactly how she  had pictured them growing up together as a couple. The chef was so  caught up in the moment that her brain barely registered the two  women next to him, and she slammed into him hard enough to pin him to  the doorway.</p><p>"RANCHAN!"  Ranma let out the slightest of 'oofs' as he was nailed to the door  and locked in a fierce embrace that he readily accepted. It had been  a long time for Ranma too. Even though nearly every reality they had  visited had an Ucchan, they were all different in some intrinsic way.  This one was <i>his</i>. "Oh God, I thought I lost you! I  thought I…" The rest of her words became intelligible as she  lapsed into incoherent sobbing.</p><p>"I missed you too,  Ucchan…" Ranma simply stroked her head as she cried in his  shoulder. Setsuna smiled and the kids collected around her, now  numbering three. The two additions didn't go unnoticed.</p><p>"Is that Ono? And  Ranko?" Both children turned from the beautiful scene to one  they had come to dread over the many realities they had visited. The  light shining in Nodoka Saotome's eyes had an unnatural gleam to it.  "GRANDBABIES!"</p><p>"Ack! Gramma! Cut  it out!" A pitched female voice hollered from one arm while the  arm squirmed with the redheaded boy.</p><p>"No! Not  agaaaain!"</p><p>The commotion was  enough to break Ukyo from her joyful reunion and stare as Nodoka  wrestled with the teens. "You all better now, Auntie Ukyo?"  Her sight came down to find the little Ranma with purple eyes she had  attacked earlier.</p><p>"Almost, kiddo."  She smiled faintly, then looked back up to Ranma. "Almost. You  <i>really</i> have some explaining to do, Sugar." Her eyes then  turned to the woman who was watching with amusement as the two other  children had the life crushed out of them. "Got somebody you  want to introduce me to?"</p><p>"Eh…" From  experience, Ranma knew this situation could break any number of ways  from grudging acceptance to outright violence. Not that his wife  couldn't handle anything the chef could literally dish out, but it'd  be a shame if he'd have to subdue his best friend. "Ukyo, meet  Setsuna… My wife."</p><p>Silence hung in the air  for a few precious moments as the two sized up one another. In a  detached part of her brain, Ukyo could see what might have attracted  her…ex-fiancée to the woman. She could have given any of the  fiancées a run for their money in the looks department alone,  not to mention having a figure to die for, something she evidentially  had no trouble showing off. Between the green hair and red eyes,  exotic was definitely one word for her. Woman… The word hung in her  mind as a statement in itself. This was by no means a girl or a teen,  and that put her in a class by herself. Under any other  circumstances, she might have thought Ranma seduced by her maturity,  until coupled with the fact that the Ran-chan next to her was nearly  the same age. Somewhere in his six month journey back to Nerima he  had aged nearly ten years, acquired a wife and three children, the  oldest of which looked about as old as Ranma used to be.</p><p>The mathematical  discontinuity helped to blunt most of her jealousy.</p><p>"Um, nice to meet  you…" She strained. "I guess."</p><p>Setsuna inclined her  head graciously. It was probably as good a greeting as she was going  to get at the moment. "Likewise. I've been looking forward to  meeting Ranma's best friend."</p><p>"And fiancée."  Ukyo added, somewhat bitterly. Setsuna held her silence while the  girl turned to study Ranma further. "What the hell happened to  you Ran-chan?"</p><p>"Good question."</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>Ranma now had three  sets of eye balls riveted to him and he sighed. "Goddamn  temporal mechanics."</p><p>"Ranma-chan never  seems to have a problem with temporal theory." Setsuna mentioned  with a mischievous smile that boardered just this side of mysterious  to everybody else watching the pair curiously. Ranma scowled.</p><p>"Oh sure, laugh it  up." The pig tailed martial artist commented dryly before  turning to the others. "I'll explain, but it's long and I don't  wanna repeat it five hundred times. Where's Akane and the parents?"</p><p>"Father and Mister  Saotome have taken the night out and Akane…" Kasumi let an  uncharacteristic pause creep into her answer. "Um, Akane is…"</p><p>"On a date."  Nabiki finished with her usual consideration for others. Ranma  blinked. A date? The Tendo held out her hand expectantly. "Two  thousand yen."</p><p>Ranma was still  stumbling over the fact that Akane was on a date of her own volition  when his wife cut in. "Now, now. We don't want to ruin the  surprise for my husband."</p><p>Nabiki turned her  attention to the red-eyed woman, who was supposedly the martial  artist's wife with a mixture surprise and doubt. "You know?"</p><p>"My dear, I am the  Senshi of Time." She chided Nabiki as if lecturing a small  child. "I'm the one who arranged it, after all."</p><p>Nabiki's eyes widened  and the color drained from her face. It was, of course, impossible.  But the Senshi of Time… had hooked her sister up… with… <i>that  person</i>. The Tendo took a step back, realizing that this woman's  manipulations not only eclipsed hers own by several magnitudes but  they were outright devious, if not downright perverted in nature.</p><p>"You <i>didn't.</i>"</p><p>"I did."</p><p>Nabiki stared  incredulously at the green haired woman for a moment before her eye  began twitching. Slowly, she moved to the living room seat furthest  from the Senshi, who simply smile serenely.</p><p>Ranma glanced from  sister to wife. "I'm almost tempted to take you up on the offer  now, Nabs."</p><p>Nabiki shook her head  emphatically. "Uh-uh. The deal is withdrawn, Saotome." She  continued to eye the Senshi of Time warily.</p><p>Ranma watched the  trepidation pool in the middle sister's eyes, and turned back to his  pleasantly smiling wife. He sighed. "I knew it. This one is much  worse than Tau Ceti, ain't it?"</p><p>Setsuna gave him a  friendly peck on the cheek. "My dear husband, I have<i> no</i>  idea what you're talking about."</p><p>Nabiki shivered from  across the room. This was her idea of a <i>present </i>to Ranma? No  <i>fucking</i> way was she going to cross <i>that </i>woman. Or  Ranma. Or his children. Ever. Ranma, on the other hand, seemed to  accept it as a fact of life, which it probably was, she realized. You  get to know somebody pretty well after nearly twenty years of  marriage, right? Well, whatever. Nabiki let her eyes float across the  room's other players. The new kid was definitely younger, had weird  purple eyes but otherwise looked like a smaller version of Ranma  minus the pigtail. Been busy, she snorted mentally. Her eyes  continued and stopped on her older sister. Nabiki frowned at the  unnatural sparkle she had just noticed in Kasumi's eyes. They were  directed on Ranma's person. Nabiki's thoughts stumbled. Oh you've <i>got</i>  to be kidding… No, it makes sense, the middle Tendo corrected  herself. He may have not been when he first arrived three years ago,  but Ranma Saotome was definitely a man's man now. She could see why  Kasumi was paying all kinds of attention now. With his well defined  body and matured looks, he had moved from her little brother to a  high school girls wet dream, let alone somebody would show up on  Kasumi's radar… As if he didn't elicit that reaction in half  Furikan's population already.</p><p>"The nerve of him,  Tendo!" A gruff voice braked with indignation, cutting through  the idle chit chat that the family had been engaged in. The door  opened, admitting one balding, fattened martial artist and his  friend, a skinnier, mustachioed man with black hair. "Kicking us  out like that!"</p><p>"I thought you  said you paid off the bar tab, old friend…?" The skinnier man  questioned as the two moved deeper into the house and into the sight  of the others.</p><p>"Well, I, uh… Oh  look! You have guests, Tendo!" Genma Saotome dodged the inquiry,  successfully diverting his long time friend's attention.</p><p>Soun Tendo stopped in  the hall and studied the strangers mingling with his family. "It  would appear you're correct Saotome." The children were what his  eyes fell upon first, noting two his daughters age and a third in his  early teens. His expert eye, however, noted they were all martial  artists. All the better, a part of his dim thought process noted,  always on the lookout for potential suitors for his daughters now  that Saotome couldn't hold up his end of their old bargain. Not  through any fault of his own, of course. You couldn't ask for  anything better than a son who saves the world. The younger boy was  too young, the girl was, well, a girl, but the spiky haired red would  do just…</p><p>"Nodoka-chan, what  are you doing here?" Genma blinked, skipping over the strangers  directly to his wife, who was presently conversing with a green  haired young lady.</p><p>"Oh, I'm glad  you're home early," Nodoka turned to the new arrivals, motioning  the younger lady to her side. "I'd like to introduce you to  somebody very important."</p><p>Genma's eyes narrowed.  She didn't have the honor blade, but she had the smile. That  mischievous smile. On average, he didn't like what the smile held in  store for him, but it was far too late to extricate himself now. "And  who is that?"</p><p>"Our daughter  in-law!"</p><p>Genma blinked and  immediacy began to wonder what wild scheme his wife was involved in  now. The boy's death had rattled her to be sure, but this was a bit  beyond the norm. He studied the woman at her side and wondered how he  was going to break the news that there was no husband to be or  engagements to be had. "Look, don't know what my wife has told  you but there's no way you can be our daughter in-law."</p><p>Setsuna blinked  innocently. "And why is that… father?"</p><p>The bald martial artist  winced. Dammit, he was too late and she was too ensnared in his  wife's machinations. "Because we don't have a son to be wed to."</p><p>"Is that right?"</p><p>Genma knew that voice.  Knew it well. He spun around and found the visage of his son, older,  but his son none the less. There was only one thing that came to mind  as he ran into the young man, wrapping him up in a fierce bear hug.  "Ungrateful boy! What do you think you're doing, dying like  that! You, um, had your mother worried stiff!"</p><p>Ranma endured the  throttling before breaking the embrace easily, allowing his father to  soak in the details. Soun stepped to his side, studying the presumed  dead martial artist. "Your son is… grown up, Saotome." He  frowned at the implication. On second thought, Ranma wasn't  completely outside the range to be engaged to his daughters,  specifically Kasumi.</p><p>"Indeed he has,  Tendo!" Genma grinned from ear to ear, taking the fact that  Ranma looked nearly a decade older with a grain of salt, yet another  one of the mysterious circumstance that plagued the boy's existence  on a daily basis. Then he gained a thoughtful countenance, as if  picking up on his friend's concern. In truth, their mental processes  were never too far from mirroring one another on a certain topic.  "Hmmm, a bit too old to marry your Akane or Nabiki now. I  think-"</p><p>Ranma stepped back with  bland look on his face. "I think you missed an important plot  development." Genma and Soun blinked. They had missed something?  A green haired young lady stepped up to his side. "My wife  Setsuna Saotome."</p><p>"How do you do  Mister Saotome?" She inclined her head gracefully and it took  Genma a moment to recover.</p><p>"Well you can  always-"</p><p>"<i>And</i> our  three children Ono, Ranko and Akira." Ranma beckoned their  offspring over, who lined up around them. Genma and his partner were  left speechless. Ranma was married. With children. How do you force  an engagement through that? Luckily, one person had the answer.</p><p>"Kasumi will just  have to become Ranma's mistress." Nodoka stated with ineffable  calm. The reactions varied. Kasumi instantly lapsed into a glowing  blush, which might have had something to do with the fantasies  creeping into her head. Ranma twitched. No matter how many times this  happened, he'd never get used to it. Setsuna simply sighed with a  frown. Nodoka's were all the same when it came to the driving need  for grandbabies.</p><p>"No mistresses,  Mom." Ranma replied with a calm born of numerous exposures to  this exact same situation. "Got a wife, got kids."</p><p>"But…"</p><p>"No buts."  Ranma stated firmly. It had taken him several realities with Nodoka's  single minded focus to build up that level of forceful resistance to  his mother's relentless focus, but he had finally developed a healthy  resistance to it; even the saddened face that now reflected upon him.  Even as Ranma stopped one of the Nermian gears of fate cold, another  one loosed itself upon his life once more.</p><p>"That's it!"  Genma shouted. "Fear not, Tendo, the schools can still be  joined!"</p><p>All eyes turned on the  elder Saotome and Ranma felt the first twinges of fear. Genma's  random spurts of inspiration were something to be on guard for. They  normally led to random chaos and problems for his son more often then  not, and Ranma wasn't looking for any more to call his own.</p><p>"Look, Pops…"</p><p>"Indeed, Saotome?"  Soun leaned forward with interest, ignoring Ranma completely.</p><p>"It's right her in  front of us, old friend!" Genma smiled confidentially.  "Obviously the boy is married. Can't do anything about that…  But his son, however…"</p><p>Ranma's gut turned to  solid ice. Setsuna frowned. How they could not have seen this one  coming was totally and completely beyond them. Soun Tendo's blank  look persisted for a moment before realization dawned on him. "You're  right!" Both parents were now staring intently at the redheaded  Ono Saotome.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Run." His  father whispered. "Run while there's still-"</p><p>"Ono, grandson!"  Soun latched on to one arm and Genma latched on to the other. "Am  I to understand you're single?"</p><p>"Well…?"</p><p>"Excellent news,  grandson!" Genma piped cheerfully. "You're engaged!"</p><p>"WHAT?" Ono  shrieked, trying to wrestle his way out of their grip. "How the  hell am I engaged! Pop, what the hell? To who!"</p><p>"Talk some sense  into him before I vaporize them, hun." Setsuna growled, her red  eyes flashing with threat.</p><p>Ranma took Setsuna's  advice to heart. "Look old man, you ain't engagin' nobody  agai-"</p><p>"To my daughters,  of course!" Soun replied happily. "This is my daughter  Nabiki, she's eighteen and Kasumi, who is twenty." Soun directed  his attention to the girls in question. Nabiki was now staring  daggers into her father while Kasumi's mouth simply hung open.  "Choose the one you want. She's your fiancée."</p><p>The young Ono Saotome  was now looking at his grandparent in total disbelief as Nabiki  turned to her father. "You know, I think Kasumi would be a much  better-"</p><p>"Oh no, Nabiki."  Kasumi cut her sister off politely before she could get going. "While  I want to marry an Ono, I'd prefer mine to be a doctor." She  paused, her face turning a bright pink. "Oh my, did I just say  that?"</p><p>"I'm <i>not</i>  marrying a martial arts jock, sister." Nabiki stated.</p><p>"Who are you  callin' a martial arts jock!" Ono bristled from near by and the  grandparents laughed heartily.</p><p>"See, old friend?"  Genma stated with a wide smile. "They're a perfect couple  already!"</p><p>"Indeed they are,  Saotome!" Soun replied with an equally wide smile.</p><p>"Have I ever  mentioned that your parents are complete and utter morons, Ran-chan?"  Ukyo leaned in and Ranma nodded soberly.</p><p>"At this rate,  he'll have all my old fiancées engaged to him in no time."  Ranma observed dryly as his son and Nabiki argued back and forth.</p><p>"Though the red  hair does make him kinda cute." Ukyo replied wistfully. "And  since I can't have you…" She looked at her best friend, who  now wore a horrified expression. She smiled evilly.</p><p>"Gotcha."</p><p>Ranma shook his head.  "That wasn't very nice."</p><p>"Consider it  payback for hauling off, adding ten years and getting married on me."  Ukyo replied with mock indignation.</p><p>"You don't know  the half of it." Ranma muttered, earning another look from the  chef. "Tell you when Akane-"</p><p>"We're home!"</p><p>"-gets here."  Ranma blinked as the familiar voice rang through the air.</p><p>Akane Tendo stepped  into the room, pausing as she noticed all the people. The tall girl  behind her almost ran into her when she stopped and both were now  looking around curiously. Ranma paled. It wasn't the sight of Akane  Tendo that produced the reaction. No, it was the girl she was holding  hands with. She was a tall, busty brunette, the martial artist  observed and not just a little on the attractive side.</p><p>She was also <i>fully  equipped</i>, if memory served.</p><p>Akane had yet to catch  sight of him, and he turned to his wife, who was barely stifling her  giggles. "You didn't…"</p><p>"Consider it an  early birthday present." Setsuna smiled evilly and Ranma  twitched.</p><p>"You fixed her up  with <i>Makoto Kashiwagi?</i>!" Ranma could barely keep his  voice below a squeal.</p><p>His wife's evil grin  lapsed into a patient smile. "It was the least I could do after  having called my husband a pervert so many times." Ranma arched  an eyebrow and Setsuna continued happily. "Besides, Makato was  probably the best one I could have chosen for her."</p><p>"Really."  Ranma folded his arms and eyed her skeptically.</p><p>"Really."  Setsuna stated with pleasant certainty. "You don't even want to  know how many boyfriends Akane would have broken if I hadn't-"</p><p>"RANMA!"</p><p>The martial artist's  head turned on a swivel to find Akane Tendo gaping at him. "Hey  Akane. What's new?"</p><p>"You're alive!"  She jumped forward, practically mowing down anybody in her path to  the pigtailed man. This ended with the inevitable "GACK!"  being squeezed out of him.</p><p>"Oof! Now that  ain't exactly new, Akane-chan."</p><p>Silence pervaded the  room as everybody watched the reunion between old friends take place.  Akane held on to Ranma for another moment before fully taking in the  details of his seemingly impossible change, stating the obvious.  "You've… Changed?"</p><p>Ranma smirked, glancing  over her shoulder to the brunette waiting patiently for an  explanation. "And you stole my fiancée."</p><p>Akane blushed.  "B-Baka."</p><p>"Sometimes."  Akane turned her attention to the new speaker, the red eyed, green  haired woman. "I'm Setsuna Saotome… Ranma's wife."</p><p>Akane blinked, looking  from martial artist to the woman and back. "Wife?"</p><p>Ranma nodded and  motioned his children over. "These are my three kids. Ono and Ranko, seventeen and Akira, thirteen." He watched  incomprehension spread across her face. "I've been gone twenty  year, Akane-chan."</p><p>"But you just…  We had the funeral…"</p><p>"Nope." Ranma  explained gently. "We got kicked around on our way back. Took me  and Set-chan twenty years and change just to get back to this  point."</p><p>Akane looked from man  to woman. "But… how!"</p><p>"I'm Sailor  Pluto." Setsuna admitted. "Time travel is one of my gifts."</p><p>"You… you  married a <i>magical girl</i>!" Akane gasped and Ranma couldn't  help but to smile.</p><p>"Yeah, tell me  about it." Ranma admitted, earning an elbow from his spouse.</p><p>"And had kids?"  Akane stared at the three, barely comprehending how people who looked  her age could possibly be Ranma's kids. The family resemblance was  definitely there. The one called Ono had inherited his father's  bright red girl-type hair in spikes, but held a lot of the sharper  facial features of his mother, as did his sister, who, aside from the  slightly off face and green hair, was nearly a mirror of her father's  curse. The name Ranko was more than appropriate. Then there was the  little one, Akira. That one was a mirror image of his father at  thirteen, save the iridescent purple eyes.</p><p>"Personally, I  can't believe you had three." Ukyo leaned in and Setsuna  shrugged.</p><p>"I only had two."</p><p>Ukyo blinked and the  statement hung in the air as the room's occupants digested it.  Ranma's eyes flicked over to his wife. "Oh, you just had to  bring that up."</p><p>"Payback for the  age comment earlier." Setsuna smiled as realization dawned on  Nabiki first.</p><p>"Is she saying…"  Nabiki stared at the martial artist, then an evil grin crept to her  face. "Oh no. This is too priceless!"</p><p>Ukyo watched as the  realization found her, then Akane, who was now slack jawed. "You…  You, <i>pervert!</i>"</p><p>"You sure you're  the one to be making that call, A-chan?" Ukyo recovered from her  shock, looking at the youngest Tendo, who instantly developed a  bright pink blush. Genma gasped and Soun paled slightly.</p><p>Akane  blushed for a moment, then glared at the chef, "Hey! Don't  insult Mako-chan!"</p><p>"Me?<i>  I </i>never called her a pervert."</p><p>Akane  looked down, ashamed, for a moment, and softly said, "I was  wrong."</p><p>Makoto  wrapped her arms around her girlfriend and gave her a little squeeze.   "It's ok, Akane. I forgave you a long time ago; what you've  done for me since then has more than made up for it."</p><p>Soun  smiled at the depth of emotion between his little girl and her ...  <i>signifciant other</i>. Then as Makoto's words echoed through his  head, his smile faded, slowly shifting into a frown, and then a  slavering maw as he entered full demon-head mode. "What have  you been doing to my baby!" he roared.</p><p>Makoto  gave a little shriek and cowered down, trembling and stammering,  "S-scary!"</p><p>Fortunately,  the demon was banished moments later by a forceful mallet blow to the  head and a battle cry of "Daddy! Stop picking on Mako-chan!"</p><p>Ranma  scratched the back of his head and remarked, "That looked  strangely familiar, somehow..."</p><p>Nabiki chuckled at the  scene and turned to Nodoka with a shark-like grin. "That doesn't  sound like a manly martial artist to me."</p><p>"On the contrary,"  The Saotome matriarch corrected. "It's very manly of my son to  pleasure his wife in every way shape and form… And make more  grandbabies, of course."</p><p>Nabiki as a rule didn't  blush often. Her profession demanded a poker face at all times. This  one time, however, it cracked as her playful barb at Ranma was turned  back on her. A quick peek into her mind might have even revealed a  little jealousy, because if there was one thing Nabiki was, it was  practical. She probably would have put his curse to good use too.</p><p>Ono Saotome held up his  hand. "More information than I need to know."</p><p>"Same here."  Ranko blanched.</p><p>"Pop ain't no  pervert." Akira glared at his Aunt Akane, and she smiled weakly  in return.</p><p>"Of course he  isn't." Akane managed, taking her own dates' hand… A tall,  long legged busty brunette. Ukyo was right. She really didn't have  any room to talk anymore. "We're all just surprised that he…"</p><p>"Adapted to the  curse so well?" Ranma finished, eliciting nods from the entire  family. "Let's just say I had some help." The sidelong  glance back to Setsuna didn't go unnoticed.</p><p>"Help?" Akane  wondered aloud.</p><p>"What sort of…  Help?" Ukyo continued, her mind conjuring up images of a green  haired whore seducing her best friend.</p><p>"You all know the  wish I made on that stupid sword, right?" More nods, and Ranma  continued. "Well, it wasn't nearly as stupid as we all thought.  I found out why I could never get a moment's peace and it was because  of her." Ranma jabbed a thumb back at Setsuna who smiled.</p><p>"You're wife?"</p><p>"Yep." Ranma  nodded. "About your time six months ago, she thought I was the  bane of human existence. She couldn't kill me so she set about  'occupying' my time."</p><p>"True love."  Nabiki quipped dryly. Ranma managed to ignore the comment.</p><p>"Well, the wish  told me all about her and her activities. Everything from  assassination attempts to arranging marriages for me." Ranma  explained, prompting an 'Oh my' from Kasumi. "That wasn't the  problem though. The problem was everything else the wish was doing."</p><p>"And what was it  doing, Son?" Nodoka inquired curiously.</p><p>"Stuffing my brain  with the life and times of the Princess of Pluto here." Ranma  took the aforementioned princess's hand gently, even as she frowned  at the recollection of events. "The wish basically downloaded  every memory she had into my brain over a period of six months."</p><p>Ukyo shrugged. "So  you know her really well. How bad can that be?"</p><p>"I'm over three  thousand years old." Setsuna stated flatly, cutting off any  further questions. "Normal human memory suffers from information  decay. Data drop-off. No way could I possibly recall what I was doing  238bc, but the magic Ranma invoked suffered no such restrictions."</p><p>"You were chatting  with Ptolemy the third." Ranma shrugged and the family looked at  him with disbelief. "Having the curse only made it worse. I was  going insane for a bit, thinking I was her at times."</p><p>"Then how…"</p><p>"Did I stay sane?"  Ranma asked rhetorically. "Well, my princess here helped out a  lot." Nobody missed the affection with which Ranma termed his  princess or the blush on her cheeks that followed "And we had  help from a Sailor Moon."</p><p>"<i>A </i>Sailor  Moon?" Kasumi picked up on the subtle twist of grammar in  reference to her heroine, and Setsuna fielded the answer.</p><p>"Our journey took  us to several worlds and across many realities." She explained  patiently. It was actually a well rehearsed speech, given how many  times they had both been through it. Even the kids were yawning.  "Many of those realities bear a close resemblance to this one."</p><p>"So you found <i>a  </i>Sailor Moon and healed Ranma." Nabiki pushed with no small  amount of skepticism. Of course, there was that image with her and  cursed sword floating around in her head…</p><p>"Yep." Ranma  took over. "Wasn't a complete success, but it was enough to  maintain my sanity… Not to mention my manhood."</p><p>"So what does that  have to do with your curse, Ranma-san?" Mako-chan asked politely  from behind Akane.</p><p>The pig tailed martial  artist paused before answering. "The lines blur a bit further."</p><p>"Sounds more like  mom." Ranko inserted, causing her brother and sister to nod in  agreement.</p><p>"So three thousand  years worth of memories plus your girl-type…" Ukyo theorized,  letting the answer drift off unfinished.</p><p>Ranma nodded. "I've  had plenty of time and opportunity over the last twenty years to  come to terms with that part of me. Hell, I don't even consider it a  curse any more."</p><p>"Obviously not."  Nabiki muttered to nobody in particular.</p><p>"Luckily, that's  all in the past." Soun stated agreeably. "You survived, got  married and returned with an honorable way to join-"</p><p>A black glow erupted  around Ranma and everybody, save his wife and kids took a step back  on reflex. A shadow aura rolled around the martial artist, turning  him into a black caldron of malcontent, offset only by his sparkling  blue eyes. The gold embroiled dragrons on black silk only served to  make the effect more surreal.</p><p>"I really, really  hope the next words out of your mouth weren't going to be <i>'join  the schools'</i>." The shadow Ranma growled with considerable  menace. "If you have a question about honor, you'll take it up  with me. <i>Not </i>my kids."</p><p>A pink flash of light  contrasted against the shadows and Ranma was joined by a transformed  Sailor Pluto at his side, who flipped the time key through an arc on  reflex. "And after my husband is done with you, I get <i>my</i>  turn."</p><p>Both father figures  stepped back once more. "B-but Son!"</p><p>"<i>If</i> Ono  wants the hand of a Tendo, he can court her like any other boy his  age." Ranma's glare burned into his father, who tried to shrink  against the far wall. "I won't have you suffocate <i>another</i>  relationship with your inane scheming." He let his stare burrow  into the pair a bit longer before the shadows faded away. He turned  to his mother in a considerably gentler tone. "No mistresses  either, Mom."</p><p>She waved the comment  aside with a smile. "Of course not. I'm more than satisfied with  your manly performance."</p><p>The blue eyes flicked  back to the awe stricken pair. "I've had twenty years to  perfect the art, and I guarantee you I'm a grandmaster in <i>every</i>  sense of the word. Set-chan here has more than enough power in her  little finger to reduce you to cinders. Do yourself a favor and <i>leave  it alone.</i>"</p><p>"Uh, right…"  Genma gulped nervously, his friend following suit with an excited  nod. Whatever the boy had been doing, his power was easily exceeding  that of the old master.</p><p>Setsuna studied the  sweating pair a moment longer and turned to her husband. "Think  they'll listen?"</p><p>"Not a chance."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Setsuna Saotome watched  as the dawn's light filtered across the Tendo dojo property and the  man dancing across it. She smiled as her husband flowed through  another kata at a fraction of the speed he was capable of producing.  Regardless, she knew that this particular exercise wasn't about speed  or power. It was about control and centering himself. Quieting the  wish borne memories. Kasumi Tendo stepped out into the cool morning  air and joined the Princess of Pluto to watch Ranma glide through his  practice. To Setsuna's surprise, the eldest sister dipped into a low  bow.<p>"Thank you for  bringing Ranma-kun back to us." Kasumi said in a low, reverent  voice. "We will always be grateful for that one thing… no  matter how some of us act."</p><p>"Really, it isn't  that-"</p><p>"No, it is."  Kasumi corrected softly. "Ranma was…<i> is </i>like my little  brother. Akane and Nabiki's as well, even if they won't admit it."  She looked over to the young man in black, who was now airborne  though a near impossible combination kick. "He really has gotten  quite good."</p><p>"He's the best."  Setsuna admitted with a soft smile. "It took me a few years to  realize that, but he really is."</p><p>"He's been  training you." Kasumi stated with certainty, and the green  haired princess looked up at her in question. "It's obvious in  the way you move."</p><p>Setsuna nodded. "And  the kids. He's a great teacher. It all seemed to come to the  forefront after he received his grand master's rating."</p><p>The pair of women  watched Ranma for another few minutes before he abruptly paused his  exercise, cocking his head curiously. It only took a minute for  Setsuna to realize why, as she reached out with her own abilities.  Kasumi looked at her curiously.</p><p>"Happosai."  She grunted. "Must have picked up the power spike Ranma blew off  last night." She smiled grimly. "Probably wondering who the  guest is."</p><p>"Oh my."  Kasumi gained a concerned look. "There won't me too much  property damage, will there?"</p><p>"Hah!"  Setsuna laughed. "He'll be lucky if he lasts five minutes  against my husband, let alone the time it would take to damage a  single blade of grass on your property."</p><p>Ranma sighed. "You  can stop hiding in the tree, Happosai-sensei."</p><p>On cue the tree top  rustled and the old master popped out, landing a mere three meters  away. "Ranma, m'boy! You continue to surprise me!" He eyed  the grown boy carefully. "Back from the dead and with a new  found respect for your elders to boot!"</p><p>"Good to see you  too, Master Happosai." Ranma bowed slightly and Kasumi was a bit  thrown by the display of respect.</p><p>"It'll become  obvious soon enough." Setsuna supplied, and Kasumi settled for a  nod.</p><p>"My, my, my!"  The old man smiled. "You might be trainable after all."</p><p>"If you have  anything to train me, I'll be more than willing to learn." The  martial artist smiled. Across the yard, Genma had frozen in the  doorway. Like his son, he was accustomed to getting up early and  practicing. What he was unaccustomed to was finding his newly  resurrected son squaring off against the Pervert Master.</p><p>"Excellent!"  The old gnome piped. "After we're done, you can tell me all  about how you returned from the dead. First order of business is for  you to try this on." Happosai pulled 'this' out, a lacy pink  bra. He tossed the offering to Ranma, who caught it easily. The young  man examined it and tossed it back.</p><p>"Think I'll pass."  Ranma shrugged and Happosai began to growl.</p><p>"I thought you  said you were ready to begin your training!"</p><p>Ranma blinked  innocently. "Not that I don't appreciate it, but it ain't my  type." Happosai blinked with surprise, a sentiment mirrored by  his father across the yard. "I'm more into the black stuff  personally. See-through and the like, you know?"</p><p>Even Kasumi had to  blink this time, and Setsuna smiled up at her. "And you think  he's kidding."</p><p>"Don't screw with  me, boy!" Happosai snapped and a palpable wave of power filled  the surrounding air. An angry blue glow surrounded the old master. "I  felt the spike last night! What have you been up to, Ranma?"</p><p>"A little of this,  a little of that." Ranma mused, incensing the pervert further.  Under normal circumstances, Genma would have intervened to save his  son from the massive can of whoop-ass his old master was about to  unleash, but today wasn't normal and neither was his son. If the old  pervert had seen Ranma's display last night, even he probably would  have thought twice in provoking the boy. But as it was…</p><p>"Kick his ass,  Boy!"</p><p>Ranma didn't even turn  around as Happosai stared over his shoulder in surprise anger. "I'll  deal with you later, Genma! Wear the bra or suffer my wrath, welp!"</p><p>Any trace of humor  faded away from Ranma's face. What remained was cold and dead. The  shadows flickered to life around the martial artist and spread over  him like an angry, light absorbing flame. Soon, the only thing  remaining was his blue eyes and the silken golden dragons.</p><p>"I'll take the  wrath."</p><p>Happosai stared. In  that moment, Ranma could have simply walked over and kicked his butt  into low orbit. He knew it, but couldn't help but to stare in shock  and awe. The boy was a goddamn reactor of power! The old master  couldn't even take a step back he was so enraptured with Ranma's  transformation. Even as he watched, air condensed around the martial  artist and the ambient temperature dropped. Droplets of moisture  spread along the grass around him and the shadow shifted from a  masculine form to one far more feminine in nature. Happosai took a  step back in dread. The boy had just manipulated the transformation  without any external aid! He condensed the air around him, for cryin'  out loud!</p><p>"Tell you what,  master Happosai. We'll do this in my weakest form." The female  shadow cracked her knuckles. "But if you've got something to  teach me, you'd best bust out with it now."</p><p>There was no warning  from the old pervert as he blurred in to open the enjgagement. He  couldn't afford a warning against that kind of power, and he took the  young heir hand to hand with his pipe. Ranma didn't even bother to  step into an attack stance, deflecting every single last one of  Happosai's high velocity strikes with ease. The master continued to  probe what was presumably the pig tailed girl beneath the shadows,  only to find an impenetrably wall of movement and deflections. The  master disengaged abruptly and pair of bombs were pulled from his  personal weapons space, fuses already crackling down. He tossed them  in toward the martial artist, who simply let them them bounce off her  chest and fall to the ground.</p><p><i>BOOOOoooMMM!</i></p><p>The explosion rocked  the neighborhood with a compression wave of sound and light, waking  everybody for miles. The combined Tendo and Saotome families were  instantly out of their beds, watching the smoke waft away from the  unharmed martial artist. While the Tendo's simply stared, Ranma's  brood hung their heads and yawned.</p><p>"Damn, it's just  Pop kicking Happi's butt again."</p><p>"I woke up for  <i>this?</i>"</p><p>"Auntie Kas-chan,  can you fix me breakfast?</p><p>The remaining family  members were treated to Ranma burning the gaping old man down with a  stare. There wasn't even a crater on the ground where Ranma was  standing, like he had somehow absorbed the entire blast. "Better  kick it up a notch, Sensei. I didn't even feel that."</p><p>A massive ki ball  formed in Happosai's hand and ripped out toward Ranma, who casually  defected it with an arm motion. The blue ball of energy arced skyward  and promptly exploded, momentarily blotting out the sun for a split  second. The martial artist frowned and took a step forward. The old  pervert took a step back. "Strike two. Tell you what, old man…  Promise not to ever show your face in Nerima again and I won't hurt  you too bad."</p><p>"I'll show you  true power, Boy!" Happosai proclaimed and his battle aura  erupted from around him, growing in size. "See if I don't crush  you!" The shadow Ranma simply shook her head and stepped up to  the growing silhouette and reached into it with a dark gauntlet. As  soon as her hand touched the barrier, the glowing blue aura halted  its expansion. Happosai's eyes widened even further and the aura he  was forcing power into began to shrink.</p><p>"Now, now. None of  that." The shadow admonished coldly as it siphoned away the old  man's power. The shadows around the Saotome seems to grow and  lengthen as the aura shrank.</p><p>The martial artist  seemed to teleport forward abruptly, blasting through what remained  of the perverted master's battle aura and imbedding a high powered  fist into his gut carrying him skyward. Happosai gained no more than  ten meters of altitude before the shadow disappeared again, appearing  above the gnome with an axe kick loaded for bear. The leg cracked  down into the master's body. He fell to the Earth hard and Ranma fell  with him, dark wisps of energy trailing behind her. Happosai fell  into the last meter, and the martial artist teleported one last time,  catching the gnome before impact. He hung dazed by one of Saotome's  hand while shadows snaked around the other, forming into an  insubstantial dark blade.</p><p>Happosai watched in  terror as the swirling point found the space between his eyes. "As  of this moment, your ties to the Saotome clan are officially <i>severed</i>.  You won't enjoy what'll happen to you if I <i>ever</i> see you again,  <i>Sensei</i>."</p><p>"Where… where  the hell did you learn all that!" Happosai gasped for breath  between coughs, occationally accompanied by blood. The shadows  dissipated from around Ranma, revealing a redhead far different than  he or any of the others remembered. She was a couple inches taller  and leaner. Her bust retained the same proportions, but were now  offset by a frame of more suitable proportions and height. All in  all, Ranma-chan had grown into a fine specimen of woman-hood.</p><p>"Simple." She  bit with contempt. "You're the one who proclaimed me grand  master, sensei."</p><p>"I… I never!"</p><p>"Well, not <i>you  </i>exactly," She amended with a tight smile. "Another, far  more honorable Happosai than yourself. And I've only gotten better  since then."</p><p>"Another… Me?"  He sputtered in disbelief as Ranma held him out at arm's length.</p><p>"From this point  on, neither my father nor the Tendos owe you anything." Ranma  explained in that cold tone. "Try to collect or step foot in  Nerima, and your ass is mine, understand?" Huge eyes nodded.  "Good."</p><p>From there, Ranma  hauled a foot back and gave Happosai the punt of all punts, a small  super sonic shockwave accompanying his journey to low earth orbit.  The martial artist watched the tiny point of light fad into the blue  sky and nodded with a smile as it disappeared entirely.</p><p>"Damn, I <i>do</i>  enjoy doing that."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Are you sure  they're going to be there?" The blonde odango poked her future  daughter on the shoulder, eliciting another nod.<p>"Of course I am."  She reassured Usagi, who was trailing behind her. "'Kira-kun  practically lives at the dojo." Chibi Usa added without regard  to temporal context, confusing the blonde further.</p><p>The pair rounded  another corner and walked along a wall to a pair of gates labeled  "Tendo School of Indiscriminate Grappling". Usagi Tsukino  reached for the bell that hung by wooden sign, only to watch Small  Lady push one of the gates open and walk in as if she owned the  place.</p><p>"Chibi, don't you  think we should…?"</p><p>"Nah." The  pink haired girl shook her head. "Besides, they already know  we're here." The questioning look was missed by the girl as they  walked across the yard, finding a pig-tailed boy with purple eyes  waiting at the house doorway. Usagi made the connection immediately.  Akira Saotome… Chibi's <i>boyfriend</i>.</p><p>The boy's face broke  into a smile on catching sight of the pair. "Hey Uus-chan!"  Usagi watched as Chibi calmly walked over with her own smile and  planted a kiss on Akira's face, prompting a blush from him. The  youngest Saotome recovered quickly, opening the door for the pink  haired girl. "You caught 'em just before the trip."</p><p>"The trip?"  Usagi asked as the stepped inside. Akira nodded.</p><p>"To China."</p><p>Any response the boy  might have had was instantly preempted as Chibi leapt past him toward  the two familiar faces Usagi knew all too well, though one and a half  would have been a more accurate number.</p><p>"Puu!" The  girl exclaimed and plowed into the sharply dressed Senshi of Time,  who accepted the bear hug easily. "It's good to see you alive  again!"</p><p>Setsuna smiled hugging  the girl. "Good to see you to, Small Lady. That was an excellent  performance, I might add."</p><p>Chibi glowed with the  compliment. "It was all I could do not to spill everything,  truthfully."</p><p>"Teasing me was a  bit over the top though." The redhead next to her, commented,  and the girl turn on her, glomping onto the other woman in turn.</p><p>"Uncle  Ranma-chan!" She gushed, squeezing the redheaded martial artist.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah."  Ranma rolled her eyes. "You're not getting off that easy."</p><p>Usagi simply starred.  She couldn't help it. "Just how much did you know!"</p><p>Chibi withdrew from  Ranma's embrace and put a finger to her mouth, making a big show of  her contemplation. "Um, everything!"</p><p>The blonde went face  first into the floor, but recovered quickly. "And you didn't  tell anybody!"</p><p>The pink haired  developed a frown. "It would have ruined things. I almost had to  tell Uncle-chan."</p><p>"Serves you  right." Ranma sniffed, then smiled at the two decade old  recollection of poking Chibi Usa toward the edge of an eight story  building ledge. Ah, those were the days.</p><p>"And you've  changed…" Usagi said, slowly making her way around what was  best known as Yumei Ikari's form. Instead of the teen she knew, a  woman every bit as exotic and beautiful as Setsuna stood before her.  "Chibi explained most of it, but…"</p><p>"But it's tough to  comprehend how much of a total and complete hottie I've become in six  short months, I know." Ranma stated with a sympathy that sounded  anything but genuine. Setsuna slapped her now female husband upside  the head, while Usagi nearly puked over the unabashed display of  vanity. ""Ow. Yeah, I look so good now, it hurts.  Literally..." she added, rubbing the back of her head. "Time  dilatation will do that to you."</p><p>"Time diahuh?"  Usagi parroted dumbly and Ranma smiled.</p><p>"A phenomenon  under which the <u>time  rate</u> of a remote or moving clock is different from  that of local clocks, usually due to near light speed travel or  temporal folding." Ranma explained conversationally, missing  Usagi's look or that of Nabiki, who had paused in the stairway. She  was looking down at her as if she had grown a second head.</p><p>"What, a new body  and brains to match, Saotome?" She quipped as she stepped down  to their level.</p><p>Ranma didn't even  acknowledge the barb and shrugged. "Already told you. Set-chan's  memories integrate better with my girl-type."</p><p>"And you don't  feel like changing back?"</p><p>Ranma shook her head.  "Not particularly. I've had twenty years to get used to  things. It's clothing more than anything else these days." She  paused, cocking her head. "That, and we have business to attend  to."</p><p>Nabiki's ears perked  up. "Business?"</p><p>"Amazon business."  Setsuna clarified, and Nabiki let out a silent "oooh." That  was a business venture she didn't want any particular part of. China  was as close as she wanted those people right about now.</p><p>Usagi looked at the  pair of women. "So when are you going?"</p><p>Ranma looked at  Setsuna, who shrugged. "No time like the present."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I challenge that  dainty one!" A blue haired woman called from the crowd,  prompting Setsuna and Ranma to look at one another.<p>"Are you  'dainty'?" Ranma blinked at his wife, who only managed to arch  an eyebrow.</p><p>"I thought she was  talking to you, hun." Setsuna replied, and both turned back to  the speaker, an over masculine woman with a short crop of blue hair  dressed in fine Chinese silks. Notable beyond her exceptional  masculinity was the fine scar running down one eye. She scowled at  the evident confusion.</p><p>"The green haired  one!" She clarified and Ranma shrugged. "Come forth and  face a true warrior!" Ranma rolled her eyes and stepped aside.  Setsuna stifled a chuckle and responded in fluent Chinese.</p><p>"No." The mob  of Amazons surrounding her rippled with anger and she let them stew a  second longer before continuing. "Do you seriously think I would  accept a challenge under such unfavorable conditions?"</p><p>"And what do you  consider 'favorable conditions'?" The Amazon hissed back.</p><p>"Oh, I dunno…"  Ranma rolled her eyes while caressing her long pigtail. "Maybe  an outcome that doesn't end in my wife being hunted to the ends of  the earth?"</p><p>The word 'wife' echoed  through the curious crowd of warriors and neither woman made any  effort explain themselves. Instead, Setsuna issued her own challenge.  "I invoke the Rite of Equals."</p><p>Silence pervaded the  Amazon mob of women and a grey haired elder, no more then three foot  tall, stepped forward. The blue robed elder stabbed her smooth wooden  cane into the earth and studied the foreigners carefully. "You  knowledge of Amazon law is impressive." The woman crackled, then  smiled grimly. "I would assume then you know what will happen  <i>when</i> you lose?"</p><p>"Slavery and death  are overrated." The Princess of Pluto returned, but the old  woman's smile persisted.</p><p>"And the young  ones behind you?" She looked over the Senshi's shoulder to Ono,  Ranko and Akira.</p><p>"Death." Ono  shrugged.</p><p>"Same here."  Ranko nodded with a smile.</p><p>"Mom's gonna kick  your butt." Akira stated matter-of-factly.</p><p>The elder couldn't help  but to admire the courage of the children… She eyed the two women.  Their children? If they could be taken alive, they would make  excellent stock for the tribe. But there was something she was  missing here. Two women and three children just don't stumble upon  the doorstep of the Joketsuzoku looking for a fight. That, and they  knew entirely too much about Amazonian law for comfort. Still, she  was a female and the Rite of Equals was her right…</p><p>"So be it. The  Rite of-"</p><p>"I have  conditions." Setsuna interrupted. "If I should win, the  rite would apply to my entire family. No challenges, no schemes to  integrate us into the tribe."</p><p>"Unless your  warriors are writing checks their asses can't cash." The  grinning redhead behind her added offhandedly, incensing the mob  further.</p><p>The old woman growled,  marring the ground with the end of her cane. She wasn't sure of the  complete meaning of the bothersome redhead's words, but it was almost  certain to be an insult. "I assure you that my sisters in arms  are quite capable of their victory over your <i>dainty</i> mate."</p><p>"I believe the  phrase is 'talk's cheap'." Setsuna replied, earning a razor  edged look from the old woman.</p><p>"Qiu Tiep! Step  forward!" The blue haired Amazon came through the crowd,  stopping next to the diminutive elder, who then turned to the crowd.  "This is the Rite of Equals, to the death as decided by the  victor. Should the newcomer prevail, tribal immunity shall be granted  to the entire family. If they lose, their lives are forfeit."  She paused and the crowd formed a circle around the combatants.  "Combat is hand to hand. Beyond this restriction, anything  goes."</p><p>"Anything goes?"  Ranko smiled.</p><p>"They're <i>so</i>  screwed." Ono grinned ferally.</p><p><i>"Begin!"</i></p><p>The Amazon didn't even  bother taking the time to size up her opponent and instead opted for  blitzkrieg-style tactics, rushing in at high speed in order to crash  through any defense the green haired woman might attempts. Setsuna  evade the initial flurry of punches and kicks with easy, keeping pace  with the furious Amazon as she switched styles on the fly.</p><p>"Over-extended  punch."</p><p>"Too soft."</p><p>"Good  combination."</p><p>"Sloppy foot  work."</p><p>"Don't leave your  guard down."</p><p>"Very nice."</p><p>"Missed opening."</p><p>Qiu Tiep's ire  continued to build through the woman's running commentary. Worse yet,  it was accurate. Nothing was penetrating the woman's defense and  anything that wasn't dodged outright was quickly and efficiently  deflected. Even with the deflections, the Amazon was getting the  distinct impression that the long haired woman was barely paying  attention to her efforts. Qiu Tiep was willing to settle for merely  breaking the woman, but now… now it was time to crush the life out  of her. The redhead would make a good servant. She disengaged,  switching stances into one favoring shiatsu pressure-point combat.  The woman simply stood there in an open stance, and this time, Qiu  Tiep wasn't fooled, and gathered her energies for a chestnut fist  burst of speed.</p><p>"I wouldn't do  that if I were you."</p><p>The Amazon shot forward  and the points of her fingers arced in on a graceful line. The woman  closed to blank range and initiated the blurring technique. "  Kachu Tenshin-!</p><p><i>Snap</i>.</p><p>"AAAiiiEEEHHeeE!"</p><p>The blue haired woman  disengaged abruptly, rolling right with the momentum and recovering  into a crouch, favoring her right hand. A quick examination revealed  the obvious- Every finger was broken, and she hadn't even seen the  bitch <i>move</i> to intercept the strike.</p><p>The Senshi of Time  gazed upon her opponent with sympathy. "Told you so."</p><p>The Amazon gritted  through the pain and anger fueled her resolve. She didn't want to  have to use such a high level technique on the woman so early, but it  was obvious this foreigner was holding back. With that thought in  mind, she dug deep into her ki stores and initiated the Soul of Ice.  This time was for real.</p><p>Back the dojo, Akane  Tendo sneezed.</p><p>Qiu Tiep launched  forward, reengaging Setsuna. Unlike before, however, she had no  intention of actually tangling with the newcomer. Instead, she  concentrated on drawing the green haired woman into a spiral, using  her hot ki as the catalyst to her doom. Punch. Kick. Kick.  Kick-punch. Punch. Step, step, step. It was perfect, she thought as  she fell into the pattern drilled into to her so many years ago. With  the power the newcomer was emanating now, she would be dead before  she cleared the treetops. Only a few more steps.</p><p><i>Now.</i></p><p>The blue haired Amazon  spun around, ready to step into the spiral's center, only to find a  pair of hard red eyes staring back at her. "What the-!"</p><p>"Seriously now.  That was one of the<i> first</i> techniques my husband taught me."</p><p>The classic right hook  ripped in at high speed, snapping the Amazon's head around with  ferocity. It was quickly accompanied by a sharp snap as the heel of  her foot found the Amazon's kneecap, displacing it painfully. Qiu  Tiep sank to the ground and Setsuna grabbed a flailing arm, pulled it  past her body and snapped it at the elbow. Her screams of pain were  interrupted only by the grunt that accompanied her face hitting the  dirt.</p><p>"Well that was  predictable." Ranma deadpanned, while Setsuna looked over her  twitching opponent.</p><p>The elder stood stunned  for a moment before entering the circle of battle, warily to inspect  her tribal sister. The girl wouldn't be getting up any time soon,  probably for weeks. If she walked normally again, it'd be a miracle.  Qiu Tiep was one of the best warriors in the tribe, and she had gone  down far to easily. It could only mean one thing… The Joketsuzoku  had just been sandbagged.</p><p>"Well?"</p><p>The tribal elder looked  up at the red eyed woman and snarled. "I consider the Rite null  and void! The Joketsuzoku do not take kindly to being tricked."</p><p>Setsuna frowned. "And  just who tricked you?"</p><p>"You and your  brood!" She snapped back. "You are fortunate we don't  simply eliminate you outright for maiming one of our own."</p><p>"It's not our  fault you entered into an official challenge against somebody not  only better than you, but smarter as well." Ranma shook his head  in exaggerated disappointment and looked over her shoulder. "What's  the first rule of battle, 'Kira?"</p><p>"Know your  opponent, Pop!"</p><p>Ranma shrugged, turning  back to the elder. "See? Even my thirteen year old son knows  that. What's your excuse?"</p><p>"I will not suffer  your impertinence, witch!" She brought the staff up to challenge  Ranma and Setsuna, while her maidens fell into flanking positions  around her. "You should feel fortunate that we'll only kill you  and your harlot, green one. Your children will make excellent  additions to the tribe."</p><p>"Fat chance."  Ono Saotome replied, lighting off a bright blue aura of power.</p><p>"Don't think so."  Ranko Saotome agreed, and erupted into a golden glow.</p><p>"Told ya we'd kick  your butts." Akira Saotome cracked his knuckles as a purple aura  swirled around him.</p><p>Black shadow engulfed  Ranma Saotome and his wife flashed pink, processing the  transformation into her fuku armor. The family collected into a tight  group and it was all the Elder could do to hold her ground against  the massive wave of power blasting across her like the winds of the  Sahara. She tore her eyes off the collective group to focus on the  green hair woman staring down on her with lethal intent.</p><p>"Who… <i>just  who the hell are you!</i>"</p><p>Setsuna Saotome dropped  into a slight curtsy. "I'm Sailor Pluto, Guardian of Time, at  your service." The elder hissed, taking a reflexive step back.  The demoness that had plagued their tribe for the last thousand years  had returned! Still, she had to know the whole truth. "And you?"</p><p>"Ranma Saotome,  Grand Master of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts." The  Old woman could barely contain her horror as the redhead jabbed a  thumb at a distant mountain range. "You know… fought the  winged guy over there on the mountain? You may have heard of me."</p><p>"No… you…<i>you're  dead!</i>"</p><p>"Let me show you  my references." The shadowy redhead reached into weapons space  and pulled the individual staves, the Gekkaja and Kinjakan from  storage. The armed crowd around them back up another step at the  sight of Saffron's keys of ascension. The woman then condensed the  moist air around her with cold ki and flash heated it, activating the  curse. A now male Ranma twirled the staves around, demonstrating the  lethal precision with which he could wield them. "Any more  questions?"</p><p>The Elder gawked. It  was all she could do. Literally. It no longer matter how good her and  her sisters were. The kids alone could probably wipe out her front  lines given the power they were radiating, let alone the parents.  They… They could annihilate the entire village without breaking a  sweat, she suspected, and there was only one course available to her  besides a suicidal attempt on their lives.</p><p>"What… What are  your demands?" She gulped nervously, lowering her eyes to the  ground as though she was not worthy to look upon them. She wasn't.  She knew it. The remaining Amazons followed suit.</p><p>"That's better."  Setsuna smiled pleasantly. It was the sort of smile alligators gave  small animals that wandered too close to the waters edge. "Your  show, honey."</p><p>Setsuna stepped aside  and the shadows slowly dissipated from around Ranma. His blue eyes  scrutinized every inch of the elder and she shifted uncomfortably  under his gaze. "What is your name?"</p><p>"Du Shu,  Saotome…sama." Ranma simply nodded as if the honorific was  expected.</p><p>"You're the Elder  of this tribe's council?" He probed, and she nodded an  affirmative.</p><p>"Not any more."  The old woman blinked. "I didn't come all the way out to China  to play hide and go seek, Cologne-sensei. Come on out."</p><p>Du Shu's eyes widened  and she snarled. "That woman is a failure! She has no rights-!"</p><p>The death that danced  in Ranma's blue eyes stopped her cold. "And why is that?"</p><p>It was only then that  the old woman realized just what an epic corner she had painted  herself and the tribe into. Du Shu's next words were whispered with  trepidation. "She failed to return with you…"</p><p>"Mm hmm."  Ranma nodded as a staff-bound Cologne hopped up to the family,  Shampoo in tow. The martial artist frowned. While they had obviously  endured their fall from grace with honor, their external appearance  spoke volumes. Cologne even looked slightly older and the world had  obviously forced Shampoo to grow up just a little faster. A certain  spark was gone from both their eyes. He turned back to the deposed  elder, displeasure evident on his face. "Looks like her mission  was a success after all."</p><p>Du Shu knew she was on  perilous ground now, but was determined not to go down without a  fight. "Oh? I seriously doubt you'll cast aside your mate for an  Amazon wife. In that, Cologne has still failed."</p><p>The green robed woman  balanced evenly on her cane chuckled softly. Du Shu turned to find a  mischievous smile inhabiting her predecessor's lips. "Well  played, great grandson. Well played."</p><p>"<i>What</i> was  well played?" The ex-Elder growled looking from Ranma to Cologne  and back. She didn't appreciate being the bunt of joke.</p><p>"Only that <i>you've</i>  taken care of<i> that</i> quite handily." Ranma pointed out with  his own mischievous grin. "I believe when my wife won, she also  won tribal immunity for the entire Saotome clan thanks to you. <i>Me  included</i>."</p><p>"What? I…! No!  That isn't…!"</p><p>"Not only that,"  He pressed. "I believe it was you who broke your honor bound  pledge to hold up that agreement."</p><p>"But…!"</p><p>"Not to mention  being so criminally negligent as to pit your one of your sisters up  against an opponent she couldn't possibly prevail against."  Setsuna added, and Du Shu's face drained of color. "With leaders  like you, your tribe really doesn't need enemies like <i>us</i>."</p><p>"Make yourself  scarce, witch." Ranma glared into the failed leader, who seemed  to shrink into her own body.</p><p>"As… as you  wish, Ranma-sama." With that, the woman shuffled away, leaving  the Saotome family, Cologne and Shampoo in the center of the crowd.</p><p>"I am… Impressed  is a vast understatement, Saotome-san." Cologne admitted,  scrutinizing a Ranma several years older than she remembered.</p><p>Ranma waved the  compliment aside as Shampoo inspected him as well. It was amazing  enough that she refrained from glomping him outright. "Grandson  is fine by me." He admitted, his attitude softening  considerably.</p><p>"It is really you,  Aire- Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma nodded, and  proceed to introduce his family and Cologne arched an eyebrow as they  all referred to her as 'grandmother' quite comfortably "Tell ya  about it later." was the martial artist's only explanation.  Cologne nodded soberly. Ranma was married to the tribe's nemesis,  older and had three kids. She would be damn certain he would tell her  later.</p><p>Interesting times,  indeed.</p><p>"Shampoo darling!"  The white-robbed boy came tumbling out of a nearby shack and past the  entire family, stooping next to a barrel. "I thought you had  gone off and-"</p><p>"MOUSSE-HONEY!"</p><p>The raven haired boy  didn't even have time to don his glasses before being line tackled by  a green haired pigtailed girl. "Ooooh! I missed you so much!"</p><p>Mousse struggled to  free himself as the unknown girl pinned him to the ground, showering  him with kisses. "Who… Who the hell are you? I don't even  know you!"</p><p>Ranko Saotome paused in  her ministrations, looking at the boy curiously. "You don't  know, do you?" Mousse shook his head wildly no. "Oh darn.  Looks like I'll just have to retrain you all over again."</p><p>The struggle resumed  and Cologne nearly fell off her stick at the sight. She turned to  Ranma, who was simply shaking his head. "I honestly don't know  what she sees in that boy."</p><p>"Hush, honey."  Setsuna poked him. "Don't you know, its love?"</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes  and Cologne could only twitch.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma and Setsuna  Saotome watched the last rays of afternoon light stream through the  bamboo poles of Jusenkyo, its light refracting off the cursed pool in  a natural display of beauty, as the sun sank into mist covered  Bayankara Mountains. The Princess of Pluto snuggled in close and  Ranma's arm fell around her waist.<p>"Brings back the  memories, y'know?" The Grand Master mused, picking out one  particular bamboo pole from the rest.</p><p>"Not all of them  bad, I hope."</p><p>Ranma looked over to  find Setsuna's mischievous smile playing across her lips. "One  of these days I'll find that stash of instant boy Nannichuan of  yours."</p><p>"And then what?"  The Princess challenged playfully and Ranma made a show of  concentrating on the dilemma.</p><p>"Nevermind that."</p><p>"Thought so."  She snorted and returned to the view.</p><p>"No, not all of  them bad." Ranma returned to the original question. "Not  bad at all." He lingered over the memories a bit longer then  turned back to his wife. "Ono is gonna have his hands full,  though."</p><p>Setsuna frowned. "I  thought he was immune the kiss protocols."</p><p>"He is,"  Ranma replied. "That's not stopping all the girls from fighting  <i>each other</i> for a chance to date him, however."</p><p>"Oh God." His  wife simply shook her head at the mental image. "Any front  runners?"</p><p>"Shampoo, of  course." Ranma smiled wickedly while Setsuna rolled her eyes at  the news, but couldn't help but to chuckle. They both lapsed into a  moment of amused contemplation as the sun sat, before Ranma broke it  once more.</p><p>"So what are you  going to tell Usagi? She's gonna ask sooner or later."</p><p>"About Crystal  Tokyo?" Ranma nodded. Setsuna shrugged. "I'll just tell her  it's no longer attainable and we'll have to find another solution."</p><p>Ranma nodded  thoughtfully, then smiled. "So you're going to lie to her."</p><p>"Not at all."  Setsuna corrected with mirth. "Without my help, it <i>isn't</i>  attainable. The best course of action isn't always <i>right </i>course  of action. You helped me see that." Ranma nodded once more and  remained silent.</p><p>"So you're gonna  lie to her."</p><p>Setsuna smiled. "Let's  just say what she doesn't know, won't hurt her."</p><p><i><b>End.</b></i></p><p><i><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/></b></i></p><p><u><b>Author's notes;</b></u></p><p>I had a good deal of  writer's block on this story, namely in bringing all the elements  together. When I get writer's block, I move on to other stories, Heir  to the Empire being a primary result of that :p For those wondering,  this is the "original" ending I've had since day one, with  X2 being an alternate timeline.</p><p>See series ANs for  further details.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Corrections; Ranma's trip originally lasted 18 years. I cite Ono as being 18 years old. This creates a situation where Ranmaevidentally hopes in the sake rather quickly. Ono's age adjsuted to 17, trip adjusted to twenty years and Ranma's real age to 38.<br/>
