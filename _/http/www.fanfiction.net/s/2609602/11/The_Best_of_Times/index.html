</div><p><b>End Series Notes</b><br/>Roll closing credits to  <i>Baba O'Riley</i> – The Who</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i><b>T</b>he Best of  Times originally started out as two aborted attempts at fukufic's  original request. With these, I never got more than a few pages in  before realizing just how derivative they were, especially after I  started checking out the Ranma-Sm Xover scene in depth. First we  started out with Standard Fuku Plot #2: Ranma loses memory, fights  for love, justice and angst. Second came SFP #6: Ranma meets Setsuna,  falls for time bitch therapy session.</i><p><i>See? The originality  was just pouring from them.</i></p><p><i>So we tabled them  both and went for the prank war, which I'm proud to say you've  all made wildly successful. Thank you for the 75K+ ffnet hit traffic,  650+ reviews, 20 c2s, 193 alerts, 203 favs and crashing my homepage  by exceeding its 5gb traffic limit. You people rock.</i></p><p><i><b>I</b>t should  also be noted that I couldn't have done this without a lot of  support, or at least not nearly as well. While there are too many  people to name, just pop into Fukufics irc. Those people are the  series credits right there. Prior to this fic, my knowledge of Sailor  Moon was absolutely zero. I am not exaggerating. Without the cast of  fukufics (dotcom), this story would have been harder to write and  several magnitudes less enjoyable. </i></p><p><i>And since you all  rock so much, we're going out with a bang. Outlined below are the  first two aborted attempts at this work, along with a preview of Ah  My Ranma ½, which I'll be hitting hard now that this is out  of the way. They're raw and unedited, but here it is.</i></p><p><i>Enjoy.</i></p><p><i>Disclaimer- This  stuff is rough and incomplete for obvious reasons.<hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p><b>End  All Be All</b><br/>By:  Ozzallos<br/><i>Aborted  Fukufic Attempt, take one.</i></p><b>Stage 01</b><p>It was The Plan. The  Perfect Plan. The Plan to End All Plans. Shampoo rolled the red  capsules around between her fingers with a devious smile. Granted, it  had taken a severe stomping of Pink and Link to gain their secrets,  but the deed was done and the only thing that remained was its  execution. She stared at her newly acquired implements of change.  Contained therein was a soporific that when inhaled would dissolve  the bonds of friendship within a person's very brain. Not simply  dissolve, but annihilate. It would break down those tentative links  in the mind, leaving nearly everything else intact. Sure there would  be some side effects Shampoo realized, but they were now considered  negligible compared to the gains. Among them were dry mouth, nausea  and headaches… Oh, and the acute loss of minor details such as ones  own name, birthplace and other minutia. For her immediate plan of  action, it meant that Ranma would most likely forget her and possibly  even his own name, but it was an acceptable risk when balanced with  the potential gain of having a completely unbiased Ranma to shape and  mold as her friend and eventual lover.</p><p>She counted the  capsules again. Eight. There was a reason she had made the extras and  it was because poisoning Ranma alone would be an exercise in  futility. She was going to saturate the entire Tendo compound with  the airborne agent in order to ensure nobody remembered or came  looking for him after they had gone back to China. First the Tendos  then that silly spatula girl. It was a much more elegant solution  than Plan B. After all, the amount of bloodletting Plan B involved  would undoubtedly attract the kind of attention that she and great  grandmother were looking to avoid. Fun? Most definitely. Efficient?  Sadly, no. Shampoo rolled the capsules around between her fingers  once more before dropping them into a silk pouch.</p><p>It was time to kick ass  and take memories.</p><p>By any measure it had  been a good day for Ranma Saotome, heir to the Anything Goes School  of Martial Arts. Which is to say it had actually been a very <i>bad</i>  one. He had come to realize early on that any good day for him meant  that there was a woeful imbalance of karma in the universe and that  sooner or later his person would be used as the conduit to bring into  balance in a most unpleasant manner. Akane was happy today, which was  a bad sign. She had even been humming on their way to school, which  by Ranma's standard was the herald to the four horsemen of the  apocalypse. He had not been splashed once by cold water, which  probably meant the seas would be overflowing with blood soon enough  and Nabiki even gave him a pass today. Ranma was certain if he looked  up into the sky he would not only find a total eclipse of the sun,  but a burning two hundred mile wide meteor poised to smite all of  mankind for its trespasses. Or maybe it was just all in his head.  After all, it's only paranoia if nobody is out to get you.</p><p>He was almost relieved to find out  Akane was cooking since Kasumi was on a date with Doc Tofu. Ranma  would take his punishment like a man and karma would be brought back  into alignment for nothing more than a stomachache and a week's  worth of indigestion. It was a fair compromise in his opinion. Better  him take the karma bullet than watch as all of civilization collapsed  around him simply because he couldn't take Akane's cooking. Of  course, sometimes it fought back harder than Ryoga, but then the life  of a martial artist is fraught with peril, right?</p><p>A smiling Akane sat the  dish down in front of him and Ranma knew he was in trouble. She had  mentioned that she was making chow mein and what was on the plate  actually <i>looked </i>like chow mein. His sense of dread grew  exponentially at the realization that she had actually cooked  something that bore a superficial resemblance to its namesake. All  eyes were on him of course, being the official Tendo sacrificial  lamb. He was their canary in the coalmine, because if he keeled over  the food was toxic and not to be touched under any circumstances by  the rest of the family. In fact, his fits of agony would probably  provide them with the perfect distraction in order to escape the evil  daughter's culinary masochism. Ranma steeled himself and took the  first bite of noodles. His life flashed before his eyes and he knew  it with certainty…</p><p><i>They were all gonna  die</i>.</p><p>It would be a sick and  painful death, undoubtedly riddled with screaming torture and  anguish. It would be suffering on a magnitude never before seen,  unimaginable in its scope. And just how did Ranma Saotome know such a  hideous fate awaited him? Quite easily, actually.</p><p>The food was <i>good</i>.</p><p><i>AN- This scene was  so good that I just had to reuse it in tBoT pt.2</i></p><p><i>CRUuuNCH!</i></p><p>The wall caved easily  and a purple haired SS shock trooper stepped through the improvised  doorway and into the Tendo living room. It was almost a hilarious  sight for them if it hadn't happened so suddenly and destructively.  She was clad in her standard lavender silk attire with rich purple  locks hanging around… A gas mask? The device was of World War Two  vintage and its rubber and hosed molding contrast sharply with her  usual dressed to kill ensemble. One hand held a single festively  colored bonbori while the other a silk pouch.</p><p>The day's pressure  coiled and snapped inside Ranma with instantly realization- Karma  had come home to roost. His body went to high alert and adrenaline  poured wholesale through his body in response to the new threat.  Normally Shampoo by herself wouldn't have warranted the DEFCON one  reaction, but today had been a <i>good</i> day and he somehow had  identified the Amazon as the catalyst that would lead to the end of  the world as he knew it. Ki discharged into his system and his battle  aura snapped to life. Ranma was off the table and sliding into a  combat stance before even being consciously aware of the fact. All of  this happened within seconds and it gave Shampoo reason to pause. Did  he know! She was less than a minute into the operation and it was  already in jeopardy!</p><p>For his part, Ranma  Saotome had no idea, but there was one thing he did know and it was  that the karma sledge hammer was on its downward stroke. For  everything else Ranma was, he was a genius. It didn't show in his  grades. Or his social skills. But it did in battle and the tactical  computer that was his brain snapped into place, immediately  identifying the silk pouch as the greatest threat in the room. There  was a reason the Amazon had forced an entry, just like there was a  reason she sacrificed offensive power in favor of the pouch. There  was no way of knowing what it contained, but it was important to drop  a single bonbori from her normal pair <i>and</i> don a freakin'  gasmask. A small part of Ranma couldn't help but to noted the  irony. He had been expecting the biological warfare threat from  Akane's cooking tonight.</p><p>No turning back, Shampoo thought as she  steeled herself for the engagement. All she did was have to get one  solid hit and the cloud of spores would take care of the rest. Her  fingers dug into pouch and drew the first red capsule. Her thumb  flipped the capsule and it streaked into Ranma at high speed who  realized two things at once—First, a gas mask meant an airborne  threat. Second, the family was still at his back and vulnerable.  Ranma took a quick step back and kicked the dinner table vertical  with the back of his heel while hardening the battle aura around him.  The red capsule scored a direct hit, but detonated off the aura  instead of his body. A clouds of pink smoke erupted around him and  Ranma flashed the aura, vaporizing the atmosphere in his immediate  vicinity. The upturned table took the brunt of the flash and scorched  the lamination, but kept the family safe.</p><p>"Shampoo, you don't-</p><p>"Shampoo have Airen, nobody else!"  She declared and launched three more capsules simultaneously, each  rebounding off his aura, bursting and flash vaporized within seconds.  The Amazon scowled. Four more left and her odds of success were  dropping with each one spent. Direct strikes against her Airen were  out of the question, she realized. He would just keep vaporizing the  clouds before they had a chance to infect anybody and she would lose.  Not only would she lose, but they would remember who had made the  hole in their wall and send the bill to the Neko Han Ten. Maybe even  make her pay for the charred table that the rest of the family was  hiding behind now. Not good. She would have to hope for proximity  strikes then. She'd rather have direct impacts, but her last four  capsules should saturate the room with enough spores to do the job  against everybody at once. Shampoo's thumb flipped out again and  the last four capsules shot out, each aimed at a different part of  the room.</p><p>She didn't have a chance. Maybe if  Ranma had been unprepared or otherwise distracted, the tactic would  have worked. Today wasn't that day, if only because he had been  expecting karmatic justice to rain from the sky to crush him at any  moment. Ki fuel his next movements and his hands flew out at Chestnut  Fist speeds to intercept the projectiles. None of the four capsules  found their marks as they were snatched out of the air by Ranma's  hands and buffered by his aura to prevent their detonation. Ranma  took a moment to examine his red capsules before giving Shampoo a  long look.</p><p>"Don't suppose you want to explain  these, huh?"</p><p>Shampoo let the bambori fall to the  ground in equal parts amazement and disgust. Her mask came off as  well. The perfect plan had failed! How? How had he know? She fell  to her knees and began to sob. There were few things that could have  cracked Ranma's armor at that point. His body was ki fortified. His  reflexes were lightening enhanced. He had the offensive firepower of  a battalion of tanks. But one thing he didn't have was the stomach  to watch a girl suffer a total mental breakdown in front of him,  especially one he considered a friend. …Well, most of the time, at  least.</p><p>"Aw, come on! Don't do that!"  Ranma complained and walked over to tearful Amazon. Besides, it  wasn't as if she was a threat any longer. If the karmatic  sledgehammer was still out there, it wouldn't be coming from  Shampoo.</p><p>"WHAT ARE DOING!" Akane raged,  popping her head up from behind the charred table. She stood up and  stomped over to Ranma. "She almost killed us!"</p><p>"Look, Akane—"</p><p>"Don't 'look Akane' me!" She  yelled, her rage building in fine form. "She just tried to  assassinate me and here you are playing kiss and make-up!" Ranma's  eyes widened as she pulled a familiar shape from behind her back.</p><p>"Can you give it a rest for once,  Tomboy!" Ranma gasped. He had too much stress, adrenalin and  crisis to deal with for one day to even think about checking the more  inflammatory words in his vocabulary.</p><p>"BAKA PERVERT!"</p><p><i>WHAaaM!</i></p><p>With a mighty swing of her mallet- the  very instrument of the Universe's karmatic justice – Ranma was  'go' for liftoff.</p><p><b>Stage  02</b></p><p>Ranma Saotome, heir to the Anything  Goes School of Martial Arts found his ballistic arc across the Tokyo  skyline rudely interrupted by the ground as he proceeded to turn a  nice fifteen-foot patch of grassy park into cratered rubble. The  sudden plume of dirt and rock had been expected as he braced for  impact, maxing out his ki buffering abilities for the sudden stop.  What hadn't been expected was the pink fog that erupted with the  plume and Ranma choked on both as he struggled to come to his senses.  He climbed out of his six-foot deep crater hacking and spitting dirt  while a wave of nausea rippled through his body.</p><p>Damn, she musta hit me harder than I  thought, Ranma thought, finally stepping out on to undisturbed park  grass. Wait… She? He struggled to put a name to the memory fragment  without success. Another wave of nausea dizzied him. 'She' was  how I got here… But how…? Ranma found himself staring at his  hands for some reason, watching pieces of four red capsule shells  drift away with the evening breeze. That should mean something to me,  he thought. How had he gotten here again? A few drops of rain began  to patter her and there as he brooded over his fate.</p><p>A scream pierced the evening air  followed by an unnatural howl. Suddenly the memories took a back seat  to the here and now as Ranma's pushed his aura back up through the  exaustion. God, I'm tired… A crash echoed across the park and he  fought off the darkeness that tried to claim him. He had stumbled to  a sidewalk and saw it… The 'It' in question had a slimy pinkish  skin and looked vaguely humanoid; Almost like a human female if one  were feeling generous with the descriptive. Its arms ended in long  foot long razor fingertips and it was using them with startling  efficiency, cutting down victims left and right. Another scream cried  out but this one was much younger than the others. She couldn't  have been more than eight years old. Blackness threatened to claim  Ranma again as he watched the pink un-woman lock on to the girl  cowering in the park bushes. The beast lumbered over to her and it  triggered the one thing Ranma Saotome could remember even as his  memories faded from the world—The first duty of a martial artist  was to protect those unable to protect themselves.</p><p>The price was non-negotiable.</p><p>"<i>Kijin  Raishü Dan !"</i></p><p>The  beast suddenly found its groping arm cleaved into a stump as two  vacuum blades sliced through the pink appendage that sought out the  terrified girl. It wasn't so much pain than shock that cause the  female parody to turn away from its intended victim and over to the  newcomer. The youma's primitive brain comprehended only two things  as it assessed the new threat. First, it was dangerous and thus a  priority. Second, it had exactly what the master required. The  creature began its stumbling charge and was greeted by a Moko  Takabisha , pink bits of flesh burning away from its demonic frame.  It staggered, but continued to advance…</p><p>Ranma  dodge the remaining arm and went hand to hand. Even if his reaction  times left something to be desired, he was moving on instinct alone  and it kept him one step ahead of the aggressor as he opened up its  guard and unleashed a pulverizing combo into the youma's torso. He  could feel the hate roil from its being and something clicked. It  wasn't heated ki, but it was close enough to satisfy The Dragon.  Ranma took a step back to set up the spiral and was treated to  another crushing wave of nausea while more of his brain shut down.  His guard faltered and the remaining claw plowed in, snapping around  his head like a vice. Ranma could feel it sucking down the ki through  a link the monster had established. He had once chance. The martial  artist activated the Soul of Ice and concentrated the technique into  his fist with his last remaining seconds.</p><p>"<i>Hiryu   Hyu-Toppa !"</i></p><p>The  whirlwind unleashed.</p><p>Then  darkness.</p><p>Cold.</p><p>A sliver of awareness penetrated the  darkness as it registered the light concussive patter of rain on the  body it was only now dimly aware of. More strands of awareness joined  the first more and more complex information began to circulate, such  as pain. Pain in every muscle and every bone. A throbbing pain in her  head and another in her chest. She cracked an eye open, only to have  a droplet run down into it, causing her to blink furiously. She  tested her muscles and joints on reflex and was rewarded with pain.  Yes it was painful, but everything appeared to be working. Why would  she be in pain? She forced both eyes open this time, noticing her  view of the world consisting of grass and dirt. A shiver ran down her  spine and her limbs wearily obeyed her bidding, propping her up off  the cold, wet earth. The blur that was her vision began to clear and  she tried to take stock of the situation, even as a migraine racked  her brain.</p><p>Okay, so it's a park, she thought and  scanned her surroundings. Well it feels familiar, but what am I doing  here? She plumbed the depths of her brain for the information and  found it sorely lacking in its ability to cooperate. The questions  beginning with Who, Where and Why also came up empty, and it wasn't  long before she began to expand that list of just how much she <i>didn't</i>  know. For instance, she knew she was a consummate martial artist but  had no idea of who trained her or where that training took place. She  could cook. Liked to cook even. Who she actually cooked for was a bit  beyond her grasp at the moment. Where was she born? No idea.</p><p>My memory is Swiss  cheese and all I got to show for it is this massive headache, she  complained internally. Hell, I don't even know what my name is.  Somehow it was more annoying than anything else and she pushed  herself off the wet grass and to her feet. That was when she saw the  corpses and the disintegrated remains of the pink youma. I had  something to do with that, she realized somewhat calmly. From her  view it was obvious that the attack had not only ripped clean through  the monster, but a semi truck and the trees beyond, leaving a carved  circular pathway through them.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>ANs- <i>Rejected. I  thought by combining so many well use plot concepts together I'd be  able to create an original, chaotic read. I'm sure it would have  been a good read in retrospect, but not a great one, let alone gain  tBoTs stature. The mood is also considerably darker for this fic,  which was intentional. I normally do comedies and was purposely  aiming for a higher degree of angst this time around. Alas, I already  have another fic to fill that role handily.<hr noshade="" size="1"/></i><p>So next we came up  with….</p><p><b>Just Droppin' In</b><br/>By  Ozzallos<br/><i>Aborted  Fukufic Attempt, take two.</i></p><b><u>Ichi</u></b><p>"<i>ARE  YOU SAYING MY COOKING SUCKS!"</i></p><p>Akane  was in total meltdown mode now, her favorite hobby having been  slighted by yet another poor choice of words on the part of her  fiancé. She took a menacing step forward, soupspoon in hand.  Why she was wielding a soupspoon at the moment was beyond the  comprehension of her current audience since there was nothing  spoonable about their meal. That, and they were pretty sure it was  burning a hole in their plates, though nobody had been brave enough  to point out the fact… Well, nobody but Ranma, God rest his soul.  They'd hold his funeral later. After they escaped the evil clutches  of one Akane Tendo. Maybe.</p><p>"Calm  down, Akane! I didn't say it sucks!" Ranma protested, taking a  step back. No, it rates much worse than suckage, he thought. His  fiancées face suddenly bright red and an angry crimson aura  began to flicker around her. Ranma looked over to the rest of the  family who all wore masks of abject horror now. He looked back at  Akane and small nuclear reactions were flaring in her eyes.  Realization finally hit him.</p><p>"I  just said that last part aloud, didn't I?"</p><p>The  rest of the family nodded once in unison. The soupspoon snapped in  Akane's hand and the other began to pull something out from behind  her back. This time it wasn't a mallet, but an honest to God  Dwarven War Hammer. Ranma sighed in resignation. Yep, time to take my  medicine. He leaned forward with his left cheek and she swung for the  fences.</p><p>"<i><b>RANMA  NO BAKAAAA !"</b></i></p><b><u>Ni</u></b><p><i>30mph.</i></p><p>Ranma  accelerate sharply through the roof's newest hole and out into open  air with a painful crack. Even as he gained altitude, rain drops  began to sting against the martial artist's face and seconds later  activated his curse. The world was blurring by as the chiseled  pigtail boy became a shapely pigtail girl who absently wondered where  she would land this time.</p><p><i>53  mph.</i></p><p>Damn  she put a lot of power to that last hit, Ranma mused as more rain  streaked by. And where the hell had she gotten that hammer! Don't  you need a license for those things or something? She stabilized her  uncontrolled tumble with a little influence of ki and absently noted  that he was quickly approaching the overcast ceiling. Nothing to  worry about there, she thought. The arc should be flattening out any  time now.</p><p><i>71  mph.</i></p><p>Contrails  begin to streak off the redhead and she marveled. Akane will be happy  to hear that she's setting a new distance malleting record. Hell,  I'm clearing the Nermia suburbs right now, Ranma thought darkly.  One thing was for certain though… It was going to be a long walk  home.</p><p><i>88  mph.</i></p><p>Ranma  felt a tingle along her spine as the ballistic arc began to flatten  out. Give me a few more seconds and I'll be able to predict my  landing zone, she thought, failing to notice her hair beginning to  stand on end. May take two days to get back at this—</p><p>ZAP!  <b><i>CRAaaACK!</i></b></p><p>Some  people would argue that Ranma Saotome, heir to the Anything Goes  School of Martial Arts was a lucky guy. After all, what manly man  wouldn't want three to twenty fiancées throwing themselves  at your feet at any given moment or jump your bones if you so much as  look at them wrong? These people, of course failed to notice the  details and the devil therein. Drugged food. Rivals. Kidnappings.  Extortion. Villains of the Week. Malletings. And of course the  lightening bolt that Ranma had just flown into.</p><p>1.21  gigawatts of power blasted through the martial artist's body and  light flared around him. A loud yip was heard as the bolt interacted  with his unusually high levels of ki, which promptly vaporized him in  a tempest of chaotic energy. By the time the lightening had spent  itself there was nothing was left of Ranma but two flaming shoes  falling from the sky.</p><p>Sailor  Pluto stared at the Gates of Time and affected a labored sigh. It was  one of those days, days where she felt as if her all-important  station in life was nothing more than that of a glorified data entry  clerk. Get up, check the time gates, maximize the probabilities, make  some tweaks and go home. It wouldn't be so bad if the job were nine  to five, but sometimes her 'shift' would stretch for decades on  end as she plotted the surest path to Crystal Tokyo. Of course she  had some conveniences in her own private section of hell, but there  was one thing she could never escape and it dug into her soul.</p><p>Loneliness.</p><p>Loneliness  that was staggering in its magnitude.</p><p>The  woman with flowing green hair used the gate key that was her staff  and exerted control, switching to another possible reality. All  things considered, it was actually a good day for Sailor Pluto. She  was at a ninety-five percent probability for Crystal Tokyo's  existence and all was quiet on the western front. No Generals. No  youma. No daimons stealing crystal hearts. Sure, that would all  change in about a month or so, but the girls had earned some rest,  herself included.</p><p>She  was about to alter the gate's view once more when it fuzzed with  static. Sailor Pluto squinted into the gate. A malfunction?  Impossible! She could see through the interference, but the fact that  there was any at all was quite disturbing.</p><p><i>Thmp!  Thmp! <b>CRACK!</b></i></p><p>Light  flashed around her as two dull pressure waves hit, followed  immediately by a concussive shock. She flinched and an angry vortex  of energy snarled about the gate, disgorging a human figure that went  skidding violently across the surface of her part-time prison. The  vortex collapsed in upon itself with a small pop! and Pluto was left  stunned. She brought the key to bear on what appeared to be a young  man whose clothing was smoldering and singed. The boy shook his head  and pushed himself into a sitting position.</p><p>"Uuuhh…  My head…"</p><p>Sailor  Pluto blinked with surprise and completely for got the standard  verbal challenge she would have normally issued. Instead, she opted  for something much simpler.</p><p>"WHO  THE <i>HELL</i> ARE YOU?"</p><p>The  stranger turned his head, noticing her for the first time and blushed  slightly. He stood up wobbly and shook another round of dizziness  off.</p><p>"Um,  I'm Ranma Saotome… Sorry' bout this."</p><b>San</b><p>Ranma  waited for the fog to clear from his vision and found himself staring  at cute, yet very pissed green haired woman. While there was no doubt  as to her attractiveness thanks in no small part to the tiny white  and black fuku she wore, that very same fuku looked absolutely  ridiculous in his humble opinion. Scratch that, he amended silenly as  his eyes were unwillingly drawn up her long, shapely legs. Who am I  to complain about her costume?</p><p>The  woman waved her staff menacingly in his general direction, anger  contorting her features. "Look, I want answers and I want them  NOW."</p><p>The  martial artist scratched his head in embarrassment. "Jeez, I don't  know… One moment I'm flying above Tokyo and the next I'm here."</p><p>Sailor  Pluto was practically dancing with fusteration now. "You expect me  to believe that POOF you just decided to drop by?"</p><p>"Wasn't  my choice…" Ranma shrugged then mumbled something about a stupid  tomboy.</p><p>"Did  you just call me a tomboy?"</p><p>Ranma  slapped himself upside the head. "NoNoNoNo… The person who sent  me here. 'Cides… Nobody could confuse <i>you </i>for a tomboy."  After all, tomboys would NEVER wear something like THAT.</p><p>Sailor  Pluto flushed a bit before regaining her composure. So somebody HAD  sent him here! Well let's just find out who that person is… "So  <i>who</i> sent you again?"</p><p>"Akane."  The pigtailed boy stated flatly. A very sour look crossed his face.</p><p>No love lost there, she realized. If  he's on a secret mission, maybe I can drive a wedge in their  organization and find out why they're trying to infiltrate the  gates… "And this Akane is…?"</p><p>"Violent."  Ranma snorted. "She'll kill me just as soon poison me. Hell, I'd  probably be beaten just for talking to you."</p><p>Sailor  Pluto studied the boy, but allowed her staff to waver. Not exactly  the typical happy henchman, is he? Of course, being beaten, poisoned  and killed didn't exactly endear one to long term employment. This  Akane sounds ruthless enough. A new threat to Crystal Tokyo, then?</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>ANs- <i>Rejected.  Again, it could have been a nice, WAFFy love story, but there wasn't  enough IMO to really separate it from the rest of the fics already  out there. Obviously comedy was the primary focus here</i>.<hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Yeah, the prank war  was a much better choice. After I had written the first two up, I had  resolved to create a plot with as much chaos falling out upon Ranma  as possible, even to the extent of more curses. One idea (that never  moved beyond that stage) was to give Ranma so many curses that the  last one he picked up would some how link all the others in harmony  and benefit him immensily... After a liberal amount of suffering. Yet  another stepping stone to tBoT. Eventially the general frame work for  tBoT came into exitance and there were certain elements I was going  to insist upon. It would remain somewhat canon. There would be a  prank war, but not one that desended into outright death and  destruction like too many other fics. Ranma would wear a fuku, but  not become be a reincarnated anything, let alone a real sailor (let's  count the number of reviews I received on THAT topic). Likewise,  Ranma's powers would scale (I don't like uber Ranma, even when  making her a Goddess one-one). </i><p><i>People will be  somewhat sorry to hear that a Setsuna romance was planned from  keystroke one, and I can't even begin to take credit for one of the  series funniest running jokes; that being Chibi and her incessant  laughter at future events. Details like the Staff of Ascension came  on the fly in trying to decide which of Saffron's staves to  actually use. (duh, let's fuse 'em together!). There was also a  definite ending to this series- Epilogue X1. While there was a number  of people who really wanted to see the prank war continue, I just  couldn't keep it up indefinitely. There would only be so much  escalation before pranks became either boring or downright hostile in  nature. That, and I like going places with my fics, not kite them  indefinitely. </i></p><p><i>Finally, Epilogue X2  was decided at the last moment simply because turning Ranma's brain  inside out with Setsuna's memories was just so darn attractive and  the key scene could have gone either way. Rather than write an  entirely new fic (uhg, got too many of THOSE already), I thought a  branching reality would be pretty cool. It wasn't long before I was  writing myself into a paradox… We were killing off Pluto before she  brought Chibi back, who has a complete set of memories concerning her  timeline. Again, I had several of the fine people at fukufics to  bounce ideas off of and came to (what I think) was one of the more  workable solutions available.</i></p><p><i>I probably left out  a lot of details, but hopefully the chapter ANs fill in the gaps. </i></p><p><i>Now, the preview of  AMR ½ Part 5.<hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p><b>Oh  My Ranma ½!<br/>No  Need for Wishes!</b><br/>Started:  05Aug05</p><p><b>Forward:</b> <i>The Tenchi  universe has no less than three alternate timelines to choose from,  so be advised I'm going to play fast and loose all of them from  here on out. Don't expect strict adherence to any one since you  can't make everybody happy all the time. I'll make every attempt  to keep the core plot surrounding Tenchi intact, however.</i></p><p><b>Chapter 4</b></p><p>Ranma popped out  of the lake with ease and floated lightly onto the property of the  Masaki shrine. It really was a beautifully place, she decided.  Secluded on a nice hillside with the house and lake below, surrounded  by forest. You could get used to it, she thought agreeably and popped  her head into one of the structures.</p><p>"Anybody home?"</p><p>Tenchi Masaki  scampered across the wooden floor he had been sweeping with a small  start, but recovered his wits when he recognized Ranma. The student  gave the floor another swipe and wiped the sweat from his brow. He  noticed she was in her casual Chinese attire and Tenchi smiled at the  Goddess as she stepped closer.</p><p>"So what's up,  Tenchi?"</p><p>"I don't think  that wish thing worked. Not that I need it I guess," He added  hastily, "But it would be a shame after all the trouble I put you  through."</p><p>Ranma shrugged.  "Well that's why I'm here. To make sure it <i>does</i> work."  …And that you don't get abducted by aliens or something, she  amended as an afterthought.</p><p>"Really?"  Tenchi seemed taken back. "I mean, I don't want to keep you from  something important, you know."</p><p>Well I'd love to  do that, she thought sarcastically, but you had to go and wish that  stupid— She stopped her train of thought short and began to examine  her attitude very carefully.</p><p>This <i>was</i>  her job. Granting wishes. It <i>was</i> important. A matter of <i>honor  </i>even, if she wanted to put it into a martial arts context. Maybe  things hadn't turned out the way she would like them to, but it was  still her job to make sure it turned out right. Quit yer whining  Ranma, she rebuked herself. You knew full well what you were getting  into when you signed on the dotted line with kami-sama. This was the  sacrifice He was talking about. This was the servant's duty Urd had  explained. If you can't perform these duties with the same honor as  The Art, you probably shouldn't be teaching it either!</p><p>Mentally  redressed, Ranma favored Tenchi with her trademark roguish grin.</p><p>"Hey, don't  worry 'bout it. I'll just stick around here with you and see what  we can dig up, kay?" …And <i>still</i> make sure you don't get  abducted my space aliens, she smiled quietly. Tenchi nodded with  enthusiasm. "So where's your grandfather, anyway?"</p><p>"Probably on the  other side of the lake…" Tenchi replied, setting aside the broom.  Even as he finished, the mischievous gleam of realization gleamed in  his eyes. "And that means now's my chance!" Ranma looked at him  curiously as he ran over to the desk and began rifling through its  contents.</p><p>Ranma bent over  beside him as he flipped through another folder. "Whatcha looking  for?"</p><p>He paused  momentarily. "Keys. I'm going to finally see what we've been  keeping in that old shrine."</p><p>"And what's  supposed to be in there?"</p><p>"A demon slaying  blade!" Tenchi replied, pulling open another drawer. "Gramps  keeps going on about this old legend about how an ancient warrior  named Yosho defeated a demon that could destroy mountains with the  thing."</p><p>The Goddess of  Luck watched him hurry through his search and weighed her options.  She could either sit around and watch him do chores all day, waiting  for some alien to come along and marry him <i>or</i>… She smiled  mischeviously. "What do ya need a key for?" Tenchi paused in his  search. "I <i>am</i> a Goddess after all."</p><p>Tenchi's eyes  widened momentarily before the implication set it "Alright! Let's  go then!" Tenchi quickly abandoned his chores and the two vacated  the room with haste.</p><p>Less than ten  minutes later Katsuhito Masaki stood in the doorway of the empty  room, finding his charge noticeably absent from his duties. He  stroked his bearded white chin, absently wondering where he had ran  off to. The grandfather knew it wouldn't be the temple since he had  the keys, so Tenchi was probably off taking a break somewhere.  Suspicions mollified for the moment, Katsuhito went to kitchen to  grab a snack.</p><p>Ranma watched  Tenchi yank the sword out of the ancient shrine with some curiosity.  He flipped it around they both examined it carefully. Definitely not  a katana, Ranma decided. The strait lines of the scabbard and the  oddly designed hilt were evidence enough of that. While the Anything  Goes School didn't necessarily emphasis the use of edged weaponry,  it didn't neglect it either. The student growled with strain as he  attempted to pull the scabbard free. Wasn't Chinese either, she  realized. Infact, the entire hilt design was much too exotic to  be—The blade finally snapped free and in Tenchi's hands rested  the weapon that once slew mighty demons. Both teens frowned.</p><p>"Your sword's  a piece of junk, Tenchi." The dejected Goddess commented upon  seeing the rust eaten stick of metal that was once a blade.</p><p>Tenchi wasn't  exactly happy either. "Give me a break… This thing is supposed to  cut through rock?" He gave it a careless slice and shattered the  ancient blade across one of the warding stones, which promptly split  clean in two. Ranma only had a moment to be surprised when a small  pebble bounced off her head and the entire cave began to rumble. She  looked up in time to find a huge boulder in freefall. A quick  sidestep saw the stone imbed itself into the earth beside her and she  twitched visibly at the thought of becoming a Saotome pancake.</p><p>Tenchi abandoned  the stone he was attempting to piece back together just as the  boulder slammed home. Both looked at one another, then the now broken  sword in his hand. A light breeze brushed by them and Ranma's brush  with death was forgotten as they sought the source, a wide fissure in  the far cave wall that definitely hadn't been there before. The  redhead shrugged and Tenchi squeezed through, Ranma following close  behind. The only illumination came from a shaft of light that had  somehow managed to piece the cave's ceiling, but it wasn't enough  to see the standing water the boy promptly stepped in. Or the  stalactite that jumped in front of his forehead. Or the slippery  section of the finely machined incline he now tried to stand upright  on, with little success. The hilt of the ruined sword clattered into  the pit as he flailed wildly to maintain his balance, grabbing on to  the first object within reach.</p><p>Unfortunately that  just happened to be Ranma's arm and the two hit the ground, sliding  wildly down the dark shaft where they were deposited a hundred feet  later in a most compromising position. It would have been a great  position had they been lovers. Urd would have approved. Maybe even  watched. Tenchi covered the redhead like a blanket and there was no  body part not left touching one another. The pair's eyes were  locked on to one another as both faces began to progress through  multiple shades of pink. Tenchi, being the passive sort simply laid  their in shock on top of her while Ranma was still trying to decide  exactly why she was letting him do so. The Boy part of her psyche  voted to snap his neck. The girl, Ranma noted with some surprise was  a bit of a hentai. She voted in favor of pulling the handsome student  into something more than just a kiss. The goddess winced and  ruthlessly suppressed her before settling for something diplomatic,  yet to the point.</p><p>"Get off me  before I snap yer neck."</p><p><i>I know it sucks to  give you 1kW worth of text when there is 7k's worth here in my hot  little hands, but them's the breaks.
