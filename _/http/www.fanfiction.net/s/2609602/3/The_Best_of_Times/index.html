</div><p><b>The Best of Times…</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i><br/>A Fukufics (dotcom)  Production</p><p><b>Part Three</b></p><p>"<b>O</b>h my.."</p><p>Never in history had  two words been responsible for conveying so much information as when  uttered by Kasumi Tendo, matriarch of the Tendo household. For most  people, these words were a subdued exclamation of concern. But to the  eldest Tendo sister, they were so much more. She was the keeper of  those words and they literally held hundreds of meanings. "Oh my"  when voiced by Kasumi could mean anything from "Oh my, the  cooking needs a dash of salt" to "Oh my, body snatching aliens  have just landed in the yard and are about to employ large quantities  of anti-matter weaponry to annihilate the last vestiges of human life  from the face of the earth…"</p><p>No doubt Ranma Saotome  would be responsible for the latter one way or the other, but that  was beside the point.</p><p>The reality of the  situation concerning Kasumi and her "Oh my's " was that she was  a lot like Lassy, in that only the trained ear could accurately  discern her actual meaning. Where as the casual listener might only  hear "Woof! Woof!" Kasumi's sisters would hear "Two divisions  of mutant aliens have landed at 12403.51 north by 34011.88 east with  heavy tacheon cannons and the insatiable need for human flesh, send  help!" This particular "Oh my" however, was midrange, falling  somewhere between a mild expression of concern and a call to  attention. As such, Nabiki, looked up from the tabloid she had been  flipping through on the living room couch and Akane Tendo paused in  her aerobic dumbbell workout to stare at the TV. Even Ranma paused on  his way up to his room in curiosity. Kasumi turned the TV up slightly  as she sipped her tea.</p><p>"<i>Tonight's top  story is the continuation of Youma attacks centered in the suburb of  Tokyo known as Juuban. Reports are still coming in as to the number of  injuries, but casualties were once again prevented by the Guardians  of Love and Justice, the Sailor Senshi…"</i></p><p>The scene cut from the  news anchor to a video clip of said magical girls in the process of  annihilating a particularly rampant youma outbreak centered on a  crowded market place. Magical attacks lashed out as the  scampering demons where eliminated one by one before they could cause  too much damage. "Too much damage" was, of course, a relative  term when concerning the Senshi given the destructive nature of their  intervention, but the cure was normally more acceptable than the  disease itself… Which just happened to be unidentifiable demonic  aliens that stole peoples souls and rend them limb from limb.</p><p>Kasumi sighed. "Maybe  I'll be able to get Sailor Moon's autograph one of these days."  Akane smirked. Kasumi was a closet Senshi addict with a dresser  nearly filled with every publication concerning the heroines of Love  and Justice.</p><p>"I don't see what's  so special about Moon," Akane commented, gaining Kasumi's  attention. "Now if you happen stumble across Sailor Mercury's  autograph…" While she wasn't the otaku her sister was, there  was just something just plain exciting about transforming into a  magical girl and fighting demons… As if getting kidnapped by the  villain of the month wasn't enough for her. That, and she felt a  certain affinity to the Senshi and her short crop of cobalt blue  hair.</p><p>"Feh." Ranma  sniffed. "Sailor Uranus is the best one of the bunch skill wise."</p><p>Nabiki arched an  eyebrow with an "Oh?" inviting him to continue. He now had the  attention of all three sisters.</p><p>"Sure, " Ranma  continued, heedless of the darkened waters he was wading into. "I  mean, everything I've seen says she's at least a dan in Kempo."</p><p>"Hmmm…" Kasumi  considered throughtfully. "What about Jupiter-san? She seems to  know martial arts, and her Supreme thunder attack is quite  formidable.'</p><p>Ranma shook his head.  "True, but Akane could kick her butt , no problem. Besides,  what's a bit of lightening compared to a World Shaker?"</p><p>"There's her space  sword too…" Akane commented, beaming with pride over the fact  that Ranma had classified her skill level as better than that of a  Sailor Senshi. With that in mind, Jupiter was obviously <i>not</i> a  respectable teenage idol.</p><p>"'Cides," Ranma  continued in a conspiratorial whisper. "Rumor has it that she and  Neptune have a 'thing'"</p><p>Kasumi blinked and  Akane gasped. "You mean she's… <i>a Pervert?</i>" The  martial artist nodded.</p><p>"Oh my." Kasumi  blinked again. "Where did you hear this, Ranma-kun?"</p><p>He shrugged. "It was  an article in last week's 'Tokyo Candy Teen'." Conversation  stopped and an uneasy silence hung in the air as three sisters stared  at Akane's fiancée and future brother in law. Ranma's eyes  flicked from one sister to the next as he began to comprehend the  grievous fax pause he had just committed. "…Not that I'd <i>know</i>  anything about stupid magical girls."</p><p>"Or teen girls  magazines?" Nabiki pointed out helpfully.</p><p>"Er… Yeah. Those  too." Ranma's face was now glowing red from embarrassment.  Akane's mouth was hanging wide open at the prospect of Ranma,  manly-man martial artist, being a Sailor Senshi otaku as big as her  sister <i>and</i> collecting teen girl tabloids. Either way, it spelled  "Pervert' with a capital 'P'.</p><p>Kasumi considered the  boy in front of her thoughtfully. "Would you mind if I borrowed  that issue, Ranma-kun?"</p><p>Ranma Saotome, heir to  the Anything goes School of Martial Arts twitched. Violently. "Oh,  look at the time! Gotta go!"</p><p>Nabiki could only grin  as the pigtailed boy existed the house post haste. Ah, it's the  simple pleasures in life…</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma blew through  another kata on a hillside some distance away from his usual stomping  grounds. The purpose was two fold, in reality- First, it provided  and outlet for the terminal case of embarrassment he had just  suffered only an hour ago. Second, he needed the practice. The  martial artist flipped around and the cresent blade of the Gekkaja  cut through the air. In the opposite hand was the Kinjakan, its  lethal ring tip flashing in the sunlight as he snapped it toward a  boulder. The ring sliced through the air, missed the boulder and  behead several trees before returning to it station on the staff tip  with a snap.<p>Damn.</p><p>The martial artist  sighed. He was definitely going to have to put in overtime if he was  going to be able to competently wield both staves simuaneously. Using  one at a time would undoubtably be easier, he realized, but the  potential both held when used in tandem was simply to great to  ignore. In his hands he held the powers of fire and ice, two elements  with which he had been well schooled in over the past two and a half  years. The potential these two weapons held alone was enormous, but  if he could build a style that used them together… Be that as it  may, it wasn't the primary reason he had pulled the staves out of  storage. His plan concerning the Pluto was simple—Infiltrate the  Sailor Senshi and cause her grief to no end until she either  confront him or backed off. For that, his girl-type needed a costume.  Ranma Saotome really wasn't looking forward to that particular  aspect of his plan, but posing as a female Senshi constituted a  formidable tactical advantage that he simply couldn't pass up,  especially when he could do so without The Meddler's knowledge.</p><p>As horrid as it was,  the costume was the easy part, but she also needed a prop to go with  it. Every magical girl carried around a magical weapon, and for the  deception to work, he'd have to as well. Or she'd have to,  rather. He'd already considered buying a length of iron piping,  spray painting it and call it a magical staff, but decided against  the idea. No, Ranma needed the real thing, or at least something  similar. Saffron's Keys of Ascention were the only things he had  that would even come close to fitting the bill, and the only question  now would be which one would he choose? Either way, he'd keep  practicing the dual wield method. Maybe whip both out in an  emergency… Or to lay some smackdown on a certain green-haired  Senshi if it came to that.</p><p>Ranma launched into  another kata, attempting to refine his flowing ring striking  technique when the decision  of which staff to use was made for him.  Ranma flicked the Kinjakan outward and the ring whistled away at high  speed, carving a piece out of the targeted boulder with something  less than a direct hit. Even as Ranma tumbled, slicing forward with the  Gekkaja, the ring arced on back to its owner. His arms crossed in a  final lunge forward and the ring snapped back into place as both  staves now pointed off to his sides, poised to cleave the rock directly  in front of the pigtailed boy. Ranma powered up with  determination, preparing to obliterate the offending boulder when it  happened- Something in both staves felt the power and one recognized  the other through the link that was Ranma's ki. The keys were the polar  opposites to one  another, yet less than a handful of people in existance knew their true  form. The keys activated and Ranma 's cross-cleave was  superceded as the staves pulled toward one another. His eyes widened  as the power coursed through him and between the weapons, while it  was all he could do to follow through with the chop and keep the ends  from joining. The attraction was too great and Ranma 's  cross-grip failed to keep the staves from snapping together in a  blinding flash that sent him tumbling off balance. The martial artist  pushed himself back off  the ground and waited for his vision to clear. What he found  in his hands after it did, however, defied belief.</p><p>The staves plural were no more. In their place was a meter long silver staff  with elements of each key imbedded at either end. On one end sat the  Kinjakan's lethal ring.. At the other was the Gekkaja's crescent  blade. Ranma cocked his head, considering the transformed weapon  resting in his hands. Now THIS is more like it, Ranma thought and  twirled the staff easily. He set up for another kata, determined to carve up the countryside with his new toy.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was late in the day  when Ranma finally stumbled through the door. The groan that escaped  his lips ensured all eyes were riveted to his person. It helped that  his clothing was in complete shambles.<p>"What the hell  happened to you, boy?" Genma asked as he watched his son  trudged by.</p><p>"New technique."  The boy in question winced, pausing before the family. Akane <i>was</i> thinking about malleting him for being a Senshi Otaku girlie Magazine loving  freak, but noticed <i>that</i> particular job had already been  self-inflicted.</p><p>"Some move," She  snorted, observing the numerous cuts and lacerations across her  fiancee's body. "Remind me <i>not</i> to learn that one."</p><p>Ranma favored her with  a dry look and turned to trudge up stairs when a slight cough caused  him to pause once more. "Ranma-kun, I was wondering if I could also borrow  issue #132 of 'Sakura Go! Now!'?"</p><p>Akane twitched, a scowl  spreading across her face. Genma's eyes narrowed onto him sharply.  "What's this, Boy?"</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened  suddenly as he focused on the eldest Tendo sister. "Um, Kasumi…?"</p><p>""I must say, your  Senshi collection is almost as big as mine." Kasumi mentioned with  an oblivious smile. "We might have to start trading off."</p><p>"How did you…?"</p><p>"Cleaning your room."  She replied happily. Truth be told, she had to engaged in some 'deep'  cleaning in order to find out where he was storing his collection and  just how big it actually was. Kasumi was pleasantly surprised by her  find.</p><p>"As in the <i>Sailor</i>  Senshi?" His father growled, and took a step forward. Nodoka pursed  her lips thoughtfully, trying to decide whether his Senshi obsession  was good in the fact that he was attracted to the harem of magical  girls or bad as pertaining to his concering purchase of teen girls  publications.</p><p>Ranma hung his head,  now thoroughly depressed. "Sure. Why not. After my bath." Kasumi  nodded and he struggled to ignore the remaining family's staring as  he walked up stairs, sliding open the guest room door. He took a step  in and froze, locking onto the dozens upon dozens of glittering eyes.</p><p>"Meow."</p><p><i>"AHHHHARAaaaAAARR!"  </i>Ranma scampered back as a small black and white cat hopped forward  from the masses, eager to make his acquaintance. The pigtailed boy  hit the wall and began to run down the hall where Nuku Nuku had just  stepped out of the bathroom in little more than a towel, curious as  to the sudden commotion. Her face lit up in a smile as she saw Ranma  practically leaping towards her, the towel falling away as she  reached out to embrace him "Husband Ranma-kun!" He plowed strait  into the cat girl, knocking her nude body over and landing both in a  very compromising position, where upon the remaining contingent of  cats poured out of the room and swarmed over the pair.</p><p>"GET EM OFF! GET EM  OFF! CAAAaaaAAAATTTSSS!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Half a dimension away,  Setsuno Meiou was laughing hysterically as the scene played out in  front of her. The cats alone were great, but even she couldn't have  planned him running strait into the nude cat-girl! The Guardian of  Time broke out into another roun fit of laughter, clutching her side in  pain.<p>God, payback wasn't  simply a bitch, it was therapeutic as well!</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Home plate, this is  Outfield… We have the target."<p>"Roger Outfield,"  Kyouko keyed the mic in response. "Which one is it?"</p><p>"Both. Awaiting  instructions." Officer Kyouko considered the reply carefully. Teams  two and five were in position, but she had only been expecting the  new type android, not pink-haired one as well.</p><p>"Alright," she  decided. "Team one, move to five's flank for fire support." The  blonde switched channels. "Ready Ris-chan?"</p><p>Two blocks away, Arisa  steadied the fifty caliber anti-vehical sniper rifle along the  rooftop ledge. The salary woman squinted through the scope, focusing  its crosshairs down on the pigtailed android walking along a  fence top. Below him was a girl with shorter, cobalt blue hair and  beside her, the NK 1124, otherwise known as Nuku Nuku. She tilted the  rifle slightly and the crosshairs now came to rest on Nuku. Choices,  choices… "Ready Sa-chan."</p><p>There was a slight  pause over the com. "Remember, incapacitate only… NO headshots."</p><p>Arisa grumbled and  nudged the crosshairs off the cat-girl's head. "Fine, fine! Ruin my  fun…"</p><p>Back in the nondescript  plain white van sitting just outside Fruikan High, Kyouko keyed the  general channel once more. "All units, go, no go?"</p><p>"Armor one, go."</p><p>"Armor two, go."</p><p>"Heavy weapons five,  go."</p><p>"Sniper, go."</p><p>Kyouko nodded, glancing  at a tech manning the console beside her. He gave her the thumbs up  and she smiled. "Fire teams, lock and load."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Relinquish thy hold  on the pigtailed goddess, evil sorcerer!" Tatewake Kuno demanded  of Ranma with the point of his bokken.<p>"Look, baka, I've  had a super bad weekend, so why don't you—"</p><p>"What's this!"  The upper classman interrupted and rushed to the girl at Ranma's  side. "How has thee been so blessed as to perceive the visage of a  pink haired Goddess! What is your given name, fair maiden?"</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes  and the girl flashed a look of uncertainty. "Nuku Nuku?"</p><p>"AH!" The deranged  student exclaimed. "I shall date thee, my pink goddess!" Ranma  bit his retort back. Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.  The less time spent around cat girl, the better, and Kuno would  surely occupy—</p><p>"No."</p><p>Ranma and Kuno's head  rolled on a swivel to face the girl in question. "No?"</p><p>"I date my husband,  Ranma!" She chirped happily. Ranma's twitch like reflexes around  cat-grils were not fast enough to compensate for the <i>robotic</i>  cat-girl's glomp. He ground his teeth together, biting back the  fear.</p><p>"HUSBAND?" Kuno  raged. "Is there no end to your wickedness, Saotome!" The body of  students around them rippled in agreement and the hentai horde  stepped forward menacingly. Normally the mob wouldn't think to  challenge Nerima's premier martial artist, but one can only take  the usurping of so many beautiful women from their ranks. "I shall  NOT allow this, Fien-!"</p><p><i>BOOOOoooMMM!</i></p><p>The far wall  disintegrated in a massive fireball, and three suits of red power  armor stepped through the smoldering ruins. "Not again…" Ranma  groused as all eyes turned on the newcomers. If those corporate  freaks- and Setsuna by proxy -kept this up, they'd drive him  insane. Or… Ranma's thought process cut into overdrive. "You  got it wrong, Kuno!" The upperclassman tore his attention away from  the advancing suits. "I'm trying to protect her… From THOSE  GUYS!"</p><p>Kuno blinked. "Verily…?  What foul designs have they upon my pink goddess?"</p><p>"They uh…" Ranma  stumbled through the explanation, making it up as he went. "They  plan to, um, clone her and use her to pilot a, um, a giant robot  against hideous super-powered monsters! She'll be a slave!"</p><p>"No…!"</p><p>"Yes! And if she's  killed, they'll simply clone her again…" Ranma sure hoped his  look of mock horror did the trick. He needn't have worried.</p><p>"…Thereby  sentencing the fair pink-haired maiden to a life of un-death and  servitude!" Kuno finished, fire flashing in his eyes. He strode to  the front of the horde, pointing his sword high. "I WILL NOT ALLOW  THIS!"</p><p>Akane, Nabiki and Ranma  stared at one another in total disbelief, the same thought running  through their brains simultaneously: "Oh my God, I can't believe  he actually fell for that."</p><p>"Your trespasses  shall not stand, foul mechanized demons!" Kuno fumed and took an  attack stance. The horde stood at the ready, tennis rackets, hockey  sticks, baseball bats and other assorted sports equipment in hand.  "Furikan shall not abide by your presence! <b><i>CHARGE!"</i></b></p><p>Ranma's mouth fell  open. He wasn't alone as the Tendo's witnessed what amounted to a  good old-fashioned infantry charge against the three suits of power  armor. Ranma would have loved to sit and watch the inevitable  attrition take place, but soon found his hands full with other  matters. Another wall exploded and three more suits appeared out of  nowhere, walking towards them. Ranma cracked his knuckles with a  smile, and both Akane and Nuku took their own battle stances on his  flank.</p><p>"Trust me, this'll  hurt you more than it will…"</p><p>A massive thud shook  the ground, interrupting Ranma's monologue. The  front gate into the school had just been crushed by a Mishima Heavy  Industries Madcat battle mech, which now stepped halfway onto the school  grounds. The torso swung around, allowing Ranma and company to  clearly see the business ends three pulse lasers hanging from each  arm, while two boxes of forty short range missiles rode high upon  shoulder mounts. The ground shook once more as the massive construct  took another step forward.</p><p>"…me?" Ranma  sighed and began to seriously reconsider that oath as a martial  artist, especially concerning one Sailor Pluto. One of the mech's  arms raised to fire and Nuku Nuku was already gone, leaping high into  the air and down heavily onto the arm, knocking it's first round of  energy fire away. The errant blast torched a portion of the soccer  field and Nuku continued her assault on the machine. Ranma  shrugged, turning back to the trio of power armor. The first suit raised its  own weapon, a wrist mounted particle cannon, and the martial artists  blurred in under the arm to unleashing nearly five hundred strikes into  it armored midsection in under three seconds. The plating cracked and  the suit was blown back and through an undamaged section of wall.  Ranma recovered from the strike and a blue glow began to form in his  hand. The second suit desperately tried to wheel around, but there  was no way he would intercept the attack in time….</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A blonde woman watched  her display in shock as suit three from team two suddenly went yellow  with damage. The shock deepened as the computer reported the Madcat's  left weapons arm critically damaged, followed by several sections of  armor. Team one looked to be faring better, but the helmet cam Kyouko  pulled up showed them wading through a mob of hostile bodies. Dammit,  they shouldn't be encountering this much resistance at a school!<p>Kyouko keyed the mic.  "Snipers free! Take the androids out!" her command was followed  by a sharp crack, shortly followed by another. And another. Five  shots later, a giant sweat drop rolled down her head. "I said  sniping, not suppression fire!"</p><p>Arisa was not a happy  camper as she cracked another fifty caliber bullet downrange and into  the afterimage of her pigtailed target. <i>Again.</i> "WHAT THE HELL?"  Nothing should be able to move that damn fast! The rifle clicked  empty and she released the clip, slapping another home automatically.  She began to line up the mark once more as it wove between the three  powered suits that made up Team two. The android's first victim had  rejoined the battle, slightly worse for the wear and luckily the odds  were still in their fav—Another flash of light and one of the suits  was blown into a crater twenty feet away. The smoke cleared and it  became evident that either the pilot or his suit were out. Arisa  sneered and decided to Nuku was probably the better- read: easier  -target. The pink haired robot wasn't much better as it flipped  around and over the massive frame of the Madcat, denying it any sort  of targeting opportunity against herself or her cohorts. The cat-girl  landed on the arm once more and Arisa took her shot. Or shots,  rather. All three missed and dug into the weapons arm, which promptly  fell to the ground and onto a nondescript white van with a crunch.</p><p>"Oh no, I did <i>not  </i>just do that…"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>An hour later, the  grounds had finally gone silent, save the occasional moan of wounded  here and there. Ranma gave the suit of power armor at his feet and  the occupant inside a kick before turning his attention elsewhere. It  had been a true battle royal, he observed, scanning the carnage. He  had dispatched two suits of armor himself while the third had strayed  too close to Akane. Nearly everything the girl threw at the suit  missed, but it only took one hit from the enraged girl to put the  thing out of commission. Nuka Nuka had done quite well on her own,  severely damaging the giant robot before Ryoga stumbled into the  battle, saw Akane in danger and finished the thing off with his  Breaking Point technique.<p>The Kuno infantry  charge didn't fare quite so well, though the Hentai Horde came away  victorious none the less. It wasn't the horde's speed or skill  that finally won the skirmish, but their staying power. After a few  years of being beaten down by Akane Tendo, their 'never say die'  attitude finally wore the suits out, completely depleting them of  power cells before the last student collapsed.</p><p>Their valiant leader  was struck down in the first five minutes, however.</p><p>The school itself was a disaster area. Any building not reduced to component rumble were  undoubtedly on fire or had a large hole in them as the paramedics  circled around to treat the wounded. Given the amount of firepower  employed by their unknown opponents, casualties were surprisingly  nonexistent. This was probably due to the hardened nature of both the  structures themselves and the students. Besides, what better place to  stage an all out land war then at a school who saw similar events on  a regular basis? Any student that couldn't handle the punishment  already had the brains or experience to get the hell out of Dodge before everything hit the fan. Word had already  spread that The Battle of Kuno had succeeded in putting the school  out of commission for at least two months, which was fine with Ranma.</p><p>After all, the  pigtailed martial artist had things to do, places to go and people to  see. <i>Especially</i> people to see.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The Box.<p>The shape was one to be  feared as Ranma stared at the object lying on his futon. Truth be  told, it wasn't necessarily the box that was to be feared, but what  was inside the box. Inside the box was a man's worst nightmare  beyond those of feline origin… Femininity. Pure, undistilled  feminity in the form of a Sailor Senshi fuku. It was manly kryptonite  to be sure, but Ranma had few choices left available at the moment.  It was obvious that Pluto was stepping up her operations against him,  and at the pace she was setting, Ranma had no doubts that he would go  insane inside six months. He took another sweep of the house to make  sure everybody had well and truly departed for the beach and tore  open the dark pink paper wrapping.</p><p>Even as he lifted the  top off, Ranma addressed the other issues that would need  taken care of, like that of a code name. All the Senshi had a magical  girl name, so his alter ego was going to have to have one as well.  Not only that, but if he was going to interact with them normally,  his girl-type was going to have to need a new name as well. No way  would he risk dropping "Ranko" around ol' Pluto either. No  reason to give her a link back to the Tendos or potentially jar her memory  suddenly. Ranma unfolded the dark red and white fuku from the box and  clinically admired the tailoring job. Better that then dwell on the  fact that he was about to try the damn thing on, right? Also in the  box were white and red trimmed elbow length gloves with almost  knee-high boots to match. The final item was a white gold tiara with  a polished imitation ruby set in the center. All in all, worth every  penny he paid for the outfit… If he were actually <i>into</i> that sort of  thing to begin with. As it was, the fact that he was even holding the  outfit in his hands was just this side of disturbing, so he rectified  that problem with a quick trip to the bathroom and returned as a she.  Ranma picked the fuku back up and shook her head. Nope, still  disturbing as hell. She really wasn't looking forward to this. Of  course, it wouldn't be the first time either. At least this time it  would be for the greater good, as opposed to being blackmailed into playing  dressup.</p><p>Steeling  herself, Ranma  slipped out of her Chinese silks and into the frilly costume, noting it  was a lot like a leotard. Not that the fact made her feel any better,  especially when this particular leotard was  quite frilly and quite revealing. It was also horribly sad that  she knew what a leotard felt like in the first  seemstress even had the  foresight to build in a bra. <i>Yay</i>. She slid the boots on first, then  the gloves, noting that it was all horribly tight. Obviously the  suits had originally been designed by a child molester or somebody with a  similarly perverted hang-up. Lastly came the tiara. Ranma stepped in  front of the mirror and blinked.</p><p>"Wow... I make this  look <i>good</i>…" she mumbled and spun around, viewing herself  from every angle. The skirt itself was a dark crimson red with the  upper body being pure white, while orange bow straddling her breasts.  The girl in the mirror still looked too much like Ranma though, so the pigtail had to go. She untied the dragon whisker and her  hair floated down to her shoulders, totally altering her appearance.  Ranma nodded. That'll do. Now a name to go with the face. Tough  one, that. The Senshi had already taken all of the planets and she  sure as hell wasn't going to settle for a mere moon…. Hmmm…  Sailor Nebula? Nah. Comet? Nope. Meteor? Uh-uh. Dammit… Sailor Sun?  Weak. Ranma struck a pose in front of the mirror as she mulled over  the question. Something that represents massive, overwhelming power…  Sailor Death Star? Ehhh… Overwhelming power… Overwhelming power…</p><p><i>"Sailor Nova."</i></p><p>Ranma  smiled as she  said the name aloud, then pulled the fused Key of Ascension from  weapons space so that she could  view the entire package. Her mouth hung open slightly. She was an  honest to goodness goddamn magical girl! She brought a knuckle to her  lips. Now her alter ego would need a name. 'Ranko' was too hot to touch  with a ten-foot pole for this operation, so she would need something  else. After a few shots in the dark and a magazine later, she pieced  together the name Yumei Ikari, if only because she liked how it rolled  off the tongue.</p><p>Ranma's ki sense  pinged and she knew somebody familiar was coming home. Her maximum  range was about two miles for general detection, which gave her  several minutes before anybody hit the front door. Now the last  part—Transforming. She had given the matter considerable thought  and there was no way she could duplicate a magical girl  transformation outright. Nor would she want to, given their  propensity towards gratuitous nudity. But that's where the Anything Goes  School of Martial Arts Speed Dressing came into play. When combined with a  flash of blinding ki generated light, Ranma was back in her Chinese  garb less than two seconds later while the Sailor Nova uniform and  Ascension Staff were neatly tucked away in weapons space. The front door clicked  open and Ranma knew the Tendo's day at the beach had  concluded. Ranma bound her hair with the whisker as footsteps serperated from the downstairs chatter. Ranma  poked his head out of his room to see who was coming up stairs.</p><p>"Oh hey, Ranma."  Nabiki greeted easily and turned toward her room. "Did you hear…"  She stopped in front of her door, voice suddenly trailing off. She  turned toward the redhead with a queer expression on her face and  walked back over, holding out her hand. "Two thousand yen."</p><p>Ranma studied the  sister for a moment and decided that the expression she wore was so  unusual that she had to bite, slapping a couple bills into her  hand. Nabiki blinked and reached up to the girl's forehead, pulling  off a white gold tiara. Ranma's eyes widened suddenly and she  snatched the prop back, stammering desperately.</p><p>Nabiki shook her head.  "Forget it, Saotome. I really don't even want to know this time."  With that, she returned to her room mumbling something to herself.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<i>Burning Mandala!"</i><p>A  burning line of flame  trailed from Sailor Mars' fingers as she whipped around, creating  eight balls of fire that pulsed around her before collapsing into  a waiting hand. The energy than condensed,  incenerating the wayward youma via magical burning rings of death. Rei  Hino allowed herself a slight smile, but the joy was short lived. One  down, seven more to go.</p><p>"Where the heck did  they all come from, Mercury!" Sailor Venus cried out as she was  being double teamed by two of the unengaged monstrosities. The orange  and white clad blonde called forth her attack, and the glowing chain  of hearts tore into one of her opponents. It wasn't a lethal blow,  but creature was far less eager to press its advantage in numbers.  Like most youma, these vaguely resembled something female, but their  appendages seemed to be long and stringy, while their arms ended in  sharp, boney sword points. The skin rippled a sickly grayish-pink and  what would have been hair jetted along their backs in a spikey mane  that was as solid as the bone-tips. Venus' more eager opponent  happily rushed in to skewer the Senshi, who hopped back outside  engagement range. She whipped the Love Me Chain outward once more and  convinced the second beast to give her some breathing room.</p><p>The wounded one  reconsidered its options and charged, only to be impaled by some Moon  Tiara Action courtesy of Sailor Moon. Its victim tumbled to the  ground and evaporated on the spot. Venus gave her a nod and re-engaged  her second opponent.</p><p>Mercury sent a pillar  of water crashing into a lone youma and pulled out her link to the  Mercury computer. It was good question she decided and began to scan  for anything anything unsusal. Beyond the fact that youma were  apparently being bred like jackrabbits in this particular area of  town, that is. "I've got traces of the porthole they rode in on,  but it's too decayed to know where it came from…"</p><p>By the time Sailor  Mercury looked up from the link, three youma had managed break past  Usagi and Minako to close on her position. She frowned. "Uh oh…  Um, guys…?"</p><p>The attack was  simultaneous and she knew there was nowhere near the time needed to power up  a Shabon Spray. Mercury prepared to roll away when a flaming incandescent ring whistled out of the blue sky, neatly decapitating  all three youma as it continued through a tight arc. "What  the…?" That was definitely <i>not</i> a Moon Tiara! Her eyes tracked  the disk through the sky and over to a nearby roof top where it was recovered  by Sailor…</p><p>"Who the heck is  that!" Mercury exclaimed at the sight. The other three Senshi  disengaged and took a good look at the girl on high, who had just  dispatched three youma in a single attack. The stranger then proceed  to flip through the air and land lightly next to Inners, who could  only stare at the newcomer.</p><p>"Su-Su-Sugoi…"  Mercury stammered, and for once, Moon was able to produce a more  intelligent question than her counterpart.</p><p>"Who… Who <i>are</i>  you?"</p><p>A lopsided grin found  its way to the redhead's face. "I'm here to get this  party started." Nova twirled the exotic staff expertly in her hand,  walking past the group and over to the remaing youma, who were still  somewhat stunned that they had lost 1/3rd of their total  strength in a single attack. "Who wants some?" The monster's  beady little eyes began to flick back and forth. Escape was looking  like a mighty good option at the moment. The volatile stellar anomaly  got tired of waiting. "You." She pointed the crescent blade at  the tallest creature. "<i>You</i> want some."</p><p>Before the youma  could in some way deny that it wanted <i>any</i>, Ranma gave it to her,  blurring forward in burst of speed that left an after image in her  wake. The Sailors at her back gaped collectively. The crescent  imbedded itself into the youma's torso point three seconds later,  turning its chest cavity into a solid block of ice. Sailor Nova  reversed the staff in distorted arc, cleaving the mass in two  with the bladed ring. The ice crumbled and what  remained of the youma promply disintegrated, sending its essence back  to monster hell. The strike continued into the monster on her  right, feed power into the ring and causing it to burst  into flames. Two chops later, nothing remained of Nova's victim  save a pile of ash.</p><p>The third youma  actually had the common sense to work on its strategic withdraw, and  the new Senshi brought her staff back, ready to introduce it to  ringed death. She never got the chance as her target was suddenly interdicted by a sizable amount of  firepower. The four Inners cut loose at once, vaporizing it and a  large chunk of the realistate the youma had been running across. Sailor  Nova blinked at the smoldering crater and shrugged, turning back  toward the Senshi.</p><p>This time, Mercury had  a better handle on what she wanted to ask the new Senshi. "WHO THE HECK ARE  YOU?" She blurted and the redhead produced a mischievous smile.</p><p>"I'm Sailor Nova. Sorry  about this." She answered, and abruptly disappeared before their  very eyes.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's Notes-</b><br/>I'm telling you, this  is getting more and more fun to write with each chapter in. it's all I  can do to keep from cackling maniacally as I type.
