</div><p><b>The Best of Times...</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i><br/>A Fukufics (dotcom) Prodution</p><p><b>Part 7</b></p><p><i>"On difficult ground, press on";<br/>"On encircled ground, devise stratagems";<br/>"On death ground, fight"</i><br/>-Sun Tzu</p><p><i>"On fiancée ground, run. Run like hell."</i><br/>-Ranma Saotome</p><p><b>H</b>apposai rubbed the knot  on his head as the world slowly crept back into existence. Damn that  woman can sure dish out the punishment! But it had been worth it. The  perverted master pulled out a frilly bra from the folds of his tunic,  admiring the pink lacy garment. He replaced the bra and pulled out a  pair of similarly shaded panties. Very nice. And the woman herself  was <i>entirely</i> worthy of such garments. "I gotta remember  to reward the boy for picking a woman with such an outstanding taste  in underwear," he though merrily. "All my training must be  finally rubbing off on him... Now if only he would wear something  this nice," he lamented as he rubbed the panties against his  face.</p><p>But there was a problem.</p><p><i>Where the hell am I?</i></p><p>That was the question of  the moment as Happosai took stock of his surroundings, a dense forest  framed by an angry, overcast sky. It sure wasn't Nerima, Juuban or  even Tokyo for that matter. The old man considered himself the  worldly sort, but he was at a loss as to his immediate location.  Happosai recalled his final moments in the presence of the  green-haired beauty. Letsee, first there was the gropping- Happosai  paused with a whistful smile before moving on -then there was her  pathetic attempts to beat him off. After that, that annoying 'dead  scream' attack of hers. He rubbed his head reflexively, recalling the  headache it had produce. Then she waved that staff thing around, the  weird gates opened and... The flash of light was blinding? And now he  was here? Wherever here was again. Happosai scanned the horizon and  happened upon an unusual sight... four heads carved into the side of  a granite face... He was in... America? The hottie had transported him  to... Mount Rushmore!</p><p>Happosai boggled. Not  exactly the sort of retaliation he was expecting. Energy blast, sure.  Vacation? Um, ok... He oriented on the stone faces and was about  ready to begin his walk when a strong power signature closed rapidly  on his position. It took less than a second to assess its threat  potential and sidestep the inbound assault with apparent disinterest.</p><p>"GOTCHA YOU LITTLE  LEPRECH-!"</p><p>The spiky white-haired  youth shot out of the tree line, flew by the old pervert and plowed  face first into the ground. The kid hopped up from his crash landing,  coughing dust. He shook the impact off and faced the old gnome. "I'm  gonna get my wish if it's the last thing I do!"</p><p>Happosai arched an  eyebrow. Wish? Since when was I giving out wishes? The youth tensed  and this time Happi didn't bother to dodge. Instead, he brought his  pipe to bear and casually deflected the youth's attack, painfully  redirecting it into a nearby tree. "Tsk, tsk! You're gonna have to  do better than that, you little twerp!"</p><p>The Master took stock of  the young boy and his appearance, which was odd to say the least.  Well, not necessarily odd, just that he hadn't seen the style in  generations... Teen trend combined with.. Ninjitsu styling? In  America? The kid smacked his face a couple times to regain feeling  to it and faced the master once more. The upstart was as bad as  Ranma! But something was wrong here and he needed to find out what...</p><p>"Hold on, m'boy."</p><p>The youth paused  momentarily, staring at the old gnome. "You gonna give me my wish?"</p><p>Happosai scritched his  chin thoughtfully. "Possibly, possibly. What's you're name,  anyway?"</p><p>The boy considered him  warily. "Jiraiya. Who wants to know?"</p><p>"Name's Happosai m'boy, and I need  some information." The old Master smiled.</p><p>"I gotcher information... For a  wish." Happosai sighed. The boy had a one track mind.</p><p>"What makes you think I have a wish  to give?"</p><p>"Yer a leprechaun." The  spiky-haired boy rationalized with a shrug. "It's your job."</p><p>Happosai blinked. Didn't he need a pot  o' gold or something to do that? The Master brushed the youth's  misinformed mythology. "Ok, then, what's you're wish?"</p><p>Jiraiya's eyes glimmered. "Chicks!"</p><p>A smile crept across Happosai's face.  The kid may have the attitude of Ranma, but this one may have  <i>potential</i>. "I think we can come to some sort of an  arrangement. Where you from?"</p><p>"Konoha, of course."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"NOW WHERE AM I!"<p>Ryoga spun around with a panicked look  in his eyes. There was good reason for that look. One moment he had  been trudging through downtown Paris, staring at the ancient  pyramids, and the next he found himself... here. Wherever here was.  Blackness now surrounded the boy as he desperately sought a frame of  reference inside the inky void that had found him. And found it- A  huge pair of double doors, intricately carved in wood and stone.  Beside them was a tall, lithe woman with green hair streaming down  her back. Had Ryoga been any closer, he might have suffered a  nosebleed due to the extremely revealing costume she wore. Since she  appeared to be the only inhabitant in sight, the lost boy's next  course of action was obvious.</p><p>"Excuse me, Miss... Do you..."</p><p>Sensing his presence for  the first time, the woman spun around, the unrestrained breasts  within her fuku swaying with the motion. This was not to mention the  flash of forbidden naughty bits that were exposed as the skirt's hem  rose on the spin. "YOU!" Rage illuminated her eyes like  twin shafts of divine light.</p><p>?Me? Ryoga took a step  back reflexively while holding his nose that tried to explode  bloodily. Like Ranma, his senses concerning feminine fury were finely  honed... and like Ranma, he tried desperately not to look at the  jiggling mounds of female flesh before him.</p><p>"I know who sent you!" The woman  hissed and brought a heart tipped staff to bear on the lost boy.  "First those insane idiots, then the pervert troll and now an  assassination attempt!"</p><p>"Um, I don't-"</p><p>"I've seen hell because of you  people!"</p><p>Something tugged at the back of Ryoga's  psyche with those words, but he couldn't for the life of him remember  why. The answer came soon enough. "RYOGA HIBIKI, PREPARE TO DIE!"</p><p>Somehow, he  just <i>knew</i> this was all Ranma's fault.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Mamoru Chiba, otherwise known as Tuxedo  Kamen clutched his side with one arm while the other gratefully took  a bag of ice from a concerned looking Usagi Tsukino. The lumpy bag  was immediately applied to black eye. A sigh accompanied the action,  an action that only diminished the concern radiating from his girl  friend slightly. Each throb of pain forced him to recall the very,  very tragic tale that led to his beatdown at the hands of some guy  unimaginatively named 'Prince R'.<p>It was all going well until he had  attempted the punch, only to have it intercepted by the previously  unknown Prince. That's when it all went horribly wrong. Sure, the  arrival of the weird little youma had given the escalating conflict  pause, but only momentarily. The Prince himself seemed to take great  delight in watching the troll bounce around after Sailor Pluto and  relieve her of her undergarments, but that lasted only moment. Even  as Kamen himself stood distracted, the Prince whipped around and  completed the move Tux had started, nailing the only male Senshi with  vicious right cross that sent him into the nearest wall.</p><p>Quite literally <i>into</i> the nearest  wall.</p><p>Where Tuxedo Kamen's punch had been  borne of reflexive anger, Prince R's retaliations was calculated and  precise. The stranger's counter attack didn't allow Kamen any time to  formulate a battle plan as two more fists burned in through the dust  and pulverized his face, depriving him of any real sight. Next came  the machine gun to his gut, as if a thousand fists had decided they  would try to find a home inside his stomach. All at once. There was  enough coherent thought left in his adrenaline drenched brain to  unleash a veritable bouquet of high explosive roses, all of which  seemed to flow <i>around</i> the Prince as his attacker stepped  inside his non-existent guard one more time and unleashed a  devastating energy attack at point-blank range.</p><p>The next thing he knew he was trying to  sit up from within his very own smoldering crater... That was until  he felt the heat of a glowing blade at his throat. It looked like it  was carved from wood, but the glow had an undeniable lethality  emanating from it. Tuxedo Kamen dared not move. The next words he  heard beyond the pounding of his own heartbeat were burned in his  head...</p><p>"When next we meet, you best be a Man  among Men."</p><p>Chiba Mamoru stared at the crumpled  rose, then to the worried Usagi. Man among men. Did men use roses as  their main weapon? Did they stand at the back of the battle and snipe  their targets with those said roses? Mamoru looked at his future wife  once more and decide that changes needed to be made...</p><p>...After he could walk again.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>The tall woman's black fuku wavered  in the dawn breeze as she stared into the valley below. The horizon  glowed a pinkish hue, but the ageless Senshi's attentions were  focused elsewhere. Even as the rising sun banished the last vestiges  of night from the painted desert below, her vision focused on the  great walled city below. No force had assailed those walls in the  memory of any of its occupants, a fact that was about to change. Her  gave swept across the valley floor and onto the glinting cloud of  dust at the other end, slowly moving like a tide to wash over the  impregnable city. The fortress itself was still quiet. Sure, they  knew of the force arrayed against them, perhaps the largest in the  region, yet it didn't change the facts... The last army to attempt  such a feat had been dashed and bloodied against their walls. </i><p><i>The rays of dawn cut through the sky  and the army began to circle the fortress. Setsuna consulted her  internal clock. Right on time. There was little tactical value to the  maneuver, but its commander was obeying his instructions to the  letter. The army halted and slowly the cloud of dust they had created  blew across the horizon. </i></p><p><i>The Commander of the Israeli Army  pressed a horn to his lips and blew, its trumpeting echoing around  the canyon.</i></p><p>"<i>Dead Scream."</i></p><p><i>The battlements shattered in a flash  of light, creating an avalanche that began tearing chunks out of the  walls of wholesale, replacing the departing cloud of dust with one of  it's one. Within minutes, the breaches were substantial enough that  the foreign contingent could begin their assault, pouring through the  rubble and getting down to the business of sacking an impregnable  city.</i></p><p><i>The Senshi of Time nodded with  satisfaction. The Walls of Jericho had just come tumbling down.</i></p><p>Ranma tossed restlessly in his sleep...  The visions continued.</p><p><i>...She snuggled below the bearskin  covers and melted into the Scotsman's embrace, totally prepared to  make the most of what would be their last night together. He was, of  course, totally confident on the outcome of tomorrow's battle as any  noble Scotsman would be, but Setsuna Meiou was the mistress of time  and knew the future. She wanted desperately to stave off tomorrow,  but there was destiny to consider. After tonight, destiny would  snatch her lover from her arms. She mounted him once more and the two  rocked away in the night, hoping to drowned out the the reality that  she shouldn't even be there loving him, let alone expose herself to  world to such a degree.</i></p><p><i>But she was lonely... So lonely.</i></p><p><i>Morning came all too quickly and  Pluto watched as her lover mount his horse, clad in armor with a  traditional Scottish claymore strapped to his back. She stayed behind,  watching from the walls as his company departed down the cobblestone  path, young maidens in tow. Soon, her lover would be dead and  entangled in a quest of immortality that would only end in a pool of  blood and beheadings, which in turn would jeopardize her mission. Now  it was time to let him go from her arms and into the arms of destiny.</i></p><p><i>And once again she would be alone...</i></p><p>The pigtailed boy  shifted uncomfortably...</p><p><i>...A fine layer of dust drifted from  the ceiling as the bunker rocked again, the result of the dull thuds  shifting the earth above it. Everything occupying the ground above  the structure had been reduced to component rubble as tens of  thousands of pounds of ordinance were dropped on the city. Black clad  officers braced at their stations another five hundred pound bomb  detonated atop their position. Luckily there was three feet of rock  between them and the resultant detonation. No, it would take more  than a mere daylight bombing raid to shatter the last remnants of the  Third Reich's command structure... Or kill its leader.</i></p><p><i>Three hundred feet may have been  enough to protect against the allied attack, but it wasn't enough to  protect the various functionaries, generals and one Adolph Hitler  from The Mistress of Time itself. The air shuttered inside the bunker   and one of the more alert SS trench coats whirled around, bringing a  machine gun to bear on the fuku-clad Senshi. Setsuna looked upon him  with pity and willed time to slow down. Other guards reacted now, but  their movements were far too slow for the green-haired woman who was  now moving well in advance of real time. The heart-tipped staff she  bore flared with power and the next thing the bunker's occupants saw  was a soldier torn in half by a formless blur. The machine guns  cackled in the troopers futile attempts to his the blur, while the  officers began to pull their own sidearms in a futile effort to hit  something. In the end, both soldiers and officers did end up hitting  someone in the small confines of the bunker... Each other. Those that  weren't cut down by the blurring flare of power managed to hit their  own in the gun storm of flying bullets. Five minutes later, only one  man stood alive within the structure.</i></p><p>"<i>I told you I would be coming for  you if you continued this nonsense." Sailor Pluto's gaze bore into  the cowering mustachioed man. She took a step forward, and kicked a  bullet ridden chair from her path. The leader of the German war  machine nodded, his hand floated down to his belt, and the gun that  waited there. </i></p><p>"<i>And I told you what would happen  to you if I had to come for you." Another nod, this one accompanied  by the sound of pistol sliding out of its leather holster. The Senshi  twirled the Key of Time around menacingly and took another step  forward. There was no mistaking the lethal intent in her eyes... and  more. </i></p><p><i>The gun came up slowly...</i></p><p><i>...To his chin...</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i><br/>The gunshot jarred Ranma from his  fitful sleep and he bolted upright for the second time that night.  Tonight, he was alone save the disquieting memories that refused to  give him any measure of peace. As if the Sailors last stand at Mars  hadn't been bad enough... Just what the hell was this woman! Ranma  sent a hard fist into his futon and cursed silently.</p><p>He was in dire need of answers, and it  has time to get them.</p><p>Chibi Usa waved her daily farewell to  Usagi as she and the rest of the sailor parted company to engage in  the annoying practice known as school. Not that she really needed the  education, having already received a fine one in the future, just she  had so many friends there these days. The pink haired Senshi from the  future would have rather accompanied her mother and friends to <i>their</i>  school, but appearances need to be kept up, which meant faking it in  as a thirteen year old girl.</p><p>Book bag in hand, Chibi walked along  the sidewalk while admiring the beautiful day, when somebody stepped  out in front of her. Somebody she knew. Somebody with menacing blue  eyes and red locks of hair.</p><p>"BWAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH—MMmf!"</p><p>No sooner had the laughter erupted from  her lips, that a hand slapped across her mouth which in turn was  accompanied by a fairly annoyed look. The best Chibi could do was  blink in surprise before she was whisked into the redheads' arms and  suddenly found herself on a nearby rooftop seconds later...  Specifically, the very edge of the rooftop.</p><p>Chibi Usa glanced down at the ground  nervously. It didn't help she was a good eight stories up. "Um,  uh... What can I do for you, uh, Yumei?"</p><p>Ranma's eyes narrowed sharply on the  girl. "You know who I am."</p><p>"Uh.. heheh.. Yeah?"</p><p>The redhead stepped forward, glowering.  "My name."</p><p>Chibi Usa bit her lip nervously. "Ranma  Saotome?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Now how do you <i>know</i>  that name?"</p><p>"Um, I'm from the future?" The pink  haired girl produced a weak grin.</p><p>"Wrong answer." Ranma stuck out a  finger and poked Chibi, sending her off balance ever so slightly. Her  curls bounced around as she flailed to regain her balance on the  ledge. "You know stuff about me. <i>Specific</i> stuff. How?"</p><p>The girl regained her balance and gaped  at the redhead with wide eyes.  "Ican'tsaypleasedon'thurtmeIwasonlyhavingfunIcan'ttellyouyet!"</p><p>Ranma arched an eyebrow skeptically as  Chibi nearly lapsed into sobs. "Alright! Alright!" Damn my  weakness for womanly sobbing, Ranma thought with a sigh as Chibi  seemed to regain some semblance of composure. "Ok then... Lets talk  about the dreams I've been having."</p><p>"I really shouldn't..."</p><p><i>Poke.</i></p><p>"Eeeeek!" Chibi squealed as she  teetered on the ledge of the building once more.</p><p>Ranma withdrew the finger. "I <i>really</i>  want to know about the dreams." There was no mistaking the tone of  her voice. It wasn't a request she was making.</p><p>"Ok! Ok!" Chibi Usa was on the  verge of hyperventilation, her eyes fixed on the sidewalk below.  "It's the sword!"</p><p>Ranma blinked. "The sword?"</p><p>"You made a wish!" Small Lady  supplied quickly, fearing yet another poke. "The sword is  fulfilling that wish quite literally!"</p><p>Ranma considered this new information  and swore beneath her breath. "Dammit, I don't wanna know the life  and time of Setsuna Meiou! I don't want to know she kicked dictator  ass and I sure as hell don't want to know anything about her <i>love  life!</i>" The redhead shivered as she remembered the pleasure  quite vividly. It hadn't been with just one partner, and it sure as  hell wasn't helping that she was wearing her girl body at the moment.  One thing was for certain, however... After a few centuries of  practice, saying that she was <i>skilled</i> was an understatement.  Ranma growled and shook the memories away. She had been battling them  all morning, and fortunately for her, there was an equal number of  unpleasant memories to draw from... Like the unending, nearly  insurmountable loneliness of her post.</p><p>Ranma pulled her from the ledge,  bringing Chibi nose to nose. "More. I want more information about  what's happening."</p><p>"<i>I caaaaan't!</i>" Chibi nearly  whined, grating against Ranma's nerves and sympathy.</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Don't make me mess up the future,  please Uncle Ranma!" Now she <i>was</i> whining and Ranma let her  go on reflex. Damn the crying! "If I tell you too much, it'll  change things!"</p><p>The words 'Uncle Ranma' all but begged  to be explained, but Ranma passed on it in a sheer act of will power.  Her life was already bad enough. The last thing she wanted to do was  screw up the future as well. "Alright, alright. Stop yer cryin'. I  won't ask. Just stop teasin' me, kay?"</p><p>The tears evaporated instantly "Thank  you, Uncle!" Ranma endured the crushing hug, thankful that it  wasn't yet another fiancée glomp.</p><p>Ranma sighed. "Yeah, yeah. Off to  school with you." With that, she stepped off the roof and  disappeared from the ledge.</p><p>Chibi stood there for a moment,  recovering when sudden realization hit her...</p><p>...Like how  in the world was <i>she</i> suppose to get down?</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma gave himself a final check before  stepping onto the dojo property, ensuring there was no Sailor  paraphernalia remaining on his person before twisting the doorknob  and admitting himself back into the chaotic roller coaster known as  his regular life. The Saotome mentally congratulated himself. He had  gone an entire day without a Setsuna retaliatory event. Sure, there  was the standard fare with the fiancées that she had already  set in motion, but nothing new. The only thing he could glean from  this was that his own countermeasures were working as advertised.  Ranma was getting to know his opponent intimately- he cringed at the  sudden mental picture. <i>Bad </i>choice of wording -and knew how  smart she was. Set-<i>chan</i> had to know it by now which meant  things would likely be coming to a head sometime in the near future.<p>The martial artist smiled. He was  itching for a direct confrontation, as opposed to all this sneakin'  around. But by the time he was done with her, she would be more than  willing to stop sulking in the shadows. Ranma stepped into the house  and clutched the only remaining piece of Sailor paraphernalia on her person, a paper square.</p><p>"Hey Kas-chan! Catch!" Ranma  flipped the small square through the air at Kasumi, who had just set  down a dinner plate. A delicate arm snapped up, catching the the  square in midair, a testament to her father's original conditioning  of his daughters. Kasumi blinked and looked at her catch. Eyes  widened. A jaw dropped. Nabiki watched the reaction from across the  room and walked over to Ranma. Kasumi was still frozen, but a slight  'mewing' could be heard from her person.</p><p>"You broke my sister, Ranma."  Nabiki stared with increasing wonder at the reaction. Kasumi's eyes  were still locked unflinchingly on the square, mouth hanging open.  She stepped over to the entranced girl and looked at the find  herself. It was a photo with writing scrawled across it. "To  Kasumi, a sister of love and justice..." Nabiki blinked. "Love,  Sailor Moon?"</p><p>"OH MY!" Kasumi exclaimed in a most  un-Kasumi like squeal. She hopped around the table with more energy  than anybody had seen in years, and Ranma was crushed for the second  time that day. "Thank you, Ran-chan!" Two kisses landed  themselves on each of Ranma's cheeks and she pulled back to stare at  the glossy photo once more. "How in the world did you get this?"</p><p>"Oh, I have my secrets." Ranma  grinned and Nabiki was instantly at his side.</p><p>"Not from me, you don't." An hand  latched onto Ranma's arm and Nabiki proceeded to drag the pigtailed  boy upstairs and into her room. The door slammed shut and clicked  with the lock. "Spill it, Ranma. I want your source. Ranma?" It  took her a moment to notice that Ranma was now completely frozen his  reactions similar to Kasumi's as he took slow stock of Nabiki's room.  "What, haven't you ever seen of Prince R?"</p><p>Ranma had seen Prince R before. He had  just never seen Prince R in such... quantity. It was like he had  entered the twilight zone and that twilight zone was inhabited by  parodies of himself, who happened to be the boy-toy idol of Nabiki  Tendo. It was even creepier than Akane's room. "Uh, heh... You're a  Prince R fan?"</p><p>"No, I just have his pictures up her  because they match my bedsheets." Nabiki replied testily. "Unlike  you, he's suave and sophisticated... And a total hunk." Nabiki  smiled dreamily for a brief moment, before it was submerged below her  game face. "Where'd you get the autograph, Saotome?"</p><p>"Can't tell ya." His eyes flicked  from wall to wall.</p><p>"I'm sure you could if I told certain  people about your cross dressing habits." Nabiki countered,  applying pressure.</p><p>"Nope." Ranma crossed his arms,  affecting a cool demeanor. Truth was that he was sweating bullets on  the inside.</p><p>Nabiki cast a icy glare at him. It was  worth a try. Besides, everybody already knew she occasionally  blackmailed him into dress-up photo shoots anyway. It was a weak  threat at best. "Ok then, how about a deal then?"</p><p>"Deal?" Ranma asked warily, not all  that happy at the prospect of shaking hands with the devil's  accountant <i>again</i>.</p><p>"Sure." Nabiki smiled. A shark  couldn't have done better. "You can work off your debt by providing  me with autographs." Ranma winced. "And a bonus if you can get me  a Prince R autograph."</p><p>The  pigtailed boy rubbed his head and groaned. This was <i>not</i>  happening...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Yumei Ikari-Ranma smiled as she joined  her sisters in arms, the Sailor Senshi for the night meeting. Well,  most of them were sisters in arms. Haruka and Michiru weren't on  speaking terms with her... Or each other, ironically. Both women sat  on opposite sides of the room, glaring at each other. Yumei-Ranma  could barely suppress a smile. As amusing as the little cold war was,  there was something that amused her even more...<p>Setsuna Meiou sat off to the side,  trying her best to look calm and collected, which might have fooled  the average person. Unfortunately, she wasn't around average people  and Ranma noted the difference straight away. While her condition  wasn't nearly as bad as the Senshi's last meeting, the results of  Ranma's handiwork were showing in that her normally meticulously  styled green hair was frazzled. The bags under her eyes told the  story as well. Even her dress was more conservative in nature. Yumei  Ranma wasn't much better from Setsuna's attentions, but unlike her,  she floated on the high of payback as Ami called the meeting to  order.</p><p>The cobalt blue haired girl glanced  nervously at the Outers as she coughed politely, gaining everybody's  undivided attention. "I've been able to analyze the data from the  other Mercury Link." The Senshi watched intently as she set her  link to the Mercury super computer on room's central table. She  pressed a small button and the unit's holographic display came to  life, the air above it shimmering into the visage of a long wire  frame tube that flared open at both ends. "This is a model of the  wormhole the youma are using to gain access to our universe. The  different colors represent the numerous subspace bands the hole drops  through before exiting the other side."</p><p>"You would know all about the other  side, wouldn't you, <i>Haruka?</i>" Michiru's glare bore down on  the Senshi of Uranus who's eyes widened at the implication.</p><p>"I had nothing to do with that!"  Haruka protested. "<i>He</i> kissed <i>me!</i>"</p><p>Sailor Neptune crushed a pillow on the  couch she sat. "I didn't exactly see you resist, hmm?" Haruka's  jaw dropped.</p><p>"Now listen here!"</p><p>"He is quite a catch, '<i>Ruka-chan</i>."  Yumei added with a sweet smile, which earned a withering glare from  the Senshi. Not that she had time to follow up on it.</p><p>"Damn straight!" Minako piped up in  a mixture of awe and venom. "And damned if we'll let you take the  first straight hottie to come along in ages!" Some of the other  Inners nodded in agreement. Yumei's smile broadened.</p><p>"Yes, I'm sure he won't mind you  warming his bed tonight," Michiru stated with considerable frost.  "Because it sure won't be mine."</p><p>"Um, guys...?" Ami attempted to  break the angst. "About the wormhole?"</p><p>"It's obviously already been taken  care of." Michiru grumbled, staring straight at Haruka.</p><p>"WHAT WAS THAT!" Haruka stood up,  stalking over to the person who was rapidly becoming her  ex-girlfriend.</p><p>"I think you know exactly what-"</p><p>"<i>ENOUGH!</i>"</p><p>Setsuna's delicate china cup full of  tea hit the end table with enough force to put crack in it. "I have  had a <i>very bad</i> week and the last thing I need from you  <i>children</i> is to be bickering over that asinine pervert Prince  R, let alone watching you draw straws as to who gets to screw him!"</p><p>It was an even better emotional  breakdown than Yumei-Ranma ever could have hoped for in front of the  Senshi, and she desperately fought off the maniacal cackling that  would have normally accompanied her victory. As it was, she would  just have to settle for the stares and massive rounds of sweatdrops  rolling off the heads of the remaining Sailors. The Uranus-Neptune  cold war was icing on the cake.</p><p>"Uh, right." Ami commented,  scratching her head with embarrassment. "The different subspace  bands are what would prevented us from forcing our own entry into the  pocket universe, but now that we've been able to map out an open  portal, we can duplicate the route in ourselves."</p><p>"Ok, so we can get in now..." Usagi  observed, and Ranma followed up on her unspoken question.</p><p>"...but what's on the other side?"</p><p>"This." Ami tapped another key, the  rainbow colored tube was replaced by a large bubble with what  appeared to be a floating island taking up most of its volume. The  hologram rotated slowly and zoomed in on the island.</p><p>"An island?" Hotaru asked quietly,  to which Ami nodded.</p><p>"Exactly. The island itself takes up  roughly half the pocket universe, but that's not the interesting  part." Ami explained as the hologram continued to zoom. Seconds  later, structures could be seen on the island surface. At it's center  was a large spiky ball, whose incandescent rainbow coloration stood  out from the rest of the structures.</p><p>"Why aren't I gonna like the  interesting part?" Rei grumbled, and Setsuna stepped forward.</p><p>"Because what you are looking at is a  leftover." Pluto stated in a matter of fact tone, credibly covering  her earlier lapse.</p><p>"Leftover?" Makoto mimed  skeptically. Yumei and half the other sailors shared that skepticism.  Ranma had seen leftovers. Normally they weren't stored in a pocket  universe. Nor did they produce soul eating demons. Well, unless it  was Akane's cooking, the martial artist-turned-Senshi ammended. That  stuff was capable of anything.</p><p>"Leftovers." Setsuna confirmed.  "From the data we've obtained, this facility was built by our  dearly departed friend, Mistress 9." Her voice was heavily laden  with sarcasm.</p><p>"Gone, but not forgotten." Moon  commented dryly, and Ami continued for Pluto.</p><p>"It looks to be a giant manufacturing  complex," She reported as the hologram cruised above the surface of  the island, focusing on the buildings. "And from what has been  coming through the portholes, a giant youma manufacturing complex."</p><p>"You've got to be kidding..."Minako  breathed. Ami nodded.</p><p>"From what we've seen so far, I think  it's safe to assume their primary export is youma." Ami continued.  "Big youma, small youma, super youma..."</p><p>"Youma chicken, stir fried youma,  youma steak..." Yumei dead-panned, counting the dishes off on her  fingers.</p><p>"Uh, yeah. Pretty much." Ami said  with indifference, while the rest of the Senshi looked at the redhead  with slight incredulity. "Pluto and I pretty much agree it's still  in the first stage of activation, since the volume of demons coming  through has been steadily increasing."</p><p>"Nine is still alive?" Hotaru  whispered, to which Usagi put a comforting hand on her shoulder. The  Senshi of Saturn had good reason to be worried. Mistress 9 and in  turn Pharaoh 90 had made the girls' life a living hell.</p><p>"Not a chance." Pluto waved the  possibility aside. "Her time line is dead. Check it out myself.  This..." She gestured to the hologram. "is a contingency."</p><p>Ami picked up on the blank looks and  explained. "We believe that Mistress 9 had other projects in the  works should her primary plans using Pharaoh 90 fail. As it is, we  believe the complex was programmed to go live pending direct orders  or..."</p><p>"...her death." Haruka finished,  and both Ami and Setsuna nodded.</p><p>"Scorched earth." Yumei stated,  earning another round of nods.</p><p>"That's what we were thinking." Ami  replied.</p><p>"It gets worse."</p><p>All eyes shifted back to Setsuna.  "You've undoubtedly noticed this..." She gestured to the spiky  orb at the island's center. The mercury link interpreted the  movement, and zoomed in on the structure. "This just happens to be  the the power source of the pocket universe."</p><p>"We aren't going to like this, are  we?" Chibi Usa realized quietly, speaking for the first time.</p><p>"Unfortunately, no." Ami replied.  "It's a reactor. A reactor comprised of entirely pure heart  crystals."</p><p>The room let loose a collective gasp.  "How many...?" Usagi asked in a hushed whisper.</p><p>"Approximately eight thousand." Ami  replied in a similarly hushed voice.</p><p>Usagi's reaction was totally  unexpected. "WHERE THE <i>HELL</i> DID SHE GET THEM ALL!" The  future Princess was on her feet now, gaping at the hologram, then  turned to Setsuna. "I thought we were successful in preventing  these sort of incursions! What the hell have we been doing all this  time!"</p><p>Pluto understood her reaction all to  well. The loss of life that reactor represented was simply...  staggering. After all, you had to go through a lot of people to find  just <i>one</i> pure heart crystal, let alone..."I've done some...  research, you Highness." For some reason it seemed more appropriate  to call Usagi by her official title given the gravity of the  situation. "There was no way we could have covered all the bases.  Europe. The United States. South America. She was... careful."</p><p>The Princess continued staring. "So  what do we do about it...?" Rei asked in a hushed voice.</p><p>"Simple. We take it out."  Yumei-Ranma stated, an edge of steel accompanying her proclamation.  Even through the act she had been engaged in, there was no way she  could ignore her code, and mass murder demanded decisive action.</p><p>"Oh?" Haruka raised a skeptical  eyebrow. "And just how do you propose we do that? Can't exactly  glass the place from the inside, remember?"</p><p>"Actually, that's exactly what we  were planning on doing." Attention turned back to Ami. "Setsuna  managed to locate a stash of weaponry sealed in stasis... It's  contents include a few boxes of small arms, some power armor- weaker  than our suits -a few plasma artillery pieces and..." She paused,  her eyes shifting nervously, "...one tactical Elerium warhead."</p><p>"You mean we have a nuke?" Sailor  Venus squealed.</p><p>"Would have loved to have found that  sooner..." Moon growled, a sentiment most of the Senshi shared.  None of them could count the number of time when they would have  loved to have stuffed an original honest-to-god Moon Kingdom weapon  of mass destruction down one of their opponents throats. It would  have shortened so <i>many</i> disagreements.</p><p>"Well, we have it now." Pluto  pointed out, to which Usagi only nodded. "Still, it's not going to  be as easy as setting a timer and shoving it through the wormhole. If  we want to destroy everything, we have to destroy the PHC reactor."</p><p>"Which is protected by an <i>extremely</i>  powerful energy shield." Ami added and the Mercury link added a  transparent bubble around the reactor to the hologram. Some of her  audience groaned. She couldn't blame them. It was about to get even  better. "Which means... we have to go in, drop the shield, plant  the bomb and get out before the timer runs down. A Death Reborn at  point-blank range should do the trick."</p><p>"Through a universe full of  super-youma, right?" Michiru commented with something less than a  question.</p><p>"So where is this nuke?" Yumei  asked casually, setting her glass of tea on the table after a sip.</p><p>"Under the table." Pluto comment  just as casually, and Yumei's eyes widened. She pulled the cup back  <i>very</i> slowly. Ami stepped over and removed the Mercury link  from the surface, folding it up with a light click. She pulled the  lacy table clothe up and there it was, plain as day under the table's  glass surface. The weapon was about the size of a backpack and the  shape of a smooth silver oval.</p><p>"Smaller than I was expecting."  Haruka observed, and Ami nodded.</p><p>"That represents approximately one  gigaton's worth of fire-power." The cobalt haired Senshi  elaborated. "Twenty grams of Elerium 115, no radioactive  bi-products. It'll wipe out everything in the pocket universe,  provided we take the shield out first."</p><p>"I still can't believe the Moon  Kingdom had this sort of firepower..." Makoto breathed, eyeing the  silver weapon nervously.</p><p>"Had em and used em." Yumei-Ranma  interjected, drawing on Setsuna's memories of the Kingdom's last  stand involuntarily. "Got really nasty toward the end." Pluto  nodded with agreement as the exact same images were conjured within  her mind's eye as well. Apparently their memories were still more  complete than the rest of the Senshi. A look passed between the two,  and for the briefest moment, total comprehension existed between the  two women. They had both seen the bloody end of an era, and it hadn't  been a pleasant experience.</p><p>"How does it work?" Usagi asked,  leaning over the device.</p><p>"Voice activated." Ami replied.  "Simply feed it the armament codes and set a timer, that easy."  The girls looked at each other expectantly. After a minute, Ami spoke  first. "You <i>do</i> have the codes, don't you?"</p><p>Moon blinked. "Why would I have the  codes! I'm a princess, not a queen or a general!" She turned to  Pluto with the same expectant look.</p><p>"Don't look at me." She held up her  hands. "Not to worry, however. The cats will have them."</p><p>Yumei's eyes widened suddenly.  "Artemis, Luna...?" Usagi called, and the two cats padded into  the room. The redhead otherwise known as Sailor Nova watched the cats  cross the room, then pause. Their eyes turned on her.</p><p>"I don't believe we've been  introduced," The black cat said politely, hopping up on the table  in front Yumei. "I'm Luna and this is Artemis." The white cat  followed, inclining his head gracefully.</p><p>"Of course, we know who you are."  Artemis stated, smiling. "We were under the impression that none of  the Queen's Own made it forward. Do you remember us?"</p><p>Oh, Yumei-Ranma remembered them  alright. She only had Setsuna's memories stuffed into her head  sideways, and with them, the knowledge of Queen Serenity's advisers.  There was, of course, only one problem with this equation. They were  <i>cat</i> advisers. Anybody who knew Ranma Saotome could have  predicted her next response with absolute clarity.</p><p>Yumei sat frozen, fear pooling in her  eyes. "Maybe she <i>doesn't</i> remember us..." Luna commented,  leaning forward with interest. Another minute of silence ground by.</p><p>"Um, Yumei?" Usagi nudged her body  guard, slightly concerned by her frozen state. She was looking for a  reaction, and unfortunately got one.</p><p>"Cu...Cu...Cu..." Yumei began to  stutter, eyes locked onto the felines.</p><p>"Starts with a 'C'?" Makoto queried  cheerfully.</p><p>"How many vowels?" Rei inquired.</p><p>"Is it bigger than a pound of  butter?" Minako asked, and suddenly found all eyes on her. "What?"</p><p>All eyes, except Yumei's, of course.  "Cu... Cu... CATS!" She burst and attention promptly returned to  her as she backed up on to the couch she had sat at. Her tea cup fell  to the floor and both felines winced at the proclamation. "<i>Talking  Cats!</i>" The redhead amended in horror, as if it were somehow  relevant to the terror coursing through her brain.</p><p>"Uh, yes?" Luna confirmed the fact  that they were indeed cats.</p><p>"DAMN CATS!" Ranma bolted upright  as some unseen gears shifted in her brain, diluting the mixture of  fear with a healthy dose of hate. The cats in question were now  backing up.</p><p>"You don't suppose she's still angry  about that prank we pulled on the guards that night when..."  Artemis commented as he slowly backed away.</p><p>Luna's whiskers twitched as she  mirrored his movements. "God, I hope not..."</p><p>The fact that they were talking cats  was perhapses the only thing that kept Ranma rooted in place and not  running for the hills. Unfortunately, the irrational fear was quickly  being replaced by another emotion altogether as she stepped of the  couch, stalking the retreating advisers. "I HATE cats!" The other  Senshi began to back away as the redhead's temper spiraled out of  control. They had all seen what she could do and weren't looking for  any piece of it.</p><p>All but two of them.</p><p>Moon attached a light hand onto Yumei's  shoulder in an attempt to restrain her friend. "Um, they're Moon  Kingdom advisers, Yumei-chan! They're nice, honest!"</p><p>Yumei-Ranma turned on Usagi suddenly,  and the blond found her captured in the redhead's incandescent gaze.  "No they're not! They're CATS!" She hissed and Usagi's eyes  widened. "They say they're your friends, but they're not! One  minute you're petting them and the next you'll find yourself wrapped  in fish sausage and served up for dinner!"</p><p>"Wrapped in..." Setsuna's attention  suddenly focused.</p><p>"Scheming, maniacal, diabolical  CATS!" Ranma confirmed, whipping back around to the cats in  question. The ghostly blue visages of ki blades formed along Yumei's  knuckles, rippling to life. "Ain't no cats gonna serve me for  dinner again!"</p><p>"What the hell are those!" Haruka  stared incredulously at the energy weapons forming at the girl's  hands.</p><p>"Usagi, step away from her."  Setsuna ordered and transformed without the usual stylistic flare.  The action surprised the princess enough that she did step away from  the redhead, who continued to advance on Artemis and Luna.</p><p>Makoto interposed herself between Yumei  and the cornered cats. "Now look, Yumei, i'm not so sure..."</p><p>"<i>Dead Scream."</i></p><p>The line of energy flashed across the  room and hit Yumei dead on, blowing her into and through several  interior walls before exiting the building entirely. The other girls  simply stared in disbelief as Sailor Pluto completed the attack and  calmly stepped through the smoldering hole she had just created and  into the outside air. Usagi was right on her heels.</p><p>"Why in the world did you do <i>that?</i>"  She yelled, unable to believe such an escalation had taken place.  Sure, Yumei could rub people the wrong way, but... "I'm sure we  could have-"</p><p>"'Yumei' is not who she seems."  Pluto stated with a demeanor that hovered just above sub-zero  temperatures. She stepped over the burning remains of a couch and  into the outside air. A trench smoking rubble indicated the redhead's  departure vector. "He's been playing us all this time!"</p><p>"He?" The rest of the Senshi were  recovering from the sudden shock, filtering outside to watch the  impending fight. Ami's face was similar to that of Moon's. "What  are you talking about! You didn't have to-"</p><p>Pluto paused in her advance down the  smoldering trench. "Yumei Ikari is actually Ranma Saotome, one of  the largest chaos generators I have ever encountered." She  explained without turning around. The Senshi scanned the trench for  her victim. "If Crystal Tokyo is to survive, he's going to have to  be eliminated."</p><p>Usagi's thought process was suddenly  racing, Yumei's warning jumping like lightening through her brain.  "But can't we-"</p><p>"No." Setsuna replied tersely,  cutting off the princess mid-sentence. "You don't realize how  dangerous this person is. We can't risk having a loose cannon like  him running around."</p><p>"And who made you judge, jury and  executioner again?" A female voice asked from the smoke. A glowing  redhead stepped out of the charred, black trench, ready for war.</p><p>"<i>Queen Serenity."</i> Setsuna  replied, her voice devoid of emotion.</p><p>"Oh that's right, Miss 'fifth in line  to the throne of Pluto'" Ranma commented sarcastically, wiping a  trickle of blood from her lip. "But I don't recall mass murder  being part of her agenda."</p><p>Pluto blinked. The girl shouldn't have  known that.</p><p>"What?" Usagi yelped in horror.  Her eyes went from Pluto to Ranma and back.</p><p>"I've only done whatever was  necessary to protect Crystal Tokyo." Sailor Pluto replied. "You,  on the other hand, are not only a force that may destroy it, but  you've betrayed every person here."</p><p>Moon was beginning to feel like her  head was on a swivel as she stared back at Ranma now. "Is that  true?"</p><p>Ranma's glow faded slightly. "Yeah it  is. Ya deserve the truth I guess." The redhead retrieved her  thermos from weapons space and uncapped it. "My real name is Ranma  Saotome, heir to the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts." As if  to punctuated the fact, Ranma upturned the thermos over her head and  produced a black-haired boy with blue eyes.</p><p>"You've gotta be kidding..." Rei  breathed softly. "He's a hunk!"</p><p>Makoto blinked. "He's a Starlight?"</p><p>"He's Prince R!" Minako proclaimed,  stars in her eyes.</p><p>"He's Prince R!" Michiru and  Haruka gasped simultaneously.</p><p>"Oh God, my head hurts." Ami moaned  while Chibi unsuccessfully suppressed a giggle.</p><p>"But... Why?" Usagi asked as the  group's sudden realizations began to dog pile her.</p><p>"Ask her why." The glow around the  now male Ranma increased in intensity. "Ask her why she's made the  last three years of my life a living hell. Ask her <i>why</i> I had  to put us through all this just force a confrontation!"</p><p>"Because you'll destroy everything I  worked so damn hard for!" Setsuna's screamed as she blew her top.  "DEAD SCREAM!"</p><p>This time Ranma was ready for it, and  slid out sideways to avoid the lethal ray of energy. If he hadn't  been moving so fast, the Sailors would have notice a hard-edged  smile. Finally, it was time to end this farce and her meddling. Ranma  cut in and delivered three hard kicks to Setsuna's midsection,  followed by a roundhouse to the head. The Senshi's fuku armor did  it's job and absorbed most of the impact before the ki blast hit  seconds later at point blank range.</p><p>"<i>Möko  Takabisha!" </i></p><p>The blast impacted Setsuna hard,  blasting her back into the section of temple they had just exited.  Like Ranma before, she tore a hole through the walls and suddenly  found herself in the shrine courtyard. Sailor Pluto shook it off and  looked up just in time to find Ranma airborne above, twisting into  what was sure to be devastating combo.</p><p>"Space Sword Blaster!" Ranma had  just enough time to perform an aerial twist and avoid the inbound  blade of light that sliced past him. He landed off target and Setsuna  rolled out, recovering into a guarded stance beside a transformed  Sailor Uranus.</p><p>"Neptune planet power, make up!"  Michiru's sea green hair floated in the air as her transformation  processed. The light show faded and Sailor Neptune stepped up beside  Pluto and Uranus. "I think a little bit of payback is in order,  don't you, hun?"</p><p>"Definitely." Sailor Uranus  growled. The joke had been on them, and they <i>weren't</i> happy  campers at the moment.</p><p>"Three against one!" Minako whined  as the trio readied their next assault. "I'm won't let you hurt the  cutie! Venus power, <i>make up!</i>"</p><p>"Same here!" Rei yelled. "Mars  power, make up!"</p><p>A sweat drop rolled off the side of  Ranma's head as the two Inners took up flanking positions at her  back.</p><p>"You've got to be kidding..." Ami  groaned, rubbing her temples once more.</p><p>"Do something, Moon!" Hotaru called  to the blond, who stood dumbfounded with Makoto. Chibi Usa cackled  from the sidelines.</p><p>Ranma glanced at his escort. "No  offense, but this is between me and her." Pluto's gaze narrowed on  the martial artist, and she nodded at her Outers, who in turn took a  step back. This was a private vendetta.</p><p>"<i>Chronos Typhoon!" </i>The Time Key twirled in her hands and a  gust of lethal wind blew forth as Setsuna took the offensive. Ranma  was already in the air and over the attack, twisting into another  devastating aerial combo that promised to hurt if it connected.  Setsuna wasn't about to let that happen. She concentrated and local  time slowed around her. She side-stepped his landing and renewed her  own offensive with the staff, whipping it through a graceful attack  that could only be obtain through centuries of practice. To everybody  else, the Senshi seemed to suddenly speed up and to anybody else, the  technique might have proved decisive. To Ranma Saotome, however, she  was finally a challenge. The pigtailed boy avoided a few more arcs  when suddenly Setsuna's staff bit hard against a solid object, sparks  shattering down it's length.</p><p>The the Staff of Time just met the Staff of Ascension.</p><p>Pluto pulled back suddenly in the face of the lethal new threat.  "Forgot about this, huh?" Ranma smirked, twirling his own weapon  around now. The two circled one another menacingly."Stop screwin'  with my life and you can walk away with all yer bones unbroken."</p><p>"You're the one who won't be walking away, Saotome." Setsuna  growled and dropped back into a fighting stance.</p><p>"ENOUGH!"</p><p>Ranma and Setsuna paused in their initial lunge as the enraged female  voice rolled over them, both removing their eyes from one another  ever so carefully to find the source. Across from them stood Sailor  Moon, fully transformed and totally pissed. Silver Millennium power  washed over both combatants, ensuring their undivided attention.</p><p>"Sailor Pluto, you will stop this nonsense right now!" The  furious girl ordered in a tone that could not dare be disputed and it  was one of those rare moments when there was no question as to whose  daughter she was. "I don't know what all you've been doing to keep  Crystal Tokyo going, but it doesn't sound befitting a soldier of love  and justice! From now on, any decisions you make go through <i>me</i>  first, <i>do you understand!</i>" Setsuna nodded involuntarily.  "And as for you, Yumei, Ranma or whatever your name is... I don't  appreciate being deceived and manipulated!" Ranma began to protest  weakly only to cut off. "No, hush! Now after what we've been  through, I have to wonder if you really are our ally!" The  smoldering glare that swept across their persons would have been  enough to reduce them to cinders outright if it had actual substance.  "Now both of you will stop fighting and apologize to each other!"</p><p>They both stared at Moon in disbelief.</p><p>"Apologize..?" Setsuna gasped.</p><p>"To her!" Ranma twitched.</p><p>"NOW!" Sailor Moon growled, a slight glow of menacing power  accompanying the order.</p><p>Ranma looked at the black fuku clad women standing across from him.  He ground his teeth down. "Sorry."</p><p>"Yeah. Sorry." Pluto replied, her tone equally forced. Neither of  their faces said they were sorry.</p><p>"Better." Moon frowned. "I'll deal with you both<i> later</i>."  both Setsuna and Ranma shivered at the thought. The bumbling blond  apparently could be quite the disaplinarian when nessisary. "For  now, we have better things to fight than each other."</p><p>"Um, about that..." Ami said tentatively, not exactly eager to  earn the ire of her Princess at the moment.</p><p>"Hmm?" Usagi arched an eyebrow.</p><p>"The Mercury Computer is saying that at our current force levels,  we only have a 32.8 percent chance of success." She replied softly.</p><p>"Damn." Usagi whispered. It was a sentiment shared by everybody  present. "Not that we have much of a choice."</p><p>Ranma stared at the group in front of him. In the past month he had  infiltrated them, manipulated them and outright lied to them, all in  the name of payback. Yet somehow they had become his friends, he  realized. I may not be Sailor Nova anymore, Ranma thought to himself,  but that doesn't really change a thing. There was his code as a  martial artist to consider and he'd be damned if he'd let them go in  alone, screw the odds.</p><p>"How long until we go?"</p><p>A small smile crept to Usagi's face. All eyes turned on Ami. "I can  have the exact path into the pocket universe nailed down within the  week, say, Friday."</p><p>Ranma nodded and hopped up to the shrine's rooftop. "Where you  going?" Pluto asked, a small measure of hostility leaking into her  voice.</p><p>The martial artist turned his back on the Senshi below. "To call in  some favors."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Friday morning. The dew was still  standing on the grass as the Senshi waited for their adopted twelth  team member. The suns' rays crept over the shrine walls while monks  went about their business, all but oblivious to the Sailor's  business.<p>"He ditched us." Haruka stated in a  grumpy tone. "Might as well leave without him."</p><p>"Ranma will be here." Pluto  replied, earning her a skeptical look. "I may not like him, but if  there is one thing I do know about him, it's that he always keeps his  word. It's one of the things that makes Saotome so damn dangerous."</p><p>"Damn right."</p><p>The  new voice drew the sailors  attention, and they found its owner balanced lightly on the outer  shrine wall, wielding the Staff of Ascension. Beside Ranma was a boy  of approximately the same type, clad in a faded yellow tunic and  matching tiger striped bandanna. To his left, an ancient looking  woman balanced on a staff who nodded graciously at the Senshi,  flanked by a younger woman and her scimitar. Her long purple hair  floated in the morning in the breeze. On the elders opposite side was  a white robed young man sporting coke bottle thick glasses. To  Ranma's left stood a girl with long, dark pink hair who "meowed" a  greeting. The blue and white school uniform and fangs were her  distinctive features.</p><p>"Who the hell are they?" Michiru  wondered somewhat sarcastically. An "Oh shit" from Pluto was her  reply.</p><p>"Ranma?" Moon left the question  hand, earning her a lopsided grin.</p><p>"Ladies,  I'd like to present to you the Nerima Wrecking Crew."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Authors notes;</b><p>As you can see, I've been steadily  winding up the tension here as more plot comes to bear.
