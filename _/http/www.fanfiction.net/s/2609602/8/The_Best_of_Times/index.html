</div><p><b>The Best of Times...</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i><br/>A fukufics (dotcom) production</p><p><b>Part 8</b></p><p>"<b>G</b>ot  it!" Kyouko exclaimed, adjusting the display at her gunner's  position behind the pilot. "Massive energy reading at one-one-five  mark oh-eight-three, ten kilometers!"</p><p>The proclamation caused the pilot to  produce a feral grin as she fingered the red flight helmet, flipping  a shaded visor down. Arisa pulled the stick around and Poison Nine  slewed through the morning sky as its nose found the new vector. "How  many we got, Kyo-chan?"</p><p>The blond studdied her panel carefully.  "The signature is a mess... We're gonna have to get closer."</p><p>Arisa nodded. "Right. Make the call."</p><p>"Poison Nine to Backstop, targets  acquired," The gunner keyed her mic, opening a channel back to  base. "Requesting a go-nogo."</p><p>"Ryu-chan?"  The simple question crackled back in the form of a hard-edged female  voice.</p><p>"Negative,  still with Doctor Natsume." Kyouko confirmed.</p><p>"Go."</p><p>"Go confirmed." The blond repeated,  flipping down her own visor. "I have the energy reading at five  miles, ECM and counter-measures coming online."</p><p>Arisa stared through her heads up  display as the target was illuminated through it. "Got it. Weapons  hot, safeties disengaged." She replied, flipping a number of  switches along her own panels. Her feral smile diminished slightly,  and she gave the radar display a good thump. "Are you getting  interference back there? Attack radar seems a bit jumpy..."</p><p>"Yeah, target area is saturated with  it." Arisa's gunner frowned. "Switching to optics." Kyouko  thumbed a small joystick, and the optics array on Nine's nose came to  life orienting itself in the target's general direction. "That's  the stuff!" She grinned as one cat-girl came into focus, and beside  her, the cat-boy. "Designating primary target NK1124."</p><p>The pilot stared at  her display and tapped the cat-girl's head. "You're mine now,  bitch!" Arisa flipped the guard up on her index trigger and  selected the nose mounted plasma cannon with her thumb. The  tri-barrelled cannon whirrled to life, locking onto the camera's  imagery.</p><p>"What the HELL is  THAT?" Kyouko called out in a paniced tone and Arisa's eyes  frantically searched the horizon. The damn gun ship was in full  stealth mode. They shouldn't be under fire this soon- Then she saw  it, a distorted pillar of energy that began to rapidly consume the  strike zone. The brunette watched in horror as the cat-girl's friends  jumped away and disappeared into the shimmering distortion. "Lost  readings on the secondary targets!"</p><p>"NO!" Arisa  yelled as her objectives began to disappear before her very eyes. All  that remained on her screen was the cat-girl, who seemed to shrug  before jumping into the vortex herself. "You're <i>not</i> getting  away this time!"</p><p>"Ris-chan, we  don't even know what that is!"</p><p>"AAAAHHHHAAAaaaARRR!"  Arisa let loose a primal scream, and shoved the throttle to the  stops. The gunship's two shoulder slung turbofans whined painfully as  they tilted forward into their maximum angle of attack. The nose  dropped sharply and the gunship dove into the evaporating event  horizon.</p><p>Kyouko keyed the  mic in panic. "Backstop, this is Poison 9! We are engaging the  target!" Her eyes widened as the ground grew at an insane rate.  "Repeat, this is Poison 9, <i>we are going in!"</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>Sailor Pluto took  an involuntary step back as her eyes took in the figures on the wall  and what they represented. Of course, there was Ranma Saotome. She  knew he of all people would be here. Ranma had been her pet project  for the last few years and knew his intentions beyond a shadow of a  doubt. But as had become customary lately, he continued to be an  unending source of surprises.</p><p>"So, we meet at  last, Guardian Pluto." The Senshi eyed the shriveled old woman  balanced on the cane above her and shivered. Like Ranma himself, she  knew everybody on the wall, if only because she had bound them all  together like some mis-woven tapestry. "We have... <i>things</i> to  discuss." ...And so did the two teens at her side, which was  apparent through the intensity of their gazes on her person.</p><p>"So  <i>many</i> things." The  banndanna'd boy next to Ranma growled and blushed at the same  time, as he recalled the severe beating and the free show he'd  received... . It hadn't helped her  case when Ranma informed the Ryoga that Pluto was the main reason he  had been getting lost as of late.</p><p>"Reow." That  came from the cat girl, eliciting another shiver from both Setsuna  and Ranma. It wasn't a happy sound, as Nuku Nuku had picked up on the  mood of her future husband and focused her ire on the woman that  displeased him.</p><p>"Setsuna, what  have you been up to?" Sailor Moon arched a dangerous eyebrow upon  seeing the displeasure of complete strangers focused on the Senshi of  Time. While she wasn't completely happy with the newcomers joining  her team, she knew any little bit would help their already slim odds.</p><p>A tiny bead of  sweat rolled from the Senshi's forehead.</p><p>"We'll settle up  later." Ranma stated flatly as the group stared Setsuna Meiou down.  He smiled inwardly. Those memories were actually turning out to be  good for something other than screwing with is gender sense. "We're  here to do a job."</p><p>"Indeed." The  Amazon matriarch agreed. "Much as I would like to... <i>settle up</i>,  the threat as described is too large to ignore." Even Ryoga nodded  with her statement.</p><p>Sailor Mercury  handed Pluto the Mercury link on cue. "It's all there. If you can  cut us a time-space hole down that route, we should exit within ten  kilometers of the reactor." The Mistress of Time studied the data  from the link then handed it back with a nod.</p><p>"Ten kilometers  isn't exactly a Sunday stroll, you know." Sailor Neptune noted.</p><p>"Through a  universe full of super youma." Haruka add darkly.</p><p>"Silly monsters  no match for Amazon warrior." Shampoo sniffed with unshakable  confidence. "Scared girl stay back if want."</p><p>"WHAT!" Sailor  Uranus' eyes widened at the unexpected insult.</p><p>"Either way,"  Ami stepped in before the conflict could escalate, "It's as close  as I can get us."</p><p>"Then lets be  about it." Moon stated firmly and looked Ranma square in the eye.  "Well?"</p><p>"Well what?"</p><p>"Well, if I'm  going to be wading waist deep in youma, I expect my body guard to be  there as well." Usagi stated, folding her arms across her  fuku-ribboned chest.</p><p>Ranma blinked. "Uh  yeah, well, about that..."</p><p>Sailor Moon  frowned. "Or were you just playing my friendship the entire time as  well?" Ranma sighed at the hole he'd dug himself, then looked at  Pluto, whose eyes still flicked from him to his new team members  nervously. Okay, so it had been worth it. He shrugged mentally. Nova  might as well go out with a bang, right?</p><p>"Nova Power, <i>Make  Up!</i>" The flash of light washed over Ranma and the fuku was in  place, Staff of Ascension deployed. After weeks playing the part, her  hand pulled out the pigtail on reflex, unbinding her bright red hair.  Sailor Nova was back in action.</p><p>"Oh, Son in-law, this is priceless!" The Elder snickered from the  wall and Ranma scowled. Mousse's jaw was hanging and Shampoo blinked  curiously. Nuku nuku shared the look. The resemblance was uncanny, in  fact.</p><p>"When  Airen join Senshi?" She asked innocently, then a smile crawled  across her face. "Ranma make too-too good soldier of love and  justice. Maybe Shampoo help on the love part after all over  with this, yes? "</p><p>"Ranma-husband  girl-cat now?"</p><p>"My, that's a  nice fuku, Ranma." Ryoga's humor-laden tone prodded the newly  transformed Senshi. "Should I just put you out of your misery now?"  Knuckles cracked, as if to emphasize the question.</p><p>Sailor Nova simply  shook her head. She'd been doing this for nearly three weeks now and  the taunting didn't goad her as it would have before. "Laugh it  up, all yas." Then she turned to Moon. "Ready when you are."</p><p>Usagi smiled and  the rest of the Sailors seemed a bit more at easy with the familiar  form by her side. "Pluto?" Sailor Pluto nodded and the team felt  a large spike of power. The Senshi of Time began to glow, and before  them, reality began to ripple and shimmer. The air around them  shuddered, and the distortion grew, taking up a fair portion of the  shrine's courtyard. The shimmering crawled skyward and stopped,  seeming to solidify as it did so. The glow around Pluto faded.</p><p>"Gate's up."  She stated without flourish. "Last chance to back out." Even  through the statement was meant for the entire team, she cast a hard  glare at Ranma specifically.</p><p>"Thought you'd  have learned by now." Nova replied to the challenge with ice.  "Ranma Saotome <i>never loses.</i>" With that, she stepped into  the portal and vanished. Setsuna growled and rushed in behind her.  One by one the Senshi-NWC combined swirled and vanished, until only  Nuku Nuku remained. She too shrugged and hopped in.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sailor Nova landed  in a guarded stance, her senses complaining as the distorted reality  cleared from her person. She shook her head and another screeching of  twisting metal erupted above her as Pluto landed gracefully beside  her, followed closely by Moon and the rest of their strike team. Nova  blinked and her words were preempted by Pluto's own observation.<p>"Oh shit."</p><p>It was the second  rude surprise she had encountered today, this one being by far the  worst. Even as Nuku cleared the gateway, Setsuna took in the view in  front of her... They now stood on a dusty plain and in the distance  was the glimmering sphere that was their objective, whose brilliance  provided the sole illumination the pocket universe would see. Around  it, stood the vast sprawl of the youma manufacturing facility, framed  by the dim chaotic rainbow that comprised what could loosely be  termed as "sky." Pluto knew that it wasn't sky in the traditional  sense, but the boundaries of the void, literally the ends of this  small universe. But none of that was what prompted the "oh shit".  That came from the fact that they were literally surrounded by youma  of all sizes, formed up into ranks.</p><p>"There must be  thousands!" Usagi exclaimed, recovering from the wormhole transit.</p><p>"The forces  arrayed against Earth is indeed formidable" Cologne observed  with gravity, pogo'ing up beside Moon.</p><p>"I've got exactly  eleven thousand four hundred and fifty two in sensor range at the  moment." Mercury reported as she consulted her link. "Luckily,  they all appear to be in standby. Don't touch any-"</p><p><i>WhoooOOOOOOSH!</i></p><p>Half the team  reflexively ducked as a sudden gust of wind blew across them, the  result of a sleek looking aircraft suddenly jumping out of the  wormhole gate and gaining altitude.</p><p>"What the HELL is  that!" Ryoga hollered above the din of engine noise. Ranma  frowned. She recognized the design, as did Nuku, who hissed.</p><p>"You've got to be  kid-" Ranma's complaint was cut off by Hotaru, whose voice  quavered with a measure of fear.</p><p>"Um guys..."</p><p>"<i>ROOORoooWL!"</i></p><p>"I don't think  they're in standby anymore." She finished as the obvious became  painfully apparent. Growls could be heard from every angle and the  Senshi-NWC strike team arrayed itself into a circle. The ranks of  youma attention turned inward, finding life where it didn't belong.  Most of the monsters were pinkish and somewhat female-looking, but  all of them looked to have been beat with the ugly stick at some  point during their creation. Big ones, small ones...</p><p>"<b>RAAARRRAARRR!"</b></p><p>The sound seemed to  be a decisive one and the youma lines charged into the life that  shouldn't have been. The power levels of fourteen humans spiked  abruptly and the time for talk was over.</p><p>"Here they come!"  Moon yelled and the team braced against the oncoming horde.</p><p>The  first youma jumped in, claws aimed to eviscerate Sailor Nova's  throat. The Staff of Ascention came up and it's chest met a half  moon blade. The crescent bit  into the youma's torso and it instantly crystallized into a solid  block of ice. Nova carried the momentum through and it hit the  ground, shattering the beast in half. The strike team was now  decisively engaged as youma attempted to come hand to hand all along  their lines, only to meet lethal resistance.</p><p>"<i>Bakusai  Tenkestsu!</i>" Rock  shattered at Ryoga's feet as his breaking point technique ripped into  a group of five, showering them with what amounted to high speed  granite fragmentation that shredded anything in its path. The youma  fell, or rather denigrated as the fight carried on to either side.  Sailor Venus' Love Me Chain slashed forth, removing another four  youma from his flank. She had just enough time to give the Lost Boy a  wink before being reengaged. Pluto dropped into compressed  time as her own heart-tipped staff ripped through the demonic ranks  pressing her own front. The staff cut through the air and a Chronos  Typhoon surrounded her, clearing the immediate area. It gave her time  to watch Mercury dodge a pair of claws and perforate her own  attackers with a freezing mist. Anything that didn't crumble under  it's own icey weight was shattered in the overpressure created by  Sailor Jupiter's own Sparkling Wide Pressure attack,  which vaporized her own targets in their entirety.</p><p>Cologne  took the offensive brunt on the circle's opposite flank, the ancient  staff she had wielded for so long blurring through the lethal  chestnut technique. Shampoo's scimitar  flashed in close beside her as the purple haired amazon covered her  back with a grace matched only by Saotome herself. The trio was  rounded out by Mousse who had come loaded to bear. Edged weaponry  flew from his oversize sleeves, providing the entire circle with an  exotic form of suppressive fire. Three more Youma fell as the Elder's  staff tip punched through skulls, hearts and other vital organs while  Shampoo chopped another two attempting to cleave her great  grandmother's back.</p><p>"<i>Silence  Glaive Surprise!"</i></p><p>Five square blocks of youma instantly vaporized as Sailor Saturn  brought her Silence Glaive down, the resulting plume of fire roaring  up into the fractal dusk sky. Even as it did, another roar was heard  off to the left and a giant youma seemed to spring up from the earth.  It crawled up from the ground on four legs, rearing it's massive  horns and gaping jaws. Charred pink scales covered the beast and it  lurched forward.</p><p>Three team members spotted the threat and reacted simultaneously. It  just so happened that all three had the same weapon of choice to use  in dispatching the charging demon. Sailor Nova disengaged from the  front lines and reversed the her staff, snapping the ringed edge at  her new target. Ryoga Hibiki also noticed the rampaging youma,  sliding the super dense umbrella off his back and popping it open.  With a might heave, the super dense bamboo scythe flew skyward.  Finally, Sailor Moon whirled around as the new combatant surfaced, and  she pulled the gold shining tiara off her head.</p><p>"<i>Moon  Tiara Action!"</i> The call rang  out and all three members attack flew out at once. Nova's Kinjakan  ring blazed on fire through the left arc while Ryoga's umbrella cut  right. The glowing tiara blew down the center and all three weapons  converged simultaneously, chopping into the beast from three separate  angles. Ranma's flaming disk carved through the giant youma's torso  diagonally, while Ryoga's umbrella virtually gutted the demon's  midsection. Moon's Tiara all but decapitated the pink monstrosity  outright. The weapons returned on separate arcs to their owners, who  shared a look as the beast literally fell apart at the seams.</p><p>But as spectacular as it was... "We're not making any headway  here!" Pluto's voice called out and the dilemma resonated within  Usagi. The fact was they <i>were</i> making headway, but that headway  against the horde was at molasses speeds, at best. They needed a  breakout and they need one now.</p><p>It just so happened somebody heard there plea.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Poison Nine to Backstop, come in Backstop..." Static greeted  Kyouko's transmission. "Nothing but dead air, Ris-chan."<p>"So what the hell is happening down there?" Arisa stared at the  display slaved to the nose camera, where a small war raged two  hundred feet below. The blond in the gunners seat pushed her face  against the armored glass canopy.</p><p>"Fighting an army of zombies?" She theorized as a fiery plum  floated skyward.</p><p>"An army of darkness, more like it." The pilot commented as she  zoomed the camera in on one of the larger monsters, which was  promptly dissected by three guided weapons. "Got some serious  firepower down there too." Arisa slewed the camera right and found  her dark pink-haired target, ripping one of the demon looking things  apart with her bare-hands. Dammit, she really didn't want to help  cat-girl, especially when it was the perfect opportunity to ace the  distracted android. She thumbed the optics joystick from cat-girl to  monster and back, chewing her lips with indecision.</p><p>"Looks like they're moving toward that giant crystal thing."  Kyouko observed, and Arisa came to a decision. Unless they wanted to  be stuck here, cat girl was their only ticket home. There really  wasn't a choice.</p><p>"Dammit!" The pilot fumed and slapped down her orange visor once  more. "How we looking on fuel?"</p><p>"Approaching Bingo." Her co-pilot stated, the frown on her face  evident in her voice.</p><p>Arisa growled. "Might as well make the most of it... <i>Let's clear  the road!"</i></p><p>Poison Nine dropped like a stone as its pilot rode the throttle to  full military power. Kyouku flipped a switch and the under-slung  plasma cannon tracked her eye movement, sliding onto one of the  larger targets. The gunship blew over the Senshi-NWC strike team and  unleashed, its tri-barreled plasma gatling gun coming to life for the  first time. The barrels spun and lethal streams of white hot energy  spat forth at the rate of two hundred rounds per second, immolating  anything that caught Kyouko's eye. Arisa thumbed her own weapons  selector once and five AX-15s flew off their racks, burning into  several mobs before ripping them apart in a series of detonations,  whose plasma burned scores of youma alive outright.</p><p>Poison Nine covered the ten kilometer path quickly and its crew took  stock of their handiwork. The killing swath they cut had been  spectacular, but the path they had carved was already being replaced  by fresh monsters.</p><p>"Set us up for another pass, Ris," Kyouko ordered. "They're  gonna need continuous suppressive fire if that path is gonna stay  open." Arisa nodded and hauled the gunships nose around.</p><p>"<i>With pleasure."</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>The strike team moved quickly through the smoldering remains,  fighting the advancing youma off at a run. Anybody that could produce  ranged fire quickly moved to the front of their advance in order to  keep the path clear as they moved forward. Ranma let loose another  ki energy burst, and the glowing blue ball vaporized a pack of demons  that insisted on making their acquaintance. Three youma made it past  the attack and the martial artist swung the ring tip around, turning  the first into flaming ash with ease. The second hesitated slightly,  only to find a crecsant blade caress its skull. The demon fell to the  ground, it's head turned to solid ice. She was about ready to engage  the third when her hearing picked up a loud crack at his back. He  only had a second to take in the incident and found Cologne without a  weapon, the result of a stressed cane buckling at high speeds. The  Elder was now suddenly weaponless and facing youma en'masse.</p><p>Even  if Ranma was to never marry her great grand daughter, Cologne was one  of the few people outside of his own blood Ranma considered something  close to family. Removing the threat to her became her number one  priority, and Nova-Ranma's next actions were driven by pure instinct,  instinct that had kept him and his friends alive through too many  situations to count. Ki reflexively flowed into the staff, reversing  the technique that had fused it together. Nova pulled the weapon  apart, whipped around and threw the Gekkaja  across  the space, past Cologne, burying the crescent  blade into the lead youma's sternum. The Elder gave the redhead a  slight nod as she hopped up and retrieved the weapon from its frozen  chest, cutting down the next beast in line. Sailor Nova whirled  around in the same movement, decapitating another youma that had  closed to hand-to-hand with razor disk of the Kinjakan.  She was already moving onto the next target as the head bounced to  the earth unnoticed.</p><p>Nova  ripped anotherMöko  Takabisha downrange and a Space Sword Blaster poured in behind it,  decimating the closest platoon of advancing youma. A line of  incendiary plasma rained down from on high, cutting another swath  forward of their advance. Nova-Ranma looked up and watch the gunship  circle right while the nose mounted cannon picked out its targets and  burned them down.</p><p>"How  much further?" Sailor Neptune called out and unleashed her own  Deep Submerge to further carve into their advance on the Pure Heart  Crystal Reactor.</p><p>"I  said <i>get off me!</i>"  Mercury hollered as more youma pressed her side of the strike team's  defensive circle. "<i>Mercury Aqua Rhapsody</i>  !"  Ribbons flew from the harp in her hands and solidified into massive  streams of water tearing another squad of youma apart as it attempted  to close on her. She turned on the Outer. "Six kilometers!"</p><p>"INCOMING!"  Jupiter screamed as red ball of power streaked in, causing Saturn to  whip around.</p><p>"<i>Silence  Wall!" </i>The angry blob of  power terminated two feet from Jupiter's person as Hotaru erected an  energy barrier with the Glaive. The blast shattered against the wall,  reflecting its potential at the nearby youma instead its intended  target.</p><p>"They're getting tougher people!" Moon called out, blasting a  youma with a pinkish ray after it had gotten up for the second time.  The beam carved a line from the monster's neck to its ribs, an arm  and good portion of torso falling to the ground in a smoldering heap.  This time it stayed down."Watch for energy attacks!</p><p>No  sooner had she uttered the words, another youma glowed brightly and  unleashed a bright red ball of power. The only other person who could  have intercepted the attack besides Saturn was a fraction of a second  too late in noticing the inbound energy, having just dispatched her  own opponent. Sailor Pluto's eyes came off the falling corpse in  front of her and saw the perilously close energy attack. "Garnet  Ba-!" The defensive bubble didn't have time to form and the blast  detonated within their squad, blowing Pluto and another out of  formation and into the the mob, well forward of the strike team. Pluto  shook her head and pushed herself off the ground, only to quickly find  herself surround. Five claws slashed toward her at once and she  desperately tried to complete the technique she had started seconds  ago.</p><p>"<i>Moko Takabisha Double!" </i></p><p>Instead  of the five pronged attack, five smoking corpses fell to her feet  with independent thuds. She turned to find her savior, only to  wretch. The redhead jumped in and began to fend off the other  encroaching masses of claws with terrifying speed, speed Setsuna  could only match if she compressed time. She was also fighting hand  to hand. Had she dropped the Kinjakan?  Pluto brought the heart tipped  staff up into a striking stance and slowed time around her person.</p><p>"Don't think  this makes us even, Saotome!" She snarled and introduced a pack of  youma to her Dead Scream technique. "You <i>will</i> cease to be a  threat by the time I'm through with you!"</p><p>Nova-Ranma's fist  blurred through an attack, something that amazed Setsuna ins pite of  herself. She was in compressed time and they were <i>still</i>  blurring. "Talk's cheap, <i>Set-chan.</i>" The youma practically  fell apart under the assault. "You <i>so</i> need a vacation...  Even if I have to be the one to give it too you!"</p><p>The implied threat  didn't go unnoticed, and Pluto threw the resultant anger at three  more youma, tearing the staff through them. "I have a  responsibility to see the deaths of five point two billion people  aren't in vein! If I need to remove you to make that probability  occur, so be it!"</p><p>"Oh yeah,"  Nova snarled with disgust. "Crystal-fucking-Toyko can go screw  itself too!" Vacuum blades slashed out, eviscerating youma in  depth. She spared a withering glare back at Pluto. "How you can  accept the deaths of billions on the outcome of something that has to  be continual tweaked in order to occur is total insanity!" Ranma's  rage began to roll to a boil.</p><p>Setsuna triggered  a Chronos Typhoon in response as her own temper flared. "You think  I want the deaths of those people on my hands? I've seen the future!  That catastrophe is <i>going</i> to happen! The odds of stopping it  are even slimmer than engineering Crystal Tokyo!" The typhoon  unleashed and shredded demons were sent snapping around her.  "Don't you DARE fucking judge me, boy!"</p><p>"JUDGE YOU?"  The rage flared like Sailor Nova's namesake and ki claws rippled  forth along her knuckles. She barely took notice of them as she  adjusted her attacks to compensate for their reach and attack power.  The ethereal blades cleaved a youma clean in two. "I have your damn  memories stuffed in my head sideways! There's no way you can tell me  Caesar's assassination was necessary!" Pluto nearly faltered in her  attacks at the redheads words. Five more youma went down as the blur  known as Ranma Saotome became a demonic killing machine, ki claws  flashing in nearly every direction at once. The Senshi of Time  mentally calculated their position and decided it would still be  another few minutes before the rest of the team caught up to the  position they were now holding. A small part of her began to know  fear.</p><p>"You've  overstepped Serenity's mandate so many time she'd probably thank me  for taking you out!" This time her attack did falter and Pluto was  reduced to blocking the inbound attacks as some pent up fragment in  her psyche was jarred loose.</p><p>Claws skittered  off the time key as she deflected another attack. "No... That's not  true..." it was a weak protest at best and she found Ranma's eyes  burning into her own.</p><p>"Setsuna  Meiou... Judge, jury and self appointed executioner." A fist buried  itself into one of the demons, ki slivers jutting out its spine.  Pluto's eyes widened and the reality impaled her, causing her to all  but drop her guard and stare at the redhead. She <i>knew</i>. She  knew <i>everything</i>. And it was as if Ranma Saotome, the person  she had fated to die had somehow become her conscious manifest,  voicing every doubt and fear she had so successfully locked up in the  annals of time. "Back on the clock, Pluto!"</p><p>It wasn't a polite  warning, but it was a warning none the less. Her eyes snapped up just  into time block pair of fangs with the length of her staff, wedging  them open before pushing forward and sheering the youma's skull in  half. She compressed time further and slid left, narrowly avoiding  the next three youma attacking in unison. They couldn't keep this up.  There were too many and the team was still a good hundred meters  behind them. She was about to call out to Ranma when something buzzed  through the fuku's embedded communications array.</p><p>"<i>-weapons  inbound! Prepare for direct fire on your position!"</i></p><p>Setsuna took quick stock of the message and her surroundings, finding  the errant Mishima Heavy Industries Gunship approaching at high speed  with ordinance already flying off its racks. White flame sprang from  the nose and realization hit her like a sledgehammer. "Ranma,  <i>DOWN!"</i></p><p>Sheets of fire sprang forth as the world around them was torn apart  violently.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kyouko was jarred in her seat and pushed into the safety harness as  another thud impacted the gunship. The ground based energy fire was  thickening, and even Arisa's superior piloting skills weren't enough  to evade the flashing bolts the demons seemed to be throwing at them.  The gunner picked another target out and hosed it with a hot stream  of plasma fire, which was incredibly effective at annihilating the  larger monsters. Another thud skewed her aim, sending white heat  straying off target and into the ranks of lesser youma. Kyouko  shrugged and silently thanked the engineering staff who had decided  to mount Poison Nine's reactive plating.<p>"Ko-chan, three o'clock." Arisa directed the blond's attention  along the vector and she found two figures ahead of and cut off from  the main group.</p><p>Kyouko panned the nose camera on to them and frowned. "They're not  going to last long out there all alone."</p><p>"Right." The pilot agreed. "Coming around, set us up for close  air support."</p><p>"They might get a little singed." The gunner stated and sighted  the guns relative centimeters pff the hapless combatants.</p><p>"The price of doing business." Arisa stated flatly. "Lock and  load!"</p><p>The nose lined up on the pair and Kyoko spun up the plasma cannon.  She edged the gun sights down the corridor, then hesitated a moment,  keying the radio as an afterthought. "This is Poison Nine on Guard  to allied combatants, weapons inbound, repeat, weapons inbound!  Prepare for direct fire on your position!" God only knew if there  was anybody that could actually receive the unscrambled transmission,  but it was worth a try.</p><p>She pulled down on the trigger and the thirty decawatt plasma cannon  spat white death, tearing a line of fire into the youma ranks closest  to the two lone fighters. The insides of her canopy flashed, and  rockets flew from the wing pylons, spackling the strike zone with  splashes of fire and plasma. Poison Nine flew through the resulting  cloud of smoke, and Arisa pulled the experimental gunship around  through a tight arc.</p><p>"One more pass!" She called out.</p><p>A thundering crash punctuated her remark and Kyoko watched in horror  as her damage console lit up while buzzers squealed in protest. Some  of the ground fire had finally gotten through the plating. "Avionics  are out! We're losing the aft stabilizers!" The entire gunship  shuttered and bucked while Arisa fought the flight stick for a level.  "Crap! Hydrolic failures on the mainlines, switching to backups!"  There was a pause as she flipped the requisite switches. "I'd start  looking for a place to land!"</p><p>Her pilot continued to wrestle with the controls, snarling. "No way  am I going down with unexpended ordinance! Arm the Death Hand!"</p><p>Kyoko  bit her lips. They'd be lucky to come out of this one alive. "AX-20  coming hot! Release on your mark!"</p><p>Arisa centered up on a point between the Senshi-NWC strike team and  the giant crystal thing, grinning evilly. This should give 'em some  breathing room, she through and trigged the weapon. The entire  gunship shuddered as the fat missile left the centerline fuselage  rack, streaking into an untouched mass of youma. The missile seemed  to explode into a fine mist thirty meters above the ground, showering  the general area with a glimmering fog. A second later a bright spark  ignited within the cloud and the fog was transformed into a brilliant  fireball. The shock wave rolled out, flattening demons for hundreds  of meters before incinerating them inside the air-fuel generated  explosion. The fireball climbed into the dusk sky, causing Arisa's  maniacal smile to grow.</p><p>It was a short lived smile.</p><p>Another jarring crash hit her aircraft, and the gunship protested by  slewing hard to the right. <i>"Say goodbye to engine one!"</i>  Kyouko called out frantically, and Arisa watched flames spiral from  the stricken turbofan.</p><p>The pilot could feel the controls slipping away from her and it was  no longer a matter of fighting for them as they lost life with each  passing second. Arisa used the last of it to point the nose into the  smoldering clearing she had just cleared.</p><p>"This is the end of Poison Nine! <i>Crash positions!"</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>Sailor Moon watched the angry fire ball consume the youma in front of  them as their group moved in and encircled the battered Senshi Pluto  and Nova. "You two alright!" Both stared at her with a dead  look, as if their disheveled state and torn fukus didn't tell all.  "Um, right. I think you dropped this, Nova." Moon handed the  crimson fuku her ring-tipped staff, and the redhead nodded her  thanks.</p><p>"That jet did a good job at clearing-" Sailor Jupiter was  commenting just as the for mentioned jet streaked overhead and into  the smoking field of fire it had just created. "Crap! It's been  hit!"</p><p>"Several times by the looks of it." Michiru noted as she followed  the gunship down.</p><p>Both Sailor Nova and Pluto watched as well, the same thoughts running  through their head. "That gunship saved our ass." Nova stated and  Pluto nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Then we'd better get around to saving theirs." Pluto finished,  and the Sailors set of at a dead run, whose speed was significantly  aided by the fact that every youma between them and the reactor had  been reduced to crispy critters. The youma behind them were a  different matter entirely, and happily gave chase with claws, fangs  and magical energy fire. Regardless, the Senshi-NWC strike team was  out-pacing them faster then the demon's meager accuracy allowed, and  were quickly left in the dust. Shampoo found the debris laden trench  first and the team followed it to the gunship's crash site, whose  fuselage had been mauled, but was otherwise intact... minus the  wings, nose gun, and entire left side of reactive plating. Carbon  scoring made it obvious to determine where the aircraft had received  its fatal fire.</p><p>"Any survivors?" Mercury called into the wreckage and an armored  figure stepped out from behind the aircraft. If she looked carefully,  Ami could even note that it was blond behind the visor.</p><p>"I think so," The figure answered, obviously still a bit shaken.  "I'm Kyoko. Arisa will be out-"</p><p>"I swear I'm gonna kill that cat-girl the minute we get out of  here!" The armored brunette fumed as she stepped out of Poison  Nine's cargo hold attaching a machine gun feed to the gatling gun  mounted on her gauntlet.</p><p>"Reow?" Nuku stared at the familiar toys curiously. On one hand  they represented both threat and playtime. On the other, they'd  helped her husband-sister only minutes before. Arisa froze mid-step  and stared at the source of her incessant angst.</p><p>"We don't have time for this." Pluto stated, breaking the odd  staring contest. "If you can move, we've got to get to <i>that</i>,"  The Senshi pointed at the giant crystalline globe now looming large  in the sky. "Before <i>they</i> get to us." She pointed back to  the ranks of youma that were finally beginning to catch up to them.  That finally focused both cat-girl and cooperate officer back on the  matter at hand, and the newly formed Senshi-NWC-Mishima team broke  from the dead gunship at a run. Even as they did, Kyoko was proud.  Poison Nine was not only the first gunship of the Poison line to see  live fire under real battlefield conditions, but it was also the  first Poison model <i>not</i> to be taken out by a cat-girl... A rare  and distinct honor.</p><p>Energy bolts continued to pepper their backsides as they found the  base of the Pure Heart Crystal reactor, which seemed to float atop a  giant pillar The pillar itself could only be described as technology,  a power converter, Mercury termed it. It glowed an eerie green, a  stark contrast to the brilliant pink crystal globe. There was only  one way to the top, a long staircase whose entrance was blocked by a  dull glow. The Strike team arrayed itself at the foot of the pillar.</p><p>Ami pulled out the Mercury link, aiming it at the glow. "Force  shield, fourteen point eight terrawatts in strength. Don't touch it."  Nuku Nuku pulled her finger back from the glow. She turned around and  pointed the clamshell PDA in the opposite direction. "We have about  one minute, thirty seconds before eighteen thousand youma arrive on  this position to hand us our asses." Sailor Jupiter blinked at the  normally reserved Senshi's cursing.</p><p>Pluto simply nodded and turned to Hotaru. "Do it."</p><p>Sailor Saturn nodded and took a deep breath, gathering her power.  She balance the Silence Glaive in her hand and pointed it into the  shield.</p><p>"One minute." Ami called out the time. A dull rumbling could be  heard in the distance.</p><p>"<i>Death Reborn  Revolution!" </i></p><p>Hotaru plunged the Glaive into the shield, which exploded in  brilliance as the ancient weapon triggered a reaction that siphoned  the barrier's power away into impotence. The Glaive glowed a bright  orange as if it were about to melt, but otherwise held its structure.  The bright barrier pulsed once more and seemed to shatter completely.  The shield was down.</p><p>"We need to go, <i>now!" </i>Ami warned as the first blasts of  magical fire began to rain down on their position. The front lines of  the massing youma were now visible in all their horrid glory.  Something shrieked overhead and Haruka saw it first. It was a youma.  With <i>wings</i>. She picked it out of the shifting dusk sky and  blasted it with her space sword. That was the team's cue, and every  member began the retreat up the stairway while the youma army pressed  forward... the youma army meant for <i>Earth, </i>and each person on  the team realized that this was only a fraction of its main host.  They reached the top and platform and had barely a moment to take in  the beautiful pink atrocity floating above them.</p><p>"Ris-chan! Supressive fire!" Kyouko called out and aimed her her  armor mounted gatling guns down the stairs, the same stairs the youma  now advanced up. Her friend took a stance beside her, raising her own  gauntlet miniguns. The multi-barreled cannons whirled to life, and a  buzz saw sound cut through the air as they spat six hundred rounds  per second down range, shredding their front lines. The Senshi  began to add their own firepower and Mousse stepped to the front,  cutting loose with every edged weapon in his formitable arsenal.  Even Cologne began to throw ki blasts at a rate that made Nova-Ranma  pale. She was already something around three hundred years old.  Throwing that much spirit energy around couldn't be good for her  longevity.</p><p>Pluto stepped back and pulled the Elerium WMD out of her personal  weapon space, setting it on the platform gently. The silver casing  glowed pink, reflecting the PHC reactor's light above. "Princess,  the codes."</p><p>Sailor  Moon stepped forward and ran a gentle finger down its mirrored chrome  casing. She reached into her fuku and pulled a crinkled  piece of paper from between her breasts and stared at it.</p><p>"You kept the codes for a one gigaton weapon of mass destruction  <i>between your breasts?</i>" Ami boggled, staring at the princess,  who in turn stuck her tongue out at the Mercury. Usagi turned back to  the deadly shining oval.</p><p>"Omicron-Omicron-Omega-Break-Five." She read and the weapon  simply sat there.</p><p>"<i>Activation codes recognized. Good day, Princess Serenity."</i>  Usagi binked. Pretty polite for a bomb.</p><p>Moon looked back down at the piece of paper in her hand, reading it  word for word. "Aramament stage one, five minutes."</p><p>"<i>Armament, Stage One, confirmed. Delayed activation set to minus  five minutes."</i> It stated calmly, a stark contrast to the  frantic defense going on only a few feet away at the steps. <i>"Awaiting  final armament authorization."</i></p><p>Usagi Tsukino took a deep, trembling  breath. "Defense of the Realm."</p><p>"<i>Thank you, Princess Serenity."</i>  The bomb replied. <i>"This unit will now detonate in time minute  five minutes. Countermand will expire at time minus one minute. Full  anti-tampering countermeasures engaged."</i></p><p>Moon was at a loss.  "Now what?" She looked at Pluto.</p><p>"<i>Recommend all personnel  proceed to minimum safe distance." </i>The bomb replied to the  misdirected question. <i>"Minimum safe distance for this unit is  two thousand five hundred and thirty eight miles."</i></p><p>"In other words  it's time to get the hell out of dodge!" Nova hollered over her  shoulder as she cut loose with another Moko Takabisha. Her blast was  augmented by Mars' Fire Snake, checking the advancing demons.</p><p>"I'm down to  three thousand rounds!" Arisa called out as she reset her gatling  gun's overheat breaker for the second time.</p><p>"Two thousand  five over here!" Kyoko called out as the pair continued to pump 20  millimeter slugs into the stalled youma lines. She soberly noted that  the only reason they were stalled was because of the narrow stairway  versus the fire being poured into it.</p><p>"<i>Four minutes,  thirty seconds."</i> The bomb added sedately.</p><p>"Forming the  gate!" Pluto called out and fed power into creating a wormhole back  to universe proper. The shimmering distortion formed, wavered and  died in front of her. "What the hell!" She tried again, feeding  more power into the gate. The result was the same. Ami was already on  the problem.</p><p>"The THC Reactor  is pumping out too much energy. We need to gain some distance before  trying again!" She replied, interpreting the Mercury links  readings.</p><p>"How far?"  Usagi asked with concern.</p><p>Sailor Mercury  frowned, as she was often wont to do in this miserable universe. "One  kilometer."</p><p>Sailor Moon's eyes  widened. It didn't take a genius to do the math. "One kilometer is  out <i>there!</i>" She pointed into the unending tide of youma.</p><p>"One thousand  rounds!" Arisa called out, the barrels on her armored gauntlet  glowing with heat.</p><p>"I'm nearly dry!"  Kyoko reported as the last of five hundred rounds fed through the  belt.</p><p>Ranma Saotome through furiously. If the volume of fire dropped even  by a small margin, the youma standstill would turn into a crushing  advance, an advance their team desperately need themselves. Her  brain's tactical computer spun into overdrive, calculating the team's  combined firepower and the techniques at their disposal. The martial  artist handed the Kinjakan  back to Moon. She was gonna need both hands free for this one.  "Ryoga! Breaking point on my mark!" Ryoga was at his side without  question and the two stood by as Arisa and Kyoko expended the last of  their munitions.</p><p>"I'm out!"  Kyoko called as the cannon wound down. "Standing by on RPGs!"  Secured hatches on the power armor's shoulder pods flipped open,  exposing twelve rocket propelled grenades to open air.</p><p>"Out!" Arisa  called, her cannon dying as well. "Cut 'em loose!" Rockets flared  out from the armor and twenty four high explosive grenades settled  into the youma front lines, detonating in a spectacular display of  fragmenting pyrotechnics.</p><p>"NOW!"  Nova-Ranma yelled and Ryoga Hibiki stepped forward, pushing his  finger into the stairs at their feet.</p><p>"<i>Bakuai  Tenketsu!"</i></p><p>No sooner had the stone pathway  shattered, Ranma herself was inside the the blast radius with the  chestnut fist, tagging every one of the fragments Ryoga had dislodged,  and sent them into the demonic crowd below like high-speed human machine  gun. "AGAIN!" Ryoga stepped forward a second time and more  stone shattered. Ranma seemed untouchable in the stone whirlwind as  he repeated the dual technique. The youma lines faltered.</p><p>"<i>Three minutes."</i></p><p>Cologne  hopped forward and touched the ground with the not-so lethal end of  the Gekkaja,  duplicated the technique she had taught the Lost Boy herself. More  stone shattered and this time Shampoo was in the cloud of stone, her  purple hair whirling through the chestnut fist with determination.  The added firepower was enough and the lines cracked. The remaining  Senshi poured everything into them, while two suits of power armor and  one cat-girl went hand to hand, pulverizing any demon that made it  through the hail of stone.</p><p>"Saturn, take out  the stairway base!" Pluto directed and Hotaru focused the Glaive.</p><p>"<i>Silence  Glaive Surprise!" </i>Another five  blocks of youma evaporated as the woman deemed a strategic weapon of  war brought the stave down, mercilessly turning anything in front of  her to cinders. The NWCs new Chestnut Breaking Point technique made  short work of anything not consumed by the fireball, and the combined  strike team secured the base of the pillar.</p><p>"Two-thirty!" Mercury called out as they moved away from the  reactor, allowing Pluto the distance to try her technique again. This  time, the gateway formed flawlessly and the shimmering, distorted  curtain hung at the groups' center while they fought off increasing  pressure from the youma army.</p><p>"Moon first!" Pluto yelled and Usagi studddered.</p><p>"What? No way! I can't leave!"</p><p>"You can and you will!" Nova countered. "Princesses and animal  cursed martial artists first!"</p><p>"But-!" Nova and Pluto shared a knowing look, and the Senshi of  exploding stars was by her side in a flash, locking Usagi's arm  behind her. "OW!"</p><p>"In you go, your worshipfulness!" Sailor Nova took the Kinjakan  from her and shoved Moon through the portal and  returned to the defensive line. "Time to leave, people!" One by  one, the Senshi filed through, which in turn presented a difficult  problem to Ranma as they did so. The increase in open terrain worked  to their enemy's advantage, allowing them to attack from all sides at  maximum strength. On top of that, the teams collective firepower  weakened as they retreated through the porthole one by one. The only  person that truly need to remain was Pluto, with somebody to keep the  demons off her as she held the gate open. Cologne gave Ranma a  knowing look as she handed the Gekkaja  back to her.</p><p>"Fight  well, Son in-law." Shampoo and Mousse went first, followed by the  Amazon matriarch. Only Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn remained, and it was the bare minimum they could cut without their  lines collapsing entirely.</p><p>"Point of  no return!" Mercury called out, glancing longingly at the portal as  she iced another platoon of youma. "One minute!"</p><p>Sailor Nova fused  the Gekkaja and Kinjakan back together. It was time to get serious.  She stepped to the center of the defensive ring around the wormhole  and began feeding power into the newly reformed staff. Ki flowed in a  circle from her to it and back and back, twirling the staff wildly in  preperation for the ultimate technique that existed only in her minds  eye, up until now.</p><p>"<i>Hiryu..."  </i></p><p>The razor ring  snapped away, igniting as it took flight. The Staff of Ascension  continued to twirl in her hands, and the guided ring spiraled  outward, trailing super-heated air.</p><p>"<i>Shoten..."</i></p><p>The spiral continued  to expand out beyond their lines, and over the youma horde. The staff  spun and Ranma focused every ounce of ki into the technique. If it  worked, it'd give Pluto and herself the need breathing room to  retreat themselves. If not... Well, they'd both buy it in a  spectacular fasion.</p><p>"<i>Ha..."</i></p><p>The  twisting stopped and Ranma flipped the staff around, its crescent  blade facing downward. With a might heave, she shoved the blade into  the ground, turning it to ice for hundreds of meters.</p><p>"<i>ASCENSION!"</i></p><p>The shock wave  ripped out from the staff and along the super-heated line of  atmosphere, uncoiling like the dragon Ranma had unleashed so many  times before. But now, those dragons seemed like fence lizards  compared to the one she had now loosed. Air pressure and ki ripped  outward beyond Nova , Pluto, and into the waiting army of youma where  it crushed them mercilessly. The shock wave followed the heated  spiral to the end and became self sustaining, forming into a tempest  the likes of which few had ever seen. Saturn jumped through the  portal, followed quickly by Mercury. Nova held onto the ice embedded  staff for dear life as the winds threatened to rip her arms out of  their sockets.</p><p>Then there was  Pluto.</p><p>Pluto stood within  the subspace buffer between reality and the gate, realitively  unaffected by the technique. She made a mental consultation of her  internal clock. Fifteen seconds and inches. She could literally leave  Ranma out here to either die by her own technique or roast in the  nuclear fires created by the bomb, but either way the redhead would  be out of her hair for good. But could she leave such a person out to  dry like that? She had before. Caesar had been a patriot too. Ten  seconds. Wind sheared across Ranma without respite, while everything  within ten miles was being shredded by her own hypervelocity  maelstrom. Pluto considered the redhead. A patriot. Somebody who took  the odds without regard for her own like and saftey. Somebody who  knew Princess of Pluto just as well as she knew herself. Somebody  who would do the right thing <i>no matter what</i>... Could she kill  another one? Yes. Could she kill another one and stay sane...?</p><p>Five seconds.</p><p>Ranma Saotome's grip  on the staff was beginning to slip as frost crept up the shaft she so  desperately clung to. She couldn't even open her eyes as they'd be  more than likely sheared out of their sockets the moment she did so.  But then, nobody ever said the life of a martial artist wasn't  fraught with peril, doubly so for ones that turned into magical  girls, she though with grim humor. The gate was too far away for her  to leap into the winds she had whipped into exitance, all of which begged  the only question that mattered- Which would kill her first? The new  technique or the bomb. A bright flash of light through the condensed  cloud answered her question. The Elerium blastwave rushed forward  and she steeled herself for the end...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ten women, two men  and one android stared at the shimmering Earthside portal as it  wavered with instability. They had all made it through with two  notable exceptions. Ice checked the guts of each team member with  each flicker the gateway produced. Finally it flared with power and  collapsed with sudder of distance thunder. The team simply stood  staring at the now empty portion of blue sky in muted shock.<p>Neither Ranma  Saotome <i>or</i> Sestuna Meiou had returned.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ami sat at a desk  inside the Inner's apartment, pouring her attention over a stack of  papers, cross referencing them with the Mercury link's data.<p>"Anything?"</p><p>She looked up into  the blue eyes of Usagi, whose expression was as somber as her own.  "Nothing. I've got every scrap of telemetry the second link could  send us before it was vaporized, and everything I've seen so far  indicates they were both still there when the bomb went off."</p><p>"They're really  gone, then..." Usagi slumped into a chair beside Ami.</p><p>"By all accounts,  that entire universe is gone." Ami frowned, brushing an errant  strand of cobalt blue hair out of her eyes.</p><p>Moon was about to  reply when a pink haired girl slipped into the room and paused,  noticing the long faces on her future mother and friend. "What's  wrong?"</p><p>"Setsuna and Yum-  I mean, Ranma..." Usagi started, but found herself unable to  finish.</p><p>"What about uncle  and Set-chan?" Small Lady asked with wide, innocent eyes.</p><p>Ami stared down at  the table. "They didn't make it back with us."</p><p>Chibi Usa blinked  and a smile crept across her face. "Oh, I wouldn't worry about  that."</p><p>Ami's head snapped  up. Usagi blinked. "You wouldn't?"</p><p>"Nah." The smile  grew. "Everything will turn out fine. You'll see."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Epilogue One for the original funny ending,<p>Epilogue Two for the DVD Directors Cut serious ending.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's Notes:</b><br/>"Epilogue, one? Epilogue two?" Hehe... Hehehe... MwhAHAHAHAHAH!  -ahem- Sorry about that. You are undoubtably wondering what exactly the  deal is with the epilogue one and two bit. <i>I ain't tellin'</i>. So all those who thought you'd glean some useful information from these ANs, boy were <i>you</i> sadly mistakin'. It'll all become clear with the next update, but let's just say that one ending wasn't enough.<p>Beyond  the teasing, I hope you've enjoyed the story up to this point, as this  was the grand finale. Well, almost. You still have one more part to go.  Or two. Depending on how incessantly I tease you :D</p><p><b>Special Thanx</b> to Trimatter and DCG for their comments, DT and Fukufics for their help.</p><p>A  note on grammar, corrections, spelling, etc... Some of you will feel  compelled to note these errors and list them in the reviews section.  Before you do and since I have your attention with the Epilogue stunt,  know two things- It's not that I don't care exactly, but  there a balance between the enjoyment of writing, not getting paid and  my own time/impatience. I make a pass at the chapter and anything that's  left I can normally live with. Second, it's called  a REVIEW section, <b>not</b>  an editing section. This comment is mainly targeted at the habitual  offenders who feel the burning desire to post nothing but corrections  with next to no review content. I realize some of you mean well, but <i>that much</i> editing needs to go to my email box, not the review section.</p><p>To everybody else, keep doing what you're doing, including you, BorgRabbit. Thanks for the heads up.</p>
