</div><p><b>The Best of Times…</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i><br/>A  Fukufics (dotcom) Production</p><p><b>Part 2</b></p><p><b>S</b>etsuna Meiou  paced in front of the time gates, clad in functional, yet revealing  body armor that made up her Sailor Pluto persona. Body armor was  perhaps too generous of a term for the short, tight black and white  fuku she now wore, but after centuries of use, she was all but  oblivious to the fact. Even if she were somehow self conscious of the  garb she now wore, only one thing occupied her mind at present.</p><p>Ranma Saotome was SO  going to pay.</p><p>The fact that he was  able to gain access to her home was disconcerting enough, but he  shouldn't have even known she <i>existed</i>, let alone know where  to find her… Or that she was deathly afraid of cockroaches. The  last thought caused a shiver to ripple through her body and she  forced her attention back to the time gates in front of her. Knowing  her most deep seated phobia pointed to a level of knowledge that  should have been well beyond the martial artist's ability to  obtain, especially since the two people who did know were dead right  along with the Silver Millennium. It also begged the question of  exactly how much he <i>did </i>know? Either way, one thing was  obvious: Mister Saotome obviously had too much free time on his  hands. An evil smile cracked Sailor Pluto's normally emotionless  mask. So he wants to play on my fears, hmmm? She adjusted the time  flow of the gates to just the right moment and the evil smile grew.</p><p>Time to teach Ranma  Saotome that you don't screw with the Mistress of Time.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>By  any measure it had been a good day for Ranma Saotome, heir to the  Anything Goes School of Martial Arts. Which is to say it had actually  been a very <i>bad</i> one. He had come to realize early on that any  good day for him meant that there was a woeful imbalance of karma in  the universe and sooner or later his person would be the conduit to  bring it back into balance in a most unpleasant manner. Akane was  happy today, which was a bad sign. She had even been humming on their  way to school, which by Ranma's standard was the herald to the Four  Horsemen of the Apocalypse. He had not been splashed once by cold  water, which probably meant the seas would be overflowing with blood  soon enough, and Nabiki even gave him a pass today. Ranma was certain  that if he looked up into the sky he would not only find a total  eclipse of the sun, but a burning two hundred mile wide meteor poised  to smite all of mankind for its trespasses. Or maybe it was just all  in his head. After all, it's only paranoia if nobody is out to get  you. Which <i>they </i>usually were. 'They' being any number of  people, in Ranma's case.<p>He was almost  relieved to find out Akane was cooking since Kasumi was on a date  with Doc Tofu. Ranma would take his punishment like a man and karma  would be brought back into alignment for nothing more than a  stomachache and a week's worth of indigestion. It was a fair  compromise in his opinion. Better him take the karmatic bullet than  watch as all of civilization collapsed around him simply because he  couldn't stomach Akane's cooking. Of course, sometimes it fought  back harder than Ryoga, but then the life of a martial artist is  fraught with peril, right?</p><p>A  smiling Akane sat the dish down in front of him and Ranma knew he was  in trouble. She had mentioned that she was making chow mein and what  was on the plate actually <i>looked </i>like chow mein. His sense of  dread grew exponentially at the realization that she had really  cooked something that bore a superficial resemblance to its namesake.  All eyes were on him of course, being the official Tendo sacrificial  lamb. He was their canary in the coalmine, because if he keeled over,  the food was undoubtedly toxic and not to be touched under any  circumstances by the rest of the family. In fact, his fits of agony  would probably provide the perfect distraction by which to escape  their evil daughter's culinary masochism. Ranma steeled himself and  took the first bite of noodles. His life flashed before his eyes and  he knew it with certainty…</p><p><i>They  were all gonna die</i>.</p><p>It  would be a sick and painful death, undoubtedly riddled with screaming  torture and anguish. It would be suffering on a magnitude never  before seen, unimaginable in its scope. And just how did Ranma  Saotome know such a hideous fate awaited him? Quite easily, actually.</p><p>The  food was <i>good</i>.</p><p>Akane  looked at him with The Question sparkling in her eyes. The Question,  if answered incorrectly held the promise of swift and painful  retribution, as to insult her cooking was akin to insulting life  itself… Which it sometimes was, as Ranma had observed from her past  attempts to bend and twist the very fabric of culinary reality  whenever she manned the kitchen. The rest of the family also looked  upon him with The Question. Their responses, however, would be quite  different if Ranma keeled over within the next five minutes; Probably  along the lines of taking iodine tablets and breaking out the  biohazard gear that was normally left collecting dust in the hall  closet. Even Kasumi was not so foolish as to take a bite on the  promise of Akane's good will alone. No, it wasn't an acquired  taste. It was as if the youngest sister's cooking mutated like a  virus to ensure that it would not only continue to taste bad, but  inflict severe hemorrhaging on the unfortunate victim who managed to  ingest it. Few realized that was, in fact, the real reason Kasumi  Tendo studied medicine as a hobby. Finding a cure to Akane's  cooking would be worthy of a Nobel Prize in and of itself.</p><p>"Well?"</p><p>Ranma  considered his fiancee's question as he swallowed. "Um, it's  good."</p><p>The  family blinked. Impossible. "Then what's the matter?" Akane  asked with a perturbed edge in her voice. It was all but impossible  to miss the pigtailed boys anxiety. Normally it would have been  directed squarely at her masterpiece, but today her assumption was  totally incorrect. Ranma was about to answer when a knocking at the  door was heard. Ranma's sense of dread deepened. He knew what was  at the door.</p><p>Karma.</p><p>And  it had just come home to roost.</p><p>"Oh,  I'll get it." Kasumi stated happily, rising from the dinner  table. Ranma really wished she wouldn't, and his eyes tracked her  with nervous apprehension. It was like some sadistic game show, and  Ranma knew exactly what was behind door number one. Not its contents  per se, but given how well the day had gone so far, it just couldn't  be good. In fact, it was probably the embodiment of all life  consuming evil at this point, especially with Akane's cooking  having been palatable. Whatever it was, her cooking actually being  edible was like pulling the pin on a live grenade. Kasumi opened the  gateway to karmatic balance and a new voice was heard.</p><p>"Um,  hello. Would this happen to be the Saotome residence?" The speaker  might have easily been a relative of Dotor Tofu, save the cigarette  hanging from his mouth and disheveled white lab coat draping across  his person. He adjusted his round glasses absently.</p><p>"No, this is the  Tendo residence," Kasumi corrected with a smile. "but the  Saotomes are currently staying with us." She then looked around the  man and found a small boy and a teenage girl standing behind him. The  boy she wasn't sure about, but a teenage girl with dark pink hair  and a grin the size of Tokyo could only mean one thing… "Oh my,  another fiancée?" Ranma heard the words from the table and  groaned while Akane practically burned him down with a glare. Nabiki  and Soun, however instantly turned to on Genma, who was  unsuccessfully trying to look like an innocent panda.</p><p>Doctor  Kyuusaku Natsume blinked.  "As a matter of fact…<b>"</b>Kasumi nodded and  led them in as if it were an everyday fact of life, which it was.  Another fiancée in Ranma's life was as natural as the dawn  of a new day to the residents of the Tendo Dojo. At least this  particular fiancée appeared to have some sort of modesty.  After all, most of his fiancées seemed to arrive in various  states of undress, not conservative school uniforms.</p><p>"Ranma,  there's a new fiancée here to see you." The trio stopped  short behind Kasumi and Ranma sighed standing up from the table. He  cast his own withering sidelong glance at the panda before turning  back to their new guests.</p><p>"Alright,  what'd he sell me for this time?"</p><p>The  mangled cigarette in the doctor's mouth twitched slightly. The fact  that Nuku Nuku would be a "new" fiancée wasn't lost on  him. Still, it hardly mattered. This would be an excellent social  experience for the android designated NK1124, which was the entire  point of the engagement to begin with. "Hmmm, if I recall  correctly… Wait, let me check." Kyuusaku  dug a folded piece of paper from the lab coat and stared at it. "Ah!  I cleared his bar tab for the engagement to one Ranma Saotome. Is  that you?"</p><p>Ranma  stared at the doctor, then the smiling girl who was practically  jumping out of her skin. The boy at the doctor's side simply  watched with wide-eyed curiosity as the events around him continued  to unfold. His eyes flicked back to the girl. There was something  vaguely disquieting about her. "Yeah, it's me." He took the  contract and studied it for a bit before handing it off to Nabiki.</p><p>The  middle Tendo studied it herself and nodded. "Yep. It's legit."  As if that was her cue, the new fiancée in question squealed  in delight as she bounced past her father and pounced onto Ranma with  glee.</p><p>"Yay!  Nuku Nuku has husband now!<i> Reow!</i>" Nuku pinned her husband to be  onto the floor and gave him a lick on the cheek. Now up close and  personal, Ranma stared into her eyes and it all snapped into place.</p><p>"Cu-Cu-Cu-…"  Ranma studdered as Nuku Nuku's smile widened, revealing a cute pair  of fangs. For Ranma, they were far from cute. They merely severed to  complete the illusion he was absolutely terrified of. "Cu…  CAAAAAAaaaaATTTT!" Ranma squirmed in an attempt to break free of  the girl, which took some effort as she weighed several times his  body mass. Free himself he did and the chase was on, Ranma bolting  out of the house with a super-powered android cat girl in hot  pursuit. She was more than happy to oblige her new husband, who  obviously enjoyed his playtime as much as she did. There was a dull  crash from outside the house and the Tendo's winced. More property  damage. More fiancées. What else could go wrong?</p><p>They  really shouldn't have asked.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It  was one of Ranma's worst nightmares come to life. Somehow he had  avoided falling into the influence of the Neko Ken; only barely and  only because a new nightmare came to take its place. Ranma eyes  flicked around nervously. It was one of the more worst-case scenarios  he could have possibly imagine.<p>He  was surrounded.</p><p>That  in itself was nothing to a martial artist of his caliber. He had been  surrounded by ninja, phoenix people, demons and the like. That  wouldn't come close to shaking his ever-present confidence. But the  current situation had. Badly. To his left stood the Okanomiyaki  Master herself, combat spatula at the ready. To his right, one purple  haired Chinese Amazon, heiress to the Joketsuzoku  Amazon tribe and part time cat. Ranma shivered involuntarily. In  front of him was Akane Tendo, who like the other girls, just happened  to track him down at the most inopportune moment. Ranma had an answer  for that little bit of coincidence.</p><p><i>Pluto.</i></p><p>Behind him was the  newest fiancée, the pink haired cat girl that not only  reminded him of a feline, but of an Amazon as well with her  simplistic command of the Japanese language and pinkish hair. A very,  <i>very</i> bad combination. To round it all off, Kodachi was  balanced lightly on the rooftop above him in her rose embroidered  leotard, gymnastics ribbon floating lightly in evening breeze. Akane  was there to exact retribution for his two timing perverted ways.  Shampoo was there to claim the fiancée rightfully hers by  Amazon law. Kodachi stood by as the only women regal enough to claim  the Soatome's heart. Nuku Nuku was absolutely sure this one was  hers because he even reminded her of a cat, while Ukyo was on scene  because of her childhood friend and fiancée to be. Of course,  they all had one thing in common besides Ranma… <i>Genma </i>Saotome.  Well, not Kodachi. She was just plain insane. The pigtailed martial  artists made it a mental note to put his father on the list right  behind Setsuna Meiou… That is if he ever got out of the situation  alive.</p><p>He  couldn't have known that Sailor Pluto picked this new fiancée  for a specific reason. Sure, she was a new fiancée, which  would stir the pot even more. Yes, there was the fact that she had  the brain of a cat and would terrify Ranma to no end. But that wasn't  the entire reason she went with Atsuko Natsume as Ranma's newest  torment. Being a cat-girl didn't make her special. After all, Japan  was full of them, and Setsuna loved to deal in  subtleties. In fact, one of those subtleties was less than five  minutes out from his present location.</p><p>"I've aquired  the target!" Kyouko  confirmed from her tactical position behind the pilot. "This is  Poison Eight, requesting attack clearance!" The blonde flipped a  few switched on control board in front of her, anticipating the  answer.</p><p>A  feminine voice laced with steel crackled across the open channel. "Is  Ryu-chan nearby?"</p><p>"Negative!"  Poison Eight's weapon's officer returned with certainty.</p><p>"Then  eliminate the NK 1124 with extreme predjudice!" her boss's voice  was practically shrill now.</p><p>A  sadistic grin slipped across the pilots face. "With pleasure, boss!  Going weapons hot!" Not that Arisa would have needed attack  clearance to loose copious amounts of high explosive ordinance,  Kyouko noted as the brown haired pilot flipped her visor down in  anticipation. Still, it was always better to have the approval on  record for both their sakes. And careers.</p><p>Arisa  shoved the throttle forward into the stops and cackled manically as  the fresh-off-the-line Poison Eight shot through the night sky,  descending onto its target. The gunship was the newest in Mishima  Heavy Industries line of Close Air Support attack aircraft. Held  aloft by twin turbofan propulsion, the Poison line had the distinct  honor of having racked up more combat hours than any other production  aircraft built by Mishima, despite the fact that it had never seen  either mass production or a major conflict. It was also a dubious  honor that prototypes one through seven had been destroyed in the  care of corporate officers Arisa and Kyouko while trying to  neutralize the android designated NK 1124. Suffice to say, Arisa's  bloodthirsty tendencies concerning her target had been honed to a  fine edge.</p><p>Poison  Eight had seen numerous enhancements since the mark one originally  rolled off the line, and its repeated losses to the android girl had  taught Mishima's engineers a thing or two. Eight's primary  armament had been upgraded significantly, opting for thirty decawatt  plasma cannon instead of the traditional twenty millimeter gatling  gun mounted under the nose. The designers figured that after watching  the 1124's damage absorption abilities, they needed something that  ensured whatever got hit stayed down. Sure, it didn't have the rate  of fire the gatling gun had, but it was sledgehammer to be sure.  Likewise, every missile on the craft had been swapped out in favor of  guided fragmenting warheads, as direct hits with the armor piercing  types had proven impossible against such a nimble target. The logic  was simple enough—carpet an area with the new AX-15s and whatever  you were trying to hit was bound to come out peppered with  fragmentation damage, hopefully slowing it down enough to get in a  few good shots with the plasma cannon.</p><p>None  of this really mattered to Arisa as she thumbed the orange guard that  protected the trigger on her flight stick. She was now one with  Poison Eight and it was time for some long, <i>long</i> overdue  payback. "Multiple targets detected!" the blond called out as her  scope lit up with new energy readings. The pilot hesitate a moment,  finger caressing the weapons release trigger. "Six new signatures,  one has a power level as high as Kyusakuu's android!"</p><p>"Another  damn robot!" Arisa snarled and thumbed the weapons select button  over to the AX-15s. Her battle cry roared through the cockpit.</p><p>"<i>No  survivors!"<hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>Nuku  Nuku heard it first, a dull thumping that echoed through the night  sky. Ranma hear it next while the remaining fiancées remained  oblivious in their standoff. He turned to find Nuku no longer focused  on him but at some point in the distance. For her part, her  cybernetically assisted cat brain knew exactly what it was and she  took up an attack stance to counter the threat. Ranma, however, was  at a loss. First, she was a cat girl, the stuff of nightmares. Second  she was reacting to a threat, no longer paying attention to the  escalation of fiancées. He hated cats with a passion and  fiancées were a pain, but through the panic churning within he  knew that even his cat-self intrinsically knew good from evil, even  if he wasn't all their in thehead at the time. Ranma's 20/20  vision picked out the spec in the night sky, identifying it as some  sort of high tech aircraft.</p><p>The  argument continued around him and the aircraft drew closer. There was  no mistaking where it was heading either. Nuku tensed and puffs of  smoke began pouring from the approaching gunship. Ranma wasn't the  most technologically savvy, nor was he up to date on the latest  military hardware, so the term "guided missile" meant absolutely  nothing to him. The fact that there were now multiple high-speed  projectiles inbound for there position was not lost on him however,  and it didn't take a genius to imagine their effects. Nuku Nuku  certainly wasn't a genius, a fact that bode well for the Saotome's  own mental process concerning the inbound ordinance.</p><p>"<i>Moko  Takabisha!"</i></p><p>The  feuding fiancées about fell over as the first ki bolt roared  out and Nuku Nuku was already airborne and out fifty feet, landing  lightly on one of the streaking missiles before hoping onto the next  one down the line as if they were stepping stones to the new threat.  Each hop strategically knocked a missile off course, sending it  harmlessly into a field or abandoned building. Another ki-shot  blasted out, vaporizing any missile the cat girl had missed on her  way to the gunship. Even as panicked as the fiancées were by  the sudden activity, it didn't match what was going on in the  cockpit of Poison Eight at that exact same moment.</p><p>"<i>Anti-aircraft  fire, break right!"</i> The blond screamed and her pilot yanked the  stick all the way over as two bright blue balls of energy streaked  by. Kyouko was expecting a  lot of things from this particular mission. Property damage? Sure. A  busted up Poison Close Air Support gunship? Probably. An angry  cat-girl android? Definitely. But the last thing she was expecting  was to actually have to power up the Poison's state of the art  electronic countermeasures array to evade incoming fire. "ECM  online! Popping chaff and flares!"</p><p>Arisa  cursed profusely as she yanked the stick back, lining the nose up for  another shot. As if the super-powered 1124 wasn't bad enough, that  damn scientist was now equipping his androids with anti-aircraft  weaponry! What was all that crap he spewed about not creating a war  machine, then? The heads up display began to sync up for a lock on  the anti-aircraft battery when a massive thud shook the craft</p><p><i>THWaaM!</i></p><p>"Are  we hit!" Kyouko squeeled  then turned to see what Arisa was already seeing—one highly annoyed  cat-girl clad in a school uniform, plastered against the canopy  bubble. The deja'vu of the situation didn't go unnoticed by  either corporate officer. Nuku Nuku apparently didn't notice as she  began to head-butt the bulletproof glass, creating a sizable crack on  her second attempt. Nuku Nuku reared her head back for a third strike  when an even larger crash shook the gunship. Arisa turned just in  time to see a blue arc lance through turbofan number two, shredding  half the nacelle and destroying its ability to generate lift. Arisa's  copilot saw it as a mixed blessing. On one hand, the shock knocked  the cat girl off their nose. On the other hand… "Losing power to  number two! <i>We're on fire!"</i></p><p>Ranma  Saotome stared at his handiwork as the aircraft burst into flames. He  hadn't actually meant to hit the damn thing, but then it <i>was</i>  directly in line with the missiles. He was just wondering where the  cat girl went when she fell from her ballistic arc and landed hard,  skidding across the open ground, between the fiancees and strait into  him where her mass carried them fifty more feet before being rudely  stopped by an apartment building wall. Nuku Nuku shook the rubble off  her and stared at her new fiancée, who was also recovering  from the shock. He had caught her! What a nice husband!</p><p>"Reow!"  She twiddled with delight and crushed her fiancée in a hug.  Between a new fiancée, a fiancée cat-girl, the fiancée  wars and a hostile aircraft, Ranma finally snapped as said cat-girl  applied her entire body to the martial artist, purring in the  process.</p><p>The  fiancées had recovered enough of their wits to tear themselves  away from the flaming gunship to the trench created by Ranma and  Nuku, following it back to the pair. Needless to say, none of them  were too pleased by what they found. Akane gaped, finding the newest  fiancée hanging all over <i>her</i> fiancée. "What  the hell do you think you're doing with her, Ranma?" The answer  was unexpected.</p><p><i>"ReeeeeewwwOOOOOWWWWW…."</i></p><p>It  was a testament to Arisa skills as a test pilot that she was able to  put Poison Eight down in one piece, tearing up a Nerima street and  several cars in the process. With Kyouko having cut off fuel to fan  number two, the flaming pylon had been reduced to an angry smolder by  the time the gunship had skidded to a full and complete stop. She  unbuckled her safety harness, only to find Arisa already up and out  of the grounded aircraft.</p><p>"Damn  androids ruined ANOTHER gunship!" She fumed, wrenching a latch and  tearing open the cargo door. She began to pull pieces of composite  armor that vaguely resembled body parts out of the hold. "I will  NOT have another one these come out of <i>my</i> paycheck, dammit!"  She came back into Kyouko's view wearing full power armor, mounting  wrist plasma devices, point defense weaponry on the shoulders and  blisters of mini missiles straddling her ribs and thighs. All and  all, the seven foot tall crimson red suit was quite an intimidating  sight…</p><p>…Almost  as intimidating as the one slinking into a crouch twenty feet from  her. Neko Ranma's eyes glittered as he stalked forward on light  feet, eager to test out the new toy in front of him. What else could  it be? It certainly wasn't human or something that Ranma's cat  brain classified as a friend. It looked too crunchy to be food, which  left only a few options open as to its classification. Arisa gave the  command and the suit unfolded its full arsenal of weaponry. She  watched as her heads up display placed a red glowing ring around  Ranma and locked on. The woman was just about to unlock the safeties  when a pink blur flipped through the air, landing beside the  crouching boy. Neko-Ranma noted his feline friend's displeasure  with the toy in front of him and decided to adopt that displeasure as  his own.</p><p>Despite  the climate controlled power armor, Arisa couldn't help but to  sweat as foot long glowing talons suddenly sprang into existence  along the android boy's hands, while his face took on a countenance  similar to that of their original target. She now had two very pissed  androids facing her… One was insanely strong while the other was  apparently quite well armed… And she only had one suit of armor to  go around. Arisa looked at the irritated expressions on both  cat-androids and nearly cried.</p><p>There'd be nothing left  of her paycheck by the time tomorrow morning rolled around.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma Saotome  stumbled down from the guest room as the dawn's early light  filtered through the Tendo household. He rubbed his temples as his  head throbbed, and he silently wondered how big of a truck hit him  and how fast it was going. He slowly made his way into the living  room, guided only by the smell of breakfast. The martial artists  finally looked up to find his newest fiancée helping Kasumi  set the table.<p>Nuku  Nuku noticed him and broke out into a wide smile. "Good morning  Ranma-san!" she cheered brightly and most last night's adventure  came to the forefront of his memory. He shivered. Not that he  remembered anything after the Neko-Ken, but he distinctly remembered  hitting the attacking aircraft. And Nuku in his arms. After that…?</p><p>He  was about to sit at the table when he noticed Akane's wide eyed  stare. "What?" She remained silent, staring. It was enough to  make him temporarily forget that there was a cat girl across the  table from him scooping double helpings of breakfast onto his plate.</p><p>Nabiki  chuckled and his head swiveled onto her. "She's just recalling  the how you carved up a suit of Mishima Heavy Industries Mk 308  power armor... In addition to one of their elite gunships."</p><p>"You  SAW that?" Ranma asked in disbelief.</p><p>"Of  course." Nabiki confirmed with a smile. "Got it all on tape, too.  I could let you watch the parts you missed for a two thousand yen."</p><p>"Ranma-san  make an excellent husband!" Nuku Nuku piped cheerfully, recalling  the incident clearly. Not only was he a cat, he was undoubtedly an  Alpha male. In short, her feline brain categorized him as the perfect  mate. That statement was enough to snap Akane out of her stupor and  favor her fiancé with yet another smoldering stare. Ranma  didn't even notice as he shook his head in incredulity. The entire  situation had gone from annoying to insane. Fiancees were bad enough.  One that turned into a cat with a curse was a travesty, but a  manageable travesty. One that was a super strong cat-girl all the  time… He shivered again as Nuku Nuku favored him with a fanged  grin. Funny how the panda was nowhere to be found this morning. He  REALLY needed a punching bag today. Ranma noticed the double helping  of food on his plate and produced a weak smile for the cat girl,  whose own smile turned positively incandescent.</p><p>Denied  his normal outlet of aggression when faced with the weird and bizarre  situations created by his father, Ranma turned to the only thing he  had left… Planning his next move against Setsuna. She was <i>so</i>  going to pay.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  crouched on the rooftop and extended his ki sense for a couple of  miles, finally confident that he had shaken off all pursuit. The  normal fiancées had been easy. Shampoo was a bit tougher with  her tracking experience. Ditching Nuku Nuku was positively a  nightmare without the Umi-sen-ken, and he didn't want to use it  while there was the possibility that The Meddler could monitor him or  his friends, as it was truly his ace in the hole. Through careful  experimentation, it was becoming increasingly obvious that that the  Senshi of Time couldn't track his movements directly and had to  resort to monitoring the people around him to discover his  activities. Once he was alone, he could do damn near anything he  wanted without her knowledge. Sure she knew he was up to something.  After all, if finding a few thousand roaches in your own bedroom  didn't tip you off, nothing would. But knowing something was up and  doing something about it were two different things. Unless she wanted  to force a direct confrontation- which would suit him just fine –she  would just have to remain in the dark until he made his move.<p>He  also had a sneaking suspicion that she had no knowledge of his girl  type, which gave him a supreme, if unwelcome tactical advantage.  Ranma wasn't sure exactly why. Maybe it was because he had played  Ranko Tendo so many times as to be overlooked. Maybe it was because  of the magic imbedded within the curse. Maybe she just hadn't put  two and two together like so many other people in his life. Whatever  the reason, it was leverage he couldn't pass up, if only because he  was at his wits end concerning her activities in his life. At this  point, he would take any and every advantage to convince Pluto to  stay off his back, even if it meant time in his female form.</p><p>Regardless,  he couldn't afford "maybe's" or "probably's" if his  next offensive measure was to succeed. He had to know for sure and  that's why he was on this rooftop at this very moment. Ranma pulled  out a small canteen from weapon space and unscrewed the cap.</p><p>It  was game time.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The Senshi of Time  was in a good mood. For one, Crystal Tokyo was holding at a  probability of ninety-seven point one percent, the highest she'd  achieved in several hundred years. Second, her plans to further  complicate Ranma's life were a complete success. Not that she was  done by a long shot, just that she loved it when a plan came  together. This plan had been especially enjoyable, however. Setsuna  Meiou handed a few bills to the grocery store clerk and collected her  bags as she doled back her change. Not only was Ranma now saddled  with a nuisance and phobia, he <i>also</i> had the entire resources  of Mishima Heavy Industries directed against him as well, thinking he  was Doctor Natsume's next  generation humanoid cat robot after Nuku Nuku. Setsuna couldn't  help but to snort with laughter as she exited the grocery store, bags  in hand. The entire situation was priceless. She hadn't had this  sort of fun in at least a century.<p>She  stepped out onto the sidewalk. Had she been paying a bit more  attention, she might have not walked into the path of a fellow  pedestrian, promptly causing the pair to collide with one another.  Setsuna managed to retain her balance though she lost her grip on a  bag. The girl she had run into wasn't quite so lucky, finding  herself deposited butt first onto the pavement.</p><p>"Ow!"  the girl exclaimed then looked up into the green haired woman above  her. "OH! I'm sososososo sorry!" She scrambled to her feet and  retrieved the Senshi's lost bag of food. "Oh my! I hope I didn't  break anything!"</p><p>The  Senshi couldn't help but to smile at the redhead's gushing. "I'm  sure everything is okay. Speaking of which, are YOU okay?"</p><p>"Mmm,  I think so." The redhead answered somewhat indecisively. "Yeah.  I'm okay!" She looked as if she were about to say something else  but then her eyes widened. "Oh no! I'm late!" With that, she  gave a curt bow to the green haired lady and ran off around the  corner.</p><p>Setsuna  couldn't help but to chuckle. The bubblehead would be lucky if she  didn't run down five more people getting to wherever she was going  to.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  watched the Senshi of Time continue on her way from her rooftop  perch, all but invisible courtesy of the sealedUmi-sen-ken  technique. She watched until she was out of site, observing her every  movement and body language. Everything she saw from the encounter up  to now led her to one decisive conclusion… Setsuna Meiou didn't  have a clue as to who she had just run into. Ranma grinned ferally.  With that confirmed and Pluto having vacated the area, Ranma emerged  from the cloaking technique and hopped down to the street below,  picking out a nearby tailor.<p>The woman at the  counter was about forty and the portly sort, one Ranma could easily  associated as being the motherly type. The seamstress adjusted her  thick glasses and smiled at her new customer. "What can I do for  you, Miss?"</p><p>Ranma smiled,  switching back to full bubblehead mode and laid a magazine out on the  woman's counter. I need you to make one of these for me."</p><p>The seamstress  blinked, then smiled. "The full costume?" Ranma nodded,  maintaining her own smile. "You <i>do</i> know you can go to any  store and pick up one of these at a much cheaper rate then I'll  have to charge you…?"</p><p>The redhead in  front of her nodded. "I know, but I need something that looks  <i>absolutely</i> authentic and you came highly recommended." As if  to underscore her point, Ranma pulled out a sizable wad of cash.  Highly recommended by a certain Tendo, who also happened to be her  source of funds. Better the devil you know, Ranma snorted mentally.</p><p>The woman nodded.  "Quite a bit of money for cosplay, but I've seen stranger. I'll  have the full ensemble ready in about a week, is that acceptable?"  The redhead nodded. "Have you decided on a color? If not, I'd say  a dark red and white would match your beautiful hair perfectly."</p><p>Ranma shrugged.  "I've never had much of a fashion sense, so I'll take you word  for it." The two worked out a few other minor details concerning  the design and Ranma left with a mischievous smile on her face.</p><p>One more stop to  make.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Not much happened  around the suburb of Nerima at two AM in the morning, which was why  the shadowy figure chose that time to penetrate the Chinese sanctuary  of the Neko Han Ten. Of course the doors were locked and the noodle  restaurant closed, but that served next to no deterrent to the  shadow, who easily found a way in, slipping quietly through a back  door and into the kitchen. It stalked the premises for a few moments  more before a sound stopped it dead in its tracks.<p>"Ahem." The  shadow turned to find an old woman balanced neatly on a staff as  gnarled as she was. "Do you really think you could sneak around my  home and not be noticed, Son in-law?"</p><p>Ranma stepped out  of the shadows, producing a thin smile. "Not at all. I was counting  on it, in fact." Cologne cocked her head in curiosity. Normally  Shampoo's bride to be didn't operate at quite this level of  subterfuge. "We need to talk. Privately."</p><p>"This isn't  private enough?" Cologne was intrigued now. Breaking and entering  just to talk to her alone?</p><p>The martial  artists shook his head. "No. We need to talk somewhere that can't  be penetrated by… other methods." Cologne arched and eyebrow in  surprise, but nodded knowingly. "Other methods" implied something  beyond Nabiki's routine eavesdropping, and the fact that Saotome  assumed she had just a safe area… Interesting, indeed.</p><p>The Amazon  matriarch led him down to the lower level, past several door and over  to a plain wooden one. Ranma took careful note of it as it was  designed in such a way as not attract undue attention to itself, like  a broom or janitorial closet. The two stepped inside and she closed  it, first locking the deadbolt, then warding it with a complex series  of finger signs. Ranma looked around the bare room, which was  furnished only by a simple table and four chairs. The walls, however,  were plastered with every imaginable warding seal and the pigtailed  boy had no hope of even deciphering a fraction of them.</p><p>Cologne set her  cane aside and took a chair. Ranma did likewise. "This is as  private as I and few other can possibly make it, Son in-law. What is  so important that you feel it necessary to break into my home, wake  me up at two in the morning and seek the refuge of a room such as  this one?" The elder desperately tried to keep her curiosity from  cracking the mask of neutrality she now wore. Truth be told, his  unusual behavior had it eating her alive.</p><p>"Remember the  wishing sword?" Cologne nodded. Unlike Nabiki, she failed to voice  her opinion on the bungled wish, if only aloud. "I got my wish and  found out why my life has been so screwed up."</p><p>Cologne's mask  faltered ever so slightly. The wish had actually proven… useful?  "And what did you find, Son in-law?"</p><p>"That there is  an unwelcome force meddling with my life and those of my friends. I  intend to put a stop to it." Ranma stated evenly and Cologne's  mask slipped further, so much so that she abandoned it completely in  favor of unbridled curiosity.</p><p>"What is this  force? And how do you intend to stop it?"</p><p>Ranma shook his  head. "Right now, the less you know the better. In fact, my biggest  advantage at the moment is the total secrecy concerning my actions in  the matter."</p><p>Cologne frowned.  "Then there is little I can do for you Son in-law. If you cannot  divulge the length and breadth of your operations concerning an  anonymous adversary…"</p><p>Ranma nodded with  understanding. "Right. No offense, but I'm not here to enlist  your help. I'm here to retrieve something of mine."</p><p>Cologne stared  without comprehension. "And what would that be?"</p><p>"The Gekkaja and  the Kinjakan." Ranma's reply was totally devoid of emotion and  this time Cologne truly faltered, as the severity of the martial  artist's plight hit home. She had almost forgotten that the sacred  keys were in her possession, but Ranma obviously had not. In fact, it  was he that took possession of both staffs after the battle against  Saffron. In a rare moment of foresight, he had determined that if  Saffron was to be reborn and attempt another ascension to that of  full Phoenix Godhood, Ranma would hold the keys to that ascension. If  little Saffron failed to meet his expectations of honor and  compassion, the deity stood a snowflakes chance in hell to ever  attaining his true form. And unlike other mortals, it was a demand he  could easily back up. There was virtually no force that the Godling  could bring to bear that would stand against Ranma if he were so  inclined to deny him his power. The Phoenix People hadn't like his  ultimatum one damn bit, but there was also little they could do to  stop him.</p><p>Indeed, it was a  secret honor for Cologne when he remanded the ancient weapon-keys  into her custody. His reasoning was simple—His life was simply too  chaotic to leave such high-powered weaponry lying around the dojo,  especially with so many non-combatants living there. Sure, he and his  father were extremely capable martial artists, maybe Soun too in a  pinch, but he trusted his father as far as he could throw him, while  Nabiki would undoubtedly find their hiding places in no time flat.  He'd be lucky if they weren't pawned off within a week of their  discovery in either case. So Ranma had entrusted them to the one  person he knew who not only could defend them, but was honorable as  well, despite their disagreements as to his future bride would be.</p><p>And now he was  taking them back in response to a mysterious, unseen threat. That  alone spoke volumes on so many levels as to what he was facing.  First, there was the fact that he was actually willing to take up a  weapon against the threat. Second, the weapons he was using could  very conceivably take out a god. Third, he was taking <i>both</i>  weapons, not simply one. Finally, there was the fact that they were  in the very room that would prevent nearly every known form of  surveillance, magical and otherwise. In fact the only thing that  could possibly scry through the warding she had erected was a full  blown god, and Cologne hoped to heaven Ranma wasn't planning on  taking out another one. Those sort of actions tended to get one  noticed by <i>all</i> the wrong parties.</p><p>After that brief  period of thought, the Elder nodded grimly and reached into her own  weapon space, pulling out a small dagger and a rectangular seal. Like  the others, its symbology was completely incomprehensible to Ranma.  His eyes widened as she took the dagger to her tumb and slit it, then  proceeded to drag the minor wound across the paper itself. The blood  soaked in and she chanted something complete intelligible to Ranma.  The effect, however, was obvious. The seal glowed briefly, then lit  into open flame. Within seconds, there was nothing left but ash.  Cologne noticed the shocked expression on the boy's face.</p><p>"Think of it as  a combination locked weapons space." She explained. "Under the  right circumstances, a normal pocket such as the ones Moouse uses can  be forced and broken into. They are unlocked doors that can be  breached. Not easily mind you, but it isn't total security."  Ranma nodded and the elder continued. "This method, however,  require the willing life force of the user. There is virtually no  method by which it can be forced. Even psychological techniques such  as brainwashing are not guaranteed to work."</p><p>With that, Cologne  reached back into weapon space. "High security, eh?" Ranma  commented as she began to draw a thin, silver shaft from thin air.</p><p>"Indeed, Son in-law." The Kinjakan  was first as she set the large, ring-tipped staff onto the table. The  ambient power in the room increased greatly simply through its  presence. Ranma traced the silver shaft and Cologne withdrew the  crescent bladed Gekkaja, lying it across the Kinjakan. The bent blade  of the Gekkaja had annoyed Ranma to no end, so he took it upon  himself to bend it <i>back</i> before storing it with Cologne all  those months ago. Both stared at the accumulation power now sitting  quietly on the table for a moment before Cologne broke the awed  silence. "Do you have a place to keep them?"</p><p>Ranma nodded and stored the ancient  keys into his own weapon space. He addressed Cologne's next  question before it was even asked. "I didn't know the technique  at the time and I need somewhere safe to store them until I did. You  were the best person for the job."</p><p>Cologne accepted the explanation and  sighed. "I hope you know what you're doing, Son in-law." Ranma  stood and walked to the door, breaching their zone of confidentiality  with a turn of the handle. The door opened and he produced a cold  smile.</p><p>"I know exactly what I'm doing.  It's payback time."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's Notes:</b><br/><i>I had fun with this chapter as it  allowed me to deepen the plot and engage in some foreshadowing, not  to mention the insanity that Nuku Nuku will bring to the table. Trust  me, the pissing contest is only just getting started. Since it's  nearly 7am here, I'll cut right to the notes.</i><p>Gekkaja- <i>The crescent tipped staff of  ice Ranma used to help defeat Saffron in book 38. It's primary  power it to turn chunks of matter into solid ice. The original  condition book 38 leaves this weapon in is with the crescent blade  bent at an unnatural 90 degree angle. Ranma had returned it to its  original state before storing it with Cologne.</i></p><p>Kinjakan- <i>The large ring-tipped staff  wielded by both Ranma and Saffron, the latter of which uses this  weapon against Ranma in book 38. Its primary effects are two  fold—First, the ring can be flung at an opponent and will easily  carve through dense material, magically returning to the staff.  Second, it is the polar opposite of the Gekkaja with the ability to  produce mass quantities of fire and heat.</i></p><p>That's all. Hope you liked it and I  can't wait to get started on part three.</p>
