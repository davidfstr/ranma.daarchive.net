Usagi, Ami, Minako and Rei nodded in unison.</p><p>"Don't tell me you  actually believe this claim…?" Haruka rolled her eyes, leaning in  closer to woman with wavy sea-green hair sitting next to her. "Or  don't you remember Sailor Titanium?"</p><p>Usagi's face took on  a pout. "How were we supposed to know she was just a fan?"</p><p>"Oh, let me see…"  The dishwater blonde began to tick the facts of life off on her  fingers. "She couldn't transform, she didn't have any magical  powers, she didn't have a henshin stick and wait, <i>her magical  weapon was a piece of pipe that was spray-painted and sprinkled with  glitter!</i>"</p><p>"But she was nice…"  The girl alternately known as Sailor Moon shuffled, avoiding eye  contact.</p><p>"GrrrRRR…."  Haruka growled in annoyance. Mercury stepped forward to forestall the  potential confrontation building.</p><p>"While we didn't  get to see her transform or unleash a magical attack herself, I can  guarantee you that whatever it is she has for a weapon is <i>not</i>  a pipe with glitter." This seemed to gain a fraction more of the  pair's attention. "The weapon she dispatched five youma with  reeked of elemental magic and the girl herself was lightning fast."</p><p>"What did she look  like?" Makato asked from her seat on the floor.</p><p>"Red shoulder length  hair, blue eyes and a crimson-white fuku." Rei supplied. "About  my height, in fact."</p><p><i>"And the weapon?"</i></p><p>"Eeek!" Usagi  squealed with fright from the unexpected voice behind her, leaping  halfway across the room in the process. Moon whirled around to  confront her tormentor. The woman with long green hair simply favored  her with a neutral stare. "DON'T DO THAT!"</p><p>Michiru smirked and  Setsuna Meiou simply repeated the question as the blonde struggled to  keep from hyperventilating "A staff, just over a meter long with a  detachable bladed ring on one end and a crescent blade on the other."  Ami described the weapon in question and Pluto cocked her head  curiously.</p><p>"And the elemental  magic?"</p><p>"Fire and Ice." She  replied, wary now that something close to an emotion was playing  along the mysterious woman's face.</p><p>The crack in Setsuna's  armor wasn't lost on her best friend either. "What's wrong,  Puu-chan?"</p><p>"Just…" She  stared at the Chibi Usagi, who stared back with rapt curiosity. She  turned back to Ami. "Did you get a picture of it?"</p><p>The cobalt blue haired  girl smirked. "Better than that." She flipped open the Mercury  link and pressed a few keys. Seconds later, a holographic projection  of not only the staff, but its wielder sprang to life in mid air. "I  was so shocked I didn't get much, but that's her and the weapon."  The room's occupants gathered around the hologram, wondering at the  image of Sailor Nova frozen in a striking stance with what looked to  be one wicked looking staff.</p><p>"That's the  weapon?" Haruka asked, her previous resentment loosing a bit of its  edge.</p><p>"I think I'm  jealous." Michiru commented. Her envy wasn't necessarily limited  to just the staff.</p><p>The sharp intake of  breath tore their attention away from the image and focused it  squarely on Pluto. "Puu-chan?" The tiny pink-haired girl asked  tentatively.</p><p>Setuna took a moment to  collect herself. "If I'm correct, we have just received a  substantial boost in firepower." She paused, then in a lower voice,  "And I didn't think any of <i>them</i> made it forward…"</p><p>"You mean this Nova  is <i>for real?</i>" The handsomely dressed blond asked, skepticism  returning to her voice in full force.</p><p>"Quite possibly."  Pluto continued. "While her name doesn't ring any bells, that  weapon was used <i>only</i> by the Queen's elite guard."</p><p>"I thought <i>we</i>  were the Queen's guard?" Hotaru asked, no longer content with  simply watching this new event unfold around her.</p><p>Setsuna nodded. "Today  you are, but back in the Silver Millenium, the Queen was protected by  a full security contingent. You functioned as her sword, as it were,  while the Alpha Guard was her shield. Of course, we can't afford  that sort of luxury at present."</p><p>"She's my  <i>bodyguard?</i>" Usagi asked with wide eyes, hardly able to  believe that she'd rate personal protection.</p><p>"And Small Lady's"  Setsuna nodded once more. She glanced at Chibi Usagi, who was now  uncharacaristically  still, staring at the hologram. "Though to be honest, I'm not  sure how our situation is going to alter that arrangement. Like I  said, we're stretched pretty thin as it is. We can't exactly  afford to tie up somebody with that much firepower on strictly guard  detail."</p><p>"Exactly how much  power are we talking, here?" Rei asked the question that was now on  everybody's mind.</p><p>"To even be  considered for the posting, Alpha Guard candidates had to undergo no  less than ten years of intensive combat and survival training. After  that, a minimum of three years as a protective detail specialist.  After <i>that</i>, they had to pass a full battery of loyalty  screening reviews." Setsuna outlined. "Even after they have been  accepted, the training never stops. Trust me, you do <i>not</i> want  to go through even a fraction of that."</p><p>"That, I can believe."  Usagi stated reverently. "After the five youma…"</p><p>"Hmmf." Haruka  sniffed. "I've taken out ten in a single attack."</p><p>"…Destroying an  entire city block in the process." Rei pointed out, earning her a  menacing glare.</p><p>"You'll have to  forgive us if we don't take her qualifications at face value."  Michiru stated icely.</p><p>"Exactly." Haruka  agreed as she cracked her knuckles. "We'll be <i>more</i> than  happy to establish her bona fides."</p><p>Setsuna's eyes  widened as blurry mass suddenly took shape behind the dishwater  blonde and her partner, solidifying into a female form that consisted  of fiery shoulder length red hair, crystal blue eyes and one mean looking Staff of  Ascension.</p><p>"<i>Is that right?"<hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>If there was one  unwritten rule of villainy Ranma had noticed over the years, it was  that bad guys talked entirely too much. Normally those conversations  followed along the lines of some self-absorbed tirade, or what Ranma  had come to know as the "Why I became a villain" speech. Usually  it was Akane's kidnappers that liberally indulged in this past  time, though Kuno- while not a villain per se –was the  worst offender. How he could go on about "foul sorcerer"  this and "enemy of women" that for a whole hour was beyond the  pigtailed boy's comprehension, but that wouldn't stop him from  using that time constructively. They all seemed to so enjoy so much that  Ranma began to wonder if, in fact, they were contractually obligated  to prattle on so.</p><p>Apparently, The Meddler  had a similarly loose tongue, and Ranma smiled as she listened to the  group from the safety of stealth.</p><p>Sailor Nova's  introduction to the small team of Senshi had been a complete success  and Ranma was proud in how her training had paid off in spades. It  had taken hours upon hours of practice, but the fruits of her labor  resulted in three dead little monster in one shot, while the other  two fell pathetically in melee combat. Sufficiently impressed, she  decided to play the mysterious magical girl role to the hilt and  disappear right in front of them, leaving tons of unanswered  questions. It also provided her with the perfect opportunity to  gather intelligence as they rushed back to inform the others.</p><p>Sailor Nova didn't  have to wait long.</p><p>It  wasn't an hour  later that the group had gathered at the Temple with the other  Senshi, and in their civilian states no less. At that point, Ranma  didn't have a plan beyond playing the mysterious and powerful new  Senshi, but then the meeting got started and Pluto began to spill her  guts. It had taken aquite a bit of restarint not to wring her neck  outright, but somehow she had managed to retain her self control.  besides, she was massively outgunned. Sailor Nova took a fresh look at  her staff. She had known the  thing was old, but <i>that </i>old? Granted, it had belonged to a  self-proclaimed Phoenix God who had been righteously pissed that he  had even <i>touched</i> them, but... Just how long had he  had them in his possession? Hell, what the heck was this 'Silver  Millennium' crap, anyway?</p><p>Nova smiled as Setsuna  Meiou literally helped her rewrite the plan. Sailor Nova, an elite  reincarnated bodyguard? <i>Sure she was!</i> To the Princess? <i>Of  course, of course</i>. Just call me Sailor Bad Ass, thankyouverymuch.  Not only that, but it was exactly the opening she needed. Who better  to cozy up to this Princess than somebody sworn to protect her at all  costs? Sailor Nova cast and evil smile toward Setsuna…And to warn  you of all threats, foreign <i>and </i>domestic.</p><p>Nabiki would have been  proud.</p><p>"You'll have to  forgive us if we don't take her qualifications at face value."</p><p>So not all the Senshi  were oblivious after all, Nova realized, remembering how the other three girls  had de-transformed right outside their own apartment. Whatever. Can't  expect everything to go smooth as glass. That's when she heard her cue.</p><p>"Exactly. We'll be  <i>more</i> than happy to establish her bona fides."</p><p>Sailor Nova took the  opportunity to drop the Umi-Sen-Ken cloak directly behind the two  girls and watched the entire room's eyeballs widen to the size of  dinner plates. Hikaru and Michiru wondered if they had something on  their face for a moment until a voice spoke up behind them.</p><p><i>"Is that right?"</i></p><p>"EeeEP!" both  Senshi instantly jumped across the room, nearly mowing down the rest  of their team in the process. Even through the shock of seeing the  new Senshi for the second time that day, Usagi Tsukino knew irony  when she saw it and tried to suppress a fit of giggling  unsuccessfully.</p><p>"WHAT ARE YOU LAGHING  AT, MEATBALL HEAD!" Haruka fumed as she picked herself off the  floor, thoroughly embarrassed. She couldn't have set the new Senshi  up any better if she tried.</p><p>"Excuse me, but did  you just <i>insult the Princess?</i>" The wording was polite, but  the redhead's tone had the consistency of liquid helium. She took a  step past Usagi, bringing her staff to bear.</p><p>Usagi's laughter died  as if it were cut down with a chainsaw, her eyes returning to their  dinner plate diameter. Her new bodyguard was apparently deadly  serious. "Um, you know, it's okay…" Sailor Nova paused in her  advance. "I mean, it happens all the time."</p><p>"<i>All the time?</i>"  Nova's tone dropped to absolute zero and Moon instantly realized  she had just sentenced Haruka Ten'ou to a painful death.</p><p>Uranus was up now, but  she was mentally sweating bullets behind that tough-as-nails mask.  Not only was Sailor Nova <i>real</i>, but she had just located their  meeting site, infiltrated the structure, seen their civilian  identities and used goddamn <i>cloaking magic</i> to scare the snot  out of her and Neptune. She could even feel the power roll off that  staff of hers, which most definitely was <i>not</i> a pipe coated  with glitter. It took a bit longer than a moment before she gathered  enough wits to speak, desperately trying to match the woman's  demeanor.</p><p>"You don't honestly  think we're going to take your claim at face value, do you?"  Behind her, Michiru rested a mental finger on the panic button that  would transform her to into Sailor Neptune should her partner need  backup.</p><p>A slight smile crossed  the frosty Senshi's features. It held absolutely no emotion. "The  only claim I've made is to break every single bone in your body if  you insult the Princess <i>ever</i> again." She paused, her face  gaining a thoughtful look. "Do you know how many bones are in the  human body?" Usagi paled. It was a reaction mirrored by nearly  everybody else in the room, save one person.</p><p>"HMMffppht…" Moon  and Pluto turned their attention to Chibi, who seemed to be  convulsing uncontrollably. "BWAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAH!" The  massive eruption of laughter smashed the tension between Nova and  Uranus, and all eyes were now on the small, pink haired lady who was  cackling madly. "Oh! Oh! It's too.. too..  BWAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA!" Tears were gushing out of her eyes as she  hit the floor rolling. A sweat drop collectively fell from the  foreheads of the other room occupants.</p><p>"What the…?"  Hontaru wondered, leaning down to the girl giggling uncontrollably  before them.</p><p>Nova stared as well,  her opponent completely forgotten. "Um, is she <i>okay?"</i> the  pink haired girl's fits of laughter seemed to be subsiding and she  opened her eyes. Her gaze fell on Ranma once more and the laughter  continued in earnest. "Riiiight." Sensing that she had somehow  overstayed her welcome, she turned back to Sailor Uranus. "I'll see <i>you </i>later." Then the Senshi reactivated her cloak and was  gone.</p><p>Pluto sensed the change  and found the spot where the new Senshi once stood empty. "Damn!"  The curse seemed to help Chibi rein in her convulsions, though  looking at her green haired friend produced the exact same result as  if she were looking at Sailor Nova herself.</p><p>"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Setsuna Meiou was  thankfully that the bedroom walls were mostly succeeding in drowning  out the Small Lady's incessant laughter. In fact, moving to the  next room was an absolute necessity since catching sight of the green  haired Guardian of Time would repeat the entire process over again;  eliminating any chance that something constructive might be  accomplished concerning Sailor Nova in Chibi's presence.<p>Now on the bed before  her sat two cats, one white and one black. Each bore the marking of a  yellow half moon on their foreheads, and both the only survivors of  the long dead Silver Millennium.</p><p>"Anything?"</p><p>The white cat cast a  slight glance over to the black one at its side, who produced the  feline equivalent to a shrug. Having deferred, Artemis spoke first.  "There is definitely a high level of magic surrounding her, though  it's impossible to tell how much of it is due to the staff."</p><p>Setsuna nodded in  agreement. "The staff is definitely authentic, and from Ami's  description, she knows how to use it."</p><p>"Even her mannerisms  are what I would expect of the Queen's Own." Luna commented. "Had  we been back in the royal court, I would have no doubts that she  would follow through with that promise."</p><p>"She still might."  Artemis quipped, to which the black cat nodded her agreement.  "Regardless of the magical background noise from the staff, there's  no doubt she's very powerful. Have you considered the time gates to  learn more about her?"</p><p>Setsuna frowned. "If  I remember right, that won't be an option." Both cats looked at  her curiously now. "Members of the Alpha were magically sealed to  be untraceable and untrackable."</p><p>"Makes sense." The  black cat concurred. "Wouldn't do to have the Queen herself  traceable through the Elite guarding her."</p><p>"But  the cloaking  magic is definitely something I don't recall." the Senshi added.  "But then, my memories aren't exactly one hundred percent after  I…" her voice trailed off as she remembered the incident in which  she did the one thing she was absolutely forbidden to do on pain of  death: Bring time to a complete stand still. She had done so and the  resulting reincarnation had done wonders for her memory. "Could have  been a secret project for all I know." Luna nodded knowingly,  as did Aretemis. Both had massive holes in their own memories, a side  effect from the stasis and trip forward through time. Likewise, the  remained of the Senshi who had been killed during the holocaust  itself were still struggling to regain theirs.</p><p>Luna looked over at  Artemis. "So, does the name Sailor Nova ring any bells?"</p><p>"Not a one." He  replied, stretching on the bed. "Not that the Alphas were exactly  sociable to begin with."</p><p>"Looks like we're  stuck playing the waiting game then." Setsuna sighed. Like the  future sister in-law of a certain pigtailed martial artist, Sailor  Pluto was a creature that thrived on information. Depriving her of  that sustenance for prolonged periods of time was not only stressful,  but akin to psychological torture. Still, that wouldn't stop her  from asking Ami to take a crack at it with the Mercury Computer.</p><p>"Indeed." Luna agreed. "Speaking of which… What in the <i>world</i>  did you do to Small Lady?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Dusk was claiming the  suburb of Nerima when Ranma Saotome, heir to the Anything Goes School  of Martial Arts and <i>not </i>somebody who had <i>anything </i>to do  with the Sailor Senshi stepped through the gates of the Tendo Dojo.  The precautions he had taken getting back to this point were  enormous, doubling back on himself no less than five times under  cloak before finding a vacant alley to change and return to the dojo  as a guy. Ranma double-checked himself one more time to ensure that  no magical girl gear remained on his person before turning the door  handle and stepping back into his old life.<p>As he walked into the  core of the house, Ranma reflected on his day and considered it  nearly a complete success. Well, almost. Except for that last part  with the insane pink haired girl. Other than that, her appearance at  the temple had gone better than she possibly could have hoped. Not  only had Sailor Nova made a lasting first impression, but she'd  also found a wedge to use against Setsuna. Just how big of a wedge  remained to be seen, but it was better than what she had first  started with.</p><p>Ranma walked into the  living room with a spring in his step, expecting to find Kasumi  fixing dinner. What he found instead was three girls gathered around  the TV, staring at it intently. There was a forth girl, but she was  occupied with a ball of yarn. It was also really bad luck that she  was a cat girl and just happened to be the first to notice him.  "Ranma husband home! <i>Reow!"</i></p><p>Try as he might, Ranma  found it impossible to produce a saving throw versus robotic cat  girls and the glomp landed with ease. Ranma stiffened, but otherwise  remained rooted in place, eyes clenched shut. "…" he repeated the  litany as if it were a life preserver. The martial artist was now  operating solidly under the premise that if he said it enough times,  maybe it would actually come true. The litany continued until  interrupted by Kasumi.</p><p>"Now Nuku-chan, what  did we say about Ranma?"</p><p>Nuku Nuku slowly  untangled herself from Ranma's arm. "Mmmmm… No glomp on Ranma  husband?"</p><p>"Very good." Kasumi  smiled, and the cat girl returned an even brighter one. "What  else?"</p><p>The smile vanished in  favor of a look of intense concentration. "Ranma husband… Is not  a cat?"</p><p>"Excellent." The  smile returned to its previous intensity. "Now come back over here  so that Ranma can relax." Nuku Nuku favored the martial artist with  one last look of adoration before bouncing back over to Kasumi and  the neglected ball of yarn. The pigtailed martial artist cracked an  eye open to find the cat girl safely occupied by the yellow sphere of  thread. Incredible. Simply in-freaking-credible.</p><p>"Uh, thanks Kasumi…"  Ranma managed to push past his near brush with insanity and Kasumi  smiled warmly.</p><p>"Did you hear,  Ranma-kun?" She asked and Ranma gave her a blank look.</p><p>"Hear what?"</p><p>The eldest sister  pointed at the TV, which now showed some sort of firefight in  progress. "There's a new Sailor Senshi…" Kasumi's eyes  sparkled as she turned back to the TV while Ranma's mind raced  furiously.</p><p>Another Senshi? He  thought as he stepped over to the gathering of sisters. I missed  one! Letsee, there's all the planets, The Meddler, the fool in the  Tuxedo… How many could there possibly be—</p><p><i>"And that's when the new Senshi, Sailor Nova  arrived on scene to dispatch the Youma ravaging Juubon with ease. As  you can see here from Channel Seven's exclusive footage, this  beautiful Guardian wastes no time dispensing justice…"</i></p><p>"Erk!" The trio  turned around to find Ranma white as a ghost.</p><p>"So what do you  think, Ranma-kun? A new Senshi!" Kasumi gushed. "It looks like  I'll have to update my collection soon. How about you?"</p><p>The martial artist  twitched, staring at a close-up of the redhead on TV. "Er… Just  another stupid magical girl?"</p><p>"Are you kidding?"  Akane blurted practically in his face now. "Have you seen the way  she moves? She's the Ultimate Magical Pretty Youma Killing  Guardian of Love and Justice!" Ranma's cheek had now developed a  nervous tick as he looked from Akane to Kasumi to Nabiki, then back  to Akane. "I've GOT to get me one of those staves!"</p><p>"It is quite  imposing." Kasumi commented. "Still, I think Sailor Moon is the  best one of the team. After all, this Sailor Nova might have the same  problem Tuxedo Kamen had."</p><p>"HA!" Akane was now  fully engaged in the debate, allowing Ranma to inch away. Slowly. So  very<i>, very</i> slowly as not to attract attention. "That was  because he is a man and all men are perverts. Like those Starlights.  Anyone can see that Sailor Nova is <i>nothing</i> like <i>them</i>."</p><p>A very large sweat drop  rolled off Ranma's forehead.</p><p>"Come on, Akane,"  Nabiki tilted her head. "Even you have to admit Tux is kinda cute.  Dark and mysterious… Probably rich too."</p><p>Kasumi looked at her  sister. "How do you know?"</p><p>"The tuxedo." She  replied. "You don't get that quality at rental stores."</p><p>"No way." Akane  stated flatout. "Believe me, I know perverts when I see them. I  mean, what kind of guy throws roses at his opponents?" Nabiki and  Kasumi looked at one another with realization.</p><p>"Kuno."</p><p>Akane folded her arms in smug self-satisfaction. Both sisters  shrugged and Ranma took that as his cue to exit before things got any  weirder. He looked at the continuing news update on the TV. Or worse.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sailor Pluto was  getting worried. She adjusted the gates to another timeframe and  frowned. Where was that boy! She flicked the staff horizontally and  the view from the gates showed Crystal Tokyo in all its glory…  Which now stood a thirty eight point three chance of becoming a  reality.<p><i>Ranma Saotome.</i></p><p>The name left a bitter  taste in her mouth, and she returned to her searching. He really  wasn't deserving of it, but it had to be done. She knew why he was  the way he was. Intimately, in fact, but the fact was that it was  either him or Crystal Tokyo. It's either kill you, nullify you or  doom humanity. And where was he now? Fiancee number one? No. Two? No.  Three? No. The cat girl? Negative. The Lost Boy? Damn it. The  Amazons? Nope. Setsuna was getting frustrated. Maybe the insane girl?  Not there either. Her brother? Talking to some tomboy pigtailed girl.  Damn, damn, damn! Where was the chaos ridden upstart?</p><p>Setsuna Meiou paused,  calming herself. It didn't matter. He'd return to the dojo  eventually. And when he did, she'd be waiting. The Guardian of Time  made preparations to unleash her version of a tactical nuclear weapon  and focused the gates on one Makoto Kashiwagi.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Well maybe they have  some in this place." Akane theorized, pulling the redhead into a  different a different store.<p>Ranma sighed. "Come  on, Akane. They only found out about her yesterday. They ain't  gonna have nothin' out yet."</p><p>"And how would you  know?" Akane ask sharply.</p><p>"Because even the  merchandizing around Sailor Titanium didn't hit the stores until at  least two weeks…" Ranma noticed Akane taking an unusual interest  in his explanation. "Um… Not that I follow that stuff or nothin'"</p><p>"Right." Akane  snorted. "Pervert."</p><p>Ranma shook her head  and was about to follow her in when her progress was interrupted by a  certain insane kendoist. "Pigtailed girl!"</p><p>Ranma froze. Dammit, I  just can't catch a break today, can I? "Alright, what is it,  Kuno?"</p><p>"I just wanted to  offer my enthusiastic congratulation on your new posting." Kuno  elaborated in his usual flower manner. "It is surely one befitting  of a woman as vibrant and energetic a yourself."</p><p>Akane rejoined the  pair. "New posting?"</p><p>"But of course!" He  exclaimed. "Could it be that the radiant Tigress Akane douth not  know that the Pigtailed Goddess has been accepted by thy beautiful  guardians of Love and Justice to become Sailor Nova?"</p><p>Ranma's face totally  drained of blood as he looked at Kuno in disbelief, then Akane, who  stared at Kuno with a quizzled expression on her face. It took her a  moment to get the words out. "Ranma? A Sailor Senshi?"</p><p>"Indeed it is the  truth! It could be none other."</p><p>Akane looked at him a  moment longer. "AH HAHAHAHAHAHHA!" It was the second time in  so many days Ranma watched a girl erupt into uncontrollable laughter.   "Ranma…! A-A-A Sailor Senshi! WAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"</p><p>"Well its not THAT  unbelievable." Ranma grumbled under her breath while Kuno was more  than slightly taken back.</p><p>"Verily, I can see  where such a prestigious title would invoke considerable jealousy."  Kuno commented and Akane's laughter abated slightly.</p><p>"Jealous?" Akane  asked. It was a rhetorical question. "Of <i>Sailor</i> Ranma?  BWAHAHAHAHAHA!"</p><p>Both redhead and  Kendoist stared after the cackling girl as she waded deeper into the  mall, now oblivious to them both. Kuno broke the moment first.  "Perhapse it is for the best that only one shall date my  magnificence at a time."</p><p>Ranma tried her best to  hide the urge to dispose of his body in a most gruesome manner, since  there was still work to be done. After that, <i>then</i> she could  dispose of his body. The pigtailed girl activated  "pretty-please-Ranma-with-extra-cute-don't-you-just-love-me-with-sprinkles-on-top"  mode and smiled brightly at the upperclassman.</p><p>It was time for the  Ranma Saotome Anything Goes School of Payback, Step Two.</p><p>"Oh, Sempai I would  love to date with you!" Kuno's eyes lit up upon hearing this  most magnificent piece of news. "But for now, I cannot!"</p><p>"And why is this? Is  it not the foul Saotome that keeps your heart enslaved so?" His  voice burned with resentment.</p><p>"Oh no, that's not  it at all!" Ranma countered sweetly. So sweetly that honeybees  would have wretched. "But since I have become a Guardian of Love  and Justice, my superior insists that any man that would take my hand  must measure up to her standards."</p><p>"Truly? Who is this  woman that I must date in order to prove my worth?" Kuno pressed,  heedless of the troubled waters he was sailing into.</p><p>"I don't know if I  should tell." Ranma played coyly. "She has very high standards  and demands her suitors to wear a suit and dark sunglasses at all  time!"</p><p>"Hmmf!" he  dismissed the minor detail. "It is a fashion I shall adapt to  easily in order to win your hand. What is this maiden's name?"  Ranma never stopped smiling throughout the entire exchange, but  Tatewake failed to notice the feral turn it had developed.</p><p>"Would you like her  address too?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sailor Mercury tapped  furiously at the clamshell Mercury Computer link. Furiously, because  she was standing right smack dab in the middle of a all out youma  incursion. "I think I've got a lock on the gate they used this  time!"<p>Venus went on the  offensive, her Love Me Chain slicing a youma clean in two. "That's  great, <i>really</i> great!" she fumed indignantly. "Now put that  thing away and give us a hand!"</p><p>"<i>Shabon spray!"</i>  A glittering misted blew past the complaining blond, shredding the  youma creeping along her flank back twenty feet and into a nearby  building.</p><p>"Show off."</p><p>The situation wasn't  like their last engagement; the one where Sailor Nova had arrived to  boister their numbers. No, this situation was much worse. The hideous  grayish-pink youma had poured out of the flickering porthole en mass  and now the Senshi were outnumbered twenty to five. No, make that  eighteen to five, Sailor Venus amended, giving the two  dispatched monsters a final look before wading back into the target  rich environment.</p><p>A golden yellow arc  streaked past her head and into a wayward youma, and her first  thought was of the Senshi they could so desperately use help from  right about now. No, that wasn't a burning disk of death, Minako  realized. Sailor Moon jumped in beside her to recover the tiara that  had all but gutted another wayward demon. They were all making good  headway, but they knew this attack was different, evidenced by the  fact of a very large youma standing in the center of the  mob. Rei had taken a pot shot at it earlier with a Soul Fire attack,  earning her one irritated super-youma, who in turn directed more of  the lesser youma at her specifically. After that, the Senshi's tactics  were altered by Ami—Don't attack the big one until the fodder was  cleared out first.</p><p>Another Youma fell as  the frail looking Senshi with midnight blue hair ran it through with  perhapse the only weapon that would match Sailor Nova's staff in  terms of sheer exoticness. Saturn pulled the Silence Glave from its  newest victim, panting. She had lost count of how many more there  were to go. Not that she had much time to count as another one clawed its way toward her…</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma Saotome watched  the battle rage from a nearby rooftop. Yep, the Guardians of Love and  Justice were up to the necks in it once again, simply ripe to be  bailed out. Of course, they were probably hoping Sailor Nova would  show up and lend her own brand butt kicking to their little war down  there, but not this time. This time somebody else would be paying  them a visit.<p>The martial artist  unbound his pigtail and a mane of black hair flow wildly in the  windy night. From the breast pocket of his black business jacket, he  withdrew a pair of intimidating black sunglasses. Ranma slid them on and  straitened the matching black tie that contrasted against the white shirt before pulling a bokken from  weapons space.</p><p>There was no doubt... He made this look <i>good.</i></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>One moment, Sailor Mars  was ass deep in youma and the next, a dark blur accompanied by a  flowing blue line erupted around her, decimating the ranks of  monsters in front of her. Body parts flew as the quasi-female demons  were dismembered before her very eyes, shocking both groups into  breaking contacts by mutual consent. Left in the center of the  neutral zone was one of the most handsome men the Senshi had ever laid  eyes on, clad in in black business suit, white shirt, tie and pitch  black shades. Even  Usagi, who was hung up on Tuxedo Kamen had to agree that he looked  positively scrumptious.<p>He flipped the glowing  blue blade around on reflex and turned back toward the enraptured  Senshi, flashing warm smile. If it weren't for the youma behind  him, the girls would have melted right there on the spot.</p><p>"My apologize fair  maidens if I hath startled you." The suit clad avenger apologized  in smooth, modulated tones. "However I cannot abidith by such wicked  magics any longer, especially when used against such visions of beauty  as yourselves." The Senshi's eyes sparkled collectively. So  romantic! The suit now turned to the remaining youma, numbering  thirteen strong. "The vengeance of heaven is slow, but sure.  Unfortunately for you, I'm not. Prepared to have thy ass kicked!"</p><p>The elder youma  frowned, its semi-feminine voice grating through the night air. "And  just who the hell are you, exactly?"</p><p>The person in question  raised his glowing sword high. "I am the Terror that cuts through  the night! I am the defender of Love and virtue! I… <i>am Prince  R!"</i></p><p>The girls jaws dropped  in unison. "Sugoi!"</p><p>The larger youma ground  its fangs down. "Then that's what they'll place on you  tombstone… Assuming there's enough left of you! ATTACK!" The  lesser youma responded to the command instantly, all twelve attacking  simultaneously. Instead of leaping out of the way or dodging the  attacks, Prince R simply stood their oozing confidence. The girls  weren't even worried. Their claws raked in and at the last possible  second, 'R' whipped the bokken through a spiraling frenzy that decimated the attacking force. More body parts were forcibly  separated from their bodies in a most violent manner and the glowing  shaft of power sliced through the last one twenty seconds later. The  elder youma took a step back, it's bony mane quivering with  trepidation.</p><p>Prince R inspected the  remains before turning the point of the glowing wooden sword on the  last survivor. "I would have a word with you foul creature. Thou  thinkth thy can dispoil such ethereal beauty and live? Nay, I cannot  allow such!"</p><p>Unlike the other youma,  this particular beast had actually been genetically engineered to  think, albeit in a limited manner. Still, it was a virtual genius  compared to its smaller brethren. That small intelligence provided  the youma with two options. Fight or escape. It's limited bandwidth  brain considered the two and decided it had virtually no chance to  escape. When coupled with its natural predatory instict, the correct  path became crystal clear.</p><p>"<i>ROOOWWWWRrrroOOOLLL!"</i></p><p>As before, the Prince  remained perfectly calm until the elder youma was virtually on top of  him. In that moment, he planted the blade into the earth and flipped  skyward on the handle. From there, physics did the rest as the  charging beast flew headlong into the blade's glowing blue edge with  enough momentum to run it all the way through. Ranma landed behind  the creature and pulled the blade from the ground. The monster took  its last breath and split cleanly in half along its entire length  before disintegrating into ether.</p><p>Prince R took the  measure of his decomposing opponent before rewarding the awestruck  Senshi with another melting smile. "While I have enjoyed thy  company immensely, I must depart for the night. Fairwell maidens of  Love and Justice!" With a final bow, the new Prince departed at bluring  speeds, leaving five smitten Sailor Senshi in his wake.</p><p>…While somewhere else  in Juuban, <i>another</i> bokken wielding Prince clad in a similar  black suit and glasses began to stalk Setsuna Meiou for the right to  date one pigtailed goddess.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's Notes;</b>  For those of you who have been asking (and none of you have), I think  the theme song for this entire series should be "Hang On" by <i>Smash Mouth</i>.
