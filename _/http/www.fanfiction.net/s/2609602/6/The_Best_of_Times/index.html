</div><p><b>The Best of Times...</b><br/><i>By Ozzallos</i><br/>A  Fukufics (dotcom) Production</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sorry about all the alerts. FFnet crashed and it didn't look like the chapter was being added.<hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Part Six</b><p>"<b>M</b>eow!"</p><p>Ranma froze while Nabiki and Akane paused in their  walk into town. They both looked at Nuku Nuku who shrugged. Well if  she hadn't meowed… They followed Ranma's gaze to the orange  tabby in his path now staring at him. Beads of sweat began to spring  forth from his forehead.</p><p>"Ranma?"</p><p>The martial artist in question ground his teeth  together. <i>Runawayrunawayrunaway runaway…</i> Instead, he took a  strained step forward. "NO!" he glared at the feline, who cocked  its head indignantly. Ranma's breathing began to quicken. "You  think you're hot shit, don't you? Well you're NOT! Your ain't  nothin', you scrawny little thing! You think you're something? I  gotta deal with cat girl FIANCEES! Huh! How about that?"</p><p>The cat blinked.</p><p>"IS THAT RIGHT?" A contorted expression took  over his facial features. "You wanna go? Oh, we'll go alright!"  Ranma unclenched his hand and a blue glow rippled along his knuckles.  Akane stared at it with wide eyes, unable to believe what it  represented. Ranma didn't even look like he noticed "I know what  hell is and you ain't no cat-fiancée!"</p><p>"Um, Ranma…" Nabiki stepped up to his side  with trepidation as Akane watched in horror. "It's just a cat,  Ranma. It can't understand you." Ranma's head swiveled over to  Nabiki, then back to the cat in question, who apparently got bored  and began to walk off.</p><p>"Oh, that's right! You BETTER run!" Ranma  snarled. "If you want some more, you know where to find me!" He  watched his personal personification of evil round the corner out of  sight, then began to grumble something about the cat's questionable  linage. Nabiki simply shook her head and Akane continued to stare  until a nice old lady stepped out onto the sidewalk from her  apartment building and promptly drenched him with water.</p><p>Somehow, it was enough to bleed away the excess  hatred, causing her to grumble about the curse instead. The redhead  was so oblivious that she didn't notice the next in a long line of  tormentors. Makoto Kashiwagi caught up with the trio and took her  place at Ranma's arm without hesitation.</p><p>"<i>Hi</i> Ranma…" She said sweetly. It  wasn't a patented Amazon glomp, but the circumstances more than  made up for that deficiency, in so far that Ranma (a babe) now had  Mako-chan (another babe) hanging off her arm. Further exacerbating  the matter was the fact that Mako-chan just happened to have the  equipment of a guy and girl… So did Ranma, of course, just he did  it on time share. She <i>didn't</i>.</p><p>"Me too!" The bubbly cat girl, decided to join  in the fun that her fiancée was obviously having, and latched  onto the other arm. If Amazon glomping were a scored event, Nuku Nuku  would have rated an 8.2. By now Ranma was turning into a mass of goo,  not so much because of the total hotties hanging off his arm, but by  the peril they represented. On one arm, a phobia that made normal  cats seem pretty insignificant. On the other, a biological concept  she was in no mental condition to deal with.</p><p>Not that the passers-by ogling at the three had  any perverted fantasies involving a certain lesbian trio, a disco  ball and a tub full of warm cheese whiz, no sir.</p><p>Akane didn't even have a chance to glow with  envy as Ranma's other two fiancées happened across the five  girls. Their reactions however, were night and day. Ukyo sized the  three up, her eyes instantly locking on to the long haired brunette.  "Another fiancée?" She wasn't happy about it, but the  fact that it was beginning to happen on a weekly bases helped blunt  any searing jealousy she might have felt. Shampoo, however, was a  different story.</p><p>"Stupid cat-girl stop hanging off Airen  husband!" The purple haired Amazon demanded. Nuku Nuku rose to the  challenge.</p><p>"Nuku-Nuku was here first!" She retorted,  sticking her tongue out at Shampoo. The result was predictable.</p><p>"Obstacle is for killing! <i>Kachu Tenshin  Amagurikan!"</i></p><p>"Nuku Nuku <i>PUNCH!"</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>Ranma prayed silently and braced for impact.</p><p>Across the city in the district of Juuban, a  similar scene was being played out, but with a different cast of  characters.</p><p>"Come my Ethereal Green-haired Beauty! We  shall- urk!" The fist connected with his gut just as Kuno wrapped  his arms around his newest obsession. The upperclassman folded as  Setsuna drew upon a fraction of her Senshi strength to dissuade the  deranged boy.</p><p>"DIE ALREADY!"</p><p>"I see now why… the vibrant pigtailed goddess…  looks to you..." Kuno labored as he struggled upright. "Your  energetic manner… Is no doubt… An expression of your love for  me!"</p><p>Setsuna was about to commence beat down, stage two  on the suited boy when a haunting laugh interrupted her abuse. "<i>OH  HOHOHOHOOOHHHOHOO! </i>Now you will suffer, Harlot!"</p><p>Without summoning her armor, ninety nine percent  of the Senshi's abilities were locked away, awaiting conscious  activation so that the user could interact normally with the  populace, and not accidentally vaporize of few square blocks of  people. But when you had a few thousand years on your hands, you tend  to learn a thing or two about your equipment. Setsuna Meiou just  happened to have such time on her hands and hacked her fuku armor to  the point where she could access ten percent of that power without  having to fully transform. It was probably why Kuno hadn't gone  down after the first few Dead Screams, but now it contributed to her  speed as she removed herself from the path of the ribbon that cut in,  which wrapped itself around Prince R's neck and hauled him away  into a brick wall.</p><p>Setsuna spun around to face her attacker even as  Prince R peeled away from the wall, having left a good impression  with it. Her newest opponent was a girl in her late teens with long  black hair, clad in a black rose embroidered leotard and an insane  glint in her eyes. The girl seemed to take the demise of her brother  in stride. "I shall enjoy punishing you for defiling my  Ranma-sama!"</p><p>Setsuna almost missed the next attack as the name  hit her like a bludgeon… Which just happened to be what Kodachi  Kuno had thrown at her. The Senshi of Time neatly sidestepped each  gymnastics pin and pieces began to snap into place. The roaches she  could have dismissed as a one-off prank or luck. After all, she had  been the Guardian of time now for several millenia and was well  practiced in hiding in the shadows of history and world events. Those  individuals that were too disruptive to the Crystal Tokyo outcome  were removed, and those that couldn't be removed were neutralized.  There were very few that fell in the latter category and those that  did had to be handled with care.</p><p>Ranma Saotome was just sort a person. Anybody she  couldn't eliminate outright normally possessed considerable potential  to do good or evil, but paranoia was an inherent element in her line  of work. Yes, it would be nice to try and turn them to good, but it  was normally far more trouble than it was worth and the tactical risk  to her and Crystal Tokyo were enormous. Setsuna Meiou couldn't  jeopardize actually revealing herself and her mission to these  powerful individuals who may or may not decide to like her, so after  several centuries of moral dilemma and a few good intentions gone  bad, Sailor Pluto decided to take the safer- and easier -of the  options.</p><p>Only today that was turning out not to be the  case.</p><p>Another ribbon snapped in front of her and she  absently deflected it. It was now the first time in nearly a thousand  or so years that one of her projects seemed to have not only  acknowledged her existence, but was actively trying to counter her  influence! The last had been an Amazon named Tieu Shu some one  thousand five hundred years ago, but she had arranged for <i>that one</i>  to be eliminated before she could become <i>too </i>troublesome. But  Ranma... Ranma was going to be a problem. Setsuna closed the distance  and stepped inside the insane girl's guard- Kodachi, if she  remembered correctly -and delivered a right cross to the face,  sending her sprawling twenty feet.</p><p>Ranma was going to be a serious problem. While she  hadn't been able to obtain constant surveillance of his life due to  the chaos surrounding him and his family, she knew him quite well.  Probably better than most of the people he came into contact with,  and one thing was for certain... <i>He would not give up</i>. Against  somebody possessing his determination and power, she saw the  situation getting quite ugly, quite fast. In fact, Setsuna was  slightly surprised that this was the extent of it so far.</p><p>"Cease your pursuit of my Ranma-sama, Witch!"</p><p>"I strike to date thee!"</p><p>"<i>AAAHHHHAAAaaaaAAHHH!"</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>Hotaru fidgeted. This action was strange in itself  because Saturn's Senshi was quiet and reserved to the extreme. In  other words, the girl with short, midnight blue hair was normally not  one to fidget. She, along with the rest of the Senshi, had their eyes  on two people. The first was Yumei Ikari, who looked as if she had  just finished running a 5k marathon. Obviously the Senshi hadn't had  time to 'freshen up' as it were before the meeting now being held at  the Outer's home. The second anomaly was Setsuna Meiou, who was in  very much the same condition. They look like they'd been run over by  a truck, with minor scrapes and bruises accompanying each. It was  Setsuna who looked worse for the wear since she hadn't had a chance  top change out of her purple business casual dress, which was now  looking just this side of tattered.</p><p>"Mmm, are you okay?" Usagi asked Yumei-Ranma  tentatively. The redhead shrugged.</p><p>"Bad hair day."</p><p>"How about you?" Michiru put a similar  question to Setsuna.</p><p>"<i>Very</i> bad hair day."</p><p>...Which was an understatement, since both looked  like they just got licked by a drooling cow. Yumei and Setsuna  offered one another quizzled glances before both began to chuckle at  the other for entirely different reasons. "Okay, enough on our  fashion Faux Pas. Ami, I found what you were looking for." All the  room now focused on the Guardian of Time. "It wasn't easy. They  buried that pocket universe so dimensionally deep that I would have  never found it without your readings from the portholes themselves."</p><p>"Somebody's going through a lot of trouble to  hide this place then..." Haruka almost growled.</p><p>"Yes. Not simply hide it, mind you." Setsuna  continued. "I can't even teleport in to have a look around.  Somebody also went through a lot of trouble to keep people <i>out.</i>"</p><p>"How so, Puu-chan?" Chibi Usa asked, the ever  present smirk that seemed to have been inhabiting her face as of late  seemed to fade.</p><p>"Not only did they bury it dimensional from  sight- my sight -which is notoriously hard to do, but the subspace  strata around it has been folded to such a degree that it might as  well be an origami swan. If I tried to teleport in, I'd probably end  up one too."</p><p>"Use the youma gates, then?" Yumei-Ranma's  tactical mindset was now hard at work. It was an interesting duality,  she observed as her thoughts chewed on the problem. On one hand she  was actively infiltrating the Senshi to oppose Setsuna's meddling. On  the other, her code as a martial artist wouldn't even come close to  letting her stand idly by while the world got invaded by soul  stealing beasts.</p><p>Ami fielded the question. "It's a thought, but  the problem there is we can only react to their presence, not predict  when and where." Yumei nodded in understanding. "By the time we  arrive, the gate is closed and decaying."</p><p>"Then we make out own." The redhead stated  evenly and now the whole room stared at her.</p><p>"And how in the hell do you propose to do that?"  Haruku asked. No hostility in her voice, uh-uh.</p><p>"Beats me." Yumei smiled and half the room  face planted into the floor. Ami, however, was already hard at work,  tapping furiously at the Mercury link.</p><p>"It's possible..." She replied, much to  everybody's surprise. Even Yumei blinked, surprised that her shot in  the dark had produced something tangible. "Not with the information  I have now, mind you... but get me a few more solid readings readings  and I might be able to coax the Mercury Computer into generate our  own."</p><p>"I was about to say that." Yumei deadpanned,  and have the room snorted with something close to laughter.</p><p>"We still need to know what's on the other  side." Rei pointed out, to which everybody agreed.</p><p>"We need a probe." Ami stated, to which her  sisters in arms simply stared. "You know, something expendable  thrown into the pocket universe that will send us back data."</p><p>Setsuna arched an eyebrow. "Like...?"</p><p>"Um," Ami scratched her cobalt blue hair  sheepishly. "Do we happen to have another Mercury link?"</p><p>The remainder of the meeting outlined the various  strategies and such to be employed against further mass youma  incursions and all came to the unwelcome conclusion that they would  be pulling overtime until they could find out what was causing the  things to spew forth from a pocket universe, when the last of their  great adversaries was supportively dead. As it turned out, Pluto did  have a spare link, though she winced at the thought of using a  priceless and near extinct artifact from the Silver Millennium as an  expendable probe.</p><p>But for now, there was other business to take care  of.</p><p>"We may have a problem besides the youma."  Setsuna informed the girls quietly. Attention was instantly riveted  on her person. "It has come to my attention that there is a force  swaying the Crystal Tokyo outcome." The room instantly came to high  alert. Earth was going to suffer a cataclysmic ice age and now  something was threatening humanity's only hope for survival? "There  is an individual in Tokyo who is the source of so much chaos that it  may be necessary to... Remove him from the picture if Crystal Tokyo  is to survive."</p><p>"Um, who is this person?" Makoto asked  quietly. If it hadn't been her, it would have been somebody else.  There was, however, one person in the room who knew exactly who the  Guardian was talking about and she fought the urge to tear into her  right then and there. Yumei-Ranma could probably take three to four  of the girls out before she went down, but she held no illusions as  to the fact that she was seriously out gunned. Not enough space to  pull 'em all into a Hiryu Shoten Ha either, she noted grimly. That,  and she wasn't sure if she <i>wanted</i> to... Her beef was with The  Meddler, not these girls who seemed nice enough by themselves. Still,  something was going to have to be done to head this off at the pass.  <i>Maybe...</i></p><p>"I can kill him now if he's a threat to the  Princess." Yumei-Ranma stated in an almost conversational tone, and  half the other Sailor's eyeballs practically rolled out of their  sockets. Even Setsuna, who had broached the topic was taken back at  her directness. <i>Definitely</i> Alpha Guard. She did <i>not </i>want  to get on that woman's bad side.</p><p>"What?" Usagi stood up suddenly. "We can't  just go around killing people!" The Inners nodded in agreement  while the Outers simple stared at Setsuna now. "Nobody will be  killing anybody until we learn more about him, is that clear?" Nods  came from all around because it was one of the few times the Princess  actually asserted her will upon those around her. Yumei smiled  inwardly. Not so simple when you don't use a sanitary word like  'remove' is it, Set<i>-chan?</i></p><p>With that topic out of the way, the meeting  descended into the usual grab for food, gossip and other teenage  female activities that Ranma really wanted no part of but was  invariably sucked into.</p><p>"What do you think about my hair like this?"  Makoto asked while maneuvering her hair with her hands to mimic a  style.</p><p>The other girls around her were evaluating what  Makoto was proposing, when Yumei piped up. "I think you would  look better if you did it like Hikaru Utada," she said  off-handedly. "It would frame your face better."</p><p>It was after those words left Ranma's mouth that  she realized that she'd been reading way to much of her own teen  magazine stash. <i>Gotta focus on business!</i></p><p>"Your Highness, a word if I may?" Yumei  beckoned the blond into a more private conversation. Usagi looked at  her nervously as she approached, but accepted the invitation. After  all, it wasn't often somebody offered to kill for you without a  second thought. As unnerving as that fact was, she <i>did</i> like  the redhead, especially given the fact that she hadn't heard an  insult directed at her person in nearly a week. "I would only take  the action if it were a direct threat to you." Yumei assured her.</p><p>"I understand, but it's so..."</p><p>"Harsh?" Yumei nodded. "It's not something I  relish either, Princess. Which brings me to what I wanted to talk  about." Moon looked at the redhead curiously now. "As you know,  it's my job to protect you against any threat; Both external and...  <i>Internal.</i>"</p><p>"Internal? <i>You mean...</i> But who?" The  blond's eyes widened at the implication.</p><p>"How well do you know Pluto?" Yumei asked, and  Usagi's eyes widened more, if possible.</p><p>"Um, well... She's nice... But mysterious."  the girl recalled the major aspects of Pluto's personality. "Wish  she was around more to help us out instead of appearing and  disappearing at random. And she's always scaring me!" Usagi's face  took on a mask of annoyance with that last comment.</p><p>Yumei nodded with sympathy. "It's your call as  to how private you wish this information is to remain, but I am  beginning to consider Setsuna Meiou a risk to the throne." Usagi  gasped. "And this latest incident doesn't help matters."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Ranma had now been around the Senshi enough to  know what Crystal Tokyo was and what Pluto's exact motivations were  concerning it. Then everything fell into place with her proclamation  that Ranma was a threat to that vision, which gave her more leverage  than she could have possibly hoped for. "I believe Setsuna has  become too... <i>trigger happy </i>in her quest for Crystal Tokyo."</p><p>"But... <i>how?</i>" She was whispering now,  becoming an active part of the conspiracy in play.</p><p>"Thousands of years with only one single focus  would be my guess." The redhead theorized. "How easy would it be  to rationalize the lives of a few thousand people who may or <i>may  not</i> be disruptive to her plans? Maybe not immediately, but I  imagine after a few thousand years..."</p><p>It had never been put in that context before and  Usagi found herself easily seeing the potential problem. "And to  have the power of all time in the hands of one individual..."</p><p>Yumei-Ranma nodded. "Now you see my fears,  m'lady? What do you suppose she would do if one of your best friends  was a threat? Would she even inform you? Has she <i>ever?" </i>In  that moment, Usagi realized the cold, hard, truth... <i>No, she'd  never know.</i> Pluto's guardianship of time had been her imminent  domain, and she felt neither the want or need to explain her actions  in many cases. It was all very frightening when put into Yumei's  context. "I can't say as to her current behavior, but I find it  disconcerting that she would use the Senshi- <i>her Princess</i> -to  carry out what amounts to an assassination with nothing more than the  promise that he is a threat to Crystal Tokyo."</p><p>"So what do you think I should do?" Usagi  whispered in a quiet voice, one reserved for the realization that all  was not quite right with the world as she knew it.</p><p>"Just watch and observe. Awareness is enough,  your Effervescentness... For now." Ranma stated, then turned her  attention to the next matter at hand- The covert application of a  certain Happosai attractant powder made by a certain Amazonian Elder  to be added to a certain meddler's panty drawer.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><i>Setsuna Meiou, heir quinary</i> <i>in  line to the throne of Pluto did so love Her Majesty's royal balls.  While some of the nobles she mingled with were very much eye candy,  most had the personality of a space flotsam. No, it was the dancing  she enjoyed most of all, not the social life. This particular ball  was a tad different from the others, in the fact that she had not had  to cajole her way into it. Being fifth in line for any throne tended  to put you at the bottom of the invitation list concerning the  Queen's social gatherings, so one had to be creative to even attend  even a fraction of them. </i><p><i>Princess Setsuna was </i>very <i>creative.</i></p><p><i>She reflected on this anomaly as she waited for  the next dance to begin, absently hoping she didn't get stuck with  yet another insufferable noble with too many pedigrees to count.  Unlike the previous dances she had gone to, Setsuna had actually been  </i>invited <i>to this one. It came as somewhat of a shock to have  the written invitation in her hands, signed by the queen herself.</i></p><p>"<i>Excuse me, Princess?" Setsuna looked up to  find a smartly dressed blond with the hint of a smile on his face.  Not bad, she thought as she rose to politely take his hand. Almond  completion, sharp features and easy on the eyes. She smoothed out her  lavender ballroom gown in preperation for the next dance.</i></p><p>"<i>I'd be delighted to." She answered the  unspoken question, only to watch the slight smile turn into a frown.</i></p><p>"<i>I'm sorry, Princess, there appears to be a  misunderstanding." Setsuna blinked. Well if he wasn't here to  dance... "The Queen requests your presence in her chambers." The  Princess studied the room carefully now, noting for the first time  that Queen Serenity was indeed not present as courtesy normally  dictated. Seeing comprehension in her eyes, the blond's minute smile  returned. "If you will follow me, m'lady?"</i></p><p><i>Part of the Princess was disappointed she'd be  missing out on one of the most treasured things in her life...  Dancing. The other part- fortunately the majority -was secretly  thrilled that she was actually going to sit down with the Queen  herself! What would they talk about? The affairs of the kingdom? Over  tea and moon cakes? Gossip about the latest happenings? Truth be  told, Setsuna didn't have a clue, so she simply followed her escort  out of the ballroom down a long hallway and into a lavishly appointed  room where the blond Princess, flanked by two of her elite guard, sat  on what possibly looked to be the most comfortable plush chair she  had ever seen. Serenity nodded to the escort and he bowed out, taking  his leave of the the pair. Princess Meiou walked up and concentrated  on accomplishing the graceful bow of her entire life.</i></p><p><i>A mischievous smile crept along Queen  Serenity's face. "I won't stand on formalities back here if you  won't, Set-chan."</i></p><p><i>Setsuna blinked several times before recovering  from the bow and some of her composure. "Y-Yes, your Majesty!"  The Queen her admonished with a disappointed look. "I mean  Serenity... chan?"</i></p><p>"<i>Better." The look disappeared, replaced by  a content smile. A white cat hopped up onto the chair and stretched  itself across the Queen's lap, looking upon the Princess with it's  deep blue eyes. "You're undoubtedly curious as to why you, fifth in  line to the throne of Pluto, have been called into a personal  audience with me..."</i></p><p>"<i>The thought had crossed my mind, your Hi-"  The look crossed the Queen's face once more and Setsuna quickly  corrected herself. "I mean, Serenity-chan."</i></p><p><i>Queen Serenity nodded. "Very good. To answer  your as yet unspoken question, the Silver Millennium and I have need  of you."</i></p><p>"<i>Y-You do?" The Princess couldn't fit any  more incredulity into her words if she tried.</i></p><p>"<i>Indeed." Serenity confirmed the fact that  she had not misspoken. "What we are about to discuss shall not  leave this room, such is the gravity of the subject matter."  Setsuna nodded in agreement, her initial fluster forgotten. "As  many know, relations between Earth and the Moon kingdom are...  Delicate at the moment. Perhapse too delicate. As such, a number of  contingencies have been drawn up... Just in case." The phrase 'just  in case' hung there like a foreboding omen as each women clearly  understood the meaning behind it.</i></p><p>"<i>As you know, it is normally up to the ruler  of each world to protect the kingdom. The mantle of the Senshi  carries with it not only a responsibility to ones people, but to the  defense of the realm as well." Setsuna sat in silence, but wondered  why the Queen was elaborating on what amounted to a well known lesson  in Silver Millennium history. "Our contingency requires another  Senshi to come forth. You."</i></p><p>"<i>ME?" Setsuna blurted, totally forgetting  who she was in the presence of. "But Pluto already has a Queen!  Auntie won't be happy to hear that I stole the crown from her!"</i></p><p><i>Queen Serenity chuckled. "Of course not,  child. I would never dream of putting you in such an awkward  position... The position I intend to put you in is by far more  ambitious."</i></p><p>"<i>And what... Position is that?"</i></p><p>"<i>The Guardian of Time itself." She state in  a near reverent tone. </i></p><p><i>Setsuna Meiou twitched. "The Guardian of...  But... Why ME? Surely Auntie..."</i></p><p>"<i>First, we need Queen Aiko right where she  is... On the throne of Pluto and at my side should conditions become  less than favorable." Serenity explained to the awestruck princess.  "Second, we've reviewed your complete psychological profile, and it  indicates not only a high degree of stability, but an inherent logic  that is absolutely necessary for the task."</i></p><p>"<i>And third?"</i></p><p>"<i>And third, you're expendable." Setsuna's  mouth hung open, causing the Queen to chuckle further. "The cold,  hard reality is that if events fall to where you are actually in a  position to take the throne, then the situation has gone beyond dire.  At the moment you're far more useful in your capacity as the future  Guardian of Time than your hereditary position to the throne of  Pluto."</i></p><p><i>Setsuna was still reeling as her life turned  upside down. "Do I have a choice?"</i></p><p><i>The Queen's features softened and Setsuna was  sure she saw sorrow in her eyes. "Yes, Set-chan, you do. I could  not order anyone to this duty, for it will literally span ages. You  may become cut off from your family and loved ones. The choices you  make may will be hellishly difficult at times. The temptation will be  staggering. THAT is why I can only request you do it. Not for the  Queen, but for the people of the Silver Millennium."</i></p><p><i>The Princess sitting before her dissected the  situation carefully. "Have things really become that bad between  the Moon Kingdom and Earth?"</i></p><p><i>Queen Serenity frowned. "Not as of yet, but  the signs of a massive storm brew on the horizon. If it is nothing,  then you may never find yourself activated. I would prefer that be  the case."</i></p><p>"<i>But if it is..." Setsuna's voice trailed  off into a whisper.</i></p><p>"<i>Then may God watch over us all."</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>Ranma Saotome's eyes snapped open, yet  this time he managed to suppress the urge to bolt upright in his  futon. Instead, he opted to stare at the darkened ceiling as the  images played through his mind. There was definitely a cat in that  one, but it just didn't have the nightmare quality he was used to.  Whatever he had been dreaming as of late, it sure as hell didn't feel  like dreams...</p><p>More like memories.</p><p>But whose? No way they could be his. He didn't  know no cats, or a Queen or a young <i>Princess</i> Setsuna. And he  sure as hell didn't know what the Silver Millennium was prior to  these dreams. What ever had happened, he knew it was a <i>long</i>  time ago, and the age of the his staff came to mind. But if they  weren't his memories... The only question now was why in the heck was  he remembering her stuff? And for that matter, WHY was he  remembering? Ranma Saotome, closed his eyes at three AM in the  morning, desperately hoping that Setsuna Meiou wouldn't pay his  dreams yet another visit.</p><p>Somehow, he didn't think he was going to get off  quite so easily.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"So this is it?" Arisa asked as the  pair of women and an engineer walked through a Mishima Heavy  Industries hanger, their steps echoing across its expanse. It was  empty save one one aircraft, still gleaming with its  fresh-off-the-assembly line finish. the long trim fuselage bore the  lines of a predator, broken only by the stubby over-slung wings and  two variable angle fan jets.<p>"Ladies, I'd like to introduce you to Poison  Nine," The engineer stated with flourish, gesturing to the shining  vehicle. "Mishima's <i>newest</i> state-of-the-art Close Air  support Gunship."</p><p>Kyouko ran a finger across the the unpainted  primer gray chassis. "Reactive composite armor?"</p><p>"Yep." The engineer smiled as the two women  admired his team's masterpiece. "We figured that since you were  going to be dealing with anti-aircraft <i>energy</i> fire in addition  to the 1124's pounding, you wouldn't mind the extra weight." The  blond nodded and Arisa was already looking at the weapons pylons. "We  also decided to roll with the experimental AX15 b's for the missile  package. Instead of throwing out just fragments, they'll throw out  <i>plasma</i> fragments." Arisa grinned ferally as she inspected  the dummy warheads currently in place. "If those don't slow down  your damn android, nothing will short of an AX20 Death Hand."</p><p>"Death Hand?" Her ears perked up at the  mention of a new, insanely powerful weapon.</p><p>The engineer suddenly began to regret its mention.  "Um, yeah. We developed a fuel-air explosive missile for wide area  suppression. It doesn't pack quite the punch of a full gravity  deployed device, but it'll leave a mark."</p><p>"We'll take it!"</p><p>Both Kyouko and the engineer did a double take.  "<i>Excuse me?"</i></p><p>"You heard me." The brunette was positively  glowing with anticipation. "I want Poison Nine prepped and ready  with a full strike package before Friday."</p><p>"But the avionics haven't even passed phase two  cert yet!" He protested and Kyouko joined him.</p><p>"Ris-chan, the main gun isn't even installed on  the nose!"</p><p>"And I want a Death Hand." Arisa paid them no  mind, her eyes shining now. "make sure you have two suits of  Elemental power Armor in the hold as well."</p><p>"But...!"</p><p>"I want the paint job dark red!"</p><p>"YOU CAN'T DO THAT!" The engineer finally  exploded. "It's a prototype! It hasn't even passed air worthiness  certifications!"</p><p>"Mister... Nanako. Is it?" Arisa addressed the  engineer for the first time, her eyes narrowing dangerously on him.  He nodded. "You do know that the Boss has given the capture of the  NK-1124 an 'A' priority, correct?"</p><p>The engineer began to shuffle nervously. "Eh,  yes?"</p><p>"And as such, gives me full authority to  requisition whatever materials I deem necessary to complete the  mission, <i>right?</i>" She took a threatening step toward the poor  man. A large sweat drop rolled off the side of Kyouko's head.</p><p>"Eh.. eheh..he.. Right?"</p><p>"Which <i>means</i> you will have my Poison Nine  Close Air Support Gunship equipped with a nose cannon, full spread of  AX15 b's, an AX20, two Elemental power armors and a shiny red paint  job by Friday, RIGHT?" She menaced and the engineer shivered.</p><p>"Uh, Sure! Right!"</p><p>Arisa nodded. "Thought so. Come on, Kyo-chan.  We've got two cat-androids to find in the meantime."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Open gate, Deisu Mall!" Usagi's  miniature comm device crackled, causing her to find a deserted ally  and power up into the form known as Sailor Moon. Five minutes later  found the mall a virtual war zone with youma still flooding through  the open porthole. It was an all out free-for-all and everybody was  invited.<p>Moon jumped in beside Sailor Mercury, cutting her  closest attacker down with a Moon Spiral Heart attack "This doesn't  look good!"</p><p>"Not on your life!" Mercury replied as she  commenced to freezing two more youma advancing on the   Moon obliged her by shattering their frozen forms. "It's looking  like a full scale assault... Big youma, small youma... We're looking  at close to a hundred."</p><p>A fireball erupted in the youma ranks as Rei cut  lose and joined them. "Dammit, this has <i>got</i> to stop! They're  ruining my social life!"</p><p>"We have to keep them contained in the mall!"  Ami stated as the tide of monsters tired to advance along the Scout  line, getting torn apart in the process. "Neptune, how about that  link?"</p><p>"<i>Deep submerge!</i>" Another mob was washed  away under a bolt of water. "Chucked the link in before they had a  chance to dog pile me. Uranus and I had a hellva time extracting  ourselves." As if to underscore the point Haruka cut loose with the  space sword.</p><p>"They're <i>still</i> coming through." Hotaru  observed with a slight edge of fear as she withdrew the Silence Glave  from her latest victim. Pluto nodded.</p><p>"I'm going to have to get in close to collapse  the gate." Pluto stated coolly, analyzing the monumental task and  hordes of youma in front of her. It wasn't looking to be a fun task  as another platoon of youma pressed the assault. She knew that  regardless of how good they were, the attrition alone would  eventually kill them.</p><p>Two roses arced in and ripped the advancing youma  apart. All the Sailors turned to find a familiar atop a convenience  store roof. "It would appear as if the beautiful defenders of love  and justice could use some assistance."</p><p>"Tuxedo Mas-!" Usagi's glee was cut short as  a new figure hopped into view, balancing lightly on a telephone pole.  Black glasses, black tie, black jacket. "Prince R!"</p><p>"Oh God, it's the pervert!" Setsuna growled  and the Inners looked at her with sympathy, shaking their heads.</p><p>Tuxedo Mask stared at this newcomer, first  wondering who exactly he was, then wondering how the other Sailors  already knew him. "Prince <i>R</i>?" He asked with no small  amount of skepticism.</p><p>He ignored the top-hatted Senshi. "Verily, my  Princess. What manner protector to ones as radiant and beautiful as  thy selves throwith mere roses from a distance?" Tux's eyes buldged  as the insult took shape. "Indeed, should not a <i>real</i> man  stand with such ethereal beauty in their times of need?"</p><p>"Now listen here-"</p><p>"Foul creatures! I strike!" Tuxedo Mask's  words no sooner left his mouth than Prince R's form blurred into the  mass of youma, cutting several down with his glowing wooden blade.  "Nay, you shall not not touch such pristine beauty!"</p><p>Body parts began flying while Sailor Pluto stared  in awe. Horrified awe. What the hell was going on here? There was no  WAY this could be the same Prince R if only because this one was  actually... Skilled! Tuxedo Mask continued to throw roses into the  horde, but they only served as a reminder to just how pathetic his  efforts were compared to Prince R's rising body count.</p><p>Then it hit Usagi, "Maybe Prince R can get you  close enough to the gates to-"</p><p>"WHAT!" Pluto fumed and Usagi took a step  back. "No WAY am I going into THAT," she motioned wildly at the  mob, "with the PERVERT!" Moon looked at the Guardian of Time as  if she had gone insane. Prince R? A <i>pervert?</i> Impossible!  Before the pair could blink, Prince R and his glowing sword had  separated from the melee and appeared by their sides.</p><p>"Fear not young maidens, for I shall clear a  path through such monstrosities!" He produced a roguish grin and  jumped back into the fray, both Senshi watching as he seemingly  danced around his numerous foes.</p><p>"If the pervert keeps showing off like that he's  gonna get—WHOA!" The sentence fell off Pluto's lips as a massive  energy spike rippled through her brain.</p><p>"<i>JUSTICE WHIRLWIND!"</i></p><p>The team of Senshi watched in amazement as vapor  suddenly condensed around the man in black, twisting around his  person until the air pressure finally reached critical mass,  resulting in a supercharged high energy tornado that chewed the front  lines of the youma apart and proceeded to rip a path into the already  battered mall and heir ranks. Prince R walked out of the devestation  with a smirk on his face. "I believe that is the opening you are  looking for, my fairness?" Setsuna twitched barely suppressing the  urge to strike him down right then and there. But there were other  matters to consider, and she was off following the tornado to the  gate like a shot. He now turned to Sailor Uranus. "Not a very  personable lady, is she?" Uranus simply stared. "But, you on the  other hand... Your beauty eclipses the sun by several magnitudes."  Between the awing display of power she had just witnessed and Prince  R's roguish charm, Haruka was powerless to stop him from taking her  hand and planting a gentle kiss on it. The blushing that followed was  quite fierce. Michiru stared incredulously while the inners gaped.  She was actually letting a MAN do that! Likewise Michiru was far from  happy herself. The gaping quickly turned into smoldering resentment.  She wasn't even supposed to LIKE guys and there she was taking the  first hottie they'd stumbled across since Tuxedo!</p><p>Speaking of which...</p><p>"Hold!" Tuxedo Mask hopped down from his  rooftop sniping position. "I, Tuxedo Mask shall not let a complete  stranger paw the guardians of love and justice!"</p><p>Prince R paused in his attentions over Sailor  Uranus to size his counterpart up. "This coming from the boy who  throws roses at his opponents? Surely thou doth jest."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Usagi stared back and forth between the well  dressed duo as they stepped up to one another in challenging. On one  hand was her long time boyfriend and future husband. On the other was  the mysterious, handsome and chivalrous Prince R. "Indeed, what man  will stand aside while such perfection fights before him? Only  cowards stay in the back while weaklings throw roses... Therefore..."  The punch cut in sharply with an angle that would take it straight  into Prince R's cheek... If it were ever given the opportunity to  reach. The Prince's hand materialized in front of the fist and  stopped without play. Prince R's grip tightened to painful levels.  "And only a dishonorable fool will attack without formal  challenge." He growled and the eyes beneath Tux's Mask widened as  they stared into these dark, unflinching sunglasses. There was no  doubt as to what was going to come next. Everybody knew it. Tuxedo  Mask had lost his temper and thrown down, only to meet this man of  unflinching resolve and power.</p><p>Tuxedo was about to get his ass beat.</p><p>Actually, what happened next was quite a shock to  everybody. Sailor Pluto materialized by the remaining girls. "Ok,  it looks like the gate is sealed and the tornado took care..." That  was when she heard a sound that would haunt her to her dying days...</p><p>"<i>What a haul!"</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p>Pluto stood before the Gates cursing in  four different languages, three from the past and one yet to be  invented. Her uniform had seen better days and she was down to her  very last set of bra and panties - one's she had hoped to save for a  special occasion. But that was not to be. Her eyes narrow as she  manipulated the Gates.</p><p>Ranma had gone too far this time. He had sicced a  daemonic, panty-thieving little troll on her; one that evaded her  every effort at defense. She had barely escaped with her last set of  under-things to the Gates of Time and she was fully intent on paying  Ranma back - with very painful interest. Searching the time stream  for her prey, she soon was most annoyed that he was nowhere near  friends or acquaintances.</p><p>"Where is that bastard," she muttered  with great venom. "When I find him, I'm going to-"</p><p>"Sweeto!"</p><p>Pluto spun on her heel in time for Happi to latch  onto her chest like a baby that hadn't eaten in three days.</p><p>"So round, so soft and firm," the  troll-like man said while nuzzling between her breasts. He then  looked up with puppy-dog eyes, glistening with happiness. "You've  made me the happiest man in the world!" He declared.</p><p>Pluto proceeded to beat the troll off her. She  didn't even wonder how the little pervert got to the Gates, she just  focused on one thought, and one thought only: "Ranma, you are so  dead."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's Notes;</b> <i>Hope you don't  mind it getting a tad serious, but I've had it planned since the  beginning.
