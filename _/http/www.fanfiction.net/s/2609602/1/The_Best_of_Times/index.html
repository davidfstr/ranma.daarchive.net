</div><p><b>The Best of Times…</b><br/>By Ozzallos<br/>A Fukufics (dotcom) Production</p><p><b>Part ONE </b></p><p><b>O</b>h, she is <i>SO</i> going to get it, Ranma thought  as another fiancée locked onto his arm. This fiancée had long brown hair, soft  eyes and a combat spatula slung across her back. Somehow she managed to not  only to favor the pigtailed martial artist with a smile, but shoot corrosive  daggers at the woman on his <i>other</i> arm. The recipient, a purple haired  Amazon sniffed with contempt, opting to apply yet more of her body to the  relentless glomping of her prize. Ranma's brain stuttered momentarily as soft  body parts were applied to his person in equal measure, but was quickly  rebooted by roiling annoyance. Somehow he managed to filter the sensations that  would turn an ordinary man into nothing more than a quivering hormone and  concentrated instead on an entirely different concept…</p><p>Payback.</p><p>He wasn't sure quite yet, but two fiancées had simply  appeared out of the blue almost simultaneously and he had since become very  wary of such happenstance. There was a reason for that. Now granted, it could  be coincidence, Ranma thought if only to entertain himself and bask in the  unreality of the idea. And if it was, Akane wouldn't be showing up to—</p><p>Sure enough, the girl with a cobalt crop of short, silky  hair rounded the corner, her eyes locking on the entwined trio immediately. A  bright blue battle aura snapped into existence. "What the HELL do you think  you're doing?"</p><p>Ranma cringed slightly, but the tactical portion of his mind  was already focusing on other matters… That woman was so, <i>SO</i> going to  get it. Part of him was actually offended slightly. The least she could have  done was something different this time around. If you're going to sabotage  somebody's life, at least be creative about it; But instead it the same old  catalyst: Fiancées, glomp, Akane, Ryoga—</p><p>"NOW WHERE AM I?"</p><p>The pig tailed boy nodded. Right on schedule. He would  almost be bored with the situation if it weren't so damn annoying. Next would  be Mousse, Ranma ticked down the mental checklist as Ryoga launched into his  tirade. Mousse should be on scene within five minutes to follow up on Shampoo.  Kuno would invariably follow, but not always, followed by the Big One. He paid  little attention to Akane's rant now, noting only the pitch of her ever-increasing  pyre of rage. Ranma was more concerned with the Big One, which normally  consisted of one overly large and obscenely powerful adversary that would drop  in during the entire mess to vent his/her/its frustrations out on the world's  best martial artist. Sunlight flashed off a mirrored surface as Mousse touched down from the rooftop, blades gleaming wickedly.  Ryoga had finished his outburst. Akane had deployed her mallet and now it was  Mousse's turn. The fiancées at his arm abruptly disengaged and dropped into  combat stances opposite one another.</p><p>Ranma sighed wearily. Payback was definitely in order. With <i>liberal</i>  amounts of interest following shortly thereafter.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The long, green-haired woman smoothed out her white-black  fuku and nodded with satisfaction, locking the Time Gates before her. Keeping  the world's premier martial artist occupied was indeed a full time job, but it  was an absolutely necessary one. Sailor Pluto let the key to eternity rest  lightly on a shoulder and allowed a self-satisfied smile creep across her face.  She thought the giant purple dinosaur showing up toward the end was a nice  touch on her part. Granted, the Guardian of Time knew she should have been  enjoying her job so much, but when faced with the crushing weight of eternity's  passage, one couldn't help but to have some fun every now and then.<p>Besides, it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>Sailor Pluto had once considered letting Ranma Saotome to  lead a normal life, but quickly found that allowing him any sort of free reign  was like taking a sledge hammer to all of her carefully laid plans. Without  some sort of diversion, the outcomes that led to Crystal Tokyo dissolved into a  hectic mass of divergent probabilities, each as likely as the next while only  six point five percent favored the future she was so desperate to achieve.  Normally the Outer would have just removed him at birth, but the chaos that  flowed around him and his family made it all but impossible to track <i>that</i>  event and his subsequent childhood. She could almost feel the gates wince  whenever she tried as they outright refused to lock onto the boy. It had taken  Sailor Pluto sixteen years to devise a counter and once Ranma settled in  Nerima, that was all she wrote. While she couldn't track him or his chaos-ridden  family, she <i>could</i> track his friends and acquaintances, of which he  seemed to have plenty.</p><p>The bad news was that once she had finally located him those  sixteen years later, his power had grown exponentially. Outright removing him  from the timeline had proven all but impossible. After all, you can only direct  so many meglomanical kidnappers, Chinese gods and Phoenix people at somebody  before giving up in absolute disgust as they failed time and again to bring the  target down. But Sailor Pluto was the Guardian of the Time Gates for a reason  and she had learned early in her career that which could not be destroyed could  invariably be manipulated. In short, she kept one of the world's most powerful  martial artists busy. <i>Very</i> busy. He had certainly given her enough  material to play with and he was now very easy to track in that quagmire named  Nerima. Pluto still couldn't focus on him specifically, but his friends,  enemies and acquaintances generally knew enough for her to manipulate and  conduct operations against the boy. As long as she could keep it up, Crystal  Tokyo stood a ninety-six point three chance of existing.</p><p>Sailor Pluto nodded to herself once more. All in a day's  work.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Most people would have killed for a wishing sword. All Ranma  had to do was look cute as a girl. He remembered the day quite clearly as  family, friends and enemies had taken a pointed interest in exactly what he  would be wishing for.<p><i>"Ranma wish Shampoo and Airen marry, yes?"<br/>"I say you wish for a few million in cash, Saotome."<br/>"You are definitely going to wish for a cure, boy!"<br/>"No way is that Amazon Hussy marrying my Ran-chan!"<br/>"If you don't wish for cure for all of us, I'll kill you  Ranma!"<br/>"Quack!"<br/>"Oh my!"<br/>"What do I care what that baka wishes for anyway?"  </i></p><p>Even the memory was painful, Ranma winced as he blurred  through another kata, creating a nearly imperceptible flaw in its flowing  precision. The arguing over his wish continued for another ten minutes before  his patience exhausted itself and he uttered those fateful words—</p><p><i>"Ahhrg! I wish I knew why I can't get a moment's peace!"  </i></p><p>He hadn't meant to say that. In fact, he had meant for his  actual wish to have more substance, but the frustration of the moment consumed  him and the sword activated. That's when the focus of Ranma's entire life  changed. The image of a green haired woman imprinted itself into his mind's  eye. She was 5'6", had long green hair and unusual purple eyes. The vision wore  a modest lavender business suit and was, by all rights, drop dead gorgeous. The  visage faded and was replaced by one of the same woman wielding a heart tipped  staff. Now she wore a very revealing black and white fuku, showing off generous  portions of the woman's marvelous curves. All in all, Ranma would have been  more than happy with the vision, if not for the knowledge that crashed into him  like a sledgehammer seconds later. She was Setsuna Meiou otherwise known as  Sailor Pluto, Guardian of Time. Even if the wish hadn't supplied him with the  information, her title said it all and it became clear that she considered him  a threat. This, of course was why his life was hell—She was directly  manipulating the events around him to <i>make</i> it hell.</p><p>Ranma finished the last of his kata and began to slow  through the cool-down phase. <i>Why</i> she was so intent on screwing up his  life wasn't known, as the scope of his wish hadn't provided that particular  morsel of information. What it <i>had</i> provided was awareness, and ever  since that vision Ranma's awareness of the events around him had snapped from  idle acceptance to piercing scrutiny. Soon, the pigtailed martial artist began  to see the patterns of her meddling. They were normally quite easy to spot once  he knew what to look for since they invariably had her trademark 'signature' to  them. Five months down the road, Ranma Saotome was able to spot a "Pluto was  here" event miles away, Even if he could do nothing to avoid it. Now they  served only to reinforce those feelings of payback.</p><p>The pigtailed boy had now moved from the Dojo to his room,  pulling out the aging copy of <i>Pop Tokyo Now!</i> from under his futon and  flipped it open to the folded page. Ranma Saotome, heir to the Anything Goes  School of Martial Arts generally wasn't one to pick up the latest trendy teen  girls magazines, but this one was special. What caught his eye was the group  photo of the Sailor Scouts on the front and it had taken every ounce of his  Soul of Ice technique to overcome the embarrassment of buying the frilly girls  magazine. Ranma plopped down on his futon and now viewed the marked page containing  the bios of each Sailor Scout. It was probably the hundredth time or he had  done so, but he was now operating solidly under the premise of 'Know Thy  Enemy'. The wish had given him fairly detailed information on Setsuna herself,  but none on her partners in crime. Knowing that she was a Sailor Scout made it  easy to pick up information on her friends, as every teen magazine seemed to  have an over-abundance of them. Even without the knowledge of their real  identities, there was more than enough information on them to discern their  powers and likely tactics. Ranma pulled out another issue, this one title <i>Teen-Teen  Express!</i> It was ironic that Ranma could now buy girly teen magazines in  either form without so much as flinching now and days. Call it a perverse form  of curse therapy. He thumbed through the new magazine now, not the least bit  self-conscious of the fact that it was pink, cute and decidedly aimed toward  the female population. This particular copy had in-depth personality  information and the like, which he absorbed like a sponge. If Setsuna Meiou  even had a clue as to what she had done to trigger this behavior, she might  well be shaking in her high-heels.</p><p>Simply put, neither realized that what the Outer had done  was a very bad thing for her long-term sanity. The fact that she was meddling  in his affairs wasn't enough to cause the change, but his actual knowledge of  her <i>was</i>. Ranma's psyche had been somewhat of a mixed bag since  childhood. Had he been allowed to develop normally, the martial artist could  have easily been a genius in anything and everything he applied himself to.  Instead, he had been denied any semblance of a normal life, traumatized, beaten  and forced to concentrate with unwavering focus on the martial arts. The result  was a form of mental scarring that all but locked his fantastic mental process  in a box, only to be released when faced with a fight. Normally this wouldn't  be a problem for the Senshi of Time but for one minor detail… Now that Ranma  knew an outside force was influencing his life, that tactical computer was  finally freed from its bottle and it analyzed <i>everything</i>, actively  searching out her influence in order to avoid or prevent it. It also began to  affect his normal life, and very slowly that genius level intellect began to  assert itself in every area of his life. It wasn't a perfect match as there was  still a lot of scarring to overcome, but it was there. Free. And slowly winding  up like a ravenous jet intake.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was perhaps a redundant item of interest to point out  that Nabiki Tendo had absolutely no concept of personal privacy. Or rather she <i>did</i> have such a  concept, but simply chose to apply it only to herself. Everybody else however,  was fair game. Like many other commodities in life, privacy could be bought and  sold for the right price and Nabiki was an expert in the art of invading that  particular aspect of people's lives. Certain people were of course exempt from  this practice, Kasumi being tops on that list. The eldest sister was sweet,  kind, caring… And held more leverage in the household than she could shake a  broomstick at. Kasumi never got angry. She got even. In <i>very</i> subtle  ways.<p>Ranma Saotome, resident freeloader and future brother in-law  to be, however was at the very bottom of that list.</p><p>Tonight it was time to invade his privacy, collect some  debts and extort some pictures from him. Or rather, her. It was a shakedown in  every sense of the word and like every other night, she was certain it would go  off it out a hitch. Of course, that supposition flew right out the window the  moment she turned the door handle to his room and stepped in. All things  considered, she had seen stranger things since the Saotomes took up residence  in her home. Ass-ugly Phoenix Birds. Demonic possession. Any number of  shape-gender-species shifting martial artists. Yes, while the sight in front of  her was easily eclipsed by those events, it still ranked somewhere in the top  twenty of Nerima's Weirdest. It was Ranma. Laying on his futon. <i>Surrounded  by teen girls magazines</i>.</p><p>Needless to say, Nabiki Tendo took a moment to recover.</p><p>Ranma's head snapped up and the two considered one another  for a small eternity. The Mercenary recovered first. "You know Ranma, if you're  going all girl again, at least give me some warning first."</p><p>The words snapped Ranma back to the real world with a  crimson blush and he flew off the futon, away from the offending "literature";  if one could use such a term and maintain a strait face. The martial artists  flailed wildly in embarrassment. "It's not what it looks like!"</p><p>"It looks like you were reading a bunch of teen magazines."</p><p>'Uh… Right…" Ranma found a much neglected spot on the wooden  floor at his feet, avoiding eye contact in its entirety. "It's… um, ah,  Research."</p><p>Nabiki's eyebrow arched. This situation had money written  all over it. "Research? I see. Researching the latest in beauty tips?"</p><p>"No!" His head snapped back up in protest, a pained look on  Ranma's face.</p><p>"Fashion accessories?"</p><p>"NO!" The protest came more loudly and Nabiki simply  smirked. This was 'Money' with a capital 'M'.</p><p>"I see." Nabiki stated, smiling widely now. "One hundred and  one ways to satisfy your man?"</p><p>"NONONONO!" The horrified look on Ranma's face was  priceless. "Dammit, I'm researching the Senshi!"</p><p>"As in the <i>Sailor</i> Senshi?" Nabiki asked with a slight hint of  incredulity. Ok, she decide, the situation just went from run-of-the-mill  strange to downright weird. A girly Ranma she could accept. There was  precedence to that. A male Ranma defending his manliness while surrounded by  teen 'zines and researching the Sailor Senshi was just north of the Twilight  Zone, however. Ranma opened his mouth and closed it just as fast, realizing his  most grievous error. Not that there were too many ways for him to talk his way  out of the situation Nabiki observed with predatory glee. The evidence just  doesn't get more damning than this. She considered the situation thoughtfully.  "Ok, Saotome. Before I extort a very <i>large</i> sum of money from you, would  you care to explain why you have at least fifteen girl magazines and why you're  reading up on the Senshi?"</p><p>Ranma looked indignant at first, then sighed. "Sure, why  not. As if yer gonna believe me anyway." Nabiki simply waited in the doorway. "Remember  that stupid wish I made?" Oh, Nabiki remembered it all right. A veritable  fortune flushed away because of Ranma's bumbling. A minor scowl crossed her  face at the thought and she tacked on a bit extra to Saotome's 'protection'  bill.</p><p>"I got my wish after all."</p><p>Nabiki blinked, annoyance temporarily forgotten. She had  thought- like everybody else –that the wish was so assinine that it wasn't even  granted or that the sword just told him he was an idiot and disappeared. But  the fact that it had granted the wish and Ranma about it was an  entirely different matter. What was that wish again? Ah yes… "You wished you  knew why you can't get a moment's peace?' What's that got to do with…?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Well, I found out why I can't... Get any  peace, that is." Nabiki was actually interest now and watched as he picked up  one of the many magazines. "This is why."</p><p>Nabiki focused in on who he pointed at in the glossy  picture. "<i>Sailor Pluto?</i>" He watched the skeptisim form in her eyes. "You  do realize…"</p><p>"How unbelievable that sounds?" Ranma finished and she  nodded. "Yeah, but before the wish, I didn't even know what a Senshi <i>was</i>  and her face and everything about her was crammed into my head."</p><p>"So all of this…?" Nabiki waved a hand towards the strewn  magazines. She shivered at his next words and the ice that laced them.</p><p>"Know thy enemy."</p><p>Every doubt that Nabiki had as to wheter Ranma was pulling  her leg or not evaporated in that instant and she knew that he was going after  The Defenders of Love and Justice. Not that she cared as such. Love and Justice  weren't exactly the harbingers of profit by themselves, but stir in one  pigtailed martial artist…</p><p>"Alright Saotome… Let's talk  business."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Finding the Sailor Senshi was a trivial task. Every piece of  "literature" Ranma had pointed to the district of Juuban as their primary base  of operations. The plan was easy enough; wander around town, find a Youma attack  and wait for the Senshi to show up.<p>He watched the fight from atop a nearby house, cloaked using  the sealed Umi-sen-ken technique.  Despite his general knowledge of the magical girls, it was exactly  that—"General". If this he was going to have any chance in hell of formulating  an effective plan against Pluto's meddling in his life, he was going to need to  get to know them a bit better. The fight progressed and Ranma began to mentally  tag the three combatants present. His eyes first fell on the sailor with a  short crop for cobalt blue hair. He had seen her in the magazines before, but  that never stayed the feeling of intense deja'vu he felt whenever looking at  Sailor Murcury's image. The girl could have easily passed as a younger Akane  Tendo in some other life. She hung at the back of the battle and appeared to be  consulting some sort of tiny calculator as the other two engaged their target,  a sickly pink looking creature that vaguely resembled a woman. With claws.  Really, really long claws.</p><p><i>"Crescent Beam!"</i></p><p>Golden crescent arcs of light slammed into the monster,  sending it skittering across the landscape courtesy of the blonde in the orange  and white fuku. Some serious power, Ranma noted as Sailor Venus carried the  assault forward. The battered "youma" as Ranma had come to know them righted  itself just in time for the next attack to slam home courtesy of the green and  white clad girl, otherwise known as Sailor Jupiter. The lighting bolt burned  through the monster's torso, which was already weakened by Venus' last attack.  The Youma sagged and stared at the smoldering hole in it's chest before  collapsing completely, disintegrating into ash.</p><p>Good, Ranma nodded from the rooftop as the trio gathered  around the remains. It would put a serious crimp in his plans if he had to help  them at this point. The battle had been quite enlightening. The Sailors  appeared to rely heavily on ranged attacks that definitely weren't ki-based.  Magic based? Ranma rolled the idea around in his head. That would fit with the  information he have so far. So far it wasn't anything his martial arts  abilities couldn't emulate to one degree or another. Ah, there they go. It was  almost laughable that they were actually fighting in those costumes, though it  appeared they took surprisingly little damage in the tussle. Magical as well  most likely, which meant they the girls were probably tougher than they looked.</p><p>Ranma roof hopped after the girls and it wasn't five minutes  later that he found them outside an apartment. PLEASE tell me they aren't that  obvious, he thought at the girls, who merely looked around to make sure nobody  was watching and promptly de-transformed. The martial artist shook his head in  disgust. How in the world have they survive this long! The Defenders of Love  and Justice transforming to their daily selves right in front of their home  base? On one hand he was happy they had such an exploitable weakness while  on the other hand it was downright scary that they had such an exploitable  weakness. He stared down from the rooftop as they filed in and felt something  was off… Something vague. Like his brain didn't want to associate the Sailors  with the girls he just saw de-transform.</p><p>Wonder if this is what Kuno feels like, Ranma thought with  some amusement as he tried to analyze the sensation. It had a taste to it. More  magic? It would certainly explain how they could get away with being so  careless, he decided and began to case the apartment. Hmmm… If <i>I</i>  were  a sailor- Ranma cringed at the thought –I'd have all sorts of security  on that  place. Windows. Doors. Everything. But then, they haven't exactly shown  much  skill in the art of subterfuge either. He mentally noted the sun  drifting  lazily toward the horizon and decided he'd had enough fun for one day.  Three  Sailors and their civilian faces were commited to memory, a base of  operations tagged with no sign of reprisal while Pluto's residence was  already burned into his brain thanks to the wish. All in all it had  been a pretty  good day, which got Ranma to wondering… Just how much did The Meddler  know  about him and his activities? He'd have thought that if keeping him  tied up was  a priority, Sailor Pluto would have put an even higher priory on  curbing today's  reconnaissance, let alone positively ID'ing her teammates. Ranma chewed  on the  revelation as he roof-hopped home. Whatever she was, it was looking as  if she didn't have a complete picture of his daily life… which in turn  led to  yet more questions, such as how she got her information and how much  she could  find out. Even so, his tactical mindset awakened with today's  revelations that  his opponent was far from all knowing and all seeing.</p><p>That fact alone gave him  considerable leeway to formulate his payback.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Setsuna Meiou was concerned. Not panicky, just concerned.  Apparently Ranma was taking a day off, because she could not find him for the  life of her. Not that the Gates would have locked onto the boy anyway, but he  apparently wasn't around any of his friends either. When combined with the  chaos that surrounded him, he was effectively invisible unless she could pin  down somebody who had seen him and THAT would take a lot of work if she had to  expand outside friends and family.<p>Sailor Pluto shrugged. Aw, what  the hell. Let him have his day off. She smiled. After all, tomorrow  was pterodactyl day.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma stared. It was an honest-to-God giant pterodactyl. He was almost flattered. Sailor Pluto, the Senshi of Time had sicced <i>Rodan</i>  on him. The enormous winged reptile blew overhead once more in yet  another attempt to impale him with its razor sharp talons. It had  actually been Mousse who had unleashed the monster against him, but  Ranma knew Setsuna's handiwork when he saw it and knew she had somehow  arranged for Mousse to come into possession of the ancient summoning  statue. Yes, she was the one responsible, even if by proxy. The  pigtailed martial artist sent another Moko Takabishi into the over  flying beast's belly and it seemed to staggered in midair before  escaping to high altitude.<p>By now even Mousse  realized his mistake and had joined in the defense of Nerima as the air  came  alive in a surreal display of martial arts anti-aircraft fire. Swords,  maces, training potties, ki-blasts, spatula shiruken, ninja stars and  other exotic  ordinance tracked through the sky in an effort to bring down the  wayward  Jurassic reject who had steadily been ripping apart Nerima in its  effort to  evisorate Ranma. That was two hours ago, and what had Ranma Saotome to  show for  his troubles?</p><p><i>WHAAP!  </i></p><p>"WHATDDYA DO THAT FOR?" Ranma  hollered as he peeled himself from the floor. He would almost swear that mallet  was made of ki absorbant materials since he never could seem to detect its  presence or its inevitable application to his person.</p><p>"That's for almost destroying  the city!" Akane fumed indignantly.</p><p>"IT WASN'T MY FAULT!" He  protested and watched as she gripped the stealthy mallet tighter.</p><p>"It's your fault for flirting  with that hussy all the time!" Akane countered and Ranma missed a vital  connection somewhere.</p><p><i>"WHAT?"  </i></p><p>Akane's eyes narrowed sharply  and the rest of the family watched the scene play out with morbid fascination.  It really was better than a soap opera. "If you didn't flirt with the Chinese  Slut so much, Mousse wouldn't be jealous. If Mousse wasn't jealous then he  wouldn't have resorted to using a giant flying reptile against you!" Ranma  twitched at the thoroughly twisted logic, and then she added out of spite,  "Pervert!"</p><p>Ranma blinked as the family  stared on in silence. Akane glowered at him. If there was ever a moment of  absolute clarity in Ranma's life, it was right here and right now. Two thoughts  burned in Ranma's mind. First, Akane was absolutely insane. He loved her. Even  killed for her, but it was moments like these that made him doubt if the world  was even round, let alone his relationship with her. The second thought?</p><p>Setsuna Meiou was <b>SO</b> going  to pay.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Setsuna Meiou teleported into  her room later that night. Ranma hadn't been the only one having a long,  excruciating day. Sure, that exercise in insanity had brightened her spirits  considerably, but then she found the probabilities on Crystal Tokyo drifting  again and had to remove three minor villains and a teenage pop idol from the  timeline. The villains were a gimmie as they would eventually grow in influence  to challenge the Senshi. Not that they would ever beat her girls, but they  would appear and join forces at a most inopportune moment, knocking Crystal  Tokyo out of the probabilities by five point eight percent. The Pop Idol on the  other hand was a different matter entirely. She was entirely too distracting  for her own good and simply had to be eliminated.<p>Setsuna de-transformed into an  elegant business two piece and flipped on the light. She immediately froze.  There were hundreds of them. No, <i>thousands </i>of them. <i>Everywhere</i>.  One crawled atop her high-heeled shoe. The woman formerly known as Sailor Pluto  twitched.</p><p><i>"AAAIIIIIIEEEEEeeeEEEEEEEE!"  </i></p><p>Fifteen minutes later a  concerned Usagi stared at the huddling ball quivering on the sofa, Michiru  sitting next to her in a futile attempt to comfort the terrified woman. Nobody  would have believed it if they hadn't seen it themselves since the oldest of  the Senshi wasn't generally prone to abject, irrational terror. Or any other  emotion, for that matter. But then, who wouldn't be after being subjected to an  apartment room full of roaches, all of which had absolutely no concept of the  words 'personal space'.</p><p>"I think that's all of them."  Ami stated as she swept her clam shelled PDA around the premises once more. Ah  yes, the Murcury Computer… being used to hunt roaches. The cobalt blue haired  girl frowned at the thought.</p><p>"Any idea what caused this?"  Michiru asked from the couch, stroking the stricken woman's green hair gently.</p><p>"No. The house is clean. No  evidence of forced entry." Ami fingered a sheet of paper, handing it to Usagi  first. "Except for this."</p><p>The blonde took the yellow  sticky note and read it allowed, eliciting the first reaction from Setsuna  Meiou since they found her screaming. Her head snapped up and eyes widened to  the size of dinner plates.</p><p>"Ranma was here."</p><p><i><b>End Part 1</b></i></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's notes:</b> <i>Fukufics asked if I could do a  Ranma/SM fic for them and I said, "Sure, why not?" with little idea of what I  was getting myself into. Needless to say, we're talking about a nearly  saturated genre of fics. The biggest challenge was creating something original  and after two aborted attempts, I think I have something here. things to look  forward to: Sailor Nova Ranma (w/Fuku, Sunny ;). Sailor Tux Ranma. More Fiancees (for both Ranma  and Pluto). The infiltration of the Senshi. The manipulation of said Senshi. A  tub full of Cheeze Wiz. And of course, The Big Battle™.</i><p><i>Think of it as just one huge pissing contest.<br/>And that's just the first date ;)</i></p><p><b>Akane;</b> <i>I'll head this one off before it gets started;  Yes, I do portray her as a beotch. No, I did not fall into the lazy "Akane's a  hose beast" trap. I purposely stepped into it, thank you very much If you  ever see me with a pro-Akane fic, there's a snowball fight going on in hell.</i></p><p><b>Pluto's Eye Color;</b> <i>Damned if I could find one pic  that have the same shade.
