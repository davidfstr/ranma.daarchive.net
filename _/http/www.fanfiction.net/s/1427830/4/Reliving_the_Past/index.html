</div>Wolfgang Krauser stood tall as the transparent walls of the platform rose to the heavens. He could feel his body protesting the strain of his battle against Rugal, but that was of little consequence to a man born and raised to fight.<p>Lightning illuminated the skies as a gust of wind preceded the first water drops of what would be a storm. Their contact upon his skin was a pleasurable experience, as their low temperature seemed to revitalize the tired warrior.<p>The crowds didn't seem to mind the rain as they continued to watch the upcoming fight. So far they had seen two battles of epic proportions. They wanted more.<p>Iori stared at Krauser with cold eyes as the rain poured down on them, somehow unable to quench the fiery passion that burned for a challenge. The red-haired man spoke no more. It was time to fight now.<p>They barely heard the announcer call a start to the fight. But they did more afterwards.<p>Krauser rushed forward, but what he didn't expect was for the smaller man to rush him as well. The next thing he knew Iori was in close quarters, too close for his long arms and legs to be really effective against a smaller opponent.<p>Iori wasted no time in taking the fight to the tired man. He rushed into a range that would make his opponent's attacks awkward, but his own would land solidly.<p>Krauser felt a burning sensation across his chest and tried to jump away and get some breathing space. His move was followed by Iori, who didn't let him get away and lashed out with another wicked claw strike that rendered his skin painfully. Under normal circumstances Krauser would be fast enough to get out of this compromising situation, but he was nowhere near top form and his speed was the attribute that suffered the most.<p>Iori continued to chase Krauser around, never letting the older man a single second of peace. He knew quite well that Krauser, even as tired as he was, would be a very dangerous opponent if he managed to recover from this disadvantage. It would only be a matter of time before the German man collapsed from the blood loss.<p>Krauser's vision was starting to darken as he fought off Iori. But his struggles were meaningless. Every attack he threw at the redhead was dodged or blocked. His punches would miss their mark, and any attempt to grapple was countered with speed. *Truly a magnificent strategy.* He thought as he kicked low, attempting to win some time by sweeping Iori's legs from under him. His effort was again wasted as Iori swerved to the side like a snake and lashed out with those damnable fingers of his. The Heir of Strolheim had to wonder what kind of training Iori went through to have such strong hands.<p>Iori was amazed at the amount of damage inflicted on Krauser. Not because he believed it was too much, but because he could still feel his opponent was strong enough to continue for another minute. Any other would already be unconscious or dead. He refrained from using any of his special techniques. They were powerful and would likely finish Krauser off, but they would require time and that could be risky.<p>The crowd watched the fight with some disappointment, since they expected a fight like the last one, but some had to admit even Krauser couldn't keep fighting at such a level forever. At least there was a lot of blood, which started to paint the platform red from all the moving around the bleeding Krauser did to try and get some room.<p>As it was the fight only lasted for about a minute more. The exhausted German warrior collapsed to his right knee, chance that Iori took advantage of to finish things. He rushed forward and slammed Krauser down with one hand holding his face. "SHINE!" An explosion of purple fire followed Iori's bellow as Krauser's body was covered in a searing pain that led to darkness.<p>Mr. Big gulped audibly when he saw the result of the fight. From what he could see Iori would beat him into a bloody pulp. Not that he wouldn't give it his all, but it seemed like the Rugal Team would be the one facing the Fatal Fury Team in the final match.<p>-<p>Terry couldn't help but be disappointed when he saw the end of the match. Mr. Big did put up a good fight, even managed to tag Iori a couple of times with some good blows, but he was no match for the red-haired man from the beginning. He wasn't disappointed because of that, though.<p>Iori would be in top form for the final match, considering the enhanced healing due to his blood, but Ranko was out of the fighting. Rugal, even with his blood, would still be far from his peak in fighting power. That meant his team would be facing against Iori and Rugal, who was a formidable opponent even if weakened but was weakened nonetheless.<p>Terry couldn't feel the familiar exhilaration of facing against a seemingly unbeatable opponent this time. Both his opponents tomorrow were formidable in their own right, but were only two people to face against three very experienced fighters.<p>Without a word to the others he left the room and walked down the hall to return to Mary. Anyone could see the Lone Wolf lacked something as he advanced in the dark halls of the Coliseum. Very few were the ones who could tell what was missing.<p>-<p>Leona looked up from Ranko's unconscious form when the door opened. Her eyes softened when she recognized Iori. He stood victorious in front of her, the bruises on his skin testament to the battle. She locked gazes with him and nodded, a small smile gracing her features.<p>Iori lost himself in the sight. Leona had always captivated him, but the few times she let a smile illuminate her features he could almost swear he was looking directly at the Sun.<p>Shaking his head slightly the red-haired man turned his attention, with great difficulty, to the young woman in the bed. Ranko slept peacefully unaware of their victory. "Thank you, Leona."<p>The blue-haired woman shook her head. "I owed it to her." She said turning to look at the small redhead. "You won."<p>Iori nodded. "We won."<p>"Tomorrow you fight against the Bogards." Leona said seriously as she turned back to Iori. "Will you win?"<p>The red-haired man smirked. "I'll try. It won't be easy without Ranko, but I'll try." In fact he was rather excited by the concept of fighting against the Fatal Fury Team. Fighting Terry alone would be interesting enough, but adding Joe Higashi and Andy Bogard to the mix would be quite a challenge.<p>-<p>"I knew I could trust you to take care of things. Did you have any problems?" Geese asked, even though speaking was very painful with his current injuries. He was currently in bed and speaking to someone next to him.<p>They were alone in the room, with Ranko asleep on another bed. The redhead still didn't regain consciousness, but no one expected her to do it for at least another twelve hours.<p>Outside stood Ripper and Hopper, who had just arrived.<p>A female voice answered Geese's question. "Nothing we couldn't deal with. Did you have a hard time fighting Ranko, husband?" Mature asked in amusement.<p>Geese snorted. "The girl got a lucky shot in. I'll teach her a lesson next time we spar. She almost killed herself." With that said he smirked and gently patted Mature's belly, she was on her sixth month of pregnancy. "How's the kid doing?"<p>Mature took Geese's hand on her own. She liked the man, he was a great lover and didn't put up much of a fight to marry her when she told him she was pregnant. In fact he seemed rather excited at the idea of having a baby with Orochi blood.<p>She started working for him shortly after the tournament in 1997, when she was presumed dead. She was supposed to become another bodyguard, like Ripper and Hopper. In less than a month they were already having sex regularly though, usually during office hours.<p>"He's been a good boy today." The blonde woman said.<p>"You keep insisting it'll be a boy." Geese said with a smirk, which looked rather grotesque in his bruised face.<p>"I know it's a boy." She said in a tone of voice that allowed for no discussion. Normally he would argue and they'd end up having a screaming match that led to a small fight and more sex, but right now he was in no condition to do that.<p>Geese sobered as he turned to Ranko again, this time his eyes focused on the raise and fall of her chest. "She nearly didn't make it."<p>Mature's expression softened. "Her spirit is too strong to accept defeat. Even if her body isn't quite as strong, which is the problem." She smiled teasingly. "Are you worried about her, Geese Howard? Could it be that the heartless crime lord isn't so heartless after all?" She liked teasing her husband, especially since it helped to divert her attention from her own concern for the redhead.<p>"Where are the others?"<p>*Changing the subject, are you?* The woman thought in amusement. "They're in the bar. The only ones still out are you and Ranko. And don't think I'll allow you to join them with your injuries." She finished sternly.<p>Geese snorted. "It takes a lot of guts to order me around, wife." Guts was something he definitely respected. When they could be backed up, of course.<p>-<p>"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!" The announcer greeted the audience as he smirked under his sunglasses. The crowd was wild and they reacted very well to his words, roaring in expectation of the final match of the tournament. "Today we'll witness the final match of the King of Fighters Tournament."<p>More cheers were heard all around the Coliseum, which was about to burst. "May I present to you..." He paused a little for effect and continued in an excited shout. "THE FATAL FURY TEAM!"<p>The crowd all but exploded as Joe Higashi, Andy Bogard and Terry Bogard stepped out onto the arena and headed for the platform.<p>The eldest of the Bogard brothers took a deep breath and looked up to a blue sky. "It's a nice day." He commented just loud enough for Joe and Andy to hear him.<p>Joe looked up to the sky and agreed with his friend. They did have good weather for the fight.<p>Andy didn't even acknowledge his brother's words. He was too intent on the fight to care what the weather was like. He wouldn't be facing against Geese, but Rugal and Yagami were also two people he disliked.<p>Joe got bored as the announcer took his time to present the other team and, after raising his fists in the air for the crowd, turned to Terry. "So how's Mary doing?"<p>Terry smiled. "She's fine. Should be completely recovered in a couple of weeks." He'd spent last night in Mary's room, sleeping on the floor even if Mary tried to convince him to share the bed. He didn't want to risk it with her injuries, so he promised he would make it up to her. Maybe it wasn't the smartest thing to do now that he thought about it, but it was already done. *Wonder what she'll come up with.*<p>Joe patted his friend on the back.<p>Finally, after five minutes, the announcer spoke again. "For today's match, the final fight of the King of Fighters Tournament..." More cheers. "...I present to you THE RUGAL TEAM!"<p>The crowd showed just how much they hated the members of said team as Rugal Bernstein and Iori Yagami stepped out. No one was surprised by Ranko's absence, since she was lucky to be alive. Insults were screamed to the top of their lungs, death threats weren't rare either.<p>Iori and Rugal remained impassive through it all as they walked to their side of the platform. The taller man was still sporting some bruises from yesterday's fight, but he moved as if they didn't bother him. It could easily be seen that both were concentrated completely in the fight ahead.<p>Eventually, after the announcer prolonged the start of the fight for as long as possible, Joe and Rugal stared at each other as the walls started rising around them. They stared hard at their opponent, looking for a possible weakness to exploit.<p>Joe narrowed his eyes as he assumed his fighting stance. He knew the opponent in front of him was very strong, but because of yesterday's fighting he should also be tired. *Must be careful. He's got some really dangerous moves.*<p>On the sidelines Andy watched impassively with his arms crossed over his chest. "Joe should finish this quickly." He said seriously, seeing as Rugal wasn't completely recovered from the day before.<p>Terry didn't comment on his brother's words. He knew Joe had a very good chance of making it to Iori and, since he was the third member of the team, it was very likely he would be fighting an already weakened Yagami.<p>Rugal regarded his opponent as the announcer prepared to call the start of the fight. He sneered at the shorter man and started concentrating energy. "It won't be that easy." He growled out as he fell to one knee and supported his weight with his right arm.<p>Terry's eyes widened when he felt the accumulation of power. He'd felt it before.<p>Iori stared in amusement as Joe looked confused at his opponent falling to his knee in apparent agony. He turned all around and could see the remaining fighters, save for a few that knew what was going on, sharing Joe's expression.<p>Joe took a step back when he saw Rugal's skin darken a little.<p>-<p>Billy stared at the platform in interest as steam was expulsed from Rugal's body. He'd seen this once before, but it was still quite an impressive sight.<p>Right now he was in the room assigned to Geese and his team. Geese himself was still in bed, since Mature didn't let him get up and run the risk of aggravating his injuries. Krauser sat calmly watching the fight and, if it weren't for the bandages covering his body, one would think the German noble was in perfect health.<p>"So he can control it now?" A female voice asked from the side.<p>Billy didn't even turn as he answered. "Yes." It still amazed him just how well Rugal could adapt to different situations.<p>-<p>"I don't like this." Chizuru muttered.<p>Mai, who sat by her friend's side, turned to Chizuru with a puzzled expression. "What don't you like?" It was pretty clear to her that her husband's team would win the fight without much trouble, especially since it seemed Rugal wouldn't be able to fight at all.<p>Chizuru turned to regard the ninja sideways. "Rugal is accessing the power of the Orochi." She said gravely.<p>-<p>It finally dawned on Joe and the others what happened when Rugal stood up to his full height. "Oh no." Joe whispered when he found himself staring up into Omega Rugal's maniacal eyes.<p>"READY GO!" The announcer cried out.<p>The announcer hadn't even closed his mouth when Rugal was already on his opponent. Joe barely managed to lift his arms in time to block the flurry of blows he was recipient of.<p>Rugal appeared behind Joe, seemingly having teleported, as the effect of his attacks took its toll on the smaller fighter. Joe grit his teeth at the pain coming from his forearms. He turned instantly and attacked, not waiting for Rugal to recover and launch another attack.<p>Rugal had barely turned when he received a flying kick to the gut. He grunted as Joe followed it up with two quick punches and charged his chi to finish the combo. "TIGER KICK!" Joe let loose with a knee blow to the bigger man's jaw, lifting him off the ground as he himself soared to the heavens. The wisps of chi surrounding his attack were just dissipating as he looked down, finding Rugal roll with the fall and dash for the still falling Joe.<p>Rugal managed to right himself in his forced flight and landed on his feet. As soon as he did he ran towards his opponent with the knowledge he was vulnerable right now. The blow to his jaw made his vision darken a little, but nothing he couldn't deal with.<p>Joe's feet touched the ground just as Rugal reached him. Out of desperation, since he knew Rugal could finish the fight with a single one of his special techniques, Joe lashed out with a sloppy kick.<p>Rugal didn't even acknowledge the feeble attempt at defense as he reached forward with his right hand.<p>Joe's vision was blocked by Rugal's hand as his head was caught in a vice grip by the bigger fighter. The last thing he would later remember was Rugal's insane laughter.<p>"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" Rugal pulled Joe into range and started delivering devastating attack after devastating attack all over his opponent's body. After what seemed like an eternity to the spectators Rugal finished the beating with his Genocide Cutter. He landed lightly on his feet at the same time Joe's crumbled form crashed down on the floor.<p>Even the announcer was silent as Rugal chuckled to himself for his easy victory.<p>-<p>"JOE!" Andy yelled as he rushed to his friend's side after the platform walls were lowered.<p>Terry joined his brother and instantly went over Joe's injuries. The downed fighter sported some severe bruising and had more than a few bones broken. He was in no danger of dying, but it would be a while before he was back in fighting form.<p>After making sure Joe would be fine he stepped back so that the paramedics could take his friend away. Terry turned to regard Rugal and felt the familiar sensation of the challenge burn in him. He'd thought today's fight would be done with fast and easily. He didn't think Rugal and Iori, as strong as they were, could stand up to three experienced fighters. *But it seems I was wrong.* The thought, instead of making him angry over what happened to Joe, made him tense in anticipation.<p>Andy turned to glare at Rugal, who was smirking evilly at the Bogard brothers. "I'll get you back for this." He promised the taller man.<p>Rugal chuckled in amusement. "You're next."<p>"That I am." Andy said coldly, not at all impressed by the power Rugal seemed to be emanating in waves.<p>-<p>"Quite an impressive display." Krauser commented as the platform walls started to rise around Rugal and Andy.<p>Billy snorted. "He's very strong, but there's a weakness even he can't overcome. That's why he didn't turn into that monster when he fought you."<p>"Is that so?" The German noble asked with a raised eyebrow.<p>"You'll find out soon enough. Rugal won't be able to deal with the Bogards as easily as he did with Higashi." The woman said as she languidly sat on her chair, stretching her long legs. She smirked when she noticed Billy giving her a nervous look and turn sharply to the about to start fight. *He's cute when he's flustered.* She thought amused.<p>-<p>Mai bit her lip worriedly as the fight started. As strong as Andy was she couldn't ignore the ease with which Rugal dealt with Joe.<p>Chizuru noticed the worry evident on her friend's face and tried to appease her. "Don't worry. I don't think this is like the last time." Now that she had more time to feel the power she could tell it wasn't like last time. Granted, Rugal was emanating a lot of power, but not as much as the last time he turned into Omega Rugal. *Could it be that he learned to control it?* The thought was disturbing to say the least, but at least it didn't seem like Rugal would kill his opponents if Joe was any indication.<p>Mai didn't seem to hear her friend as she saw Andy roll away from another dash. She really hoped she could be by his side to face this foe.<p>-<p>"You're fast." Rugal growled out. At the moment he had been unable to deliver any truly significant damage. Andy was too fast.<p>Mai's husband didn't reply as he studied his options. So far he'd been mostly dodging Rugal's attacks, concentrated entirely on not being where the taller man wanted him to be. It was working to make Rugal angry, but he was achieving little more than that. The big man's attacks weren't weakening, and he was cold-headed enough not to make any mistakes.<p>Andy jumped back and rebounded off the wall as Rugal sent another enormous chi blast his way. "HISHOU KEN!" He cried as he threw a chi blast of his own at the approaching Rugal, who blocked it with his forearms without any visible effort. But that was all Andy needed to rush in. "ZAN'EI KEN!" He bellowed as he seemed to appear inside Rugal's defenses, an elbow firmly planted on his opponent's sternum.<p>As tough as Rugal was in his current form he doubled over before the inertia of the attack threw him back crashing against the transparent wall. He landed on his feet and growled angrily at Andy, who was already jumping in with a kick to press his advantage.<p>Rugal blocked with his forearm and, before Andy's feet touched the ground, kicked the youngest Bogard back into the air just as he started concentrating to deliver some damage of his own.<p>Andy flipped in midair to land on his feet, but before he did so his breath was taken from his lungs as Rugal dragged him towards the opposite wall of the platform. He was slammed against the wall and further damaged as Rugal used his chi to cause an explosion of energy that engulfed Terry's brother.<p>Rugal jumped back and assumed his fighting stance.<p>Andy got to his feet and assumed his own stance, but it was obvious that the attack took its toll on him.<p>They stared at each other for a long time, either recovering their strength or studying each other no one knew. The crowd remained silent, taking the break in the fighting as a chance to take a breath.<p>Then, as if they were one, they rushed each other and started fighting all over the platform. As Rugal did most of the chasing Andy retaliated as best as he could, using his speed to compensate for Rugal's advantage in power.<p>-<p>Iori's eyes followed the fight closely as he pondered over the fact that Rugal was using the power of the Orochi blood, and it didn't seem like he would be consumed by it this time around. *Wonder how long he'll be able to last.* He thought, knowing full well time was Rugal's enemy more than Andy Bogard was.<p>-<p>Krauser smirked as he heard what Billy said. "You mean he can't keep fighting at that level for very long?"<p>"Indeed." The woman answered. "Since he wasn't born with the Orochi blood each minute he stays in that form puts a toll on his body. He didn't dare fight you like that because he knows just how durable you are."<p>Krauser returned his attention to the fight. "So Andy Bogard, even if unknowingly, is using the only strategy available that will lead him to victory." He concluded. "This tournament sure hasn't been boring."<p>-<p>"Look out!" Terry yelled as Andy made his first mistake of the battle. It could very well cost him the fight, as it did Joe.<p>-<p>"SHORYUU DAN!" Andy bellowed as he jumped and twisted on himself, making his arms hit Rugal's body multiple times as the both of them raised to the air. Andy stopped spinning as he prepared to land, only to find a grinning Rugal waiting for him. He then realized that, in his own haste to finish the fight, he put himself in a situation very similar to Joe's before he was defeated.<p>Rugal punched the youngest Bogard hard on the jaw, which was followed by another punch that doubled his opponent over. A right snap kick straightened Andy again, and his eyes were already glazing over as Rugal used his left leg to jump and deliver the last attack. "GENOCIDE CUTTER!"<p>Rugal once again fell to the ground, but instead of looking arrogantly at his defeated opponent he stumbled and barely managed to remain on his feet. "I can't believe it. I didn't even make it to the last match." He said to himself as he powered down. He could feel his body protesting from the strain of keeping such a high level of power for so long. He didn't expect for Andy to be so much trouble.<p>Everyone was understandably confused when Rugal, instead of boasting about his victory over Andy, vomited blood and passed out.<p>-<p>"Idiot." Iori muttered as Rugal was taken away. "Even after all this time he still doesn't understand he can't control this power."<p>But he did manage to defeat two opponents, leaving Iori and Terry left to fight it out. As both fighters entered the fighting area they stared at each other silently.<p>-<p>Ranko opened her eyes slowly, wondering just where the hell she was and why she heard a constant banging in her head. She tried to get up and almost cried out when her entire body flared out in pain. *What the hell happened? I haven't felt like this since I fought Yamazaki the first time.* She thought trying to focus her sight enough to look around.<p>*I must have a concussion.* She thought as she found focusing her sight harder than she thought. All she managed to make out was a blur around her, with some movement to her left.<p>Taking a deep breath she closed her eyes and concentrated on her chi flows. She noticed her chi level was incredibly low, but managed to accelerate the healing a little bit.<p>She felt a little of the dizziness reside as her chi flowed more freely through her, but found it strange that the banging continued. *And even harder than before.* She thought in confusion.<p>It was then that she decided to open her eyes again. *Not perfect, but good enough.* Now she could tell she was looking at the ceiling of one of the infirmary rooms. *Now why am I here? The last thing I remember is...* She was taken out of her thoughts as she heard a sudden scream and turned her head to the side.<p>She realized with dread that the banging she heard wasn't a result of her current state.<p>Closing her eyes shut and turning away the small redhead's face turned as crimson as her hair. *Can't those two ever GIVE IT A REST?*<p>END PART 4<p>Author's notes: Well, wanted to post this one since on Wednesday I'm going out of town for a couple of weeks. If I don't answer any e-mails please be patient, I'm not sure if I'll have access to a computer while I'm away.<p>In the next chapter you can expect the tournament to come to a close, care to take a guess on which team becomes the champion?
