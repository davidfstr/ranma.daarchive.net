</div>The wind picked that particular moment to blow dramatically, making the clothes of both men flutter as they silently stared at each other. One wearing jeans with a sleeveless jacket and a cap, the other leather pants and a short leather jacket with a crescent moon on the back.<p>He stared at his opponent as he swayed back and forth in a deceptive battle stance, those who didn't know it would dismiss it as useless. But his opponent knew better. These two fighters had encountered each other before, and they respected each other as warriors at least. "Bogard." He said coldly to his opponent.<p>"Yagami." Terry Bogard said back, acknowledging he would fight against an opponent that had gotten the better of him. Not many people could claim that. "You killed Kyo."<p>Iori snorted. "You all knew I would eventually succeed in my quest. That blasted Kusanagi didn't take me seriously, so he paid the price."<p>Terry had to grudgingly accept that fact. Even if Kyo was one of the finest fighters he knew the boy spent too much time on activities that didn't involve training. Iori had publicly declared his intentions to kill Kyo and trained for it. Kyo's death was still Iori's fault, but part of the blame could also be placed on the young man's arrogance. "And now what?"<p>Iori shrugged as he started circling his opponent, looking for possible weaknesses. "Now we fight."<p>Terry adjusted his cap and started circling Iori as well. He was familiar with the Yagami style, so he knew to be extremely careful.<p>Both fighters heard the signal for the start of the fight, but they continued to silently study each other. The time for words was over, now it was time to fight.<p>Terry decided to start the fight slow, going in for a punch to test Iori's defenses. He was far from surprised when Iori's arm blocked flawlessly and the redhead retaliated with a powerful kick, which Terry avoided by stepping back and out of close range.<p>Iori then took a swipe at his opponent, which was dodged, and jumped over a sweep to land easily on his feet and charge for an exchange of blows.<p>The fight started slow, but the tempo steadily increased until both fighters were exchanging blows savagely, and many of those attacks managed to snake through the defenses put by them. The sound of flesh meeting flesh filled the silent coliseum as blow after blow was delivered. After a couple of minutes the fighters jumped back to get some breathing room. The audience exploded in cheering now that the fighters were staring at each other.<p>Terry smirked as he surveyed the damage. He could tell he'd managed to land the most blows on Iori, but even then the fight was more than evenly matched. Iori had a lot more stamina than he did. What also made him smirk was that he'd gotten a good hang of Iori's fighting style, which helped to avoid any blows that could've seriously hurt him.<p>Iori stared dispassionately at his opponent. He knew the fight was just beginning, but right then and there he could tell why Terry Bogard had been the King of Fighters before. The man displayed an incredible adaptability and his moves were both powerful and precise. He narrowed his eyes and decided to take the fight up a notch.<p>As if they shared their thoughts both fighters started charging to fight for real. The warm-up was over; it was time to fight for real.<p>"POWER WAVE!"<p>"DOSHITA!"<p>While Terry hit the ground with his fist, sending a wave of chi bursting towards his opponent through the floor, Iori swiped forward and used his heritage, sending a powerful purple flame at the blonde fighter. Both projectiles cancelled each other, but no sooner had they done that when the fighters were already on each other.<p>"SHINE!" Iori bellowed as he smashed Terry against the hard floor, cracking it on impact.<p>"RISING TACKLE! Terry retaliated in getting up as Iori tried to finish him where he laid.<p>Iori rolled with the fall and charged at his opponent, who as soon as he landed charged as well. They both launched a powerful punch towards the other.<p>Iori received the blow on the jaw and his vision dimmed for a moment. He didn't let that bother him as he finished with his move.<p>Terry smiled when his punch landed, but instantly realized the problem with the exchange when he felt a tearing sensation go up his midsection all the way to his upper chest. Iori's fingers ripped his chest open, and only because his body was completely charged with chi he wasn't defeated by one that attack.<p>"POWER CHARGE!" Terry yelled as he twisted, in the process taking the force away from one of Iori's devastating kicks, and rammed his shoulder into Iori.<p>Iori was sent flying back and his body hit the transparent wall before he fell on his feet, the wind knocked out of his lungs. He crossed his arms in front of his chest when he saw Terry charging for something big. He didn't have time to dodge out of the way.<p>Terry slammed his fist on the floor again, but this time the effect was different. "POWER GEYSER!" A literal geyser of chi energy erupted from beneath Iori's feet.<p>Iori refused to scream in pain as the energy tore through his body. Instead of that he withstood the assault with his remaining energy. *Bogard is a lot stronger than last time. At this rate he'll defeat me with little trouble!* Iori thought, frantically trying to find a way to even the scales.<p>Terry recovered from his technique to see Iori still standing. "BURN KNUCKLE!" He cried out as he launched himself forward, his entire body surrounded by a corona of chi as he lead with his fist.<p>Iori's eyes widened when he saw the attack coming and he retaliated as best he could. He launched a kick to Terry's midsection, but even then the kick had no effect. Terry's punch, on the other hand, was devastating. Iori found himself slammed against the wall again, only that this time the wall cracked with the force. Iori remained standing for a couple of seconds more, only to find his knees give out under him. *I won't lose like this!* He thought in rage as consciousness slowly left him.<p>-<p>"Damn!" Billy cursed as he jumped to his feet. He couldn't believe the power Terry was displaying.<p>Krauser could only stare with wide eyes at Terry Bogard. *Even with the training I've submitted myself to I would be defeated by that man.* He thought in amazement. The thought, instead of scaring him, made him even more excited. There was a fighter out there with the power to defeat him. He would be the one to fight his way up to Terry's level this time.<p>"It seems like the fight is over." The woman said trying to hide the shock of actually seeing Iori defeated with such ease. Even if the fight was a long one Terry had the upper hand all the time.<p>Billy nodded when Krauser suddenly perked up. "This fight isn't over." The German noble said gravely.<p>Billy and the short-haired woman turned to him with curious expressions on their faces.<p>Krauser leaned back on his seat and stared at the kneeling form of Iori Yagami. "I believe this fight has only just begun."<p>-<p>*Iori.* Leona thought worriedly as she felt in her blood what the redhead was trying to do. *Please be careful.*<p>-<p>"You're the best, Terry!"<p>"Great fight!"<p>"I love you!"<p>Those and many more cries came from both the fighters and the audience as Terry recovered from that last move. He stared at his fist and then at the slumped form of Iori Yagami, a fighter one year ago he lost a fight against. But for some reason he felt empty after the fight. He realized this must be how Krauser felt all those years with no competition.<p>He was taken out of his thoughts by a sudden surge of power coming from his downed opponent, who was trying to regain his feet. It was erratic at best, but an obvious attempt at recovering. "Better stay down, Yagami." He said seriously, not wanting to continue with such a one-sided battle. Without special attacks Iori was the one with the advantage, but once they fought full out Terry was obviously the superior fighter.<p>Iori coughed again, but this time the cough came with blood that stained the platform. He started breathing heavily through his mouth as he seemed to be gaining strength.<p>Terry's eyes widened when he connected the surge of power with what Iori was doing. *No way!* He thought in alarm as he remembered Leona doing the same thing when he fought her.<p>The blonde's hesitation was all the time Iori needed to stand up and bellow to the heavens. A cry filled with rage and power resonated through the entire coliseum, instantly silencing everyone as they turned to see the fight was far from over.<p>Iori Yagami, in the Riot of Blood, was staring at Terry Bogard through pupil-less eyes.<p>-<p>He didn't even see the hit coming, as fast as Iori moved. *But I definitely felt it.* Terry thought as he jumped to his feet and away from an axe kick that cracked the floor. He retaliated with a couple of punches and a kick, all of the shrugged by the now berserk Iori, before jumping back and away from a swipe that would've disemboweled him. *He's incredible!*<p>Iori launched another kick. This time Terry was forced to block and he barely had enough strength to stop the blow's momentum. His arms felt numb after the hit and all he could do was channel even more chi through them to be able to stand up against the beast craving for his blood.<p>Iori growled as Terry landed a punch to his jaw, but once again he ignored it and charged forward. He managed to take advantage of Terry's recovery time to land a claw strike.<p>Terry cried out in pain as his shoulder burned. "RISING TACKLE!" His shoulder sent even more waves of agony through him as he executed the move, but as he landed Iori landed hard on his back and that gave him time to study the damage. *This is not good.* He thought as he got a good look at his shoulder. It was a miracle he could still use it, and when this fight was over it would take months for him to fully recover.<p>He barely managed to evade another attack from the recovered Iori. *I have to finish this now!*<p>Iori turned to his opponent with a snarl. He charged, this time concentrating to deliver the final blow.<p>Terry could feel the energy buildup and knew this was it. He had to give it his all if he wanted to survive. Forget about winning the fight. As Iori advanced, leaving afterimages in his wake, Terry cocked his fist back and concentrated for a big blast.<p>"POWER GEYSER!"<p>Iori felt the energy burn his body, sending agony to his very soul, but he plowed through the attack by sheer will power.<p>Terry let loose with the strongest chi blast he'd ever used. He was understandably surprised when he saw Iori emerge from the energy onslaught and take a hold of his shoulders with a wicked smile.<p>What followed was Iori slashing and tearing into Terry with a savagery that put to shame all his previous performances. The blonde fighter cried out in agony as his skin and muscle were rendered under the powerful blows. He was slammed against the ground and Iori reared back to deliver a hammer blow to his chest, which cracked his ribs. He delivered a second one, making Terry cough out blood. When he prepared for the third and final one he was sent flying back.<p>"BURN KNUCKLE!" Terry called up the last of his reserves and delivered a punch from his awkward position on the ground. He really hoped that was enough, because he was barely able to move after Iori worked him over.<p>Iori crashed against one of the walls of the platform and landed sprawled on the floor.<p>Both fighters started to struggle to their feet, the both of them having trouble to focus after the arduous fight.<p>Terry was the first to make it to his feet. He stood shakily and looked as Iori managed to stand tall. The smile on Iori's face chilled him to the bone.<p>Iori stared through a red haze at Terry Bogard and started chuckling. *This fight is over.* He thought as he started to laugh harder and harder.<p>Terry resigned himself to losing. *But I'll go down fighting.* Ht thought as he assumed his fighting stance. He could feel his body was about to give out on him, but he had enough energy to pull one or two more of his most powerful moves.<p>He wasn't prepared to what happened, though. Iori continued laughing and suddenly fell back, completely unconscious.<p>The lone wolf let his hands drop to his sides and sighed in relief.<p>-<p>"I'll be damned! He still won!" Billy cried out in disbelief, believing for sure Iori would rip Bogard into bloody shreds.<p>Krauser silently stared at the victorious Terry. *I'll train even harder to face against you again, Terry. We shall see who is the strongest then.*<p>-<p>The announcer smiled as the transparent walls of the platform lowered. He stepped onto the platform and approached the happy blonde fighter. Ladies and gentleman! This tournament has come to an end!" Cheers all over the coliseum were heard. "May I present to you the champion team of the tournament... THE..."<p>"HOLD IT!" A female voice cried out, stopping the announcer cold. He and everybody else in the coliseum turned to see who it was that stopped the celebration. They gasped when they saw who it was.<p>"The fight isn't over yet!" Ranko Howard yelled from the hall to the infirmary. She was standing tall and proud in the shadows, seemingly ready to fight.<p>-<p>"BLOODY HELL!" Billy cried out in disbelief. "THAT IDIOT WILL KILL HIMSELF!" He yelled knowing just how severe where Ranko's injuries and for a moment forgetting Ranma's curse was a secret.<p>Thankfully for him everybody else was too shocked to see Ranko already up and ready to fight.<p>-<p>"I can't believe it." Mary whispered, unable to fathom how Ranko was able to stand after only one day of being beaten to within an inch of her life. She was currently in a wheelchair and her injuries where nowhere near as bad as Terry said Ranko's were.<p>-<p>Leona's eyes widened when she saw Ranko already standing. *She'll kill herself!* She thought in alarm, knowing full well the extent of the redhead's injuries.<p>-<p>Terry and everybody else stood transfixed as Ranko started walking forward and out of the shadows of the hall.<p>The illusion was broken when they got a chance to study the redhead's form under the rays of the sun. Instead of walking purposely and proudly as before, Ranko was limping since her leg was in a cast. Her entire back was soaked with blood, bandages covered most of her body and her skin was pale white.<p>Terry stared at the approaching figure with no small amount of respect.<p>Ranko suddenly stumbled, unable to keep walking, and fell to her hands and knees crying out in pain as her ribs protested the treatment.<p>"Ranko!" Another female voice called out in urgency and everyone was treated to the sight of a pregnant blonde woman rushing to Ranko's side.<p>Eyes widened when they recognized the pregnant woman as someone that was supposedly dead.<p>-<p>"Ranko! You should go back to bed. You'll only aggravate your injuries." Mature said as she tried to hold Ranko's body from collapsing, uncaring that she was staining her clothes with blood.<p>Ranko's head kept spinning as she tried to figure out what Mature just told her. "Gonna fight." She mumbled as she tried to get to her feet. It had taken most of her strength getting to the center of the coliseum, but she wouldn't give up now that she was here.<p>Mature sighed and helped the small redhead to her feet. She then slung one of Ranko's arms over her shoulders and helped, more like dragged, the young woman to the platform.<p>-<p>Terry watched the whole thing with an expressionless face. *She can hardly stay awake.* He thought as Mature let go of Ranko, who stumbled a little but did manage to stay on her feet.<p>The announcer was so shocked he wordlessly left the platform for the walls to rise. "I can't believe this." He muttered to himself at Ranko's courage and stupidity.<p>Ranko was thankful for the wall behind her back, for she could lean on it and don't have to worry about the floor moving as she raised her hands weakly. "Come on." She muttered at the three Terrys staring at her. "Fight."<p>-<p>Everyone stared at the display in varying states of awe.<p>But they all agreed on one thing. Terry would hardly have to touch Ranko to win, possibly even kill her. That is if she didn't die where she stood. Blood was now flowing from the corner of her mouth, and she was even paler than before, if that was possible.<p>-<p>Terry stared at Ranko for a long time. *She's a warrior alright. With one of the strongest spirits I've seen.* He thought sympathetically, since he could relate to how she wanted to fight regardless of her injuries. *I can't do it.* He thought as he turned around and started walking to his corner.<p>"Hey! Where do... do you think you're going?" Ranko demanded as she tried to walk after Terry, but only managed to stumble and fall flat on her face. She gripped her burning chest in pain as she stared at Terry's retreating form with hatred. "Fight me, Bogard! Fight me!" She growled out.<p>Terry ignored her and reached the wall. "I give up." He said to the announcer. "This fight is over." He just couldn't run the risk of having Ranko die. He wouldn't be able to stand the thought of being responsible for someone's death like that.<p>Terry ignored everything else around him as he walked away once the wall was gone. *We'll meet again, Ranko Howard.*<p>"DAMN YOU, BOGARD!" Ranko bellowed in rage as she lost consciousness.<p>She wanted to fight.<p>END PART 5<p>Author's notes: Short? I know. But this was a good place to cut it since the tournament is now over. Next chapter will cover the events several weeks after the tournament.
