</div>Ranma/ The Big Hit<br/>'Easy Target'<p>"One of your best, you mentioned?" Scarlet enquired, running her hands along her tight vinyl pants, as she uncrossed and re-crossed her legs.<p>"One of my most trusted, I have my own ways of dealing with anyone who is under my employ, but he requires a special touch."<p>"He's that good, hmm?" a woman with short cropped chestnut hair in a business suit that barely hid her feminine outline, came up to the chair that Scarlet was sitting in.<p>"Indeed, as much as I trusted him, I cannot have any open ends in my house. I suppose you heard what happened in San Francisco?" The three girls nodded. Melvin Smiley managed to make a mess of things, "Good, here's his file."<p>Scarlet picked up the folder that was tossed onto the desk, and opened it. Her breath caught at the photos, "Oh... my..."<p>"Scarlet?" Lavender approached her partner, "What is it?"<p>"Girls, let us thank Mr. Straumhaus for a very special Christmas he's giving us."<p>"But it's only May..." Lavender was backslapped by Chef.<p>"Ranma, Ranma Saotome," Scarlet let the name roll off her tongue lavishly, before dragging a fingernail delicately across the image.<p>"You ladies know him?" Richter asked curiously.<p>"Oh yeah, the Seven Fiancées know him well," Chef stated coldly, alluding to the origin of their group name.<p>::Bleep:: 'This is Ranma' ::Splash:: 'And Yohiko,' ::Splash:: 'We can't come to the phone right now, but,' ::Splash:: 'Leave your name and number and we'll get back to you.'<p>"[Yohiko? Yohiko, please pick up the phone!]"<p>Ranma rolled over in bed, and pushed a tuft of raven colored hair from his face, and mumbled, "Kim, I swear, if it's another 'I'll never find love' crisis..."<p>"[I guess you've gone to work early,]" the message continued, "[Please, I need to talk to you, it's really important. I... I'll tell you later,]" Ranma knew enough not to pick up the phone in his male form, so let the message record. That also gave him the option to talk to her later, since he currently wasn't awake enough to have the mental capacity to deal with his best friend right now. He decided that he would feel better doing it after collecting his fee for last night's job.<p>Ranma looked around at the marble hall with various Roman style pillars, irritated. No one was at 'the Vault' to hand him his pay. He wasn't too familiar with protocol on receiving payment from there, since he usually received it directly from Richter. He hadn't had to deal with Richter's absence since his boss only took off work every once in three hears. He really enjoyed his job.<p>"Hey! I ain't got all day!" The pony-tailed man yelled out for anyone's attention, he growled when he got no reply. He supposed that something may be wrong here, but he never had done this before.<p>"Hmm, maybe it's not open today?" Ranma mused, and then weaved to the side. A flat object whistled by him, and stuck into the Plexiglas teller window, "What the..." He turned around to see a woman in a men's slate gray power suit cut slightly for a woman, carrying a whipping cane slung on her shoulder.<p>"Hello, Saotome," Ranma turned again to the side, so see a woman stepping out from the side, wearing a black leather jacket, scarlet t-shirt, with tight vinyl pants that showed off her gorgeous legs. On her feet she wore a pair of menacing looking steel-toed boots. He couldn't see her face, as her hair was draped in front of her face, hiding it from view.<p>"Uh, can I help you ladies with something?" Ranma asked curiously, if they wanted to get his attention, all they had to do was call out.<p>"Yes, there is quite a bit you can help us with... airen."<p>Ranma's eyes got realllllllll wide. "Uh, h-hi... Shampoo," Ranma managed to squeak out.<p>"Aren't you happy to see us too?" The woman with the whipping cane asked coldly, as she took up a southern style pole stance with the weapon; holding it at an angle upwards from the waist at her side with her guiding hand forward.<p>"The name's not Shampoo, you twit," Ranma turned to see the woman that had run into him at the mall yesterday.<p>"Uh, Xian Pu?" Ranma ventured with a nervous grin. Lavender wasn't amused, as she pulled out two lavender-chrome plated Jericho 941s. Ranma could see from where he was standing that they were heavily modified, "Heh, I see you lightened your hair color a bit... heh, heh..."<p>Ranma gulped as Lavender's facial expression never changed, "And... Ukyo?"<p>Chef nodded, and started scooting forward slowly, still keeping her weapon ready<p>"And that means... that," Ranma turned to the remaining woman, and ducked a gloved fist with steel armored knuckles. The missed punch went right through the half-foot thick Plexiglas window. Scarlet growled as she jerked her arm, dragging a gash through it.<p>"Yeah, me," Scarlet growled, turning with a right roundhouse aimed for Ranma's head. The pony tailed man ducked under the blow, and rolled. Scarlet growled as she removed her lodged foot from the wall.<p>"You guys aren't still mad, are you?" Ranma asked in his roll, his answer was a steady stream of ten bullets that forced him to roll.<p>"Of course not, 'Airen'," Lavender sneered, pushing the trigger forward on her right gun, causing it to open it's handle hatch that hinged at the trigger. She brushed her trench coat from her side to reveal a series of gun clips, and scooped a clip up into her gun, and closed the hatch, "Just because you left me a homeless old maid, doesn't mean I lost any affection for you."<p>"Oh, as long as you're not bitter," Ranma commented sarcastically and he sprung to his feet, "Wait a minute, I've been set up, haven't I?"<p>The three approaching women face faulted, allowing Ranma to attempt a break for it. Chef recovered first, and lobbed three throwing daggers that cut off the pony-tailed man's escape. Ranma ducked and slid under the barrage, only to have to stop his momentum and Adidas windmill out of the way of a hail of bullets.<p>Ranma got to his feet, and was forced to directly block Scarlet's right side thrust kick. The pony-tailed man was sent flying onto his back, sliding a good few yards. Scarlet's gotten quite a bit stronger. Ranma rolled out of the way of Scarlet's leaping pounce, and grimaced at the sound of marble shattering where his head once was. Scarlet and Ranma both recovered at the same time, though the woman was the aggressor.<p>Ranma leapt over the mid level crescent kick and redirected the follow up outside crescent kick to the head. Scarlet kept spinning into a left handed back fist, which Ranma blocked with his left arm against at her wrist. Ranma shot arm over the black endowed woman, and trapped her arm under his armpit, allowing him to shove her away then with an open palm blow to her upper ribs in the back. Scarlet started to fly back, but not before catching Ranma in the jaw with a left rising ax kick, sending the pony tailed boy to the ground.<p>"She kicks high," Ranma said with a slightly giddy mirth, before he had to roll backwards from a horizontal blow of a whipping cane. Ranma rolled into a backhand spring, and kept back flipping as Chef twirled her weapon from side to side after her target. Ranma somersaulted away, pulling out his dagger guns as he was in the air.<p>Ranma reversed the grip on his left gun and blocked Chef's strike to his right temple with it. The short haired woman spun around the other way, attempting to catch Ranma in the nose with the other end, in which the pony tailed man bent backwards to avoid. The woman spun the staff on the same side and stabbed forward with the same end at her opponent's clavicle. Ranma brought his right dagger in a reverse grip across his throat got block, but was surprised as Chef at the last moment jerked the whipping cane upwards, catching Ranma in the nose.<p>The Pony tailed man launched himself backwards, lest his nose get pushed into his brain from the kill shot. Chef built up momentum for the next blow by twirling her staff from one side to the other, and then spinning backwards to her right, bringing the whipping cane down in a heavy strike. Ranma went into an Adidas windmill, managing to catch the cane with the side of his right foot, and as he overturned onto his right side, kicked out with his left foot and pushed his opponent away.<p>As Chef stumbled back, Ranma kicked himself to his feet, and then bent backwards from Lavender's trench coat that flowered out at stomach level. The Pony tailed man gulped as he saw its edge slice through a portion of one of the marble pillars. Ranma twisted out of the way of the lavender clad woman's follow-up descending ax kick, and attempted to kick her away with a back thrust kick. Lavender swung her right leg over it, and then her left to leap over Ranma's retaliatory strike; her left foot attempting to take off his head.<p>Ranma bent his head down farther, and dropped to the ground with his hands braced on the floor. He twisted on the ground, and trapped Lavender's right leg between his ankles, and twisted again for a leg takedown. Lavender fell and twisted with the momentum, allowing her to scoot up and attempt to drive her left heal through the bottom of Ranma's jaw. The pony tailed man evaded by rolling to the side and recovering to his feet.<p>As soon as he stood, he found himself on the receiving end of a right-handed gut punch that lifted him off the ground. Scarlet smirked, as she carried him on her fist three yards into the wall behind him. Ranma's back hit the wall, forcing the rest of the air out of him, but he managed to retain the right mind to duck under the woman's left hook that carved a deep furrow into the marble wall. Scarlet spit out the dust and marble debris that got in her face and distracted her to allow Ranma's right elbow to be driven into the side of her face.<p>Ranma rolled against the wall to avoid Lavender's leaping left foot kick, and then ducked as she twisted backwards to her right while still in the air and brought the heel of the same leg after Ranma's head against the wall. Lavender landed, and spun, her coat once again billowing up, forcing Ranma to jump up and braced his back against the wall, and his feet against the pillar in front of him. From his position, he decked Lavender with the handle of his dagger gun, and kicked away Chef with his left leg as she attempted to strike him from that side.<p>"RRRRAAAAAHHHH!" Ranma yelped at Scarlet's growl, as she pushed hard against the pillar he was braced against, sending it tumbling forward, broken. The pony tailed fighter rolled out of the way of the heavy debris, and reached into his pocket.<p>"STAND STILL AND FIGHT!" Scarlet screamed, kicking one of the heavy pieces out of the way and sending it flying at the scurrying man.<p>Ranma ducked behind a pillar, the large piece of airborne marble striking against it and chipping off a part, "Just like when we used to spar, huh, Akane?"<p>"DON'T CALL ME THAT!" Scarlet yelled, charging her shoulder at the pillar Ranma was against. The pony tailed man moved from behind it as it shattered, and turned to the three women with his flash in his hand. Once the girls were blinded, he made a run for it.<p>Ranma made it into the hall, and met up with four men wearing bulletproof vests with guns trained on him. Ranma leapt up and over the bullet hail, grabbed onto the ten-foot high ceiling and pulled himself flat against it. Before any of them could readjust their aim, Ranma dropped down to the floor flat on his back, his own guns firing off at the ceiling above them. The collapsing debris distracted them enough for Ranma to get in close and knock them out.<p>By the time the Seven Fiancées recovered their vision, Ranma was long gone.<p>"Dammit! How did he get by ALL the posted guards in the building?" Scarlet demanded, punching through a wall in frustration.<p>"He probably used the Umisenken," Chef stated factually, folding up her whipping cane and storing it in the holder on her side, "We know he uses it, we know how to neutralize it."<p>"Hey, Anyone seen Ranma around? He owes me..."Squeaky stopped as he looked around the vault, "God Damn, what happened here?"<p>"Oh? You're looking for Ranma?" Scarlet asked sweetly, as she strode sensuously towards the sleazy looking Tai. Chef and Lavender grinned at each other.
