</div>Ranma/ The Big Hit<br/>'Easy Target'<p>Ranma stepped into the weight room, and saw Scarlet sitting at a desk watching her expectantly while doing one arm curls with a three hundred pound weight.<p>"Ranma!" Squeaky called out, relieved to see his partner had come to save him.<p>"Hey Squeaky, how goes?"<p>Scarlet stood up, set down the weight she was using to do curls with, and smirked at Ranma before the other man could reply, "Most people would be impressed that you managed to get past Lavender, much less Chef and her both.<p>"You don't sound like it."<p>Scarlet shrugged, and walked from around the desk, used the remote control to shut off the monitors of the TV she was watching to keep herself occupied, and set it down, "I knew what you were probably capable of. Hot water?" Scarlet offered the coffee pot filled with steaming water.<p>Ranma waved the offer off, getting an eyebrow raised by the other woman, "So, you think you still know me after all this time?" the redhead enquired guardedly.<p>Scarlet motioned her head to the monitors, "Both of them are still breathing, you probably figured you owe us something, or felt too guilty about beating on them in the first place."<p>Ranma snorted in indifference, "I know my profession well enough to kill only when needed to."<p>"Right, it was option number one then," Scarlet said distastefully, "At least you have some honor left."<p>"Hey, I don't owe you guys noth'n!"<p>Scarlet turned to Squeaky, "Think she's a bit too adamant about that?"<p>"Don't answer if you know what's good for you," Ranma growled, Squeaky intelligently kept his lips shut.<p>"Ranma, Ranma, Ranma," the woman tsked in distaste, "still not wanting to take responsibility, still not wanting to hear the truth." Scarlet took up a Shotokan stance.<p>Ranma took up a loosely guarding kempo stance, "I got tired of being blamed for everything even before I left Nerima." The redhead's eyes narrowed, "Don't back around here and pretend like I would miss it."<p>Scarlet flexed her leading left fist, the sound of stretched leather being the only sound in the room. Ranma ground her braced foot harder into the floor by the ball of the foot. Each fighter looked into the other's eyes, daring one another to make the first move. Their breaths remained steady, their stances firm. Finally, Ranma's gaze flickered for a nanosecond over to Squeaky.<p>"HAAAAAAA!" Ranma twisted out of the way of her opponent's straight right cross, and then tilted back out of the way of the left crescent kick aimed for her head. The redhead then ducked forward when the other woman brought the same leg back in a hook kick, and then weaved around the right cross, left jab, right rabbit punch, left uppercut, left knee, right hook, and left hook.<p>She had gotten faster, Ranma noted, and she's not telegraphing like Fed Ex. But with a smirk, the redhead realized she hadn't seemed to learn improvision, with her moves still remaining rigid, and she was nowhere near the redhead's speed. This was going to be way too easy after Shampoo and Uk...<p>"Getting cocky, boy," Scarlet imitated from her last instructor during her barrage with a nasty grin.<p>::WHAM!::<p>"Ooooh," Squeaky winced in sympathy, as the redhead slammed into the wall behind her, leaving a spider web indenture.<p>"Still... got that... brute strength," Ranma-chan stated, shaking the haze from her mind as she braced her feet back on the ground.<p>Scarlet chuckled, with her right fist still raised, "I wouldn't take this too lightly, Ranma dear."<p>"So, Pops trained you?" It made sense, she didn't notice until now that she was being set up to fall for a telling blow, like her father used to do. Scarlet's fighting style was a heavy mix of his father's form of anything goes, which Ranma defiantly had difficulty contending with, and the wonderful brutality that was sheer Akane.<p>Scarlet nodded, "You left him pretty broken when you ran out on all of us."<p>"Feh, he dug his own grave, I got tired of taking up the slack for the panda."<p>"Are you that heartless?" Scarlet stated with slight incredulousness, as if she had been confirmed of a suspicion, but didn't truly want to believe it, "He really did love you, you know?"<p>"Sure he did, all the scars from the cat fist just remind me of his affection."<p>"When you left, Nodoka couldn't bring herself to kill him, but he was left without a family name," Scarlet smirked, "In a way, the pact between the families would have been fulfilled, if not for the fact that we were both ronin."<p>"I guess we all have to take responsibility," Ranma stated grimly, as she went back into stance.<p>Scarlet's eyes were veiled by her hair, though the redhead could imagine that they were flaring in anger, "BASTARD! IT'S *ALL* YOUR FAULT!" She charged after her opponent, and attacked with a series of kicks with her right leg.<p>Ranma was careful this time, as she weaved through the kicks, and when an opening was spotted, she retaliated with her own kicks with her right leg. Scarlet guarded and dodged against the majority of the attacks, and the ones that slipped through were disregarded as irritants.<p>The redhead pulled back to gain a breather, and Scarlet once again went on the offensive with a series of furious paced punches that almost seemed to predict where Ranma would be. The pony tailed woman leapt over a fierce right cross and turned in the air to her right. She then twisted back to her left, while lashing out with a left hook kick in the air, which her opponent was forced to duck.<p>With the momentum shifting back to the redhead, she went into a flurry of kicks, alternating between legs. Many of the kicks were getting through Scarlet's guard, and making themselves slightly known.<p>Ranma idly thought it was like fighting Ryoga back in the day, but she was now making some leeway. She went into a several series of flutter kicks that Scarlet started to back away from.<p>With an enraged scream, the taller woman's guard opened up completely, and she reached and grabbed her opponent's shirt. Like a whip, Scarlet twisted back to her Right and snap-tossed Ranma into the other wall.<p>Ranma peeled from the imprint she made, just in time to duck low as a weight bar with 400 pounds of weight set on it ran into the wall she was against, and kept going. The Redhead then twisted to the side, as Scarlet's fist demolished the rest of the wall that had been behind her, and then jumped away from the side thrust kick.<p>Ranma jumped into the air, with her right leg raised high, intending to bring it down on Scarlet's arm and hopefully sprain it. Scarlet growled, as she twisted her arm so she caught the kick on the inside of her elbow, able to absorb it, and then shifted forward to catch her arm between Ranma's legs. She slammed the redhead down onto the ground, ramming her shoulders into the carpeted floor. Ranma gritted her teeth in pain, and twisted her whole body into an attempt to strain her opponent's arm.<p>The pony tailed woman underestimated Scarlet's strength, as she pulled her arm back up, with Ranma still wrapped around it, and swung it backwards against another part of the wall that was still standing.<p>Ranma let go, dazed, and slumped to the floor; she managed to gain the piece of mind to roll out of the way of a weight crashing down into where her head was. The redhead spun on her back with her leg out, tripping Scarlet, and then kicked out with the other leg to launch the woman away from her. The taller woman landed on one of the weight lifting benches, and caused it to collapse. The time she took to disentangle herself Ranma took to gain her bearings.<p>Scarlet was beyond mad, seeing not much more than her namesake, as she charged again at Ranma, and began attacking even faster than before. The redhead found that she couldn't dodge all the attacks, and had to parry a good few of them, not wanting to meet them in a hard guard.<p>Ranma was given an opening, when Scarlet went for another right cross. Ranma stepped to the outside of the punch, and shot her right hand over it and under her opponent's armpit. The redhead then swung her legs to Scarlet's right side and to her back, while pulling the taller woman's arm into an arm bar. To finish the grapple, Ranma planted her right leg's shin into the other woman's right knee, forcing her to kneel on it.<p>"You see why I left now? I got sick of it all, getting the blame for everything like I was the soul cause of it. What happened the last you saw me was just the final straw." Ranma-chan growled, letting a bit of her own temper slip at once again being blamed.<p>"Bullshit," Scarlet replied through gritted teeth, "You only owned up to something when your hand was caught deep in it." The woman used her enormous strength to pull her arm out of the wrench, brought her left arm back and grabbed the back of the pony tailed woman's head, and tossed her over her shoulder.<p>Ranma landed on the desk Scarlet was sitting at, bumping her head on the remote control, and turning on the monitor again. Both Squeaky and Ranma paused to see what was on the screen.<p>"Akane...?" Ranma enquired, not quite able to hold the amusement from her voice.<p>Scarlet stopped in mid-stride, and her face turned crimson, "WHAT I DO WITH LAV-CHAN AND CHEF-CHAN IS NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!"<p>"Ever thought about selling this?" Squeaky asked, with some awe in his voice, "I would pay good money for a copy of that tape!"<p>"I second that. Did you have to stretch before doing that, Akane?" Ranma studied the position Scarlet was in on the screen.<p>"DIE!" Ranma rolled out of the way just in time to avoid a whole exercise machine landing on the desk an crushing everything that was on it and the desk itself.<p>"NO! NOT THE TV!" Squeaky shouted too late.<p>Ranma and Scarlet went back to trying to beat each other senseless, but this time Scarlet seemed to have a the upper hand. She was in a rage that Ranma was having trouble keeping up with, what with her mind being slightly groggy from being slammed around so many times.<p>Scarlet went swung both her hands to Ranma's sides to trap him with a double chop and then trap her in a bear hug, but the redhead leapt back, and caught both hands in her own. Scarlet attempted a push kick, which Ranma leapt up over and above her opponent while still holding onto her arms. While her body was straight in the air with her feet almost touching the ceiling, Ranma twisted, causing Scarlet's arms to cross, and landed behind the other woman and trapping her arms crossed in front of her while she held onto her wrists from behind and her right knee against the taller woman's back for leverage.<p>"So? I admit it, I was immature, but I've put that behind me. I don't need you or anybody else coming back and drudging up my past just to make my life miserable."<p>"You selfish bastard! You think you deserve peace at the expense of everyone else?" Scarlet shouted. She struggled against the hold, finally raising her left leg up to ram her heel into the redhead's pubic arch. Ranma pulled her knee to the side of it, let go of Scarlet's wrists, and kicked her away with her right leg.<p>Scarlet didn't go far, as she braced her left foot forward down into the floor, digging a furrow into it. Catching Ranma by surprise, she lashed out with a left rising back fist, which lifted the redhead off the floor and sent her flying back.<p>Ranma landed on her back, and bounced onto her stomach before quickly pulling herself to her feet against the wall she was near. She stood up just in time for Akane's right foot to slam into her stomach, and pin her against the wall behind her.<p>"You never understood, did you?" Scarlet stated in a low voice, "We ALL lost everything when you left." Her voice was somewhat pleading and she almost choked at what she said next, "I... regretted the way I treated you, but we loved you. You didn't need to leave"<p>"A... little late for regrets," Ranma managed to grit out through the pain of her ribs being slowly crushed under the pressure.<p>Scarlet's eyes hardened from behind her hair, "Yes, it is." She viciously ground her foot harder, causing the redhead to scream, "Now DIE under my boot like the damn cockroach you are."<p>Ranma began to see spots before her eyes, despite them being closed. The combination of three furious fights, getting slammed around by Scarlet, and her current situation was causing her to black out. She knew it was game over if she lost it. In the back of her mind, she thought Akane had a point, but that didn't mean that Scarlet was the only victim in the ordeal.<p>Focusing as much as possible, Ranma reached back, and strained to unsheathe her right dagger gun. Once it was free, she dragged it quickly across the boot that pinned her to the wall.<p>Scarlet's eyes went wide, and she quickly pulled her leg back and scuttled to the ground. Ranma was hunched over, breathing heavily, and confused at Scarlet's reaction. She didn't even think she had cut all the way through the tough leather of the boot; much less manage anything that caused her to jolt back as she did. Ranma looked up, and blinked at the woman, as she was backed all the way to the other wall, holding her legs tightly in a fetal position.<p>"Uh, hey," Ranma called out nervously, as she approached the other woman, "Are you okay?" Scarlet whimpered at Ranma's approach, and turned away with a frightened and shocked look in her eyes. Ranma-chan raised her eyebrows, and went over to her partner and cut him loose.<p>"Man, she's out of it!" Squeaky stated the obvious, waving his hand in front of the woman's face, as she apparently did not seem to notice her.<p>Ranma tried to hide her concern, "Is Richter back from vacation?"<p>"Uh, yeah, got back this morning I think, had to cut it short."<p>"Good," Ranma said, narrowing her eyes in anger, there was definite hell to pay.<p>She stalked out of the room, with her partner following behind closely. A few seconds later, Squeaky returned to the room, and ejected the tape from the VCR.
