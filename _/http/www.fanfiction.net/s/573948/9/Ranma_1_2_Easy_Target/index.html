</div>Ranma/ The Big Hit<br/>'Easy Target'<p>Ranma walk into the building, and paused, noting there was no heavy force waiting for him. Still weary, he crept down the hall with his dagger guns at ready. He got to the elevator with not so much as a single acknowledgement that he had been spotted, though he knew better, and found a note taped to it;<p>"4th floor room 407, don't keep us waiting!"<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed, and decided to take the stairs to the destined floor. Unfortunately, he found them locked. He backed up, and looked towards the elevator again, and made his decision. They went through too much trouble just to make an easy kill that way, so it's best not to disappoint them.<p>Lavender leaned with her back against the wall and her eyes closed. She lazily opened them once she heard the door open. Ranma walked in and looked at the largesque room with several sizable business desks.<p>"You're twenty minutes late," The woman in the trench coat stated casually, not turning to look towards the pony-tailed man.<p>"Traffic was a bitch," Ranma replied back, "Where's the rest of you guys?"<p>Lavender looked at Ranma from the side of her purple tinted Lennon glasses, before responding, "We decided to take you on all at once was not very sporting. So we drew straws to see who got to pick you apart first.<p>"Gee, aren't you three so kind," Ranma replied dryly.<p>"Not really, I think we all just wanted a chance to rip you apart ourselves, I got the lucky first draw," Lavender turned to look fully at the pony tailed man with an ice cold glare, "and I guarantee you will not get by me."<p>"Confident, aren't ya," Ranma smirked, "If I do, by chance, how am I going to know where to go next?" Lavender reached into her coat, and pulled out an envelope to flash Ranma, and put it back in.<p>The woman pushed herself off the wall, and brushed the side of her trench coat, revealing her two customized Jericho 941s, as if she were a cowboy from a western ready to draw. Ranma noted the action, and reached to the small of his back where his daggers were held upside down in his inverted holsters. He brought them to bear, spinning them by the trigger ring on his index fingers, and stopped the when he crossed them together.<p>Lavender started to stride towards her opponent, pulling out her guns as she did so. As she was closing the distance, she started spinning them on her own trigger fingers. And once she was upon Ranma, she stopped spinning the one on her right hand to where she was only holding the gun by the trigger ring, cocked that hand back, and punched at Ranma with the top of the barrel<p>Kim continued to stare into space, recalling what she had seen almost an hour ago. Yohiko had something important to tell her. They received a call from that weird psycho woman that tried to run them down in a tank earlier. Yohiko got mad, and told her that she had something to take care of. Yohiko started to strip in her living room, almost making Kim swoon. Yohiko turned into Ranma.<p>Stop.<p>Rewind.<p>Play.<p>Yohiko had something important to tell her. They received...<p>Kim shook her head, finally derailing her train from the infinite loop it was placed on. Ranma was saying something to her; something about explaining everything to her later once everything was done.<p>"WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED TO YOHIKO?" Kim screamed out, utterly confused at the sudden inversion of reality. The Korean woman decided that she needed to swing by her friend's house, and wait for her-HIM-HER-WHATEVER so she could receive some explanations.<p>Kim grabbed the extra set of keys Yohiko gave her for times she had to house sit, and walked out of her apartment. She turned down the hall just in time to meet with a gorgeous guy with a brilliant smile.<p>"Miss Hyun?"<p>"What?" Kim snapped, irritated and confused.<p>Ranma parried Lavender's attack with the butt of the dagger in his left hand to the inside, and punched at her with his other dagger butt to the face. The pale lavender tressed woman parried with her left hand and aimed her right gun at Ranma's left shoulder. Ranma quickly turned his shoulder away before the loud bang could sound, and brought his left elbow around and dropped it onto her wrist with the gun. The woman grimaced at the pain that came with the blow, and was forced to lower her gun away to the side. Ranma shot his fist gripping the dagger to the outside out to his opponent's nose. Lavender twisted back to her left with a calm and focused expression on her face, and as she did so, grabbed the left edge of her coat, and quickly sliced up with it. Ranma pulled back in time to receive only a slight cut along his cheek.<p>"That's for bruising my face earlier," Growled Lavender, bringing both her guns to aim. Ranma back flipped away from the gunshots until Lavender stopped firing, it was apparent she wasn't actually trying to kill him just yet.<p>"Would it help if I said 'sorry'?" Ranma enquired with slight mirth.<p>"We're way beyond feeling sorry for each other, 'Airen'," Lavender replied temperamentally, and the struck a kung Fu pose reminiscent of Bruce Lee; a wide stance with her arms held out to her sides and palms up, her back hand was held a bit lower than the other. Ranma gave the woman a crooked smirk, and wiped his nose with his right index finger.<p>The pony tailed man suddenly rushed forward, striking at the woman with the butt of his right dagger. She parried it to the outside with her left arm, and swung at Ranma with her other in a blade hand strike, while holding the edge of her trench coat. Ranma brought up his knee to block the strike from being able to go fully around, and as he set the leg back down, raised the other one quickly for an ax kick. Lavender spun away from the kick, and brought her right gun towards Ranma's head. The pony tailed man twisted quickly back to his left without dropping his leg from the kick, and swung out with his right hand to parry the gun away before the shot rang out. Ranma put his left leg down, and braced himself for the shot to his right open right.<p>Lavender spun her left gun on her trigger finger as she recovered it from making a telling blow to Ranma's face. The pony-tailed man skidded several feet, and rammed his head into a desk. His opponent advanced upon him, and gripped the edge of her coat and swung it into a windmill strike. Ranma swung his left leg to his right, pulling his body away from the razor sharp edge. Lavender turned her right side to Ranma leapt, while twisting her body sideways, and brought the inside of her right foot towards her opponent's head. Ranma pulled his head to the right and his whole body away from the kick, and cart wheeled over the woman's planted leg.<p>Ranma then spun into an outside crescent kick with his right foot, while Lavender spun the same direction opposing him with her right hand holding the bottom of the side of her coat. Ranma saw it in slow motion, as his kick barely missed her face, and her coat just sliced a nick of the man's pants. Ranma had spun to face Lavender before she made it all the way around, and leapt as she continued to spin with her trench coat billowing out.<p>Ranma turned his body horizontally in the air with his knees tucked in, and lashed out with both his feet. Lavender rolled back with the blow, though still catching much of it, and dropped to a sweep, kicking the front legs out from the desk Ranma landed flat on his back on.<p>The pony-tailed man wasn't able to do nothing, as the desk's edge slammed into the ground, causing him to slide a bit along with the desktop's contents. Lavender leapt with her body horizontal, and spun in the air to the left, causing her trench coat to billow out like a razor sharp fan.<p>Ranma rolled off the desk to his right, just in time as his opponent cut it into two where his waist would have been. Recovering quickly, he turned back, and stabbed his left dagger gun into the coat, pinning it to the half of the desk with legs still on it.<p>Lavender growled, and quickly shucked her coat before she could be retaliated against. Ranma was immediately upon her with two left snap kicks to her right side. The pale lavender haired woman countered with two snap kicks of her own with the same leg to Ranma's leg. Shampoo then retaliated by bringing her left gun to Ranma's stomach, in which Ranma used both hands to parry downward as quickly as possible. Ranma didn't have time to gulp, as the bullet just passed between his legs, when Lavender spun her right gun over Ranma's hands, bringing the butt of the handle into his chin. Ranma rolled with the blow into a back handspring, with both feet catching his opponent also in the chin. Lavender also rolled with the blow, and into a backbend, which she turned, into a backhand spring.<p>"You've definitely gotten better," Ranma complimented, wiping the blood from his lip. Lavender didn't answer, instead choosing to attack. Ranma parried the kick to his chest and leapt at her with a forward snap kick. Lavender brushed the blow to the side, rolling along with it, and bringing her left gun to Ranma's right temple.<p>The pony-tailed man smirked, and with amaguriken speed, brought his right hand up to trap the gun against his temple, his pinky finger trapping the hammer back so it could not release. Lavender's eyes went wide in surprise, while Ranma brought his right leg into her guard and started kicking. The woman's body started dancing with the blows, until she was jolted backwards and forced to let go of the gun. Ranma tossed the gun away, ignoring its discharge, and spin kicked her in the face, spinning her around once. Once Lavender made a full turn, he spun around the other direction with another crescent kick. The femme fatal spun the other way around, now fully dazed from the blow, and Ranma grunted with the effort, leaping into the air, and spin kicking back in the first direction, driving his heel into the woman's jaw.<p>With a crunch, Lavender spun into the air like a flying top, and crumpled to the ground some distance away. Ranma landed firmly, swaying slightly in a Capoeira Ginga dance to adjust his balance.<p>Satisfied that the woman was definitely going to be unconscious for a while, he walked over to her trench coat and removed his dagger gun, and the envelope telling of his next destination.<p>"Congrates, Seventh floor, room 700. Hurry up now!"
