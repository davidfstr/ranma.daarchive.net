</div>Ranma/ The Big Hit<br/>'Easy Target'<p>Ranma-chan dropped the Umisenken technique as she leapt from the roof of the moving car. She wiped the water from her face as she jogged to her house, growling about her luck. She had to leave her car behind, since she was sure they were watching for it. Instead she hitched a few rides back.<p>For some reason that eluded her, she was now targeted for a hit, and apparently it was serious enough to bring outside help for it. Of course, luck would be that it would be three of the people who would have sufficient motivation to make good on the contract, either the Gods loved making his life hell with coincidences, or it was intentional.<p>The redhead woman adjusted the much larger clothes, since she was still wearing her 'husband's' wardrobe (his female side had grown a bit, but Ranma had definitely hit a growth spurt), She ran into her house to gather a few things before they discovered she may had went home. It was rather funny, she knew that the last place they would look was back at her home; after all, what idiot would do that when they know they have a contract on their head?<p>Ranma quickly went upstairs to change clothes and pack for both her forms and collect the emergency cash she had stored away for emergencies. After that was done, she went to her walk-in closet, and leapt and rapped her knuckles on the roof of it, causing a swing down door that had a lead box attached to it full of gun ammo; she recovered the ammo, and loaded into the specially insulated portion of her suitcase to avoid detection on a somewhat thorough examination. She then recorded a quick message stating that her and her husband would be gone for an indefinite time on a business trip, and went back downstairs and into the garage to load her car with her luggage. As she got in, she hit the garage door opener so that she could pull out, unfortunately it didn't respond. The redhead grumbled, as she got out of the car, the garage door was jammed from the outside again; she really had to get that fixed.<p>Ranma walked to the front door, and right into the barrel of a lavender Jericho 941.<p>"See?" Lavender replied smugly to her cohorts, as she removed her lavender tinted Lennon glasses.<p>"I can't believe the idiot would ACTUALLY come back home with a contract on their head," Chef rubbed her forehead in disbelief, and removed her own dark amber tinted aviator's glasses.<p>"Well, this IS Ranma we're talking about," Scarlet said with resignation, as she was the last to remove her deep crimson reflective rectangular framed glasses. Lavender poked the gun into the shorter woman's chest, ushering Ranma to move backwards back into the house. Chef went around back, and collected Ranma's dagger guns, patted her down for further weapons, went back to join her associates.<p>"You know? I think this may be the happiest day of my life?" Scarlet replied cheerfully, swiping the hair from the front of her face so Ranma-chan could get a better look at her ecstatic expression.<p>"Huh? I thought that was when..." Lavender started, before she was back fisted in the forehead by Scarlet.<p>"Uh..." Ranma-chan gulped, "Wou-would you like to sit down for some coffee? I have some nice blends."<p>"Sure," Lavender replied.<p>"Sounds good," Chef added in second.<p>Scarlet closed her eyes in exasperation, "Guys, this isn't a pleasure meeting!" But then she let out a resigned sigh, "I guess a few minutes won't hurt."<p>Ranma prepared the coffee, sweating slightly in nervousness from the gun that was still trained on him as the three girls indulged in idle chat.<p>"Ranma really has a lovely place," Lavender replied, doing a peripheral scan of the décor.<p>"Heh, um, th-thanks, Ranma stuttered."<p>"Pretty modest," Chef replied in a slightly condescending tone.<p>"I say we beat her to death," Scarlet stated casually. Ranma tensed at that, from the blows Akane was delivering in their previous fight...<p>"You get carried away," Chef stated calmly, "May as well finish her quickly," she idly reached into her suit and fiddled with one of her throwing blades.<p>"How about we talk about old times, how have you guys been doing for yourselves?" Ranma asked with a jovial nervousness. All three of the 7 Fiancées half glared at the redhead. Ranma gulped again as she served them the coffee, glad for the stalling she was managing to do. The three were pretty confident that they had this job wrapped, if she could only find a way to use it to her advantage.<p>"Great java," Lavender complimented.<p>"Thanks Shampoo," Ranma was quite proud of her coffee. The warm and fuzzy feeling was cut of by a slight clicking of her gun.<p>"I told you, the name's Lavender." Lavender growled.<p>"She's pretty touchy about that, Ranma," Scarlet replied, "What with her being kicked out of the Amazons because of you."<p>"Hey! That wasn't my fault!" The redhead almost shouted back, at the stern looks the other three women were giving her, she calmed down, "and she didn't tell me what her name was until now anyway."<p>"Oh, sorry." Lavender commented sheepishly.<p>"We're spending too much time, let's just gun her down and get going," Chef stated coldly.<p>"Could I have some cream, please?" Lavender asked politely. The doorbell rang a couple of times, drawing everyone's attention to the door.<p>"Get it, and get rid of them," Scarlet commanded the redhead, "And we'll gun you and whoever's at the door if you try anything cute."<p>Ranma nervously got up and walked to the door, as it was rang several more times frantically, "I'm coming, I'm coming, geez!" the redhead shouted out in irritation as she reached the door and opened it to a red eyed Kim, "Huh? Kim?"<p>"Yo-Yohiko..." Kim sobbed, "I really need to talk to you..."<p>"Uh, now's not a good time..." the Redhead started, just then Scarlet came up from behind.<p>"Are you okay?" Scarlet asked in concern.<p>"Uh, she's like this every so often," Ranma replied nervously.<p>"Ranma, she looks horrible!" Chef stated with more emotion than she had given since Ranma had seen her again.<p>"Huh? Ra-Ranma's here?" Kim looked around nervously.<p>"No-no, just me, *Yohiko*, the redhead stated with emphasis, fortunately the girls caught on, "Kim, dear, is it okay if you come back another time?"<p>"I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible," Scarlet stated cryptically, "Come on, dear, tell us what's wrong." With that, Kim was ushered into the front door and into the living room where they were originally sitting. Ranma continued standing and pacing nervously, she couldn't run off, for fear of what would happen to her best friend if she did kept her in place.<p>Kim also continued to stand and was pacing, trying valiantly to hold back the tears, "I, I don't know if I should..."<p>"Go on, we're all friends here," Scarlet replied in an empathic tone. Her two associates nodded.<p>Given the extra strength in her resolve, the distraught woman turned towards Yohiko and started, "Well, I told you that I was going out last night, and I met this guy..."<p>"And he took advantage of you?" Scarlet interrupted, the woman really did seem sweet, she would have to find the guy and beat him to death for upsetting her.<p>"No, no, nothing like that," Kim sobbed, "I, I guess he was very attractive, but I couldn't, I just couldn't click with him, you know?"<p>Yohiko nodded, mentally rolling her eyes; she had heard this many times before from her friend. The girl was extremely picky about her men, in fact, the redhead couldn't recall any moment the woman had a relationship that lasted more than a few weeks.<p>Kim almost started to break down, before she felt Chef's comforting hand on her shoulder. The Korean woman smiled, and continued, "I... I'm just not going to find me the right man!"<p>Yohiko was about ready to start her part of the conversation, the "don't get discouraged, all men are pigs until you've housebroken them; just look at how much effort she had to put into 'Ranma'."<p>"Don't get discouraged, all men are pigs until you've housebroken them, just look how much effort I had to put into Ranma." The redhead replied sympathetically, earning confused looks from the other three girls in company. Now Kim would make a mirthful comment about her worthless 'husband', lighting the mood, and everything would be okay again. Well, except for the fact that she may die soon.<p>"I... I don't know," Kim replied tiredly. Yohiko blinked, this wasn't part of the script, "It's just, it's just that..." The Korean woman finally succumbed to heavy sobbing into her hands.<p>"You'll feel better if you continue," Scarlet stated, rubbing her hand on the small of the crying woman's back. Ranma-chan blinked again at the almost inaudible growls Lavender and Chef were giving off, as their eyes were also narrowed at watching Scarlet 'console' the other woman.<p>Kim looked up in gratitude towards the taller woman, and turned back to Yohiko, "It's, well, I just... well..." Giving up in frustration, Kim quickly pulled Yohiko into a fierce and passionate kiss. Ranma blinked a third, and then a forth time, before she realized what was happening, and started to wave her arms frantically and screeching into the kiss. Kim moaned in appreciation at the vibrations that were being sent into her mouth.<p>"" Scarlet growled; how dare the bitch take advantage of this woman in her time of crisis. Ranma whimpered into the kiss as out of the corner of her eye, Lavender started to take aim...
