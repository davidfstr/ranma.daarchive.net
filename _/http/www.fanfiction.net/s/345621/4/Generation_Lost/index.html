</div><p>Chapter 4 - Resource Conflict</p><p>"Commander Sinclair is being reassigned." Babylon 5, Season  5 Intro.</p><p>Nabiki watched as Gosunkugi left the central  offices.   Only this morning had her sources told her about his imminent  transfer.  The little twerp had been acting very suspicious lately.   Ever  since – well Ranma's disappearance- he had changed from a quite spineless,  creepy guy into a quite self-assured, creepy guy.  It was as if he had a piece  of steel buried deep inside him that had just begun to surface.</p><p>Nabiki did not like this at all.  First  Ranma's disappearance created a power vacuum that destabilized almost all of  her operations and now the spooky boy is getting ready to split also.   As she  walked up to him she noticed his shirt.  It was a black shirt, that had the  English characters "Evil L33t" in a crude scrawl.   He was also wearing a pair  of kakis pants.</p><p>"Hello Gos, aren't you worried about uniform  violations?" she asked.</p><p>Gosunkugi smiled slightly, "Not really as  I'm sure you know today is my last day here."</p><p>"Yes," Nabiki said pausing. The geek  definitely had something up his sleeve but what? And what the hell was  L-thirty-three-T? "I didn't know student exchange programs were set up on the  fly like that."</p><p>"Oh. I had the paperwork on my desk for  weeks.  It's just getting filled in now," he said looking at his watch.</p><p>"Why didn't you tell anyone about this?" she  asked getting irritated he was hiding something, something big.</p><p>"And who would I tell?" Gos said, with a  slight grin, "After all I don't really have any friends."  He then started to  walk away.</p><p>When his back was to her, she said almost  casually, "You know it rains an awful lot in Seattle."</p><p>Gos stopped at this and turned around looking blank.   "Gotcha" Nabiki thought.  "Now I wonder why you'd be going to a school there,"  she said aloud.</p><p>"So you think I somehow hacked into the  record systems of over a dozen different networks, just to get to a rainy  city." Gos said with that smile, which was almost a smirk, back on his face.</p><p>"I think there'd be more than a few people  interested in this little 'trip' of yours"</p><p>"Brilliant move, get a bunch of violent,  obsessed loons frenzied up on some circumstantial evidence and point them in my  direction." Gos said sarcastically, "You know the Kunos and the Amazons might  be desperate enough to fall for that one.  But I wouldn't…." He said trailing  off.</p><p>"And why is that?"</p><p>Gos looked past her, off into the distance,  then spoke, "Funny thing about bank accounts they don't actually hold the  money.  They just keep track of how much you have. Don't you find that  interesting, I mean if someone were to alter the records why that would be  devastating." Gos gave that little smile again. "Fortunately there are  safeguards that prevent that from happening.  Now that everything has been  taken care of here.  I must go."  Gos said as he turned and left Furinkan for  the last time, leaving Nabiki confused, angry and beginning to plot.</p><p>Ranma's eyes opened, noticing first her  current gender and that she was in a blue dress similar to one she had seen  Sarah wearing.  Surrounding her in a rough circle was a thick bank of shadows,  limiting her visibility to a few feet.  She then detected movement just outside  the circle, it was a vague human shape.</p><p>The form then coalesced, into Genma, her  father.  "Look at you I'm gone for little over a month and you revert to this,"  he said pointing at the dress.</p><p>"What the hell are you talking about?" Ranma  asked ignoring the unreality.</p><p>"I raised you to be a man among men."</p><p>"You fucking bastard you didn't raise me at  all.  You kidnapped me," Ranma growled.</p><p>"Her influence would have been  counterproductive." Genma stated.</p><p>"So when you found she wouldn't let you  disappear off into the night, you got her out of the way."</p><p>"You should show more respect for you  father."</p><p>"Respect has to be earned," a new voice  said. Ranma turned to see someone she'd only seen  pictures of.</p><p>"Filthy woman," Genma said to his ex-wife.  "Look at what you've done, and after all I did for you."</p><p>"What I've done?" Nodoka exclaimed. "I was  dead long before you.  And I guess I should applaud you for keeping me in  line."</p><p>"You deserved everything you got."</p><p>"And when I almost had a miscarriage?"</p><p>Ranma watched her dead parents fight.  The  rational part of her brain knew that her subconscious was creating this dream  based on the dossier that lawyer had given her.  While it was never explicitly  said Genma beat his wife, medical records showed that Nodoka had a large number  of "falling accidents."</p><p>"That was your plan from the beginning; use  a loony to get your heir.  She'd be vulnerable enough to push around and if not  she can always be committed."</p><p>"Bitch, I should have taken care of you long  ago," Genma said raising his first.</p><p>Nodoka quickly reached behind her back, drew,  and double-tapped two slugs into his chest.  She then turned to her daughter,  "That should have been done years ago."</p><p>Ranma looked at her father's corpse.  Last  time she saw it, it had to be drug out of a forest.  She then looked back at  her mother.</p><p>"Ranma we have much to talk about," Nodoka  said after holstering her gun.</p><p>A part of Ranma felt that something was  wrong; that the dream( it had to be a dream) was off.  That there was some sort  of interference, but these feelings were quickly overridden .</p><p>After passing through customs Gos ducked  into a bathroom.  A few minutes later a girl with blue hair boarded a domestic  flight.  Her ID was quite legitimate and matched the credit card used to pay  for the domestic flight.  She was listed as 18 year old Erika Berkley born in  Boston, Massachusetts, although in reality she was much younger.  Her plane's  destination was Casper Wyoming.</p><p>Ranma woke up suddenly, almost hitting her  head on the low ceiling that hovered over the bunk bed.  She looked around the  room seeing about half a dozen stuffed heads.  The glass eyes of the hunting  trophies stared back at her.  She then looked down to see her sister on the  computer.</p><p>Ranma couldn't quite make out what she was  doing but the sounds of sporadic gunfire told her that it was some sort of  game.</p><p>"Mission Failure, a hostage has been  killed," a voice from the computer said.</p><p>Sarah pounded her first on the desk while  shouting, "Damn it Dan!  Stop being a fucking spawn muncher."</p><p>"There's no respawning in Rogue Spear," Dan  shouted from the other side of the wall.</p><p>"Yes but there is an insertion point and an  extraction point."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"So you just sit there and shoot up my team  when the mission starts and then snipe the hostages just when I'm about to get  them to safety."</p><p>"Look all I'm doing is playing my best."</p><p>Ranma squinted trying to adjust to the  arguing cousins.</p><p>Sarah tuned around noticing her sister was  awake, "Oh sorry sis."</p><p>If Ranma had been slightly more conscious  she would have been annoyed by the comment.</p><p>"Sis?" Allison asked from the same room.</p><p>"Yeah for some reason she insisted on  sleeping that way," Sarah said while planning the next mission. "I don't know  might be a Japanese thing."</p><p>Again if Ranma had been listening she would  have objected, but right now she was trying to remember a dream she had last  night.  She knew both her parents were in it, but everything else was fuzzy.</p><p>"Wait a minute," Sarah said. "What are you  doing in there Allison?"</p><p>"Um well I'm.." Dan's girlfriend trailed  off.</p><p>"Allison?" Sarah asked, then repeated her  name slightly louder.</p><p>"She just stepped out," Dan yelled back.</p><p>Sarah heard the door click open then fall  shut. When she turned around she didn't see anyone else.  She then saw the  closet door slide open. "Allison I know you're in here."</p><p>Ranma looked down from her bed.  She could  just make out some quicksilver shimmering from inside the closet.</p><p>After the plane landed in Casper, Erika  waited in the tarmac.  She had a vague description of what Germ Forge looked  like and waited for him to pick her up.</p><p>Sean was nervous as he walked into the  tarmac.  Until a few days ago he had a semi-normal life as a programming  engineer, hacker, and resident of Lockridge, but then his car was attacked by a  bunch of, scifi loons (well Sean couldn't really judge them after all he had a  template too), and now one of his long time contacts was asking to meet him in  person, and then crash at his apartment.  Sean did not like this, one of the  cardinal rules of hacking was to never meet a contact in real life.  It was  considered to be a security risk.  But Sean owed Spore and was obligated to  help.</p><p>Another thing that irked him was that Spore  knew that he looked like, but Sean had no idea what Spore looked like.  All he  had was a time and a terminal.  As he walked around the concourse, he caught  movement from the corner of his eye.  He turned to see a girl maybe  16 or 17,  Japanese with a blue dye job.  Sean noted she was wearing a short chainmail  skirt over a black leotard or something, that fit her nicely.</p><p>"Did you see CNN last night?" she asked.</p><p>Sean kept his face neutral that was the  first part of the authorization code.  "Yeah the President gave a press  conference," he replied</p><p>"Was the attorney general with him?" she  inquired.</p><p>That's part two, Sean noted. "Yeah, but I  think the last one was better?"</p><p>"You mean Reno?" she said, smiling.</p><p>"Hello, Spore.  I thought you were a guy,"  putting out his hand</p><p>"Um kinda." Erika replied tentatively  shaking his hand after a static shock.</p><p>Sean raised an eyebrow at this.</p><p>"Look I'll explain on the ride over."</p><p>"Right," Sean said walking back to his car.</p><p>After pulling the nozzle out of his now full  tank Dan walked into the Quick Stop.  He saw Allison talking to the two clerks.  "All I'm saying is that the workers on the deathstar in Jedi, knew what they  were getting into. I mean you're taking a risk when you work for the evil  empire."</p><p>The one with the goatee turned to the one in  the hat, "See I told you Randal."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, yeah, same thing that roofer  said."</p><p>"Hey Dante," Dan said walking up next to his  girlfriend. "Pump number 2"</p><p>"Right," he said taking Dan's debit card.</p><p>"Isn't it your day off?" Dan asked.</p><p>Dante just slumped his head on the counter.</p><p>"Cheer up, at least here you don't have to  deal with burn boy and lunchbox." Allison said leaving.</p><p>"I can't believe you got them to do that,"  Dan said after exiting the door.</p><p>"I had to take a hit of counteragent  though," Allison pointed out.</p><p>"We've got to fix that damn gland," Dan  commented.</p><p>"As long as I'm careful," Alison said  showing the small, currently green, Ouroboros tattooed to her wrist.</p><p>"You won't go crazy," Dan observed opening  the driver's door to the Beast. After getting into his seat he turned to see  the two glaring redheads.  When Allison entered one of them started to growl.   After examining her face, Dan was surprised to see that it was Sarah.</p><p>"You will die very slowly," Sarah grumbled,  while Ranma seemed to have zoned out.</p><p>"How the hell did you get them both in  Catholic schoolgirl uniforms?" Dan asked.</p><p>Allison smiled, "Lets just say it took a lot  of quicksilver."</p><p>"Why?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Glad to see you're with us again," Dan  said. "But still why did you do that?  I mean do you have a thing for that  stuff."</p><p>"Are you interested?" Allison smiled.</p><p>"Maybe later," Dan said pulling his truck  onto the road.</p><p>"As for why I did it these were the only  clothes Sarah had more than one set of."</p><p>"Well it's your damn fault I even have these  things." Sarah said.</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma inquired, slightly more  coherent.</p><p>"You see before the beginning of the school  year Allison convinced Sarah, that our high school was switching to uniforms."  Dan said turning down another road. "I still don't know how you did that," he  told Allison.</p><p>The blonde just smirked.</p><p>"Why the hell do you keep playing this  stuff," Erika asked while Sean drove down Route 220 South to Lamont.</p><p>"Wait I thought you were from Boston," Reno  said moving into the right lane.</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"This is the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. You  know the Boston based, Ska band."</p><p>"Oh, well I spent most of my time at MIT,"  Erika replied.</p><p>"I though you were 18?" Sean said.</p><p>"Yes, well I had many older friends," Erika  fumbled.</p><p>"Of course," Sean said, before pulling the  car off onto the shoulder. He then shut the car off, pulled the keys out and  slipped out the door.</p><p>Erika turned to see him leaning against the  guardrail. "What's going on?" she asked standing next to him.</p><p>"See that ridge of mountains we're about to  pass through." Sean said pointing to a range of peaks a few miles down the  road.  Erika nodded.  "You know what the continental divide is right.  Well  that range is a little bubble in the line. Called the Great Divide Basin, it's  a region three and a half thousand square miles in size, where rainwater drains  in neither ocean.  Lockridge is inside it."</p><p>"Point being?"</p><p>"Spore was the better hacker, I mean he did  do that little IRS thing for me, and apparently he's the better coder…" Sean  said trailing off.</p><p>Erika looked over at Sean, her face  questioning.</p><p>"Don't be so naïve, you think he could  obtain the holy grail of computing and keep it a secret." Sean said.</p><p>"Now my question is, if I ran your prints  whose would I get."</p><p>"It wouldn't matter," Erika responded.</p><p>"True we both know how mutable record banks are."  Sean said, fiddling with his keys.</p><p>"So now what?"</p><p>"You tell me what the hell's been going on,"  Sean said, hoping that the explanation would answer something.</p><p>Entering the student lounge Rebecca spotted  Winston at his laptop.  Ned appeared to be engrossed in his game, although that  his I/O sphere was plugged in seemed odd. "God, did you spend all night playing  that game?" she said noticing the dark rings under his eyes and the large  cappuccino sitting next to his comp.  If she had not spent all night up working  herself, she would have noticed the small necklace Ned was wearing.</p><p>"Yeah so," Winston said, pausing Max Payne.   "It looks like you've stayed up too."</p><p>Sitting down at the chair across from  Winston, she spoke "Yeah, I was watching this weird show, Voltron, I think it's  called."</p><p>Ned nodded before returning to his laptop.</p><p>"Damn,"  Dan said pulling into the school's   lot. "I hate the parking in this place."</p><p>"You know the front lot fills up quick."  Alison stated searching for a space, "I mean that's why we get here so early,  normally."</p><p>"Well we would have been here earlier if you  hadn't had your fun," Dan said as he drove past the building and into the lot  behind the sports fields.</p><p>"So what?  We walk a few extra minutes."</p><p>Dan shrugged, and pulled the beast into an  open space.  Getting out he looked back at the school sitting in the distance.</p><p>Rebecca's eyebrow raised. Interesting, all  the pieces were in place, but the plan was still vague.   Lately she had just  been doing what seemed most amusing but this was not ideal for the long term.   Even last night's work had been spontaneous.  It had happened after looking at  the data from the standing circle and some schematics Ned had sold her.</p><p>She sighed and activated the program.  Knowing the most likely outcome, but considered the loss of a prototype worth  the potential intelligence.   Hearing Ned packing his computer, Rebecca looked  up. "Leaving so soon?  But class isn't for ten minutes."</p><p>Putting on a leather jacket that went to mid  thigh, Winston slipped the laptop into a harness style pocket.  Bearing a  strange likeness to a large holster, it allows heavy or bulky objects to be  stored and concealed. "Yeah I've got some stuff I need to do." He said walking  out of the lounge.</p><p>Rebecca shrugged and went back to her  computer.</p><p>"This really sucks," Ranma said, glaring at  her short, plaid pleated-skirt.</p><p>"Yes, and since neither of us has gym this  semester, we have nothing to change into," Sarah said walking next to her  sister. "Well played," she said to Alison.</p><p>"I try my best," Alison responded looking  back into the wooded foothills behind the school.</p><p>"What?" Dan asked.</p><p>"Huh?  Nothing, just thought I saw  something."</p><p>Leaving the second floor bathroom, Ned  looked out the window seeing four people walking across the soccer field.  Looking past them he spotted a familiar shimmer at the base of the tree line.</p><p>He watched as the shimmer gained definition and started to  move. "Oh fuck," Ned said looking at his necklace.</p><p>"So you study for you're chemistry test  today," Sarah asked Ranma.</p><p>"I'll do fine, I guess," Ranma said, then  hearing breaking glass looked up. "What the…"</p><p>"Fuck it," Ned said just before jumping  through the window.  Landing on the first floor roof, he proceeded to run off  it.  Hitting the ground in a roll, Winston jumped up, swallowing the contents  of a pill bottle while running. "At least that part works," he thought after  noticing his sustained damage diminish.</p><p>"Get into your templates." Ned shouted  pulling out his grenade launcher.</p><p>Dan shifted into his template, pulling out  his guns, "Winston what the fuck's going…"</p><p>Ned fired.  The shell was lobbed over the  four teens and into an empty area of the back lot.   It hit the ground, sending  out a fireball followed by a small shockwave.  Both seemed to be deflected by a  rather large invisible object.</p><p>Now in her power armor, Sarah detected the  anomaly faintly.  Allison had also shifted, her clothing changed into a set of  fatigues, boots, and some sort of large gun.  Going with the flow, Ranma  changed too, entering her template. "I hate this thing," Ranma growled now  wearing a school uniform, fuku style, much worse than the one Allison had  forced her into.</p><p>Standing on high-heeled boots she clenched  her hand, her now long and painted, fingernails digging into her palms; the  runes in her braces starting to glow.  She could feel the jewelry, the pieced  ears, how her hair had been changed, but most of all her wings.  She could feel  through them, even in their compact form where they were just little angel  wings.  Ranma started to grind her teeth.</p><p>"Um sis?" Sarah asked, just before Ranma  screamed, extended her wings to their full state, and jumped up into the air.</p><p>Something from the distortion became  visible.  Containing several slits on the face of it, the thing resembled the  end of an arm.   What seemed to be a stream of an almost liquid metal shot out  of the slits at Ranma. Pulling her wings back she dropped into a dive right at  the thing, firing right at the streams in thick red rays from her bracer-amps.  When cut, the unattached lines of metal fell to the ground.</p><p>"Allison," Dan said, to which the blonde  quicksilvered and went invisible.</p><p>Ned was now almost even with Dan and Sarah,  still carrying his M-79 grenade launcher. He fired another round just to the  left of the visible portion. Again it hit and carried that strange deflection.  "Damn as long as it's invisible, we're screwed,"  Ned said to Dan, after Sarah  had taken off to cover Ranma.</p><p>"It's being taken care of.  Shall we?" Dan  asked switching to an armor-piercing clip for his Uzis.</p><p>"Right," Ned said, pulling out his twin  Ingrams, a gun very similar to Dan's.</p><p>Rebecca watched the fight from her laptop,  although anyone looking over her shoulder would see a meaningless jumble of  green characters moving in a window.   It was one of many tricks she picked up  from that movie.  She'd used it for so long she didn't even see the code, but  images and senses more intricate that could be produced by a mere monitor, for  it was her mind's eye that translated it.</p><p>Ned's involvement was a unexpected but  understandable complication. Oh well.  This fight would also be test trial for  the new routines she had added to Ranma's template.  She was curious as to  whether the self-adaptation routines she found would work.  They were  notoriously vague and buggy things, the main reason that they were not used in  templates.</p><p>"Okay," Ranma thought rolling over to avoid  another group of  liquid metal spikes.   "Sarah's behind  me providing cover,   Dan and that other guy are gunning interference, and Allison's disappeared.   Meanwhile this thing only makes its weapons visible just long enough to fire,  allowing us to only take in a few shots, and this thing isn't giving of ANY ki  something that every magical construct, living person, and appliance lager than  a toaster possess to some extent."  Scanning the last place she saw the thing,  she pulled her wings and went into a steep ascend. Ranma then looked over to  her sister.</p><p>Standing almost vertical elevated by her  jumpjets, Sarah shook her head.  Her onboard sensors could only get echoes and  static. Sarah looked don to see Winston and Dan almost back to back waiting,  knowing that a fluid lance could appear at any moment, and that dodging would  be difficult at best.  Dan had already taken a glancing blow, exposing his  template's cybernetic endoskeleton just bellow his right ribs.  At least Ranma  and herself had three dimensions to maneuver in.</p><p>"I wish I could see the bastard," Ranma  thought, waiting for the next wave.  A strange compulsion then developed, that  if she wanted to she could have something that would do just that.  The winged  girl then felt the urge to say something.  Giving in, she uttered the words:  "Rose Hand Mirror Activate!"</p><p>Shuddering Ranma looked down to see a small  almost pinkish compact mirror resting in her left hand. "One step closer to  being a fucking princes," she muttered.  It's surface had roses inscribed in  the circumference and when she flipped it open, one half contained the standard  mirror that doubled as a miniature view screen and the other had the mix of  small buttons, that looked like makeup despite being plastic. Centered on it  was a large humanoid shape with arrows and stats pointing to various points.</p><p>Noting the status meter pointing to the left  arm of the thing change, she dodged  another volley of  spikes.   Finding  severe awkwardness of having to hold the thing in battle, Ranma received  another compulsion.  After saying, "Rose Glasses, Activate!" a pair of slim  rose tinted shades appeared over her eyes, providing an overlay similar to that  of the mirror that had disappeared again, although with these there were no  controls.  Now armed with an unobtrusive way of seeing the enemy Ranma, dove at  it, aiming her twin beams at points the glasses highlighted.</p><p>"Oh god there's more crap," Sarah though  seeing her sister summon various artifacts.    She then noted that Ranma did  seem to be able to see the invisible enemy.  Shrugging she followed her sister  in.</p><p>While covering Winston's clip reload, Dan  noticed Ranma nimbly dance around the metal tendrils (barely), avoiding spikes  that's power Dan knew all to well, while the powerful shots from her bracers  were impacting with something.  He saw Sarah providing support alternating between  firing at the same spot as Ranma and cutting some of the liquid blades.   Dan  raised his arm till it was vertical then quickly pulled it down.</p><p>Seeing the signal Allison stepped forward.   Thankful for the fresh shot of counteragent, she had tried to shadow the thing  while staying undetected.   Because a quicksilvered human eye could see above  and below the visible spectrum, but not in it( for quicksilver bends that range  of light rendering invisibility), Allison could also see what she was up  against.</p><p>Tacking her gun, she fired  five shots in  quick succession.   Hitting various points, the sticky bombs gripped onto some  flexible cloak covering the thing.  Allison backed off again while the fuse  delay counted down.</p><p>Dan  paused when several explosions erupted  around the object.  "Holy-fuck it's a mech in a cape," he said when the smoke  cleared revealing the machine surrounded by a now holed fabric.</p><p>"Yes, a cloak of invisibility," Winston  said, pulling out his sniper riffle.  Quickly shouldering the weapon, "Ah Balgus  if you only knew," he said before centering on a grill in the head of the  mech.  Ned fired sending the slug right into the cockpit of the guymelef.   Which if the mech had a pilot, would have been a fatal head wound.</p><p>"So it's a bot," Dan said getting out his  missile launcher.</p><p>"Or remote controlled," Winston said  following suit with his grenade launcher.</p><p>"On three," Dan said motioning with his  hand.</p><p>After catching the signal, Allison readied  her weapon.  When the timer ran down each fired.   The three missiles lobbed  over to the head of the mech, and hit.  The explosion knocked a large section  of its head off.   At that moment Ranma, high above the guymelef flipped into a  steep dive.  The powerful beams from her amps entered the smoking neck hole,  cut through the mech's innards, and burst out hitting the ground.</p><p>The machine used one of its arms to try and  hit Ranma, but she was able to twist around the  liquid blades. Although the  closer she kept her wings the less maneuverability she had.  With it's other  arm the mech extended its  blades into a long arc which it tried to sweep  across the field.</p><p>Dan had two choices dodge or fire.  He knew  he would be hit first and that time was short, but Dan still carefully aimed  his launcher at the end of the arm that generated the approaching blade.  After  the missile was released he twisted his body back and down, pulling the missile  launcher up as a protective measure.  The missile hit the vents where the metal  was released, destroying the apparatus.  The giant scythe started to fall and  lose cohesion, just before it impacted with Dan.  It cut the missile launcher  near the handle, slashed his left arm in a long oblique gash midway between his  elbow and wrist, passed over his head, and fell to the ground in a mercury-like  splash.</p><p>"Oh Fuck," Dan said when he fell onto his  back.  The broken launcher lay on either side of him.  He cybernetics were  working on sealing the stump.  The wound was sickeningly uniform and level,  clearly showing his endoskeleton, musculature, and various other components.   He picked up his head and looked mournfully at his arm, still in the sleeve of  his coat, laying in the grass.  His template could repair most injuries (like  self inflicted knife wounds), but it had never occurred to him to code in full  amputation, at least his internal systems could block the pain, shock, and  blood loss.</p><p>One handed, he loaded a clip of armor  piercing rounds into a Uzi and racked it.</p><p>Ranma continued her decent , until she was  even with the burnt remainder of the mech's head.  Grabbing onto the twisted  metal surrounding the exposed hole into the machine, she folded back her  wings  and flipped over, hitting the thing's chest with her boots.  A small icon  appeared on her glasses tracking form left to right she turned to see it mach  the path of a missile destroying the mech's left arm.</p><p>She also sensed blades coming in from the  other arm.  She let go falling down the side of the mech her bracers holding  off the transient edges.  When she hit the ground she leapt back to gain some  distance, and saw Dan firing one-handed, his other arm ending in a slowly  dripping stump.   She focused on  the mech, the readouts displayed on her  glasses, moving from point to point.  As the readouts changed, Ranma dove  forward.</p><p>"What the hell's she doing?" Allison asked  standing near Dan after confirming that he was mostly alright.  Her weapon was  raised, but she couldn't fire in fear of accidentally hitting the redhead.   Winston, out of grenade shells, had switched to his Ingrams, and Dan was  reduced to one of  his Uzis.  Neither weapon, despite using special rounds, was  producing much effect.</p><p>Sarah dropped to the ground in between Ranma  and the others.  Her plasma riffle was shouldered and aimed at the mech's chest.   She looked  down to see Ranma rushing forward. "What in God's name," she said,  giving cover fire.</p><p>Ranma ran in towards the mech, who responded  by shooting its  metal spikes straight out.  Ranma dodged, then in midair  changed directions, flipping over, under, and between the quasi-solid blades.  Ranma had  managed to get near the machine again, only this time she was under  it. Dual beams shot out, hitting the mech's legs an underside as she passed  beneath it.</p><p>Once she was behind it she briefly touched  the ground, before leaping back up.  The mech's body and arm was swiveling  around lining up for another try.   Ranma's glasses had formed a crosshair on a  specific spot on the mech's midsection.  Her bracers charged and fired, this  time the twin beams of amplified chi had formed extremely narrow and focused,  merging into each other midway to target.</p><p>The blades shot out at Ranma, who was  hovering perfectly still while the beam burnt through several layers of  armor.   As the blades got closer  the runes on her bracers changed slightly.   About half a dozen new beam shot out of the bracers, intersecting with the  liquid blades.</p><p>"Dear lord," Ned said, observing  the fuku clad redhead.  The mech was desperately trying to dislodge her attack,  by both moving itself and  sweeping with its one remaining blade device.   But  no matter how hard it tried winged girl kept in the same position.   "Wait," Winston thought, "What's so critical about that one  spot? I mean she won't move and the mech's adamantly trying to stop her.  And  Why hasn't it burned through yet?" An then it fell into place.   "Jesus," Winston shouted, "Get back and get down it's gonna  blow."</p><p>The beam then burned past the final layer of  containment amour and into the mech's power core (a calash coded device used in  golems (magically supplemented robots) as an energy source).   When the beam  hit the interior of the core, it destroyed several of the containment locks,  causing and uncontrolled cascading reaction. The mech's safety cutoff  system  activated to try and shut down the reactor, but the countermeasures were  damaged and Ranma was still pouring energy into it.</p><p>A blazing sphere of energy burst out if the  of mech. It grew to a radius of about 4 feet, the beam of red energy still  being pumped into it. Winston unable to keep down looked at the ball.  It hung  there part inside and part outside of the mech.  The machine had gone still;  its computers most likely having seized up.  Ned was confused he knew that when  a core when critical it blew up.  He then studied the sphere it was almost as  if something was containing it.</p><p>Using the scope on his sniper rifle he  studied the point where the red beam met the sphere.  His eyes widened in  comprehension.  Instead of impacting with the sphere. The beam split, and encircled  the blast containing it.  He then saw the red grid was breaking down.  The  energy form the core leaking out.   The gaps grew.  "Fuck," Ned muttered.   "Again Get Down!" he shouted as the blast ripped through the red shell.</p><p>Ranma had felt the template change, her body  change, during the fight. Unlike other templates that had to be coded to match  the user, that had to be upgraded manually, hers would grow and change, bonding  with her, improving her, as need be.  Unfortunately  it had limits, she could do  intercepts, barley, but that containment proved to be too much.  The template  told her she could do it.  That is would upgrade itself to compensate.</p><p>"That was a lie," Ranma thought before  hitting the ground, the pain of the impact accompanied by another pain, it was  a tingling, stabbing almost draining sensation.    It was her template's script  debuggers, trying to fix the hastily written code that had increased her speed,  agility, sense perception, and bracer manipulation.</p><p>The original code had produced  numerous memory leaks, misplacing energy and data.  While small, the problems  grew exponentially over time.  Small errors building on each other. Ranma lost  consciousness as her body tried to fix itself.</p><p>Rebecca smirked at the explosion on computer  screen.  She has considered this test an acceptable success.  Now only has she  gotten some supporting evidence that the organic template technology could  actually work (that naive girlfriend of Spore had no idea what she had stumbled  onto), shown that this design of golems had some promise, but she had  discovered the tactical limitations of four potential enemies' templates.  Yes  today was a good day.</p><p>"What just happened?" Allison  asked, covered in a light metal dusting.</p><p>"I think we just won," Ned said,  getting up. He looked over to see a rather large shard of metal impaled into  the ground nest to him.</p><p>"What if there's more," Sarah  asked scanning the tree line.</p><p>"If there was, they would have attacked  by now," Dan said, then at Winston, "You know what this thing  is?"</p><p>"Give me a moment" Ned started to walk  around, looking at various bit of metal, mumbling to himself</p><p>"Hey Ranma you okay?" Sarah asked.</p><p>The unconscious redhead muttered something  unintelligible.</p><p>"Oh god." Sarah  walked up to Ranma.  She  was laying on the ground her wins spread out under her.  "She's changed  again,"  Sarah said noticing the slight costume change</p><p>The runes on her amps had changed into a  more recognizable pattern, looking almost like thorny vines.   Her earrings had  changed to little gold dangly roses.  A ring had also appeared on her finger,  instead of a stone it was a small piece of polished white bone, with a single  rose scrimshawed in it.  The etchings were in two colors. The ink for the stem  was a dark, almost black, green, and the petals themselves were inked in blood  red.  However the most noticeable change was her choker, embedded in the front  of it was and egg-shaped piece of glass, and frozen perfectly inside it was a  single, rather small, rose.</p><p>"She hurt?" Dan asked.</p><p>"I don't think so," Sarah responded.  "Here  breathing's normal and all.  Its like she's in a deep sleep, and won't wake up"</p><p>"Odd.  Think the fight might've drained  her."</p><p>"Could have. I mean this is the first combat  that Ranma's had with the template, and we really don't know anything about  it."</p><p>"True"</p><p>"What about you?  You lost an arm."</p><p>Holding the recently truncated limb Dan  responded, "Yeah, I think I'll be okay when I revert out of my  template."</p><p>"Whatever you say."</p><p>"What do you think?" Dan asked Ned.</p><p>"Based on recent happenings, I'd  have to  agree, she's probably just drained.  Give her a few hours and she'll be fine.   As versatile those beams of hers are, ( I mean, cutting, piecing, explosive,  weapons of various sizes and intensities, and a shield-like interception  ability), they do have limits." Turning to Ranma specifically  "I'd imagine  that the shield was really draining, intercepting all those hits.  As to why  she even tried to contain the explosion…"</p><p>"Any idea as to why the costume changed?"  Allison asked</p><p>"Don't know, although the changes seem to be  superficial."</p><p>Dan sighed. "And what about the mech. I mean  only a few people work with golems, fewer still are good enough to make that."</p><p>"This mech was based on a certain type of  guymelef. A mech from an anime called Escaflowne.  Whoever did this made some  modifications, but yeah, the root is mine."</p><p>"So the same person that stole that temp,  also stole the design to make that golem. If the same person was behind both,"  Dan proposed. "Any idea who could do this?" Dan asked.</p><p>Ned's response was automatic.  It was all  part of the deal he had made with Rebecca, except now he was even more wary of  reprisal. There was something very disturbing about that girl, and after all it  wasn't his fight. "Nope, although whoever did this must have been one hell of a  hacker. I only got the slightest tinge of a security breach."</p><p>"That fits the pattern," Dan said.</p><p>"No problem," Ned said, but a small voice  was nagging him.  If this wasn't his fight then why did he come  and help  them.</p><p>Dan looked back to see a woman leaving the  school walking towards them. "Damn it's the VP."</p><p>"You guys go, I'll take care of this," Ned  stated.</p><p>"Are you sure?" Dan said, looking at the  approaching administrator.</p><p>Ned turned to the debris, "Yup."</p><p>"Thanks again," then at the others, "Saddle  up we're going back to the barn. "</p><p>"Can I drive?" Alison asked.</p><p>"Sure, it's no like you suck anymore. Sarah  can you carry Ranma?   I'll help but."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, one arm," the power suit  wearing redhead said, as she picked up her sister.</p><p>Standing next to the crater, Ned closed his  eyes.  He felt the Beast rumble as it powered up, then the distinct wine if a  turbine.  Opening his eyes he saw the large black shape pass, then he looked over  to see the administrator's final approach.</p><p>Judy Miller, was not a happy educator.   Unlike most of her coworkers, she couldn't lean back and let things slide.   Unlike those lazy teachers, she had to provide some semblance of order.   Granted this was Lockridge and some compromises had to be made, but this was  taking things too far.    "Well, well Mr. Winston I seems your friends have  ditched you.   I would have expected more from the sheriff's daughter and her  friends but…"</p><p>"I told them to go. It wasn't their fault."</p><p>"Well you could explain what happened then,  because all I know is that, a very large, possibly dangerous, machine tore up  the back fields while fighting with some students.  Now I know you posses  expertise in such things."</p><p>"I just saw  this thing advancing on my  fellow students and I went to help."</p><p>Miller gave s tight lipped smile, "So you  were just helping out, that isn't like you."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"And there's also the weapons discharge on  school grounds."</p><p>"You know how the town council enforces  laws.  The response was justified."</p><p>"Depends, was this," she points at the  scattered debris, "your responsibility?"</p><p>Ned reverted out of his template, making the  weapons disappear.</p><p>"Well it doesn't matter.  I'm sure an  examination of the hardware will reveal its origins."</p><p>"I don't think whoever did this would be  that sloppy."</p><p>"True"</p><p>"Not that it was my doing."</p><p>"Of course it wasn't.  Seeing as the net  damage was minimal, I'm willing to offer a deal.  You clean up this mess, and  we'll call it even."</p><p>Ned considered it. He could use the raw  materials.  He also had a means of  transporting the goods to his workshop.  A  couple tones of metal in return for some landscaping and shipping. "Sure I'll  fix the field, and dispose the stuff."</p><p>Miller nodded. She hated having to  constantly cut deals, but uncompromising enforcement was not an option.   She  couldn't even keep truancy down. Oh well at least most of the little monsters  were wiling to be diplomatic about it.</p><p>Ned nodded in return.</p><p>"Why are we still in our templates, and  why'd we just leave?" Sarah asked, trying to get Ranma  comfortable in her  seat, even in their compact form, her wings refused to lie flat enough.</p><p>"Because," Dan said, while Allison forced  the truck around a curve. "Someone tried to kill us, hurt us, or do something,  and we need to be ready.  That's why we're going back home.  We can regroup  there and plan our next move."</p><p>"And what will that be?" Allison asked.</p><p>I don't know was Dan's response, as they  continued to drive home.  They were about to turn onto  the driveway when  Allison noticed a car sitting in front of the garage.  It was a familiar red  Honda.  Cautiously the they drove up ready to leap out, if need be.  As they  got closer two people leaning along the vehicle became visible.  One of them  all knew, the other only Ranma would have been able to identify.</p><p>Rebecca was sitting at the back porch of her  house, working at her laptop.   Ned was a conundrum.  She didn't care if he  helped the others, just as long as he kept his end of the agreement.  His  actions were just curios.  She was pleased with this latest bit of today's  progress(although there were still many unaccounted variables to be found), and  was putting the final touches on her next project.  Unfortunately these protocols  were radically different than those in on subject 1 and couldn't be implemented  without interfering with other trials already under development.  She needed  another body to imprint.   Although finding one with the right potential would  be difficult.</p><p>She lived alone.  Her parents died in a  plane crash two years ago.  Afterward she had been in the care of an aunt from  Arizona.  When she turned 17 she petitioned the town council to giver her adult  status.  Considering the uniqueness that is Lockridge and the proximity to 18  her request was granted.  The aunt was all too relived to go back to the  normality of Phoenix.</p><p>This made it all the more unusual when her  inner perimeter sensors were tripped.  The cameras  showed a hiker, Asian,  male, perhaps a year younger than her.  Obviously not going for stealth, it  intervened her as to how he could've slipped past the outer perimeter.</p><p>The wooded path that he was following would  shortly bring him to the hilly meadow that tumbled down  behind her house.  She  set he I/O sphere on long range ready to scan as soon as he got in range.  The  results were surprising.</p><p>In addition to having to potential for  Calash, the hiker had two other bits of magic coded in him.  One seemed to do  something to point of location, but it was trivial, the other however was very  similar to that of subject 1.  Rebecca smiled.  This was too convenient, again  a suitable subject had fallen right into her hands.  Although the first time  she hadn't realized the importance of what she'd done.</p><p>She would talk to the boy see what he wanted, what he  desired.  She would then give it to him, with more than a few strings attached.</p><p>What she would find is a boy desperate for  cures and revenge.  And more than willing to make a deal.</p><p>Thanks to my Pre-readers, who made this chapter what it is</p><p>S.
