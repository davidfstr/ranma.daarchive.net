</div><p>Chapter 6 – Release  Dates</p><p>"I see a great hand  reaching out of the stars." Babylon 5, Season 5 Intro.</p><p>The Winston compound was to the west of Lockridge. It was  positioned on the end of Teakettle Ridge, a jutting finger of land that crept  out of the mountains that surrounded the area. Instead of gently slopping into  the valley, Teakettle ended abruptly with a plateau bordered by a crescent of  cliffs. The Winston compound was on this plateau.</p><p>One of the first structures built in the area: the  compound was originally Fort Teakettle. Over the course of over two hundred  years, its been a trading post, small mountain hamlet, military base,  monastery, logging site, and recently the cooperate retreat for Winston  Industrial Container. It was an expedition from Fort Teakettle that discovered  the standing circle and founded Lockridge.</p><p>Robert Winston owner of WIC may have moved the main offices  to Cheyenne when the corporation went big, but his heart was still in the region.  Maintaining the compound was the responsibility to the Winstons that stayed  behind, a full time job considering the compound consisted about dozen  buildings each having been modified or added on to over time. Perched on the  abrupt end of the ridge the collection of stone structures looked almost like a  castle.</p><p>Out of its field, Winston Industrial Container is  overlooked and dismissed. However in the field of demolitions salvage and  refuse container leasing, it is considered innovative and groundbreaking. Its  size alone was amazing, for it controlled almost all of the Northern half of  the Rockies, and is still growing. WIC has few competitors that could even come  close to matching it. The downside is that WIC is very much a niche company,  limited to its region and field. Granted it was very successful, but Robert  wanted more. Which was why he gave his grand nephew an open door to company  recourses. Too old to be proficient in Calash himself, but he fully understood  the power it represented. In time Winston Industrial Container will branch out  into a very new field.</p><p>Ned's apartment was in the second floor of the South  building. Consisting of a bedroom, bathroom, living room, and kitchen nook, it  was a bit smallish, but it was his. There was another apartment on the floor  belonging to his younger sister Julie. Their father had died when they were  both young, an accident involving a dumpster that was improperly tied down, and  until recently they had lived in the main house, a building in the center of  the compound with their mother. She then got transferred to HQ in Cheyenne. Neither  of her children wanted to leave Lockridge, and with the promise that their  relatives would watch them, they were allowed to move into the South building,  normally reserved for vacationing WIC executives, and clients the corporation  was entertaining.</p><p>The compound also had an auditorium, several conference  rooms, a small theater, a bar and restaurant, a little grocer's store, several  suites and overnight rooms, a physical plant with backup generators, a large  garage and repair shop, a motor pool with snow ploughs and other company  vehicles, and a helipad for those who wish to be flown in. Fairly isolated and  self contained, it was the perfect place for a vacation executive wanting to  get away, or any one else. In the right circles, WIC is notorious for taking  prospective clients on expansive hunting or fishing trips.</p><p>The compound is also useful for business conferences and  industry summits. The compound was Robert Winston's ace in the hole. One didn't  expect a trash hauling company: even a very big one catering only to  demolition, construction, and industry, to have something like this. But WIC is  unique.</p><p>Ned was on the couch lazily watching television. He had  spent the last week doing nothing but beefing up security. It wasn't hard to  convince his cousin Dave, head of the compound's, small but highly competent,  security force, to approve of the changes. Dave Albert (his mother was the  sister of Ned's father) was the type of person who'd wear a tinfoil hat, if it  wasn't for the dress code required of WIC security. As to why they even needed  an internal security force…</p><p>There was a knock on the door. Ned groaned as he got up. It  was probably Dave undoubtedly griping about how animals kept setting off new  perimeter net. <i>God Damn it,</i> he  thought while walking towards the door. "Yes it's my fault that he had to  send a team out just because a deer got a little too close to the cliff. He <i>could</i> just check out the alerts, using  the cameras, but no they might have been compromised. Paranoid loon."</p><p>Ned looked though  the fish eye, before opening the door. Granted, while the chances of someone  getting inside were low, the chances of getting in undetected were next to nil.  Ned had designed and built most of Rebecca's precious watchers. He was the  master of Golem-tech, and the compound was his domain. It couldn't hold off the  military, but anything else wouldn't stand a chance, for Security Chief Albert  had carefully chosen his men, all of them had the best templates WIC personnel  could code and more importantly were well trained, good men loyal to the family.</p><p>Like the rest of Winston Industrial Container, Albert had  no idea why they need such security, his team made sense as they were near  Lockridge, and headquarters needed some protection, but the rest? At least his  were the only teams that had templates. He didn't complain however, overkill  security was a good thing for him.</p><p>Seeing who was at the other side of the door, Ned opened  it without hesitation.</p><p>"About time you got the door son," the man at  the door said. Robert Winston was a portly fellow who could switch from good  old boy to ruthless business man instantly. Ned always thought his great uncle  bore a strong likeness to an older version of "News Radio's" Jimmy  James.</p><p>Ned looked to see Dave in his red and gray jumpsuit  standing next to the President of Winston Industrial Container. "Guess I  didn't hear your chopper come in."</p><p>Stepping inside, "Really? Well someone knew I was  coming. You wouldn't have anything to do with my chopper's approach being  challenged, would you?"</p><p>"Sir, the orders are to investigate every approach  on compound grounds." Security Chief Albert responded, still outside of  the apartment.</p><p>"I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to the  bonehead that decided it was a good idea to turn this place into a fortress. We're  <i>trying</i> to keep a low profile. Wouldn't  our visitors find it suspicious that a company in our field would have such  extravagant security?"</p><p>"But the secure net is concealed, most of the staff  doesn't even know its here, let alone the handful of visitors we get," Ned  said in his defense.</p><p>"What about the entry checkpoints you've undoubtedly  set up?"</p><p>"They're as unobtrusive as possible. Look, the point  of these new features isn't so much to keep anything out, but to give us an  early warning."</p><p>"About what?"</p><p>Ned simply looked at the open door.</p><p>"Dave please wait outside," Bob sighed.</p><p>"Sir?"</p><p>"Need to know." Bob said as he closed the door.</p><p>"This should prevent anyone form listening in,"  Ned said fiddling with what appeared to be a home security keypad.</p><p>"If you insist on the cone of silence," Robert  Winston said while thinking, <i>Oh boy, this  should be good.</i></p><p>Ned explained Rebecca's recent actions, and the  cancellation of the deal.</p><p>An experienced businessman, Bob managed to keep his face  neutral. He had known of the deal with that girl, and had approved of it. If his  company had started buying <i>those</i>  materials, it would look rather suspicious. But if this girl was upsetting the  balance in Lockridge that could cause his corporation problems. WIC needed to  be somewhat low profile before he made his move. Bob didn't really care about  mech's they were just icing on the cake, a way to get in the government's good  graces. No, the real money would come from all the little things Ned had to  have invented, just to make a mech work.</p><p>After the appropriate delay, Bob spoke. "I came here  today, to speak before the town fathers. Despite the fact that WIC is entirely  mundane, except for some of the staff and facilities here, they believe that  this company could be a danger to town security. I can not have you or any one  else involved in a feud. Especially if giant robots were to be involved."</p><p>"But Rebecca's unstable, she might attack."</p><p>"Then yes, you could defend yourself or the  compound, but please try to keep the situation contained."</p><p>Ned looked at the older man. He knew why they paid for  his workshop and the parts. "Right," then changing the subject, "So  how's business?"</p><p>"Good. There's a bridge demolition in St. Anthony  that we're covering."</p><p>"Ah so we got into Idaho," Ned said  contemplating the steel coming his way.</p><p>"There was also a rail crash up North in  Thermopolis, some pretty rude stuff."</p><p>Ned nodded WIC also leased container for hazardous  materials transport. Although with HAZMAT, WIC just shipped it, they didn't  dispose of it.</p><p>"And there's the standard construction and industry  work."</p><p>"Right, well it's good to see things are on track."</p><p>"Yes well, I must be leaving," opening the door  Bob looked back, "Remember be careful."</p><p>Ned watched him walk down the hall to the stairs with  Dave following him.</p><p>"What was that about?" Julie said form her  door, at the far end of the hall.</p><p>"Just visiting," was the succinct reply.</p><p>"You doing anything today?"</p><p>"Nah, taking the day off."</p><p>"But you skipped all week."</p><p>"I was doing other things."</p><p>"Fine. Anyway I was wondering if you were up for a  death match?"</p><p>"Mech Warrior custom version?"</p><p>"What else," she responded rhetorically.</p><p>"Why do you want to play that? Name one time I didn't  wipe the floor with you."</p><p>"You'll see"</p><p>Ranma was in the den, working at a laptop. He was  currently running notepad, MS Developer Studio, a Clash interpreter, some other  miscellaneous compilers. He also had some books, next to him entitled: <i>Cobol and You: Partners in Freedom, Someone's  in the Kitchen with C++, </i>and<i> Assembly:  The Wave of the Future</i>. Ranma rubbed his forehead, at the disturbed, almost  hallucinatory text. He had no idea where Sarah dug up these tomes.</p><p>It was his own damn fault. He did ask Sarah to teach him  how to program. Ranma didn't expect it to be so mind numbingly dull. Sighing he  looked over the code for his latest project. So far he'd worked in Java script,  Basic and FORTRAN, but this program was a replica of an old infiltrate and observe  program Sarah had written, in C for some reason.</p><p>Ranma readied his compiler, knowing that this time it  would work. He loaded the file, compiled it, and…</p><p>…got  the blue screen of death. Before he could read the warning, the screen flashed  red, black, and then a sickly green that slowly faded to black.</p><p>"In god's name why won't you work?" the  pigtailed boy said in an eerily calm voice.</p><p>The computer in front of him remained blank.</p><p>Maintaining his composure, Ranma calmly hit the restart  button.</p><p>The  notebook-shaped device remained inert.</p><p>"Damn your insolence! You <i>will</i> pay!" the martial artist and neophyte programmer  exclaimed. After closing and flipping over the object, Ranma punched its  underside lightly. After righting it, he hit the button again.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Ranma's eye twitched, his mind succumbing to what  programmers refer to as "code rage." A burning anger that develops  when a computer despite all logic, simply refused to cooperate. Normally it  happens when a program refuses to work, but it can extend to other aspects of  computing. Images danced in Ranma's mind of tossing the computer into a  chipper-shredder, dousing the plastic and metal shards in kerosene, and then  feeding the burnt and melted ashes to a pack of rabid wolverines. His hand  shaking, he pushed the button one more time.</p><p>He felt the minute resistance build up as he compressed  the spring behind the button. After it clicked softly, Ranma withdrew his  extended digit.</p><p>The box was unresponsive.</p><p>Ranma gripped the closed laptop on either side. Yes, all  he had to do was flex it just right, and snap- all his problems would be over.</p><p>"No that's not right," he thought looking at  the black plastic case. Then in that very quite voice "If I do that the  program wins.  And that's <i>exactly</i> what <i>they</i> want me to do" Ranma put the device down , opposite his  books, stood up, and walked into the kitchen.</p><p>"Hey Sarah? My comp locked up when I tried to  compile something, and now it won't restart," Ranma said entering the  room.</p><p>"Have you tried hitting it?" she asked, sitting  at the table.</p><p>"Several times."</p><p>"How about a good swift kick?" Sarah suggested.</p><p>"Might work," Ranma commented.</p><p>"Ran-Man has a box?" the semi-conscious thing,  across the table, mumbled.</p><p>"Yeah I gave him my old laptop."</p><p>"I see," Dan said, still slumped on the table.</p><p>Turning to her brother, "There's still the problem  as to why it crapped out in the first place."</p><p>"One of the those books warned something like this  might happen. I think it was the cookbook," Ranma proposed.</p><p>"Wait," Dan said, the lag in his brain  diminishing. "You're programming? Sarah are you sure that's a good idea."</p><p>The half-Irish  redhead ignored her cousin and thought for a moment. "What project were  you on when this happened?"</p><p>"That intercept and infiltrate one."</p><p>Dan raised his eyebrows at Sarah.</p><p>"But isn't that a bit ambitious?"</p><p>"The project just before it worked fine."</p><p>"The A Type encryption bypass?" Sarah asked</p><p>"Yeah, so?"</p><p>"My god you're not a L4M3R," Dan stated,  somehow managing to correctly pronounce the "word."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Come on Ranma. You're writing programs. Now granted  that's a ways from being L33T, but you've climbed up the ladder pretty quick."</p><p>"What the basic principles for programming are the  same with every language; the syntax is just different. Once you understand the  style of a language you can figure out how to get it to do what you want."</p><p>"Yeah that's about how it works," Sarah  admitted. "But how did you figure that out?"</p><p>"I am a martial artist," Ranma stated as if to answer  the question.</p><p>Sarah and Dan looked at each other in awkward silence.</p><p>Dan was the first to speak, "Let's see in order to  hack you must be able to improvise, plan your strategy, posses stealth, be  fully aware of your environment, have a vast library of programs and apps, and  the wisdom to know which to use and when." Dan paused. "I can see the  parallels, but I didn't think that those skills would be transferable."</p><p>"The ONE  thing Genma gave me was my training. The cost however was."</p><p>"Remember bro, if the panda bastard didn't do what  he did, I wouldn't exist." Sarah's face turned grim, "I will never  condone what he did, and I'm glad he's dead, but his actions had consequences  far beyond his knowledge."</p><p>"A butterfly flaps its wings and all that." Dan  said as he got up and walked toward the coffee machine. He filled his cup. "So  what? Did your training focus on adaptability?"</p><p>"Essentially. Anything could be interpreted as a  martial art."</p><p>"Martial Arts Coding?" Sarah said skeptically.</p><p>"No more ludicrous than martial arts tea ceremony or  any other number of insane esoteric schools out there."</p><p>"It's not that odd, remember the L33T Master?"  Dan pointed out.</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"A wise man of great S[1LLZ," Dan said,  again managing to verbalize the "L33T"</p><p>"It's just a comic," Sarah responded.</p><p>"Largo is real."</p><p>"No 'Largo'  is the pen name of the old writer for the comic, who just happens to be <i>based</i> on one of the main characters."</p><p>"So you agree  the L33t Master is real."</p><p>"That's not  what I said!"</p><p>Ranma watched the argument escalate. He shook his head  and walked back to the couch. Picking up his laptop he held it just above his  right foot. Releasing his grip, he dropkicked it. There was the resounding  crack of plastic breaking as the computer flew in a short arc. It hit the  backrest of the sofa near its apex and landed near the edge of the seat  cushion. Ranma then poked the machine.</p><p>It responded with a gentle chime and the wiring sound of  a hard drive spinning up.</p><p>Ranma smiled as the machine started up. <i>So, that's all I needed to do,</i> Ranma  thought, sitting down the machine in front of him. <i>Now why'd this thing die on m</i>e? he thought opening his source code.</p><p>Ranma  was working on what he thought was the problem, gently muttering to himself. "Yes  I think this protocol was corrupting my buffer or Bios or some-such thing. No  this loop needs to end at I equals J+N not when it's greater than. Damn, why  the hell is this function calling <i>that?</i>"  Ranma looked up hearing someone else walking in the room. "Allison don't,"  he said, addressing the invisible girl that was probably in the room.</p><p>"Damn you and your spider sense, Peter Parker,"  the disembodied voice replied.</p><p>"That's nice and all, but I'm trying to do work  here," Ranma said, his training allowing him to get a general idea of  where her voice was.</p><p>Ranma did not see the water coming. She then jumped up  off the couch, twisting around to face where the water had come from. "What'd  you do that for? Look you got the couch all wet, and you almost soaked my box,"  Ranma said looking at her computer. "Stay," she then said to the girl  that might be in the room.</p><p>Sarah was looking over at Dan, who was again sprawled out  on the table. She turned to see her sister enter the room. "I see Allison's  bored."</p><p>"Yup," Ranma said distastefully putting her  hand under the faucet.</p><p>"Eh don't worry about it, she got me too," Dan  said lifting his head up.</p><p>"Really," Ranma said, turning off the tap. "But  water doesn't affect you."</p><p>"Remember that little trick of hers, you know the  one that put you both in catholic school girl uniforms."</p><p>"I've gotta see this," Sarah said.</p><p>"Fine," Dan said getting up. "If you  really want to find out," he said before shifting.</p><p>"I see you're going for the punk look," Sarah  observed</p><p>Dan shrugged. Her hair had been pulled back, into a very short  pony tail, except for two sets of bangs that hung on either side of her face,  and were dyed a deep violet.. Her makeup was of the same color scheme and  complemented her now red eyes. Allison had put her in at tight top and short  skirt both back with gray accenting. Dan was also wearing platform boots and  fishnets. She was still wearing a black trench coat except this one was cut to  the smaller frame of her girl form.</p><p>"At least you can pull it off," Sarah commented  appraising the girl. Then pulling at the few tendrils of loose hair, "Well  she hasn't pieced your ears yet. Although, I wouldn't worry about it, after all  Erika's pierced. Ah, but Allison did do your nails," Sarah said holding up  Dan's hand.</p><p>Dan rolled her eyes, "Yes, laugh all you want."</p><p>"Come on <i>Dianna</i>,  I've had to deal with her pranks for months, and now the shoe's on the other  foot."</p><p>"So are you still going to keep the curse?"  Ranma said finally speaking up.</p><p>"Of course, why not?" the punk girl replied.</p><p>"But she put you in a skirt." Ranma said.</p><p>"So, I don't really care about what I'm wearing. In  fact I kind of like it."</p><p>Ranma simply shuddered.</p><p>"Whatever," Sarah said dismissively. She then  tuned to an empty spot behind her. "Allison don't get any smart ideas."</p><p>"How'd you know?"</p><p>Sarah mumbled something inaudible and most likely rather  rude.</p><p>"What're you jealous?" the disembodied voice  next to Sarah said. "You're boobs are still bigger than hers."</p><p>Dan looked down at her chest.</p><p>"I'm just a little shaken up at how well Dan's  adapting," Sarah said pointing to her cousin.</p><p>"What? Would you prefer if I freaked out?" Dan  asked.</p><p>Sarah sighed, "Ok let me put it this way. Ranma, how  long did it take you to get used to your curse?"</p><p>"You're kidding me, right?" Ranma responded  dryly.</p><p>"First of all  Ranma's curse was forced upon him, in addition to other circumstances that  exacerbated things considerably. Now in my case the curse was—"</p><p>Sarah cut her off. "Yes we all know what was done  with you."</p><p>After that statement the conversation died, and an  awkward pause fell upon the room.</p><p>"Um Allison," Dan said, breaking the silence. "Shouldn't  you stop being invisible. You know so you don't go insane."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Allison said, the quicksilver  covering her body dissipating, rendering her visible. "What the…"  she said looking out the window. "No couldn't be," she muttered,  silver liquid appearing on her skin.</p><p>"How's big red?" the gothic dressed girl asked.</p><p>Stopping the flow, Allison looked down at her Ouroboros  tattoo, it was entirely red except for the last two bars. "Oh crap."</p><p>"Yes we can't have YOU going into quicksilver  madness," Sarah commented.</p><p>"This' happened before?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Sarah nodded slightly.</p><p>"Just let me do my eyes," Allison pleaded.<br/>"What?"</p><p>"I thought I saw something, outside, something that  I can't see now."</p><p>"Like the cape wearing mech last week?"</p><p>"I only got a glimpse but it was definitely smaller."</p><p>"Fuck," Dan said to herself. "Allison  scope out what's going on, just get a quick glace."</p><p>Allison looked out the window into the back yard. Her  eyes turned silver and disappeared.</p><p>Ranma gazed into the empty sockets, disturbed.</p><p>"BFG Now!" the eyeless girl shouted.</p><p>In a dim flash Dan shifted into her male form, and then  into template (Since the template was designed for Dan's male body much like  Ranma's was designed for his girl side). In one motion he drew, racked, and  tossed a rather large firearm from his ubiquitous coat.</p><p>With equal fluidity Allison caught the weapon, aimed, and  fired. Out of the rectangular hole in the barrel appeared a deceitfully dim  beam, progressing much too fast for the human eye to discern.</p><p>The window appeared to shatter into a collection of  coarse fragments simultaneous with the explosion of <i>some</i>thing in the back yard.</p><p>"Go! Clear it!" Dan shouted, pulling out two  large handguns both with similar rectangular apertures at the ends.</p><p>Reluctantly Ranma shifted into template. She turned to  see Sarah in her power suit, motioning forward. The pseudo-magic girl nodded  and pointed at the window.</p><p>Ned sat in the cockpit of his mech, waiting for the  dropship to reach release attitude. His eyes shifted between the monitors. He  checked that his headset was secured properly.   That the mike was lined up, it was plugged in, and that the cord was tucked  up and out of the way.</p><p>He then adjusted his controls making sure he could reach  all the critical buttons easily. Ned saw the dropship's bay doors opening in  front of him. His mech tensed up and when it could clear the gate, jumped.</p><p>The ninety ton machine plummeted towards the earth like  the rock it was, until the jumpjets kicked in. The pillars of flame reduced the  descent so that the mech could land safely. Ned pulled up out of a kneeling  position flipping out his Gauss riffle.</p><p>"What the hell's she in this time," thought Ned  as he moved his heavily modified Highlander IIC forward. "More importantly  where are we?" he muttered scanning the surroundings.</p><p>"Oh God no," Ned muttered as he crested a  largish hill. Glittering below him was a large city of narrow spires.</p><p>"Tokyo 3," he said, sounding out the syllables.  A smirk grew on his face, "About time Julie came up with a challenging  scenario."</p><p>Rebecca saw her watcher explode. Part of her was  surprised that it'd taken that long of them to figure it out another part was  angered at the loss of data. She had other watchers in the area she could use.  Her pointer hovered over the icon. One click and…</p><p>Wait. No. What would that accomplish? What could that  accomplish? If they were dead then she'd have lost all the progress she'd made  with Subject One. And that was even if her watchers managed to do the job.</p><p>Rebecca inhaled, and raised her finger off the mouse  button. She had to maintain her cool, no matter now much the antics of the  Terson girl annoyed her. She hit the recall order pulling back her remaining  forces. These watchers seemed to be out of the oppositions sensor range.</p><p>She closed her notebook. Again the damage was contained  and within acceptable limits. It was about time to go talk to the Hibiki boy  again. What would she say today?</p><p>How  about that while she can't <i>remove</i> the  curse without further study, she might be able to <i>replace</i> it with one that was more convenient.</p><p>Ranma scanned the forest, her glasses only picking up  background static. "I'm reading blank."</p><p>"Same here," Sarah said, her visor extended, standing  opposite Ranma</p><p>"Yeah but Ranma's the one that can see the things,"  Dan said kneeling next to the burnt remains of the bot that was in the yard,  centered in a triangle formed by the redheads and the house.</p><p>"I could tell that there was something there, I just  couldn't lock onto it."</p><p>"I can see 'em too," Allison said, standing  next to Dan, still holding the BFG.</p><p>"Yes but you were down to one green click."</p><p>"Hey I got my counteragent."</p><p>"Better safe than sorry," Dan muttered. Lifting  up a piece of twisted, burnt, and barely recognizable metal, "Well at  least we know these new guns work."</p><p>"Bah, you just ripped off mine," Sarah said.</p><p>"Still."</p><p>Ranma had phased out the conversation, instead using her  compact to manipulate the sensor feed. Suddenly an ident-chevron appeared on  the overlay. It was faint flickering in and out of lock-on, but it was there.</p><p>Extending her wings she leapt up and forward trying to  keep the signal.</p><p>"Where's she going?" Allison asked.</p><p>"I <i>told</i>  you wee needed radios or some type of com. system." Sarah said, powering  her jumpjets.</p><p>"Don't get too far." Dan warned.</p><p>"I think I can outrun someone with wings,"  Sarah said before jetting off.</p><p>"Fuck, how the hell did I lose it," the  fuku-clad girl said landing in a clearing formed by a largish rock outcropping.  The after being tracked a couple miles the echo simply vanished. "Great it's  invisible and stealthy." She paused and looked around at the circle of  trees surrounding the jutting boulders. "Damn it's barren out here."  Ranma remarked. She turned to watch another echo approach, this time from the  direction of the house.</p><p>"It looks like Age of Empires finally got something  right," Sarah remarked landing on one of the large gray stones, "And  where'd you go off to?"</p><p>"I was tracking one of those bots."</p><p>"Should have told us."</p><p>"Wasn't time."</p><p>"I told him we needed communicators," Sarah  repeated.</p><p>"This is stupid," the angel girl remarked.</p><p>"Pardon?"</p><p>"Look all we've done is react to this hacker bitch.  Granted except for my damn template, and Dan's arm, we've been successful, but  we need to take the initiative!"</p><p>"Oh I agree," Sarah remarked scanning the  tree-line. "But we can't attack if we don't know who's doing this."</p><p>Ranma glanced at her sister, "Yeah but it's just so  damn frustrating. I mean even here I'm still not in control of my life."</p><p>"You're still better off than when you were in  Nerima."</p><p>Ranma looked down at the tight, bow infested, sekifu, the  little skirt, and heeled boots she was wearing. "God that's pathetic,"  she observed dryly.</p><p>"That which does not kill us-"</p><p>"-postpones the inevitable," Ranma completed jokingly.</p><p>"I <i>was</i>  going to say, makes us stranger. But yours has a certain charm."</p><p>"Fine  let's go back," Ranma said spreading her wings.</p><p>Switching to dual joysticks, Ned waited for his next  respawn. According to the mini-map this'll put him just outside the southern  suburbs of the city. His thumbs rested just on the firing buttons. The gamer  focused his eyes through the central monitor allowing the images displayed on  the other two to blend in.</p><p>Monitoring his reduced rate of descent, Ned waited until  he had locked onto his target. Then  he depressed  his triggers, firing particle plasma charge rounds into his target.</p><p>"Fuck!" Julie screamed as her Eva's umbilical  was cut. Spinning around she brought up her rifle, a weapon longer than Ned's  mech was tall. "I will not be defeated by something shorter than me!"  she screamed into her headset unleashing high-energy particulate death.</p><p>Ned didn't flinch at the approaching beam: instead he  calmly tapped a button next to his weapons selector cutting his main jumpjets,  while simultaneously pulling back on the right stick.</p><p>Julie's attention was divided by the depleting power  counter on her display and the black mech managing to drop below her beam. "You're  not supposed to dodge that!"</p><p>Ned ignored the ranting coming from his headset, and  leaned forward hitting the ground in a roll. Switching to SRM pods he started  to fire.</p><p>Julie lowered her  weapon in a "spray and pray" fashion and watched as the opposing mech  dodge, while racks of missiles shot out to the machine's arms. Julie's Eva was  pushed back by the repeating waves of super dense air colliding with the  shield-like AT field. Continuing to watch the dwindling second counter, the brown  haired girl tried to reacquire the smaller mech.</p><p>Glancing at her tactical field, she decided to plug in. She  ran her Eva the couple blocks to the next umbilical jack. While vaulting over a  building she turned to see a crouching black figure, one arm outstretched and  steadied by the other. A forearm-mounted pulse cannon was powered up.</p><p>With only reserve energy left, Julie's Eva was unable to  generate the protective field, his first shot broke her gun in half, the second  and third were aimed at the neck. She managed to evade the burnt of the blast,  but at the expense of a clean landing.</p><p>The forty meter tall red and yellow semi-organic machine  thumbed through a handful of buildings. Partially covered in twisted metal and  rubble the Eva managed to stop near the umbilical station.</p><p>With only a few seconds left, Julie hit the corresponding  hotkey, and managed to establish a connection. Now with a regular power supply  the Eva jumped up and pulled a set of handgun styled weapons out of a nearby  supply building.</p><p>Julie leveled the guns at the black mech, firing. Ned  responded by twisting down and leaping forward his own pulse cannons blazing. The  Evangelion responded by leaning back and trying to fire into the dodging mech.</p><p>The black mech landed in a roll, swiveled up launched  another volley of SRMs. Once again connected to an entire power grid the Eva completely  blocked the high explosives.</p><p>Ned glared at the approaching bio-machine. He waited for  the Eva to pause, reload and then Ned rushed. He went airborne to dodge the  incoming shoot, while simultaneously using the pulse cannons. His first set  took out the weapons Julie was carrying, the resulting shrapnel doing  superficial to moderate damage to the machine's arms.</p><p>Jumpjets alerted the mech's path just enough so that on  the downward arc, Ned was able to roll over and have a clear shoot at the  umbilical jack.</p><p>"No you don't,"  Julie said AT field flaring around her, as the black mech took its shot.</p><p>Ned fired with his left arm just in time to see it  collide harmlessly with the yellow and clear barrier. Calmly he aimed the  cannon on his right arm to a spot where the Eva's power cable rested on the  street.</p><p>"Damn you,"  Julie said as her AT field collapsed. She reached behind her back to pull out  the useless adapter, when a blast hit that exact spot. She heard the majority  of the immense power jack fall to the ground, but her sensors indicated that  the probe from the jack was still in. "You're going to fucking pay for  that!" she screamed into her headset.</p><p>"Chatty bitch  should get on IRC if she wants to talk," Ned muttered mostly to himself,  switching to his Gauss riffles.</p><p>Julie charged despite the energy balls being launched at  her from the black mech's railguns. With that damn shard of plug stuck in the  receptacle a new jack couldn't be inserted. Meaning that what was left on the  timer was all she had left. Pulling out a pair of progressive-knives, she  prepared to get in close.</p><p>Ned allowed a slight grin, changed to pulse canons and  concentrated his fire. Just before the Eva got within striking distance with  its trans-vibration blades, a section of its chest armor failed. In the proud  tradition of pointless game gore, an amazing amount of reddish fluid spurted  out of the broken armor, drenching the gutted buildings, and pouring into the  shattered streets.</p><p>As the spray died down Julie looked to see the smaller  mech covered in what passed for the Eva's blood, still firing, but now it was  within reach. Rushing high low with the blade from either side, she made her  move.</p><p>Reacting instantly, Ned fired his jumpjets and twisted to  avoid the blades while aiming for the broken section of armor with his pulse  cannon. Julie watched the smaller machine try to squirm away. And it almost  would have made it if not for one thing.</p><p>When Ned twisted  out from between the progressive knives, he'd extended his arm to get a clear  shot at the point where he'd burned through the Eva's armor. Ned gritted his  teeth as the blade easily cut through his arm at the elbow.</p><p>In and attempt to gain some space Ned cut his jumpjets.  While switching to the last rack of SRM missiles, he fired.</p><p>Julie was consumed with three thoughts: the imminently  depleted power reserves, the point blank shockwaves consuming her, and plunging  her knife into Dan's torso. On the ground Ned aimed his remaining pulse cannon  at the Eva's left eye. He grinned slightly as he depressed an as yet unused  button on his joystick.</p><p>Normally Mech's generate a lot of excess heat. This is  understandable when you have a walking fusion reactor. Having to shut down you're  mech in during battle to prevent it from overheating and exploding is an  experience any mech commander is familiar with. Naturally, Ned's mech has been  extensively modified and had a way to compensate.</p><p>One of the modifications was placement of a large power  cell that siphoned and stored most of the excess power, diminishing the need to  dump coolant or shut down the reactor. In reality such a system would be  difficult, at best, to install, but in the simulation it was quite doable. The  button he depressed opened flow to that power source, one that had been  steadily growing.</p><p>A pulsating beam of green death poured out of the pulse  cannon, into the Eva's eye and straight our the back of it head. Fighting  against the force-feedback in his controller, Ned started to drag the beam  across the Eva's head.</p><p>Julie's mind was empty save for the knives. Ignoring the  alarms and concentrating solely on the job, she lurched forward. There was no  time left.</p><p>Ned's face became strained. Despite losing its power  source, compromised armor in its chest, various other damages, and having a  horizontal slit cut into its forehead, the Eva continued on. Ned had his own  problems as well, out of missiles, missing an arm, his remaining pulse cannon  was being fried by the surge of power, and there was another giant robot trying  to gut him like a trout.</p><p>Julie jabbed in nicking the side of Ned's torso. The  black mech only slid to the side slightly trying to control the steadily  decaying pulse cannon. Leaning over the smaller machine Julie lifted her knife and  started to drive it into Ned's chest, slicing though layer after layer of armor  until she hit his core.</p><p>The battle stopped.</p><p>The pulse cannon flickered out. The timer ran down, to  zero. The back mech stopped squirming. The Eva froze.</p><p>Ned unclenched his hands, and pulled them from the  joysticks. His eyes flicked between the three screens. Inhaling deeply, he  pulled himself out of the zone.</p><p>Julie kept her hands at the keyboard and stared at her flat  screen. It was currently displaying aerial spin over the two mechs. In a  semi-transparent frame front of the scene, appeared the battle stats. The brown  haired girl bonked her head on the desk and groaned.</p><p>Getting up Ned glanced back at his computer. He shook is  head. Not bad. The fight could have been more interesting, but not bad.</p><p>Using a pair of servo manipulators, Dan started to peel  back the case on one of the watcher's legs. Each manipulator was a small  robotic arm with a slew of attachments: grasping claws, reciprocating blades,  circular saw blades, a Dremel attachment, an attachment for a small blowtorch,  or whatever else could be fitted with the device.</p><p>"That's the last of it," Ranma said standing  behind the burnout hacker.</p><p>Dan paused the manipulator's progress and turned around. Ranma  had wheeled in another pile of scrap parts from the blast site. "Still a  girl?" Dan asked.</p><p>Ranma looked down at herself and shrugged. "Haven't  really had the chance to change."</p><p>"Whatever." Dan mumbled as he helped the  redhead unload the burnt scrap into the pile in the center of the garage bay.</p><p>"Except for some odds and ends that Allison and  Sarah are scrounging this should be the last of it," Ranma said.</p><p>Maneuvering the manipulators, Dan started to pry open the  casing of the device. "What the…" Dan said.</p><p>"Find something?" Ranma asked, hoping to get a  lead, anything on the bitch that was toying with them.</p><p>"Perhaps," Dan said, pulling out an array of  circuit boards from the device. He then pulled a magnifying light over the  electronic guts of the device. "That's not right."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"See for yourself," Dan said sliding over.</p><p>"Okay," the redhead said stepping over to  workbench. She then looked into the magnifier.</p><p>"See anything?"</p><p>"No not really, just a bunch of boards and stuff."</p><p>"Come on you can see more than that," he  remarked slightly amused.</p><p>Using one of the manipulators Ranma moved one of the  boards around. Nothing but some chipsets, power supply, actuator control, what  the… She stopped the rotation and pulled the magnifier in to get a better  look.</p><p>"So you see it.   Good."</p><p>"There's no serial number That's odd." The  redhead ventured. She noticed that one was never stamped into it.</p><p>"Companies are supposed to put one on them. Do you  know what this means?"</p><p>"Black market, not that surprising. I mean whoever  doing this has been lobbing fuckin' mechs at us."</p><p>"Exactly you can't pick these things up at the  hardware store, and the some of the components and materials themselves are  more than a little bit exotic."</p><p>"Well this just gets better and better," Ranma  mused. "Well at least we've got something. Maybe we can figure out where  the boards were made or something."</p><p>"I don't know I mean Ned said that he hasn't found  anything from the blast site at school."</p><p>"Right," Ranma pondered. "Dan how well do  you know Ned?"</p><p>"I knew of him for a couple of years. Lockridge is a  small place after all." Dan said sliding back over to the manipulators. After  a barely perceptible pause he continued, "Never really got to know him all  that well. I dunno, he just hung with different crowd. We never really talked  much specially after the Langley incident."</p><p>Ranma nodded, she didn't know all the details but  supposedly the Langley girl was the last person Allison dated before Dan and  there was some... unpleasantness attached to it. "Do you think he's?"  Ranma ventured.</p><p>"No." Dan stated evenly. "Our hacker's a  girl. That much we know."</p><p>Ranma just looked at Dan, eyebrow raised.</p><p>"All right really bad example, but still."</p><p>"You know what amazes me? So many people have asserted  the gender of this person. You, Sarah, Allison, Gos, Erika, that Sean guy they  hang with, Ned -hell I think even Jack talked about her once. And not once did  any of you give basis for this! I'm not even questioning the validity of it  anymore. What is going on here?"</p><p>"Now that-" Dan began.</p><p>The red head sighed in resignation.</p><p>"-would be telling." He finished.</p><p>"If you give me a little salute and say 'Be seeing  you,' I <i>will</i> blast you."</p><p>Dan dropped his right hand to his side, breaking the ring  formed by touching the tip of his thumb to his index finger. He sighed, "Okay  Ned's just like Gos or hell even you. Our little hacker bitch appears to have  two really L33T skills. She can get into essentially any system, and then adapt  whatever she steals."</p><p>"So she can just piggyback off the works of others."</p><p>"Had to happen eventually," Dan said  despondently.</p><p>Julie sat in the lobby of the South building, near the  currently cold hearth. The room was similar to the entrance room of a resort or  hotel. She glanced back at the woman behind the registration desk and gave a  slight wave.</p><p>Sally Winston returned the gesture, and resumed her work  on the inventory budget at the cleverly concealed computer embedded in the  counter. It was a slow day with only two guests staying in the compound.</p><p>Julie turned back to her laptop. She was making notes on  the replay of the matches to see what areas needed improvement. Later she would  work on the environment data for the mod and the design to her Eva.</p><p>"You should rewrite the dependency codes for the AT  field," a familiar voice said from behind her.</p><p>Julie rolled her eyes, "Yes Ned, how am I supposed  to have it read my soul?"</p><p>Flopping  down in a chair opposite her, and at the other side of the fireplace, Ned spoke,  "You could use a little Calash and have a direct link, but look that's not  the point, the real problem is that damn reliance on external power."</p><p>"I  tried to keep it as close to canon as possible."<br/>"So you were wearing a  plug suit and in a LCL filled tube."</p><p>Julie  held her forehead, "No Ned, I mean have it be able to fight like it did in  the Anime."</p><p>"It was an interesting challenge. You almost beat  me."</p><p>"I was in an Eva you were in a Mech."</p><p>Ned leaned back smiling slightly.</p><p>"I should have mopped the floor with you."</p><p>"As long as you learned something."</p><p>Julie paused, trying to decide whether it was more  appropriate to sigh or to glare at Ned.</p><p>Ned turned to see WIC security chief Albert approach.</p><p>"Hey Dave," Julie said still indecisive as what  to do with Ned.</p><p>"Julie," he nodded, then turning to his other  cousin, "Ned, we've completed the sweep on your truck."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"It was clean."</p><p>"Really? Are you absolutely sure of this?"</p><p>"Yes, after the first sweep indicated negative. We  went deeper into it."</p><p>"Ah, that was the delay."</p><p>"Sir, you did emphasize the need to be absolutely  sure of this."</p><p>"I know, very good Dave. How's the new system doing?"</p><p>"Very good, the ident program is running well within  parameters."</p><p>"Good," said Ned .</p><p>"If you'll excuse me."</p><p>"Fine," Ned responded lazily.</p><p>Once the Security officer had left the room, Julie spoke  up, "It's not nice to humor Dave's delusions."</p><p>"Who said he was deluded," Ned replied bluntly.</p><p>"What are you up to?"</p><p>Ned allowed a slight smile.</p><p>"Oh god," Julie sighed.</p><p>Gos looked over the scans of the watcher parts. He then  closed the laptop, "Interesting but why'd you come here to tell me. You  could have send me the information without leaving the house. Why leave a place  when you know it hasn't been secured?"</p><p>"Exactly," Dan said, as if that answered the  question.</p><p>Gos paused trying to understand the inanity.</p><p>Erika which was sitting, or more accurately being  projected, next to Gos, turned to Ranma, "Is he always like this?"</p><p>Ranma turned to his half cousin who was at the moment  staring at his own hand. "Yeah. I think it's from dating Allison."</p><p>Erika considered this, "Yeah she did turn him into a  girl."</p><p>"Hey that was a mutual decision," Dan objected.</p><p>"Nope. I'm thinking she cursed you while you were  sleeping," Ranma suggested.</p><p>Dan shrugged at this</p><p>"Okay so why are you here? And this time please just  answer the question," Gos asked slightly annoyed.</p><p>"Well aside from having the girls-"</p><p>Erika  raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Fine", Dan said, "aside from having  Allison and Sarah get some lunch, and giving you guys a heads up, we left  because the house wasn't secure."</p><p>"Oh so why don't you secure it?"</p><p>Dan smiled slightly, "Tell me what kind of security  does Reno have set up?"</p><p>Gos looked at Erika then at the wall of the apartment he  was crashing in. "Well Forge is a bit paranoid so he's got a pretty good  amount of security set up."</p><p>Ranma looked around the room, it was furnished in late  bachelor dive, a Coors mirror on the wall, across from a neon Red Dog sign.  They were sitting in an old restaurant booth with giant wire spool serving as a  table. There was still a great deal of thick green wire wrapped around it that  seemed to connect into a conduit tapped down to the floor.</p><p>As Ranma's as eyes tracked this oddity, things started to  fall into place. An exposed wire here, an odd reflection in a mirror there, a  neon sign that was buzzing just a bit too strangely, and dozens of other things  that were in and of themselves meant nothing. It was like the original background  to Sarah's old –no his- laptop.</p><p>At first it appeared to be a meaningless field of static,  and the harder you looked at it the more random it became, but if your eyes  unfocused just right an image would form, one with more shape and depth that should  be allowed by a flat screen. It was something where seeing it first time was  the hardest but after that it became automatic.</p><p>It clicked in Ranma's brain. His relatively new knowledge  of electronics mixed with his honed skills of observation to from a map of the  security system Reno had installed. It was incomplete and only of this room but  Ranma could fill in some the gaps.</p><p>While  this was happening Erika shot a questioning glance at Dan, as if to say: Has he  been doing this a lot? She then pointed slightly at the laptop: And he's been  using one of these too?</p><p>Dan nodded slightly, then nodded again.</p><p>Erika then looked at Gos. Her facial expression marked by  surprise, skepticism, and disbelief.</p><p>Gos simply shrugged.   Ranma was adaptable if anything.</p><p>The nonverbal conversation and Ranma's security analysis  were interrupted by the opening of a bench that was built into the far wall. "So  that's what those two cameras were pointed at?" Ranma thought, looking at  the portal that now connected to the floor below.</p><p>"Any old drunk could live above a bar, but it takes  a special kind to have his own trapdoor," the chainmail-wearing hologram  said.</p><p>"Erika," Gos started, "Reno lives over  Wolfe's Head,  one of the only restaurants  in town, and so what if it has a bar?"</p><p>Ranma looked at the open bench and then at the cleverly  concealed cameras positioned above it, and asked "Where is Sean?"</p><p>"Sleeping," Gos replied and was met with a  glare from Erika. "What? He was up <i>working</i>  all night."</p><p>Erika's response was cut off by a knock at the apartment's  front door. Gos' eyes darted between the closed door and the open bench. "It's  okay." Sean shouted from inside his room, breaking the tension, "It's  just Sarah and Allison."</p><p>"I thought he was asleep?" Erika asked.</p><p>"As did I," Gos responded, while he got up to  the door.</p><p>"Eddy from the grill told us to come up here for our  orders." Sarah stated as Gos opened the door.</p><p>"Damn some<i>one</i>  been watching a little too much Drew Cary." Allison said after a quick  scan of the room, her gaze resting on the trapdoor bench.</p><p>"You think Sean fancies himself as the dumb one or  the weird one?" Sarah replied.</p><p>"Dumb. Weird," Erika and Gos said  simultaneously and respectively.</p><p>"Please tell me we don't act like that," Dan  asked of Allison.</p><p>"Trust me you two are worse," Sarah stated as  she walked to the open trapdoor. "Okay Eddy, We're up here can we have our  food now."</p><p>"Why'd you  think he wanted to send it up here?" Allison asked.</p><p>"They must have seen us go upstairs and assumed that  you'd be coming up with us." Dan said.</p><p>"Sounds about right." Sarah said, grabbing the  boxes that were being tossed up from the trapdoor.</p><p>"I still say that thing a dangerous indulgence,"  Erika stated.</p><p>"Hey, it's perfectly safe." Reno shouted, still  in his room. Then opening the door, he poked his head out. "That door's  monitored with full coverage by the sensor grid, and beside no one would launch  an attack <i>in</i> Lockridge, especially in  one of the only bars here."</p><p>"And why is that?" Dan asked evenly.</p><p>"That would incur the wrath of the town fathers.  They wouldn't stand for anything that would draw undo attention."</p><p>Dan leveled his gaze at Reno, "Obviously Gos has  failed to inform you to the specifics as to what is happening. A mech attacked school  grounds. The Sheriff's daughter's life was endangered several times. His house  has apparently been under surveillance for a long time. Don't you think a  powerful rogue mage warrants concern? After all didn't she hack your system as  well?"</p><p>"Only if her actions would compromise town security.  As I see it this conflict is entirely internal."</p><p>"Okay, who are these town fathers?" Ranma  asked.</p><p>"A bunch of Calash wizards that run the town  government. You know mayor, treasurer selectman, that sort of stuff."</p><p>"Ah," Ranma replied.</p><p>"Well, we should be going," Sarah said closing  the trapdoor and picking of the takeout boxes.</p><p>"You know Dan. You never did tell us why you left  the house after that bot incident," Gos said while Sarah and Allison made  their way to the door.</p><p>"You should have figured that one out." Dan  said as he stepped out of the apartment and started walking down the hall,  after the blonde and the redhead.</p><p>Ranma just shrugged as he left, pulling the door closed  behind him.</p><p>"Damn," Gos muttered.</p><p>"I cannot believe you," Erika stated.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"It's simple: Dan and the other left the house as  bait. They probably set up some sensors in the house to see just how far the  hacker has infiltrated."</p><p>"Makes sense."</p><p>"What I don't get is why Ranma's so calm about that  template of his. During the last couple days we've gotten more evidence point  to Ranma having organic tech. And still he's calm about it."</p><p>"First, I kinda downplayed the risks entailed by  organic tech. Saying that in survived that first fight he's essentially out of  the woods. And importantly Ranma's been at risk all his life. You know: 'a  martial artist's life is fraught with peril' and all that."</p><p>"Yeah but that whole thing with surviving the first  fight is just a theory of yours. We don't have enough information to tell what's  going to happen."</p><p>"My point exactly. We don't know so why give him  undue stress at our speculations."</p><p>"But you lied to him."</p><p>"No. I never did any such thing."</p><p>"Then you shaded the truth. Only told him select  things. Like what you said about that AI the <i>she</i> is carrying around inside of her."</p><p>"That was the complete truth that AI was never  designed to be conscious."</p><p>"Organic Tech," Erika simply stated.</p><p>"More speculation. But I see your point," Gos  allowed.</p><p>"At least Ranma approves of the Seattle operation."</p><p>"At least we have that." Gos agreed.</p><p>It was a total of twelve feet from the back door of Wolf's  Head to where the beast was parked. In the time for the four teens to walk to  the heavily modified truck, the slight overcast to the sky darkened and the  rainfall began.</p><p>"Oh shit" Ranma said after her curse triggered  (or reverted back to default if one were to be technical about it). She was  dressed in just a tee-shirt and boxers.</p><p>"Looks like somebody forgot to get dressed in their  girl form," Allison remarked.</p><p>Ranma shook her head.</p><p>"You want us to go back in I'm sure they've got some  hot water?" Dan said while unlocking his truck.</p><p>Ranma glanced at Sarah and Allison loading the boxes in  the now unlocked vehicle. "Nah. I'll just change when we get home."</p><p>"You sure?" Dan inquired already in the driver's  seat.</p><p>"Yeah, it's no big deal," Ranma said climbing  into the back seat.</p><p>"Okay," Dan said as he ran the ignition  sequence, and put the truck in gear.</p><p>Allison, riding shotgun, exchanged glances with Sarah,  who spoke up. "You're rather wet and wearing next to nothing. How is this  not a big deal? Hell we could easily gotten some hot water."</p><p>"It's just you guys and my guy clothes got pretty  wet before I changed, so I'd just change back anyway." Ranma said flicking  the water off her forehead.</p><p>Allison caught the glint of silver on the underdressed  redhead's finger. "When'd you get that ring?"</p><p>"What ring?" Ranma said before her arm was  grabbed by Sarah.</p><p>"Oh my god," Sarah muttered examining the ring.  Set in the silver band was polished white bone, and scrimshawed on it a was a  single rose. The stem and thorns were inked in a dark, almost black, green, and  inked in blood red were the petals themselves. Possessing amazing detail and  craftsmanship, it was hard to believe that the ring was a magical construct let  alone one that could very well be the product of organic tech.</p><p>"Where  the hell did that come from?" Ranma stated with genuine surprise.</p><p>"Your template," Sarah said simply.</p><p>"But I'm not in that damned thing."</p><p>"Leakage? Poor activation control?" Dan  suggested as he pulled onto main street.</p><p>"I don't think so," Sarah said. "Sis,  exactly how did you get that compact and glasses?"</p><p>"Well I was kinda thinking that it would be helpful  to be able to see that mech and then that a hands-free display would really be  useful," Ranma said, letting the whole "sis" thing slide.</p><p>"And now you're in a situation where you'd need  clothing…" Allison trailed off.</p><p>"Yeah but there's some problems with that," Dan  said. "Before new devices were created when you were <i>in</i> template, and now what? Is your temp reassigning accessories  while it isn't even active?"</p><p>"Not necessarily," Sarah said. "Remember  that ring appeared after the glasses and the compact."</p><p>"When I was passed out."</p><p>"So these extra accessories are what? Expansion  slots?"</p><p>"Why not," Sarah said. "So sis, you  willing to try it out?"</p><p>Ranma looked at the ring. "You know what this damn thing  could do to me?"</p><p>"Hey, it can't be worse than your temp" Sarah  said.</p><p>"And if it is you can always go into it,"  Allison helpfully suggested.</p><p>"At least I  have options," Ranma deadpanned before activating the ring.</p><p>"Well that fits with the theme you've got going,"  Dan remarked at Ranma's new clothing.</p><p>A flash of red light (similar to Ranma's activation  sequence, but more muted) had replaced her underclothes. Ranma was now wearing  a pair of white low healed sandals with rose clasps , a rose print skirt, a smallish  white top with rose accents, and a pair of rose clips pulled her hair back into  two ponytails. She was also outfitted with the expected makeup and jewelry  including that little silver ring.</p><p>"It's not any worse than Allison's fashion sense,"  Sarah remarked.</p><p>"Hey!" the blonde said. "Come on Dan do I  have no fashion sense?" she said pointing at her own body.</p><p>"You must keep in mind you are talking to your  boyfriend." Dan said.</p><p>"No I'm talking to my girlfriend." Allison said  coolly.</p><p>"Ah" Dan said, then noticing the expression on  the blonde's face shifted. "Um yes, yes you do," Dan stated while adjusting  her legs slightly, so as to control the pedals better.</p><p>"You two know, you don't have the making of a  healthy relationship right?"</p><p>"Come on Sarah, they've got about the most stable  one I've ever seen," Ranma said.</p><p>Sarah raised her eyebrow.</p><p>"Right bad example." The ponytailed redhead  looked at the ring then at her skirt. "I wonder if I can get something  better, or at least control it more," she said activating the ring again.</p><p>Seeing another red flash Dan looked in her rearview  mirror, "Heh, you were better off with that last one," she remarked  before noticing the heavy machinery around the school. "Hey isn't that  Ned?" she said pointing to the figure standing off to the side, and next  to a red pickup, under a black umbrella.</p><p>"I think it is," Allison said as they were  about to drive past the school.</p><p>Ned stood alone in the rain watching as the work crew dismantled  the remains of the guymelef. Upon arrival, the first thing the WIC team did was  record the location of every shard of metal, working with the precision of  forensic scientists. The material was then sorted. The pieces that showed some  promise of functionality were separated from the mere scarp. Everything was  then prepared for loading into the heavy haulers stationed at the perimeter of  the site. A full security detail had closed of the area, much to the irritation  of Judy Miller and to the amusement of the remainder of the faculty.</p><p>Winston could not help but smile. The hardest part of  this operation was not diverting a salvage group here, nor was it providing  foremen trained in the necessary procedures, or even the weather which refused  to cooperate. No the difficulty came in persuading Dave to send a detachment to  the site.</p><p>Ned was well aware as to why he had such ease in putting  together this project. It was a part of where Robert Winston was planning to  take his company; his vision for the future. That sat just fin with Ned.</p><p>The mage, machinist, and mech pilot smiled. Things  promised to be so interesting for the next few years. Too many years had been  spent in hiding. So much potential was wasted. The town fathers were blind to  the true power of Calash. What could be done. What should be done. What will be  done. Ned's smile stiffened into a little grin.</p><p>The ringing of his cell phone, broke his observation. After  glancing at the Caller ID display he flipped the device open. "Yes  Rebecca."</p><p>"Your ingenuity never ceased to amaze me," the  girl's voice said in a deceptively pleasant manner.</p><p>"As with your encryption algorithms, your signal  bouncing protocols are rather robust but rather distinctive as well. What is it  you want?"</p><p>"Enjoying your gift?"</p><p>"Which one?"</p><p>That got her attention.</p><p>Noticing the silence Ned continued, "Perhaps  reciprocity is in order then?"</p><p>"Perhaps some has already occurred," she stated  while thinking, <i>No he can't be working  with the pale boy. Can he?</i></p><p>"That is a possibility."</p><p>Rebecca looked at her tactical display. "Are you fully  aware of what that entails?" she said zooming in on him via a watcher.  Pressing a key made a targeting crosshair appear over his chest.</p><p>Ned calmly turned to face the watcher, "You should  be mindful of matters of magnitude. Do you really want to escalate?"</p><p>Rebecca was more impressed than angered. Ned had managed  to detect a cloaked watcher three hundred yards out, at the tree-line, without  any obvious augmentation. "Perhaps I was rash."</p><p>Ned paused at this. Rebecca showing willful restraint. "Explain."  he said into the phone.</p><p>"You are a student of history are you not."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"I propose a deal."</p><p>"I just opted out of our last agreement."</p><p>"This is more of a nonaggression pact."</p><p>"I see. What are the details do you propose?"</p><p>"We shall each have sovereignty over our own  possessions and territory."</p><p>"I see and contestable acquisitions?"</p><p>"I believe that our past dealings proves that we can  negotiate amicably."</p><p>"Yes. Any concessions needed to reach this deal?"</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>"I must say this new proposal of yours is  interesting. Although the reasons necessitating such an agreement are beyond  me."</p><p>"You've got company," Rebecca said in response.</p><p>Ned turned to see a familiar black truck turn into the  school's front lot. "Well then, we shall conclude this after I talk with  them."</p><p>Rebecca hung up at this.</p><p>Ned closed his phone and looked at it with interest. What  was the deal with that history comment. Rebecca knew full well what periods of  history he was interested in: World War Two and the Cold War. Why would she  mention that? The only deals during that war that fit were the nonaggression  pact signed by Hitler and Stalin. Or perhaps the treaty Chamberlain had with  Hitler where he bought a few months of peace by giving the fascists  Czechoslovakia.</p><p>No Rebecca would never place herself as the loser of that  war no matter how appropriate it was. Was she alluding to the Alliance formed  by Russia and what would later be the NATO powers. But Soviets failed as well.</p><p>"What is her game?" Ned asked himself as the  black truck pulled up.</p><p>"So why'd we stop here," Allison asked, as the  beast parked near the red pickup.</p><p>"Ned may have information we could use," Dan  replied.</p><p>"Um Dan? Ned doesn't know about the curses,"  Sarah suggested.</p><p>"Ah yes," Dan said thankful for the tinted  glass, that from the outside, would obscure her shape. "Is that better?"  he said after shifting.</p><p>"Yeah fine."</p><p>"Okay," Dan said lowering his window. "Hey  Ned I've got something for you."</p><p>"Yes?" Winston said walking up to the still  idling truck. The rain pounding on his black umbrella.</p><p>"We had a little incident today," Dan said  followed by a brief synopsis what happened with the watcher.</p><p>"Do you have any of the wreckage with you?"</p><p>"Sorry, just this," Dan said passing a disk with  the photos he'd taken.</p><p>"I'll look at it," Ned said as he pocketed the  zip.</p><p>"Seemed to have a similar cloaking field as that  mech," Dan said noticing the little WIC engraved in the handle of Ned's  umbrella.</p><p>"Really," Ned said looking into the truck. There  was Allison in the front, behind Dan was Sarah, and diagonally was that other  redhead, Sarah's sister. The girl with that angel template. The one who's  arrival coincided with when Rebecca started to become... erratic.</p><p>The girl seemed to be a little too formally attired, in a  pink dress with rose trim and lace, heels and stockings, a fair amount of  jewelry each containing at least one rose, and save for a few locks of hair  coming down from over her temples, framing an amazing face, her hair was pulled  up into a tight bun.</p><p>Ned almost froze at the gaze the girl leveled at him. Her  eyes, a compellingly deep shade of blue, locked onto him, calculating,  estimating, tracking. It only lasted for a faction of a second but Ned could  almost fell the power that the redhead commanded. It was a gaze that was deeply  familiar to him, but Ned was unable to locate where he had seen it.</p><p>"My  god and she isn't even in template yet," Ned thought his awe, mixed with  more than a little fear, was then replaced with clinical and professional interest.  "What's your plan now? I mean your current residence has been compromised,"  he said turning to Dan, but still tracking the girl in the corner of his eye,  noting that she was doing the same.</p><p>"Isn't that always the case?" Dan responded.</p><p>"Very true," Ned said, looking at the salvage  crew. Good, they are about halfway done.</p><p>"And as for our plan. Well we'll do a full sweep to  see how much has been compromised."</p><p>"But what about a sensor net? Security systems?"</p><p>"We'll have to do a complete rebuild."</p><p>'That'll take time," Ned mused, considering the  situation. Rebecca was obviously concerned about his girl. Why else would she  deviate from her usual stable, if amoral, plans? Unless Rebecca was not  panicking at all and this is still all a part of her plans. "Either way,  the situation will reach critical mass very soon." Ned thought looking at  the girl. It was then that he figured out where he had seen those eyes before.</p><p>They were bombardier's eyes. It was the same precise,  controlled, almost godlike, yet understandably reserved and subdued look of those  about to release their ordnance. The same eyes looking at him now could easily  have been looking down a Norton bomb site over Berlin, Dresden, Tokyo, Kobe, or  any other city about to be reduced to rubble. The same eyes as those buried in  anonymous bunkers dotting America's vast empty reaches, watching tactical monitors  waiting for that one call, to begin Armageddon.</p><p>People that when required of them, could unleash horrific  power.</p><p>Ned opened his mouth, knowing full well the path he had  to take, despite the risks involved. "I've been working on developing  countermeasures to this cloaking system," he said pointing to the guymelef  wreckage. "I'll have to look at the data you've given me but it should be  easy to incorporate it to detect these probes that have been wandering around."</p><p>"And what are you offering?" Dan asked.</p><p>"Basic exchange. You've given me the schematics and  pics of another of our little hacker's minions, The least I can do is give you  designs on how to build and effective sensor net."</p><p>"That's it?"</p><p>"Well let's see, you did help me net that mech over  there."</p><p>"But it was attacking us, you're the one who warned  us about it and came to help."</p><p>"Well I can't send you the sensor plans. Experience  has shown that all of our message traffic can be intercepted."</p><p>Dan nodded.</p><p>"So I will have to drive back home, and bring the  sensor plans back to your place."</p><p>"What about the modifications?"</p><p>"Those remains are still there, I can do the upgrades  during installation."</p><p>"Tell you what Ned, just give us the modified  schematics and we'll call it even."</p><p>Ned looked at the black truck. Despite the heavy rain and  that the engine was only idling he could fell the turbines. "Sure, I think  you guys can handle it."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>"Be seeing you," Ned said, before walking back  to his pickup.</p><p>"And you," Dan replied raising his window, and  putting the beast into gear.</p><p>Once inside the cab, Ned closed the door and watched the  black truck race into the distance. When it was out of sight he pulled two  objects out of his pocket. One was the disk Dan had given him, the other was  the cell phone that Rebecca had called him on.</p><p>He considered them both. Sighing he pocketed the disk and  opened the phone. Ned would give them the plans, but first he had a call to  make and a deal to negotiate.</p><p>"You think he'll play ball?" Dan asked as they  drove home.</p><p>"He's hiding something," Ranma said.</p><p>"He definitely knows more than he lets on,"  Sarah agreed.</p><p>"Remember, this is Lockridge. That's par for here,"  Allison added.</p><p>"True, but he was examining Ranma pretty intently. Think  he knows?"</p><p>"What?" Ranma curiously.</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>Ranma just shook her head.</p><p>"What do you think Ned's part is in all this?"  Allison asked.</p><p>"We know he isn't our little hacker, but aside from  that…" Dan muttered.</p><p>"So what is WIC?" Ranma asked. She'd seen the  logo, consisting of italic double-lined letters, on Ned's stuff and that work  crew.</p><p>"Winston Industrial Container." Dan said before  going into a brief summary of the organization.</p><p>"I didn't know Ned had enough sway to divert a work  crew like that, or does he have his own subordinates?" Sarah said.</p><p>"Why  do you think I suggested that we should make that deal with him," Dan said  as he drove. "Even if he's not our enemy he's got enough influence to  alter the whole situation."</p><p>Rebecca closed her cell phone. A small grin formed on her  face as she looked out onto the valley that rolled out below her. She then  walked from the porch railing to the door that lead into the kitchen.</p><p>"Who  was that?" Ryoga asked, sitting at the kitchen table, in front of him were  two compasses one magnetic, one gyroscopic, two cups of water, and an I/O  sphere hooked up to a palm-pilot.</p><p>"I  just convinced a powerful wizard to not give Ranma sanctuary."</p><p>"Oh, I see."</p><p>"Let me see how you're doing," Rebecca said  picking up the palm, and looking a the reams of painstakingly gathered,  important looking, and ultimately useless data. The girl nodded at the display,  "I think you're about ready for a field test."</p><p>Ryoga nodded at this.</p><p>"So what do you think," Sarah asked as she got  ready for bed.</p><p>"It seems to work," Ranma replied.</p><p>"Took long enough to put in."</p><p>"At least that that Winston guy wasn't here to long."</p><p>"You don't like him very much."</p><p>Ranma paused, then spoke, "Yeah. There's something  off with him. He has this strange distance. It's as if everything was a game to  him. Remember during that mech fight. Kinda like he thinks that he can hit  restart, if he screws up."</p><p>"To him it may very well still be a game."</p><p>"And in the car when he was appraising us?"</p><p>"What are you saying?"</p><p>"Look he might not be the one who imprinted me, but  who knows what he's up to."</p><p>Sarah turned from her dresser to look at her sibling, "It  obvious that he's plotting something. But it's got more to do with his little  company than with us."</p><p>"Then why did he help is build that sensor net?"</p><p>"Remember what dad said when he got home,"</p><p>Ranma nodded, "Yeah he was in a meeting with the  mayor, a local business man, and a few others, talking about town security."</p><p>"You don't think that was about WIC?"</p><p>"Maybe."</p><p>"We know that Ned's been compromised by the same  hacker that's be plaguing us."</p><p>"Unless Ned sold her those designs."</p><p>"I don't think Ned would work with someone like  that. He wants WIC to keep a low profile. Associating with our hacker bitch  would surely bring the town fathers down on him."</p><p>"So the enemy of my enemy is my friend?"</p><p>"In this case? Yes."</p><p>"Still."</p><p>"Look it's late. We're both tired from lashing those  damn sensor pods to god knows how many trees. Lets just drop this subject till  tomorrow," Sarah said fatigue edging her voice.</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>"Your ring's gone," Sarah pointed out.</p><p>"Yeah happened, just after I changed," Ranma  said looking at his hand.</p><p>"At least that's something."</p><p>"Yeah. No you're sure you don't mind me sleeping as  a guy? It's just that I've been a girl almost all day and I was only able to  change back a few minutes ago. What with it still raining when we were setting  up the sensors and all, and then when-"</p><p>"Again I don't mind," Sarah said cutting him  off. "It was your idea to sleep as a girl in the first place."</p><p>"Sorry."</p><p>"No need," Sarah said, climbing into her bed,  where she started to drift off almost instantly.</p><p>Ranma shrugged, then turned off the lights and climbed  into the top bunk. It took a couple minutes for him to nod off.</p><p>Once asleep the martial artist shifted into girl form,  followed by a slight reddish glow emanating from the now female body.</p><p>"Oh no," Gos said.</p><p>"What?" Erika asked, turning away from the TV.</p><p>The hologram simply waved his hand at the laptop screen. Erika  started reading the message, still amused by the novelty of being on this side  of the monitor. Her whimsy ended when she got to the body of the message. After  pausing to digest the information, she made a series of comments similar yet  more vivid and in depth than the one Gos made.</p><p>"Did you send your reply?" she asked after  regaining her composure.</p><p>"Not yet, I just got the message. Looks like we're  going to have to bring Ranma in for some recordings."</p><p>"Are you sure of this."</p><p>"We have to convince them that they're on the right  trail, and I will NOT let those lunatics get within the same state as Ranma."</p><p>"And if they discover our subterfuge?"</p><p>"That's why we have contingency plans. I just hope  we'll never have to resort to them."</p><p>"Well then, let's get to work," Erika said  sliding the computer over to herself.</p><p>[End Chapter 6]</p><p>Thanks to my Pre-readers</p><p>Wrayloflin, Jerry, Jakub, The  Jak, and Black Dragon</p>
