</div><p>Generation Lost</p><p>Josh Temple</p><p>To clear up some of the  confusion Ranma's not mine, neither are the various cameos, template ideas, or  character references. However the concept for Calash, templates, imprinting and  such is mine.</p><p>Website:   9 New Growth</p><p>"These orders have  forced us to declare independence."</p><p>Babylon 5, Season 5 Intro.</p><p>Ranma was clearing out her garden. The  redhead smiled at that, <i>her</i> garden.  It was originally her mother's, but after more than two years of no one tending  it, it had become overgrown.</p><p>The redhead stopped her work; the white glow around her hands vanishing. A few  yards down the slope, there was something obscured by a couple of trees that  caught her eye. It was a large bush that had thick gnarled branches. Only the shape of the leaves betrayed what it  really was.</p><p>A  smile formed on her face as she bounded over to the bush. "Wow...  you're  a lovely old thing," she said as she ran her hands over the plant,  taking care to avoid the thorns, some of them several inches in length.</p><p>"I guess the trees helped protect you," Ranma thought as she looked  at the saplings. "Still, you're  not doing so well. Don't even have the energy to bloom." Ranma frowned as she knelt down to examine  the plant further. "Great roots and  branches though."</p><p>"I can't let one of Mom's roses live like this," Ranma said as she  shifted into her princess mode. Careful not to let her long dress get caught on  anything she stood back up and stepped back. She smiled sensing, the life-force  of the plant. The rosebush was very strong, very hardy. It would be  perfect. The princess summoned her wand  and pointed it at the bush, enveloping it with a bright green light.</p><p>Ranma smiled as she watched new leaves start to bud on the bush. More importantly she could feel a connection  to the plant. "Don't worry," she giggled to the bush. "I'll let  you get used to your changes. I'm not gonna force you to bloom."</p><p>"I should have known you'd be talking to plants, but isn't this dress a  bit much? I mean, don't you have clothing specifically for gardening?" Dan  asked as he walked up to the girl.</p><p>"Sure, I could have just pulled my wand out. It's not that complicated of  a spell," Ranma said as she shifted back into a tank top and shorts.  "But, it's a special occasion. One  my Mom's plants that survived is a rosebush!"</p><p>"This big thing?" Dan said as he looked over the plant. "It's a mess of thorns and branches."</p><p>"Roses have thorns, you know,"  Ranma sighed as she went to work on clearing around the bush. She decided to leave the trees in place. They  would make good wind breaks. "So, what are you doing here? I'm pretty sure you guys aren't interested in  gardening."</p><p>"I was walking back from the range and saw a girl wearing a green gown  blasting a plant with a wand. That made me a bit curious."</p><p>"Oh I see," Ranma nodded. She looked up from magically improving the  soil to study the bush again. "You have no idea how great this is,  Dan!"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"I was worried that I'd have to grow some bushes from seeds or maybe from  a garden center. But now I've got good stock to grow my plants from! Look at  how well it's responding to my magic."</p><p>Dan could see the plant was greening up and was looking more alive. "This  thing? A wild rosebush that you've found in the woods?"</p><p>"Well yeah... Wild Rose school.  Besides, I don't mean to be rude Dan, but what if you found something of  your mother's?"</p><p>Dan frowned. "Yah... guess that would be something. It <i>is</i> an impressive plant. Got nice big thorns  on it."</p><p>"Yeah, roses really are great.  They're very hardy plants, very deep roots."</p><p>Dan sighed. Ranma was babbling about  roses again. "As mind-numbingly fascinating as that is... I'm gonna make  lunch."</p><p>"Lunch?" Ranma looked at her  mother's rosebush. "I'll be right in. I'm gonna try putting some  protective spells in this thing, and link it to me."</p><p>"Um... okay," Dan said before walking back to the house.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I heard you found one of mother's rosebushes," Sarah asked her  sister. Both girls were in the room they shared.<p>"Yup! It's a great plant,"  Ranma said as she sorted through her dresser drawers. "Say, did you know  if Mom liked roses?"</p><p>"I think she liked them fine," Sarah shrugged. "What are you  doing?"</p><p>"I'm converting my clothes." Ranma then pointed at the boxers in the  drawer and with a white light they shifted into rose themed bras and panties.</p><p>"I thought you weren't sure what you were going to do?"</p><p>"Running out of acceptable underwear forced me to make a choice."  Ranma sighed. "Magic clothes are great and all that, but they're not so  good for use as undergarments for a prolonged period."</p><p>"Oh... strange."</p><p>"Yeah, it took me a bit of time to figure it out. My 'magic clothes' are  really me shifting the clothing I'm already wearing."</p><p>"And they don't get cleaned each time you change?"</p><p>"Technically they do, but it doesn't feel as clean as new clothes,"  Ranma shrugged.</p><p>"That explains why you take your blouse and skirt off every night before  going to bed."</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"So it's only a matter of time before all your clothing is converted  anyway?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"I suppose I could just wear a couple outfits and keep the rest as some  memorial to before my transformation, but then I'd have to do laundry a lot  more. This way's much better," Ranma said as she started looking at what was  in her next drawer.</p><p>"So... anymore thoughts on that prince stuff?"</p><p>"Huh? Ranma said, dropping the  black tights she had just made from a pair of pants. "Oh... that...  I don't really know. I'm not  feeling any different."</p><p>"Not even when you were teasing Ned?"</p><p>"Nope." Ranma shrugged as she picked up the tights. She then changed a red tang into a female cut  and added some rose embroidery and gold etching. It ended up kind of fancy, but  she liked fancy now.</p><p>"I guess you're just waiting for your specific prince. In most of the  fairy tales the princess does only have eyes for him."</p><p>"That's a fun thought," Ranma deadpanned as she resumed converting  her clothing. She was at her closet now  and was going for blouses, dresses, and skirts.</p><p>"As long as you're not feeling any strange urges..."</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"About princes."</p><p>"If what you said is true, I'll know it if I meet him," Ranma  frowned.</p><p>"You okay? This might not even  happen, and you seem okay with being a girl."</p><p>"A girl yes, but liking some guy is  something else."</p><p>"Maybe it's a prince from your past?"</p><p>"That's making it worse!"</p><p>"Okay, maybe he became a prince. You became a princess."</p><p>"Still, there weren't any good guys from Nerima. Even if I was into boys,  I'd never be interested in any of them!" Ranma sighed. She blinked.  "I became a princess."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"That could work. If I find myself  looking for a prince... that's what I'll do!"</p><p>"Care to fill me in?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"I've been looking at this the wrong way. This prince thing just means that if I find  the right person. Someone I fall in love with, THAT will be my prince!"</p><p>"Oh, that's better for you?"</p><p>"Sure it is. I'm not attracted to guys. So a female prince is likely," Ranma smiled as she resumed transforming her  shoes.</p><p>"That's a lot of high-heeled sandals," Sarah noted.</p><p>"I like 'em," Ranma shrugged. "Besides  I have a pair of sneakers and a pair of boots."</p><p>"Still..." Sarah shook her head. "Back to the topic. You're not  worried that the person you fall in love with will be male?</p><p>"Not really. If I fall for a guy, then he has got to be worth it. I'm Princess  Rose. Whoever I fall for is gonna have to meet my standards."</p><p>"With an ego like that..." Sarah laughed. "Still, Prince is  kinda gender specific."</p><p>"Yeah, but there's a couple female princes in magical girl things. I mean  there's that show... Utena. It has a rose princess  and she ends up with a girl in the end."</p><p>"And in Sailor Moon there are two lesbian Senshi?"</p><p>"Yup."</p><p>"Of course in that show, the princess ends up with a total loser of a  prince."</p><p>Ranma frowned. "Yeah, horrible waste of perfectly good roses. Whoever,  whatever my prince is, I'm not gonna let her pull that kind of nonsense."</p><p>"Provided you find Mr. Right," Sarah suggested.</p><p>"I'm not in any hurry, and I'm sure it will be a Miss Right."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma smiled as she cut a clipping from her mother's rosebush using a thin line  of red light from her finger. "I know you don't like being cut, but you're  healthy now and you're all alone out here." The plant had exceeded her expectations. It  had even started to form flower buds. It was still a large, unruly monster of a  bush, but it was very healthy looking and seemed to pulse with vitality.<p>The redhead walked over to a garden she was making just down slope from the  mother bush and planted the clipping.  She summoned her wand and with a burst of green energy it had sprouted  roots and was well on its way.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Ranma could feel the weak connection the young plant had with  the main bush and herself.  "Good. You're growing great." Ranma then repeated the pattern and planted a  few more new bushes.</p><p>She then felt someone entering her garden. "Sis!" the redhead said as  the turned to hug her blue-haired sister.</p><p>Erika smiled and returned the hug. "Impressive use of life energy and  plant-based computing," she said, studying the roses. With her sister's  help she had constructed her own internal I/O sphere.</p><p>"The computer side's just a pleasant side effect," Ranma dismissed.  "It's useful in knowing how they're doing though."</p><p>"I think there's more use to this than just that. If your plants can tell you if they need  water or sunlight..."</p><p>"Oh my," Ranma smiled. "I'll tell Dan that I can help with his  little sensor net."</p><p>"Can you make plants with sensors in them?"</p><p>"I've got some roses. Let's see if we can," Ranma said as she  summoned her laptop.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Impressive range on your projector," Dan said, while he sliced an  apple.<p>"The projector's inside me, but yes it does have to transmit to our  body," Gos agreed as he stood at the other side of the kitchen table.</p><p>"Well, I'm worried," Dan suddenly said after eating an apple slice.</p><p>"About what? There's a lot to be worried about."</p><p>"This time it's our two computer-girls. Whenever they get together..."</p><p>"They do make good stuff," Gos pointed.</p><p>"They're getting bolder. I just wonder what they'll make next," Dan  shrugged.</p><p>"Wait... you love this tech stuff." Gos narrowed his eyes. "I  see. You just want them to help you with your template."</p><p>"You got me. Look at what Ran-man's been helping Sarah with. We should be  good to go."</p><p>"Yes, the hacker-bitch does like  her robots and mechs." Gos nodded.</p><p>"There you are, honey!"  Allison said as she walked into the kitchen. "I thought you were  going to drive me to the grocery store."</p><p>"I... forgot," Dan explained.  "We can go now..."</p><p>"Yes, we will," Allison said as she grabbed Dan's hand. "Oh, and  talk to the Princess today about getting your gender thing fixed. I'm getting sick of having to reinstall the  program every week."</p><p>Gos looked around the empty room. "Well I guess I'll check in on Erika  then," he said before the projection switched off.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Rebecca growled as she studied her reflection.  It had taken over a dozen baths, but the glitter and pink dye in her  hair was finally starting to diminish.  The activities of her former test subject were... confusing.<p>It was clear that the girl had considerable power now, but she was spending a  lot of time making a garden. At least  the regular combat sparring and other training made sense.</p><p>Despite herself, Rebecca was impressed.  She had underestimated the power of the technology she was testing. It was clear that the redhead's programming  had rapidly advanced and likely had integrated into her.</p><p>While  Rebecca was curious as to what made such an event happen, she was more  curious as to what her test subject's powers were. She would have to  be... cautious. Her sensor drones had even been pulled back a  bit.</p><p>She looked at her reflection again. This prank was actually pretty clever. With such a clear and outrageous change to  her hair, she was forced to stay at home.  She would need more power. Her  current inventory of mechs was a good start, but it was time she used her second  test subject.</p><p>She sighed. This Ryoga person would need  considerable upgrades before he would stand a chance against the last version  of the first test subject. Rebecca knew  that this Rose person had to be much  stronger. Her second test subject would  have to have some new offensive weapons and some regeneration to start with.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Okay... I think that will solve your power issues," Ranma said as  she swiveled her laptop to face Sarah.<p>"Wow. That's an interesting upgrade to my power system," Sarah said, while  looking over the plans. "I think I can build this."</p><p>"Good," Ranma beamed. "I  just enlarged the capacity and streamlined a few things. Your original design is very powerful."</p><p>"Okay." Sarah transferred the  design to her laptop. "This is what I'm thinking of. I can double the volley capacity for my  micro-missiles and add a pair of medium laser mounts on these underside arm  slots," Sarah explained after pulling up a diagram of her armor system.</p><p>"Nice... this'll fit in well with  the rail-guns I've been working on for you," Ranma grinned. She then showed Sarah the rotating figure of  a large silver gun.</p><p>"You figured out how to make a rail-gun?" Sarah continued to be  impressed at her sister's progress.</p><p>Ranma blushed. "Not really, I modified one of Dan's old designs, made it  small enough to be carried by you, and upped the rate of fire."</p><p>"Still..." Sarah read over the abilities. "I see why you wanted to change my power  systems. The energy increase will be  just about eaten up by this and those  new shields."</p><p>"That's great! I'm happy that you like it!"</p><p>Sarah blinked at the exuberant girl. "I've still got to transfer the code  into my template and test it out."</p><p>"Of course..." Ranma blinked,  and an evil smile grew on her face.  "Hacker girl's back!"</p><p>"What? She's attacking?"</p><p>"Nope, it's just another one of her spy-bots," Ranma shrugged as she  got up from the kitchen table.</p><p>"You tapped into Dan's sensor network?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"Something like that," Ranma grinned. Then in a flash of green and  white light she transformed into Sailor Rose.</p><p>"Wait for me!" Sarah shifted into her template.</p><p>Rose jumped out the back door and extended her wings. She flew a dozen yards and adjusted her  heading and when she had a straight shot at her target released a thin pair of  red beams. "That's a hit!" Sailor Rose cheered.</p><p>Sarah followed her sister. She landed next to Rose who was disassembling a  good-sized robot. "That thing was  cloaked wasn't it?" she asked the Sailor Senshi.</p><p>"Yup," Sailor Rose said, her hand resting on the robot's computer  core. "Dang... hacker-girl really  keeps her stuff clean." She sighed  and shifted out of her Senshi-mode.</p><p>"You tracked it using Dan's system?" Sarah asked as she looked around  the forest. Ranma's garden was just behind them.</p><p>"Nope! I used that," Ranma  said pointing to a newly-planted rosebush that was on the side of the garden  closest to them.</p><p>"A plant?"</p><p>"Yup!"</p><p>"That came from Mom's rosebush, and I'm sure your magic did something to  it."</p><p>"Erika gave me the idea. I formed a  link to Mom's rosebush when I first found it.  I did the same to the new plants  I started from Mom's."</p><p>"And you added sensors to them?"</p><p>"After Erika suggested it. At first I just had them send me information  about sunlight, water, and the like," Ranma said as she shifted into  gardening clothes and checked on one of her plants.</p><p>"Sensors... plant?"</p><p>"Yes. Good job," Ranma said  patting the rosebush. "Makes sense.  You can add magic code to life-forms and plants are alive."</p><p>Sarah looked over the rosebush. "And Dan's system didn't pick up on  it?"</p><p>"Nope. You're right. I am watching the feed from that network," Ranma  said as she started looking over the other rosebushes.</p><p>"If your flowers work like that we could use them all over there. Make a new sensor net with them."</p><p>"You want me to plant more of these?" Ranma beamed.</p><p>"Yes, these freaky plants seem useful.  Hmm... Calash in plants. Guess  that makes sense."</p><p>"It'll take a while to plant enough to make a grid, and even then..." Ranma  summoned her palmtop and started making calculations using her green  stylus. "Wow, that's a lot."</p><p>"Will it require too many roses?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"There's no such thing as too many roses," Ranma corrected. She  tapped the stylus to her lips. "Though,  it's still just a passive system." She started writing a new series of  notes and designs.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"You know you're either brilliant or insane, right?" Erika asked her  sister.<p>"It was your idea to use rose plants as sensors." Ranma sat next to a  little rosebush. She looked over the  bush and gave it an affectionate pat. This bush even had a couple of flower  buds that were just about ready to bloom.</p><p>"At least they're growing well, but I guess you'd be good at raising them,  Princess Rose," Erika smiled.</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Sarah's sensor project almost delayed my gardening. Okay,  let's get this done."</p><p>"Right," Erika said. "Your plan is to pump magic using the  organic tech into the rosebush?"</p><p>"Yes, hopefully the rose will respond and adapt to meet my  requirements."</p><p>"That's what organic tech is supposed to do," Erika nodded.</p><p>"Starting now," Ranma said as she stood up. She closed her eyes and  shifted into her princess form.</p><p>"Getting formally dressed for this?" Erika smiled.</p><p>"My princess form is better adapted for this type of magic."</p><p>"Isn't this your default? You were  reborn dressed like this."</p><p>"Yes it is," Ranma agreed. "And my Senshi one has wings and is  better for purification and combat. I  mean, I can't kick wearing this," Ranma laughed as she pointed to her  gown's ankle-length skirt.</p><p>"Okay, so you think you need to channel this much power..."</p><p>"If I was going for raw power I'd be in senshi form. No, this requires  finesse, not blasting holes in things," Ranma said as she summoned her  wand.</p><p>The princess pointed the magical focus and poured her energy. The rosebush glowed green as the magic  started to alter it. One of the buds started to expand in size and pulse  with white energy.<br/>It eventually started to peel open, revealing a few petals encasing  something... something delicate, green,  winged, and possessing antennae.</p><p>"Wow..." Erika gasped noting the contents of the flower. "That's one way to get the mobility  requirement satisfied."</p><p>"Yup," Ranma smiled.  "Let's activate it and start testing."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"What the hell is that?" Allison asked as she watched a small  creature flutter into the living room.<p>"It's a fairy, honey," Dan said from his position slumped on the  couch. "Tiny girl with antennae and dragonfly wings. Dead giveaway,"  he then rolled over.</p><p>"I know what it looks like! But it can't be that! Everyone knows that  fairies went extinct during the industrial revolution."</p><p>"Since it's wearing a tiny little skirt made of rose petals and a bikini  top from the same material. I think that narrows down where it came from,"  Dan said still, laying on the couch.</p><p>"Erika's over today isn't she?"</p><p>Dan nodded.</p><p>Allison stood up, eyed the flying little green-skinned... girl and walked to  the back door and opened it. "What's  with the funny little golem?" the blonde shouted in the direction of the  garden.</p><p>She turned around and found the fairy flying just in front of her face.  "Least you're a cute little thing.  Man... Princess is making dolls now." She noticed the fairy's expression  change. "Don't frown at me... hey cool.  Wonder what else you can do?"</p><p>"She's not a golem," Ranma said as she and Erika slowly walked up  onto the back porch and into the kitchen.  She had her palmtop out and was making notes with her stylus.</p><p>"You don't dress like that in your garden.  Usually your fancy dress is for when you're reading your plant books or  when you're doing magic stuff."</p><p>"I did just make that." Ranma pointed to the fairy who was currently  examining Allison's hair.</p><p>"Yeah, it's a cute little golem," Allison said as she looked over the  fairy who now had changed from having deep emerald green hair to blonde.</p><p>"She's not a golem," Erika repeated. "She was made from a  rosebud."</p><p>"Fine, a plant golem. Still very  cool. She's very expressive,"  Allison then stuck her tongue out at the fairy and was pleased when it copied  the move.</p><p>"She's got an organic AI in her," Erika said.</p><p>"Uh... why? Is there a need for that? I mean what does she do."</p><p>"An excellent question. Ichi, please come over here." Ranma beckoned the fairy over.</p><p>"Yes princess," the fairy said in a high-cute voice. She flew over to  the redhead.</p><p>"Cool, she talks," Dan said after walking into the room, half of his  face red from lying on the couch.</p><p>"Of course she does. Ichi here is my latest security system. I wanted something that was more mobile than  my rose bushes and could react a bit if need be, so I put the requirements into  a plant and had my magic work on the problem, and this is what it came up  with."</p><p>Ichi bowed in midair.</p><p>Ranma pulled out her stylus and started pointing to various parts on the four  inch tall fairy. First were the antenna. "She's got the same sensor and  communications abilities as my stationary roses. She's strong relatively  speaking, so she can pick up things. Wings, of course, are her main locomotion.  She can photosynthesize, but she still needs water and other nutrients. If  you'll notice the bracers she's wearing: she packs a bit of a wallop. Nothing that can be used offensively, but for  defensive work it's good enough. They're also good for clearing weeds and  brush. Which is good for her gardening  use."</p><p>"She gardens too? Why am I not  surprised?" Allison sighed.</p><p>"Why wouldn't she? She's gonna be out in the garden most of the time any  way, except when she's powered down recharging in one their special rose  bushes."</p><p>"Why a fairy? I mean a big dragonfly or something would have done the  job," Dan inquired.</p><p>"Because they're cute," Ranma smiled.</p><p>"So, why's it bugging me then?" Allison asked as she looked at the  blonde fairy.</p><p>"She's curious. Side effect of  their sensor nature. You should be glad  I wanted them stealthy too. Otherwise she'd be a chatterbox, wouldn't you,  Ichi?"</p><p>"I suppose so, Princess," Ichi said after pausing to think.</p><p>"So she's got an AI because the tasks you wanted her to do needed to be  learned?" Dan asked.</p><p>"That and it's easier to have something that can learn how to weed than  for me to have to program it in manually."</p><p>"She's very flexible and has a lot of capability to learn things,"  Erika nodded in approval.</p><p>Ichi smiled at the praise.</p><p>"She's now wearing what I am!" Allison said as she examined the  little fairy.</p><p>"Talk to her about it then," Ranma dismissed.</p><p>"So, why are you copying me?"</p><p>Ichi paused to think. "You're very interesting," she finally  responded</p><p>"Oooo... Princess, I like her!" Allison  exclaimed.</p><p>"So how smart is she?" Dan asked.</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Right now she's got enough mental power to do what she  needs to do, but she is designed to learn more."</p><p>"Okay! What the hell is  that?" Sarah demanded as she walked  into the kitchen.</p><p>Ranma sighed as she gave her explanation again.</p><p>"Oh... that makes sense..." Sarah looked over the fairy. "So am  I the only one who picked up that her name means one in Japanese?"</p><p>"You're going to make more aren't you?" Dan asked.</p><p>"Just enough to help in the garden and patrol in shifts," Ranma said  as she looked down at her gown.</p><p>"Wonderful, our house is guarded by  rosebushes and fairies," Sarah  dryly remarked.</p><p>"They did put my system to shame," Dan pointed out.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"You want me to do what?" Ranma asked as she came in from gardening  and training. She was currently wearing her "Wild Rose" gi.<p>"My sex changing thing is just a copy of yours." Dan said as he  looked around to see if that fairy had followed Ranma in. He was still a bit weirded out by the  thing. Yesterday evening, he had even  had a little chat with the fairy, who struck him as very inquisitive but shy.</p><p>"But it's not complete and has to be reinstalled every week," Dan  continued. "I was wondering if you  could help with that."</p><p>"You like being a girl, don't you."  Ranma shifted into a blouse and skirt.</p><p>Dan shrugged. "Meh, I don't mind it, but Allison  really likes it. You saw how she got at  that cute Goth thing."</p><p>Ranma smiled. "Okay, I'll help you.  Shift into girl-form."</p><p>"Done," Dan said once she had turned female.</p><p>Ranma's finger glowed as she poked Dan in the forehead.</p><p>"Ow!"  Dan complained. "What  the? You didn't just get taller did  you?" Her gaze then went downward.  "Oh my..." Dan said as she looked at her enlarged assets. "Why  the hell am I so short?"</p><p>"No I idea. I ended up shorter too. All I did was make your body  real. More effective than that previous  copy curse you were using." The redhead then smiled playfully. "Oh  Allison! Someone wants to see  you!" Ranma shouted.</p><p>"I like," Allison purred as she entered the kitchen. "Thanks,  Princess," she said as she picked up Dan, who was now a few inches shorter  than Allison, and carried her out of the  room.</p><p>Ranma then turned to face a small fluttering figure behind her. "Yes,  Ichi?" she calmly asked. If it was  an emergency the fairy would have communicated directly with her mind.</p><p>"I found a rosebush that would make a great candidate, princess. It's very  healthy," Ichi said, almost shyly, as she transmitted the location and  some information about the plant</p><p>"I suppose you're getting lonely.  Have you finished your gardening?"</p><p>The fairy nodded enthusiastically. "Yes! Planting those roses for the  South end was a bit of a challenge, but I figured it out," she said  proudly.</p><p>Ranma smiled. Ichi was doing very well.  Even on difficult, open ended tasks. She would cautiously keep trying  things, until something worked. "Very well. Let's make you a friend," Ranma walked  back outside with the exuberant fairy.</p><p>The redhead laughed at the glee Ichi had. It was another positive sign. Ranma  was very curious as to how a pair of fairies interacted to solve problems as a  team. She would tell Dan about her proposed upgrades for the terminator  template later. Allison and Dan would be  busy for a while.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Where's your little friend?" Dan asked as she walked out to the back  porch. "Doesn't she normally read over your shoulder?"<p>"Ichi's teaching Ni how to weed," Ranma said not looking up from the  gardening book she checked out of the school library. She was sitting in one of  the reclining chairs that gave a partial view of her garden.</p><p>"Ni? You made another one. Took you long enough," Dan shrugged.</p><p>"I wanted to make sure Ichi was working out, and I had to wait for another  new bush to get healthy enough," Ranma said as she turned to a new page.</p><p>"Why aren't you there with them?"</p><p>"I'm seeing how well Ni can learn and if Ichi is capable enough to  teach."</p><p>"Oh, I see. So why are you reading the actual book? Can't you just flip through  it scan every page and read it later at a high speed?"</p><p>Ranma closed her book and folded her hands in her lap over it. "I like the  topic and I want to absorb everything I can. So, I'm going slow."</p><p>"Fair enough." Dan eyed the long gown the girl was wearing. "But  why are you in your princess dress?"</p><p>"I'm relaxing," Ranma said as she looked at her book.</p><p>"Hmmmm?"</p><p>"When I relax all the way, I go into my default mode," Ranma said as  she looked at the line of roses that spiraled up her dress. It also helped that  she really enjoyed her dress. She had taken the time to design it and all the  accompanying accessories.</p><p>"Oh... I see. I guess I'll let you read in peace."</p><p>"Sorry." Ranma apologized, and looked at Dan. "So did Allison  like the new Dianna?"</p><p>Dan coughed. "Well... she got pissed when she tried to play dress up and  her bras wouldn't fit me." He  grinned. "But I got her over  it."</p><p>"Glad to help," Ranma laughed. She shifted into a rose-accented  blouse and green skirt and summoned her laptop.</p><p>"Done relaxing?"</p><p>"Well, since you're here, I have a few ideas for your template."</p><p>Dan raised an eyebrow. "Really,  now?"</p><p>"Yes, remember that third Terminator movie?"</p><p>"It sucked, so? Just last week we watched it and made fun of it."</p><p>"That's what gave me the idea," Ranma smiled as she pulled up a few  files.</p><p>Dan studied the schematics and nodded approvingly. "Just one issue. Does it have to be a girl terminator?"</p><p>"You're not more concerned about the nanotechnology I've suggested?"</p><p>Dan shrugged. "Not really. It's not  like even you could pull that off."</p><p>"Oh, a challenge!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Are you sure you should be doing this, Ichi?" Ni asked as she flew through the forest on  patrol. The communication was through the connection they shared.<p>"Of course, Princess Rose made us to follow her orders, observe, and  learn," Ichi transmitted to the  other fairy. She turned back to watching her princess train.</p><p>"I suppose so. You do have no current tasks to complete," Ni relented  as she scanned the woods.</p><p>"You're just jealous that I'm free to watch her," Ichi teased. She  had recently learned of the concept and it intrigued her. The fairy then smiled  as she watched her creator leap up, rebound off of a tree trunk, flip in  midair, tumble to the ground and stick a perfect landing before seamlessly  transitioning into her next move.</p><p>"Hey! I'm just gonna see it tonight when we sync up our memories," Ni  shrugged as she investigated an unusual spike in the ambient magic field. It  was just an outcropping of rocks that seemed to churn the energy immediately  surrounding it.</p><p>The fairy flew around the rock a few times studying it. She then resumed her patrol marking that as  something to return to when she had free time.</p><p>"Oh... nice anomaly. That's a good  trade," Ichi smiled as she resumed  watching Rose train.</p><p>Ranma smiled as she listened to the fairies chatter. They were really starting  to grow on her. As she practiced a series of mid-air kicks she made a mental  note to make a third one when a rosebush got strong enough. They seemed to do so much better when in a  team.</p><p>The redhead flipped around and bounced off another tree, causing the nearby  fairy to yelp and dart out of the way.  When she landed on the ground she was just in front of her sister,  Sarah.</p><p>"Don't scare the fairies,"  Sarah teased. She then looked  around the area of the forest. "Odd  place to practice."</p><p>"The range was too bland. Now that I don't have to worry about being watched  by the hacker girl I can cut loose a bit more," Ranma laughed.</p><p>"But, this is your garden..."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"Flowers and martial arts don't mix."</p><p>"Really now," Ranma drawled as she narrowed her eyes. "I am  making a dojo as well as a garden. If you can't tell the difference between the  garden and the dojo then I'm doing a good job.  Wild Rose school can't be taught in a normal hall after all."</p><p>"Just seems like you'd damage your plants," Sarah defended.</p><p>"Don't worry I've got it worked out," Ranma said as she summoned her  palmtop and displayed a map on it.  "See, the rosebushes are on the edges of the really heavy training  areas which are bordered with grass. The more moderate stuff is mixed with the  gardens and accessed by paths."</p><p>"Are those a bunch of vertical bamboo poles inside a huge rose  patch?" Sarah said examining the notations on the map.</p><p>"It's for balance training."</p><p>"You want people jumping over rose plants?"</p><p>"It'll be very pretty. Besides, my roses can handle it."</p><p>"But thorns!"</p><p>"I told you. It's for balance training," Ranma smiled. "Of  course Mom's rosebush is in the center  right in what will be the mediation area."</p><p>Her face brightened as she used her stylus to alter the map. "That's what  it was missing! I'll put a big koi pond right there.  There's a natural basin right in that part of the western spur."</p><p>"Koi pond?"</p><p>"Yeah, there was one back at the Tendo's, it was great. Very good for training." Ranma looked at the map and sighed.</p><p>"What's wrong? Your plans too  complicated?"</p><p>"No, that's just a matter of time," Ranma smiled weakly and made her  palmtop appear.</p><p>"The Nerima thing? Don't worry  about them," Sarah said as she put her hand on her sister's shoulder. "Even  if they did come here you could handle them, not like they'll even get here."</p><p>"I'm not worried about that, Sis," Ranma sighed. "It's hard to explain. Maybe it's that I have time to think about  something other than getting free of the template. Maybe it's my  transformation, but I'm kind of regretting how I left them."</p><p>"You can't undo what you did. Besides, you did fine," Sarah  reassured.</p><p>"I guess so. I'm a little bit curious what happened to them though."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"How humiliating," Nabiki sighed as she looked around the airport  terminal. A seeming phalanx of angry and  heavily-armed policemen watched them.<p>"You're humiliated?" Akane shouted.  "At lest you're not handcuffed!" She raised her hands a few  inches showing that she was wearing two pairs of cuffs. One to secure her hands to each other and one  to secure her hand to the armrest of the chair.</p><p>"You know I can rip this chair out of the floor?" Akane shouted to  the tall police lieutenant.</p><p>Nabiki dropped her head into her hands.  This had started out as such a good idea. She had gotten Kuno to fund  this whole trip, and things had gone well. Sure every lead on Ranma eventually  led to a dead end, but it was still a free vacation. They even got a few rumors  that someone matching Ranma's description had moved further south. Then cops  showed up.</p><p>"Miss, please don't force us to secure you further," stated Lieutenant  Ray Walter, one very exasperated policeman, through a translator.</p><p>"I can't believe it ended this way," Cologne sighed from her seat  further down the line.</p><p>"Great-grandmother, why can't we go?" Shampoo asked in her native  language. She was cuffed much like Akane was.</p><p>"Silence. You will obey me or I'll  subdue you myself!" Cologne reprimanded. She sighed. At least Mousse was back in Nerima minding  the shop. That was one less problem to  deal with.</p><p>"Can you please stick to languages I understand?" the translator requested.</p><p>"This does seem a bit odd. We didn't  do anything wrong," Akane grumbled.</p><p>"Tell that to the six Seattle SWAT officers that got injured, that's a  quarter of our force. You can see that the rest have to baby-sit you guys. You  folks are very lucky things didn't escalate."</p><p>"Tatewaki and his sister are drugged up!" Akane shouted.</p><p>"He's still under from the surgery. The doctors were amazed at how much  trauma he could take."</p><p>"You didn't have to electrocute him," Akane muttered.</p><p>"He did come at officers with a sword,"</p><p>"It was wooden," Nabiki noted.</p><p>"Big factor why he's still alive. He's lucky they got a chance to hit him  with stun guns. If he'd charged us with live steel, we would have been forced  to shoot him."</p><p>"You still beat him with clubs," Nabiki smiled. That was an amusing  sight.</p><p>"We got him to drop his weapon but he was still a threat," Walter  shrugged. "As for his sister, she was drugged up from exposure to her own  chemicals. Chemicals that are quite  illegal, I might add."</p><p>"You guys did burst into our hotel room guns drawn." Nabiki stated. "It's  our fault you morons got the address wrong?  I guess American police really are overzealous thugs."</p><p>"Ma'am, nothing would have happened if your friends had not resisted  us," Lieutenant Walter explained. "Instead we got three women  attacking us and one sword wielding loon."</p><p>"I still can't believe Kodachi drugged herself," Akane murmured.</p><p>"It's not like her potions can go through a gasmask," Nabiki stated.</p><p>What disturbed Walter the most was how lucky his men had gotten. One of the girls had disabled herself.  Another was ordered to stand down by the old woman. The last had fought but was  held back a bit by her older sister.  That left the sword-guy. Even he  was a huge problem to bring down.</p><p>"Yes... a lovely cloud of toxic chemicals.  That was a great addition to the situation." Walter removed his  sunglasses. "If it were up to me, I'd have you girls charged with  everything we've got. But the district attorney wants this situation quieted  up."</p><p>"It <i>would</i> look bad in the  papers. A bunch of cops raiding and  beating Japanese tourists, most of whom are schoolgirls," Nabiki smirked.</p><p>"That's the DA's opinion of things." Walter nodded. Cologne and  Shampoo were Chinese, but the news media would not bother to make that  distinction.</p><p>"So you're just going to kick us out of the country?" Cologne asked,  in English.</p><p>"Yes, the six of you are to board that plane and return to Japan,"  Walter stated.</p><p>"Great Grandmother?" Shampoo asked.</p><p>"Yes, we will find him, but on our own," Cologne reassured, in their  local dialect of Chinese. She narrowed her eyes and looked at the others.  "Without all this baggage."</p><p>Walter  looked at the translator who shrugged. He sighed. This old woman was  troublesome. She seemed way too accommodating. "Are you going to take  this deal?"  he asked, some hope entering his voice.  Once they were on the plane they would no longer be his problem.</p><p>"We don't have any choice. This trip's been fun, but I want to go  home," Nabiki stated.</p><p>"I don't think Ranma's even in this city, at least not anymore. That creepy little freak probably lied to  you, Sis." Akane said as she tugged on her handcuffs.</p><p>"Yes. It's looking more and more  like a wild goose chase. Something to waste our time," Nabiki  growled. It seemed that Hikaru had  gotten the last laugh on her.</p><p>"We spent over two weeks looking for him here, and there was no real sign  of him," Cologne sighed. Ranma was somewhere in this country but not in  this city.</p><p>Shampoo looked at the floor. She had  tracked Ranma before, she would track him down again.</p><p>"We were done here anyway,"  Cologne said.</p><p>Walter looked to the two unconscious Kunos and smiled. "That's very  good. Your flight boards in ten minutes.  I trust you folks can stay calm until then."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"What did you do?" Ranma asked  as she looked up from the rosebush that she was tending. It had just started to flower and she was  inspecting the petals.<p>"I just changed a couple numbers in a police database," Gos explained  with a sigh. "You sure we can't talk inside?"</p><p>"So it's gonna start to rain," Ranma shrugged. She was rather fond of  the feeling of wet soil between her toes.</p><p>"I don't like the rain."</p><p>"Spoilsport." Ranma got up and dusted her hands on her shorts. She mentally checked to make sure Ichi and Ni  knew about the coming precipitation and were ready for it. "So, you  altered the dispatch of a SWAT team? Sounds dangerous," she said as they  walked back to the house.</p><p>"Well I knew that the criminals weren't in the original location of the  raid. They wouldn't have met them  anyway. It was too good an opportunity to pass up. It was in their hotel suite.  Was quite nice, it had several adjoining rooms and a balcony. All I had do to  was change the room number, and alter the hotel's records a bit," Gos  explained. "I have been keeping tabs on their entire little Seattle  adventure</p><p>"Still... having cops smash into that group," Ranma shook her head.  "At least no one important got hurt."</p><p>"What's wrong Ranma? I thought you'd be happy. They'll have a really hard time getting back  into the States. Isn't this what you wanted?"</p><p>"I guess." The redhead tugged at her hair bow.</p><p>Gos rolled his eyes. "Look, it's  their own fault they got kicked out. If  they'd have just kept their cool they'd still be free to roam the countryside  looking for you. It was their own nature that got them in trouble."</p><p>"You still took advantage of them. I didn't want them hurt."</p><p>"And, discounting Kuno, you got that. Personally, I'm kinda  disappointed." Gos glared. "Don't get soft on me, Princess. You gave me permission to do this little  scheme. You're so concerned about those  people you can deal with them if you want.  You clearly find my methods unacceptable."</p><p>"Sorry, I didn't realize it was such a sensitive thing with you,"  Ranma placated.</p><p>"I didn't offer to do this just because I owed you. I did it for myself  too."</p><p>Erika's projection suddenly appeared. "I'm sorry sis, but I have to agree  with Gos. You do know that Tatewaki hurt  six men during that night. Two of them  seriously. Also remember that they were  coming to take you back by force." She sighed. "Sis, you've got a big  heart... but..." She paused there was no delicate way to put this.  "You're still thinking fast, not smart."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Ranma sighed.  "I know, alone some of them  are pretty okay. Not the guys or Kodachi, but the girls: Ukyou, Akane, Kasumi,  Shampoo, even Nabiki. However, get them in a group..."</p><p>"I told you earlier that was just how they would act," Gos stated. "And if they did that near you and your  family? You know what Sarah, Dan, and Allison are like. They would waste those  guys without hesitating. I did them a favor by just sending SWAT after  them."</p><p>"They would do anything to protect me, wouldn't they?" Ranma blinked.</p><p>"Yeah, congratulations, you've got a great family," Gos deadpanned.</p><p>"Look at it this way, too. Maybe those nimrods learned something from  this. That there's consequences to their  actions," Erika interjected.</p><p>"One can only hope," Gos grumbled.</p><p>Ranma's face brightened. She knew she should not get her hopes up, but a little  cautious optimism helped. Either way, the world's largest ocean was once again  between them and her.</p><p>"Look, it's over with." Erika said before swapping Gos for the solid  body. "And next time they start sniffing around for you, you handle it,  Sis," she offered wrapping an arm around her.</p><p>"You're powerful enough to take care of them as you see fit," Gos  agreed.</p><p>"Thanks guys," Ranma said as she hugged Erika.</p><p>"Sorry to interrupt your hug-fest. but unless you want to get  soaked..." Sarah said from the back porch.</p><p>"No! Let them stay out! Wet T-shirt  contest!" Allison teased from next to the redhead.</p><p>"I wear bras now, you know!" Ranma shouted back.</p><p>"No fun," Allison mock-pouted. "Good thing I've got my  Diana!"</p><p>"What was that about having a great family?" Ranma asked Gos.</p><p>"Well..."</p><p>"Come to think of it, you're a part of it too," Ranma smiled as they  walked up the steps onto the porch.</p><p>"I am?"</p><p>"Erika's my sister and you're her boyfriend."</p><p>"Yeah, that works," Allison nodded. "I mean, I'm a part of the  family."</p><p>"Yes. Yes, you are," Sarah theatrically-sighed.</p><p>"Maybe they should move in then? Allison did." Dan suggested "We  do have a spare room."</p><p>"You mean the guest room that Allison supposedly uses?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"It would save on asking people to give us lifts..." Gos noted.</p><p>"You're over here enough anyway." Sarah noted.</p><p>"And we can move out of that horrible apartment!" Erika cried.</p><p>"Sean's a good friend of mine. He was the one that gave me my first I/O  sphere," Gos said as he walked into the house with the rest of them.</p><p>"His apartment's still small and stinky," Erika said while scrunching  up her nose.</p><p>"The bedrooms here <i>are</i> larger."  Gos paused to think.</p><p>"It's not our choice," Sarah reminded them.</p><p>"Fine, I'll call," Ranma said  she flipped her hand and a white cell-phone with green lettering appeared in  her hand. Leaning on the kitchen counter she typed the number to the Lockridge  police station.</p><p>"We do have a landline," Sarah noted.</p><p>"Ranma's always been a show off," Gos said.</p><p>"Hi!  Dad! I'm good. Thanks for  asking. How are you doing? Awww... sorry to hear  that. I hope your deputy feels better soon.  You work too much with just your own stuff, Dad. Say... I was  wondering. You know Gos and Erika? Yes they're the couple that shares a  body. Uh huh.  Well they're looking for a better place to stay. Oh... well what about  Dan's room?"</p><p>From his office, Jack O'Neil, looked out his window into the pouring rain and  sighed. "Sorry Ranma, there's no way Allison's parents would let her live  in the same room as her boyfriend. Maybe  if she is bunking with her girlfriend... well. I might be able to talk them  into it."</p><p>Ranma blinked. "That's very silly sounding."</p><p>"Allison's parents insisted on them having separate bedrooms even though  that doesn't stop anything," Jack explained.</p><p>"Okay, I'll tell them, thanks  Dad!" Ranma said before hanging up. She then explained the conditions to  her family.</p><p>"Why does everything around me seem to do it's best to make me stay a  girl?" Dan shook his head.</p><p>"Hey, I know how you feel man," Ranma sympathized.</p><p>He looked over to see the redhead had shifted into a red dress with a green  vine pattern "That's not helping Ran-man," he sighed</p><p>"Like you'd be spending any less time as a guy in bed," Allison  snorted. "Have you forgotten how well things work now that Princess has  improved your girl-side?"</p><p>"That's more information than I needed to hear," Sarah said as she  walked out of the room.</p><p>"Come on, Erika. Let's talk about  your template," Ranma said, while grabbing her other sister's hand and  leading her upstairs.</p><p>"You have an idea for a battle template for me?" Erika asked, once  they were in Ranma and Sarah's room.</p><p>"Take it. Sis really has a knack for improvements and upgrades,"  Sarah said from her lower bunk. Her laptop was out and she was working on her own template.</p><p>"Thanks," Ranma blushed. "I have to get more data from my  fairies. Preferably, with twice the number I have," Ranma said as she  mentally requested Ichi to come to her.</p><p>Erika smiled.</p><p>"I <i>knew</i> there was more to them  than just sensors, gardening and curious chit chat!" Sarah grinned.</p><p>"It's no coincidence that they use the same type of organic programming as  Erika and I. Observing how they grow and develop has been very  informative," Ranma admitted as her laptop appeared.</p><p>"Like flying lab rats?"</p><p>"I'm here, Princess," Ichi bowed after flying into the room. She then  turned to Sarah. "I suppose that's correct Sarah-san, but data collection  is critical to advancement. If Princess  Rose can learn from me while I complete my tasks I'm serving her on two  levels."</p><p>"My, she's getting bolder," Sarah noted. "Now how did you get  into the house?"</p><p>Ichi blushed, causing her green skin to darken to match her hair. "It was  a very interesting problem to solve. I  had the strength to turn the knob but not the leverage," the fairy said as  she flew over to see what Sarah was working on.</p><p>"Ichi here is a good demonstration," Ranma said waving her hand at  the fairy that was studying Sarah's armor designs.</p><p>"Wouldn't Ni be just as good? I mean, their memories are synced up every  night. Clever way to build their experiences and capabilities, Sis," Sarah  said.</p><p>"I didn't come up with it. It's how  Ichi taught Ni. She was the one that came up with it."</p><p>"Wow, nice going Ichi," Erika complimented.</p><p>"Thank you Erika-san. It was the most efficient way to teach her,"  Ichi blushed, her skin turning a darker green.</p><p>"I was using her as an example for the application of living magic on a  living host."</p><p>"So she's practice?"</p><p>"For bigger things," Ranma smiled.</p><p>"Still it's a long way from roses to humans," Erika said.</p><p>"Oh... that's what you're planning for Erika's template," Sarah's  eyes widened in realization.</p><p>"Did you expect anything else from me? I'm a princess who's a Sailor  Senshi."</p><p>Erika nodded. "I really like the  irony. I mean, I'm one of Gos' creations  - makes sense I'd wear one of his other ones."</p><p>"You know there is one really good upside to this. This won't make anymore roses." Sarah joked.</p><p>"You're right. Can't have two  Sailor Roses," Ranma nodded.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Just watch," Ranma told her  father as she powered up her wand.<p>"It's gonna be that bush then?"  Jack asked pointing to the little rosebush.</p><p>"It's been growing very well." The gown wearing girl nodded as she  closed her eyes and enveloped the plant in her energy. The plant glowed green  as one of its flower buds started to grow in size.</p><p>The lawman watched the transformation intently.  Soon the flower opened and a fairy, identical to the other two emerged.  The tiny green woman stretched and flexed her wings. She then flew up to face  her princess and bowed.</p><p>"San, please go find Ni and sync with her."</p><p>"Yes, Princess," the fairy said before flying off.</p><p>"Once she does that she'll know everything they know?" O'Neil asked.  "Impressive."</p><p>"Thanks, Dad!" Ranma beamed as she led her father down a  pathway. "I'll show you how helpful  they've been!"</p><p>As the two slowly weaved their way through the garden, Ranma explained the  things she had done. Jack smiled at how  his daughter was carrying herself. Using  the official plant names and other technical terms, she was even still wearing  her princess clothing. "Daughter, how can you walk in heels like that on  rough ground? That long dress can't help either."</p><p>"It's just training. Balance for  martial arts, and deportment for being a princess," Ranma shrugged and  went back to explaining the stones she was thinking of using for the rock  garden section.</p><p>"I know Genma gave you an incredible amount of martial arts training, but  when did you go through princess training?"</p><p>"Ever since my transformation I've been researching and training in how I  should act," Ranma admitted.</p><p>"Fair enough. So, all these roses came from Nodoka's bush?" Jack  asked, amazed at what the girl could do in just under a week. He could see what  had to be at least a hundred  plants. Only a few of them were  flowering, and among those he could see a variety of colors.</p><p>Ranma smiled. "Yes, some are now fourth  generation plants from Mother's. Only  the first batch of second gens, those that are  cuttings from Mom's plant itself, are clones.  The rest as you can see have been altered. I can't wait until they start to seed. Then I can have some real fun with that group  of plants."</p><p>"Wow. You're doing great here." Jack then looked to see that all  three fairies flying around a running hose. "Aww...  looks like it got away from them. I think watering may be too much for  them."</p><p>"Wait, Dad," Ranma said with a  slight smile.</p><p>He then watched as San fired red beams into the water pouring out of the  hose. The steam was then hit with a  green beam fired by the Ichi and coalesced into a cloud that while small was  many, many times larger than her.</p><p>She then flew off with the cloud tethered to her by that same green beam. Ni fairy then made another cloud and flew off  with it. San then flew over to the hose  faucet and turned off the flow.</p><p>"They're watering with clouds?"</p><p>"Yup! According to them, they're surprisingly easy to make with magic.  This is another reason why I'm working on that pond. A big pool of water near  the center of the garden will really help watering," Ranma said.</p><p>"You girls never cease to amaze me," Jack smiled as he put his arm  around his daughter's shoulder. "First Sarah showing off that new template  of hers this morning at the range and now this... garden."</p><p>Ranma sighed happily as she leaned onto him. "Really? Sarah's done? That's  great!"</p><p>Jack nodded. "I wonder how they came up with that idea."</p><p>"We'll ask them," Ranma said as she called San over to them.</p><p>"Yes, Princess, Sheriff  O'Neil?" San bowed.</p><p>"That's the fairy you just made?" Jack asked. Unless they were copying someone's hair or  clothing the fairies were all identical.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And she's already gotten all the information from the other two. Again, amazing."  He turned to the expectant fairy. "So what gave you the idea to water the  plants that way?"</p><p>"When asked to water we researched it in an encyclopedia the princess had  in her memory. We learned that plants  normally get their water from rain. So  we looked up rain. Rain is water vapor  condensed into clouds in the air. We  then found that by heating water past the boiling point you get water vapor.</p><p>"It  took a few tries, but eventually we managed to get controllable cloud  formation. Thank you for creating me, by the way. Ichi believes that a  third fairy was helpful  in our success."</p><p>"That's a roundabout way of doing it. Very clever," Jack  congratulated the fairy.</p><p>"Thank you." San blushed. "Princess, is that all?"</p><p>"Yes, you may go," Ranma said.</p><p>San bowed again and flew off.</p><p>"I've got one more thing to show you," Ranma said as she shifted her  clothing. "You've seen the magical and gardening sides of Wild Rose  school. Now for its martial side,"  she said wearing her gi.</p><p>Ranma stretched slightly before leaping into the air, she then twisted and  bounced off a tree branch before firing at a small ki-ball at a vertical target  log. She bounded off the ground and then  landed on top of the same log.</p><p>Jack nodded and watched as his daughter continued her routine. She kept firing at various target logs from  contorted midair positions. Jack strongly suspected Sarah had mentioned to  Ranma that she had finally beaten him in a target shoot.</p><p>Eventually Ranma finished her display and landed in font of her father.  "What do you think, Dad?" She asked a</p><p>"Again, you're amazing. So this garden really will be a training  ground," Jack nodded.</p><p>"Thanks!" Ranma gushed.</p><p>"Well, let's see how the others are doing. Dan seems to be taking the new  sleeping arrangements well," Jack noted as they walked back to the house.</p><p>"It's not a big change for him, really. I'm glad that Allison's parents were  okay with it though."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Thanks for letting us use your truck," Gos said as he loaded a box into the back of  the black Suburban.<p>"No problem," Dan said as he put another box in.</p><p>"I just wish Sean could have helped, but he's at his mother's until  Sunday," Gos explained.</p><p>"What kind of paint job is that?" Erika asked, standing next to  Ranma.</p><p>"Creepy, moving black stuff," Ranma, who was wearing a blouse and  matching skirt, shrugged</p><p>"How much stuff did you two have?  You moved here after Ran-man," Dan asked as he and Gos went back  into the apartment.</p><p>"Erika's a girl, and we ordered more equipment when we moved in," Gos  shrugged.</p><p>"Gos is right about that. If I didn't have magical clothes..." Ranma shook  her head as she and Erika followed the guys.</p><p>"That's because you like to try every possible combination of various  shades of red, white, and green combined with different ways of adding  roses," Erika countered.</p><p>Ranma blushed.</p><p>"Maybe you should get some new colors Ran-man," Dan suggested as he  picked up a pair of flat-panel monitors.</p><p>"Roses do come in more colors than red," Gos reminded. He then  pointed at a box.</p><p>"Yeah, it might surprise you but I  know all the colors roses come in,"  Ranma glared.</p><p>"Then wear something else. There  are black roses," Gos smiled darkly.</p><p>"No, just no," Ranma shuddered in revulsion. "I'll try  some other colors."</p><p>"Blue would look good on you," Erika added.</p><p>"We can talk after we get the truck loaded," Dan suggested.</p><p>"Yeah, that would," Ranma admitted before carrying a box to the car.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sheriff O'Neil looked around the town  hall conference room. It was surprisingly dark for a government room. Seated before him in at a trio of tables  formed into a U shape were the Townfathers.  This was the collection of men and women who ran Lockridge. Only half of them were members of the town  government in any official way. The rest  were important in other capacities. He  had just finished his weekly briefing.  It was all the standard minutia of policing a small town.<p>"Oh, I heard you've adopted your wife's first child," Mayor Kenneth  Loren said, almost causally, from the head of  the U, directly opposite the lawman. Loren looked respectable without being too  dapper. Critical for being a small town  mayor. His slicked-back thinning white  hair and plain face helped with that.</p><p>"Yes, I did," Jack O'Neil  said.</p><p>The other Townfathers muttered briefly.  "Is it true about her nature?"  Alden Jefferson of the utility department asked.</p><p>"She does have some very advanced Calash in her, yes," Jack allowed.</p><p>"You can vouch for her stability, I assume," Loren stated.  He was now looking critically at the lawman.</p><p>"Of course. She's my daughter. I am responsible for her," Jack  casually shrugged.</p><p>"Good," Loren smiled, his face  taking an amused cast. "If only  more parents around here took responsibility for their children," he said  as he looked at the assembled Townfathers.</p><p>"It is rumored that her... condition is due to the actions of  another. There's no chance of things  becoming... explosive between your daughter and her rival?" the man next  to Jefferson asked.</p><p>"That would entirely be up to Ranma's rival. She is the one that has been antagonizing,  not just Ranma, but my entire family," Jack sternly stated.</p><p>"We are in a risky situation. More  advanced Calash use is encouraged, but this risks more attention being brought  to us," Loren moderated.</p><p>Jack stood still. He had some idea what  the Townfathers were planning. For one,  it had a long timetable and was only just now reaching the halfway point.</p><p>"We should not overly concern ourselves with these children. You all remember what it was like when we  were young," Richard Stockworth who  sat across from Jefferson smiled in remembrance. He was the head of the Lockridge branch  of Rotary International.</p><p>"Yes, there are larger  organizations that threaten us," Jefferson remarked.</p><p>Loren shot a glare at Jefferson before turning to O'Neil. "Always a  pleasure, Jack. Best of luck with your  family," the mayor smiled.</p><p>"Thank you sir. If you have nothing else I'll be going now," O'Neil  said picking up the cue to leave. He  turned and left the room.</p><p>"You're still concerned with Winston's plans?" Stockworth almost  smiled. "The man is a  businessman. His interest is purely  economical. Revealing Calash does not  profit him."</p><p>"Only because he understands the risks of what would happen to his company  if he went public with it," Jefferson smiled darkly. "That's the risk you take when you run a  family business. It makes you very susceptible to... leverage."</p><p>"I don't believe it will come down to that. Robert Winston knows how to  play ball. He doesn't even live in Lockridge anymore," Loren shrugged.  "Besides... I think this new 'Princess' will prove to be a large concern  for us."</p><p>"I doubt she'd try a coup." Stockworth laughed.</p><p>"There's no need. She's young and  connected." Loren smiled. "Don't be surprised if in ten years  she's sitting at this table."</p><p>The Townfathers looked amongst themselves.</p><p>"You really believe she's that powerful?" Alice Franklin,  superintended of the town schools asked.</p><p>Stockworth nodded. "She has the potential, and if she really does think of  herself as a princess..."</p><p>"Then political ascension is something she'll want to do." Lorenz  completed.</p><p>"So she might see Lockridge as her private magic kingdom?" Jefferson grumbled.</p><p>"I wouldn't worry about her," Loren dismissed. "In fact, I see  this situation as potentially quite useful.  She even knows that Ned Winston fellow."</p><p>"We should keep an eye on her. If  she shows as much promise as you suggest, then we could have her be an asset to  us," Alice proposed.</p><p>"Perhaps, but it's too early for us to make a move," Loren  cautioned. "We have to be sure of  what's going on. A little bit more  patience can't hurt."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"You sure about this?" Sailor  Rose asked Sarah as she ran a hand over the runes on one of her bracers. The  two redheads were on the range and were both in combat mode.<p>"We've tested my shield with all sorts of weapons over a dummy target  until it failed," the armor-clad girl sighed. "But sometime we have  to test it when it's on me. You did design this system!"</p><p>"That is true," Rose agreed.</p><p>"Just remember no wand. When you get with that wand scary things  happen," Sarah said as she looked to see a fairy watching them. The tiny-green girl smiled and shifted her  hairstyle to match Sarah's.</p><p>"I've only made four so far,"  Rose said.</p><p>"And how many do you plan to make?"</p><p>"Not too many. Two more should be  able to cover the garden duty and patrolling the grounds nicely."</p><p>"Half a dozen? Okay," Sarah  shrugged. "Guess you really are a fairy princess."</p><p>Sailor Rose pouted slightly.</p><p>"You're the one that decided to make them with fairy bodies instead of  something else," Sarah laughed.</p><p>"You're right." Rose then  smiled as her bracers started to glow. "I suggest you power up your  shields now. You wouldn't want to get  your pretty new armor scratched."</p><p>"That's the spirit," Sarah said as she activated her shields. A slight blue shimmer bubbled around her.</p><p>"Okay, Sis," Sailor Rose said  as she powered up her bracers. A pair of  thick beams lanced out of her hands and struck the shield. Part of the beams diffused into the shield  but the majority reflected off of it. Rose stopped the beams and gave the  thumbs up to her sister.</p><p>"That was... interesting," Sarah blinked.</p><p>"You're okay?" Sailor Rose asked.</p><p>"Yeah fine," Sarah said as she shifted out of template.</p><p>"Great! We've just got to test your new weapons then and you'll be  done," Rose smiled as she pulled  out her palmtop. "Hmm... still  working with Dan on his stuff, and Erika's coming over soon."</p><p>"What are you doing with her now?"  Sarah asked. She was not too fond  of the magical girl's smile.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I should have known this would be your idea," Gos said as he and  Erika stood out in Ranma's garden.<p>"Erika helped," Ranma said.</p><p>"It was an interesting idea to increase the power of a template while  reducing the risk," Erika said as she checked her status.</p><p>"Yes instead of a full merger like Ranma did, we just increase our bonding  to a template that uses advanced organic tech. What our little princess calls  living magic."</p><p>Ranma narrowed her eyes.</p><p>"It is a symbiotic bonding with some very high powered magic. We do need a  combat template, Gos," Erika reminded.</p><p>"Yes and in theory it all works out," Gos grudgingly nodded. "In  exchange for lower power levels the risk is reduced to a sane amount. Besides  with two of us in this body a full merger would be... troublesome."</p><p>"So what's holding you back?" Erika asked.</p><p>"Clearly it's the uniform. Don't you want to see your girlfriend dressed  like that?" Ranma teased. "You did make that type of uniform for  me."</p><p>"Fine. Let's do it then," Gos shrugged. He then vanished as the  projector generating his image shut down.</p><p>"You sure about this?" Ranma  asked. "You really want to be one  of my senshi?"</p><p>"Sure working with you sounds good," Erika said as she readied her  programming.</p><p>"Great!" Ranma then shifted  into her princess mode and pointed her wand at Erika. The white rosebud at the end opened and green  and blue energy came out and enveloped Erika. It spiraled around the girl and  coalesced into clothing of an expected pattern and theme. "I see you went with willow  blossoms. Very pretty," Princess  Rose said as her wand powered down. She would check to see if there were any  willow trees nearby.</p><p>"Wow, so this is what it feels  like," Sailor Willow said as she used white-gloved hands to adjust her  deep blue skirt. "Are the heels  really needed?"</p><p>Ranma smiled. "I'm afraid so. It's part of the uniform, just like the  jewelry and bows. At least you have  high-heeled boots. Besides, the uniform's not that bad."</p><p>Gos then flashed into existence. "Man... the irony of you saying that.  Though I guess you like this type of fuku now." Gos looked over Erika.  "You know you look just like Sailor Mercury, right?"</p><p>"You're the one that gave me blue hair," Sailor Willow reprimanded.</p><p>"And she really doesn't. Mercury  did not have light green bows, nor did  she have a lacy choker, with willow blossoms or anything floral really."</p><p>"So why did you pick willows?" Ranma asked after transforming back to  her gardening clothes.</p><p>"Lovely flowers and trees. They get  very strong and very big. Grow real easy  from clippings. For a powerbase they're pretty common. Unfortunately, they only  bloom for a short period too," Willow explained, before reverting back to  Erika.</p><p>"That's good, given that this plant's going to be your powerbase. It's  bigger because you have a tree, but it also takes longer to grow and mature," Ranma then smiled evilly. "Looks like  I've got my first student."</p><p>"In?"</p><p>"Wild Rose school of course. I'll teach you how to use your powers, fight,  garden, and, if I'm feeling thorough, manners and deportment."</p><p>"Well, I do need to learn how to  fight, and how to plant willows," Erika sighed.</p><p>"You," Gos pointed to Ranma," can teach manners? Did that princess stuff get to you that  much?"</p><p>"It was mostly a joke, though come to think of it, manners is really just  learning how to control your actions in a social situation. If you really want I can come up with some  training that uses it," Ranma then grabbed Erika's arm. She checked the  map of plants that her fairies had composed. "Good there's a few around here.  We should pick out your willow. This is the best part!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ned rode the elevator taking him from a subbasement to a ground level floor of  his family's Teakettle Ridge facility. He then walked the corridors until he  came to South Building where his apartment was. The teen would rather spend  more time building in his lab, but he was too fatigued to continue. If things were not tense enough with the  change in the Ranma and Rebecca  situation, his great uncle Robert had  paid another visit and seemed to indicate that things should be stepped up,  just incase some people were to try anything against the family.<p>"You're not looking too well," Julie said as she came out of her own  lodgings. She looked at her brother. "I guess you're skipping school  again."</p><p>"It's a school day?" Ned looked at his watch. "Damn, it  is!"</p><p>"Since when did you care? Oh, it's  about your redheaded princess." Julie laughed.</p><p>"She's a princess?" Ned asked, leaning against the wall near his  rooms.</p><p>"That's the rumor. The Terson girl  calls her that, but you know how blondes are," Julie smiled. "Well, I'll see you after school."</p><p>"Yeah, school," the heir to  the Winston empire said as he unlocked his door and stumbled into his room. Thoughts about Ranma would have to wait until  he got some sleep.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"That sounds silly," Gos  smiled as he read the name of his girlfriend's attack<p>"I like the alliteration," Willow said as she flexed her hands, and  looked at the upright log in front of her</p><p>"Try it," Sailor Rose said from the side.</p><p>"Willow Whip!" Sailor Willow shouted. As she flicked her arms  forward, a pair of thin, flexible willow branches seemed to spool out of her  hands and flew towards the log. Once they touched it the branches spun around  ensnaring it in coils. Willow then  clenched her hands and the coils constricted, grinding into the bark and the  softer wood.</p><p>"Useful in capturing things, I'll give you that," Rose nodded.</p><p>"That's only the first part," Willow smiled as she tugged on the  whips, which suddenly erupted in a blue glow.  The branches then spun inward biting into the log. They made steady work  and eventually cut through the large log.</p><p>"A bit slow," Rose appraised.</p><p>"That was just for demonstration," Willow smiled as she dropped the  two lines and summoned another glowing whip.  This one she flung at the target and immediate cut out a large chunk of  the log when it touched it. "It's similar to your purification energy, but  more localized. It only disintegrates  what it's immediately touching," Willow explained as she snapped her wrist  and hit the log again, this time carving a long serpentine cut in it.</p><p>"Imaginative," Rose smiled with approval. "I'll keep this in mind with your  training."</p><p>"I thought you would just have some advanced sensors," Gos shrugged.</p><p>"Well of course I have that." Willow released the energy in her whip  and tried to use it to grab a piece of the log.</p><p>"Yeah, you definitely need more whip practice," Rose nodded. "Though once you master  it... it will be very useful."</p><p>"That's it!" Allison said as  she suddenly appeared behind Gos in a shower of quicksilver.</p><p>"Good, we were waiting for you to show up," Willow winked to Rose.</p><p>"What? Oh... advanced sensors. Damn flower girls, " Allison mumbled.  "I don't care how silly the uniform is.  The perks are worth it. I mean, come on, whips!"</p><p>"You," Sailor Rose said  briefly raising an eyebrow. "You want to be a Sailor Senshi. Okay."</p><p>"I can still use guns and high explosives, right?"</p><p>"I don't see why not," Rose shrugged. "You'll have to wear the  uniform of course, and be a floral Senshi."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah. I don't care," Allison smiled.</p><p>"This could even help cure her quicksilver madness problem," Erika  proposed. Invisibility was a useful  power but not at the risk of insanity.</p><p>Rose nodded. "I think we can work something out. Welcome aboard," the princess smiled.</p><p>"So where's my fuku?"</p><p>"You're going to have to help me get your mind ready, and modify your  existing template. It was easier with  Erika since she's more like me than a normal person, but don't worry. We can get you fighting for love and justice  in no time," Sailor Rose reassured.</p><p>"I think that's a good thing." Allison blinked.</p><p>End Chapter 9</p><p>Special thanks to my  prereaders PyroRaven Patrick Wray, Mondu, and Truk</p><p>As usual they've been a great  help.</p>
