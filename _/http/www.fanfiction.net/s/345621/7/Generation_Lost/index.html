</div><p>Chapter 7 – Weapon of  Choice</p><p>"Who are you?"  Babylon 5, Season 5 Intro.</p><p>Ranma walked down the stairs, muttering to himself.  "Stupid Ned," he said while walking into the den. Dan was already in  the room lounging on one side the couch, his eyes occasionally drifting onto  the glowing box.</p><p>"Hey, Dan. You ready for school?" Ranma asked,  flopping into the other end of the sectional.</p><p>Dan nodded, then rolling over he looked at Ranma with a  ponderous expression.</p><p>"Dude, you should just go to sleep at night," Ranma  stated, looking at his nearly inert cousin.</p><p>"In the abyss of sleep dreams are all we have, that  is their terrible power," Dan mumbled semi-coherently.</p><p>"Right." Ranma simply said. It was far too  early to deal with Dan's special grade of insanity. "Anyway, you think this  new perimeter's going to be okay? We spent half the night putting it in."</p><p>Dan appeared to be in deep thought, as if he were  weighing the pros and cons of several interconnected issues.</p><p>"And what about our hacker? We've got a list, but  who knows if she's on it?"</p><p>Dan nodded, still in deep thought.</p><p>"Well?"</p><p>"Answer me this Ranma. We aren't technically related  are we?"</p><p>"Um what?"  the martial artist asked. Where the hell did that come from?</p><p>"Think about it. I'm Sarah's cousin from her father's  side, and you're her half brother from her mother's side."</p><p>"Point being?"</p><p>"Think about it," Dan said, reaching out to the  coffee table.</p><p>"What do you -" Ranma said just before Dan  tossed the contents of his mug at him. For once it was not coffee but cold tap  water and thus the curse triggered. The Rose Ring appeared and shifted the girl's  clothing, putting her in a green sundress cinched with a rose patterned dark  red belt, light green sandals, her nails were painted in the same green, her  face was then made up in a collection of greens, and finally her vibrant red  hair was unbound to flow freely. "Damn it Dan! What the hell?" she  demanded.</p><p>"I was thinking that as long as we aren't related,  we could... you know…."</p><p>"What the fuck is <i>wrong</i> with you!" Ranma shouted, suddenly very self conscious  as to how she was dressed. "We're both guys!"</p><p>"Not anymore," Dan said after shifting into her  girl-form and a tight black mini-dress.</p><p>Ranma found herself stuck to the couch as the amorous red  eyed girl slid over to her. "What about Allison?" the redhead asked  indignantly, as the other girl got even closer.</p><p>"It was my idea," the blonde girl said from  behind her.</p><p>Ranma screamed as the two girls pounced on her.</p><p>"What the fuck does that mean?" Ranma asked  just after she stopped screaming. She was sitting up in her upper bunk. "Damn!  Of all the dreams I'd have to remember," she muttered, climbing down.  "Stupid ring," she mumbled, looking at her negligee. When she went to  sleep she wasn't wearing a negligee, but then again, when she went to sleep she  was a guy. Resembling a slip, it was comfortable, lacy, pink, accented in  roses, and showed off her figure nicely. All of which, except for the first,  really annoyed her. Mindful of tapping the ring again, she went to her dresser  to find some normal clothes.</p><p>Putting on a pair slacks and a long-sleeved shirt she  left the room looking for her housemates. The upstairs hallway was silent, but  she could hear the soft babble of a distant television. Shrugging, she went  down the stairs. Following the source of the sound brought her to the den where  she came to a disturbingly familiar situation.</p><p>"How're things going princess?" Dan asked as he  slothfully watched television.</p><p>Ranma, who had woken from a rather disturbed dream involving  Dan, said: "I am NOT a princess," rather loudly and forcibly.</p><p>"Mail says otherwise," Dan replied, turning his  attention back to the television.</p><p>"What?" the redhead asked puzzled.</p><p>"It's on the kitchen table. No return address though,"  he added almost as an afterthought.</p><p>"And you just brought it in the house?"</p><p>"Chill Ran-Man, we scanned it. It's clean," Dan  said.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"Some little thing, go and see."</p><p>Ranma shook her head and got up leaving the room,  anything to get away from Dan. Once at the kitchen table, Ranma looked at the  box skeptically. Scattered around it was a collection of junk mail, bills and  letters. The white package was about seven inches long by two inches deep and  wide. All that was on it was postage and the name: Princess Angel Rose.</p><p>Sighing despondently, she tore the ribbon sealing the box  and pulled the lid off. Nestled in a bed of foam was a wand. About six inches  long it was a vibrant green shaft ending in a pure white rose bud set in a gold  base. When she reached out to touch the wand, her ring started to glow. Curious  Ranma noticed that the closer she brought the ring to the wand the brighter it  became.</p><p>Fearful of the repercussions, Ranma pulled back her hand.  "Just fucking great," Ranma muttered as she considered what to do. That  compact might have the sensors to tell here what the wand was, but Ranma did  not want to enter template. Looking at the Rose Ring she got an idea. Holding  her hand open she said the activation phrase, "Rose Compact Activate!"  She could feel a bit of power surge within her as the device formed in her  hand.</p><p>"Gah - why does it always have to be so . . .  girlish," she thought, flipping open the pink and jeweled makeup case. Ranma  pointed it at the object in the box. Ranma looked at the display the Rose Compact  gave off. "White Rose Wand: used for healing and repairing."</p><p>Ranma raised her eyes at this. That doesn't sound too bad.  It wasn't very surprising. Healing was a mainstay of those princess trinkets. Ranma  looked back down at the compact. Even more crap, but at least it might be  somewhat useful crap.</p><p>With her other hand she picked up the wand. Ranma could  feel the power flowing through it. Energy was coming from somewhere inside her  and being focused into the wand. Turning the delicate ivory rosebud to her face  she could feel it building and waiting only to be released, and then Ranma  slipped. She was blinded by a flash of pinkish-white light.</p><p>The White Rose Wand is by no means intelligent, although  confusion would be an adequate description of its current state. The Princess  had activated the wand when it was pointed at herself. Now if she were injured  there would be no issue. The wand would go about trying to heal her.</p><p>However the Princess was in perfect condition, aside from  some minimal brain damage inflicted when she was a rather young age, but that  seemed to be healed and compensated for. Although she was not dressed as one  would expect. So why was it activated? The Princess was fine but horridly  dressed and had activated the Rose Compact and the Rose Ring. The Princess  could have dressed herself properly using the Ring, but did not. The wand,  finding no other injuries, took it upon itself to "fix" its broken  Princess.</p><p>Ranma, fearing whatever what was about to happen, tried  to stop the Wand but could not. She felt her clothes morph and blossom out,  becoming layered and puffed, until they turned into an ornate ball gown. It was  light amethyst and white with rose accents and small sequins sewn into it. The  short and puffy sleeved, dress had bouquets of roses in the center of light green  ribbons that pulled up the folds of the skirts and rested on her shoulders. The  dress' back opened up to allow for her little angel wings to form into place. Her  shoes were then turned into delicate pink pumps.</p><p>Her nails became manicured and polished pink with just a  hint of glitter. A choker formed around her neck, this one patterned in vines  and roses, with a sunflame diamond in the center. It was a clear diamond with  an orange starburst in the center. A purse then formed onto place. It was  circular and purple with sequins. It had a gold clasp with a purple rose etched  on it, and a green strap. A pair of jade and ruby bracelets then appeared.</p><p>A small rose pin formed onto her lapel. Three pairs of  earrings fell into place. The lowest were hanging jeweled roses, the middle was  golden hoops, and the highest were silver studs. Makeup formed into place  including but not limited to, pink lipstick, blush, eyeliner, green eye shadow,  trimmed eyebrows, and elongated eyelashes. A subtle rose perfume then cascaded  around her.</p><p>Then her hair started to move. It was unbraided, then  teased, feathered, and finally was pulled up. Most of her hair was piled on top  of her head where it was sculpted into gentle flip off to one side and to the  back. The rest of her unbound hair consisted of two sections behind either  temple. In a twisted act of irony these were turned into two braids that fell in  front of her ears down to her chest. Her hair was then enriched with pink highlights  and glittering sparkles.</p><p>A simple golden tiara  formed. Unlike the Senshi style which goes on the forehead, hers went on top of  her head, nestled in her frozen hair. Its centerpiece was a mosaic construed  from hundreds of precious stones; naturally into the pattern of a rose. The  Rose Ring only changed slightly by simply gaining a few diamonds around the  setting. The compact on the other hand had transformed completely. In its place  was a circular mirror with a silver frame with a crossed handle coming out of  the bottom of it. Rose and vine patterns were carved into the entirety of the  pristine metal. It was into this crystal clear surface that the redhead saw  what she had become.</p><p>"What the hells was that about?" Dan asked,  coming into the kitchen after hearing a string of expletives that would make a  one eyed carpenter proud. Then he saw the girl. "What the fuck did you do?"  he asked, really starting to question the girl's sanity.</p><p>"I didn't do nothing. The stupid wand in that damn  package of yours turned me into this!" Ranma screamed, still holding the  mirror.</p><p>"What about that package?" Dan asked, concerned  by the angry, intensely dressed girl.</p><p>"Yes, it had this in it," she said gesturing  with her ring-less hand only to find that the wand had disappeared.</p><p>"Um right," Dan said; she's definitely  disturbed. "The reason we took the box inside was because it was empty,"  he said warily. "We thought it was supposed to mess with your head,"  he did not add. Perhaps there was something in the box - some signal that  activated hidden code in Ranma's template. If she lost it, Dan knew roughly  what his chances were, template or no template.</p><p>"You're wrong!   There <i>was</i> something in that  box. And there it is!" she cried, pointing above and to the left of her head  where the wand was hovering.</p><p>The White Rose Wand was again, if not confused, then an  approximation of it. This was not how a Princess was supposed to react,  especially after being restored to her proper attire. Obviously there was still  something wrong with her. Perhaps she needed a nudge in the right direction.</p><p>"I don't see anything," Dan said looking right  at where the wand was.</p><p>"What are you blind? How can you miss something  hanging right in front of you? Are you stupid or just-" and then the wand kicked  in. Her voice softened, becoming sweet, refined, and feminine. "I kindly  suggest that you look again. Hopefully this time you shall see the artifact  that I spoke of," she said finishing with a smile. <i>What the hell?</i> She thought, feeling the unintended words smoothly  roll out of her mouth, which for some reason was beaming demurely. <i>This has to be that fucking wand's doing.</i></p><p>"Are you okay?" Dan asked.</p><p>Looking at her cousin, shock on her face.  <i>I've got  to try to tell him what happened,</i> she thought. Formulating the sentence in  her mind she tried to say it, but as just before she was about to produce the  words they changed, shifting as she said them.</p><p>"No.  Some sort of maladjusted device has  transformed me and is forcing me to talk in a quite unacceptable manner,"  the ball gown wearing beauty said, fighting through her feminine and formal  speech. "I apologize for the inappropriate situation my wand has created,  but it must be remedied," the sparkling, winged redhead said cheerily and  softly despite her best efforts.</p><p>Dan raised an eyebrow. Something was definitely wrong  here.</p><p>Meanwhile the White Rose Wand was increasing its  not-exactly-worry. Despite its efforts the Princess was not acclimating. In  fact, the more the wand helped her, the more she seemed to resist. Something  more drastic had to be done. The wand suspected the Princess was this way  because of that old brain injury; unfortunately it was not authorized to alter  her mind, so the wand prepared to do the next best thing.</p><p>The bejeweled young woman almost smiled on her own. As  long as she could explain what had happened to Dan so she could get fixed,  things might start looking up. "You, kind sir, must help me by finding and  removing this phantom wand," she managed to say before the wand powered up  again.</p><p>With the first action taken by the wand a terrible  femininity was laid over her body. Speaking her mind she tried to fight it, but  soon found the wand forcing her to speak though a girly, delicate, and regal  haze. She could not tell what it had done this time, but it felt proper, it  felt right, and she was terrified of it.</p><p>Seeing that horrid device above her she tried to give it  the finger, as one last message of defiance. However instead of having all but  one of her manicured fingers rolled back into a fist, she found her manicured  hand opening her purse. Her other arm then gently deposited her mirror inside. As  she closed the clasp, she beckoned towards an unnerved Dan. Wanting to tell him  not to freak out and that the wand was doing all this, she tried to speak.</p><p>"I apologize  Guardian Arzish. I appear to have been confused as of late, perhaps a rest is  in order," she said, the horror at her own words and actions in contrast  to the womanly grace she radiated.</p><p>"Guardian? Ranma what's going on?"</p><p>"Have you forgotten my dear Arzish? You are one of  the Guardian's assigned to protect me, The Princess Angel Rose," she  asked, concern evident on her flawless face.</p><p>Dan was about to shift into template when he felt a soft,  dainty hand grasp his. He found himself gently pulled over to her and into a  kneeling position. Looking up into her eyes, he watched as her lips touched the  back of his hand. The elegantly-feminine creature then spoke, "Noble  Guardian you have sacrificed so much, and believe me it will not go unrewarded.  Now stand with pride," she said kissing his other hand.</p><p>Dan stood back up. Ranma had definitely flipped, but at  least she was not violent, for now at least. Dan knowing his delicate position,  chose his words carefully, "Um, yes my princess. Please forgive me."</p><p>Her face brightened. "Always Arzish, always. Oh  silly me! I just put this away." She laughed as she opened her purse. Her  delicate hand then slid the item out. She checked in the Rose Mirror and seemed  satisfied with her happy overly-beautiful face. After returning it to her  purse, she turned to Dan. "Well I am in need of escort," she said,  offering her arm.</p><p>"Where to?" he asked the serene looking young  woman.</p><p>"I'm sorry dear, but you should be properly attired  as well," she said, not wanting to do what she was about to do but having  no choice.</p><p>"Sorry. If you'll let me to go to my room," Dan  said, hoping to get some distance. Then he might be able call the others, maybe  organize something.</p><p>"No need," Princess Angel Rose said, opening  her purse to take out the White Rose Wand. Satisfied that Princess was in a  correct state of mind, the wand compiled with its mistress. Mentally cringing  but outwardly smiling, she watched as glowing energy from her ring and wand  consumed Dan.</p><p>After being shifted into girl-form, her hair grew even  longer, reaching mid-back. Her purple dyed bangs had also lengthened and pulled  back braided by deep red ribbons into the rest of her rich chestnut hair in a  complex and beautiful structure of flowing hair and tight braids. Then her  clothing changed. Fuku, bodysuit, high-heeled boots, ribbons, and white gloves,  all formed. Her skirt was a deep purple. Her ribbons were the same dark red as  her eyes, which were being highlighted by eye shadow and liner, long lashes,  and thin, arched eyebrows. Soft blush formed on her face contrasting with her  deep violet lipstick.</p><p>Jewelry then started to coalesce. Spherical hanging  earrings came into place, glowing like red suns. The gems in her silver tiara  were brilliant faceted gems twinkling like a chevron-shaped constellation. Her  choker was black with an amethyst heart-shaped gem in the center surrounded by  diamonds in a starburst pattern. Finally brightly shining particles, stardust  for lack of a better name rained down onto her sticking on her clothes and hair  sparkling brightly where they landed, completing the girl.</p><p>After she had been put in her girl-form, her clothes had  been replaced by this magical girl gear, and she was in template. Somehow,  someway, this Princess had hacked into Dan's template modifying it so that it  would work in this form, and adding the appropriate costume changes. She was  still a cyborg but she was also a beautifully coiffed cyborg.</p><p>"However, something is amiss," the princess  pondered, looking over the newly transformed girl.</p><p>Dan was too shocked to make an intelligible response, and  simply continued trying to organize her thoughts.</p><p>"That would be the missing element," Princess  Angel Rose said, powering up her wand again. The newly changed girl felt the  back of her fuku open up, followed by the growth of wings. Similar in size and  shape to the Princess' flight wings, these almost reached the floor, giving her  a wingspan close to her total height. Violet, save for the tips which were a  deep crimson, her wings were sprinkled in the same glowing motes that covered  her clothing, hair, jewelry, and makeup.</p><p>"There. Now do you not feel better?" the Princess  inquired happily, her inner shame completely contained.</p><p>"You made me a Senshi?" the purple-highlighted  brunette said, getting the sensations from her new anatomy. "Gods these  things are real. They're a part of me. They've even been integrated into my  wetware," she thought in mute awe and horror.</p><p>"Yes, it would be inappropriate to call you a Guardian  now," she said looking over the transformed girl. "I know,"  Princess Angel Rose exclaimed gleefully, "In battle, I am called Sailor  Rose Angel; you shall be Sailor Nova Angel."</p><p>"Um right Princess, thank you," the newly  christened Sailor Nova Angel, said aware that she was treading a very thin  line. First Ranma transforms herself into this thing, and then she starts  modifying others, all the time ranting about wands, guardians, and other  nonsense. "So where shall we go?" Sailor Nova Angel asked, wondering  if she would need to find her keys.</p><p>Princess Angel Rose considered this. "I believe I  shall meet my sister. How do you think she will receive me?"</p><p>Sailor Nova Angel thought about Sarah and Allison up at  the range practicing handgun. "It will be interesting," she allowed,  running a gloved hand over her hair and twitching her wings. Oh yeah, very  interesting.</p><p>The princess brightened. "I do believe you are quite  right. Well lead on," she said, tugging at Nova's arm</p><p>Sailor Nova Angel nodded and started to take her through  the kitchen. Unlike Ranma, or the girl that seemed to have replaced Ranma, she  had very little experience in heels and walked rather unsteadily. She looked  back to see the beautiful girl enjoying herself. By the time Sailor Nova Angel  had reached the back door she was reasonably sure she would not fall flat on  her face.</p><p>Raising her hand to her face, she said, "My dear  Nova, you are out of sorts." She then stepped through the door and onto  the deck.</p><p>Before taking her  off the porch and up the path, Sailor Nova Angel spoke up, "Won't you be  cold Princess? Surely your gown will get caught on the way up."</p><p>She giggled, the sound like chiming bells. "You do  fuss over me. For is not your dress so much shorter than mine?" she joked  as they walked the path up to the range. "See," she said, deftly  walking on the uneven ground despite her heels and managing to avoid snags in  her extensive dress. Satisfied with her restoration work, Princess Angel Rose  vanished The White Rose Wand, to wait when she needed again.</p><p>"Damn Allison, she had to take the one downstairs,"  Sarah grumbled as she closed the bathroom door. She was walking down the  upstairs hallway when she heard the sounds of sheetrock breaking and mindless  screaming. Shifting into template, she ran to room where the sounds originated.  Easily kicking the door open, the power suit wearing girl scanned the bedroom.</p><p>There was Ranma sitting up in her bed, removing her fist  from the ceiling. Her eyes were focused intently on something far away as she  gibbered to herself. Sarah looked briefly at her HUD, but the display only  showed the energy signals being given off by other redhead. "What  happened?"</p><p>Ranma looked down at the girl a puzzled expression on her  face. "You're in template?"</p><p>"Yeah," Sarah said, adjusting the grip on her  gun.</p><p>"Okay, good then," Ranma said, eyeing the holes  in the ceiling.</p><p>"Was this just a nightmare?" Sarah inquired.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"The cats?"</p><p>"Um, I don't quite remember," Ranma said after  a slight hesitation.</p><p>"What's going on?" Dan's voice asked over Sarah's  headset.</p><p>"Looks like bad dreams," Sarah replied into the  microphone.</p><p>"Scan?" Dan asked.</p><p>"Couldn't hurt," Sarah replied.</p><p>"You got a comm. system working," Ranma  observed.</p><p>"Yeah, we're still testing it though. Although I don't  know if your template will take the code."</p><p>"I'm sure it'll absorb it just fine," Ranma  said, sighing.</p><p>Sarah heard her cousin's voice come in on the encrypted  channel, "Well Dan says the perimeter is secure. That's good."</p><p>"But it was just a dream."</p><p>"Okay then," Sarah said before dropping out of  template. "Look bro, once Allison gets out of the bathroom I suggest you  take a long hot shower," Sara said, noting Ranma's sleep problems.</p><p>Ranma picked up the spoon. After balancing it on his  right index finger, he watched the flatware rock back and forth. The  oscillations increased until the cutlery slipped off his finger. His eyes  tracked the descending object, and when it fell the correct height, he closed  his middle finger to his left thumb. Now holding the spoon at the base where  the handle met the scoop, he pondered it. Half asleep, he looked into the  distorted reflection.</p><p>Sarah looked up from her notebook to see Ranma holding  his utensil in front to his face. His eyes had that faraway yet cognitive look.  The only thing Sarah could equated to it were those 3D pictures, the ones where  your eyes had to be unfocused just right in order to see the shapes emerge from  the static.</p><p>The redhead looked at the others at the table. Her cousin  was more zonked out than her brother, being asleep next to his customary mug of  coffee. Allison was humming a little song to herself while cutting her toast  into small cubes. Sarah put her pencil down next to the unfinished physics problem  and resumed eating her cereal.</p><p>There is an almost gleeful sense of resignation that  happens when one realizes that no matter how hard one tries, no matter the  effort, the assignment can not and will not be completed. It's the sick freedom  and comfort that only comes when you accept failure. It is a sensation  cherished by generations of slackers.</p><p>And this was why Sarah asked her question in an offhand  and cheery voice, despite the early hour.</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma asked while still looking at the  spoon.</p><p>"I said: Are you worried about the problem set that's  due today," Sarah repeated, some of the cheer gone form her voice.</p><p>"Problem set?" Ranma asked, putting his spoon  down.</p><p>"You're almost as bad as Dan."</p><p>"The marmosets are burning though the hull. We have  to get to the freezer before the sparkplugs thaw." Dan mumbled, still  asleep and in the calm ordered voice of someone reading VCR directions.</p><p>"That's nice," Sarah stated as she took her  relative's lunacy in stride. Then to Ranma, "So what's the problem? Still  thinking about that dream?"<br/>"Um nothing, nope."  Ranma said. Looking between the now inaudibly babbling Dan and Allison, who  appeared to be building a standing circle out of bouillon cube sized chunks of  toast, he continued, "Just tired I guess."</p><p>"Well, we've  still got ninety minutes 'til school," she said after looking at the clock  on the microwave.</p><p>"Yeah, but I couldn't get back to sleep," Ranma  said, digging his spoon to the bottom of his still dry cereal and leaving it  buried.</p><p>"See, it's normal," Allison responded, now  carefully forking the cubes into her mouth.</p><p>Sarah glanced at Dan, now quietly listing the virtues of  sandpaper, "Yeah, I really shouldn't be worried about <i>him</i>."</p><p>"Oh, he'll be fine in a half hour or so."</p><p>"Yeah, that's what's unsettling."</p><p>Allison shrugged, and then changed the subject. "So  have you checked the new sensor net again?"</p><p>"Yup, it seems to be up," Sarah stated with a  slight edge, the glee of her slacking now entirely gone.</p><p>"What?" Allison asked, catching the redhead's  tone.</p><p>"She's probably just concerned that Ned gave us the  system just so that he can watch us," Ranma said in a bored tone, while  looking into his spoon now filled with cereal and milk.</p><p>"Yeah, but why don't you care? I mean you were  hostile to him during the night's setup." Allison asked</p><p>"Just a bit angry that he was checking out my girl  form when we were in the truck," Ranma replied a little too evenly.</p><p>Sarah caught the odd tone and paused, thinking over his  statement.</p><p>"Well, you can't blame Winston for it. You were in a  rather interesting dress, and all he did was scope you out. Perfectly normal,"  Allison countered, forking up the last of her toast.</p><p>"I shouldn't be having this conversation. I'm a guy."  Ranma grumbled, only slightly perturbed, Sarah noticed.</p><p>"Ned doesn't know that," Allison said, getting  up.</p><p>"I guess he's never seen me as a guy; has he?"  Ranma asked his sister.</p><p>Sarah looked up from the textbook she was vacillating  over, "Nope. I don't think so," then after a sigh. "I guess I could  get back to work. If I do a few more problems, then I might not fail."</p><p>"What's this I'm hearing?" Allison asked after  washing her dishes. "Since when did you start caring about that stuff?"</p><p>"I'm not a degenerate, like the rest of you,"  Sarah stated.</p><p>"Slacker you are a," Dan muttered, finally  saying something halfway coherent.</p><p>"Looks like he's waking up. Darn. I was sure that  after last night, he'd sleep till noon."</p><p>"We weren't up <i>that</i>  late putting in the sensor net," Sarah defended before realization dawned.  "Oh god," she then stated with slight disgust.</p><p>"I don't even want to know," Ranma said,  focusing on eating his breakfast.</p><p>"What?" Allison asked. "We're two healthy  consenting-"</p><p>Sarah cut her of, "That's not it."</p><p>"Oh, is it the bi thing?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Then what?"</p><p>"That you used his body just so that you could drive  today," Sarah said.</p><p>"Well, that was a fringe benefit," Allison  admitted, "But that wasn't the only reason."</p><p>"How do they get grain to glow in the dark?"  Ranma noted.</p><p>"Come on Ran-Man, Allison's talked about sex before."  Dan said sitting up, sipping his coffee.</p><p>"What the? When'd you get up?" Sarah noted with  surprise.</p><p>Dan shrugged.</p><p>"So I'm not driving today?" Allison asked.</p><p>"Nope," Dan said, calmly taking another sip of  the now tepid beverage. "But I do appreciate last night."</p><p>Sarah suddenly got up and dropped her dish in the sink.</p><p>"Where're you going?" Allison asked, leaning on  the counter.</p><p>Sarah had picked up her notes and textbook, "I'm  going to try and finish the problem set."</p><p>"Why?" Dan asked, finally draining his mug.</p><p>Sarah paused at the entryway to the kitchen, "To rid  some guilt," she replied honestly, going into the den</p><p>"Okay then," Dan said, saluting with his mug,  walking over to the coffee machine.</p><p>"I should get going too," Allison said, leaving  the room.</p><p>"So," Dan said, getting back to his seat.</p><p>"Yup," Ranma said, resuming his meal.</p><p>Dan took a long pull from his refilled cup. "Ahh  congealing."</p><p>Ranma looked at the mug. It was a simple ceramic mug,  glazed dark blue. On the surface was an intricate grey inverted V, a gate  chevron, and inside that were the letters SGC. "You get that from the show's  website?"<br/>"Something like that,"  Dan said, taking another sip.</p><p>"I know you're trying to bait me into asking about  how you got that mug."</p><p>Dan simply shrugged.</p><p>"Sometimes I wonder how much that blonde has warped  you," Ranma said, just before he mentally connected the dots.</p><p>Dan watched as the other teen's face darkened slightly.</p><p>"So. You've had sex as a girl?" Ranma asked, a  bit more slightly unnerved.</p><p>"Well, it was with Allison, so technically."  Dan paused considering the technicalities of the issue. "Sure. I guess I  did."</p><p>"But why?"</p><p>"What? Both forms have their pros and cons,"  Dan stated in a voice that would normally be used to decide between two brands  of shaving cream: the Gillette cream goes on smoother while the Pro-Edge shaves  closer.</p><p>Ranma  blinked, and then slowly, deliberately rammed his head into the table.</p><p>"To tell you the truth I had a similar reaction at  first, but you get used to it," Dan said before taking another sip of  coffee.</p><p>Opening the back door, Ranma looked up the mountain. For  Wyoming, it was a smallish hill, but that's for Wyoming. "Damn," he  muttered, noticing the flag fluttering at the top of the pole. The observation  was punctuated by a rifle shot cracking down the slope.</p><p>"Amazing," Ranma thought as he walked up the  path, relatively at ease to the gunfire. No danger sense, no sounds of  commotion, just someone practicing before school. Something that he was  planning to do.</p><p>Reaching the leveled ground of the range, Ranma turned to  see Allison lying on the ground. Cradled by her shoulder and arms was a  powerful looking rifle. Running along the top of it was a largish scope. Ranma  watched as the blonde lined her sight up to the scope, gently swiveled the gun  into position, curled her index finger so that it was just over the trigger,  calculated for wind and bullet drop, confirmed her target, flipped off the  safety, then holding her breath and stabilizing the weapon perfectly, she  applied a gentle consistent pressure to that flange of metal.</p><p>As it released its projectile, the gun bucked up  slightly. The girl brought it back down, and then worked the bolt. After  twisting the lever attached to the side of the bolt, she pulled it back,  releasing the spent brass. She then slammed the bolt back home, the mechanism  picked up another cartridge from the magazine, rammed it up the feeder ramp,  and into the breach. Twisting the bolt back again, secured the chamber, seated  the bullet and cycled the action.</p><p>The blonde repeated her sighting process and fired  another round.</p><p>Ranma would never understand weapons users, especially  those who preferred firearms. He could give the devices an extremely begrudging  respect. Granted, there was something to the smooth cold precision to them, the  sense of power, and ultimately, responsibility, but still. They seemed a cheap,  cowardly way out. A shortcut to gain power and range. Something that was very  far from the Art.</p><p>When he told Sarah that, the girl cocked her head to the  side and laughed slightly. She agreed completely. For her, Dan, and the others,  fighting had no spiritual side, no grace, and no beauty. It was ugly, dirty,  hateful work.</p><p>When you pulled that trigger at someone, it would do  significant damage. A skilled person could prevent lethal shots, but even a  wound to the extremities would shatter bone, tear muscle, destroying flesh. There  was no way around it. The shot you fired could not be pulled back and the  consequences must be accepted.</p><p>This formed a vastly different approach to combat than  Ranma was used to. In Nerima a fight could break out, and while there would be  massive property damage and people would get hurt, they'd be fine in a few  days. There was no permanence to it. As maddening as the fights were, they were  mostly harmless. The Art centered on using just enough power as the situation  warranted.</p><p>Here things were a bit different. Ranma remembered when  Ned sniped that mech, fully intent on killing the pilot. He didn't know that it  was remotely operated and accepted the very likely possibility that he would  end a life. But that was the mentality here, you did what was necessary to  survive combat, and if that meant killing the enemy, then oh well, they shouldn't  have attacked you in the first place.</p><p>Only the hacker bitch's unwillingness to show herself or  employ human lackeys prevented someone from being killed.</p><p>He then remembered something that Sarah had told him.  " 'God may have created man, but Samuel Colt made them equal.' Maybe that's  why people don't like guns. It makes a level playing field. That's the problem  with equalizers; many are not satisfied with being 'equal.' "Sarah had  gone on, but that was the only part that had stuck in his mind. The rest of  what his sister said boiled down into that venerable quote from Ben Parker:  With great power comes great responsibility.</p><p>And what if guns allowed the irresponsible to get power  quickly and easily? Should the responsible and law abiding be punished because  of the deeds of others? Should the rights of all be restricted due to the  actions of criminals and incompetents, and if so, how much?</p><p>Ranma had no idea as to the answers of these questions,  but he had seen the argument from the other side. He knew people who had given  the majority of their life to, or spent the majority of their life at arts, and  for what? To make a mockery of the Art. To use their skills to steal, cheat,  and bully. Years of skill and technique squandered on petty rivalries.</p><p>Honor  seemed to be less dependent on the weapon than on the individual; it relied  more on how one fought and for what one fought than the weapon used.</p><p>Allison had fired her last round. She dropped the empty  clip into her hand, and looked over her shoulder to see the standing teen. "Hey  Ran-Man, I'm about done now."</p><p>Ranma raised his eyebrow, "I thought only Dan called  me that?"</p><p>Allison shrugged as she got up and went downrange to  retrieve her targets.</p><p>"Nice," Ranma remarked when she got back.</p><p>"Not really, some of my shots strayed out of the X  ring," Allison remarked, pointing to the few ragged holes that were not  quite entirely inside the innermost circle.</p><p>Ranma looked at the embankment where Allison had taken  her targets from, at the far end of the range easily over two hundred yards. Skill  and control are not the exclusive domain of martial arts. A gun is just that, a  tool. A rather powerful tool, one that could kill, but so could anything else,  really. And like any tool, especially those that are weapons as well, firearms  require a certain amount of skill, respect, responsibility, and even reverence  to be used to their full potential.</p><p>Ranma glanced at the complex, yet elegantly simple  machine. It wasn't something that he would truly understand or love, and truth  be told, still loathed. But from the perspective of one professional to  another, he could respect the people who used them, if not the devices  themselves.</p><p>"All yours" - Allison said. She disassembled  her gun and placed the parts into their carrying case. She then handed him a  small handheld computer. On its screen was the incoming feed from the sensor  net. The display was clear of echoes. Allison knelt down to retrieve her brass,  pocketing the spent casings. Undoubtedly being saved so they can be used again  to make new rounds.</p><p>"Right," Ranma said, eyeing the now open range.  It was amazing how a few words could turn a no man's land into a simple field.  He watched the blonde pick up her gun case and walk down the path back to the  house.</p><p>Ranma looked at the small palm-pilot. Using the touch  pad, he set it so that it would set off an alarm if the sensor net detected  something… out of place. He pocketed the computer, still wary of trusting  such a mechanism.</p><p>Falling into a familiar stance, Ranma allowed his body to  execute a set of moves, before falling into another block of commands.</p><p>Balance, control, technique.</p><p>Ranma's mind cleared, concentrating only on the flawless  performance of muscle and bone, body, and mind. Like an MP3 ripper thumbing through  his play lists, or a book collector walking his stacks, or a wine taster  sampling his finest vintages, Ranma scrolled though his own collection,  reacquainting himself with old moves and past fights. Then using these past  elements as a baseline, he expanded out, recombining, innovating, creating.</p><p>Optimization, improvisation, planning.</p><p>After a minute or so, an errant thought entered his mind.  "I really shouldn't have lied to Sarah at breakfast." Ranma allowed  this thought to roll in his mind while he queued up another kata.</p><p>"I didn't lie to her," he added.</p><p>"Yes I did," Ranma thought next in his curious  little monologue.</p><p>"Nope, I did have problems sleeping."</p><p>"And it had nothing to do with the fact that I was  sleeping as a girl?"</p><p>"But  I was a guy when I went to bed."</p><p>"Yup. Really should have told them about that."</p><p>"Nah, it's just the curse."</p><p>"And what about the negligee?"</p><p>"It's just that damn ring I now have in my  girl-form."</p><p>"And nothing about the dreams."</p><p>"What dreams?" Ranma thought, but there he hit  a dead end. The martial artist knew that he dreamed, but rarely could he  remember them in the morning. It was only those few that unnerved him that  stuck into his mind, like that one about Kuno, or the one with the pit filled  with glowing, hungry eyes.</p><p>The reminder of the neko-ken almost made him pause, but  Ranma was in mid-flip. It wasn't until he made the landing that he stopped. Ranma  pushed those thoughts aside, or tried to. Even when it's locked away in a far  off corner of his mind, the 'training' still left its taint, a sickly sweet  trail of madness. It was another part of the legacy of Genma.</p><p>Still standing, Ranma tried to concentrate on something  else. It was common knowledge that purposely trying <i>not</i> to think of something was one of the surest ways of getting it  stuck in your mind, so Ranma tried to think about other things.</p><p>Anything to keep his mind off the dark and the yellow  eyes. No stop that. Think of something else, anything else.</p><p>Cereal. Yes, that will do the trick. Nice crunchy cereal.  Wholesome grains supersaturated with sugars, dyes, and luminescent filaments. "Damn,  dead idiot," Ranma muttered, mentally cataloging his breakfast: Chocolate  Frosted Sugar Bombs special glow in the dark version, milk, two percent, pulpy  orange juice, well not that pulpy, a little but not too much…</p><p>That was it: nice, dry, dull, mind-filling nonsense.  "What else," Ranma thought when his forced interest began to wane. "Hey,  I used a bowl too, a glass and a spoon. Spoons, they're funny things,"  Ranma silently monologue while visualizing the mirrored flatware.</p><p>"Huh, why'd I take note of that? I mean yeah, spoons  are shiny. So what?" his train of thought continued.</p><p>"The spoon does nothing, save distort reflections."</p><p>"Great. I'm getting weird again. Oh well, beats the  alternative."</p><p>"Then again, all reflections are distortions of  reality."</p><p>"Yes, very nice. Good to have a distracting train of  thought."</p><p>"That's why the spoon was so disturbing; it was a  reminder of earlier in the morning."</p><p>"What, I had woken up and went to the bathroom and  then… Oh crap."</p><p>"Oh crap indeed."</p><p>"I was girl. Didn't go to sleep as one, and I didn't  notice that I was one"</p><p>"That wasn't what set me off."</p><p>"What then" Ranma asked, only to be met with mental  silence.</p><p>"At least that got my mind off of those things,"  Ranma thought resuming, losing himself in the Art.</p><p>Allison stood at the back door to the house holding the  field glasses that she kept in her gun case. She pulled them out after seeing  some movement from the range. Considering the small glen of trees that sat  between the house and the terraced land, that she even noticed Ranma was  noteworthy. It was just a glimpse something she caught out of the corner of her  eye</p><p>She  had turned, having some idea of what to expect, but still awed and more than a  little jealous.</p><p>"Perhaps awe is a bit weak," Allison thought as  she watched the martial artist. "Amazed may be more appropriate,"  Allison appended. "He's more powerful than most templates right now. No,  not quite power, more of skill and control." Allison could have dwelt on  the sheer wonderment of these feats, but that was less interesting than how  Ranma became this way, and how being like this affected him.</p><p>Here was someone with dedication, someone who'd spent their  whole life working to obtain one goal. Well Ranma was not that single-minded,  but he was close. Her eyes, while being rather sharp, could not quite range the  distance. She had then opened her gun case to get out the small pair of  binoculars kept there.</p><p>Putting them to her eyes, she had watched him, observing  the blurred movements; this was someone with complete, perhaps obsessive,  dedication. If he chose to, Ranma could, within a matter of days, match and  surpass weapons skills that she had spent years on.</p><p>Allison added pity  to the mix of emotions, something that she rarely felt, for this focus came  with a price. Ranma's life seemed to be a string of other people's mistakes, as  if he was the receptacle the universe used to dump the remainder of its chaos. Even  here where Ranma had reasonably stable home life and family that he could count  on, he was plagued by outside circumstance.</p><p>He was different, alien, special, and unique. Even in a  place like Lockridge, he was something else. If Ranma ever embraced that cursed  template of his, what <i>she</i> could do  would be terrible and beautiful.</p><p>Allison knew that her jealousy was normal. To not be  moved by that teen's symphony of flesh would be a dangerous denial of reality.  The blonde knew she had her own things that made her unique, the quicksilver  gland, her mechanical and computer skills, Dan, but more importantly was  Allison's drive to not be petty. She knew what that kind of insecurity did to  people.</p><p>Watching Ranma, she noticed something sad about the scene.  He was practicing in a blank field. It looked artificial, imposed, like  watching a bear in a cage. Allison knew that Ranma normally practiced somewhere  out in the vast forested hills that extended around the house, but now with the  sensor net and the knowledge that they were being watched, Ranma was  restricted.</p><p>No one told him that he had to practice there today, just  like no one told him he had to sleep as a girl while in his sister's room. To  Allison, these seemed to be the result of him being Japanese. A sense of  obligation or burden to politeness; nothing too large, no formalities in his speech  (but that could be due to the issue of language) no overt politeness, just  little things. Allison believed that Sarah said it best: Man, Nerima sure did a  mind job on you.</p><p>Or perhaps Ranma felt guilty that people he's known for  less than a month were willing to fight for him, and that his presence had  gotten them hurt. Allison knew that to be false, their hacker bitch had been  messing with their files for some time now. Ranma may have been a catalyst to  these events, but that hardly placed him at fault. As for helping him, that's  what you do for family. Ranma was her boyfriend's cousin, and that was that.</p><p>Then something odd happened, Ranma stopped. Allison  watched him stand there, his mouth closed his face guarded, but still the  blonde had the nagging sensation that he was in a conversation, or maybe having  a little monologue. She had seen people space out like this before, but not  Ranma. "Well, this could be a normal part of his training regiment,"  Allison thought, refocusing her binoculars.</p><p>"And what are you doing?" Sarah asked through  the ajar doorway.</p><p>"Just watching Ranma." Allison said slightly  startled at the redhead's sudden appearance. "I thought you were studying,"  the blonde stated, letting the binoculars rest on the strap that she had fed  around her neck</p><p>"I gave up." Sarah said, coming out onto the  back porch.</p><p>"Good for you."</p><p>Sarah made a grab for the binoculars, the blonde choking  as she was pulled in close. "If I didn't already know you were like this,  I'd be unsettled," Sarah said, looking at her sibling.</p><p>Allison wrenched the magnifying device out of the other  girl's hands. 'What? It's not like I'm related to him."</p><p>"Her," Sarah said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>"Huh," Allison said, sure enough the pigtailed  teen had resumed practicing, this time possessing red hair. The blonde then  focused in on Ranma. "Well at least she's got the sense to wear a bra now."</p><p>"I will not have you corrupt my entire family,"  Sarah remarked, mostly joking. "And besides, you know that Ranma's like  that because of that stupid ring."</p><p>"You know as much as she does what it's like with  those things," Allison remarked ignoring one redhead and intently watching  the other.</p><p>"I'm not going to let you draw me into an argument  about breasts."</p><p>"Aw. Why not? They are very fun."</p><p>Sarah looked at the maddeningly jovial expression on the  other girl's face. Her eye twitched slightly. "No. No. Not going to. Just  walk away O'Neil." Sarah muttered, retreating back into the house.</p><p>Allison smirked, sometimes it was so easy.</p><p>Dan was working in the garage. The hood to the beast was  open. A collection of cables of various sizes ran from the guts of the machine  into a laptop balanced over the coolant reservoir. Sitting on the nicely warm  manifold was the pot of coffee from breakfast.</p><p>Whistling a little tune that would have made Jhonen  Vasquez shudder and H.P. Lovecraft crave the sweet release of opium, (that is  until, Cthulhu's big buddy realized that he should really stop pining after  Poe) Dan fiddled with his machines. After all, just because a deranged cyborg  was happily working on a vehicle made to look like Chevy had a factory on Z'Ha'Dum,  or at least hired out certain <i>associates</i>  to consult the design, was no reason to be concerned. The squirming black  paint, the refurbished helicopter engine, the various upgrades, these were  eccentric but mostly harmless.</p><p>However the device that bore a strong resemblance to a  piece of artillery was another matter. It sat in the bay next to the truck and  looked to be a cross between a heavy machine gun and small cannon. Indeed, the  two parallel barrels, the elevated frame had seemed to confirm this assessment.</p><p>Idle thoughts passed through Dan's mind as he worked  between the truck, computer, largish weapon, and the various tool chests.  "I like pants. Doom! What this thing needs is a decent fire control  computer. Ohio will pay for its impudence. No we need more power in the drive  train. Doom? My boobs itch. Okay this bolt isn't metric or US customary. What  the hell? We don't have breasts. Use a vice grip. Sometimes we do. Someone  entered the room. Be quiet about those damn pants, what we need is a fish  magnet. Those don't exist. So it's just Ran-Man. Need Caffeine. Allison may be  trying to kill me. So? She's hot. I still say we should put in wire guidance. Mmmm  manifold brewed. She's looking at us funny. There is NO us. So <i>you</i> say."</p><p>At first Ranma was amused when she entered the workshop. She  watched the older teen, sans his ubiquitous trench coat, scuttle around the  room quietly muttering to himself. It was after Dan looked up and said  something about fish or magnets and then returned to work that Ranma grew  concerned.</p><p>After shouting his name a few times, Ranma finally got  Dan to look up. The response was pleasantly coherent.</p><p>"Oh sorry, I just kinda zoned out," Dan said  before he noticed exactly what Ranma was wearing. It was bit unusual, but not  much.</p><p>"No problem," Ranma said, knowing all to well  what that was like. "It was bad enough when Earth Force adapted shadow  tech, but at least they used it in space ships," Ranma observed, looking  at the truck</p><p>"Ahh so you've watched some B5 after all," Dan  said amused.</p><p>"A little," Ranma admitted.</p><p>"So what can I do for you?" Dan said, cleaning  his hands with Permatex Fast Orange fine pumice hand cleaner.</p><p>"We don't  have to leave for ten minutes or so."</p><p>"Well things haven't exactly been going well lately,"  Ranma said.</p><p>"Ran-Man, it's me Dan. You can trust me," he  said, making his eyes glow slightly.</p><p>"Um right. Have you had any strange things happening  with your curse?"</p><p>"Well there, was this one time after Allison has  just put her-"</p><p>"Stop," Ranma sternly said. "Anything  else?"</p><p>"Well, in a few weeks there may be some natural  degradation."</p><p>"Degradation?"</p><p>"Unlike your curse, mine's a copy, and since Calash  really can't decode the curse, it's not perfect. That and non-Calash magic's  always been fluky here."</p><p>"Oh, so it's falling apart?" Ranma said, not at  all relieved on that prospect. Without the curse, she could not turn back into  a guy, though this did help explain some of the problems with her curse.</p><p>"Yeah, but I can just reinstall it."</p><p>"Ahh, well that's good," Ranma said, knowing  that the same could be done for her. "So aside from that, you've got  nothing weird with you?"</p><p>"Nope," Dan said, gathering and putting away  his tools. "What's going on? You still upset that I'm using the curse like  this?"</p><p>"Well, a little bit. It's just that for a while, my  curse and the template's been acting off."</p><p>"Ahh. That ring? Don't worry, sometimes templates  have leakage into the host's mundane form. Allison's still got the quicksilver  gland in her head, and I have a couple of things. Undoubtedly you've got access  to some of your stuff. It makes sense. Often times magical girls can use  certain powers untransformed."</p><p>"I am not a magical girl," Ranma said despite  the little rose ring and the matching theme in her wardrobe.</p><p>"Yes you are." Dan replied gleefully. "But  hey so, are Sarah and Allison."</p><p>Ranma looked at Dan sighing. "Are you gonna listen  to what I'm saying?"</p><p>"Um okay," Dan said, just a little distracted.</p><p>"You know how I was a bit out of it at breakfast?"</p><p>"Nope." Dan replied cheerfully.</p><p>"Oh yeah. Well that's not the point; I was out  practicing later, and, as you can see, changed."</p><p>Dan had cleared the engine compartment of foreign parts  and was about to close the hood "So? Seems reasonable enough to train in  both forms." Dan said trying not to notice the little shorts and tight,  rose print, tee that the redhead was wearing. He wasn't doing too badly; she  did look like his cousin. Well maybe not identical, but rather close. That  helped a lot, and in Dan's defense, Ranma was a rather stretchy girl.</p><p>"That's not it," Ranma said ignoring Dan. "Damn,  I should have changed back before I came to talk to him," she thought  before entertaining the thought of telling Allison what Dan was doing. On the  one hand, she might punish Dan, but on the other hand, the neurotic blonde  might be into it. Ranma remembered seeing Allison try to hide those binoculars  and shuddered.</p><p>In the end, she decided not to, recalling exactly how  Allison punished her boyfriend. Back in Nerima there were girls after him and  there were people after his girl side, but there weren't any girls after his  girl side, well there was that one time. "Dan! Look up here," Ranma  said, snapping her fingers.</p><p>"Sorry," Dan replied sheepishly. "Hell of  a time to forget my sunglasses," he muttered under his breath.</p><p>Ranma let the remark slide and continued. "The  problem is that I didn't know I'd changed until I was done."</p><p>"So? That's happened to me," Dan said  nonchalantly as he closed the hood.</p><p>Ranma paused, glaring at the darkly dressed teen.</p><p>"Oh yeah, you don't want to hear any of <i>those</i> stories."</p><p>"Why do I even try talking to you?" Ranma said,  rubbing her temples. Then noticing Dan's slight amusement she continued, "Anyway  the problem is that it doesn't feel like a problem. I mean I unconsciously turn  into a girl, and don't notice it until my top gets tangled in my bra, and the  worst part is that it doesn't feel wrong or twisted."</p><p>"Well it did feel tang-" Dan started.</p><p>"No, no puns," Ranma said, cutting him off,  realizing what she'd just said.</p><p>"Okay then," Dan said before responding to the  topic at hand.   "So you're getting  used to the curse?"</p><p>"No! That's the problem. It should be driving me  crazy but it isn't!"</p><p>"Yes it is." Dan said flatly.</p><p>"No, the fact that I'm <i>not</i> going crazy from all this crap with curse and template is  making me nuts."</p><p>"Stop analyzing this shit. Okay?" Dan said  calmly. "See this?" he said holding up his left arm. Midway between  the wrist and elbow of the limb was a long, thin scar that encircled the arm in  an oblique slant.</p><p>"Didn't that happen in your template?"</p><p>"Yes, but remember your temp isn't some separate  entity. It is a part of you," Dan stated, picking up his coat.</p><p>"Point being?"</p><p>"Just that," Dan said, slipping the black trench  on. With his black boots, pants, and shirt, all that was missing were those  dark sunglasses.</p><p>"So you're saying that since the template's a part  of me, the weird shit it pulls wouldn't make me feel all unsettled," Ranma  said skeptically</p><p>"Um sure. Why not?" Dan stated, taking a pull  at the coffee pot.</p><p>"But that's the exact sort of thing that should  freak me out!" Ranma exclaimed.</p><p>"So you're freaking out at not freaking out. Same  result."</p><p>"No, this thing's," Ranma said, holding up her  ring, "pulling all this shit with me, and you say it's going to feel <i>normal</i> to me."</p><p>"Yeah, that's about it."</p><p>"If it wasn't already happening to me..." Ranma  trailed off, not wanting to complete the thought.</p><p>"I know," Dan admitted, understanding the  implication. "But at least you're not going around like a ditzy magical  girl."</p><p>"Yet," Ranma glumly appended.</p><p>Dan shrugged noncommittally.</p><p>"I'm real glad we had this little talk," Ranma  said sarcastically before leaving the garage.</p><p>"Me too," Dan said solemnly once Ranma had  left.</p><p>"Now why are we going to school today?" Ranma  asked from the back seat.</p><p>"Well, we do have a problem set due in physics  class." Sarah said.</p><p>"Huh? I thought we were in chemistry class?"</p><p>"We've got both this semester."</p><p>"That explains why my notes don't make any sense,"  Ranma said with some slight relief.</p><p>"You still take notes?" Allison remarked from  her customary front seat.</p><p>"Why do I even try?" Sarah stated.</p><p>"Hey Ran-Man, you've got mail," Dan remarked as  he flipped through the contents of their mailbox.</p><p>Allison's face darkened, "Never, <i>ever</i>, say <b>that </b>phrase again." The blonde held out her hand to Dan, the  quicksilver beginning to drip off the nails.</p><p>"Um okay," Dan said, chastising himself for the  slip-up. Allison had no problem with incantations or sacrifices to mad gods,  but make one comment about a certain company… "I was just saying  that Ran-Man's got some mail."</p><p>"What?" Ranma asked, concern on his face. For  some reason the prospect of getting mail disturbed him greatly.</p><p>"Well, that's great. Is it some statement of  challenge, or whatever the hell those knuckleheads in Nerima do?" Sarah  inquired.</p><p>"It could be from our hacker bitch. She seems like  the type to get the kick out of taunting us through snail-mail," Allison  suggested.</p><p>"Oh, it's worse than that," Dan remarked,  handing over the letter.</p><p>Ranma skimmed the symbols on the envelope, with growing  relief, "So what? It's just a credit card application."</p><p>"Don't  you see?" Allison said, turning to face Ranma her eyes enclosed in silver.</p><p>"It knows you are here.  It <b>knows</b> <b>your</b> <b>name,"</b> she said in a charged voice.</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow at the blonde's theatrics before  tearing the junk mail in half.</p><p>"Oh very nice," Sarah said clapping her hands. "But  Lita was a redhead wasn't she? Oh, and her eyes turned black."</p><p>"Actually," Allison said dissipating the  quicksilver. "It was Ivanova who said that one."</p><p>"Oh. Sorry then."</p><p>"This does raise the question of how this company  found me." Ranma said.</p><p>"Not really. Hell, my cousin once got one of those  addressed to his dog." Allison remarked.</p><p>"Hmm. Was that the one with the glass eye, or the  one in the asylum?" Dan asked, returning to the pile of mail.</p><p>"No, it was Bill."</p><p>"Ahh, he writes for 'Soldier of Fortune' doesn't he?"</p><p>"That's the one."</p><p>"Huh? I didn't expect them to get this out that  fast," Dan said.</p><p>"Oh, your card came?" Allison asked.</p><p>"Yup," Dan said, handing over the solid looking  envelope.</p><p>Allison tore into the envelope, withdrawing a small  laminated card. "Man, there's no such thing as a good driver's license  photo," the blonde remarked at the little photo.</p><p>"My bangs didn't even line up evenly," Dan  noted while looking at the ID card.</p><p>"Bangs?" Ranma asked, looking at Dan's hair. It  was buzzed short and flat, to fit with the rest of his 'deranged in black' look.  The only time Dan's even had bangs was… and then Ranma figured it out. "You  got a fake diver's license for your girl-form? Why?"</p><p>"Oh, it's quite real," Dan said, taking the  envelope and card from Allison's hands and handing it over to Ranma.</p><p>The quasi-legal alien looked at the letter. It was  addressed to: Dianna Arzish / 137 Wyrm Rd / Lockridge, WY 82336<b>, </b>and had the return address of Sweetwater  County Clerk's Office / 80 West Flaming Gorge Way /P.O. Box 730 / Green River,  WY 82935. The card that came with it looked like a legitimate Wyoming state  driver's license, or at least it matched the other one that Dan currently  carried, and the picture was of a certain red eyed girl.</p><p>"Erika told us how to do it," Allison said,  fiddling with the truck's radio.</p><p>"Well that makes sense. She had to create an  identity for herself somehow."</p><p>"And Gos does like to infiltrate government systems."</p><p>"Yup. Once you know where the holes are in the  system, it's fairly easy to put in what you need."</p><p>"And then you got them to send you a replacement  license," Sarah said.</p><p>"Yup. I just mailed them some laminated paper  fragments, and said the original caught fire," Dan smirked, pleased with  himself.</p><p>"It does help that the paper pushers over in Green  River aren't too anal," Allison added, still messing with the radio's  buttons.</p><p>"Still, why'd you do this?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"What?" Dan asked, putting the documentation in  one of his coat's pockets.</p><p>"Okay, let me try it a bit more direct. Why did you  make a false identity for your girl-form?"</p><p>"You can never have too many aliases," he said  while putting the rest of the mail in the console between the front seats. Dan  then put the vehicle in gear, pulling away from the mailbox and turning out of  the driveway.</p><p>"That almost answered my question."</p><p>"Glad to be of help." Then turning to Allison, "What  are you doing? It's just the radio. If you want to mess with something, the  guidance systems are right next to it."</p><p>"I'm just setting the presets so I won't miss my  show," Allison said.</p><p>"Ahh talk radio, the <i>easy</i> way for fanatics to spread their word," Dan said.</p><p>"He's not a  religious nut," Allison said.</p><p>"He likened  Starfox to Jesus,"</p><p>"Actually it  was Nintendo."</p><p>"I do not  think the cube is the product of divine intervention.</p><p>"Oh, but you  do believe that the X-Box is conjured from the depths of Hell."</p><p>"Well, it is just common sense," Dan replied.</p><p>"Do I want to know?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Honestly no," Sarah answered, slightly  exasperated</p><p>"It doesn't  seem <i>that</i> bad," Ranma said,  looking at the couple in the front two seats.</p><p>"Okay, fine then. Allison listens to this radio  show, called 'Saved Games with Father Ward.' It's okay, but she really likes it.  Dan, however, can't stand it."</p><p>"Oh," Ranma said, mulling over the fact. "So  Allison likes Christian themed gaming advice?" Ranma said only with slight  skepticism. Gamers as a whole seemed to be rather eccentric.</p><p>"That's about right."</p><p>"Why wouldn't Dan like that? He's all reverent about  l33tness" Ranma said, that word feeling especially odd on his tongue.</p><p>"That's the problem. Dan thinks that a Christian  gaming philosophy is too aloof and rigid, while Allison professes that a l33t  philosophy is indulgent and hedonistic."</p><p>"They disagree on gaming theology?" Ranma asked,  confused that there was such a thing.</p><p>"Well only on some of the finer points of  interoperation. They both think that gaming is a very spiritual experience."</p><p>"This is insane," Ranma declared, looking out  the window. "These are just games we're talking about."</p><p>Sarah's face darkened a bit, "You're technically  right. The game itself is nothing. It is only until a person uses it as a  conduit that it achieves purpose."</p><p>"Oh-kay" Ranma backpedaled, "I was just  surprised that Allison would dislike anything indulgent."</p><p>Sarah smiled, despite herself. "You're fairly good  at side-stepping issues aren't you?"</p><p>"Come on Ranma, you don't think I'm just some  perverted sociopath who does whatever she damn well pleases?" Allison  asked, switching conversations.</p><p>"It's just that you're not into l33t. I thought all  you gamers were into that stuff."</p><p>Allison laughed. It was a strangely unpleasant sound.  "Yes, I should accept the debased speech used by a pack of inept fools,  punks, and losers."</p><p>"The great fault of l33t is that it possesses many  false prophets and unworthy adherents, but those who are true to the path shall  triumph."</p><p>"Then why don't you believe?" Allison asked.</p><p>"Just listen to your show, okay?" Dan said,  concentrating on his driving.</p><p>Ranma looked curiously at Sarah, who simply shook her  head.</p><p>"This  is why we came to school today," Dan said, pointing to the screen.</p><p>Ranma looked at the spreadsheet. It  contained a list of names, aliases, physical features, skill levels, short  bios, and other information. A significant fraction of the largish cells were  blank. The first row was especially sparse. All it contained was a rather  unflattering alias, a gender, a list of hacked systems and stolen files, and an  estimate on skill level.</p><p>"This is all we have on her?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Well, she somehow managed to  get within range to imprint you that day." Dan said, adding that data.</p><p>"And now you compare her data  to the list you've made," Ranma supposed.</p><p>"Yup," Dan agreed, pulling  up another list, "These are the Lockridge girls who could have pulled it  off."</p><p>"Berkley, Carter, Langley,  Norfolk, O'Neil, Stevens, and Terson," Ranma read off the screen. "O'Neil?  Terson?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Allison looked at Sarah, "Well,  we are fairly good."</p><p>"I'm surprised your name didn't  come up, Dianna," Sarah said.</p><p>"Good point," Dan said,  expanding the criteria to both genders. The list now read: Arzish, Berkley,  Carter, Dorsey, Langley, Morris, Norfolk, O'Neil, Smith, Stevens, Terson, and  Winston.</p><p>"So this is it?" Ranma  said, glancing over the rather small list.</p><p>"Yes.  These are the people capable enough in Calash and able to get into <i>very</i> secure systems," Dan said. "Lockridge  is a small town.</p><p>"Well  cut out you three, and I guess Erika can be removed," Ranma said, looking  over the list.</p><p>"Done," Dan said. The  names were now: Carter, Dorsey, Langley, Morris, Norfolk, Smith, Stevens, and  Winston.</p><p>"So, you trust us. Interesting,"  Allison said in a calm, amused voice.</p><p>"Don't make a bad situation worse,"  Sarah stated.</p><p>"What? One of us could easily  be doing it," Allison said while grinning ever so slightly.</p><p>"So, Ranma. What about Spooky  and his holographic girl?" Dan asked.</p><p>"He admitted to making the  template, and he moved here. He has lived in fear his whole life. I don't think  he would do something like this, or be stupid enough to come here. If Gos was  behind this, he'd be in Prague or Brazil, someplace far away"</p><p>"He made that template Ranma.  It was obviously a form of revenge. Gos was probably too scared to ever use it,  but the intent was there."</p><p>"Okay, so who's first?"</p><p>"Abigail Carter," Dan read.</p><p>"Stick in the mud," Allison remarked.</p><p>"Yeah, I'd have to agree," Sarah said.</p><p>"Who's she?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Hmm," Allison mused as she walked over to the  Student Lounges' railing. "Ah, there she is," the blonde said  pointing to glass fronting on the school.</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"Front yard, to the right of the sidewalk, under the  second tree."</p><p>Ranma followed the directions to see a long-haired  brunette reading in the shade of a smallish maple.</p><p>"Any guesses on what she's reading?" Allison  asked, rummaging in her bag.</p><p>"It'd say it's a second edition of the <i>Hitchhiker's Guide Trilogy</i>," Dan  said, squinting slightly behind his dark shades.</p><p>"Five book version or four?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"We'll see," Allison said, finally pulling out  her binoculars. "Wait," she said, about to look into the field  glasses. She slowly turned around, studying her boyfriend's face. "Ah ha!"  the blonde announced when she saw the slight reddish glow from behind Dan's  sunglasses.</p><p>"You think she's behind this?" Ranma asked,  looking at Sarah who was shaking her head.</p><p>"Well, I was friends with Abby during grade school. She's  a nice enough girl.  A bit dry, but okay."</p><p>"That's an understatement. She's as dull as a bag of  door knobs." Allison said, watching the girl under the tree. "You know  what she does with her Calash potential?"</p><p>"What?" Ranma asked, hoping that Allison's  statements won't be too off the wall.</p><p>"Miniatures. She makes tiny little models of things."</p><p>"She is rather good. You know the kind of detail and  patience needed to do that," Sarah said.</p><p>"That and her database skills are the reason she's  in here," Dan added, rechecking his spreadsheet.</p><p>"Database?"</p><p>"Yeah, she's eerie," Sarah stated, leaning on  the lounge's railing. "Put her in front of a linked list, array, or  what-have-you and she'll make it dance."</p><p>"Gee, I wonder why," Allison deadpanned,  looking over the redhead's shoulder.</p><p>"It's that exact kind of concentration that we're  looking for," Dan said.</p><p>"You think she's our hacker?" Ranma asked,  looking at the girl. She seemed so normal and calm. He looked back at his  friends and sighed. At first glance they looked normal too. Ranma thought on  that matter for a minute. No, that wasn't exactly true. That first meeting with  Dan was rather unsettling, Sarah was practicing with her shotgun, and Allison  had appeared out of nowhere. No, as always, normality was a rare commodity in  Ranma's life.</p><p>"She could be," Dan said. "Sarah, you've  known her, could she be behind it?"</p><p>Sarah looked back at the girl. "Well she probably  has the abilities to do it. Provided that she's spent the last few years  studying how to hack like that, but as we've said, she has that kind of  patience."</p><p>"Rating?" Allison asked.</p><p>"Three-Five"</p><p>"Really that high?" Dan said, puzzlement edging  his voice.</p><p>"Sure. She's a possible."</p><p>"You guys have ranking system," Ranma said,  observing the insanity.</p><p>"Yes, it's actually quite simple. You see it's based  on the probability of a statement being true combined with a risk factor,  numbers are obviously assigned in increasing gradients."</p><p>"So you just rate from One to Ten, or something like  that."</p><p>"It's cooler the way I say it."</p><p>"I'm sure it is. So what are we going to do about  her?"</p><p>"I'll talk to Abby later today," Sarah said.</p><p>"Right, like she'll just break down and confess,"  Allison remarked. "Our hacker's too clever for that."</p><p>"I'm counting on that. If Abby is the hacker bitch  and I call her out, what do you think she's going to do? No, I'm going to ask  her if she's had any of her archives broken into lately."</p><p>"She may be paranoid enough to try and dispatch you  right then and there," Dan said.</p><p>"At least then we'll know who we're up against."</p><p>"I'm not so sure," Dan said, filling in Abby's  profile. "We will talk about this later. Hmm Dorsey, Fred."</p><p>"Didn't his family live next door to yours,"  Allison observed.</p><p>"Yes, back when Mom was alive and we lived in my  father's house."</p><p>"You know him well?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"We lived a couple miles apart, but yeah, we were  pals."</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"After the accident, I moved in with the O'Neil's  and we drifted apart. It happens."</p><p>"Why's he on the list?"</p><p>"He specializes in template upgrades."</p><p>"Really."</p><p>"There are a lot of people who can make a template,  but it just won't turn out very good. For a nominal fee he helps them."</p><p>"I thought you guys don't need money. What with all  your illegal back-dealings."</p><p>"Oh, he doesn't get paid in money. He barters for  favors and such."</p><p>"If these people couldn't make a decent  template…"</p><p>Dan cut him off, "Just because they can't program a  temp doesn't mean they don't have other talents. I remember this one time Fred re-built  the servo system for some Iron Man fan out in Boise and got design prints to  some DOD satellite tech."</p><p>"So you think he could have integrated the template  Gos designed with the Organic tech that Erika developed?"</p><p>"Absolutely," Dan said from his machine.</p><p>"Rating?" Allison asked.</p><p>"Four-four," Dan proposed.</p><p>"I'd have to agree with that," Sarah said,  reading the spreadsheet.</p><p>"You want to handle him like Abby?" Allison  asked.</p><p>"I can do that," Dan remarked with reserve, his  face neutral. He remained silent while typing in the updated profile.</p><p>"So who's next?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"Langley," Dan read, staring at the screen, "Rebecca  Langley."</p><p>Sarah turned to the blonde with a slight grin, "I  guess this' your field."</p><p>Allison glared at the redhead before glancing over at  Dan, who was now reading the log on Rebecca.</p><p>"Are we talking about the same girl that Allison  dated before Dan?"</p><p>"Yes," Dan said. "Why don't you tell  Ran-Man about her? I mean, you did know her the best of all of us," he  said rather calmly.</p><p>Allison inhaled sharply before starting. "Rebecca's  a nice enough girl. It's just that she distances herself from others. She has a  hard time getting close to people. She did lose both her parents."</p><p>"Allison, you're one of the only people I know that  still has both of her parents," Sarah stated flatly.</p><p>Ranma looked over at his sister. Even though her father  was still alive, Jack was never around. It was almost as if he was in the  military and out on assignment, and in their increasingly unnerving acceptance,  Dan and Sarah simply took his absence in stride. It did make sense that the  elder O'Neil be missing like that. Granted, policing a place like Lockridge  seemed to be an immense task, but considering the recent attacks were centered  on his own family, one would assume that the sheriff would take a more active  role. Whenever Ranma made inquires into this, whether it was with Jack himself  or one of the other members of the O'Neil household, he received a mix of blank  stares and thin explanations relating to separation of powers and jurisdiction.</p><p>Ranma sighed, Jack was working on something, but people  seemed to either keep it a secret or simply not tell them. As he thought this  over, the others continued their discussion about the Langley girl. From their  discussion, it became apparent that this girl, much like Allison had a strange  sense of humor, although she preferred to simply observe the antics of others. The  blonde maintained that while Langley had the skills to pull something like this  off, she would not care to put in the effort to do it.</p><p>"Just talk to her about it," Dan said, making  some notes on the spreadsheet.</p><p>"Okay, but I don't think that she's behind this,"  Allison maintained.</p><p>"If you think your bias will get in the way-"  Sarah started to suggest before she was cut off.</p><p>"No, if she is the hacker bitch, I will be the first  to know," Allison vowed.</p><p>"Good. Moving on." Dan said. "Bradford  Morris."</p><p>"How the hell did that prick end up in there?"  Allison exclaimed.</p><p>"Say what you will about him. He is a good mod at  templates."</p><p>"Like that Fred guy?" Ranma said.</p><p>"Pretty much," Sarah agreed.</p><p>"I wouldn't say that much," a new voice added.</p><p>Ranma turned to see one of his classmates standing in  front of their table. It was the unremarkable brunette that was nonplused by  his curse. He thought her name started with a J and ended with a vowel.</p><p>"Hey Julie," Sarah said cautiously. "Sorry,  we're just having a conversation."</p><p>"It's fine. You guys just watch it around Brad. He  can be a real pain."</p><p>"Okay." Sarah said, then turning to her brother.  "Ranma this is Julie Winston."</p><p>"We've met," Ranma said.</p><p>"Yes, it was about a week ago wasn't it? You were  the one with that gender virus." Julie recalled.</p><p>"Yeah, that's me," Ranma sighed.</p><p>"Where's Ned?" Dan asked. "He didn't come  to school today."</p><p>"After he came back from your place last night, he  went straight to his room and then down to his workshops. I remember because  when he moved some equipment out of his room it woke me up. I opened the door  to see him carting some crates to the elevator."</p><p>"And this was after he helped us last night?"  Sarah asked.</p><p>"Yeah. So this morning I stopped off to see if he  was ready to go to school. He normally drives me, but he said he was skipping,  that he had a lot of work to do."</p><p>"So how'd you get here?" Allison asked, still  watching the outside of the school.</p><p>"I carpooled with Reggie and the other security  people. Their shift change was close enough."</p><p>"So they're still cleaning up," Allison noted. From  the lounge's windows, she could not see the WIC work site. The fight with the  guymelef had taken place in the fields immediately behind the school.</p><p>"Yes, Ned wants to get all the information he can  from that wreck."</p><p>"So what is he up to now?" Dan asked.</p><p>"I have no idea." Julie said. "The only  people he's allowing in his workshops are Dave, our Security Chief, and the  head of the Teakettle facility."</p><p>"Strange."</p><p>"Not really. Sometimes he gets an idea and locks  himself in his workshop for a few days. The extra security doesn't even really  mean much. Ned's always been a bit paranoid. Unlike some people, he doesn't let  it get to him."</p><p>"You still having problems with Brad?" Sarah  observed.</p><p>"Don't say that jackass' name," Julie hissed,  her eyes darting around the lounge and the foyer below.</p><p>"I don't see why you don't have Ned and some of his  associates rough him up," Dan observed.</p><p>"We've tried. It doesn't work," Julie said.  "Crap there he is," she said, looking at the stairs leading up to the  lounge.</p><p>Ranma looked over to see this Brad person. A bit shorter  than Dan, he had blond hair parted on the right and gray eyes. His clothing seemed  a bit more expensive than what most of the students wore, but was still fairly  practical. His stride was quite confident, as his eyes scanned the lounge  gauging his fellow students.</p><p>"Hey Julie," Brad said once he reached the top  of the stairs.</p><p>"Go away," Julie said, looking past him.</p><p>"Come on, you don't really mean that," he  replied, his smile showing a surprising amount of teeth.</p><p>"The girl told you to leave. I suggest you do so,"  Dan said, closing his laptop.</p><p>"Really tin man, you care to take this outside,"  Brad said, his smile distinctly predatory.</p><p>"I'd drop you before you could bend your first  spoon."</p><p>"Try me."</p><p>"What the hell is going on? Who's this Brad guy"  Ranma quietly asked his sister.</p><p>"Meet Bradford Morris, candidate number four. He's a  basic preppie jerk. Sadly though, he's rather competent with Calash. His  template allows him to move metal with his mind."</p><p>"Great, and since Dan's a cyborg-"</p><p>"Yeah, the prick waves that over Dan's head."</p><p>"What did you call me?" Brad said.</p><p>"You didn't hear me Bradford? I called you a prick."</p><p>Brad's eyes narrowed.</p><p>"Oh, you don't like that you egotistical fuck."</p><p>Brad simply stared at the redhead.</p><p>"What's the matter Bradford?" Sarah said,  staring him down.</p><p>Brad stepped forward.</p><p>"If you mess with my sister you mess with me."  Ranma stated, standing up.</p><p>"How wonderfully clichéd," Allison interrupted.  "But yes, if you try to touch any of us, we'll drop you like a sack of  dirt."</p><p>"Eloquent as always my Terson, but right now my feud  is with this newbie," Brad said, looking Ranma over. "Tell me do you  even <i>have</i> a template? Or are you  waiting for sis to make you one."</p><p>Ranma looked at Brad, paused for a second then began to snicker.  Oh yes, he had a template, not that he wanted the damn thing.</p><p>"What the hell are you laughing at?"</p><p>Ranma looked over at the jerk. None of the others seemed  to be taking him that seriously. "You wouldn't understand it," Ranma  said simply.</p><p>"Oh, so you think I'm slow," Brad replied,  narrowing his eyes.</p><p>Sarah had stepped back and was watching impassively. She  knew that Brad was testing out the waters, trying to back her brother into a  corner to see how he reacted.</p><p>"Well I don't know you, but you do seem to be  bothering Julie."</p><p>"So now you're telling me what to do?" Brad  asked, his fingers twitching slightly.</p><p>"Shut up  Bradford," Dan said, his gaze leveled at the other teen. "Back off  from Ranma, he isn't a part of this."</p><p>"You're gonna let them fight your battles for you?"  Brad said, turning to Ranma. "I guess you're not man enough to take care  of yourself."</p><p>"Coming from a stalker, those words are pretty damn  hollow," Allison observed.</p><p>"Come on Ranma, are you going to hide behind these  slackers and degenerates?"</p><p>"Is this a challenge?" Ranma asked, trying to  see where this was going.</p><p>Brad paused for a split second as he shifted gears. Why  not, he would be able to get a good bearing on this newbie. "Yes it is, if  you're up to it."</p><p>Ranma's response was automatic. "I accept."</p><p>"Good. In ten minutes, out back," Brad said,  recalling the status of those fields.</p><p>"Until when?"</p><p>"Yield, or knockout," Brad said before turning  and walking down the hall.</p><p>"So what template does Brad have?" Ranma asked,  watching Sarah shake her head while Dan slapped his hand to his forehead.</p><p>"So this goober just has powers over metal. Bending  spoons, making stuff fly and such." Ranma said as they walked out into the  field. His relatives had spent the time briefing him on Brad's template and  method of fighting. "I can see why you guys are reluctant to fight him."</p><p>"Hey! He might, <i>might,  </i>be able to stop a bullet. But not a whole group of them," Sarah said,  putting her hand to her side.</p><p>"Although having metal bones won't help,"  Allison said, chuckling.</p><p>Dan sighed then looked at Ranma. "Remember he's  limited by how much he can alter the kinetic energy of an object, and he can  only influence something if it's metal. According to Julie it's because of how  metallic bonds have a 'sea of electrons' or some such nonsense."</p><p>"Right. The faster it moves the harder it would be  for him to deflect," Ranma proposed.</p><p>"We think he can control around about a half a dozen  items simultaneously," Allison said.</p><p>"And you don't want to go into template?" Dan  asked.</p><p>"No." Ranma said flatly.</p><p>"Oh, that's just what you want," Allison said  to her boyfriend. "A little angel bouncing around in a skimpy skirt."</p><p>"Actually, I think that's what you want," Sarah  mumbled.</p><p>"I don't know why you guys are so worried about this  bully," Ranma said.</p><p>"He tries to be a bully. Bradford's just an arrogant  asshole. He can't really do anything against us without us killing him, but neither  can we punish him for being a prick," Dan shrugged.</p><p>"Then why'd he want to fight me?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"You're the new kid. You insulted him by dismissal. And  you forced him into it," the blonde said.</p><p>"Well that's normal. Most of my fights are due to  piddling crap like this," Ranma said.</p><p>"Like the time someone swore revenge on you because  of a pastry?" the redhead observed.</p><p>"It was several <i>flavored</i>  pieces of bread, Sarah," Ranma said as if that made some difference.</p><p>"Well if it isn't the Clue Crew? Are you going to  drive around solving mysteries in your van?" Brad said while smirking.</p><p>"Clue Crew? The Fuck? Isn't that from Jeopardy?"  Sarah asked.</p><p>"Silence, insolent wench!" Brad said.</p><p>"Bradford, what the hell's going on? This is lame,  even for you," Dan said.</p><p>Brad ignored the comment and looked at Ranma. "You'd  better keep your friends out of this."</p><p>"Don't worry," Ranma said, narrowing his eyes.</p><p>"Then let's  begin," Brad said as he activated his template. Ranma watched as Brad's  clothing changed to a black jumpsuit with a dark brown harness. Clipped onto  the harness were numerous gleaming pieces of metal, ranging from long pointed stakes  clipped to shoulder straps, to a number of shot filled pouches clipped to his  waist belt.</p><p>The air around Brad took on a strange shimmer. He smiled  as a pair of steel stakes slipped out of their clips and floated in front of  him. Ranma watched as the stakes rotated to face him. Then as if propelled by  invisible engines, the two sharpened lengths of metal charged at him.</p><p>Ranma dodged low and to the left only to see them adjust  their trajectory. Keeping on the move, Ranma watched the projectiles grow  nearer. He also watched Brad's expression. The teen tried to keep his face  neutral, but each time he maneuvered the projectiles his face took on a slight  strain that seemed to increase with the distance they got from him.</p><p>Maneuvering forward, Ranma watched as the stakes closed  in. Waiting until they were a foot from his head, he then grabbed the two stakes.  Twisting them away from his head, the lengths of metal felt slightly warm and  rather prickly. The two lengths squirmed in his hands like angry weasels as  Ranma tried to hold them back. Glancing over at his opponent, Ranma saw that  Brad's face was strained but amused.</p><p>The two stakes in Ranma's hands became lifeless, turning  back into inert metal. Acting on instinct and training, Ranma tossed the two stakes  into the ground while ducking down and forward. He felt another shard of metal  fly past him. Ranma looked up to see it slow down as it was about to reverse  direction.</p><p>The martial artist cupped his hands and without bothering  to shout the name of his attack, shot out a small ki bolt. The blast of ki  launched and intersected with the projectile as it approached Ranma. It hit the  bit of metal without any visible effect in the first half second.</p><p><i>So the punk finally  decided to activate his template,</i> Brad thought as the strange blast was  released. Instinctively, he increased his mental hold on the weapon to  stabilize it when the blast impacted with it. This proved to be a mistake. A  piercing pain flashed into Brad's mind. Gritting his teeth, he severed his hold  on the stake, instantly silencing the pain.</p><p>Brad had only felt a sensation like this once before. When  he had first been testing out his template, Brad had foolishly flown a fork  right into an electrical socket. The same bonding properties that lent metal to  his brand of Calash-enabled telekinetic control allowed for the metal to absorb  and carry various types of energy, be it thermal, electric, or magnetic. Unfortunately  the connection Brad had to his weapons was not one-way. He could maneuver metal  through his will, but his will was also bound by the metal it was in.</p><p>Ranma knew none of this. All he knew was that blasting  one of Brad's weapons caused him pain and forced him to let go of the weapon he  controlled. Ranma charged forward. Brad responded by flinging a series of metal  stakes at Ranma. Dodging them, Ranma was surprised when they did not correct  their course, instead falling down to the ground. Closing in on Brad, Ranma  released a pair of ki blasts aimed at the center of the teen's chest.</p><p>Brad concentrated on the metal strips in his harness and  jumped back while opening one of the pouches on his waist. Ranma looked to see  Brad make an impossible dodge. His body seeming to defy gravity. Then Ranma  noticed how the teen's body seemed to be held up by the harness.</p><p>Ranma closed in, crossing in front of Brad. Only a few  yards away he fired another Moukou Takabishi at the gel-haired teen. Brad  tossed the handful of shot. He clenched his teeth; at this range he had only  one chance, and it was going to hurt. A lot. Using his full abilities, Brad  maneuvered the small metallic spheres into a rough cup shape and blocked the  blast.</p><p>The ki collided with the collection of telekinetically  controlled projectiles. The reaction was spectacular. In a flash of mostly  infrared light, Ranma's energy hit Brad's. Brad headache grew into new and  amazing proportions with the reaction. The spheres exploded outward.</p><p>The metal was traveling slow enough that Ranma was able  to dodge or deflect the vast majority of the ones that came towards him. The  worst was one that hit just above his right wrist. But right now he was able to  fight. Although his right hand might be more stiff.</p><p>Brad was in a different shape. His head felt like it  contained a small smelting plant and his body nearly avoided serious injury. One  of the balls would have taken his left eye, had he not deflected it to cut his  ear instead.</p><p>"Oh, fuck this," Brad said as he pulled himself  up. With one hand he held his forehead in the other he pulled out a stake. His  headache was already subsiding. He was scowling in barely controlled rage.</p><p>Ranma readied himself. His opponent was weakened. A few  more good hits and Brad should go down, provided that he did not get hit by a  metal spike before that happens. Wincing slightly at the pain in his wrist,  Ranma charged at Brad while readying another ki blast.</p><p>Brad then dropped the stake and put his hands at his sides.  He smirked slightly there was another reason  he chose this place.</p><p>The salvage team from Winston Industrial Container was  still processing the remains of the mech. It was then that they noticed some of  the shards of  broken mech armor starting  to move.</p><p>Brad saw Ranma move in and pulled himself back while  flinging a chunk of armor the size of a refrigerator door in between him and  Ranma.</p><p>The martial artist vaulted over the slab of metal while  firing a shot at Brad, who was now far enough away to dodge using his harness.  As Ranma landed, he saw three other, slightly  smaller, slabs of metal move in towards him.</p><p>Brad was trying to box him in. Ranma ran over to the  opening between the two pieces to his left.   Naturally, Brad rotated the slabs so that one faced Ranma and moved them  in, hoping to contain the martial artist.</p><p>Brad frowned slightly as Ranma jumped onto the large  chunk of metal and used it to springboard up to his position. Brad's face  returned to it's focused state as he flung a few dozen ball bearings at Ranma.  Normally it was more than he could control,  but the identical dimensions and similar vectors simplified things.</p><p>The martial artist charged his hands with a small bit of  ki and deflected the balls as they came at him.   The ki was small but it provided enough feedback to force Brad to pull  out.</p><p>As Ranma reached the apex of his leap, he lobbed a ki  blast at Brad who flung an armor slab in between himself and the bolt of  energy.  Brad removed his control just  before it hit.  The slab fell a few  inches but managed to block the blow before falling to the ground.</p><p>At the same time Brad launched another plate of metal at  his opponent.  Ranma grabbed onto it and  used it to propel himself towards Brad, who launched a pair of stakes. Ranma  blocked Brad's attack and fired a ki blast this time aiming at Brad's harness.</p><p>The energy impacted and created a very strong feedback.  The telekinetic did not have time to make a choice. He felt a lance of pain  travel through his brain while his harness seemed to burn on his body.</p><p>Reflexively, he shut off all his powers.  The floating metallic debris crashed to the  ground, as did Brad.</p><p>As Ranma made his landing, he watched Brad rekindle his  powers just enough to retard his fall.   Unlike Ranma, Brad's left foot hit the ground badly causing him to fall  to the side.</p><p>Ranma approached quickly, but cautiously.  His opponent did not seem to be terribly hurt  and might have a few more tricks.</p><p>Brad pulled himself up. Grinding his teeth, he pulled out  a quartet of stakes and held two in each hand.   As he watched at Ranma close in, he made his decision.</p><p>"Ahh fuck it," Brad said as he dropped the  stakes. "I yield," Brad said after sitting down on the grass.</p><p>"What?" Ranma demanded as he watched his  opponent. "You can still fight."</p><p>"Maybe," Brad remarked as he dropped out of  template. "I quit."</p><p>"Fine." Ranma said, very annoyed. "I  accept," he said while thinking, <i>You  damn pansy.</i></p><p>"Good for you."</p><p>Ranma looked down at Brad, anger welling up within him.  "If you were just going to quit, why the hell did you challenge me in the  first place?"</p><p>"I thought I could beat you. How was I to know some  newbie had developed a mental feedback whatever the hell that was," Brad  said simply.</p><p>"You insufferable ass!"</p><p>"Yeah, I get that a lot," Brad admitted.</p><p>"Okay then," Ranma said as he walked back to  Sarah and the others.</p><p>"Well, that was pointless," Dan observed.</p><p>"Want to go back to class?" Allison asked.</p><p>"You gonna be okay, Bradford?" Sarah asked. She  did not really care, but would feel somewhat guilty if he died.</p><p>"I'm fine. You did good kid.  I'd like to see what you're capable of with a  real template," Brad said, as he sat on the ground.</p><p>"Whatever," Ranma said as he followed his  friends back to class.</p><p>"Do you really need me to go into template?"  Ranma asked.  When they got back home  from school, they found a message from Gos on the answering machine.  It was a short drive to Reno's apartment,  where Gos and Erika were staying. Dan had driven him over while Allison and  Sarah had stayed home.  Sarah's father  Jack was home and she wanted to talk to the sheriff about something, and  Allison wanted to take a nap.</p><p>"Yes," the pathetic teen who had to build a  girlfriend replied. "I want a scan of the most recent version of the  template. I should have scanned you when you were here yesterday."</p><p>"Fine," Ranma sighed. He first shifted into  girl-form.  She then tried to activate  her template. Instead she found herself being redirected slightly. She found  herself bringing her hands over her heart. Then as she tapped her Rose Ring she  heard herself whisper "Angelic Rose," then shouted "Make-Up!"</p><p>She shuddered as a glowing red whirlwind engulfed her. It  then shifted in color becoming a sparking pink. Everything she was wearing was  torn apart and turned into small pink roses and white feathers. The roses  formed into pink high heeled boots and her glittery pink trimmed and pink bowed  fuku. The feathers formed into her white, full-sized, angel wings and her delicate  silver bracers, engraved in pink vines and roses.</p><p>The pink light then came down onto her head and hands,  still clasped over her chest. It infused itself in her hair and skin. It  unbounded her hair which was then styled into a feathered wavy body with pink,  glittery highlights. Part was pulled back with a pink bow in a loose, high pony  tail while the rest flowed freely. The glittery light then placed highly  feminizing, pink, and glittery makeup.</p><p>It then created her jewelry. Her earrings, dangling gold  roses, seemed to grow from simple pierced studs. A golden, pink-jeweled tiara  then formed into place. Finally, her choker, with its egg-shaped piece of glass  containing a perfectly frozen rose, appeared around her neck.</p><p>Ranma blinked, her eyelids feeling the weight of her very  faded very glittery pink eyeshadow. She looked at her delicate looking hands  with their manicured, sparkling pink nails. Four words then came out of her  coral pink lips. "What the fucking hell?"</p><p>Dan smirked.</p><p>"That was a transformation sequence," Gos said,  blinking.</p><p>"Gee, you think?"  Ranma replied harshly as her wings folded  back.</p><p>"What happened?" Erika said as she entered the  living room from the guest bedroom.</p><p>"Fucking template!" Ranma muttered as she  looked at her miniskirt.</p><p>"Look's like its back to glitter and pink," Dan  observed.</p><p>"Why?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Maybe the organic tech decided that you need to be  more magical girly," Dan suggested.</p><p>"Not likely," Gos said as he set up his I/O  sphere and began to take readings.   "Adding an activation phrase and a transformation sequence has no  benefit. No. I'd guess that our hacker bitch did this to torment you."</p><p>"Yeah, that sounds about right," Erika stated.</p><p>"Whoever she is, she will pay," Ranma stated as  she balled her fists, her manicured nails digging into her palms.</p><p>Dan snickered.  He  found the image of such a femininely dressed girl vowing vengeance amusing.</p><p>"Watch it," Ranma said, her eyes glowing a  slight pink.</p><p>Rebecca smiled when she heard the phone ring. It was  almost a quarter of eight. "Impeccable timing, a very good sign," she  noted to herself, picking the phone up on the third ring.</p><p>"You did as requested," she observed as if  stating an obvious truth: Oh yes, space is mostly empty and rather big.</p><p>She smiled at the response.</p><p>"Nope. How did things go?" Rebecca asked,  getting the reason she sent the caller out.</p><p>"Come back as soon as you can. We're entering the  next phase," she then added, her tone gaining a slight edge.</p><p>"Well, strong words. That's not what you first  thought of me, and I have <i>never</i> lied  to you. You don't get lost. You no longer turn into a pig. And you will have  your revenge against Ranma," she replied, maintaining her slight smile.</p><p>Rebecca laughed at the caller's next statement. "Free  will was never part of the bargain. Besides, you chose to enter my house. You  chose to listen to me. You chose to stay. You gave no objection to the  treatments nor the operations. You're what you are because of yourself, never  forget that."</p><p>What came out of the speaker made her grin deepen. "Looks  like the slowest horse crossed the finish line after all. See you soon."</p><p>"We shall see about that," Rebecca replied to  the caller's final statement before hanging up the phone.</p><p>Ranma opened her eyes to see a pink sky. She blinked with  puzzlement as she saw a bright pink cloud move slowly over a darker pink  background. Groaning, she pulled the rose-tinted sunglasses off of her face.  Leaning up, she found herself on a reclining piece of outdoor furniture. She  then noticed that she was wearing a two piece bathing suit. It was almost a  bikini. It was white with pink roses. She sighed as she looked at the Rose Ring  still on her finger. Her hair simply fell behind her shoulders. Her curse  forced her to use female swimwear. It was something she did not like but had to  accept.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that she was in front of  an in-ground pool and not alone. To her left she could see Allison in a silver  bikini, and to her right was Sarah in an orange one piece with red trim. Next  to the blonde, a female Dan was asleep. She was wearing a dark violet bikini of  the same style as her girlfriend's. Ranma shook her head at this.</p><p>"Look who's up," Erika said. Ranma turned her  head to see her standing behind her chair.</p><p>"Where are we?" Ranma asked, standing up. She  squinted her eyes. Annoyed at the particularly bright sunlight, but unwilling  to put those sunglasses back on.</p><p>"We decided to take a break. So we drove over to  Allison's parent's house," Sarah said, leaning up.</p><p>"Yeah. We got a pool last year," Allison said,  her eyes closed.</p><p>"Oh yeah," Ranma said, remembering it. She had  planned on swimming and had used the ring to create a swimsuit. None of  Allison's would fit her and Sarah had only brought one. However, she decided to  take a nap. Walking over to the edge, she looked at the water. Crystal blue, it  looked extremely inviting. Kneeling down, she placed her glasses on the edge  and prepared herself to jump in.</p><p>She smiled slightly as she went airborne. She barely had  time to register shock as the water changed color. She cringed as she hit the  glittering pink liquid. She tried swimming to the surface, but was soon  disoriented, by the swirling, sparkling fluid. Soon she found herself floating  with no sense of orientation. The only thing she could see was the radiant  semi-clear pink. She had no bearings at all. There was no up, no down, no  ground, no walls, just her and the pinkness.</p><p>It itched her skin and irritated her eyes. She was out of  air. Her body, starved for oxygen, rebelled. Her mouth opened and she inhaled  the liquid. She gagged at the taste. It was minty, sweet, and syrupy. It also  seemed to writhe slightly. Her lungs had filled with the stuff, but she had yet  to drown.</p><p>She took another breath, wincing as the pink juice flowed  into her sinuses. It was somehow oxygenated. She remembered there was a movie  where deep-sea divers used a liquid to breathe with. The itching on her skin  suddenly increased. The liquid began to glow becoming an iridescent pink. It  felt like the liquid was oozing through her pores. She felt her swimsuit  dissolve away.</p><p>With a distant pain it began to consume the girl,  replacing her with itself. She looked down to see her skin pulsating and  screamed. The pink then rushed down her throat. Reflexively, she swallowed  consuming it as it consumed her.</p><p>Unable to control herself, she continued drinking the  vile soup, even as it rushed into her orifices absorbing her. She saw that her  hair had turned glittery and pink and had grown. To what length she could not  tell, for it seemed to merge with the liquid that surrounded her. She shuddered  as great glowing pink wings formed. The feathers seemed to simultaneously pour  from her body and form out of the liquid. Her skin was now the same glowing  sparkling color.</p><p>She gave a moment's thought to what was under that skin.  Would she have pink blood? Organs that were recognizable? Anything organic at  all? Or would it just be a sloshing mass of pink contained by a pink bag? She  closed her eyes shedding a single tear of a material indistinguishable to from  that of the liquid sounding her. Her eyes had just changed and she knew what  was next.</p><p>The woman gave one last wrenching gulp. After swallowing  the liquid, her pink lips gave a contented smile. Her eyes then fluttered open.  Sparkling, swirling, pink corneas looked out into the abyss.</p><p>Ranma flipped up, nearly hitting her head on the ceiling.  Breathing deeply, and quite relieved that it was just air she looked at her  hands. It was too dark to be sure. Blinking hard, she pulled her pigtail so  that she could look at it. In the dim light it looked dark enough. She then  jumped down to the floor. She shook her head while she walked out of the room  and to the bathroom. She could have turned on the lights in her room and looked  into Sarah's mirror, but that might have woken her sister up.</p><p>In the bathroom, she forced her eyes to stay open as she  turned on the lights. She was rewarded with the familiar image of a blue-eyed  redhead. She gave a sigh of relief as she looked over her reflection. She did  not like her girl form, but would rather it not be turned into that pink  – thing.</p><p>Staring at herself she tried to remember the dream. She  got fragments. This was more than she normally could remember. Usually she was  left with the mental equivalent of a horrid taste on her mouth, a decidedly  unpleasant mental taint.</p><p>She heard someone enter the hallway. Ranma then saw her  sister's reflection in the mirror as Sarah entered the small room. "Bad  dream?" Sarah asked, trying to mask the concern in her voice. They were  getting more frequent, and even Ranma was willing to admit that there <i>might</i> be a problem.</p><p>Ranma nodded slowly as she looked at her sister. The two  redheads were close in appearance, although it was obvious that Sarah had Irish  blood in her. Sarah's hair was a tinge lighter than Ranma's almost scarlet  hair. Sarah was also a bit taller. Although, it was hard to tell now because  Ranma was leaning on the sink and Sarah was leaning on the doorframe.</p><p>Despite being a nearly year older than Sarah, Ranma's  face was that of an Asian girl which looked younger than Sarah's which was a  bit more mature looking. Despite being more muscularly developed than Sarah,  Ranma's frame still seemed smaller somehow. Ranma shook her head. No, they were  the same like that. She was just being paranoid.</p><p>"You okay?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"I can't take this damn template much longer,"  Ranma admitted as she checked over her body for changes again.  Everything still looked the same.</p><p>"Don't worry; we have some suspects now.  We'll find that bitch.  Hell, Gos is working on your template  too.  He said that he has some  interesting findings."</p><p>"Maybe," Ranma admitted as she continued to  look at her reflection.  Eventually she  pulled away from the mirror and followed her sister back to their room.</p><p>Gos looked at his laptop with a mix of fear and self  loathing. Now that brought him back. It was not enough that he made that  template. No, he had to keep it around. Pride, sick pride. He was jealous of  Ranma, and in his darkened den he had a way to live his dreams of revenge. It  would be easy to hit Ranma where it hurt.</p><p>He thought he had left that all behind. He had a  girlfriend now. He escaped Nerima. He was making reparations. But the past  refused to stay where it should. He had found it while going over the scans he  had of Ranma's template.</p><p>There was only a slim chance of it happening, without the  Organic Tech it would have been impossible, but now the door was open. Gos had  hoped it would not have happened, but was that even really an option?</p><p>Looking over he could see Erika watching her movie. It  was the first time she had watched it in human form and Gos could see here eyes  misting. It really was a sad story. Driven slowly but surely insane by  conflicting orders and directives, the character was someone that Erika could  empathize with. Gos smiled just a little bit as he observed his girlfriend  watch HAL 9000's journey into madness.</p><p>He was alone with his discovery. After the bonding with  Erika, this was another thing that he thought was behind him. While Erika could  easily see what was on his screen, she could not see what he was really working  on. The laptop he was working on was no more tangible than he was. It was  simply a construct he used  instead of  the direct machine interface he now possessed. That is if one could call a  being like Erika a mere machine.</p><p>The irony was amazing. Gos had stolen the life's work of  the leading researchers in AI to create Erika, and then someone else had stolen  Erika's Organic Tech research and his temp codes to make Ranma's template, and  now...</p><p>Now Gos had no idea what was going to happen. There were  too many factors. He could see the changes beginning in Ranma, and in theory he  should be able to derive where they would lead. Gos might not get the exact  details right, but he should have a fairly good idea of the order and the shape  of the events.</p><p>Unfortunately the developments in Ranma's template seemed  to be too erratic to predict. No, this did not look good. Gos scrolled his  notes hoping to find error in his train of thought. Strange data headings stuck  out as he reread his rants, diagrams, hypothesis and sketches.</p><p>"Subconscious Linkage, ANX 1.34 subclass 12, see  figs 5a, 34, 23" headed a section diagramming and specifying Ranma's  accoutrements. Most of the data seemed to be attached to the workings of that  compact of hers. Gos was worriedly trying to figure out how that device managed  to be created. It seemed to prove the versatility of Organic Tech, but there  were still questions as to the stability of the system.</p><p>"Punctuated Allocation Shift, 17 instances in 2  trials, inconclusive" fronted a section containing two three-dimensional  graphical plots, followed by a paragraph of dense text. The pale hologram  sighed at this; there was simply not enough data to work with.</p><p>Gos gave a twisted smile at the "Cascading Failure  in Modification Algorithms Probability: Minimal," title heading. At least  he could confidently tell Ranma that his template almost definitely will not  kill him. The numbers showed that a critical error in those sections will not  result in termination of the host form. Gos would have preferred to have more  information, but at least in this case the calculations seemed straightforward  enough. That should be reasonably good news.</p><p>The next section was not. Entitled "Security  Countermeasures of Template R Alpha Unlicensed Modification Set," it  described the various systems Ranma's template had to thwart unauthorized  access. Gos did have to give the hacker bitch credit she seemed to be as good  in creating security systems as she was in disabling them.</p><p>The following sections Gos was not so sure of. It was not  because he doubted the veracity of his paper. The reread he gave the document  seemed to confirm its accuracy. The question came in what these conclusions  meant. Gos wondered if Ranma and his friends really needed to know this  information.</p><p>Named "Projected Trends in the Development of G  Section," it appeared harmless enough. That was until one realized that,  the data this section used was known only by two people, Gos and the hacker  bitch. Gos knew that she was watching her little test subject. She would be  tracking the changes same as him.</p><p>The section ended with a log, starting with Day Zero. Most  of the entries were blank and the rest simply contained a strange shorthand  referring to earlier passages of this section. The last entry was simply  labeled – Projected to Emerge, followed by two very similar images.</p><p>Gos sighed as he read those last paragraphs. Oh that  template certainly won't kill the host body. Whether or not the host would  still be Ranma in the strictest definition of the word is the question. The  Improvement Modules were simply doing their job. They were optimizing systems. Finding  ways to make the best template-host synchronization.</p><p>Gos sighed again, although he did not currently have any  lungs. It was his fault. The mad dreams of revenge, humiliation, and power.  When the truth comes out, would he get the blame, the shame? He had been  forgiven for the template, but that was before the others saw the changes. Much  like fertilizer, the Organic Tech was needed for the seeds to sprout and grow,  but the seeds were of his design. The hacker bitch was simply the gardener.</p><p>With despondent clarity, Gos copied the document,  encrypted it, and set to work at editing the original, giving one last look at  the log before he deleted it. After all, there was a chance that the Organic  Tech would interfere and change things, deviate from the projected path. Even  to Gos, it was a weak excuse.</p><p>End Chapter 7</p><p>Author's Notes: Now I'm not  up to speed on Wyoming law, but in the county I live in Motor Vehicle does send  replacement licenses through the mail. When you change your residency, you give  them your old out-of-state license and they print out a temporary one, then a  few weeks later they mail you the permanent one. Yeah it's goony but that's how  they do it. Now I know some counties, and even whole states, do not do this, in  that you have to go to their offices to pick up your permanent, but those are  usually in the more populated areas. Sweetwater county Wyoming is rather  sparsely populated, even by Wyoming standards.</p><p>Also thanks to my prereaders  Joe Fenton, Jerry Starfire, Black Dragon, Wray, and Jakub.</p><p>These guys have been an  immense help in getting this chapter out.</p>
