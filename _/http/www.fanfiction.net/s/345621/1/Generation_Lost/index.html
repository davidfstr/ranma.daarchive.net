</div><p>Generation Lost</p><p>A R.5 alt by Josh Temple</p><p>Note: in terms of the manga this starts before volume 22  when Ranma has never seen his mother, but because it is and alt fic events past  events will not follow the cannon precisely.</p><p>You know the drill. I don't own Ranma.  Its characters and settings is property of  Rumiko Takahashi.</p><p>To clear up some of the confusions to those who have not  read this story, before Ranma's not mine, neither are the various cameos,  template ideas, or character references.   However the concepts for Clash, templates, imprinting and such are mine;  although, I'm sure someone else had used a similar concept.</p><p>There is a supplemental  list of movie/TV/book references, for all the chapters.</p><p>For those of you  reading this for the first time, you'll have to read on to figure out  what that meant.</p><p>"And so it begins."</p><p>Babylon 5, Season 5 Intro.</p><p>Prolog - Sins of the Father</p><p>"There is a hole in your mind." Babylon 5,  Season 5 Intro</p><p>Ukyou  was bored.  She had been open for about  ten minutes and had yet to get a single customer.  That was strange in and of itself, because  for some reason Tuesdays were one of her busier days.  It had been three weeks since Genma had  died.  Supposedly, the two Saotomes were  on a training trip and Genma had a stroke. Ranma was forced to drag his  father's corpse out of the woods.</p><p>After  the funeral, Ranma ran off.  No one knew  where he was, but it was rumored that he had been seen talking with Cologne  several times.  People assumed that he  had gone off to finish the training trip, or that he was grieving in  private.  Ranma seemed to be in severe  shock.   Hibiki had his own private  theory: Ranma killed his father and ran off to evade capture, but the coroner  had proved that it was a stroke.</p><p>The  front door opened.  "Hi welcome to Uc-" Her greeting cut off when she realized who was  at the door.</p><p>"Hey,  I've got to talk to you." Ranma said, standing in the doorway.</p><p>Ukyou  was taken back not only was Ranma carrying a large backpack, but he also had  spoken in English.  Nearly perfect  English from a person who had slept during all his classes.  "Sure," Ukyou responded in the  same language. "Just turn the sign to 'closed' on your way  in."</p><p>Ranma  sat down on a stool in the front and put his pack down next to him.</p><p>"Why  are you speaking English?" Ukyou asked.</p><p>"Cologne  suggested that I practice," Ranma said, turning around. He was relieved  to see that Ukyou had yet to open the blinds.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I'll  start from the beginning.  You know most  of the story.  It was on one of  Pop's moronic trips. We were sparing and he fell to the ground gasped for  a bit, and then went still.  What I  didn't say was that while I was doing CPR (it was the only thing I could  think of) it started to rain.  I  didn't change."</p><p>"But  I saw your curse activate after you got back," Ukyou interrupted.</p><p>"I  know. Give me a glass of water," Ranma requested, still speaking in  English.  He then poured it on his  hand.  Nothing happened.  "The curse is unstable.  Sometimes water works, sometimes the opposite  temperature works, or sometimes I can change at will."</p><p>"So  you went to Cologne to figure out what happened, and she taught you  English?" Ukyou asked confused.</p><p>"No,  I requested that." Ranma continued, "After I brought Pop back, this  lawyer contacted me about my mother."</p><p>Ukyou  interrupted again, "So you're going to live with her."</p><p>Ranma's  face darkened, "No, she's dead."</p><p>"I'm  sorry."</p><p>"It  was Pop's fault – as usual. Immediately after I was born, he filed  for a divorce.  Apparently my mom  didn't approve of Pop's plans, like a ten year training trip or the  neko-ken.  He somehow got custody.  The attorney didn't go into detail  about it, but it seems that Mom had a very questionable history.  It was all in her past, but he dug it  up.  She was forbidden to see me, and was  forced to flee the country in shame.  As  long as Pop lived, she couldn't contact me in any way, shape, or  form."</p><p>Ukyou  would have been in shock, but considering Genma's plans, the neko-ken,  the ten year training trip, the multiple fiancées and Jusenkyou,  what Genma did was by no means out of character. "Then why are you  learning English, and what about your curse?"</p><p>Ranma  continued, barely maintaining his composure, "She moved to America, got  married, and had a daughter, my sister.   Then two years ago she died in a car accident.  As for my curse, Cologne says it's a  mixture of stress and skill.  A focused  mind can control it. . . like Cologne does.  I never knew she was cursed.  But a stressed one can mess it up.  I'm both. Cologne says that if I got  away from Nerima, I should be able to gain full control."</p><p>"Is  that why you were gone?  And why is she  helping you?"</p><p>"Cologne  was trying to get on my good side.  They're  all more fanatical about getting me, except you."</p><p>Ukyou  turned away.  She had planned to give  Ranma a <i>special</i> meal after the  funeral, in order to <i>cheer</i> him up.</p><p>"I'm  definitely going to see Sarah."</p><p>"So  your question is whether you should come back or not.  How long are you going to be there?"</p><p>Ranma  paused, then said, "No that's not a question at all.'</p><p>Ukyou  looked down.</p><p>"I'm  sorry.   It took me time to realize it, but  there's nothing here for me now."</p><p>The  chef maintained her silence.</p><p>"The  only real friend I have is you and well. . . ." Ranma trailed off.  "Sarah lives in a small town in  Southern Wyoming.  From the calls they  seem like a nice if not particularly odd family."</p><p>"So  do they know about the curse?"</p><p>"Kind-of.  As I said before, stress makes the curse very  random, and I changed during a call."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>"That's  not even half of it.  The lawyer set up a  video conference in his office."</p><p>"Why  did you do that if you were at risk?"</p><p>"I  wanted to see her, and I couldn't keep the curse a secret forever."  Ranma stood up and hefted his pack.  He  pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket, and left it on the counter.  "This is the phone number to the house; please don't tell anyone  else about this."</p><p>Ukyou  watched stunned, as Ranma walked away. "Your English is very good,"  she finally said.</p><p>Ranma  nodded and left the restaurant.</p><p>[End Prolog]</p><p>Chapter 1 - Lockridge</p><p>"What do you want?" Babylon 5, Season 5 Intro.</p><p>Ranma  looked out his window and saw the odd roof to Denver International  Airport.  It looked like a giant white  tarp pulled over a mountain range.  The  plane landed, taxied, and docked. Ranma got out of the seat and took his  pack.  It was his only baggage and contained  all of his possessions.  Ranma was never  really into materialism, but still - to have all your existence boiled down to  one bag.</p><p>Customs  gave a cursory glance at his student visa and passport, and welcomed him to the  United States.  After customs, Ranma went  to the men's room.</p><p>While  using the sink, a faucet broke.  Used to  this kind of thing, Ranma managed to dodge most of the water, avoiding getting  soaked, but not enough to prevent the change.</p><p>Some  were perplexed when they saw a redheaded Japanese girl exit the Men's  room, but no one really commented.  Ranma  looked around the terminal for Sarah's father.  A tall man in sheriff's khakis walked  up to Ranma.  He had dark blue eyes and  short red hair.  "Are you  Ranma?" the Irish cop asked.</p><p>"How  did you know?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Even  if Sarah hadn't mentioned your curse, I'd have known for reasons that will  become apparent when you meet your sister. Come on, let's go to the car."</p><p>Ranma  shook her head, "Don't you find this odd."</p><p>"What,  that my wife's first child changed sex in front of my daughter's  eyes?" the cop smiled. "Sorry to disappoint, but you only rank  within my top dozen, not my top ten weird things. Oh by the way, my  name's Jack O'Neil."</p><p>Ranma  paused at this. That name sounded very familiar.</p><p>O'Neil  smiled, "I have the same name as a character in Stargate SG1. Except my  last name has only one 'L'. You know the circle portal  thing."</p><p>Ranma  nodded.  She had seen the movie.  "Isn't that set in Colorado?"</p><p>"Yup,  Cheyenne Mountain, NORAD." O'Neil said. "But it's more  of a documentary than a cable show."</p><p>Ranma  pondered this as they walked out of the airport.  This guy was weird.  He wasn't even fazed by the curse and  claimed some scifi movie was real.</p><p>In the  parking garage, O'Neil led Ranma to a large jeep with "Lockridge  Sheriff's Department" stenciled on the hood.   O'Neil put Ranma's pack in the  back and opened the passenger door.  The  sheriff got in the driver's seat and drove out of the parking lot.</p><p>"Would  you like to learn about your mother Nodoka?"</p><p>Ranma  nodded.</p><p>During  the five hour drive northwest,  O'Neil  told about how he found Nodoka drifting though town.  They married quickly and shortly thereafter  Sarah was born.  Jack seemed reluctant  for furnish further details about their meeting.</p><p>She was  a good woman, but a part of her soul was destroyed by Genma.  Forbidden to see her first born. He talked  about the 15 years of bliss. About Sarah. ("She looks exactly like you,  Ranma.  You both take after your  mother.)  Then the accident.  A drunken driver plowed into a car driven by  Jean, Jack's sister, with Nodoka in the passenger seat.  Both were killed instantly.  Jack was the apprehending officer.  He noted that the driver had an  'accident' of his own shortly after he met bail.  Some of the stories were fantastic and  bizarre.  Jack was vague, but apparently Lockridge  rivaled Nerima.</p><p>Ranma  described her life - the fiancées the curse. Every time she talked about  Genma's stupidity Jack nodded grimly.</p><p>Lockridge  was a small town nestled in a mountain valley.   O'Neil had two deputies working under him.  Being mid-spring, only the mountain tops had  any snow on them. They were covered with evergreens and huge rocks protruded  from the ground.  Even the center of town  had the feel of the frontier.</p><p>O'Neil  turned down a side road and drove up into the mountains. After going only half  a mile, all signs of human existence were removed, save the road and a set of  power lines.  O'Neil rounded a  corner and stopped in front of a good sized house.  It looked old but well maintained.  When O'Neil shut off the engine, Ranma  heard gunfire.  She looked over to O'Neil  who appeared unconcerned.</p><p>"We'll  drop off you bags and go up to the range," O'Neil said walking up  the steps and onto the porch.</p><p>Ranma  hoisted her pack and followed the sheriff inside.  Walking into the cluttered living room, she  saw some guy asleep on the couch. He opened his eyes and for a split second  Ranma was sure that they were glowing red, but they were a dusty brown.  When he stood up, Ranma got a good look at  him.  He was a Caucasian who bore a  strong resemblance to the sheriff, who appeared to have wandered into the  kitchen.</p><p>He stood  more than a head over Ranma and had spiky brown hair.  "Hey Sarah," he yawned, leaning  back.  He looked blank for a second, then  focused on Ranma. "Wait a minute," he said looking at Ranma's  face and the braided pigtail. "You're not. . .  oh I see.   Hey Ranma.  I'm Dan. Dan  Arzish.  Boy she wasn't kidding  when she said you did that."</p><p>"Did  what?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"The  curse. I mean aren't you supposed to be a guy." Dan yawned and  wandered off, going up the stairs.</p><p>Ranma blinked  and shook her head.  What the  hell's going on around here? Ranma was reminded of when she arrived at  the Tendos.  This was not how people are  supposed to react to seeing a curse like this.   Oh well, at least these people seem nice even if a little odd.  Ranma walked into the kitchen.  Jack was staring out a side window. His hand  had fallen to his sidearm.  He twitched  slightly and turned to Ranma. "I was looking for you.  Come on, let's go up to the range and  talk to Sarah."</p><p>The living  room and the kitchen, both large rooms, made up half of the floor space of the  ground floor.  The living room was in the  front and the kitchen was in the back.   The other half consisted of rooms that Ranma had yet to enter.</p><p>Ranma  went out the back door and onto the large porch that encircled the house.  The house, built into one of the more gentle  regions at the foot of the mountain, had only a half a flight of steeps at the  front of the house with the back nearly at ground level.</p><p>Ranma put her pack next to the door and went  outside.</p><p>Along a  well worn path, O'Neil led Ranma a hundred yards up the slope.   As they walked the sounds of gunfire  increased.  It was in bursts of four or  five shots followed by a pause then another burst.  At the end of the path was a large  clearing.  Graded flat and level, it was  twenty yards wide and went back over two hundred yards into the hillside.  This formed a large bank at the end of the  range and smaller triangular banks among the sides.  A line of stones had been buried flush to the  ground running from one side of the range to another.</p><p>A girl  was standing at this line in a fleece vest and pair of jeans.  Her bright red hair was pulled back in a lose  pony tail.  She had a large shotgun  shouldered.  Her foot touched down on a  pedal resting on the ground.  The pedal  was connected to a simple trap machine.  The  spring loaded arm flung a row of four clay disks.  Each was subjected to different accelerations  and torques and thus each arced at a different angle and inclination.</p><p>She  turned the gun fluidly, precisely, and squeezed the trigger.  Thunder rolled up the mountain.  The lowest target burst into a thousand  particles.  She pumped shotgun and fired  again destroying the next disk.  She  continued racking the weapon, hitting the targets when their trajectory reached  apex.  It was over in seconds.</p><p>She  slung the weapon over her shoulder and turned around. The teleconference's  video was of rather low resolution.  All  Ranma could honestly tell from it was that Sarah was a redhead.</p><p>Now  Ranma could see her face, and aside from having traces of her European heritage  she was nearly identical to Ranma.   Something about that seemed odd.   "How old are you?  I mean  look at us." Ranma said pointing at her own body then at Sarah's.</p><p>O'Neil  decided to speak up, "According to the records you differ by nearly a  year.  Your birthdays are only a week  apart."</p><p>"Remember,  that body of yours is a curse.  What was  it again?" Sarah said.</p><p>"Spring  of drowned girl." Ranma said looking at the range. It made sense but  something else tugged at the back of her mind.   If she was a year older than Sarah, then that means that their mother  was impregnated about three months after her first birth.   That seemed suspiciously fast, especially  for a woman who had been horribly betrayed by the last man she trusted.</p><p>"That  could be it," Sarah said while she put the trap machine in a small shed  of to the side well behind the range line. "I mean the curse could have  set your age back or something."</p><p>Ranma  nodded.  She was looking at a strange  wooden tripod-like device. It sat in its own little range perpendicular to the  main one.  It supported two logs cut  crosswise.  They were about a foot long  and a foot in radius.</p><p>"Like  the hawk blocks?" Sarah said, closing the shed.</p><p>"Huh,"  Ranma said. She then walked up to them.   The faces of the logs were scored with hundreds of linear cuts and rough  notches. It then dawned on her. "Ah, it's for knife  throwing."</p><p>"Or  ax or tomahawk." Sarah added.  She  was lowering a rope tied to the base of a flagpole.  Once the flag was at the base, she tied it  back.  "The flag goes up when the  range is occupied," she told Ranma.</p><p>"I've  got to go back to the station. Be back later tonight." O'Neil said.   He then walked down the path.  A little later, a truck started and drove  off.</p><p>"You  know he really liked you." Sarah said behind Ranma.</p><p>"Yeah  I figured. He's usually very quiet isn't he?"</p><p>"Yup,  even when Mom was around he never talked much."</p><p>"She  really was something wasn't she? I mean you dad spent nearly the whole trip  talking about her."</p><p>Sarah  started down the path. "Come on let's go inside."</p><p>Ranma  followed her.  A month ago he would have  never comprehended this. Oh sure, before the Tendo place, he had been  constantly on the road moving from one place to another, but this was the  furthest.  Out in America, with a half  sister.</p><p>Finding  out that his father had banished his mother.   Sadly it wasn't even one of the worst things that Genma had  done.  Once again he had ditched all that  he had for a new life.  Although now  Ranma was now grateful for those hideous English lessons Cologne had put him  through.  He managed to carry on  functional conversations with both Jack and Sarah.</p><p>Ranma  followed her sister in the house.  Dan  was at the table working on some type of mechanical apparatus.  "Dan, don't to that in the  kitchen," Sarah said.</p><p>"What?  You clean your guns here," Dan said,  hitting the catalytic converter with a pipe wrench.</p><p>"So  do you."</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>Sarah  rubbed her forehead, "Fine.  Could  you clean my gun while I show Ranma her room?"</p><p>"Okay,  but it'll cost you."</p><p>Sarah  racked the shotgun so that its action was open, exposing an empty breach and an  unloaded tube, and handed it over to Dan. "I'll cook dinner."</p><p>Ranma  shook her head and picked up her pack.   As she left the room, she heard Dan mutter under his breath "Damn  twins."  A month ago, Ranma would  have taken offence to that, but that was a different person.  Before, Ranma was macho and swaggering,  hiding behind his ego, a person that was frighteningly similar to his  father.  All that Ranma had was martial  arts.  He didn't have family or  friends. Although he was not sure if he had either now.  He was taking a big risk here.</p><p>"Hey  Ranma?" Sarah asked at the top of the stairs.</p><p>"Huh?"  Ranma said.</p><p>"There's  a bathroom at the head of the stairs." Sarah pointed to a door on the  left.</p><p>Ranma  walked up the narrow staircase.  Sarah  stepped back.  Ranma walked into the open  bathroom.  Using the sink she tried the  hot water first then the cold no change.</p><p>"The  curse is probably still unstable.  Could  be jet lag?"</p><p>Ranma  nodded.  She was still really groggy even  though she slept during the entire flight.</p><p>"Okay,"  Sarah continued.  "You said that  sometimes you can change at will."</p><p>"Yeah,"  Ranma said stepping out of the bathroom.</p><p>"Come  on I'll show you your room."</p><p>Ranma  followed Sarah to the guest room at the end of the hall.  Sarah opened the door to a nondescript bed  room.  Ranma put his pack on the bed.</p><p>"Is  this fine?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"Sure.  Why'd you ask about the curse?"</p><p>"Oh,"  Sarah said, glancing out the window.   "It's just that being in a new location, the curse might  have to adapt to local magics."</p><p>"But  my curse had been acting up since. . . . Wait, are there curses and stuff here  too."</p><p>"Nope.   No curses per say, but weird things do  happen," Sarah dodged.  "But  I wouldn't be surprised.  You said  that a focused mind could control the curse."</p><p>"To  a degree."</p><p>"Then  sit here," Sarah said pulling the pack off the bed.</p><p>Ranma  complied sitting in the lotus position.</p><p>"Now try to clear you  mind.  Reach out; you should be able to  tap into an energy well."</p><p>Ranma  felt a tingling grow inside his skull, like a strong electric current.</p><p>"Now  link it to your curse.  That's  it.  Use it to revert back," Sarah  said keeping her voice strangely flat.</p><p>Ranma  diverted the flux.  It touched his curse  and the change happened.  Ranma felt the  familiar shift and turned.  He opened his  eyes and looked at Sarah.  She was  nodding. "What?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"You're  good," Sarah stated, making several mental notes.</p><p>"I  am a martial artist, you know." Ranma said stretching his arms.</p><p>"True,  come on.  I've got to get dinner  ready."  Sarah left the room.</p><p>Ranma  sat for a second and pondered.  When  Cologne tried to teach him to change at will, there was no stream, no flux.  Maybe this was just the first time he noticed it, but how did Sarah know?  Ranma remembered that he had to be careful  until he adjusted.  He had no intention  of screwing up like he did at the Tendo's.  Ranma stood up.  Wandering down the hall, he noticed that the  lights were recessed in the corners where the walls met the ceiling.</p><p>Ranma  walked into the kitchen.  Dan's  engine part, or whatever it was, was gone and in its place was Sarah's  gun.  He had the thing disassembled, and  was running clean patches through the barrel.   Dan looked up. "Hey.  So you're  back to your old self. Pull up a chair and we'll spin a yarn."</p><p>"Shut  up," Sarah said from the stove where she had started cooking in some kind  of pot. "We aren't a bunch of hicks, Ranma."</p><p>"Okay,"  Ranma said.  The smell from the pot was  very familiar. "Ramen," he guessed.</p><p>Sarah  nodded.  "Yup.  Foods just about the only thing Mom taught me  that was even remotely oriental."</p><p>Ranma  sat down.  Come to think of it, there was  no trace of anything Japanese in the house, except the food.  But then, Nodoka had no reason to feel  obligated to the country of her birth.</p><p>Dan  finished cleaning the gun, reassembled it, and walked out of the room. He came  back a couple minutes later, sans gun.   He  started setting the table for three persons.   "Oh Sarah, Jack called. He'll be staying late tonight, so he  won't be here for dinner."</p><p>Sarah  nodded and continued to cook the food.</p><p>Dan  turned to Ranma, "So, you gonna tell us about all your zany adventures?"</p><p>"What  about you guys?" Ranma asked.   "I mean Mr. O'Neil made it seem that this place had its  share of oddities."</p><p>"Just  call him Jack, everyone does."  Dan  continued, "Well some things have happened, but Jack is known for  embellishment."</p><p>Ranma  looked at Sarah who had remained silent.   Even if Jack was little odd, Ranma didn't think that he was the  type to say anything other than the truth.   Then again, it wasn't like anyone around here was anything but  odd, himself included.  Ranma decided to  give it time, and not rush things.</p><p>Ranma  had also come to realize that he was always putting his foot in his mouth. If  he told about his life, he could prattle on and not risk asking the wrong  questions.  So when dinner was served, he  gave his life's story.</p><p>Dan and  Sarah listened, nodding in all the right places, but something was off.  It was almost as if they had heard this story  before. Well maybe not this story exactly, but this type of story.  The ramen even tasted identical to what  Shampoo would make.  And one thing was  still bugging him.</p><p>"Why  did Mom stop in this town? What was she even doing in Wyoming?"</p><p>Sarah  glanced at Dan. "We were planning on taking you to the place where Mom  met Dad after school tomorrow, and tell you what brought her here," she  explained</p><p>"School?  Yeah I guess I need to go," Ranma muttered to himself, then aloud,  "But why don't you tell the story now, and how come you're  not surprised at all by my life."</p><p>Dan  spoke up, "Well we're kind of in the same situation.  Do you know why I'm here in this  house?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"I'm  Sarah's cousin.  My dad died of  cancer many years ago."</p><p>It took  Ranma a few seconds to get it.  There was  another person in the car with Nodoka. "So both your parents are dead too."</p><p>Dan  nodded.</p><p>"Okay  Dan.  I cooked, you clean," Sarah  said.</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>Sarah  stood up, "Ranma, want to see the rest of the place?"</p><p>"Why  not," Ranma said.  Having something  to relate to with these people made it easier to accept the warnings in the  back of his mind.</p><p>There  were two rooms that Ranma had not seen on the first floor.  The room that used to be a dinning room now  stored a couple server banks, miscellaneous computer equipment, and storage  boxes. A cavernous sunken den was set up to be an entertainment center.  A door in the den lead to a two bay  garage.  The rear of the garage held an  extensive metal shop. One of the bays was empty, presumably for Jack's  Jeep.</p><p>The  other held what used to be a late eighties Suburban.  The huge truck had been modified extensively,  and according to Sarah, all the work had been done by Dan himself.  The truck had a lift kit, brush guards rear  and front, step up running boards, wide all terrain tires, fog lamps, light  rack, winch, heavy dual exhaust pipes, custom suspension and shocks, tinted  windows, and god only knew what Dan did to the engine, for the hood had  multiple intake scoops mounted in it.</p><p>Ranma  walked up to the vehicle.  Its semi-gloss  black paint seemed to move and swirl. The truck had overpowering presence.</p><p>Sarah  stood next to Ranma, "It's almost as if it's alive."</p><p>Ranma  nodded looking at his reflection in the inky surface.</p><p>"He  calls it 'the Beast.' Go ahead, touch it."</p><p>The  pigtailed martial artist placed his palm on the hood.  The metal under seemed to vibrate and squirm.  Ranma pulled his hand back, unsettled.</p><p>"Cool  isn't it.  Dan spent three years  building this thing.  A year longer than  he's been driving.  He's  spent so much time with it, it's almost as if part of his soul is in  it."</p><p>Ranma  eyed the truck.  It was beautiful; an  achievement in manufacturing, engineering, and art, but still there was a  definite sense of wrongness to it.  Sarah  took Ranma back into the den and turned off the lights.  Ranma turned to see the truck melt into the  darkness.</p><p>The  upstairs held four bedrooms and two baths.   One of the bathrooms was in the master bedroom, leaving one bathroom for  Ranma, Sarah, and Dan.   The bedrooms  were what Ranma expected them to be.   Dan's was cluttered with papers, books, and random metal  components.  Sarah's was reasonably  neat, and except for the weapons, ammo, and trophy heads, it was much like a  normal teenage girl's room.   Jack's was pressboard neat, with very minimalist furniture.  Each bedroom had its own homebuilt computer,  and was LAN'ed to the servers in what used to be the dinning room.</p><p>After  the tour, Sarah went to the server room to fix a broken tower.  As he watched, Ranma was given a lecture on  the basics of computers.  Dan was apparently  in the garage working.  Jack came home,  said his hellos and had some leftover ramen in the den.</p><p>Soon,  he was joined by Dan.  Ranma then  followed Sarah into the room.  The TV was  on, and Ranma sat himself down next to Sarah on the big couch.  Dan and Jack were both sitting in easy chairs  that flanked the couch.  They watched a  strange show where small robots and a big dopey guy from Wisconsin made fun of  excruciatingly bad movies.  Some of it  was very funny, and Ranma guessed that he would have gotten the rest, but the  jokes were rooted heavily in Americana.   After three of the movies. Everyone scattered, and eventually went to  bed.</p><p>While  Ranma prepared for bed, he brooded on his new family, eventually falling asleep.   Dan and Sarah were in their own rooms,  having a conversation via the LAN. Jack linked in and out to make occasional  observations, but stayed silent.</p><p>Eventually  the two reached an agreement.  Ranma had  the potential and the skill. Tomorrow they would show him the standing ring.</p><p>[End Chapter 1]</p>
