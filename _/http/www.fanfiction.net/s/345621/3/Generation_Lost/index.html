</div><p>Chapter 3 - Technical Support</p><p>"Nothing's the same anymore." Babylon 5, Season 5 Intro.</p><p>Ranma awoke  in the upper bunk bed.  She glanced over  the edge to see Sarah sleeping in the lower bunk.  No one had told Ranma that she needed to  sleep in female form. Ranma and Sarah were brother and sister, technically half  siblings, but that didn't matter.</p><p>Ranma  had lost what had been, for a short time, his room so Allison could sleep  there.  It was a symbolic gesture,  designed to appease Allison's parents.   If Allison and Dan wanted to get frisky, nothing could really stop them,  especially given Allison's ability to turn invisible.</p><p>This  bunk bed had a lower bunk running perpendicular to the upper bunk. Ranma jumped  off the upper bunk, got dressed, and walked out of the room.  She knocked on the bathroom door. "Just a  minute!" Allison shouted over the shower.</p><p>"Never  mind," Ranma said then headed down the stairs.</p><p>Jack  was sitting in the living room reading a newspaper. "Hey Ranma," he said  without looking up.</p><p>At the  foot of the stairs she asked, "How'd you know it was me?"</p><p>"I have  my ways," the sheriff said, turning the page.</p><p>"I'm  really sick of people saying that."</p><p>"Sorry  to hear about your template."</p><p>"Have  any suspects," Ranma asked, looking for the downstairs bathroom.</p><p>"Not my  jurisdiction."</p><p>"Whoever  did this tried to kill us,"</p><p>"Read  the town charter," Jack said still reading. "I'll help when the time's right,"  he said in the grim tone of a man caught between duty and honor.</p><p>Ranma  shrugged and went to find the bathroom.   It was adjacent to the den, near the kitchen, and tucked away.  Ranma tried the faucets first.  She managed to change back with hot  water.  Her curse seemed to have  stabilized, at least for now, and was back to the standard triggers.</p><p>Ranma  exited the bathroom and went into the kitchen.   Dan was sitting at the table.  He  had a pot of coffee in front of him, with a straw sticking out.  The pot was half gone and he had a glazed  look to his eyes.</p><p>Actually  Ranma wasn't sure, considering he'd never seen Dan when he wasn't sleeping,  pulling an all-nighter, or looked half baked.</p><p>"Hey  it's the Ran-Man," Dan said before falling face first on the table. "Ouch," he  said in a little too mellow voice.</p><p>Sarah  wearing slacks, a blouse, and her vest walked into the room, took a swig of  coffee, then put the pot back down. "You are an idiot," she said slowly to her  cousin, then turned to Ranma. "We're going to have some problems unless we can  get wonder boy here to wake up," she said pointing to Dan's now sleeping form.</p><p>"What  did he do?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"He  just stayed up all night getting a project essay done, but that's not the worst  of it, if he can't drive us to school. . ." Sarah trailed off when Allison  entered the room.</p><p>Allison  done with bathing and had dressed in her normal clothes, that is to say,  revealing yet not cheap.  Well not <i>t  hat</i> cheap. "You know, Dan, you  shouldn't do this every night. It's bad for you-" Allison's stern lecture fell  short when she realized what Dan's present state meant. She stopped looked at  her sleeping boyfriend then at the coffee pot, and then ran out of the room.</p><p>Ranma  heard the garage door slam shut. "Is she really that bad?" he asked, not  wanting to know the answer.</p><p>"Worse.  It's not that she can't drive, actually yes it is. I mean she's almost a good  as Dan is when it comes to mechanics, but put her in the driver's seat, and  well -" Sarah rambled off.</p><p>"So  what do we do?"</p><p>"You  can't stop her...  unless <i>you</i> want to try."</p><p>Ranma  remembered the maniacal glint Allison possessed, "Um, not particularly."  He then looked at Dan's comatose body, "So  what do we do with him?"</p><p>"Help  me drag him to the Beast."</p><p>Dan  woke up.  He felt nauseous and had a  splitting headache.  It almost felt as if  his brains were being ground up. Wait, that wasn't his brains. It was his  truck. OH NO.</p><p>Dan  bolted up, or tried to; he was secured in the front passenger seat by his belt.  "Allison," he said grinding his teeth. "Why are you driving my truck? You know  I love you but, YOU DO NOT DRIVE MY TRUCK!"</p><p>Dan  unclipped his belt and lunged over to pull the key out when it hit him.  The truck sounded normal, a bit strained, but  normal and otherwise fine. "Um sorry, but when did you start to drive  competently?"</p><p>"Oh  that," Allison said shifting into a higher gear, "I've been practicing at my  parents house."</p><p>Dan  nodded.   Allison was driving a bit slow,  only twenty over the speed limit, but she had shifted into the right gear, and  was handing the Beast reasonably well. Considering the engine under the hood of  the black tuck, that was an accomplishment for even a normal driver, let alone  Allison. "Why'd they let you drive?  I  mean you're a great mechanic, but you backed into a tree." Dan paused then  added, "Repeatedly."</p><p>Meanwhile,  Ranma was relaxing in the back.  Allison  was still going way too fast, but at least they had yet to go airborne.</p><p>Sarah  was sitting next to Ranma working on a laptop. She was humming.</p><p>"What  are you doing?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Researching  on Spore," she replied.</p><p>"Oh the  German guy who wrote my template."</p><p>"That's  the one," she said then resumed humming. "Except he's not German."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"I  traced back those files that Sean was storing.   The German account was just that, another account, another storage  site." Sarah then hummed a few more bars, "So I searched the billing list as to  who paid for the drive space."</p><p>"Who?"  Ranma inquired, pondering the song.  It  was vary familiar.</p><p>"A  Japanese software company."</p><p>"Oh  crap."</p><p>"Yup!  seems like one of your old 'pals' has a sick  sense of humor."</p><p>"The  software company may be just another shell," Dan said, watching Allison drive.</p><p>"Too  much of a coincidence," Sarah said then started humming again.</p><p>Ranma  nodded. That song was really getting annoying. It almost sounds like the  opening to. . . .</p><p>"Hey!"  Ranma said indignant.</p><p>"Took  you long enough," Sarah said grinning.</p><p>"Isn't  that the theme song to Sailor Moon?" Allison asked.</p><p>"Eyes  on the road," Dan warned.</p><p>Ranma  fumed.</p><p>"Lighten  up. I mean you can hum the theme to Mech Warrior."</p><p>"Or the  Matrix."</p><p>"Or  Invisible Man."</p><p>"Or the  Terminator."</p><p>"Or  Stargate."</p><p>"Yeah,  but you guys chose your templates and you can still edit yours," Ranma said.</p><p>"True.  That does suck." Sarah said.</p><p>"But a  least you've got some serious power," Dan said.</p><p>"You  can fly too," Allison added.</p><p>Ranma  grumbled.</p><p>The  Beast pulled into the school parking lot. "Very  good," Dan said as Allison put the truck into park and pulled out the  keys.  Getting out of the truck, he said,  "Okay Allison and I have all of our classes together, and you two have all of  yours together," Dan told Ranma and Sarah also out of the truck.</p><p>"So did  you get put ahead a year?" Ranma asked. After all he was a year older.</p><p>"Not  exactly," Sarah said grabbing her pack and starting to walk to school.</p><p>Ranma  thought about this, "I got sent back a year?"</p><p>"Yeah.  Despite coming from a school that you had to take an entrance exam to get into,  the administration here decided to drop you back.  They had some points. Our school years start  at different times. It also seems that your grades weren't all that hot. Then  again, they could have done it just because they could. I mean, there's this  one VP that's a real pain." Dan said flatly.</p><p>"Well  it's not that I couldn't do the work. I just don't care," Ranma responded.</p><p>"You're  preaching to the choir," Dan said.</p><p>Ranma  approached the door to the school, "Wait, the hacker that did this to me is  most likely a student here right?"</p><p>"That's  why I'm suggesting we stay in teams of two," Dan said approaching the door.</p><p>The  Lady in Shadows sat in the student lounge working.  This time, she was not alone.  About a dozen other students were in the  lounge, most of them working on laptops similar to hers.  A few even had I/O spheres out.  She had hers set on long range scan.</p><p>It  started when she replayed what the golem sent out before being destroyed. She  found that Sarah's twin was named Ranma, and when she correlated it with school  records, she found a Ranma, but this person was male.</p><p>Further  examinations of the broadcast, revealed two things: first, in the hands of a  skilled user, that template was very powerful; second her toy had some other  programs.  The conversation in the  standing circle refereed to a sex changing curse.  She then researched the name they had used:  Jusenkyou.  Apparently it was a water  triggered curse.</p><p>This  made the repercussions of the imprint even more amusing.  The intentions of the Lady in Shadows were  not that malicious  If Ranma ever got the  decryption key, he'd have a good chance of removing a good part of the  code.</p><p>Wizards  and such are generally a laid back bunch, but they suffer from the same malady  of immortals and other beings of power, boredom.  So they spend their time finding activities  that they find interesting or entertaining.</p><p>Granted  the lady does have sick sense of humor and that she'll play puppet master just  for a few laughs doesn't mean she's evil. Wait yes, yes it does, but at least  she's no megalomaniac demon from an alternate dimension bent on global  domination.</p><p>Given  her intentions, what she did to the school's computer system was no surprise,  even though it was a simple trick.</p><p>Ranma  was following Sarah, walking towards the doors when he heard something.  A familiar noise, the sound of sprinklers  about to go off. Ranma tried to dodge, but for some reason he could never dodge  water very well whether it was from a ladle, puddle, or sprinkler.</p><p>Jets of  water came out covering the lawn and a certain martial artist.  From inside the foyer Dan and Allison watched  Ranma get soaked. "Ranma wasn't kidding when he said he was a water magnet,"  she commented.</p><p>Dan  nodded.</p><p>Sarah  was standing by the door, "Come on in," she told Ranma.</p><p>Ranma  walked in completely soaked. Her shirt was quite clingy. She was grumbling  something.</p><p>"That  was odd," Sarah said.</p><p>"Nah  it's just my curse. This kind of crap always happens to me."</p><p>From  the guardrail of the student lounge, Ned Winston saw Sarah O'Neil enter the  school followed by a soaking wet girl that looked just like her. He then walked  up to the lady in shadows, "Hey Rebecca, you know Sarah had a twin?"</p><p>Rebecca  looked up from her laptop, "Heard she's her long lost sister from Japan,"</p><p>Ned  nodded, "Makes sense.  I mean, Sarah is  half Japanese. Although the sprinklers seemed to have hit her, odd."</p><p>Rebecca  raised an eyebrow at Ned.</p><p>"Yes  fine, that wasn't that odd at all.  It  was probably just a prank," Ned, sensing awkwardness, grabbed his bag and left  the lounge.</p><p>Rebecca  sighed.  The only reason she put up with  Winston at all was his ability to create golems; magically enhanced  robots.  Ned had that right mix of  programming talent and engineering aptitude to excel in the field. They had  worked out a little agreement, he gave her the occasional bot and she kept him  supplied with certain hard to find raw materials.</p><p>"Well  this sucks," Ranma said still in female form.</p><p>"What?"  Sarah asked leading him to the next class.</p><p>"Let's  see - a good portion of the school saw me transform."</p><p>"I  don't think so. I was standing right at the doors and I didn't see anyone out  there, and no one from the lounge could see where you were standing."</p><p>"True,"  Ranma said pondering. "So now what?"</p><p>"You  should just go on in."</p><p>Ranma  looked at the knob. Inhaled, grabbed and turned. She stepped into a classroom.  At lest she though it was one.  Her  experience with classrooms were close to the rigid grid of desks that dated  back to the fifty's.  This room had a  white board that ran along one wall, a cluttered teacher's desk in a corner, a  bunch of chairs and tables in the center of the room, and running the other  three walls were numerous computer stations.</p><p>The  teacher, a well rested looking middle aged man, walked up to the near twins.  "I'm Mr. Jones and you must be the new girl Ranma," he said, and then wandered  back to his desk.</p><p>"Um,  yeah." Ranma said unsure.  "What's going  on here?" she whispered to her sister.</p><p>"Most  of the teachers are pretty laid back.  I  mean they have to be.  They're teaching a  bunch of people that have some pretty heavy powers.  The only way you can stay sane around here is  to go with the flow.  But Jones is the  most apathetic; then again he's been here the longest out of the entire staff."</p><p>"No,  not that.  Why did he call me a girl?"</p><p>"There  is the family resemblance," Sarah suggested.</p><p>"No,  that's not it.  We'd have different last  names on the roster, yet he knew mine" Ranma had a bad feeling about this.</p><p>"Um,  the records could be wonky.  Come on  let's sit down," Sarah said leading Ranma to a computer station in the back.</p><p>Ranma  saw about an eighteen other students, most of whom were asleep. He then sat  down in a seat next to Sarah, who had just turned on one of the computers.</p><p>Mr.  Jones shuffled to the front of the room.   "Alright class. Come on you lazy bastards, I only require you to listen  to me once a day, so Wake Up!" he said clenching his teeth.</p><p>About a  third of the class woke up blinked at Mr. Jones and fell back asleep; the rest  maintained consciousness, but were apathetic and slothful.</p><p>"Close  enough," Mr. Jones muttered. Then in a dry monotone "Anyway your projects are  due Friday, not that any of you care. We have a new student.  The damp one next to Sarah. That's it. I'll  be sleeping." He then shuffled to his chair, put his feet on his desk and went  to sleep.</p><p>Ranma  found this surprising.  She never had a  teacher that did not at least pretend to care.   She looked at the rest of the class. Some were still sleeping, while the  others had shifted to computers.  "What's  with this place?"</p><p>"Nearly  all the classes here are self paced," Sarah said. "It would be a futile to try  and force any of us to do daily work. Even the people with limited potential  and skill are too independent to be 'normalized' by public school. This must be  really weird considering the uniform wearing, teacher respecting, hard work  grinding, and pointless task completing regimenting of Japanese schools."</p><p>"That's  an extreme interpretation."</p><p>"But an  accurate one. Right?"</p><p>Ranma  shrugged, he turned to see a girl standing behind her. She was rather average  with long brown hair pulled back in a lose braid.</p><p>"Hey  Sarah?" she asked. "I didn't know you had a twin," she said gesturing at Ranma.</p><p>"Ranma's  not my twin Julie," Sarah said typing, "Technically, she's my half brother."</p><p>"Huh?"  Julie said, confused by the conflicting pronouns.</p><p>"We  share a mother.  You see when his father  died, he moved over here. Now the reason he looks like, well, me is that he's  got this weird curse."</p><p>"Oh is  it a virus or corrupt coding?"</p><p>"I  think it's a little of both, although it wasn't written in Calash."</p><p>"Have  you tried removing it?"</p><p>"Oh the  uninstall is easy, but it won't be taken out right now."</p><p>"Alright  then," Julie said then walked off.</p><p>"It's  not that I don't mind it, but no one's freaked out by the curse," Ranma said  slightly confused.</p><p>"Granted  there aren't too many sex altering applets floating around, but a couple of  people have them."</p><p>"So  what class is this?"</p><p>"Um - English?"</p><p>"Wait -  you don't know?" Ranma asked.  God, the  teachers were lax here, which is a good thing.</p><p>"Well  all he does is give us long range writing projects, and then grades them  ruthlessly."</p><p>Ranma  shook her head.</p><p>"So why don't you get some hot water?"</p><p>"My clothes  are still wet.  I'll just change right  back."</p><p>"Yes, I  see," Sarah said looking at Ranma's shirt. "You really should wear a bra when  you're in that form."</p><p>Ranma  glared at her sister.</p><p>"Sorry,  but I've got 'em too."</p><p>Rebecca  checked the remote connection to her O/I sphere.  She linked the device to what used to be a  cell phone and made a wireless connection between it and her laptop.  She didn't want to leave the sphere alone,  but she had to distance herself from her toy, and the work she planned was far  too precise for the sphere's long range broadcast settings.</p><p>When  she found out about her toy's curse, she began making a little upgrade for  Ranma's template.  Part of it was a  program she had used before and required only minimal editing to suit her  needs. The rest was a little set of programs she picked up, but had yet to  test.  Rebecca even found a way to  compensate for the fact that the template could not function at all when Ranma  was male.</p><p>Now all  she had to do was wait.</p><p>Ranma  grumbled.  She was once again  female.  Just before lunch her clothes  had dried enough to allow her to switch back, and then when they walked back  from a restaurant near the school, the sprinklers hit him again.</p><p>At  least students were allowed to eat off school grounds. Ranma sighed pulling at  her damp again clothes.  Tomorrow, she  would bring another set to change into. "So this is the physics room."</p><p>"Yup,"  Sarah replied working on a miniature Tesla coil.</p><p>Ranma  looked around the room.  Half the class  was helping the teacher, a black-suited Mr. Smith, build some sort of  contraption, while the rest of the class built other smaller machines. White  boards were covered with descriptions of Gaussian surfaces, Ampereian loops,  and other things that Ranma didn't understand. The room looked very much like a  mad scientist's lair or a least a slightly perturbed grad student's lab.</p><p>During  lunch, Sarah checked the school records and found out that someone had changed  Ranma's sex to female.  Sarah remarked  that this was another prank done by the same person that imprinted Ranma. Sarah  fixed the settings, but considering how easy is was to get in the records, it  could be switched back rather easily.</p><p>Ranma  was bored and tired.  All she wanted to  do was take a little nap, and for once in her scholarly career, no one would  stop her. Ranma put her head down on the workbench and fell asleep.</p><p>"Ranma  give me some more copper wire," Sarah said.   When she failed to get a response, she looked over to see her sister  fast asleep.</p><p>"Fine,  be that way." Sarah went back to work.</p><p>A few  minutes later she stopped, and walked out to go to the bathroom.</p><p>Rebecca  observed all this from the security camera she compromised.  Her patience had paid off. Ranma was asleep  and would be unaware of the edit, and Sarah, who might have been able to tell  something was amiss, was out of the room.</p><p>Being  in study hall, she had no concerns of being interrupted, but she had to act  fast.  She linked the sphere to Ranma's template,  and got the standard: "Program locked. Please enter edit code or software will  be read only."</p><p>Rebecca  typed in "noops_wraith_alpha_coMSYS_threve_56,"  and gained full access to the template.   She then loaded her upgrade package which self extracted into the  template.  After checking to see that the  installation was successful, she went into the template's history and deleted  any record of the installation.  She  wanted it to look like the new code had always been there. Included in the  package were some power limiters.  Now if  it looked like her toy was about to find and attack her, Rebecca had a way to  remedy that situation.</p><p>Satisfied  with her work, Rebecca disconnected with the template.  She would pick up her sphere after  school.  She continued to watch through  the secure-cam to see how much extra time she had, before Sarah returned or  Ranma awoke.  It was about two minutes.</p><p>Sarah  came back into the class room to see Ranma still asleep. "Lazy fool," she said,  sitting back down and going back to work on her Tesla coil.</p><p>Sean  Reno was at his computer, trying to contact Spore.  He had some rather bad news.  Sean knew that this was the chat room that  Spore normally hung around.  All he had  to do was wait.</p><p>[Spore has signed on  15:23 GMT]</p><p>Spore: hello forge</p><p>Germ_Forge: y34h \/\/e h4v3 t0  t4[k</p><p>Spore: damn man dont go into that  l33t crap now</p><p>Germ_Forge: sorry can we talk in  private</p><p>[5 users have been removed from discussion group]</p><p>Spore: Remember this is my domain</p><p>Germ_Forge: true</p><p>Spore: what do you have to say</p><p>Germ_Forge: remember the hacker  that stole those files i was storing for you</p><p>Spore: yes</p><p>Germ_Forge: that bitch imprinted  this new girl</p><p>Spore: so</p><p>Germ_Forge: she and her friends  are pissed</p><p>Spore: so</p><p>Germ_Forge: they are looking for  you and the hacker</p><p>Spore: so they do not know where i  am</p><p>Germ_Forge: neither do I but you  should be prepared</p><p>Spore: true okay give me a description</p><p>Germ_Forge: japanese  girl about 16 short well endowed with bright red hair and she's got a twin  sister</p><p>[30 seconds pass without a response]</p><p>Germ_Forge: spore whats wrong</p><p>Spore: describe the template</p><p>Germ_Forge: short skirt  ribbons and bows  angel wings</p><p>Spore: not good</p><p>Germ_Forge: what</p><p>Spore: i have to go now but we  will talk later</p><p>Gosunkugi  Hikaru disconnected from the forum, and looked at his monitor blankly.</p><p>"Well  you're screwed," a girl's voice said.</p><p>Gosunkugi  turned to his other computer monitor. On the screen was a girl that looked  about his age.  She had dark blue, medium  length hair and was wearing black tights, a black blouse, and a short chainmail  skirt.  She was an extremely lifelike 3d  rendering.</p><p>"Thanks  for pointing out the obvious Erika."</p><p>"Why  did you make all those templates in the first place?  I mean Shampoo, Akane, Ukyou, Ranma's girl  side. Oh wait - I see," the computer generated girl glared at the pale teen.</p><p>"It's  not like I have any magical skills. I mean, look at how pathetic I was with  voodoo."</p><p>"But  you're actually good with Calash; some of those were almost fully functional  templates."</p><p>"With  Calash, anyone can write the programs, but only a select few can actually  execute them.  I have no latent  potential, so I thought they'd never be used.   They were just practice."</p><p>"But  you made me," Erika offered.</p><p>"No I  didn't.  All I did was hack into and  link, the best experimental AI's. You were just a fluke."</p><p>"But  here I am," Erika said pointing to herself.</p><p>"No,  the only thing 'here' is you input/output feed and your graphical interface.  The rest of 'you' is still on over a dozen  campuses and corporate labs.  The only  reason you haven't been taken apart yet is that you've hidden your existence to  your true creators."</p><p>"But I  can pass any turning test and am the culmination of the top minds in artificial  intelligence."</p><p>"But  all I did was highjack their work."</p><p>"So  you're a really good hacker that made a simulated girlfriend," Erika said.</p><p>"That's  too creepy is it?"</p><p>"Well  not creepy.  Is pathetasad a word?" Erika  offered.</p><p>"I  don't know.  Is sarcastabitch  a word?"</p><p>Erika  laughed "Okay fine.  So what do we do  about Ranma?"</p><p>"Well,  you try to find out why he left, and where he is now."</p><p>"Why  don't you ask his friends?"</p><p>"Um, at  school I'm considered the quiet background person.  They'd get real suspicious if I started  asking where Ranma was considering that they have yet to find him."</p><p>"And  what'll you do?"</p><p>"I'll  get as much as I can about that hacker."</p><p>"Why do  you trust that drunk?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"When I  found out about Germ Forge, I traced back to his real name, then did a  government search on him."</p><p>"And  what did you find out?"</p><p>"Drunken  disorderly."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"He's a  bad person."</p><p>"Look  Erika, he's my friend. He was the one how gave me an I/O sphere and the Calash  compiler."</p><p>"And  why did he do this?" she asked skeptically.</p><p>"Well,  I cleared up some tax problems he had."</p><p>"I told  you he was bad news."</p><p>"Why  don't you like him?"</p><p>"He let  someone get in to his system and take files he was watching for a friend."</p><p>"That  wasn't his fault."</p><p>"Yes it  was."</p><p>Gosunkugi  sighed.  It wasn't like their own systems  were totally secure. That was one of the reasons he had moved some of his  archives to Forge's servers.  "Look, I  think I've got a plan, but we need more information."</p><p>"All right  I'll do it."</p><p>"That's  my girl."</p><p>"I  thought you said I wasn't real."</p><p>"That's  part of my plan too."</p><p>Erika  looked quizzically at Gosunkugi.</p><p>"So  what do you think of school?" Sarah asked while she was getting ready for bed.</p><p>"It's  good, but weird.  I mean everything is a  long term project," Ranma said, striping down to her boxers and a t-shirt.</p><p>"Yeah,  but don't think it's not hard.  It's real  easy not to do your project until the last moment, like Dan does," Sarah said  getting into bed. "And you still don't have to sleep as a girl."</p><p>"I  know, but it seems weird to sleep in a girl's room as a guy."</p><p>"Eh, Lockridge  is pretty easy going by modern standards, don't worry about it." Sarah said.              "Hum," Ranma said, not listening.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Ever  think that Spore and that hacker are in cahoots, or even the same person?  I mean it's way to convenient that someone  from Japan makes a template of my girl, side then stores that template with  someone who just happens to live in Lockridge."</p><p>"You  may have a point.  We'll check it out  tomorrow," Sarah said turning off the lights, "Goodnight Ranma"</p><p>"Yeah,  night," Ranma said, quickly falling asleep. Rebecca's supplemental programming  activated, and the dreams began.</p><p>[End Chapter 3]</p><p>Author's Note: This is a short chapter; it's mostly setup  for the next one.</p><p>Very Special thanks to Joe Fenton, who has been instrumental  in the revision of the first half of Generation Lost.  I would also like to point out my rage  against the evils of the comma.</p>
