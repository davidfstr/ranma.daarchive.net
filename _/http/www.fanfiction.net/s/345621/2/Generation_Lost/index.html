</div><p>Chapter 2 - Any sufficiently advanced technology. . .</p><p>"No one here is exactly what he appears." Babylon  5, Season 5 Intro.</p><p>Ranma  woke up. Getting out of the bed he noticed the silence.   Walking to the window he looked out.  Tree after tree stretched out until they  blocked the view. After dressing, Ranma went down the stairs.  He looked out a front window just in time to  see Jack's jeep speed down the driveway.</p><p>"Sorry  'bout that there was an accident on the highway a county over, jack-knifed  trailer," Sarah said, with slight worry. She was wearing the same blue vest she  had on yesterday. Under it she had on a green scoop neck dress. Her hair was  unbound and rested freely.</p><p>Ranma  looked at his sister. She was almost and exact duplicate of his girl side.</p><p>"You  know bro. If you weren't family or didn't have a body like this too."</p><p>The  martial artist pulled back.  "I guess I  was staring," he thought.</p><p>"If you  want to.  I could give you some of my  clothes. I'm sure they'll fit."</p><p>Ranma  backed off confused.</p><p>"Lighten  up man," Sarah said grinning. "Come on we've got breakfast."</p><p>Ranma  then followed his sister into the kitchen.   Dan was sitting in at the table drinking a large cup of coffee.  He looked worn out, but strangely enthused.  "Jack left pretty late."</p><p>"Um but  it's morning. Right?" Ranma said, sleep had helped, but he still had a little  jet lag.</p><p>"Crap!"  Dan said jumping up to his feet. "At least I'm done."</p><p>"You  finished.   I was wondering how long does  it take to rebuild a V-10," Sarah said.</p><p>Dan  grinned.</p><p>Sarah's  eyes widened. "Good god no, you didn't."</p><p>"What  did he do?" Ranma asked Sarah.</p><p>"I'll  show you," Dan said rushing off to the den.</p><p>Sarah  shrugged, and they both  followed Dan to  the garage.  The hood was open to the  beast and the garage door was up.  Tubes  ran from the exhaust pipes and out the door.   "Come on in, don't step on the hoses.   After that first test I realized that I had to add some type of extended  regulator.  A normal muffler and cat-back  won't handle this baby," Dan said pointing to the inside of the engine  compartment.</p><p>"No,  no, no," Sarah was softly chanting.</p><p>Ranma  looked at the engine.  It was some type  of heavy cylinder that hat several leads and conduits running from it.  "What is it?"</p><p>"A  helicopter crashed last winder during a snowstorm.  It went up for salvage.  Dan bought the engine.  Dad let him keep it.  Sure, Dan's a genius mechanic, but  come-on.  It's a damn chopper  engine.  You told us that you were just  reconditioning the old engine," Sarah said.</p><p>Dan  shrugged and walked over to the driver side door. Using the step-up Dan slid  into the cockpit. He fished out a key from his pocket.  Dan slid it into the ignition. Pushed down on  the accelerator, checked to make sure it was in neutral.  He then turned it one notch.  The truck started a deep humming almost  grinding as the turbines wound up to full speed.  Dan then tuned it to the next notch sending  the air fuel mix into the ignition chamber.   The engine then burst into a full roar, and the vibrations  lessened.  Dan then eased up on the gas  letting the engine idle. Dan jumped out of his seat.</p><p>"So  what do you think?" Dan asked.  "I  believe I solved the exhaust problem.   The system is holding up.  Notice  how at the running RPM the stabilizers worked fine, but during start up or shut  down they don't hold it all. Still haven't got it but" Dan then continued to  ramble about the engine.</p><p>"How  did you fit this thing in the engine compartment?" Sarah interrupted.</p><p>"I  extended the front a foot." Dan said shutting down the beast.</p><p>Sarah  examined the truck.  Come to think of  it.  The beast was longer.  "And you just finished now?"</p><p>"I  finished the engine itself a week ago.   The exhaust system itself took until about an hour ago," Dan said.  "I was just getting some coffee and a bite."</p><p>"Come  on bro." Sarah said, "We can have breakfast while Dan over here cleans up."</p><p>In the  kitchen Ranma ate his cereal in silence.   "I can't believe it," Sarah said. "He did it.  Dan did it. He put a fucking turbo prop  turbine in a truck.  What the hell is he  going to fuel it with, diesel I guess."   Ranma was surprised, but ever since Nerima he had been slightly deadened  to weirdness. Well not since the arrival, but since Genma's death.</p><p>They  finished the food and walked over to the living room.  Sarah got her pack.  "We can stop off and get you a one after  school.  Then, we can stop at the place  where Mom met Dad."</p><p>Ranma  followed Sarah back to the garage.  Dan  had cleaned up all the hoses and put away most of his tools.  He had the truck started, and Ranma could  fell the vibrations from inside the den.   Dan was in the driver's seat and had the window down. "Come on in the  back," he said.</p><p>The  truck was a four door, so Ranma went around to the passenger side to get  in.  the interior was plain but  comfortable Once inside, Sarah clipped on her seatbelt.  "Better do yours too," she said to  Ranma.  Ranma complied afraid for what  Dan was about to do.</p><p>With a  mad grin Dan shifted into drive.  The  truck slowly rolled out of the bay.   Ranma relaxed. Dan then used garage remote to close the door, then he  hit it.</p><p>The  beasts shot down the driveway.  Diving  down a dirt road at over fifty, the truck hit every pothole and rock.  Dan's suspension held true as the truck  seemed to glide over the obstructions, then again the vibration of the engine  could be masking the road condition.</p><p>Dan  came to the end of the driveway and onto paved road.  "Oh yeah. Four wheel drive.  It's the only way to fly."</p><p>Once on  asphalt Dan opened it up.   Driving with  disturbing skill and control, Dan wrenched the truck around curves and floored  it trough to straight-aways.  Ranma swore  that when the beast crested a hill it would go airborne.</p><p>The  truck slammed to ground, slowed.  Then  Dan swerved it into a spin and when it had twisted 90 degrees Dan floored it  again, to get through the intersection</p><p>Ranma  had restored to closing his eyes, but that just made it worse. Now it felt like  they were doing barrel rolls.  Thankful  for the seatbelt, Ranma was felt like he was being pulled apart.  Then it stopped.  The only sound was the rumbling of the  turbine.</p><p>"First  time in a car?" Sarah said grinning.</p><p>"This  is not a car," Ranma replied, felling sick.</p><p>"Got  that right," Dan said. "Hear that baby purr."</p><p>Ranma  looked out the window or tried to. They were heavily tinted.  The truck had stopped in front of a large  house.  Dan revved the engine, sounding  very much like a lifting chopper. A big chopper.  Ranma thought he saw motion in the yard but  it was hard to tell.  Then the front  passenger door opened.  A tall blonde  entered the truck.  Her hair was pulled  to the back of her head with a large hair clip.   She was wearing a tight blouse and   skirt that nicely showed off her body.</p><p>"You  could use you horn like a normal person," she said, putter her pack on the floor  between her legs.</p><p>"Would  a normal person put a helicopter engine in his truck. Oh and, you were right  the problem with the exhaust was in volume not temperature," Dan said.</p><p>"Told  yah. You must be Ranma, Sarah's long lost brother" she said turning back.</p><p>"And  you are?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Allison  Terson, Dan's girlfriend," the blonde said with her arm outstretched.</p><p>Ranma  shook the given hand.</p><p>"Allison  may be a bit mad but otherwise she's family," Sarah said.</p><p>"Oh,  I'm the crazy one, not the gun nut, or helicopter boy," Allison stated.</p><p>"Hey!"  Dan and Sarah said simultaneously.</p><p>"Kidding.   Open this bad boy up," Allison said  enthusiastically.</p><p>Dan  dropped it into drive and was off.  This  time Ranma kept his eyes open.  Trees  streaked past with such velocity that Ranma was unable to identify them.  At least when they reached Lock Ridge proper  Dan cut back driving somewhat sanely.</p><p>He  pulled into the parking lot to a smallish high school.  The building itself looked rather new and  well maintained. Dan put the truck in park, and turned off the ignition.  The turbine slowed and stopped.  Everyone opened their door when  Ranma cried out "Damn it."</p><p>Ranma  was now in her female form, soaking wet.</p><p>"You  weren't lying were you," Allison said to Dan.</p><p>"Hey  why'd you have to tell," Ranma said.</p><p>"She  would have found out sooner or later," Dan said.</p><p>"What  happened?" Sarah asked getting her pack.</p><p>"Car  drove past and hit a puddle," Ranma said.</p><p>"Weird,"  Allison said.</p><p>Ranma  perked up at this.  Was someone finally  going to be shocked or freaked out by this curse.</p><p>"You're  twins," Allison said pointing at both Ranma and Sarah.</p><p>Dan  walked up, wearing a large black trench coat, over the jeans, shirt, and boots  he had on yesterday. "Well they are sisters. Allison want to help me check to  see if the drive damage anything?"</p><p>"Sure  we've got some time before class," Allison said following Dan to the back gate  of the beast.  Where he got out a  flashlight and a multi-meter.</p><p>"Come  on Ranma they should have water in the bathroom," Sarah said.</p><p>Ranma  followed her up the steps of the school. "Wait what about that mind thing you  told me about?"</p><p>"Too  draining."</p><p>"But  what if someone sees us?"</p><p>"We're  a half an hour early hardly anyone's here, and the bathroom is just on the  other side of the  entrance."</p><p>"Fine,"  Ranma said and entered the school.</p><p>The  main entrance to the school was a large two story foyer, with three hallways  branching out of it and two sets of stairs going to the second floor.  The second floor had region that ran around  the foyer a floor bellow. This was the student lounge and the entrance was  visible from it.  Even if either Ranma or  Sarah had looked up they would not have seen a girl with short black hair  sitting in a chair near the guardrail and using a laptop.  The lights were off in the lounge and she sat  in shadows.</p><p>The  girl, however, was looking down.  "What  the?" she thought, "Sarah O'Neill has a twin sister?" It was hard to tell at  this angle.  So she took out her camera.  It had a zoom lens. "Yes they're almost  identical," she thought to herself.  She  then hooked up her I/O sphere to the laptop and did a scan.   "Interesting, Sarah had a filled template,  no surprise there, but this other one had the potential and something  else.  Code that the interpreter won't  recognize.  Oh well, I wanted to try out  the effective range of this thing," she thought.</p><p>The  girl loaded a template.  She found it  while hacking an old classmates computer.   A bit sloppily done, but the creator had never intended to use it.  Sarah had been working on her template for  years and the writer of this one had to have known it.  So the template in question was only an idle  fantasy.  Nevertheless when the girl  found it she made a copy.  She made her  own modifications, but never intend to be able to use it</p><p>The  template was designed for Sarah's body alone and she already had a  template,  but now this other girl. .  .  She was close enough to Sarah for the  template to work.  The girl transferred  the template to the I/O sphere and locked onto Sarah's twin.  The girl waited for Ranma to go into the  bathroom, ("Odd why'd she go in the men's room.   Oh well") then told the sphere to imprint the template.</p><p>Ranma  was in the bathroom about to turn the faucet on when her body was engulfed in a  pink light.  Ranma started to lift off  the ground, the light getting brighter, blinding her.  A tingling started on her skin, then grew  deeper seeming to go through her.</p><p>Then it  was done.  Ranma was standing again. She  looked at her reflection in mute horror.   Her hair was had become unbound,   then styled into a feathered wavy body with pink, glittery  highlights.  Part was pulled back with a  pink bow in a loose, high pony tail while the rest flowed freely.  A golden tiara set with pink gems rested on  the crown of her head.</p><p>Ranma  trembled then looked further down.  Her  face was extensively made up. It worked to maximize her femininity, but what  really unsettled her was the eye shadow and lipstick.  The eye shadow was a very faded very glittery  pink, and the lipstick was a nauseating coral pink.</p><p>Her  ears had been pierced and long sparkling earrings dangled from the lobes.  Her neck was surrounded by a white  choker.  Ranma froze when she saw shat  she was wearing.  It was a fuku.  Not the normal school type, but the magic  girl type.  A tiny skirt and a  tight, body hugging leotard, with pink bows  and  ribbons that kept her decent while  still giving plenty of cleavage.  It was  white with pink trim and also sparkly.   She shuddered again when she realized that she was wearing panties,  undoubtedly pink.</p><p>She  looked down to see long shapely smooth legs.   Running from pink high heeled boots to the ridiculously short  skirt.  She had seen her body in  feminine, sexy outfits before, but nothing like this.  She pulled her hand to her face to see if  this was real, when she noticed her arm.   It had a slender feminine metal bracer on it engraved in fine pink  lines.  Her fingernails were long,  shaped, and covered in sparkly pink polish.</p><p>She  then looked behind to see  two small  angel wings sprouting form her back.  The  fuku was low backed as not to interfere with the wings. They twitched when she  touched them.  She could feel from them.  They moved slightly. The wings were a part of her body.</p><p>Ranma  did what anyone else would do in a situation similar to this: she fainted.</p><p>Sarah  waited next to the door for a minute and when Ranma failed to exit went in.  "Damn," Sarah said when she found Ranma passed out on the floor dressed like  some cosplay reject</p><p>"Wake  up," Sarah said to the pseudo magic girl.</p><p>Ranma  opened her eyes looked at her state of dress and promptly fainted again.</p><p>"Fine  be that way," Sarah said as she left the room.</p><p>Dan was  laying under the beast checking the exhaust system when Allison kicked him  lightly. "What?" Dan asked sliding out from beneath the undercarriage.</p><p>Allison  pointed to Sarah who said, "Dan we have a problem."</p><p>Dan and  Alison went inside the school behind Sarah.   Arriving inside the bathroom Dan halted at what he saw.  Allison stood next to him silent. He turned  to his cousin, "Please don't tell me that Ranma was just imprinted."</p><p>"I  haven't done a scan, but it appears that way."</p><p>"Just  great," Dan muttered. "Suggestions?"</p><p>"The  standing circle," Sarah said, looking ad her near twin.</p><p>Allison  nodded.</p><p>"Okay lets  get him to the beast."</p><p>"Her,"  Allison corrected.</p><p>"Whatever,"  Sarah said.</p><p>The  lady in shadows watched as her new toy was carried out of the bathroom and out  the building.  She had an inkling as to  where they would take their charge.  She  would watch the circle and wait.</p><p>Ranma  opened her eyes, then looked at herself.   She was wearing her customary Chinese style clothes and she wasn't  felling any wings or other weird stuff. Her ears didn't have earnings nor were  pierced. "It was only a dream," she said.</p><p>"Not  quite," Dan said.  He was sitting on the  ground a few feet away working at a laptop.   The computer was connected to a small metal sphere.</p><p>Ranma  stood up.  They were all in a small  clearing.  Tall trees arched overhead,  closing in on the sky giving the effect of a cathedral or shrine.  Ranma then noticed the stones.  Running the circumference of the  clearing where thirteen large boulders.  Looking like natural formations at first  glance, the stones changed to seeming artificial and placed.  "What is this place?" Ranma asked. "What  happened to me."</p><p>"This a  nexus, a well, a stream, and a forge," Dan said typing.</p><p>"But  what happened."</p><p>"What  of magic do you see?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"  'Magic' is what we do not understand.  It  is a matter of perspective," Dan said, still typing.</p><p>"This  valley has always attracted those of potential," Sarah said. "Saints, madmen  seers, sorcerers, the unique, the great, and the small.  People like our mother."</p><p>"Is  this place what brought mom here?"</p><p>"Yes,"  Sarah said, then continued. "One person who came here was a sorcerer fed up  with the old ways.  The magic he studied  required the precise recitation of thousands of lines of script.  It was time consuming and difficult to write  new spells and edit old ones, then came computers.   He embraced the emerging technology.  Here was a device capable of storing mass  quantities of information, and executing directions with a precision and speed  unheard of."</p><p>Ranma  blinked.  Where was she going with this.</p><p>"But he  still had to recite  his spells, and type  in his observations.  So he created  this," Sarah said pointing to the sphere.</p><p>"What  is it?"</p><p>"An I/O  sphere. It can scan ambient surroundings, and execute spells."</p><p>Slight  comprehension dawned on Ranma, "So what happened to me was. . ."</p><p>"A  program being imprinted onto your body."</p><p>"Is it  another curse?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"See  for yourself," Dan said turning the computer around.</p><p>Ranma  looked at the screen.  Strange code  scrolled along one side of the screen.   It was similar to the code Sarah was using when she worked on the  computers yesterday, but something about it was different. The other side had  assorted images.  An earring, a bracer, a  heeled boot,  a tiara, and a few other  items, but the largest image held them all.   It was a rendering of herself or Sarah, at this resolution it was  impossible to tell.  The image was  wearing the exact outfit Ranma had changed into in the bathroom.  "What the?" Ranma said. "Is this the program  that wizard made?"</p><p>"Sort  of," Sarah said.  "This is a more visual  version of the program but it still has the same core as the original."</p><p>"So  what happened to me?"</p><p>"That's  what we're trying to find out. Some went through a lot of trouble writing  this.  Did you see anyone in the bathroom  or an I/O sphere?"</p><p>"No. Why?"</p><p>"This  is bad," Dan said. "You see an I/O sphere has a limited range, like a few  feet.  But what you're saying indicates a  long range sphere."</p><p>"A  sphere could have been hidden in the room," Allison suggested.</p><p>"But  why there? There aren't too many spheres rolling around, and that still doesn't  explain why someone made a Sarah based template, that would never have been  imprinted if Ranma had never shown up."</p><p>"Imprint  what are you talking about?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Sarah  inhaled then began to speak, "Magic has three parts:  a base energy required to power operations, a  set of rules or procedures to organize and direct the base energy, and a vessel  to facilitate the changes. With Calash only certain people have the potential  to be a vessel.   Take your Jusenkyou  curse.  The spring is the power.  The curse itself is the code.  You are the vessel.  The result is a curse that can change you  sex.  Now with me the circle is the  power.  My template is the code.  And I'm the vessel."  Sarah closed her eyes, and a orange light  enveloped her.</p><p>When it  dimmed, Sarah was wearing a tight fitting suit of power armor.  Her hair was pulled back and had orange  highlights.  She also held a huge  futuristic riffle.</p><p>Dan  stood up, his coat trailing behind him and with a fluid motion produced an Uzi  in each hand.  He was also wearing  several bandoleers filled with clips of ammo and had about a dozen guns in  various holsters.  His eyes were glowing  red.</p><p>Ranma  twitched, then felt a tingling. "Not again." Ranma though before the pink light  engulfed her. "Damn, damn, damn.  Fuck," The now fuku clad girl chanted.</p><p>"So you  know how to swear in English," Sarah commented using her gun's strap to rest it  on her back.</p><p>Dan  started sniggering.</p><p>"What  are you laughing at?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Sorry.  You don't see a cast member of Sailor Moon spewing a stream of expletives all  that often." Dan said, holstering the two guns he held.</p><p>"You  see Ranma, a template is a particularly large bit of code that can augment a  person's form extensively, giving them powers and abilities.  Because of their size and complexity, a  template takes months of solid coding and has to be specially made for its  user," Sarah said.</p><p>"But  wait couldn't this have been designed for you, after all we're nearly  identical," Ranma said.</p><p>"No I  already have a template."</p><p>Ranma  had a bad felling as to where this was going.</p><p>"You  see technically a template can't be deleted,   although once installed it can be edited almost in its entirety."</p><p>"So you  could just cut it out. overwrite the existing program," Ranma stated.</p><p>"It's  not that simple," Dan said looking at the laptop. "There are some variables  that can be edited right off the bat, but the rest of the code needs a  decryption key to be changed.  As it is  now your template is essentially read-only.</p><p>"That's  why this couldn't have been meant for Sarah.   Her template is locked too, but she has the key."</p><p>"Could  you hack into it and find my key?"</p><p>"None  of us could.  Perhaps someone <i>really</i> good might get in.  But if we could get the edit code to your  template, then we could strip it down to the base and rewrite the entire  thing."</p><p>"Wait,  what about you and Allison, do you two have templates?"</p><p>Dan  pointed to the guns.</p><p>"So, I  knew a guy that could do stuff like that."</p><p>Dan  took out a knife, pulled up his left   sleeve, and jabbed the point in.   He then drew it forward until it reached his wrist.  Only a small amount of blood oozed out of the  huge gash.  "Get closer I'm only going to  show this once."  Ranma complied, walking  in to get a better view of the self mutilation.   Dan then spread out the skin on either side of the cut, revealing metal  strands intermixed with muscles.</p><p>"You're  a. . ." Ranma tried to say, but didn't know the English translation.</p><p>"Cyborg," Dan offered.</p><p>"Yes, a  only real gear head would tweak his own body," Allison said.</p><p>Dan  grinned and pulled the wound closed, where it promptly began to heal.</p><p>"And  you turn into?" Ranma inquired.</p><p>A  sliver fluid seemed to pour out of Allison's skin. It covered her skin and  clothing, then lost definition and turned transparent, clear.  She had turned invisible. "Quicksilver,"  Allison's   disembodied voice said.  "A synthetic compound that can bend  light.  I have a gland produces this  chemical."  The space next to Dan  distorted forming a vaguely human semi-sliver shape.  The quicksilver then flaked off and fell to  the ground. Leaving Allison  visible  again.</p><p>"Okay,"  Ranma said. At least this explained why they weren't surprised by the  curse.  "So I can't  change the template without that code."</p><p>Sarah  switched back to her default form, looked at the screen, "Not entirely.  Dan said you could change minimal things like  colors and other simple modifications."</p><p>Ranma  looked down, "So, I'm stuck with this unless we get the key."</p><p>"Yes  but, unlike your curse, the user has   near total activation control of   a template."</p><p>"So I'm  stuck with this damn thing, but I don't need to use it."</p><p>"True,"  Dan said tentatively, while reverting.</p><p>"Why  does this crap happen to me?" groaned Ranma.</p><p>"Most  can be attributed to you father," Sarah said. "He was the one who got you  cursed, and it was his death that made it unstable.  All making you shine like a beacon to anyone  with a sphere. Your template does have advantages. You're faster, stronger,  have sharper senses, quicker healing rates, and other advancements."</p><p>"All of  which I already have," Ranma said.</p><p>"Yes,  yes you're the world's greatest martial artist, but this essentially triples  your abilities," Dan said, looking over Sarah's shoulder and watching the code.</p><p>"And  those are functional," Sarah said point to Ranma's wings.</p><p>Ranma  looked at the small wings skeptically.</p><p>Sarah  read some of the code, "They expand in size when in use."</p><p>Ranma  looked at her sister questionably, "Oh well might as well try it." She  thought  Ranma leapt up into the  air.  She planned on only going up about  ten feet, but was surprised when she shoot up nearly the full height of the  trees in the clearing.  Ranma found  herself 60 feet up, then she started to fall.</p><p>The  wings reacted.  The grew out until they  were six feet form wing tip to wing tip.   They spread out and supported her body.   Going on instincts provided by the template Ranma managed to get a  controlled flight.</p><p>The  three Americans watched the girl glide around. "She learns fast," Allison said  as Ranma pulled her wings back and  went  into a steep dive then spread them out to go back up.</p><p>"Apparently  rapid adaptation is the centerpiece to Ranma's training." Sarah said while  Ranma did a barrel roll.</p><p>"Who  ever designed this didn't think it through." Dan said when Ranma's skirt  flipped up during a maneuver.</p><p>"Very  true," Allison said.</p><p>They  continued to watched the pink girl glide around, for a couple more minutes.  "You know we do have school," Sarah said.</p><p>"Do you  really want to go," Dan asked.</p><p>"Nah."</p><p>Finally  Ranma descended to the ground.  Her feet  touched the grass, and slipped.  She then  toppled falling flat on her face. No longer needed, her wings shrank back to  their original size.</p><p>"You're  right," Sarah told Dan, "I mean high heels.   This was obviously never designed to be used."</p><p>"What?"  Ranma asked, getting black up.</p><p>"Look,  not a hair out of place," Allison said.</p><p>"Yeah  this template has a consistency function.   It can't be removed, damaged, or stained.  Within reason"</p><p>"If  this thing was never intended to be used, then why did I get hit by it," Ranma  asked.</p><p>"Think  about this, you spend over a year making this program that's never going to be  used, and then you see this girl that fits the template exactly.  A girl that has the potential, and has yet to  be imprinted," Dan proposed.</p><p>"But  why did they even make it in the first place," Sarah asked.</p><p>"Someone  might have a crush on you." Allison said.</p><p>"Right  so he spends a few months writing a program," Sarah said. "Wait, Ranma how long  have you been cursed?"</p><p>"About  a year and a half," Ranma said.</p><p>"That's  enough time," Dan stated.</p><p>"But  who here knew about Ranma and the curse that long ago," Alison asked.</p><p>Sarah  shrugged.</p><p>"What's  going on?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"We  don't know," Dan said.</p><p>"You  were saying that you could do some minor modifications without a key," Ranma  said grabbing the part of the fuku.</p><p>"To a  limited extend," Sarah said. "Just colors and such."</p><p>"Can  you fix it so-"</p><p>"It's  not as garishly pink or girly," Sarah completed. "I'll try, but remember this  is a magic girl template."  Sarah then  typed a few things in and sent a command to the sphere.  Pink light once again engulfed Ranma but it  then shifted to red. It died down and Ranma found herself still dressed, but  there were a few changes.  The fuku's  trim, the boots, the bows, the ribbons, and her nails were now all a deep red.</p><p>"I  essentially changed everything that was pink to red.  Except you hair.  The highlights are part of the restricted  code.  Sorry," Sarah pulled out a hand  mirror and gave it to Ranma.  "I managed  to cut the makeup down, but I couldn't get rid of it all. As for all the  glitter and crap, I got it out of your nails, off your face, removed from your  clothes, and most of what was in your hair.   There was nothing I could to about the jewelry though.  It's restricted too."</p><p>Ranma  looked at her face.  It was better, but  she still had traces of makeup on still had the earrings and that damned tiara  now had red jewels instead of pink.  Her  hair looked essentially the same but with a red bow holding back the partial  pony tail and it was only a little bit sparkly.</p><p>"How is  it?  I think I can get rid of the wings  too," Sarah suggested.</p><p>"No  those are the only upside to this mess, and thanks this is better at least,"  Ranma said handing back the mirror. "Now how do I change back?"</p><p>"Just  concentrated on it a little bit," Dan said looking around.  He then made a slight hand motion and Allison  disappeared.</p><p>Ranma  tried to concentrate when the air was punctuated by an explosion.  "Heads up," Sarah yelled already in her  template.  Dan, also shifted, had moved  in to catch the now visible Allison who had been thrown into the air by something.  Ranma leapt up, twisted in midair, and came  down behind Sarah, who had shouldered her gun and started firing into the  woods.</p><p>"I'll  take Allison and the equipment back to the truck while you two get that  bastard," Dan shouted over the fire.</p><p>"What  just happened?" Ranma asked her wings still at full size from the jump.</p><p>"Dan  thought we were being watched, so he sent Allison out to investigate, and that  happened," Sarah said pointing to Allison's semi-conscious  state. "So we're going in."</p><p>Sarah  went over to the nearest stone and crouched behind it, "I think those bracers are  amps."</p><p>"What?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Amplifiers,  they take residual energy and step up the power.  So you can do chi blasts and other fun  stuff."</p><p>Ranma  let it pass that she already had that ability. "But what about-"</p><p>Sarah  cut him off, "Dan and Allison will be fine. Lets go in."  Sarah then moved to behind a tree.</p><p>Ranma  followed her and crouched in the next tree over. "What're we dealing with?"</p><p>"Most  likely the same person that imprinted you."</p><p>The  forest had gone silent.  Sarah held her  gun ready.  Ranma knew the procedure for  forest pursuit.  They both watched, then  Ranma saw something.  It was  slight movement about a thousand feet  away.   Ranma pointed it out.</p><p>Sarah  motioned, forward and then did a countdown. When only her pointer finger was  left they rushed forward, keeping low.</p><p>Ranma  felt something coming; it was fast and dangerous.  She jumped of   to the left, Sarah to the right, just before a large ball of energy  impacted.</p><p>Ranma  then used her wings to glide back to the right.   She looked over to see Sarah executing a similar maneuver, with her  armor's jumpjets.  Sarah was firing at  the source of the blast.  Ranma  concentrated and tried out the amps.  The  etchings on the bracers began to glow red, followed by a thick red beam pouring  out of each fist.</p><p>The  beams hit the hillock cutting through trees, rocks and blasting into the  ground.  They caused massive destruction,  obliterating whatever they touched.   Sarah pulled back and landed.  She  had her riffle down and was waving Ranma off. She flew over to her sister and  landed, this time not falling down.</p><p>"What?  Why aren't we going in?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Because,  whoever attacked us is gone," Sarah said, walking to the blast crater.</p><p>Ranma  looked down at the bracers.</p><p>"Come  over here," Sarah told Ranma.</p><p>Ranma  looked into the hole, and saw only charred rock, and bits of metal</p><p>"See.  We were chasing a decoy."</p><p>"Some  decoy," Ranma said looking around the forest.</p><p>"Some  blast," Sarah said. "I mean this thing's five feet deep."</p><p>"Aren't  you worried about them coming at us now?"</p><p>"Not  really.  If someone else was here they'd  have attacked by now."</p><p>"Oh, So  what exactly was that decoy."</p><p>"A  remote operated observer armed with a particle cannon.  Quite a feat, only a handful of people in  town know how to make one." Sarah changed the subject, "So if you have that  kind of power with an amp you must have ungodly skill."</p><p>"That's  what I was trying to say, I'm the world's-." Ranma's speech was cut by Sarah's  laughing.  "What?"</p><p>"Oh  nothing it's just the image of you swooping in, to defend love and justice."</p><p>Ranma  glared at her.</p><p>"You  really need to lighten up sis," Sarah said. She then activated her jumpjets and  flew back to the standing ring.</p><p>"Hey,"  Ranma shouted, using her wings to fly after Sarah.</p><p>Back in  the ring.  Dan was standing guard.  Allison was in the beast resting and checking  up on some code, luckily she was only grazed.   Dan saw the twins fly back in. Sarah landed heavily on her boots when  the jets cut, while Ranma's landing was more delicate, so as not to fall down  on those damned heels.</p><p>"What  was it?" Dan asked tracking the edge of the circle.</p><p>"Watcher,  decoy drone," Sarah replied.</p><p>"Okay  back in the truck." Dan said.</p><p>Once  everyone was inside the tuck. Dan reverted back to normal form and initiated  pre-start.  After the turbine acquired  full velocity Dan pulled away from the circle.   He looked in the review mirror and saw   the twins. "Um can you change back.   Seeing you two next to each other is kinda unsettling."</p><p>Allison  turned and looked back, "It's like seeing opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p>Ranma  uncomfortable sitting with those wings, even retracted, was happy to  comply.  She concentrated, the red light  came, and was back to normal.  She turned  to see Sarah back in her green dress and vest.   "Wait," Ranma thought. "Did I just call my girl form normal."  Aloud she asked, "How will the curse interact  with my template or whatever you called that thing."</p><p>Allison  spoke up, "While I was waiting, I found this strange bit of code.  It's magical in nature, but our compiler  can't recognize it.  I fairly sure it's  your curse, but it's partially corrupted.   I think I found the activation trigger.   It's the worst off, and I can't fix it."</p><p>"Why?"  Ranma asked, as usual more bad news.</p><p>"Each  style of magic is a completely different language.  I only know Calash, the one supported by the  I/O sphere."</p><p>"Can it  be removed?"</p><p>"Yes  but, your template needs a female body to work. So technically you're now a  girl that has a curse that turns you into a guy."</p><p>"What!"  Ranma said, definitely bad news.</p><p>"You  can still go back and forth, I think.   It's just that if the curse were removed you be a stuck as girl. You're  female body is now your default form.   Don't worry I made a copy of the curse as it is now so if it ever degrades  beyond functionally. I can just load the old one in as an update."</p><p>"Um,  where are we going?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"The  cemetery," Dan said, while driving at his normal speed, which was going as fast  as skill and mechanics could allow, and considering the beast had a refurbished  helicopter engine and Dan was one of   best drivers in the time zone fast was an amazingly inadequate  descriptor.</p><p>"Wait  my curse was spring of drowned girl.  If  I really turned into a girl, it wouldn't work." Ranma said morbidly.</p><p>"Not  really, the curse itself is just a switching mechanism.  It has to do both, go from guy to girl, and  from girl to guy.  The only thing gender  specific is the installation.  That's why  only a guy could get your curse," Allison explained.</p><p>"Does  Jack know about templates?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh he  knows everything." Sarah said.  "After  all he grew up here."</p><p>"But  wasn't that before computers,"</p><p>"Yeah  he was here during the founding of Calash, but remember the circle had been  here since the beginning. So this place has always been weird."</p><p>"So the  local law just ignores all this stuff."</p><p>"Law  enforcement exits solely to keep the peace.   If  the wrong people on the  outside knew about this place then it'll turn into a media circus.  So unless someone really screws up Jack and  his deputies won't intervene," Dan said.</p><p>"But  he's so busy," Ranma said.</p><p>"Keeping  the outsiders in the dark, presenting a semi-normal facade."</p><p>"But he  let me come here."</p><p>"Well  you are from Nerima," Sarah said.</p><p>"True,"  Ranma said.</p><p>"We're  here," Dan said turning off the engine.</p><p>"Won't  the two programs interact badly," Sarah asked getting out of the truck.</p><p>"No,  the template takes precedence," Allison said, also out of the beast. "The curse  is disabled when the template is in use."</p><p>"What if  Ranma's in guy form and shifts to template?" Dan asked smoothing his coat,  after exiting the truck.</p><p>That  created a rather disturbing mental image for Ranma.</p><p>"Well,  the template is design to work with Ranma's girl body and that body alone, so  the curse would have to activate first for the template to work," Allison said.</p><p>Dan  and Allison then walked off.  Leaving Ranma alone with Sarah. "Where're  they going?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"The  graves of his parents," Sarah said.</p><p>Ranma  looked back to see Dan standing in front of two stones, his coat billowing  behind him in the light wind. His eyes were covered with dark sunglasses.  He and Allison had their arms wrapped around  each other's waists. Ranma turned to see Sarah standing in front of another  stone.  Ranma walked up to her.  He knew what the inscription would say:  Nodoka O'Neill.</p><p>"Sorry  'bout this," Sarah said.</p><p>"What?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"I mean  all this.  Your dad, our mom, your curse,  the template, having you stuck out in the middle of nowhere."</p><p>"None  of it's your fault."</p><p>"No, I  guess not, but look at all the crap that happened to you and you haven't even  been here a full day yet."</p><p>"It's  nowhere near as bad as the first day in Nerima. I didn't get any fiancées this  time."</p><p>"Was it  really that bad over there?"</p><p>"Ever  hear the phrase 'Alone in a crowd.' "</p><p>Sarah  nodded.</p><p>"That's  what it was like everyone wanted to kill me, marry me, or use and exploit  me.  I was just a trophy to them.  It was  day after day of the same. . ."</p><p>Sarah  maintained silence as Ranma spoke.</p><p>". . .  but the worst part was that I egged it on. I wanted the attention. It feed my  overblown ego.  I was a loud jerk. It  took the death of my father to see this.   Granted he was a complete bastard, but still someone had to die."</p><p>Sarah  turned to see Allison and Dan walking back to the truck. "Come on," she said to  Ranma.</p><p>"Now  where are we going," Sarah asked.</p><p>"To get  who did this to Ranma," Dan said driving around blind curve at 70.</p><p>"Didn't  you say the template was locked in?" Ranma asked, with feint hope.</p><p>"Yes,  but we can still get the key code, and then we could change it to something  less-"</p><p>"Girly,"  Sarah completed.</p><p>"Disturbing,"  Allison offered.</p><p>Ranma  found that appealing that if he could get full access to the template all that  magic girl crap could be edited out. "Any suspects?" she inquired.</p><p>"Remember  how I said this place attracts people with potential," Sarah said.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"If  this place attracts new people then how can it stay a small town?"</p><p>Ranma  shrugged.</p><p>"Lock  Ridge has a rather low birth rate, about 1.2 children per family, but the  influx of new people keeps the population essentially stable. Think about it,  Dan's and only child, Allison too, and Dad had only one sister."</p><p>"How  does this help us find out who did this?"</p><p>"I was  getting to that.  The point is that  nearly everyone in Lock Ridge has some magical abilities.  I don't mean the actual writing of the code,  anyone can do that, but those that have the potential to be a vessel, people  that can actually execute spells.  But  fewer people have the skill to write templates, and even fewer can make remote  observers and other golem based entities." Sarah turned to Allison, "Find any  signatures in the template?"</p><p>"I  think so does anyone know the handle 'germ_forge'?" Allison asked</p><p>"I  do.  Sean Reno used it a while back," Dan  said.</p><p>"That  would do it," Sarah confirmed. "Sean's got the skills."</p><p>Dan  nodded and changed course driving back to town.   "Okay, Sean graduated last year. He works for an engineering firm two towns  over.  He still lives in town.  So here's the plan we go to his  apartment.  Wait for him to come back  then-"  Dan's directions were cut when a  red Honda drove past him going the other way.   "Or we could just ram his car off the road," Dan said while flipping the  beast around in a quick snap.</p><p>"New  plan: everyone switch.  Sarah you EPS the  car, Allison you disable him, and Ranma provide cover." Dan said accelerating  after the Honda.</p><p>The red  car, seeing what was chasing it, speed up trying to get away.</p><p>"Take  him out now, I don't want to risk him changing," Dan ordered.</p><p>Sarah  shifted lowered and her window.  Aiming  her all purpose gun from the future at the car, she fired.  The electron pulse saturation hit the car,  temporarily disabling its electronics. Unable to fire its sparkplugs, the small  car rolled to a stop.</p><p>"Hurry  before it wears off," Dan said hitting the brakes</p><p>Ranma,  about to jump out of the truck, heard Sarah shout, "What the hell are you  doing?  Shift. If this goes hot you'll  need every little bit." Ranma complied, changing forms and gliding low towards  the car.</p><p>"What  the hell?" Sean said, looking in the rearview mirror. First that thing starts  tailgating him, then an extra from Mech. Warrior kills his car, and  then some type of angel or something flies  out looking pissed enough to kill.  Sean  opened his door and steeped out, unfortunately he failed to notice the front  passenger door to the beast open and close.</p><p>Sean  fell over twitching, after being hit with a taser to the back. Allison then appeared  in a shower of quicksilver behind him.</p><p>"Good  work," Dan said, walking to the body, already in his own template.</p><p>Sean's  brain dragged its way back to conciseness. "That's the last time I mix tequila  and vodka," he said opening his eyes.    He was met with two angry redheads staring him down. The one in the  power armor had her gun pointed at his neck, while the angel girl had a glowing  fist over his head. Sean rolled his head back, smacking the pavement. "Damn it,  that hurt."</p><p>He  looked beyond the twin girls to see a someone who had probably seen The Matrix  one too many times, standing next to a normal looking blonde.</p><p>"I  suggest you don't move, shift, or do anything else." Dan said.</p><p>"Um  what's going on?" Sean said still thinking he had a bad hangover.</p><p>"Recognize  this," Dan said, pointing to Ranma.</p><p>Sean  looked at the girl, his head clearing up. "Um she's in a template."</p><p>"That  you imprinted on her this morning.  We  want the edit password." Sarah said, still pointing the weapon at him.</p><p>"Um, no  I didn't, and I don't have that."</p><p>"Then  where were you?" Dan inquired, skeptically.</p><p>"At  work, I was driving home. You can call my boss."</p><p>"No  need," Dan said pondering. "But you never answered, have you seen this  template?"</p><p>"No  man.  Why?"</p><p>The  blonde spoke up, "Why then was you sig. in the template Germ_forge?"</p><p>"Um was  the sig. Germ_forge.34h9."</p><p>"No it  was h12."</p><p>Still  laying on the ground Sean said, "I get it.   You see the h12 files weren't mine I just had them archived on my system  for a friend,"</p><p>"Who?"  Dan asked.</p><p>"Spore."</p><p>"What?"  Ranma said.</p><p>"No.  You see Spore was his handle.  I never knew his real name."</p><p>"Then  who imprinted?" Dan asked.</p><p>"Either  Spore or the hacker."</p><p>"Hacker?"</p><p>"Yeah,  a few months ago someone got into my system, the bitch was good. She got all of  my H archives."</p><p>"How do  you know it was a girl?" Dan inquired.</p><p>"I have  my ways," Sean said.</p><p>"Let  him go," Allison said.</p><p>"What?"  Ranma said.</p><p>"He's  telling the truth"</p><p>"So  he's just a courier," Dan pondered. "Yup, let him go."</p><p>Sarah backed  off.  Ranma tried to but wobbled and  almost fell.  Damn heels.  Sean got up, and dusted himself off.</p><p>"Could  you give us all the info you've got on that hacker and Spore?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"Okay,  I'll just get it from my laptop," Sean said before realization kicked in. "Crap  my files!" Sean said running to his laptop.   He took the computer out of the case and turned it on, or attempted to  do so.  Sarah's EPS blast had thoroughly  scrambled the hard drives, at least is wasn't an EMP that would have done permanent  damage to all the electronics in a half mile radius.  Sean was slightly depressed, "Oh well at  least all my critical stuff it at home. Can I e-mail those files to you?"</p><p>"Wait,"  Ranma said. "You don't mind that we ran car off the road, shocked you, and  interrogated you at gunpoint, but your really bummed that your computer's  broken."</p><p>"Point  being?" Sean said putting his computer back in its case.  "Can I go now?"</p><p>"Sure  why not," Allison said.</p><p>Sean  got into his car, and turned the ignition. Sarah walked away. "Um you're sure  the car will still work right?" Dan asked. "I mean it fired his computer, you  told me EPS had no side effects.  You  said it would only effect a small area and just temporarily disable."</p><p>Sarah  looked into the distance.</p><p>"Please  respond,"  Dan stated.</p><p>The  sound of a Honda turning over and driving away, was followed by Sarah's  response, "Yeah pretty sure."</p><p>Dan put  his hand on his forehead and groaned.</p><p>"Wait  I'm the one in a skirt but you're the one stressed out," Ranma said.</p><p>"It's  just that we're back at square one," Dan said reverting back to normal. "We  don't know who did this to you or why, and we still don't have a key."</p><p>Ranma  realizing that the operation was over, reverted as well.  Sarah also back in her normal form walked up  to her, "Why'd you fly during the intercept," she asked.</p><p>"Those  dammed heels don't allow for any speed," Ranma said walking to the truck.</p><p>"I  think that's their point," Sarah said going back to the truck.</p><p>Dan got  in the truck and started the turbines. "And now where are we going?" Sarah  asked.</p><p>"Your  house, then back to mine," Dan said.</p><p>"What?"  Allison said.</p><p>"Your  parents are good people and they trust Jack. They'll let you stay with us for a  while."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Someone  tried to kill you today.  We need to stay  together, all of us."</p><p>"Um  wasn't I the one imprinted," Ranma said.</p><p>"Yes,  but if we're separated it'll be easier to get us.  Divide and conquer."</p><p>"Do you  really think whoever did that to Ranma wants to kill us?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"You  fought that golem," Dan said "But the biggest problem is that we don't know  anything.  We have no idea who did this  or why."</p><p>After  stopping at the Allison's house and having a brief argument as to where Allison  would sleep.  She normally used the room  Ranma currently occupied.  They arrived  back at the O'Neill residence.</p><p>"Why do  I have to stay in your room, again?" Ranma asked Sarah.  They were both up at the range.  After arriving home, Ranma was relived to  find that she still could change back with water, although any attempts to  change at will simply activated her template.</p><p>"It  would be inappropriate for Allison to stay in Dan's room," Sarah said at the  hawk block.</p><p>"Um,  can't she turn invisible."</p><p>"Yes I  realize the futility of it," Sarah said letting the hatchet go.  It   embedded itself in the wood.</p><p>"So I  can practice up here?" he asked looking around.   This was the only flat grassy area on the property</p><p>Sarah  walked up to the block and pulled out her hatchet and the knife she had thrown  earlier, "Yeah, just be sure to check the flag and then look to make sure no  one's up her, and if they are never cross the line," she said pointing to the  firing line.</p><p>"Sean  send those records awfully fast."</p><p>"Well  yeah he doesn't want us to hurt him.  Not  that they were very helpful.  All we know  now is that Spore's most likely from Germany  and that that hacker was REALLY good.   Good enough to change the original template pass codes.  Now as to why some German guy would know  Calash, let alone make a template off of our body as still unknown.  Of course that location could be a fake.  But know we have to find two people if we  want to get the codes."</p><p>"So we  know less than before we got to Sean."</p><p>"Well  at least things will be interesting for a while," Sarah said, tossing her  knife.</p><p>"Yeah  my glass is half full," Ranma said sarcastically.</p><p>"That's  the spirit."</p><p>Authors note:  Before  any "Invisible Man" fans bug me about it yes I know all about quicksilver  madness. Allison just hasn't used the gland enough to warrant a shot of counteragent  yet. In future chapters she will.</p><p>Additional note: EPS (electron pulse saturation) is a  fictional weapon taken from "The Precept" by Jack Moody,  it acts similar to an EMP burst, except much  more localized.</p>
