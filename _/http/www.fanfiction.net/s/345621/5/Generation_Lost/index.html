</div><p>Chapter 5 - Beta Patches and  Upgrades</p><p>"Why don't you eliminate  the entire Narn homeworld while you're at it?" Babylon 5, Season 5 Intro.</p><p>Ranma  snapped back to consciousness.  It was like s a switch was flipped and  suddenly her mind was up and running.  Which  on a certain level was entirely accurate.   Her eyes were closed, but she could feel wings and was therefore still  in template.  Opening her eyes  she saw that she was laying  on a couch   in the den of the O'Neil place.  A  quick glance at her clothing made it apparent that some other  minor changes had happened to her template,  the new choker was especially aggravating.    She turned to see someone sitting in a recliner near the couch.  "What the hell are you doing here?"</p><p>"Hey  Ranma," Gosunkugi said, in English.   "We've got some things we need to talk about."  He then looked at the, I/O sphere connected,  laptop resting on the end table next to his chair.  Strangely he only looked at the screen, and  didn't touch anything.</p><p>From  the kitchen a girl's voice, Ranma didn't recognize, said in a slight Boston  accent  "Hey he's up."</p><p>Ranma  noticed something odd, Gos didn't appear to be denting the cushions to his  chair, it was as if he was just <i> barely</i>  floating. Shrugging she shifted out of template and into that dreadful uniform  Allison had tricked her into.</p><p>"Shut  up," Ranma replied after Gos raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Now  what did I tell you about acting perverted," the same voice form the kitchen  said.</p><p>"What  is going on?" Ranma asked evenly.  "Why  are <i>you</i> here?"</p><p>"Think  about it," the pale boy responded.</p><p>Then  it hit her.  Spore, the Japanese account,  the modeling of the template.  "You! You  did this!" Ranma growled.</p><p>"Hey  all I did was write the damn thing,   someone else stole it and installed it."</p><p>Ranma  paused, "Yes but, how-why," she stammered.   "I mean you're Gosunkugi."</p><p>He  chuckled, "Yes I'm supposed to be some hopelessly inept, Akane obsessed, wanabe  mage."</p><p>"And  you're not."</p><p>"Not  anymore, I was given a gift, something that changed my life."</p><p>"Like  getting an I/O sphere from that drunk is so great." The voice from the kitchen  said.</p><p>"If  wasn't for that 'drunk' you wouldn't even exist," Gos responded.</p><p>"I  am not a drunk." Another voice from in the kitchen said.</p><p>"Is  that Reno?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Yeah,  he's helping Allison and Sarah fix Dan's arm."</p><p>"So  who's that other girl?" Ranma asked finally sitting up.</p><p>"Erika  Berkley," the girl said walking in.  She  was wearing a black leotard, black boots, and a chainmail skirt.  Her deep blue hair went freely down to her shoulder  blades.</p><p>"I  told her to wear something a little inconspicuous, but no," Gos said, then  sighed   "At least she looks hot."</p><p>"My  little perv," Erika smiled.</p><p>Ranma  was busy trying to absorb the information.   Gosunkugi was real wizard, had built that damned temp, <i>and</i> was  having a semi-normal conversation with a girl.</p><p>"Come  on, it makes a lot of sense when you think about it," Erika stated, "Ever  wonder why Gos was always so pale?"</p><p>"Not  really," Ranma said looking over at him, some<i>thing</i> was definitely off  about him.</p><p>"It's  because I spent every free moment wandering around databases, servers, and just  about every system I could hack.  That's  why I got the I/O sphere in the first place.   I cleared up a little tax problem for Germ Forge, Reno, a year ago and  he gave one to me in return."</p><p>"Wait,  if you knew Calash all this time,  then  how come you didn't do anything.  If you  could make templates and stuff, then how come you were only a minimal player in  the Nerima madness?"<br/>"Because while anyone can  write the code and do the basic I/O functions, only a select few can install or  remove magical apps. I was not one of them, until recently."</p><p>Noticing  Ranma's lack of response, Erika sighed and asked, "And how did you get that  ability?"</p><p>"Well  I couldn't have done it without your help."</p><p>"Why,  what did she do?" Ranma yawned</p><p>Gos  smiled, just before disappearing.</p><p>Ranma turned to Erika, "What the hell just  happened?"</p><p>Erika just smiled, and shifted…</p><p>into  and exact duplicate of Gos, down to the jeans, and the white t-shirt with the  words L33T M3 written on it. "Erika did modify the curse a bit."</p><p>Ranma  looked down, then back up. "What, just happened?" she asked.</p><p>"That  me over there was just a projection," Gos said pointing to the chair.</p><p>"And  Erika's what?"</p><p>"Yeah  about that, see there're two people in here," Gos said pointing to himself.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Um  yeah," Gos said looking over to the side, "Looks like, I'll have to tell that  damn story all over again." Gos paused, then after a couple of seconds rolled  his eyes, "Well yes, story time <i>could</i> have waited till she woke up, but  I thought and explanation as to why we were waiting at their front door was  necessary."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Not  you.   I was talking to Erika."</p><p>"The  girl that was just here."</p><p>Gos  nodded.</p><p>"So  she's a voice in your head."</p><p>"Not  exactly. Look lets go outside and I'll explain everything."</p><p>"Why there?"</p><p>"Because,"  Gos said leveling his voice, "some of the information you'll want to dispense  at your own discretion."</p><p>"Nerima?"</p><p>"Some  of it."</p><p>"Okay  just let me change out of this god awful thing." Ranma said before walking into  the living room and running up the stairs.</p><p>Gos  tuned to see Sarah leaning in the doorway between the den and the kitchen.<br/>"I'll be watching," she  said her eyes narrowing.</p><p>"As  you should," was Gos' reply.</p><p>Ranma  came down shortly, male, and wearing black pants and red shirt. "Let's go," he  said to the apparently competent mage.</p><p>"Communist,"  Sarah coughed.</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>"No,  no, no" Gos interjected while shutting down his laptop, "The red shirt means he  dies first."</p><p>"Oh  god you're a trekkie," Sarah moaned.</p><p>"A  little, what scifi do <i>you </i>watch?"</p><p>"Babylon  mostly."</p><p>"Ah, B5 no that's a good show."</p><p>"Um,  Gos weren't we going for a walk," Ranma interrupted. "You two can talk about the  Evil Empire latter."</p><p>"Hey  don't be bringing Star Wars into this," Gos stated.</p><p>"No,  he's talking about the Soviets."</p><p>"I  give up," Ranma groaned pushing past them into the kitchen. Inside he saw Reno,  Allison and Dan at the table.  Dan was in  his template, his severed arm flush with the stump.  Two laptops were running, both hooked up to  an I/O sphere with  Alison operating  both.   Sean had a set of jewelers  magnifiers over his eyes, and was manipulating small instruments in the small  gulf between cuts.</p><p>Sean  stopped his manipulations, "Next connection."</p><p>"Wait, let's see if this one works," Allison  said.</p><p>"Right."</p><p>"On my mark test it," Dan said closing his  eyes and gritting his teeth in case the system shorted.</p><p>"Queuing muscular supplement, sub-conduit  489," Allison read off one of her screens.</p><p>"Hit it."   The newly connected cybernetics activated entering their test mode to  see if the new parts had been configured correctly.  The minute signals bounced around with  increasing complexity, an if there had been and error it would have caused  noticeable damage, for Dan's template unlike Ranma's could not enter a 'safe'  mode and debug/repair itself.</p><p>"Clear," Allison said, to Dan's relief.</p><p>"What's going on?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Remember when I got hit with the blade during  the fight."</p><p>"Oh yeah," Ranma recalled, that's why he was  asleep in that thing.  Ranma vaguely  recalled being hit by and explosion at the end of the fight. "I thought you  could heal injuries, like the terminator."</p><p>"Well a deep cut and a full amputation are  different things, and addition there was much more damage to my endoskeleton  and various other components than I originally thought." Then turning to  Allison "Next?"</p><p>The blonde scrolled through the arm assembly  schematics. "The core structure had been rebuilt along with three of the five  conduits, after that its just minor musculature and skin repairs."</p><p>"There's two more of these dammed things."  Sean groaned, switching his tools. "Dan, you've got to put in better wetware."</p><p>"Yes, I'm aware of that, but recoding my  entire architecture will take too long, and I need an operational template as  soon as possible."</p><p>"True," Sean allowed.</p><p>"Let's go," Gos said,  a laptop satchel slung at his side.</p><p>"Where's Sarah?" Ranma asked, looking into the  empty den.</p><p>"Oh around," Gos replied.</p><p>They exited the house using the back door,  walking up the worn path to the  range.  Gos looked at the level green field, and then turned to the wedge of sky  visible above the clearing. "Look's like rain."</p><p>"Yup," Ranma replied.</p><p>"Been a mild fall?"</p><p>"So far, but that means that winter will hit  even harder."</p><p>"Well we are in the mountains.  What a mile above sea level?" He inhaled,  "Air's thinner up here, that been affecting your flying?"</p><p>"No.  Look can we get past the small talk?"</p><p>"Right  which first, Erika or your temp?"</p><p>"They're  interconnected aren't they"</p><p>"Yup,  I guess I'll go further back then.  Most  of my life was spent in shame, afraid of other people.  You know that standard withdrawn loner crap.  Coupled with Japan's reverence for  conformity, my only outlet became computers.   Eventually I fell in with certain groups, and found out that I possessed  L33T SKILLZ.  I specialized in getting  onto government systems.  That's how I  fixed Forge's tax problem. Shortly after that I got a package from New Zealand,  my first I/O sphere.</p><p>"But  as you know I failed to have the potential.   That didn't stop me from learning Calash, coding some templates, and  taking scans of local phenomenon.  I had  a couple templates each fitted to various locals.  But I got bored with them before they were  finished."</p><p>"Why'd  you make them? I mean  if they got out…"  Ranma trailed.</p><p>"Yes  it could have been quite bad.  That's why  I transferred them off my machine just in case."</p><p>"And then Forge's archives got hacked, and she  got all your early templates."</p><p>"Yes, but yours was the only one close to  completion, the rest were just outlines and skeletal codlings and such.  After my falling out with Calash, I wandered  around the 'net looking for something interesting, and I found it in artificial  intelligence."</p><p>"Erika?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Not quite yet. You see I had broken into the  top research facilities in the field, universities, corporations both civil and  military contractors and government projects.   It was relatively easy, well compared to the IRS, because the complexity  in any half decent AI necessitated a lot of external networking.  Once I was in I looked around taking pieces  from dozens of teams and connecting them, and then it happened."</p><p>"It couldn't have been that simple."</p><p>"You'd be amazed at what cutting edge  technology can do, it is almost on par with Calash, and magic. And when you  combine them."</p><p>"So what is Erika?"</p><p>"A living sentient person just like you or me,  she's also my girlfriend."</p><p>Ranma, stepped back a little trying to wrap  his brain around the previous statement. "So you were so desperate for  companionship, that you broke dozens of laws and made an unparalleled  scientific breakthrough. Just to get a girl that would like you."</p><p>"Yup sounds  pretty damn sad," Gos agreed.</p><p>"And  how did you move her from all those computers to <i>inside</i> your head?  Especially since you couldn't even use Calash"</p><p>"It  all started when Forge told me about being attacked by four people, one of them  a winged Japanese redhead wearing a fuku. This put all the pieces into  place.  Where you'd gone to.  How I could actually use Calash.  What I should do with my life.  How I could help Erika. It was all there."</p><p>"In  one simple message," Ranma said skeptically.</p><p>"Yes  you see, It had to be you, because that was a template I made for your girl  side, and once I got out of Forge where he lived I knew where you had  gone.  Lockridge made a lot of sense.</p><p>"Now  how I actually got access to Clash, that was entirely Erika's work. By reverse  engineering the I/O sphere she discovered the requirements necessary for  potential.  Why some can use Clash while  others can't.   With this information,  she then altered a copy of the Clash interpreter, broadening  the user requirements.</p><p>"It  made it so that I could just barely use this version of Clash.  It was very slow and inefficient, by my foot  was in the door.  Erika then loaded an  app into me that simulated some of the properties of potential.  This made the connection a bit better, like  tying a coat hanger to and old TV antenna.   She was then able to refine the user requirements, again making the  connection better.  Think of a  microphone, you can place it in the middle of the room and hear a little bit  from everyone, or put it in front of a single person and hear everything he's  saying.  If you know where he is, you can  get closer to him.</p><p>"Likewise, as  she refined the requirements she was able to cut out more and more of the  background noise, while expanding my ability to connect to the sphere.  With each cycle of upgrades, my abilities got  better, until I had essentially the same skills as you or Sarah."</p><p>"Could  others get potential this way?" Ranma asked, catching only the gist of it:  Erika made it so that Gos could use Calash.</p><p>"No.  Unless they had someone like Erika doing it for them. Hell, even if someone had  copies of my adapter programs, they couldn't do it.  The code itself is useless, it's the process  that's important. Even the procedure of expansion and refinement is different  for everyone.   Having potential is  essentially the ability to connect to an I/O sphere.</p><p>"If  you don't have potential you can't connect, and the possible reasons for this are  numerous and complicated.  That's why only  certain people have the right combination of characteristics that allows this  connection."</p><p>"So  how'd I get my potential?" Ranma asked, again getting some of what Gos had  said.</p><p>"Erika  thinks its hereditary(look at Lockridge).  So probably from you mother, Sarah's an  example. Wait, but her father also has it.   And  then there's the mater of why you mother even had potential in the first place.  Well she did end up here, but that brings up  another point…"</p><p>Ranma  glazed over, as Gos began to ramble.   Before Ranma had tired to listen to what the pale boy was saying: it  might have made sense.  But Ranma knew what  Gos was saying was just dull, and  not Gos  talking over his head.  "Yes that's nice  and all but could you get back to you little story about Erika?" Ranma said interrupting  Gos' amazingly dry monologue about genealogy and migration patterns.</p><p>"Oh  right sure, after I got potential I was able to load a vessel that Erika had  constructed in Clash that could contain her.    After she transferred herself into me all that was left was to curse  myself, to give her a body."</p><p>"But  how'd you even get cursed water?"</p><p>"Oh  I didn't need the water, remember back when I scanned you, that's when I got a  copy of the curse.  I then transferred it  to myself after Erika had modified the install commands to allow for my girl  form to be fitted to her specifications."</p><p>"I  thought Jusenkyou was a different class of magic from Clash."</p><p>"It  is," Gos said switching his bag to the other shoulder. "But she didn't have to  decode the curse.  She just encapsulated  the Jusenkyou code in Calash to upgrade it."</p><p>"To  get the changing at will and separate clothing for each form." Ranma observed.</p><p>"Yes  both are rather easy.  When a template  loads your clothing  changes, right, so  all you have to do is each time the curse triggers it saves the current state  and loads the previous one.  It also  works for other things.  You've seen how  my hair is much shorter than Erika's.   And the control switching was a simple program that override the trigger  response."</p><p>Ranma  nodded slightly, then spoke, "Two questions: Are you separate people? and Why'd  you do this, let someone else in you body?"</p><p>"First  yes we are two separate individuals, we just happened to be rooming so to  speak.  And as for why consider loneliness.    Back in Nerima I was alone, as I'd  gather were you too.   Think of what I  created. Erika is the only one of her kind.   And as she grew she realized what she'd been denied, and what she could  never experience.</p><p>"I  <i>had</i> to help her.  It would have  been immeasurably cruel to leave her confined to servers.  True she is a vast web of linked programs,  but she had a soul. But now at least some of the time she has a body. And the  time I spend just seeing from cameras and hearing from microphones, existing as  a projection, can help me understand her."</p><p>"And  Akane?"</p><p>Gos  narrowed his eyes, "A simple crush.  A  pathetic, sad, and powerful crush.  She  messed us both up." He recalled bitterly,   "but that part of my life is over.   I've escaped Nerima, much like you."</p><p>"How'd you  manage that, aren't you parents still alive?"</p><p>"Ah  but they're dead to me.  They read the  acceptance letters, they practically pushed me onto the plane."</p><p>"Dead?  Letters?"</p><p>"My  parents were yuppies, self centered brats.   I swear they had me because some magazine said it was the latest  fad.   They had some decency, I mean they  did keep me around, but they had no compunction about sending me to some  academy in Seattle, provided that I had a full scholarship of course."</p><p>"How'd  you manage that?"</p><p>"Same  way I made Erika a US citizen.  I hacked  into their records."</p><p>"What  if they call?"</p><p>"They  won't and even if they did it's covered," Gos assured. "I have friends in that  city, granted I wouldn't recognize them if I met them on the street but that's  how it goes."</p><p>Raman  absorbed the facts, Gosunkugi was a mage, had a girlfriend, and had friends  loyal to him.  "You've changed."</p><p>"No  I was always the same, but I was afraid to show it, to know it." Gos sighed.  "And now we move past what  I have told  your family(the one here, your real one), and into what is for you alone."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"The  true nature of your template, and the movements in Nerima."</p><p>"Nerima  first."</p><p>"Right,  Nabiki has organized the others.  Until  they find you they will work together."</p><p>"Who's  they?"</p><p>"The  Amazons, The Kunos,  Nabiki, Akane."</p><p>"I'm  surprised Akane's with them, I thought she'd be glad to be rid of me."</p><p>"She's  spoiled.  Just like the others she won't  leave you alone, but she <i>will</i> deny it," Gos said his voice gaining and  edge.  He then regained his composure,  "Two are missing. Ukyou and Ryouga.   Shortly after you finished Cologne's language lessons (an admirable  ploy), Ukyou closed her shop and moved away.   Ukyou told the others that when her father heard of Genma's demise and  your disappearance, he annulled both the engagement and the vendetta, and  recalled his child. Whether or not this is just a ruse and she is striking out  on her own-"</p><p>Ranma  cut him off, "She is not coming for me.   She is the only one there who I told where I went.  If she was after me she would already be  here."</p><p>"It's  a big risk."</p><p>"I  trust her.  I had to tell <i>someone</i>  where I was going."</p><p>"It  is not a question of trust but of desperation.    What if the others think that Ukyou knows something.  The amazons have ways of making people talk,  and they will not relent."</p><p>Ranma  recalled being chased across China, and the mind-bending properties of a  certain hair care product.</p><p>"Ryouga  as always wanders, and may show up at inopportune times.  But I have prepared a diversion.  Nabiki knows I am in Seattle, and if she were  to search online newspaper archives, she would find a handful of articles and  blurbs.  Rumors have also been  constructed.  They will arrive in the  city, and spend their time chasing shadows."</p><p>"And  if this ploy fails, and they find Lockridge?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Then  we will be more than prepared for their arrival," Gos said his eyes narrowing.</p><p>"Easy  for you to say.  They're after me."</p><p>"Yes,  but Nabiki reigns the hounds, and I angered her greatly when I left.  For I know where you are, am beyond her power,  and threatened her money."</p><p>"Oh,"  Ranma responded.</p><p>"Do  not worry for I have many eyes and see many things.  Even now my associates track their movements"  Gos chuckled, "Ah the power of technology."</p><p>"Alright  <i>now</i> you're back to being the pale creepy guy."</p><p>Gos  laughed, "Good, and now to your template."</p><p>"What  about it?" Ranma asked knowing that the answers would be unpleasant.</p><p>"I  never finished your template.  It had to  have been completed by the person that stole it." Gos paused, then muttering to  himself, or more likely Erika, "Are you absolutely sure? Yes I know you scanned  but.  Alright, yes.  But you know what that means.  Fine."   He looked at Ranma, "During the last fight, you activated some magical  artifacts, right."</p><p>"Yeah, those damn compact and glasses.  Well I guess you put those things in to  complete the magical girl look right."</p><p>"Nope.   I never got far enough to put accessories in."</p><p>"So  the hacker put them in."</p><p>"I  hope so."</p><p>"What  does that mean?"</p><p>"Your  costume also changed."</p><p>"Yeah  that stupid choker was gouging into my neck."</p><p>"What  do you expect you have an egg sized chunk of glass in your throat.  Erika recall those images." Gos said holding  his hands out flat."  Appearing on  each was a   small projection of Ranma's template.   "The one on the left I got from Sarah, after she changed the colors, the  day you were imprinted. The other is from just before you woke up. Notice any  differences." He said pointing to the two miniature winged girls.</p><p>"Roses,"  he observed flatly.</p><p>"Yup  it seems to have become your motif, in rose jewelry, rose accents, and other  things of that sort. It fits the Rose Glasses and  the Rose Hand Mirror."</p><p>"And  you weren't behind this either."</p><p>"Nope,  I'm hoping that that was just a triggered effect, to be set off when you  activated the artifacts.  The alternative  isn't good, for any of us" Gos said dismissing the holograms.</p><p>"Why."</p><p>"First  of all it means that our hacker managed to get into Erika's personal files,  recently. This is not outside the realm of possibilities, after all she did  manage to defeat the security at Forge's Germany site and alter the template's  original pass codes.  But more  importantly is was what she could have gotten."</p><p>"How  do you know she was even there."</p><p>"I  have my ways."</p><p>"Damn  it! Why to you people always say that?"</p><p>"Now  that… is a-"</p><p>"Don't,"  Ranma interrupted.</p><p>"Fine.  Well any way, if she stole what I think she did, and put it in your template  sometime before that fight, then it's a miracle you're still alive."</p><p>"I  just keeps getting better," Ranma groaned.</p><p>"For  the last month Erika's been fiddling with Organic Technology."</p><p>"And  that's?"</p><p>"Here's  the concept, say you're in a fight, and you need something.  It can be anything,  weapons, systems, parts, upgrades,  additions.  The template itself will do  that for you.  It will help you  automatically, responding to problems immediately."</p><p>"But  isn't a template really hard to program."</p><p>"Yes  it is, that's the problem, there are too may variables. It takes a person hours  sometimes days to upgrade a template.   Look at Dan, he's got two other people working on him for an hour, and  he just got an arm chopped off."</p><p>"Wait  so you're saying that my template upgraded itself: making those artifacts and  adding in the roses," Ranma said skeptically.</p><p>"And  some new bracer attacks," Gos added. "But let me finish. Since it takes a  thinking mind to code a template, Erika reasoned that all she had to do is put  an AI in the template.  So she copied  some of her protocols and tailored them to the task of template upgrading."</p><p>"So  it's like a little programmer in your head."</p><p>"Exactly.  Well it's not quite conscious,  but it is a <i>very</i> powerful program.  The  problem comes in with speed.  Even the  L33test coders make mistakes.  And since  organic tech had the code written on the spot, there's a lot of typos. And in  Calash bugs have hideous effects."</p><p>"Why  aren't the errors fixed before it's installed."</p><p>"How  do you know there's a problem unless something wrong happens, and there isn't  time for a trial run."</p><p>"Walked  into that one. So why am I lucky to be alive?"</p><p>"I've  been talking in theoretical terms, as to how organic tech should work.  Even under the most idea circumstances,  there'd be some problems.  Hell, Erika  had only run a few tests before it was stolen.   Who knew what it'd do in a live subject?   That you just passed out for a while is really good," Gos then paused.</p><p>Ranma  sighed. "You're going to make me ask another question.  Why can't you just keep your little monologue  running on your own?"</p><p>"It  means that the AI was able to repair all of the bugs, while keeping the errors  from spreading.   The problems could have  cascaded out of control, putting you in a coma or killing you.  The good news is that this probably won't  happen again, as time passes the AI in the organic code will grow and get  better."</p><p>"Probably?"  Ranma said.</p><p>"That  is even if you have the damned thing." Gos pointed.  "I need your help to run a few more tests."</p><p>"Right."  Ranma sighed. "This hacker's a real big problem."</p><p>"Oh  yeah, she's our next priority," Gos said glad that they were done with <i>that</i> subject, especially since Ranma  never asked exactly how the Organic tech got the required information off of  its user, or the self upgrading abilities of the AI itself.</p><p>"Is  that it?"</p><p>"That's  it"</p><p>"Why  didn't you want the others to hear about organic tech or Nerima?" Ranma asked,  walking back to the path.</p><p>"I  wanted you to make the choice to tell them yourself.  I'm not sure about the organic yet and it might  worry them.  It's a lot like artificial  intelligence, legendary, very hard, but unlike it potentially dangerous.</p><p>"And Nerima, I want to avoid a confrontation  between the old crew and the new crew.   In Nerima fighting is something that you can always recover from.  It has no consequence.  But here it does,  you've seen the weapons  they carry. If it came down to a fight,  especially for you,  they would use  lethal force. It'd be like the scene in that Indiana Jones movie. You know  where when against that swordfighter Indy simply shot him."</p><p>Ranma's  mind was filled with jumbled images of   what could happen.  One group of  violent loons versus another group, slightly saner but much more lethal.  The first group would be desperate, unstable  and had a history of jumping to wild conclusions, the other would protect  themselves using whatever means necessary.   The presence of someone bearing a close resemblance to his girl side  would not help things along.</p><p>"Sarah," Ranma finally said.</p><p>"Yes,  unless you know where to look you two are identical. And don't forget the  language barrier."</p><p>"I  can see why you sent them to Seattle. I agree they must never meet, but I'll  have to tell Sarah and the rest what's going on.  So they'll be prepared."</p><p>"As  you wish, but if cornered they will defend themselves," Gos paused, then added  "and you."</p><p>"I  know," Ranma said his mouth dry</p><p>"And  the organic tech?"</p><p>"Sure  why not," Ranma said beginning to walk down the path, turning to see if Gos was  following him. "What are you looking at?"   he asked following the pale hacker's gaze. He was looking at a darkened  shape in a second floor window.  There  was also a slight glint from a what looked to be a very small piece of circular  glass.  "Is that Sarah? She was watching  us"</p><p>"Yes,"  Gos replied, "I believe that she was watching to see if I would attack you."</p><p>Ranma  looked blankly.</p><p>"It  makes sense, things have been dangerous lately.   Only this morning you were attacked by a mech.  As I've said before your friends here would  kill for you."</p><p>"You  didn't mind?"</p><p>"Unlike  others, Sarah knows that some things can never be taken back.  She would not act blindly.  So no I don't mind, Erika was a bit miffed,  but that's understandable," Gos replied, then appended, "Besides someone is  always watching."</p><p>Ranma  considered the riddle.  There were other  reasons for having this discussion outside.</p><p>"Boss?"  the deputy asked knocking on the door to the  Sheriff's office.</p><p>"Come  in Ted," Jack replied, looming up form his desk.</p><p>Deputy  Ted Johansen, a tall thin man walked into the office, the only distinguishing  aspect of his face was a  moustache and  goatee  he'd grown.  "You comin' to the Wolf for a bite?"</p><p>Jack  looked at his watch. "Sure," he said   getting up.  Putting his coat on  he followed the younger deputy out to the front door. They passed the front  desk where the other deputy was playing a text based RPG, at his desktop. "Damn  grue," he muttered.</p><p>"Still  playing that game Bill?" Johansen asked.</p><p>The  other deputy, Bill Warwick, "Yup, nothing much else to do."</p><p>"That's'  good news in our line of work," Johansen joked, "Sheriff and I are going to get  some lunch.  Want us to bring somethin'  back?"</p><p>"Sure,  the usual," Warwick replied.</p><p>The  two police officers left the station, and walked down the street to the Wolfe's  Head Bar and Grill, one of the few business in the small town. On the main  street it was a few buildings down from the police station.  It was a multistory building faced in wood  planking with apartments on the second and third floors.  When they entered Johansen sat down at the  bar counter and ordered his and the other deputy's food.  Jack simply said: the usual.</p><p>"Sheriff  O'Neil there you are," said a voice from one of the booths.</p><p>Jack  looked to see Judy Miller the high school's vice principle.  Looking at the glasses on her table it was  apparent that she'd had more than a few.</p><p>"I  took the rest of day off," she said defensively.  "The teachers can be flakes so why can't I.  Anyway you'd have quit early if you'd have my day."</p><p>Jack  raised and eyebrow.</p><p>"It's  those damn daughters of yours, always horsing around.  Although the other one's new.   Stupid kids, screwin' with the records. Is  it too hard for them to be <i>normal</i>?" the drunken administrator whined.</p><p>"What  happened," Jack asked speaking for the first time.</p><p>"On  nothing, just some fight tore up the back fields and filled it with hunks of  metal.  I come out to see what going on  and, what happens, your girls that Arzish boy and his girl run off."</p><p>Carrying  dinks and three boxes, Johansen walked up next to the sheriff and said,  "Miller's been hitting the sauce again."</p><p>"She  do this often?" O'Neil asked.</p><p>"Every  couple months something strange  rubs her  the wrong way.  She's good at her job,  that's the problem.  She cares enough to  try and run a tight ship, and well around these parts, especially with the  youngsters, that's raring for trouble," the deputy then turned to the  bartender.  "Make sure someone drives her  home."</p><p>Always  do, was the response.  Jack then pulled  out his cell phone.  He had a few calls  to make.</p><p>Sarah  and Allison were in the kitchen cleaning up the equipment used to fix Dan's  arm.  Sean had ran out of the house  shortly after finishing the repair, remembering that while his boss had allowed  him to come in late today (so he could pick up Gos and Erika up at the airport  in Casper) he was due in at noon.  Dan  not having slept recently decided to go to his room to take a nap.  Leaving Ranma with Erika and Gos in the next  room.   They were examining code from  Ranma's template, when the ringing of a phone interrupted them.</p><p>"That  yours?"  Ranma asked, in female from,  having just reverted out of template.</p><p>Holo-Gos  looked at Erika, who shook her head. "Nope," he replied.</p><p>"It's  mine," Sarah shouted from the kitchen.</p><p>"Answer  it," Ranma said annoyed at the insensate ringing.</p><p>"Fine."  Sarah walked into the room and picked it up.   Answering it, "Oh hi dad.  Well  yeah that did happen.  No we're all  fine.  Well Dan got a little hurt, but  he's better now.  Yes I know.  Again we are all okay.  Alright bye," Sarah clicked the phone  off.  "That's odd."</p><p>"What?  Jack's bound to find out about the fight."</p><p>"Yeah  but this soon.  Eh doesn't matter," she  said about to put the phone down.</p><p>Gos  was looking at the device, "Wait, isn't that a remote control."</p><p>"Used  to be," Sarah remarked.</p><p>"Oh  can I see it?"</p><p>"Sure"  she said tossing it as Gos' head.  Where  it passed through and would have hit the floor, if Erika hadn't caught it.</p><p>"I'm  the projection now," Gos exclaimed, "Is it that hard to see?"</p><p>"Actually  it is,"  Sarah replied.  "Maybe you should have a nice 'H' on your  forehead."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"She  has a point," Erika said. "I mean we do use light bees."</p><p>Noticing  Ranma's puzzlement, "Sorry that's from and old British scifi comedy. A light  bee is a small device that projects my image and allows me to see, hear, and  talk."</p><p>"Makes  sense."</p><p>"Interesting,"  Gos observed looking at the modified remote Erika was holding up to his face.</p><p>"Eh,  I was bored," Sarah commented.</p><p>"No,  there's good work in this," he said looking at the phone. "The antenna assembly  is especially clever."</p><p>"Can  we get back to the template?" Ranma said.</p><p>Erika  put the remote next to her laptop, "Okay fine, I can't break the pass codes."</p><p>"What?"  Ranma stammered. "But you're some type of super computer. Why can't you do it?  It was done before."</p><p>"As  much as I admire the high regard you have for my skills.  I'm not omnipotent.  Our little hacker broke into an incomplete  template, a much easier thing to do than a finished one.  In addition she put in some pretty heavy  encryption."</p><p>"Just  great."</p><p>"Don't  worry I took some readings to figure out how the algorithms work.  And if anyone's gonna break it I will."</p><p>"Alright  so next we have those new artifacts. I'm afraid you gonna have to go into  template again."</p><p>Ranma  sighed, and shifted.</p><p>After  the flash died down, Erika looked at fuku and said, "You're such a perv."</p><p>"Hey,  the hacker could have shortened the skirt or made her cleavage visible," Gos  said indignantly.</p><p>"Yes  but we know the hacker was a girl." Erika replied.</p><p>"Again,  how do you people know that?" the winged pseudo magical girl asked.</p><p>"So  what if she was a girl?" Allison stated, ignoring Ranma's question.</p><p>"Yes  we all know that wouldn't be a problem for you," Sarah commented. She then looked  around realizing that Erika and Gos didn't know Allison, and that her brother,  or sister, was a little clueless.</p><p>"Yes,  why don't you tell us why that's not a problem for me." Allison smiled.</p><p>Sarah  grumbled and went back into he kitchen.   Allison then leaned on the wall off to the side.</p><p>"Alright  Ranma, summon those things," Erika said watching the incoming feed from her I/O  sphere.</p><p>"Rose  Compact activate,  Rose Glasses,  activate." Ranma muttered, hoping that this time someone would be able to help  her.</p><p>"Interesting,  see how the recall command works." Erika said.</p><p>"Where  the hell is that data stored then?" Gos said.</p><p>"It  seems to be in the priority section, damn," then turning to Ranma, "Can I see  those things?"</p><p>"Sure,"  Ranma said, taking off the rose sunglasses. The sensor overlay they gave off  was a bit disorientating, especially when she looked at Gos.  The projection was very good, possessing an  immense poly count, and to the unaided human eye indistinguishable from a real  person.  But whatever sensors served her  template could see through the   projection and made Gos semi-transparent. She could even see the little  robot flying inside his head.</p><p>"Wow  the hacker does nice work," Erika commented fiddling with the glasses.</p><p>"Or  you did," Gos said.</p><p>"I'm  not sure this is the work of organic tech," she said opening the compact.  "Hello there," she said filling with some of the buttons on the lower section,  while gazing at the mirror. "It's like a palm," she observed.</p><p>"Can  you find any temp controls?" Gos asked, looking at the little computer slash  makeup compact.</p><p>Holding  it like a gameboy Erika scrolled through the options and windows. "No just the  general colors and stuff."</p><p>"Can  you make it less intense?" Ranma asked, stretching.  "Stupid wings, No can't be comfortable in a  chair," she thought.</p><p>"Nope.  Surprisingly, it's at the least garish  settings." Erika said.</p><p>Ranma  shuddered remembering that the template original made everything pink and  glittery.  She shuddered again at the  prospect that it could even get worse than <i>that</i>.   Compared to that is started out as, the  roses weren't that bad. "God that's depressing," she remarked internally.</p><p>"Find  anything else useful?" Gos asked.</p><p>"Not  really.  I'm archiving the data  nonetheless. It might come in handy later," Erika said looking up from the  compact. She sighed, "You know Ranma you really should cross your legs."</p><p>"Well,  you are sitting right in front of her." Gos pointed out</p><p>"Hey,"  Erika said.</p><p>"Are  you done yet? I want out of this thing." Ranma said, trying not to freak out.  That little smile Allison had was especially disturbing.</p><p>"Sure  why not," Gos said.</p><p>Ranma  closed her eyes and reverted back to her default form.  The compact and glasses disappeared as well.  "That's better.  I really should blame  you for all this," she said to the hologram.</p><p>"Perhaps.  At least I can help make your curse easier to live with."</p><p>"So  I can change at will?"</p><p>"Yeah,  and it'll fix your clothes so you won't end up wearing a dress as a guy."</p><p>Allison  knew all about the upgrades to the curse, and the opportunity they presented.  "Hey Erika can I have a copy of the curse?" Allison asked pulling a zip disk  out of her purse.</p><p>"Okay,  why not?" she said, putting the offered disk into the drive.</p><p>After  the disk ejected, Allison grabbed the disk and ran out of the room and up the  stairs.</p><p>"I  think that was a very bad idea," Ranma observed.</p><p>"The  curse is easy enough to remove. What's the worst she could do."</p><p>"Why  must you constantly fail?" Rebecca asked, her irritation almost slipping out</p><p>"Huh?'  Ryouga responded.    They were sitting  across from each other at a table on the back porch of Rebecca's place.  He was wary at first, but as they talked he  realized that she was a kindred spirit.   She'd heard of Ranma and knew what kind of threat he possessed.  She confirmed his suspicions, provided  support for his theories. It only took a little coaxing and he told everything,  while she listened silently occasionally making a note on her laptop.  Being a world traveler the language problem  was minimized.  His accent was a strange  mix of Canadian and Japanese.</p><p>But  this question grated on him.  It seemed  out of place as if someone else was asking it.   Somewhere in his mind a little flag of warning popped up, but it was  quickly forgotten.</p><p>"I  apologize if my question was worded poorly," she said again in that pleasant  and understanding voice.  "It's just that  you seem to be just as good as this Ranma, perhaps even better, but he always  beats you.  From all the fights you've  told me, you haven't really ever won. I'd like to know why."</p><p>"I  see, once I know how he keeps beating me, I can counter and I'll win."</p><p>"Exactly,"  she smiled, careful to let him reach his own conclusions.</p><p>"I  already know what's wrong.  I turn into a  pig, and get lost easily."</p><p>"That  and you're a naïve, trusting, fool, with bipolar disorder; that'll spill his  guts quicker than a drunken Irishman in a confessional," Rebecca thought to  herself. If Rebecca had possessed any empathy she would have taken pity on his  rather pathetic loneliness and obsession.</p><p>Ryouga  was thinking.  According to Rebecca Ranma  had fled to Wyoming in order to find the colony of mages who lived in the  area.  Trying to find a cure for his  curse, and undoubtedly looking for ways to gain power.</p><p>The  lost boy was determined to bring this fiend to justice.  Ranma wasn't just a jerk, a simple enemy, a  bane to Ryouga's existence, he was also a murderer. Ranma had killed his father  when there was nothing left to learn from him, and ran off.  The coroner had said it was a heart attack,  but Ryouga knew that there were pressure points that could simulate that form  of death.  And Ranma's actions proved  that it wasn't a natural death.  Who  flees the country but a guilty man?</p><p>It  all made sense, all the pieces fit…</p><p>if  you were to make the right assumptions.   And this beyond any curse or handicap was Ryouga's failing.  It was the same blindness that the others in  Nerima shared.   Forcing evidence to fit  your irrational delusions.  A shortcoming  that Rebecca conveniently and consciously glossed over.</p><p>"But if I become free of those curses.  Then I will surely win."</p><p>"You stand a much better chance." Rebecca  allowed.</p><p>"But how will I be rid of them?" Ryouga asked,  knowing that he had a problem didn't solve it.</p><p>"Remember that colony of mages," Rebecca  offered.</p><p>"You're one of them."</p><p>"Yes, and I will help you. With my assistance  you will overcome your problems." Rebecca promised.</p><p>"But why will you help me?"</p><p>"If what you say is true then you are the  closest match to Ranma.  You are the only  person with hope of defeating him." Rebecca said, nor really answering his  question and technically not lying.</p><p>"So you want him beaten too, but I can't just  take you're help as a charity, I'll have to repay you."</p><p>"Oh you don't need to do that," Rebecca  replied,  Damn the fish was jumping right  into the boat.</p><p>"I insist.   There has to be some way I can help."</p><p>"If I think of something I'll tell you."</p><p>"Alright It's a deal"</p><p>"Good," Rebecca said leveling her gaze at him,  "there is much that needs to be done."</p><p>Some  will sell their souls for just about anything.   If Ryouga had been a more careful he wouldn't have used his as a  bargaining chip for a chance at revenge.</p><p>While  even Rebecca  herself has yet to grasp  the full implications of her actions. Things are building up.  Her hold on Ryouga is fragile now.   All he needs do is talk to anyone else, to  learn the truth, and her intricate web will fall apart.  Even a glimpse of what was on her screen  could have soured the deal.  On it was a  feed from one of her watchers, cloaked robots used for surveillance, among  other things</p><p>It  was monitoring the O'Neil place, and happened to recorded a conversation  between subject 1 and Spore, that arrogant self proclaimed hacker.   Rebecca knew that Spore was aware of her  presence.  His eyes kept going back to  where the watcher was.  The meant that  Spore wanted Rebecca to have this information.   It was a way of saying  that he  knew about the organic tech.</p><p>But  there was something else.  Yes Spore was  talking about the situation in Japan.  He  specifically mentioned that Ryouga was missing. Could he know that the lost boy  is here? Could he have been the one who sent him?</p><p>No  that was too paranoid.  It was simple  coincidence that she got subject, so why couldn't subject 2 fall into her lap  as well.</p><p>She  had to act fast if this were to work.</p><p>Ranma  was sitting on the floor munching on a bag of pretzels.  Unfortunately Ranma still needed water to  change and had gotten the bag while in the kitchen.  When he returned to the den, he'd found out  that Gos and Erika were in what used to be a, dining room, with Sarah.   They were fiddling with the bank of servers  in the room.  Well Erika and Sarah were  working Gos was watching and making comments.</p><p>Ranma's  technical knowledge had grown since he'd moved here (from virtually nothing to  the basics of usage) but the others were still light years ahead of him.  It was similar to the difference in ability  between Ranma and a non martial artist.</p><p>"So  when is Reno coming back?" Sarah asked hitting a hard drive with large pipe  wrench.</p><p>"Around  three." Gos said.</p><p>"You  shouldn't abuse components like that." Erika observed.</p><p>"It's  not my fault the case rusted to the bracket," Sarah grumbled, still smacking  the now warped drive. "Allison was the one that used this tower as a doorstop."</p><p>"That's  odd, but still," Gos said, imagining a tower case wedged in front of a door.</p><p>"It  was during a thunder storm."</p><p>"Oh-kay,"  Gos said.</p><p>"There's  something wrong with that girl," Erika noted putting the cover back on one of  the other computers in the server room.</p><p>"You  have no idea," Sarah said finally managing to pry the drive off. "So what does  Reno do?" she then asked.</p><p>"He's  the IT guy for a geological engineering and survey team," Gos said.</p><p>"Oh  why?"</p><p>"I  don't know why he works," Gos noted. "I think it's a way to keep the IRS off  his back."</p><p>"Wait,  wouldn't he be working to, you know, make money," Ranma said.</p><p>Gos  chuckled, "Come on Ranma. You think that any of us couldn't just <i>get</i>  money if we wanted too.  I can break into  the Internal Revenue Service or the Federal Reserve undetected. Do you honestly  think a bank would be that much of a problem"</p><p>"Or  if you prefer a less illegal approach, insider trading is nice.  It's amazing what you'll find on 'secure'  corporate servers," Sarah said.</p><p>"So  you get money illegally," Ranma said.</p><p>"Well  yeah," admitted Gos, "But come on, you break the law whenever you hack. You've  had your share of property damage and trespassing."</p><p>"Yes  but, nothing I ever did was a felony."</p><p>"What  about that time you ruptured a gas main."</p><p>"That  wasn't my fault."</p><p>Sarah  raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"You  don't want to know," Erika simply said.</p><p>"Isn't  it hypocritical for you to accuse your hacker of stealing from you when you've  stolen programs, information, and money," Ranma stated angrily.</p><p>"Chill  Ran-Man," a girl's voice said coming from the living room.</p><p>Ranma  turned around.  There was only one person  that used that nickname.  From the living  room came a girl in between Alison and Sarah in height, probably a hair taller  than Erika, with lose brown hair that came down to her neck, red eyes, and  wearing an oversized shirt that came to mid thigh showing of a very nice body.</p><p>"Dear  God," Sarah said.</p><p>"Allison  turned you into a girl. Why?" Ranma said.</p><p>"The  curse is not a toy." Gos said.</p><p>"Hey  I didn't do it.  Blame her," Dan said.</p><p>"You  are uninstalling it right?" Sarah asked.</p><p>"Probably  not," the neo-girl said.</p><p>"What!"  Ranma exclaimed. "Okay I still have it because without it I'd be a girl. Gos  has is because of Erika. But you don't need it."</p><p>"Oh  come on especially with that upgrade package of Gos'-"</p><p>"Hey  I wrote that," Erika interrupted.</p><p>"-sorry,  but the point is that now it's not a curse.   You can change at will and have none of the expected complications," Dan  said.  She then changed back returning to  her normal height, hair length, reddish brown eye tint, clothes and  gender.  "Erika you are a genius," he  said.</p><p>"Yeah  so," Erika said, of course she was smarter than these meat bags. "Oh can't  think that way, you're a meat bag to now, sometimes." She reminded herself.</p><p>"Wait  you like being a girl." Ranma said skeptically. "Shouldn't you be pissed at  this latest prank of Allison's?"</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>"In  the name of buddy Christ, NO," Sarah said figuring it out.</p><p>"It's  not like that," Dan said.</p><p>"Yes  it is.  Allison turned you into a girl  for the sex!" she exclaimed.</p><p>"That  would explain why he's okay with it," Gos observed.</p><p>Erika  glared at him.</p><p>"Sorry,  but you know…" the pale boy trailed off.</p><p>"How  could you two do anything. I mean you've only got one body between you, -ah I  see." Dan said.</p><p>"Well  no it's not like that," Gos said nervously.</p><p>"Quiet  you," Erika said.</p><p>"Why  must our friends be this way?" Sarah groaned to Ranma</p><p>"You're  asking me?" Ranma laughed, then added " I didn't know Allison swung that way."</p><p>"Look  she may have done some experimenting before we met, but,"</p><p>"Dan,  she dated that Langley girl for four months," Sarah said flatly.</p><p>"Ok  fine then.  She's bi.  So what?   This way I can be closer to her."</p><p>"Well  that makes sense." Gos said.</p><p>"Well  that's because your girlfriend is <i>in</i> your head," Sarah stated coolly.</p><p>"Our  head."</p><p>"Whatever."</p><p>"Look  Sarah you've known that Allison and I have been active for some time now.  So what that we've decided to mix it up now."</p><p>"I  suppose you're right, but it's like I can't know any guys who aren't girls  too."</p><p>Gos,  Ranma, and Dan looked at each other. Until Dan finally admitted, "Huh that <i>is</i>  odd."</p><p>"So  Dan any, problems with you curse? You know with water or anything else." Ranma  asked.</p><p>"Nope,"  Dan said after switching to his girl form</p><p>"So  once again  I get screwed.  Oh the upgrade works for you and Holo-boy not  for me."</p><p>"It's  not that bad.  All that failed to load  completely were the triggers. You've still got the clothing separation," Gos  said.</p><p>"So  what's the problem," Dan asked, pulling her hair out of her face. The only  thing about what Allison did that irked her.</p><p>"It's  a funny thing.  Instead of replacing the  old triggers the new ones simply merged with them in Boolean gates," Erika  said.</p><p>Dan  blinked. "I really need some coffee," she said walking out of the room.  The room fell silent until she returned with  the pot and a straw.</p><p>"You  do know that's been on all day," Sarah said.</p><p>"So,"  Dan said drinking the partially congealed beverage.</p><p>"As  I was saying, the upgrade didn't quite work in Ranma, I think it's because of  his template but I'm not sure.  Anyway  the result is that will or water will do it."</p><p>"Hey  Ran-Man didn't that old nut who taught you English say something about mental  control of the curse."</p><p>"Yes  Cologne said that Jusenkyou curses are affected by mental states.  A focused mind can control it blah, blah,  blah." Ranma said.</p><p>"And  then you got imprinted, and that went to hell," Sarah said next.</p><p>"Oh  crap" Erika muttered.</p><p>"That  could explain a few things," Gos said. "You should have told us about this  before we installed the upgraded curse."</p><p>"So  what happened now?" Ranma asked cynically.</p><p>"Essentially  a huge resource conflict. First there's the curse's original programs, then  there's the effect your will and ego have had on it, add in a template that we  can't edit, and finally mix in an upgrade package that'll try to override  everything else."</p><p>"Ouch,  that sucks," Dan said, draining the pot of the last of the liquid.  She then started using the straw to scoop out  the resin left on the bottom.</p><p>"So  all these things are bidding for the same patch of code," Ranma said.</p><p>"Yeah  it's a hierarchical nightmare," Gos said. "Well at least all that's being wonky  is the triggers. Hell the damn thing might even stabilize."</p><p>"So  how's it work now?" Dan asked.</p><p>"Well  to go girl, all I need to do is think it, but cold water will do it too, and to  go back I have to use hot water <i>and</i> will it to happen."</p><p>"That's  not any worse that before, cold'll still turn you  into a girl, and yah still need hot to get back."</p><p>"Yeah  but it's almost as if the curse wants me to be girl."</p><p>"Ranma  how many times have you been splashed at an really bad time," Gos said.</p><p>"Point  taken." Ranma then turned to Dan, "So what's Allison up to."</p><p>The  caffeine addicted, master mechanic, burnout smirked.</p><p>"Do  you really want to know?" Sarah interrupted before Dan could speak.</p><p>Ned  parked the fire engine red truck in front of Rebecca's house. The stenciling on  the doors of the large turbo diesel pickup illustrated that while it was Ned's  vehicle the ownership was not in his name.   On each of the doors was a large and stylized WIC with the words Winston  Industrial Container under them.</p><p>As  family businesses go Winston Industrial Container was one of the largest.  Headquartered in Cheyenne, a city in the  eastern part of  Wyoming  near the Colorado border, it is the main  supplier of construction and freight containers   in Wyoming, Utah,  and Montana,  and has considerable footholds in parts of Colorado, Nebraska, Idaho, and South  Dakota.  If one were to look chances are  that they would find one of their dumpsters at any construction site in the  Northern Rockies.</p><p>Winston  Industrial Container did more than lease industrial and construction  dumpsters.  They had also spread into  recycling taking the scrap metal and other debris that their clients filled  their containers with.  They sorted the  scrap and sold what the could, a surprisingly high percentage, and the rest was  trucked, using their fleet of heavy haulers, to vast storage depots, until a  profitable use was found for them.</p><p>Being  connected to such a business was the only reason that Ned had even considered  working with Golems.  He needed a  considerable supply of metals, ceramics,   and other compounds to carry out his experiments.  Having reached an understanding with his  great uncle Bob, a former resident of Lockridge and founder of Winston  Industrial Container, Ned was able to acquire all the scrap he needed, and use  company funds to purchase the necessary fabrication machinery.</p><p>Building  Golems whether they were mechs, areotech, or any other form of Calash enhanced  robotics was expensive and time consuming.   This was why Rebecca's Guymelef disturbed him so.</p><p>Despite  having access to considerable recourses there were still some parts Ned  couldn't get though the company.     Certain polymers and alloys that are traditionally not used in building  construction for example.  Somehow  Rebecca was able to acquire these materials.   Ned didn't know how she did it and until recently didn't care.</p><p>This  was how they reached their agreement Rebecca would give Ned the parts he sorely  lacked and in return  he would give her  schematics and an occasional bot.</p><p>Ned  was growing very concerned about Rebecca.   He didn't have all the information, but ever since Sarah O'Neil's twin  sister came back from Japan, Rebecca's been rather erratic.  Well that's not true ever since that fiasco with  the Terson girl, she'd been more distant, hell it  probably went as far back as when Rebecca's parents died.</p><p>But now... God attacking the school with a mech that she  supposedly built in one night (Ned remembered that Voltron comment).  He knew she was insanely good, almost  god-like, but at hacking into systems, not building Golems.  Ned doubted that even he could do it in one  night.  He could do it in two, after all  it was a relatively small mech.</p><p>Ned was here to cancel their deal, granted it was a little  like closing the barn door after the cows got out, but he wanted to get some  distance between himself and Rebecca.  A  storm was brewing.</p><p>After turning the truck around, he got out, and started  walking toward the front door, dressed in his now standard May Payne gear.  He'd gotten the idea off of that Arzish  fellow, dress exactly the same as your template so no one will know if you're  active.</p><p>Once at the door he opened it without knocking.  That he'd gotten this far was evidence that  Rebecca knew fully of his presence.  He'd  consulted her during one of her security upgrades and knew just how intense  they were.</p><p>Stepping  into the house Ned was reminded of the game he based his template on.  As usual the foyer was almost empty except  for some hideous metal sculpture that looked like it was fished out of one of  his family's dumpsters.</p><p>He  turned left into what probably was a dining room.  All that was in this one was a hideous lamp  in the shape of a fish sitting on the floor, giving off a feeble light.  The house was silent..  He could almost hear background music.  From the foyer one could only go into the dining  room (Ned had tried, all the other doors were locked) and from that room there  was one door that lead to the rest of the house.</p><p>Ned  walked up to it, his hand going to the knob.   Part of him was ready to jump through the opening, guns firing. He  turned it, and was rewarded with another darkened room about the same size as  the last. "God what's she left this time," Ned groaned walking up to the objects  in the center off the room. Under the dim light of yet another fish lamp, he  found four DVDs surrounding one book.   Ned was familiar with all the titles The Matrix, eXistenZ, Fight Club,  Dark City, and Desperation.</p><p>"Now  what does this mean?" he asked, mostly to himself.  Every time he came here Rebecca would leave  little presents on one of these rooms and then ask him questions about them. At  first Ned was baffled, as this seemed unusual for someone so collected and cool  as Rebecca to be playing these games, but after a few visits he realized that  to her these were experiments, like running a rat through a maze or paying a  college student twenty bucks to fill out a survey on binge drinking or drug  abuse.  And in that light this game made  prefect sense.</p><p>He  looked at the next door, across the room from the last one.  It was the last of the three puzzle rooms.  Ned waited pondering what the first two meant.   The first one was completely empty, early on Rebecca explained that the  fish lamps didn't count and would always be there.  The next had those movies and that book.  Could it be the perception of reality? Each of the movies dealt with the  question of what is real. But what about the book it was in the center.  That was just a story about a demon in Nevada  that could possess people. With that thought the fragments clicked.</p><p>In  the Matrix Neo went from being Tomas Anderson to the one. In eXistenZ a game  programmer  and a technician fleeing from  terrorist ended up being the ones who killed the "real" game programmers. In  Fight Club the main character learned the truth about Tyler Durden.  In Dark City a simple man  discovered that his memories and past were  manufactured.</p><p>Yes  all five dealt with the Vorlon's favorite question:  Who are you?</p><p>"Now  was the  first room or the last one the  answer?" Ned thought as he opened the next door.</p><p>"Hello  Winston," Rebecca said when the door was open.</p><p>Ned  stepped back, every other time Rebecca had waited behind the final door that  was off to the left and went into the kitchen.</p><p>"Sorry,  but I have a friend who just got in from Canada staying tonight that needs the  room."</p><p>"Right,"  Ned said as he followed her to the kitchen. Regardless he examined the room  closely, noting that  there was a glowing  fish lamp between a rather large backpack and a bedroll</p><p>Sitting  down at the kitchen table Rebecca asked her question, "So what do you want for  your next shipment?"</p><p>Taking  the seat next to her, Ned looked at the girl evenly.  He had to tread carefully now. "I'm thinking  of pulling out."</p><p>"Really,  are you aware of the repercussions?" she asked with a face that a diplomat, or  a card shark, would admire.</p><p>"No,"  he replied honestly with a poker face of his own. "But neither are you. The law  of unintended consequences applies to us all."</p><p>"I  see.  Might I ask why you wish to  withdraw?"</p><p>Ned  was prepared. "I believe that neither of us need this agreement anymore. As  recent events have shown, we are both quite capable on our own."</p><p>"I  know such things to be true on my end, and that you have secured a supply of  the parts you so desperately lack.  Given  your experience in the salvage industry, I have no doubts that you can make  this supply last, but it is still finite."</p><p>Ned  ignored the insult. She was angry and afraid.   But oddly not angry that her mech had been defeated, but that it had  fallen into his hands. Why? Not because he had got supply of parts.  Ned could have used other sources Rebecca was  just the easiest. Then why? Perhaps it was what he could learn from the  remains.  Yes there was the fear.  She was afraid that he'd figure out how she  did it.</p><p>He  prepared his response, "Ah but you see I have other contacts that I can use to  cover my loss.  However you lack the  tools to machine what I offer to the equation."</p><p>"Recent  events prove contrary to you last statement."</p><p>"Indeed  they do.  Remember that I also provide  design schematics which you would no longer have access to."  Knowing full well Rebecca's abilities Ned  kept all his "working" files on a computer that had never been networked to anything  and was stored in a secure location.</p><p>"I  can deal without them," she said a little too sharply</p><p>"Good,  we are in agreement then."</p><p>"It  would seem that way."</p><p>"I  will be leaving then," Ned said getting up. She'd taken this better than he'd  hoped.</p><p>"You  aware that without this agreement, you will have lost the intangible benefits  that came along with it." Rebecca said still maintaining her cool. Damn this  righteous prick.  She could manage  without his designs, but it would have been easier if he'd have stayed on.</p><p>"That's  the problem with intangibles you never know when you've got them," Ned said  allowing a slight smirk.</p><p>"It  is your loss," she said letting a little bit of her rage slip out.  The insolence. God how she wanted to kill him  right now.</p><p>"So  where is this friend of yours?" Ned asked changing the subject.</p><p>"Out,"  she replied curtly, lying to him for the first time.</p><p>Ned  looked at his watch, "I must be going too.   It was a pleasure doing business with you."  He then turned and walked out of the house  the same way he'd came.</p><p>Rebecca  watching him depart.  Frozen between  sending her watchers to eliminate him and doing nothing.   In the end she let him drive off unhampered.   If the watchers failed then she'd have  someone as skilled and relentless as Max Payne with a dash of mecha thrown  in.  It was too great a risk. And besides  if she killed him she would never figure out why he canceled the deal.</p><p>That  was what irked her most of all, not what she lost with the cancellation of the  deal, but the reasons that it had happened. She was supposed to be able to  predict him, to lead him, to control him.   That was why she set up all those stupid riddles.</p><p>The  law of unintended consequences.  Why was  she afraid of that?</p><p>As  Ned drove back to the compound  he noted  to increase security at home and the shop.   He also pondered the three rooms. Rebecca made it seem that the third  one wasn't part of it, but there was the fish.   An empty room, a room that asked who and what you are, and a room that  has the possessions of a Canadian and Rebecca.</p><p>Ned  knew that Rebecca winged it and had never been contusive to planning or long  term strategy.   But things were building  up:  Unintended consequences, chaos  complexity, the butterfly effect.   Despite having only fragments Ned was able to see that the foundations  had already been laid, and that Rebecca was set on her path.  That no one knew where this path would lead,  even Rebecca, was  beyond horrifying,  beyond dangerous.  Ned remembered that  those movies and books had another link.   In each of them the world as we know it is fundamentally changed.</p><p>Ned was sure  that he had made the right choice.</p><p>End chapter</p><p>Thanks to my Pre-readers</p><p>S.
