</div>Unforseen Problems<br/>By<br/>Imortis<p>The first thing Ranma felt when she woke up was pain, the<br/>second thing she felt was the cold. She opened her eyes<br/>slowly and blinked realizing she was looking at somethings<br/>back, she wrinkled her nose looking at the greenish brown<br/>thing she was swaying against. She tilted her head up a bit<br/>and blinked looking confusedly at a graveyard. She looked<br/>about quickly and blinked in surprise seeing a guijin woman<br/>with blonde hair kicking the shit out of three of the demons<br/>she was being carried by. Ranma blinked idlly curious about<br/>how the girl can be doing so well against all of them. She<br/>nodded seeing her drop one of them and clinched her fist.<p>Ranma drew back her fist and slammed it hard into the things<br/>spin as she smashed her knee into its face. It bellowed in<br/>pain as it fell to the ground, Ranma groaning stood up<br/>slowly and moved away from the struggling thing. She looked<br/>about for a second before slamming her foot down on its<br/>neck, strangely pleased hearing it snap, then ran over to<br/>help the girl. Ranma smirked knocking the demon holding the<br/>girl off its feet with a snap kick to the back of the neck<br/>then launched herself at the last one as it stopped looking<br/>surprised at her attack. Ranma made him pay for being so<br/>open. After a second it was dead and Ranma was looking at the<br/>girl that had killed the one she downed ["thanks for the<br/>help, who are you?"]<p>Ranma blinked only comprehending a small portion of it "I do<br/>not understand you." she said finally then winced falling to<br/>her knees touching her belly then paled as what she was<br/>touching came into focus. She looked from her swollen belly<br/>to the girl blinking at her before fainting. The girl<br/>blinked at the japanese girl before her, the stunned and<br/>horrified look still on her face. "Buffy!" a voice rang out<br/>to her and she raised her hand "over here Giles!" she called<br/>checking the girls pulse and blinked backing away. When the<br/>man that had called got over to her he was puffing<br/>softly "the demon I was trying to stop is dead back there,<br/>someone got to him first." he said. She nodded pointing and<br/>he quickly nelt by her. "Isn't this the sacrifice we<br/>saved?" he asked. She nodded "she woke up and gave me<br/>a hand." she said simply. He blinked "a vampire?"<br/>Ranma woke up hissing in pain as she clutched at her belly,<br/>writhing slightly at the way it hurt. "Just hold still, it'll<br/>be alright." a voice said in japanese beside her. She looked<br/>up and blinked at the man before her "what... what has<br/>happened to me?" she gasped. He patted her hand soothingly<br/>"we are not sure, what can you remember?" he asked. Ranma<br/>blinked at him for a moment trying to dredge her memory<br/>"there was this demon, we were hunting it." she started and<br/>gritted her teeth not so gently exsploring the bulge that<br/>was taking up almost half of her body. "You hunt demons?" he<br/>asked curiously. Ranma blinked at him nodding "of course, it<br/>is our duty to protect the innocent." She blinked in shock<br/>feeling something that definitely did not belong to the<br/>anatomy of a normal child. She looked at her belly in horror<br/>"this thing isn't human..." she breathed in terror. The man<br/>took her hand soothingly "don't worry, as soon as we can<br/>find out what it is we shall try to find out how to remove<br/>it."<p>She blinked up at him then looked around at the room she<br/>was in at the people sitting about reading from books, the<br/>blond one from the other night sitting with a man that was<br/>in no way alive. Ranma blinked at them for a moment "where<br/>am i?" she asked the polite man. He squeezed her hand gently<br/>"well, your at my house. We brought you here after you<br/>fainted. Can you tell us what kind of demon it was?" he<br/>asked. Ranma blinked at him then shook her head "we were<br/>tricked. We tracked the demon into a cave and ran into<br/>almost twenty of them, the letch had done it to punish me,<br/>and pop... I'll kill them."<p>He blinked at her for a second then blinked as the blond<br/>came over ["here, this is the type of demon we were<br/>fighting, ask her if its the one that grabbed her."] she said<br/>to giles. He blinked taking the book ["how do you know she<br/>was grabbed?"] he asked curiously. She shrugged ["they're<br/>always grabbed."] He blinked at that for a minute then<br/>showed Ranma the book "is this the demons you were hunting?"<br/>he asked. Ranma took it and shook her head "no, these are the<br/>ones the girl was fighting." she blinked and sat up sharply<br/>when the dead man came over. "Is this the demon?" he asked<br/>kindly. Ranma looked from him to the book and narrowed her<br/>eyes at the picture "yes." she looked pissed at the picture.<br/>He nodded "what happened?" he asked sitting down. Ranma spat<br/>to the side "happosai said that either I give myself to the<br/>demons and the rest live or we fight them and die. That<br/>bastard ryouga clubbed me in the head and shoved me at<br/>them."<p>He blinked "one of your friends gave you to the demons." he<br/>said blinking. Ranma shook her head "not my friend, dead<br/>meat when I get rid of this and get my body back. Oh, just<br/>you wait you honorless bastard. Your gonna get that man to<br/>man fight you want to the hilt!" Everyone in the room<br/>blinked looking up at the vicious sound to her voice ["what<br/>pissed her off?"] one of the two boys there asked. The dead<br/>one looked up a them ["she says she was hunting one demon<br/>and was sucker punched by someone who she was with when<br/>they found out that there was a lot more of them, he gave<br/>her to them. The rest i don't understand."]<p>They looked back at Ranma "what do you mean get your body<br/>back?" the older man asked curiously. Ranma blinked at him<br/>"you don't think I was born this way? I was born a man, I<br/>was cursed to look like this." she said bitterly. The dead<br/>man winced "someone cursed you to change into a girl." he<br/>said. She nodded glaring at the wall. ["whats she saying?"]<br/>Buffy asked. He looked up ["she says she is under a curse<br/>that turned her into a girl, she was born male."] They<br/>blinked at that for a minute before jumping when the girls<br/>hand darted forward and snatched the knife he had on his hip<br/>and shocked them when she sank it into the spot she had been<br/>fingering for a while. she hissed at them and smashed it in<br/>deeper. Ranma screamed in pain as something else screamed with<br/>her. She wrenched the blade side ways cutting off the<br/>scream. Ranma panted at them for a few minutes before<br/>wrenching the blade to the side slitting her stomach open<br/>before passing out. ["She must be nuts!"] one gasped as the<br/>dead one and Giles lifted her up onto the table and gently<br/>started checking her ["no, not nuts, she seems to have done<br/>just the right thing."] he said looking at the book he had<br/>["you pierce the demons temple with a blade then quickly<br/>remove it."] he said quickly helping the man pull the demon<br/>from the hole she had cut in herself. He nodded tossing it<br/>aside as it burst into flames ["help me clean out the<br/>remains, we need to get her to a hospital."]<br/>Ranmas eyes fluttered open slowly and hissed at the bright<br/>lights. She blinked through narrow eyes at the man standing<br/>over her looking kind ["how are you child?"] he asked<br/>gently. Ranma blinked at him and shook her head not<br/>understanding him. "Its ok dear, your at the hospital." Giles<br/>said coming over to her. She nodded calming down and layed<br/>back into the bed. She looked at him and blinked "why does<br/>the light hurt my eyes?" she asked. He started to answer her<br/>when one of the nurses pulled the curtain open and Ranma<br/>screamed darting across the room looking at the smoke rising<br/>from her arm. She raised it and looked shocked as the burn<br/>mark on it started to disappear. She looked at the beam of<br/>sunlight that had hit her and sat down hard "what has<br/>happened to me?" she asked in a daze.<p>After hurriedly shutting the blinds and shooing the shocked<br/>nurse from the room Giles came back over. "You do not know?"<br/>the dead one said helping her up, The rest of their group<br/>had rushed in when she had screamed. She looked at him "no.<br/>What has been done to me that the sun burns?" He looked<br/>surprised "haven't you been hungry since you woke up?" he<br/>asked. She shook her head "not really." she said feeling her<br/>stomach then pulled up her shirt to look at the faint scar<br/>where the stitches were still in her "can someone please<br/>take these out?" They looked shocked ["how the hell can it<br/>be healed after only nine hours?"] Buffy exclaimed. Giles<br/>shook his head guiding her back to the bed ["the burn mark<br/>on her arm is gone. Vampires wear the suns mark for the rest<br/>of their lives."]<p>After a doctor had been brought in tO remove the stitches<br/>and then quickly run off, Giles sat back down by her "let me<br/>introduce our group here." he said softly and pointed to<br/>the blond "this is Buffy, she saved you." Ranma nodded to<br/>her then looked at the dead one "what are you? Your body<br/>moves and yet you do not feel like you are alive. I can't<br/>feel you the way I feel the rest of these people." he<br/>blinked "you can tell?" he asked. She nodded "thats Angel,<br/>he, like you, is a vampire. One of the undead." he<br/>explained. Ranma blinked thinking about it for a moment "if<br/>that is so then why am I not in need of blood? The vampires<br/>I know of are constently in need of it."<p>He blinked at that for a minute "we don't know child.<br/>Anyways, this is Willow, Zander and Oz. we..." he tried to<br/>find some way of explaining it. "We make it our business to<br/>hunt evil." Angel said to her. She nodded looking at him<br/>"then it must be a struggle for you." she murmured. He shook<br/>his head "no, I was cursed some time ago with a soul so its<br/>not that hard." She nodded thinking about it "then it is not<br/>your true wish to aid in this." He shook his head "it is, I<br/>hate what I am." She nodded "and yet if it wasn't for this<br/>curse you would not be here."<p>He frowned at her "is it normal for you to upset those that<br/>wish to help you?" he asked shortly. Ranma nodded "I<br/>apologize. How do I get out of here if the light burns<br/>me?" she asked. They blinked "you would have to go with<br/>Angel until night fall." Giles said. Ranma winced "I deeply<br/>apologize then." She sat up and blinked at them "is there a<br/>shower around here?"<p>Ranma blinked quickly turning on the hot water and got under<br/>it. He beamed happily as he felt the stretching feeling<br/>that came with the change and thanked god as he looked in<br/>the mirror, blinking in shock at the changes. He was almost<br/>five inches taller then he used to be, and he had hair on<br/>his face. He looked up as the door opened and blinked at<br/>Angel "I brought you some..." He stopped seeing him "wheres<br/>the girl?" he demanded coming over. Ranma blinked turning<br/>off the hot water and sprayed himself silently. Angel and<br/>the rest of them gapped as she changed before their eyes and<br/>covered herself "I see you did not understand when I said I<br/>was cursed." she murmured softly. Giles blinked at her "its<br/>water based?" he asked. Ranma nodded "hot water returns my<br/>body to me, cold water puts me in this one."<p>He nodded clearing his throat "we shall let you get<br/>dressed." he said pulling the shocked teens out of the room<br/>as Angel put the clothes down "sorry about that." he said<br/>embarressed. Ranma nodded shutting the door before changing<br/>back. He looked at himself in the mirror again and shook his<br/>head in bemusement. When she came out they were blinking at<br/>her "why... didn't you change into your true form?" Giles<br/>asked. Ranma arched an eye brow showing him the dress she<br/>was wearing "I am constrained to obey the gender rules when<br/>it comes to clothing." She blinked at the look the blond was<br/>shooting him and glared back ["hes a perv?"] she asked Giles<br/>wrinkling her nose. He shook his head ["he said that he had<br/>no choice since all we brought him as clothes is a dress."]<br/>She blinked then nodded losing the look ["must be hard."]<br/>zander said musingly. Giles nodded ["yes, he must have a<br/>hard time keeping friends with this curse."]<br/>Ranma blinked looking about the tunnels Angel was leading<br/>her through and hummed softly "do these tunnels go<br/>everywhere?" she asked. He nodded "all over sunny dale." he<br/>agreed. Ranma snorted "must be a regular all you can eat for<br/>vampires." she said smirking. He nodded "thats why the<br/>slayer is here." he agreed. Ranma blinked "what is a<br/>slayer?" she asked. He shrugged "Buffy. She is the chosen<br/>one, gifted with the strength and agility to combat evil."<br/>Ranma blinked thinking about that "she has that." she<br/>murmured "but her skill is something she needs to work on."<br/>He blinked looking back at her "how do you mean?" he asked.<br/>Ranma looked at him dumbly "I killed two of those demons and<br/>I was like I was, I had to help her when they grabbed her.<br/>Not well trained." He blinked frowning "and your saying your<br/>better?" he asked. Ranma smirked looking back at him instead<br/>of the interesting markings on the walls "of course, she<br/>wouldn't even be a challange." she agreed. He frowned "your a<br/>very rude person you know that?" he asked. She nodded "I<br/>know, but I can't help it, my father took me from my mother<br/>when I was four, hes about as conciderate as a brick wall at<br/>a hundred miles an hour, you try learning to be nice with<br/>that sort of person riding your ass."<p>He snorted "I myself had an abusive father." he comented.<br/>She snorted looking at him amused "when I was six my father<br/>tossed me in a pit of starving cats after rubbing me down<br/>with fish. He did that to me quite a few times over the next<br/>three years, can you beat that?" He shook his head looking<br/>stunned. She nodded. "Your life must be hard." he murmured.<br/>She snorted "my father is the one that cursed me." he<br/>nodded pointing at a door "we're here." He opened it<br/>and walked in. Ranma shut and locked tHE DOOR before continuing<br/>after him. "Ah, I see your here." Giles said smiling. Ranma<br/>nodded looking about the high ceilinged room he and Buffy<br/>were waiting for them in "I wish to study you for a while,<br/>if you don't mind." he said smiling. Ranma nodded "alright,<br/>if you will teach me english I shall allow you to test me."<p>He blinked then nodded "Buffy said that you were able to<br/>kill two of the demons that attacked you when you awoke,<br/>would you be willing to show us how strong you are?" he<br/>asked. Ranma blinked then nodded slowly "alright, but tell<br/>her I will not take this seriously." she warned. He nodded<br/>telling Buffy ["rather arrogent huh."] she said standing<br/>firm waiting. Ranma smiled dropping into her favorite stance<br/>and beckoned to her. She blinked then darted in striking out<br/>at her. Ranma smiled blocking all of her punches and kicks<br/>effortlessly before hitting her gently in the chest with a<br/>palm strike knocking her into the wall.<p>Ranma bowed to her "you are strong and fast, and against<br/>those that you can find in this place that is enough, but<br/>where I come from you would be dinner to the first<br/>moderately skilled monster you find." Giles blinked at that<br/>for a few minutes then nodded. "Would you fight me?" Angel<br/>asked frowning. Ranma bowed "you are stronger and faster, I<br/>won't be gentle." she said adopting a kenpo stance. "You<br/>study kempo?" Giles asked inpressed. ranma nodded "i hold the<br/>seventh level dan in kenpo." she said simply shocking him.<br/>"Seventh? That would make you a grand master!" he<br/>exclaimed. Ranma nodded "I hunt demons and monsters, there<br/>is no such thing as enough training in this business." she<br/>said and bounced at Angel, intecepted his strike and flung<br/>him across the room. He looked shocked at her as he jumped<br/>back up, because her foot was in his gut and two fingers<br/>aimed at his eyes "you are good, but you train as if you do<br/>not exspect to fight soon."<p>Giles nodded clearing his throat "would you be willing to<br/>train Buffy in exchange for room and board?" he asked. Ranma<br/>bowed "I would do it for nothing, but I thankyou for the<br/>offer." He nodded smiling "lets find out what you eat."<br/>Ranma looked into the school library and blinked around for a<br/>minute before smiling in relief "Giles-san!" he called as the<br/>principal came in after him. Principle Snider looked<br/>annoyed at the man before him ["can you speak to this dimwit<br/>for me?"] he demanded. Giles nodded walking over "good day to you<br/>Ranma-kun, I see you can indeed come out during the day."<br/>Ranma nodded "I followed your advice and tried to enrole<br/>here but this fool doesn't speak anything but english, and<br/>badly at that." he said looking put upon. He nodded ["what<br/>can I help you with sir?"] he asked curiously. He nodded<br/>["what does he want?"] he asked. Giles blinked at him then<br/>took the paper Ranma had smiling and handed it to him ["I<br/>believe he wishes to enrole sir. He moved into an apartment<br/>across from mine and we got to talking. He moved here from<br/>osaka japan and i'm tutoring him in english."]<p>He nodded looking over the form ["great, another punk that<br/>can't speak."] he grumped stalking away. Ranma snorted after<br/>him "that man is like the mouse that thinks he can control<br/>the lions because he is standing on top of a fallen log." he<br/>said and blinked looking about hearing someone laugh. Giles<br/>smiled "Ranma-kun, this is our Japanese langaugeinstructor." he<br/>informed him and he nodded bowing to the woman "good to meet<br/>you maam, my trip here was rather abrupt and I did not get a<br/>chance to learn much english." he said embarressed. She<br/>nodded smiling "thats alright Ranma-kun, may I ask what your<br/>last name is?" she asked. He bowed "my name is Saotome Ranma<br/>maam." She looked surprised "Saotome, as in the nobel house<br/>of Saotome?" she asked. Ranma shrugged "I would not know<br/>maam, my parents aren't the best at offering up information<br/>about anything. All I know about the family is that pop is<br/>pop and mom only visits, she lives somewhere in Jubban."<p>They blinked "you don't live with your mother?" she asked<br/>shocked. Ranma shook his head "father took me from mother<br/>when I was four to train in martial arts and has not as of<br/>yet allowed me the option of returning to her." She looked<br/>angry "what kind of man is this that he takes a son from his<br/>mother?" she demanded. Ranma shrugged "pop isn't a man by<br/>honorable standards, as long as I've known him he had been a<br/>thief and con artist. I pray mother might have been a little<br/>indescrete on the night of my conception but I'm resolved<br/>to the fact that chances are she didn't. They always said<br/>love was blind and it seemed to have blindsided mother."<p>She laughed along with giles at that "well you know, I<br/>could look for you, I'm quite familiar with the great houses<br/>of Japan, I can do some checking if you wish." Ranma bowed<br/>again "I would be grateful." She nodded smiling "what is<br/>your fathers name?" she asked. Ranma gave the info to her<br/>and she nodded leaving "if you will be around after school<br/>maybe Mr Giles and I can tutor you together." He nodded<br/>waving goodbye "nice lady." he said. Giles nodded blinking<br/>at the principle as he came back in and handed Ranma a few<br/>sheets of paper ["tell him he's late for his first class."]<p>Ranma blinked carefully reading the english writing on his<br/>paper then read the same thing on the door he was before and<br/>nodded opening it. He blinked in and looked relieved seeing<br/>the woman from before "ah, Jacobs-san, it seems I am late<br/>for your class." he said showing her the paper. She nodded<br/>smiling "thats alright Ranma-kun, take a seat and we'll<br/>continue." Ranma smiled nodding to the students around him<br/>and nodded sitting next to the girl from last night,<br/>Willow "hello, me take class so can talk you." she said<br/>cheerfully. Ranma smiled bowing ["Ranma... pleased you go<br/>trouble... for friendship."] he said slowly and she nodded<br/>patting his hand ["oh good! Willow you know Mr Saotome!<br/>That'll be easier, you two shall be paired for a while."]<br/>Ranma blinked looking up from the book he was being coached<br/>from by Willow, Giles and the teacher, making him slightly<br/>dizzy, when a scream came to them from the front of the<br/>school "who could that be?" Ms Jacobs asked as Giles<br/>jumped up and ran to the window "no one we wish to know." he<br/>said as Ranma and Willow came over "Mamono." Ranma grumped<br/>and Willow corrected him ["in english its demon."] Ranma<br/>nodded swinging the window open and smiled confidently at<br/>them when they tried to stop him "the slayer isn't in the<br/>area, what do you suggest?" he asked. They yelped when he<br/>disappeared over the side "its not that really, its the four<br/>story drop!" Giles protested. Ms Jacobs hummed in pleasure<br/>"he is a Saotome if he can be so confident about defeating<br/>those monsters."<p>Ranma smirked bouncing to the ground and walking out to<br/>meet the demons that were searching the windows of the<br/>school "looking for something?" he asked and they looked up<br/>at him. The demon in the lead roared in anger seeing him<br/>"you killed the chosen one!" he snarled charging him. Ranma<br/>smirked dropping back and hit him with a chop to the throat<br/>then a snap kick to the face before bouncing away then back<br/>to land a five point combo in anothers face crushing the<br/>bone. He smirked dodging anothers claws and put his foot<br/>through his skull and used his body to cresent kick another<br/>one away, snapping one of its horns off in the bargin. he<br/>blinked looking up as he saw Buffy staking the last one. He<br/>blinked at her then bowed smiling. "That was impressive."<br/>Giles said coming out to them. Ranma nodded "the school I<br/>trained in believed that nothing in the world was more<br/>deadly then the fist used properly." he held up his fist.<br/>Giles nodded smiling "would you give us a few pointers on<br/>training?" he asked motioning him to come inside.<p>When they got back into the library the two woman clapped<br/>softly "amazing Saotome-san, you DO honor to the<br/>Saotomes legacy." she said pleased. He blinked "legacy?" he<br/>and Giles said together. She nodded "legends state that the<br/>Saotome clan has kami blood flowing through their vains, all<br/>through the ages Saotomes found a way to be in history<br/>texts, be it man or woman. They made the best fighters in the<br/>world." Ranma nodded "so we are." Giles looked interested<br/>"its a family trait?" he asked. Ranma shrugged "all I know<br/>is that I've been strong since I was a small child, I<br/>survived and mastered some of the most hazardous martial<br/>forms japan tried to bury, just not good enough to hide them<br/>from my father." he scowled softly at that but let it go<br/>as Giles went about setting up the practice equipment for<br/>Buffy who was doing warm up excersizes.<p>Ranma blinked looking up from the coaching of the two girls<br/>and blinked watching her perform a move ["no, its wrong."]<br/>he said standing up. He walked over and frowned at her<br/>["no move wrist, keep hard as stone."] he instructed<br/>telegraphing the move the proper way. ["This is the way you<br/>taught it to me Giles."] she said annoyed. Giles blushed<br/>slightly clearing his throat ["that would explain why the<br/>punch isn't as... effective as when my sensei taught it to<br/>me."] he said looking down. Buffy looked shocked ["you've<br/>been teaching me defective attacks."]<p>Ranma shook his head waving a finger ["not defective,<br/>beginner move, used to strengthen and tone in use, make<br/>wrist strong so can be hard as rock. This punch from<br/>advanced school."] he explained showing it to her again<br/>["many forms students never see because master not think good<br/>enough, or mature enough to not use for evil. Is steps, you<br/>skill is mastering of beginning step. Now ready for<br/>journeymen step, is middle ground where speed and agility is<br/>learned. First step learn strength and defence. Second step<br/>is confuse and evation."] He flashed his hands through a<br/>dizzying pattern before his fist stopped in front of her<br/>face ["many forms mimic movements of animal as way to<br/>confuse opponent, if he no understand why you move hand to<br/>side, he will no be on guard when move hand in for<br/>kill."] Giles smiled "would you spar with Buffy?" he asked.<br/>Ranma nodded moving out into the practice floor and shook<br/>his head picking up a table and moved it on top of another<br/>table ["not enough room inside for real spar, but work well<br/>enough."]<p>Ranma nodded to Buffy and after she dropped into the half<br/>way karate and half way kick boxing stance she used he<br/>spread his arms wide in the classic stance for the crane "is<br/>that..?" Ms Jacobs started before Buffy launched herself at<br/>him and he swept in, dancing about her with such flowing<br/>movements and sweeping strokes that Buffy was confused at<br/>how he always seemed to block her blows. She stopped after a<br/>minute and yelped as Ranma swept her feet without looking<br/>like he was ["are beginner. Know nothing of advanced<br/>forms."] he said helping her up "thats a kung fu move<br/>Ranma." Giles said. Ranma nodded ["Sholin. Is favorite style<br/>for them. Is style created from watching tiger battle<br/>crane."]<p>Buffy blinked at that ["how can a crane fight a tiger?"]<br/>she protested. Ranma smiled sweeping her feet and pinned her<br/>to the floor with a fluid stroke of his arms ["tiger is power<br/>and strength, crane is agility and evation. Crane won battle<br/>with tiger because tiger think, strike in every movement.<br/>Tiger confused when movement just distraction. Crane snap<br/>at tigers face with beak while flairing wings out, tiger<br/>frustrated when attack not come from way he think. Tiger<br/>leave crane alone. From watching two battle, Sholin create<br/>style based on quick flow movements and sneeky strike<br/>that confuse and disorient opponent. Way to make opponent<br/>powerless before you. Is half dance, half dodge. Even<br/>best of fighters fall to crane, only those master of style<br/>know, do not believe eyes. Eyes lie when fight crane,<br/>must trust heart, mind, spirit. If only watch with eyes then<br/>Buffy soon be dead slayer."]<p>After he let her up he moved back into the crane stance<br/>["stop trusting eyes, trust senses, is what save life. You<br/>must feel the strike coming, feel blow before it reaches<br/>you and block!"]<br/>Ranma blinked looking up from the grate she was looking out<br/>as Angel walked into the tunnel with her "got splashed?" he<br/>asked. Ranma nodded grimacing "asshole punk threw a water<br/>balloon at me, for a minute I was afraid I wouldn't make it<br/>here in time." He nodded looking at the smoke rising from<br/>her shirt "then its a good thing I brought this." he said<br/>holding up a thermos. Ranma smiled gratefully at him "your<br/>an angel, Angel." she said taking it. He nodded looking down<br/>"I just wanted to thankyou for teaching buffy, she's had a<br/>few close calls and she needs the skill." he said softly.<br/>Ranma smiled squeezing his shoulder after pouring the water<br/>over his head "its my pleasure my friend, I would do it<br/>gladly if it was only for the fact that she was a slayer,<br/>but I am pleased to do it as a way to repay you and your<br/>friends for aiding me the way you did, thats why I want you<br/>and the rest of them to join buffy and I in training." He<br/>blinked in surprise at that as Ranma left the grate and looked<br/>thoughtful as he went on his way.<p>When Ranma came into the lunchroom everyone looked up when he<br/>snatched up the idiot that threw the water balloon and<br/>hissed in his face ["if get wet again, I cut two fingers<br/>off hand."] he said squeezing the fingers he meant. The boy<br/>yelped in fear and scrambled away from him as he dropped<br/>him. ["Being a little hard on him?"] Buffy asked when he sat<br/>down with them. He glared showing them the burn marks on his<br/>shirt ["not at all."] he said cheerfully as he dug into his<br/>lunch. "If headmaster-kun sees ranma threaten students he<br/>punish." Willow said softly. Ranma smiled ["I know, but he<br/>in office right now doing paperwork."] he explained. They<br/>blinked at him ["how do you know where he is?"] Zander asked<br/>curiously. Ranma smirked at him and touched his head ["is<br/>ancient art held secret for very long time, saw him through<br/>window."]<p>He chuckled at the dumb looks they gave him ["is joke."] he<br/>said shaking his head. Willow laughed at that ["its funny, i<br/>didn't know you used jokes."] Ranma smirked at her nodding<br/>["only strike when most effective."] he agreed chuckling.<br/>Before anyone could say a thing ms jacobs hurried into the<br/>room. She looked relieved when she saw Ranma "come, you must<br/>see this, its urgent!" she said worry coating her words.<br/>Ranma blinked standing up and followed her looking concerned<br/>at the others.<p>When they got into the library they blinked at Giles who<br/>was reading from a computer monitor, then started out loud<br/>when they entered "in nineteen sixty eight the saotome<br/>family was devistated when twelve members of the clan were<br/>brutally slaughtered in their home on this day, missing from<br/>the dead was the family's youngest daughter... Saotome<br/>Nodoka. eight years old the child was thought to have been<br/>taken as food for the demons, the rest of the clan searched<br/>for a long time for the demon clan that did this act but<br/>could find no trace of them." Ranma groaned pulling himself<br/>off the floor and hurried over.<p>He blinked dumbly at the picture of the small child on the<br/>screen before sitting down at another screen. "What are you<br/>doing?" Giles asked. Ranma growled "looking up Genma." he<br/>hissed. The teacher shook her head "it won't work Ranma,<br/>thats the only thing I could find on your mother, its like<br/>you don't exist in japan." she said softly. Ranma stopped<br/>typing and nodded pointing out one of the monks on the<br/>screen "I thought so." he snarled. "1970: it was found that a<br/>group of monks were aiding a half breed demon in his<br/>efforts to open a gate to his home dimension in hopes of<br/>bringing an army of his kind into the human world, it was<br/>five members of the Saotome family that brought this cult to<br/>its knees. Hhmm, heres a list of the Saotomes." Giles mused<br/>"Genmas on it." he added. Ranma shook his head "this monk<br/>here is the man I know of as Genma." he bit out touching a<br/>face. He blinked touching another one "mom...!" he looked<br/>closer his eyes going wide as he picked out two more faces<br/>"Mr Tendo...,!"<p>Ranma paced along behind the chair as Ms Jacobs typed "Tendo<br/>Nabiki, I have come across information concerning the Tendo<br/>and Saotome clan that you desperately need to know of, if my<br/>suspicions are correct, you and your sisters could be in<br/>danger, this concerns the fate of Saotome Ranma." She nodded<br/>finishing it off and mailed it "when should we expect a<br/>reply?" she asked. Ranma bit his lip "Nabiki works on her<br/>computer for a while before she goes to bed, hopefully she<br/>will return it soon." He looked up hearing a beeping sound<br/>and she blinked seeing the e-mail. She opened it and blinked<br/>at the japanese "interesting, this is my instant message<br/>address." she reported pulling up the program and typed it<br/>in "I thank you for the swift reply." she typed. "How did<br/>you know I would be online at this time?" her response said.<br/>Ms Jacobs smiled "i have a close friend that knows you, I have<br/>been researching the family lines of the houses of japan and<br/>came across something disturbing concerning the Saotome<br/>clan, we should talk." Ranma grinned at the response "whats<br/>your phone number?"<p>Ranma sighed picking up the phone receiver at the same time<br/>Ms Jacobs did "hello?" she asked. "Tendo Nabiki." the voice<br/>said, Ranma nodded to her "I thankyou for calling, my name<br/>is Sharion Jacobs, I live in sunnydale california, recently<br/>a friend of mine turned my interest to the Saotome line and<br/>I found something that is very wrong with what I know of the<br/>family." Ranma smirked hearing something in the background<br/>"whats that?" Nabiki asked. Ms Jacobs smiled "I found out that the<br/>man you know as Aaotome Genma is an imposter, his real name<br/>is Saroka Ikogu, he was a member of a sect of demon whorshipers<br/>that some think are responsible for the slaughter that<br/>killed twelve members of the Saotome family and abducted<br/>Saotome Nodoka from the home when she was eight, I found a<br/>picture of the members of the sect from twenty years ago,<br/>from what I can tell... both Saotomes you know of as well as<br/>your mother and father were a part of this sect. My friend<br/>identified Tendo Soun and Tendo Kimiko easily from the<br/>picture as well as the Saotomes." The line was silent for a<br/>few minutes "I want to see this picture." she said cooly<br/>"who is your friend?" she added, Ranma heard a voice in the<br/>background "ask her about Ranma!"<p>Nabiki cleared her throat "what did you mean about Saotome<br/>Ranma?" she asked. Sharion sighed "it is a sketchy report I<br/>have, but its not good, someone witnessed Saotome Genma and<br/>Hibiki Ryouga betray and capture Saotome Ranma while they<br/>were hunting a demon three months ago, from what we can tell,<br/>the two gave Ranma to the group of demons that they met<br/>forty miles to the south of tokyo, from the pictures I can<br/>find the Hibikis are also a part of this sect your parents<br/>belonged to. After a little searching I found out that the<br/>sect was trying to open a portal to the home of a half demon<br/>named Happosai, so that he could gather an army on the human<br/>realm to take it over, the Saotome clan has been guardians<br/>of japan against demons for the longest time, I would not be<br/>surprised it the demon halfbreed was the one that first took<br/>Saotome Nodoka from her family."<p>"What do you suggest we do about this?" Nabiki asked softly.<br/>"Get out. If they would do this to Saotome Ranma then they<br/>would not hesetate to do the same to you, I suggest you come<br/>here, we have someone here that has been fighting demon<br/>clans for the last few years." Ms Jacobs said quietly.<br/>"How?" Nabiki asked. In the background Akane was ranting<br/>softly "I know of a cache of money and equipment that<br/>Saotome Ranma had hidden a while ago." she said. The ranting<br/>stopped and a new voice came on the line "how do you know<br/>so much about Ranma?" Akane demanded sharply. Ranma smiled<br/>softly "Tendo Akane I take it?" she asked. Akane snorted "I<br/>know of Ranma because I am... able to speak with the dead!"<br/>she said looking at Angel who had appeared when the sun went<br/>down "Ranmas... dead?" Akane asked her voice trimbling. Ms<br/>Jacobs bit her lip "I can't say, its not his ghost that told<br/>me of him, if your worried." she said softly. Akane exhaled<br/>shakily "he might be alive?" she asked softly. Ranma<br/>clinched his fist looking like he was in pain "yes, he is<br/>alive." she said softly "the money he hid is found under a<br/>floorboard in your room Akane, he hid the money under your<br/>bed thinking that if he needed to escape that place he would<br/>take you with him." Akane cried out softly at that and<br/>Nabiki came back on the line "where are you?" she asked.<br/>Sharion smiled softly "we'll meet you at the terminal,<br/>you'll recognize one of us."<p>After they hung up Ranma looked at the floor clinching his<br/>fist tight. "Are you alright Ranma?" Giles asked. Ranma<br/>looked up and blinked at the tears in his eyes "its alright,<br/>its just... I didn't think Akane returned my feelings." he<br/>said softly wiping his eyes. Sharon nodded rubbing his<br/>shoulder. ["So what now?"] Zander asked trying to lighten<br/>the mood. Ranma looked up at him ["we find out what I am."]<br/>Nabiki looked annoyed as hell as she pulled her reluctant<br/>sister along as she protested yet again about leaving before<br/>making breakfast. The two sisters stopped pulling their<br/>balky sibling along when they saw the group standing in<br/>front of them. Ranma pulled the hood of his cloak back and<br/>looked at them nerviously. The three rushed up to him as<br/>one "oh my! We should call your mother! She'll be so<br/>relieved your alive!" Kasumi said. "Why haven't you gotten in<br/>touch with us Ranma." Nabiki asked cooly, Akane smashed him<br/>into the ground with her mallet "you let me think you were<br/>dead you jerk!" she yelled at him angrily. He hissed<br/>looking back up at them as the cut on his forehead closed<br/>shocking them "I didn't because I'm sorta... not alive." he<br/>blinked when Akane grabbed his hand and felt his pulse "you<br/>look alive to me." she said. Ranma nodded "thats because I was<br/>killed in my cursed form."<p>Before he could say anything else Nabiki poured water over<br/>him. Ranma hissed horrendously scrambling out of the light<br/>smothering the flames that burst forth from her arm as the<br/>others hurried to help. She glared at her angrily as Giles<br/>poured hot water over his head. Ranma stomped back over to<br/>them "don't ever do that again." he said dangerously quiet.<br/>Akane grabbed his burnt arm and watched the burn evaporate<br/>"what did they do to you?" she asked softly. Ranma sighed<br/>rubbing his eyes "if we can go someplace quiet?" he prompted<br/>nodding to the staring people. They nodded following the<br/>group.<p>By the time they reached Giles place the burn was gone and<br/>all three sisters were shocked "why are you here Ranma?"<br/>Nabiki asked. Ranma sighed "I'd rather not." he said softly.<br/>She stared at him for a few minutes. "I... woke up here a few<br/>weeks ago and met Buffy and Giles here... they... helped<br/>me do something and gave me a place to stay. Lately I've<br/>been training Buffy to help her with her demon hunting job."<br/>She nodded still looking at him "what aren't you telling<br/>us?" she demanded firmly. Ranma looked away from them not<br/>saying a thing ["so whats wrong with telling them you were a<br/>demon mommy?"] Zander asked from behind them. ["Do not speak<br/>of that!"] he snarled in english. Nabikis eyes widened<br/>sightly ["yes don't speak of it, they would proclaim him<br/>unclean because of it."] Giles said softly from behind him.<br/>Nabiki looked at the pain on Ranmas face for a moment ["I<br/>can understand you, you know."] she said softly to them.<br/>Giles blinked at her as the others shot Zander a dark look.<p>Ranma looked at his hands as she stared at him ["what<br/>happened to you Ranma?"] she asked softly. He didn't look up<br/>at her "I don't know alright? I woke up when Buffy here<br/>stopped what they were doing." he said softly not looking at<br/>any of them. Akane moved over to sit with him and took his<br/>hands "what happened?" she asked. He shook his head and they<br/>looked at Giles. He cleared his throat ajusting his glasses<br/>"well... we heard of a demon ritual that was taking place<br/>and being who we are we went to interrupt it." They blinked<br/>nodding. "Well, you see it was a ritual of sacrifice designed<br/>to instill the strength and power of the host in the... child<br/>that is born of it." They looked horrified "they... got<br/>ranma pregnant...?" Akane breathed. He shook his head "not<br/>the way you think, I aSsure you." he said quickly. They<br/>looked relieved. "The child is introduced into the womans<br/>womb with a spell. We interrupted the rite and Ranma woke up<br/>when they tried to escape with her... him." Ranma nodded not<br/>looking up "how... how did you..." Akane asked softly. Angel<br/>shrugged "he took a knife and gutted himself, killing the<br/>thing." he said simply. The three looked horrified at that<br/>and Ranma yelped protesting when Akane ripped his shirt open<br/>to look at the scar traveling along his belly "so... it<br/>didn't... hurt you?" she asked softly. Ranma shook his head<br/>"no its all gone. As far as we can tell, something about my<br/>curse helped me partially reject the vampires curse in me.<br/>I'm pretty much human in this form and only half vampire in<br/>the other one, I burn at the suns touch but I don't need<br/>blood. I'm a lot stronger then I was in both forms."<p>Nabiki nodded blinking at that for a few minutes "so what<br/>are we supposed to do here Ranma?" she asked. Ranma blinked<br/>then nodded "I have an apartment here, it has three rooms<br/>in it, I can take the couch. Its not safe to go back until<br/>we find out why they did this to me." They nodded "what<br/>else?" she said. Ranma shrugged "I don't know, I got a job<br/>and I'm enroled at the local high school. Ao what comes<br/>naturally." She nodded pursing her lips "you work." she said<br/>blinking. He nodded smirking "I opened a dojo in the<br/>comercal district, these people will pay anything you ask<br/>to learn this stuff, after an hour of watching Buffy<br/>and I sparring, we had fifty students paying two hundred<br/>dollars a peice for five lessons."<p>Nabiki and Akane looked shocked "your kidding?" they said<br/>together. He shook his head "I paid my rent for the next<br/>four months." Kasumi smiled "I'm glad your doing so well<br/>Ranma, but what am I to do?" she asked worried. Ranma<br/>blinked at that "well, we could um... Mr Giles could use a<br/>maid." he said looking at Giles. He blinked "not really..."<br/>He stopped when Kasumi smiled "oh my, your right Ranma." she<br/>said looking about. Ranma winked at Giles ["Kasumis very<br/>good at what she does."]<br/>By the time they had gotten to the building Ranma had rented<br/>for the dojo the cafe across the street was full and the<br/>students were waiting excitedly for them. Ranma smiled at<br/>them as they arrived ["hello students, would like you to<br/>meet my assistant sensei, Tendo Akane."] he said waving to<br/>Akane, she smiled pleased as she bowed "hello." she said and<br/>followed Ranma into the building. Akane blinked in surprise<br/>looking around at the set up, on one side he had padded mats<br/>lining the walls and punching bags of all sizes as well as a<br/>balance beam "how can you have gotten all this if you only<br/>started a few weeks ago?" Nabiki asked. He smiled waving the<br/>students over to the mats "Giles gave them to me, we made a<br/>deal, I would continue to train Buffy if she works as an<br/>assistant sensei on the weekends and acts as window dressing<br/>during the weekdays while training with me." he said<br/>smirking as he went into the back. When he came out he was<br/>wearing a black silk gi trimmed in red. He smiled handing<br/>akane one "here, its the one I use in the night classes,<br/>it'll fit you." She nodded going in the back ["today we have<br/>a treat students, my fiancee and fellow sensei Tendo Akane<br/>has arrived from our home and has agreed to teach with us<br/>here. Today Akane will be showing you the basics in self<br/>defence for women, Akane is an expert in handling male<br/>attackers and is a good sensei. You men I want over here,<br/>you are to practice the kata I showed you yesterday until<br/>you feel you have perfected it." He bowed to them at the<br/>same time Akane did and the two groups split up.<p>Ranma smiled at Buffy when he got over to the part of the<br/>room where they normally sparred ["your in a good mood<br/>Ranma."] she comented throwing the first few punches at him.<br/>He grinned blocking all of them solidly before launching his<br/>counter attack, keeping it slow enough for her to dodge or<br/>block most of them. He grinned, she was able to evade the<br/>ones she had been hit with last time ["yes I am. I am doing<br/>what I have wanted to do for a long time, if things had<br/>worked out akane and I would have ran the dojo together."]<br/>he said smiling as he was forced to backflip away from her<br/>attack, grinning when he dodged away as he landed and sent<br/>her flying away from him with a palm strike to the chest. He<br/>chuckled helping her up ["very good. Now lets try it at a<br/>faster pace."]<p>After a few hours Ranma smiled coming over to Akane and<br/>watched interestedly as she coached the four groups of<br/>women in throwing moves and how to break holds. ["I see your<br/>students are progressing well akane-chan."] he said<br/>pleased. All the women there smiled pleased as Akane nodded<br/>["they were taught the beginnings well Sensei Ranma."] she said<br/>smiling at him. He smiled ["would you like help in demonstrating<br/>the moves?"] he asked. She nodded grinning ["are you offering<br/>Sensei?"] she asked. He nodded smiling ["of course, I shall be<br/>the attacker?"] he asked. She nodded smiling. The two groups<br/>of practicing teens and adults hurried over to the mats as<br/>the two walked over to the windows. Ranma raised his hand<br/>["in this I will acost Akane-chan like any normal man would<br/>and she will demonstrate that even though a woman is smaller<br/>then a man, that does not mean she is helpless against him."]<p>Ranma darted up at Akane and yelped in surprise when she<br/>grabbed his outstretched arm and flung him at the wall,<br/>making him grunt when she pinned him with an arm held<br/>tightly behind his back in seconds ["as... Akane-chan has<br/>shown, even though I had reach and surprise, you can gain<br/>the upper hand."] he said in a pained voice. Akane giggled<br/>letting him up and he stood up rubbing his shoulder. She<br/>smiled turning her back as he went across the room and<br/>picked up one of the wooden play knives he had and tossed<br/>it as he walked back over. He grinned ["in a case with a<br/>knife you must be careful."] he said walking up and grabbed<br/>Akanes arm and pressed the thing into her side. She raised<br/>her arms and grinned at them hooking her foot behind his as<br/>she twisted. Ranma grunted as the fake blade was slapped<br/>from his hand and he was pinned again. He looked at them for<br/>a minute "this is going to be a pain in my ass."<br/>Kasumi and Nabiki looked up and blinked when Akane walked<br/>into the house looking smugly pleased as Ranma followed her<br/>at a slower pace looking like he had been chewed up and spit<br/>out "your students mean?" Nabiki asked. He shook his head "I<br/>need to stop being so helpful." he said slumping into the<br/>couch. Akane grinned walking back in and smacked his ass<br/>making his jump "Ranma gave himself over to the womens<br/>defence class as a mock attacker, I think the girls were<br/>trying to be nice." she giggled. Ranma waved her off weakly.<br/>They looked up and blinked when a knocking came to the door.<br/>Akane smiled walking over and let Buffy in carrying a<br/>satchel "you look chewed up Ranma." she laughed. Ranma<br/>grumbled into the couch "are you coming with me?" she<br/>asked. He sat up and nodded "let me go change, I hurt too<br/>much in this body." he said walking into the kitchen. When<br/>she came out she grinned slipping the wakazashi she had into<br/>the sheath sawn upside down into her coat "you only got<br/>home." Kasumi protested. Ranma looked apologetic "sorry<br/>oneechan, but theres a lot of evil in this town and Buffy<br/>here gets overwelmed at times even with all the others<br/>helping." Akane blinked "can I come?" she asked. Ranma<br/>blinked then shrugged "hey, why not, its not like a blond, a<br/>red head and a brunet all walking out late at night isn't a<br/>tasty treat for the demons roaming the area." Buffy looked<br/>reluctant ["are you sure?"] she asked. He nodded ["Akanes almost<br/>as good as you are, she'll be joining us on our training<br/>matches on the weekends."]<p>Akane smiled taking Ranmas hand as they got a little ways<br/>from the apartment complex and smiled at the blushing girl.<br/>["So whats happening tonight?"] Zander asked holding up a<br/>crossbow. Buffy snorted ["these two want to neck."] she said.<br/>He grinned ["can I watch?"] he asked and Ranma elbowed him.<br/>Giles smiled at them when they reached the graveyard "we're<br/>looking for traces of the demons that brought Ranma here,<br/>they've been sighted in this area." he said cheerfully. He<br/>smiled when Akane joined him as they went looking into the<br/>cripts.<p>"So why do you bury your dead in this sort of place?" Akane<br/>asked Giles when he came out of the cript he was searching.<br/>He blinked "well, from what we can tell, the city was<br/>constructed under the idea that demons and vampires would be<br/>catered to here. We found out a while ago that the man that<br/>founded the town wanted it to be a haven for the demon<br/>races." Akane blinked in shock at that "why would anyone let<br/>him do that?" she asked. He shrugged "back then no one<br/>realized what he planned, so far his plans are still on<br/>track but we're doing what we can to spoil them." She<br/>blinked at him "Ranma thought we were safer here then back<br/>home?" she asked. He shrugged opening another door and<br/>shouted falling back from the green skinned thing that<br/>jumped out at him. Akane shouted lunging forward and knocked<br/>it off its feet before grabbing Giles "we need the others."<br/>he murmured seeing the ten others that appeared from the<br/>cript.<p>Both of them blinked looking up after running out into the<br/>open when a large group of men appeared standing in their<br/>way. ["Well well well, if it in't Buffy's owner, the watcher."]<br/>a blond man said smirking slightly. ["Whos the new pet? Shes a<br/>cute one."] he added before blinking at the demons as they<br/>burst through the trees coming after them. ["Back off vampire<br/>scum! These are ours!"] one of them roared pointing a fist<br/>at them. Spike looked around before looking at the demons ["I<br/>don't see your name on them."] he sneered walking forward,<br/>the vampires followed a little nerviously. "The girl is our<br/>property scum, she has been ours since she was born." the<br/>demon spat again, this time in japanese. Spike cocked his<br/>head to the side "is that so? Looks to me like she don't<br/>know what your talking about mate."<p>He opened his mouth to speak again when one of them roared<br/>in pain as Ranma burst from over top of them on a tail of<br/>blood. She whirled around as she landed and splattered<br/>another ones head as he ran at her an gutted another from<br/>crotch to chin with her sword before she landed. In five<br/>seconds ten demons had become the one Ranma was holding off the<br/>ground "start talking or I show you some of the things my<br/>father showed me when I was a child, do you think you'll<br/>swallow your tongue or go insane first?" She let up the<br/>tight hold she had on his throat and forced him to his<br/>knees. "Y- You killed the child..." he gasped in shock Ranma<br/>handed her sword to Giles and snapped the things horn off<br/>"talk monster, why did you put that thing in me?"<br/>It trimbled a little in fear as it cupped its hand over the<br/>bleeding hole in its head "you... you were born to serve<br/>us!" he pleaded. Ranma grabbed the other horn and he cried<br/>out. "Your parents birthed you to be the mothers of our<br/>champions!" he shouted holding up his hands. Ranma clinched<br/>her fist and the horn broke "explain!" He whimpered "you...<br/>your of the Saotome house! one of the few houses of the<br/>chosen! Everyone wants a Saotome female for their rites<br/>because they bring greater results, its because of the blood<br/>of the greatest neutral god ever known flowing through your<br/>veins! Your the most ideal sacrifice for demons and humans<br/>for good and evil purposes!"<p>Ranma clinched her fist and cocked it back "and? Continue!"<br/>she barked. He nodded "b- but its so hard to catch one of<br/>them! The reason their so sought after is also why their such<br/>powerful hunters! It was next to impossible to catch a<br/>female alive and in descent condition. So... they took a<br/>child... She's produced five daughters for the highest<br/>bidder." Ranma gapped in shock and horror almost let him go.<br/>She backed away letting him go "and me?" she asked softly. He<br/>rubbed at his throat "you were born male, your father assured<br/>us he would fix that." he coughed standing up. Ranma looked<br/>up at him "and the Tendo girls? You said she was yours." He<br/>nodded looking at her "the tendo daughters were sold to us<br/>at an early age, they can't compete with a Saotome but they<br/>hold enough power to perform their role well. We've had no<br/>use for the current three because we waited for that fool to<br/>make good on his claim and give us a virgin Saotome female."<p>Ranma looked up at him "current three?" she asked. He nodded<br/>blinking "there were five of them. This one had a twin, its<br/>how I recognized her." They stood there for a minute just<br/>blinking in stunned horror before Ranmas hand flashed<br/>forward and ripped his throat out. She let her bloody hand<br/>drop to her side and looked at the ground for a few minutes<br/>before looking up hearing the vampires still stnading there<br/>move. "Well, a bloody find we have here." spike murmured<br/>"Don't even bother Spike." Buffy said appearing with angel.<br/>She smirked at him "Ranma would rip all of you to pieces in<br/>seconds." she snorted. Spike looked at her "the slayer, why<br/>is it you always show up when I want to have fun?" She<br/>smirked "I guess I'm lucky, but seriously Spike." She walked<br/>over "don't mess with this girl, she's kicked both our asses<br/>in under a minute." Angel nodded when they looked at him<br/>"she makes my febble skills look pathetic." he agreed. Spike<br/>snorted "I'll believe that when I see it." he sneered. He<br/>smacked one of the men behind him "kill the red head." The<br/>vampire blinked at him for a second before shaking his head<br/>backing away "no way man, she killed ten of those things in<br/>seconds, that one was scared to death, you heard! Shes a<br/>fucking godling half breed."<p>Spike glared turning on him "ya fucking wanker..!" he started<br/>when something grabbed him from behind and he found himself<br/>on his knees staring at Ranmas green blood covered hand<br/>opened to him "a vampire is a laugh where I came from, their<br/>play things compared to the kinds of demons we have." she<br/>said softly closing her hand. She let him go and he<br/>scrambled away from her "so? I bet we could take you if we<br/>attack at once!" he declaired glaring. He blinked looking<br/>behind him and realized his men were gone. He spat before<br/>looking back at them "don't think this is over ya chit." he<br/>growled before bolting himself. Ranma snorted looking at her<br/>hand for a minute. She blinked looking up when Akane hugged<br/>her gently. Akane looked at the despair and hopeless darkness<br/>in her eyes and held her tighter. "Well, we didn't expect<br/>that sort of thing did we?" Giles said trying to lighten the<br/>air. Ranma looked at them "I'm heading back guys, I'm tired<br/>all of a sudden." she said sounding very old. Akane<br/>held onto her ["we'll see you later."] she murmured leading<br/>Ranma away. Buffy nodded waving ["don't take it so bad,<br/>demons rarely ever have anything good to say."]<p>Ranma looked at her ["truth comes from you painfully at times<br/>Buffy. later."] They blinked at her for a minute before<br/>looking to Giles. he looked sad ["they found out that...<br/>everything they believe in is a lie."] They blinked after<br/>them in worry.<br/>Ranma looked up from the floor as he walked out of the<br/>kitchen, idlly chewing on an apple when he saw Nabiki in the<br/>door way "how are you doing Ranma?" she asked softly. He<br/>looked at her dully "I found out I've had five sisters and<br/>that all of them were sold as sacrifices Nabiki, how do I<br/>feel? I don't know. I always hoped I had a brother or a<br/>sister and pop was lying to me like everything else...<br/>but... Hows Akane taking it? She had a twin!" he looked<br/>dazed leaning against the wall. She looked down "Akanes...<br/>shes in shock like the rest of us, we had two other<br/>sisters." she shook her head. Ranma nodded "I guess... I<br/>feel numb, my whole life was about being the best at the<br/>school I was born into... to find out thats nothing, it was<br/>all nothing, all I was... was a peice of cattle, being<br/>groomed for slaughter. I feel like i'm going to go insane if<br/>I don't stop thinking about it."<p>He looked up and offered his arms to Akane when she walked<br/>into the hall. She gratefully excepted his embrace, burying<br/>her head in his shoulder. He sighed putting his head on her<br/>shoulder. "It doesn't matter Ranma, nothing they wanted<br/>matters, what we want is what we will do, we can make it<br/>real, we can stay here and the school will be real<br/>because you already own a dojo." she murmured softly. He<br/>nodded looking at the ceiling for a minute. He sighed<br/>looking into the living room when the doorbell rang "I'll<br/>get it." a subdued Kasumi said from behind them in the<br/>kitchen "oh! hello Ms Tendo." Giles said coming into the<br/>living room with Buffy and the rest of them, minus Angel, it<br/>was afternoon "are you doing alright Ranma? Akane?" he asked<br/>softly looking at them concerned. Both nodded looking up at<br/>them "I guess sensei." Akane murmured. Ranma shrugged "I<br/>knew my father was scum, I just didn't know how much I owed<br/>him for." He nodded holding out a sheet of paper "Ms Jacobs<br/>gave us this in class today. We were concerned when you<br/>didn't come, any of you." he murmured looking at Nabiki<br/>as well ["today was a day none of us were ready to face,<br/>last night was a shock to say the least, Ranma only woke up<br/>an hour ago."<p>Kasumi nodded ["oh my yes, we were worried about him, we<br/>thought that his vampire side might have gotten stronger!"]<br/>she said warmly concerned. Ranma snorted "lets just say I<br/>got caught up on sleep I needed, I was tired yesterday."<br/>Akane nodded looking at them from Ranmas chest. "yes, well,<br/>anyways, Ms Jacobs went ahead on the things she was told you<br/>of the other day and contacted the head of the Saotome<br/>clan." Ranma blinked looking up and took the paper from him.<br/>He blinked in shock "their sending someone here?" he asked<br/>softly. He nodded "thats why I came here right after school,<br/>she should be meeting them right now."<p>Nabiki blinked "your saying the family Ranmas mother was<br/>stolen from is coming here?" she asked feeling a little<br/>paniced herself. He nodded "she told me she would bring them<br/>here... about now." he turned hearing a knock at the door<br/>right when he finished talking. Ranma watched the door as<br/>Kasumi hesetently opened in and eeped moving back in shock<br/>as it opened to reveal... Ranma... with gray hair. They<br/>blinked looking from the youthful faced Ranma standing in<br/>the door staring at Ranma to the boy they knew "yours him."<br/>he said softly as he came in the room, making them twitch<br/>when two younger hims walked in with him, followed by his<br/>curses double, all of them looked just different enough to<br/>not be doubles, but the relation was obvious "has Nodoka<br/>had many children?" he asked standing across the room from<br/>them. Buffy and her crew had moved to the side leaving ranma<br/>and the girls to stand by themselves. Ranma looked at them<br/>for a minute before letting go of Akane "it seems so." he<br/>said pushing off from the wall. He nodded for more. Ranma<br/>crossed his arms "from what I can tell I'm her sixth child."<br/>he said flatly. He blinked a little at that "why would she<br/>have so many?" he asked frowning. Ranma shook his head "your<br/>asking the wrong one about that, up until last night I<br/>thought I was an only child of cruel hearted parents." He<br/>blinked looking from him to the girls "who are these?" he<br/>asked. Ranma looked at them "these are the remaining Tendo<br/>sisters. There were five of them acording to our source."<p>He blinked at that "what do you mean?" Ranma looked down for<br/>a minute "I came here because my father and someone I<br/>thought was a friend betrayed me and gave me into the hands<br/>of a demon clan as a sacrifice. The slayer here stopped them<br/>and I escaped." He looked at them and nodded looking at<br/>Giles "watcher, we have delt with your caste before. What do<br/>you mean sacrifice? Males are almost worthless for sacrifice<br/>at your age." Ranma looked at him "so I've found out. A few<br/>years ago my... the man pretending to be Saotome Genma,<br/>took me to this place in china that changes anything that<br/>touches the water into the form of the thing that drown there<br/>in the past." He nodded crossing his arms "jusenkyo." he<br/>agreed. Ranma took the glass of water from Nabiki and poured<br/>it over his head. The two younger men backed up a bit<br/>hissing "they have a spring of undead girl there?" he asked<br/>stonily. Ranma shook her head "no, just plain old girl, this<br/>was done to me during the time since I was taken and I woke<br/>up a few weeks ago. The curse has allowed me to keep my<br/>humanity in my real body, thank god. He shoved me into the<br/>spring. Up until a month ago I thought nothing was wrong,<br/>at least nothing demonic."<p>He nodded seeing the pain that crossed his face for a split<br/>second "what is your source?" he asked. Ranma cleared his<br/>throat "we hunted down a pack of the demons that brought me<br/>here and I interrogated one after killing the rest. He told<br/>us that I had five sisters that I had no hope of ever<br/>meeting because the sole reason they were born was to be<br/>used as sacrifice for what ever demon clan paid our parents<br/>enough for their blood, my being born a male put a wrinkle<br/>in their plans." He nodded looking grimer then he was, if<br/>that was possible "so you trust the demons word?" he asked<br/>soflty. Ranma looked at him emotionlessly "he was too scared<br/>to lie to me. He knew he was going to die, and I heard it in<br/>his voice." He nodded looking at him speculatively "your<br/>saying that not only is our lost daughter being used to<br/>produce sacrifices, a man is walking around calling himself<br/>Saotome, and that he did this to you." he said leaning back.<br/>Ranma nodded "it wouldn't have worked if they hadn't tricked<br/>me, I still can't believe they had me so snowed. They knew I<br/>would have killed them all if I knew what they had done. So<br/>tricked me, they clubbed me over the head while I wasn't<br/>expecting it and gave me to them."<p>He nodded "so why have we not heard from you before now?" he<br/>asked crossing his arms. Ranma snorted looking away "and say<br/>what? 'hi, I'm one of the spawn forced from a girl you<br/>believed had been dead for a long time, oh ya by the way, I'm<br/>half vampire and I burst into flames when my aquatransexual<br/>curse kicks in!' oh ya, I really hoped for the best there!"<br/>he snorted in bitter disgust walking into the kitchen. Akane<br/>looked after him worriedly "he has a point father, he isn't<br/>human." one of the two men said frowning. He shrugged "so?<br/>Hes still family, and innocent from what I can tell. Wheres<br/>your mother boy? Whats your name?" he asked. Ranma blinked<br/>coming back out of the kitchen with a glass of coke "knowing<br/>those demon sucking bastards shes probably knocked up and<br/>working on producing another prize pig for sale." he snorted<br/>walking into the living room and sat down. "And your not<br/>angry?" he asked. Ranma looked at him as he moved over to<br/>sit "why? before coming here my life was shit, neither of my<br/>parents cared for me, know why now!" he said throwing up his<br/>hands "and I also found out I have little value any where,<br/>I'm not even legally a japanese citizen since I was never<br/>offically born."<p>He nodded thoughtfuilly "what have you been doing all this<br/>time then? You don't look like you've been treated like live<br/>stock." he grumped. Ranma snorted "I've been training for the<br/>last fourteen years in every form of weaponless martial arts<br/>fighting style there is, they wanted me to be strong for<br/>their rituals." he spat to the side. He nodded interested<br/>"your skilled?" he asked. Ranma snorted "this town is the<br/>ass crack of earth, I've killed over two hundred demons<br/>since coming here, its a wonder how the slayer here was<br/>never overwelmed, last night I killed twenty demons and<br/>eight vampires, and that was in the first four hours, I<br/>turned in early last night." He nodded grimly pleased "how<br/>did you end up here?" he asked sitting down. Ranma shrugged<br/>"they brought me here. If the slayer hadn't interrupted them<br/>I wouldn't be here now. We had these three come to us when<br/>we found out that they were in danger." He nodded looking<br/>at them "were they used like your siblings?" he asked<br/>calmly. Ranma nodded "Akane had a twin she never met."<p>He nodded slowly looking at the three girls as they bowed<br/>their heads a little in grief "your parents did the same?"<br/>he asked softly. Akane shrugged "the demon said we're owned<br/>by them, the only reason they hadn't taken one of us is<br/>because they were waiting for Genma to make good on his word<br/>and fix the mistake of Ranmas birth." she said softly. Ranma<br/>nodded taking a drink "Genma promised them that he would fix<br/>the problem before taking me off for training. I always<br/>wondered why he was always so angry at me, I guess I know<br/>why." he murmured staring at his glass. The saotome elder<br/>nodded staring at his face "you look like a great<br/>grandfather in a childs body." he murmured simpathetically.<br/>Ranma laughed weakly "how would you feel if your reason for<br/>existing was taken from you to be replaced with the<br/>knowledge that your no better then a cow at a slaughter<br/>house."<p>"I mean, you spend your life thinking your somebody and that<br/>your destined to be a teacher and some day a father and and<br/>your content with that even though you know its not much, I<br/>never had big dreams, all I wanted was to grow up, own a<br/>dojo and have a loving family. A simple dream." ranmas<br/>elder double looked at him sadly "not at all son, its great<br/>dream, everyone has one like it." he refuted softly. Ranma<br/>shrugged looking at his hands "but thats not going to be,<br/>because your just like live stock who didn't know it until<br/>they sold you as a meat product."<p>Akane came over and held him tightly sitting beside him<br/>trying not to cry. The elder saotome looked down unable to<br/>watch, his sons looked at each other sadly and his daughter<br/>bit her lip to keep from crying. "Sir." Gile said sitting in a<br/>chair beside them "we have studied Ranma since finding him<br/>and we have found that he isn't a vampire as we know them, he<br/>has their hightned strength and burns with the sunlight in<br/>his female form, but he doesn't have fangs and doesn't<br/>require blood like other night stalkers do. Fact is ranma<br/>has none of the markers that distnguish humans from vampires<br/>when it comes to evil, his behavior is unchanged from before<br/>the... change, he actively seeks out evil and destoys it when<br/>ever he finds it. Hes helped us a lot, in hunting with the<br/>slayer and helping train her past what I am capable of doing.<br/>I rather think hes come out of this whole mess admirably<br/>well."<p>He nodded "I can see that sir. We thankyou for aiding them,<br/>and for making us aware of whats been happening." Giles nodded<br/>"when we heard we felt it was only right you be informed."<br/>He nodded looking back at Ranma "are you going to be<br/>alright?" he asked softly. Ranma nodded "these days it takes<br/>a massive amount of pain to effect me, I figure I'll be<br/>fine in a few days." he nodded still looking at him "would<br/>you be willing to come back to japan with us?" Ranma looked<br/>protesting "but... we've made a place for ourselves here, we<br/>refuse to let their evil destroy all we believed in growing<br/>up. I own a dojo here in Sunnydale and we're doing good,<br/>besides, I am honor bound to aid the slayer as much as I<br/>can, she has a long way to go before shes learned all I can<br/>teach her."<p>He nodded looking pleased "thats good to hear son, what I<br/>ment was, will you go back with us... to deal with your... to<br/>deal wih those people? And I wish to have you known to the<br/>rest of our family and bring you into the clan as you should<br/>have been from the start." Ranma looked at him slightly<br/>hopeful "I would have thought I would be revolting to you. I<br/>mean, a bastard of an abused daughter of your clan and half<br/>vampire?" he said looking at him. He smiled a little "you<br/>think that is wierd? We have family that are half draconic<br/>demon who change into forty foot tall dragons at will.<br/>Trust me son, we would not turn you away because of your<br/>birth. Even if some would protest, you've earned a place<br/>with us."<p>His sons nodded firmly and his daughter smiled kindly. "How<br/>long would we be gone?" Ranma asked holding Akane. He smiled<br/>"though they are not blood related, they are your sisters,<br/>they can come as well if they wish." he offered. Ranma<br/>blinked a bit looking discontented "I don't know if I want<br/>to think of Akane as my sister." he said frowning. Akane<br/>looked a little hurt and he smiled kissing her softly "I<br/>love you, how am I supposed to be with you the way I want if<br/>your my sister?" he asked smirking a little. She smiled back<br/>"thats alright, my sisters are your sisters." she said<br/>firmly. Both Kasumi and Nabiki nodded firmly. "I gather it<br/>won't be more then four months." the Saotome elder said<br/>assuringly. Ranma smiled at him "then I except. I always<br/>hoped I had more family then Genma and mom."<p>He nodded "do we know what the mans real name is? I dislike<br/>hearing him refered to by my brothers name." he said looking<br/>at him pointedly. Giles nodded "ah, his real name is...<br/>Saroka Ikoga." he supplied looking at a folder he had. All<br/>the saotomes snapped their heads around and he offered the<br/>file to him when he demanded it. He looked at the pictures<br/>and the report narrow eyed for a moment before crushing them<br/>in anger "them." he snarled. Ranma looked curious leaning<br/>voer and touched his mothers image "this is mother." he<br/>murmured softly. He looked at the blankly staring face for a<br/>while as his children crowded around then nodded looking<br/>deeply angry "you have good sources Mr Giles, thorough<br/>report." he said after a while.<p>Giles nodded "we have very professional aid in Willow." he<br/>said waving to the girl. She smiled slightly shrugging "it was<br/>easy to find." she said dimuringly. He nodded "but well<br/>done. Thank you for your aid, the gratitude of the Saotome<br/>clan is no small thing." Giles nodded "we were glad to help,<br/>anything that sets back the cause of evil." he said<br/>shrugging. He nodded "yes, but we owe you all a debt for<br/>saving our lost son and helping find our kidnapped daughter.<br/>I... how long will it take for you to be ready to leave? We<br/>wish to conclude this soon." he said looking at Ranma. He<br/>nodded "I have to call my students and close the dojo for a<br/>while, uh, we'll have to inform the school and the apartment<br/>complex." he murmrured.<p>Giles looked comforting "don't worry about that, I may not<br/>be as high a caliber a sensei as you but I think I can handle<br/>your students while your away, all of your classes were<br/>after school hours after all." Ranma nodded pleased "you keep<br/>the money you earned as sensei, Buffy should take a hand at<br/>teaching, I find that it opens up a vast amount of patience<br/>and confidence teaching others what you know." he said<br/>looking at Buffy. She shrugged "I guess. Giles can tell the<br/>school and you can write a letter to the apartment complex<br/>telling them we're house sitting for you while your away."<br/>Ranma nodded pleased "alright, all we need to do is pack<br/>then." he said pleased and gave Giles his keys and a file<br/>folder box "these are the keys to the apartment and the dojo,<br/>these are the students files, telling pretty much everything<br/>you need to know about them and how much they owe or have<br/>paid." he said.<p>He layed a large book on top of that "this is a book of<br/>progression charts and future study plans I worked up, I<br/>think you should easily handle the next few months worth,<br/>Buffys progression chart and what I planned to teach her is<br/>also in there." He nodded "thankyou, its good to know you<br/>have this organized so well." he said looking through it.<br/>Ranma smirked "thank Nabiki, before she pointed it out to me,<br/>it was all up in my head." he chuckled leaving the room.<br/>Akane got up and followed him with the other two.
