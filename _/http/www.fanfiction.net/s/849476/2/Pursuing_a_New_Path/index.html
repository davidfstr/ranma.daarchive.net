</div><p>Disclaimer: I do not own the characters of Ranma ½ and Ah! My Goddess. They were created by people a lot more imaginative than me. I am also not making any money off of this. This is merely for entertainment purposes.</p><p>Note: This story takes place after the Jusendo incident. Ranma is about to enter his junior year of high school. This story starts towards the end of the summer break.</p><p>Pursuing a New Path</p><p>by ranmafan1</p><p>Chapter 1: The New Guy</p><p>When one would describe Hell, the first terms that may come to mind are fire, brimstone, and endless torture. And for the most part, this was correct. However, lucky for Ranma Saotome he was about to enter Nifelheim, the home of the demons and other agents of chaos, and not Hell.</p><p>Ranma Saotome could not make anything out initially since his head was too busy spinning.  Once everything came into focus, the sight that greeted him was nothing like he expected. Instead of the raging infernos he thought there would be burning, the atmosphere was quite tolerant. In place of the boiling pools of lava, there were gothic-styled high rises and cobblestone roadways. The endless screams of torment were missing as well, instead replaced with the casual conversations of those passing by. There were even children playing tag in the street. In fact, the whole place reminded Ranma of Medieval Europe from history class (which he actually enjoyed).</p><p>Then details started to assimilate into Ranma's brain. First was the fact that integrated into the medieval setting was the most advanced technology he had ever seen. The streets were lined with lampposts, which had floating balls of light on top of them. Within the vicinity he could see several archways were various… people were entering and exiting, seeming to vanish and disappear from them.</p><p>It was starting to occur to him that none of those walking around were human. Most were human-looking, a few even had similar demon markings as him and Mara.  The majority, however, had distinct features that people usually did not have, such as tails and large bat wings protruding from their backs. Some with said appendages were even flying overhead.</p><p>Looking closer at the buildings, or castles as the case might be, Ranma noted some gargoyle like statues hanging on the sides of the building…Oh, wait. The statues jumped off the side and were now flying through the air.  Actually when he looked at the sky Ranma noted that color is red, as if there was a perpetual evening. Ranma could not find a sun, though.</p><p>The most noticeable landmark of the area was the huge skyscraper that seemed to have everything revolve around it. He had never seen a building so tall or so wide before. The shear width of the building was that of at least all of Nerima and he had to strain his neck enough to find its top even at the far distance they were at. Curiously, while the majority of the building had a modernized feel to it, including having sheer black glass windows, the top of it was composed of a castle straight from the Dark Ages, with towers and the like. How they got the two pieces to artistically blend together he would never know.</p><p>Mara smirked at Ranma's dumbstruck expression. It was not often that there were newcomers to Nifelheim. She had to admit, it would be an impressive site for a first-time visitor. "Are you done gawking yet or should I wait a little bit more?"</p><p>Her voice snapped Ranma out of his stupor, but his wide eyes refocused on Mara. "This is hell?" 'This is the place of eternal torment…Seems pretty nice, actually.'</p><p>Mara wagged her finger in front of Ranma's face in a reprimanding manner. "Not quite.  Demons and other such beings do not actually live in Hell. What you see here," gesturing with her hand, "is called Nifelheim."</p><p>This only confused him further. His brow furrows in concentration. "So, there is no Hell? That's just some legend, too."</p><p>"Actually," wagging her finger again, "there is a Hell. In fact, the only entrance for living entities is located several miles below the main office."</p><p>Ranma blinked at the information. "So, what, you just time stamp your hours of torture or something." He involuntarily shuddered. 'Damn, I do not want that kind of job. I've got to get this whole mess straightened out.'</p><p>The demoness scowled at the boy. "Demons do not actually torture souls. Hell is a self-running system. Souls that are damned are tormented by that system based upon the severity to the destruction of their karma.  All we do is maintain the system. And believe me, Ranma," her gaze hardened and he could feel the severity of the statement to come, "any soul that is capable of destroying their karma to that limit has done things that would make you think that they were getting off easy."</p><p>Stunned is an understatement to what Ranma was feeling. In the extremely short time that he had known the demoness, he felt that she was not one to carry such a serious attitude about things, even when she briefly explained beforehand the rules demons had to follow. He simply nodded to her.</p><p>Offering a small smirk, she continued, "Okay, enough of that depressing talk. We're supposed to make people feel that way. We don't have to be that way ourselves." Gesturing towards a nearby archway, she continued, "Let's get this all straightened up." As they are about to walk through, Mara grabbed Ranma's shoulder again. Passing in the gate, they immediately disappeared from the street.</p><p>Ranma found that this teleportation thing got easier the more it was used since he lacked much of the nausea resultant from the last time. Glancing at his surroundings, Ranma noticed that he was in some sort of circular lobby. At the opposite side facing them was an elevator. Mara started to walk towards said location, pausing to turn around. "You coming." Snapped out of his revelry, he followed her. The doors automatically opened upon their approach and closed after they entered. Mara simply stated, "Head office," and the elevator doors opened, revealing a different floor.</p><p>A bit confused, Ranma asked, "Um, Mara, why couldn't we use those arch thingies to simply come here."</p><p>Not bothering turning around, she answered. "The 'arch thingies' are used to simply teleport people into and out of buildings. Different ones are used within the buildings themselves. It's more efficient that way."</p><p>They stepped out into the room, which had all the looks of a waiting room, a beautifully-decorated one though. The room was entirely designed of pale-gray marble, including a desk that was about thirty-some feet from them. Even the majestic door next to the desk was made of marble, but covered with runes of writing Ranma could not understand.  Sitting at the table and filing her nails was a tall and beautiful woman with blue hair, eyes, and lips. Even the low-cut business suit she wore was blue. Though she was not standing up, Ranma could tell that she was over six feet tall. She did not have the demon markings he and Mara possess, but did have a pair of bat wings protruding from her back as well as her head. Ranma followed behind Mara up to the desk. "Sherra."</p><p>Said person did not stop her activities, but nodded and responded. "Mara." After a moment she continued, "You can go right in. The boss has been expecting you." She casually looked at the two. When her eyes focus on Ranma, they immediately changed from informal to hungry. A devilish grin (pun intended) settled on her features and she openly undressed Ranma with her eyes. "Well, hello there," she whispered in a husky tone.</p><p>Ranma was sweating bullets by the look she was giving him. He had seen it before, but something told him she was willing to act on that impulse right here and then. "Um, hello."</p><p>Mara sighed at the display of the succubus. "Not now, Sherra, we have an appointment to make."</p><p>Losing her grin, Sherra pouted at Mara. "Oh, well." She pushed a nearby button. "Go right on in." Allowing a grin to reform towards Ranma, which made him gulp, "And I'll see you later."</p><p>When the marble doors opened, Ranma's senses were overloaded. Powerful simply could not describe the being he felt inside…The strength of the aura was as far beyond Mara's as his was behind hers. Looking wide-eyed at Mara, she offered a victorious grin, clearly enjoying his anxiety.  Almost as an afterthought, Mara gestured inside to capitalize on the predicament. In response, Ranma gulped and reluctantly followed her through the doors, which promptly closed after they entered. Sherra sighed into her chair, already plotting on how to get the pigtailed hunk into the sack.</p><p>Inside Hild's office…</p><p>The central office where Dai Makaichou Hild oversaw all of Nifelheim's operations was not like Ranma expected. He was getting real sick of all these surprises. The room itself was similarly made of gray marble as the waiting room except for the sheer volume being many, many times larger. No, what caught Ranma off guard were the various decorations scattered throughout. Large violet drapes hung off the walls. In the center of the room was a fountain where a female statue was pouring water into the pool below from a jar held in its hands. The pool's water flowed into the base of a large and beautiful tree.  How the tree lived without apparent sunlight Ranma did not know and he was starting to believe that he should stop asking himself those questions around here.</p><p>Turning his gaze towards a large desk at the other end of the room, Ranma noted someone (whom he guessed was Hild) was sitting in a leather chair with its back towards the two other occupants. Ranma could only see hands typing along…some sort of keyboard. The computer looked as if it were just a hologram floating in mid-air. What surprised Ranma was the speed at which the person was typing. He could barely make out the fingers flying through the air. It made his most powerful Amaguriken pale in comparison! All of a sudden the fingers stopped, and one slim digit hit an apparent off key in mid-air since the whole display simply vanished.</p><p>When the chair turned around, Ranma could not contain himself and his jaw dropped in astonishment at the woman he saw. This happened for several reasons.  First was the obvious fact that the woman was stunningly beautiful, with platinum white hair and tanned skin. Instead of slashes and triangles as demon marks like Ranma or Mara, hers were red star figures, one under each eye and on her forehead. The blue and purple dress she was wearing showed a lot more of her figure than even Mara's. However, the most startling fact of the woman was the state of her aura. Even though it possessed exponentially more maliciousness than Mara's, it somehow also contained a strong and equally powerful protective nature. It reminded him of a mother that way. She stood up and gracefully walked around the desk towards the two.</p><p>She greeted Mara with great familiarity. "Ma-chan! How great it is to see you again!"  Turning her gaze towards the newcomer of Nifelheim, she continued, "And you must be Ranma Saotome. It's a pleasure to meet you."  Hild favors him with a smile.</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened at the sincere gesture. He could only gape at the woman until Mara elbowed him in the ribs. Snapping out of his stupor, "Oh, um, yeah, I'm Ranma Saotome…Um, it's nice to meet you too, uh, Hild-sama." Ranma bowed respectfully.</p><p>Hild giggled slightly, while Mara chuckled. "Oh, no need for those honorifics around here, young man. You can call me Boss just like every other demon does."</p><p>"Oh, O-okay, um, Boss." Ranma laughed a little nervously and played with his pigtail a bit.</p><p>Of course, the head demon lord found this adorable. "Oh, aren't you a precious thing!" She proceeded to pinch his cheek a little, making Ranma sweatdrop heavily.</p><p>"So, uh, Boss, Mara," Ranma explained pointing to said demoness, "says that you can straighten this whole mess out. I mean, that wish was an accident and all. So this…contract can be just voided, right?" The last words were spoken with evident hope.</p><p>Hild sighed and her smile turned sad. "I'm sorry, Ranma, but what you are asking for is impossible."</p><p>His hopes shattered, Ranma could only manage out, "W-what…?" Mara herself was surprised by the revelation. The contract should only need to be invalidated. Right?</p><p>Unaffected by the reactions, she continued, "I am not surprised that even Mara does not realize this since this result from a wish is unprecedented. The ascension of a mortal to demonic status has happened before, but the last case of that occurring was thousands of years ago, and all such people were offered the positions upon their deaths. Although since that time, the practice has been banished on both sides since a few cases…didn't work out so well. You are the first and only mortal who has ever ascended this way…It must have been quite painful as a result."</p><p>His head downcast, Ranma was only able to nod.</p><p>"You must realize, Ranma, that all sentient life in the universe has a soul, whether they be mortal, demon, or god. What differs, however, is the nature to that soul. When mortals die, their souls are capable of reincarnation in the mortal plane, to be born again into new lives and exist through different experiences. Demons and gods do not age, and so their price has to be as they are for eternity, while mortals may be good in one lifetime or evil in another. It is part of the balance to the universe, those who live in mortality versus those in immortality.</p><p>As I have said when the practice was allowed, some mortals were offered in the past positions of divinity or demonhood. However, the choice was granted to them upon their deaths. If they accepted, their soul was permanently changed, fixed into the path that they chose. There was no turning back." She paused for a long moment, her eyes sad for the pigtailed martial artist. "I am sorry, Ranma, but you are permanently a demon. I cannot help you."</p><p>Each of her passing words sent more and more despair into Ranma's being. He simply forgot who he was talking to and screamed out what was coming to mind. "Sorry…Sorry! I didn't ask for this! It was just a stupid mistake with a wish I knew was going to be trouble from the start! It isn't fair that I should be stuck like…"</p><p>Hild interrupted Ranma's tirade. "Ranma." That simple word was not filled with anger or malice, but instead commanded respect and silenced him.  "You should know more than most others that life is not always fair."</p><p>Ranma bowed his head slightly in shame. In a low voice, Ranma practically whispers, "I-I'm sorry, Hi- Boss, but I just don't see why things have to be this way."</p><p>Hild continued to examine Ranma, as if seeing whether he was ready to accept her next words or not. "Ranma, do you understand why you were given a wish?"</p><p>After raising his head, Ranma's brow furrowed in confusion. Mara showed similar signs.  "Isn't it because I wouldn't fix up the fiancée mess when I could have and all the stuff that happened because of that?"</p><p>Putting a finger to her chin in contemplation on how to answer that question, she replied after a few moments. "That is part of the reason, but not fully…First, let me explain to you how the wish system works. Many years ago, the gods decided to reward those mortals of pure heart with a wish for all the good that they have brought into Midgard, or Earth as you would call it. In accordance to the rules of balance in all planes, demons must do the same with those opposite to the chosen of the gods. And hence, demonic wishes were born.</p><p>At first, it was thought that those candidates worthy of a wish from us would be the evil-hearted who craved destruction…However, all candidates must be processed through the system to ensure that they would not wish for something extreme that would upset the balance, such as the destruction of the world. With the current parameters, not enough candidates were being found to compensate for those chosen by Asgard…which is our name for Heaven. So, we had to change the parameters of the wish system. Instead of those with 'evil' hearts, the new constraints searched for candidates that promoted, thrived in, and enjoyed chaos. You had fit all of these criteria, Ranma."</p><p>For a few moments, Ranma seemed lost in contemplation. "I get how I helped make the mess worse by not fixing it early on, but what about those other two?  How did I 'thrive in' and how the hell could I possibly enjoy it? I didn't like stupid assholes attacking me for thinking that I stole their 'loves' from them. It wasn't satisfying that those stupid old men would constantly harass me to marry when I ain't ready for it. And I sure as hell didn't like being malleted by that uncute tomboy everyday for putting my damn foot in my mouth or some fiancée glomping onto me."</p><p>Hild raised an eyebrow at his remarks, but didn't say anything. Instead, she walked towards the tree centered in the room and examined it, as if to find something special about it. Without facing him, she finally spoke.  "Tell me, Ranma. What is the strength of your martial arts school, this Anything Goes? What makes it so powerful as compared to another art?"</p><p>This question seems to gave Mara a spark of realization, but Hild glanced at her to keep quiet any remark. Ranma, however, was totally confused as to the relevancy. Disregardless, he answers her. "Our adaptivity.  Whatever style an opponent uses, we adapt to it, integrate it into our own, and defeat it."</p><p>After letting his own words to sink in, she continued, "And how good are you as compared to the others of your Art?"</p><p>Ranma snorted and remarked as usual. "I'm the best."</p><p>Hild glanced sharply at Ranma with a look that stated, 'You had better revise what you just said if you know what's good for you.'</p><p>Sweating a little under the gaze, he amended, "Um, okay, maybe the old ghoul and pervert are better than me, but the old man is the only one of them that's in Anything Goes. I still think, though, that I'm only one in our school with any real dedication to the Art."</p><p>Hild nodded slightly, showing her approval to his revision, which incidentally made Ranma silently sigh in relief.</p><p>"So I take it you must really enjoy your Art…Care to elaborate how the other practitioners do not have such dedication?"</p><p>Organizing his thoughts, he explains, "…I live for the Art just for its own sake. Everyone else in our school uses the Art to gain something from it. The founder, Happosai, is really good, but nowadays it's only because of his experience. That along with all the chasings and beatings he gets from women keeps up his endurance. He gave up long ago in trying to improve his Art in becoming a pervert and all. To him, the Art is to only help him steal panties and get what he wants…Oyaji…I hate to admit it but he could have been better than old freak if he kept up training. Hell, he did create two sets of powerful techniques. Same as the perv, though, he gave up on improving himself by becoming fat and lazy. To pops, the Art was something to help him get an easy life and retirement. Hell, his forbidden techniques were based on thievery…Old man Tendo…the man ain't got any stability to him. He just goes and cries one moment and the next its with his stupid Demon Head trick. To him, the Art is just something to hang onto…and Akane…well Akane just has a big temper and no focus. She expects to be as good as everybody else without working for it, but the way she has always practiced the Art, it's just some hobby."</p><p>There are a few moments of silence after Ranma completed his explanation. "And tell me, Ranma, how did your adaptivity to the Art you so love become so good?"</p><p>Shrugging indifferently, "Well, getting challenged at about anything and everything unpredictably 24/7 can do that to a person. I mean if it wa..sn't…." Ranma trailed off and his eyes widened in realization.</p><p>Hild fully turned around and smiled at the apparent comprehension. "That is correct, Ranma. In the depth of your heart, you enjoyed the chaos because it gave you the perfect opportunity to improve that which you most treasure, your Art. What you did not like were merely the results of the chaos."</p><p>His eyes still wide with insight, he spoke, more to himself it seemed. "A-all this time, a-and I never realized…" After a minute of contemplation, he finally regained focus onto Hild, who was standing before him again. "W-what's going to happen to me now?"</p><p>She folded her arms under her chest. "Well, that depends on you, Ranma. Now that you are a demon, you work for Nifelheim. As such, we need to find you a job."</p><p>"W-what kind of job?"</p><p>Hild shrugged indifferently. "I don't really know yet. You might become a field agent like Mara here. Or you may be a system administrator.  It's also possible that you might be assigned as a guard to either the portal of Hell or even Helheim."</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Ranma noticed Mara blanch at the mention of the latter place and was quite surprised by it. Seeing how the demoness reacted in reference to the name, the martial artist had a feeling he would not like the explanation, but he had to ask anyway. "W-what is Helheim?"</p><p>Hild's visage noticeably darkened, and Ranma was glad that the expression was not directed at him. Her features obtained a faraway look. "All of reality consists of balances…male and female, good and evil,…existence and oblivion. Those beings that live for existence are in balance as well…the gods who exist for order, the demons who were made for chaos, and the mortals who live in between." By now, Ranma was thoroughly enraptured by the story, hanging onto every word.</p><p>"Long ago before the beginning of time, the Void, which only exists for nothingness, created five generals of immense power, the Titans…Ironically, or perhaps purposefully, the avatars of oblivion were based on the five elements of creation, which are wind, water, fire, earth, and lightning. For the first and only time, the gods and demons battled side-by-side. The war was long and costly on both sides, but, in the end, the forces of existence were able to seal away the abominations in an artificially made subspace which is called Helheim. Because only Nifelheim has the necessary system for maintaining such imprisonments, the duty fell onto us to guard the seal and make sure that it will not be broken."</p><p>Awed by the story, Ranma only whispered out, "Woah."</p><p>Hild smirked slightly at the rapt expression on Ranma's face. "So, do you still think that demons can be so detrimental to creation? Although results of our plans may lead to destruction, absolute oblivion is not on our priority list. If not for the combined efforts of both sides, the Void would have won the war so many eons ago and you or anyone else would not exist today.</p><p>The purpose of our kind is to bring chaos to reality. The simple truth is that without chaos, there would be no conflict and it is strife that leads to improvement upon everyone, whether it be demon, god, or mortal."  After a few moments of letting her words sink in, she continued, "So, Ranma, do you feel better of your situation?"</p><p>Ranma was surprised that he actually did feel better about everything. Although he did not fully approve of his current situation, he did understand better the role of everything in the universe. He may not have liked the ideology and simplicity with which some things were explained, but she did mention that there were jobs available were he wouldn't have to hurt people. Tentatively looking at her in the eyes, and gaining strength by the moment, he replied, "I think that I will be able to live with this…I mean, it's just a new challenge for me, and Ranma Saotome does not give up on a challenge!"</p><p>Both Mara and Hild smirked at the confidence returning to his voice. 'It's seems that he is going to be alright,' was the similar thought.</p><p>In his typical nervous gesture, Ranma moved his hand behind his head and played with the pigtail. "Well, I don't think I'd be that great at the spreading chaos bit. I mean, everything I did wasn't really intentional, but those other jobs sound okay, especially being the guard one. I'd be real good at that."</p><p>Hild smiled mysteriously. "We shall see…In any case, what we need to get you is some training with your new status." Her smile widened at seeing him perk up at the word 'training.'</p><p>"Training…what kind of training?"</p><p>"Why spell casting of course!"</p><p>Ranma grimaced with distaste at that. "Ain't know way I'm learning magic. It ain't nothing but trouble."</p><p>Hild raised an eyebrow.  "You do realize that your body is now powered by a magical essence, in particular, pishogue, and not the ki that you are accustomed with. Therefore, using attacks focused with body energy are going to be 'magical.'"</p><p>Sweating a little, Ranma tried a different approach. "Yeah well, the Art takes a lot of practice and dedication to get any good at using energy. Spells are just a bunch of words to do something simply."</p><p>Letting out an overly exaggerated sigh, Hild spoke, though it seemed more to herself. "I guess I should have expected an answer like this. I mean spell casting takes a lot of mental concentration and Ranma only seems being able to think with his fist." After another sigh, "Oh, well, at least I tried." Mara hid a chuckle behind a hand, recognizing what Hild was doing.</p><p>Furious at the blatant insult, "What did you say!" asked Ranma in an almost dangerous tone, disregarding to whom he was speaking.</p><p>Hild acted surprised, "Oh, are you still here?…Well I was just talking about how some spells can require long periods of intense concentration to accomplish, whereas your energy attacks only require a moment or two.  Don't worry. I understand that it may be a bit beyond you. You don't have to learn it if you don't want to."</p><p>Ranma cheeks were practically red with frustration and anger. "Dammit! I am sick and tired of everyone thinking that I'm just some stupid jock! I may not talk the best and I am sure as hell not the best in school, but that doesn't make me a damn idiot!…I'll show you all! I'll learn your magic and I'll prove to you that Ranma Saotome isn't just some idiot!"</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, Hild asked, "Oh, so now you are going to learn spell casting?"</p><p>"Damn straight!"</p><p>Hild clapped her hands in apparent happiness. "Excellent! You will start your training immediately."</p><p>Ranma just looked dumbstruck at the sudden change in attitude and Mara could not hold in her laughter anymore. He slumped his shoulders in defeat.  'Dammit. I did it again. I really need to watch my damn mouth.  It gets me into nothing but trouble.'</p><p>"Now all we need to find you is a tutor." She cocked an eyebrow at Mara, who upon noticing it, stopped laughing and started to sweat herself a little.</p><p>"N-now hold on a minute. I still have my assignment with the Norns and that mortal.  I don't have time to play teacher!"</p><p>Hild waved a hand dismissively. "Oh, you'll have plenty of time to mess around with their lives later. My daughter does a good enough job by herself sometimes…Besides," her eyes slitted ever so slightly, "this is not a request."</p><p>Mara gulped and managed out, "Yes, Boss."</p><p>A smile returned to Hild's face. "Excellent. Before you go, we need to find your file and check its information." All of a sudden, the hologram computer appeared to Hild's right. After typing a little at her incredible speed, a picture appeared on the screen with various bits of information next to it. He noticed that the photo was him, which even had his current marks on the face. "Let's see, Ranma, you are a class three, category one, demon with a probationary license…Mara can explain what that means later. Your transport medium is water…"</p><p>Ranma interrupted Hild.  "Transport medium?"</p><p>Turning her head slightly, "Hmm, oh, well, transport mediums are what allow you to go from place to place. Therefore, in your case, you can use water to go from Midgard to Nifelheim and vice versa, or anywhere in these two planes were water is available."</p><p>Reminded of his curse, "Um, couldn't I just do that transport thing that Mara did before."</p><p>"You could…however, that method requires a lot more energy to do."</p><p>Mara decided to add her two cents. "You see, Ranma, my transport medium are CD's and there weren't any nearby in your house to use, so I was sort of forced to transport the other way you mentioned."</p><p>"Oh, well, it's only because of the curse and I don't really feel like being a girl every time I do a, uh, transport."</p><p>"Oh, don't worry, Ranma, you don't actually have to touch the water to teleport.  What the medium does is allow you to open a portal in it. Now, going back to your file…"</p><p>Now almost shyly, Ranma asked hopefully, "Um, Boss, with regards to my, uh, curse, do you think, that it can be, um, cured?" His look was almost pleading.</p><p>Once again, Hild smiled sadly. "I'm afraid not, Ranma." She noticed that his eyes reflected the disappointment he was obviously feeling. "You see, the magic of the Jusenkyo curse has actually been permanently fused with you as a result of your ascension."</p><p>Ranma's eyes bugged out, "What!"</p><p>Waving her hand to dismiss any tirade that would have followed, she continued, "When you became a demon, the magic of the Jusenkyo curse permanently mixed together with the magic of your new essence…But don't worry too much Ranma, Jusenkyo magic is much weaker than that which composes you. In time, you will be able to control the curse rather than have the water cause the change."</p><p>Ranma seemed to be a lot more placated by this. "O-okay. I can live with that…Control is good…It's not like I haven't gotten used to the curse anyway."</p><p>After a few moments of consideration, Hild added an afterthought. "You know, Ranma, it could be worse."</p><p>Now Ranma raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"</p><p>Nodding her head in affirmation, "Quite so. If you were in your cursed form when the wish was granted, you might have become permanently female."</p><p>Ranma's eye enlarged again. Gulping a bit, "Y-yeah, that's, um, worse."</p><p>Smiling a bit, she turned again to the screen and continued, "Let's see…transport medium is water…ah, and your secondary energy source is…alcohol."  Mara raised an eyebrow at that.</p><p>"Um, secondary energy source?"</p><p>"Oh, secondary energy sources are what you eat or drink to replenish your energy when you can't get sustenance otherwise, which in a demon's case is negative emotions. Mortal food simply does not provide enough energy for our reserves…but don't worry, you can still eat mortal food."</p><p>Ranma gave out a small sigh of relief. He didn't want to give up food. He simply liked it too much after so many nights of starvation during his childhood.  Then the rest of what was said sinks in, making him slightly nervous,  "Um, Boss?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Uncertainly, he asked, "Do you, uh, think that my, uh, secondary energy source could be, well, changed?…The thing is that I can't, um, well, I can't really, uh, drink too well." He blushed slightly, remembering the 'Romeo and Juliet" incident.</p><p>"Sorry, but that cannot be helped. It is what the system has chosen."</p><p>Ranma sighed. "Okay, I guess."</p><p>Mara came up and patted Ranma on the back. "Don't worry too much about it. I'll bring you up to par. It's my secondary energy source as well." She chuckled a bit evilly, causing Ranma to sweatdrop and become uneasy again.</p><p>"In either case, Ranma, with your dual gender nature, it may be possible for you to have another energy source, but you will need your full license to obtain it…So, before you go, do you have any questions?"</p><p>After a few moments of thought, he responded, "Well, several things. First off, what about all the people back home? I mean…I'm not really comfortable about telling everyone that I'm a demon."</p><p>Hild smiled reassuringly at him. "Don't worry, Ranma. You don't have to tell anyone that you don't want to…In fact, you should not tell anyone outside of your family unless necessary. What else?"</p><p>Hesitantly, he asked, "Well, this whole thing started when I basically said that you…we, um, demons get more leeway with pledges and all…D-do you think something can be done?"</p><p>"Hmm, well, something could probably be done, but you have more important things to worry about now, like obtaining your full license, which won't be until you complete your training."</p><p>Ranma sighed, but nodded in acceptance. "Okay. Last question. How is Mara going to get to train me if I'm going home, though? Everyone is gonna be gone only for a couple more days. I can't really miss school. I mean I don't really like it and all, but Mom seems to be really, um, enthusiastic about me getting an education, so…" The unspoken question was left hanging.</p><p>Hild considered the predicament carefully, when a glint came to her eyes. Both Ranma and Mara became very nervous at that look, for it didn't bode well for them. "Well, my dear Ranma and Mara, I have an easy solution."  The sinister smile that was now sporting her face made Ranma sweat heavily. Mara recognized that look and she knew it meant that the Boss had a plan, one that only could mean trouble for her. "Mara, you are now Ranma's latest fiancée."</p><p>If there were crickets around, one would be able to hear them chirping for several moments.  "What!" suddenly replied the duo in question.</p><p>Indifferent to the exclamation, Hild explained. "It's quite simple really. Ma-chan here will come to your home and announce that she is another fiancée that your father bartered for. Everyone will believe it because of your father's character, and your father won't be able to dispute it since he couldn't possibly remember all the times he sold you for dowries."</p><p>Ranma was able to stammer out, "B-but, um, Boss, when the other fiancées find out about it, I'll get beaten down for it!"</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, she retorted, "Oh, and what is going to be so different?"</p><p>Ranma blinked, realizing that nothing would be different. "Oh. Okay."</p><p>Mara sighed, but gave in. She knew that she would never have stood a chance of changing Hild's mind anyway. "Fine, Boss." A mischievous smile came to her face. "Besides, that means I get to spend plenty of 'quality' time with pretty boy here." She directed Ranma a predatory gaze, which Ranma sweated under.</p><p>"Oh, that's enough you two. There's plenty of time for that later. Make sure to stop by legal to fill out the appropriate paperwork, get a false dowry contract made-up, and obtain enough currency so as not to raise suspicion…Now before you go, there is something that I want you to do, Ranma." Her stare gained the utmost seriousness. Mara knew what was coming and resisted the urge to roll her eyes at the high demon lord's antics.</p><p>"W-what is it?"</p><p>All of a sudden, Hild smiled, pulling out of nowhere a tray of…cookies. "Have a chocolate chip cookie. I baked them myself."</p><p>Ranma sweatdropped and successfully fought the impulse to facefault. "W-well, that's nice of you to offer, but…"</p><p>"I insist." Her eyes sparked dangerously, causing Ranma to 'eep'. Therefore, he quickly grabbed a cookie to prolong his continued health. A genuine smile appeared on the Hild's face. "There now, that wasn't so bad."</p><p>Taking a tentative bite, his eyes widened at the taste. "Hmm. This is real good, um, Boss."</p><p>"Why thank you, Ra-chan!"</p><p>Ranma blinked at the nickname, but did not comment.</p><p>"Well, you two have better go along. We all have things to do now. It was good meeting you, Ranma, and it was nice seeing you again, Ma-chan. I hope we all do this again sometime." She made little shooing gestures.</p><p>"Uh, yeah,…I, uh, hope so too….Well, uh, thanks, Boss, for talking with me and all."  He made a small bow afterwards.</p><p>Mara came and grabbed his left arm. "Okay, 'dear', let's get going. See ya later, Boss." The two walked towards the marble doors, which opened when they neared them and closed upon their exit automatically.</p><p>Hild continued to stare at the entrance to her office for a few moments, a contemplative expression on her face. With a small sigh, the High Demon Lord gracefully walked back towards her desk and sat down. After a few minutes of thought, she lazily waved her hand in the air, which caused her holographic computer to reappear. After typing in a long sequence of numbers, Hild waited.</p><p>Suddenly, a picture of a person with indistinct features appeared on the screen. It was nearly impossible to find features of the individual due to the figure being veiled in light.</p><p>The figure finally spoke. "Hild, it has been a long time." The voice was full of warmth and compassion.</p><p>"Yes, it has."  Hild let a small smile grace her face. "So, still going with the mysterious, all-knowing look, huh?" A degree of teasing could be noted within her dialogue.</p><p>The individual chuckled slightly. "It does serve my purposes." After a few moments later, he continued, "So, how goes the new recruit?"</p><p>Hild leaned back into her chair and considered his question a little. "Well enough. The child has potential. That much can be seen from his file alone…However, his very nature seems to be more suited towards your flock than mine."</p><p>"Perhaps. Perhaps not. Only time will tell," the voice cryptically answered.</p><p>"Indeed…What about on your end? This whole situation must be giving yours headaches as well."</p><p>"Nothing that they cannot handle. It shall work out in the end. I have faith in that."</p><p>"Oh…"</p><p>The two remained in amicable silence for several minutes, seeming to communicate without words and thought. Finally, Hild broke the quiet. "It has been good speaking with you."</p><p>"You as well," the figure replied with a hint of regret in its voice.</p><p>Hild simply nodded and pressed the off button. Several more moments had passed while she was lost in her own thoughts. Finally, she reached towards a drawer on her right and opened it. Gently reaching within, Hild grabbed a hold of a brilliantly-decorated violet box. Reverently, she opened it and pulled out a beautiful crystal rose. After studying it thoroughly once more, the Demon Lord gently placed it back into its container, followed by closing the box and putting the item back into its original spot within the drawer.</p><p>Afterwards, Hild sighed and talked to no one in particular, "Well, back to work."</p><p>Outside Hild's office…</p><p>After the doors closed behind him, Ranma let out a sigh of relief. "Boy, that was intense."</p><p>"Oh, you poor baby.  Maybe you should lie down and let me give you a check-up."</p><p>Ranma blinked at the voice. That wasn't Mara's voice. Turning towards who spoke, his eyes bugged out at seeing Hild's secretary, Sherra, standing a few feet from him in a white nurse's outfit.</p><p>"Now why don't you lie down right here," patting her desk, "and let Sherra make it all feel better." A husky smile accompanied the offer.</p><p>Ranma gulped at the sight and was unable to respond . Mara just sighed and continued to drag Ranma towards the elevator. "Not now, Sherra, we have a lot of work to do."</p><p>Sherra pouted again at the demoness, "Hmph. Keeping him all to yourself. How selfish of you, Mara." Looking at Ranma, she winked. "See you later, handsome."</p><p>Ranma was still unresponsive from too much stimulation for the day and was led into the elevator. Only when the doors closed did he snap out of it.  After blinking a couple of times, he sighed, "What have I gotten myself into now?"</p><p>Mara put an arm around Ranma's shoulders. "Cheer up, Ranma. Remember I'm here to help you now." As an afterthought she joyfully added, "This is going to be the start of a beautiful friendship."</p><p>Ranma merely looked at her, then bowed his head slightly and sighed again. "Oh, boy."</p><p>End Chapter 1.</p><p>Author's Notes:  Well, this chapter was basically developed as the first major step in Ranma's transition and I think it turned out alright. Don't expect all chapters to come out this fast, however. It all depends on how the creative juices are flowing. I just thought that I should also note that with respect to Ah! My Goddess material, some elements are going to be taken from the OAV and some are going to come from the manga. Likewise, some things will be left out from the respective sources. We'll see as story progresses. Comments and suggestions would be appreciated. You are the ones who are reading the story.</p><p>-ranmafan1</p>
