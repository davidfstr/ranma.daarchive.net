</div>                Honour and Pride<p><b><i>By Beer-Monster</i></b></p><p><b><i>Book I: The Mantis Saga.</i></b></p><p><b><i>Chapter 6: Mending Wounds..</i></b></p>SHAMPOO<p>The day was dark. Clouds shrouded the sun from view,  making the sky a dull grey and bringing a melancholy gloom inside of the  usually vibrant restaurant. Shampoo sighed wistfully, the only sound in the  room besides the faint squeaking of the glasses as she polished them.</p><p>She was bored. Very bored,  she wanted something to happen, anything. Having lived in Nerima for a year  now, she had grown accustomed to the craziness that had become the status quo  in these parts, and without such weird events everything became tedious and  plain. But with Ranma out of commission the insanity he attracted died down.</p><p>Her browed furrowed at the  though of the pigtailed martial artist. <i>Stubborn fool</i>,</p><p>she thought angrily. Even in the depression that his  defeat had brought him the man simply would not admit he needed help. Why his  mother was worried about his manliness was a mystery to Shampoo, only a man  could be so pigheaded. Women had more wits and that is why they chosen to lead.</p><p>She  sighed again, remembering that his pride and stubbornness was why she was so  drawn to him. Life was ironic, that what she loved most about him was also what  irritated her the most. <i>Stupid Ranma</i> she thought again, cursing him for  making her think this way. Like a milk-hearted outsider and not the Amazon  champion she was.</p><p>The  door opened, ringing the small bell that hung over the top of the entrance.  Shampoo looked up ready to smile warmly and welcome the customer like a good  customer. But it was only Mousse, who stuck his head in through the door and  looked around, squinting through his thick, jam-jar glasses. When his eyes fell  on her, his faced broke into an elated smile. Whipping his glasses off and concealing  them within his expansive sleeves, strode into the restaurant and let the door  swing closed behind him.</p><p>"  Shampoo my love," he called leaping towards her, and falling flat on his face  with a loud crash.</p><p>The  purple-haired girl giggled joyously, seeing that had brightened up her dreary  day.</p><p>Mousse  pulled out his spectacles and peered through them, searching for the reason  behind his comedic fall. His answer came from his robes, the tail of which had  become trapped in the door as it closed. Yanking on the white material he freed  himself and gathered himself to his feet, brushing himself off in an attempt to  preserve his little remaining dignity.</p><p>Keeping  on his glasses so that he could weave in between the tables and chairs he  approached the counter and sat down across from Shampoo who had resumed  polishing glasses.</p><p>" Why  so quiet," he asked in the hope of starting a polite conversation with his  paramour.</p><p>Shampoo shrugged " Is  Monday," she responded. That was the rule in the restaurant business. The  shifts got busier as the week progresses, so on Mondays the place was dead and  by Friday and Saturday nights the place was so crowded that there was no room  to swing a dead cat. Shampoo shuddered at that thought.</p><p>"  Where's the old mummy?" he asked, making Shampoo grimace slightly. Withered or  not, the old Amazon was still her relative.</p><p>" Great Grandmother go to  town, see herbalist."</p><p>"  Oh," Mousse responded intelligently before the room once again fell into an  uncomfortable silence.</p><p>CRASH.</p><p>The  two of them both looked up at the ceiling that was the source of the sound.  Mousse's eyebrows rose in curiosity while Shampoo cursed under her breath in  muttered Mandarin. The only words he caught were Idiot and   Man.</p><p>"  Saotome is up then." He remarked bitterly, she said something in response but  it sounded mostly like an annoyed growl.</p><p>" Has  he done something to you my love?" Mousse said in a soft, concerned tone.</p><p>" If he has I'll…" SLAP.</p><p>Shampoo  stemmed the blind boy's rant by whipping her dishcloth into his cheek.</p><p>Mousse sullenly rubbed his stinging face with a muted  " Ow."</p><p>"  Stupid Mousse, Ranma not do anything. He just stubborn fool. Not let Shampoo  help dress. Seem like he fall on ass." She explained bitterly.</p><p>" THAT BASTARD." Mousse roared. " HOW DARE HE. I'LL  TEAR HIM TO…" He trailed off, blinking rapidly. " Wait a minute, isn't that a  good thing?"</p><p>Shampoo  hit him with her cloth once again and sent him to clean the oven, hoping that  it would shut him up.  The myopic,  martial artist stomped of towards the kitchen, pouting beneath his glasses.</p><p>" At  least he'll be gone by tonight," he murmured.</p><p>His  comment made Shampoo freeze. It was true. Ranma had stayed with them all of the  three days since his battle, and now thanks to Cologne's Amazon salve, his leg  was strong enough to support some weight and he had begun to walk with the aid  of a crutch. Today was the day he returned to the Tendo Dojo, and that very  thought made her day darker than any cloud could have tried.</p><p>Though  his black mood and stubborn, childish behaviour made her hackles rise. She  found great comfort and joy in his very presence. Simply knowing that she could  see him, talk with him (If it could be called talking, and not just single  syllable grunts that sounded vaguely like words). She even watched him  sleeping, smoothing the bangs from his eyes as he snored in a loud but  endearing way. She even smelt him, breathing in the musky, masculine scent of  him as it filled her room. Once again she sighed, this time longingly.</p><p>"  Watcha sighing at Shampoo?" asked the object of her thoughts, in a polite but  downtrodden tone.</p><p>Shampoo  started at the sudden sound of his voice, but covered it by spinning and  turning to him, smiling widely.</p><p>"  Good Morning Ranma," she chimed.</p><p>The  boy reciprocated with a hollow grunt, which may have been the word  "morning".  He hobbled his way through  the kitchen into the restaurant, staring glumly at his crutches as he swung  them before him to take his weight on each step. Slowly he made his way to the  stool Mousse had recently vacated, and bracing one hand upon the counter swung  himself into a comfortable seating position. Folding his arms he leant upon the  table and stared at Shampoo with heavy-lidded eyes.</p><p>" You  think you could explain why Mousse was giving death glares to a sink when I  said Hello?" His voice was light, in a half-hearted attempt at humour, which  completely missed its mark. Shampoo smiled nonetheless.</p><p>" So  what were you sighing at," Ranma asked again.</p><p>"  Just bored, Shampoo guess."</p><p>"  Oh."</p><p>A  long, almost touchable silence hung over them. Ranma became absorbed by his  surroundings, staring across the Chinese watercolour paintings and the  tapestries lining the walls. Shampoo focussed absently on the glass in her  hand, as she polished imaginary smudges and grime away.</p><p>" I'd  better go," Ranma said finally. Gathering his crutches to help him stand.  " I don't want to keep them waiting and give  Akane another reason to be pissed at me."</p><p>" You  no want Shampoo cook breakfast?" she asked, praying silently he would stay. She  watched his eyes light up, gaining some of their former glow at the prospect of  food. But it was only as spark, as the darkness once again clouded in his azure  irises.</p><p>" No  thank you, you've done enough."</p><p>"  Then Shampoo walk with you," she suggested, clinging desperately for any chance  to stay with him.</p><p>At  this suggesting his eyes darkened like a storm, his brows furrowing as his  hackles rose.</p><p>" I  can walk by myself," he muttered in a dangerously soft tone.</p><p>"  But…" she began.</p><p>"  No!" he snapped, then more gently. " No Shampoo, it would just make Akane mad.  I don't need that right now."</p><p>He  turned, an awkward, laboured motion, and began limping towards the door. He had  to clamp on crutch under his armpit and put his weight on the other so that he  would have a hand free to open the door, but he managed with a minimum of  swaying.</p><p>"  Seeya around Shampoo, and thanks. Tell the old bag the same." He said and then  left, never looking back once.</p><p>Shampoo  watched him leave, the glass and cloth hanging forgotten in her hands.</p><p>"   Damn you Ranma Saotome."</p>AKANE<p>KIYAAAAH!</p><p>With  the focus her Kiai brought to her fist, Akane smashed through the thick  concrete slabs, a cloud of dust rising up around her which for a moment before  she absently waved it away with her other hand.  Rising back onto her haunches she shook away the crumbs of  concrete as she withdrew her fist. As part of ingrained ceremony and respect  she bowed to her inanimate opponent then looked down at her handiwork.</p><p><i>Ranma  you jerk, </i>she thought, the mental words so familiar they came by pure  reflex. She remembered his words, his scathing comments as he mocked the art  she had worked hard all her life to master. <i>But, </i>said another mental  voice, <i>you haven't worked all your life. </i>Her angry grimace dropped into  a sad frown, at the truth of it. Her father had not taught her the depth of the  Tendo style until she was ten, before then martial arts had been a mysterious  and funny thing that left her in awe as she practised simple kata. Ranma had  been trained since he could walk, training in the wild, in the world before she  knew how to close her fist properly. Before she had learnt to kick, he had been  thrown into pits of hungry cats. She trained about two hours a day, and then  only if she wasn't ill, tired or too lazy to try. She had watched Ranma train,  for twelve hours at a time, and the intensity of his training terrified her.  She punched bricks while her trust his hands into flames. She fought straw men,  while he fought boulders and giants. She had not sparred with her father for  years, while he regularly fought Genma a fighter far beyond Soun's capacity  with ease.</p><p>And  it was not just Ranma. Ryoga lived his life almost completely alone, seeking  perfection of the art. Who knows what fierce training methods Shampoo had to  face to be worthy of being Cologne's heir, and what Mousse had put himself  through to be worthy of her. She called herself a martial artist, but now she  knew that to them it was just play fighting.</p><p>" My  son makes you doubt yourself," a soft voice said, startling Akane. Ranma's  mother stood in the entrance of the dojo on hand braced against the shogi  doors, the other holding her ever-present katana, free from its wrapping.</p><p>"  Auntie Saotome?"</p><p>" You  should not read too much into Ranma's words, they were ill-spoken and  ill-chosen."</p><p>"  They were still true," Akane said softly.</p><p>" No. Ranma is just  narrow-minded. He sees very little of worth outside the martial arts that he  loves, and has made so many sacrifices for. You should be glad that you have  not made those sacrifices. You see the world as it is, while Ranma is blinded  by his own ignorance. He has wandered from the warrior's path if he had ever  set foot on it to begin with." Nodoka sighed. "But don't worry I'll take care  of it." She said with a distracted smile and left, sword in hand.</p><p>Mrs Saotome's words echoed  in Akane's mind. How would she take care of it? Nodoka was the personification  of prim and proper Japanese ideals. Akane knew that respect was counted very  highly on the woman's list of the qualities expected of a ' man amongst men.'  For Ranma to insult the school as he did must seem an unforgivable sin, but  could she contemplate forcing Ranma to uphold the bargain, to make her only son  commit seppuku.</p><p>These were the thoughts that  clouded Akane's brain as she made to the her way to</p><p>the bathroom. Her concern for Ranma's life warring  constantly with the anger she felt at being insulted as a martial-artist. Her  heart battling her mind, love against passion. Overlaying it all was the  question, would Nodoka ask it of her son, that thought was a bitter one that  left a painful hollow in her chest.</p><p>Entering  the bathroom she was stunned at what she saw. Ranma. He was here already. He  sat on the stool, the steam form the furo condensing on his shirtless chest, as  he bent awkwardly, attempting to remove his black pants. He winced frequently  as his uncoordinated efforts pulled at his injured leg. A pair of steel  crutches leant on the open window, where a broken pitcher indicated his hobbled  entry. His forearm was thinly bandaged, the binds ragged and stained a faint  green by the herbal salve Cologne had applied to facilitate healing. His eyes  snapped up as she entered, darkness clouding his irises.</p><p>"  Ranma?" she said intelligently after watching him, watch her.</p><p>" Do  you mind?" he grunted. " I'm trying to change."</p><p>His  adversarial tone and rude words jolted her from her shocked reverie;  instinctively she dropped into the familiar pattern of verbal sparring they had  endured for so long.</p><p>"  Well if you'd just have come through the door like a normal person you jerk,"  she yelled.</p><p>"  Well excuse me for wanting a bath first," he retorted. " Unlike some tomboys I  know I don't like being sweaty and smelly."</p><p>"  Ranma!" she shouted as she advanced, fist raised. Then she stopped mid-swing as  she watched Ranma grimace in pain as he pushed himself back on his stool,  putting agonising pressure on his injured leg. He barely registered her  hesitation as he returned to the painful task of shedding his trousers.</p><p>"  Do…" she tilted her head. " Do you need some help Ranma?" she offered.</p><p>" I  DON'T NEED ANY HELP," he spat, his face growing red and livid.</p><p>Akane  gasped, shocked by his violent reaction to what seemed like a friendly gesture.  Never one to be cowed she prepared a volley of shouts, but was intercepted by  Ranma fixing her with a stern glare.</p><p>"  Just go Akane, get out" he hissed. " I'm not such an invalid that I can't bathe  myself."</p><p>Akane  turned and left as he had asked, still gaping at the change in Ranma, letting  the door close softly behind her, wishing that she could close off the hollow  in her heart.</p>NODOKA<p>With  her hand buried to the wrists in warm water and soap suds, Nodoka Saotome  watched the girl chosen as her future daughter-in-law, walk past the kitchen  door, pain and sadness etched on her face.</p><p>" It  looks like Ranma's taking a bath," Kasumi observed, her usual cheer sounded  forced as she continued dicing vegetables. The knife moved faster, the blades  slicing the carrots with more force.</p><p>Nodoka  sighed and returned to scrubbing the pots. It seemed as if her son had said  something tooffend his fiancé again. For the infinite time, she cursed  Genma for taking Ranma from her. But that was not his fault. In many ways Genma  had done his job and had made their son a man amongst men. But in other ways  the boy was a hideous disappointment. It was a paradox how Ranma could be  everything she wanted her son to be, and everything she had hoped he would  never be.</p><p>The  curse did not matter to Nodoka anymore; the true qualities of a man went deeper  than anatomical changes. But the flaws in Ranma's bearing, speech and  personality could not be excused so easily. But she would take care of it, as  she had told Akane. There was no one else to clean the mess that was Ranma  Saotome.</p><p>" <i>A  child is a blend of his parents. Greater than the sum of his parts, yet wholly  dependent on them." </i>Cologne's words, spoken in a voice rasped by age, yet  strengthened by wisdom.</p><p>It had been after their  visit to the Nekohanten, when she had descended the stairs from Shampoo's room,  her knuckles white on the sheath of her sword as she walked, not looking back,  not wanting to face the shame that she called her son.</p><p>Genma had walked in front of her, red-faced with  anger as he muttered under his breath about " ungrateful brats," and " respect  for his teacher." Not as hypocritical a statement as it sounded, as though  Genma hated much of what Happosai had put him through, he still respected the  old perverts superior knowledge and the training methods that made him a  formidable martial artist.</p><p>Akane had stormed off ahead,  now invisible but for the red glow of her battle aura on the horizon.</p><p>Then she had felt a light  touch on her shoulder, she turned to stare into the ancient and withered face  of the Amazon matriarch as she perched on her staff.</p><p>" Miss Saotome, might I  speak with you for a moment? " Cologne said politely.</p><p>" Ah yes Elder Cologne,  please allow me to apologise for burdening you and your restaurant with my son,  especially in his current state."</p><p>" No need. The boy is  headstrong but nothing I can't handle."</p><p>The ancient warrioress,  pogo-ed over to one of the restaurants booths, and hopped in, sitting  cross-legged on the cushion, with an open hand she gestured for Nodoka to join  her. The Saotome woman remained standing, watching Cologne apprehensively.</p><p>" I hope this is not about  my son, and his 'engagement' to your grand-daughter." She said politely, but  firmly.</p><p>Cologne smiled, making the  flesh on her cheeks appear even more creased and wrinkled, " If I had thought  that would work, I would have approached you long ago." The old woman's smile  vanished and she fixed Nodoka with a suspicious glare. " No, rather this is  about your relationship with your son."</p><p>Nodoka recoiled, almost  standing from shock. She had not expected this line of inquiry.</p><p>" What do you mean?" she  asked tersely.</p><p>" Your disappointment in him  is unfounded."</p><p>" He has acted like a spoilt  child, and the way he spoke to his father and to his fiancé are justification  enough for my shame."</p><p>" Then perhaps you should  blame yourself."</p><p>Nodoka gawped before anger  replaced her surprise. " How dare you? Ranma's failings are not my fault, I did  not raise him."</p><p>" And by that admission you  confess your guilt," Cologne snapped.</p><p>Nodoka stood indignantly,  staring daggers at the old woman. " I will sit her and be criticised by a woman  who threw her own granddaughter into a cursed spring."</p><p>She turned to leave, head held high. Only to have the way barred  by Cologne's staff.</p><p>" Rich words coming from a  woman who carries a Katana ready for the day her own son falls upon his sword."  Her words were soft and dangerous. " Now sit or be sat."</p><p>Pride falling before fear  Nodoka did as she was bidden, taking her seat across from the matriarch.</p><p>" Thank you," Cologne said  in a more normal tone. " You see the flaws, yet grow angry when he finally  realises that which may help him change for the better."</p><p>" What?"</p><p>" Like all things in life  the raising of a child is a matter of balance. The child is a blend of his  parents, greater than the sum of his parts, yet wholly dependent upon them.  From Genma, Ranma learnt martial arts, and Genma did his job well." Cologne  snorted.</p><p>" As much as I despise the bald tub of lard, he did  train his son to be a truly magnificent fighter. The boy has more skill and  more potential than I have ever seen, greater even than Happi's in his youth.  But such training must be balanced."</p><p>Cologne  fixed Nodoka with a sharp, reproachful glare. " That was your job." She said  curtly. " As his mother you had as important a part to play in the upbringing  of your child as his father, maybe more so. When Genma trained his son to be a  superb martial artist, from who was he supposed to learn love or compassion,  bravery or temperance. In all of those respects your husband is a dismal  failure. You wish for your son to possess the qualities of a true man, and you  expected that fat oaf to teach him. You say your son has no sense of honour. I  disagree, he has a very, strong and honourable soul. It is his definition of  honour that is wrong, tainted by arrogance and selfishness learnt from his  father."</p><p>Nodoka  listened to this and knew she was beaten. <i>Checkmate</i>, her brain conceded.  But she refused to go down without a fight. " That may be true, but as you said  my husband taught Ranma to be a great fighter, he should at least be man enough  to show respect for his school. But does he? No he insulted it."</p><p>"  That is true, and to tell you the truth I can not think of a better thing for  him to do." Cologne said with a smile.</p><p>" You  think his disrespect is a good thing?" Nodoka asked dryly, wondering if the  woman had gone mad.</p><p>" I  think it shows that there is still hope. As with addicts the first step to  change is seeing the problem. The pervious masters of the school, Genma,  Happosai, both were martial geniuses, but both were men with weak spirits and  ethics. When Happi founded the school he was an honourable and powerful martial  artist, and his art was respected and feared. But as he aged he grew more twisted,  and through his later influence and that of your husbands, the Anything-Goes  School became tainted. They began to slip in sneaky and despicable tricks. That  Ranma has finally realised this, that he can   see the 'worm in the apple', speaks well for him. It shows that the  effects of Genma's teachings have not been total and that the boy can still be  shown the true path. It may still be too late, but there is still a sliver of  hope."</p><p>"  Hope," Nodoka repeated, now knowing that Cologne had beaten her. That Ranma's  failings were her own.</p><p>"  Yes, if you choose to see it." Cologne said. " Perhaps Ranma could still be  your man amongst men."</p><p>The  word 'man', stirred something in Nodoka and some of her fire returned, as did  her suspicion.</p><p>" Why  do you care if Ranma is a ' man amongst men'?"   She asked angrily. " As an Amazon do you not see men as weak and  inferior."</p><p>" Do  not be stupid girl," Cologne snapped, Nodoka frowned at being referred to as  'girl'. " I am offended at the accusation and of your attitude towards my  tribe. I have not lived three hundred years by ignoring the potential of men."</p><p>" But  I thought…"</p><p>" I  know exactly what you thought," Cologne broke in. " And you are wrong. Once it  was as you said, but I am not as blind as the matriarchs of past and the  warriors who cannot see past petty prejudice. The reason that women have more  say in our clan, is that of logic as two thousand years of Amazon history has  proven. Men often lack control of their emotions, too quick to anger, too  blinded by pride. It has taken the touch of a woman, wisdom, compassion and  restraint to ensure our clan's survival, especially during the dark times, when  the Musk, the Phoenix, and the Joketsuzoku waged war. The qualities that make a  good man are the same that make a good woman in our tribe, it is just that men  exhibit such qualities rarely. Your son is one of those in whom I see such  potential, amongst others. But in the eyes of heaven both men and women are  equal, so I would re-evaluate some of your stereotypes." The ancient matriarch  drew herself up proudly, sniffing indignantly.</p><p>Nodoka  blushed, embarrassed at her own ignorance and the berating she had received  from Cologne.</p><p>" But  what about the way you treat Mousse?" she asked in a meeker tone. " The boy is  brave, strong and loyal. Does he not possess the qualities of a man worthy of  respect."</p><p>"  Indeed he does, and he has my respect." The old woman's mouth tightened and her  eyes narrowed in extreme vexation. " But it is extremely difficult to show such  respect when he makes such a fool of himself in the way he constantly moons  after my granddaughter, it's embarrassing." Cologne blew out a hiss of air in  annoyance.</p><p>" Be  that as it may, Mousse is the most impressive male our tribe had produced in  three generations. As you have said his loyalty and determination are worthy of  admiration." She leant forward over the table, smiling proudly. " Did you know  the style he uses, the Art of the Hidden Weapon. He invented it himself."</p><p>"  Really? But he's so young," Nodoka replied amazed that a teenager could have  discovered and entirely new method of martial arts.</p><p>"  Surprising is it not. That is the result of Mousse's loyalty to Shampoo. In our  tribe males are taught the unarmed martial arts as they are forbidden to carry  weapons." Nodoka opened her mouth to comment, but Cologne beat her to it. " An  old tradition, too old and to deeply ingrained to be changed. However I have  made it so that truly talented males may learn the staff and the sword. However  such a reward is rare. Mousse, although talented, was always held back by his  poor eyesight and so never progressed enough to earn the full training. Or so  it was until he got his new triple strength prescription and happened past  Shampoo one day while she bathed in a nearby spring."</p><p>She sighed again. " Do you  believe in love at first sight Mrs Saotome? I never did until that day. And as  much as I hate the idea that the fool's feelings are genuine, the truth is a  that no-one could be so stupid and so embarrassing if he was not truly  besotted."</p><p>" Since that day Mousse  became driven by his desire to make Shampoo love him. He knew that she would  not even look in his direction unless he was skilled enough to defeat her and  so he threw himself into his training. Practising morning, noon and night at  the expense of all else. His strength and skill grew, no one knew of his real  talents until I found him late one night. I had been restless one night, unable  to sleep due to a powerful aura near the village. I traced it to it's source  and there found Mousse, effortlessly moving through a kata with a staff, the  weapon moving so fluidly it seemed part of him. Although I was truly impressed  by the boy's improvement, it was still forbidden for him to touch a weapon. I  may not be fond of the law but I was still the matriarch and it was my duty to  make an example of him. I felt that a small beating would suffice, but then  recoiled in shock as he made the staff disappear. It simply was there, and then  it was gone, vanishing in the folds of his robe. And without a pause in the  flow, he pulled a large sword from his sleeve and began practising with that.  To this day I still do not know how he does, and nor will he share the secret  with anyone. I believe it has something to do with creating an envelope in the  dimensions of space using his Ki, yet I just can't figure out how. The robes  are just cover, a plug over the hole. But I digress. I had left Mousse to his  own devices, to see how the technique would progress. But the fool revealed  himself, during one of the male tournament. Shampoo had been in the audience,  in an attempt to impress her he knocked his opponent unconscious with a Disney  character that he had somehow hidden. Just pulled out a black-eared mousse and  cracked the boy around the head with it. It took a lot of string-pulling to not  have the council exile him, but he was disqualified from the tournament."</p><p>" Such a change for the  woman he loved, how romantic." Nodoka said absently, wondering when the last  time Genma had done anything romantic was. <i>Hm, when was 197?. </i></p><p>" You could say that, but  mostly I would say it speaks of his loyalty, to Shampoo and to his tribe both  are unquestioned."</p><p>" If his method of gaining  Shampoo's affections trouble you could you not make him change them?" Nodoka  asked curiously, wondering how Ranma could be made to change his own ways.</p><p>To this Cologne's reply was  laughter. A cackling sound, like the caw of a crow.</p><p>" Girl," she breathed out between guffaws. " You  misunderstand. You cannot make someone change. You can only show them the path;  it is up to them to take the first step. If they desire to."</p><p>Nodoka  watched her son pick and scowl at his food. The stared at him then at the blade  of her sword, ignoring Genma's blubbering and cold sweats. <i>It is a mother's  duty to raise her son right, </i>she thought. <i>And it is also her duty to  resolve the mistake when she fails. </i></p><p>To be continued.</p><p>AN- Sorry I don't update more, and I hope none of you  have forgotten this story or me. Unfortunately, its only going to get slower.  You see this September I started university, I am a Physics student at  Loughborough University (one of the best science schools in England), and you  would not believe how much work is involved. So it makes it hard to find time  to write, not to mention find inspiration when surrounded by equations all the  time. Nevertheless I shall endeavour to continue this saga, and start on  others. As long as I read enough good Ranma fics, and practise my martial arts  to keep interested, this story should flow. But still I am sorry I don't write  faster and hope you will continue reading.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Beer-monster.</p>
