</div> <i>Honour And Pride</i>    By Beer-Monster.         Book I: The Mantis SagaChapter Seven: Lighting Fire.         RYOGA<p>The  street was like any other in Tokyo. Filled with a heaving, pulsating throng of  people. They flowed like a river, wave after wave of bodies streaming in a  turbulent current. And like the river, the flows part for the rock jutting in  the waters path. However, unlike the river this rock moved. It came in the form  of a young man with dark, tousled hair barely visible behind the map that he  held close to his face. He waded through the sea of humanity ignorantly, not  noticing that when he bumped into another person, that unfortunate body was  hurtled forcefully from his path. No, the youth just carried on walking sending  more people flying into the walls of nearby buildings.</p><p>" How  did I get stuck in the middle of this forest?" Ryoga mumbled as he twisted the  map left and right in his grip.</p><p><b>WHACK,</b>  another bystander knocked into the air.</p><p>" And  why are these trees so close together?" <i>I can barely go a step without  hitting one</i>.</p><p><b>BANG!</b></p><p>"  Hey watch where your going you jerk!"</p><p>" And  why are the trees insulting me?" <i>Wait a minute. Talking trees?</i></p><p>Ryoga  lowered the map, his green eyes widening as he saw the endless sea of bodies  massed over the street. His jaw dropped revealing his fangs. Then he growled.</p><p>" AW  CRAP!" he screamed. " NOW WHERE THE HELL AM I?"</p><p>"  You're in Tokyo you nut," replied one of the passers-by as he walked past the  shouting lunatic.</p><p>"  Tokyo," he repeated, eyes watering with joy.   <i>Akane, you're so close. </i>Birds sang and bells rang as he imagined  his triumphant return to the smiling face of the one he loved.  Eager to be reunited with his beloved, he  reached out and grabbed a body from the passing stream of people.</p><p>"  Which way to the Tendo Dojo?" he yelled into the young woman's face. Already  planning his romantic confession of love and his defeat of Ranma.</p><p>"  Well Ryoga," responded a familiar, dry voice. " If you put me down and give me  two thousand yen, I might tell you."</p><p>He  focussed his eyes on the face of the woman in front of him, the details  accreting in his mind. Pretty. Short, brown hair. Hazel eyes. Crooked smile.  Sarcastically, arched eyebrow. And the really, big giveaway; demanding money.</p><p>"  Nabiki," he said in recognition. Then he noticed that he was still lifting her  up by her shoulders and put her down. Hand straying behind his head to scratch  timidly at his scalp. " Sorry about that, heh heh heh." He said with a blush  and a wide, fanged smile.</p><p>"  Yeah, yeah whatever." she said with a dismissive gesture. " Now, do you want me  to show you the way home or not?" She extended out her hand, palm flat and  pointing skyward.</p><p>Heaving  a heavy sigh the lost boy dug around in the pockets of his black pants, and  then in his yellow jerkin, finally extracting two one thousand yen bills, which  he deposited in Nabiki's hand.</p><p>"  Thank you," she said shortly, before crooking a finger to indicate that he  should follow. " This way."</p><p>The  two weaved their way through the mass of people. Moving through the streets,  some less crowded some more. Neither talked, Ryoga concentrated on keeping his  eyes on the girl in front of him so as not to take an unscheduled detour via  Ulan Bator. Nabiki just thought that speaking to Ryoga would be a waste of her  time and oxygen. After some time the density of people lessened until there  were walking amongst a sparse handful of pedestrians, and eventually they  reached the sloping roof, shoddily, patched fence and kanji sign that heralded  their destination.</p><p>"  Here we go Ryoga, one dojo." Nabiki said with mockingly false grandeur.</p><p>"  Thanks," he said absently as he swung his mammoth pack from his shoulders,  pulling his heavy red umbrella from its bindings and slashing through the air,  ready for when he encountered Ranma. Priorities come first, though.</p><p>"  Where is Akane?" he asked the middle Tendo daughter.</p><p>" Now  Ryoga, you know information costs extra," she replied.</p><p>With  an exasperated sigh he began digging through his pockets again.</p><p>"  Ryoga, what are you doing here? How have you been?"</p><p>The  lost boy pulled his hands from his pockets at the melodious sound of that  voice. Sparing a mocking glance at Nabiki, he turned to Akane with a wide,  fanged smile and fumbled greeting.</p><p>"  He…hello Akane. Lovely day isn't it. I was just passing through. Heh Heh."</p><p>"  Well it's good to see you come in," she said cheerily taking her friends hand  leading him into the house. Nabiki scowled muttering in annoyance at the lost  sale. Ryoga did not notice as he was flying high on cloud nine, <i>I'm holding  Akane's soft, delicate hand. As a human and not a pig. As Ryoga, and not  P-Chan. </i>He thought deliriously, not notice that said ' gentle hand' was  rough and callused from punching bricks and hard pig-tailed heads. <i>What a  joyous world it is to live in.</i></p><p>" So  where have you been?" Akane asked politely.</p><p>"  Well I went to train in Hokkaido?"</p><p>"  You're so dedicated, always training. I wish I could train in far off places,"  she said. Then muttered lowly. " Then that jerk would take me seriously."</p><p><i>Ranma  has upset her again, the bastard. </i>" Well it's not all that fun, I nearly  got eaten by a tribe of cannibals." He said while plotting his vindication of  the braided scum.</p><p>"  Cannibals? In Hokkaido?"</p><p>" I…I  think I may of gone the wrong way again. Heheh." Ryoga began scratching the  back of his head again while grinning stupidly.</p><p>" Who  is your friend Akane?" A new voice broke in.</p><p>Ryoga turned to the  newcomer, finding himself, facing a handsome woman of middle years. Her hair  was a dark auburn, the curls held in a loose bob. She wore a simple blue  kimono, and had a braided leather baldric hanging across her shoulders, from  which hung a plain but amazingly well crafted katana. She looked back at Ryoga  with cerulean eyes, regarding him from head to toe appraisingly. Ryoga fidgeted  nervously, feeling as if the woman could see through his clothes to every  stitch of his boxers. There was something familiar about this woman he could  not place.</p><p>" Good afternoon  Auntie," Akane greeted the newcomer. " This is Ryoga Hibiki, he's a friend of  Ranma's."</p><p>Ryoga scowled at being  referred to as a friend of that git, but repressed any verbal protest as the  woman approached him. Her stare even more intense, more judging taking the  measure of him.</p><p>" You have the bearing  of a martial artist, that is plain to see." The woman said, once again sweeping  her gaze from his hair to his shoes and back to his eyes. " You must be a  powerful fighter to be a 'friend' of my son."</p><p><i>Her son! </i>"  Your Ranma's mother!"</p><p>" Nodoka Saotome,  pleased to meet you Mr Hibiki."</p><p>The familiarity of her face  came striking back to him. She looked like Ranma, especially in his girl form  when the fiery red of his hair echoed the auburn of the lady's before him. This  was Ranma's mother, and she saw right through Akane's ruse. She knew that the  bandana-wearing boy in front of her was not Ranma's friend but his rival.</p><p>" So where did you  learn the martial arts Mr Hibiki?" she asked.</p><p>" Well, my father  taught me a little and I just kind of picked up the rest," he replied staring  nervously at his feet as he shuffled nervously.</p><p>" So mostly a self-taught warrior, and with  such obviously high skill. You must be very dedicated." She said appraisingly.  " So how did you come to meet Ranma?"</p><p>" Er… we met in junior high when he and his  father stopped through."</p><p>"  Junior High, interesting. So you've been 'friends' with him that long?"</p><p>" Well…uh" Ryoga fumbled, lost for words.</p><p>" Well I'd better let you  and Akane catch up," Nodoka said, smiling benignly at Akane. " But I hope to  speak with you again before you leave, Mr Hibiki."</p><p>That prospect left Ryoga with an unsettling  sensation sinking in his stomach as he watched the retreating form of Ranma's  mother. Some part of his instincts told him that another conversation with Mrs  Saotome would be unpleasant.</p><p>" So now you've met Auntie  Saotome," Akane said.</p><p>" She was very polite."  Ryoga said absently, his discomfort at his uneasy introduction to Nodoka, and  at Akane's proximity, prevented him from thinking up anything more intelligent  to say.</p><p>" Yes," Akane agreed. " It's  hard to believe she married that fat oaf."</p><p>She started laughing, a  sound that sounded like beautiful music to Ryoga, and he laughed with her,  chortling heartily.</p><p>" Or that she gave birth to  that jerk," he said between chuckles, hoping to expend on the joke. He laughed  harder at his jest before noticing that Akane had fallen silent, staring at her  own ringing hands with a vacant expression.</p><p>" What is it Akane?" he  asked softly.</p><p>She  jumped at the sound of his voice, as if she had forgotten that he was there.</p><p>" Oh it's nothing." She replied.</p><p>" You  can't fool me Akane." He said in a firm but gentle tone." C'mon you can trust  me," he smiled warmly, a gesture offset by the feral image of his fangs.</p><p>"  It's Ranma." She said after a while.</p><p>Upon  hearing that name Ryoga's gentle, concerned exterior crumbled. " That bastard!"  he growled, swinging his umbrella around angrily. " I should have known. If  he's done anything to hurt you I'll thrash the life out of him." He raged.</p><p>" Oh  no Ryoga, it's not that he hasn't done anything wrong." She declared waving her  arms in a claming gesture. The words had the desired effect as his fury  deflated as if someone had poked a pin in.</p><p>"  Huh," he said bemused.</p><p>" He  hasn't done anything wrong. Well he has, he's being an arsehole. But it isn't  his…but he…and…," She sighed loudly, her shoulders slumping. " I just don't  know Ryoga. I just don't."</p><p>"  Akane?" he asked, forcing himself to remain calm. " What happened?"</p><p>" He  lost a fight," she muttered.</p><p>A  whirlwind of emotions tore through Ryoga's brain. First satisfaction, <i>Hah the bastard finally got what he  deserves. </i>But also rage <i>It should have been me. Only I am allowed to  defeat Ranma, to</i> <i>see him brought low. </i>There was also disappointment, in himself <i>I should have trained harder, should have  beaten him long ago, now it's been stolen from me. </i>And disappointment in Ranma, <i>How  could he have let himself lose? </i>The  sensations and thoughts spun and whirled around the lost boy's mind.</p><p>Akane  noticed her companion's silence. Ryoga seemed to have withdrawn into himself,  his eyes dull and spacey. His whole body seemed frozen, except for the  trembling of his hand where he held the handle of his umbrella in a white  knuckled fist.</p><p>" I'd better start from the beginning. I'll ask if Kasumi  can make us some tea." She said, taking Ryoga's hand to lead him into the  kitchen.</p><p>She told him the events of the last few days, Happosai's  return, bruised and broken. Ranma's challenge to Loaf the master of the Mantis  Fist, and his subsequent defeat. And of Ranma's dark and adversarial behaviour.</p><p>" He's acting so strange, furious one minute, and  despairing the next. And it's been three days since he came back. His loss had  made him different. I mean he was always an impolite jerk, but now he's being a  real bastard, snapping at anyone even Kasumi, and that's only if he speaks at  all." Akane said, her voice strained and desperate.</p><p>" What a wanker," Ryoga spat. " That is not how a man  should act."</p><p>" That's another thing, he spend most of his time as a  girl now, only becoming male when he bathes, and not staying like that for  long. It's like he doesn't care if he's a man or not, or about himself or the  people around him. It's like none of it matters to him anymore."</p><p><i>I'll  kill him for making you worry like this Akane, </i>Ryoga silently vowed.</p><p>" Ryoga," Akane said, quietly almost shyly. The lost  martial-artist felt his heart melt beneath his course jerkin.</p><p>" Y…Yes. A…Akane."</p><p>" Do you think you could talk to Ranma? Y'know maybe  cheer him up, drag him out of this rut?"</p><p>Ryoga's  melting heart froze to the core, the cold sending stabbing pains through his  chest. With a crack his heart shattered, he could hear the pieces drop to the  floor. He wanted to refuse; he wanted to shout, to punch a hole in the wall, to  tell her that she should love him. But he could only sit there, silent.</p><p>"  You're a martial artist too, you can sympathise with what he's going through,  and maybe you can help him." She said, her voice even more strained.</p><p>Ryoga  did not move, he did not even breathe.</p><p>" I  know the two of you fight a lot. But surely that's just some macho, pride  thing. I think deep down, he respects you and considers you a friend."</p><p><i>If  I'm his friend why does he enjoy making my life hell?</i> He thought sullenly.  But still he did not speak.</p><p>"  Please Ryoga, he needs your help." Leaning across she squeezed his left hand in  both of hers. " Please Ryoga, for me."</p><p><i>I  would do anything for you Akane, </i>he pledged silently.</p><p>"  Okay Akane, I'll try."</p><p>She smiled, lighting her face. "  Thank you Ryoga," she said. At any other time such a smile would have made him  giddy, but his heart was still in pieces.</p><p>"  Don't mention it," he muttered, gulping down the last of his tea.</p><p>Ryoga  found Ranma's room quite easily (meaning he only walked into the closet four  times and on Soun in the bath once, and did not end up in the Scottish  highlands.) The room was dark when he entered, the curtain closing off the  light of day but for a foggy gloom, which reflected the mood of its occupant. Ryoga  could make out Ranma lying on the bed, scowling at the ceiling. True to Akane's  word, his rival was currently female, her red hair mussed with her braid  drooping across the pillow. She had not bothered to dress, still garbed in the  thin vest that she usually slept in and, Ryoga guessed, nothing but boxers  beneath the bed sheet that covered her to her chest.  In the murkiness of the room, he could barely make out the  bandages looped around her slender arm loosely, obviously fitted to her male  form.</p><p>" Should  I be surprised to see you?" she said suddenly making Ryoga start. She had not  turned to him as she spoke, just continued gazing blankly upwards.</p><p>" I  knew that you would come to gloat, eventually. But then I was sure that you  would be too lost to get here." She chuckled, a dry sound with no humour in it.  " So tell me P-Chan, should I be surprised?"</p><p>Ryoga  snorted angrily, " I see that Akane was right, you are acting even more of a  prick than usual."</p><p>" So  we kick off your gloating with insults about my character. Not very original,  but I suppose everyone has to start somewhere. And you never were the smartest  pig in the sty were you." Ranma muttered dryly.</p><p>"  Ranma!" he growled.</p><p>"  Yeeees," she replied dragging the word out mockingly.</p><p>" I  did not come here to gloat," Ryoga barked, forcing himself to calm down.  "Although I can't say I'm sad to hear that  you lost."</p><p>Ranma winced, barely but Ryoga saw  it.</p><p>" Oh yeah, I bet this is  getting you off isn't it P-Chan."</p><p>" Actually Akane asked me to  see if I could help you, pull you out of this rut. But why she cares is beyond  me." Ryoga explained.</p><p>" Oh is the tomboy worried," Ranma wailed  sarcastically. " She probably just misses her favourite punching bag. Tell her  someone got there already," he held up his bandaged hand for emphasis.</p><p>"And you deal with your  defeat by bullying women. She told me how you insulted her and her  skills."</p><p>" Well the macho chick picks  on me whenever she's depressed. What can I say? Payback's a bitch."</p><p>" She's a girl," Ryoga  sneered. "<i>You</i> are <i>supposed </i>to be a man."</p><p>" The breasts make that one  a bit difficult," she said, pointing towards her chest.</p><p>" The curse is no excuse  Ranma,"</p><p>" It  seems to be all the excuse you need to sleep with her pig." Ranma hissed.</p><p>Ryoga  fell silent, grinding his teeth together. Ranma had him there, and both of them  knew it.</p><p>"  Besides," Ranma sighed breaking the silence. " She needed to hear it."</p><p>" She  needed you to insult her," the bandana-clad boy growled dryly.</p><p>" She  thinks she is a martial artist, when she has no idea what one is."                                      </p><p style="text-align:center;">" What are you  babbling about Ranma? Her father trained her in the Anything-Goes school just  as yours did."</p><p style="text-align:center;">" It takes more  than knowing how to throw a few kicks and punches to make a martial artist."  Ranma replied in a bored tone.</p><p style="text-align:center;">" Get  to the point Ranma?" Ryoga snorted.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"  Akane, she's just like the thousands of other practitioners of the combat arts  out there. A part-timer; a sportsman. She doesn't want to admit it, but to her  it's a hobby. Something to do to occupy the time, to keep fit. She was telling  me how she would like to act when she graduated, or be a doctor (she would  probably kill more patients than she saved the klutz,), or travel to France. To  a true Martial Artist, these things mean nothing. All that exists is training,  fighting, and becoming strong." Ranma voice had dropped, taking on a dull, lost  tone.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"  That's bullshit Ranma," Ryoga declared, dismissing the red heads argument with  a sweeping gesture.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"  Don't lie to yourself Ryoga," Ranma snarled. " Tell me, what do you desire  truly. Besides trying to get Akane to give you the time of day, or beating my  head to a pulp, when have you ever wanted more than to train, to perfect the  Art? Why did you learn the Shi Shi Hokodan or the Bakusai Tenketsu?"</p><p style="text-align:center;">" I  learnt those techniques to wipe that arrogant smirk of your face," Ryoga spat.</p><p style="text-align:center;">" Ah  yes," Ranma agreed, now facing Ryoga with a crooked smirk. " But why do you  fight me in the first place? Why did you start this feud?   Because of bread? I doubt it. Even you're  not that much of a moron. You fight me for the challenge, to test yourself and  your training. And maybe so you can get into the tomboy's panties."</p><p style="text-align:center;">"  Ranma, you bastard." Ryoga snarled, his hands squeezed into fists.</p><p style="text-align:center;">" You know it's true P-Chan."  She mocked, still smirking.</p><p style="text-align:center;">" So Ranma knows all does he," the  fanged-boy snapped. " Funny it seems, that your great philosophy on martial  arts didn't do you much good to end up in that bed, did it."</p><p style="text-align:center;">" No it didn't," Ranma agreed in a  soft voice, her eyes downcast and her grin gone. " That is why I'm saying what  I'm saying. I now know what martial arts truly is, and the Anything-goes school  with its tricks and schemes doesn't fit the bill." Her voice dropped to whisper  at the end, her eyes now closed, unwilling to look at the world. She seemed  lost desolate, a shadow of the larger-than-life storm that had been Ranma  Saotome.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><i>So now we get to the truth</i>,  Ryoga thought as he watched the girl slump limply on the bed, lacking the will  to hold strength in her muscles. She rolled over, curling up in a foetal ball,  wincing at the pain that shot up her leg and arm. She looked like a lost child,  weak, vulnerable. A person who knew that all was left was to die and rot away.  It was unsettling for Ryoga to his rival like this, so feeble. To see the  person who he had trained for so long, so hard, now broken before him. It  seemed like another rich joke fate had decided to play upon him, to take his  sense of direction, his humanity, and now his focus his reason to fight away  from him. It was all so wretched, that Ryoga could not help but laugh, to  chuckle lightly in bitter humour.</p><p style="text-align:center;">" I guess this is goodbye then  Ranma," he said after a while, hoisting his umbrella upon his shoulder.</p><p>"  Huh?" she muttered raising her head to regard him with wide, blue eyes.</p><p>" I  won't be challenging you anymore Ranma. It's over. You lost." Ryoga sighed.</p><p>"  What!" Ranma screeched, bolting upright, her wounds forgotten in her rage.</p><p>" You have won nothing. We did not fight, and you have  never beaten me." She raged.</p><p>"  True." Ryoga conceded. " But now I don't need to fight you Ranma. I already  know which of us is the better man. Why fight a battle I have already won."</p><p>Turning  around Ryoga opened the door, shafts of light burst in illuminating the room  and making Ranma shy back from the bright.</p><p>"  After all these years, I thought my victory would be sweeter, but seeing you  like this makes me feel nothing but pity." He sighed and shook his head, " So  long Ranma."</p><p>Ryoga  stepped through into the hall and shut the door behind him, closing off the  angry and shocked girl behind him. <i>For you Akane, </i>he said silently. <i>He  will open the door when he's ready.</i></p><p>Ryoga  Hibiki walked through the Tendo halls absently, hoping for the first time in his  life, to get lost.</p>RANMA<p>Ranma  stared towards door Ryoga had just left through. She did not actually see the  door; all her attentions were focussed upon the war between the voices in her  head. The door was just a convenient point for her vacant eyes to fix upon  while the past echoed in her mind. Words, feelings and memories were given form  and shape on the battlefield of her psyche.</p><p>" Ha Ha Ha, You've gotten weak Ranma!" said a figure that  resembled Ryoga, dressed in the same bandana and torn, black shirt. But this  person was different, his fangs huge, yellowed and sharp, threads of saliva  hanging when he spoke. His dark hair was wild and feral, like the hackles of an  angry wolf. The green eyes seemed to glow with a fierce, inhuman light.</p><p>" Your kick felt like the touch of baby's foot," it  snarled.</p><p>Laughter came from the one who faced him. This figure was  a giant. Not in physical size, but in spirit. A Titan. He seemed to glow a  radiant blue as he faced the animalistic doppelganger, with a cocky smirk.  Pride swelled from him, enveloping him, crackling around him like lightning.  Howling gusts of wind whipped around him, his dark braid coiling and writhing  from his head. Ranma thought she knew this man, something about him seemed so  familiar, but also so lost to him.</p><p>" Just 'cause you've gotten a little tougher Ryoga,  doesn't make you invulnerable."  The man  declared, chest swelling.</p><p><i>Such strength, I remember that feeling.</i></p><p>The scene changed then, the background morphing and  fading like ripples across a pond, to a new place, another fight, another day.</p><p>" You will never defeat me again Ranma," yelled the feral  Ryoga-thing as it shot a green bolt of energy at the pig-tailed one. He fought  back with a blast of shining blue; the two flashes stuck each other and  vanished.</p><p>" You should know you can never defeat me by now Ryoga,"  the glowing man mocked.</p><p><i>The rush of adrenalin in my veins. The thrill of the  fight. Riding the razor blade of life at full speed with the wind in my hair.</i></p><p>Once again the world seemed to ripple, blurring  and pulsating. When it cleared the bandana-wearing animal loomed over his foe,  who was crouched on his knees, pushing himself up.He looked no less  amazing, even upon his knees there was still fire in his eyes.</p><p>" I will never concede defeat," he cried. " Never, in any  fight."</p><p><i>Never concede defeat. I was like that. NO. I <b>AM </b></i> <i>like that. I am a warrior.</i> Ranma mind  screamed, and she felt strength flood through her limbs as she gripped her  sheets. <i>I do not bow, I will never bend and I will never break. I will  fight.</i></p><p>Ranma roared like a dragon as she surged with  life, flinging the bedclothes off. She swung, out of bed. Pain lanced through  her wounds, but she did not care. She was awash with determination.</p><p>" I'll show the bastard." She swore. <i>I will never  concede defeat, in any fight.</i></p><p>" Especially to Ryoga Hibiki." She growled<i>, </i>reaching  for her crutches.</p>UKYO<p>The  winter sun hung low in the sky, bright shards of sunlight cut in through the  glass of the windows, dust swilling in their path. The chairs, booths and  tables of the restaurant cast long, harsh shadows across the floor. Sounds and  scents filled the air, the noise of chewing and sizzling combined with the  smoke billowing from the grill and the smell of frying batter.</p><p>Ukyo Kuonji, sighed wiping the sweat and condensed steam  from her brow. This week had been the week from hell. Customers had flocked to  her store in droves. <i>Mental note: Never do any, buy one get another one for  half price offers ever again</i>, she thought with a grimace. It had seemed  such a good idea when she had read of it in her ' <b>How to run a successful  restaurant business</b>,' book that she had purchased from Nabiki. But that  combined with her delicious (even if she says so herself) okonomiyakistarted  a seemingly endless flood of hungry customers. The feeding frenzy was made  worse by the mysterious three day closing of the Nekohanten.</p><p>Ukyo grimaced. That worried her and sent alarms and  claxons ringing in her ears. She just knew that Chinese bitch Shampoo was planning  something, and she just knew that it involved her Ranchan.</p><p>" Excuse me Miss", said one of the customers who sat at  her counter, half way through an Ucchan special. " It's a duck."</p><p>Ukyo smiled apologetically at the man, not even watching  her hands as they flipped over another batter base. " I'm sorry sugar," she  soothed. " I'm afraid we don't serve duck okonomiyaki, perhaps you would prefer  something with seafood."</p><p>The customer blinked, and then cleared his throat. " Uh,  no Miss you misunderstand. Not a duck okonomiyaki, an actual duck." He pointed  at the floor beside his stool.</p><p>" Huh!" she muttered, walking around her grill to see  where the man was indicating. Sure enough there was a duck, waddling about and  bumping between the legs of the man's stool. It emitted a series of angry  quacks and flapped its wings in a huff. The strangest thing was that the bird  seemed to be wearing a miniature pair of bi-focal spectacles.</p><p>" Mousse?" she asked.</p><p>At the sound of his name the transformed Amazon turned  towards her (well vaguely in her direction) and squawked, once again shaking  his wings furiously.</p><p>" QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!"</p><p>Ukyo blew out her breath in irritation. " Yeah, yeah quit  you're quacking. I'll go get the kettle."</p><p>The customer shook his head and returned to his food  trying to ignore the fact that the chef was carrying on a conversation with a  mallard. Living in Nerima people got extremely skilled at ignoring strange  things.</p><p>The young cook returned behind the counter, pausing to  spread a handful of noodles upon one of the Japanese pizzas, and crouched down  to rummage amongst the ingredient cupboards beneath the hob. She extracted a  large brass kettle, shook it to confirm that it was still full, and placed it  on the stove to heat. That done, she took hold of Mousse by his tail feathers,  to stop him from repeatedly walking into a table leg, and carried him into the  back. To have a naked Chinese boy suddenly appear in front of her patrons was  probably bad for business, (well male patrons anyway). Humming nonchalantly,  she went back to the duties of a chef, spreading sauces and frying meat, until  a shrill scream whistled through the air. Grabbing the kettle by the handle she  carried it off behind her and doused the duck with the contents.</p><p>" DAMN THAT'S HOT!" the boy cried as his form rippled,  solidifying into that of a lean, muscular youth with long, dark locks, a pair  of glasses hanging from one ear. Steam still billowed from his damp, reddened  skin as he stretched the kinks from his joints. Then in a blur of motion he  latched onto Ukyo, throwing his arms about her.</p><p>" Oh Shampoo, you've forgiven me." He wept as he squeezed  her tighter.</p><p>Ukyo  began trembling with range, as she balled her hands into fists and ground her  teeth together. Her face reddened in rage and her mouth frothed. Being glomped  by naked and blind perverts was bad enough. But to be mistaken for that tart  was unforgivable.</p><p>" I ain't Shampoo you jackass." She screamed, bashing him  over the head with the kettle still clutched in her hand.</p><p>Mousse gathered himself from the floor, and rubbed at the  rapidly swelling lump on his skull. His mind processed the information, not  Shampoo, female, bad grammar. Only one person it could be.</p><p>" Saotome you wretch," he roared. " How dare you use your  cursed form to impersonate my beloved Jade Princess. And I thought you were  injured. Now you will…"</p><p><b>CLANG</b></p><p>Ukyo chastised him with the kettle once again, gifting  him with another lump.</p><p>" Put your glasses on you blind berk," she snapped.</p><p>He did as she asked, fumbling the spectacles of his ear  on onto his face, pushing them up the bridge of his nose with one finger. Once  placed, he squinted through the huge, distended lenses.</p><p>" Kuonji, what are you doing in the Nekohanten?" He  asked.</p><p>" You're  in my restaurant fool," she sighed, rolling her eyes. In doing so she noticed  another 'small' problem. " And put some clothes on you jerk, this is a family  place."</p><p>With a muffled squeak Mousse made a rushed, clumsy  attempt to cover himself. The skin of his entire body flushed bright red, but  this time not from the heat. Turning his back on Ukyo, he used his Ki to open a  small pouch-like rift, from which pulled a spare set of clothes, which he  promptly threw himself into. Now dressed in his usual attire of black pants,  slippers and the characteristic, patterned, white robes; he spun back around to  apologise to Ukyo.</p><p>" I'm sorry about that and thanks for the water." He said  with a small bow.</p><p>" Your welcome I guess," Ukyo replied slowly calming  down.</p><p>A slow pause hung out, the sound of chopsticks clanking  against plates seemed louder in the silence between them.</p><p>" Yeah, well." Mousse said. " I should really get back to  the restaurant before the rush starts." With a flourish of his robes he turned  and walked out through the front.</p><p>Ukyo started the return to her grill, when she froze  dead. Some of the fumbled, blind words Mousse had said began to sink in.  Lunging into the restaurant she grabbed the tail of myopic, martial artist's  robes, and yanked hard. Mousse spun like a top, whirling around as Ukyo pulled  a spatula from her shirt and pressed the razor sharp edge to the boy's throat.</p><p>" Did you say that Ranma was wounded," she asked him  though gritted teeth.</p><p>Any shock Mousse felt at her sudden wrath and threat was  hidden behind his glasses and icy, cool demeanour. The customers did not even  look up from their food,</p><p>" Yes" he replied.</p><p>" What did you and your purple-haired whore do to him?"</p><p>Mousse eyes sparked through his lenses and he growled the  insult to his beloved.   He raised a  billowing sleeve, and in a flash withdrew a set of knives, fanning them out in  his hands like a set of playing cards.</p><p>" Do not call her a whore," he hissed.</p><p>Ukyo smirked. " Nice tricks with the knives, but it's <b>my</b>  blade at <b>your </b>neck<b>.</b> As skilled as you are I doubt you can do  anything before I cut you." She applied a little more pressure to her spatula.</p><p>" Besides," she continued. " You should want to help me,  neither of us want the two of them together, so we should work together to foil  any plan she and the old ghoul cooked up."</p><p>Mousse seemed to consider this then nodded, as much as he  could with a razor-bladed cooking implement at his carotid artery. With a  metallic scraping sound the daggers in his hand vanished.</p><p>" But he's not hurt because of Shampoo or the old bat,"  he said. " In fact they helped him after his injury, Shampoo was quite upset."  The last part was said in a tone loaded with bitterness.</p><p>" Then what the hell are we fighting for?" She yelled  pushing Mousse away and tucking the spatula back into her shirt. " Now tell me  what happened to Ranchan."</p><p>Mousse told her. Her jaw dropped and her hands trembled.</p><p>" A broken leg," she gasped. Ranma had fought many  battles but had never received such damage. And the wounds he did take he  usually bounced right back from.</p><p>" Who would do such a thing,  even in a duel? That honourless bastard."</p><p>To that Mousse snorted emphatically, and grimaced as if  there was a foul taste in hi mouth. " It was only a sense of honour that kept  Ranma from ending up worse. A man of Loaf's skill could easily have torn Ranma  apart, he only struck with such force because Saotome was too stubborn to know  when he was beaten."</p><p>" You mean Ranma could have been killed." Ukyo said in a  small, weak voice.</p><p>" If Loaf was a more unscrupulous person, then easily."  Mousse said frankly.</p><p>Ukyo shivered, her whole body seemed cold. Icy seemed to  have sunk into her heart, and her chest throbbed with pain. The very though of  Ranma's death was agony to her. It was the theme of nightmares, to have her  light taken from her. Grabbing hold of the nearest spatula she began clanging  it against her grill.</p><p>" EXCUSE ME, DUE TO A PERSONAL EMERGENCY THE UCCHAN IS  CLOSING. YOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED FOR YOUR MEAL. PLEASE EXCEPT MY APOLOGIES, AND  LEAVE IMMEDIATELY."</p><p>The patrons, looked at each other bemusedly wondering why  the place was closing. The lack of movement was far from satisfactory to the  brown-haired girl, who withdrew her large combat spatula and slammed it onto  her counter like a thunder crack.</p><p>" THAT MEANS NOW PEOPLE!" she bellowed.</p><p>The customers bolted from theirs seat and out of the  door, not willing to face the wrath of the spatula-wielding chef.</p><p>" What's with her?" One asked his companion.</p><p>" Dunno must be PMS." The other replied.</p><p>" Ukyo decided she did not have time to kill him just  now, there were more important things to deal with. Ranma. She knew he was  alive, she knew he was going to heal. But that did not matter to her heart. She  just had to see him, had to touch him.</p><p>" You too duck boy," she said to Mousse who nodded and  left. She followed him to the door, locking it behind her. And together they  bounded onto the roof, before vaulting away in different directions. Ukyo  taking the direct route to the Tendo Dojo, jumping from building to building  with trained grace.</p><p>When she arrived she burst through the door, not  bothering to knock, not bothering to wait and be invited in. The yearning to  see Ranma was too great for that. The simply grabbed the handle and tore open  the door, almost barging into Kasumi in her haste.</p><p>" Oh Ukyo, I haven't seen you in a while." The eldest  Tendo girl greeted with a welcoming smile. Which then faded to be replaced with  a stern frown. " You really should've knocked. It wasn't very polite to barge  in."</p><p>A frown from the motherly Kasumi seemed to reduce Ukyo to  a small child, shuffling nervously with guilty, downcast eyes. " I'm sorry  Kasumi." She muttered. " I just had to…" her reason for being there flooded  back to her and she began looking around with darting eyes.</p><p>" Where is he?"</p><p>" Who?" Kasumi asked surprised by Ukyo suddenly wild  expression.</p><p>" Ranma!" she cried.</p><p>Kasumi recoiled at the desperation in Ukyo's voice. Ukyo  saw this and winced herself; taking a hold of her passions she forced herself  to calm down.</p><p>" Please Kasumi, where is he?" she asked softly.</p><p>" Why do you care," asked another more hostile voice.</p><p>Ukyo stared at Akane as she descended the staircase. The  shorthaired girl glared back vehemently through narrowed eyes. She moved to  face down Ukyo, stepping in front of Kasumi to bar the chef's path through the  house.</p><p>" I'm his fiancé," Ukyo responded stubbornly. How dare  Akane ask that of her? The tomboy before her beat Ranma more than Ryoga did, if  Loaf hadn't have injured him Akane would have.</p><p>" Then where have you been? The fight was a week and a  half ago." The other girl jibed.</p><p>Ukyo snarled. The other girl was right. She should have  been there sooner. It should have been her at his bedside not the Chinese  harlot." Well no one was particularly forthcoming with the information." It was  no excuse, but it all she could think of.</p><p>" And it took you until now to realise he was gone. What  tipped you off, the fact he hasn't stuffed his face at your place recently?"  Akane sneered.</p><p>Look un-cute one," Ukyo growled, pulling her combat  spatula from her bandolier. " Are you going to let me see Ranma, or do I have  to force my way through."</p><p>" I don't think that will be necessary." Nodoka cut in,  placing a hand on Akane's shoulder to placate her. The Tendo girl scowled at  Ukyo, but backed off.</p><p>" Auntie Saotome how is he?" Ukyo asked, noticing how  Nodoka winced at the familial reference. <i>If Akane gets to call her Auntie  then so do I, the fat blob engaged me to him to. </i></p><p>" He's being a pig-headed moron," Nodoka said bluntly. "  But physically he's fine. For now."</p><p>" What do you mean ' For now'?" Icy fear wormed into  Ukyo's breast again. Had he been hurt more, than Mousse had said? Was it  serious? Would he be okay?</p><p>Nodoka sniffed in contempt. " The fool has been training  non-stop for the last four days. His leg still hasn't healed; he may end up  damaging beyond repair. His arm is still at risk too, even if it does seem to  be better."</p><p>" Why would he do that?"</p><p>" Because he's a pride-blinded fool!" Nodoka snapped, the  older woman's hands balled into fists, yanking at the fabric of her kimono. "  Ever since that blasted Hibiki boy visited, he's been consumed with training,  probably some macho rivalry thing. Men!" she huffed.</p><p>It seemed to be hypocrisy beyond belief that the woman  who made her son promise under the threat of death to become a man, would  complain about the famous male characteristic; stubbornness. Of course Ukyo did  not mention this, she thought it unwise to anger her future mother-in-law.</p><p>" While his arm  was still injured he spent the day doing one handed push-ups and thrusting his  good arm into fires to pull out chestnuts. God alone knows why?" Nodoka no  longer seemed to be talking to the girls before her; rather she just seemed to  be complaining to the air in the typical manner of an angry mother.</p><p>" Now that his arm has healed he refuses to use his  crutches, spending all day hopping about on the one leg. Says it will improve  his balance."</p><p>" Well at least he's active Auntie," Kasumi interjected,  hoping to calm the Saotome matriarch.</p><p>" Yes, at least he's active." Nodoka agreed. "And this  constant training, is better than his moping and anger."</p><p>Ukyo resisted the urge to gawp or gasp. " Ranma moping?"  she said incredulously. The Ranma she knew did not mope. He was strong, a  person who rolled with life's punches before hitting back, giving as good as he  got.</p><p>" You sound surprised," Nodoka said dryly. " Yes Ranma  moped, sulked like a child. A very disappointing display of his manliness."</p><p>Ukyo heard the doubt in Ranma's mothers voice and leaped  to defend her man.</p><p>" My Ranchan is a true man."  She said proudly.</p><p>The baleful glare that Mother Saotome then rounded on her  made Ukyo want to shrink up and hide in her clothes. She forced herself to  stand tall, despite the chills running down her spine.</p><p>" Who said he was <i>yours</i>?" Nodoka asked in a soft,  steely tone.</p><p>" I'm his fiancé," Ukyo said with a defiant fire in her  brown eyes. " The fat oaf you call a husband saw to that."</p><p>The anger in Nook's eyes only intensified at the mention  of Genma. Her hands were white-knuckled, as she looked ready to tear her kimono  to shreds.</p><p>" The promise to unite with the Tendo family came first,  and takes precedent. Ranma will wed Akane." Mrs Saotome spat.</p><p>In the back of her mind, part of her noticed that she had  heard no words of denial from the Short-haired Tendo girl, and that part was  scared. The rest of her rose up proudly to face the older woman before her, and  would not be cowed.</p><p>" That oath didn't take much of a precedent when Genma  ran off with my dowry." Ukyo strengthened her own glare and fought on, matching  Nodoka's resolve.</p><p>" You will be paid back. I will make sure of it. But  Ranma must marry Akane." The older woman promised, and that promise only made  Ukyo even more furious. She would not just be paid off, as if her emotions  could be bought.</p><p>" I do not want paying." She hissed. " I just want Ranma.  That's all I'll ever want"</p><p>Both Akane and Kasumi gasped at her words, but she barely  heard it. She kept her eyes fixed on Nodoka as the other woman's lips curled  into a mocking smirk, one that reminded of the smile Ranma wore when he fought,  just more sinister.</p><p>" I'm afraid what you want doesn't matter my dear,"  Nodoka said in a voice that dripped with acid.</p><p>Ukyo growled, her grip tightening on her spatula. " Does  what Ranma want matter?" she bit out. " In the end it's his choice."</p><p>Nodoka trembled with rage as she drew herself up. " My  son will do what honour demands!" She roared. But there was a vacancy to her  tone that made Ukyo think that the woman was trying to convince herself more  than Ukyo.  Still seething, Nodoka spun  on her heel and left.</p><p>" Way to get in with the family," Akane said acerbically.</p><p>Ukyo turned to the other girl with a smirk, and a shrug.  " Just had to let her know that I wouldn't give up. In the end it's Ranma's  choice."</p><p>Akane responded with her own smirk, " We'll see," was all  she said before she too left.</p><p>Kasumi  responded with a typical " Oh my," then turned to Ukyo, regarding the chef with  a curiously cocked head.</p><p>" That," she said in awed tone. " Took a lot of courage  Ukyo."</p><p>Ukyo blushed from the praise, once again feeling like a  small child, who had just received a pat on the head by her mother.</p><p>" Thanks," she said sheepishly.</p><p>Kasumi quickly replaced her warm, indifferent smile. "  Ranma's out in the garden," she informed Ukyo. " I'm sure he'd love to see  you."</p><p>Ukyo nodded her thanks before following the young woman  through the house and to the garden. And there he was just as Kasumi had said.</p><p>He was poised on  one leg, the raised limb wrapped in bandage and splint. Yet his posture was  still proud like a peacock, as he boxed with shadows. A thin sheen of sweat  covered his bare chest, drops of moisture spitting from his arms with every  punch he threw into the air. Despite the seasons' chill Ranma wore nothing but  a pair of loose, blue shorts the decorated with a script like pattern. His  raven bangs fluttered in the gusts which occasionally battered his body, but he  was indifferent, his eyes and mind focussed on the imaginary opponent he had  conjured up before him.</p><p>Ukyo paused content to watch him work. Her eyes tracking  every curve and line of his form hungrily, her breath catching as his muscles  bunched with his crosses and uppercuts. Even injured his grace and strength was  a thing of beauty. To Ukyo nothing was as close to perfection as okonomiyaki  and Ranma. <i>Hm, Okonomiyaki sauce and Ranma…!</i> She shook her head to clear  her mind of that line of thought, one part of her brain cunningly storing the  idea for later. As much as she liked to play the voyeur, that was not what she  came for.</p><p>" Heya Ranchan," she greeted with her standard, 'cute  fiancé smile'.</p><p>Ranma glanced over his shoulder for a moment, to identify  her as she approached. His hand form switched as he continued his assault, now  striking with bunched fingers at his shadow-enemy's temples, snarling with  every strike.</p><p>" Hi Ucchan," he said absently.</p><p>" So," she said seeking a thread of conversation. " Back  to training I see."</p><p>" Yeah," he said. " Well couldn't just stand around idle  could I, not that I can stand around easily." He added, his voice tinged with a  bitter tang.</p><p>" Strange," she remarked dryly. " That not what I had heard."</p><p>The speed of his fists slowed momentarily as he sighed,  and grimaced in a mix of annoyance and sheepish abashment. " I see you've  spoken to Akane already," he muttered.</p><p>" I have, but it was your mother who imparted the  information," she admitted, trying to keep the hostility from her voice.</p><p>She knew she had failed when he started, his attack  pattern and stance wavering.  "She's  been a little moody recently," he said. " Mostly because of my big trap. But  please try and get on with her Ucchan."</p><p>" She doesn't make that very easy Ranchan," she replied  indignantly.</p><p>" But please try, for me. It's important that you two get  along." He pleaded, in a soft but warm voice.</p><p>" It's that important to you?" she asked shyly. Her heart  throbbed in her chest so that she could hear the roar of her pulse in her ears.  She looked downwards hastily, pretending to adjust her white sash and hoping  her face was not as red as the warmth of her skin suggested. Her mind spun and  her stomach was queasy as she imagined the reason why he would want his mother  and his fiancé to be friends. Her face grew hotter and she coughed to cover her  rising blush.</p><p>" Of course it's important, I want my mother and my best  friend to get along." He said, naïve as always.</p><p>Ukyo's embarrassed blushes crumpled to a wide-eyed blanch  as if the colour had been drawn from her face. <b>His best friend! </b>She had  walked blindly into that one, setting herself up for the fall. The chef berated  herself mentally for jumping after dreams like a giddy, little girl. She  clenched her teeth as she bit back her annoyance at her blind betrothed. She  glared back up at him, ready to administer some scathing comment. But once she  saw the warm and sincere smile lighting his face, her anger deflated from her  body like the air from a balloon. Damn the man, but he could melt her heart  with a smile.</p><p>" I'll try," she promised sweetly before she knew she had  spoken. <i>Bastard</i>, she mentally swore again.</p><p>" Thanks Ucchan." He said with a smile, and he resumed  his training this time striking with pointed fingers in the snake fist form,  his hands a swift moving blur.</p><p>" Ranma?" She said, after a silence covered them as the  pig-tailed boy disappeared back into his martial arts. The angry snarl  returning to his face, the undisguised fury in his eyes sending chills down  Ukyo's spine.</p><p>He answered with an absent-minded grunt, still absorbed  by his shadow boxing. Ukyo growled in frustration, clenching her fists at her  sides.</p><p>" Damn it Ranma, can you stop flinging punches into the  air so that we can have a sodding conversation." She cried.</p><p>Ranma  paused mid-swing, craning his neck to look over his shoulder with surprised  eyes. He saw the frown of womanly impatience on her face (one that she had  practiced just to make sure that she had all the tricks of the female trade),  and his head cocked to one side, as he seemed to consider something.</p><p>"  Well I guess I can take a short break," he conceded. " But only for a short  while, I gotta train."</p><p>Ranma  bent on his good leg, lowering himself to the grass. He trembled slightly with  effort as more and more of his weight was gradually focussed on the limb. Ukyo  offered a hand to help him down, but he slapped it away with a sneer. She  frowned in anger at his stupidity, but mostly from hurt. Leaning back to brace  himself on his arms as brought his bottom to sit on the ground, growling in  pain as the healed but still tender bones of his forearm strained beneath the  pressure. Once down, he shuffled into a comfortable sitting position, his  injured leg laid out straight in front of him. Ukyo joined him; folding her  legs beneath her and feeling the dew-moist earth give beneath her knees.</p><p>"  C'mon out with it Ranma," she said. " Why the obsessive training, you should be  resting your injury."</p><p>"  Yeah, I'm sure they'd all like that," he growled.</p><p>Ukyo  was shocked by the naked anger in his voice. Cold, hard and deadly like a steel  blade. This was not his usual cocky determination. This was rage bordering on  hate. He was not looking at her, his eyes were staring of into the distance,  but they shone like blue flames, roaring with a fire that built inside him,  ready to erupt.</p><p>" Who  are they?" she finally asked.</p><p>"  Everyone who wants to see me fall. Kuno, Mousse, Herb, <b>Ryoga</b>."</p><p>His  voice was filled with poison as he spat the lost boy's name. Ukyo flinched at  the bitterness of the word. Despite their furious rivalry she knew that Ranma  had never felt any animosity towards the over-emotional youth. In fact Ranma  had even admitted that he respected Ryoga as a martial artist and a friend. Now  she was genuinely scared for her directionless friend.</p><p>"  Calm down Ranma," she said softly. " You're starting to sound paranoid."  Leaning over she placed a comforting hand upon the pigtailed boys shoulder. He  glared at the touching limb, but after a moment she felt the tenseness flood  from him.</p><p>"  This has to do with that duel you had, doesn't it." It was not a question, just  a statement. She already knew the answer. " What did he do to you," she  murmured, barely restraining the urge to take him in her arms and hold him  tight, to brush his hair from his eyes and sooth him like a child, like a  lover.</p><p>" He  did nothing." Ranma replied. " Nothing but show me what true martial arts is.  And treat me like a ignorant novice."</p><p>"  What are you babbling about? You are a true martial artist and no novice  Ranma."</p><p>"  Compared to Loaf I am. When we fought he did so at my level. At first he used  no Ki techniques, no battle aura. He fought me purely hand to hand, and  although I was better in such a fight, he still could have beaten me in an  instant, in his first attack. But no, he fought me on my terms, he gave me a  chance. Do you know how that feels Ukyo? It felt like charity, as if he was  taking pity on me." Ranma voice had faded into a whisper. Ukyo was speechless,  she could not think what to say. There was nothing to be said.</p><p>"  Eventually he had to use his power," Ranma continued. " But I'm sure it was not  even half of what he could do." He paused to sigh. "Loaf even saved me. My leg  was broken, my arm was twisted but I still tried to fight. He knocked me out to  stop be doing myself even greater injury in some stubborn attempt to win. I  heard him apologise to me, right before I blacked out. He said he was sorry."</p><p>In a  sudden burst of self-hating rage, Ranma pounded his fist into the dirt. His  strength made the ground tremble beneath her.</p><p>" So  what if he beat you Ranma, you're young you'll get better." Ukyo soothed,  giving his shoulder a friendly squeeze while yearning to do more.</p><p>"  It's not like that Ucchan." He whispered, just loud enough for her to hear. "  He didn't have three hundred years experience on me. His skill was simply  better than mine. His Art was superior to the Anything-Goes style. The style I  dedicated my life to is nothing more than a bunch of underhanded tricks, for a  true martial artist like Loaf it is less than nothing."</p><p>"  That's bull Ranma," Ukyo replied. " You've fought Saffron and Herb, princes  with great powers, and won. You've beaten Ryoga, Mousse and Kuno countless  times and each a powerful martial artist in his own right. How could you do  that and not be a true martial artist?"</p><p>" Now  you see why I must train," he cried, again punching his fist into the dirt.</p><p>" Every day I lie idle, the others are circling  overhead like vultures, hoping for me to get weak so they can strike. So they  can say they have beaten me." He raised his clenched fist before him staring at  it intently; balling in the fingers so tight the hand trembled. " They won't  beat me, I won't let them. I get better and then I'll take them out."</p><p>"  What do you mean Ranchan?" Ukyo asked in a small voice, scared by the deadly  intensity of Ranma's voice.</p><p>Ranma  looked at her, the blue fire in his eyes roaring in the irises. " If there is  anything I've learnt from this experience it's that I'm a long way from being  the best. In order to become the best I must take no prisoners. I must fight  hard, and fight to win. And I will." His voice hardened like forged iron. " I  will be the best, and I will let nothing stop me from that "</p><p>"  Ranchan," she said softly, trying to calm the raging youth. " Don't you think  that is a cocky presumption. No-one can be the best, perfection is impossible,  anyone who thinks otherwise is ignorant as well as arrogant."</p><p>"  It's a matter of Pride," he proclaimed fiercely. " A matter of honour. And  honour must be defended, no matter the cost."</p><p>Ukyo  watched the flames consume his eyes at those words, and felt an icy fear slide  down her spine at the vow hidden within them. Hastily she jumped to her feet,  not even bothering to brush the grass and dirt from her clothes.</p><p>"  Well R…Ranchan, I've got…a…a restaurant to run so I'll leave you to your  training." Business would be slow for the rest of the day after the way she  threw out her customers earlier, but she needed an excuse. She needed to leave.  There was not another second that she could bare to be around that angry, shell  of Ranma Saotome.</p><p>" But  Ucchan, I thought you wanted to talk?" he said, confusion thick in his tone.</p><p>"  Maybe later, I got to get back." She replied shortly. Turning her back on those  blue eyes, now dulled with bemusement but a moment ago held a deadly almost  sinister light. She left Ranma sitting there, turning her back on him.</p><p><i>That  was not the man I fell in love with. </i>Ukyo declared silently, as her heart  broke and sank to her stomach.</p><p>If only she knew that Akane  and Shampoo had thought the exact same sentiment.</p><p>End Of Chapter 7</p><p><b>AN- </b>Well, I've read your reviews  and can only say thanks for the praise, comments and requests for the story to  continue. Also, I have noticed a lot of comments about Akane tearing at Ranma's  cast. Author falls to his knees and begins Kow-towing to the readers  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You are all completely justified in your views  about that part of the scene, who knows what I was thinking when I wrote that.  Bad beer-monster. Bad, bad beer-monster. I really must have been drunk not to  notice such crappy writing. But what's done is done, all I can hope is to write  rest of the story well enough and make it interesting enough, so that you  forget my little oversight. After all is only one paragraph in f*ck knows how  many. Although it did almost ruin a scene I was otherwise proud of. Unlike this  chapter, which really did not come out as I would have liked, especially  towards the end. Now that I'm at university, I have little time to read  anything but textbooks and equations and that makes my own writing suffer. But  tell me your opinions, particularly on my depiction of Ryoga. I've never  written from his viewpoint or included him but in passing previously, so I'm  anxious to know if I've captured his character. Also my writing of Ukyo.  Although I do not wish to include too much romance or waff in the story (yet),  I feel that their feelings towards Ranma are important factors in how they act,  and I was wondering if this is a good description of Ukyo's emotions. I've  tried to write her feelings as being as strong as Shampoo's but different. Less  lust and desire, but more yearning for his presence and happiness which  manifests itself as friend and confidant role (A kind of Dawson and Joey (for  any DC fans) relationship. Or an early Kenshin and Kaoru. I hope this is an  accurate depiction of Ukyo and her feelings. But as I said I don't want to  stress match-ups too much in this fic, if you want to read more on my  Ranma/Ukyo ideals read my fic ' on my own', which is also on ffnet. Yes I know  that was a shameless plug. So sue me.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Beer-monster. 2002-12-10</p><p>PS- Does anyone know or is willing to be a good  proofreader. After the cast cock-up I should probably have one. Thanks.</p>
