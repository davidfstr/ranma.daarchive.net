</div><p><b>The Mantis Saga,</b></p><p><b>Appendix and Notes</b></p><p>Actually just a way for me to shoot of my big mouth.</p><p>With Beer-monster.</p><p>Okay. So I want to share my ideas, this may seem  awfully arrogant to presume that you care what I think. But here we go anyway.</p><p><b>Acknowledgements:</b></p><p>Okay  credit where credits due. Obviously thanks to Rumiko Takahashi for the obvious.  I owe a lot to evil Nabiki and Shade cause without the New Ranmascan project I  wouldn't have gotten to enjoy this bizarre world. Thanks to Wandering Oni for  agreeing to be my pre-reader and letting me pester him endlessly. Thanks to my  favourite authors for teaching me how to write and such. And finally thanks to  for writing Ranma Vs the World, which inspired this fic.</p><p>I'm not gonna blow sand up your arses and say that the  above was the greatest or best written fic, but it did display martial arts,  and did it well.</p><p><b>Theme: </b>You see the real reason I  like the Ranma series it the way it displays the martial arts, the fighting. I  am obsessed with martial arts and the series has duels and challenges, things  in martial arts history I've always been fascinated in. You may all say, who  cares there are other martial, arts series but Ranma is one of the few that got  the balance right. Take Dragonball, nice series but when the characters have  the power to destroy planets you've gone too far. Fist of the North Star? Too  many exploding heads. Ranma had the mix of duel and techniques with enough  fantasy Ki techniques for interest but no universal damage. My favourite  episodes are the one were he fights tough opponents, Herb, Ryu Kumon, Ryoga and  the Shishi Hokodan.</p><p>Ranma  Vs the World blended Ranma with the only other series that got the balance,  Street Fighter. It had Ranma chasing Ryu to learn a new technique and improve  his skills. The training, fighting and improving fascinates me personally,  maybe cause as a real person in the real world I can't do that. Also all the  great historical masters felt the same way and took trips and fought duels,  Wong Fei Hung, Yip Man etc.</p><p>So I  decided to write a martial arts Ranma fic. I wanted to use Ranma ½ to explore  the martial arts, in a way I haven't seen in fics before. So I came up with the  premise of Ranma and Ryoga travelling the world searching out challenges and  learning techniques. I wanted to show Ranma get stronger and better instead of  having him disappear and then return super-powerful as many have done.</p><p>I  also felt that that sort of things is what Ranma would want to do after all he  loves challenges and can't just wait for people to come to Nerima. But he was  tied to Nerima, by fiancés and school so I had to do something dramatic to make  him feel the need to leave and to improve. Enter Loaf and Nodoka.</p><p>Anyway,  as I wrote this fic I began to think about the virtues important to the master  martial artist in Chinese but especially Japanese and the ideals of the  Samurai. I thought of the past masters Funakoshi, Ueshiba, Choki Motobu, Bruce  Lee and Chan Heung. All very different people but all said to be obsessed with  learning and improving as well as being very honourable people. Honour, that  concept particularly fascinated me, what is it to a Warrior and what is its  place in the modern world. So I really wanted to explore that theme. Honour and  Pride, or two conflicting but essential virtue of the true martial artist, but  I felt that although he means well and is true to his code Ranma's sense of  honour is Miss Guided so by having Nodoka question his beliefs, the narrative  could show how his ideals change as we explore what honour is.</p><p>So  basically there is a point to all this drama, and there are things I'm trying  to do with this fic. One of the main things is originality, something that with  so many Ranma fics out there is running thin. And there is so many  traditionalists out there that they shun all attempts to play with the  characters in new ways or to portray anyone but Akane as other than scenery.</p><p><b>Characters: </b>Well obviously you're a fan  of Ranma otherwise you wouldn't be reading this. In fact why are you anyway,  I'm babbling! The fact is Ranma ½ is a comedy manga; which is quite a shallow  genre. Everything the characters do is geared to slapstick comedy, that's why  hitting your fiancé with a mallet is not considered abuse, why thinking you're  a samurai does not get you locked up, and why Genma has not been arrested for  child cruelty. However this does not create developed characters (yes I said  it, I'm going to get stoned aren't I, and not in the funky, hallucinating way),  except for Ranma and Akane the other figures are cardboard cut outs with swords.  However, if you want to write a well-rounded story you need 3-dimensional  characters, especially if you're a writer like me who likes to get in peoples  heads. So you have to fill in the blanks while still being true to the  character.</p><p>The  way I see it the characters have a general behaviour and a inner behaviour, eg  the general behaviour is the way most people see and portray character, but  sometimes in certain situations in the manga an inner self shows. For example  Ranma's usual attitude to Genma is of anger, but in the Hell's cradle issue we  see he does care for the old git. So for the guy who said I don't read the  manga, I do, and use them to delve deeper into characters. Unfortunately you  can't see all the pieces in the anime and manga, so you have to use your  judgement and try not to let wishful thinking lead you away. Just my little  philosophy on the portrayal of Ranma characters and below is my thoughts and  why I wrote them as I did.</p><p><b>Ranma: </b>I freely admit Ranma is  quite OOC in this fic, but Ranma is a optimistic, happy-go-lucky, confident,  character but the plot of the fic did not really call for that yet. First he  was depressed at the lack of challenge, the at his loss to Loaf, then bitter at  Ryoga's comments, then unsure of himself after the talk with Nodoka, then  guilty at hurting the girls. So not really the Ranma we're used to, but we did  see him return towards the end, and as hopefully the fic will be more  light-hearted and we'll see him some more.</p><p>As I  said Honour and Pride are the two great parts of a martial artists personality.  And for those people who I count as such, these are the two main drives I wrote  for them. Ranma especially. His pride gives him the desire to challenge  himself, to become stronger and better, which also makes him a little arrogant,  but hey he's learning. Honour is really vital to him, it defines his way of  life as a martial artist and always makes him want to do the right thing, but  he doesn't want to hurt anyone thus complicating matters especially where his  fiancés are concerned. But the problem is he's no longer sure what honour is,  and its not really a cast-iron concept so he's a little baffled. He wants to do  the right thing but is not sure what that is. And that's the dilemma.</p><p><b>Ryoga: </b>Well I haven't had much  opportunity to really get into Ryoga's head, but I will write what I think of  him. Ryoga is a nice guy, and he wants to whats right by his own sense of  honour. But his problem is his passion, it run away from him. He always takes  things to extremes, swearing vengeance for a stepped on foot etc, professing  love for a little kindness. But deep down he's just a shy, sensitive guy. I  think he is as proud about his skills as Ranma is but insecure about all else,  he wants challenges and improvement to but thinks such things a petty, so makes  big deals of everything to justify himself. He's also a complete fool where  girls are concerned. His relationship with Ranma is kind of brotherly, they do  have moments when they seem to be good friends but the rivalry between them often  clouds all that and each will always consider the other the benchmark to  measure their skill. A friendlier Goku/Vegeta thing.</p><p><b>Nodoka: </b>Well what's to say.  Tradition and austerity sums it all up. I think of her as a mix of Samurai and  eighteenth century, upper class English gentlewoman. Old fashioned to fault and  obsessed with duty. Duty is the essence of honour but to her it leaves room for  nothing else. She feels that as his mother she knows Ranma's duty better than  he, and will not rest until he fulfils it. She cannot see more outside what she  feels Ranma's obligation to be (ie marry Akane) and thinks that things like  love and free will are just obstacles to what is ultimately for the best: A  shame really because she obviously loves her son very, very much, but happiness  is second to honour. The biggest criticism of my work came at Chapter 8 with  the whole seppuku debacle. Most people seemed to think that Ranma should have  told her where to go and that he was too strong to be cowed by her.  Unfortunately this is where wishful thinking come in to play, and it had often  been the cause of OOCness. We all want Ranma to do that, but the manga shows  that Ranma is quite weak where his mother is concerned. He loves her deeply and  wants nothing more than her approval, he yearns for it. To have her act so  ashamed as she did in that scene is bound to make him react strongly. Or at  least I think so.</p><p>Well  then we come to the fiancés. It gonna get bumpy.</p><p>Unfortunately since Akane is recognised as the true  fiancé most of the other girls are depicted as lifeless cut outs, only to  hassle Ranma until he finally tells them to sod off and marries Akane, which  they do and are soon matched with anyone who comes to pass. It would take a  very good writer a lot of time to write a convincing reason why Mousse and  Shampoo would end up together. But these characters are people with feelings,  so I wanted to get inside them and rumble about.</p><p><b>Shampoo: </b>Okay first, she's not a  bimbo. There have been several indications, which show she has a brain not  least her imaginative schemes. But like Ryoga she is very passionate and lets  her heart rule her head most of the time. And her heart wants Ranma.</p><p>It would be easy for Shampoo to fall for someone like  Ranma. Surrounded by men who cower around women ands think the best way to woo  her is to try and beat her up, a man with Ranma's spirit and skill is very  attractive to someone like Shampoo. Also Ranma's battle prowess probably  arouses her quite a lot as I hinted at. However her culture is different and I  tried to show that. First it is obvious in the manga and anime she has no  qualms about sexuality, in ancient myths Amazons were quite highly sexed and  such things were quite open. So her physical desire for Ranma is quite  undeniable. However her culture has made her quite happy with showing this but  her emotional desires are something different, It si quite easy to imagine in a  society where women marry men for breeding quality and strength, sex would be  quite open but romance would be next to non-existent. Real love is something  their culture knows little of so when the depth of her feelings for Ranma  become known to her, she is blown away and had no idea what to do with such  feelings or how to express them, thus we fall back on the physical because she  understands that. Honour and pride are important to her as an Amazon warrior,  but not in the same way. Although I'm sure she would enjoy competition and  rivalry as much Ranma, that's why she was the village's champion, her sense of  honour is different. Her beliefs mostly focussed on strengthening the tribe, by  any means, it is her first loyalty and the reason behind some quite  reprehensible antics. But her love for Ranma could never be doubted. Shampoo is  a great example of culture clashes, and makes her quite interesting.</p><p><b>Ukyo: </b>The Joey to Ranma's Dawson,  the classic best friend romance, which is one of my favourite plot lines.  Anyway, Ukyo strikes me as opposite to Shampoo in a way: as she never hides how  much she cares for Ranma, but more physical urges are embarrassing to her, as  does having to say those three words that Shampoo says all the time. She is  more quiet and slow with Ranma, knowing that she'll always be a good friend  until he finally picks her. She is more a case of quiet yearning, a dreamer,  she'll work in her restaurant serve the people and fantasise about her  pigtailed knight. But in the real world she is his friend before fiancé and  uses that position to gradually bring him around to her side with more subtle  means.</p><p><b>Akane: </b>The default Ranma girl.  There are two main portrayals of who most consider the true fiancé, strangely  these correspond to the two camps of Ranma fans. From the Akane lovers, the  sweet, innocent but independent girl who is just misunderstood and a soon as  Ranma admits his love they'll skip hand in hand to the sunset. What crap! The  other ideal is that Akane is really a bitter, recriminating cruel bitch who  hates Ranma and rejoices in making his life miserable. Okay so the female lead  of Ranma 1/2 is in fact Atilla the Hun, not likely. Akane is by no means  perfect, but she's not a monster. I see her as a mess of contradictions. On the  outside she is strong and independent, stubborn who always tries to help but  takes no crap. But on the inside she's a scared, little girl. Tough but  vulnerable, brave but frightened, confident but insecure: that's Akane. Those  who don't believe me, think of the movies, she acted all strong by slapping  Kirin and dumping the pickles, but when he became interested she just sat and  pined for Ranma. A contradiction.</p><p>As for Ranma I think at the start she did not like  Ranma, but as she got to know him she fell for him. A classic Pride and  Prejudice romance, a novel which instilled the idea that is two people act like  they hate each other, they must love each other. Nope! Akane still treats Ranma  with such anger, is that she's scared of her feelings and the distrusting and  violent routine is a safe and familiar haven. It took Ranma's leaving to make  her break the cycle, but will it stay broken? I'll just say that for a A/R  relationship to work it would take a lot of work and a lot of time to develop  trust and respect, cause sometimes love ain't enough. A challenge for any  author, and I like challenges (is that a hint or am I trying to throw you off  guard.)</p><p>Something  I want in this story is to keep the reader guessing who Ranma will end up with,  until I start the true romance and spring the answer.</p><p><b>Martial arts: </b>For those of you who are  familiar with the martial arts I thought I would just outline the one's to be  used primarily. Ranma's style will mostly be a mix of Japanese arts, Karate and  Jiu-jitsu, with some elements of Wing Chun and Tai Chi. A style that mostly  focuses on speed and technique. Ryoga by contrast is more about power and  strength. His style will be a huge mix of various international styles to  reflect his wandering. These will include Southern style of Kung Fu, Hung Gar  and Tiger Claw, also Choy Lay Fut, Muay That and various forms or wrestling  such as Greco-Roman, Pancrase and Submission. The other characters I'm not sure  of yet, but Shampoo will probably have White Crane Kung Fu mixed with Eagle  Claw, and Ukyo a style based on the Japanese halberd art Naginata-jitsu with  some Ninja style use of weapons.</p><p>Well  that's it I babbled, shared my thought and mostly dissed and analysed the crap  out of the Ranma fanfic genre. I probably offended a lot of people, but get  used to it. Well I'm of to get a cup of tea, a beer and then hit the hay.  Nighty-night.</p>
