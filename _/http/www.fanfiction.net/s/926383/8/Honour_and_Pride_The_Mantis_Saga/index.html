</div>                Honour And Pride    By Beer-Monster         Book I: The Mantis Saga              Chapter Eight: Warrior Path              Meagre light filled the grey sky. It strayed in  through the window, only to be blocked by the heavy curtains. The light tried  to stream around the thick fabric, but the dark clouds weakened the suns rays,  so that the light could only form a formless halo around the sill. The room was  shrouded in a dark, hazy, gloom. The two shapes spread across the floor were  barely distinguishable as human in the dampened brightness. Well one could be  recognised as human, the other a huge, round blob. Its bulk pulsated with the  rhythmic sound of guttural snoring. The pattern of black and white fur was  barely visible, revealing the figure to be a panda.                Ranma Saotome's eyes'  twitched as his mind fought its way into wakefulness. His breathing sped up as  his body prepared to rise with the new day. His fingers moved with life as his  muscles flexed. His eyes finally slid open, the dark pupils widened, then  narrowed before widening again as his mind adjusted his vision to the  surroundings. His lungs filled with air as he rose upright, only to exhale as  he yawned loudly. He circled and stretched his arms, flexing the muscles to  remove the kinks and knots incurred during sleep. Working his mouth to moisten  dry lips, he awoke fully.                Whipping of the bed sheets  he looked at the bandages wound his lower leg. Experimentally, he tensed the  muscles around the wound. Small twinges of pain answered his tests, but not the  searing agony he had before. Ranma had done for the least two mornings, ever  since Kasumi had informed him that Cologne felt that her salve had healed the  wound enough for him to walk. And walk he did, and run, and jump. Revelling in  his reset bones. The limb was still tender, and there was a certain lumbering  stiffness in his walk instead of the usual fluid grace, but he could walk, and  he could fight.                Stretching his arms out  once again Ranma gathered himself to his feet, the twinges intensifying but  bearable. He then turned to the still slumbering Panda, and kicked it in the  ribs. The panda did not even grunt. Ranma repeated the procedure another five  times. Finally the bear rolled over, throwing a sign at Ranma's head like a  bullet.    [Go away, boy!]    Ranma caught the sign effortless and brought it  crashing down on his father's thick panda skull.                " Get up old man, it's  time to spar."                [We can't boy.] The new  sign said. [You're supposed to be resting your leg.]                " My leg's fine," Ranma  snorted with a dismissive gesture. " Besides I could kick your ass with no  legs." He boasted, and then paused after noticing the lack of logic in that  statement.                [Your mother would kill  me] Genma protested.                " And I'll kill you if you  don't get your lazy, furry butt out of bed and meet me down stairs in ten minutes.  I'm even generous enough to let you change back into a fat, bald git." Ranma  punctuated his speech with another kick to his father's furry hide.                 [Fine, but you're  explaining it to your mother.] Genma signed as he began to lumber up onto his  paws. Using one claw scratching at his large stomach as he waddled of to find a  kettle.                Ranma smirked, and  proceeded into the bathroom to quickly wash his face and brush his teeth,  before shrugging on one of his standard long-sleeved, Chinese shirts and black  pants. Rolling his sleeves midway up his forearm, he descended the stairs.                " Good morning Ranma,"  Kasumi greeted warmly, as he entered the kitchen.                He only grunted in  response, noticing the kettle poised over a hot stove. <i>So the old man isn't  going to chicken out on this one. Good. </i> His father was nowhere near the level of competition he craved,  but it would do. And he would not go easy on him either. <i>The old man won't  know what hit him. </i>Which of course would be Ranma's fist. He remembered the  times on the road with his dad. The training, the constant sparring, how Genma  would taunt young Ranma when he lost. How he always said that Ranma was not a  true man. How he fought for and stole his own son's food. Ranma growled as he  marched into the back yard. His father was another one who loved to see Ranma  fail, was jealous of his talent. The hell's cradle proved that. He cracked his  knuckles repeating his vow not to concede defeat to anyone. Not even to his own  flesh and blood.<p>Ranma had began a  small warm up, jogging on the spot and stretching, pulling his arms across his  body to loosen the muscles, as he saw his father approach. Genma was adjusting  the white bandana he used to cover his bald, head with one hand as he pushed  his spectacles further up his broad, broken nose with the other. He was dressed  in the usual grime covered, white gi that never seemed to get washed. Ranma  watched him impassively, maintaining a slightly aggressive poker face to  confuse his opponent. Genma did not seem to buy it as he took up a position  across from his son, with barely two paces between them.</p><p>" We don't have time  for this boy." He grunted. " Your mother and Kasumi will have breakfast ready  shortly."</p><p>" Don't worry pop,"  Ranma replied, eyes locking with his father's. " It never takes me long to beat  you down."</p><p>" Show some respect  brat! I am still your sensei." Genma snapped. Taking up a sturdy fighting  stance.</p><p>Ranma smiled, but it  held no humour or even arrogance, just ice. " Oh don't think I've  forgotten that." He said in acidic tones. He answered the elder Saotome's  posture with a neutral stance, arms hanging low and legs casually spaced as if  walking.</p><p>" <i>Shinzentai  Kamai</i>?" The older man murmured. " Let's see what else you remember boy!"  Genma attacked.</p><p>Ranma  casually sidestepped the flying kick, letting his father's foot pass over his  shoulder. " Too obvious," he commented dryly, before slamming his open palm  into the airborne man's chest. Genma spun with the blow, landing easily on his  feet, just in time to block Ranma's roundhouse kick. The boy's left hand came  chopping down onto his father's neck before his other leg caught the jaw with  his knee.</p><p>Genma  reeled with the impact, and with agility that defied his bulk moved into a  backwards, rolling break fall. Once on his feet he charged at his son with a  series of jabs, to test Ranma's defence. He found it impeccable as his son  batted his fists aside with one hand. In a bold move, Genma rolled his hand as  Ranma parried. Stealing the energy to whip a backhanded slap across the punk's  expressionless face. Caught by surprise, Ranma staggered, more from shock than  from the impact. Genma pressed his momentary advantage to lunge a cross at  Ranma's chest.</p><p>He  was more than surprised when Ranma caught the fist with his lead, and thrust  his rear hand into the large man's ribs. Genma gasped as air fled his lungs.  Without the added blubber of his panda form Ranma's knuckles were sorely felt  in his side.</p><p>But  the youth held on to Saotome's hand, yanking the larger man forwards and pivoting  on his heel. Genma was pulled roughly onto the point of Ranma's elbow,  expelling more air from him. Then his son wrapped his free arm over Genma's  captured limb, seizing his gi to provide leverage he flipped the heavyset,  martial artist over his shoulder.</p><p>With  the years of trained reflex that lay beneath his belt, Genma controlled his  decent so that he landed on his feet in a crouch. Acting quickly he aimed a  fast donkey-style back kick at Ranma. The boy barely had enough time to brace  himself and raise crossed arms to take the kick. Ranma stumbled back a little,  parting from his father as the older man spun to face him.</p><p>Genma  Saotome watched his son warily. Looking for any hint of emotion in those azure  eyes. The cocky bravado the youth usually presented when he fought was gone.  Replaced with a steel-cold impassive glare and rock like frown. And that  worried Genma greatly. His side blazed where Ranma had punched him in the ribs,  now severely bruised and nearly broken. That shoulder throw had also been  performed with no restraint, aimed at viciously slamming his opponent into the  ground. If he did not better, he would have thought his son was really trying  to hurt him.</p><p>Ranma  tensed suddenly, then leapt forward. Thrusting his foot at the large man in the  gi, as if to punch his foot through the expansive stomach. Genma desperately  tried to deflect the kick, and managed to knock the leg from its path. But the  force behind Ranma's charge was too great; it smothered Genma as an elbow  crashed into his cheek. Stars flashed across the bald man's vision as Ranma  again grasped two handfuls of the dirty gi. Falling to the ground the boy  landed on his back and pulled his father with him, planting the heel of his  left shoe into Genma's belly and using it like a catapult to launch the bulky  martial artist into the Koi pond.</p><p>The  panda sat up in the water, spitting out a small puddle and shaking a fine spray  from his fur. Genma berated himself for failing to avoid such an obvious  technique, all the while afraid for his son's change in demeanour and sudden  aggression.</p><p>"  Ranma! Mr Saotome! Breakfast is ready." Kasumi called from the house.</p><p>Genma's  fears fled at the thought of food.</p><p>"  Saved by the food old man," he heard Ranma sneer, in a voice that had raised an  octave. The panda noticed his son had now become his daughter. Her skin  glistened damply as she wrung her red pigtail free of water. The boy had  apparently been caught by the small tsunami that had occurred on Genma's entry  to the pond.</p><p>"  Make sure you shake that fur of yours dry before coming in, we don't want to  leave any extra mass for Kasumi now do we." Ranma said with a lofty smirk, as  she walked back to the house, flapping her pants and shirt to remove any excess  water. She shivered slightly, the chill air and cold water freezing her skin.  She noticed herself limping slightly, the cold aggravating her wound.</p><p>"  That was an energetic spar Ranma," Kasumi said as she laid the dishes on the  table. Ranma slid the shogi door behind her and shrugged.</p><p>" Old man deserved what he  got," she said simply as she sat at the table, between his mother and Akane,  who sullenly shuffled over sullenly, sparing him a sharp glare. He ignored it  and began inhaling his food with relish.</p><p>" Would you like me to get  you a kettle," Kasumi asked.</p><p>" Yeah, could you." She  replied without looking, ignoring his mother's terse frown at his lack of  manners.</p><p>" You should be resting your  leg Ranma, it hasn't healed fully yet." Nodoka said. " Don't you think so  Akane?"</p><p>" Humph." The shorthaired  girl snorted, the angrily expelled air ruffling her raven bangs. " It's the  jerks own stupid fault if he injures himself again."</p><p>Ranma could not help but  feel an amused satisfaction as he watched his mother grimace, obviously  disappointed at not getting the sweet, concerned answer she had expected from  the youngest Tendo girl. <i>Shows how little she knows the tomboy</i>, he  thought as he turned to his fiancé.</p><p>" Such tender concern Akane,  I'm touched." He said dryly, putting a mocking hand over his heart to increase  his sarcasm. Then in acid tones he spat " Should have known you wouldn't give a  damn."</p><p>A hurt look passed across  her face and shone in the watery blue of her eyes. Ranma saw it, and for a  moment a small pang of guilt twanged in his chest. But it disappeared as Akane  covered her emotions by poking her tongue out.</p><p>" Who would care about a  jerk like you? And if you're so perfectly healed, why don't you come to  school."</p><p>" Akane does have a point  Ranma." Nodoka agreed. " I you are well enough, you should return to school.  There is no reason for you to reject your studies."</p><p>" No reason except to waste  my time," Ranma said shortly, avoiding his mother's disapproving glare by  focussing on Akane's. That one he could deal with. " What I should be doing is  what I am doing. Training. My injury left me idle for too long and I need to  keep my skills sharp, like a blade. Isn't that right Pop?"</p><p>Ranma did not look at his  father, but had heard the heavy, lumbering steps and the soft sliding of the  shogi door. The panda growled in response as he made his way to the table,  managing to squeeze its bulk between his wife and Soun. Ranma fought down the  smirk that tried to crawl across his lips as he saw the bear cradling its side,  nursing the bruised ribs.</p><p>" It's good that you are  showing such resolve son." Soun said mildly. " But don't you think you're  overdoing it."</p><p>Ranma's eyebrow rose as he  turned to the moustached man, eyes glinting with dry amusement. " And I suppose  I should be sitting on my arse, and playing Go." He said with scathing  acerbity.</p><p>" Ranma!" Nodoka screamed in  incensed outrage. " That is going to far. Apologise to Soun. Right this…"</p><p>The pig-tailed youth threw  up a hand to forestall her protests. He cocked his head, so that he appeared to  be listening to something distant. What he was truly doing was sensing. The  hairs on the backs of his necks stood on end, and his instinct rang bells in  his ears. The corner of his lips curled in a sly, fiendish smile of  anticipation.</p><p>" Someone's coming." He said  simply. He did not know who, but he could guess what they wanted. <i>Good. The  old man wasn't much of a warm up.</i></p><p>" Who is it?" Akane asked her tone a mixture of  incredulous disbelief and envy at his abilities.</p><p>" SAOTOME YOU CUR! THY DAY  HATH COME."</p><p>The eloquent and  melodramatic cry was all the answer the shorthaired, or anyone at the table,  required. Only one person was deluded enough to use such archaic speech, well  actually to but only one who spoke with a male voice.</p><p>" Kuno," Akane sighed.  Characteristically stating the obvious.</p><p>Ranma sighed also, but in  disappointment. Kuno was not who he had hoped for. Her sights were still set  upon making a yellow and black bandana drip red. But beggars could not be  choosers, and he would have to deal with the sword-happy nutcase eventually.  Might as well get it over with sooner.</p><p>" Kuno?" He heard his mother  murmur thoughtfully. " That name seems familiar."</p><p>"  He's one of Ranma's rivals." Akane said, staring daggers at the pigtailed boy.</p><p>"  That's not very specific Akane dear. Ranma has so many." Nodoka responded,  adding her own glare at her son. "Is he the one with the glasses?"</p><p>[No  dear, that's Mousse] Genma signed.</p><p>"  Kuno carries a sword Auntie." Kasumi supplied helpfully</p><p>" A  sword. Wasn't he one of the one's who barged in so rudely on Akane and Ranma's  wedding. If I'm not mistaken he seemed quite enamoured with you Akane."</p><p>Akane  nodded, her eyes downcast as she refused to meet Nodoka's inquiring eyes. Ranma  could not blame the girl; she too stared intently at her food, suddenly  fascinated at the way her chopsticks made tracks in the rice. The wedding was  something she would rather not remember. However fate was ironic, and instead  made the event something that she would never forget.</p><p>" Is  that why he wishes to fight with you Ranma?" His mother asked.</p><p>"  That and the fact that he's a deluded jerk, yes."</p><p>Speak  of the deluded jerk and he shall appear. A tall, gaunt youth barged into the  room, holding a curved wooded blade aloft as he charges. His brows were drawn  together into a raging frown beneath his dark curls. His teeth were born in an  angry growl.</p><p>" The  time for divine justice is at hand Foul Sorcerer." He yelled, as he charged  forward. Then came to a screeching halt, legs flailing as he tried to recover  his balance. He failed and collapsed face first into the hardwood floor.</p><p>"  Deluded, you say?" Nodoka said regarding the sprawled Kendoka.</p><p>Kuno's  head popped up, his wide eyes scanning the room. Then he bolted into action.  Nodoka gasped and ducked, prepared for the deadly sword strike that she knew  would be streaking towards her son's heart. Instead she was more surprised and  sickened as the tall youth attached his self to Ranma's glomping strongly.</p><p>" My  pig-tailed goddess, no doubt you have yearned for me." Kuno gushed.</p><p>" Get  offa me you moron." Elbowing Kuno's head with enough force to send him  barrelling backwards.</p><p>" I  thought he had come to challenge you Ranma," Nodoka said softly, one hand  fingering the bound hilt of her katana. " Care to explain why a man is hugging  you?"</p><p>"  Because he's a perverted jerk, and he won't except I'm a man." Ranma spat.</p><p>" He  doesn't know about the curse Auntie." Akane explained. " We've tried telling  him. But he's so stupid that…" Akane was cut of as the revived Kuno threw his  arms around her.</p><p>"  Akane Tendo my beautiful Tigress," He said embracing her tightly. The Tendo  heir punched him back across the room so that he slammed into the opposite  wall.</p><p>"  Ranma Saotome, why did you not defend your fiancé?" Soun roared.</p><p>Once  again Kuno's head rose at the sound of his adversaries name. Jumping to his  feet he struck a ridiculous pose, bokken pointing skyward, as he stood proud  with his hand on his hip, looking determinately at the ceiling.</p><p>" Yes  Ranma Saotome. I hath come to free my two beloveds from the grasp of his black  magic. Now that he has healed from his injuries, I shalt smite him. "</p><p>" His  injuries." Akane asked, wondering how Kuno had heard of Ranma's loss.</p><p>"  Yes. I hath learned of the sorcerer's defeat. However the man was obviously of  an ignorant lower caste as he did not complete the deed. However I the Blue  Thunder of the noble house of Kuno, shall not fail in my divine mission to rid  the world of Ranma and his machinations."</p><p>The  occupants of the Tendo house had long since tuned out the rambling twit's  speech. All except Nodoka who did not know Kuno well enough to be so prepared,  and so listened to the idiotic babble.</p><p>" So  you are here to challenge the Saotome School?" She summarised eventually.</p><p>"  Yes, that is correct. Although I did wait until now, as it would be  dishonourable to attack an enemy when he is wounded, even one as low as  Saotome. But it appears as if the cur has fled rather than face my wrath." Kuno  answered.</p><p>" And  it is honourable to lust after two girls, and blame your defeat on sorcerers  magic." Ranma muttered bitterly.</p><p>Kuno  however had not heard Ranma's jibes as his attention was focussed upon the  kimono-clad woman kneeling at the Tendo family table.</p><p>"  Hello Madam. I am Tatewaki Kuno, The Blue Thunder of Furinkan high. I do not  recognise your visage, are you perhaps related to my fiery love Akane. Or hath  the vile Saotome bewitched you into joining his Sorcerer's harem."</p><p>Ranma  barely withheld the urge to throw up, but the thought of her mother in a harem,  particularly her, still sent shivering convulsions through her spine. The level  of stupidity and perverseness that Kuno exhibited had shot up in Ranma's  opinion. His own mother. Brrr.</p><p>"  Let's get this challenge rolling." She said, and raised a hand to slap back  Kuno's attempted glomp.</p><p>" So  you shall cheer for me as I smite the wicked one, my pigtailed beauty." He  said.</p><p>Ranma  heaved out an exasperated sigh. " Kasumi is the tea ready?" she asked. The  older girl nodded, and rose from her seat. " No I'll get it," Ranma said as he  stood up.</p><p>" Ah,  My Goddess, You wish to prove your love for me in a romantic tea ceremony. I  except." The swordsman said softly, hand clasped over his heart.</p><p>" No  I'm just going to get Ranma, Sempai." She said with all the fake, girly  sweetness she could muster. " And then he's going to beat you head into a  pulp." She added beneath her breath as she entered the kitchen. Grabbing the  kettle that had been prepared earlier, she upended the contents over herself.  Her body seemed to melt as the hot liquid washed over her. The curves of her  form flattened out and hardened into firm muscle. The hair darkened to midnight  black, as water dripped from the pigtail and steam billowed around his now male  figure.</p><p>He  brushed the water from his shirt, fine droplets skimming from his fingers and  they ran across the wet silk. Satisfied he strode purposefully back into the  dining room. In predictable Kuno fashion, the tall boy jumped to his feet from  where he was kneeled trying to hug Akane.</p><p>" So  Saotome you show your foul visage."</p><p>Ranma  grimaced. The nut ball may get away with calling him a sorcerer, an enemy of  women. But no one called him ugly. Especially someone who looked like Kuno did.  Hell even Ryoga was good-looking compared to that clod. He brought his hands  together and cracked his knuckles. The sound resounded through the room like  roar of thunder. He could not stop his lip curling up in dark, anticipation. He  was going to enjoy this.</p><p>" And  you are dressed in the same clothes as my pig-tailed beauty. You foul pervert."  Kuno charged, his battle cry covering Ranma's furious snarl. Pervert! He hated  that word. He had heard it so often since he had been cursed, and it never  failed to set fires of rage flaring.</p><p>Dodging  Kuno's so obvious downwards slash, his hand flashed out, gripping the Kendoka's  stiff neck. Ranma applied just enough pressure to make breathing difficult, yet  feeling a giddy power knowing he could shut the pompous windbag up permanently  with just a squeeze. He could almost hear the snap.</p><p>"  Stop it Kuno, this is not the place to fight." Ranma said sternly.</p><p>"  So…you refuse to face the…the Blue Th..Thunder." Kuno wheezed around the  fingers on his windpipe. " You…Coward!"</p><p>Ranma's  smirk grew. There was no humour in the smile, but a deadly coldness, a frozen  steel blade, blue glints along its surface shining in his eyes. It was the kind  of smile that Charon greets the dead with, as he stretches out a pale hand to  demand his fare to ferry the lost souls into hell The promise of pain held in  Ranma's grin permeated even Kuno's deluded mind.</p><p>" I never said I wouldn't  fight you." Ranma chuckled, a bitter sound full of sinister amusement. " I just  said this isn't the place. You wouldn't want to wreck you beloved Akane's house  now would you?"</p><p>Kuno twisted and writhed in  the pigtailed boy's grip, raging at Ranma's obvious amusement, furious at how  the demon dared to laugh, as if he did not know that Tatewaki Kuno would smite  him down with divine power. But Ranma' grip was iron as he turned to the eldest  Tendo sister.</p><p>" Kasumi if you would  please." He said, his voice polite but still ice.</p><p>The brown-haired girl  nodded, her eyes wide, her body stiff with fright as she rose from where she  sat. Moving slowly, so slowly, yet as fat as her shocked body would permit she  moved over to the shogi doors, and slid them open wide.</p><p>" Thank you Kasumi," Ranma  said, then with a sudden twist of his body, he pitched the Samurai wannabe  through the opening like a baseball. Kuno sailed across the room and into the  garden. Ranma followed, sauntering casually with his hands in his pockets  through Kuno's trajectory. The swordsman landed in an undignified heap on the  floor, and slowly pulled himself up to his feet, pushing on his bokken for  support.  Ranma moved across to face  him, once again standing in the neutral posture he had used when fighting his  father. He smiled cockily in the face of Kuno's red, rage-flustered face.</p><p>" You shall pay for your  insolence!" Kuno screamed, as he stormed forwards, sword drawn back at the  ready. Ranma sighed and wondered why everyone had to yell something at the tops  of their lungs when they attacked.</p><p>The wooden blade whistled  shrilly as it cut the air again and again. A storm of swords strikes was  unleashed from Kuno, who brought them to bear on his nemesis. Ranma kept on  smiling as he slipped between the strikes at if they were nothing. Fierce gusts  were summoned by Kuno's sword as it churned the air, causing leaves and grass  to spin in the foul winds. Ranma acted as if it was a pleasant breeze.</p><p>Then clapping his hands  together before him, he caught the bokkens edge between his palms mid-swing. He  took the time to shake his head at the taller youth, and tut mockingly with a  click of his tongue. He pushed the blade from out of his past as he sent his  fist crashing into Kuno's jaw.</p><p>Kuno staggered back,  blinking as lights flashed in his vision. Ranma stood there, grinning inanely.  The samurai's hand gripped the wooden handle of his weapon in white-knuckled  hands, feeling the hardness of the oak bit into his palm as he fought down the  urge to rub at his stinging chin, refusing to show pain. There was no poetic  threat or invocation of godly favour as he charged Ranma once again. Just a  wordless snarl, as he bolted forwards, sword raised high.</p><p>Thrusting  his hands out, Ranma grasped Kuno's arms as they descended. Spinning around, he  drew the Kendoka around him, and over an outstretched leg. He was flipped over  as Ranma's thigh barred his legs. Swept up and tossed like a leaf in a mountain  storm.</p><p>The  collision of the swordsman's body against him sent a hot shot of pain down his  leg as his newly healed bone was jarred in the impact. Ranma grunted and  released his annoyance by putting a fierce foot to Kuno's ribs after the older  boy slammed into the grass. Kuno grunted, rolling slightly onto his side as his  free arm hugged the offended flank.</p><p>Ranma  stood by his foe's head and dropped to his knee's, bending forwards and  bringing his face closer to Kuno. He stared intensely into the other youth's  hazel eyes, his nose now a fingers width from his opponent's mildly perspiring  forehead.  He felt a happy quirk as he  saw glimmer of fear permeate the fog of delusion.</p><p>" Aww  poor Kuno-baby." He said in a deep baby voice as he borrowed Nabiki's patronising  nickname for the idiot. " Did you fall over? How clumsy."</p><p>His  smiled widened as he heard Kuno growl with almost insane rage, spittle frothing  around his clenched teeth. Ranma hopped back as a bokken cut the air where he  had stood.</p><p>"  Missed me. Missed me." He chanted.</p><p>Roaring  Kuno pushed himself to his feet and leapt at the mocking martial artist. Then  his primal scream was reduced to a weak gasp as he found Ranma's foot thrust  into his path. He bent almost double as the impact of the side kick hit his gut  like a cannonball, his feet rose from the floor and his torso crumpled around  the slipper-clad piston. Saliva flew from his mouth as the air was driven from  his lungs. Kuno slumped to his knees. His mind swam as he gasped, lungs pumping  to regain his lost.</p><p>"  C'mon Upperclassman. Where is that aristocratic pride of yours? It really  doesn't seem like you're even trying." Ranma jeered, and with a sneer  backhanded Kuno across the face brutally, knocking the swordsman face first  into the dirt.</p><p>" Not  giving up, are you bokken-boy?" Ranma said with a smile as he stepped back to  allow Kuno to stand.</p><p>" How  dare you mock me cur." Tatewaki spat.</p><p>" You  make it so easy to do I can't resist."</p><p>The wooden blade sang as Kuno brought it  swinging upwards in a rising slash as Ranma's groin. The pigtailed boy kicked  it aside with the side of his foot, before whipping his heel across the  upperclassman's face. Staggering back from the blow, Kuno shook his head to  clear his sight of stars before lunging at the man in the scarlet shirt. He  braced his bokken in both hands point first, aiming to skewer Ranma through the  belly. But with a fluid grace Ranma seemed to writhe around the blade's point,  sliding to the Kendoka's flank, where he unleashed a crushing knee to the  kidneys.</p><p>The  boy stumbled forwards as the impact slammed into him, pain exploding around the  attacked organ. His torso was knocked away faster than he legs could scrabble  to keep up, and he began to topple over. Yet he stopped, his descent halting with  a jarring abruptness.</p><p>Ranma  yanked on the handhold he had acquired on the back of Kuno's gi. Twisting the  material in his grip as he pulled the taller boy forcefully back to him. The  braided fighter thrust his fist into the already near pulverised kidneys. Kuno  roared in agony, spinning in Ranma's grip to remove the injured side from his  range. But that move brought him even further off balance, and the Saotome heir  found it easy to pull him down, forcing him to bend over at his waist.</p><p>Ranma  brought his knee slamming into Kuno's face, feeling a swell of satisfaction as  he heard the nasal bones break with a wet snap. Blood spurted from the impact  like the innards of a burst tomato. The swordsman fell backwards, tipping  stiffly over like a felled tree. Hand's flashing out he snatched the bokken  from his opponent's weak grip as he fell.   He waved it about and flipped it his hands, as Tatewaki rolled on the  floor, hands covering his face in an attempt to stop the blood flow. Eventually  the pain and fluid loss was overwhelming and the older boy stilled as he sank  into unconsciousness.</p><p>"  Whose visage is foul now pretty boy?" Ranma could not help but say in a voice  loaded with spite. After a nonchalant shrug, he flung the captured bokken off  into the distance. But turned to find another sword levelled at his throat, and  this one was made a sharpened, glimmering steel.</p><p>"  RANMA SAOTOME." His mother shrieked, her face glowing a bright red as rage  suffused her being. " THAT WAS THE MOST WRETCHED THING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED."</p><p>Faced  with such scorn and disgust in the cerulean eyes that had been absent from his  life for so long, the adrenalin and battle high that Ranma's had been exalting  in fled his body as if drained from him. He blanched in the face of her rage.</p><p>"  Wha…what!"</p><p>"  SHUT YOUR FILTHY MOUTH." Nodoka screamed, trembling with anger and giving of a  blood red battle aura.</p><p>Ranma  did as asked.</p><p>" THE  DOJO. NOW!" Was all she said before pulling the blade of her katana from his  neck. Whirling around she strode away, her retreating back telling him just how  despicable she found him.</p><p>Ranma's  heart sank, deep into an endless pit of despair. He swallowed loudly. Beneath  the red silk of his shirt his shoulders slumped. His face crumpled like a  rockslide. His heart felt suddenly empty, desolate and wasted. Vaguely aware of  himself trembling as his insides turned to ice, he became walking to cover the  weakness. His steps were slow, the souls of his feet dragging as he trudged  towards the training hall.</p><p>"  Ranma?" a gentle voice said.</p><p>"  Huh?"</p><p>He  turned to face Akane, her blue eyes were open wide, and they seemed to shimmer  even in the pitiful light of the season.   She put a hand on his shoulder tentatively, as if she feared to touch  him. Her lips were parted slightly, words wanting to burst out of her, so many  thoughts to verbalise, so much to be said yet nothing to say. Finally she  calmed.</p><p>"  Ranma, what are you going to do?" she asked.</p><p>He  stared at her with wide eyes that were so vacant she wondered if he actually  saw her.</p><p>"  Why, I'm going to the dojo." He said, as if it was the most obvious thing in  the world.</p><p>The  nervousness in Akane's touch vanished as she moved closer and squeezed at his  shoulder.</p><p>" But  your mother was so angry." She said, hanging her head for a moment before  fixing him again with those big, cerulean orbs. " What of she holds you to your  promise? You'd…I'd…" There was more. But the words would not come. Her voice  had abandoned her, caught in her throat.</p><p>Ranma  smiled sadly. Gently he took her hand in his and took it from his shoulder. His  touch lingering much longer than it had to. The contact electrified her; her  body tingled and skin felt warm. Then it was over, he let go.</p><p>" So  what if she does." He said. " I don't what I've done that was so terrible I  just fought a duel. Just like always. But she is ashamed of me, repulsed by me.  I can't let think of me like that." He sighed, and then tensed. Some of his  strength and resolve returned as he steeled himself. " Whatever wrong I've  done, she will be greater mortified if I run or beg like a coward. If I do not  fail now, and hold my head high, then at least she will know I faced death as a  man amongst men should."</p><p>" But  Ranma…?" That was all Akane could say.</p><p>"  Death doesn't frighten me Akane." He declared in a tone of steel. " We all die.  It is how I die that I am afraid of. And if the reaper comes for me today, I  will look him in the eye and laugh in his face."</p><p>Then  with head held high, he carried on towards the dojo. But this time his feet were  not heavy as he strode proudly onwards, the walk of a lion.  He moved resolutely across the garden, the  last cherry blossom petals swirling around him. He slid open the shogi door of  the Tendo Training Hall of Anything-Goes Martial Arts, and entered. Disappearing  from her sight.</p><p>His  mother knelt on the polished wooden floor, unmoving. Her posture was solid and  stern as if she were built from stone. The room was filled with gloom and  shadows from the weak winter sun. Paper lanterns had been lit and sat in the  four corners, radiating pale, orange light that cast a long, stretched shadow  of the kneeling woman across the waxed floorboards. A few loose auburn curls  hung across her meditatively closed eyes, hanging over the pure, white headband  that she wore wrapped around her brow. The katana lay across her lap, clenched  tightly in her fingers.</p><p>Ranma  swallowed, knots of ice twisting and writhing in his stomach. He had lied to  Akane. He was afraid to die. He did not believe in heaven or reincarnation. The  idea of a life beyond this one seemed an idealistic fantasy. But the thought of  oblivion, a full stop his book of life, nothingness, a void, an end. It was a  truly terrifying and bitter pill.</p><p>Now  he stood before he mother, the pace's worth of space that separated them seemed  like the final step from the brink of the abyss. Steeling himself, he lowered  himself onto his right knee and then knelt on both, folding his hands in his  lap.</p><p>Nodoka  said nothing, she merely sated at him with intense, hawk-like eyes. Ranma met  his mother's eyes with his own, and hoped that she could not see his fear in  their depths. He wished them to look iron, to look resolute and honourable. If  he was to die he did not want her to think him a coward by knowing just how  scared he was.</p><p>She  reached into the folds of her kimono and pulled out a slender object. It was a  ceremonial tanto. The boy expected this. It was the match of the katana she  bore, with a plain, black scabbard and hilt.   All together it was unremarkable but for the air of quality owing to the  superior workmanship from which it was crafted. Slowly she lifted the dagger  before her, and withdrew the blade, the steel glimmering in the lantern light.  With the same care she wrapped the handle twice over in a piece of crisp, white  cloth. Placing it down, she slid it across the intervening distance between  mother and son. Then sitting back she waited.</p><p>Ranma  reached for it, stretching his hand out tentatively. His fingers trembled; he  could see them shake in the orange light. He tried to make them stop, tensing  his muscles for all he was worth, but still the hand shivered. Moving further,  his fingers grazed the white cloth around the handle. His tongue snaked out to  lick at lips that were suddenly very dry.</p><p>"  Sh…shouldn't we wait for Pops?" He asked quietly.</p><p>" I  shall deal with your father when the time comes. But it is your own actions  that you should concern yourself with for now." His mother replied in an  emotionless voice.</p><p>With  a deep breath he forced his hand to close around the handle. Then he slowly  inch by inch began to raise the tanto from the waxed wood floor. The light from  the lanterns slid in waves along the curved length of the blade, a star of  orange light blossoming at the point. Then his fear managed to barge past the  walls imposed by his sense of honour, and in a tiny, broken voice he asked the  question that spun in his heart.</p><p>"  Why?"</p><p>The  woman before him made now reply, so he tried again, he had to know.</p><p>" Why  Mother? You said you did not care about the curse? So why?"</p><p>"  Stop hiding behind you curse." She spat. " It is irrelevant."</p><p>" If  it is not the curse then what, makes you doubt my manhood?" He cried.</p><p>Flames  of rage burned in his mother's eyes, her hands clawed at the fabric of kimono  as she fought down the fury.</p><p>" Yet another thing he failed to teach you I see." She  murmured. " Ranma, being a man goes beyond simply being male."</p><p>"  Huh?" Was all he could say.</p><p>"  Ranma the oath was never about your form, or about the macho attitude that you  seem to deem manly." She paused, eyes rolling back slightly as she seemed to  consider something. " Well not much." She added.</p><p>" The  oath was about something more, something greater. It was about honour. When I  made your father sign that contract it was to ensure that you would grow to be  a just and honourable person. You were born as the heir to a martial arts  school; it was your heritage to learn the Art, to master it. But I had seen how  such talent and training could corrupt a person. The power granted them by their  discipline twist their minds and makes them slaves to their own selfish and  greedy appetites. As has happened to Happosai, and to your father." The last  was spoken in a bitter whisper.</p><p>" I  could not let that happen to you." She continued. " I wanted you to different.  To be a true Master of the Art, one who used his skills wisely, his fists bound  by the code of bushido. A warrior."</p><p>" But  Mother, I am warrior. I have honour."</p><p>He  never saw her move. Just the deep sting that remained after her full armed slap  whipped across his face. Lights flickered across his sight at his jaw was  nearly knocked off hinge. Ryoga's fists did not hurt that much, although the  pain was mostly in his heart and not his cheek.</p><p>" How  dare you say that?" She spat. " After what you have just done to that boy.  Honour? Bah! You do not know the meaning of the word."</p><p>" But  that was a duel." He protested.</p><p>"  That was a slaughter." Nodoka screamed. " You picked him apart, piece by piece.  He was no challenge to you, and from what stories I have heard he never had  been. Yet you went at him mercilessly, where you should have instead shown  restraint. You used potentially fatal strikes to vital organs, broke his nose,  and even kicked him when he was down. That is the behaviour of a dog not a warrior."</p><p>" But  he was trying to kill me. They all do." He said a flash of anger returning.</p><p>" You  know he stood no chance of that. And even so. You could have disarmed him  easily enough, or rendered him unconscious at the start. But instead you  dragged the fight out so that you could inflict greater damage on him. The word  used to describe such behaviour is <i>torture</i>."</p><p>Ranma  dropped his head at his mother's scathing accusations. It was true. He saw that  now. Shame flooded his being; he despised himself. He felt lower than the worms  in the soil. Guilt welled up in him, rising and building as Nodoka drove home  her prosecution.</p><p>" It was  not just today. There are other such examples of your disgrace. Your arrogance.  The way you treat your fiancé. Granted Akane is not easy to live with, but she  does not deserve the disrespect you give her. You are also leading on no less  than four women." Ranma opened his mouth to protest, but was forestalled. " I  know that you do not encourage them but you do not actively discourage them  either. And your reported behaviour with Ms. Shampoo over the reversal jewel  incident shows that you find some sort of egotistical pleasure in having these  women follow you. I also hear that you attributed that to your 'sense of  honour'."</p><p>" However  the most damning evidence has come recently, with how you dealt with your  defeat at the hands of Loaf. A true man would learn from his loss and accept  it. It is said defeat makes us stronger. But it made you weak at first, as you  hid in your room moping, lashing out at the world around and burying your head  in the sand. You gave up instead of fighting back. And then that damned Hibiki  boy came. He got you out of bed at least. But then you became worse, bitter and  twisted by your own pride you turned rude and insulting, snapping at everyone  like a cornered lion. And it is this behaviour that led you to the despicable  events of this morning. You are no warrior, but a mad dog, and should be dealt  with the same way."</p><p>Tears  rolled uninhibited from down Ranma's cheek, he could not hold them in. The  salty droplets of shame welled up and streamed, falling from his chin and his  head hung low, bangs like a raven-black curtain over the weeping eyes. <i>Men  do not cry</i>, one part of his mind said. But he did not care, nor did he try  and stop the tears. He had already proven that he was no man, so it was  perfectly fine for him to cry.</p><p>He  clenched his fist around the tanto, lifted it from the floor again. Seizing the  handle with to hands he turned the blade so that it pointed towards his belly  ready to make the z shaped incision that would spill out his shame and  dishonour as well as he guts and blood. His knuckles were white, and his hands  still trembled. He stared at his mother determinately, his vision blurry with  tears, as she stood and pulled her swords free of it's sheath, the ring of  sliding metal hung in the air. She raised it above her left shoulder preparing  for the mercy stroke that would cleave his head from his shoulders.</p><p>"  Ranma," she said softly, almost tenderly. " Are you afraid to die."</p><p>"  Yes," he whispered. Now was not a time to lie.</p><p>"  Then why are you doing this?" She asked.</p><p>"  There is no other way." He replied, his mind spun with confusion. Was this some  sort of test?</p><p>" Yes  there is. You could run. It is your choice."</p><p>He  could but what would be the point. Why run and live the life of a coward. All  his life he had bragged and postured, so proud of his manliness, his skill in  the art, his sleek and handsome looks. Now he realised it was false. But at  least now he had a chance. An opportunity to be a real man, for one brief,  shining moment.</p><p>" I  choose death," he declared and pulled the knife at his stomach.</p><p><b>"  STOP!"</b>.</p><p>The sword clattered to the floor, cast aside suddenly. Nodoka  braced herself against her son, her hands seizing the blade tightly to halt its  path. Her muscles bunched as she fought her son to bring the tanto to a stop.  Blood glistened wetly, a thin layer of red smeared across the steel. Nodoka  winced slightly at the stinging pain as the dagger bit into her flesh. Grabbing  the blade harder she pulled the weapon from Ranma's now numb fingers.</p><p>" Why?" He said, eyes wide  and welled with tears.</p><p>" My son," she gasped, her  voice breaking. " You do not know how glad I am to hear your words." She could  not take it any longer as her will snapped like strained metal. She collapsed  in to Ranma's arms hugging the boy to her furiously as she unleashed a storm of  weeping.</p><p>" There is still hope." She  declared, forcing the words out between her sobs.</p><p>Ranma open his mouth but no  sound came out. His mind was blank and empty, frozen with astonishment. He was  shell-shocked, kneeling dumbly as his mother wept in his arms. He could not  move, his body stiffening as if made of stone.</p><p>" Hope?" he muttered when  enough of his brain returned for him to review hat she had said.</p><p>Nodoka pulled away from him  and smiled, the warmth and pride in her eyes lit her face making her glow  radiantly despite the tears that rolled down her face.</p><p>" Yes son, hope." She said,  and then looking at his face, numb with shock and confusion, she laughed. " I  must explain," she said.</p><p>Once again reaching into her  kimono, she pulled out a thin and somewhat flimsy paperback. Placing it on the  floor in front of him she presented it for his inspection. It was small and  slender, too little for it to be a novel. It was in good condition but the  creased spine and yellow tinged page showed that it had been well read. The  yellow cover, illustrated with a colour print of a man standing in a wind swept  hakama gazing reverently at pink cherry blossom tree, was now stained with red  thumbprints from Nodoka bloody hands. Written in a column of beautiful Kanji  was the book's title:</p>THE HAGAKURE    By Tsunetomo Yamamoto<p>" What's this?" Ranma asked, pointing at the book.</p><p>Nodoka smiled a warm,  motherly grin. She ran her fingers over the book tenderly, as if it were an old  friend or lover. A trail of blood followed in the path of her touch.</p><p>" Soon after your father  took you away I realised what a burden the oath had placed upon. As the wife of  a martial artist I knew that matters of honour were gravely important, but  something of this magnitude. A pact of seppuku signed by a child. It made me  question the meaning of honour. I had many lonely hours after you and Genma left  in which to contemplate. What is honour? And so I read books like this one in  an attempt to understand."</p><p>" It was written during the  eighteenth century during the Tokugawa reign. The shogunate ruled Japan with an  iron hand, which ensured a lengthy period of peace. Without battles to wage,  Samurai turned to the other gentlemanly arts that were reserved for men of  their class: Painting, poetry and literature. It gave many warriors a time to  reflect on the code of Bushido and to express their own personal views. This  book details the ideals of a Samurai grieving for the death of his lord. In  these pages are his philosophy and his creed."</p><p>She nudged the book closer  to him indicating that he should take it. " Open it my son." Ranma did so,  handling the book with slow, gentle hands, as if he feared it would break.</p><p>" Turn to the first chapter  and read the first paragraph, then you will understand." His mother promised,  still smiling yet watching him with anxious and fascinated eyes. Slowly and  cautiously he turned the pages, one by one. Finding the opening chapter he  scanned his eyes along the neatly printed text.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Chapter  One. The Essence of Bushido.</i></p><p style="text-align:center;"><i>I  have found the essence of bushido, to die. In other </i></p><p style="text-align:center;"><i>words,  when you have a choice of life and death, then</i></p><p style="text-align:center;"><i> always choose death; this is not all you must  remember. </i></p><p style="text-align:center;"><i>It  is neither troublesome nor difficult. You only have to go</i></p><p style="text-align:center;"><i> on with a clenched stomach. Any other ideas  are</i></p><p style="text-align:center;"><i> unnecessary and futile.                                                                                                    </i></p><p>Ranma read the words. And then he read them again,  and again, eyes absorbing the letters hungrily. Finally he stared up at his  mother with wide, glimmering eyes. His mouth hung open in shock. The book  dropped from his nerveless fingers, pages fluttering as it hit the floor.</p><p>" Now you see son. By choosing death; by willing to  die for your honour you show that all is not lost. You can take responsibility  for your actions, and your mistakes instead of hiding behind cowardly excuses,  like your curse. You can be reset on the path of the warrior and earn true  honour."</p><p>" True honour." He asked. His mother nodded.</p><p>" I cannot force you into suicide when there is  still hope. Nor can I punish you for a failing that is mine as well as yours."</p><p>" You have not failed in anything Mother."</p><p>Nodoka shook her head, fresh tears beginning to  gather in her cerulean eyes, eyes that matched his own and tears that were  twins to those on his own cheeks.</p><p>" It is my fault. Cologne showed me that, she was  also the one who convinced me not to give up hope. She taught me that a child  cannot grow to be complete with only one parent. When I let your father take  you I robbed you of your honour myself. Your father taught you martial arts,  and he did a fine job. I am proud of him." She ignored Ranma's derisive snort.  " But he could not teach you tolerance, respect or manners. That should have  been my task, my duty as your mother."</p><p>Her hands balled into fists, and she turned her head  as she snarled in anger at her own mistake. Ranma reached out and cupped her  chin, gently tilting her face so that she could look into her eyes. He smiled  down at her warmly, hand dropping to squeeze her shoulder in reassurance.</p><p>" You did not fail, Mother. You could never fail  me." He said softly. Nodoka took his softly lifted it from her. The gesture  painfully reminded him of the same rejection he had used to push aside Akane's  help.</p><p>" Your concern touches me Ranma, but you are blinded  by it." She said sadly. " I did fail you, but as I said there is hope, and I  can make up for my mistake."</p><p>" You will teach me honour?" He asked, unable to  keep the childlike excitement from his voice. Teaching meant that she would  spend time with him, show him things. A gesture of true mother-son bonding,  tying them together by something stronger than mere blood. It was something  that he had so desperately, and so painfully yearned for since she had  re-entered his life.</p><p>Nodoka laughed, a rich musical sound like the soft  ringing of silver bells." If only it were that simple." She sighed. " I can not  <i>teach</i> you honour Ranma. Only show you the path, <i>you </i>must walk it.  I can tell you where you and your father have gone wrong, like so many others."</p><p>" Where?" He asked impulsively, curious and still  wrapped in childish glee.</p><p>" Both you and Genma have misunderstood the true  meaning of honour, the core of the code, its soul. You think that it is about  you, about yourself. But you are wrong, that is arrogance not honour. Honour  lies not in you, but in what you can do for others. It lies in duty, duty is  the path of true honour."</p><p>" That makes no sense." Ranma declared, his brow  furrowing. " Why then was I taught by father, Cologne and even you to be proud  of myself and my abilities."</p><p>" There is a vast difference between pride and  arrogance Ranma. A proud warrior believes in himself and in his duties no  matter what others may say. You Ranma, are conceited, you flaunt your skills  before people to make them acknowledge you are the best. You are cocky about  your fiancés, your abilities and your looks. You believed this to be honour  when truly all it was, was vanity. Even the fights you claimed were for your  honour were merely about your ego. You scoured the depths of despair to use the  Shi Shi Hokodan, because you feared it made someone stronger than you. You  chased down Herb because he locked you in your cursed form, while this was  admirable in that you sought to avenge a grievous insult and retain your true  form, your primary motive was that your ego would not except being a girl, You  challenged that sweet, misguided boy Ryu Kumon because he stole your name and  although a man's name is important once again vanity in that he was stronger  than you and had usurped your place was your reason for the duel. Yet once  again, you proved there was hop in the way you fought Saffron for your friends  and fiancés lives."</p><p>" So then why should I fight mother?" Ranma asked,  her speech turning his whole world and his pride in his past achievements and  their heads and sent them spinning.</p><p>" You are a warrior Ranma. You fight because it is  the right thing to do, and because it is your duty. Remember Saffron you  battled him to protect the ones you care about. That is your duty. You fought  against Loaf for the school. That is your greatest duty. Remember you are the  heir to the Anything-Goes School of Martial Arts, your duty to the Art is first  and foremost Ranma."</p><p>" My duty to the Art is first and foremost." Ranma  repeated, the words revolving in his mind, chanting in a silent mantra.<i> My  duty to the Art is first and foremost. My duty to the Art is first and  foremost.</i></p><p>Smiling proudly, Nodoka leaned over and gathered her  sons face in her hands. Tilting her head she pressed her lips to her forehead  in a warm gesture of motherly affection. Then she allowed her fingers to smooth  his hair as she had done when he was a child, before she pushed herself to her  feet.</p><p>" The others shall be worried." She said, untying  the white headband from her brow and letting it fall to the ground. " Keep the  book Ranma", she said gesturing to the blood stained copy of the Hagakure. " I  have given you a lot to think about. You now see the true path of the warrior,  now you must take the first step."</p><p>Ranma heard her walk across the dojo, her steps  making regular and proper percussions against the polished floor. Then her  heard the shogi door open and then shut. He did not move, remaining where he  was, kneeling arms folded in his lap. His blue-grey eyes shone in the lantern  light, the colour of a dawn sky as he stared unblinkingly ahead. He had a lot  on his mind.</p><p><i>My duty to the Art is first and foremost.</i></p><p>AN- And so now the truth  behind the title is revealed. In this chapter I sketched out my ideal vision of  a martial artist hero, everything a legendary master of the art like Ranma should  be. This will be Ranma's aim in the future of the story. You see as much as I  like Ranma, it is undeniable that he can be a total jerk. And so I set him on  the path of improvement. However it wont happen overnight. That would be too  easy, and less funny. His life will still be complicated and chaotic, so don't  worry about that,</p><p>Also as a cultural note the Hagakure is a real book  written by a samurai who was forbidden to commit suicide and follow his master  into the afterlife. He became a hermit and spurned the world, writing down his  beliefs in a book he never wanted publishing</p><p>( Hagakure means hidden beneath the leaves.) However it was and  influenced many people even today.</p><p>Also the stance I had Ranma use the Shizentai Kamae. It  is a neutral fighting posture of relaxed readiness popular in martial arts such  as Judo, Aikido and Wado-ryu karate. I myself am fond of the stance in my own  martial arts practice so expect to see it in the future.</p><p>Oh and can the people who I e-mailed about proof-reading  mail back so the next chapter can be the first that is proofread by others.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Beer-monster.</p>
