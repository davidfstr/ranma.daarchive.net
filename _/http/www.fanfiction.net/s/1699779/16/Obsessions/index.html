</div><p>Chapter  Sixteen</p><p><u>The Long  Awaited Journey</u></p><p>A smile drew itself across Ranma's face.  That smile quickly manifested itself into  laughter.</p><p>"Yea Akane…it's really is true…this…this is  unbelievable…this is great!"  Ranma  said, turning to the smiling Akane and giving her a giant hug, actually lifting  her up and spinning her around.</p><p>"Ranma…come on…put me down…you're worrying everyone  else."</p><p>"Ranma!"   Genma demanded.  "What happened!"</p><p>"Pops…you're not gonna believe it.  Get a load'a this!"  Ranma said, pushing the two pieces of paper  into his face.  Genma's eyes  widened.  Soun approached, more tears  filled his eyes.  Tears of joy.</p><p>"Ranma…those are…"</p><p>"Yea pops…Round trip tickets to China!"  Ranma exclaimed.  "I can become a real man once and for all!"</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>"Ranma…I'm so happy for you!"  Akane said, excitedly.  Just then she noticed that Genma and Ryoga  looked a bit down.</p><p>"Use your gift well boy."  Genma said, retuning to his seat.  Ranma went to his father.</p><p>"Hey pops…don't worry.  I'll bring ya some <i>nannichaun</i>, once we make it to  Jusenkyo."</p><p>"I'm happy for you both'' Ryoga said.  He tried a smile.</p><p>"Hmm…I guess I could bring some back for you too…"</p><p>"Wait a second Ranma!"  Akane said, running upstairs.   She brought down her little red purse, spilling its contents over the  kitchen table.  She triumphantly held up  25,000-yen.  All she had left.</p><p>"Uh…Akane…that's only enough for one ticket…"</p><p>Akane eyed Ranma sadly…it <i>was</i> only enough for  just one.</p><p>Ryoga spoke up.   " I will give up…"</p><p>Genma cut him off.   "Go Ryoga.  It would be strange  to have their father around on their honeymoon.  Make sure to bring back the <i>nannichaun</i> for me."</p><p>"Mr. Saotome… I am honored to call you friend."  Ryoga said.</p><p>Genma nodded, proudly.</p><p>A thought hit Ranma during all this.</p><p>"This <i>would</i> make the perfect honeymoon!"  He said to himself.  Akane tapped him on the shoulder, pointing  at the ticket.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…I think we should postpone the wedding  until we get back.  These tickets are  for tomorrow.  That really isn't enough time."</p><p>"Huh?"  Ranma  asked, examining the tickets.   "Dang…you're right.  I did kinda  want mom to come to our wedding.  And we  have to pack and stuff…"</p><p>"This will be perfect for you two."  Soun said.   "A honeymoon before a marriage.   Then you can have another honeymoon after.  The time you are away would give time for us to plan everything  and even give us a chance to call your mother Ranma!"</p><p>"Great!"   Ranma said excitedly.  He turned  to Ryoga who was holding the money.</p><p>"Hey…what about Ryoga here.  If he went by himself he would never find  Jusenkyo.  Either that or he would walk  right into another spring."</p><p>Akane smiled.   She had the perfect idea.</p><p>"Why don't we all go together?  We can make this a group trip.  It will be fun!"</p><p>Ryoga's eyes widened.  "A trip with Akane…" he thought to himself.  "Sure…she belongs to Ranma…but I could be  with her for a few more weeks before it happened!  If Akane was happy…then I wouldn't mind her being with  Ranma.  Just as long as I could be near  her."</p><p>"Oh…Akane…I don't want to intrude…" he started</p><p>Akane cut him off.   "No…we insist…don't we Ranma" she said, eyeing him with a smile</p><p>"Hey…the more the merrier.  That will give us a chance to have our little match…huh  Ryoga?  Besides…I was the one that  knocked you in the spring in the first place.   What do you say?  I caused your  curse…so I'll help ya get your cure."</p><p>Ryoga nodded, a smile was working itself across his  face, finally feeling Ranma's excitement about finally being cured.</p><p>Akane started to go outside.  Ranma was humming to himself happily.  Ryoga was smiling broadly…picturing walking  outside during rainstorms on two legs instead of four.  Ranma caught Akane leaving out the corner of  his eye.</p><p>"Hey Akane…where you goin'?" he asked.</p><p>"The more the merrier right?  I have one more friend that I want to bring  along. "</p><p><u>Friendship</u></p><p>"Jusenkyo!"   Ukyo exclaimed.  "Sure!  I would love to go!  You, Ranma and Ryoga are goin' right?"</p><p>Everyone nodded, excitedly.</p><p>"Then count me in!   We have all been in this for a long time.  I would hate to miss anything that happened out there.  Besides…I could practice more Okonomiyaki  recipes.  I could be the cook of the  trip!"</p><p>"Yea!  Isn't  this so cool!"  Ranma said.</p><p>"This is going to be great!  See you tomorrow!  Meet us at the Dojo at 7 am.   Don't forget your 25,000-yen for the ticket."  Akane said</p><p>"Oh…that's no problem.  I'll just take it from my savings.  I was saving up for…" Ukyo trailed off her words, blushing a bit.</p><p>"For what Uc-Chan?"   Ranma asked.</p><p>"For…<i>our</i> wedding.  There is more than enough for a ticket for me.  We could even get a few souvenirs."</p><p>Ranma just smiled at Ukyo.  Ukyo returned a timid smile, blushing a bit.  Akane was taking it all in good fun. The  three turned and left, leaving Ukyo alone to attend her store for one last day.</p><p>"A trip with Ran-Chan…how could I say no.  I may have lost the battle and the war…but  that doesn't mean I can't be his friend.   If he was just happy…no matter who he chose, I would be too.  Just as long as I could be with him." Ukyo  thought to herself, smiling.  This was  going to be great.</p><p>The three retuned to the Dojo.  Ranma was going around with Ryoga  singing  "I'm gonna be a man again!"  Akane just shook her head.  Those two were so happy.  Suddenly, a thought hit Akane.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…who sent us those tickets?"  She asked, stopping his singing.</p><p>"Hmm…I dunno."   Ranma said, retrieving the envelope.   It was empty, save a post card.</p><p>"See Ranma…you were so excited that you forgot to  see if there was anything else inside."   Akane said.</p><p>Ranma looked at the little picture.  It was of a little shop of some sort.  He flipped it around, reading what was on  the reverse side:</p><p><i>Come in come in, </i></p><p><i>To the Kat Cafe</i></p><p><i>Tastes great can't wait </i></p><p><i>At the Kat Cafe</i></p><p><i>The noodles are good: </i></p><p><i>You know that you  should...</i></p><p><i>Come to the Kat Cafe!</i></p><p>There was a little stamp of a kitten in the  corner.  Everyone knew who sent those  tickets.</p><p>"Cologne and Shampoo…" Akane said.  "Does this mean…"</p><p>"…that Shampoo loves Mousse now…maybe they are  inviting us to their wedding!"  Ranma  said.</p><p>"Oh my…things have gone that far in less than two  weeks…incredible."  Akane said.</p><p>"Yea…well it's a good thing everyone is comin'  along.  After the wedding we can all  celebrate with a tall glass of…<i>nannichaun</i>!"  Ranma said, resuming his little song.</p><p>The bubbly, excited atmosphere continued into  dinner.  Soun and Genma were making  wedding plans with Kasumi helping them.   Ranma and Akane's wedding needed a woman's touch.  Everyone ate his or her food happily.  Today was the best day yet, and there were  still many more days ahead.</p><p>Ranma and Akane finished their meal rather  quickly.  They still had to finish  packing.  Ryoga already had all he  needed in his backpack, complete with impossibly heavy bamboo umbrella.</p><p>The couple raced upstairs, grabbing their bags and  hurriedly throwing stuff inside.  Ranma  was again humming his little tune to himself.   He looked over to Akane, who was just as happy as he was.  Maybe even more so.</p><p>"Hey Akane…how long do you think this trip would  take?" he asked, wondering how many clothes to bring along.</p><p>"I dunno Ranma…I would say two weeks at least.  We have to fly to China and then hike to  Jusenkyo."</p><p>"Yea…maybe we could train a little bit on the way,"  Ranma said.</p><p>"Yea…no doubt we would with Cologne there."</p><p>The night marched on quickly.  Ranma and Akane sat on their bed, eyeing  their bags.</p><p>"You know…this is like some sorta dream or  somethin'" Ranma finally said.  "I still  can't believe it.  I can become a man  once and for all…then I get married to the cutest person in all of Nermia!"</p><p>"R…Ranma…don't say that.  Its embarrassing."  Akane  said, blushing.</p><p>"Well…it's true…"</p><p>"You think you are so cool don't you…sitting there  all confident.  Remember…I <i>could</i>  change my mind about the wedding."</p><p>Ranma looked to Akane, she was wearing that cute  smile of hers.  Ranma just got up,  grabbing his nightclothes.</p><p>"Ranma…what are you doing?"  Akane asked</p><p>"The sooner I get to sleep the sooner I can become a  real man."</p><p>Akane nodded.   Ranma left to go change and take his bath.  Akane got dressed in her pajamas and lie in the bed, waiting for  Ranma.</p><p>Ranma returned after a while.  He got in his side of the bed, saying good  night to Akane.  Akane switched off the  lights, hoping for a nice sleep.  So  much for that.  Ranma just tossed around  sleeplessly.  He was a little too  excited about tomorrow.</p><p>Akane hit him for not letting her sleep.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…you're the one that needs to chill out  now."</p><p>"Sorry Akane…I can't sleep.  I'm just so happy!"</p><p>Akane sighed, giving up her fight.  They would get to sleep eventually.  "Well it would help to go to bed at a decent  hour, say 11 or so.  I think 8:30 is a  bit too early to try to sleep."</p><p>Ranma just lay there, staring at the ceiling,  smiling to himself.  He turned to Akane,  his mind reaching something.</p><p>"Hey Akane…how do you feel about me becomin' a real  man?"  Ranma asked seriously.</p><p>Akane was a bit stunned at that.  She sat up, thinking for just a few seconds.</p><p>"Well Ranma…if it's what you want then go for  it.  Don't do this just for me.  I already told you that I would love you no  matter what curse you had.  If doing  this makes you happy, then I'm all for it!   Besides…I <i>always</i> considered you a real man."  She said, smiling.</p><p>"Thanks Akane…" Ranma said, resuming his lying  position.</p><p>"I would miss her though…" Akane admitted.  Ranma rose, looking at her.</p><p>"I always thought of her as a good friend or sister  I never had.  She was fun, and  athletic.  She was also warm and soft,  almost like a best friend you would hug if anything were wrong…but don't let  that stop you Ranma.  I know it must be  hard on a person to have such a curse.   Just forget what I said.  Let's  try to get some sleep."  Akane turned,  pulling the covers up to her neck.</p><p>Ranma followed suit, lying on his back.  He thought seriously about his curse for the  first time in a long time.  What did  Akane really want?</p><p>"Hey Akane…what do you really want?  You want me to keep this curse of get rid of  it?"  He asked seriously.</p><p>"Ranma…I said just forget about what I said…"</p><p>"Come on Akane…this affects me just as much as it  does you.  You have ta' tell me what you  think about it…really."</p><p>Akane thought for a few minutes.  "You want to know what I really want  Ranma?"  She asked, turning and looking  him in the eye.  The moon highlighted  Ranma's face.  Akane saw how serious he  was.</p><p>"I just want you happy Ranma.  That is all I really ever did want."  Akane said, smiling.  Ranma returned her smile</p><p>"Thanks Akane.   I guess I would miss her too…" Ranma said.</p><p>Eventually the couple fell asleep, waking bright and  early at morning.</p><p><u>Departure!</u></p><p>Ranma's eyes popped open, taking in the  sunshine.  His head was almost  completely covered in blanket.  He  looked toward where he was facing.  No  Akane was next to him.  He sat up,  seeing Akane getting dressed for the day.   She was wearing that cute little skirt bottom, in the process of putting  on the matching light blue top.  Ranma  looked on, shocked a bit.  Akane turned  to him, slipping the top on. He leaned back; afraid he had done something in  seeing Akane in her bra.</p><p>"Hurry up Ranma!"   Akane said, approaching him.   Ranma slid over a bit.  Akane  just sat next to him, putting on her socks.</p><p>She looked over to Ranma, concerned.  "What?   Something wrong?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head slowly  "No…nothing is wrong…"</p><p>"Whatever Ranma…the plane leaves in two hours and we  still have to walk to the airport.''</p><p>Ranma nodded, smiling.  The sun was in full view in their window.  Ranma got dressed quickly and he and Akane  ran down stairs.  The rest of the  household greeted them.</p><p>"Ready to go Ranma?"  Ryoga asked, already prepared for long journeys.  Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Yea…lets do this…once and for all."</p><p>The three started outside.  Kasumi stopped them, handing each a small basket.</p><p>"I heard that airline food is not too good.  I packed enough to get you to China.  Do eat it all; it's wonderful.  You will need all your strength if you are  to hike all the way to Jusenkyo.  Have a  wonderful time!"  Kasumi said, with her  smile, brighter than the morning sun.   That made everyone smile.</p><p>"Don't worry pops…I'll be sure to bring ya the <i>nannichaun</i>."</p><p>Genma just nodded, hiding his excitement.</p><p>Everyone said their goodbyes and started to the  door.  A knock came from it  suddenly.  Curious, Akane opened the  door, seeing Ukyo, smiling and waving to them, spatula and all.</p><p>"Ukyo?"   Ryoga asked, confused.  "Did you  go to China while I was gone?"</p><p>"No sugar…I'm going to keep Akane company.  Being with two men could be taxing on the  nerves, couldn't it?"  Ukyo asked,  looking to Akane.</p><p>"Yea…and knowing their track record for fights I  could use another referee."  Akane  replied brightly.</p><p>Kasumi neared Ukyo, handing her a small basket of  food and smiling happily.  Ukyo nodded  approvingly.</p><p>The four travelers started to the airport.  Ranma and Akane had their tickets.  Ryoga had his yen and so did Ukyo.</p><p>They walked down the street, Ranma and Ryoga were  leading the pack, happily walking along, and humming.  Akane looked around to the fresh morning that was appearing.  It was a very cool morning, dew forming on  everything that was left outside.  It  was a little bit chilly for it being almost summertime.  Akane breathed in, the cool moist air felt  nice inside her lungs, giving her a burst of energy.</p><p>Ukyo thought to herself silently.  She couldn't help but feel like she was  intruding.  She looked at Ranma and  Akane.  That day was drawing ever  closer.</p><p>"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea to be here.  I still do love him.  This may end up biting me …well; I'll just  handle it.  I just want to be with  him…before it happened," Ukyo shrugged off her feelings and looked to  Akane.</p><p>"Just look at those two ahead of us…" she  whispered.  "Like two little kids going  to the toy store…"</p><p>"Yea…" Akane said thoughtfully.  "They must be so happy to finally get rid of  their curses once and for all.  I hope  everything goes well…these trips to China always seemed to be ruined somehow."</p><p>"I don't know Akane.  I have a pretty good feeling nothing can stop those two from  going to China…even if they have to swim there."</p><p>Akane nodded, proceeding down the street a little  more.  Ukyo spoke up again, whispering  to Akane.</p><p>"So…Akane…how far have you gone with Ranma?"  She asked slyly.</p><p>"W-what!"   Akane asked loudly.  "What do you  mean…" she turned, seeing Ranma and Ryoga looking at her.</p><p>"Hey…what are you two doin'?" Ranma asked, puzzled.</p><p>"Oh…nothing Ranma…I…was just amazed that you and  Ryoga are getting along so nicely!"   Akane managed with a nervous smile.</p><p>Ranma shrugged and continued walking.</p><p>"Ukyo!  What  are you trying to pull?"  Akane said in  a forceful whisper.</p><p>"Hey…I was just wondering…you know…you <i>are</i>  fiancées…"</p><p>"Well…we've kissed a few times…our fathers moved all  his stuff into my room and we share a bed."   Akane said, starting to blush.</p><p>"Oh…do tell…" Ukyo said, enjoying this.  "Have you two…<i>sealed</i> your  relationship.'' She asked.</p><p>"What!  No…of  course not!"  Akane almost shouted.  Ranma and Ryoga turned to those two again, puzzled.</p><p>"No what Akane?"   Ranma asked.</p><p>Akane waved her hands around furiously.  "It's…nothing Ranma…"</p><p>"Oh…Akane and I were just talking about whether or  not you two have had…" Akane promptly put her hand over Ukyo's mouth, stunning  Ukyo a bit.</p><p>"Whether we have had <i>breakfast</i>!"  Akane said, her face now a deep red color.</p><p>Ranma eyed his fiancée; she was embarrassed over  something.</p><p>"Well whatever…" Ranma said.  He put the incident out of his mind.</p><p>"Ukyo!  What  are you doing!"  Akane asked.  She realized that Ukyo couldn't talk very  well with her hand over her mouth.  She  released her, who was thoroughly enjoying Akane's plight.</p><p>"I was just wondering…you know…once you got married  it's only right to…"</p><p>"Yea I know…just not right now."  Akane said, resuming her whispering.</p><p>"Well…have you ever wanted to?"  Ukyo asked.</p><p>Akane turned her gaze into the ground, flustered.</p><p>"Well…once, when Ranma and I were training…then that  first night we shared a room I had a dream about it…" Akane resumed her  demeanor, her face still red.</p><p>"Why are you asking me all this Ukyo?"  She demanded.</p><p>Ukyo just smiled.   "Just trying to help things along sugar!"  She replied happily. Maybe she could help things along a  bit…"Come on…I know what love is like…just look at Ranma…walking there all  confidently."</p><p>Akane looked over to Ranma, walking in that  confident manner.  She had always loved the  way he walked.  He and Ryoga were  talking about something. She turned back to Ukyo.  She had a "So…what do you think" look on her face.</p><p>"I guess maybe one day."  Akane admitted to her friend.   "But I don't want to rush Ranma into it."</p><p>"Oh, come on Akane…I went to an all guys'  school.  Trust me…you are <i>not</i>  rushing this.  In fact I'll bet he's  waiting for you to make the first move."</p><p>Akane eyed Ukyo.   "What do you mean?"</p><p>Ukyo just winked, continuing silently.  Akane gave up and walked along side Ukyo.  Eventually they reached the airport.</p><p>Ranma and Ryoga eyed their salvation, standing  before them in that congested mall-like structure.  Ranma turned around to the girls.</p><p>"Hey you two…keep an eye on Ryoga for me.  If we let him out of our sight for just one  second…"</p><p>Ryoga looked into the ground, he really needed to  study cartography or something.</p><p>Bravely, the party went forward, through all the  security and baggage stuff.  Ukyo  reluctantly relinquished her giant spatula and mini spatulas to the baggage  guy.  Good thing he thought they were  for cooking and not weapons…they made their way to the ticket stand.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…our tickets are next to each other.  Wouldn't it be nice if Ryoga and Ukyo sat  next to us?  That way we could plan our  trip." Akane asked with a smile.</p><p>"Sure…whatever."   Ranma said, approaching the stand.   Ryoga and Ukyo followed him.   Ranma and Akane handed them their tickets and went across the velvet  rope.  They waited for Ryoga and Ukyo.</p><p>They purchased their tickets and went over to the  waiting couple.</p><p>"So…where are you guys sitting?"  Akane asked.  Ukyo was seated right behind them.  That made Akane smile a bit.   Ryoga was sitting in the very back…he looked a bit distraught.</p><p>"You know Ranma… I kinda wanted to hear the rest of  Ryoga's story.  This would be a good  time for you two to get to know each other better too…if he sat next to Ukyo."</p><p>"Why are you tellin' me all this Akane?  What can I do about it?" Ranma asked,  puzzled.</p><p>"Ranma…you could…"</p><p>Ryoga interrupted.</p><p>"But…they gave me the very last row as a seat.  Don't I have to sit there?"  Ryoga asked.</p><p>"Not necessarily!" Akane said, the wheels in her  mind were turning.  "I have an  idea.  You two stand right here.  If Ranma wont help I'll do this myself!" She  said to Ryoga and Ukyo.  She went over  to the ticket booth with Ryoga's ticket and asked if they could switch  seats.  The guy shook his head.</p><p>Akane looked back to the two, standing there.  Ranma was puzzled, but decided to lean  against a wall.</p><p>"But sir…those two are <i>Fiancées</i>!  Won't you please let them sit next to each  other?"  Akane smiled to the two. Their  eyes hung wide open in disbelief.  Akane  waved her hand around, coaxing them to at least play the part.</p><p>The two looked at each other, before giving each  other a modest hug.  They forced a happy  smile at the ticket guy, laughing nervously.</p><p>The ticket guy relented, seeing the two hugging and  coupled with Akane's cute smile.  He  gave Ryoga the seat next to Ukyo.  The  party soon boarded the plane.</p><p>"Don't let that hug get to you sugar'' Ukyo said to  Ryoga, having already sat down.</p><p>"Don't worry about that Ukyo."  Ryoga returned</p><p><u>No Turning  Back</u></p><p>The group, having been united in their seating  arrangements, started off to the plane.   Akane and Ukyo were talking about something or another.  Ryoga was in his own little world,  daydreaming a bit.  Ranma was focused on  getting to China…no matter what.  He  approached the entry gate, eyeing it.  A  smile started across his face.</p><p>"Hey everyone.   Hurry up!"  He called out,  running inside.  Everyone quickly  followed.</p><p>The inside of the plane was a different story.  It seemed a bit cramped.  Too bad those tickets weren't first  class.  Ranma sat next to the window,  looking outside.  Akane started  unwrapping her food, eager to see what was inside.</p><p>"Um…Miss.   I'm going to have to ask you to put that little basket in your overhead  compartment.  We are about to take  off."  A guy dressed in blue said to  Akane as the intercom started with a similar message.  Everyone followed Akane's lead.   Ranma was a bit annoyed.</p><p>"Yea…like a sweet bean bun is gonna get loose and  kill someone."</p><p>"Come on Ranma…it's not that big of a deal."</p><p>Ranma shrugged, returning his vigil on the outside.</p><p>Akane just sat in her seat.  She turned back to Ukyo and Ryoga, sitting  there.  She smiled at them.  Ukyo returned her smile.  Ryoga looked a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>"I wonder what's up with Ryoga…" Akane thought to  herself.  The moving plane interrupted  any further thought.  Soon everyone  found themselves in the air, heading towards whatever lie in front of them.</p><p>Ryoga looked down to the floor.  That bad feeling had came back.   He had almost forgot about it.  He felt a sense of…hesitation.  He just shook his head and assured himself  everything would be fine.  He would  protect Akane if all else failed.   Another thought popped in his mind</p><p>"Ranma…forgave me easily yesterday…after all I did  against him…was his love of Akane that strong?   No wonder their bonds could not have been broken by mere men…" he  thought to himself.</p><p>Ranma and Akane proceeded to eat their little  snacks.  Sweet bean buns and the  like.  Quietly, everyone sat in their  seats, eating what Kasumi had given them.</p><p>About an hour passed.  Ranma was hungry again.   He looked around at what was available to him:  A bag of peanuts, and a person going down the aisle with ice  water.  Another person went down the  aisle, pushing a cart loaded with food.   Ranma sniffed the air.  It was  loaded with American Pizza slices.  They  smelled to good to resist.</p><p>"Hey Akane…what's ahead of us up there?"  Ranma asked, pointing.</p><p>"That's first class," Akane said simply.</p><p>Ranma eyed the cart being shipped to the front.</p><p>"How do you get up there?"  He asked, his eyes still on the cart.</p><p>"You spend a lot of money on airline tickets."</p><p>"No…I mean how do you go up there to get the food?"</p><p>"You don't Ranma."</p><p>Ranma thought for a minute.  "I'll bet there's a way to get up there…" he  said aloud.  He eyed the person with the  ice water.  He got an idea…</p><p>"Can I get some water?"  He asked the lady.</p><p>The lady nodded, smiling.  "Sure…anything else?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head.  "No…this is just perfect."</p><p>Ranma looked around a little bit.  He sunk low into his seat.  Akane noticed this.</p><p>"Ranma, what are you doing?" Akane asked, puzzled.</p><p>"I'm gonna get some of that pizza Akane.  You want some?"</p><p>"How are you gonna do that?"</p><p>Ranma just smiled, indicating his class of ice  water.</p><p>"Ranma you shouldn't…just forget it."  Akane said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>Ranma proceeded to pour the water on his head,  turning himself into a girl.  Ukyo  looked over the top of the seat</p><p>"Ran-Chan?   What's goin' on?"  She whispered.</p><p>"I'm gonna get some of that pizza that just went  by.  Want some?"</p><p>Ukyo nodded.   "Sure."</p><p>Ranma forced herself out into the aisle, bumping  Akane.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…watch it.  Some of us are trying to read."   She said forcefully.</p><p>Ranma did a double take.  She was reading that old book; compete with translation book by  her side.</p><p>Ranma forgot about that, focused on what do to about  her lunch.  She got a brilliant  idea.  Quickly, she grabbed Akane's  little basket and ran off to the front.   Akane was going to say something, but decided against it.  She turned back to see what was going on  behind her.  Ukyo was eagerly awaiting  her lunch.  Ryoga was asleep.</p><p>Ranma approached the guard person, standing at the  door.  The guard was male.  All the better.</p><p>"Um…excuse me mister…"Ranma started, feigning a look  of worried ness.  "My dad is in there in  first class with my mom.  They didn't  have enough money to buy a ticket for me.   I'm really scared of the big airplane and I just want to see them for  just a moment."</p><p>"Sorry miss…can't let you do that."</p><p>"But…but…I'm <i>so</i> afraid.  I just…want to give them a hug."  Ranma said, forcing a few tears.</p><p>The guard couldn't help but smile at the cute little  girl with the cute little basket.  "Go  on miss.  But make it quick."</p><p>" Oh! Thank you <i>so much</i> mister!"  Ranma replied happily walking in.</p><p>Akane watched the little happenings.  After a few moments Ranma emerged with the  basket.  She slid his way over to her  seat, opening her prize:  Pizza for  everyone.  She passed one back to Ukyo,  noticing that Ryoga was out of it for the moment.</p><p>"Congratulations Ranma" Akane said, dryly, still  working on her book.  She turned to the  female Ranma.  She was smiling proudly  and offering her a slice of her pizza as a sort of token of appreciation.  Akane couldn't help but smile.</p><p>"Might as well use it while I still got it!"  Ranma said, smiling</p><p>Akane nodded, taking a bite of the pizza.  Ranma did have a point.  She would sure miss that red-haired  pig-tailed girl.  She seemed to make  their relationship fun…never a dull moment when your fiancée could switch  genders.</p><p>After a few moments, Ranma too fell asleep.  Akane and Ukyo somehow managed to carry on a  decent conversation.</p><p>Ranma awoke after a little while, her head resting  on Akane's shoulder.  It was pretty  comfortable to him…although it was a bit hard.</p><p>Ranma stirred about a bit. "Hey…Akane, you've got  some manly shoulders…and your hands seem to have got bigger…"</p><p>"Ranma you moron…" Akane started.</p><p>"Oh, don't worry about it, I still love ya, even  with your manly physique."  Ranma said,  looking up at Akane.  Abruptly, Ranma's  smile faded into a look of extreme disgust.   He was looking at Ryoga, who was eyeing him almost angrily.</p><p>"I'm not that kind of guy Ranma…" Ryoga said  dryly.  Ranma leapt back to her  seat.  She suddenly felt sick…not form  the air travel though.  Ranma turned  back around in her seat, seeing Akane stare angrily at him.  Ukyo was having a good time with what just  happened, trying to hide her laughter.</p><p>"Manly physique huh Ranma?"  Akane asked.  "Well in that case I don't think you would mind if I just sat  back here with Ukyo for the rest of the trip."</p><p>"Oh…come on Akane…I didn't know you had switched  with Ryoga…give me a break huh?"</p><p>Akane shook her head.  "Nope, you couldn't even tell <i>who</i> was next to you…How  could you mistake Ryoga's shoulder for mine?"</p><p>"Well…first of all…" Ranma started.  Ukyo tapped her on the head.</p><p>"You better not finish that sentence Ran-Chan.  Doing so may get you to China alright…but  inside a body bag."</p><p>Ranma did a double take, looking at Akane smiling  there menacingly.</p><p>"I guess you're right Uc-Chan…" Ranma finally  said.  She turned back to her window,  looking at the clouds go soaring by.</p><p>"Those two make such a nice couple don't they?"  Ukyo asked Akane playfully.</p><p>Akane smiled.   "Yea…maybe we should have a wedding for those two."  She said, loud enough for Ranma to hear.</p><p>Ranma whipped around.  "What!  What are you two  tallkin' about?"</p><p>"Oh…but Ran-Chan…you looked so cute and peaceful  lying on Ryoga's shoulder.  You two suit  each other very well…"</p><p>"You…you have <i>got</i> to be kiddin' me!  We are both <i>guys</i> here!"</p><p>"Take another look at yourself Ranma…" Akane said,  laughing a bit.</p><p>Ranma looked down to her shirt.  He turned back to Ryoga, who was just  sitting there calmly.</p><p>"Don't expect me to do what you have in mind  Ranma.  I'm not like that."  Ryoga said coldly.</p><p>"W…what in the world are you talkin' about?" Ranma  demanded forcefully.</p><p>"You <i>were </i>on his shoulder for almost half the  trip Ranma."  Akane returned.</p><p>"Yea…and I heard you say, "Oh…Ryoga…how strong and  manly you are""</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened.  "N…No way I woulda said that!   You three musta lost your minds or somethin'!"</p><p>Akane and Ukyo just laughed to each other.  Ryoga smiled at Ranma.</p><p>"Feh… <i>so</i> un-cute…" Ranma said, turning around  and looking out his window angrily.</p><p>Akane and Ukyo started to talk to each other,  laughing and just having fun.  Ranma  resented their having fun…more than likely at his…her expense.</p><p>"Just listen to those two back there…" Ranma  started.  "All makin' fun of me and  stuff.  Well…that won't be a problem for  much longer…"</p><p>"Yes Ranma…those two seem to be pretty good  friends.  What happened?"</p><p>"I dunno, it just kinda happened gradually.  It started after Akane got out of the  hospital I know that…I really haven't asked her about it."</p><p>Ryoga looked down in his seat.  "I'm sorry about that Ranma…I accept full responsibility  for what happened. I can't apologize enough for…"</p><p>"Well…because of you…I finally got rid of Shampoo  and Cologne…" Ranma replied with a smile.</p><p>"W…what?  Was  that a "thank you" just then Ranma?"   Ryoga asked, surprised.</p><p>"Take it however you want to Ryoga…the fact is that  Cologne saved Akane.  I had to agree to  marry Shampoo as a result though.  So  Akane found out a new law…it was some sorta duel.  The winner would win me…of course you know how that turned out."</p><p>Ryoga just smiled, turning around to face the  front.  Maybe he had done something good  after all.  A few moments passed</p><p>"Hey Ryoga…you gettin' a strange feelin' about our  trip?  Like hesitation about going to  Jusenkyo?"</p><p>Ryoga turned to Ranma.  She had a serious look on her face.  She was feeling the same things he was.</p><p>"Uh…no Ranma…" Ryoga said, smiling nervously.  Ranma eyed Ryoga for a few moments, puzzled  over his sudden mood swing.</p><p>"Yea… I guess it's nothing."  Ranma said, returning Ryoga's smile.</p><p>She just stuck her head out the window for the  remainder of the trip.  The ocean  suddenly switched to land.  A smile grew  across Ranma's face.</p><p>"Hey…everyone.   We're in China!"  She said  excitedly.</p><p>"Look Ryoga!   The airport it just over there!"   Ranma said after a few minutes, hitting Ryoga on the shoulder without  taking her gaze from the window.   Ryoga's shoulder got softer…</p><p>Ranma turned around.  Akane was back in her seat, smiling.  "You ready Ranma?"  She  asked.</p><p>"Oh yea!"</p><p>"Ok everyone, gather around!"  Akane said, leaning over to Ryoga and  Ukyo.  Ranma joined her in her leaning.</p><p>"Now…we don't need to spoil the fact that we know  about Shampoo and Mousse's wedding, so don't mention it to them.  Also we need to find where they will be  meeting us.  Ranma…did you bring that  letter?  It may have directions on it."<br/>Ranma just smiled, saying  nothing.</p><p>"You forgot the letter…" Akane concluded.</p><p>Ranma nodded, smiling broadly.  The plane was on its final approach.  The guard person told them to sit back down  and move their seats to the upright position.   They did so.  "We will finish  this on the ground."  Akane said.</p><p>The plane landed, Ranma and Ryoga were looking  around, with wide eyes.  They burst out  the door, heading to baggage claims.   Akane and Ukyo just walked along, pretending not to know those two.</p><p>After a few minutes of scrambling, the group  retrieved thier bags; they were traveling light for their hike.</p><p>"Ok everyone."   Akane started.  "Don't let  Cologne and Shampoo figure out that we know what's going to happen.  I don't want their surprise ruined.  Now all we have to do is find them…"</p><p>"Not much of a plan Akane…don't tell them that we  know about their marriage and then just find 'em.  Wish I coulda thought of that."</p><p>Akane just rolled her eyes. "Split up everyone, we  will cover more ground that way."  Akane  said, starting off somewhere.  Ranma and  Ukyo took off in random directions, leaving Ryoga standing next to the baggage  claims terminal all alone.</p><p>"Oh man…" he said, looking around.  This was worse than the mall.</p><p>Suddenly, a strong, yet soft hand grabbed his.</p><p>"Hey Sugar…we almost forgot about you!"  Ukyo said to Ryoga, leading him off  somewhere.  "If we left you here…no  telling where you would end up…"</p><p>Ukyo and Ryoga searched around, still holding hands.</p><p>"Um…Ukyo…you can let go of me.  I'm not a child."  Ryoga said sternly.</p><p>"Whatever sugar.   You better not get lost though…" Ukyo said, taking off somewhere.  Soon they ran across Ranma and Akane, still  searching for Shampoo and Cologne.</p><p>"Any luck Ran-Chan?"  Ukyo asked</p><p>"No…nothin'.   Not even a…"</p><p>A voice interrupted Ranma.  "<i>Nihao</i> Ranma!"  It  called out cheerfully.  Everyone whipped  around, spying Shampoo waving her arms excitedly.  Cologne was next to her…and Mousse was there too, standing there  with his arms in his sleeves.  He was  smiling a bit.</p><p>"Ok everyone…remember…" Akane said in a whisper.</p><p>Shampoo came running up to the group.</p><p>"<i>Nihao</i>!   Shampoo happy to see everyone.   Great-grandmother hoped everyone would come with Ranma and Akane."</p><p>Cologne and Mousse appeared.</p><p>"It is good to see all of you again.  I knew Ryoga could not resist the urge to  come to China and I knew a good friend such as Ukyo would not be left  behind."  Cologne looked around at the  crowd of people around them.  "Let us  talk somewhere less crowded."  She said,  hopping off to the exit.  Everyone  followed her outside, where a warm spring like day was turning into afternoon.</p><p>"As you know…my granddaughter and I have caused you  two a great deal of trouble."  Cologne  started, looking at Ranma and Akane standing next to each other.  "But yet you two still offered to help us in  our time of need. I know when to admit defeat.   You don't get as good as I am by winning all the time.  Consider this trip as our apology and  everlasting thanks.  Remember us when you  splash yourself with the <i>nannichaun</i>."</p><p>"I am in your debt too, Ranma and Akane."  Mousse started  "With out your help I could have never got my true love back."</p><p>Shampoo eyed Mousse fiercely.  "Shampoo not so happy…only way Mousse win  was with cheating."</p><p>"Hey…wait a second.   Aren't you two in love?"  Ryoga  asked.  Ukyo promptly elbowed him in the  side, making him shut up.</p><p>"Yes…we are both madly—"Mousse started.  Shampoo shoved him out of the way.</p><p>"No we not!"   Shampoo demanded.  "Mousse played  dirty trick on Shampoo!  Is only reason  why Mousse think Shampoo likes him!"</p><p>Everyone was perplexed. Akane looked towards Ranma,  angrily.</p><p>"What was that about a wedding Ranma?"</p><p>"Hey…I only assumed that because…"</p><p>"Ranma…never assume!"  She said.  She turned to  Cologne.  "So…what is Shampoo talking  about?"</p><p>"Well…Shampoo lost the duel by forfeit.  The rules are quite simple.  Only a knockout or a forfeit will win the  duel.  Shampoo left the field of battle  before she finished with Mousse.  As a  result, I declared Mousse the winner."</p><p>"Well…I was almost right…" Ranma started.</p><p>"No Ranma…you were way off…" Akane said.</p><p>"Well…shall we get started?"  Cologne asked.  Everyone nodded.</p><p>Cologne hopped off, trailed by Shampoo and  Mousse.  Ryoga started off, staying close  to the group.  Akane and Ukyo were the  last to leave, talking about taking care of the campsites.</p><p>Ranma remained, standing there.  She took a deep breath.  She got that funny feeling again, but she  couldn't quite put her finer on it…It had something to do with Akane…was she  hesitant about taking her fiancée to Jusenkyo?</p><p>"I guess it's just that protective side of me" Ranma  assured herself.</p><p>"Hey slowpoke, you won't get cured lagging behind  like that!"  Akane called to her  playfully.</p><p>"Oh…hey wait up everyone!''  Ranma called out, running to catch up.  She soon forgot about that little feeling as  they neared the edge of a great forest.   On the other side of the forest, a long way away…would be Jusenkyo.</p><p>*****Ah, Gomennasai for the lateness of this update.  I had a minor set back. I had to go to Fayetteville to take my granddad to his surgery.  No, he's fine. In fact they let him out a day early. And I had to go on a Thursday,  which was one of my updating days. Things might start to get a bit random, so bare  with me here. So, only 5 chapters left…then, it's all over. I'm kind of sad.  This shall be the last plot arc for <u>Obsessions</u>. However, I am working on  <u>Just Give Me One More Chance</u> as we speak, I believe with my new editing  skills, I can turn it into something really good. Look for it right after I finish  <u>Obsessions</u>. Until then, until next we meet!*****</p>
