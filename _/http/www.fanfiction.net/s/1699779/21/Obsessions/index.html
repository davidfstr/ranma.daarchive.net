</div><p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter Twenty-One</p><p style="text-align:center;"><u>The Big Day</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane sat next to each other on the plane. It was time to go home. Akane sat up, looking outside the plane's window. They were loading the cargo. She examined everyone on the plane. Ukyo and Ryoga were talking about something. It would seem something had changed between those two. Shampoo and Mousse had changed too. They were riding the same plane as Ranma and Akane. Akane thought to herself. This trip changed more than just the curses. It had changed everything…everything changed, flipping itself on end. Ukyo was now a trusted friend, along with Ryoga being Ranma's friend. Even Mousse and Shampoo were on friendly terms. Cologne was plotting for them and not against them. She could still remember everything everyone tried to do, but she could easily forget that. Besides…Ranma and Akane had a wedding to look forward to.</p><p>The plane took off. Finally, time to go home. They had spent a little over two weeks outside and a nice soft bed would feel really nice right about now.</p><p>Akane looked over to Ranma. He was asleep. Akane smiled. She leaned back in her chair with a sigh, fully relaxing for the first time in what seemed like forever. She thought back to all that she did. She couldn't help but wonder if that was really her or not. The sights…she could remember them all. Her holding Ukyo over the spring, Ranma, leaning against that tree in pitiful shape, Ryoga on the receiving end of those daggers, Shampoo sitting there, holding Mousse, all those memories made her start to cry to herself. The fact she had hurt Ranma made her sob, audibly.</p><p>Ranma awoke, seeing Akane trying to keep her tears in. Ranma looked over to her. Akane just sat there, her gaze planted to the ground. She noticed she had awoken Ranma.</p><p>"Oh…sorry Ranma…I…uh…" Akane started, forcing a smile. Tears were still in her eyes.</p><p>"Hey Akane…its ok…"</p><p>"I know…but…they just won't stop."</p><p>Ranma placed an arm around her. Akane quickly burst into tears in Ranma's chest. Ranma moved his hand down her hair. Akane just needed to let all that out.</p><p>Ukyo looked over to Akane, crying like that. Ryoga was also concerned.</p><p>"Is Akane ok?" He asked</p><p>Ukyo nodded. "Yea Sugar…she just needs to let all that go. It must have been hard, realizing that you were hurting the one you loved on purpose."</p><p>"Yea…that's how I felt when I realized I could never break those two up. All I wanted to do was run away…it would seem fate lead me back to the Dojo just in time to get cured."</p><p>"Yea…all I wanted to do was help those two. I figured if I helped them, they could forgive me. But I was too late. They had already forgiven me a long time ago…"</p><p>Ryoga and Ukyo sat there, quietly for a few minutes.</p><p>"So…you gonna be there during the wedding?" Ukyo asked, smiling.</p><p>"Of course. I wouldn't miss that for the world."</p><p>Ukyo nodded, returning her gaze outside. Ryoga just looked at her…he got a feeling inside his chest. It was the same feeling her got when he first looked at Akane. He could never tell Akane now he felt back then…not that it would have mattered. He would not let that happened again! He would approach relationships like a real man once and for all!</p><p>Ryoga thought to himself a few moments. "No…never again will I sit on my words. I will ask Ukyo out to a date…as friends! I will not be afraid!"</p><p>"Uh…U-Ukyo?" He started.</p><p>"Hm? What is it?" Ukyo asked, turning to a very nervous Ryoga. He was fidgeting around and sweating a bit, smiling nervously.</p><p>"Uh…well…I was wondering…uh…w-what you were doing after Ranma and Akane got married…"</p><p>"Well…I suppose I would just go back to the shop and serve up my new Okonomiyaki recipes…"</p><p>Ryoga looked defeated. "Oh…so you're busy then…"</p><p>"Well…not really, it's just what I always do…why do you ask?"</p><p>Ryoga was stunned. Nervously he played with his words. "Uh well…I really don't h…have anything to do…and s…since…well we are kind of like friends… Well, it's like this…I was uh, w…wondering…"</p><p>Ukyo looked confused, eyeing Ryoga carefully. Ryoga got frustrated. He was crashing and burning. He would not let that happen again!</p><p>Ryoga concentrated, raising his battle spirit. He looked Ukyo dead in the eye…</p><p>"Ukyo! I was wondering it you would like to...to…g-go to the movies…after you are finished cooking!" Ryoga said loudly, bowing to Ukyo.</p><p>Ukyo was taken aback. Did Ryoga just ask her on a date? Well…its not like she was doing anything anyway.</p><p>"Sure Ryoga…meet me at my place any time after 6 pm." She said with a smile.</p><p>"R…really? You mean it Ukyo?" Ryoga said in disbelief.</p><p>"Sure sugar. We are friends after all, aren't we?"</p><p>Ryoga nodded happily. Ukyo smiled cutely and turned back to her window.</p><p>"I…I did it…" Ryoga said to himself, clenching his fist and smiling. "Never again shall Ryoga Hibiki be afraid of admitting his feelings!"</p><p>Now all he had to do was figure out how to get to Uc-Chan's…</p><p>Shampoo looked back to everyone. They were so happy, except that Ryoga character. He was acting a bit strange. Shampoo turned to Mousse, whom was looking out his window. She started to get a little sad. She had to say something.</p><p>Shampoo tapped Mousse on the shoulder. Mousse turned.</p><p>"Shampoo have something she need to say…"</p><p>"What is it, my beloved?"</p><p>"Shampoo…sorry…for treating you badly."</p><p>"It's ok. I cherished every moment I had with you, even if you were not acting like yourself."</p><p>Shampoo perked up. "You…forgive?"</p><p>"Of course!"</p><p>Cologne smiled to herself, hearing the exchange. After 300 years, she could spot love when she saw it.</p><p>The plane continued on: Everyone taking a well-deserved rest. A lot had happened and they all needed to get over the shock. Soon, they crossed into Japan and the plane landed safely, back on their home turf.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><u>Home At Last!</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane neared the archway of their new Dojo. They looked at each other. Shampoo, Mousse, and Cologne went to finish cleaning up the Kat Café. Ukyo had invited Ryoga to try some of her new cooking recipes, so they returned to Uc-Chan's</p><p>"You know…everyone is gonna be surprised at what has happened" Akane started.</p><p>"I don't know…I think the surprises are just beginning" Ranma returned with a smile.</p><p>The couple neared the front door. Ranma raised his hand towards it. Suddenly, the door burst open, revealing Soun and Genma, hugging their children hard.</p><p>"Oh…Ranma, Akane. I'm <i>so</i> glad you came back safely!" Soun said.</p><p>"Your father is proud of you boy! You too Akane!" Genma said after Soun</p><p>"Ok pops…both of you. Just give us a second to catch our breath. Oh…I got a surprise for ya" Ranma said, brandishing the Nannichaun jug at Genma. Genma's eyes widened as he reached out for the jug. He quickly doused himself in front of everyone, almost splashing Akane. He turned around, running to the back pond. Akane looked on, perplexed.</p><p>"Trust me…it's a curse thing…" Ranma said.</p><p>The couple entered, smelling the sweet smells of Kasumi's cooking. It was good to smell that again. It was so comforting. Nabiki came up to them.</p><p>"Hey you guys…<i>today</i> is the big day! Surprised?" Nabiki said, smiling her smile.<br/>Ranma and Akane's eyes widened. They looked to each other, stunned. They both smiled.</p><p>"You ready for this?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Yea!" Akane returned. "Lets do this!" She said excitedly.</p><p>"Good. Kasumi just called everyone. They should be here shortly."</p><p>"Everyone?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Kasumi peeked her head out the kitchen. "Yes Ranma…I called your friends over. They were very surprised. Won't it be fun having a wedding with all your friends next to you?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Yea…they <i>are</i> all my friends now…"</p><p>Suddenly, a strong, yet gentle set of hands grabbed Ranma. Ranma looked up. It was his mother.</p><p>"Oh Ranma, growing up to be such a man today. I heard you got cured!" Nodoka said with a big, warm smile. She poured a glass of cold water on Ranma's head. Everyone grew silent.</p><p>"Yea…I got somethin' to tell everyone." Female Ranma started.</p><p>Everyone halted their plans for the wedding. Akane sat next to Ranma. Ranma looked a bit defeated, but she had to explain herself.</p><p>"Ok everyone…it's like this…" Ranma started. "We got off the plane and arrived in Jusenkyo in about a week. Cologne pulled out a map, marking what each spring was. Unfortunately, the map got soaked and all the ink swirled. All we could read was the North side of Jusenkyo. That's where we fell in pops."</p><p>Genma nodded. Kasumi gasped.</p><p>"Oh my…how terrible."</p><p>"Yea…we were all kinda sad. We didn't know what to do. Ryoga said we should try to find the guide, but he wasn't there. So, to kill some time, Akane wanted to see how good she had gotten. We had a little match…"</p><p>"Hmm…so she fell into a spring I take it?" Genma said thoughtfully.</p><p>"<i>What</i>! Akane! Are you ok!" Soun demanded.</p><p>"Yea dad. Ranma cured me…but you should listen to his story…"</p><p>Soun calmed down, nodding and turning to Ranma.</p><p>"The guide came up after a few minutes. He told us that Akane had fallen into the "Spring of drown Oni". Before we could get him to tell us where the Nannichaun was, Akane knocked him out with a rock. Cursed Akane wanted only to fight, and she wasn't gonna listen to reason."</p><p>"Oh dear…but you still couldn't bring yourself to go all out against a woman could you?" Nodoka said.</p><p>Ranma nodded. "No I couldn't mom. I couldn't bring myself to hit her for real, even when I actually tried to. We tried the "Spring of drown girl" and even tried hot water. Akane was just to fast. We finally got her with the hot water though…but a sudden downpour hit …"</p><p>"So…what did you do Ranma?" Nabiki asked, interested.</p><p>"Well…Akane transformed again and I got a plan. I was gonna splash Akane with another cursed spring, but she used the Perfect <i>Tenrai Ryuujin no Hitoare</i> on me. That's why I didn't get cured. Besides… that kinda hurt…"</p><p>Akane blushed a little bit, noticing Genma look over to Ranma concerned</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"Well pops, Akane's attack evaporated all the spring water in the Nannichaun. The Guide had three jugs of it left. He used 'em to make curry. I was about to splash myself, when I remembered what I had told ya. Akane wasn't in a hurry for me to get cured so I decided to wait until the spring filled back up"</p><p>Everyone looked on, seeming to hang on Ranma's every word. She looked around questioningly</p><p>"What?" She asked</p><p>"Aren't you gonna finish your story Ranma? How did you cure Akane?" Nabiki said, smiling slightly.</p><p>" Oh yea…sorry, I though I was done. Anyway, that attack flung me over to the north side of Jusenkyo. That's when I remembered seeing that spring. Akane had dried up the "Spring of drown girl." But Cologne showed me on her map that one spring was empty. It was shaped kinda like a triangle. I knew that had to be the Akane-niichaun, since the map was 100 years old and Akane-niiichaun was pretty recent. So I lured Akane next to it and pushed her in. The rest is history."</p><p>"So…how did you lure Akane to that spring if she was not herself…" Soun asked.</p><p>Ranma looked to Akane. She was blushing, as was Ranma.</p><p>"Oh…well…I had my ways…" Ranma finally said.</p><p>"Oh…you must have had so much fun on your trip!" Kasumi said.</p><p>Ranma and Akane nodded. "Yea we did sister, but it's nice to be home."</p><p>Everyone got up; Nodoka approached Ranma, giving her a hug.</p><p>"You may still have your curse, but I still think you are a real man. Only a real man would have to courage to do what you did in protecting your wife like that."</p><p>Ranma smiled. "Thanks mom." She said, hugging her. "I missed you…I'm glad you made it here for our wedding."</p><p>"I wouldn't miss this for anything!" Nodoka assured her. She turned to Akane. "Now…let me hug my new daughter!"</p><p>Akane smiled, hugging her. "Thanks mom…this means a lot to Ranma."</p><p>"You make sure to take good care of him for me…"</p><p>Akane nodded.</p><p>Nodoka went back into the kitchen to help Kasumi. The rest of the housed hold dispersed, leaving Ranma and Akane at the dinner table.</p><p>"Oh!" Akane exclaimed. "<i>We</i> still have to get ready!" She exclaimed. Soun interrupted her from the back.</p><p>"Don't worry Akane. Everything is taken care of. All you have to do is get dressed."</p><p>Akane looked to Ranma. She took a deep breath. "Well…see you in a few hours." She said with a smile, running to her room. Ranma went to her former room, spying a sharp looking tuxedo. Soun and Genma entered the room, offering their opinions…and a hot kettle of water.</p><p>Akane entered her and Ranma's room. A beautiful white wedding dress hung there. Akane smiled. This was it…finally…after all this time. She hated to admit their fathers were right all along, but they did have more experience than she did. She drew closer to it, feeling its soft fabric. She started to get extremely nervous.</p><p>A sudden knock from her door interrupted any further though. It was Nodoka, Kasumi, and Nabiki. They were gong to help her with her dress. There was only one person missing…</p><p>"Don't worry Akane…I'm sure mother can see you now. I'll bet she is so happy…" Kasumi said, noticing her look around a bit.</p><p>Akane smiled. "Yea…"</p><p>"Well…let's get you ready!" Nabiki said with smile.</p><p>A few hours passed, Kasumi, Nabiki and Nodoka gazed upon Akane, dressed in that western style wedding dress. It was just like the one she wore on that day, so long ago. Everyone thought they should try the western style of marriage, seeing as that was the one that got ruined.</p><p>"You are just beautiful Akane" Nodoka said. Akane started to blush.</p><p>"Th…thanks…mom…"</p><p>"Well, we still have to finish cooking." She said, going out. Kasumi followed, looking one last time at Akane. Akane saw a tear of happiness come down her face. Kasumi smiled warmly. That made all Akane's nervousness disappear. Nabiki stayed with Akane. She started to smile slyly.</p><p>Akane looked over to her, wondering what she was plotting. Nabiki handed her a small elastic piece of silk. Akane eyed it, perplexed.</p><p>"What is this?" She asked.</p><p>"That goes around your thigh. I read about it in a book on western styles."</p><p>"Ok…what does it mean?"</p><p>"After your wedding, Ranma has to take if off…with his teeth." Nabiki said, winking.</p><p>Akane's eyes widened. "H…how far up does it go?"</p><p>Nabiki pointed.</p><p>Akane eyed the little silk thingy carefully. "I don't think so Nabiki…that's a little too close for comfort…if you know what I mean."</p><p>"Oh come on sis. This is gonna be the happiest day of your life…"</p><p>"I know…it's just that…well…that just seems so weird."</p><p>"No…that's supposed to help things along."</p><p>"I don't think we are gonna need help in <i>that</i> department." Akane said as a-matter-of-factly.</p><p>Nabiki smiled broadly. "Oh…ok…ready to dive in head first huh? Don't come on too hard to poor Ranma…you may send his head spinning…"</p><p>"Wait a second! I didn't mean it that way!" Akane returned.</p><p>"Sure sis, whatever. Be sure to knock his socks off. That's the best way to start a relationship like this. He'll remember tonight for years to come if you play your cards right…"</p><p>Akane just looked on. She desperately wanted to defend her words but just stood there, staring at the smiling Nabiki. Akane was at a loss for words…Nabiki had won, Akane just shook her head.</p><p>"<i>Ciao</i> Akane…" Nabiki said, turning to leave. She opened the door, turning one more time to Akane</p><p>"Who would have guessed you got married first. You are pretty lucky to find someone you want to spend the rest of your life with so early in yours. I guess you could say I'm a bit jealous."</p><p>Akane just smiled. "Thanks Nabiki."</p><p>"I'll call you when its time…until then, why not relax a bit?"</p><p>Akane nodded. Nabiki left her room, closing the door.</p><p>Akane looked at herself in the mirror, wearing that beautiful dress. She had never been so happy…or nervous in her entire life. A few minutes of quiet silence passed. She thought about what Nabiki was trying to insinuate…</p><p>"Remember for the rest of his life huh?" Akane said to herself…"I guess I should wear those…"</p><p>Ranma opened the door suddenly. Akane gasped, her heart jumping. Ranma was taken aback.</p><p>"Oh…sorry Akane…I was just lookin' for mom. I thought you would be downstairs…"</p><p>Akane calmed herself down. "It's ok Ranma…this is your room too."</p><p>"O…oh. I'll just leave then…" Ranma said, starting out.</p><p>"Ranma wait" Akane said. Ranma came back inside. Akane wanted to talk.</p><p>Ranma sat next to her in his black tuxedo.</p><p>Akane looked over to him…he was fidgeting nervously with his fingers…she remembered that…so long ago.</p><p>"So…uh…Ranma…you scared? We could always wait for a little while," She said.</p><p>"Yea kinda…but…"</p><p>"But what?"</p><p>"I've never felt so sure of my actions before. I know this is what I want. Unless you wanna wait…"</p><p>Akane smiled. "No…I want to do this too. It's a lot better than sitting awake in bed thinking about it. Maybe this way we would finally sleep through a whole night." Akane said jokingly.</p><p>"Yea really…so you were sleepless too huh?"</p><p>Akane nodded.</p><p>The couple sat there in silence for a few moments.</p><p>"Um…so Ranma…Japanese or western style wedding?" Akane said in a matter to kill time.</p><p>Ranma thought for a second. "I like you in the western style dress. You are real cute in it." Ranma's mind suddenly went back to the first attempted wedding. He finally figured out what Akane had meant when she said. "We didn't have to go through with this, but if you didn't you would be sorry."</p><p>Ranma <i>would</i> be sorry if he let the one he loved slip away. Akane knew a lot more than he did. He always seemed to be one step behind her…</p><p>"Uh…well Akane…I don't' think we are supposed to see each other until the actual ceremony. See ya in a little bit." Ranma said, rising.</p><p>"By Ranma…love you"</p><p>"Love you too Akane." Ranma returned, stepping out the door. He closed it softly behind him. Akane smiled. This would be the best day of her life.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><u>I Do!</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane stood at the altar. There was a giant white lacy tent overhead. Behind them on the lush green grass was the stone walkway they had each walked down. On either side were rows of comfy looking folding chairs. Ryoga, Ukyo, Shampoo, Mousse, and Cologne joined everyone there. Shampoo helped Nodoka and Kasumi cook the giant feast that was planned. Ukyo made special wedding day Okonomiyaki that was heart shaped with the words "Ranma and Akane forever". Even Dr. Tofu arrived, despite the fact he had talked directly to Kasumi. He was actually sitting next to her, seemingly lost somewhere, but remaining still. Maybe it was the suspense…</p><p>Ranma looked at the priest guy standing in front of him. He was going on forever. Ranma's heart was pounding. He had never felt so nervous, even when cats were around.</p><p>"Ok Ranma…this is it." Ranma thought to himself, not paying attention in the slightest. "You knew this was coming…you are ready. I wonder how Akane is feeling right now." Ranma turned his eyes to the ground. "Man…this…I've never felt like this before. Not even on that day the wedding got ruined. At least everything is settled now. It sure took a while though. I'll bet we go to Shampoo and Mousse's wedding in a few years or however long it took 'em. With any luck they won't go through what we did."</p><p>Ranma moved his eyes around; his head still focused forward, at least feigning attention to the priest guy. He glanced over to Akane. She was standing there, focused. Ranma smiled to himself. He had done good, finding a woman like her. Ranma thought back to the first time they met. That seemed like two different people. Ranma listened to the priest guy. It seemed like hours had passed.</p><p>"Geeze…this guy sure is taking his sweet time. Just get to the kissing part." Ranma said to himself. "Yea…I can't wait until this is all over. We would prolly…well I better not rush it tonight, although she looks do beautiful in that dress…I guess there is no denying it anymore…"</p><p>Akane listened to the priest guy before slipping into her world of thought.</p><p>"Ranma…you big dummy. Standing there all confident. If I didn't know better I would have said he had this planned the whole time, but I know you didn't. Everyone just kind of sprung this wedding on us. I thought we would at least wait a few days. For once, dad's plotting is put to good use."<br/>Akane turned her gaze to the ground, her heart started pounding. She could feel her hands sweating in those white gloves of hers.</p><p>"Oh man…I almost feel sick…" she started to herself. "I hope this guy hurries up, it's like the seconds are passing like hours."</p><p>Akane moved her eyes towards Ranma. Ranma caught her gaze. The both gave each other a reassuring smile.</p><p>"Everything will be ok Akane. After this, everything will be easy. Hopefully everything. I can't imagine anything else making us more nervous than this…"</p><p>The priest's speech neared its close. Ranma's hands started sweating. Akane sensed Ranma's discomfort, offering her hand to him. Ranma accepted the offer, grabbing Akane's hand, covered in that white glove. Good thing she had it on, it was hiding the fact that she was totally nervous. Akane clenched his hand tight…the moment of truth was drawing near.</p><p>"Do you, Ranma…take Akane to be your…"</p><p>A lump formed in Ranma's throat. He couldn't speak…this was just great. Only two little words, and he couldn't get them out. Akane might get mad…</p><p>Suddenly a large commotion came from behind the two. Ranma and Akane whirled, seeing two figures standing there.</p><p>"<i>Never</i>! Never shall I allow this!" Kuno shouted, brandishing his new metal sword. Kodachi laughed from next to him.</p><p>"Ranma-sama! What about your beloved Kodachi…"</p><p>"Not so fast!" Nabiki said, holding out her hand. Kuno searched around a bit, handing her an envelope. Kodachi did the same, and the two focused back on Ranma and Akane. Nabiki smiled and let them in. Even wedding crashers should bring presents…Ranma and Akane could put the money to good use…<i>after</i> they were married.</p><p>Ranma started to tense up. Akane clenched his hand tighter, trying to get him to calm down. Ranma was starting to get angry.</p><p>"Kuno…Kodachi…How <i>dare</i> you interrupt…"</p><p>"Silence Ranma Saotome! The will of heaven is slow but swift! I will strike you down once and for all!" Kuno said running down the walkway with Kodachi, brandishing her deadly ribbon.</p><p>Kuno stopped dead in his tracks, seeing two little yellow things dismember his metal sword. Ryoga stood up, taking a few more bandanas off and twirling them around. He stood in front of Kuno.</p><p>"You will not interfere Kuno…you wretch!" Ryoga said angrily. Ranma and Akane just looked on.</p><p>"What? How <i>dare</i> you! You will address me as Upperclassman Kuno!" He said, pulling out another sword. A flurry of daggers knocked the sword from his hand. Mousse landed right next to Ryoga, backing him up.</p><p>"Ranma Saotome has done much for me. His wedding was already ruined once…I will not allow you to ruin it again!"</p><p>Kuno smiled. "Ah…how can mere peons such as yourself ever comprehend the will of heaven? Heaven's retribution works through me! Ranma must be dealt with, only then can the world rest easy from his evil ways. After which, I shall date both Akane Tendou and my pigtailed girl."</p><p>Ryoga closed his eyes, turning his head.</p><p>Kuno smiled menacingly. "I see…you cannot hope to fight Tatewaki Kuno the Rising star of Furinkan High's kendo club, The Blue Thunder, …age seventeen. I will let you live, just this…"</p><p>Ryoga abruptly halted Kuno's little speech, punching him clear across the face. "Kuno…just shut up already!" He said, looking down at him and rubbing his fist.</p><p>Ukyo noticed this and smiled to Shampoo.</p><p>"Ranma-sama!" Kodachi said, running up beside Kuno, ignoring the pain he was in.</p><p>Ukyo and Shampoo jumped in front of her, taking fighting stances.</p><p>Kodachi laughed loudly. "Oh…how could you ever hope to stop me?"</p><p>"Kodachi, Ran-Chan doesn't like you. In fact, after that little stunt you just pulled, I'll bet he hates you now."</p><p>"Never will I allow my Ranma-sama to marry another but me! I will end this foolish charade!"</p><p>"Kodachi want to try to get passed Shampoo and Ukyo? Is welcome to, but won't succeed." Shampoo said, smiling menacingly.</p><p>"H…how dare you interfere! Out of my way!" Kodachi said, lashing out with her ribbon. The ribbon snapped, falling to the ground like rose petals in the fall.</p><p>Cologne stood on her staff, eying Kodachi.</p><p>"I don't know you to well…but I can clearly see you are not welcome here. Please leave this happy couple alone."</p><p>"W…what <i>is</i> that?" Kodachi asked, disgusted.</p><p>Cologne just stared at her.</p><p>Kodachi backed up next to Kuno. They eyed everyone there. Blocking their way was Cologne, standing in front of Ryoga, Mousse, Shampoo and Ukyo. Behind them still were Soun, Genma and Nodoka. Nabiki was standing in front of Ranma and Akane, making sure either one didn't lose his or her temper. Even Kasumi and Dr. Tofu joined the blockade.</p><p>"I don't believe I called you two…" she said. "Only Ranma and Akane's friends were invited." She said, in an unusually forceful tone.</p><p>"Y…yea…Ka…Kasumi is r…right!" Dr. Tofu managed.</p><p>Kuno and Kodachi smiled. Nodoka took a step forward. She was holding her giant Katana wrapped in cloth.</p><p>She stood in front of the two wedding crashers.</p><p>"Excuse me…I have never met you two. I am Ranma's mother. I would really like to see those two get married. So…if you don't mind leaving…" Nodoka started calmly. She let the cloth on the handle of her blade slip down a little, revealing the sword half pulled out. The blade looked extremely sharp.</p><p>Kuno and Kodachi took a step back.</p><p>"It seems we are a bit outmatched. No matter. You cannot stop the will of the heavens! Rest assured, justice will be served. Ranma, the vile curr shall meet his fate at my hands" Kuno asserted, turning and walking off into the distance slowly. Kodachi bounded off, leaving a trail of rose petals and saying something about seeing Ranma later.</p><p>Everyone looked surprised at Nodoka. She smiled, returning to her seat.</p><p>"Wow…you have some mother there Ranma." Akane said.</p><p>"Yea…didn't you notice how she was always lookin' for me a pops? When she wants somethin' she makes sure it happens. Determined is the word…I guess."</p><p>Ranma and Akane just looked on, stunned. Their friends had protected them…such a kind gesture. The priest cleared his throat, getting Ranma and Akane's attention.<br/>"Do you Ranma…take Akane, to be your lawfully wedded wife? Through richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live?"</p><p>That lump returned. Ranma had completely forgot about this.</p><p>"D…damn it! I forgot about that guy! I…it's like I'm frozen. Come on. Just two words, then it will be over…"</p><p>He took a deep breath. "I…do!" Ranma said, expecting to see Akane's smile.</p><p>She just stood there. She nudged him as if to help him spit it out. Ranma did a double take on the situation. The words just wouldn't come out. He had gone mute out of nervousness. He swallowed, feeling everyone's eyes on him.</p><p>"Great…now what am I gonna do? No, I'm not gonna have this. I love Akane too much to let two stupid words get between me and her!"</p><p>"I…I do!" He yelled forcefully. Akane smiled at him. It only came out as a whisper…a whisper everyone heard. Ranma returned her smile. Now it was Akane's turn. Ranma smiled at her plight.</p><p>"Do you Akane …take Ranma, to be your lawfully wedded husband? Through richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live?"</p><p>Akane lowered her head. She had been practicing that line for a long time in her mind, especially during the trip to Jusenkyo. Her heart started racing, raising her blood pressure so high she got a little dizzy.</p><p>"No…no fainting today. That would be the easy way out." She said to herself. She suddenly realized what Ranma had gone through first hand. Those words seemed elusive. She looked the priest in the eye, determined. She focused on those two little words…</p><p>"I have waited too long for this and suffered too much…this is the end of it!"</p><p>"I do…" She said in an unusually calm tone.</p><p>The world lifted off her chest just then. All that weight she carried for some time. Ranma must have felt the same.</p><p>"I now pronounce you Husband and Wife…you may kiss the bride''</p><p>The couple smiled. Finally, it was time for the good part. They turned to each other. Each seemed to leap into their lover's arms, passionately kissing their new partner. The world seemed to stand still for everyone that watched. It was almost like they couldn't believe it was happening.</p><p>Soun and Genma burst into tears of happiness, as did Kasumi and Nodoka. Even Cologne found herself lost in the moment, a tear rolling down her face. She had atoned for her sins against those two, and that was her reward, a new son-in-law, a new grand-daughter and seeing Ranma and Akane, together at last.</p><p>Ranma and Akane let go of each other, even though they could have stayed like that forever. Akane turned to the crowd, hurling her bouquet of flowers in the air. Shampoo and Ukyo both ran up, jumping. Shampoo caught the bouquet and looked triumphantly to Cologne.<br/>Ryoga saw Ukyo jump after the flowers…was she planning on getting married sometime soon? Ryoga didn't know…</p><p style="text-align:center;"><u>Time to Celebrate!</u></p><p>Ranma sat next to Akane at the long table covered in a soft white tablecloth. He eyed the new ring on his finger.</p><p>"Like that boy?" Genma asked, beaming with fatherly pride.</p><p>"Yea pops…but it's gonna take a bit of getting used to. I never wore a ring before."</p><p>"Trust me, you'll get used to it son!" Soun returned.<br/>Ranma just smiled.<br/>Everyone sat there talking and reminiscing. It was time for Ranma and Akane to cut the cake.</p><p>Ranma and Akane neared the cake. It was covered in white frosting and had four different sizes. Kasumi put light purple trim around each round layer, with a few blue flowers and green leaves that Shampoo helped construct. On top, were little figures: The guy had a black pigtail and the girl had beautiful short hair.</p><p>Ranma grabbed the knife, a large looking one. Akane placed her hand around Ranma's</p><p>"Hey…speech!" Nabiki yelled.</p><p>"Yea…let us hear a few words from the newly married couple!" Genma said, rising. Everyone agreed. Ranma and Akane smiled nervously. All eyes were on them again.</p><p>"Well…uh…I just wanna say…" Ranma started. "Doesn't Akane look just so cute in that dress? I'm a pretty lucky guy to have her around. I mean…it almost didn't happen. I guess not a lot of people get second chances. I'm just happy everything turned out all right. I love you Akane!"</p><p>Akane looked up to Ranma, tears of joy in her eyes. Akane almost swore she saw a tear of happiness in Ranma's eyes.</p><p>"Well I…I love you too Ranma!" Akane said simply, looking into his eyes.</p><p>"Ok you two, save it for later, people are waiting to eat." Nabiki said with a smile.</p><p>Ranma and Akane sliced the cake, taking a very large piece. The cake was perfect…</p><p>The party went on until the late evening. Ryoga would stay with Ukyo…he still couldn't find his way home. Shampoo and Mousse would stay in town for a few more days before returning to China. Kasumi started cleaning up with Dr. Tofu's help…barely. Nabiki pulled Akane over to her, whispering a few things to her. Akane got a bit tense but listened nonetheless. Besides Akane had no idea how to approach the situation.</p><p>"So…uh, Nabiki…any suggestions?' Akane asked, looking over her shoulder. Ranma was talking with Ryoga and Mousse as they were starting to leave.</p><p>Nabiki smiled. "Just a few sis…for a price?"</p><p>Akane rolled her eyes. "Oh come on Nabiki. I could figure this stuff out…eventually. Besides, don't you have enough yen already?"</p><p>"No…that's not what I want…" she returned slyly.</p><p>"So…what is it you want then?"</p><p>Nabiki smiled, putting an arm around her little sister and started walking away from everyone.</p><p>"Well sis…<i>Auntie</i> Nabiki has a nice ring to it doesn't it?" She finally said, sure no one was around.</p><p>Akane's eyes widened…but she just nodded…the two talked for a few minutes before rejoining Ranma and company.</p><p>After a few minutes, Akane returned. Soun and Genma walked away with Kasumi and Nabiki, towards the town.</p><p>"So…what's goin' on?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Nabiki told me…they are going somewhere for two weeks. I guess this is our honeymoon."</p><p>Ranma smiled. "Great! Now we can finally relax…"</p><p>"Don't worry Ranma…Nabiki said they won't spy on us. I guess they want us to get used to running the Dojo by ourselves…"</p><p>Ranma thought for a few minutes. "Yea…but who's gonna cook? I guess I could…I mean…"</p><p>"Don't worry Ranma…Kasumi left us a surprise." Akane said, going inside the dojo. Ranma followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>He looked around. "I don't see any changes…"</p><p>Akane smiled, opening the cupboard where Kasumi kept all her spices. They had little different colored stickers on them. Ranma looked on, confused.</p><p>"Look at this Ranma!" Akane said, holding up a cookbook with a little heart drawn on the front. It was a gift from Kasumi.</p><p>Inside were recipes: The ingredient to be used and the amount to use it. The ingredients were written in different colors…</p><p>"Oh…Kasumi color coded all the spices and stuff!" Ranma said happily.</p><p>Akane nodded. "Yea…isn't that great? Now I won't mess up a dish by putting the wrong stuff. Kasumi also told me not to change the recipe in the slightest, even if I think it will be better."</p><p>"Oh that's good. Can't wait to try your improved cookin'"</p><p>Akane smiled. "Well…let's get out of these clothes. How about a little TV to end the night?"</p><p>"Sounds good to me Akane!" Ranma said. They changed from their wedding outfits, setting down in Kasumi's room. She would make sure they would last forever.</p><p>"Man…this is great!" Ranma said, sitting next to Akane. "I just can't stop smilin'. This is so cool!"</p><p>"I know what you mean Ranma…the rest of our lives…I look forward to what's gonna happen!"</p><p>"I love you Akane!" Ranma said happily. Those words seemed to come out so easily all of a sudden.</p><p>"Love you too Ranma!" Akane said, giving him a kiss. They two just sat there watching TV for a few moments. Akane thought to herself, her mind wandering like it sometimes would.</p><p>"Well…nothing left now…except…" Akane stiffened a bit. "You knew this was going to happen Akane. I guess I should just trust Nabiki. I hope she knows what she is talking about…"</p><p>"Hey Ranma!" Akane said. "I have one more gift for you upstairs. It's in our room. Wanna go check it out?"</p><p>"Sure…" Ranma said with a smile.</p><p>Akane went up to their room. Something came up from her chest. It was fear…she was almost petrified, but desperately kept it inside. "All I have to is do what Nabiki told me…she said the rest would come easy…no use putting it off any more."</p><p>"Ok Ranma…turn around. It's a surprise." Akane said. Ranma did so, perplexed. What in the world was about to happen?</p><p>Akane narrowed her eyes. "Ok! He will remember this night for the rest of his life!" She said to herself, pushing her fear out of her. She thought for just a few more seconds. Her heart was pounding and her fingers were shaking. She was ready. According to Nabiki and Ukyo, Ranma had been waiting for this. It was only appropriate for her to make the first move. Besides, she wanted to…</p><p>"O…ok Ranma…y-you can turn around now." Akane said, nervously.</p><p>Ranma turned, his eyes widened. Akane was wearing a familiar looking outfit…or rather, pieces. Ranma had seen that in that lingerie catalog he looked through on his birthday…it was blue color, to match her dark shade of hair. The pieces seemed to fit in just the right places.</p><p>"N…Nabiki said I should…so when I went to the store I got this…I hope you like it…"</p><p>Ranma just eyed Akane there. She was so beautiful he had to take her in his arms.</p><p>"I think it looks great Akane!"</p><p>Those words made Akane's heart race. She saw Ranma's face nearing hers. They kissed each other, passion burning in both. Ranma released Akane, unsure of where to go form there.</p><p>"So uh…" Ranma started, embarrassed at the situation he found himself in.</p><p>Akane looked into Ranma's eyes. Something moved inside her. This time, she would just follow her feelings. She silenced that little voice in her head and grabbed Ranma, kissing him again, holding his body close to hers. Ranma placed his arms around Akane. They both knew from that point…what the other wanted…and where to go.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><u>Two Weeks Later…</u></p><p>Everyone sat down, eating the first breakfast since Akane and Ranma's marriage.</p><p>"So…did you two have a good time?" Soun asked</p><p>"Yea dad…it was pretty…interesting." Ranma returned. He glanced at Akane. Akane smiled, shyly.</p><p>Soun and Genma nodded. Everyone continued to eat breakfast.</p><p>Silence passed for a few minutes. Something seemed to be bothering Akane. The silence was getting to her. She felt like all eyes were on her. She didn't even eat that much…It was like…tension.</p><p>Oh…what the heck!</p><p>Akane set her chopsticks down. She looked over to her father seriously. Everyone noticed.</p><p>"Dad…I…think I'm pregnant…" Akane said, not sure how to get it out…</p><p>Akane heard a <i>crack</i>. Ranma was sitting there, holding two broken chopsticks. He was just staring off into space.</p><p>"Ranma? Ranma! Did you hear what I said?" Akane asked.</p><p>Nabiki went over to Ranma, waving her hand in front of his face.</p><p>No response.</p><p>"I think he heard you sis."</p><p>"So…why isn't he happy? I though he would be…"</p><p>"Oh dear…it seems Ranma was so stunned by your words that he passed out …" Kasumi offered.</p><p>Soun and Genma laughed heartily. Those words brought back so many memories.</p><p>Nabiki stealthily approached Akane. "So…you did what I said huh?" She whispered.</p><p>Akane nodded, a bit embarrassed.</p><p>Nabiki winked. "See…he will never forget that night. Not in a million years."</p><p>Akane smiled. She turned to Ranma, who was still mortified.</p><p>"Ranma you big dummy…is he gonna be ok?"</p><p>Soun laughed. "Of course he will be Akane. Being a parent is a big deal. Just give Ranma some time to get used to the idea. I'm sure he will be overjoyed to hear that from you."</p><p>"Well…I don't see what the big deal is. He shouldn't have fainted like that…Honestly…"</p><p>"Trust me Akane. Nine months from now, you'll see why Ranma is petrified like he is now."</p><p>Akane looked one more time at Ranma, still stunned. Akane placed her hand on her stomach. Nothing yet…</p><p>"Oh…we should go to the doctor to have an official test done!" Kasumi said. Akane smiled and got up, walking with her sister to the doctor's office. Soun and Genma started a game of GO. Nabiki went upstairs, leaving Ranma speechless.</p><p>Akane and Kasumi returned a few hours later. Akane <i>was</i> pregnant. She approached Ranma, whom had fallen to the ground by then.</p><p>"Ranma…hey Ranma! Get up!" She said, smiling down at him.</p><p>Ranma blinked.</p><p>"A…Akane? What happened? What'cha smilin' for?"</p><p>"Me and Kasumi got back from the Doctor. You're not gonna believe it! I'm pregnant Ranma! Isn't' that great?"</p><p>Ranma's jaw dropped, as did his head…straight into the floor. Akane narrowed her eyes.</p><p>"Honestly…I would have thought the person that would withstand blows that could topple buildings would have had more resolve than that."</p><p>"Just give him time Akane…he doesn't look so well…" Kasumi said. "Oh…we must start preparing. I have some of your old baby clothes in the attic!"</p><p>"And what if it's a boy?"</p><p>Genma smiled. "Just you let me and my wife handle that! I'm sure Nodoka has Ranma's old clothes. I better call her and tell her the good news."</p><p>With that, the house dispersed, leaving Akane staring down at Ranma. She knelt down beside him, running her hand through his hair. He was out cold. Maybe this was a bigger deal than she thought…</p><p>"Ranma…you big dummy." She said with a warm smile.</p><p>Eventually, Ranma woke up, overjoyed at being a father. Now, the only thing left…was enduring nine months of Akane's mood swings. Hopefully…he could survive. It wouldn't be that bad…</p><p>Would it?</p>The End<p style="text-align:center;">A fanfic brought to you by:</p><p style="text-align:center;">Elidibus</p><p>Ah. Well, that's it. No surprises, just clean cut and simple. Maybe too simple? Hey, give me a break, it's the first story I actually wrote an ending to. I think it works. So, that's it. This one is done. I wanna give a shot out to all you people that read this! Thanks for your input guys! It's really helpful! You have no idea. So…what's next for Elid? Well, my next fanfiction. <u>Just Give Me One More Chance</u>. The second fanfiction I completed. In this one, my style is a bit more mature, but still lacks in some places, especially when compared to today. However, I'm doing a fairly lengthy edit on it, so it should shine even brighter. Want a summary? Well, here's the plot. Be warned, this contains spoilers, but again, I suck at all this summary stuff. If you wanna be surprised at the events in it, skip this part</p><p>#####6 months after the failed wedding, we rejoin Ranma and Akane. Things are pretty much normal, until a mysterious woman comes out of nowhere and starts to wreak havoc on the Nermia crew. We soon find out that she's out for Ranma, for one reason and another. Akane is not going to stand for that, and joins Ranma on his quest to defeat her, when something tragic happens. Now she's stuck in a world where Ranma and her aren't engaged. In fact, they hardly know each other. What the hell is going on? What caused her to be in this new place? It's so similar, but it's totally different. And how is she going to get back, so that she can be with Ranma again, forever?######</p><p>Ok. That's about the best I can do, without spoiling the major parts. Just…one question. It's about the Musk Dynasty. I can't remember and can't find an answer. Maybe someone else can, but I heard that everyone in the Musk Dynasty was male, because when they were born, they were baptized in the Nannichaun. Or was that some one else. Any help would be appreciated. If nothing else, I'll just edit that part out. You can mail me at , of just post an answer in my reviews. Thanks guys, for everything. I don't know when that story is going up, but it will be, and unlike this one, it will be the first time it's seen the light of day. I hope you enjoyed Obsessions, and look forward to seeing all your faces when I post <u>Just Give Me One More Chance. </u>Until next we meet!</p></p>
