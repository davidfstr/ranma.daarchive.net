</div><p>Chapter Six</p><p><u>As the  Fates Would Have It</u></p><p>Ranma awoke, hungry.  That was a nice sleep.  He  got up and went down stairs, eager to start off the day with Kasumi's  cooking.  He reached the table and  looked around.  Akane wasn't here.  No doubt she was off training.</p><p>"Oh, Good morning Ranma!" Kasumi said.  "Nabiki has already left for school.  Akane already ate.  She got up rather early today.   Won't you go help her train a bit after breakfast?  She could use a coach as good as you."</p><p>Ranma looked over to Kasumi.  "Well, I suppose I should go and see what I  can do, even though she yelled at me for not plantin' her face into the  ground."</p><p>"That's the spirit Ranma!  Akane is so lucky to have you.   I can't wait until you two get married, you will be so happy."</p><p>"Ranma" Genma demanded.  "You really should have taken that spar more seriously.  Shampoo is a very skilled martial  artist.  Would it have hurt you to be a  little more aggressive?"</p><p>"Pops, there's no way I'm hitting a lady for  real.  I went out of my way as it was; I  did hit her a few times.  Not hard of  course."</p><p>"I'm sorry Ranma, I understand your values.  I was just worried that Akane may not be  able to beat Shampoo."</p><p>Ranma was stunned.   First he was worried about him now he's apologizing?  "Well, I should go check up on her, after  breakfast anyway."  He said, finishing  his breakfast.</p><p>He soon entered the training hall.  Akane was there; she had just finished her  morning jog.</p><p>"You know, Akane is kind of cute wearing those  shorts, in a tomboyish fashion of course."   Ranma thought to himself.</p><p>Akane turned around, noticing Ranma was there,  watching her.</p><p>"Ranma…" she said.   "What do you want now?"</p><p>"Oh, I was just checkin' on ya.  You have been going kinda hard with all this  training.  You know, you're kinda cute  when you wear those shorts"</p><p>Akane  blushed, smiling slightly. She wasn't used to compliments from Ranma.  "Uh…thanks."  She said, diverting her eyes from him.</p><p>Ranma grabbed Akane's hand, they looked a lot better  and the redness had died down.  "Hey Akane,  mind telling me what you were doing when you did this."  He asked, holding Akane's hand in front of  her face.</p><p>Akane got defensive.  "So that's what you were doing. Trying to force information out  of me?"</p><p>"N…No! I was just worried…"</p><p>"Well it's none of your business!"</p><p>"Geeze, all I said was you looked cute and then all  of a sudden you explode on me.  Guess  that shows how <i>cute</i> you really are."</p><p>Akane threw a punch at Ranma, Ranma tilted  backwards, avoiding the blow.  Akane  tried to hit him with a fast kick, Ranma jumped in the air, placing his hands  on Akane's leg and flipping over her, landing a few feet away.</p><p>"Come on Akane, you gotta do better than that" Ranma  said, standing calmly with his hands in his pockets.</p><p>Akane clenched her fist, about to charge Ranma.  She stopped short of him, turning around in  disgust.  "What's the use Ranma, even if  I attack you, you won't take me seriously."</p><p>"What seems to be your problem Akane?"</p><p>"You don't seem to be taking this duel seriously is  my problem.  It's like…you don't want me  to win or something."  Akane suddenly  got quiet.  She turned her back to  Ranma.</p><p>"What are you takin' about Akane?  Haven't' we been through his argument  before?  Besides, I <i>do</i> want you  to win.  That's the only way I see of me  gettin' rid of Shampoo."</p><p>Akane whirled around.  "Well then, <i>act</i> like it Ranma!"  She said, taking a fighting stance.</p><p>"Geeze…I guess I could step it up another notch…"  Ranma stood ready, his hands in his pockets.</p><p>The training door slid open suddenly, with a creak.  Akane and Ranma looked over to see Ukyo,  carrying a few small boxes.  She seemed  a lot happier than yesterday.</p><p>"Hey you two.   Kasumi said you would be back here.   Just to let ya know, I'm on your side!"   Ukyo said, smiling.</p><p>"Oh, hey Uc-Chan.   What are you tallkin' about?"   Ranma asked, confused.</p><p>Ukyo approached him, setting the boxes down.  "Well Ran-Chan, something hit me a few days  ago, after I…well…acted like a fool.  I  had hurt you and Akane pretty bad that day, I just thought you two would have your  normal argument and that would be it.   It was then I realized, that, if I had really loved you, I wouldn't have  done that to you.  I guess its fate or  something that brought you two together.   Besides, Akane won fair and square, right sugar?"  Ukyo turned to Akane, smiling.</p><p>Akane returned a serious look.  "Ukyo…"</p><p>"Uc-Chan.   That means you're…giving up on me?"</p><p>"Well, you could say that.  You two make the perfect couple.   I should have noticed by the way you two were always fighting."</p><p>"Well we wouldn't fight all the time if Akane wasn't  such a tomboy."  Ranma said calmly.</p><p>"You idiot, you're the one acting macho all the  time, what with your calm cool and collected ways."</p><p>"Oh, speaking of macho, you really should look in  the mirror before saying that."</p><p>The couple narrowed their eyes at each other.  Ukyo, wanting to preserve peace, stepped in  between them.  "Ok you two, don't we  have training to go through?  I brought  some Okonomiyaki with me to help you out.   Don't worry it's on the house."</p><p>"Ok Uc-Chan, we'll eat later, I just had breakfast."</p><p>Akane thought for a minute.  "Hey Ukyo, you said you're on our side  right?  Does that mean you want me to  win against Shampoo?"</p><p>"Well yea, I never really liked her any way.  She would cheat all the time with her  potions and such; besides, I can't stand the thought of seeing Ranma with her."</p><p>"Thanks Ukyo.   You really are a good friend.   Anyway, what I was getting at was; would you help me train a little  bit?  Ranma seems to think this is all  some sort of game."</p><p>Ranma looked over to her,  "I told ya, I can't fight for real against a girl.  It's against my nature."</p><p>Akane ignored Ranma, angered at him.  Ukyo nodded.  "Sure thing sugar, let's see how good you've really gotten."  Ukyo went to the opposite side of the hall,  taking a fighting stance.  Akane charged  her.  The fight had begun.</p><p>Ranma sat on the sidelines, watching the spar.  He found himself drawn to Akane  somehow.  She seemed to get cuter over  the last few days and the fact that she was wearing those short shorts helped  out a little.</p><p>"Wow, I've never seen Akane move like that.  She's taking this thing pretty  seriously."  Ranma thought to himself,  almost in a trance.  "So cute…if only  she didn't act so violent all the time.   I guess this wedding thing could work out after all.  Maybe with all my fiancées gone she would  mellow out a little.  I guess I've been  acting kinda careless lately.  Well I  can't beat on my fiancée.  Maybe I  should apologize to her for acting that way…"</p><p>Ranma continued to watch the duel, Akane making  graceful movements and leaps to avoid Ukyo's attacks.  "She <i>is</i> cute!   Maybe I really do love her.   Maybe that's why I'm so concerned about her feelings.  I already told her once…kinda on accident.  Maybe I should tell her for real.  That would show her.  Maybe she would stop yelling at me after  that.  Now to pick the right time…"</p><p>Ranma took his eyes off the duel, concentrating on  just how to go about telling Akane how he felt…for real this time.</p><p>"Ah ha!"   Ranma shouted, snapping his fingers.   "I have the perfect way.  All I  need is a gift…" Ranma suddenly noticed that Akane and Ukyo had stopped  fighting, and were looking at him with confused faces.</p><p>"Ah ha! What?"   Akane asked.</p><p>"Uh, oh…it's nothing Akane, I just…figured out something.  That's all."</p><p>"Well, what did you figure out?"  Ranma winced.  He thought for a brief second.</p><p>"Well we all have our secrets, don't we Akane?"  Ranma finally said, pointing to her hands.   It was then that Ukyo noticed Akane's hands were kind of red.</p><p>"Yea Akane, what happened?"  She asked, taking one of her hands and  looking at it.  "This looks like it was  done by fire, I know burns when I see them.   You get burned a lot in my kinda business."</p><p>Akane stood there; all eyes were on her.  "Oh, I was just helping Kasumi with the  cooking the other day.  I ruined it as  usual."  Ranma turned to her.  It wasn't like Akane to admit her flaws like  that…unless she was very mad.</p><p>Akane quickly changed the subject.  "Well, Ukyo shall we continue?"  Ukyo need not be asked twice.  She was having a hard time keeping up with  Akane's moves, but she did feel like she owed her a big debt.</p><p>Ranma continued to watch the spar, his mind going in  and out of marriage.</p><p>"Ok you two.   I think that about does it for me."   Ukyo said after an hour or so.   Her hair was all messed up and she had a few bruises.  "I closed the store for the morning but now  it's almost lunch time.  Well, see you  all later.  I'll drop by again in a  while.  Akane, don't be fooled by  Shampoo, she is a lot smarter than she appears."</p><p>With that,  Ukyo left, leaving the <i>Okonomiyaki</i> with Ranma and Akane.  Akane grabbed the boxes and sat next to  Ranma, handing him one.  The couple sat  and ate quietly.  This time Ranma broke  the silence.</p><p>"Hey, Akane, those were pretty good moves out  there.  I'm starting to notice a big  improvement."  Akane smiled to him.</p><p>"Well, I can't stop now.  I'll just take a small break, then I'll go back at it."</p><p>"You know…I was thinkin'…maybe I <i>could</i> help  you train.  I suppose if I were a girl  there would be no problem."</p><p>"Oh, that's ok Ranma.  I kinda wanted to train alone for a while…"</p><p>"Oh," Ranma said, a bit shocked at Akane's  refusal.  "Well have it your way  then.  I'm goin' out, I have some stuff  do to."  With that, Ranma got up and  left the hall, heading into town.  Akane  thought to herself.</p><p>"What is that Ranma doing now?  Well this'ill give me a chance to practice a  bit more.  I almost have it…if only I  could keep my hands from getting burned.   I have got to come up with a better excuse that what I was using.  Maybe I'll go somewhere a little less  crowded."  Akane rose to her feet, going  up to her room and getting her paper bag.   She would go to that abandoned lot a few blocks down. All that was there  were a few trees and one other empty house.   That would give her a good chance to practice her moves.</p><p>Ranma walked down the main street in Nermia.  His hands were in his pockets, as he calmly  looked around at all the shops.  "I  wonder where that place is?  Who would  have guessed I would have a need of such a place."  Ranma continued his search for the right shop.  He walked down that street for what seemed  like hours.  "Ah, there it is…did I pass  it the first time?"  Ranma asked  himself, entering an elaborate shop.</p><p>"Hello there kind sir, how can I help you?"  The man at the counter asked.  Ranma looked around at all the items on  display.</p><p>"Um…you have any…<i>engagement</i> rings?"  Ranma asked softly.</p><p>"Why yes sir, what a happy occasion!  Follow me and I'll show you where we keep  them all."</p><p>Ranma walked to a counter on the other side of the  store.  There were a lot of rings in  there, some looked just cheap but others looked very expensive.</p><p>"Take your time sir," The man at the counter said.</p><p>Ranma looked carefully, visualizing Akane's soft  hands and fingers.</p><p>"Ah!"  He  exclaimed.  "That one is perfect!  It matches the sparkle in her eyes, when  she's smiling any way."</p><p>The man at the counter opened the case and let Ranma  hold the ring.  It <i>was</i> the  perfect one.  It was a gold ring, with a  small diamond in the middle and a few smaller ones going around.  The diamonds glittered perfectly.  Ranma had to get this.  Akane would be so surprised…</p><p>"Yes, this is the best one, how much for it?"</p><p>The man at the counter got out a large book and flipped  through the pages.  "Well, looks like  that one is 35,000 yen, price with tax."</p><p>Ranma nearly fainted.  Where was he going to get 35,000 yen in three days?</p><p>"Oh…could you save it for me?  I didn't expect it to cost that much.  I would hate for someone to buy it."</p><p>"Sure young man.   I can keep it for you until the store closes tonight."</p><p>"Thank you."   Ranma said distantly, exiting the shop.   His mind weighed heavily on his heart.   "Man…35,000 yen.   I have to get  that ring though; it's the perfect one. That would sure show Akane; maybe she  would stop being so un-cute."</p><p>Ranma returned to the Dojo, knowing what he must do.</p><p>"Hey Kasumi?   Where's Nabiki?"</p><p>"Oh, Hello Ranma.   Nabiki is in her room.  She said  something about audits…" Ranma rolled his eyes.  This would be messy.</p><p>Ranma knocked softly on her door.  "Hey Nabiki, you in there?"</p><p>"Yes, what do you want Ranma?"</p><p>"I want to talk business."</p><p>The door opened, revealing an interested  Nabiki.  "So what have you come to  discuss Ranma?  You don't seem like the  dealing type."</p><p>Ranma went and sat by her desk.  Nabiki lay on her bed, smiling.</p><p>"Well, this is pretty painful, so I'm just gonna cut  to the chase.  I need to borrow 35,000  yen.  It's a personal matter."</p><p>Nabiki's smile got a bit wider.  "Ok Ranma, what kind of collateral you  got?"</p><p>"Uh…collateral?   I don't have any of that…"</p><p>'Hmmm…" Nabiki said, flipping through her  paperwork.  "Your credit isn't as good  as it should be.  I don't know if I can  approve your loan request."</p><p>"Geeze, Nabiki.   I came to ask for a hand, person to person.  Not from the First National Bank of Nabiki."</p><p>"Well Ranma, what is it for?  35,000 yen is a lot of money."</p><p>"Well…it's kinda a secret…" Ranma said weakly.</p><p>Nabiki thought for a second "Well sure, I'll let you  borrow the money.  But, I'm running kind  of low on pictures, if you know what I mean."</p><p>Ranma shook his head.  "You have a deal Nabiki."</p><p>"Good, I've picked out some lingerie for you to  wear."</p><p>"What!  You  didn't say anything about wearing lingerie!"</p><p>"Does that mean you don't want the money?"</p><p>"Fine, have it your way.  Do whatever you want with me.   I just need the money right now."</p><p>"You have yourself a deal Ranma.  I'll get the interest rates finalized for  you in the morning."  Nabiki said,  reaching in a box and pulling out seven 5000-yen notes.</p><p>Ranma took the money and ran back down town.  Had he stayed any longer it would have cost  him an arm and a leg.  Maybe he would  have had better luck trying to sell Akane's cooking at bake sales.  Well he did get the money; that was enough  for him.  He would deal with Nabiki  later.</p><p>He entered the jewelry store, the man greeting him  again.  Ranma presented the notes and  walked away a few minutes later with a small gift-wrapped box.  It was a very nice paper, shiny blue with a  small yellow ribbon.  Ranma carried it  in an ordinary plastic bag.  Now all he  had to do was find the right time to give it to Akane.</p><p>Akane sat in the vacant lot, fire burning in front  of her.</p><p>"My hands hurt, I need to take a break.  I sure hope Ranma appreciates what I'm doing  for him."  Akane sighed laying across  the grass.  It was kind of itchy against  her skin.  A cool breeze blew from the  north.  It was about to be  dinnertime.  Akane sat up, ready for  just one last round.</p><p>"I guess I should practice that dragon attack one  more time.  If Ranma and Ryoga could  learn an attack like that then so could I!"   Akane placed her hands in front of her chest; her palms were facing each  other.  She brought her palms together,  trying to focus.  She took a deep breath  and let it out.  A small glow came from  her hands.  She separated her  palms.  A small blue flame danced there  innocently.</p><p>"Yes!"  Akane  exclaimed happily.  "Finally!  I think I have the hang of this.  Man…I wonder if Ranma and Ryoga took so long  with it…" Akane suddenly noticed that she had got very tired.  She lowered her head and the little flame  vanished.  "Well I guess I need to  practice more, seeing as I don't seem to have control over it yet."  Akane sat back down and pulled out a few  notes she had scribbled.  She read them,  trying to find a way to master her new techniques.</p><p>A glimpse of red got her attention from the corner  of her eye.  She turned.  It was Ranma.  He looked like he was in deep thought.</p><p>Ranma walked all over the town; his mind was working  hard.  He passed a small lot.  It smelled pretty good over there.  Like roasted nuts.  He turned to the lot, spotting Akane.  She looked very worried.   "Hey Akane.  What are you doing  all the way out here?"  Ranma called to  her.</p><p>Akane hurriedly dumped rocks and dirt on the small  fire, putting it out.  She smiled at  Ranma.  "Oh, I was just doing something  for Kasumi is all."</p><p>Ranma approached her.  "What were you doing?   Smells like roasted nuts over here."</p><p>"Yes, I was roasting nuts for Kasumi to bake  with.  She loves to cook you know."</p><p>"Oh,  well…hey wait a second!"  Ranma said.</p><p>Akane got a worried look on her face.  Did he know what she was up to?</p><p>"Aren't you supposed to be trainin'?  Shampoo won't hold back her moves, you know that."</p><p>"Well, yes, but I decided to take a small break.  I've been going at it all day."  Akane  suddenly noticed the small bag Ranma had with him.  She saw her chance to change the subject.</p><p>"Hey Ranma, what's in the bag?"</p><p>This time, Ranma got the worried look.  "Oh…it's a present for…Uc-Chan" He  managed.  "With us being all friends  again, I though it was all fitting that we should thank her…"</p><p>"Oh, how nice.   Can I see it?"</p><p>"Uh…no…it's a secret…"</p><p>"Well, whatever Ranma.  I'm a bit tired, lets just go home.  I'm sure Ukyo will like it, whatever it is."</p><p>Ranma and Akane turned back to the Dojo.  Ranma noticed that Akane seemed a bit  winded.  "Geeze…I've never seen her so  focused before. I sure hope she likes what I got her…"</p><p>Ranma and Akane entered the Dojo. Kasumi served  dinner.  Nabiki had an usually cheerful  attitude.</p><p>"So, how is your training going Akane?"  Soun asked</p><p>"Oh, it's going fine dad.  Ukyo was nice enough to help me out a little.  At this rate, Shampoo will be no problem."</p><p>"Well I'm sure everyone is glad to hear that.  Even Ranma."  Ranma looked indifferent, his mind was on other things.</p><p>Dinner was finished in its usual manner, rather on  the quiet side.  Akane went to take her  bath.  Ranma started watching TV</p><p>Akane sat in the tub, thinking.  "Well, three more days…Ranma better not mess  things up like he usually does.  This  will be the hardest match I've ever had."   Akane winced a bit.  Hot water  had gotten on to her wound.  She usually  tried to keep it above water, but she was finding herself relaxing more with  each passing minute.  "Well, we will  just see what happens in a few days Shampoo.   I know you're gonna have a few tricks…so will I" Akane got out the bathtub  and headed to her room.  She got dressed  in her pajamas and broke out her books yet again:  another late night of studying.</p><p>Ranma, worrying to himself, went to bed early.  Maybe he should just wait until the day of  the match to give Akane her ring.</p><p><u>The  Beginning of the End</u></p><p>The days seemed to pass fast for Akane; Ukyo showed  up again, amazed the how fast Akane's hands were able to move.  Akane seemed to be acting like she was on  top of the world, like she could take on any challenge.  Hopefully she could.  Ranma, forgetting his troubles, just sat  back and watched Akane, his affections for her ever growing.  The day of the duel arrived shortly there  after…</p><p>Akane sent word of where the duel would take  place.  The ball field at Furinkan High  would be a perfect place.  She awoke  that morning, full of energy.  She ran  down stairs, finding Ranma watching TV.</p><p>"Ranma?  What  are you doing?  Shouldn't you be  asleep?  Even Kasumi isn't up yet."</p><p>"Oh, well…I just couldn't sleep, what with this  being the day of the duel."</p><p>"Ranma, you're not worried about me are you?  You should know by now I can take care of myself."  Akane said, trying to help Ranma relax.</p><p>Ranma turned to her and smiled.  "No, I wasn't worried about what would  happen to <i>you</i> but what would happen to Shampoo.  You think when she loses she will try to  kill herself or somethin'?"</p><p>Akane smiled.   "I don't know…everything about those amazons seems to be death and  revenge.  Honestly, I don't know how  they survive on all those old fashioned rules.   Well Ranma, I'm gonna go and warm up.   This is gonna be a long day."</p><p>"Ok Akane, good luck!"</p><p>Akane smiled and ran out the door, doing a few warm  up laps.</p><p>By the time she had got back.  Kasumi had already served breakfast and  everyone was eating.  Ukyo dropped by,  having closed her store all day today.   She brought a small Okonomiyaki grill for everyone during the duel.  The time was now.  Akane got up from the table, in her yellow Gi.  "Ok everyone, wish me luck."</p><p>"Oh no you don't Akane."  Nabiki demanded.  "We are  going with you!"</p><p>"Yes, I would hate to miss my little daughter's victory."  Soun said smiling, halfway wanting to spy on  what would happen between Ranma and Akane.</p><p>Everyone  got up, Kasumi was bringing a small first aid kit, just incase Akane scraped  her knees.  The whole family went out  the door, except for Ranma.</p><p>"Ok Ranma…here's your chance…" He said to himself.</p><p>"Hey Akane, can you come here a sec?"  He called.</p><p>"Sure, what is it Ranma?" Akane said, smiling.</p><p>"Well…I just wanted to wish you luck against  Shampoo…so I…Uh…"</p><p>"So you what?"</p><p>"You idiot just spit it out!"  Ranma yelled at himself.  "Well…I…got you a little gift…I hope you  like it."  He said, nervously, reaching  into his pocket and pulling out the small blue box.  He handed it to a confused Akane.  She removed the yellow bow and tore the paper.  It looked like it was going in slow  motion.  She pulled back the lid of the  fuzzy box…</p><p>Akane gasped.   Her heart jumped.  Her hands  began to start trembling.    She looked  up at Ranma.  He was leaning against the  wall, his hands in his pockets.  "Well I  just thought that would be fitting, seeing as you <i>are</i> gonna win."  He said, calmly.</p><p>Akane just looked up to him, tears of joy  starting.  "Ranma…this is…" She grabbed  Ranma, hugging him hard.  Ranma returned  a hug.</p><p>"Hey, its ok Akane."  Ranma offered.  He placed  his hands on her shoulders, gently pushing her away so he could look her in the  eye.  "Akane, I love you.  Promise me you'll beat Shampoo."</p><p>Akane smiled, wiping a few tears from her eyes.  "Ranma…you big dummy…you had this planned  the whole time didn't you?"</p><p>Ranma nodded, smiling broadly.  He had done something good all by himself.</p><p>Akane looked one more time at the ring.  She took it out the box and slipped it on  her finger.  "I guess that's means you  accept it?"  Ranma asked.  Akane did not answer but jumped into his  arms again.</p><p>"Ok Akane, enough of this.  You have a duel to win remember?"</p><p>Akane dried her eyes one more time.  "Yea, you're right Ranma.  Let's go end this once and for all."  Ranma and Akane walked out the door.  That new ring on Akane's finger sure did  look good on her.  She wore the ring  proudly.  She would show everyone after  the duel.</p><p><u>To Fight  the Unbeatable Foe</u></p><p>The ball field was deserted.  It was a Saturday and the last place any one  wanted to be would be at school.  The  Tendou family sat in the near by bleachers, accompanied by Ukyo, Mousse, and  Cologne.  Nabiki looked a bit  angry.  Ranma had taken the tickets she  had planned on selling.  Oh well, those  pictures of Ranma would bring in twice as much.</p><p>Akane walked into the field.  It was a very sunny mid-morning and very  warm.  Akane panned over the field,  pondering.  Was this a good place?  It was large and empty, save for the gate  that surrounded the field and the very tall gate at the near end.  She looked back at her family.  They were cheering for her victory.  Ranma just sat there, smiling.  Akane suddenly got sight of Mousse.  He seemed to be totally indifferent to all  this.  Cologne looked confident.</p><p>"I wonder  what tricks she taught Shampoo."  Akane  thought to herself.  She brought her  hand closer to her, examining the ring Ranma had given her.  She turned it a bit, reflecting the light in  the largest diamond.  It seemed to  assure her of her victory.  She closed  her eyes and looked up into the sky.   She took a deep breath, gaining her focus.  For some reason a few tears made their way out.  "Akane, stop this…you'll be fine.  There is no way you can lose.  Not with the techniques you learned."  Akane said to herself.  A figure emerged from the far side of the  field.  It was wearing loose clothes and  had long, blue hair.  It was  Shampoo.  Akane readied herself, placing  a hand on her wound.  It was just about  healed thanks to Dr. Tofu.</p><p>"Akane!"   Shampoo said fiercely.  "You  ready to lose?  Shampoo win Ranma."</p><p>Akane smiled a bit.   "Over my dead body Shampoo!"</p><p>"Well, if that way you want it.  Shampoo aim to please."</p><p>The two stared at each other.</p><p>"The duel of the fates will now begin!"  Cologne announced.  "The only way to win is by knockout or forfeit.  There are no rules.  May the best Amazon win!"</p><p>Akane wasn't an Amazon.</p><p>Cologne turned to Ranma.  "No interference son-in-law.   To do is an act punishable…"</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes.  "Let me guess, punishable by death?  Yea whatever" he interrupted.   Cologne turned back to the two duelers.   "Now's my chance to see what Akane was hiding all this time.  I hope it's good."  Ranma thought to himself.</p><p>"Begin!"   Cologne demanded.</p><p>Akane took her stance.  "Ok…here we go.  This will  be easy."</p><p>Akane charged Shampoo, fists clenched.  She shot a right at Shampoo's head.  Effortlessly, Shampoo crouched and caught  Akane in the stomach.  Akane gasped as  Shampoo launched her backward with a kick, making her land on her back.  Everyone gasped, except Ranma, who was confident.</p><p>"Oh Dear!"   Kasumi exclaimed.  "Shampoo might  have hurt Akane."  Soun looked over to  Nabiki and Genma.  They shook their  heads.</p><p>"Um…Kasumi dear.   Maybe you shouldn't watch this.   Things are going to get very ugly."   Soun said.</p><p>"Oh, nonsense father.  Akane is my little sister.   I'll make sure I'm here for her every step of the way."  Soun looked a bit worried</p><p>"<i>Damn</i>!"   Akane cursed.  "Shampoo moves as  fast as Ranma now.  Well I'll just have  to compensate.  Now I know what I'm  dealing with."</p><p>Akane rose to her feet, taking a defensive  stance.  Shampoo rushed to her,  launching a high kick.  Akane tilted her  lead to the left, just avoiding the blow.   She launched a punch at Shampoo.   Shampoo leaped over the punch, landing a sold kick to Akane's face.  Akane was sent back.  She recovered with a backwards flip, landing  on her feet.  Shampoo charged again, not  giving Akane a chance to regain her composure.   She launched a punch at Akane's chest.   Akane caught the fist, placing her hands on her wrist, leaping into the  air.  She flipped over Shampoo, her body  turning to face Shampoo's back.  She let  fly a kick, striking Shampoo in the back of the head, and landed, ready for  more.  Shampoo was sent into the ground  hard.   A small dust cloud arose from  her landing.</p><p>Shampoo quickly jumped up.  "Akane got better."  She  said, smiling slyly at Akane.</p><p>"Yea?  Well  you have too."  Akane said, returning a  smile.</p><p>"Is no matter though.  Akane no match for Great-Grandmother's training.  Shampoo make short work of Akane."  Shampoo raised her hand to the air.  Dust started swirling around her, seeming to  gather inside her palm.</p><p>Akane took the defensive.  "Oh man! This doesn't look good.   What is she up to?"</p><p>"Is time to die Akane!"  Shampoo said fiercely.   Her hair was blowing in some strange wind, the dust seemed to thin out a  bit.</p><p>"<i>Kyouran no Onigami</i>!"  (Fury of the Titians)</p><p>Shampoo launched her fist straight to the ground,  striking it hard.  The ground started  trembling.  Akane looked at her  feet.  The ground abruptly split open,  sending a jagged spear of rock towards Akane's chest.  Akane back flipped, avoiding the spear.  She landed, only to find another one bursting forth from the  sand.  She rolled out the way, planting  her hands on the ground and thrusting herself in the sky, avoiding yet another  spear.  She landed, feeling something  from the bottom of her foot.  A large,  curved spike jutted out, throwing Akane off balance and into the ground.  Another appeared, just as Akane's head moved  out the way.  She felt the ground  shaking even more violently.   Desperately, she rolled; avoiding what seemed like dozens of  spikes.  She hurriedly clambered to her  feet and leapt away, just as a spear caught her pant leg, cutting easily  through it.</p><p>Shampoo lifted her fist out of the ground, with a  satisfied look on her face. The spears that had jutted out of the ground  disintegrated, not even leaving a trace that they were there.</p><p>Akane looked over to her.  "Is that the best you can do?"   she shouted,  "Those rock things  didn't even touch me."  Shampoo pointed  the Akane's torn pant leg.  She looked  down, seeing a trail of blood going down her leg and resting in her sock.  Akane suddenly felt a sharp pain in her  knee.  That spear had cut into her  knee.  Akane shook off the pain.  Shampoo had drawn first blood.  "This could be harder than I though."  Akane said to herself.  She looked over to Ranma.  He was a bit shocked at that move Shampoo  had launched.  He even looked a bit  worried.</p><p>Ranma, noticing Akane was looking at him, offered a  bit of encouragement. "Hey Akane, don't worry about it.  We all think you can win!"  Akane smiled and nodded.  She whirled on Shampoo, regaining her focus.</p><p>Shampoo smiled at her.  "You know Akane.  Ranma  and I had good time back at Kat Café.   Ranma very happy to see Shampoo…at night."</p><p>Ranma leaned forward, angrily.  "Oh man…Akane is going to lose her  temper.  If she does, this duel is  over."</p><p>Akane got tense, narrowing her eyes at Shampoo.  "What are you talking about Shampoo?  Ranma told me you tried that stuff with  him.  Too bad he <i>refused</i>!"</p><p>Shampoo continued her onslaught.  "No, Ranma did not refuse, after he saw how  much more beautiful Shampoo was.  Is  shame that Akane never will have body like Shampoo.  Shampoo put it to good use when you lose today."</p><p>Akane charged Shampoo; she had heard enough of her  plans.  She thrust a kick at her.  The speed Akane moved was incredible, even  to Shampoo.  Shampoo took a step  backward, seeming to lead Akane in a dance of death.</p><p>Ranma turned pale.   "That's <i>my</i> attack…" He thought to himself.  He snapped his head to Cologne, who was  rather pleased.  "Akane…Watch out you  stupid—" Cologne silenced Ranma with a blow form her staff to his mouth.  Ranma was knocked back in his seat, falling  hard on the bleachers.</p><p>Shampoo kept leading Akane around in circles.  She reached the final step.  Akane, seeming to be blind with anger,  continued her attacks.  Shampoo took the  last step.  She lowered her fist.  Wind started to swirl around her and Akane,  catching all the dust that had rested on the ground.</p><p>"Ok Akane, calm down…you knew she would try this  move."  Akane said, relaxing.</p><p>"<i>Hiryuu Shoten Ha</i>!"</p><p>Shampoo threw her fist at Akane, winds swirling  violently.  Akane smiled to  herself.  She took a last gasp of  air.  She then flipped on Shampoo; her  hands were planted in Shampoo's fist.   Using the force of the rising wind, and Shampoo's own strength, Akane  leapt off in the opposite direction, towards the tall fence.  The twister had missed.  Shampoo turned to see what happened.  Akane rebounded off the fence, sending a  diving kick into Shampoo's chest.   Shampoo was launched back several feet, hitting the ground hard and  rolling violently.</p><p>Akane landed, focusing on Shampoo, who lay on the  ground, moving a bit.</p><p>Cologne took a serious look.  "The "<i>Sakasama Hiryuu Shoten Ha (</i>reverse  Dragon's heaven blast<i>)."</i> I had no idea Akane would learn that  move."  Cologne said to no one in  particular.</p><p>Ranma, hearing Cologne's wisdom, sat there  amazed.  "Akane must have switched her  hot battle aura to cold.  It was like  two magnets that repelled each other."   Ranma looked to Akane.  "Nice one  Akane!"  He shouted.  Akane did not respond.  Shampoo had got back to her feet.  Soun and Genma looked at each other.  They had faith that this would end well.</p><p>Shampoo dusted her self off.  Her shoulder was a bit hurt.  She turned to Akane.  "Is no more games Akane," she said angrily.  "Shampoo finish this now!"</p><p>"Well, I'm waiting Shampoo.  You know.   I've always wanted to plant your sorry face in the ground like  that.  How <i>dare</i> you try to steal  my Ranma!  Always kissing him and  throwing yourself in his arms, that made me so mad…"</p><p>"Oh, so sorry Akane.  Maybe if you act like real woman, Ranma would come to you easy."</p><p>This fight had started to turn ugly.  Akane's temper started to rise again.  This time she would not calm down.</p><p>Shampoo charged Akane, throwing a volley of  punches.  Akane threw up her arms,  covering her face.  Shampoo launched a  violent kick, making Akane slide backwards in the sand.  She remained standing, Shampoo charging  again.</p><p>"Ok Shampoo.   This is it!"  Akane lowered her  fists to her waist, taking a step back for the sake of stability.</p><p>"<i>Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken</i>!"</p><p>Shampoo was stunned.  Akane dove towards her, raining fits upon Shampoo's undefended  body.  The blows numbered in the  hundreds.  Akane finished with her  famous uppercut, sending Shampoo flying backwards and into the ground.  Ranma looked on, all eyes ere on him.</p><p>"Ranma…did you teach that move to Akane?"  Genma asked.  Ranma shook his head.</p><p>"So that explains the mystery of the burnt  hands.  Akane is gonna win for  sure!"  Ranma noted; stunned that  another one of his moves was being used.   Soun and Genma hugged each other.   Akane <i>was</i> going to win!   Kasumi sat in the bleachers; her hand covered her mouth in shock.  This was for real.</p><p>Ranma turned to Cologne.  Her good mood had all but died.</p><p>Akane walked up to a struggling Shampoo.  She looked down at her, menacingly.  Shampoo looked into her eyes, dust swirling  around Akane.  There was a fire that  burned in them.  Shampoo noticed a small  sparkle coming from one of Akane's fingers.   An engagement ring…it did not matter, she would win Ranma.  Shampoo moved her hand across her face.  Her lip was bloody and it seemed like her  whole body hurt.</p><p>Finally, Shampoo got to her feet.  She was wavering a bit.  "Akane!"   She snapped.  "This not over!  Ranma mine!   I show you power of 3000 year Amazon history!"</p><p>Akane watched.   Shampoo's body seemed to be recovering.   She took a step back, ready for anything.</p><p>"Shampoo's school of Anything Goes Martial Arts  Ultimate Attack!"</p><p>Ranma looked at Shampoo, half seriously. "Boy she  sure is confident isn't she?"  Ranma  asked Cologne.  She did not answer.</p><p>"<i>Shinzenbi Neko Ken</i>!"  (True Cat Fist)</p><p>Akane's eyes widened.  Shampoo calmly closed her eyes, seeming relax a bit.  She lowered her head, slightly.</p><p>Ranma looked on worriedly.  "Oh man…I hope Akane is prepared for this.  I had no idea anyone could enter the <i>Cat  Fist</i> state voluntarily!  Akane!  Watch out!"</p><p>Akane did not hear.   Shampoo raised her head.  Her  eyes and turned into those of a cat, yellow pupils rose vertically in her  eyes.  Shampoo hissed a bit.  She got on all fours, ready to pounce.  Akane took a step back.  She gritted her teeth, trying to remain  focused.</p><p>Shampoo leaped at Akane, her speed was that of  lightning.  She extended her hand and  swiped Akane against the face, leaving several bloody marks.  Akane yelled in pain.  Shampoo launched a fist to her chest,  connecting squarely on Akane's wound.   The force of the impact threw her on the ground.  Shampoo pounced again.  Akane rolled backwards, catching Shampoo's  chin with her foot.  She sprung to her  feet, only to see that Shampoo still remained on the attack.  She swiped at her chest, leaving several  bloody gashes.  Akane put her hand on  her chest.  Her top had been torn,  revealing her sports bra.  She launched  her other fist at Shampoo.  Shampoo  easily dodged the attack, swiping again, this time catching Akane in the  belly.  Akane was thrown backwards.  Shampoo's claws felt like little flaming  knives against her skin.  She lay on her  back, noting the damage done to her and her outfit.</p><p>"This was no time to be vain Akane!  You have to find an opening."  Akane thought to herself. Shampoo had taken  this time to clean off her hands, stained with Akane's blood.</p><p>Akane slowly got up, holding her stomach.  Shampoo noticed that Akane had got back up  and took to the offensive again.  Akane  was ready this time.</p><p>"<i>Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken</i>!"</p><p>Akane launched her new attack at Shampoo.  Shampoo dodged all the blows with the  agility of a cat.  She struck Akane,  sending her back.  Shampoo pounced  again, this time latching on to Akane.   Shampoo's fingernails sank deep in Akane's shoulders.  Akane screamed in pain.  Shampoo fell backwards, throwing her like a  small stuffed toy.  Akane landed face  first.  Shampoo was charging again.  Akane launched her legs out, tripping  Shampoo.  She fell backwards, but  twisted her back, contorting it in a way as to land on her feet.  Shampoo pounced Akane, still lying on the  ground.  Akane grabbed her shirt,  throwing her over her head and into the ground.  Again she landed on her feet.   This gave Akane an opportunity to clamber to hers.  Shampoo took a more human stance, seeming to  remember her human side.  She seemed to  teleport to Akane's position, planting an elbow in her stomach.  Akane caved inward.  Shampoo followed with a crushing fist blow  to the small of her back.  Akane landed  on her hands and knees.  Shampoo kicked Akane  in the face, ruthlessly sending her on her back.  She took a few steps back.</p><p>Akane lie in a heap on the dirt-covered field.  She sat herself up, looking at Shampoo.  She still had that look in her eye.  She clenched her teeth, summoning up the  power to stand.</p><p>"Akane!"  Ranma  called.  She turned to the bleachers;  everyone was worried.</p><p>"<i>Stay out of this Ranma</i>!"  Akane snapped.  Ranma was taken aback.   Akane stared at Shampoo.  "I have  <i>got</i> to do something!"  Akane got  up to her feet, preparing herself.   Shampoo smiled a cat like smile and took to the offensive again.</p><p>She raced to Akane, claws bared.  Akane took a step back, hesitating.  Shampoo was just too fast in this form for  her to deal with.  Shampoo swiped at  Akane.  Akane thought for a minute.  She had tried that move on Ranma earlier in  the week.  Akane grabbed Shampoo by the  arm and, using Shampoo's momentum, swung her around.  Shampoo's back was now to Akane.   Akane shot her fist out at her, aiming for the back of Shampoo's  head.  Shampoo did a forward flip,  shooting out her foot.  It caught her in  her old wound, making her gasp in pain.   Shampoo now balanced on her hands and kicked Akane again, this time  catching her in the jaw.  Akane's head  jerked back, sending blood flying behind her.  Shampoo turned to face Akane.   She had taken a few steps back but had still remained on her feet.  She snapped her head at Shampoo, blood now  running down her face.</p><p>Ranma couldn't take this sight.  He leapt out his seat, aiming for the  field.  Cologne whirled to him, hitting  him with the point of her staff, just behind his ear.  Ranma's body went numb.   He was unable to move anything except for his head.  Ranma tried to get up, but it seemed like  his body was too heavy to even move.  He  narrowed his eyes at Cologne.  Cologne  ignored this.</p><p>"Do <i>not</i> interfere son-in-law."  She said, not even turning to him.  Genma looked down to him, worriedly.</p><p>"Ranma!  It  is the code of a martial artist not to interfere in duels.  Have you lost your mind?"</p><p>Ranma turned to him.  "Well you try just sittin' still when your Fiancée is bleedin'  everywhere."</p><p>Soun turned to him.   "Ranma…I know it is difficult to watch, as it is difficult for everyone  here.  You must believe that Akane will  win.  If you had interfered, she would  have never forgiven you."  Ranma looked  at him.  He was right.  But it was hard just sitting there, doing  nothing.  Now he didn't have a choice.</p><p>Akane wiped her nose with her sleeve.  Shampoo was just standing there, seeming to  give Akane a chance to plan her next attack.</p><p>"Dammit!"   Akane cursed to herself.  "What  am I gonna do?  There is no way I can  match her speed."  She lowered her eyes  in thought.  "There is one way…I guess  it all comes to this."</p><p>Shampoo noticed that Akane had let her guard down.  Finally!   She leapt into the air, catching Akane in the head with a massive  kick.  Akane was sent to the ground.  She sprung off her hands, only to find  Shampoo was already behind her.  Another  kick sent Akane rolling forward.   Shampoo continued her attack.   Akane rolled out of her way and regained her footing.  Shampoo charged again.  Akane stood upright, lifting her hands in  front of her chest.  She turned her  palms so that they were facing each other.   Shampoo stopped her attack, curious.</p><p>"Shampoo!   I'll send you to <i>hell</i> where you belong!"  Akane yelled</p><p>Shampoo just stood there; here eyes were glowing  brightly in the sun.</p><p>Akane placed her hands together, almost as if  praying.  The air around her began to  shimmer.  Cologne looked on,  amazed.  The Tendou family leaned  forward.  "Ok Akane.  You have to try and focus.  <i>Use</i> your anger and don't let it  control you."  Akane cleared her mind.</p><p>Ukyo took a worried look.  "Akane…please…you have to win this.  For Ran-Chan's sake.  He  is so happy around you.  I would hate to  see that happiness slip away.  Trust me,  I know how it feels."  She thought to  herself, in a manner as to try and communicate with Akane.</p><p>Dust started to swirl around Akane; the force was  even picking up small pebbles.  Akane  separated her hands, revealing a small blue flame.  "Shampoo!  You will not  haunt Ranma any more" Akane said, calmly</p><p>"Tendou School of Anything Goes Martial Arts  Ultimate Technique!"</p><p>"<i>Tenrai Ryuujin no Hitoare</i>!"  (Divine Dragon God's Rage)</p><p>The small blue flame exploded into a monstrous  torrent of energy.  The flames enveloped  Shampoo; muffling her cries.  Shampoo  was sent into the large fence, the flames tearing at everything around.</p><p>The torrent ended as abruptly as it had begun.  Akane now lay on her hands and knees,  breathing heavily.  Shampoo lie against  the fence, not moving.</p><p>"Akane! You did it!   That was incredible!"  Ranma  shouted.  Cologne stopped him with her  staff.  "This duel is not over yet  son-in-law.  Shampoo still has the will  to fight."  Ranma looked over to  Shampoo.  She lay against the fence,  slouched over.  He noticed that her arms  had started to move.  She placed her arm  weakly on the ground and the other one on the fence.  She slowly climbed to a somewhat standing position.  Her form was burned and leaning over.</p><p>"Akane…You no win yet…" Shampoo said through her  pain.  She started to Akane, limping and  holding her shoulder.</p><p>Akane just sat there, unable to move.  She was breathing heavily.  "Shit!   Shampoo is still coming after me."   She thought to herself.  "I gave  that attack my all and it still wasn't enough.   I…have got to finish this!"   Akane summoned all her rage, granting her to power to stand with her own  strength.  She stared at Shampoo.  That look in her eyes was gone.  Akane raised her fists, ready for another  round.</p><p>Shampoo ran over to Akane, throwing a punch.  Akane threw up a forearm, and then launched  her own attack.  Shampoo leaped  back.  Akane charged her.  Shampoo sidestepped her attack, planting a  knee in her stomach.  Akane gasped,  blood from her nose fell to the ground.   Akane fell to the ground, holding her stomach.  She rolled over, seeing Shampoo aiming for her.  She executed a sweep attack on Shampoo,  knocking her to the ground.  Akane rose  to her feet quickly.  Shampoo followed  suit.</p><p>It was Shampoo that lead off next.  Akane noticed that Shampoo fought similarly  to Ranma.  She closed in.  Akane leapt towards her, ducking her punch  and launching her uppercut to Shampoo's jaw.   Shampoo's feet left the ground.   Akane kicked her in the stomach, sending her backwards.  Shampoo rolled, springing off the fence and  leaping to her.</p><p>"I knew it!"   Akane thought to herself.   "Cologne knew a lot about how Ranma fought and taught that to  Shampoo.  This time I'm ready!"</p><p>Shampoo kicked towards Akane's head.  Akane grabbed the Amazon's foot.  She whirled around, throwing her to the  ground hard.</p><p>Akane almost fell to the ground.  She was breathing very heavily.  She looked over to Shampoo.  She was getting back up.  Akane gritted her teeth.</p><p>"I can't keep this up much longer…I have got to end  this…but Shampoo seems have infinite endurance."</p><p>Shampoo got to her feet, continuing the duel.  She closed in on Akane.  Akane managed a meager defense.  Most of her energy was gone.  Shampoo jumped up and kneed Akane in the  face, sending her a few steps back.  She  followed her knee with the rest of her foot.   Akane refused to fall.  If she  fell now she may not be able to get up again.   She mustered the rest of her will power and took the offensive back from  Shampoo.  Shampoo easily guarded against  her blows.  Akane tried for a right to  her head.  Shampoo ducked down, placing  an elbow in Akane's chest.  Shampoo shot  her palm back, striking Akane hard in the mouth.  She then whirled around with a roundhouse to the side of Akane's  face, sending her spinning to the ground.   Shampoo stood there, breathing as heavily as Akane was.  "Is time to give up Akane.  Ranma mine!"</p><p>Akane laid face first in the ground.  She struggled to bring herself up to her hands  and knees.  Her breathing was starting  to her more labored.  Shampoo approached  her; her shadow was drawing ever closer.</p><p>"I…can't give up…not yet!"  Akane thought.  "I was so  close to defeating Shampoo.  I…promised  Ranma that I would win."  She felt  something warm flow down her nose.   Blood.  Her nose must have been  broken; the previous attacks must have made it bleed again.  She felt another drop of blood.  She watched it as it hit her ring  finger.  Another drop fell, this time it  was clear.</p><p>"I'm…crying…but why?"  Akane suddenly realized she was in a fair amount of pain.  Her whole body ached. "Ugh…I can't give up  this fight…not to Shampoo…" She struggled against herself to try and get up,  but she could not.  Shampoo walked over  to her.  She looked down at Akane,  angrily, kicking her in the ribs.  Akane  gasped in pain, her cries were unable to make it out, due to the breath she  lost.</p><p>"Akane!  Just  give it up!"  Ranma shouted.  "There is no need for this.  I can find a way out of this wedding, trust  me!"</p><p>"<i>Ranma, I said stay out of this</i>!"  Akane shouted back, painfully.  Her eyes were held shut and her teeth were  clenched in pain.  Shampoo shot another  foot in her ribs.  There really were no  rules.  She then launched the final  blow, making Akane fall to the side, rolling onto her back.</p><p>Akane now lie on her back.  She was trying to stop her tears.  The world around her started to get fuzzy.  "Oh…I can't keep this up…" Her body pleaded  with her to surrender, but her will said that she would not.  Akane sat up her head, looking at  Shampoo.  She was in pretty bad shape  but at least she was still standing.   Akane started to get a bit sleepy.   "Man…so tired…" Akane relaxed her sore muscles.  Ranma noticed this and shouted  something.  Akane did not hear it.  All she knew at this time was sleep.  Yes…she was so tired, but she tried  desperately to stay awake for Ranma.</p><p>"<i>Akane</i>!   <i>Damn it</i>!  Why do you have  to be so Un-cute!"  Ranma  demanded,.  Akane could hear the tears  in his voice.  "Just give up this damn duel!  Its not worth it!"</p><p>Akane stirred a bit.  Un-cute…he had called her un-cute…so familiar of him to do  something stupid like that.  Akane's  blood pressure started to rise again.   The world started to regain focus.   Shampoo was about to strike Akane down.</p><p>Something exploded in Akane's chest.  "Un-Cute…I'll show you Un-cute!"  Akane whispered, almost like a reflex. The  world came into clear focus. Shampoo lifted her foot up, thrusting it down to  Akane's head.</p><p>"Ranma you jerk.   This isn't over!"  Akane got a  sudden burst of energy, catching Shampoo's foot just in front of her nose. She  threw Shampoo's foot aside.  Shampoo  took a few steps back, seeing Akane rising from the ground like a Phoenix rises  from the flames.</p><p>Akane regained her focus, seeming to stare into  Shampoo's soul.  Shampoo shot a fist out  at her.  Akane stuck out her hand,  catching the fist and squeezing it tightly.   Akane never took her eyes off Shampoo's face.  She watched as Shampoo's face contorted in pain.  She continued to squeeze, hearing several  popping noises.  Shampoo finally  released herself from Akane's grasp, holding her hand.</p><p>Cologne shook her head.  "This duel is over…that is the true power of the <i>Fist of the  Phoenix.</i> Only a few people are able to obtain its true power.  The three points:  Strength.  Love.  Rage.   Meet perfectly within a person's being.   They each feed off a person's life force, granting almost infinite  power.  I should have known Akane would  not lose so easy. In the same manner that the <i>Neko Ken</i> worked for you,  the <i>Fist of the Phoenix</i> works by drawing off intense emotions.  Namely anger"</p><p>Ranma just listened on, his eyes still on the duel.</p><p>Shampoo launched a kick at Akane.  Instinctively, Akane shot up a forearm,  blocking the blow.  "Shampoo.  Ranma is mine!"  Akane said, holding up her fist.   Shampoo noticed that her ring was very dirty.</p><p>"Shampoo never give up Ranma!"  She said launching her one remaining hand at  Akane.  Akane flipped over her fist,  catching Shampoo's head and pulling it down to the ground.  Shampoo hit the ground hard, but was only  stunned for a second.  She brought her  legs around, wrapping her ankles around Akane's head.  She flung Akane, slowly getting up.  Akane flipped and landed on her feet.</p><p>Akane took the offensive, running to Shampoo.  She advanced on Shampoo, throwing a heavy  right. Shampoo was sent reeling.  A left  soon followed.  It caught her on the  side of the nose sending a few drops of blood flying.  Akane elbowed Shampoo in the eye, knocking her on her back.  Shampoo got up, seeming to draw strength  from Akane.  Akane sent a kick to her  stomach, followed by a kick to the face.   Shampoo tried to block the kicks, but they were too powerful.  Akane did a roundhouse, knocking Shampoo  down another time.</p><p>Shampoo slowly climbed to her feet.  Victory was her only alternative. "Akane,  you no win this!"  Shampoo shouted,  struggling to get back to her feet.</p><p>Akane did  not hear Shampoo's words.   Viciously  she sent a flurry of punches at her.   Shampoo was starting to lose her footing.  Akane brought her leg up, connecting with Shampoo's jaw.  She then brought her foot down, striking  Shampoo hard on the forehead.  Shampoo  fell to the ground with a tremendous <i>thud</i>.  She did not try to get back up.   Akane turned around to Ranma, who was getting out of his seat.  That little trick Cologne pulled had worn  off.</p><p>Akane stood  over Shampoo, victoriously.  She turned  to Ranma, who was running down to greet her.</p><p>"Ranma…I…I did it."   Akane said weakly. All the rage in her heart subsided as she fell to the  ground. Ranma rushed after her, catching her in his arms.  He looked down at his new fiancée,  smiling.  She had won.  Her face was cut badly and blood still came  out of her nose.  The blood had stained  her yellow Gi, which was in even worse condition.  Everyone ran down to the couple, not saying a word.  Ranma turned to everyone relieved.</p><p>"I think we should just go home."  Everyone nodded.  No one mentioned the word Hospital.  Akane needed to be home, close to her friends and Family.</p><p>Ranma's mind turned to Shampoo.  He turned to where Shampoo lie, seeing  Mousse holding her.  "I told you  Saotome.  I had a few tricks up my  sleeve."  Mousse then leapt away,  leaving Cologne, standing near Ranma.</p><p>"Son-in-law.   We have lost fairly.  We will not  bother you again.  Do be a good husband  to Akane as I have hoped you would be to Shampoo."  With that, Cologne jumped off, following Mousse.</p><p>The Tendou household started back to their  Dojo.   Soun couldn't help but  smile.  His legacy shall be continued,  in Ranma and Akane.</p><p>Ryoga sat in a near by tree, having observed the  entire fight.  "Akane…I cannot win your  heart.  It belongs to someone else.  I will admit defeat as a man, once and for  all.  Maybe we will meet again, my  beloved Akane.  Perhaps I can see your  children."  Ryoga waited until everyone  was gone.  A few spots of blood lay  drying on the field.  Ryoga turned  around, heading into the nearest forest he could see.  He would also leave the couple alone.</p><p><u>A New  Beginning</u></p><p>Akane awoke downstairs, Ranma still holding  her.  It was pretty late by now.  The sweet smells of dinner entered her  nose.  She noticed that she was very sore  and tired.</p><p>"Hey, you awake you tomboy?"  Ranma asked with a smile.</p><p>"Ranma…you idiot…" Akane said slowly.  "Did I really do it?"</p><p>"Yea you did. Everyone saw you win.  Don't worry about Shampoo.  Mousse and Cologne took her away.  She will be as good as new in a little  while."</p><p>"Well…that's good."   Tears began to escape Akane's eyes.</p><p>Ranma smiled, wiping a tear from her cheek.  Akane returned a smile.  Their eyes met.  Akane placed a hand behind Ranma's head, pulling him closer to  her face.  Ranma lowered his head and  closed his eyes.  Their lips met.  Everyone stopped what they were doing,  watching Ranma and Akane.</p><p>After a few moments they released each other, gazing  lovingly into each other's eyes.</p><p>"I love you…Ranma."   Akane said softly.</p><p>"I love you too, Akane." Ranma returned.  Akane's muscles relaxed.  She went back to sleep.  Her body needed time to heal.  Maybe the healing process had already begun.</p><p>*****Yea yea…I know. But hey, I thought it was a  nice way to wrap up this chapter. Besides, this was almost a year ago when I started  to write this. Ah memories…Looking back now that my writing skills have grown…I  feel the sudden urge to rewrite this entire story from scratch. I dunno. Maybe  my technique has changed a bit more than I thought. I still think it's good but…it  could be so much better.  However, that  fight scene with Akane and Shampoo is prolly one of the best ones I ever wrote.  I still look back to that one for inspiration during my other stories and fan  fictions. Oh, and don't worry if the move names aren't correct. They prolly aren't  in a traditional sense, but they work…</p><p>So, I hope I didn't disappoint. Tell me what you  think! I spent a little more time on my spelling this time around. I've noticed  a few inconsistencies. (Thanks for the reviews guys!)</p><p>Speaking of inconsistencies I've hit a small roadblock  on my other Fanfic. No, not writer's block. If you ask me, writer's block is just  an excuse for laziness. There is no such thing. If you can't come up with  something, write about why you can't. Write about something…anything. And then,  your ideas will come. However, my story <u>Grateful Days</u> (for those of you  who knew me back a year ago, it's the rewritten version of <u>Memories</u>.) is  due for a re-focus session. I think I lost track somewhere in between a crucial  plot point, which I decided to do after seeing how many Hentai Fanfics were  there. I wondered the same thing I did in the next few chapters of Obsessions,  upon reading a supposed action between two people (use your imagination) I wondered,  "What would really happen in the Ranma-verse if said incident happened?" Don't  worry. It's nothing bad. But if I say too much more, it'll spoil it. Well,  doubt you people will remember when it's posted anyway. I still have to post 15  more chapters of <u>Obsessions</u>, and the story I wrote after that. <u>Just  Give Me One More Chance</u>. Again, I started that a long time ago. Around June  I believe. I'll bet the Shiro Inazuma knows…</p><p>Oops my bad. That next plot arc (after reading some Hentai  Fanfic once because I was bored) doesn't come to fruition until the last  paragraph of chapter 8. Sorry…I'll post really fast! So what <i>does</i> happen  after this fight…</p><p>Oh. That's what happens. Well, hope you will like  it! Until next we meet!</p><p>And a shot out to everyone that reviewed! Thank you  all so much! If this keeps up…I don't suppose I'll ever stop writing fan  fictions. Even when I do become a published author (God willing I will!)</p><p>So thanks, and see ya!*****</p>
