</div><p>Chapter  Twelve</p><p><u>Just by  Chance…</u></p><p>Ranma awoke late on the ninth.  Something felt different according to  him.  He sat up and looked around a  bit.  It was about 9:30.  Ranma got up and went downstairs.  They were going to do something for his  birthday; Ranma could feel it.   Something was about to happen.</p><p>Ranma walked down stairs.  Everyone was at the dinner table, except for Akane.</p><p>"Hey, where's Akane at?"  Ranma asked</p><p>Everyone pointed to the kitchen.  Ranma stood there, looking towards it.</p><p>"This is gonna be bad…" Ranma said, starting towards  it.</p><p>"Akane says the kitchen is off limits."  Genma said.</p><p>"Sure…whatever."   Ranma said, sitting down at the dinner table.  All kinds of interesting sounds were coming out of the  kitchen.  Ranma got a bit worried.</p><p>Time passed by quickly for Akane, who was hard at  work in the kitchen.</p><p>"Cook from the heart huh?"  Akane said, preparing her third cake.  The others had…problems.   "Well I thought I was doing that from the beginning."  Akane thought back to the training she had  had with Kasumi.  She wiped her forehead  with her sleeve and continued to press onward.</p><p>"Finally!"   Akane exclaimed after a few hours.   She had tasted the batter of the cake and took a small pinch of the  completed project as a sample.  It was  pretty good.  Only thing was the cake  was a bit lopsided, but that could be corrected with the proper frosting  technique.  Akane got the frosting and  started to the cake.</p><p>"Ranma! Can you come down here a minute?"  A voice called from downstairs.  It was Nabiki.  Ranma smiled to himself, fully aware of what was about to  happen.  He walked down stairs, now  allowed to come back down them.   Everyone except Akane was standing at the dinner table, smiling  broadly.  Ranma smiled nervously,  birthdays always made him a bit embarrassed.</p><p>"Happy Birthday Ranma."  Genma said; the others followed suit.  They gestured to the dining table.  Ranma sat down, a bit embarrassed and a bit worried.</p><p>"Akane worked all day on a special gift just for  you."  Kasumi said.  "She has worked very hard on it.  I do hope you enjoy it."</p><p>Ranma sat eagerly at the table, his eyes going over  everyone present.  He felt so welcome  there.  That made him relax a little  bit.  After a few moments, Akane emerged  from the kitchen, proudly carrying a cake frosted in vanilla icing. The cake  had two crude little drawings.  One was  a face with black hair.  The other was a  face with red hair.  The faces were both  smiling.   She set it down before him,  beaming proudly.</p><p>Ranma looked up to Akane.  She was so proud of her work.</p><p>"Well, go on Ranma, try it.  I worked all morning on it."  Akane said.   Ranma eyed the cake, all past experiences coming back to him.</p><p>"Go on boy."   Genma said.</p><p>"Yes, go ahead Ranma.  It is only proper for you to take the first slice."  Soun said, handing Ranma a knife.</p><p>"You can trust me Ranma, as hard as Akane has worked  on that cake, it is good."  Nabiki  added, with a bit of a smile.</p><p>"Well…Ok" Ranma said with a nervous chuckle.  He drew the knife along the cake, separating  a large piece from the main body.  It  would make Akane so happy if Ranma ate such a big piece.  He set the section on his little plate.  He looked around one last time.  Everyone was happy for him and for Akane.</p><p>"Hurry up Ranma, I know you're just gonna love  it.  Its yellow cake."  Akane said.</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath, bringing the slice to his  mouth.  He took a large bite.  He held it in his mouth for a few  seconds.  He started to chew, his mind  focusing on the flavor.</p><p>"Well…how is it?"   Akane asked eagerly.</p><p>"Well…its…" Ranma started, his mouth was a bit full  and the words just managed to make it out.   Abruptly, Ranma started coughing and gagging violently.  Everyone looked seriously at him.</p><p>"Ranma, this is not a time for games, Akane worked  so hard for you."  Kasumi said,  concerned.</p><p>"Yea, come on Ranma, that joke is getting old."  Nabiki Followed.</p><p>Akane just looked at Ranma, All that hard work.  All those mornings of training...</p><p>"I…I'm sorry…" Akane said sadly, a tear forming in  her eye.  "I gave it my all…I put my  heart into making that…and that was the best I could do…" Akane ran up stairs,  devastated.  She slammed the door, hurt.</p><p>Everyone looked at the still choking Ranma.</p><p>"Ranma…that was <i>not</i> funny!' 'Genma said  fiercely.</p><p>"Ranma…how dare you…after all that work Akane put  into baking that…" Soun started.  He  looked closer to Ranma.  His eyes were  watering.  "Ranma…are you ok?"</p><p>"N-no…" Ranma managed weakly through his  coughs.  Kasumi ran and got Ranma glass  of water.  She patted him on the back a  few times.  Ranma recovered, still  coughing a bit.</p><p>"Ranma what was that all about?  You weren't kidding around were you?"  Nabiki asked.  Ranma shook his head pulling something out his mouth.  It was an eggshell.  Everyone grew quiet.  Faint sobbing noises came from  upstairs.  Ranma looked at everyone  sadly.  He had his work cut out for  him.  He got up slowly and made his way  to Akane's room.</p><p>He approached her door.  She was taking it pretty hard despite the fact it wasn't his  fault.  He knocked on it softly.</p><p>"Go away you stupid jerk!"  Akane demanded.</p><p>"B-but Akane…" Ranma tried.</p><p>"No need to explain yourself Ranma!  Just go ahead and say it!  I'll never learn to cook right!"</p><p>"No…that's not it…its just that."</p><p>"It's what Ranma?   The taste, the smell?  I worked  all morning on that for you but…"</p><p>"But what?" Ranma asked, trying to be sympathetic.</p><p>"But…you still didn't appreciate it!"  Akane yelled.</p><p>"N…no.   That's not it Akane.  It's  just…well…"</p><p>"oh…ok I get it."   Akane said, opening the door and handing Ranma a gift-wrapped box.  The box was covered in bright red paper with  little sparkles on it.  A blue bow  finished off the wrapping.  Akane promptly  slammed the door.  Ranma heard the door  lock.</p><p>"Happy now Ranma?"   Akane asked from inside.</p><p>Ranma held the box.   It was kind of light.  A hurt  feeling suddenly passed over him, hearing the muffled sobs of Akane.</p><p>"Look Akane…the truth is that…"</p><p>"Just…go away Ranma!  I don't feel like talking any more!"</p><p>Ranma's anger rose, combining itself with his  feelings of hurt.</p><p>"Damn it Akane!   That was the best cake I ever had!   All that happened was I choked on a stupid eggshell!"  Ranma yelled through the door.</p><p>Akane sat in her room; hearing was Ranma had yelled  to her.  She heard his door close  loudly.  Her tears dried themselves.  Akane still felt hurt, but for a different  reason now.</p><p>"The best cake he ever had?"  Akane said to herself.  She got up and opened her door.  Everyone was down stairs, except for Ranma,  who was locked in his room.  She  approached his door, knocking softly.</p><p>"What?"   Ranma demanded.</p><p>"Can I come in?"</p><p>"Can't stop ya."</p><p>Akane entered his room.  Ranma lay on his bed, his arms behind his head.  His present was next to him, unopened.</p><p>Akane sat down next to him, sadly.  Ranma did not look over to her, but kept  staring at the ceiling.</p><p>The two sat there for a few moments in silence.</p><p>"Well…what do you want?"  Ranma asked, still looking at the ceiling.</p><p>Akane grabbed Ranma's hand, making him pay full  attention.</p><p>"I'm sorry I overreacted Ranma."  Akane said apologetically.  "It's just that I was so afraid you wouldn't  like that cake.  I worked really hard  trying to perfect it, and when you started choking like that…"</p><p>"Yea I know…everyone thought I was playin' around,  until I wouldn't stop coughing."</p><p>Akane reached over and grabbed Ranma's gift.  "Well, I'm sorry Ranma."  She said, handing the gift to him.  "Can you forgive me?"</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane, holding his gift to him like  some sort of peace offering.  He  couldn't help but smile.</p><p>"Yea…I'll forgive you.  Sometimes you are so un-cute though…"</p><p>"I know…well…you gonna open it?"  Akane couldn't help but smile, seeing  Ranma's forgiving look.</p><p>Ranma obliged, tearing the paper and revealing the  combo Akane had got him.  He smiled to  Akane.</p><p>"Do you like it?"   She asked; a bit embarrassed.</p><p>"I love it!   Thanks Akane."  Ranma said  happily.  The two sat there a few  moments.  Something needed to be done…</p><p>"Oh, what the heck, it's your birthday."  Akane said, sliding over to Ranma and giving  him a big hug.  Ranma happily returned  the hug.</p><p>"Don't get to used to that Ranma.  I only did that for your birthday" Akane  said in defense of her actions.</p><p>"Yea, whatever, you know you liked that as much as I  did."  Ranma said playfully.</p><p>"D-did not!"   Akane countered.  "That was just  a part of your birthday present."</p><p>"Sure…whatever Akane."  Ranma returned, smiling.</p><p>"Hmph, well maybe I'll just leave you here  then!"  Akane said, turning around.</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane confused.  Akane sensed this, smiling to herself.</p><p>"Well I was gonna go to the movies with <i>someone</i>.  Guess I'll have to find someone else that  appreciates me.  Maybe…"</p><p>"Hey…wait a second Akane!"  Ranma said, sitting in front of her.</p><p>Akane turned her head, feigning anger.  "Maybe Ukyo would like to come with me.  Or maybe Nabiki…"</p><p>"Hey…come on Akane.   I thought you would be cuter on <i>my</i> birthday"</p><p>"Well…in that case I guess me and Ukyo will just go  see <i>The Matrix."</i></p><p>"Oh come on Akane.   I asked you first."</p><p>"So…does that mean you <i>want</i> to go with me to  the movies?"  Akane asked with her cute  smile.  Ranma couldn't resist.</p><p>"Yea…I heard it was a good movie.  I guess it really doesn't matter <i>who</i>  I go with…just as long as I go."</p><p>"Well fine Ranma, have fun with who ever it is  that's going with you."  Akane said, leaving  the room.</p><p>"Wait a sec Akane, I did kinda want to see it with  you…" Ranma finally admitted.</p><p>Akane whirled around, triumphantly smiling.  "See, told ya!  I knew you wanted to go on a date with me."</p><p>"Well, its not that…just that you had the money…I'm  kinda broke right now."</p><p>"<i>Sure</i> Ranma…well the movie starts at  3:30.  Be ready by then."</p><p>"Ok Akane."   Ranma said.  The two left each  other to prepare.  Ranma finished his  slice of cake, finding a few more eggshells in it.  It was pretty good, although it had a funny aftertaste.  That didn't matter.  The fact that Akane put her heart in it  covered up the aftertaste, and that's all that Ranma cared about in actuality.  It really was the best cake he ever had, not  based on flavor but based on who it was from.</p><p><u>The Best  of Times…The Worst of Times</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane started to the theatre.  Ranma was wearing his new combo that Akane  had got for him.  It did look very nice  on him, and the fabric was soft and loose, just like Ranma liked it.</p><p>"Hey Akane…that was a nice fight yesterday.  I saw you win that match against Ukyo.  You did a great job."  Ranma started, forgetting <i>why</i> he knew  about the match</p><p>Akane looked at him suspiciously.  "Hey…how did you know about that  tournament?"</p><p>Once again, Ranma did not think before  speaking.  "Well…I…uh."</p><p>"You were spying on me weren't you?"</p><p>"Well not really…I just wanted to see what you were  doing…" Ranma said unconvincingly.</p><p>"Yes you were Ranma.  How else would you know about it?"</p><p>"Well, it's just that I wanted to see what was so  important to you.  Besides, that  100,000-yen will help out a lot at the Dojo."</p><p>"Well Ranma, if you must know what was so important,  I entered the tournament to get the money to buy you those clothes you are  wearing now."</p><p>"Well, thanks for doing that for me, I was just  kinda sad is all.  I uh…really did want  to see the movie with you.  You know…we  really haven't been out on a date like this…"</p><p>"Yea…I guess you're right… one time we tried…" Akane  broke off her sentence, remembering that attempted date so long ago.  All those sad feelings had come back.  She had hoped to forget that day. Ranma also  wanted to forget that day.  So many  things were said that he couldn't take back.   The couple walked in silence a few more blocks.</p><p>"Hey Akane?   What was that move Ukyo used where she split up her image?  I didn't think she could do something like  that…"</p><p>"Oh, that was one of the techniques of the Seven  Swords School.  It was called <i>Wakareji  Kyuuten."</i></p><p>"Did she tell you how she learned that so fast?  That was pretty amazing, but she made the  mistake of using it twice in a row."</p><p>"Yea…she told me it was kinda like Martial Arts  Calligraphy.  There was a strange little  mark on the handle of the spatula.  She  said that enabled her to "let go" of the weapon and let it execute the  attack.  She told me that in the school,  people train by sparing with their own weapons."</p><p>"Wow…that's pretty incredible."</p><p>"Yea she had me stumped the first time.  The second time I noticed the pattern and  struck back."</p><p>"Yea and you ended up almost falling out of the ring  a little after that." Ranma said with a smile.</p><p>Akane blushed a bit.  "Yea…that was kinda bad wasn't it?"</p><p>"No, I saw you recover from that position.  All that training from Cologne has paid  off."</p><p>Akane thought for a minute.  "Speaking of Cologne, where did she  disappear to?  She hasn't been by in  about two weeks."</p><p>"Dunno…maybe we can stop by the Kat Café later  on.  I'm sure they haven't moved yet."</p><p>"I hope not, I kinda wanted to thank them both for  helping us so."</p><p>Ranma and Akane entered the theatre.  Akane bought the tickets and some  munchies.  Ranma ordered the large  popcorn.  Akane got some sort of strange  chocolates.</p><p>The two sat close to each other during the  movie.  Akane was eating out of Ranma's  popcorn.  In retaliation, Ranma stole  some of her chocolates.  After about  three hours the movie ended.  Ranma and  Akane left the theatre, going on and on about how the movie was.</p><p>Akane looked up to the sky.  It was about 6:30 or somewhere along that  time.  "Hey Ranma…it's still kinda  early.  Let's go take a walk in the  park.  This warm air is nice isn't it?"</p><p>"Yea it sure is."   Ranma said, walking along side of Akane.  They reached the park.   The birds seemed to say hello.  A  cool breeze was blowing, moving the leaves around ever so gently.  Akane leaned on Ranma's form.  Ranma placed his arm around her.  It was very quiet…and relaxing.</p><p>"You know…this is really nice…being together like  this…finally."  Akane said, smiling up  to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma smiled down to her.  "Yea you're right…this is kinda nice.  Finally, peace of mind.   Nothin' to worry about.  No  stupid fiancées to try and get rid of."</p><p>They continued to walk along the path.  Akane perked up.</p><p>"Hey…someone is coming."  She said, getting a bit tense.</p><p>"Feh, don't worry about it.  If they see us like this so what?  We're both happy like this right?"</p><p>"No…I mean I think its Shampoo.  I think I can hear her voice."</p><p>Ranma listened closely.  "I think I can hear her too.   It's coming from those bushes over there.  Sounds like someone else is there."</p><p>The couple separated, wondering what was going  on.  They neared the bushes.  They could hear it plainly now.  It was Shampoo and Mousse.</p><p>"I wonder what they are doin'?"  Ranma said.</p><p>"I dunno."   Akane said, pushing a few leaves out the way.  "Maybe they are here in the park because Shampoo loves Mousse  now."</p><p>"Man I hope so…" Ranma said, listening.  They could hear the conversation now.</p><p>"…but why not Shampoo?  I love you.  I always  have."  Mousse pleaded.</p><p>Shampoo stood in front of him, her arms  crossed.  She wasn't interested in  talking.</p><p>"Shampoo, just give me one more chance!"</p><p>"No Mousse!   You ruin Shampoo's life!  You  stole Ranma from Shampoo.  Shampoo never  forgive you for that!"  She said, turning  and yelling at him.</p><p>Ranma and Akane's eyes widened.</p><p>"But Shampoo, Ranma already had a fiancée.  Admit it.   Akane would have suited Ranma better than you could have.  For one he actually loved her.  He just tolerated your…"</p><p>"You shut up!   Shampoo loved Ranma with all her heart.   And Mousse had to interfere with that stupid Akane.  Ranma would have been mine if Mousse had not  interfered."</p><p>"But Shampoo…you lost the "Duel of the fates"  against Akane.  That means you have to  give up Ranma to her."</p><p>"No, Shampoo only lost because Mousse found secret  book and gave it to Akane.  Shampoo  could have easily beat Akane…"</p><p>"Shampoo, just forget about Ranma…those two are  going to get married really soon."</p><p>"Ranma would have married Shampoo if Mousse wasn't  such a stupid!"</p><p>"But Shampoo…"</p><p>"Shampoo finished talking Mousse!"  She said, storming off.</p><p>Ranma turned around, seemingly unconcerned.  "Well, that kinda sucks.  I was hoping those two would get  together.  Oh well…" Ranma started off  to the Dojo.</p><p>Akane looked behind her seeing Ranma walk away.  "Ranma…are you just going to leave poor  Mousse like that?"</p><p>"Well yea…what has he done for me?  All he ever did was try to kill me.  Just leave him be, he will be fine."</p><p>"But Ranma…didn't yea hear what Shampoo was saying?"</p><p>Ranma turned around, puzzled.</p><p>"Ranma…I won that duel against Shampoo because  Mousse was the one that gave me that strange book with all the techniques."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"<i>So</i> Ranma…we owe it to him to help him out  when he needs it.  He helped both of us  back then when we needed it."</p><p>"Nah…I bet you could've beat Shampoo without all  those techniques."</p><p>"I don't think so Ranma.  During that fight, Shampoo's speed matched yours.  I could barely lay a hand on you…"</p><p>"Well whatever, we should stay out of this."</p><p>"No Ranma…I'm going to help Mousse.  He helped me get the most important thing to  me and I'm not just gonna sit here and watch the most important thing to him  turn her back on him."  Akane said,  going through the bushes and approaching Mousse.</p><p>"Geeze…alright then."  Ranma said.  Maybe all  their troubles weren't over yet…</p><p>"Mousse!   What's wrong?"  Akane asked,  sitting next to him on the near by bench.</p><p>"Akane…Ranma?   What are you two doing here?"   Mousse asked, straightening out.</p><p>"Well, Ranma and I were going for a walk when we  overheard you two arguing.  We decided  to stop by and see what was wrong."</p><p>"So…you heard everything then huh?"</p><p>"Yes…thanks for your help Mousse.  I should have figured it out sooner."</p><p>"You're welcome Akane…it's just that…I thought  Shampoo would come to her senses if she lost to you."</p><p>"Well…you can't give up.  Not after all the effort you put into this."</p><p>"Yes I know…but she won't even give me the time of  day.  It's like she hates me…"</p><p>"I could see why she does," Ranma said.  Akane turned to him sternly.</p><p>"Ranma!  That  was not a nice thing to say to poor Mousse.   Can't you see he's hurt enough?"</p><p>"Geeze…come on Akane.  That guy tried to kill me hundreds of times.  Now you're feelin' sorry for him?"</p><p>"Saotome…" Mousse started, turning to him.  "Maybe that was the wrong way to go about it  back then…but I had to do something…I couldn't let Shampoo leave me like that."</p><p>"Well still…I remember at one point you kidnapped  Akane…I can't forgive you that easily."   Ranma said, folding his arms.</p><p>"Oh come on Ranma…Mousse is sincerely sorry about  what he did.  He needs our help now and  I'm not going to let him down…not after what he did for me."</p><p>"Fine…whatever Akane, I still don't like him  though…"</p><p>Akane ignored Ranma and started to think for a few  moments.</p><p>"Hey Mousse…Ranma defeated Shampoo a long time ago  right?  That forced her into her  engagement with him.  Maybe if…"</p><p>"No, that wouldn't work.  I have tried since the age of three.  Shampoo is just too skilled for me.  I need to think of another way…"</p><p>Mousse and Akane sat there, thinking for a few  moments.  Ranma was leaning against a  tree wondering why Akane was so suddenly worried about his enemy.</p><p>"Hey…wait a second Mousse…there may be a way you can  win against Shampoo."  Akane said,  turning to him.  Mousse looked at her,  his eyes were hopeful.</p><p>"Ranma beat Shampoo once…and that started all this  trouble.  I'll bet if Ranma trained you,  you could easily defeat Shampoo."</p><p>"That ain't gonna happen Akane.'  Ranma demanded.  "Why should I help out Mousse?   Just because of that stupid book?"</p><p>"You should forgive Mousse for doing what he  did.  It was for love…you know how love  can be sometimes."</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes, saying nothing.</p><p>"Well then, since Ranma is acting like a big jerk, I  guess I'll have to train Mousse.  After  all, I did beat Shampoo once too."</p><p>Ranma leaned against the tree, his arms  crossed.  "Good luck Akane.  You're gonna need it."</p><p>"I don't need luck Ranma, I'm confident that Mousse  can beat Shampoo once and for all."  Akane  turned to Mousse.  "Well what do you  think?"</p><p>"S…sure Akane.   I would appreciate any help you could offer."</p><p>"Good!  Meet  me tomorrow at the Dojo and we can begin then."  Akane said.  Mousse  nodded.</p><p>"Well…see you then Mousse…it's almost dinner time."</p><p>With that, Ranma and Akane started to the Dojo.  Mousse went in the opposite direction,  hopeful that Akane would come through.</p><p>"What was your problem back there Ranma?"  Akane asked.</p><p>"I just don't trust that guy yet.  Yea…he may have helped you with that book  but…"</p><p>"But what?"</p><p>"Bah…just forget it.  I just don't like him."</p><p>"Well suit yourself Ranma."  Akane said, walking ahead of him.</p><p>The two reached the Dojo.  They sat and ate, not saying much to each other, aside from  polite conversation.</p><p>"Oh Ranma…Miss Ukyo came over today while you two  were at the movies.  I told her you  would get back with her later.  She left  you a special gift."  Kasumi said,  smiling and handing Ranma a small box.</p><p>Ranma opened it.   Inside were all you can eat passes at Uc-Chan's.  Ranma smiled.  It was a set of two.  One  was for Akane.</p><p>"I guess I'll just stop by tomorrow.  I'll bet she is closed for the night."  Ranma said.</p><p>Dinner was finished in its normal manner.  Ranma sat in his bed, pondering.  At least he wouldn't be bored tomorrow.</p><p><u>The First  Steps</u></p><p>Ranma awoke that morning.  His mind went immediately to Akane's promise to help Mousse.  "Man…why is she doing that…things will work  out fine with out us interfering."   Ranma thought to himself.  He got  up form his bed and went down stairs for breakfast.</p><p>"Well Ranma…have you thought about Mousse at  all?"  Akane asked, emerging from her  room.  Ranma turned around.</p><p>"I told you…I don't like that guy.  I can't be as forgiving as you Akane."  Ranma suddenly realized what he said.  Akane was forgiving…</p><p>"Well I'm still gonna help him out.  He needs it."  Akane said, passing Ranma on the stairs.  Ranma followed, sitting down and starting breakfast.</p><p>"Akane was forgiving of Mousse…" Ranma thought to  himself.  "Come to think of it…she  always had a soft spot for people when they needed help.  She helped Ryoga a couple of times…Maybe she  just felt sorry for him…" Ranma continued to think about the subject, seeming  to find out just a little bit more about his would-be wife.</p><p>A knock came from the door shortly after  breakfast.  Mousse was at the door,  standing there with his arms in his massive sleeves.  Akane showed him to the training hall.  She was dressed in her Gi.   Ranma decided to accompany them, a bit curious on exactly how Akane was  going to go through all this.</p><p>Akane stood across from Mousse.  She glanced at Ranma, who was sitting next  to the wall.  She returned her focus to  Mousse.  "Ok Mousse.  Come at me with all you have.  We will start there."</p><p>Mousse nodded and dashed to Akane with a high  kick.  Akane ducked the blow.  The training had started.</p><p>Ranma watched for a bit.  Akane had improved a lot, but she was still no match for  him.  Going at that rate, Mousse would  just barely win against Shampoo, if he did at all.</p><p>Ranma watched for a little while.  Akane was trying her best.  "Akane sure looks determined about all  this."  Ranma said to himself.  "She seems to trust that Mousse guy…but I  don't know…after all he did to us…Well, we'll just see after a few weeks won't  we Akane?"  Ranma watched for a few more  minutes, before deciding to do something else.   He just got up and left the two training there.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…where you going?"  Akane asked, a bit concerned.</p><p>"Oh…I'm just gonna stop by Uc-Chan's for a little  while.  You two can keep training."</p><p>"You know Ranma…we could use your help…" Akane said.</p><p>"Nah…" Ranma returned simply.  He walked out the door, leaving a slightly  angered Akane and an amazed Mousse.   That book he gave Akane really helped a lot.</p><p>Ranma walked in Uc-Chan's</p><p>"Hey Ran-Chan!   Happy Birthday!"  Ukyo said,  coming over to him.  Ranma sat down at  his favorite seat.  Ukyo sat across from  him.</p><p>"Hey Ran-Chan…what's with the long face?"  Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Huh?"  Ranma  didn't realize he was thinking that hard.   "Well Uc-Chan…it's like this…Akane took me to the movies yesterday for  my birthday and after the movie we took a little walk in the park."</p><p>"Oh…how romantic" Ukyo said, trying to bring up  Ranma's spirits</p><p>"Yea…anyway we came across Mousse and Shampoo.  They are arguing as usual.  Of course Akane had to butt in, offering to  train Mousse so he could beat Shampoo once and for all."</p><p>"Well Ran-Chan…is that so bad?"</p><p>"Well…no not really I guess.  It's just that…I really don't trust that  guy…I get a funny feeling about him whenever he is around."</p><p>"Well, I don't blame you, after all the times he's  tried to kill you."</p><p>"I dunno Uc-Chan…Akane seems to have forgiven Mousse  for everything.  I think it's a little  to fast for all that.  Mousse was the  one that helped Akane win against Shampoo."</p><p>Ukyo perked up.   "Really?  How so?"</p><p>"He was the one that gave her that book with all the  techniques in it."</p><p>"Well…isn't that enough of a peace offering? I  mean…he did play a pretty big part in bringing you two together."</p><p>"Yea…I guess so…Akane seems to think that way…but  still…"</p><p>"Well…but what Ran-Chan?"</p><p>Ranma crossed his arms.  "I dunno…I guess I'm afraid he will hurt Akane.  This might be another one of his ploys you  know."</p><p>"I don't think so Ranma.  Akane is a good judge of character.  I think she would know if something was gonna happen."</p><p>"I don't think so.   Akane completely mis-judged Ryoga.   She was always helping him out without knowing about him."</p><p>"What about Ryoga?"</p><p>Ranma turned to Ukyo.  "What do you mean?  Don't  tell me you didn't know his secret."</p><p>"Oh…that whole P-Chan thing.  Yea I knew that…but that was different from  what is happening now."</p><p>"But still…"</p><p>"Oh come on Ranma.   Mousse isn't plotting against you two.   If he was, you know that Akane could easily handle her own against  him.  I think you should trust him a bit  more.  All he ever wanted was Shampoo  and I doubt he would throw away his best chance to get her."</p><p>Ranma sighed a bit.   "Maybe you're right Uc-Chan.   Maybe I'm just a bit too over protective of Akane.  She prolly knows what she is doing."</p><p>"Or Ranma…you could look at it like this.  The sooner Mousse beats Shampoo the sooner  those two would leave you alone."</p><p>"Yea…I guess you're right…"</p><p>Ukyo smiled.   "You know…I'll be they could use a hand from the first person to beat  Shampoo."</p><p>"Well…I'll just see how Akane is doing.  Then I'll make my decision.  Thanks Uc-Chan, you are really a good  friend.  I saw that match with you and  Akane.  You did pretty good."</p><p>Ukyo blushed.   "R-really…you think so?"</p><p>Ranma smiled.   "Yea of course.  It takes a lot  of skill to keep up with Akane, especially as of late with her constant  training.  Well, I'm gonna go back to  the dojo.  Thanks for your gift, expect  me back really soon."  Ranma smiled at  Ukyo before leaving.  He noticed that  she had closed her shop just to talk with him.   Ukyo was a really good friend.</p><p>Ukyo watched as Ranma left.  She smiled, a tear of happiness coming down  her cheek.  "Ranma is so nice  sometimes…no wonder I still love him…" Ukyo said.  She looked to the closed sign.   It was then she noticed she was crying.   Maybe she should stay closed…at least until she regained  herself.</p><p><u>A Change  of Heart</u></p><p>Ranma entered the Dojo late that evening.  He had walked all around town, thinking  about what Ukyo was telling him.  Could  he really trust Mousse?</p><p>Ranma went into the training hall.  Akane was there, training by herself.</p><p>"Hey Akane?   Where did Mousse run off to?"</p><p>"Oh, we finished our session for today.  Mousse has a lot to learn."</p><p>"So do you Akane.   You may be a bit faster and have a few special techniques, but you still  need to polish them to make them better."</p><p>"What do you think I'm doing right now?"</p><p>Ranma said nothing.   Akane went back to her training.</p><p>"Maybe you should take a break or somethin'" Ranma  finally said.</p><p>"No, I can't.   Not until I'm a match for you."</p><p>"Well remember, it took me ten years of trainin' to  get as good as I am now…not to mention a certain trip to a certain area of  cursed springs."</p><p>"If that's how long it takes…" Akane said, going  back to her training yet again.</p><p>"Hey Akane…you don't really think you can train  Mousse to beat Shampoo do you?  I  mean…you barely won that duel if I remember right."</p><p>Akane stopped; frustrated that Ranma kept  interrupting him.  "Ranma…I have to do  something to help.  I just can't leave  poor Mousse like that.  You know good  and well what he did for us.  I intend  to repay him for his kindness."</p><p>"But Akane…you could use more training  yourself…kinda like the blind leadin' the blind."</p><p>"Well Ranma…it's certainly a lot better than  standing by and doing nothing."  Akane  said coldly.</p><p>Ranma was a bit stunned.  She was deathly serious about this.</p><p>The Hall door slid open.  It was Kasumi.</p><p>"Oh My…aren't we having fun in here.  Dinner is ready if you want to take a  break."  Kasumi said with a smile.  Akane returned the smile, walking past  Ranma.  Ranma could almost feel the cold  of her shoulder against his cheek.</p><p>Ranma sat quietly at the table.  Akane seemed to be in a good mood, despite  the fact that he was not helping.  Soon  everyone finished dinner.  Soun and  Genma were busy with helping Nabiki decide on a good college to attend.  She had graduated a week or so ago.  Nabiki wasn't all that worried.  She had the money.  Kasumi went to clean up the dinner table.  Akane went up stairs.  She was a bit tired after today.  All that was left of the household was  Ranma.  He decided to call it a night  too.</p><p>He lay in his bed, thinking a bit.  "Could I really trust Mousse?  I guess if Akane did then…" Ranma was  confused.  He didn't' want Akane around  that creepy guy, but on the other hand, he did kind of want to help them.  If only he could trust Mousse.</p><p>Ranma awoke the next morning, hearing strange sounds  coming form the training hall.  That  must be Akane and Mousse.  Ranma went to  investigate, grabbing a few goodies off the breakfast table.  He entered the Training hall, seeing Akane  and Mousse going all out.  Akane was the  clear favorite in that fight, but her skills still seemed rough around the  edges…Ranma smiled to himself.</p><p>Akane noticed Ranma was again watching them.  "Well…what do you want now?"  She asked, a bit out of breath.</p><p>"Nothin' just watchin'" Ranma said simply.  Akane went back to her training.</p><p>"You know Akane…rather than teach Mousse how to use  his skills…you should be working on his speed first."</p><p>"Oh what do you know Ranma?"  Akane demanded.  "At least I'm trying!"</p><p>Ranma smiled a bit.   "Here Akane…let me help you out a bit."   He said, standing next to Akane and facing Mousse.  "You can take a break, I'll handle this."  Mousse and Akane looked at Ranma confused.</p><p>"What are you doing Ranma?"  Akane finally asked.  He turned to Akane, smiling that confident  smile of his.  "Well…I'm gonna help out  a friend."  He said simply.  He turned to Mousse.  "Ok, come on Mousse.  We have a lot of training to do."</p><p>Akane and Mousse stood there, a bit stunned.</p><p>"Ranma?"   Akane asked</p><p>"I'll take it from here Akane.  I figure if you could trust Mousse, then so  could I."</p><p>"Saotome…after all I did to you…you would still help  me?"  Mousse asked.  That usual fire inside him had  vanished.  Ranma had never seen this  side of Mousse.</p><p>"Sure…whatever.   I mean there was no way you were gonna win with Akane's training.  So I guess I kinda have no choice."</p><p>Mousse smiled.   He soon recovered his bearings.   "Thanks."</p><p>"Yea…thanks for helping us Ranma."  Akane offered, even after hearing Ranma's  reasoning behind his decision, she was still happy.</p><p>"Hey Akane…stick around a bit.  Maybe you could learn something to."</p><p>Akane nodded.</p><p>Ranma faced Mousse.   "Ok, come at me when you are ready.   Just try to land a blow" Ranma said, confidently</p><p>"That I will Ranma Saotome!"  Mousse said, charging after him.</p><p>Akane watched the two spar.  She was satisfied.  Maybe…just maybe…Shampoo and Mousse would find each other.</p><p>*****haha! Another update on time! How about that?  Well, hope you liked this one. This I wrote for all you Shampoo/Mousse fans. I  believe the next two chapters deals with that little problem. That puts us at  Chapter 14 or so. But I forget what happens after that. I know what happens  about chapter 17 or so. Or do I? Well, trust me. Whatever happens, it's real  good! This is the part of the fic I got comfortable on writing and found my  style, so it's only up hill form here. And thanks for the reviews guys! I  really appreciate it! Well now, I'm off again. Gonna have a hamburger. Mmmm. Burger….  Hehe. Until next we meet!*****</p>
