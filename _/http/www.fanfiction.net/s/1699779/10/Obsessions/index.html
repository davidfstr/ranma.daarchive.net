</div><p>Chapter Ten</p><p><u>Desperation</u></p><p>Akane stood in the training hall, facing  Cologne.  She eyed her intensely.  "I have to stop these stupid emotions.  They aren't me and they never were."  Akane was determined to fight herself, tooth  and nail.  She cleared her mind, not  remembering the last time she was able to think so clearly.  She took her stance.  Cologne lead off.</p><p>She swung her staff at Akane's head.  Akane placed a forearm up; blocking the  blow. The force of the blow made her slide a few steps back.  Akane launched a right to Cologne; instead  she caught the brunt of her staff.  It  was like a rod of iron.  Akane tried a  left, again finding the staff blocking her way.</p><p>"Akane, you must clear your mind <i>completely</i>  or you will have no hope of mastering your arts. "  Cologne said, amidst her attacks.</p><p>"She's right."   Akane said to herself.  "My mind  really isn't all that clear… so much stuff to worry about."  Akane continued to train, despite her  feelings.</p><p>Shampoo turned to Ranma, who was sitting a little  bit away from her.  "Is Akane ok?"  She asked, concerned</p><p>"I dunno Shampoo."   Ranma started.  "She has been  actin' real funny since last night."</p><p>"Last night!   What you two do?"  Shampoo asked  hurriedly.</p><p>"Well, Akane told me about a test we had and she  offered to help me study a bit, on the condition I taste her cooking again."  Shampoo winced in pain for Ranma.  He  continued.  "All of a sudden, Akane  seemed to start feelin' real bad.  She  started running a fever and sweating and shaking all over, like she had a cold or  flu or somethin'.  Of course she  wouldn't tell me what was wrong.  Then  at school, it looked like she got better, but then sank right back down, almost  like she was depressed.  She's been that  way up until you guys showed up, now she looks like she could halfway kill a  person.  I'm tellin' ya, she can be so  strange sometimes…"</p><p>"Is very strange Ranma.  You want Shampoo and great-Grandmother to help?"</p><p>"Well it may come down to that, but if I know Akane,  she will prolly try to solo whatever is bothering her.  She even tried that with a real cold once…"</p><p>"Shampoo's great-Grandmother know lots of  medicine.  Can fix Akane up very fast."</p><p>"Thanks Shampoo, I'll keep you two in mind.  Right now though…I dunno, Akane doesn't seem  like herself."</p><p>"Akane be fine Ranma" Shampoo said.  Ranma was starting to worry.</p><p>"Yea…"</p><p>Akane leaped into the air, coming down with a flying  kick to Cologne.  Cologne sidestepped  the kick, planting her staff firmly in Akane's ribs.  Akane was flung backwards, landing hard against the wall.  The pain Akane experienced had made her  forget about her troubles.  For a few  brief seconds, Akane was focused on her training and that alone.</p><p>"Hey Akane!   You can do better than that!"   Ranma cheered from the sidelines, smiling a bit.  Akane made the mistake of turning to see  him.  That pressure in her chest  returned.  It seemed to sap all of her  strength.  Cologne hopped up to her,  examining her condition.  Akane looked  up to her, in pain.  It wasn't from the  blow she had received.  It was from somewhere  within.  Cologne eyed Akane closely,  Akane started to get a bit worried.  Did  she know what she was feeling?</p><p>"Akane…something is troubling you.  There is a conflict with in you.  Two halves of the same person are fighting  to gain control of your mind.  Until you  decide which side wins, I will not be able to help you train.  Your mind must be clear to reflect on your  mistakes and learn from them.  You may  come and see me once your decision is made.   Let us go Shampoo, we must watch the Café."</p><p>With that, Cologne and Shampoo left.  Ranma looked at Akane, still sitting on the  floor.</p><p>He approached her.   "What was she talking about Akane?   Two sides of the same person?   Did somethin' happen to you?''</p><p>"No…nothing happened Ranma…I just…" Akane stopped  abruptly.  No telling what kind of words  would come out of her mouth.</p><p>Ranma offered her a hand.  Akane grabbed it, softly. She rose to her feet, keeping her head  down.  She took a step away from  Ranma.  Her body seemed to react by  itself, tripping, and forcing her into Ranma's arms.  Ranma grabbed her, trying to stabilize her.</p><p>"Hey…you ok Akane?   Did you get hurt that bad?"</p><p>Akane did not answer.  She moved her arms behind Ranma, giving him a gentle hug.  That made her feel so much better; to be  holding Ranma.  The weight had lifted  off her chest.  She was at peace.  She tightened her grip on Ranma, placing her  head on his chest.  She wanted to stay  like this…</p><p>"Uh…Akane?" Ranma asked, tapping her on the  head.  Abruptly, Akane looked up, she  had lost herself again.  She backed away  from Ranma, turning her head away from him.   She turned her head down to the ground, walking past Ranma silently.</p><p>Ranma watched her.   "Geeze…what was that all about?   Something is seriously wrong with Akane." Ranma said to himself, sitting  down in front of the TV.</p><p>Akane sat in her room, she was angry with herself  for what she had done. She took a deep breath.   "It's like…my body moved on its own back there, like someone was  controlling me…Well, I sure felt better after that little moment…"</p><p>Akane went to her mirror, inspecting herself.  She turned her body each and every way.  Yes.   She did have a smile on.  She was  happy, happy that the weight in her chest had been lifted.</p><p>"I wonder how Ranma felt…I hope he's not mad or  anything.  Actually, to be honest, he's  probably more confused than I am."   Akane felt that warmth rise from with in her again.  It came suddenly, her limbs started to get  weak.  Something was different about  those feelings this time…Like they weren't as strong.</p><p>"Well, whatever he's feeling, I have to get to the  bottom of this…" Akane's mind seemed to work better than it had in previous  hours.  She was not scared of her  feelings any more, but they did feel alien to her and for that reason she  wanted to figure out what was wrong.   Akane thought to herself for a few minutes.  Ranma would definitely be out.   Nabiki was <i>going</i> to help her, but when?  She had ruled out the rest of the family.  Maybe Ukyo?   Nah…she seemed to still be depressed about her losing Ranma.  There was one person that could help her, a  person that was always there for her.   Akane arose from her bed, changing into one of her less fancy  dresses.  She opened her door, looking  for anyone.  Everyone was  downstairs.  Akane walked down stairs,  past everyone, heading for the door.</p><p>"Hey Akane, where are you going?"  Soun asked.</p><p>"Oh…well…I forgot to see Dr. Tofu the other day, so  I felt like now was a good time…"</p><p>"Oh, that's good." Soun said, looking towards  Nabiki.  Nabiki gestured to Ranma.</p><p>"Why not take Ranma with you?"  He asked.</p><p>"Well, It looks like he is busy right now…I hate to  drag him along."</p><p>"Yea, I'll just wait here until dinner."</p><p>"No Ranma, as Akane's fiancée, you two must get used  to doing things like this together," Genma said fiercely.</p><p>"Hey Pops what'cha mean "things like this?' This  don't got nothin' to do with me"</p><p>"Ranma…you hurt your father…here I was, thinking  that you two had finally started to get long."</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes.  "Well, we are starting to get along…"</p><p>"Then act like it Ranma!  Besides, can't you see that Akane seems to have fallen ill?  If something happened to her, you would  never forgive yourself."</p><p>"Nothin' is gonna happen to Akane."  Ranma said under his breath.  He got up from his TV and walked after  Akane, who had already left.</p><p>Genma turned to everyone and smiled.  Nabiki nodded.  "Good job Mr. Saotome.   Now…this gives us about an hour to get everything ready.  I've written a note for those two.  Everything else is up to you guys."</p><p>Everyone nodded.   Kasumi went to finish her special dinner.  Soun and Genma had a plan of their own.</p><p><u>Realizations</u></p><p>Ranma walked behind Akane, in his usual, unconcerned  manner.  Akane was a few feet in front  of him, pondering.</p><p>"I hope Tofu-sensei can help me.  If he couldn't then no one could.  It's strange really…somehow…it's like I knew  this was coming.  I sure hope we can  figure out something.  Who knows what I  would do to Ranma next."</p><p>Akane heard footsteps behind her.  She turned to the sound.  It was Ranma, walking behind her, seeming to  be in his own little world.  Akane's  heart jumped, she had wanted to do this alone.   Ranma might overhear her conversation.</p><p>"Ranma!  What  are you doing here?"  She asked.</p><p>"Pops told me to keep an eye on you, just incase you  got mugged or fainted or somethin'."</p><p>"Well Ranma, you know perfectly well I can handle  anything myself.  You should just go  home."  Akane really didn't mean  that.  She wanted to be close Ranma.</p><p>"Nah…I really don't wanna go back there.  Did everyone seem to act funny to you?"</p><p>"N…no…" Akane said, turning around, her eyes were  going places they shouldn't have gone.</p><p>"I have got to stop this," She said to herself,  entering Dr. Tofu's clinic.</p><p>"Yes…how can I…Oh, hi Akane.  I see your husband is accompanying you" Tofu  said with a smile.</p><p>"Hey Tofu-sensei" Ranma said.  Akane walked into that little, familiar  room.  Ranma followed.  He was kind of bored.</p><p>"So Akane, what's troubling you?  Marital problems?  Strange feelings that you can't explain?"</p><p>Akane's eyes widened.  "Oh no!   How did  Tofu-sensei figure it out so fast?   Damn! Ranma is in here…what am I gonna do?"</p><p>"Just kidding Akane.  Why did you get that look all of a sudden?"</p><p>"Uh…well…"</p><p>"Anyway Akane, what seem to be the problem?"</p><p>Akane gained her resolve back.  Ranma leaned himself in a corner,  daydreaming.</p><p>"Well Tofu-sensei.   I think I'm coming down with something.   I was shaking all over and sweating real bad.  Ranma said I had a fever."</p><p>"Ok…" Tofu said, examining Akane.  His palpitations over vital areas did not elicit  a response.</p><p>A few moments passed.  "Well Akane…seems like you're your usual, healthy self.  I can't seem to find anything wrong with you  physically.  Even your spirits seem very  high, suggesting that you feel very confident about something."</p><p>Akane looked up to Tofu and smiled.  "Well, thank you for your help  Tofu-sensei."  Akane got up and started  back to the Dojo.  Ranma continued to  dwell in his little world. Akane would be fine, he better not interfere.</p><p>"I'm…fine?"   Akane asked herself.  "Come to  think of it…all that shaking and sweating is gone.  I am able to think straight.   Only those stupid visions of me and Ranma and that warm feeling are  left.  This is very strange.  I wonder…" Akane thought for a few minutes,  contemplating her next move.  She was  thinking about what happened in the training hall.</p><p>"Ah!  I have  an idea!"  She exclaimed to  herself.  She turned to Ranma, stopping  in front of him.</p><p>"Hey Ranma.   Wake up in there!"  Akane said  with a smile.</p><p>"Huh?  What  Akane?"  Ranma said, looking down, his  arms still behind his head.</p><p>"Give me a hug Ranma?"  Akane asked, smiling and spreading out her arms.</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened.  "W…what?"</p><p>"I said…give me a hug!" Akane said cheerfully.  Her charm was hard to resist.</p><p>"A hug?  You  gotta be kiddin'.  Why would I do that?"</p><p>"<i>Because</i> Ranma, we are fiancées aren't we?"</p><p>"Well yea…I guess.   But this is kinda sudden and all…"</p><p>"Well Ranma, do you want to do it or not?  I'm not going to ask you again."</p><p>"Well, I guess so, only because you're sick though."  Ranma said, approaching her.  Akane jumped into his arms.  Ranma put his arms around her, a bit  confused, but not asking any questions.   A few moments passed.  Akane  released Ranma.</p><p>"Ok, thanks Ranma!"   Akane said, turning around and walking back to the Dojo, as if nothing  had happened.</p><p>Ranma stood in the street, watching Akane  walking.  He scratched his head.  "This is just weird.  I hope she stays like that."  Ranma said, smiling to himself.  If Akane was sick, maybe he could stand to  be around her for a few more days.  He  walked behind Akane, trying to figure out what was going on in her mind.  He had no chance.</p><p>"Ok Akane…you have successfully scared Ranma."  Akane said to herself.  She took a deep breath.  "That fire had subsided again.  My chest feels so light.  It's like…clearness in my mind.  This is strange.  I wonder if this means something…" Akane continued to the Dojo,  more concerned about what was happening with her than worrying about what Ranma  thought.</p><p>Ranma and Akane entered the Dojo.  Akane was starting to feel more confident  about her feelings, like she had finally accepted them as hers.  Ranma was starting to worry about Akane even  more so after her hug.  They opened the  door.  Silence.  Akane went further inside the Dojo, looking  for anyone.</p><p>"Hey Pops.   You in here?"  Ranma asked  loudly.  No answer.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…look at this."  Akane said, picking up a note that lay on the dinner table.  Dinner was set out very eloquently, with two  candles burning brightly.  Ranma eyed  the candles, curious.</p><p>"Yea, what is it Akane?"</p><p>"It's a note from Nabiki."  Akane said, reading it.  A  few moments passed.</p><p>"She says that everyone will be gone until real late  tonight.  Our fathers are eating dinner  and going to the baths.  Kasumi is  shopping with Nabiki, then they will go see a movie."</p><p>"Hmm…that's kinda weird" Ranma said, taking the note  from Akane and reading it.</p><p>Akane glared at Ranma for snatching the note.</p><p>"Well Ranma, they will be back later on tonight, so  don't worry."</p><p>"You think I'm worried?  Ranma said with that smile of his.  "For once I can actually relax in here with everyone gone."</p><p>Akane looked up to Ranma confused.  "What was he talking about?"  She asked herself.  "Did Ranma actually want to be alone with me?"  A lump formed in Akane's throat.  She had given herself another thing to worry  about.</p><p>"Well, at least Kasumi finished dinner for us.  Let's eat."   Ranma said happily sitting down and grabbing his portion.  Akane followed suit, still trying to figure  out what was going on.</p><p>She sat across from Ranma, watching him eat.  He seemed to be in a good mood, despite what  she had done to him.</p><p>"Maybe Ranma felt the same way I did."  She said to herself, eating slowly.  That warm feeling returned.  It did not burn like before, but instead  felt more comforting than painful.</p><p>Akane set her chopsticks down, staring into her  plate.  What <i>if</i> Ranma had the  same feelings as her?  He did seem to  worry about her over the past 24 hours.</p><p>"Hey Akane?   Ranma asked.  "Is everything  OK?  You've been like this since  yesterday.  It's startin' to worry me."</p><p>Akane shook her head slightly, breaking her  trance.  Something arose from within  her, forcing it's way out of her mouth.</p><p>"No Ranma…everything is not OK."  Akane said, looking into Ranma's eyes.  He could see all the confusion, even a hint  of pain.  "Ever since last night…" Akane  broke off, fearing what she was about to say.</p><p>"What?"   Ranma asked</p><p>"Well…since then…"</p><p>Akane just couldn't say what was wrong.  She couldn't admit what her "sickness" was  about.  She just sat there.  Ranma examined her.  There was no way of getting the truth out of  her.  Ranma got a bit angry.</p><p>"Fine Akane."   Ranma said, a bit hurt.  "You can  be so Un-cute sometimes."</p><p>Ranma got up and switched on the TV.  The silence was killing him.  The channel had a bunch of music videos.</p><p>Akane remained seated at the table.</p><p>"That idiot Ranma!"   She said to herself.  "He has no  idea what I'm going through."  Akane  turned her gaze to the table, hurt.  She  sat there for a few minutes, thinking.</p><p>"Wait a second!   Nabiki said that she was going to help me.  But how?"  Akane continued  to think.  "She said I would find out at  dinner…" her eyes widened.  "Ranma and I  are alone for dinner.  That's what she  was planning.  She knew how I was feeling.  That's why even Kasumi left the house.  So that means…everyone knows…everyone wants  us to…" Akane let her thoughts trail off.   Everyone was in on it.  Even she  was kind of…curious, although she came to that conclusion reluctantly.  She still had no idea why these feelings had  manifested themselves, but they did and she would handle them.</p><p>Akane got up and sat next to Ranma.  She needed to say something to him, but she  didn't know how to go about it.</p><p>Ranma sat in front on the TV.  "Geeze…what's wrong with Akane now?"  He asked himself.  "She won't even tell me what's going on.  Does she even trust me?"</p><p>Ranma noticed that Akane had sat next to him.  He moved his eye discreetly to her  form.  She seemed to be fidgeting  nervously.  She wanted to say something  to him.  Ranma noticed a small glimmer  on her hand.  That engagement ring he  gave her.  She wore is proudly.  Ranma smiled to himself, remembering how he  felt about Akane.</p><p>"Maybe I should show her that I care about how she  feels."  Ranma noticed her hand.  It seemed to be calling out to him.  He reached his hand over, placing it on  hers.</p><p>Akane's heart jumped.  She had wanted that, but it still shocked her.  How did she find herself in this  position?  Maybe her body acted on it's  own again.  She really didn't care  though.  "Ranma <i>does</i> feel the  same way I do."  She said to herself.  "Could he really want to…?" Her heart began to beat faster.  She looked to Ranma.  Ranma turned to her, smiling.</p><p>Akane began to smile also.  She was starting to understand…about everything.</p><p>Akane made the first move.  She moved herself closer to Ranma.  Ranma seemed to have the same idea.  Akane pressed her lips against Ranma's passionately.  She brought her other hand around, placing  it behind Ranma's head.  Ranma placed his  free hand around Akane's back, giving her a kind of gentle hug.</p><p>The kiss ended after a few moments.  Ranma was still holding Akane's hand.  They looked at each other.  The both started blushing.  Embarrassed, Akane slid back to her side in  a shy manner.  Ranma resumed his TV  watching.</p><p>"Wow…" Akane said to herself.  "That really was me just then…everything was  on our side…so what am I waiting for?"   Akane looked at her hands.  "I do  feel better now, almost like I should…"</p><p>Akane sat there nervously planning her next  move.  She listened to the music video  that was playing</p><p><i>"You  may touch me in dreams, but they don't stay.</i></p><p><i>            Today  you don't have much to say</i></p><p><i>            How  am I gonna face the light of day?</i></p><p><i>            What  have I done now?"</i></p><p><i>            "Things  that we left unspoken, thinking it's for the best</i></p><p><i>            Then  I look into your eyes, gets tight in my chest…"</i></p><p>Akane sat there, thinking about what she was  hearing.  Her breathing began to get a  bit rapid.  That warmth seemed to cover  her whole body.  She was getting  nervous.</p><p>"What <i>have</i> I done now?"  Akane asked herself.  She took a deep breath.  "Ok Akane, no turning back now.  Everyone and everything is waiting for  you.  It would seem like everything is  pushing you to do this…"</p><p>Akane turned to Ranma; he was still a bit  embarrassed.  Akane moved closer to him;  she was sitting on her knees.</p><p>"Ra…Ranma?"   Akane asked. The nervousness was clear in her voice.</p><p>Ranma turned to her "Yea?"</p><p>"I um…well…I think we should…everyone knows that…"</p><p>Something was holding Akane back.  It was herself.  "Come on Akane" she tried.   She thought back to how much better she felt after Ranma's hug.  That was the only way to feel better.  Without giving it a second thought, Akane  grabbed Ranma, giving him another kiss.   She had to prove to herself that this was in fact her.</p><p>Ranma, stunned for just a second, soon found himself  lost in the moment.  Something felt off  about that kiss though…almost seemed to have been forced.  The kiss ended with Akane still sitting on  her knees, wrestling with her words.   Ranma took his hand, placing it on her forehead.</p><p>"Well…everything seems normal" Ranma said, seemingly  un-phased by the turn of events.   "Akane…this is really weird.  Who  are you?  And where is the real Akane?"</p><p>"What are you talking about Ranma?  This <i>is</i> the real me."  Akane said slowly; she had no idea what was  going on.</p><p>"No, you're not the real Akane.  The real Akane would have hit me for no  reason just then."</p><p>"But Ranma…can't you see that…I…" Akane tried her  best, but it wasn't enough.</p><p>"What?  See  what?  I see someone pretending to be  Akane if that's what you're talkin' about."</p><p>"No Ranma…" Akane continued with extreme  patience.  "Can't you see what's been  happening the past day or so?"</p><p>Ranma thought for a minute.  "Yea…you got that flu or somethin' right?"</p><p>"No<i>…Ranma</i>…" Akane's patience was starting to  wear thin.  "Haven't you been feeling  something…something you can't explain?"</p><p>"Uh…no.  What  are you talkin' about."</p><p>"You know…mysterious feelings that you have no idea  where they came from."</p><p>"Akane…I have no idea what you are talking  about.  Maybe you should go to sleep or  somethin'. That flu seems to have got a bit worse."</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane, very confused and shaking his  head.  Akane's patience had reached its  limit</p><p>"Damn it Ranma!   Don't play stupid with me.  I  know you know exactly what I'm talking about!"   Akane said, rising to her feet.</p><p>Ranma leaned back, absorbing the assault.  "What…what are you talking about Akane?"</p><p>"Ranma…you blockhead, I said stop playing your  stupid games!"</p><p>Ranma got to his feet.  "I ain't playin' no stupid games Akane.  If anyone is playin' games, its you, actin' all weird and stuff."</p><p>"No Ranma, I know you know.  So does everyone else.  Nabiki, Kasumi, our fathers, probably even a  few of your former fiancées."</p><p>"Akane, what the hell are you talkin' about?"</p><p>"You know perfectly well what I'm talking  about.  Its about our feelings for each  other!"</p><p>"Feelings for each other?  What kind of feelings?  I  know what feeling angry at each other is!"</p><p>"Oh Ranma… I am <i>way</i> passed angry.  You can be so damn dense sometimes.  You don't have to hide your feelings for me  any more."</p><p>"Who's hidin' their feelings!  I told you I loved you and that's that  right?  Geeze…that sickness has made you  so violent…"</p><p>"Sickness?   Ranma, wake up and open your eyes, it wasn't a sickness; it was my  feelings!"</p><p>"There you go with that feelings garbage again. What  are you talking about?"</p><p>Akane's anger reached its breaking point.</p><p>"<i>Damn it</i> Ranma!  Do I have to <i>spell </i>it out to you?  Are you so stupid that you can't pick up  what I'm saying?"</p><p>"You're the one that's actin' stupid!"</p><p>"Fine…you want stupid…I'll show you stupid!"  Akane reached behind her back and started  fiddling around back there.</p><p>"That Ranma is <i>such an idiot</i>…I'll show him  though.  I've been under too much  pressure to do this and he isn't gonna stop me."  Akane said to herself.</p><p>Ranma  looked on, curious and mad.  Akane then  lifted her dress off her body, throwing it violently behind her.</p><p>"There Ranma!   Can you understand <i>this</i> or do you need a diagram?"</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened in total shock.  Akane had <i>never</i> done that  before.  He took a step back, intrigued,  but fearing for his life.</p><p>"A…Akane…what are you doing?"</p><p>Akane seethed for a moment.  Ranma was stupid beyond all human  comprehension.  She stood there in her  underwear, clenching her fist.</p><p>"Still don't get it do you Ranma?"  Akane asked, approaching him.  Ranma was backed into a corner.  No escape.</p><p>Akane got next to Ranma.  He was starting to get worried.</p><p>"Ok Ranma…we both know we want this and everyone  else knows it too. I'm only gonna do this for you once so lets get this  done!"  Akane said, grabbing Ranma's  shirt and bringing him up to her.  Ranma  pushed back instinctively.  He had a lot  of practice with that maneuver.  He  pushed Akane back a few steps, totally baffled at what was happening.  Akane approached him again.  Ranma gritted his teeth.</p><p>Akane stopped abruptly in front of him.  Her rage vanished, her old self was  back.  She turned her eyes to the floor.</p><p>"What…what am I doing?" she asked audibly.  She looked down, noticing that she was in  her underwear.  She was stunned.  She looked up to Ranma, hoping for some sort  of explanation.  He was just as  confused.  Akane quickly tried her best  to hide her assets from Ranma, but it was too late.  Ranma approached her seriously.   He placed his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>"Akane…" he said in almost a whisper.</p><p>"What have I done?"   Akane asked herself, looking into Ranma's eyes.  He was the serious one this time.  "Oh man…I…I can't go through with it…" She  turned her head away from Ranma.</p><p>Ranma grabbed her head and looked into her eyes…</p><p>"Akane…"</p><p>"Shit!"   Akane said to herself.  What had  she got herself into now? There was no way out.  She just gazed into Ranma's eyes, hoping this nightmare would end  soon.</p><p>"…I had no idea it had progressed this far…we have  to do something…"</p><p>Akane's heart skipped a beat.  She took a deep breath.  "Well…at least everyone will be happy."  Akane thought to what would happen next.  She kind of looked forward to the next  couple of hours.  She might just enjoy  it…She relaxed her body.</p><p>"…We have to do something…about that flu," Ranma  said, seriously.</p><p>Akane just blinked at Ranma…utterly stunned.</p><p>"Hey…Akane?   Man…that flu is serious isn't it?"</p><p>"Ranma didn't have the same feelings about me as I  did about him.  Even he isn't that  dense.  Ranma…almost made me…" Akane  lashed out at Ranma.  She blamed him;  fully knowing it was her fault.  She  struck Ranma in the cheek, sending him back.</p><p>"What the hell did you do that for, you stupid  tomboy?"  Ranma demanded.</p><p>Akane looked at her clenched fist.  "Maybe this <i>was</i> a flu…maybe those  feelings weren't mine…"</p><p>"I'm sorry Ranma… I have no idea what's going on…"  Akane looked at Ranma.  He was getting  up.</p><p>"Well, where could you have got a flu from?"  Ranma asked, putting that incident behind  him</p><p>Akane shook her head.  "I dunno.  I don't even  know what is causing this…"</p><p>"Could it have been something you ate?"</p><p>"I don't think so.   I had all the same things you did.   Dinner yesterday and tonight.   Those cookies Kasumi baked for everyone…"</p><p>Ranma cut her off.   "What cookies?"</p><p>"You know…those chocolate chip cookies that Kasumi  made.  She put them in that heart shaped  cookie tin."</p><p>Ranma snapped his fingers.  He had figured it out.</p><p>"Ah ha!   Those cookies weren't from Kasumi…they were from Kodachi!"</p><p>"What?   Kodachi!  How do you know?"</p><p>"She wrote me one of those stupid letters.  I left it in the garbage.  They must have been laced."</p><p>"So that explains everything then…" Akane said, maybe  she was a bit disappointed.  "What do we  do now?"</p><p>"Well, there is one place I can go.  Shampoo knows a lot about that kinda  stuff.  I'm sure she can give you a cure  or somethin'"</p><p>Akane smiled, relived that she wasn't going  crazy.  "Thanks Ranma."  Akane said.   Ranma walked to the door.</p><p>"You better stay here Akane…no telling what you'll  take off next," Ranma said with a smile.   Akane looked down at herself.   There wasn't much left on her.   She blushed and ran to her fallen dress, throwing it on quickly.  Ranma walked out into the night, heading for  the Kat Café.  Akane needed to sit  down…she was completely lost.</p><p><u>The Truth</u></p><p>Ranma approached the Kat café.  The lights were off, except for the ones  upstairs.  Ranma knocked loudly on the  door.  The lights inside came on.  Shampoo opened the door.</p><p>"Oh, <i>Nihao</i> Ranma!"  She exclaimed, jumping into his arms.  Shampoo suddenly realized what she did.  She released Ranma; her head was hung low.  "Shampoo sorry Ranma…"</p><p>"Its ok Shampoo…hey…remember what you said yesterday…about  helping Akane?"</p><p>"Yes...Akane need help?"</p><p>"Yea…she ate some sort of laced cookies and has been  acting very strangely."</p><p>"Come in Ranma, great-Grandmother help for  sure."  Shampoo said, leading Ranma to  her</p><p>"Something wrong with Akane?"  Cologne asked.</p><p>"Yea…how did you know…" Ranma said, puzzled.</p><p>"I could tell from her performance during our  training session.  Something was  weighing heavily on her heart."</p><p>"Yea you can say that again."  Ranma said, sitting down.  "It's like this.  Two days ago, I got a strange package.  I opened it and found a heart shaped tin that had cookies  inside.  I thought I threw them away in  time, but Akane said she had some.  Then  she began sweating and shaking and stuff.   Today she seemed to lose those symptoms, but started acting all weird,  giving me hugs and kisses and spouting some stuff about our "feelings"."</p><p>Cologne nodded.   "I see…I suspected as much, but I wasn't sure."</p><p>"So you know what's wrong with her?"</p><p>"Yes Ranma.   Whoever sent you those cookies wanted you bad…and I don't mean to go out  on a date."</p><p>Ranma suddenly got a sick feeling in his stomach.</p><p>"There is an ancient recipe for "Chocolate chip  cookies of Lust" in our Amazon traditions.   We kept the secret locked up, for fear it would be used for non-healing  purposes.  Apparently, the person that  made the cookies had experience in that kind of art."</p><p>"So…what was it supposed ta' do?"  Ranma asked</p><p>"Well…basically, it takes deep rooted feelings and  forces them out.  Any normal person  would have succumbed to the powers of the cookies. I am not surprised that  Akane was able to resist her urges so.   She has a very strong will."</p><p>"Wait a second…you mean all yesterday…Akane was  trying to…"</p><p>"Yes, Ranma.   Those cookies forced feelings and visions into her mind, making it hard  to for her concentrate."  Cologne  trailed off for a second, thinking.</p><p>"Ranma…when exactly did she eat the cookies?"</p><p>Ranma thought for a moment.  "It was two days ago, it musta been right  after school.  That's when Kasumi told  me I had a package.  I opened the  cookies, but I knew better than to eat 'em.   Kasumi asked me to help her, so I left the cookies there.  Then Akane came a few minutes later…telling  me about a test we had.  After that, I  threw them away.  She musta ate 'em when  she came down stairs."</p><p>"That is very strange…" Cologne said thoughtfully.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"The Cookies of lust are only supposed to last for  24 hours, upon them entering the stomach."</p><p>"That means that she should have started to feel  better right about the time you and Shampoo showed up for the training  session."</p><p>"Yes…but she was very confused and uncertain…I could  see it…"</p><p>"Well, we shouldn't worry about it.  As long as there is a cure."</p><p>Cologne nodded.   "Shampoo.  Please fetch me my  green herbal bag.  I will make a tea to  neutralize the toxins used in the recipe."</p><p>"Thank you Cologne.   Things were starting to get heated in there…"</p><p>"Oh…how so?"   Cologne asked, interested in what would happen between the two.</p><p>"Well…I'd rather not get into that."  Ranma said, smiling shyly.  It would have been nice if he and Akane did  go through with it though…</p><p>Cologne prepared the tea carefully.  Shampoo watched her, gathering  knowledge.  She gave it to Ranma in a  small covered bowl.</p><p>"Tell Akane to drink this.  She will feel instantly better."</p><p>"OK, thanks a lot!"   Ranma said, heading out the door.   Shampoo followed him.</p><p>She stood at the door, watching Ranma run down the  street.  She felt a bit sad…but her fate  led elsewhere.</p><p>"Good Luck Ranma.   Shampoo happy to help you!"  She  yelled at Ranma.</p><p>Ranma's figure turned, all she could see was his  silhouette, waving his hand in the air and yelling something back.</p><p>Shampoo watched until his form vanished.  She turned back inside, sadly.</p><p>"Don't worry my granddaughter.  The fates were against us from the  beginning."  Cologne started.  "The best we can do is honor our ancestors  and wish them the best."</p><p>Shampoo turned to Cologne; a tear came out of her  eye.  She knelt down to her knees,  crying at her loss of Ranma.  It was for  certain now.  Cologne brought her small  form next to Shampoo, patting her on the back.   Fate was harsh like that sometimes.</p><p>Akane sat at the dining table, perplexed.</p><p>"So…it was because of those cookies after all.  There really were two sides fighting inside  me…" Akane sighed a bit.  "So…all those  feelings I had…weren't really mine to begin with.  I was so sure of my actions though…everything seemed to be  pushing me." Akane's chest had lightened, she could breathe normally now.  The first time for what seemed like  ages.  She smiled to herself.  "I should have known…I mean…me…wanting Ranma  like that.  You have got to be kidding.  But somehow…maybe it would have been kinda  nice…I mean…Ranma was a guy after all.   I guess he woulda liked it.   Well…one day for sure…"</p><p>The opening door disrupted any further thought.  Akane turned around, seeing Ranma carrying a  weird looking bowl.  "Hey Akane!"  Ranma called to her.  "Cologne and Shampoo got you a cure, she  said to drink this and you will feel instantly better."</p><p>Ranma smiled as he handed her the bowl.  Akane removed the lid and drank.  It tasted a bit like a warm green tea, but  with a hint of something else.  Akane  sat there for a few moments.  She didn't  feel any different.</p><p>"So Akane, feeling better?"  Ranma asked, smiling</p><p>"Uh…well yea…thanks Ranma."  Akane said, she was still a bit shy about  what she had almost done.</p><p>"You know…Cologne said that those were Cookies of  lust, or somethin' like that.  She told  me that the effects should have worn off after your little training session  today."</p><p>"Oh…really?"   Akane asked half-heartedly.</p><p>"Yea…kinda weird isn't it.  She said it was supposed ta' take hidden feelings and bring them  to the surface, but after that, they were supposed ta' stop…" Ranma said  thoughtfully.  "Wait a second Akane…you  were actin weird all night tonight.   Shouldn't those cookies have worn off by now…"</p><p>Akane thought for a moment.  She went back to the training session she  had today.  "Let's see…at school I was  all shaky and nervous, but that did start to wear off as soon as I got  home.  I could think clearly shortly  after.  I even began plotting to…" Akane  suddenly realized something.  Ranma  watched as she grew pale.  "Those  cookies <i>did</i> wear off…that <i>was</i> me back then, just the same as it  was tonight.  Those really <i>were</i>  my feelings.  I <i>did</i> want to…"  Akane's stomach got a bit weak, realizing the truth of the depth of her  feelings for Ranma.  Secretly, she knew,  but tried desperately to hide it from herself.   It was too much of a change from the Akane of a few months ago, what  with her hating boys so much.</p><p>"Hey Akane?   Why do you look so pale?"  Ranma  asked, concerned.  An idea popped into  his head.  "Say…if the cookies were  supposed to wear off by this after noon…. that means that it was really you  just now.  You made all the decisions  tonight by your self."</p><p>Akane's stomach got weaker.  Ranma wasn't as stupid as she previously  thought.  What was she going to do?</p><p>"Ranma…I'm sorry…it's just that…" Akane wanted to  apologize that it took her so long to realize her emotions; she wanted to  apologize for how slow things were going.   She couldn't get the words out…</p><p>Ranma started to laugh.  "Yea right…You…Akane…actually plotting to sleep with me?  If you were half as cute as that, I would  jog around town 100 times on my left hand."   Ranma continued his laughter; Akane narrowed her eyes at Ranma. "Ha…that  was a good one wasn't it?  You…plotting  like that so.  Well, I'm just glad  that…" Ranma's smile vanished; having noticed Akane wasn't taking it as  lightly.</p><p>"<i>Ranma you…stupid, perverted, cross-dressing,  moron</i>!"  Akane shouted at him.  Akane lashed out with her fist.  Ranma saw that one coming and dodged  it.  Akane started after him.  Ranma ran away, again fearing for his life.</p><p>"See…what did I tell you?"  Ranma said, turning and facing Akane.  "You are too violent to have done even one-tenth of what you did  today!"</p><p>Akane stopped dead in her tracks.  "Hmph…I don't have to listen to a pervert  like you.  I'm going to bed!"  Akane shouted, storming upstairs.  "Man…that Ranma is truly an idiot," she said  to herself, heading to her room.  She  started to fell a bit sad suddenly.   "Did Ranma actually mean what he said?"   Akane listened to his voice echo in her head.  "If you were half as cute as that…"</p><p>"I wonder what Ranma meant by that.  Maybe he did want to…whatever! I shouldn't  worry about it right now.  Besides, we  are still in high school.  That would  just complicate things more. I'll just wait."   Akane approached her door.  She  opened it and went inside.  Her mind did  a double take.  She went back to the  door.  Her little sign had been  altered.  It read  "Ranma and Akane" She rolled her eyes.  "Only our fathers could have done  that."  She looked inside her room.  Ranma's bedding was inside, neatly laid out  next to her bed.  "I'm surprised they  didn't just get us a bigger bed."  Akane  knelt down; rolling the sheets up and taking them back to where they  belonged.  She heard footsteps coming up  the stairs.  She peeked out of her  room.  Ranma was coming up.</p><p>He looked over to Akane, holding his bedding.  "Hey Akane?   What are you doing with my blankets there?"  Akane pointed to the altered sign.</p><p>"Our fathers are up to their old tricks again"</p><p>"Oh…" Ranma said.   "So you're so mad at me that you don't want anything to do with me?"</p><p>Akane turned to him.  "Well…no…I just thought that you wouldn't want to sleep in there  with me.  So I was just going to put it  back in your room.  You didn't actually  want to…"</p><p>Ranma regained his composure.  "Oh, of course not…well not unless you wanted  me too…"</p><p>"Well…it has nothing to do with what I want."  Akane began slowly.  "You see…this was kinda my fault.  I told Nabiki what was going on and she took  it too far.  That's why everyone left us  alone tonight.  She said she was going  to help me out…It would seem everyone wanted us to start…acting the part…Nabiki  was only trying to help."</p><p>"Yea…you know how everyone can be…."</p><p>Ranma and Akane looked at each other.  They both turned their eyes to the ground, a  bit embarrassed.  The silence was  deafening.  Maybe they both should start  acting the part.</p><p>"So…Akane…" Ranma tried</p><p>"W…what…" Akane returned slowly.  They stood there, silent for a few more  moments, searching for the right words to say.   They couldn't find them.</p><p>"Uh…well…I'm just gonna take a bath" Ranma said,  giving up his fight.</p><p>"Sure Ranma…I'll just…um…put this in your room  then."</p><p>"Ok…thanks Akane"</p><p>"Ok then Ranma…"</p><p>They looked at each other for a mew more moments.</p><p>"You know Akane…I…uh.  Well actually…"</p><p>"What Ranma?"   Akane asked, almost hopefully.</p><p>"Well…you know…if you wanted me to sleep in there…I  would understand.  I know it wouldn't be  because <i>you</i> wanted to.  It would  be just to get our fathers offa our back.   Of course we don't have to…its not like I actually wanted to or  anything, but whatever you decided would be fine with me."</p><p>"Well…if you don't want to…its not like we haven't  disobeyed our fathers before."</p><p>"Uh…well…if that's your choice then…not like I care  either way, I was just sayin' you know…"</p><p>"Yea…" Akane was a bit saddened, as was Ranma.</p><p>Ranma walked slowly to the bathroom while Akane went  and laid out his blankets for him in his room.</p><p>Time ticked away slowly.  Akane just sat in her room, trying to busy her mind to keep it  from reflecting on today's events.   Ranma returned to the TV after his bath.  Soon he went to bed.  No  one showed up at the Dojo until about 1 am.</p><p>Everyone entered, with cautious optimism.  Nabiki was the first up stairs.  She opened Akane's door slowly.  No Ranma.   Nothing had happened.  She shook  her head, disappointed.  Soun and Genma  looked at each other.  Ranma and Akane  were determined to move at their own pace, no matter what they plotted.  There was no rushing this.  Defeated, the family got ready for bed.  Kasumi stayed up to clean up a bit.  Tomorrow was another day.</p><p>*****Hey! I'm still alive! I know it's been a week.  Well, remember that story I was working on? I've prolly said this a hundred  times, but I found a publisher that publishes first time book authors. So, in  accordance with that, my entire amount of free time is spent there. And I just  got back from sending my chapter off to the contest. Heh. After an…I'd say 70%  rewrite that is. It's a lot better.  Well, that just leaves about 20 more chapters to do. And I have to  cut my story by about 70 pages. Ugh…</p><p>So, I'm doing that. It's harder than I thought. But  don't worry. I'm not gonna forget you guys. I still have two other fics to  post. So just bare with me, and I'll try hard to update on a more frequent  basis. Hope you liked this chapter! The next chapter is my personal favorite!  It's really cute! And it'll set up the the following 10 chapters.</p><p>Until next we meet!*****</p>
