</div><p>Chapter  Seventeen</p><p><u>Much Ado  About Jusenkyo</u></p><p>"This trip will be very difficult for  everyone."  Cologne started as she  entered the massive forest.  "I  purposely selected the airport furthest away from Jusenkyo, as to have the most  time to train.  This will not be a  pleasure trip.  I will expect nothing  but the most from everyone here.  Your  reward will be the Nannichaun…and brand new husbands."</p><p>Ranma smiled excitedly.  "Oh man…this is gonna be good…I can't wait until we begin our  training."</p><p>"Your training has already begun, Ranma" Cologne  said.  Ranma looked around.</p><p>"I don't see nothin'…" Cologne cut her off, tripping  her with her staff.</p><p>"Always be on your guard…" she said, hopping  away.  Akane stopped and helped Ranma  up.  Ukyo turned and watched the kind gesture.  She smiled.   What in the world made her think that she stood half a chance of getting  Ranma all to herself?  The wheels inside  her head started turning…she just had to help those two along in their  relationship…as an apology for everything. That would keep her mind from  wandering...</p><p>The group pressed onward.  Cologne was eyeing the map, written in Chinese.  Mousse was walking proudly next to  Shampoo.  Shampoo just ignored his  presence, talking with Akane and Ukyo.   Ranma approached Mousse.</p><p>"Hey Mousse…nice job back there.  I didn't think you could win…"</p><p>Mousse smiled to Ranma; the light in his glasses was  hiding his eyes.  "Well…I nearly didn't  win.  But now…I have my beloved  Shampoo."</p><p>"Hey…you didn't exactly beat her…more like you won  by default.  Do the laws still work in  that case?"</p><p>"The laws do when they say the loser must marry…"</p><p>Ranma nodded, fully understanding Mousse's plan.</p><p>"I have to admit though…I didn't plan on having  Shampoo leave like that.  I was  confident I could beat her."</p><p>Ranma eyed Mousse carefully.  "So…that wasn't your plan to make Shampoo  give up?"</p><p>"No Saotome.   I guess I just got lucky!"</p><p>"Oh well, at least <i>you</i> are happy…"</p><p>"Shampoo is too, just watch this."  Mousse said, turning to Shampoo.</p><p>"I love you Shampoo!"  He said happily</p><p>Shampoo turned around, her eyes were like ice.  "You shut up duck boy!  Maybe you get killed by bear out here…save  Shampoo the trouble…"</p><p>"But Shampoo…aren't you happier now?"</p><p>"Shampoo be happier boiled alive!"  She said, turning a shoulder of ice toward  Mousse.  He turned back to the red  haired girl and smiled</p><p>"See Saotome.   Two weeks ago, she would have just splashed me with water, or just hit  me.  Now she actually pays attention to  what I say.  Things are looking up!"</p><p>"Wow Mousse…" Ranma said simply.  Mousse had issues…but he was right about one  thing.  Shampoo had gained that missing  part of herself.  Maybe Mousse was on  the right track.</p><p>Cologne lead the group into an opening.</p><p>"Here…we will make camp for tonight."  She said, looking up to the sky.  It was beginning to become late after noon.</p><p>"Ukyo…would you be so kind as to fix dinner for  everyone?"  She asked, turning to  her.  Ukyo gave her trademark smile and  set her bag down, pulling out a collapsible Okonomiyaki grill.</p><p>"Son-in-law.   Would you fetch the fire wood?"</p><p>Ranma turned to Cologne, smiling.  "Yea…sure thing…"</p><p>"Of course I will, honorable grandmother."  Mousse said happily.  He quickly turned and headed out to get the  firewood.  Shampoo eyed her  great-grandmother fiercely.</p><p>"Great-grandmother.   Mousse is not Shampoo's fiancée!'' she demanded.  "Mousse and Shampoo will never get married!"</p><p>"What about our laws child?"  Cologne said, calmly.</p><p>Shampoo looked at Cologne.  She had a point.</p><p>"Well…Shampoo go through with it…but, Shampoo find  way to get rid of Mousse!"</p><p>Cologne just smiled.  Ranma was watching her handle the situation.  She seemed so confident.  Akane approached him, also noticing how Cologne  handled the situation.</p><p>"What do you think is going on with those two?"  Akane asked Ranma, setting down her pack</p><p>"I dunno…but I'll bet Cologne knows exactly what she  is doin'" Ranma replied.  "So…shall we  camp out tonight?"  She asked with a  smile, turning to Akane.</p><p>"Fine by me…but aren't you forgetting something?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Akane looked into Ranma's eyes.  She didn't have to turn her head upwards at  all, but was at eye level with her.</p><p>"Never mind…" Akane said, going through her bag.</p><p>"Oh yea…I almost forgot!"  Ranma finally said, smiling.   "Hey Ryoga…where's that kettle you always carry around?"</p><p>Ryoga reached in his bag and instantly pulled it  out.</p><p>"Thanks."   Ranma replied, waiting for Mousse to return with the firewood.</p><p><u>The  Training Begins</u></p><p>"<i>Hiya</i>!"   Akane screamed, launching her foot out towards Ranma.  Ranma leapt over the attack, flying into the  darkening sky.</p><p>"Now Akane!   Don't let your opponent get a chance to breathe.  Once you have the offensive, do <i>not</i>  let it go.''  Cologne said, coaching the  match.</p><p>Akane charged to Ranma, who had landed by now.  She threw a volley of rights and lefts to  Ranma.  Ranma was still able to read her  moves, dodging every one of them.</p><p>"Come on…Akane…You can do…better…than this…" Ranma  said, in between punches.</p><p>Akane ignored Ranma's words, spinning around with a  massive roundhouse.  Ranma ducked the  kick, watching Akane bring her other foot around in a front kick.  Ranma stuck up his forearm, blocking the  powerful kick.  The force sent him back  a little.</p><p>"Yo Akane…chill out…this is just a practice match…"  Ranma said, noticing that Akane was going all out.  Ranma suddenly felt his arm start aching.  That blow almost broke his arm, leaving a  large bruise where her foot had landed.</p><p>"Sorry Ranma…I still kinda get worked up  sometimes."  Akane said  apologetically.  She wiped her forehead,  calming herself down.  It was then she  noticed Ranma was favoring his right arm.</p><p>"Oh…did I do <i>that</i>?"  She asked; astonished she at the mark she had left.</p><p>Ranma smiled.   "Oh…that's just a little bruise…it's nothin'" he replied.</p><p>"Really…then why are you holding it?"</p><p>"Well…maybe it hurt just a little bit…"</p><p>"Ranma you…come here.  Hold still."  Akane said,  pulling out a strange smelling cream from her bag and grabbing Ranma's arm.</p><p>Ranma sat next to her on a tree stump.  Akane was carefully working the cream into  Ranma's sore arm.</p><p>"It's a cream that Tofu-sensei gave me a while  back.  I thought I would be useful out  here…"</p><p>"Thanks Akane.''   Ranma said, smiling a bit.</p><p>"There…all better!"   Akane replied, smiling cutely.   "Sorry about that Ranma.  I guess  I did over do it."</p><p>"Hey…no problem.   I guess you really should train as hard as you can up here.  You got a long way to go if you wanna match  me."</p><p>"Not as long as you would think Ranma…" Akane said,  getting her and Ranma some of the finished dinner.  She looked around.  Mousse  was happily eating next to Shampoo.   Shampoo ignored him.  Ukyo was  smiling happily from the makeshift grill site.   Ryoga was just putting up his tent for the night.</p><p>"Maybe we should put up ours…" Ranma said  thoughtfully.</p><p>"Nah…I wanted to sleep under the stars tonight.  It's so warm out here."  Akane replied.  Ranma nodded, finishing his dinner.  Everyone got ready to take a good break.  They had been walking all day.  Ranma and Akane lay under the stars, happily  watching the night go by.  Cologne and  Shampoo were inside their tent, with Mousse sleeping outside next to it.  Ukyo too slept outside.  Ryoga decided it was better to be in his  tent…incase of sudden showers.</p><p>Morning came and Ukyo fixed breakfast.  Soon the campsite was packed up and ready to  go. Ranma turned to Akane; she seemed to be struggling with her pack.</p><p>"Here…" Ranma said, holding out his hand.  "I'll carry that for you.  I guess I kinda owe ya one for helpin' my  arm last night."</p><p>Akane nodded happily.  Mousse eyed this exchange carefully.</p><p>"My beloved Shampoo.  I shall carry your…" Mousse attempted.  Shampoo just threw the bags at him.</p><p>"Good.  For  once you make yourself useful."  Shampoo  said, walking past him.</p><p>Ryoga and Ukyo looked at each other, seeing all the  other couples.</p><p>"Don't expect me to carry your bags for you  Ukyo."  Ryoga said, starting off.</p><p>"I don't need any help with my gear, sugar."  Ukyo smiled back slyly.  She collapsed her grill and started off.</p><p>Akane watched that little episode.  Her mind started to wander.  She stealthily approached Ranma, nudging him  to where they could talk without being heard.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…look at those two."  Akane whispered, remembering how Ukyo had  tried to "help" her a few days ago.   Payback time.</p><p>"Huh?   What?"  Ranma said in his normal  tone.  Akane shushed him</p><p>"Sorry…what is it Akane?"  He returned in a whisper.</p><p>"Look at those two…" Akane said, indicating ahead of  her.  Ranma looked, puzzled.</p><p>Mousse was following Shampoo happily.  Shampoo was just ignoring him.</p><p>"So…those two are always like that..."</p><p>"No, not those two.   Ryoga and Ukyo.  What do you  think?"</p><p>Ranma eyed the pair, walking next to each  other.  They were concentrating more on  where they were going than whom was next to them.</p><p>"What do you think about what?"  Ranma asked, perplexed.</p><p>"<i>Those</i> <i>two</i> Ranma…wouldn't they make a  good couple?"</p><p>Ranma scoffed.   "Yea… that would happen.  I think  Uc-Chan has higher standards than that.   Besides…Ryoga would never find his way to Uc-Chan's little store to ask  her out."</p><p>"Oh…come on Ranma.   We started out like that…not noticing what the other was feeling."</p><p>"No…we started out with an attempted murder  remember?  <i>Then</i> we didn't talk to  each other….<i> Then</i> we moved up to wondering what each other was thinkin'"</p><p>Akane blushed a bit, remembering those days so long  ago.</p><p>"Besides…I don't think those two have any feelins'  for each other."</p><p>"I don't know Ranma…maybe they just need help  bringing them out…"</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened.  "Oh no you don't Akane.   Yea…maybe you helped Mousse and Shampoo, but we need to stay outta stuff  like this."</p><p>Akane smiled.   "Well no one said <i>you</i> have to help.  I'm going to talk to Ukyo about it.  Maybe she does have feelings for Ryoga…they did get along during  that trip on the plane."</p><p>"Yea…that was 'cuz Ryoga was asleep the whole time  and you just kept talkin' to Uc-Chan"</p><p>"Whatever Ranma.   I'm gonna find out right now!"   Akane said, rushing over to Ukyo and pulling her to the back of the  makeshift formation</p><p>Akane smiled broadly at Ukyo.  That smile made Ukyo uneasy.</p><p>"Hey…Ukyo…I was wondering…" she started, wearing  that smile of hers</p><p>"Yea…what about?"   Ukyo replied slowly.</p><p>"How do you feel about Ryoga?" Akane asked quickly.</p><p>Ukyo looked over to Ryoga, seeming to be in his own  little world.</p><p>She shrugged.   "He's alright I guess…got no directional sense though and he's a bit on  the stupid side.  But I don't have  anything against him."</p><p>"So…that means you like him then?"</p><p>"Well…like I said…he's ok in my book…"</p><p>"Just…OK?"</p><p>"Yea…wait a second.   What are you trying to pull here Akane?"  Ukyo said, knowing where this conversation was going.</p><p>"Oh…nothing…" Akane said playfully</p><p>"You!  You're  trying to hook me and Ryoga up aren't you?"   Ukyo demanded.  She wasn't  amused.</p><p>"Well…come on Ukyo.   You have to admit that under that tough exterior…there is a soft, gentle  side of Ryoga.  That was the part I saw  in P-Chan.  Maybe you should just get to  know him a bit more."</p><p>Ukyo shook her head.  "Nah…I'll pass."</p><p>"Oh…be a sport Ukyo.  Ryoga seems awfully lonely over there.  He could use a good friend like you to cheer him up."</p><p>"Then why don't <i>you</i> go cheer him up?"  Ukyo said as a matter of factly.</p><p>"Well…for one I'm not the one that is interested in  him…"</p><p>"What!  You  think I'm actually interested in a guy like that?"  Ukyo said in a loud whisper.</p><p>"You mean…you're not…" Akane returned, disappointed.</p><p>"No…not that way anyway.  Yea, he's a good fighter but I never pictured us going out or  anything."</p><p>"Well…just go over there and say hello to him or  something. Like I said, he always seems to be depressed."</p><p>"I…guess I could at least talk with him…but only for  you Akane."  Ukyo said, approaching  Ryoga.  She walked along side of him for  a few moments, watching Akane return to Ranma and start whispering to him</p><p>"Oh…that's how it is huh Akane?"  Ukyo smiled to herself.  "Well…two can play hook up…"</p><p><u>Ukyo's  Plan</u></p><p>Everyone paused for a second, looking around.  This would be the perfect place to set up  camp tonight.  Everyone assembled their  tents and such, eagerly looking forward to another wonderful dinner.  Ukyo looked over to Ranma and Akane, sitting  next to each other.  Akane's little plan  didn't work.  Ryoga was preoccupied with  something earlier that day, making any reasonable attempt at conversation a bit  difficult.  She had been thinking on the  subject of Ranma and Akane for a while now, determined that she would help them  further their relationship.</p><p>"I wonder…" she thought to herself, preparing her  grill.  She looked around.  Ranma was leaving to go get the  firewood.  Akane was just sitting there;  she was gathering a small bucket of stuff and had a towel.</p><p>"Hey Akane…where you heading to?"  She asked,</p><p>"Oh…I figure I would go freshen up a bit after that  long walk.  It was a bit warm today  don't you think?"</p><p>"Yea it was pretty warm, even in this shaded  forest.  Well, hurry back now sugar,  dinner will be ready by the time you return."</p><p>With that, Akane walked off towards a small crystal  clear lake that Shampoo had pointed out.   She said the water was warm and sparkling…</p><p>After a few moments, Ranma returned, carrying a  large stack of firewood.  He set them  down in front of Ukyo, smiling.</p><p>"Is that enough Uc-Chan?"  He asked.</p><p>"Yea Ran-Chan.   Thanks for doing that for me."</p><p>Ranma started back to his seat.  Akane wasn't there.  He looked around a bit, not finding her.</p><p>"Hey Uc-Chan?   Where did Akane go?"  He asked.</p><p>"Oh…she went to…" Ukyo trailed off her words; a  light bulb flashed in her head.  She  paused a few moments.  Akane was taking  a bath…if her and Ranma were to meet up while Akane was bathing…not even Ranma  could mess <i>that</i> up.</p><p>"Hey…Uc-Chan?   Somethin' wrong?"</p><p>"Huh?  Oh!''  Ukyo said, coming out of her trance.  It  was the perfect plan.  "No…nothing is  wrong Ran-Chan.  Uh…Akane said she had a  surprise for you.  She walked off that  way without saying much…" Ukyo pointed to where that lake was; her smile made  Ranma a bit suspicious.</p><p>Ranma paused for a few seconds.  Ukyo was up to something.  She had that look in her eye…</p><p>Ranma shrugged.   "Whatever Uc-Chan.  I'm gonna go get  Akane.  Looks like dinner is almost  ready."</p><p>"Yea Ran-Chan…you do that…" Ukyo said, grinning form  ear to ear.  Ranma just walked off to  where Ukyo pointed, not wanting to argue.</p><p>A few minutes passed.  Ryoga approached Ukyo "What's taking Ranma and Akane so long?" he  asked her.</p><p>"Well…they are busy right now…with any luck.  I would give them about an hour or so at the  most…" Ukyo said with that big grin.</p><p>Ryoga just grabbed his plate and sat down  somewhere.  Ukyo sure was acting  strange…</p><p>Ranma followed a little trail for a few minutes,  coming across a small lake in the middle of a clearing.  Curious, he looked around.</p><p>"I wonder if I can trust Uc-Chan," he said to  himself, spying a figure standing on the side of the lake.  It was Akane.  She was looking around a bit, almost as if she was expecting  someone.  Ranma ducked behind a tree,  not making a sound.  He peeked his head  out.  Akane was starting to undress,  folding her pants and shirt and neatly setting them down while still in her  underwear.</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened.  "Wh…what is Akane doing?   Was Uc-Chan right about her surprise…nah…this can't be it.  Somethin' else must be going on."</p><p>Ranma watched as Akane turned her back, reaching for  her bra, undoing it and throwing it on that pile of clothes.  Ranma's heart skipped a beat.  Quickly he turned back around, before he  could see Akane finish undressing.</p><p>Ranma's breathing got faster as his heart beat  rapidly. "Oh man…Akane is serious.  She  is waitin' for me to show up…that means she wants to…"  Ranma promptly hit his head.  "Nah…Akane would never do something like  this…would she?"</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath.  His palms were starting to sweat and his hands were getting  shaky.  He forced his head back from  behind that tree, seeing Akane facing toward him in the water.  Their eyes met, but only for a second.  Stricken, Ranma turned back around; his  heart felt like it was going to leap out of his chest.</p><p>Akane looked toward that tree curiously.  That looked like Ranma, but he would know  better than to spy on her while she was taking a bath.  Akane caught another brief glimpse from that  tree.  Was that Ranma or some other  person?</p><p>"Ranma…is that you?"  Akane asked, puzzled.</p><p>"Oh man!"   Ranma said to himself, hearing Akane call his name.  She was serious, but…they shouldn't do that  kind of thing while training.  It looked  like Akane was just waiting in that water for something to happen…</p><p>"Ranma…are you here?"  Akane asked again.  Ranma  decided it was time to show himself.  He  just had to figure out what was going on.</p><p>He emerged from behind the tree with his eyes  planted firmly into the ground.</p><p>Akane screamed, throwing her arms around her chest.  "Ranma!  That <i>was</i> you!"</p><p>"Hey Akane…I don't think this is such a good  idea.  I mean…we're trainin' now and we  really don't need distractions."  Ranma  started.</p><p>Akane eyed Ranma for a few moments…he was awfully  serious about something.  "Ranma…what  are you talking about?"  She asked,  concerned.</p><p>Ranma looked up from the ground towards Akane.  She was just as confused as he was.  "I'm talkin' about your…"</p><p>Akane screamed.   "Ranma you <i>pervert</i>!  How  dare you follow me while I'm taking a bath!"</p><p>"B-bath?   But…what about your…"</p><p>"<i>Ranma</i>!   Turn around!"  Akane  demanded.  Ranma whirled, knowing that  he had angered Akane yet again.</p><p>"Oh man…this is gonna be bad…" Ranma thought to  himself.  He looked up, seeing Akane  standing in front of him angrily wearing that large towel.</p><p>"W-wait a sec Akane…I can explain."</p><p>"No Ranma…no need to explain now.  I caught you in the act!  We may be getting married soon but that  gives you no right to spy on my while I'm taking a bath!"</p><p>"Spy?  Wait a  second Akane.  You were the one that  left before dinner.  What about that  little "surprise" you had for me?"</p><p>"What surprise?"   Akane shot back.</p><p>"You know…you told Uc-Chan that you had a surprise  for me and then you just walked off."</p><p>"What kind of surprise?"  Akane asked, figuring out what was going on.</p><p>"Well…I saw you there…and you were looking  around.  Then you started undressing…I  figured you…you know, expected company or somethin'"</p><p>"So…you weren't spying on me?"  Akane asked.</p><p>"No…why on earth would I do that?"</p><p>Akane smiled.   "Sorry for yelling at you Ranma.   I think I know what's going on here."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I think Ukyo is starting to plot again…"</p><p>"What'cha talkin' about Akane?"</p><p>"Nothing…just don't worry about it."</p><p>"Well…so much for that surprise.  Don't' worry.  I couldn't bring myself to watch you change back there."  Ranma started off to the camp leaving Akane  time to finish her bath.</p><p>Akane returned to the camp.  Ukyo had a satisfied look on her face.  Akane sat down next to her, starting her  dinner.</p><p>"You two have fun?"   Ukyo asked, smiling to her.</p><p>"We had a blast!"   Akane said happily.  Ukyo  examined her.  She snapped her fingers.</p><p>"Dang…didn't work did it?"</p><p>"Nope…sure didn't.   Better luck next time Ukyo." Akane said, with her smile</p><p>"Well…maybe next time…" Ukyo started.  Akane cut off her thinking out loud.</p><p>"Hey Ukyo…I appreciate the help, but I don't think  either one of us is ready for that kind of commitment."</p><p>"Really?"   Ukyo looked disappointed.  "But I  thought that if I helped you two like that, it would…be the perfect way of  apologizing."</p><p>"Hey…don't worry about it Ukyo.  We have already accepted your apology,  remember?"</p><p>"Yea…I know…But…" Ukyo's once happy face started to  take a sad tone.  A tear made it's way  out of her eye.  She had started to  think of how she loved Ranma and just wanted him happy.  She promised herself she wouldn't do  that.  She soon gave up her fight.</p><p>"Ukyo?  What's  wrong?"  Akane asked.  This went a lot deeper than her just trying  to help out.</p><p>"I…I'm sorry Akane!"  Ukyo said, sobbing on Akane's shoulder.</p><p>Cologne looked at what was going on.  She turned to Mousse and Shampoo.  She just hopped off.  Mousse and Shampoo followed suit.</p><p>Ranma was also watching this.  He hit Ryoga on the shoulder.  "Hey…let's go have that match now."  He said.   Ryoga, unaware of what was happening, looked around.  He saw Ukyo's shape and decided to follow  Ranma.</p><p>"Ukyo…" Akane said, at a loss for words.  She looked around.  It was safe to talk.   Akane figured out why Ukyo tried so hard to get Ranma and Akane together  and why she was crying like this so.</p><p>"Ukyo…you still love him don't you?"  Akane asked sadly</p><p>Ukyo managed a weak nod through her tears.  "I know…I was stupid to let myself fall in  love with an engaged man…but…he seemed to care about me so much. I couldn't  help it."</p><p>"Ukyo…I'm sorry."   Ukyo looked up to Akane.  She was  also starting to cry.  Seeing her best  friend hurt so took its toll on Akane.</p><p>"No Akane…I was the stupid one.  I even tried on purpose to make you two  argue…I…I thought if I got you two together…that it would be a suitable  apology.  I almost ruined your relationship,  so I thought if I helped rebuild it…"</p><p>"Ukyo…it's ok now…" Akane tried.</p><p>"I knew I shouldn't have come along on this stupid  trip!" Ukyo asserted  "I <i>knew </i>this  was gonna happen…"</p><p>She got up,  frustrated that she let herself lose control of her emotions like that.  She knew it was risky with Ranma and Akane  here, but she just couldn't fully let go of Ranma.  She had to see him one last time before they got married.  She just walked into the darkness.  Akane watched her sadly.  She did not follow.</p><p>About an hour passed.  Everyone returned.  Akane  explained that Ukyo needed time to think things out.  They would wait until she came back.</p><p><u>Inside the  Tent</u></p><p>A rain shower had built itself through the night,  dropping its revitalizing water on the surrounding plants.  Everyone was forced inside their tents for  the night.  Ukyo still had not returned.</p><p>Ryoga awoke, hearing the gentle sounds of the rain  against his tent.  He looked outside,  hearing something else.  Everyone else  was asleep.  He looked toward where the  fire was.  Ukyo was sitting on a log next  to it, sobbing all by herself.  It  looked like she was soaking wet, but she didn't' seem to care.  She may catch a cold.</p><p>"Ukyo…what are you doing out there in the  rain?"  Ryoga asked.  Ukyo did not respond.</p><p>"Ukyo…you need to get out of that rain."</p><p>"I…I didn't bring a tent…I can't stay with Ranma and  Akane…Mousse and Shampoo were…"</p><p>"Come on Ukyo…I'll make room for you…unless…you want  to be by yourself right now."</p><p>Ukyo looked at Ryoga, making that kind gesture.  She really didn't want to be alone right  then.  She entered Ryoga's tent  silently.</p><p>"Are you…ok Ukyo?"   Ryoga tried. He was more used to listening than talking.</p><p>Ukyo did not respond.  She sat in his tent, a bit embarrassed.  She had her arms around her body for warmth.</p><p>"It's about Ranma isn't it?"  He asked.   Ukyo said nothing.</p><p>"Ukyo…sometimes we just have to get over things…"</p><p>Ukyo interrupted Ryoga's friendly attempt  "What do you mean, "just get over  things!"  It's not that easy!"  Ukyo said</p><p>Ryoga took a deep breath.</p><p>"Ukyo…just to let you know.  I know exactly how you feel right now."  He started.   Ukyo looked in his eyes.  He was  trying to hide the hurt in them.  Ryoga <i>did</i>  love Akane…</p><p>He clenched his fist.  "Akane…I loved her, but I could never tell her how I felt.  I tried many things to get her and Ranma to  break up, but it was no use.  They loved  each other too much.  On the day of  their duel…I decided to give up on Akane.   But she would never leave my heart.   If Akane was happy…no matter who she was with, I decided I would be happy  for her too.  Sometimes all we can do is  let go…but I couldn't do that.  I just  had to follow Akane up here to Jusenkyo.   I couldn't stand the fact of missing an opportunity to see her  again.  I loved Akane…but I would never  have it returned.  I know what you're  going through Ukyo…"</p><p>Ukyo looked up to Ryoga.  A tear came down his face, even though he tried with all his  strength to keep it inside.  She had  never seen this side of him…that soft gentle side that Akane said.  It made her feel comfortable.  More tears came out of Ukyo's eyes.  It was nice to have someone that could  understand what she was going through.</p><p>"But…but Ryoga…it's not fair!"  Ukyo said, jumping into his arms.  "I loved Ranma…but…it was so cruel…I was so  stupid to fall for that guy.  It was  like I was cursed, never able to hear those words from him, even though I told  him how I felt."</p><p>Ryoga examined Ukyo, letting all of her guard  down.  He had been in this situation  before…but this time he could do more than just be held.  He placed his arm around Ukyo, comforting  her.  "Fate can be cruel like that  Ukyo.  The best thing was can do is wish  those two a happy marriage."</p><p>"It…It's just…not fair…" Ukyo said weakly,  sobbing.  Ryoga looked at what was left  of Ukyo, crying in his arms.  She really  was a female deep inside…Ryoga just sat there, listening like he always did  with Akane.  Ukyo was a lot like  Akane…sweet and loving…</p><p>Morning came.   Ukyo's eyes opened.  She was  holding someone, a person lying next to her. It was Ryoga…She mover her eyes  around, seeing if anyone noticed.</p><p>"Man…I told myself I wouldn't let my guard down like  that.  Now what's gonna happen?"</p><p>"U-Ukyo?"   Ryoga asked.  He suddenly  remembered last night, where Ukyo cried herself to sleep</p><p>Ukyo looked at Ryoga.  He sat there in the tent, embarrassed.  Ukyo was blushing too. Sometimes in life there are no words…</p><p>"Well…I uh… better get outta here.  If anyone saw me in here, who knows what  they would think.'</p><p>Ryoga nodded.   Ukyo peeked her head out, almost bumping into a smiling Akane.</p><p>"Hey, you two sleep well?"  She asked, looking inside.   Ryoga and Ukyo were blushing heavily.</p><p>"Well…Shampoo fixed breakfast, whenever you two are  done in here."  She said teasingly.  Ukyo ran out, embarrassed.  Ryoga slowly made is way out, sitting by  himself and eating.</p><p>Neither of the two seemed to bring up what had  happened.  The camp was packed and  everyone started off.  Each person had  different goals in mind.  Whether it is  a cure for a curse or the hopes of a fiancée, or even closure…to a story in the  book of someone's life; in a chapter that was never meant to be written.</p><p>*****Heh. Well, here's chapter seventeen. Classis  set up. Next chapter, they arrive and that's where all the fun begins! Well if you  like action and fighting and martial arts and stuff it will be fun. If you like  that sappy romance stuff I'm prone to writing, you should also have fun.  Anyway, nothing much to report on. Except see ya next chapter!*****</p>
