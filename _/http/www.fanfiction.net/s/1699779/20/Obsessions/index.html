</div><p>Chapter  Twenty</p><p><u>Ranma Vs  Akane</u></p><p>"Ok Akane…this is it!  You want a real fight? You've got it!"  Ranma shouted to her.</p><p>Akane eyed over this red haired person.  She could sense her battle spirit.  She smiled.   Nothing was going to be held back.</p><p>Akane dashed towards Ranma's position.  Ranma narrowed her eyes.  To get Akane, she had to fight for  real…hopefully…she would weaken enough for her plan to work.</p><p>Ranma moved her head slightly, avoiding the  punch.  Akane tried a left.  Ranma parried the left with her forearm,  launching her own punch.  Akane grabbed  it, twisting it around.  Ranma fell to  the ground, performing a cartwheel like maneuver, spinning out of Akane's grasp  and landing a few feet away.  Akane ran  up to her.</p><p>Ranma ducked her attempted punch.  She spun around on her foot, trying to trip  Akane.  Akane jumped over the foot,  coming down with a kick.  Ranma back  flipped away.  She looked at Akane,  running towards her.  She was too  fast.  Akane connected with Ranma's jaw,  sending her back.  Ranma launched her  own punch, more or a defensive one than offensive.  Akane stuck up her forearm, blocking the blow.  Ranma punched again, getting the same  results.  That gave her time to regain  her focus, launching a roundhouse to Akane.   Akane ducked the kick, rising with her famous uppercut towards  Ranma.  Ranma was prepared.</p><p>She placed her hands on Akane's fists, rising into  the air.  Akane looked up to the air,  expecting Ranma to come down with a flying kick.  Suddenly, she spun around, seeing that Ranma had landed behind  her completely silently.</p><p>"Forgive me Akane."   Ranma said to herself, launching a kick to Akane.  It caught her firmly in the stomach, sending  her flying backwards.</p><p>Ranma watched as Akane landed on her back.  That was so hard for Ranma to do…but she had  to weaken Akane, and that was the only way.</p><p>Akane flipped up, seemingly not fazed in the  slightest.  She just smiled at  Ranma.  "Think that was gonna end  this?"</p><p>"No…I just had to send you a message.  I'm serious about this."</p><p>"No you aren't Ranma, I know you too well.  You still held back, even during that  kick."</p><p>Ranma was taken aback.  She realized that she <i>had</i> held back, even though she put  all she had in that blow.  Ranma's love  of Akane would not allow her to take this fight seriously.  Just then, Ranma noticed that thunderstorm  had stopped.  She looked around, seeing  the sun shining brightly through the clouds.   It was making the air very humid and hot…</p><p>Suddenly Akane took off, landing a powerful blow to  Ranma's stomach.  She had caught her off  guard.</p><p>Ranma slid backwards in the wet dirt on one knee,  holding her stomach.  Akane charged  again with a kick.  Ranma leapt over it,  expecting Akane to try her double kick move again.  Instead she found herself staring at a blue ball of fire  streaming up to her.</p><p>Desperately Ranma flipped in mid air, the fireball  grazing Ranma's shirt, scorching it a bit.   Ranma landed, much to Akane's delight.   She jumped in with a kick before Ranma could get over the shock.  She struck her in the jaw, cutting Ranma's  chin and sending a few drops of blood flying.   Akane then used a roundhouse to send Ranma flying backwards.</p><p>Ranma landed hard, almost landing in a near by  spring.  In fact, Ranma's hand had  landed inside the spring; the cold spring water was a sharp contrast to the hot  air.</p><p>Akane walked up to Ranma slowly, enjoying having the  upper hand.</p><p>All Ranma could do was stare at Akane.  "Geeze…this is unbelievable.  Akane's cursed form grants her perfection of  her skills."  Ranma said, remembering  the attack she executed with ease.   Ranma looked to the sky just briefly.   The sun was heating things up a lot…</p><p>Ranma's mind clicked.  "The air here has to be pretty hot…and this spring water is very  cold…"</p><p>"Had enough Ranma?"   Akane asked.  Ranma sprang up.</p><p>"No Akane…this is only the beginning!"</p><p>Akane took the offensive again.</p><p>"Ok Ranma…you may not like what she turns into, but  anything has to be better than being possessed by an Oni" Ranma said to  herself, back flipping over the spring.</p><p>"<i>Bachiatari Hiryuu Shoten Ha</i>!"  (Cursed Dragon's Heaven's blast")</p><p>Akane, stunned, watched as Ranma used the warm air  from the sun and the cold air coming off the spring water to generate a  spiraling torrent of cursed water that was coming right for her.</p><p>Quickly, Akane rolled out the way, watching the  tornado disintegrate, spilling on the sand.</p><p>"Nice try Ranma!"   She said, going on the attack again.</p><p>Ranma went to another spring.  "Try this one!"  She shouted, making another twister form.  Akane easily avoided it.</p><p>"Man…There are a lot of springs here and Ranma is  bound to get lucky with one of them…if I get hit by that water…who knows what I  would change to."  Akane thought to  herself, staring at Ranma.  "No!  I will not change, not until Ranma has been  dealt with.  All I have to do is get him  to use it one more time…"</p><p>Akane smiled, sending a flying kick to Ranma.  Ranma sidestepped the attack.  Akane whirled around with her foot.  Ranma flipped backward, landing across from  another spring.  Akane had done it.  She watched as Ranma punched down to the  sand next to the water.</p><p>Suddenly, Akane countered with her own fist, sending  the torrent of water back to Ranma.   Ranma rolled, avoiding it.</p><p>"<i>Shit</i>!"   She cursed out loud.  She had  forgot about Akane's reversal move.</p><p>"Forget about something Ranma?"  Akane asked, mockingly.</p><p>"Yea…I forgot how jealous you always were."  Ranma shot back.  She had to stall to think of another plan.</p><p>"Jealousy?   This has nothing to do with being jealous.  This is about all the times you've hurt me…times I can't forget."</p><p>Ranma rolled her eyes.  "So…revenge is it?  Is  that it?  Just revenge?  I expected better outta you Akane.  I would never think the person that forgave  everyone so fast would stoop to simple revenge."</p><p>"Ranma you idiot!   This is a lot deeper than that!"   Akane fired back.</p><p>"No it's not…I hurt you so you're gonna hurt  me…that's what it boils down to." Ranma said calmly.</p><p>Akane had enough.   She rushed over to Ranma.  Ranma  took a deep breath.  She had to bring  herself to fight back.  It wasn't the  first time she had fought women…so why was this so hard?</p><p>Ranma and Akane traded blows while everyone watched.</p><p>Ukyo looked on, astonished at all she had seen.</p><p>"You think Ran-Chan can really win this?"  She asked Shampoo.</p><p>"Shampoo don't know.  Shampoo fought Akane once before…Akane very tough fighter.  Ranma has work cut out for her."  She said.</p><p>"Well…there must be something we can do…" Ukyo said,  rising.</p><p>"Ukyo can't fight!   Arm is hurt bad."</p><p>"Well I can't just sit here and watch Ran-Chan get  brutalized by some stupid 300 year old curse!" Ukyo replied, running off to the  field of battle.</p><p>"No Ukyo.   Shampoo go.  You stay here. You  take care of everyone.  Shampoo able to  fight better than you."</p><p>Mousse protested loudly at Shampoo's words.  Shampoo knelt down to him.</p><p>"Mousse no want Shampoo to fight?"</p><p>The little white duck nodded.</p><p>"Shampoo sorry Mousse."  She said, sadly</p><p>Mousse looked on confused.  Shampoo ran off to join Ranma.   Ukyo forced herself to stay put.   A lot of good she would do without an arm and her spatula, besides she  had to stay to keep Mousse from running off …</p><p>"On second thought…maybe I could help things  out."  She said to herself.  She went to her pack, pulling out her  collapsible Okonomiyaki grill and a small bowl.  She went to a near by puddle, scooping out some of the  water.  Now all she needed was firewood.</p><p>"Damn!  All  the wood is wet!"  She exclaimed. "Wait  a second…I came prepared for something like this."  She said, rummaging through her pack.  She pulled out a small propane cylinder: Just enough to heat up  some water.  Maybe Mousse and Ryoga  could help Ranma…or at least they could try to think of something else  together.</p><p>Ranma was thrown back violently by Akane's  foot.  He landed against a tree, making  it shake around, dropping a few leaves.</p><p>Akane approached him, Shampoo jumped in her path,  blocking way.  Akane just smiled.</p><p>"Back for more?"   She asked, smiling menacingly.</p><p>"Shampoo, what are you doin' here?" Ranma asked,  concerned.</p><p>"Shampoo help Ranma…Ranma help Shampoo with husband  and Shampoo not going to sit back and watch you get hurt!"</p><p>"Shampoo that's crazy!"  Ranma yelled, trying to get up.</p><p>"Ranma take break, Shampoo finish this.  Then we cure Akane."</p><p>"Sure…I can finish up with Ranma later.  Doesn't look like she's going anywhere."<br/>Ranma tried to get up, but she  was too tired.  All those previous  wounds came back.  Ranma was defeated  again…for now at least.</p><p>Shampoo leapt into action, swinging at Akane.  Akane jumped back, throwing out a kick.  Shampoo blocked it, shielding her face with  her forearms.  She tried a kick of her  own.  Akane grabbed her foot, throwing  her over her head.  Shampoo landed on  her feet, going back on the offensive.</p><p>"Ugh…" Ranma said to herself.  "Man…There's gotta be something…some sort of  weakness to Akane's cursed form.  Wait a  second…that's what Shampoo is doing!   Giving me a change to study Akane's moves.  That way I could figure out somethin'.  I sure hope she knows what she's doin'."  Ranma turned back to the fight.</p><p>Shampoo caught Akane in the mouth with her  fist.  Akane was sent reeling.  Shampoo launched her fist out again.  Akane's hand shot up, almost like a reflex,  grabbing Shampoo's hand by the wrist.   She turned around, yanking Shampoo up in the air and slamming her on the  muddy ground.  Water and dirt flew  everywhere as Shampoo hit the ground hard.   Shampoo recovered quickly, rolling and springing to her feet.  She charged Akane again.  Akane whirled out of the way, planting a  knee in Shampoo's stomach.  Shampoo fell  to the ground, holding her stomach.</p><p>"Seems the tables have turned Shampoo."  Akane said, looking down at her.  This time Shampoo was on the ground on her  hands and knees, trying to win.  Akane  ruthlessly kicked Shampoo in the face, sending her fully to the ground.</p><p>"Remember that?"   She asked triumphantly.</p><p>Shampoo, now on her back, just looked up to  Akane.  She just couldn't give up so  easily, not after what Ranma had done for her and Mousse.  She also owed it to Akane…</p><p>Akane placed her hands together, making a much  larger blue flame dance there innocently.</p><p>"Now…this is where it ends Shampoo.  After you, I'll finish Ranma!"</p><p>"<i>Tenrai Ryuujin no Hitoare</i>!"</p><p>Mousse arose, having the hot water poured on  him  "Shampoo!  Where are you?"  He asked,  looking around frantically.  Ukyo  pointed to the field of battle in the middle of Jusenkyo.  They both heard Akane announce her  attack.  Mousse's heart jumped, as did  he, running over to Shampoo.</p><p>Shampoo closed her eyes, seeing the blue ball of fire  stream towards her.  It wasn't like the  first time she was hit by it.  This was  different, more controlled.  Suddenly  she heard a voice call out to her.  She  opened her eyes, seeing Mousse take the full force to the attack.  The attack sent Mousse streaming into the  cliff face; striking the rocks so hard he left his own crater on the side to  the cliff.</p><p>"<i>Mousse</i>!"   Shampoo exclaimed, forgetting about her condition and running over to  him.</p><p>"Mousse!  You  big stupid!  Why you do that for!"  Shampoo demanded loudly.  Mousse did not respond.</p><p>"Mousse?"   Shampoo asked quietly.  Mousse  wasn't moving.</p><p>"Mousse…why…you do that?"  Shampoo said, tears in her eyes.   She grabbed Mousse's limp body, crying in his chest.</p><p>"Mousse gave self for me…but didn't have to…Shampoo  actually starting to…like Mousse…but took too long to say it."  She said, weakly.  "Shampoo sorry…"</p><p>Everyone watched the little episode, stunned.  Even Akane was speechless.  Ranma noticed this.</p><p>"Akane <i>is</i> in there somewhere!''  She exclaimed.</p><p>Akane just looked over to Mousse and Shampoo.  For some reason, she felt a bit sad…almost  like she had been in that situation before.</p><p>Shampoo just held Mousse for a few moments, the  whole of Jusenkyo grew eerily silent,</p><p>Suddenly, Shampoo felt a hand around her back.  Her eyes widened, stunned.  Mousse slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>"Shampoo…my beloved…I heard everything…I love you  too."  He said weakly.  Shampoo's hurt feeling's turned into rage.</p><p>"<i>Mousse</i>!   You trick Shampoo again!"  She  shouted angrily.</p><p>Mousse just smiled.   Shampoo looked down at him.  He  risked his life for her.  Shampoo  returned his smile, hugging his burned and beaten form.</p><p>P-Chan looked on, amazed.  Suddenly he felt the familiar sting of hot water.  He was a man again.</p><p>"Oh Ukyo…thank you!"  He said.  "Now…get some  more, I will go douse Akane with that hot water.</p><p>Ukyo nodded.   "Sure thing sugar!"  She said,  turning the knob on the grill.  She  noticed that the grill had cooled down.</p><p>"No…you gotta be kidding…" Ukyo said at a loss.  "Ryoga…the little propane cylinder I used  is…<i>empty</i>!"</p><p>Ryoga's eyes widened.  "<i>What</i>?  Didn't you  pack a fresh one?"</p><p>"No…this was the only one I had left and I didn't  feel like going to the store that day…"</p><p>Ryoga just sat down, at a loss.</p><p>"So…there must be something we can do for  Akane…don't you have any more hot water…"</p><p>Ukyo shook her head.</p><p>Ryoga thought for a minute.  The "Spring of drown girl" was dried, all  the fire wood was turned useless by the rain.   They had run out of hot water.</p><p>"There…there's nothing left…" Ryoga admitted.</p><p>"No…Ranma tried to splash Akane with another spring  a little while ago.  Maybe that would…"</p><p>"Yea I saw that Ukyo.  Did you notice how the twister died down after only a few  seconds.  The contrast between hot and  cold was not enough to keep it powered.   And with the sun shining directly on Jusenkyo…the cold water would warm  up."</p><p>"But…there has to be <i>something</i>!"</p><p>"There is one thing Ukyo, but I could never bring  myself to do it."</p><p>"What?  What  can Ranma do?"</p><p>"He has to beat Akane…that means not holding back in  the slightest.  I doubt Ranma could  bring himself to do that."</p><p>Ukyo just shook her head.  "Well…in the meantime, help me dry off some of this firewood will  ya?"</p><p>Ryoga nodded, he didn't know how they were going to  dry the firewood after that soaking downpour, but they couldn't give up.</p><p>Ranma looked at Shampoo and Mousse there.  Akane had done well to help those two back  then.  He turned to Akane.  She was so different from the Akane back  then.  Just then, Ranma noticed something  about her.  Her guard was down…Ranma  looked to where Shampoo had fallen.  The  grass was scorched and Mousse was burned a bit.</p><p>"Such a high temperature…" Ranma thought to  herself.  She got an idea.  Ranma smiled.  This would put an end to the fight.  All she had to do was get Akane angry enough to use the <i>Tenrai  Ryuujin no Hitoare</i> again.  And that  was easy.</p><p>Akane watched Shampoo and Mousse.  She felt something.  She jumped, avoiding Ranma's <i>Moko  Takabisha.</i></p><p>"Oh…I almost forgot about you Ranma.  Ready to end this?"</p><p>Ranma stood up weakly.  "Just bring it, you stupid Tomboy!"</p><p>Akane was taken aback.  "<i>What</i>…what did you call me?"  She asked, clenching her fists extremely hard.</p><p>Ranma smiled.   "I called you an un-cute, sexless, flat chested tomboyish Macho  Chick!"  Ranma knew she had her now.</p><p>Akane seethed.   "Ranma…you…<i>damn</i> <i>jerk</i>!   I'm gonna…<i>kill</i> you for that!"</p><p>Akane gestured again, unleashing an even more  powerful fireball.</p><p>Ranma smiled.   This was it.  "Ok…cold as  ice…then it would be easy…"</p><p>Ranma turned her battle spirit to cold, calm, and  relaxed.  The fireball streaked towards  him.</p><p>"Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts  Ultimate attack!"  Ranma started to a  surprised Akane.</p><p>"<i>Tenrai Ryuujin no Shoten Ha</i>!"  (Divine Dragon's God's Heaven Blast)</p><p>Ranma punched out to the fireball, just as it was  about to hit him.  The fireball got  absorbed in a giant horizontal twister, turning it blue.  The blue horizontal funnel streamed towards  Akane.  Akane stood there,  immobilized.  She shielded her face with  her arms, taking the full force of Ranma's new attack.  Akane flew backwards, the cold of the  twister seemingly draining her battle spirit.   She lay on the ground on her back, watching Ranma walk up to her.</p><p>Ranma smiled, approaching her.</p><p>"Well Akane…" Ranma started.  "I think that's about it isn't it?"</p><p>Akane tried to get up, but almost all her energy was  taken away, trying to defend against that attack.</p><p>"R-Ranma…You haven't won yet…" She said, sitting  up.  She gripped the ground hard,  scratching up the dirt in her hands.</p><p>"Face it Akane…even with your cursed body, you still  don't have what it takes to defeat me.   Now come on…we gotta get you to another spring or somethin'.  We can't have you goin' home like that.  Mr. Tendou would kill me."</p><p>"This…this can't be…I didn't hold back in the  slightest!"  Akane thought to herself,  gritting her teeth and clenching her eyes shut out of anger.</p><p>"No Ranma…this isn't over…<i>I will beat you</i>!"  Akane screamed, summoning up all her rage  and jumping up to her feet.  She pointed  her hands out towards Ranma; the air started shimmering.  Ranma could feel all the anger in the air.</p><p>Ranma took a step back.  Akane was way passed angry.   The air started to heat up around the two.</p><p>"<i>Take this Ranma</i>!"  Akane yelled, unleashing her ultimate attack.</p><p>Ryoga looked on, seeing a giant blue wall of fire  envelope the two standing there, spiraling upwards to the air.  Ryoga was knocked speechless.  He knew what that was.</p><p>"Ryoga…what's happening?"  Ukyo asked him, concerned.   Shampoo and Mousse turned to Ryoga.</p><p>"I…I don't know how I did it…but when I got  extremely depressed and used my <i>Shi Shi Hokudon</i>, it turned into a giant  crushing pillar of energy.  Akane has  done the same thing with her <i>Tenrai Ryuujin no Hitoare</i>.  The "perfect" Divine Dragon God's rage…"</p><p>"Oh…oh my god…what does that mean Ryoga?"</p><p>"My perfect <i>Shi</i> <i>Shi Hokudon</i> was the  only move that could ever defeat Ranma…"</p><p>"<i>Ranma</i>!"   Ukyo called out to her friend.   It was too late.</p><p>Akane stood in the middle of a burned  Jusenkyo. She was breathing heavily.  A  few of the bamboo poles were smoldering and Jusenkyo had lost a few more  springs to Akane's wrath.  She looked  down, seeing Ranma flung across to the north side of Jusenkyo, near where the  others were.  She was still moving.</p><p>Akane slowly walked over to her position, having  been drained of nearly all her energy.   She approached Ranma, who just laid there, her clothes smoldering.</p><p>"D-damn it!"   Ranma said weakly.</p><p>"Look's like I've finally beat you Ranma…" Akane  started, cracking her knuckles.   "Now…lets just finish this quietly."</p><p>Ranma looked up to Akane.  "No Akane…this ain't over yet!"   She thought to herself.  Ranma  smiled slyly, summoning up the strength to stand on her own will.  Akane was still in there…</p><p>"Want some more Ranma?"  She asked, smiling a bit.</p><p>Ranma retuned her smile…</p><p>"Yes Akane…I do…want some more…of you…" She said,  walking slowly up to her. Something was off with that smile of hers…</p><p>Akane took a step back.  "W…what?  If you wanna  fight, lets go Ranma!"</p><p>"No Akane…I don't want a fight…I just want…you…"</p><p>Everyone was mortally stunned at Ranma's words.  Akane took another step back.</p><p>"I…I never realized how cute you were when you were  angry like that…we shouldn't hold back our feelins' for each other any more."  Ranma said calmly</p><p>"R…Ranma…what are you talking about?"</p><p>"Akane…I want you… now more than ever…"</p><p>"What!"   Akane said, stunned once again.   "But Ranma…you are a Girl…besides, why would I want to do that with you  anyway!"</p><p>Ranma smiled seductively.  "Didn't you want to…back when we shared that bed?"</p><p>"W…well…I thought about it…Wait a second!  We're supposed to be fighting!"</p><p>"I was fighting…fighting all these urges I had.  I can't hold them in any longer Akane.  Even if I can't change back to a guy…I still  need you right now…"</p><p>"Ranma…you pervert!   I would never…"</p><p>Just then Ranma grabbed Akane, planting a passionate  kiss on her lips.  Akane almost lost  herself, but forced her body out of Ranma's arms.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes taking a fighting stance.  "Come on Ranma…let's end this!"</p><p>"Yes, lets…" Ranma said calmly, still walking up to  Akane.  Akane kept backing up.  Ranma was serious about this.</p><p>"N…now wait a second Ranma…what about everyone  here?"  She tried desperately.  Ranma just smiled.  How gross…</p><p>"Ranma…there would be no way we could…we're both  female."</p><p>"We could be creative…"</p><p>Those words froze Akane in her steps.  Ranma again approached her, hugging her and  gently kissing her.  Akane resisted,  pushing Female Ranma back.  Ranma smiled  slyly to her.</p><p>"Gotcha!"   Ranma said, poking Akane in the head.   Akane fell backwards, landing in a spring.  Ranma looked down inside.   The spring was half empty but there was still plenty of water.  Akane looked around a bit, sitting at the  bottom.  Ranma had chosen the right  spring.</p><p>Ranma  breathed a sigh of relief.  She reached  inside, helping Akane up.  Akane  surveyed everyone.  They had no idea  what just happened.</p><p>"Ranma?  What  happened?"  Akane asked.  "Wasn't that a cursed spring I fell into?"</p><p>"Yea it sure was…it was the "Akane-niichaun"</p><p>Everyone just stood there, silently.  Akane looked back in.  She had forgot all about that…tears filled  her eyes.</p><p>"Oh Ranma!  I  knew you would save me!"  Akane said,  hugging her hard.</p><p>"Hey…I told ya I would protect ya'."</p><p>Akane sobbed in Ranma's arms for a few moments.  She tore herself away form him abruptly.</p><p>"What?   Didn't it work?" Ranma asked, stunned.</p><p>"Ranma…if you <i>ever</i> try to seduce me again  I'll rip your hands off!"  Akane said  angrily</p><p>Ranma just smiled, Akane turned to everyone.  They all just smiled at her.</p><p>"Wow Ran-Chan…that was great!"  Ukyo exclaimed.</p><p>Ranma nodded.   Akane started to sob again.   Ranma approached her.</p><p>"Hey…it's over now…why you still cryin'?"</p><p>"Ranma…I…I'm sorry for everything."  Akane said.<br/>Ranma grabbed her hands,  looking into her eyes.  "It's ok…who  would have known all this was gonna happen…"</p><p>Akane just smiled, She brought her head closer to  Ranma, giving her a kiss.  Even though  Ranma was female, Akane still loved him just the same. Besides, Ranma deserved  it.</p><p>Shampoo stood there, watching the exchange.  She turned to Mousse.</p><p>"Mousse!  You  able to stand now?"  She asked,  surprised that he could still move.</p><p>"Yes my beloved.   My love of you is all I needed to forget my injuries!"<br/>A few tears came down  Shampoo's face.  She was happy to see  Mousse standing there.  She grabbed  Mousse, giving him a little kiss on the lips.   Mousse did not protest.</p><p>Ryoga and Ukyo stood next to each other, watching  the other couples kissing and hugging.  They looked at each other.</p><p>"Well…" Ukyo started.</p><p>Ryoga looked into the ground, embarrassed.  "So…I'm uh…glad everything turned out Ok."</p><p>"Yea…me too…" Ukyo said slowly.  Their eyes met again.  They both started to blush a little bit.</p><p>"So you uh…wanna celebrate too?"  Ukyo asked, turning all different shades of  red.</p><p>"No…uh…that's ok…n-not unless you wanted to though…"</p><p>"Well…we might as well…everyone else is doing  it.  When in Rome…"</p><p>They looked at each other, their eyes met  again.  Ukyo's nervous smile disappeared  as she placed her hands around Ryoga.</p><p>"Oh…what the heck" She said. They kissed each other,  happy that everything was finally on the right track.</p><p><u>The  Nannichaun</u></p><p>Everyone sat on the north side of Jusenkyo, relaxing  after a long day.  It started to get  dark.</p><p>"So Ranma…how did you do it?"  Ryoga asked her, sitting next to Ukyo.</p><p>"What'cha mean Ryoga?"</p><p>"How did you finally cure Akane?  How did you bring yourself to strike out  against her like that?"</p><p>Ranma smiled, Akane watching her as she explained.</p><p>"Well…I knew I had to do somethin'.  My original plan was to weaken Akane just  enough so I could splash her with water from a different spring.  That's when I tried my first attack.  I could tell that wasn't gonna do it, what  with the water warming up.  Then Akane  almost killed Mousse and I noticed her looking at them.  That's when I knew Akane was still in there,  somewhere.  I got the idea that if I  used the heat from her attack and my cold battle spirit, I could deal her a  blow that would basically drain her.   Too bad Akane was angry and used the Perfect <i>Tenrai Ryuujin no  Hitoare</i>.  That's when it hit  me.  I ended up on the north side of  Jusenkyo.  Cologne said that there was  an empty spring on that side.  That map  was 100 years old.  That spring <i>must</i>  have been Akane-niichaun.  So…I decided  to try to talk to the Akane under that curse, seeing as she <i>was</i> under  there somewhere.  Of course she was  stunned when I came on to her.  Just  like she got me when she shortened her hair, I got her back.  Good thing my guess was right."</p><p>"What?  A  guess?"  Akane said; a bit surprised.</p><p>Ranma nodded.   "Yea…either you woulda fell into the right one or the wrong one, in  either case I woulda won…although you as anything else but Akane would seem  really strange."</p><p>"So Saotome…you got lucky huh?"  Mousse asked.</p><p>Ranma just smiled.   "I guess we all get lucky sometimes Mousse."  He returned.</p><p>Just then Cologne hopped in, looking around.</p><p>"Did I miss anything?"  She asked, almost knowing exactly what went on.</p><p>"Not a thing" Ranma said, looking at Akane.  She returned a warm smile.</p><p>"Well, that's good.   Where is that Guide?  Is he here  yet?"</p><p>Ranma pointed.   Cologne went over to him, touching a point on the back to his head.  He sat up.   All the guys were stunned.</p><p>"Excuse me sir.   Mind telling us where the Nannichaun is?"</p><p>"Huh…what happen?   Oh…is that one…why you want?"</p><p>Cologne hopped off, standing next to the  spring.  Ranma, Ryoga and Mousse, stood  next to it, mortified.</p><p>Cologne just looked up at them.  "Well…better luck next time I guess."</p><p>The spring to where the guide pointed lay in ruins.  The whole spring was empty…from Akane's attack.</p><p>Tears started down the guy's eyes.  The guide came up to them.</p><p>"Oh…is terrible curse here, kind sirs.  You wanted actually the Nannichaun?"</p><p>Ranma nodded.   "Yea…we all thought we could get cured if we splashed ourselves with the  Nannichaun."</p><p>The guide Smiled,   "Oh…please follow me kind sirs.   I have three Jugs of Nannichaun back at house.  Makes very good curry! Just be careful only put vegetables in."</p><p>With that, everyone shot off to his house,  entering.  The guide came back, holding  three jugs marked in Chinese.   Cologne  nodded.</p><p>"Is last of Nannichaun," the guide said, happily  offering the jugs of the guys.</p><p>Ryoga, Mousse and Ranma ran up to them, holding them  and smiling uncontrollably.</p><p>Ryoga was the first to pop the cork of his.  Mousse followed suit, watching Ryoga.  They smiled at each other, splashing each  other with the water.  They stood there,  drenched, but extremely satisfied.</p><p>"Finally!"   Ryoga shouted, running outside.   Mousse followed.  They just <i>had</i>  to try out their new…or old bodies  held the jar, examining it  closely.  Akane approached him.</p><p>"Well Ranma…this is it…I just wanted to look at  Female Ranma one last time."</p><p>Ranma nodded, popping the cork and raising the  jug.  Something hit her right as she was  going to pour the water over her body.   It was emptiness…Ranma had achieved everything she wanted.  She even forgot about getting cured for the  longest time…why was she hesitating like this.   She was so close to a cure…</p><p>"Ranma?"   Akane asked, concerned.  Ranma  just smiled at her, lowering the jug.</p><p>"Well…something just hit me.  If this were the last of the Nannichaun,  there wouldn't be any more until that spring filled up.  I promised pops I would bring some back for  him…I guess I could wait just a little longer…"</p><p>Akane smiled, giving Female Ranma a giant hug.  Akane felt very relieved all of a sudden.</p><p>"Come on Akane…lets go see how everyone else is doing."  Ranma said, walking outside.  Akane followed.</p><p>Shampoo and Ukyo happily watched Ryoga and Mousse  splash around in the puddles that were left.   They were both staying male.   They were so happy.  The  splashing went long into the night…</p><p><u>A  Journey's End</u></p><p>Cologne sat by the fire later that night.  Everyone decided they should camp out at  Jusenkyo for the night and start back tomorrow.  Ranma awoke, exiting his tent and approaching Cologne.</p><p>"You saw the whole thing didn't you" he asked her.</p><p>Cologne nodded.</p><p>"I knew it…why didn't you help us back there?"</p><p>"If you are to be married, you must learn to solve  your own problems.  I wanted to teach  everyone that final lesson by turning that almost tragedy into a learning  experience."</p><p>Ranma nodded.   "So…that was more trainin' then."</p><p>Cologne nodded again.  She hopped off suddenly, leaving Ranma alone watching the  fire.  Akane tapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>"Oh, sorry Akane…I musta woke you up when I got out  the tent."</p><p>"No, it wasn't your fault Ranma…I had trouble  sleeping in there…I really don't want to be by myself.  I can still see you laying there, hurting  like that.  I hurt everyone today…just  because I wanted to have a bit of fun."</p><p>"Come on Akane, drop it.  Everyone here knows that wasn't the real Akane.  The real Akane is much cuter than  that."  Ranma said warmly.</p><p>Akane just smiled, leaning on Ranma's shoulder.  They sat there, watching the fire for a few  minutes.</p><p>"You know Ranma…a part of me is glad you didn't get  cured…" Akane admitted.</p><p>"Yea I know what you mean.  I would have missed her too.   It had its' advantages…all the food I could eat.  Not to mention I was a lot faster."</p><p>"Our father will be happy to see the  Nannichaun."</p><p>"Our?  Oh  yea…we gotta get married when we get back don't we?"</p><p>Akane just smiled.   "I can't wait.  It's gonna be so  much fun."</p><p>"Yea I know.   Then I guess…we just go from there huh?"</p><p>"Who knows what's next after that…I really don't  care as long as you're with me.  When  two people set their minds to something, they can do anything."</p><p>Ranma nodded.   A few more minutes of silence passed.</p><p>"You know Ranma…I didn't know I was that Obsessed  with beating you in a spar."  Akane  started.</p><p>"I don't think that was really you Akane.  Remember, those Oni guys are evil…and prolly  made you evil too."</p><p>Akane sighed, still leaning on Ranma's shoulder</p><p>"Hey…we better get to sleep.  We have a long way back and then…the big day  will come."  Ranma said.</p><p>"Yea…I guess you're right…"</p><p>"Oh…look what Shampoo found."  Ranma said, holding up Akane's engagement  ring.</p><p>Akane's eyes widened. She hugged Ranma, extremely  hard, placing the ring on her finger.   "Hey…thank Shampoo, she's the one that found it." Ranma finally said</p><p>Akane nodded, tears of joy in her eyes.</p><p>The couple went inside their tent where they quickly  fell asleep.</p><p>*****Man…are we almost finished already? Seems like  just yesterday I had a nothing to lose and posted this. Oh well. Yes. The next  chapter will be the last. Oh…everyone here's been so nice to me **sniffles** I'm  going to miss you all.</p><p>Ok, not really. Like I said, I have three more  fanfics on my HD. The next one I'll post is Just give Me One More Chance. But  that story suffers from the same thing as this one did. It's so early in my  writing experience that I don't think it does me any justice now. So, I've been  working on that. After I post the last chapter of Obsessions, be on the look  out for it. I don't know when it's gonna happen. It might take a while, but it's  a lot shorter than this one. Only 12 chapters. And after that, is where I start  to develop my own writing style. With Grateful Days, and even with the  unfinished "Heart Nibun no Naisho" but that title might change. I still need to  finish that.</p><p>Anyway. Hope you liked this chapter! I hope everyone  is surprised (Those of you that this is your first time reading it) So, until  next we meet!*****</p>
