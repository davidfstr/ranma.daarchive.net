</div><p>Chapter  Eighteen</p><p><u>Oh…Cursed  Bliss</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane walked next to each other, on their  way to Jusenkyo.  They were pretty  quiet, save a comment or two made by one of them.  Akane thought back to all that happened yesterday.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…" she started.  "Did you notice anything strange about Ukyo yesterday or this  morning?"</p><p>Ranma turned to her.  "No…not really, why?"</p><p>"Well…she spent the night in Ryoga's tent…she seemed  awfully embarrassed about something."</p><p>Ranma eyed the two ahead of them.  They were walking next to each other, each  seeming to be in their own little world.   "I dunno…maybe somethin' happened last night when she came back.  It did rain.  He prolly just let her in to get away from the rain."</p><p>"Yea…poor Ukyo.   She still uh… well never mind" Akane said, turning her head from Ranma.</p><p>"She what?"   Ranma asked.  A few seconds  passed, he remembered the whole crying thing.   "Oh yea…none of my business."</p><p>"You know…she was responsible for what happened at  that lake…" Akane started again.</p><p>"Yea…she can be tricky when she wants to."  Ranma returned, looking up to the sky.  The sky was clearing.</p><p>"I dunno Ranma…something tells me that it may have  not been all her fault."  She said,  smiling to herself.</p><p>Ranma looked down to her.  "What are you tryin' to say?"</p><p>"Well for one Ranma.  It would have been easy to tell that I was taking a bath.  I mean that little bucket with the towels  and stuff was right…" Akane started, playfully.</p><p>"Wait a second Akane.  You sayin' I did that on purpose?"  Ranma asked, getting defensive.</p><p>"No…but it was easy to tell…"</p><p>"First of all Akane, I didn't see no bucket layin'  anywhere.  Second, if I really wanted to  see you naked I woulda done so a long time ago."</p><p>"Ok ok Ranma…I get it.  It was a mistake.  I was  just kidding around…"</p><p>"Akane…I woulda never have done anythin' to hurt you  like that."  Ranma returned warmly.</p><p>Akane smiled up to her fiancée.</p><p>"Unless you actually wanted me too.  I guess I could bring myself to spy on you  if you asked me…" Ranma replied, smiling</p><p>Akane's smiled menacingly and she narrowed her  eyes.  "Watch it Ranma…"</p><p>Ranma grinned, waving his hands around.  "Hey...I was only kiddin'. Geeze…taking  things too seriously aren't we?"</p><p>"Don't forget, this is a training trip.  It <i>is</i> serious.  Besides…what makes you think I actually  wanted you of all people to spy on me?"</p><p>"Well…for one you kept lookin' around all the  time…like you were hoping to find someone."</p><p>"No Ranna…I felt like I was being watched is all…"</p><p>"You musta sensed my presence…" Ranma said, amazed.  Ranma did his best to hide his presence from  Akane, but she still picked him up.   "That's pretty amazing Akane…"</p><p>"See…told you Ranma.  Not too much longer now…"</p><p>Ranma thought to himself.  He better step up his training. When Akane was focused on something,  she would never let go until she had achieved it.</p><p>A few more hours passed.  Ukyo could not stop thinking about what Ryoga said to her…and  what had happened.  She turned to Ryoga;  he always seemed to be in a not so good mood.   She kind of felt sorry for him just then.</p><p>"Hey Ryoga…" she started, turning to him.  Ryoga looked on.</p><p>"I forgot to say thanks…for what happened last  night.  It was really nice talking to  you like that…you're a pretty good friend."</p><p>Ryoga smiled at Ukyo.  "No problem.''  He said simply.  He continued walking along, thinking a  bit.  Ukyo <i>was</i> a lot like  Akane.  No wonder those two were such  good friends.</p><p><u>Time to  Relax…</u></p><p>Everyone sat at the campsite, taking a much-needed  break from their training session earlier that day.  Cologne pulled out her map and started reading it.</p><p>"I have a nice surprise for you all.  It would seem there are a series of hot  springs a bit west of this area…" she started.   Everyone perked up.</p><p>"Yes…don't worry; theses are curse free hot  springs.  Why don't you all go relax  there for a little while?  I shall make  dinner for you all when you return."</p><p>Akane got up, holding her towel.  "That works for me!"  She went over to Ukyo and Shampoo.</p><p>"Hey…I think we've earned a little break huh  guys?"  Ranma said to Mousse and  Ryoga.  They nodded, following the girls  to a rather large natural hot springs.   The group stood there, eyeing over the warm steaming springs.  There was a large circular rock formation  that cut the springs in almost half.   The girls took the left and the guys took the right.  There, they relaxed for a little while,  having traveled hard for almost a week.</p><p>Ranma looked over to Ryoga.  He was thinking to himself quietly.  Something was off with him.</p><p>"Hey Ryoga…you don't look too happy over there.  Come on cheer up.  You ain't gonna be a pig for too much longer."</p><p>Ryoga just sat there.  He thought about Ukyo for a little while, then that feeling about  the trip hit him again.  It wasn't as  strong, but he still did care for Akane a lot.</p><p>"Ranma…I must tell you the truth.  I am getting the same ominous feelings about  this trip as you are."  Ryoga finally  said, looking at Ranma seriously.</p><p>"You…you are?"   Ranma got quiet.  He remembered  that feeling.  It wasn't too nice.</p><p>"Well…let's hope it's nothin' Ryoga.  Besides, what could happen?  If Akane fell in a spring, I bet I could  find "spring of drown girl" pretty easily, seein' as I already been there  once."</p><p>"I guess you're right…" Ryoga said, going back to  his thinking.  Mousse slid over to Ranma  and started whispering to him.</p><p>"So…what's wrong with Ryoga?"</p><p>"I dunno" Ranma replied after a few moments.</p><p>"He seems worried about something."</p><p>"Yea…that guy has always been kinda quiet and always  thinkin' like that.  If only I knew what  was goin' on in his head."</p><p>The guys sat there in silence a bit, hearing  laughter from the other side.</p><p>"So…what have you and Shampoo been up to  Mousse?"  Ranma finally asked,  interested and smiling a bit.</p><p>"Well…she let me carry her pack for the entire  trip.  We stayed in the same tent during  the rain.  I wasn't allowed to touch her  or I would lose an arm she said."</p><p>Ranma just shook his head.  Shampoo <i>was</i> paying more attention to him.  Whether it was good or bad was debatable.</p><p>"Well…I'm just glad you finally got your Shampoo  Mousse.  Now that your duel is over I  don't have to worry about either one of ya'" Ranma said</p><p>Mousse nodded.   "Yes…I can't thank you enough for your help Saotome.  I too will apologize to you as a man.  You didn't have to help me."</p><p>"Well…to be honest I did it for Akane.  I didn't trust you in the slightest.  But…seeing Akane trying so hard just moved  something inside me.  I just had to help  after I saw how she forgave you."</p><p>"I cannot blame you Saotome.  After all I did…"</p><p>"Well…you better just make sure you take good care  of Shampoo.  It would be such a waste  otherwise.  I have to say she is kinda  cute…not that actually like her or anything.   That whole tryin' to kill me thing sent that out the window."</p><p>"Indeed, her figure is one of a goddess.  Of course you have a cute one too  Saotome."  Mousse said, smiling.  Ranma turned to him, seeing his eyes with  out his glasses.  That fiery look that  had always burned in them was replaced with one of gratitude and happiness.</p><p>"Yea…Akane is real cute…when she wants to be."  Ranma thought for a few moments.  While they were on the subject…</p><p>"What about  Uc-Chan?  What do you think of  her?"  He asked, smiling a bit.</p><p>Mousse thought for a minute.  "She is cute also, but she may steer some  men away form her with how she dresses.   If she ever started wearing female clothing regularly, suitors would  beat down her door I think."</p><p>"Hmm…yea I remember when she wore that dress to  school.  It was like she was a different  person.  Hey Ryoga!  What'cha think about Uc-Chan?  Think she's cute?"</p><p>Ryoga looked up, coming out of his little  world.  He turned his gaze to the  steaming water, a bit embarrassed.   "Yea…of course I think she is cute.   Not that I would ask her out or anything though."</p><p>"Huh?  We  didn't ask for all that."  Ranma said,  eyeing the man next to him. "Hey…wait a second Ryoga…you don't…<i>like</i>  Uc-Chan do you?"</p><p>"N...no…well not that way.  She is a pretty good friend though.  I see why her and Akane have taken such a liking to each other."</p><p>Ranma shrugged.   "Whatever." He said, turning back and staring at the sky.  "Maybe Akane was right about those two…"</p><p>"Well I'm gonna go get some dinner.  See ya guys later."  Ranma said, after a few minutes.  Mousse also decided to leave.  Ryoga would stay; he needed to think a bit  more.  Akane was his true love but…Ukyo  was kind of cute…he could definitely get used to being friends with Ukyo.</p><p>Akane sat in between Ukyo and Shampoo.  She looked a bit nervous.</p><p>"Why Akane so nervous?"  Shampoo asked, noticing this.   "We no longer threat to Ranma."</p><p>"Yea I know…I guess I should just lighten up  huh?"  Akane started</p><p>"Yea sugar, <i>this</i> is time to relax.  Ranma is safe…until he does something stupid  to you."</p><p>Akane smiled at that last part.  Ukyo knew her well.</p><p>A few moments of relaxed silence passed.  Ukyo was the first to speak.</p><p>"So you guys…your fiancées are finally gonna be  cured.  What's next?"</p><p>Akane thought for a few moments.  It was her turn to answer.</p><p>"I dunno Ukyo.   Ranma…kinda proposed to me a little while ago.  We were going to get married, but then that letter Cologne sent  us arrived.  I told Ranma we should  wait…besides, you should have just seen his face…he was so happy…" Akane  trailed off her words for fear of upsetting Ukyo again.</p><p>Ukyo smiled, almost sadly.  "Yea…he must have been really happy…" Ukyo snapped out of her  brief depression, putting her cheerful face back on.  "So…he proposed to you huh?   How did that go?"</p><p>"Well…we were in bed…and I kinda woke him up  accidentally…"</p><p>Shampoo cut in.   "Oh…Akane and Ranma share bed now?   Tell us all!"  She said, happily.</p><p>"You…you guys…" Akane tried, embarrassed.  "It's not that big of a deal…we just share a  bed…nothing has happened yet."</p><p>Shampoo looked disappointed.  "Well…when you get married?"  She asked</p><p>"Oh…I don't know…probably when we get back from  Jusenkyo"</p><p>"Oh…is good timing.   Shampoo be there also to finish cleaning up Kat Café.  You want Shampoo help cook special wedding  dinner?"</p><p>"Sure Shampoo.   We would love that.  You are more  then welcome to come too Ukyo" Akane said, smiling happily at her.</p><p>She nodded.   "Well Shampoo, what about your fiancée?"</p><p>"Hmph…Shampoo will <i>have</i> to marry Mousse  now.  Shampoo bet Mousse is really happy  too. Shampoo know how Ranma must have felt…"</p><p>Akane looked at Shampoo.  She had stolen the very words from her mouth.</p><p>"You know Shampoo…Ranma avoided his wedding to you  for a long time.  If you didn't want to  marry Mousse you didn't have too."   Akane said</p><p>Shampoo looked stunned.  She was right.   "Well…Shampoo hate to break Amazon aws…besides…Shampoo  actually…tolerating Mousse now."</p><p>The girls sat there a few more minutes, relaxing.</p><p>"Hey…we haven't heard from Ukyo today.  So how are things…with Ryoga?"  Akane said playfully.</p><p>Shampoo widened her eyes.  "Oh…Ukyo love Ryoga now.   When is wedding?"</p><p>"What!  A  wedding…with that guy!  You gotta be  kidding!"  Ukyo said loudly.  Akane and Shampoo laughed at her plight.</p><p>"Oh come on Ukyo…everyone saw you come out of his  tent.  So…what did you two do in there?"</p><p>"It…it wasn't what it looked like!  He just invited me in because of the rain.  Then we just fell asleep…"</p><p>"Is good try Ukyo.   You want Shampoo to cook for your wedding too?"</p><p>"We are <i>not</i> having a wedding!  We aren't even going out!"</p><p>"Come on Ukyo.   I told you all about how I felt about Ranma before we got on the  plane.  Now it's your turn."  Akane said, smiling slyly.</p><p>"Well…if you must know. I did notice that soft side  of him that night Akane.  I was kinda  sad and he tried to cheer me up.  I  guess he could be nice when he wanted to."</p><p>"Yea…told you there were sides of him you didn't  see."</p><p>"Maybe you're right…" Ukyo said thoughtfully.  Ryoga was a very good friend…</p><p>Akane and Shampoo got up to go get dinner.  Ukyo followed them. She felt very relaxed  all of a sudden.</p><p>"Oh man…" Akane started.  "I left my washcloth.   I'll bet it's still in the spring" She started back, taking off the  clothes she had put on.</p><p>Ukyo stopped her.   "Hey…I'll get it.  You go on  ahead.  No sense in you undressing just  for that cloth."</p><p>Akane nodded.   "Thanks Ukyo."  She said, going  back to the campsite.  Ukyo took off her  towel and quickly found the small yellow towel.  She got out and started to dry herself off again…</p><p>Ryoga got out, looking around.  He had no idea where he was or where the  campsite was.  He should have gone with  Ranma and Mousse.  He sighed to himself,  examining the trees carefully.  He would  find his way once and for all!  He heard  someone near the edge of the trees.   That must be Ranma and Mousse drying off.  It was only a few minutes since they had left.  He approached the sound, seeing long black  hair.  It <i>was</i> Ranma and Mousse.</p><p>"Hey Mousse…mind telling me how to…" Ryoga stopped  suddenly, seeing the figure in front of him.   His eyes widened.</p><p>It was Ukyo there, toweling herself off.  She had her foot on a small rock, drying her  leg; her head was facing down to the ground.   Ryoga had forgot his towel, thinking this was the male side of the  springs.</p><p>Ukyo turned, hearing a familiar voice.  Her eyes widened, seeing Ryoga just standing  there, immobilized.  She turned towards  him, confused and stunned at the same time.   She looked down Ryoga's form, almost forgetting what shape <i>she</i>  was in.  She looked down to herself and  started blushing heavily.</p><p>Ryoga was already blushing.  He could feel his nose start to bleed.</p><p>Their eyes met, just for a second.  Ukyo regained herself, hurriedly placing her  hands over her form.</p><p>"<i>Ryoga</i>!   What are you doing!"  She yelled,  trying to hide herself with her towel.</p><p>"U-Ukyo…I though you were Mousse…I got lost…"</p><p>Ukyo wrapped her towel around her body and promptly  slapped Ryoga out of sheer embarrassment.</p><p>"Well if you were lost you didn't have to stare like  that!" She demanded, her face still red.</p><p>"But…I didn't know…I uh…"</p><p>"<i>Ryoga</i> go put some clothes on!"  Ukyo said, noticing she was looking at him  again.  She quickly turned her back to  Ryoga.</p><p>Ryoga ran off hurriedly, leaving what was left of  Ukyo totally embarrassed in the forest.</p><p>"Man…that guy…what a place to get lost in.  But still…why did I stare at him so?" she to  herself, forgetting her embarrassment.   She tried to put the incident out of her mind, getting dressed.</p><p>Ryoga went and got dressed really fast.  He didn't see anyone.  If Ukyo left he would be lost for sure.  He ran to catch up with Ukyo.</p><p>"Ms Ukyo…" he started, bowing.  "Forgive my intrusion earlier, but I can't  find the way back to the camp."</p><p>Ukyo rolled her eyes; at least she was fully  dressed.</p><p>"Ok sugar whatever…" she finally said, forgiving  Ryoga.  "I could only believe one person  could get lost and put me in a situation like that…and that person is you.  Come on, follow me."</p><p>Ryoga followed Ukyo, still blushing a bit.  Ukyo was blushing too.  Awkwardly, the two made it back to the camp,  saying nothing to each other.</p><p>Ukyo handed Akane her little towel.  She noticed Ukyo looked a bit  disturbed.</p><p>"What happened Ukyo?"  She asked</p><p>"Nothing sugar…nothing."  Ukyo said Unconvincingly.   Everyone started dinner.  Ukyo  and Ryoga would keep what happened to themselves…</p><p><u>Jusenkyo…At  Last!</u></p><p>Everyone was sitting there, eating Cologne's  dinner.  Chinese style soba noodles and  a few other things.  Cologne had  finished her meal and was studying the map carefully.</p><p>"Hey Cologne…" Ranma started, his mouth still half  full of food.  "How much longer til we  get to Jusenkyo?"</p><p>"One more day…" she said simply.  That almost made Ranma spit his food out in  surprise.</p><p>"R…really?   Just one more day?"</p><p>Cologne nodded.   Ryoga and Mousse took on Ranma's excited mood.</p><p>"We should get there by tomorrow afternoon."</p><p>Ranma, Mousse and Ryoga, just smiled.  They were really going to do it this  time.  Nothing was going to stop  them.  They would reach Jusenkyo, or die  trying.</p><p>Dinner was finished in a very excitable manner.  Everyone went to sleep, except Akane…she  woke up, emerging form her tent.  That  rain last night scared the guys a bit, so they were taking no chances.</p><p>Something awoke Ukyo, brushing against her ever so  softly.  It was a feather.  She looked around, seeing Akane sitting next  to the dying fire quietly.  Ukyo decided  to go talk to her.</p><p>"Hey sugar…you don't look so happy.  Ranma is finally going to be a real man,  once and for all.  You seem so…not you  right now…"</p><p>"I know Ukyo…" Akane said, turning towards her.  "I am just thrilled that Ranma is going to  be happy…but for some reason, I just can't smile tonight."</p><p>Ukyo thought for a few moments.  "Would you…miss her?"</p><p>Akane nodded.   "Yea I would.  I loved her, just  as much as I did Ranma.  Not in the same  way of course.  We've been together for  so long it was almost like having a second friend for the price of one.  I know Ranma could only see me with his male  eyes.  Whether he was male of female, he  still loved me.  But…I felt like when he  was female, I could relate to him, just like I can you Ukyo.  She was a friend I loved…not romantic love,  but just one I cared a lot about.  I  guess it was stupid for me to treat both sides of Ranma differently."</p><p>"I think I understand Akane.  But…he will still be Ranma, no matter what  form he was in.  You would still be  together in the end.  When it boils  down, it really doesn't matter what curse he has, just as long as he is still  Ranma."</p><p>Akane let out a sigh.  "But the thing is…the cursed Ranma is the only one I knew…it's  like the curse <i>was</i> Ranma…I don't know.   It's hard to explain.  I have  only known the cursed Ranma.  If he were  to be cured, it would be like a different Ranma.  Maybe I'm just being a bit selfish right now.  He will be happy once and for all, but he  doesn't need to do this just because he wants to be a real man.  He <i>is</i> a real man."</p><p>Ukyo looked down to the fire at a loss.</p><p>"I…I don't know what to say Akane…I wish I could  help you out a bit more."</p><p>"Don't worry about it Ukyo.  I just needed someone to listen to me.  I'm starting to feel a little bit better  now."</p><p>"Glad to help Akane.  We should get some sleep.   No doubt those men will be running the whole way there."</p><p>"Yea you're right.   Ryoga and Mousse have worked hard too.   I think we have all got a bit better with Cologne's training."</p><p>"Yea…when we get back I'll show you what I've  learned back at my little shop.  I think  that would be a better atmosphere than the woods."</p><p>Akane smiled at that, something she hadn't done all  night.  "Thanks Ukyo…"</p><p>"Good night."</p><p>"Good night" Akane returned.  She crawled back in her tent, lying next to  Ranma.  She couldn't help but look at  him, sleeping there.  He seemed so  peaceful.  Only one thing was on his  mind.  At least his mind was clear right  now.  Akane rolled over, placing an arm  across Ranma.  She took a deep breath.  As long as Ranma was happy…that's all she  wanted.  After a while they would forget  about that red haired girl and all the trouble…and fun she caused.</p><p>Ranma awoke bright and early the next morning.  Today was the day…he would be cured today,  if all went well.  He went outside,  looking at the early morning sky through the trees.  It was just past sunrise.   Cologne was up and about fixing breakfast.  Something struck Ranma as he watched Cologne prepare the  fire.  He wasn't as excited as he was a  few days ago.  Ranma shook all the  thoughts out of his head.  If he really  wanted to be cured, he better do it now, although he had finally got everything  he wanted, even before he even knew about this trip…</p><p>Everyone finished breakfast.  Ryoga and Mousse were clearly ecstatic, starting  off in front of everyone else.  Ranma  walked next to Akane, and Shampoo followed Mousse down the trail.  She seemed to be hanging around him, almost  like she enjoyed his company.  Ukyo  brought up the rear; she was a bit confused after what happened yesterday.</p><p>After a few hours, the group started walking on a  very familiar cliff face.  The rocks  were gray and there was a massive forest beneath them.  Cologne hopped past a wooden arrow, planted  in the stone ground.  The arrow was  pointing the way to Jusenkyo.  This was  it…Minutes away form their ultimate goal.</p><p>"So Ranma…what are you thinking now?  Only a little further…"  Akane asked</p><p>"I can't wait Akane…I've always wanted this…but…"</p><p>Akane looked a bit shocked.  "But what?"</p><p>Ranma smiled, he shouldn't worry Akane like  that.  "Oh…it's nothing."   Akane looked over Ranma.  No way he could be thinking what she thought  he was.  She looked to the horizon.  A few bamboo poles were sticking into the  sky.  There were a few glimmers in  between the moving leaves, gently rocking back and forth.  No doubt some poor soul met their fate in of  those shimmers.  A fate to be shared by  all that fell inside.  Akane took a deep  breath.  Goodbye…girl type Ranma…</p><p>The party entered the north end of Jusenkyo through  two valleys.  Mousse and Ryoga were  waiting there, having run ahead of everyone else.  They were looking excitedly into the springs, not daring to get  too close to them.  Any one could mean  salvation, or more torture…</p><p>Ranma breathed in the fresh, familiarly damp air. He  looked to Akane.  She seemed happy  enough, but something was wrong. His stomach suddenly turned.  That bad feeling had returned, it was worse  than ever.  He had to say something.</p><p>He went up to Akane.  "Hey Akane…" he said, seriously</p><p>Akane looked up in his eyes, seeing all that was  inside him.</p><p>"Akane…I got a bad feellin' about this.  About you bein' here."</p><p>Akane rolled her eyes.  "Oh Ranma…you know good and well…"</p><p>Ranma cut her off, taking her hand, feeling the  engagement ring he had given her.   "Akane…I'm not kiddin around.  I  know you will be fine but…promise me you will be careful in here.  I couldn't stand it if anythin' happened to  you…right before our wedding."</p><p>Akane just looked into Ranma's pleading eyes.  She nodded, slowly.  "Ranma…don't worry.  Everything will be fine."</p><p>Cologne started to address everyone.</p><p>"Well…after much hardships, we have arrived.  All of your skills have improved and shall  be rewarded now."  Cologne pulled out an  ancient scroll.</p><p>"Hey…what's that?"   Ranma asked.</p><p>"This is the list of all the springs in  Jusenkyo.  The only list left.  This dates back through 3000 years of  Chinese-Amazon history.  This is the  most recent one, written 100 years ago"</p><p>Ranma dashed over, snatching it quickly.  Ryoga and Mousse neared him.  They looked upon that tattered piece of  paper, like some sort of holy object.   Quickly their faces turned sour, feeling betrayed by the very fate that  lead them here.</p><p>"Oh…yes that's right.  It's written in Chinese.   I will help you all out."</p><p>"N-no…it's not that Cologne."  Ranma said, holding out the paper, showing  everyone.</p><p>Everyone drew closer, examining the paper.  The ink was swirled around, causing a jumble  of unrecognizable colors on the paper.   Cologne took the paper, eying it carefully.</p><p>"It would seem it got wet during that rain…Son in  law…did you bring <i>all</i> the gear inside our tent."</p><p>Mousse thought for a minute.  He shook his head slowly.  He had left it under a tree, thinking it  would stay dry.  Water from the ground must  have leaked inside the pockets, causing the ink to run and swirl.</p><p>Ranma sighed, disappointed.  "<i>Great</i>…this is just great…I try to  get here for what seemed like years.   And when I finally do, something screws it up, like always."</p><p>"Saotome…I'm sorry.   It was my fault…"</p><p>"Well…none of that is gonna get the map back is  it?"  Ranma looked around, seeing a few  animals in the forest.</p><p>"Come on…grab a squirrel or somethin'.  We will find out the hard way what each  spring is!"  Ranma said, running  off.  Akane grabbed his shirt, preventing  him from moving.</p><p>"Ranma…how cruel!"   She scolded.</p><p>"Yea Ran-Chan…just relax…I'm sure there is a way…"  Ukyo started</p><p>Everyone stood there, thinking.</p><p>Ryoga spoke up.   "Hey…that little guide person knows all the springs.  I'll bet he could help us…"</p><p>Ranma widened his eyes.  He ran up to Ryoga, putting his hands on his shoulders.  "Ryoga…<i>you</i> are a genius!  All we have to do is find him!"  He said, looking around frantically.</p><p>Everyone, except Ryoga fanned out to search the  area.  Ryoga waited at the entrance,  hoping that little guide person would show up.   They never found him.</p><p>"Damn!"   Ranma cursed.  "That little freak  is no where to be found.  He seemed to  just wait around here, like it was his job or somethin'."</p><p>"Do not worry Ranma.  He will return.  I  informed him of our journey.  I told him  we did not need a guide however, seeing as I had the map and can speak Chinese  fluently.  He should be back soon."</p><p>All the guys sighed heavily.  Ryoga just went and sat down on a rock,  punching holes through the nearest cliff-face out of sheer boredom.</p><p>A few hours passed.   Everyone sat around, bored.   Ranma went walking around, hoping to see something.</p><p>"Maybe this one…"Ranma said, thoughtfully looking  in.  The water looked safe enough.</p><p>"I wouldn't if I were you Ranma…who knows what drown  in that spring."</p><p>"I know Akane…I just hate this waiting around  business."</p><p>The couple looked around at all the bamboo poles and  such.  Shampoo stood, looking into a  pool.  Ranma and Akane approached  her.  She smiled, taking a step and  falling right in.</p><p>"Shampoo!"   Ranma yelled.  She soon emerged  out of the water in the same shape she had been previously, only wetter.  She hopped out, Mousse bringing her a towel.</p><p>"Is "Spring of Drown Girl''.  Surely Ranma know this one…" Shampoo  started.</p><p>Ranma neared the spring, Akane next to him. "Shampoo  had wanted to get cured for Ranma…but since Ranma has new fiancée…Shampoo not  know what to do.  Mousse said might as  well, so Shampoo jump in."  She said,  smiling.</p><p>Ranma  looked at Shampoo, tolerating Mousse's proximity to her.  She even listened to him just then…Akane  looked inside the spring.  "So…that's  where it all started huh?"</p><p>Ranma turned to Akane, nodding.  "Yea…you could blame a million things on  whoever that girl was that drown there so long ago."</p><p>"Better a girl than some sort of creature…or  monster."<br/>"Guess you're right about  that…" he said, trailing off, looking into that water.  It had changed his very existence.  It caused him so much hardship.  It caused him so much embarrassment.  Could it have also helped him get  Akane?  Ranma thought for a bit,  thinking on what would have happened if he had not been cursed.</p><p>Suddenly, Ranma hit on something.  " Wait a sec Shampoo…how did you know this  was the "Spring of Drown Girl?"</p><p>"Great-grandmother told."  Shampoo said, seeing Ranma race off towards Cologne.</p><p>"Cologne!   You can read the map?"  He asked  frantically.</p><p>"No Ranma…only the north side of Jusenkyo was spared  from the rain."</p><p>"So…what are the names of the springs on the north  side…maybe one is the Nannichaun."</p><p>Cologne read off the words for everyone.</p><p>"Spring of drown bear.  Spring of drown boar.   Spring of drown girl…. Drown mother.   Drown Viking.  Drown  blacksmith.  Drown Panda.  Drown spider.  Drown eagle… There is also an empty spring near…nothing yet has  fallen inside of it.  No spring of drown  man…unless you want to take your chances with either the Viking or  blacksmith."</p><p>Ranma thought for a second.  Akane elbowed him.  "Don't even think about it Ranma.  You as a Viking…they were awfully cruel to women."</p><p>"I dunno…that blacksmith is prolly male.  I could get cured and as an added plus, make  money by forgin' stuff."</p><p>"Oh…wait a second Ranma.  That was Spring of Drown Black horse."</p><p>Ranma shrugged.   "So much for that then huh…that guide better get here soon or I'm gonna  go crazy out of boredom."</p><p>"Hey Ranma…if you're bored…" Akane started, smiling.</p><p>Ranma looked at her, smiling there.  Something was going on inside her head.  She was plotting something.  Ranma's eyes widened.</p><p>"No way Akane…"</p><p>"Oh, come on, why not?"  She asked playfully.   "Scared I'll beat you?"</p><p>"No Akane, I'm scared that you would fall in a  spring."</p><p>"Ranma…we know where the "Spring of Drown Girl  is.  What could happen?  If I fell in a spring I would just take a  quick dip in there."</p><p>"Well…what about me Akane…what if I fall into  another spring?"</p><p>"Same thing.   If it deletes your current girl curse, we would just dunk you in the  spring of Drown Girl.  Not like you  haven't been there before."</p><p>Ranma thought for a few moments.</p><p>"Besides Ranma…that guide will be here in a  while.  He could tell us where all the  springs were."</p><p>"I don't know Akane…"Ranma started.  He made the mistake of looking into Akane's  eyes.  They were so cute…and her smile could  not be resisted.  That face of hers held  mysterious powers the likes of which he had never experienced.<br/>Ranma sighed.  "Fine Akane.  You have yourself a spar.   No holds barred."</p><p>"Great!  I've  always wanted to see what this place was like.   Get ready Ranma, you're in for it."</p><p>Ranma's confident side returned, making his common  sense go out the window.  He hopped up  on a pole.  Akane followed suit.</p><p>"Now…here is the time you learn the essence of the  Anything Goes style of Martial arts.   This is a style that excels in mid air."</p><p>Ryoga looked on.   Ukyo was next to him.</p><p>"This should be good, huh sugar?"  Ukyo asked.</p><p>Ryoga nodded.   "Yea Ukyo.  Ranma has improved a  lot…but so has Akane."</p><p>The two turned to each other, looking into each  other's eyes.  They smiled, seeming to  forget what had happened between them.   Maybe they could be pretty good friends.</p><p>"So…a pig huh…what was that like?"  Ukyo asked, breaking the ice.</p><p>"Well…it has its advantages…" Ryoga started.  The two talked while watching the fight.  Mousse and Shampoo sat quietly on a nearby  rock, looking at the two hop back and forth.</p><p>"Come on Ranma…is that your best?"  Akane asked, leaping into the air.  The two converged, trading blows.  Neither was able to land a hit.</p><p>"Geeze Akane…you weren't kiddin'" Ranma said.</p><p>"Told you Ranma."</p><p>The two leaped at each other again.  They landed on opposing poles, turning  around to face each other.</p><p>"Not good enough though.''  Ranma said, smiling.</p><p>"Please Ranma…you didn't even touch me"</p><p>Ranma shook his head, waving a yellow headband in  the air.  That was Akane's  headband.  She was wearing her shorts  and a loose shirt.  She put the headband  on to prevent sweat from entering her eyes.   She didn't even feel Ranma do that.</p><p>"Ranma…" Akane started.  She focused on her target, smiling there triumphantly.</p><p>"Maybe that's his weak spot…his confidence."  Akane stood there, thinking for a moment.</p><p>"Hey Akane!   We done yet?"</p><p>Akane eyed Ranma, smiling slyly.</p><p>"No Ranma…this has only begun!  Catch me if you can!"  Akane said, springing off towards the south  of Jusenkyo.  Ranma followed, watching  Akane jump form pole to pole.  She was a  natural…</p><p>Suddenly, Ranma heard a loud <i>snap.  </i>He watched in horror as the bamboo pole  Akane jumped to crumbled to the ground, taking Akane with it.  His heart jumped, that awful feeling came  back.  He could have kicked himself for  agreeing to this if he wasn't diving down to catch Akane.</p><p>Akane made a giant splash as she landed inside a  spring…<br/>"<i>Akane</i>!"  Ranma yelled, approaching the spring.  All that was inside were a lot of bubbles  and a dark figure at the bottom.  Ranma  took a step back and jumped in.</p><p>"Ran-Chan!   What the <i>hell</i> are you thinking!"   Ukyo yelled, throwing her massive spatula and hitting Ranma in the  chest.  The force of the blow knocked  the wind out of him as he landed on the hard dirt.</p><p>He quickly got up, furious.  "Uc-Chan!   Akane can't swim!  She's gonna  drown!"</p><p>"Ran-Chan!   Get a hold of yourself.  You do <i>not</i>  want to jump in there.''</p><p>Ryoga grabbed Ranma from behind, holding him in  place.</p><p>"Let go of me Ryoga!  Akane is drownin'!"  He  demanded.</p><p>"Ranma…you will accomplish nothing by jumping in  there.  What if what ever drown in there  had no arms…or no legs?"</p><p>"Well we gotta do <i>somethin</i>'!"</p><p>Mousse approached, lashing out a volley of chains  into the spring.  He felt the chains go  taught, like some sort of weight had grabbed a hold.</p><p>"Ranma…don't worry.   I have her."  Mousse said,  pulling up the heavy weight.</p><p>Ranma watched in horror, seeing the dark figure  materialize from the depths of the spring.   He turned his head, clenching his eyes.   He couldn't bare to see what Akane had become as a result of him not  listening to himself.</p><p>"Oh my…" Ukyo said stunned.  She looked at Akane…</p><p>Ranma was unable to open his eyes…out of fear…</p><p>*****Heh. That's it for that chapter. Let me say  something here real fast. I certainly hope people read this, as I don't want  any comments about it. AKANE DID NOT FALL INTO THE SPRING OF DROWN MAN. There, I  hope that was clear. It's a spring I made up one night when I think I was  pissed off. Or maybe I wasn't. I can remember the night. I think it was cold.  Anyway, big surprise in the next chapter! What spring did Akane fall into?  Guess you'll have to wait and see.</p><p>Oh…and I said that was it for the cliffhangers. My  bad. I honestly forgot about this. Oh well. What are you gonna do? Until next  we Meet!*****</p>
