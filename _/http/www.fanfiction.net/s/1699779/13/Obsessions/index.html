</div><p>Chapter  Thirteen</p><p><u>Fruits of  Labor</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane looked at each other in the training  hall.  The session was over for  today.  Mousse had gone to where ever he  always went to.</p><p>"So Ranma…what do you think?"  Akane asked, concerned for Mousse.</p><p>"I dunno Akane…Mousse has potential…but its gonna  take a long time to bring him up to Shampoo's level.  Maybe back a few months ago, Mousse woulda stood a better  chance."</p><p>"Yea I know.   Like I said, Shampoo is as fast as you now.  She may even be faster.   Who knows what her and Cologne are up to, now that they don't have a  son-in-law to pester."</p><p>"I really don't think they are trainin 'or  anythin'.  I bet they are savin' their  money to go back to China."</p><p>"Yea, Shampoo told me not to worry, that she would  find a husband back in China.  I wonder  when they are planning to go back.   Think they will stay there?"</p><p>"I dunno…I guess it all depends on how this fight  with Shampoo and Mousse goes.  If he  wins I'll bet they go to China and stay."</p><p>Akane nodded   "Well…all we can do is hope that Mousse's love reaches Shampoo."</p><p>"Yea…" Ranma said, rising.  "Well…I'm gonna go take a bath.   See ya at dinner."</p><p>Akane nodded, following Ranma to the dinner  table.  She would take her bath after  Ranma.</p><p><u>Forgiveness?</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane sat at the dining table the next  morning, having finished breakfast about a half hour ago.  A knock came from the door.</p><p>"I'll get it!"   Akane said, approaching the door.   She opened it.  Mousse stood  before her, his glasses glinting in the sun.   Akane let him in.  Ranma stood a  little bit away, leaning on the wall.</p><p>"Ready for more Mousse?"  Ranma said, smiling.</p><p>Mousse returned a sly smile.  "Of course Saotome.  Since I have a male to fight, I won't have  to hold back."</p><p>Akane took offence to that.  "Hey…you better not hold back against  Shampoo, even if you <i>did</i> hold back against me."</p><p>"Rest assured I would do no such thing.  If I have to go all out to get my beloved  Shampoo, then I shall, even if it means defeating her, for her own sake."</p><p>"What a guy…" Ranma said.  "Well let's get this over with."</p><p>Ranma and Mousse stared at each other.  They were sill a bit bitter at each other,  but decided to set their differences aside, both for their true love.</p><p>"Mousse…if you want to beat Shampoo, you must  improve your speed.  You may be stronger  than she is, but without speed, your strength won't matter."</p><p>"So…Saotome…what should I do?"  Mousse asked.  Those words were extremely hard for him to say, but all he wanted  was Shampoo.  He would not stop until he  had proven himself to her.</p><p>"Akane…can you get me a glass of water?"  Ranma asked.  Akane looked at him confused.</p><p>"Sure…"</p><p>Akane returned with the glass of water.</p><p>"You know…I have a little sports bottle I always  keep with me, in case you get thirsty…" Akane trailed off her words, seeing  Ranma splash himself with the cold water.</p><p>"All you have to do is manage to hit me while I'm a  female.  If you could do that, you could  hit Shampoo."  Female Ranma said.</p><p>Mousse nodded, smiling his menacing smile.  "Very well Saotome."</p><p>Ranma took a defensive stance.  Mousse charged her, closing in with a high  kick.  Ranma ducked the blow  easily.  Mousse launched another kick to  Ranma's midsection.  Ranma placed her  hands on Mousse's leg and sprang upwards, coming down perfectly.  Mousse whirled on her, dashing to her  position with a punch.  Ranma leapt into  the air, flipping over Mousse and landing.   Mousse launched a backward kick towards Ranma's position.  Ranma caught the leg, spinning Mousse around  to face her.  Swiftly, Ranma plucked the  glasses off of Mousse's head.</p><p>"Hmm…this is gonna be a problem, isn't it?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>Mousse stood there, wondering what was in front of  him.  He looked every which way, spying  a figure in the corner.  He approached  it.</p><p>"Yes Saotome.   Indeed Shampoo would figure out that with out my glasses I could not  win.  She is quite found of doing that  to me."</p><p>"Hey, over here."   Ranma said, tapping Mousse on the shoulder.  He handed the glasses to him.   Mousse put them on hastily.  He  looked at Ranma, seeing clearly again.   He turned to where he was first talking.  It was a punching post wrapped in rope.</p><p>Ranma just shook her head.  "Well…worry about that later.   Lets get back to work."  Ranma  said, taking her stance again.  Mousse  resumed his fight.</p><p>The two continued to train.  Akane sat and watched.  Ranma wasn't even trying but Mousse was  giving it his all.</p><p>"This doesn't look good for Mousse."  Akane thought to herself.  "Well…if anyone could help him, it would be  Ranma."</p><p>It was about 4 o'clock when Ranma decided she had  had enough.</p><p>"Ok Mousse.   I think that is enough for today.   Something is missing though…"</p><p>Akane spoke up.   "Mousse can't use his techniques in here…he might damage the Dojo."</p><p>"Like that ever stopped anyone before…" Ranma said  under her breath.  "Well…let's meet here  tomorrow, then we can go to that area Akane went to train."</p><p>Mousse nodded, hands placed in his massive  sleeves.  "Thank you."  He said simply, walking away calmly.</p><p>"That Mousse guy will never change."  Ranma said, Akane coming along side of  him.  Ranma turned to Akane.</p><p>"Well…I'm beat, I'm gonna relax a while."</p><p>"I'm just gonna spend a bit of time in here."  Akane said, gathering her training supplies</p><p>"Sure Akane."   And with that Ranma left the training hall, heading for a nice relaxing  bath.</p><p>Akane trained for about one more hour, before  calling it a night.  It was almost time  for dinner and she was a bit hungry.</p><p>Everyone sat at the dinner table, eating the  wonderful food.</p><p>"Hey Kasumi, another great job."  Ranma said, his mouth full of food.</p><p>"Yes Kasumi, such a wonderful meal.  We are in your debt."  Soun said, smiling.</p><p>"Thank you so much everyone.  It's the least I can do.  I'm so glad everyone is happy with  dinner."  Kasumi said with her bright  smile.</p><p>A few moments passed.</p><p>"So Ranma…I hear you and Akane are stepping up your  training."  Genma said.</p><p>"Well, Akane is the one giving it her all.  She is Obsessed with the idea that one day  she will beat me in a match."</p><p>"Ah…that is good news.  Carrying on a Dojo will prove difficult.  Many people will come and challenge you for  your sign."  Genma continued.</p><p>Akane looked up to him.  "Well Uncle Saotome…I didn't think anyone really did that  anymore."</p><p>Genma looked at Soun.  He shrugged.  "Well, none  the less, you must be prepared for anything."</p><p>"Actually…Ranma and I are helping that Mousse  character train.  That's what has been  going on the last couple of days."   Akane admitted.</p><p>"Mousse…" Nabiki said thoughtfully.  "Isn't he that guy that tries to always kill  Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma nodded.   "Yea…<i>one</i> of em…"</p><p>"So why are you helping him out then?  I would just let him figure out how to solve  his own problems."  Nabiki said bringing  her chopsticks up to her mouth.</p><p>"That's what I told Akane.  But she is determined repay Mousse for what he did."</p><p>"And what is that?"   Soun asked.</p><p>"Well…" Akane began   "Remember all those techniques I learned?  Mousse was the one responsible for me learning them."</p><p>"How so?"</p><p>"Mousse was the one that gave me that book I learned  from."</p><p>"I see…" Soun said solemnly.  "Well no doubt, your since of honor did not  allow you to turn your back on him."</p><p>Akane nodded.   "Ranma finally decided to help out…after he came to his senses."</p><p>Ranma turned to Akane.  "Hey…you try helpin' a guy that's tried to kill you more than a  hundred times.  See how ya' feel about  him then!"</p><p>"Ranma…that's not the point.  As a martial artist you should have been the  first one in line to help him."  Akane  returned forcefully.</p><p>"I can't just forgive Mousse as fast as you did  Akane.  Remember, he never actually  tried to kill you."</p><p>"Still Ranma…"</p><p>Ranma cut her off.   "No…there is no "Still Ranma" stuff in this argument.  He tried to kill me <i>and</i> kidnapped  you.  How can I forgive him so easily?"</p><p>Akane looked fiercely at Ranma.  "Well…it seems like you did just that  earlier today didn't you?"</p><p>Ranma scoffed at such a remark.  "Yea right Akane.  I only did what I did because there was no chance for him to beat  Shampoo with <i>your</i> training."</p><p>"<i>Hmph</i>!   Whatever Ranma!  I think you <i>did</i>  forgive him today.  Why else would you  have volunteered to help him?"</p><p>"Y-you have got to be kiddin'!"  Ranma said,   "There is no way I could do that."</p><p>Akane just sat there eating her food. Ranma turned  back to his plate and followed suit.</p><p>"Un-cute…"</p><p>"Pervert…".</p><p>The rest of the household was busy talking amongst  themselves, completely ignoring Ranma and Akane's little argument with each  other.  They were discussing Nabiki's  plans for college.</p><p>Slowly, everyone finished dinner; Ranma went  upstairs to sleep and Akane decided to catch up on some TV for once.</p><p>Ranma lie in his bed, he was just a bit tired from  this session with Mousse.</p><p>"I think you <i>did</i> just forgive him today"  Akane's voice echoed in his mind.</p><p>Maybe he did…maybe he did it for Akane's sake.  Ranma just decided to go to sleep.  All that thinking made his head hurt.</p><p><u>Pressed  for Time</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane awoke at the same time in the  morning.  Ranma emerged from his room,  yawning a bit.  Akane was heading down  the stairs, dressed for the day.  Ranma  followed her.</p><p>"Hey Akane…what are you doin' dressed like that?"</p><p>"Huh?  What  are you talking about?"  Akane asked.</p><p>Ranma indicated her short red skirt and white  top.  "Those really aren't trainin'  clothes…"</p><p>"Oh…well I was gonna let you two train for  awhile.  I still wanted to talk to  Cologne.  Maybe she could help us out."</p><p>"Well…ok then…"</p><p>Ranma noticed that Akane standing at the bottom of  the steps, a bit perplexed.  Ranma  approached her, standing next to her.   Mousse was already inside the house and sitting at the dining table  having breakfast.</p><p>Ranma and Akane looked at each other, a bit  confused.</p><p>"Good morning Ranma and Akane Saotome."  Mousse said, turning his head to see  them.  His tall form looked a bit  awkward at such a small table.</p><p>"Mousse?   What are you doin' here so early?"   Ranma asked</p><p>"Oh…I saw our friend Mousse earlier today."  Kasumi said, smiling.  "I had run out of eggs and went to the store  to get some. Mousse was there and I invited him over for breakfast."</p><p>"Oh…that's good.   I thought I had overslept or somethin'" Ranma replied, sitting in his  seat.  Akane sat next to him and began  eating.</p><p>After a few minutes, the rest of the family joined  everyone at the table.  Things were a  little bit awkward, but Kasumi was oblivious, enjoying having another mouth to  feed.</p><p>"Ok Saotome.   I am finished."  Mousse said,  rising.</p><p>"Oh Nonsense!"   Kasumi said.  "You barely had  anything at all.  Please, have some  more."</p><p>"Oh…no that's ok."   Mousse said, a smile starting on his face.</p><p>"No…I insist.   There is plenty for everyone!"   Kasumi returned warmly.</p><p>"You are too kind Kasumi Tendou."  Mousse said with a nervous chuckle.  He really did want to eat more.  With that he sat back down, convinced he  could have his fill.</p><p>Ranma and Akane rose from the table.</p><p>"That was good Sister!" Akane said, heading to the  door.  Kasumi smiled.</p><p>"Ready to go?"   Akane asked, turning to Mousse and Ranma</p><p>"Sure Akane…let me go change real fast."</p><p>"Yes Akane Saotome.   I'm ready."  Mousse said, again  rising from the table.  He turned to  Kasumi and bowed.  Everyone smiled at  that.</p><p>"Umm…you can just call me Akane.  Ranma and I aren't married yet."</p><p>"Oh…I see…" Mouse said apologetically.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Mousse started to the vacant  lot.  Akane was thinking to herself.</p><p>"I wonder where all those manners came from?"  She asked herself.  "Mousse has never been that polite before…ever."  She turned her look into the sky.  It looked like clouds were starting to  gather.  Maybe it would rain  "Akane Saotome?  That sounds <i>so</i> weird.   I bet I could get used to it though…"</p><p>The three reached the vacant lot.  Ranma and Mousse took their respective  positions.  Akane splashed Ranma with  the cold water.</p><p>"You never get tired of doing that do you?"  Ranma asked</p><p>Akane just smiled</p><p>"Well…shall we get started?"</p><p>"That we shall, Saotome!"</p><p>Ranma eyed over Mousse.  He was standing opposite of him, chuckling to himself.  His hands were in his massive sleeves.</p><p>Suddenly he leaped into the air, firing off a volley  of spiked chains and blades.</p><p>Ranma narrowed her eyes.  She stuck up her right arm, blocking one, she grabbed the second  with her left, spun around, avoiding a few more, and used the one she had  captured to block the last series.   Satisfied, Ranma looked up, seeing Mousse coming down with a kick.  Ranma sidestepped the kick.  Mousse, his back facing Ranma, whirled  around, unleashing a volley of daggers.</p><p>Ranma smiled.   She kicked the first two, spinning them in the air and grabbing them by  the handle.  Skillfully, she spun the  two daggers around, forming a type of shield, blocking the rest of them. Mousse  then charged Ranma, launching a series of high kicks.</p><p>Akane watched the spar for a few more minutes,  before deciding to see Cologne.</p><p>"Those two will be fine."  She said to herself.  She  walked for a little bit, pondering different stuff.</p><p>She arrived at the Kat Café.  She lowered her head to get inside.  It didn't look real busy at all.  Akane turned to look outside.  It was still early in the morning.  She sat down at the table.</p><p>"<i>Nihao</i> Akane!"  Shampoo said, smiling energetically.</p><p>"Good morning Shampoo."  Akane returned, smiling her cute smile.</p><p>"Akane, you want today special?  Is Ramen and Soba noodles."</p><p>"Sure Shampoo.   I'll take the Ramen"</p><p>"Ok" Shampoo said, going to the kitchen.</p><p>Akane eyed her as she entered the kitchen.  She still had her energetic mood…but  something wasn't right about her…something was missing.</p><p>Cologne peeked her head out, spying Akane looking  around the café in her own little world.</p><p>"Oh Good.  I  have been meaning to speak with you Akane."   Cologne said, emerging from the kitchen</p><p>"Huh?   Oh…good morning Cologne.  Hey…you  know that new martial Arts school…"</p><p>"Shampoo" Cologne called, turning her head from  Akane.  Akane looked suspiciously at  her.</p><p>"Yes great-Grandmother?"</p><p>"I will take care of Akane's order.  Would you go and deliver this to the Yamato  Residence?"</p><p>Shampoo nodded, taking the metal container from  Cologne and grabbing her bike.  The  sound of her bell down the street signaled it was ok for Cologne to talk.</p><p>"Umm Cologne…is something wrong?"  Akane asked concerned.</p><p>"Well…this may not concern you but I just wanted to  tell you that we are leaving for China in one week's time."</p><p>Akane was stunned.   "W…why?"</p><p>"Ever since the day after the duel…something has  been wrong with Shampoo.  She seems to  be depressed, and has been acting like that for almost two months now.  I am starting to get concerned.  Maybe going back to China will calm her  tortured soul."</p><p>"I…I'm sorry about all this…" Akane said sadly</p><p>"No Akane…it was not your fault.  The fates chose you to win that duel."</p><p>"But the only reason I won was…"</p><p>"Yes I know about what Mousse did.  It was fate that lead Mousse to a book lost  for over 300 years."</p><p>"Wait a second…About Mousse…Ranma and I were  training him so maybe one day…"</p><p>"That will not work Akane."  Cologne said grimly</p><p>"W…why not?   If Mousse beats Shampoo, won't she have to marry him?"</p><p>"I'm afraid not.   That rule only works on outsiders.   If an outsider is able ever to defeat someone of the opposite gender,  they must be incredibly strong, hence our rule."</p><p>"But Mousse is from the same tribe as you.  How come he agreed to it?"</p><p>"I have an idea of what he is planning.  He would risk his future on one last fight  for Shampoo."</p><p>Akane looked at Cologne confused.</p><p>"I love my granddaughter very much and I would do  anything for her.  If Mousse going to do  what I suspect he will, he may come through at last."</p><p>Akane was again confused.  She sat there silently</p><p>"I believe Shampoo has feelings for Mousse, but  their childhood prevents her from bringing those feelings up."</p><p>"Well…what happened?"</p><p>"Mousse has very poor vision.  Shampoo hated the fact that he could mistake  inanimate objects for her.  Childish  yes…but they <i>were</i> children.   Those hurt feelings turned into hatred as Shampoo grew older."</p><p>"Oh…so why did you want to talk to me?"</p><p>"I had to explain myself for temporarily halting our  training."</p><p>"Oh…don't worry about that, besides, Ranma is  helping me out a bit more."</p><p>"Well, excuse me Akane, I must get back to the  kitchen."  Cologne said.</p><p>Akane finished her ramen and started back to the  Dojo.  She walked along the street,  passing Shampoo.  She did seem a bit out  of it, as if her spirit was very low…</p><p>"Almost two months…" Akane thought to herself.  "That's a long time to be depressed."  Akane thought back to the conversation she  had with Cologne.  "I wonder what that  was all about."</p><p>Akane continued to think on the subject,  perplexed.  Suddenly an idea hit her.</p><p>"Cologne wanted Ranma and I to help Shampoo.  That's why she told me about her depression  and Mousse's supposed plan.  I better go  talk to those two."</p><p>Akane arrived at the vacant lot.  Ranma was wiping her head with a towel.</p><p>"Hey Ranma!   Where did Mousse go?"</p><p>"Oh…hey Akane.   He said he had somthin' to do."   Ranma said, taking a small water break.   It was a pretty hot day.</p><p>"Well I just talked to Cologne."</p><p>"So…what did she say?"  Ranma asked, looking up to the sky.  Clouds were covering the sky quickly.  At least they would cover the sun for a while.</p><p>"Well…I think she wants our help, but she didn't  come out right and say it."</p><p>"What'cha talkin' about Akane?"</p><p>"Well, she told me that Shampoo has been depressed  or something since the day after the duel.   They are going back to China in a week."</p><p>"What?  Why  are they doin' that?  I didn't think  they could return to their Amazon tribe."</p><p>"I think Cologne knows something we don't.  She told me that our training Mousse  wouldn't help because the rule that whoever beats you, you have to marry, only  works on outsiders."</p><p>"Dang…that's right.   So what are we doin' wastin' our time like this.  I told you we shoulda stayed outta this!"</p><p>"Will you listen for just a minute Ranma before  blaming me!"  Akane said loudly.  The wind was starting to pick up a bit and  the sky grew darker.  A storm was  coming.</p><p>"I…I'm not blaming you!  I just said at the beginnin'…"</p><p>"Whatever Ranma, save it!  Cologne told me that she thinks she knows what Mousse is gonna  do.  She said he would risk his future  for one last fight against Shampoo."</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane, confused.</p><p>"So what should we do Akane?  If we are just wasin' our time…"</p><p>"Ranma…I think we should keep training Mousse.  I have no idea what is going on but  apparently everyone else does."</p><p>"Wait a second…if Mousse is from the same tribe,  shouldn't he have known that our plan wasn't gonna work?"</p><p>"I don't know…maybe our plan for him to beat Shampoo  would work.  That would explain why he  accepted our help."</p><p>Akane felt a cold drop in her arm.  She looked up in the sky.  The sky was dark gray and a few rumbles  could be heard in the distance.</p><p>"I think it's gonna rain."  Ranma said.</p><p>"Yea…we better finish planning at the Dojo."  Akane said, walking off.</p><p>"Hey…wait a sec Akane…what's the rush.  It's not like I'm not female already."</p><p>"Well Ranma…If I know you. You don't quite have on  the proper clothing to be walking around during a big rain shower, if you know  what I mean."  Akane said, turning  around and smiling.</p><p>"What are you talkin' about Akane?"  Ranma asked, running up next to her.</p><p>Akane indicated to her shirt.</p><p>"Oh…well what did you expect me to do?  Put one on in advance?  You know I don't wear that stuff if I don't  have to."</p><p>"No Ranma…I was jus saying you should be  prepared.  If it started raining and  your shirt got soaked…"</p><p>"Well you're one to talk."  Ranma said, pointing out Akane's short red skirt.  "If we get enough wind form this storm that  thing looks like it would fly right off.   Not to mention what would happen if <i>it</i> got soaked."</p><p>"Yea…you would just love for that to happen wouldn't  you Ranma?"</p><p>"<i>What</i>?   You gotta be kiddin!"  Ranma said  defensively.  "Why would anyone want to  see that?"</p><p>"Well I don't know Ranma…you were the one that  brought it up."  Akane said with a sly smile.</p><p>"<i>Please</i> Akane.  If I wanted to see someone cute I would look at myself."</p><p>"Sure…whatever Ranma."  Akane said, walking ahead of her.</p><p>"Well besides…I told you those blue panties don't  suit you too good."</p><p>"<i>What</i>?   You <i>were</i> looking at me weren't you?"  Akane said, stopping and angrily staring at Ranma.</p><p>Ranma backed up instinctively.  "Well…it's not like it was <i>my</i>  fault.  You were the one walking in  front of me just then.  The wind picked  up and…" Ranma suddenly realized he was only making the hole bigger.</p><p>Akane approached Ranma angrily.</p><p>"H…hey…wait a sec Akane…I…uh…"</p><p>"Ranma you really are a pervert!"  Akane yelled at him.</p><p>"Hey…why are you yellin' at me for looking at <i>your</i>  fashion mistake?"</p><p>"Ranma you idiot.   You shouldn't have looked.   Besides, it's unlady like."</p><p>"Hey…I dunno who you are callin' a lady.  I'm still a guy under here."</p><p>"Whatever Ranma…just…"</p><p>Suddenly, a giant flash of lightning illuminated the  street.  Ranma and Akane halted their  argument for just a second, looking around wide-eyed.  A tremendous crash of thunder followed.  Akane, stricken, jumped to Ranma, grabbing her arm tightly.  A downpour ensued, quickly filling the  street with water.</p><p>Ranma turned to Akane; Ranma could feel her heart  beating quickly. "We better find shelter Akane.  I didn't think it would be this bad."  Ranma said, looking around.   She spied Uc-Chan's Okonomiyaki grill.   She raced to the small shop, Akane trailing behind her.</p><p>Ranma and Akane burst into Uc-Chan's soaking wet.</p><p>"Well hello you two!''  Ukyo said happily.</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath.  That thunder had worked her heart up too.  She looked to Akane; she was soaked from  head to toe.</p><p>"Hey Akane…"</p><p>"Sorry Ranma…it just kinda scared me a bit…"</p><p>Ranma looked at her.  "Yea it kinda surprised me too…" Ranma said, a bit embarrassed  that she had let her guard down.   "Well…at least Uc-Chan's was near by.   We could get…"</p><p>Ranma's eyes moved down Akane's form.  She found herself staring at her  figure.  She started to blush, turning  around quickly.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…what's wrong?"  Akane asked innocently.   She was wiping the water off her face, her hair dripping wet.</p><p>Ukyo approached Akane.  "Um sugar…"</p><p>Akane looked to Ukyo.  She was pointing at her shirt.   Akane looked down. She had a white shirt and was soaking wet from that  sudden rain.  Akane blushed heavily,  placing her arms around her chest.</p><p>"Just tell me when it's ok."  Ranma said, continuing to face away from  Akane.</p><p>"Hey don't worry Akane.  I have some spare clothes for ya."  Ukyo said, leading her into the back.</p><p>"Th…thanks Ukyo."   Akane said quietly.</p><p>The two emerged after a few minutes.  Akane was wearing a suit similar to the one  Ukyo had on.  Long blue pants and that  blue shirt.  Akane was still blushing a  bit.</p><p>"And for our other female here…" Ukyo said, placing  a teakettle next to Ranma.</p><p>"Thanks Uc-Chan" Ranma said, pouring the warm water  over himself.  The warm water felt a lot  better than that cold rainwater.</p><p>The three sat at the chairs next to the grill.  Ranma and Akane were still wet and the storm  did not show any signs of letting up.</p><p>Ukyo smiled at the couple.</p><p>"Thanks for the help Ukyo."  Akane said sheepishly, she looked toward  Ranma.  Ranma turned and looked at  her.  Abruptly, Ranma switched his gaze  elsewhere, fearing the wrath of Akane.</p><p>"No problem sugar.   Any progress with Mousse and Shampoo?"</p><p>"No…not as of yet."   Akane said, regaining her usual demeanor.  "I went to talk to Cologne.   They are moving in a week"</p><p>Ukyo was stunned.   "W…what?"</p><p>"Yea Ukyo…Cologne said that Shampoo was depressed.  Ranma and I were planning on what to do when  that storm hit us suddenly."</p><p>"Any ideas?"</p><p>"Well…I told Ranma that we should keep training  Mousse.  Cologne knows something about  him we don't."</p><p>"That Cologne…did she say she <i>wanted</i> your  help?"</p><p>"No…not outright.   I think she wants it though.  You  have to admit, its kinda hard asking the person who stole your son-in-law from  you for help."</p><p>"Yea…I guess you're right…"</p><p>Another tremendous crash of thunder shook the little  shop.  The lights blinked a bit before  going out completely.</p><p>Ukyo looked to her grill, frustrated.  Ranma got up and took a peek outside.</p><p>"Looks like power is out all over town.  That rain is still comin' down pretty  hard."  Ranma said, returning to his  seat.</p><p>Ukyo started to the back towards the kitchen, to  inspect the fuses.  Ranma and Akane sat  next to the cooling grill silently.</p><p>Ukyo returned after a few minutes, sitting with the  couple.  The three were thinking hard on  the subject at hand.  The storm  continued outside, announcing its presence with bright flashes and crashing  thunder.</p><p>Ranma looked around at Akane and Ukyo.  They were pretty serious.</p><p>"Hey…why are you guys all serious and stuff?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Well…we  have to think of something for Mousse.   He only has a week left."<br/>"So? What if he only has one week?"</p><p>"Ranma!"   Akane scolded.  "Why are you so  cold when it comes to Mousse?"</p><p>"Geeze Akane…stop being all un-cute and stuff.  If Cologne and Shampoo are gonna move  there's nothin' we can do about it."</p><p>"There must be something we can do…"</p><p>"Why not see if Cologne will stay here until you're  finished with Mousse?"  Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Nah.  I  don't think that would work."  Ranma  started.  "Those two prolly wanna go  back to China.  Besides, I doubt they  would stay and wait for Mousse.  No  tellin' how long it would take to train him."</p><p>"I guess we have no choice but to hope Mousse can  win" Akane said.</p><p>"Well…look on the bright side.  Akane only had a week to prepare for her  match against Shampoo and she did fine."   Ukyo offered, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>"I don't think Mousse has enough skill to do what  Akane did."  Ranma said.</p><p>A sharp crack came from outside.  Suddenly machines started whirring and signs  started buzzing.</p><p>"Oh good!   The power is back on.  You guys  hungry?"  Ukyo said, smiling.</p><p>Ranma and Akane nodded.</p><p>The couple sat there eating.  Ukyo was helping other customers.  Ranma looked outside.  The sun had broke through the veil of  darkness and the rain had slowed to just a drizzle.</p><p>"Hey Akane, you ready to go?  The storm outside has stopped."</p><p>"Sure Ranma."   Akane said, rising.  "See ya  Ukyo."  She called to her.</p><p>Ukyo waved to the two as they left.</p><p>"Man…" Ranma started, "This plotting stuff is kinda  hard."</p><p>"Yea you're right about that."  Akane said</p><p>The sun coming out made the area very humid.  Ukyo's long pants and shirt made Akane feel  a bit uncomfortable.  The two continued  to the Dojo, the fresh smell of the rain gently floated through the air.</p><p>"I wonder it if was as hard to plot against us as it  is for us to plot <i>for</i> someone."   Ranma said thoughtfully.</p><p>"I dunno Ranma.   They say it is always easier to destroy than create."</p><p>"Yea…I guess you're right."  Ranma returned.  "Hey…what if Mousse does win and Shampoo still hates him?"</p><p>"Well…Cologne told me she thinks that Shampoo does  have feelings for Mousse."</p><p>"So she really does like Mousse?"</p><p>"It's kinda hard to say…I think its something like  repressed feelings or something."</p><p>"So it's like she can't tell him how she feels?"</p><p>"Kinda I guess…I really don't know.  I just hope <i>we</i> know what we're  doing."</p><p>"Yea…me too…"</p><p>The couple continued to the Dojo, wondering if they  were doing the right thing.  When it  came to romance they really weren't experts in the field.</p><p>The next day arrived.  Ranma and Akane were again walking to the field to help Mousse.</p><p>"Hey Mousse…did you hear about Cologne and  Shampoo?"  Akane started.</p><p>"Yes I have.   I already issued my challenge.   Shampoo has agreed to one final fight."</p><p>"Can you win with so little time left?"</p><p>"I don't have much of a choice.  I must win!"  Mousse said with that fiery tone of his</p><p>The three continued to the vacant lot.</p><p>Ranma, now female, spoke up. "Hey Mousse…what are  you plannin'?"</p><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><p>"Well…about all those Amazonian rules.  The rule that whoever beats you, you have to  marry only works on outsiders."</p><p>"Yes I know."</p><p>"So…you are in the same tribe as Shampoo aren't  you?"</p><p>"Trust me Saotome.   I have a plan.  In two days you  will find out."</p><p>Ranma and Akane turned to Mousse.</p><p>"Two days?"   They asked, a bit stunned.</p><p>Mousse nodded, his hands in his sleeves.</p><p>"But there is no way you'll be ready by then…"</p><p>"I have to be…"</p><p>"This is just great…you don't stand a chance against  Shampoo.  You can barely even manage to  hit Akane, let alone Shampoo."</p><p>"Still…I must try.   I would do anything."</p><p>"Well…your funeral." Ranma said, arriving at the  vacant lot.</p><p>Akane sat under her tree.  She was wearing her shorts, having learned from her mistake  yesterday.  Mousse's voice echoed  through her mind.</p><p>"I have to be…"</p><p>"Mousse is deathly serious about this.  There's only one thing we can do and that is  hope that Ranma's training has paid off…" Akane continued to watch the spar;  she got a very bad feeling all of a sudden.   She shook it off, trusting that Ranma would come through.</p><p><u>All or  Nothing</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane watched as Mousse walked off into  the night.  That session had lasted all  day.  Ranma and Akane took turns helping  Mousse.  Everyone was tired.</p><p>"Two days left Ranma…"</p><p>"Yea…"</p><p>"Think Mousse will come back to train a bit more?"</p><p>"I doubt it.   He said somethin' about this being the last session."</p><p>Akane shrugged and started back to the Dojo, Ranma  walked beside her, her hands were behind her head.</p><p>The couple just relaxed for the remaining two  days.  Neither one really trained all  that much, if at all. They Finally went to Uc-Chan's with those gift  certificates that Ukyo had given them.   Ukyo agreed to come with them to the match.  She would be the cook of honor.</p><p>Ranma, Ukyo and Akane went to the schoolyard of  Furinkan High.  It was a popular place  to fight, what with the large amount of open space and ground that was  relatively free from debris.</p><p>Akane looked around at the field.  She could recall the pain she went through  at the hands of Shampoo and wondered if Mousse even stood a chance.  Cologne came over and sat next to the  three.  That made Ranma a bit  uncomfortable.</p><p>Shampoo and Mousse entered the field.  Shampoo was wearing the same loose clothes  she had when she fought Akane.  Mousse  had on his massive robes.  Who knew what  he was hiding.</p><p>Mousse stood there, facing Shampoo.  He started to chuckle a bit, a smile drawing  itself across his face.  He began to  speak a very strange language.  Shampoo  did not look surprised.</p><p>Everyone turned to Cologne expecting an  explanation.  Cologne nodded to herself.</p><p>"I knew that is what he had planned…" she said to no  one in particular.</p><p>"What?"   Akane asked hurriedly.</p><p>"Mousse is giving up his place in the Amazon tribe."</p><p>"So…what would that do for him?"  Ranma asked</p><p>"He is an outsider now.  If he were to enter the tribe after today, he would be killed on  the spot."</p><p>Everyone's eyes widened.  "So that means that if he beats Shampoo…"</p><p>Cologne nodded.</p><p>"Mousse…you stupid!   You no can beat Shampoo!"   Shampoo yelled to him.   "Besides…even if you win, Shampoo never like you!"</p><p>Mousse finished his little speech and stood there  calmly.  Shampoo took her stance.  The wind picked up a bit…blowing a bit of  sand around.  Everyone looked on; the  tension was high.  Mousse had to win…or  give up Shampoo forever.</p><p>All of a sudden, Mousse shot out a volley of chains  and blades towards Shampoo.  Shampoo  leapt into the air, dodging them easily.   The fight was on.</p><p>Mousse turned his head to the sky.  Shampoo was coming down with a kick.  Mousse unsheathed his hidden forearm  blades.  He held one up, absorbing the  full force of Shampoo's kick.  Mousse  slid back a few feet.  Shampoo charged  him.  Mousse stood his ground, blocking  with the blades.  Shampoo attacked him  fiercely, sending blow after blow to him.   She reared back, launching a powerful roundhouse to Mousse's head.  Mousse tilted his head out of the way,  putting the blade in its place.   Shampoo's leg went clean through the blade, shattering it.  The bits of metal fell to the ground, making  little <i>clanking</i> noises.  She  launched another powerful kick.   Mousse  desperately held up his last blade.  It  too was shattered on impact.  Mousse was  sent reeling.  Shampoo closed in,  placing a foot in his stomach.  Mousse  was sent flying backwards.  He landed on  his back and threw his legs over his head, flipping to meet the angry  Shampoo.  Shampoo launched a punch at  Mousse.  He bent backwards, wrapping his  feet around Shampoo's ankles, taking her to the ground with him. He grabbed her  by the arm and sent her flying with a mighty heave.  Shampoo hit the ground hard, but managed to spring to her feet  and charge again.  Mousse resumed his  standing position; his back was facing Shampoo.  He spun around quickly, lashing out with a series of daggers.  Shampoo leapt over them.  Mousse narrowed his eyes.</p><p>Everyone watched on, stunned at the fight.</p><p>"Hey Ran-Chan…things seem to be pretty even  huh?"  Ukyo asked, handing him an  Okonomiyaki.</p><p>Ranma nodded, his mouth was full at that point in  time.</p><p>Mousse eyed Shampoo, seeming to float in the  air.  He launched a series of chains  towards Shampoo.  One of them wrapped  around Shampoo's leg and another wrapped around her waist.  Mousse pulled his chains, sending Shampoo  over him, soaring into the ground.</p><p>Shampoo's eyes widened at the sight of the incoming  ground.  She flipped to her feet,  landing hard on them.  She whirled  around to Mousse, still holding the chains.   She now yanked them upward, sending Mousse into the sky.  Mousse landed on his back hard, the fall  pushing all the air out of his lungs.  A  small dust cloud arose from his position.   He regained his breath and looked at Shampoo.  She was on the offensive again.</p><p>Shampoo approached Mousse, lifting up her foot in an  effort to finish this duel.  She thrust  her foot downward towards his head.   Mousse rolled, jumping to his feet and launching a few more  daggers.  She threw up her forearms,  having been caught off guard.  The  daggers grazed her skin, leaving several small bloody trails in her arms.</p><p>Shampoo ignored the cuts and charged Mousse,  planting a solid blow to his face, Mousse was sent reeling again.  Shampoo closed with a kick to his midsection  and then launched a roundhouse, catching Mousse on the jaw.  Mousse fell to the ground in pain.</p><p>Ranma shook his head.  "Man…Shampoo really doesn't want Mousse to win.  Even I would have felt that attack."</p><p>"Yea you're not kidding Ran-Chan"</p><p>Akane just turned to Cologne.  She seemed to be indifferent, like she knew  what was going to happen.</p><p>Shampoo shot her fist down to Mousse.  Mousse flipped out of the way, catching  Shampoo with his foot.  Shampoo took a  few steps back and Mousse sprung to his feet.</p><p>"You never win Mousse!  Your plan not going to work!"   Shampoo shouted.</p><p>Mousse just chuckled to himself.  He dashed to Shampoo with a series of high  kicks.  Shampoo threw up her arms,  blocking the blows.  Mousse suddenly  shot his foot towards Shampoo's feet, tripping her and making her fall on the  ground.  He attempted to step on her,  but she rolled out of the way.  She  planted her hands and sprung into the air.   Mousse leapt after her.  They  exchanged blows before landing.  Mousse  landed on his knees, holding his stomach.   Shampoo landed on her feet, but her side was stinging.  She rubbed her side and brought her hand to  her face.  She had been cut by  something.  It wasn't deep but it was  bleeding quite a bit.</p><p>"Wow…I didn't know Mousse would be so cruel to the  one he loved."  Akane said, shocked at  the sight.</p><p>"No Akane…his plan is pretty good.  If Shampoo loses a lot of blood, she would  just collapse, at any rate, the blood she did lose would weaken her a  bit."  Ranma returned.</p><p>"Yea Akane, besides, that isn't a very vital  spot."  Ukyo offered.</p><p>Akane nodded, going back to the fight.</p><p>"Mousse!  How  dare you!  Shampoo end this right  now!"  She yelled, holding up her right  hand.</p><p>"<i>Kyousan no Onigami</i>!"</p><p>Shampoo shot her fist into the ground, making giant  pillars of rock jut out from the sand.</p><p>Mousse back flipped from one spike.  Another one was in his path.  He launched a dagger to the rock, splitting  it in two.  That allowed him to leap  backwards, avoiding another spike.  He  landed, having endured the attack.   Suddenly, a tremendous force hit him from behind.  A spike had appeared from behind, sending  him to the ground.  Shampoo wasn't  finished.  Mousse felt the ground  trembling beneath him.  Quickly he leapt  into the air, oblivious to what Shampoo was doing.</p><p>Shampoo had gathered a few daggers and, having  successfully launched Mousse into the air, unleashed them towards Mousse.  Mousse looked down at the daggers streaming  towards him.  He shot out his own,  knocking them out the sky.  Suddenly,  Mousse felt a light pressure on his forehead and lost sight of Shampoo.  Everything was blurry.  Mousse landed on his feet, looking around in  confusion.  Shampoo had hit the bridge  of his glasses with her dagger; breaking them and making them fall to the  ground.</p><p>Ranma just sat there in disgust.  "Man…we forgot to fix that problem.  It's as good as over now."  Akane and Ukyo looked on, worried for  Mousse.</p><p>Mousse turned to a near by shrub.  "Shampoo.   You cannot defeat me that easily.   Look at this!"  Mousse said,  triumphantly holding up a pair of glasses in the air.  He heard a little crack as the glasses were ripped from his hands  by some unknown force.  Shampoo had  again broken the glasses with one of Mousse's daggers.  Mousse turned to another bush.  "That will not work Shampoo."  He said, putting on yet another pair of  glasses.  It was then he noticed he was  looking at a bush.  He turned to Shampoo  who was furious.</p><p>"I'll bet that's what Mousse did that day he left  early" Akane exclaimed.  "He must have  got a few more pairs of glasses!"</p><p>"Who knew that guy was so serious…" Ranma said</p><p>"Love is serious business Ranma."  Akane returned sharply.</p><p>"Feh…like you know anythin' about love Akane!"</p><p>"I know true love when I see it!"</p><p>"Yea right…you wouldn't know love if…"</p><p>"Hey guys…come on now.  You're missing the fight."   Ukyo said, interrupting the two.</p><p>Ranma and Akane shot glances at each other before  going back to the fight.</p><p>"I still know more about love than you do,  Ranma."  Akane said coldly.</p><p>"No you don't…you are too violent…"</p><p>"Guys…come on!   Mousse needs your support."  Ukyo  said.</p><p>"Ok…sorry Uc-Chan…it just amazes me that such a  violent tomboy would claim to know about love."</p><p>"What!  How  dare you Ranma!"  Akane said,  rising.  "If you weren't such an idiot…"</p><p>Ranma rose to his feet.  "Hey…wait a sec…who you callin' an idiot?  You're the one that got us involved in  this.  I said no…but you had to butt  in!"</p><p>"No Ranma, none of that matters…you <i>are</i> a  complete idiot…How come it took so long for you to realize your true feelings!"</p><p>Ranma scoffed.   "Ha!  I didn't exactly see you  following your feelings back then!"</p><p>"Well <i>Ranma</i>…at least I was the first one to  say it!"</p><p>"No you weren't!"</p><p>"Oh…so you <i>did</i> tell me you loved me back in  China did you?"</p><p>"N…no…I was just sayin'…"</p><p>"Oh…ok I get it…so you lied to me back then…is that  what it is Ranma?  I told you I heard  you say "Akane! I love you more than anything!"  But you had to say you didn't!"</p><p>"Y…you big idiot!   Where in the world did you get that?   I didn't say anythin' like that!"</p><p>"Oh come on…admit it. You did love me then."</p><p>"Well…maybe I did…but if you weren't such a macho  chick it would have been easier to tell ya'.   Besides…you must have felt the same way.  I didn't exactly see you on you knees proclaimin' your love of  me!"</p><p>Ukyo looked up at the two going at it.  That made two fights to watch.  Well…at least this latest one was about true  love and not who stole who's fiancée.   Ukyo shook her head and returned to the duel, still halfway listening to  Ranma and Akane.</p><p>Shampoo and Mousse, oblivious to Ranma and Akane's  latest argument, kept fighting.  Shampoo  was having trouble making progress, a fact that made her very angry.</p><p>Shampoo sent Mousse backwards with a solid kick.</p><p>"Shampoo tired of you Mousse!  All you ever do is annoy Shampoo!  Shampoo put end to Mousse's troubles once  and for all!"</p><p>"<i>Shinzenbi Neko Ken</i>!"</p><p>"Well if it wasn't for me saying it first, you would  have <i>never</i> had the courage to say it" Akane countered.  "I guess <i>I</i> was the strongest one here  huh Ranma?"</p><p>"Yea right…you only did that because you were <i>so</i>  jealous that Shampoo might have actually married me!"</p><p>"Ranma…sometimes I could just…" Akane looked at  Ranma, his focus was on the field.  The  anger in Akane's eyes faded quickly as she turned to the fight, hearing Shampoo  announce her ultimate technique: the true Cat Fist.</p><p>"Oh Damn…" Ranma uttered.</p><p>"Poor Mousse…it's over for him…" Akane said sadly.</p><p>Ukyo turned to Cologne.  She did not look the least bit worried.  Ukyo heard Mousse scream.   She whipped her head round, seeing Mousse recovering from Shampoo's  first attack.</p><p>Mousse struggled to get up, that blow had nearly  ended the fight.  Shampoo charged again,  swift as lightning.  She lashed out at  Mousse, leaving a bloody trail across his face.  Mousse was sent back.   Shampoo charged again.  Mousse  leapt over her, launching a spiked chain towards her.  Shampoo batted the chain away much like a cat does a stuffed  toy.  She leapt on Mousse, tearing away  at him.  Mousse managed to clamber away.  He stood, launching a volley of daggers at Shampoo.  Shampoo cleared them easily.   Mousse leapt to meet Shampoo in the air with a kick.  Instead, he found himself on the receiving  end of a sharp blow that sent him straight to the ground.  He landed hard, the air needing time to  refill his lungs.  Shampoo landed with a  foot on his chest.  Mousse gasped for  air while she leapt off of Mousse's form, lying there on the ground.</p><p>Mousse struggled to get to his feet.</p><p>"I will not give up Shampoo!"  Mousse shouted.  His assertions fell upon deaf ears.  Shampoo seemed to teleport next to him, planting a fist in his  stomach.  The force sent him  upwards.  Shampoo launched a massive  roundhouse, catching Mousse in the lower jaw.   The blow cut straight to the bone, sending a few drops of blood  flying.  Shampoo finished her onslaught  with a well-placed punch to the ribs that effectively put Mousse on his back.</p><p>Shampoo stood over Mousse, who was struggling to get  up.  She shook her head slightly, as if  shaking a thought out of her mind.  That  violent look of rage that Akane was so familiar with left her eyes.</p><p>"Is…it over?"   She asked Cologne.</p><p>"No Akane…Mousse will not give up until he wins or  passes out."</p><p>Akane nodded.</p><p>Mousse looked up, his eyes pleading with  Shampoo.</p><p>"Shampoo…I have always loved you.  Why can't you see that?  Why do you hate me so?"</p><p>"Because Mousse is a big stupid!  Shampoo will never ever like you!"  She yelled, kicking him in the face.</p><p>Ukyo covered her eyes at that sight.</p><p>"Geeze…Shampoo really hates Mousse doesn't  she?"  Ranma asked Cologne.  She did not respond: her entire focus was on  what was happening.</p><p>Shampoo eyed Mousse, lying there on the ground.  He was getting up.  Shampoo kneed him in the stomach.  Mousse caved inward.   Shampoo planted an elbow to the Mousse's back, sending him face first in  the ground.</p><p>Mousse struggled to raise his head to Shampoo.  "I love you Shampoo!"  He called out to her.</p><p>Shampoo stood there, her arms crossed angrily.  Suddenly, she noticed something in Mousse's  face.  A tear.  That look of rage vanished in her eyes.  She moved a bit closer to Mousse.</p><p>"Why…why Mousse crying?" she asked, seemingly  concerned</p><p>Mousse did not respond.</p><p>"Mousse…love Shampoo that much?"</p><p>"Yes!"  He  managed.</p><p>"Then why you make Shampoo beat you like that.  What about how Shampoo feel about Mousse!"</p><p>"It was the only way…"</p><p>"No…Shampoo not want to hurt Mousse…but Mousse such  a big stupid that you left Shampoo no choice!"</p><p>"I love you Shampoo!"</p><p>"Then why you no act like it?  You try to kill Shampoo's true love Ranma!"</p><p>"I thought if I got rid of Ranma…I could finally…"</p><p>"No Mousse.   It not work that way!  Shampoo  finish this fight right now!"  She  yelled, raising her foot, preparing to strike out against Mousse.</p><p>"But Shampoo…I love you more than anything…"</p><p>Shampoo was hesitating.  Everyone looked in awe.</p><p>"You…really serious about you love me?"  Shampoo asked, she was no longer angry, but  maybe felt a little sorry for Mousse.</p><p>Mousse managed a weak nod.  Shampoo looked down at the pitiful sight, trying to continue the  fight.  She did feel sorry for Mousse.</p><p>"If you love shampoo that much…maybe shampoo could  forgive…Shampoo could never forgive person like Mousse!"  She said, hurt.  Ranma eyed Shampoo closely.   A tear had squeezed out of her eye.   He turned to Cologne.</p><p>Shampoo turned around and left, seeming to leave a  part of herself in that field. Mousse just lay in the field, not willing to  move.  A few more tears came out of  Shampoo's eyes; she did not try to hide them.</p><p>Akane turned to Cologne.  "Why…can't she forgive Mousse?"</p><p>"Amazon culture is harsh Akane.''  Cologne said simply.  She offered them a smile.  "Thank you all for your help."  She said, leaping off to catch up with  Shampoo.</p><p>Ranma looked at Cologne, heading to a hurt Shampoo:  and Mousse, almost knocked out in the field.</p><p>He turned to Akane, dumbfounded.  "So…what just happened?"</p><p>Akane and Ukyo were equally confused.</p><p>"I dunno Ran-Chan" Ukyo said, shaking her head.</p><p>"Did we do it?"   Akane asked, almost in a whisper.</p><p>The three looked at each other, looks of confusion  abounded.</p><p>Silence passed for e few moments.</p><p>"Geeze…" Ranma finally said, annoyed.  "All that work and we get nothin'.  I told ya we shouldn't have interfered  Akane."</p><p>"Maybe you're right Ranma…" Akane said, watching  Mousse limp off the field quietly.   "Mousse might have lost Shampoo forever just then…" She panned across  the field, all sorts of daggers and such litter the field, along with a few  patched of red.</p><p>"Well…anyone up for some Okonomiyaki?"  Ukyo asked, giving up on trying to figure  out what had just happened.</p><p>"Yea…I guess we've done all we can."  Akane said.</p><p>The three went to Uc-Chan's shop, feasting on  Okonomiyaki.  They were pretty quiet  during the whole meal, wondering if Mousse would win Shampoo's heart after  all.  Slowly, Ranma and Akane made their  way to the Dojo.</p><p><u>Questions…</u></p><p>Ryoga was lying in his tent, having successfully got  himself lost again.  He turned to his  cooking dinner, his mind weighed heavy on his heart.  It happened so long ago.   So why couldn't he get the visions out of his head?  Visions of his bloody hand…Akane lying  there, lifeless in Ranma's Arms.  Her  fighting Shampoo tooth and nail for Ranma.</p><p>He brought his chopsticks to his mouth.  Suddenly, something hit him, almost  physically knocking him down.  He  dropped his Chopsticks.</p><p>"A…Akane…something is wrong!" He whispered to himself.  With that, he ate his food and hurriedly  disassembled his camp.</p><p>"I have to see Akane again!"  He said to himself, starting off to who  knows where.  Hopefully he would get to  the Tendou Dojo within a week or so.</p><p>*****Ha! Three in a row this week. So. Hope you  liked it. Kind of a not ending…. Don't worry. I know what happens. Um…that  really doesn't help you guys, does it? Well…I'm not gonna spoil it. I wouldn't  get reviews that way. hehe. So. Nothing much. I like cliffhangers, don't you?  Well, I like typing them. Reading them is fine too…</p><p>Ugh…too sleepy to even type straight. Oh. And just a  little fun thing I did. I have a live journal now. My user name is Elidibus at  . I'm too lazy to grab the link and post it. But if you ever  wanted to know what happens to me on a daily basis, why not give it a look. I  figured it would be fun, and it is, actually! So Until Next We Meet*****</p>
