</div><p>Chapter Seven</p><p><u>The  Aftermath</u></p><p>Akane awoke in her bed.  She opened her eyes slowly.   Her whole body was sore and her nose hurt pretty bad.  She turned her head and looked out her  window.  The sun was in full view.  How long was she sleeping?  She turned to her alarm clock.  11:36 AM it said.  She let her head fall back into her pillow.  "Man…what happened back there?" she asked  herself.  She finally remembered what  happened yesterday.  "Wow…I had no idea  I could do all that…" She took a deep breath, trying to forget her pain.</p><p>She suddenly remembered something else.  "Oh…I <i>kissed</i> Ranma!  How could I let myself do that, especially  in front of everyone?" She thought for a minute.  She did enjoy that kiss, the parts she could remember any way.</p><p>Her door opened.   Kasumi slowly entered.  "Oh, Good  afternoon Akane!" she said with a big smile.   "I'm so glad you're awake now.  I  brought some lunch for you, incase you were hungry."</p><p>"Thanks Kasumi."   Akane managed.  She struggled to  sit up straight.  Kasumi brought her a  small table and placed it on her bed.   She lay her food on the table, smiling.   "You know Akane, that was a really great job you did.  Everyone is so proud of you."</p><p>"Well, thanks Kasumi, I was just helping Ranma is  all.  Shampoo was quite a tough customer."</p><p>"Well, I'll go tell everyone you are up, no doubt  they are all eager to visit you."   Kasumi left Akane's room, going down stairs.</p><p>Akane sat in her bed, trying not to move so  much.  She looked to her plate.  Soba noodles for lunch today.  She was not hungry right now. She brought  her hand up to her face, looking at her ring.   It sparkled in the sunlight.  She  smiled to herself.  She really had beat  Shampoo.  With that threat gone,  everything else would be easy.</p><p>Akane looked up to her door.  Ranma was leaning against it, hands in his  pockets.  "Ranma!" Akane gasped.  She started to blush.</p><p>Ranma turned his head to her and smiled.  "I knew you would win Akane.  Things did look kind of bad for you out  there though; you sure gave everyone a scare."</p><p>Akane smiled shyly.   "Well, I decided to focus in on my training.  Seeing all your moves made me think that I should start learning  some too.  If we are to carry on the  dojo, I guess I should be at least a match for you."  Akane paused a second, nervously.  She had done it again…Well…there was no use trying to hide it any  more.</p><p>"Yea, speaking of <i>my</i> moves, what was all that  back there?  How come you didn't tell me  you wanted to learn the <i>Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken?"</i></p><p>Akane's face got a bit worried.  "Well Ranma…I wanted to do this by my  self.  I had to prove to everyone that I  could fight my own battles.  I'm not as  weak as everyone thinks."</p><p>"Well I just dropped by to tell you that you did a  great job.  Thanks for fightin' for  me."  Ranma smiled.</p><p>"Well, it wasn't <i>just</i> for you, I kinda wanted  to fight Shampoo for a long time now.   She would piss me off so bad."   Akane paused a second.  "Hey  Ranma?  You <i>knew</i> that I was going  to win that duel?"</p><p>Ranma stood up straight.  "Yea Akane, You are too jealous to have let the fight go any  other way."  Ranma smiled and walked  out.</p><p>"Ranma!  Come  back here!  What you mean I was too  jealous?  Ranma!  I wasn't jealous over Shampoo!  You are <i>such</i> an idiot!"  Akane called to Ranma.  Ranma did not return.  She sat in her room, fuming.  "That Ranma…he always has to be such a  kidder doesn't he?"  She straightened  out her plate and started eating.  The  food was wonderful.</p><p>Ranma walked down stairs, just seeming to kill a bit  of time.  Kasumi was hanging the  laundry.  Soun and Genma were playing a  game of GO.  Nabiki was lying on her  stomach, facing the TV.  She had her  abacus in her hands and a few papers lie beside her.  Ranma quietly walked over to the papers.  His name was on one of them.  He got a worried look, sitting down next to  them and watching some TV.</p><p>Ranma leaned back.   "Well, it's over…Shampoo was the hardest one to get rid of.  All that leaves are some "annoyances".  I hope she will be ok.  I do kinda feel sorry for her."  Something shot up from inside Ranma.  It didn't feel good at all.  It was fear.  "With nothing else in our way…I guess that means that the wedding  is on.  It could go on in a matter of  days…" Ranma leaned back, looking at the ceiling.  "I guess I'm kinda scared to go through with it…maybe we should wait  until we get out of school."  He trailed  off his thoughts for a few minutes.  "I  guess I shouldn't worry about it.  Maybe  I'll just sit back and enjoy the ride…Of course one day I would have to…nah I  don't wanna think about that right now.   I might scare myself."</p><p>Ranma closed his eyes for a second.  He opened them.  Nabiki sat there, smiling close to his face  "Hey Ranma, congrats on your new fiancée.  Well, <i>old</i> fiancée as it were."  Nabiki noticed that Ranma had a concerned  look on his face.  "What's with the long  face Ranma.  I would think you would be  thrilled to death to have finally won Akane back."</p><p>"Oh…well it's nothing Nabiki, I was just starting to  worry…about Shampoo."  Ranma  recovered.  "Yea…she was prolly trying  to kill herself or coming up with another law or something to call herself my  fiancée."</p><p>"Well, Ranma, take it easy.  Akane would want you too.  Any plans on the future?"</p><p>Ranma sat up.   "Uh…no not yet…I guess I'll just sit back and watch everything fall into  place.  Besides, me and Akane are in  school right now."</p><p>"Well, Ranma, you're the man in this  relationship.  You'll have to go through  with this one way or another."</p><p>"Yea, I know…"</p><p>"So what are you gonna do about it?"</p><p>"I already told you…I guess I'll just wait until me  and Akane get out of school.  I'll go  from there."</p><p>"Suit yourself Ranma.  Oh, by the way, I still haven't forgotten about our little photo  shoot.  Is tomorrow after school good  for you?"</p><p>"No…how about we wait until next year?"</p><p>Nabiki smiled.   "Tomorrow it is then!"</p><p>Ranma continued to watch TV.  His mind went back to Akane.  "I wonder what she is thinking right  now?  Well I sure hope she will be better  by tomorrow, we have a lot of work to make up at school.  Not that I actually wanted to go, but pops  would force me."</p><p>A few hours passed, Kasumi called for dinner.  Everyone sat at the table.  The stairs creaked a bit, announcing Akane's  presence.  She stiffly walked to the  table, sitting down next to Ranma.   Ranma turned to her, noting the cuts that were all over her body.  Akane noticed that Ranma looked a bit  worried for her.  "Oh, don't worry  Ranma, cuts on the face heal faster than any place on the body.  I'll go visit Tofu-sensei and see what he  can do tomorrow."</p><p>Kasumi passed the plates out.  Akane reached for a pork bun.  Kasumi noticed something sparkling in the  light.  "Oh!  Akane!  What is that?"  Kasumi asked, grabbing her hand.  Akane started to blush heavily as Ranma did.</p><p>"Oh My…it's…an <i>engagement</i> <i>ring</i>!"  Kasumi exclaimed happily.  Nabiki snatched Akane's hand.</p><p>"Well look at that…that's one heck of a diamond  there…" Nabiki said, smiling at Ranma.   Soun and Genma took their turns with their daughter's hand.</p><p>"Ranma…this is…I'm so happy for you two!"  Soun said, tears of joy starting.</p><p>"Ranma!   Congratulations boy!  You take  after your father."  Genma said.</p><p>The two proud fathers hugged each other.  Kasumi just smiled, happy for Akane.  Nabiki looked at Ranma. her question was  answered.</p><p>"H…hey…wait just a second.  It's nothing like that.  I  just wanted to give Akane something special, you know, to help her with the  duel."  Ranma said, nervously.</p><p>Akane turned to Ranma.  "But Ranma…I though that…" Akane looked down, sadly.</p><p>"Oh geeze…would you people just cut it out!  I just thought that since Akane was gonna  win that I should give her something that said that."</p><p>Everyone continued to praise Ranma's actions, except  Akane, she felt a bit lost and confused.   Ranma finished eating and went up stairs.  He had enough from everyone.   Eventually everyone followed suit, eager to greet the new morning.</p><p>Ranma and Akane awoke early that Monday.  Reluctantly, Ranma got dressed for  school.  He went down stairs, seeing  everyone was starting breakfast.  Ranma  finished in a hurried manner as to avoid any dialogue between him and his  parents.  Akane was quiet also.  She seemed a bit distant.  And the fact that her muscles were sore  didn't help matters.</p><p>The three students headed off for school; Nabiki  taking her usual transportation.  Ranma  walked along side Akane.  The two  weren't really saying much.</p><p>Ranma looked over to Akane.  She seemed a bit down.  "Umm…those were great moves back there at  the duel.  Where did you learn them?"</p><p>Akane continued to look down at the street.  "Well, I found this old Amazon book outside my  window.  It was gift-wrapped.  Someone had left it there for me to find."</p><p>Ranma thought for a second.  "I wonder who left it there…"</p><p>"I dunno."</p><p>"Well whoever did it, we need to thank them.  That <i>Divine Dragon God's Rage</i> attack  looked liked it took a long time to master."</p><p>Akane turned to Ranma; her mood slightly  lifted.  "Well, it really wasn't hard to  learn, it's the controlling of it that took longer.  I doubt I have full control yet.   Both you and Ryoga used a specific emotion.  I figured anger was a good one for me."</p><p>"Yea, you got that one right.  When it comes to anger, you're the tops."</p><p>Akane narrowed her eyes at Ranma.</p><p>"I remember all the times you got angry.  Come to think of it, that move should have  vaporized Shampoo if you put just half your rage in there." Ranma continued.</p><p>Akane slipped back into her previous state.</p><p>"Ok, Akane…what's wrong now?"</p><p>She said nothing.</p><p>"Geeze…" Ranma just continued to school, Akane  walking silently next to him.</p><p>The couple arrived at school.  Ranma looked around.  "I wonder where Kuno is…he's bound to show  up sooner or later."</p><p>"As predictable as the tides…a <i>criminal</i> always returns to the scene of the crime…" Kuno started, emerging from behind a  tree.  "The will of heaven is slow but  sure.  And as sure as the tides come in  and out, so does the wicked receive punishment.  Oh…what a duty is placed on my shoulders, for it is my fate to  carry on the will of the heavens.   However, it is only proper that I, Tatewaki Kuno, the Blue Thunder of  Furinkan High, be accepted to carry out the sentences of heaven.  Ranma Saotome!  You have committed a crime most heinous, and I shall smite the  down with the power of righteousness."</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes.  "Hey Kuno…of course I would return to the scene of the  crime.  I do attend this school…"</p><p>"Enough of your criminalistic psycho-babble!  Ranma Saotome, I challenge you!"  Kuno said, drawing his wooden sword.</p><p>"Bah…I don't have time to waste with the likes of  you.  Unless you like bleeding."</p><p>"Ranma!  I  cannot allow you to torment the precious Akane Tendou any longer.  This time, I shall deal to you a crushing  blow that shall surely…" Kuno paused suddenly; a look of extreme shock was on  his face.</p><p>Ranma had held up Akane's hand; the engagement ring  in full view.  Akane looked up to  Ranma.  She soon realized what he was  doing and turned her head from him, blushing.</p><p>"R…Ranma!   That is…I can <i>not</i> allow it!"   Kuno shouted, taking a fighting stance.   "Ranma…you have poisoned the lovely Akane Tendou with your charms.  But I am able to see through them.  Prepare to die, Ranma Saotome!"</p><p>During Kuno's little dialogue, Akane again looked at  Ranma.  He seemed so sure of his  actions.  "Maybe…he didn't mean all that  stuff yesterday.  Of course! He was just  trying to justify his actions, like he had always done.  Maybe I should listen to him…just this  once." She thought to herself.  Akane  then noticed that Ranma had let go of her hand.  She looked up, seeing Kuno charging.  Ranma was just standing there, calmly.</p><p>"I'll take care of this."  Akane said.  She dashed  over to Kuno with her newly acquired speed.   She ducked down, placing a palm strike firmly on his jaw.  A roundhouse kick sent Kuno on his  back.  Akane turned her back, heading  back to Ranma's side.</p><p>"A…Akane…what was that?"  Ranma asked; a bit stunned.</p><p>"Akane Tendou!   Ranma has poisoned your mind.   Please try to remember your love, Kuno Tatewaki!"</p><p>"I <i>do</i> remember my love, and I'm standing <i>next</i> to him!"  Ranma widened his eyes at Akane.</p><p>"But…Akane Tendou.   What about your…"</p><p>"Come on Ranma, lets get to class, we're going to be  late again if we don't hurry."  Akane  said, grabbing his hand and pulling him inside.</p><p>Ranma recovered from his state and followed her  inside, leaving Kuno and half the student body stunned.</p><p>Akane and Ranma entered their first class.  They sat down in their desks, a place they  haven't been in a week.  The teacher  started his plans and Ranma started his daily nap.  Akane looked over to a sleeping Ranma, smiling slightly.</p><p>"Well, Ranma…you did something for our relationship  now so have I.  Maybe things will start  to get better between us now.  I'm still  not ready for a marriage though, so don't try any funny stuff."  She continued looking at Ranma, the weight  in her chest felt much lighter after she said that to Kuno.</p><p>Another feeling sprung up in her chest.  She didn't like it.  Akane's mind wandered on their impending  marriage, an idea that almost made her shake with fear.  "I guess it will happen now" Akane's smile  wore off; she looked down at her desk, deep in though.  "I…just can't go through with it right  now…but I'll have to one day…  What  would Ranma think?"</p><p>She turned her attention to her ring, searching for  something that would clear her mind.  It  always seemed to be sparkling.  She  played with it a bit, turning it to the sun in various directions.  She still couldn't believe it.  "I wonder where Ranma got the money for  this.  It mush have cost a lot…well I  suppose if you work hard enough for something you will get it."  Akane continued to play with her ring,  missing the majority of the class.</p><p>Rumors abounded during lunch.  "They really <i>do</i> love each other", "I  wonder what happened to Akane, she seems to have gotten in a big fight" and,  "did you see Kuno get flattened by Akane?"   Ranma and Akane sat down at their usual spot. Akane's friends were  making too big a deal out of her ring, in Ranma's opinion.  He just sat at the lunch table, bored.</p><p><u>The More  Things Change…</u></p><p>School ended on a slow note.  Kuno was nowhere to be found.  Ranma and Akane walked home, side by  side.  Ranma thought for a few  minutes.  He had to say something about  what was going to happen next between the two.   His mind was wandering as much as Akane's</p><p>"Hey Akane…about our wedding…"</p><p>"Uh, oh…"Akane started. She was at a loss.</p><p>"I…I don't know what to say to Ranma" Akane thought  to herself "it would just crush him If I told him I couldn't go through with  it…not yet anyway."  The panic that  Akane felt in the schoolhouse started to rise again. She didn't quite know how  to handle the situation…</p><p>Akane whirled around with that look of hers.  "What about it?  Ok, so our fathers finally won their battle.  Big deal.   And maybe I did say I loved you.   So what.  That is no grounds to  go and start tripping over ourselves trying to plan a wedding."  Akane said, getting into Ranma's face.  Ranma stepped back, stunned</p><p>"Yea…and  maybe we did kiss the other day, that doesn't exactly make us husband and  wife.  More like really close  friends.  Still, that gives you no right  to assume that we are already married, because we're not.  And if you think you can change my mind with  your tricks, you got another thing coming pal.   I don't want any of your funny stuff!"   Akane turned her back to Ranma, walking to the dojo.</p><p>Ranma stood stunned for a few seconds.  "Hey!"   He recovered.  "  Where did that come from and where do you  get off yelling at me like that?  I just  wanted to see how you felt.  Geeze, you  are <i>so</i> un-cute sometimes."</p><p>"Well, you're the one that's plotting to get us  married so soon!"  Akane said, turning  back around.  Anger had replaced her  panic, something she was used to finally.</p><p>"W-What!   Where in the world did you come up with that?  You didn't lose any brain cells during your fight did you?  I have better things to think about than  some stupid wedding."</p><p>"Oh no you don't Ranma!  I know you!  You are  already plotting to propose to me in about a week or so!"</p><p>Ranma stomped to Akane, raising his fist.  "<i>I am not</i> plotting a wedding.  If anyone is plotting our wedding it's  you!  What was that kiss about the other  day then?"</p><p>"Please, Ranma.   I just wanted to show you that I was Ok, besides, I think you were about  to kiss me right before I came to."</p><p>"Yea right.   Like I would kiss an un-cute woman like you!"</p><p>"Well, you did!   I just didn't have the strength to resist it!"</p><p>"No I didn't!   You were the one that pulled me down to <i>your</i> face!  All I did was respect your wishes, like a  congratulations or somethin'."</p><p>"Ranma you stupid jerk!  <i>You</i> were the one that kissed me.  Besides, if you didn't want to kiss me you didn't have to!"</p><p>"Well, how was I gonna escape, your arm was around  my head!"</p><p>"I was worn out, you could have escaped easily if  you wanted to!"</p><p>"What was I suppose'd ta do?  "Oh no Akane, pleas don't kiss me, after  all, if you did, it would be like kissing a <i>guy</i>!""</p><p>"Oh, well I guess you know all about kissing guys,  don't you?"  Akane asked, insinuating  his past experiences.</p><p>"Yea, I do know what kissing guys is like!  You kissed me after all didn't you?"</p><p>"<i>What</i>!   How dare you…well maybe I did kiss you, but it wasn't like it was my  choice.  I was in pretty bad shape.  Maybe I mistook you for Kuno or…Ryoga"</p><p>"<i>Ryoga</i>!   How could you have ever mistaken me for that idiot with no directional  sense!  Oh, that's right.  You two did sleep together quite often  didn't you?"</p><p>"<i>That</i> was different Ranma!  I had no idea that Ryoga was P-Chan.  Well, you're just jealous that is wasn't you  sleeping beside me!"</p><p>"Well you should have figured it out!  It was practically beaten into you.  Why would he have been so desperate to get  to the <i>nannichaun</i>?"</p><p>"I just thought you two were starting to become friends…"</p><p>Ranma widened his eyes, staring in disbelief, his jaw dropped.</p><p>"What is it Ranma?"  Akane asked,  a bit worried.</p><p>"I had no idea…after all my travels around China and Japan…I had no idea  that…"</p><p>"Yea?  What?"</p><p>Ranma regained his focus.  "That  such an <i>unbelievably</i> un-cute tomboy existed in the entire world!  It is just beyond me on how un-cute you can  be sometimes!  Do they give you lessons  or somethin'?  Me and Ryoga could never  be friends, after all he did to me!"</p><p>"Ranma…You are <i>the</i> <i>most</i> perverted idiotic cross dresser I  have ever met!  Just be honest, you <i>were</i> jealous."</p><p>"Me, Jealous? <i>Please</i>!  If  anyone around here is jealous, it's you!"</p><p>"I am not jealous of a perverted cross dresser who can't even straighten  out who his fiancées are!"</p><p>"Yes you were!  That's why you  kissed me the other day.  So you could  keep me for yourself.  And don't give me  that mistaken identity crap.  I  distinctly heard you say "Ranma!"</p><p>Akane started to blush a bit.   "No I wasn't jealous… I…was just out of it was all.  Yea, I had been knocked out you know.  I could've kissed anyone.  Even Ryoga, had he saved me."</p><p>Ranma smiled confidently.  "I  knew it.  You could have never kissed a  person on your own!"</p><p>"What was that!"</p><p>"I said you could have never kissed another person, even if you life was  at stake!"</p><p>"Is that a challenge, Ranma?"</p><p>"Yea, it is.! You are too un-cute to kiss me!"</p><p>"Ranma!  If you want un-cute I'll  show you un-cute."  Akane said, drawing  closer to Ranma.  She grabbed the back  of his head, pulling him closer.  She  paused.  Their looks of anger had  vanished.  They stared at each other for  a few moments.  Akane got fed up.  She threw Ranma's head back and turned around  for the Dojo.</p><p>"Who would want to kiss a pervert like you  anyway?"  Akane said softly.</p><p>"Ah, I knew it!   Totally un-cute…and sexless too!"</p><p>Akane whirled around; her temper was flared.  "Ok Ranma, This is it!  I'll show you what sex-less really is!"  Akane ran to Ranma, grabbing his head  hard.  She pulled his face against  hers.  The pressure almost made Ranma's  lips hurt.  They stood like that for a  few seconds.  Akane's fingers were  digging into his skull.  She finally  released him, looking up at him menacingly.   She turned around, leaving Ranma standing alone.  Ranma was in shock.  After a few moments he recovered.</p><p>"Man…Akane called that a kiss?  More like a special attack than a kiss.  All though it was kinda nice."  Ranma though to himself, returning to the  Dojo.</p><p>Akane entered the Dojo, silently.  Ranma followed, his hands were behind his  head like nothing happened.  Soun and  Genma didn't bother asking what happened.   Kasumi just smiled, knowing that this would help them in the long  run.  Nabiki came down stairs, hearing  the door open.</p><p>Ranma tried his best to avoid her, but it was  futile.  "Hello Ranma…nice weather isn't  it?"</p><p>Ranma hung his head, forgetting about his  argument.  "I'll got a bowl of cold  water…" Nabiki smiled.</p><p>Akane flopped on her bed, hearing Ranma and Nabiki  talking about something.  Her anger  turned into sadness.  "What was my  problem back there?"  She asked herself.  "That was pretty sudden of me to burst on  Ranma like that.  What was I doing?  Maybe…I was just scared of getting married  too soon.  I just need a bit more time  to cope with all this.  Everything went  so slowly at first and all of a sudden it's all over."  Akane sighed to herself, looking at her  ring.</p><p>"Maybe I should to work off some of this  stress.  That helps me  out…usually."  Akane slipped the ring  off her finger.  "I better not train  with this thing on, Ranma would just die if I lost it."  Akane got dressed in her Gi and went to the  training hall.</p><p>Ranma, now female, walked out of Nabiki's room.  That didn't go so well.  Well, she would just sneak some at any  rate.  Ranma went to the kitchen,  starting a kettle of hot water.  Kasumi  was standing next to her, having almost finished dinner.  "Oh, hello Ranma.  Dinner is almost ready.   Would you please go get Akane?"</p><p>"Sure Kasumi.   Where is she hiding at now?"</p><p>"Oh…I believe she is in the training hall.  I saw her just briefly in her Gi.  I think she's gotten all worked up over  something."</p><p>Ranma poured the hot water on himself, and went in  to the training hall.</p><p>Akane stood in the hall, looking at her hands.   "Man…this new speed is incredible."  Akane smiled to herself.  "Maybe now I can finally beat Ranma in a  spar.  That is if he actually tries this  time."  Akane wiped the sweat form her  forehead.</p><p>Ranma entered the hall, looking for Akane.  Akane looked up to him and smiled.  "Oh, Hi Ranma.  I was just…uh…practicing some of my moves."</p><p>"Well, you can go ahead if you want to.  I just came to tell you that dinner is  almost done.  I'm gonna go back and  relax for a bit, things seem to be cooling down."</p><p>"Ok Ranma…be there in a little bit.  See ya later!"  Akane waved.</p><p>Ranma started to wave back. Akane seemed like she  was in a better mood, and her high spirits had brought his up a bit.  Ranma suddenly caught sight of Akane's  hand.  The ring wasn't there.  Ranma looked back to Akane, sadly.  Akane had turned around, practicing a bit  more.  "So that's why she seems to be  doing better…maybe she finally decided what she wanted…" Ranma thought to  himself.</p><p>"So…that's why you yelled at me earlier today.  You know, you could have just told me  instead of yelling like that."</p><p>Akane turned around.  "Huh?  What are you  talking about?"</p><p>Ranma started to get a bit angry.  "You know exactly what I'm talking about so  don't play stupid with me.  Besides, its  not like I care either way…" Ranma said, leaving the hall and going outside.</p><p>"What?   Hey!  Wait a second Ranma.  What are you talking about?"  Akane said, chasing after him.  She stopped at the archway, watching Ranma  just walk off into the dusk.  Nabiki  followed Akane.  "What's with  Ranma?  Did you yell at him again?"</p><p>"Well yea, but not recently. That was earlier  today.  I don't know what happened.  He just got mad all of a sudden, saying "you  could have just told me instead of yelling.""</p><p>"Well, sis, what did you yell at him for."</p><p>Akane started to blush a bit.  "Uh…well…Ranma said something about marriage  and I told him not to do anything funny.   Then we got into an argument, I forget exactly what it was about."</p><p>"Well, maybe he's still mad about what you  said.  You do have that track record you  know."</p><p>"Yea…" Akane said thoughtfully.</p><p>"Well, come on in sis, dinner is ready.  Ranma will return with he's cooled off a  bit.  Its not like Shampoo is around or  anything so you shouldn't worry."  With  that, Nabiki grabbed Akane's hand, noticing the ring wasn't there.</p><p>"Hey Akane, where's your ring at?"</p><p>"Oh, I took it off to train a bit.  I really didn't want to lose it.  Ranma would have lost it had he seen me  without it.  He must have spent a…"  Suddenly, Akane figured out why Ranma was mad.</p><p>"Wait a second.   You think he thinks I lost it…" Akane asked, not allowing Nabiki to take  her inside.  The first bit of starlight  started.</p><p>"Well…I don't know…it's a possibility."</p><p>"Well, I better go and get it to show him I haven't  lost it." Akane said, returning to her room and slipping it on.  She ran off towards where Ranma was  walking.  He was walking to where Akane  had practiced in the empty lot.</p><p>"Man…what is the big deal.  Did he really think I lost it?"   Akane thought to herself as she ran after Ranma.  "Well I would be mad too if I gave him a  ring and he lost it.  Actually I would  be really mad."  Akane saw Ranma walking  the down the street, his hands were in his pockets and his head was hung low.</p><p>"Ranma!   Ranma!  Wait up a sec!"</p><p>Ranma did not listen.</p><p>Akane ran up to him, standing in his path.  "Hey Ranma…will you listen to me?"  Ranma ignored Akane's pleas, continuing to  walk forward.</p><p>"Ranma you jerk, why wont you listen to me?"</p><p>Ranma turned around.  "Because you can't be honest with anyone!  That's why!"  Ranma turned back around, continuing his walk.</p><p>"Be honest with anyone…what is he talking  about?"  Akane thought.</p><p>"Ranma…what are you talking about!"</p><p>"I'm talking about that argument we had.  If you didn't want to get married you could  have just said so instead of trying to hide it."</p><p>"Ranma…I still…want to get married…just…not right  now.  I never tried to hide it from  you…" Akane said, approaching Ranma.   That was pretty hard for her to say, and maybe she did try to hide it…</p><p>"Yea you did.   You even stopped wearing the ring I gave you a few days ago.  Its not like I care or anything…I just  thought it would make a nice gift is all."</p><p>"So that's what this is about…" Akane thought to herself.</p><p>"But Ranma.   I had to take off the ring.  I  was training and I didn't want to lose it.   I would have just died if I had lost it.  But…since you don't really care…" A tear appeared in Akane's  eyes.  The moon did its best on hiding  it with shadows.</p><p>"So…you still want to get married then…but I thought  since you yelled at me for saying it that you didn't want to…"</p><p>"No…that's not it.   Its just…I was kind of scared at everything that happened the past few  days.  In fact, I was almost in a  panic…things were moving too fast for me.   I was used to the slow pace."</p><p>"So you really want to go through with it?"</p><p>"Yea Ranma…just not right now."</p><p>Ranma smiled.   "Well, sorry about going overboard with that.  It was a kinda hard decision to get you that ring.  I guess I was just afraid that you mighta  said no…" Ranma's chest now felt a bit lighter.</p><p>"Of course I wouldn't.  So that means you <i>do</i> care about the wedding then."  Akane started smiling</p><p>"Yea…I mean only if you care about it."</p><p>"Well yea…just not right now…"</p><p>"Well of course not right now…we are still in  school.  I guess we should wait just a  little bit.  To tell you the truth I'm  kinda scared about the whole thing too."   Ranma said, nervously scratching his head.</p><p>"Well, I guess it's my fault.  I shouldn't have yelled at you earlier."</p><p>"Yea and I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions like  that.</p><p>"Yea…I know how that is."</p><p>"Well you should.   You always seemed to jump to conclusions, especially when everyone was  around."</p><p>Akane just smiled.   She would forgive that one…just this once.  "Well Ranma.  Kasumi fixed  dinner.  Lets go eat."</p><p>"Ok, sure thing."   Ranma said, walking along side Akane.</p><p>"Oh, and Ranma, I didn't really jump to conclusions  that much."</p><p>"Yes you did.   In fact every single time you did."</p><p>"No I didn't!"</p><p>"Yes you did!   When Shampoo would grab me I would always try to push her away and you  would get mad at <i>me</i>, like it was my fault!"</p><p>"I was you fault!   If you weren't' such a perverted jerk none of this would have happened!"</p><p>"Wait a second!   Pops takes me to Jusenkyo to train and kicks me into the spring and it's  <i>my</i> fault?  Geeze…you are so  un-cute sometimes!"</p><p>The couple continued to the Dojo, arguing, but  secretly happy.  Maybe they finally  started to understand…</p><p>*****Ah yes. My famous set up chapters. Actually, I feel  this was an important step of development for our favorite couple. Lets' see. It's  4:30 in the morning, it's snowing outside, and I'm listening to my newest CD "TWO-MIX:  Super best files". You guys have got to get that CD. It rules! And as a plus,  the Voice actor of Nabiki in Japanese is the lead singer in TWO-MIX. Pretty  neat huh? Though I can't remember her name for the life of me…</p><p>Well, again, sorry for not updating this in such a  long time. You know how it gets. Man, weeks pass so fast.</p><p>So, that's about it so far. It looks as though I'm  doing fairly well review wise. Thanks guys! I really appreciate it.  Although I maybe asking for it in this  chapter. I usually spend more than five minutes re-reading my chapters, but  tonight, I wanna work on my newest Fanfic. I have no idea what it's about. And  it's not <u>Grateful days</u> either. I stumbled on that pretty hard, and it  really needs a refocusing again…</p><p>Until next we meet!*****</p>
