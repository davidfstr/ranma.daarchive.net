</div><p>Chapter  Fifteen</p><p><u>Ranma's  Proposal!</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane happily walked down stairs for  breakfast.  They again resumed their  seats next to each other.  Soun and  Genma looked their children proudly.   Something had happened to their children:  Something very good.</p><p>"Oh, isn't today just a lovely day!"  Kasumi exclaimed, looking outside.  The sun was nice and bright, highlighting  the Dojo in a yellow hue.  Not a cloud  was in the sky.</p><p>"It sure is Kasumi" Ranma said happily.  He turned and smiled to Akane.  She returned his smile, warmly.</p><p>Suddenly, Akane remembered something.</p><p>"Hey…where's Ryoga?"  She asked, looking around a bit.</p><p>Everyone shrugged.</p><p>"I dunno Akane…we better go look for him.  Hopefully he is still in the city." Ranma  replied</p><p>"Yea we <i>should</i> go look for him.  He is determined to apologize to you for  what he had done to us."</p><p>Ranma smiled nervously.  "Yea…I guess I really didn't hear him out that first time."</p><p>Ranma and Akane got up and started out the  door.  Soun smiled to Genma.</p><p>"The table is set Saotome!"  Soun said, smiling.</p><p>"Indeed it is, Tendou.  May our children forgive us for interfering one last time."</p><p>"I would think they would thank us, rather than  fault us for doing what we have in mind."</p><p>"I would hope so.   Something has definitely changed between those two.  You can tell because of the way they look at  each other."</p><p>"Well daddy, they finally did as you requested.  It took a bit longer than I thought though…"  Nabiki added.</p><p>"Yes…all of their previous ties have been broken."</p><p>"Well…I wouldn't go that far daddy.  The Kuno residence is still up in arms…"</p><p>Soun smiled.   "Well, they are the least of our worries now.  Would you be so kind as to help us Nabiki?"</p><p>"Sure daddy!"   Nabiki said.  She winked at her  father.  "Of course…there is this outfit  I'm looking at…"</p><p>Soun and Genma started laughing.</p><p>"Ah…my Nabiki…always the business woman.  You will do fine at Tokyo University."</p><p>Nabiki smiled at her father.  "Don't try to change to subject."  She said, holding out her hand.</p><p>Soun pulled out his wallet, handing her a 5000-yen  note.</p><p>"I'll keep those two away for you."  She said, going upstairs.  Soun and Genma needed a bit of time to  prepare whatever they had in mind.</p><p>Kasumi just smiled on, listening to everyone.</p><p>"Oh dear…I better get started on the laundry for  those two."  She said, excusing herself  and going about her chores.</p><p><u>Forgiveness!</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane returned to the Dojo after a few  hours, defeated.  They had split up and  searched the entire surrounding area.   The couple walked under the archway, spying Nabiki emerging out the  door.</p><p>"Hey you two!   What brings you back?"</p><p>"We decided to give up lookin' for Ryoga.  When that guy gets lost he stays lost."  Ranma said.</p><p>Akane nodded.   "Yea we checked the park, that vacant lot, we even went downtown towards  the mall.  No Ryoga."</p><p>"What a shame…" Nabiki said.  Ranma started to enter the Dojo.  Nabiki moved, placing herself in front of  the doorknob.</p><p>"Nabiki?"   Ranma asked.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Is somethin' goin' on?"</p><p>"Now you know better than that Ranma."  Nabiki said, smiling.</p><p>Ranma turned to Akane.  "I don't trust her."</p><p>"Come on sister.   What is going on?"  Akane tried</p><p>"Well…if you must know…" Nabiki said, waving them to  come closer to her.  Ranma and Akane  leaned forward.</p><p>Nabiki leaned to them, in a manner to suggest  something secretive.  She quickly  resumed her guarding position, standing up straight and leaving Ranma and Akane  perplexed, expecting an answer.</p><p>"You know…I'm kinda hungry…maybe for some…oh I don't  know…Okonomiyaki, I could tell you what's going on."</p><p>Ranma scoffed.   "Yea right Nabiki, just let us in."</p><p>Akane tugged Ranma's shirt as he took a step closer  to the door.  "You know Ranma…I'm kinda  hungry too.  Why don't we go visit Ukyo?  Obviously Nabiki is hiding something…"</p><p>Ranma looked at Nabiki, smiling there.  She <i>was</i> hiding something.  He turned to Akane. She smiled.</p><p>"Sure Akane.   We'll grab somethin' to eat.   I'll bring some back for everyone else."  Ranma said, eyeing Nabiki suspiciously.</p><p>"Ok Ranma <i>Ciao</i>!"  She said, holding her ground.   Ranma and Akane looked one last time at her, before turning around and  heading towards Ukyo's shop.</p><p>Nabiki smiled to herself.  "Daddy is so gonna owe me one…" she said, entering.  "I sure hope they like what we are  planning."</p><p>"What was up with Nabiki?"  Ranma asked, looking down at Akane.</p><p>"I dunno…something is gonna happen…I can feel it."</p><p>"Yea I know what you mean.  I can feel something too."</p><p>Ranma and Akane entered Uc-Chan's, spying a familiar  figure sitting on next to the grill, talking to Ukyo.</p><p>"Ryoga!"   Akane said, surprised.  "What are  you doing here?"</p><p>Ryoga turned around.  "Oh…Hello Ranma and Akane…I uh…" he attempted, laughing  nervously.</p><p>Ukyo emerged from behind the grill.  "Poor Ryoga here got lost.  He told me he tried to find your backyard,  but ended up wandering around town all night.   When I opened the shop in the morning, I spotted him, wandering  around.  I invited him inside to get a  quick nap.  He just woke up, so I  decided to fix him breakfast…well lunch now."</p><p>Ranma and Akane smiled at that story.  Ryoga laughed, embarrassed once again.  They sat next to him, placing their  orders.</p><p>"So…" Ukyo began.   "Ryoga tells me he came back to apologize…"</p><p>Ryoga looked up, stunned.  He leaped off his chair and bowed low towards Ranma.</p><p>"Ranma…I almost forgot.  Can you forgive me?"</p><p>Ranma was taken aback.  "S…sure Ryoga…just…stop actin' so weird."</p><p>Ryoga eyed Ranma, dumbfounded…was that it?   It couldn't be that easy…not after all the  hardships he had put Ranma through.</p><p>Akane looked  up at Ranma. "Well…that was easy…"</p><p>Ranma nodded.   "What's done is done…no use holdin' on to the past…isn't that right  Ryoga?"</p><p>A few moments passed. Holding on to the past…that's  what got Ryoga into all this to begin with…</p><p>"Any word from Shampoo or Cologne?"  Ukyo asked, stirring some batter.</p><p>"No…they are prolly deep inside China.  I hope they took Mousse with 'em."  Ranma said.</p><p>Ryoga looked at him, confused.  Akane noticed this.</p><p>"We tried to hook up Mousse and Shampoo.  She was taking her defeat pretty hard, and  Cologne kinda asked for our help.  It  was the least we could do, especially after she helped me train."</p><p>"Cologne trained you?"  Ryoga asked, interested.</p><p>"Yea…after seeing all the moves I learned she  offered to train me…kind of like an apology or something."</p><p>"Yea…I saw that fight.  Where on earth did you learn all that?"</p><p>"Well…Mousse gave me this ancient book.  That's another reason why we decided to help  him."</p><p>Ryoga nodded, understanding what had happened in his  absence.</p><p>Everyone finished his or her meal.  Ukyo handed Ranma a series of boxes  containing Okonomiyaki for the rest of his family.  Akane waved as she, Ranma and Ryoga started back to the Dojo.</p><p>They emerged from the shop, seeing Nabiki running  towards them.  Everyone looked at her;  she was up to something.</p><p>"Hey…Akane…" Nabiki said, a bit winded.  She took a few seconds to regain her breath  before continuing.  "You have <i>got</i>  to see the new clothes at the mall.   They are just so cute, you would just die for them."</p><p>"…Ok sister."   Akane said suspiciously.  "Let's  just drop this stuff off first."</p><p>Nabiki shook her finger playfully.  "No you don't Akane.  <i>We</i> will meet you there."  She said, looking at Ryoga.</p><p>"We?"  Ryoga  asked.</p><p>"Yea, you can take those Okonomiyaki back to the  Dojo.  Surely you don't expect a lady  such as myself to carry those."</p><p>"Hey!"  Ranma  interrupted.  "How come <i>he</i> gets  to go back to the Dojo?"</p><p>"Because he isn't the fiancée of a certain sister of  mine that <i>needs</i> to go to the mall before everything is gone."  Nabiki returned.</p><p>Ranma and Akane looked at each other.  Ryoga was just confused.</p><p>"Whatever…" Ranma finally said.  "Let's go Akane…I could use a few things  too…"</p><p>Akane nodded.   "See ya at the mall.  We'll wait  for you in the food court."</p><p>The two started off.</p><p>Nabiki smiled at Ryoga, holding the Okonomiyaki.</p><p>"Ms Nabiki…what is going on?"</p><p>"Just a little surprise for those two, that's  all.  Come on now Ryoga.  Daddy and Mr. Saotome are starving."</p><p>"S-sure" Ryoga said, following Nabiki.  It would have been nice if he could find his  own way back to the Dojo.  Ryoga and  Nabiki delivered their goodies and started back to the mall.  He saw what Soun and Genma were planning.  He shook his head.  Good luck…Ranma Saotome.</p><p><u>Mall…or  Maul?</u></p><p>Everyone was gathered inside the mall.  Nabiki lead the way to the really cute  outfits she had told Akane about.  Akane  just had to try some on; she still had a bit of her money left and it was  burning a hole in her pocket.  Akane  took a really cute skirt and top combo and entered the dressing room.  Nabiki went over to Ranma stealthily.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…" she said, nudging him.  Ranma turned to her.</p><p>"Let me give you a piece of advice that will <i>greatly</i>  help your marriage.  Free of  charge.  No matter how Akane looks when  she comes out of their, just say you like it.   She could try on fifty dresses.   Say you like <i>all</i> of them.   Trust me, she will love you forever for doing that."</p><p>Ranma eyed Nabiki, confused.  Nabiki smiled.</p><p>After a few moments Akane emerged, showing off  herself to everyone.</p><p>Ranma thought to himself.  "I don't know…that top seems a bit too big for her.  Her waist isn't really made for skirts like  that one…but Nabiki said that I should just say I like it…"</p><p>"What do you think Ranma?"  Akane asked, smiling.</p><p>Ranma placed his hand on his chin, turning his head  a bit to get different angles.  Nabiki  nudged him again.</p><p>"Trust me Ranma." She whispered</p><p>Ranma nodded and turned to Akane, smiling.  "I think it looks great!"  He said.   Akane beamed proudly.</p><p>"Really?   Oh…that's great!  Here…hold on to  these!"  Akane said, handing Ranma a  stack of clothing.  Akane took the first  one and went back to try the next one on.   Ranma turned to Nabiki, worriedly.</p><p>"You like every single one of them.  Remember that Ranma…" she said, winking at  him. She turned to go somewhere else.</p><p>"Hey…wait a sec Nabiki.  Isn't that like lying…I would hate to lie to Akane."</p><p>"No…it's not like lying.  When a woman asks you a question like…"Do you like it" They  expect you to lie to them.  So it's not  really like lying…its kinda hard to explain but trust me, you'll understand  when she gets to all those dresses she is planning on modeling."</p><p>Ranma looked at the stack.  That was close to the middle.   Akane emerged again, wearing a blue dress with a white top and some sort  of vest thing that matched the bottom.</p><p>"Well Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma turned to Nabiki one last time.  Nabiki nodded, smiling.</p><p>"I think it looks great!"  He said, smiling</p><p>Akane nodded happily, going further down the  stack.  Ranma got bored after the  millionth one.</p><p>Finally, after what seemed like hours but was really  only about 30 minutes, Akane had finished.   She decided on only two of the millions of dresses she tried on.  That made Ranma roll his eyes…He <i>was</i>,  however amazed that he could say the same, " I think it looks great" line over  and over, without Akane noticing.   Nabiki was on to something…</p><p>"Ok Ranma…I think we can go back to the Dojo  now."  Akane said</p><p>"We better find Ryoga first.  He's prolly lost inside a clothes rack or  somethin'"</p><p>"Oh yea…I was wondering where he was.  How could he lose us that easily?"</p><p>Ranma just shook his head.  "We'll meet back at the food court.  We should split up to cover more ground."</p><p>With that the two headed to find Ryoga…again.</p><p>Ryoga stood in the middle of somewhere, staring at a  map of the mall.  He eyed the curious  little dot, representing himself.  He  took his eyes off the dot and looked around.   He didn't see that dot anywhere around the mall.  He had been searching for it for about  fifteen minutes.  If only he could find  it…he would know exactly where he was.</p><p>"Excuse me."   He said to a passer-by.  "Where  is this?"  He asked, pointing to that  red dot.</p><p>"It's right here."   He said, pointing to the ground.</p><p>Ryoga eyed him, confused.  "Thank you" he said, bowing a bit.  That guy didn't help.</p><p>Ryoga thought to himself.  Nabiki said something about clothes…</p><p>He pulled another person over to him.  "Excuse me…where is the clothes store?"</p><p>"Which one."   The man asked.</p><p>"Um…the one where Akane Tendou is at." Ryoga  returned.</p><p>The man pointed.   "Straight that way…just follow the path.  That's how to get to the biggest one."</p><p>Ryoga nodded.   "Thank you.  Sorry for disturbing  you."  He headed straight, coming to a  bend in the walkway.</p><p>"That nice man said it was straight!"  Ryoga said to himself.  He went straight…into an electronics  place.  He somehow managed to reach the  back of the store:  Just a wall.</p><p>Ryoga turned around, having been defeated by yet  another plaster and concrete barrier.   He stepped back outside.  It  seemed like the whole mall had changed.</p><p>"Where the hell am I now?"  He asked himself, looking around at all the people.</p><p>"Oh…Ryoga!   Over here!"  A voice called to  him.  He looked.  It was Akane, smiling and waving her hand.  She carried a large plastic bag.  It had a few things inside.</p><p>Ryoga approached her.  "Sorry Akane…I was looking for the clothes store." Akane pointed  down the hall.  It was the clothing  store.</p><p>"Come on Ryoga, Ranma is waiting for us there."  The two started off, catching up with Ranma  and Nabiki.</p><p>Everyone, having found everyone else, started to the  Dojo.  It was past afternoon, almost  time for Kasumi to start cooking dinner.</p><p>"So… are we allowed back home now?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>Nabiki nodded.   "Yea Ranma.  I'll bet daddy and  Mr. Saotome are finished by now."</p><p>"What are they plotting?"  He asked, cutting to the point.   "I could have easily found out for myself…"</p><p>"Well…let's just say you two have had this coming  for a long time now."</p><p>"Geeze…whatever.   It better be good."</p><p>"Trust me Ranma.   It is."  Ryoga said.</p><p>"What?  You  are in on it too Ryoga?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Well…I saw what everyone was doing when I delivered  their lunch."</p><p>The group neared the Dojo.  Ranma sighed to himself.   Akane didn't seem that worried.   That was a good thing.  Nabiki stood  next to the door, as if to indicate they should open it.  They started to the door, unknowing what was  about to happen.</p><p><u>Day of  Reckoning</u></p><p>Akane paused, looking at the Dojo sign.  It read.   "Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts."</p><p>"What do you think Ranma?"  Akane asked, looking at the new sign.</p><p>"I dunno Akane. I think the sign is ok…but something  else is going on…besides that new sign.   I'll bet they turned the Dojo into some sort of wedding chapel."  Ranma said, leaning against the nearest post.  "Yea…just you watch.  As soon as you open that door everyone will  be in there, holdin' up our wedding clothes.   Then watch 'em run up here, all smilin' and stuff."</p><p>"R…Really?   You think that's what everyone was up to?"  Akane was a bit nervous…but she was ready for anything.</p><p>Ranma nodded.   Akane moved her hand to the doorknob.   She placed her hand on the knob, turning it and pushing the door open  slowly.  Reluctantly, she looked inside,  gasping a bit.</p><p>Ranma just leaned against the post.  "See?   What did I tell ya?  I'll bet the  wedding cake is even in there isn't it?"</p><p>"Well…not exactly…" Akane said.  Ranma, noticing Akane's state, looked inside  the Dojo. He blinked a few times.</p><p>Ranma looked to everyone, sitting around, with  nothing much happening.  Soun and Genma  were playing GO.  Kasumi had started  dinner.  Everything looked conveniently  normal…too normal…</p><p>"Ok Pops…we know you were plottin' somethin'.  What did you two do?"  Ranma asked accusingly.</p><p>Genma ignored the inquiry.</p><p>"Akane…there is something in your room...'' Soun  said, planning his next move.</p><p>Akane looked at her father, perplexed.  "Ok…"she said, heading up stairs slowly.</p><p>"You go too boy."   Genma said, responding to Soun's latest move.</p><p>"Sure…"</p><p>Ranma caught up to Akane.  Ryoga slapped him on the back, smiling.</p><p>"Congrats Ranma…I really envy you."  He said.</p><p>"Uh…thanks Ryoga."   Ranma eyed him for a few more seconds before catching up to Akane.</p><p>Akane stood at her door.  She was looking at something.</p><p>Ranma came up next to her.  Akane sign had been changed again to read:  "Ranma and Akane" It wasn't written on like  in previous attempts, but looked to be custom made.</p><p>"Any ideas Ranma?"   Akane asked, moving her hand to the door.</p><p>"Yea…I have an idea…I'll bet there is a big wedding  dress hangin' in your room.  Then I'm  suppose'ta open my room, findin' a very convenient tuxedo…"</p><p>Akane again opened the door slowly.  The two peered inside, taking in what they  saw…</p><p>"W…what?  But  isn't this a bit too…" Ranma trailed off his words.</p><p>"Not exactly what you said Ranma…" Akane admitted.</p><p>Their eyes rested upon an altered room.  Akane's desk was moved to the corner of her  room, a little dresser sat next to it.   In the in front of the window, rest a bed twice the size of the one she  had previously…  That large bed took up  a bit of room, making her room seem a bit cramped.</p><p>"…sudden…"   Akane said, finishing Ranma's pervious sentence.  "I think that's what you were gonna say  right Ranma?"  Everyone was now looking  at the two, standing there, a bit amazed.</p><p>The couple turned around to greet everyone.  They were starting to blush a bit and  smiling nervously</p><p>"Well…what do you think?"  Nabiki asked.</p><p>Ranma thought back to what she had said earlier that  day.</p><p>"Uh…I think it looks great?"  Ranma offered, scratching his head.</p><p>"No Ranma…this is different.  That only works with women and clothes…"</p><p>Their fathers came up to their children, hugging  them proudly.</p><p>"We know you will just love your new living  arrangements.  Everything that you both  need is in there.  Even Ranma's stuff."  Genma said.</p><p>Ranma and Akane eyed each other for a moment.</p><p>"Well…thanks everyone…" Akane said sheepishly.</p><p>Satisfied, everyone left the two upstairs, going  about their business.  Ryoga  stayed.  He was smiling a bit too big.</p><p>"Good luck Ranma…you're going to need it."  He said, going back down stairs.</p><p>"H-hey wait a sec Ryoga…" Ranma tried.  He was about to go down after him, but  decided against it, seeing Akane was acting funny.</p><p>He turned to her, nervous and a bit embarrassed.</p><p>"So…uh…Akane…what do you think?"</p><p>"I…uh…well…I think it's a good idea…we might as well  start to…I mean…you know…once we were married we would have to sleep in the  same bed anyway."</p><p>"Uh…yea…"</p><p>The two stood there in silence a few moments.</p><p>"So…Akane…see you tonight I guess?"</p><p>"Uh…sure Ranma…"</p><p>Ranma tried a smile.  "Sure Akane…"</p><p>"Ok then Ranma…"</p><p>"Ok then…I'm gonna go down stairs…" Ranma said,  starting off.  He turned back around to  Akane.  "I got dibs on the right hand  side."</p><p>"Sure…"</p><p>With that Ranma went down stairs, planning on  talking to Ryoga.</p><p>Akane entered her new room.  She looked around.  That dresser was a nice touch.   She eyed her new bed.  She  decided to test it out.  She sat down on  it.  It felt extremely comfortable.  Akane couldn't help but smile at her and  Ranma's plight.</p><p>"I wonder what Ranma is thinking about all  this."  She said to herself, lying down  across her bed.  Even the blankets and  pillows felt soft.  Every piece of the  bed was new.  She slid over to the left  side of the bed, picturing Ranma there next to her.</p><p>"I guess I could get used to this."  She said to herself.  She did love Ranma, and the fact of sharing  a bed would only strengthen their relationship.  "He better not take my blankets though…" she said, rising.  This room needed a few more touches…</p><p>Ranma chased down Ryoga.  He dragged him to the training hall, where he could talk with out  all those other ears.</p><p>"Hey Ryoga…what did you mean "good luck"?"  He asked</p><p>Ryoga smiled.   "Well…I have had my fair amount of time in Akane's bed.  Trust me…you're in for it…"</p><p>Ranma thought for a minute.  He remembered the horror stories.</p><p>"Any suggestions?"   He asked</p><p>"A helmet and face guard would help.  Also shoulder pads."  Ryoga said seriously.</p><p>"Come on Ryoga…this isn't funny…"</p><p>"I'm not kidding around Ranma…"</p><p>Ranma's face turned into a grim look.  Ryoga turned his back, heading out the  training hall.</p><p>"You know Ranma…I really do envy you.  You are doing what I could only have dreamed  of doing."</p><p>Ranma turned to Ryoga.  He simply left, going back to the dining room and watching some  TV.</p><p>"Ryoga envies me huh?"  Ranma said to himself.   "Well…I guess this could work our after all."  Ranma smiled to himself.   "I wonder how Akane is taking this…well at least I'll have someone cute  to sleep next to.  I could get used to  that."</p><p>Dinner eventually arrived.  Everyone was just in a plain cheerful mood.  Ryoga looked at everyone.  They really were a nice family.  What in the world made him think he could  break Ranma and Akane up like that?</p><p>"Don't worry Ryoga.   You can sleep where Ranma used to."   Kasumi said, handing him his plate in a friendly manner.</p><p>"Th…thanks Ms Kasumi.  It will be a welcome change from sleeping outside."</p><p>"So Ranma and Akane, how did you like the new sign  for the Dojo?"  Soun asked.  "We were going to wait until the day of your  wedding to do all that we did today, but Ryoga has a place to sleep now.  We didn't think you would mind in the  slightest."</p><p>"I think it looks great.  You know…I was thinkin'…" Ranma started.</p><p>"About what boy?"   Genma asked</p><p>"Well…it's kinda silly but…I'm a lot faster as a  female.  I was thinkin' about trying to  improve my speed as a male.  You  know…for the sake of the Dojo."</p><p>"Ranma…I think you're fast enough as a male."  Akane admitted.  "I still have trouble keeping up with you."</p><p>"Well…being a female has its advantages in a match I  guess…" Ranma said, bringing his chopsticks up to his mouth.</p><p>"How about trying that theory on me Ranma?"  Ryoga asked.  "While I was gone, I didn't exactly go on a pleasure cruise.  I think my skills have improved."</p><p>Ranma smiled slyly at Ryoga.  "Any time."</p><p>Dinner finished up in its traditional fashion.  Ranma and Ryoga decided to have their match  bright and early tomorrow.</p><p>Ranma decided it was time for bed.  He almost walked passed his new room.  He listened carefully. He heard the sound of  running water.  Akane was taking her  bath.  Ranma opened the door to his new  room and stepped inside, taking a good look around for the first time.  He eyed the bed…with an air of cautious  optimism.  It had fluffy blankets and  two seemingly soft pillows.  He sat down  on it.  It was very soft, a lot better  than that makeshift bed he had been sleeping on.  To top it all off, he was with his fiancée.  This <i>could</i> work out nicely</p><p>"This should be fun."  He said to himself.  He  started to the dresser.  No doubt their  clothes were in there.  He opened the  first drawer.  Those were his day  clothes in there.  He opened the one  next to it.  It was full of all kinds of  women's underwear.</p><p>"Is this some kinda sick joke?"  Ranma asked no one in particular.  He spied a familiar looking blue pair of  panties.  "Oh…this is Akane's drawer…I  better stay outta that one."  He said.</p><p>He heard the door open; he turned to the sound.  Akane was standing there, her hair was  dripping wet and she had a big towel wrapped around her form.</p><p>"Ranma…what are you doing?"  She asked, puzzled.</p><p>Ranma smiled nervously.  "Oh...hi Akane…I was just lookin' for my night clothes.</p><p>Akane came beside him, still dripping everywhere.  She opened the drawer beneath his.</p><p>"I put all that stuff for you in here.  Our Fathers had it all mixed up.  You get the right side and I'll get the  left."  She said, smiling at her  brilliant idea.</p><p>"Ok…thanks."   He said, taking out his clothes.  He looked back to Akane, noticing that she hadn't moved.  He suddenly realized what was happening.</p><p>"Oh…sorry Akane…I…uh…I'll go change in the  bathroom.''  He said.</p><p>"Thanks Ranma."   Akane said</p><p>Ranma went to the bathroom, changing into his  nightclothes.  They shouldn't rush  this…that was all a bit too fast right there…for both of them.</p><p>Ranma got changed and again approached the door,  knocking on it.</p><p>"Yea?  Come  in."  Said Akane through the door.</p><p>Ranma entered, a bit nervously.</p><p>"Oh…uh hi Ranma…"</p><p>"Hi Akane…" he said sitting down on his side of the  bed.  Akane followed suit on the left  side.</p><p>The silence was quickly getting to them both.</p><p>"Are you…nervous Ranma?" Akane asked.  "We don't have to do this if you don't want  to…"</p><p>"Uh…well I was kinda looking forward to it  …besides…were gonna get married really soon any way.  Might as well get used to it."</p><p>Akane smiled, nervously.  "Yea…I guess you're right.   Well, good night!"  Akane said,  turning out the light.  They had better  try to get some sleep or they would just sit there forever, pondering and  talking to each other.</p><p>"Good night Akane."   Ranma returned, lying down.  The  room got eerily dark and quiet.  Ranma  lay with his eyes open, adjusting to the darkness for what seemed like hours,  but was really about five minutes.  He  felt strangely comforted at everything that was happening, but was also a bit  scared at the same time.</p><p>"Hey Akane…" he whispered.  "Can you sleep?"</p><p>"No Ranma…" Akane admitted.  She was staring at the ceiling also.</p><p>"This is kinda strange isn't it?"  Ranma admitted.</p><p>"Yea it is…but I knew that one day this day would  come.  Who would have guessed it would  come so suddenly?"</p><p>"Yea really."   Ranma said, turning to face Akane.   He could just make her face out in the darkness.  "We had a lot of people out to get us.  I figured it woulda took a few years to get  all this stuff straightened out."</p><p>"Yea…" Akane said thoughtfully.  A few moments of silence passed.</p><p>"Hey Akane…remember when I first came to the Dojo  and you tried to drown me in the bathtub?"</p><p>"Yea I remember that.  I was so mad at you.  I  had no idea who you were.  All I knew  was that I wanted to kill you."</p><p>"You had long hair back then.  I really do think it's a lot better  short.  It suits your active style a lot  better than long hair.  I was kinda  surprised to see how cute you were with short hair."</p><p>"Yea…and then I pushed you into that water.  Did you…really think I was cute…all the way  back then?"</p><p>"Well yea…it was kinda hard to tell ya though, what  with us arguing so much and stuff.  I  really didn't know what to think, what with me just havin' met you for the  first time."</p><p>"Well…what <i>did</i> you think of me when we first  met?"</p><p>Ranma thought for a few moments.  "Well…you were violent…tomboyish.  You lacked a lot of class.  You were always yelling at me for no  reason.  But you were kinda cute…in a  sorta violent tomboyish yelling fashion."</p><p>"Thanks Ranma…I think."</p><p>"So…what about me.   What did you think about me?"</p><p>"I was totally against our marriage…until you saved  me from Ryoga the first time I met him.   And we were up on that roof thing…and you were holding me.  That's when I actually thought about it for  the first time.  You were so stupid…and  perverted.  You didn't have any sense of  socialization at all. You would always speak your mind. But…I…kinda got used to  it after a while."</p><p>"Yea…I guess I kinda did a lot of stupid stuff since  I came all the way here.  Like with  Shampoo and everyone."</p><p>"I think we were both doing stupid stuff."</p><p>"Well…all that is over with now isn't it?"</p><p>"Yea…unless you suddenly happen to get another  fiancée or happen to fall into spring of drown…who knows what."</p><p>That word spring made Ranma think a bit.</p><p>"You know…I never really stopped to think what it  musta been like for you to have a fiancée that is cursed."  Ranma said.</p><p>"It was strange at first…but…"</p><p>"But what?"</p><p>"I would like you no matter what curse you  had."  Akane said, warmly.</p><p>"Really?  It  doesn't bother you at all, not knowin' what gender I would be from one moment  to the next."</p><p>"No…I like both sides of you.  Your male side is strong and handsome…and  your female side is cute and a great friend for me.  Besides, its nice having two sparring partners for the price of one."</p><p>Ranma smiled at that last part.  "Thanks Akane.  We better try to get some sleep.   I still have to show Ryoga what I've learned."</p><p>"After Ryoga, I want my shot.  No holds barred."</p><p>"Yea…like you could even manage to hit me."</p><p>" I did a few days ago…remember?"</p><p>Ranma thought for a second.  "Oh yea…I guess I can't play around with you  any more."</p><p>"Nope…not any more…"</p><p>"Well, let's settle this tomorrow" Ranma said  yawning.</p><p>"Ok…good night Ranma."</p><p>"'Night Akane."</p><p>The couple, now relaxed, quickly fell asleep.  They weren't as nervous as they were in the  beginning, having received much needed answers from each other.  Those answers made them even more  comfortable with each other.</p><p><u>It…Begins!</u></p><p>Ranma was awoken late that night by a powerful blow  to his mouth.  His eyes popped open,  groggily searching for his attacker.  A  kick to his leg woke him up fully.</p><p>He sat up.</p><p>"Geeze…Ryoga wasn't kiddin' around."  Ranma said to himself, seeing Akane's hand  lying next to his pillow.  "I must have  let my guard down…maybe I was too relaxed."</p><p>Ranma shook Akane, waking her.</p><p>"Hey Akane…you need to chill out."  He said.</p><p>Akane sat up, her eyes still half closed.  "Huh…Oh!"   She exclaimed, seeing Ranma next to her.  "So this same bed thing wasn't a dream…"</p><p>"You were havin' a dream Akane?"</p><p>"Yea…it was me and you and our fathers had given us  the same bed to sleep in.  And then…"  Akane trailed off her words.</p><p>"And then what?" Ranma asked, interested.</p><p>"Oh…uh…nothing…"</p><p>"Oh come on Akane.   Nothin' could surprise me at this point in time."</p><p>"No don't worry about it Ranma."</p><p>"Oh…come one Akane.   Can't you trust me?"</p><p>"Well…if you must know…it's kinda embarrassing.  We were talking here…just like we are doing  now.  Then…out faces got closer together  and we kissed each other.  It was a  different sort of kiss…there was something like a fire around it.  Then…we…uh…you know…"</p><p>"Oh…so that's why you were actin' so restless a few  minutes ago.  You woke me up with a  punch and a kick."</p><p>"Yea…but the strange thing is…it felt so real…even  though I had never done anything like that.   I was really scared…at first."</p><p>Ranma and Akane sat there in silence for a few  moments.</p><p>"So…uh…who made the first move?"  Ranma asked, trying to avoid the awkwardness  of this situation.</p><p>"I was a kinda mutual thing…"</p><p>"Oh…" Ranma said.   They sat in the bed, looking at each other.  Their faces started to move closer to each other.  They both snapped out of their trance like  state before they had kissed.  Had that  kiss happened…</p><p>"Hey Ranma…I'm still a bit scared."  Akane admitted, sheepishly</p><p>"Yea…me too.   Maybe we should wait until we get married?"</p><p>"Yea…but…the thing is…I really don't wanna wait any  longer.  I'm scared, but… well I guess  it would be better to wait until we got married.  That way…nothing would get in our way."</p><p>Ranma thought to himself for a few minutes.  "Yea it would be better if we waited until  we were really married.  So…what do you  think about waiting until we get outta school for our wedding?"</p><p>"I guess I could wait for our marriage.  I kinda wanted to know what it feels like  though. If I <i>had</i> to wait…I would…"</p><p>A light turned on in Ranma's head.  They really didn't' have to wait for school  to end…</p><p>"So…if we were forced into it tomorrow…you would go  through with it?"</p><p>Akane gazed into the darkness.  "Yea…I suppose if it were forced on us…that  may not be such a bad idea after all…"</p><p>"I got an idea Akane!"  Ranma said</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Why don't we get married tomorrow!"</p><p>Akane widened her eyes.  "W-what? But…it's too soon for us.  What about school? What about everyone else?  What about…"</p><p>"Hey Akane…don't worry about all those  questions.  If two people are serious  about somethin', they can do anythin'."</p><p>"So…you really wanna to go through with  it…tomorrow?"</p><p>"Well yea…why not.   We love each other.  We are ready  for anythin'.  Besides…you said you  didn't want to wait anymore more for the wedding.</p><p>"But Ranma…this is so sudden…I…need a bit more  time."</p><p>"Oh come on Akane.   Will you marry me?"  Ranma asked,  taking Akane's hand.</p><p>A tear of joy squeezed out of Akane's eye.  She smiled, tears coming down her face.  This was for real…he really asked her.  How she had waited for those words.  Not quite how she imagined it, but it would  work.</p><p>"Of course I will, you big dummy!"  She said, giving him a big hug.  They sat in their bed, hugging each other,  Akane sobbing tears of happiness in Ranma's arms.</p><p>"Hey Akane…there's only one more problem…"</p><p>Akane looked up to him, concerned.  "W-what is that?"</p><p>"I don't think I can get back to sleep now…" Ranma  said, smiling nervously.</p><p>"Ranma!   Don't scare me like that!"  Akane  demanded.</p><p>"Oh…hey come on Akane…this <i>is</i> a pretty big  deal and all."</p><p>"Actually you're right…I don't feel the least bit  sleepy."</p><p>Ranma got up form the bed.  "Well…how 'bout some TV…you know…just until we get sleepy again."</p><p>Akane nodded, tears still in her eyes.  "Sure Ranma.  I'll fix us a midnight snack."</p><p>"Oh no you don't Akane."  Ranma said, smiling to her.   "I wanted to sleep…not die!"</p><p>"Whatever Ranma.   I'll have you know I've been working on a new cake recipe.  It will blow you away."  Akane said, still recovering from her shock.  The couple quietly went downstairs, turning on the TV.  </p><p>Eventually the two calmed down enough to go back to  sleep.  They eagerly awaited the next  day, and all the joy that would follow.   Nothing would get in their way…</p><p><u>Nothing  Except…</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane walked downstairs, having overslept  for breakfast.  They were so beaming  with happiness that Soun had to ask what was going on.</p><p>"My…you two seem to be in very good moods." Soun  indicated.</p><p>"Well yea…Dad…" Ranma said, smiling at Akane.</p><p>Soun's eyes began to fill with tears.  "D…dad…did you just call me dad?"</p><p>Genma stood up.   "Akane…is this true."</p><p>Akane nodded.   "Yes…father."</p><p>The two proud fathers looked at each other.  They ran to each other, hugging and crying  tears of joy.</p><p>"Me and Akane decided to get married…Tomorrow!"  Ranma said, triumphantly.  He had his arm around Akane's shoulder.</p><p>Everyone was mortally stunned at that  statement.  Silence was all that was  left of the people around the dinner table.</p><p>Ranma looked around for a few minutes.  "Hey…why is everyone all quiet and stuff?"</p><p>"Oh…I believe everyone is in shock Ranma."  Kasumi said, seeming to be the only one  immune.  "This is just wonderful.  I'll get started on that cake right  away.  Oh…before I forget Ranma.  You received a letter in the mail.  It's on the table on your seat."</p><p>Ranma went to examine the letter.  It was a bit thick.</p><p>"I wonder who this is from."  Ranma said, opening the letter.</p><p>"Watch it be from another Fiancée that Ranma  has."  Akane said dryly.</p><p>Genma shook his head frantically.</p><p>Ranma opened the letter; a few small pieces of paper  fell out.  He knelt down, picking them  up.  He examined them closely.  His eyes widened.</p><p>"Th…this is…unbelievable!"  He said, stunned.</p><p>"What…what is it Ranma!"  Akane asked, fearing the truth.</p><p>Ranma passed the small pieces of paper to  Akane.  She eyed over them.  Her jaw dropped and her eyes widened.</p><p>"This…this can't be …"</p><p>Everyone, their moods shattered, raced over to find  out what was on the little pieces of paper.   No doubt it would impact their wedding plans greatly…</p><p>*****Bwa ha ha! Did I say that was the last of the  cliffhangers? Oh…I didn't? Well, it's a good thing. Hehe. Now I know everyone  will just HAVE to read the next chapter. But dang…that's a hell of a cliffhanger;  even I'll admit that. Those of you that remember this story from it's first  posting may have noticed the lack of hints I've been giving. When I posted this  the first time, I always gave a glimpse of the next chapter. Not this time. But…I'll  just say this. A total of 21 chapters. We have much more story to go. I hope  everyone is having fun reading this! And…you'll be happy to know I'll be  working on getting my next fanfiction presentable. This one was too big, and  way too early in my writing career. <u>Just Give Me One More Chance</u> is, I believe  three of four months after this one. Because I toyed with a sequel to <u>Obsessions</u>,  and another Fanfic. That sequel has since become a non-sequel, called <u>Grateful  Days</u>. So I don't think I have a lot to do with that those. But…we shall  see. Until Next We Meet!*****</p>
