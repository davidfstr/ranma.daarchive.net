</div><p>Chapter two</p><p><u>Akane's</u><u>  plan</u></p><p>"Feh…" Ranma thought to himself.  "I hate studying, it's <i>so</i>  boring.  Come to think of it, school  doesn't really please me either. But I would hate to let these notes from Akane  go to waste though.  After all, I guess  I kinda owe it to her."</p><p>Ranma  looked across to his father, snoring loudly.   "Man, I can't study like this."   He continued, rising from the floor and heading towards the door.  He walked quietly downstairs to the dinner  table; the cold, wooden steps protesting about being used at such a late  time.  Ranma threw his papers on the  dining table, by passing it for the refrigerator.  He opened it up and looked inside.  A few pieces of the day's dinner were in there and what was left  of that special cake Kasumi had baked.   Ranma, realizing that he had left his piece in Akane's room, decided to  have a snack.  He sat down at the table  and tried to continue his studies; something that he really wasn't used to.</p><p>Akane  was trying to sleep, tossing and turning about.  She couldn't get that thought out of her head.  Where did it come from and when did it  happen?    Akane looked over to P-Chan,  tossing and turning almost as much as she was.</p><p>"Hey  P-Chan, sorry about keeping you awake."   She said; her smile highlighted by the moon and lights outside her  window.  "Come on P-Chan, let's go down  stairs and watch some TV."</p><p>With  that, Akane picked up P-Chan and took him down stairs, somehow hoping that the  TV would clear her mind.</p><p>As  she turned into the kitchen, she saw Ranma, sitting at the table with some  curious looking papers sitting in front of him.  The creaking floor again protested about being stepped on.  Ranma turned to the noise noticing Akane and  P-Chan were downstairs, looking at him shocked.</p><p>"Hey  Akane." Ranma said, "What are you doin' here?"</p><p>"Ranma!"  Akane gasped.  For some reason she  really didn't feel like seeing him at the present moment.</p><p>"What  Akane?"  He asked, surprised at her  outburst.  "Are you surprised that I was  actually studying?"</p><p>"Y…Yea…Ranma"  Akane said, trying to regain herself.   "I was just a bit shocked."</p><p>"Well  I figured you put a lot of time into making these copies for me, and after what  I did earlier today I guess I kinda owe it to ya."  Ranma said as-a-matter-of-factly.</p><p>"Don't  over do it Ranma, studying is more than just reading pieces of paper.  It's reflecting on what it means and its  value in the course you are in."</p><p>Ranma  looked at her, with a "what are you talkin' about" look.</p><p>"Ranma  you big dummy.  Here let me help you  out." Akane said, sitting beside him.   P-Chan suddenly wiggled out of Akane's grasp and disappeared.</p><p>"I  wonder what's gotten in to P-Chan?"</p><p>"Good  riddance I say." Ranma said, looking in the direction that P-Chan ran off to.</p><p>'You  two must really not like each other.   You really shouldn't be so jealous."</p><p>"<i>Jealous</i>?"  Ranma scoffed,  "Who would be jealous of a stupid black pig that gets lost on his  way from the kitchen to the stairs?"   Ranma said that last part louder, so "P-Chan" would get the message.</p><p>"He  does <i>not</i> get lost from the kitchen to the stairs!"</p><p>"Yea  it's because you carry him around all the time."  Ranma said under his breath.</p><p>Akane  narrowed her eyes "What did you say Ranma?"</p><p>"I  said…all this math is a crime.  Yea…I  can't stand all these equations.  What's  the point with doing 'em?  You'll never  use any of this stuff in the real world anyway."</p><p>"Well  <i>Ranma</i>, the point is that you need to pass <i>all</i> your classes to  graduate school.  That way you know  school is done forever and you wont have to worry about it after that."</p><p>"Yea…whatever  Akane, just show me what the deal is with all these X's and stuff."</p><p>Akane  obliged and started explaining an abstract concept to a "concrete" head.  A feat that proved more difficult than she  had thought.</p><p>Ranma  struggled with the complex ratios and such, Akane showing an unusual amount of  patience during the whole ordeal.  He  soon noticed that with each question, Akane was slowly sliding closer next to  him.</p><p>"I  wonder what Akane is up to?"  Ranma  thought to himself, completely ignoring her.   Akane was oblivious to this, her mind focused on helping Ranma.</p><p>"I'll  bet this is that "nice Akane" thing again." Ranma continued.  He soon found Akane leaning against him,  still going on about the math work.   Almost instinctively, Ranma placed an arm around Akane's shoulder, more  concentrating on what was happening than his studies.</p><p>"…and  that's how to solve that one Ranma."   Akane finished.  She soon noticed  what position she had found herself in.   It almost felt right, like this was how it was supposed to be.  "Hey Ranma, are you listening to me?" She  asked after evaluating the situation.   Ranma continued to stare into the paper.  Akane stuck an elbow into Ranma's side.  "Hey Ranma!  Wake up, its  not <i>that</i> late at night."</p><p>"Oh,  sorry Akane, I was just kinda comfortable…" Ranma trailed off his words, afraid  that Akane could go into one of her mood swings at any second.</p><p>"It's  ok Ranma, math <i>is </i>kind of boring and I've been noticing your lack of  sleep…at the Dojo any way."</p><p>Just  then, the stairs creaked again.  Ranma  and Akane separated quickly, afraid their fathers would see them actually  getting along.  They both looked back to  see Kasumi, in her nightclothes, coming down the stairs.</p><p>"Oh  My!"  Kasumi exclaimed.  "I hope I didn't ruin anything."</p><p>"No,  it's ok Kasumi." Akane said.  "Ranma and  I were just doing some studying for a math test we had tomorrow."  Ranma was a little upset about the ruined  moment but quickly forgot about it when he learned that the math test was  tomorrow.</p><p>"Oh  that's just wonderful!"  Kasumi said  cheerfully.  "I heard some voices down  here and I was wondering what was going on; just incase any one needed a  midnight snack.  Speaking of snacks, how  did you two like the cake I baked for you?"</p><p>"It  was really good Kasumi."  Ranma replied,  his slice of cake having long since disappeared.  Akane nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Good,  I'm so glad you two enjoyed it.  I was  afraid that the cake would have gone to waste with what happened earlier."</p><p>Ranma  and Akane looked at each other, in almost a manner as to start another  argument.  Kasumi noticed this and  continued, hoping to distract them from each other.</p><p>"Yes,  father will be overjoyed when he finds out you two have forgiven each other and  are starting to get along.  It's pretty  late now.  You two should think about  calling it a night."</p><p>Akane  looked over to a nearby clock.  It was  12:36 am.  She was with Ranma for almost  three hours.  "Yea Ranma, it's past  midnight.  Maybe we <i>should</i> call  it a night."</p><p>"Yea  I guess so Akane," Ranma said.  "I got  lucky yesterday, the teacher must have been real busy or somethin' to have not  sent me outside."</p><p>"Ok,  good night" Kasumi said, heading upstairs.   Ranma and Akane soon followed; saying good night to each other.</p><p>"Man,  what am I gonna do about that stupid test?"   Ranma thought to himself as he lay next to his father.  "I sure hope Akane knew what she was doing  back there.  I know I sure didn't.  What was with Akane any way?  I don't remember her being that nice  before."  Ranma thought to himself for a  few minutes.  He was determined to  figure out what was going on with Akane.   He started making a mental list of what she had done the past day.</p><p>"Lets  see here…" he continued.  "Akane was  acting nice for most of the day- almost too nice.  She seemed to want this engagement thing work.  Now why would Akane want this thing to  work?  Maybe she did love me and wanted  to go through it?  Nah.  That doesn't sound like Akane.  It has to be more sinister than that.  She must be doing this to get back at all  the other wanna-bes out there.  Yea…that  sounds just like Akane, going for revenge.   Maybe if they all see how much we're getting along, they would leave me  alone."</p><p>Ranma  turned on his side, satisfied that he finally figured something out without it  being beaten into him, literally.  He  soon fell asleep.</p><p>Akane  searched for P-Chan in her room, but it was in vain.  He had obviously gotten mad about her going near Ranma, almost  like he was trying to avoid him.  Akane  sat on her bed, thinking about what had just happened.  There was no denying her true feelings for  Ranma now.  The only other obstacle left  was to tell him how she felt.  Akane  pondered the right way to go about it.</p><p>"A  date tomorrow…" She thought to herself.   "That would be a perfect place to tell him.  I think he loves me too, so that would make it all the  easier.  I wonder how he will take  it."  Akane reached over to her lamp and  switched it off.  P-Chan would be fine,  its not like this was the first time he had done this.  Akane lie in her bed, her eyes adjusting to  the darkness.  She shook her head in  disgust as if trying to shake out these "new" feelings.</p><p>"I can't believe it."  She said to herself.  Akane fell asleep after a while, the moon  looking into her room, seeming to wonder what tomorrow would bring.</p>Humble Beginnings<p>Ranma  awoke unusually early for a school day.   The clock said it was 6:42 and school didn't start until 8:30 am.  Genma had already woke up a few minutes  earlier, no doubt playing Soun in yet another game of <i>GO</i>.  Ranma decided this would be a good time to  relax a bit and plan his next move, what with everything that had happened  yesterday.  He grabbed a towel and  headed to the bath.  A nice relaxing  bath would definitely help him concentrate; a skill that sometimes didn't come  easy.</p><p>"That  damn Kuno."  Ranma thought to himself,  as he sat down in the hot water.  Kuno's  sword had left a larger cut than he had previously though and the hot water did  not help matters.</p><p>"I  wonder if he's out of the hospital yet.   He should be, all it was were two broken ribs.  On second though, maybe I did lay a number on him, he might not  recover as fast as he usually does."   Ranma smiled to himself.  "Maybe  today I should pay him a visit earlier on today.  I'll bet he would be thrilled to death if "she" came to see  him.  Then I could <i>finally</i> try  and make him realize chasin' after me and Akane is just a waste of time."</p><p>Ranma  could smell breakfast cooking.  "Kasumi  sure did have a way with food.  She had  a way with a bunch of things, come to think of it.  The laundry was always done and dinner was always a joy."  A thought then crossed Ranma's mind.  "I can't go see Kuno, wearing my usual  clothes.  I gotta find a more reasonable  set of clothes, like a dress or something."   He shuddered at the though of wearing a dress for yet another occasion,  but if it would keep Kuno away, he would do it.  Satisfied, Ranma got out of the bath and started to get  dressed.  He would visit Kuno after  school.</p><p>The  sweet smell of pastries filled Akane's room, waking her up.  She looked around for a moment.  No P-Chan.   "I wonder if he ran away and got lost?"   Akane thought to herself, not halfway believing it.  Akane looked at her clock.  7:13.   She had just enough time for a real quick shower before breakfast was  served.  Akane proceeded to the shower,  half way wanting to check on Ranma, just to make sure he didn't have any plans  after school.  She opened the bathroom  door and found Ranma, who was up unusually early.  Akane instinctively covered her eyes.</p><p>"Hey  Akane, its ok.'' Ranma said.  Akane did  a double take; at least he had his shorts on.   It was then she noticed the wound Kuno had left.</p><p>"Ranma,  didn't that hurt?"</p><p>"What,  that little thing?  Nah. It only started  hurting when I got in the water."</p><p>"But  Ranma, it looks pretty deep from over here." Akane said, genuinely  concerned.  "You better let me have a  look a that."</p><p>Akane  went over to Ranma and examined the cut.</p><p>"See  Akane, its not that bad."</p><p>"Well  I guess not, but maybe you should let Kasumi patch it up for you."</p><p>"Nah,  I'll be fine. Besides, she's busy with breakfast and I would hate to worry  her."</p><p>"Suit  yourself Ranma, now if you'll excuse me I just wanna take a quick shower."</p><p>"Uh…sure  thing."</p><p>With  that, Ranma left Akane to her shower.   "Wow, that was such a change from all the yelling yesterday" Ranma  thought to himself, putting on his shirt and going down stairs.  "I sure could get used to this "New Akane."</p><p>Akane finished her shower just in time to eat  breakfast.  Everyone was sitting at the  table, enjoying their meal and noticing the "New Akane" was back.  Soun and Genma looked extremely pleased.</p><p>"I see Akane is back to normal now." Genma said,  normal meaning nice.</p><p>"Yes, after what happened yesterday, I would have  thought you two would still be mad at each other."  Soun said.</p><p>"Oh yes father, they made up last night while  studying." Kasumi added, cheerfully.   "They looked like such the perfect couple you would have thought they  were married already."</p><p>Ranma and Akane's faces started to turn red.</p><p>"I wonder what kind of studying they were doing last  night."  Nabiki said slyly, looking over  at Ranma</p><p>"Oh, I think it was for a math test, Nabiki." Kasumi  said, missing the innuendo.</p><p>"Yea, Akane," Nabiki continued, looking over at  her.  "What's one plus one equal?"  Akane's looked down into her plate,  blushing.  Ranma looked at her,  confused.</p><p>"Well everyone," Nabiki started, "I believe its time  for us to leave for school."  At those  words, Ranma and Akane got up and headed out the door, Nabiki following.  A car pulled up to the entrance of the  dojo.</p><p>"See you guys at school." she said, climbing  in.  "Oh, and Ranma, don't think I  forgot about what we talked about yesterday."   Ranma should have known better.   The car took off towards the school, leaving Ranma and Akane to walk  alone.</p><p>"What was she talking about, Ranma?"  Akane asked.</p><p>"Oh, it's…nothing Akane" Ranma returned, trying to  figure out how to get proper clothes while being 300 yen poorer.</p><p>"I wonder who that was in the car.  I would have thought that Kuno would be in  the hospital still, after the way you demolished him."</p><p>"I dunno, but you know how Nabiki is."  Ranma said simply, his mind obviously on  something else.</p><p>The two walked side by side, quietly.  Both thinking on what they should do after  school.  Akane was the first to break  the silence.</p><p>"Hey Ranma, " she said, looking over to him.  "What are you doing after school?"</p><p>"Oh, I have some unfinished business with Kuno.  I'm gonna visit him in the hospital.  It's about time for the final blow." He said  with a smile.</p><p>"You're not going to hurt him even more are  you?"  Akane asked, looking worried.</p><p>"Nah Akane, I'm just gonna go over there and let him  know that he's wasting his time with both of us."</p><p>"Oh…" Akane said, a bit disappointed.</p><p>Ranma looked over to her.  "Why did you ask?  Is  somethin' going on?"</p><p>"Well kinda…a thought had occurred to me yesterday  and I was wondering if…"</p><p>"Yea?"</p><p>Akane had not rehearsed asking Ranma out.</p><p>"Well…maybe you and I should go out to dinner tonight.  That way everyone would see how well we were  getting alone.  Who knows, maybe  everyone would leave us alone."  she  managed, offering Ranma a big smile.</p><p>Ranma thought for a moment, looking into the  sky.  "So it <i>was</i> for revenge and  not about love…but I thought that she…well there's still a chance she does. I  might as well help her.  After all, if  just one person got the message that would make my life a lot easier.  It would sure be nice to be with the "New  Akane" for a little while any way.  Just  me and her."</p><p>"Hey Ranma!"   Akane said, jumping in front of him, wearing a cute smile.  "So what do you think?"</p><p>"It's a date Akane!"  Ranma said, returning her smile.</p><p>"Good, now there's no getting out of this, so don't  stay too long "visiting" Kuno.  Now lets  hurry up, I don't wanna be late again."</p><p>The two ran off towards the school.</p><p>School went by fast for once; it had been a while  since both Akane and Ranma were in a good mood at the same time.  Everyone seemed to accept the fact that they  were indeed a good couple.  Having Kuno  absent made things even easier.  Ranma  even made an 83 on his math test, by far one of his best grades in that class.  Akane showed off her 94 to Ranma in the  lunchroom, playfully.</p><p>Soon the dismissal bell rang.  Ranma went outside to wait for Akane.  Instead, Nabiki greeted him.</p><p>"Oh man," He thought to himself, "Here goes my  300-yen."  Ranma reached into his pocket  just as Nabiki approached him.  He  handed it over, before Nabiki could make one of her remarks to him, or take any  more of his money.</p><p>"Thanks Ranma," She said, counting her money.  Nabiki winked at him.  "If you need anything else, like time at  home alone with Akane, you know who to call, right?  Of course its gonna cost a bit more…"</p><p>"Yea, sure thing Nabiki."  Ranma said in a manner to dismiss her.  "I'll keep you in mind."   Nabiki waved to him, her plan to get a few more yen foiled.  Better luck next time.</p><p>With Nabiki being carted off to the Dojo, Ranma was  free to contemplate about his up coming encounters.  "Maybe I should ask Nabiki for some money to by clothes? Nah,  getting money from her would be nearly impossible."</p><p>"Hey Ranma!   Ready to go?" Akane asked, surprising Ranma with her presence</p><p>"Huh?  Oh,  hey Akane, sure let's go, I've got a lot to do today"</p><p>"So do I" Akane thought to herself.</p><p>Ranma suddenly got an idea.  "Hey Akane, come over here.  I wanna ask you somethin'."  He said, waving Akane toward an empty  street.</p><p>"I wonder what he wants to ask me over there?"  Akane thought to herself, going over to  Ranma.  "I hope it's not about this date  coming up.  I just can't tell him how I  feel yet…I need to wait until later on, when the timing is right."</p><p>"Akane, what's with the serious look all of a  sudden?"</p><p>"Oh, I was…thinking about school."</p><p>"Sure, whatever Akane."</p><p>"Well, didn't you have something to ask me?"  Akane said, a bit annoyed</p><p>"Yea I do" Ranma said, checking to make sure no one  was listening to them  "Well, I need  to…borrow a cute dress to go see Kuno, He won't listen to male Ranma but he would  listen to female Ranma."</p><p>Akane looked relieved  "Oh, sure thing Ranma, I'll help you."</p><p>"Good, thanks Akane, I'm kinda in a bind for money  right now.  You know…this sure is cute  of you to help me like this."  Ranma  said with a big smile</p><p>Akane blushed at those words.  It was rare to hear the word  "cute" in a day, especially before the words  "un-cute" were said.</p><p>The couple walked down the street, quietly; Ranma,  planning what to say to Kuno and Akane planning on what to say to Ranma.  They soon reached to dojo, having  accomplished almost a full day without arguments.  Nabiki told Genma and Soun how well the two were getting  along.  The two proud fathers were  overjoyed, hugging their children upon their entry of the Dojo.</p><p>"Akane!" Soun said, eyes full of tears.  "I'm so happy for you.  You are trying so hard for your father.  You don't know how much that means to me and  to the Dojo.  Your mother would be  proud!"</p><p>"Yes, boy" Genma continued for Soun  "We are indeed very proud of you.  Not only will there be an heir for the dojo  now but many more heirs in the future."</p><p>"Oh Mr. Saotome, I'm so glad for you and  father."  Kasumi said, peeking out of  the kitchen.</p><p>Ranma and Akane were taken aback.</p><p>"H…Hey pops wait just a second."  Ranma said defensively.  "Just what do you mean by "many more heirs  in the future?"</p><p>"Grandchildren."   Genma said, smiling over to Soun. Soun nodded happily.</p><p>Ranma looked over to Akane, standing next to  him.  She turned her face away from him  in embarrassment, turning a bright red.</p><p>"Wha…What?"   Ranma said, at a loss for words.   Nabiki turned to him.</p><p>"Just say  the word Ranma, I'll even throw in a special first time discount."</p><p>Ranma just stood there.  Akane was still hiding.   "What are all you people talkin' about?"  Ranma demanded. "Why would anyone want to have a kid with such an  un-cute…." Ranma promptly bit his tongue, almost drawing blood.  Akane looked up to him, pleading with him  not to finish that sentence.</p><p>"Uh…yea, like I was sayin'…babies are so  un-cute.  You have to change them, they  wake you up at night, and they cause you all sorts of problems."</p><p>Everyone looked at Ranma suspiciously, Except  Kasumi, who smiled at Ranma's take on parenthood.  Akane looked up to him, offering a small smile.</p><p>"Well, dad" She continued  "Ranma and I have a lot of school work to do so we better go  ahead and get it done before dinner."</p><p>"Ok, Akane," Soun said to her, and with that, the  couple went upstairs.</p><p>"Man!", Ranma said, relieved.  "Pops and Mr. Tendou are taking this thing  way to far. Just because we decided to be nice is no reason to think we would…"  Ranma stopped there.  Akane met his  gaze.</p><p>They paused for a few moments.</p><p>"Well, Ranma, lets get you ready for your little  visit at the hospital, but we need to do one thing first."  She said, running into the bathroom and  returning with a small glass of water.</p><p>"Here we go again," Ranma thought to himself.  He could feel the cold sting of the water  against his face.</p><p>"There you go Ranma, <i>now</i> I can help you out."  Akane said, almost seeming to enjoy splashing him with the cold water.</p><p>"Yea, ok Akane."   The now female Ranma said.  "Lets  make this quick, I don't wanna spend any more time in a dress than I have to."</p><p>Akane made quick work, picking out a dress for  Ranma.  It was a green one, one Akane  had worn previously, but not so much as to be noticed on Ranma.  Ranma just stood by as Akane was saying  stuff like "lets try it like this" and "you should have your hair this way"</p><p>"Man, I've never seen this side of Akane  before.  She seems so…feminine.  So this is what the real Akane is  like."  Ranma thought to himself, not  paying attention to what Akane was saying.   Akane was oblivious to this, too engrossed in the task at hand.</p><p>"Ok, Ranma, I think that about does it."  Akane said, pushing Ranma towards her  mirror.  "What do you think?"  Ranma looked at himself…or herself  rather.  He did indeed look like a lady,  which was enough for him.</p><p>"Now if you would only wear the right underwear, you  would be a <i>real</i> lady."  Akane  said, playfully.</p><p>Ranma smiled to her.  "That ain't gonna happen Akane."</p><p>"Well Ranma, you're free to go.  Just promise me one thing."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Try not to hurt Kuno again.   It is so un-cute when you do that."</p><p>Ranma narrowed her eyes at Akane for using his  favorite line.  "Sorry Akane, sometimes  I just get kind of defensive when people try to steal things."</p><p>Akane had not heard that line before.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll be back in time for dinner.  Wish me luck with Kuno."</p><p>"Good luck Ranma."</p><p>Ranma started down the stairs.</p><p>"Oh, wait Ranma!"   Akane said, chasing after her.   "Where did you want to go for dinner?"</p><p>There was only one place Ranma wanted to go to.</p><p>"Lets go to "Uc-chan's!" He said, his mind on  Okonomiyaki<i>.</i></p><p>Akane should have known the answer to that, but  hoped against hope that he would choose a different place.  "This is going to put a damper on my  plan."  Akane thought to herself.  "<i>Actually</i> this might be a good  idea.  If Ukyo were to see us getting  along, she might just stop bothering Ranma.   In reality, this is the perfect way.   I'll tell him how I feel right in front of Ukyo.  She would surely tell the others what had  happened."</p><p>"Yea, Ranma, that would be the prefect place to  go!"  She said, with an unusually big  smile.</p><p>"Ok Akane, see ya around."</p><p>Ranma went down the steps and started towards the  hospital, Dress and all.</p><p>Akane returned to her room to take a quick nap.  She had a lot on her mind.  "I can't believe I'm doing this."  She said to herself.  "I don't think I can tell him how I feel,  but I have to, I owe it to my family and Mr. Saotome.  They will probably make a big deal about it as usual."  Akane chuckled to herself.  "There's no turning back now, I would hate  to be miserable like this for the rest of my life.  I don't feel like eating, even though my stomach says  otherwise.  My mind is constantly  wandering, almost to the point I get dizzy.   I'll tell him how I feel, I don't care what happens after, just as long  as things go back to normal, as if the word normal could be used after tonight."  Akane, relaxed for the first time in what  seemed like forever and quickly fell asleep.</p><p>Ranma approached the hospital.  "Ok Ranma, time to turn on that female  charm" she said to herself.  She  approached the front desk.</p><p>"Umm…excuse me mister.  Could you please tell me where Tatewaki Kuno's room is?" She  asked in an almost overly cute tone.   The gentlemen at the desk looked up and smiled.  "Sure thing pretty lady.  Mr. Kuno is on the second floor in room  eleven."</p><p>"Ok, thanks mister!"  With that, she headed off towards his room.</p><p>Ranma easily found the room number eleven, it was  the only one on the left side of the hall way on this segment on wall, the  other rooms appeared to be storage spaces or nurses' lounges.  Ranma readied herself.  "Ok Ranma, here we go.  Be gentle.   Don't act like you know what happened."   She said to herself, knocking on the door.</p><p>The door opened slowly, revealing Kodachi of all  people.  "Good, maybe I can kill two  birds with one stone today."  Ranma  thought.</p><p>"Is Kuno-sempai in here?"</p><p>"Yes he is."   Kodachi said, probably still bitter about losing that martial arts  gymnastics thing.</p><p>Ranma burst in, heading for Kuno, who was sitting up  in bed, concentrating on something.   "Kuno-sempai!"  She called, "I  was so worried about you!"</p><p>"Oh, My pig-tailed goddess!"  Kuno said, turning to her.  "You…you mustn't see me like this!"</p><p>Ranma placed a big hug on Kuno, fully knowing what  his condition was.  Kuno yelped in pain  and Ranma backed up, stricken.</p><p>"Kuno-sempai, what's wrong?  Don't you want to see me?  I heard that you got hurt so I ran here as  fast as I could."</p><p>"Alas, Why did the God's bequeath this unspeakable  evil upon me?  For, I, Tatewaki Kuno,  the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High, am unable to return your gesture of love, my  beloved Pig-tailed goddess."</p><p>"Kuno-sempai?   Do you mean that you don't like me any more?"</p><p>"No, that's not it:   A great evil descended upon me a few days ago.  His name was Ranma Saotome.   He hath smited me upon the battlefield, for I was fighting for my true  love, Akane Tendou."</p><p>Ranma feigned extreme sadness.  "But…Kuno-sempai, I thought you loved <i>me</i>."</p><p>"Worry not, my pig-tailed goddess, there is plenty  of room in Kuno's heart for the both of you."</p><p>"But Kuno sempai…I want to be the only one in your  heart."</p><p>Kuno looked stunned at Ranma's words.  "Such a foul deed does rest upon my  shoulders.  I must decide on which  female will date with me."</p><p>"Kuno sempai.   I can't stand the thought of you leaving me.  Please make your decision now.   I need to know how you feel."</p><p>Kuno thought for a moment, ever pondering whom he  would choose.</p><p>"I choose <i>both</i> of you!"  Kuno said, getting up and hugging his  "goddess."  He yelped in pain  again.  "Alas, the pain I have felt is  nothing to the pain in my heart, hearing those words from you.  I wish you to leave.  You cannot see your brave knight in shining  armor like this.  It would surely scar  you for life."</p><p>"But Kuno sempai…"</p><p>"Be brave, my goddess.  Your champion shall arise again to confront Ranma Saotome.  At which point I shall date both you and  Akane Tendou."</p><p>"You will not touch my Ranma-sama!"  Kodachi shouted, having heard enough about  revenge on Ranma.</p><p>"Such a twisted sister I am forced to dwell  with…  My pig-tailed goddess, please be  brave, for my sake.  Now go from here,  its is hurtful to your champion to look upon your soft features and not be able  to take them into my arms."</p><p>"When will you challenge Ranma?"</p><p>"The very day I am completely healed, my  beloved.  Now go. Please, and forget the  Kuno sitting before you.  Only remember  the tall, strong Kuno, whom has defended you."</p><p>"Aren't you just wasting your time with Ranma and  Akane?  Why not come after me instead of  those two.  I would hate to see you get  hurt again, I can barely take hospitals at all, especially when <i>you</i> are  inside."</p><p>"Please, your champion's mind is hard working on  what he must do.  He needs time to think  about his situation."</p><p>"But Kuno-sempai… I will leave you be if that is  what you want.  I shall return to you  Kuno-sempai, until then, farewell."   Ranma said, dashing out the door, forcing a few tears just to add  effect.  She ran all the way to the  elevator, a few people looking strangely at her.  She got in the elevator, and, sure that no one would see her, let  her farce down.  She exited the elevator  in high spirits, once again smiling to the gentleman that helped her.</p><p>"Excuse me again mister.  When is Tatewaki Kuno going to be released?"</p><p>"Oh hi there, young lady!  Lets see here…Tomorrow morning looks like the time he will be  discharged."</p><p>"How long would it take him before he could fight  again?"</p><p>"I would say about a month or so, depending on what  kind of rest he gets and what he eats."</p><p>"Ok! Thanks mister!"  Ranma said, playfully turning around and running out the door.</p><p>Ranma just then bumped into Kodachi, whom was  holding a gift-wrapped box.  "Hey, you  know my beloved Ranma-sama do you not?"</p><p>Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Please give this gift of home baked cookies to  him.  Tell him I will see him later,  after he has finished all of them."</p><p>"Ok Kodachi…" Ranma said suspiciously.  Kodachi bounded off, laughing to herself and  everyone near by.</p><p>Ranma started back to the Dojo, unwrapping the  cookies and taking one out.  She sniffed  one of the cookies.  "It smells normal…I  better not take any chances, given Kodachi's track record.  I would hate to miss dinner with Akane over  a stupid cookie." She thought, throwing the box in a near by trashcan.</p><p>"So what if that didn't go exactly as I had  planned.  One month away from Kuno is  enough time." Ranma continued.  "It will  prolly be more like two weeks.  Oh well,  me and Akane might be married by then so I shouldn't worry about it."  Ranma stopped dead in her tracks.  She had done it again, admitting what her  feelings were.  "I…I shouldn't worry  about me and Akane right now."  She  finally concluded.  "I have to  concentrate on getting rid of all those freeloaders.  Besides, that's what Akane really wants.  Dealing with Shampoo and Cologne is gonna be  hard. I'll worry about those two later, in the mean time I need to take a  shower so I can be ready for dinner."   Having cleared her mind again, Ranma raced off to the Dojo, ready for  anything that lie ahead of him.  Almost  anything…</p><p><u>Little  Date</u></p><p>Akane awoke just as Ranma entered to dojo. Soun and  Genma seemed to be eternally locked in a game of <i>GO</i>.  Kasumi was preparing dinner, in her usual  cheerful manner.  Nabiki was sitting at  the table, abacus in hand, figuring out who knows what about her finances.</p><p>"Oh, Hello Ranma" Kasumi said, coming out of the  kitchen.  Nabiki did not look up from  her work.</p><p>"Hey Kasumi."   Ranma said simply, looking around for Akane.</p><p>"I hope you will enjoy dinner, it's a new recipe for  ramen I found in mother's notebook."</p><p>"I'm sorry Kasumi, but me and Akane are gonna go out  for dinner tonight, I thought she would have told everyone by now."</p><p>"No Ranma, Akane did not even stay awake long enough  for her to tell us.  As soon as you left  she went straight to take a nap.  I hope  everything is ok."</p><p>"Yea, I think everything is fine, she might have not  slept well last night, seeing as we stayed up so late.  Especially with that math test and all.  I hope you understand Kasumi, I hate to miss  your cooking."</p><p>"Oh no Ranma, please go out and have a wonderful  time!  After all, you two should start  doing this kind of thing if you're to be wed."   Kasumi said, smiling.</p><p>"Ok, thanks a lot Kasumi. Is Akane awake yet?"</p><p>"Oh, I don't think so.  Maybe you should go check on her."</p><p>"Ok" and Ranma started up the stairs, glancing at  Soun and Genma.</p><p>"This is wonderful news, huh Saotome?"  Soun said, on the verge of tears.</p><p>"Indeed it is, Tendou.  We should have known better than to think a mere argument could  get in the way of true love."</p><p>Ranma ignored this latest round of praise and headed  to Akane's room.  She approached to door  tentatively, afraid to wake her.  On  second though it was Akane that wanted this "date" thing.  Ranma knocked softly on Akane's door.  "Hey Akane!   You awake in there?"  She said,  in a low voice.</p><p>Akane stirred about.  "Hmm?  Oh! Ranma! I almost  over slept."  She said, opening the  door.  She had obviously been sleeping  for a few hours.</p><p>"Well, I talked to Kuno, I think I bought us two  weeks at the most, but with Kuno I guess you take what you can get."</p><p>"Well, at least you tried.  Hey shouldn't you take a shower first.  You can't be seen with another girl going on a date.  That's just kinda weird."</p><p>"Speaking of weird, you should look at your  hair."  Ranma said playfully</p><p>"Oh stop it Ranma, even though you're a girl now you  have no idea what its like to deal with hair."</p><p>"I know enough to know when someone has bed hair."</p><p>"Ok Ranma, you go take a shower, and I'll get ready"</p><p>"Ok."  Ranma  said.  She entered the bathroom, and,  deciding that Akane would need a few more minutes, started a nice, warm bath.</p><p>Akane went to her closet.  "I have to pick a really cute dress for such a special  occasion."  She thought.  She looked around for a few minutes,  deciding on a nice blue dress she had worn a few weeks before. Her  favorite.  She put it on and looked at  herself in her mirror.  Ranma would  surely like this dress.  She then began  to work on her hair.  It was a good  thing it was short, as it only took a few minutes to straighten out.  All that was left to do was wait for Ranma  now.</p><p>Ranma, now male, put on his usual clothes and  knocked on Akane's door.  The door  opened, revealing a very cute Akane, smiling broadly.</p><p>"Wow, Akane, you look pretty cute in that dress…"  Ranma said, gazing upon her.</p><p>"Thanks Ranma, I um… picked it just for you."  Akane said, rather sheepishly, her eyes  going up to Ranma's.  They stood,  staring into each other's eyes for a few moments.  Ranma was the first to speak.</p><p>"Ok, Akane let's go."  He said with a smile, taking Akane's hand and leading her out the  dojo.  Their fathers said something, but  neither of the two paid much attention.</p><p>"So what did Kuno say?"  Akane asked.</p><p>"Well, Kuno said that he would challenge me as soon  as his wounds heal."</p><p>"And when is that?</p><p>"About a month from now is what the doctor  said.  But remember, this is Kuno, so  it's more like two weeks, give or take whether it's a Friday."</p><p>"How did he take your arrival?"</p><p>""Oh! My pig tailed goddess! Please don't hurt  yourself by looking upon my broken body" or somethin' like that, I really  wasn't payin' attention."</p><p>"Yea Ranma, you were never one much with details,  were you?"</p><p>"Nah, details annoy me, so do wanna be fiancées that  keep pestering me."</p><p>"Yea, it must be tough trying to defend yourself from  all those attacks" Akane said trying to be sympathetic.</p><p>"Yea, it was rough dealing with Kodachi's poisons,  Ukyo's spatulas, and Shampoo's great-grandmother.  Shampoo also tried a bit of food lacing if I remember  correctly.  Then you would always hit me  when they tried to capture me.  It was a  bit stressful, but I think things are gonna…" Ranma realized he slipped his  tongue again.  The last thing he wanted  to do was make Akane angry and reverse all the effort she put into her new  attitude.  He looked down to her, ,  Akane looking up to him with a smile, seeming to hang on his every word.</p><p>"Things are gonna what?"  She asked, curious.</p><p>"Oh, Uh…things are gonna get better, I've made up my  mind to get rid of all these people so I can finally relax."</p><p>"Well, good luck Ranma, you're gonna need it."  Akane said.</p><p>The couple soon entered Uc-chan's, with Ukyo serving  up various Okonomiyaki<i>.  </i>"Hey  Ran-Chan, what can I get for you?"  Ukyo  said, happy to see her love.</p><p>"Can I have a shrimp Okonomiyaki?"  Ranma asked, his mouth starting to water.</p><p>"Sugar, you can have any thing you want!"  Ukyo returned, flipping a previous order.</p><p>"Could you make that two Ukyo?"  Akane asked, seeming un-moved by Ukyo's  words.</p><p>Ukyo looked up to see Ranma was indeed holding the  hand of Akane Tendou.  "This can't be a  good sign for my Ran-Chan."  She thought.</p><p>"Sure Akane, anything for Ranma's friend!"  Ukyo said, with a dash of sarcasm.</p><p>Ranma got his usual seat and Akane across him.  The two soon engaged in what could be called  a conversation, almost like normal a couple.</p><p>"We don't have any more tests to study for over the  weekend, do we?"  Ranma asked, a bit  concerned</p><p>Akane thought for a moment.  "No, I didn't hear of one.  Besides, today is Friday.  Its not too common for teachers to assign a  test for Monday."</p><p>The conversation about school continued, as Ukyo  observed the two, between Okonomiyaki flippings.</p><p>"Something…is different about those two."  She thought to herself, cooking as though it  were second nature.  She noticed Ranma  seemed to concentrate more on what Akane was saying than he usually did.  Akane seemed to lean ever closer to him,  wearing that cute smile of hers.  "I  wonder what's up with those two.  Could  they actually be getting along for once?   Could this be a <i>date</i> for them?"</p><p>Ukyo went over to their table, with the <i>Okonomiyaki</i>.  She set them down in front of the  couple.  "There you go Ran-Chan, I hope  you enjoy this."</p><p>"Oh I sure will Uc-Chan!"  Ranma said, his eyes getting bigger at the sight of the shrimp  Okonomiyaki.  The couple ate quietly,  throwing in a comment the likes of "Ukyo did a great job", and "This is very  good"</p><p>Ranma finished his first.  "Hey Uc-Chan can I get another one?"</p><p>Akane took a deep breath.  "Ok Akane, this is it."   She thought to herself.  "This is  what the everything comes down to."   Akane noticed that her palms started sweating and she was shaking all  over.  "Ugh, come on Akane, you've faced  bigger challenges than this.  Remember  all the fights you used to get into, the fights you had with Ranma…then why is  this so…hard.  I <i>have</i> to do this,  for my father <i>and</i> mother.  What  would everyone think if I chickened out now?   I have to do this.  Dad put all  his trust into <i>me</i> carrying on the dojo.   And even if Ranma doesn't like what he hears, at least I'll have tried  my best."  Akane wiped her hands on her  dress, and took a sip of her water.  Now  her throat was starting to dry and she suddenly lost her appetite.  Ranma was looking over at the hot grill,  watching Ukyo show off her cooking skills.   "The <i>Okonomiyaki</i> is almost ready" Akane continued to think to  herself.  "Here I go!"</p><p>Ukyo noticed that Akane had become very tense.  "What's up with her?"  She thought.</p><p>"H…Hey Ranma?"   Akane forced herself to say.</p><p>Ranma turned around, obviously in a good mood.  "Yea Akane?"</p><p>"I…Uh…Well I…"</p><p>"Is something wrong Akane?  You seem a bit distracted all of a sudden."</p><p>"Well…it's just that I've…en…enjoyed spending time  with you.  Its been really fun these  past couple of hours and…I uh…wanted to… tell you something"</p><p>Akane was starting to falter.</p><p>"Man, Akane is sure acting weird." Ukyo continued to  herself.  Perplexed, she "turned on" her  feminine intuition and did a double take on what was happening to Akane.  She looked at Akane, hands nervously  fidgeting and her eyes were looking down, like she was in deep thought.</p><p>Suddenly it hit her, making her drop one of her  spatulas.</p><p>"<i>Oh…My…God</i>!"  Ukyo said to herself, stunned at her  revelation.  "Akane Tendou is about to  tell Ranma that she <i>loves</i> him!"   Panic started to set in Ukyo's heart as she stared in disbelief.  "Oh no, what does this mean for my  Ran-Chan!"  Her heart started to race,  panic in full swing.  "I…I have to stop  her or I'll lose my Ran-Chan forever!"   Ukyo's mind went in a thousand different directions.  She had to stop this exchange, for her  sake.  She didn't know what to do.</p><p>The walk to Ranma and Akane's table seemed to take  hours.  Ukyo thought desperately, trying  to stop Akane.  What had Shampoo and the  others done at this moment?</p><p>"What did you want to say Akane?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>Akane  looked into Ranma's eyes. "Well…I…I…"</p><p>Ukyo burst in   "Wasn't that Okonomiyakithe best you've ever had Ran-Chan?"  Akane looked like she had been hit with a  real fist, she looked down at her plate, defeated.</p><p>"It sure was Uc-Chan," Ranma said, turning his  attention to what Ukyo carried.</p><p>"Now for the final blow!" Ukyo thought to herself,  noticing that Akane had been defeated.</p><p>"Oh Ranma! I'm so glad you liked it, you have no  idea how much that means to me!"  She  said, grabbing the sitting Ranma and giving him a little kiss.  Ukyo turned to Akane with a slight  smile.  Akane was seething, gripping her  glass of water in a manner to have almost shattered it.</p><p>"Hey Uc-chan!   What was that for?  You know I…"  Ranma turned to the other side of the table.   He now stared death in the face.   Her name was Akane.  Her eyes  were narrowed, her teeth clenched and her eyes were actually on fire.  Both Ranma and Ukyo backed up.  Akane was serious this time.</p><p>"What…what have I done?"  Ukyo thought to herself, about to regret ever serving that  Okonomiyaki<i>.</i></p><p>"<i>You…you…Damn Jerk</i>!"  Akane shouted, throwing her chair  backwards.  Everyone in the restaurant  could feel the pain and anger in those words.   "<i>What the hell are you doing</i>!"</p><p>"H…Hey, wait just a second Akane, I…I didn't…" Ranma  tried.</p><p>"I ask you out to a nice dinner and <i>this</i> is  how you repay me?  I was even gonna pay  for the meal.  But no, you just had to  go screw it up like everything else you touch."</p><p>Ranma got defensive.  "Wait a second Akane!" he yelled, getting to his feet.  "If you weren't so un-cute you would have  realized…"</p><p>Akane cut him off, furious "<i>Un-Cute?</i> <i>Un-cute</i>! I'll show you Un-cute!"  She said, dousing Ranma with her water.</p><p>"Damn it Akane!   Why wont you listen to me?"  The  now female Ranma demanded.</p><p>"Oh, and I suppose she forced you into that  kiss.  She stuck a knife to your throat  and threatened to kill you if you didn't give her a kiss.  Is that it?   Just like all those other times with Shampoo and Kodachi."</p><p>"Yes! I mean no…"</p><p>"You know Ranma, sometimes you make me so mad I  could just <i>kill</i> you!"</p><p>"Oh yea, like <i>that</i> ever stopped you  before.  You always hit me for no reason  and then complain about what I did?  No  Akane! That's not gonna work this time.   You saw with your own eyes what happened."</p><p>"Yea you're damn right I saw what happened.  I saw you kiss Ukyo.  Does that ring a bell up there Ranma or do  you want me to draw you a picture?"   Akane shouted back.</p><p>"Damn!  You  can be <i>so</i> un-cute sometimes, and here I was thinkin' you had changed. I  almost fell for it this time.  Guess I  shoulda known better than that huh?"</p><p>"I <i>did</i> change but <i>you</i> had to keep  screwing up.  <i>That's</i> why I'm so  mad at you!"</p><p>"No you didn't change.  You're still the same old, stupid, sexless tomboyish Akane as you  were when I first met you!"  Ranma yelled,  his anger way passed its breaking point.</p><p>Akane was stunned.   She could feel the tears beginning.   "Oh…oh yea? Well…well…you're still the same perverted jerk you were when  you first came to the Dojo!"</p><p>"You know, Akane, I wish I had never met you!  All you do is complain about what <i>I</i>  do then hit me over it, like <i>you're</i> some kind of angel or  somethin'.  Well this time its over! <i>I</i> <i>never</i> <i>want to see you again</i>!"</p><p>Akane's whole world fell in on itself after those  words.  The man she loved just said he  didn't return her feelings.  Akane's  anger turned into a bitter rage, her fist was clenched so tight her she lost  feeling in that hand.  She unleashed her  rage in a solid blow to Ranma's cheek, actually knocking her a few feet  backward.  Ranma flew back and landed  behind Ukyo, whom was speechless.</p><p>"<i>Fine</i>!   If that's the way you want it Ranma!" Akane said, tears in her  eyes.  She burst out the door and ran  back to her room at the Dojo, stunning everyone there.  The slamming door indicated that she really  didn't feel like talking.</p><p>Ukyo just blinked, at a complete loss for  words.  "What…what just happened?" she  asked herself.  She then noticed Ranma  was now behind her.  She turned and  offered her a hand.</p><p>Ranma lay on the floor, rubbing her face.  The fist had almost cut to the bone.  She looked up at Ukyo who was offing a hand  to her.  Ranma looked into Ukyo's eyes,  with a look that cut through her very soul.   Ukyo was decimated.  Ranma,  ignoring the kind gesture, rose to her feet and started back to the dojo.  No use putting off the inevitable.</p><p>All that was left of Ukyo stood at Ranma's favorite  table, in front of tragedy.  Tears  started to form in her eyes…something that she had not felt in a while.</p><p>"What have I done?"   She couldn't get that thought out of her head.  "All I wanted was my Ran-Chan.   I…I didn't mean to hurt Akane like that."  Ukyo realized that Ranma wasn't her "Ran-Chan" any more.  His heart belonged to another.</p><p>"Please everyone.   This shop will close early.  I'm  very sorry about all this.  You may  return tomorrow for a free Okonomiyaki<i>."   </i>The few people that were left obliged, and left Ukyo to her sorrow.</p><p>"What have I done?"</p><p>Ukyo collapsed in a heap on the floor, sobbing.  "I have hurt my friend Akane and worse of  all, I have hurt my beloved Ran-Chan.   Ukyo you idiot, that wasn't you back there.  That was a…demon.  If you  really loved Ranma you wouldn't have done that!"  She said to herself, words unable to express her sorrow for what <i>she</i>  had caused.</p><p>Ranma entered the Dojo, all eyes on her.  "Ranma!" Soun shouted.  "What did you do to my Akane?"</p><p>Ranma shot a death glare at him  "It's what <i>she</i> did to me!"  She yelled, going upstairs and into the  shower.</p><p>Akane was in her room sobbing.  P-Chan had finally found his way back into  Akane's room after wandering the Dojo for hours.</p><p>"Oh, P-Chan!"   Akane said, hugging him quite hard.   "I was about to tell Ranma that I loved him when he went and ruined <i>everything</i>  with that stupid Ukyo!"  P-Chan was  stunned.  Had he missed something while  he was lost?  "I had planned everything  perfectly but that damn jerk still found a way to screw up.  P-Chan…He…he…said he never wanted to see me  again!"  Akane was devastated, sobbing  into P-Chan's, warm, soft body; the only comfort she could get.</p><p>P-Chan had about as much as he could stand from  Ranma.  He looked up at the pitiful  sight, his eyes could barely watch.   Sadness and rage had a firm grip on Akane.  That rage soon gripped P-Chan</p><p>"Don't worry Akane, Ranma will never hurt you like  that again.  He <i>shall</i> be punished  for doing this to you.  Your P-Chan  guarantees this."  Ryoga thought to  himself.  "It is time he learn the hard  way how to treat you, my beloved."   Ryoga waited for an hour or so, Akane had cried herself to sleep.  Ranma was in the training hall, furiously  working off his anger.  Everyone else,  not knowing what they could do, simply went to bed.  Ryoga went into the shower, and started to the hall to confront  Ranma.</p><p>***** So, there's  Chapter Two. Now things are starting to heat up. And just so you all know, I passed  my audit! Yay! I got a 1% error  margin I think I'm allowed up to 2% but still, that's kinda in the middle. Oh  well. Oh, and I'm so happy! Everyone still remembers me!  And it's nice to see some new faces too. I  look forward to a few more. But for now, that's it. I'll try to update this  thing whenever I get a free moment, but I can't guarantee they will be as prompt  as the first posting. So, until next we meet! And yes, mighty Denkou-dono. I  will be posting my other stories. I hope they do as good as Obsessions did  :D:D:D******</p>
