</div>                ***Just a note. All characters belong to the great  and wondrous Rumiko Takahashi-sama. I only hope to do her creative mind justice  with this little story here.***<p>*****Well. Guess who's back? It's me, Elidibus. A  few of you may recognize this story as the first one I ever published on .  If not, you're in for a real treat I think. During the past few months, I've  been pursuing my goals of becoming a professional writer. I just finished my  first original story, and am in the process of editing. I've been wrestling  with the thought of posting again on  for about that long as well. But…If  I'm to become an author, I must get used to criticism…you know. I really don't  like doing this…in fact; I'd rather not post…but hey. Even if everyone flames  my first chapter, it would still be a better day than I had today. I just found  out I may have failed my Quarterly audit. It's not good seeing the third most  powerful guy in your company looking around for errors. So I thought, screw it.  I'll just go ahead and post this. I do have the first set of reviews, and I  calculated it at 95% approval. I got about 5 flames out of 100 reviews. (Flames  that had criticism that was justified counted as positive reviews) I figure  that's pretty good. I have since edited this story about three times. I hope it's  even better than before!</p><p>And  another thing. These little notes tend to get long winded, but will normally  appear at the bottom. I would like you to read them, but I can't make you. They  do tend to answer a lot of questions, however.</p><p>And  just a bit of history. I pulled this story rather quickly, having found an  opportunity to publish it in a real magazine. That has since fallen apart due  to a bunch of stuff that I really don't care about. Now I know of at least 5  people that wondered what happened because they missed the ending. It is my  hope that those people will stumble on this and enjoy. And I hope you too  enjoy. If you like it, by all means, leave a good review. Think it's unoriginal  or any number of other complaints I got on the first posting, flame me. At this  point, I don't care…well actually I do. I tend to get a bit nervous with stuff  like this. But if you do flame me, at least leave an email addy, so I can have  fun too!</p><p>Ok…enough  of this from the author crap. People wanted it, so here it is. I sincerely hope  you enjoy this story, and constructive criticism is appreciated, as is anything  else you feel like leaving. I gotta get used to this kinda stuff, ya know?</p><p>So…without  further ado, I present <u>Obsessions</u>!</p><p>(Oh,  and forgive the lousy formatting. It looks a lot better on my actual documents,  and most things are underlined and stuff. Somehow, I can't seem to get it to do  right. Any suggestions and you could email me or something.)</p><p>Enjoy!</p>Obsessions:<p>Brought to you by:</p><p>Elidibus</p>Chapter One:    Revelations<p>It's  nighttime at the Tendou Dojo.  A few  days have passed since the fiasco of a weeding and things have returned pretty  much back to normal.  Soun and Genma  still expect a weeding in the near future but Ranma must dissolve all of his  relationships before another wedding can take place.  Easier said than done…</p><p>Ranma  lay awake in his room staring at the ceiling, thinking back to that day.</p><p>"What  if Akane had not woken up from the brink of death?  What if I had actually told her how I felt?  What if the wedding had actually  happened?  She <i>was</i> pretty cute in  that wedding dress…too bad all those people had to show up and ruin  everything…what in the world was Nabiki thinking when she invited all those  people?  She was probably thinking of  yen.  I wonder what Akane was thinking  through all that?  Would she have said,  "I do?"  What did she mean by saying "  we didn't have to be forced into this but I would be sorry if I didn't marry  her?"</p><p>Ranma  suddenly got a bit tense.</p><p>"What could that un-cute tomboy do  to me anyway?  She prolly would have  hammered me again, and then we would start arguing again, just what all those  wedding crashers wanted.  Yea that made  me a bit mad.  Actually, it really  pissed me off how everyone was acting so stupid; as if I was gonna get together  with any of them in the first place.   And I also have the three stooges to deal with.  Yea Mr. Tendou was right.  Maybe I <i>should</i> start dissolving all  those one-way relationships…that way me and Akane can…"</p><p>Ranma trailed off his thoughts, not  wanting to admit his true feelings again, even if it was to himself.</p><p>"Well, I better try to get to sleep, I hate holding those buckets  in the hallway; it's like an accident waiting to happen.  Too bad pops always snores so loud."</p><p>Ranma  turned on his side and tried to put the snores of his old man out of his mind,  his thoughts wandering on all the people around him he would eventually have to  confront.</p><p>Akane, lying sleeplessly on her bed, is also  thinking to herself, P-Chan sleeping next to her.</p><p>"That  Ranma…why did he have to go and ruin that day?   If it weren't for all those wanna-bes who can't accept fate, Ranma and I  could have…well it's not like it was <i>my</i> idea to marry him.  Two stupid fathers are to blame for  that.  Well one in particular with his  stupid promises.  I wonder if Ranma  would have gone though with it?  Well I  guess he practically said "yes" when he saved my life back in China."</p><p>Akane  sighed to herself, rolling on her back.</p><p>"I  was so sure of our feelings back on that day…but now I'm not so sure.  Maybe I was mistaken.  That stupid pervert, why can't he ever tell  the truth?  True. our fathers had to  knock him out to dress him for the wedding.   Did that mean that he <i>didn't</i> want to get married?  Well which is it Ranma?  Either love me or hate me, you can't have it  both ways."</p><p>P-Chan  stirred about, changing positions on Akane's bed.  Akane looked over at him, seeing only a black silhouette  highlighted by the moon and the few stars that were out that night.</p><p>"I  wonder why P-Chan has been acting so distant lately?  Come to think of it, he started acting that way the day that we  almost got married.  It's like I try to  talk to him and he runs away.  He  finally started coming back to his senses about a day ago.  I wonder how P-Chan feels about Ranma and  I?  He doesn't seem to like Ranma that  much.  He might take it kind of hard if  we <i>did</i> go through all of this wedding business. "</p><p>Akane  let out a soft sigh, realizing what she was doing.</p><p>"I'm  just going in circles.  What if Ranma  really does love me?  Maybe he's just  scared…I know I sure was, not that he noticed or anything.  That stupid Ranma, always acting so calm and  collected, especially when his concubines show up.  Always hanging off of him like we was some sort hero or  something, and always acting so nice to him."</p><p>Akane  paused for a minute, thinking on what she just said to herself.  She turned her head and looked outside her  window.  A few streetlights were on and  there was that ever-present moon, presiding over all the lights that went about  the city.</p><p>"Maybe…I  should try to treat Ranma a little better, just like his concubines do.  Yea…that would show them.  Maybe they would finally leave us alone, or  better yet, find something else to do, rather than try to seduce Ranma.  After all, we are engaged and Ranma doesn't  seem to have a problem with <i>that</i> idea.   The whole marriage part seems to be bothering him.  I'll try treating this as an official  relationship."</p><p>Akane  smiled to herself, having actually come up with a plan of her own to keep Ranma  hers.  Then suddenly something hit her,  waking her up fully.  Her smile quickly  turned into a look of concern.</p><p>"Wait  a second!  Does this mean that I  actually want to <i>marry</i> Ranma?   Does that mean I actually <i>love</i> him?"</p><p>Akane  turned her head away from the lights and pulled her blankets up to her neck,  looking into the darkness on the other side of the room, that one word still  ringing in her head.  Did she really  love Ranma?  There were certainly a lot  of "awkward" moments between the two.   Suddenly, Akane thought of another idea, one more like Akane.</p><p>"Or  maybe this is just revenge for all those times I caught those women with  Ranma.  Yea…that's it. It would really  make them angry if they saw Ranma and I getting along.  That would serve them right too!"</p><p>Akane  realized that she was gripping the edge of her blanket so hard her hand started  to hurt.  She relaxed, having convinced  her self yet again that she wasn't acting out of love but for revenge.  Revenge sounded a <i>lot</i> better than  love, and besides, it was more believable.   Who could love a stupid pervert like Ranma any way?  On second thought that number was up to  three.  Thinking of this, Akane rolled  over to P-Chan and placed an arm around him, forgetting the revelation she had.</p><p>Morning  came a bit too soon for Ranma. He struggled to wake up.  Genma was already up and wandering  about.  Ranma sat up in his bed,  smelling the sweet smell of breakfast.   That was enough to wake him up most of the way.  He got up and dressed for the day.  Just as he was about to leave his room, he  bumped into Akane, carrying P-Chan.</p><p>"Oh  sorry Ranma," Akane said in a cheerful tone "Kasumi has breakfast ready, I just  wanted to let you know before it got cold" she said with a big smile.</p><p>Ranma  looked at her, confused.  "Well,  uh…thanks Akane."  He finally managed.</p><p>"Hurry  up now Ranma or we will be late to school again."  Akane said, turning away and heading down stairs.</p><p>"I  wonder what's up with Akane." Ranma said to himself.  "I've never known her to be so cheerful in the morning, except  when…"</p><p>Ranma  suddenly had a terrible thought, one that made him fear for his life.</p><p>"Oh  no…did she help Kasumi…<i>cook</i> breakfast?"</p><p>Ranma's  stomach got weaker as he neared everyone else at the small table, huddled  around what <i>smelled</i> like a normal meal.   Ranma carefully looked around at everyone.</p><p>"Well it looks like everyone is ok."  Ranma thought to himself.  "No one has passed out yet and they all look  like they've had at least two mouthfuls.   Akane couldn't have made a meal that would last for two servings."</p><p>"Hey  Ranma, what are you doing standing there with that look on your face?"  Akane asked, again in an unusually cheerful  tone.  "Do you think <i>I</i> cooked  breakfast today?"</p><p>"N…No, of course not Akane,'' Ranma said with a  nervous chuckle.  "I was just thinkin'  about…school today. I didn't sleep that well last night."  He said as he knelt down at the table,  thanking whatever God had stopped her from cooking.</p><p>"Well,  you know what happens when you get caught sleeping in class, you'll have to  stand in the hall way with all those buckets of water."</p><p>"Yea  I know.  I don't mind the buckets; it's  the water inside them that frightens me.   You never know when Kuno will show up with his "Pig-tailed girl" crap  again."</p><p>Everyone  chuckled at that last statement, as Ranma finally began eating breakfast, a  meal he hadn't had in a few days.</p><p>"So  Akane," Soun started  "I've noticed  today that you seem to be acting nicer to Ranma then in previous days.  Is something going on?"  Soun asked, half way looking across to  Genma, who obviously approved of the "new" Akane.</p><p>"No  dad, nothing is going on today.  It's  such a nice day out there today that I would hate to waste it." Akane said,  looking outside in the sunshine. Soun and Genma eyed her suspiciously.</p><p>"Maybe,  she's been bitten by the jealousy bug."   Nabiki said, not seeming to believe Akane for a minute.</p><p>"Well  I think it's nice that Akane is trying so hard to be kind today."  Kasumi said before Akane had a chance to  speak.  "It's almost like a new Akane woke  up today and decided to replace the old one.   Isn't that lovely?"  Akane nodded  towards her with a smile.</p><p>"Yea,  I'll second that one Kasumi."  Ranma  said.  "That old Akane could be so  un-cute sometimes, especially when she would hit me for no reason.  It's hard to believe that they were the same  person:  And the way that she would  always argue with me, now <i>that</i> was un-cute. "</p><p>Akane's  smile wore off and her temper started to rise.</p><p>"He  wants un-cute? I'll give him un-cute!"   Akane thought to herself, with Ranma still going on about how she "used"  to be.</p><p>"…And  hittin' me over Shampoo and the others was definitely un-cute."  Ranma continued, oblivious to the  ever-seething Akane.  Soun, and Genma  started to look worried.</p><p>Akane  clenched her fists.  "Won't that idiot  shut up already?"  She continued to  herself.  "Here I am trying to be nice  but he keeps leading me on, almost like he <i>wants</i> another kick to the  face.  No, I have to keep calm.  I have to show all those fiancées that I can  be nice too!  In fact I can be nicer  than they can!"</p><p>Akane  forced a smile, as she had done numerous times before.  "Ok Ranma, we're gonna be late for school if  we don't leave now."  She said, grabbing  Ranma's hand and yanking him outside.   "Goodbye everyone!"</p><p>Soun  looked at Genma.  "What do you think is  up with those two Saotome?"  He asked,  puzzled</p><p>Genma  thought for a moment.  "Well I don't  know Tendou.  Ranma was his brash self  as usual, but something must have gotten into Akane."</p><p>"Yes,  after hearing what Ranma said about her, she should have killed him by now."</p><p>"I  already told you, daddy," Nabiki said, getting her school bag together. "Akane  has become jealous over all the other fiancées Ranma has.  You can't really blame her though."</p><p>"I  just think it's wonderful that Akane respects your wishes, Father.  Maybe those two will start to get along  better after today."  Kasumi said with a  big smile, as Nabiki closed the door behind her.</p><p>"You  may be right, Kasumi'' Soun agreed. "But Ranma will have to learn to control  his tongue as well.  After all, Akane  could revert back to the way she was if Ranma kept up his insults."</p><p>Genma  nodded as Kasumi started to clean up the table.  "We will just have to wait and see, Tendou."</p>At school<p>Akane started down the street with Ranma still in  tow.</p><p>"Hey  Akane!" Ranma said  "You can let go of  me now. I think I can find the way to school without your help."</p><p>"Oh,  sorry Ranma, I didn't realize I was still pulling you." Akane said as she let  go of Ranma's hand.  "It's just that our  fathers were beginning to act kind of suspicious of me all of a sudden."</p><p>"Well  I'm not surprised." Ranma said, walking along his usual fence, looking into the  sky with his arms behind his head.   "When a tomboy like you suddenly starts acting like a lady, it kinda  just weirds everyone out. I'm surprised that they didn't take your temperature  or somethin'.  You even had <i>me</i>  wondering what happened to the real Akane."</p><p>Ranma  suddenly noticed that Akane had stopped walking along side him, and stood in  the street fuming and gripping her book sac.   Ranma instinctively responded to the sight by trying to dodge a  projectile that had never missed to date.   After a few seconds he noticed that he was not in severe pain, but still  standing where he was last.  Akane  walked past him, with a smile.</p><p>"Yea  I guess you're right Ranma.  I mean…I  guess I could be considered kinda hasty when it came to my temper.  But I'm trying to change that now for the  better.  Come on you slow-poke! I'll  race you to school!"</p><p>With  those lines, Akane took off towards Furinkan High, leaving Ranma with his mouth  ajar, trying to figure out what just happened.</p><p>"Wait  a second…Akane didn't even touch me." Ranma thought to himself.  "Man, she must really be trying hard.  That sure was a close call.  I hope she keeps up like this.  She's a lot cuter this way."</p><p>Ranma  suddenly realized that he was being left behind.  "Yo, Akane!" He yelled, "You're kiddin' yourself if you think you  can beat me in a race!"  With that,  Ranma took off after her.</p><p>After  a few minutes of running, Ranma and Akane arrived at Furinkan High, where they  met almost the entire male student body.</p><p>"Oh  great, not this again." Akane thought to herself.  "I wonder when Kuno will show up."</p><p>No  sooner than she had thought that, Kuno showed up with Nabiki walking behind  him.</p><p>"It's  about time you two made it here."   Nabiki said with a sly smile.</p><p>Ranma  and Akane looked at her, confused.</p><p>"But  how did you get here before us Nabiki?" Akane said after a moment.  "We left the house before you didn't we?"</p><p>"Well  you should know by now sis that money talks, but this girl doesn't walk.  Isn't that right Kuno-baby?"</p><p>Kuno  did not take his eyes off Ranma, whom was unaware that Kuno was staring at  him.</p><p>"Well  Kuno-baby, I'll have your "delivery" tomorrow.   Same time same place?"</p><p>Kuno  just stood there.</p><p>"Ok  then, <i>Ciao</i>" Nabiki said as she walked inside the school.</p><p>"I  wonder what that "delivery" Nabiki was talking about was."  Ranma thought to himself, still unaware that  Kuno was eyeing him.  "I'll bet she took  more pictures of me and sold them to Kuno so he could pick her up and bring her  to school."</p><p>Kuno  interrupted suddenly.  "Ranma Saotome!"  he shouted.  "We have all heard of your  failure to wed Akane.  That is why I,  Tatewaki Kuno, the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High, hereby dissolve your  relationship with Akane."</p><p>"Yea,  whatever Kuno."  Ranma said, not  impressed in the slightest.</p><p>"But  wait a minute everyone!"  Akane burst  in.  "Ranma and I are still engaged, so  you can't dissolve our relationship."   Ranma looked at her, surprised.    Akane returned a "trust me "look.</p><p>"Nevertheless  my beloved Akane Tendou," Kuno continued "Ranma has cut you severely, raking  wounds across your heart that will never heal.   He must answer to his hideous crimes.   Ranma, you curr, will you step forward and accept my challenge in front  of all these men, knowing that any one of them could be in your place."</p><p>Ranma smiled at Kuno.  "Yea Kuno, I accept your challenge.  Too bad you have to lose in front of such a  large crowd."</p><p>"Enough of your stalling Ranma  Saotome!"  Kuno yelled.  "Feel the Vengeance of Tatewaki Kuno!"</p><p>With those words, Kuno dashed to  Ranma's position in the courtyard, sword drawn and yelling something about  divine retribution.  Ranma dodged his  first swing.  Kuno swung a second time,  Ranma side stepped his attack and planted a knee in his chest.  Kuno gasped as the air got pushed from his  lungs.  Ranma followed up with a swift  elbow to the back of the head, effectively putting Kuno face down in the  pavement.  Ranma stood over him, looking  kind of disappointed.</p><p>"When will that Kuno learn that he  can't beat me no matter how much of his "feel the wrath" junk he spits  out?"  Ranma said, not seeming to be  affected by the sight of Kuno in the pavement.</p><p>Akane stared at the seemingly  lifeless Kuno.</p><p>"Wow Ranma."  Akane said, staring down at him, knocked  out.  "You really let him have it that  time didn't you?"</p><p>"Yea I did Akane.  I figured it was time to settle some past  scores I had with some people.  Besides,  Kuno has <i>no</i> chance with you.   Better for him to learn now while I'm still in a good mood." Ranma  suddenly noticed that the male populous was still staring at the "broken up"  couple.</p><p>"You heard Akane, We're still engaged; just a  minor setback is all.  Sorry guys,  better luck next time, huh?"</p><p>With that having been said, Ranma  cut a path for him and Akane to the school, still wondering if Akane was  serious about what she said earlier.</p><p>"Hey Ranma, thanks for the help back  there."  Akane said with a smile.  "It's not like I'm afraid of fighting all  those guys, it's just what I didn't want to be late for class again."</p><p>"No problem Akane," Ranma said,  returning a smile.  "<i>I</i> should be  the one thanking you." Ranma paused for a second.  "Hey Akane?  Are you…still  in favor of our engagement?" Ranma finally asked. "Because I…uh…"</p><p>Akane looked up into his eyes,  puzzled.  Why would he ask such a  question?  Didn't he already accept what  our fathers were doing?</p><p>"Well,  I think that…um…"</p><p>Akane's answer was cut short by the  ringing of the school bell.</p><p>"Uh oh Ranma, we better hurry,  because of that little stunt Kuno pulled we're late <i>again</i>."  Akane said, with almost an air of relief on  her voice.</p><p>The two darted off for class, with maybe  a few more questions than answers.</p><p>Akane sat in class, trying to pay  attention to the math teacher.  However,  her wandering mind successfully prevented that.</p><p>"I wonder what Ranma is up to."  Akane thought to herself, staring outside to  the courtyard.  "What did he mean "old  scores to settle?  Does that mean that  he is going to finally put an end to all this "fiancée" stuff?  Or maybe he's trying to protect me from all  those other suitors out there…" Akane switched her gaze to her desk.  "I never saw this engagement thing as  something I could choose.  I always  thought of it as something we had to do.   Maybe Ranma is just exercising his right to choose.  I wonder what he will do."</p><p>Akane looked over to Ranma, sound  asleep on the other side of the classroom.</p><p>"Or maybe he's just sick and tired  of all those people bothering him. I never stopped to think what Ranma was  going through, what with three people wanting to marry him and three people  trying to kill him.  Come to think of  it, I've never seen him flatten Kuno like that before.  Usually he just kicks him around a bit and  Kuno limps off like a wounded dog.   Ranma might have killed him if he wasn't careful.  I sure hope he knows what he's doing."</p><p>The sound of the lunch bell ended  any further thought as the whole classroom rushed out the door.  Akane walked over to Ranma and shook him  gently.</p><p>"Come on Ranma, it's lunch  time."  Akane said.</p><p>Ranma lifted his head and looked  around.  He made it to lunchtime without  being sent outside.  "Yea, ok Akane." Ranma  said drowsily, and the two walked to the lunchroom.</p><p>The lunchroom was filled with its  usual loudness.  Accompanying that  loudness were muffled "did you see what happened to Kuno" lines, and "man,  Ranma must have been pissed."</p><p>Ranma sat down in his usual spot and  Akane sat next to him, followed by Akane's friends, who were equally amazed at  Ranma.</p><p>Ranma sat quietly while Akane talked  and joked with her friends, still a bit sleepy from his earlier nap.  He sat there, looking at her, smiling with  her friends.</p><p>"She definitely has a cute  smile."  Ranma thought to himself.  "Maybe this "good Akane" thing is for the  better.  I'll bet it gets tiring always  staying angry and always hitting a person.   I hope she stays like this, it will make confronting everyone that much  easier when they see that we can actually <i>attempt</i> to get along."</p><p>"Hey Ranma."   Akane said, turning to him.   "What are you staring at so?"   Ranma blinked, not realizing what he was doing.</p><p>"Oh…I…was…just  thinking about Kuno is all."  Ranma recovered.  "Yea that Kuno is bound to show up some time  and challenge me again.  Maybe I was too  hard on him."</p><p>"Yea,  I'll say Ranma." Akane said.  "You  planted him face first into the pavement back there.  His nose might have been broken."</p><p>"Yea, maybe I treated him a little  rough.  A martial artist should take  into consideration his opponents level of skill and his own."</p><p>The  conversation continued and soon the lunch bell rang a second time, signaling  the students to return to boredom.  The  rest of the day went pretty fast as far as Ranma was concerned.  He just slept all day, as he had usually  done.  Akane took notes for both of  them.  Well, Ranma would end up asking  her for notes any way so she went ahead and made a second copy for him.  The dismissal bell rang and the two headed  back for home, walking side by side.</p><p>Before  they could leave the courtyard.  Kuno  appeared again, his nose a little redder than usual and a few scratches on his  face.</p><p>"Ranma  Saotome!"  Kuno yelled in traditional  fashion.  "I here by challenge you  again!"</p><p>Ranma  rolled his eyes</p><p>"I  already planted you in the ground once, you want to feel the pavement  again?"  Ranma countered.</p><p>"Ranma  Saotome!  I will continue to challenge  you as long as you deprive me of my beloved Akane Tendou."</p><p>Ranma's  mind when back to the Akane in the lunchroom, sitting there smiling  cutely.  "<i>Your</i> Akane  Tendou?"  Ranma said, cracking his  fists.   "Akane Tendou is <i>mine.</i>  If you want her then come get her!"</p><p>By  this time, the whole student body noticed what was happening and formed a  circle around the three people.  Akane,  stunned, looked up to Ranma with a questioning look.  Ranma pushed her behind his back, his eyes focused on Kuno.  Akane had never seen Ranma this focused.</p><p>"Now's  my chance to put an end to all this misery," Ranma thought to himself.  "Get back Akane."  Ranma said, his fists still clenched.  "This is between me and Kuno and I don't want you to get in the  way.  You might get hurt."</p><p>"But  Ranma…" Akane tried.  Ranma cut her off.</p><p>"Go Akane!"   he said, turning around and looking into her eyes.  Ranma seemed very…determined about  something.</p><p>"Ok  Kuno, this is it…" Ranma said, returning his focus on Kuno.  "You have been doing this junk for months  now and I'm just sick and tired of it.   I'll settle this once and for all right here, right now!"</p><p>"Have  it your way you vile curr you."  Kuno  said.</p><p>Kuno  unsheathed his sword and dashed towards Ranma.   Ranma leaped over him, placing a foot on his head and leaping away.  Kuno stumbled a bit before falling face first  on the pavement, dropping his sword.</p><p>"Is  that all ya got Kuno?"  Ranma asked,  mocking the fallen body.</p><p>"I  have not yet begun to fight, Ranma Saotome."   Kuno said, retrieving his sword.   "Prepare to die!"  He shouted as  he tried to skewer Ranma.  It was at  this point that Ranma realized that this was the same sword Kuno used back on  the "wedding day."  Ranma sidestepped  the blow, but not before it left a small bloody gash on his side.  Kuno, looking satisfied, lifted his sword  and swung at Ranma's head.  Ranma easily  ducked the common attack and planted a fist in his stomach that nearly lifted  Kuno off his feet.  A muffled <i>crack</i>  could be heard coming from Kuno.  He  gasped as his sword fell from his hands.   Ranma followed his fist with a palm strike to Kuno's jaw.</p><p>"Had  enough Kuno?"  Ranma said looking down  at him.</p><p>Kuno  lay sprawled out on his back, fumbling around for his sword.  After a few moments, Kuno managed to clamber  to his feet, holding his sword half-heartedly.</p><p>"It  is the love of <i>my</i> Akane Tendou that keeps me fighting.  I shall smite thee, Ranma Saotome."</p><p>"Geeze…this  guy…just won't give up," Ranma said to himself</p><p>Ranma  now took the offensive, charging Kuno and kicking him in the chest.  A second <i>crack</i> emanated from  Kuno.  Ranma, oblivious to Kuno's  condition, followed his kick to the chest with a swift roundhouse to the side  of his head.  Kuno swaggered and dropped  his sword, but did not fall.  Ranma  moved in for the final blow.  He walked  up to the wounded Kuno and grabbed him by the shirt.  Ranma yanked his face right next to his, noticing for the first  time what a number he had did on him.</p><p>"For  the last time Kuno."  Ranma said.  "Akane is <i>my</i> fiancée.  She loves me and not you.  Got that Kuno?"</p><p>All  eyes immediately turned to Akane, who stared in disbelief.</p><p>"I  will…never give up…Akane Tendou."  Kuno  said, his voice now showing signs of his pain.</p><p>Ranma  rolled his eyes.  Nothing was going to  change Kuno's mind about Akane.  Ranma  had tried everything, including beating him to within an inch of his life.  He was just too stubborn.  Ranma, frustrated, just dropped Kuno.  He would settle things with him later, once  he figured out how.  Ranma whirled to  Akane.</p><p>"Come  one Akane!" Ranma said grabbing her arm rather hard.  "Lets get outta here.   I've had enough of that Kuno today."   Ranma practically dragged the now stunned Akane out of the courtyard and  towards the Dojo, his eyes still on fire.   Some of the students went to Kuno's aid while others, their blood lust  satisfied, continued home.</p><p>"Ranma!"  Akane pleaded, "Let go of my hand, you're starting to hurt me."  Ranma looked at Akane, struggling with his  heavy grip.  He came to his senses and  let go.</p><p>"Sorry  Akane, I just got a little wound up back there."  Ranma suddenly noticed that Akane was not walking beside  him.  He turned around to find Akane,  staring sadly at the ground.</p><p>"What's  wrong Akane?  Did I hurt your hand that  much?"</p><p>"Ranma  you…<i>idiot</i>!  What were you  thinking back there?"  Akane yelled, on  the verge of tears.  "You didn't have to  massacre Kuno like that!  He was just  acting like his old stupid self.  What  you did was uncalled for!"</p><p>Ranma,  now stunned by Akane's words looked in her eyes, now filling with tears.</p><p>"I'm…sorry  Akane." Ranma said, trying to comfort her.   "I had just had about all I could stand of Kuno's  "My love Akane" crap."</p><p>"That's  <i>not</i> the point Ranma!" Akane yelled, looking up at him.  "You could have killed him, and then where  would your reputation as a martial artist have been?"  Ranma was at a loss for words.   "And besides, I belong to no one, especially stupid perverts with  over-sized egos!"  Akane yelled one last  time.  She then ran off, her hands  covering her eyes.</p><p>"Hey, wait Akane!" Ranma called, but to no  avail.  Ranma turned around and punched  a wall in anger, cracking the wall a bit.</p><p>"That  stupid tomboy!  Who does she think she  is anyway?"  he thought to himself,  picking up Akane's book sac.  "It's not  like I meant to destroy Kuno.  I just  wanted to teach him a lesson. Besides, I was nowhere close to killing him…maybe  I should have though… Geeze, Akane can be <i>so</i> un-cute sometimes, and here  I was thinking she had changed.  I  should have known better than that!"</p><p>Ranma  looked back to the school.  An ambulance  was now there, for Kuno no doubt.</p><p>"Maybe  I did go a little overboard on that last one."   Ranma thought to himself as he walked towards the Dojo with a sigh.</p>Confrontation<p>Soun  and Genma sat quietly, playing <i>GO</i> and hoping that Ranma and Akane would  return just as they had left: in good spirits.   Kasumi was just then starting dinner.</p><p>Suddenly,  Akane burst through the door in tears.   She ran up stairs, her feet pounding on the wooden steps.  A door slammed shut, shaking the entire  Dojo.</p><p>"Oh  my!"  Kasumi said, emerging from the  kitchen.  "What happened to Akane this  time?"</p><p>Soun  and Genma looked at each other.  They  then turned to Kasumi.  "How did you  know that was Akane,?"  Soun asked.</p><p>"Well,  I just assumed that was Akane, since slamming doors are pretty common around  here."  Kasumi returned with a smile.  "Oh dear!"   She exclaimed.  "I hope all those  vibrations didn't ruin the cake I was baking."</p><p>"Why  were you baking a cake?"  Soun asked,  returning to his game.</p><p>"Well  father, since today was such a nice day for Akane and Ranma, I decided to  commemorate it with a nice cake.  It's a  recipe I just found and I wanted to see if they would like it."</p><p>"That  is very thoughtful of you Kasumi, but something tells me we may not need a cake  today."</p><p>"Ok  father, I'll just save it for later then.   Oh, the pork buns are almost done."   Kasumi said, going back into the kitchen.</p><p>"Hmm…things  don't look to good for us Tendou."   Genma said, concentrating on the board.</p><p>"I  believe you are right Saotome, Ranma must have said some awful things to get  Akane that upset."</p><p>The  door opened again, revealing an angered Ranma, carrying both book sacs.</p><p>"Akane  is upstairs, Ranma, " Genma said, concentrating on his next move.</p><p>"Feh"  Ranma said, throwing down Akane's book sac.   "Why would I wanna see that tomboy now?   All she ever does is annoy me."</p><p>"It  is your <i>duty</i> as her fiancée to try and comfort her, especially when it's  <i>your</i> fault, Ranma!" Genma returned</p><p>Ranma,  looking angrily at his father, grabbed Akane's book sac and started to ascend  the stairs, slowly contemplating what he would say.  Soun and Genma looked at each other again, shaking their heads and  return to their game.</p><p>Upstairs,  Ranma headed for Akane's room.  The  sound of a door opening came from down stairs.   That must be Nabiki.  She would  surely tell everyone what had happened.</p><p>Ranma  approached Akane's door and knocked lightly.</p><p>No  answer.</p><p>Ranma  knocked a little harder the second time.   "Hey, Akane." He said, "Are you in there?"</p><p>''Go  away Ranma!"  Akane shouted.</p><p>"Can  I come in?"</p><p>"<i>No</i>!"</p><p>"I  brought your book sac, Akane.  You dropped  it back there when you ran off suddenly."</p><p>A  few moments passed.  The door opened  slowly, only enough to let Akane's hand out.   Ranma rolled his eyes and handed the book sac to her.  The door promptly slammed shut.  Ranma was taken aback.</p><p>"Look  Akane…maybe that was the wrong way to go about it back then…but Kuno just won't  listen to anyone."</p><p>No  answer.</p><p>"Akane, stop being so un-cute and come out, dinner  will be ready in a few hours and besides, I forgot to take notes today, so  could you…"</p><p>A  few pieces of paper slid underneath the door.   Ranma gazed at them angrily.</p><p>"<i>Fine</i>,  you want it that way?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"Fine,  be that way you un-cute, sexless, flat-chested, tomboy!"  Ranma yelled through the door.</p><p>"Oh  yea?"  Akane yelled back.  "Well…well…<i>have a nice day</i>!"  Akane said with enough sarcasm to stop a  clock.</p><p>Ranma  snatched up the papers and stormed down stairs.  Akane poked her head out the door to make sure that Ranma had  left.</p><p>"<i>That  stupid jerk</i>!"  Akane said to  herself.  "Sometimes he makes me so mad  I could just kill him!"  Akane fell down  on her bed, tears stinging her eyes once again.  Such harsh words from Ranma had left a scar worse than the  sharpest sword.  Akane sat on her bed,  face planted in her hands, sobbing quietly.   P-Chan emerged from under her bed and jumped up next to her, offering  his condolences.</p><p>"I was only worried about Ranma, P-Chan" Akane said  sadly.  "What would have happened if he  had killed Kuno?  Our fathers would have  had to find another heir to the Dojo.   That Ranma only thinks of himself.   Who the hell would get engaged to an idiot like him?"  Akane suddenly realized that she was one of  those people, which made her a bit sadder.   P-Chan jumped into Akane's lap and looked up with a "don't cry, it will  be ok" look.  Akane picked him up and  gave him a gentle hug.</p><p>Back  down stairs, Nabiki had told everyone what had happened at school.</p><p>Soun  looked at Ranma with tears in his eyes.</p><p>"Oh  son! This is…<i>excellent</i>!"  He  said, hugging Ranma.  "This means that  you really <i>do</i> care about Akane and your engagement!"</p><p>"W…wait  a minute, I never said…" Ranma tried.</p><p>"This  is indeed a good day, huh Tendou?"   Genma said, smiling at him.  "Hey  Kasumi, you can finish that cake you started.   This is indeed a cause for celebration."</p><p>"Oh  good!"  Kasumi said, peeking out from  the kitchen.  "I'm so glad!  I hope everyone likes it."</p><p>"Hey,  pops wait just a minute.  I only did  what I did because I was tired of Kuno always actin' so stupid."</p><p>"Yes,  Tendou, things are definitely starting to look up now!"  Genma said, ignoring Ranma's take on the  whole event.</p><p>"I'll  agree to that Saotome.  We will indeed  have an heir to the Dojo soon, and then we can finally relax."</p><p>Ranma  gave up on trying to explain and parked himself in front of the TV, waiting for  dinner.  Soun and Genma continued to  praise his actions while Nabiki sat, counting the money she had won while  placing bets to see if Kuno was dead or alive.</p><p>A  few hours had passed without a sign of Akane.   Kasumi served dinner in her usual, cheerful way.  Everyone was eating and talking about  wedding plans and whatnot.  Ranma just  sat there.  It was four against one.</p><p>"Yea  daddy," Nabiki continued.  "Ranma sent  poor Kuno to the hospital."  Soun and  Genma looked over to Ranma and smiled</p><p>"The  doctors said that he had two broken ribs, a broken nose, and a sever case of  "Fallen Ego""</p><p>"Oh  my!" Kasumi exclaimed.  "I hope this  Kuno will be alright.  Sometimes Ranma  doesn't think his actions through to the end.   Maybe we should invite him over for some cake?  Just to show him that there are no hard feelings of course.  Maybe Kuno and Ranma could become friends."</p><p>"Not  thinking things through huh?"  Ranma  thought to himself.  "That was my  problem, I actually <i>did</i> think all this through.  Kuno won't listen to words.  Maybe with all those broken bones, that  message will finally find a way through his thick skull.  Yea, me and Kuno friends, that's gonna  happen."  A thought suddenly hit Ranma,  turning his look of indifference to a look of worried ness.  " Even if he did get the message about me  and Akane, he would still fall back on his "Pig-tailed girl."  Maybe "she" should pay him a visit sometime  in the near future.''</p><p>"Hey  boy.  What's with that look on your  face?"  Genma noted.</p><p>"Oh…I  was…"</p><p>"He  must be worried about Akane."  Soun  said, cutting him off.</p><p>"Yes  boy, go up there and take this with you."   Genma said, handing Ranma a plate full of food.</p><p>"Oh  father!"  Kasumi exclaimed.  "Don't forget the cake I made for those  two."</p><p>"Of  course not my dear Kasumi.  It would be only  proper that the fiancées have the first few pieces."</p><p>"Ok  Ranma, here you go."  Kasumi said,  handing him a plate containing two pieces of cake.  The cake looked extremely good; the white frosting covered in  rainbow sprinkles, each slice having its own candle.</p><p>"I  wonder what's goin' on with Akane?"   Ranma thought to himself as he went upstairs.  "Usually Akane at least comes down and eats with us.  Of course she would never look at me the  whole time she was down there.  Maybe I  should at least say I was sorry, after all she went through all that trouble  earlier with her "niceness" stuff."   Ranma approached Akane's room.   Nabiki stopped him as he neared Akane's door.</p><p>"Hey  Ranma?  What do you plan on doing with  that cake?"  She asked.</p><p>"Oh,  pops and Mr. Tendou wanted me to take dinner up to Akane.  You know she never came down to get it  herself."</p><p>"Well  Ranma…" Nabiki said, folding her arms with a slight smile.  "You know daddy and Mr. Saotome will come to  spy on you two right?"</p><p>Ranma  looked at her.  She did have a  point.  "How much is it gonna cost,  Nabiki?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh…well  I don't know.  I normally charge by the  hour for this kind of thing, but today I'll give you a special one-time flat  rate of 300 yen."</p><p>Ranma  looked defeated.  If it was gonna cost 300  yen than so be it.  It was a small price  to pay for peace of mind.</p><p>"Ok  Nabiki, you got a deal."</p><p>"Wise choice.   I'll expect payment tomorrow; you seem to have your hands full…in more  ways than one."  Nabiki walked down  stairs, saying something about renting Soun's favorite movie.</p><p>"Good,  now its just me and Akane." Ranma though to himself, tapping his foot against  her door.</p><p>"<i>Go  away Ranma</i>!"  Akane yelled.</p><p>"Oh  come on Akane, stop being so un-cute."   Ranma said, rolling his eyes.</p><p>"Don't  forget, Ranma, I'm also a sexless, flat chested, tomboy!"</p><p>Ranma  was knocked back by those words.  "I had  no idea she would've taken it so hard."   He thought to himself.</p><p>"Well,  Akane, I'm…sorry." Ranma managed.  "I  didn't mean it when I called you a sex-less, flat-chested, tomboy.  I was just a little excited, what with me  having destroyed Kuno like that.   Besides, I don't think you're flat chested.  In fact I think they are…"</p><p>Ranma  promptly shut himself up to keep him from getting into even more trouble.  Akane's door slowly opened.  Ranma cringed as a furious Akane emerged,  fists clenched.  Akane just stood there,  seeming to let Ranma inside.  Ranma  slowly crept forward with a nervous smile.   He could hear Akane's stomach asking for food but didn't acknowledge to  Akane that he knew.</p><p>"Here,  Akane."  Ranma said, handing Akane a  plate of food and setting the cake down on her desk.  Akane took the plate without much hesitation and began eating.</p><p>Ranma  looked about, nervously.  The silence  was killing him. Akane was not even acknowledging his existence at the present  moment.  Ranma caught sight of  P-Chan.  The two eyed each other for a  few moments.  "P-Chan" would surely have  something to say about all this.</p><p>"Look,  Akane" Ranma finally said.  "What was  your problem back there?  All I was  trying to do was teach Kuno a lesson.   You know he wouldn't have listened to reason."</p><p>"My  <i>problem</i> back there was you never think about anyone but yourself."  Akane said calmly, not taking her eyes off  her plate.</p><p>"But  I <i>was</i> thinking about you when I did that Akane!  I thought you wanted me to get rid off all  my suitors.  I didn't think it mattered  whether it was my male or female suitors."</p><p>"No,  Ranma, your weren't thinking of me, your were thinking of only yourself.  What made me even madder was the fact that  you didn't seem to care about the Dojo."   Akane was now even calmer than before.</p><p>Ranma, noticing Akane's calmness and the storm that  would follow, started to sweat.  "W…What  are you talking about Akane?"  He asked,  dreading the words that would follow.</p><p>"What  I'm talking about, <i>Ranma</i> is what would have happened if you had killed  Kuno?"</p><p>Ranma  just sat there.  "Well for one thing, he  would have stopped bothering me."  He  though to himself, knowing fully that if Akane could read minds he would be  dead.</p><p>"See  Ranma, you had no idea what you were doing."</p><p>"Well  are you gonna tell me or do I have to go and ask Kuno what I was doing.  I'll bet he could tell me <i>exactly</i>  what I did."  Ranma suddenly realized that  he had spoken his thoughts, yet again, but he did not show any signs of  weakness.</p><p>"Ranma  you <i>idiot</i>!"  Akane said, whirling  on him.  "If you had killed Kuno, your  reputation as a martial artist would have been shot!  Our parents would have had to find a new heir to the dojo!"  Akane quickly turned her head away from  Ranma, trying to hide her tears.  Ranma  was knocked speechless.  Did Akane  really worry that much about their engagement?</p><p>Ranma  went over to Akane and sat next to her on the bed.  "So…does this mean that you <i>want</i> to get married?"</p><p>Akane  sniffled a bit, stalling.</p><p>"N…no,  that's not it."  She said, turning to  Ranma.  "It's just that, who knows who  dad would have picked to replace you."</p><p>"So,  you <i>don't</i> wanna go through with this marriage thing with me, is that  it?"</p><p>"No…I didn't say that.  It's just that I…" Akane looked up into Ranma's eyes.  "I've, gotten pretty…used to you by  now.  Another fiancée would just  complicate things all over again for me.</p><p>"So…what  are you talkin' about, Akane?"</p><p>Akane paused for a moment.  What was she saying?  What <i>was</i> she talking about?</p><p>"You  know Ranma, maybe you're right."  Akane  said, offering a smile, wiping away her tears.   "Maybe I was being un-cute back there.   I shouldn't have worried you about it.   I'm really sorry about all this Ranma."</p><p>Ranma  sat quiet for a second.  Why was Akane  apologizing?  Wasn't he the one that  messed up?</p><p>"Now  what is this cake for?"  Akane asked,  changing the subject</p><p>"It  was a new recipe she wanted to try."   Ranma said, a little confused at the whole situation.  "She also said something about commemorating  this day…"</p><p>"Yea,  sometimes Kasumi can be real thoughtful."   Akane said, taking a bite out of the cake.</p><p>"Well, I better go and study tonight. Oh, and Akane,  thanks for the notes."  He said with a  smile.  Akane returned his smile and  finished her dinner as Ranma walked out and closed the door.</p><p>A  sick feeling passed through Akane as the door fell closed.  "What did you almost do to yourself?"  She thought, sickened that she had almost admitted  her true feelings for Ranma.  "You  almost told him that you <i>wanted</i> to marry him."  Akane paused for a minute, realizing that Ranma was right earlier  today.  She <i>did</i> love him.  That grim reality made her stomach  weak.  She set the half eaten cake down,  noticing that her hands were shaky and starting to sweat.</p><p>"I  need to lie down." Akane said to herself, getting ready for bed.</p><p>*****Ok,  how about that for starters? Hope you liked it. Guess the little description  thing gives away the ending, but hey. You'll never guess how they get there  Never! Not in a million years!</p><p>However  in all truthfulness, this is my least favorite chapter. But I couldn't think of  anything else. So I just wrote something down, rather than let writer's block  strangle me with its cold, bare hands. Writer's block is deadly, isn't it?  Well, don't agree with something here (as was pointed out the first time I  posted) then blame it on writer's block. And I promise, it's all up hill from  here. Actually, the middle chapters are my favorite, but everyone liked the  ending too it seemed. So…as always, tell me what you think (Man…that's really  asking for it…) I'm not sure how often I'll update this, as a year can make a  big difference in a person's life. But I'll try to keep them coming regularly.  If this works well, I might post the other two fics I wrote that only two other  people know about. So…until next we meet! :D:D:D*****</p>
