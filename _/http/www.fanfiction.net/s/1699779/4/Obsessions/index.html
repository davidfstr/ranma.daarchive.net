</div><p>Chapter four</p><p><u>Akane's  Decision</u></p><p>Akane sat in her bed, still stunned on the events  that just took place.  "What in the  world just happened?  Did Shampoo cure  me?  No it must have been Cologne.  Ranma must have agreed to marry Shampoo if  she woke me up.  That idiot." Akane  paused for a second.  "What am I  saying?  That's just what they want to  happen to me:  for me to get mad and not  figure out something.  Well that's <i>not</i>  going to happen.  If any one marries  Ranma it's going to be me!"</p><p>Akane looked down at her chest.  There was a large gauze pad a little off  center of her chest.  Akane suddenly  felt the pain from the wound.  She had a  bit of trouble breathing also.  She  peeled back the tape and examined her wound.   It was deep.  At least the  bleeding had almost stopped.  "Well, I  can't do anything from this stupid hospital bed.  I have to tell everyone what's going on.  Maybe we can figure out something."</p><p>Akane jumped out of her bed and threw off her  hospital gown.  She looked in a near by  closet.  A dress hung there.  The blue one she would usually wear.  Her favorite.  She quickly slipped it on, her wound protesting about the  movement.  She opened the door and  walked out, leaving everything else behind.   A few nurses noticed that was the same girl given a week to live.</p><p>"Hey, Ms. Tendou.   You can't leave yet.  Your wounds  need to have time to heal" a Nurse called out to her.</p><p>"Did you see a girl, a little taller than me with  blue hair, dragging Ranma out my room?"</p><p>" I did, I assumed it was another of your  sisters and your Grandmother forcing him from your room."</p><p>"Which way did they go?"</p><p>"They went north it looked like."</p><p>"She must be taking Ranma to the café to get ready  for her wedding."  Akane whispered to  herself.  The nurse, having over heard, looked  at her, puzzled.</p><p>"I thought that young man was <i>your</i> Fiancée"</p><p>"He is, but he gave himself up to revive me."</p><p>"Oh, how romantic!"   Another nurse added.</p><p>"Well Ms. Tendou, I can't stop you.  You really should stay here though."</p><p>"I can't stay here, knowing Ranma is with  Shampoo.  Who knows what she will do to  him.  Or rather, <i>force</i> him to  do."  Akane said, walking to the exit.</p><p>"Wait just a second!"  A doctor called to her.   Akane whirled on him, with a look that could break glass.  "I can't let you  without these any  way."  The doctor said, handing her a  small bag.  "You'll need to change the  dressing twice a day.  Make sure to pack  the wound good or you will get an infection."</p><p>Akane withdrew her look and smiled at the  doctor.  "Thank you!"  She said, walking out the front door.</p><p>"Well, doctor Katsuguri?  What should I put on the A.M.A?"</p><p>"Put on there "love.""</p><p><u>Back Home</u></p><p>Akane burst in the Dojo door, almost ready for a  fight.  Soun and Genma looked up at the  noise, their eyes taking in the sight.</p><p>"Akane!  Oh  my goodness, you're  you've come home!"  Soun said, crying tears of joy.</p><p>"What good news this is, huh Tendou?  Where is Ranma, Akane?"  Genma asked, looking around for his son.</p><p>"Oh, dad, I have some explaining to do." Akane said,  walking up to him.</p><p>Kasumi peeked her head out the kitchen just as  Nabiki came down stairs.  "Oh my!"  Kasumi exclaimed.  "Welcome home Akane! You sure do look a lot better than when we  left.  I was starting to worry that you  wouldn't be eating right.  I'm so glad  that they sent you home."</p><p>"Hey Akane, glad you're back. I knew something that  small could never keep you down."   Nabiki offered.</p><p>"Now wait a second, they didn't <i>let</i> me out  the hospital, I ran away!"  Akane  asserted.  Concerned looks abounded.</p><p>"Akane, why did you leave the hospital?  Come to think of it how did they revive you  so fast? Just yesterday you were in a coma." Soun said</p><p>"Ok everyone."   Akane started.  "Here's what  happened.  I was in this great plain,  visiting scenes from my past, when all of a sudden, I was sitting up in bed,  coughing really hard.  Next thing I see,  Ranma was there, being dragged away by Shampoo and Cologne, Shampoo saying  something about <i>their</i> wedding.   So I got up as fast as I could and ran down here so see if anyone heard  the news."</p><p>Soun and Genma looked at each other.</p><p>" is most unfortunate Tendou.  Ranma seems to have gotten himself in a sort  of bind."</p><p>"Yes, Saotome, Ranma and Akane were getting along  too well for Ranma to choose to wed Shampoo over my daughter.  They must have tricked Ranma with some sort  of potion again."</p><p>"No dad, I don't think they used a potion, they used  something even more sinister.  Somehow,  I think that Ranma agreed to marry Shampoo if her great-grandmother saved me  from that coma.  Cologne does know a lot  about medicine."</p><p>Soun and Genma nodded.  Nabiki just stood there, listening.  Kasumi went back to cooking.</p><p>"Well, in any case, Akane.  My first duty as your father is to ensure your well-being.  Are you <i>sure</i> you are well enough to  run around?  The doctor said that attack  just missed your lungs."</p><p>"Yes dad, I'm fine, I already told you that."  Akane assured him, hiding the pain that  resulted from every breath she took.</p><p>"Well our next step is to confront Ranma and Shampoo,  to see what exactly is going on."  Genma  said, thinking a bit.</p><p>"Ok, Mr. Saotome, I'll go down to the café and find  out just what Ranma's problem is!"  With  that, Akane turned around and ran off to the café.  Soun was about to join her when Genma stopped him.</p><p>"Wait Tendou.   Do you see what is happening?"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Akane is in love with Ranma.  That is why she wants him back.  Ranma is in love with Akane.  That's why he supposedly gave his rights up  for her."</p><p>Soun looked at Genma for a few seconds.</p><p>"This is a battle <i>we</i> need to stay out of  Tendou.  Fighting for each other will  only result in a faster marriage for the two.   The sooner they are wed the sooner we can pass the Dojo to them.  This will be a hard thing to do, but it is  for the best that they find out each other's feelings for themselves."</p><p>"I see, Saotome.   I understand what you are saying.   Fate can only bring them closer at this point.   if they cannot win?"</p><p>"There can be no other fate other than those two  marrying each other.  They have already  decided on that.  All we have to do is  watch."</p><p><u>Redemption</u></p><p>"Oh, Shampoo so happy!  Ranma will be Shampoo's husband once and for all!"  Shampoo exclaimed, looking back at Ranma,  who was trailing behind.  "Hurry up  Ranma, is much planning to do."</p><p>Ranma did not answer.  "Enjoy it while you can Shampoo.   Akane will figure out something, then I'm outta here.  I sure hope she understands.I wonder if  there was anything else I could have done." Ranma said to himself.</p><p>"Hey Ranma!   Hurry up.  Sooner we reach café  sooner we get married!"</p><p>"Yea, and the sooner I can divorce you Shampoo."</p><p>Shampoo smiled slyly at Ranma.  "Silly Ranma, no divorce in Amazon  weddings.  Weddings last forever."</p><p>"Or until one of us dies." Ranma returned with a confident  smile.</p><p>"Come now, son-in-law.  That's no way to talk about such a joyous occasion."  Cologne said, hopping along side Shampoo</p><p>"What's joyous about being forced into a marriage I  didn't even want?  Remember, I only did  this to save Akane, not for some damn, out dated Amazon law."</p><p>The three entered the Café, Shampoo going about,  trying on dresses she had pre bought.   Cologne was getting all the rituals set up.  This would be an Amazonian wedding.  Ranma sat in a corner.   Those two were sure moving really fast.</p><p>"Hey, what's the big rush, its not like were gonna  get married tomorrow."  Ranma called out  to the two.</p><p>"Silly Ranma, wedding <i>is</i> tomorrow.  You no hear what great-Grandmother  said?"</p><p>Ranma kicked himself.</p><p>"Geeze, I really should learn how to listen  sometimes.  Well, I still believe in  Akane."   His eyes moved to the "closed"  sign hanging on the door.  Suddenly  Ranma caught a glimpse of blue through the window.  "Hmm, that's Akane's favorite color.  That blue dress she would always wear.  I wonder what."</p><p>Akane burst in the door, interrupting Ranma's little  dialogue.  "Ranma!"  She called, looking at him.</p><p>"Akane! What are you doing here?"  Ranma said, running up to her.  Akane leapt into his arms, not minding the  pain when she found herself on the receiving end of a hug.</p><p>"You idiot! Did you really think I would let you get  away that easily?"  Akane said, stepping  back and looking up into Ranma's eyes.   His eyes were full of joy.</p><p>"Akane, what you do here?"  Shampoo asked, defensively.   "Ranma is Shampoo's husband!"</p><p>"Not while I'm still alive Shampoo."</p><p>Cologne joined in.   "No, it's true, Ranma agreed to marry Shampoo.  It was his own choice."</p><p>Akane was taken aback.  " that true?  But,  back at the room, didn't you say.?"</p><p>"No, it <i>wasn't</i> my choice.  It was either marry Shampoo,   you.  I'm sorry Akane; I really didn't  have a choice.  I tried everything short  of going back into time to try and revive you.   Even Dr. Tofu tried to help.  It  was a pressure point called the Fierce Lion's point.  Of course Cologne is the only one alive with the right tools to  hit the spot correctly."  Ranma said,  eyeing Cologne.</p><p>Akane shot a glare at the two conspirators.</p><p>"Too bad, Akane lose, Shampoo win.  Better luck next time."  Shampoo said with a smile.</p><p>"No, my beloved Shampoo.  You can't marry Ranma.  I  love you!"  Came a voice from the back.</p><p>"You shut up duck boy!  Ranma is Shampoo only true love.   Besides, you lose too much."   Shampoo said, splashing Mousse with a near by glass of water.  Mousse hung his head, having been defeated  yet again.</p><p>Shampoo went over to Ranma, hanging off his arm,  almost like she was rubbing it in Akane's face.  Ranma tried his best to dislodge the Amazon.  Akane looked on, furious.  The old Akane was back now.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at Shampoo.  "I'll see to it that this wedding does <i>not</i>  take place.  Eye for an eye, huh  Shampoo?"</p><p>"Good luck Akane. You need!"  Shampoo shot back</p><p>"Come on Ranma, lets get out of here."  Akane said, grabbing Ranma by the arm.</p><p>"Not so fast, Akane."  Cologne said, almost in a manner of enjoying her own speech.  "According to Amazon traditions, Ranma must  sleep with his fiancée the day before the wedding.  If he doesn't, he would be breaking a very sacred law.  A law with the penalty of death."</p><p>"Somehow I doubt that even <i>you</i> would kill  Ranma."  Akane said</p><p>Ranma looked down at Shampoo, worriedly.  Shampoo looked up to him and smiled.</p><p>"And what if Ranma decides not to go through with  the wedding?"</p><p>"Well, since son-in-law agreed to it, if he broke  his promise he would be killed on the spot."</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes.   Everything was death in this culture. He looked over to Akane,  who was starting to show signs of weakening.   "Hey Akane, you can trust me.   Nothing will happen.  I don't <i>have</i>  to stay here.  Besides, you can't give  up; you're so un-cute when you do.  I'm  sure you will think of something.  Now  go ahead and tell everyone I'm ok. "   Ranma said, in his usual confident tone.  Akane had always fallen for that side of him.</p><p>She looked up in his eyes, a few tears in hers.  "Ok Ranma, I trust you."  She said with a smile.  Ranma had always fallen for that cute smile  of hers.  Akane dried up her tears and  put on her battle face.  "See you  tomorrow, Shampoo."  She said, turning  one last glance at Ranma before disappearing out the door.</p><p>"No worry Ranma, is nothing Akane can do."  Shampoo said, reassuringly.</p><p>Cologne did  not look so confident.  "I did not think  to consider Akane's determination.  She  would probably figure it out."  She  thought to herself, going about with more preparation.  Ranma decided to stay at the café for just a  few hours.  Pops would surely rip his  head off if he went back to the Dojo.</p><p>"I have <i>got</i> to think of something."  Akane started to think to herself, as she  walked back to the Dojo.  "I sure hope  Ranma will be ok in there.  I'll bet  there is something, some sort of law I can use against those two."</p><p>Suddenly, Akane's mind went back to when Ranma had  first defeated Shampoo.  "The  book!"  She said, audibly.  "That book with all the translations in it  that Nabiki had.  That book was sure to  have wedding rituals in it.  Maybe there  <i>is</i> a way around this thing after all."   Akane stared to run to the Dojo, but her wound quickly protested.  She winced, and her breathing became  shallow.  "Better not rush this," she  said to herself.  "A lot of good that  book will do without me to read it."</p><p>She soon arrived at the Dojo, a bit winded but in  fair shape.  She did the best she could,  going up the stairs and knocking on Nabiki's door.</p><p>"Hey, sister, let me in!"  Akane demanded opening the door, revealing Nabiki, lying on her  bed and messing with her abacus.  Akane  looked around, desperately.</p><p>"Hey Akane, what are you looking for?"  Nabiki asked, setting the abacus down.</p><p>"Remember that book that had all those translations  in it, the book that you used to help with what Shampoo was saying?"</p><p>"Yea, I remember that book.  It's on the shelf over there."  Nabiki said, pointing</p><p>Akane thumbed through the books and found it.  "Ah, here it is!"  She exclaimed.  "Thanks  Nabiki!"</p><p>"Hey, wait a minute Akane, this isn't a free  library."</p><p>"<i>What</i>!   This is for Ranma! How can you think about money at a time like this?"</p><p>"Well, I figure that this is an "investment" in your  future."</p><p>"Put it on my tab!" Akane said, running out the room  and into hers.  Nabiki thought to  herself for a moment.</p><p>"What was Akane's tab up to?"  She gathered some notes together.  "Looks like 4300 yen so far.  Maybe I should charge interest.  Nah, after all, she is family.  I wouldn't want to take advantage of  her."  Nabiki went back to her  calculations; Kuno was next for an audit.</p><p>Akane sat on her bed.  Any movement she would take upset her wound even more.  "Maybe I did leave the hospital too  early.  Well I really didn't have a  choice; Shampoo said the wedding was tomorrow.   I'll bet she has been planning that for months.  Well, lets see what is in here."  Akane opened the book and started to read  through it, page by page.  She caught  sight of flash of black.</p><p>"Oh, hello Ryoga."   She said to the flash.  It was  P-Chan, looking up to her.  If pigs  could cry, this would certainly prove they could.  Akane set the book down and looked at P-Chan.</p><p>"You know Ryoga, I should have killed you the instant  I figured out your secret.  Did you have  any idea that you might have hurt me by spying on me?  Well, I forgive you Ryoga but you should leave before Ranma gets  back.  <i>I</i> may have forgiven you  but Ranma would surely be out for blood.    Besides, I have something important to do. Don't worry I'm fine.  That attack didn't hurt that bad."  Akane resumed her reading.</p><p>Ryoga, his mind going in all sorts of directions,  simply backed out the room and ran outside, hoping for once that he would get  lost and never return.  If only he was  so lucky.</p><p>Akane stayed in her room for hours, flipping pages  from one language to the next.  A knock  came from her door.</p><p>"Akane, would you like some dinner?"  Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Sure, Kasumi."   Akane said, looking over to her clock.   It was 7:45.  Kasumi entered with  a plate brimming with food.  She looked  at Akane, sitting all hunched over that strange book.  "You can just set that plate over at my desk, Kasumi.  Thanks for bringing me some food; I lost all  track of time."  She said, smiling  sheepishly at Kasumi.  Kasumi set the  plate down on her desk and took a worried look with Akane.</p><p>"Akane, shouldn't you take a break?  You've been up here for hours, besides I  think that dressing needs to be changed."</p><p>Akane looked down at her wound.  Blood was starting to soak through the pad  and on to her dress.  She suddenly  remembered how bad it hurt.  "Well, ok  Kasumi, I guess I should take a little break.   Mind helping me?  It kinda hurts  a little"</p><p>Kasumi mothered Akane's wound.  Good thing Akane was used to pain, in more  ways than one.</p><p>"Ok, Akane, you're all set now." Kasumi said,  smiling.  Akane returned her smile.</p><p>"Ok, thanks"  and she resumed her reading.</p><p>Kasumi headed for the door.  She turned around, looking worriedly at Akane.  She was totally engrossed in that book.  She then noticed that Akane had forgot about  her dinner.</p><p>"Oh dear." She said to herself.  "I do hope Akane will be alright.  She must really love Ranma to go through all  this."  Kasumi closed the door and left  her to her studies.</p><p>Ranma sat in the back of the café, looking at  everything going on.  "You know, you're  wastin' your time."</p><p>No answer.   The café was slowly turning into a sort of cathedral, complete with  streamers, music, even a cake that was pre decorated with little figures of  Ranma and Shampoo.  Ranma rolled his  eyes at that sight.</p><p>"You like cake, Ranma?"  Shampoo asked.</p><p>" cute" Ranma said, his cool and collected  nature returning.</p><p>"Oh, Shampoo so happy.! Shampoo make good wife for Ranma.  Then we have many children."</p><p>"Yea, right Shampoo <i>as if </i>I would even  consider it."</p><p>Shampoo just smiled and went back to her  great-Grandmother.</p><p>Ranma leaned back in his chair, arms behind his head  and staring at the ceiling.  "Oh  man.  This is really not good.  Shampoo and Cologne were serious about  this.  I wonder what Akane is up  to.  She better think of something.  I don't think I could stand life with  Shampoo.  Well if worse came to worse I  would figure out something else, or just simply run away.  But that wouldn't solve my problems.  Shampoo would just keep chasing me, like she  did when she tried to kill me."  Ranma  looked around for a minute or so.  "I  think I'll take a nap, then I'll head back to the Dojo."  He said, heading upstairs.  He fell onto the bed.  His mind kind of hurt with all the thinking  he had done.  "I better just try to  forget about all this.  Akane will come  through, if all the times she hit me is any indication.  Besides, Akane is too jealous to let anyone  marry me."  Ranma soon found himself  asleep.</p><p>Akane found herself racing to the Café. "I did it, I  <i>can</i> stop this marriage. Ranma and I will be so happy."  She thought to herself, actually starting to  formulate her own wedding.  She exploded  into the Kat café</p><p>"Ranma!" She called.  "Ranma I found something.   Its called the." Akane's happy look turned into one of extreme  sadness.  Her jaw dropped.  "Ranma, what are you doing?"  she asked, looking to the back of the  Cafe.  Ranma and Shampoo were in their  wedding outfits, looking lovingly in to each other's eyes.  Ranma in a sharp tuxedo and Shampoo was  wearing a beautiful wedding dress.</p><p>"Silly Akane, Ranma and Shampoo getting  married.  Did you not hear?"</p><p>".I thought."</p><p>Ranma turned to Akane, smiling.  "Well, at first I didn't want to go through  with this, but the night I had with Shampoo opened my eyes."</p><p>Akane's heart skipped a beat.  "!"   She could barely stand to say those words.  She looked upon the couple, holding hands.  Tears started in her eyes.  "Ranma.I loved you.  Didn't you tell me the same back there?"</p><p>"Yea, but that was before I found out what a cutie  Shampoo was.  No offence Akane, but  Shampoo is much better looking than you.   She can even cook.  Just face it  Akane, we were never meant to be together."</p><p>Akane collapsed into a heap of tears on the ground,  the ceremony reaching the "I Do's" When Ranma said those words, it was like he  had reached into her chest and ripped her heart out.  The couple happily walked by the heap on the ground, saying  something about going to China to have Ranma's curse removed.  Akane's life was over.  She had fought to keep Ranma to herself, but  had failed.  She had nothing to live for  any more.  All the things she did for  Ranma were in  couldn't stand being without him, let alone him being  with Shampoo.  She would end her  suffering now.</p><p>Suddenly, a large <i>Bang</i> came from outside  Akane's window.  Akane jumped out of her  bed, ready for a fight.</p><p>"Wait a second" She said to herself.  "What am I doing back at the Dojo?  Oh, that must have been a  like a  nightmare.  What a horrible nightmare."  Akane noticed that she was soaked in sweat and shaking all over.  Her chest hurt, not from the wound, but from  the dream.  Akane ran out of breath and  had to sit down.  She put her hand over  her wound, trying to calm herself down.   "It's ok, Akane" she said to herself.   "It was just a dream.  Ranma  would never sleep with Shampoo."  Akane  struggled to get her breath.  Her heart  felt like it was about to jump out of her chest.</p><p>After a few minutes, Akane regained most of her  composure.  She looked around her  room.  The moon was looking into  hers.  It was 1:14 am.  "I must have fallen asleep studying that  stupid book."  Akane flipped through the  last few pages.  A feeling of dread  washed over her.</p><p>" book had nothing in it but  translations of Amazonian words."  Akane  began to fear the worst would happen in a few hours.  What was she going to do now?</p><p>She looked out the window, hoping the stars would  give her a hint.  Her eye caught glimpse  of something on the ground.  A small box  lie there.  "What is that?"  She asked.   Akane then remembered that she was awoken by a bang at her window.  She went downstairs and outside.  She picked up the box and examined it carefully.  It was even gift-wrapped, with a little red  bow on top of the shiny, yellow paper.   She felt a small breeze.  Someone  was watching her.  She whirled towards  the stone fence.  A figure stood on  it.</p><p>"Hey! Who are you?"   She called.  The figure leapt  away, silently.  "Hey, come back  here!"  Akane started to pursue the  figure, but her wound reminded her to take it easy.  "I wonder who that was," she said, returning to her room.  She turned on the light and tore away at the  paper.</p><p>A large tome lay before her and a few white things  had fallen out of the paper.</p><p>"Feathers?" she asked.  "What in the world is going on?"</p><p>She opened the book and thumbed through a few  pages.  It was all in Amazonian.</p><p>"Great, some gift, I can't even read it.  Who would leave me such a thing?"  Akane thought for a few minutes.  "Ryoga is probably a hundred miles from  here, and besides, I think he's a little afraid of Ranma now.  Ranma would never give me a gift.  His mind doesn't work that way.  Kuno wouldn't give me a book.  More than likely it would be a bust of  himself for me to hug when I felt alone, <i>As if</i>!"</p><p>Akane examined the book, turning it every which  way.  "Well, its not booby trapped so  Kodachi is out.   this is her  way of apologizing.  Seems kind of weird  of her to give me an Amazonian book though.   It may be from Shampoo, but why would she be giving me a gift?  Mousse had nothing to do with me.  He only hated Ranma."</p><p>Perplexed, she flipped through the pages again.  At least there were pictures in the  book.  Some of the pictures showed  fighting Amazons, others showed various martial arts moves.  Akane stumbled upon a curious picture.  It was of two people, getting married.  She examined the picture.  The woman had hair like Shampoo.  The man was tall like Ranma.  She eyed over the printing on either side of  the picture.  Some of the printing was  underlined.  She looked at the underlined  words.  Curious, she flipped pages.</p><p>The next page was of two women fighting.  The same words appeared again,  underlined.  Akane sat on her bed,  confused.  "What is with those  words?"    She looked carefully at the  picture, examining it closely.  It was  just of two women fighting.  One was  wearing a combat Gi, the same yellow color of Akane's and the other was wearing  a long dress.  Akane's mind  clicked.  "Wait a second!"  She observed the dress.  It looked like a wedding dress.</p><p>Her curiosity peaked, she flipped pages again,  revealing yet another picture.  The same  underlined words were there.  This time,  they were over the picture, almost like a title.  She looked this latest picture.   It was a marriage scene, with the same guy, but the woman wearing the Gi  was now dressed in the wedding dress.   Akane's eyes went wide.</p><p>"This  only I could find out what those words  mean!  It seems like the exact thing  I've been looking for."  Akane thought  for a minute.  "I don't know Amazonian.  The only people that did were Shampoo,  Cologne and Mousse, and I doubt any of them would help me."  Akane suddenly kicked herself.  "That Book! That book I've been reading has  translations for Amazonian."  Akane  quickly scrambled around for the book.   It lay on the floor beside her bed.   She took the two books, sat them in her lap, and proceeded to translate  those words as best she could.</p><p>Ranma was awoken by a soft caress to his face.  He clenched his eyes, realizing that was  still in the Kat Café. He overslept again.   He rolled over, away from the person.   A small kiss found its mark on his cheek.  Ranma's eyes popped open.   It was Shampoo.  Her face was <i>too</i>  close to his.  Ranma sat up  quickly.</p><p>"Hey, Shampoo, couldn't you see I was  sleepin'?"</p><p>Shampoo smiled, seductively.  Ranma instinctively backed up, but found his  bed had lay next to a corner.  Through  the moonlight, Ranma could see Shampoo was not dressed in her usual  clothing.  She was dressed in a short,  light night gown, that hugged her every curve with its light blue fabric.</p><p>".Maybe we should wait to go through with this." Ranma said  nervously.</p><p>"Shampoo wait too long Ranma.  You like what Shampoo wearing?"</p><p>".yea, but it's not like I want to."</p><p>Shampoo pressed her lips against Ranma's.  He pushed back on Shampoo, making her  release his lips.</p><p>"What wrong  no like Shampoo?"  She said, sadly.</p><p>".its lot like that."  Ranma said.  He noticed  his hands were trembling.  " don't  think it's a good idea.I'm kinda tired and besides, you should get some sleep."</p><p>"Maybe Ranma like this" Shampoo said, undoing her  top.  It fell to the ground slowly as  Ranma watched it hit the ground.  Almost  hesitantly, Ranma looked up at Shampoo, his eyes widened.  Shampoo started towards him.</p><p>Ranma backed up as far as he could into the corner,  still sitting on the bed.  ".Just  a Second, ."  Shampoo grabbed  Ranma and hugged him.  Ranma's mind went  back to Akane.</p><p>"I Love you" Said Akane's voice in Ranma's  head.  Ranma summoned up all his  fighting spirit and gave Shampoo a tremendous push back.  Shampoo flew backwards and landed on the floor,  stricken.</p><p>"For the last time Shampoo, I don't love you, I  never did! I love Akane only!"  Ranma  said, rising from his bed.</p><p>" Amazon law before marriage."  Shampoo said, approaching Ranma yet again.</p><p>" Well I doubt you would have the heart to kill me,  even if I did refuse.  We are <i>not</i>  gonna get married, Shampoo.  Akane <i>will</i>  save me from you."</p><p>"Fine, Ranma" Shampoo said, narrowing her eyes. "I  force you to comply."</p><p>"<i>What</i>!   You can't force me to do anything!"</p><p>Shampoo said nothing as she ran to Ranma.  Ranma dodged her attempted tackle.  He ran down stairs, into the kitchen,  Shampoo hot on his trails.  He tried to  front door.  It was barred.  "Great." Ranma said to himself.  Quickly he turned to see Shampoo walking  towards him.  "This calls for drastic  measures."</p><p>Ranma ran by Shampoo and stopped at a near by  sink.  He grabbed a bowl and filled it  full of water.  Shampoo was still  approaching him.  Ranma turned around,  and dumped the water over his head, triumphantly.</p><p>"Try to force me now, Shampoo!  I'm not equipped for the job, if you know  what I mean."</p><p>Shampoo  smiled.  "Silly Ranma, Shampoo knew you  would do that.  Shampoo <i>very</i>  prepared."</p><p>Ranma stared in disbelief.  "Man, Shampoo must have been thinking of this for a long  time."  Ranma shook all the thoughts out  of her head on what she had in store for her.</p><p>Shampoo grabbed Ranma again; Ranma struggled to push  her back.   "I've got to stop  this."  Ranma said, looking at the  bowl.  An idea popped into her  mind.  Ranma jumped to the floor, rolling.  She grabbed the bowl and ran upstairs,  hoping there was a sink or something.   Shampoo followed.</p><p>Shampoo entered Ranma's room, looking around  carefully.  Everything was quiet.  "Ranma, is no use hiding. I know café very  good."  No answer.  Something touched Shampoo's shoulder.  It was Ranma, looking fiercely at her.</p><p>"Ok, Shampoo, this ends now!" Ranma said, dousing  her with the water.  What little Shampoo  was wearing fell to the ground, making a sort of circle around the little cat  that stood there.  Ranma, fearing for  her life again, fled in terror.</p><p>"Ugh.<i>I hate cats</i>!"  She said to herself, having found herself back down stairs.  "I would rather face that cat Shampoo than  the real one though."  She filled up  another glass just incase.  Shampoo  bounded down the stairs, meowing.</p><p>" back !  If you try to force yourself on me again, I'll just   pouring water on you."  Ranma's voice  was showing her fear.  The cat looked at  Ranma, huddled in a corner, shaking with fear.   Shampoo had lost for now.  She  pranced over to the barred door and lay there, looking at Ranma.</p><p>Ranma made a motion towards it.  Shampoo arose and approached her.  Ranma was taken back by fear and fled back  to her corner.</p><p>"Oh  is just great," she said to herself.</p><p>Ranma remained huddled in his corner until the sun  started to come up. Shampoo almost smiled to him, if a cat could even  accomplish such a feat.</p><p>"Oh   isn't gonna like this." Ranma thought</p><p>Akane awoke suddenly; the sun was already up.  "Oh no, I must have fallen asleep again"  Akane leapt to her feet.  She suddenly  remembered about her wound.  She winced  a bit, and then just shook off the pain.   "I've got more important things to worry about other than some stupid  old cut."  Akane looked around for her  papers.  They had fallen off the bed;  some laying a few feet away and the others had gone under the bed.  "Oh, I still haven't figured out this stupid  translation."  Akane grabbed her papers  and books and continued to figure out the meaning of those words.  Hours passed like minutes.</p><p>"Yes! I did it.   Well most of it."  Akane  exclaimed.  She reread her notes.  Yes, that picture definitely showed a  duel.  Kasumi entered her room, carrying  a plate of food.</p><p>"You did  what, Akane?"</p><p>"I figured how to stop Shampoo from marrying Ranma."</p><p>"Oh, that's just wonderful!  What do you have to do?"</p><p>"Well, it's like this."  Akane said, indicating the drawings in that tome she had  found.  "Ranma beat Shampoo, and  therefore Shampoo has to marry him.   Now, I also want to marry Ranma, so that presents a problem.  Under this Amazon law I just found called  "Duel of the Fates" I will issue a challenge to Shampoo before her marriage and  she must comply.  If I beat her I can  marry Ranma."</p><p>"Oh my!  Are  you sure you can beat Shampoo with your wound?"</p><p>"Oh, don't worry about me Kasumi, I'll be fine"  Akane said, smiling.</p><p>"Well don't be to hasty Akane, are you sure you know  what you're doing?"</p><p>"Well, I translated most of it and I think I have  the general idea.  It's your basic duel.  What could go wrong?"</p><p>"Ok, Akane!" Kasumi said, smiling broadly.  "I brought you lunch, you haven't eaten in  forever."</p><p>"Thanks Kasumi." Akane did a double take.  "Lunch?   Oh no!"  Akane whirled to her  clock.  It was 12:11  "The ceremony! It's probably almost  over!"  Akane threw on some clothes and  raced down stairs, headed to the café, notes in hand.  Kasumi stood in her room.</p><p>"Hurry back Akane, I'll have dinner ready for  you!"  She said, smiling at nothing in  particular.  Genma and Soun noticed the  racing Akane.  They looked at each other  and nodded.  There was no separating  Ranma and Akane.</p><p>"Man, where is Akane?"  Ranma thought to himself, sitting on a chair, looking around at  the altar.  It was covered in a strange  cloth, lined with all kinds of fruits.   "She better hurry up.  I couldn't  stand Shampoo for the rest of my life."   Cologne went on, speaking some weird language.  Mousse was there too.   Shampoo bribed him to be a witness.   Ranma looked over to Mousse, who seemed to be taking this pretty well.  "I wonder what's up with that guy?   Usually he would have tried to kill me at least four times by now.  Does he know something I don't?"</p><p>Akane arrived at the café.  There was no turning back now.   She would get Ranma back or <i>die</i> trying.  She tried to open the door.   It was locked.  "Figures they  would try to lock me out.  Well I'll  just do this the hard way."</p><p>Ranma whirled as he heard a tremendous crash coming  from the entrance.  Akane stood there, a  bit of pain in her face but much better than she had been.  The door that had blocked Akane stood open,  the glass had broken with the force of the impact.</p><p>"Well, it's about time Akane." Ranma said.  "What kept you so long?"</p><p>"Well, <i>Ranma</i>, I did have to learn Amazonian  to save you.  If you want, I can leave  you with Shampoo the rest of your life."</p><p>"Uh, no that's ok Akane.  Just get me outta here."</p><p>"Nothing you can do save Ranma, Akane." Shampoo  said.  Cologne stood at the makeshift  altar.  She seemed a bit worried.</p><p>"Oh Yea, Shampoo?   Well I, Akane Tendou, challenge you to "The Duel of the Fates!"</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane.  "Is that the best you can do?   A duel?  It took a whole day to  think of a duel?  You have no idea what  I went through."</p><p>"Ranma, you idiot, this isn't just a duel.  It's..."</p><p>Cologne cut Akane off.  "Yes, son-in-law, this is the highest challenge an opponent can  issue.  Akane swears that the fates have  selected her to be your wife, while Shampoo claims the same thing.  Only a duel will resolve this."  Shampoo turned and smiled at Akane.</p><p>"Finally, Shampoo get revenge on Akane."</p><p>Ranma's stared at Akane in disbelief.  "Akane!   What were you thinking? What about your wound?"</p><p>Akane's remained resolved.</p><p>"Geeze Akane, sometimes you can be so dense."  Ranma turned to Cologne.  "This is all a mistake isn't it?  They really don't have to fight each other,  do they?"</p><p>"Son-in-law, you do not grasp the severity of the  challenge.  Shampoo is held by sacred  law to combat Akane.  If she does not,  she would give up her would-be husband to Akane.  Akane is the one that issued the challenge.  If she refuses to fight, then she loses by  default.  The challenge has been issued,  there <i>is</i> no turning back."</p><p>Akane stood there; if she had to fight for Ranma  then she would, even in her current condition.   Ranma ran over to Akane</p><p>"  isn't it?  There's no way you can win in your current  condition."</p><p>Akane nodded, focused on Shampoo.</p><p>"You would risk your life just to save me from  marrying Shampoo?"</p><p>"Yes Ranma.   I had a dream last night that made me realize how I felt about you.  Ranma.'t live without you.  If I can't marry  I can't be by your  side.I <i>would</i> rather die."   Akane's focus remained in tact, except for a stray tear that made its  way out.</p><p>"Akane.I had no idea you felt that way."  Ranma said, looking into her eyes.  Akane's eyes were focused on Shampoo.  She knew that if she looked at Ranma tears  would soon follow.</p><p>Ranma noticed that she was not looking at him.  He grabbed her shoulders and shook her once,  rather hard.  "Hey Akane! Look at me  when I'm speaking to you.  Did you even  think about how I would feel if I lost you?"   Ranma said, sternly.  Akane tried  hard not to look into his eyes, but she couldn't help it.</p><p>"Ranma.I'm  is something I <i>have</i> to  do.  You said that you wanted to get rid  of everyone pestering you.  Well, here's  your chance.  If Shampoo loses, then she  will stop bothering you.  If I lose,  then I would stop bothering you."</p><p>"Akane<i>!</i> You didn't bother me.  In fact, I loved being around you, even when  you were yelling at me.  I would hate to  lose you like this."</p><p>Akane's focus returned.  "Stop Ranma!" She demanded.   "You're only making it harder for me.   You were always fighting for me; trust me to do the same.  This is something <i>I</i> want to do.  It's not for you, it's for me."</p><p>"What are you talkin' about, "it's for you?""</p><p>"Ranma, you always tried to protect me, like I was  weak or something.  I have to prove to  everyone that I can take care of myself and make my own decisions."</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane.  "You knew exactly what you were doing, didn't you?"  He asked.   No answer.  "You knew that this  was risking your life, but you tried to say that you didn't know.  You can't fool me Akane!  I wont allow you to go through with this."</p><p>"Ranma, didn't you hear Cologne.  If I don't go through with this I'll give up  our wedding together."</p><p>"Yea Akane, but this is stupid.  There is no need to risk your life for me,  especially in your current condition, you could hardly run all the way here,  could you?"</p><p>No answer.</p><p>"Akane, don't be such a stupid tomboy.  This is for real."</p><p>Akane had had enough.  She struck Ranma in the chest with her fist.  Ranma was sent backwards.  He looked at Akane.  That was the hardest thing she ever had to do.  Ranma gave up trying to talk to her.</p><p>"Fine, go ahead and kill yourself over your stupid  pride!  Damn stubborn macho chick."</p><p>Akane ignored Ranma and stared at Shampoo.  Shampoo stared back, with a menacing smile.</p><p>"It is decided."   Cologne began.  "The "Duel of the  Fates" will take place.  According to  sacred law, the opponents have five days to prepare.  On the sixth day they will meet on a field chosen by the  challenger.  The would-be husband shall  remain at the challenged home for the duration of the five days.  He will be present during the duel.  Whoever wins shall take Ranma's hand in  marriage.  There is no backing out of  this.  Doing so on either side shall  result in their immediate loss by default.   Until  wedding is canceled."</p><p>Ranma turned to Akane, as if trying one last time to  convince her that there may be another way.   Akane remained steadfast in her duty.   She glanced one last time at Ranma.   "See you in five days, Shampoo" she said, turning around and leaving the  café.</p><p>Ranma sat down, trying not to believe what just  happened. It was no use.  "This is   these stupid rules," he thought to himself.  "Akane is so stupid, risking herself to save me.  Like I needed saving in the first place."</p><p>Mousse,  whom was very calm during all this, walked by Ranma, heading for the exit;  "Hey Saotome" He said to him quietly.  "I'm hoping that Akane wins."</p><p>"What are you talkin' about?"  Ranma said, looking up to a solemn Mousse.</p><p>"Don't, worry Saotome.  I have a few tricks up my sleeve.  No one will die, I promise you."   With that Mousse left the café, leaving Cologne and Shampoo to train and  Ranma to worry for five days.</p><p>"I wonder what that Mousse character is up to.  Maybe I should trust him.  But Akane's life is a big price to pay."</p><p>Ranma went up to the large cake that stood on a  nearby table.  He picked up the little  figures and broke them in his hand.  <i>Now</i>  he could have a piece of cake.  He cut a  small slice and brought a piece up to his mouth.  A bit of frosting fell on his shirt.  He looked down.  "Wait a  second.  I should <i>not</i> be around  while I'm male."  Ranma went up stairs,  soaking his head in cold water.  He was  pretty used to being female now. Besides, staying female may keep Shampoo away  for a bit longer.  After all, Akane was  probably pissed of at him again.  Maybe  he should stay away for just a while. Who cares about stupid rules any  way?  The now female Ranma fell onto her  bed, eating the cake slowly, and pondering what Akane would do.</p><p>"Well, at least this cake is pretty good." She said.</p><p>***** Yay! How about that for a fourth chapter? Hope  you guys liked it. I've noticed a few mentions of the word "Cliffhanger". Well,  I really didn't think the end of chapter three was a cliffhanger.  you  want cliffhangers, just wait a few chapters. Now THOSE are cliffhangers. Hehe. Anyway.  I have kinda mixed emotions about this chapter. It was good the first time, but  in changing the tone of the story, it more fits the theme than it did the first  time. What I'm saying is, this version fits a lot better than the other one,  but.I dunno. It's not quite as solid as I wanted it. And I guess it never will  be as long as I put in my personal feelings on characters. Can anyone guess how  I felt about Shampoo about a year ago?   But things change, as they tend to do. I hope everything fits well  enough. And as a set up for the next three chapters, I'm a huge Akane fan! The next  fanfiction of mine is centralized around her. She's so cute! So, that explains  those chapters. I guess I'm done now. Sorry for the delay in posting, but I couldn't  get the comp with me working nights this week. I swear. If I have to do this  again, I'm stepping down from scanning. I can't type like this. And I spend the  whole of my days bored. So anyway. Until next we meet!******</p>
