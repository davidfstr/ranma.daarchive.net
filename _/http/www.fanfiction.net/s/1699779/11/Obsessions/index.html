</div><p>Chapter  Eleven</p><p><u>Happy  Birthday Ranma!</u></p><p>About a month had passed since the cookie  incident.  Ranma and Akane's  relationship continued to grow, albeit at a very slow pace.  Akane's sign was changed back to the way it was,  and she soon forgot about what had happened only a month ago.  School was over, granting her more time to  train.  She trained very hard on mastery  of her skills.  Ranma also began to  train, worried that Akane might one day surpass him.  Akane still could not beat Ranma, but that didn't stop her from  trying.  Their fathers decided once and  for all to stop trying to rush their children.   Doing so may only slow the process.</p><p>Akane awoke at her usual time that first day of  school break.  She sat up, looking  around a bit.  Her clock said 7:02 am.  She turned to her calendar.  It was the second of June.  She got up and walked over to it.  The ninth had a small red circle around  it.  In red were the letters "Ranma's  birthday."  Akane smiled to  herself.  Just one more week was left.</p><p>"I wonder what he would like…well first of all, I  better find a way to buy something."   Akane said to herself.   She  changed from her pajamas, into her orange dress.  The orange would match perfectly with the late spring day that  was forming.  She opened her door and went  outside.  Nabiki was lying on her bed  with the door open. Akane approached the room, knocking on the open door.</p><p>"Hey…is Ranma up yet?"  Akane asked.</p><p>"No sis he's still asleep.  You know how he loves to sleep in."</p><p>"Ok. Thanks Nabiki."  Akane said, spying the magazine that she was reading.  "Hey, what is that?"</p><p>Nabiki turned to Akane and smiled.  "Just trying to spend a little bit of money  sis.  This is a catalog for that new  department store that opened up last week."</p><p>"Oh…" Akane said, approaching the bed.  Nabiki made room for her so she could also  read the magazine.</p><p>The magazine was filled with all kinds of  stuff.  Mainly clothes.  Of course there were selections of candies,  jewelry, even a section of the store dedicated to Anime.</p><p>Nabiki looked to Akane, she seemed more into her  search than she was.</p><p>"Hey Akane…what's up?"  Nabiki asked, curious.</p><p>"Huh?"  She  asked, rising form the pages of the magazine.   "What are you talking about?"</p><p>"Well, you seem to really be into this  magazine.  Usually you would have  nothing to do with clothes and jewelry and chocolates and stuff," Nabiki said  smiling</p><p>"Oh…well, it's a week until Ranma's birthday, and I  thought I should think about getting him something."</p><p>"Oh, why didn't you say so Akane!''  Nabiki said, smiling broadly.  "I have got the perfect gift right in here,  saw it right before you came in…" Nabiki started to flip through a few  pages.  She pointed the gift out to  Akane, who promptly rolled her eyes.  It  was a selection of fine lingerie and seductive clothing.</p><p>"Yea…like I would be caught dead wearing that  stuff."  She said</p><p>"Oh, come one Akane, wearing that one night wouldn't  hurt your relationship with Ranma.  Guys  love that kinda stuff anyways."</p><p>"Really?"   Akane asked, almost seriously.   "Well…I guess so.  But sister,  wouldn't that be kinda forward of me, showing up dressed like that to an  unprepared Ranma?  I mean…wouldn't he…"</p><p>"Go crazy?   Yea he would!"  Nabiki said,  finishing her sentence for her.  "Just  imagine the look on his face when he saw you in something like this.''  Nabiki pointed to a piece that did not leave  a lot to the imagination.</p><p>Akane scoffed.   "Yea right.  If I were to pose in  that for Ranma, he would check my temperature, then do something stupid to ruin  the moment.  Then he would call me  un-cute for giving him what he deserved."</p><p>"Oh, come on Akane…" Nabiki said, nudging her a  bit.  "Don't tell me there isn't some  side of you that isn't the least bit curious…"</p><p>Akane turned to the smiling Nabiki.  She started to blush a bit.  "Well…I guess that I could…wait a  second!  I have <i>no</i> intentions of  wearing something like that, especially for Ranma.  He didn't deserve to see me like that!  Besides…that is <i>so</i> not like me to…"</p><p>"What didn't I deserve?"  Came a voice from the door.   Akane turned, spying Ranma, smiling confidently.  Akane trailed off her words…a bit  embarrassed.</p><p>"Oh, Akane was planning on wearing this for  you!"  Nabiki said, holding up the  magazine to Ranma.  Akane, shocked,  tried to snatch the magazine away from her.   Ranma entered Nabiki's room, curious.</p><p>Akane finally managed to get the magazine from  Nabiki, who was having fun tormenting her little sister.  Ranma approached Akane.</p><p>"So…what ya got there?"  He said, hands behind his back.</p><p>"It's <i>nothing</i> Ranma…just some clothes…" Akane  said, trying to feign control of the situation.</p><p>"Oh?   Well…what's that behind you?"   Ranma asked.  Akane turned  around, seeing a wall.  Ranma took that  moment to snatch the magazine, putting his finger in between the pages before  Akane could close them.  Ranma opened  the magazine, looking at all the different types of lingerie on display.</p><p>"Hey…Akane…what'cha' doing looking at somethin' like  this for?"  He asked.</p><p>Akane went for the magazine. Ranma dodged the  attempt.  "I wasn't looking at that Ranma…Nabiki  was…I just happened to be in here was all!"</p><p>"Wrong Akane."   Nabiki said slyly.  "Ranma, she  was saying stuff like,  "Oh, do you  think Ranma will like this?"  And "I'll  bet Ranma would die if he saw me in that!""   Akane whirled on Nabiki</p><p>"<i>Nabiki</i>!   You know I did <i>no</i> such thing.   All that kinda stuff is beneath me anyway.  I'm a martial artist first!"</p><p>Ranma went over to Nabiki.  "So which one was she looking at?" he asked.  Nabiki pointed.  Akane looked on, having given up her fight to get the  magazine.  It was too hard when Ranma  was fully on guard.  Ranma's eyes  widened when he saw what Nabiki was pointing at.  He turned to Akane, who was starting to blush a bit.  He compared the person in the magazine to  Akane a few times, going back and forth between them.</p><p>"You're right, I would've died if I saw you in  that…" Ranma said, seriously.</p><p>"R…really?"   Akane asked, seeming to think more about it.</p><p>"Yea definitely."   Ranma said.  "I would die from  fright if I saw you in that.  The top is  way too big if you ask me and…does it have a bottom piece?"  Nabiki helped out the struggling Ranma by  pointing it out.  He shuddered a bit.</p><p>"Nope…that one is made for more womanly women, not  Macho chicks."  Ranma said.  He and Nabiki flipped a few pages while  Akane seethed.</p><p>"What do you think about that one Ranma?"  Nabiki asked, trying to help things along.</p><p>Ranma examined it for a few seconds.  "Nah…Akane doesn't strike me as cute enough  to wear something like that."  Suddenly,  a pillow struck Ranma in the head.  The  pillow almost hurt.  He turned to Akane,  who was a bit angry to say the least.</p><p>"What did you do that for?"</p><p>"Maybe you should get some for yourself and  Kuno!"  Akane demanded.</p><p>"Yea…you're right.   I <i>would</i> look better in this than you" Ranma said, smiling.  Akane did not find it so funny.</p><p>"Hmph!"   Akane said, turning around and going downstairs.  Breakfast was almost ready.</p><p>After a few minutes, Kasumi called everyone to  breakfast.  Everyone sat down, eating  breakfast in a less hurried manner for once.   Ranma and Akane did not speak a word to each other, which was a pretty  common action.  Akane finished her  breakfast first and left to go train a bit.   Ranma finished his and started to watch TV.  Kasumi started her daily chores and Soun and Genma went to yet  another game of GO.</p><p><u>What to  get…</u></p><p>Akane stood, a stack of bricks before her.  There were about a dozen of them, all about  one inch thick.  That would be a good  warm up.  She took a few slow breaths  and raised her hand up.  "<i>Hiya</i>!"  She yelled, bringing her hand down on the  stack.  Her hand went clean through all  the bricks, sending a small cloud of dust in the air.  Satisfied, she went to go get a few more.  She felt something…  She turned around, seeing Nabiki watching  her from the entrance.</p><p>"Oh, hey sis.''   Akane said, approaching her.</p><p>"Hey…sorry about what happened earlier."  Nabiki said with a smile.</p><p>Akane took a towel and wiped her forehead.  "Hey, that's ok.  So what are you doing here?"</p><p>"Well…I just had a great idea.  Wanna come with me to that new store that we  were looking at.  Maybe you would find a  present for Ranma that way."</p><p>"Sure sister, let me take a quick bath and I'll be  right down."  Akane said, cleaning up  and going to the bathroom with a towel</p><p>After a few minutes, she came down, wearing a white  top and orange dress bottom.  Ranma was  standing next to Nabiki, talking.</p><p>"Ready to go Nabiki?"  She asked.</p><p>"Yea, I'm ready.'   Ranma said.</p><p>"Huh?  Who  asked <i>you</i> to go?"  Akane said,  staring at her.  She did a double  take.  Ranma was a female now.</p><p>"This place is kinda boring, besides, I kinda wanted  to check that place out."</p><p>"Well, don't hold us up Ranma."  Akane turned to Nabiki  "Lets go Nabiki."  Akane said, walking along side her.  Ranma followed casually.</p><p>After a little while, the three came to the  store.  Akane and Nabiki entered,  talking about something.  Ranma  followed, having seduced her way into another free snack.  Akane and Nabiki went off on by  themselves.  Ranma started wandering  around.</p><p>The sisters went about, trying on different clothes  and such, much like women do.  Ranma had  found her way there, wondering why they were making such a big deal out of  clothes.</p><p>She eyed Akane, who was modeling a cute little  dress.  It was similar to the ones she  had; only this one was red, with flowing fabric.</p><p>"What do you think Ranma?"  Akane asked, cheerfully turning around so Ranma could see the  whole dress.</p><p>"Hmm…I dunno Akane.   Aren't your hips too big for that one?"</p><p>"Wh…what are you talking about?"  Akane said, examining her backside in the  mirror.</p><p>"Well…look at this."  Ranma said, pointing.   "This dress is made for more feminine waists and hips. You know…for a  woman.  You have strong, man-like hips,  and they really don't add anything to this."</p><p>Akane whirled on Ranma, crossing her arms.  "Hmph, well I suppose <i>you</i> could wear  this better than I could, considering your more woman-like than me!"</p><p>"You're right, I <i>could</i> wear it better than  you could."  Ranma retaliated.</p><p>"Fine!"   Akane said, going back into the dressing room.  She emerged a few moments later, gripping the dress hard.</p><p>"Here you go Ranma!"  She said, throwing it to her.   Ranma caught it, skillfully. She looked down at it a second.</p><p>"H…hey…wait a second.  I'm not gonna put this on.   You gotta be crazy!"</p><p>"Well, you're the one that said you would fit into  it better than me.  Lets see whom it  really fits better, a real woman or you.''</p><p>"I dunno who you are callin' a real woman, but it's <i>certainly</i>  not you!  Besides, I can't go in there."</p><p>"Why not Ranma?"   Nabiki asked.  She was a bit  curious too.</p><p>"Well…that's a girls dressing room."</p><p>"So…you're a girl now aren't you?  That never stopped you before.  You seem to have used that side of you to  get a quick snack didn't you?"  Akane  asked.</p><p>"Yea…but this is different though.  This isn't some poor guy desperate for a  date."</p><p>"Yea…a guy would have to be pretty desperate to ask  you out."</p><p>"Yea, whatever, remember Akane, I'm the cutest one  here!"</p><p>"You are not cute!   Not with that attitude of yours."</p><p>"Oh, you're one to talk about attitude Akane!"</p><p>It was at this point that people began to notice the  argument.</p><p>"So prove it and we will see which one is cuter!"</p><p>"But…I can't…"</p><p>Nabiki nudged Ranma.  "Go for it <i>girl</i>.   You fit the part don't you?  Just  don't look at anything, look at the floor or something.  Besides, it's not like you haven't seen that  kinda stuff before.  You were starting  to get into that lingerie stuff."</p><p>"N…no I wasn't.   I was just picturing Akane wearin…" Ranma cut himself off, Akane was  already angry enough.</p><p>"What were you doing?"  She asked, with a hint of anger.</p><p>Ranma smiled nervously.  "Uh… I was…tryin' to figure out what one would best suit  your…manly physique!"</p><p>Akane seethed.   "Well Ranma, why not show me how it's done?"  She said with a menacing smile.</p><p>"Fine…I'll show you what a tomboy you really  are."  Ranma said, closing her eyes and  going inside, albeit reluctantly.</p><p>She came out after a few minutes, displaying all she  had.</p><p>Akane stood next to Nabiki, angrily looking at  Ranma.  Ranma smiled.  "See, I am the cuter one!  This fits my form a lot better than you"</p><p>Akane narrowed her eyes at the boasting Ranma.  Nabiki nudged her.  "It <i>does</i> look better on her sis," she whispered.</p><p>"Who cares what that pervert looks like  anyway!"  Akane shouted, storming off to  another part of the store.</p><p>"Violent tomboy…" Ranma said.  "I'm going home, it was a mistake for me to  follow you two."  She said, changing  back into her normal clothes and returning to the Dojo.</p><p>"That Ranma!"   Akane said to herself.  "Always  has to show off how perverted he really is.   That dress didn't suit him any ways.   Maybe I should get him that dress for his birthday."  Akane looked back to where Ranma was.  She was leaving.  Nabiki went about trying on a few more things.  She knew that was going to happen.</p><p>Akane cooled off a bit and began her search for a  gift for Ranma.  It didn't take her long  to spy something in the men's wear section.   It was a shirt, kind of a dark bluish color that looked very nice.  It looked like it a Chinese style of  clothing.</p><p>"Hey Nabiki, come here a sec!"  Akane called to her.  Nabiki walked over, her handbag had a few  things in it.</p><p>"What is it Akane?"</p><p>"What do you think…for Ranma?"  Akane said, indicating the shirt.</p><p>Nabiki stood back, her hand on her chin, and turning  her head every which way.  "I think that  is perfect for Ranma.  That's just his  size isn't it?"</p><p>"Yea."  Akane  nodded, smiling.  "I think it would look  very sharp on him, but we need something else…" Akane said, looking at the  pants.</p><p>Nabiki watched her sister go from rack to rack.  "She is gonna make a good wife to Ranma…if  she ever decides to calm down a bit."   She thought to herself.</p><p>"What do you think about this?"  Akane asked, holding up a pair of  pants.  They were a dark blue, almost  black color.  They also were loose  fitting, just like the kinds Ranma would wear.</p><p>"Yep…I think that's the perfect combo there  Akane."  Nabiki said, smiling.</p><p>Akane went to the price tags.  The shirt was 10,200-yen and the pants were  7850-yen.</p><p>Akane looked a bit down.  That was almost 20,000-yen.   She didn't have enough to get the set.   She could always borrow from Nabiki…but she had done that so much…</p><p>"What's wrong Akane?  Need some money?"</p><p>"Oh…well I'm kinda short on yen, this would prolly  cost almost 20,000-yen."</p><p>"Well…I suppose…" Nabiki began</p><p>"No, don't worry about it Nabiki, I still have a  whole week to get the money.  I'll  figure out something."</p><p>"Well, suit yourself then.  I'm going back to the Dojo."</p><p>"Ok, let me put this stuff back, I'll be right  there"</p><p>Akane and Nabiki walked out the store.  Ranma was going to just love that little  combo deal in there.  All Akane had to  do was figure out a way to get the yen for it.</p><p>Akane lay in her bed later that night.  Her and Ranma were back on their normal  terms after their argument.  Akane  thought to the ninth of June.  "I need  to do something really special for Ranma on his birthday.  That little combo would suit him just  perfectly, but I gotta do something else though…My cooking is getting  better.  Maybe Kasumi could help me bake  him a cake."  Akane smiled to herself,  picturing Ranma going on and on about how good her cake <i>would</i> be.  "That will show him once and for all that I  could make something the right way."   Akane turned to her side, bringing her blanket up to her.  The next few days were going to be fun.</p><p>Akane awoke and ate breakfast with everyone.  Her sprits were high, along with everyone  else's.  She still needed to figure out  how to get the almost 20,000 yen needed to get Ranma's gift.  About noon, she set out, walking around town  by herself.  Ranma took this opportunity  to train a bit more.</p><p>Akane walked down the main street, pondering.  "Maybe I could get a real job.  Nah…I might have to work on Ranma's  birthday."  Akane spied Uc-Chan's Okonomiyaki  shop.  She was a bit hungry.  Akane entered the little shop.  Ukyo was there cleaning off her grill.  The lunch crowd had just left.  "Hey Ukyo!"   Akane waved.</p><p>"Oh, hey there sugar.  How you been?"</p><p>Akane sat down in front of the grill.  "Well…I'm in a little bit of a bind right  now…"</p><p>"Oh?  Why is  that?"  Ukyo asked, pausing her  cleaning.</p><p>"Well…the ninth is Ranma's birthday and I figured  out what to get him.  It's a shirt and  pants combo Nabiki and I found.  I think  Ranma would love it, it's just his size."</p><p>"So, what's the problem then?"</p><p>"Well…the combo costs 20,000 yen and I'm just a bit  short right now."</p><p>"How much are you short?"</p><p>"Uh…18,000 yen" Akane said sheepishly.</p><p>Ukyo just looked at Akane.  "That's not exactly a bit short…"</p><p>"Yea I know…"</p><p>Ukyo thought for a minute, stirring up an  Okonomiyaki for Akane.</p><p>"Hey…did you hear what that guy outside was  saying?"  She asked, flipping the  pancake.</p><p>"What guy?"</p><p>"That guy with the fliers across the street from  here.  I think its some sorta martial  arts contest.  With your new  techniques…"</p><p>"…I would surely win!"  Akane finished Ukyo's sentence.   "Thanks Ukyo!"  Akane said,  running outside to the person with the flyers.</p><p>"Hey, wait a sec Akane…You forgot your  Okonomiyaki."  Ukyo tried.  "Oh well, once her mind is set on something,  it's hard for her to think of anything else.   Maybe Ran-Chan would like a special birthday Okonomiyaki."</p><p>Akane walked back to the Dojo, reading the flyer:</p><p><i>"Come one come all!</i></p><p><i>Enter Nermia's premier  Martial Arts contest!  All schools  accepted!</i></p><p><i>Deadline for  registration is the third of June.

Then stop  by!  Amaze your friends!  Conquer your enemies!</i></p><p>Akane looked again at the note.</p><p>"Hmm…looks like there is a new Martial Arts school  in town.  I hope they are good.  I've never heard of the "Seven Swords" style  of martial arts."  Akane neared the  Dojo.  Something hit her, making her  stop in her tracks.</p><p>"Wait a second…today is the third of June!"</p><p>Ranma came out, eager for some fresh air.</p><p>"Hey Akane!   Where ya been all day?"  Ranma  asked with a bit of a smile.</p><p>"Uh…fine Ranma…I just remembered something I have to  do.  Excuse me."  Akane said, running off down the street.</p><p>"Hey, wait a minute Akane!  Dinner is gonne be ready in just a few… Geeze…whatever then"  Ranma said, returning to the Dojo.</p><p>Akane reached the Dojo where the contest would be  held.  The sign read:  "The Seven Swords School of Martial Arts"  There was a pretty long line for the registration.  Akane stood in the slow moving line, looking up into the  sky.  It was almost dinnertime.</p><p>After what seemed like an hour, Akane's turn came  up.  The man at the desk looked up at  her.  "I'm sorry miss.  Registration is closed for now.  Just missed the deadline."</p><p>Akane looked to the man, shocked.  "Wh…what?   What do you mean registration is closed?"</p><p>"Registration ends at 6 pm sharp.  I'm very sorry…"</p><p>Akane started to demand to be allowed in.  She thought back to what happened  yesterday.  "Ranma did win that cuteness  contest yesterday…if a guy could win that…then so could I!"  Akane said to herself, smiling to herself.</p><p>She took a look of extreme sadness.  She lowered her head.  "Ok mister…I understand…"She said  softly.  She turned around slowly.</p><p>"Hey…wait a second!   No need to cry over it."</p><p>Akane whirled around, look of extreme  disappointment.  "Why not?  I just wanted the money to buy my friend a  birthday present.  I guess I can't get  anything for her now…"</p><p>"Oh…come on pretty lady.  I guess I could make just one exception."</p><p>Akane sniffed.   "R…really?"</p><p>"Sure, what's the harm in one more person signing  up?"</p><p>Akane regained her composure instantly.  She took the 2000-yen and slammed it on the  table, smiling slyly. "I am Akane Tendou.   The heir to the "Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts!""</p><p><u>To Bake a  Cake</u></p><p>Akane walked back to the Dojo, carrying her letter  of registration.  She was smiling  broadly.  "Eat that Ranma!  Who's the cute one now?"  Maybe there <i>were</i> advantages to being  cute.</p><p>Ranma jumped in front of her.  "Hey, what's with the big smile?"</p><p>"Oh…nothing."   Akane said simply.</p><p>"I hope you don't think you're cuter like that."</p><p>"Nope…not in the slightest.  I'm as un-cute as the come."  Akane said, still with her smile.</p><p>Ranma did a double take.  "Well, you're just jealous that you can't match my cuteness.  And I'm not even a real woman"</p><p>"You're right Ranma…I have no chance of matching <i>your</i>  cuteness.  You are more woman than I'll  ever be."  Akane said, walking past  him.  Ranma was a bit stunned.</p><p>"H…hey Akane!   You sick or somethin'?"</p><p>"Nope…I feel just fine."  Akane said, continuing her walk.</p><p>"Ok…where is the real Akane?"  Ranma asked, putting his hand on her  shoulder.  Akane turned around</p><p>"Gotcha!"   She said, turning around and tapping Ranma on the nose with a big  smile.  Ranma looked at her confused.</p><p>"Geeze…well someone here is in a good mood for a  change.  Maybe you <i>could</i> be  cute…when you wanted to."</p><p>"Ranma…you have no idea…" Akane said, continuing to  the Dojo.  Ranma followed her.</p><p>"I wonder what she meant by that?"  Ranma asked himself.</p><p>Everyone sat down for dinner.  They had waited for Ranma and Akane to come  back.  Akane was in a very good  mood.  Ranma also found himself in a  good mood.  That made everyone happy.</p><p>Ranma awoke late the next morning.  It was about 10:14 am.  He sniffed the air.  Breakfast sure smelled really good.  Ranma got up, changing into his day clothes  and going down stairs.  Everyone else  had finished breakfast.  Ranma looked  around.  Akane wasn't there.</p><p>"Hey Pops…where's Akane at?"  He asked.   Genma pointed to the kitchen.   Soun took that opportunity to "make his move'' in their game of GO.  Ranma turned to the kitchen, just as Akane  emerged, wearing an apron.  She was  untying it.</p><p>"Ok Kasumi.   I'll be right back!"  She said  happily.  She noticed Ranma was looking  at her, he dreaded what was in store for the household.  "Good morning Ranma!"</p><p>"Oh…uh…good morning Akane." Ranma said softly.</p><p>"What's with that long face Ranma?"</p><p>"Well…you dressed in an apron and coming out the  kitchen is never a good sign."</p><p>"Well Ranma…what's in the kitchen has <i>nothing</i>  to do with you so you don't have to worry about it."</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane, confused  "What'cha talkin' about Akane?"</p><p>"Exactly what I said," Akane returned, going up  stairs.</p><p>"Feh…whatever."   Ranma said under his breath.  He  went into the kitchen.  It smelled kind  of funny.  He looked around.  Nothing that was identifiable was around,  just a bunch of mysterious shapes sitting on plates.  Ranma suddenly felt relieved.   "Good thing this has nothing to do with me.  Everyone else is gonna be in trouble."</p><p>Ranma stepped outside, taking in the morning.  A few clouds were in the sky, but nothing  much else.  Ranma decided to take a  little walk, seeing as Akane was <i>so</i> busy cooking.</p><p>And so was the story for the next few days.  Akane would wake up early, practicing her  cooking skills and then go off later in the day to train.  Sometimes Ranma would help her.  Other times, he would just be bored  somewhere, watching TV</p><p>Akane woke up early on the seventh.  She smiled, looking at her calendar, just  one more day until she would get the prize money.  She changed into her day clothes and went down stairs.  Breakfast was the perfect time to practice;  seeing as Kasumi's good cooking would cover up hers.</p><p>Akane entered the kitchen.  Kasumi had laid out all the ingredients for her.   All that was left for her to do was put  them together in the right order.  Akane  tightened her apron.  This was going to  be a fight to the finish.</p><p>"Oh, good morning Akane!"  Kasumi said happily.</p><p>"Good morning Kasumi" Akane said, getting her focus.</p><p>Kasumi looked at her, concerned.  "Akane…this is not a fight.  Cooking should come from your feelings of  love and happiness.  Not from your  feelings of anger."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Our mother always used to say that.  Cook from your heart and the rest will  follow."</p><p>Akane nodded slowly.  "Ok…from the heart huh?"   She asked herself.  "Ok…here I  go!"  Akane grabbed the bag of flour,  dumping it into a bowl.  The flour dust  covered her apron almost completely.   She put in the rest of the dry ingredients and started to stir them,  vigorously, sending a cloud of dust into the air.</p><p>"Akane, wait just a second."  Kasumi said, placing her hands on her  shoulders.  "You're starting to lose  your temper again."</p><p>Akane snapped her head around.  Kasumi was right.</p><p>"Well, the stupid flour won't stay in the bowl long  enough for me to mix the ingredients."</p><p>Kasumi smiled.   "Here…let me show you and easier way to do that."</p><p>She went and grabbed a sifter.  She emptied the flour mixture into another  bowl.  She gently poured the mixture in  the sifter, tapping it softly with her hand.   The powder fell into the bowl very neatly.  Akane looked on, watching the smiling Kasumi work her magic.</p><p>"Here…you try it now.'' Kasumi said, handing the  sifter to Akane.  She took it and  started tapping it gently.  It  worked!  Akane smiled.</p><p>Akane went on to add her wet ingredients and started  stirring them all together.  Satisfied  with the consistency, she poured the mixture into a pan and went to the  oven.  Kasumi stopped her.</p><p>"What did we talk about yesterday Akane?"  Akane was again confused.  "You must taste your cooking before you cook  it.  That way you know what to expect  when it's done."  Kasumi said with a big  smile.  She stuck her finger into the  batter and licked it.  Kasumi paused for  just a second.</p><p>"Let's start that one over shall we Akane?"  Kasumi said cheerfully.</p><p>Akane looked at her batter.  It looked ok.  She proceeded to taste it.   It was awful.</p><p>"Kasumi…where did I go wrong?"  Akane said, sadly.  Kasumi took another taste.</p><p>"Well, for starters, you forgot the sugar.  No one likes the taste of just flour.  Second, you put in a bit too much baking  power.  That stuff does not taste so  good."  Kasumi took another taste.  "Another thing.  Just because a recipe calls for a pinch of salt doesn't mean you  have to add enough to taste it.  It also  seems like there is a bit of soy sauce in here…"</p><p>Akane turned to Kasumi; a tear came down her  cheek.  "I thought that was vanilla  extract…"</p><p>"Oh, come on now Akane.  This isn't like you.   Let's try again!"  Kasumi's warm  smile melted away the tears in Akane's eyes.   She smiled.</p><p>"Yea lets go again."</p><p>Kasumi severed breakfast.  Akane had successfully completed a cake, although she forgot to  put in the eggs and the cake collapsed upon cutting it.  It was still pretty good, at least according  to Akane.  Satisfied with her latest  attempt, she went to go train for a little.   The day passed fast.  Akane  eagerly awaited tomorrow and all that would happen.</p><p><u>Surprise!</u></p><p>Akane sprung out of bed the next morning.  She turned to her clock.  8:31 am.   She had plenty of time.  Akane  dressed in her shorts and went for a quick warm up jog around town.</p><p>Akane came back about an hour later.  Everyone was up and about.  She wiped her forehead and entered the Dojo,  breathing heavily.  Ranma threw her a  towel, smiling at her.</p><p>"Oh…hey Ranma."   Akane said.</p><p>"Hey Akane."   Ranma returned.</p><p>The two looked at each other for a second.  Something was different about Ranma.</p><p>"Well…what do you want Ranma?"  Akane asked, wiping her face with the towel.</p><p>"Uh…well…I was wonderin' today is such a nice  day.  You wanna go see a movie or  somethin' this afternoon?  There is a  new American movie playing, it's called <i>The Matrix</i>.  It looks pretty nice, so I wanted to see if  you wanted to come along."</p><p>"Uh…well Ranma…I kinda had plans today…" Akane said,  sadly.</p><p>Ranma looked disappointed.  "Oh…well…its ok then.  Not  like I really wanted <i>you</i> to go or anything, just thought it would be  nice to have someone to tag alone."</p><p>"I'm sorry Ranma.   It's kinda important.  I can't  miss what I have planned."</p><p>Ranma smiled that confident smile, but something was  different about it.  "Hey, it's ok  Akane.  Well I'm gonna eat  breakfast."  He said, going to the  dinner table.  Akane followed him.  It would have been nice to go to the movies  with Ranma, but she had the contest…</p><p>Akane finished her breakfast and lingered around the  training hall, focusing on her task at hand.   The time slowly ticked away.  It  was time to leave.  Akane went into her  room.  "If I left in my Gi, everyone  would be suspicious.  I better change  into it at the other Dojo."  With that,  Akane slipped on her blue dress and walked outside, carrying a small bag.</p><p>Ranma watched her.   "I wonder what she is up to.  I  think she's hiding something from me."   Ranma followed Akane at a distance.   She was going to another Dojo.   He watched as she went to the little table.  The guy at the table shook his head.  Akane indicated her bag.   The guy let her in.  Ranma went  up a near by tree, providing an excellent view of the platform in the back yard  of the dojo.</p><p>Akane wandered around for a few minutes, having  dressed in her yellow Gi.  She smiled to  herself.  This would be easy.  She looked to the number she had drawn.  Number nine.  The announcer called for the first match.  Number nine and number one were up.</p><p>"That's me!"   Akane said to herself.  She  approached the platform.   It was one of  those "out of the ring and you lose" things.   Of course a knockout meant you would lose too, but Akane had not  intentions of losing. She stood at the far side or the platform.  She took a deep breath.  She cleared her mind.  She was focused.</p><p>"Truly…such a boorish lot" a voice began.  The crowd went silent.  "It is clear that each person here wishes to  demonstrate their strength against less than worthy opponents.  I scoff at such attempts.  Only one person has the courage…no the duty  to truly win.  That person is I, the  rising star of the Furinkan High school Kendo club.  Men tremble at my feet.  Babies  cry at the mere mention of my name, for I Tatewaki Kuno, the Blue Thunder of  Furinkan High, have arrived."</p><p>Akane just stared at her first opponent; her jaw  hanging slightly open.</p><p>Kuno looked over to her.  "Oh…Akane Tendou.  You  have relinquished yourself from the vile Ranma Saotome and have come to this  tournament seeking my love.  Very well  then.  If it is my love you seek, you  shall have it, unconditionally."</p><p>Akane blinked a few times.  "K…Kuno…?"</p><p>"You needen't confess your love of me here Akane  Tendou!"  Kuno said, stopping her with  his sword.  "You need not tell me of  your desire to date with me.  But these  people came for a show and a show they shall have.  If you manage to defeat me, I shall allow you to dat…"</p><p>Akane leapt into the air, coming down with a swift  kick, right in Kuno's mouth.  The blow  sent him sliding out of the ring. He was out cold.</p><p>Akane turned her back, tightening her belt.  "Honestly, that Kuno has <i>got</i> to get a  clue.  That speech of his is getting  old."  She just went back to the  contestant waiting room.  No looking at  others' moves.  She was in the second  division waiting area.</p><p>Ranma looked on.   "Wow…Akane didn't hold back on that last one.  Serves Kuno right!"</p><p>The competitors dwindled down slowly.  Finally, it was time for the final  match.  Akane smiled to herself.  "This is gonna be good."  The announcer called contestant nine and  contestant twenty-seven out.</p><p>Akane entered the ring.  She smiled to the crowd, who was going crazy for her.  She looked to her opponent.  Her opponent waved a curious looking weapon  around, receiving applause.  It was a  giant spatula.</p><p>"Ukyo?"   Akane asked.  "What are you doing  here?"</p><p>"Akane!  Hey  sugar.  Surprised?"  Ukyo said, turning to her with a smile.</p><p>"Well yea…I didn't think you were into martial arts  that much."</p><p>"Well, my passion is still Okonomiyaki, but when I  saw you enter the fight, I couldn't resist the opportunity to spar with you  again.  Besides, if I won, I could put  Uc-Chan's on the map."</p><p>Akane smiled.   "Well, I'm not gonna hold back on you.   We all have our reasons for winning. I need that prize money."</p><p>"Don't underestimate me Akane.  The past month I've spent a little time in  the "Seven Swords" Dojo.  I think I have  gotten a little better."</p><p>"I hope so.   Let's give this crowd something to cheer about."  Akane said, taking her stance.</p><p>Ukyo nodded, following suit.</p><p>"Begin!"</p><p>The two combatants stared at each other for a few  seconds.  Ukyo was the first to lead  off.  She charged Akane, un sheathing  her giant spatula.  She swung violently  at Akane.  Akane leapt into the air,  coming down with a kick.  Ukyo used her  massive spatula to absorb the blow.  The  kick did send her back a few steps.   Akane ran towards her.  She  launched a right to Ukyo.  Ukyo dodged  it rather easily. Akane launched a left. Ukyo brought up her spatula, hitting  Akane's fist and making it soar off to the left.  She twirled her spatula, bringing the circular end of it within  inches of Akane's face.  Akane felt the  cold of the steel that was too close to her face.  Akane back flipped away.   Ukyo stood at the other end, smiling triumphantly.</p><p>"Wow…Ukyo has got a bit faster in only one  month.  I better step this up a  notch."  Akane said, regaining her  focus.  Ukyo dashed to her position,  again swinging her spatula.  Akane  tilted her head slightly, avoiding the first blow.  Ukyo slashed again, seeming to have the spatula materialize in  the correct position.  Akane jumped  back.  A few of her hairs floated  briefly in front of her.  The spatula  had cut the front of her hair.</p><p>"Come on Akane!"   Ukyo said, continuing to slash away. "I know you're holding back, show  me what you got!"  Akane smiled, dodging  slashes.  If she wanted a real fight  then she would get it.  Akane narrowed  her eyes at the last swing.  An opening.  Akane launched her uppercut.  Ukyo was prepared.  She jumped to the ground, feeling the warmth from Akane's hand.  That was too close.  Ukyo rolled once, ending up crouched with  her back facing Akane.  She took the  spatula, swinging it behind her, hoping to trip Akane.  Akane sensed the steel weapon approaching  her.  She jumped, remaining in the same  place.  Ukyo swung her body around,  bringing her legs out, going for another trip.   Akane again jumped, turning to face Ukyo.  Ukyo had her.  She brought  the Spatula from the opposite direction it had first swung.  This time she swung high.  Akane bent backwards, placing her hands on  the ground.  Ukyo used the inertia of  the spatula to spin herself to a somewhat standing position. She brought the  spatula down hard to Akane's stomach.   Akane rolled desperately.  Her Gi  was torn, right across the stomach with just the wind from the weapon.  Ukyo ran after her, swinging down  again.  Akane rolled on her back.  She was too close to the edge.  She stuck her foot up; the foot found the  handle.  Akane kicked the wide end to  the spatula, sending it spinning into the air.   Ukyo, stunned, watched as Akane leapt to her feet and plucked the  spatula out of the air.  She let it rest  on her shoulder, turning to Ukyo and smiling broadly.  Ukyo was not so happy.</p><p>"Lets see how this thing works, shall we?"  Akane said, lashing out at Ukyo.  Ukyo back flipped, taking that moment to  grab several of her mini spatulas.   Akane charged.  Ukyo, on her  hands during this, flipped to her feet, throwing the mini spatulas at  Akane.  Akane stopped her assault.  She turned her head dodging one.  The rest where brought down with Ukyo's own  spatula.  Ukyo smiled.  She knew the weakness of the weapon was its  weight in the front.  She would use that  to her advantage.  Ukyo took the  offensive, much to Akane's surprise.   She launched a fist at Akane.   Akane blocked with the spatula.   Ukyo smiled again, sending a kick to Akane's head.  Akane leapt back, just short of getting  struck.</p><p>"I just need Akane to swing down at me with that  thing…then it's mine!"  Ukyo said to  herself.  She charged Akane.  Akane took her stance.  Ukyo hit the ground, sliding between Akane's  legs and placing a foot in her back.   Akane stumbled forward a bit.   She whirled around, bringing the spatula down on Ukyo.  Ukyo grabbed the handle and, using the  weapon's weight and Akane's own force, she flung Akane over her.  Akane relinquished control of the spatula,  landing perfectly.</p><p>Akane looked at Ukyo wiping the sweat from her forehead.  "Where did you learn all those moves  Ukyo?"  She said smiling</p><p>"Well…the "seven swords" school is one of my best  customers.  I went in there frequently  while they were training.  They taught  me a little bit, in exchange for Okonomiyaki."</p><p>"I see…that explains your swordsmanship with your  spatula."</p><p>"Yea…it does count as a sword, at least when I use  it for combat."  Ukyo said, winking.</p><p>"Well, time to stop playing around."  Akane said, noticing that Ukyo was back on  the assault.  "She may be faster but she  can't match the speed of my attacks."</p><p>"Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts  special attack!"  Akane said, more for  the crowd than any one else.  It did  have a certain ring to it however…</p><p>"<i>Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken</i>!"</p><p>Akane unleashed her attack on Ukyo.  Ukyo knew that was coming.  She stopped in her tracks.  At that last moment, Ukyo ducked the attack,  placing a foot in Akane's stomach.   Akane was sent back a few steps.   Ukyo won that round.</p><p>"That all you got Akane?"  Ukyo said playfully.</p><p>Akane just smiled slyly.</p><p>Suddenly, Ukyo felt a sting of pain in her  chest.  She had taken a few hits.  Hard hits too.  They would certainly bruise later.  She didn't fare as well as she had thought.  Ukyo shook off the pain.  "So you want special attacks huh?  Well try this one sugar!"  Ukyo said, taking her spatula and holding it  up at the twelve o clock position.</p><p>Akane stood there, having regained her breath.  "What is she doing?  There is no way she could have mastered the  Seven Swords arts in just a month!"</p><p>"Seven Sword's School of Martial Arts Special  Attack!"  Ukyo said, bringing the  spatula clockwise.</p><p>"<i>Wakareji Kyuuten</i>!"  (Parting of the Heavens)</p><p>Ukyo stopped the spatula at the 8 o clock  position.  The wind picked up  slightly.  Akane took a step back.  Ukyo ran towards her, trailing the spatula  behind her.  Akane focused in on the  attack.  Ukyo's form all of a sudden  split into three, ghostly looking forms, each rushing to her.</p><p>"Simple illusions" Akane said to herself.  She had faced those before.  The first image appeared before her,  slashing to the right.  Akane took a  step back, avoiding that one.  She felt  the wind from that one.  An illusion  would not do that.  Akane started to  worry.  The second form came to her,  slashing to the left.  Akane leapt back,  dodging that one.  The final form  charged her, slashing upwards at Akane.   Akane leapt into the air, her eyes were on the final "ghost".  Suddenly, she felt something.  She looked up.  Ukyo was there, bringing her spatula down to Akane's head.  Akane flipped in mid air, just avoiding that  blow.  Ukyo hit the ground hard with her  spatula, sending Akane flying into the ground with the wind that Ukyo had  created.  Akane landed hard on the  platform.  She got back up.  Her face was all dirty.  Ukyo looked to her, very satisfied.</p><p>"H…how in the world…" Akane said to her.</p><p>"Here…let me show you again!"  Ukyo said, thoroughly enjoying her moment.</p><p>Ukyo charged with her "Parting of the Heavens  attack" again.</p><p>"Mistake number one Ukyo!"  Akane said to herself.   Akane eyed closely the images.   They slashed in the same manner, sending her in the air at the final  swipe.  Akane looked up.  Ukyo was coming from the sky again.  She had her.  Akane grabbed the wide end of the spatula, falling to the ground.  She fell to her back, sending the spatula  and Ukyo over the platform and to the ground.   Akane flipped up, eager to see what happened.</p><p>Ukyo soared over the ground.  She spotted something.  A tree.   Ukyo thrust her spatula into the ground, flipping over it and landing on  the tree.  Expertly, she rebounded off  the tree, grabbing her spatula in the process and landing in the corner of the  platform. Akane knew she wouldn't win so easily.</p><p>Akane charged her, not giving her time to  recover.  Ukyo put up her defense.  Akane thought back to her training with  Cologne.  That spatula was a lot like  that staff she would carry around.  Ukyo  wasn't as experienced as Cologne, so her trick might just work.  Akane continued her attacks, purposely  leaving her guard down over her stomach.   Ukyo, noticing this, swiped at her.   Akane grabbed the spatula, letting it whirl her around to where she was  actually hanging off the platform.   Akane planted her feet on the edge, throwing herself backward and taking  Ukyo with her.   Or so she thought.</p><p>Ukyo just let go of the spatula, leaving Akane in a  very bad spot.  Her feet were touching  the platform and her hands were holding the spatula, which was dug into the  ground.  Her whole body was exposed and  vulnerable, sitting there in an arc.   Ukyo walked up to Akane, calmly.   She kicked her feet off the platform.   Akane brought her feet up, gripping the spatula close to her.  She was hanging upside down on the  handle.  Akane hung there a few seconds,  contemplating on what to do.  Ukyo threw  a mini spatula at her, landing right in front of the handle of the  spatula.  She was toying with her.  Akane moved her body a bit.  The spatula was sturdy enough.  Slowly she worked her hands up the spatula's  handle, it was wobbling, making it extremely difficult.  Akane took a deep breath,  concentrating.  Ukyo just looked  on.  That Akane was amazing sometimes.</p><p>Akane reached the business end of the spatula.  Her balance was perfect.  She brought her feet forward and swung them  back hard.  She released her grip of the  spatula, flipping in the air and landing on the wide end of the spatula.  The handle sank deeper into the ground,  proving more stability.  The crowd  cheered.  Akane stood a top the spatula,  smiling. There was no way to throw Ukyo out the ring…there must be another way.</p><p>Ranma was amazed.   "Man…that training has helped Akane focus a lot more than before."  Ranma kept watching, forgetting that he was  actually spying on Akane.  This was a  nice match.</p><p>Akane placed her hands together.  She closed her eyes.</p><p>Ukyo's eyes widened.  "Man…she <i>is</i> serious!   I never learned a counter to her Ki attack.  Wait…this is perfect."   Ukyo said.  She would risk the  match on this next move. Ukyo leapt to Akane with a flying kick.  Akane opened her eyes, catching the  foot.</p><p>"Gotcha!"   She said.  She whirled around,  sending Ukyo to the tree that Ranma was perched on. The same one that Ukyo had  rebounded off the first time.  Ukyo  rebounded a second time.  Akane was  ready. She leapt to Ukyo, catching her by the shoulders.  She drove Ukyo into the ground hard;  balancing herself on Ukyo's shoulder for just a second.  Akane too, soon fell to the ground, leaving  a small dust cloud.  The two got up,  looking at each other.  They smiled at  each other.  Soon those smiles turned  into laughter.  Akane was the winner.</p><p>The Master of the Seven Swords School presented  Akane with a small bag.  Inside was that  100,000 yen she had won, and rightfully so.</p><p>Ranma looked on.   Akane seemed to be just thrilled to win that money.  "She did all that just for that money?  So that's why she didn't want to go to the  movies."  Ranma was a bit hurt.  He followed Akane and Ukyo, who were fast  becoming best friends.</p><p>"Wow Akane, great job back there."  Ukyo said.   Nice special tackle attack.</p><p>Akane smiled.   "Thanks Ukyo.  The rules said  first to hit the ground would win so…"</p><p>"Well I guess I was first huh?"</p><p>"Well you almost had me with that "<i>Wakareji  Kyuuten</i>" attack.  How did you learn  that so fast?"</p><p>"To be honest I didn't learn it.'' Ukyo said,  unsheathing her spatula and indicating a small set of marks.  "This is similar to Martial Arts  Calligraphy.  Those marks bring out the  essence of the weapon, allowing me to sort of, "let go" of the weapon and let  it do it's own thing.  It's kinda  strange but its quite effective."</p><p>"You mean that the spatula takes on a mind of its  own?"</p><p>"Sorta…more like the Spatula feeds off my energy and  uses it for an attack."</p><p>"Oh…that's amazing…" Akane said.</p><p>"Yea…the Seven Swords School's techniques' include  animating their weapons and having them fight along side you.  Some involve very complex writings, while  others are Ki based.  That attack was  the very basic kind.  I have seen people  in there spar with their own weapons."</p><p>"Wow…that's pretty remarkable.  I think I'll ask Cologne about their  history.  I'll bet she knows all about  them."</p><p>"Yea you're prolly right on that one sugar.  Come on; let's go have an Okonomiyaki.  Free to the winner."  Ukyo said with a big smile.</p><p>"Oh…I'll have to take you up on that another time  Ukyo.  I have…something important to  do."</p><p>Ukyo thought for a moment.  "Oh…tomorrow is…"</p><p>Akane nodded happily.</p><p>"Well, see ya later then.  I'll stop by tomorrow."</p><p>With that the two friends parted ways.  Akane went inside the shop, buying the combo  for Ranma, and a few more things for her.   She hid Ranma's present in the dresses, shirts, and shorts she had  bought.</p><p>Ranma watched her exit the store.  Her arms were full of things.  "So…well I guess that was more important  that just goin' to the movies…so why do I fell kinda sad.  Maybe I was looking forward to it.  We really hadn't been on a real date, ever  since the fiancée business was sorted out."   Ranma walked the opposite direction as Akane.  He would return conspicuously late.  No one would suspect a thing.</p><p>*****Hey! It didn't take me a week to update! Pretty  kool, huh? Well, I gotta make this quick. I gotta be at work in 40 minutes and I  still have to eat and take a shower. My personal favorite part is the lingerie  part. That was fun to write!. The switch to towards the Second part of my fic,  that deals with the other characters. I won't spoil it. Oh, and by the way. The  Seven Swords School is © by me, Michael! That's me! Yea. This is the first  place I used it. But, it's found it's true home on my original story, which  will be sent to publication in the coming months. Not that I'm worried about  theft. I couldn't care less. I have the evidence on my comp that says when this  file was first created and even my notes in my portfolio. So whatever… But I just  learned how to put the little © thingy on my works and I was dying to give it a  try. It's really kool! © © ©. Hehehe!</p><p>And forgive any errors. I did a really fast job  running through this. Hope you like it! Not like it needed a lot of help  anyway. I believe this chapter was done about 8 months ago. And it's been  edited hundreds of times. Not to submission standards, mind you. That is  totally hard! Ugh…good rule of thumb for all those of you like me that are  writing. Second draft=first draft minus 10%. Live by it! It really works! But I  only cut out a few hundred on this. It's still pretty good I think. Until next  we meet!*****</p>
