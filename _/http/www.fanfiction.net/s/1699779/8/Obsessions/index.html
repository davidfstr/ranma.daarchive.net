</div><p>Chapter Eight</p><p><u>Fallen  Arches</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane entered the Dojo.  Kasumi had dinner set out.  Ranma looked at everyone and scratched his  head, nervously.</p><p>"Ah, welcome back Ranma.  Did you have a nice walk?"   Genma asked.</p><p>"Uh…yea pops, it was such a nice day out there…"</p><p>Genma just nodded.   Soun looked on happily.</p><p>Everyone sat down and enjoyed yet another perfect  dinner.</p><p>Kasumi took everyone's plate.  Ranma and Akane started up stairs.  She tapped Ranma on the shoulder.  "Hey Ranma…remember what you said to me a  few days ago? Just a few days before the duel?"</p><p>Ranma thought for a moment.  "Well…I said lotsa things…"</p><p>"Well, one of those things was an attempt at helping  me train.  I've decided to accept that  invitation, seeing as I don't have to hide my moves from you any more."</p><p>Ranma cringed at those words.  He <i>had</i> offered to help her.  She just wanted a spar is all.</p><p>"And no holding back Ranma.  I want to see how much I've improved."</p><p>"Fine Akane, you have a deal.  After school is when I teach you the essence  of the Anything Goes style."</p><p>Akane smiled, she had finally got her spar, a real  one now.  "I can't wait," she said  slyly.  She turned around and headed  into her room.</p><p>"Oh man…Well you owe it to her now…" Ranma said to  himself, getting ready for a bath.  "If  she wanted to learn some of my moves, all she woulda had to do was ask…maybe  she just didn't want to spoil it for me back at the duel.  That was impressive after all…"</p><p>The night wrapped up, just like every other  night.  Akane had finally got her spar.</p><p><u>Duel of  the Fates Redux</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane raced down the street, heading for  the school.  "Ranma…you over slept and  made us late <i>again</i>!"  Akane said,  a few steps in front of Ranma.</p><p>He caught up to her.  "Well, sorry!  Pops didn't  wake me up as he usually did, crashing around in our room."</p><p>"Well, if I didn't know better, I would say that you  didn't want to have our little spar after school.  Maybe your afraid I've learned so much I could actually win now."</p><p>Ranma scoffed, "Yea right, as if you could even lay  a finger on me."</p><p>Akane turned around and smiled at Ranma with her  cute smile.</p><p>Soon they reached the school.  Everything went as normal, if there ever was  a normal at the school.  Akane sat in  class, happily planning her moves.  This  was a big deal for her.  Ranma just sat  in class, bored.  Who needed all this  math and geography?  On second though,  there was someone that should have been in Geography class.</p><p>"I wonder what happened to Ryoga."  Ranma thought to himself.  "He would usually come back as that little  runt.  Oh…that's right.  Akane figured out who he was, back on that  day…" Ranma shuddered a bit, his mind still vividly recalled the blood stained  Akane, lying in his arms.  He shook his  head, throwing the pictures out.  "Ryoga  is prolly a hundred miles from here by now…either that or he's just coming into  town…either way he has no idea where he is…"</p><p>School finished up in its usual manner for  Ranma.  Dull and boring.  Ranma left his last class, heading  outside.  Akane was talking to Nabiki  outside.</p><p>"Well sis, I'll leave you two alone now.  Three's a crowd isn't it?"  Nabiki said with a smile, noticing Ranma  approaching.  Akane looked at her a bit  confused.</p><p>"I wonder what's up with her," Akane asked</p><p>"I dunno…" Ranma said, coming along side of her.</p><p>"Well Ranma, let's go home" Akane said,  smiling.  Ranma nodded, he had enough  school for one day.</p><p>"You know…I haven't seen Kuno in a while…" Ranma  said</p><p>"Yea…that is kind of weird of him.  He would have challenged you at least three  times by now."</p><p>"You don't suppose he's out looking for his "pig  tailed girl" do you?"</p><p>"I don't think so.   Usually he rotates between me and you…well the other you."</p><p>Ranma and Akane reached the Dojo.  Kasumi was doing a bit of cleaning and  Nabiki was nowhere to be found.  Soun  and Genma were playing a game of GO.   They both looked up and smiled at their heirs.</p><p>"So what have you been up to Akane?"  Soun asked.</p><p>"Oh, its nothing much really dad.  Ranma and I are about to have a spar."  Akane said, smiling.</p><p>"Oh, that is wonderful news, isn't it Saotome?"</p><p>"Yes, Tendou."   Genma said.  "Ranma, it is your  duty to teach Akane the essence of the Anything Goes Martial Arts style."</p><p>"Yea I know pops…I already told Akane I have no  intention of holding back."  Ranma said,  turning to Akane and smiling.</p><p>"Oh Ranma, such wonderful news.  You threw out your own beliefs for your own  father, that the Anything Goes style lives."</p><p>"Well actually, I kinda got tricked into it…" Ranma  said.</p><p>"Tricked?"   Soun asked, looking at Akane.</p><p>"Yea, dad, well Ranma had offered to train me before  the duel, so I decided to accept his offer.   There were no tricks involved."</p><p>"Well, you two take care now.  The fate of this Dojo rests with you…" Soun  said, returning to his game.</p><p>Akane turned to Ranma, smiling broadly.  "I'm gonna go get changed, meet you in the  training hall!"  With that Akane took  off up stairs.</p><p>Ranma went into the training hall, a bit  reluctantly.  "Well, if she wants a  match, I'll give her one."  Ranma got  himself prepared.</p><p>Akane entered the hall, holding something behind her  back.  She was smiling that smile of  hers again.  That smile made Ranma a bit  uneasy…</p><p>"Hey Akane, what'cha got back…" Ranma's words were  interrupted by a splash of cold water.   A towel followed the water.</p><p>"Ok Ranma, now I am ready!"  Akane said, taking her stance.</p><p>Female Ranma smiled.  "Well, I <i>hope</i> you are Akane.  You realize my strength may have gone down, but I'm a whole lot  faster like this.  I wont go easy on  you!"  Ranma took her stance</p><p>"Good, just the way I wanted it."  Akane said with a sly smile.</p><p>The two stared at each other for a few seconds.  Akane lead off first.  She leaped towards Ranma, throwing a volley  of punches.  Ranma leapt over her,  spinning around.  Akane's eye caught  sight of this and she threw a backward kick at Ranma.  Ranma, in mid air by now, lowered her hands, catching Akane's leg  and using the force to fly backwards, landing with a flip.  Akane charged Ranma, launching a high kick  to her face.  Ranma had a little trouble  keeping up.  She tilted her head to the  right, avoiding the blow.  Akane  followed up with her other leg, executing a sort of roundhouse.  Ranma ducked the kick, going for a sweep on  Akane.  Akane skillfully back flipped  away.  Ranma now took the offensive.  She ran to Akane, throwing a punch to  Akane's chest.  Akane caught the fist,  throwing her hands in the air and making Ranma's hand do the same.  Ranma attacked with her other fist.  Akane tilted her head to the right, ducking  slightly.  Her eyes narrowed, seeing an  opening.  She launched an uppercut to  the left side of Ranma's face.  Ranma  swiftly used her other hand to stop the blow, grabbing the fist.  Akane tried a kick to her midsection.  Ranma leaped back, the foot just grazing her  shirt.  She flipped backwards a few  times, landing a good distance away from Akane.</p><p>"Wow, Akane!   No wonder you won against Shampoo.   You've got a lot faster."</p><p>"Well you haven't seen anything yet Ranma."  Akane said with a bit of a smile.    She charged Ranma, launching a right.  Ranma bent backwards, avoiding it.  Akane tried a sweep attack.  Ranma flipped backwards again.  This time, Ranma charged Akane, throwing a  right of her own.  Akane saw another  opening.  She ducked down a bit, placing  her forearm over her head.  She grabbed  Ranma's hand, pulling it over her.  She  placed a hand on Ranma's stomach, grabbing her shirt.  She then fell to the ground backwards, sending Ranma flying over  her.  Ranma did an aerial somersault,  landing gracefully.</p><p>Akane ran towards Ranma, throwing her famous  right.  Ranma grabbed her by the wrist  and using her own energy against her, flung Akane's back into the wall with a  quick spin.  She placed a forearm to Akane's  throat.</p><p>"Haha, gotcha!"</p><p>Akane struggled against Female Ranma's strength.  "I…I don't think so!"  Akane said, trying to knee Ranma in the  stomach.  Ranma let loose her grip on  Akane's hand and stopped the Knee.  Now  Akane had both hands free.  She placed  them on Ranma's shoulders and fell to the ground.  She used Ranma's shoulders as a kind of swing, going through her  legs and kicking Ranma in the back of the head.  Ranma's head hit the wall kind of hard.  She whirled around, noticing a very pleased looking Akane.  Ranma offered a sly smile of her own and  went back to the offensive.</p><p>"Ok Akane…time to show him what you have  learned!'  Akane smiled to herself as  she widened her stance and placed her fists to her side.</p><p><i>"Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken</i>!"</p><p>Ranma was not surprised to see his attack being  used.  Skillfully, she singled out all  of Akane's blows, blocking them with relative ease.  Ranma launched her own "<i>Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken</i>" Akane  struggled to keep up with her fists, but they moved so fast as to blend into  just a single blur.  Ranma struck Akane  in the chest with a fist, sending her down to the ground.  Akane sat on the ground, holding her  wound.  It was almost healed but still  didn't like to be hit.</p><p>"Time to get serious" Akane said, jumping to her  feet.  She placed her palms together and  closed her eyes.  Ranma got a worried  look on her face.  Akane opened her  palms, revealing a familiar blue flame, dancing and floating in the air.</p><p>"W…Wait just a sec Akane!  We are still inside…there's no need too…"</p><p>"<i>Tenrai Ryuujin no</i>…"</p><p>Ranma threw up her arms.  This was gonna hurt.   After a second, Ranma looked up, seeing a smiling Akane in her  face.  She lifted a finger, hitting  Ranma on the nose.</p><p>"Gotcha!'   Akane said</p><p>Ranma fell to the ground, stunned, but  relieved.  Akane followed suit.</p><p>Ranma tried to calm down her pulse.  She noticed that Akane was a bit winded.</p><p>"What's wrong Akane?"</p><p>"I…don't know…it's like whenever I try to…use the  attack I get…a bit winded."</p><p>Ranma smiled at her   "You just don't have full control over it yet.  If you woulda asked me I coulda helped you out a bit…"</p><p>Akane smiled back at Ranma.  "I know you could have helped, but, what's  done is done."</p><p>"Well I'll teach you later, I'm kinda wore out"</p><p>"Yea me too.   Finally I got you to be serious for once…well <i>almost</i> serious"</p><p>Ranma smiled.   Akane did figure out that Ranma held back…just a little.</p><p>The training hall door slid open.  Ranma and Akane turned to the noise,  noticing two familiar figures standing there.</p><p>Ranma and Akane's eyes widened.  They jumped to their feet.</p><p>"<i>Nihao</i> Ranma!"  Shampoo said in her usually cheerful tone.</p><p>"Sh- Shampoo…what are you doin' here?"  Ranma asked, a bit nervous.</p><p>"Oh, Kasumi told us you two training.  We not interrupt anything?"</p><p>"Uh…no…its just kinda unexpected…."</p><p>Shampoo approached Ranma, smiling as she drew near.  Akane watched, standing next to him.  Her confused look turned into one of anger  when Shampoo grabbed Ranma's head and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek.  Shampoo backed up, smiling.</p><p>Akane raised her hand, aiming it towards Ranma, who  looked on, innocently.</p><p>"Is no worries Ranma and Akane.  Is Amazon tradition."</p><p>"Great, another tradition." Akane said, lowering her  hand.  She convinced herself to listen  to Shampoo…Just this once.</p><p>"Son in…I mean Ranma.  Do not be angry.  As the  kiss of death binds an Amazon to an opponent, so does the kiss of life release  them."  Cologne said, approaching.</p><p>"Kiss of <i>life</i>?"  Ranma and Akane asked, together.</p><p>"Yes, it is a tradition that spans 3000 years of  Chinese Amazon history.  The kiss of  life recognizes what fate had in store for a person.  The fact that Shampoo lost indicates that the fates had not  chosen her to be Ranma's wife.   According to our traditions a husband should have the strongest wife and  vice versa.  Shampoo is no longer a  threat to you two."</p><p>Ranma and Akane looked at Cologne, dumbfounded.</p><p>After a few moments Ranma spoke up.</p><p>"So what'cha doin' back here?"  He asked</p><p>"Well, Ranma," Cologne started.  "I thought I had guaranteed Shampoo's  victory by teaching her the "<i>Shinzenbi Neko Ken</i>.  While not as strong as the involuntary "<i>Neko  Ken</i>," the true cat fist grants lightning fast reflexes instantly, while  keeping a small amount of humanity.   Upon recollection on what happened, Akane seems to have vastly improved  her skills.  I had no idea she could  master a Ki technique as fast as you or Ryoga.   We may have underestimated her tenacity."</p><p>Akane smiled, blushing a bit.  Cologne continued.</p><p>"Well, to answer your question, I must see the power  that ultimately lead to Shampoo's defeat."</p><p>Akane nodded, smiling.  "Sure" She said, placing her hands together.</p><p>Cologne stopped her.  "No, not here.  We shall  go to a more deserted place."</p><p>"I know just the place, follow me."  Akane said, leading the group out.</p><p>They ended up in the vacant lot Akane had used to  gain her techniques.</p><p>"Ok Akane," Cologne said, heading to the opposite  side of the field.  "Try to hit me with  your technique."</p><p>Akane nodded, placing her hands together.  She knew that Cologne had some sort of way  to avoid her attack.</p><p>"<i>Tenrai Ryuujin no Hitoare</i>!"</p><p>Akane shot the blue flame out, bursting towards  Cologne.  Cologne eyed the flame coming  towards her, getting a sense of what it was all about.  She held up her staff, spinning it around in  a circle, extinguishing the flames before they hit.  Ranma and Shampoo looked on amazed again.  Akane fell to her knees, breathing hard.</p><p>Cologne hopped up to her.  "Very good Akane…I see why that did as much damage as it did to  Shampoo.  You must have been very  angry."</p><p>Akane looked up, sweat forming on her forehead.  "Yea…" she said simply.</p><p>"It is a powerful attack, but very crude."</p><p>Akane stood up, listening along with Ranma and  Shampoo.  "To achieve the most power  from your attack, you must polish it and shape it, as a diamond needs to be  polished and shaped.  Still, it is  impressive that you managed to pull the attack off without fainting.  Being any less of a martial artist would  have resulted in me keeping a son-in-law."</p><p>Ranma and Akane smiled.</p><p>Cologne continued.   "Where did you learn those techniques?"</p><p>"Well, I found this strange tome outside my  window…it was gift wrapped and even had a bow on it.  I saw pictures of various moves and decided that I should try  them."</p><p>"May I see this book?"</p><p>"Sure" Akane said, recovering her breath and taking  them back to the Dojo.  Akane went to  her room and returned with the book.</p><p>Cologne flipped through a few pages, an indifferent  look on her face.</p><p>"I see…" she said after a few minutes.  "Whoever left this tome at your window  surely wanted you to win the duel.  This  is a very ancient tome, dating from 3000 years ago.  It is the culmination of the sacred rules and martial arts  techniques that the Amazons used back then.   I remember studying from the book when I was your age Akane.  It is how I became so skillful.  Unfortunately, the monastery that guarded  this "Tome of the Ancients" burned down about 100 years ago.  I assumed the book with it.  Clearly, the fates were in your favor  Akane."</p><p>Akane looked at Cologne, confused. All this talk  about fate…</p><p>"Well Akane, your techniques, although impressive,  need refinement.  I will train you on  proper control, as I have trained Ranma."</p><p>Akane smiled.   "Really? Thanks!"</p><p>Kasumi entered the hall.  "Ranma, Akane, dinner is…Oh my! Visitors!" Kasumi said, smiling  happily.  "Well, if it isn't Cologne and  Shampoo.  It is so nice to see you two  doing well.  Please, stay with us for  dinner, it's the least we can do.  I  made plenty for everyone."</p><p>"You are too kind Kasumi" Cologne said.  Everyone followed Kasumi to the table.  Soun and Genma were a bit shocked to see  Shampoo back in their house, but she was a guest here.</p><p>Kasumi served dinner.  Cologne offered an explanation.</p><p>"I apologize for putting your family through this,  everyone.  Amazon traditions can be that  way, but it is our sacred duty to uphold them.   As a token of our appreciation for your forgiveness, I have offered to  train Akane in the way of martial arts, the same way I did Ranma."</p><p>Akane and Ranma smiled.  Soun and Genma were pleased.</p><p>"Certainly this is good news, huh Tendou?"  Genma asked</p><p>"It certainly is.   With Cologne's knowledge of martial arts and Ranma and Akane's skill,  the dojo will surely last far beyond any of us at this table today."  Soun said, tears of happiness stinging his  eyes.</p><p>Everyone sat and talked to each other.  Most everything was forgiven.  Dinner was finished in an up beat manner and  Cologne and Shampoo said their good byes.   They would be back tomorrow after school.  Akane would begin her training immediately after.  It would be hard, but if that idiot Ranma  went though it, Akane could sure learn a point or two.</p><p>Ranma and Akane walked down the street the next  morning, heading for yet another day of boredom, at least according to  Ranma.  Akane really didn't love school,  it was more a place just to go and visit with friends.  She did try her best at school, something  that should have rubbed off on Ranma.</p><p>They entered the courtyard, not shocked to see Kuno  standing in their way.  Ranma rolled his  eyes while Akane got this "you have got to be kidding" look in her face.</p><p>"Alas…what an unspeakable evil I am forced to bear  witness to.  The beautiful Akane  Tendou…deceived by the incorrigible Ranma Saotome.  What tricks must you use on one so beautiful Ranma?"</p><p>"Kuno, this is gettin'…"</p><p>"Silence Ranma Saotome!  Your pleas of mercy have fallen upon a heart of stone.  However, this stone cold heart has a side of  velvet, one for with to comfort Akane Tendou."   Kuno said, throwing something towards her.</p><p>Akane quickly threw out her hand, snagging the gift  in mid flight.  A bouquet of red roses…</p><p>"Akane Tendou.   There is room in this velvet-covered heart for both you and my pig  tailed goddess.  I love you!"  Kuno said, running up to her.</p><p>Akane narrowed her eyes, sidestepping the attempted  hug.  He charged again, this time  finding Akane's foot stuck to his face.   Kuno reeled back a few steps.  He  had cut his lip.</p><p>"Kuno, get over yourself" Ranma said, his hands  behind his head.  "You are never gonna  win Akane or your pigtailed girl.  Just  give it up…"</p><p>"I can never give up on either of my true  loves.  With my sword by my side, I  shall smite all that dares to cross my path towards what the heavens have fated  me.  For many months, I have pursued  them, in hopes that they could finally admit the feelings they had for me.  Ranma!   You have corrupted Akane, brainwashing her into believing that you are  her true fiancée, when in fact, it is I, Kuno Tatewaki, the Blue Thunder of  Furinkan High.  Oh…how loathsome it is  for me to even mention your name.  The  will of heaven acts through my blade, for I shall cut thee down once and—" Kuno  paused a second, looking around.  Ranma  and Akane had just left…Curses!</p><p>"Man…nothing short of an actual wedding is gonna  stop that guy." Ranma said, walking inside the school hallways to Akane</p><p>"Yea…I'm kinda starting to worry about him.  He is very persistent, if he ever does  focuses in on ruining our lives, he could prove to be more bothersome than you  could handle."</p><p>Ranma scoffed.   "Yea right, that Kuno doesn't have the brains to anything to us.  All he knows is getting hurt."</p><p>"Well Ranma, don't forget about Kodachi, the Black  Rose.  She can be very tricky."</p><p>"Nah, she's powerless to do anything to us.  All I have to do is avoid her cooking and we  should be fine."  Ranma said,  smiling.</p><p>Akane returned his smile.  "Yea…I guess you're right.   It sure is nice not having to deal with anyone trying to break us up."</p><p>"You're tellin' me…I don't get hit as much like  this."  Ranma said, nervously  smiling.  Akane looked at him.  She knew exactly what he meant.</p><p>They entered their fist class, and soon were  engrossed in lesson plans and chalk.</p><p>Soon it was time to go home. Ranma was a bit tired,  having been bored to death.  Akane  eagerly awaited lessons from Cologne.</p><p>"I wonder if that was another one of their  laws?"  Akane thought to herself, Ranma  walking next to her. "It is a bit strange…at first they were my enemy…so to  speak.  Now its like two new people  showed up at our door."  Akane smiled to  herself.  "Get ready Ranma, I'll make  sure you have to use your best against me.   Who knows...maybe I can actually win a match."</p><p>"Hey Akane, what'cha smilin' about?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh…I was just thinking how great it's going to be,  getting training from Cologne."</p><p>"Well, she's pretty strict.  She will accept nothing short of your best."</p><p>"Good…that's the way I want it."</p><p>Ranma and Akane arrived at the Dojo.  Ranma went to grab a quick snack while Akane  went upstairs, changing into her Gi.   Soun and Genma smiled at each other.   Things were going their way for once in a long while.  A knock came from the door.</p><p>"Oh…I'll get it."   Kasumi said, opening the door.   "Oh, Miss Cologne and Miss Shampoo.   What a pleasant surprise!   Please, come in!"   Cologne and  Shampoo entered, offering their thanks.</p><p>"Ok I'm ready!"   Akane said with a smile.</p><p>"Good."   Cologne said simply.  The group  parted the Dojo, heading for the vacant lot.   That was the perfect place to begin training.</p><p>Akane stood on the far side of the lot.  A warm wind was blowing, taking Akane's hair  gently with it.  Cologne stood on the  opposite side.  She seemed to be staring  into Akane's heart, trying to get a feel for her motivations.  Ranma and Shampoo sat under the lone  tree.  That provided enough shade for  both of them.</p><p>"Ok Akane, come at me with all you have.  I shall assess what areas you need to  develop."</p><p>Akane focused in on her.  So wise…and strong…she would definitely try to give Cologne a run  for her money.  She took her stance,  waiting patiently for the right time to strike.  There were no openings on Cologne's part.  Akane rushed in…</p><p>Ranma and Shampoo watched the spar.  Cologne easily dodged Akane's attacks, while  Akane took a few hits from her staff, revealing places her guard was down.</p><p>Ranma turned to Shampoo.  She sat next to him, watching the fight carefully.</p><p>Ranma started to get a bit uneasy.  "Man…this is weird…having Shampoo this close  to me and her not all over me by now.   Those Amazon traditions are somethin' else…"</p><p>"What wrong Ranma…you look not good." Shampoo  asked.  "Is no worries Ranma, Shampoo  not threat any more."</p><p>Ranma smiled, nervously.  "Oh…so there's no hard feelings or anything?"</p><p>"Is no hard feelings Ranma.  Akane won duel fairly.  Shampoo did her best…but wasn't good  enough…" Shampoo looked down to the ground, sadly.</p><p>"Did she really love me?"  Ranma asked himself, seeing the sad look replacing Shampoo's  usually cheerful tone. "She must have given that fight her all for me…"</p><p>"Hey…Shampoo…" Ranma tried</p><p>Shampoo recovered quickly.  "Oh, no worries Ranma.   Shampoo find another husband back home in China."</p><p>"Well why not that Mousse fellow?  He seems to like you enough."</p><p>Shampoo turned her head in disgust.  "Shampoo can never love Mousse.  Would be breaking Amazon traditions."</p><p>Ranma thought for a moment.  "Well…didn't you break traditions by not  killing me?"</p><p>Shampoo turned to Ranma, stunned.  She turned her head down to the ground.  Ranma was right.  It wouldn't be the first time she broke the rules.  But breaking them was unforgivable…</p><p>Ranma noticed that Shampoo was deep in thought about  the words he said.  He decided to let  her decide on her own, going back to the match.  Shampoo resumed her watching after a few moments.</p><p>Akane dashed in towards Cologne, who was perched on  her staff.  Akane threw a series of  punches.  Cologne dodged them, leaning  her staff to avoid them.  Akane tried a  high kick to Cologne's head.  Cologne  hopped off her staff, bringing it up and striking Akane in the stomach.  That small blow sent Akane flying backwards,  landing on her backside.  Cologne appeared  before her, again perched on her staff.   Akane stared at her.  She quickly  got up, going on the attack again.  She  tried another kick.  Cologne leapt into  the air, avoiding the blow.  Akane leapt  after her.  The two converged in the  air, seeming to strike out at each other at the same time.  Cologne landed, whirling around to  Akane.  Akane landed on her knees,  holding her side.  She got up, gritting  her teeth. That was a hard blow.  She  turned to Cologne.</p><p>"Akane.   Don't expect me to hold back on you just because you are a girl.  I trained Shampoo, Ranma, and Ryoga in this  same manner."</p><p>Akane just stood there, wincing.  "Man…her defense is perfect…there are no  openings.  She seems to be able to read  all my moves."</p><p>"Akane, you require a bit more training before you  can master your attacks.  Shall we call  it a day?"</p><p>Akane stood straight up, her side still hurt.  "Yea…lets call it a day."  Akane said.   She looked into the sky.  Dinner  was going to be ready soon.</p><p><u>The Plan…</u></p><p>"<i>What</i>!"   Kodachi exclaimed.  "You will do  no such thing to my Ranma-sama!"  She  yelled, drawing her deadly ribbon.</p><p>Kuno drew his sword.  "Ranma has befouled the lovely Akane Tendou and my pigtailed  girl.  He must pay!  Even if it means bringing an end to my  twisted sister's reign!"</p><p>Kodachi laughed in her usual way, making Kuno cringe  a bit.  "You have no hope of defeating  my Ranma-sama!"</p><p>Kuno smiled.   "This time I shall surely bring a swift end to him.  I know all his tricks.  He cannot escape!"  Kuno finished and slashed at Kodachi.  Kodachi threw out her ribbon, snagging Kuno's sword and bringing  it to her.</p><p>"Dear brother.   Just leave Ranma-sama to me.  I  have devised a plan that shall bring him to me, begging for my hand.  In which case you would be free to have  Akane Tendou and your pigtailed girl."</p><p>Kuno looked at his sister suspiciously.  "What do you propose to do?"</p><p>Kodachi told him her plan.  Kuno smiled broadly.  He  returned to his normal state of being, having forgot himself that second.</p><p>"While this does not bring an end to Ranma, it would  surely free Akane Tendou and my pigtailed girl from his grasp, once he admits  to you his true feelings.  Then I shall  commence to dating them both!"</p><p>Kodachi smiled, putting on her apron.  There was some baking to do.</p><p><u>Unknowingly…</u></p><p>Ranma and Akane started back to the Dojo.  Akane was tired but seemed in high spirits.</p><p>"Hey Akane…I know what its like trying to best  Cologne.  I don't think she could ever  lose a match unless the wanted to on purpose."</p><p>"Yea Ranma…I see why you go so much better after  training with her.  Keeping up with her  moves is a feat in itself."</p><p>"300 years of martial arts training…but you have the  book she used to train with don't you?"</p><p>"Yea…I think she said something to that effect.  Think she wants it back?"</p><p>Ranma continued on his train of thought.  "No wonder you got so good.  If that book couldn't teach you some skills  then nothing could…"</p><p>Akane eyed him fiercely.  Ranma backed up, holding his hands up.  "Ju…just kidding Akane."   Ranma tried.</p><p>Akane turned her back to him.  "Well I'll show you Ranma.  I'll be a match for you one day.  Then you will have to take me seriously."</p><p>Ranma  smiled at Akane.  Good luck…</p><p>*****Well,  things are finally starting to pick back up. The next couple of chapters are  some of my favorite ones. But I think I'm gonna go back a rewrite them just a  bit. Why? Why not? Hope you liked this chapter here. Was this a cliffhanger? I guess  it was…</p><p>And  just wanted to say I finished <u>Grateful Days</u>. My fourth fanfiction. Yay!  It didn't need that much focus, just a scene added and a brief dialogue. And  then, it was all good from there until the end. By the time I've finished  posting <u>Obsessions</u> and <u>Just Give Me One More Chance</u>, <u>Grateful  Days</u> should be ready, just in case anyone out there is waiting for them or  whatever. I could try to post them two stories at a time…but maybe later. I just  found a writing contest. Several in fact that I'm gonna enter. One in  particular I'm going to enter my first fully original story Peerless. Heh, quite  frankly, I can't lose! Thanks to all you guys (and gals too) that posted  reviews. It's helped me a lot! But now, I'm off. I have 15 days to make the  story perfect. Actually, it's only certain chapters. It's a kinda strange  contest where you submit chapters of your unpublished novels. And they judge  them some how…whatever. Just as long as I can enter!</p><p>Until  next we meet!*****</p>
