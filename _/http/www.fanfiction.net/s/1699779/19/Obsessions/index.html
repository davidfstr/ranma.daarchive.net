</div><p>Chapter  Nineteen</p><p><u>Hearts of  Love, Hearts of Hate</u></p><p>Ranma remained with his eyes clenched tight.  He knew this was going to happen. He knew  it… He just listened…everyone was in silence.   He couldn't stand it any longer; he <i>had</i> to see what his fiancée's  fate was.</p><p>Ranma turned, opening his eyes and forcing them down  upon Akane.  All he could do was stare…<i>something</i>  had happened…or had it?</p><p>"Ran-Chan?"   Ukyo asked, slowly.  She looked  over to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma looked over to Ukyo, utterly perplexed.  He returned his gaze to Akane.  She was still human…just a bit wet.  A large weight was lifted off his chest.</p><p>Akane started coughing up water violently.  Ranma smiled.  She was alive and breathing.   He went over to her, holding her wet body in his arms.</p><p>"Akane…Thank God you're alright."  Ranma sighed.  He looked around.  There  had to be an explanation.</p><p>"You got me Ran-Chan."  Ukyo said, noticing the look of confusion on Ranma's face.  Ryoga just shrugged.</p><p>"Maybe an empty spring?"  Mousse offered.</p><p>"No Mousse…Great-grandmother say empty spring on the  North side.  This west side." Shampoo  returned</p><p>Ranma just smiled.   Somehow, he had got extremely lucky. He looked to the sky, thanking  whatever had saved his fiancée.  A few  clouds were starting to gather. He turned his eyes back to Akane, watching her  open her eyes.</p><p>"Hey…you awake in there?  It's me, Ranma."  He said  softly.</p><p>"Ra…Ranma…?"   Akane started.  Everything was  blurry.  She focused in on Ranma…that  name…that name got to her in a way she could not explain…</p><p>Ranma felt Akane's body tense up.</p><p>"Ranma…get the <i>hell</i> off of me…" Akane said  coldly.  Ranma was stunned.</p><p>"A…Akane…what's wrong?"  Ranma tried.</p><p>"Ranma…I said…<i>get the hell off of me</i>.  Are you stupid, deaf, or <i>both</i>?"  Akane demanded, sitting up in his lap.</p><p>Ranma widened his eyes, releasing Akane and backing  away slowly.</p><p>"W…wait a sec Akane…it's not my fault what  happened.''  Ranma started.  Akane was just staring at him, her eyes  almost piercing his soul.  He had done  it again…but what had he done to get Akane this angry?  It was like she was burning.</p><p>"Yea Akane…give poor Ran-Chan a break huh?"  Ukyo said.</p><p>Akane took in a deep breath.  She looked at everyone around her.  Shampoo was standing behind Mousse, looking  on worriedly.  Ukyo and Ranma were just  stunned.  Ryoga was standing next to  Ranma, in no better shape.  Akane closed  her eyes, clenching her fists.</p><p>"Oh man…she is pissed…" Ranma said, standing his  ground.  He owed it to her to remain to  where they could talk things out.</p><p>"Ok…I'm sorry Akane…There, I said it.  I'm sorry.   It was <i>my</i> fault, whatever it was.  Please Akane, try to understand…I really don't have any idea what  is goin' on right now."<br/>Akane opened her eyes and  smiled a bit.  Ranma relaxed.  So that was what love could do.</p><p>"See Akane…Ran-Chan is sorry.  We all are.   Why not go over there and give him a big…" Ukyo started.  She approached Akane, placing a hand on her  shoulder.  Ukyo quickly found herself on  the receiving end of a sharp fist to her face, knocking her down.  Everyone was at a loss.</p><p>"Don't  touch me bitch…" Akane said, smiling down to her victim.  She almost enjoyed that.<br/>"<i>Akane</i>…what the…<i>what's the hell is wrong with you</i>!"  Ranma yelled.</p><p>Akane just stood there, eyeing Ranma.</p><p>Ukyo just looked up, wiping the blood form her nose.  "I…I'm sorry Akane…" Ukyo returned  sadly.  A tear rolled down her  face.  Her friend had stuck out against  her, unjustly.  That was a worse blow  than that fist.</p><p>Ranma eyed Akane angrily.  "Hey Akane…if you got a problem with Uc-Chan, why not take it up  with me?"  He demanded</p><p>"I thought you would never ask Ranma."  Akane said, launching a fist to his  stomach.  The speed caught Ranma off  guard.  Akane quickly threw him to the  ground with a kick to the face.</p><p>Ranma just lie there, looking up at Akane.  She was walking around him, smiling.</p><p>"So Ranma…I have <i>so</i> far to go don't I?"  Akane asked, mockingly.  "Looks like you were the one that got  planted in the ground."</p><p>"Come on Akane…I know you have a temper, but this is  just crossin' the line.  You didn't have  ta' hit Uc-Chan like that."</p><p>"What can I say…she bothered me…" Akane said,  smiling at Ukyo.</p><p>"Akane…somethin' is really…" A voice cut off Ranma.</p><p>"Oh…kind sirs, what happen here?"  Said the Guide, running up and examining the  situation.</p><p>"Akane fell into that spring but she didn't change  at all…" Ryoga started.  On second  though she did change…</p><p>The little guide gasped.  "Oh, Kind sirs must leave now!"   He exclaimed, running off.</p><p>"What…what happened?"  Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh…is horrible fate that befall young girl.  Here in Jusenkyo, is legend of girl who  possessed by Oni, drown in spring 300 year ago.  Now whoever fall in become possessed by malevolent Oni spirit.  Is horrible…" The guide said.  Suddenly a rock hit him square in the side  of the head, knocking him out.</p><p>"Spring of Drown Oni…what the heck kinda spring is  that?  Geeze…of all the springs to fall  in."</p><p>He turned to Akane, whom was very satiated.  "Bah…how stupid…" She said, turning her gaze  from the guide back to Ranma.  "Ready to  finish?"</p><p>"Huh…finish what?"   Ranma asked,</p><p>"We have a duel to finish Ranma."  Akane said, cracking her knuckles.</p><p>"Please…that fight is over…besides, revenge is so  not like you."  Ranma returned</p><p>"<i>Ranma</i>…you are such an <i>idiot</i>!"  Akane shot back.  "This is <i>way</i> more than that!  All my life you have always won, no matter what we did.  Well now it's payback time.  I will defeat you, here and now!"</p><p>"Wait a sec Akane…I don't wanna fight you.  First we gotta figure out somethin' to help  you.  That guide said you were possessed  with an Oni."</p><p>"No Ranma…first I will defeat you, then…maybe I'll  get revenge on a few other people…"</p><p>Ranma looked on, something was definitely off with  Akane.  Akane looked at everyone  around.  She turned her gaze to Ukyo,  sitting on the ground with a bloody nose.   She turned back to Ranma.</p><p>"Oh…I know what you are thinking.  I guess I did kinda lose my temper back  then.  I guess I should apologize to  Ukyo first."</p><p>Ranma eyed Akane suspiciously.  That sounded like her, but the stuff before  did not.</p><p>Akane approached Ukyo.  She knelt down, smiling at her.   Something was off with her smile though.</p><p>"Sorry Ukyo…I guess I went a little overboard.  Hitting you wasn't the right thing to do."<br/>Ukyo smiled.  "It's ok I guess  Akane.  Now…we have to figure a way to  make you change back.  I didn't even see  that fist…"</p><p>Akane cut Ukyo off, grabbing her by the shirt and  lifting her up.  Ukyo struggled against  Akane's iron grip.</p><p>"Yea…sorry Ukyo…hitting you wasn't the right thing  to do.  Throwing you into a cursed  spring <i>is</i> though."</p><p>"<i>Akane</i>!   <i>What the hell are you doin'</i>!"   Ranma demanded.</p><p>"Finish our duel…or I'll throw <i>your</i> friend  into that spring over there.  Who knows  what she would turn into?"</p><p>"Akane…she is your friend too!"  Ranma said, approaching her.</p><p>Ukyo placed her hands on Akane's trying to free  herself.  Suddenly, Shampoo burst in,  shoving Akane out of the way.  Ukyo fell  to the ground, landing inches from the spring.</p><p>"You leave Ukyo out of this!"  Shampoo said.  "If you want fight I give to you!"</p><p>Akane eyed the Amazon fiercely.  Shampoo returned her fiery gaze.</p><p>"Rest assured Shampoo, you'll get your chance.  But first, I want to fight Ranma…"</p><p>Ranma just  looked on.  "Man…this is serious.  Akane has totally lost it."</p><p>He thought to himself for a few moments.  Before she fell in, Akane said not to worry…</p><p>"Wait a second!"   Ranma exclaimed to himself.  "The  "spring of drown girl" If we could just splash her with that water, that would  be the end of all this."</p><p>Ranma looked over to Mousse and Ryoga.  They both had the same idea and were running  to the "Spring of drown girl."</p><p>Ranma smiled.   All he had to do was lure Akane over to where they were.  If it was one thing Ranma could do it was  goad Akane into becoming enraged.</p><p>"Oh, I know what's goin' on here.  You're still upset that I keep beatin' you  huh?  Well, sorry, but it's not my fault  you lacked the class to get trained properly."</p><p>"Ranma…just shut up!  I'll beat you, once and for all!"</p><p>"I'd like  to see an un-cute tomboy try that." He shot back, smiling confidently.</p><p>"Fine Ranma!"   Akane shouted, charging at him.   She launched a right at Ranma's head.   Ranma smiled.  He could still  read her moves.  He moved his head  slightly, avoiding the blow.  Suddenly,  a sharp force hit him from behind.  Akane  had whirled around, connecting with the back of his head.  He stumbled forward, recovering  quickly.  He spun around, seeing Akane  on the attack again.  He leapt over her  kick, soon finding another kick heading straight towards him.  Akane's speed was incredible in her  transformed state.  Ranma placed his  hands on the foot, spring off them and landing on a nearby bamboo pole.  Akane jumped up, lashing out.  Ranma jumped backwards to another pole.</p><p>"Stand and fight me you <i>pervert</i>!"  Akane demanded angrily.  Ranma jumped back again, leading Akane  towards where Ryoga and Mousse were.   They looked into his eyes.  They  were ready.</p><p>"Catch me if you can, slowpoke!"  Ranma shouted, leaping down and heading  towards the spring.  Akane quickly  followed him.</p><p>"Ok guys now!"   Ranma shouted.  Ryoga and Mousse  loaded their buckets and launched them to Akane, whom had landed on the ground  seconds before.  She smiled; kicking the  buckets away and watching them land harmlessly on the ground.</p><p>"Oh….come on now…you didn't really think I would  fall for that?"  Akane asked.</p><p>"No…but you fell for <i>this</i>!"  Ranma said, above her in the air.  He launched the water down to Akane.  Akane back flipped out of the way, just in  time.  She turned around, looking at  Ranma.</p><p>"Damn…it didn't work!"  Ryoga said to Mousse.</p><p>Mousse looked around, spying Ryoga's umbrella.  "I have an idea Ryoga.  Get your umbrella.  If Akane can't move, she can't dodge the water."</p><p>Suddenly, Akane felt a twinge behind her.  She whirled, catching Ryoga's bamboo umbrella.  She felt something cold against her  legs.  It was a spiked chain Mousse had  launched.  The wide umbrella had hid it.  Now she was unable to move.  Mousse jerked the chains, sending Akane to  the ground.</p><p>Ranma approached her, carrying a bucket of water.  "Ok Akane…you're not yourself now.  Just calm down.  I'll splash you with this and you'll be fine."</p><p>"No Ranma…This isn't over yet!"  Akane yelled.  She grabbed the chains with her hand, yanking Mousse up to  her.  She planted a solid fist in  Mousse's stomach, sending him back a few feet.   She quickly undid the chains that bound her.  Ranma ran up to her, brandishing the water.</p><p>"Not so fast pervert!"  Akane yelled, rolling and picking up the spiked chain.  She threw it forcefully, striking the  bucket.  The water quickly leaked out.</p><p>"Damn!"   Ranma cursed.  "Akane sure is a  lot stronger in this form…" he said.</p><p>Akane turned back to Ranma.  Mousse got up slowly, standing next to him.</p><p>"Saotome…your fiancée is a bit troublesome."  Mousse started in a whisper.</p><p>"Yea…no kiddin', any ideas?"</p><p>"I will distract her.  You go after the water."   Mousse said, staring at Akane.</p><p>Ranma nodded.   He made the mistake of looking at Ryoga, standing ready with another  dose of water.</p><p>Mousse leaped into the air, launching a torrent of  daggers.  Akane caught a few, sending  the rest spinning away.</p><p>"Akane Tendou!   I challenge you!"  Mousse said  loudly.  He charged her, shooting a  series of punches and kicks to Akane.   Akane was backing up, dodging all of them.  She found an opening.  She  nailed Mousse in the jaw with a firm kick, making him reel back.  She then attacked with a sweep, sending  Mousse tumbling to the ground.  A kick  in the ribs ended any further protest from him.</p><p>Suddenly, Akane whirled around; launching the daggers  she had caught.</p><p>"Think I forgot about you Ryoga?" she asked  confidently.</p><p>Ryoga was stunned.   That attack was too fast.  He  dropped the bucket, trying to defend against that attack.  The daggers found their mark in Ryoga's  body.  One sank deeply into his right  leg.  The other two landed squarely in  his left shoulder and arm, the force of the throw making them plunge deeply  into his skin.  Ryoga felt a grinding as  the metal blades hit his bones, becoming stuck in them.  He was launched backwards, hitting a near by  stone.  He slumped over in pain,  everyone watching what was happening.</p><p>Shampoo looked across Jusenkyo, helping Ukyo  up.  She watched as her future husband  tried in vain to splash Akane with the cursed water.  She watched as he crashed into the ground violently.  They were both stunned at the sudden turn in  their friend.  Two of the guys were  defeated.  Suddenly Ryoga screamed out  in pain as the daggers dug themselves into his skin.</p><p>"Ryoga!"   Ukyo yelled, worried.  She looked  at Shampoo, whom was already looking at her.   They nodded to each other.  The  two shot off, putting themselves in the middle of the battle.</p><p>Ranma was speechless, looking at his wife, standing  there with that smile.  She almost  enjoyed causing pain to everyone.</p><p>" It's that curse" Ranma assured himself. "Hey  Ryoga…you gonna be ok?"</p><p>"Don't worry Ranma…I've gotten worse from you.  Watch out though, Akane's guard may be  higher than yours."</p><p>Ranma nodded, facing Akane.  That makes two down…</p><p>Shampoo ran up to Mousse, holding him in her  arms.  "Mousse alright?"  She asked, very concerned.</p><p>"Shampoo, my beloved…stay out of this.  I would hate to see you hurt…" Mousse said,  standing up.</p><p>"Mousse…you such a stupid!"  Shampoo yelled.  "Shampoo help her friend <i>and</i> husband!  Shampoo not afraid to get hurt."</p><p>Mousse turned to her; she was focused in on  Akane.  There was no talking her out of  this.</p><p>"Ryoga!  Are  you ok?"  Ukyo asked, looking at the  bleeding Ryoga.  He pulled out the  daggers forcefully, blood spraying out a bit.   Ukyo took off that blue over shirt she always wore and ripped it in  two.  She started to bandage Ryoga's  wounds.</p><p>Ryoga looked on, amazed.  The only other person that had cared for him so was Akane…Maybe  Ukyo did at least care for him a little bit.</p><p>Akane looked  around, taking in the sights.  In front  of her stood Ranma, holding the bucket of water he had got weakly.  To the left were Mousse and Shampoo.  They were determined to save Akane.  As if she really wanted that.  All she wanted was to defeat Ranma, once and  for all.  Ukyo was taking care of Ryoga  just behind them.  Then there was that  stupid spring that had caused her so much trouble.  That spring needed to be eliminated.</p><p>She hopped up on the nearest pole, placing her hands  together and closing her eyes.</p><p>"I will not have anyone, or anything interfering in  our fight."  She said calmly.  The air around her began to burn…like air  shimmering from a near by fire.</p><p>Ranma took a step back.  He turned around.  She  wasn't aiming at him, but for that spring.</p><p>"<i>Tenrai Ryuujin no Hitorare</i>!"</p><p>Ranma flipped out of the way, dodging the massive  blue flame that shot forth from Akane's hands.   The flames scorched the "spring of drown girl" as well as several  others, rendering them mere holes in the ground.  Akane leapt down from the bamboo pole, satisfied that another  nuisance was removed.</p><p>Ranma ran to where everyone was waiting.  "Hey…everyone Ok?"  He asked.  Everyone  nodded, even Ryoga, who was now standing beside Ranma and Ukyo.</p><p>"What now Ranma?"   He asked.  Ranma had an idea.</p><p>"Hot water Ryoga…that's all we need.  I need you guys to heat up some water…make  enough for a few kettles.  All we gotta  do is splash Akane with the hot water and she would return to normal."</p><p>"I don't know Saotome.  Akane seems determined to fight you."</p><p>Ranma smiled confidently.  "Don't worry about that.   I've been holdin' back my best stuff.   I can handle her.  You guys just  make sure we have enough hot water.  And  do it in a kinda hidden spot or somethin'.   If Akane found out what we were plannin' she would torch you guys too."</p><p>Everyone nodded.   Akane spoke up, losing her patience long ago.</p><p>"Hey Ranma…we done yet?" She asked mockingly.  Ranma walked up to her without a second  glance at the rest of the people behind them.</p><p>"Ok guys" Ukyo started.  "Go find some water.  Me  and Shampoo will start the fires.  Meet  us over there, behind those rocks.   Those trees should block most of the smoke."</p><p>Mousse and Ryoga nodded, running off in either  direction.</p><p><u>How to  Boil Water</u></p><p>"Hey Akane…" Ranma started.  "We don't gotta do this."</p><p>"Oh, yes we do Ranma.  I <i>will</i> defeat you once and for all"</p><p>"No…that's not the Akane I remember.  The Akane I know would never threaten her  friends like that."</p><p>"The Akane you know is dead Ranma!"  Akane shot back coldly.  "This is the new Akane.  All I care about now is defeating you!"</p><p>Ranma approached Akane.  She took a fighting stance.   Ranma was within several feet from her; his guard was down.  So why couldn't she strike?  She took a step back.  Ranma caught up to her, grabbing her hands  gently.</p><p>"Come on Akane…I know this is from the spring, but  deep down, you are still Akane.  Just  like how I was still Ranma, even though I was a girl.  Bein' cursed doesn't change how you think, just what you look  like."</p><p>Akane turned her gaze to the ground.  A tear came down her face.</p><p>"Ranma…I…" Akane started.</p><p>Ranma looked on, hopeful that Akane was still in  there somewhere.</p><p>"Ranma…"</p><p>Akane just looked into his eyes sadly.  A small smile crept upon her face.  "You fell for it!"  She said, grabbing Ranma's hands and launching him over her.  Ranma landed on his feet.</p><p>"Thought I would fall for that?"  Akane asked.  She looked down to her hand.</p><p>"You know…I can still remember all the things you  did to me Ranma.  I remember how many  times you called me "un-cute, sexless, macho chick, flat chested and  tomboyish.  I remember it all."</p><p>"Come on Akane…that was a long time ago…<i>before</i>  we said we loved each other.  We were <i>both</i>  stupid back then, doing stupid things to each other."</p><p>"No Ranma…I tried to tell you how I felt lots of  times.  Each time though, you ruined it,  just like you always do.  <i>You</i>  were the stupid one!"</p><p>Ranma was taken aback.</p><p>"You always managed to two time me with those no  good fiancées of yours.  Catching you in  the bath with Shampoo like that; or on the rooftop with Kodachi; or always  eating at Ukyo's."</p><p>"That wasn't my fault.  You know that Akane!"   Ranma shot back.</p><p>"No…it was <i>all</i> your fault…and to think I <i>used</i>  to love you."</p><p>Ranma took a step back at those words…they had  removed what little Ranma had managed to salvage of his heart.</p><p>"A-Akane…"</p><p>"Shut the hell up Ranma!  The whole time you've been with me, all you have done was make me  miserable!  I would cry myself to sleep  sometimes because of the stupid stuff you would do to me!"</p><p>"Akane, I told you I was sorry!  You said you forgave me…what about that  engagement ring I gave you.  I remember  how happy you were to see it.  You have  a really cute smile…"</p><p>Akane looked to her hand.  She took the ring in her fingers and slipped it off, throwing it  behind her.</p><p>"What engagement ring?"  She asked, smiling, enjoying seeing Ranma hurt like that.</p><p>Ranma turned his head to the ground, closing his  eyes. He could almost feel Akane reach inside him, drawing the very life out of  him.  "I…I tried so hard to get that for  her."  He thought to himself.  He shook his head.  "Come on Ranma, this isn't the real Akane.  But…that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt."  A tear rolled down his cheek.</p><p>"Ranma…you have caused me so much pain.  Now it is <i>my</i> turn!"  Akane shouted.  "I will have revenge for everything you did to me and my  family.  <i>I</i> <i>will</i> <i>defeat</i> <i>you</i>!"</p><p>"Akane…I…can't fight you like this.  I still love you.  We still gotta have our wedding…"</p><p>"Well…consider this my refusal!"  Akane shouted, dashing up to Ranma.  Ranma just stood there, unable to fight  back.  He lost his will to fight <i>and</i>  his fighting sprit.  They were tossed  aside; just like the very ring he gave her.</p><p>Akane planted a solid fist to Ranma's jaw.  Ranma was sent reeling.  Akane swung with a left, Ranma backed up,  avoiding the blow.  Swiftly, Akane  kicked Ranma in the ribs, making him cave inward.  She sprung around with a round house, catching Ranma's head in  the assault.  Ranma was knocked to the  ground.<br/>Quickly, Ranma got back up,  avoiding Akane's heel.  Her heel sank  deeply in the soft sand.  Akane charged  again, throwing her punches.  Ranma knew  this attack and swiftly grabbed Akane's small hands in his.</p><p>"Akane…come on.   I don't wanna fight you."  Ranma  said calmly.</p><p>"Well…I <i>do!</i>   Now either fight back or <i>die</i>!"   Akane yelled sharply.  She leapt  up, placing her feet in Ranma's stomach.   She sprung out of his hands, almost taking his arms with her.</p><p>Ranma fell backward to the ground, flipping and  resuming his standing position.  Akane  eyed him fiercely.</p><p>"Ranma!  I  know you are holding back.  I said fight  me…or I will make you fight!"</p><p>Ranma just stood there.  "Akane…I refuse to fight you over something that was settled long  ago!  I can't bring myself to hit you.  I can't hit my fiancée…I never could hit you  for real…even when we first met."</p><p>"There you go again with that "My Love Akane"  crap.  Listen good Ranma.  You <i>will</i> pay, one way or another, for  hurting me so.  I can never forget your  words…those words made me so angry…I could have killed you back then.  Now…let's try this again.  Fight me…now! Or suffer the consequences…"</p><p>"Akane…I would rather die than fight you.  I love you too much to hurt you like  that.  You say I hurt you so bad all the  way back then, yet you insist on me fightin' back!  Well that ain't gonna happen.   I would rather die…if that made you feel any better."</p><p>"Please Ranma…I was just trying to have a bit of  fun…but…if that's how you want it…" Akane said, smiling.</p><p>Ranma glanced back.   No one was around.  Akane hadn't  noticed their plan.  If he could buy  just a bit more time…but still…this was harder than he thought.  Akane's jeers made Ranma lose most of his  fighting sprit.</p><p>Ryoga looked around, again he was lost…and worse  yet…he was lost when he was needed most.</p><p>"Akane…Ukyo…Ranma…I have let you all down…" Ryoga  thought to himself.  "No…I will not give  up!  I will find my way back to the  camp!"  Ryoga said audibly, stumbling  though a thick section of bushes.</p><p>"Akane…Ukyo…everyone…fear not.  Ryoga Hibiki will <i>not</i> be lost this  time!"  He said loudly, emerging from  the bushes.</p><p>"Well that's good Ryoga."  Ukyo said, smiling up to him.</p><p>Ryoga's eyes widened.  He was already here…he didn't get lost after all.</p><p>"I…I found my way back…" Ryoga said, stunned.</p><p>"Whatever sugar, save it for later.  We gotta help Ran-Chan!"</p><p>"Oh…of course.   Here is the water."</p><p>"Great…you got a kettle on you?"</p><p>Ryoga went though his pack, pulling out two.  Mousse carried two as well.</p><p>"Good, that gives us four chances to hit Akane.  We better make it count."</p><p>"I don't know Ukyo…we may need more help than just  us.  Where is Cologne?"</p><p>"Great-Grandmother say she go look for guide.  Must have passed by him on accident."  Shampoo said, worriedly.</p><p>"Great…there's no telling when she will be  back."  Ukyo said, lighting a fire.  Shampoo helped her, putting the cold kettles  on the fires.</p><p>"Now what?"   Mousse asked.</p><p>"Now…we wait here."   Ryoga returned.</p><p>"Hopefully watched pots do boil…" Ukyo started.  Shampoo nodded, watching her pot.  They would each get one:  one chance to save Akane <i>and</i> Ranma.</p><p>"I hope Saotome can pull it off."</p><p>"Yea…me too."   Ukyo said, looking at her fire.   It needed more wood.  More wood  would mean a higher temperature.</p><p><u>Best of  Four</u></p><p>Ranma leapt into the air, dodging Akane's  onslaught.  He flipped over her,  avoiding the kick she sent to him.</p><p>"Come on Ranma…fight me for real!"  Akane demanded.</p><p>Ranma remained resolved.  Just a few more minutes…only a few minutes to endure this  torture.  He looked around.  Everyone sure was taking their sweet  time.  They should have been ready by  now.</p><p>After what seemed like hours to Ranma, Ukyo opened  the lid to a kettle, sticking her hand in.   She almost got burned.  She  looked to everyone with a nod.</p><p>"Ok guys, let's go!"  Ukyo said, holding the kettle.   It was pretty hot.</p><p>"Wait a second.   We need to have a plan of attack."   Mousse started.</p><p>Ukyo nodded.   They group sat there, thinking for a few minutes, hearing the sounds of  the fight.</p><p>"I got an idea…come here everyone!"  Ukyo said at last.  She whispered her plan to everyone.  They all nodded.</p><p>"Got it?"  We  only have four chances for this…otherwise I don't know what we could do next."</p><p>They all ran out towards where Akane and Ranma were  fighting.</p><p>Ranma went flying into the stone cliff face, leaving  a giant crater in the wall of the mountain.   He sunk to the ground, in pain.   Akane approached him, throwing a fist at his head.  Ranma rolled out the way, hearing Akane's  fist <i>crunch</i> through the rocks.   Her hand went clean through.<br/>She turned, facing Ranma.  They were both breathing heavily, but  neither one would just simply give up.</p><p>Ranma wiped a bit of blood from his lip.  His defense was all the way up but Akane  still managed to find holes in it.  This  form she was in, she seemed to focus all her rage into fighting.  Ranma suddenly got an idea.  He <i>had</i> to go on the offensive, even  if it was just to buy a bit of time.</p><p>"Still won't fight me Ranma?"  Akane asked, taking a fighting stance.</p><p>Ranma did not respond.</p><p>Akane charged him.   Ranma started backing up, dodging the blows.  His footsteps made a spiraling circle that traced over a small  part of Jusenkyo.</p><p>"She always fell for this…" Ranma thought to  himself.  "With this much anger…this is  sure to stall her for a bit longer…"</p><p>Ranma reached the final step.  He focused in, planting his foot.  Abruptly, he stopped, seeing Akane taking  the same stance as he was.</p><p>"<i>Sakishima Hiryu Shoten Ha</i>!"</p><p>Ranma clenched his eyes, having been caught in the  violent twister of rage that Akane had unleashed.  The twister threw him hard against a tree, breaking it.  The tree fell to the ground, making a large  crash.</p><p>Ranma forced himself to sit up, watching Akane come  closer.</p><p>"Ok Akane…that's it…you win…" Ranma forced himself  to say.</p><p>"No…not yet Ranma.   You are still conscious."  Akane  raised her fist, shooting it down to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma suddenly felt something.  He threw his hands out, catching the  object.  It was a tea kettle…a <i>tea  kettle</i>!  Ranma held it between him  and Akane, hoping Akane would shatter the thin metal with her fist.</p><p>Akane's eyes widened.  She tore her arm away from the attack desperately.  Ranma sat up, opening the top of the kettle  and launching the hot water towards Akane.   She jumped back, a few drops of the hot water hitting her leg.  Not enough to invoke a transformation.</p><p>Ranma cursed his luck as Akane turned, seeing  Shampoo standing a few feet away.</p><p>Akane quickly surveyed her surroundings.  Ranma was no longer a threat; she could deal  with him later.  Those other people though…they  were trying to pour hot water on her.   She wouldn't have that.  Not  until she had got her revenge.  She  glanced one final time at Ranma, sitting up weakly before she shot off to  Shampoo.</p><p>"You will not ruin this for me!"  Akane yelled, throwing a punch at  Shampoo.  Shampoo flipped over her with  amazing speed.  Akane whirled, looking  into Shampoo's eyes.  She had that  familiar look…that look she took when they were fighting.  She was using her ultimate technique.</p><p>Shampoo charged, swiping at Akane.  She threw up her arms, blocking the  blow.  Shampoo tried for a kick to her  face.  Akane leaned back, thrusting her  hand towards Shampoo's foot.  She  grabbed her ankle.  Shampoo was now  standing on one foot.  She jumped,  bringing her last foot around, aiming for Akane's head.  Akane used her forearm to block the foot,  grabbing the second one.  She heaved,  spinning around once and throwing Shampoo against a tree.  Skillfully, Shampoo clawed the tree,  rebounding off of it and diving to Akane with a kick.  Akane narrowed her eyes.   She sidestepped the attack, grabbing Shampoo's arm and twisting it  around her back.  Akane ducked behind  her, some hot water striking Shampoo squarely on the face.  Akane then shoved Shampoo away from  her.  Shampoo turned, that look still in  her eye.  She charged Akane again.  Akane smiled.  She caught Shampoo in the jaw with the heel of her foot.  She then spun around, landing a powerful  kick to Shampoo's head.  Shampoo fell to  the ground.  Akane walked up to her,  surveying the damage.</p><p>Mousse looked on, standing on a near by pole.  He saw Akane plant Shampoo in the  ground.  His heart had enough.  He jumped down, right in front of Akane,  having used his kettle of water already.</p><p>"Mousse…what you do?"  Shampoo asked, weakly.</p><p>"Don't worry my love, I shall protect you from this  menace!"</p><p>"Mousse no!   You already got hurt bad enough!"</p><p>Mousse just stood there.  "We still haven't finished out little fight Akane." He said,  chuckling to himself a little bit.   Shampoo just watched.</p><p>"Show me what you've got Akane!"  Mousse said, dashing to her position.</p><p>"Have it your way…" Akane said.  She focused in; time seemed to slow  down.  All it would take was one move…</p><p>"<i>Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken</i>!"</p><p>Akane enveloped Mousse in a flurry of fists, sending  him crashing into the ground.  Shampoo  ran over to him, checking to see what condition he was in.  He was knocked out.  Shampoo eyed Akane angrily.</p><p>Akane ignored the two.  "Now…for the other ones."   Akane said, walking along and looking for them.</p><p>Shampoo reached inside Mousse's sleeve, pulling out  another kettle of water.</p><p>"Was our plan…but Mousse is knocked out right  now.  Ryoga have one left."  She said, handing it to Ranma.  Ranma got up painfully, watching Akane walk  off.  He nodded.</p><p>"Hey…don't worry Shampoo.  I've done worse than that to Mousse before.  He will be fine after a few minutes.  You just stay here.  We'll take care of the rest."</p><p>Shampoo smiled as Ranma walked off.  She looked to Mousse's form, lying  there.  His love of her was indeed great…maybe  she was finally starting to understand what he had felt all this time…</p><p>Akane entered a conspicuous clearing.  She jumped back, seeing Ryoga attempt to  splash her from above…she knew that was coming.</p><p>Ryoga took his stance, seeing that Akane was ready  for a fight.  Their last hope was  Ranma…and he was nowhere to be found.</p><p>"Akane…please forgive me," he thought to  himself.  Suddenly a tap came from his  shoulder.  It was Ukyo, standing next to  him</p><p>"Hey sugar…you're in no condition to fight.  I'll stall her while you go find Ranma."</p><p>"Ukyo…there's no way you can stop Akane.  She beat you once already didn't she?"</p><p>Ukyo winked at Ryoga.  "Trust me…this won't last long at all."</p><p>Ryoga looked at her, worriedly.</p><p>"Go on, Ranma is waiting for his fiancée."  She said with a smile. Ryoga ran off, he was  the last person that needed to be sent to find someone, but his arm was badly  hurt and he had trouble walking.  It <i>had</i>  to be him.</p><p>Ukyo unsheathed her spatula, pointing it at Akane.</p><p>"This ends now Akane!"  Ukyo said.</p><p>"You're right Ukyo…this <i>does</i> end now."  Akane said, launching herself towards  Ukyo.  Ukyo parried Akane's fist with  her spatula.  She punched again.  Ukyo jumped back, swinging her massive  spatula.  Akane easily dodged that  blow.  Ukyo swung again.  Akane caught the spatula between her  hands.  She twisted it, snapping the  cold steel in two.  Ukyo took a few  steps back…what power this cursed Akane had…</p><p>Ukyo quickly gained her resolve back.  She ran to Akane, launching a punch.  Akane easily grabbed her hand, twisting it  around.  Ukyo screamed out in pain as  Akane just watched.  She forced her hand  out of her grasp, holding it.  She  didn't know if it was broken or not.   She backed up a bit, seeing Akane walk closer to her.  There was no way she could take her in her  cursed form.  But…she was determined to  help those two, no matter the cost.</p><p>"Hey…Akane!"   Called a voice from behind her.   It was Ranma, walking there confidently.  Akane whirled, ignoring Ukyo for the moment.  Ranma seemed to have recovered his fighting  spirit.</p><p>"Ranma…so you want to fight now?"</p><p>Ranma cracked his knuckles.  "Yea…let's see what you can do now that I  won't hold back."</p><p>Akane smiled.   "<i>Finally</i>…although it took you long enough."</p><p>Akane dashed to Ranma's position with a right.  Ranma moved his head slightly, catching a  glimpse of Ukyo.  He winked at her, just  briefly.  He then went on the attack  against Akane.</p><p>Ukyo eyed him there, confused.  She looked around.  Ryoga was on the other side, waving the final kettle of  water.  He noticed that Ukyo was looking  at him.  He turned his eyes up to the  sky.</p><p>Ukyo eyed Ryoga's gesture carefully.  Suddenly, it hit her.  She nodded at Ryoga, keeping a careful eye  on the fight.  She slowly moved her good  arm down her chest, grabbing a mini spatula.</p><p>Ranma launched a punch to Akane.  She jumped over it, trying to kick Ranma in  the face.  Ranma jumped to the ground,  rolling under Akane's body.  Akane  landed, going on the attack again.   Ranma flipped off the ground rebounding off a tree, and flew to Akane's  position.  Akane sidestepped the  attack.</p><p>"Dammit!"   Ranma cursed.  "Akane was  supposed to jump to avoid that…" he thought to himself.  He turned around, noticing that Akane was not  giving up the offensive.  She threw a  kick at Ranma.  Ranma placed his hands  on her foot, flipping over her expertly.</p><p>Ranma thought for a minute…if Akane would just jump  high enough…Akane burst in, interrupting Ranma's little thought sequence.  Ranma back flipped, landing a few yards away  from Akane.  She was running towards  him.  This was it…it may mean taking out  a few more springs but he had to save Akane.</p><p>"Ok Akane…time to end this!"  Ranma shouted, placing his hands together.</p><p>"<i>Moko Takabisha</i>!"</p><p>"Is that the best you can do Ranma?"  Akane asked, jumping over the energy that  thundered underneath her.</p><p>"Ukyo! Ryoga! Now!"   Ranma yelled, smiling up to Akane.   She looked down, seeing a kettle soaring up to her position.  She managed to move her head, dodging the  metal object.</p><p>"So much for that huh Ranma…Let me show you how it's  done." Akane said.  She placed her hands  together.   She seemed to almost hover  in the air. Suddenly, a small <i>ching</i> came out of nowhere.  She looked up, losing her focus.    The kettle was cut in two.  Shocked, she looked down to Ukyo, smiling  slyly.  It was too late to move.</p><p>The hot water landed on Akane, dousing the fires of  rage that had burned within her. She landed, almost losing her balance.  She blinked her eyes, looking around.  Ryoga was wrapped in a familiar blue  cloth.  Ukyo was standing there, holding  her arm.</p><p>"What…what happened?"  She asked in a whisper.   It hit her.  She had fell into  that cursed spring.  All the feelings of  anger came back.  She looked sadly into  the ground, tears stinging her eyes.</p><p>Ranma approached her.</p><p>"Hey…Akane…is that you?"  He asked.  Akane looked up  to him, tears in her eyes.</p><p>"Oh Ranma…it was horrible!"  Akane said, grabbing him.  Ranma placed his arms around Akane.</p><p>"Hey…its gonna be alright."  Ranma assured her.</p><p>"Ranma…I remember everything…I…I tried to hurt you  just now.  I hit Ukyo for no  reason.  I…I said I didn't love you  anymore…Ranma, I'm so sorry!  It was  stupid of me to fight here.  I just  wanted to see how good I had become.   I…didn't mean for any of this to happen."</p><p>Everyone approached the two.  Ranma looked at them approvingly.  Akane was still crying in his arms.</p><p>"Hey guys…thanks for the help" Ranma started at  everyone.</p><p>"Well…it was the least we could do Saotome" Mousse  replied.</p><p>"I think we should just get outta here.  Where is Cologne at?" Ranma said with a  sigh.</p><p>"Don't Know…" Shampoo said.  "Great-grandmother supposed to be back by  now."</p><p>Ranma nodded, looking around at all the damage.  Trees had been broken and lie on the  ground.  A few craters here and there  and some springs were completely dry.   Good thing they were on the north side.   Nothing important was there.   Ranma noticed the Guide, still laying face first in the ground.</p><p>"I think we should help him…" Ryoga said, also  noticing.  He and Mousse went to him,  picking him off the ground and leaning him against the rocks at the entrance of  Jusenkyo.  Ranma and Akane followed  everyone else.  Akane refused to let go  of Ranma.</p><p>"Ranma…" she tried.</p><p>"Akane…I told you it was ok.  That's what a cursed spring could do to  you."</p><p>"No…it's not that…" Akane said, sadly indicating her  finger.  It seemed so different with no  ring on it.</p><p>"Hey…that's ok too.   I'll just get ya another one…better yet; I'll replace it with a wedding  band.  What do you think?"  Ranma offered a smile.</p><p>Akane just looked into the ground.  "But Ranma…that ring was so special to  me.  I…I can't believe I did that to  you…"</p><p>Ranma just held Akane as she started to cry  again.  It was a rough day for everyone.</p><p><u>Relapse…</u></p><p>"So…what now…" Ukyo asked after a few minutes.</p><p>"I guess we just wait for that Guide to come  to."  Ryoga returned.</p><p>"Yea…that's a…" Ranma started.  A low rumble interrupted the rest of his  sentence.    His eyes widened…that  couldn't be…He looked up into the sky.   Lighting and thunder.</p><p>Everyone's was taken aback.</p><p>"Oh man…you gotta be kiddin' me."  Ranma said, frustrated.  Akane held him tightly.</p><p>"Ranma…I…don't want to transform again!  You have to do something!"</p><p>"Ryoga!   Where's that umbrella you always carried around?  Quick before it rains!"  Ryoga sprung up, running off into  Jusenkyo.  He saw it, broken in two  under a fallen tree.  Desperately he  turned back to Ranma and Akane.</p><p>"<i>Ranma</i>…<i>please</i>…I don't want to hurt you  like that again…" Akane sobbed.  Ranma  looked to the south.  A wall of rain was  quickly approaching them.</p><p>Everyone looked around, searching for  something.  The forest was already  enveloped in rain and all means of shelter were damaged. There was no time…</p><p>Akane just cried in Ranma's chest.  "Ranma…I'm so scared right now.  I…don't know if I can hold back the next  time…"</p><p>"Don't worry Akane…I'll protect you…I promise.  I will find a way to cure you!"  Ranma assured her.  She looked up into his eyes.   They kissed each other, almost as if saying a sad good bye.  The rain hit everyone hard, the wind blowing  the cold water around.  Akane backed up  slowly, eyeing female Ranma.<br/>"Ranma, I love you!"  Akane said sadly.</p><p>The rain covered her.</p><p>"I love you too Akane!"  Ranma said.  Akane looked  him in the eye.  She had changed again.</p><p>"Don't give me that I love you crap, Ranma!"  She yelled.   "We sill have a fight to finish, or did you forget?"</p><p>"Fine Akane…I'm female now…that means I am even  faster than before.  If you want a fight  for real I'll give it to ya!"  Ranma  asserted.</p><p>Akane eyed the red haired girl standing before  her.  She was as focused as  herself.  This would be fun.</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath.  There was one thing left…and she would have to fight to make it  happen.  She narrowed her eyes at Akane.</p><p>"So Ranma…where were we?"  Akane asked.</p><p>"I believe I was about to win the duel."</p><p>Akane just smiled, dashing over to her.</p><p>Ukyo and the others looked on.  That was all they could do.  Ukyo looked to all the animals that  surrounded her, holding her arm.</p><p>"Ukyo be ok?"   Shampoo asked.</p><p>"Yea… I'll be fine…"</p><p>Everyone watched silently for a few moments.</p><p>"I hope Ran-Chan knows what he's doing."  Ukyo thought to herself.  She watched the battle ensue, worried for  both of her friends.</p><p>*****Hope that was a nice little surprise. That took  me a while to think of a nice curse to give Akane. I thought to myself, what  would be Ranma's greatest challenge? Why, his fiancée of course. Then all I had  to do was make them fight. Hence, the spring of drown Oni. Hope you liked it.  We're getting closer to my other fan fictions. I better start working on those,  or else I'm gonna end up being left behind. And there were a few questions. I will  answer them.</p><p>Yes, this is a reposted version of the Original  Obsessions, about a year ago. And I am the original author. In fact, I have the  notes in my portfolio to prove it. All the ideas I didn't use.</p><p>And Shiro Inazuma! I sent you the email man! I was  real busy. And yea, it's not much different. Only the first couple of chapters  had to be changed. The later ones were fine in my opinion.</p><p>What's the next chapter about? Ranma Vs Akane. That's  the title of it. That should placate curious minds, or drive those that don't  wanna wait, insane. In any case, until next we meet!*****</p>
