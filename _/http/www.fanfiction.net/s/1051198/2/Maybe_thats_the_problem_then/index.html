</div><p style="text-align:center;">When she's right, she's right!</p><p style="text-align:center;">By Kalio</p><p>Disclaimer: same as for the first chap.</p><p>A/n: This is a bit less humorous and more romantic. In fact, the tone changes quite a bit because he's no  longer dealing with Nabiki, but with Akane. Don't let that scare you, though, my friend says it's still  good, so I'll try to believe her. Enjoy!</p><p>Ranma sat nervously outside of the dojo by the koi pond. After the initial rush thinking about the next  huge step in his life, he began to get anxious. What if he was right and Akane really did think he was  just a pervert jerk? What if Nabiki was just kidding and really did want him dead? What if... the list  went on longer the longer Nabiki was in Akane's room. The biggest what-if was one he really didn't feel  like sharing in his head, let alone sharing it with anyone outside of it. What if Akane wanted...? The  tense ki floating around him was almost visible, sending lightning sparks in every direction. I can't do  this, he thought, trying to muster up as much macho bravado as he could.</p><p>For once in his life, he failed miserably at such a task.</p><p>"Yo Ranma!" Nabiki strode across the lawn smiling gleefully. Ranma jumped around five feet in the  air, almost landing in the koi pond. Nabiki grinned, expecting no less of a startled jump from the  fighter.</p><p>Ranma turned toward Nabiki, furious. "Don't DO that! That time you almost did give me a heart  attack!" He panted a bit then looked back up at the oh-so-pleased girl. "What do you want?"</p><p>Nabiki smiled her 'trust me' smile. "Akane invited you to her room for in around five minutes. I would  get ready if I were you." She smirked a bit more for good measure.</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath to calm himself. "Alright. Did she look mad? Pissed? Plaid? How about  happy? Nauseous? Did I mention pissed?" Ranma stood up and awaited her answer.</p><p>"You'll just have to go see yourself, if you want to know!" Nabiki replied bouncily. Ranma didn't like it.</p><p>"Oh. By the way, 5,000 yen."</p><p>Nabiki's jaw dropped. "What?"</p><p>"That's the down payment on any sort of documentation you get off this, so I suggest to turn off all the  gear you got in there." Ranma smirked seeing Nabiki's abashed but newly respecting face.</p><p>"Gotta hand it to ya, Saotome, that was pretty slick. Alright, you got it." She pulled out a remote and  flipped one switch out of one hundred. There was a slight 'zzt' sound, and most of the buzzing produced  by her surveillance equipment died. "Satisfied?"</p><p>Ranma smiled. "Not quite. If there's any evidence of what goes on up there at all, I'll still charge you, so  you might want to turn off all the battery operated equipment, too."</p><p>"Damn!" Nabiki took out the remote again and flipped another switch. "Well, you got me. Have fun."  She grinned at him again, but she seemed a little more deflated than before.</p><p>Ranma slowly made his way toward the house. Jumping on the roof, he walked quietly over to Akane's  window and hung just outside it. Fidgeting, he cautiously knocked on the window, jarring the pane of  glass. He almost fell when Akane opened it, startling him.</p><p>Akane blushed. "Hello, Ranma," she whispered. "Come on in." She stepped back, allowing Ranma to  climb onto her desk and into the room.</p><p>"Hey, Akane." Ranma was a funny shade of red, but he was to freaked out to care. His head spun. "You  beckoned?" Ranma took the time to notice Akane's outfit, which was odd since she was had just come  back from a local kendo tournament. She wore a loose, blue kimono, a white under-kimono , and a  white hakama. And, he noticed, with a thrill down his spine, bindings. Breast bindings. As opposed to a  sports bra. She was slightly disheveled, but not too worse-for-wear. He took another calming breath.  'Breathe Saotome, breathe.'</p><p>"Er, yes. About that conversation with onee-chan... was it for real?" She looked up into his eyes, blush  disappearing for only a moment.</p><p>He gulped. "Yeah... every word. What about you? I mean, is your sister right about  reverse-psycho-bable-ology-ish stuff and whatnot?"</p><p>"...I guess so. I never really thought of it that way, but I guess she's right." Her eyes shot again to the  floor.</p><p>Ranma stared at the top of her head. "Ano...does that mean you want me to-" But he was silenced by a  hand over his mouth. Akane looked up into his surprised eyes.</p><p>"Don't. Remember what Nabiki said? Do you like me? Cause if you don't, then don't bother finishing  that sentence."</p><p>Ranma stared for a few moments and his expression softened. "Yeah, I like you a lot, Akane. I'd love  ya, but I'm not that lucky." He smiled warmly, hoping she felt the same way.</p><p>Akane grinned up at him with her eyes shimmering in happiness and tapped him on the nose. "Fill in  the blank, Ranma." As close as they were, she wrapped her arms around his waist and leaned against  his chest as he responded to her embrace.</p><p>Ranma grinned a funny grin, and picked her up. "Hai, koishii." He set her down on the edge of her bed,  so that they could sit. He felt really odd. 'I mean one minute, we're arguing and she calls me a hentai,  and the next thing I know, she's practically sitting in my lap, and giving me permission to, you know,  TOUCH her. Like places that clothing normally covers...' Needless to say, he felt funny and kind of  perverted, but not enough to make him want to stop the whole process.</p><p>Akane nuzzled her face into the hallow of his shoulder, and hugged him tighter. Then, she looked up at  him expectantly. Taking her hint, Ranma reached forward and cupped her face in his hands, and kissed  her lightly, closing his eyes. She reached up and meshed her fingers through his hair, kissing him back.  The two exchanged lighted kisses for a few minutes, and then Akane opened her eyes and stared  devilishly at Ranma's closed eyes before brushing her tongue lightly, but insistently at his closed lips.  He opened them without a fuss, pleased at her advance, and held her closer.</p><p>The pair sat together on the bed, tongues dancing to a rhythm all their own. Ranma ran his hands  ever-so-lightly down her back and back up again, sending shivers down Akane's spine. She pulled away  from the kiss, gasping. Then she ran a trail of short, sweet kisses down his cheek and over his neck to  his shoulder, pulling back the red silk material of his Chinese shirt. It was Ranma's turn to shudder, as  she blew lightly into his ear and looked back up at him with an evil smile, warmth radiating from her.</p><p>Ranma cupped her face in his hands and rubbed his thumb lightly over her cheekbone, staring intently  into her eyes, searching. "Did I ever tell you out loud how much I love you?" Akane tried to blink away  the tears of joy forming in her eyes, and she laughed slightly, sniffing.</p><p>"Nope. We were too busy arguing over whether it mattered to say it out loud or not!" Ranma smiled,  and brushed a tear gently away, love shining in his eyes. He leaned forward and kissed her nose in  feather light motion, an odd gesture for a world-class martial artist, but he did it anyway, making her  giggle in delight. "Silly..."</p><p>Ranma grinned. "Well then, if I never got the chance away from prying cameras and eyes, I wanted to  tell you I love everything about you. Even your cooking." Before Akane could protest, he kissed her  again to muffle any sort of outraged cry about her cooking, and it seemed to have worked. She leaned  back onto her bed and pulled a surprised-looking cursed man down with her. (Not that he minded...) He  propped himself up, trying not to crush her, and pulled back, taking his turn at placing butterfly kisses  down her neck and collarbone, gently brushing her bangs off of her forehead. Her hands lightly grasped  the back of his shirt while she tilted her head to the side, accepting the kisses.</p><p>"I love you, too, Ranma. Very much." She said it so quietly that he almost did not hear her. He  wondered briefly if maybe she didn't want her heart broken, or if she didn't mean it, but his fears were  silenced, as she lifted her head to whisper in his ear. "Even the things that drive me absolutely batty  about you, I love. I want you to know that, with all my heart."</p><p>~A/n: Unfortunately, guys, in order for me to keep the rating at PG-13 (and I may move it up to R on  the council of you all), I need to cut out this section. If you are over 17 and want the full version of  this, the next chapter, or both, please email me at: .com</p><p>Anyway, here's the rest of the clean version!~</p><p>Ranma jumped out of Akane's window, and landed gracefully on the lawn. He had a lot to think about.  He sat by the koi pond, much more relaxed and happy. In the middle of his thoughts about Akane,  though, a sudden thought struck him.</p><p>'Man, I hate it when Nabiki's right!... well, not this time, but still!' The thought lasted approximately  four seconds before his thoughts returned to Akane.</p>
