</div><p>Part 2: Beating a Dead Horse<p>After having somehow survived the trauma of seeing his best<br/>friend married suddenly, Ranma would naturally be expected<br/>to laugh and blow it all off one moment, then turn around<br/>and begin weeping uncontrollably the next. This was<br/>actually quite normal for Ranma, and Kasumi was already<br/>working on a consolation meal for him.<p>Ranma, however, had started to become dignified and even<br/>respectable. It would possibly become him more to bottle up<br/>his anger for a few days, then let it all vent out in one<br/>brutal and defensive tirade. Nabiki had already put a stack<br/>of magazines together in her room, and was getting ready for<br/>a long siege.<p>On the other hand, Ranma never took well to being girl-type.<br/>If he was stuck for some time as boy-type it would then<br/>follow that he was now stuck as girl-type. Ranma would<br/>possibly spend a few hours trying to turn back, then run<br/>away somewhere to unwind. Akane might have already guessed<br/>this much and would have been packed and ready to go. If<br/>Akane had known-that is-she would have been ready.<p>Instead, Akane came to dinner that evening to discover that<br/>Nabiki and Ranma had not turned up, and she was mildly<br/>surprised but not altogether bothered by it.<p>When she went upstairs, she briefly thought about knocking<br/>on the door to Ranma's room and having a nice little<br/>conversation, but she decided at the last moment to let it<br/>wait.<p>Later that evening, Kasumi had come by her room and had<br/>asked about Ranma, but Akane didn't know where he had gone.<br/>When Akane went to bed, she briefly fretted about him,<br/>thinking every time she heard a noise outside that it was<br/>Ranma.<p>When Akane found herself looking outside from her window for<br/>the tenth time, she realized it was time to get serious with<br/>herself and send herself to bed.<p>The next morning, Akane noticed Genma and was briefly<br/>relieved-thinking that if Genma was there, it would only be<br/>natural for Ranma to turn up. She was a little shocked,<br/>however, when Genma later chuckled and asked Akane if she<br/>had seen Ranma.<p>When she got over her shock, Akane quite naturally grew<br/>angry, blaming Ranma for her distress. If he was going to<br/>run off, fine-but he could at least tell someone about it,<br/>first. She went to school that day, determined to tell him<br/>off, and then maybe beat the tar out of him for good<br/>measure.<p>When she arrived at class, she discovered that no one had<br/>spotted Ranma. Several times, friends of hers would show up<br/>and ask her where Ranma was. Akane even overheard rumors<br/>that she had finally gone berserk, killed Ranma, and buried<br/>his body in the backyard.<p>Akane could bear it if Ranma had run off and had left her<br/>for good. She could shrug it off for a week or two, then<br/>eventually recover in a few years or so. She could even<br/>bear the stigma of ugly rumors about herself and Ranma.<br/>Akane knew that rumors would fade in time. What she could<br/>not bear was the fact that she was worried about him and she<br/>had no way of knowing what had happened.<p>It was typical of him, though. Ranma would make some stupid<br/>decision that would put everyone else in a difficult<br/>position. Even worse, whenever confronted with the<br/>evidence, Ranma would come up with an asinine excuse for<br/>making them upset. It made her so mad at times that Akane<br/>would inadvertently scare people into believing the rumors<br/>about her being a killer even more-which would only<br/>frustrate her more.<p>Of course, there were times when Ranma was in serious<br/>trouble and wouldn't be able to explain himself. Ranma had<br/>been attacked and kidnapped so many times that Akane was<br/>starting to lose count. And how many times had Ranma been<br/>attacked that Akane didn't even know about? Akane knew<br/>quite well that if Ranma had been attacked, his pride would<br/>never allow him to admit it-if the situation was just as<br/>well without it. There were many times when Ranma wouldn't<br/>admit to being hurt or humiliated, even when Akane had<br/>witnessed it.<p>Whenever Akane began thinking this way, she would become sad<br/>and upset on his behalf-thinking that she wished there was<br/>a way she could know something that would help. Then, she<br/>would inevitably discover her mood had dipped, blame it on<br/>Ranma for being an idiot, and become angry all over again.<p>Thus, Akane rode the roller coaster of her emotions all day<br/>at school, hoping for some word about Ranma, and also<br/>dreading that she might hear something about him-that he<br/>had been hurt or killed, for example. Ranma had made many<br/>enemies, over the years, after all.<p>At one point, Akane had heard the rumor being whispered for<br/>the thirtieth time about her being a murderer, and she<br/>screamed, "I wish I had killed that idiot! If I don't find<br/>him soon, he's a dead man!"<p>After that, people began adding that if Akane were ever<br/>brought to trial, she would almost certainly plead insanity.<p>***<p>Over the next few days, it was becoming obvious that Ranma<br/>wouldn't turn up, so Soun and Genma went out looking for<br/>him-an activity that mainly consisted of hanging out at all<br/>the bars and ramen shops in the areas they were "searching."<p>Just as they were starting to get short on funding-and they<br/>were starting to seriously consider finding Ranma-Akane<br/>resolved the matter by furiously setting out on her own.<p>Akane at once chose the Cat Cafe as the first place to look,<br/>and, of course, immediately found Ranma there-hiding out in<br/>the kitchen, eating a bowl of ramen.<p>What followed was a hideous scream that could be heard for<br/>miles around.<p>***<p>In a flash, Akane had Ranma by the shirt front, and had<br/>slammed him up against the wall.<p>"Yo, Akane," he said.<p>"Ranma!" Akane shouted. "Do you enjoy torturing me! I've<br/>been worried sick about you, and all you do is..."<p>One moment, Akane had been in a rage. The next moment, she<br/>suddenly found herself confused and almost a little<br/>mortified. "Ummm..." she added. She let Ranma go, and<br/>blinked several times-as if to convince herself that she<br/>really was looking at Ranma.<p>While Akane was scanning Ranma, he turned away-somewhat<br/>disgracefully-and looked downward.<p>It was fairly obvious to Akane now that Ranma had turned<br/>back to girl-type. He had become a she-with the breasts to<br/>prove it. Once Akane had settled that matter in her mind,<br/>she again flared, "What the hell is wrong with you!"<p>"What?" Ranma said, suddenly defensive.<p>It was at times like this that Akane would find herself.<br/>Suddenly, she found that she just didn't care anymore. "Let<br/>Ranma just do whatever he or she wants," she thought to<br/>herself. She turned and left-or rather, she thought about<br/>turning and leaving, anyway. She turned and caught herself<br/>weeping without any awareness of why she was weeping-other<br/>than maybe her eyes just had a mind of their own.<p>She turned to Ranma again and asked her, "Why? Why do you<br/>keep doing this to me?"<p>"Akane..." Ranma began, and suddenly they discovered that<br/>they had an audience.<p>Without them realizing it, Soun, Genma, Kasumi-who was busy<br/>serving tea to Soun and Genma-Nabiki, Cologne, Shampoo, and<br/>several of the customers had packed themselves into the<br/>kitchen to overhear this conversation.<p>Ranma scowled and said, in Chinese, "I think it would be<br/>better if we had less of an audience."<p>Akane looked around, took the hint, and answered in Chinese,<br/>"I think you're right."<p>Cologne joined them and said, "Now, that's a good idea."<p>Shampoo added, "Uh-yuh. Dats a good idea, uh-right."<p>As Cologne rolled her eyes, Ranma and Akane groaned briefly<br/>-to think that Shampoo's speech impediment wasn't limited<br/>to just Japanese.<p>***<p>When they realized they were being left out of the<br/>conversation, most of the audience left the kitchen. Soun,<br/>however, stayed through most of it. Although he couldn't<br/>understand a word of it, he liked the non-verbal<br/>communication going on between Akane and Ranma. It seemed<br/>to him that they were finishing each other's sentences, and<br/>that they would even sometimes share a little inside joke<br/>with each other. Whatever it was, it was definitely<br/>something Shampoo took a disliking to, and Shampoo soon<br/>stormed out of the kitchen.<p>Maybe it was just Soun's imagination, but whatever they<br/>talked about, Akane would just get angry if asked about it<br/>-and, of course, Shampoo would refuse to discuss it.<br/>Cologne would say that it was personal and leave it at that.<br/>If they ever asked Ranma, he would gladly answer-in<br/>Chinese. So, whatever they talked about was just between<br/>Ranma and Akane.<p>Kasumi, however, managed to pick up a few little details<br/>here and there over the years, and eventually wrote that<br/>Ranma had been terribly embarrassed to discover that he'd<br/>reverted to girl-form again, and had simply not wanted<br/>anyone "important" to him to see him that way. Now, of<br/>course, this was totally out of character for Ranma-or even<br/>Ranma's "alternate" personality-so we may never know what<br/>was actually said.<p>Maybe Soun was already thinking optimistically, and maybe<br/>Akane was just flattering herself-and helping Ranma save<br/>face. But whatever they talked about, it did upset Shampoo<br/>quite a bit, although none of them felt guilty enough to go<br/>placate Shampoo.<p>Ranma did, in fact, return to the Tendo home afterward, and<br/>it was found out for certain that Ranma was stuck in girl-<br/>form. This was nothing particularly new, and Akane's<br/>sisters were at a loss why Ranma would react the way she<br/>did.<p>There was a subtle difference in the way Ranma looked,<br/>but only Nabiki noticed it-from having photographed Ranma<br/>so many times-and Nabiki was keeping it to herself for now.<p>In the kitchen, Ranma asked if she could help out with<br/>making supper, and Kasumi was more than happy to let Ranma<br/>help, this time.<p>At supper, Ranma was careful-yet still swift-about eating,<br/>and she was heading toward her room for an early trip to bed<br/>when the next big problem suddenly arose.<p>***<p>Ranma glanced back around at the table as she stood and<br/>said, "Well, g'night everybody. Big day tomorrow. Lots of<br/>homework, too..." Ranma said this last part under her<br/>breath, already dreading the assignments she had missed, and<br/>she reflexively looked to Akane.<p>At first, Ranma didn't really notice, and she was in the<br/>hallway-halfway to the stairway at the entrance-when she<br/>turned and dashed back toward the living room.<p>"Ak... Ak... Aka-!" Ranma exclaimed, pointing at Akane.<p>The others reacted in mild surprise, looking at Ranma as if<br/>she had suddenly gone insane.<p>"Wha-?" Akane started.<p>"Your f... fuh... fuh... fuh..." Ranma explained.<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes and obligingly glanced at Akane,<br/>earning herself a shock, in the process. "Ngyah!" Nabiki<br/>added.<p>"You have a w... wuh... wuh... wuh... thingy..." Ranma<br/>continued.<p>"A what?" Soun asked, as Kasumi looked at Akane, curiously.<p>"Oh my!" Kasumi said, and now everyone was looking at<br/>Akane's face-even Akane, who suddenly had a hand mirror.<p>"AAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGH!" Akane screamed, unable to withstand<br/>the sight of her own face. Once again, there were whiskers<br/>on her cheeks.<p>"Akane," Nabiki started, "have you been in the super soba<br/>again?"<p>"Why?" Akane answered. "Why! Why! Why!" She punctuated<br/>each question with the slamming of her hand on the table.<p>"Oh my, oh my, oh my..." Kasumi added.<p>"I guess not," Nabiki replied to herself.<p>Soun, who had already been through so much this day, simply<br/>got up-reeled just a little-and headed straight for bed.<br/>Genma seemed totally oblivious to all this, only staring at<br/>the TV as if there were nothing in the world happening.<p>Ranma, who had been staring, suddenly smirked a tiny little<br/>smirk, was about to say something, then suddenly thought<br/>better of it.<p>Akane dashed off to her room, weeping as she went.<p>***<p>Now, the next day, Ranma had every right to still be upset<br/>and to think that every teacher who chewed her out or made<br/>snide remarks about her absence was worth throwing a temper<br/>tantrum over. No one would have blamed her, had she begun<br/>muttering about the huge piles of work they gave her to do-<br/>especially when those piles of work included assignments<br/>that Akane was now missing, since she had mysteriously<br/>disappeared from school.<p>It might reasonably be expected that Ranma would grow<br/>irritated at the increasing attention Kuno-who was<br/>convinced that the "pigtailed-girl" had returned just for<br/>his benefit-was giving her.<p>One might have even expected Ranma to become annoyed at all<br/>the explanations people were demanding of her. There<br/>certainly weren't any shortage of people asking.<p>Ranma, however, was nothing more than amused by all this.<br/>Quite often, Ranma would find a way to set the groups of<br/>people demanding explanations against Kuno-and thus resolve<br/>the matter to her satisfaction.<p>To Ranma, schoolwork had always meant more teeth-grinding<br/>than actual work, and her pleasure at Akane's expense had<br/>guided her smoothly through her usual anticipation. In<br/>fact, she hardly noticed it when she had finished working.<p>She was so absorbed in doing all this work that unpleasant<br/>remarks about her absence and her current state were simply<br/>ignored, and Ranma even drifted through her practice<br/>sessions with Genma.<p>At home, Ranma was becoming so studious that Soun more than<br/>once confused her with Kasumi, which made Genma begin to<br/>refer to Ranma as "Kasumi," rather mockingly.<p>Nabiki-who had always enjoyed toying with Ranma and Akane-<br/>began referring to Kasumi as "Ranma," but soon grew bored<br/>with Kasumi's narrowed gaze and indulgent sighs. Ranma and<br/>Akane were no fun for her, though. Ranma was spending too<br/>much time working to notice Nabiki, and Nabiki was too<br/>nervous to visit Akane. Akane was starting to give everyone<br/>the creeps.<p>Every night, nevertheless, Ranma visited Akane's room to<br/>give her the assignments she was missing while she was<br/>"sick."<p>***<p>Upon entering Akane's room, Ranma made the usual nightly<br/>flinch of ever-growing disgust.<p>Once, Akane's room had been simple and neat-almost Spartan<br/>in its neatness. Akane had always encouraged and even<br/>welcomed light into her room, and the light had always<br/>seemed to gleam with a modest and understated glow.<p>Now, it seemed that Akane's room was a dark and forbidding<br/>place-a place where even shadows would turn away from the<br/>hideous shapes that lurked in the corners. Though Ranma had<br/>begun to think of Akane's room as an unpleasant place to<br/>have to go, these thoughts were nothing compared to the<br/>reality of her room, now. Now, she was actually afraid.<p>Many times in the past, Akane would sit at her desk or go to<br/>the balcony and gaze up at the stars. Akane had always been<br/>wistful and musing.<p>All that Ranma could see of Akane now were the two glimmers<br/>of faint lights that he assumed were reflections of the<br/>hallway in her eyes.<p>"Ranma," Akane said, her voice strained but otherwise<br/>unchanged. "Come in and close the door, would you?"<p>Ranma took a deep swallow and entered, trying the light<br/>switch as she entered. The darkness continued, and-if<br/>anything-perhaps became a little deeper. She tried it a<br/>few more times, and she *felt* more than could see Akane<br/>smirking at her. As Ranma closed the door, she felt her<br/>heart sinking as deep as the darkness suddenly became.<p>"Sorry about the light," Akane said, "but I just got sick of<br/>looking at myself."<p>It was a little disconcerting to Ranma to hear Akane<br/>speaking so casually in such a setting. It made Ranma all<br/>the more speechless that Akane had even admitted to looking<br/>at herself.<p>Just as Ranma began to wonder, Akane said, "Yeah, it's<br/>getting worse." This unsettled Ranma even more-wondering<br/>if Akane had suddenly been able to read her mind. "I doubt<br/>you would recognize me, Ranma," she added.<p>Ranma felt a chill as she realized that she *had* once been<br/>unable to recognize Akane, and Ranma's first thought was to<br/>protest that things were different, now.<p>"Not that you care, of course," Akane added. "Right,<br/>Ranma?"<p>"Hey-" Ranma started, and was immediately cut off by<br/>Akane's soft laughter.<p>"What?" Akane said a little skeptically. "You weren't about<br/>to deny it, were you? Ranma, don't make me laugh."<p>Ranma wasn't sure whether she was more offended by Akane's<br/>accusations or by the fact that they were mostly true.<br/>"I've cared about you a hella lot longer than you cared<br/>about me," she found herself saying, and immediately<br/>realized it was her alternate personality.<p>"Oh yeah?" Akane answered.<p>"Yeah," Ranma said, a bit weaker. "Don't get the wrong<br/>idea," she added. "I just ain't the jerk you seem to think<br/>I am."<p>Akane snorted, and whether it was from laughter or from<br/>choking back a sob, she added, "Now, how did you ever get<br/>that idea?"<p>Girl or boy, Ranma could never stand these touchy-feely<br/>situations, and she promptly changed the subject. "I got<br/>your assignments for today."<p>Akane took the stack of papers from Ranma and immediately<br/>asked, "Why are they wet?"<p>"Well," Ranma said somewhat sheepishly, "I got caught in the<br/>middle of Kuno fighting with his sister again, and I had to<br/>go fish them out of the canal..."<p>Akane audibly sighed as Ranma continued her story of this<br/>latest adventure, becoming all the more bored as Ranma<br/>became all the more enthusiastic in telling it.<p>Bored though she was, Akane listened intently to every<br/>detail. Her brooding and her gloom hadn't quite affected<br/>her attitude. Akane knew that listening to Ranma was<br/>important, even if many of the things she said were absurdly<br/>trivial.<p>She did have her limit, though. Just as Ranma was warming<br/>up to how she had caught the scent of something that smelled<br/>like a certain fried fish and seemed about to embark on an<br/>epic of her previous adventures in fish-and all the<br/>different scents fried fish could have-Akane realized that<br/>enough was enough, and promptly shoved Ranma out the door.<p>Before she fully realized it, Ranma was talking to herself<br/>in the hallway. She laughed for a moment, then folded her<br/>arms and became petulant as she added, "Now, that was rude!"<p>***<p>Akane's affliction was a topic of some discussion around the<br/>dinner table over the next couple of days, and it was pretty<br/>much assumed that Ranma was the only possible cause and<br/>solution to this affliction-despite the fact that they<br/>could neither prove that Ranma had had anything to do with<br/>it nor that they even knew what it was that Akane was<br/>suffering from.<p>Ranma felt pretty strongly-and her alternate personality<br/>whole-heartedly agreed-that there was not only no share of<br/>guilt to be dealt to her, but that there was no practical<br/>way she could even start to solve the problem-whatever it<br/>was.<p>No one except Kasumi could even say for certain what Akane<br/>even looked like, and Kasumi would refuse to talk about it.<br/>Ranma had no real interest in seeing Akane's face. Ranma<br/>had a slight, lingering curiosity, but that was the extent<br/>of it. Akane would certainly not oblige Ranma's capricious<br/>(and frequently unbearable) gaze, and Ranma knew her well<br/>enough to not even ask.<p>Try as she might, though, nothing Ranma did could shake a<br/>feeling of some amount of responsibility, and it was really<br/>beginning to get irritating.<p>What was worse, Ranma began to think that this situation was<br/>familiar in a way, and that she really ought to know who was<br/>behind it, by now.<p>Just as she was thinking that-and finishing off some bread<br/>she had been snacking on-she happened to cross paths with<br/>Shampoo-who had just finished a delivery, and was returning<br/>to the Cat Cafe.<p>"Nihao!" Shampoo greeted her. "Ranma come looking for<br/>Shampoo!"<p>Ranma watched in fascination as Shampoo grabbed her by the<br/>arm and began to cuddle with her. "I don't change back, you<br/>know," Ranma said.<p>"I no care," Shampoo said. "I know Ranma's heart is man."<p>Ranma sighed and realized that Shampoo had immediately sized<br/>up the situation. Without giving it much thought, Ranma<br/>began to also realize that what she really needed was to get<br/>away from all the stunned glares of people watching her and<br/>Shampoo, and to get into a nice big fight-preferably one<br/>she could rightfully expect to win (anything with the words<br/>"martial arts" in the title ought to be good enough).<p>And just then, as if fate itself had read her mind, Ranma<br/>suddenly found herself looking at the infamous "Cat Temple,"<br/>which had provided Ranma with many memorable torments, not<br/>too long ago. Looking at it now, Ranma felt a surge of<br/>excitement in her manly heart and cracked her knuckles,<br/>saying, "Shampoo, I'm not sure I should tell you this, but<br/>I've recently gotten over my fear of cats."<p>Ranma missed it, but Shampoo was shocked into silence by<br/>this confession.<p>Ranma continued, "I'm not exactly sure how, but I've<br/>suddenly come to feel that I can even grow to love cats."<p>"Aiyaa!" Shampoo tried to say, but found that she had no<br/>voice. It didn't matter. Ranma wasn't looking at her.<p>As Ranma dashed toward the old, abandoned temple, Shampoo<br/>took a moment to collect herself before chasing after.<p>***<p>Ranma knew, perhaps better than anybody, that she'd been<br/>trained well to be terrified of cats, and one does not<br/>simply overcome a fear by willing it to be. Under normal<br/>circumstances, it would have taken many years of intensive<br/>retraining for Ranma to have had any success with her<br/>phobia-and, even then, she would still have many years of<br/>relapses to look forward to.<p>Ever since her "transformation," however, Ranma began to<br/>sense that there was powerful magic at work in her mind. As<br/>a well-trained martial artist, Ranma knew the connection and<br/>harmony between the mind and body, and so it was no surprise<br/>to Ranma that this magic would affect her conditioning, as<br/>well.<p>How the magic worked, exactly, was a mystery even to Ranma.<br/>All Ranma knew was that when the other personality took<br/>control, she wasn't even slightly bothered by cats. And<br/>ever since Ryoga left, Ranma began to feel that losing<br/>control wasn't such a bad thing.<p>The only thing that bothered her, in fact, was that she<br/>began to feel strangely bored all the time, and there was a<br/>persistent feeling in the back of her mind that no one was<br/>really listening to her.<p>Ranma rushed up to the entrance and was unsurprised to see<br/>the giant monster cat, Mao Mo Lin, appear literally out of<br/>thin air from a large, floating bell. Mao Mo Lin seemed<br/>delighted for a moment, then flinched in shock.<p>"Ack!" he said, waving his paws at Ranma. "Keep away or<br/>I'll bite you!"<p>Ranma smiled and calmly took in the sight of Mao Mo Lin<br/>looking away as he brandished his paw at Ranma pathetically.<br/>A moment later, Shampoo appeared and bludgeoned the cat with<br/>a kick to the head.<p>"Crazy cat!" she said. "What you do with Ranma?"<p>"Relax, Shampoo," Ranma said. "I ain't freaked out about<br/>this guy anymore."<p>"Owwie!" the cat cried. "What'd you do that for?"<p>"You shut big cat trap!" Shampoo blared. "You want Shampoo<br/>get mad?"<p>"Heh," Ranma said, folding her arms. "It's okay. It's<br/>okay. Cats don't scare me."<p>"Is that so?" the cat said. "Maybe I should do this..."<p>Mao Mo Lin growled and hissed in feline fury, then slowly<br/>deflated back to normal when he saw that it wasn't making an<br/>impression. Ranma again cracked her knuckles, and said,<br/>"You better get ready, cat, cause I've been savin' this up<br/>for a long time."<p>***<p>Outside the Cat temple, several passersby turned to see what<br/>all the commotion was-hearing several loud crashes and<br/>thuds.<p>***<p>Ranma was in a good mood for supper that night, so no one<br/>bothered her about finding a cure for Akane-in fact, Soun<br/>began thinking that Ranma was close to finding one. Genma,<br/>however, recognized that mood, and he switched to panda form<br/>as soon as he saw it-knowing that Ranma would be anxious to<br/>fight again as soon as possible, and that she would probably<br/>still be strong and keen with those kicks.<p>Nabiki, infected by the mood, had teased Ranma a few times<br/>about her impending visit with Akane in the dark-<br/>insinuating that Ranma and Akane were doing naughty things<br/>when they were all alone. Ranma had thought it was a little<br/>sickening, but it didn't really bother her. Nabiki had to<br/>stop, though, when it seemed that Kasumi was about to get<br/>really upset over the idea.<p>Nabiki was somewhat alarmed when Ranma insisted that, since<br/>Nabiki was suspicious of their doings, she would just have<br/>to take care of matters, herself. It was an unusual move<br/>for Ranma, and suggested to Nabiki an unusual cleverness in<br/>Ranma. Ranma wasn't serious, of course, much to Nabiki's<br/>relief.<p>In fact, Ranma was becoming a little possessive of these<br/>private moments with Akane. It was disturbing, but Ranma<br/>couldn't explain it. Part of the problem lay in solving the<br/>underlying mystery.<p>When Ranma arrived at Akane's room-and after the usual<br/>nightly flinch of ever-growing disgust-she immediately<br/>demanded to know what Akane looked like, tried the light,<br/>and immediately regretted it.<p>Scattered all over the floor were scraps of paper and<br/>clothing, dishes and chopsticks, and all manner of cords,<br/>thread, and broken pieces of wood. For several moments, all<br/>Ranma could do was stare in wonder at all the junk that had<br/>been left all over Akane's room-and she briefly marveled<br/>that she had never tripped over it, all the previous nights<br/>that she had come there.<p>When she looked at Akane, however, Ranma saw something that<br/>completely startled her. For a brief moment, Ranma thought<br/>Akane had turned into a human-sized cat, and Ranma had to<br/>suppress a residual urge to panic.<p>"That's quite a reaction," Akane told her. "I thought you<br/>said you wanted to know."<p>"Gyah," Ranma said, finally uncoiling from her shock. "I<br/>wasn't expecting this."<p>Akane had become furry, and she had the ears, paws, and tail<br/>of a cat. It was understandable that Ranma would get that<br/>first impression.<p>"Let me guess," Ranma said. "You were cursed by Mao Mo<br/>Lin."<p>"Don't tell me you knew!" Akane said, sharply.<p>"It just came to me," Ranma said, matter-of-factly.<p>Just then, Ranma noticed that the others had appeared behind<br/>her, and she slammed the door shut.<p>"You realize what this means?" Akane added.<p>Ranma pondered for a moment, but then said-without any hint<br/>of thinking, "Another curse you have to break with a kiss?"<p>"Uh huh," Akane replied. For a long moment, they seemed to<br/>be contemplating the side effects of an intentional<br/>collision between human mouths, and comparing such a thing<br/>to insects intentionally striking the windshield of a<br/>speeding car.<p>Clearly, at this moment, Ranma was of two minds. Part of<br/>her said, "So what? It's just a kiss. Get over it."<br/>Another part of her said, "Hold on, a sec! This isn't<br/>something you just leap into!" What was perhaps more<br/>astonishing was that she couldn't sense her alternate<br/>personality in any of this. Ranma had no awareness of<br/>having said anything about breaking a curse with a kiss, yet<br/>she was aware of the effects of *someone* forcing her into<br/>making this decision. "Whoa!" Ranma said, clenching her<br/>head.<p>"Let me get something straight," Ranma continued. "When<br/>exactly is this supposed to be complete?"<p>Akane took a deep breath and said, "The full moon." Ranma<br/>then dashed to the window and looked out. "Hey!" Akane<br/>said, a little outraged to be ignored. "Ranma-!"<p>Ranma breathed a sigh of relief and leaped out the window.<br/>She then called upward, "I'll be back before then!"<p>"You jerk!" Akane screamed. "Get back up here! I wasn't<br/>finished!" Her voice had just started to echo into the<br/>darkness when Ranma was gone.<p>Just then, Shampoo appeared-just out of sight of Ranma-and<br/>she smiled at Akane. Akane was as sensitive as always, and<br/>she recognized in that smile that Shampoo was telling Akane<br/>that she had known all along about the curse-and had even<br/>instigated it-and that Akane may have thought she had the<br/>upper hand, but Shampoo believed the situation would soon<br/>change.<p>So, when Shampoo carefully chased after Ranma as Akane<br/>watched from her room, Akane clenched her furry paw and<br/>vowed, "You haven't won yet, Shampoo!"<p>Akane then caught her reflection from the window and<br/>flinched in brief disgust at herself.<p>***<p>By now, all this odd behavior had become the norm for Ranma<br/>and the others. In fact, Soun Tendo had become so<br/>accustomed to spying on Ranma and Akane, that the only thing<br/>he could remark as he stood in the hallway outside Akane's<br/>door was, "Hang in there, Akane!"<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes as Kasumi muttered, "Oh my..." Genma<br/>put a hand on Soun's shoulder and said, "You know, Tendo. I<br/>think Ranma's starting to come around."<p>"Too bad he's stuck in girl-form," Nabiki added.<p>"Isn't the full moon tomorrow?" Kasumi asked.<p>As the others wandered off, Kasumi began to wonder, and she<br/>went to her room in search of a good almanac.<p>***<p>Ranma soon returned to the Cat temple, thinking that Mao Mo<br/>Lin had foolishly remained in his tangible form, or that the<br/>giant monster cat could somehow be persuaded to confront<br/>her. When Ranma arrived, she realized she was full of ideas<br/>on how to extract information on beating curses, but she<br/>hadn't given any thought to how she was going to find the<br/>cat to begin with.<p>Thus, alone in the dark of the temple grounds-aside from a<br/>few dozen alley cats-Ranma sat and began thinking about how<br/>to draw Mao Mo Lin out of wherever he was hiding.<p>Just about the time she was thinking of heading out to the<br/>Cat Cafe, Shampoo saved her the trouble and appeared.<br/>"Ranma no find big cat, here," she said.<p>Ranma, who still had no idea that Shampoo was involved,<br/>said, "Shoot! I really needed to knock some sense into him,<br/>too."<p>"Already knock sense out of cat," Shampoo told her. "Ranma<br/>no get curse off Akane, anyway."<p>"What'd you say?" Ranma asked, becoming annoyed at the way<br/>Shampoo was smirking.<p>Shampoo walked up to Ranma and stood next to her as she<br/>said, "Mao Mo Lin just crazy bell monster. He no take curse<br/>off for no reason, and no even you take curse off."<p>This whole conversation already had a surreal quality to it<br/>without Shampoo having trouble using proper grammar. Trying<br/>to follow what Shampoo was saying was beginning to take its<br/>toll on Ranma's overworked psyche, and Ranma said, "Huh?"<p>"You want Akane become cat?" Shampoo asked.<p>"No," Ranma replied. "Of course not."<p>"Curse is beat by kiss of man who victim love," Shampoo<br/>supplied. "If no man love or if love no is man, no is<br/>beating curse."<p>Ranma could nearly always follow what Shampoo had told her<br/>before. Now, it just seemed all jumbled up. "If who does<br/>what?" she asked.<p>Shampoo glared at Ranma for a moment. "Girl-being make<br/>Ranma stupid?"<p>Ranma frowned and folded her arms.<p>Shampoo sighed and explained, "You no beat curse."<p>"I can't?"<p>"No."<p>"Why not?"<p>"You no can do it."<p>"You just said that. But what I'm asking is-"<p>Shampoo groaned and punched Ranma in the head. "I just say<br/>you! You no can! You no is man, and Akane no love anyway."<p>"Hmmm..." Ranma said. Ranma rubbed her chin and thought, as<br/>Shampoo folded her arms and narrowed her gaze at Ranma. At<br/>last, Ranma hit her palm in realization and said, "I got<br/>it!"<p>Shampoo smiled and said, "Now see?"<p>Ranma thought for another moment and said, "Wait. No... I<br/>forgot. Why can't I beat the curse?"<p>***<p>Ranma became lost in thought for several hours, sitting<br/>there at the Cat temple. She found herself petting a cat as<br/>she suddenly realized what Shampoo had given up trying to<br/>tell her.<p>In an instant, Ranma said, "Of course! I'm a girl, so the<br/>curse wouldn't break for me, anyway!"<p>Ranma then punched herself in the head, also realizing how<br/>long it had taken her to figure that out.<p>Just as she was starting to feel pity toward Shampoo for<br/>having had to explain it all in vain, Ranma also suddenly<br/>realized that Shampoo had been the one who had facilitated<br/>the curse.<p>With Akane out of the way-most likely, married to the cat<br/>monster-Shampoo would be free to date with Ranma. Shampoo<br/>would ignore the fact that Ranma had already developed<br/>feelings (in a way) for Akane, and that even if Akane was<br/>out of the picture, Ukyo was a somewhat more pleasant person<br/>to date than Shampoo.<p>***<p>By midnight, Ranma had brought Akane back with her to the<br/>Cat temple. Just as she suspected, Akane changed back to<br/>her usual self the moment they entered the temple grounds.<br/>They also had another moment when Mao Mo Lin appeared, but<br/>Ranma and Akane both beat the stuffing out of him until he<br/>vanished again.<p>"All right, Ranma," Akane started. "What is this plan of<br/>yours?"<p>Right on cue, Dr. Tofu showed up, giving Akane a really good<br/>start.<p>"Dr. Tofu?" Akane said. "What is he doing here?"<p>"I sent for him," Ranma explained, "to break the curse."<p>Akane punched Ranma in the head and said, grimly, "What the<br/>hell did you do that for, huh? You don't expect me to kiss<br/>him, do you?"<p>"Ow!" Ranma said, rubbing her head. "Well, I didn't have a<br/>whole lot of choice! I ain't a man, you know! Maybe you'd<br/>rather kiss Kuno!"<p>Dr. Tofu approached them and cleared his throat, saying,<br/>"Excuse me, but I was told that someone out here needed<br/>medical attention..."<p>"Maybe I would," Akane said to Ranma.<p>Ranma went to Dr. Tofu and said, "Yeah, Dr. Tofu. It's<br/>Akane. I think she's got something in her eye."<p>"Uh huh..." Dr. Tofu mused. "You called me out here in the<br/>middle of the night to look at Akane's eye?"<p>Akane put her face in her hand, mortified.<p>"Oh, yeah," Ranma said, gesturing in an annoyed but<br/>reassuring way to Akane. "It's small, but it doesn't seem<br/>to want to come out."<p>"I guess I can have a look," Dr. Tofu muttered.<p>As Tofu opened a small bag he was carrying with him, Ranma<br/>went to Akane and whispered, "It ain't gotta mean nothin',<br/>Akane. I figure you just need an actual guy to break the<br/>curse. Just kiss 'em an' get it over with."<p>"Fine, fine, fine..." Akane mumbled, still plenty mortified.<br/>Ranma tried to sneak away, but Akane grabbed her by the arm<br/>and whispered, piercingly, "This is a rotten thing to do,<br/>and whatever happens is your fault!"<p>Just as Ranma planned, Dr. Tofu stood over Akane, looking<br/>into her eyes. "Which one?" Tofu asked her, and Akane<br/>answered by pointing out her right eye.<p>Ranma made a "V" with her fingers and mentally patted<br/>herself on the back. "I am so clever," she told herself.<p>Akane, who had seen some of that, rolled her eyes and nearly<br/>forgot what she was doing.<p>"I don't see anything," Dr. Tofu said, reaching for his<br/>light. "Just a sec..." He took his light and shined it<br/>directly into Akane's eye, making a pretty thorough search.<p>Ranma cringed in anticipation. Akane had always been<br/>reluctant about doing anything that might seem girlish, and<br/>her youthful crush on Dr. Tofu had become more of an<br/>irritation to her, lately. Still, Ranma felt certain that<br/>some of the old magic must still remain, and she was very<br/>surprised when several long moments passed without anything<br/>more happening except Dr. Tofu muttering about not finding<br/>anything.<p>Dr. Tofu was ready to give up, but Ranma insisted that he<br/>try again-giving Akane an evil glare in the process-but,<br/>no matter how much Akane might have felt tempted to kiss<br/>him, she just couldn't bring herself to do it. Akane even<br/>shoved Tofu away at one particularly close moment.<p>"Oh, are you all right?" Tofu asked. "I didn't hurt<br/>anything, did I?"<p>"No," Akane answered. "I'm fine." Akane then returned the<br/>glare back at Ranma for a moment, then added, "I think it's<br/>gone."<p>"That's a relief," Tofu said. "For a moment there, I was<br/>certain you were trying to kiss me."<p>***<p>Ranma escorted Akane home, even when she returned to her<br/>half-cat appearance outside the temple grounds. Although<br/>Ranma walked beside her, Akane didn't say a word, the whole<br/>way home. Akane only frowned and muttered to herself the<br/>entire time.<p>At the entrance, Ranma was just about to climb the stairs to<br/>her room when Akane said, rather loudly, "Ranma! You are a<br/>complete idiot! What made you come up with such a stupid<br/>idea!"<p>And, instead of waiting for an answer, Akane stomped her way<br/>up the stairs past Ranma-slamming her door shut as she<br/>entered her room.<p>Ranma was still a little stunned by Akane's insult, and took<br/>a moment to collect herself, then started becoming angry.<br/>"Why that macho tomboy! How dare she! It was a great<br/>idea! She's the one that screwed it up!"<p>At the top of the stairs, Ranma was so intent on her fuming<br/>that she nearly tripped over Kasumi-who had suddenly<br/>appeared in the hallway.<p>"Ah!" Ranma said, flinging herself to the side to avoid<br/>hitting Kasumi. "Excuse me!"<p>"Oh, Ranma," Kasumi said. "Is Akane back? I forgot to tell<br/>her something."<p>"Yeah," Ranma replied. "She's back, all right. She brought<br/>her attitude with her, too."<p>"Oh my," Kasumi stated. "This could really be a problem."<p>As Ranma watched in growing amazement, Kasumi went to<br/>Akane's door and knocked.<p>"Go away, you jerk!" came Akane's voice from inside. Kasumi<br/>opened the door and said, "Akane, I really need to tell you<br/>something..."<p>"Oh, I'm sorry, Kasumi!" Akane said.<p>"You see," Kasumi said, "It's about the full moon.<br/>Actually..."<p>Just then Shampoo appeared and said, "Moon full tonight!"<p>Akane rushed out into the hallway and said, "Tonight?"<p>As Akane stood frozen in shock, Shampoo was overcome by the<br/>giggles and began pointing at Akane. "Akane is real cat-<br/>girl!"<p>Akane's face-which had become somewhat haggard from not<br/>eating or properly training-was smeared with tears. Now<br/>that Akane had become furry, it was pretty obvious how she<br/>felt, because the tracks of her tears left dark, ugly lines<br/>under her eyes where the fur had become moist.<p>Ranma had been moments away from chewing out Akane, and now<br/>she felt more pity for Akane than ever. Looking at her now,<br/>the impression of Akane being a large cat was unmistakable.<br/>If Ranma had left herself in control, there could be little<br/>doubt that she would have fled in terror.<p>Kasumi, who had merely been trying to be helpful, added,<br/>"Actually, the full moon is in precisely two minutes."<p>"You be bride of cat monster!" Shampoo added, "And Ranma now<br/>mine!"<p>Akane, hearing the mockery from Shampoo and seeing the pity<br/>in Ranma's eyes, was hit by a double-dose of shock. There<br/>was a long, agonizing moment when she was sorely tempted to<br/>start growling and pound Ranma through the roof. She might<br/>have done this, and even Kasumi might have said it was for<br/>the best-this had become the worst humiliation yet for<br/>Akane, and Ranma might never learn, otherwise.<p>When she looked again at Ranma's eyes, Akane was impressed<br/>by the notion that she wasn't really looking at Ranma, but<br/>at someone far more devious and insightful. She saw pity,<br/>but she also began to see real sympathy, as well. This<br/>wasn't a new thing for Ranma, though, and it puzzled Akane<br/>for a moment until she realized that Ranma nearly always<br/>seemed to be suffering some humiliation-either something<br/>Akane had inflicted or something she had done little to<br/>prevent.<p>And then, seemingly triggered by this realization, memories<br/>of Ranma began to swarm in her mind. There were a great<br/>many foolish things Ranma had said, to be sure, and Akane<br/>remembered Ranma's hasty apologies. What was surprising to<br/>her was that Akane herself had said many more foolish things<br/>to Ranma and had apologized many more times-and in a way<br/>that seemed even more childish than any of Ranma's. Akane<br/>even began to realize that many of the situations were her<br/>own fault-going back even to the day they had met (for<br/>which Akane had neither apologized insincerely nor had even<br/>felt guilty about).<p>But these were the kind of thoughts one has when one is<br/>expecting to part from someone forever, and Akane realized<br/>above everything else that she could bear anything but that.<br/>The weight of this realization sent her to her knees, where<br/>she wept and could hardly be expected to hear any<br/>consolation.<p>Even Shampoo was a little astonished to see this reaction.<br/>Kasumi immediately went to Akane and hugged her, saying,<br/>"It's all right, Akane. We'll still love you, even if you<br/>are a cat for the rest of your life."<p>"That's not it," Akane tried to say, but her sobs were<br/>robbing her of breath.<p>Ranma helped Akane get up, and Kasumi was surprised to see<br/>that Ranma had somehow changed back to male. "Ranma,"<br/>Kasumi started. "How the heck-?"<p>In his mind, however, Ranma could only imagine how Ryoga<br/>would react to all this, and it made his stomach churn. No<br/>matter how uncute or how brutal Akane could be, she didn't<br/>deserve to suffer like this.<p>Shampoo could only watch in helpless shock as Ranma helped<br/>Akane stand again and kissed her, just as it seemed Akane<br/>was about to transform for good.<br/>
