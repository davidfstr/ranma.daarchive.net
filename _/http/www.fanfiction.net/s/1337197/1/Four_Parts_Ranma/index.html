</div>  Four Parts Ranma<br/>by Mike Fenton<p>[Foreword]<p>These characters belong to Rumiko Takahashi. This is a<br/>free fanfic, not intended for profit of any kind. You may<br/>leave a review if you wish, however, if you prefer to get<br/>feedback, you should visit the www-orangeangel-com forum.<p>The following narrative deals mostly with Ranma and Akane,<br/>and it is written in a more traditional style than any of<br/>my other works. In the following story, Ranma drinks from<br/>the water that gave him the curse, and it has a strange<br/>effect on him-he goes through a course of subtle<br/>personality changes that become more profound as the story<br/>continues. Ranma starts to realize that these changes are<br/>triggered by events that cause people close to him to leave<br/>him. Not only does his personality change, but his gender<br/>changes-and in a way that getting splashed with water<br/>cannot change...<p>***<p>Part 1: Horsing Around<p>It was a very old saying among the Amazons that to drink<br/>from the Jusenkyo springs one had drowned in would leave you<br/>with half a mind; and although no one doubted it, no one<br/>could quite say what it meant, either.<p>No one could remember testing it, since even setting foot<br/>near the forbidden springs was considered bad luck, and to<br/>force someone who had been unlucky enough to drown there to<br/>drink from that same spring would be considered even worse.<p>The springs themselves were very ancient and filled with<br/>mystery, so finding the same springs would be difficult.<br/>Even if you could find a guide to those springs, there was<br/>no guarantee he would show you the exact same springs.<p>So, of course, there was no telling what awful thing might<br/>happen-and therefore, there was no excuse at all for<br/>Shampoo not to have noticed that she had accidentally given<br/>Ranma a full glass of the water of nyanniichuan (or, "spring<br/>of drowned girl") into which Ranma had drowned some time<br/>ago.<p>"Aiyaa!" Shampoo said to herself, finally noticing what she<br/>had done. The full glass of ordinary water remained on her<br/>serving tray, as Ranma set the now empty glass on the<br/>counter and began toward the exit of the Cat Cafe-having<br/>noticed Akane entering.<p>Shampoo, unable to contemplate the mistake she had made,<br/>took the ordinary water and poured it onto her own head-in<br/>the vain hope that perhaps she had not actually made a<br/>mistake, and could now demonstrate to her beloved Ranma that<br/>she would not transform into the cat that she now<br/>mysteriously transformed into.<p>There was nothing new about Shampoo changing into a cat like<br/>this, but for Shampoo to be the most annoyed at becoming a<br/>cat was something slightly new. The patrons of the shop<br/>were mostly absorbed in their own conversations, ignoring<br/>this relatively mild turn of events.<p>Ranma was absorbed in greeting Akane-who was acting<br/>strangely irritated at Ranma. Akane made an angry gesture,<br/>and Ranma flinched, then started to placate Akane-massaging<br/>her back. All this behavior seemed very strange to Shampoo,<br/>and she leaped after Ranma before fully realizing that she<br/>was still a cat.<p>Normally, whenever confronted by a cat, Ranma would run<br/>away-screaming in terror. Now, however, Ranma seemed<br/>strangely torn within himself.<p>"Ranma!" Akane warned, but before Akane could stop him,<br/>Ranma picked up Shampoo the cat and began to pet her.<p>"Nice kitty," he said, taking a moment to scratch her under<br/>the chin.<p>Shampoo was at once struck by the oddness of this situation<br/>and the pleasure of having her chin fur scratched this way.<br/>She purred in her usual way and took a moment of unusual<br/>contemplation.<p>"Ranma," she thought, "must have half mind, for sure."<p>Akane, who was unaware of the Amazon saying, said to Ranma,<br/>"You realize that's a cat, right?"<p>"Huh?" he said, looking from Shampoo to Akane and back to<br/>Shampoo. A moment later, he screamed in terror and bolted<br/>from the shop in his normal way, tossing Shampoo high up<br/>into the air. Shampoo landed in the way that all cats do-<br/>exactly on all fours-straight on top of the counter.<p>Akane gave Shampoo a suspicious glance, then brushed it<br/>aside-obviously thinking that Ranma had been seized by a<br/>moment of normalcy, and that such things must eventually<br/>happen in lieu of the usual terrors-which would fade in<br/>time, after all.<p>It didn't occur to Akane that she had never gotten over<br/>her own fear of tasting her own food or of losing her<br/>beloved P-chan, but that was beside the point.<p>Akane did, however, notice an odd brooding in Shampoo's eyes<br/>that even her cat form couldn't disguise. Shampoo then<br/>turned an icy cat-glare at Akane, which forced Akane to<br/>suddenly forget what she was thinking and to depart at once<br/>from the shop.<p>***<p>It was obvious to Nabiki and Kasumi that Ranma had suddenly<br/>changed. The usual half-aware smugness in his expressions<br/>would sometimes fade into stony calm or quiet confidence.<br/>Nabiki suddenly felt as though Ranma was, at times,<br/>approachable and even affable. Later, she found herself<br/>thinking about Ranma, and briefly wishing she could emulate<br/>that side of him that she had seen in those moments.<p>Kasumi noticed that sometimes Ranma did not appear nervous<br/>or flighty, and that she actually felt genuine concern or<br/>warmth in his demeanor. It struck her as odd that Ranma<br/>offered to help with the food and that he was even home as<br/>soon as he was.<p>Akane and Soun-her father-were as oblivious as could be to<br/>this sudden change, and Kasumi was never comfortable talking<br/>about anyone's personality traits to their face, so Nabiki's<br/>efforts at the dinner table to bring it up in conversation<br/>were futile.<p>Genma-Ranma's father-noticed right away that Ranma seemed<br/>to be seized by a completely separate personality, but he<br/>shrugged it off in the usual way he always did in times like<br/>this.<p>Ranma himself, not a complete fool, quickly picked up on<br/>what Nabiki was trying to say. Although he denied it at the<br/>time, the more he thought about it, the more it made sense.<p>In fact, Ranma was both blandly unconcerned and acutely<br/>interested in this state within himself. It didn't quite<br/>occur to him until later that his interest mainly depended<br/>on which personality was in control.<p>The one thing he knew for certain was that this change in<br/>himself was a constant problem, and that this condition<br/>would appear at any moment for no particular reason.<p>He was, in essence, like two people living at the same time<br/>in one body. Half of him found it very disturbing, and the<br/>other half shrugged it off in the normal way that Ranma<br/>generally did all things of this nature.<p>***<p>Now, the time went by in the usual way over the next few<br/>days. People sometimes said that Ranma had become more<br/>interesting than ever, and the girls at Furinkan high<br/>school, in particular, began to whisper among themselves<br/>about Ranma's manly charm and to give Akane the evil eye<br/>whenever she passed.<p>Ranma, who had always kept Akane at arm's length in spite of<br/>them being engaged, seemed delighted at this situation<br/>(whenever he wasn't faintly amused by it). Akane, on the<br/>other hand, was less than thrilled.<p>After school on this particular day, Akane was in a hurry to<br/>leave and in no mind to confront Ranma, especially. When<br/>she happened to notice him standing on a nearby tree branch,<br/>she turned up her nose and strode away with a look that<br/>threatened the stamping of her feet if things should turn<br/>out even worse.<p>Ranma was puzzled for a moment, then muttered to himself,<br/>"She's just jealous." He looked up and noticed an<br/>attractive girl wearing a boy's uniform and a huge spatula<br/>strapped to her back, standing on a branch just above him.<br/>"Ucchan," he said, holding up his hand in greeting.<p>Ukyo (or "Ucchan" as many people preferred), folded her arms<br/>and glared down at Ranma in irritation. "What's this I hear<br/>about you dating other girls! You have a fiancee,<br/>remember? Me!"<p>"What'sa?" Ranma started, then said, "Dating?"<p>"You've been acting really strange, lately, Ranchan," she<br/>said (using his boyhood nickname that she sometimes<br/>preferred). "What's this all about?"<p>Ukyo was always straight-to-the-point, and Ranma realized<br/>that he would get nowhere with her unless he was completely<br/>honest. "I wish I knew," he said.<p>"Well," Ukyo said, giving him a nasty sideways glance, "I<br/>can let it slide, for now. If I catch you, you'll have some<br/>explaining to do. Don't think I won't."<p>Ukyo leaped from the tree and deftly landed as Ranma said,<br/>"Sometimes it's good to be alive-"<p>Just then, a shoe hit him in the head, and he was just<br/>starting to wonder who threw it when he heard Akane's<br/>disembodied voice saying, "I am *not* jealous!"<p>Ranma smiled. It was a good pain, all-in-all. Ranma knew<br/>what the score was, and the way he saw it, he was way ahead<br/>on points alone. He had no idea why, but he was winning.<br/>He wondered if maybe being multiple-personality was<br/>attractive to girls.<p>Akane, who had been engaged against her will by her father<br/>(and her sisters) to Ranma, was at least as relieved as she<br/>was annoyed by this situation. If Ranma was interested in<br/>others, then it would leave her free to be with whoever she<br/>chose. Of course, she might never admit it, but she would<br/>choose Ranma-in spite of him being a total jerk.<p>Ranma, for his part, expected Akane to choose him-and that<br/>was the end of the matter, as far as he was concerned.<p>Never mind the fact that Ranma's father had promised him<br/>long ago to another girl-named Ukyo. Once Ranma had<br/>confessed the fact that Ukyo was attractive (an easy<br/>confession for him), there was no doubt in Ukyo's mind that<br/>Ranma would eventually be married to her.<p>Ranma knew quite well what Ukyo thought and had many times<br/>encouraged her to continue thinking this way (which should<br/>help explain some of Akane's attitude toward him).<p>He began laughing and noticed Tatewaki Kuno strolling by.<br/>Kuno seemed to be slightly more perturbed than usual, as<br/>Ranma appeared and landed-squatting in his usual way on top<br/>of Kuno's head, continuing to laugh as he did so.<p>Kuno merely rolled his eyes and said, "Ah, Ranma. Just the<br/>villain I was searching for."<p>"Yo, Kuno," Ranma said.<p>Kuno immediately produced a wooden practice sword and drove<br/>it toward where Ranma had been squatting a moment ago.<br/>Ranma neatly leaped over it, doing a split. Then, as Kuno<br/>continued stabbing and slashing at Ranma, Ranma nimbly<br/>dodged and ducked each time. "How's it hangin' Kuno?" Ranma<br/>asked, very calm and casual.<p>"How dare you!" Kuno spat, continuing to slash at Ranma.<br/>"Attempting to toy with my beloved Akane in this fashion is<br/>simply unforgivable! Ranma, you will pay!"<p>Ranma realized that his laughter was what had probably set<br/>off Kuno, but this did not hinder him from laughing once<br/>again, as he continued to easily dodge and duck the blade of<br/>Kuno. He then suddenly realized how familiar all of this<br/>was-and in a way that seemed very alien to him. Suddenly,<br/>he saw some of the faces of the girls who were watching and<br/>recognized the look of stunned amazement on their faces.<p>He began to think that this situation was far too familiar<br/>to them, in particular, and that if this were to continue<br/>much longer, they would only grow annoyed at both of them.<br/>These same girls had started to become familiar with Ranma's<br/>"manliness," and would be all the more disappointed and<br/>disgusted with him.<p>Now all this merely took a moment for Ranma to realize, so<br/>it was no problem for him to leap over Kuno and restrain him<br/>from behind-forcing him to release his weapon. Some of<br/>those who witnessed this event said later that Ranma had<br/>"teleported" behind Kuno, but Ranma was simply very fast.<p>"Whoa, there!" Ranma said. "Watch where you're stickin'<br/>that thing! You could really hurt somebody!"<p>"Wha-!" Kuno floundered, as Ranma released him, a moment<br/>later.<p>"If you wanna play," Ranma heard himself saying, "you gotta<br/>learn to be a little nicer. All right? No flingin' that<br/>stick around anymore."<p>Kuno was off-balance by this kind of attack-usually being<br/>the one making demands of Ranma from his usual position of<br/>authority. Kuno had expected Ranma to be angry or petulant,<br/>but this was totally different. "Now, look!" Kuno said, a<br/>little hesitantly. "I am not to be spoken to in this<br/>manner! I am your elder!"<p>Ranma seemed outside himself as he turned a look of such<br/>patronizing amusement to Kuno that Kuno flinched in shock.<br/>Ranma then turned and left the school grounds, as Kuno<br/>trembled in amazed humiliation.<p>Many of the girls-who had not quite seen how Ranma had<br/>looked at Kuno, but were only amazed at Kuno's shock-<br/>nearly swooned in delight at Ranma's stunt and trampled over<br/>Kuno in chasing after Ranma (just as Kuno was beginning to<br/>get his composure back).<p>Ranma, by now, had snuck away to the safety of his fence<br/>tops-where he continued strolling, as usual, just as if he<br/>were merely walking down the sidewalk.<p>***<p>"I'm sorry," Ranma said. His casual manner made it clear to<br/>Akane, however, that he felt she had been making a bigger<br/>deal out of it (whatever it was) than it was worth.<p>Akane waited a moment, half expecting Ranma to continue,<br/>then said, "Fine. But you should have said something,<br/>earlier."<p>Ranma sighed, lowered his gaze and turned to leave.<p>Akane was about to add something when Nabiki appeared at her<br/>doorway and bumped into Ranma. "Oops!" Nabiki said, just as<br/>Ranma looked up and said, "Excuse me!"<p>Ranma then quickly and smoothly navigated his way around and<br/>down the hallway, disappearing down the stairs.<p>Akane slowly digested what had happened as Nabiki took<br/>another look and then disappeared briefly into her own room.<p>Ranma had apologized, and sincerely. In spite of this, and<br/>the fact that Akane knew it had been sincere, she still felt<br/>angry that Ranma had apologized in such a casual way. She<br/>had even forgotten what it was he had apologized for in the<br/>first place, but that wasn't the issue.<p>Akane growled and groaned, wishing she could rip Ranma limb<br/>from limb. Then she realized that she was getting angry at<br/>Ranma over something she couldn't even remember, and that<br/>made her even more angry. Then she saw herself in the<br/>mirror, and the grotesque mask that she assumed was her face<br/>made her even more angry.<p>"Dammit!" she swore, pounding her own innocent head with her<br/>fist, then stopped as she started to see stars.<p>More than ever, she felt that she had somehow wronged Ranma,<br/>and that she needed to say something encouraging to him.<br/>She nevertheless was convinced that it was still all Ranma's<br/>fault and that someone should give Ranma a thorough beating<br/>for it. Exhausted with the contradictions in her emotions,<br/>she sat at the edge of her bed, just as Nabiki appeared at<br/>her door.<p>"You see what I mean?" Nabiki asked, not bothering to<br/>preface her question with a topic.<p>"I don't understand anything, anymore," Akane muttered. "Is<br/>it wrong for me to still hate that jerk, even after he<br/>apologized like that?"<p>"Huh?" said Nabiki.<p>Akane found herself inexplicably crying again-her usual<br/>reaction to strange, conflicting emotions-and she wiped<br/>away a few tears. "Is Ranma a better person than me?<br/>Should I hate myself more than Ranma?"<p>"Ranma apologized?" Nabiki asked, still a little stunned<br/>from Akane's earlier revelation. "To you?"<p>Akane suddenly found herself imagining that Ranma was<br/>nothing more than a bloody mess in an alley, somewhere, and<br/>she had been the one who had hacked him up. Akane trembled<br/>and gusted with sobs.<p>Nabiki, hardly bothering to notice Akane, absently told<br/>herself, "Now, that is a little hard to believe. I<br/>wonder..."<p>As Nabiki wandered off, Akane tried to set her mind at ease,<br/>but the only thing she could think of was how strange this<br/>situation was and how she couldn't stop herself from crying,<br/>no matter how she tried.<p>It was just about then that P-chan entered-Ryoga in the<br/>form of a small pig, actually-and tried to absorb this.<p>For several minutes, all he could do was stare in wonder at<br/>Akane and think of how useless he was. No matter how he<br/>prodded her with his snout or whether he sat in her lap or<br/>even danced a little piggy dance, Akane ignored him-her<br/>face buried in her hands.<p>Just as Ryoga was thinking it was hopeless and started to<br/>walk away, Akane spoke up.<p>"P-chan, just go away. Leave me alone."<p>She emphasized her words by kicking him out the door and<br/>slamming it shut.<p>Even as his heart had sunk and he had been stalking away,<br/>some corner of his mind had held onto the hope that Akane<br/>would change her mind and comfort herself with picking him<br/>up and petting him. It was an indignity to him, but his<br/>honor could not bear to see her in such distress.<p>Now he simply felt as though nothing in the world could<br/>possibly be worse than his own state of being. If there was<br/>a hell, he began to think that he was now truly in it.<p>***<p>Genma was disappointed with Ranma.<p>Ranma usually gave Genma a good workout, and frankly, Ranma<br/>was usually far too much for Genma to handle.<p>Today, Ranma was leaving openings left and right, and<br/>getting knocked down to the dojo floor over and over and<br/>over... It was getting downright embarrassing.<p>Even worse still, Ranma's attitude had become dull and<br/>careless. To be sure, Ranma sometimes had a habit of<br/>becoming obtuse and carefree, but that was different.<br/>Subtle, but different.<p>Always, there had been a subtle sharpness to his attitude.<br/>Now, it seemed that edge was gone. Genma was at his wit's<br/>end.<p>"Ranma!" he barked. "Fight back, dammit!"<p>"Yeah, yeah..." Ranma answered. He got up for a moment,<br/>only to immediately be knocked to the floor again by a well-<br/>placed kick from his father.<p>Ranma again slowly got up, checking his wrist for his pulse<br/>and deliberately slowing his breath and heart rate.<p>Genma scowled to himself, unable to recognize that habit in<br/>Ranma. In fact, Genma had never encouraged any particular<br/>habit in Ranma. So, to see Ranma checking his energy and<br/>making the most efficient use of his motions was disturbing.<p>Ranma smiled and lazily said, "You're no fun today, Pop."<p>Genma was a little shocked at this statement, and Ranma<br/>could have easily attacked Genma at several angles in that<br/>moment. Instead, Ranma slowly took a towel and wiped a bit<br/>of sweat from his forehead.<p>"Are we done?" he asked.<p>Genma wanted to swat Ranma down to the floor again, but he<br/>was worn out. Without Genma realizing it, Ranma had<br/>defeated him in the simplest way Genma could be defeated-by<br/>taking advantage of Genma being out of shape. Genma smiled<br/>as he recognized it.<p>"I see this new personality has made you adjust your<br/>tactics, Ranma," he said. "But using your face to bruise<br/>someone's fist is a stupid way to fight."<p>"Yeah, yeah..." Ranma said, standing proudly in a way that<br/>Genma couldn't recall before.<p>Just then, the door slid open and Ryoga appeared-fire in<br/>his eyes and steam drifting from his head (suggesting that<br/>he had just doused himself with hot water to change back<br/>from being a pig). "Ranma!" Ryoga said, clenching his fist<br/>in baleful anger.<p>"Now, this looks interesting," Ranma commented.<p>Ryoga unceremoniously charged straight at Ranma, apparently<br/>intending to kill Ranma with one sharp punch to the head.<br/>Ranma was on his guard, however, and Genma was relieved for<br/>the moment that Ranma seemed back to his usual self.<p>Ranma leaped and dodged and ducked until forcing Ryoga to<br/>overextend himself-making him vulnerable to a sharp kick<br/>from Ranma that sent Ryoga right through the floorboards<br/>into the ground below the dojo.<p>"Damn, Ryoga," said Ranma, somewhat playfully. "I'm<br/>starting to think you mean it, this time."<p>Ryoga returned with fury in his eyes, and carefully observed<br/>Ranma's every move with an intensity that was almost<br/>scorching.<p>Genma suddenly wanted to call out to Ranma to be careful,<br/>but Genma knew that he didn't dare break Ranma's<br/>concentration. Ryoga seriously looked as if he wanted to<br/>murder Ranma, this time.<p>The first punch Ryoga threw nearly ended Ranma right there,<br/>but Ranma was just fast enough to only suffer a nasty<br/>scratch-and to realize just how deadly serious Ryoga was.<br/>Ranma took a taste of his own blood and locked his<br/>concentration completely on Ryoga, then.<p>What then happened was a blur of punches and kicks, followed<br/>by several moments of the two just standing, eying each<br/>other's movements. For what seemed like an hour, the fight<br/>continued until at last Ryoga found the break in Ranma's<br/>concentration that he was looking for, and smashed his fist<br/>into Ranma's face, knocking him cold to the floor.<p>Ryoga was about to continue pounding Ranma when Akane<br/>appeared, pleading with him to stop.<p>"Stop it, stop it, stop it!" she was yelling.<p>Ryoga had been so lost in the haze of his anger that he<br/>hadn't noticed all the new observers. He looked around and<br/>noticed Genma for the first time, and Soun Tendo, Kasumi,<br/>Nabiki... His head began to swim.<p>"Akane," he started, but Akane pushed him out of the way and<br/>hovered over Ranma, checking him.<p>Ranma was okay, of course. The beating he had taken from<br/>Ryoga was nothing compared to some of the beatings Akane had<br/>given him in the past. Still, it had given Akane a scare,<br/>and it drove home to Ryoga the fact that no matter whether<br/>Akane liked P-chan, she would never like Ryoga-never mind<br/>love him the way that he loved her.<p>As Ryoga ran away, he began to think that Akane probably<br/>didn't even like P-chan anymore, either.<p>Standing next to this scene, Soun began to rub his chin and<br/>then remarked, "Say, Saotome. Is it just me, or is Ranma<br/>somehow... different?"<p>"Hmm..." Genma replied. "Perhaps..."<p>***<p>So now, without having ever heard that old Amazon saying,<br/>the others in Ranma's life were all, nevertheless, aware<br/>that Ranma truly only possessed about half his own mind.<br/>The other half was as mysterious as the body he changed into<br/>whenever splashed with cold water.<p>The odd thing was, however, that no one had tested his<br/>mysterious condition until a few days later.<p>It had happened in much the same way that it always seemed<br/>to happen. Ranma was returning home from school when a<br/>sudden downpour burst from the sky, flinging cold water<br/>every which way the wind blew. Ranma, as usual, groaned and<br/>used his books as a makeshift umbrella till finding himself<br/>under the relative shelter of a shop front.<p>Akane had been nagging him the whole way about something,<br/>but Ranma brushed it off until finding shelter.<p>"But Ranma," Akane insisted. "You-"<p>"Ooo!" Ranma exclaimed, noticing that they were standing in<br/>front of an ice cream stand. "Gotta get some! Gotta get<br/>some!"<p>Akane sighed deeply and folded her arms in the usual<br/>irritated way, as Ranma bounced excitedly while ordering<br/>some ice cream. The man served him up a cone and then<br/>monotonously added the amount that it would cost.<p>Ranma was a bit taken aback by this additional statement,<br/>and he attempted for a brief moment to use puppy-dog eyes to<br/>get out of having to pay, but it apparently wasn't going to<br/>work, this time.<p>Normally (in girl form), Ranma would either get treats for<br/>free or he could nearly always count on someone else to buy<br/>treats for him. He assumed that it wasn't working because<br/>Akane was standing nearby, thereby cutting back on his<br/>cuteness-which was odd, since he just assumed it would work<br/>the other way around. Akane would never give Ranma even<br/>one yen, so Ranma forked over some of his own spare change<br/>and moved on to the next shop.<p>The next shop over was a beef bowl place, and some rather<br/>rude young men pushed and shoved Ranma out of the way<br/>without so much as an apology. This struck Ranma as very<br/>odd, and he become annoyed at trying to figure out why<br/>people were treating him so strangely. He became even more<br/>annoyed when Akane again interrupted his train of thought.<p>"Well, what do you expect?" Akane said. "You're still a g-"<p>"Shut up, Akane!" he said, scratching his head. "I'm tryin'<br/>to think."<p>"Fine!" Akane answered.<p>"That's better," Ranma added, looking around for something<br/>familiar. He glanced across the street and happened to<br/>notice a local dress shop. He then dashed across the<br/>street, immediately going inside.<p>Akane was stunned with shock, then suddenly had a moment of<br/>insight. Akane realized that the normal thing for Ranma to<br/>do would be to assume that because he was still dressed as a<br/>guy, that people would naturally treat him like a guy-so,<br/>the obvious solution would be to change into women's<br/>clothing.<p>Akane was about to chase after him, but then thought better<br/>of it and just casually crossed the street-a devious smirk<br/>suddenly appearing on her face.<p>Sure enough, when Akane entered the shop, Ranma had already<br/>changed into an adorable dress and was posing without having<br/>really *looked* at any of the many mirrors in the shop.<p>Naturally, there were several young women standing around-<br/>all terribly engrossed by this new attraction. It took a<br/>few moments for Ranma to realize that they were all staring<br/>at him in horror and amazement.<p>Ranma had a long, sickening moment to slowly realize several<br/>things all at once:<p>"Oh, crap!" he thought. "Am I actually still a guy?"<p>"Wait!" he thought. "I just came out of the pouring rain!<br/>How could I still be guy?"<p>"Geez!" he thought. "Why are these girls looking at me like<br/>that? If I'm a guy, I must look like a total *pervert!*"<p>Ranma slowly turned to take a good look at a nearby mirror,<br/>and he flinched in shock when he saw himself. He was,<br/>indeed, a guy. For a moment, he had an overwhelming urge to<br/>leap for joy that he hadn't changed into a girl for once in<br/>a long time, and the next moment he had an overwhelming urge<br/>to hide himself under a rock somewhere.<p>He became stunned with embarrassment, however, when several<br/>of the girls started giggling uncontrollably. Several of<br/>the other girls started throwing things at him, yelling,<br/>kicking and screaming, as Akane rolled her eyes and<br/>muttered, "Idiot."<p>***<p>At supper, later that evening, Akane recounted the story in<br/>loving detail to a delighted Nabiki and somewhat mortified<br/>Kasumi and Soun. Genma was mildly amused, but he also<br/>seemed a little wary. Genma then at once threw cold water<br/>on Ranma, and proclaimed:<p>"Well, I'll be! You really are cured!"<p>Ranma looked up, briefly annoyed, then turned back to his<br/>food very casually.<p>Akane, who had been watching Ranma's reaction, was even more<br/>intrigued. She had seen Ranma retaliate over much less than<br/>this, and she knew that Ranma could never hide his anger<br/>this well.<p>Nabiki, who was already well ahead of Akane, suggested, "I<br/>wonder what else Ranma is cured of."<p>A moment later, Genma returned with a cat and tossed it on<br/>top of Ranma's head. The cat clung to Ranma's face for<br/>another moment, as Ranma sighed. He then removed the cat<br/>from his face and calmed it-gently petting it and speaking<br/>to it in a soothing manner. In no time at all, the cat<br/>curled up in Ranma's lap, and Ranma continued eating his<br/>soggy rice.<p>For the next hour or so, the others had returned with dozens<br/>of cats-just to make certain that this wasn't a fluke.<br/>Eventually, they were forced to admit that Ranma had indeed<br/>been cured of more than one ailment, even if he was still an<br/>idiot.<p>Akane-who had seen Ranma pick up Shampoo the cat one<br/>moment, then toss her away in terror the next moment-was a<br/>little skeptical about the "cure" part of the equation, but<br/>she had to admit that she was impressed with his endurance.<p>Later that evening, Ranma impressed them all with his sudden<br/>understanding of the Chinese language. Akane-who had taken<br/>up Chinese several years ago as a hobby-tested Ranma on his<br/>ability to use proper grammar, and Ranma tested her on<br/>proper pronunciation.<p>For an hour or so, Ranma and Akane did nothing but test each<br/>other's Chinese ability-each one thought they had the upper<br/>hand, in spite of Ranma's inexplicable fluency.<p>For Genma and Soun, it was refreshing to see Akane and Ranma<br/>communicating so well with each other, but it was irritating<br/>that they couldn't understand a word of it.<p>Ranma and Akane seemed to be in a heated argument (over the<br/>proper usage of a particular group of symbols), so Soun and<br/>Genma went out to the backyard porch to unwind with a little<br/>shogi.<p>Akane and Ranma were starting to growl, and the look of<br/>playful intensity on Ranma's face made Akane start to break<br/>up and laugh.<p>"Laugh it up, huh?" Ranma said (in Chinese).<p>"You should see your face!" Akane said (also in Chinese).<p>It then seemed to occur to them that they could hold an<br/>entire conversation without fear of the others overhearing a<br/>word, and Ranma said, "I'm really worried."<p>Akane, noticing the serious tone, suddenly became serious<br/>and said, "You are?"<p>"Yeah," Ranma said.<p>Akane frowned for a moment, then beamed, saying, "Wow!<br/>That's so great!" When Ranma looked a little annoyed, Akane<br/>added, "I mean, it's great that you admit it. Normally you<br/>never tell me anything, Ranma."<p>"Yeah," Ranma said.<p>"So?" Akane asked. "What are you worried about? You've<br/>gotten cured, haven't you?"<p>Ranma then said something that even Akane couldn't<br/>translate, and added, "But it's not the same, you know?"<p>Now normally, Akane would protest her ignorance, but she<br/>found herself agreeing with Ranma. Something in Ranma's<br/>manner suggested to her that Ranma needed her to understand,<br/>and that asking stupid questions would just cause him to<br/>worry more-or worse, begin to lose patience with her.<p>"I'm so glad, Akane," he said. "I know I can trust you."<p>Akane agreed again, knowing that the missing thing to which<br/>she was agreeing was vital, and also knowing that not<br/>knowing could possibly cause serious harm, but agreeing all<br/>the same.<p>"Don't tell anyone else," Ranma added.<p>"I won't," Akane said, and she could hardly be more honest<br/>about that.<p>Of course, without having realized it-because it wasn't his<br/>normal personality, or because this personality did such<br/>things habitually-Ranma had used an obscure idiom to relate<br/>the idea of his having two distinct people in one mind.<br/>Akane merely assumed that Ranma was referring to some change<br/>in his attitude (the theory that she was operating under),<br/>and that that was the end of the matter.<p>So, when Ranma said, "I don't know if it's really me, or<br/>whether anyone else would be able to understand-" Akane<br/>just assumed that he was speaking metaphorically.<p>***<p>And just at that moment, Genma hit his hand in realization,<br/>got up from the game he was playing with Soun, and threw a<br/>cold bucket of water on himself, explaining that, "The curse<br/>has probably just run its course!"<p>A moment later, he was in panda-form. He held up a sign,<br/>saying, "Or maybe not..."<p>***<p>What later occurred between Ranma and the others was mostly<br/>in keeping with this pattern. Ranma showed some part of his<br/>normal personality, found himself involved in one silly and<br/>dangerous situation after another as a result-often with<br/>humorous effects, when judging from a point of view other<br/>than Ranma's-and generally made himself a nuisance until<br/>someone punished him for not showing more of his new-and-<br/>improved personality.<p>Whenever someone would ask Akane about it much later, she<br/>would sigh and explain that Ranma simply had a knack for<br/>getting into trouble. It spared her the task of explaining<br/>how Ranma would encounter Happosai or Cologne or any number<br/>of other improbable people and wind up battling through some<br/>mock-heroic scenarios.<p>But for all of Ranma's adventures, he never encountered<br/>Ryoga-the guy he considered his main rival. Ryoga had run<br/>away for the last time, it seemed.<p>Ryoga had always been the anchor in Ranma's stormy seas of<br/>Akane's angst, and Ranma had always depended on Ryoga's<br/>stern and serious attitude to help guide Ranma away from the<br/>more fantastic stunts of stupidity Ranma sometimes found<br/>himself in.<p>Ranma knew that only Ukyo would sympathize with him, but<br/>Ukyo was the last person Ranma wanted to see.<p>Deep in his heart, Ranma felt that he was betraying himself<br/>in some vague way, and he could not bear to have Ukyo's<br/>emotional support. Ukyo had been untainted by the stink of<br/>any real curse, and he wanted her to remain that way.<p>Ukyo would no doubt have some rapport with his new<br/>personality, and she would delve into it until involving<br/>herself or maybe even losing herself in it. Ranma didn't<br/>trust it, though, and he was fairly certain it had something<br/>to do with his curse-which was not to say that he hated<br/>this new personality.<p>Sometimes-when dueling with pastry monsters, or fending off<br/>panty raids, or even just the usual domestic disturbance<br/>battles-he found himself feeling as if his heart was going<br/>to burst with pride, and that his picture of himself had<br/>seemed a lot darker and blurred than this new one. It was<br/>inevitably in these moments that he started to understand<br/>why this strange personality seemed so magnetic to other<br/>people. People simply wanted to share in that warmth he<br/>felt toward himself.<p>It was a burden, too, because he began to feel more than<br/>ever now that the one person he wanted to show off this<br/>personality to was Ryoga. He had already outshone Miss<br/>Hinako-his English teacher-several times, and although it<br/>was very satisfying to put the charming half-girl, half-<br/>adult in her place, he just didn't feel the satisfaction of<br/>having outshone someone as grim and serious as Ryoga.<p>Somewhere between the third or fourth pickle at dinner, he<br/>was just beginning to think that he should confront Kuno<br/>again-for the sport of it, of course-when Akane broke his<br/>concentration and announced that Ryoga was getting married.<p>"Say what?" Ranma asked.<p>"It's true," Akane answered, holding out a letter to Ranma.<p>"Gimme that," Ranma said, and immediately read through it.<p>It seemed at long last, Ryoga was going to tie the knot with<br/>Akari-a girl he'd met some time ago that had had a strange<br/>fascination with pigs and had fallen deeply in love with him.<p>Ranma took brief amusement out of the last line, "The<br/>wedding will be held some time in the month of May."<p>"That's Ryoga, all right," Ranma said, a measure of relief<br/>in his voice. "I wonder if he can keep to that narrow a<br/>schedule."<p>Akane smiled for a moment, then frowned and said, "Are you<br/>okay with this?"<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"I mean," Akane said, clearing her throat, "after everything<br/>that happened last time."<p>"Well," Ranma instantly replied in a very casual tone that<br/>told Akane he was drifting into his alternate personality<br/>again, "he is my best friend and rival. You'd have a hard<br/>time tryin' to keep me away."<p>Ranma looked at Akane seriously for a moment-which annoyed<br/>Akane. She could never tell what he was thinking, even<br/>before he developed a split-personality. Now, it was just<br/>daunting to her to see Ranma stare at her like that. "What?"<br/>Akane finally said.<p>"It's gotta be a little hard for you, though," Ranma said.<br/>"He really looked up to you, after all."<p>Akane grimaced and said, "You think I should apologize?"<p>"Your choice," Ranma replied. "If it were me, though, I'd<br/>play one last little prank on him, for old time's sake."<p>"You would," Akane said, looking a little reproachful.<br/>Ranma was just about to explain what he meant when Akane<br/>took the letter back, saying, "Don't bother."<p>***<p>It was deeply disappointing to Ranma that Akane wouldn't go<br/>along with his gag, because Akane would naturally be the<br/>centerpiece of a perfect practical joke on Ryoga. Ryoga<br/>would hardly notice something as banal as a rip in his<br/>tuxedo pants or slipping on a banana peel, and changing him<br/>into P-chan during the ceremony would probably be going a<br/>bit too far. Letting him think for a moment that he had a<br/>real shot at Akane would probably be just enough for a real<br/>laugh without getting him into *too* much trouble.<p>He, instead, contented himself with knowing that Ryoga<br/>wasn't committing suicide or doing some outrageous training<br/>to upstage him, anymore. Ryoga wasn't about to become an<br/>irresponsible jerk like Ranma, so Ryoga would think of his<br/>family from now on.<p>All the same, Ranma was starting to think fondly of his old<br/>battles with Ryoga, and he more than once caught himself<br/>thinking about going out to find Ryoga just so they could<br/>spar with each other one more time.<p>It was difficult, but he found that this stranger within him<br/>understood quite well how to cope with this situation.<br/>There would always be newer and better rivals. Whatever the<br/>change in the battlefield or the contestants, the pride he<br/>would feel would never change. For all his vaunted<br/>strength, Ryoga could never truly match Ranma in speed nor<br/>adaptability. Ryoga would only, ultimately, hold him back<br/>from being able to face a real challenge.<p>When it came time to go to the chapel-and they had to<br/>hurry, because they had been waiting some time for Ryoga to<br/>show up-the others were impressed by Ranma's maturity.<p>Nothing out of the ordinary happened at the ceremony, and<br/>the priest even remarked that he'd never seen a marriage go<br/>so smoothly.<p>Afterward, Ranma and Ryoga had embraced each other in mutual<br/>friendship, wishing each other genuinely the best of luck.<br/>For Soun Tendo, it was a day of great sadness and joy-to<br/>think that he could witness such an event, even if it wasn't<br/>for one of his own daughters. For Genma Saotome, it was an<br/>annoying waste of time that he had been sincerely hoping<br/>would be ruined somehow by Ranma. For Akane and her<br/>sisters, it was like a moment of surreal fantasy that they<br/>thought they would wake up from at any moment.<p>When they returned to the Tendo household, Ranma could not<br/>shake the feeling that he was to be next to go through this<br/>merry-go-round of formalities and uncomfortable clothes, and<br/>it stunned him into grim silence.<p>As a matter of fact, it would mean absolutely nothing for<br/>Ranma to have a wedding ceremony-he was simply not old<br/>enough to be legally married, so any marriage would be<br/>strictly for show. Ryoga, however, was in the same<br/>situation, and it didn't matter. Ryoga could not reasonably<br/>expect to date anyone after this, and that made all the<br/>difference in the world-though he had never *really* dated<br/>anyone other than Akari.<p>It was acutely obvious to everyone else what Ranma was going<br/>through-especially to Akane, the one to whom he would be<br/>wed-so they steered well clear of Ranma and his brooding.<p>In fact, they had steered so far around him that no one<br/>noticed that-somewhere between the wedding chapel and the<br/>Tendo home-he had somehow changed to girl-form.<br/>
