</div><p>Part 3: Straight From the Horse's Mouth<p>So, now the mystery of how Ranma and Akane had felt seemed<br/>to be laid to rest, and it seemed to Soun Tendo and Genma<br/>Saotome that it would be best for them to leave Ranma and<br/>Akane alone-allowing their children to sort out whatever<br/>differences may have remained.<p>There certainly didn't appear to be anything out of the<br/>ordinary to their parents, and whatever wasn't ideal would<br/>surely never stand in the way of their impending marriage<br/>plans.<p>Nevertheless, Soun and Genma continued to pester Ranma and<br/>Akane every moment of every day that they could-asking them<br/>about how things were going, remarking on how nice it was<br/>that they were getting along, telling them that it was good<br/>for them to be totally honest with each other, etc.<p>Thus, it was no real surprise to anyone that Akane began to<br/>avoid her father. The real shock was that Ranma not only<br/>withstood the constant annoyances, but he even encouraged<br/>them to the point of making them weary of his enthusiasm.<p>Ranma had always prided himself on his friendliness. What<br/>was odd were the number of people who now agreed with him.<p>The mystery of how Ranma came to have changed so much was<br/>also a favorite topic for conversation. Some said that<br/>Ranma looked different in some subtle way. Some said that<br/>Akane had finally pounded some sense into Ranma. Some even<br/>said that Shampoo had used another magical charm on Ranma.<p>Along with stories of Ranma's new personality, Ranma also<br/>encouraged people to think that he was peacefully content<br/>with his engagement to Akane, and that nothing in the world<br/>would ever change his mind about marrying her one day.<p>A few people he spoke to would smile delightedly and<br/>compliment him on his new-found resolve and excellent taste<br/>in women-Akane had always been admired among Ranma's<br/>classmates. Most other people, however, would smile<br/>humoringly-thinking that Ranma was surely up to something<br/>devious. Among the students of Furinkan high school, rumors<br/>began to spread again about Ranma seeing a girl or two on<br/>the side.<p>Tatewaki Kuno-a long time devotee of Akane-despised the<br/>rumors (because he viewed them as an insult to Akane), but<br/>came to find himself starting to believe them, anyway.<br/>Whenever Kuno confronted Ranma, however, he found himself<br/>unable to show anger toward Ranma.<p>What was even more disturbing to Kuno was that he began to<br/>feel himself strangely drawn to Ranma. Kuno had always<br/>despised the thought of being affectionate with men, and he<br/>therefore began to engage in a healthy dose of "discipline"<br/>(which his sister began to affectionately refer to as<br/>"masochism training").<p>Kodachi, who had always taken delight in seeing Ranma, was<br/>now thrilled whenever she spoke with Ranma. Ranma had<br/>always seemed a little shy to her before, and now he seemed<br/>very relaxed and matter-of-fact. Kodachi spent a few days<br/>recovering from her happiness at Ranma's transformation.<p>There was one particular afternoon when Tatewaki Kuno's<br/>irritation at himself began to overflow so much that he<br/>actually found Ranma and lashed out at him.<p>Ranma had been strolling toward the entrance of the school<br/>grounds, hardly seeming to have a care in the world, as Kuno<br/>approached and cut off Ranma's path with his practice sword.<p>"Where do you think you're going?" Kuno growled.<p>Ranma took a moment to look around and casually said,<br/>"Home."<p>"To Akane's home, you mean!" Kuno accused him.<p>"Right," Ranma agreed. "That's where I live." Ranma looked<br/>at the sword and back at Kuno and asked, "Do you mind?"<p>"I think not!" Kuno said, keeping his brandished sword fixed<br/>in Ranma's path. "I cannot allow this fiendish situation to<br/>continue!"<p>"Huh?"<p>"You think you can seduce the fair, pure-hearted Akane with<br/>nothing more than your presence and some ridiculous charade<br/>of pretending to be a man! I urge you to think again!"<p>"Seduce? Who said anything about seducing?"<p>"I did!" Kuno insisted, getting in Ranma's face. Kuno<br/>lowered his sword and said, "You think Akane is charmed by<br/>all this show of nonchalant strutting? It will avail you<br/>nothing! I shall tear away that mask-!"<p>Ranma started to casually walk away.<p>"I wasn't finished!" Kuno blared.<p>"We can talk on the way," Ranma said, gesturing his offer.<p>Kuno stepped in front of Ranma and waved his hand at Ranma-<br/>warding him from going any further. "We have nothing to<br/>discuss, and furthermore we-!"<p>"Okay," Ranma said, casually walking away again.<p>"I'm talkin' here!" Kuno exclaimed.<p>If Ranma reacted, he showed no sign of it, but simply waved<br/>to a few friends as he left the school grounds.<p>Kuno was never more upset, but the thought of having to<br/>speak to Ranma bothered him so much that he screamed, "Curse<br/>you, Ranma! You are not a man! I don't care what I have to<br/>do, but I shall prove it!"<p>Some girls who happened to be walking by began giggling, and<br/>Kuno wondered what it meant until hearing a rumor the next<br/>day that he was desperate to see Ranma naked.<p>***<p>Akane, who had once seen Ranma naked, was only desperate to<br/>recover her dignity and make her room the spotless shrine to<br/>neatness it had once been. And now that she had found<br/>something like karmic release, she found herself becoming<br/>even more of a neat freak than ever.<p>She was also slightly annoyed that merely chopping wood with<br/>her hands had not kept her in shape, and she was now jogging<br/>three times a day.<p>In school, people noticed that she pushed herself a little<br/>harder at physical education than usual, yet she always<br/>seemed strangely calm and relaxed. This, naturally, lead to<br/>a few rather annoying rumors that she and Ranma were<br/>sleeping together.<p>Akane would furiously deny any such rumors while secretly<br/>wishing Ranma would sleep with her, then would suddenly spot<br/>him and become embarrassed at her own thoughts-which<br/>invariably made her focus harder on training.<p>Ranma, himself, wasn't embarrassed about Akane anymore, and<br/>he found it strange that he once thought of Akane as uncute.<br/>It was a little disorienting, but he began to think of Akane<br/>as a calm and gentle person with a very big heart.<p>And Ranma avoided intimate contact with her because he was<br/>reluctant to shatter this image of her that had suddenly<br/>appeared in his mind. All he knew was that it made Akane<br/>seem extremely attractive to him, and he wanted to preserve<br/>her that way as long as humanly possible.<p>***<p>Another extremely attractive girl, Ukyo, began noticing all<br/>this odd behavior in Ranma. Ukyo was grimly amused at the<br/>bovine stupidity girls displayed whenever discussing Ranma,<br/>and terribly curious to hear Nabiki's reaction. Nabiki had<br/>always proved somewhat insightful, but her reticence had<br/>become more pronounced, lately. Ukyo didn't know what to<br/>make of it, but she was determined to find out.<p>Ukyo, like Nabiki, was also not above using a little<br/>dishonesty.<p>***<p>Late one day, Akane was helping Kasumi in the kitchen and<br/>becoming particularly frustrated at her lack of success.<br/>Kasumi had started out convinced that she could show Akane<br/>that all that was required was a little more practice, and<br/>to compare the art of cooking with many of the martial arts<br/>disciplines she noticed Akane had mastered. Instead, Kasumi<br/>was stunned at having to witness time after time how Akane<br/>was simply unable to do the most basic things-like tasting<br/>the food, making sure you follow the heating and timing<br/>instructions, and using just the right amounts of the right<br/>ingredients.<p>Kasumi actually became very irritated, and it took her a<br/>great effort of will to merely escort Akane from the kitchen<br/>without slapping her.<p>An hour later than she had intended, Kasumi had finished<br/>cooking. Fortunately, she had left herself an hour to<br/>spare, and so there was no time to waste on giving Akane<br/>unnecessary warnings and making sure that Akane would be on<br/>her toes.<p>The important part-making sure the food was hot and ready-<br/>had been completed, so Kasumi breathed a huge sigh of<br/>relief. She then grabbed her luggage and immediately left,<br/>waving goodbye to Akane as she went out the entrance.<p>***<p>Ranma had become lost in doing schoolwork and in pondering<br/>the great mystery of what hairstyle made him look best, when<br/>he realized that he was hungry.<p>When he arrived at dinner, he was surprised to notice that<br/>he was alone with Akane, and he was shocked to discover that<br/>although Akane was serving him food, it was food he could<br/>reasonably expect to survive eating. In fact, the food was<br/>so good that he immediately realized that Kasumi was the<br/>only one who could have made it.<p>Ranma was also relieved to discover that there was still one<br/>thing that terrified him beyond reason-the prospect having<br/>to consume one of Akane's meals. Instead of saying so,<br/>however, Ranma only smiled and thanked Akane.<p>"Actually," Akane admitted with a blush, "Kasumi is the one<br/>who made this."<p>"Oh," Ranma said, trying hard not to show that he already<br/>knew. "Is Kasumi here?"<p>Akane cleared her throat and said, "Well, actually, I did<br/>help a little bit with the food."<p>"Is Kasumi here?" Ranma asked again in the same friendly<br/>tone of voice.<p>"Well," Akane said, sighing, "the truth is, I don't think<br/>Kasumi actually used any of what I cooked..."<p>"So..." Ranma said, then after a pause, asked, "Is Kasumi<br/>here?"<p>Akane turned and faced the television, deciding to switch<br/>the channel, suddenly. "I wonder what's on..." she<br/>pondered.<p>Ranma softly chuckled and said, "I get the feeling we're all<br/>alone again."<p>Ranma looked at his food, finished it in a few bites and<br/>then sat next to Akane, watching the TV. He did this in<br/>such a casual way, however, that for several minutes, Akane<br/>hardly noticed.<p>The program was somewhat schizophrenic. One moment, it was<br/>a dramatic romance, the next moment there would be long<br/>fighting scenes and chases followed by explosions, the next<br/>moment there would be goofy slapstick and bad gags.<br/>Normally, Akane was torn between a love for horror and a<br/>secret penchant for game shows, but now she became<br/>enraptured in watching something that was surely a<br/>producer's worst nightmare.<p>Ranma usually preferred reading to watching TV, and working<br/>out to reading, but he was more curious about what Akane was<br/>thinking. "You don't have your weapons handy, you know," he<br/>told her.<p>"I know," Akane said.<p>"And we are alone, right?"<p>"Right."<p>The program paused for a commercial break, and suddenly<br/>there was dead air-a black screen and complete silence.<p>"Aren't you afraid I might try something?" Ranma said, after<br/>a few seconds.<p>Akane turned to him and asked, "Like what?"<p>Ranma continued to look serious for a few moments, then<br/>started laughing, just as the TV returned to its usual<br/>blather of mindless advertising.<p>Akane frowned and gave him a look of dire import, then<br/>quickly turned back to the TV.<p>Ranma wasn't sure for a moment, then inexplicably recognized<br/>that look and shivered with apprehension. He then cleared<br/>his throat nervously and said, "I spoke with Ukyo today."<p>"What'd she have to say?"<p>"Nothing much," Ranma said, thinking for a moment. "Just<br/>how the business was going, for the most part."<p>"You liar," Akane said.<p>Ranma smiled and said, "No, really. I think Ukyo was just<br/>being polite."<p>"I think Ukyo should mind her own business," Akane quipped.<p>"Akane..."<p>"Huh?"<p>"Well... It isn't nice to be jealous, you know?"<p>For a moment, Akane smiled in a way that reminded Ranma of<br/>how Nabiki would smile-somewhat devil-may-care-and Ranma<br/>started to sense that this whole situation was somehow<br/>staged.<p>"Akane," he started again.<p>"What is it?" she asked.<p>"Am I just imagining it, or are you coming on to me?"<p>Akane was a little stunned. Normally, whenever fielding a<br/>question like that, Akane would counter it by grabbing the<br/>nearest blunt object and bashing Ranma over the head with<br/>it-usually giving him a stern criticism in the process.<br/>Now, it seemed to her that he could actually see what she<br/>was thinking, and she was rather mortified to have been so<br/>transparent. Then she realized that it was true and became<br/>somewhat more mortified by the mere fact of what she'd been<br/>doing.<p>Though his question and the manner in which he'd asked it<br/>were like icy water thrown in her face, Akane suddenly found<br/>herself staring at Ranma, willing herself to be calm in<br/>spite of wanting to bite him really hard.<p>Ranma, nervous and apprehensive in a way he'd never<br/>experienced before in his life, could only watch helplessly<br/>as the two of them had several moments when it seemed like<br/>there was an unspoken invitation in the air. Several times,<br/>Ranma had felt an urge to grab Akane by the arms and throw<br/>himself all over her, but he'd also fought it-knowing<br/>somehow that he'd never see her the same way again,<br/>afterward.<p>The feeling passed, and Ranma was a little relieved when<br/>Akane said, "I don't know what you're talking about, Ranma."<br/>Akane then laughed nervously and said, "Me? Come on to<br/>you?"<p>Ranma flinched in surprise, noticing that Ukyo was sitting<br/>next to him. He hadn't been aware of when she had come in.<p>"I agree," Ukyo said. "It's ridiculous."<p>Ranma and Akane were recovering from the intense shock of<br/>suddenly finding Ukyo sitting next to them as Ukyo smoothly<br/>continued laughing and nudged Ranma in a playfully<br/>sympathetic way.<p>"Now, Ranma here," Ukyo continued. "Woo! That's a whole<br/>other story. You should have seen him, today."<p>"What?" Akane asked, immediately curious.<p>"Well..." Ukyo started, looking at Ranma slyly and leaning<br/>around to whisper something to Akane. For several seconds,<br/>Ukyo whispered to Akane as Akane became redder with shame or<br/>anger (or perhaps both). Ukyo then laughed delightedly as<br/>Akane glared at Ranma, and Ranma scowled in innocent<br/>confusion.<p>Akane then slapped Ranma and exclaimed, "You jerk!"<p>"What!" Ranma asked, rubbing his face. "What was that<br/>for?"<p>"Oh, come on, Ranma," Ukyo nudged him again. She then<br/>winked at him as she said, "You know what that's for."<p>Akane fumed for a few moments and then said, "I can't<br/>believe you! Flirting! And right in front of Ukyo, too!"<p>"Whoa," Ranma said, trying to make some sense of this<br/>conversation. "I did what?"<p>"Now, Ranma," Ukyo told him. "Don't try to deny it. I was<br/>right there. You kept going on about how much more manly<br/>you've become. Everyone in the shop could hear you. I<br/>wouldn't be surprised if everyone in town is talking about<br/>it."<p>Ranma took a moment to consider, and he found that it was an<br/>unmistakably slanderous thing to say. Ranma had,<br/>historically, been fond of describing himself, but only in<br/>serious situations where it was his self-esteem at stake.<p>Had Ranma been a clever person, he might have found a way to<br/>blunt Ukyo's foray, but Ranma was still thinking defensively<br/>as he said, "But I really didn't..."<p>"You mean," Akane said, "you weren't going on about<br/>yourself? So, you were kissing up to her?"<p>"No, I mean I wasn't-" Ranma tried to say, as Akane<br/>interrupted him.<p>"Ranma, that is so pathetic!" Akane said. "I've seen you do<br/>some low things before, but this is the lowest!"<p>"What?" Ukyo said, assuming a defensive position between<br/>Akane and Ranma. "I thought it was kinda cute. I'd never<br/>actually seen Ranma flirting with a girl before."<p>Ranma at last realized something that had been fighting for<br/>attention in his mind. Why was Ukyo so insistent? If it<br/>was a joke, she had definitely gone too far. Ranma decided<br/>to try and get to the bottom of this, and he said, "Very<br/>funny, Ucchan."<p>"Huh?" Ukyo said, flustered for barely a moment, "Hey, I'm<br/>serious. You know I wouldn't joke about something like<br/>this."<p>"Really?" Ranma said, trying to sound just a bit skeptical.<p>Akane had been thinking that Ranma was relapsing into his<br/>normal routine, and now it seemed to her that Ukyo's story<br/>seemed a little too convenient. Akane frowned as she<br/>considered this, and Ukyo immediately picked up on what<br/>Akane was thinking.<p>"Really," Ukyo insisted. "I'll bet you were putting the<br/>moves on Akane before I showed up."<p>"No way," Ranma reacted, then immediately regretted falling<br/>for such an obvious ploy.<p>Akane had always had a strange imagination, so she promptly<br/>said, "Ranma accused me of being jealous."<p>Now Ranma was nearly becoming upset, but his common sense<br/>had fully kicked in, and he said, "Well, now I'm accusing<br/>Ukyo of being jealous."<p>"Oh," Ukyo said, "are you making a move on me?"<p>Akane turned to Ukyo and said, "Ukyo, would please just shut<br/>up for a moment?" Akane then asked Ranma, "Okay, Ranma.<br/>Just level with me..."<p>"It's not true," Ranma said. "I wasn't flirting with<br/>anyone."<p>Akane continued glaring at Ranma for a few moments, then<br/>shifted her eyes to Ukyo. "Ukyo, what is your problem?"<p>"What? You don't believe me?" Ukyo asked her.<p>"Why should I?" Akane asked.<p>"Because it's the truth," Ukyo stated flatly.<p>"Maybe I should ask around," Akane said.<p>"You do that," Ukyo said, knowing full well that it was<br/>already one of several rumors, anyway.<p>Akane felt that the impasse had settled on her, so she<br/>simply blew it off the way she would normally, saying,<br/>"Well, I don't care even if it is true. Ranma can flirt<br/>with whoever he likes."<p>With that, Ukyo seemed satisfied and she politely turned and<br/>left.<p>Ranma and Akane were, of course, fully aware of what Ukyo<br/>had done, and it might have seemed best for them to simply<br/>ignore her. Instead, Ranma found himself marvelling at<br/>Ukyo's audacity, and Akane was merely shocked that she had<br/>believed anything Ukyo had said. Suffice it to say that<br/>Ukyo had totally ruined the mood, and there wasn't a chance<br/>that anything even remotely romantic was going to happen<br/>that night.<p>***<p>That night, Ukyo had a visitor.<p>Nodoka Saotome-Ranma's mother-normally went from place to<br/>place in search of cooking tips or historical trinkets of<br/>the Saotome family whenever she wasn't house-hunting. Quite<br/>often, she would find herself spending many hours listening<br/>to the tales of those to whom she had found herself<br/>referred. It wasn't unusual for her to have to spend the<br/>night at an unfamiliar house or apartment.<p>In fact, she hadn't seen Ranma in several weeks, and she was<br/>starting to worry. She knew that Ranma was in good hands,<br/>and she felt deeply that Ranma himself was strong and<br/>independent. Still, she couldn't shake the notion that<br/>Ranma might need a mother's tender attention.<p>Nodoka was going by Ucchan's, and she initially thought<br/>about passing by, but then she became curious. Ranma and<br/>the others had told her about Ukyo, but there were so many<br/>questions that Nodoka was anxious to ask her.<p>When Nodoka knocked at the door, there wasn't any response,<br/>so she tried the door, and to her surprise it slid right<br/>open. Nodoka reacted in alarm-thinking that leaving the<br/>door open was simply inviting trouble to come in-and she<br/>entered cautiously.<p>Meanwhile, Ukyo had been upstairs muttering to herself-or<br/>rather, since Konatsu Kunoichi was likely lurking in the<br/>shadows somewhere, she was speaking to him. In any case,<br/>Ukyo felt alone with her thoughts and there was plenty for<br/>her to think about. She didn't seem to care whether anyone<br/>thought she was talking to herself. What was worse, she<br/>began to realize that Ranma didn't seem to care, either.<p>"Ranma, you pathetic jerk," she muttered. "How can you be<br/>so incredibly stupid? I can't believe just how massively<br/>stupid you can be. What a complete and total idiot..."<p>Ukyo only really had one particular theme on her mind.<p>"I guess that must make me the world's stupidest woman," she<br/>added, thoughtfully. "Someone with brains might have<br/>noticed what a fool they were being made of. Or could I be<br/>wrong?"<p>It certainly did seem to her that Ranma was slipping away.<br/>Ranma's odd behavior seemed to signify a sudden change, and<br/>what change could have come over him greater than some<br/>involvement with Akane? It didn't follow with what she had<br/>witnessed at the Tendo's, but something was telling her that<br/>she needed to do something drastic, and quickly.<p>As she was stewing over this thought in her mind, and had<br/>gotten up from bed for the third time in the past hour,<br/>Ukyo noticed an intruder as she started down the stairs.<br/>She almost gave herself away with a gasp, and then she<br/>carefully continued down into her shop.<p>The intruder was swift and silent as a mouse and extremely<br/>light on her feet in spite of seeming nothing out of the<br/>ordinary. Ukyo noticed with irritation that this intruder<br/>could have stolen any number of items from her shop by now,<br/>and Ukyo was about to ask who it was when the intruder said,<br/>"Ukyo! Hello?"<p>Ukyo repressed an urge to shriek in surprise, and when she<br/>calmed herself, she answered, "Hello."<p>The intruder, who of course was Nodoka, turned and smiled,<br/>saying, "Oh, there you are. I'm sorry, but the door was<br/>open so I let myself in. I hope you don't mind."<p>By now, Ukyo was starting to remember who this woman was,<br/>and then all at once it came to her. This was the woman who<br/>seemed to like Akane so much and wanted nothing more for her<br/>son than for him to marry Akane. Ukyo then remembered with<br/>some embarrassment that she had helped destroy Nodoka's old<br/>house.<p>Ukyo was relieved that all Nodoka wanted was to sit and have<br/>a conversation over a cup of tea with her.<p>To be sure, Nodoka was not a pleasant person for Ukyo to<br/>talk to, but Ukyo had become bored and a little lonely.<br/>Maybe speaking with the mother would endear her to Ranma,<br/>after all. Ukyo had only seen Ranma refer to his mother<br/>once, and it had been in a quiet and reverent tone of voice.<p>After a short time, Ukyo noticed that Nodoka was not<br/>inclined to turn down an offer of sake, though she would not<br/>allow Ukyo to touch it in her presence and wondered out loud<br/>what Ukyo had been doing with it in the first place.<p>And though Nodoka drank and drank, there did not seem to be<br/>any change in her mood or in the subjects she was willing to<br/>discuss. Nodoka seemed to have a wealth of priceless<br/>secrets regarding cooking lore, where to find special items<br/>of clothing, and forbidden stories of particular warrior<br/>clans.<p>Ukyo kept a tight lip about her past, offering few details<br/>other than the fact that she had been betrothed to Ranma at<br/>one point, but that, "things just didn't work out." She had<br/>toyed with notion of attempting to win Nodoka's confidence,<br/>but Ukyo knew that it would backfire if she pressed Ranma to<br/>make a sudden choice.<p>Ukyo was also aware of how Ranma viewed her and she wanted<br/>Ranma to maintain some respect for her as long as possible.<p>Nodoka asked her how things had gone for her before setting<br/>up shop, but Ukyo glossed over it with as few details as<br/>possible. Ukyo wasn't ashamed of her past, but she knew<br/>that there was nothing romantic about having to go live with<br/>her grandparents, either.<p>Before either one was aware of it, the nighttime had fully<br/>settled, and Ukyo invited her to stay over. Nodoka was<br/>pleasant about it and did not object too strongly, so Ukyo<br/>felt that she had succeeded in taking this first step-<br/>winning over Nodoka's trust. Nodoka was still a little<br/>upset about the door having been unlocked, but no one was<br/>perfect, after all.<p>By the time Ukyo had gone to bed, she had resolved to make<br/>Nodoka's stay so pleasant that she would not help but<br/>return.<p>***<p>Now, Ukyo was normally as pleasant and amiable as a person<br/>could be whenever things were going well for her. That<br/>morning, Nodoka was surprised to notice that not only was<br/>Ukyo extremely easy-going, she fairly radiated confident<br/>well-being in her attitude.<p>Ukyo herself, found that having an excuse to be nice and<br/>nearly as well-mannered as this woman made her feel much<br/>more secure. Though she had thought of a hundred defensive<br/>criticisms and counter-accusations, Ukyo found herself<br/>unable to say anything other than how beautiful the morning<br/>was and how fresh the air seemed-especially with the scent<br/>of breakfast to help fill the air.<p>Ukyo was therefore a little disappointed that Nodoka felt<br/>the need to leave so quickly, but she thanked Ukyo for<br/>letting her stay and made it clear that she enjoyed herself.<p>Then, just before she left, Nodoka made sure to sternly warn<br/>Ukyo not to touch any of the sake, and this put Ukyo in a<br/>bad mood all over again.<p>***<p>At the Tendo home, Kasumi and Nabiki had still not returned,<br/>but Soun and Nodoka were sitting at breakfast as Ranma<br/>stumbled in from having just awoken and Akane returned from<br/>jogging.<p>It seemed Nodoka had found time to be invited over yesterday<br/>but had somehow gotten preoccupied on the way. By way of<br/>apology, she agreed to fix Ranma and Akane some nice lunches<br/>as Soun was heating up the breakfast Kasumi had made for<br/>them yesterday.<p>At breakfast, Nodoka smilingly reported her visit with Ukyo<br/>and admitted that she felt very welcome there.<p>Akane skeptically asked, "Really?"<p>"Oh yes," Nodoka replied. "In fact, I'd really like for all<br/>of us to go to her shop this evening for supper. If it's<br/>not too forward of me, I think it would really help smooth<br/>things over between herself and your family, Akane."<p>Ranma and Akane suddenly thought of what Ukyo had pulled<br/>just last night, and though Akane felt a headache coming on,<br/>Ranma began to think that his mother was probably right.<br/>Ranma said, "Hey, now that's a good idea."<p>Ranma then looked at Akane and thought again, as Akane<br/>glared at him narrowly.<p>"I mean," Ranma added, "Ukyo isn't going to go nuts and<br/>trash her own place, right?"<p>Akane thought for a moment, smirked and said, "Yeah. That's<br/>right."<p>Just then, Genma appeared (as a panda, since it was less<br/>complicated than dealing with his wife as a man), as Soun<br/>added, "And from what I've seen of her, Ukyo is someone who<br/>appreciates honesty."<p>Akane rolled her eyes a bit, thinking how delicately her<br/>father had used the word "appreciates." Nodoka, who didn't<br/>seem to notice this subtlety, clapped her hands together in<br/>delight and said, "Good! I just know that Ukyo will<br/>appreciate our company. She seemed so tragic and helpless<br/>living all on her own."<p>From her tone, it didn't seem possible that Nodoka might be<br/>upset, but Ranma and Akane were nevertheless wondering<br/>whether Nodoka hadn't heard some of Ukyo's tragic tale.<br/>Ranma then wondered whether they had ever bothered to fill<br/>her in on the details, then skipped the thought as Nodoka<br/>handed him and Akane their lunches and hurried them out the<br/>door toward school.<p>On the way, Akane asked Ranma, "Ranma, have you told your<br/>mother about Ukyo?"<p>"Well," he answered, "a little bit."<p>"Does she know about...?"<p>"I don't think so," Ranma answered.<p>Just a glance between them was all they needed to convey the<br/>fact that they weren't comfortable with this idea and that<br/>they thought it was a horrible mistake, but they were going<br/>to go through with it anyway just to make his mother feel<br/>better, and that they were resolved to not breathe a word<br/>about Ukyo's tragic past-or any more than they absolutely<br/>needed to say.<p>***<p>As for the ugly turn of events that was to befall them that<br/>evening, Ranma and Akane had both felt it in their bones,<br/>and they both later said so, in that precise manner.<p>So, it might be best to skip ahead to the events of that<br/>evening, and not bother mentioning how Ukyo had first taken<br/>the news of the impending Tendo visit gleefully, then had<br/>finally become bitter and resentful for some odd reason, and<br/>then had mysteriously burst into tears in the middle of<br/>serving a few customers. As has been stated, it was not<br/>going to be a trivial matter.<p>But whatever Ukyo's mood the moment before their arrival,<br/>Ukyo's mood had elevated to mythical proportions when she<br/>saw them arrive, and Ukyo was even seemingly glad to welcome<br/>Akane and her father. Ranma and his parents joined, shortly<br/>behind them.<p>A table had been prepared for them and the shop closed, and<br/>Ukyo cheerfully brought to their table a large dish that<br/>appeared to be a kind of meat loaf.<p>Ranma and Genma were overjoyed at the smell, and they<br/>immediately announced their intentions and ate. Akane,<br/>overwhelmed by a brief vision inspired by Titus Andronicus,<br/>was a little more reluctant-thinking that perhaps Ukyo had<br/>butchered Nabiki and Kasumi, and had baked them into their<br/>meal.<p>Akane then realized that reality was rarely as morbid as her<br/>imagination, and decided to enjoy her meal.<p>For some time after they had eaten-or Ranma and Genma<br/>anyway, who had eaten quickly-they were at a loss for<br/>things to talk about. Ukyo sensed that Nodoka and Soun<br/>weren't about to start talking, so Ukyo started by asking<br/>them about whether the meal was pleasant and whether they<br/>wanted something more to drink than the tea she provided.<p>After they were all finished and everyone except Nodoka<br/>seemed thoroughly awkward about having nothing more to<br/>discuss than the usual topics, Nodoka very formally thanked<br/>Ukyo for the meal and then stunned them all by saying that<br/>she believed Ukyo would make someone a very good wife<br/>someday.<p>Nodoka then glanced around at all the amazed looks and<br/>gaping expressions and asked, "I'm sorry. Did I say<br/>something rude?"<p>Ukyo was the first to say, "No! No! I'm very flattered.<br/>Really! I'm just glad you enjoyed it."<p>"That's such a relief," Nodoka said. "I hate to offend<br/>people, you know."<p>"I know," Ukyo said.<p>"If you don't mind me saying so," Nodoka added, "you're very<br/>pretty, too. It's hard to imagine you having trouble<br/>finding a husband."<p>For just a moment, Ukyo seemed to have a seriously annoyed<br/>expression which immediately softened into a reluctant<br/>smile.<p>Nodoka, who had been watching Ukyo, said, "Oh, I'm sorry! I<br/>didn't mean to be rude!"<p>"It's true, though," Ranma said.<p>Genma and Soun glared at Ranma, but Ranma merely smiled very<br/>casually.<p>"It is, isn't it?" Nodoka said. "No offense, Ukyo, but why<br/>in the world would you want to burden yourself with my son?<br/>You must have men lined up who would want to marry you."<p>"Mrs. Saotome," Akane said, a warning note in her voice.<p>"No," Nodoka told Akane, "I want to hear. I'm very<br/>curious." Nodoka turned to Ukyo and said, "Surely, you<br/>didn't take that betrothal you received ten years ago all<br/>that seriously."<p>Ukyo, caught off-guard by that remark, scowled, and Akane<br/>rushed to say, "Maybe this is something we should talk about<br/>some other time, huh?"<p>Ukyo then hurriedly said, "I don't, actually."<p>Akane, who hadn't fully realized that Ukyo was responding to<br/>Nodoka's assertion was momentarily confused, and Ukyo used<br/>the interim to continue.<p>"It's all water under the bridge," Ukyo added. "I say, let<br/>bygones be bygones."<p>Genma, enormously relieved for that moment, cringed the next<br/>moment to hear his wife speaking again.<p>"Is it, really?" Nodoka asked. "You sound to me like you've<br/>given it a lot of thought."<p>For a few moments, there was complete silence. Soun was<br/>certainly not going to say a word, and neither was Genma.<p>"I have," Ukyo then admitted. "And you know what? I'm<br/>glad. I don't want to think about it anymore. To tell you<br/>the truth, I'm completely over it. So, could we drop it?"<p>"Oh my," Nodoka said, sounding a little alarmed, "you really<br/>sound upset."<p>"I'm not!" Ukyo denied it.<p>"Oh, but you are!" Nodoka insisted. "Clearly, this is<br/>something that's been bothering you since then."<p>Ukyo grimaced again, trying not to sound upset and failing<br/>again. "But it really doesn't! I mean it doesn't. I'm not<br/>upset."<p>Nodoka looked at Ukyo pleadingly, but Ukyo just turned away,<br/>and now Nodoka was the one who was upset. She turned to<br/>Ranma and asked, "What is it?"<p>When Ranma looked casually undecided how to answer that,<br/>Nodoka asked him, "What's going on?"<p>Ranma looked down, and he began to realize that no one was<br/>going to help him. Nevertheless, he continued in silence,<br/>until his mother said, "Ranma, tell me exactly how it<br/>happened."<p>***<p>Now, the story of how Genma had agreed to marry Ranma to<br/>Ukyo and then had stolen their family business-abandoning<br/>Ukyo in the process-was a very well-known story to all of<br/>them except Nodoka, and she grew more and more grim with<br/>every detail that Ranma casually related.<p>Afterward, Nodoka merely said, "I see." Then she got up and<br/>dragged Genma outside, where they talked heatedly for a few<br/>minutes-or rather, Nodoka spoke heatedly and Genma mostly<br/>just listened.<p>After listening for about minute or so, Ukyo wryly smiled<br/>and said, "Boy am I glad I'm in here."<p>Akane glanced at Ukyo venomously and then turned away. At<br/>that moment, Ukyo realized that she now had the upper hand.<br/>Ukyo had not only won Nodoka's trust, but she had won<br/>Nodoka's sympathy. And Ranma might defy his father, but he<br/>would never defy his mother.<p>They couldn't quite understand what was being said, and<br/>somehow having to imagine it was making them terrified of<br/>what Nodoka might be demanding.<p>Ranma, in particular, was having several anxious moments-<br/>thinking about all the possible demands she might make of<br/>him to try to rectify the situation. Even ritual suicide<br/>was not entirely out of the question.<p>A few moments later, Genma returned and said to Ukyo, "My<br/>wife gratefully appreciates the meal, and she said she<br/>enjoyed it very much. She also wishes to apologize for her<br/>rudeness, tonight."<p>It seemed Nodoka wasn't returning, and she had left Genma to<br/>deliver to them all the news of how the situation was going<br/>to be settled.<p>Genma seemed very reluctant to continue for a few moments,<br/>but then said, "I'm sorry, Soun."<p>Soun Tendo, who was a little surprised that Genma had used<br/>his given name, could only stammer out, "What is it, Genma?"<p>"I'm afraid..." Genma said, "I'm going to have to retract<br/>what we agreed before. It's only right that I..." Genma<br/>sighed deeply and said, "I'm giving my blessing to Ukyo."<p>***<p>After Ukyo had grudgingly accepted, it only remained for<br/>Ranma and Genma to pack up and leave the Tendo home.<p>As they arrived, Nabiki and Kasumi were also just arriving.<br/>They were a little confused to see Ranma and his father<br/>leaving, but they had seen Ranma and Genma go off on<br/>training missions several times before, so they weren't too<br/>surprised.<p>As he had packed, Ranma began to remember all the times that<br/>he had insulted Akane and had made her feel that he never<br/>really regretted any of it. Over and over he began to<br/>recall Akane's anger and sorrow, and he felt now more than<br/>he had ever that Akane had deserved so much better than the<br/>way he had treated her.<p>He was disgusted with himself-and with all the changes his<br/>personality had shown him how much better he could be, he<br/>was all the more repulsed at his former behavior.<p>Standing at the front walkway outside the entrance, he felt<br/>more regret than he could ever recall in his life, and he<br/>took a look back to see Kasumi waving her usual, cheerful<br/>goodbye.<p>Genma only put a hand on Ranma's shoulder and said, "Son, be<br/>a man. Let's go, huh?"<p>With that, they turned and left the Tendo home.<p>Genma was half-expecting it-and hoping it wouldn't be true-<br/>but before long, he discovered that Ranma had changed back<br/>to a girl again.<br/>
</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>
