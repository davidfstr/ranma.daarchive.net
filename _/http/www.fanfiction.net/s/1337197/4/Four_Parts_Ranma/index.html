</div><p>Part 4: The Dark Horse<p>Ranma knew better than anybody that although Ukyo was, for<br/>example, a somewhat more pleasant person to date than<br/>Shampoo, Ukyo was also far more annoying to have to live<br/>with than a hundred Shampoos.<p>Ukyo was lively and entertaining, but her devotion to Ranma<br/>was disturbing.<p>Ukyo had entertained suitors by the hundreds, to be sure.<br/>Many of them were like Tsubasa Kurenai-who was a very<br/>strange girly-boy. To her, those boys all seemed like<br/>dangerous and perverse idiots. Many of the others were<br/>extremely normal, and Ukyo's passion for martial arts<br/>okonomiyaki had been something to which they could never<br/>hope to relate.<p>Then there were others who-like Konatsu Kunoichi-were<br/>somewhere in between these two extremes. Ukyo was<br/>thoroughly bored with people like them, however, and she<br/>dismissed them from her mind the quickest.<p>Ranma, however, had seemed to take pity on her when they had<br/>first met-and Ukyo had been charmed by his abrupt manner in<br/>doing so.<p>So, of course, there was no reasonable opportunity that Ukyo<br/>would pass up to make some impression on Ranma, and Ranma<br/>was beginning to realize it. He was also beginning to<br/>realize that Ukyo's idea of romance was more like Stockholm<br/>syndrome than like a Shakespearean sonnet.<p>And though the prospect of having to live with Ukyo for the<br/>rest of his life was like plunging into the depths of hell,<br/>Ranma smiled and seemed eager to go. It was nothing<br/>compared to the thought of being truly cut off from the<br/>Tendo home.<p>Something had gone out of him at the thought of never seeing<br/>Akane again, and Ranma began to realize that this had been<br/>in keeping with his two previous transformations. And just<br/>as he realized that, he also noticed that he had become a<br/>she again.<p>"Ah, crap," Ranma said, looking at herself.<p>"Finally noticed, huh?" Genma said.<p>***<p>Genma had never been a very ponderous man, but if he had, he<br/>might have noticed that he'd been very anxious for ten years<br/>over something that had turned out to be a matter of about<br/>five minutes of regret.<p>In fact, he was a bit grateful to Ranma for being the one to<br/>explain it all, and to be there to help blunt some of the<br/>heat he might otherwise have to take himself. He didn't<br/>need to admit it, and Ranma was free to imagine it, if she<br/>so chose.<p>Now, it was the future that was worrying him. Genma stopped<br/>at a crossroads between a major road and the road that led<br/>toward Ukyo's shop. For nearly five whole seconds, Genma<br/>stopped and found himself unequal to this task.<p>"Hey, Pop," Ranma said. "Ain't we going to Ucchan's?"<p>"Ranma, my boy," Genma answered, "I need you to listen very<br/>carefully. Which do you like better? Ukyo or okonomiyaki?"<p>Ranma was stunned for a moment, then she laughed and said,<br/>"Pop, I think I already answered that, like ten years ago."<p>"I need you to be serious, Ranma," Genma insisted, "and give<br/>me an answer. Or is that still your answer?"<p>"I don't know," Ranma replied, not really thinking.<p>"Is it?"<p>"I don't know. Can I think about it?"<p>"What's to think about?"<p>"I don't know!" Ranma then scratched her head and sat on<br/>the fence, thinking.<p>"So, you like Ukyo better?" Genma guessed.<p>"Geez," Ranma said. "What's gotten into you, Pop? What's<br/>with this stupid question? How do you expect me to answer<br/>if you won't explain the reason why you're askin'?"<p>"I want a straight, simple answer, Ranma," he explained.<br/>"Nothing more. If it's something you can't decide, then<br/>I'll have to assume what your answer is, and that'll be it."<p>"Whoa," Ranma said softly. "Serious..."<p>"This is serious, Ranma." Genma then sighed and added, "The<br/>next ten years is riding on your answer."<p>With that little revelation, Ranma was stunned into a kind<br/>of unthinking silence. Looking at the expression on her<br/>father's face, however, she knew that she needed to give an<br/>honest answer, and soon.<p>Genma and Ranma said, together, "Okonomiyaki-"<p>"Yeah," Genma said. "That's what I thought. Okay, let's<br/>go."<p>And, having said that, Genma started toward Ukyo's shop<br/>again. A few moments later, Ranma got up and strolled along<br/>the fence top after her father.<p>"What was that about?" Ranma asked.<p>"It's about friendship, Ranma," Genma answered. "I've come<br/>to value my friendship with Akane's father quite a lot,<br/>recently."<p>"Uh huh," Ranma said. "Does this loop back around to that<br/>question at some point?"<p>"I'm getting there," Genma muttered. "Now, where to begin?"<br/>Genma then stopped and pondered for a moment, then said,<br/>"Right. Let's go back a bit. Just a few weeks ago, I<br/>asked Soun about our friendship."<p>***<p>In fact, this event to which Genma was referring was between<br/>the time when they had received the invitation and the time<br/>of the wedding of Ryoga and Akari. One evening, over tea<br/>and a game of go, Genma happened to be casually musing.<p>"Seeing how Ranma and Ryoga are still friends," Genma<br/>guessed (since he wasn't really sure that they were<br/>friends), "really makes me wonder."<p>"It's inspiring, isn't it?" Soun said.<p>"Yes," Genma said, after a moment of hesitation. "Anyway, I<br/>was thinking that Ranma and Ryoga wouldn't let a little<br/>thing like marriage stand between them."<p>"Ah, yes," Soun agreed. "A true friendship. A thing to be<br/>admired, Saotome."<p>"I envy them," Genma said.<p>"So do I," Soun casually agreed.<p>After a few more moments, Genma asked, "So, if Ranma and<br/>Akane don't really work out...?"<p>Soun laughed for a few moments, then looked suddenly grim<br/>and stated, "Don't even think about it, Saotome."<p>***<p>"I knew right then," Genma said to Ranma, "that if Ukyo was<br/>standing in my way, I would have to choose the more<br/>difficult path, eventually. However, I needed to know<br/>whether that was true."<p>"The more difficult path?" Ranma asked.<p>"A return to training," Genma stated.<p>Ranma wasn't sure what Genma meant by all this, but she knew<br/>in simple terms what Genma was implying. "Well, if you<br/>think I've decided to marry Akane, forget it! I'll make up<br/>my own mind when I'm good and ready."<p>"Right," Genma said, a little humoringly. "Just keep in<br/>mind that I never said you couldn't."<p>This had the subtle tone of hedging, and it made Ranma<br/>curious about what Nodoka had told Genma. Try as she might,<br/>though, there was just no getting from him what Nodoka had<br/>told him.<p>All Genma would tell her was, "Your mother is a woman of<br/>high standards," which was nothing new to Ranma.<p>In retrospect, Ranma realized that she should have been<br/>content with that, but something about it just seemed all<br/>wrong, at the time.<p>***<p>For her own part, Ukyo felt that this situation was too good<br/>to be true, but at the same time she didn't want to upset a<br/>good thing. So, when Genma and Ranma showed up at her shop<br/>door that night, she had some difficulty pretending to be<br/>surprised and acting like she was going out of her way to be<br/>helpful and obliging to them.<p>She wanted to be annoyed-and she certainly had every right<br/>to expect annoyance in her mood-but her heart was soaring<br/>much too high for this to happen.<p>And just when it seemed that one of Ranma's snide remarks<br/>would send her over the edge into being slightly miffed, she<br/>began to notice something that Nabiki had told her a few<br/>days ago. Ranma had really changed, and it showed.<p>Ranma's face-usually a blend of puckish deviousness and<br/>childish innocence-was starting to turn statuesque in its<br/>distinctive features. For a moment, Ukyo merely felt as if<br/>Ranma had become taller and more impressive, then she<br/>realized that it was just the effect of Ranma's face. And<br/>though she understood that it was just the subtle change in<br/>proportions, she was nevertheless made speechless with awe<br/>at the change.<p>When Ranma became casually curious about why Ukyo was<br/>staring, Ukyo started and promptly brought back a pot full<br/>of hot water.<p>Genma amused himself with helping, as Ukyo dumped pot after<br/>pot of hot water on Ranma-wondering why Ranma suddenly<br/>wasn't changing back to male-type.<p>***<p>Over the next few days, Ukyo continued to be blissfully<br/>unaware of the events that were about to take place, and<br/>Akane was her usual angry self. There was little that could<br/>have occurred between the time when Ranma moved out of the<br/>Tendo home and into the new house.<p>Nodoka, who had made extensive notes toward writing an<br/>autobiography, never bothered to publish such a document, so<br/>we can only speculate as to what had happened. In any case,<br/>it was probably in keeping with what had gone on before.<p>Ranma surely continued to attend Furinkan high school-it<br/>was the same high school that Ukyo attended, after all-and<br/>he probably encountered Kuno and Kodachi several times. All<br/>this was simply part of a normal day for Ranma.<p>The only thing that had changed, other than the fact that<br/>Shampoo had mysteriously returned to China, was that when<br/>Ranma left school, he now went to Ucchan's.<p>What Ranma and Akane said or did while at school, however,<br/>was something they never discussed later. It seems unlikely<br/>that they said anything to one another, in spite of the many<br/>rumors to the contrary.<p>In her diary, Ukyo was very detailed about the things she<br/>said and did over that time, but these were mostly just<br/>quaint reflections on things that had happened to them ten<br/>years ago.<p>One interesting note that Ukyo made was that Genma never<br/>bothered to unpack. She overheard this in a conversation.<p>Ranma asked him, "Aren't you going to unpack?"<p>Genma replied, "No need. We're just going to have to pack<br/>it all up again, anyway."<p>"You think so?" Ranma said.<p>Genma then paused, (and Ukyo never bothered to record<br/>whether he was amused or irritated) and said, "Ranma,<br/>perhaps..."<p>"What?" Ranma asked.<p>A few moments later, Genma said, "Never mind."<p>Perhaps he'd been about to suggest that Ranma start packing<br/>up Ukyo's stuff as well as his own, but even Ukyo didn't<br/>find out about this until a few days later.<p>***<p>"I knew it was too good to be true," Ukyo muttered to<br/>herself.<p>On the way to the new house-to which Ukyo had been invited<br/>to come, of course-Ranma and Genma led the way, as Ukyo<br/>lugged most of the bags.<p>It was mostly her own stuff, actually, but Ukyo had thought<br/>that maybe Ranma or Genma might be persuaded to help carry<br/>them. After all, they were pretty heavy.<p>Ukyo was so busy straining and sweating that she became<br/>preoccupied with being miserable, and she was just starting<br/>to think that at least it wasn't raining when a sudden<br/>downpour began.<p>Ranma and Genma, who considered rain to be a very light<br/>matter, merely shrugged it off and continued strolling down<br/>the street as if nothing in the world were wrong with<br/>walking in the rain.<p>Ukyo, meanwhile, could count the raindrops striking her<br/>head-as if they were all sent to her personally to annoy<br/>her. She sighed and continued to follow Ranma and Genma.<p>It was at this moment that she realized she had always been<br/>following those two as long as she could remember, and they<br/>had always been just ahead of her, always threatening to<br/>leave her behind.<p>Thinking this way had always brought the memory of that<br/>terrible day when Ranma and Genma had abandoned her, leaving<br/>her choking on the dust of her father's own portable<br/>okonomiyaki shop. Even worse than the initial shock of<br/>being left behind was the lingering humiliation that awaited<br/>her, wherever she went, afterward.<p>Ukyo could still feel the sting of that humiliation, but<br/>thought how appropriate it was that Genma had only been the<br/>author of his own humiliation at Ukyo's hands. Ukyo began<br/>to laugh, thinking grimly that you reap what you sow when<br/>she also noticed that she had been completely left behind,<br/>again.<p>"Ack!" she exclaimed. "Wait! Come back! Don't forget me!"<p>***<p>Nodoka, aside from being a woman of high standards, was also<br/>a very considerate mother, and she had soon found a new<br/>house where Genma and Ranma would come to live with her.<p>It was a little old, but it was affordable and cozy. Best<br/>of all, it was conveniently located-not too far from Ukyo's<br/>shop.<p>Ranma and Genma immediately liked it, the moment they<br/>entered-thinking that its slightly rustic charm gave them a<br/>familiar and comfortable surrounding to live in. They<br/>scarcely had furniture, but there was already a table in the<br/>living room and the smell of food in the air-and that was<br/>really all Ranma and Genma needed to call a place home.<p>Nodoka entered from the kitchen with some food already<br/>prepared, and was more than happy to finally have what she<br/>could call a real family event.<p>Ranma and Genma had worked up a ferocious appetite, and they<br/>were soon finished eating. Afterward, they sat around for a<br/>few hours, merely chatting about this and that. None of<br/>them could remember having ever had such a pleasant meal,<br/>right about the time Ukyo appeared-looking a little haggard<br/>and extremely irritated.<p>"Oh my!" Nodoka declared. "I just knew we forgot about<br/>something!"<p>***<p>Ukyo had spent most of the day searching for Ranma and Genma<br/>in vain, asking people who were rarely helpful, then finally<br/>giving up hope of ever finding the house-weeping in misery,<br/>as the rain continued pouring.<p>Then she remembered that, sometime yesterday, she had<br/>overheard a bit of what Genma had told Ranma about how to<br/>get to their new house. She then spent another half an hour<br/>searching her soggy diary for that entry and used it to find<br/>the location where she did, in fact, find Ranma and Genma.<p>"How dare you neglect your own fiancee!" she cried, giving<br/>Ranma a nasty glare, then finally dropping her bags in<br/>disgust, exhausted with having carried them all day.<p>"Oh," Ranma said. She then thought for a moment and said,<br/>"Oops?"<p>Ukyo glowered at her with a furious look, then frowned-<br/>deeply disappointed. "Oops? That's all you have to say?"<p>"Umm," Ranma said, thinking for a moment, "sorry?"<p>"You're killin' me, Ranma," she said. "Please, just try for<br/>once to see things my way, okay?"<p>Ranma seemed to be sizing up that request, then said, "Well,<br/>okay. Although, I don't really see what you're complaining<br/>about. It ain't my fault you can't keep up."<p>Ukyo then rolled her eyes and passed out, unable to<br/>withstand the usual routine from Ranma.<p>"Ranma, my boy-" Genma started.<p>"Oh my," Nodoka said, catching Ukyo.<p>"It pays to have a little tact," Genma said, "when dealing<br/>with normal people. Not everyone has an iron constitution."<p>***<p>When Ukyo awoke, she was momentarily terrified that she'd<br/>been abducted, then she remembered.<p>Nodoka had found a new house for her and her family, to<br/>which Ukyo had been invited to stay, as a guest. After a<br/>miserable day spent finding this place, she was relieved<br/>to find herself still here.<p>Ukyo briefly thought about all the troubles in her life and<br/>she began to count herself lucky that she had arrived at<br/>this place and time. All things considered, there were as<br/>many bad as good things to remember, but as long as the good<br/>things always happened last, that would be okay.<p>For example, if she only needed to contend with a few<br/>harmless setbacks before getting married to Ranma, that<br/>would be good, too. She then sighed and lay back, imagining<br/>the kind of life she would like to have with Ranma and<br/>thinking that she was getting closer, if not actually right<br/>there, yet.<p>Ukyo was just starting to think that the main problem right<br/>now was the mystery of why Ranma was still girl-type when<br/>she heard a knock at the door, and Ranma entered.<p>"Is it okay if I come in?" Ranma said.<p>"Fine, fine," Ukyo said, noticing that she'd been dressed in<br/>pajamas by some thoughtful person-she preferred to think<br/>that it wasn't Ranma or Genma who had done so.<p>"I'm very sorry about yesterday," Ranma said in that casual<br/>way that never failed to anger Akane.<p>Ukyo merely smiled and waved away his apology saying, "Hey!<br/>Hey! Forget about it! I'm here, and that's what counts,<br/>right?"<p>Ranma, not completely adjusted to Ukyo's forthright<br/>attitude, was stunned for a moment, then smiled and said,<br/>"Ah, sure!"<p>Ukyo got up from her bed and looked around at the unfamiliar<br/>room-bare floor aside from the soggy bags which she had<br/>carried with her from the shop. There was a nice, wide<br/>window, and Ukyo opened it, getting a nice deep breath of<br/>fresh morning air.<p>"Good morning!" she exclaimed, thinking how miserable the<br/>sky had become, yesterday, and how clear it looked now.<p>Ranma joined her next to the window, and Ukyo had a nervous<br/>moment to realize that the love of her life was standing<br/>right next to her, and-aside from being the wrong sex-<br/>there wasn't a thing in the world stopping them from being<br/>together as lovers. She had to stop thinking about it,<br/>though, and calm down for a moment, because she wasn't used<br/>to the idea.<p>Ranma surprised her by folding her arms and snidely<br/>remarking, "Morning is overrated."<p>Normally, Ukyo never tired of these obtuse discussions of<br/>life and its relationship with nature-these had, in fact,<br/>filled many hours of their time together as children. Now,<br/>all she could say was, "Ranma, you need your head examined."<p>Ranma chuckled and said, "Not a bad idea, considering."<p>Ukyo leaned on the window sill and said, "So, you agree."<p>For a few long moments, Ranma kept her arms folded, then<br/>said, "Sorry. I'm just not myself."<p>Ukyo took a moment to ponder that and then asked, "Ranma,<br/>how is it that you've become like this? Do you know?"<p>"You mean," Ranma said, "about not changing back?"<p>"No," Ukyo replied. "I mean, what is it that made you<br/>change your attitude? You never changed in all the years I<br/>knew you, but now..."<p>As hard as it was for Ranma to take anything seriously, she<br/>knew there was no escaping this, and she said, "It's in<br/>keeping with something that happened to me, not too long<br/>ago. I'm not exactly sure how, but every time I feel like<br/>someone has really left me, I become more of what I am,<br/>now."<p>"So," Ukyo surmised, "if I were to go away..."<p>"Oh," Ranma answered, "you don't need to worry. Only people<br/>who have been affected by magic seem to do it."<p>"So," Ukyo said, "this is it."<p>"No," Ranma said. "There's one more."<p>Ukyo was about to ask Ranma who it was, but then she heard<br/>an awful commotion from below her window-and she just<br/>happened to notice Genma running toward the house in panda-<br/>form. Ukyo then looked away from the window in irritation<br/>and asked Ranma, "Ranma, are we really living next door to<br/>the Tendos?"<p>Ranma smiled and took a quick look out the window, then<br/>said, "Ah, it seems that way..."<p>***<p>Without anyone having realized it-including Nodoka,<br/>strangely enough-they had, indeed, moved in next door to<br/>the Tendos. There were perhaps never two families in Japan<br/>who were more appropriately located, though there were<br/>plenty of reasons to make them want to live on different<br/>continents.<p>The first person to have discovered this was Genma, who<br/>immediately saw the convenience in having a familiar bath,<br/>koi pond and refrigerator he could raid.<p>The second person to discover their proximity was Akane, who<br/>(coincidentally enough) also discovered Genma in the process<br/>of raiding their refrigerator.<p>Akane had nothing personal against Mr. Saotome, but seeing a<br/>giant panda in her family's kitchen that early in the<br/>morning was a tremendous shock to her, and she wasn't<br/>completely sure at first that it was Genma.<p>Almost immediately, Soun and Akane were in pursuit of Genma<br/>(who still had a big slice of watermelon), and Kasumi<br/>watched as Genma leaped the barrier and Soun followed.<p>Soun and Akane did not have far to travel. Once across the<br/>street and over another barrier, they found Genma entering<br/>another two-story building, and they just assumed he was<br/>invading someone else's residence.<p>They were completely surprised to discover that Nodoka had<br/>evidently joined him in committing trespass. Unable to<br/>fully picture Nodoka this way, they soon realized the<br/>inevitable-that Ranma and his parents were living there.<p>Once Soun realized this, he merely laughed and joked about<br/>how warm the weather was. He then grimly informed Genma<br/>that he now owed Soun a watermelon.<p>Nodoka was eager to invite them in, but Soun politely<br/>excused himself. Akane was reluctant, but her curiosity<br/>took over, and she took the tour.<p>Their house was very similar to the one Akane knew well-the<br/>entrance-area stairway leading up to bedrooms on the second<br/>floor and the well-worn area of the hallway between the<br/>living room and the kitchen were enough to make Akane wonder<br/>how many of these types of houses there were in the<br/>neighborhood.<p>The only real difference, besides the fact that the end of<br/>the house stopped at a fenced tree-line between them and the<br/>other neighbor's house instead of a dojo, was that the<br/>Saotome's had a modest wooden bridge that crossed over a<br/>faux stream. The sense of Zen at this image was completed<br/>when Ranma appeared next to her and said, "I'll bet you're<br/>jealous."<p>Ranma chuckled as Akane turned and immediately said, "I am<br/>not!"<p>Seeing Ranma holding a bowl of food in her usual nimble way<br/>made Akane sentimental for a moment, and she was anxious to<br/>finish touring the house with Nodoka.<p>Akane had a hunch what she would find in the guest room, and<br/>so she was not too surprised to find Ukyo unpacking there.<p>What Ukyo wrote in her diary about that moment is frankly a<br/>little hard to believe, but her diary is the only one that<br/>goes into detail about this encounter:<p>Ukyo said, "Well, if it isn't the ex-fiancee!"<p>Akane frowned and said, "Ukyo? What are you doing here?"<p>"Oh, I live here," Ukyo replied, she then cleared her throat<br/>and added, "As a guest, of course."<p>"Just a guest?" Akane said. "I'd have thought you two would<br/>have been married by now."<p>"Well, I am the 'cute' one," Ukyo agreed.<p>Akane then laughed and glanced at Nodoka-who was fretting<br/>at the state of Ranma's room (just next door to Ukyo's), and<br/>she said, viciously, "If you lay a finger on Ranma, I'll<br/>kill you."<p>"Oh my," Ukyo said, feigning shock. "How scary! I'm<br/>shaking already." Ukyo then laughed and went back to her<br/>unpacking.<p>In her own diary, Kasumi only mentions that Akane took one<br/>look at the smug expression on Ukyo's face and immediately<br/>continued on her tour. While a bit more plausible, it seems<br/>equally unlikely.<p>Both accounts, however, do agree that this was the one time<br/>that Akane visited Ukyo at the new place, so it's just a<br/>pity we can't get a more accurate picture of what happened.<p>Nevertheless, Ukyo did get her share of visitors over the<br/>next few days, and though they failed to give her any death<br/>threats, they certainly did amuse Ukyo. Nabiki, for<br/>example, had plenty to say about the new pictures of Ranma<br/>she was selling, and how Ranma was more than happy to be<br/>busy posing (tastefully, for once).<p>Kasumi found time to visit, as well, and found that Ukyo's<br/>skill at cooking-while unpleasantly aggressive and<br/>barbaric-was far above her own. Ukyo's talents, her<br/>creative flair and her adaptiveness with cooking implements<br/>were beyond what Kasumi had dreamed possible. Best of all,<br/>Ukyo was unaware of her talent-and therefore (unlike most<br/>other talented cooks) she was not an effete snob. To the<br/>contrary, she enjoyed showing off her talents to an<br/>appreciative audience.<p>Kasumi made a point of visiting frequently, mostly because<br/>of her intense disappointment with Akane, and because she<br/>preferred to be the one who was learning rather than trying<br/>to teach.<p>Genma returned to the dojo with Ranma, although they had to<br/>go through the routine of having Happosai give his word that<br/>Ranma would not fail the honor of the Tendo dojo. Soun made<br/>it clear to them that, while he would still welcome them in,<br/>they were outsiders. It was odd that Happosai was<br/>conveniently still Soun's master, although it seemed that<br/>they would only regret that fact all the more in the near<br/>future.<p>Meanwhile, Nodoka found herself more busy with making notes<br/>toward books she would never publish than with making meals.<br/>Nodoka was said to take extremely detailed notes of many of<br/>the casual discussions between Ukyo and Kasumi, and Akane<br/>later swore that Nodoka kept a detailed account somewhere of<br/>all the training sessions that Genma and Ranma held.<p>One thing was fairly certain. Very little had actually<br/>changed between when Ranma had been living at the Tendo's<br/>and now that Ranma had moved next door. Ukyo still spent<br/>the evenings working at her shop, and Nodoka was often<br/>invited along with Ranma and Genma to eat at the Tendo's.<p>Akane and Ranma often sat right next to each other nearest<br/>the windows, as they always had, just as if they were still<br/>intended, and if Ranma was more casual than ever, Akane was<br/>more tense than ever about this situation.<p>The major difference between then and now was that Akane was<br/>nearly always angry with Ranma and now Akane had simply<br/>become nervous.<p>***<p>One evening over a game of shogi, Soun and Genma took the<br/>opportunity of the relatively mild weather to catch up on<br/>the events of the past week and to mull over (as Nabiki put<br/>it) their new strategy regarding what to do about Ranma and<br/>Akane.<p>Genma stated and they both agreed that things were<br/>progressing nicely in spite of having been forced to do away<br/>with the arrangement. Genma further stated that having<br/>removed the arrangement was even more convenient in that it<br/>provided Ranma with no excuse to think of a relationship<br/>with Akane as a burden.<p>Soun mused over this, perhaps thinking that Ukyo was even<br/>less of a burden to Ranma or just wondering what Genma meant<br/>by referring to Akane as a burden in the first place.<p>In any case, Soun still wanted to renew their arrangement,<br/>and although Genma now said that it was quite impossible, he<br/>assured Soun that it would change nothing.<p>"Soun, my friend," Genma said. "You don't seem to<br/>understand. Ranma always hated that arrangement, and I'm<br/>pretty sure Akane did, too. Ranma hates being told to do<br/>anything. Now that it's all on his own shoulders, I'm sure<br/>he'll do the right thing."<p>Soun then frowned and said, "I just hope you're right,<br/>Genma."<p>The wind chimes played right on cue for them and the scene<br/>would have been perfect had Happosai-sitting next to them-<br/>not been making an inventory of the stolen bras and panties<br/>in his sack.<p>***<p>As the days went by, Ranma found that making conversation at<br/>supper was becoming easier, and despite being stuck in girl-<br/>form and technically an outsider, the others still seemed to<br/>think of her as family. In fact, Nabiki and Kasumi never<br/>enjoyed a conversation more with Ranma than they did now.<p>Ranma seemed more easy-going than ever, and there was never<br/>an issue to which she lacked some delightful opinions.<br/>Sometimes Nabiki would say something overly capricious, and<br/>Ranma would become irritated at it-but never more than long<br/>enough to let them know she was irritated. Kasumi was<br/>sometimes too judgmental, and Ranma would ignore those<br/>remarks.<p>Gone were the rude and cynical Ranma, the grumpy Ranma, the<br/>insulting and defensive Ranma, and even the tacky<br/>simpleminded Ranma. If they appeared, they only made the<br/>occasional cameo appearances.<p>What was very strange was that, although Akane surely had<br/>much to say and would have gladly spent many hours<br/>discussing things before, Akane had gone strangely quiet.<p>Akane had become so quiet, in fact, that it came as a<br/>complete surprise when she told Ranma one evening after<br/>supper that she wanted to speak with her.<p>To the disappointment of the others, they spoke in Chinese,<br/>but Akane later shared every word of it.<p>Akane wasted no time, but asked Ranma right out, "Ranma, do<br/>you like me?"<p>Anyone would be stunned at this question, and Ranma was no<br/>exception. Akane cleared her throat and tried again.<p>"What I mean is," Akane said, "I... I think we got off to a<br/>bad start."<p>Ranma chuckled and said, "No kidding."<p>"I mean," Akane floundered (and Kasumi noted here that she<br/>witnessed Akane for the first time poking her own fingers<br/>with embarrassment), "I don't know how I'm supposed to feel<br/>about all this. I'm sorry."<p>"Don't be sorry," Ranma said.<p>"No," Akane objected. "I am sorry. It's all my fault for<br/>getting jealous."<p>When Akane later said this to Kasumi, Kasumi was very<br/>surprised and Kasumi wrote, "Had Ranma been more perceptive,<br/>he might have become very upset when Akane told him that."<p>Instead, Ranma merely smiled wistfully at everything Akane<br/>said, even as Akane continued, "I'm just a complete idiot,<br/>and I've never treated you fairly. I'm very very sorry."<p>And then, to everyone's complete surprise, Ranma gently<br/>reached out and hugged Akane, and Akane softly cried. Ranma<br/>then softly said, "It's okay, Akane. I'm more sorry than<br/>you."<p>***<p>So, now there was no longer any mystery at all about how<br/>Akane and Ranma felt, and although Ranma was clearly not<br/>going to return to male-type any time soon, they felt no<br/>qualms about expressing these feelings any old time of the<br/>day they chose.<p>At school, for example, they were often seen making eye-<br/>contact or sometimes holding hands or even just sharing some<br/>wordless smiles.<p>Some of their fellow students said it was just like Ranma to<br/>fall in love with Akane in girl-form, and others sometimes<br/>remarked that it was appropriate-seeing how Akane never<br/>really liked guys, anyway.<p>Kuno, naturally, was distraught that his ineptness as a man<br/>had driven the two girls he was in love with to "turn into<br/>lesbians."<p>A few of the more insightful students remarked that becoming<br/>Ranma's fiancee was surely a horrible curse, and they made<br/>sure they did so outside of Ukyo's hearing.<p>Whether Ukyo heard it or not, she surely felt it. Ranma and<br/>Akane didn't hide their feelings from Ukyo, and Ukyo soon<br/>became upset with the situation-though she did manage to<br/>hide how she felt for a little while.<p>Ukyo was still a guest at Ranma's house, but it seemed to<br/>her that she was a stranger there. Ranma never spent any<br/>time with her-and the one time she did, she complained<br/>casually to Ukyo that Akane was still far too shy.<p>This remark in particular had made Ukyo extremely upset.<br/>She was briefly tempted to destroy her own shop with her<br/>bare hands when she realized that there was still one last<br/>chance for the situation to change.<p>Ukyo recalled Ranma telling her that there was "one more,"<br/>to go. She had surely meant her own father-Genma. With<br/>Genma out of the way, there would no longer be a reason for<br/>Ranma to feel any pressure to make up with Akane, and Ranma<br/>would experience the final transformation-which could<br/>revert her back to her usual Akane-hating, obnoxious self.<p>But no matter how Ukyo tortured herself with thoughts of how<br/>Genma had ruined her life in the first place, she just<br/>couldn't bring herself to murder the old guy. Ukyo knew in<br/>her guts that nothing less than murder would do, but at the<br/>same time, she felt that she just didn't have quite enough<br/>hatred to be able to do it.<p>On top of that, if Ukyo did kill the old man, how would<br/>Ranma react to her except in stunned horror? It was a<br/>terrible dilemma, no matter how she turned it around in her<br/>mind.<p>***<p>That night, Ukyo had nightmare after nightmare, and in every<br/>one of them, Genma was the villain-taking away her father's<br/>livelihood and leaving her behind in misery and humiliation.<p>As the nightmares repeated, the vision of her father's shop<br/>slowly transformed into Genma carrying Ranma away from her<br/>until Ranma at last abandoned her in her disgrace.<p>In the very last dream just before dawn, Ukyo was lying on<br/>the ground, unable to move or even turn away as the others<br/>laughed at her and ridiculed her-even Genma and Ranma, who<br/>were now calling her a pitiful and gullible fool.<p>Ukyo had been denied sleep because of these dreams, and the<br/>visions of her dream had become so intense that it denied<br/>her of sanity.<p>Shortly afterward, Ukyo found herself still in a dreamlike<br/>state, but now carrying a very real knife and intending to<br/>use it. She found Genma soon enough, sitting at the doorway<br/>to their new backyard, watching as Ranma went through her<br/>usual morning workout. The scene was perfect.<p>The only thing that it lacked was a dead body, stabbed many<br/>times in the back-lying in a pool of its own blood.<p>Ukyo brought up the knife to strike, but she hesitated, and<br/>the knife quickly fell from her limp fingers. No matter how<br/>angry or driven to insanity, there was just no way she was<br/>capable of outright murder. She knew it for a fact, deep<br/>down inside.<p>Her whole life, she had been living for revenge, but she had<br/>also been living with purpose. That purpose had forced her<br/>to pretend to be a guy and to cook at a level far beyond<br/>what others could achieve. It had taken so much pain and<br/>sacrifice, and she couldn't just throw all that away.<p>The knife had scarcely hit the floor when Ukyo realized that<br/>she was completely drained. Nothing mattered anymore. She<br/>only had time to think that at least she had the grim<br/>satisfaction that Ranma would never become a guy, when Ranma<br/>suddenly attacked Genma-kicking him in the head in a way<br/>that would paralyze or kill an ordinary man.<p>Ranma smiled and said, "Yo, Pop! Get up! Don't tell me<br/>that love-tap actually hurt you?"<p>Ukyo looked down at Genma's unmoving body and her mind<br/>totally failed to register that this had any significance.<p>Ranma, however, was quickly at Genma's side, slapping him in<br/>the face, and begging him to get up. It didn't matter,<br/>though. His body would never move again. Ranma called for<br/>his mother and screamed something about calling for a<br/>doctor, as Ukyo realized with some amusement that Ranma had<br/>transformed to a guy again.<p>Ranma didn't realize this until much later, and when Nodoka<br/>appeared, she seemed shocked at first, but then she frowned<br/>and said, pointing, "Ranma, don't scare me like that! Put<br/>that doll away, would you?"<p>"Doll?" Ranma said, a little outraged. "I'm not holding a<br/>doll!"<p>Ranma then looked down at what he was holding, and it was,<br/>indeed, a doll.<p>"Whoa!" Ranma exclaimed. "Pop!"<p>Ukyo blinked in astonishment, suddenly realizing that the<br/>dead body of Genma had actually been a cleverly constructed<br/>doll, and her head swam.<p>A moment later, Ukyo passed out.<p>Epilogue: Hold Your Horses<p>About a week later, Ranma and Akane had a wedding<br/>celebration, and everyone said it was a huge success in<br/>spite of not have the father of the groom on hand. Genma<br/>wasn't dead-although he might have prayed for death when<br/>Nodoka got a hold of him, later on-Genma was just romping<br/>around in his usual panda-form, getting into trouble, as<br/>usual.<p>Genma showed up for the reception-held at the Cat Cafe, of<br/>course. He showed up, looking a little somber, and when<br/>Ranma asked him what that was about, Genma shoved a letter<br/>in his face and said, "Here's the proof. Read it yourself."<p>Ranma read the letter. "Sorry for the confusion. Hope you<br/>enjoyed your abduction." At the bottom of the letter it was<br/>signed, "chi."<p>"Who da heck is 'Chi?'" Ranma asked him, and Genma snatched<br/>the letter back.<p>"I don't know," Genma replied. "I wish I did, though."<p>Genma secretly wanted to thank whoever it was that had<br/>abducted him the morning of his "murder." Genma had awoke<br/>to find himself in a pastry kitchen, and he promptly ate as<br/>many of them as he could. His story had been-like many of<br/>his stories-extremely hard to believe, so Genma now made a<br/>point of proving to Ranma that it was the truth.<p>Ranma, however, was not in the frame of mind to believe it,<br/>and he said, "Bah! I still say you made it up!"<p>Shampoo appeared at that point, and said, "Shampoo believe.<br/>Shampoo got letter just like what panda man get."<p>"So, where is it?" Ranma asked.<p>"Me throw away," Shampoo said.<p>Ranma laughed and said, "Ah, you see? I don't believe it!<br/>It's just another one of Pop's stories."<p>Shampoo then frowned and left the room, saying, "I go find<br/>letter and show you."<p>Akane, still somewhat radiant in her outfit, cleared her<br/>throat and said to Ranma, "Actually, Ranma, I got one of<br/>those, myself."<p>"Really?" Ranma said. "How come you didn't tell me?"<p>"Well," Akane replied, "I thought it was just weird, at the<br/>time."<p>Akane promptly produced her letter, and Ranma read it.<br/>"Congratulations and best wishes for the future. Please<br/>forgive me for ruining a good dinner." At the bottom of the<br/>letter was just the symbol "i."<p>"Whoa," Ranma said, "now that's creepy."<p>Just about then, Ryoga finally showed up, having intended to<br/>go to the wedding, but getting mixed up and naturally<br/>ending up at the reception by mistake. After a few<br/>obligatory words of congratulations to Ranma and Akane,<br/>Akari-who had already been to the wedding and the<br/>reception-began pestering Ryoga.<p>Meanwhile, Shampoo appeared and produced the letter she had<br/>alluded to. "Here," she said, holding it out to him.<p>Ranma immediately read it, "Sorry I mixed up the glasses. I<br/>know the old saying, but I couldn't help myself. Is that<br/>wrong?" This one was signed "no."<p>Akane trembled and said, "I just got a shiver up my spine,<br/>but I'm not sure why."<p>"That was weird," Ranma remarked, giving the letter back.<br/>"I wonder what glasses it's referring to."<p>"Shampoo not know," Shampoo said, and promptly left the room<br/>again.<p>Just then, Ryoga appeared, and Ranma said, "Don't tell me<br/>you got one of those weird letters, too."<p>Ryoga said, "Now that you mention it, I was going to ask you<br/>about this..." Sure enough, Ryoga produced a letter.<p>All it said was, "I'm sorry." At the bottom, it was signed<br/>"ku."<p>Ranma thought about it for a moment, and then hit his hand<br/>in realization. "Of course! It's so obvious!"<p>"What?" Ryoga asked.<p>"The same person wrote all four of those letters!" Ranma<br/>declared, causing everyone to face-fault except Nabiki-who<br/>merely said:<p>"Well, duh."<p>THE END<br/>
