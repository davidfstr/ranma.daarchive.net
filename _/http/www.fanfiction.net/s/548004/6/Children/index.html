</div>Children: Chapter 6<p>Akama rushed into her room and closed the door lightly. She didn't want to get yelled at while her aunt was visiting. She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, and sighed, seeing the cosmetic counter saleslady's product still adorning her face. "You know, Akama, you do look very nice." A voice from behind her said. Akama turned around to see her mother, and it wouldn't be noticed through the shades of color on her cheeks, but Akama blushed.<p>"Aww, Mom..." Akama said, hearing the door close as she started to fumble with the zipper on the back of her dress. "Could ya help me with this, Mom?" Akama asked.<p>'Just be gentle, Akane. Help her with her dress, and ask her how it went.' Akane thought, moving around to carefully slide the zipper down on her daughter's garment. She watched as her daughter quickly re-dressed in a baggy pair of pants and a bright blue T-shirt. Akane pulled the chair out from the makeup table, and sat, crossing her legs as she folded her hands in her lap. "So... How did it go, Akama?" Akane said.<p>"Fine, I guess, Mom..." Akama said, rubbing at her face with a tissue.<p>"Is there anything you want to talk about with me, Dear?" Akane asked.<p>"Just how to get this stuff off my face, heh.." Akama said, chuckling nervously.<p>"Come with me, Akama." Akane said, smiling softly as she led her daughter to the bathroom. "So..." Akane started, trying to be less 'overbearing'. "Your sister and you had a nice time then?"<p>Reluctantly, Akama answered. "Yeah, it was pretty nice. One 'a Ranma's friends, that swimmer girl, was there. She came with us for a little bit. I was doin' good until Ranma came out of the dressing room in this tiny little pink dress. Why in the world does he have to be so... girly sometimes?" The mother and daughter pair ducked into the master bathroom, and Akane pulled out a small bottle of face cleanser from under the sink.<p>"I'm glad you had a nice time, Dear." Akane said, taking a washcloth and getting it wet. "Put some of this on your face." She said. Akama applied a bit of the creamy cleanser to her face, feeling it tingle as it acted on the cosmetics. As Akane began to wipe away the coloring, she answered her daughter's question. "He doesn't really *have* to be, Akama. That's just how he is. I'm actually happier he turned out like this, rather than how your father handled it."<p>"How'd dad deal with it? I mean, I've heard him talk about how he used to be..." Akama said, feeling her mother's gentle wiping on her face.<p>"Well, he used to act completely like you would expect an idiotic, stubborn, *boy* to act like. He hardly ever acted like he even acknowledged that he had this other body. I remember quite a few times that he would sleep in... revealing positions. He never wore anything that even resembled female clothing, unless he was absolutely forced to. For a long time, it was like he thought he could escape his curse by acting like it just wasn't there. To make it worse, he thought he could escape the times that he was forced to act ladylike, by acting even more like a stupid *boy.* He could be so arrogant, and rude, and just... Immature." Akane said, still going over her daughter's face.<p>"He sure doesn't act like that now, what happened?" Akama interrupted.<p>"I was just getting to that." Akane said.<p>"Oh... Sorry." Akama looked down, before her chin was lifted back up by her mother's hand.<p>"It's alright, Akama. You've always had more in common with your father, I understand. You're 'daddy's little girl', after all." Akane said.<p>"Hmph... I'm not a little girl, Mom." Akama said.<p>"It's just an expression, dear. Don't worry." Akane said, tossing the color stained washcloth in a laundry basket. "Anyway, What happened with your father was that he grew up."<p>"t know it had to be more than that, Mom. What do you mean?" Akama asked.<p>"I'm just trying to say that I think he just eventually had to deal with himself, and how he'd changed. Getting dunked in that spring was scary for him, not that he'd have admitted it then, and he'd probably be reluctant now. He had to adjust to being a girl half the time, in one moment. People normally have years to figure out how to handle themselves. For your father, it was like waking up a completely different person. All the things he'd known before were totally wrong for this new person he was, and he just needed a little time to grow into it. It's sad that he took such a bad route along the way though... We hated each other at first, you know." Akane said.<p>"What?" Akama asked, shocked. "But you and Dad... I mean... He loves you. He says it a hundred times a day, at least. It's not like I don't notice how he looks at you all goofy either, right before you two kiss each other in front of Ranma and I."<p>"Of course we love each other now, dear. Back then, however, it was totally different. We fought constantly." Akane said.<p>"Oh... Well, why'd you two fight?" Akama asked.<p>"There's not really a simple answer, Akama. It was a mix of things we both did, misunderstandings, pressure from our fathers, and other things." Akane said.<p>"So what's this got to do with why Ranma acts so girly, again?" Akama asked, blinking<p>"Well, your father tried to cover up the fact that he was cursed, by acting like he *wasn't* cursed. He kept trying to be even more of what he was told was manly, to avoid having to face his girl-form. He just ended up making things worse, though. Your brother, however, had a much better start. He didn't have all the pressure, and he had time to grow up with his curse instead of having it forced on him suddenly. Your brother is dealing with his curse by not trying to ignore that it's there. He's made a decision, somewhere along the way in his life that this other body he has is just as much a part of him as your body is a part of you. He really does act the same way in either form, if you look close enough." Akane said.<p>"Yeah... That is true, I mean, He's always nice to people, even when they aren't to him, and he's just as smart as a girl or a guy. He worries about how he looks, and laughs at the same stuff, whether he's a girl or a guy. I think I understand, Mom." Akama said.<p>"Akama, dear... How are *you* feeling about yourself? It's nice that you're thinking about your brother, but..." Akane paused, taking a deep breath, before continuing, "Your father told me about your dream."<p>"Aww, Mom... It was just a silly dream anyway. Didn't mean anything. I'm really doing fine." Akama said.<p>"That's not what your father thinks." Akane said.<p>"Dad's wrong then, Mom. I'm doing ok, really. I just had a weird dream. Dad and me had a little talk about it, I'm really ok." Akama said.<p>"Your father seemed to think you weren't happy with yourself. He told me that he thought you were worried about... Well, your femininity." Akane said.<p>"W-well... What if I am? I mean, everyone expects girls to be all frilly and cute and stuff. I'm just not like that, Mom. It's not like I can ever forget I'm a girl, either, I got this body, and... you know... my chest is getting bigger. And I've noticed my hands getting a lot smoother..." Akama trailed off, sighing.<p>"Akama, It's alright to be unhappy with yourself." Akane said.<p>"I'm supposed to be dad's heir, Mom. I'm supposed to carry on the school." Akama said. "How can I do that if I'm... weak?"<p>"Akama, you are *not* weak. " Akane said.<p>"Yeah, right, Mom. I can't even act like what a girl's supposed to without wanting to tear the stupid dress off, and throw those tiny little heeled shoes across the room. How am I supposed to be a good heir if I can't even do good at being a girl?" Akama asked.<p>"You don't have to act how everyone else thinks you should, Akama. How did you feel today while you were with your sister and her friend?" Akane said.<p>"It was... it was nice, I already told you. I liked spending time with Ranma, and I... sort of made friends with that swimmer girl Ranma likes. Her name's Taiiku. She really seems sweet, but we don't have anything in common really." Akama said.<p>"How'd you feel about how you looked, Akama? Uncomfortable?" Akane asked.<p>"Yeah... I mean, I felt weird. My legs were sort of cold, and the skirt kept brushing against them. The dress felt sort of nice though, a-around my chest... and my waist, it was like it clung to my body, but not tight, or anything, just... sort of comfortable." Akama sighed, fumbling for other words. A little bit of her told her to stop talking about this, that she was acting weak, not like she should. When she continued, her tone was a bit harsher. "Anyway, I feel much better now, this is much more my kind of outfit. It doesn't make me feel so silly like a dress does." Akama said.<p>Akane paused for a second, and started talking. "I think I understand, Akama. Tell me if I have this right. You enjoyed hanging out with your sister, and another girl your age."<p>"Yeah." Akama said, nodding<p>"You enjoyed how the dress made you feel like a girl, but you're more comfortable in pants and shirts." Akane said.<p>"Y-yeah..." Akama said.<p>"It's not like you hate being a girl, is it?" Akane asked.<p>"No... I mean, I certainly don't want to be a guy. That might make me a little stronger, but... Guys can act so stupid sometimes." Akama said. "Some girls act pretty stupid too, usually when they're talking about guys though, so they're the problem again, heh." Akama added.<p>"I see." Akane said.<p>"I just don't see why everyone expects me to be like all those other girls." Akama said.<p>"Everyone doesn't, Akama. People are all different, just because you're athletic and you're not into the same things..." Akane said, stopping as Akama interrupted.<p>"I know, I know, Dad said the same thing. Just because of how I am doesn't make me not a girl, right?" Akama asked. Her mother tried to say something, but Akama interrupted again. "And I'm just as good of a girl as any other girl my age, right?"<p>"Well, something like that, dear." Akane said. "You are a beautiful, talented, strong, graceful girl. Your father is still one of the most skilled martial artists in the world, and you're very close to being able to beat him. Anyone that takes one look at you could tell you were a girl. You're not going to be expected to be like every other girl in the world, Akama."<p>"I like... being a girl, mom. I think about... being a mom myself sometimes, and I want to be married someday too. I like practicing with dad, and studying the art. I like how I look in a dress, and girly clothes, but I like wearing the clothes that make me feel comfortable too. But I hear all this stuff saying that girls have to act a certain way, and wear certain things, and... Well, I'm just not like that." Akama said.<p>"Then don't be like that, Akama. You're a unique person. Your father and I have always been behind you, and we'll always love you, no matter what you wear, or do." Akane said.<p>"You.. So you really don't mind if I'm not like Aunt Kasumi or something? You always get so excited when you see me acting more like she does, all girly and delicate." Akama said.<p>"I get excited because I was a girl your age once too, you know. I dreamed of being a mother someday, and since it happened, I've been so happy. I can't help getting a little excited when I see my own daughter looking so nice. We were overjoyed when we found out we were going to have twins, Akama." Akane said. "We have always loved both of you, before you were even born."<p>"You really embarrass me sometimes though, mom. Why do you make it such a big deal when I put on a dress?" Akama asked.<p>Akane looked down, and sighed. "...I never had a mother to do that for me, Akama."<p>"Y-you... Didn't? I knew that Grandma died when you were a kid, how young were you, mom?" Akama asked, blinking.<p>"She was so sick, for so long... I don't know exactly how old I was when she died. I can hardly remember times when she *wasn't* sick. I knew she loved me, Akama. We just never got to do many of the things that mothers look forward to sharing with their daughters." Akane said. "She wouldn't have even had the energy to get excited."<p>"Oh, mom... I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't know you were just a little girl when grandma died. I thought you were older." Akama said.<p>"Well, now you know." Akane said.<p>"Yeah... Mom, I'm sorry." Akama moved to hug her mother tightly, letting a few tears slide down her cheek. "I never realized about grandma... If something happened, I would miss you so much."<p>"Even when I embarrass you?" Akane asked, feeling a few teardrops hit her shoulder, and dampen her shirt.<p>"Even then, Mom. I still feel like I'd rather wear this than some frilly dress, though. It's just not me." Akama said.<p>"I know, dear. I know. You have to be comfortable with yourself, to be happy." Akane said, pulling her daughter closer. A glance to the bathroom mirror showed two dark haired girls with many similarities in their looks. It was apparent in times like this, when the two could be seen side by side, that Akane noticed the most how much her daughter resembled her. Akane brought her hand up and swept through her daughter's reddish-tinted black hair slowly. "I love you, Akama. No matter what. Always remember that." Akane said.<p>"I... um... Love you too, Mom." Akama said. "If you ever run into that little girl again... You can tell her she grows up to be a great mother, ok?"<p>"It's a deal." Akane said, continuing her soft motions through her daughter's hair. The soft pink tint that flooded Akama's cheeks was an unspoken signal between mother and child, the two girls had shared something special today.<p>Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Ranma had fastened a white apron around herself, and she was eagerly helping her Aunt with the lunch preparations. "So what do you want me to do next, Aunt Kasumi?" Ranma asked, smiling. The red-haired girl's eyes were wide and sparkling, as she listened intently to every one of her Aunt's instructions.<p>Kasumi handed ingredients to Ranma, one at a time, before speaking up again. "You're a natural chef, Ranma. You're doing great!" Kasumi said.<p>"Thanks, Aunt Kasumi!" Ranma said, smile widening before she accidentally poured too much of the salt into the soup they were making. Ranma blushed brightly, but a few seconds later, she giggled and smiled. "Oops." Ranma said, still giggling.<p>Grinning, Kasumi patted Ranma's back comfortingly. "It's ok, Ranma. Just a little mistake. I've had a lot of practice with food accidents. Your mom *is* my sister." Kasumi said, starting to giggle along with her niece.<p>Akama and her mother came back into the kitchen shortly after, and they overheard the two laughing. "What's so funny, Sis?" Akama asked.<p>"Oh, nothing, Aunt Kasumi's trying to teach me some things about cooking..." Ranma said, grinning at Kasumi.<p>"Ranma is an excellent student." Kasumi said, grinning back to her niece.<p>"I have a feeling you two were doing more than cooking." Akane said, smiling at the way her daughter and sister seemed to be becoming friends. "Are you having a good time with your Aunt, Ranma?"<p>"Yeah, I am." Ranma said, stirring the soup slowly. "She's got a lot to teach me about cooking, it's complicated. All those measurements and different terms... It's fun though, when you've got a good instructor." Ranma said.<p>"Aunt Kasumi?" Akama asked.<p>"Yes, Akama?" Kasumi answered.<p>"Could I... Watch you two for a bit?" Akama said, folding her hands in front of herself.<p>"Why, Of course, Akama, you're welcome to stand around with the cooks in here for as long as you like." Kasumi said.<p>Akama walked into the kitchen, and slowly pulled on another white apron, fussing a bit at the frills around the edges. "Oh brother, this is a little much." Akama said.<p>Akane smiled, and stood still, taking in the scene for a little. It really was nice, having three of the most important people in her life standing together in the kitchen. She walked over and hugged her daughters lightly. "Listen to your Aunt, girls. I'm going to go see what your father is up to." Akane said.<p>"Alright, Mom." Ranma said.<p>"Yeah, ok." Akama said.<p>Akane smiled, and walked out of the back door, heading out to where she would be sure to find her husband. Akane slid the doors of the dojo open slowly, and Ranma turned. "Guess I never really did manage to be able to hide myself from you, Ranma. Not that I've wanted to for a while, though." Akane said.<p>"That's good to hear, Akane." Ranma said. "You might want to now though, I'm a bit smelly."<p>"That's alright, You are normally." Akane said, grinning as she teased her husband.<p>"Oh, really?" Ranma said, smiling a bit as he took deep breaths.<p>"Yeah. Really." Akane said, blushing a light shade at her husband's smile. She felt the warmth on the face, and thought, 'You can still make me blush, Ranma. Even after all these years.'<p>"Are the girls back yet?" Ranma asked.<p>"Yes, they're back." Akane said. "Kasumi came over too, you might want to poke your head out into reality some time and say hi. Her son came with her."<p>"I'll be in there in a little, Akane." Ranma said.<p>"There was something else I wanted to talk to you about, Ranma." Akane said<p>"Oh, What was that, Akane?" Ranma asked.<p>"I didn't *quite* make it as long as you suggested." Akane said.<p>"So you talked with Akama? How'd it go?" Ranma asked.<p>"It went... well, I suppose. She told me that she was feeling like she was weak, and failing you as an heir, by not being how everyone expects a girl to act. I think she's starting to mature a little, and notice that her body is... Changing in ways that won't let her forget that she doesn't act how people generally think is feminine. She did tell me that she had a good time with her sister, though, I'm so glad that they get along, Ranma. It makes me happy to see our children happy." Akane said. She purposefully withheld the small part about talking about losing her mother. She truly felt that it was something special, between a mother and daughter only. She didn't have a habit of lying to her husband, or leaving out parts of the truth, but this time she felt it necessary.<p>"Our daughter's not a little girl anymore, Akane... We have to deal with the fact that she's becoming a woman as much as she does. Did she say how she felt about her attire on the little trip?" Ranma asked.<p>"She said... You know, she said that she liked how the dress felt, and that she liked that she was a girl. She said that she was more comfortable wearing pants and shirts, things like that, though. I completely understood." Akane said.<p>"Yeah... dressing femininely can be a bit uncomfortable at times. Akama hasn't even had pantyhose on yet, either, I can't wait to hear what she has to say about that." Ranma said.<p>"My husband, the women's apparel specialist..." Akane said, grinning.<p>"Of course I am, dear. I'm Ranma Saotome. Specialist in everything." Ranma said, grinning right back.<p>"Sure, Ranma..." Akane said, chuckling. "Anyway, I tried to make sure she knew that we were behind her in whatever she chose to do. We have to do that, even if, however unlikely, she decides that she wants to act more like she thinks a young woman should act... and less like the little girl who wanted to be just like daddy."<p>"Akane, I'm not my father." Ranma said. "I won't put pressure on either of our children for the sake of my father's notions of 'carrying on the family line', or things like that. I love my children, no matter what."<p>"Just remember that, Ranma. Things can change very quickly." Akane said.<p>"I know." Ranma said.<p>Akane felt a light tap on her shoulder, and turned around to see her daughter holding the phone for her, with a hand over it, so the person on the other end couldn't hear. "Mom, it's for you. Someone from the school," Said the younger Ranma.<p>"Hello?" Akane said.<p>"Hello, Mrs. Saotome?" The voice on the other end said.<p>"Yes?" Akane said.<p>"I just wanted to let you know that your daughter will be expected to show up at swim practice tomorrow morning, an hour before school starts. Make sure she gets there, or she'll not be allowed to be on the team." The grumpy sounding woman said.<p>"Alright, Thank you for calling. I'll make sure she's there." Akane said.<p>"Who was that, Mom?" Ranma asked.<p>"I guess it must have been the swimming coach. You have practice tomorrow morning." Akane said.<p>"Hey, great!" Ranma said, enthusiastically. "Umm... Oh yeah! Aunt Kasumi said that lunch was ready, too. The phone rang when I was coming out here to tell you."<p>"Alright, Ranma. We'll be in soon." Akane said. She watched her daughter slip back out, and into the house, before turning back to face her husband again. "Are you as worried about this as I am?" Akane asked.<p>Ranma Sr. responded slowly, sighing. "It will be alright, Akane. Our daughter can handle herself well enough. If she's decided she would like to be on the swimming team, she's obviously thought about what that's going to entail."<p>"I just hope she knows what she's getting into, Ranma. Those other girls on that team won't very much like having... someone with our daughter's unique problems around them.' Akane said.<p>"She can handle herself, Akane..." Ranma Sr. said.<p>"I certainly hope so, Ranma. I certainly hope so." Akane said.
