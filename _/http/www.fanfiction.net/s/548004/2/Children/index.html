</div>Children : Chapter 2<p>Taiiku walked down the halls of the school, after leaving the bathroom. She was thinking to herself about Ranma, and her sister. "Wonder if her sister's cursed too... Guess it doesn't matter, they both seemed like nice girls. Akama seemed to be in a hurry to get home though, she said she was sparring, maybe she's in to martial arts. I'll have to ask." Deep in thought as she was, Taiiku barely noticed the wide eyed stares of the various boys staying to practice with the teams, nor their mutterings about her looks. Finally, she pushed open the doors to the large pool on the school grounds.<p>"What took you so long? You're late." The harsh female coach yelled at Taiiku, as she walked in.<p>"I'm sorry, it won't happen again." Taiiku said, taking her place over by the other swimmers. There was a rather expected buzz among the young women, but the coach soon silenced the group with a loud whistle blast.<p>"Alright, girls, get in the locker room and get changed!" The coach said, as the girls filed into the small room.<p>"So, Taiiku, what were you so late for?" One of the girls asked.<p>"I met this really sweet girl, and her sister, and I guess I just got caught up talking. It was pretty sad too, it seemed that noone even wanted to be around her, she was in the bathroom all by herself. I think if I hadn't come in there, she'd have been crying." Taiiku said. "Why do you care anyways, Yuki?"<p>"Just wondering... Tell me, this girl's name wasn't 'Ranma', Was it?" Yuki asked, frowning.<p>"Yeah, it was, why? You know her?" Taiiku said.<p>"Everyone knows *her*." Yuki said, placing obvious emphasis on the gender designation. "She's not even really a girl. 'She' is just some boy who claims to have a 'curse'. He didn't try to look at you while you changed or anything, did he?" Not allowing Taiiku to answer, Yuki continued. "Just stay away from that pervert, ok? It's bad enough he tries to come in our bathroom, and our locker room, he even goes so far as to make up this whole crazy story, and wear the girl's uniform. What self-respecting guy puts on *lipstick* just to get a peek at one of us?"<p>By now, Taiiku was sighing heavily, seeing the proof that what Ranma had said was true. The girls, atleast these girls, did all have it in for her. "Be quiet, Yuki. Ranma is a very nice person who's had to deal with changing back and forth like that since he was born. I think it's terrible that all of you can't be a little more understanding. He never did anything that was even remotely rude around me, He seemed shy, actually, probably because he hasn't got a friend in the world. He's cute, funny, sweet, and now that I see how hard you all make it, it's a wonder he keeps such a good outlook." Taiiku had an expression of disgust on her face by this point, and Yuki was shrinking back. "Maybe if you looked past the surface once in a while, you'd be suprised." Taiiku said, before standing up on the bench in the locker room, girls in various states of dress or undress looking squarely at her as she shouted. "Hey! I just learned that you've all been picking on this friend of mine." Taiiku knew it was 'socially risky' to do something like this, but she went on anyways, leveraging her popularity as an athlete for her cause. "Her name's Ranma Saotome. I heard that you, and the other girls in school have been calling her a pervert, simply because she wants to use the restroom. I know about her curse. I really don't want to hear about any more of this. She's a friend of mine, and instead of making her feel terrible, I hope you guys will be nice to her, or at the very least, let her use the restroom, and change, in peace."<p>A hush fell over the group of girls, as they all pulled on their swimsuits. Finally, one of them spoke up. "So... She's really.. Cursed?" The girl asked.<p>"Yes. She showed me. The worst thing is, the guys pick on him even worse than you do. He *can't* go in the guys locker room, because they know how to trigger the change, and all *they* want is to stare at a girl naked. They know all of you would scream, or kick them in the crotch, but not Ranma. Just be a little nicer to the poor girl, she's got enough problems. Besides, that sister of hers looks pretty dangerous, And I sure don't want to make her mad, do you?" All the girls shook their heads, knowing Akama's reputation.<p>Yuki spoke up, looking at Taiiku. "Hey, I'm sorry. I don't know what the other girls are gonna do, but I believe you. Ranma's gonna have atleast two friends, that's for sure. Besides, his guy side is pretty cute..." Yuki giggled a bit, as the girls started heading for the door.<p>"Just what I was thinking." Taiiku said.<p>Meanwhile, Ranma and Akama were on their way home. Akama was walking along the fence again, laughing to herself at how much her balance was improving. Ranma was blushing, from when she turned her head to the side, and caught a short glimpse of her sister's underwear as the skirt of the uniform fluttered in the wind. "Sis, come on, get down from there. Anyone could look straight up your skirt with no problem at all." Ranma said.<p>"I toldya this morning, Sis. If anyone tries, I'll beat 'em up." Akama's voice had a certain sense of assurance. She was quite certain that she could take anyone that'd even try to be so gross.<p>"I didn't even have to try, Sis. I just looked over to talk to you and the wind blew your skirt up." Ranma's blush deepened. "And ask me next time you borrow my undies, ok?" Ranma smirked, as Akama hopped down off the fence.<p>"Just another reason I hate these stupid things..." Akama sighed, then started smirking like her sister. "I can't believe you looked up my skirt, Ranma." Akama said, teasingly.<p>"I didn't have to look. I just turned my head." Ranma said, teasing back. "I wonder sometimes if you don't want some guy to sneak up and plant a big kiss on you, what with the way you act."<p>"Hey!" Akama screeched, "Maybe that's what *you* want, girlie."<p>"Nope. You on the other hand.." Ranma giggled, making her voice as deep as she could in her female form. Unfortunately, it was still a sweet, melodic, undeniably feminine tone. "Oh, Akama, You're so pretty! Let me kiss you!" Ranma broke into laugher, making kissy faces at her sister.<p>"Cut it out, Ranma. You know you don't count." Akama grinned widely, putting her arm over her sister's shoulder. "You're not a guy."<p>This time, it was Ranma who squealed, "Hey! I am too... Just not right now. So ha." She said.<p>Akama let herself laugh a little, as they continued on their way home. Absorbed in her apparent victory in the sibling teasing wars, Akama never noticed the smirk on her sister's face. Ranma kissed her sister square on the cheek, leaving a bright pink lip print. "Ok, ok, you got me." Akama said, wiping at her face.<p>"Sure did. I win." Ranma said, laughing and gloating. Unfortunately, her victory was short lived, as soon she received a kiss on her cheek, from Akama.<p>"Love ya sis. But I win." Akama said, grinning, as they turned the corner to their house. A few more steps, and they were home.<p>"Hey, you two." Akane said, standing at the door. "How was school today?"<p>"Pretty good." Akama said. "Can't wait to get this stupid thing off though, ugh, skirts.." She trailed off as she headed into her room.<p>"And what about you, Ranma?" Akane said, watching her daughter take a seat on the couch and cross her legs.<p>"School was fine, just like normal, everyone teased me. I had lunch with Akama, then after school I met this really nice girl named Taiiku. She's a swimmer." Ranma said, smiling, tugging on her skirt a bit.<p>"That's wonderful, Ranma. I'm glad to see you making some friends." Akane said. Just then, Akama came by, heading out to spar with her father.<p>"He's out back, right?" Akama asked. Her mother just nodded, and Akama rushed out the back door.<p>"Mom?" Ranma spoke up shyly. "I really need to talk to you... It's important. Something happened yesterday at school that I didn't tell you."<p>Akane's facial expression turned worried, and she sat down on the couch next to Ranma. Akane put one arm around Ranma's shoulders, while Akane's other hand rested on Ranma's shoulder. Plainly, Akane asked, "What is it, Ranma?"<p>"I think... Well, I'm pretty sure.. That I had my first period yesterday." Ranma answered, uncrossing her legs, and burying her head in her hands. "I don't know what to do, mom. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, I was just so embarassed."<p>"Oh, Ranma... I'm so sorry, I should have seen this coming. You spend much more time as a girl than your father does, I should have known..." Akane said, pulling Ranma close. "It'll be alright, Ranma. Every girl goes through this at some time in their lives. It's a natural thing." Akane was cut off by her distraught daughter.<p>"But I'm *not* a girl, mom." Ranma sobbed, her voice dropping, "Not a guy either..."<p>"Ranma... You're a very beautiful, sweet, girl. You're just going through a normal part of a girl's life. I'm sure you've started to notice... certain things in your guy form too. How pretty all those girls at your school are, how your voice is starting to get a little deeper... It's all normal for growing up. You have me and your father both, to help you. Don't be scared, we're not going to let anything happen to you, and I promise it'll be ok, alright? I think you should talk to your father after he's done training with your sister." Akane smiled, holding her daughter's shaking hand.<p>"It was... so... gross, Mom. Seeing that blood there. Is that normal? Should I have been bleeding from... There?" Ranma asked, shaking still, but less with her mother's comforting grasp around her hand.<p>"Yes, it's perfectly normal, dear." Akane said, continuing to explain the details behind a woman's monthly cycle. "I don't know if it'll be different for you, since you aren't a girl all day, every day. My best guess is that it might be stretched out some, although, it could still happen no matter what, right on schedule. Provided you're a girl when it's that time."<p>"I found that stuff under the cabinet, Mom..." Ranma said, embarassedly.<p>"Great. We can skip that part then, hmm? You're a smart girl, so I imagine you can figure it out. Don't hesitate to ask me if you need any help, Ranma." Akane said. "Ranma, you know that you can get pregnant now, don't you?" A serious mood fell over the room.<p>"Yeah. I know." Ranma said, a knot forming in her stomach. She didn't plan to ever be pregnant, really, but then she didn't expect that her dad ever expected to be either.<p>"Ranma, I just want to say this to you. If you do happen to... Your father and I will never stop loving you, no matter what happens. Alright?" Akane said, looking at her daughter.<p>"Ok, Mom. I understand." Ranma said, fiddling with her shirt. "I.. um.. Really need to go get changed, Mom. Thanks." Ranma hugged her mother tightly, and a few tears fell on her mother's sleeve. Then Ranma got up and went in her room, pulling off her uniform and hanging it up. She looked at herself in the mirror for a few seconds, and ran her hands down her body. 'I feel so... Soft.' She thought. 'I really do need to talk to dad.' Ranma pulled a pair of loose blue shorts from her drawers, and took a baby blue t-shirt from her closet. She put both of the garments on, and fluffed her hair out of the collar. Smiling into the mirror, she suddenly thought of Taiiku. 'She was really pretty... And I almost thought she was interested in me. Well, not this me, but my guy side. I am attracted to girls, and I've always thought I was going to be a husband someday, rather than a wife... Man, I wish Dad would hurry up...' Ranma's thoughts wandered, then they were interrupted by Akama coming down the hall and heading to her room, bragging. She'd gotten closer than ever to beating her father, even though he still won.<p>"Yes! I'm gettin' closer and closer... One of these days, pops!" Akama yelled, as she grabbed a change of clothes from her room, and headed to the bathroom that Ranma and Akama shared.<p>"You did very well today, Akama. I'm proud of you." Ranma Sr. said. He headed into the master bathroom, inside the master bedroom, but was stopped by his daughter tugging at his shirt. "Hm, Oh, Ranma. Hi, honey. How was your day?"<p>"Great, dad." She stood up on her toes, and kissed his cheek. "Thanks for that note in my lunch... It really cheered me up." Ranma said.<p>Ranma Sr. replied, "I'm glad you had a nice day dear. I'm really sweaty from working out though, mind if I go take a bath?"<p>"Of course not, Dad." Ranma said, "I need to talk to you after you're done though. It's... really important."<p>"Alright, Ranma." Ranma Sr. said, and disappeared into the bathroom.<p>Akane was busily cleaning up the living room, picking up little pieces of trash left around the house carelessly, but her mind was somewhere else. She was worrying intensely about Ranma. 'She's so confused... Doesn't even know who she is. She does seem to lean more to the feminine side, but then again, she always reacts so harsh when her sister teases her. Well, I think she's going to talk to her father, that's the best thing I know.'<p>Ranma was laying on her bed, sniffling. "This sucks." She moaned, to noone in particular. Staring up at her fan, with her hands behind her head, her mind got carried away to a possible future where she was wearing a bright white wedding gown. "It seems nice..." Ranma said, picturing it in her mind. "But do I really want to be a bride? Is that really me?" Another image of the future popped into her head, one of Ranma in an elaborate tuxedo, staring down the aisle at a bride. 'Why.. why do I like this more? I feel more comfortable seeing myself like this...' Ranma thought.<p>A knocking noise caused Ranma to look over. Her dad was standing there, clean clothes on from the shower, hair still slightly messed. "You wanted to talk to me, Ranma?" Ranma Sr. said.<p>"Yeah, Dad... I need to talk to you about... me." Ranma patted the space beside her on her bed. "Come sit down, dad, please?"<p>"Alright, dear." Ranma Sr. moved over, and sat down on the bed beside his daughter.<p>"Dad... I had my first period yesterday. Before you say anything, I've already talked with Mom about it, that's not what I wanted." Ranma took a deep breath, and continued, "It made me think... more than I had already. Who am I? I don't look much like a guy, but.. I really don't feel like a girl. Most of the time when I'm a guy, it's the other way around, too. I'm just confused... Then at school today, I found out this girl had been watching my guy side for a while. She said that he was really cute, and she'd love to meet him. So... I let her. I think she took it ok, but that just made it worse. She didn't seem to mind if I was cursed, because she saw me first as a guy, so that's how she thought of me... But I don't know how to think of myself."<p>Ranma Sr. helped his daughter sit up, then he wrapped his arms around her, hugging her close. "Ranma... You're a very unique person. I can't tell you how to see yourself. Maybe you're not a guy or a girl. Maybe you're both. You don't stare at guys and obsess over your looks like some girls do, but then again, you're not really interested in athletics or martial arts, like a lot of guys are. Maybe, just maybe, you're so special that you get to be whoever you want, and just happen to get to look the part." He said.<p>"Dad... I know I'm different, there's no reason to try and make me feel special. I know that I'm cursed forever. I asked Akama if she was a guy or a girl, and even though she acts so different from all the other girls, she said, right away, that she was a girl. She knows exactly who she is. I feel like I don't.' Ranma said, sighing heavily. "The worst part is, I'm starting to get interested in... girls. I think it'd be nice to have a girlfriend to go out on dates with, but that doesn't make me a guy or a girl either..."<p>"That girl you met today, Ranma." Ranma Sr. said, "Was she friendly to you?"<p>"Yeah, Dad." Ranma answered. "She was great, said something about how I was born like this, and I couldn't have had any way of knowing it. I even think she might have made herself late to practice trying to cheer me up, when I told her how the guys and the girls usually pick on me."<p>Ranma Sr. smiled. He had an idea. "She knew who you were, Ranma. She saw past what was infront of her, and she saw to the sweet, caring, intelligent person underneath. So you're in a dress today, and a suit tomorrow, you're still the same person underneath. Your looks can't change who you are. I had to have your mom teach me that, and now I'm passing it on to you. No matter what you look like, the people that are really important will be able to see past that, and see you." He said. "Plus, it sort of sounds like she had a crush on you, Ranma." Ranma Sr. smirked, and went into a mock of Soun's crying fits, minus waterworks. "My daughter's a heartbreaker! Women and men alike fall at her beauty!" Ranma Sr. could hear the happy giggles coming from his daughter, and he knew she'd gotten the point.<p>"Oh, stop that, dad... You're just being silly." Ranma said, smiling and laughing. "She's on the swimming team, you know... And I do like to swim... Maybe if I signed up, I'd make more friends. Even if I didn't, I'd get to spend time with the one I have, right?"<p>"Sounds like an excellent plan to me, Ranma. Those pools aren't that warm though. It's a girls' team, right?" Ranma Sr. said.<p>"Of course, dad.. I'd look silly in a bikini as a guy, anyways." Ranma said, smirking.<p>"I'm almost positive they don't let you wear bikinis." Ranma Sr. said, smirking back. "Do you know where your sister went, Ranma? I just thought of something I want to show to the two of you."<p>"I think she went to take a bath after you two were done sparring." Ranma said. "She should be out by now though, why don't you go knock on her door?"<p>"Alright, Ranma. So, do you feel better about life now, my daughter?" Ranma asked.<p>"Yeah, I guess so, dad. I mean, I know I'm the same person no matter what I look like. I just don't think anyone else knows." Ranma said.<p>"You get on that swimming team and show them, alright? Everyone's gonna see how wonderful my little girl is." Ranma Sr. said, hugging his daughter closely, kissing her forehead gently.<p>"Aww, dad..." Ranma said, obviously embarassed. "I'm not your little girl, I'm almost 16!"<p>"Don't kid yourself, dear. You are always going to be my little girl. Your sister too. You're stuck." Ranma Sr. said, grinning.<p>"Oh brother." Ranma said, grinning, before she kissed her father on his cheek. "Guess I better get used to it then."<p>"Yup. Might as well." Ranma Sr. said, getting up, and going across the hall to Akama's room. He knocked on the door several times, and finally Akama's head poked out the door.<p>"Yeah? What's up, Dad?" Akama said.<p>"Come out here, please, I have something that I want to show the two of you." Ranma Sr. said.<p>Akama opened the door the rest of the way, revealing her usual attire of baggy shorts and a men's t-shirt. "Comin' dad." Akama said, and she walked into the hall.<p>Ranma jumped up, ponytail bouncing, and walked to the hall as well. Their father then led them into his room, where he took out a somewhat big box from under the bed. He spoke up, looking at Akama. "Akama, since you've been coming along so well in your lessons, I've decided to give this to you." Ranma Sr. said, pulling the lid off the box. Inside the box, seemingly perfectly preserved, was the outfit that Ranma Sr. used to wear exclusively, Red silk shirt with golden latches, black baggy pants. Akama's eyes went wide as she took the garments in her arms.<p>"Dad... You bein' serious 'bout this?" Akama asked, holding the clothes as if they were the most valuable object in the world, absolutely priceless. "I mean, this is your old uniform... I don't deserve it, you fought so many people wearin' this, I can only imagine the stories." She said.<p>"Remind me to tell you some of the stories sometime, Akama. For now, I say you do deserve it. I want you to have this outfit, it's been very special to me, and I know it'll be special to you too." Ranma Sr. said.<p>"Thanks, Dad." Akama said, running her fingers over the material of the shirt. "I'm gonna go try it on!" With that, she practically ran into her room, to change.<p>"While your sister's busy, I'll show you what I wanted to show you, Ranma." Ranma Sr. went to the closet, and opened it, pushing back rows of clothing. He finally came to the object of his search, a green jacket, hanging on a hanger, over a women's white dress shirt. A red tie hung around the neck, although it was more of a school uniform-ish tie, split into two short tails. Under the shirt, clipped to the hanger, although somewhat hidden, was a solid green skirt. "I want to give this outfit to you, Ranma. I was going through the closet a few days ago, and saw this. Normally I would have just kept it, but I'm afraid I've gotten a little big for it. There's a few other things, as well." Ranma Sr. said, pulling out the hanger, and a box with tall brown boots. "I think it's only appropriate to celebrate such an occasion as you had yesterday, with a little present, don't you? You really aren't my little girl anymore, you're becoming a woman right before my eyes. Not to mention how much your other side is maturing. Getting girls already... Just promise me you won't break too many hearts, Ranma."<p>"Can't promise anything, Dad. You know how us Saotomes are." Ranma said, grinning. Ranma turned to look at the hanger, then to the box. She opened it carefully, and looked at the boots, smiling. "They're huge, dad. They'll probably come up to my knees atleast. This little shoelaces at the top seems kind of pointless, but I suppose it'll be cute when I tie them into bows." Ranma said. She looked in the box, and there was one more item. Pulling out the extra item, Ranma saw that it was two very, very tall green socks, with a stitched band at the top. The socks would easily come up close to where the skirt would end. "Wow. Big socks." Ranma said, laughing a bit.<p>"Do you like it, Ranma?" Ranma Sr. asked.<p>"Yeah, it's a really nice outfit, dad. It looks great. I might have some trouble getting used to those huge boots, though. The brown looks nice with the green, so I might just deal with it." Ranma smiled, and gathered up the clothes, heading into her room to change as well. "Be right back, dad!" Ranma said.<p>It seemed that almost as soon as Ranma left, Akama came back in. "Not to sound ungrateful, dad... But these pants are a little big. And the shirt's sort of big too." She said.<p>"Of course.. I wore that when I was a guy, mostly, I think I forgot to give you something." Ranma Sr. said. He reached under the bed again, and pulled out a small bag with white linen ties, and one large black one. "Let me see if this will work." Ranma Sr. said, tying the large black tie around Akama's waist, catching the shirt and the pants together. He then took two of the white ties, and put them around Akama's ankles, ensuring that the pants would be comfortable, but not fall off. "There you go, Akama. Should be much better now." Ranma Sr. said.<p>"Hey, it is better. Thanks, Dad!" Akama said, quickly kissing her father's cheek, before blushing. "Love ya... pops." She whispered, then she went outside to practice by herself in the new outfit.<p>Ranma knocked lightly on the door, to make her dad turn around. Ranma Sr.'s eyes widened considerably as he looked to his daughter. She had changed into the outfit, and let her hair out of it's usual ponytail, letting it spill down her shoulders and back like a crimson tidal wave. "Well, what do you think?" Ranma asked, shifting around in the uncomfortable boots, hand resting on her hip in a cute pose.<p>"You're absolutely gorgeous, Ranma. I can't believe I could have one wonderful daughter, much less two. You look so much like me when I was younger, yet I still can't help seeing your mother's fire in you." Ranma Sr. was smiling broadly, purely out of love and pride.<p>"Dad..." Ranma whined, cheeks flooded with pink. "You're embarassing me..."<p>"I'm sorry, Ranma." Ranma Sr. said.<p>"I do really look pretty, don't I?" Ranma asked.<p>"You do, Ranma." Her father answered, "You look wonderful."
