</div>Children: Chapter 9<p>Ranma's eyes drifted open slowly, as the rays of sunlight invaded her room. The realization that she was a girl at the moment slowly came to the front of her mind."Just great." Ranma sighed. Looking over at the clock, she noticed that it was just before the time she would have had to get up for swimming practice.<p>"Ranma? Are you awake, dear?" Akane asked, peeking her head into her daughter's room.<p>"Yeah, I'm awake. I'm not going to swimming though. I quit." Ranma said.<p>Akane stepped into her daughter's room, and sat down on the edge of the bed. "Ranma, you just started yesterday. What's wrong?" Akane asked.<p>"Nothing, it's just that the whole swimming thing was to get closer to Taiiku. We're going out, so I can quit." Ranma answered.<p>"Oh, I see... So nothing happened with the other girls, or anything like that?" Akane asked.<p>"Nope. Nothing." Ranma immediately answered, very nearly cutting her mother off. It was painfully obvious that Ranma was lying, however, Akane decided not to pry too far into it.<p>'Ranma's father might be better suited to handle it, anyways.' Akane thought.<p>"Alright, dear." Akane said. "Might as well just get up and get ready. Which uniform would you like me to get out for you?"<p>Ranma groaned, trying to bury herself back into her bed. "Skirt." Ranma said. She was very reluctant to get out from underneath the fluffy blankets, and getting up to heat water would definitely remove her from those blankets.<p>"Alright, Ranma. Come on, now, get up." Akane said, going to her daugher's closet to retrieve the female version of the school's uniform. Akane pulled the hanger that held the blue and white outfit out of the closet, setting it on the bed.<p>"Mmm... In a little." Ranma mumbled.<p>Akane smiled and kissed her daughter's cheek. "I love you, Ranma. You need to get up now, not in a little, though." Akane said.<p>Ranma turned over, flashing the patented Saotome smile to her mother. If this didn't work, she might actually have to get up. "Pleeeeeeeease?" Ranma begged.<p>"Oh brother..." Akane said, laughing as she placed another kiss on her daughter's cheek. "I guess a few more minutes would be alright."<p>Ranma smiled even brighter, and snuggled back under the covers, clinging to their fuzzy warmth. "Thanks Mom!" Ranma said, muffled by pillows and blankets.<p>"You're welcome, Ranma." Akane said, walking out of her daughter's room. 'She really is her father's daughter...' Akane thought. As Akane walked by the window, she could see two shadows moving out in the back yard. "They're starting early today..." Akane said, to herself.<p>"Come on, old man. You're getting slow!" Akama taunted, as she stood across from her father.<p>"Oh, I'm getting slow..." Ranma Sr. said, grinning. He then rushed towards his daughter and swung his leg low, in an attempt to knock her off of her feet.<p>Akama jumped slightly, so that her father's leg would pass under her, harmlessly. She landed, and giggled. "Yup. Slow." Akama said.<p>Ranma smiled, and walked over to grab a towel. He threw one to his daughter, before wiping the sweat from his forehead. "You're getting a lot better, Akama. I'm proud of you." Ranma Sr. said.<p>"Thanks, Dad." Akama said, wiping at her forehead. She sighed heavily, before looking back over at him again, saying, "Dad... I love you." She walked over and gave him an enthusiastic hug, cheeks tinted pink as she looked up.<p>"I love you too, Akama. You did great today." Ranma smiled brighter, hugging his daughter closely. He did wonder what would bring up this sudden outburst, however.<p>"Let's go get cleaned up, huh, dad?" Akama said, turning around. She looked back over her shoulder, and winked. "Unless you want to let me beat you up some more, Old man."<p>"No, no," Ranma said, "I think you've got me worn out for this morning, Akama." He smiled again to his daughter, and walked into the house with her. Akama went off to the shower, but Ranma caught his wife in the kitchen.<p>"Ranma, Dear, You smell." Akane said, grinning widely as she fixed the kids' lunches.<p>"I know." Ranma said back, hugging his wife lightly.<p>"Oh, Ranma..." Akane blushed, feeling light kisses being pressed to her neck and cheek. "Really, I have to fix these. Go get your *other* daughter out of bed, hmm?"<p>"Shouldn't she be at swimming practice?" Ranma asked, blinking.<p>"I think something happened with the other girls, Ranma..." Akane said. She took a deep breath, and closed her eyes, laying her head on his shoulder. "She said she didn't want to go. I just couldn't bring myself to force her... She knows my weakness, anyways. One big smile and I was finished." Akane said.<p>"Oh, one of these?" Ranma stepped back, and smiled widely, blinking slowly.<p>"Exactly." Akane said, blushing. How did he always manage to do that to her?<p>"I'll get her up, and talk to her a bit." Ranma placed a light kiss on his wife's forehead, then moved to his son's room.<p>Ranma Jr. heard the light knocks on her door, and sighed. The knocking continued, so she had to get up out of bed and put on her robe. She walked to the door, and opened it. "I'm up... I'm up." She said.<p>"Good." Ranma Sr. smiled brightly. "Time to get ready for school, Ranma."<p>"I know..." Ranma Jr. said, feeling very unwilling to go to school on this particular day. She knew her father would pick up on this, so she moved back to her bed, and sat on the edge. She saw her father follow close behind.<p>"Ranma... I'm not going to ask you about what happened." Ranma Sr. smiled.<p>"Thanks dad..." Ranma Jr. said, knowing that even though his father wouldn't force him to discuss it, it was something she could do with him, better than anyone else. "The swimming team girls... They all hated me. They all... stared at me. I can't go back there."<p>Ranma Sr. put his arm around his daughter's shoulder, pulling her into a comforting embrace. "Ranma, I'm not going to make you. My dad pushed me all the time. You are your own person, and you have to make your own choices."<p>Ranma Jr. smiled lightly, messing with the bottom fringe of her nightgown. Her smile faded just as soon, however, when the thoughts came right back to her. "Dad... I'm a guy. I know... But I'm a girl too... It's just hard to figure everything out."<p>"I know, Ranma. You're doing a lot better than I did, I'm so proud of you. It is hard, but you always have me and your mom to help, whenever it gets overwhelming." Ranma Sr. said, hearing the bathroom door open. "I think you should just get ready and go to school, it'll get your mind onto something else. I've got to go get a bath, i'm stinking up the whole house." Ranma Sr. grinned, as he stood.<p>"Thanks, Dad." Ranma Jr. smiled, as she rose as well. Once her father had left, and the door was closed, she pulled off her nightgown, standing infront of the mirror to look at herself. 'Man, Ranma... You really can't deny you're a girl. You're even a really good looking one. Like dad said though, you're doing great, better than him,' She thought. "He's right, I just need to get ready and go to school." She said. Ranma got dressed in her uniform, then went out to the kitchen.<p>"My daughter..." Akane said, smiling brightly.<p>"Aww, Mom." Ranma blushed, sitting at the table. Akama walked in shortly after, dressed similarly in her uniform.<p>"My daughter..." Akane said again, smiling even brighter.<p>"Is there an echo in here?" Ranma Jr. asked, giggling.<p>"I think there is, sis. I heard her say it to you too." Akama said, grinning as she sat.<p>"Oh, you two, be quiet." Akane smiled, giving them their breakfast. Both Ranma and Akama ate fairly quickly, being as they were running out of time somewhat. After eating, they both got up and started to school.<p>Walking along the sidewalk, Ranma looked over at her sister. Blinking, she looked closer. "Akama... What's that on your face?" Ranma asked, very confused.<p>"What, I can't wear a little makeup to school?" Akama said. The bright blush that was drawn to her cheeks was somewhat hidden by said makeup.<p>"No, no... Of course you can... But why did you? This really doesn't seem like you, Akama." Ranma blinked again, now getting worried about her sister. Ranma did sometimes wish her sister would act a little more feminine, but it was surprising that her sister would change this quickly.<p>"So I'm changing what's 'me', Ranma. I could still kick your butt, and anyone else that has a problem with it, so just leave me alone with my lipstick, alright?" Akama grinned widely. "Ranma, I know you're just worried about me. Sisters are supposed to do that, right?"<p>"Yeah, brothers too." Ranma said. "I am just worried about you, sis. You seem to be jumping from one side of the scale to the other really quick, is all."<p>Akama smiled, patting her sister's shoulder. "Ranma, you'll be the first person I come to if I need anything, ok? Don't worry so much, you're gonna pop a blood vessel."<p>"Heh.. That sounds painful." Ranma said. They finally got to the school, and Ranma spotted Taiiku out of the corner of her eye. Ranma blushed brightly, her current gender and attire brought to the front of her mind. 'I can't let her see me... I don't know what she'll think...' Ranma thought. She said goodbye to her sister, and slipped off to her class.<p>Taiiku noticed Ranma, and smiled, starting to go over to her. Taiiku's smile quickly faded as she saw Ranma walk by hurriedly and slip into the school. 'Guess she didn't see me.' Taiiku thought. 'She looks very pretty today, I'll have to remember to tell her.'<p>Ranma looked back through the shaded windows of the school, seeing Taiiku walk away. 'Just get to class, Ranma. Get your mind on something else.' She thought. Classes went fairly normally for Ranma, she listened intently to the teacher, and eventually the lunch bell rang. Ranma walked out of the class slightly after everyone.<p>Taiiku came down the hall, chatting with a few friends. In the distance, a flash of red crossed her field of vision. Ranma had to have seen her this time, they were looking straight at each other. "Ranma! Hi!" Taiiku yelled, smiling. The only reply she recieved was a sad, worried smile, as Ranma turned and walked away quickly.<p>'I just can't... We kissed, and... I just can't. Until I can stand myself, I can't have Taiiku see me.' Ranma thought. She walked out and sat by a tree a bit farther off than her usual one, sighing as she opened her lunch. A small note was inside, that read, 'I'm proud of you, Ranma. Love, Akane.' Ranma sighed, and tucked the note back in.<p>"This is really getting weird." Taiiku said. "I have to find Ranma and see what this is about."<p>Ranma hardly noticed it, but as she was lost in her own thoughts, a figure approached her. It was Taiiku, and now there was nowhere Ranma could go. "Hi... T-Taiiku." Ranma stuttered weakly.<p>"Hi, Ranma." Taiiku answered, taking a seat on the grass. She pulled her legs close to her, and sighed. "Ranma, What's wrong? Did I do something?" Uncomfortable minutes passed as Ranma sat in silence. "Just talk to me, Ranma!" Taiiku said, calming down considerably before adding, "Please."<p>"I like you." Ranma said, pulling her legs close to herself as well.<p>"I like you too, Ranma. What's that have to do with this?" Taiiku asked, blinking.<p>"Don't you see? I'm a girl. Not just some guy that's cursed, like my dad, I'm a girl. Sometimes more of a girl than a guy... Don't you feel weird?" Ranma responded.<p>"Well, why would I? You're a guy a lot of the time, you were born a guy from what I know, and beside that, Ranma... Guy or girl, I really like you. It's you... I mean, not clothes, or makeup, or your body.. You."<p>"B-but... I'm a guy... and look at me. Wearing a skirt, and... and..." Ranma said, as she shifted in the feminine garments. "I'm a guy. You're a girl. It's supposed to just be simple. It's never been simple for me though. I like being a guy, I absolutely loved our date... But when I got home from it, I was a girl, and I saw my toenails... They looked so blank, and I wanted to paint them. It's sad, isn't it?" Ranma said.<p>Taiiku sat there through what Ranma had to say, listening closely. When Ranma had finished, she smiled and spoke up. "It's not sad, if my toenails had been looking bad, I would have wanted to paint them too. There's nothing wrong with you, Ranma. You're a normal girl." Taiiku grinned a little, "You just happen to be a normal guy too. I'm glad you are, too... I'm really fond of him."<p>Ranma's cheeks slowly filled with a light pink blush, and the bit of warmth that came with it, causing her to turn away. "You're too nice to me. I've.. not ever really had friends to begin with, much less friends that i was..." Ranma scratched her head softly, seeming to be searching for the right words. "Attracted to." She sighed, before continuing, "I can't figure out what makes you different, Taiiku. I like it, but i can't figure it out."<p>"Must be the unique specialness that is me, Ranma. No other possibility." Taiiku said, winking, in an effort to cheer her companion a bit.<p>Ranma smiled softly, before sighing again. "I just don't know... i'm getting so many confusing feelings lately. I'm sorry i avoided you today, Taiiku."<p>Taiiku smiled back, and hugged Ranma lightly, with one arm around Ranma's back. "It's alright. You had me worried, though. Talk to me when something's bothering you, silly." Taiiku said.<p>"I'll try." Ranma said, her mood brightening very noticeably with the small embrace, "I'm not used to this though... I mean, having friends."<p>"I can tell, Ranma... But don't worry, i don't bite." Taiiku said, grinning slightly<p>"Better not." Ranma said, "Or i'll have to bite back." Ranma said.<p>The two of them ate their lunches together, then went back inside for the rest of their day.
