</div>Warning! Amatch-ur write-ur! Second Chapter Ev-ur! Warning!<p>Rated PG-13 for the occasional swearing.<p>Disclaimer : The characters used in this fanfiction do not belong to<br/>me, and are used without permission for non-profit purposes.<p>NOTE: To avoid confusion, I have decided to use a certain fanfic<br/>convention, where 'chi' is used to refer to a person's own life<br/>energy, while 'ki' refers to ambient life energy. Thus, your chi would<br/>be my ki, and vice versa. Hope that clears it up.<p>Comments? Suggestions? Love it? Hate it? Why do you love it? Why do<br/>you hate it? Email me at bluefurball(at) Flames<br/>will be ignored.<p>When Bakas Learn<br/>by bluefurball<p>Chapter 1<p>For the fourteenth time in ten minutes, Saotome Ranma gave a silent<br/>"thank you" to Kami-sama for the fact that his new-found skills<br/>required conscious effort.<p>He quietly accepted the bowl of rice offered to him by Kasumi, all the<br/>while keeping his eyes on the on the table, not daring to look<br/>up. More specifically, not daring to look to his right, where Akane<br/>sat.<p>As it was, he was very conscious of Akane sitting next to him. His chi<br/>was reigned in tightly, but he was acutely aware of the centimeter<br/>separating his knee from Akane's. He could feel her warmth, radiating<br/>from her, seeping slightly into his right leg. Ironically, the warmth<br/>sent chills down his spine, alternating with warmth that so<br/>confusingly came from his own heart. Akane, who now had her own bowl<br/>of rice cupped in her left hand, leaned to her left to reach for the<br/>stewed beef. She was wearing a half-thigh skirt, and her bare knee<br/>touched Ranma's.<p>His chopsticks fell onto the table with a clatter.<p>All eyes turned to Ranma. His expression was that of a deer that<br/>realized it was in the path of a train, while his right hand twitched<br/>quite noticeably every two seconds or so.<p>"Ranma, dear. Are you alright?" Saotome Nodoka had earlier noticed how<br/>close Akane and her son sat, and her heart had warmed at the sight of<br/>Akane taking surreptitious glances at Ranma. Her beloved son, much to<br/>her surprise, had acted _quite_ bashful.<p>(Better than being wishy-washy, I suppose,) she thought.<p>"Ranma? Are you okay?" Akane asked. Concern was quite visible on her<br/>face.<p>The pigtailed boy nodded his head vigorously. It was strangely<br/>reminiscent of how Soun shook his head when a panda had stepped into<br/>his house more than a year ago.<p>"You sure?" she continued, not satisfied with his reaction.<p>Again, tight-lipped, he nodded his head vigorously. Grabbing his<br/>chopsticks, he raised his bowl to his face and gave everyone at the<br/>table a front-row seat of his impromptu revision of the Saotome Secret<br/>Technique: Rice Bowl of Invisibility.<p>It was as effective as an ostrich burying its head in the ground.<p>Seeing that no answer was coming from Ranma, everyone turned to their<br/>own food and started eating.<p>"So, son. What technique have you learned?" Genma said after a few<br/>minutes of silence. He sat beside Nodoka, and was eating ONLY his<br/>food; the presence of his wife did wonders for the peace of the dinner<br/>table.<p>"Eh?" said the rice bowl.<p>"You spent a week in the dojo alone boy! And I heard you yell out<br/>earlier! You've learned a new technique! What is it?"<p>"Uh.. it's-" Ranma tried to find the exact words to best describe his<br/>new skills, when thoughts from a week ago came back to him.<p>(People are unwilling to share such knowledge or information because<br/>it would expose their weakness.)<p>His face twisted slightly into a thoughtful frown as his mind took<br/>over.<p>(Can't let them know about this! Once it gets out every old bat, freak<br/>and moron will stay out of my sight!) thought the young Saotome, who<br/>obviously had adopted endearing nicknames for some people.<p>(Shit! Here goes nothing... please Kami-sama let them believe this.)<p>"It's not a technique pop."<p>"What? Don't lie to your father boy!"<p>"I ain't lyin'! It's not a technique! I just have a new view on life!"<p>*Snap* went Genma's chopsticks.<p>(Please buy it please buy it please buy it please let pop buy it<br/>Nabiki too please please please)<p>"You... what?" said Genma, shock evident on his face.<p>"I spent the last week thinking of how to improve myself," said the<br/>pigtailed boy, brain working in overdrive to come up with a plausible<br/>twist to the truth.<p>"You... were... thinking?" Genma fumbled, obviously having trouble<br/>associating his son with such an act.<p>Mostly because the concept of thinking had of late become quite alien<br/>to him.<p>"Yeah! You got a problem with that?"<p>The elder Saotome took a deep breath, and with obvious restraint, said<br/>"And what exactly is your... new view on life?"<p>"I wanna learn as much as possible."<p>*Twitch* went Genma's left eyebrow. He was obviously on the verge<br/>of... something.<p>"Why Ranma, that's absolutely wonderful!" piped in Nodoka. At last,<br/>her son had realised the importance of education and wanted to improve<br/>his grades!<p>"I've brought you up to be the best martial artist ever, and you want<br/>to be a NERD?"<p>"Now, now, Genma dear. Our son wants to better himself. Not in the<br/>Art, true, but education is so very important nowdays. You should be<br/>proud of him," Nodoka patted her husband gently on his back.<p>"I will-"<p>"You will give him your full support, won't you _dear_?" Nodoka<br/>interjected smoothly, deftly insinuating her iron will into the last<br/>word. The last time Genma had his way, she had lost her son for ten<br/>years. Ten years to temper her will, and she would die before she<br/>failed her beloved son again.<p>"But... but..." Genma sputtered. He had planned on putting down his<br/>foot to overrule his misguided son and wife, as he had done more than<br/>ten years ago. Nodoka had all but decapitated his plan.<p>"Oh my, father. Is Uncle Saotome starting to cry?"<p>"Calm down dear. Here, have some more chicken. And some pickles.<br/>Kasumi, some more rice for my dear husband, if you please."<p>"Here you go, Uncle Saotome," said Kasumi, with her eternal angelic<br/>smile.<p>Genma nodded dumbly, burying himself (metaphorically, of course) in<br/>his dinner. A father could take only so much after all. Thank<br/>Kami-sama he had a wonderful wife who knew just how to comfort him in<br/>his hour of grief.<p>Not that he was too hard to understand, being as predictable as a<br/>jukebox.<p>(Oh Kami, thank you.) Ranma was being quite religious that evening.<br/>(Now for Nabiki... this is going to be harder than Pops.)<p>Ranma braced himself for the impending onslaught.<p>Only sounds of chewing and Genma's sniffling graced his ears.<p>(Any moment now...)<p>More chewing.<p>(Huh? She missed her cue?) he thought, looking up to Nabiki's place.<p>Which was occupied by a few cubic feet of air.<p>"Err... where's Nabiki?"<p>"Goodness, son. You were really lost in thought in the dojo, weren't<br/>you?"<p>"Err... I guess so. What does that have to do with Nabiki?"<p>"Only that she's gone for the a class trip to Yokohama for the<br/>weekend."<p>"She is?" said Ranma, with a puzzled look, which slowly turned into a<br/>goofy, relieved grin. (Oh thank you Kami-sama. Thank you thank you<br/>thank you! I'll never do anything bad ev- emm.. I'll never tell a lie<br/>ev- emm... I'll say some very nice things to the next priest I meet.<br/>Yeah! That's it! Thank you, Kami-sama!)<p>Elated and relieved at the good news, he resumed to eat at his normal<br/>pace, a rate that could shame industrial-strength vacuum pumps.<p>Finishing the last of his food, he patted his tummy, a huge grin on<br/>his face. "Ahh... that hit the spot. Great cooking Mom, Kasumi."<p>"Auntie cooked most of the food Ranma, I just helped a bit," Kasumi<br/>stated modestly. A slight blush adorned her cheeks; that Ranma could<br/>be _such_ a tease!<p>"Ranma, where are you going?" said the youngest Tendo as Ranma walked<br/>out of the dining room.<p>Akane's voice stopped Ranma in his tracks.<p>"I... uh... umm... going to... umm... wh- why do you ask?"<p>"Well, there's a movie on the tv in three hours... I was wondering if<br/>you'd like to- to watch it with me," she managed to say. Her voice<br/>was barely audible by the end of her sentence, as she was very<br/>conscious of the collective gazes her and Ranma's families gave her.<p>Genma started to say something, but somehow Nodoka's gentle hand on<br/>his shoulder cut off his words.<p>"I... uh... anoo... that is... I..." Ranma managed, quite eloquently.<br/>He had planned on practicing his new skills in the dojo right after<br/>dinner. A great battle (or act of great thievery, take your pick) was<br/>going to take place tomorrow, and he had to make sure that he was<br/>prepared. There was no time to waste, especially not with the tomboy!<p>All that was left was to convince himself that he really didn't want<br/>to take up Akane's invitation.<p>Soun decided to take the baton from his friend and speak for the boy.<br/>There was only one thing to say, after all. He opened his mouth, but<br/>shut it quite promptly when Nodoka gave him a curious-looking smile.<p>(Argghh! What's happening here?) Ranma screamed inwardly. It was<br/>supposed to be a simple affair; get up from the dinner table while<br/>ignoring all feelings for a certain somebody because that would make<br/>him think of things that was NOT prepared for, and go into the dojo<br/>and practice. Not to hide. Definitely not. Seriously.<p>(Gotta get outta here! Saotome Final Attack Revised! Insult Fiancee<br/>and Get Punted out of Town!)<p>"Ranma would love to join you, Akane," said Nodoka.<p>(Huh? Mom?)<p>Nodoka turned to her son and gave him a smile. "You have been hard at<br/>work all week, dear. You should get some rest, and I don't mean<br/>sleeping."<p>"Really?"<p>Nodoka's gentle smile calmed him somewhat. "Of course, Ranma. Sleeping<br/>might freshen your body, but your mind needs a different kind of<br/>rest."<p>"Uhh... if you say so Mom. Emm... in three hours right? I- I'll be in<br/>the dojo till then," he said, quickly stepping out of the room before<br/>anyone else could vocalize any more ideas.<p>Turning back towards the table to help Kasumi with the dishes, Nodoka<br/>found Akane smiling at her with a look of relief and gratitude.<p>"Thank you, auntie," she said quietly.<p>Nodoka merely returned her smile, and patted Akane's hand on the table<br/>gently.<p>"You're more than welcome, dear."<p>==========<p>"Saotome."<p>"Yes, Tendo?"<p>They were sitting across the shogi board again, Soun smoking a<br/>cigarrette.<p>"She's astounding."<p>"Who is, Tendo? Look Tendo! A shooting star!"<p>They were playing their version of shogi.<p>"Where? Eh? But we're indoors, Saotome... huh? Now that's odd," said<br/>Soun. He scratched his head, and continued, "Your wife, Nodoka. She<br/>was amazing, Saotome."<p>"That she is, Soun," Genma paused. "By the look in the boy's eyes, I<br/>thought that he would say something unkind to Akane." Placing a piece<br/>on the board, he said "We were lucky she was there, old friend."<p>"I agree. Her skills are formidable, Saotome."<p>"Very, Tendo."<p>"We should've roped her in from the start."<p>"Live and learn, Tendo. Live and learn."<p>==========<p>Akane looked at the clock on the living room wall.<p>(Where is that baka?)<p>A bowl of mixed nuts and two covered mugs of hot cocoa sat on the<br/>table, courtesy of Kasumi.<p>(It's five minutes till the show!)<p>She was dressed in her yellow pyjamas, two pillows by her side.<p>(He'd better not forget...)<p>The room was dark, save for the television, which was showing an<br/>advertisement for an isotonic drink.<p>She looked at the clock.<p>(Four minutes... )<p>Two more commercials, and she glanced at the wall clock again.<p>(That's it! I'm going to drag him in here by his pigtail if I have<br/>to!)<p>Just as she was about to get up, the shoji slid open, and Ranma<br/>stepped in.<p>Her back facing the sliding door, Akane put on her best expression of<br/>disapproval. He had always looked cute as he floundered trying to come<br/>up with explanations, and the sight of that was just what she needed<br/>to ease the irritation she felt earlier. It was a small matter,<br/>really, but one had to stick to principals, after all. "It's about<br/>time you got in here. The movie's about to start," she said, turning<br/>around.<p>Ranma did not so much as walk into the room as he did stagger. Looking<br/>extremely drained from his workout, he sat by the table opposite<br/>Akane. Wordlessly, he grabbed one of the mugs, and downed its contents<br/>in a few loud gulps.<p>"Ahhh..."<p>Putting the mug back on the low table, he sat facing the television,<br/>hands on his knees.<p>(What's wrong with him? He's not saying anything!)<p>She turned to look at the television, then back at Ranma.<p>Who was still in the same position.<p>"Ranma?"<p>No response came.<p>"Ranma?" she said, a bit louder.<p>Still no response. A sliver of worry formed in her chest; a sliver,<br/>but cold nonetheless.<p>"Ranma? What's wrong?" said Akane, tentatively reaching out for her<br/>fiance.<p>The only sound came from the television. She touched his shoulder.<p>"Zzzz..."<p>Akane promptly rediscovered the taste of tatami as she face faulted.<br/>Leave it to a male Saotome to fall asleep with his eyes open.<p>She got up with a sigh, and stared at her sleeping fiance.<p>"Baka." she said softly, shaking her head.<p>Grabbing one of the pillows, she slowly pushed Ranma onto his back,<br/>resting his head on the pillow. She straightened his legs and put his<br/>arms by his side.<p>She took her own pillow, and lay by his side, facing the television.<br/>Akane looked at her sleeping fiance.<p>(Baka) she thought, without any real malice or anger.<p>(So much for resting the mind.) she sighed.<p>(At least he didn't forget.)<p>With that, she turned her attention to the movie, a smile on her face.<p>==========<br/>-The Next Day-<p>It was a beautiful Saturday morning. The sun shone unhindered, the sky<br/>was fantastically blue, the clouds mere wisps, giving one the perfect<br/>opportunity to gaze into the sky and lose oneself in its vastness. The<br/>air was so fresh and crisp, that one could not help but feel alive,<br/>and the slight breeze carried with it the simple yet contagious<br/>excitement of a new day. Even those who usually did not welcome<br/>mornings felt that everything was right, and that they could take on<br/>the world that day.<p>(Man, I feel I can take on the world!) See?<p>(Heck! Make that the world AND the old ghoul!)<p>Yes, even the very embodiment of disorder - though not by choice -<br/>was not immune to the wonderful morning.<p>(Better watch out old ghoul, here I come!)<p>A smirk crept into his face without his realizing it. He was walking<br/>towards the Neko-hanten, with a secret mission: to steal Cologne's<br/>secrets, from right under her wrinkled, ancient, shrunken nose.<p>His purposeful stride, as well as the smirk was broken as a thought<br/>crossed his mind: what if Cologne caught him? She'd been around before<br/>Nerima got its name, and undoubtedly had a lot of tricks up her<br/>voluminous (though rather short) sleeves. There was no telling what<br/>she would do to him, what with the unyielding martial laws of her<br/>village and the tenacity with which she upheld said laws.<p>(Heh. Let her try.)<p>He continued forward, though his heartbeat had risen a bit. The risk<br/>of being caught fueled his anticipation and gave rise to his<br/>excitement. The familiar smirk crept into his face again; THIS was<br/>what he lived for! The Art. Unadulterated, dangerous, pure and deadly.<br/>For this he would sacrifice his life. For the Art he would walk into<br/>the lion's *shudder* den; there was no other way he would live his<br/>life.<p>Not to mention that he wouldn't have time to think about Akane.<p>(Damnit! Why do I hafta think about that tomboy now?)<p>Yes, Saotome Ranma was at a loss of what to do or think. Yesterday,<br/>during that brief glance in the early evening, he saw and felt<br/>something that he thought he'd never see from the short-haired girl.<p>He felt lo-<p>"But that can't be fucking right!" he exclaimed as he killed that line<br/>of thought, oblivious to the looks of passers-by. (She hates being<br/>engaged to me! She's said that so many times! There's no way she'd lo-<br/>lo- err.. like me if she hates the damn engagement!)<p>He came across a pebble and kicked it absent-mindedly. The poor piece<br/>of stone skittered down the cement road, for two hundred and eight<br/>meters before it finally lost momentum and came to a stop.<p>(And what the hell was that thing with the knee about?) he grumbled.<br/>The smoothness of Akane's skin had penetrated the fabric of his<br/>drawstring pants. An electric shock couldn't have made him drop his<br/>chopsticks any faster.<p>(Maybe I should start wearin' jeans,) he thought, and subconciously<br/>reached down to scratch his knee. He could still feel it tingling, and<br/>a mental picture of Akane smiling came to his mind.<p>Which he banished by smashing his forehead into a nearby concrete<br/>wall.<p>(Focus! Gotta focus! Soul of ice... soul of ice...)<p>Having taken a few deep breaths to achieve the desired state of mind,<br/>he slowly stepped away from the wall and resumed his walk.<p>"Ano... young man," said an elderly gentleman, standing next to the<br/>wall.<p>"Excuse me, son!" he called out again, louder this time. Ranma still<br/>showed no sign of hearing him.<p>"Someone has to pay for this!" said the elderly man. He looked at<br/>Ranma, then to his wall, which had gained a roughly circular<br/>depression. Spider-web cracks radiated from the depression, courtesy<br/>of the pigtailed boy's forehead.<p>"Ah, who am I kidding?" he sighed. Turning around to enter his house,<br/>he muttered "At least he only gave it a small crack. That boy with the<br/>fangs would've given me a new gate."<p>==========<p>(Well, this is it.)<p>Ranma was a few meters away from the corner that stood between him and<br/>the Neko-hanten. He could not imagine how much he'd be fidgeting at<br/>the moment if he had not immersed himself in the Soul of Ice.<p>He channeled the minimum amount of chi required into his cornea, skin<br/>and on his eardrums, as well as his cochlea. His traning session the<br/>night before had been extremely draining, but it had been worth it.<p>Thinking of the general direction of the Neko-hanten, he filtered out<br/>the irrelevant input from the surrounding areas. Immediately he heard<br/>Shampoo singing to herself as she went about her duties. Pumping more<br/>chi, Mousse could be heard wiping the tables with a slightly abrasive<br/>piece of cloth. Then came the sound of broth bubbling on a stove,<br/>and the tap-tapping sound of Cologne's pogoing on her cane as his<br/>hearing reached the kitchen.<p>"Great grandmother! Shampoo go make delivery now!" he heard the bubbly<br/>Amazon call out in her cute, sing-song voice.<p>(All right! Perfect!) he thought, jumping over the wall and hiding<br/>behind it.<p>Shampoo's passage rang like sweet bells to his ears. A major problem<br/>had taken care of itself. He jumped over the wall and proceeded<br/>towards the Neko-hanten.<p>(Hmm... the ghoul's in the kitchen. Hafta get past that idiot Mous-)<p>A smile slowly crept into his face.<p>(Mousse! Perfect! I've always wanted to know how he stuffs all those<br/>things up his sleeves!) Ranma was nearly rubbing his hands in glee.<br/>(Not to mention I get some real life practice before I move on to<br/>uglier fish!)<p>Cologne definitely had a point whenever she called him impertinent.<p>(Now... how to go about this...) he quizzed himself. A thought struck<br/>home; Nabiki would have been extremely jealous of the accompanying sly<br/>expression on his face had she seen it.<p>Ranma stepped into the restaurant.<p>"Welcome to Ne- Saotome! What the hell are you doing here?"<p>"I've come for Shampoo, bird brain."<p>The cloth he had been using to wipe the tables fell from limp hands.<br/>Mousse's jaw hang slack, his face twitching erratically.<p>Mousse had never heard Ranma utter those words. Now the unspoken had<br/>been made heard.<p>"You look really dumb Mousse, standing there with yer mouth open. No<br/>wonder she wants nothing to do with you."<p>Limp fingers curled, and knuckles under teenaged Chinese skin popped.<p>"Where is she anyway? I'm getting hungry..."<p>Smouldering eyes narrowed dangerously behind thick lenses.<p>"... and she's just right for eating."<p>"DIE!"<p>==========<p>Ranma grinned to himself. It couldn't have been more predictable if he<br/>had thrown a lit match onto gasoline.<p>As Mousse yelled out the battle cry, Ranma made a standing leap<br/>backwards, onto the wall in front of the restaurant. With another<br/>leap, he bounded off onto the rooftops, with Mousse in hot pursuit.<p>(Hmm... the ol' ghoul's cheking the dining area. Musta heard Mousse<br/>shout. Bet she didn't hear me egg him on though. Good. The last thing<br/>I need is her putting words in my mouth later.)<p>Ranma leapt off another roof, the power behind the leap good to clear<br/>exactly three roofs and onto the fourth.<p>"You're doing good speed today Mousse," he said quietly, more to<br/>himself.<p>Mousse was eight roofs behind him. His heartbeat was two hundred and<br/>forty-one per minute, and his left hand twitched slightly as he ran.<br/>The veins in Mousse's head were throbbing, and he was grinding his<br/>teeth very hard.<p>Ranma didn't need to look to find out. Looking was no longer<br/>necessary.<p>(Let's fan the fire a little bit before we start.)<p>The pigtailed boy turned around in mid-leap.<p>"Yo Mousse!"<p>The other boy only continued to charge forward with a snarl on his<br/>face.<p>"Really nice of ya to come and help me look for Shampoo like this!"<br/>shouted Ranma.<p>The young Saotome was rapidly approaching his next rooftop. He made no<br/>move to turn around, but extended his leg backwards. His foot found<br/>purchase on a tile, and his knee bent to absorb the impact. The leg<br/>straightened, and again Ranma was airborne for a four-roof leap.<p>Mousse was too immersed in rage to notice that Ranma was running<br/>backwards across rooftops.<p>"Finding her will be faster with both of us looking, right Mousse?"<p>That his face twitched into a fiercer snarl and his closing the gap by<br/>a roof was the only indication that Mousse had heard Ranma.<p>(Damn! I can feel him mad! Talk about a burning rage, he's hot enough<br/>to cook something!) Running backwards, Ranma was getting a full view<br/>of Mousse's anger. Deep hatred radiated from Mousse, accompanied with<br/>a constant strobe of dark, harmful intentions. Visible even to the<br/>naked eye, Mousse's rage shot flaming daggers to Ranma's hyper senses.<p>(Need a good place to fight him. Hmm... let's see...)<p>Ranma channeled more chi into his senses. A dull reaction with a tinge<br/>of solidity to the west brought a smile to his face. He corrected his<br/>course with another backward leap.<p>"And when we find her you can go back home feather breath, 'cuz I'm<br/>gonna have some SERIOUS fun with Shampoo!"<p>"ARRRGGHHH! I'll kill you! I'll kill you Saotome!"<p>The young Saotome flipped in mid-air and landed at the edge of a<br/>construction site, deserted at the moment, as he knew it would be.<p>"Sure, but wait after I get a few mouthfuls of her, will ya?"<p>"DIE!"<p>Ranma put on his best smirk, and said, "I don't think so."<p>Mousse descended upon Ranma, arms raised above his head.<p>"DIEEEE!"<p>Mousse lashed his hands forward, and forty three weighted chains shot<br/>out of his robes.<p>His opponent didn't move. Ranma was too startled to move.<p>(I saw it!)<p>Ranma stood there, gaping. One would think that he was paralysed in<br/>fear, but Ranma was in fact astounded by the sight and feel of energy,<br/>not to mention that odd rippling sensation he felt when the chains<br/>shot out.<p>The chains were about to ensnare Ranma when the traces of Mousse's chi<br/>on the weights pricked sharply at his senses, breaking his trance.<br/>Instinctively he cartwheeled to the side, just in time as the chains<br/>passed through where he had been a split second ago.<p>(Shit!)<p>With that, he took a giant leap and headed for the rooftops again.<p>Mousse snarled in anger. His prey was running away during battle!<br/>"Coward! Come back here you womanising bastard!"<p>Ranma merely shook his rear at Mousse in mid-leap.<p>"Arrgghh!"<p>An enraged Mousse leapt after Ranma for another bout of aerial<br/>pursuit.<p>==========<p>Ranma's face held a frown. He was in deep thought, trying to decipher<br/>what it was he had witnessed during that brief moment the chains had<br/>shot out of Mousse's sleeves.<p>(That burst of chi from him... it was intense! Intense? Fuck! It was<br/>like a hundred people in a drop of water! It's not possible!)<p>No wonder the young Saotome bolted. Startling discoveries were best<br/>contemplated in motion. Especially if the source of the revelation was<br/>trying to inflict massive bodily harm, and even death onto the<br/>discoverer.<p>(He shouldn't have that much chi! If he did he could crumple Ryouga<br/>like a soda can! And I kick his ass all the time! Is he playing with<br/>me or what?)<p>Ranma was running across rooftops on autopilot, his hyper senses<br/>guiding him towards areas that were obstacle-free. He was making<br/>five-roof leaps, trying to buy more time as he thought.<p>(With that much chi he should be dribblin' the ol' ghoul like a soccer<br/>ball! Not wiping tables! He could tear that moron Taro apart in any<br/>form!)<p>He looked over his shoulder, more out of habit. Mousse was still there<br/>in hot pursuit.<p>(Why would anyone that strong endure all the humiliation of being<br/>beaten by me? It's an honour to have yer ass kicked by the best<br/>martial artist around, not to mention the best looking, but...)<p>He landed atop a stone wall and ran along the top, and leapt off at a<br/>corner.<p>(He has the strength, but it's like he doesn't. It's li- Wait a<br/>minute! Does he convert all his chi to store all those weapons? But<br/>that's stupid! Trading off that much chi for a skill that gets you yer<br/>ass handed over on a platter each damn time is too fucking stupid!)<p>A crow squaked as Ranma shot across its flight path. The boy had moved<br/>too fast for it to notice sooner; the poor bird died instantly from<br/>shock and fell to the ground.<p>(Maybe he only knows how to use the chi to store the weapons. But<br/>that's lame! If you play with that much stuff you're bound to learn<br/>something new! Even those stupid toy robots those kids play with at<br/>the playground could be taught to do stuff! And they run on batteries<br/>for Kami-sama's sake!)<p>Ranma's eyes suddenly shot to the size of saucers, a look of shock on<br/>his face. The expression was slowly replaced with a smile and a glint<br/>of glee in his eyes. 'I have a plan' might as well had been painted<br/>across his forehead in neon colours.<p>(Now where should I...)<p>He pumped some chi into his senses, and again received a dull<br/>reaction, this time a kilometer due north. On the next leap he<br/>corrected his course.<p>He turned around in mid leap to face the chinese boy. "Mousse! I see<br/>her man! You can go home now! Me and her are gonna have a meal!<br/>Actually, I'm going to be the one eating!"<p>Not surprisingly, Mousse didn't turn around and go home.<p>==========<p>Ranma stood in front of an abandoned warehouse, hands in his pockets,<br/>wearing his patented Oh-I-Am-Gonna-Kick-Yer-Ass-Like-Yer-A-Tellytubby<br/>smirk.<p>Naturally Mousse blew his top when he saw the smirk. Who wouldn't?<p>Then Ranma turned his back to Mousse, looked at the sky and started<br/>whistling.<p>"Arrgghh! Die you bastard!"<p>Eighteen shuriken, four spears, seventeen chains, five plumed darts<br/>and three yo-yos shot out of Mousse's sleeves in random order. Ranma<br/>dodged, ducked, bobbed and wove out of their way, all the while with<br/>his back towards Mousse.<p>You didn't need to look when you had super senses, after all.<p>The Chinese boy threw more and more weapons, including a few shower<br/>nozzles and roll of toilet paper. Ranma found it surprisingly easy<br/>pinpointing the location and type of each weapon. He had covered his<br/>exposed skin with an ultra-fine layer of chi. Considering the fact<br/>that he could differentiate colour by chi reaction alone, Ranma could<br/>practically 'see' the weapons as they reflected sunlight towards him.<p>(I've got eyes on the back of my head! Wait till the ghoul sees this!)<p>The dance continued. Still facing away from Mousse, Ranma was grinning<br/>like an idiot. With the release of each weapon he learned more and<br/>more.<p>Just before a weapon was released, Mousse's level of chi would spike<br/>tremendously, although extremely muted and not readily recognizeable<br/>as chi. Ranma however, had flared his battle aura, although thinly and<br/>not readily visible. Mousse was well within his aura field, and each<br/>chi spike from Mousse pushed foreign ki, including Ranma's, away a<br/>millimeter or two.<p>(Too easy!) He smirked.<p>The muted chi also excited air molecules around Mousse in a very<br/>distinctive manner. The air around Mousse would change density very<br/>minutely, but it was enough to affect the speed and path of the<br/>surrounding light. Ranma - with his back to Mousse - saw it like it<br/>was the shimmering of air above burning desert sands; he seriously<br/>doubted that anyone else, including Cologne, could see it.<p>Saotome Ranma was getting a multi-dimensional view of Mousse's prized<br/>technique.<p>The chi would then rapidly drop; the weapon had been released from<br/>storage. The exit however, would cause a rippling effect in Mousse's<br/>natural unmuted chi, particularly around his arms.<p>"Just below the elbows," Ranma muttered softly to himself. "Must be<br/>the exit points."<p>Ranma suddenly backpedalled rapidly towards Mousse, avoiding all<br/>incoming projectiles as he did. Startled, Mousse quickly regained his<br/>composure and changed his stance, dropping his arms to his sides.<br/>Ranma sensed the spike of muted chi, and felt two medium sized objects<br/>materialize.<p>(Chinese broadsword, shortened spear.)<p>Indeed they were. Mousse caught the falling weapons by hilt and shaft;<br/>the spear stabbed upwards and missed as Ranma weaved behind the<br/>upraised arm. The Chinese boy jumped and twisted, slashing visciously.<br/>Unfortunately for him, Ranma had also jumped in the same direction,<br/>staying close and under attack range. Ranma lashed out and hit the<br/>base of his opponent's flexors; the sword dropped from numb fingers.<br/>He grabbed the limp wrist, and twisted the arm until it was pressed<br/>against Mousse's back. Now facing Mousse's back, Ranma could see his<br/>opponent bite back a shout of pain, drop the spear he was still<br/>holding, and rapidly cock his free arm, as if to elbow Ranma.<p>(Let me have it duck boy!)<p>Again the muted chi spike came, but this time Ranma was in physical<br/>contact with Mousse, and felt something he had not detected earlier.<br/>Ranma made a quick front kick, hitting Mousse just above a kidney,<br/>sending the Chinese boy sprawling into the dirt five meters away just<br/>as a wicked spear ripped through the sleeve, grazing empty air.<p>Mousse quickly got to his feet and whirled around to face his<br/>opponent. A condescending smirk greeted him. He could only snarl in<br/>rage, and stood there assessing his foe, trying to strategise.<p>(Mousse, Mousse, Mousse. I thought you were a real martial artist, but<br/>you're just as bad as that Copycat Ken faker.)<p>Ranma had discovered another facet of Mousse's Hidden Weapons<br/>Technique. Eight very thin strips of wood, four on each side, running<br/>down the spine, just under the skin. Two strips more on each tricep<br/>just before the elbow. Each strip was heavily saturated with ki, but<br/>the ki - which definitely wasn't Mousse's - was dormant; the ones on<br/>his back kept the weapons away in folded space. The ones near the<br/>elbows acted as entry/exit points. Ranma suspected there were similar<br/>strips in Mousse's feet or legs.<p>To release a weapon, Mousse would charge a combination of the strips<br/>with his own chi. The strips would react, and unfold the space storing<br/>the desired weapon. Also reacting to the chi, the exit points would<br/>synchronize with the unfolding space and disgorge the weapon.<p>(Still, very impressive, Mousse. That's one hell of a way to use chi.<br/>Hmm...)<p>Ranma however, still could not see how the chi was manipulated to<br/>achieve such a feat. Another experiment was due. He grinned.<p>Mousse suddenly felt a shiver run down his spine. That grin. That<br/>accursed grin made him shiver. It was a bad omen if there ever was<br/>one.<p>Unfortunately, his rage overshadowed his fear. Saotome was going to<br/>die. He lunged forward for a quick kill.<p>Ranma was in a ready stance, waiting for just the right moment. Just<br/>as he sensed that Mousse was going to charge the strips, he shot out<br/>with all his speed and disappeared from view.<p>To appear behind Mousse, and slammed the boy with an open palm strike<br/>right above a strip as it unfolded a weapon. Ranma sent a single<br/>Amaguriken-speed jab to the strips at an elbow just before it<br/>disgorged the weapon.<p>The weapon finally materialized: it was a jagged broadsword. Grabbing<br/>it by the hilt, Mousse swung around, hoping to cleave and rent Ranma's<br/>flesh.<p>Only to see a ball of ki right before his face.<p>The last things Mousse remembered was a painful impact on his body,<br/>flying backwards through the air, and then, blackness.<p>==========<p>Ranma stood erect, tall and proud, a few meters away from the<br/>unconscious Mousse. He was smiling in triumph. Not over defeating<br/>Mousse; that was a given.<p>He had finally completely uncovered the secret to Mousse's Hidden<br/>Weapons Technique.<p>Whomever had designed the wooden strips embedded under Mousse's skin<br/>had Ranma's respect. To have designed such wonders was no mean feat.<br/>The wooden strips were self-recharging batteries, constantly drawing<br/>in ki from the surroundings. They functioned discreetly, and not only<br/>stored the ki, but also forced it to fold and weave in intricate and<br/>complex patterns. The patterns of the ki practically resonated with a<br/>volume of space, and slight alterations to the patterns - by means of<br/>the user's chi - literally bent said volume of space to the whims of<br/>the controller. Being simple devices, the strips in Mousse contained<br/>only two functions: bend space to store objects, and serve as entry<br/>points. Applying a certain amount of chi in the correct manner would<br/>result in temporary and selective halt in pattern effect; respective<br/>volumes of spaces would stop folding, and the object stored will be<br/>disgorged through the chosen exit point.<p>Simply ingenious.<p>(You're not as pathetic as I thought, Mousse. That takes a lot of<br/>skill.)<p>Ranma now knew the concept. He knew what to do, and what the effect<br/>would be. Even the pattern that resonated with volumes of space was<br/>known to him. But he still had two problems.<p>The first problem: he just didn't have the batteries.<p>(Geez. Like I'm some kinda rabbit, needin' batteries and all,) he<br/>thought, a picture of a pink fluffy rabbit continuously beating a drum<br/>forming in his head. He looked at Mousse. (Hah! Some rabbit, feathered<br/>too!)<p>The second problem was much harder than it sounded. How to actually<br/>fold chi into the patterns he wanted. He'd never done that before. The<br/>Mouko Takabisha used confidence as a proxy to create chi patterns. The<br/>same goes for the Soul of Ice, using calm of mind as a proxy to<br/>generate cold chi. Manipulating chi directly was just something he'd<br/>never done before, and the patterns for the Mouka Takabisha and Soul<br/>of Ice were nowhere near the space-folding pattern. He had no idea on<br/>how to start. He couldn't pull the details out of the strips within<br/>Mousse; they held only the final pattern, which he knew. What he<br/>needed was HOW to start and arrive at the final pattern.<p>Ranma sighed. (This ain't over just yet.) He looked at Mousse. (Duck<br/>boy's gonna have questions when he wakes up. Might as well use the<br/>time to think of something to say to him.)<p>With that, he sat on the ground, leaning on the wall opposite Mousse,<br/>and thought.<p>==========<p>Mousse awoke to acute pain. His head throbbed, and his chest, chin and<br/>cheeks felt battered. Which they were. He groaned, and tried to<br/>massage his temples, but found he couldn't. Something heavy was<br/>holding both his arms down. He opened his eyes and looked downwards,<br/>and found himself bound in chains.<p>"Heyya Mousse. I thought you'd never wake up."<p>"Saotome! Let me go so I can kill you!"<p>"Aww c'mon Mousse. Chill out man, you'll burst an artery if you don't"<p>"The only blood that will be spilled today will be yours, you<br/>womaniser! Now let me go!"<p>"Why are you so pissed off Mousse?"<p>The Chinese boy would've facefaulted if he could. "For even thinking<br/>of dishonoring Shampoo, I will give you untold pain! Let me go and let<br/>me kill you!"<p>"You're still mad about that?"<p>Mousse's eyes bugged out behind his thick lenses. "What the hell do<br/>you think you coward? Let -"<p>"you go so you can kill me and uphold Shampoo's honour. Geez, Mousse,<br/>I'm not like that Eyen-stain guy, scientific genius and all, but I'm<br/>not that dumb either. If you want me to let you go you're gonna calm<br/>down first."<p>"Calm down? Calm down? You want to desecrate Shampoo and you want me<br/>to calm down?"<p>"Fer cryin' out loud, if I wanted to do that do you think I'd be here<br/>talking to you? Shampoo would be all over me before I finished asking<br/>he-"<p>"Arrrgghh! You sick bastard! Let me go! I'll kill you! I'll kill you<br/>dead! Let me go now!"<p>(Whoops. Wrong thing to say. Heh.)<p>The pigtailed boy did something he never did before: took a moment to<br/>choose his words. "Look Mousse, I didn't really mean it when I said<br/>that I wanted to have a go at Shampoo. I was just kiddin' man."<p>"You're lying! Nobody can resist the beauty and grace of Shampoo!"<p>"Oh fer Kami's sake..."<p>"I see it now, Saotome! You lured me out here so that you can dispose<br/>of me! Then you plan to- to- NO! Shampooo! Noo! ..."<p>Ranma slapped his forehead and sighed as Mousse continued to rant the<br/>products of his imagination. Looking up to the sky, Ranma thanked the<br/>powers that be that Mousse's imagination wasn't as warped as Kuno's.<p>He closed the gap between them and bapped his fist on Mousse's head.<p>"Shut up you moron! If I wanted to off you do you think you'd really<br/>be here talking to me right now?"<p>"Ha! You just want to kill me slowly so you can recount your dirty<br/>deeds to Shampoo!"<p>"What? How the hell did you come up with that you overgrown feather<br/>duster?"<p>"Don't play dumb Saotome. You don't fool me! I know you-"<p>"IF you know ME you'd know that if I WANTED you dead you'd be ALL over<br/>Tokyo by now or have you forgotten Saffron you moron?"<p>Silence. Mousse had indeed remembered Saffron. Much too clearly for<br/>his liking.<p>A few minutes passed in silence, each boy with their own thoughts,<br/>collecting their respective breaths.<p>Mousse turned to face Ranma. "Then why all this?"<p>"Huh? This? Oh, this. Ermm.. I was bored really."<p>Mousse could only gape. A few long moments passed. "What?"<p>"C'mon man! Look around you! It's a beautiful day! You really want to<br/>spend it indoors doing what other people tell you to do?"<p>The Chinese boy paused a moment, and glanced upwards towards the sky.<br/>His coke-bottle glasses were somehow still affixed to his face.<p>"Don't tell me that you can't feel it's a good day today, Mousse. You<br/>might be nearly blind as a bat," Mousse grimaced at the Saotome's lack<br/>of subtlety "But I know you can feel it man."<p>Mousse took a deep breath. There weren't any apparent alternative<br/>reasons to Ranma's actions. None that he could see, anyway. "I guess I<br/>can, Saotome."<p>Ranma grinned.<p>Mousse continued, "So you decided to drag me from my duties and beat<br/>me up huh?"<p>"Err... now that you put it that way... what? Don't give me that look!<br/>It's not like you couldn't take what I dished out to ya or anything!<br/>You're a martial artist, remember? Anyway, what else was I supposed to<br/>do? Go hang out with the girls? Yeah, right! I'd spend my time kicking<br/>Ryouga's ass, but he was here a few days ago... he won't be back for<br/>at least three more weeks. I'd hang out with Hiro and Dai, but your<br/>place was closer."<p>"Oh, how pleased I am to know that I was your first choice for<br/>companionship, Saotome."<p>The young Saotome had the decency to look apologetic. He scratched the<br/>base of his pigtail, "Err.. heh heh."<p>"Frankly Saotome, I'm surprised that a womaniser like you isn't up and<br/>about sinking your dirty claws into Shampoo when you have the time and<br/>chance to do it."<p>Ranma gave Mousse a dirty look. "Me? Spend time with Shampoo?<br/>Willingly?"<p>"And what the hell is wrong with my beautiful Shampoo you bastard?"<p>"Hello? Anyone home? Can ya say 'Bombed Wedding'? Can you?" Ranma was<br/>looking right into the other boy's eyes, a frown creased into his<br/>brow.<p>"Oh." He looked down, and back up at Ranma. "Does that mean you wanted<br/>to get married back then?"<p>"Huh?" Ranma started to pale. That was a question he did not expect,<br/>and in all honesty, had no intention of touching with a five mile<br/>pole. "I... uh... I... that is... umm... what I mean to say... tsk..."<p>"I'm listening, Saotome."<p>Ranma threw his arms up in exasperation. "Argh! What I wanted has<br/>nothing to do with it! It's the principle of the thing! It's my life<br/>Mousse! How do you think I feel when the people I trust... err.. sorta<br/>trust... come barging in and demand that I do as they want? How do you<br/>feel when the ol' ghoul knocks you out so you can't go after Shampoo<br/>when you want to? Huh? How do you feel about THAT, Mousse?"<p>Mousse started to say something, but halted, and closed his mouth. He<br/>shifted and leaned against the warehouse wall. Ranma reached out and<br/>undid the chains. The other boy slowly stood up, groaning as his<br/>injuries made themselves felt. He shook the chains off his person, and<br/>sat back down, leaning against the wall besides Ranma. Neither spoke.<p>"So I take it that you're not interested in Shampoo for the moment,<br/>Saotome?"<p>Ranma gave a snort. "Finally," he sighed. "I never have, Mousse. I<br/>wanted a friend, ya know. Not someone who latches onto me the moment<br/>she sees me."<p>"Then why didn't you tell her that?"<p>"Huh? You deaf as well as blind Mousse? How many times have I told her<br/>NOT to glomp me? That I ain't interested in her that way? How many<br/>times? I've lost count, man."<p>Mousse turned to briefly look at Ranma. "So you say, Ranma. But you<br/>love the attention. Don't say that's not so, Saotome."<p>"Huh? Whaddaya mean? I ain't like that!"<p>"Really? Remember the reversal jewel?"<p>"Reversal j-... Oh." Nabiki had filled him in on that little escapade.<br/>For a price, of course.<p>A few minutes passed in silence.<p>"You know, the old mummy is going to kick my butt when I get back."<p>"Umm... sorry, man."<p>"Nahh. You're right. It's a beautiful day. It'd be a nice walk back, I<br/>think."<p>"Yeah. Say, if it helps any, just tell the ol' ghoul I clipped you<br/>clean with a Mouko Takabisha, and you were out of it a couple hours<br/>and couldn't find your way back."<p>The Chinese boy looked at Ranma. "You been taking lessons from Nabiki,<br/>Saotome?" he said, smirking.<p>"Actually Mousse, it _has_ been two hours. And we're about eight miles<br/>from Nerima."<p>The other boy gaped. "Eight miles?"<p>"I think so, anyway. Don't look so surprised Mousse. You did good<br/>speed today."<p>Mousse snorted. "Sure didn't feel like eight miles when I was<br/>running."<p>"Yeah, well..."<p>"Yeah," said the Chinese boy. He got up and dusted his clothes. "I'd<br/>better get moving."<p>Ranma also stood up. "Right. See ya Mousse."<p>"Hope not, Saotome."<p>"Whatever, Mousse."<p>With that, they walked off in opposite directions.<p>==========<p>Ranma stopped, and turned around, just in time to see Mousse round a<br/>corner and disappear from sight.<p>"I like the attention that much?"<p>He paused, frowning for a few seconds, then started to walk again,<br/>this time in deep thought.<p>==========<p>"Damn Casanova," muttered Mousse.<p>"He got me out of the Neko-hanten though. Haven't had time for myself<br/>for quite awhile."<p>He continued walking, and encountered more and more people as he came<br/>into a busier part of the town. The morning still held its vibrance,<br/>and the simple act of walking among throngs of other people made<br/>Mousse feel so... alive.<p>"Heh. The bastard may not be so bad after all."<p>==========<p>Kasumi put down the phone and returned to the living room, where<br/>Nodoka sat at the table, reading a magazine, and Akane watched an<br/>anime show.<p>"That was Ranma. He won't be back for lunch, but he'll be back for<br/>dinner."<p>"What?" Akane nearly shouted. She was scowling. "That- that- baka!<br/>He's off with his- his harem again! Ooohh! Wait till I get my hands on<br/>him!" She balled her fists, knuckles popping audibly.<p>Nodoka passed a discreet look at Kasumi, her eyes glinting with...<br/>mischief? "Oh dear. Are you sure about that, Akane-chan?"<p>"I'm positive aunty! He's either with th- that Chinese _floozy_, g-<br/>gobbling her ramen, or with that- crossdresser at Ucchan's!"<p>"Which cross-"<p>"The _female_ crossdresser!"<p>"Ah."<p>"Oh my. Ranma-kun is very naughty, ne?"<p>"That doesn't even begin to describe him, oneechan, and you know it!"<p>"Dear me. My son is so naughty. Where have I gone wrong?"<p>"Don't blame yourself aunty. That baka just wants to be that way!"<p>Nodoka let out a melodramatic sigh. "And so my errant son goes to<br/>flirt with other girls."<p>"Not just any girls! F- floozies and crossdressers!"<p>"Tsk. Remind me to have a few words with Ranma-kun later aunty. It's<br/>not proper for him to flirt with other girls."<p>"You said it, oneechan!"<p>"He should be here, spending time with you, just like you want, right,<br/>Akane-chan?"<p>"You're right aunty. He should be- be-..."<p>Akane found that she could not find any word to say. Her face was beet<br/>red, her mind reeling. Had she just said what she thought she did?<p>Kasumi turned to Nodoka, who was smiling. She smiled in return; her<br/>imouto-chan was just too adorable sometimes. Still...<p>She saw the smile on Nodoka's face lessen in favour of a concerned<br/>look as the older woman looked at Akane.<p>(Aunty Saotome feels it too.)<p>Kasumi shifted on her seat a little, and caught Nodoka's attention.<br/>The Saotome matriarch saw the look in the young girl's eyes, and<br/>nodded in understanding.<p>She turned to Akane, who was studiously watching the tv, which was<br/>rolling credits for the anime show. "Akane dear. I'm sorry to have<br/>teased you like that."<p>The youngest Tendo simply nodded, not taking her eyes off the tv.<p>"I- we want you to know Akane, that you can come to either Kasumi or<br/>I, or both of us, if you want to talk about anything."<p>Again, the nod.<p>"Remember Akane. We're here for you. Talk to us. I know just how<br/>infuriating and dense male Saotomes can be. It would hurt to just keep<br/>it inside."<p>Akane simply nodded again, now looking at her hands as she grabbed the<br/>hems of her skirt.<p>"Please excuse us, Akane-chan. Kasumi and I would like to start on<br/>lunch," said Nodoka, as she stood up and left for the kitchen. Kasumi<br/>followed suit.<p>"Oh, by the way, Akane-chan," Kasumi paused at the doorway. "Ranma<br/>isn't with Shampoo or Ukyou. He had a run-in with Mousse and somehow<br/>ended up in the next town. It's quite a trip, and it will take him<br/>some time to get home. Just so you know, imouto-chan," she said, and<br/>left.<p>Akane found herself easing her grip on the hem of her skirt, and her<br/>posture straightening from her slight slouch, and smiling a small<br/>smile.<p>(I'm an idiot.)<p>Her deep blush remained though.<p>==========<p>Ranma walked aimlessly, questions hammering away in his mind.<p>(Who made the strips? How did they make those strips? What kinda wood<br/>did they use?)<p>(Why make strips that act like movable wardrobes? Why not make strips<br/>that can fire really powerful blasts?)<p>(Why not just use the strips as pure batteries, and really enhance<br/>your own speed and strength? Even a short spurt of speed and strength<br/>could make all the difference in a battle.)<p>(How did they even find that pattern? It's amazing! How do _I_ make<br/>that pattern?)<p>(What effects will other patterns have? Will it be easier once I know<br/>how to start a pattern?)<p>(How the HELL do I start to make that pattern?)<p>He sighed, and glanced around him. He was standing outside a small<br/>outdoor cafe.<p>(Eh? Why the heck are those girls lookin' at me?)<p>It was quite a sight, to see a boy with a chiselled physique get<br/>suddenly nervous as he stood stock still, trying to look nonchalant,<br/>and failing miserably.<p>(Uhh... some of 'em are older than Kasumi...)<p>He looked away from the young women sitting at a table, trying to be<br/>casual about it. Didn't work. It only made him look cuter. The<br/>attention grew, and he didn't need his hyper senses to feel the<br/>collective gazes on the back of his head.<p>On his back. On his arms. On his-<p>(Soul of Ice! Ice cool! Uhmm... be casual. Yeah, that's it!)<p>He scratched the base of his pigtail.<p>It didn't work.<p>(Uhh... walk away, casually.)<p>He took a step, another step, another, and kept on. It didn't feel<br/>natural to him though. To his audience, it seemed that he was giving<br/>them a show, just for them.<p>They absolutely loved every second of it.<p>A brunette made the mistake of saying out too loud, "If he were a few<br/>years older, there isn't anything on earth that could stop me from<br/>grabbing that butt and ..."<p>Ranma didn't bother to hang around and hear anymore.<p>"Awww. Now look what you did, Ayami. You scared him away!"<p>Said girl could only pout, as did the others.<p>==========<p>Ranma finally slowed down his rapid walk.<p>"Man, what the hell is wrong with chicks nowdays?" he muttered. "If<br/>they ain't violent, they have weird looks in their eyes. And if that<br/>ain't the case, they're some money grabbing ... whatever."<p>He sighed.<p>"Why can't more girls be like Kasumi?"<p>No answer came, and he was glad that none did. It would really screw<br/>up his weird-o-meter if he somehow had gotten an answer out ot<br/>nowhere. He had had enough of that; Jusendo was still fresh in his<br/>mind.<p>(Jusendo.) he thought, and his face grew sullen.<p>(Damn! This ain't no way to spend my time!)<p>He took a deep breath, then another, and his face visibly relaxed.<br/>(Might as well start workin' on that chi pattern.)<p>Thus Ranma continued walking, oblivious to his surroundings.<p>==========<p>Chaos.<p>A popular misconception was that Chaos equalled destruction. That<br/>particular equation was just that: a misconception. A supernova might<br/>seem very chaotic, as might a collision of galaxies. However, neither<br/>of these highly destructive phenomena could be attributed to Chaos.<br/>Not directly, anyway.<p>Chaos affected sentient beings, mostly; if there were no such beings<br/>around to be directly affected, then the seeds of Chaos would be<br/>planted in a substance that most suited the seeds at that moment:<br/>whether in matter, or in anti-matter, or in the very fabric of space,<br/>or in that of time, or in the very core of existence itself. Thus<br/>sown, Chaos would germinate, its fruits being the stuff of dreams. Or<br/>nightmares.<p>Another facet of Chaos was its ignorance towards the concepts of<br/>justice. Good and evil were not recognized; Chaos merely affected.<br/>Beings with sufficient intelligence called it Uncertainty, or<br/>Unpredictability, while some called it the Future. Others confused it<br/>with Fate, which was merely an end, with Chaos being the occasional<br/>means to that end.<p>It was Kami-sama's way of ensuring that life - in any form, all<br/>throughout the universe - had a free hand. Through Chaos, no one<br/>being, no matter how powerful, had a monopoly over Existance; monopoly<br/>over Existance was the prerogative of the Creator, after all, and only<br/>the Creator. All of His creations bow to Chaos, whether they be gods,<br/>goddesses, angels, devils, demons, or humans. Even if His creations do<br/>not remember Him as being the Ultimate Power, they would always<br/>remember and know of Uncertainty, hanging somewhere, everywhere. Those<br/>who forget - or choose to forget - would be reminded in the worst<br/>possible manner.<p>Chaos could manifest itself as free-will, as non-conformance, as<br/>courage in the face of everwhelming odds, as a single word from a<br/>stranger that altered one's life forever, as anything it wanted. It<br/>was the very epitome of versatility.<p>In its pure form however, Chaos was energy. Not just any energy, but<br/>an Energy. An Energy was mostly sentient, though not completely; it<br/>would be prejudiced if it were. Not even the gods knew Chaos for what<br/>it truly was. Even to them, Chaos just was.<p>Once in a while, Chaos would choose an avatar. The candidate would be<br/>chosen at random, not limited to its point of coming into existence.<br/>Being an avatar could last either for an instant, or a lifetime. There<br/>would be no ceremonies, no announcements; what would one expect an<br/>Energy to say? In fact, the avatars of Chaos themselves were not aware<br/>of being such. They always suspected something though, when their<br/>surroundings or they themselves fell prey to excessive peculiar<br/>circumstances. For example, an avatar might cause unreasonable<br/>revulsion and hatred just by being somewhere, doing nothing. An avatar<br/>of Chaos might bring the light of hope into those whom had given up<br/>unconditionally, or turn the tide of a losing battle, or rain untold<br/>destruction upon the guilty and innocent alike, without any warnings.<p>An avatar of Chaos might have an idiotic father, trained in the<br/>Neko-ken, had at least three fiancees, hordes more of admirers (of<br/>both genders), throngs of enemies and rivals (also of both genders),<br/>knew in person at least two shrivelled trolls, was affected by a<br/>curse, and had fought on levels some minor gods had not seen before,<br/>among other things.<p>Chaos had an avatar named Saotome Ranma. A very good avatar. Had it<br/>been able to, Chaos would have said that Saotome Ranma was its<br/>favourite.<p>Poor Ranma.<p>==========<p>The young Saotome sighed. Life just wasn't fair. He had just cracked<br/>one of the most mind-boggling martial arts techniques of all times -<br/>the principles behind the technique were definitely awesome, even if<br/>the technique itself wasn't much - only to discover that the problem<br/>wasn't as cracked open as he had thought.<p>He had tried to find a pattern as he walked. It had proven too<br/>difficult; there were too many distractions as he walked. Thus he<br/>pushed the thought process out of his conscious thoughts. There would<br/>be enough time later, he thought.<p>The thought process, pushed out of Ranma's conscious thoughts, ended<br/>up in his subconscious. The subconscious is an amazing feature of<br/>humans. It reflected who a person really is, it stored all of his or<br/>her instinctive responses, as well as a person's strongest<br/>characteristics.<p>Among Ranma's strongest characteristic was the inability to accept the<br/>loss of a challenge, formal or otherwise. Thus, his subconscious mind<br/>resumed the thought process, trying to find the elusive space-folding<br/>pattern.<p>Ranma walked, taking in the scenery, oblivious to the fact that a<br/>minute amount of his chi was being woven and folded.<p>His subconscious finally found a pattern that could sustain the<br/>initial weaves and folds without immediately unravelling the moment<br/>another weave or fold was introduced. Hence, his subconscious decision<br/>to experiment further with said initial pattern, hoping to arrive at<br/>the space-fold pattern.<p>The initial pattern however, did not resonate with a volume of space,<br/>or anything pertaining directly to volumes of space.<p>The pattern resonated with a single strand of pure Chaos.<p>Poor, poor Ranma.<p>==========<p>"Emm, emm! This takoyaki is good!"<p>The pigtailed boy popped another squid ball into his mouth. He was<br/>still walking aimlessly around, taking his sweet time. Ranma decided<br/>that he quite liked walking around the city, observing people and what<br/>people did.<p>"Shoulda done this ages ago."<p>He was walking down a slightly busy road that ran down a hill. The<br/>hill had once been the home of oaks, cedars, pines, not to mention<br/>various wild animals; now it was filled to the peak with houses,<br/>shops, and people.<p>It was quite by accident that he looked off the hill into the<br/>distance.<p>"Hey... isn't that..." he squinted his eyes. "Yes it is! Hmm.. might<br/>as well..."<p>He quickly made his way off the hill, and made for the place he had<br/>spotted. Very soon, he came to the gates of a temple.<p>Ranma paused momentarily. "Hey, I did say I'd say something nice to a<br/>priest." With that, crossed the threshold into the temple compound.<p>Immediately he saw her. A breathtakingly beautiful woman, of<br/>devastating physical proportions, sitting on a rock, wearing peculiar<br/>robes that seemed to defy gravity. Her skin was wonderfully dark<br/>toned, a beautiful background for her lovely platinum blonde hair,<br/>which reflected the sunlight so. It was as if she had a halo, which<br/>made even her bored expression seem... breathtaking.<p>The pigtailed boy was no stranger to beautiful females. Somehow<br/>though, this particular woman in front of him caught his attention, in<br/>a way he had never known. Her delicate features were relaxed, her age<br/>- or rather, maturity - shining through her poise.<p>He approached her wordlessly, and at some point, lost to both of them,<br/>she became aware of his presence, and turned her attention upon him.<p>The boy drew in a sharp, deep breath, as he took in the sight of her.<br/>She had lovely eyes, almond shaped, and they hinted at exuberance and<br/>mischief - though for the moment, both characteristic lay dormant. The<br/>blue diamond-shaped birthmarks at the corner each eyes only<br/>highlighted the green of her eyes, such that they shone like emeralds.<br/>Against his will, his eyes roamed downwards, taking in the sight of<br/>her exquisite mouth, her delightful neck, a beautiful, wonderfully<br/>heaving ample bosom, her perfectly shaped hips - hidden as they were<br/>under her robes, her lovely long legs, and even her perfect toes.<p>She also inhaled sharply, and her eyes widened. As her heartbeat<br/>increased and her breathing deepened, her eyes roamed slowly over him,<br/>as did his on her, and she took careful notice of his slightly mussed<br/>hair, his smooth skin, the beautiful blue eyes, visibily soft, relaxed<br/>lips, his chest, wrought steel under red silk, and his exposed arms<br/>felt solid and strong even across the distance separating them. His<br/>grace was not lost upon her, even if he only stood still, as she sat<br/>unmoving.<p>A spark had obviously ignited, somewhere.<p>Was it a matter of physical reaction? Possibly, but both had been<br/>jaded by mere beauty alone. Could it be chemistry then? Also possible,<br/>but unlikely, since one was infused with Chi, while the other bathed<br/>in Mana.<p>It was the strand of Chaos, pulsating from his subconscious, that<br/>snaked between them, and gently stroked the base of her existance,<br/>where Mana infused with her soul. The tendril of Energy writhed and<br/>danced, strumming the Mana just as it entered her soul, and a<br/>particular tug from the strand made her inhale even sharper, even<br/>deeper, even when all he did was sit and stare at her.<p>He was also not spared, as the tendril snaked in and out of his chi;<br/>it was, at the moment, anchored in his subconscious, but the effect of<br/>the encouter would be felt, and remembered, by both his conscious and<br/>subconscious awareness. The tendril gently lashed at his chi at the<br/>same moment it tugged on her mana. She inhaled, and he visibly<br/>shuddered. The sight of the other's reaction made their respective<br/>hearts skip a few beats, and while she had the fortune of already<br/>being seated, he did not. He fell to his knees, still entranced in the<br/>very sight of her.<p>"I-"<p>Neither was sure who spoke.<p>"I came here, looking for a priest. It- it seems that I have found a<br/>goddess."<p>No reply came, for to both of them, the words somehow - though<br/>strangely - suited both of them.<p>Both had found a deity.<p>"I-"<p>But it was not meant to be. Chaos had other designs.<p>The tendril of Chaos elongated, and pushed the two apart. Not just<br/>yet, it would have said, had it been able to. He barely remembered<br/>standing up, and walking away, nor did she remember when he left. Each<br/>only saw the image of the other, permanently etched into their minds.<p>==========<p>"Urd?"<p>Urd did not move, her eyes still fixed at the spot where the youth had<br/>been.<p>"Oneechan?" Belldandy, goddess of the Present, waved a hand in front<br/>of Urd's eyes. Her older sister didn't respond at all.<p>The youngest of the three sisters decided she had had enough. "Urd you<br/>old hag! Wake up!"<p>The goddess of the past broke out of her trance with a visible<br/>shudder. Her eyes gained focus as she took in her surroundings. "Huh?"<p>"Urd? Are you alright? You had us worried, oneesan."<p>Skuld 'hmmph'ed, crossed her arms and looked away. "I wasn't worried."<p>Urd didn't reply, but looked at Belldandy, and then at Skuld, mental<br/>gears nearly audible in her mental overdrive. She turned to Belldandy<br/>again, and opened her mouth to say something, when her eyes widened<br/>suddenly and she looked at where the pigtailed boy had stood earlier.<p>"Where is he?"<p>"Where is who, Urd?"<p>"The guy! The guy that was here! Where is he?"<p>"Oneechan, there was nobody here when we found you."<p>"What? Are you blind? He was just here! Belldandy you must have seen<br/>him!"<p>"Urd..."<p>Urd nearly shouted, but managed to keep her calm; it was Belldandy,<br/>after all. "He stood," Urd pointed to the spot "There! Right there!<br/>Just a few moments ago! Where is he?"<p>Belldandy could only look at Urd silently, not knowing how else to<br/>tell her beloved sister that she had been found alone, staring out<br/>into empty air.<p>"Don't tell me you've finally grown senile, _big_ sister," said Skuld,<br/>poorly disguising her smirk and sarcastic tone.<p>Her sister whipped around to face her, scowling deeply. Urd's voice<br/>dropped into a near-growl. "Now look here you- you- arghh! This is a<br/>waste of time! I'm going!"<p>The eldest of the three Norns turned around and ran for the gate.<p>"Urd! Wait!"<p>A single foot already across the gate, Urd turned to look over her<br/>shoulder at Belldandy. "What?" she snapped, and caught herself,<br/>belatedly realizing the tone she had used on her guileless sister.<p>"Don't be so rude to oneechan, you old hag! And Father wants you and<br/>me in his office!"<p>Urd's face fell. "Huh? But I have to find-"<p>"No buts! We were due five minutes ago!" Skuld was hopping mad.<br/>They were supposed to appear before Him together, and her sister was<br/>making her look tardy.<p>"But-" Urd managed, looking out the gate. She had to find him! He had<br/>been there, and she _had_ seen him! She had HEARD him! He had somehow<br/>disappeared, and she just had to find him! She needed to! She didn't<br/>know why, but she knew she had to.<p>Both the other sisters looked at Urd, noting the internal conflict<br/>dancing across Urd's features. Both were worried, but only one showed<br/>it.<p>"Urd!" shouted Skuld, partly in anger, partly to snap her sister out<br/>of whatever was bothering her.<p>The goddess in question hissed under her breath. She took a deep<br/>breath, then tore away from the gate and sprinted into the temple<br/>proper. The faster she faced her Father, the faster she could get back<br/>to Midgard.<p>(And then I'm going to find him if it's the last thing I do!)<p>Skuld looked at Belldandy, a puzzled look in her eyes, and then raced<br/>after her eldest sister.<p>==========<p>Saotome Ranma was in a very foul mood, and didn't particularly care<br/>who knew it. All of his delight over learning a new technique had been<br/>abandoned in favour of stewing quietly in anger as he walked.<p>"Damn it!"<p>Relatively quiet, anyway.<p>Very rarely in his life had he been angry. He had learned a long time<br/>ago that anger served little purpose, that it spoke of lack of<br/>control. At the moment however, he let himself have the dubious<br/>pleasure of indulging in anger.<p>He had spent three hours trying to find the temple again. Three long,<br/>frustrating hours. To find a temple amidst houses and shops. It should<br/>have been the easiest thing. Instead it had been futile.<p>Ranma looked up into the sky; it would be dark soon. He continued<br/>walking back to the Tendo dojo.<p>The boy was at a loss over what had happened at the temple. He sorely<br/>needed to know who the woman was. No female had ever made him feel<br/>that way. To make things worse, he wasn't exactly sure what "that way"<br/>really was. Was it physical attraction? Was it something deeper? Who<br/>was she?<p>All he had were questions, and no answers. The cluelessness grated on<br/>his nerves, very much so. There had never been as great a mystery has<br/>the one he contemplated at the moment.<p>He looked up, and saw that he was very near to the Tendo dojo. He<br/>sighed.<p>Ranma started to resume walking, when he caught himself. He was going<br/>home with a very sullen expression. People would be curious, questions<br/>would be asked. He was not in the mood to answer questions, and most<br/>definitely not in the mood to explain to people why he was so upset<br/>over not being able to find a _girl_. Most probably he would be<br/>accused of finding another fiancee. No need to guess what would follow<br/>_that_ little exclamation.<p>He realized that he had to let go of his anger; it was not a luxury he<br/>could indulge in beyond the moment. Thus, he took a deep breath, and<br/>reached for his Soul of Ice.<p>==========<p>Ranma stepped out of the changing room, having bathed and changed into<br/>fresh clothes. His run-about earlier had left him a little sore, and<br/>the soak in the furo had been heavenly. He languidly walked into the<br/>dining room, free from his ealier anger, not paying particular<br/>attention to anyone.<p>He sat beside Akane at the table as Kasumi scooped the rice for<br/>everyone.<p>(Mmm... that smells good! I wonder what mom and Kasumi cooked up<br/>today.)<p>Being a male Saotome, Ranma let his nose do the pinpointing to the<br/>dish that was giving off the wonderful aroma. It was found in a<br/>second: a bowl of curry.<p>(Curry?)<p>He took the serving ladle, and scooped some of the gravy onto his<br/>rice, and popped some of the rice into his mouth.<p>"MMMPH!"<p>Everyone turned to look at him.<p>"What's the matter, Ranma dear?" asked Nodoka.<p>"This curry is great!" exclaimed the pigtailed boy. He quickly ladled<br/>more of the curry into his bowl and ate with his usual gusto.<p>"You really think so, Ranma-kun?" asked Kasumi.<p>"Uh huh," came the muffled reply.<p>Nodoka paused from eating her own food. "Well then, it's official.<br/>Akane-chan's cooking has definitely improved."<p>Ranma froze. He had been in the motion of shoving shoving more rice<br/>into his mouth. Shifting the bowl slightly, he looked at his mother<br/>with raised eyebrows.<p>"Eh?"<p>Nodoka merely smiled. "You heard me Ranma. Akane-chan cooked that<br/>curry."<p>The boy shifted his eyes to look at Kasumi, eyebrows still raised.<p>Kasumi nodded happily.<p>The young Saotome finally lowered his bowl, and looked to his right<br/>where Akane sat. He was nearly blinded by the beaming look his fiancee<br/>gave him.<p>He tried to find something to say. "Umm..." he managed. Giving it up,<br/>he just gave her a smile.<p>Akane beamed even more and looked down, blushing.<p>(Gawd! Akane cooked something this good? Gawd!)<p>Ranma resumed his shovelling of rice and beef curry into his mouth,<br/>occasionally reaching for the stir-fried spinach.<p>"Errm... Ranma." came a voice from his right?<p>"Yeah, Akane?" he replied, not looking away from his rice.<p>"Aren't you going to try the squid?"<p>For the second time that evening Ranma froze.<p>"S- squid?" he squeaked behind the bowl.<p>"Uh huh. I made it too!"<p>"Errmm..." Again, he peeked from behind his bowl, and looked at his<br/>mother. A claw of ice gripped his heart; his mother was intentionally<br/>avoiding his gaze.<p>Ranma gulped, and eyed Kasumi. He nearly choked when he saw angelic<br/>Kasumi eating at near Saotome-Speed. She didn't take her attention off<br/>her bowl for a second. That was when Ranma realized that the dining<br/>room was awfully quiet.<p>(Oh shit.)<p>"Uhh... emm... that's okay... really. Umm... I'm doin' just great with<br/>the curry..."<p>"Oh c'mon, Ranma," said the youngest Tendo.<p>"Umm... err... I... I... hear squid doesn't go too well with beef!<br/>Curry beef! Yeah! That's it! And I've got curry all over my rice!"<br/>Ranma hurriedly ladled more curry into his bowl. "See? Wouldn't want<br/>to ruin the taste of the delicious curry now, right?"<p>He proceeded to shovel more rice into his mouth when he heard a very<br/>soft "But I made it just for you."<p>Ranma froze. Again. Hesitantly, he turned to look to his right, where<br/>Akane's hopeful gaze made him feel like he was kicking a puppy. A<br/>piggy he wouldn't mind, but a puppy...<p>(Oh man!)<p>"Heh." he offered her a weak smile. "Ermm... sure. Where is it?"<p>"It's right there, dummy," replied Akane happily, all smiles. Ranma<br/>turned to look at the dish he had managed to miss earlier.<p>(Oh my screwed up gods!) His eyes were the size of saucers. The squid<br/>did not look particularly inviting.<p>He turned to Akane, smiling his weak smile. "Uhh... that?"<p>"Uh huh!" she nodded cutely. He gulped. Why did she have to be cute<br/>NOW?<p>(WHAT DO I DO?)<p>Ranma's brain instantly went into overdrive. Neurons and synapses that<br/>had lain dormant since Jusendo were suddenly overworked. Not one grey<br/>cell was left out. The heat from the computations were such that Ranma<br/>started sweating.<p>Then again, Ranma had another reason for sweating.<p>Saotome Ranma found himself seriously in a quandary. On one hand,<br/>there Akane sat, with an expectant look. She was beaming a smile, a<br/>happy smile that Ranma had decided been worth the life of a phoenix<br/>god.<p>On the other hand...<p>(I'm too young to die!)<p>His chopsticks moved forward, very very slowly. Ranma racked and<br/>racked his brain every single millimeter his hand moved. Every trick<br/>he<br/>had, every deception from the very substantial Saotome Library was<br/>pulled out of his memory. None proved sufficient.<p>Nodoka muttered a soft prayer for her beloved son. Tendo was on the<br/>verge of tears; he was about to lose his future son-in-law. Genma was<br/>just thankful it wasn't him. Kasumi ate and ate and ate.<p>Just as Ranma's expression resembled that of a prisoner on death<br/>row, a glint entered his eyes, and his frown turned into a smile.<br/>His slouching shoulders straightened, and he put both his chopsticks<br/>and rice bowl on the table. Everybody was now looking at him.<p>Ranma gripped the serving dish with both hands, and lifted it towards<br/>his face. He paused when the dish was at chest level, and he looked<br/>around. Nobody was breathing.<p>In one smooth motion, he lifted the dish to his mouth and threw his<br/>head back, and swallowed everything - minus the serving dish of course<br/>- in one, big gulp.<p>Jaws could be heard dropping onto the table.<p>He returned the dish to the table, and wiped the corner of his mouth<br/>with the back of his hand. Silence pervaded the dining room.<p>Ranma returned his attention to his curried rice.<p>Akane was the first to shake off the shock. She definitely didn't<br/>expect for him to do THAT. "H- how was it, Ranma?"<p>"Umm? It... it was okay. Though next time, errm.. be... be careful<br/>with... with the... salt! Yeah! That's it! It was okay, but just a<br/>biiiiit too salty. Taste it for salt next time, kay? Keep it up."<p>With that, he continued eating, as the rest of the family slowly<br/>gathered their wits, and Akane beamed.<p>Nobody noticed Ranma fighting to suppress a grimace.<p>==========<p>The evening air was crisp as Ranma made rushed away from the Tendo<br/>dojo. He had offered "I'll be back soon, kay!" immediately after<br/>dinner and left before anyone, namely Akane, could say anything.<p>Saying that Ranma was in a hurry was an understatement. Time spent or<br/>saved made the difference between life and death. His life. His death.<p>He had used Mousse's Hidden Weapons Technique.<p>Ranma had cracked the pattern back at the dinner table. The famed<br/>Saotome analysis skill had come through at the very last moment.<p>Ranma had used his raw chi, and folded Akane's squid away into a<br/>volume of space, pretending that he had swallowed it. The chemically<br/>imbalanced - horribly so - concoction was currently in direct contact<br/>with his chi. Sickening hardly began to describe the feeling.<p>(Shit! Hafta hurry!)<p>Hurry he did. He ran past the neighbouring houses, and finally made it<br/>to the road by the canal. There was no one else around at the moment.<p>(Not too f-) "Ackkhh!"<p>A sharp pain had shot throughout his entire body. He pitched forward,<br/>and fought to stand up.<p>"Hsssssskkkkk!" he hissed, biting back the shout of pain he had been<br/>so tempted to release. The last thing he wanted at the moment was to<br/>attract attention.<p>"Urrgg..." He couldn't stand it anymore, and fell to his knees. He<br/>fought to gather his breath, and shuffled on his knees towards the<br/>fence by the canal. Shakily, he lifted his hand and grabbed the<br/>fence, and tried to get up.<p>Just as he pulled himself up, a great surge of pain coursed throughout<br/>his body. The pain was so great that he couldn't even cry out, and<br/>somehow, despite the fence, he toppled over and fell into the canal.<p>As he fell, Ranma thought of how he had gotten into this mess.<p>(Damn hyper senses...)<p>(Should be up there with Pop's Kijin Raishu Dan...)<p>(Sealed...)<p>(Should have a demonic name too...)<p>(Saotome School of Indiscriminate Grappling...)<p>(The Thousand Fist Sky...)<p>(Eyes of the Demon God...)<p>The last thing that crossed his mind was the image of the woman from<br/>the temple.<p>Ranma lost consciousness, and disappeared under the water.<p>==========<p>To be continued...<p>Author's notes:<p>There! Finally finished it! It's not as good as I wanted it, but hey,<br/>this is only the second chapter of my first ever fic. I'll do better<br/>next time! I hope so, anyway... =)<p>So Ranma finally has his own school of martial arts. Just one<br/>technique, sure, but it still counts. Genma has the Yama Sen Ken and<br/>the Umi Sen Ken, so Ranma gets The Thousand Fist Sky. I don't have the<br/>Japanese translation just yet for 'The Thousand Fist Sky' or 'Eyes of<br/>the Demon God', but I claim dibs on them anyway. I'm gonna try and get<br/>them translated ASAP. Still, you have to wonder... just what good<br/>would it be now that Ranma is fish food? Hmm...<p>I wanted to make it longer, but the whole thing kinda gave me a<br/>headache, ya know. (Read: I was lazy, so I ended the story at a gentle<br/>spot.)<p>You guys aren't mad right? ^_^<p>To Kasumi lovers, sorry that I made her eat at Near Saotome Speed. I<br/>couldn't resist it.. :Þ<p>A _HUGE_ Thank You to Nathan Shuker, Martin Siu, Ranma Saotome and<br/>Magus aka Viper508. They're my pre-readers. You should thank them too.<br/>Without them this fic would suck even worse.<p>Also a big big Thank You to all those who took the trouble to vote for<br/>'When Bakas Learn - Prologue' at the 'Best of Ranma ½ Fanfiction<br/>Awards.' It won first place for the month of August 2001 for the<br/>Mini-Series category! Thank you thank you thank you!<p>By the way, no hurries for the next chapter, right?<p>Copyright © October 2001 by bluefurball
