</div>Achtung! Absolute First Fanfic Alert! Proceed at own Risk!<p>Disclaimer : The cast of Ranma½ does not belong to me, and is used<br/>without permission for non-profit purposes.<p>Comments, suggestions, or just plain that you like it (if you don't,<br/>please tell me why) to bluefurball(at) Flames will be used to<br/>heat up cold burgers.<p>When Bakas Learn<br/>by bluefurball<p>Prologue<p>It was a quiet day at Furinkan High; Kuno got thrashed early in the<br/>morning, with a mere "Sayonara, _Senpai_" from Ranma as he punted the<br/>idiot into orbit. Akane had only shouted at Ranma once, an obviously<br/>half-hearted effort on her part at lunch. Shampoo hadn't turned up to<br/>glomp her Airen at lunch, and Ukyo was visiting her father. Ryoga was<br/>in Indonesia. Mousse was playing fowl. No super-powered martial artist<br/>had come to either prove his superiority over Ranma (pissing match),<br/>or get revenge for a slight - real or imaginary (grudge match), or<br/>even try to kidnap Akane for a bride (match from hell).<p>For the seasoned students of the school, the majority of them were<br/>shifting uneasily in their seats. It had been too quiet. Some of them<br/>had actually begun to pray that Shampoo bash in a wall and start the<br/>normal chain-of-events. Some of the more prudent students (better safe<br/>than sorry) had approached Gosunkugi to buy a good luck charm or a<br/>ward.<p>Excessive? Hardly. It's Friday, and it had been peaceful since Monday,<br/>with only Happosai gracing the hallowed grounds of learning on<br/>Tuesday, and even that was a brief run-through.<p>Disturbing?<p>For the resident Martial Artist God Under 20 of the district, it had<br/>been 5 days of bliss. Peace and quiet. Oh, he did worry about it at<br/>first, but decided that he would just deal with what may come. He had<br/>done it before, after all. Confident? Well, having torn apart and<br/>technically killed an immortal phoenix does wonders to one's<br/>self-esteem. He felt that he could have done without the debacle after<br/>that though. That was just plain stupid. The thought had reiterated<br/>itself in Ranma's head time and again, and he was glad that he kicked<br/>Genma's sorry behind into hospital.<p>That he was preoccupied helped him shrug off any uneasiness he may<br/>have felt.<p>As it was, Ranma sat at his desk in class. Sat and stay awake at his<br/>desk. Despite the fact that lunch had just finished. Not sleeping at<br/>his desk. Poor Fujishima-sensei was sweating, unused to the problem<br/>student paying even a semblance of attention to his class. One would<br/>have said that sweating it was a bit much, but Ranma hadn't slept in<br/>class since Tuesday. He hadn't napped in class at all. Not since<br/>Tuesday.<p>The faculty had collectively procured thirty three of Gosunkugi's<br/>wards.<p>Ranma's classmates had noticed it too. His desk was separated by at<br/>least 3 feet from all adjacent desks, his classmates having inched<br/>their own desks away from him every time he seemed to pay rapt<br/>attention to class. All of them - except Akane and Ranma - sat upright<br/>and were at full attention, eyes darting erratically from time to<br/>time, senses on full alert, waiting for the other shoe to drop and all<br/>hell to start breaking loose.<p>Survival instincts nearly worthy of Genma Saotome.<p>Our pigtailed martial artist, ignorant of ALL of this (were you<br/>expecting otherwise?), was in deep thought. Hard to believe, but there<br/>Ranma sat cross-legged on his chair, each hand on a knee, looking<br/>*quite* contemplative. His brow furrowed, indicating just how much<br/>effort he was putting into his thoughts. His body erect at attention,<br/>and his fingers tapped slightly on his knees in an erratic pattern.<br/>His eyes were slightly unfocused, since the mind was elsewhere. A<br/>modern day Aristotle, one could say.<p>Said pigtailed martial artist was pondering a very intruiging topic.<br/>Three and a half days ago, during Happosai's brief romp through the<br/>school accompanied by his entourage (broom- &amp; mop-wielding females out<br/>for his blood, or any limb), he noticed that the founder of Musabetsu<br/>Kakuto Ryu was heading straight for Nabiki, quite by coincidence.<br/>Ranma was about to leap to Nabiki's rescue, but held himself at the<br/>very last moment. He had never seen Happosai 'attach' himself to<br/>Nabiki, and he was curious how the smug, cold Ice Queen of Furinkan<br/>High would handle such a handling of her person.<p>Ranma was quite surprised to see the shrunken pervert veer away from<br/>Nabiki, with only a glance from the girl to the pervert.<p>"That's it? A glance and Happosai the Pervert runs away from her?"<br/>Ranma's mind was racing. He was the Kirin Kicker, the Trouncer of<br/>Toma, Hurler of Herb, Saffron Slayer - he'd even beat Cologne once,<br/>using the Neko-ken - and Happosai only needs to see him out of the<br/>corner of his perverted eyes and he'd bounce over with a filled bucket<br/>in one hand a brassiere in another. Without any hesitation.<p>And Ol' Hag Nabs sent him veering away with a cursory glance.<p>"People try very hard not to get Nabiki mad at them, but Happosai?"<br/>his mind was trying its very best to process the unexpected input. And<br/>thus, from that point on, Ranma devoted himself to trying to<br/>understand what he had just seen.<p>Three days later (apparently a young, male Saotome mind does not work<br/>too fast outside of battle; he should be thankful, since Genma's<br/>hardly works at all), Ranma had gone through a number of thoughts:<p>People are afraid of Nabiki because she can dig their dirtiest<br/>of dirts and blackmail them with it.<p>Nabiki WILL find any dirt on anyone, given enough time.<p>Since Nabiki takes quite some time to gather information, it<br/>is safe to conclude that she cannot read minds. Therefore, she<br/>must do it the old fashioned way.<p>Most of the time Nabiki always has dirt on someone BEFORE she<br/>has decides to blackmail said person.<p>This means Nabiki is always on the lookout for any useful<br/>information.<p>Nabiki must be very curious.<p>That must mean Nabiki is dangerous because she is a curious<br/>money-grabbing bit-err.. person.<p>Such is the power of the teenaged Saotome mind. Needing only three and<br/>a half days of thought to arrive at such an astute observation.<p>Further credit should be given though, because with a gargantuan leap,<br/>his mind was able to make the connection:<p>Knowledge is Power.<p>People are unwilling to share such knowledge or information<br/>because it would expose their weakness.<p>Thus be very observant and curious, and you shall have<br/>knowldege, and therefore Power whenever you need it.<p>True, anyone else at his age could have arrived at the same conclusion<br/>a much shorter period, but the poor lad DID spend ten years with a<br/>creature of doubtful intelligence outside of primal instincts, with<br/>the name of Saotome Genma. Being dependent on Genma, including for<br/>thought processes, would stunt the growth of anyone's mind.<p>So Ranma sat in his contemplative pose, and made a decision: he would<br/>be very curious as well. He will not turn into another Nabiki: the<br/>very thought of being like her was... repulsive. Even for naive Ranma.<br/>No, he had decided that he would learn as many martial arts techniques<br/>as possible. True, he had always been on the lookout for new<br/>techniques, but this time, he was not going to wait until someone<br/>taught it to him. He would be VOC (Very Observant &amp; Curious), and<br/>learn what the old pervert and ancient mummy had been keeping from<br/>him. Without their knowing.<p>"And I'll be the best martial artist ever for real! I'll beat even the<br/>old ghoul!" he said to himself. Very pleased with himself and the<br/>thought of being even better, he laughed out loud, full of glee and<br/>anticipation.<p>only to realize he was laughing by himself. (Damn, I gotta stop<br/>hanging around pig boy so much. He's actually rubbing onto me!).<br/>Having vowed to do so, he focused his eyes and looked forward.<p>To find Fujishima-sensei pressing his back to the writing board, and<br/>his classmates out of their seats and hugging the walls, each with a<br/>very worried expression. Only Akane remained in her seat, with a<br/>concerned look on her face.<p>"S-s-saotome. B-buckets. Hall. N-now," Fujishima-sensei managed,<br/>finger pointing shakily towards the door.<p>The young Saotome heaved a sigh, and stood up with a tired "Hai,<br/>sensei." At least he got more time to practice thinking.<p>==========<p>Tendo Akane walked out of the school building, school having ended a<br/>few minutes ago.<p>"Hey Akane. What's wrong with Ranma?" quizzed Sayuri, walking<br/>alongside the Tendo girl.<p>"Yeah, Akane! I never thought I'd say this, but Ranma spooks me now -<br/>well just a bit," Yuka eyed her short haired friend.<p>"You're not the only one Yuka. Did you see how pale Fujishima-sensei<br/>was? I thought he was going to have a heart attack!"<p>"I don't know you guys. He's been keeping quiet at home too," the<br/>Tendo heir finally said. "I haven't asked him about it yet. At first I<br/>thought he wants to be nicer to me. You know, keeping quiet rather<br/>than saying anything stupid. But now..." she sighed.<p>"Did it seem like he was doing that? Being nice I mean."<p>"Well, I don't know. But then when he looks at me, he'd smile at me,<br/>and I think that was what he was really doing."<p>"Oooohh Sayuri! Have you EVER seen a girl so in love before? Did you<br/>see the faraway look in her eyes when she said that?"<p>"You're right Yuka! You can hear her voice heavy with worry and<br/>concern and longing for her true love!" the other girl said, her<br/>somewhat dramatic speech spurred by the thoughts of knights in shining<br/>armour.<p>"Can you blame her? Ranma's one big hunk!"<p>"It-it-it's not like that! I was just worried! And he's not a hunk!<br/>He's -"<p>"Hiya AkanwhatdidIdooooooooooo..."<p>Saotome Ranma had earlier decided to approach his fiancee and walk<br/>home with her. Unfortunately he had butted into the conversation at<br/>a... sensitive moment for Akane.<p>Who, by reflex, sent him flying.<p>"Damnit! Arrgghh! I wanted to walk home with him! Baka baka baka!"<br/>One would have a hard time trying to tell if Akane was talking about<br/>Ranma, or herself.<p>"Akane, why don't you rush home and wait for him. Then you can tell<br/>him you're sorry or something."<p>"Sayuri's right. We'll see you tomorrow, okay?"<p>"You're right! I'll see you guys tomorrow! Bye!" Without another word,<br/>Akane rushed home.<p>Yuka blink-blinked with an audible piku-piku. "Sayuri."<p>"Yes Yuka?"<p>"She didn't even say her usual 'why should I apologize to that<br/>baka?'".<p>Sayuri nodded, eyes still on her friend rushing home. "Yuka."<p>"Yes Sayuri?"<p>"Our friend is in love."<p>*sniff* "I know. Isn't it beautiful?"<p>And thus, they said their goodbyes for the day, and went on home.<br/>Leaving one to wonder if smashing one's fiance into the sky was a<br/>beautiful thing.<p>==========<p>"Uncute, uncute, uncute tomboy! What the hell was that for?" Ranma was<br/>flying through Nerima airspace, courtesy of Akane.<p>He decided to enjoy the moment and take in the view, turning his back<br/>to the ground and looked up a the blue, slightly clouded sky. A<br/>beautiful afternoon. He should consider lucky, he guessed, since not<br/>many people get this perspective. There's Kuno, but... Ranma's mind<br/>prudently decided not to go there.<p>The pigtailed youth was taking in the view when he suddenly felt the<br/>change of trajectory as he passed the apex of his parabolic flight<br/>path. With a "What the? It's too soon!" he looked to the ground for<br/>reference.<p>(What? Is she sick or something? This ain't even half the height she<br/>normally kicks me to! Aww man, I hope she's alright. Have to find out<br/>later back home.)<p>Ranma didn't realize that he did not even try to deny to himself that<br/>he was somewhat worried about his short-haired fiancee. Nor did he<br/>realize that he just called the Tendo dojo, his home. One could argue<br/>that he's got it bad for the Tendo girl.<p>Another could argue it's the newspaper that somehow found its way into<br/>his face.<p>Distracted, Ranma couldn't take the necessary measures for a proper<br/>landing. And thus he fell into the ground.<p>Onto a mattress, conveniently placed to break the fall of super<br/>martial artists who somehow ticked off their fiances. It is Nerima<br/>after all.<p>"Huh? Mattress?" he looked around. (Oh right, Tofu-sensei's. The<br/>tomboy even sent me to a friend's. Damn, I guess I should do something<br/>nice for her later. Hmmm. Let's see if Tofu's around.)<p>==========<br/>-A few hours later.-<p>Ranma pushed open the front gates of the Tendo dojo, in deep thought,<br/>again, this time about what the good doctor had told him. In such deep<br/>thought was he, that he had forgotten to find Akane as he had<br/>orginally planned. By autopilot he walked into the house, kicked off<br/>his shoes, and went into the kitchen.<p>To be broken out of his reverie when he felt himself hugged TIGHT.<p>"Gaah! Oh hiya mom. Sorry bout that. For a moment I thought you were<br/>an Amazon," he said as he hugged his mother in return. (You sure hug<br/>like one. I knew I couldn't have gotten my strength from Pop alone).<p>"Oh I'm sorry dear, but your mother is so proud to have such a manly<br/>son," Nodoka said, and started to fuss over Ranma like only a mother<br/>seperated from her child for ten years could. Soon Ranma was sitting<br/>at the kitchen table with tea and snacks, along with Kasumi and his<br/>mother.<p>Normally someone his age - a boy no less - would prefer to sit with<br/>someone his age and gender. To Ranma, anyone who isn't out to marry<br/>him or kill him is good enough for him.<p>Especially if they had food.<p>They made small talk, not something Ranma knew much about. He was<br/>learning from his mother, albeit slowly. Among other things that other<br/>people take for granted. Table manners, for instance. Common courtesy.<br/>Not to mention the common sense to shut up rather than say the first<br/>thing that came to mind in delicate situations.<p>Honest to goodness skills that people should have, but quite a number<br/>don't. Ranma gets used as an example just because he stands out from<br/>the rest of the crowd.<p>Thanking his mother and Kasumi, he left for the dojo, hoping to try<br/>and practice what Tofu had explained earlier. Closing the shoji behind<br/>him, he sat down cross-legged on the floor and recalled the kind<br/>doctor's words.<p>(To learn without being thought, you have to touch, see, hear,<br/>smell and feel your intended sensei. Merely observing your<br/>target will not work; you must do it at a level so high that<br/>you _experience_ what they do. From there, all will be<br/>revealed. Your quarry will not co-operate, so you have to<br/>observe from afar. There lies your first goal: to hone your<br/>senses so that you can experience what your target is<br/>experiencing from a distance. Most preferably without them<br/>noticing you. Ki alone would not suffice; adepts like Cologne<br/>and Happosai would sense you prodding them in no time flat. To<br/>enhance your senses, you must understand them. Know your<br/>surroundings. Use your ki to feel your surroundings. Compare<br/>them with what your senses tell you. From there you can<br/>understand your senses. If you succeed, you will know them for<br/>what they are, and can work to improve them. But only then.)<p>Ranma smiled at the thought of the friendly doctor's words.<br/>Tofu-sensei had even shown him some text on the subject of senses.<br/>Unfortunately the texts had hardly shed any light on the matter, and<br/>Ranma had to stick to Tofu's words.<p>He had asked Tofu why the doctor couldn't do what Ranma wanted to do,<br/>since he did know the general technique after all. Tofu had turned to<br/>Ranma, smiled, and said "My old professor once said to me: 'Those who<br/>know, do. Those who don't, teach.' I only know the theory Ranma-kun,<br/>but I don't really know how to do it properly. So I teach. To you."<p>Ranma sighed just slightly, resigned to the fact that he had his work<br/>cut out for him. With that, he closed his eyes, and hoped that it<br/>would not take too long.<p>He might miss dinner.<p>==========<p>"Auntie, where's Ranma?"<p>"I'm not sure Akane-chan. He had tea with me when he came back home. I<br/>thought you wanted to join us."<p>"I-" she paused. She was about to deny that she did want to have tea<br/>Ranma, but couldn't bring herself to vocalize her denials for Nodoka's<br/>piercing gaze dared her to be less than honest; gentle, but piercing<br/>nonetheless.<p>"Hai. I wanted to, but he took so long, so I went up to my room. I- I<br/>fell asleep. Sorry, auntie."<p>"Now Akane-chan, there's no need to apologize. Besides, you can feast<br/>your eyes on my manly son soon enough," the Saotome matriach said, a<br/>mischievous glint reaching her eyes.<p>"I- I-"<p>"Don't worry dear, you'll see him at dinner. You know how he is,"<br/>Nodoka decided it was quite endearing to see her future<br/>daughter-in-law get flustered like that. Well, it was a bit fun, too.<p>"But- but-"<p>"You feel that that is too long? Oh how lucky my son is! To get a<br/>fiancee who admit she misses him for every moment he's not with her!<br/>Oh Akane-chan, you make me so happy!" she was quite relentless.<p>Akane's face has adopted a new shade: pale and red. There she was,<br/>being embarrassed by her future mother-in-law (the red), and the older<br/>female was practically _squealing_ with delight, for all to hear.<p>For ALL to hear (yes, the paleness).<p>"Oh my! Imouto-chan, you've admitted your feelings for Ranma?" Kasumi<br/>appeared out of nowhere.<p>"Oh happy day! My baby girl has finally declared her love for Ranma!<br/>She's going to get married! Bwaaahhhhhhhhhh!" Fountain-san too.<p>"There, there father, don't cry like that."<p>"At last Tendo, our schools will be joined! Our dreams will come<br/>true!" Guess who.<p>"Ahem."<p>A small sound, but it was enough. Nodoka had sent the two idiots out<br/>of the room hastily.<p>Akane let out a small sigh of relief. At least Nabiki didn't hear the<br/>commotion.<p>"Oh my, auntie. What do you think Nabiki will say when she hears about<br/>this?"<p>The youngest Tendo felt like taking a long training trip. Alone.<p>(Well, not alone. I want Ranma to -... What am I saying?)<p>Nodoka and Kasumi watched with quiet smiles as Akane turned red as a<br/>tomato and rushed to her room.<p>==========<p>Ranma was sweating. A normal enough occurrance for him. It was just<br/>that normally, when Ranma was sweating, he would most likely be<br/>bouncing off the walls or roofs or firing chi-blasts or running from<br/>Akane (he'd sweat a lot more if Akane was carrying a plate of HER food<br/>for him).<p>At the moment, he was sitting in a lotus position on the floor, and...<br/>that was it. He was sweating by sitting down.<p>Well, he seemed to be merely sitting down in the dojo. But for the<br/>past 3 hours, he had been extending his chi, trying to corellate the<br/>various stimuli surrounding him with his actual experiences. Even with<br/>Tofu's earlier instructions, he found it to be very, very hard.<p>The concept was easy enough. A certain stimulus, for example light,<br/>would be interpreted in a certain way by the brain. By enveloping<br/>oneself in a layer of chi, one could detect an incoming stimulus as it<br/>passes through the field of chi. The stimulus, let's say green light,<br/>would leave an imprint in the chi field that would be exclusive to<br/>green light. The light would then reach the retina, and be interpreted<br/>by the brain as being green. Thus, the practitioner would know that<br/>what had passed through the chi field was green light, and he would<br/>recognise green light in its raw form.<p>That would mean that his eyes would be wherever he extended his chi<br/>to. However, the point was to avoid detection by ki-adepts, and such a<br/>technique would be useless. Therefore, if one were to channel and<br/>focus chi tightly into the cornea, one would be able to sense every<br/>stimulus, including ambient energy that bombard the cornea; even those<br/>that does not make it to the retina.<p>The perfect eye.<p>By adjusting the amount of chi focused, one would be able to select<br/>what stimulus to highlight, and which to ignore. Which sense should be<br/>hyper-sensitive, which one to dull. With enough practice, the entire<br/>electromagnetic spectrum would be visible, from radiofrequency on one<br/>end of the spectrum, to gamma rays on the other. Wihout harming the<br/>precious retina.<p>Billions and billions of yen worth of equipment in one little organic<br/>package.<p>This principle could be applied to all other senses. Should one gain<br/>complete mastery the technique for all the senses, he (or she) could<br/>hear light, feel sound, see the taste of food, touch scents, and many,<br/>many more. Chi and ki would be seen, heard, smelt, tasted and felt;<br/>from there all secrets would eventually become unravelled. And all<br/>done internally, without screaming one's intention to ki-adepts.<p>An awe-inspiring ability. Ranma would be able to become quite well<br/>informed.<p>At the moment however, Ranma continued to sweat. It was turning out to<br/>be harder than he had thought.<p>"This," he sighed "will take some time."<p>==========<p>(Just WHAT is that baka doing in there?) a certained short-haired girl<br/>in the Tendo house fumed to herself.<p>(It's been seven days! Seven whole days!) she was currently sitting at<br/>the porch overlooking the koi pond.<p>(Coming out only to eat, sleep, do Hinako-sensei's homework!) her brow<br/>furrowed cutely as she focused her thoughts on a certain someone.<p>(He did come out three days ago, but that was just to flirt with that<br/>damn bimbo and that- that- that crossdressing cook!) she started to<br/>clench her small fists on her lap.<p>(And when Ryouga-kun came to visit yesterday, all he did was pick on<br/>him! That jerk!) her knuckles popped as she clenched her fists<br/>tighter.<p>(He is SUCH a JERK! Keeping to himself like that! Like we're not good<br/>enough for him to talk to!) a slightly visible aura lit up around her.<p>(He- he-) the aura flared up considerably. Had anyone seen it, they<br/>would have taken a step or five backwards.<p>(He doesn't talk to me anymore,) thought Tendo Akane sadly, as her<br/>shoulders drooped and her anger deflated.<p>(Oh Ranma you jerk. Please talk to me.)<p>"There Akane, don't look so sad," said Saotome Nodoka as she appeared<br/>at the girl's side. Akane was a bit startled, but checked herself from<br/>flinching visibly.<p>The older woman gathered her in a motherly embrace. "You know how he<br/>is."<p>Akane nodded. A comfortable silence wafted through the air.<p>"But I must admit. I'm beginning to worry for my son as well. It _has_<br/>been quite some time since he started... whatever it is he's doing."<p>"I wish I knew what he was doing. This is the first time that he's<br/>kept quiet like this. Usually if he's learning a new technique, we at<br/>least _knew_ what he's doing. The Kaatchu Tenshin Amaguriken, the<br/>Hiryuu Shoten Ha - even the Mouko Takabisha. At least we knew what he<br/>was doing. That he was alright," said the girl, in a small voice.<p>(Oh dear. Akane seems to be very upset.) Nodoka turned her gaze<br/>towards the dojo. (Ranma my son, as much as I am proud of your pursuit<br/>of the Art, I hope you come out of that dojo soon.)<p>She looked down at Akane, who was leaning into her chest, obviously<br/>cherishing Nodoka's motherly embrace; it had been too long since she<br/>had had the luxury. "Don't worry dear. Maybe it's something only he<br/>can see," she said, not knowing how right she was. "We'll just have to<br/>trust him," she said with a smile.<p>Akane noticed the smile in Nodoka's voice and looked up into the older<br/>woman's face, a small smile of her own forming. "I guess you're r-"<p>Her speech was cut off by a jubilant "YATTA!"<p>==========<p>He'd done it! He'd finally done it! After days of gruelling<br/>meditation, he'd finally done it!<p>It wasn't the gradual increase he expected. One moment, he sat in the<br/>darkened dojo. Then suddenly, enlightenment came, and his world<br/>exploded into colours and sounds and smells and sensations that he<br/>felt and heard and saw and smelled and tasted from head to toe! His<br/>mental preparation spared him from collapsing in agony from the<br/>overwhelming experience, but nothing could contain his euphoria.<p>The feeling was indescribable! He saw more of everything in every<br/>direction. He felt that he could hear the heart-beat of a mouse ten<br/>miles away! He could-<p>"Yuck!"<p>He could smell himself.<p>"Bathroom here I come! Damn, that was hard work!" he said as he cut<br/>off the excess chi to his senses - except his cornea - and opened<br/>the dojo doors. He paused as he took in his surroundings.<p>Everything was different. Same, but different. He saw everything<br/>differently. Deciding to test his new abilities, he jumped onto the<br/>perimeter wall, and then onto the dojo roof. He let loose a bit of<br/>chi.<p>He took a sharp breath. From the elevated vantage point, the<br/>experience of early evening Nerima was even more breathtaking.<p>Colors everywhere, from walls, roofs, birds flying above. Sensations<br/>from various distances; he lifted his hand, and reached out.<p>And gasped. He could _touch_ the neighbours roof. From where he stood.<br/>By merely touching the light waves that bounced off it towards him!<br/>The shingle felt slightly coarse, a toll it took from the weather. He<br/>not only felt the texture, but also the colour. He could feel a<br/>residual amount of chi on the shingle, probably where a bird had<br/>landed some time ago.<p>He reached out again, this time at nothing in particular. He could<br/>feel the differing temperatures of air at various levels; a minute<br/>variance from each other, but he felt it all the same.<p>He heard the laughter of a girl, and he turned around, wondering what<br/>a girl was doing on the roof with him. To find no one there. Again he<br/>heard the girl, replying to her friend, who was also out of sight.<br/>From his vantage point, he searched the roads around the dojo. Two<br/>boys, and elderly man, a middle aged housewife with her son was all he<br/>saw. No girls. He could hear people out of sight.<p>Deciding to test his new skills further, he focused more chi into his<br/>cornea.<p>And immediately got a close up of a caterpillar munching on a leaf.<p>(Huh?) He cut off his chi, and looked for the tree on which the little<br/>insect-to-be could possibly be on.<p>(Huh? Where's the tree? There's nothing but roofs and roofs. The park<br/>ain't in that direction. That ain't the way to school either.)<p>Puzzled, he slowly channeled his chi, giving him the impression that<br/>he's slowly zooming across the rooftops using an expensive camera.<p>(Whu..?) he managed, as his view passed a prominent sign in the<br/>shopping district, a good fifteen blocks away from the dojo.<p>He continued for about twenty seconds, until his view came to a tree.<br/>Very slowly he zoomed in just a bit more, until he came to spy on a<br/>lone catterpillar, fat and green, munching away happily on a leaf.<p>Dampening the chi supply, he considered the tree. (That... that tree<br/>is... more than three miles away! No way! This-)<p>"Son? Are you alright?"<p>"Huh?" An articulate response.<p>He looked down, and saw his mother and Akane standing on the stone<br/>path towards, the dojo, looking up at him on the roof.<p>Again he gasped. He saw his mother as he had never seen her before.<br/>Upon the regal image of Saotome Nodoka, he saw - he _felt_ a multitude<br/>of colours, emotions. He felt concern. He felt relief. He felt the<br/>untold love of a mother for her child.<p>Although he had never been cold at heart to his mother, Ranma's heart<br/>melted, and jumped down right in front of her, giving her a tight<br/>embrace. The contact made him feel his mother even more, but the dam<br/>truly broke when he felt his mother return his embrace, flooding him<br/>his senses; he knew there and then, that his mother was proud of him<br/>no matter what others might say, and would have him no other way.<p>(I love you mother.)<p>(I love you my son.)<p>"Umm.."<p>A gesture was made to attract attention, and attract their attention<br/>it did. Breaking the embrace, he looked at Akane, hyper senses still<br/>active.<p>And got an eyeful of Akane's aura.<p>"Kami-sama..." the pigtailed boy whispered. THIS, he had not expected.<p>-End prologue-<p>Note : A HUGE thank you to my pre-readers<p>Nathan Shuker - who helped show me just how atrocious my<br/>grammar and spelling really were<p>Ranma Saotome - who gave me  suggestions on how to write<br/>the fic better.<p>
