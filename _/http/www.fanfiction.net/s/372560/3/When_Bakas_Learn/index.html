</div>Disclaimers and Author Rants apply. Please read Foot Notes.<p>When Bakas Learn<br/>by bluefurball<p>Chapter 2<p>"What happened?"<p>Silence.<p>"Where am I?"<p>Even more silence.<p>"Where is everybody?"<p>The silence was getting really annoying.<p>"Why is it so dark here?"<p>As if in answer, a faint blue glow appeared.<p>"Huh? Wha-?"<p>A very curious-looking construct materialized, and it hung in mid-air.<br/>That, at best, was a poor description; there was no air to speak of,<br/>nor was there any point of reference for the construct to float above,<br/>under, inside, or out of.<p>It was merely there.<p>What 'it' was also begged an explanation. It was like someone had<br/>woven a mat out of thin strips of soft blue light, and then used the<br/>mat as paper for an elaborate origami sculpture. Each strip of light<br/>was probably polarised, considering that it was darker wherever two<br/>or more strips overlapped each other.<p>The outline of the structure was a perfect sphere, but the structure<br/>itself resembled a sea-urchin, bristling with soft blue thorns. It<br/>was semi-opaque, and one could see that it was hollow, the way an<br/>origami model should be. The similarity ended there, however, for it<br/>was plain to see that the folds inside the conical thorns and body of<br/>the structure were stretched this way and that, undulating<br/>ceaselessly. Where the folds were stretched, slight gaps could be seen<br/>between the blue strips, and no two folds would be stretched the same<br/>amount. Even the shading of each strip would differ, depending on its<br/>density and how many other strips it obstructed the viewer from<br/>seeing.<p>Everything was unique, each had a different purpose, the sum of which<br/>was the ethereal construct.<p>"...What is this?"<p>No answer came.<p>"What does it do?"<p>Silence.<p>"Damnit! Someone answer me!"<p>Annoyance gave way to budding anger, fuelled by confusion. A shout of<br/>frustration should ease the anger somewhat, and quell any and all<br/>worries. It should also crush any fear, but that was moot, since Manly<br/>Martial Artists do not feel any fear.<p>A good strong shout was needed, but none came. The appearance of a<br/>second construct prevented anything more than slack-jawed staring,<br/>coupled with mental gaping. While the first construct was beautiful<br/>and enchanting, the second was awesome.<p>The newcomer appeared next to the first, dwarfing it by at least a<br/>factor of ten. It looked like a giant golf ball, pocked with small<br/>bumps instead of dimples. They were thorny bumps, for each of them<br/>were indeed a replica of the first construct, gathered into the<br/>outline of a sphere and cut across their equator by a giant<br/>translucent bubble. The bubble was of the same blue mat and was<br/>hollow, just like the first construct. However, where in the first<br/>construct the hollow chamber housed folds of the model, the huge<br/>chamber of the second was filled with helixes that were tightly<br/>wound, bridging two thorny bumps, each on the opposite side of the<br/>sphere. All the helixes passed through the center, and the point of<br/>convergence looked solid, shining like a neon bulb.<p>Awesome.<p>Despite the complexity of the constructs, the subconscious somehow had<br/>no doubt that each of them was the product of just one giant mat, each<br/>skillfully folded and contorted beyond belief.<p>"One big origami..."<p>Again, as if in answer, something happened.<p>The first construct began unravelling. It split at its equator, and<br/>from there unravelled the folds, then the thorns, until there was only<br/>the mat of soft blue light.<p>Not to be outdone, the second construct also began to unravel. The<br/>helixes unwound, and the giant bubble flattened out into a bumpy mat.<br/>That unravelled even more, ridding itself of the thorny bumps, finally<br/>coming to rest as one giant mat, so alluringly blue.<p>"Kami-sama..."<p>There was no helping it. The light show was too spectacular to remain<br/>aloof and detached.<p>The light show was also not over. The giant mat started to fold by<br/>itself, this way and that, very gracefully, until it morphed into its<br/>final form. The remaining mat followed suit, and performed its own<br/>dance, folding, contorting, until it reached its final form.<p>"What is this? What does all of this mean? _What_?"<p>While the feelings of awe and astoundment remained, a new one arose.<p>Familiarity.<p>Both the constructs seemed familiar, especially the first one. A<br/>mystery: how could something so strange be so familiar? There must be<br/>an explanation... but what? There must be-<p>"ARRGH!"<p>Pain? It couldn't be. It felt like it came from the first construct.<br/>_From_ it? That didn't make any sense. There shouldn-<p>"ARR-"<p>****<p>"-RRGHH!"<p>Saotome Ranma screamed. It felt like someone was pushing red hot<br/>pokers into his skin. He had come out of unconsciousness many times<br/>before, but never like this. He was used to seeing only blackness,<br/>then gradually regaining his senses.<p>This time pain flooded his every nerve, and kicked his senses from<br/>zero to overdrive in half a second.<p>"What's wrong with me?"<p>He was panting hard. Sweat ran down his face in heavy trickles. Ranma<br/>tried to get his bearings when another jolt of pain kneed him in the<br/>gut. The jolt sent him clutching his sides, curled like a foetus on<br/>the ground.<p>"Unngghh..."<p>Ranma did what he could to bite back a scream. Screaming was not<br/>manly. It also spoke of a lack of control, and he needed all the<br/>control he had to figure out what was happening to him. Still curled<br/>on his side, he forced himself to breath evenly, when he felt the<br/>slight twinge in his abdomen.<p>Another jolt was coming.<p>(Shitshitshit! What the hell is going on? That damn Ryouga doesn't<br/>hit this hard! This feels like... like...)<p>His eyes shot open as realization took him, then he shut them again,<br/>this time in evident concentration and effort. A shudder passed<br/>through him, a warning of the incoming seizure.<p>Ranma disengaged the First Construct.<p>All of a sudden a small portal appeared in thin air, and a pile of...<br/>something fell through. The portal disappeared as quickly as it had<br/>appeared.<p>Immediately a great sense of relief washed over Ranma as the pain<br/>disappeared. He took a few deep breaths, and opened a single eye to<br/>see what it was that had caused him so much pain.<p>It was Akane's squid.<p>Ranma sighed. (Stupid Tomboy. Nearly killed me for real...) He then<br/>snickered weakly. (Stupid me. Can't believe I forgot that I folded her<br/>squid. That must've been some fall...)<p>(Fall?)<p>He had fallen into the canal. But the ground under him was only<br/>slightly damp, and he was still male. Not the standard outcome of<br/>falling into the canal. Confused, he slowly got up and looked around.<br/>There was nothing to be seen, except the wall of water.<p>*Thump*<p>Ranma could only gape as he sat where he fell on his rear. He was<br/>indeed in the canal. He was, however, not in the water.<p>He was in the center of a perfect circle, about two meters in radius.<br/>As he stood up, he saw that he was in the canal, and as the water<br/>reached the invisible boundary, the water... went elsewhere. There was<br/>no other way to describe it, since the water did not flow around the<br/>invisible barrier. The water was chest level - it must be raining<br/>heavily upstream - and he could see the water _disappear_ as it hit<br/>the barrier, from the surface to the canal bed.<p>Turning around, he saw that the water on the other side of the barrier<br/>flowed smoothly, as if there had been nothing to impede it.<p>"What the hell..." he muttered. He had never come across anything like<br/>this. Maybe if he studied the barrier closer. Ranma took slow steps<br/>towards the invisible boundary.<p>He stopped after seven steps. There was no way he could reach the<br/>barrier. It moved as he did. It stopped as he did.<p>(I'm the cause of this?)<p>As he stood and pondered the matter, a movement at the corner of his<br/>eyes caught his attention. Turning, he saw that it was a red plastic<br/>bag, empty and floating on the surface of the water.<p>It was heading straight for him. Straight for the unseen barrier.<p>Ranma stood there, very still, not taking his eyes off the piece of<br/>trash as it came closer. He would not blink; he knew something was<br/>going to happen when the bag reached the barrier, and he wanted to see<br/>what it was.<p>The bag came closer.<p>Closer.<p>Just a foot away from the barrier now...<p>Three inches...<p>One...<p>Right before his very eyes, the piece of trash shrunk, and then<br/>disappeared entirely.<p>"Huh?"<p>Shrunk? Disappeared? It didn't make any sense. Nothing that evening<br/>had made sense.<p>Ranma started to scratch the base of his pigtail, wondering about what<br/>just happened, when instinct made him turn around.<p>The same plastic bag continued to float away from the edge of the<br/>barrier, on the opposite side from where it had disappeared, still in<br/>the same shape as it had been earlier.<p>(H- how? Where...)<p>He shook his head. Nothing was making any sense.<p>With that, he jumped out of the canal, and onto the road besides it.<br/>He started to make his way back to the dojo, too confused to realise<br/>that that was the first time that he had fallen into the canal and<br/>remained male.<p>Suddenly he froze in mid-step. "Wait a minute!"<p>(If that first blue thing caused the hidden weapon move, then<br/>maybe...)<p>Ranma closed his eyes, and after a moment felt what he was looking<br/>for. A sudden focus crossed his expression, and a moment later he felt<br/>as if someone had pulled away layers of uncomfortably hot blankets.<p>(Ahh... much better. What the heck was- was...)<p>Ranma suddenly felt very tired, and his eyes wouldn't stay open.<p>(...was...)<p>He keeled, and everything went black.<p>Again.<p>**********<p>Darkness.<p>Light.<p>A familiar ceiling.<p>"Damn. Who the hell shoved their lifetime supply of being knocked out<br/>onto me?" Ranma sighed.<p>Of course, coming from someone who was coming out of unconsciousness,<br/>it sounded more like "dmooshvdrpplynokontmehuuuuuh".<p>He waited for a few minutes, allowing his view to focus properly.<p>"Heh. Toufuu's place. I could recognize that ceiling with a blindfold<br/>on now," he muttered to himself. He paused, gathered his breath, and<br/>started to move into a sitting position.<p>"No, no, no, there will be none of that for you," he heard a gentle<br/>voice, accompanying soft footsteps that seemingly appeared out of<br/>nowhere. Ranma felt a hand on his chest, gently pushing him back down.<p>"Oh, hiya Doc."<p>"Hello yourself, Ranma. Glad that you've decided to wake up and join<br/>the world again." Ranma was looking up at the ceiling, too tired to<br/>look around, but he could hear the smile in Toufuu's voice.<p>"Yeah, well, it wasn't much of a nap. I don't think I wanted it in the<br/>first place."<p>"Nap?" the smile in the voice turned into concern. "Being unconscious<br/>for three days qualifies more as a coma then a 'nap', Ranma-kun."<p>Ranma whirled his head to look at Toufuu "What! Three-"<p>"Ah! Please don't do that Ranma. Your motor function is just coming<br/>back. It wouldn't do to shock them."<p>The pigtailed boy eased his tensed muscles and exhaled loudly.<p>"Yes Ranma. Three days. It's Tuesday evening now."<p>"Crap."<p>"That quite summed up my response when Fuumei-san and her son brought<br/>you in."<p>"Who-"<p>"My regulars, though not as regular as you."<p>"Oh. Heh."<p>"I'm going to get you something to eat, then you're going to rest.<br/>When you have enough energy, by that I mean when _I_ decide that<br/>you're strong enough," Ranma smiled weakly at that, " you're going to<br/>tell me what you were doing that almost exhausted your chi supply<br/>completely."<p>**********<br/>-The Next Day-<p>Ranma finished the last of his late breakfast, and sat back, patting<br/>his tummy. It was just after ten o'clock, the wall clock told him. He<br/>was feeling a lot better than the night before, and the color of his<br/>face showed it.<p>Toufuu came in, bearing a clipboard.<p>"Finished with your patient, Doc?"<p>The young doctor nodded. "Yes. My next appointment is at eleven<br/>thirty. That gives us some time for a little discussion, don't you<br/>think?"<p>Ranma grinned. "That means I'm strong enough?"<p>Toufuu smiled back. "Only to talk, mind you."<p>"Just between you and me doc, I don't really feel like doing anything<br/>else."<p>The older man nodded in understanding. "That's why I haven't told<br/>anyone you've come out of your coma."<p>Ranma let out an exaggerated sigh of relief. "Thanks Doc. I prefer not<br/>to have a circus shoved into my face right now."<p>"Now, now Ranma. Your family is just concerned, so are your friends.<br/>At least the female half is."<p>"Mom and the Tendos are alright, but the rest are just gonna be a<br/>pain."<p>The doctor merely nodded. "Akane stayed by your bed. She said that it<br/>was her fault."<p>"Huh? She did?"<p>Toufuu nodded again. "I sent her back though, after you stabilized on<br/>Monday."<p>Ranma remained quiet.<p>"Was it her fault, Ranma?"<p>"Huh? Oh. Uhh... partly. The squid was standard Akane. It got real bad<br/>because I folded it."<p>"Excuse me Ranma, did you say folded?"<p>"Uhh... I'm not really sure how to describe it right now. I used<br/>Mousse's Hidden Weapons technique when I pretended to eat the squid.<br/>Heh. Next time I'll just eat the damn thing."<p>The doctor raised an eyebrow. "Mousse's technique, Ranma? He taught<br/>you?"<p>The pigtailed boy grinned. "You remember me asking you how to learn<br/>martial arts moves without asking?"<p>Toufuu's face lit up. "Of course I do! You've mastered it?"<p>Ranma's face was of absolute pride. "Musabetsu Kakuto, Saotome Ryu,<br/>Ten Sen Ken, Kijin Shikaku."<p>"Kijin Shikaku? Demon God Eyesight?"<p>"Friendly kami wouldn't leave me sleeping for three days, I think."<p>"Maybe not. Congratulations, Ranma," said Toufuu, as he reached and<br/>gently clapped Ranma's shoulder. "To be honest, I didn't think you'd<br/>learn it this fast. Or at all. Don't take it the wrong way, but your<br/>Kijin Shikaku is pretty much the Holy Grail of martial arts, Ranma. If<br/>I had to bet on anyone mastering the move, I'd bet on you. But<br/>still... it hasn't even been two weeks since you asked me about it."<p>The young Saotome had a look of friendly smugness. "Well, when you're<br/>the best..."<p>Toufuu smiled at his young patient. "No arguments from me," he said.<p>"Here's how you do it Doc. First you gotta-"<p>"Hold it, Ranma," Toufuu halted him. "I don't want to know."<p>"HUH? But Doc, if it weren't for y-"<p>The doctor finally silenced Ranma with another gesture. Toufuu could<br/>only smile at Ranma's confused look.<p>"I know I said it's the Holy Grail of martial arts. Mastering the move<br/>will open up many great opportunities for you. But it's not for me."<p>Seeing Ranma getting more confused, Toufuu continued.<p>"You're not the only one with an interesting childhood Ranma. Come to<br/>think of it, I was a bit like you. My father trained me since I was<br/>very young."<p>"Musta been. You're good at the Art, Doc."<p>Offering a smile and a nod, Toufuu continued "It's just that I've<br/>learned that if you live for the Art, the Art will come to you. If you<br/>live for the challenge, the challenge will come to you."<p>"Huh?"<p>"Living for the Art, and for the challenge, will make you very<br/>skillful. However, there is a price."<p>"Uhh... what price?"<p>"I don't know Ranma... maybe Jusenkyou curses, multiple fiancees,<br/>rivals, monsters, ghosts. Sound familiar?"<p>"You're saying..."<p>"Do you think you'd be as good as you are today if you didn't have all<br/>the excitement thrown at you?"<p>"Uhh.. yes?"<p>The doctor grinned. "I'm not questioning your ability Ranma. I'm just<br/>saying you're as good as you are because of continuing challenges. You<br/>live for the Art, and for the challenge. And so the Art comes to you,<br/>as do the challenges. The better and more skilled you are, the bigger<br/>and tougher the challenges."<p>"Ahh... You don't like the challenges, Doc?"<p>"I used to revel in them. Now I want a normal life Ranma. There came a<br/>point for me that the excitement was too much."<p>"What happened? The clinic collapsed too much?"<p>Toufuu chuckled. "Nothing like that, but close."<p>"I wanna show you I'm grateful, ya know Doc? I mean, if it weren't for<br/>you, I wouldn't even have learned it."<p>Pushing up his glasses up the bridge of his nose, Toufuu said "The<br/>only thanks I need from you Ranma, is that you succeed, and that you<br/>put your knowledge to good use."<p>"If Nabiki said that, Kasumi would call the hospital to have her<br/>checked up in a snap," said Ranma, grinning while snapping his<br/>fingers.<p>"K- Ka- Ka- Ka-"<p>Ranma paled. "Oh shit." Toufuu's glasses started to fog over.<p>"DOC! FIRE! THE CLINIC'S ON FIRE!"<p>"Huh? Fire? Where, Ranma-kun?" asked the doctor, his glasses clearing.<p>"Nowhere Doc," gasped Ranma, one hand clenched over his heart.<p>"Anyway, as I was saying Ranma, thank you for offering to teach me<br/>your technique. But, I have to decline. I like my quiet, normal life."<p>"Oh. Umm, kay. You tell me if you change your mind, kay Doc?"<p>"I will, Ranma."<p>There was a few moments of companiable silence, which Ranma passed by<br/>regulating his breathing in an attempt to speed up his healing. Toufuu<br/>was in deep thought.<p>"Ranma."<p>"Yeah, Doc?"<p>"You very nearly died. Nearly all your chi was spent. Did Mousse's<br/>technique really take up that much energy?"<p>"Hmm... naah. Not really, Doc. The only trouble the technique gave me<br/>was giving the squid direct contact with my chi. But after I undid<br/>that first blue thing, I-"<p>"Wait a second. Blue thing? Ranma, I think you better tell me<br/>everything that happened. Don't leave out anything."<p>**********<p>Toufuu sat, leaning against the countertop. He gently massaged both<br/>his temples with both his hands, lost in thought.<p>Delivered to his doorstep, nearly dead.<p>Recuperating a week faster than he had anticipated, even with his<br/>experience treating the boy.<p>Revealing that he had mastered the Holy Grail of the Art. Not giving<br/>much thought to having mastered something other people have died<br/>trying to learn, but instead enthused about having stolen a rival's<br/>prized technique, which in comparison pales to said Holy Grail of the<br/>Art.<p>Had seen in crisp detail what he believed had to have been a chi<br/>pattern/structure. Two chi patterns/structures. Nobody had ever<br/>recorded such a feat.<p>Discovered in person - even if by accident - a mind-boggling martial<br/>arts technique, something akin to one that he had read about only<br/>once, in the translation of a translation _of_ a translation of a<br/>secret text that had predated Japan herself.<p>Defied death by drowning, by virtue of said mind-boggling technique.<br/>Ironically, the technique itself nearly did him in.<p>It was like a bizarre resumé.<p>As experienced and open minded as Toufuu was, he was getting a slight<br/>headache. At the moment he was contemplating the accidental discovery<br/>of a superb technique.<p>Accidents happen all the time, he knew that much. Accidents are as<br/>much the mother of Invention as Necessity, if not more. But this...<p>The very magnitude of the 'accident' wanted to make him reach out for<br/>some aspirin.<p>****<p>Chaos.<p>It would have smiled at Toufuu, if it could.<p>Had it been able to, it would have said smugly, "What did you expect?<br/>It did not matter if his time had come or not, I'm still not done with<br/>him. Yes, I saved him. The boy has a lot to do still. He is my avatar,<br/>after all."<p>"He's my very best."<p>"He will be your greatest."<p>Had Chaos been able to, that was.<p>****<p>Saotome Ranma sat on his bed, thinking about what Toufuu had told him.<br/>The doctor had returned to attending his other patients.<p>(Man! This is great!)<p>He was also grinning.<p>(A new move!)<p>Discovered by accident.<p>(So?)<p>This was exactly what he had in mind when he dreamed of the Kijin<br/>Shikaku, all those long days more than a week ago. Just goes to show<br/>how warped some peoples sense of time is.<p>(I can go thru stuff! Wait... or is that have stuff go through me?<br/>Uhh... who cares? A new move!)<p>His joy was barely contained. As it was he looked ready to do a<br/>victory dance even with his  anyone walked into the room<br/>just then and seen him, chances are they would have gotten very<br/>nervous indeed. Ranma was rubbing his hands in glee, with a grinning<br/>face that promised mischief and havoc to Nerima.<p>The young Saotome was looking forward to having some fun with some key<br/>figures in the ward.<p>(Ryouga's gonna pop a vein! Vein? He's gonna go on a rampage!) Image<br/>of a steaming Ryouga attacking him for having dared to come up with<br/>such a cool move appeared. (Man he's gonna go nuts!)<p>(Ohh yeah! The ghoul can't do her shiatsu on me no more! Heh heh heh.<br/>A super cool move that the Amazons don't have. Wonder what she'll do.<br/>Probably demand that I show it to her. Hah! As if I'm gonna do that!)<br/>A picture of him gloating in front of an impotently furious Cologne<br/>popped into his head. (She'll probably have Shampoo try harder ta get<br/>me into the tribe...)<p>Ranma's face lost a bit of glee and enthusiasm.<p>(Shampoo equals Mousse.)<p>(If Shampoo comes, so will Ucch- Ukyou.)<p>The smile lessened.<p>(The tomboy's gonna get jealous again. Heh.)<p>(Nabiki...)<p>His face was in a frown by then.<p>(Kami knows who she'd tell. Money grabbin...) Ranma's thought<br/>degenerated into a few choice curses.<p>(Definitely the Kunos. Kodachi's gonna go nuts when she sees Shampoo<br/>and Ucch- Ukyou there, and Kuno will think I'm a damned sorceror for<br/>real.)<p>The frown continued, then turned into a smirk.<p>(Heh. Let them come. Saotome Ranma's gonna seriously kick some ass!<br/>Yeah!)<p>Another image came into his mind, this time of him standing in an<br/>Oh-So-Cool pose, unscathed as neither rivals nor admirers could touch<br/>him. A second image popped up, with him standing victorious and<br/>laughing before a background of streamers, confetti, orchestras and<br/>victory banners carried by chirping birds, as his bruised rivals<br/>weakly beat the ground, crying in abject failure. Ukyou, Shampoo and<br/>Kodachi crying at the side for failing to even touch him, with Akane<br/>in the dojo working steam off because she couldn't mallet him anymore.<p>Ranma could nearly taste the sweetness of the moment, and his mirth<br/>showed it. (Heh heh heh. I am so gonna kick their asses! Not that I<br/>don't beat up those three everytime...)<p>(Those idiots will try their best though... heh. Man, the house's<br/>gonna be a mess. And they still can't beat m-...)<p>His expression suddenly changed, from gleeful to a slight frown.<p>Scenes from the aftermath of the wedding attempt flashed through his<br/>mind's eye. He recalled vividly how Kasumi diligently worked to clear<br/>the mess, obviously tired to anyone who paid attention, hiding it with<br/>sheer discipline so as to appear cheerful, even then.<p>He saw Tendo-san's face as the older man sighed at the destruction of<br/>his beloved dojo and house.<p>Ranma recalled how guilty his mother's eyes seemed as she saw her host<br/>sigh. She felt guilt and shame because her son was the reason of the<br/>destruction. Soun's kindness should have been repaid in the same, not<br/>in a show of hostility. It did not matter that others had done the<br/>damaging; as guests they were responsible, as the intruders had come<br/>for _them_. Mostly, anyway.<p>He understood how his mother felt, but he also knew Tendo-san's<br/>feelings. The man did not blame the Saotomes in the slightest; he knew<br/>the risks of what he wanted to do and accepted them. The wedding would<br/>have been a success had it not been for the attackers. It might seem<br/>deeper than the pigtailed youth could understand, but like Ranma,<br/>Tendo-san was a martial artist; he understood these things, and lived<br/>by them. They were alike.<p>Besides, it was his daughter who had tipped off the uninvited guests.<p>(Nabiki...)<p>The young Saotome sighed. With a technique that defied physics, Kami<br/>above knew what the girl would do with the information. Even if he<br/>faced Nabiki about it, she would wave aside his complaints. She always<br/>had answers for everything, a dozen reasons ready at hand.<p>(And she does it all like it's nothin'.)<p>Brash and confident as he was, Ranma knew he was outclassed in the<br/>reasoning area. Nabiki was the master there, and how could he ignore<br/>the facts that she shoved into his face? Nevermind that she had to<br/>manipulate half-truths, inveigled people - namely him - or had just<br/>plain lied to do so; it was hard to deny her reasoning. Especially if<br/>one lacked the knowledge and experience.<p>That, and a backbone.<p>He sighed again.<p>(What to do what to do wh-)<p>"Ranma!"<p>The boy turned towards the voice, broken out of his musings.<p>To find that he couldn't breathe.<p>Saotome Nodoka hugged her beloved son tightly, gushing about her<br/>beloved manly son, how she had nearly lost him, and so on, and so<br/>forth.<p>****<p>A more composed Saotome Nodoka sat in a chair by Ranma's bedside. Her<br/>son, no longer asphyxiating, was inspecting the food she had brought.<br/>He did a little sampling as he went through them, of course.<p>"Unagi, ebi tempura, takoyaki.. mom! You brought all my favourites!<br/>Did Doc tell ya I woke up?"<p>"No dear, he did not. I was thinking of waving them under your nose to<br/>get you out of your coma."<p>Ranma gave her an incredulous look. "Mom?"<p>"Well, you are your father's son."<p>His expression changed to one of sheepishness, and he only managed a<br/>weak "Heh heh."<p>"Ranma dear," Nodoka's expression turned slightly serious, "Doctor<br/>Toufuu said you nearly died. What in the name of the Kami happened?"<p>"Uhh... I... was trying out a new technique."<p>"A martial arts technique, Ranma?"<p>He nodded.<p>"Did it work?"<p>He didn't answer, but looked at his hands. He was obviously trying to<br/>find an answer, looking very thoughtful as he twiddled his fingers.<p>Ranma looked up and into his mother's eyes.<p>He would not bring any more destruction to the Tendo Dojo. He will not<br/>have his mother suffer any guilt, not even the slightest.<p>"Naah Mom. It didn't. Went haywire is more like it."<p>His mother nodded in understanding. "I'm sure you'll get it next time,<br/>dear."<p>Ranma offered his mother a wide grin. "Of course I will, Mom. Saotome<br/>Ranma never gives up, and always gets his... err... move. Heh."<p>Nodoka got up from her seat, stepped forward, and hugged him tightly,<br/>though not as crushing as before. "Oh Ranma, you make your mother so<br/>proud. To me you're already a man amongst men, but you're taking it<br/>even further."<p>Ranma slowly returned his mother's embrace, a puzzled expression on<br/>his face.<p>"Uhh... even further? Err... whaddaya mean, Mom?"<p>His mother broke the embrace, and looked straight into his eyes.<p>"You're a superb martial artist, Ranma, and you do it so well because<br/>you truly put your heart into it. Now, you're going to do the same<br/>with your studies, I can only imagine how well you are going to do at<br/>school."<p>Nodoka's eyes had started to look slightly dewy.<p>"At first I thought you were going to focus slightly less on the Art;<br/>study does take up quite a bit of your time, after all. But now I<br/>stand here, I see that you are devoted as ever to our family's Art.<br/>Not even a near death experience deters you."<p>The Saotome matriarch had shed some tears, and she bowed her head so<br/>that her son would not have to see them. She pulled out a handkerchief<br/>and gently dabbed at her tears.<p>"I am sorry to cry and embarrass you, my son, but I'm so proud of you.<br/>All of this... means so very much to me."<p>"Uhh..." the pigtailed boy struggled to find something to offer his<br/>mother, "it... it's okay Mom. I'm not embarrassed or nothin'."<p>Nodoka dabbed at her eyes once again, and looked up, smiling at her<br/>son. "That's 'not embarrassed or anything', dear."<p>"Uhh... right. Mom, if you don't mind me asking, why does it mean so<br/>much to you? Not that I have a problem with it or anythin', ya know...<br/>I'm... ah... curious."<p>Smiling at her quizzical son, she stepped back, and sat on the chair.<br/>"It is every mother's dream that her child be successful, no matter<br/>what he or she does. In your case Ranma, you have done me proud by<br/>excelling at your Art. However, your pursuit of the Art has made you<br/>neglect your studies. Now, you seek to correct that. I was so happy<br/>when you made that dinner announcement on Saturday. To have one's son<br/>excel in one field, is one thing, Ranma. To have him succeed in two<br/>opposing areas..." Nodoka didn't finish her sentence, but merely<br/>smiled proudly at her son.<p>Ranma was starting to blush a little; he had never been praised this<br/>much before. To have his mother say all that had been said... He did<br/>his best not to choke on his words.<p>"Mom, if it meant so much to you that I do well in my studies, why<br/>didn't you say anything earlier?"<p>Her shoulders sagged slightly, as her eyes turned a trifle sad. "I<br/>could have, couldn't I?"<p>Ranma nodded.<p>"And you would have done as I had asked, wouldn't you, dear?"<p>"Yeah, Mom. You only had to ask."<p>Nodoka sighed softly, nearly inaudibly.<p>"Shortly after your fifth birthday, your father took you on that<br/>training journey. I tried to stop him, but he convinced me that it<br/>would be for the best. Although you are now cursed to turn female with<br/>cold water, it has only made you far stronger. If anything, you are<br/>more manly _because_ of the curse. From what I have seen so far, you<br/>try harder to prove yourself. The trials and tribulations you have<br/>gone through are fit for the lifetimes of five people, Ranma, not one.<br/>You struggle to be the best, no matter how demanding the situation<br/>is."<p>Pride flooded his chest, though he did not look it; his mother's<br/>acknowledgement, in so many words, had made so much of his pain<br/>worthwhile.<p>Nodoka continued, "Therein lies the problem, Ranma. For ten years,<br/>your father had demanded so much from you. He had to have demanded so<br/>much, else you would not be this good, this young."<p>Ranma nodded his assent.<p>"Your training demands your utmost concentration. Your rivals demand<br/>that you fight your hardest, demand that you lose and prove their<br/>superiority. Your suitors demand your attention, your love, that you<br/>return what they feel for you. The Amazon matriarch demands that you<br/>bow to their laws and return to their lands. Master Happousai demands<br/>that you show him respect, though it is more to let him have his<br/>errant ways with the town. Tendo-san demands that you marry one of his<br/>daughters and join our families, for the sake of honour."<p>By then Nodoka was looking at her hands, which were on her lap.<p>"Even- Even I demanded so much of you," she said, nearly whispering.<br/>"That contract."<p>"Mom-"<p>Nodoka shushed him, cutting off her son's protest. "It is the truth,<br/>dear."<p>Ranma had nothing to say to that.<p>"I asked Kasumi, about how you first knew of me. She told me that<br/>until a few months ago, you did not even know that you had a mother,<br/>Ranma." Nodoka sounded as if she was going to cry again.<p>"Uhh... Mom... I-"<p>His mother silenced him with a small gesture.<p>"It is not your fault, dear. What I'm trying to say is, is that I have<br/>been absent from you life for so long, that I feel that I have no<br/>place in your life anymore. I didn't know anything about you. Not what<br/>you're like, not what your favourite food is, not even what you look<br/>like..."<p>Another soft sob escaped her. "Even the people who shout for your<br/>death know you more than I did. _They_ had more to do with you than I.<br/>It was as if I had all but abandoned my one and only child. I<br/>certainly have no right to _demand_ anything from you, Ranma. It is a<br/>mother's right to ask a of her flesh and blood, but right now it feels<br/>so wrong."<p>"I didn't feel it before, but I do, now, " Nodoka said under her<br/>breath, as if to herself.<p>Ranma could only stare at his mother, who was evidently trying to hold<br/>back the tears, and failing. Her shoulders shook, and the sight broke<br/>her son's heart.<p>The youth was at a loss. Nothing in his training had prepared him for<br/>this. Racking his brains, he finally got off the bed, went to his<br/>mother's side, and hugged her close. Nodoka hugged him in return,<br/>still crying silently.<p>"Uhh... don't cry Mom. Errmm... uhh... it's not your fault either, ya<br/>know? We all hadta do what we hadta do... uhh..."<p>Internally, Ranma beat his head, trying to find something appropriate<br/>to say to his mother.<p>"Errmm... what's passed, is in the past... now that you're here...<br/>you're... as much of my life as Pops, ya know? Maybe even more... I<br/>know you take better care of me than he does. Uhh... you're the best<br/>Mom a guy could ever have," he said, still hugging his mother.<p>"Besides, you don't hafta demand anythin', ya know. You're my Mom,<br/>always have been, always will be. All you ever hafta do is ask."<p>The only reply he got was the tightening of his mother's embrace. It<br/>did not crush him, but told him that what he had said was what his<br/>mother had dearly needed to hear.<p>****<br/>-A little later-<p>Ranma was gobbling down the food that his mother had brought.<p>Nodoka was sipping her tea, poured from her flask. "Ranma dear, that<br/>food isn't going anywhere. Why don't you slow down? It will taste<br/>better that way."<p>He promptly acquiesced, and the slight blur in front of him solidified<br/>in mid-air into a hand bearing a pair of chopsticks, slowly delivering<br/>a payload of cured weiner octupus.<p>"Mmm mmm... these are great Mom."<p>"I'll be sure to tell Kasumi you said that. She made that one."<p>"Kasumi made this? Mmm... now there's a Tendo that can really cook."<p>Nodoka glanced at Ranma slyly, who was about to swallow a prawn. "Oh?<br/>What about Akane?"<p>"Haack!" Ranma hacked and coughed and sputtered immediately, as the<br/>memory of the sight and chi-taste of the squid flashed back to him. It<br/>lasted for half a minute, before he finally caught himself.<p>"Uhh... sorry 'bout that Mom. Anyway, I said 'now there's a Tendo that<br/>can REALLY cook.'"<p>"Really, dear? As I recall, someone had dove - nearly literally -<br/>into a bowl of curry last Saturday evening. In fact, I had never seen<br/>him devour Kasumi's curry quite like that. I assure you, Kasumi did<br/>not even touch a speck of curry powder on that day."<p>"Uhh... ahhh... well..."<p>Nodoka looked at her son slyly as he tried to counter her words. "I<br/>think his words were, and I quote, 'This curry is great!'" she<br/>mimicked, deepening her voice a little to complete the effect.<p>"That... was... umm... I mean..."<p>"He hardly said anything to his mother during dinner. He merely<br/>grunted, as he shovelled the curry into his mouth. Tsk tsk. Can you<br/>imagine that?" asked Nodoka. She smugly sipped her tea.<p>Her son threw up his hands. "All right! She cooks a real mean curry!"<p>"'A real mean curry', Ranma? Is that all?"<p>The pigtailed boy spared her a momentary look of utter hopelessness.<br/>He drew in a breath and said, "It was the best curry I've ever had."<p>His shoulders then slumped and he sighed exaggeratedly, as if he had<br/>just been relieved of a great burden.<p>"_Really_?" Nodoka squaled. "Ooh, wait 'till Akane-chan hears this!"<p>"Huh? Ahh- Uhh... emm.. Moooommm!" the poor boy was quite red.<p>"Now, now, Ranma," soothed his mother, patting his hand. "You simply<br/>_must_ learn to give praise accordingly. You will have more allies<br/>that way."<p>"Tell me about it," grumbled the boy, as he remembered how he had told<br/>someone that 'she was cute' all those months ago.<p>"_Deserving_ praise, Ranma. Flattering someone to get out of trouble<br/>will almost always backfire, I assure you."<p>"Uhh..." Great. His mother was psychic. "Umm... I'll keep that in<br/>mind, Mom."<p>"I'm sure you will, dear," said Nodoka. "Or do you actually want a new<br/>fiancée?"<p>Immediately Ranma went into another hacking/coughing session, this one<br/>lasting for about a full minute. He struggled to get his breath, and<br/>turned to his mother.<p>"Moommm!"<p>Nodoka broke into peals of laughter. It was a few moments before she<br/>managed to compose herself. "Oh I'm sorry dear, but you looked so<br/>adorable."<p>"Huh?" Ranma didn't know what else to say. "Umm... if you say so, Mom.<br/>And no, I ain't lookin' for a new fiancée. Ucch- Ukyou by herself is<br/>one too many."<p>"Oh?" quizzed Nodoka, "I thought you called her 'Ucchan', Ranma dear?<br/>That's what you call your best friend, don't you?"<p>The boy heaved a sigh. "Best friends don't crash your wedding, Mom."<p>Nodoka was inscrutable. "I see. Did you want to get married, then?"<p>"It's not about getting married, Mom. It's about letting me live my<br/>life. It's about respecting my decisions. Nobody actually listens to<br/>what I actually want to do!"<p>It was Nodoka's turn to sigh, although very softly. "Including me."<p>"I didn't say that!" Ranma nearly shouted.<p>"But it's true, isn't it?" his mother said softly.<p>"No-"<p>Nodoka's soft hand on his cut off his denial.<p>"It is time we faced the truth, dear."<p>Ranma could only nod dumbly.<p>"What about Akane?"<p>"Huh? What about the tomboy?"<p>"Does she listen to what you want to say or do?"<p>"Uh... well... she keeps shovin' that sludge she calls her cookin' in<br/>my face all the time..." his sentence trailed off as Nodoka gave him a<br/>very stern look.<p>(Sheesh... Forgot that ya avoided lookin' me in the eyes when she<br/>shoved that squid in my face, eh Mom?)<p>"Heh... umm... the tomboy? She... uhh... doesn't twist my arm or<br/>nothin'... not even... uhh... at the wedding. She doesn't listen to my<br/>side of the story much," Nodoka raised an eyebrow at that, unnoticed<br/>by her son, "but she... uh... never tried ta make me do stuff I really<br/>don't wanna."<p>('Cept make me eat her cooking...)<p>"I see. Does Ukyou... twist your arm, Ranma? Borrowing your<br/>expression, that is."<p>"Umm... Sometimes."<p>"Hence your being upset with her."<p>Ranma nodded. "Yeah, I guess... and..."<p>"Oh?" Nodoka was intrigued. "Would you share it with me, dear?"<p>Pausing, he said, "Not that I wanted ta get married or nothin',<br/>but..."<p>"Go on."<p>"It was a special day, ya know? For a girl... uh... for..."<p>"You're upset because Ukyou ruined Akane's special day, Ranma?"<p>"Not that I give a hoot 'bout the tomboy or nothin'... heh. It's just<br/>that there are some things ya don't do, if you get my drift. I...<br/>still consider Ucchan a friend, but..."<p>His mother looked at him inscrutably, silent for a few moments, which<br/>he spent getting his breath back. The conversation was exhausting.<p>"It seems to me, Ranma, that you're upset with Ukyou, but not too<br/>upset. However, you're still treating her like you're really upset<br/>because you don't know what else to do."<p>"I'm treating her like I'm really upset 'cuz I'm really upset!"<p>Nodoka stared at her son, taken aback by Ranma's sudden outburst.<p>"Ucchan's the last person I expected to do what she did, Mom! She's my<br/>best friend! She should've asked me what I wanted! Not like I know<br/>what the hell- uh... heck I want, but it was the right thing to do!<br/>It's what friends do!"<p>Ranma broke off his tirade and looked at his mom a bit nervously.<br/>"That's what friends do, right?"<p>Nodoka fought off a giggle. "Yes, dear. That is what a friend would<br/>do."<p>"And she crashed the place!" he abruptly continued, vindicated. "No<br/>questions, no nothing! She just walked in and threw bombs! Like she<br/>wasn't even my friend!"<p>"You know what makes it worse, Mom? It's not really her fault! I can't<br/>really blame her for what she did, as much as I want to. I'm mad at<br/>her, but I'm not! Her fiancé was about to get hitched to someone else,<br/>for Kami's sake! I mean, what else could she have done?"<p>Nodoka nodded, "Thus she came in like a jilted lover."<p>"But we're not lovers! For ten years I thought that she was a guy!<br/>From the moment we met! Almost like a brother!" He paused. "Who wants<br/>to marry me... some brother, huh?"<p>Ranma looked at his mother, eyes slightly drooped. "I should be angry,<br/>and I am. I shouldn't be angry, and I'm not."<p>"Angry? With whom, dear?" his mother prodded.<p>"With Ucchan. Shampoo. Heck, even Pops."<p>The youth sighed again, looking very tired. "I don't know what to do,<br/>Mom. I really don't. Everybody knows it, and everybody thinks I should<br/>do things their way." He gazed into the ceiling, eyes unfocused.<br/>"Everybody."<p>"Everybody, dear?"<p>"Everybody but the tomboy," the boy replied softly, the effort of the<br/>conversation finally taking its toll on his convalescing body. "Maybe<br/>that's why I like her more than everyone else."<p>Her eyes widened. Had Ranma just said what she thought he just said?<p>"But I can't show that I like her... 'cuz I don't know what I'm really<br/>feeling. And 'cuz I don't know what I want. I don't know even know<br/>what to do with her... even if she's the one I really-" Ranma yawned,<br/>and continued in a lower voice, fatigue settling deeper, "- that I<br/>really want."<p>Nodoka merely looked at her son, wondering if Ranma fully realized<br/>what he was saying. She doubted it; he looked more asleep than awake.<p>"I don't want to hurt her. Not her."<p>"At least I know..." Ranma yawned again, "I love my Mom."<p>With that, Ranma fell into a deep slumber, leaving Nodoka to stare at<br/>him with dewy eyes. Then her tears flowed. Her son was confused,<br/>angry, sad, frustrated, all at once. So young, yet so burdened, and<br/>there was nothing she could do. The threads in play ran longer than<br/>the Saotome's loom.<p>Nodoka settled to watch over her sleeping child. She would pray that<br/>he found peace in his sleep, at least.<p>**********<br/>-Furinkan High, Friday-<p>"Saotome!"<p>Kuno Tatewaki, captain of the Furinkan High Kendo team, stood<br/>imperiously upon the path between the school gates and doors. He was,<br/>as usual, the very embodiment of righteous fury against The Foul Magus<br/>Saotome.<p>"Hmm? Oh... morning, moron."<p>Saotome Ranma, resident living embodiment of Chaos and unofficial<br/>patron god of Martial Arts of Furinkan, plodded morosely upon said<br/>path. He was, at the moment, the very picture of one who is not bright<br/>and chipper.<p>"Insolent cur! You shouwpubbth-"<p>It was hard to vocalize one's thoughts through a mouthful of dirt and<br/>grass, laced with a touch of unconsciousness, as Kuno then found out.<p>Again.<p>"Shithead," muttered the young Saotome, lowering his arm from the<br/>single uppercut to Kuno's solar plexus. Though nearly inaudible, the<br/>phrase was somehow carried by a slight breeze, that all on the path<br/>heard it. All of a sudden there was an glaring absence of students on<br/>the paved footway between Ranma and the school entrance.<p>A slightly irritated Ranma was quite frequently seen.<p>One showing even a semblance of a temper was not. The prudent students<br/>of Furinkan High had acted accordingly.<p>Ranma continued walking down the path, oblivious to his unintentional<br/>monoply. Akane walked quietly alongside him, just behind his right<br/>shoulder. She waved to some of her friends, mouthing "good morning" as<br/>she did so, and continued walking with her fiancé, looking slightly<br/>concerned. Like the rest of the observing students, she was wondering<br/>what was bothering Ranma.<p>The reason for Ranma's extreme irritation was quite simple really,<br/>although for a normal person it would sound quite... strange.<p>Starting that day, Saotome Ranma had to do well in school.<p>No more sleeping in class.<p>No more automatic backhands against flying board erasers in his sleep.<p>No more ignoring the teacher in favour of sitting crosslegged on his<br/>chair while eating a bento, ill-hidden by a book spread wide and made<br/>to stand.<p>No more skipping classes with Hiroshi and Daisuke to go to the arcade<br/>or their cafe haunts.<p>(My life sucks.)<p>Having to listen to Hinako's lectures.<p>(My life really sucks.)<p>Having to stay awake through History.<p>(Kami-sama my life really sucks.)<p>And Mathematics.<p>(Shit.)<p>Get the best grades he possibly could in all his subjects.<p>*Sigh*<p>Standing before the door of his classroom, he took a deep breath.<p>(Suck it up and take it like a man, Saotome. What would Pops say if he<br/>saw you like this?)<p>His mood improved slightly, but was laced with irritation at his panda<br/>father. Ranma didn't feel like starting the school day with thoughts<br/>of his old man.<p>(Do it for Mom. Do it for Mom. Do it for Mom. Do it...)<p>Repeating the mantra to himself, he stepped into classroom 2-F.<p>****<p>"Good morning everyone!"<p>Ninomiya Hinako bounced into the classroom, carrying her books, a<br/>lollipop in her mouth.<p>Ranma merely grumbled.<p>"Mister Saotome, you're back!" exclaimed the teacher, her cute smile<br/>widening as she bounced over to his desk.<p>"Yeah, yeah," the boy replied.<p>Hinako beamed at his reply, seemingly uncaring of her student's<br/>grumpy, nearly rude attitude. She was just glad to have him back.<br/>Furinkan just wasn't the same without her most problematic student. He<br/>was, after all, the reason for her transfer to Furinkan. His sullen<br/>demeanour was a sure sign that he was being his usual delinquent self.<p>Finally, things were getting back to normal.<p>Still smiling warmly at Ranma, the juvenile teacher gave a small,<br/>contented sigh; it felt so good to be on familiar grounds again.<p>"Uhh..."<p>Ranma was starting to fidget. His teacher was still giving him that<br/>warm smile. Smiles are fine. He didn't mind smiles.<p>A warm smile with a slightly lingering gaze, however, spelled definite<br/>trouble. It didn't matter if the smile was platonic, Trouble would<br/>just invite itself in if the smile persisted.<p>"Sensei..."<p>"Hmm?" replied the teacher, still half immersed in reverie.<p>"Sensei!"<p>The shout finally brought Hinako back into the classroom. "Yes, Miss<br/>Tendo?"<p>Maintaining a look that would have withered lesser women, Akane<br/>replied, "Roll call."<p>"Hmm? Oh!" Hinako bounded over to the teachers table, and opened the<br/>class register. With the lollipop still dangling from her mouth, she<br/>went through the list.<p>****<p>"Darn..." muttered Hinako as the chalk she was holding broke on the<br/>last character she was writing. She rubbed on the extended stroke with<br/>a finger, placed a period, and turned to face her students.<p>"Now, who can give me the translation for... for... Mister Saotome!"<p>"Huh?" said the boy, clearly bewildered. He had been trying to<br/>translate 'Hideki bought himself a can of cold coffee.' English was so<br/>damn hard.<p>"What are you doing?" By then the dimunitive teacher was standing in<br/>front of his desk, arms akimbo.<p>"Huh?" was all Ranma could manage, "I'm doing what you told the class<br/>ta do, what's it look like?"<p>Hinako immediately took a reflexive step backwards. "You..." Ranma had<br/>to strain to hear what she was saying.<p>With a look of near horror, she exclaimed "You're paying attention!"<p>That did it. More than twenty heads snapped around to look at Ranma,<br/>who was wide awake, not eating, and had a _pencil_ in his hand.<p>The classroom was suddenly very, very quiet.<p>"Well, D~UH!" Ranma answered irritably. He had heard someone use that<br/>last word a few weeks ago, and it suited the moment perfectly, he<br/>thought.<p>A small, faint squeaking and scratching sound came, followed by<br/>another, another, another, and another. Within ten seconds, the class<br/>again fell into a pocket of silence.<p>By then Ranma had his own constituency within the classroom. The desks<br/>around his, save Akane's, were at least four feet away from his.<p>One of the students shivered. He had left his good luck charm in his<br/>locker. How was he to know Saotome was going to pull a weird one? The<br/>guy looked normal today! Sure, he had looked kinda grumpy in the<br/>morning, but he put Kuno out like a light! He hadn't done that for<br/>weeks! Practically everybody had big goofy grins when Ranma had<br/>disappeared past the school doors! Violence had returned to Furinkan!<br/>Chaos! Mass destruction! _Everybody_ agreed life would be normal<br/>again! Even the teachers! It made sense to leave the charms!<p>Now _this_. It was all the boy could do to stop from gibbering. The<br/>sentiment was particularly common in the classroom at the moment.<p>Ranma was, understandably irritated. "What the _hell_ is wrong with ya<br/>people?"<p>After taking a few moments to compose herself, Hinako finally crossed<br/>her arms and said, "Care to explain yourself, Mister Saotome?"<p>"What?" Ranma shot up from his seat, wearing an expression that said<br/>'You hafta be shittin' me.'<p>"You hafta be shittin' me!"<p>Normally, he wouldn't have used that kind of language on a teacher,<br/>but the day was really getting to him.<p>"This is a school! I'm here to learn somethin'! _You_ are supposed to<br/>teach me! You were teaching! I was learning! What's there to<br/>explain?"<p>Hinako had taken another step backwards, one of her arms held out in<br/>front of her, bent at the elbow, as if to shield herself. Her face<br/>held a look of utter disbelief.<p>"That can't be!" she exclaimed. Hinako told herself that she had heard<br/>him wrong. Ranma had fought her every attempt to educate him tooth<br/>and nail. One morning he just shows up ready to be taught? It couldn't<br/>be. Her world as she knew it was not dangerously wrong. She was safe,<br/>she had to be! Ranma _must_ be kidding with her!<p>"Mister Saotome," she said in a slightly quivering voice, "you're<br/>making a joke, right?"<p>Her voice came out soft, nearly pleading.<p>Heaving a big, heavy sigh, Ranma lifted the book he was writing on,<br/>and showed a partly completed sentence. "I was trying to translate the<br/>sentence you wrote on the board, sensei."<p>The young teacher didn't even see the book he was showing her. She was<br/>looking straight into his eyes, her face showing the struggle within.<br/>The struggle to rationalize the irrational, to understand the<br/>incomprehensible. Finally, she reached a conclusion.<p>"You're up to something!" she exclaimed, pointing a finger at Ranma.<p>"_WHAT_?"<p>Ranma's expression now read as 'Are you out of your freakin' mind?'<p>"Are you out of your freakin' mind?" he wasn't being particularly<br/>choosy of his words at the moment, and Hinako didn't even seem to<br/>notice. Ranma turned to look at his classmates.<p>To see them nod in agreement with Hinako.<p>The young Saotome fell to his seat, leaned back, and slapped his<br/>forehead. Putting his hand down, he looked at his classmates again.<br/>"You people don't believe I'm studying, just like you?"<p>All around, heads shook. Some slowly, others Soun-like - near<br/>epileptic. Hinako was among the slower ones.<p>Again, Ranma sighed. This couldn't be happening to him. All he wanted<br/>to do was study and make his mother proud of him. Now this.<p>He turned to look at Akane, hoping she could suggest something.<p>Akane shrugged, looking unsure of the situation.<p>Sighing for the umpteenth time, Ranma turned to Hinako. Maybe some<br/>sarcasm would work; anything, and that meant _anything_, was better<br/>than this, he was _sure_ of it.<p>"Fine. I'm JUST pretending to study. I'm using it as a cover for my<br/>real plans. I'm actually ogling you, Hinako-sensei. I'm using my every<br/>waking moment to have a really good look at your body, in both forms."<p>By then, Hinako was covering her mouth daintily, wearing an<br/>inscrutable expression. Finally, she said, "Really?"<p>"NO!" Ranma shot out of his seat, "I'm here to study! Didn't you hear<br/>me earlier?"<p>It was no use. Hinako was lost in the recesses of her mind,<br/>contemplating Ranma's 'secret plan.' The class was abuzz with talk of<br/>the latest development.<p>"It makes sense, you know. He was practically staring at her!"<p>"Wow, who knew? All this while he pretended to fight Hinako-sensei,<br/>but he actually has the hots for her!"<p>"I _told_ you so! Remember how he used to grab Hinako-sensei's<br/>breasts? He said it was a technique!" A giggle was heard. "That's some<br/>technique! I'll bet he's hooked on the sensei!"<p>"I wouldn't blame him; Hinako's damn hot!"<p>"You think Hinako-sensei's hooked on him too?"<p>"Say... now _there's_ a thought!"<p>It crossed Ranma's mind that maybe, just maybe, this sarcasm thing<br/>wasn't much better.<p>"It all makes sense! Akane's always calling him a pervert! The poor<br/>guy's just being himself!"<p>"Hey! You're right!"<p>"I think you just hit the jackpot, man!"<p>Ranma could only look and listen to all of it, completely slackjawed.<br/>A few more minutes passed that way, until his brain finally resumed<br/>control of his jaw.<p>"OI!"<p>Everybody clammed up and turned to look at him.<p>"Are you people _NUTS_?" the poor boy was very nearly tearing his hair<br/>out.<p>The response to his question was... disconcerting. One by one, a look<br/>of smiling approval was directed his way by his classmates. A common<br/>thought ran through many, many minds.<p>*The poor guy's just being himself.*<p>"Arrrghhhh!" Poor Ranma couldn't take it anymore. He turned to Akane<br/>for help.<p>He found none. Apparently Akane's system had locked up during his<br/>'admission to a secret plan.' The girl sat unmoving, looking at him<br/>with vacant, shocked eyes.<p>(Oh shit.) His one hope for support was catatonic.<p>Desperate, he turned to face Hinako.<p>"Sensei?" his voice was nearly pleading.<p>Hinako was still staring at him with that inscrutable look.<p>"Sensei?" Ranma's voice rose a little.<p>It worked. Slowly, Hinako lowered her hand from her mouth, and smiled<br/>shyly at him.<p>"You should have said so earlier, Ranma-kun. You gave me quite a<br/>fright."<p>"Wha-...?" Ranma couldn't believe what he was hearing.<p>"You have my permission to... continue with your plan, Ranma-kun,"<br/>said Hinako, as she smartly turned around and walked to the front of<br/>the class. There, she picked up her book, and started to continue<br/>teaching.<p>Suddenly a thought struck her, and she moved towards the door, and<br/>stepped out. Two moments later, she stepped back in.<p>Correction. Adult Hinako stepped back in. Her clothes stretched, this<br/>way and that, and it bulged here, curved there.<p>"Better, Ranma-kun?" she asked, smiling shyly at him.<p>Saotome Ranma could only bang his head on his desk, again, and again,<br/>and again, and...<p>**********<p>"Tadaima," called out a tired, flat voice.<p>Stepping out of a doorway, Nodoka saw her son trudge into the house<br/>proper from the foyer. He was looking very sullen, and his shoulders<br/>drooped.<p>"Oh dear," she murmured as she hurried to his side. Nodoka gave her<br/>son a once over, and found not even a scratch. "What's wrong, Ranma<br/>dear? Where's Akane?"<p>Ranma continued to walk, straight into the kitchen, and dropped<br/>himself into a chair. Nodoka moved to the stove to make him some tea.<p>"Rough day at school, Mom."<p>In his opinion, 'rough' hardly cut it. First, the big, idiotic<br/>production in Hinako's class. He had managed to stop himself from<br/>banging his head on his desk after five minutes, and did his best to<br/>concentrate on studying. Although he had to work hard at ignoring<br/>Hinako's shy smiles, he did manage to learn _something_.<p>Then, came math. Though the teacher didn't make a fuss like Hinako<br/>did, the other students noticed that he had been paying attention to<br/>_that_ teacher too! Sure, the teacher was female, but was in her late<br/>thirties and had had a child. Wild speculations were flung back and<br/>forth throughout the class.<p>Math was followed by History, taught by Fujishima-sensei, a forty-five<br/>year old man with a balding pate, thick glasses and a paunch, all at a<br/>not so impressive five foot two. Still, Ranma paid attention.<p>Understandably, lunch was a veritable explosion of gossiping and<br/>rumour-mongering. The news - and all its colourful variants - spread<br/>like wildfire throughout the school. Those who were still commenting<br/>on Kuno's rapid defeat that morning found more juicy stories about the<br/>school's favourite martial artist and source for entertainment and<br/>gossip - Ranma.<p>Ranma had the hots for Hinako.<p>Hinako also had the hots for Ranma.<p>Ranma had the hots for the math teacher.<p>Ranma had the hots for Fujishima-sensei. Nearly the whole school gave<br/>disgusted looks at that thought. No, Ranma doesn't have the hots for<br/>Fujishima; it didn't make sense. Then...<p>Ranma _must_ have _another_ ultra secret plan! That thing about ogling<br/>Hinako was just a ruse!<p>It couldn't be _just_ a ruse! Hinako actually transformed for Ranma!<br/>And she was so shy in front of him! It had to be true! _That_ got a<br/>lot of heads nodding.<p>Then... that ogling thing must be only part of a bigger, more cunning<br/>plan! More had nodded to that.<p>But what could the plan be? From there, it all went downhill, as<br/>dozens and dozens of theories, speculations and stabs in the dark were<br/>made.<p>For once, Nabiki did not make a single yen out of such a juicy topic.<br/>How could she, when she hadn't been privy to the details? That<br/>infuriated her no end, and was the only thing Ranma could name as a<br/>'good thing that happened today'. Anything that ticked off the middle<br/>Tendo was a good thing, in Ranma's books.<p>Nodoka poured Ranma a mug of tea, and sat in front of him. "My, they<br/>must be pushing students very hard at school these days. Dear, where's<br/>Akane?"<p>Ranma took a sip of his tea, placed the mug on the table, and then his<br/>face next to it. He sighed heavily, and said "She's with her friends.<br/>She's not talking to me."<p>"Oh? And why is that, dear?"<p>"She-" he halted, and sighed again. "Rumours at school. People are<br/>saying that I have a crush on one of the teachers, and that she has a<br/>crush on me, and blah blah blah..."<p>"Oh my," was all Nodoka could say.<p>"Whatta buncha goofballs..." muttered Ranma, before he sighed again.<br/>He had never thought he would see what he had seen that day, when<br/>everybody in his school collectively made less sense than Kodachi.<p>"Ranma, dear?" said Nodoka softly.<p>Still with his head on the table, he answered, "Yeah, Mom?"<p>"Is- Are the rumours true?" asked Nodoka seriously.<p>"What? NO!" Ranma was suddenly sitting up ramrod straight, looking at<br/>his mother in the eyes.<p>"Now, now, Ranma. Don't get angry at me," soothed Nodoka, patting his<br/>hand. "I was just asking, and I believe you," she said, smiling gently<br/>at her son.<p>Ranma sighed again. He had been doing that a lot, lately. "Sorry, Mom.<br/>It was crazy at school." He rested his head on the table again. Nodoka<br/>gently reached out, and stroked his hair. Detecting no complaint from<br/>her child, Nodoka continued to run her fingers through his hair, like<br/>she had done when he was much younger and was but an innocent baby on<br/>her lap.<p>"I can only imagine, dear."<p>Ranma gave a small nod. "The bad thing is, it's not over. Sure, it's<br/>already the weekend, but Nabiki's gonna be home soon, and she's been<br/>lookin' for me all day. Bet she's pissed. I've been makin' myself<br/>scarce the whole day, and she couldn't make a yen. Heh."<p>Ranma gave a small smile. It was a small victory, but it bugged<br/>Nabiki, and that was good.<p>"I see. Are you expecting... retribution, dear?"<p>"If you mean is she gonna get back at me, yeah. You bet," answered the<br/>boy tiredly. "Man, this sucks. This weekend is gonna suck _bad_. What<br/>really sucks is that I haven't done anythin'!"<p>Nodoka remained silent for a while. "Ranma, why don't you get out your<br/>backpack?"<p>That got his attention, and he sat up. "Mom?"<p>His mother was smiling serenely, as usual. "As I remember, dear, you<br/>still have that technique to practice."<p>Ranma's brow furrowed. "Technique? Which technique, Mom?"<p>"The one you told me about at the clinic, dear," she answered. "You're<br/>the heir to our family's Art. It would hardly do for you to be<br/>distracted while you're trying to master a technique, would it now,<br/>dear?"<p>Realization finally dawned on Ranma, and his face showed it. "A<br/>weekend training trip?" he asked, grinning.<p>"To a place of your choice, by yourself. Now, you best get your things<br/>together, and hurry. I'll explain to the others later. Oh! And take<br/>your books along, won't you, Ranma?"<p>Nodding once to his mother, Ranma zipped to the guest room, where<br/>Genma and Nodoka stayed, to get his backpack. Then he rushed to the<br/>dojo, where he now slept, to get his clothes and stuff. He'd get his<br/>own room in a few months, when the Saotome house had been repaired.<br/>For the time being, the dojo was his room. Not that he minded.<p>Less than five minutes after disappearing from the kitchen, Nodoka met<br/>Ranma at the engawa. "I haven't had time to prepare you anything dear.<br/>Here's some money for food."<p>Pocketing the money, Ranma then hugged his mother. "Thanks Mom."<p>She returned his hug, and then broke away. "Keep in mind, Ranma, that<br/>I'm not teaching you to run away from your problems. Always do your<br/>best to face your problems directly. However, when things are not your<br/>fault, you may give yourself the freedom of choice."<p>Her son nodded. "You better get going, Ranma dear. Just don't forget<br/>to come back now," she added teasingly.<p>"Don't worry, Mom," said Ranma. "School on Monday. How can I forget?"<p>Nodoka smiled approvingly as he put on his shoes. As he moved for the<br/>door, Nodoka called out, "Dear, maybe it would best if you didn't make<br/>yourself too visible, hmm?"<p>Ranma threw his mother a grin. "Gotcha, Mom."<p>With that, he sneaked out the door, then over the rear gate.<p>**********<p>Nature is truly beauteous.<p>An example of her beauty was currently inching forward quietly on<br/>soft, black paws. Its furry padded feet made hardly any noise, as the<br/>fox sneaked silently, eyes set on the rabbit five meters away. Its<br/>whiskers twitched as it took another quiet step forward; the fox was<br/>agitated, for it had been two days since it last ate. Starved as it<br/>was, the animal resisted the urge to sprint towards its prey right<br/>away. The rabbit was a matured adult, wary and ever watchful; the game<br/>had to be Sneak, Sprint, Surprise.<p>Now at the very edge of the clearing, the fox coiled itself, preparing<br/>for the dash. It could practically taste the rabbit in its maw.<p>Sprinting in T minus three.<p>Two.<p>O-<p>"DAMN IT TO HELL!"<p>Frayed nerves, splashed with a shot of shock, sent the fox two feet<br/>into the air, very nearly out of his skin. Head whipping side to side,<br/>it searched for the source of its shock, only to hear the sounds of<br/>fluttering wings and scurrying feet as avians and mammals bolted.<p>Mammals?<p>The fox turned to look at where the rabbit was. 'Was' being the<br/>operative word.<p>It was quite a sight, to see the poor fox pull a Soun.<p>****<p>"Damn it to hell baka move!"<p>Ranma was upset.<p>"Damned pig-faced FU*KING PISSING bakayarou move!"<p>Scratch that. He was very upset.<p>There he was, in a light forest just outside a small town on the very<br/>fringe of the humongous sprawl collectively known as Tokyo. It was one<br/>of the many places that he had camped at during his training trip with<br/>Genma. He had arrived the night before, with the intent of perfecting<br/>his new skills.<p>The sun was already three quarters past its apex and he had achieved<br/>not even glorified, bilious chi farts.<p>"Da-"<p>A sudden flash of lightning from the clear sky cut him off, and the<br/>ominous, rumbling thunder - which, oddly enough, seemed to warn him of<br/>his language - a second later convinced him to drop the matter.<p>With a sigh, he dropped himself onto his rear, then onto his back,<br/>arms spread out.<p>(Stupid technique.)<p>It had seemed like the simplest thing. Concentrate, gather chi and<br/>focus it in the abdomen, then channel the chi and will the it to form<br/>into either one of the constructs he had seen. Not that he could see<br/>the constructs anymore, but each fold, twist and stretch _felt_<br/>unique, and he remembered the sequences by heart.<p>Nothing.<p>He had lost count of how many variations to the technique he had<br/>tried, hoping to get some kind of reaction. The young Saotome had<br/>tried emotions, pure will, stances - once even pretending that he<br/>didn't really care if he got the technique or not, then attempting it<br/>_surreptitiously_.<p>Boy, did he feel like Elmer Fudd trying to sneak up on Bugs Bunny with<br/>that one.<p>(What the hell am I doing wrong?)<p>He continued to wonder, as he stared into the sky, absently tracing<br/>the outline of the occasional cloud. A gentle breeze wafted by,<br/>cooling his sweat-slickened skin. The pleasant chill calmed him<br/>somewhat, and eased his frustration over his failure to master a<br/>technique after eleven hours of trying. It was a feeling known to<br/>martial arts masters around the world; true, they felt it after years<br/>of trying - not hours, but Saotome Ranma had standards to keep.<p>Ranma felt another breeze, gentle and cooling, and he closed his eyes<br/>to savour the moment as he felt himself soothed. It had been quite a<br/>while since he had felt that calm, what with the engagements,<br/>challengers, teachers from hell, near death experiences.<p>(Maybe I should've run away from Pop and stayed on my own. Stay here<br/>in the woods.)<p>(Yup, right after Jusenkyou.)<p>Suddenly a loud rumble reached his ears. His eyes snapped open, for a<br/>moment searching the sky for storm clouds, when he realized that it<br/>was his empty stomach that made the sound.<p>It was a good thing, he realized, that he didn't run away after<br/>Jusenkyou. If he had, he would never have tasted Kasumi's cooking, a<br/>great loss by any standard.<p>(Kasumi...)<p>He had never told anyone, but he was in awe of the eldest of the Tendo<br/>sisters. She kept calm and cheerful - honestly so - come what may:<br/>monsters, Amazons, onis, trolls, ghosts. The only time he thought he<br/>saw a forced smile on Kasumi was after the near-wedding, while<br/>cleaning up the mess.<p>The near-wedding.<p>Akane.<p>It seemed nearly bizarre, that Akane was related to Kasumi. The two<br/>were so... different. Worlds apart even. The two shared a similarity,<br/>however - they both had warm, beautiful smiles. When Akane wasn't<br/>angry, that was.<p>Brilliant smiles that warmed the heart, calming frayed nerves and<br/>apprehension. The kind one would want to see when coming home after a<br/>long, hard day. A smile that -<p>The clearing was suddenly filled with the sound of flesh striking<br/>flesh rapidly, repeatedly.<p>(Baka,) thought Ranma. His cheeks and palms stung, but he'd stopped<br/>_that_ train of thought.<p>His stomach grumbled again, demanding to be fed. Ranma sat up, sighing<br/>as he did. He really didn't feel like eating canned food that night.<p>(I think I'll have some rabbit...)<p>He got up, engaged his Kijin Shikaku and went to look for animal life<br/>signatures.<p>(Gonna get that move right after dinner... Yeah!)<p>**********<p>(Right after dinner my ass.)<p>Slowly, Ranma bit into the skewered pieces of meat, barbequed to just<br/>before the meat was scorched. He slowly chewed his food, sitting under<br/>a tree against which he leaned.<p>Normally, he would have inhaled the barbequed chicken. At the moment,<br/>however, he didn't feel particularly voracious. He wasn't even<br/>particularly hungry. Ranma had bought the chicken from a yatai just<br/>outside the park he was in because he didn't know what else to do.<p>It had been twenty six days since that weekend in the forest just<br/>outside of Tokyo. All in all, twenty eight days of training and failed<br/>attempts, each forever burned into his mind. Four weekends worth of<br/>training trips.<p>All which had amounted to nothing.<p>Ranma had pushed himself to the limit of his abilities; being Genma's<br/>heir, that was quite a distance. It wasn't enough, it seemed and so<br/>Ranma went beyond himself.<p>Seeing that technique alone yielded nothing, Ranma turned to physical<br/>training. From the dojo he would sprint to secluded hills or beaches,<br/>to find the biggest boulders he could find. These he pushed, dragged<br/>and as time went on, carried, threw and juggled. Limited strength<br/>wasn't an issue - that was where chi came in. In fact, chi was the<br/>entire point. Ranma used his chi a lot.<p>When he felt his reserves drop dangerously low, Ranma would<br/>practically force himself to rest, with every non-vital muscle group<br/>falling limp. Even his nervous system would partially shut down to<br/>minimize energy consumption and replenish his reserves. Within hours,<br/>though of late usually less, he would resume his training.<p>At least once a day, he would attempt either one or both of the moves<br/>he sought. Every single attempt would fail. He told himself that his<br/>chi wasn't focused enough or wasn't strong enough and he would run off<br/>to push himself further. Other times he felt that he lacked finesse,<br/>thus he made sure that each successive attempt was more controlled<br/>than the last one. Always making sure, always pushing further, always<br/>trying harder.<p>On top of everything, no one knew of where he went, what he did. After<br/>dinner, he would sneak away quietly to wherever he felt he should<br/>train. At first he would sneak away normally, but after numerous<br/>attempts by various parties to follow him, he employed the Way of the<br/>Silent Thief. It was a sealed technique, he knew, but Saotome Ranma<br/>would be damned if a bunch of curious people stood between him and his<br/>martial arts.<p>Taking a sip of his soda, Ranma sighed. He felt tired. Really, really<br/>tired. It wasn't physical; that was something he knew how to correct<br/>very quickly. No, his problem was mental fatigue.<p>(God... my head hurts...)<p>(Stupid techniques... stupid school... stupid STUPID school! I can't<br/>believe they think I- Argh! They're stupid!)<p>(Heh. They can't call Saotome Ranma stupid anymore, though. Stupid<br/>guys don't get seventy-three for history. Hah!)<p>(Damned if I know what I'm gonna use history for, though.)<p>(God damn! My head hurts...)<p>(Hmm... that cloud looks like a duck! Heh... wonder what the guy's<br/>doin' right now...)<p>(Hey! I actually feel better with my head tilted like this!)<p>(Ohh yeah... this is much better. Man, this is great.)<p>(Mmm... gonna stay here till-)<p>"YOU are Saotome Ranma? A kid?"<p>(Heh. Figures.)<p>(Danger sense hasn't gone off though.)<p>(Guess I'll wait.)<p>(Damn, this is a nice breeze.)<p>(Mmm... wow. That bakery down the street must've just made a new batch<br/>of bread.)<p>(Hey... that smells like-)<p>"Get up kid. This is a challenge."<p>(Yeah right. Ya don't sound like Herb. Ya don't sound like Saffron.<br/>And c-c-ca- em... can't talk. I'm really gonna get up for ya.)<p>(Man this breeze is superb...)<p>(Maybe I should get Mom to cook-)<p>"What's the matter kid? Too scared that ya hafta pretend not to hear<br/>me?"<p>(Sigh)<p>(Maybe-)<p>"Scared lil kiddies shouldn't walk by themselves. You should stick<br/>with your momma, just like a CHICKEN!"<p>Ranma's eyes shot open, quickly narrowing into slits.<p>****<p>Akane gripped the handle of her school bag harder. She, along with<br/>just about everyone else present, could feel the suspense and tension<br/>in the air.<p>(Ranma you baka! What are you doing?)<p>More than anyone else though, she was overwhelmed with worry for her<br/>fiancé. He had been acting far too strangely for far too long. To make<br/>it worse, it seemed that whatever it was that he was doing didn't<br/>involve her. Her only comfort was the fact that he had left out all of<br/>his other suitors as well.<p>"Get up kid. This is a challenge," said the challenger.<p>Taking her eyes off Ranma for a moment, Akane considered the<br/>challenger. The young man - Akane placed him to be twenty five -<br/>looked fairly powerful, standing six feet tall and built like a prize<br/>heavyweight boxer. He had a menacing countenance, his jeans and muscle<br/>shirt were well worn.<p>Like the others present, she had heard that someone had come to Nerima<br/>to challenge Ranma and that her fiancé was last seen heading into the<br/>park. She rushed there, along with others eager for a fight.<p>"What's the matter kid? Too scared that ya hafta pretend not to hear<br/>me?" taunted the young man, sneering.<p>Looking back at Ranma, Akane felt her worry grow. Ranma should have<br/>answered the challenge by now, smirking with confidence and bouncing<br/>around the challenger.<p>(What's wrong with you? You JERK!) Akane unknowingly grit her teeth.<p>(You act weird for a whole month, you don't tell me what's going on,<br/>and here's someone you can beat up and show how hot a martial artist<br/>you are you won't even get up and fight him and let me know you're<br/>alright! You are SUCH A JERK!)<p>A slight blue aura sprang up around Akane. Those nearby took note and<br/>stepped back.<p>(You're more than a jerk! You're-)<p>"-a CHICKEN!"<p>All of a sudden Ranma's eyes shot open and in the blink of an eye he<br/>was on his feet.<p>"YESSS!"<p>Everybody, including Ranma and the challenger, blinked with an audible<br/>'piku-piku' and turned to regard Akane, who was widely grinning while<br/>looking very relieved, a single arm pumped in a celebratory pose.<p>Understandably, Akane blushed like mad, and lowered her arm and eyes.<p>"The name's Senbuzaku Kitaro," Akane heard the challenger announce.<br/>Looking up, she saw that Ranma and Kitaro were regarding each other,<br/>no doubt sizing each other up.<p>Popping his knuckles, Kitaro said with a menacing grin, "I'm going to<br/>grind you into paste, Black Iron Claw style!"<p>"Right," Ranma said, his voice as flat as his gaze.<p>(Black Iron Claw?) thought Akane. She had never heard of it before.<p>Kitaro lowered himself into a stance, and brought his arms up, That<br/>was when Akane really noticed his arms. They were _muscular_. Not just<br/>muscled but very lean. She could make out each muscle group, even some<br/>muscle strands. Veins ran like pipelines down his biceps and forearms,<br/>and his fingers were in clawing positions.<p>Akane gasped.<p>The hands. They looked as if they could tear through a car.<p>(Be careful, Ranma.)<p>Kitaro frowned when he noticed that Ranma hadn't gotten into a stance,<br/>merely standing there with a flat gaze.<p>"Whassa' matter kid? Scared? Then why don't ya go running back to your<br/>momma?"<p>She saw Ranma tense, then slowly slid into a stance. His arms were<br/>still at his side though. Akane started to wonder about that when<br/>Ranma shot his arms out. In the same heartbeat he snapped them back in<br/>a motion so fast, so strong that the air around him silently exploded<br/>away like a brief gale.<p>Akane inhaled sharply, as did everyone else.<p>Kitaro gulped audibly. No one could fault him, though.<p>(What was that?) thought the Tendo girl, echoing the thoughts of so<br/>many others.<p>(Was it just the motions of his arms? Or something more?)<p>(Where did that depression around his feet come from?)<p>Suddenly Kitaro rushed forward, clawed hand going straight for his<br/>opponent's face. Ranma merely wove to the side. Kitaro pressed his<br/>charge, changing the failed attack into an elbow strike.<p>Again Ranma evaded the attack, stepping close to Kitaro, whose other<br/>arm shot upwards in a clawed uppercut, missed, and in a flash came<br/>down elbow first. Kitaro stepped forward, the first arm lashing out<br/>again. Ranma wove, moving into Kitaro's blind spot. A leg lashed out<br/>in a high back kick which, having missed, rapidly came down. Kitaro<br/>spun on that leg, executing a viscious reverse spin kick.<p>Which, incidently, struck air.<p>Kitaro turned to face Ranma, who still showed no interest, merely<br/>gazing flatly at him. The older man felt his eyebrow twitch; the boy<br/>was toying with him. He charged again.<p>This time Kitaro pressed his onslaught for two whole minutes,<br/>employing very aggressive techniques. The crowd had long realized that<br/>he was no slouch, not when they could hear how the air whistled as he<br/>clawed for Ranma.<p>The pigtailed boy, on the other hand, hadn't executed as much as a<br/>block. In fact it was painfully obvious he didn't think much of his<br/>challenger as he ducked, bobbed and wove without much effort.<p>Akane was wringing her school bag in trepidation. (Something's wrong.)<br/>Ranma always fought on the challenger's level. (Except with me. Jerk.)<p>Spinning quickly to compensate from a failed strike, Kitaro turned to<br/>face Ranma. He was gasping for breath, and didn't look particularly<br/>pleased.<p>"What the fuck? Fight me! Fight me you worthless son of a bitch!"<p>Ranma's face darkened into a terrible scowl. Before the eye could<br/>blink, he was less than an arm's length away from his foul-mouthed<br/>challenger. Kitaro's jaw nearly fell off in disbelief at the speed,<br/>when he caught himself and rained punches, claws, elbows and knees<br/>onto his opponent.<p>It was clearly pointless though, as Ranma blocked each and every<br/>strike. He blocked them deftly, his faceetched in a terrible scowl<br/>that made Kitaro's heart skip a beat more than once.<p>The rain of blows continued for roughly five seconds - suddenly<br/>Kitaro found himself staggering backwards, arms thrown wide. Again<br/>Ranma rushed him. This time, it was with such intensity that Kitaro<br/>felt that time slowed down.<p>He could see with alarming clarity every detail on Ranma's face; how<br/>the boy's eyes narrowed in anger, how his mouth curled in disgust.<p>Above all, Kitaro noticed how unstoppable Ranma looked.<p>Then, Ranma was in his face, their noses nearly touching. Years from<br/>then, Senbuzaku Kitaro would remember the boy's voice. So calm, yet so<br/>cold, so focused that despite being a slight whisper everyone heard<br/>what Ranma said.<p>"You should've left my Momma out of this."<p>With that, Ranma pivoted on his right leg and sent a palm strike into<br/>Kitaro's solar plexus _hard_. The challenger flew backwards like an<br/>artillery shell, losing consciousness long before he smashed into the<br/>wall on the far side of the park.<p>****<p>For a few long seconds, silence reigned. Some of the crowd looked in<br/>the direction where the challenger had flown off to. The rest looked<br/>at the uncharacteriscally furious Ranma. No one really knew what to<br/>say.<p>Suddenly, someone sneezed and the spell broke. The silent crowd<br/>instantly turned into a buzzing one.<p>"Damn, that was short."<p>"I'll say. One of the tamest fights I've seen for a bit."<p>"Man, not even _one_ chi blast. Bummer."<p>"So much for spilt blood and broken bones. Saotome must've been pissed<br/>though. He usually plays around with 'em a bit more."<p>"Pay up, Jiro."<p>"Argh! He lost?"<p>"You bet against Ranma? Man, how about you just _give_ me your pocket<br/>money next time?"<p>"Ranma-san looks better than ever!"<p>"You've said it-"<p>Tuning out the not so hushed whispers, Ranma turned and started to<br/>walk away. Maybe he could find another place to rest at.<p>He didn't notice the single person walking a distance away behind him,<br/>following him. Ranma was in some far away land and his expression said<br/>that much.<p>The pigtailed boy was nearly out of the park when the person called<br/>out. "Ranma?"<p>Ranma gave no sign of having heard it, continuing to walk casually,<br/>hands in his pocket.<p>"Ranma!"<p>Still the young Saotome continued, not even flinching at the tone<br/>used.<p>Then, in a soft, lilting voice more appropriately used to beckon<br/>newborn babies, the person gently said, "Baka?"<p>Instantly Ranma stopped, and turned around to see Akane looking at him<br/>with a slightly confused and hopeful look. "Yeah, Akane?"<p>Akane's confused look turned into one of mirth, and moments later she<br/>was giggling so badly, that her body shook as she held her sides.<p>"You.." talking was hard when you were giggling.<p>"I'm what?" asked an understandably irritated Ranma.<p>"You... answered..." that was all Akane managed, and she giggled<br/>uncontrollably again.<p>Ranma began to look quite cross and folded his arms across his chest,<br/>regarding his fiancée. Fortunately, Akane sensed his irritation and<br/>managed to control herself. Her mirthful look again became slightly<br/>worried and hopeful.<p>"I..." she managed, obviously having a hard time.<p>Her fiancé was beginning to wonder what it was all about and if it was<br/>good for his continued well-being. "Yeah?"<p>Barely whispering, Akane tried again. "I..."<p>It was taking a ridiculous amount of time, he thought. "Wh-"<p>"Want to go have some ice cream with me?" Akane blurted. Her cheeks<br/>were a bit redder than usual, and she looked to one side, avoiding<br/>Ranma's eyes.<p>"Huh?" said Ranma, _quite_ intelligently. He had lost the irritated<br/>look, gaining a stupefied one.<p>Ranma's floundering look boosted Akane's confidence somewhat. "The<br/>ice-cream shop is just around the corner. Want to have some?" she<br/>asked, looking into his eyes.<p>"Um..." Ranma started to say something, and caught himself. A puzzled<br/>look danced across his features for a few seconds. Again he started to<br/>say something, when he saw something in Akane's eyes. Their gazes<br/>locked, and he found himself quite speechless.<p>In fact, both Tendo and Saotome were at loss for words. Neither knew<br/>how long they stood rooted at the park entrance, either.<p>"Woohoo!"<p>"Lookit the lovebirds!"<p>"Straight outta the movies!"<p>Fortunately - or unfortunately, depending on your point of view -<br/>the audience from the fight earlier was there to bring them back to<br/>reality.<p>Snapped out of their trance, the two of them wordlessly reached an<br/>agreement, and quickly shuffled out of the park with as much dignity<br/>as they could gather.<p>Their beet red faces, however, completely ruined the effect.<p>**********<p>"You really like ice-cream, don't you Ranma?" asked Akane.<p>They had just left the ice-cream parlour, and were strolling down the<br/>street. The crowd was of moderate size, mostly young people like<br/>themselves out to enjoy the late Friday afternoon.<p>Her fiancé snorted. "They're okay, I guess," he replied nonchalantly.<p>"Just 'okay'?" she quizzed.<p>"Well... yeah. It's not like I'm crazy 'bout 'em or nothin'," came the<br/>answer.<p>Akane glanced sideways at him. "I see," she said. "Is that why you<br/>have ice-cream dripping from your hair?"<p>Ranma froze in his tracks. Slowly, he turned his head sideways to look<br/>at his fiancée, a quizzical look on his face. Smiling warmly, she<br/>returned his look, and nodded.<p>"Gaah!" he shouted, arms a frenzied blur as he patted away furiously<br/>at his hair. Ranma wasn't too particular about his appearance, - a<br/>manly man's natural devastatingly good looks would always shine<br/>through, afterall - but looking like an idiot was anathema to him.<br/>That was what people like Tsubasa, Kuno and Ryouga were for.<p>"Is it gone? Is it gone?" he asked Akane, in a nearly desperate tone.<p>He didn't get an answer though; Akane was too busy giggling at the<br/>sight of him. Ranma felt his ire rise, only to deflate a moment later<br/>as he took in the sight of his fiancée, looking so lively, so<br/>carefree.<p>She looked so happy. With him. Maybe it was okay to let her in close,<br/>just this once.<p>For the third time that day, Ranma started to say something, only to<br/>lose the words on the tip of his tongue.<p>(Damn... I give up...) he thought, settling for a rueful shake of his<br/>head, and continued to walk on.<p>It took a few moments for Akane to realize that she was giggling by<br/>her lonesome, and she moved to catch up with Ranma, skipping as she<br/>went. It had been too long since she enjoyed herself and she was<br/>cherishing each moment.<p>She fell in step with Ranma, who was sulking. Her smile grew; there<br/>was something about seeing a childish frown on a young man who could<br/>wield the energies needed to level a mountain.<p>After a few more moments of silence and sulking, Akane glanced at<br/>Ranma again. "Oh, stop being such a grouch," she admonished, still<br/>smiling.<p>Ranma's only response was to stomp his feet as he plodded along,<br/>sulking even more than before. Akane had to bite her tongue to keep<br/>herself from laughing out loud; the sight of Ranma like that was too<br/>much.<p>Finally regaining control of herself, Akane went back to his side. He<br/>was still sulking. "Oh, c'mon Ranma." Seeing no response, Akane<br/>stepped closer to the pigtailed youth and timing herself, used her hip<br/>to gently nudge him.<p>Ranma nearly stumbled, but caught himself. He threw his fiancée an<br/>irritated look, which she countered with a sunny smile. A slight<br/>breeze blew her hair across her features, and Ranma crumbled. Sighing,<br/>he gave her a small smile and continued to walk. He said nothing; even<br/>Saotome Ranma could learn that it was futile to try to say something<br/>to Akane that day.<p>The two continued to walk silently. Occasionally they would bump into<br/>each other, but neither said a word. Ranma kept his peace; the<br/>occasional contact felt like taking Akane's hand and leading her out<br/>of Ryuugenzawa. That had been too long ago, he thought.<p>Akane had a most contented look.<p>They had just passed the cinema when Akane realized that Ranma had<br/>fallen behind. She turned around, to see him staring into space. Akane<br/>stepped up to him, frowning cutely.<p>"Ranma?"<p>Instead of replying, he continued to stand rooted, staring into the<br/>distance.<p>Reaching out, she gave his sleeve a slight tug. "Ranma?" she tried<br/>again.<p>The tug got his attention. He looked at her briefly and then back at<br/>where he was staring.<p>Not knowing what to make of the situation, Akane stood next to Ranma<br/>and looked in the same direction. "What are you looking at?"<p>"That guy," said Ranma, his voice low and controlled, "at the<br/>cigarrette stand."<p>After a brief search, Akane found the vendor, and the man who was<br/>currently its single customer. He was dressed in a smart black suit,<br/>wearing designer shades, about thirty years old and looked very, very<br/>normal.<p>"Yeah, I see him. What's wrong with him? He looks okay to me."<p>"He's- look!" the urgency in his voice made her focus on the man, who<br/>was walking to a black Mercedes. Akane still couldn't find anything<br/>amiss.<p>"Look at what? Ranma, you-"<p>"He," Ranma interjected, voice full of conviction and focus, "is<br/>_strong_, Akane. Don't you see it?"<p>Bewildered, Akane looked again, nearly squinting her eyes trying to<br/>find what Ranma found so fascinating. The man walked over to the<br/>passenger side of the car, and got in.<p>"I don't-"<p>"I'm gonna lose him!"<p>"Huh?" Akane was starting to worry. Ranma had never acted like this<br/>before.<p>"Here," said Ranma, pushing his school satchel into Akane's arms.<br/>"Take this. I'll try to be back by dinner."<p>"What? Ranma- Ranma!" she all but shouted at her fiancé, who was<br/>already running after the black vehicle. It was no use. Even if he had<br/>heard her, Ranma made no sign of slowing down.<p>Akane stood rooted, watching Ranma disappear into the crowd. She felt<br/>her eyes dew a little. It wasn't because their improptu date was no<br/>more. It wasn't because she felt cheated that he ran off without<br/>telling her what was going on.<p>It was because of the sinking feeling she felt inside, that something<br/>bad was going to happen.<p>She sniffled once, clutching his school bag tightly.<p>"Come back."<p>**********<p>Saotome Ranma was in a quandary.<p>Actually, he was in a plaza that was facing a tall building, but he<br/>was also in a quandary.<p>He had chased after the black Mercedes through the streets of Tokyo.<br/>Luckily for him, his pursuit had taken place just at the start of rush<br/>hour. The world-famous traffic jams of Tokyo had allowed him to follow<br/>the car without having to resort to prolonged chi-enhanced measures.<br/>He could have handled it, but it wouldn't have been convenient.<p>The chase had led him to the tall office building across the plaza.<br/>After spending nearly an hour in the traffic jam, the car had stopped<br/>outside the building. The man that had so intrigued Ranma stepped out<br/>of the car, and into Michigawa Tower, its name emblazoned over the<br/>entrance . The car drove away, but Ranma's attention was then focused<br/>only on the sixty-odd story building.<p>That had been three hours ago.<p>It was already dark, and the evening crowd had thickened. Ranma was<br/>painfully aware that most of the people walking the streets at the<br/>moment was out to have dinner, as his stomach rumbled.<p>The youth steeled himself. There would be time for food later. He just<br/>_had_ to find out who that guy was and what he was about.<p>Aside from Herb, Ranma had never seen anyone so strong in Tokyo.<p>The man was strong, no question about it. Probably as strong as Herb,<br/>who was physically stonger than Saffron, although the Phoenix god's<br/>imitation of a fusion reactor was so good that a fight against Herb<br/>would most probably be level, if not one sided.<p>Ranma shifted to sit cross-legged on the stone bench, contemplating.<p>What was a man that strong doing in Tokyo? Ranma hadn't even needed to<br/>engage his Kijin Shikaku to know that the guy was strong. The way the<br/>man moved was enough. Even to most martially trained eye, the man had<br/>a normal gait. The young Saotome was anything but normal; to his eyes<br/>the man was a walking tsunami.<p>Unstoppable.<p>It would be hard to explain that to anyone, the youth realized. The<br/>only way Ranma could think of how to describe the man's walk, was that<br/>it was very much like his own.<p>Actually, it was a walk more advanced and accomplished than his, but<br/>being Saotome Ranma, it was to be understood that it was only a matter<br/>of time until he caught up.<p>(A month of training should do it. Nahh... make that two weeks.)<p>A passing spirit heard his thoughts and rolled its ethereal eyes<br/>heavenwards. The spirit quickly shuffled away; the boy's confidence<br/>was overwhelming.<p>Ignoring his rumbling stomach - a truly great feat by male Saotome<br/>standards - Ranma continued his contemplation, keeping his eyes on<br/>the building entrance.<p>What was the man doing in the building?<p>Who was he? A martial artist?<p>How did he get that strong?<p>What would a man that strong be doing in a business establishment as<br/>grand as the Tower?<p>Was he a businessman? Or a hired arm?<p>The pigtailed youth was starting to get another headache.<p>He was about to shift his stand when a thought struck him: what if the<br/>man had left the building by means of another exit?<p>All of a sudden, the boy was a nervously pacing one, mental gears<br/>nearly audible as he thought of what he should do. He suddenly stopped<br/>cold in his tracks, a grin blossoming. He had the perfect solution.<p>Kijin Shikaku. Demon God Eyesight.<p>Turning to face the building, the boy brought forth memories of how to<br/>distinguish human chi from other energies. Proper mindset ready, he<br/>focused his attention squarely on the Tower. He engaged the Kijin<br/>Shikaku.<p>Ranma gasped, and immediately the Kijin Shikaku dissipated. He spent<br/>the better part of five minutes catching his breath, trying calm<br/>himself down.<p>Finally getting his breath back, Ranma turned to look at the top<br/>floor. He had been expecting to see a single aura field five, maybe<br/>ten times more powerful than that of a normal human.<p>He saw five fields. Three at tenfold. One at twenty. The last nearly<br/>forty. All in the same room.<p>Ranma cursed under his breath. If before he had been in a quandary,<br/>then he was at the moment at a definite mental road block.<p>"Hell! Now what do I do?"<p>**********<p>(I can't believe I'm doing this.)<p>Ranma stepped into Michigawa Tower, slipping through the sliding door<br/>as an employee left the building.<p>(Pop's gonna kill me if he finds out about this.)<p>He was invisible. Courtesy of the Umi Sen Ken.<p>(Heh. Not that I'd let him, but damn he can be a pain in the ass when<br/>he wants to be.)<p>Gingerly he walked past the security post in the lobby. His soft<br/>slippers weren't making a sound, but he wasn't taking any chances.<p>(Then again, he's a pain in the ass all the time. Now what?)<p>He was standing in the elevator lobby. There were eight elevators in<br/>two rows, a plaque above each indicating which floors it serviced.<p>(One to ten... eleven to twenty.. hmm.. forty-one to fifty...<br/>fifty-one to fifty-seven... Supreme Levels? Huh?)<p>The last one was emblazoned above an elevator with an extra stylish<br/>façade. The doors were inlaid with a golden peacock instead of the<br/>silver flowers on the other doors, and was framed in intricately<br/>carved teak.<p>(Top floors, I guess. Well, this is my ride. Now- damn!)<p>Unlike the other elevators, the Supreme Levels lift had more than just<br/>a button. To one side of the teak frame was a glass panel framed in<br/>chrome. Ranma watched enough spy movies to know that it was a<br/>biometric sensor; not that Ranma knew the word biometry, but he knew<br/>trying to use it would backfire.<p>(Shit! Now what?)<p>He looked around, trying to find anything that would take him to the<br/>top floors, or at least give him an idea how to reach them. He found<br/>none.<p>(Well...)<p>Ranma walked over to the elevator for the fifty-seventh floor. He<br/>pushed the button, and the doors opened. Muttering a silent prayer, he<br/>stepped inside, and as the doors closed, hit the button marked '57'.<p>(Damn... the things I do to be the best...)<p>****<p>Slowly, the still invisible Ranma stepped out of the elevator. The<br/>ride had been uneventful, but that didn't stop his heartbeat from<br/>rising.<p>The lobby was a tastefully lit corridor, though each of its end was<br/>dim. It was eleven o'clock afterall, and even the industrious Japanese<br/>knew when to call it a day.<p>Picking a random direction, the youth headed for one end of the<br/>corridor. It lead to a poshly decorated foyer, a reception counter<br/>facing the entrance. The counter was empty, and the areas behind the<br/>glass doors on both sides of the counter was dark.<p>(No one home, I guess.)<p>He made his way to one of the glass doors, and gave it a little push.<br/>The door stayed shut.<p>(Damn. Hmm..?)<p>His eyes caught sight of a softly illuminated panel on one side of the<br/>door. It was a keypad, its buttons luminous green. There was no other<br/>visible means of unlocking the door.<p>(Shit. I have a feeling I'm gonna see a lot more of this.)<p>A quick check to the other door, and a dash down the corridor<br/>confirmed his hunch. Keypads all around, all the doors requiring<br/>keycodes or proximity cards to be opened. No alternative entrances<br/>were visible.<p>(Great. Now what?)<p>The youth made his way back to the lobby, feeling quite irritated, as<br/>well as a touch of disappointment. Glancing around, he saw a green and<br/>white sign above a wooden door.<p>(The stairs!)<p>Gleefully, Ranma made his way to the door. Turning the handle, he<br/>pulled the door open as quietly as he could. The act was pointless,<br/>since the hinges were well oiled and silent, but it paid to be<br/>cautious.<p>Ranma stepped through the door, and into the stairwell, softly<br/>illuminated by a pale white bulb. Grinning, he made a move for the<br/>stairs leading up, when he realized the sound of the door closing<br/>could travel all the way down and into wary ears. Without looking, he<br/>reached out to grab the handle.<p>Only to grab empty air.<p>(Huh?)<p>He immediately spun around and saw that his side of the door had no<br/>handle. In a flash his arm shot out, his hand catching the door just<br/>as it was about to hit the jamb.<p>Ranma stood there for a few seconds, panting. Having caught his<br/>breath, he examined the door and its frame.<p>There was no knob, or handle, just another keypad to one side of the<br/>door which swung outward from the staircase. One did not have to be a<br/>genius to guess all the doors on the stairwell were similarly<br/>protected. Had he not caught the door when he did, Ranma would have<br/>been trapped in the stairwell, the only unlocked exit being the door<br/>right behind the security desk in the lobby.<p>(What the hell is wrong with these people? Don't they trust anyone<br/>anymore?)<p>Stepping back into the lobby, the boy closed the door gently behind<br/>him. He sighed quietly.<p>(Now _what_?)<p>He was beginning to feel frustrated, a familiar feeling of late.<p>(Hmm... what to they do in the movies? Let's see... that's it! Air<br/>vents!)<p>Quickly he turned his attention to the ceiling, and nearly yelped in<br/>surprise. He was looking up, straight into a security camera. Forcing<br/>himself to calm down, he quickly checked his Silent Thief technique.<p>It was still engaged. Ranma gave a heavy sigh of relief.<p>(This _definitely_ ain't the Tendo house.)<p>Scanning the ceiling, he quickly caught sight of a vent, part of the<br/>air ventilation system. Ranma leapt straight up and grabbed the<br/>stainless steel frame. He effortlessly clung to the frame; it was a<br/>Saotome specialty.<p>(Please let this work. Please Kami-sama let this work.)<p>He inspected the grill, looking for screws. Finding none, he slipped<br/>his fingers into the grill and gave a quick tug. It gave away.<p>(Yes! Something that works! Yes!)<p>Examining the grill, now hanging by its hinges, he found that the<br/>grill was secured by clips.<p>(And away.. we go!)<p>Ranma quickly clambered up the air vent, carefully pulling the grill<br/>behind him until he heard the telltale 'click.'<p>**********<p>"Urd! What are you doing?" hissed a very irritated goddess.<p>"I'm searching the database, what's it look like?" answered the<br/>Goddess of the Past, equally irritated, if not more.<p>"You can't do that! You're suspended! In fact you shouldn't be here,<br/>you nitwit!" Skuld gestured at the console of the Goddess Relief<br/>Office.<p>Urd ignored her sister, and tapped away furiously at the console. A<br/>few moments passed, and she threw up her arms in frustration.<p>"I can't get in!"<p>"Well duh! You're suspended. Of course you can't get in," said Skuld,<br/>smirking. "Or have you forgotten the basic rules, hmm? Old age<br/>catching up with you, Urd?"<p>The elder goddess gave no sign noticing her sister's taunt, and looked<br/>deep in thought. A thought struck her, and she snapped her attention<br/>back to Skuld.<p>"Your licence is active."<p>"Well _I_ wasn't the goddess who exceeded her Profanity Quota by a<br/>factor of-"<p>"Help me."<p>Silence.<p>"What?" Skuld nearly screeched. Never in a hundred years did she<br/>expect to hear Urd say what she had just said, in the way she just<br/>did. It sounded like she was pleading. To Skuld.<p>"I need to find this mortal. Now. I can't access the system, you can."<p>"Uh-uh." Skuld backed away from Urd, shaking her head. "No way. I'm<br/>not risking my licence. Uh-uh."<p>"Skuld, I need to find him."<p>The younger goddess was at a loss. Her sister had never been like<br/>this.<p>"I said no. I could get in seri-"<p>"Please, Skuld," said Urd. She had dropped onto one knee and held her<br/>sister's shoulders. "I _need_ to find him. Please."<p>Skuld was speechless. She couldn't think of anything to say. It was<br/>too weird. She could only nod once, the back of her mind yelling that<br/>it was a big mistake.<p>**********<p>(Finally!)<p>After fifteen minutes of feeling his way through the shaft, taking<br/>random lefts, rights, a single up, more lefts, more rights, Ranma<br/>finally came to a grill that did not drop down into an elevator lobby.<br/>Peering past the grill, he saw no obstacles below, and carefully<br/>popped the grill open. He dropped through the opening, grabbing the<br/>frame as he came out, and swung himself up again, hugging the ceiling<br/>like an oversized spider.<p>Gently he closed the grill. From his vantage point, he looked about<br/>underneath. He was in a darkened corridor, with no one to be seen in<br/>any direction. Still, he decided to keep the Silent Thief engaged.<p>Satisfied with the situation, Ranma loosened his grip on the vent<br/>frame, and landed quietly on his feet.<p>(Now to find that guy... lessee...)<p>A brief flash of Kijin Shikaku yielded nothing. A sliver of light<br/>strayed into the hallway from under a door somewhere in the distance,<br/>and that ridiculously small amount of light was enough to illuminate<br/>the whole place for him.<p>There was no sign of his quarries, however.<p>(Huh?)<p>Again, he engaged the technique and slowly turned around, scanning the<br/>entire level for the powerful auras. Nothing.<p>(Where'd they go?)<p>Ranma faced the end of the darkened corridor, and channeled more chi<br/>into his cornea than before. Still, nothing. He was about to turn<br/>around and face the other end of the corridor when something tugged at<br/>his heightened senses.<p>(What...)<p>He peered into the corridor. There was nothing to be seen, save for a<br/>vase on a side table of dark wood with a rectangular top.<p>(There's nothin' there... why do I get the feeling there is?)<p>Squinting his eyes, he still found nothing. His Kijin Shikaku was<br/>telling him otherwise.<p>(What the- wait...)<p>He calmed himself, and gathered his breath, focusing more chi than he<br/>had ever used for the Kijin Shikaku, or even the Mouko Takabisha. It<br/>took Ranma about a full second to channel the gathered chi into a<br/>super strong Kijin Shikaku.<p>(Shit!)<p>Now in plain sight, was a web of thin red lights. There were so many,<br/>each crossing so many others that the end result looked like a<br/>spider's web.<p>(Ohh.. shit!)<p>At first, Ranma looked at the strands in the distance. Realizing that<br/>some were pointing in his direction, he slowly lowered his eyes,<br/>following the strands.<p>They passed through his chest. His abdomen. His left knee. His right<br/>ankle.<p>(Oh fuck.)<p>Ranma did the only thing he could think of. He _froze_.<p>There had been many, many times in his lifetime, that Ranma had cursed<br/>his idiotic father, for whatever reason. This was not one of those<br/>moments.<p>The Umi Sen Ken was the only thing that kept his body from breaking<br/>the laser strands.<p>(Keep calm Ranma. Keep calm. Remember the movies? The lights don't<br/>break, your ass is safe. Turn around... see? Them lights so straight,<br/>you're safe.)<p>(That's it... you're one cool dude Ranma. No need to worry 'bout the<br/>light thru yer chest, leg... no need to worry bout that web in f-)<p>(...)<p>(...web...)<p>The pigtailed martial artist stared at the web of lasers. The web<br/>looked as if woven. He had seen a web of light before. But at the<br/>moment he didn't think of it as a web.<p>He thought of it as a mat.<p>A mat of soft blue light.<p>(Kami-sama...)<p>He disengaged the Kijin Shikaku, and gathered his chi again. His face<br/>was a mask of stony determination.<p>Ranma straightened both his arms out. First he channeled intensely<br/>focused chi into his right arm. Feeling his appendage awash with<br/>power, he channeled chi into his left arm.<p>The moment of truth.<p>Each arm served as a conductor for a flow of chi so intense, that each<br/>arm had a polarized chi field. Countless individual chi strands flowed<br/>in a single direction, each never crossing another. So intense was<br/>this field, that the chi field was firmly oriented in whatever<br/>direction the arm was pointed.<p>The boy crossed his arms, the right a few inches above the left.<p>Ranma projected the chi from the arms and into the space between them.<p>Instant soft blue square mat.<p>Immediately Ranma forced his will into the mat. The mat was extremely<br/>responsive to his will, and in a split second Ranma wove the mat into<br/>the Second Construct.<p>The mat disappeared.<p>He inhaled sharply.<p>(No... it's still there... I can feel it.)<p>Remembering what the Second Construct did, Ranma slowly made his way<br/>towards the vase and the side table, Silent Thief still engaged.<p>(Calm down boy... there's nothing to be worried about...)<p>Ranma inched towards the table, heart pounding, not really knowing<br/>what to expect. He pressed forward, slowly, when something happened.<p>The corner of the table disappeared, as if suddenly chipped away with<br/>an ultra sharp scalpel. Ranma could see the cross section, though it<br/>was blurred for some reason.<p>Forcing himself to remain calm, Ranma stepped forward again. More of<br/>the table disappeared, along with one of it's legs. The table remained<br/>standing.<p>Again he stepped forward, and this time half the vase disappeared,<br/>with it half the table. He could see straight into the vase.<p>(What the...)<p>Ranma was about to step forward again, when a hunch made him look<br/>about a hundred and twenty degrees to the left.<p>It was all that Ranma could to stop himself from shaking. There, to<br/>his left, was half a table, with half a vase, standing upright, just<br/>like the half table and half vase on his right.<p>Gulping audibly, Ranma took a small step to the right. Immediately<br/>what remained of the vase disappeared, along with a portion of the<br/>table. Glancing to the left, Ranma saw that the vase was now complete,<br/>and what was missing of the table on his right, was now added to the<br/>portion on his left.<p>(Kami-sama...)<p>He slowly moved to his left, to see a portion of the vase and table<br/>disappear, only to reappear on his right. He repeated the experiment a<br/>few times.<p>The conclusion: the second chi construct resulted in a field whose<br/>spherical boundary could, upon contact, translate matter to another<br/>point on the boundary, where the entry and exit points form a chord<br/>within the sphere, while maintaining structural and material<br/>integrity.<p>Of course, Ranma's conclusion was slightly simpler.<p>(Shit! I can make the damn table pass me! Shit! It disappears there!<br/>It comes back on the other side! The damn table's in two places at<br/>once! Half is there! The other half is there! But it's still in one<br/>piece! I can control how much goes there, or there... shit! SHIT!)<p>Saotome Ranma, eloquene defined.<p>Ranma was about to continue his internal ranting when a thought struck<br/>him. He disengaged the Second Construct, gathered and channeled his<br/>chi into his arms. He crossed his arms, and projected his chi. Again<br/>the blue mat appeared, hovering between his arms.<p>Instead of folding it into the Second Construct, Ranma willed it to<br/>move. Just like the first time, the mat instantly complied, and it<br/>shot to a point three feet away from Ranma. It hovered.<p>He willed the mat into the Second Construct. It disappeared.<p>The young Saotome inhaled deeply. He knew the construct was there,<br/>even if he couldn't see it.<p>Tentatively, he reached out. He was expecting to feel a tingling<br/>sensation, or something, but nothing came. He did however, see his<br/>fingers disappear from sight. Then his hand, up to his wrist.<p>Ranma looked up, and saw his hand hanging above the edge of the table.<p>(Damn...)<p>He took a step forward, and sent more of his arm into the barrier, to<br/>see it disappear up to his elbow, and appear above the table.<br/>Tentatively, he grabbed the vase, lifted it and withdrew his arm. He<br/>stepped back, and pulled his arm clear of the boundary.<p>Correction. He pulled back his arm and the vase from the boundary.<p>(Oh kami...)<p>His arms were shaking. Ranma couldn't help it. He had NEVER been this<br/>excited in his life.<p>Arms still shaking, Ranma gently straightened his arm again, watched<br/>it disappear with the vase. As expected both reappeared above the<br/>table, and he put the vase down very carefully. He withdrew his arm,<br/>and disengaged the Second Construct, immediately feeling slightly<br/>drained.<p>Ranma was beyond happy. He was beyond jubilant. He-<p>"YES!"<p>- was still a baka.<p>****<p>"Sir!"<p>"Yes, corporal?"<p>"Optical sensors tripped. Phonic sensors tripped. Supreme Level One.<br/>Sector zero-eight. Sector is supposed to be empty."<p>"Glitch?"<p>"Phonic sensors recorded a hundred-twenty decible peak."<p>"Scramble all teams. Where are our distinguished executives?"<p>"The Executive Elevator is on its way down. I'm guessing they're about<br/>to leave."<p>"Page the elevator. They'll want to know."<p>****<p>(Oh shit.)<p>Ranma was clamping his mouth with both his hands.<p>(Did anyone hear that?)<p>He remained very still. Even with the Silent Thief still active, he<br/>wasn't taking any chances.<p>More chances, that was.<p>(Hmm... I could've sworn I put that vase down exactly where I picked<br/>it up... hmm...)<p>Ranma was very sure he put the vase down in its exact spot. He engaged<br/>his Kijin Shikaku, just to be safe.<p>(Crap...)<p>A single red strand was broken. The lip of the vase was a centimeter<br/>too far to the left.<p>(Shit! Oh shit! What do I do? What do I do?)<p>He was about to pace, when he looked down to the floor and engaged his<br/>Kijin Shikaku.<p>(Oh bloody shit!)<p>Thirty single-fold chi fields were making their way up. They were in<br/>the elevators. They were in the stairwells. That wasn't the bad news<br/>though.<p>The bad news were the five nova fields. Two ascending very fast. Three<br/>slower.<p>(Those five! Oh damn! The stairs! Oh shit! The lift! Oh fuck!)<p>Ranma was starting to get extremely nervous. He could evade the normal<br/>people easily. The five, however...<p>Who knew how sensitive they were to ki? For all he knew they could<br/>sense the Silent Thief if they were close enough.<p>(Damn! Gotta get outta here!)<p>He ran towards one end of corridor, towards the elevator lobby. That<br/>was the only way out.<p>His way was blocked by a doule glass door. He pushed. It didn't move.<br/>He pulled. It still didn't move.<p>Ranma was about to kick down the glass doors when his eyes caught<br/>sight of a green light by door. Looking closely, he saw it was the LED<br/>indicator of a switch. With nothing else to go by, he pushed the<br/>switch.<p>The doors opened.<p>He ran past the doors, and into the elevator lobby.<p>(Now what? Now what? Now- Stairsstairsstairs...)<p>He quickly pushed the door to the stairwell open, and took the stairs<br/>one flight at a time upwards. Going downwards wasn't an option.<p>(Smart one Saotome. Be curious. Yeah. Be just like Nabiki. Be smart,<br/>be strong. Good one Saotome. Be Proud. Yeah.)<p>Within five seconds he made it to the end of the stairs, at the final<br/>door at the top. Which, incidentally, did not have a handle or a knob,<br/>just a little panel to one side.<p>(SHIT!)<p>He searched for a switch. None. That left only one option.<p>(Gonna hafta kick it down. Hope they don't mind or 'nuth- waiiit a<br/>minute!)<p>Ranma stood back from the door, focused his chi into his arms, created<br/>the blue mat, sent it into the door, and engaged the Second Construct.<p>(Kami-sama let this work, please!)<p>The young Saotome dove head first into the unseen barrier.<p>The immediate change of scenery from wooden door to starry night was<br/>extremely disorienting. Ranma did his best to stay standing.<p>(I... I did it!)<p>He turned around to face the door.<p>(I went right through!)<p>The Second Construct was there, he could feel it. Ranma had to resist<br/>the temptation of jumping through the field again just for the heck of<br/>it.<p>(Time for that later moron!)<p>Ranma turned his back to the door, and disengaged the Second Construct<br/>as he started to walk away. It was with no small surprise that Ranma<br/>found himself on his knees, panting.<p>(Oh man! That move really sucks the life outta ya! No wonder I nearly<br/>died that day!)<p>He forced himself to his feet; it wasn't a good idea to stick around.<br/>Running to the ledge of the roof, he saw that he was a good twenty<br/>stories above the tallest adjacent building.<p>(Damn!)<p>Quikly he made for the opposite ledge and peered over. It was at least<br/>thirty stories down.<p>(All right, I'm screwed.)<p>Suddenly, his hackles rose.<p>(Oh shit. Something's coming.)<p>His heartrate doubled.<p>(Oh I am SO screwed!)<p>Looking around, he saw for the first time that it wasn't a simple roof<br/>he was on. The roof had a helipad.<p>The scaffolds of a helipad made for a lot of space to hide in.<p>(Be cool Saotome. You've got nothin' to be afraid of. No one can hide<br/>fr-)<p>"Ranma?"<p>****<p>Chaos.<p>Chaos slithered around its Avatar. Its best ever.<p>Soon its avatar would turn the gods themselves topsy turvy.<p>Chaos would have laughed out loud, if it could.<p>The stops had been pulled. Mortals and non-mortals alike would be<br/>effected. In fact, its Avatar would feel the effect very, very soon.<p>Its Avatar was going to feel something he had never felt before.<p>Lust.<p>****<p>A bad shiver ran down his spine. That voice behind him.<p>That feminine, silky voice.<p>"Ranma? Where are you?"<p>Slowly, Ranma turned around, eyes closed.<p>"Dam- uh... darn it! Where is he?" said the voice, hushed. "I saw<br/>Skuld pull up those files myself."<p>Ranma opened his eyes.<p>It was the woman from the temple, standing not five meters away. He<br/>nearly died soon after they had first met; he had all but forgotten<br/>about her. Even the intensely rapturous moment he laid eyes on her a<br/>month ago was nearly lost to him.<p>That intense moment was coming back - with a vengeance.<p>His knees shook. He had trouble breathing. He lost his focus, and the<br/>Silent Thief dissipated.<p>The woman's eyes widened, no doubt surprised to see him materialize<br/>out of thin air.<p>Ranma felt himself tingling all over. He _knew_ the woman felt the<br/>same.<p>A breeze blew, carrying with it the scent of the woman, which Ranma<br/>caught. The smell made the tingling worse; in fact he was starting to<br/>feel very, very warm, but he needed more. There was only one other<br/>source of warmth on the rooftop.<p>That very source of warmth started to walk towards him, hips swaying<br/>indulgently, though she was obviously restraining herself from running<br/>towards him. Her arms shook visibly. He knew it wasn't because of the<br/>wind.<p>He knew because his arms shook as well. His arms wanted to enfold her,<br/>his hands wanted to touch her.<p>Ranma had no idea what was happening to him, why he was acting this<br/>way over a stranger. He did know, however, that he wanted to be close<br/>to her, she to him.<p>Finally, they stood within an arm's length. He looked into her eyes.<p>Urd couldn't understand it. She had teleported to his location so that<br/>she could talk to him, to find out why she felt the way she did, to<br/>get answers. Instead, she was losing herself to him, and it felt so<br/>right. It felt so right to not be herself, so right not to resist in<br/>the least. She lost herself in his gaze.<p>"Why," he said, "are you here?"<p>She took in his words, and his voice, and shuddered. He had no doubt<br/>it was a ripple of ecstacy. "I came looking for you," she replied, in<br/>a shaky voice, seductive even in nervousness.<p>It was his turn to shudder, electricity running up and down his spine.<br/>It made him tingle. It made him warm. However, the warmth wasn't<br/>enough; he had to have more. The back of his mind was screaming that<br/>it was wrong, that this wasn't what he would do. The mental screams<br/>were silenced, however, by his desire for her. In fact, his desire<br/>rose when he saw the look in her eyes. It told him she _needed_ him<br/>too.<p>"You've found me," he said breathlessly. "What will you do with me?"<p>She gasped inwardly. What did she want with him? Urd searched herself,<br/>and found the answer.<p>"Everything," she said softly, nervously. "I want to do everything<br/>with you."<p>He inhaled sharply; it was the perfect answer. He stepped closer,<br/>reaching out to touch her delicate face.<p>She closed her eyes, nearly shaking in anticipation. She could sense<br/>his skin, inching towards her cheek.<p>He himself was shaking badly. The way the moonlight shone off her<br/>platinum hair was enough to make him lose control.<p>His fingers touched her cheek, and they were in their own private<br/>world. Their knees buckled, and they fell into each other's arms.<p>Warm. Oh so warm. So sensuously, addictively warm. Each had to have<br/>more, and their hands moved.<p>A world of their own indeed.<p>A world that was shattered at the sound of a door smashing open, of<br/>running feet.<p>"Halt!"<p>Of shouting voices.<p>Of an explosion that wrapped the world in absolute white.<p>"Argghhhhhhh!"<p>And of a shout full of pain that rang throughout the night.<p>==========<p>To be continued...<p>Foot Notes:<p>Finally! Finished it!<p>Sorry it took so long, but things got hairy on my end. Anyway, I hoped<br/>you guys liked it. Personally, I didn't think this chapter was all<br/>that good, but hey, I'm new at this. I'll try to do better next time,<br/>I promise.<p>Some of you might notice that parts of this chapter bear resemblence<br/>to Carrot's "Gaijin #19". To be specific, the part with sneaking into<br/>buildings via air ducts. Just to be clear, I didn't copy it from him.<br/>I finished this fic about a month before he released that chapter. I<br/>posted the draft on a forum (no, NOT the Delphi forum), and members<br/>can attest to that. It took a while for me to get the final version<br/>out.<p>And NO, I am not saying that he ripped my idea. We both ripped someone<br/>else's idea (as did John Woo), and wrote our stories at roughly the<br/>same time. So spare me the plagiarism speech or I shall get quite<br/>cross.<p>This chapter might have birthed some unanswered questions, especially<br/>regarding Ranma's new moves. I'll get around to answering them in<br/>later chapters.<p>A HUGE thanks to my pre-readers, namely Rezantis, Mads, Magus, Ranma<br/>Saotome, Corwin, KPJAM, Brian Randall, Latin_D, dracos, Akraen,<br/>Gabriel Blessing, Kinematics, Thermopyle and all those who bothered to<br/>read and c&amp;c the draft. Apologies to those I've left out; it seems<br/>i've botched up the list of names. Really sorry about that. To you<br/>guys, thanks for the suggestions. I've tried my best to accomodate all<br/>of them, but unfortunately, some of them would take major rewrites of<br/>the fic. I would've done it, but I fear for my sanity. I'm barely<br/>clinging to sanity as it is ^^;;<p>Also a heartfelt thank you to all of you who took the time to write in<br/>and give me encouragement. Cheers to Moon Klutz for sending me a nice<br/>mail that got me off my butt to start this chapter. 2 Cheers to Dragonbard<br/>for them mails!<p>I would like to apologize for any and all grammar/spelling boo-boos.<br/>English isn't my first language, and I'm not any good in my first<br/>language either.<p>If you think this is beginning to sound like a rejected Oscar's<br/>acceptance speech, let me explain:<p>1. I'm really sorry that this chapter is late.<br/>2. I'm really grateful for the support and help I've received.<br/>3. I wanted to make the fic seem longer than it really is, for all<br/>those people keeping an eye on the page countdown. Did you like the<br/>ending? ^_^<br/>4. Yes, I'm feeling plenty pleased with myself, why do you ask?<p>*grins*<p>Any question, comment, input, tell me you hate/like the story/me,<br/>donations, etc to "".
