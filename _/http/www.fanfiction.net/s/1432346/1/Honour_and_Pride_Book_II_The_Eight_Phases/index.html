</div><p><b><i>Honour And Pride</i></b></p><p>By Beer-Monster</p><p>Book II: The Eight Phases.</p><p><i>Chapter One: The Wind Of The  Willows</i></p><p><i>The Journey of a thousand  miles,</i></p><p><i>Begins with </i><i>the first step. </i><b>Lao  Tsu.</b></p><p>The wind howled like a banshee. The sky was dark and grey,  the sun swallowed by a sea of thick, black clouds. Rain and melting snow  dripped and dribbled from the trees, small droplets clinging in dewy beads to  the fine tips of the conifers finger-like leaves. The angry gusts rustled the  evergreens, making them sway as if in blustering mockery of the other trees  whose boughs had long since been stripped by winter's icy touch.</p><p>The irate, redhead brushed another conifer branch  aside as it jutted in her path like a curious feeler. Her shoes squelched as  they trudged through the wet dirt, slush and snowmelt surging around her ankles  and soaking her feet. One hand shivered and trembled as it held the ties of her  thick coat in white, clammy fist, pulling it closer around her small form. The  other hand returned to the meagre warmth offered by her pocket.</p><p>The back of the heavy, quilted jacket was embroidered  with two characters; the Japanese Kanji similar enough to the ancestor Chinese  for any of the locals to determine its meaning. They stood for 'Wild horse'.</p><p>Ranma was freezing.</p><p>In his time spent with the Tendos he had forgotten the  harshness of travel, and he had certainly forgotten the coldness. The again he  never had gone wandering through northwestern China in the depths of winter.  Her entire body was numb with the cold, her bones felt encased in ice, and she  could not even feel her toes. Her breath clouded in misty vapour before her,  and as she inhaled she seemed to suck in a lungful of ice, the bitter air  burning in her chest. The wind was biting, snapping at her red face and  chapping lips, freezing the sweat that formed on her head from the effort of  carrying two heaving packs.</p><p>The one source of heat came from the small, black  piglet that shuddered beneath her coat, clamped against beneath large breasts  by the her arm as it held the jacket closed. Ryoga snorted and squirmed,  jabbing her with his small hooves.</p><p><i>What  a jerk!</i> Ranma thought angrily. <i>He gets to stay all warm and cosy inside my jacket, while I have to  face the elements and carry his bloody luggage. </i>But on the bright side at  least his nosebleed had stopped, meaning she no longer had to hold two fingers  over his haemorrhaging nostrils.</p><p>Another vehicle passed along the dirt caked road, a  small, simple white van. Its spinning wheels kicked up a fine spray of filthy  water, which splattered on her face. Grumbling she raised her hand from her  pocket and wiped the brown liquid from her face and then clawed away the damp,  red bangs that clung wetly to her brow. She had entertained the thought of  using the seductive appeal of her cursed form to attract a driver and convince  him to give them a lift, she doubted that wet, dirty and cold was a flattering  look for her. Besides she had no way to ask such help. Ryoga had done all the  talking, but that did not help right then as pigs made poor translators.</p><p>Ranma had been surprised by the lost boy's grasp of  languages, and had watched awe-struck as he had spoke fluently with the  shopkeepers and other locals they had met. Seeing her shock, Ryoga had of course  rubbed her nose in it, claiming that he also spoke excellent English, Spanish  and Arabic. Ranma did not doubt him; he probably knew how to say, " Where the  hell am I?" and " Which way to the Tendo dojo?" in Swahili too.</p><p>Obviously being completely without a sense of  direction had its fringe benefits as well as pitfalls. Their arrival here was  an example of both.</p><p>It had been a week since they had left Nerima  together, and they had arrived in China three days ago.</p><p>At least she guessed three days ago. Travelling with  Ryoga it was difficult to tell. She had let him lead once they left Tokyo,  barely noticing the landscapes or the towns they passed. It was when the signs  had become incomprehensible and the people had started speaking in another  language that she realised they were in China. She could not recall passing the  ocean; the only expanse of water was a small stream that was easily jumped  over. Yet the thousand of bikes in the towns and skinned dogs in the butchers  shop had only confirmed her suspicions.</p><p>A discreet inquiry, ruined by Ryoga screaming for  directions at all who passed, had revealed that they were in China's Si Chuan  province. In two days walking they had come cross-country from the Pacific  Ocean and Japan, just as Ranma had hoped.</p><p>Not willing to rack her brains pondering the  meta-physics of the Ryoga phenomenon, she shrugged.</p><p><i>Beats swimming, </i>she thought.</p><p>A sudden sharp gust of wind chilled her spine and she  pulled her coat around herself tighter. P-Chan squirmed and snorted in protest  at the sudden pressure, but Ranma ignored him. She squinted through the winds  and focussed ahead, her eyes fixed upon the mountains that loomed ahead, with  their gigantic presence and majesty dominating the horizon.</p><p>Amongst those rocky heights and sweeping plateaus lay  their destination. Mount Emei, its snow-feathered peaks hidden behind a sea of  grey clouds. The foothills of that natural spire were said to be the home of  many great and beautiful temples, Buddhist and Taoist faiths living side-by-side  in harmony with nature.</p><p>Or so had said the old man who had owned the grocery  store in the last town. Recognising them as Japanese he had assumed them to be  tourists and advised that they visit the mountain and it's temples for their  great beauty and history.  Ranma had not  been too interested, but Ryoga had insisted they go, declaring that they "might  as well take a look since they had not anywhere else to go nor anything else  planned." The pigtailed youth had suspected his companion was trying to get rid  of him by avoiding the challenges and Martial arts that he yearned for. But  Ranma had to admit that Ryoga was right, that they had no other plans or any  destination in mind.</p><p>Besides, it was strangely comforting to be heading  somewhere definite instead of the Russian roulette that came from following the  directionless fighter.</p><p>Glancing up at the sky Ranma regarded the grey clouds  carefully. The mountain and the town at its base were still miles away. She  could continue walking, yet she was so tired. Her legs ached, and body was  numb, her arms feeling like dead, frozen weights. It would be best for her to  rest a while, and to heat up some water. This fragile body seemed to retain no  heat, and she could also get that lazy pig to carry his own pack.</p><p>Moving from the road she headed into the dense wood  that's surrounded her. Feeling glad of the shelter from the biting winds  provided by the trees. Finding a small clearing, amongst the thick forest she  set her burdens down. She then sighed with relief, stretching and rotating  shoulders that burned with the long-carried weight of the two packs.</p><p>Reaching under her coat she pulled the pig from his  hideaway, and flung him unceremoniously to the ground. P-Chan bounced twice on  the damp, soil before landing upside down, his trotters waving frantically in  the air. After righting himself the piglet snorted indignantly and launched  itself at Ranma's ankle. The redhead squawked in pain as the angry, black  piglet attached itself to his foot with its fangs. After a series of frenzied  hops, Ranma managed to extract P-Chan's grip, sending the piglet flying across  the clearing with a kick.</p><p>"What was that for you crazy hog?" she protested.</p><p>An irritated verse of oinks and bwees was his reply, as  the pig bounced on its little legs in a fit of restless rage.</p><p>Ranma ignored his cursed companions anger, although he  was confused with how Ryoga had managed to give him the 'bird' with his  inflexible hooves, instead setting herself to gathering sticks and twigs, for  kindling. She pulled a packet of firelighters from Ryoga's bag, breaking the  grey bricks and setting them into a tumbled pile, then knelt onto all fours,  bending to let the flames from her small, cheap cigarette lighter dance over  the firelighters. After several attempts, her thumb rubbed raw from grinding  the lighter's wheel, a small fire blazed with merry, orange light.</p><p>She grimaced while returning to Ryoga's pack, noticing  the dampness of the ground had soaked through the knees of her black pants, and  stained them with its dirt. Ranma rummaged through the sack and pulled out a  bottle of water, pouring the contents into a small pot and setting it on the  fire to boil, she then turned to the piglet.</p><p>"You can use the water first P-brain, I'm fed up with  having to carry your pork butt."</p><p>P-Chan responded with a series of angry noises, but  Ranma talked over them. "I'm gonna see if the trees kept any of the wood dry  enough to use as kindling. Might as well try to save on firelighters." She then  fixed the small pig with a firm glare.</p><p>"You'd better save me some of that water though, or  I'll sell you to the next butchers' shop!"</p><p>Spinning on her heel she stomped off into in to the  shadows.</p><p>The pot rattled as steam wafted from the top. P-Chan  shuffled over to the flames, and with practised but cautious tugs, inched the  pot little by little of the flames. Then after several attempts and ingenuity  beyond that of his porcine form he managed to tip a steaming surge of the hot  liquid over his head. He grimaced in pain as the hot water scolded his skin,  but it was lost in the blurring metamorphosis of his growing form.</p><p>Now human again, Ryoga shivered as the icy winds  blasted his slick and naked body. Teeth chattering, he rushed over to his pack,  retaining a crouched posture with hands cupped over his groin in an empty but  instinctual gesture of modesty. Rummaging through its contents he withdrew a  set of dry but rumpled clothes. He began pulling them on swiftly, throwing  himself into his boxers and black pants in an urgent effort to shield himself  from winter's caress. Not wanting to walk barefoot on the wet and muddy ground  any longer, his shoes were next, followed by the binding around his calves.  Yet' as he attempted to don a black T-shirt and his customary coarse, yellow  jerkin, furious gusts snatched the garments from his grip and carried them  across the clearing and into the darkness beneath the crowded trees. Biting  back a series of curses and somehow knowing this was all Ranma's fault, he  trudged after it.</p><p>He bent to seize his clothes in his left fist, his  weight sinking forward onto his front foot, only for the ground to give way  beneath the stress, sending him staggering forwards. He wind milled his arms in  an attempt to keep his balance, yet his feet could find no purchase in the wet  mud. Slipping forwards he grasped vainly and the surrounding trees, until the  earth vanished beneath his feet.</p><p>A momentary feeling of weightlessness was accompanied  by his own, shocked, cry, and the cracking of breaking wood, then came a  frightened scream. He dimly noticed that the second voice was not his own,  before lights flashed before his eyes and darkness rolled in.</p><p>He awoke with a start, his body jerking him into  consciousness, motes of light swirling across his eyes. He shook his head to  clear them from his vision, but its did not clear the numbness from his brain  which felt stuffed with cotton. Through the haze he became aware of rapid hard  impacts jarring his shoulders.</p><p>"Get off me you pervert! " A panicked and  extremely angry voice shrieked in a flurry of syllables he recognised to be  Chinese. Digging his hands into the dirt beneath his shoulders Ryoga pushed  himself up and glanced downwards. His    green eyes locked with a pair of rage-filled, jade orbs.</p><p>And then from beneath him, a knee slammed hard into  his crotch.</p><p>Eyes wide and mouth falling slack, he managed a small,  pained croak from the back of his throat. Muscles locked by pain, he barely  managed to roll over to his side, before he curled into to a huddled ball, body  coiling defensively around his sore groin, lances of pain shooting from his  balls through his entire frame.</p><p>His attacker did not stop there. Pulling themselves  up, they began planting outraged kicks and stamps to his ribs and flanks but  Ryoga barely noticed the blows, his body toughened beyond such hits and his  mind distracted by other much larger pains.</p><p>Fortunately years of vengeance driven training came  instinctively to his rescue. Moving his hands from their cupped grasp of his  injured manhood, he seized one of the attacker's leg and thrust it pack towards  its owner. Spinning on his back he swung his leg in a vicious arc that swept  his their legs from beneath them. Combined with the force of his push the  assailant flew through the air.</p><p>His opponent was no novice either and quickly  controlled their landing, breaking the fall with a loud slap and rolling to  their feet into a fighting stance. Ryoga rose to his own guard on bowed,  wobbling legs, mixed anger at himself for being caught out by that attack, and  rage at the perpetrator for employing such a cowardly tactic, arose in him.  Seizing onto that anger, he quashed the remaining pain in his groin and balled  his hands into fists.</p><p>Fangs bared, he shot a baleful glance at his opponent,  and felt his anger shrink as it was swamped by a horde of new emotions:  embarrassment, panic, puzzlement and the empty sensation of not knowing what to  do next. But then he was never good with girls.</p><p>Soft, golden bangs were feathered across a pair of  bright, emerald eyes still narrowed with hostility. Her lips were set in an  angry frown, her face slightly flushed through rage. Her clothes were a  miss-matched mix of modern and traditional, a pair of snug blue jeans and trainers  contrasting with the thick, Chinese shirt and thin sleeveless robe. The robe  was the most striking of the ensemble; it was long, hanging down to her calves,  and made of a fine blue material, embroidered with an elaborate design in  gilded threads, depicting what he thought was a phoenix. She glared at him  vehemently, her expression twisting as he dropped his stance.</p><p>" What's wrong pervert, realise your mistake?  " She sneered.</p><p>"I'm not a pervert," he yelled in retort.</p><p>The girl blinked rapidly, her face screwing up and her  brows furrowing in an expression of shock and puzzlement. Ryoga mentally kicked  himself as he realised that he had voiced his protest in Japanese. Calming  himself he repeated in Mandarin.</p><p>"I said I'm not a…"</p><p>"I understood you the first time." the girl broke in.  " But I'm still not stupid enough to believe it."</p><p>This time Ryoga felt his shock, his mouth dropping and  eyebrows crawling beneath his bandana.</p><p>"You speak Japanese?" He gasped. Her firm voice still  carried a slight accent, yet her speech was fluid nonetheless.</p><p>"Yes I speak Japanese. But this is hardly the time for  a comparative languages debate. I am supposed to be dealing out your just  punishment for indecently assaulting me. Now fight!" She spat the last part at him,  stamping her foot angrily.</p><p>"But you're a girl," he spluttered helplessly. The one  thing he was worse at than talking with girls was talking with angry girls.</p><p>"Of course I'm a girl. Unless you think you were  groping a man, in which case you would be a real pervert." The woman mocked,  with a derisive smirk.</p><p>Ryoga's face lit to cherry red, as he began babbling  embarrassed and enraged protests: his last sentence being the only intelligible  one. " I'm not a pervert, it was an accident."</p><p>"So you <i>accidentally</i>  manhandled me while half naked?" she asked dryly.</p><p>Ryoga glanced down at himself, and upon talking in the  sight of his shirtless, dirt-smeared torso, immediately yelped loudly in total  mortification. He felt suffused with heat as his whole body succumbed to a  bright blush. Immediately he started and tried to cover himself with crossed  arms, until he realised how stupid a man would look doing that and gazed at the  grassy earth, avoiding the girls probing glare. Finally he conquered his shame  by relying on a more familiar emotion; rage.</p><p>"Damn it. It was an accident. Ranma's the pervert not  me. Damn him. This is all his fault." Cursing his rival calmed him a little as  it always did. Supposition of guilt was a wonderful thing.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm sure this 'Ranma' forced you onto me  against your will." his accuser snorted.</p><p>"It was an accident." Ryoga cried. "I fell down the  bank." Gesturing with a finger he indicated the mounded wall of grass and root  entwined earth. The girl gave a dry bark of a laugh that held no humour.</p><p>"Ha. You expect me to believe that." she smiled  mockingly as her gaze traced the line to the spot indicated by his finger. The  smirk shrunk and then vanished from her lips and her eyes widened as she saw  the trails of dishevelled earth and the path of broken tree branches.</p><p>"Oh!" she managed after a while.</p><p>Ryoga watched as she moved across the clearing to his  landing spot. Bending down she gathered up his now mud-caked jerkin and reached  upwards to retrieve his dark tee shirt from where it dangled from an exposed  root. She did not turn to look at him until she was done, when she hastily  threw the articles in his direction. He snatched them out of the air  effortlessly but was too dumbfounded to thank her. He quickly pulled them over  his head in a rush to cover himself from her gaze.</p><p>She broke the silence.</p><p>"Um…err…Sorry about that. A girl can't be too careful  you know" She trailed off into a patch of nervous laughter. Not knowing what  else to do Ryoga joined her, shyly rubbing the back of his head.</p><p>"Oh that's okay…. It did look kind of look bad."</p><p>The girl smiled slightly at his words, "And sorry  about the low blow, too."</p><p>This time Ryoga just nodded not meeting her eyes. It was  much harder for any man to forgive a whack to the wedding tackle. Instead he  focussed his attention on furiously brushing some of the dirt from his clothes.  But the mud was wet, and had burrowed itself deep into the fabric.</p><p>"Let me take you into the town and pay to get that  washed." his former attacker said after observing his actions. "My family has  some influence in this district, I should be able to get that taken care of,  and find you a place to spend the night."</p><p>A girl was being remarkably nice to him, and talking  about finding a place to spend the night. Ryoga acted as he usually did when  faced with such a treat; panic. His face lit like a scarlet sunset, his  breathing coming in short, quickened gasps mixed with splutters and confused  babbling, "Well…that is…but…I couldn't…don't know you…and my friend…waiting…get  back."</p><p>The woman could not hold in the merry giggle at the  lost boy's pathetic, but oh so adorable display. Controlling herself she  managed to speak through lips that still threatened to curve into an amused  grin or fit of guffaws.</p><p>"Relax. I'm sure your friend will find us."</p><p>Ryoga's tension did fade, yet his lips tightened as he  thought of Ranma being called his friend. What on earth possessed him to say  that, they may travel together but the guy was still a git. He began to  consider the girl's offer, it would serve the jerk right to have to come  looking for him. Especially after he had expected Ryoga to sit and wait by the  kettle like some sort of trained, circus pig.</p><p>"If it's not too much trouble?" he asked, hand again  rubbing at his scalp.</p><p>"Of course not I insist." the girl replied with a warm  smile.</p><p>"In that case, it would be a big help." He extended a  shuddering hand with a fanged grin. " I'm Ryoga."</p><p>She took the offered gesture in a firm grip and shook  it once. "Willow." She replied. "They call me Willow."</p><p>Ranma spat a loud string of curses as she squatted in  the dirt, pants pooled in the dirt about her ankles. Ryoga did not know what he  was complaining about, he may have to stand on four feet when in his cursed  form, yet at least he could still relieve himself standing up. The hands that  held the tails of her coat about her waist tightened until the knuckles turned  white. Everyone else would think her foolish: concerned over a pointless thing  like the posture she urinated in. But to Ranma it was a slap in the face, a  constant and necessary reminder of the manhood that she had lost.</p><p>Finished she pulled her trousers back up and headed  back for the fire, and the hot water, unwilling to stay in her female body  another minute. Who cared if it rained again? The short time that she could  stand at full height, with larger, masculine muscles that did not feel the ache  of carrying a heavy pack and over-endowed breasts would still be a blessing.</p><p>Sighing she made a cursory glance for any dry twigs or  branches. She had never truly intended to find any, the search just an excuse,  not wanting Ryoga to see her crouching in the mud to perform a basic biological  function. It was no sudden appearance of feminine modesty but a desire to hide,  her shame at both the consequences and the inability to cope with those  consequences, brought by her curse. She knew it was not the way a martial  artist was supposed to act, but that privacy was sacred to her and she was glad  it was not that time of the month. Her small experience with that problem, had  made her glad to not have been born female, and grateful in such times hot  water had never been too far away.</p><p>Abandoning her search she returned to the clearing.  Her eyes widened quickly, then slowly narrowed, her jaw tightening as her teeth  clenched. The pig was gone. The fire still flickered and cracked and his pack  still lay by his own: yet it lay open, a few of the contents protruding in  disarray from the top. For a moment the thought that he had been attacked by  muggers or kidnapped flashed through her mind. Yet remembering that Ryoga was  more than a match for any gang of thieves (not that there were likely to be any  in the mountains,) and seeing the upturned and empty kettle, she opted for the  more satisfying idea that the jerk had gotten lost again.</p><p>She would have to make him suffer for it.</p><p>One in front of the other; step by step. Ryoga watched  one of his feet advance, land, and then bear his weight as the other leg swung  forwards to replace it, his body displaced forward through such a simple,  cyclic action. He had never before noticed how curious the process of walking  was, until he had been forced to learn how to do it upon four hooves. <i>Ranma doesn't realise how lucky he is </i>he  thought bitterly.</p><p>Now the lost boy watched his feet closely, not wanting  to be caught staring at the girl who walked next to him, but he could not help  the quick glances with which he studied her. His fangs chewed his lip at he  kept silent, wary of anything stupid slipping from his mouth.</p><p>"You don't say a lot do you?" Willow said with a  smile.</p><p>Ryoga blinked and started at her voice, then turned  and saw her looking back at him with her emerald eyes. <i>Quick say something you idiot,</i> his mind mentally snapped at him.</p><p>"I..er..don't have much to say…" He trailed of into  weak laughter, his hand straying to the back of his head. <i>Good one stupid, </i>his inner voice muttered dryly.</p><p>"Say anything, like whereabouts in Japan are you  from?" dhe asked.</p><p>"Um…I'm not sure…I think it's near Tokyo." he  muttered, idly wondering when the last time he saw his home was, and who the  hell was feeding his dog.</p><p>"You <i>think</i>  it's near Tokyo?" Willow repeated, her eyebrow quirking.</p><p>"I kinda wander around a lot. I haven't been home for  a while." He answered honestly, cursing his own stupidity for not even knowing  his own address.</p><p>She nodded as if she had expected his reply. " Thought  so. You don't really fit the bill of the typical tourist types we get around  here. So I take it you're a travelling martial artist then?"</p><p>"Yeah, I guess." He had never thought of it that way  before. It sounded better than getting lost and trying to find his bathroom, which  was much closer to the truth. Besides, now that he and Ranma were travelling  together, it was sort of a training voyage.</p><p>"How did you guess?" he asked.</p><p>"We get quite a few so called martial artists mixed in  with the tourists, all wanting to see the famous temples of Emei. But I could  tell from your fighting stance that you had trained much harder and with more  commitment than those part-timers." Ryoga smiled, glad that his skills had been  noticed. Far too many people used him only as a benchmark to assess Ranma, so  it was nice to be appreciated for his own work.</p><p>"Besides none of those schmucks had muscles like  yours."</p><p>The bandana-clad boy stumbled, taking frantic steps  and waving his arms wildly to avoid falling flat on his face, his face flushing  to a scarlet sunset. After he regaining his balance he glanced at the bemused  Willow, before becoming fascinated by his index fingers as he began twiddling  them around each other.</p><p>"You're a unique one aren't you?" the girl chortled. "  It was a compliment, relax. I was just saying that you must train hard. Not can  I have your children? Nor was it an invitation for hot and steamy sex. Calm  down."</p><p>Ryoga nodded dumbly as his mind fumbled for a change  in subject. <i>Hot and steamy…</i>Image of  this and the many other girls he knew, naked and sweaty invaded his mind. His  blood surged, as it did not whether to flood his nose or to go further down. <i>Great,</i> he snapped mentally,<i> She had to say that!</i></p><p>"So you do martial arts too?" He spluttered quickly.</p><p>She blinked, once, twice. Then her eyes widened. "Oh  yeah right. Yes I practise my family's own style of kung fu. How about you?  What style?"</p><p>Ryoga paused, "I guess I don't really have a style. My  dad taught me a bit when I was a kid and I learnt what I could on my travels."</p><p>"Freestyle then?" She shrugged. " So long as it  works."</p><p>"Yeah that what I thought." Ryoga agreed with a nod. "  So what's your style called?"</p><p>"Bagua Zhang of Emei Mountain." She declared, chest  swelling.</p><p>"Bagua?" He repeated slowly, his tongue and lips  carefully shaping each syllable. Receiving no correction, the lost one assumed  that he had spoken it correctly. Then a fragment of a memory flickered through  his mind, long enough for him to seize the image of shining, circular ornament.</p><p>"Bagua? Aren't they those little mirrors that you buy  as good luck charms, supposed to frighten off evil spirit or something like  that." He flicked his wrist as if to dismiss such superstition.</p><p>Willow frowned, brows lowering. Ryoga panicked,  wondering what he had said to anger her. "Bagua means 'Eight trigrams', it is  the symbol on the charm not the mirror itself. And it is more than some  backwater superstition."</p><p>"I never said…" He trailed of as he took in the arch  of the blonde eyebrow on his companions face. It seemed to say 'who are you  trying to kid?" Giving up any attempt for an excuse he settled for a mumbled  apology.</p><p>Willow sighed heavily, "Don't worry about it, a lot of  people these days think such things ridiculous. The idea of charms and spirits  must seem a bit far fetched to someone from a sensible, modern place like  Japan."</p><p>Thinking about the weird things he had seen in his  life; the tunnel of lost love, the Oni that possessed him and Kasumi, his own  curse, Ryoga could not help but cast his eyes towards the ground. " No, I just  wasn't thinking." he said quietly. "If you had seen some of the stuff I have, a  charm would be very welcome."</p><p>Willow smiled. "The Bagua is a religious symbol more  than a charm." She said. "So the mirrors are not the best example of their use.  It comes from the I-ching, the Book of Changes, a book of great significance to  Taoist sects."</p><p>"Taoist? I thought that Emei, was a Buddhist  sanctuary?"</p><p>Willow was grinning widely. "It is: One of the Four  Holy Mountains of Chinese Buddhism. But as you'll see when you get there get to  see it for yourself, Mount Emei is said to be the 'Most Beautiful Mountain  Under heaven.' It is that beauty that made many religions feel that this would  be the perfect place to attain enlightenment. The first Temples here were  Taoist, and then came many Buddhist shrines. The peaceful harmony between both  religions is what allowed Emei martial arts to thrive."</p><p>"So it's a Taoist martial art then. Similar to how  Buddhist discipline developed at the Shaolin temple." Ryoga surmised.</p><p>Willow's blonde locks waved like sunlight as she shook  her head. " Taoist arts are very different from the arts of Shaolin. They focus  on the internal, not the external."</p><p>"Huh," Ryoga grunted, before wincing at how stupid he  sounded. He glanced sideways at his companion, who just chuckled. Pulling on a  fanged grin he forced out a weak laugh.</p><p>"What I mean is that Shaolin Kung Fu, developed from  physical exercises, like yoga. The idea was to keep the body strong and  healthy, and to learn spiritual discipline through external hardship. The arts  I practise are based upon exercise that try to develop your internal spiritual  energy, and thus harmonise it with the flow of energy in nature."</p><p>"You mean Ki? Ryoga asked, his grin spreading and  twisting into a smirk.</p><p>"Yes, that is the Japanese word for it isn't it?" She  nodded as if to confirm that with her self. "Bagua Zhang was originally  intended to develop one own Ki, and harmonise it with the Eight Phases of  nature, by performing movements and breathing exercises that imitate and  synchronise with those phases."</p><p>"So that must mean that you know a lot of Ki  techniques." The fanged youth cried, whipping round to face her in her  excitement.</p><p>The girl started at his sudden movement, regarding him  with wide eyes. " Er…yes I know one or two. Why do you ask?"</p><p>Ryoga put a hand behind his head and chuckled. <i>Damn, too keen!</i> He silently berated  himself. <i>Calm down Hibiki!</i> " Just  that's remarkable, I know a couple myself so I'm impressed. There not easy." <i>That' s it play it cool. Keep it casual;  make her want to tell you.</i> " So is the town nearby, " he glanced around  ostentatiously. " maybe we could get something to eat when we get there." <i>Keep her talking, Ryoga. Get her to tell you  all about her techniques, maybe even show you. That jerk Ranma won't know what  hit him.</i></p><p>"Yeah, I am a little hungry. That'd be nice." he heard  her reply.</p><p>"Great." He replied absently, and then his mental  image of a crying, defeated Ranma popped as her words, and his own, sunk into  his brain. <i>I just</i> <i>asked her on a date. </i>His jaw dropped. <i>And she said yes. </i>His eyes bogged open.</p><p>"Um…uh…uh." <i>What  about Akane, and Akari? </i>His mind screamed. "You see…I…we…" He looked at his  hands as he wrung them together, the knuckles popping quietly.</p><p>"So should we go?" she asked, " It's not far now."</p><p>The sound of her voice snapped him out of his near  comatose state. " What? Go? Yes, lets." He hurriedly strode off, laughing  weakly.</p><p>"Um…that's the wrong way."</p><p>The steel of the gate bent and folded under the force  of Brand's foot, the metal ringing in protest at the impact. Smiling widely, he  spun to parry the palm strike that was shooting towards his face. Pressed back,  he lashed out low with a leg sweep, caching his opponent's foot at the ankle  and toppling him. But the other man would not fall, and in an act of near  inhuman agility, used the swept limb to rebound off of the dented gate and  propel him into a backward somersault.</p><p>Brand felt a small sting as his foe flipped away to  land in a casual stance at several paces distance. The young man smirked  cockily, blue eyes flashing beneath a single, sharp, low-hanging bang as he ran  a manicured hand through his wild, irrational crest of blonde, spiked hair.</p><p>Brand rubbed dramatically at the tingling sensation in  his shoulder, not from the pain but rather to acknowledge the strike that had  hit it.</p><p>"Impressive," he conceded.</p><p>The blonde just shrugged, pushing back the folds of  his long, sleeveless robe and his burying his hands in the pockets of his pale  khakis. Then he glanced at Brand through the corners of his eyes.</p><p>"We're really going to have to work on your people skills,  Brand." He shook his head, with a series of elaborate tutting noises. "A flying  kick is really no way to greet anyone, let alone family. And look what you did  to the gate."</p><p>"Spare me the theatrics, Blitz, I thought you'd  appreciate the test." Brand replied with a glare.</p><p>His brother again shrugged, not removing his hands.  "If you want to spar with me, Chuckles, you could just ask." Blitz's lips  curled upwards soon after Brand felt his own twist. "But then I already did  once already today, and three times yesterday, and the day before that. What's  the matter? Can't get Cloud or Stone to fight with you."</p><p>"Both spend most of their time meditating, Stone in  the caves and Cloud is  up on the summit  as usual. Also Cloud spends the rest of his time with Tyde." Brand brushed a  layer of imaginary dirt from the shoulder of his robe.</p><p>"Well she has been ill of kate." Blitz muttered  sombrely. " It's only right that he should</p><p>Blitz paused respectfully, then asked "What of Crag or  Willow?"</p><p>"Crag's a simpleton, and Willow's not quite up to our  intensity yet, and I don't want to hurt her."</p><p>"Ever the protective older brother," the other man  remarked. "You don't seem to mind hurting me. In any case, I assume that the  old man is still in the library?"</p><p>Brand nodded, then glanced up at his companion.  "Besides all that," he grunted with a dismissive wave of his ringed hand. "You  are usually glad of the challenge."</p><p>The other man grinned widely. " That's true, our  matches are a worthy diversion, at least when there are no women about." The  larger man grimaced, but that just made the blonde smirk even more. " However,  do you not wish for a different challenge now and again?" The gleam in his  brother's eyes was impossible to miss. Brand could not help but smile himself.</p><p>"That's exactly what I wished to talk to you about."</p><p>"Oh," Blitz responded in a curious tone. "Then I take  it you've seen our talented tourist? I'm surprised you didn't act already."</p><p>"I can have patience when I want. But then I could ask  why you have not made a move yet, she was very cute, a redhead." he remarked,  absently running a hand through his own fiery curls.</p><p>"She?" Blitz's brow furrowed.</p><p>"Yes, she." Brand repeated, his own eyes narrowing in confusion.  "I saw her in the woods outside of town. She was leaping through the trees,  bouncing from branch to branch with the grace and precision that only comes  from training in the Arts. She managed it with two rather large packs, so that  means she must have some skills."</p><p>"The one I saw was not a girl." Blitz said with a  sidelong glance. " It was a large, muscular lad, with muddy clothes and a  bandana. He did not do anything out of the ordinary, but with his build and  clothing I assumed he must be a martial artist. And he must be a good one to  catch Willow's attention."</p><p>"WHAT!" Brand roared surging to his feet.</p><p>Blitz just looked back from the corner of his eyes,  brows still curled. " Yeah, he was in town with her, eating at the Purple  Onion, seemed quite cosy."</p><p>"COSY," Brand spat, hands balling into fists. "She's  on a date with some boy we don't know! A tourist."</p><p>"Calm down, Brand, don't you think your over-reacting?  She can take care of herself. I pity the guy if he tries to force anything on  her." Blitz said, wincing at the mental image of someone who got on the wrong  side of the girl's temper.</p><p>"So what, what if he tries to persuade her. Charm her.  You know what the tourists are like, always looking to put the moves on some  naïve Chinese girl. What if he gets smooth on her." He could not let that  happen. His baby sister was far too good for any man, let alone some  sweet-talking foreign lout with only one thought in his head.</p><p>"C'mon, how bad could he be?"</p><p>The large warrior glared at his spiky haired sibling,  and spat his reply back like a spear. " He could be like you."</p><p>Blitz's eyes widened and he leapt to his feet. "We'd  better hurry before she does something that I'd do."</p><p>Brand felt his lips slowly twist into a smile as he  cracked his knuckles.</p><p>The mouth-watering scent of cooking meat filled the  room, mingling within the steam that billowed throughout the open kitchen. Two  chefs yelled at each other loud, rushed Chinese as they bustled around the  cookers, shaking woks and chopping vegetables. The older, matronly waitress and  her younger and clumsier counter part wandered the café restlessly, pausing to  wipe at tables and chat to each other and the few other customers.</p><p>Ryoga eyed the pig carcasses, visible on their hooks  through the open wall of the kitchen and chewed on his lips, not noticing the  pain inflicted by his sharp fangs.</p><p>"Ryoga, you got some weird fetish about pigs?" Willow  asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>On hearing the word 'pig', the chopsticks in Ryoga's hand  snapped into splinters. Looking at the ruined pieces of wood, he laughed weakly  and tossed them onto the growing pile of eating implements he had already  broken.</p><p>"Pigs?" He felt beads of sweat blossom on his brow.  "W…What makes you say that?"</p><p>Willow chuckled. "I'm just kidding. Relax." She  gestured with her head towards the butchered pork. "It's just you've been  looking over there a lot, and looking kind of nervous. And I know it's not some  animal rights thing," She pointed at the remains of the beef bowl that the lost  boy had devoured.</p><p>"Um…well…" Ryoga's mind whirled through a wild flurry  of thoughts, flickering through possible excuses and weighing them for  plausibility. While this was going on his mouth moved and he babbled  senselessly. He always was pathetic at making up spontaneous excuses.</p><p>"I guess I shouldn't be surprised." Willow said  finally. " I doubt they hang their meat out so openly in Japan. Must look a bit  weird."</p><p>Ryoga barely managed to swallow his sigh of relief,  squashing it to a small, gulping noise. "Yeah, that's it." he said in a small  voice.</p><p>The elderly waitress came across and began clearing  the plates from in front of them. She shot a smile of crooked teeth at Ryoga,  who shuddered in reply. Turning away hastily, he reached into the pocket of his  pants for his wallet.</p><p>"I'll get this." He said. Ranma would be pissed off  about him spending what little money they had, but he had to be nice to the  girl if he wanted her to share her techniques. Besides it was the gentlemanly  thing to do, and he was always happy to irritate the pigtailed git.</p><p>" How much? " He asked the old woman in  Mandarin.</p><p>She smiled widely at him, and then beamed wider at  Willow, her grin approaching adulation. He noticed her dark eyes glancing over  the glided embroidery of the phoenix upon his new friend's robe. " No  charge, " She replied.</p><p>" Really? " Ryoga spluttered.</p><p>" Of course, " She grabbed the remaining bowls  and then trotted off. Ryoga glanced over at his companion with wide eyes.</p><p>"That happens often?" He asked.</p><p>The blonde girl shrugged, "As I said, my family has a  lot of respect in this town. It is a little embarrassing but what can I do,  they would be offended if I declined. Besides, you're not exactly rolling in  the Yuan." She arched her eyebrow at the few, crumpled bills in the dark-haired  boy's wallet.</p><p>Ryoga blushed, and rubbed at his scalp. "Well…it has  been a long trip." He muttered weakly.</p><p>Willow smiled warmly. " I understand, don't worry." She  pushed off of the table as she rose to her feet, smoothing out the dark  material of her thin robe. "C'mon lets see if we can get your clothes cleaned  for free too."</p><p>Ryoga nodded and followed her to the door. Once there  he watched Willow incline her head in a small almost benevolent bow towards the  waitress. The old woman in turn bowed low, almost bending double at the waist.  Thinking it to be customary, he repeated the gesture with a smile, only to  receive a grimace in response.</p><p>Shaking his head dumbly he joined Willow outside on  the street. The Purple Onion sat on a small lane, the road paved with round,  cobbled stones that set two cyclists shuddering as they rode across the uneven  stones. Tsing Ku was a small town, barely more than a stop for the tourists who  made there way along the main road from Cheng Du to see the sights that Mount  Emei had to offer. Filled with a few small houses, and the bare essentials  needed to supply the stream of foreign visitors and the monk that inhabited the  temples that the area was famous for. A polite place, where the few locals that  he saw greeted each other warmly on sight. The lost youth had seen hundreds of  humble places like this on his inadvertent travels, yet one bizarre feature of  this town struck a cord in his mind.</p><p>Every citizen: man, woman and child, no matter what  they were doing and or where they were going; immediately bowed deeply to the  golden haired girl that walked beside him.</p><p>"So…er…what exactly do your family do?" he asked, his  eyes trailing after the small child that skipped happily away after receiving a  smile from his companion.</p><p>Willow jumped, and he saw her gaze flicker to look at  him from the corners of her eyes, and then to the floor. " Um…I guess you could  call them scholars."</p><p>"Scholars?"</p><p>"Yes, we live on the mountain and research and records  old religious texts and stuff, very sacred work."</p><p>"Right, so are you monks or something?"</p><p>Willow chuckled at the suggestion. "If we were monks,  how could we be a family?"</p><p>Ryoga blushed, and scratched his head. "I guess," he  murmured.</p><p>Stars coruscated before his eyes as a screaming pain  blossomed in the back of his skull. Ryoga sagged to his knees, face pushed into  the pavement before him by the weight of the object that had just flown in to  his cranium. Growling, he pushed himself up with his hands, shrugging the bulky  projectile off from his torso. Glancing around the street, and blinking rapidly  to clear the coloured spots before his eyes, he made out a scarlet blur  standing before him.</p><p>"Ranma!" He spat.</p><p>The pigtailed girl frowned at him, arms crossed  beneath her breasts and foot tapping in a posture of such perfect womanly anger  to belie her true gender. Her pack hung from her shoulders whereas his own, lay  in a disarrayed heap by his side, leading to the conclusion that it had been  the object that was struck him.</p><p>Gathering himself on his feet, he returned Ranma's  glare with equal vehemence.</p><p>"Why the hell did you do that, you jerk?" he roared.</p><p>"Why the hell did you sod off without a word?" came  the reply.</p><p>Ryoga rubbed at the small lump that was blooming on  his head, and reached for his pack, preparing to re-launch it his nemesis. Yet  the path was blocked as Willow stepped to his side, the gold thread of the  phoenix shimmering on her robe. She laid a hand gently on his shoulder, and  pried his hand away from the bruise, regarding it her self. She smiled at him  reassuringly after recognising it to be a trivial matter.</p><p>"Ryoga, do you know this woman?" she asked, a hard  glare levelled at the redhead facing her.</p><p>"Unfortunately," he grunted.</p><p>Ranma's lips had curled into a smirk, one eyebrow  raising as he looked over the blonde in obvious appraisal, her eyes running  from the head of golden hair down the mismatched clothing and robe to the out  of place sneakers and back up. Willow just fidgeted, her mouth working silently  as the shorter girl judged her. Finally Ranma nodded and her grin widened.</p><p>"Well well, Ryoga," she chimed. "You ditched out on me  to pull a cute girl." Her red locks swayed as she tutted and shook her head,  but her smile never wavered. "Not very friendly, but I understand, you wanted  to play the ladies man. Wouldn't have thought you had it in you; I must be  rubbing off on you." She ran a hand through her hair in a cocky gesture</p><p>"Shut your mouth, Ranma," Ryoga grimaced.</p><p>Willow placed her hand on his shoulder and used it to  turn him slightly so that emerald irises could meet hazel. She wore a small  frown, her lips slightly parted and her gaze heavy through wide eyes.</p><p>"Ryoga, is she your girlfriend?" she asked softly.</p><p>His jaw dropped, moving soundlessly. His body jerked  and stiffened, and for several, long seconds he seemed locked in place. Then he  exploded into a torrent of rage-filled denials.</p><p>"WHAT!" he roared, his voice raising an octave through  sheer indignation. "Him! Are you insane! I hate his guts!" The furious rebuttal  ended as the dark-haired lad's face paled to a sickly, green and retching  noises were coughed from his mouth. " I'm going to throw up," he wailed  dramatically.</p><p>The frenzy of laughter that had accompanied his  reaction, fell silent. " Hey, you don't push my button's either Bacon-boy,"  Ranma said testily, but the shaking of her shoulders and occasional titters showed  her fight against amusement. With a small chortle she glanced at the other  girl.</p><p>"To come up with a dumb idea like that, I guess you  must be a natural blonde." She laughed again at her own wisecrack.</p><p>Ryoga's jaw tightened, his disgust vanishing as his  fangs ground against each other. He balled his hands into a fist and readied a  battle cry ready for when he launched at the young Saotome for insulting a  friend; but stopped as he noted the slight twitching of Willow's right eye.</p><p>"Was-that-a-blonde-joke?" She grated out word-by-word  through gritted teeth.</p><p>Ranma went stiff, face reddening as her jaw dropped.  Her eyes widened and she tugged at the collar of her scarlet shirt, throat  moving as she swallowed audibly.</p><p>"Um well. Yeah," her eyes flickered across her  surroundings feverishly. " But it was only a joke. Y'know kidding and all  that."</p><p>Ryoga could not help but smile, fangs biting into his  lips as he fought to suppress the fit of giggles that threatened to surge from  his throat. He failed however, and burst into laughter as he watched his rival  squirm. The lost boy imagined that Ranma found the taste of his own foot as  bitter as ever.</p><p>"I should have known," Willow sneered towards the  Saotome girl. "A dog like you would scare away more men than you could find.  Especially a guy like Ryoga."</p><p>The fanged boy felt his cheeks heat up. He focussed  upon his hands as he twirled his thumbs together. <i>I wonder what she meant by that!</i> He glanced sidelong at the young  blonde, but her eyes were still glaring lightening bolts at Ranma. The  pig-tailed one returned the glower earnestly, her small frame quivering as she  raised a white-knuckled fist.</p><p>"Dog, you mean like a golden retriever, Blondie,"  Ranma spat.</p><p>Willow's eye twitched again. " Was that another blonde  joke," she asked in a deadly whisper.</p><p>The corner of Ranma's lip curled higher. "Sure was,  why do I need to speak slower and use smaller words."</p><p>Ryoga frowned his brow furrowing as he observed the  exchange with out any clue. His gaze flickered back and forth, regarding each  woman in turn. They continued glaring at each other, Willow's jaw tightening  visibly as Ranma continued to smirk cockily. Ryoga knew and hated that smile,  and he had seen it many times, yet did not understand why the Anything-goes  heir would be wearing it now, as this was no challenge. Nor could he understand  the sudden change in his new friends demeanour, as Willow seethed from a few  low jibes, the type of petty shots one expected from Ranma.</p><p>A series of percussive pops shook the lost boy from  his wonderings, and he turned to see Willow begin to crack the knuckles on her  other hand, emitting the same jarring sounds.</p><p>"So, is this girl a friend of yours, Ryoga?" she  asked.</p><p>"That jerk, on a cold day in hell." Ryoga snapped  immediately and without thought. Instinctually incensed by the suggestion his  fangs bared themselves as he glared at Ranma from the corners of his eyes. He  then regarded Willow, who was now walking towards the smaller girl. She seemed  pleased with his answer, a smirk appearing on her face similar to the one that  had dropped from the redhead's and had been replaced by a bemused frown.</p><p>"And she can fight?" was the next question, but it needed  no answer and so Ranma replied with another question.</p><p>"And what if I can?" she said with a scowl.</p><p>Willow ignored her, twisting to look over her shoulder  at the fanged boy.</p><p>"So you don't mind if I have a little match with her.  Teach her some manners."</p><p>Ryoga blinked, and then his lips curled into a grin to  match hers. This was a very interesting development. He knew it was not really  fair, as Ranma would never fight full out against a woman. But then, the git  did deserve it; perhaps getting beaten by a girl would improve his manner  towards Akane. Also it would give Ryoga a great chance to see this Bagua Zhang  style, and if it possessed any techniques that would aid his quest to defeat  the pigtailed martial artist.</p><p>"Go right ahead," he said with a shrug.</p><p>Ranma fumed, "Ryoga, you traitorous jackass," she  yelled, cursing her life. A thought rose in her mind, one that she had surfaced  countless times before and that now bubbled up like miasma. <i>How do I get myself into these messes? </i>Said  the wrong thing at the wrong time, the usual way. She had only wanted to  embarrass Ryoga on what seemed to be (but was doubtfully) a date. Obviously his  new friend did not appreciate Ranma's sense of humour. But then she had not  responded well to the insults either.</p><p><i>Way  to make a first impression, retard </i>he swore at himself.  Question now was what to do about the situation.  </p><p>Her hands came up in a calming, warding gesture, knees  bending in readiness as Willow took her fighting stance. The blonde's leg was  held in front, toe just touching on the ground. Her back leg bowed towards him,  lowering height and her hand came up to guard, open palm tracing wide, flowing  circles in the air before her.</p><p>"Look can't we talk about this like civil people," the  pigtailed girl said weakly, hoping to talk her way out of this. <i>Like that ever works?</i></p><p>"Sound like you're scared," taunted Willow.</p><p>Ranma rose to the bait without thought. " Scared? Of a  ditzy blonde?"</p><p>The words sprung from her tongue and into the air. As  soon as she heard the retort, she clamped her hands over her mouth, as if  attempting to reseal the sentence back, behind her lips. <i>Crap.</i></p><p>Her face twisting into a furious grimace, Willow stuck  out, lunging forwards with a high palm strike. Ranma twisted out of the blows  path and stepped to the other girl's flank.</p><p>"Look we don't have to do this." she yelped, as she  raised both hands to block the incoming backhand. Willow snorted, and then slid  forwards in a swinging step. Ranma inched back, head snapping out of the path  of a short hook.</p><p>She did not see the other palm, which shot into her  gut. Grunting she brought both hands up defensively, but the blonde swung  another circling step, sweeping the petit redheads feet from beneath.</p><p>Ranma landed hard with a gasp. She grimaced as she  pulled herself up, "Ow." She muttered. Willow was smirking at her, yet the  gesture seemed cold and absent. Ryoga however was laughing loudly.</p><p>"Ranma getting beat by a girl." The fanged boy  taunted. "That's entertainment."</p><p>The pigtailed youth growled glaring daggers at the  chortling fool. Resuming a neutral posture she considered trying to reason with  the woman again. Yet, watching as the girl charged at her, Ranma decided it was  pointless. <i>Never worked with Akane or any  of the others anyway,</i> she remarked silently as she readied herself.</p><p>Swerving to the side, Ranma  blocked the assault, knocking aside a jab and rising palm strike combo with her  forearms before jamming the blonde's attempting kick by lashing out his knee.  Willow winced but pushed the attack, releasing another shifting series of open  handed blows.</p><p>Ranma effortlessly blocked,  and slid forwards to counter, holding himself back at the last moment. Willow  jumped on the opening, seizing the Japanese girl's still outstretched hand to  yank her forwards and onto her fist. Ranma gurgled as the wind was expelled  from her lungs, but her opponent was sliding to the side jabbing an elbow into  her ribs. She arched herself from the blow, which made her perfectly open for  the two palms that slammed into her back; iron fingers splayed forming a  dragon's mouth.</p><p>Already of balance, Ranma  was knocked from her feet by the blow, and sent tumbling to the dirt. Barely  catching herself on her hands before her nose was smashed on the floor. Teeth  gritting with effort, Ranma just managed to handspring to her feet.</p><p>"Crap!" She spat, rubbing at  her spine.</p><p>"Your own fault for trying  to hold back, sweetheart." Willow said,</p><p>"I don't fight girls." Ranma  protested, earning her a confused glare from her opponent.</p><p>"Strange thing to say, don't  suppose you've looked in the mirror lately. Or at your chest." Willow's eyebrow  quirked as she stared pointedly at Ranma's female form and its ample  endowments.</p><p>The pigtailed girl's face  coloured to match her fiery hair. "Appearances can be deceptive," she muttered.</p><p>"That is true," Willow  agreed with a shrug. "And that's why blonde jokes really piss me off." She  roared the last words as she launched her self, foot lashing out at Ranma's  head.</p><p>Ducking, the young Saotome  slid beneath the slashing limb and out of the range of any follow up attack. <i>I don't want to hurt her, it's not right.  But I've got to do something</i>, her mind was working furiously as her hands  blurred. She instinctively knocked aside another open-handed combo, jumping off  the ground to avoid a low sweep.</p><p>Landing in a crouch, she  spun striking out with her own foot, forcing Willow to back off. Coming back up  she adopted an open stance, presenting her side to her opponent on slightly  bowed legs, her arms bent at the elbows to form an open guard. She drew her  rear forearm level with her brow, finger splayed and pointing towards heaven,  her other arm covered her ribs hands clawing for the earth.</p><p>"Fancy," Willow remarked.  "And what do you call that."</p><p>"<i>Tenchi no Kamae,</i>" Ranma answered.</p><p>With a wary, narrow eyed  stare the blonde girl advanced slowly, shuffling carefully forwards on the  balls of her feet. Her hands swayed fluidly, outstretched before her, probing  like the flickering tongue of a snake.</p><p>"Too bad it leaves you  open," she cried, and on the last word attacked.</p><p>Ranma's hand came up to  intercept the blow, deflecting the incoming palm with her wrist as she flowed  to the Chinese girl's flank. As she moved her touch stuck softly to Willow's  arm, clinging like cotton as she redirected the strike, bringing to her centre.  Pulled off balance the taller girl took a hasty step to avoid falling, killing  her attempt at a follow up attack.</p><p>Stepping back as her  assailant righted herself, Ranma resumed the Heaven and Earth stance, awaiting  the other girl's next move.</p><p>With a disdainful snort,  Willow spun, black robes billowing open as she whipped her foot into a high  roundhouse. Ranma shot in, receiving the hit on her forearm as she took a step,  moving with the kicks motion and neutralising its power. Her arms then rose in  a sweeping circle, hooking the leg and capturing it against her hip.</p><p>Willow struggled to recover  her limb, but Ranma's grip held fast. With an angry snarl she jumped off of her  standing leg and swung her hips round, bringing the same foot smacking against  the redhead's cheek.</p><p>Recoiling from the  unexpected blow, Ranma stumbled to the side, her hand rising to cover her  smarting jaw. Pressing her advantage Willow moved, unleashing a flurry of  blows.</p><p>Taking three palm strikes to  the chest and one across her other cheek, Ranma grunted with the impacts as she  managed to raise her defences. Sensing the incoming open handed uppercut, she  sliced her hand down like a sword, her knife hand cutting into Willow's bicep.  Watching a wince flash across the girl's features, the pigtailed youth used the  distraction to slide out of range of her opponent's hands. She gritted her  teeth as her struck muscles protested, and she damned the weakness of this  cursed body.</p><p>Willow resumed her attack,  as Ranma braced herself to defend, returning to her stance. The Chinese girl  lashed out with a wild back hand, which Ranma easily avoided and captured,  dodging forwards and to the outside as her hand first parried and then clamped onto  Willow's wrist. Her other arm wrapped itself over her enemies shoulder,  cradling the side of her slim neck.</p><p>Ranma swept a step  backwards, moving with and absorbing the arcing momentum of the attack, then with  a sudden twist, reversed her direction, dropping to one knee as she returned  the stolen force. Pulling against the shoulder as she released the wrist and  tipped back the other fighter's jaw.</p><p>Whirled off of her feet  Willow was sent spinning to the pavement, a small cloud of dust kicking up as  she slid across the cobbles.</p><p>"Can we please talk this  through now?" Ranma asked, despising the weary quality that had appeared in her  voice.</p><p>Her response was a spitting,  searing noise, like the shrill whine of a firecracker as it shot into the sky.  Eyes wide the pigtailed girl looked on in horror as the pavement parted before  a wedge of dust filled air which sped across the ground, ploughing up fragments  of stone as it moved. The wedge slammed into her legs and swept them from under  her, sending her tumbling forwards.</p><p>She landed hard on crossed  forearms, grimacing as the impact jarred her bones. Glaring through her red  bangs, eyes narrowing; she watched her opponent rise to feet arms cradling her  side. Ranma followed suit, rubbing at her elbows as stood.</p><p>"I've got some tricks of my  own," the golden-haired girl said with a smirk.</p><p>"So I see." Ranma grunted.</p><p>" Can you." Willow lifted  her palm and swept it forwards. " Kyoufu Shou!"</p><p>The air between them warped  and twisted, small vertical ripples trailing behind the speeding charge of  compressed air like shockwaves. Raising her arms to form a cross, Ranma braced  herself. The projectile struck against her arms like a large barely visible  fist, jolting her frame as she stepped back to absorb the blow. The impact  stung her already bruised arms, but no more. Ranma frowned, <i>It's like the Kijin Raishu Dan,</i> he  thought, remembering the vacuum blade attack used by Ryu Kumon and invented by  his father. <i>She's using it bluntly  though. That's nice of her, </i>that thought was a bitter one.</p><p>Glancing for a second out of  the corner of her eyes, she noticed Ryoga's green eyes watching intently. <i>Probably looking for a technique to beat me  with, bastard. Wonder if he caught it? </i>Momentarily a frown creased her  face.<i> Doubtful, but even if he did it  wouldn't matter.</i></p><p>"It's not enough," she  bragged.</p><p>Her opponents just smiled.  "Maybe not, we'll see." Her hands came up again, and the air once again began  to shift. "Kyoufu Shou!" She threw another bolt of air with her left hand,  before she shooting her right out to launch another.</p><p>Instead of blocking Ranma  charged, hoping to close the distance and close into hand to hand. Unwilling as  she was to unleash her Moko Takabisha, her best hope was to encourage the  blonde to resume hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>The two air-shots tore threw  the air as they approached. Pushing hard on her left foot Ranma dodged to the  right, before leaping hard to the left, weaving between the two bolts as they  swept past. Yet behind the distorted air came Willow, lunging forwards in the  wake of her air bullets. Eyes widening Ranma's forearm flashed up, barely  managing to block the incoming fist.</p><p>The two girls crashed into each  other, the smaller redhead mown down by the larger frame of the blonde girl.  Yet she moved with the fall, dropping to her side as she took curled her fists  into the lapels of the China girl's robes. Slipping her foot between her  opponent's legs she dropped sideways, using her shin to push against the inner  thigh as she pulled sharply with her hands. Lifted from her feet Willow was  tossed over Ranma's head.</p><p>Rising to her feet Ranma  watched as the blonde projected herself into a break fall, rolling to her feet  with no harm. The young Saotome felt her lips twitch as she fought to withhold  a smirk in the face of the cold glare Willow aimed at him.</p><p>"This is getting old and  fast," she said in a flat monotone.</p><p>"Does that mean we can stop  this and talk?" Ranma asked hopefully.</p><p>"No," was the icy reply.</p><p>Ranma sighed, as the fight  resumed sinking back into Tenchi no Kamae Willow flashed forwards, hands both  striking out in a fast combination of attacks. Ranma easily evaded them,  strafing to the side as she knocked the hits away. The blonde shifted quickly,  spinning to the redhead's left and planting an elbow into her kidney. Ranma  winced, and tucked her elbows close in defence, but the other girl was already  in motion, coming from behind to land a swift trio of blows; a knife hand to  both the base of the head and the floating ribs, and a stomping kick to the  back of the knee.</p><p>Ranma dropped as her support  was weakened. Landing on her knee she kicked out with her another foot, making  a sharp stinging blow to her opponent's shin, before lunging into a roll,  forcing some distance between them.</p><p>Coming up standing she spun  quickly, growling in frustration as the girl continued her relentless  offensive. She snapped her forearm down to parry the open handed uppercut that  shovelled at her gut, moving diagonally forwards to avoid any follow up blows.  But her opponent came at her flank again. Ranma twisted pushing her arm to trap  Willow's before they could strike, but her knee caught him directly on the  nerve cluster of the thigh. Squawking as her leg numbed she slid back on her  other foot, sweeping around as the blonde tried to get at her back. Hampered by  her struck limb, she was forced to twist sinuously slipping and batting aside  the incoming palm strikes.</p><p>Conscious of the other  girl's tactics, Ranma was forced to move whenever Willow did, matching the  circling steps to avoid being struck from behind. Yet with pins and needles  shooting through her legs, such evasion was difficult. She was unable to match  as the blonde shifted, switching direction and slamming the heels of each palm  into Ranma belly and side. Grunting with the blows, she moved back hoping to  gain some space, as she was unwilling to strike back. Her lips twisted as she  moved, the perceived injustice penetrating through the haze of battle. <i>I won't hit her back, </i>she swore, her  eyes silently probing Willow's icy facade for any hint of her movements, any  opportunity for a joint lock or harmless throw, a peaceful technique. But there  was nothing.</p><p>Her arm snapped around  sharply to ward off a blow to the sweeping in towards his faced from the right.  <i>But with this numbed leg I can't keep up  this defence if she keeps spiralling around me.</i></p><p>Something in her mind  snapped in to place with a mentally audible click that resounded in her head.  The pieces of some puzzle she had not known about began to come together. <i>Final technique! Cold expression! Spiral  movement!</i>  Her eyes widened as more  clues presented them selves. As if the curtain had been lifted by her suspicions  she noticed the shifting of the air, sensing it growing denser and thicker. <i>Oh shit.</i></p><p>Time slowed as Willow  tightened the circle, Ranma watched her hand draw back and then rise into the  uppercut, the hand screwing through the air as it struck at the sky.She could feel the Ki charging the air  in the fist's wake. <i>OH SHIT!</i></p><p>"HOU'OU HANE SHIPPU!"</p><p>The winds rose, and an image  blazed in Ranma's mind. She saw a flash of white hair and cold, golden eyes.  Instinct did the rest.</p><p>" HIRYU SHOTEN HA!"</p><p>The sleeping dragon arose to  battle with the phoenix. The winds howled to life as the hurricane roared in to  life. Buffeted by wild, circular gusts she was lifted from her feet and sucked  into the rising vortex. Through the sounds that rushed in her ears, she heard  an intense scream and something slammed into her body.</p><p>Ranma grunted as she was  swept away into the current. Squinting through the dust and air that slammed  into her face, she saw Willow being tossed and blasted like a rag doll by the  harsh winds. The blonde was wailing as the wild tides carried her higher.</p><p>This was not the first time  Ranma had been caught in the Ki vortex. Drawing on that experience she let the  winds take her higher, gusts whipping her hair about her head and blasting her  face. She did not fight it, instead flowing with the violent air and kicking  with her feet to propel her upwards on the heels of her tumbling opponent.  Stretching out her hand she tried to get a handhold upon the spinning blonde,  but it was too late. With a loud scream Willow was ejected from the cyclone and  shot through the sky.</p><p>Grabbing hold of a nearby  rooftop, the young Saotome rode out the storm.</p><p>The air slowly calmed,  easing to a gentle breeze. She dropped from the house and straight into Ryoga's  fist.</p><p>"Ranma, you bastard, how  could you use a technique like that on a girl?"</p><p>Gasping around the lost boys  hand, she pushed him away wearily.</p><p>"Put a sock in it,  Bacon-breath." She grunted. " And help me look for her."</p><p>"Why should I help you," The  fanged boy spat.</p><p>"Well depends if you care  for your date?"</p><p>"SHE'S NOT MY DATE!" The  snapped reply was instantaneous.</p><p>Ranma sighed. "What ever  P-Chan. But I wouldn't hand around, the natives look pissed." She gestured with  a nod of her head towards a few numb villagers. They stood still as if  shell-shocked by the events they witnessed; yet the rising anger was evident in  their flushing faced and silent growls.</p><p>Limping on her still stunned  leg, she traipsed over to her pack. Her muscles ached and protested the motion;  she forced the sensations down with gritted teeth. She turned, towards the  horizon that Willow was last seen sailing over. Her hands clenched, knuckles  whitening. Ryoga was right; using such a techniques had been too excessive. But  she had gotten herself into this mess, and she would clean it up herself.</p><p>Akane gasped as she shot  awake. Bolting upright, she coughed and spluttered up a small deluge of icy  water. She shivered from the cold that was seeping into her and from the  white-hot rage that built inside. She growled low in her throat, the sound  building as she forced it out through her jaw as it shuddered from the cold.  Hands balling into her bedclothes, she shot her eyes towards the door, before  her brows lowered as she saw the figure standing there.</p><p>Genma Saotome's large frame  filled the doorway imposingly, the now empty bucket clanging as he let it fall  from his fingers. Akane drew breath to yell, only to have the words die in her  throat as the heavyset man threw something at her.</p><p>Her vision was veiled behind  white cloth. Jaw tightening she clawed the fabric from her face and glared at  hit, her jaw dropping as she recognised the item as her training gi.</p><p>"I'll be waiting in the  dojo, you've got ten minutes." Genma said gruffly before stomping out of the  room.</p><p>She sat there for several  moments, a haze of confusion clouding her thoughts. Then a steak of curiosity  lanced through her mind. She threw back the covers and leapt out of bed,  beginning to change as fast as her hands would work on her buttons, lips  twisting at the feeling of the wet fabric sliding across her skin. Then her  eyes caught on the curtains, and she flung them open. Her jaw dropped.</p><p>Twilight blue was still  washed across the sky, the colours slowly paling on the horizon. Amongst the  spires of the distant skyscrapers a growing halo of golden light crept upwards  slowly. A glance at her alarm clock confirmed her suspicions.</p><p>Dawn had come.</p><p>AN- I'll keep it short. It's  just a start, so not much to say. Just that I'd like to address those who  commented on my portrayal of Nodoka: You're absolutely right; I forgot how  ditzy she was. But the die is cast now; I guess I got to run with it. Hope  nobody minds. And thanks to those who reviewed the Mantis Saga, your words make  me want to write and happy that what I do is appreciated. So review this one  too!  Thanks to Rob and Bernie for  pre-reading.</p><p><b>Glossary-</b>  I'll start including a list for all the martial arts terms and special  techniques here. Mainly coz I don't want to index them all the time, so in the  future you can find the translations here. I'll also stick them in the End of  saga notes too. Hope it helps. And tell me if I start using to many, I don't  like using pointless Japanese (such as –sans and such) since I write in English,  but I think it's important for martial arts terms, but O don't want to go over  board. Also I'm not an expert in Japanese so some of the words (especially  those for made up techniques) may not translate exactly as given.</p><p><b>Tenchi no Kamae- </b>Posture  of Heaven and Earth, a defensive stance common in traditional Japanese martial  arts (budo) particularly in Jiu-jitsu and Ken-jitsu. Video game buffs may  recognise the stance from Virtual Fighter 4 as used by Aoi.</p><p><b>Bagua Zhang- </b>Eight  Trigram Palms.A real life Chinese internal martial art and the  inspiration for this saga. Called Hakkeshou in Japanese. I'll include more  details in the story and in the notes. I'll be using a mix if the actual fact  and poetic licence as I did for Mantis style, so hope I don't offend too many  practitioners of this style.</p><p><b>Kyoufu Shou- </b>Raging  Wind palm, a blunt blast of compressed air similar to a vacuum blade.</p><p><b>Hou'ou Hane Shippu- </b>Phoenix  wing gale, A summoned hurricane attack similar to the Hiryu Shoten Ha.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Beer-monster.</p><p>PS- Can my estranged beta  Wandering Oni give us a mail as I lost his address.</p><p>PPS- Um… this may be an odd  question. But do I have many girl/woman readers. Let me know. And would any of  you ladies like to be a pre-reader for me. You don't need expert grammar  talents, I've got that covered. However I will soon be writing more scenes from  the Ranma girls viewpoints (particularly Akane and Shampoo so big fans of them  would help), and being a dozy bloke I would appreciate some help with womanly  attitudes and thoughts and such, y'know help me get into their heads.</p><p>Warning, though you must be  open minded when it comes to pairing and a lot of stuff. Thanks.</p>
