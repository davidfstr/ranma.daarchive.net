</div><p><b><i>Honour And Pride</i></b><b></b></p><p>By Beer-Monster</p><p>Book II: The Eight Phases.</p><p><b>Chapter Three:  The Masters of The Mountain</b></p><p><i>Science without Religion is lame,</i></p><p><i>Religion without Science is blind.</i></p><p><i>                                                ~Einstein</i></p><p>The sun hung low, a golden blur  shining brightly through the grey wash the clouds painted across the sky. The  tall spires of Tokyo's hub stood like tiny sentinels in the distance, the  sprawling metropolis spreading to the ocean, which was barely visible as an  indigo band spanning beneath the dark clouds upon the horizon.</p><p>Shampoo crouched upon the rooftop  awaiting her prey. Perhaps some instinct born of Jusenkyo compelled her into  the posture of a prowling cat, her back curved into a feline arch as she  squatted on her haunches, the balls of her feet and the tips of her fingers  poised upon the tiles like a runner at the blocks. She peered carefully over  the edge of the roof, eyes scanning the streets and the skyline for any sign of  her quarry. Raising one hand she tucked a stray lock of lavender hair behind  ear, listening to the sound of the city.</p><p><i>Curse these Japanese for being so noisy, </i>she griped silently. She had once been proud of her tracking skills,  one of the best in her village she had honed her senses to human limits and  beyond, hunting wild game for her people in the valleys of her home in Quing  Hai. The thrill of pursuit was almost as sweet as the rush of combat and far  better for the soul. Harrying deer through the woods, trapping wild boars, her  sisters at her side and sharing the glory. No longer the young champion, but  one of a whole, the pack.  Dispatching  their target swiftly and painlessly with a single arrow, a hurled javelin and  occasionally her bare hands, the perfect test of the weapons she had honed her  body into.</p><p>There was no pleasure to be had in  the hunt while in Japan, the dense smog choking her lungs, the acrid scent of  factories and people clawing at her senses. The sounds were deafening, the  honking of cars, the revving of buses, the shuttling chant of the trains, and  the voices of thousands of thousands of people. Her senses were overloaded, her  quarry flitting unseen beneath the noise.</p><p>A scream pierced through the urban  din. Shampoo tensed and lowered her crouch, her body coiled, ready to strike.  From the corner of her eyes she saw a blur bounce across her periphery. She  pounced, her body unfurling and snapping straight, launching upwards like a  human arrow, her foot streaking at her target.</p><p>She hit nothing but air.</p><p>She recovered quickly from her  failed kick, whirling around with a snarl, arms immediately crossed defensively  across her chest.</p><p>"Morning Shampoo dear," came a thin  voice from behind her. "Starting early today aren't you?"</p><p>Shampoo turned quickly to face the  Anything-goes master, her arms still shielding her expansive bosom. Her grimace  grew deeper as her eyes came upon the bulging sack upon which the diminutive  old man was sitting, the strap and a single cup of a bright white bra  protruding from under the crudely tied knot. His eyes were sunken and squinted  amidst wrinkled, sagging skin, yet they still twinkled as they ran over her  leanly curved form. Shampoo growled and lunged forwards twisting into a low  roundhouse that cut the air like an iron flail.</p><p>Happosai dived to the side, leaping up and somersaulting over the  Amazon's vicious attack, carrying the black sack that dwarfed him in size  through the air like it weighed nothing.</p><p>Missing its target, the momentum of  Shampoo's kick spun her like a top. She pulled her leg back in, cocking her  heel beneath her and bringing herself into a controlled pirouette. Ending her  spin, she kept her leg raised as she faced the withered figure in the proud  crane stance, one arm outstretched and the other across her stomach, both hands  formed blades levelled at her enemy.</p><p>"Please be more careful Shampoo,"  Happosai chided softly. "That kick almost took away my silky darlings."</p><p>"They not yours, pervert man," she  spat. "You give back to people you steal from."</p><p>"I can't do that," he whined. "Those  girls, cute though they be, could never appreciate these lovelies like they  deserve." His gnarled face twisted in what she assumed was an attempt to look  cute.</p><p>"You give Shampoo panties now."</p><p>"Oh you want them, Shampoo?" A wide  suddenly split his shrivelled face from ear to ear. "Of course, anything for  you dear. I had worried about a sexy young thing like you having no panties of your  own. Yet now you wish to model lingerie for me." He wiped a crocodile tear from  his eye. "You make this poor, old man so happy."</p><p>"Happi keep dreaming," she roared as  she leapt into the air, arching her leg vertically into the air and bringing it  down into violent arc as she descended. The old man became a small black blur  as her heel slammed into the space he had just vacated, broken tiles erupting  from the impact.</p><p>Her vision went white, and then  black as something fell over her face. Staggering with surprise she fumbled to  the side, hands clawing at the fabric stretched over her eyes. With a growl she  ripped the material away, finding herself holding a pair of torn white panties.  Roaring loudly she shredded the garment with her nails, and flung away its  remains, her balance wavering at her toes encountered the roof's edge.</p><p>"Aw…that was a nice pair," the  withered master's voice whined from behind her, "but I'll forgive you"</p><p>Shampoo felt a pair of tiny hands  press against her behind, stubbly little fingers pinching and rubbing at the  firm flesh. With a muffled squawk she hopped forwards, jerking her hips  forwards and pulling her bottom out of the ancient pervert's reach, clasping  her hands protectively over her buttocks.</p><p>Her feet did not touch down on the  tiles; her indignant jump had vaulted her over the edge of the roof. She  dropped like a dead weight into the alley between the houses, plummeting with  her hands grasping at her ass, into the dumpster below. Half buried beneath  bulging plastic bags of trash, she screamed, reducing a soda-can to aluminium  foil in her fist as she watched Happosai leap across the alley, hefting his  sack of ill-gotten gains.</p><p>"See you around Shampoo my dear," he  called as he bounced away. "Say hello to your Granny for me."</p><p>Still snarling low in her throat she  wrestled her arms free of the heaving garbage and pulled herself upright. She  tossed aside the twisted remains of the can with as much force as she could  summon from her position, a small spike of satisfaction peaking as it pierced a  brick wall like an artillery shell. The moment soon passed, and she sighed  heavily as she gripped the lip of the dumpster and hauled herself out.</p><p>Her lips twisted as she furiously  tried to brush the dirt and stains from her silk blouse and pants grimacing, as  the result of her action was only to smear ketchup stains further into the  fabric. Suppressing the urge to slam her fists through the nearby walls, she  stomped out of the alley.  The few observer  who had seen the fight or where curious as to the noise scattered once her  expression came out of the alley's shadow. Shampoo pushed as much anger into  her reddish irises as she could, as if her gaze could reduce into ash, those  who had seen her shameful loss.</p><p>Shampoo stalked along the streets in  the direction of the Nekohanten, the current people before her parting like the  sea around the prow of a boat, some weaving carefully to avoid her while others  seeing the fury on her face simple leapt out of her path.</p><p><i>At least I have not become so weak that I cannot scare a few outsiders,  </i>she thought bitterly, and on the  heels that realisation came an even darker one. <i>Or perhaps I have become so weak that I've been reduced to scaring  weaklings, like some sort of bully.</i></p><p>A sweet scent wafted into her nostrils, the smell of freshly baked  pastries and other warm treats diffused in the air from the open door of the  local bakery. Shampoo's stomach twitched and emitted a burbling growl. Her eyes  were drawn to the shop's window, her eyes feasting upon the array of sweet  delicacies, from red bean wraps to western fondants. She could feel her mouth  fill with saliva as her nose and eyes devoured the displayed cakes.</p><p>Balling her fist, she jerked her  head aside forcing her gaze away from the bakery and back to the street before  her. She quickened her pace, marching ahead and turning the corner swiftly  moving towards the restaurant she still refused to acknowledge as home.</p><p>The restaurant was dim; the sun  having hidden behind the clouds now provided only meagre light reducing the  usually bright scarlet furnishings to a dull burgundy, and the white walls to a  pale grey. Like every morning the room was empty but for the young man who  leant over the tables, running a damp cloth over the lacquered tabletops. The only  sound was soft squeak of his scrubbing and the occasionally spurt of his  cleaning spray that filled the air with a bitter, citrus tang.</p><p>Mousse paused in his work, his  eyebrows drawing together as he wrinkled his nose. Shampoo scowled.</p><p>"Shampoo?" The male Amazon inquired,  lifting his head and blue eyes scanning vaguely around the restaurant.</p><p>"What Mousse want?" she spat.</p><p>He locked on to the sound of her  voice, and squinted in her direction. After a moment he started, head flinching  and eyes opening wide, his nose crinkled as he sniffed at the air once again.</p><p>"Why duck boy keep sniffling?" she  asked through grit teeth.</p><p>"Um….well….ah…." he absently  scratched at his temple with one finger and then at his nose, his gaze cast  downwards towards his shifting feet. "Well it's just that you smell so lovely  Shampoo, as always." His face was coloured by a flush that spread over his  cheeks. "I always like the way you smell, my love."</p><p>Shampoo snorted. <i>What a sycophant</i>, she thought, lips twisting with disgust. She knew full well how she  currently smelt, the scent of the dumpster clinging to her clothes and her  hair. Did the fool think she would respect him if he did not even have the guts  to tell her she stunk? She wondered if their time in Japan had affected his  Amazonian heart as well, or if he genuinely had no idea who she was.</p><p><i>Do <b>you</b> know who you are? </i>a small voice in her mind asked in reply to her thoughts.</p><p>She shook her head to banish the  voice and carried on through the restaurant, walking around two tables to avoid  crossing path's with Mousse. He had hardly latched on to her since Ranma's  departure, something she suspected her beloved had something to do with, yet  she did not want to tempt her bad luck, not even reeking of garbage as was.</p><p>"Table four short of chopsticks,  duck boy," she grunted over her shoulder.</p><p>"Got it," he replied, reaching into  his sleeves he withdrew a neat bundle of chopsticks and idly tossed them over  his shoulder without turning around. The wooden utensils remained in their  stack as if joined together, travelling through the air in a graceful arc.  Their trajectory landed them neatly in a tall metal tin upon the desired table  with barely a rattle, coming to rest amongst point down and in perfect order  with the other sticks in the tin.</p><p>Shampoo blinked and her lips  compressed to a fine line to prevent a gasp or any other sound from escaping. <i>That was good, </i>she thought yet continued to scowl at the young man as he continued  wiping down the tables, unwilling to allow her impression show. The throw had  been perfect, effortless; yet he had not turned to face his target and was not  wearing his glasses. He had made the shot based on his memory of the  Nekohanten's layout and instinct.</p><p>Despite her own skill at using forks  as projectile weapons, she knew she could not have performed a feat even whilst  aiming at the table. Watching almost blind martial artist do it without thought  forced her to acknowledge how far his talents had progressed.</p><p>Her hand had balled itself into a  fist, and was now clenched to hard that the knuckles had whitened as her hands  trembled by her sides. Feeling the room start to shrink she slapped at the door  of the kitchen, making the panel swing viciously upon its hinges and slam into  the wall besides. She stalked into the kitchen as the door slowly swung back,  vibrating rapidly with a low hum.</p><p>"Greeting Great-granddaughter,"  Cologne said looking up from a pan of boiling soup broth. She ran her gaze over  Shampoo's bedraggled form as twitched her nose as she slid her right eyebrow  slid up to the band of red leather that held back her cascade of ghostly hair,  making dark folds appear in her tanned, leathery face. "I see you've been  chasing after Happi again," she sighed.</p><p>"Old pervert say hi to great-grandmother,"  Shampoo muttered.</p><p>"How nice of him," the Amazon  matriarch said in an absent tone as she returned to her cooking, reaching into  the pot and stirring the broth with a long wooden spoon.</p><p>"I go take shower before customers  arrive."</p><p>Colognes nose crinkled again, "Yes I  think that would be a good idea." Her eyes rose to lock onto Shampoo's firmly,  creases comings at the corners of her eyelids as they narrowed. "Be quick  though, Shampoo. I must talk to you."</p><p>Shampoo repressed the urge to sigh,  and nodded. "Yes, Great-grandmother," she said in a polite voice and headed up  the stairs to the bathrooms, shedding her foul-smelling shirt on the way.</p><p>She gasped as the warm spray hit  her. Holding the hose over her head as she knelt in the tub and arched her  back, a small groan forming low in her throat as the hot waters washed over her  body. Grabbing a nearby loofa began rubbing the soap in to her skin, making  small circles firm muscles jarred and aching from her encounter with Happosai.  Suds slid across her smooth skins as she worked the soap in to her joints,  massaging deeply as the heat from the shower penetrated to her pores. Her eyes  fluttered closed and she groaned again.</p><p>When the sound of her own voice  reached her ears, her eyelids snapped open. <i>Yet another weakness,</i> the  inner voice taunted her. Once she had been blissful and content bathing in the  icy streams beside her home, her curse had taken that from her, and now she had  been bewitched by heated water and scented, herbal soaps. Her fist rose and  smacked down onto the rim of the bath stall, the blow obliterating the tiled  enamel. Looking at the results of her rage she sighed, her body deflating as  she slumped down onto her bottom. Mechanically she resumed washing, roughly  scrubbing her self piece-by-piece, then towelling dry and dressing with  systematic efficiency.</p><p>Dressing in a blouse of pale blue  silk with scarlet rim, and matching pants that ended with curves at her calves,  with slow robotic motions, she returned downstairs, running the long teeth of  an ivory comb through her lavender locks.</p><p>"You want to talk,  Great-grandmother," she called as she entered the kitchen. Cologne's gnarled  face popped up from a cupboard beneath the counter.</p><p>"Yes, Shampoo." She hopped on to the  table and began rifling through the shelves of spices that hung above. "Could  you make some tea for us dear, it'd be nice to take it easy before the first  customers arrive."</p><p>Shampoo scowled but dutifully  increased the heat beneath the kettle that was constantly on the stove, filling  a nearby teapot with richly scented green leaves. She grabbed two cups;  shallow, handless vessels with thin cracks marring the outside while the inner  surface were lined with pale rings from previous use. Taking the kettle off the  heat before it could fully boil she filled the pot, inhaling with some small  relish the sweet smell of Jasmine.</p><p>The Amazon matriarch leaped from  counter top and pogoed on her warty staff across the kitchen to a small pine  table beneath the window, hopping easily to one of the mismatched chairs,  waiting for her young descendant with her eyes cast through the pane of glass  into the clouded sky. Shampoo joined her promptly, laying a tray laden with the  teacups, pot and a couple of sweet biscuits onto the table, beside a thin vase  holding a wilting but still colourful iris.</p><p>Shampoo sat opposite Cologne, leaning over to poor tea first into her  elder's cup and then into her own. "What you want tell Shampoo, Great‑grandmother?"</p><p>Cologne glanced at her from the corner  of her eyes, "I only said I wished to talk with you, my dear," the old woman  said. She pivoted in her chair, moving away from the window and leaning over to  grab her cup, the leathery skin of her face puckering as she blew gently at the  steam wafting from her tea. "I believe that it is you, who have something to  tell me."</p><p>Shampoo swallowed. "What Great‑grandmother  mean?"</p><p>Cologne smirked wryly. "Don't play  stupid with me, young one, Granny knows better." Her gaze dropped from her heir  as she sipped at her tea, Shampoo almost sighed with relief. "Now child, tell  me why you have been chasing that annoyance Happi around town every morning,  without a care for your duties here or for your dignity as an Amazon." She  sighed as she set her cup down once again, "And please tell me why you have  been so insufferable to live with the past ten days?"</p><p>Shampoo squirmed in her seat,  suddenly feeling small, as she stared gloomily through the pale amber depths of  her tea.</p><p>"Look at me when I talk to you,  girl!" Cologne snapped, Shampoo's eyes darted up instantly. "I expected moping  for a time," the Matriarch continued. "Your beloved venturing out to test  himself, I can understand and forgive some small emotional turmoil."</p><p>"But Great‑grandmother…"</p><p>The ancient woman raised her voice,  cutting off Shampoo's weak protest as it crept from her throat. "However I had  hoped that as a warrior, you would understand Ranma's decision to seek new  challenges. I never thought that the young woman I had picked as the scion of  three thousand years of heritage, would stoop to a ten day temper tantrum like  some spoilt outsider girl."</p><p>Shampoo winced as those last three  words were driven into her like nails. "Perhaps that is the truth now."</p><p>"Would you care to elaborate on  that, Shampoo?" Cologne said in a dangerously soft voice, her tone like ancient  ice sliding on the mountainside.</p><p>Shampoo has not realised she had  spoken her thoughts aloud, her mouth opened and closed silently, brain  frantically scrambling for something to say, some excuse to fill the silence  and dissuade Cologne's falcon glare. Nothing came, and she was forced to snap  her jaw shut with an audible click.</p><p>Cologne's face softened, the creases  and folds off her aged skin fell from the furrow of her brow the dimples of her  cheek as she ventured a warm smile. "Tell me what troubles you, child," she  chided. "Remember the wisdom of the warrior Xin Da, '<i>The unwise fool tells all of her fears,  others will use them against her</i>…'"</p><p>" '<i>The stubborn fool tells no one,' "</i> Shampoo intoned from memory, picturing the worn, aged pages of the  books her mother and Great‑grandmother had read to her as a small child.  " '<i>She will use them against  herself.' </i>"</p><p>The smile on the old woman's face  grew as she nodded. "You learnt those words well, but I read doubt in you,  Shampoo. Why?"</p><p>Shampoo frowned, wondering whether  or not her Great-grandmother; Khu Lon, Matriarch of the Juketsuzoku, hailed as  the wisest and greatest warrior of the last seven generations, could possible  understand her worries. Her head was bowed low, but her eyes flicked up from  the ripples in her tea to glance at her revered relative through her purple  locks. She probed the old woman with a question of her own.</p><p>"Can love be weakness,  Great-grandmother?"</p><p>Cologne blinked, "I'm afraid you're  going to be more specific than that, Shampoo. It could be my old age but you  don't seem to be talking sense."</p><p>"That what other Elders in village  say. Say strong men are good for eyes, good for bed and sometimes good for  company. But no good for heart, make warrior weak."</p><p>Her Great-grandmother snorted with  contempt, "I taught you to respect the village Elders, but I also told you to  take all that they say with a whole crate of salt. My sisters have a tendency  to be stuck in their ways." She sighed and drained the remains of her tea.  "Perhaps you had best start from the beginning."</p><p>Shampoo leant across to refill the  Matriarch's cup, before settling back in her chair and gazing from the window.  Tilting her head upwards to pear above the high rising building that crowded  around the small restaurant, she watched the sun retreat behind the clouds, its  presence a radiant halo behind a shroud of murky grey.</p><p>"Few days ago Shampoo had been on  delivery, was not too busy to Shampoo take time come back to Nekohanten, walk  bike through town, and <i>window shop</i>." The last words had been forced out as a  muted hiss. Her hands gripped the table, the knuckles turning white. "See nice  dress, low cut in red with slit up leg, think make good for Airen when he  return. Young couple come to store window, look at same dress." Her lips  twisted into a scowl. "Girl was simpering fool, hang of mans arm like she have  no legs of own, smiling all time at man as if he were god in skin. She talk  about how pretty dress was, and ask man if he buy it her. When man say 'he not  sure', girl start crying, eyes going teary like turn on faucet. Finally man  give up, he see how much it cost and they go into shop." She remembered  watching with disappointment as a store clerk came and removed the scarlet  garment from the window, "Shampoo was disgusted." She had glanced at the girl,  her irritation swelling as she compared the other woman to herself, knowing  that she was far prettier and would look far sexier in that dress. With a sigh  she turned away unable to stop wondering wistfully if the lost outfit would  have been the one to get her beloveds attention, the one to make him see her as  beautiful. That was when it had hit her.</p><p>"That how Shampoo behave since meet  Ranma," she half cried half growled, her nails scoring the table as she balled  her hands into fists. "Every time he near by I act like girl, grabbing him,  hugging him, jumping up and down." She shook her head roughly. "That no how  Amazon warrior should act.</p><p>"When Shampoo think of Ai Ren, it  like proud Amazon dribble out and leave weak outsider girl." She frowned at the  table surface, ready to hear the matriarch scornful rebuke. She looked with  wide eyes up when all she heard was soft thump. Cologne had fallen from her  chair and now rolled upon the kitchen floor, seized by paroxysms of laughter,  her stunted, bony legs kicking at the air as she cackled.</p><p>"Great-grandmother," Shampoo cried,  scowling at the old woman.</p><p>"Child," she managed to squeeze  through her guffaws. "That is what men do," her laughter trailed off, and she  sighed as she pulled herself back into her seat. "The good ones anyway," she  added.</p><p>"So Elders right," Shampoo grunted.  "Fall in love with man is weakness."</p><p>Cologne frowned; leaning forwards to  peer into Shampoo's eyes with her narrow, wrinkled eyes. Shampoo shifted in her  seat. The ancient Amazon leant back into her seat and sipped from her tea,  peering into the cooling brew between sips as if reading the patterns formed by  the rippling surface. "Let me tell you a story, Shampoo." She set the cup down  and put her hands together, lacing her fingers.</p><p>"When I was a girl, not much older  than you are now, a man came to our village. He was a fascinating man, strong  and brash and cocky. Much like your Ai Ren in some ways," the wistful smile  dropped from her face twisting into a scowl. "The total opposite in many  others. That was the first man I ever loved, though at first I fought against  it, hoping that if I refused to he would not find a place in my heart, just as  the Elders taught." Cologne shook her head and exhaled in a slow rush.</p><p>"He wormed his way in and I fell for  him, hard. He left the village as an enemy, but I followed him, determined to  make him mine. Together we travelled through China and Asia, and it was bliss."</p><p>The matriarch went silent, her  litany paused with a tangible quiet and the old woman twisted her cup in her  gnarled fingers, watching the golden fluid spin. "I should have known he would  betray me, that was who he was. But I had blinded myself to his many faults, so  in love was I. When the day came, I was devastated. I dared not go back to the  village in my shame, and so wandered through China carrying the shards of my  broken heart. Wondering what I had done wrong."</p><p>"You no do anything wrong  Great-grandmother, it stupid man's fault, you should have kill for betraying  you."</p><p>Cologne gave a shrug of her bony  shoulders, "Maybe, Shampoo, but maybe not. Sure it was his fault, but as I was  soon to learn I was not guiltless."</p><p>"What happen?"</p><p>"Well as I said, I was travelling  through our homeland. Many martial artists were in those days; the nobility has  split in to many clans who used the Art to strengthen the family. Many  mysterious artefacts were scattered throughout the country, and new styles were  springing from the hands of the masters. It was impossible for any martial  artist to travel without being challenged by some warrior looking to test  themselves, and as I tasted defeat after defeat I learned what I had done  wrong."</p><p>"Defeat," Shampoo gasped, the  concept was something that she had never associated with her revered relative,  a living legend of fighting prowess. It was like being told the sky was green  or that the monkey sage was just a story.</p><p>"Yes, child, I once had to learn  from my defeats in battle just as young Ranma is learning to. However at the  time I was convinced as you are now that everything I had learnt in the village  about love and men was true. My time with my first love had made weak, the  comforts of the outside world though much harder than the life of today was  still easy compared to the harsh life of training and working as I had done  back home. My skills had faded and fighters who would have once been a trifle  defeated me, and I was sure it was all, that man's fault. So I began training  harder than I had ever done before, challenging all who I encountered,  determined to regain my strength and never let anyone take it from me again."</p><p>Shampoo found herself nodding as her  Great-grandmother spoke, her own feelings stirring like a modern echo of the  Elders tale. She recalled a long, hard battle with the Okonomiyaki chef,  fighting for the attentions of an amorous Ranma bewitched by a magical  band-aid. They had exchanged blows from morning until the afternoon on a hot summers  day, fists and feet against spatulas large and small, neither of them winning  until Shampoo had seized on her opponents distraction and trapped Ukyo with a  volley of thrown forks. Yet the young Amazon knew that she should have easily  beaten the other woman, her strength, breeding and training were far superior  but her abilities had dulled. She had watched the many warriors of Nerima grow  stronger, her beloved and his rival the pig-boy Ryoga had both progressed by  great strides, while she grew weaker. Even Mousse's talents had ripened, and  Shampoo felt black fear creep into her heart as she thought of the blind boy  again challenging her for her hand. Her hands tightened against the table as  she fought back a shudder.</p><p>"I was wrong back then, Shampoo.  Maybe not completely but still very wrong." Shampoo blinked and then her brow  furrowed at the Colognes words, but she said nothing and waiting for the other  woman to continue. "I didn't learn my error until I met a Korean warrior called  Hwang Siu Kim." The old woman cackled. "Oh that man handsome, even more so than  son-in-law." Shampoo scowled; that could not be possible. "We fought many times  though he was not quite my match. He was smitten by me, I was quite the beauty  back then so I can't blame him." Shampoo rolled her eyes at the boast and  Cologne chuckled, a sound like breaking leaves. "Events conspired to bring us  together time and time again, but I refused to fall for his charms, determined  not to let another man make me weak as before."</p><p>Again Cologne sighed, and smiled  towards Shampoo. "Love is very much like the ocean tide, eventually even the  most stubborn rock gets worn away. So it was with my apathy towards him, and I  fell in love for the second time. We spent many happy years together after  that, and then I knew why it had all fallen apart the first time."</p><p>"Why, Great-grandmother?"</p><p>Cologne smirked enigmatically. "Is  it not obvious, dear. It is the same reason Mousse has yet to capture your  affections."</p><p>Shampoo grimaced; lips twisting as  if she had eaten something fowl. "Surely you not compare self to stupid  duck-boy, Great-grandmother."</p><p>"I'm don't relish the idea myself  either," Cologne said wryly. "However the comparison stands. When Mousse fell  in love for you, he devoted himself to you and tried to become the kind of man  he thought you would love." The old woman's eyes flicked at the door to the  restaurant where the boy in question continued to work. "It has gone so far  that no one, not even Mousse himself even knows what sort of man he was or was  capable of being. He tried too hard, as did I back then. Do you see what I'm  trying to say, Shampoo?"</p><p>Shampoo remained silent turning her  gaze away from the withered woman and studied the fine cracks and flakes that  ran through the paint upon the window frame.</p><p>Cologne tutted and sighed. "You see,  Shampoo, this weakness that men and love can bring is not their fault but our  own. We allow ourselves to change, get caught up the whirlwind of first romance  and we lose touch of ourselves. Feelings change us that much is inevitable, our  surrounding alters us and that too cannot be stopped. However, whether the  change is for good or for ill is the question. I tried to become what I thought  that man wanted most so that he would not betray me. In the end I made it  easier to do so by changing from the person who he had been attracted to. The  second time it was an affair of equals, I remained myself as did he and we  loved each dearly for it."</p><p>"So you say Shampoo try too hard to  win Ranma love?"</p><p>Cologne smiled and shook her head.  "I merely told a story that I thought may provide some insight, the heart of  the matter is what to you think, Shampoo?"</p><p>Shampoo frowned. She let her  Great-grandmother's wisdom form a filter for her thoughts. She poured her  worries and fears through the revelation like light into a prism, sifting  through the spectrum of ideas that emerged. Did she try to hard? Was on the  same path as Mousse? She knew he did not trust her, was her ardour just pushing  Ranma away? Perhaps that was the problem, did she care too much about Ranma's  opinion of her? The questions swarmed and multiplied, overloading her thought.</p><p>"Shampoo no know what think?" she  admitted in a low grumble.</p><p>"There's nothing wrong with that,  child. No doubt I have given you too much food for thought to ingest in one  sitting." Taking up her cup, she sipped away the last drops of tea. "Though  perhaps you should consider another thing. Although this separation from your  Ai ren is very painful, it may present an opportunity to assess the affects of  your love for him, and the changes it might cause. A chance to determine who  you are, who you want to be, and then maybe went you know this consider what  son-in-law may want." She paused for a moment before adding a dry, "though I  doubt he knows for himself."</p><p>Shampoo let those words sink in. Who  was she, what did she want? An Amazon warrior, she hoped. That is all she had  ever wanted to be, the best in her tribe for her tribe, and the best she could  be for herself. What did Ranma want? To be the best he could be? A smirk  crossed her lips; that was why she loved him, and maybe that would be why he  would love her? She thought of all the times she had clung to him, only to be  pushed aside, and of the battles they had fought together, side by side.</p><p>She rose to her feet, reaching over  to once more fill her Great-grandmother's cup. The tea was cold now, but that  did not matter, it would fit her designs. Holding the cup gently in both hands,  careful not to spill a single drop she walked around the table, now standing  before the small but powerful presence of the matriarch. The old woman said  nothing, just sat in her chair with her tiny legs crossed watching the young  Amazon like a hawk with her large, grey eyes.</p><p>Lowering herself to her knees, the  hard tiles of the kitchen floor biting at her bones, she rose the cup before  the Cologne with both hands. She bowed her head low, unable to see the ancient  warrioress through a veil of lavender hair.</p><p>"Honoured Elder, one who is in  search of knowledge and strength humbly asks for your teachings."</p><p>Cologne smiled warmly, the gesture  restoring some youth to her wrinkled face as it shone with affection. "Shampoo  my dear, you never needed to ask." With a light touch she took the offered cup,  and brought it to her lips for a dainty sip.</p><p>Shampoo could not stop her self from  grinning in reply. <i>Ranma has  proven himself worthy of my love many times since he defeated me. Perhaps it is  time I made myself worthy to share his path and his heart?</i></p><p>Rain and dew clung to the bare and  sodden branches, each fluid sphere shimmering slightly as the wind whistled  through the boughs, before they finally succumbed and toppled in a glistening  arc to the moist ground. Pearly droplets glistening on the fine strands of a  spiders web making the arachnid silk appears as hair thin threads of liquid  light as they played with the wan glow of the grey sky.</p><p>Ranma grimaced as he ducked beneath  the web, the sight of its captured water made him glance anxiously at the dark  clouds overhead, a prayer to hold on to his natural form floated silently on a  puff of tensely exhaled air. He heard Ryoga snort from behind him as he slashed  his umbrella through the air lazily, sending the spider's silk scattering with  a tiny shower of released moisture.</p><p>"Get a move on, Ranma," his  companion grunted weaving around the trunk of a slanting ash tree to trudge  ahead.</p><p>"Just giving you a chance to keep up  Ryoga, I got to keep an eye on you or you'll be trekking through the desert and  asking camels for directions."</p><p>Ryoga snorted, looking back of his  shoulder with a scowl his fangs bared. "At least I'd be away from you jerk," he  grumbled and continued walking. Ranma followed swiftly, sliding around the  tightly knit trees as he moved closer to the lost boy.</p><p>"That way I wouldn't be forced to wade through this damned forest  because <i>someone</i> managed to alienate us from the town by  beating up a girl, so now we can't even take the pathway up the mountain."  Ryoga continued, the volume of his voice ramping until he was roaring the last  sentence.</p><p>"Like you could keep to the road,"  Ranma muttered under his breath before replying in a louder tone. "Just let it  go, Ryoga. We have to find that girl." He scowled at the bare but dense winters  forest, striking out with a blurred knife hand at a branch in his path, severed  twigs falling to ground like severed fingers. "Are you sure she didn't give you  anymore details about where she lived?"</p><p>Ryoga half-sighed, half-growled.  "For the two-hundredth time, NO!" Ranma was now close enough to see the other  boy's hazel eyes roll beneath his mop of thick, black hair. "All she said was  that she lived somewhere on the mountain, she and her family are some sort of  scholars."</p><p>"Which is all well and good but its  doesn't make finding her any easier." Ranma bit back a few curses and scowled,  tilting his head to glare at the mist shrouded peak of Emei that towered above  them.</p><p>"I don't know why you are so  determined to find her, don't you think you've done enough," Ryoga said,  frowning at him from the corner of his eyes. "I mean you did beat her up, a  girl no less." The bandana-clad youth's jaw tighten, the sharp, white tip of a  fang just visible against his lips as his mouth worked.</p><p>Ranma could not blame Ryoga for his  anger, he his own swell in his chest and all of it for himself. Nevertheless he  shot some it upon his rival, growling out his rebuke.</p><p>"She started it Ryoga, and you  encouraged her."</p><p>"Feh," Ryoga spat dismissively, "You  deserved it, Ranma, and it was you not I who launched her into the sky."</p><p>Ranma's hands tightened on the strap  of his pack, trembling as he squeezed the material in his fist. Ryoga was  right; he admitted silently, stomach twisting at the thought. The Hiryu Shoten  Ha had been too much. His bile rose in his throat as he recalled the girl's  panicked, frightened face as she was sucked into the whirlwind. He grimaced,  his brow knitting as he cast his mind back to the fight. The girl had also  known the technique, somehow, and was going to use it against him. What he had  done he had done in self-defence.</p><p>That was the crux of the dilemma. His father had told him that girls  were weaker than boys, but he had also taught him to defend himself from attack  and that the heart of the Anything-goes school lay in answering all challenges.  He tried to avoid fighting women, but like everything else in life sometimes  the fights were unavoidable. He had always given them less than what he knew  they could handle, emphasising his victory with boasts and posturing. Making it  all seem so easy to him that they knew he had beaten them; just as it had been  with Shampoo, another battle that had come back to bite him in the butt.</p><p>He could not avoid the fight with the Amazon, he had eaten what should  have been her prize and the only way to make it right was to earn the reward  for his self. He had watched the girl fight her previous opponent, knew she was  a skilled warrior. A prolonged battle would only waste their time and force him  to hurt her. So he had posed with insulting disregard, not even bothering to  take a fighting stance. When Shampoo had charged he saw the weak spot and  attacked it with forced lethargy. Sweeping the Amazon's leg from under her and  sending her flying from the log, deliberately following through with his leg  until it rose above his head, displaying his flexibility to show how easy it  had been. In reflection he found it easy to understand why Shampoo gave her the  Kiss of Death, and wondered if things may have been different, his life easier  and his heart less burdened by her eventual affections if he had been less  mocking.</p><p>Ryoga had continued in his lecture, his words touching on a similar  subject as Ranma's own thoughts.</p><p>"You had to go and insult her Ranma, no wonder she attacked you. Just  like with Akane, you have to mouth off, and instead of taking your lumps like a  man, you use a violent move like the Hiryu Shoten Ha…"</p><p>Again the lost boy was right. Ranma scowled, detesting Ryoga's new  insights. Maybe it was just like with Akane, the scenario did seem achingly  familiar. In his anger at Ryoga for leaving him in the middle of the forest he  had tried to embarrass him in front of the girl who hung rather close at his  side. Knowing the how easily the other youth lost all decorum around girls he  had thought it would be easy, but a offhand remark about the colour of the  young woman's hair had inflamed her, just like a negligent comment about  Akane's cooking or her martial arts would earn him a trip through the Tokyo  sky. Then the girl had insulted her, and things had plummeted from there, until  she had finally attacked, refusing to listen to his weak protests against the  fight that arose as his pride gave way to his sense.</p><p>The difference was that this girl was good, better than Akane or  Shampoo, better than any girl he had ever fought. He had tried dodging and  blocking but her unusual style came at him from all sides, wearing away at his  guard and penetrating his defences, forcing him to counter attack. Still he tried  to limit himself, using only passive techniques; redirection, throws and weak  low kicks. It was not enough; so he slowly increased his force, which only  served to increase her assault, unleashing powerful Ki attacks.</p><p>Then came the Rising Dragon Wind. Ranma sighed and again stared at the  mountain ahead, the fogs that swarmed around its top blurring its outline  making it appear like the washed scene of a watercolour painting.  Was it right to use it? Willow had attempted  it on him, but surely he could have thought of a better way to defend, a kick,  a punch. He did not like the idea but it was better than dragging her unto the  vortex to be spat out in to the distance and probably sent crashing through any  number of branches before slamming into the ground. His stomach tried to tie  itself in knots as the image of such a landing plagued his mind. Sure the  blonde had known the techniques but was obviously unprepared to be caught in it  her self. Could she take it?</p><p>Ranma sighed, despite his pledge to become a honourable man he had  acted just like the jerk he had always been. His hand trailed across the silken  fabric of his red shirt over his stomach, almost feeling his mother's  disapproval at his actions. Ryoga said he should have taken his lumps like a  man, well there was no way he was just going to stand there and let a girl he  didn't know hit him (he'd had enough of that from living with Akane), but  perhaps he should have simply taken her insults and let them wash over him.  Instead he launched his own barbs and started a fight, and why because the  girls had insulted his beauty, had mocked the looks of a <i>curse.</i> His vanity left a bitter taste in his mouth.</p><p>"Ranma," Ryoga snapped, stopping ahead and glaring daggers at him  yanking his thoughts away. "Where are your usual excuses? Say something for  yourself." The other boy revealed a single fang as his lips curled into a  smirk. "Or am I finally witnessing Ranma Saotome take responsibility and feel  guilty for being a jerk?"</p><p>"Shut your face, Ryoga," Ranma barked, pushing his rival aside roughly  as he continued ahead. "We have to find her." <i>I may not have been able to stop myself screwing things up, but this  time I will make up for it </i>he  promised.</p><p>"Don't shove me, Ranma," Ryoga roared.</p><p>Ranma spun twisting to avoid the lunge he knew was coming, as he dodged  the fanged youths attack he felt goose bumps tingle upon his skin, and this was  not coming from Ryoga.</p><p>"Shut up, idiot" he hissed, wrapping an arm around the larger boy's  waist he spun, clipping Ryoga's legs with his heel and projecting them both  into the bristling bushes that choked the roots of the nearby trees. He heard a  feral growl and felt Ryoga's knuckles dig into his ribs causing him to grunt.  Ranma shifted his weight on top the lost one, pinning both of Ryoga's arms down  across his chest and wrapping both legs around his hips, using his legs to hook  the other fighter's shin and lift his feet from the ground, preventing him from  gaining any leverage. He could already feel Ryoga start to squirm free, trying  to slide his hips from beneath Ranma's weight. Using his elbows to press into  the lost boy's sternum, he heard his rival's muted cry as the sharp bones poked  sharply downwards. Hoping he could suppress the Hibiki's monstrous strength for  a little longer he lifted his head to look into the other boys furious eyes,  trying to speak urgently without words. Ryoga writhed like a caged beast,  spittle frothing from his fangs as he snarled. Risking his defence, Ranma  lifted a finger to his lips.</p><p>"Trust me," he whispered.</p><p>Ryoga's mouth opened for a rebuke, but remained silent as the sound of  voices floated to them on the breeze. Mossy green-brown eyes met the blue-grey  of the morning sky, and the bandana-clad youth stopped his struggling. He  inhaled long and deep through his nose, filling his lungs as his teeth  clenched, and with a visible effort he nodded shortly.</p><p>With a sigh Ranma rolled to the side, suppressing a wince as thorns  tore at his exposed skin, setting onto the wet ground he listened and watched  through barbed brambles and stalks of grass.</p><p>A thrashing sound grew louder, reaching an apex as two men came  crashing at a run through the brush, emerging into a clearing that had been  several paces ahead on Ranma and Ryoga's previous pass. Three other men joined them  from the opposite direction, melting out of the shadows of the tightly knit  trees. They were all dressed in loose, blue habits. The folds were held back by  sashes of braided leather, wrapped around their waist so that the robes hung  like a azure tail down the back of their legs. They wore baggy trousers of a  course brown fabric, tied around at the ankles above the thick black wrappings  that covered their feet, stained with the dirt of their travel.</p><p>The only other common factor  between the five was the movements, their posture and steps holding fluid grace  of trained warriors.</p><p>The newcomers glanced around the clearing and then the five men began  chattering in Chinese, punctuating their words with wild hand gestures at each  other and at the surrounding forest.</p><p>"What are they on about?" Ranma asked Ryoga softly.</p><p>"They're some sort of guards, and they've been looking for us," Ryoga  grumbled. "Or at least they've been looking for a 'interloper' said to be  travelling with a 'foul and offensive redheaded girl'" he shot a pointed glare  at Ranma. "This is all your fault."</p><p>Ranma sighed, "Think of a new line and shut up, moron," he grunted.</p><p>A cry rose from the men, one of the  men, a short, wiry figure with a straggled plait of dark hair scrambled into  the trees waving his arms at the object that lay slumped in the grass. Ryoga's  pack, its pockets bulging, remained where he had discarded it before attacking  the Saotome heir. Ranma winced as he saw his own bag protruding from the  tangled growth of long grass, thistles and tree roots where it had landed when  he had flung it aside to dive into the bushes with the lost boy.</p><p>"They'll wait by the bag in case we come back," he guessed. "We'll have  to take them on." Despite the reluctance in his tone, Ranma could not fight the  smirk that slipped on to his face.</p><p>The other men joined the small one, who had pulled the bag upright,  moist blades of grass falling from it as it moved. His rat-like face screwed  into a frown and he wrapped his hand the handle of the ribbed, red umbrella  that was strapped to the packs top. With a few yanks the weapon came free, and  both it and the man dropped sharply to the floor with a wet thump. Grumbling  what seemed to be curses, he began pulling at the umbrella. The sleeves of his  robes had ridden up to reveal the bunching muscles of his forearms as he tried  to lift the formidable weight, his torso jerking as he brought more of his body  behind the effort. The umbrella lifted a few inches before plummeting to the  ground again, deepening the impression of crushed grass and squashed mud it had  made.</p><p>He yelled at his companions, still scowling at the umbrella as he  stepped away.</p><p>The largest man chuckled and strode over to the items, the swelling of  his broad chest noticeable even through his the folds of his habit. He  scratched at his tight curls of dark hair, before stopping to grasp the  umbrella's handle. After an unsuccessful attempt to lift it using single hand,  he seized it in two fists and yanked it up with a strong heave. He staggered  back a few steps as the weight shifted in his grasp. Widening his stance and  bending his knees the broad fighter hefted the weapon experimentally, waving it  in small circles with first two hands then just one, the motion of the single  hand jerky and strained. After a while he examined the umbrella's broad blunt  tip and then after a stiff nod he began to swipe and slash at the air, his  knees bending and shifting and feet digging into the dirt as he treated the  umbrella like the club he had guessed it to be. Twisting over his shoulder he  chuckled something to his friends, who shrugged.</p><p>Ranma heard a low growl and then a snap, Ryoga's fangs were bared and  the mangled remains of several fell from his shaking fists. He pounded his fist  into the ground hard enough for Ranma to feel the tremor, and used it to surge  upwards. The lost boy tore through the sticks and thorns of the bush, seizing  the debris in his way and tearing it aside and he stood up strode forwards, the  sounds of tearing fabric just audible above the noise of the ripped and crushed  vegetation.</p><p>With as much as a shrug as he could manage in his prone position, Ranma  crawled quietly from beneath the concealing shrubs and following behind,  patting and brushing at the leaves and smudges on his shirt and pants.</p><p>Ryoga stalked towards the men who watched his approach with narrowed  eyes, their feet shifting on the grass as their bodies tensed and their hands  rose with palms outwards into a wary guard. The lost boy took no notice,  marching towards the larger man with a dark scowl, his heels thumped against  the ground with every step and his shoulders heaved as his rolled his fingers  into fists, knuckles cracking. The guard watched him approach, holding the  umbrella out before him with both hands like a sword.</p><p>The gesture made the bandana‑clad youths eyes narrow and as soon  as he was close enough he tore the weapon from the man's huge hands with a  fierce yank, snarling something in fluent Chinese. Ryoga's opponent replied  with a cocky sneer, which dropped into grimace, at the lost one's short  comeback, the muscles in his angular jaw swelling.</p><p>The man's great shoulders quivered as he glared as if to reduce the  Japanese boy to dust with his eyes, he bit out a few short words through grit  teeth. Ranma saw the other youth shrug and step back with a smirk, propping the  umbrella on his right shoulder as he lifted his left hand and crooked his four  fingers in a beckoning gesture.</p><p>Ranma shrugged and buried his hands in his pockets as the large man  threw himself forwards with a roar. <i>Ryoga  can handle it, </i>he thought as the  lost boy stepped to the outside, swinging the umbrella in a small circle to bat  aside the palm strike that shot at his face. Twisting his arm at the elbow he  clubbed the attacker across the back, the tip of the weapon whipping into the  kidney. The man growled in pain and stumbled forwards, one arm bent behind him  to clutch at his spine while the other nursed the bruised organ. <i>Besides, it's not often I get to watch as a  third person, </i>Ranma thought wryly,  eyes trained on his rival's every move and mind comparing each action to their  previous bouts.</p><p>A second fighter gave a shout and charged from behind. Ryoga's eyes  darted, glancing from the corner of his eyes as he spun the umbrella in his  hand, reversing his grip on the handle. With a step backwards Ryoga intercepted  his new attacker with his back still turned. He swung his arm back, elbow  turning to thrust the umbrella back beneath his armpit and into the man's  sternum, knocking him off his feet with a hard gasp of expelled air.</p><p>The first attacker had recovered and came at Ryoga again, lunging low  with arms like pincers for the tackle. Ranma's eyebrows flew upwards as he  watched the lost one throw his umbrella forwards with a flick of his wrist,  sending the bamboo weapon spinning through the air so as the blunted point  arced upward it caught the large fighter square on the chin like an uppercut  fist. The man reeled and Ranma's jaw dropped as he watched Ryoga shoot  forwards, and slam the butt of the still falling umbrella precisely so that it  would fly forwards into his opponents nose. The blow whipped the man's face  around, and Ryoga grabbed the umbrella as it recoiled from the strike at with a  flourish, brought it round in an arc to slam into the top of his foe's battered  head. The man crumpled to the floor, out before he hit the dirt.</p><p>The small man with the ragged braid  came in from the left, sweeping the folds of his robes back as he swung his  foot around in a vicious arc at Ryoga's head. The youth dropped into a crouch,  folding on leg across the ground in front of him as he sat on his haunches and  bowed his head, slashing into the shin of the rat like man's supporting leg and  ploughing the limb from beneath him. He hit the floor hard enough to make his  head bounce, even in the soft mud. His weak cry became a loud squawk of pain as  Ryoga stepping on his back, planting his heel in between the shoulder blade and  pressing him further into the dirt as the lost boy made a fencer's lunge,  poking the returning second attacker in his already abused chest and stopping  his rush.</p><p>The small man squealed again as  Ryoga pushed off from his back to hop forwards and thrust his foot into the  second man's gut. The kick folded the assailant around his leg. The man bent  double with a straggled groan as the fanged youth retracted his foot, and  brought the pommel of his umbrella down like a hammer upon the exposed base of  his opponent's skull. The man slumped forwards into unconsciousness but Ryoga  seized the collar of his robes in his spare fist and flung him into the path of  a fourth attacker.</p><p>At this moment the fifth guard, a  tall rangy figure with a pointed beard and unruly brown hair took notice of  Ranma's presence and leapt forwards with his right hand outstretched, seizing a  fistful of Ranma's shirt at his left shoulder. With a tired sigh the pigtailed  boy slipped to the inside just as the man's fingers curled around the silken  fabric. Pulling his hands from his pocket he reached under the man's grip with  his right seizing the offending arm at the crease of the elbow and pressing  firmly on a nerve cluster with his fingers. His opponent yelped and tried to  pull away but Ranma's left hand had seized the fist that gripped his shirt.  Pulling sharply with his right hand, Ranma forced the man's arm to bend while  pushing the limb captured in his left in an arc over and towards the man's  back. The attacker cried out as his arm was twisted the wrong way. His elbow  was now in front of his face and his hand behind him and being pushed towards the  small of his back. Ranma's stepped in close and propped the back of the man's  arching shoulder against the top of his own, earning a loud yell by his ear as  his foe protested the twisting of his joints, the shoulder being held on the  verge of popping from its place.</p><p>Ranma turned back to the fight, the  bearded man hissed at the movement, so he pulled down gently on the wrist in  his hands, applying more pressure to the locked joint and ceasing the man's  struggles immediately.</p><p>Ryoga was now defending against the  fourth attacker who had dumped his unconscious comrade to the side and resumed  his assault. He was more skilled than his fellows, managing to avoid the  umbrella swipe at his head and the downward slash that followed. As Ryoga  jabbed with the bamboo club and then spun full circle to lash out with his  heel, Ranma noticed the skinny guard gather himself from the ground.</p><p>He released the bearded man from the  lock by straightening the captured arm without breaking it. As expected the man  jerked backwards in a desperate attempt to escape, but Ranma stepped in to him  as he pulled and spun around. Drawn into the sudden twist by his still held  hand, the guard was tossed over the leg that Ranma had left outstretched and  was dropped hard into the mud by a jerk of the braided youth's shoulder. As  soon as he had the opponent on the ground Ranma punched him swift and light  between the eyes, knocking him out, before turning to see if Ryoga had noticed  the small man's recovery.</p><p>He apparently had because as the  rat-like warrior picked himself up and began walking slowly and warily towards  the lost boy's back, he was sent crashing down again as Ryoga flung the  umbrella absently over his shoulder, the brolly turned javelin struck the wiry  figure in the centre of his forehead and floored him.</p><p>Free of the umbrella's weight Ryoga  sped up his hand to hand, swinging his fist in two mighty roundhouses that the  fourth man just barely dodged, and followed with a powerful kick that his  opponent blocked on crossed forearms but was still bowled from his feet by the  blow's force. Ryoga leapt high into the air and descended with a punch. The  guard just managed to roll aside as the lost boy's fist cratered into ed the  earth where his chest had been, springing back up and slamming two palm strikes  into Ryoga's face.</p><p>The boy blinked at the impacts and  then bore his fangs in a wide grin. The man's mouth fell open and his eyes  widened, barely managing to stop gawping as Ryoga launched a fist at his head.  Ranma frowned, his brow knitting together as he watched the man weave around  his rival's attack with a familiar swinging, circling step that set his hairs  on end.</p><p>The guard twisted into a kick,  whipping his leg into Ryoga's chest. The lost boy barely grunted, but a wince  twisted the man's face and as he brought his foot back he limped slightly,  grimacing as his weight shifted to the tender limp. In his attackers moment of  weakness Ryoga swung a wild backhand, his fist crashing into the fighters jaw  like a mace and sent him flying against a tree trunk and slumping to the  ground.</p><p>Ryoga twisted his neck, glaring  across the clearing for another opponent, as his green eyes locked on to Ranma  his lips twisted. "Don't butt into my fights, Ranma," he growled eyebrow  quirking at the man laid motionless at the pigtailed boy's feet.  "I don't need your help!"</p><p>"He came for me." Ranma shrugged,  walking across the clearing to where Ryoga had bent to recover his umbrella  from beside the smaller fighter's form. "Went a bit overboard don't you think?"  he asked sweeping his gaze across the clearing, frowning at the large man's  bloodied face and the tree now standing crooked with a patch of bark stripped  by the fourth man's impact.</p><p>"You're not the only one who can  drag a fight out for fun," Ryoga said in a low tone. "Besides, I like this  umbrella."</p><p>Ranma regarded the weapon of waxed  red fabric and bamboo ribs as the lost boy hefted it over his shoulder, "You've  never said where you got the damn thing anyway." He was sure that such  umbrella's could not be found at festival stalls.</p><p>Ryoga turned to face him, eyes  seeming to gaze through him. Then those hazel irises became shimmering and  distant and he ducked his head, staring at the ground. "Hong Kong," he grunted  after a while.</p><p>"I should have known," a new voice  said through the rich chuckles that rang through the clearing. "Only you could  cause so much trouble, Ranma."</p><p>The two martial artists whirled  towards the source of the words, Ryoga brandishing his umbrella defensively,  while Ranma's body tensed his hands rolling into fist as he watched the  newcomer approach through narrowed eyes.</p><p>Sunlight glinted of the round lenses  of the man's glasses as he pushed them further up the bridge of his nose with  his fingers, and his face was lit by a gentle smile that Ranma had not seen in  what suddenly seemed to be centuries.</p><p>"Dr Tofu?"</p><p>Ling Ling sighed as her sister  crawled along the rocks frowning at the ground.</p><p>"Are you sure it  came this way, Lung Lung?"</p><p>"It's a mountain lion isn't it?" the  green-haired girl snapped in retort. "And the tracks lead the way."</p><p>"So now you're looking for even more  foot prints in stone?"</p><p>Lung Lung jerked and snarled back  "Just carrying on looking and let me worry about that?"</p><p>"Fine, fine sorry to interrupt." Ling  Ling said, holding her hands up in a calming gesture." She returned her gaze to  the surroundings, walking restlessly along the cragged bluff that she and her  sister were poised on. On the horizon beneath the wash of clouds, she could see  the wooden roofs of her village appearing like tiny pictures between the trees.  See swung her gaze over the beaten dirty trails that had led them up here,  weaving its sinuous way amongst the forest trees and past the Amazon paddy  fields, the rice stalks poking through a pool of diamonds as the wind rippled  the fields fluid surface. To the north she could see the veil of mist that  roiled continuously around the site of Jusenkyo, shrouding the cursed pools  from innocent and curious eyes.</p><p>Humming a random tune, Ling Ling gave  up. She could not see the lion and since it probably knew they were hunting it,  knew it would not be tempted to show its self. She hefted her trident in both  hands and brought it to rest across her shoulders, pacing across the pale rocks  and scuffing at the fine dust with her shoes.</p><p>"Stop making such a racket," Lung  Lung growled. "I can't concentrate." She resumed running her hands along the  stone, sniffing at the air. Ling Ling muttered under her breath and moved to  sit by a stack of boulders that lay in a heap by the rock face.</p><p>Her weight continued to sink as with  a loud crack the rocks gave way beneath her, seeming to crumble through the  mountain and sending her tumbling into darkness, before the lights flashed for  an instant before her eyes.</p><p>"Ling Ling are you okay?"</p><p>She opened her eyes at the sound of  her sister's panicked voice and winced, as the streams of light that flooded  from the hole above her seemed painfully bright compared to the blackness that  surrounded her. Ling Ling pulled herself upright, groaning as her muscles  protested the act. She glanced back at the hole that she had dropped through,  where the shock of jade hair marked her sisters curious and concerned face, and  thanked her Amazonian toughness. Spitting out the dust that had caked her lips  she wiped at the sticky fluid she felt trickle down her chin, holding her hand  up to the light to see the crimson smear that confirmed it as blood.</p><p>"Ling Ling? Sister?" Lung Lung  called, her voice starting to waver.</p><p>"I'm okay." Ling Ling called back,  pushing a shattered chuck of stone away to gather herself to her feet, her  knees shaking as pain blossomed in her ankles. She coughed and waved her arms  at the dust that swarmed in the beam of light that shot in from the hole above.  Moving to edge she squinted into the gloom as shapes began to coalesce in the  meagre glow.</p><p>She was in some sort of chamber. The  smoothness of the wall beneath her fingers told her this was no natural  formation, and driven by curiosity that swelled in her stomach she stepped  forwards cautiously, trying to make sense as the room's features were slowly  revealed. There was a rustling and a crunch beneath her slippers as she moved,  glancing at the floor she saw that it was littered with the fragments of paper  scattered disorderly amongst the dust. She glanced at where the chamber was  illuminated by the light from above, and saw broken and charred pieces of wood  from what had once been shelves jumbled along the walls.</p><p>Her next step was halted as her  pelvis bumped into something in the darkness. She reached out and lay her hands  on what seemed to be a table of cold stone, it was circular she discovered as  she felt the curve of its edge. Her intrepid fingers also found more papers  strewn across the slab. She grabbed a handful and stepped back to regard her  findings in the light.</p><p>Beneath some smudged writings was a  skilled but simple drawing of inked lines. It depicted a figure crouching upon  crossed and folded legs, body coiled but head held high and hands raised one  held flat across his chest while the other was poised aloft, two fingers  outstretched and forked. Ling Ling's brow bunched with recognition. It was the  Snake Flicks its Tongue posture from the Amazonian Divine Battle Fist, an old  and powerful style that the matriarch had taught her family alone.</p><p>Her frown dissolved as she flipped  through the other papers she had gathered, all had similar drawings and all  were of combat postures and techniques; from hand to hand, to weapons and even  Ki manipulation. The writings around the images were old and faded, yet she  just recognise the criticisms and complaints against that were listed against  the depicted movements speed, strength and vulnerability, some drawings evn  having thick crosses painted through them. Some of the techniques she  recognised as Amazon, others she had never seen the like of before.</p><p>"Ling Ling," her twin called. "Ling  Ling!"</p><p>"What?" she snapped, looking up from  the mysterious pages.</p><p>"What's that on the wall?" the girl  replied sticking an arm in through the hole to point the wall across the room  from where Ling Ling stood at the very edge of the glow that streamed from  outside.</p><p>Ling Ling rolled the pages in her  hand and squinted at the spot indicted by Lung Lung's outstretched finger.  Through the sandy dust and cobwebs that coated the chamber's walls she should  see glimmers of colour against the smooth, pale stone. Moving across she placed  her hand against the cold rock and brushed away the grime, the dust coming off  thick against her hand and falling to the floor. Her eyes widened as hidden  images came into the light for the first time in centuries.</p><p>A woman with bright scarlet hair was  rendered in flaking paint, twisting her body into a kick while beside her  another woman with tresses the colour of the sea threw a fist into the sky, a  hurricane blossoming at her side. Both women wore Amazonian garb, as did the  woman depicted above them, who crouched low hands held before here like claws.  However the figure next to her in the same pose was definitely not an Amazon,  his skin was covered in mottled black spots and stripes, the details of his  teeth showed pointed fangs and his eyes shone in silver gild. Elsewhere on the  mural another animal man, this time with cat like ears and a long bushy tail,  launched himself into a flipping kick that was blocked with a smile on the  talon like fists of a woman who hung in the hair, suspended by the outstretched  span of her brilliant white wings.</p><p>Ling Lings mouth worked but her  voice seemed to catch and cling in her throat. Swallowing she forced the sound  out from her mouth, forcing it into trembling words.</p><p>"Lung Lung, I think you should bring  an Elder."</p><p>White foam sprayed around the rocks that  sat in the streams path, the fast flowing water was kicked into frenzy as it  wove through the boulders, each wave crashing into another and churning around  the wet stones. Ahead the water calmed, widening into a shallow pool were the  rippled weaken and died. The water became like glass, a mirror that reflected  the bare image of the leafless trees, the dark ferns in perfect clarity. Black  clouds swarmed in the pools surface as they did in the grey of the winter sky.</p><p>Ranma frowned at the babbling stream,  rubbing the sore swelling on the back of his head where Ryoga had struck him in  return for launching them in to the bushes. Keeping his distance from the cold  water's flow he watched the Doctor, shrug the small pack from his shoulders.</p><p>The man looked much as he had over a  year ago when his clinic and closed and he a vanished without a word. The  circular glasses that still framed his dark eyes, that glinted with  intelligence as he swung his gaze over their surroundings. His dark brown hair  hand grown longer, though his still wore it as he always had, the thick brown  fringe parting around his face now hung to his chin and the neat tail now  laying between his shoulder blades. The smile was the most familiar the small  but warm curve to his lips that convinced everyone that he was the perfect man  for the equally gentle Kasumi Tendo.</p><p>"Are you sure it's okay to leave  those guys back there?" Ranma asked, ignoring Ryoga's pointed snort as he too  slung the bag from his shoulders, yet kept the umbrella protectively his fist.</p><p>"They'll be fine," Tofu replied in a  light tone, waving Ranma's concerns away with a sweep of his hand. "The Order  trains their warrior harder than that."</p><p>"Order?" the lost boy asked, before  Ranma could give voice to his own similar thoughts.</p><p>"The Heavenly Order of the Tao,"  Tofu answered settling himself on the flat surface of a nearby rock. "They're  the ones who you've managed to upset, and the one's who sent me those guys  after you, and me."</p><p>"You?" Ryoga gasped.</p><p>"Yes, I'm the only Japanese  student," The doctor said with a smile and a shrug. "Master Locke felt that the  Japanese trouble makers that appeared in their lands might be more willing to  explain themselves to a countryman." He pulled his backpack over and dug  around, extracting two bottles of soda and tossing them to the pair.</p><p>Ranma snagged one out of the air  with a blur but did not open it. Ignoring Ryoga's grumbling about not being a  troublemaker, he sat opposite the older man upon the hollowing out corpse of a  petrified log.</p><p>"This has something to do with that  blonde chick I fought the other day. Doesn't it" he inquired, tapping absently  on the lid of his soda, remembering where he had seen the guards fighting style  before.</p><p>Tofu chuckled, "Indeed Ranma. That  'blonde chick' is one of their most senior masters."</p><p>Feeling his brow furrow as he  scowled Ranma flicked a glance at Ryoga whose eyes had widened and his eyebrows  had disappeared beneath his bandana. "She never told me that," he heard the  other boy murmur.</p><p>Ranma sighed, "Sit down, Ryoga. This  will probably be a long story."</p><p>Ryoga turned back and forth, eyes  scanning across the ground for some place to sit. Seeing nothing but wet dirt  and pebbles he growled and dragged his heels to share the log with Ranma,  elbowing the pigtailed youth sharply and ordered him to move up. Ranma rolled  his eyes but did as asked.</p><p>"So who are these people and what  have they got against me?"</p><p>"You means besides the obvious fact  you're a jerk," Ryoga grunted dryly.</p><p>Suppressing the urge to elbow the  fanged boy's smart mouth, Ranma kept his eyes locked on Tofu's awaiting an  answer. The doctor kept on smiling.</p><p>"In good time, Ranma. First could  you tell me what you know about Taoism?"</p><p>Ranma blinked, "It's some kind of  religion isn't it?" <i>What the hell  does that have to do with anything?</i>  "Like Buddhism."</p><p>Tofu shook his head. "No, Ranma,  although Taoists do emphasise meditation and inner peace like Buddhists the  Taoist line of belief is quite different.</p><p>"The Taoist believe in nature in its  highest," he explained. "That the universe is governed by a force that set  everything into flawless, natural order. They call this order the Tao. It is  the essence of perfection and envelops everything into a cycle, where  everything starts as one unified whole, and then splits through elements and to  manifest the world and all its variety."</p><p>Ranma snorted, "Anyone who believe  in natural order has never been to Nerima."</p><p>The Doctor laughed, "No, I supposed  not. However you have just touched one of the great paradoxes of Taoism and of  life. If the universe is governed by order, why is the world so chaotic? The  fact is that chaos is just a facet of order."</p><p>"That makes no sense," Ryoga said.  "Chaos and Order are opposite things."</p><p>"Yes they are," Tofu agreed, bending  down his stretched out a finger and began to scratch at the dirt, drawing a  circle that he divided by a sinuous line down the middle and then poked two  dots into the pattern. "Consider the Ying and Yang, the balance of opposites  into a greater whole. Chaos and order are simply opposing but complimentary  parts of the higher force of the Tao. Such opposites are evident in all aspects  of life. Such as men and women, opposite in many ways but both genders need  each other, which is why love exists." A faint blush coloured the doctor's  cheeks, which made Ranma's lips curl to a small smile.</p><p>"You mean like positive and negative  charges, which is how electricity and stuff works?" he asked.</p><p>Tofu blinked rapidly, "Uh yes…that's  another good example."</p><p>"How would know about that stuff,  Ranma." Ryoga muttered loftily, glancing at him from the corner of his eyes.</p><p>"Someone gave me a book," he replied  in a curt voice, thinking about Cologne's gift that was stuffed in to the back  of his pack.</p><p>"And you read it?" the lost boy's  hand slapped over his mouth as he gave an exaggerated gasp. Ranma's hand  trembled as he fought the urge to belt the other youth into the skyline.</p><p>"As you've pointed out western  science is slowly beginning to understand what has been part of Chinese wisdom  for thousands of years." Tofu continued interjecting between the teenagers  argument. "My teacher has told me of something called Chaos theory, which shows  that even in seemingly sensible occurrences, there is an element of disorder that  shows that similar events do not have similar outcomes. Like how a drop of  water that falls onto the same spot on your hand, will roll in a different  direction as another one."</p><p>Both boys nodded, they had seen  Jurassic park too.</p><p>"However even in this chaos lurks a  sense of order so that it can be explained by western mathematics. However  physicists have only grasped half of the truth when they realised the relation  of disorder and energy. They realised that when energy flows through objects as  heat, they grow more anarchic, more muddled. They call this disorder Entropy."</p><p>"What does this have to do with  Willow and the people that Ranma managed to piss off?" Ryoga growled, fiddling  with a small stone as his feet tapped against the ground.</p><p>"Just a moment Ryoga, I'm explaining  as fast as I can." Tofu said, his smile never slipping. "The Second Law says  that the entropy of this world can only ever increase without external  energies, thus the natural order of things is to grow more chaotic. To restore  order, one must put in work and energy. Think of it like a bedroom, unless you  take the time and effort to clean it, it will steadily grow messier and  messier."</p><p>Tofu paused glancing at his  audience, Ryoga still scowled impatiently but Ranma had leant forward as he  listened and nodded to show his understanding. The doctor smiled as he adjusted  his glances and continued.</p><p>"However as I said scientists as yet  have only put together half of the puzzle. It is true that in natural the  universe grows more muddled, but as the Ying Yang shows, chaos is just one half  of the Tao. Just as the flow of heat both causes and is produced by the  increasing disorder, there is another energy that ripples through the cosmos to  restore order."</p><p>"Ki," Ranma gasped, eyes widening as  realisation came on him like the light that creeps of the horizon from a rising  sun.</p><p>Tofu's grin grew and he nodded. "Ki  is the life force that nourishes the order of the Tao. All things in the world,  time and space, are cyclic. Order falls to chaos and warmth flows like exhaust,  but then Ki returns order to all things."</p><p>Ryoga's fangs chewed at his lips.  "Willow said something similar; that her style of martial arts concentrated on  the harmonisation and development of Ki. She called it internal martial arts rather  than external muscle power."</p><p>"Yes," Tofu confirmed. "The Devine  Order of the Tao, are an ancient society who have lived on the mountain for  millennia. In keeping with our physics analogy, I suppose they could be thought  of as research scientists of Ki."</p><p>"Ki Scientists?" Ranma repeated,  lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>"In a way," the older man said with  a shrug. "Though they meditate rather than use experiments they have the same  aim, to understand the ways of nature and gain a deeper understanding of the  Tao. Through their meditations and through exercise they try to synchronise  their bodies Ki cycle with that of the world around them, and through that bond  learn how the energy manifests itself through the eight phases of nature."</p><p>"What phases?" Ranma broke in.</p><p>Tofu glanced up, eyes wide behind  the lenses of his glasses. "Did I not mention that?" Seeing the other boy shake  his head, his rubbed at the base of his skull sheepishly. "Sorry</p><p>"Many centuries ago a wise sage  named Bao Xi, meditated on the Tao had a revelation. He determined that the  energy of the Tao came through many changes and divisions as it permeates  through the universe." He leaned over to the mud again and beside his rendering  of the Ying Yang, he drew a long horizontal line. "First from nothing comes  something small, which blossom in to Tai Chi, the grand ultimate and the  inspiration for another internal martial art." He gestured at his line. "From  the Tai Chi come the two poles, Ying and Yang, representing the unity of  opposites." Beneath the line he drew two smaller one, one whole and the other  broken. "From the poles come four elements Si Xiang," He scratched four symbols  of unbroken and broken lines in the dirt and then eight small icons beneath.  "The four elements split into eight trigrams or Bagua which represent the eight  phases of nature."</p><p>Ryoga continued to frown at the  diagram while Ranma met the doctor's eyes, eyes narrowed with thought.</p><p>"Bao Xi wrote his theories into a  book known as the Yi Ching, the book of changes. The Bagua are the most  important the trigrams represent the cycle of Ki in nature. Ki begins in the  heavens; here it is pure energy with no shape, only intent. However it  condenses like rain and falls to the earth." He inscribed a downward arc in the  air with his finger. "As it does so the intent becomes form and order. However  the form is lose to chaos and heat, rising like warm air back to the heaven."  The finger curved as a back to the origin and completing the circuit.</p><p>"This is known as the greater cycle.  As the Ki energy transverses the cycle it shift thro many forms and manifests  itself as different types of energy." The Doctor began pointing at different  parts of the invisible circle. "Thunder, Fire, Water, Mountain, Lake, Wind  combined with the Heavens and Earth are the eight phases."</p><p>"You said something about our bodies  having a Ki cycle?" Ryoga reminded.</p><p>"The lesser cycle," Tofu supplied  with a nod. "The body is constantly keeping its cells and organs in a state of  order, this requires like the universe requires Ki energy. This Ki flows from  the head, where its is formless intention in the mind, downwards and is stored  in the Dan Tien, or as you more like know it, the Hara." The doctor opened the  black fabric of his gi to tap to fingers at his abdomen, indicating a point  about a thumbs length from his navel. "Nearly all methods of focussing and  using this inner energy mention this spot in some form or another."</p><p>"That's were I feel it," Ryoga said,  his voice a touch breathless. "When I draw my heavy Ki in for the Shi Shi  Hokodan, I feel a swelling. It's like a large weight is inflating inside my  stomach, then a push it through my hands."</p><p>Ranma nodded, familiar with the  experience from his use of the Moko Takabisha, yet instead of a weight he felt  a light and restless surging, like a fire fighting to get loose.</p><p>Doctor Tofu's smile had dropped into  a small frown. "You know the Shi Shi Hokodan?" He didn't even wait for the lost  boy's reply as he leant forwards and narrowed his eyes the young Hibiki. "Yes I  can see it now, the thickness of your aura. Be careful, Ryoga, to use that  technique too much is not very…" his brow furrowed, "healthy" he finished after  a moment.</p><p>"Uh Doc," Ranma said. "The Order?"</p><p>Tofu shook his head and his grin was  back on his face in a flash. "Yes, anyway." He paused and cleared his throat.  "The lesser cycle of the human body is much like the greater cycle in the  natural world. It divides into the eight phases as it moves through the eight  organs, kidneys, liver, stomach, heart, lungs, spine, spleen and brain. The Ki  also travels through eight channels around the body and into the eight  extremities, hands, feet, legs, chest, back, hips, abdomen and head. This is  the basis of shiatsu and other acupressure medicines and much herb lore,  depending on where the Ki is at what times. No doubt this is also how Elder  Cologne and Master Happosai continue to live after so many years. Death is  essential the body</p><p>"The Order of the Tao, by attuning  their bodies cycle with the cycle of nature try to learn from the Tao's  perfection and emulate it within themselves. By learning about the Ki flow in  the world and in themselves they can apply that knowledge in these medicines  and in other fields. Such as by understanding the flow of the energies of the  winds and waters they can predict the weather and the motions of the tides.  Such talents they share freely with the people, which makes them deeply revered  my the folk of this mountain."</p><p>That explained the shock and fury on  the faces of the townspeople after his fight with Willow, they had looked ready  to mob the two Japanese youth and lynch them from the rafters of the café.</p><p>"So why the martial arts, if they  are scientists?" Ranma queried.</p><p>"The Emei martial arts started as  exercises to harmonise one's own life force with the greater cycle, using  relaxed breathings methods and circular body motions. Eventually they blossomed  in to the internal fighting styles of Emei, including the most powerful  techniques of Bagua Zhang, the full secrets of which are taught only to the  senior masters."</p><p>"Like that blonde girl?" Ranma said,  glancing at the doctor for confirmation.</p><p>"Girl?" Ryoga spat. "Damn it, Ranma,  she had a name you jerk."</p><p>"Calm down, Ryoga, I'm not insulting  your girlfriend."</p><p>As expected that comment quietened  the lost one as his face flushed scarlet. He muttered quiet and muddled denials  as he suddenly became interested in the little circles his index fingers made  around each other. Ranma gestured for the Doctor to continue his explanation.</p><p>"Indeed, she probably does have a  name." Tofu muttered in a wondering tone, eyes rolling upwards as he  thought.  "However the name she took as  her own when she ascended to the council was Willow, master of winds. The Order  has many members, scholars and researchers and fighters, who help gather and  archive their wealth of knowledge. Most are orphans taken in by the order,  however some have come seeking wisdom.</p><p>"They are led by a council of eight masters, the ones who have  displayed the greatest affinity to the phases. Each of the eight were chosen  for by the previous master as soon as their talents are recognised, and are  taught the greatest secrets of the Order, including the most powerful martial  arts and the secrets of manipulating the bodies Ki energy to emulate the forces  of nature."</p><p>"That explains how she knew the Hiryu Shoten Ha," Ranma grumbled  feeling the last piece fall into place with a snap.</p><p>"The hurricane attack you used to defeat Happosai for the Moxibustion  cure?" Tofu pushed his glassed further along his nose and he gave a thoughtful <i>hmm. </i>"I can see how that would work. If they learnt how Ki energy forms  tornados they would be able to modify that knowledge to combat. That is the  power of Emei's Arts, what makes the masters so dangerous, and what makes them  interested in you, Ranma. That you defeated on of them has caused quite a stir  on this mountain. Master Locke said it has been over a hundred years since any  of them has lost a fight."</p><p>"You've mentioned this Locke before, Doc." Ranma said slowly. "Who is  he, and you still haven't said why you are here in China."</p><p>"Ranma!" Ryoga cried aghast.</p><p>"It a fair question, Ranma. I suppose I should explain my absence from  Nerima." Tofu said, scratching at the back of his head with a small chuckle.  "Locke is the Master of the Lakes, the oldest of the Eight Masters, and the  keeper of the Order's archives. A most wise and knowledgeable man, he is also  my teacher. You see I came to Emei mountain for the Order's knowledge of Ki  control, I wanted to gain more discipline over my inner energies to help me  with a certain condition." Red coloured the man's cheeks and the lenses of his  glasses had become misty. At once Ranma understood.</p><p>"I see," he said simply, willing to leave it at that but Ryoga had to  open his fanged mouth.</p><p>"What? What's wrong with you Doctor Tofu? Is it serious?" the lost boys  tone grew high and straggled.</p><p>This time the Ranma did strike out, bashed the other youth's skull with  his fist. "Shut up, idiot."</p><p>"It's okay," the older man said with a widening grin, but his blush  grew, spreading like scarlet fire over his face. "Master Locke called it 'love  fever', you see I feel quite strongly for this girl and when I was around her I  would act a little…odd."</p><p>"He made you and your nosebleeds look suave, Ryoga," Ranma expanded  with a sorry shake of his head, pigtail swaying. "He would just go nuts, poor  guy, dancing with that skeleton." He noticed Tofu lowering his head with a  frown. "Sorry Doc."</p><p>"Who was the girl?" Ryoga asked, suspicion larding his tone. "Was it  Akane?"</p><p>"Why the hell would it be that, tomboy?" Ranma yelled instinctively,  prompting Ryoga's snarl.</p><p>"Don't call her that," the lost one growled. "Isn't that who it usually  is anyway." He said more quietly. "You know all those princes kidnapping and  falling for, Akane."</p><p>Ranma considered this, and nodded with a sigh. "Yes I suppose it is.  However that isn't who the Doc's interested in." He regarded the older man with  a careful sidelong glance. "I can't say who it is, but it isn't Akane."</p><p>Doctor Tofu waved off Ranma's concerns with his hands. "Don't worry,  Ranma, I can say her name. It's K….K…" he paused, and began inhaling deeply  through his nose and releasing the air from his mouth, hands clenching and  unclenching against his knees. Ranma thought he could feel a trickle of power  from the man, and his glasses were now completely fogged. "K…Kasumi."</p><p>"Kasumi Tendo?" Ryoga asked with a blink. "Akane's sister?"</p><p>Tofu nodded, hands trembling.</p><p>"Anyway," Ranma cried, distracting the doctor from his romantic ideas  of the gentle sister. "You never said why these guys sent you here."</p><p>"Oh right," Tofu said as if snapping out of a trance. "Master Locke  wanted me to talk to you, and establish who you are and whether or not you are  some sort of threat." His face was near split by his grin. "But I can see that  you're not, so I can tell them it was all a misunderstanding and we can avoid  more trouble."</p><p>"With this jerk I doubt it," Ryoga murmured, jerking his thumb at  Ranma.</p><p>Ranma ignored the lost boy, "I still need to find her, and apologise."</p><p>Doctor Tofu nodded, "That's nice of you Ranma and should help smooth  this over. I'll see if I can arrange it." He trailed off, shedding his glasses  he cleaned the lenses with a kerchief pulled from his pocket and glanced up at  the sky.</p><p>The sun had fallen behind a wall of clouds, darkening the sky. The only  sounds in the air was the burble of the stream the rippled crashed through the  rocks, and the soft whisper of the winds as it shook the bare boughs of the  trees, their reflections repeating the same dance in the glassy surface of the  pool.</p><p>"Ranma?" the Doctor said softly, and replaced his glasses over his  eyes, turning to the youth, his smile gone and yearning in his eyes.</p><p>"Yes, Doc?"</p><p>"Tell me about Nerima," the older man swallowed stiffly. "Tell me about  Kasumi."</p><p>Ranma smiled. "What would you like to know?"</p><p>Sasuke felt his body jerk as he slammed into the wall, and slid slowly  along the surface to the floor like a thick stain. His body folded on the  carpet, his knees pressed against and head lolled. Something welled in his  lungs and his head jerked as he coughed harshly. He felt the thick clot of  blood flying from his mouth on to his stomach, and a thing red trail dripped  down his chin. Pain screamed in his chest and his senses swam, lights  continuing to flash in front of his eyes.</p><p>The icy grip of fear seized his heart as for the first time he looked  on his mistress with abject terror. His body began shaking so hard it felt like  he was having a fit and he jerked in petrified convulsions, as he watched  Kodachi's lips move. They were red, blood red, and slowly twisted from a  furious snarl to a wide and manic grin. Kodachi's room was always dark but now  the shadows waxed, growing ever blacker. With a shudder he released the  darkness was coming from her, her aura swarming with a blackness darker than  the night making her pale skin shine with such brilliant whiteness that it no  longer looked like living flesh, put as ashen as a death shroud. Her ribbon  twisted and coiled around her as if alive, a serpent that writhed, pulsated and  lashed, its razor edge tearing through the chairs and tables like fangs.</p><p>She tossed back her head, dark locks lost in the shadows that massed around  her like a litter of spawn to their mother, and she released that long,  demented laugh. Each long peal resounded like the tolling of the dead's bell  and reduced Sasuke to tears, racking him with chocking sobs. All he could think  was one single thought that he clung to desperately.</p><p><i>Don't shoot the messenger.</i></p><p>To be continued.</p><p>AN- Uh…sorry  there's a lot of theory to this chapter, but I need to set the basis for  various plots later both involving the Order and the use of Ki in general. It's  all based on the real ideas behind Ki in Chinese martial arts and Bagua (of  which my understanding is not perfect and has been embellished). However I did  add the science bit because I thought it would make things more understandable,  and be a bit more original since in most fics Ki energy is always at odds with  science so I wanted to bring them hand in hand. I hope you found it interesting  and if not I'm sorry and let me know how to improve ^_^.</p><p>Also hope I answered peoples  concerns about Ranma and fighting girls. The series makes it clear he is  reluctant to fight girls, but he will if he has to. Also his words "a guy holds  back a lot when he fights a girl" shows that if he does have to fight he will  try and do it without hurting. If you have anything to say, about my depiction  of this or of Shampoo in this chapter, leave your e-mail or send me one, the  same with all other constructive comments or criticism. Cheers</p>Glossary<p><b>Hara: </b>'Belly,' the point in the abdomen two inches  below the navel and the human bodies centre of gravity. It is also the point in  Japanese belief where internal energy and Ki is found and stored so it can be  harnessed. In Chinese it is called the <b>Lower Dan Tien</b>.</p><p><b>Greater Cycle: </b>In Taoist belief it is the flow of Ki from  pure energy in the heavens to the earth and back, shifting to manifest as the  eight phases of nature.</p><p><b>Lesser Cycle: </b>The flow of Ki from the centre of the mind  to the hara in the human body, which nourishes the organs and channels the  energy through the body.</p><p><b>Tao: </b> The  perfect and divine natural forces which balances the universe in harmony.  Taoist religion is based on reaching enlightenment by becoming one with the  Tao.</p><p>Uh think that's it.  Thanks to Rob for his great help, Larry for hosting and you for reading.</p><p>e H</p>
