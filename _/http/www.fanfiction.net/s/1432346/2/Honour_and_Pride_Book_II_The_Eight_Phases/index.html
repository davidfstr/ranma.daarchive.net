</div><p><b><i>Honour And Pride</i></b><b></b></p><p>By Beer-Monster</p><p>Book II: The Eight Phases.</p><p><i>Chapter Two: The Fires  of the Forge</i></p><p><i>Perseverance is more  prevailing than violence; </i></p><p><i>and many things which  cannot be overcome when they are together,</i></p><p><i> yield themselves up when taken little by  little - </i>Plutarch</p><p>The rain fell in relentless sheets,  a wet mist that was invisible against the gloom of the night sky but for the flickering  orange halos around the glowing streetlights. The air was heavy with the crisp  scent of moist grass and filled by the endless hiss of the falling showers.</p><p>Genma Saotome took another sip of  sake as he sat beneath the sloping roof of the Tendo dojo, watching the rain as  it made ripple and after ripple upon the once tranquil surface of the koi pond.  He loved to watch the rain, even after Jusenkyo.  It brought him peace for some reason he could not comprehend.  Maybe he thought that falling downpour could wash away the taint of the things  he had done in his life. Maybe it was the memories evoked, visions of a less  complicated time when he would train in the storm, matching his stance against  the winds and punching with the crack of the thunder; when the Master had  actually taught him, watching with an auspicious eye as his best pupil mastered  the art; times when he had travelled Japan, slamming his knuckles into the tree  under a fine drizzle; times when he squatted in the rain by the roaring of the  sea and presented two open palms as small targets for his young son to punch  and kick.</p><p>He sighed wistfully and poured  another measure of wine into his cup. Those days were gone; he could no longer  enjoy the rain without the detestable feeling of wet fur. And his son was gone,  thinking that his father had nothing left to teach, he had left the nest. He  had become a man.</p><p>Genma snorted into his wine. <i>Question is:</i> <i>Can he stay that way? </i></p><p>His lips twisted as he remembered the last time he had seen his son.  Ranma had thought everything he had said was a joke; but then he had always  been an ungrateful brat. He sometimes thought that he had taught the boy too  well. Everything Genma had done, he had done for Ranma, but now everything  Ranma did was for Ranma. He had left without a thought for the all the work his  poor father had done for him, or for his mother.</p><p>The large mans' mouth curled into a  smile even as his hand absently stroked his lower belly. The woman was  quicksilver, warmth and smiles one second, cold eyes and a viper tongue the  next. But then that was why Genma loved her. And it was why he was sure that  Ranma cared for Akane, no matter what the boy said. Such women were a weakness  bred to all Saotome men.</p><p>Nodoka had been cold since Ranma  left, the loss of her only child for the second time had wounded her deeply.  But Genma knew there was more to it than that. He had lied and cheated enough  people to know how to read a person who was hiding something, and his wife was  too proud and honourable to do it well. Ranma had probably said something to  her; that was how he usually pissed people off, his big mouth. <i>Don't know where he picked it up, I  certainly didn't teach the boy! </i></p><p>However his wife's attitude had  turned around throughout the day. Her smile had returned, but without its usual  warmth. He ran a finger over the clean and crisp white fabric of his gi. She  had wrestled it from him while he had played with his tyre, and thrown it into  the wash.</p><p>Nodoka's  smile had returned, lacking its usual warmth as if it were a mask worn to cover  an obviously troubled mind. All day she had bustled about the house, armed with  duster, mop and vacuum cleaner, sending poor Kasumi into a spin. She had hummed  as she worked, as she often did, but the sound was strained and melody  wandering. Her flurry had finally stopped a short time ago as she retired to  her bed.</p><p>A smile  found its way onto Genma's lips, his cheek tingling as he recalled the kiss she  had placed there, leaning over him as she whispered</p><p>"Don't be long, dear."</p><p>His grin grew wider, his wife's coy  invitation returning vigour to his bones as he sipped up the last of his sake.  Many times as he had travelled with Ranma, Genma had thought of Nodoka's chaste  yet forceful touch, and since his reunion with his love he had thought of it  more. Basking in the afterglow and savouring the feel of the sweat on her skin,  he often wondered how he had ever lived without it.</p><p>Setting his  cup aside he stood, knowing that his wife would still be waiting for him. He  inhaled deeply, taking in the crisp scent of the rain through his nostrils and  letting it revive him, unfortunately accustomed to the fact that at his age  some things required time to 'get going'.</p><p>Feeling his  blood begin to stir, he began padding silently up the staircase, taking care  not to make any sound that might wake Soun or his daughters. He would hate to  face them at breakfast should they be forced to eavesdrop on Nodoka and him.</p><p>He paused  outside of the room he had once shared with his son, and saw the orange glow of  the bedside lamp leaking beneath the door, confirming that Nodoka was still  awake.</p><p>His smile  slipped into a smirk as he performed a short warm up, like an athlete preparing  for an Olympic event. He massaged the muscles of his back and hip and rotated the  joints of his wrist and neck, stretching out his fingers. He quickly brought a  hand up and breathed into it to check his breath. With a satisfied nod, he  pushed his glasses further on the bridge of his nose, and pulled at the opening  of his gi so that more of his hairy, bloated chest was revealed. Head held  high, he slid open the door to the room and swept in.</p><p>The smile  dropped from his lips as his eyes locked upon the steely glare of his still  clothed wife. His gaze ran across the prim, blue fabric of her kimono as if to  confirm its presence with his mind, but then he saw the katana, imposing even  in its black scabbard propped against the wall, well within reach of her small  hands. He swallowed loudly as he could feel the blood drain from his face.</p><p>"We need to  talk, husband," she said simply, in that womanly tone which killed all  possibility of argument.</p><p>Heart  falling to his stomach he nodded. "Yes dear."</p><p>He trudged  to where she waited, feet sliding woefully, stretching out the seconds. However  the tightening of her frown sped his pace and he slumped cross-legged across  from where she knelt in seiza upon the tatami. Licking dry lips he waited for  her to break the silence.</p><p>"Genma, why  has our son fled his manly duties?" she asked firmly.</p><p>Genma bit his  lip and tugged at the collar of his gi. He cursed her for starting this with a  question, and a vague one at that. The range of answers he could give was too  vast, and her face a mask of steel. How was he supposed to know what she wanted  to hear, and what would keep his head on his shoulders?</p><p>"Um…I would  think that he feels that perfecting his studies of the Art is very manly," he  ventured quietly.</p><p>Nodoka's  eyebrow arched at his statement. <i>Not a good sign,</i> he thought with a  frown.</p><p>"Do you  agree with him?" she asked.</p><p>"Of course  not," he cried, filling his voice with anger and outrage to amplify his  rebuttal, not hard task as he had plenty to spare for his son.</p><p>"And did  you tell him about your disapproval?"</p><p>"Yes, and I  tried to talk him out of it." Genma was glad of the opportunity to use the  truth to his advantage; it made the lies sound more convincing.</p><p>"I did so  as well," she admitted. "But he still went. In direct disobedience of both of  his parents." Her eyes flashed as she glared daggers at Genma who shrank into  his gi. "Respect for his mother and father is an important quality, and should  be evident in a 'man-amongst-men'."</p><p>The phrase  he had written upon that yellowed and accursed contract, combined with the  piercing gaze of his fuming wife caused Genma Saotome's minimal courage to flee  in terror. His head hung low as he avoided her eyes, his body reduced to a  quivering shell.</p><p>"I tried to  teach the boy respect Nodoka, really I did." He whined. "The boy would not  listen. It's not my fault." He could feel the sweating begin to soak though the  material of his bandana, and tears stung at his eyes.</p><p>"I know,"  he heard her sigh. Sensing a change in her mood, he dared a darting glance up  at her. The steel of her posture still remained, but the cold edge of her anger  seemed to have quietened. Genma allowed himself to relax a little, settling  back into a more composed position. He kept his guard up though, watching the  woman carefully. Her fury was like the glowing embers of a fire: calm but still  hot and ready to explode into flame at the slightest provocation. It reminded  him of the simmering rage of his son, and deadliness of those eruptions at  Jusendo.</p><p>"I have  come to realise his lack of respect and manners is my fault, as those are among  the things a mothers should teach her son." For a second hurt flickered across  her beautiful features and made Genma's own heart ache in tandem. But it was  gone in an instant, swallowed beneath the calm surface.</p><p>"I have  tried to remedy this, because in his heart Ranma tries hard to be an honourable  man, despite certain influences." Genma winced at her tone, guilt beginning to  gnaw in his chest but he quashed it, ruthlessly telling himself that good men  fall the hardest.</p><p>Nodoka gave  no sign that she had seen his reaction and continued heedlessly. "I tried to  show him where his duty lies, but the boy's arrogance set him on this fool  quest of his. I told him that his duty was to the Art, and he twisted that into  an excuse to land himself into more trouble." Her voice was scathing.</p><p>Genma  considered his wife's words, finally understanding what had prompted Ranma to  acknowledge his status as the Anything-goes heir and the responsibilities that  came with it. He felt a swell of pride for his son; that the boy had chosen where  his duty lay for himself, and not let himself be dictated to by his mother and  her traditions. Unfortunately such independence could get them both killed.</p><p>"What  should he have done?" he asked in a small voice, knowing that the question  invited condemnation.</p><p>She shot  him a sharp glare, "He should marry Akane of course," she spat.</p><p>"Of  course," he agreed with a small smile, happy that her support for him on this  matter was so strong. He had been worried that she would grow fond of their  son's other suitors and knew that she considered that Ranma should have many  mistresses; despite the hatred Akane would obviously have for such an idea. He  had not minded the idea himself at first, more lovers meant greater chance of  an heir, but he knew Akane would be repulsed, thinking the concept perverted,  and Ranma had to marry a Tendo. Genma's agreement with Soun was vital, and with  Kasumi's affection for Dr Tofu and Nabiki's career aspirations and disrespect  of martial arts, Akane was the only horse they could back.</p><p>"I could  not stop him from leaving on his journey, especially not after Master Happosai  intervened." Her lips twisted into a disgusted sneer, her opinion of the  Anything-Goes founder had never been high and there was bad blood between them.</p><p>"But I did try to make him face up to his duty to yours and  Soun's agreement. But he refused plainly and directly."</p><p>Genma  suppressed a shudder as he watched his wife's frame quiver with stifled anger.</p><p>"I tried to  make him reconsider." Her body went limp as she sighed, "but he had obviously  thought his excuse through in detail, and I could not fault his reasoning."  Nodoka shook her head, obviously feeling that she somehow should have found a  flaw. Genma blinked, his son had never been one to exercise logic outside of  his fights. That the boy had won over his thoughtful mother disturbed and  intrigued Genma all at once.</p><p>"What did  he say?" he asked tentatively.</p><p>"That he  only wants to marry for love," she snorted. "He would let his own feelings  interfere with his duty to the Art and his family, not caring for the folly of  such an act."</p><p>The  bitterness in her voice was like a whip. He bit at his lip to stop himself  jerking like a man flogged, painful memories of his own courtship with Nodoka  spinning in his mind.</p><p>Her family had disapproved of his  affections, the last scion of a fallen shogun clan who lived the life of a  vagabond martial artist under the tutelage of a perverted dwarf, was not  considered acceptable for the daughter of a very traditional and ancient clan whose  ancestors had played a part in the building of a nation after the bakumatsu. He  did not resent them for holding such an opinion; they had been right and were  still. But he had been young, filled with naïve thoughts about the honour of  the martial arts, and completely blinded by love. He had pursued her regardless  of her father's will or his swords, and was delirious when she had returned his  feelings. Back then it had seemed like an epic tale come to life, the hero who  won the fair maiden despite all odds.</p><p>Truth was he was more villain than hero, but he still loved the  woman, and her shame of him wounded deep. But he knew he could bear it, as he  had borne many things, because he had gifted the Art with his son. He would  bear a great deal more until he was sure that Ranma would do the same.</p><p>"He loves Akane, I know he does."  Genma lied, the truth was Ranma cared for all three of his fiancés, but he need  not say that.</p><p>Her gaze remained doubtful. "I told  him that the his duty lay in continuing the school, and that regardless of the  agreement, Akane's suit was the most favourable for such a task," she said. "If  his future is to be secured and the school to build any sort of reputation, he  would need a dojo in which to teach the Art and provide a sense of permanent  presence."</p><p>Genma nodded sagely, that was the  reason he and Soun had made the engagement pact, to ensure the future of their  School. It also provided a cosy place for him and his old friend to retire and  live comfortably as their two children and their heirs carried on their legacy  and did all the work; but he told himself that that was just a fortuitous  consequence.</p><p>"Ranma argued this point, saying  that another dojo could be built. He also said that Akane's contribution to the  growth of the style would be minimal as her techniques are already part of the  school, and that his other two suitors offer new talents and that their skills  in combat exceed Akane's."</p><p>Genma cursed his son and wondered  when the brat had become so crafty. He had always considered the skill  difference between Akane and her rivals a minor point as Ranma was more than  talented enough to teach the art without assistance once he knew how, and that  he would continue to protect her if the chef or Amazon became dangerous. That  his son had weighed such an ability difference and used it to justify his  actions spoke volumes of his commitment to his new path.</p><p>"I take it from your expression  that this is true?" Nodoka asked with a raised her eyebrow. He nodded  wordlessly.</p><p>"I thought so. Not that I'm  surprised, especially when it comes to Shampoo. Her culture and laws respect  strength above all, and then there is her Grandmother. That old woman is wise,  cunning, and from what I've heard, a living archive of mysterious techniques  and powers. It is said that she is equal to the Master." Again her lips  tightened. Genma continued nodding, it was all true.</p><p>"Be that as it may," Nodoka said firmly. "We can not let this  stand in the way of that which honour demands. One does not make excuses to  duty. One only does what is required. If we can not change Ranma's mind, then  we must change the situation."</p><p>Genma's eyes narrowed. "What do  you mean?" he asked tentatively. The resolution in Nodoka's face worried him;  she was planning something, and that to him was reason to be wary.</p><p>"You, husband, must train Akane."</p><p>"WHAT?" he yelled suddenly,  earning a tight frown of disapproval from his wife.</p><p>"I'm sure you heard me perfectly  well, dear."</p><p>" B…but she's a girl." He  spluttered, her brow furrowed as her grimace deepened.</p><p>"I'm aware of that, Genma," she  said. "But despite your chauvinistic opinions, the role of a martial artist's  wife has always been that of a warrior. Tradition dictates that as the wife of  a martial artist, the maintenance and defence of the home is Akane's  responsibility. Judging from the powerful adversaries that our son is said to  attract, her current level of training would be insufficient for such a task.  The escort of a Samurai must be expected to fight for her husband's honour in  his absence, and must also care for the family blades."</p><p>Genma swallowed the lump that had  grown in his throat as he glanced at the katana that leaned upon the wall. He  felt a thick bead of sweat slide slowly down his cheek.</p><p>"Also, Akane is the only official  student of the Tendo dojo and the Anything-goes school." she continued,  "With Ranma gone the task of answering  challenges and defending the school is hers, as is only right as his fiancé,  and so she must be prepared for such combat. If we should be challenged  tomorrow by some wandering fighter, or worse by one of Ranma's other suitors,  we would lose much more than our sign. We would lose our future."</p><p>Genma's shoulders sagged as he  stared at the floor, a nervous scowl forming lines upon his face and at his  eyes. Nodoka smirked.</p><p>"Unless of course you would  rather answer the challenges yourself."</p><p>Genma jerked upright with a start  as if hit by lightning, staring at her with wild, frightened eyes. The woman's  smirk widened as he squirmed. He fidgeted for a moment, mouth twisted and brow  furrowed. His eyes dropped from Nodoka's cool gaze, and his hands wrung at his  gi.</p><p>"I can't teach her," he said in a  weak voice. "She is Soun's student, I would need his permission."</p><p>Nodoka shrugged. "I'm sure he'll  give it when we explain that it is to secure the union of our families and his  dojo."</p><p>Knowing he was trapped, Genma  slumped with a drawn out sigh and nodded his head in a small, almost  imperceptible gesture.</p><p>"I'll teach her," he grunted.</p><p>The smirk grew into a warm,  loving smile and the steel of her posture faded into a serene calm. Her  shoulders relaxed and she knelt, proudly yet with tenderness, her hands folded  upon her lap as she looked at him almost meekly.</p><p>"Thank you husband," she said  softly, inclining her head into a gracious bow.</p><p>Genma blinked rapidly as his jaw  dropped. He continued to gawp, pole-axed as Nodoka moved forwards upon her  knees, so that she could wrap him in her gentle arms. She sagged against his  large frame, her body pressing upon his as she laid her head upon his broad  shoulder. He could not stop his mouth curving into a small smile as he brought  his large, callused hands to wind around the hollow of her waist. He heard her  sigh contently into his ear and press her lips to his neck, sending a shiver  through him.</p><p>But his eyes remained open as his  wife enveloped him in her embrace, and stared intently as the bound sword that  lay in the corner, as she pushed him onto his back.</p><p>The nights were hot in Thailand,  even in winter. The clammy grip of the humid air clung to everything, the warm  moisture hanging stagnant in the darkness. The white walls of the buildings  glowed ethereal silver in the moonlight, the pale disc inciting the wailing  song of the cicada and the subtle hiss of the snakes. The thick leaves of the  trees, rustled gently in the windless night, moving with the teaming, nocturnal  wild.</p><p>The trees began to move with  greater ardour as the creatures of the night began to panic at the percussive  cracks and thuds that rang in the air. The people of the village continued to  sleep with the blissful ignorance and false security of humanity, while the  animals fled, their higher array of senses more sensitive to the building power  crackling in the atmosphere.</p><p>Ryu Kumon continued to train long  into the night, pounding into the wooden man with his fists and knees. His  knuckles were swollen and red, the course skin broken, but he did not feel it.  The souls of his feet were abraded by the coarse white stone floor of the Kai  Muay, but he paid them no mind. All that mattered was the dummy that shook and  creaked with every impact of his hardened shins.</p><p>The Thai  fighters had laughed when he had built the bulky apparatus, thinking that the  idea of striking, a piece of dead wood as if it were a real opponent ludicrous.  They were satisfied with their heavy bags and hard sparring. However, there  were techniques that could not be trained upon the bag or used upon a partner,  not if you or anyone else ever wished to spar with them again.</p><p>They had  seen little of merit outside the brutal art of Muay Thai that every man in  Thailand longed to master. It had only taken one demonstration of the dummy's  uses to change their minds. Soon they were all asking to use it, and Ryu had  let them, smirking in satisfaction as all but the fiercest limped away after  the first few blows, and some had even seen rubbing salves into their amassed  bruises.</p><p>Muay Thai was a simple yet  violent martial art, its exponents known worldwide as being some of the  greatest and toughest fighters in the world. However the training mostly  stressed the conditioning of the shins, fists, knees and elbows as weapons. The  palms of the hands, as well as the forearms were not built to the same  durability; and after simulating powerful blocks and parries upon the three  sturdy poles protruding from the dummies chest that served as its arms, deep  bruises and shallow cuts were the result. Ryu did not have the heart to tell  them that he was not using his full strength, not yet.</p><p>They had  accepted the mokujin as part of a balanced regime now, and often asked many  question about its uses, manufacture and history as well as proposed  modifications. One question had presented it self in the beginning but had  faded when the only reply was grit teeth and furious eyes. <i>Why did the  Mokujin have a pigtail?</i></p><p>He stared  at the accessory now, a simple affair made of twisted and bundled straw, died  black to resemble the one that had inspired it. It was there to remind him of  his mission.</p><p>He slammed  his fist into the dummies face hard enough to split the wood and make the  structure quiver.</p><p>He had  rushed recklessly into his fight with Ranma Saotome, and though the battle had  been magnificent, the price had been high. Ryu did not carry any spite against  the Anything-goes heir for his defeat, but the true weight of the oath he had  made as a consequence was crushing.</p><p>Ryu Kumon  was a martial artist to the core, never truly alive unless the rush of battle  was singing in his veins. He had promised to restore his family name, yet  without the fire of the warrior he would have long since given up the hardship.  Those flames as much as his fathers last words, had driven him to mastery of  the forbidden art of the Yamasen-ken.</p><p>Such  mastery came at a price. Ryu had been so focussed in his study of the  Yamasen-ken, that it had become all he knew. His entire fighting style had  revolved around those techniques, his whole life did. The way he moved, the way  he stood and spoke, even his dreams; all stemmed from the Yamasen-ken. Even his  memories of the first martial arts lessons given to him by his father had  become melded and inseparable from his solitary training under the guidance of  Genma Saotome's scrolls. Yet, he was bound by his honour and his word- to never  practise that dangerous form of Anything-goes martial arts.</p><p>It was  impossible. Those techniques had been all he had for so long. His only memory,  his only solace afters the destruction of his dojo, his only friend. To give up  the Yamasen-ken was asking him to give up breathing, to abandon everything he  knew his life to be and to forsake who he was.</p><p>The blow  had hit Ryu hard, yanking the ground from under him and letting him fall into a  chasm of rage, despair and regret. He hated the Saotomes for forcing that  promise upon him. He despised himself more for agreeing to it without a thought  like the arrogant fool he was. The realisation that he had nothing other than  the Yamsen-ken; that there was nothing to his life other than skill in a combat  art that was originally intended to rob homes and mug people, had left a  gnawing pain in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>As many had before him, he sought  comfort at the bottom of a bottle, the fiery taste of liquor being the only  thing that distracted him from the bitter tang of defeat and allowed him to  forget his woes. In the morning however, his pain would return with  reinforcements as he woke to sunlight that scorched his reddened eyes and in  alley that he had never before seen, yet with the familiar scent of vomit  burning his nostrils. When his thoughts finally came to Nodoka Saotome, the  kind woman whose care he had stolen from her true son, and imagined her  frowning at wreck he had become, it became too much. He would seek out another drink,  and the cycle would repeat itself.</p><p>His youth  denied him his supply of alcohol at all but the seediest parts of Tokyo. Driven  by his sorrow, he had become a regular customer in the dim-lighted, blood and  filth stained dens of the city, calmly knocking back his medicine while junkies  shot up in the dark corners and the bar tender mopped up the broken glass and  teeth.</p><p>In such  places a man can not remain a spectator for long.</p><p>Ryu could  not remember what he had done to piss this guy off; perhaps he had done nothing  and the man wanted attention, perhaps he was drinking the wrong brand of whisky  or had slammed his glass down too loudly. It could have been anything or  nothing, all he knew was a large, meaty hand had hauled him from his stool and  he was staring upwards at the shaven head of a huge, angry man with a thick  moustache framing a wide mouth full of gapped, yellowed teeth and vile tobacco  breath. Ryu had said nothing, but did not need to as his body bloated and  unleashed a loud belch straight into the face of the towering stranger. The  man's beady eyes narrowed and Ryu watched him wind up a haymaker with his  ham-sized fist.</p><p>Instinct  moved him though the alcoholic haze. He staggered to the left, slipping  clumsily out of the punches path, his arms rising and sweeping apart in a  scissor motion, one knocking the incoming fist upwards, whilst the other had  slapped down the assailants other hand, destroying any attempt of a guard. He  pivoted woodenly on his left foot so that he could spin the other leg into a  powerful, ki charged roundhouse kick. It ploughed into the large man's belly  and sent him flying backwards to slam into the wall of the bar, plasterboard  cracking in the impact.</p><p>As the rush  of adrenaline purged the alcohol from his system, the events replaying in his  rapidly clearing mind, he made an ecstatic realisation. The technique he had  used was a revision of the Mouko Kaimon Ha of the Yamasen-ken. It used the same  concept, knocking aside the opponents arms with your hand to leave him  unprotected for your crushing kick, but it had not been the same move as  described in the scrolls. In fact it did not resemble the original attack at  all.</p><p>The  revelation had stuck him like a bolt of lightning that electrified his mind. He  had been given a true epiphany. The oath he had made to Ranma Saotome forbade  him from using the techniques of the Yamsen-ken, but the founding philosophy of  the method, its strategy and principle were still functional. He would use them  to found a new martial art, one superior to the Yamasen-ken, the Umisen-ken or  any other art that would ever be created. It would be the supreme fighting  method, one that would live up to the memory of his father and restore his  family honour. He had even given it a name; <i>Kumon Ryu Kyoku-ken, </i>the art  of the ultimate fist.</p><p>However to  remain true to his word, his new style would have to be completely independent  from the Anything-goes school, with different movements, different stances and  different attacks. To truly be rid of the Yamasen-ken, he would have to unlearn  the Saotome Ryu.</p><p>Ryu blasted  a barrage of roundhouse kicks into the dummy, aiming them low at the base and  striking hard with his shins. A smile found its way onto his face through the  pants and grunts of his effort. He had come a long way in the last year.</p><p>He had  begun in central Tokyo, he had enrolled at a Kyokushinkai dojo, hoping to learn  what he had heard was the 'strongest form of Karate.' He had adapted to the  style quickly, but it was not enough. The techniques were too reminiscent of  the Anything-Goes movements; the kicks were delivered the same way and the  punches thrown in a similar manner as to those he already employed. The  Musabetsu Kakuto Ryu was still a Japanese style at its core, and its  foundations were shared by the many forms of unarmed combat to have flowered  upon the Land of the Rising Sun.</p><p>If Ryu was  to succeed in leaving the Anything-Goes mark behind him, he would have to leave  Japan. Deciding that China was unsuitable, as the arts of Japan had descended  from the old Tang styles, he had set his sights south and journeyed on.</p><p>He studied  where he could, challenging the fighters he found, absorbing their techniques  and strategies from painful first hand experience. The understanding and  knowledge of many attacks seeping into him as he lay panting, bruised from  their power. He had found Masters and had learnt all he could as fast as he  could take it, training the movements through endless and agonising repetition,  until they came without thought, burning his previous methods from memory.</p><p>He had learnt many things as he travelled,  relentlessly focussed upon his mission. In the Philippines he had learnt the  deadly unarmed techniques of Kali. In Malaysia he had fought against experts of  Pentjak Silat, making their art his. Several months ago he had completed his  tutelage in Burma, under the guidance of three renowned Masters of Bando,  before hiking into Siam to try his hand at the brutal sport of Muay Thai.</p><p>Like a master  smith he had created his weapon. With his own will as the fire, his body as the  ore, and his heart as the forge he had begun. Each of these styles he had  moulded and shaped until they were one with his own method and his own designs.  Tempered and made strong but flexible through the house analogy of the  Yamasen-ken strategy, he had crafted the iron core of what would become the  greatest fighting art in existence. Now what remained was to polish and sharpen  the blade until it shone with lethal promise.</p><p>He would do that through combat,  each victory would serve as a whetstone on which his skills would be sharpened.  At then for the final test of the edge, he would defeat Ranma Saotome and claim  the sign and the honour of the Anything-Goes School of Martial Arts.</p><p>Akane shivered as she entered the  dojo. Winters' grip had crept into the training hall, its touch cooling the  polished wood of the floor until lances of ice shot through her feet despite  the thin tatami covering. The hall was illuminated by lanterns that emitted a  soft orange glow, the golden halo of dawn just beginning to slide above the  horizon.</p><p>Genma sat with his legs crossed  upon the floor despite the cold, arms folded across his wide chest. He glowered  at the doorway as Akane entered, a grimace twisting the tightened line of his  mouth.</p><p>"I said ten minutes," he grunted  sourly.</p><p>Akane ignored the remark,  returning his glare in equal measure.</p><p>"What is this all about Uncle  Saotome?" she demanded.</p><p>The large man's frowned deepened  and his brow furrowed, eyes narrowing as he stared intently through his  spectacles, somehow managing to look down upon her even as he sat upon the  mats.</p><p>"I'm here to train you," he said  simply, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>Obvious or not, Akane was stunned,  her mouth working soundlessly but no words would form in her numbed mind. Her  eyes then narrowed to slits, tilting her head to glare sidelong at the bald  man.</p><p>"Why?" she asked softly, drawing  the word out</p><p>"Why not!"</p><p>Her teeth ground against each  other at the reply. She stomped forwards, hands balled into tight fists upon  her hips as she frowned at Genma. As she approached he stood quickly, as if  unwilling to concede an advantage in height. He met her glare with calm eyes  that seemed to look beyond her face. She broke the silence with a snort.</p><p>"I thought girls lacked the  strength and dedication to learn the art," she recited acerbically. She knew  exactly were Ranma had learnt his chauvinist attitudes. Her words had no effect  on Genma. His folded arms and condescending gaze grated at her nerves.</p><p>"You're not a girl," he grunted.</p><p>"Not a girl," she spat through  her clenched teeth; images of Ranma mocking her danced through her brain. Now  his father seemed to be picking of where the son had left off. "WHAT AM I THEN?  SOME KIND OF TOMBOY? A FLAT-CHESTED KLUTZ?" she snarled.</p><p>For once Genma refused to be  cowed, grimacing in the wake of her rage. "You're a martial artist." He arched  an eyebrow as he looked down at her. "Aren't you?" he added.</p><p>"Of course I am," she huffed.</p><p>"The art does not know genders as  my sons curse has proved." His lips twisted for an instant, but then the sneer  was gone without a trace and he continued with no pause. "If you truly are a  martial artist, then you must act as one, and martial artists train." Genma  fixed her with a hawk-like glare through his spectacles. "Ranma has gone, you  can't hide behind him anymore."</p><p>"I have never hidden behind  anyone," she hissed, her body quivered as her hands clutched at her belt as if  ready to strangle the stocky man with it.</p><p>"Maybe not," he conceded, "But it  was Ranma who fought the battles, not you. The matches you did accept, you  lost, and it was Ranma who regained victory. Not you. This is your dojo, it is  time you defended it." Genma drove the words in like nails.</p><p>"I can defend it just fine," she  protested, but her voice was small and weak, doubts nagging at her mind and  robbing her of her convictions.</p><p>"Maybe you can," Genma shrugged.  "But that's not what anyone else thinks, and that's what really matters, isn't  it?"  His lips curled into a smirk.  "Without Ranma there is very little to stop Shampoo or Ukyo challenging you for  the engagement. Or another dojo destroyer; who wants your sign. They think you  weak and unskilled; they won't even consider you a threat. But I can change  that, with my training they'll know that you're no pushover. They willll  respect your skills and so will Ranma."</p><p>It was the offer she had been  wanting for two years, a chance for someone to acknowledge her as a martial  artist, and not as an observer surrounded and outclassed by her peers. She  longed to be the fighter, not the prize, to fight side by side with a man and  to keep him from harm, rather than being constantly protected or kidnapped, to  finally be known as a warrior, not just a fiancé, to have people come to her  for help rather than only being asked where Ranma was.</p><p>However the offer had come from  Genma Saotome, and though she was fond of her father's friend, the man could  not be trusted.</p><p>"I can handle any challenger,"  she declared proudly. "I don't need your help."</p><p>Genma's glare never wavered. "If  that's true, you have nothing to lose, yet much to gain and much to prove."</p><p>"Nothing to lose, except my  sanity or any liking for cats." she snapped.</p><p>Genma stiffened at her words,  back jerking rigid as his frown deepened. His eyes seemed hollow for a brief  moment, before fires sprang in his irises and his face became harsh like jagged  stone. His jaw tightened but all he asked was a simple, pointed, question.</p><p>"Does the Art mean so little to  you?"</p><p>The question echoed in her mind  like the clang of a thrown gauntlet. Akane forced as much iron as she could  into her brown eyes, willing her gaze into a blade and her expression into hard  granite.</p><p>"When do we start?"</p><p>Genma smiled, but the expression  did not touch his eyes. His stare ran her up and down, appraising every inch of  her. With a smirk he bowed at the waist, a small but profound gesture.</p><p>"Right now," he replied.</p><p>Then the grin dropped from his  lips, and his face became harsh and expressionless. He seemed to radiate an  invisible aura of power, but not the strength or ability that was present  Cologne or Happosai's spirit, or the raw energy of Ranma's ki. This was subtle,  yet intimidating, full of force and command that she never would have expected  to feel in the presence of a coward like Genma. It was the aura of a sensei.</p><p>He pointed to the empty space at  the centre of the training hall, "Show me Naihanchi," he commanded.</p><p>Akane bristled "What? Naihanchi?"</p><p>"Is there a problem?" he asked  firmly, his tone forbidding any answer.</p><p>Akane swallowed her protests,  muffling a growl low in her throat, and stalked to the spot he had indicated  taking up the ready position.</p><p>Naihanchi was the first kata that  was taught to a student of the Anything-Goes after the first month of training.  An ancient form taught in Okinawa, it was part of many styles in some form.  Akane hated it.</p><p>It was short and basic, a mere thirty-six movements, containing no  kicks and the  only simplest blocks and  punches. All of the techniques were performed in the same stance, a low  knock-kneed posture, with the toes pointing in and pelvis raised, which always  forced Akane's buttocks to clench uncomfortably (adding suspicions about why  Happosai had included the kata in his school). The footwork was tedious and  outdated; all robotic sidesteps that was intended to prevent the practitioner  from tripping over his clog-sandals.</p><p>She tugged at her black belt, and  frowned, this kata was beneath her.</p><p>"Wouldn't you rather I did  something more challenging?" she asked. "Like Gojushiho or Buraja-Strappu"  Those were two of her favourite patterns, despite the unfortunate name of the  second one. <i>At least it proves its an Anything-Goes original.</i></p><p>Genma shook his head. "One should begin at the  beginning," he said flatly. "Naihanchi will be fine."</p><p>Akane sighed; she had agreed to  his training, she could not turn back without losing her pride as a martial  artist. She brought her feet together, hands held in front of her waist, left  over right. Breathing in slow and deep she lifted her hands to inscribe a  circle in the air. When her palms met again she lifted them level with her  lips, turning them over so that they were palms down as she pushed them back to  her belt knot. Her head turned sweeping her gaze, first left and then as it  arced to the right she sidestepped quick, crossing one foot in front of the  other, and stuck out hard with a right knife hand blow. Thus the kata began.</p><p>She moved through the pattern  swiftly, her body instinctively going through the motions. Her attacks were  light and fast, flicking out her blocks and punches, the fabric of her gi  snapping faintly. She ended upon the spot from which she started, assuming the  ready position, waiting to begin the next kata.</p><p>Her teacher had not moved, his  face expressionless.</p><p>"Again," he snapped.</p><p>Gulping back a sour grunt, Akane  began again. This time she put greater speed and force into the kata, she  lashed each blow into the air around her, her sleeves cracking like thunder.  She expelled her breath forcefully from her gritted teeth, and yelled her kiai  loud as the force of her elbow strike bore into her palm upon execution.</p><p>Genma remained unimpressed, and  ordered her to repeat the kata twice more. She could understand why, with each  attempt she could feel her movements become more fluid and easy, the repetition  drilling the sequence into her muscles. It was his flat tone and cold stare  that grated upon her nerves; his gaze piercing through every inch of her, as  observant yet as expressionless as a camera. There was something missing, and  only he knew what.</p><p>"Why don't you tell me where I'm  going wrong, rather than continue to waste time? " she snapped as he opened her  mouth to form the command 'again'.</p><p>He grimaced, eyes narrowing  behind his glasses at her outburst</p><p>" I was hoping that you'd work  that out for yourself." The elder Saotome grunted. "True martial arts can not  be spoon fed and I don't intend to tell you everything. Some things you have to  learn on your own."</p><p>Akane's teeth ground, the sound  scraping loudly in her own ears, but remained silent. Genma shifted slight to  the right, and cleared his throat with a pointed, guttural sound.</p><p>"Your stance was too high, and your  balance and rooting suffered. Your breathing was harsh and unnatural, and your  movements were tense and robotic. You tightened your muscles to add force yet  lost your grace." Each complaint was fuel to Akane's fire. Her fists were  white, quivering as Genma tore her performance apart.</p><p>"There was  some improvement as you repeated the kata, so I believe that those faults can  be phased out by more practise." he said with a sigh, before fixing her with as  intense glower. "However there was something lacking in your efforts, something  that was missing from the kata every time.</p><p>"<i>Kime</i>: focus!</p><p>"There was no urgency to your  technique, no feeling. You performed the kata like a dance not as a martial  art. You acted like a programmed machine, simply going through the motions  completely devoid of any meaning or intent. Each of your moves, were the  motions of a cobra without its venom, you hissed and bit but there was no  danger, no desire to defeat your opponent, no threat."</p><p>"What opponent, its just a kata."  Akane snorted, unable to keep silent. "And a basic one at that."</p><p>Genma recoiled as if struck, head  jerking and eyes wide. Then his jaw tightened and his eyes became sharp steel  behind the lenses of his glasses. "Just a kata?" he hissed, sounding  scandalised as if someone had suggested he get a job. "Just a kata?" he  repeated, voice rising as his face reddened.</p><p>Akane said nothing but met his  anger with her a defiant glare.</p><p>"Kata are the basis of martial  arts." Genma declared. "Each individual pattern describes an entire method of  combat, displaying the use of the most effective techniques honed after  centuries of training."</p><p>"Yeah, centuries." Akane spat  dryly. "Kata are outdated, I don't wear stupid clogs so why do I need to learn  to fight in them."</p><p>"That just demonstrates how  little you know, girl" he said in acid tones, his lips curling into a smirk.  Akane could not stop her lips peeling back as she growled.</p><p>"Since I doubt you trust my years  of experience, enough to believe what I say." Genma proclaimed loftily. "I  suppose I will have to teach you by example."</p><p>The stocky man sank into the  Naihanchi stance, legs twisted inwards so that his knees faced each other and  his feet formed a triangle with his toes pointing at the apex. His ample weight  pressed through his legs making a solid foundation like the base of a pyramid.  His fists rested against his waist, spreading out his broad shoulders as his  swollen paunch heaved over his belt knot.</p><p>To Akane that stomach was a  bright, red bulls eye.</p><p>"Well," he grunted. "Show me I'm  wrong." The challenge in his voice was unmistakable.</p><p>With a wordless kiai Akane shot  forwards over the small space that separated her from the Saotome master. Her  foot snapped out with a kick, the ball of her foot shooting towards Genma's  bulging gut. The attack found only air as he stepped forwards, twisting  sideways and blading his body towards her as the kick flew past. Still pushing  forwards she used her momentum by following up with a hard right punch. He  deflected and caught her thrusting fist easily with his rear hand before  countering. She grunted as a harsh blow jarred her collarbone. Hissing through  gritted teeth as pain shot along the marrow she could not hope to defend as he  grabbed her roughly by the scruff of her gi, other hand fastening on to her  lapel, and flung her unceremoniously to the mat.</p><p>Akane landed upon her side with a  groan, the fall stealing her wind. Glaring up at her opponent, she saw him  mimic the defence he had just used. She was shocked yet not surprised to  recognise the movements as from the Naihanchi kata. It was not exactly the  same, he had used the protruding bone of his wrist to strike her collarbone and  not his knife hand, and had neglected the elbow smash; however the technique  had still used the same motions, and in a way she had never seen before.<i>  That can be used as a throw?</i> she thought as she recalled his use for what  to her had seemed a punch.</p><p>Pulling herself to a sitting  position, and rubbing furtively at her shoulder joint, she scowled at Genma.</p><p>"That was a one-shot trick," she  snorted.</p><p>The older man arched a  questioning eyebrow. "You really think so?" he asked in a dry tone.</p><p>Akane had no reply, and so  continued to stare daggers at the man from the floor, almost daring him to mock  her further. He did not, instead joining her on the tatami, crossing his legs  as he sat and watching her with an intense, hawk-like glare. The soft, long  shadows of the dawn light began to dance upon the dojo walls as the sun climbed  into the sky.</p><p>"Do you know why Naihanchi is the  first kata taught in the Anything-goes school?" he asked after a while.</p><p>Surprised by the sudden question  Akane frowned. Genma waited silently, face firm and without expression. There  was no sign of it being a trick question, and the silence was beginning to hang  in the air, so she answered as she had been taught.</p><p>"It is a simple pattern which  provides a good introduction to kata and its concepts, and builds a solid  foundation in the basic blocks and punches while developing a strong, balanced  stance." Her chin rose proudly as she waited for Genma's reply and rebuttal.</p><p>The large man tilted his head,  eyes rolling upwards behind his glasses as if trying to see his own brain. He  made a small, thoughtful sound, a low mumble before shaking his head as his  eyes locked upon her through hooded lids.</p><p>"No, those are benefits of the  training certainly, but not its true purpose."</p><p>Akane grimaced, she had expected  a sour reply, and received far better than she had expected from Ranma's stern  father, but the logic and plain tone of the response still rankled.</p><p>"Then enlighten me," she snorted.</p><p>"As I have already said, each  kata represents a complete method of fighting. Naihanchi is the perfect  introduction to the Art as it contains very simple techniques, which present the  novice with the fundamental principles behind combat. The movements of the kata  are basic yet effective enough to teach the new student how to defend  themselves against untrained attackers. They contain the key strategies that  form the foundation of future skills employed against skilled Artists. The kata  even contains advanced manoeuvres and tactics such as carefully aimed strikes  to vital part of the body and joint manipulation, as I have shown you." He  stared pointedly at her hand as it clasped her collarbone. It blazed with the  reminder and she rubbed at it gently, sure that it would bruise nastily.</p><p>"But the kata is so short," she  said weakly, confusion and doubt leeching at her tone. "How can it include so  much?"</p><p>Genma smirked knowingly. "The  written word can be small, and books short, but they can still inspire great  things. The discs that Nabiki carries for her computer appear small, but I'm  told that they hold a great deal of data. Kata is just another form of storing  information, a great deal of it, and compressing it so that it may be easily  learned. It is not the movement or the techniques that hold the knowledge but  the theories behind them. All you see are the movements, a punch there, a kick  here, you must look beyond that and ask yourself, <i>would that work in a real  fight?</i> <i>Would it be effective?</i> If the answer is yes, then ask  yourself <i>why is it effective? </i>Was it the stance you use, the part of the  hand you hit with, where you would aim the strike, how you moved before the  strike?"</p><p>"And if the answer is no?"</p><p>He shrugged, "Then the movement  is not what you thought it was? If it its not a punch perhaps it's a grab for a  throw. Sometimes the creators of a kata hid the true intent of their movements,  so that idle observers would not know the techniques."</p><p>"Then how did they expect their  students to understand?" Akane asked with an angry grunt.</p><p>"Kata are made by warriors for  warriors. A martial artist should understand the true meaning of the kata  instinctively."</p><p>His expression was still black  and stony, but Akane could feel the challenge in his words, knew it from the  probe of his gaze.  <i>A martial artist  should…</i>he had said, questioning her abilities again. Everyone forever  doubted her training, mocking it. , Her fists quivered in her laps as she  clenched them tighter. She would show him, she would master the kata.</p><p>"The movements of Naihanchi is a  whole fighting system," he continued, "and like all systems it has a strategy,  a plan of attack with which to gain victory. Master that strategy and you can  apply it to any technique, you can make it your own. That is the heart of the  Anything-goes school."</p><p>Akane felt her own chin rise at  the pride that gilded the man's tone. The school was everything to him. She  felt the stirring of her own ardour, yet stuffed it down and continued to probe  Genma's knowledge.</p><p>"So why is Naihanchi so  important?" she asked. "What is its great strategy?"</p><p>Genma scowled in what seemed to  be irritation at her question. "Think about it, girl," he grunted harshly. "It  is obvious by its very name. Naihanchi does exactly what it says on the tin."</p><p>Her jaw tightened as she  bristled, but she fought to maintain her fragile composure, lips compressing to  a firm line as she swallowed an enraged yell.</p><p>Her mind set to unravelling his  clue. <i>It's name?</i> Naihanchi meant 'to stand upon uneven ground.' She felt  her bows furrow as she frowned, it told her nothing. Running through the kata  in her head, she summoned a mental picture of her father demonstrating the form  to three little girls in crisp white gi. Akane remembered watching her father  move, while her older sisters looked on beside her, Kasumi with a patient  smile, and Nabiki with undisguised disinterest. Her own eyes must have been  wide as she recalled studying his every, graceful motion in enthralled detail,  her heart panged by wonder. Her youthful awe served her well, as her father's  movements replayed in her mind, like the screening of an old silent movie. Then  the answer blossomed for her, a muted buzz that was soon ringing loud and the  within her brain.</p><p><i>To stand!... The stance!</i></p><p>The penny dropped with a clunk as she were a vending  machine, the solution tumbling out of her as fast as her mouth could give the  words form.</p><p>"Naihanchi uses a low, stable  stance and small movements so that the martial artist would not lose his  balance and fall when attacked upon or rough or jagged battlefield. That's the  Art," she cried.</p><p>If she had given such a confident  response to her father, his thin face would have split from ear-to-ear as a  proud grin beamed through his moustache. Genma merely nodded.</p><p>"That is right," he said flatly.  "It is believed that Naihanchi was developed from techniques and tactics  adapted when fighting on the raised ground between the flooded paddy that were  common in southern China and Okinawa."</p><p>Akane drew breath to contest the  use of such methods, but Genma overrode her before she could speak.</p><p>"Before you start whining about  the lack of rice fields in Nerima, the story merely explains the inspiration  for the kata, not its uses."</p><p>Akane scowled at the use of the  word whine and at being cut off, while Genma adjusted his glasses before  resuming.</p><p>"The fighting method described by  Naihanchi is a form of defensive combat that its fought in close quarters with  an attacker. It uses simple blocks and body positioning to deflect an attack  without needing large leaps and dodges. The small side steps bring the user  within the enemies guard, while slipping around or parrying any attack with  little effort. Then the opponent is dispatched with simple, but effective close  range strike such as hook punches and uppercuts to vital areas, as you no doubt  recognise in the movements of the kata. You experienced the effectiveness of  this technique when you tried to hit me."</p><p>That was some understatement, and  only now could she see the genius of his defence. He had knocked her kick aside  without even shifting his stance and then evaded her punch by turning his body  sideways and removing her target area. By stepping across he had then slipped  too close for her to cover his return attack. It was brilliant, and almost to  hard to believe that such an art was contained within the simple kata she had  dismissed as the stuff of novices.</p><p>"However," Genma continued, his  voice growing louder for a moment to bring her from her thoughts. "At such  close quarters, it is very easy and probable for you foe to seize hold of you  or your clothes and try to wrestle you to the floor. Which is why the stance is  very stable and rooted, and the kata include escapes from such grabs, and takedowns  of its own that can be used in such situations.</p><p>"This method of fighting is  perfect for beginners who have not yet acquired the skill to block and dodge  attacks effectively, as well as experienced warriors who specialise in such  tactics. In fact this kata contains so much information for such fighters, both  in the many interpretations of its movements and variations of its principle  that it has been said that it would take a lifetime to truly master. But I  think I've managed it." A small ghost of a small curved the elder Saotome's  lips.</p><p>Akane stubbornly refused to be  drawn in. "If that's true then why do you not use it?" she asked, arching her  eyebrow in lofty curiosity. "If you have mastered the way of fighting with  little movements, then why do you and Ranma leap around on the roof like rabid  bullfrogs?" She was surprised to hear her voice harden, it was not as if she  wanted to copy them.</p><p>"That is more the boy's fault  than mine," he said with a sour grimace. "I taught the boy the kata, in fact I  taught him nothing else for the first two years that I trained him." He kept on  talking despite the dropping of Akane's jaw. "The boy learnt the kata and its  secrets well enough, but he lacked my hearty constitution-"</p><p>"You mean your fat," she broke in  earning a sharp glare from the large man. Her lips twitched as she fought to  keep a straight face.</p><p>"As I was saying," he said  firmly, scowling at her. "Ranma lacked my <i>constitution</i>-" he repeated,  biting out the word for emphasis "-and could not bring out the full potential  of the method. So I wisely began stressing jumps and sweeping dodges and other  evasive tactics to enable him to weave between attacks and out-manoeuvre much  stronger opponents with subtle body movements. I had to use such method when I sparred  with him, at first to make him aware of the techniques so that he could adopt  them himself, and then to keep up with him. The Naihanchi style of fighting is  defensive and if I tried it the cocky brat would just walk off and wait it  out." The clenching of Genma's teeth and the balling of his fists told Akane  what the father thought of his son's counter-strategy.</p><p>"Nonetheless," he said after a  moment. "I still made Ranma perform the Naihanchi, again and again, night and  day, until I was satisfied that he truly understood it. When he was fourteen he  proved he did by creating his own variant of the kata, changing the techniques  and adapting the principles to suit his own, more mobile form of martial arts.  He called it Maihanchi."</p><p>"Ranma created his own kata,"  Akane cried, impressed and incensed both at once.</p><p>"Not created but modified it to  his needs, as the heir of the Anything-goes school should. However he was only  fourteen, and it takes a high level of mastery to do such a thing."</p><p>"I thought you said Naihanchi  would take a lifetime to master?" Akane muttered dryly.</p><p>Genma glowered at her. "I did not  say that, someone else did. Hironori Otsuka, a renowned karate master. But he  was not on the Anything-goes school level and he did not know Ranma." The last  part was added in a quiet murmur; whether in pride, sorrow, or jealously; Akane  could not tell.</p><p>"I thought that it was a taboo to  change the old kata, at least that's what Dad always said." Akane frowned; much  of what her father had taught her was beingcalled into doubt by what her new  teacher had said. "He said that kata served as a link to the traditions and  spirits of the past masters."</p><p>Genma chuckled, "That sounds like  something that Soun would say." A smile began to creep upon his lips. "Tell me,  did he also say that kata was a form of meditation that taught spiritual focus  not combat, or something like that?"</p><p>Akane's eyes widened and her  mouth hung open. She nodded wordlessly, her father had indeed told her that,  using the same words.</p><p>The chuckles turned into  full-blown guffaws, Genma pressing his hands to his belly. "Same old Soun," he  managed between laughs. His shoulders shook as he chortled, and Akane growled.</p><p>"What are you laughing at?" she  challenged. "My father is a great martial artist."</p><p>The laughter stopped dead and  Genma's nostalgic smile dropped grumbled from his face. "Indeed he is," the man  said gravely. "But not as good as he could have been," he added in a soft  voice. By his downcast eyes and quiet tone, he seemed to be mourning something.  Something lost to the past.</p><p>His gaze then rose to meet  Akane's eyes, watching her for a long, silent moment as his expression of  sorrow hardened to granite, but his eyes remained hollow.</p><p>"I was not mocking your father,  Akane. I trained with the man for years, suffered the Master's trials with him,  and I know him better than anyone. He used to say the same thing, back then  when we practised the kata together."</p><p>Genma drew a deep breath and his  eyes became unfocussed, as if looking at something distant; looking through the  doors of time.</p><p>"Your father has always been a  skilled martial artist, passionate about the Art and his training. That is why,  like myself, he was chosen by the legendary Happosai to be his pupil." The old  fighter's brow furrowed, as if remembering an unsolved puzzle from the past,  returned to haunt him.</p><p>"Though the two of us trained  intensively, both determined to become masters of the Arts, in many ways we  were as different as night an day. Orphaned as a child I chose the warrior path  for myself, to honour my ancestors. You father was pushed into it by family  obligation as the heir of the Tendo line. It was in fact his own father who had  sent him to learn from the Master."</p><p>"Are you saying that Dad never  wanted to be a martial artist?" Akane scoffed.</p><p>"I'm saying he never chose the  path himself," Genma replied with a grimace. "It worked out for the best, since  as I said your father loved the Art, but in a way so very different for my own  fervour. A way that, to the Master, was lacking."</p><p>"What way?" Akane inquired  tightly.</p><p>"For your father, the martial  arts were never about fighting, but rather about the perfection and health of  the body, mind and spirit. He lacked the spark of a warrior, the desire to test  one's strength and skill in battle, the spark that so defines people such as my  son. It was the art not the combat that he found most satisfying. For Soun  exercises such a sparring were a way to strengthen his body, and kata was  merely a way to focus the mind and synchronise breathing. Where I sought the  deeper meanings of the forms, the principles and techniques of combat, to him  the perfect performance of a kata was an end to itself."</p><p>Akane glared through the corners  of her eyes. "Are you saying that my father, could not fight, that he was a  coward?" she asked with menacing softness.</p><p>"Of course not," he protested  loudly. "When it was time to fight, your father was deadly, a good man to have  with you in a scrape." By his tone of voice and from what she knew of the man  before her, Akane could tell that such scrapes were frequent. "However he would  only fight as a last resort, if there was no other way. Often he broke up the  brawls before they started by scaring his foes away with his aura, which is how  he developed the Demon Head attack that he used so much on my son."</p><p>Akane wanted to contest the  explanation behind her father's technique, but it was far too logical. Instead  she challenged another part of the story.</p><p>"If he was such a good fighter  why do you think that he could be better?"</p><p>Genma sighed. "The same reason he  never teaches or practises the art any more, and why he can be so emotional;  the same reason for a hundred other regrets for both of us. The Master."</p><p>"What does the old fart have to  do with it?"</p><p>"Soun's beliefs worked in counter  to the Master and his training, and so his skills never blossomed under  Happosai's tutelage." He pushed his spectacles further up on the bridge of his  nose, pausing to rub at his eyes. "I know very little about the Master's  unnaturally long life, but I do know that it was hard and painful. For that is  the core of the old man's convictions, and the driving concept behind the  training in the Anything-Goes School of Martial Arts: to become stronger  through adversity.</p><p>"However your father ambitions did  not involve becoming stronger or more skilled than others, and so what to the  master was training may have been torture to Soun. It did make him a skilled  and powerful martial artist, but it weakened him in other ways. I think that it  was harder on him than me."</p><p>That was a shockingly  out-of-character confession for the old panda. After a lingering sigh, and a  slow shake of his head Genma added, "If it were not for your mother, I'm not  sure how he would have survived."</p><p>"My mother?" Akane gasped.</p><p>Genma stiffened at the question,  seemingly regretting having spoken, and then he grimaced. "When we were young  men, your father and I, not much older than you are now, I began to notice the  stain the training was putting on Soun. He was becoming withdrawn and melancholy,  not the weeping that he does now, but a more private brooding. His skills began  to suffer, his heart was a never in our spars and he did little else but his  kata, seeking peace in the movements. Hoping to cheer my friend up, I asked  Nodoka, who had recently come into our lives like a bolt of lightning, to  introduce Soun to her friend Kimiko." He sighed and shook his head, a small  smile curving his mouth. " It was one of the best things I ever did."</p><p><i>Well there, can't be much  competition in the good deed department, </i>Akane thought bitterly, but  remained silent.</p><p>"Soun fell head over heels for  her, and was soon back to his old self, full of vigour. Love has those sort of  strange effects," his tone became reflective and he gave Akane a sidelong  glance; that made her suspicious of his the meaning behind that look.</p><p>"Your mother was a very modern  minded person, educated in tradition but not obsessed with it like my own  paramour. She was always looking forwards to the future; and that suited Soun  just fine. Your mother was also trained in the martial arts, having studied  Kyudo, the way of the bow. To her, as to your father, the martial arts were a  spiritual path, the combative side a ghost of the past. Your mother believed  that the time of challenges and duels between martial artists was gone, and  that the future place of the art was in teaching respect and humility to a new  generation. Which is why when your father and I 'ended' our apprenticeship with  the Master, he settle down with Kimiko to raise a family and to teach the  Anything-goes school as an art form, thus the Tendo-ryu was formed. I did not  have the patience for such things, I wanted to perfect and hone my fighting  prowess and test it against the best, so after finally marrying Nodoka and  securing the future of our clans by a betrothal oath, I set off on my own  training voyage.</p><p>"It was over three years later  that Soun and I were reunited. Nodoka had recently told me that she was  expecting our first child, and bowled over by this announcement, I decided to  seek out your father and his advice. I was not surprised to find my old friend  so settled and so happy; with Nabiki a new born baby, Kasumi a toddler, a dojo  full of students and the respect of the town, Soun had done very well for  himself.</p><p>"Despite his happiness, Soun's  skills had grown stagnant. He had long ago defeated those who would question  his right to teach and had formed a modified syllabus of the Anything-goes  style, which was aimed at fitness and self-defence. He had turned the drilling  of techniques into an exercise of focus and strength. Sparring was regulated by  rules adopted from kick-boxing and full contact karate. The kata were  meditation instead of manuals of deadly techniques. I did not question his  methods, it was his dojo, but when I did once ask him about it all he did was  chuckle 'That's the way of things now Saotome,' he said."</p><p>Genma swallowed and then shook  his head slowly, his eyes downcast as he stared at the floor mats. "He missed  his potential, such a waste. And when Kimiko died…"he left the statement  unfinished, hanging in the air.</p><p>"You sound like you're sad for  him?" Akane said softly, unused to sorrow from the man only fake, panda tears,</p><p>"Perhaps," he said quietly. His  eyes were hidden behind the glare from the now risen sun, meagre light filling  the sky beneath a veil of grey clouds. She saw his lips moved barely as he  mumbled something beneath his breath. Akane strained to hear it.</p><p>"Perhaps I'm sad for myself."</p><p>Suddenly he lunged forwards,  leaning close to her with his hand pressed against the floor and his eyes  drilling into hers from mere inches away. Akane recoiled at his abrupt motion,  one arm rising in a defensive gesture as she arched back away from his cold  stare.</p><p>"But you're different Akane," he  said softly.</p><p>"I am?" she spluttered weakly.</p><p>Genma nodded and moved back,  sliding back into his stiff seated position.</p><p>"You have the spark that your  father never did. I can feel it."</p><p>"I do?"</p><p>"Yes that is why smash bricks  instead of easing your stress through the kata as your father taught you. Why  you charged into the horde of perverted boys at your school gates instead of  letting them come to you and defending, or just reporting them.</p><p>"You have a fire inside you that  makes you want to lash out at things, to show yourself you are better than  them." He grimaced as he sat back on his haunches. "At present that fire is  wild and untamed, wasted."</p><p>Akane opened her mouth but Genma  raised a hand, which seemed to steal he protest before she could word it. Biting  her lip she waited for him to continue.</p><p>"Practising the martial arts is  like the forging of a fine sword. First good, hard metal is needed. Your father  had that, but he did not have the fire needed for the forging. You possess that  fire, but the flames must be focussed and controlled to form the blade. And  then the skills must be honed and sharpened, a process that will last your  entire life, during each battle, after each…."</p><p>"Enough with the metaphor Uncle  Saotome, you're not sounding any wiser." Akane broke in, tired of his drawn out  rant.</p><p>Genma's lips tightened to a  frown, but his cheeks did redden slightly and his eyes focussed upon his  fingers at the picked at an imaginary thread in his gi.</p><p>" What you're saying is that you  want to make me a better martial artist."</p><p>The large man snorted. "Not just  better, girl, one of the best. Remember the battle suit that showed your true  potential, your power. I can bring that out. Bring it under your control, not  that of magic. With your fire and my excellent and flawless tutelage, you could  become a warrior with a reputation to shake all of Japan. You would be better  than Kodachi, better than the Amazon…better than…"</p><p>"Better than Ranma?" Akane burst in. She did not  know where that had come from; the words had just ripped themselves from her  chest. She could feel her heart pound as she waited for his response, balling  her hands into her gi to stop them shaking. Her mouth had gone dry. <i>What's  wrong with me? </i>she asked herself. Confusion began to cloud her brain, yet  she her body was still tensed in readiness for his answer.  </p><p>A wide grin  almost split Genma's face in two. "That depends on you," he said with a shrug.  "Are you willing to give your heart and body? Everything you have? To treat me as  your sensei? To do what I ask no matter how hard or what sacrifices you make?"</p><p>Akane's own pulse seemed to beat in her skull like a  drum. She knew what Genma was like, the cat-fist, the fiancés and the thefts.  Could she trust herself to his training? Would it change her? He offered the  respect she knew she craved, a chance to stand up out of Ranma's shadow and be  counted as a warrior in her own right. A chance to be the hero and no longer  the damsel in distress. However the price would be high, maybe too high.</p><p>The image of her and Ranma side-by-side flashed in  her mind, fighting together, each watching the other's back; the dangers they  faced binding them together.</p><p><i>To fight along side Ranma, as his equal. Is that  what I want?</i></p><p>Then came the memory of kneeling upon Ranma's beaten  form posing victoriously in her battle-suit, having mopped the floor with her  previously untouchable fiancé. This time it would be her, not the suits  knowledge using her body. Her own talent harnessed through her own efforts, would  defeat him.</p><p><i>To be better than Ranma, is that what I want?</i></p><p>Whatever her  heart desires, it had cast the dice and the path was chosen. Her life changed  as the lines of destiny morphed to form her fate.</p><p>"When do we start, Sensei?" she asked, chest  swelling.</p><p>Genma smirked. "We already have, girl. We already  have."</p><p>An ocean of grey clouds formed a low canopy above  the leafy evergreens and bare branches of the trees that grew stubbornly down  the face of Mount Emei. Thick forests spread to the horizon, forming hazy  shadows as they descended into the mists that swarmed around the peaks. Ancient  paths wound amongst the crags and, linking the ledges with steps of smooth  white stone, worn and bowed after century upon century of humble monks and holy  pilgrims.</p><p>The wooden boards of the small bridge rattled  beneath Brand's heels as he strode across the small brook. Water fell along the  jagged rocks in a series of minor falls, rushing and burbling as it slid down  the mountain in white, foamy streams.</p><p>The sweet scent of burning incense wafted into his  nostrils, telling him that he was close. He followed the path as it followed  the earth, twisting sharply around the mountainside, the rock wall seeming to  slide away as he advanced.</p><p>Across the blanket of fog stood a stone ledge,  appearing to float in the mist like a spire of dark rock. Shrouded behind a  curtain of fog and the leaves of mighty evergreens that jutted from the  mountains the platform seemed magical, as if formed from the solidifying haze  as it grew and expanded from the air. The sun was weak in the sky, yet the  light still seemed to glimmer gently across the tiles of the small shrine  standing upon the ledge. Carved and gilded pillars held the curved roof aloft  above an ornate wooden altar; paper charms and bright petals arranged on the  many levels amongst the fragrant sticks of burning incense. Above the altar  loomed an idol carved in the image of a man with a painted face like a  thunderhead and a broad, forked beard. Brand could just make out the twisted  scowl of the scarlet lips, and glowering eyes of polished jade.</p><p>His hand lashed out like a blur, snatching the  golden leaf from flight -a last remnant of the recent fall, lashed at his face  by a wild gust of wind that had risen abruptly from the once still air. His  fingers tightened, capturing the leaf in a tight fist as his lips twitched in a  momentary frown. That had been no natural wind. With a sigh he opened his hand  and let a small stream of black dust trail from his fingertips on another  sudden breeze.</p><p>He brushed away the remaining ash against the long  tail of his red coat, careful not to mar any of the intricate embroidery of  gilded thread that was woven in exquisite patterns across the garment. The  working of gold thorns wound over his sleeves and shoulders, the scene  culminating in the vivid portrait of a swooping hawk with wings of silver fire  and eyes of scarlet flame.</p><p>The wind whipped into another frenzy, the squall  tossing his hair into disarray. With a grimace he raked a hand through the  dark, red curls sweeping them into a rough order as he glowered across at the  ledge at what he knew to be the source of the angry blasts of air.</p><p>The girl danced in wide circles upon the eight  wooden posts that formed a large ring under the lightning gaze of the furious  idol. A tail of long blonde hair trailed behind her, swinging and thrashing  with her movements as she stepped from pole to pole effortlessly. Her eyes  stared keenly a head as she moved with fluid grace, seeming to glide  flawlessly. Her hands were in constant motion, open palms swaying and shifting  before striking out at the centre of her circle. Always at the centre. The  circle was her world and her life, and the centre its heart, its core, where  all the energy of the universe was gathered, and could be seized.</p><p>Walking to the edge of the mountain, he gazed  downwards along its steep banks. In the mist the forests and rivers below were  blurry, like scenes in a watercolour painting. He squatted onto his haunches,  plucking idly at a tenacious tuft of grass that grew doggedly at a crack it the  rocks.</p><p>Blasting against the mountainside with his leg, he  heaved himself into the air. For the beating of a heart he was souring through  the hazy sky, the air rushing with his pulse in his ears. Then he came roughly  upon firm earth once again, dropping into a crouch and absorbing the sudden  force of his landing.</p><p>He could feel the satisfied smirk crawl onto his  lips as he stood, hands brushing imaginary dust and smoothing non-existent  wrinkles from his clothes.</p><p>"You do know there is a bridge?" a voice asked  dryly.</p><p>Brand turned to the blonde girl who had ceased in  her frantic, spiral waltz and now stood frowning with arms folded beneath hers  breasts. Her stance was arrow straight, heels together and maintaining perfect  posture while balanced effortlessly upon the narrow cap of one of the poles.  Despite the odd scenario she managed to present a prime picture of female  disapproval.</p><p>He shrugged, "It's good exercise."</p><p>Willow snorted.</p><p>"Everything should be taken as training, dear little  sister." He smiled as the title made her grimace. "Every opportunity to improve  should be taken and not just the times when you are feeling grumpy." He  gestured at the ring of wooden posts.</p><p>"What makes you think I'm grumpy?" she sneered.</p><p>"The mini-typhoon that appeared out of thin and  formerly quiet air," he answered with a quirk of his eyebrow.</p><p>"Don't exaggerate. That was nothing like a typhoon."</p><p>Brand cocked his head to one side as he glanced at  her with a raised eyebrow. "There should have been no wind at all. You should  have more control than that."</p><p>Willow frowned at him. "You can hardly lecture <i>anyone</i>  on a lack of control Brand." She lifted an admonishing finger skyward, "People  in glass houses shouldn't play with fire."</p><p>Brand's lips twisted into a harsh scowl at the  comment. He had walked into that one.</p><p>"We are not talking about me, Willow, "he huffed.</p><p>"That tapestry you torched <i>was </i>very valuable.  Priceless you might say. A gift from the Emperor, in days the mountain would  strain to recall." Her smirk was venomous.</p><p>His jaw tightened. "You're never going to let that  one go, are you?" he said through gritted teeth. "No matter how much time  passes?"</p><p>"There has been much more than one incident, dear  brother." She replied in a voice full of sickly saccharine. "That was just the  first to cross my mind." She placed her index finger to her chin in an  exaggerated gesture of contemplation. "There was also the time when you  shattered Blitz's favourite mirror after he split coffee on your shirt. And  the…"</p><p>"I did not come here to talk about me," he  interjected with a roar.</p><p>Her smile vanished. "That's the point Brand. You  were so busy offering hypocritical crap, you haven't told me what you have come  for."</p><p>His mouth worked, ready to yell back a reply, but with  clenched fists and deep breaths he brought himself under control. There were  more important matters.</p><p>"Cloud wants to talk to you. He feels that yesterdays  incident should be discussed in greater detail."</p><p>Willow's eyes narrowed. With a muted growl she spun on  her heel, stomping towards the misty silhouette of a bridge enshrouded by fog.  Frowning Brand followed her.</p><p>"Acting a little melodramatic aren't we?" he called after  her.</p><p>He received no verbal reply yet he saw her muscles tense  slightly, as she continued to stride away with her back to him. Sighing he  increased his pace so that he could fall in beside her as she reached the  bridge. She glared at him from the corner of her eyes as he came up beside her,  but said nothing. Her heels thundered upon the rickety wooden planks with each  step, making the slender path sway precariously on its worn, wooden suspension.</p><p>"You never used  to take losing so badly," he muttered.</p><p>He caught the incoming back fist at the wrist without  breaking his stride. Raising an eyebrow he glanced sidelong at his assailant,  who glared daggers at back at him. He released her arm and she resumed stalking  away.</p><p>"You just don't understand Brand."</p><p>Brand stared after her, watching her tail of golden hair  sway between her shoulder blades as she marched. After a moment he followed  after her with brows lowered, lengthening his strides to fall in beside her.</p><p>"Does this have something to do with that <i>boy</i>?" he  felt his lips twist on the last word.</p><p>Willow frowned. "You mean Ryoga?"</p><p>"I don't care about his name," Brand snapped.</p><p>"Well, I do."</p><p>"That's what I'm afraid of." He grumbled.</p><p>Brand continued walking for another three paces before he  realised that the girl had stopped. Turning around he saw his sister glowering,  her arms folded and foot tapping with rapid percussion.</p><p>"Please tell me we're not going to do the over-protective  brother act?" she said dryly.</p><p>"You know what these foreigners are like, especially the men."  He griped. "They have no values, especially when here. They just want to get  lucky with some naïve girl and brag about it to their friends over beer and  burgers."</p><p>"That's a rather paranoid view, besides Ryoga's not like  that. He's too shy. He looked about to have an embolism when I said he had nice  muscles," Her lips twitched as she clearly fought a reminiscent grin.</p><p>Brand could hear his teeth grinding upon each other. <i>And  just how did she get to see his MUSCLES! </i>he mentally screamed. <i>That  guy's dead, </i>he swore, balling his hands into fist.</p><p>"I can take care of myself Brand," she said as she  resumed her angry pace along the worn stone paths. "And I am not a <i>naïve  girl</i>," she added venomously.</p><p>"You forget yourself, Willow," he called after her, "and  your duty!"</p><p>The girl whirled to face him in a flurry of back silk and  golden tresses. Her face was red and her eyes emerald eyes flared beneath her  bangs, her lips warped as she snarled,</p><p>"My duty has <i>nothing  </i>to do with whom I choose as friends, <i>Lord</i> Brand," she spat. Spinning  on her heel she stalked around a bend in the mountain and took the ancient  stairs two at a time. The canopy of elm branches that hung overhead shook and  waved in sudden sharp gusts.</p><p>Grimacing Brand followed, choosing to remain two paces  behind his sister, watching her fume from a safe distance.</p><p>As he climbed the  age-smoothed steps his home became slowly revealed at the crest of the widening  stairway. The temple clung to face of the mountain, the furthest buildings  vanishing into the thickening mist. The wild trees that ascended with him  stopped; as platform gardens rose in layers alongside the steps, nature became  tamed into small tress and shrubs that grew amidst white rocks in a tranquil  miniature forest.</p><p>The green tiles of the great halls many curved roofs,  moistened by the recent rains to the colour of dew-laden grass, rose before  him. The gilded carvings along the arching spires protruding from the roofs and  the mighty pillars were just visible.</p><p>Brand crested the stairs and passed beneath the gateway,  the scarlet doors swung wide in welcome. He followed Willow across the bridge  of milky stone that spanned a wide moat of silent, still water; it's surface  perfectly tranquil with the faintest layers of winters frost. The bridge's  rails were held up by a legion of stone fists punching from the stone path, and  stretched between posts of flickering lanterns.</p><p>A young student, a plump boy with thinning hair and cold  reddened cheeks swept at the polished tiles before the central shrine, back  hunching from the cold as he laboured beneath a wooden arch supported by red  pillars traced with running spirals. On their approach he immediately his broom  halted, and he bowed low towards them.   Willow  stormed past as if he were made of air. With a splutter he glanced towards  Brand who inclined his head slowly, with a muffled squeak the boy returned the  bow from the waist.</p><p>His sister took the path that cornered around the shrine,  passing beneath its bowed roof, her heels clicking upon the red tiles. Brand  followed, now hearing the rush of the mountain falls, where frothy white water  streamed from and down the harsh rock face to join the harmonious moat, with  only the barest of ripples sliding along the calm surface.</p><p>Behind the shrine the paths diverged leading to more  winding stairways, more ornate buildings or through more gardens and bridges  across gentle green waters as they climbed higher up Mount Emei, becoming ever  more shrouded in veils of grey mist and white clouds.</p><p>Straight ahead was a flat courtyard of many stones, the  irregular shapes and varied of colours pounded in to a smooth floor of blurry,  golden yellow. In the centre a small group of people, young and old, moved  slowly across the dusty stone, small clouds of worn rock kicked up by their  swinging, sliding steps. They only wore thin vests and pants with feet bare.  Their hands moved gently through the form, copying the young adept as he  demonstrated before the steps of the Grand Chamber. His flowing movement were  ruined by a jarring start, his head flashed around to fix upon Willow's  incoming form.</p><p>"Halt," he yelled.</p><p>The students in the courtyard froze, their movements  ceasing in an instant as if time had suddenly stopped. Each student hung poised  and motionless in the same one legged crane stance they had slid into at the  moment of their instructor's barked order.</p><p>"Hail Lord Brand and Lady Willow," he called bowing  towards the named two as they moved towards him.</p><p>The stamping of lowered feet echoed in the mountain like  a thunderclap, the students dropping from their stances with military  precision. Feet together and with iron stiff postures the assembled trainees  brought their hands over their heart, the knuckles of the right fist pressed  into the left palm and bowed, the lowering of heads passing like waves on the  sea.</p><p>With a start and what seemed to be a barely suppressed  humph his sister raised her own hands to return the salutation, barely forming  the gesture before continuing her speedy path towards the Grand Hall.</p><p>Brand watched her behaviour with a tight-lipped frown,  before acknowledging the students salute with his own, perhaps a little more  ostentatiously than usual. He nodded towards the instructor, and the lesson  immediately resumed, the young man leading his charges through the first  movements of the form.</p><p>He weaved in between the people and across the courtyard,  the students almost leaping from his path, making the effort to avoid them  minimal.</p><p>The young instructor halted in his lesson to allow  his sister's passage as she alighted the three stone steps before the Hall,  stepping to the side before turning to seize of hold of the large bars that  were fixed across the mighty steel doors.</p><p>At twice his height they towered above Brand, the  red panels of the doors embossed with magnificent animal motifs, formed from  precious metals and gems, the yellow light from the hanging lanterns glimmering  across the dragon's jade scales and sparkled upon the lion's red-gold mane. The  flickering shadows made the creatures seem to move with the life implied by  their exquisite carving.</p><p>With a great metallic rasp the doors swung open, the  instructor's muscles bunching beneath his thin vest as he heaved the upon the  metal bars and pried open the Grand Hall. Brand sped up to follow Willow into  the tower, once inside he gestured to the youth with a wave of his hand and the  doors were pushed shut behind him.</p><p>A giant before plain, wooden panels of the next  doorway, the lantern light reduced to nothing by his imposing shadow. Brand was  considered a tall man both from his fellow Chinese and visiting foreigners but  Cragg loomed half again as tall, his head and shoulders rising clear above  Brand's waves of red hair. A black cape barely spanned his massive shoulders,  hanging open and without a ripple as the material stretched over his huge frame  to halt at the folds of his leather boots. Upon the breast a Bear paced on its  four paws, depicted in glittering thread. Beneath the cloak, wooden pegs  strained to hold closed the vest of bronze silk that threatened to burst over  his barrel chest and the iron hard muscles that bulged at his abdomen.</p><p>"You're here," he said in his deep, cavernous voice,  lifting a huge hand to rub at the dark bristles on his chin.</p><p>"Full marks for observation," Willow grunted.</p><p>"We can begin," the giant rumbled. "The others are  waiting."</p><p>Cragg turned and pushed open the doors behind him,  holding them open long enough for Willow to put hand against it and take its weight,  before passing through into the next room, ducking his head so that he could  pass beneath the frame.</p><p>The hall was a vast oval, the ceiling spanned by  scarlet rafters decorated with paper charms and from which lamps hung bathing  the walls in yellow light despite the grey sky visible through the thin  windows. Pillars of marbled stone, wound with spiralling leaves of polished,  green clay stood in splendour along the hall's circumference. The pale stone of  the walls were covered with colourful paintings that reached from the cracked  tiles of the floor to the rafters. Some were faded into obscurity while others  were still beautiful in their vivid clarity. History, myth and fable depicted  in pictures. Remnants from the past rendered in colour liquids stained the  walls and thus eternity.</p><p>From the centre of the hall, was a dais, a wide  raised disc, no higher than the span of a hand. Wound around the rim like  spokes on a wheel were inscribed the eight trigrams, stark black upon the white  stone. Upon the disc's hub sat stunted round table, the black lacquer catching  the light from above on its shining surface marked with a symbol that depicted  two fish, one black and one white unified in the perfect circle of the grand  ultimate, the yin and the yang.</p><p>Four men awaited them; seated upon silk cushions  around the table they gave Brand and Cragg a cursory glance and nod of  acknowledgement before focussing their attentions on Willow approach who  scowled darkly.</p><p>"Let's get this over with," she grumbled, stepping  on to the dais and dropping her self gracelessly onto an unoccupied cushion.</p><p>Brand and Cragg joined them, the blue silk of a  cushion disappearing beneath the giants hunched form. Brand crossed his legs  and folded them beneath him rocking slightly from side to side in order to find  some semblance of comfort.</p><p>"Once again I have to ask," Blitz began toying with  the sharp bang that hung across his face, protruding from his unruly crest of  yellow hair. "What the hell are we here for?" Releasing the blade-like lock, he  added. "Some of us have more important things to attend to."</p><p>Brand seriously doubted that. <i>Unless those things  are breasts, </i>he conceded bitterly.</p><p>"Trust me, we all have places we would rather be,"  Cloud said grimly, glancing wistfully at the cushion lying vacant across from  Brand. The silk surface of his indigo tunic shimmered as he scrubbed a large  hand over his face and through his thick black hair before folding his arms.  "We are here, Blitz, because we need to clarify certain details about Willow's  fight yesterday," he said after a moment.</p><p>"What's to clarify?" Blitz said with a shrug. "She  fought and lost."</p><p>Willow glared at him but raised no protest.</p><p>"That in itself raises a few questions," Cloud  replied, arching his brow. "The biggest of them being 'Why?'" he swivelled his  head to lock gazes with the blonde girl who glowered in return.</p><p>"As a Master of Emei Baqua zhang, I have the right  to challenge whomever I choose, for my own reasons." The fire in her narrowed  eyes was a barrier to Cloud's line of inquiry, striking down any further  question to her motives.</p><p>"That is true, but has always been a rare thing for  any of our order to exercise such a right," Stone remarked. The resemblance  between him and Cloud was apparent to all who saw. The same imposingly handsome  face, with its square jaw and blue eyes that flashed beneath dark brows, that  seems furrowed in a permanent frown. However Stone's shoulders were broader,  with large slabs of muscle that contrasted against the sleeker build of his  twin brother. His clothes too bore no likeness to Clouds' finery, garbed in a  simple habit of dark grey; the sleeves torn at his shoulders, the pants tied  roughly on his calves and the sash around his waist worn and frayed. His feet  were bare and covered with dust and dirt, staining the silk cushion on which  knelt, and that he cared little for. His head and chin were clean-shaven in the  style of their Buddhist neighbours, and where his sibling glared at everything  with a scowl as dark as a storm, Stone looked on expressionless as a cliff  face.</p><p>"Rare until recently that is," he continued, his  eyes passing carefully over both Brand and Blitz.</p><p>The spiky-haired blonde smiled wryly and shrugged,  but Brand felt his jaw tighten, his eyes smouldered at Stone but he found  himself unable to hold that emotionless gaze and turned his glare to the table.</p><p>"Even more rare, is for a master of our order to  lose such a duel." Stone stated flatly, his eyes moving towards Willow.</p><p>The girl's head shot up, eyes flashing. The fury  dissolved swiftly as she watched Stone's granite-like face, her shoulders  slumped as she sagged defeated on to her forearms. Brand's teeth ground against  each other as his sister sighed, and he glared daggers at the other man, but  that flat stare never left Willow, his eyes neither disapproving nor angry;  just looking.</p><p>"Calm down,  no one is blaming you, child." Locke said, his already gnarled face was creased  further as he smiled warmly at the young woman, thin almost skeletal fingers  stroking his wiry white beard. "It is clear that the person you fought  possesses tremendous skill, and there is no shame in defeat by such a person."  He paused to pick at some miniscule speck on his voluminous silk robe, which  seemed to swallow his small and withered frame. When he looked up again it was  with a frown that furrowed his thin and very long brows, making the thin white  hairs dip to his cheeks.</p><p>"However, someone with the skills to defeat one of  us is someone who should be kept an eye on. Especially so, given the suspicious  circumstances of your loss."</p><p>"What do you mean suspicious?" Willow snapped. All  eyes were on Locke, Cloud's and Stone's gaze intense through narrowed eyes.</p><p>Locke pulled a long wooden pipe from the folds of  his robes, slowly thumbing it full of sweet herbs as he spoke. "I saw a tornado  yesterday while making some fresh tea, several of us must have."</p><p>Brand nodded  in agreement as he and Blitz has seen the cyclone as well as they ran towards  the town, he saw Cloud and Cragg make the same gesture also.</p><p>"Since the weather had been calm all day, and as  hurricanes are rare in China, it is clear that Willow used the Phoenix Wing  Gale. We all know the power of that technique, but it is she whom young Brand  found bruised and unconscious." The old man shrugged as he lit his pipe. "It  just seems a little odd."</p><p>Cloud leant forwards, propping his elbow against the  varnished table and peering across at the young girl over laced fingers. "What  happened, Willow?" he asked gruffly.</p><p>Brand could not see his sister's face, her head was  bowed and her shoulder's slumped, her bangs fell like a golden veil and  obscured her face. Her hands lay limp the well of her lap, the only sign of  life the movement of her right index fingers as it ran to and fro over the  embroidery on her right sleeve.</p><p>"She went easy on me." She said softly, a whisper  that she wanted others to hear but not herself. "The bitch was pulling her  punches," this time her voice was hard and bitter. "Hell, she didn't throw any  "punches", all were defensive strikes, to my arms or legs to parry or gain  distance. She was holding back, trying not to hurt me, and yet it was all I  could do to keep up with her."</p><p>Locke gasped around his pipe, Blitz's jaw dropped  and for a moment Brand thought he saw Stone's eyes widen, by a fraction, but  the gesture was gone in an instant. He felt himself lean forwards eyes and ears  intent upon his sister's words, butterflies flogging at his stomach. Hot  butterflies as he felt an almost burning rush in his veins. His knuckles turned  white on his fists as he fought to suppress the movement of his lips. Whether  he was battling against a growl or a smile he could not tell.</p><p>"I knew I could not match her skills in hand to hand  combat, and she had already avoided my Wind Palm technique, yet I had managed to  strike a nerve point, which tipped the balance in my favour enough to make her  frustrated. When her aura began to heat up, I walked the circle, drawing in the  winds of rage."</p><p>Willow's blue eyes fixed onto Locke's through her  blonde tresses. "She performed the final step, barely the beating of a heart  after I had struck. The wave of ice she released drew me into the vortex," she  paused, licking at her lips and swallowing, "it shot me into the air and then  it all went black."</p><p>Brand though he saw his sister's shoulders tremble,  he did not blame her. Once during training she had caught him with the Phoenix  Gale, having just learned its secrets she surprised him with it, sucking him  into the air. The summoned winds blasted his face, stinging his eyes and stealing  his breath, while furious gust battered him from all sides, hard enough to  leave bruises. Then the tornado spat him out forcefully, shooting him like a  bullet to crash through the branches and trunks of trees. It was an experience  he never wished to repeat, and he knew it must have been much harder on her, as  it was her own technique that had betrayed her.</p><p>"Willow?" Locke's ancient voice quavered slightly,  and Brand saw him share a glance with Cloud from the wrinkled corners of his  eyes. "This girl, with whom you fought. Are you sure she was Japanese?"</p><p>The girl nodded. "Yes, she wore Chinese clothes but  she was a Jap?"</p><p>Locke frowned, "Are you certain? What did she look  like?"</p><p>"Did she have a nice rack?" Blitz piped in with a  leer, earning glares from the other men gathered around the table.</p><p>Willow sighed loudly and rolled her eyes. "To answer  both of your questions, yes. She was a big-titted Japanese bitch."</p><p>" Damn it, Willow!" Cloud roared. "This is not a  joke." He leaned forwards from his cushion, supporting himself with hands flat  on the table as he peered at Willow beneath his lowered brows. "Was there  nothing unusual about this girl?"</p><p>Willow gawped at him, her eyes wide and jaw hanging  open as she shook her head.</p><p>"Think carefully," he said in frosted, soft voice.  "Anything at all? Her hair? Her height? Her eyes?"</p><p>"Red hair," she muttered. "She had red hair."</p><p>Cloud's expression became darker as he slowly  settled back onto his cushion, as if a shadow had passed across his face from  an unseen source. The blue in his eyes flashed like streaks of pale lightning.</p><p>"Nichieju," he pronounced grimly</p><p>"The Amazons?" Brand asked with a start. "What have  they got to do with this?"</p><p>"The Amazon's are fierce warriors, who train for  combat everyday of their existence. It is not unthinkable that one of their  number, could become strong enough to defeat a Baqua master." Stone mused.</p><p>"Also, they are known to have diverse hair and eye  colourings, purples, reds, blues and others," Locke added.</p><p>"You think she was an Amazon?" Willow said  incredulously. "That's absurd, she was Japanese."</p><p>"Perhaps she has Amazon blood. The Nichieju marry  any man they deem to be strong to strengthen the tribe, perhaps her father was  deemed as such." Locke rubbed at his beard and frowned. "She has definitely  received Amazon training, it is the only way for her to know the secret of the  Phoenix Wing Gale. The technique was one of The Gifts."</p><p>Silence fell over the seven like a tense, clinging  shroud as each processed this new information. Willow glared at the tabletop  her gaze burning a hole on the polished black surface. Blitz's gazed at the  ceiling, his fingers toying and spinning the end of the blade-like bang hanging  over his brow. Cragg was motionless, towering above the others with his arms folded  across his huge chest, seemingly oblivious to everything. Stone passed his cold  gaze over all of them as he sat there, hands resting in his palm and his face  bleak and emotionless like a marble statue. Locke peered at the other with a  raised brow, glancing at each of them with squinted eyes as he puffed at his  pipe. Brand felt himself seething, a starved flame ready to burst but kept  small boiling his blood, his hands worked at each other in a frenzy  systematically cracking every knuckle in his hand, each sinuous pop a melody to  his internal fire.</p><p>"You see our problem," Cloud muttered, his eyes like  blue ice. "The laws of our Order have been violated."</p><p>Locke sighed and shook his head, smoke billowing in  a fine stream as he exhaled, swirling around him in sweet scented haze. "The  Accords were written over three thousand years ago, it is possible the Amazon's  have forgotten the terms of the agreement."</p><p>"Ignorance is no excuse," Stone stated plainly.</p><p>"Then they must be punished," Brand cried, slamming  his fist on the table. "I will do it personally." He felt a grin grow on his  face that he could not hide, nor tried to.</p><p>"This is not a time to satiate your pride, Brand."  Willow griped.</p><p>Blitz nodded and added his own opinion. "Besides,  this should be left to someone who knows how to treat a lady," a smirk crawled  across his lips.</p><p>"We want her getting rid off, not knocked up." Brand  shot back, <i>her and the bastard who tried to seduce my sister, </i>he  silently swore.</p><p>"It's best we don't rush into things," Locke chided  chewing upon the end of his pipe.</p><p>"You have a better suggestion, Old man?" Brand asked  dryly.</p><p>Locke's frowned with thought, the wrinkles of his  face making his feature's seems to screw and shrivel like dried fruit. His mouth  emitted a stream of wet, percussive sound as his lips puffed and smacked around  his pipe stem, small bursts of smoke wafting from the pommel.</p><p>"Elder Locke?" Stone said. The old man snatched his  pipe from his mouth and turned to face the bald figure, a small pout on his  lips at the interruption. Stone met his eyes without expression, his face and  voice hard.</p><p>"Is not one of your students Japanese?"</p><p>Locke nodded, "Yes, a splendid young fellow. Very  bright and inquisitive." He added another sharp nod.</p><p>"His personality is irrelevant," Stone grunted, "but  perhaps he could speak with this girl. To determine whether she is Japanese as  Willow claims, and if so from where and how has she received Amazonian  training."</p><p>"Most importantly," Cloud interjected harshly. "Who  taught her, we must know who has broken the Accord, and if there are others."</p><p>Locke smiled, "That is an excellent suggestion." He  waved the stem of his pipe at Stone who merely arched an eyebrow. "My student  came to use for help with a certain ailment, however his condition also makes  it extremely hard for him to be away from his homeland. It may do him some good  to speak with a countryman."</p><p>Brand snorted, "Who cares, this isn't a comfort  visit. I still say that I should deal with them."</p><p>He was ignored by Cloud who kept his dark gaze upon  the aged scholar. "Are you sure he can be trusted?" He asked in tones of ice.  "If he sides with or help his countrymen he will share their punishment. Which  will be <i>severe.</i>"</p><p>"And if they have broken the laws?" Brand asked his  voice dripping with acid. "Do we invite them for tea? Ask them to leave  quietly?"</p><p>The temperature of the room seemed to drop and the  lights dimmed as if a black haze had passed across the sun. "Then you may have  your chance at them, dear Brother." Cloud pledged, a thunderstorm blazing in  his eyes.</p><p><b>To be continued…</b></p><p><b>AN- </b>5 months! It's  been 5 months since the last chapter. I am so very sorry. I've had so many  problems, including a computer bugger up that forced me to re-write this  chapter from scratch. That combined with many other issues personal and  professional and the writer's block from hell put of the writing of this fic.  I'm also sorry that it's not up to the standard I would like, but I really feel  that if I don't get it out now, I never will. I'll try not to let it happen  again but I can't read the future so make no promises. Once again sorry!</p><p>Thanks to Rob for  proof-reading, Larry for hosting on the Lost Library, and to Aondehafka whose  frank and helpful review woke me from my slumber and helped me fight through my  writer's block. I would advise anyone to get reading his fics White Rose and  Nocturne. And of course thanks to you for reading and you're continued  patience.</p><p><b>Glossary:</b></p><p><b>Kai Muay: </b>A training  camp for professional Muay Thai fighters.</p><p><b>Bakumatsu: </b>The  revolution that brought an end to the Tokugawa Shogunate (like any RK fan  doesn't know that)</p><p><b>Mokujin: </b>Wooden man  (known as a Mook Yan Jong in Chinese), a martial arts training tool consisting  of a dummy in a crude man shape that is struck and blocked.

Part of many Okinawan karate styles  though believed to have originated in China. <i>Note: the opinions and analysis  of this kata given by Genma is based on my own personal practise of the kata  and research and how I was taught. It is not a certainity but rather a personal  expression.</i></p><p><b>Maihanchi: </b>Dancing on  uneven ground, a variant of the Naihanchi kata created by Ranma Saotome to suit  a softer and more mobile fighter with more avoidance skills and body movements in  the application of techniques.</p><p><b>Gojushiho: </b>Fifty four  steps (also called Useishi), a kata found in many karate styles.
