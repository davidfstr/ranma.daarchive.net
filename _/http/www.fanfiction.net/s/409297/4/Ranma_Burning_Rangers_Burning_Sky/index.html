</div>"So, when are they supposed to arrive?" Inquired Nabiki as she finished getting dressed, and chuckled from her husband's lack of response. She'd figured she 'punished' him enough, and he had already seemed that he had a long day. With the Amazons arriving at any time, she expected it to be much longer.<p>Ranma managed to groan a response, then suddenly shot to alertness, "hon, you mind staying upstairs for a bit?"<p>Nabiki's response was cut off by Ranma's shushing, as she went to the closet and pulled out a spare Amazon outfit. Nabiki sighed and mouthed to her spouse, "Try to keep it out of the house, please?" Ranma shrugged and opened the door, starting downstairs.<p>_<p>Ranma quietly crept through the house, praying to herself that they at least would have the common decency to stay away from anything fragile. Ranma stretched out her senses, "they're good," she mused to herself, "they're hiding themselves well." Ranma stayed tense and alert, every nerve of her martial honed body reaching out for any potential threat, inhumanly toned muscles loose but ready to become tense as steel cables, balance consistently centered as if ready to move in every direction. Ranma was rather disappointed when she made it to the porch in the back hard, and relaxed, "Hmm, I know they're here, I wonder what they're up to."<p>"AIYAA"<p>Ranma swerved to the sound, ready to guard against an attack, and nearly tripped at the sight. Nabiki held back the chuckle of watching her female husband fall for her lousy imitation.<p>"Hello dear, took you long enough to stalk down here..."<p>"Na... Nabiki? How did you get down here?"<p>Her wife just seemed to look through her, "Hey helped me"<p>Ranma ducked a sword swing, and retaliated with a back kick, which was avoided. Before she could lower her leg, she was forced to twist out of the way of an ax kick, then back flip from a sweep from the same attacking limb.<p>As soon as Ranma landed, she blocked a whipping cane swing with her leather bracer on her right hand, then pushed the weapon aside and stepped into the guard of the Amazon. A double palm strike sent the warrior fifteen feet away, wind knocked out of her.<p>Ranma pulled to her left as a vertical swipe just barely missed her right shoulder. Ranma spun on her left heel and rammed her left elbow into her assailant's sternum, then rotated her arm at the elbow and back fisted her, sending the second Amazon stumbling back. Ranma snaked her left hand out and caught the Amazon's right hand that was still holding the sword, then brought the arm up and twisted under it to parry a bonbori strike and threw a right tai kick at it's owner's ribs. Ranma continued her right leg into a knee strike; catching the sword bearer she was just previously dealing with in the chin and sending her off the porch, into a tree.<p>Ranma stomped her right leg down, using the momentum to leap tightly, and turned her body horizontally, twisting like a funnel as one Amazon's sword passed under her, while a tan fah passed over her, barely missing clipping her. Ranma landed in low, her right hand punching one of the duo in the gut, while her left leg slipped back and tripped up the second. Before the first Amazon could completely double over from the gut punch, Ranma grasped her by the top and bottom of her leather brazier, and threw her onto her grounded companion.<p>Ranma ducked under the first Amazon he dealt with and her diving double horizontal lotus sword swing, rooted herself into a horse stance, and punched upward, catching the first warrior in the gut as she did at to the previous opponent, then casually dropped her onto the ground on top of the two on the ground.<p>The Redheaded woman spun around and pulled her head back in time to miss the tip of a whipping cane connecting with her jaw. The wielder continued the horizontal swing from the left, and then brought the back over top with her right hand, which her opponent sidestepped. In a continuous motion in a classic heaven six pattern, the Amazon brought the other end back to her right, aiming to catch Ranma in the left ribs. Ranma deftly leapt over the strike, then faded to her own right from the following horizontal strike. Ranma stepped out as once again the other end of the staff was swung towards her right side, then stepped, bracing her left forearm against the other girl's left arm, behind her elbow.<p>In a fluid motion that lasted less than a second, Ranma replaced her left hand with her right behind the girl's left elbow, and brought her left hand down onto the inside of the wrist of the same arm for an arm bar. Following that, Ranma just slightly bringing her right hand off the girl's arm, and torquing down her whole body to her right, pounding on the bottom poor girl's bicep near where it met the inside of the elbow, simultaneously bringing her own right elbow horizontally into where the girl's pectoral and deltoid, while the whole motion shot the girl downwards, Ranma bringing the top of her forehead down to slam under the bottom of the girl's jaw. The red headed woman then straightened her left arm out and struck her forearm against the side of the girl's head. Ranma didn't finish there as she slipped her left hand down onto the back of the girl's neck, and attempted to jerk her down into her raised left knee. The girl stiffened and fought against being pulled down, as Ranma expected, and The matriarch in training snapped her leg up at the knee into an upwards high snap kick, sending the girl over her head and into the pile of Amazons behind her.<p>"Feh, pathetic, the five of you couldn't even take out an old hag like me," Onna-Ranma sniffed, and suddenly found she couldn't say anymore, as her face was smashed through the porch floor.<p>"Dad, you really fight like a girl!" proclaimed Ukyo as he stood on the top of his female father's head, causing Ranma to groan a bit.<p>"So, what's this all about?" questioned Emmanuel as he sat down next to Big. He had been called to his commander's office after he had finished maintenancing the Burning Ship.<p>"Yes, I'm pretty sure you've heard about the weather regulation system that was being worked on, code named Stormwatch, am I correct?"<p>"Aye, being able to control the weather worldwide, that's some heavy stuff!" replied the Hispanic. He didn't particularly care for the tampering of Mother Nature on a large scale, but if it was for the benefit of mankind...<p>"We were invited to it's unveiling. It's supposed to go operational in a week."<p>"Only a week? Didn't take them very long to complete it."<p>"You're right, that job we did yesterday at the chemical plant? I did some digging and found out the cause of the explosion. They were sabotaged"<p>"Sabotaged? That doesn't make sense."<p>"Not at first," countered Big, "that gas that kept the fire going, that was an experimental fuel for Weatherman, a competing project for Stormwatch. That was a major component for it, and when that went up in flames, so to speak, all funding and resources was put towards Stormwatch, allowing them to advance the project further."<p>"Heh, so you believe this is some sort of conspiracy?"<p>"Not that I can say, Stormwatch could fall victim to the same saboteurs. Both projects aren't very popular with all factions. My instincts tell me that something major is going to happen," Big folded his hands in front of him, placing his chin on top of them, "Project; Stormwatch may fall under the same fate."<p>"Darn it, Nabiki, that was just dirty, and you know it!" Ranma groused, now back in his male form lying on the couch with a cold compress on his forehead, the five Amazon visitors were out back still with his son sparring to pass the time while their mentor recovered herself, "you set me up!"<p>"Did I just hear Ranma Saotome, Master of Amazonian fighting arts and master of the Anything Goes School of Martial arts, complain about an unfair advantage? Oh my ears doth deceive me!"<p>"Cute, Nabs, cute, first you KNOW I had a long day, then you wear me out upstairs, THEN you sick the Amazon squad out there on me, were you really that ticked with me?" Ranma griped in reply, and decided to change the subject, "Any idea why they're here? I had to leave before Cologne told me the full story."<p>"I don't think Cologne would have told you until it was too late," Nabiki ventured, "and I thought it would be poor sportsmanship to spoil the surprise."<p>"Well? You gonna tell me or not?"<p>"Why Ranma, they're here to be trained as the next generation of Burning Rangers..."<p>"So, we're planning on attending?" Emmanuel was hoping for a negative answer, he's already behind on his UWA Mexican Wrestling videos, not to mention his cult idol El Santos vids, and he didn't care for formal events anyhow.<p>Big picked up on the unvoiced plea, "You don't HAVE to go, but you're on call at that time, so's Ranma. Courtney will be my date for the evening."<p>Emmanuel groaned at the news that he'll have to sit on wait, at least he won't have to wear a monkey suit this time around, "Aren't you being a little paranoid about this?"<p>"Maybe, but I'll sleep safer that night knowing that I was paranoid for no reason."<p>Ranma blinked a couple of times, sorting out what he was just told, "I don't get it."<p>Nabiki sighed, wasn't the blatant answer obvious enough, "Mr. Saotome, you..." she put her finger against her husband's chest, "are to train them..." she pointed outside, "in the skills needed to be a Burning Ranger, and on top of that you will sponsor their application to the Burning Rangers."<p>"I understand that Nabiki, but, why? Why would they care about the Burning Rangers? This isn't like it's an Amazon affair."<p>Nabiki's slightly annoyed look turned into a sincere smile," Sigh, Ranma, as much as an isolationalist village Neichiizu is, they're proud of what you do for the rest of the world. Many of the young girls and boys there look up to the Future Amazon matriarch.."<p>"I never said I was gonna be Matriarch"<p>"... and their premier male warrior who are renowned the world over. You and Mousse are leaders, and even the elders so set in the old ways see the benefits with another generation of warriors joining the Burning Rangers."<p>"And those benefits are?" Ranma asked skeptically.<p>"Well, the Chinese government stays off their backs, because of the popular influence you have. They no longer have to battle for survival from other outside parties, but being Burning Rangers allows their heritage for being the strongest warriors to survive, just with a different type of enemy. It gets their younger ones more experience with the outside world; the Amazon nation is joining the 21st century after all. Lastly, you'll get to spread your new martial arts firefighting techniques through out the tribe."<p>"Heh, you have this all worked out, don'tja Nabs?"<p>Nabiki threw a pillow at her husband, "You KNOW how much I hate that name, and it's obvious anyhow, at least to anyone with my intellect."<p>"Heh, of course. Well I'm going to take a bath and go take a nap, just wake me in time for dinner, and tell Ukyo to practice his katas while I'm asleep," with that, Ranma went upstairs to get a change of clothes then to the furo.<p>Nabiki walked into the back yard as he caught one of the Amazons, Teepee She thought her name was, sparring with her son.<p>"Aiyah, Ukyo good fighter, if he defeat T'chi Pei, he may have to get Kiss of Marriage," spoke the Amazon in a pidgin accent that reminded Nabiki of an acquaintance years past.<p>"You get that kiss, I'm paying you to elope, quipped Nabiki, earning a 'icky' face from her son at the prospect of kissing. "Already a lady-killer like your father, I think no less than four fiancées will do for my young man."<p>Ukyo paused at his mom's comment to ask what she meant, and caught a thrust kick to his side for his lack of attention. The young boy glared at the innocent acting Amazon for a few seconds for the cheap shot.<p>"T'chi Pei no want get married so soon," stated the Amazon girl innocently.<p>"Well, your father says for you to work on your Katas, he's too tired to train you today."<p>"Huh? Why's pop to tired?"<p>Nabiki had the good graces to blush while the five visitors giggled. "Ahem, anyhow, you need to practice, any of you mind helping me out in the kitchen with dinner?"<p>"So you'll be attending? Splendid! How many of the esteemed Burning Rangers will be attending? I understand, duty comes first after all, but I wanted to meet the famous Ranma Saotome whose daring exploits have made your division so famous. You'll ask him? That's gracious of you; let him know that I would be highly honored with his presence. Thank you, I must get back to work if I am to make this deadline, Stormwatch won't build itself after all, you're kind to afford me some of your humor, good evening Mr. Landman."<p>Dr. Kimson disconnected the video line and turned back to his terminal. He had a lot to work on in order for Stormwatch to be complete on time. The virtual interface would allow a comfortable virtual reality interaction with the controls of the environmental control system. He pressed his glasses further up his slightly elongated nose, yes, it all had to be perfect by the time of unveiling. Fully aware of the problems of another similar project, Kimson endeavored to make everything failsafe...<p>Failsafe, indeed.<p>_<p>"Hmm? I dunno, Ranma avoids shindigs like that. Oh? It's an order now? I don't think he'll very cooperative... of course I would love to go, mhmm, I guess I can be very convincing at times. That shouldn't be a problem, I have five babysitters on hand right now, in fact, Teepee's here, would you like to speak to her?"<p>Nabiki blinked as the line clicked and went dead, then chuckled to herself as she hung up the phone, "Hey, Teepee, Big says 'hello'."<p>"For last time," cried a voice from the living room, "Teepee name, er, T'chi Pei name is T'CHI PEI! NO 'TEEPEE'... Airen call to speak to T'chi Pei?"<p>"Sorry dear, official business of the Burning Rangers, but he gives his love."<p>Ranma walked into the hall after glancing at the love struck look across the young Amazon's face, "That wasn't very nice, you know?"<p>"Comon, Ranma, a girl's gotta have her adolescent fantasies every now and then."<p>"No, I mean now I'm gonna have to take her to meet him so she won't go on a rampage again, Big'll get upset with me, and I'll end up doing a week of paperwork and polishing boost packs again, thanks a lot... Nabs." Ranma chuckled as he pulled just out of reach of his wife's attack.<p>"What have I told you about calling me 'Nabs', dear? Do you LIKE sleeping in the Dojo while the heater's still not fixed? Anyhow, consider it fair since he's making attend the Stormwatch activation ceremony and you'll be complaining to him about it for weeks."<p>"Oh, no, I'm not going! Remember the last big party thingy? Nothin' doin'!" Protested the pigtailed man, waking warding signs with his hands.<p>"Oh yes, I recall that, I guess you'll just have to go as a woman then. That way you're not recognized and remembered by certain... parties, and you're staying away from any peculiar tasting punch' too. Though I must say, you had a pretty solid booking for that month."<p>Nabiki chuckled as her husband marched off mumbling curses to himself about mastering drunken 'strip'fu'.
