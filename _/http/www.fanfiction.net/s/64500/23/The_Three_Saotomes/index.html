</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 23<p>The Tournament: Round 2<p>+++++++++++<p>"Hey, I know that girl," said Nabiki as she raised her camcorder<br/>and smiled for a moment.<p>"Pardon?" said Nodoka as she looked down for a moment towards the<br/>girl.<p>"She beat Akane in a tournament a while back. It was just before<br/>your family showed up, Rhythmic Gymnastics Martial Arts, or something<br/>like that," said Nabiki with a slight chuckle.<p>"I see...this is a sport?" Nodoka looked somewhat skeptical.<p>"Yup, there's talk of having it in the Olympics next year,"<br/>replied Nabiki with a small shrug as she continued to film. "Akane's<br/>gonna cream her though. Especially since Ranma's been helping her."<p>"Did she not lose before?" commented Nodoka.<p>"Well, yeah. There are lots of weird rules in Rhythmic Gymnastics<br/>Martial Arts though, Akane's not real good at stuff like that anyway,<br/>so she had a big handicap." Nodoka's eyebrow arched as the girl's grin<br/>widened suddenly. "This time, it's Kodachi with the handicap."<p>Nearby, a small group of girls began to cheer for Akane, most of<br/>them in bandages of some kind.<p>Nodoka paused and looked over to them for a moment. "So, Akane and<br/>my son get along well?"<p>"Ha! She's the only one in the house, who hates him more than I<br/>do," replied Nabiki without taking her camcorder away from the battle.<p>"But he is training her, is he not?"<p>"Yup, and she doesn't want anything to do with it. Dad asked Ranma<br/>to do it, so he's going to, whether she wants him too or not," said<br/>Nabiki coolly. "He seems to enjoy it though."<p>Nodoka narrowed her eyes slightly and frowned. "I see."<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Kodachi jumped back as the round began and twirled her ribbon in<br/>front of her with an evil looking smirk. "I demand that you face me<br/>fairly, using the rules of Rhythmic Gymnastics Martial Arts."<p>Akane snarled in reply. "Sorry, no thanks." She slowly began to<br/>stalk forward cracking her knuckles.<p>"Oh? Are you a coward then?" said Kodachi with a girlish chuckle.<p>"Naw, I just don't like you. This is my house bitch, and I'm not<br/>changing the rules just cause you decided to come over and play!"<br/>snapped Akane as she rushed forward and put her hand through an<br/>opening in the ribbon, catching Kodachi dead in the face.<p>The girl was sent flying, and landed on the edge of the ring. She<br/>wiped the side of her face in shock as she looked at the ground for a<br/>moment. A small spot of blood appeared there, followed by another as<br/>it trickled from between her lips. Kodachi turned her gaze towards<br/>Akane, who was standing calmly in the center of the ring with her arms<br/>crossed. Kodachi narrowed her eyes down to mere slits and scowled.<br/>"This is a battle of honor, I demand that you conform to my..."<p>"You don't have the right to make demands like that," replied<br/>Akane as she got into a ready position again, the cold smile still on<br/>her lips. "Besides, I'm not stupid enough to give up my advantage just<br/>because you're a blowhard."<p>Kodachi was almost shaking with rage. "You should learn to listen<br/>to your betters foul girl."<p>Akane smirked again, "That's just it, ya see, you ain't better<br/>than me."<p>"You dare!" screamed Kodachi as she jumped forward, slashing the<br/>ribbon out like a whip.<p>Akane's arm moved with incredible speed, within a half second she<br/>had the front portion of the weapon wrapped around her forearm. She<br/>gave a hard tug and Kodachi jerked forward in mid air. The gymnast's<br/>eyes went wide as she saw Akane put up her elbow. She slammed into it<br/>gut first and let out all the air in her lungs in a single breath, she<br/>coughed and slumped over onto Akane, coughing gently as she attempted<br/>to regain her breath.<p>"You humiliated me, and hundreds of other girls, you cheating<br/>bitch. Now I'm going to show you what pain and humiliation really feel<br/>like," whispered Akane as the girl hung over her shoulder. Kodachi<br/>made a groaning sound, as she seemed to understand, but was unable to<br/>speak. Akane put her on her feet and smiled as she kissed the girl on<br/>her cheek gently. "Don't go to sleep yet, the fun is just starting."<p>A small cry of, "Ayah! No fair!" could be heard from an unknown<br/>spectator.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Ranma was sitting on the sidelines, simply staring at the scene in<br/>shock. "I think she's overdoing it a bit..."<p>Kuno was halfway to his feet with a similar expression on his<br/>face. "S-sister!"<p>"Well, what the hell did you expect? She hasn't had a real fight<br/>since you started training her. This is her first chance to blow off<br/>all that steam. You've been pissing her off daily for months," said<br/>Genryu calmly.<p>Ranma blinked and looked at him for a moment. "Oh."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Akane pounded Kodachi relentlessly; the Kuno girl tried<br/>desperately to counter with everything she had. She jumped back away<br/>from the enraged martial artist and gasped for breath, the look of<br/>shock still on her face despite the bruises. Her hair was wild, long<br/>since fallen out of her ponytail; it hung around her face drenched in<br/>sweat. She could see a blur out of one of her eyes, but the other was<br/>still clear. Akane was simply standing, and smiling at her, covered<br/>only in a light sweat from her effort. Even her hair was still intact.<p>"This cannot be!" screamed Kodachi angrily. She jumped up and<br/>pulled a ball from seemingly nowhere. "Die!"<p>The sphere slammed into the ground as Kodachi spiked it exploding<br/>on impact just in front of Akane. The Tendo girl was thrown back and<br/>landed on the ground smoothly, rolling back onto her feet. "You'll pay<br/>for that."<p>"Die! Just die!" screamed Kodachi with a madness in her eyes as<br/>she spun her hoop around on her wrist and flung it forward.<p>Akane reached up and caught it, stopping it cold. A small trickle<br/>of blood ran down the length of her forearm where she had been cut on<br/>her hand from the hidden razor blades. She smiled for a moment. Idly,<br/>she lowered the hoop and removed the ribbon from the base of her hair.<br/>With a vicious snarl, she glared at Kodachi as she pulled her long<br/>dark hair up behind her head for a moment, and then cut it off,<br/>leaving a much shorter cut that hung just above her neck. She tossed<br/>the hoop aside and looked over at Tofu for a moment, watching him she<br/>took ribbon that had once tied her hair, and wrapped it around her<br/>injured hand. Her face became a smirk once again as she turned back<br/>towards Kodachi. "Come on then, you aren't finished yet are you?"<p>+++++++++++<p>Tofu simply stared in shock as the girl cut off her hair, she<br/>seemed to be looking directly at him, with something in her eyes that<br/>he couldn't quite make out. "What is she doing?" he muttered to<br/>himself.<p>"Saying goodbye," replied Xianghua coolly as she watched the scene<br/>from behind him.<p>Tofu turned back and looked at her in confusion. "Huh?"<p>"It's something only a woman would understand, just forget about<br/>it," said the Chinese woman as she nodded her head back towards the<br/>fight. "You're missing it."<p>Tofu frowned, and turned back towards the battle again.<p>+++++++++++<p>Akane smirked viciously as she watched Kodachi pull the clubs from<br/>behind her back. "I shall destroy you with my final attack!" cried the<br/>gymnast with a vicious snarl. She flicked the switches on the sides of<br/>the club, revealing rows of spikes, this time she didn't even bother<br/>to hide them.<p>Akane snarled at this, and absently fingered a scar, hidden just<br/>behind her hair, on the right side of her head. "Oh yeah, I owe you<br/>for that too." She rushed forward, towards her opponent.<p>"The blow of a thousand clubs!" screamed Kodachi as she met the<br/>charge. There seemed to be hundreds of clubs in her hands.<p>"Kiyahhhhh!" screamed Akane as she stopped just in front of the<br/>blur and performed a spinning crescent kick. The kick went around the<br/>blur of motion and caught Kodachi's chin. Instead of throwing the girl<br/>aside, Akane grabbed the soft flesh with her foot, and lifted the girl<br/>over her head with her leg, throwing her over and then down across the<br/>ground flat on her back. With a satisfied smile she pulled her leg<br/>down and stood calmly watching Kodachi lay there.<p>The unfortunate Kuno simply stared up at the sky blankly, working<br/>her mouth open and closed as she found it nearly impossible to<br/>breathe. Her body was completely pale and she twitched every so often.<br/>Finally, she sat upright and gasped, taking in a deep breath. With<br/>that done, she fell on her back again, unconscious.<p>Akane merely walked away from the scene with a hard frown. She<br/>moved over beside Ranma and sat down calmly.<p>"You over did it a bit," commented Ranma. "She almost died."<p>"She didn't did she?" replied the girl coldly.<p>"You're not in complete control Akane," replied Ranma with a<br/>frown.<p>"I've got enough," she said with a small glare at him.<p>"Don't bite off more than you can chew," replied Ranma calmly.<p>"I've wanted to do that to her for a long time. I knew exactly<br/>what I was doing," snapped Akane as she turned away from him.<p>"If you had lost complete control of that kick for even a moment,<br/>she could have died," said Ranma firmly.<p>"I didn't," replied Akane.<p>"But you could have. There was any number of less dangerous ways<br/>you could have gotten the same result. It was foolish Akane," insisted<br/>Ranma.<p>Akane opened her mouth to reply and simply worked it open and<br/>closed for a moment. Finally, she turned away from him and snorted.<br/>"Fine...you're right," she muttered quietly.<p>A new figure stood beside them suddenly, he had his hands hidden<br/>away in his long robes and smiled at them for a moment. "That was a<br/>good fight, I'm definitely impressed." The boy handed Akane a small<br/>pair of scissors and a hand mirror from the folds of his robe.<p>"Is most impressive," agreed Shampoo from beside him. "Great<br/>Grandmother say she make good Amazon."<p>""Hello," said Ranma with a small nod as he looked over at them.<br/>The both had recovered from their own battles, and had chosen to stay<br/>and watch the fights.<p>"Nihao, we decide to come sit here, if is all right," said the<br/>girl with a small bow.<p>"Fine by me," said Ranma with a shrug. "Just pick a spot."<p>"What about that old woman?" said Taro calmly as he looked over at<br/>Cologne, who had not moved yet.<p>"She say she rather sit by self," replied Shampoo with a small<br/>shrug.<p>Taro frowned at them for a moment, but said nothing else. Ryoga<br/>looked rather indifferent at the whole scene, not really caring.<br/>Genryu's attitude was much the same. Ukyo seemed to cling a bit<br/>tighter to her husband at the sight of the Amazon though.<p>+++++++++<p>The crowd had quieted slightly after the last battle, Hakama stood<br/>up and smiled at them, spreading his arms wide as he did so, causing<br/>another cheer to rise from it.<p>"And so the dramatic battle continues! Next up, Genryu Saotome,<br/>and newcomer Ryu Kumon!"<p>Genryu frowned as he stood up and walked towards the ring. Ranma<br/>grabbed his arm and turned him towards him. "Try not to tear up the<br/>ring too badly, all right?"<p>Ukyo looked at the boy for a moment. "What did you mean by that?"<p>"Yes, pigtailed boy know Bakusai Tenketsu or something?" agreed<br/>Shampoo.<p>"Naw, just watch and you'll catch on. This isn't the first fight<br/>between these two idiots," said Ranma as he watched Kumon slowly<br/>swagger his way from his own spot opposite them.<p>"Is old enemies?" said Shampoo, as she seemed to understand.<p>"Sort of, kinda rivals more than anything else, he'll tell ya if<br/>you ask him later," replied Ranma with a shrug.<p>++++++++++++++<p>In the center of the ring, the two fighters squared off.<p>"I'm surprised you didn't call yourself Genryu Saotome."<p>"I don't need to. I'll beat the secret of Umisenken from you this<br/>time," replied Ryu. "The name means nothing, now that I know what<br/>these arts are truly for."<p>"Well, that ain't my fault," said Genryu with a shrug. "You've<br/>seen it enough times, I figured you'd have gotten it by now."<p>"You think that's enough?" snapped Ryu coldly.<p>"I learned it after seeing it only once, come on now. You're just<br/>lucky Ranma didn't let me make you seal that style away," said Genryu<br/>as he cracked his knuckles absently.<p>"It was given to my family. As he says, neither of you has the<br/>right to seal it away from me," said Ryu coldly.<p>"Whatever, let's just get started. That Hakama guy is takin too<br/>long," snorted Genryu as he moved into an offensive stance.<p>"Fine by me!" replied Ryu as he rushed towards the boy. "Don't<br/>move!"<p>"Heh," said Genryu as he started to fade away as he took up an<br/>unusual closed stance. "I'm not dumb enough to fall for that way." By<br/>the time his words were finished, Genryu was gone.<p>"Damn!" snapped Ryu angrily.<p>+++++++++++<p>Hakama was still working the crowd as the battle began. He put his<br/>arms down to his sides and glared at the battling pair for a moment in<br/>frustration. "Not yet you idiots! This is a tournament, not a bar<br/>fight!" Finally, he flung his hands into the air and gave up. He<br/>slumped down in his chair and growled for a moment before settling in<br/>to watch the fight.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Demon God Assault Bomb!" screamed Ryu as he threw three blades of<br/>air into a spot where he had seen a hint of movement. It exploded in a<br/>shower of concrete and dust, leaving a three-foot crater behind.<p>Genryu appeared behind the boy and frowned. "Calm down Kumon, we<br/>aren't the only ones who have to use this ring. Besides, there's a lot<br/>of people around."<p>Ryu smiled and spun on his feet charging Genryu before the boy<br/>could react. "Poison snake deep hole blow!"<p>Genryu replied by pushing himself off the boy's arm and over his<br/>head, he seemed to vanish out of thin air a moment later. His landing<br/>didn't even disturb the dust on the ground. Ryu simply slumped<br/>forward, clutching at his back as two long tears appeared down his<br/>back<p>Ryu turned his head angrily, but only saw a fist slam into his<br/>face. He staggered back, disoriented even more than before by the<br/>blow. He seemed to stop staggering suddenly, standing upright with an<br/>odd look on his face. He slowly turned and looked at Genryu, who<br/>appeared to have been standing with his foot in the kick at the base<br/>of the back of the boy's neck, waiting for him to get to it. Then, Ryu<br/>slumped forward and landed face first on the ground.<p>"That was surprisingly short," commented Akane as Ukyo finished<br/>evening out her hair for her. It was very short, and almost a bowl cut<br/>now.<p>"Hey, that's a good look for you," commented Ranma as he looked<br/>back at her.<p>Akane looked at him in shock for a moment. "What?"<p>"They were holding back. Genryu and Ryu both, there's too many<br/>people around for those two morons to go all out. I'm sure Kumon will<br/>show up later for a real match with my little brother." He looked up<br/>as Genryu approached them lazily. "I'm just glad this fool decided not<br/>to show off like last time."<p>Akane looked annoyed for a moment at his dodging of her question,<br/>but just nodded anyway and let it slide.<p>"Hey! Hit hard and fast remember?" snorted Genryu lazily.<br/>"Besides, I almost lost because of that."<p>"I know, that's what I was afraid of. Jeez, you'd think you were<br/>trying to teach him how to do that stuff, the way you acted last<br/>time," snorted Ranma lazily.<p>"Why would I do that?" said Genryu with a slight blush on his<br/>face.<p>"I dunno, so he'd make a better opponent maybe?" surmised Ranma<br/>without looking as his brother sat down next to his wife.<p>Ukyo looked at her husband's face for a moment and frowned at him.<br/>"Oh, you have got to be kidding." Genryu just slumped down a bit more,<br/>looking pretty uncomfortable. "Oh my god! He's right! You really are<br/>an idiot!" cried Ukyo.<p>Taro chuckled to himself and looked up at Hakama. "Well, me, the<br/>kid with the bokuten, Ranma's wife, and the cross dresser's wife are<br/>all who haven't gone yet. I wonder who's next?"<p>Hakama stood as if in answer to the question as the crowd went<br/>silent again. He had a stack of index cards in his hands with the<br/>names of the contestants written on them.<p>"Next up in our exciting battle! Pantsuto Taro and Ukyo Saotome!"<p>Pantsuto went completely white, he slowly turned to stare at<br/>Hakama for a moment as the boy looked down at the card in his hand in<br/>confusion. Apparently unaware of why the crowd was laughing again.<br/>"Damn it! Who keeps giving me these stupid joke cards?"<p>Taro was shaking in anger, flashes of red filled his eyes. "How<br/>dare he! I'll kill him!"<p>"Not until I get my turn Taro," replied Ranma calmly as he turned<br/>to level a glare his friend for a moment. "Behave yourself for now,<br/>and I'll leave you some when I'm done with him."<p>"Don't bother, scum like that isn't worth my time," replied Taro<br/>viciously. "Come on girly, let's get this over with."<p>"Taro," growled Genryu in a warning tone.<p>"Don't worry, I'll take it easy on her," commented the boy as he<br/>waved his hand back at him without bothering to look.<p>"What a jerk!" fumed Ukyo, "Take it easy on me? Who does he think<br/>he is?" snapped the girl as she pulled the huge spatula from her back<br/>and followed him into the ring.<p>++++++++++++<p>After a moment, the pair was standing in the center of the ring.<br/>Hakama merely raised his arm and thrust it down, signaling the start<br/>of the battle. Ukyo took a few swings at him with the oversized<br/>baker's peel, and Taro merely backed away before pouring a flask of<br/>water over his head. Ukyo jumped back in shock, and Taro promptly<br/>bopped her over the top of her head, sending her to the ground in a<br/>pile. The minotaur calmly lifted her over its shoulder and walked back<br/>to its place, setting her down beside her husband calmly.<p>+++++++++++<p>The crowd had not made a sound for some time yet. Most of them<br/>simply stared at the scene in silent shock, along with Hakama.<p>"What was?" stammered Nodoka dumbly.<p>"My guess is that was Ranma's friend, Pantsuto Taro. He told us<br/>about him a while back," replied Nabiki casually as she continued to<br/>roll. The look on Hakama's face was especially rewarding.<p>Said man was simply looking at the beast as it boiled water in a<br/>small fire it had made just outside the ring. "I...I've found it," he<br/>stammered in shock. "After all that time hunting across China! I've<br/>found it..." His face slowly changed into a dark smile. "Well Mr.<br/>Pantsuto, it seems I'll have to remember you. We'll meet again, heh."<p>He then stood up again, to announce the next fight.<p>"Quite a show, isn't it folks?" The stunned silence started to<br/>break, a weak cheer rose from the crowd, as they were still uncertain<br/>about what had just happened. Most of the Nerimites were relatively<br/>back to normal though, weird things tended to happen there, but this<br/>had to be one of the top ten. "Our next battle is a true test of<br/>strength indeed! The regional high school kendo champion, Tatewaki<br/>Kuno, versus, the beautiful and deadly Chinese Kung Fu master,<br/>Xianghua!"<p>+++++++++<p>Tatewaki Kuno stood opposite Xianghua with a frown on his face as<br/>he glared at her. "I do not wish to harm you woman, leave now and I<br/>shall stay my wrath."<p>"Don't do me any favors," replied the woman as she spread her arms<br/>and moved into a Kung fu starting stance.<p>"Very well, I shall do my best not to smite you too harshly. Honor<br/>must carry me through this battle," said the boy as he moved into a<br/>closed stance with his hand resting on the hilt of his bokuten.<p>"Fight!" cried Hakama as he signaled the start.<p>Kuno rushed forward, pulling out the wooden blade as he charged<br/>her.<p>Xianghua performed the splits, and slammed her fist into his<br/>crotch.<p>Kuno's eyes went wide, but he remained standing, much to his<br/>credit.<p>"Don't think I'm weak just because I'm a woman," said Xianghua as<br/>she stood up and smiled at him. He simply stood there, with the same<br/>shocked and painful expression on his face. "You were an ally once, so<br/>I guess I can't hurt you too badly," she commented as she chopped him<br/>on the neck, sending him to the ground. She smiled and started to walk<br/>away.<p>Kuno coughed and slowly stood up again. "Hold woman! The mighty<br/>Blue Thunder cannot be defeated so easily."<p>Xianghua frowned as she turned to face him again. "Get back on the<br/>ground, you're in no condition to fight me."<p>"Heh, such a cowardly attack. You are not as honorable as you once<br/>seemed," replied Kuno with a small chuckle.<p>"And Ranma is?" said the woman with her frown deepening slightly.<p>"I shall deal with him soon enough," replied Kuno as he finally<br/>shook of her first attack.<p>"Come on then, show me if you're really good enough," said<br/>Xianghua as she charged forward again.<p>Kuno slashed at her with his bokuten, missing narrowly as she<br/>jumped back slightly and then kicked him in the jaw, sending him<br/>flying back on his rear.<p>The boy stood up again and charged forward, this time with a<br/>downward slash, followed by a quick strike with his wooden batto.<p>Xianghua dodged both strikes by a hair's length and swept his feet<br/>out from under him with her legs. She let out a small growl in the<br/>back of her throat as he rose to his feet once again.<p>"Such weak attacks can never defeat Tatewaki Kuno, the Blue<br/>Thunder of Furinkan High!"<p>"I guess I'll just have to hit you harder then!" she cried in<br/>frustration as she punched him in the solar plexus and then uppercut<br/>him in the jaw.<p>She stood calmly with her back turned on him and let out a sigh as<br/>he remained down. "Finally."<p>"I am not defeated!" cried Kuno as he sat up slowly.<p>Xianghua narrowed her eyes and frowned again, sending her foot<br/>back into his face without even bothering to look.<p>Kuno was sprawled out on his back, he looked up at the sky and<br/>frowned. "I feel nothing, I am not yet beaten."<p>Xianghua made a fist and growled as she slammed her foot down into<br/>his prone form without looking at him again. This time it hit his<br/>stomach and he jerked for a moment.<p>"A mere tap," coughed Kuno, "No mere woman could defeat the might<br/>of..."<p>This time Xianghua whirled around to face him, gritting her teeth<br/>in anger. She stomped him repeatedly in his crotch. "Stupid pig! Just<br/>die!" she screamed angrily.<p>Finally, Kuno crossed his eyes, and passed out.<p>"Honestly" screamed the woman as she stalked out of the ring and<br/>sat down next to Tofu again.<p>Fortunately, she never noticed all the men around her slowly move<br/>away uncomfortably.<p>Hakama stood with a smile on his face and watched several men<br/>carry the prone form of Kuno to the sidelines. Ranma, Genryu, Mousse,<br/>and Taro simply looked at him, and then back to Xianghua. They were<br/>all pale.<p>"Are you sure she just wants to kill you?" said Akane as she<br/>looked at Ranma with a smirk on her face.<p>"I sure hope so," commented Genryu.<p>++++++++<p>Hakama spread his arms again and smiled at the crowd. "Well,<br/>certainly an exciting beginning! Now it's time for the real fights to<br/>begin! Next up, Ranma versus Asswipe the Mighty!"<p>"Hey!" cried Matin as he jumped up. "I thought I told you to<br/>change that!"<p>"To what?" said Hakama with a shrug.<p>Matin looked at him blankly and worked his jaw for a moment. "I<br/>uhhh... DAMN YOU!"<p>Ranma smiled and walked up to meet the boy in the center of the<br/>ring. "So, have you learned anything new?"<p>Matin approached and balled up his fists in anger. "You'll find<br/>out soon enough!"<p>"Well, shall we get started then?" said Ranma with his maddening<br/>smile still present.<p>+++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>
