</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 25<p>The final lesson.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Genryu stood across from Taro with a grin on his face, eyeing the<br/>boy carefully.<p>"You ready Fem-boy?" said Taro indignantly.<p>"Any time Pantyhose," replied Genryu confidently.<p>"Shall we get started then?"<p>Hakama was sitting lazily in his chair still, not even bothering<br/>to get up for this fight. He knew they'd start when they felt like it,<br/>whether he signaled for it to begin or not.<p>"Come on!" snapped Genryu as he rushed forward with a snap kick<br/>that was easily swatted aside by the older boy.<p>"You'll have to do better than that," said Taro with a chuckle as<br/>he forced the boy on the defensive with a few lightning fast punches.<p>"Damn," muttered Genryu with a frown.<p>"Let's see how long you last now," said Taro as he jumped back and<br/>pulled the flask from his belt.<p>"Ha!" said Genryu as he moved into a lower stance. Taro was<br/>looking at him with shock on his face as he grasped at his side. The<br/>flask was gone. "Looking for this?" said Genryu as he threw the flask<br/>on the ground, shattering it.<p>"You little..." grumbled Taro angrily as he moved into a combat<br/>stance again.<p>"Do you really think I'll let you change? Come on, I'm not that<br/>stupid," said Genryu as he cracked his knuckles and charged forward<br/>again.<p>Taro was on the defensive again, staggering back under the<br/>assault. He jumped back and spun around in a kick that missed Genryu<br/>by ten feet.<p>"What the heck?" muttered the younger boy as he rubbed at his<br/>forehead in irritation. Another blow struck his chest, and then<br/>another on his leg. Taro was too far away to be hitting him.<p>Taro paused and chuckled, stepping back to prepare for another<br/>kick. "What's the matter? Does that hurt?"<p>Genryu frowned and looked on the ground for a split second, only<br/>to be struck again. This time he caught a sound that he'd missed<br/>before. It was a small clattering on the ground in front of him.<br/>"That's it!" he thought.<p>"Come on Fem-boy! We don't have all day!" snapped Taro angrily as<br/>he launched another kick. This time he lurched forward with a<br/>surprised frown.<p>Genryu had punched just after his kick was completed. "Keep it up,<br/>and you'll run out of rocks to throw at me, Pantyhose."<p>Taro growled, he was standing in the destroyed section of the ring<br/>from Genryu and Ryu's earlier battle. "Oh yeah? Let's see you catch<br/>this one!" snapped Taro as he kicked a huge section of the destroyed<br/>rink into the air and launched it at Genryu.<p>The Saotome boy punched it out of the air, shattering it easily.<br/>He smirked for a moment, but frowned as he was assaulted by four<br/>smaller blows just afterwards. "You jerk! That was dirty!"<p>"So do something about it!" replied Taro as he readied another<br/>large rock by hooking it with his foot. He chuckled as Genryu rushed<br/>forward. "Stupid."<p>"Eat this!" snapped Genryu as he rolled under the intended strike.<br/>Taro had clearly not expected him to outmaneuver the projectile, but<br/>rather go through it.<p>"Damn!" he grumbled as he was forced to jump away from his arsenal<br/>of stones and landed nearby. "You don't think you're out of this yet<br/>do you?" he snarled.<p>"Come on then! Quit running away and fight!" snapped Genryu.<p>+++++++++<p>"Jeez, he's almost as bad as Akane is," snorted Ranma on the<br/>sidelines.<p>"Hey! What's that supposed to mean?" snapped the girl in question<br/>as she whipped her head around and glared at him.<p>"Boy very angry, Pantyhose boy cheat very much," commented Shampoo<br/>lazily.<p>"I don't recall there being a set of rules," grumbled Ryoga as he<br/>sat up from his lying position. He had recovered rather quickly from<br/>his last fight.<p>"Still, he's fighting dirty," agreed Akane.<p>"Ryoga is right, there are no set boundaries in a fight," agreed<br/>Ranma.<p>"Fear not, for I have once again returned from my battle with the<br/>lovely flower from China. Sadly, I could not bring myself to harm her,<br/>and was thus forced to lose honorably," said Kuno as he walked up to<br/>them. He was limping more than a little, and was also a little<br/>bowlegged. An ice pack was resting in his hand, pressed gently against<br/>his crotch.<p>"Hey Kuno," said Ranma without looking over at the boy.<p>"How goes the battle?" said the kendoist with a small frown at the<br/>familiarity the older boy was using.<p>"Good so far, we've beaten everyone but Xianghua," said Akane with<br/>a frown.<p>"Indeed, I hope that our endeavors are rewarded," said Kuno<br/>stoically.<p>"I agree," said Ranma calmly. His face had grown very serious<br/>suddenly.<p>"How is Kodachi?" asked Akane.<p>"My sister is still recovering, she is not permanently damaged<br/>though," replied Kuno with a small nod.<p>"Really? Too bad," muttered Akane under her breath.<p>Ukyo was too wrapped up in the fight to care about the<br/>conversation. "Kick his ass Genchan!" she cheered as her husband<br/>battled.<p>Ryoga glared at her for a moment and rubbed at his ear. He found<br/>nothing of interest among the group and turned back to the battle.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"You're too slow," chuckled Taro as he forced Genryu back with a<br/>few snap kicks.<p>The younger boy growled, and rushed forward punching and blocking<br/>the strikes. "I'll show you who's slow jerk!"<p>"Come on then!" cried Taro as he charged forward again. Genryu<br/>frowned and jumped straight up, forcing Taro to pass under him as he<br/>had already committed himself to a hard punch. The younger boy came<br/>down behind him in a kick aimed at the ground. He landed directly on<br/>the lines between two of the concrete blocks, sending both of them<br/>upwards at an angle, and throwing Taro off balance as he was almost<br/>thrown into the air by the force.<p>"Gotya!" said Genryu as he elbowed the boy in his back and sent<br/>him into the air and away from him.<p>Taro landed roughly on the ground and sat up, clutching his back<br/>angrily. "Why you little..."<p>Genryu was already in motion; the boy jumped into a kick aimed at<br/>Taro's head.<p>The Chinese boy growled and whipped out his arm, wrapping a nylon<br/>around the younger boy's leg as he passed. He shifted his weight and<br/>pulled Genryu over his head in a throw that slammed him face first on<br/>the ground.<p>"Damn!" said Genryu as he pushed himself up with his hands and<br/>back flipped away from the follow up strike. Another of the concrete<br/>blocks was shattered as a result.<p>"Who's running now?" taunted Taro as he took a short hop back<br/>after the blow.<p>"Jerk!" snapped Genryu as he kicked his leg out and caught Taro's<br/>shin.<p>"Ouch! You little...!" snarled the Chinese boy in irritation as he<br/>picked the leg up and rubbed it for a moment.<p>Genryu waited and moved into a combat stance again, popping his<br/>knuckles again by flexing his fingers as he waited. "Come on then! We<br/>haven't got all day!"<p>Taro smirked and stood back, waiting patiently while Genryu did<br/>the same. "You never had a chance."<p>"We haven't finished yet, Pantyhose," snapped Genryu in retort.<p>"Come on then!" snarled Taro as he rushed forward with an angry<br/>looking snarl on his face.<p>"Any time Underwear boy!" said the younger boy as he stepped back<br/>and blocked a swift kick intended for his ribs. Genryu countered with<br/>a punch that caught Taro's chest, forcing the older boy to stagger<br/>back.<p>"I barely felt that little girl!" snarled Taro as he recovered in<br/>an instant and kicked out at the younger boy's legs.<p>Genryu smirked as he hopped over the strike, he kicked out and<br/>managed to catch Taro's real attack, which was another kick that was<br/>meant to pick him out of the air. Taro grunted in pain as a resounding<br/>snap sounded from his ankle.<p>"Damn it!" snapped the older boy as he lay on the ground and<br/>slammed his palm onto the ground in frustration. "Damn you! I give up<br/>damn it!"<p>Genryu stood silently, waiting for Taro to continue to fight. He<br/>dropped his hands as the boy said that. "Huh?"<p>"Shut up and help me get up! You broke my ankle!" said Taro with a<br/>small sigh as he pushed his torso up with his forearms.<p>Genryu blinked, he had known about the break, even though he<br/>didn't intend for it to happen at all. Taro could take a lot of<br/>punishment, and he expected the boy to get up and keep fighting<br/>despite it. "You sure?"<p>"Yes! Help me up! I give up! This isn't worth fighting with a<br/>broken ankle. It's just a stupid tournament," said the older boy with<br/>a disappointed looking frown.<p>Genryu shrugged his shoulders and helped Taro stand up. The boy<br/>limped off the field with Genryu supporting him.<p>+++++++++<p>"You all right Taro?" asked Ranma as the boy sat down.<p>"I'll be fine in a few weeks," grumbled the boy in embarrassment.<p>Ukyo watched in horrified fascination as Taro reset his own ankle<br/>with an audible pop. The boy grit his teeth in pain and pulled a pair<br/>of pantyhose from his waist, he then tied a stick he had picked up<br/>from the ground to the side to splint it.<p>"Man, I hate when that happens," commented Genryu in sympathy.<p>"We've all dealt with it before," snorted Ranma lazily.<p>Akane and Ukyo glanced at him in surprise, neither of them saying<br/>a word.<p>"It'll be fine, don't worry about it," snorted Taro lazily as he<br/>sat back. The swelling had started to go down slightly now that the<br/>bone was back in place.<p>"Let me take a look at it," said a new voice. The group turned to<br/>see Tofu standing behind them with his arms crossed as he knelt down<br/>beside Taro.<p>"Whatever," snorted Taro as he extended his leg some to allow it.<p>"Hmmm, you've done this before," commented Tofu as he touched the<br/>leg gently.<p>"Comes with the territory," commented Ranma lazily. Tofu noted<br/>that most of the group was ignoring him, Akane included.<p>"Here." Tofu handed Taro a small bag of ice that he had gotten<br/>from one of the spectator's coolers on the way over. "That stick is<br/>fine for now, but I suggest you get this in a cast, or at least make a<br/>decent splint from some better wood."<p>"I'd planned on it," commented Taro as he glanced down at the man.<p>Tofu took out a pen and pad and scribbled a few things down.<br/>"Here, this is for some Motrin. Stop by a drugstore and pick some up,<br/>it'll only help a little with the pain, but it will reduce the<br/>swelling quite a bit."<p>"Sure thing doc, you should probably go back to your girlfriend<br/>now," said Taro with a rough snort as he took the prescription from<br/>the man.<p>Tofu frowned at that and looked over at Ranma for a moment. He<br/>narrowed his eyes as he noticed the boy idly playing with the cross<br/>that hung from his neck. He didn't appear to notice what he was doing,<br/>so he said nothing as he walked back to his own side of the field.<p>"Who's next?" asked Akane.<p>"I dunno," said Ranma.<p>+++++++++<p>Hakama stood up calmly and lifted the microphone to his lips as<br/>the cheering of the crowd died down again.<p>"An abrupt ending to a great fight indeed," he said with a hint of<br/>sadness in his voice. "But now, on to better things! Akane Tendo<br/>versus Ranma Saotome!"<p>+++++++<p>Ranma and Akane glanced at one another for a moment and stood up.<br/>Akane said nothing as she walked out beside him and took her position<br/>opposite him.<p>"I'm ready," she said as she put up her fists. Her face was<br/>completely serious, and she had a dead calm about her.<p>"I'll decide that," said Ranma with a small nod. "Let's see what<br/>you've learned, Akane."<p>The girl charged forward and spun into a flurry of kicks without a<br/>word. She screamed in a controlled battle cry as he backed away and<br/>blocked, weaving in and out of her blows, but striking with none of<br/>her own.<p>"Good!" he said calmly. "Get ready!"<p>Akane stopped her attack cold and put up her fists. Ranma was on<br/>her in an instant, his hands and feet a blur as he forced her back,<br/>closer and closer to the edge of the ring.<p>"Damn!" said Akane as she felt a blow strike her shoulder. She<br/>launched another attack at Ranma, ignoring a few blows that he managed<br/>to tag her with because of her drop in defense.<p>The boy said nothing as he began to strike and counter strike her<br/>moves. The pair jumped up and away from each other for a moment, Akane<br/>breathed heavily, while Ranma stood calmly, eyeing her carefully.<p>Akane tightened her stance for a moment, glaring at him with<br/>determination.<p>"Come on," said Ranma as he beckoned her with his hand.<p>"Kiyah!" cried Akane as she jumped into the air, Ranma followed<br/>and met her mid leap. They pair clashed, seeming to hover there for an<br/>impossible amount of time. Finally, they came down opposite one<br/>another.<p>Akane stood with her back turned to Ranma and her arms spread. He<br/>landed in a similar position, and turned to face her. His hand went to<br/>his side and he frowned as he clutched the spot for a moment. "Better<br/>than I thought," he muttered to himself.<p>Akane remained silent, and slumped to the ground.<p>Ranma walked over to her side and lifted her over his shoulder. He<br/>walked over to the sidelines again and lay her across the grass.<br/>Within moments she was awake again.<p>"I lost," she said. Strangely enough, she didn't look particularly<br/>upset about it.<p>"Hmm," said Ranma with a small nod. "As much as you wanted it, no<br/>amount of determination can make up for skill. You'll grow stronger,<br/>and there will be many other fights."<p>"Right," muttered Akane as she sat up. She remained silent after<br/>that and simply waited patiently for the next fight to begin.<p>+++++++++<p>Hakama stood up and spoke to the crowd again. "The final two<br/>matches are about to begin! Are you ready for the ultimate battle to<br/>begin?"<p>A roar of cheers answered him.<p>"Our next battle! The beautiful Chinese flower Xianghua, against<br/>the powerful warrior Genryu Saotome!" cried the boy as he worked the<br/>crowd into a frenzied mass.<p>+++++++<p>Ranma looked at his little brother and nodded at him.<p>Genryu stood up and scowled. Xianghua was already making her way<br/>into the center of the ring. She stood patiently, simply waiting for<br/>him. Her face was a cold scowl, almost completely devoid of emotion.<br/>Genryu noted that her eyes were not fixed on him, but his older<br/>brother.<p>"Good luck," said Ukyo as he started to slowly move towards her.<br/>He stopped and faced her. Both their eyes locked for a moment, he<br/>could read nothing from her.<p>"Genryu," muttered Ranma quietly. A slight wavering in his voice<br/>as he watched them stand there.<p>"I wouldn't worry too much," commented Taro.<p>Akane frowned and looked back at Ukyo and Ryoga. The pair were not<br/>very happy with the situation. Ryoga had seen Xianghua fight; he knew<br/>what she was capable of. Ukyo was just worried about her husband,<br/>although she was desperately trying to hide it, and failing miserably.<p>"Shampoo think boy losing very soon," commented the Amazon girl.<p>"It appears to be the truth," agreed Kuno as he stood just behind<br/>them, with the ice pack still over his crotch. "The woman is indeed<br/>fierce, no doubt she will make quick work of the young Saotome."<p>"In any case, we're about to find out," said Ranma.<p>Hakama stood and put his hand over his head, bringing it down to<br/>signal the start of the battle.<p>"Are you ready?" said Xianghua coldly.<p>"No. I can't," said Genryu as he hung his head and turned away<br/>from her.<p>"What are you doing?" said the woman as she relaxed her stance a<br/>bit.<p>"As much as I want to beat you, as much as I want to help my<br/>brother. I just can't. This isn't my fight," said Genryu as he walked<br/>out of the ring and looked down at Ranma. "This is between you and<br/>him."<p>Xianghua frowned, and lowered her fists as she stood in the middle<br/>of the ring. "Fine." She turned and walked away, the crowd booed<br/>angrily at the abrupt end of the round.<p>++++++++++<p>"What the?" said Nabiki as the crowd became unruly around her and<br/>Nodoka.<p>"What is my son doing?" muttered the woman as she watched him walk<br/>away.<p>"I haven't got a clue," said Nabiki in shock. "I think he feels<br/>that he shouldn't get involved. This is between Ranma and that girl."<p>"Why is that?" said Nodoka firmly.<p>"I'm afraid that information is quite expensive, or you could just<br/>ask him later," said the girl calmly. That was one mess that she<br/>wasn't touching with a pole.<p>Nodoka narrowed her eyes at the girl for a moment, and caught the<br/>hint. "I see."<p>Nabiki continued to roll the camera and frowned uncomfortably at<br/>the gaze the woman was giving her. "Looks like it's about to start."<p>"Indeed, my husband and I are going to have a long talk after<br/>today," commented Nodoka firmly.<p>++++++++++<p>Behind Shampoo, a white glow began to form from within the folds<br/>of the long bundle that rested by her side. She did not notice it, and<br/>had her eyes glued to the field.<p>Ranma had not waited for Hakama to start talking again; he simply<br/>stood up and started towards the center of the ring. His face was a<br/>cold scowl of pain and calmness. Everyone's attention was glued, and<br/>no one noticed the dark clouds that were beginning to form overhead.<p>"I can feel it," said Ranma to himself as he stared the woman<br/>down.<p>"That your death is near?" said Xianghua as she met him in the<br/>middle of the ring, already in a combat stance.<p>"Closer than you think, but I can't allow you to beat me just<br/>yet," said Ranma. His tone almost froze the air as he said this and<br/>put up his fists.<p>"I'm not giving you any choice!" snarled Xianghua as she jumped<br/>towards him with her fist extended.<p>"I only wish that I had one," said Ranma as he closed his eyes.<p>++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I know that you absolutely -HATE- me for this<br/>one. Hee hee!<p>
