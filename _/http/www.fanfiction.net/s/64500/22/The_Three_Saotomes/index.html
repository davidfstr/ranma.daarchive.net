</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 22<p>The tournament, round 1<p>++++++++++<p>Hakama stood on the edge of the ring, with a microphone in his<br/>hand as he read the first to names off his list. He waved his arm out<br/>dramatically as the excitement rose within the crowd gathered and<br/>grinned at the glare Ranma was giving him. The boy was wearing a dogi,<br/>with a T-shirt underneath the loose clothing.<p>"Our first battle of the day! Are you prepared? Ranma Saotome and<br/>Ono Tofu!"<p>The doctor stood up from his place and strolled into the ring with<br/>a frown on his face, he casually pushed his glasses up his nose as he<br/>waited patiently as Ranma approached him. The doctor was dressed in a<br/>plain brown dogi. "Hello."<p>"You've got no business here," said Ranma calmly as he looked the<br/>man up and down, equally relaxed.<p>"I'll decide that," replied the doctor calmly.<p>"No, I will. You're out of your league Tofu," said Ranma angrily<br/>as he stepped back in an offensive stance, not even bothering to bow.<p>"We'll see," said the doctor as he followed suit. "I won't let you<br/>hurt her."<p>"Who? My wife, or Kasumi?" replied the boy coolly. "Which one are<br/>you in love with doctor? Or is it both?"<p>Tofu remained completely calm. "Jealous?"<p>Ranma smirked at him; he opened his collar revealing a simple<br/>cross hanging from his neck. "Hardly."<p>Tofu stepped back in shock for a moment, and quickly regained his<br/>composure. "Where did you get that?"<p>Ranma's grin widened slightly. "Where do you think I got it? Do<br/>you think I don't know? You think I don't realize that you know every<br/>little detail about her? The way she looks, the way she smells? I've<br/>been watching you Tofu, you're pathetic, and she knows it."<p>"Shut up!" snarled the doctor as his composure began to wear down.<p>"Heh, I bet I know how she looks better than you do. After all,<br/>I've seen more," said Ranma quietly.<p>"You bastard! Die!" screamed the doctor as he charged forward.<p>Hakama blinked, and watched as the fight started. "Hey, not yet<br/>you idiots!" he cried in vain. After a moment, he simply gave up and<br/>sat back down.<p>+++++++++<p>Genryu watched in awe as Ranma said something to the doctor that<br/>completely blew his top. "Man, that guy is pissed."<p>Akane blinked and looked at him. "What did he say?"<p>"I dunno, but whatever it was, it really worked," said the boy<br/>with a shrug.<p>+++++++++<p>Ranma jumped back, analyzing the doctor's movements, and staying<br/>out of the enraged man's reach as best he could. "Say, didn't you take<br/>some sort of hypocritical oath or something?"<p>Tofu was beyond words though as he charged forward almost blindly.<br/>"Just die!"<p>Ranma ducked and spun on his heels, putting his fist into the<br/>doctor's gut and sending the man back a few feet.<p>Both of them rose up and glared at each other for a moment. Tofu<br/>had a scowl on his face, and he was almost completely red with anger.<p>Ranma merely cracked his knuckles and leveled a casual smirk at<br/>the man. "Too easy. You've been training with my wife haven't you? I<br/>recognize some of the style you've picked up Tofu."<p>The doctor's face went from red to white in an instant. He put up<br/>his fists and cursed himself mentally. "Damn it! How could I be so<br/>stupid? I just gave away everything about how I fight!"<p>"It was a rather effective lie I'll admit," commented Ranma as he<br/>realized the man was on to him now. "Or is it a lie? You'll never<br/>know, will you?"<p>"Of course it is! Kasumi would never do something like that!"<br/>snapped the doctor angrily.<p>"Oh no? How well do you know her doctor? Ever sat down and<br/>actually talked with her?" Ranma smiled as the man's face fell. "I<br/>didn't think so. You don't know anything about her do you? She's just<br/>a nice lady, who brings you cookies, and borrows a book on occasion.<br/>You haven't got a clue, or a spine for that matter."<p>Tofu growled and clenched his fists, this time he channeled his<br/>anger, focusing it carefully into the task at hand. "You don't know<br/>anything. I know enough to know she'd never do that with the likes of<br/>you."<p>"Really? Too bad, Mr. Tendo was pretty happy when I changed the<br/>engagement to her instead of Nabiki last night. The two of us weren't<br/>getting along very well. I think this time will be different." Ranma's<br/>smile went almost completely wild as he said this. "She's a real<br/>looker Tofu, got the cutest little birthmark on her...""<p>"Shut up!" roared Tofu as he charged forward again.<p>Ranma blocked the strike and backhanded the man in his face,<br/>sending him sprawling across the concrete on his back. He chuckled and<br/>slowly walked forward towards the man. "Sloppy."<p>Tofu looked up at him with a smile of his own this time. "Was it?"<p>Ranma stepped back, he growled as a tingling sensation began to<br/>run down his arm. "What the?"<p>"Martial arts isn't my only forte you know. I'm also a skilled<br/>practitioner of the art of Shiatsu. Very useful for medicine, but also<br/>quite deadly."<p>"I expected as much," said Ranma as he shook his head from side to<br/>side. "That tingles a bit, but it won't do much more to me I'm<br/>afraid."<p>Tofu's eyes went wide as he watched the boy flex his arm for a<br/>moment. "What? That's impossible!"<p>"Is it?" said the boy calmly as he glared at him for a moment. "I<br/>don't think it is." Ranma charged headfirst as the doctor did the<br/>same. They met in the center of the rink and locked up each pushing<br/>against the other in an attempt to force one another back.<p>++++++++<p>"Foolish, that young man has lost," said Cologne with a sigh.<p>"What mean?" asked Shampoo.<p>"Ranma has no ki, shiatsu is the manipulation of ki in most cases.<br/>There are a few things that should still work, such as veins, and<br/>certain muscles that can be effected by pressure. However, Ranma<br/>cannot be effected by any attack that would disrupt his chi field."<p>"So what?" muttered Mousse.<p>"The blow he just tried, was one such point. It would cut off the<br/>ki flow into his arm, thus forcing the body to believe that the arm<br/>had died. Quite effective, but useless against someone like that boy.<br/>The doctor doesn't seem to want to harm Ranma permanently with a more<br/>effective strike that would sever the muscles, or perhaps cut off the<br/>blood flow to his arm."<p>"Doctor not make good warrior," commented Shampoo.<p>"Indeed, his compassion will be his downfall, a pity really.<br/>Still, the real world is harsh indeed," agreed Cologne.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Ranma screamed in effort and pushed Tofu back forcefully. The<br/>larger man was thrown back a few feet, but maintained his balance.<p>"Come on doc, you can do better," snapped Ranma irritably. "I<br/>don't want to get out of this without a scratch. How else will I get<br/>Kasumi to nurse me back? She's got this cute little outfit she likes<br/>to wear..."<p>Tofu moved with surprising speed and managed to catch Ranma in the<br/>face. Sending the younger boy back a few feet.<p>"Better," said the boy as he wiped his chin with the back of his<br/>hand and smirked. "Let's finish this. I don't want this to take any<br/>longer than it has to."<p>Ranma ducked under a high kick and punched out quickly, catching<br/>Tofu in a sensitive area. The man fell to the ground clutching himself<br/>and Ranma merely stepped forward and picked him up by the hair on top<br/>of his head. Tofu's face was contorted in pain as he managed to open<br/>his eyes and look at the boy.<p>"Good night," said Ranma as he put his fist into the man's face.<br/>Tofu slumped down to the ground, out cold.<p>Ranma turned and walked away from the scene. He was feeling more<br/>than a little guilty for using Kasumi's necklace that way. The girl<br/>definitely wouldn't approve of it, and she'd probably die of<br/>embarrassment if she ever found out the things he'd said about her.<br/>"She'd never speak to me again," he said with a sigh as he stepped<br/>down and sat down with his brother again.<p>"What did you do?" said Genryu.<p>Ranma looked around and realized everyone was staring at him.<br/>"Nothing much, I just found a convenient weakness. Don't worry about<br/>it."<p>Taro seemed amused by this, and everyone else simply shrugged it<br/>off. Ranma pissing people off was not a new occurrence to them.<p>Akane shook her head in disgust. She used to have a crush on Tofu,<br/>he always seemed so strong, and was such a nice guy. This was a side<br/>of him she wished she'd never had to see. It was rather pathetic, and<br/>she felt she could have beaten him just as easily as Ranma did. "Men,"<br/>she said under her breath.<p>++++++++++++<p>"And the winner, by complete knock out. Ranma Saotome," announced<br/>Hakama lazily over the microphone.<p>Most of the crowd was relatively silent by this point, a cheer<br/>slowly began to rise from it that eventually roared as most of them<br/>began to realize what they were in for.<p>"Wow! Ranma beat the doc hands down!" said Nabiki in shock as she<br/>lowered her camcorder for a moment.<p>"So it seems," agreed Nodoka with a small frown.<p>"I wonder what he had on him to get him that worked up?" said the<br/>girl idly after the cheers died down around them.<p>"I hope I never find out," replied the woman calmly.<p>++++++++++++<p>Hakama stood once again and smiled at the crowd. "Since the<br/>opportunity was rudely taken away. I shall now explain the rules. They<br/>are quite simple really. No time limit, no ring out, the last man, or<br/>woman, able to stand wins. A true fight, to decide who is really the<br/>strongest." The crowd cheered once again and he waved the noise down<br/>with his hands. "Now, on to round two. I'm afraid I don't have a name<br/>for this one...ah, here we go." Hakama cleared his throat and then<br/>frowned as he read the slip of paper that was handed to him. "Asswipe<br/>the Mighty? What the?"<p>Matin jumped up from his place and glared at Ranma. "You! I'll get<br/>you for this you bastard!"<p>The crowd roared with laughter and Ranma glanced around for a<br/>moment in surprise. "What the?" His eyes fell on Genryu, who had a<br/>stupid looking grin on his face. "You didn't."<p>He shrugged apologetically and beamed with pride.<p>Ranma merely sighed and hung his head. "I guess it can't be much<br/>worse with him anyway."<p>Hakama had managed to shake off the incident and turned towards<br/>the three Amazons sitting in front of him. "And all the way from<br/>China, an Amazon warrior. Shampoo."<p>The girl stood up and walked into the ring confidently. Her head<br/>held high and the bonbori tightly in her grasp. Cologne had the bundle<br/>with the spear inside held across her lap as she watched the girl move<br/>forward.<p>"Aw, man. Why'd I get stuck with a girl," muttered Matin angrily as he<br/>looked her up and down for a moment. "And a cute one at that. My life<br/>sucks."<p>"What is talking about male?" snapped the angry Shampoo as she<br/>raised her weapon up and pointed at him with it.<p>"Look, why don't you just give up now? I don't want to fight you,<br/>I'm here for Ranma," said the boy irritably. His mind tried it's best<br/>to ignore her cuteness, and that sexy accent of hers. She was so<br/>exotic.<p>Shampoo stood dumbly, pointing at the now drooling and spaced out<br/>boy with her weapon still. "What? Is stupid boy having perverted<br/>thoughts?" she snapped at him.<p>Matin, who was completely oblivious to the world around him at the<br/>moment, merely nodded the affirmative.<p>"That dope," grumbled Akane out loud, just loud enough for them<br/>both to hear it.<p>That seemed to snap the boy out of his stupor. "Right, I'm in love<br/>already! Can't be doing things like that!"<p>Shampoo briefly wondered what he meant by that, but pushed it<br/>aside as Hakama raised his arm into the air and chopped down.<p>"Fight!"<p>The Amazon charged forward, slashing downward with her weapons<br/>hoping to catch him off guard.<p>Matin jumped back skillfully and frowned as the impact of her mace<br/>cracked the concrete. "Hey! Cut that out! That looks like it might<br/>hurt!"<p>"Is point! If no want fight, just take hit and stay down!"<br/>screamed the girl irritably as she attempted to hit him again. He<br/>dodged aside easily, keeping a good distance between himself and his<br/>opponent.<p>As time went on, Shampoo was becoming more and more frustrated<br/>with the boy. He simply dodged around her strikes, not taking a single<br/>blow from the weapons. The crowd was beginning to grow restless, and<br/>she was getting tired.<p>"Stupid man! Fight!" she snapped.<p>"Hey!" said the boy in retort as he dodged another strike. Shampoo<br/>smiled as her other bonbori homed in on his head. The boy's eyes went<br/>wide, and he slashed at her with his arm in a motion almost too fast<br/>for her to see at all. She staggered forward as her arm suddenly felt<br/>lighter and looked at the clean slice on the handle of her weapon. She<br/>looked up to glare at him for destroying her favorite weapon and saw<br/>the metal ball just as it reached her head.<p>She slumped to the ground and did not get up.<p>Matin dusted off his pants and smirked at her fallen form. "Well,<br/>looks like I win." He turned his gaze towards Ranma and smiled even<br/>wider, it was not a friendly gesture. Ranma knew what it meant. "I can<br/>play dumb too."<p>Ranma stood up and nodded at him, acknowledging his victory.<br/>Something about that last strike bothered him, he could have sworn<br/>he'd seen a flash, but the boomerang was still on the boy's back.<br/>"That's something I'd better watch out for."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Hakama stood as the battlefield was cleared once again. He smiled<br/>and spread his arms once again as the crowd cheered in reply to the<br/>match.<p>Cologne glared at Matin, who was sitting over with his group,<br/>smirking at her. Shampoo was laid out on the ground next to the old<br/>woman, with Mousse sitting next to her. The boy also leveled a glare<br/>at the boy, barely containing his anger.<p>"I'll get him for this..." he muttered.<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind boy," replied Cologne coolly<br/>without glancing away from Matin.<p>"What? How dare he do this to Shampoo? I'll tear him apart!"<br/>snapped the angry boy.<p>"What was he supposed to do? Lose on purpose? There is no kiss of<br/>marriage here, calm down. Your feelings for Shampoo are exclusive<br/>here," replied the old woman as she settled down and turned back<br/>towards the ring again.<p>Hakama picked up the microphone again. "Next in our exciting day<br/>of pure mayhem, is another battle of amazing strength! From our own<br/>country, Ryoga Hibiki!" The boy stood up and glanced around, moving<br/>away from the ring. Several of his teammates forcefully turned him in<br/>the right direction, sending him onto the concrete flat on his face.<br/>He stood up and glared at them for a moment, while dusting his pants<br/>off idly.<p>Hakama ignored the amusement of the crowd and smirked. "And from<br/>the visiting Chinese warriors, Mousse!"<p>The boy stopped glaring at the old woman for a moment and adjusted<br/>his glasses as he stood up and walked calmly into the ring.<p>Ryoga bowed to him, and Mousse did the same, eyeing his opponent<br/>for a moment carefully as he did so. Neither of them spoke a word to<br/>the other, they simply readied themselves and faced off in the middle<br/>of the ring.<p>"Begin!" cried Hakama as he swept his arm down and then sat down<br/>again. Ranma frowned as he noticed the boy's hand come to rest on top<br/>of the covered box at his side.<p>+++++++++<p>"I won't forgive you barbarians for harming my Shampoo!" said<br/>Mousse as he charged forward with an upward slash that caught Ryoga on<br/>his chin. "Fist of the White Swan!"<p>"What?" snapped Ryoga as he stood up and idly rubbed at the spot<br/>where the blow had connected. "You dirty..."<p>"A weapon?" commented Akane from the sidelines. "That boy is<br/>carrying a weapon!"<p>"Indeed," agreed Ranma coolly. He smiled to himself, she had no<br/>idea how much of an understatement that was.<p>Mousse jumped up in the air, throwing several objects to the<br/>ground around Ryoga. The lost boy opened his umbrella and kneeled down<br/>behind it to shield himself as several gas pellets exploded around<br/>him. He felt the impact of several objects against the umbrella and<br/>frowned as he stood up and saw several small throwing knives embedded<br/>or lying on the ground around him.<p>"Damn, I missed," grumbled Mousse as he landed in the middle of<br/>the cloud and frowned as he looked over at Ryoga for a moment.<p>"What the?" muttered the lost boy as his vision began to blur.<br/>Tears formed in his eyes as the gas started to take effect. "Tear<br/>Gas?" he muttered hoarsely.<p>"I'll finish this!" cried the Chinese boy as he jumped into the<br/>air. "The Hawk's Talons!"<p>Ryoga watched as the blur descended on him, it slowly became<br/>clear, revealing Mousse with a pair of clawed shoes on as he almost<br/>landed.<p>Ryoga's arm shot upward, with the umbrella striking the Chinese<br/>boy in his chin. Mousse was thrown into the air and came down hard<br/>across the field. He slowly staggered to his feet and glared at Ryoga<br/>for a moment angrily. "That was a good shot."<p>"Are you finished playing around with these stupid tricks? Or are<br/>we going to have a real fight?" snarled the lost boy angrily as his<br/>vision began to clear up.<p>"What? You dare call my techniques tricks?" snapped Mousse<br/>angrily.<p>"I haven't seen a real attack yet you loser," retorted Ryoga as he<br/>pulled the umbrella up in front of him and pointed it towards his<br/>opponent. "Here, let me show you a real attack."<p>"I'll show you!" snapped Mousse as he charged forward angrily.<p>Ryoga reared his arm back and threw the, now opened, umbrella<br/>forward. It spun like a Frisbee through the air and sailed past the<br/>Chinese boy, before turning like a boomerang just behind him. It tore<br/>a groove into the ground, and stopped just before it reached Ryoga.<p>Mousse froze as the weapon passed on both sides of him and raised<br/>his arms in a defensive posture. "Well, that's not bad. You don't have<br/>a weapon anymore though."<p>"I don't need one anymore," replied the lost boy as he charged<br/>forward like a bull.<p>"Fool!" snapped Mousse as he jumped up and back, waving his arms<br/>in the air and sending a hail of weapons at his opponent.<p>Ryoga continued to run, pulling a bandanna off of his head as he<br/>went. He swatted aside a few of the better aimed weapons and wove<br/>around the ropes and chains that now seemed to fill the air.<p>Mousse came down and gasped in shock as soon as he landed. Ryoga's<br/>fist connected with his chest, sending him flying back. The lost boy<br/>had met him on the ground, and was covered in ropes, a few of the<br/>weapons even hung from his arms as he stood there, still extended from<br/>the punch. He slowly relaxed as Mousse lay on the ground just outside<br/>the ring. The Chinese boy merely stood up slowly and frowned.<p>"You're stronger than you look."<p>"And you're not," replied Ryoga calmly. "Give up, you can't beat<br/>me."<p>"Bastard!" snarled Mousse as he jumped into the battle once again.<br/>A long spear came from within his robes and slashed down at Ryoga. The<br/>lost boy blocked the strike with is forearm and fell backwards. The<br/>spearhead looked ridiculous, nothing more than a wooden duck.<p>"Is this some kind of joke?" snapped Ryoga angrily. His frown<br/>deepened as a hole opened up from the duck's rear. Several small white<br/>objects fell from inside, and exploded as they hit the ground around<br/>him.<p>"Heh, so my techniques are weak are they?" chuckled Mousse as he<br/>looked at the smoke cloud that now billowed from the area where his<br/>opponent had once been standing.<p>Mousse stood gloating for another moment, and was about to turn<br/>away, when he noticed something move within the cloud. His hand shot<br/>up as it jumped out at him and stabbed through it with a small knife.<br/>He blinked and looked at the object he had caught and frowned deeply.<br/>"A bandanna?"<p>"You think that was enough to beat me? You're a bigger fool than I<br/>thought!" snarled Ryoga as he became visible as the smoke cleared. His<br/>clothes were singed slightly, but otherwise he seemed unharmed, if not<br/>a little dirty. In his hands, several bandanna's spun around, he<br/>released them all at once, pulling still more off of his head as<br/>Mousse was forced to jump back and dodge.<p>"How many of those things are you wearing?" snapped Mousse<br/>angrily.<p>"How many more toys do you have hidden in those robes?" replied<br/>Ryoga as he jumped up towards the Chinese boy.<p>Mousse grit his teeth in pain as one of the cloth disks swooped<br/>down on him from behind and slammed into the back of his head, sending<br/>him down from the air. Ryoga was waiting, and before he even hit the<br/>ground, Mousse's face connected with Ryoga's knee.<p>The fight was over.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"Impressive," commented Cologne as she hauled Mousse off to the<br/>sidelines.<p>Ryoga merely nodded and turned to leave the ring. He walked over<br/>to Ranma's side and sat down, not caring where he was.<p>"Not bad Hibiki," commented Ranma coolly.<p>"Of course not, I've been training to beat your little brother<br/>haven't I?" replied the lost boy coolly.<p>Ukyo clutched at Genryu's arm and glared at the boy for a moment.<p>"Eh? Who's this?" he said eyeing her for a moment.<p>"My wife," replied Genryu calmly.<p>Ryoga raised his eyebrow slightly and nodded. "Oh yeah? Good luck<br/>with him lady." It didn't sound all that insulting really.<p>"Whatever Ryoga," grumbled Genryu lazily.<p>"Well, I wonder who's next?" said Ranma as he looked up at the<br/>ring again. Hakama hadn't moved, and the crowd was still cheering from<br/>the end of the last fight. He paused as a shadow fell over him and<br/>turned slowly around. "Who?"<p>"You, must be Ranma," said Kodachi Kuno with a wry smile on her<br/>face. "Most impressive."<p>"Sister..." warned Kuno as he stepped up beside her.<p>"Late are you?" said Ranma as he turned away from them with<br/>disinterest.<p>"Yes, Mr. Hakama is aware that we would be, my sister enjoys being<br/>fashionably late to these events," commented Kuno with a rough snort.<p>"Indeed, I had also wanted to meet the man who would destroy our<br/>family blade in such a brash manner," commented Kodachi as she eyed<br/>him hungrily.<p>"Well now you have, now leave," snorted Ranma rudely. He did not<br/>want to deal with this right now.<p>"I cannot, for I must first win this title, and further humiliate<br/>my old rival. Her name is Akane Tendo, perhaps you know her?" Kodachi<br/>turned and glared at the now fuming Akane.<p>"Akane? You're going to fight Akane?" Ranma started to laugh out<br/>loud for a moment. "Get your hands off me, Akane's going to tear you<br/>apart little girl."<p>Kodachi seemed unperturbed by this announcement. "Oh my, such a<br/>wonderful personality. Brother, I want him," cried the girl as she<br/>fell down beside, the still sitting, Ranma and latched onto his back.<p>Akane looked at the scene in annoyance and turned away after a<br/>moment. It was a disgusting display on Kodachi's part, and she knew<br/>Ranma well enough that he wouldn't have anything to do with it.<p>Kuno almost attacked Ranma right there. "I forbid it!"<p>"Put that thing away Kuno, there's no way I'd go out with your<br/>sister," said Ranma calmly.<p>"So! You hate me?" cried Kodachi with tears in her eyes as she<br/>released him and fell to the ground with a handkerchief in her hands.<p>"Boy, you do catch on quick don't you?" snorted Ranma as he looked<br/>back at her indifferently. "I broke that sword for a reason little<br/>girl. Go away, before you make me angry."<p>Kodachi just looked up at him with wide eyes. The tears had been<br/>fake of course, but this... No one had ever spoken to her in such a<br/>way before. Her demure tears had always worked before, but this boy...<br/>he was different. She stood up calmly and started to walk away from<br/>the scene.<p>"Saotome! How dare you speak to my sister in such a way!" roared<br/>Kuno as he ran up and put his face into Ranma's.<p>"Would you rather I told her I liked her and married her? Or<br/>perhaps I should have just slapped her? Really Kuno, the way I handled<br/>that was in both our best interest, now go away. We have a battle to<br/>fight right now."<p>Kuno paused and calmed down visibly. "Very well, we shall settle<br/>this later Saotome."<p>"Fine by me," said the boy with another shrug. He sat down and<br/>waited for the next announcement.<p>It didn't take long.<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are ready to begin again! Next up for<br/>your personal enjoyment. Two devastatingly familiar figures! Kodachi<br/>Kuno, ruler of the Rhythmic Gymnastics Martial Arts Competition, and<br/>our own, Akane Tendo!"<p>Akane smirked as she stood up and glared at Kodachi. "That was<br/>fast," she commented idly.<p>"Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! Well, it seems we meet again little<br/>girl," said Kodachi snidely as she leapt into the ring acrobatically.<p>"I'll show you how little I am Kodachi," snapped Akane as she<br/>cracked her knuckles.<p>"We'll see about that," countered the gymnast with a dark smile<br/>appearing on her lips.<p>"Keep thinking that way, you're not in a gymnastics competition<br/>this time. This is my turf Kodachi, and you couldn't attack me before<br/>the match either."<p>"Yes, I know. Hakama would not divulge the identity of the other<br/>contestants to me. Such a boring man." Kodachi spun her ribbon in the<br/>air lazily for a moment and then smiled at Akane again. "I shouldn't<br/>have too much trouble though."<p>Akane merely smiled and punched her palm in anticipation.<p>Hakama raised his arm into the air, and brought it down. "Fight!"<p>++++++++++++<p>Three words I know you don't want to hear...To be continued...<p>Next time: The Tournament: Round 2<p>
