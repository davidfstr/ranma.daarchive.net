</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 27<p>Aftermath<p>++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo sat in the hospital waiting room, waiting with all the<br/>participants of the tournament. They sat around her, a few of them<br/>pacing nervously around the room. She looked up and saw Nabiki emerge<br/>from his room, clutching herself with a disturbed look on her face.<br/>"Well?"<p>"No change, the doctors think he'll pull through," muttered Nabiki<br/>quietly.<p>"Oh," said Akane with an uncertain frown on her face.<p>"My son will survive then?" said Nodoka with hope shining in her<br/>eyes.<p>"He's good at that," commented Taro with a slight smile on his<br/>face.<p>Ukyo looked at the boy for a moment and squeezed Genryu a little<br/>tighter. Her husband was looking at the ground, not saying a word as<br/>he rested in her arms.<p>"What about Shampoo?" said Mousse from the corner. "Any word at<br/>all?"<p>"She's fine," said a doctor who walked into the group with a<br/>friendly smile on his face. Tofu was standing next to him, with a<br/>white coat on as well. "She received only a few minor burns. She's<br/>very lucky to have escaped any serious injury."<p>Cologne appeared behind him, with the young Amazon at her side.<br/>Shampoo was silent, and had a tired look in her eyes.<p>"I have a question. How did the young man come across a technique<br/>like that? It was thought to have been lost, two thousand years ago,"<br/>she said as she motioned for Shampoo to sit down.<p>The girl did so, with a slightly pained look on her face. There<br/>were a few bandages on her arms and legs, but nothing serious.<p>"You'll have to ask him when he wakes up. He never told us how he<br/>learned it," said Genryu quietly.<p>"I see," said Cologne with a small nod.<p>"It appears that my son is a mystery to more than myself," said<br/>Nodoka as she mirrored the elder's gesture.<p>"I almost lost him," said Genma. He had been sitting in silence<br/>the whole time, with his face buried in his hands. He looked up at the<br/>group with an expression of horror on his face. "It was all my fault.<br/>I almost lost my son."<p>"He seems to feel that way," said Matin coolly. Everyone turned to<br/>look at him in shocked silence. "I've got my own score to settle with<br/>him, but I'll deal with it on my own terms. I never intended for him<br/>to die. When he's well again, I'll challenge him." He stood up and<br/>walked out of the room.<p>"What? You! Don't you have any respect at all?" snapped Akane as<br/>she jumped up and glared at him. Tears began to form in her eyes. "I<br/>thought you were an honorable man at least!"<p>Matin paused and turned his head to look at her. "Do you really<br/>think he'd forgive me, if I didn't challenge him again one day?"<p>Akane paused and looked at him in shock. "What?"<p>"There are some bonds, that are not spoken of. I will fight Ranma<br/>Saotome again one day, it is a simple fact," he said as he walked out<br/>of the room with a wistful smile on his face.<p>Tofu frowned and looked at Matin's retreating form. "My god, he<br/>knows."<p>"Knows what?" said Genryu as he went pale and looked up at the<br/>doctor.<p>"Genryu, Ranma will never be the same. He'll...never fight again,"<br/>said Tofu quietly.<p>Everyone looked at the man in shocked silence.<p>++++++++++<p>Xianghua stood on the rooftop of Nerima General, simply watching<br/>the town below silently. The cold night air blew by, blowing her hair<br/>around wildly. She said nothing, but simply watched the night.<p>"That, is what killed your brother."<p>The statement worked over and over in her mind. It was the truth,<br/>and she knew it. Now she remembered, she remembered the pain that she<br/>saw in his eyes every time they had fought together. She remembered<br/>every detail; the look on his face when she'd first attacked him,<br/>right up to the last moments of the tournament, when he'd almost died<br/>in her arms.<p>Tears flowed down her face freely as she stood in the moonlight,<br/>with nothing but the wind to comfort her. She fell to her knees and<br/>sobbed painfully, clutching at the gravel surface of the rooftop.<br/>"What have I become? What have I done?" she asked herself over and<br/>over.<p>Her chest became tight; she clutched at her chest with one of her<br/>hands. Still, she didn't care about the pain. The thing that had hurt<br/>her the most was the look in his eyes at the last moment. She knew<br/>that he still loved her, somehow, after all she had done, and he had<br/>never hated her. The look was always the same, no matter what his face<br/>told her, his eyes had never changed. Not even when they were full of<br/>the strange energy that somehow powered him.<p>The memory slammed into her with the force of a mach truck. She<br/>reared her head back and screamed, the sound echoed throughout the<br/>sky, drowning out the wind. Finally, she fell down, her eyes closing<br/>as she passed into unconsciousness.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Taro chuckled to himself in the waiting room. Everyone present<br/>turned to look at him in confusion; he ignored them and sighed for a<br/>moment before he began to speak, uncertain of why he was suddenly<br/>sharing this with them.<p>"I remember when we were in Hong Kong. Me, Genryu, and Ranma, we<br/>got together for a drink before he left for home."<p>Genryu went white as a sheet, and looked towards his mother<br/>nervously. "Um, Pantyhose..."<p>"Shut up boy," muttered Genma, glad for the distraction.<p>"We went into a bar, Persian Kitty or something like that. He<br/>wanted Genryu to experience something like that at least once in his<br/>life," continued the Chinese boy obliviously.<p>"Is that what it sounds like?" muttered Ukyo as she dug her nails<br/>into Genryu's shoulder for a moment.<p>"Yup, live nude entertainment. Nothing too bad though," said Taro<br/>wistfully. "You should have seen the kid, someone spilled beer on him<br/>at the beginning of the night. He was still as red as a beet the whole<br/>time. The women loved it, they were all over her."<p>Genryu hung his head and began to turn green.<p>"We didn't have too much trouble getting him to have a few drinks<br/>with us after that," said Taro wistfully. "Poor kid, he was sloshed<br/>after about a half hour."<p>"Oh my!" muttered Nodoka.<p>Taro chuckled again. "I think he made more money that night than<br/>any of the girls working there."<p>Ukyo was staring at Taro in shock. "You mean he..."<p>"Yup, only took ten drinks for him to go all the way," said the<br/>Chinese boy cheerfully.<p>"Pantyhose..." growled Genryu bitterly.<p>"You know, he was the first, and only real friend I've ever had,"<br/>said Taro as his face suddenly fell. "We had quite an adventure in<br/>China, kept running into each other. That night would have been the<br/>perfect end, if she hadn't shown up. The pair started brawling in the<br/>street; she almost got him, but threw him into a power transformer.<br/>That's how she got that scar on her belly. Scared the hell out of all<br/>of us too, us and half the population of Hong Kong as well. I hear it<br/>started a new religion, some sort of cult."<p>"Who?" said Nodoka as she looked at the sudden anger that had<br/>flashed on Taro's face.<p>"Mrs. Saotome," said Taro with a small chuckle.<p>Genma and Soun went completely rigid.<p>"I've never been to China..." Nodoka stopped suddenly and looked<br/>at the boy. Her face became very stern. "Who do you mean? Ukyo<br/>didn't..."<p>"No, I'm talking about Ranma's wife," said Taro coolly. "That girl<br/>he was fighting, when this thing showed up and sent everything to<br/>hell."<p>Nodoka turned towards her husband and frowned deeply. "What does<br/>he mean, husband? Explain yourself."<p>"I uhhh..." stammered Genma nervously. "The marriage was never<br/>validated! I didn't have anything to do with it! The boy saw that he<br/>had other obligations, and decided to marry Tendo's daughter, in order<br/>to uphold our honor!" He was silenced by a hard right across his face;<br/>Genryu stood over him, cracking his knuckles with a scowl on his face.<p>"Shut the hell up old man! You want to know what happened? Fine,"<br/>snarled the boy as he turned towards his mother. He began to recant<br/>the tale of what happened in China to his mother.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma opened his eyes. A bright beam of light shone inside the<br/>room from a space in the curtains. He shielded his face painfully and<br/>attempted to sit up, only to fail miserably. Pain exploded across his<br/>belly and he groaned as he fell back onto the sheets. Finally, he<br/>blinked slowly and looked up at the fuzzy outline standing over him.<p>"Am I dead?"<p>His vision slowly cleared up, and he saw Kasumi Tendo staring down<br/>at him. Strangely enough, she had a scowl on her face. He blinked for<br/>a moment, and she slapped him.<p>"Ouch! What the?"<p>"Don't ever do that to me or my family again," said the girl<br/>firmly. Her anger faded away into a gentle smile. "Welcome back Ranma.<br/>You've been missed."<p>The boy chuckled painfully and smirked. "Somehow I doubt that."<p>Kasumi smiled again, and stood up from her seat.<p>"Wait! How long have I been..."<p>"A week," said the girl with relief flooding her face. "The others<br/>will want to see you."<p>"Wait! It can wait a few more minutes," said the boy as he laid<br/>his head back. He looked down at his hand and held it up. The silver<br/>cross hung from his grasp still. "I told you I'd give this back to<br/>you."<p>Kasumi smiled again, and walked over to accept it. "I knew you<br/>would. They weren't able to pry it from your hand during the whole<br/>surgery, or even the week you've been resting here."<p>"I keep my promises," said the boy with a wry looking grin.<p>"I can see that," said Kasumi as she placed the cross around her<br/>neck again. It tingled against her skin for a moment as she gently<br/>placed it inside her blouse. She looked at the door nervously, and<br/>smiled back at him again.<p>"Go on, go get em. I guess I ain't dead, so I might as well get<br/>this over with," he said with a sigh.<p>"Of course," said Kasumi as she walked out the door calmly.<p>+++++++++<p>Ranma screamed in pain, as Nodoka crushed him in her grip. The<br/>woman backed away, with a heavy blush on her face as he lay in the<br/>bed, twitching in pain.<p>After a moment, Ranma paused and looked at the crowd in his room.<br/>"All of you?" he muttered.<p>The group consisted of all of the Tendo's, his mother, his father,<br/>Genryu and Ukyo, and Ryoga.<p>"Well, we're all they would let in right now," said Genryu with a<br/>slight blush.<p>"Oro?" muttered Ranma in surprise.<p>"The Kunos are both here, and those Chinese people as well," said<br/>Ukyo nervously.<p>"I didn't know you cared," said Ranma cheerfully. Both Nabiki and<br/>Akane were doing their best to pretend they didn't care. They both had<br/>the exact same scowl on their faces as the tried desperately not to<br/>look at him.<p>Tofu walked into the room and smiled gently at the group. "I'm<br/>glad to see everyone is all right after that mess." He pulled out the<br/>clipboard from the foot of Ranma's bed and looked at him<br/>apologetically. "I'm afraid I must ask everyone to step outside for a<br/>moment. You'll be allowed to see him in a short time. There are some<br/>things he needs to know, and a few examinations as well."<p>The group looked at Tofu for a moment, and shuffled away, leaving<br/>the pair alone.<p>"Hello Tofu," said Ranma with a neutral expression on his face.<p>"Saotome," said the man with a small nod at the boy. "I think it<br/>might be better if you hear this from someone else, considering our<br/>past."<p>"No. You tell me," said Ranma as calmly as ever. "I'm not angry<br/>with you Tofu, just...disappointed."<p>The doctor gave a weak smile at this. "It seems I'm not alone<br/>then." He shuffled through the papers for a moment and coughed.<br/>"Ranma, has anyone told you how serious your injuries are?"<p>"No. I almost died though. I'm smart enough to realize that," said<br/>the boy with a scowl forming on his face.<p>"I'm afraid it's much worse than that Ranma. I'm sorry,<br/>but...you'll never fight again," said the doctor calmly. "Your heart<br/>can't take the stress anymore. If you push yourself too hard, it will<br/>literally explode. I'm sorry. We have medications that will help, and<br/>you won't be helpless, but you'll be weaker, and you'll grow tired<br/>more easily as time goes on."<p>Ranma kept a straight face, his fists clenched the sheets of his<br/>bed and he simply glared at the wall. "I know. I knew this would<br/>happen eventually if I kept using that technique." He hung his head<br/>and sighed. "I'll still be able to teach at least?" Ranma's eyes were<br/>almost pleading.<p>Tofu had never seen such a look from anyone; it wasn't so much<br/>pity, and hope, as determination. It was clear that Ranma was still<br/>clinging to some aspect of his life. "That shouldn't be a problem,"<br/>said Tofu with a small nod. "You're still quite fit, and should stay<br/>that way. You just can't push your heart the way you have been<br/>anymore. It can still last you a long time Ranma, but you have to be<br/>more careful now." He stood up and turned towards the door. "I'll send<br/>the others in, if you're feeling up to it."<p>"Tofu, where is she? Is she all right?" said Ranma quietly.<p>The doctor never turned to face him, but Ranma saw his knuckles go<br/>white as he gripped the doorknob. "She's gone Ranma, she left for<br/>home. It was right after we brought you here."<p>Ranma nodded in silence. "Thank you doctor."<p>++++++++++<p>Nodoka Saotome stood next to Genma; both hung their heads as the<br/>stood at the foot of the bed. Ranma was simply glaring at them.<p>"Forgive me," said Nodoka as she bowed to him.<p>He turned his head away and looked out the window. "How could you<br/>do it to your own son? You would have fulfilled that contract, if I<br/>had not intervened when I did."<p>"I would have," agreed Nodoka. "I was foolish, in the time I have<br/>spent with my son, I see that I would have been wrong."<p>"Good," said Ranma quietly. "I'm glad you think that." He smiled<br/>at her and sighed. "You're just lucky I'm not the type to hold a<br/>grudge."<p>Nodoka's eyes went wide and she stared at the ground for a moment.<br/>"What?"<p>"If you ever do anything to threaten my family that way again, I<br/>will not hesitate, understand?" he said firmly. His gaze was as cold<br/>as ice as she looked at him in shock. "However, I will not deprive my<br/>brother of a family, just because of one stupid mistake. I would have<br/>killed this fat fool a long time ago if that was true."<p>"Son..." muttered Genma in a warning tone.<p>"You be silent!" snapped Nodoka as she gave him a gaze that<br/>stopped him cold. "I almost lost my whole family, not once, but three<br/>times because of your incompetence!"<p>"Three?" muttered Genma in shocked horror.<p>"You never had any intention of bringing him back to me!<br/>Especially after you got yourselves cursed! You nearly got both of my<br/>boys killed by some demonic monster because of your own stupid greed!<br/>And that damn contract you suggested! I regretted that decision from<br/>the day I made it! You preyed on my own youthful innocence!"<p>Genma shrank back as if he had been struck. "But, dear!"<p>"Shut up! I never loved you! I only upheld the honor of my clan,<br/>and foolishly believed that I might grow to love you in time! Look<br/>what you have done to me! All that I have had for almost ten years has<br/>been my honor!" Tears ran down the woman's face as she finally gave in<br/>and slapped him. "The divorce will go through husband, I cannot live<br/>like this any longer."<p>Nodoka turned and looked at her son, who was watching the events<br/>calmly. "I...I..." she stammered, searching for an apology, or<br/>explanation of some kind.<p>"I understand," said the boy with a small nod. He turned away from<br/>them and looked back out the window.<p>"Son?" muttered Genma in shock. Ranma had looked neither<br/>surprised, nor upset about the woman's announcement.<p>Nodoka began to pull at his arm, dragging Genma out the room.<p>"Mother, leave him here, and send Soun in," said Ranma calmly.<p>The woman paused, and faced her son. She released Genma's arm and<br/>left him standing dumbfounded.<p>Within a few moments, both men sat next to the hospital bed,<br/>watching him intently.<p>Finally, he spoke. "It's over. I'm breaking the engagement to<br/>Nabiki."<p>"What? You can't!" gasped Soun.<p>"He's right! We swore that the schools would be united by this<br/>union! You must marry a Tendo!" agreed Genma forcefully.<p>"Shut up!" snarled Ranma as he glared at them.<p>"The family's honor must be upheld," insisted Genma. He seemed<br/>completely fearless.<p>"He is right Ranma, this is a matter of honor," said Soun with an<br/>equal amount of anger in his voice.<p>"We could bring my mother in here to discuss this, with her<br/>katana," said Ranma. "If you two will remain silent, and listen, I<br/>will explain."<p>Genma and Soun seemed upset by this, but relented.<p>"The agreement has already been honored," said Ranma as he looked<br/>out the window.<p>Soun's face went white with shock. "You mean you, and my little<br/>Akane have eloped?"<p>"Good job boy!" agreed Genma.<p>"No one has married anyone," said Ranma coolly.<p>"But you said..." muttered Soun.<p>"I saw the contract, all that was stated, was that the schools<br/>were to be united. It never even implied marriage," said Ranma. He had<br/>yet to look back at them.<p>"I don't understand what you mean boy," said Genma as he frowned.<p>"Son, this is not acceptable," muttered Soun angrily.<p>"What you wish it to imply is irrelevant. Akane Tendo has learned<br/>both the Tendo and Saotome schools of Anything Goes Martial Arts,"<br/>said Ranma with a wry looking smile. "You might say I obeyed the<br/>letter of the law, if not the spirit. The schools have been united."<p>"That's..." muttered Tendo as he sputtered incoherently.<p>"Boy, this isn't acceptable! You must..."<p>"I must nothing, the agreement has been honored. You can be<br/>satisfied with that, or you can blow it out your ass. I've washed my<br/>hands of the matter."<p>"Boy, if you don't," growled Genma as he clutched his son's<br/>collar.<p>"You'll what? Kill me? Take everything I've ever loved away? Or<br/>perhaps just take me on another road trip so you can torture me some<br/>more?" He met the enraged Genma's gaze calmly and smirked. "What<br/>haven't you already done old man? There's nothing you can do to me<br/>anymore."<p>"Boy..." warned Genma.<p>"Heh, get out of my sight, or I'll have you removed," said Ranma<br/>as he placed his finger on the call button beside his bed.<p>Soun and Genma stood up and huffed away angrily. Ranma looked up<br/>at them one last time.<p>"Tell me how it feels to have your dreams crushed, old man."<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Man, Pop was pissed," muttered Genryu as he looked at his brother<br/>on the hospital bed. Ukyo was standing beside him, clutching his arm.<p>"Yeah, kinda nice having him like that instead of us," said Ranma<br/>lazily.<p>"Yeah," agreed Genryu with a nervous laugh. "So, they told you?"<p>"About my heart? Yeah, don't worry Genryu, it's not as bad as it<br/>sounds. I just can't go around blasting things anymore, that's all."<p>"You mean, you don't have to give up the art?" said the younger<br/>boy hopefully.<p>"I'll never be the same again, but yeah. I don't have to give it<br/>up, not completely," said Ranma with a small nod.<p>"Oh," muttered Genryu with obvious disappointment in his voice.<p>"So, how long do I have to wait until I have a nephew?" said Ranma<br/>cheerfully.<p>Ukyo and Genryu blushed heavily, neither saying a word.<p>"Not as long as I'd thought apparently," said the older boy with a<br/>slightly surprised chuckle.<p>"Shut up you jackass!" squeaked Ukyo.<p>"Come on, you don't really think something like almost dying is<br/>going to stop me from teasing you do you?" said Genryu with a small<br/>chuckle. "Good job little brother. So tell me, did you like it?"<p>"Man, he's still a jerk," muttered Genryu as he walked away<br/>towards the door.<p>Ranma was chuckling to himself as he watched the pair leave the<br/>room.<p>++++++++++<p>The next to enter was the Amazons. Shampoo nodded to him, and he<br/>returned the gesture.<p>"What brings you to visit me?" said Ranma cautiously.<p>"I have come to discuss the technique you used against the demon,"<br/>said Cologne as she sat down next to him. "I wish to know how you<br/>learned it."<p>Ranma looked her dead in the eyes and smiled. "I wouldn't tell<br/>you, even if I knew how. I almost died because of it. I'm lying here<br/>now, not because of my injuries in battle, but because of what that<br/>technique does to a human body."<p>"I see, it does lose some of its appeal," agreed Cologne as she<br/>looked him up and down. "I am more interested in who you learned it<br/>from."<p>"Oh, I get it. You're worried about Happosai getting his hands on<br/>this little technique?"<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes at the boy. "Among other things."<p>"And you're hoping I'll give away the name of my master, so you<br/>can send a few hapless girls to him."<p>"Actually, I was hoping I could just send them to you," said<br/>Cologne to the boy cheerfully.<p>"I can't train someone in the technique. I don't know how," said<br/>Ranma with a sigh.<p>"Pardon?" said Cologne cautiously. "You did learn the technique<br/>did you not?"<p>"The man who taught me this technique, won't be found unless he<br/>wants to be. He did something to my body in order to teach me to the<br/>technique, and I'm still not certain what it was."<p>"I see," said Cologne with a sigh. "I will leave you now. If you<br/>learn anything more, please contact me. I will return to China once<br/>again. I assume you know where to find us."<p>Ranma chuckled at this. "Fat chance old lady. The technique dies<br/>with me if I have any say in the matter. Unfortunately, I don't."<p>"Shampoo...grateful," said the Amazon girl with a slight bow to<br/>him. "She not destroy demon alone."<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes at the scene, but continued to walk<br/>away.<p>+++++++++++<p>Akane and Nabiki stood in the room side by side, each looking at<br/>one another in confusion. "You wanted to speak with us?"<p>"Yes, the engagement is gone," said Ranma as he smiled at them.<p>"Pardon?" muttered Nabiki in shock.<p>"The engagement is over, done, finito!" said Ranma cheerfully.<br/>"Aren't you happy?"<p>"What do you mean?" said Nabiki cautiously.<p>"I called the two of you in here together, because it involves<br/>both of you. Akane is now versed in the techniques of both the Satome,<br/>and Tendo schools. Therefore, the agreement has been fulfilled, thus,<br/>no more engagement."<p>"What?" stammered Akane in shock.<p>"I told you I had a plan Nabiki," said Ranma as he winked at her.<br/>"The old farts aren't happy about it, but there isn't much they can<br/>do. Next time, they'll be more careful about how they word their<br/>contracts."<p>"Th-that's..." stammered Nabiki, uncertain about what to say or<br/>do. "Good I guess," she managed after a while.<p>"Yeah, you won't be seeing to much of me anymore. I'm probably<br/>going to be moving back home, and I doubt if your father will want me<br/>around much. Neither one of the idiots is happy with this."<p>"Yes, but our family honor is intact," agreed Nabiki. "You don't<br/>have to torture us anymore, and we can get on with our lives."<p>"You catch on quick," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"But..." said Akane with her eyes growing wide with shock.<p>"Huh?" said Ranma as he looked at her.<p>"I haven't learned...everything yet! I..." she looked completely<br/>shocked at what was coming out of her own mouth. "I still haven't beat<br/>you damn it! I'm going to be better than you ever were!"<p>Ranma smirked at her stumbling. "Good for you."<p>"You're going to teach me how!" she snapped angrily as she grabbed<br/>his collar.<p>"Oh?" muttered Ranma as he arched his eyebrow slightly.<p>"Damn you Saotome! I'm not going to back out now! I've still got a<br/>score to settle with you, and it isn't going to end like this! I won't<br/>let it!"<p>Ranma returned her gaze confidently. "You still think you can keep<br/>up with me?"<p>"Of course! You're nothing but a bed-ridden cripple! I'll wipe the<br/>floor with you! Just you wait!" Akane released him, and walked out of<br/>the room slamming the door behind her.<p>"You know, my sister was never this colorful before you came<br/>along," commented Nabiki snidely.<p>"We all change Nabiki," said Ranma calmly.<p>"She does care you know, I've never seen her act this way with<br/>anyone. I'm not sure if it's pure hate, or some sort of twisted love,"<br/>said Nabiki as she followed after her sister. "You'd better not hurt<br/>her."<p>"That's up to her," said Ranma in reply.<p>Nabiki merely shut the door behind her, not giving any indication<br/>that she had heard him.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Saotome, we have brought roses to speed your recovery," said Kuno<br/>as he stood next to his sister. They both held him a bouquet of<br/>flowers, one red, the other black.<p>"Um, thanks...I think," muttered Ranma quietly.<p>"Fear not, my sister has ensured me that there are no poisons<br/>within these dark and morbid signs of her affections," commented Kuno<br/>as he noted Ranma nervously eyeing the black roses.<p>"Great. It's nice to see you're both not hurt too badly..." lied<br/>Ranma.<p>"It has come to my attention, that you can no longer carry on our<br/>battle of honor, due to your condition. I shall quietly accept your<br/>surrender, and carry on the battle no more," said the boy stoically.<p>"Hey, look," said Ranma irritably.<p>"I shall await your recovery Ranma! Unfortunately, this lowly<br/>hospital would not allow me to personally nurse you back to health,"<br/>said Kodachi as she blushed demurely.<p>"Look, I appreciate you coming and all, but..." said Ranma as the<br/>pair continued to ignore him.<p>"The mighty Blue Thunder of Furinkan High is merciful indeed! Weep<br/>for joy, for your life has been spared, by my most noble and righteous<br/>heart!"<p>"Please accept this kiss, until we can be reunited once again!"<br/>said Kodachi as she leaned in to the prone boy's face.<p>"Hey!" cried Ranma as he desperately pressed the call button over<br/>and over.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Pantyhose Taro looked out over Nerima, a wistful smile on his face<br/>as he watched the sun set in the horizon. "Only one name left,<br/>Happosai. It seems I've found you at last old man, I hope you're<br/>ready." He turned his head and looked back at the hospital in the<br/>distance. "See you around Saotome."<p>He jumped away, vanishing into the city.<p>+++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Home Sweet Home...<p>
