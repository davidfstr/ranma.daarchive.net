</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 26<p>Pain.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Xianghua and Ranma moved slowly, circling one another patiently.<br/>Each waiting for an opening in their opponents defense. The sun was<br/>moving down below the horizon in the distance, opposite the buildup of<br/>dark clouds that was forming in the east.<p>"I'll have my revenge at last, Ranma," said the woman as she moved<br/>forward first. Charging him head on.<p>"Not yet," he replied in an emotionless monotone as he deflected<br/>her jabs easily and stepped back. "There's a storm coming."<p>"I noticed! It won't arrive in time to save you this time,"<br/>snarled Xianghua as she spun into a kick that Ranma almost lazily<br/>ducked under.<p>"So it seems," commented Ranma as he stepped back a bit and<br/>avoided a few more strikes.<p>Xianghua growled at the lazy attitude he seemed to have adopted.<br/>"Dodge this you bastard!" she screamed as she brought up her arms. The<br/>metal bracers on her forearms flared with a pink energy and blasted a<br/>ball of pink light at him.<p>Ranma merely sidestepped the attack, but it caught his shirt and<br/>ripped a large hole in the sleeve, twisting his body as it passed. He<br/>paused and stood silently for a moment, in an almost relaxed pose.<br/>"You should know the same thing never works twice on me."<p>"Are you finished fooling around now? Can we finish this?" said<br/>the woman with a rage burning in her eyes.<p>"As you wish," said Ranma coldly.<p>Xianghua moved in again, this time, her punch was met with a sharp<br/>kick to her stomach. Both blows connected, sending the pair flying<br/>apart.<p>Ranma skid across the concrete, while Xianghua hopped back<br/>precariously for a moment before regaining her balance.<p>"Not bad," said Xianghua.<p>"I see Tofu has been instructing you," commented Ranma as he<br/>rubbed at the tingling sensation that had started on his face. "You<br/>should have learned from his fight. That won't work against me."<p>"What business of yours is that?" snapped the woman.<p>"He leveled his gaze on her again, and frowned deeply. "We don't<br/>have much time. I've got something that I have to do in a short<br/>while."<p>"You should have kept your schedule open. Death last for quite<br/>some time," replied Xianghua.<p>"I know, but I'm in no hurry to die. This fight, is another<br/>matter," the boy jumped up into the air, and away from her. He landed<br/>a fair distance back and clenched his fists at his side. "Are you<br/>ready this time?"<p>"That was a nice warm up, let's get started," replied the woman<br/>snidely.<p>Ranma charged.<p>++++++++++<p>"He sounds different," commented Nodoka with a slightly surprised<br/>frown.<p>Nabiki nodded as she held her camera on the fight. Ranma did<br/>indeed sound different, his voice was deeper, some how more mature. He<br/>had seemed to be on the same level of maturity as his younger brother<br/>before, always with a sort of sickening cheer about him. Now, she<br/>could see his real age, he looked and sounded like a, very serious,<br/>eighteen year old man now.<p>Nodoka stared at the fight, unable to tear her eyes away from her<br/>son. Her hands were clutching the wrapped blade in her grip tightly.<br/>There was something more to this fight; she had no idea what it was<br/>though. Something was going on with her son and this woman that was<br/>deeper than the tournament. "Is this the reason...?" she muttered to<br/>herself under her breath.<p>Nabiki spared her a quick glance and raised her eyebrow slightly<br/>at the comment. She quickly lost interest and returned her attention<br/>to the battle.<p>+++++++++++<p>"What is he doing?" said Taro in confusion. "He could end this in<br/>an instant."<p>"They almost killed each other last time," commented Akane.<br/>Thankfully things seemed a bit tamer this time around. She wasn't sure<br/>if it was intentional, or they just had gained more skill.<p>"Ranma isn't winning," said Genryu as he glared at the battling<br/>pair.<p>"Seems pretty even to me," commented Ukyo.<p>"No, boy is right. Ranma not win fight this way," said Shampoo<br/>with a sagely looking nod.<p>Mousse had been strangely silent thus far; he crossed his arms and<br/>made a grunting agreement. Japan was definitely more interesting than<br/>he had expected.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"You're getting weaker," said Xianghua with an evil looking smile<br/>creeping onto her face.<p>Ranma glared at her silently, his chest heaving as he breathed<br/>roughly and stepped back into a wider stance. "Damn it..." he muttered<br/>to himself after a moment.<p>"You used up too much energy fighting the boomerang boy," said<br/>Xianghua as she realized what was happening to him. "You're mine this<br/>time."<p>"We'll see. I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve," countered<br/>Ranma as he took up a strange stance in front of her. His feet were<br/>spread out across the ground in a horse stance, and he pulled his<br/>hands up to his chest. He closed his eyes and began to breathe slowly.<p>"Giving up?" snarled Xianghua as she charged forward.<p>"Hardly," said the boy calmly. The woman was forced to jump back<br/>as the ground at his feet began to glow with a light blue.<p>"What the?" she stammered as a tingling sensation began to run<br/>through her body. "What is that?"<p>"An electromagnetic field. The Earth constantly generates<br/>electrons, I'm collecting them," said Ranma calmly.<p>"What?" stammered Xianghua as she rushed forward again, intent on<br/>stopping him.<p>"I wouldn't recommend that," commented the boy calmly.<p>Xianghua ignored him, and stopped just in front of him. She was<br/>thrown back by an arc of energy that slammed into her chest from the<br/>power field around him. She was lifted her off the ground and laid out<br/>across the ground.<p>"I warned you," commented Ranma.<p>"Take this!" screamed Xianghua as she recovered and stood up. She<br/>thrust her arms forward again, creating another blast of pink energy.<p>This time, Ranma was the one sent sprawling across the ground.<br/>"Damn!" He rolled across the ground as he landed and twisted back onto<br/>his feet again.<p>"So, it seems you aren't as invincible as you claim," snorted<br/>Xianghua coldly.<p>"I never said I was, come on," snapped Ranma as he slowly stalked<br/>forward towards her again.<p>Xianghua met him halfway, and the pair exploded in a flurry of<br/>punches and kicks. Neither one seeming to have the advantage. Finally,<br/>the woman staggered back as Ranma landed an elbow to her face.<p>The boy pressed his advantage, rushing forward and slamming his<br/>fist into her gut, before spinning into a kick that caught her across<br/>her face. She was thrown onto her side, and rolled away from a strike<br/>that was meant to catch her on the ground.<p>"Bastard! I won't lose this time!" she screamed as she rushed<br/>forward, seemingly unharmed by the assault.<p>"What the?" said Ranma in shock.<p>++++++++++<p>"Aiya! Woman train in breaking point technique?" said Shampoo as<br/>she watched the scene.<p>"Seems she's had some kind of endurance training," commented Taro<br/>lazily.<p>"Huh?" said Ryoga and Genryu in unison.<p>"If you get hit enough, it stops hurting so much," explained Taro.<p>"Seems like it," agreed Mousse.<p>++++++++++<p>Xianghua rushed forward, catching Ranma across his face with a<br/>left hook. The boy staggered back and braced himself. She did not<br/>disappoint him.<p>Xianghua was merciless as she beat her former lover back. He managed<br/>to remain standing catching most of the blows with his forearms and<br/>legs, but she still pounded him back. Finally, her assault ended as<br/>she spun into a back kick that caught him dead in the chest.<p>Ranma was thrown back, and landed on his back roughly.<p>"Are you ready to die now?" snorted the woman as she stalked<br/>towards him.<p>"No...not yet," he gasped as he painfully rose to his feet again.<br/>"I can't die yet."<p>"You don't have a choice, husband," snarled the woman angrily as<br/>she raised her fist as she stood over him.<p>"NO!" snapped Ranma as he jumped up, catching her in the jaw with<br/>his head.<p>Xianghua cursed as she staggered back. Ranma was as kind as she<br/>had been, rushing forward to press his advantage. This time, he held<br/>nothing back. Power started to crackle down the length of his arms,<br/>creating a flash of energy as each blow struck her.<p>Xianghua grunted in pain, patches of her clothes exploded as they<br/>came in contact with his fist, leaving a bruise behind with each blow.<br/>Ranma screamed as he worked his arms relentlessly, forcing her to<br/>stagger back a little more with every strike.<p>Finally, they reached the edge of the ring. The world had gone<br/>completely silent to both of them, nothing but the fight mattered now.<br/>Ranma stopped his attack and glared at her with madness in his eyes.<br/>The energy crackled across his body, his hair stood upright, and a<br/>strange glow formed in the back of his pupils as he glared at her.<p>"Damn you..." she managed before falling to one knee. "I won't be<br/>beaten!" Her fists slammed into the concrete at his feet, the bracers<br/>on her arms flared to life at the same instant. The ground exploded<br/>beneath the both of them, sending a shower of rocks in every<br/>direction.<p>+++++++++++<p>Everyone stood silent as the dust cloud generated by Xianghua's<br/>attack hid the pair from view. It seemed to hang in the air for an<br/>eternity, slowly fading away around the edges.<p>Finally, a blue light could be seen within the ring, followed by a<br/>smaller, pink light.<p>Someone in the back of the crowd screamed.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma stood glaring angrily at Xianghua, completely unharmed by<br/>her desperate attack. Her body was now covered in the pink glow, but<br/>it was rough, and fading away quickly.<p>"You've lost," he said calmly.<p>"I'm not down yet," she snarled. Her body was covered in bruises,<br/>patches of her clothes were torn away, leaving very little behind to<br/>cover her. She was not in good shape, one arm hung limply at her side,<br/>and dirt and blood seemed to cover her skin.<p>Ranma was beaten, but very lightly. The cold blue glow that had<br/>formed in his eyes seemed to shine off of his irises, giving him a<br/>surreal air of power.<p>"Your energy is fading away, I'm not even at half strength yet.<br/>Xianghua, you've lost," he said as calmly as ever.<p>"Never!" she screamed as she moved back into a battle stance<br/>again.<p>Ranma closed his eyes; a single tear ran down his face. "It's<br/>over."<p>"No!" screamed the woman as she charged him again.<p>Ranma became aware of several voices, silently calling out to him.<br/>The sky above roared angrily, and Xianghua's charge seemed to be in<br/>slow motion for a moment. Everything around her was moving, the crowd,<br/>the wind. Slowly, his eyes went wide and he screamed in desperation.<p>"Xianghua! Look out!"<p>The Chinese girl saw him burst forward in an amazing display of<br/>energy. She felt his hands on her shoulders, and his leg pushed<br/>against her belly before she could react. He leaned back, pulling her<br/>down with him and rolled onto his back. Finally, she felt herself<br/>being thrown into the air as he kicked her up and back as he landed,<br/>throwing her clear across the ring, and off the other side.<p>Slowly she staggered to her feet, a look of complete shock on her<br/>face. "What?"<p>"Ranma! No!" screamed Genryu as he stood up from directly beside<br/>her.<p>"What?" she repeated in confusion as everyone around her seemed to<br/>be in a panic. "Who?" she managed after a moment of uncertainty.<p>The Amazon girl was rushing towards the ring, a long glowing spear<br/>in her hands. The other martial artists were either being held back by<br/>those calm enough to realize what was happening, or standing in shock.<p>Slowly she turned to look at the ring again. There was Ranma,<br/>lying on the ground. An armor clad warrior standing over him, with a<br/>sword thrust into his side, pinning him down on the ground. The boy<br/>was clutching the blade, glaring up at the thing hatefully.<p>Ranma Saotome screamed, and the world went bright white, all sound<br/>seemed to be sucked out of the air in an instant. It was followed by a<br/>resounding boom, that tore through everyone around the ring, sending<br/>them to their knees.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Nabiki noticed the people rushing by around her in a panic. Ranma<br/>and Xianghua were still locked in combat, the dust cloud slowly fading<br/>away around them. She paused as those shoving by her became more and<br/>more forceful. She turned and saw Nodoka, now clutching her unsheathed<br/>katana beside her. A look of complete terror on her face. Nabiki<br/>slowly turned the camera towards the middle of the crowd. Standing<br/>there, was a black and gold clad suit of armor, hacking his way<br/>through the quickly thinning spectators as he made his way towards the<br/>ring.<p>"My god!" she whispered in horror. She panned the scene, revealing<br/>a long red trail behind the thing as it moved forward, without slowing<br/>once. "It's true..." she managed after a moment.<p>Nodoka didn't seem to notice, she was pulling on her shoulder,<br/>forcing her back. Thankfully, the woman's katana afforded them both a<br/>little more room than the rest of the terror stricken spectators.<p>Finally, she lowered the camera as the thing approached Ranma and<br/>Xianghua. It raised the blade over its head as it walked up behind the<br/>woman.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Shampoo stood up in an instant, working with practiced ease as she<br/>unwrapped her spear. The thing had cut a path through the crowd, and<br/>was now bearing down on Ranma and Xianghua.<p>"Shampoo!" stammered Mousse as he turned towards her.<p>She decked him, sending him sprawling across the ground<br/>indifferently. "Stay out of way." She walked calmly into the ring,<br/>watching absently as Ranma was pinned to the ground after saving the<br/>woman's life. Her eyes narrowed as the thing looked up at her, its<br/>eyes glowing red for a moment.<p>"Shampoo kill you now," she said simply.<p>Then, Ranma screamed. She couldn't hear the sound that came from<br/>his mouth. The only thing she remembered after seeing him open his<br/>mouth was a white light. Then the burning sensation, that was quickly<br/>quelled as the protective aura of the spear surrounded her body.<p>Finally, the light faded away, and the ringing in her ears<br/>lessened slightly.<p>Ranma Saotome was standing, or more precisely hovering, just in<br/>front of the thing. The aura around his body was the only light in the<br/>entire field now. The lights that had been set up for the tournament<br/>were now nothing more than a few shattered, and sparking, glass<br/>shards.<p>His face was contorted in a mask of painful anger, both fists were<br/>clenched tight as he stared the thing down, thunder rumbling in the<br/>sky above him only heightened the effect. His eyes were now nothing<br/>more than two glowing blue spheres of power.<p>He let out an inhuman cry of anger and moved with impossible<br/>speed, rushing at the demonic armor.<p>She only frowned, she had seen this before, in the mountains of<br/>China. Now, her Great Grandmother could not deny what she had seen.<br/>Here it was right before her, the legendary technique that no one had<br/>mastered for almost two thousand years. The Fist of the Thunder God.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Die," said the demon as it glared up at Ranma fearlessly. The<br/>bloodied Katana still in its grip.<p>Ranma merely roared incoherently, he blasted forward. The thing<br/>could not keep up with his speed. The young Saotome boy faded in and<br/>out of his slashes easily, striking with a resounding boom with each<br/>blow. The electrical power dissipated as it struck the black aura,<br/>leaving the thing unharmed.<p>Ranma spun in the air, weaving around the monster, striking with<br/>seemingly endless power all across it's body, desperately searching<br/>for a weakness.<p>The thing merely stood there, swiping at the air almost lazily.<br/>"You cannot harm me! I am eternal!"<p>"Shampoo not think so!" said the Amazon as she rushed forward,<br/>stabbing at the thing with her spear. The two aura's clashed, fighting<br/>for dominance, neither gave any, creating a stalemate between the two<br/>powers.<p>The demon ignored Ranma, and the boy jumped back hovering just<br/>above the ground, with a slightly confused frown. Instead it slashed<br/>the katana at Shampoo, who also ignored the strike. The weapon stopped<br/>cold by her own protective aura.<p>Ranma grunted and raised his hands. Small beams of electric energy<br/>shot from his fingertips, attacking the black aura of the demon. The<br/>energy bounced away harmlessly. The boy snorted in frustration, and<br/>raised his hands into the sky for a moment. He screamed in rage and<br/>lowered his hands.<p>Shampoo and the demon were both thrown apart as another lightening<br/>bolt slammed into the ground between them. Ranma was laughing madly,<br/>as he floated above the scene, repeating the attack over and over.<p>Wai Mei Kai simply stood there, each bolt of power preventing him<br/>from moving, but not doing any real damage.<p>Shampoo was screaming with her hands clutched over her ears. She<br/>had fallen to her knees and the spear lay on the ground in front of<br/>her. After a moment she stood up, staggering for a moment as Ranma<br/>finally stopped his assault. She shook her head and hefted the spear<br/>over her shoulder for a moment, glaring at him and the demon.<p>+++++++++++++<p>On the sidelines, the martial artist were standing in a group, a<br/>fair distance away from the battle.<p>"My god," said Tofu in shock.<p>Matin, who had Mousse draped over his shoulder, merely nodded in<br/>agreement.<p>"What is he?" stammered Akane.<p>"He is human. I never thought I would see this. I did not believe<br/>my Shampoo when she told me of this, but I can see it is true," said<br/>Cologne.<p>Xianghua spat a small amount of blood on the ground and glared at<br/>the two fighters in the ring for a moment. "Ranma's done this to me<br/>once before."<p>"You survived?" commented Cologne in surprise.<p>"Barely. What I want to know, is what the hell that thing is,"<br/>Xianghua pointed at the demon with a cold scowl on her face.<p>Genryu interrupted the pair, Ukyo was cowering in terror in his<br/>arms. He looked up at the two women for a moment, barely able to tear<br/>his eyes away from the scene to answer.<p>"That, is what killed your brother," he said calmly.<p>+++++++++<p>"Is not working!" said Shampoo as she glared at Ranma for a<br/>moment. She turned away from him with a disgusted grunt as he ignored<br/>her and continued to pour energy into the horrible thing that was<br/>slowly moving towards them.<p>Ranma was nothing more than a berzerker at the moment, throwing<br/>energy at his target relentlessly. Occasionally a small bolt of<br/>lightening would strike him again, ensuring that he did not run out of<br/>power. The demon was unharmed by the attacks of both teens though, and<br/>merely walked after them almost methodically. Shampoo's aura, and<br/>Ranma's speed kept them both safe for the time being though.<p>How long that would last was the question.<p>+++++++++++<p>Hakama stood silently on the side of the ring, simply watching the<br/>scene in a fascinated horror. There was nothing he could do really,<br/>and the panicked mob was opposite him on the field, running into the<br/>darkness, or lying on the ground in shocked horror. The conditions had<br/>gone from bad to worse, spectators had rioted immediately once they<br/>began losing limbs and lives to the demon.<p>He watched both Shampoo and Ranma battle the thing with a sort of<br/>calm fear, slowly his hand went to the covered box at his side.<br/>"Saotome..." he muttered quietly.<p>That was when the rain began to fall.<p>++++++++++<p>Shampoo looked on in horror as her ally changed. It happened the<br/>instant the rain began to pour down on them. Ranma arched his back,<br/>his clothes tearing to shreds as his body grew and expanded. The cry<br/>that escaped his lips was no longer human as he reared back, seeming<br/>to land on all fours, despite the fact that he never touched the<br/>ground.<p>The worst thing of all, was that his eyes never changed. They<br/>still were nothing more than bright spheres of energy, surrounded by a<br/>cold blue fire. His mane seemed to be alive, twisting and writhing in<br/>the air along his neck.<p>The demon looked on indifferently, slowly stalking towards the<br/>much larger target. It's blade rising into the sky as it neared it.<p>Ranma shook his mane and reared back on his hind legs, snorting<br/>angrily. As he came down again, a ball of blue light erupted from his<br/>mouth, slamming into the demon's chest, sending him back a few feet<br/>and nothing more. Finally, another bolt of lightening struck again.<br/>The energy in the air seemed to rise dramatically. Shampoo could feel<br/>the increase across her skin, causing goosebumps to travel up and down<br/>the entire length of her body.<p>The huge black stallion stood still for a moment, walking over to<br/>her side calmly. It lowered its head down to her neck, still glaring<br/>at the monster before them.<p>"Shampoo understand," said the Amazon as she grabbed a handful of<br/>his mane.<p>"Child! What are you doing! Get off that cursed beast!" snapped<br/>Cologne from the sideline. She watched in terror as her Great<br/>Granddaughter pulled herself onto the horse's back. "You'll be killed!<br/>Don't be a fool!"<p>The young girl glared at the demon that still moved slowly and<br/>methodically towards her. She hefted the spear at her side,<br/>determination burning in her eyes. The blue and white aura's<br/>surrounding the pair flowed in and out of one another, seeming to<br/>merge, while fighting for dominance. Shampoo switched back to her<br/>native tongue, not bothering to look back at her Great Grandmother. "I<br/>know."<p>"Shampoo," stammered Mousse as he slowly rose from where she had<br/>left him at the beginning of the fight. He shook his head, wiping the<br/>water that had woke him from his face in confusion.<p>The horse reared back on its hind legs one final time, turning to<br/>face the demon, who now simply stood waiting for them. It's blade<br/>drawn, and held defensively in front of it.<p>"Is good day to die? Yes?" asked the Amazon on his back.<p>Ranma snorted, and charged forward.<p>What followed was an image that would never be forgotten by any<br/>who witnessed it. Shampoo raised the spear over her head and let out a<br/>war cry as Ranma reared back on his hind legs one final time, just in<br/>front of the demon. Wai Mei Kai, slashed upwards with his blade,<br/>attempting to halve both of them in a single stroke. When Ranma came<br/>down, so did the spear, and another bolt of lightening that easily<br/>dwarfed all the others that had struck thus far.<p>There was an explosion of energy, a white light brighter than a<br/>thousand suns turned the entire valley into day once again.<p>Then, only silence.<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome looked up at the sky for a moment, the clouds were<br/>dissipating quickly, revealing an endless sea of stars in the<br/>distance. "Did I get him?" he wondered out loud as he slowly sat up,<br/>staggering to his feet. "I'm...a man?" The air around him was a haze,<br/>nothing more than a steam cloud that rose from the scorched ground<br/>that had once been the battlefield. He shook his head and smiled as he<br/>glanced around the shattered concrete. Pieces of metal, some of them<br/>shining with a gold tint, were glittering in the moonlight. The crowds<br/>were gone, a few bodies lying on the ground where they had once been,<br/>and the small band of martial artist around the edges of the ring were<br/>all that remained. "Heh, it's over," he said as he slumped slightly,<br/>clutching at his belly in pain.<p>That was when she appeared before him again. Xianghua, she was<br/>standing in the moonlight, staring at him.<p>"Well? Shall we finish our fight?" he said as he put up one hand,<br/>keeping the other clutched against the wound on his belly. "I'm<br/>ready."<p>"You're in no condition to fight," she said to him quietly.<br/>"You'll die if you fight me now."<p>"Heh, that's the plan," he quipped as he swayed for a moment.<p>"Why?" she said finally, emotion filling her voice suddenly.<p>"I've been a real bastard, somebody has to do me in. Right?" he<br/>said with an almost joking tone. "Come on, let's get this over with.<br/>My calendar is finally clear." He fell to his knees and spit up a<br/>mouth full of blood. "Damn it."<p>Xianghua rushed up, pulling him into her arms. "No!"<p>"Sorry, Little Mountain Girl, looks like you don't get to kill me<br/>after all," he said with a wry grin. With that, his head rolled back,<br/>and his eyes closed.<p>"Ranma! No! Wake up!" she cried desperately as she shook him<br/>violently for a moment.<p>"Noooo!" screamed Genryu as he rushed to the scene from his place<br/>at the sidelines. "Ranma! Wake up! Damn you!" he gasped with tears<br/>flowing down his face. He buried his face in the older boy's chest,<br/>simply crying. Xianghua was still holding her husband's body,<br/>seemingly numb as she stared at the scene in shocked horror.<p>"He is gone, my son," said Nodoka quietly as she knelt down beside<br/>her living child. Emotion tore through her own features as well, she<br/>was barely in control, looking down at the dead body of her son.<p>Xianghua paused, scanning the field desperately for a moment.<br/>"Tofu! Get up here damn it!"<p>The man was already on his way. "Move away from him," he<br/>instructed firmly. After a moment he grabbed Genryu's hands, forcing<br/>them onto the wound on the elder boy's belly. "Apply pressure." He<br/>took out a small flashlight and quickly went over the body, checking<br/>his eyes and pressing his fingers against the boy's neck. "He's still<br/>alive, barely. I can't keep him that way here. We're going to lose<br/>him, there's nothing I can do."<p>"No, we aren't," said Hakama as he calmly walked into the scene.<br/>He moved his hands, and four men rushed around the fallen Saotome. "I<br/>have no intentions of allowing him the comfort of such a noble death."<p>"Where?" stammered Tofu as the four medics worked around Ranma,<br/>pulling him onto a stretcher.<p>"Do you really think we can hold an event like this without<br/>alerting some sort of medical staff?" snorted the boy in an almost<br/>business like manner. "He will be taken to Nerima General immediately.<br/>I'm far from finished with this one." Hakama turned away, leaving the<br/>group alone as Ranma was carried towards a waiting helicopter that had<br/>just landed a few hundred yards away.<p>++++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo stood over the hospital bed with her fiance in it. He<br/>had just come from surgery, and was still on the brink of death.<br/>Bandages covered his body, and machines forced oxygen into his lungs<br/>with a rhythmic pumping. A large bag of fluid hung beside her, slowly<br/>pouring fluids into his arm. She frowned deeply as she looked at the<br/>machines that were keeping him alive.<p>"All it would take is a simple flick of a switch, and you'd be out<br/>of my life, Saotome," she said to him quietly. "Just pull on a single<br/>cord, or adjust the flow of those medications they have stuck in your<br/>arm. You'd be gone forever. You couldn't torture my sister anymore,<br/>you couldn't endanger my family any longer."<p>She placed her finger on top of the main power switch of the<br/>machine that was forcing him to breathe. "So why can't I?" She hugged<br/>herself and turned away from him. "Damn you. I hate you."<p>"Just one switch, and she'd destroy the only friend her older<br/>sister had made in years. She'd destroy her younger sister's<br/>tormenter, who had gone out of his way to make sure her dreams became<br/>a reality. She'd destroy the son of a mother who had somehow found<br/>hope in finding her family again, even after meeting the terrible man<br/>that her son had become." Nabiki glanced back over her shoulder.<p>"Ranma, I hope you..." she paused and frowned, uncertain about<br/>what to say. "See you later you jerk."<p>++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Tales of Adventures Past...<p>What happened? What's Hakama up too? What the hell happened to<br/>Shampoo? Argh! So many questions...heh...you'll just have to wait.<p>
