</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 28<p>A New Beginning.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma walked slowly down the front steps of the hospital. A<br/>walking cane in his hand supported some of his weight as he slowly<br/>made his way down with his family.<p>Nodoka stood beside him, with Genma opposite her, Genryu and Ukyo<br/>trailed a little behind him, and both had unreadable expressions on<br/>their faces.<p>"Don't look so down little brother, I won't be this weak for<br/>long," commented Ranma as he gave a quick glance back at the boy.<p>Genryu blushed and turned his head away. "Sorry."<p>"You shouldn't be, you think I don't know what a pitiful sight<br/>this is?" snorted the older boy casually.<p>"Right," grumbled Ukyo sarcastically.<p>"Son," said Nodoka.<p>"I'll be back to normal soon enough," said the boy calmly as he<br/>continued to walk away. He stopped when a black limousine rolled to a<br/>stop in front of him on the street. "He wouldn't," muttered Ranma<br/>angrily.<p>The door opened and a familiar figure stepped out, two large<br/>bodyguards stood on either side of him as he strolled up to the<br/>crippled looking man.<p>"Hakama," snarled Ranma angrily.<p>"Now, let's calm down a bit shall we? You're in no condition to do<br/>anything at the moment," said Hakama calmly. "I merely came to inquire<br/>about your condition."<p>"I can still do it you know," snarled Ranma, as he looked the boy<br/>dead in his eyes. "If I do, I'll just have to make sure I take you<br/>with me."<p>"How quaint," snorted the boy as he looked Ranma up and down for a<br/>moment. "I can see you're just as spiteful as ever."<p>"More so now," agreed Ranma with a smirk forming on his face.<p>"There is no animal I cannot tame, much less an upstart like you,"<br/>said Hakama coldly. "I'll have my 'wild horse' yet."<p>"Over my dead body," said Genryu as he stepped up beside his<br/>brother. Ukyo was just behind him, an angry scowl on her face.<p>"If it comes down to it. You're too weak for my taste just yet.<br/>I'll catch up with you in a few months, and we'll settle this," said<br/>Hakama as he looked the trio up and down for a moment. Genma and<br/>Nodoka stood a comfortable distance away from them. The boy brushed<br/>off the lapel of his suit for a moment and smirked back at Ranma.<p>"I don't think so," said Nodoka as she stepped down from beside<br/>Genma. "Whatever problem you have with my son, it ends here and now."<p>"Problem?" said Hakama with a cheerful looking smile as he turned<br/>towards her. "My dear woman, I want him alive. He will be mine, I will<br/>tame him yet, and he will be my most magnificent conquest."<p>"Pardon?" muttered Nodoka with a shocked expression. All the color<br/>drained from her face in an instant.<p>Hakama chuckled and turned away, walking back towards his car.<br/>"I'll be seeing you, Saotome."<p>"Yes," agreed Ranma. "You will."<p>"Who was that man?" asked Nodoka as she turned towards him.<p>"Just an annoying thorn in my side, nothing for you to worry<br/>about," said Ranma as he started walking again.<p>++++++++++<p>Shampoo stood on the deck of the ship that was carrying them back<br/>to China. The sea was calm, and a wind blew from the west that made<br/>her hair billow out behind her as she simply watched the waves.<p>The spear was wrapped, and slung across her shoulder like a<br/>firearm, the glow long since gone from the metal. Her eyes searched<br/>the horizon, looking for any sign of her homeland.<p>"Shampoo," said Mousse as he walked out onto the deck behind her.<br/>"Perhaps we can have a romantic moment here, looking out over the<br/>ocean..."<p>She ignored him completely as he strolled up beside her. He was<br/>grinning like an idiot, mentally praising his luck at finding such a<br/>perfect moment. He spread his arms to embrace her, thinking he would<br/>sweep her off her feet.<p>"If you touch me, you will never make it home. Leave me alone,<br/>you're disturbing my meditation," said the girl calmly. She didn't<br/>even bother to look at him.<p>Mousse grabbed her, hugging her tightly in his arms. "But...I love<br/>you! How can you be so cold? How can you turn me away like that?"<p>Shampoo moved like a striking cobra, her arm snapped up in an<br/>instant, catching his neck. Mousse gasped as he found himself lifted<br/>off his feet easily. She turned to face him, her features completely<br/>calm.<p>"I warned you Mousse," she stated.<p>The boy's glasses fell off, and vanished into the water below as<br/>she moved him over the side of the deck. He attempted to gasp for air<br/>desperately, clutching at her arm in desperation.<p>Shampoo's features never changed, she continued to watch the<br/>horizon as the boy struggled in her grip. Slowly, his struggles<br/>slowed, becoming weaker and weaker. His eyes began to turn red with<br/>blood and his chokes slowed.<p>"Shampoo! Bring him on the deck and release him at once!" snapped<br/>Cologne as she bounded towards them.<p>The girl responded by casually tossing him back without turning<br/>away.<p>Mousse slumped down, gasping desperately for breath. His vision<br/>faded in and out as he struggled to rise to his knees.<p>"Leave me," said Shampoo coldly to the both of them. "I have much<br/>to think about."<p>"Indeed," agreed Cologne as she pulled Mousse along, watching her<br/>cautiously.<p>"Shampoo..." whispered Mousse. He found himself thrown against the<br/>wall roughly. His head hit with a metallic clang and he jumped up,<br/>rubbing the spot in irritation.<p>"If you ever touch Shampoo again, I will not stop her from killing<br/>you," said Cologne as she glared at him.<p>"I can't see!" muttered Mousse as he felt around himself for a<br/>moment.<p>"Your eyes will return to normal soon enough. Another few seconds<br/>and you would have died boy," snorted the elder. Her face softened<br/>somewhat as she watched him flounder about pathetically. "Stop being<br/>an idiot, you were almost blind anyway."<p>"Shampoo! Why?" said the boy as he finally gave up and fell to his<br/>knees again.<p>"She is not the same person we once knew Mousse. You'd best<br/>remember that, she has seen and done things you cannot imagine,"<br/>snorted the old woman in disgust.<p>"But...I still love her!" pleaded the boy.<p>"And she does not love you. There is nothing you can do about<br/>that," said Cologne calmly.<p>"She does! She just..."<p>"If I had not stopped her, you would be dead boy," said Cologne<br/>with an icy tone. "Shampoo did not even bat an eye when she held you.<br/>There is no place in her heart for you anymore."<p>"But..." stammered Mousse.<p>"The times of the past are gone Mousse. Shampoo is a hunter now,<br/>she has lost much of her kindness. Some of it will return in time, but<br/>she will never be the same girl again. Her childhood is over, and she<br/>is a woman, and a warrior now. You will not be able to chase her as<br/>you have been, and escape with a mere beating."<p>Mousse hung his head, for the first time she could remember,<br/>Cologne saw real fear in his eyes.<p>"I..."<p>"It is over Mousse, you have lost. If you do not give up your<br/>foolish quest for my Great Granddaughter's heart, you will die."<p>"The I'll die!" snapped the boy as he stood up.<p>"If you must continue, give her some room. I do not care for you<br/>personally boy, but I also don't want to explain what happened to you<br/>to your mother. She is not open to you now, leave her alone for a few<br/>weeks, or at least until we get back to China."<p>"She will love me," insisted Mousse.<p>"Dig your own grave boy, but don't make me a party to it. Until we<br/>reach China, you are not permitted to speak with Shampoo. On pain of<br/>death," said the old woman as she turned away from him.<p>Mousse merely slumped down against the wall, he had no idea what<br/>to do, and he still couldn't see. Both Amazons left him there for the<br/>remainder of the trip, and he did not move.<p>+++++++++++<p>Two weeks later...<p>Ukyo Saotome sat behind her grill, Ranma was sitting in front of<br/>her with a smirk on his face as he watched Genryu move around the<br/>restaurant. The boy was waiting on the few customers inside the shop.<p>"Quit starin will ya?" said Genryu irritably.<p>"I'd never think you'd get into this business thing. It suits<br/>you," said Ranma cheerfully. "You'd do better if you did it as a girl<br/>though."<p>"I haven't been able to talk him into it," muttered Ukyo absently.<p>"I don't see you pulling no carts around!" retorted Genryu.<p>"So, how are things going?" said Ranma as he turned towards Ukyo.<br/>"You've been keeping my brother all to yourself over the past few<br/>weeks."<p>"We've got a business to run," said Ukyo with a shrug.<p>"It was a joke, jeez," snorted Ranma as the girl put a plate of<br/>Okonomiyaki in front of him.<p>"I know, we've...adjusted pretty well," said Ukyo as she smiled at<br/>him weakly.<p>"Love life doing okay?" asked Ranma.<p>"None of your business!" cried Genryu from across the room.<p>"I know, I just like getting you all worked up. Both of you turn<br/>the most interesting shade of red whenever I bring it up," said Ranma<br/>with a small chuckle.<p>"Jerk," snorted Ukyo as she turned away.<p>"Well, I suppose. You didn't expect something like near death to<br/>change me that much did you?" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"I suppose not. How are you feeling anyway?" asked Ukyo.<p>"Better every day, a few more weeks and I won't need this<br/>anymore." Ranma tapped his cane against the counter top. "I should be<br/>able to start training again after that."<p>"Hey! Great!" said Genryu. "I can't wait to pound on you for bein<br/>such an ass!"<p>"We'll, I've got to admit, this little sister thing is kinda new<br/>to me. I've had practice though," said Ranma as he looked at Ukyo and<br/>grinned.<p>"Hey! What's that supposed to mean!" cried Genryu.<p>Ukyo giggled slightly and covered her mouth.<p>"Ah, I've still got it," said Ranma as he winked at her.<p>"Right," said Ukyo as she rolled her eyes.<p>"Well, I definitely didn't get my wit from my father, must be<br/>mom's side of the family," said Ranma as he picked at his okonomiyaki.<p>"How is that fat fool doing anyway?" said Ukyo.<p>"I dunno, he's still living with Soun. I'm not exactly welcome<br/>there. Neither one of the idiots is speaking to me, and frankly, I'm<br/>much happier," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Pop hasn't changed much," said Genryu lazily.<p>"I'm surprised he hasn't tried to get you out of your marriage,<br/>and into another stupid engagement," said Ranma casually. "Mom won't<br/>speak to him at all, and she definitely won't let him near me."<p>"Ranma..." muttered Genryu uncomfortably.<p>"Don't worry, I'll go talk to the moron after I'm able to defend<br/>myself a little better. Those two are dumb enough to try a shotgun<br/>marriage."<p>Ukyo nodded. "I hear Akane is coming to see you a lot."<p>"Yeah, stupid pig headed..." muttered Ranma. "She's a good<br/>student, and shows up every afternoon. I'm not sure what old man Tendo<br/>has to say about that, but she's devoted to kicking my ass once I get<br/>better."<p>"A lot of people are," agreed Ukyo lazily.<p>"Yeah, kinda nice to have a break," said Ranma with a snort. "I'm<br/>thinking the only reason I haven't heard from Soun or Genma is because<br/>she comes over so often. Those idiots are expecting love to bloom<br/>between us or something."<p>"Yup, that sounds like something Pop would do," said Genryu as he<br/>walked up next to them and leaned against the counter.<p>"Mom wants you two over for dinner tonight," said Ranma as he<br/>looked at the pair for a moment as he finished his meal.<p>"Sounds good to me," replied Genryu with a small shrug.<p>Ukyo growled at him for a moment. "We've got things to do here."<p>"You don't know your mother in law very well. She won't take no<br/>for an answer. Whatever you're supposed to be doing, it will be here<br/>when you come back. She hasn't seen her son for almost ten years<br/>little sister," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"I suppose...and don't call me that," said Ukyo with a small<br/>frown.<p>"Why not? It's true," said Ranma calmly.<p>"Jerk," said Ukyo as she turned away from the grill for a moment.<p>"You're running out of insults," commented Ranma as he stood up.<br/>"I've got to get back, Akane should be showing up soon. I'll see you<br/>two lovebirds later then." He twirled the cane around in his hand as<br/>he strolled towards the door.<p>++++++++++++<p>"You're still overextending," said Ranma as he watched Akane go<br/>through her kata from the porch of the Saotome home. He walked over to<br/>her and moved her body slightly, correcting her mistake. His hand<br/>brushed against her chest for a moment as he did so.<p>"Pervert," muttered the girl angrily under her breath.<p>"Maybe I am," replied Ranma as he stepped back and nodded for her<br/>to begin again.<p>Akane did as she was instructed, growing faster and more intense<br/>with each motion.<p>"Calm down," said Ranma as he sat down again. "You've got focus,<br/>but it can work against you if you get to worked up."<p>"What do you mean?" said the girl as she paused and looked over at<br/>him.<p>"To quote my father, 'A martial artist must be aware of his<br/>surroundings, as well as his opponent. Becoming too focused can result<br/>in missing something important, such as another attacker, or a stone<br/>that could be used to your advantage."<p>Akane snorted at this and sat down in the grass. "I thought you<br/>didn't like him."<p>"Genma Saotome is a lot of bad things, but he is an excellent<br/>teacher," said Ranma with a shrug.<p>"Maybe I should get him to train me," replied the girl snidely.<p>"He wouldn't do any better than your father did, but for different<br/>reasons," replied Ranma.<p>"What? Are you saying my father is a poor teacher?" snarled Akane<br/>as she rose to her feet.<p>"Calm down. Your father couldn't bring himself to train you<br/>properly, out of fear of hurting you. My father would just slack off,<br/>because you're a girl. He wouldn't think you could take it."<p>"Pig," grumbled Akane.<p>"Among other things, yes," said Ranma with a small nod. "Our<br/>culture in general tends to think of women as weaker beings. It's not<br/>completely his fault."<p>"What happened to you then?" said Akane as she sat down again. She<br/>still didn't look particularly happy with him.<p>"I met women who were just as strong as I was, if not stronger,"<br/>replied the boy with a shrug. "I tend to not be influenced by other's<br/>opinions as much as most people. I prefer to draw my own conclusions,<br/>based on experience. Which is one of your faults as well."<p>Akane turned her head away from him for a moment, but didn't<br/>argue.<p>"You've certainly lost some of your bark over the past few weeks,"<br/>commented Ranma.<p>"I'll never beat you if I don't learn more," said Akane as she<br/>glared at him for a moment. "Like you said, my father isn't going to<br/>be enough, and you're all I've got otherwise."<p>"I see," said Ranma with a small chuckle.<p>"Ranma! You have a guest," said Nodoka as she walked out of the<br/>home for a moment.<p>"Really?" said the boy in surprise.<p>"Hello," said Kasumi as she walked up behind the woman and smiled.<p>"Kasumi?" muttered Akane in surprise. "What are you doing here?"<p>"I've been visiting Ranma. I got used to talking with him while he<br/>was staying with us," replied the girl as she sat down next to him.<p>"We used to keep the same hours, I'd spend a lot of time talking<br/>with her in the morning," said Ranma with a shrug.<p>"It hasn't been the same since he left," said Kasumi cheerfully.<p>Akane frowned; she didn't like the idea one bit. Until something<br/>Nabiki said crept into her mind. "How many friends do you think Kasumi<br/>has?" She growled in the back of her throat for a moment, and remained<br/>silent.<p>++++++++++<p>Akane finished her kata, and walked into the home. Ranma and<br/>Kasumi were chatting cheerfully together at the table. They were<br/>sitting opposite one another, and had tea set out between them. She<br/>walked up to the pair and sat down.<p>"Kasumi, you've been coming over here often?"<p>"Huh? Of course I have, where did you think I'd been going?" said<br/>the girl as she blinked and looked at her sister.<p>"Kasumi stops by on the way to the store Akane," said Ranma with a<br/>small chuckle.<p>"But..." said the younger girl as she looked down at the table in<br/>disbelief.<p>"It wouldn't surprise me if no one noticed you were gone an extra<br/>hour or two, Kasumi," said Ranma with a small chuckle.<p>"Oh my," gasped the older girl as she put her hand over her mouth.<br/>"You mean?"<p>"If Akane didn't notice, I'm pretty sure those two idiots didn't<br/>either." Ranma laughed for a moment as he noticed the expressions on<br/>both girls' faces.<p>"Don't call my father an idiot!" snapped Akane as she punched<br/>Ranma in the back of his head.<p>Ranma fell face first onto the tabletop and clutched at his chest.<br/>"Oh! My heart!" He stood up and staggered around over dramatically.<br/>"Oh! It's the big one! I can feel it!"<p>Kasumi giggled, while Akane merely scowled at him.<p>"Well, I suppose we're done training for the day Akane," said<br/>Ranma as he looked up at the clock. "Genryu and Ukyo are both coming<br/>over tonight for dinner, mom's gonna be busy in the kitchen till then.<br/>I'll walk you to the store Kasumi."<p>"Thank you," said the girl with a small smile.<p>"No problem," said Ranma with a shrug.<p>"I'm going too," said Akane quickly. She jumped up and stood<br/>between the pair.<p>Ranma blinked in surprise, but Kasumi didn't seem to notice.<p>+++++++++++<p>Inside the store, Ranma hung back a bit with Akane, while Kasumi<br/>did her shopping blissfully.<p>"Watch yourself," said Akane coldly.<p>"Come here," said Ranma as he stopped and waited patiently.<p>Akane strolled up to him and looked him dead in the eyes.<p>"I know what you're worried about," said Ranma calmly. "I've got<br/>no interest in her that way, Akane. I just lost my wife, and I'm not<br/>about to start something new now. I doubt if I'll be able too for a<br/>very long time."<p>Akane's features softened for a moment, but she continued to stare<br/>at him. "Keep your hands to yourself."<p>"I'm not going to promise you anything. I like Kasumi, and we're<br/>good friends, in a few years, things might change. In the short term<br/>though, you've got nothing to worry about."<p>"She doesn't need you," replied the girl coldly, anger seethed<br/>inside her voice.<p>"She knows that, and doesn't need you to protect her from me,"<br/>said Ranma calmly. "Akane, I'm not looking for love, and she knows<br/>it."<p>The younger girl said nothing and turned away from him. Ranma<br/>remained behind, and watched her leave as calmly as ever. He sighed<br/>and shook his head for a moment before continuing to follow them.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Goodbye Ranma, it was nice seeing you again," said Kasumi as she<br/>bowed to him as they parted ways outside the store.<p>"Same here Kasumi," said the boy as he returned the gesture. "I<br/>suppose you'll be coming by again tomorrow?" He looked directly at<br/>Akane as he said this.<p>The girl merely nodded and turned away from him coldly.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ryoga Hibiki was trapped. He glared at the fallen wall of rubble<br/>that now held him inside the small cave he had used to duck out of the<br/>rain. "Damn. I'm trapped," he growled as he attempted to move some of<br/>the debris out of the way. For every stone he moved, two more replaced<br/>it.<p>A voice outside the cave called to him. "I may have a way for you<br/>to escape. Here take this." A scroll fell through a small opening at<br/>the top of the blocked entrance.<p>"What? Who's there? What is this?" said the boy as he picked up<br/>the scroll.<p>"It's a technique used for demolition. I've never been able to get<br/>it right. Maybe you'll have better luck with it," said the voice<br/>calmly.<p>Ryoga frowned and attempted to peer through the crack near the<br/>top. A small man in a hardhat stood outside the cave. "I work at a<br/>construction site nearby. I'm afraid I don't have any tools with me,<br/>or I'd help you out."<p>"Thanks," muttered Ryoga halfheartedly.<p>"Sorry. I'd call for help, but by the time anyone else got here,<br/>you'll have dug yourself out of there. The rockslide wasn't that bad,"<br/>said the man with a shrug as he wandered away.<p>"What is this technique?" grumbled Ryoga as he opened the scroll.<br/>His eyes went wide as he began to read.<p>++++++++++++<p>"What the heck?" said Ranma as he turned to see a familiar looking<br/>ball of energy bouncing towards him.<p>"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAA! What a haul!"<p>"Granpa?"<p>Happosai skidded to a halt and stared up at the boy for a moment.<br/>"Well, if it isn't li'l Ranma!"<p>"Still up to the same old tricks are we?" said the boy with a<br/>small chuckle.<p>"Of course," said the old man cheerfully. "I've heard about what<br/>happened to you. A real shame."<p>"I'm getting better, but it's time consuming," said Ranma with a<br/>slightly tired sounding sigh.<p>"I imagine so. I'll come by and see you tomorrow. I may be able to<br/>help you out a bit," said the old man as he sat down on the pavement<br/>and lit his pipe.<p>"Pardon?" muttered Ranma in shock.<p>"Well, you are going to be my heir after all. You promised me<br/>you'd let me train you after that whole thing was over," said the old<br/>man as he looked up at the boy.<p>"I...suppose I did," muttered Ranma as he looked down at the old<br/>man for a moment. "Real training though, not that crap you pulled on<br/>Soun and my father."<p>"Of course, those two idiots still don't realize I never took them<br/>seriously," said Happosai with a small chuckle.<p>Ranma nodded and leaned against a nearby wall. "According to the<br/>doctors, I'll never be like I was though."<p>"Rubbish," snorted Happosai. "Doctors aren't worth spit. I'll have<br/>you back to normal in no time flat."<p>"I'm sure," commented Ranma wryly.<p>"Don't count this old man out yet, I've got a trick or two up my<br/>sleeve still," said Happosai cheerfully as he hopped back to his feet.<p>"You'll forgive me if I don't get too excited," deadpanned Ranma.<br/>"I'd love to do a little training with you though. I don't think I've<br/>ever seen my mother happier than the day she caught us raiding her<br/>panty drawer."<p>"Nodoka, is a good woman," agreed Happosai.<p>"Well, I'll see you later then, I've got to get back. Mom's having<br/>Genryu and his wife over tonight. You know how these things can be."<p>"How is that cute little sister of yours anyway?" said Happosai.<p>"Ukyo?" muttered Ranma as he feigned ignorance.<p>"No boy! The hot one, that cute little redhead!" quipped Happy.<p>"Oh, well you should know. She's coming down the street with her<br/>wife, and about fifty other women armed with brooms and mops."<p>Happosai looked over his shoulder for a moment. "Oops, gotta run<br/>boy!" He lifted his bag back over his shoulder and jumped up onto the<br/>wall.<p>"Yup," agreed Ranma as he watched the old man rush off. "I suppose<br/>I should tell Mom that Genryu and Ukyo are gonna be a little late."<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: Guess who's coming to dinner? And I don't mean Ukyo and<br/>Genryu.<p>
