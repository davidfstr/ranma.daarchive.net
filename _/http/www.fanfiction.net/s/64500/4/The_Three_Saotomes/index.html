</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 4<p>Ranma's curse.<p>Akane frowned as she slowly ate her lunch. Every part of her body was sore and she growled angrily as another bunch of flowers was added to the growing pile beside her.<p>"Uh hi. I'm Sairo..." started the boy who handed them to her.<p>"Go away," she growled.<p>The boy ignored her and continued, he scratched the back of his head and laughed nervously. "I was wondering if you were free Saturday night, maybe we could go out or something..."<p>"No," snapped the girl angrily as she glared at him.<p>"I can see you're not feeling well. I'll come back later," said the boy with a shrug. He wandered off and Akane looked around and saw several other boys lying in wait. Each of them was waiting for just the right moment to ask her out. Some of them lingered around the water fountains, while others merely waited in secluded areas of the schoolyard. Every area that was even remotely considered romantic was packed with male students.<p>"Well, at least it's gotten better," offered Yuka with a small uncertain smile.<p>"How so?" snorted Akane distastefully.<p>"Come on Akane, at least you don't have to beat them all up every day anymore," offered Sayuri.<p>"Hi!" yet another boy popped his head around the corner with the same stupid grin as all of the others.<p>"I'm starting to think I might enjoy it," said the girl with another angry look covering her face. Her eye twitched as the male stood in front of her with a box of candy. Somehow she didn't think she was going to make it past lunch period.<p>A few moments later she snapped her chopsticks in half as a familiar voice roared across the schoolyard.<p>"So! You all believe this falsehood that you defeated Akane Tendo! Curs! It was my mighty intellect that has slain the mighty warrior woman! I claim the sole right to her hand! Akane Tendo, weep with joy at last, for I, the mighty Blue Thunder of Furinkan High shall allow you to date with me at last!"<p>"Hey! You can't talk to us like that!" screamed one of a growing group of boys that crowded around the Kendoist.<p>"Silence dog! You dare oppose the mighty Tatewaki Kuno?"<p>"Like Ranma said, he can't beat all of us!" cried one of the boys from inside the crowd. More boys joined the mob with each moment. "We can take him if we do it all at once!" agreed another boy.<p>Akane almost jumped out of her skin when another unwelcome voice disrupted her day.<p>"Well, this is certainly going to be interesting." Ranma stood over her with his arms crossed over his chest as he watched the scene in amusement from next to her.<p>"What do you mean?" said Yuka in confusion.<p>"Those fools actually think they can win against him," said the boy with a small wink at her.<p>Akane almost choked.<p>"I heard that you told them they could," said Sayuri with a frown appearing on her face.<p>"I would never say that. I simply asked them if they thought they could. After all, if it worked on Akane, why wouldn't it work on him?" His eyes went back to the mob and he smiled.<p>"That's right! Kuno's going to get what he deserves!" snapped Akane angrily.<p>"The reason it wouldn't work on Kuno is simple; because he's better than you are."<p>All three girls looked at him in disbelief.<p>Akane jumped to her feet and started to open her mouth to protest when he simply put his hand over her mouth before she could react.<p>"Just watch, if it isn't true I'll be proven wrong in a minute won't I?" he smiled darkly and once again returned his attention to the growing tension in the center of the yard.<p>"Get him!" screamed one of the mob. The boys swarmed like ants towards the Kendoist. Kuno smiled and chuckled to himself as he spread his feet apart and readied himself. "Fools."<p>Screams of pain and the thud of wood hitting flesh was all that could be heard for almost a full minute. When it was all over Kuno stood alone in the center of the fallen mob.<p>"Thus I have shown you the error of your ways, for it is the way of the samurai to lead the sheep towards the path or righteousness. He posed proudly and smirked to himself. "For only an intellect as keen as my own could possibly tame the tigress known as Akane Tendo."<p>"Thanks I'll take that as a compliment."<p>The boy whirled around and snorted in disgust at the figure that was slowly walking towards him. Behind Ranma the oak that towered over the grounds shook suddenly as Akane took out her momentary shock and rage out on the tree.<p>"It was my plan that defeated Akane Tendo after all," he stood relaxed and stared the boy down hard.<p>"How can you claim such a victory knave? It was I who issued the challenge against her!"<p>"You traitor!" muttered one of the still conscious boys from the ground. "You said we could beat him!"<p>Ranma looked at him and raised his eyebrow slightly. "No, I asked you if you thought you could. After all, Akane beats him every day doesn't she? Obviously it was you who was mistaken." He turned his attention back on the Kendoist and smiled coolly. "The same tactics don't work every time you know. That stunt I showed you earlier probably won't work on Akane again."<p>"I see that Nabiki Tendo was indeed a good match for you Saotome. Tell me, what is your intent here?"<p>"Simple. My plan defeated Akane Tendo, therefore I get to decide on her fate. I say she can date whomever she chooses too. If one of these boys asks her out and she accepts, then you will not interfere."<p>"You dare speak in such a way to a superior class!" snapped the boy as he charged forward swinging the wooden sword over his head.<p>Ranma stepped back and narrowly avoided the strike. He released a quick controlled kick into the boy's gut and Kuno fell over clutching his stomach. "You think you're the only fool here with samurai blood in his veins? Get over it fool. The samurai died out a long time ago, your foolish daydreaming will not bring them back. You're no better than any man here."<p>"S...silence fool," coughed the boy as he struggled to his knees with a look of pain on his face.<p>At the base of the tree where Akane sat with her friends. Genryu appeared with a meat bread roll in his mouth. He raised his eyebrow slightly and snorted. "That Kuno's better than I thought. He took that blow without loosing his lunch. That takes a lot of control."<p>"Eww gross!" cried Yuka.<p>"That's what that kick was designed to do. It's a nerve center in the stomach," said the boy with a shrug.<p>"A kick that makes you throw up?" said Sayuri in disgust.<p>"He would have been better off if he had, he'll have a nasty stomach ache for the rest of the day now. Right Akane?" Genryu turned his head and looked at the girl in question. He paused for a moment and backed away as she pulled her arm out of the tree. It was stuck into the trunk all the way up to her elbow.<p>"RRRAAANNNMMAAAA!"<p>Everyone within ten feet immediately vacated the area, Genryu included.<p>"Pathetic," snorted Ranma as he sidestepped a clumsy strike. Kuno was still attacking despite the burning pain in his belly. The boy was hunched over and swinging almost blindly.<p>Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your point of view. Kuno never saw the blow coming. Ranma jumped into the air in shocked surprise as a park bench slammed into the Kendoist from behind him. Whoever was swinging it was obviously aiming for him. "What the?"<p>"I don't need your help you stupid jerk! Stay out of my life!" screamed Akane as she hefted the seat over her head again and charged forward.<p>"Who said I was doing this for you?" retorted the boy with a grin on his face. "You're nothing but a spoiled little princess anyway."<p>"How dare you! You jerk!" screamed the girl as she swung the bench around like it was a mace.<p>"At least I know I'm a jerk. You just get offended when people tell you how you really act tomboy!" quipped the older boy as he dodged fluidly around her strikes. The maddening smile appeared on his lips yet again.<p>"I'll kill you!" screamed Akane in a rage. She charged forward with the bench held high over her head.<p>Ranma stopped cold. He spun around to face her with a cold hard look on his face. "Bad choice of words." Akane swung down and he simply caught the offending object in his hands snatching it away from her.<p>That didn't stop Akane though, she looked at her empty palms for a moment and made fists before charging forward again. Ranma didn't even bother to dodge. He stood in place and blocked every strike she sent at him without much effort.<p>Finally she thrust forward and charged forward in a punch that carried all of her strength. Ranma did not dodge this one. Her arm passed under his and he grabbed her chest while slipping her leg behind her, with a gentle shove he knocked her to the ground.<p>Akane was dazed for a split second and it was all the boy needed. She jerked her head up and stopped cold as a fist brushed against her throat. "Pervert," she gasped as a small lingering pain formed in her breast where he had grabbed her.<p>"You just died," said the boy simply. He gazed directly into her eyes with an eerie calm and smirked slightly. All he saw staring back at him was complete fear. "You have to learn to control your anger. It's going to get you killed someday. Understand?"<p>Akane nodded numbly not even realizing what she was doing. He stepped back away from her and turned towards the school. She glanced around at paused at what she saw. Everyone was looking at her in silenced awe mixed with fear.<p>"Akane! Are you all right?" cried Yuka as she rushed up to her with Sayuri following closely behind.<p>The girl didn't even look at them. She merely stood up and turned away. "No I'm not." With that said she walked towards her home and left the grounds.<p>Genryu frowned as he walked beside his brother as they moved back towards class. "That was a bit much don't you think?"<p>"No. You know what's coming. I don't need a hot headed girl like that running around trying to prove herself and be a hero."<p>Genryu nodded and looked back over his shoulder. "Right, I guess... We have to get out of here."<p>"You're not kidding. We can't just run off and leave Pop behind though," said Ranma.<p>"Yeah, if he's here we might as well be. Who knows what they might do?"<p>"Probably kill him, I can't believe he's dumb enough to stay in one place this long."<p>"Two words, Cat Fist," snorted Genryu distastefully.<p>Ranma managed a snort of amusement. "Crouch of the Wild Tiger."<p>"I guess that answers that," commented Genryu with a sigh.<p>"Hey, you never had to deal with 'Hells Cradle'," said Ranma with a sour frown.<p>"What's that?" asked the younger boy in confusion.<p>"Pray you never find out," said his brother as he turned into his classroom.<p>"Just wait here!" snapped Genryu in his female form as he walked into the building. There was a slight rain outside and he had been caught in it while walking home.<p>Dr. Onno Tofu blinked in surprise as the girl's voice reached his office. He stood up and looked into the waiting room at the young redhead who stood glancing around.<p>"Hello, can I help you?" He smiled at her as he stepped out.<p>"Uh yeah, I need to borrow some hot water. Do you mind?" asked the girl nervously.<p>"Whatever for?" said the man in confusion.<p>"Never mind," muttered Genryu as she turned towards the door.<p>"I don't mind, just wait here a moment will you?"<p>Genryu nodded her head and looked about nervously. "Why don't you go ahead and change into those spare clothes you have in your bag. You might catch a cold if you're not careful," said the doctor cheerfully as he pointed towards a privacy curtain.<p>"That's ok. They got wet too," said the girl with a nervous laugh. She quickly stuffed the sleeve that was hanging out of her bag back inside and clasped it shut.<p>Nabiki Tendo walked towards her home with a huge frown on her face. It turned out she was right about her new fiancee all along. He was dangerous, and a complete psycho. "At least daddy will kick them out after today." Somehow it wasn't much consolation. "Oh well, at least the rain stopped."<p>She continued on her way and paused as she neared Dr. Tofu's clinic. Something wasn't quite right there. She quickly ducked behind a trashcan as Genryu emerged from the clinic and walked up to a large animal that was just standing in front of the building. She sucked in a quick breath as the beast turned its head giving her a clear view of its profile. "That's a..." The words died in her mouth at what she saw next. "Ranma?"<p>Ranma sat across from Soun Tendo with a shocked look on his face. He simply could not believe the words that were coming from his mouth.<p>"Yes son, I said thank you. My daughters training has been lax, I simply cannot find the ability to properly train Akane in the ways of Anything Goes. I knew of these morning attacks, but simply could not bring myself to stop them."<p>His jaw dropped and almost hit the tabletop as he simply stared at the man in disbelief. "B...but..." He almost didn't notice Nabiki fall face first onto the table. The smug grin she had vanished in an instant.<p>"For showing such 'hard love' to my youngest daughter I am now certain that you will be able to carry on the Anything Goes school in ways I never hoped to dream of. Ranma, my son, you have made me very proud."<p>"Quite so son," agreed Genma from beside his friend.<p>"Are you out of your mind?" said Nabiki coldly as she regained her composure suddenly. "He almost got Akane killed."<p>"Actually he did stop the boys before they beat her too badly," commented Genryu casually from his seat beside his brother.<p>Ranma promptly smacked him on the back of his head while Nabiki just glared at him.<p>"I any case, I am now more confident than ever that you were the right choice," continued Soun with prideful tears forming in his eyes. "I would greatly appreciate it if you helped my daughter continue her training."<p>Ranma growled with an angry glare as he tried to burn holes through the surface of the table. He slowly nodded his head and quickly shifted his gaze away from the two idiot men. "Great, I should have known something like this would happen."<p>Genryu snickered to himself as he heard his brother's mutterings. The older boy stood up and walked away towards the dojo.<p>"Daddy, there is no way in hell I'm going to marry a barn animal!" snapped Nabiki angrily.<p>Everyone at the table turned to look at her in surprise.<p>Akane was in her room brooding, she was sprawled out on her belly on the bed and was hugging her pillow. Today had been the worst day of her entire life. Ranma had made it very clear that she had a long way to go before she could even think about facing him. Besides, he was a complete and total jerk. That's what made it even worse. "At least his little brother isn't so bad." She didn't care much for him either, but at least he pretty much left her alone for the most part. Ranma seemed to take pleasure in tormenting her though. What worried her more was the times she had seen him conversing with his younger brother when they thought they were alone. They seemed nervous and edgy at times, like they were afraid of something. Whatever could scare those two so badly was not something she wanted to meet anytime soon.<p>She sighed and rolled onto her feet moving off the bed. A light rain started outside and she went over to the window to close it. She paused and blinked at what she saw outside. After closing the window she turned around and walked out of her room. "Daddy, why is there a horse in our front yard?"<p>TBC...<p>Next time: Genryu's challenger.<p>C&amp;C to<p>URL: .com/misatira/<p>
