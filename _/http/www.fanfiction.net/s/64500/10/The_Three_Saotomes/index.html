</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part Ten<p>The honor of a murderer.<p>Ranma stood up and glared at the two men as he finished his story. Genma and Soun remained silent for a long moment.<p>"Is this all?" said Soun finally.<p>"What else do you need to know?" said Ranma as he sat down and sipped at his tea.<p>"How do you plan to marry my daughter if you already have a wife?" said Soun with a remarkable calm.<p>"Easy. There are no records of our marriage. It was held in the temple on the farm. We never got around to legalizing it in town. Plus, I seriously doubt if she plans to continue our relationship. She thinks I killed her brother."<p>"You never did explain that," said Soun as he nodded his understanding and put his teacup on the table.<p>"I'm not really certain, she never would explain it to me. It's been, "Ranma prepare to die!" every time I saw her since that day."<p>"He is correct Tendo," agreed Genma with a small nod.<p>"Hmm, I see."<p>Ranma sighed and shifted uncomfortably. "According to her, he told her that I killed her. The way I see it, she found him just before he died and he never got the chance to explain what happened. That's the only thing I can think of. Me and Fei Wu were always good friends, he wouldn't lie about that."<p>"You never attempted to explain things to her?" prodded Soun carefully.<p>"Of course I did. She won't listen, and she's never met Wai Mei Kai. I don't think she believes in curses or magic. I don't recall her ever seeing my curse or Genryu's before either. That might help my case, but I doubt it. If I did it myself I would be vulnerable; Ranma might be able to help. However, I haven't tried that yet. I doubt if it will work anyway, seeing how she's totally obsessed with it."<p>"If your other curse didn't convince her..." said Genma.<p>"You're right," agreed his son with his head hung slightly.<p>"Other curse?" asked Soun.<p>"It isn't anything to worry about. Especially since I'm leaving tomorrow."<p>"Now hold on son! We never said anything about that yet!" cried Genma as he stood up and slammed his hands onto the table.<p>"We can come back and work this out after we get rid of that demon pop! I won't drag Soun or his family into this. Not even for your precious honor!" snapped Ranma in retort.<p>"Both of you calm down. It's not so bad after all. You have not seen this thing for some time correct?"<p>Both Saotomes looked at him and sat down again.<p>"No, we have not," said Genma as he smirked at his son.<p>"Damn you!" snarled Ranma as he sat down. "I'm leaving with or without you! Genryu is coming with me as well!"<p>"Kidnapping is a crime son," warned Genma.<p>"So what? What are they going to do? Kill me?" replied the boy angrily. "You can stay here and die if you want! I'm leaving."<p>"Come on boy, I know you better than that. You won't leave me behind, if only because you know that Soun and his family will be in danger if you do leave me here. We have not seen that demon in months, he will not find us here."<p>"So we just leave him? Let him kill hundreds if not thousands of innocent lives in China while he tries to find us?"<p>"Let the Chinese Government deal with it Son. They will find a way to get rid of him, if they already haven't that is," said Genma calmly.<p>"Damn you old man. I will find a way to destroy that demon yet."<p>"Fine. Look for a way here then. Everybody needs a hobby. We aren't going anywhere Son," said Genma with a finality in his tone.<p>Ranma whirled around and glared at him. "I should kill you. That would eliminate any danger to the Tendos, and allow me and Genryu to leave."<p>Soun jumped up in alarm, but Genma grabbed his arm and forced him back down again. "You won't."<p>Ranma walked away and went up the stairs to his room.<p>"Saotome," started Soun with a worried tone.<p>"My son is many things, but he is an honorable man. He is not a killer Tendo."<p>"I see, but still."<p>"Soun my friend, don't worry. Ranma does respect me despite outward appearances, and we cannot run any longer. It is time we faced our destiny, the demon is long gone, and Ranma must rid himself of his past. He must defeat that woman if he is ever to live a peaceful life."<p>-<p>Inside the kitchen Kasumi Tendo stood against the wall with her hand over her mouth. Her face was a mask of shocked horror and tears streamed down her face. She wasn't sure quite what she was feeling at the moment, it could be pity, fear, or simply sympathy towards the boy. There was also the tiny twinge of anger towards Genma. The man didn't seem to realize how heartless he had been. "Oh! Ranma. I'm sorry," she whispered silently.<p>She glanced outside of the kitchen and saw him walk up the stairs slowly. He turned his eyes and looked at her for a moment. A small smile crept onto his face as he did. It wasn't malicious; he looked tired more than anything else. He continued on his way and went up to his room without a word.<p>-<p>Nabiki looked at her sister and frowned. They were walking home in the rain, Kuno had parted with them a short time ago and they had nothing more to say to one another since then. Neither one of them had spoken since they left the clinic apart from a polite goodbye to Tatewaki.<p>Finally when the dojo was in sight, Nabiki spoke. "What are we going to do?"<p>"Nothing, there's nothing we can do right now," said Akane.<p>"I'm not sure I can stand it, being in the same room as that monster."<p>They stood watching the home silently for a moment in the rain. Both of them seemed reluctant to take another step closer to the home.<p>"So, did you learn anything?" said a familiar voice from behind them.<p>Both girls jumped in shock and turned to see Genryu in her female form. Her face was dead serious.<p>"We learned enough," said Nabiki carefully.<p>"I'd like to hear it. I've never heard her version of the story before. She wouldn't have told it if I had gone with you."<p>The girls looked at her in surprise and started to slowly move down the street towards the home with her. Nabiki didn't like it. Genryu was an unknown factor. He might have been in on the murder with her brother. Fei Wu had only mentioned Ranma's name; it was possible that Genma and his younger son were unaware. Somehow she doubted that. They didn't appear to have the kind of money a golden suit of armor would have gotten them either though. That meant that Ranma could have kept it to himself as well. It did seem unlikely that he could hide an entire set of armor on himself without them knowing though. "That could mean he unloaded it in China," said Nabiki out loud.<p>"Huh? D'ya say something?" said Genryu as he looked at her from the top of the fence.<p>"It's nothing, just thinking out loud."<p>"Oh."<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma sat brooding in his room alone later that night. He stared out the window into nothing and sighed. Genryu appeared in the doorway and sat down on the floor nearby.<p>"Pop said he won't leave."<p>Genryu nodded at this. "Maybe he's right? The Chinese might have already taken care of it?"<p>"No. I guarantee you they haven't," said Ranma without looking back. His face was almost wistful.<p>"How do you know?"<p>"Oh. Just a feeling really." The boy got a sort of sad smile on his face for a moment. "You know, I still kind of miss her sometimes."<p>"She was real nice, before," agreed Genryu.<p>"All that anger, it's a shame really..." Both of them fell silent after that for a long time.<p>"The girls went and talked to her today at the clinic. I'm not sure what she told them."<p>Ranma looked back at him for a moment and nodded. "You'll try and find out? I'd like to hear her side of things for once. Aside from, "Ranma, prepare to die!" or, "You killed my brother! Die!""<p>Genryu nodded and stood up. "Haven't seen Ryoga in a while either."<p>"He'll be around. I doubt that he's given up just yet."<p>"That could be fun, I don't think he really wants me dead."<p>"Better be sure little brother," commented Ranma as he returned his gaze outside again. A light rain had started.<p>Genryu nodded and walked towards the door. He paused and turned back for a moment again. "Will you be coming to school tomorrow?"<p>"I don't think I have a choice. Pop isn't leaving, that means we have to stay. I hate that there's nothing we can do short of killing him. You know we wouldn't be able to hold him if he really wanted to get away."<p>"That idiot, he's going to get us all killed," growled Genryu as he walked out of the room.<p>"You got that right little brother," commented Ranma to himself.<p>++++++++<p>Nearby, in a small bar just outside of Nerima...<p>A figure dressed in a long cloak stood in the doorway to the small hole in the wall bar. His face was hidden from view by the large hood that draped down over his eyes. He passed several rough looking patrons and smirked as he got the attention of the bartender.<p>"I'm looking for this man."<p>The old balding man behind the bar was dressed in a leather vest and snorted as he looked at the photo of Ranma Saotome. "What's his name?"<p>"I don't know," replied the man.<p>"Can't help you then. I don't recognize him."<p>"Thanks for your time," said the figure as he turned away. A long curvy leg blocked his path and he looked up to see an attractive woman in her late twenties smiling at him seductively.<p>"Hello handsome, come around here much?"<p>"I'm just passing through," he replied as he attempted to move around her.<p>"Want something to remember this place by? It don't cost much," she leaned in and tried to get a look at his features while showing off her assets.<p>"No thanks, I have no need of your kind," replied the boy rudely as he pushed the leg out of his way and walked towards the door.<p>Several large men walked in front of him. One of them shoved him in the chest causing him to take a step back.<p>"You can't talk to our lady friend that way pal. I'm afraid we're gonna have to teach you some manners." Several of his companions chuckled in amusement at this and spread out to surround him.<p>"Move," said the stranger firmly.<p>"I don't think you understand friend," said one of the smaller men as he pushed forward and put his finger in the stranger's chest.<p>The cloaked man jumped back suddenly and reached behind his back. A flash of silver shone in the dark smoky room for a moment as a light whirring sound hummed through the air. Everyone in the bar fell silent suddenly and the man straightened himself up before walking past his would be attackers and out the door. He paused just outside the window and raised his hand in the air just as the window blew open. A four-foot metal boomerang landed in his palm lightly and he continued on his way without stopping.<p>Inside the bar, the bartender stood watching in awe as the men fell to the ground. They all had large bruises visible on their heads, but not one of them had been cut, despite the fact that several tables and bottles fell in half along the path the weapon had traveled. No one besides those men had even been touched. "That's impressive."<p>"I'll say," commented the whore as she swallowed slightly.<p>"I wonder who he was?" said the bartender as he sighed and started to clean out the bottom half of the glass that was still in his hand. The top had shattered on the floor moments before.<p>Outside, the man looked at the photo in his hand and frowned. "I know I'm getting close. Soon, revenge will be mine!"<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma woke up and coughed, he shook his mane and glared at the panda and the girl standing next to him.<p>"Come on son! You're well enough to train again!" said the animal's sign.<p>The black stallion snorted in disgust and glared at his two would be attackers.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Kasumi smiled as two figures landed in the koi pond just outside from the second floor. She walked outside and smiled at the pair sitting in the water. Hoof prints were visible on both of them. "Oh my! It looks like Ranma might want something different for breakfast." She pulled out a bale of hay and placed it next to the table with the bamboo chutes she had already prepared.<p>+++++++++++<p>Nabiki scowled as her fiancee walked next to her on the way to school a short time later. "You got hair all over the bathroom."<p>"Blame the cross dresser and his father," snorted the boy in reply. "It's too hard to make hot water without hands in the kitchen."<p>Genryu landed on his older brother's head and snorted as Ranma fell to the ground. "Don't forget that you're weaker than I am at the moment bro."<p>"And when I get better I'll get you back for that," replied Ranma lazily.<p>Akane pulled her sister's arm and led her back behind the pair a fair distance away. The last thing she wanted was for Nabiki to make him angry. He seemed relatively calm at the moment, but that could change fast.<p>They approached the school gates and entered the grounds of Furinkan High. Within seconds a battle cry erupted from behind the large oak tree.<p>"Ranma Saotome! Prepare to die!"<p>The sound of metal sliding against a wooden hilt seemed to fill all of Ranma's senses and he ducked instinctively. Kuno charged forward with his Katana held over his head. Ranma lashed out with both legs from the ground, one kicked the boy in his gut, while the other swept him off of his feet. Kuno hit the ground hard.<p>Ranma was back on his feet in an instant and he charged forward with a hard look on his face. He slammed his fist into Kuno's chest and stopped the boy's sword swing by bracing his elbow against his attacker's forearm. Before anyone could even blink Kuno was disarmed, and Ranma held the blade to the boy's throat.<p>"No!" screamed Akane as she moved forward to help the boy. Kuno was pinned with his back against the tree.<p>Ranma glared him directly in the eyes and stepped back with the blade in his hands. "If you ever try that again, I will kill you." In one swift motion he broke the blade in half across his knee.<p>Kuno stood unflinching in his position and glared at Ranma angrily. He knelt down beside the remains of his blade and carefully picked them up in his hands. "The Kuno family blade. For this dishonor, there can be no forgiveness."<p>"Yet again, you speak of honor. Attacking an unarmed opponent with a sword? Where is the honor in that? Be glad it was the sword and not your neck. Your honor means nothing to you unless it's convenient. You are not a samurai, nor will you ever be one." Ranma turned away and walked towards the school.<p>Genryu stood with Akane and Nabiki with a look of shock on all of their faces. What Ranma had just done was down right nasty, even for him. Kuno would never stop now.<p>"How could you do such a thing bro?" said Genryu.<p>Both girls looked at him in confusion for a moment. Surely the boy knew how bad his brother was. Starting a blood feud with the Kunos was not something to be taken lightly either.<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma stood in the bathroom a short time later and splashed warm water on his face. He knew what he had just done. What made it worse was that he hadn't really thought about the consequences until it was too late. Now, instead of getting Kuno off his back, he had probably made things a hundred times worse.<p>"Damn it!" He punched at his reflection and shattered the glass. He slumped down to his knees and let his hand hang in the basin as the blood flowed freely from his knuckles. "Why does everything have to go so damn wrong?" He stared at his reflection and noticed the tears streaming down his face. With a final fit of rage overcoming him he lifted his head up and screamed. The light bulbs in the bathroom exploded in a shower of sparks and energy crackled across the metal surfaces within the room. All over the school the lights flickered on and off for a moment, and then it all stopped.<p>He stood up with an angry look in his eyes and stared at his reflection in the shattered glass. "I'm growing to hate you Ranma Saotome, but we have unfinished business to take care of first. Nothing will stop me from finishing it."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Kasumi was sweeping the walkway when the gates of the dojo opened. Ranma walked in with his head hung low and his hand bandaged in a white cloth that he had torn from his undershirt. It was dripping blood onto the ground as he walked and he staggered by her with a tired look on his face.<p>"Oh my! Ranma what's wrong?" she rushed to his side and took his injured arm gently.<p>"Nothing much. I just started a feud with the Kuno family, and then totally lost it in school a little while ago. How are things here?" He gave her a fake smile and she looked at him uncomfortably. His features moved back to a deep depression as he allowed himself to be led inside.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Son, what happened?" said Genma as he noticed his son's condition.<p>Ranma looked up at him and smirked. "Don't worry Pop, it was all my fault this time." He passed by silently and sat down. Kasumi appeared by his side a moment later with a first aid kit. She started to bandage his arm and sat quietly while the two men prodded him for information.<p>Ranma merely sat quietly and hung his head while ignoring them. After Kasumi finished bandaging his hand he stood up and walked up the stairs. He paused at the top and turned his head slightly. "We'll be receiving a letter of challenge soon. I'll take care of it." He said nothing more and closed the bedroom door behind him as he entered.<p>"Kasumi, what is going on?" said Soun.<p>"I'm not sure father. He said something about a feud with the Kunos though."<p>"Kami! What has the boy done now?" lamented Genma.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"That was quite a display," commented Nabiki as she sat with Akane during lunch. Both girls had excused themselves from their normal circle of friends and were alone in a quiet corner of the schoolyard.<p>"What was he thinking?" snapped Akane angrily.<p>Genryu jumped down beside them and both of them gave him angry looks. He ignored them and sat down. "Something is wrong with my brother."<p>"No kidding. Murder, theft, perhaps more?" commented Nabiki.<p>"Ranma has never killed anyone. I know, I was there."<p>This caught both girls by surprise; they looked at each other and then back at Genryu again.<p>"If what you say is true, why is that Chinese girl so hot on killing him?"<p>"I'm not really sure, she's never attacked me or Pop because of it. We were both there. I think it has something to do with his relationship with her. They were in love. She thinks he betrayed her or somethin."<p>"Then you know what happened?" said Akane as she leaned towards him.<p>"We swore not to talk about it. The fewer people who know the better."<p>"I think I have the right to know if I'm marrying a psychopath!" retorted Nabiki angrily.<p>"Then ask him about it. He'll probably tell you if you do."<p>Akane and Nabiki fell silent after that.<p>"Look, my brother has been through a lot. This whole situation has him trapped. I don't like it much myself. I've never, ever seen him this stressed out. I don't think he can take it much longer."<p>"Xianghua told us she loved him, but he betrayed her," said Akane.<p>"Is that all?"<p>"She said he stole this armor and ran away with it. Then murdered her brother. She found him and he told her that it was him that did it," finished Nabiki.<p>"Oh man," Genryu didn't look happy with the story. "Look, we didn't steal that armor. Pop tried to, but we stopped him, sort of."<p>"How do you 'sort of' stop someone from stealing?" said Nabiki with her eyebrow raised slightly.<p>"That armor didn't need anyone to steal it. Look. Just trust me on this. If you ask Ranma he'll tell you the whole story. I promise he won't hurt you." Genryu turned away and walked off.<p>"What do you think?" Nabiki turned towards her sister.<p>"I think I trust Genryu, but not Ranma," said the girl with a small sigh. "That display this morning didn't help matters any."<p>"It's almost as if he's intentionally making things worse for himself around here. That may be his plan to get out of this engagement thing. If he makes things too uncomfortable for his family, and ours..." Nabiki looked thoughtful for a moment.<p>"Do you think Xianghua is in on this?" Akane looked surprised at the thought of it.<p>"No. I think she's the real thing. You saw what they did to each other."<p>"So, now what?" Akane looked more confused than ever.<p>"We wait. See how things play out for a while." Both sisters nodded in agreement at this and finished their lunch in silence.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>In Southern China...<p>Villagers screamed as they ran from the burning remains of their village. Destruction was all that could be seen within the village as small explosions ripped through the building. A single figure moved in the opposite direction from the crowds. Her face was stern and she had a long bundle across her back. Her long violet hair flowed down the middle of her back and her gaze was almost pure ice.<p>In the center of the village a horrible being stood with his katana drawn. Its ivory handle was a carved dragon head with gold woven into the pattern. Two ruby eyes seemed to shine through the black fire as the golden armor stood on the remains of a building. Fire burned all around it, but the light from the flames seemed to be sucked into the golden surface of the armor.<p>"How long must I search? I will devour the souls of those mortals who would keep me away! I will have their flesh as my own yet!" The voice was deep and inhuman.<p>"Not today demon!" snarled Shampoo as she appeared in front of it. She slowly untied the wrapped bundle revealing a long ornate spear. It was polished silver and the handle was etched with the pattern of dragon scales.<p>"So, we meet again," said Wai Mei Kai as it stalked towards her slowly.<p>"This time, I will destroy you!" snapped the amazon girl as she moved into a ready position.<p>"You are not strong enough for that child."<p>"Die!" Shampoo charged forward. The spear seemed to come alive with a white fire as she thrust forward at the thing. It blocked with its sword and parried. The two moved in and out of the debris slashing at one another as they passed. The fight lasted for several minutes; neither had gained a significant advantage. Their respective aura of flames prevented any real damage from being made.<p>Shampoo stood leaning against her spear in exhaustion as the thing turned away from the village. It had not appeared to grow weary from the battle at all. In the end it simply wore her down and ignored her presence before moving off into the wilderness again. She cursed and hung her head. "I still don't have enough power. I must find this boy before he does. I fear I may not be strong enough to save him, even with this." She carefully wrapped up the spear her great grandmother had given her before she left the village. The villagers had slowly begun to return to the village after the fight had ended. She sat down against a pile of stones that had once been a wall and rested.<p>"You are the one known as the Huntress of Demons?" An elderly man moved up to her cautiously.<p>"What of it?" she said roughly. Males in her village would never be so forward with her.<p>"I am the elder of this village. I wish to thank you for driving that devil away."<p>"Save your breath old man. I've got to be going." She stood up and started off after the demon again. She had an almost legendary reputation now, the slayer of demons. The truth was, she had fought no more than three. Two of them had been flukes, and the third was the demon she had been hunting all along. She always seemed to drive it off, but had never even so much as scratched it. Her skill was improving, but it was not enough just yet. The villages seemed to think that she had killed hundreds of the monsters, in fact she had no more than thirteen battles with Wai Mei Kai, all of which ended in failure.<p>She sighed as the smoking remains of the village disappeared into the horizon. She was thankful for one thing though; neither of them seemed to know where the three men it was after were. So she was still only a few steps behind it.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: A new challenger, but will Ranma be in any condition to face him?<p>C&amp;C to<p>
