</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 29<p>Guess who's coming to dinner?<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Ranma sat in the dining room of his home and smiled as he sipped at a cup of tea. It was nice and quiet, a type of moment he rarely had the time to enjoy in his life. The sky was awash with the orange and pink tones of a sunset. The wind blew across the yard, sending a mass of sakura petals floating through the air.<p>"It's beautiful," he commented to himself as he stared outside. Memories of his training journey floated into his head. It wasn't all bad; there were moments and places that stuck in his mind. Even Genma couldn't be an ass all the time.<p>"What was that?" asked his mother as she entered the room rubbing her hands on a dishtowel.<p>"Nothing, just remembering old times," he said with a somewhat wistful sigh. "There's a lot I'd like to forget, but things I'll always want to remember too."<p>The woman nodded at this and smiled gently. "I see."<p>Ranma watched her for a moment and stood up to help set the table, it wasn't until after he'd finished that he'd realized something. "Aren't there an awful lot of places set?" He looked up at her and smirked. "You're up to something."<p>"I am not up to something," she said with a slight irritation showing in her voice. She sighed and sat down. "I invited your father over tonight."<p>The boy stared at her for a moment and didn't say anything. His face was unreadable. Finally after an awkward silence, he spoke up. "That's a surprise."<p>"He is my husband, and I cannot keep him away from his son forever," she said as she shook her head.<p>"I know, I wish you had said something though. I'd be better prepared to deal with this if you had."<p>"I know you don't like him..." said the woman as she turned away.<p>"Of course I don't, he's an idiot. He's still my father though, I'll never respect him, but I do care a little."<p>Nodoka stared at him for a long time. Finally she released a small giggle that she had been holding in and shook her head. "I am pleased to hear that...somewhat."<p>"Anything else I should know about?" said Ranma as he nodded at the other places and grinned.<p>"He's bringing the Tendo family with him," she said calmly.<p>Ranma shrugged. "Great. They're over here all the time anyway. Well, Kasumi and Akane that is."<p>"I thought you might be a little upset, so I thought it was best not to say anything."<p>"Me? Upset? Hardly. I suppose I should be ready for both of the idiots though. As far as their concerned, I'm available now."<p>"Aren't you?" pried his mother as she stood up and suddenly looked very formal. Even her tone changed.<p>"Don't you start this now. I've got a lot to work out before I can even think about that. Maybe it will take a while, maybe not." Ranma actually looked somewhat amused.<p>"I worry about you," said his mother as she sighed.<p>"You should," he said quietly as he turned away and hobbled out onto the porch, leaning very slightly on his cane still.<p>It didn't take very long before a knock came at the door. He paused his silent reflection as the last rays of light fell behind the horizon, giving way to the stars. With a small sigh he smiled and turned into the home. As he expected, Ukyo and Genryu were standing there, arm in arm, watching him.<p>"Did you catch him?" asked Ranma with a twinkle of amusement in his eyes.<p>"Huh?" muttered Ukyo.<p>"Did you catch Grandpa? You were chasing him earlier," said Ranma as he walked into the home and looked at them.<p>"No, the little jerk," growled Genryu irritably.<p>"That's too bad I suppose," said the older boy as he shrugged.<p>"You know that little troll?" said Ukyo as she stared at her husband.<p>"He's an old friend of the family. I use the term friend loosely of course, but he and I have always gotten along well," said Ranma. "I guess it's because I don't have anything to grope. Not that he'd be interested in anyway."<p>"Why am I not surprised?" snapped Ukyo as she glared at him.<p>"Hey, I didn't do anything to you, it was him. Leave me out of it," replied the older boy as he pat his brother on the back. He turned his head and looked down at the boy. "Glad you could make it. Seems we've got more people coming than I expected."<p>"Huh?" said the boy in confusion.<p>"Mom invited everyone," said Ranma cheerfully. "Come on, you can help carry the food. Mom won't let me touch anything that weighs more than ten pounds, it's irritating."<p>"You shouldn't be straining yourself!" said the woman as she entered the home.<p>"Hello...mother," said Ukyo with a slightly nervous bow.<p>"Come along dear, you can help me in the kitchen," said the woman as she smiled at her.<p>"I hope she's not this friendly with Akane," commented Ranma.<p>"Gah! Don't say things like that!" cried Genryu nervously.<p>"Come on squirt, we can let the women bond on their own," said Ranma as he started walking back to the porch.<p>No more than five minutes later, both brothers turned their heads in unison as another knock came at the door. "Showtime," commented Ranma as he strolled back in to get the door.<p>Genryu moved in front of him and smirked. "Slowpoke." He opened the door to see Soun and Genma standing there with all three Tendo sisters.<p>"Hello boy," said Genma calmly.<p>"Hey, how's it goin?" quipped Ranma cheerfully.<p>Soun was surprisingly friendly. "Hello Ranma. It is nice to see you again."<p>"Same here I guess," replied the boy as he nodded in acknowledgement.<p>"Hello," groused Akane as she passed by him and gave him a slightly frustrated stare. It was obvious she hadn't known about this little meeting.<p>"I wonder what type of idiocy I'll have to deal with tonight?" thought Ranma as he looked the two men up and down as they walked past him into the house.<p>Kasumi and Nabiki walked in after them. The older girl smiled at him cheerfully and the younger one ignored him completely.<p>"Hello Ranma," said Kasumi as she bowed politely after entering.<p>"How ya been?" he replied cheerfully.<p>"Dinner is almost ready," said Nodoka as she turned from greeting the two men. Ukyo was putting some of the food out already and Nodoka turned to get the rest of it from the kitchen.      "Well, shall we eat and get this unpleasant experience out of the way?" asked Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Right," grumbled Nabiki irritably.<p>They sat down around the table and Genma snorted gruffly at his son. He was eyeing the cane irritably and turned his head away.<p>"S'matter Pop?" said the boy with a smirk forming on his face. He tapped the cane against the table and stared right at him. "This bother you?"<p>"It's disgraceful," snorted the man irritably.<p>"Good thing I didn't marry one of the Tendo girls then huh?" replied Ranma cheerfully. "The school certainly wouldn't benefit from an invalid like me."<p>The man sputtered in undisguised shock at that. "Now look boy...you're not attached at the moment. There's no need to..."<p>"I'm a married man," replied Ranma calmly as he picked up his drink and took a sip.<p>"Funny, your wife doesn't seem to think so," countered the man.<p>"Saotome," grumbled Soun.<p>"That one was free old man," growled Ranma under his breath.<p>Kasumi stared at him blankly for a moment and didn't say anything. The rest of the table was uncomfortably silent. It was mercifully broken as Ukyo and Nodoka emerged from the kitchen with the rest of the meal.<p>"Shall we eat?" asked Ranma.<p>"Yes," said Nodoka cheerfully. She didn't seem to notice the tension.<p>"So, how is married life treating you Genryu?" asked Nodoka as she turned to look at her youngest.<p>The boy froze in place and stared at her. He blushed badly and started to stammer. "Uh...fine I...guess..."<p>Ukyo turned red as well. "We're still...adjusting."<p>"Well, it's nice to hear that you both are," said Nodoka cheerfully.<p>This caused the pair to blush even worse.<p>Ranma decided to save them and smirked. "So, think you'll do any of this 'adjusting' tonight?"<p>"Huh?" said Genryu in confusion.<p>Ukyo was far to embarrassed to explain it, but narrowed her eyes at her older brother. Nabiki tried her best not to chuckle, but did anyway at the pair's reaction.<p>"I wonder how long I've got till I'm an Uncle Ranma?"<p>Genma nodded. "Hmmm, the boy is right."<p>"What! We aren't, I mean, we..." stammered Genryu as he started shaking like a frightened rabbit.<p>"Ranma! You shouldn't embarrass your brother like that!" chided Nodoka as she frowned at him.<p>"Sorry, you were doing such a good job of it, I shouldn't have butted in, you're absolutely right," agreed the older boy. It was what he had been hoping for.<p>Akane was oddly amused by this and shook her head.<p>"I understand my Akane has been taking lessons here?" said Soun as he looked at Ranma with a carefully practiced glare.<p>"Yeah, she's dead set on beating me. She's surprisingly stubborn," agreed Ranma.<p>"Hey! I can take you any time you invalid!" snapped Akane.<p>Nodoka's head whipped around to glare at the girl in shocked anger.      Ranma merely chuckled and quietly put his hand on his mother's fingers. She glanced at him and he shook his head.<p>She relaxed slightly and he pulled his hand away. "Maybe we'll see about that tomorrow."<p>"You're going to spar with me?" muttered the girl as she stared at him.<p>"Maybe," he responded. "It all depends on if I think you're ready for that or not."<p>"I am ready!" she snapped.<p>"Boy, what are you talking about?" snapped Genma.<p>"You're confusing injured with helpless, that's what," replied the boy calmly. "I'm not what I used to be, but I'm also not going to break, or let some hotshot kid beat me."<p>Genryu snickered as his father frowned at this. It was obvious he was taunting the man more than Akane. Their mother had forbidden the man from touching his son, training or otherwise, until she gave him express permission.<p>"Stop teasing your father," said Nodoka with the same cheerful calm as she normally had.<p>"All right, it's fun though," said Ranma as he shook his head.<p>"What are you talking about boy?" growled Genma.<p>"Something that's just beyond your grasp," said Ranma as he made a pinching motion with his fingers.<p>"I know when I've been insulted!" snorted the man.<p>"It's about time you figured it out, I've been doing it for years,"  replied Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"That is enough!" snapped Nodoka. "Can't you two sit in the same place for five minutes without bickering?"<p>"Huh? No, not really," said Ranma.<p>"The boy and I are always like this," agreed Genma as he looked at her and blinked.<p>"Yeah, old, fat, and handsome here can't stand that I'm smarter than him," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Thank you boy," said Genma. "Even if it isn't true that you're smarter than me."<p>"Anytime," replied Ranma as he smiled at his father.<p>Genryu hadn't seen them like this in a long time, and could barely contain his smirk.<p>Nodoka was thoroughly confused.<p>The Tendos were somewhat used to Ranma getting the better of Genma verbally and ignored it as they ate.<p>Soun noticed a break in the conversation and coughed. "Ranma, what are your intentions towards my daughter?"<p>Nodoka found another place to focus her glare. Soun seemed about to back off when Ranma intervened.<p>"He has every right to ask mother. I've been seeing a lot of Kasumi lately."<p>The woman looked at him and calmed down.<p>"None, she's a good friend, but I've got a long way to go," replied the boy as he stared at the man seriously. "I'd say the same to any girl as well."<p>"I see," said Soun as he nodded slightly and frowned. The answer was obviously less than satisfactory to him. He didn't press the matter though, mostly because of Nodoka. He wasn't too upset, but mostly because it was a rather open ended statement.<p>Ranma turned his eyes towards Nabiki, and briefly wondered if he had found out through her or Akane. The girls didn't seem to care about the conversation outwardly, but he could tell they were both giving it the utmost attention.<p>The dinner was relatively quiet from then on, with only small talk, and the occasional verbal barb between Genma and his eldest son. After it ended, most of the guests actually stayed and sat around the living room. Ranma went outside on the back porch and paused.<p>Genryu and Ukyo were kissing there in the shadows. It was obviously awkward, but they seemed to be enjoying themselves. He started to turn away and cursed when a surprised yelp stopped his retreat.<p>"Gah! We weren't..." stammered Genryu in shocked embarrassment.<p>Ukyo elbowed him lightly, but frowned at the older boy anyway.<p>"Oops. I thought you were with the rest of them," said the older boy as he turned and smiled at them.<p>"Nuthin happened!" snapped Genryu as he turned his head aside.<p>"Right, I'm sure mother will be so disappointed in you Genryu," said the older boy as he nodded to himself and crossed his arms.<p>"Gah! You aren't going to..." said the boy as he jumped up and down.<p>"No, don't be silly. I'm actually pretty relieved to see you two getting along so well," replied the older boy as he sighed and sat down. "I suggest you wait until later if you want privacy though."<p>"You jerk," grumbled Ukyo.<p>"Yeah, nothin's gonna happen later," muttered Genryu quietly.<p>"Whatever," muttered Ranma as he frowned at them. "I do have a wife you know. I wasn't so different from you two once," he said as he stared into the stars for a moment.<p>Both of the young teens were taken aback by his sudden seriousness. Ukyo realized that he looked much like he did at the tournament, older somehow.<p>It faded as quickly as it came and Ranma shook his cane at him. "You young kids gotta realize that you need to enjoy your youth while you have it! Damn what anyone else thinks!"<p>"Yeah, well you didn't have ta be such an ass earlier," grumbled Genryu.<p>"Who are you kidding? I saved your ass Genryu. You looked like you were about to pass out from embarrassment. At least I was quick, mom would have dragged it on for the whole meal."<p>Genryu paused and stared at the older boy for a moment. "You think so?"<p>"Gods, I know so," muttered Ranma as he rolled his eyes and lay back against the wooden floor. He crossed his arms behind his head and sighed. "Why don't you two take off and spend some time together? Use the restaurant to get out of here if you need too."<p>"What?" cried Genryu as he stared at his brother for a moment.<p>"You pervert," grumbled Ukyo.<p>"I'm serious, you two need a break," said the older boy as he continued to stare up at the stars. "Go on, get lost the both of you."<p>The pair realized he was indeed serious and wandered back into the home. Within a minute they were gone.<p>Ranma sighed and relaxed a bit more as he lay there. His eyes drooped slightly and he smirked as he looked up at the sky. "You can come out now, they're gone."<p>"You didn't have to get rid of them," said Kasumi as she stepped out and sat down next to him.<p>"What are Akane and Nabiki doing?" he asked her without looking at her.<p>"They've started a game of Go, your mother is keeping my father and yours busy. They're talking in the living room."<p>"That's nice, I wonder if she's doing it on purpose?" said the boy as he chuckled.<p>"I can't tell," said Kasumi honestly.<p>"Well, I doubt if they'll even notice that you're gone until she points it out. Are they drunk yet?"<p>"No, but well on the way," said Kasumi with a small sigh.<p>"Let them be old together, it'll make them happy," said Ranma.<p>"I suppose it would," agreed the girl. "How are you doing Ranma?"<p>"This wasn't as painful as I thought it would be. I actually missed having the fat bastard around. It surprised me."<p>"I'd noticed that," said the girl as she turned to look at him.<p>"Hmmm," said the boy as he nodded once.<p>"Ranma...what are we?" she asked suddenly.<p>"Friends," he replied. "I can't give you more than that right now."<p>She nodded at that and rested her chin against the tops of her knees. "That sounds right."<p>"I care Kasumi, I know it doesn't seem that way sometimes. Maybe some day it will grow."<p>"I know," she said with a small giggle. "You have a hard time hiding it from anyone who pays attention."<p>"Really? I thought I was better than that. I guess my little brother rubbed off on me huh?"<p>Kasumi sighed. "I don't think he'd be the man he is if you weren't there for him."<p>"I think he might surprise you," said Ranma wistfully. "I taught him a lot, but he was there for me as much as I was there for him."<p>The girl turned to look at him again and her smile widened a bit. She didn't know what to say, but it was obvious the pair had a bond that even she couldn't understand. Not even with both of her sisters. They had seen and done things together she couldn't imagine, and it showed in their relationship.<p>"Kasumi, what do you think of your future?"<p>"Huh?" she said as she looked at him again.<p>"Where do you think you'll be in ten years?" he clarified with a small frown on his face.<p>"I hope to have my own family by then, a loving husband, a home, even if it's just a tiny apartment."<p>Ranma nodded at this and let out a heavy breath. "I don't have any notion of the future for me. Nothing. I try to think of it, but all I get is nothing. Ten years, twenty years, no matter how far, or how broad I try to think of my life. I get nothing but..."<p>"But?" she asked him quietly.<p>"I can only see myself as I am now. Stronger maybe, never the same as I was though. I wonder what the future will hold for me."<p>"Alone?" she asked him with a small frown of her own.<p>"I'm not sure, maybe," he replied quietly. The idea didn't seem to upset him in the slightest, and that bothered her a little more than she wanted to admit to herself.<p>"Ranma. If you ever ask me, I will say yes," she said to him suddenly.<p>"Kasumi, I'm grateful for that, but it bothers me," he said quietly.<p>The girl blinked in surprise and stared down at him.<p>"Don't wait for me Kasumi. I don't want you to miss your dreams because you were. I might never come."<p>The girl found herself nodding, but she was somewhat numb to the concept.<p>"All my dreams have been broken, shattered to the ground at my feet," he said with a somewhat lyrical quality to his voice. "Heh. Story of my life. I think I've taken it rather well really."<p>"That's...so sad," said the girl.<p>"Yes, despite everything. I believe I'm a better man because of it. Maybe one day I will find another dream?"<p>Kasumi was growing slightly uncomfortable. Ranma was being strangely introspective tonight.<p>"Gah, I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe seeing all of us together again has something to do with it?" He sat upright and shook his head. "Sorry if I've unloaded a bit. I didn't mean anything by it."<p>"No, I'm glad you told me," replied the girl as she smiled at him despite herself. "I still don't understand, but I'm closer to it now."<p>"Kasumi, I sincerely hope that you never do," he replied quietly. "My life...I'm not sorry for it. I'm sorry for things I've done, mistakes I've made...but I can't ever regret who I am. I can't spend my life apologizing for my father either."<p>Kasumi nodded in agreement.<p>"I have a strange feeling though," said the older boy.<p>"What is it?" she asked him.<p>"Over the past few days, I've realized that I'll probably become known as Genryu Saotome's brother, and not the other way around. I've taught him a lot, his father has taught him a lot, but he's about to become a man of his own. I can't protect him the way I used too. He's his own man now."<p>Kasumi blinked at this and looked over at him. "Protect him?"<p>"Yes. In a way, I'm glad this has happened, I might never have realized it if it hadn't. I'd have spent my whole life, trying to save him from himself, from the same mistakes I made. From mistakes he might make."<p>"He worries you?" asked the girl.<p>"He used to, but I've started to see him as the man he's become," said Ranma. "The fact that he's Genma's son worried me more than anything else though."<p>Kasumi found herself giggling at that and looked over at him. When he talked to her this way he was so different from the boy everyone else thought they knew. He was so much more now. Mature, strong, intelligent, the kind of man she'd always envisioned herself with. Outwardly he seemed immature, somewhat careless, and even a little vindictive. It was true to a point, but he seemed so much more to her than that. There was also a sadness there, something that forced him to close up from the world. She knew what caused it now, although she had seen it in him when he'd first arrived. Sometimes she wished she had never found out.<p>It was just like he'd said. His hopes and dreams were crushed, blown away by his life. Everything he had ever known and loved was fading away, or destroyed. Even his brother was moving on, and she could tell that scared him.<p>"Oh Ranma," she muttered as she stood up. "I wish I knew what to say."<p>"You don't have to say anything. I feel better just getting some of it off my chest. I'm sorry if I've burdened you." He shook his head in a very slight self disgust and snorted. "I'll get through, I always do Kasumi."<p>"Yes, I know you will," she said as she looked at him. He was still watching the sky. Seeming to search for a new dream already.<p>Timidly she turned her head and saw the family still sitting around the living room. They weren't paying attention and she grabbed his hand, pulling him aside slightly.<p>"Huh?" he muttered in confusion.<p>"Ranma, I know it might never happen. I don't want to regret though. Will you...just once..."<p>It seemed to take him a moment to figure out what she wanted and he frowned slightly. "Kasumi...I can't..."<p>"I know. I don't want to spend my whole life, wondering what it would have been like."<p>"You love me?" he said as he stepped back.<p>"I think I do, but I'm not in love with you," she said as she turned her eyes to the ground.<p>The boy nodded and sighed. "Just once?"<p>"Yes," she said as she tilted her head and leaned into him.<p>Their lips met, a warmth spread across the girl's body as she clutched at his back and leaned in a little more. He responded by pushing back slightly. Her smell filled his senses, and her touch seemed so soft and gentle.<p>Finally, Kasumi broke off and smiled at him. "Thank you."<p>He nodded and sighed, something tickled his cheek for a moment and he didn't quite recognize the sensation. "What?" He reached up and touched it with the back of his hand and frowned when he realized it was wet. "Am I?" he muttered to himself.<p>Kasumi stepped back away from him with a sort of saddened look in her eyes. He was lost, and she knew it. He always had been. "Oh Ranma..."<p>He looked up at her and found she was smiling at him. "I..."<p>"You do have a dream. Why are you still here?"<p>He stared at her for a moment. "I have a dream?"<p>"I think that you do," she said quietly. "You should go find it. I'll bet you know where it is if you look hard enough."<p>"I wish it was that easy," he said as he turned away from her and started walking into the yard.<p>"Maybe it is?" said the girl softly.<p>If he heard her, he didn't respond and walked through the yard, looking up at the moon through the branches of the cherry tree.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Morning came. A soft light through the curtains of his room roused him from his slumber and he sighed. He hung his legs over the side of his bed and half opened his eyes. "I'm getting too used to sleeping in. I need to do something about that." He shook his head to clear the sleep away and snorted as he looked at the cane that was resting against the night stand.<p>"Stupid western bed, it's too damn comfortable," he grumbled as he looked down at his mattress. He stepped onto the floor and finally realized that a sound had roused him. A low buzzing noise filled the air and he blinked as he searched for the source.<p>Finally he discovered a small alarm clock.<p>"I've got one of these?" he muttered in surprise. It was six in the morning, the light coming through his curtain was nothing more than a dull gray. He glanced through the small slit in the curtains and sighed. "Oh, right, school."<p>Staggering up and grabbing his cane he scratched his head and yawned as he started to get dressed.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Good morning, Ranma," said Nodoka as she smiled at him as he staggered down the stairs.<p>"Morning," he said somewhat sleepily.<p>"Would you like some tea, or coffee?" she said cheerfully.<p>Ranma was growing irritated, he had forgotten that his mother was one of those damned morning people. "No thanks. I should get going. I'm not sure how long it will take me to get to school."<p>"Oh! That's today?" said the woman as she looked suddenly worried.<p>"Yeah, can't put it off forever," he replied with a slight chuckle as he pulled an umbrella from the stand by the door and put it over his shoulder.<p>"There is a school closer to here..." started the woman.<p>"I like Furinkan," he said calmly. "It's not a big deal. I'm not going to break from a little walk every day mother."<p>"Right," said the woman as she pushed aside her arguments. "You should be careful."<p>"Yes, I'll probably be home late today. I'm supposed to meet Grandpa Happosai after school."<p>"Happosai?" said Nodoka in confusion. Her worried frown returned again.<p>"Grandpa Happi and I get along fine Mom. Remember?" said the boy as he laughed at her reaction.<p>Nodoka blushed and turned her head slightly. "Oh, yes. He was always such a nice little man. I don't know what he did to get your father so upset at him."<p>"I wonder about that sometimes too," said the boy as he smirked at her. Briefly he wondered just how much she really knew about the old man. "I'll be back tonight though. Don't worry so much." He twirled his cane around his hand and stepped out the door with his bag hanging from the umbrella on his shoulder.<p>++++++++++++++<p>The school was much as he remembered it. Crowds mulling about in front of the building, no longer to attack Akane, but more to see the stars of the show like some sort of groupies. He snorted in disgust as he stepped through the gates and glanced around.<p>Kuno was standing behind his tree, waiting to pounce on his tigress when she appeared to bask in his glory. Nabiki had arrived and was watching him from the window. Ukyo and Genryu were both moving towards him from near the front doors.<p>Oddly enough, the group was somewhat more concentrated than usual. His mind worked and he realized something was definitely wrong. "Ambush!"<p>He spun around as the sports teams rushed him. He twisted sideways to avoid a baseball bat and took a right hook across his jaw from someone in the boxing club. Growling in anger he hooked his cane around the boy's leg and sent him to the ground, lashing out with his foot and catching the boy in the groin.<p>The battle had just started and a mass of bodies rushed at him from all sides. He stepped back and readied himself, his cane held offensively and his umbrella tossed carelessly to the ground. Without so much as a thought, he quickly took down five of them and cleared himself a path. "Damn! What the hell is going on!" he cried in frustration.<p>People were flying away, and he suddenly realized that the crowd was a lot thinner, and it wasn't because of him. He turned his head and blinked in surprise as he saw Kuno, Ukyo, and Genryu backing him up.<p>"I don't need help," he said to the trio.<p>"You took a hit," said Genryu as he frowned at his brother and backhanded the last of the attackers in his face without looking at him. The hockey mask clad boy fell to the ground out cold.<p>"Only because they took me by surprise this time," snorted the older boy in disgust.<p>"Still," grumbled Ukyo.<p>"I appreciate it," said the boy with a reluctant sigh. "You know I could take them though. Akane could, and she's still not up to par with me, even in this condition."<p>"Akane was getting worse because of it," said Genryu.<p>"I am disgusted with these dogs, attacking an injured man? Have you no honor?" growled Kuno as he stared at one of his kendo club and pointed his bokken down at the knocked out boy's throat.<p>"You I'm surprised to see here," commented Ranma.<p>"I did not do this for you, but rather to discipline my peers," snorted Kuno.<p>"He took out the Kendo club, but no one else," commented Genryu.<p>"I have no love for you Ranma Saotome. I have cast aside our battle, it would hold no glory now."<p>"The fact that I'm Akane Tendo's sensei doesn't hurt either huh?" snorted Ranma as he frowned at the boy.<p>"What?" said Kuno irritably.<p>"Nothing," grumbled Ranma as he turned his head away in disgust.<p>"You claim to be Akane Tendo's sensei?" asked the kendoist.<p>"Yeah, what of it? I'm a higher ranking member of her family's martial arts school," snorted Ranma. "It's my duty, and her father requested it."<p>"I see," said Kuno. "I would be worried by this news, but Akane Tendo holds no false love for you in her heart."<p>"So, you're smart enough to realize that, but not observant enough to realize that she's started to use my branch of the Anything Goes style?" Ranma was somewhat surprised.<p>"Wow, even Kuno noticed that she hates you," commented Genryu.<p>"Speaking of which," said Ranma.<p>Akane strolled through the gates and her face fell as she noticed the mess in front of her. "What the? This again?"<p>"Actually, they were after me this time," commented Ranma.<p>"What? Why?" asked the girl as she stared at him for a moment.<p>"I'm not sure," said Ranma as he picked up one of the waking students by his collar. "Hello."<p>"What do you want?" snapped the boy indignantly.<p>"To find out what you want. Why did you attack me? What kind of idiots are you? I could have killed all of you."<p>"Ha! In your condition? You're lucky your friends protected you!" snapped the boy.<p>Ranma growled and stabbed the boy's thigh with his cane. "Wrong answer."<p>The boy screamed in pain and started jerking violently.<p>"What the?" said Genryu as he realized something. Something on his brother's cane he hadn't seen before. A twist of wire that coiled around it all the way to the base. "Ranma..."<p>"I'm busy," said the older boy as he dropped his prisoner on the ground and kept the cane stuck in his leg. "What made you get this idiotic idea in your head?" he asked the quivering teen.<p>"You humiliated all of us!" snapped the boy. "We heard you were injured, and decided to get revenge!"<p>"Humiliated? Oh, you mean when Kuno beat you all?" snorted Ranma as he turned his head and sent another jolt of power into the boy.<p>"What are you doing? You'll be killed!" cried Akane as she moved to stop Ranma.<p>"Don't touch me idiot, you'll get shocked!" he snapped irritably. She stopped moving towards him and he looked down at the boy. "I have to discharge some of the energy I collect, otherwise I'll overheat and burn alive. This could be a good excuse to do it, I just have to watch how much I use these days. That's all."<p>The boy stopped shaking and glared at Ranma hatefully. "Bastard. We'll..."<p>"You'll die the next time you attack me like the coward you are," he replied coldly. "I suggest you pass the word around to these fools as well. Don't confuse being injured with being weak." He collected his umbrella and started walking towards the school building.<p>++++++++++++++<p>TBC... Next Time: Grandpa Happy's Training!
