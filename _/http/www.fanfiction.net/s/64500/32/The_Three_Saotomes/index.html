</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 32<p>Moving on from Nerima.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome frowned as he stood in the waiting room of<br/>Tokyo General Hospital. His brother had not yet arrived, but<br/>Genma and Nodoka were both present in the sterile and florescent<br/>lit room with numerous plastic chairs that lined the walls. There<br/>were magazines strewn about carelessly, and a television gave a<br/>local news report.<p>He had grown to hate hospitals in the course of his life.<br/>He'd been inside them only a handful of times over the course of<br/>his training; most injuries were taken care of and tended on the<br/>road. That was how he thought it should be. However, there were<br/>times when places like them were necessary, and he accepted that<br/>fact.<p>Genryu rushed into the room with Ukyo at his side. He looked<br/>worried, but not too much. The Tendo family were friends, but not<br/>family in his mind. "What happened?"<p>Ranma simply glared forward with a scowl on his face as he<br/>watched the doors that led into the treatment area. "Midori."<p>"Damn," muttered the younger boy angrily.<p>"What?" said Ukyo in shock.<p>"Seems she's learned a bit since we've last seen her," said<br/>Ranma as he frowned at the girl for a moment. He was quite<br/>serious in his mannerisms.<p>"Is everyone all right?" asked Genryu quietly.<p>"No," was the simple reply.<p>Nodoka walked up to the boy and hugged her youngest son.<br/>"Genryu I'm sorry."<p>"What's going on? What happened?" pleaded the boy as he<br/>looked up at his mother in confusion.<p>"There was a bomb," said Ranma simply. "The Tendo house is<br/>gone."<p>"What?" stammered the younger boy in shock.<p>Ranma shook his head and sighed. "It's worse than it sounds.<br/>The dojo is still there, but the police are not finding any<br/>evidence, I doubt if they ever will. I'm sure that's not an<br/>accident."<p>"What does that mean?" asked Genryu in confusion.<p>"Nothing," replied Ranma simply. "If Nabiki saw the bomb, we<br/>still have nothing. I suspect any evidence linking Midori to this<br/>is already destroyed."<p>Soun Tendo, a man who had been sitting in silent tears until<br/>that point, stood up and looked the boy up and down in the most<br/>serious way. Genryu had never seen him like that before.<p>"We can't afford to repair the home," he stated simply. "The<br/>dojo still stands, but we will lose it all. My home is gone; I<br/>can barely afford to pay the bill for the hospital. Soon, the<br/>government will take everything away. I can't afford to pay the<br/>taxes on my home. There is nothing I can do to stop this. I have<br/>failed."<p>Genryu stared at the man in shock. "What?"<p>Ranma stared the boy down hard. "It gets worse."<p>The younger boy looked at his elder sibling in horror.<br/>"Worse?"<p>"Akane and Kasumi were just coming home when the blast<br/>happened, but Nabiki..."<p>The younger Saotome's eyes went wide as he stared at his<br/>brother in complete shock.<p>"Genchan?" muttered Ukyo.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>She opened her eyes slowly and groaned in pain. The world was<br/>nothing more than a bright florescent light over her head as she<br/>looked up from the hospital bed. It took a moment for her to get<br/>her bearings straight as she simply stared upwards.<p>"Where am I?"<p>"At the hospital, there was an explosion."<p>She pulled her head up to stare at the one who had spoken too<br/>her.<p>Kasumi was standing with a weak smile on her face as she<br/>looked at her sister. Her head was wrapped up in a large bandage<br/>that covered the entire top of her head, and her right eye.<p>"Explosion?"<p>"Yes, we were very lucky."<p>"Where is everyone?" she asked in confusion.<p>"Here, waiting outside. They'll be along to see us in a<br/>moment. I'm very sorry."<p>"Sorry?" confusion flooded her and then fear. "Sorry?" she<br/>looked up at her elder sister and stared at her for a long<br/>moment, hoping for an answer.<p>Kasumi turned her head away, unable to explain things.<p>"How long have I been here?" she asked calmly. Forcing<br/>herself to be strong and conceal any possible hint of fear or<br/>anger.<p>"About three hours," replied the elder girl simply. "They<br/>weren't expecting you to wake up until sometime tomorrow."<p>"We've always been a hardy family," replied the girl with a<br/>rough snort.<p>Kasumi smiled at this despite herself. "Yes, we are strong."<p>"What happened to me?"<p>The older girl's smile fell in an instant.<p>"I see," said the younger girl as she lowered her head. Her<br/>entire body felt like it was nothing more than a bruise. Her hair<br/>was matted and sweaty and hung down into her face messily. She<br/>reached up to brush it aside with her right hand, only to find<br/>nothing more than a white wrapping. A white wrapping that was<br/>about six inches too short.<p>She pulled her stump away from her face and stared at it with<br/>wide eyes. Horror was clear on her features as she slowly started<br/>to gasp as she stared at it. There was no concealment any longer,<br/>only horrified realization.<p>Kasumi Tendo rushed out of the room with tears in her eyes,<br/>unable to take the scene in front of her.<p>Nabiki Tendo slowly lowered her stump and flexed her left<br/>hand, if only to be sure it was still there. She tossed aside the<br/>sheets that covered her body and looked down at herself. The<br/>hospital gown hid most of her body from view, but it was pulled<br/>off with little difficulty.<p>Her entire body was wrapped in bandages; she could see the<br/>red markings of burn scars protruding out from behind the<br/>bandages in the few places that remained uncovered. Her right<br/>breast was mostly gone, along with a lot of the muscles on her<br/>right leg. She could actually see where chunks were missing out<br/>of her calf and thigh. Her torso was largely unmolested save the<br/>superficial burns.<p>The memory came to life inside her mind in one crystal clear<br/>revelation that would haunt her nightmares for years to come.<p>The bomb, she'd found it in the bathroom. Seconds ticking<br/>away, with only about fifteen remaining.<p>Her first reaction had been to freeze in terror; the second<br/>was to run. Unfortunately, she'd only just made it out the back<br/>door when the device exploded.<p>"Who? Why?" she muttered in her silent morbid afterthought.<p>The answer came quite easily once she'd put her mind too it.<br/>Who might have been a bit sketchy at first, but why was glaringly<br/>clear. "Ranma."<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Pink lips hidden in the shadows of the back seat of a<br/>limousine smiled darkly as she closed a cellular phone.<br/>"Excellent."<p>"Are your plans working?" asked the large bodyguard who drove<br/>the vehicle. The window between them rarely closed.<p>"Of course they are," she replied snidely. "That family is<br/>ruined, their position in my way easily eradicated. They'll never<br/>recover from this, I've ensured that."<p>"Of course, but they are weak and vulnerable now. That makes<br/>them dangerous."<p>"No. They have no standing, their assets are gone, and they<br/>are little more than a number added to the homeless. I have<br/>ruined them completely. Poverty alone makes them undesirable. The<br/>Saotome family will not have anything to do with them any longer.<br/>I know Mother in law well enough to know that at the very least."<p>The driver frowned. Midori was underestimating the family<br/>ties between these two clans. "You underestimate their friendship<br/>I think. Your target survived, and there is a witness as well.<br/>None of the family was killed in the explosion. "<p>"That is of little consequence," she replied simply. "Perhaps<br/>they will cling to this notion for a time, try to help their<br/>friends out so to speak. In time, when their financial situation<br/>becomes worse and worse..."<p>"I see," said the man with a serious nod.<p>"Heh. I'll have them so much in debt, that not even that lout<br/>Genma will speak to them. The honor system is such a wonderful<br/>thing at times."<p>The large man merely nodded as she laughed lightly behind<br/>him. It was a cold and vicious sound, but not entirely<br/>unpleasant.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>"How are you feeling?" Ranma stood over the hospital bed with<br/>his cane supporting him as he leaned forward towards Nabiki<br/>Tendo's prone form.<p>"Like shit," she replied irritably.<p>"That's odd, considering all the painkillers you're on at the<br/>moment," he replied simply.<p>The girl turned her head away from him in disgust.<p>"You think this is my fault?" he asked her calmly.<p>"Of course it is," she replied darkly. It had taken her a bit<br/>of time to realize just how doped up she was. Thinking clearly<br/>was a rather distant memory to her, and she didn't mind much. She<br/>held up her stump in his face and smirked from under her<br/>bandages. Half her face was covered. "Still want to get married."<p>"I don't think anything important is missing," he replied<br/>with a rather unusual grin.<p>"You think not?" she asked as she pulled her sheets down to<br/>reveal her single breast.<p>"Ouch," muttered the boy sympathetically.<p>"This is your fault you know," she said in a slurred tone.<p>"That's probably the morphine kicking in," he said as he<br/>noted the fresh bag hanging just over her good arm.<p>"Are you going to answer me or not?" she snorted irritably.<br/>She idly wondered if being drunk was similar to this experience.<br/>It wasn't all that bad, at least not yet.<p>"Well, I suppose you're right. You and your family are moving<br/>in with us. I doubt if that has anything to do with who's at<br/>blame though. It's more a case of the plotting fathers, and the<br/>immediate reaction of a family friend."<p>Nabiki frowned at that.<p>"I've got a sinking feeling that this is just starting," said<br/>the boy as he turned away. "Nabiki."<p>The girl looked up at him.<p>"You're in for some hard times, we will be there for you."<p>"That makes me feel so much better," she said sarcastically.<p>"I've counted you, and your family among my friends Nabiki.<br/>That may not mean much to you, but I am loyal if nothing else. No<br/>matter how hard it gets, I want you to remember that. We will<br/>never turn you away, even if your family must stay with us for<br/>the rest of your lives."<p>"What?" said the girl in shock.<p>"Midori is much more dangerous than you realize."<p>"I think I know," replied the girl sharply.<p>"In the coming weeks, you will find out what I mean. There is<br/>more than just physical pain to deal with when facing her. She<br/>will destroy you totally if she can, and she has the power to do<br/>just that."<p>Nabiki stared at him as best she could. It was becoming<br/>difficult to focus her eyes though. She tried her best to put<br/>forth a scowl, but it just wasn't in her.<p>"I'll send your father in before you pass out, and stop your<br/>sister from doing something stupid while there's still time."<p>Nabiki growled a little, then what he said registered,<br/>"Stupid?"<p>He walked out without another word.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo stared at the wall in front of her. Anger, rage,<br/>a blind fury had consumed her. Still, thanks to her sensei, she<br/>had focus, power.<p>She stood there looking strong as she glared at the white<br/>plaster in front of her with an angry and righteous frown on her<br/>face. Those around her gave a wide birth of clearance as they<br/>passed her in the hallway.<p>She was standing just outside the hallway, letting her anger<br/>fester and boil up inside her. Her gaze almost literally burned<br/>the paint on the wall as she stared forward, rigid, unmoving,<br/>enraged.<p>"If you keep standing there like that, someone is likely to<br/>call security."<p>She didn't even bother looking back at him. "Good. I could<br/>use a good fight."<p>"That's not a very healthy attitude to have," he chided<br/>calmly. "A battle like that, would do nothing but ruin the lives<br/>of others. This is not the time, or the place."<p>Akane turned to see Ranma standing behind her calmly. He<br/>seemed relaxed, at ease, and peaceful in his stature. A strange<br/>strength radiated from him as well, something she couldn't place<br/>her finger on.<p>"I won't let her get away with this."<p>"Neither will I. Attacking her, will only do harm to your<br/>family at this point. It will make her plan more successful than<br/>you imagine. It is best to wait."<p>"Wait for what?" screamed Akane.<p>"You are weak and vulnerable right now. An attack on her,<br/>will only serve to destroy the last remnants of what your family<br/>has left."<p>Akane turned away in disgust. "I'll make her suffer for<br/>this."<p>"Not as much as she'll make your family suffer if you do."<p>The girl turned to face him, hatred and rage were etched onto<br/>her features. "What do you suggest I do?"<p>"Nothing."<p>"How Buddhist of you."<p>"Sometimes he's right."<p>"Not this time." Akane turned away from him and stared at the<br/>wall in front of her. "I'll crush her, humiliate her, and then<br/>destroy her."<p>"What will that accomplish?"<p>"She won't be able to hurt my family anymore."<p>Ranma's tone had remained the same throughout the entire<br/>conversation. It did not waver even now. "No, but you will."<p>The girl's anger and rage peaked. "You think I'm not good<br/>enough?"<p>"Your skill doesn't matter here. You're simply not smart<br/>enough."<p>Akane fell off the deep end as her anger flared with such<br/>intensity that she couldn't hold herself back any longer. She<br/>thrust forward with her palms at the wall and screamed.<p>"Ryuu Hageshiku Okoru!"<p>Ranma simply stared in awe as a ball of red power exploded<br/>from the girl's hands. The wall in front of her crumbled down<br/>into dust and debris. She stood staring at it for a long moment,<br/>unapologetic.<p>"I will destroy her."<p>Ranma merely frowned as she looked back at him. "The Shishi<br/>houkou dan."<p>The girl's eyes went wide as she gasped at his immediate<br/>recognition of the altered technique.<p>"Focus all your rage in a single point, and then release it;<br/>a derivative of the move, possibly even more dangerous than the<br/>original. Akane, do you realize what you have unleashed upon<br/>yourself?"<p>The girl snorted. "I'm strong enough to face her."<p>"This will destroy you. You know that don't you?" His gaze<br/>was serious and firm. "Perhaps not as quickly, or as physically<br/>as the technique that has taken everything away from me, but it<br/>will do the same to you."<p>The girl lifted her chin defiantly. "I'll have revenge for my<br/>family yet."<p>"Even if it costs your soul?" insisted the boy as firmly as<br/>ever.<p>Akane nodded firmly, but somewhat reluctantly.<p>"Akane, what you will do to your family with this technique,<br/>is a hundred times worse than anything that Midori will do to<br/>them. I do not think Soun Tendo will be able to take the loss of<br/>another member of his family."<p>The girl stared at him firmly. "Our honor..."<p>"Is less important to your father than his daughter's<br/>wellbeing."<p>"What would you know?" snorted the girl.<p>"Perhaps, you should ask yourself that. You might understand<br/>the answer better than I can."<p>Akane smirked with viciousness easily read in her eyes.<br/>"You're worried that I'll become better than you."<p>"I'm more concerned that you might not," he replied simply.<br/>"The road to victory is always paved with sacrifice. The key to<br/>truly winning, is finding the path that takes the least from<br/>you."<p>The girl frowned deeply as she glared at him. Without another<br/>word, she turned away and started walking down the hallway,<br/>ignoring the frightened staff and patients that stepped out of<br/>her way without speaking.<p>Ranma merely watched her go with a somewhat sad look in his<br/>eyes. "I've got to do something about this...but what?"<p>He turned to go back to the waiting room with the rest of the<br/>family. All the while, a strange smile began to form on his face.<br/>If Genryu had been there to see it, he would have become quite<br/>nervous. After all, he'd seen it many times before, and nothing<br/>good had ever come of it.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>"I'm leaving. Genryu is coming with me, alone."<p>The two families turned to look at him in confusion.<p>"What?" said Ukyo angrily.<p>Ranma turned to face Kasumi and ignored her. "I'm sorry to<br/>leave at a time like this, but I've got a promise to keep."<p>Genma looked confused and nervous. "Promise?"<p>"Ryoga Hibiki said he would return in three days to defeat<br/>Genryu. He has to be ready for this technique, it is very<br/>powerful."<p>The boy blinked as he seemed to suddenly remember this.<p>"I'd say that gives us about a week to prepare," said the<br/>older boy.<p>Genma nodded. "I understand boy."<p>Ukyo looked a little upset by this. "What? I..."<p>Nodoka put her hand on the girl's shoulder. "Daughter, you<br/>have married a member of the Saotome clan. You are one of us now,<br/>and you must be prepared. This is a part of what it means to be<br/>the wife of a martial artist."<p>"He's not a waiter Ukyo," said Ranma as he looked at his new<br/>younger sister with a small amount of pity in his eyes.<p>The girl turned her gaze to the floor and growled. "I'm a<br/>martial artist too ya know."<p>"Yes, I know," replied the older boy as he smiled at her.<br/>"That's why I think you understand this."<p>The girl nodded reluctantly and stared at the older boy. "If<br/>he doesn't come back, I'm holding you responsible."<p>Ranma merely smiled at the confused reaction that got in his<br/>younger brother. "I'm sure you will. He's not in any real danger,<br/>Ryoga Hibiki has more bark than bite to him. That doesn't mean<br/>this should be taken lightly."<p>"Um, yeah," muttered Genryu as he looked both embarrassed and<br/>confused.<p>Ranma turned away and started walking towards the door. "Come<br/>on. We should get started."<p>Genryu blinked as he realized he was being left behind and<br/>jogged after his brother.<p>Ukyo glared at the doors as they closed after the pair had<br/>left. "He didn't even say goodbye."<p>"I suppose we'll have to scold him for that when he gets<br/>back," said Nodoka with a serious nod.<p>Genma swallowed a little at that, but quickly found an<br/>upside- down magazine article to take his mind off of it.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Several hours later...<p>Ranma stood on the top of a boulder in a forest. Genryu was<br/>standing on a small dirt patch in the middle of the clearing the<br/>pair had decided to train in. Their camp was about a quarter of a<br/>mile away in the woods.<p>"So, what's this move you want to show me?" asked the younger<br/>boy as he stared at his brother.<p>"First, you must learn the Shishi houkou dan, and then you<br/>can begin learning the new technique," said Ranma simply.<p>"What?" said Genryu in confusion. "But you said..."<p>"That it is a dangerous move? Yes. It is," he smirked as he<br/>looked down at his brother and sat down on top of the boulder in<br/>a relaxed position. "However, learning it, makes grasping the<br/>secret that much easier."<p>"So, what do I do?" said Genryu in confusion.<p>"You don't know?" asked his older brother with a slightly<br/>amused chuckle.<p>"What?" said Genryu irritably.<p>"I figured you'd picked something up from seeing it done,"<br/>replied the older boy casually.<p>"It's like a solid wave of air, he pushed it forward with his<br/>hands..." said the younger boy as he mulled over it.<p>"What else?"<p>Genryu looked up at his brother. "Like what?"<p>"Surely you noticed something," said Ranma patiently.<p>"He was actin a little funny," said the younger boy as he<br/>scowled a bit.<p>"Really?" said Ranma as he leaned back even further and laid<br/>down. He seemed quite relaxed and closed his eyes. "I suppose<br/>that had something to do with it then."<p>"I thought you were gonna train me!" snapped Genryu angrily.<p>"I am training you," said Ranma as he smiled and didn't move<br/>from where he was lying.<p>"Fine ya jerk! I'll figure it out myself!" Genryu stared at<br/>his hands and sat down in the dust. "I just gotta figure this<br/>out, that's all."<p>"You do that, wake me up when you figure something out," said<br/>Ranma as he finally relaxed completely.<p>"I will! Ya stupid jerk!" snapped Genryu irritably.<p>His only reply was a light snoring sound from the boulder<br/>behind him. Snorting in disgust he focused back on his problem.<br/>"How did he do that again? Hmmm...He did something with his<br/>hands. Is that it?"<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo stared out the window of her room. She'd be<br/>there for a couple of days, probably as doped up as she was at<br/>the moment. Painkillers were about to become a very large part of<br/>her life over the next year or so.<p>It was a depressing thought if nothing else. There was<br/>probably going to be a lot of that as well.<p>She was scarred for life, the burn marks were going to fade<br/>with time. They weren't that bad actually, most of the damage<br/>done to her body had been shrapnel from the blast; the same thing<br/>that had happened to Kasumi, but on a much larger scale.<p>She was aware that her body wasn't going to grow back. Her<br/>breast was gone forever, only expensive surgery would give that<br/>back to her, and it would never be the same. A lot of the damage<br/>could be repaired that way, it might take a few years, but she<br/>was fairly confident that she'd find a way to pay for it, even if<br/>it took a little time. Money management wasn't something she<br/>couldn't handle, even if she wasn't an expert yet.<p>Then there was her hand. There was nothing she could do about<br/>that, it was gone. A prosthetic limb would probably replace it.<br/>It wasn't something she liked, but she imagined she could learn<br/>to live with it.<p>Or maybe it was just the morphine talking.<p>She continued to look out the window. Tomorrow they'd put her<br/>on a less addictive, and less effective painkiller. She wasn't<br/>sure if she was looking forward to it or not.<p>One thing she was sure of, was that it was a long road of<br/>recovery ahead of her.<p>"At least you can still walk," she muttered under her breath.<p>After a moment, she cursed. She wasn't sure if she could or<br/>not, and didn't really feel like she should try to find out at<br/>that moment. Her leg was torn up pretty badly, but she could<br/>still move her toes. That was a good sign towards her somewhat<br/>cynical optimism.<p>She decided that being on less powerful painkillers wasn't a<br/>bad idea. She was a little more than muddled at the moment, and<br/>it showed when she tried to think.<p>It was a nice day outside and she sighed. A new wave of pain<br/>shuddered through her body and she barely noticed.<p>"I guess I'm not looking forward too it," she muttered under<br/>her breath as she relaxed a bit more and let her head sink into<br/>her pillow.<p>A light knock at the door caught her attention. Glad for any<br/>distraction she turned to face the source of the noise. "Come<br/>in."<p>Kasumi nervously entered the room with a smile on her face.<br/>It seemed so odd to see her with the bandage over her head.<p>"Is it bad?" asked Nabiki as she looked at her sister's head<br/>intently.<p>"Not really," replied the older girl with a slight break in<br/>her smile. "I wouldn't have used nearly this much bandage on the<br/>wound if I had wrapped it myself."<p>"Well, at least one of us can say that," replied Nabiki a<br/>little too cheerfully.<p>"How are you feeling?"<p>"Like shit," replied the girl simply. Also a little too<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Oh my," muttered Kasumi a little nervously.<p>"I'm starting to understand why Akane started talking like<br/>that. It's quite liberating."<p>It was easy to see that the older girl didn't approve, but<br/>didn't have the energy or the desire to scold her sister at the<br/>moment.<p>"I'm going to be all right Kasumi," she said simply. "Might<br/>not be as pretty as I was, but in a few years I can work on<br/>that."<p>The older girl nodded silently.<p>"I haven't seen Akane."<p>Kasumi blushed slightly. "She didn't take this well. She left<br/>just before Ranma and Genryu did. The rest of us will remain<br/>until we can take you home; well, Auntie Nodoka and I at any<br/>rate. I think Ukyo will stay as well."<p>"I see," said the younger girl as she nodded.<p>"We'll be able to take you...out of here, in a few days or<br/>so."<p>"Home is gone, isn't it?" said Nabiki with a slightly wistful<br/>chuckle.<p>"The house is gone, but the dojo is still there," said Kasumi<br/>with a small amount of cheer creeping into her voice.<p>Nabiki nodded silently. "Ranma told me we'd be staying with<br/>his family."<p>"Yes," replied the older girl with a blush on her face.<p>"I don't think we have to worry Kasumi. He seemed...honest."<p>"I know," said the older girl as she nodded seriously. "He<br/>always has been."<p>Nabiki frowned as she glanced up at the older girl. She<br/>looked like she believed what she had said with every fiber of<br/>her being. It was unsettling. "If you put this much faith in<br/>someone, you'll get hurt."<p>"I don't think I will," said Kasumi as she shook her head for<br/>a moment. "I love him."<p>Nabiki frowned. "I know."<p>"Even if I know I can never have him, I know he won't betray<br/>us Nabiki."<p>This caught the younger girl by surprise. "What?"<p>"Don't look so surprised Nabiki. He's a married man, and he<br/>has been since the day we met him."<p>Nabiki frowned at this. "That..." She turned the gears in her<br/>mind as fast as they would go. Remembering things from the past<br/>as best she could. It wasn't easy, and she gave up frustrated.<br/>She could think of nothing to argue Kasumi's claim with. Perhaps<br/>before the fateful tournament she could have, but since...it was<br/>as if she'd known a completely different person before those<br/>events. Everything he did had some sort of motive behind it,<br/>hidden though it might have been at the time. He made a lot more<br/>sense once she had learned more about him.<p>"That doesn't excuse him for bringing this down on us."<p>Kasumi nodded, her expression was completely unreadable. "I<br/>see."<p>Nabiki gave a humorless laugh as she noticed her sister's<br/>expression. "That doesn't mean he won't try his hardest to make<br/>up for it, does it?"<p>"No, it doesn't," said Kasumi as she cheered up again<br/>slightly.<p>"These people, they change the lives of others completely.<br/>Remember that Kasumi."<p>"I have realized that for some time now Nabiki," replied the<br/>older girl as she turned to leave. "You should get some more<br/>rest."<p>Nabiki merely nodded and went back to her thoughts. What was<br/>she going to do now? She had no real idea about how she was going<br/>to handle this situation.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Soun Tendo and Genma Saotome stood in the hallway staring at<br/>the hole in the wall just outside the waiting room.<p>"Saotome..." muttered Soun seriously.<p>"This situation is indeed grave Tendo," said Genma with a<br/>serious nod.<p>"What has happened to my little girl?" said Soun as he looked<br/>at the charred dust and debris that his youngest had left behind.<br/>It was quite obvious that she had not done the damage with her<br/>fists.<p>Both of them had been quite aware of what had happened in the<br/>hall from the moment it had occurred. Their training alerted them<br/>immediately. Genma was well aware that what he was now seeing was<br/>something his eldest son was incapable of doing.<p>Soun shook his head slowly and turned towards his friend. "My<br/>Akane. I fear what she might do."<p>Genma wasn't sure what to say or do. The girl was more than<br/>enraged by the events that had occurred over the past day. "We<br/>can only hope Tendo."<p>"We must find her Saotome," said Soun simply.<p>"Indeed Tendo," agreed the larger man with another short nod.<p>"That you should," said a quiet voice from behind them.<p>Both men froze in terror as they slowly turned to see<br/>Happosai standing behind them. He looked quite serious as he held<br/>his hands behind his back and moved between them to look at the<br/>destroyed wall.<p>"This is most serious Tendo," said the old man as he peered<br/>at his student for a moment.<p>Soun nodded slowly and cleared his throat. "What do you<br/>suggest master?"<p>"I would suggest that we find her and destroy her, she will<br/>only become worse with time, and will eventually destroy<br/>everything she hopes to save."<p>Soun gasped as he froze in terror.<p>"However, it is still early. Perhaps she can be turned back?"<br/>He looked up at the two men with a gleam in his eye.<p>"What are you saying master?" stammered Soun.<p>"Find your daughter Tendo. You may be her only hope, then<br/>again...perhaps there is another?" With that said he turned his<br/>head to look back down the hallway.<p>Several security guards rounded the corner at full sprint.<br/>"There he is!"<p>"Oops, gotta go!" chirped the old man cheerfully as he hefted<br/>a bag over his shoulder and bolted down the hall at full speed.<p>Genma merely nodded. "Well, that explains why no one<br/>responded to this mess. A blessing in disguise perhaps."<p>Soun merely looked at his old friend and then down the hall<br/>in the direction the master, and his pursuers had run. "Come<br/>Saotome. We have much to do."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Genryu struggled to figure out the dangerous technique a few<br/>yards away. It was slow going, but Ranma wasn't particularly<br/>worried about that. Genryu was smart enough to figure it out on<br/>his own. A little prodding, and the right information would be<br/>enough to get the boy where he needed to be.<p>He had other problems to deal with though.<p>Midori had shown just how dangerous she had become. More than<br/>even he had suspected she was capable of. He doubted if it would<br/>stop anytime soon. The Tendo family had nothing now, and she<br/>would make sure they would not recover to get in her way again.<br/>That made the situation even more dangerous, having them in his<br/>own home, with his own family wasn't something he thought of with<br/>a lot of comfort.<p>Genryu would be elsewhere at least, but his mother was<br/>another story. Midori would think nothing of removing her if it<br/>meant she might get rid of the Tendo family's perceived<br/>interference. That left him with a big problem.<p>She was very unpredictable, she used methods that would keep<br/>her out of danger personally, and she had enough money and power<br/>thanks to her family, that she could cover her tracks if she was<br/>less than careful at times.<p>He knew that the police would be of little help unless he<br/>managed to catch her red handed, with them present; a very<br/>unlikely situation, one that would probably be avoided<br/>intentionally by some rather high-ranking officials.<p>"So what the hell can I do about this?" he thought to himself<br/>as he continued to fake sleeping.<p>He knew he'd have to charge headlong into things sooner or<br/>later, it was just a matter of when and how. This wasn't a battle<br/>he could win easily with his fists, killing her that way would<br/>only bring more trouble. He'd have to outsmart her, outmaneuver<br/>her, not as easy as it sounded. She was powerful, her family was<br/>powerful, and she was dangerously smart.<p>He didn't have a clue what to do, or how to keep anyone else<br/>out of the mess he'd found himself in.<p>There was a simple solution though.<p>Ranma frowned involuntarily. "No. I can't do that."<p>Genryu continued to meditate, oblivious to all of this.<p>The older boy opened his eyes to look at his younger brother<br/>for a moment. He was stuck between a rock and a hard place at the<br/>moment. Midori wasn't likely to try the same thing again for a<br/>while. She'd wait and see how effective what she'd done so far<br/>had been, and make sure the Tendo family was being kicked while<br/>they were down. That left him a little time to think, but not a<br/>lot.<p>"Shit. Why can't this kind of thing just be simple?"<p>He was a Saotome, and knew that it never was that easy.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo stalked forward. She had no real destination in<br/>mind at the moment, she just walked.<p>Finding Midori was the focus of her mind. She had no idea<br/>where to start, but it shouldn't prove too difficult. Getting too<br/>her was another matter entirely.<p>The scene she'd made when she'd visited Furinkan made that<br/>obvious enough. The girl was rich, and probably part of a<br/>powerful family. That meant she'd be well guarded.<p>Sooner or later, she'd come back to Ranma though.<p>Attacking her around him wasn't an option either. She had a<br/>strong feeling that he'd do whatever he could to stop her. She<br/>even understood on some level.<p>The fire in her heart would not be satisfied with that<br/>though. She had to take revenge, justice. The girl would pay<br/>dearly and painfully for what she'd done to her family.<p>The only question was how.<p>"Damn," she muttered as she mulled over it. It would be best<br/>for her to avoid the man she called sensei for a time, but she<br/>knew that he was her best chance of finding the woman. It left an<br/>interesting dilemma for her.<p>"Feh, there are ways to find people, if you look hard<br/>enough," she growled as she pushed further into the city.<p>Ranma had taught her one thing though, she couldn't just<br/>charge in and lay waste to anything that got in her way. Her rage<br/>had to be focused, her skills sharp, she would have to plan and<br/>wait for a time to strike.<p>Opportunities like that didn't come often though, it would be<br/>an interesting game of cat and mouse. She just had to be sure<br/>that Midori didn't turn out to be a dog in disguise.<p>Akane clenched her fist and smirked as she turned a corner<br/>and found herself looking at a busy street in downtown Tokyo.<br/>People filled the sidewalks, and cars ran bumper to bumper in the<br/>street.<p>As she stood watching them she realized something. She was<br/>the most dangerous predator in the city at the moment. With a<br/>little caution, and a focus for her rage, she could destroy her<br/>enemies easily.<p>She turned to look up at the sun as it hung in the sky<br/>overhead, the flame in her eyes burned a thousand times more than<br/>the giant gas ball that warmed the planet.<p>She turned back into the street with a confident swagger<br/>about her as she pushed through the crowd easily. "I'm coming for<br/>you bitch."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Midori sat in a large office, she wasn't sure what it was<br/>for. It was really nothing more than a place for her to be during<br/>the day besides the home. She didn't do any work, and her father<br/>ran the company without her help, just a position that came with<br/>her name.<p>Idly she flipped the switch on her desk and spoke to the<br/>secretary outside her office. It was considered one of the best<br/>duties in the entire building. Like her, her secretary had little<br/>to do besides sit around and answer the occasional call.<p>Midori had no meetings, and usually took calls herself. Other<br/>than a few messages, the woman outside had little to do.<p>"Do I have any messages?"<p>"None today Midori, I'm going to lunch if that's all right<br/>with you."<p>"Yes, go ahead," replied the girl as she crossed her legs<br/>under her desk. She had a pair of black silk stockings on and a<br/>business suit that would send most of the male employees in the<br/>building into little piles of goo if they had seen her perform<br/>the action she had just done.<p>She turned her high-backed chair to look out the window with<br/>a smirk forming on her lips. She had her long blonde hair down at<br/>the moment and it cascaded down her back in golden curls as she<br/>stared out at the city below her. The people on the streets were<br/>nothing more than ants to her from this height. It was a fitting<br/>description as far as she was concerned. They worked to serve the<br/>queen, toiling their lives away so that the elite few could live<br/>in luxury.<p>"I think something interesting is about to happen," she said<br/>as she watched them for a moment. There was a tension in the air<br/>that hadn't been there earlier in the day. She couldn't explain<br/>it, but it thrilled her slightly.<p>"My darling Ranma, soon we'll be together forever, but I have<br/>a feeling that convincing you of this will not be easy." She<br/>smiled as she turned back towards the desk again. "I'll bet it<br/>will be quite interesting though."<p>"Makoto?" she flipped the switch as she said this. There was<br/>no answer. The woman's previous message seemed to be recalled a<br/>moment later. "Oh yes. Lunch." She flipped the switch off and<br/>relaxed. She'd ask her to retrieve the Tendo file when she<br/>returned, there was no hurry. She was the one controlling the<br/>game after all.<p>She turned back to the window once again and stared out at<br/>the street. At the moment, she was blissfully unaware of the<br/>dangerous new player she had unwittingly introduced into the<br/>game.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Ah yes. The build up. Suspense is killing you isn't it? ^_^<p>Well, you'll just have to wait until next time. Heh. Ja!
