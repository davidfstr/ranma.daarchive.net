</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 21<p>Let the Games Begin.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma sat looking out over the Tendo's back yard and smiled to<br/>himself. It was quiet, and calmness seemed to resonate throughout the<br/>home. The sun was rising over the wall, bathing the yard in a soft<br/>orange glow.<p>"Here," said Kasumi as she set down a cup of tea in front of him.<br/>She seemed distant today, not her normal cheerful self. She had been<br/>like that for several days.<p>"Thank you Kasumi," he replied as he picked up the cup and blew at<br/>the surface of the hot liquid for a moment before taking a small sip.<br/>"It's quiet."<p>"Yes," said the girl as she sat down next to him. "I always<br/>enjoy this time of day."<p>Ranma nodded and smirked as he sat back and leaned on the palms of<br/>his hands lazily. "It starts today."<p>"I know," she said quietly in reply. "Akane marked it on the<br/>calendar. I don't know if she's looking forward to it or not."<p>"I think she is, she's finally becoming what she's bragged about<br/>being since I met her," replied the boy with an almost wistful smile<br/>on his face.<p>"Oh? What's that?" said Kasumi with a slightly surprised glance.<p>"A real martial artist. She was so unfocused before, wild, unruly.<br/>I'm actually kind of proud of her. She's my first student. I hope you<br/>won't say anything to her," he answered without looking back at the<br/>girl.<p>Kasumi nodded and poured herself a cup of tea as well. "I think<br/>she knows that. That's why you bother her so much. She thinks you're<br/>always right."<p>"Hmm, could be," he shrugged absently and sat upright again,<br/>taking another sip of the drink for a moment. "Will you be coming? To<br/>the fights I mean? Nabiki is coming along."<p>Kasumi looked at him blankly and frowned. "No. I have no desire to<br/>watch you die."<p>Ranma paused for a moment and looked at her with a neutral<br/>expression. "Oh."<p>They simply sat together after that in silence, watching the<br/>sunrise.<p>+++++++++++<p>Genryu woke up and looked out the window of Ukyo's room. He sat up<br/>on his futon and saw his wife still sleeping on her bed, turned away<br/>from him. He stood there watching her for a long moment not sure of<br/>what to do. The sun was slowly rising in the distance, giving the town<br/>outside an almost shadowy appearance.<p>He looked up at the clock and saw the time; they still had a few<br/>hours before they had to go meet his brother, their brother. It was<br/>weird, thinking of her in terms of family now. He shook his head and<br/>walked out of the room, letting her sleep a bit longer.<p>About an hour later, Ukyo walked down the stairs lazily. Her face<br/>slightly confused, it settled after she saw him sitting behind the<br/>counter, with a cup of tea in his hands. He was just looking at the<br/>grill, and sitting alone. Without looking up at her, he spoke quietly.<p>"You're up."<p>"Um, yeah," she replied nervously.<p>"Well, I've got to go in a few hours. You're still coming?"<p>Ukyo merely nodded her head, despite the fact that he wasn't even<br/>looking at her. He didn't seem to care and continued to sit in<br/>silence. She moved over to his side and put her hand on his shoulder.<p>"You're worried?"<p>"Yeah, Ranma's been acting weird. I'm afraid of what he might do<br/>today," said the boy quietly.<p>"Well, they are trying to kill him," said the girl with an<br/>uncertain smile.<p>"He won't die. Not today, he's still got something he wants to do<br/>first," said Genryu as he sipped at his tea.<p>"You make it sound like he might let them do it," said Ukyo half<br/>jokingly.<p>"Not them. Her," said the boy quietly.<p>If Ukyo heard him, she didn't show it. "I'll make us breakfast."<p>Genryu merely nodded and continued to sit.<p>++++++++++<p>"Well, today's the day," said Tofu seriously as Xianghua met him<br/>in the small kitchen area of his home.<p>"Yes, it is," she replied seriously.<p>"You don't look very happy about it," commented the man as he<br/>moved by her with a cup of coffee in his hands.<p>"What makes you think I might enjoy it?" she said calmly as she<br/>poured herself a cup and sat across from him at the small table.<p>"I didn't mean to imply that," he said apologetically.<p>"I will avenge my brother, but this isn't something I'm looking<br/>forward too," she said as she relaxed in her chair. "I assume you've<br/>got your own reasons for going as well."<p>"I just want to make sure he can't hurt them," replied the doctor<br/>with a little more force in his voice than he had intended.<p>"Or, her?" replied Xianghua coolly.<p>"What of it?" said the man with a small smirk on his face.<p>"Just making sure. You can't back down, if you doubt, even for a<br/>moment, he will destroy you," said the woman calmly.<p>"I am firm in my convictions," said Tofu with a serious nod.<p>"Well then, shall we?" said the woman as she stood up from her<br/>chair and started towards the door.<p>Tofu blinked and looked up at her. "What? Now?" He quickly rose to<br/>his feet and followed after her.<p>++++++++++++<p>Matin stood in the doorway of his home, simply looking outside at<br/>the sunrise. He'd never actually watched one before, not seriously<br/>anyway. He simply stared forward and frowned as it slowly rose into<br/>the sky.<p>"I should go," he said out loud more to himself than anyone else.<p>"You're going somewhere?" said his mother as she walked up behind<br/>him in her robe.<p>"Yes. I have something to do today," he replied seriously as he<br/>turned to look at her. "I'll be gone all day."<p>His father came down the stairs, half dressed for work and blinked<br/>in surprise. "You're up early today...son."<p>"Yes, I know," replied the boy as he turned to look at the sun<br/>again.<p>His father frowned as he noticed that the boy was dressed in his<br/>dark blue dogi. The metal boomerang he had picked up somewhere was<br/>strapped across his back in the leather sheath he had made for it.<br/>"This is serious?"<p>"I have a promise to keep," said the boy with a shrug.<p>"To...a girl?" said the man hopefully.<p>"Dear!" snapped his wife irritably.<p>"Actually, yes," said the boy calmly. That stopped the argument<br/>that was about to happen cold. Both of his parents looked at him for a<br/>moment and said nothing.<p>"Oh my! What's her name dear?" said his mother with a huge grin on<br/>her face. "Is she pretty? What's she like?"<p>"I've got to go," he finally said as he walked out the door and<br/>left them standing there. He silently cursed his mother for a moment,<br/>she really should have known better than to ask him that. "I guess she<br/>was just excited," he muttered to himself as he walked.<p>++++++++++<p>Tatewaki Kuno stood out in his front yard, watching the sunrise<br/>like so many others. It was almost a morning ritual with him; he<br/>enjoyed such quiet moments. Simply contemplating his righteous battle<br/>with Ranma Saotome, and what forced Akane Tendo to deny her own<br/>feelings so.<br/>Then again, there was Ranma. Surely he was keeping her away from him<br/>somehow, with black magic no doubt. Still, things were not as bad as<br/>they seemed, he was no killer, and Akane was not so completely under<br/>his spell that she did not despise him openly. Then again, there was<br/>also the matter of his family blade.<p>He shifted his position and kneeled down placing his bokuten<br/>across the ground in front of him to meditate further on the problem.<br/>Ranma was indeed a worthy opponent to garner so much of his attention.<br/>A quest worthy of a true samurai indeed. He felt that the title was<br/>his now, for he not only wielded his bokuten, but a smaller, batto<br/>sized wooden blade as well. Ranma would surely fall under his might<br/>today. As would any opposition he met, after all, it was his destiny<br/>to save Akane Tendo from the villain's clutches.<p>Things were definitely going to go his way today; he slowly rose<br/>to his feet and smirked to himself as he turned back towards the<br/>house. After all, there was still a bit of preparation to do today.<p>He paused when he saw his sister standing outside, dressed in her<br/>gymnastics uniform, with her ribbon twirling idly in her hand. He<br/>frowned and walked over to her. "Sister, what are you doing?"<p>"Why, competing brother dear," said the girl snidely.<p>"I forbid it, Ranma Saotome is my concern," snapped the boy as he<br/>puffed up his chest and glared at her.<p>"Humph, I do not need your permission Tachi," said the girl snidely.<br/>"Besides, I'm going because an old rival of my is competing. You may<br/>remember her, the girl known as Akane Tendo. I have heard reports that<br/>she will be entering as well."<p>Kuno paused and nodded his head. He had not forgotten her<br/>humiliating defeat at the martial arts gymnastics tournament just<br/>prior to the Saotome brother's arrival. Akane was out of her element,<br/>and it showed in her skills at the time. Still, the girl had fought<br/>bravely, and avoided any serious injury, despite her inability to use<br/>any of the weapons effectively.<p>The boy smiled at his sister, he realized that this would not be<br/>the case this time. Kodachi would be the one out of her little pond<br/>this time,<br/>and Akane was infinitely more skilled than she was before. "Very well,<br/>because of this grudge with my beloved Akane Tendo. I shall allow it."<br/>He turned away from her with a smile on his face.<p>"That fool," muttered Kodachi to herself. The truth of the matter<br/>was simple. She couldn't care less about Akane Tendo; she wanted to<br/>see who this 'Ranma' was. He seemed most mysterious and interesting.<br/>If he was good looking to boot, well, she knew exactly what she'd do.<br/>She sliced up a practice dummy with a few quick flicks of her wrist<br/>and smiled darkly to herself as she watched it fall apart. "Mine."<br/>With that said, she began to laugh.<p>++++++++<p>"We are ready to go," said Cologne as she turned towards the two<br/>youths behind her. "Are you certain of this child?"<p>"Shampoo know what doing," said the girl seriously as she stood up<br/>and placed her bonbori across her back, she was also holding the<br/>bundled spear across her shoulder.<p>"This could be interesting," commented Mousse as he pushed his<br/>glasses up his nose. He smiled to himself as he imagined himself and<br/>Shampoo in the final battle together. They would fight, and he would<br/>allow her to win once again. Surely she would realize it this time,<br/>and be overcome with emotion for his pure hearted kindness. Thus, an<br/>new amazon love would bloom for sure.<p>Cologne sighed as Shampoo's aura flared with determination, thus<br/>putting another scorch mark on her nice clean floor. That spear made<br/>the girl stronger, and infinitely improved her skills with the time<br/>she had spent fighting with it across China. Then again, there was a<br/>down side to everything, if she wasn't careful, the girl could easily<br/>set fire to the building without realizing it. The old woman hung her<br/>head and resigned to berate her later, she needed that determination<br/>for the fight ahead. It wasn't easy to get Mousse to clean those burn<br/>marks of the ceiling either.<p>The boy in question, was over by himself, making out with a potted<br/>plant again,<br/>a plant that was no doubt Shampoo in his imagination. Still, the<br/>tournament would be good for them. It would show them both how<br/>superior the Amazon martial arts were in comparison to the rest of the<br/>world. Despite her insistence about finding that boy there. The flier<br/>had given them a name at least, Ranma Saotome, now they just had to<br/>figure out what his connection with that demon was. If there was any<br/>connection at all that is. That was one thing Cologne was a little<br/>more than certain about though, so it wasn't a real worry.<p>"Come Children, it's time we left," she said calmly as she walked<br/>out the door and into the street, with both teens following just<br/>behind her.<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma stood up and slowly started towards the door. "I'm leaving."<br/>He said calmly.<p>Akane blinked and looked up from her breakfast, she was wearing<br/>her yellow dogi and was not really paying much attention to what was<br/>going on. Genma and Soun had already eaten earlier and were both<br/>sitting on the porch, playing shougi.<p>"Make the Anything Goes School proud," said Soun with a small nod.<p>"Right," muttered the boy lazily as he turned away from them.<br/>Akane stood up and jogged after him, not saying a word as she fell in<br/>step behind him.<p>"Ranma, wait," said Kasumi as she walked out of the kitchen. She<br/>pulled on his arm and took him out of the hall, leaving Akane standing<br/>there in shock.<p>The boy stood dumbly, with a surprised look on his face as he<br/>looked at the girl in front of him. "What's up Kasumi?"<p>"Here," she said as she handed something to him. He put out his<br/>hand and accepted it, uncertain of what it was. He opened his palm and<br/>saw a simple cross, hanging from a very thin chain of gold. "For<br/>luck."<p>"I can't..." he started with a small frown on his face as he tried<br/>to return it.<p>"Take it. Ranma, I'd like to see you back, I'll make a place for<br/>you at dinner." The look in her eyes was almost pleading.<p>Ranma sighed and took it. "Kasumi, I'll do everything I can, to<br/>make sure you get this back. I appreciate it." He smiled at her and<br/>she turned away back towards cleaning up.<p>"I'd like that, it was my mother's," she said as she went back to<br/>work.<p>Ranma looked down at the necklace for a moment, and closed his<br/>hand around it. "Kasumi... I'll see you around."<p>The girl merely nodded, not willing to turn back and face him<br/>again, no matter how badly she wanted too. When she finally had the<br/>courage to do so, he was gone. At least he had the decency not to say<br/>'goodbye'.<p>+++++++++<p>Akane met him out in the yard and frowned at him for a moment.<br/>"So, are you finished flirting with my older sister?"<p>"Don't be an ass Akane. Kasumi's a good friend, and I'm probably<br/>the only one she's had in a long time. She's worried," replied the boy<br/>coolly as he passed her.<p>Akane blinked and growled at him. "Kasumi's got lots of friends!"<p>"Oh? Name one," replied the boy as he continued walking away.<br/>Akane rushed up beside him and kept up his pace.<p>"Dr. Tofu!"<p>"Who can't even speak with her he's so hopelessly in love with<br/>her. Try again," said Ranma.<p>"Um, that guy at the grocery store! She knows everyone there?"<br/>said Akane with a horrible realization starting to dawn on her.<p>"She sees them for about two minutes of every day, and exchanges<br/>pleasantries. I've seen it enough times to know, those are<br/>acquaintances, not friends."<p>Akane looked at him blankly. "You're Kasumi's friend?"<p>"We talk a lot, both of us keep the same hours. We're both up<br/>late, and get up early. Sometimes, it's just the two of us up,"<br/>replied Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"You keep your hands off her! Pervert!" snapped Akane as she found<br/>herself suddenly angry.<p>"Ah, to be so young and stupid again," muttered Ranma to himself<br/>as the girl fumed behind him. She was grumbling to herself, something<br/>about "Kasumi" and "Perverted Hands".<p>"If we fight each other today, I'll show you how perverted they<br/>can be," replied Ranma snidely.<p>Akane glared at him, with her temper rising even further. She<br/>managed to control herself and was finally content to merely stare at<br/>his back angrily.<p>"Hey, Ranma!" called a familiar voice from overhead. Both Akane<br/>and Ranma turned to see a familiar figure smirking down at them from<br/>the top of a wall.<p>"Well, it's nice to see you still have a way with women," said<br/>Taro with a small chuckle.<p>"Hey, how ya been?" said Ranma cheerfully as he raised his hand in<br/>greeting.<p>"Unlucky as ever. I still haven't found the bastard," said Taro<br/>angrily. "I guess I can help you out for today."<p>"Thanks, I need all the help I can get," said Ranma honestly.<p>"I could have told you that you lazy bastard," grumbled Akane<br/>irritably.<p>"So, she's still as cheerful as ever I see," commented Taro as he<br/>jumped down<br/>beside her.<p>"Shall we go?" said Ranma as he jerked his thumb down the road.<p>+++++++++++<p>A short time later, on a road that led to the train that would<br/>take them out of Tokyo into a small town just outside the city, they<br/>met Genryu and Ukyo. The pair was standing together, simply waiting.<p>"Hi, you two kids have fun last night?" said Ranma playfully.<p>"Shut up," grumbled Genryu.<p>Ukyo merely blushed and frowned at the boy. Taro let out a small<br/>chuckle and shook his head as he continued walking.<p>Ranma smirked at their reaction. "Good, we've got a long day ahead<br/>of us. I don't need the both of you worn out already."<p>The pair nodded silently and followed after him as he started<br/>walking again. Each giving him a glare that would easily kill a lesser<br/>man.<p>The train ride was peaceful; everyone kept their thoughts to<br/>themselves as they walked out of the station and onto the road that<br/>led out of town.<p>They soon found themselves standing in an open field; most of the<br/>others were there already. They stood around waiting, in the middle of<br/>the field, was a concrete rink, it was made up of square slabs laid<br/>flat in the ground that raised about two feet off of the ground.<p>There were also a good number of spectators, mostly from Furinkan,<br/>with a large number of curious parties as well. The tournament was<br/>well advertised in the Nerima area thanks to the thousands of fliers<br/>put out. There was easily a hunded people standing around the rink.<p>Hakama stood up from a chair set up near the rink and spread his<br/>arms. "Welcome."<p>"Lets get this over with," grumbled Ranma angrily as he glared at<br/>the boy.<p>Taro snorted his agreement and nodded. "We'll get that bastard,<br/>don't worry about that."<p>"We've still got a little time before the events are scheduled to<br/>start. Have patience," said Hakama as he sat back down. There was a<br/>small box next to his seat, covered by a white cloth. Ranma noticed it<br/>and said nothing as he walked over to his team and sat down on the<br/>ground along the outside of the rink.<p>The opposing team was resting opposite him, with Hakama off to the<br/>right of them.<p>Ranma raised his eyebrow as Cologne stepped out of the crowd and<br/>eyed him for a moment. Just behind him, Mousse and Shampoo stepped up<br/>and walked up to the edge of the rink, sitting opposite Hakama. They<br/>were all looking directly at him, although that was questionable in<br/>Mousse's case.<p>"What the hell are they doing here?" said Ranma as he watched<br/>them. Shampoo nodded towards him and said something to her companions.<p>"Huh?" muttered Genryu as he looked over at them for a moment. "Oh<br/>man! These guys again?" he grumbled as he recognized Shampoo.<p>"That girl is coming over here," said Taro with his eyebrow<br/>raised.<p>"You, lightning boy," said the Amazon as she approached Ranma.<br/>"Name is Ranma, yes?"<p>The boy nodded to her in reply and frowned. "What do you want<br/>here?"<p>"Amazons lift kiss of death, you no is in anymore danger," said<br/>the girl with a small bow towards Genryu.<p>Ranma blinked and looked at her dumbly. "Huh? Thanks?" She stared<br/>at him for a moment and said nothing. "Why?" he said finally.<p>"Peoples hunted by demon free of Amazon law. Amazons hunt demons,"<br/>replied the girl with a small shrug. "If demon want persons dead,<br/>Amazons want persons alive. Is simple."<p>Ranma nodded at this and smiled slightly. "You've been hunting<br/>that thing? In China?"<p>"Yes, Shampoo fight many battles with monster. Never defeat it,"<br/>said the girl with a small frown.<p>Genryu looked at her in shock. "You fought that thing?"<p>Shampoo blinked again and glared at him angrily. "Of course!<br/>Shampoo greatest warrior of Amazon tribes! She come all the way to<br/>Japan to help kill monster!"<p>Ranma sighed and put his hand up, before his little brother opened<br/>his mouth again. "Fine, thanks. We can use all the help we can get<br/>today."<p>"Okay," said the girl with a small shrug as she turned to walk<br/>away from them.<p>Ukyo looked at the two boys and frowned. "Demon? What demon?"<p>Ranma sighed and hung his head. "It's a long story, I'll tell you<br/>later."<p>The girl frowned, but seemed to accept this for the moment. She<br/>settled back and relaxed a little.<p>"Hey!" called Ranma as he stood up and jogged after Shampoo for a<br/>moment. The Chinese girl turned to face him and frowned again.<p>"What is it?"<p>"Just one thing. This is Japan, not China. No matter what happens,<br/>your laws don't apply here. This is much too serious for a husband<br/>hunt, and there are a lot of skilled fighters. I want your word. No<br/>kiss of death, and no kiss of marriage."<p>Shampoo blinked and looked back to her great grandmother for a<br/>moment. The old woman narrowed her eyes at the boy for a moment before<br/>looking back at the girl again. She sighed visibly and nodded her<br/>head.<p>"Very well, Amazon laws not matter today," muttered the girl<br/>with a small frown.<p>Shampoo watched him walk back to his place, and moved over to her<br/>group. Cologne frowned slightly. "He knows of those laws?"<p>"Yes," replied the girl with a small shrug.<p>"Interesting... this is the boy that you speak of?"<p>"Is him, Shampoo not forget face," replied the Amazon as she<br/>glanced over her shoulder for a moment at him again.<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes and studied the boy for a moment.<br/>"Impossible! That boy has no aura!"<p>"Maybe, is just hiding it?" said Shampoo absently.<p>"No child, the younger one is hiding his quite skillfully. This<br/>boy, he is like a walking dead man. I'm getting nothing from him,"<br/>said Cologne as she settled down in her seat and continued to stare.<br/>"This is most interesting."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Nodoka Saotome stood in the field; Nabiki Tendo stood beside her<br/>with a frown on her face. "I can't believe they left without me," she<br/>commented as she panned her camera across the field. It was a<br/>camcorder, and probably pretty expensive too.<p>"There is my son," said Nodoka as she looked over at Ranma and<br/>Genryu. "I do not see my husband here."<p>"He didn't come," replied Nabiki coolly.<p>"I shall speak with him about that later," said the woman with a<br/>frown. "I see my son is sitting with his wife, and his brother."<p>"Yeah, that girl with the long hair next to them is Akane, she's<br/>my sister," said Nabiki as she pointed the camera at them for a<br/>moment.<p>"This is the one you say my son is instructing?" said Nodoka<br/>warily.<p>"Yup, she's gotten much better. I think she's madder at him for<br/>that than anything else," deadpanned Nabiki.<p>"I see," said the older woman as she glanced over at the crowd<br/>across the field. "These are the ones who are against him?"<p>"Yeah, that blonde woman. She's the one trying to kill him, the<br/>others I'm not so sure about. I think they just don't like him," said<br/>Nabiki as she smiled up at the woman.<p>A man dressed in a cloak walked up beside them and paused, it was<br/>apparent he had been listening in to the conversation. "Are they<br/>trying to kill Genryu Saotome?"<p>Nabiki looked him up and down and frowned. "That will cost you."<p>He looked up and glared at her for a moment, not saying anything.<br/>She returned the gaze coolly, with a tight smile on her lips.<p>"I'll find out soon enough," he replied as he lowered his head<br/>again and walked over to the opposing crowd.<p>"Genryu?" muttered Nodoka as she watched him leave. "What does he<br/>want with my son?"<p>"I dunno," said Nabiki with a small shrug. "We'll find out sooner<br/>or later."<p>Hakama stood up and eyed the newcomer for a moment. "Well, who<br/>might you be?"<p>The boy removed the hood of his cloak and grinned as he heard<br/>Ranma mumble under his breath. "Shit."<p>"My name is Ryu Kumon. I've come for Genryu Saotome's life," said<br/>the boy confidently.<p>"Oh, you're over here then," said Hakama as he pointed over to the<br/>crowd opposite Ranma and crew. "We'll be starting shortly."<p>Ryu nodded and Hakama sat back down, picking up a notebook, he<br/>made a few changes.<p>Ryoga Hibiki appeared behind him glancing around frantically. "Now<br/>where am I?"<p>Hakama jumped up and whirled around on is feet, glaring at the boy<br/>angrily. "Who the?"<p>"Oh, I'm here," said Ryoga with a surprised look on his face. "It<br/>only took me a month to find it!"<p>Hakama briefly wondered why he sounded so happy about that, and<br/>frowned as she shook it off. "Ranma, or non-Ranma?"<p>"Huh?" muttered Ryoga as he looked at him dumbly for a moment.<p>"Do you want revenge on a Saotome, or are you here to support<br/>them?"<p>"Oh, Genryu Saotome! Prepare to meet your destiny!" cried Ryoga as<br/>he pointed at his target and glared for a moment.<p>"Fine, this way please," muttered Hakama. He thought it would be a<br/>good idea to personally escort him to his spot.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Looks like everyone showed up," commented Genryu lazily.<p>"And then some," agreed Ranma as he eyed Kumon for a moment.<p>"I can handle that guy," snorted the younger Saotome arrogantly.<p>"Don't get cocky, he's probably got a new trick or two up his<br/>sleeve," said the older boy with a small frown.<p>"Like I don't?" snorted Genryu lazily.<p>"You might be a bit rusty, don't let it go to your head kid,"<br/>snorted Ranma in reply.<p>"Right," muttered Genryu dejectedly.<p>"Humph, boys," muttered Akane and Ukyo at the same time. They<br/>paused and looked at one another for a moment, before turning away<br/>again.<p>++++++++++<p>Tofu sat with Xianghua and Matin with the other's keeping a safe<br/>distance away from each other.<p>"Why is Akane over there?" wondered Matin out loud.<p>"I thought he was training her?" commented Tofu.<p>"She's been helping me. She hates him as much as we do," said the<br/>boy in reply.<p>Xianghua glanced over at the girl; she looked quite determined.<br/>"Perhaps not, people can change their minds."<p>"I doubt that," commented Matin. "She taught me how to beat her<br/>own style. It takes more than a passing annoyance for someone to do<br/>that."<p>Tofu looked at him for a moment and then back to Akane again. "She<br/>always did hold grudges, even if she's a nice girl otherwise. I'm<br/>inclined to agree with him."<p>"Whatever her reasons, they're none of our business. Maybe she's<br/>just being loyal to her school?" said Xianghua with a small frown.<p>The others nodded at this assessment and sat in silence after<br/>that.<p>+++++++++<p>Hakama stood up and grinned at the crowd, spreading his arms wide.<br/>"Welcome to the Strongest Under Heaven! It is time to begin. I'm not<br/>much on formalities, so we'll get right into things. Let the battle<br/>begin!"<p>The gathered crowd cheered as he sat back down and pulled up the<br/>clipboard, preparing to announce the first match.<p>TBC...<p>Next time: The first match! The action really begins!<p>
