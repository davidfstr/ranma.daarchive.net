</div>Ranma 1/2<p>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 24 Tournament: Round 3<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma faced off against Matin and smirked. His opponent merely<br/>scowled at him angrily, not particularly caring about Hakama's signal<br/>to start the battle.<p>"Aw, he beat me to it," commented Ranma as he glanced up at Hakama<br/>for a moment.<p>"You've got other concerns," commented Matin as he spread his feet<br/>apart and frowned.<p>"Right, let's see what you've got," agreed Ranma as he followed<br/>suit casually.<p>"Come on!" snapped Matin as he launched himself into the air.<p>Ranma followed him and they clashed in mid air, punching and<br/>kicking each other as they passed. They landed opposite one another<br/>and stood still for a moment, until Ranma clutched his side and fell<br/>down to one knee.<p>"Not bad."<p>"You're finished this time," snorted Matin in reply as he turned<br/>to face the boy.<p>"Don't get cocky, you're don't have as much of an advantage as you<br/>seem to think," replied Ranma as he slowly rose to his feet and<br/>cracked his knuckles as he turned to face the boy again. He took up a<br/>stance and smirked lazily, eyeing Matin coolly.<p>"Changing styles won't save you," said Matin with a small frown.<p>"Maybe, maybe not. We'll see," commented Ranma lazily as he took a<br/>slow step forward.<p>"Come on then!" snapped Matin as he charged towards his opponent<br/>on the ground this time.<p>Ranma sidestepped and put his knee into the boy's belly. Matin<br/>managed to get an elbow into his hated rival's chest. They both were<br/>thrown back by the blows, and skidded to a stop on the concrete,<br/>raising a cloud of dust as they did.<p>"You're better than I thought you'd be," commented Ranma with his<br/>smirk never fading away.<p>"You haven't seen anything yet," snarled Matin as he spread his<br/>feet apart again.<p>"Let's turn it up a notch then," said Ranma as he attacked again,<br/>rushing forward and spinning into a kick aimed at Matin's head.<p>The boy deflected the blow with his arm and countered with a<br/>sweeping kick of his own; Ranma hopped over the strike and sent a<br/>short kick out towards the boy's exposed chest. It was blocked by an<br/>open handed strike that spun Ranma around in the air.<p>Matin jumped back as Ranma twisted in the air and landed in a kung<br/>fu stance with his arms spread wide and his chest lowered slightly.<p>"This should be a pretty interesting battle, you've earned my<br/>respect," commented Ranma with his eyebrow arched slightly.<p>"I'm glad to hear it," deadpanned Matin as he leaned back on his<br/>rear leg and put his fists up. "Come on, let's not take all day."<p>++++++++++++<p>"That bastard! How dare he use my style!" snapped Xianghua as she<br/>noticed the stance he had take up. She stood up and clenched her fists<br/>angrily.<p>"Calm down," said Tofu as he pulled on her hand and forced her to<br/>sit down again. "You'll get your shot at him, I doubt if this one is<br/>enough to beat Ranma."<p>"How would you know? He seems to be doing well," commented the<br/>woman as she glared at him for a moment.<p>"Ranma isn't even trying, I haven't even seen a hint of his battle<br/>aura yet. I'm ashamed to say it, but he was able to beat me without it<br/>as well."<p>"Oh, that," grumbled Xianghua. "Ranma doesn't ever use his, I've<br/>fought him to near death before. He's never once used it against me,<br/>he has something else. Something better."<p>Tofu narrowed his eyes at her for a moment. "What do you mean?"<p>"I can't say what it is, I'm not sure," she replied calmly.<p>Tofu merely nodded at this and remained quiet.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Akane trained you well," commented Ranma as he blocked a quick<br/>jab. "But you're missing the basis of the Anything Goes School."<p>Matin jumped back as his attack failed and frowned. "What do you<br/>mean?"<p>"You're a skilled martial artist, I'm sure you'll catch on. Like<br/>all other styles, Anything Goes has a basic style that is its core.<br/>However, the prime tenant of the school, is to learn all you can from<br/>other styles, and use the best components as the situation fits. Akane<br/>never understood that, and it is her most basic weakness. That's the<br/>reason your plan will fail."<p>Matin took up a more defensive posture and nodded. "I figured as<br/>much. You don't think that's the only trick I've learned do you?"<p>"I hope not, I've always enjoyed these fights," replied Ranma<br/>coldly as he rushed forward again.<p>"Ha!" snapped Matin as he moved to intercept him.<p>Ranma waited for him and kicked at his head, the move was blocked,<br/>but Ranma managed to hop back and kicked him in the gut with a short<br/>snap before he could react. Matin staggered back clutching his belly<br/>and snarled. Ranma rushed forward, pressing his momentary advantage,<br/>punching at the boy and scoring a few hits before he recovered. Matin<br/>slashed out and punched Ranma's fist after a moment and the pair<br/>locked, pushing against each other's arms.<p>"Not bad," commented Matin with a smirk appearing on his face.<p>"You haven't seen anything yet," replied Ranma as he mirrored the<br/>expression. They jumped away from one another and moved back into<br/>combat stances once again.<p>Matin ran towards Ranma again after a moment and attempted to push<br/>him back with a punching combination. Ranma jumped over him<br/>completely, kicking back with his leg and catching the boy in the back<br/>of his head. "Phoenix defends from sky!" He spun in midair and blocked<br/>the kick that was meant to retaliate against the move as Matin fell<br/>forward.<p>"Ha! You'll have to do better than that!" snapped Ranma with a<br/>smirk.<p>"Fine then!" snarled Matin angrily as he pulled the boomerang from<br/>his back and spun it on his palm for a moment. "Let's see you deal<br/>with this!"<p>Ranma jumped back and smiled broadly. "You don't think that will<br/>work again do you?"<p>"You haven't seen anything yet!" screamed the boy as the metal<br/>blades suddenly lit up with a blue flame. "Silver Flash!"<p>Ranma's eyes went wide as he jumped up to avoid the impossible<br/>speed with the boomerang moved as it cut through the air towards him.<br/>"Damn!" he muttered as it curved back towards him, forcing him to tuck<br/>into a ball and roll across the ground. He kicked his legs out as<br/>Matin punched at the ground in front of him, barely missing. Matin<br/>pressed his attack, punching and kicking at the boy, forcing Ranma to<br/>jump back as the boomerang suddenly cut through the ground between<br/>them.<p>"That's a good trick," commented Ranma with a frown as he moved<br/>farther away from both the projectile and his opponent. "But you have<br/>to concentrate, and it's costing you speed."<p>Matin chuckled as the glowing disk hovered directly beside his<br/>head. "You're just blowing off your mouth now. You can't beat me."<p>Ranma cupped his hands at his sides and frowned. "We'll see about<br/>that." A low buzzing noise filled the air, as Ranma suddenly began to<br/>glow with a blue energy field that sparked against the ground. "Come<br/>on." His hair began to rise slowly into the air.<p>"That won't work on me again!" snarled Matin as he pointed towards<br/>his opponent. The boomerang swooped towards Ranma, forcing him to jump<br/>back. It missed and sailed high into the air, curving upwards.<p>"Eat this!" screamed Ranma as he thrust his hands forward,<br/>blasting at Matin with a ball of energy.<p>The boy crossed his arms in front of him, and Ranma's eyes went<br/>wide as his energy blast was intercepted by the spinning boomerang,<br/>only to disperse harmlessly into the air. "What the?"<p>"Surprised?" said Matin with a small chuckle.<p>"Come on then!" cried Ranma as he rushed forward. The projectile<br/>spun away from Matin, moving into the air above the battle.<p>"Ha!" cried the boy as he attempted to intercept Ranma. He punched<br/>out at him and his opponent didn't even attempt to block the strike.<br/>He felt his hand strike flesh, and suddenly an intense pain raced<br/>through his body.<p>Ranma smirked as Matin began screaming as the energy that<br/>surrounded him coursed through the boy's body. "What's the matter?<br/>Can't touch me?"<p>Matin managed to pull his hand away and gasped for a moment with a<br/>look of shock on his face. "You..."<p>"Gee, I wonder what would happen if I hit you?" said Ranma as he<br/>held up his fist and allowed the energy to crackle across his knuckles<br/>for a moment.<p>"I won't be beaten so easily!" cried Matin as he jumped back away<br/>from the boy. The boomerang dove towards Ranma, forcing him back as<br/>well as it cut through the air around him, narrowly missing him at<br/>numerous points as it circled around him, twisting and turning through<br/>the air.<p>Matin wasn't finished though, he stood back and watched for a<br/>moment, before snapping his arms straight down revealing two slim<br/>metal objects. They almost looked like rods of metal. With a flick of<br/>his wrists, two more smaller boomerangs appeared in his hands. "Die!"<p>++++++++++<p>"What the hell is that?" screamed Akane in shock as she watched<br/>Ranma glow with power.<p>Genryu and Taro looked at one another with almost exactly the same<br/>frown on their faces. Ukyo just looked shocked and confused, not able<br/>to say anything. She found herself feeling greatly relieved that she<br/>had changed sides all of a sudden.<p>"What is that?" repeated Akane firmly as she looked at Genryu.<p>"That? That's nothing, just residual static electricity he's<br/>collected over time," replied the boy calmly.<p>"Collected?" gasped Akane in shock as she stared at him.<p>"Great Grandmother wrong, is not impossible," said Shampoo calmly.<br/>Mousse looked at her in confusion for a moment and said nothing,<br/>before returning his gaze to the fight again. Ryoga had a similar<br/>expression on his face and merely nodded.<p>"Keep watching," said Taro calmly.<p>++++++++++<p>"Come on then!" screamed Ranma as he moved across the field at an<br/>amazing rate of speed. His arms thrust out, and another ball of energy<br/>shot from his hands, only to be deflected once again by the now<br/>glowing smaller boomerangs.<p>"I won't lose!" cried Matin as he launched both of the weapons at<br/>one time. Ranma twisted and ducked as he was assaulted from three<br/>different angles, finally ducking under the largest of the boomerangs<br/>and rolling across the ground.<p>Matin screamed as Ranma rolled out of his trap and ended up<br/>directly in front of him, sending his fist into the boy's gut. He<br/>stood there, screaming in pain as the electric energy coursed through<br/>his body, preventing him from moving. Finally, the scream stopped as<br/>the blades fell to the ground from their hovering positions in the<br/>air. He slumped down onto the concrete and lay still.<p>Ranma stood up, huffing for breath. The crowd was completely<br/>silent and did not make a single sound as he walked out of the ring.<br/>Even Hakama was looking at the scene in silence. His face was a cold<br/>scowl though. Remembering exactly what he had felt as a result of this<br/>strange power.<p>"I'll make sure you suffer for that Saotome."<p>+++++++<p>Nabiki was shaking, she didn't know why. Her camcorder was still<br/>pointed at the ring taping the silent scene for a long moment. She<br/>tentatively lowered the camera and flicked the power off, stopping the<br/>tape. "My god."<p>Nodoka said nothing, merely watching the scene in shocked silence.<br/>"Nabiki, tell me what that was," she managed finally.<p>"I..." stuttered the girl quietly.<p>"It seems my husband has much to answer for," said Nodoka solemnly<br/>after another short silence between them.<p>++++++++<p>"Did you see that?" stammered Tofu as he looked over at Xianghua<br/>with worry etched on his face.<p>"Indeed I did," replied the woman calmly. "I have seen this once<br/>before."<p>"And you still want to fight him?" muttered the man. He was<br/>looking at her as if she was crazy.<p>"No. I have to. You let me worry about that now," said the woman<br/>coldly.<p>Tofu merely nodded and said nothing else.<p>+++++++++++<p>It was several minutes before the crowd collected themselves.<br/>Hakama stood up and spread his arms once again.<p>"As I said. We will find out who is the strongest after all."<p>The crowd responded at last, cheering wildly. No one had expected<br/>anything close to this.<p>He waited calmly as they settled and picked up his clipboard once<br/>again. "The next battle is an interesting one indeed. Ryoga Hibiki,<br/>versus Akane Tendo!"<p>Akane stood up and walked into the ring. Ryoga followed just<br/>behind her, and cursed to himself.<p>"What was that about?" said Genryu as he looked towards his<br/>brother.<p>Ranma looked tired and shook his head for a moment. "Huh? Oh,<br/>that. He's just mad cause he has to fight a girl, that's all."<p>"Why is mad?" said Shampoo in confusion.<p>"That pig," muttered Ukyo under her breath. She was giving Ranma<br/>nervous glances on occasion and clinging to her husband's arm. Genryu<br/>looked slightly annoyed by this, but did nothing to stop her.<p>Ranma chuckled at the reactions. "Ryoga is good, he might actually<br/>win this fight."<p>Taro looked at the boy for a moment and smirked. "Not giving your<br/>student much credit are you?"<p>"Heh. You've fought Ryoga, don't act like you don't know he's<br/>easily a match for her. Who knows, she's improved a lot. She may be<br/>able to pull it off."<p>+++++++<p>"Back out now. I don't want to hurt you," said Ryoga as he stared<br/>Akane down in the middle of the ring.<p>"Don't be stupid, I'm going to hurt you," replied Akane angrily.<p>Ryoga looked at her with a small amount of surprise at that<br/>announcement. "Look lady, you don't know what you're dealing with."<p>"Heh, I know exactly what I'm dealing with. Genryu can't beat me<br/>as fast as he took you out jerk."<p>"Why you dirty little..." muttered Ryoga under his breath. He<br/>hefted his umbrella up onto his shoulder and spread his feet.<p>"That's more like it," said Akane darkly as she smirked at him.<p>"Fight!" cried Hakama as he slashed his arm down and signaled the<br/>start of the battle.<p>Akane took the initiative immediately. Jumping towards Ryoga and<br/>punching him dead in the face.<p>The lost boy staggered back and grunted in pain. He stepped back<br/>and growled. "You'll pay for that!"<p>"Stop talking and fight!" screamed Akane as she kicked him in the<br/>gut.<p>"Damn you!" cried Ryoga as he finally rushed forward grabbing for<br/>the girl.<p>She easily evaded the attempted grapple, and grabbed one of his<br/>extended arms, flipping him over her head. He landed sprawled out on<br/>the ground and rolled back onto his feet as she released him.<p>"Damn it!" cried Ryoga as he brought his umbrella up across his<br/>chest as Akane pressed her attack. The girl jumped back as her strikes<br/>were blocked.<p>"Not bad," she said with a small chuckle as she cracked her<br/>knuckles by flexing her fingers for a moment.<p>"I won't be beaten by some girl," snorted Ryoga, more to himself<br/>than her.<p>"What makes you think I'd let a boy beat me?" replied the girl as<br/>she rushed forward and attacked again.<p>+++++++++<p>"So...that's it," muttered Nabiki as she watched her sister fight.<p>"What is it?" said Nodoka in surprise.<p>"A comment like that would have sent Akane off the deep end a few<br/>months ago. I get it now, all that he's done too her..." she looked<br/>over at Ranma with a scowl on her face. "It's still not good enough to<br/>forgive him," she told herself.<p>"I see, he is a good teacher then?" muttered Nodoka to herself not<br/>really hearing Nabiki's final comment to herself.<p>++++++++++<p>Akane performed an axe kick that took Ryoga in the jaw, he<br/>staggered back and frowned as he regained his balance punching as soon<br/>as he did so. Akane was forced to step back to avoid the strike and<br/>spun into an elbow strike. Ryoga did the same, and the pair locked up,<br/>pushing against one another.<p>Ryoga grit his teeth and stared into the girl's eyes. He wasn't<br/>moving her, despite all his strength, she was still pushing just as<br/>hard as he was. "No way..." he muttered to himself. Finally, with a<br/>grunt of effort, Akane was forced to break the lock as she found<br/>herself being pushed back.<p>"You're stronger than you look," commented the girl as she rotated<br/>her shoulder for a moment.<p>"So are you," replied Ryoga with a frown. He tossed his umbrella<br/>aside and put up his fists.<p>"Giving up?" said the girl with a small smirk.<p>"It's just a dead weight against you," he replied with his eyes<br/>narrowing suddenly.<p>"Come on then!" snapped Akane as she charged forward again.<p>"I'll overpower you little girl! You don't stand a chance!"<br/>snapped Ryoga as he met her charge head on.<p>The pair collided, Ryoga had a fist pushed out in a punch, but<br/>Akane merely shifted to the side slightly, and brought up her knee<br/>into his gut. The boy lurched forward, but remained standing. Akane<br/>was far from finished though. She elbowed him in the back of his head,<br/>forcing him down further, and then performed a quick hop back.<br/>Spinning on her heel she spun around in a spin kick style maneuver,<br/>and caught Ryoga's neck with the back of her knee, applying a choke<br/>hold as she continued spinning and forced him back and onto the<br/>ground.<p>Ryoga's eyes went bloodshot as he felt his air supply cut off and<br/>struggled for a moment. Finally, he regained his wits and grabbed the<br/>girl's leg, pushing up with all his strength, it was barely enough. He<br/>took a quick gasp and pushed himself up by kicking his legs out and<br/>sliding his head under her leg.<p>Akane was not even phased by the maneuver. She spun around as soon<br/>as he was free and performed a sweeping kick that caught him across<br/>the knees, sending him back onto the ground, continuing her spin, she<br/>leaned into a punch that hit him dead in the face as he landed on the<br/>concrete again. The ground behind his head shattered under the force<br/>of the blow, and he stopped moving.<p>Akane stood up and dusted off her dogi absently. "Not bad at all,"<br/>she commented looking the boy over for a moment. Finally, she turned<br/>towards her companions and started to walk back over to them.<p>+++++++++++<p>"She won," commented Taro.<p>"Ryoga was holding back. She would have lost had he gone all out,<br/>like he did against Mousse," said Ranma lazily.<p>"Well, she did good I thought," said Genryu with a small shrug.<p>"Yeah, she did," agreed Ranma quietly as he watched her approach.<p>"Well?" said Akane as she sat down next to him.<p>"Well what?" replied Ranma obliviously.<p>"Aren't you going to say something?" she snapped irritably.<p>"Um...nope," said the boy with a shrug.<p>Akane suddenly remembered why she hated him. "Jerk."<p>"All this exercise is making your chest smaller," commented Ranma<br/>absently.<p>Akane's hair bristled slightly and she glared at him for a moment.<br/>Finally, she crossed her arms over her chest and turned her nose up at<br/>him. "Fine! Be that way!"<p>Ranma shrugged and looked over as Ryoga was brought to the<br/>sidelines again. "Man, out cold. How hard did you hit him?" He poked<br/>the lost boy in his chest absently for a moment.<p>Akane blushed, but continued to ignore him.<p>+++++++++<p>Hakama stood up as the cheers of the crowd died down once again.<p>"The battles are far from over my friends! Next up! Genryu<br/>Saotome, versus Pantsuto Taro!"<p>"That bastard! I'll kill him!" said Taro as he jumped to his feet.<p>"Calm down Taro," muttered Ranma lazily.<p>"Yeah, we got a match Pantyhose boy," said Genryu with a small<br/>snort as he stood up.<p>Ukyo looked at him in shock for a moment, and then back at Taro.<p>"Oh, I'm going to enjoy this Fem-boy," snapped Taro as he cracked<br/>his knuckles.<p>"Nah, I don't think you will," said the younger boy confidently.<p>"My condolences on your husband," said Taro as he looked at Ukyo<br/>for a moment.<p>The girl looked towards Ranma and frowned. "Aren't you going to do<br/>something? I don't want Genryu to die!"<p>"Huh? Don't worry, Taro and Genryu like each other...sort of,"<br/>said the boy with a shrug.<p>"Sort of?" muttered Akane as she looked at him.<p>"You people worry too much. They'll be fine, I guess..."<p>"You guess?" snapped Ukyo with complete terror written across her<br/>face.<p>+++++++++<p>TBC...<p>
