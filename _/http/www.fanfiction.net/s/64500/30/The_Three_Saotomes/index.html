</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 30<p>Explosion of love!<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome sat in class and stared at the teacher. He wasn't<br/>really paying attention, and no one seemed to notice or care. He was<br/>blissfully free of any real annoyance, save for a few easily ignored<br/>glares from a few of his classmates. It was a nice feeling to know<br/>that no one would bother you. Kuno was ignoring him completely, and<br/>several boys from the class had still not returned from the morning<br/>attack, causing their girlfriends to glare at him hatefully.<p>"Shit," he grumbled as he thought about that. "What the hell were<br/>those idiots thinking?" The boys had gotten wind of his injury<br/>apparently, and had taken it upon themselves to gang up on him. It was<br/>the result of a beating the majority of the boys in the school had<br/>gotten after defeating Akane Tendo with his help. Kuno hadn't taken it<br/>well, and he had manipulated the idiots into thinking they could beat<br/>him. His frown became more pronounced at that. "Idiots."<p>Still, there wasn't much he could do aside from seriously hurting<br/>a few and hoping the rest would get the message. No big deal really.<br/>He wasn't able to take on any of his rivals at the moment, but the<br/>idiot mob was nothing compared to Matin or Xianghua.<p>The teacher lobbed an eraser at his head for his inattention, and<br/>he caught it idly, placing it on the corner of his desk after peering<br/>at it curiously for a moment. "What is it?"<p>The man blinked and stared at him for a moment before disregarding<br/>the boy in favor of the lesson. "Never mind Saotome."<p>"Heh, right."<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"You've found him?" A pair of pink tinged lips spoke into a cell<br/>phone calmly. A woman sitting inside of a limousine, shrouded in<br/>shadows smirked as she felt a warm feeling rush over her body. She was<br/>wearing a business suit with a low cut skirt and dark pantyhose. A<br/>huge round and black hat rested on top of her dark brown hair. She<br/>wore a pair of shades that concealed her eyes from view. After<br/>listening to the reply she nodded to herself calmly. "Furinkan High<br/>you say? Excellent." She closed the phone, folding it in half before<br/>putting it inside of her handbag carefully.<p>She chuckled to herself as she shifted her legs, uncrossing and<br/>then crossing them again. "Well...it has been a while hasn't it?" She<br/>reached into her purse and removed a small photo. "I've found you at<br/>last."<p>Placing the worn looking photo back into her bag, she pressed a<br/>small button on the armrest at her side. "Take me to Furinkan High."<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Genryu Saotome paused and shuddered for a moment. He felt a chill<br/>run down his spine and he jerked upright suddenly.<p>Ukyo blinked and looked at her husband for a moment. "What's with<br/>you?"<p>"Nuthin," replied the boy as a slightly confused frown crossed his<br/>face. "Feels like someone just walked over my grave, ya know?"<p>The girl shook her head and went back to the small grill in front<br/>of her. She was selling lunch to the crowd at the moment, and didn't<br/>think much about the boy next to her at the moment.<p>Genryu had other thoughts. "That feeling..." He'd been around<br/>enough curses and magic to not ignore something like the feeling he'd<br/>just gotten. "Something bad is coming soon." His frowned deepened as<br/>he realized that he'd probably be the one to handle it. Ranma was in<br/>no condition for anything serious at the moment.<p>As if summoned by the boy's thoughts, Ranma walked up to his<br/>little brother and frowned down at him. "Did you feel that?"<p>The younger boy nodded slowly. "Yeah, something is comin."<p>Ranma snorted and shook his head. "Right. It's best not to ignore<br/>that feeling. We should be ready."<p>Genryu nodded carefully and stared into the crowd.<p>Ukyo smacked him in the back of his head, ruining the seriousness<br/>of the moment. "What the hell are you two idiots talking about?"<p>"I just got a bad feeling," grumbled Genryu as he rubbed the back<br/>of his head. "Stupid Uncute Tomboy! Why'd ya hit me?"<p>"Because you're scaring off my customers! You too! Get lost!"<br/>snapped the girl as she glared at Ranma.<p>"Huh? Me?" said the older boy dumbly.<p>"No one is going to come here while you're standing there!<br/>Everyone is avoiding you!" snapped Ukyo.<p>"Treating your own family so! What would mother say!" said Ranma<br/>with false tears forming in his eyes.<p>"That I've got good business sense! Scram!" snarled Ukyo as she<br/>pushed him away forcibly.<p>"Yeah. I know when I'm not wanted," said Ranma as he started<br/>walking away. This caused Ukyo to stumble forward a little, as she<br/>suddenly found no resistance to her shoving. "Genryu, I'll talk with<br/>you about this later on. See ya." The boy waved back at the pair<br/>casually, without looking back at them as he walked off.<p>"A bad feeling?" she muttered as she turned to stare at Genryu.<p>"Hey! I know better than to ignore stuff like that!" he retorted<br/>irritably. "Too much bad stuff has happened to me before. I know what<br/>it feels like."<p>Ranma chuckled to himself as their voices faded as he moved away<br/>from them. The last thing he heard was a familiar clanging sound<br/>followed by an angry girl's voice. "And who the hell are you calling<br/>Uncute!"<p>"I guess there's some things he'll never learn," said the older<br/>boy calmly. He paused and stared down at the cane in his hand for a<br/>moment. He was feeling a little light headed and leaned on it heavily.<br/>"Damn..." It took a moment to catch his balance again, but the feeling<br/>passed rather quickly. "Shit. This could get annoying." He continued<br/>on his way, putting just a little more of his weight on the cane than<br/>before.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Ryoga Hibiki stared forward. His eyes were vacant and simply<br/>stared at the road in front of him as he trudged onward. "Genryu, I<br/>probably won't be able to defeat you...but I must try anyway. My honor<br/>demands it." He sighed and hung his head a little lower as he walked.<p>After several minutes of trudging onward in silence, he came<br/>across a man pulling a cart along the road.<p>Ryoga paused and slowly turned his gaze towards the man.<p>He was a skinny balding man in his late sixties. He stared at the<br/>boy with wide eyes and stepped back slightly.<p>Ryoga spoke up. "You probably won't be able to help me, but could<br/>you tell me where I can find Furinkan High?"<p>The old man raised his hand shakily and pointed down the road.<br/>"Tokyo is about a hundred miles that way," he whispered calmly.<p>"Really? Thanks," muttered Ryoga halfheartedly. "It'll probably<br/>rain before I get there." He looked up at the sky again, ignoring the<br/>endless light blue as he stared directly at a tiny white puff of a<br/>cloud.<p>The old man shuddered as he watched the boy walk away. "That<br/>boy...I've never seen anyone with eyes so full of despair. It's like<br/>he's a dead man walking!"<p>The lost boy trudged onward, giving a small humorless chuckle as<br/>he overheard the old man. "Death...might not be so bad after all..."<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma smirked to himself as he stared at the open lot in front of<br/>him. It was little more than a patch of dirt. However, the tiny old<br/>man sitting in the middle of the lot hummed to himself cheerfully. He<br/>had a small fire going, and was holding a stick with a sweet potato on<br/>it into the flame. "Hey Grandpa."<p>"Eh?" muttered the diminutive man as he turned to look up at the<br/>boy. "Ranma! How've you been boy?" Happosai cheerfully turned back to<br/>his potato as the boy walked up to his side.<p>"Fine I guess," replied Ranma as he stared at the man's food.<br/>"Making a snack?"<p>"Good food makes for a sound body," said Happosai cheerfully. "I'd<br/>offer you some, but I'm a growing boy you see..."<p>"Ha! Still as greedy as always I see," said Ranma in amusement.<p>"Come for training have you?" said Happosai as he turned the<br/>potato over a few times.<p>"You offered didn't you?" replied Ranma wryly.<p>"Hmmm. So I did. You've got quite a problem though," said Happosai<br/>as he turned his head to look at the cane in the boy's grip.<p>"Yeah, quite the crutch so to speak," said Ranma with his smirk<br/>fading slightly.<p>"We'll see what we can do about that," said Happosai. "What I need<br/>to know boy, is exactly when you died, and when you were planning on<br/>telling everyone you were dead?"<p>Ranma blinked at this and said nothing for a moment. "I..."<p>"Come on boy, out with it," said Happi calmly.<p>"It's not the same as being dead," said Ranma as he turned his<br/>head away slightly. "I'm just...not in here anymore."<p>"Hmmm," said Happosai as he nodded. "I don't know much about that<br/>technique of yours I'm afraid. It shouldn't be too difficult to fix<br/>though."<p>"Fix? It's not something you can 'fix' old man," said the boy<br/>indignantly. "I'm not dead...I'm just..."<p>"Not alive?" quarried Happosai.<p>"I am! I can feel, I can breathe, I can even have children!" said<br/>Ranma with a heavy snort as he turned his back on the old man.<p>"Can you?" asked Happosai as he seemed to think about this a bit<br/>more.<p>"It's hard to explain what it's like..." said Ranma as all the<br/>anger flooded away from his face at once. "It's sort of like I'm<br/>driving my body... I've just got to keep it charged up is all..."<p>"So, you're a vampire then?" asked Happosai as he stared at the<br/>boy with wide eyes.<p>"No!" snapped Ranma. He paused and thought about it.<br/>"Well...kinda...yeah. I guess I am in a way. I just take energy from<br/>somewhere other than blood. I kinda overheated my engine a bit<br/>though." He patted his chest a few times and sat down next to the old<br/>man with a smirk on his face.<p>"Humph! The body is not a machine!" snapped Happosai.<p>"Just an analogy," said Ranma defensively. "Don't get all mad at<br/>me!"<p>"I suppose it's a start..." said Happosai as he sighed and pulled<br/>his potato out of the fire. He lit his pipe and puffed on it a few<br/>times for a moment. "I guess we should get started then."<p>"Right," said Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"Okay boy, it's time to begin then!" Happosai jumped to his feet<br/>and started walking out of the lot.<p>Ranma blinked as the old man turned the corner and vanished. He<br/>simply sat there and waited for a moment. Nothing happened for several<br/>seconds. He smiled to himself and reached out to touch the abandoned<br/>sweet potato. He had no intention of eating it; he didn't even like<br/>them to be perfectly honest. No sooner than his finger came to within<br/>a half inch of the potato...<p>Happosai burst around the corner and quickly dashed over to the<br/>boy's side. "Right after I finish my lunch!" He snapped up the potato<br/>and started to eat it cheerfully.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma blinked as he looked down at the diminutive old man and<br/>smiled. "A bathhouse?"<p>"That's right boy, we've got to get you back into shape!" said<br/>Happosai cheerfully as they stood behind the building. There were<br/>several windows just below the roof of the building.<p>"Okay, I'm game," replied the boy with a shrug.<p>"Come on, this should get your blood flowing!" said Happosai<br/>cheerfully as he jumped up to one of the ledges. It was small, but he<br/>was short enough to crouch down and peer inside without hanging on.<p>Ranma shrugged his shoulders and jumped up, performing a pull up<br/>to peer inside with the old man. "What's the point of this, besides<br/>the obvious I mean?" said Ranma as he grinned and peered at the nude<br/>women inside.<p>"You've got to exercise that muscle of yours," said the old man as<br/>he turned his head and smiled at him. "This should get your heart rate<br/>up!"<p>Ranma nodded and continued to watch the women bathe inside. His<br/>father would have made him run a few laps or something to accomplish<br/>the same thing; more like a few hundred or so. He turned towards the<br/>old man again. "Okay. I guess it's working a bit."<p>"See anything you like?" asked the old man cheerfully.<p>"That one is pretty nice," replied Ranma as he pointed out a<br/>particularly well endowed woman in her mid twenties.<p>"True, there are a lot of younger ones as well," said Happosai<br/>thoughtfully. Several young girls were inside the room as well.<p>"Yeah, I can appreciate that as well," said the boy as he searched<br/>the room over and picked out a few older teens that weren't quite as<br/>developed. "Still, something has to be said for a fully developed<br/>woman."<p>"I agree, there's more life in the younger ones though," said<br/>Happosai.<p>"Not as much experience though," pointed out Ranma.<p>"That's true as well," said Happosai.<p>Ranma pointed towards a girl of about thirteen. "She'll be cute<br/>when she's older."<p>Happosai nodded. "It's already pretty apparent. A shame she's<br/>still a little young though."<p>"Wonder how long till they notice us?" asked the boy.<p>The old man smiled at him cheerfully. "We'll see."<p>"Then the chase starts right? That's fun too!" said Ranma with a<br/>knowing smirk.<p>"I knew I liked you for a reason boy!" quipped Happosai.<p>"EEEK! Perverts!" cried a voice from within the room.<p>"Here we go!" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>They remained still, watching as the women scrambled around the<br/>room. It was enjoyable to say the least. The women were all running or<br/>diving into the water, throwing things at the closed window. Watching<br/>them run was an experience in itself.<p>After about two minutes of this, a few of the women had managed to<br/>dress themselves at least partially and were starting to emerge from<br/>the front of the building, armed with various mops and other cleaning<br/>utensils.<p>"Time to go!" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>The pair dashed off, with the women and girls in hot pursuit.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>The chase was fast paced and frantic. The women were lobbing<br/>anything they could at the pair, and several others had joined the<br/>pair in the street. That was mostly due to Happosai stopping to grope<br/>anyone who caught his eye whenever he could.<p>Ranma was a bit more subdued and concentrated on running alone. He<br/>was very aware of how his body was reacting to the chase. So far he'd<br/>had no trouble and was enjoying himself.<p>The pair turned into an alley between several homes and the mob<br/>was lost for a moment. Happosai jumped up to the windows and the<br/>clothes lines that hung there. He cheerfully plucked a few of the<br/>panties and bras hanging there off and stuffed them into a sack.<br/>"What? Don't you want some?" he said as he noticed Ranma standing<br/>below him.<p>"Nah. That's your thing," replied the boy with a cheerful grin. He<br/>hopped up next to the man and jumped over a few windows skillfully.<br/>"This is more my thing. Hi how's it goin?"<p>The nude woman was in the act of getting dressed when she turned<br/>her head and stared at the boy waving at her from her windowsill.<br/>"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!"<p>"Oops. Gotta go!" said the boy as he noticed the mob react to the<br/>scream from the street outside. He winked at her and jumped away,<br/>landing on the pavement in a run again.<p>The woman blinked and looked down at herself for a moment.<br/>"Hey...he was kinda cute..."<p>"Hotcha!" said Happosai as he appeared in her window and leered at<br/>her for a second before dashing off.<p>"AAAAAAAHHHH!" cried the woman in revulsion.<p>Happosai quickly caught up with Ranma and chuckled as he bounced<br/>along.<p>The boy blinked and slowed suddenly. "Uh-oh. Game's over old man."<p>"Eh?" said Happosai as he turned in mid jump and watched as Ranma<br/>stopped suddenly. He slammed into a wall that he hadn't seen. It was<br/>blocking the street and he shook his head for a moment. "Oh..."<p>The crowd of women surrounded Ranma as he sat on the ground.<br/>"Whoa, that was interesting. Hi." He grinned at them all and they<br/>glared at him with their makeshift weapons held ready. "Boy. This is<br/>going to suck."<p>Happosai was hidden away behind several trashcans as the women<br/>beat on his student. "Oh Ranma! You've made me so proud! Sacrificing<br/>yourself so that I could get away!" Tears filled his eyes as he<br/>watched and did nothing. It was good for the boy; he would build up a<br/>lot of stamina that way.<p>Ranma was taking a rather nasty beating. He wasn't screaming in<br/>pain or anything, but it was still rather brutal. A few of the women<br/>had already backed off by this point.<p>He was lying on the ground covered in scratches and bruises at<br/>this point. "Ouch."<p>"Pervert!" snapped one of the more upset women as she kicked him<br/>in his balls.<p>Ranma reacted to this and rolled over onto his back, clutching<br/>himself in pain. "Heh. It was worth the peek pretty lady."<p>The woman flushed, partially out of embarrassment, but mostly in<br/>anger at the boy's audacity. "You pig!" She kicked him in the chest,<br/>but there wasn't too much heat in it.<p>The crowd started to disperse and left him lying there.<p>After several moments, Happosai appeared next to the boy and<br/>sighed. "Well boy, they really did a number on you. You didn't have to<br/>stop though."<p>"I'd have collapsed in a short time if I didn't," replied the boy<br/>with a small chuckle. "My heart got quite a workout though. Thanks old<br/>man," replied the boy with a slightly pained chuckle as he sat up.<br/>"I'd have kept this up all day if I could have."<p>"That's the spirit boy!" said Happosai cheerfully.<p>"So, now what?" asked Ranma as he pulled himself up to his feet<br/>and grabbed the discarded cane from a small puddle. He wiped it off a<br/>little and leaned on it as he stood up.<p>"We should get something to eat now!"<p>"Sure thing," replied the boy cheerfully. He started walking after<br/>the old man and felt his strength returning to him slowly.<p>"I know a place!" cried Happosai as he bounced away.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma grinned at the old man as he sat in a booth with him. There<br/>was a bottle of sake between them, and a modest meal. The partially<br/>nude women who were feeding them helped him relax even more. They<br/>fawned over him and the old man.<p>"Bwahahahahahahaaaa!" cried Happosai as he nuzzled the naked<br/>breasts of one of the strippers. She grinned at him with her disgust<br/>barely hidden away.<p>"Hey, we're gonna pay right? I kinda might wanna come back here,"<br/>said Ranma as he looked at the old man for a moment.<p>"Don't be stupid boy! Of course we are!" said Happosai. "This<br/>isn't some run down yakitori! I'm a regular here!"<p>"Oh. Cool," said the boy as he smirked at the old man and let one<br/>of the girls use her chopsticks to put some of the beef from one of<br/>the plates into his mouth.<p>The woman giggled at him and kissed him on the cheek. Ranma noted<br/>a few more of the girls were hanging off of him than the old man.<br/>"Hey! I ain't the only one paying here! Give my grandpa some attention<br/>too!" He shoved a few of them towards Happosai and they reluctantly<br/>complied.<p>Happosai had tears of joy in his eyes. He had at last found his<br/>true heir! If only he could find a way to rid the boy of his problem,<br/>he'd ensure the continuation of the school for generations!<p>"What's after this?" asked Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Hmmmm...It's unfortunate that you're still in school...we could<br/>always go to the locker rooms if I could train you during the day."<p>Ranma blinked at this. "What are you kidding?"<p>"Eh?" said Happosai as his head jerked around to the boy.<p>"There's a volleyball tournament at the school tonight! I know<br/>when all the sports teams will be having matches!" said the boy<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Oh Ranma! You've made me so proud!" said Happosai as he burst<br/>into tears again. He nuzzled his head into one of the stripper's chest<br/>and she twitched slightly. "Comfort me!"<p>The woman patted him on the back somewhat reluctantly, but didn't<br/>shove him off. He was a good customer after all.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"Shhhh," said Happosai as he peeked around the corner to the<br/>girl's locker room and found it empty. He hopped inside and searched<br/>around. "The coast is clear!"<p>"Course it is. They're all in the gym playing ball right now,"<br/>said the boy as he strolled in casually.<p>Happosai bounced into the room and froze in horror. Every one of<br/>the lockers had a padlock on it. "Oh no!"<p>Ranma blinked at this and looked at the man for a moment. "What's<br/>the problem?"<p>"They've imprisoned all the silky darlings! How could they be so<br/>cruel? Don't worry my babies! I shall free you!" He bounced up to one<br/>of the lockers and began to tug on the lock rather pathetically.<p>Ranma tapped him on the shoulder and sighed. "Step aside old man."<p>"Eh?" replied Happosai dumbly.<p>"Heh, they've all got key locks on them. That's good, this would<br/>be harder if they'd used combination locks." He pulled a pin out of<br/>his hair and smiled at the old man for a moment.<p>"Why are you wearing that?" asked Happosai.<p>"Always be prepared," replied Ranma as he quickly picked the lock<br/>and popped it open. "Man, they didn't even get the good key locks. I<br/>might have had a bit more trouble with a tumbler."<p>"Quickly! To work boy! We've got to free as many of the silky<br/>darlings as we can!" cried Happosai as he quickly pilfered what he<br/>wanted out of the locker.<p>Ranma nodded at this and almost did a double take at the inside of<br/>the locker. "Whoa!" Sitting partially hidden inside the back was a<br/>photo of a naked Akane in the bath. He plucked it out and stared at it<br/>for a moment. It actually had a lipstick mark on it. "Heh. Well, I'd<br/>hate to disappoint one of your fans, Akane." He put it back and turned<br/>to the next locker.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>The lockers were now all cleared and Ranma smiled in satisfaction<br/>as he watched Happosai cheerfully hug his huge sack of gym shorts and<br/>underwear.<p>"Come on! Quickly boy!" chimed the old man.<p>"Huh? What we're leaving?" said the boy as he stared at him.<p>"Course we are!" said Happosai dumbly. "What do we have to wait<br/>for?"<p>Ranma shrugged. "We could always hide and wait for the girls to<br/>come back and change."<p>Happosai paused and blinked at this. "Another chase?"<p>"Nah, the point of this time is not to get caught," said the boy<br/>cheerfully.<p>"An empty locker?" asked Happosai dumbly.<p>Ranma shook his head. "That's the first place they'll look."<p>"Where then?" said Happosai as he grinned at him.<p>Ranma merely pointed at the ceiling tiles above them. They were a<br/>flimsy cardboard like substance that hid the real ceiling from view.<p>Within moments the pair was sitting on the wall between the locker<br/>room and the showers. They were hidden away by the pseudo ceiling and<br/>had a good view through the various cracks of the aged material.<p>"Ingenious!" gasped Happosai as the girls started to enter the<br/>room. They were sweaty and chattering amongst themselves.<p>Happosai was riveted to the scene with drool coming out of his<br/>mouth as he watched. The girls were showering on one side, and<br/>changing on the other. It didn't take the girls long to figure out<br/>they'd been robbed. The reaction was short lived though, they were<br/>somewhat used to it by this point.<p>"I was sure those locks would work!" cried one of them angrily.<p>Ranma noticed that she was the one with the photo of Akane in her<br/>locker. She was a young blue haired girl with a nice figure. He<br/>smirked as she checked for the photo when no one was watching and<br/>breathed a sigh of relief after she found it.<p>"Heh. Not bad Akane," he said to himself.<p>"Akane? Where!" whispered Happosai in excitement.<p>"She's not here. Just thinking to myself," replied the boy calmly.<br/>He wasn't all that interested in the goings on below him any longer.<br/>He did have to stop Happosai from bursting into the room at several<br/>points and held the old man tightly in his grip with his hand over his<br/>mouth. Happosai put up a minimal struggle though. Ranma let him<br/>continue to watch until all the girls had left the room.<p>The pair jumped down from the ceiling and looked at each other for<br/>a moment. "Well, that was fun!" said Ranma.<p>"I think that's enough for today though," said Happosai as he<br/>patted his bag of undies. "I've got to go sort through my new panties<br/>and add to my collection!"<p>"What do you do with doubles?" asked Ranma as he appeared to think<br/>about it for a moment. "I mean, you must have more than one of a few<br/>pair."<p>"Heh. How little you know boy! Each silky darling is a new<br/>adventure in itself!"<p>"Hey. Whatever floats your boat old man!" replied the boy with a<br/>shrug.<p>The door in front of them started to open and Happosai and Ranma<br/>froze.<p>The team had returned back into the locker with the coach for an<br/>after game meeting. Thinking quickly, Ranma hooked his foot under<br/>Happosai and kicked him out the window. The old man yelped in<br/>surprise, but landed on his feet.<p>Ranma found himself backing away as they entered the room. There<br/>was no way he'd make it to the window himself. He spotted an unopened<br/>locker behind himself and quickly ducked inside.<p>"What was that noise?" asked one of the girls as she noticed the<br/>door move. "Hey! There's someone in there!"<p>There was a collective screech.<p>Ranma closed his eyes and slumped down against the door. A group<br/>of angry girls opened the door and he fell forward onto the ground,<br/>appearing to be out cold.<p>"Eek! Pervert!" cried one of the girls angrily.<p>"He's all beat up!" pointed out one of the other girls.<p>"Hey! I know that guy!" said another one of the girls.<p>"Isn't that the guy Akane's trying to kill?"<p>"Yeah! Ranma Saotome! He's dangerous!" squealed someone.<p>"Step aside!" growled the coach. She wasn't exactly a beautiful<br/>woman, but she wasn't mannish either. She had short cut gray hair and<br/>a somewhat stocky build to her. She glared down at the fallen boy for<br/>a moment and picked him up by the back of his shirt. "You'd better<br/>have a good reason for being here."<p>Ranma was glaring at her in what appeared to be disgust. "Stupid<br/>old man."<p>Everyone blinked at this.<p>"Why are you in here?" snapped the coach.<p>"I was fightin some old guy who was robbing the place. He got<br/>lucky and shoved me in there last I remember," snorted Ranma as he<br/>returned her harsh glare.<p>"How did you know he was here?" snapped one of the girls.<p>"I followed him, he's been stealin panties and stuff," replied the<br/>boy calmly. "Can I go now? I hurt all over."<p>Remarkably, his story flew. He looked beat up enough from the last<br/>mob of girls he'd run into.<p>The coach put him down and stepped aside with a confused frown. He<br/>strolled out of the room unobstructed and walked out the door. As soon<br/>as he was outside, he pushed himself against the wall with is eyes<br/>wide and gasped as he clutched his chest. "Man, that was close!"<p>"Ranma! You're alive!" cried Happosai as he bounced over to the<br/>boy. "Good job!"<p>The boy nodded and started to stagger away. "Come on, let's get<br/>out of here!"<p>Happosai bounced away cheerfully.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma stared at Akane as she frowned at him and punched again.<br/>"Come on you jerk!"<p>"I'm a bit out of it today, sorry Akane," he replied with a small<br/>shrug. "I told you I'd be training with that old man today."<p>Akane frowned at this and pushed her attack a bit harder. Ranma<br/>grabbed her chest almost lazily, but a bit slower than normal as he<br/>shoved her back, making sure to get a good squeeze in while he did it.<br/>"You're still rough with those punches Akane."<p>"Damn," grumbled the girl as she fell on her rear and rubbed at<br/>her breast in irritation. "I'll beat you yet!"<p>"Yeah, yeah. That's enough for tonight though. Go home and get<br/>some rest," replied the boy as he turned away from her.<p>She snorted in disgust and relaxed her stance. He walked towards<br/>the house and opened the door. Akane was right behind him, she was<br/>scowling angrily and turned her head away from him as she walked<br/>directly behind him.<p>"I had no idea you were still living here Mrs. Saotome! It's so<br/>nice to see you again!" said a feminine voice from inside. "I checked<br/>with the school, but it seems no one was there when I arrived. I was a<br/>little too late."<p>"That's all right, I'm sure my family will be happy to hear you're<br/>back in town dear!" said Nodoka.<p>Ranma had frozen in mid step and Akane almost walked into his<br/>back. "Huh?"<p>"It can't be!" muttered the boy with an unreadable gaze on his<br/>face.<p>"What the hell?" grumbled Akane irritably.<p>"Oh Ranma! Finished training?" said his mother as she stood up to<br/>greet him.<p>"Ranma!" cried the woman who stood up next to the boy's mother<br/>with a smile on her face. "Wow! You've grown so much!"<p>"Midori..." muttered Ranma as he stared at her.<p>"Yeah! Nice to see you too! How have you been? It's been a long<br/>time, Ranma. You never came to visit."<p>Akane looked at the woman for a moment. She had her hair pulled up<br/>in a tight bun on top of her head and was dressed in a business suit.<br/>"Who?"<p>"Who is this girl?" asked Midori cheerfully.<p>"That's Akane. She's my son's student!" said Nodoka cheerfully.<p>Ranma had said nothing and merely stared at the girl.<p>"Well, aren't you going to say anything?" replied the girl as she<br/>walked over to him and touched his chest with her fingers lightly.<br/>"It's been so long handsome."<p>Ranma looked down at her hand and then back up at her face again.<br/>"<br/>HHHHHHH!"<p>Akane blinked as the boy turned away and ran into the yard at a<br/>full sprint. He bounced over the wall and vanished into the streets of<br/>Nerima.<p>"What the hell?" She stared at the girl for a moment in confusion.<p>"He still likes me!" said Midori cheerfully.<p>"Such a shy son I have," commented Nodoka to herself.<p>Not sure of what else to say, Akane blinked and turned towards the<br/>door. "I'll see you tomorrow night Auntie."<p>Nodoka nodded and smiled at her. "Tommorow then Akane."<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma was huddled inside a cement pipe in a construction yard<br/>mumbling to himself in horror. "Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!" His heart<br/>was racing and he was gasping badly. "She's found me!"<p>++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...
