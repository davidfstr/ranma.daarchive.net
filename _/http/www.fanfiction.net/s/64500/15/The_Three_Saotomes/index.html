</div>The Three Saotomes.<p>Part 15<p>The final solution?<p>++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo had been having more than a bad day. It had been a bad month. Things were getting worse from her point of view.<p>Ranma still 'trained' her every morning and every afternoon. The boy was down right relentless, and there wasn't a thing she could do to stop him. Matin, her own student, had learned all she could teach him really. His skill level was above her own, even before that. She had done nothing more than show him a few counters, and favorite moves of the elder Saotome boy.<p>Now though, Ranma and Genryu, had both actually refused to eat the meal she had worked so hard on. "You jerks!" snapped the girl.<p>"Calm down Akane," replied the elder boy as he caught her hand as she attempted to deck him. "I don't see the rest of your family being any braver than I am. Why don't you pick on them?"<p>Akane slowly turned to see the meal was completely untouched, her family was giving Ranma unpleasant glares. Even Kasumi looked slightly annoyed with him.<p>"All of you?" cried the girl in shock.<p>"Come on Akane, you try at cooking as hard as you do at martial arts. That's why you keep screwing things up," said Ranma with a smirk on his face.<p>"What's that supposed to mean?" snapped the girl.<p>"Only that you're impatient, and don't really pay attention to what you're doing," replied the boy curtly.<p>Akane's arms blurred as she attacked him viciously for his comments. He lazily moved one arm and deflected every punch with his chopsticks. "Really, Akane. You don't take criticism very well do you?"<p>The girl paused and looked at him in shock. "What?"<p>"Here I am, taking my time, trying to help you out. And this is how you thank me?"<p>Akane stepped back with a horrified realization crossing her face. "He-he's right!"<p>"Yes, you really are quite an ungrateful tomboy, uncute, completely sexless, and just down right rude," finished the older boy with a sagely nod.<p>"That does it! Die!" screamed Akane as she attempted to tackle him to the ground. The Tendo's floor received a rather large hole for her efforts, and Ranma skillfully hopped out into the yard again.<p>Nabiki sighed as she picked up one of the pickles from the meal Kasumi had made, as the elder girl quietly got rid of the unidentifiable mess Akane had created. "You know. He's trying to make her angry."<p>"Gee, you think?" deadpanned Genryu lazily as he started to eat as well.<p>"Fools, you don't realize that Ranma has sacrificed his own meal, so that he could distract her? Now we can get rid of that horrible thing and eat in peace! Without fear! Oh my son! You have made me so proud!" cried Genma with tears in his eyes.<p>"Now Saotome, let's not over do it," said Soun nervously as he glanced at the two fighting teens in his yard. He had trouble pulling his eyes away from the new hole in his home as well.<p>"Like Ranma would do something like that. I think he just enjoys getting a rise out of her," commented Nabiki. "A little too much if you ask me."<p>"You said it, I don't think I've ever seen anyone he enjoys torturing more than her," commented Genryu.<p>"Actually, I believe Mr. Saotome," said Kasumi cheerfully.<p>Everyone stopped eating and looked at her.<p>"Y-you do?" said Genma in shock.<p>"Oh, yes! Ranma might seem a little rough, but he always tries to do what's best for everyone," said the girl cheerfully.<p>"You know. I never really thought about it, but she's right," commented Genryu as he started eating again.<p>Nabiki paused and looked out in the yard at the pair for a moment, before shrugging her shoulders and going back to her meal.<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma smirked as he landed across from the koi pond. Akane stood opposite him huffing with exhaustion. It was early morning and the day had just begun.<p>"Come on slow poke, you can keep up better than that," said Ranma with a smirk.<p>Akane growled and charged at him again, taking to the air the collided just above the small pond. After a moment they separated and landed lightly opposite one another.<p>Ranma turned and smirked at her lightly. "Well, not bad."<p>"Really? I thought so too," said Akane coldly as she slowly turned her head.<p>Ranma paused and frowned slightly. A small, familiar sensation tickled his cheek. He reached up slowly and wiped the trickle of blood away. "Hmm."<p>"Heh, I've got you now," said Akane as she stood proudly in a battle ready stance.<p>Ranma merely smirked and chuckled to himself at the display. "Hardly, my little brother would still wipe the floor with you in a real fight Akane. It looks like you're ready for the next level though."<p>Akane's smug look vanished in an instant. "What?"<p>"Come on!" snapped Ranma coldly. He actually took up a battle stance against her this time. "Show me what you can really do, Akane."<p>"You've been holding out on me?" said the girl in shock.<p>"Of course I have, after all, you have to learn the basics first, right?"<p>"Akane! Ranma! Breakfast!" called Kasumi from the house.<p>"Right! Come on, we've got other things to do right now," said the boy with a friendly smile as he walked into the house.<p>Akane simply stood in the yard staring at the ground. She wasn't sure what to say or do at the moment. "Basics?" Ranma's tone was enough to convince her that he wasn't kidding around with her this time. "Damn." She slowly started towards the porch.<p>++++++++++<p>Furinkan High was strangely silent as they approached. Kuno stood out in the open with his bokuten resting against the wall beside him.<p>Ranma and Genryu walked up to him. "Hey Kuno, what's up?" said the younger boy.<p>"You shall see soon enough, Saotome," replied the boy quietly.<p>"Well, I wonder who it could be today?" said Ranma with a confident smirk as he cracked his knuckles in anticipation.<p>"Hello," said Matin as he noticed them entering the school grounds through the gates. He was standing in the middle of the court, wearing a long black coat over his uniform. The familiar shine of metal was visible over his right shoulder.<p>Akane was standing against the tree near the center of the schoolyard. She was also strangely silent. There was a dark cloud cover in the sky above, and a cold wind blew from the west. As of yet, it was still completely dry though.<p>"Are you ready to try again?" said Ranma coolly as he approached the boy.<p>"More than ready Saotome, however, I have a proposition for you," said the boy coldly. "I'm sure you'll be interested."<p>Ranma paused, a paper fluttered in the wind and landed against his leg. He paused and glanced down at it for a moment, before plucking it off of his leg.<p>"What's going on?" said the boy as he narrowed his eyes suddenly, after looking at the page for a moment.<p>"You should have told me there were other interested parties. There's too many of us after you. Not everyone's honor will be satisfied," said Matin coldly.<p>Ranma tensed up as Xianghua and Tofu appeared along side the boy. Both of them had hard looks on their faces.<p>"What the hell is this? Ganging up on me?" snorted Ranma coldly. A chill went down his spine as thunder began to rumble in the distance.<p>"In this weather? No, I know better than that, remember?" said Xianghua coolly. Hatred burned in her eyes and in her voice as she said this.<p>Genryu took up a defensive position just to his older brother's right. Akane had said nothing so far, but had a surprised look on her face. It was obvious this was new to her.<p>"Well, well, you seem to be in a bit of a spot, Saotome," called a new voice from behind him.<p>"Taro? What the hell are you doing here?" said Ranma in confusion. "I thought you were around."<p>"Actually, I've been following her," the Chinese boy nodded towards Xianghua and smirked. "I've been wondering what she was doing here. It seems she wasn't lying. After all, here you are."<p>"Well, I suppose I should be grateful, but you've obviously got your own agenda," replied Ranma casually as Taro took up an offensive looking stance opposite Genryu.<p>"So, you've chosen your side have you?" snapped Xianghua.<p>"I owe him a favor," replied the Chinese boy with a small shrug.<p>Matin chuckled. "Now, now, calm down. Up for a little game Saotome?"<p>"What are you up to?" snapped Genryu angrily.<p>"We're going to hold a little tournament. You're welcome to participate, after all, the prize is you Saotome," replied the boy with his grin widening.<p>"So, you're going to try and settle the rights to my life. Is that it?" said Ranma coldly.<p>"Something like that, I wish I could say it was my idea. In truth, it was an old friend of yours," said Matin calmly.<p>"Who?" snapped Genryu.<p>"Ah, that would be telling," said Xianghua. "I learned about this yesterday, when he visited the clinic. He's been keeping an eye on you for a while now it seems."<p>Ranma snorted. "Hakama? He's the only one left who hasn't shown up yet. I'll bet he's hiding, because he knows what I'll do to him if I ever see his face again."<p>"Well, quite impressive. I didn't think you'd figure it out," said a new boy who seemed to melt from the shadows. He was a tall, Japanese boy of about nineteen. His clothing was an expensive suit. His hair was slicked back and a thin pair of glasses rested on his nose.<p>"Yikes! What a dream!" commented one of Akane's friends.<p>"Somehow, I doubt that," muttered Akane to herself as she eyed him curiously.<p>"You! How dare you show your face to me again!" snapped Ranma as he charged forward.<p>The boy chuckled and sidestepped the blow easily. Behind him, Ranma left a huge hole in the wall of the school. "I'll break you!" snapped the angry Saotome as he spun around in a vicious kick.<p>"You'll get your chance," said the boy as he performed an acrobatic back flip and landed lightly a few yards away. "Just not now."<p>"I don't know. I say we let him kill you. That's just one less obstacle in my way," snorted Xianghua coldly.<p>"Now, let's be civil about this," said Hakama calmly.<p>"He looks like more than he is, he's nothing but a gymnast, not a martial artist. He's good at dodging, but his blows feel like those of a three year old," said Ranma with a small chuckle.<p>"A three year old good enough to leave scars on a man like you?" replied Hakama coldly.<p>"I'll pay you back ten times for every one of them," replied Ranma coldly.<p>Akane looked at the scene in shock. Genryu didn't appear to be too happy with this boy either, but kept his temper in check.<p>"So. How long have you been here?" snapped Ranma with a sudden calm coming over him.<p>"About four days now. Mr. No Name here, was planning on challenging you today. I learned from him about the others. I met him on the way here, and asked about you. One thing led to another, you know how these things go." Hakama jerked his thumb towards Matin as he said this.<p>"Even if you somehow win, you won't beat me," snapped Ranma coldly. "These fighters will tear you apart."<p>"As you say, I am not interested in such things. I get you when we're through with you," replied the boy calmly.<p>"So, what's this tournament?" said Ranma as he seemed to lose interest suddenly.<p>"Anyone who wishes may enter, including you. The swordsman over there has agreed, Miss Saotome as well." He gave a small nod to Xianghua, who growled at him angrily. "The nameless warrior as well. I'm sure we can pick up a few more along the way."<p>"Sound's interesting," said yet another voice from the top of the wall above the school.<p>"Who the?" snapped Genryu as he turned to face the newcomer.<p>The figure was mostly obscured by the shadows, lightning flashed from above. The long hair and shadowy presence of a familiar weapon was enough to tell Ranma who it was. "Ukyo Kuonji," he muttered. "Of all the bad timing..."<p>"I'm assuming Genryu will fight as well of course?" she asked as she jumped down.<p>"Ucchan?" muttered the younger boy as he took a step forward. Ranma put his arm in front of him and shook his head at the boy. The younger boy looked at him in confusion and then back to the angry glare his childhood friend was giving him. "What's going on?"<p>"Tell you later," replied the older boy. "Well, you seem to have everything planned out don't you?"<p>"Of course. I'll have you yet Saotome. Forever this time," said Hakama coldly.<p>"If he survives," commented Xianghua coolly. "I don't see why we can't settle this right now."<p>"Patience my dear, revenge grows sweeter with time, it's like a fine wine that way," said Hakama in reply.<p>"Who the heck is this guy?" said Nabiki from the sidelines as she eyed the new rival carefully. "My, you have been busy Saotome."<p>"I guess we're all for it then," said Ranma with a smirk on his face. Genryu frowned at his posturing. The older boy was covered in a cold sweat, and had become almost as pale as a ghost. He noticed his older brother's eyes kept flicking upward, towards the brewing storm above.<p>"Let's hurry up, before Saotome passes out from his terror," snorted Hakama coldly.<p>"Don't confuse concern with fear," replied Xianghua. "He's worried about the storm, not us."<p>"An after effect of the curse I suppose," muttered Hakama coolly. He did not elaborate further, but caught a confused stare from Xianghua.<p>"He knows about his problem?" thought the woman for a moment before brushing it aside.<p>"Fitting, a wild horse always fears the storm. I should know," said the Hakama as he turned away from them and started to walk away.<p>"The tournament will be in two weeks. All interested parties should be there the day before. We'll see who's the strongest under heaven in the end."<p>"Stupid fanboy freak," muttered Ranma as he immediately recognized the set up the man had used.<p>Nabiki overheard him and arched her eyebrow. "I wonder what he meant by that?"<p>"See you around Saotome," grumbled Xianghua as she turned away with Tofu.<p>"Man, even the doctor is pissed at you Ranma," commented Genryu.<p>"That's right, we'll meet again Saito," snapped Matin. "Wait, that's not right... umm... Sarko? No, that's not it either..." he wandered away scratching his head as he tried to remember what the Chinese girl had called him.<p>Ukyo Kuonji leveled her hate filled glare at Genryu and pivoted around on top of the wall. "We'll definitely be seeing each other again, Genryu."<p>The young boy reached for her as she vanished over the wall. "Ucchan! Wait! Why..." He turned towards his brother and frowned. "You know something."<p>"Yes," said the boy in reply as he turned away. "Don't worry, we'll take care of that later. Fixing that problem should be easy."<p>"What problem?" snapped Genryu as he grabbed the older by his shirt and whirled him around.<p>"We'll talk about it later," he glanced towards Nabiki and Akane. "In private."<p>"Right," snorted Genryu in disgust as he released him.<p>Akane stared at the pair and said nothing.<p>"Well, say something," said Ranma as he moved towards her.<p>"Like what?" snapped the girl.<p>"I don't know, 'prepare to die?' Don't just stand there. Are you going to fight or not?" asked Ranma.<p>"Why would I fight for you?" snapped the girl angrily.<p>"Who said anything about for me? I know you want your shot, almost as bad as they do. Plus, it'll be good training for you," said the boy with a shrug.<p>"I'll think about it," said the girl with a snort. She meant it too. She would be badly outclassed, and she knew it. Still, did she want to try? Just for a real shot at him?<p>"Akane, no one here is going to be holding back. You should know that. Not even me, when it comes down to it," said the boy as he turned away.<p>"Right," muttered the girl.<p>"It sounds interesting. I've got other fish to fry though. I may decide to go myself. It sounds like fun," said Taro as he walked up to the two Saotome brothers.<p>"I hope to see you there," said Genryu with a smirk.<p>"Do what you want Taro. You know I won't stop you," said Ranma as he grabbed the boy's shoulder as he passed him.<p>"I'll see if I can clear it up," snorted the Chinese boy as he started off in the same direction.<p>"Where are you going?" said Akane as she noticed where they were going.<p>"To train. I'm not going to be caught off guard by this. Are you coming?" replied Ranma.<p>"It's almost two weeks away!" retorted the girl angrily.<p>"Yeah, not nearly enough time," said Genryu with a cheerful smile. It was easy to tell that he was worried behind it though.<p>Akane desperately wanted to tell them where to put their training. She opened her mouth to voice it and glanced back at the school again. Her brow furrowed with anger and she spun around. Silently following the men off the school grounds.<p>Nabiki ran up behind her as she reached the gates. "Akane! Be careful, all right?"<p>The younger girl paused and nodded without turning back. Then she started forward again.<p>"Akane Tendo. I shall protect you at this competition," said Kuno under his breath as he watched her go. He stood upright from leaning on the outer wall, and walked towards his home. In his hand was the flier, 'Strongest Under the Heavens', was written across the top in giant kanji.<p>+++++++++++<p>Taro turned towards his two companions and smiled as he stopped in the middle of the road. "It seems you two have a shadow."<p>"Don't worry about it," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>Taro nodded and looked back at Akane again. "Cute one. Oh well, this is where we part ways boys. I use the term loosely," he glanced at Genryu for a moment and smirked.<p>"Sure thing, Pantyhose," retorted the boy quietly.<p>"Shut yer trap," said Taro with a hint of anger flashing in his eyes.<p>"Did you ever find that guy?" asked Ranma.<p>"No. Thought he might be here though. I've run out of options. He's the last name on the list," said the boy with his fist clenched in anger.<p>"Well good luck," said Ranma as he started walking again. Akane was still a fair distance away from them, waiting patiently for them to part ways.<p>"I'll see you in two weeks Ranma," said Taro as he turned down the street.<p>Ranma turned towards Genryu and frowned slightly. "Let's hurry up and beat this storm. We don't have much time."<p>"Right," agreed the younger boy. They both broke into a jog and headed towards the dojo.<p>++++++++++++<p>On the shores of China, a dark figure stood staring out into the ocean. The black aura that surrounded him and the bodies that lay at his feet in the sand were a testament of his power. "So. I must return to the place of my birth at last."<p>He watched the sun sink into the distance, into the mountains of China. Then, he turned and stepped into the water. It hissed and bubbled as it came into contact with his aura. Already, a few small fish floated to the surface dead in front of him. "Soon I shall become complete. Then, I shall rule as a god once again!" Finally, the black figure's helmet sank beneath the waves, the dead sea life floating onto the shore and the dead behind him the only indication of his presence left behind.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Shampoo stood on a nearby cliff, watching the scene intently. The spear in her hands glowed with power as she watched the demon vanish.<p>"Great Grandmother must hear of this," she said to herself. "I must follow. I will not be defeated by this monster! I shall hunt him to the ends of the Earth if necessary!"<p>++++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo walked into her home after the school day had ended. It was much quieter there than she ever remembered it being. Only the quiet buzz of anticipation could be heard throughout the normally busy rumors. No talking of boyfriends and girlfriends cheating, or who was going out with who, or even who liked who. She smelled a mint brewing.<p>"So, you're here," said Ranma as he met her in the hallway.<p>She paused in surprise. She had expected him, his brother, and her sister to be in the dojo. "Yes. Do you have a minute? I've got a few questions."<p>"Always thinking of the next score?" he replied in amusement.<p>"You know I can't pass this up," replied the girl curtly.<p>"Come on then. I've got a few stories to tell then," said Ranma as he rolled his eyes. "Everyone is so impatient today."<p>"What?" said the girl in confusion.<p>Akane walked up behind him and frowned. "She's here now. Are you happy? Tell us what the hell is going on! Who the hell are those people? What did you do to them? How on earth did you get Dr. Tofu mad at you?"<p>Ranma chuckled slightly at the barrage, but motioned for them to follow. Soun, Genma, and the rest of their families were sitting around the table.<p>"To start off. I've got no idea why Tofu's mad at me. It might have something to do with Xianghua. She's been staying with him I understand."<p>"I really thought better of him than that," commented Kasumi.<p>"What they do is their own business," said Ranma a little too sharply.<p>"What about that Hakama guy? Who's he?" asked Nabiki.<p>"A complete psycho. He's rich, powerful, and completely insane. Incidentally, he's also a bit of an obsessive anime fan. That's where he got the name for the tournament. 'Strongest Under the Heavens'. It's from old Dragon Ball manga." Ranma frowned deeply as he said this. "That's not how I know him though. We met because of his other obsession."<p>"Which is?" pried Nabiki.<p>"It's a long involved story," he raised his eyebrow at her annoyed stare and smiled. "Relax, I'm going to tell it to all of you right now. I guess I can fill you in on Taro as well, while I'm at it."<p>"What about, Ucchan?" snapped Genryu.<p>"Later, in private," replied Ranma carefully.<p>"Ucchan?" said Genma as he stared at the two boys in shock.<p>"She showed up today as well," said Ranma with a small nod.<p>The oldest Saotome looked worried for a moment.<p>"Relax old man. I'll take care of that," said Ranma coolly.<p>Genma started to open his mouth, but a look from his oldest son quieted him down easily.<p>"I guess I better finally fess up on Xianghua to you girls. The story is important to me and Taro meeting."<p>Ranma started to tell his story...<p>++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: More story time! Yay!<p>C&amp;C to:<p>The tournament will not happen for about four or five parts yet. I've still got a few things to fit in before then. Originally, this was going to be the big fight between Ranma and Matin, but I didn't want to have Ranma fighting all his old enemies, one at a time, while Wai Mei Kai was wandering around China looking for him.<p>So, I decided to short cut a little bit, and used a villain mentioned early on in the series. I'll have more fun that way anyway.<p>Hakama's name was mentioned in the first list of villains Xianghua gave, for those of you who pay attention to these things. Besides, I want this to be long, but not -that- long. It would have taken about twenty five or thirty chapters to get everybody in, plus in between stuff. Ranma and family have been living with the Tendo's about six months at this point. I've still got a lot to go, even after this tournament thing is over.<p>
