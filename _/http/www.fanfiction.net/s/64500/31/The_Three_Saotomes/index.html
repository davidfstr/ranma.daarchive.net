</div>The Three Saotomes<p>Part 31<p>The flame of depression.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome woke up shivering. He wasn't sure why that was, or<br/>the reason he was so uncomfortable. He slowly opened his eyes to the<br/>sound of a gentle rain just outside. "Where?" he muttered as he<br/>noticed his dull gray surroundings. "I'm..."<p>He was sitting inside a cement pipe, and was basically stuck there<br/>until the rain let up.<p>"Shit," he grumbled as he shifted his position in order to make<br/>himself more comfortable. It was morning, and he was probably already<br/>late for class. "Might as well just skip today," he muttered under his<br/>breath.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>A limo pulled up to Furinkan high in the rain. The student body<br/>froze as a large man dressed in a black suit stepped out of the<br/>driver's seat and walked to the back door with an umbrella. He didn't<br/>bother opening it until he was standing in front of the door and<br/>pulled it open.<p>"Who?" stammered one of the girls near the front of the crowd. The<br/>boy next to her simply felt his jaw grow slack at the sight of what<br/>emerged. It was a stunning looking woman with her hair pulled into a<br/>tight bun and a professional looking business suit on. She smirked at<br/>the crowd and strolled towards the gates.<p>Tatewaki Kuno let out a quiet gasp as he staggered back at the<br/>sight of her.<p>She simply walked forward with her escort holding the umbrella<br/>over her head at her side towards the building.<p>Akane narrowed her eyes at the girl. "Hey. It's that Midori girl."<p>One of her friends turned her head towards her and whispered.<br/>"What? You know her? Who is she?"<p>"I don't know her, she's a friend of Ranma's. I met her yesterday<br/>when I was training. He seems scared of her."<p>"Ranma? Afraid of someone?" muttered the girl in shock.<p>"Yeah," agreed Akane quietly. The girl had been at the fight,<br/>along with a good portion of the students in the crowd. Those that<br/>heard her quickly spread the word around and within moments there<br/>where whispers running through the crowd.<p>Midori smirked to herself at the sound of it. "Talking about me<br/>already?"<p>"You made quite an entrance," said the stone-faced bodyguard<br/>calmly.<p>"So it seems, I do wonder where dear Ranma is though, I don't see<br/>him in the crowd."<p>"Perhaps he is inside?" asked the man calmly.<p>"Come, we'll ask some of the students first." She turned towards<br/>the crowd and the man with her gave a slight frown at this.<p>A sound caught her attention though; she cocked her head and<br/>peered at the newcomer who rushed through the gates. It was a familiar<br/>looking boy with an umbrella in his hand.<p>"Jeez Ucchan, I would have been all right," muttered Genryu<br/>Saotome as he looked at his wife in irritation.<p>"I don't need you catching cold. Besides, wouldn't you rather be a<br/>man anyway?" said the boy who was standing next to him with a slightly<br/>irritated frown. He had an umbrella of her own and looked like she was<br/>growing irritated with the conversation.<p>"I know, it's just that we were almost late today. We could have<br/>bought these later, I could live with it until we got here," said the<br/>boy with a small sigh.<p>Midori narrowed her eyes slightly, but her cheerful smile quickly<br/>returned. "Well, hello there. It's been a while since I've seen you<br/>little brother."<p>Genryu froze in his tracks and stared at her.<p>"L-little brother?" muttered Kuno as he began to edge away from<br/>the scene a little more.<p>Midori blinked at the sound of the voice that had floated over the<br/>silent crowd. "Tachi?"<p>Kuno muttered a silent curse under his breath and tensed his body<br/>suddenly. Everyone was looking at him and he froze. "It...has been a<br/>while Midori," he said with a nod.<p>"Oh! It is you! Fancy meeting you here!" cried the girl.<p>"M-m-m-" stammered Genryu with a horrified looking expression on<br/>his face.<p>Ukyo promptly slapped him on the back of his head. "Spit it out<br/>will ya?"<p>"Midori! Oh shit! I gotta warn..." he trailed off as he found his<br/>path blocked by his wife. "Um..."<p>"You know her?" said the chef as she stared at the girl for a<br/>moment.<p>"Um, kinda yeah..." said the boy nervously. He was shaking so<br/>badly that he looked like he was about to drop his umbrella.<p>Ukyo didn't like the look of this. She turned towards the new girl<br/>and frowned. "Who are you? How do you know my husband?"<p>The girl blinked at this. "Husband?" She peered closer at the girl<br/>and realized that she was indeed female. "Oh! Oh my! How terribly rude<br/>of me! You must be my future sister in law! I am Midori Tachibana. It<br/>is a pleasure to meet you."<p>"Future..." muttered Ukyo as she stared at the girl.<p>"Sister in law?" muttered Akane as she moved up next to the girl.<p>"Yes, I am Ranma Saotome's fiancee," said the girl with a heavy<br/>blush on her face.<p>"Saotome! It could not be! I would never wish such a fate upon my<br/>most hated rival!" cried Kuno out loud.<p>Midori turned slowly and looked at him. "Pardon me?" she said<br/>cheerfully.<p>Kuno stared at her, a shocked and horrified expression on his face<br/>as he realized that he had spoken out loud. "'Twas a mere slip of the<br/>tongue. Ranma Saotome, my dear friend and comrade in arms, is most<br/>fortunate to have such a lovely bride. The cur I speak of, would never<br/>have such fortune fall upon him!"<p>The student body blinked in unison. Tatewaki Kuno had just called<br/>the man who had broken his family sword a 'dear friend'.<p>"How sweet!" said Midori cheerfully as she pinched his cheek and<br/>jerked it a little. She released him and Kuno found himself rubbing<br/>the spot in irritation.<p>"You're Ranma's fiancee?" said Akane as she stared at the girl.<p>"Yes," said Midori cheerfully.<p>"Oh. Nice to meet you I suppose," she said with a simple shrug.<br/>She started walking towards the school without much interest in what<br/>was going on any longer.<p>"Hold, don't I know you?" said Midori.<p>Genryu stepped in before Akane could respond, much to her<br/>annoyance. "She's from the sister school to our own. Ranma's teaching<br/>her some of the more advanced forms."<p>"Oh?" said Midori with her eyebrow arching slightly. "Yes, you<br/>were there that day I met with him in his home."<p>"That's right," said Akane coldly. "When he ran away from you."<p>Midori barely managed to keep her eye from twitching. "He's just a<br/>little shy."<p>"I doubt that very much," muttered Kuno.<p>"What was that?" said Midori as she faced him again.<p>"Ranma Saotome is anything but shy, it is no doubt he wished to be<br/>presentable for his future wife. Meeting one's future spouse is<br/>something one does not do after such an arduous workout," said Kuno<br/>quickly.<p>"Oh. I suppose you're right," said the girl. "I probably should<br/>have called first, but I couldn't wait to meet him again! It had been<br/>so long!"<p>"More like you didn't want to give him the chance to escape,"<br/>grumbled Genryu irritably.<p>Ukyo stared at him for a moment, but the girl didn't seem to<br/>notice his words. "What's going on here?" she whispered harshly.<p>"Later," replied Genryu quietly.<p>Ukyo nodded with a serious frown on her face.<p>"Where is my darling Ranma anyway? I don't see him here," she said<br/>as she looked around the campus for a moment.<p>Various mutters about how lucky Ranma Saotome was could be heard<br/>in the crowd as the act gave everyone a good look at her.<p>"Saotome is not present today," said Kuno calmly. "Perhaps he is<br/>late."<p>"He's not here?" said Genryu in confusion.<p>"No, Saotome has not yet set foot upon these hallowed grounds,"<br/>said Kuno with a serious nod.<p>"Well, I suppose I shall catch him another time," said Midori as<br/>she turned back towards her car. The man followed her, keeping the<br/>umbrella over her head as he did so with practiced ease.<p>Kuno frowned as she left them standing there. "Midori Tachibana?<br/>Ranma Saotome, I shall pray for your very soul."<p>"You know her?" said Genryu as he stared at the boy.<p>"Indeed, we attended the same junior high school," said Kuno<br/>seriously. "Nabiki Tendo will know of her as well. She is not one that<br/>anyone should tread on. She is dangerous." The boy rubbed at his<br/>shoulder absently for a moment with a frown on his face.<p>"Ucchan, I've got to go. I've got to find Ranma and warn him about<br/>this," said Genryu seriously as he faced his wife.<p>"He already knows," said Akane as she moved back into the group.<br/>"She showed up last night when I was there for my training."<p>Genryu nodded at this. "Still, he's going to need my help."<p>"Wait! What the hell is going on here? Who the hell is that?" said<br/>Ukyo irritably.<p>"We'll meet at the restaurant tonight, I'll explain everything<br/>then," said Genryu as he gave her a serious nod.<p>Ukyo looked uncertain about this for a moment, but finally nodded.<br/>"All right. You'd better show up Genryu."<p>The boy nodded and turned towards the gates.<p>Akane frowned at this and snorted.<p>Kuno merely stood up straight and turned away.<p>"Are you two going to show up as well?" asked Ukyo.<p>"Ranma can deal with his own problems," said Akane coldly.<p>"I would not involve myself with anything having to do with that<br/>woman. I feel Saotome's pain, but I am not his ally," agreed Kuno<br/>stoically.<p>"Fine," said Ukyo with a small shrug.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>A short distance away...<p>Ryoga Hibiki stared out over the rooftops of Tokyo with a frown on<br/>his face. "So, I'll be there soon." He clenched his fist at his side<br/>and started off with the same dead look in his eyes. "Genryu Saotome,<br/>I cannot defeat you, but I can take you with me. It is all I can hope<br/>for."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma rubbed at his head as he sat in thought on top of the cement<br/>pipe that had been his prison not even an hour before. The rain had<br/>stopped and he was free to go, but instead he merely sat and<br/>contemplated his situation. "Damn. I knew she'd find me sooner or<br/>later. This really sucks, I don't have a clue what to do about her. I<br/>can't piss her off, there's no way I'm gonna marry her. Pop might<br/>actually be of some use in this, but I doubt it." His frown deepened<br/>at the thought of it.<p>"Genryu should be relatively safe, he's not staying with me<br/>anymore."<p>With a short nod he stood up and stared forward towards the<br/>street. "I guess this is my problem. I'd better find a way to deal<br/>with it fast." He jumped down off his perch and started walking.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Midori smirked as she stood in the rain watching the Tendo dojo.<br/>She chuckled silently as she simply stared at the gates for a time and<br/>did nothing. "So, this is where Ranma was staying."<p>"Yes, he recently moved back in with his mother due to an injury,"<br/>said her bodyguard calmly. "According to our reports, it is some kind<br/>of heart condition."<p>The girl frowned slightly at this. "Pardon?"<p>"Ranma Saotome, has a weak heart," replied the man calmly.<p>"That isn't good," said Midori as she scowled at him.<p>"There is little we can do about this situation," replied the man<br/>calmly. "Someone like him, is not a fitting heir to the Tachibana<br/>family fortune."<p>Midori's hand moved like a snake as she slapped him across his<br/>face. "That is for me alone to decide!" Her voice was a hateful hiss<br/>as she glared at him with a barely checked fury. "Ranma Saotome is<br/>mine! I shall do as I please, he is the one I have chosen!"<p>The man said nothing and merely nodded at her.<p>"See that your tongue does not slip again!"<p>"This place has no real interest to us," said the man as he<br/>quickly changed the object of the conversation.<p>"Perhaps not," said Midori calmly. "Still, it is possible that<br/>this Tendo girl wishes to take my love away from me. I have heard that<br/>she visits him on an almost daily basis."<p>"Her reasons are sound," replied the man simply. "The Tendo family<br/>and Saotome family do have a rather long personal history."<p>"That worries me even more," growled Midori. "I'll deal with it<br/>myself."<p>"That is not wise," replied the man calmly.<p>"I hate having others do my work for me," she said quietly. "I'll<br/>deal with this, and soon nothing will stand between me and Ranma."<p>"Very well," said the man calmly as he waited patiently for her to<br/>finish staring.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma sat in his home with a scowl on his face as he sipped at his<br/>tea.<p>His mother sat across from him with a cheerful smile on her face.<br/>"Well, that was quite exciting!"<p>"Midori?" he muttered irritably.<p>"Yes, I haven't seen her in years. It was some time ago that her<br/>family moved away. About a year after you left actually."<p>Ranma merely nodded and frowned. "Why would she show back up after<br/>all this time though? It was bad enough when we were little."<p>"Oh Ranma. She's your childhood sweetheart, don't be that way,"<br/>said his mother with a blush on her face.<p>"Did you have anything to do with this?" he muttered with a heavy<br/>sigh.<p>"No. I wish I had thought of it sooner. She could be good for<br/>you," said the woman with a wistful smile.<p>"Don't even think it. I'd rather marry that student of mine."<p>Nodoka blinked. "Ranma?"<p>"Nevermind. I forgot who I was talking too. It was meant to show<br/>how much I disagree with that idea."<p>"Midori is a sweet girl though," pointed out Nodoka.<p>"Midori burned off my hair when I was five mother," replied the<br/>boy calmly. "That little pyromaniac, I'd never marry her."<p>"Ranma! She's grown up! You don't really think..."<p>"Mother, Midori Tachibana is the one girl my father has refused to<br/>engage me too in his entire life. She's rich, and that's saying a lot<br/>concerning Genma Saotome."<p>"He's not still upset about that is he?" muttered the woman as she<br/>blinked.<p>"He never grew his hair back mother. I'd say he's still a bit<br/>bitter," was her son's reply.<p>"It's true, she was a rather active child..." muttered Nodoka.<p>"She was a psychotic firebug, she nearly killed me more than once,<br/>and decided that I should be in love with her somewhere along the<br/>line. I never agreed, please don't call her my 'childhood<br/>sweetheart'."<p>"I'm sure she's changed," muttered Nodoka with a blush forming on<br/>her face.<p>"It's obvious she's still fixated on me, it's been ten years,"<br/>replied the boy irritably. "I was hoping she'd forget about me."<p>Nodoka frowned at this slightly. She didn't quite understand why<br/>her son was so worried about the girl. She seemed nice enough after<br/>all, she was pretty, she was rich, her family was in excellent<br/>standing, and she seemed very interested in him.<p>Ranma found himself wondering if his mother even remembered all<br/>the times she'd tried to kill Genryu for 'getting between them'.<br/>"Probably not," he muttered under his breath as he put his head down<br/>on the table and stared at her for a moment.<p>She smiled at him in a motherly fashion and stood up. "Well, I<br/>suppose it's up to you my son. I've got some work to do around here<br/>today."<p>"Yeah," he muttered as she left him there.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Genryu was walking along the fence towards his mother's home. He<br/>gave a small sigh and kept his eyes forward. Midori was bad news, and<br/>he now that he knew that his brother already knew about her, much of<br/>the urgency was gone from the situation. Still, he wanted to find him<br/>and at least find out what they were going to do about it.<p>His trek forward was halted by a familiar voice. "Genryu Saotome,<br/>I've found you at last!"<p>The pigtailed boy stopped and turned. He looked somewhat confused<br/>by the boy standing behind him in travel clothes. "Ryoga? What the<br/>heck are you doing here?"<p>"I've come, for my final revenge, Saotome," replied the boy<br/>coldly. His voice was calm and oddly devoid of emotion.<p>"Revenge? What the heck have I done now?" grumbled the pigtailed<br/>boy.<p>"That's enough, just fight," said Ryoga in a dead tone.<p>"Not right now. I gotta find Ranma, he's in trouble," said Genryu<br/>as he turned away. "We can fight later."<p>"Heh. I'm not giving you a choice, Saotome," replied the lost boy<br/>as he jumped forward with his fist extended in a punch.<p>"Jeez, aren't you pushy?" snorted the boy as he dodged the blow<br/>easily.<p>"You won't take this lightly Saotome," growled Ryoga as he jumped<br/>back to avoid the kick that was meant to counter his strike.<p>"Come on," snorted Genryu lazily. "I ain't got all day."<p>"You've got your entire afterlife! Shishihokoudan!" Ryoga extended<br/>his palms forward and a ball of energy formed there. It expanded and<br/>Genryu went flying through the air. The pigtailed boy landed roughly<br/>against the chain link fence and bounced to the ground.<p>He stood up and stared at Ryoga in shock. "What the heck was<br/>that?"<p>"Do you like it, Saotome?" replied Ryoga with a cold frown on his<br/>face. "It's the force of your destruction!"<p>Genryu stepped back in a defensive stance. "It's like...a solid<br/>wave of air? How is he doing this?"<p>"Shishihokoudan!" cried Ryoga as he sent another of the blasts<br/>towards his opponent. Genryu grunted as he found himself unable to<br/>defend and took the full brunt of the attack.<p>"Damn!" he growled as he found himself flat on his back a few<br/>yards down the sidewalk. "I can't defend against that!"<p>"This is too easy," muttered Ryoga as his eyes fell a bit more. "I<br/>was hoping you'd give me more of a fight."<p>"I'll give you one you won't forget!" snapped Genryu as he jumped<br/>into the air towards his opponent.<p>Ryoga snorted and simply raised his palm. "Shishihokoudan," he<br/>whispered calmly.<p>Genryu was thrown back once again. He landed hard and pushed<br/>himself up with his arms. "Damn."<p>Ryoga simply stared at him. "You've got three days. I'd kill you<br/>now, but I'd rather do it with the perfected technique. Be ready."<p>"It's not perfected?" muttered Genryu as his eyes went wide. He<br/>was staring at the pavement with his jaw slack. "No way! Ryoga!<br/>I'll..." When he looked up, the lost boy was gone. "Damn."<p>He staggered to his feet and looked around at the empty street.<br/>"This can't be happening." He glanced towards his destination and<br/>frowned. "Ranma..."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo frowned as she stared at her television. She was<br/>wearing her dogi and still had a light sweat from her practice after<br/>school. Ranma hadn't been home, so she had returned and gone to the<br/>dojo instead. Apparently, by the time she had gotten there, he was<br/>still gone from when he'd run off the day before. Things around the<br/>dojo had been relatively quiet since the two Saotome brothers had<br/>left. Genma was still there, but he largely ignored her.<p>The only event worth speaking of was the arrival of the Dojo<br/>Destroyer a few weeks ago. She'd handled that rather easily, he was<br/>large, but not very skilled once he lost his signs.<p>Still, it wasn't all that bad having a period of peace and quiet.<br/>Kuno still bugged her, but he wasn't near as persistent as he had<br/>been. The crowd at school was long gone. What was left?<p>"I'm fuckin bored," she stated finally.<p>"Lovely Akane," said Nabiki as she peered over the cover of her<br/>magazine for a moment.<p>"Oh my!" muttered Kasumi as she blushed at the comment.<p>Soun and Genma both looked at her for a moment. They were both<br/>relatively used to her bursts of profanity as of late. Kasumi seemed<br/>to be the only one having a hard time with it.<p>The girl fell flat on her back and spread her arms. There wasn't<br/>really anything to do, maybe she could go pick a fight or something?<br/>Her brow furrowed at that, no doubt her father wouldn't approve of<br/>things like that. "I gotta find something to do."<p>"You could go out into the dojo," commented Soun.<p>"Quite so Tendo, one should never pass up the opportunity to<br/>better one's self," agreed Genma.<p>Akane snorted as she jumped to her feet. "Whatever," she turned<br/>towards the door and glanced at her older sister. "I should be back<br/>before dinner. I'm gonna go for a walk and get some practice in."<p>"Oh. All right then," said Kasumi cheerfully.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ryoga Hibiki was lost, that was normal. He didn't particularly<br/>care where he was at the moment though. He had three days before he<br/>had to be somewhere, and he knew he'd probably be late. He sighed as<br/>he strolled through the park and looked at everyone surrounding him.<br/>He was given a wide birth as he plodded forward.<p>His forward motion was halted by a familiar voice.<p>"Hey, I know you. Ryoga Hibiki right?"<p>He was somewhat surprised to hear anyone who recognized him by<br/>name. He was usually not in the same place long enough to get more<br/>than a passing glance from someone. "Yeah? Who wants to know?" he<br/>muttered.<p>It was the girl from the tournament. "You?"<p>Akane found herself smirking as she stared at him. "Yeah. Me."<p>"What do you want?" snorted Ryoga as he turned away from her. He<br/>had no real interest in the girl.<p>"A challenge," she replied simply. "Ranma's still gone, Genryu is<br/>probably busy with his wife, I've got no one to practice with."<p>"Why should I?" replied Ryoga calmly.<p>"Because, I challenge you," replied Akane as she stepped into a<br/>stance and smirked at him coldly.<p>Ryoga narrowed his eyes at the girl. "I went easy on you the last<br/>time we fought."<p>"Now you know better," she replied calmly.<p>Ryoga actually found himself giving a short snorting chuckle. "All<br/>right. If you really want to lose, I'll oblige you."<p>Akane narrowed her eyes at him. "I don't care if I win or not, all<br/>I care about, is becoming better than Ranma Saotome."<p>Ryoga was actually somewhat surprised by that statement, but he<br/>didn't show it. His icy cool hadn't broken yet, even when he had<br/>laughed it was still there. "Ranma? I'm only interested in his<br/>brother."<p>"Then we won't get in each other's way," replied Akane.<p>Ryoga merely nodded. "All right, it's a challenge then! Fight!"<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Shishihokoudan?" said Ranma as he stared at Genryu calmly. They were<br/>sitting at the table across from each other. The younger boy had a<br/>frown on his face.<p>"Yeah," said the younger boy as he frowned at this.<p>Ranma nodded. "I've heard of that technique."<p>Genryu actually looked surprised to hear it. "You have?"<p>"That's right. It's a chi blast, a dangerous one at that," said<br/>the older boy calmly.<p>"I can't think of a way to counter it. I've got to learn it!" said<br/>the younger boy as he clenched his fist.<p>"That's a bad idea," said Ranma calmly.<p>"What?" said Genryu as he stared at his brother.<p>"The Shishihokoudan, it's a dangerous technique, both to your<br/>opponent, and yourself. You'd be better off finding another way to<br/>counter it."<p>"I can't think of anything though," growled Genryu angrily. "I've<br/>got to figure out how he does it, and copy him. That's the only thing<br/>I can think of."<p>"Heh. If you really think so, go ahead. You'll never be able to<br/>match Ryoga Hibiki's power with the Shishihokoudan," replied the older<br/>boy calmly. "You just don't have what it takes for that move. Neither<br/>do I for that matter."<p>Genryu frowned at this. "So, you can't help me?"<p>Ranma smiled. "I never said that."<p>This caught the younger boy's attention in an instant. "What?"<p>"I know of the Shishihokoudan because I studied it at one time. I<br/>could never get it to work right. Then, I became as I am now, and it<br/>was rendered useless."<p>"You know the Shishihokoudan?" muttered the boy in shock. "You<br/>never showed me?"<p>"You weren't ready," replied Ranma calmly. "I think perhaps you<br/>are now. I'll share the secret of the Shishihokoudan with you, and a<br/>new technique that you will be able to use to counter it."<p>Genryu simply stared at his older brother for a moment. "I..."<p>"Heh. The Shishihokoudan's perfect form however, you'll never be<br/>able to overpower," replied Ranma as he glared at his brother firmly.<br/>"You'll have to defeat him, before he can use it."<p>The boy growled at this and hung his head. "If I can get through<br/>that defense, I know I can."<p>"Better be sure," replied Ranma calmly.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane screamed as she charged forward with her foot extended in a<br/>kick. The lost boy blocked with his arm, but she hooked her foot<br/>around his forearm and used it to launch herself into the air in a<br/>jumping crescent kick that slammed across his jaw and sent him flying<br/>back.<p>Ryoga staggered and wiped the corner of his mouth with the back of<br/>his wrist. "Not bad."<p>Akane was waiting calmly as she hopped in place. She took<br/>controlled breaths and simply watched him.<p>Ryoga didn't keep her waiting long as he charged and they clashed.<br/>His fist tore through the air and was blocked with a quick shove. She<br/>countered with a knee to his stomach, but that was blocked as well.<p>"I'm still holding back," said Ryoga calmly.<p>Akane growled in anger and jumped straight up into the air. The<br/>lost boy was caught off guard by the maneuver and found himself flat<br/>on his back as she kicked him in the face. "See what it gets you?"<p>Ryoga staggered to his feet. "Yeah. Guess I'll have to stop now."<p>The girl readied herself and tensed as he skid his foot across the<br/>ground creating a small cloud of dust as he set himself.<p>Ryoga growled and jumped forward. His speed increased suddenly and<br/>he punched at her with a few quick jabs. Akane kept up with him,<br/>barely. Her face was serious as she set her foot into the ground and<br/>pushed herself back suddenly, breaking off contact with the fighter.<p>"You're better than I'd thought," conceded Akane.<p>"You're much more improved than I had thought," said Ryoga<br/>respectfully. "It's still not enough though."<p>"We'll see," said Akane firmly.<p>"Not ready to give up yet?" snorted Ryoga.<p>"I'm still standing aren't I?" she cried as she charged forward.<p>Ryoga raised his palm. "No. Shishihokoudan."<p>Akane was no longer on her feet. The girl groaned painfully as she<br/>lay on her back for a moment. "What the?"<p>"You've improved a lot, I wish you luck," said Ryoga as he frowned<br/>at her. "You've still got a long way to go though."<p>Akane pushed herself onto her elbows and looked at the boy. "Wh?<br/>What was that?"<p>Ryoga smirked at her. "I'd tell you, but you're Ranma's pet<br/>project. I don't want him finding out about it before I can kill his<br/>brother."<p>Akane growled. "Tell me. I swear I won't tell them. I might be<br/>able to defeat Ranma with it!"<p>"Do you really think it will help? You saw what he can really do,"<br/>said Ryoga as he turned away from her.<p>"It's a start," she grumbled as she stood up and dusted off the<br/>pants on her dogi.<p>"I'd help you, but I've got training of my own to see to. That<br/>technique hasn't been perfected yet." The boy turned away again and<br/>started walking. "If you really want it, find it yourself. Everyone<br/>has heavy Ki, but perhaps you and I have more than most."<p>Akane blinked at this. "Heavy ki?" She stared down at her hands<br/>for a moment and then turned to watch the lost boy wander off. "A new<br/>technique?"<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Where are we going?" asked Ranma as his little brother pulled him<br/>down the street.<p>"Ucchan's," replied Genryu.<p>"Why?" asked the older boy.<p>"Cause I told Ukyo I'd bring ya," replied the boy as he tugged on<br/>the front of his brother's shirt. "C'mon."<p>"Why the hell does she want to see me?" muttered Ranma irritably.<p>"We're gonna talk about this whole Midori thing," said Genryu as<br/>he snorted at his brother's attitude.<p>The older boy's face fell. "Damn."<p>"Quit complaining, we can't ignore this until it goes away," said<br/>Genryu irritably.<p>"Why not?" grumbled Ranma. It was obvious that he knew why, but<br/>that didn't make dealing with it any easier.<p>"Just get in there," grumbled Genryu as he shoved his brother<br/>towards the restaurant that was now across the street.<p>"Fine," muttered the older boy.<p>Once inside, they found Ukyo doing what she normally was at that<br/>time of day. She was standing behind the grill with a few scattered<br/>customers sitting around her. "Hey."<p>"Yo!" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Sit," said Genryu as he pointed at one of the stools in front of<br/>the grill.<p>"Don't be so pushy," grumbled Ranma.<p>"Quit complaining!" snapped Genryu. "You sound like a girl!"<p>"At least I don't look like one," said Ranma calmly.<p>"What's that supposed to mean?" said Ukyo as she glared at her<br/>husband and leaned towards him over the grill.<p>"Relax, he was trying to use one of our father's insults to get to<br/>me," said Ranma as he pushed her back behind the grill.<p>"Right. Now, who's this Midori? What's she got on you?" said Ukyo<br/>as she frowned at the older boy.<p>"Midori used to live down the block from us when we were little.<br/>She decided that I would make the perfect husband for her when we were<br/>about six," said Ranma calmly.<p>"She's been chasing him for as long as I can remember. We had a<br/>few close calls when we were on our training trip, but we usually got<br/>away," agreed Genryu.<p>"So?" grumbled Ukyo.<p>"So? She's so psychotic, that my father refused an engagement from<br/>a rich and powerful family," said Ranma flatly.<p>"What's the big deal?" grumbled Ukyo.<p>"This is the same man, who engaged his other son to a cross<br/>dressing tomboy, for a Yattai," said Ranma as he glared at her.<p>Ukyo looked like one of the veins in her forehead was about to<br/>explode.<p>"Um, another example?" said Genryu nervously.<p>"Okay, how about the time he sold Genryu here for a bowl of rice<br/>and two fish, and a pickle?"<p>Ukyo stared at him, most of her anger was gone because of her<br/>surprise. "What?"<p>"He stole me back later," muttered Genryu sheepishly.<p>"Midori is dangerous. She tried to kill him a few times because<br/>she thought he was keeping us apart. Genma managed to whine his way<br/>out of it usually, but we don't like talking about that."<p>"So, you're scared of this girl?" muttered Ukyo as she stared at<br/>him.<p>"Terrified," said Genryu instantly.<p>Ranma blushed slightly at this. "I wouldn't go that far..."<p>"I would," replied Genryu calmly. "She burned off Pop's hair."<p>"Well, yeah..." said Ranma.<p>"Yours too," continued the younger boy.<p>"That's enough," said Ranma as he backhanded his brother in the<br/>face. The younger boy fell silent as he found himself flat on his back<br/>on the floor.<p>"She burned off your hair?" said Ukyo.<p>"She likes fire," muttered the boy as he looked away. "It was an<br/>accident at the time...I think. We used to play together, but she got<br/>worse as time went on..."<p>"This is..." said Ukyo as she stared at him dumbly. "Really<br/>weird."<p>"I haven't seen her in a while. We lost her a few months before<br/>China. I was kind of hoping she caught the hint after I ran away<br/>screaming the last time..."<p>Ukyo sighed. "And apparently, she didn't."<p>"That's about the size of it, yeah."<p>Genryu snorted as he sat on his stool again. "What are we gonna<br/>do?"<p>"You're not going to do anything. I can handle this on my own.<br/>You've got problems of your own to deal with," said Ranma as he stared<br/>at his younger brother for a moment.<p>"What?" cried Genryu.<p>"You're off on your own, married, and you've got Ryoga Hibiki to<br/>deal with. I'm hoping she'll ignore you since we aren't around each<br/>other all the time anymore."<p>"So, you want him to stay out of this?" said Ukyo with a smile<br/>forming on her face.<p>"If he can, yes. I want him to be on guard though," said Ranma<br/>firmly.<p>"No way! I ain't leavin you ta..."<p>"Shut up. It's my problem, and she won't kill me remember?" Ranma<br/>smirked at him. "I'll think of something, but for now, you just hang<br/>back. It'll make things easier if she's not worried about you."<p>Genryu growled at this, but nodded his head.<p>"Well, now that it's taken care of, I'm gonna head home." Ranma<br/>stood up and turned towards the door. "You kids behave yourselves.<br/>Just stay out of the way for a while okay? I'll be fine."<p>"So, I guess we should leave him be for now," said Ukyo with a<br/>small sigh.<p>Her husband merely nodded. "Yeah. I've got problems of my own." He<br/>didn't look very comfortable saying that and stood up.<p>"Where are you going?" said Ukyo as she frowned at him.<p>"I got a challenge today. I gotta train some," replied the boy as<br/>he walked out the door.<p>Ukyo growled at this. "Hey! You're leaving me to run this place on<br/>my own? You jackasss! Get back here!" She rushed out the door, but<br/>wasn't fast enough to catch him. "Damn it!"<p>After she walked back inside, Genryu let out a heavy sigh of<br/>relief as he stepped out of a nearby alleyway. "Man, that was close!<br/>Guess I can't come back here for a few days at least..." He hung his<br/>shoulders low and started walking. "I'll stop by the house and borrow<br/>some camping stuff from Ranma." He had his own, but didn't want to<br/>risk going back inside for them later on.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo was alone in the house. It wasn't that bad of a<br/>feeling really, especially with such a crowd at times. Rather than<br/>revel in the feeling of freedom, she found herself working in her<br/>room.<p>A notebook with names, numbers, and a lot of personal information.<br/>Most of it she'd never used, but it was there if she needed it. It was<br/>silent, and it made studying such things a little easier. With a lazy<br/>yawn, she stretched her arms and popped her back.<p>"I'm hungry."<p>She realized that she was a little uncomfortable, and the reason<br/>why all at once. She looked at her watch and realized that it was<br/>still somewhat early. Dinner would probably not be ready for a few<br/>hours even after Kasumi returned from the store. With a small shrug<br/>she stood up and walked out into the hallway and down the stairs.<p>She turned into the kitchen and ignored the refrigerator. Going<br/>directly to the cabinet where Kasumi kept the snacks, she pulled out a<br/>bag of chips and opened it as she closed the door by pulling on one<br/>end with her teeth. That would probably sate her appetite until dinner<br/>came. She decided to get a soda and walked over to the fridge. After<br/>she had what she needed she walked out of the kitchen and into the<br/>living room while munching casually.<p>Something caught her attention as she passed the bathroom though.<br/>It was a steady sound that she didn't recognize. Only the complete<br/>silence of the house allowed her to notice it at all. She paused and<br/>cocked her head, a potato chip still stuck between her lips. "What<br/>the?"<p>She turned towards the sound and entered the dressing room. It got<br/>a little louder, but she not much. With a frown she realized that it<br/>was coming out of the furo.<p>She jerked the door open and flicked on the light. As she looked<br/>into the room, her eyes went wide and the chip wedged between her lips<br/>fell to the ground. "Oh shit."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane walked home calmly. She was deep in thought and had a<br/>serious expression on her face as she moved closer and closer towards<br/>her destination. Her thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice<br/>though.<p>"Akane!"<p>The girl blinked and turned her head. Her sister was jogging up to<br/>her with a bag of groceries on her arm. "Oh! Imagine meeting you<br/>here!"<p>"Yeah," said the girl as a smile crept onto her face. "I was just<br/>heading home actually."<p>"We can walk together then," said Kasumi as she smiled at her<br/>sister.<p>"Yeah. Let me," she took the bag from the older girl and felt<br/>herself relax a bit. "It's like when we were little."<p>"Oh. Yes," agreed Kasumi as she giggled a little.<p>Akane found herself smiling a little more. "I wasn't expecting to<br/>see you here."<p>"Yes, Father and Mr. Saotome went out with Grandpa. He decided to<br/>take them out for a while. They should be back in time for dinner, but<br/>I didn't have enough food for everyone, so I had to go shopping for a<br/>few things."<p>Akane nodded at this and smiled. The dojo was still a fair<br/>distance away and they passed Tofu's office.<p>"Oh. I wonder if he's in?" said Kasumi as she looked at the<br/>building.<p>"Only when you're not around," commented Akane.<p>"Pardon?" said the girl sweetly.<p>"Nothing," said Akane as she smiled at her. "Come on. We're almost<br/>at the dojo."<p>"Oh. All right then," said Kasumi as she nodded. "Father should be<br/>home soon anyway."<p>"Right," said Akane as she rolled her eyes. Eating dinner with the<br/>old pervert who had shown up was not high on her list of things she<br/>wanted to do. Still, she could defend herself to a point, and he<br/>wasn't too pushy. That struck her as rather odd, considering how he<br/>treated most of the other women he'd met. Kasumi and Nabiki were also<br/>largely unmolested.<p>The pair quickly found themselves at the gate. Kasumi opened the<br/>way and smiled at her sister. "After you."<p>Akane took a single step forward.<p>The house exploded in a ball of flame. The force of the explosion<br/>threw both girls back. Akane found herself reeling and rolled across<br/>the pavement as debris showered down on them from above. Kasumi was<br/>slumped down against the wall that had surrounded the dojo with a<br/>small trickle of blood running down her forehead.<p>The younger girl stared forward painfully from on the ground. She<br/>gasped as she saw the burning remains of her home. "No! I..."<p>That was when the world went black.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Evil. I am so evil. Tee hee! ^_^
