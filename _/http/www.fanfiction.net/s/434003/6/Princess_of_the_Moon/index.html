</div>Notes - It's been a few weeks since I last posted a chapter for this story, it took a little longer than normal due to a bit of writers block (I started a couple of new ideas to get rid of it), and some of the stuff I did with Jedite in this chapter. I am trying to show a more workable version of the Dark Kingdom without redoing the entire thing from scratch. I like to stick to the core ideas of characters, but don't mind altering them to fit my needs either so long as they stay basically the same.<p>Yes I have finally gotten my own web site up. It is just a basic one, but good enough to hold four stories for free. ^^;<p>.com/BookmarkBlvd/crose9/<p>**********<br/>Princess of the Moon<br/>Chapter 05<br/>By Cory D. Rose<br/>(c)2001<p>Sailor Pluto was irritated for once, now this wasn't all that unusual for most, but for her it was a little strange. She had access to the biggest and most intensive cheat sheet in all of creation and even with it helping her she couldn't figure out what was going on. She stood before the Time Gate and watched as it hummed away normally and ignored her as she tired to make it show her what was wrong with the Time Stream. This was a rare occurrence and tended to happen when there was about to be a major change in the flow of time. In the last 10,000 years she had seen this happen maybe 3 times. There was no way to stop them and she knew that with every one that happened there was a chance that her dream of Crystal Tokyo could be obliterated.<p>She despised the idea, but there was nothing she could do without breaking her Oath, to the first Queen Serenity, from so long ago. Pluto sighed and stepped back and did the only thing she could do in this situation, she reached into sub space and pulled out a large bottle of whisky and drank half of it. She'd had lots of practice over the years, to bad the stuff barely affected her anymore. After putting it back she sat down on a folding chair and looked at the gate again, then she glared and it sweat dropped.<p>"Show me what is wrong."<p>The door opened silently to show her a scene she hadn't expected and like any good history program was even in sound. She pulled a bowl of popcorn out of subspace and made herself comfortable, wishing for the thousandth time that she could remember to at least bring more than a dammed folding chair for her to relax in. The door opened into a large and very ugly hall that Pluto had only ever seen once before and smirked as the images flowed. She pulled a bag of caramel popcorn out of subspace and ate a handful and watched in interest.<p>"It couldn't have happened to a better guy." She commented. Now if she could just get over this caramel popcorn addiction. ^^<p>**********<p>There were days that he hated his life, but there wasn't anything he could do to make it better. He could crush his enemies, he could take pleasure in cowing his minions if need be, but if he failed at anything it was like all his accomplishments had been for nothing. Of course he wasn't any better said a small part of his mind, but he ignored it. Jedite sighed and nearly chocked himself to death as he remembered where he was. Take a pit, fill it with a dark green slimy water, maggots, leaches, and other like minded creatures and drop victim in. Make sure it is deep enough so that they have to swim, but the level of the liquid is about a foot from the top of the pit then cover it with a bamboo or similar grate that is embedded into the floor.<p>Don't forget to take the victims clothes, got to get all that liquid in places where it doesn't need to be after all. Jedite held himself in place in the center of the grating, he would have been against the side of the pit, but some enterprising fellow had put thousands of needle sharp spikes all along the wall. It had seemed like such a good and evil idea at the time too, Beryl had complemented him on it and everything. Him and his big mouth, now if he could just keep from swallowing to much of this stuff he might not be poisoned. Oh yeah, he complained to himself, take ideas from the humans since they are as evil as they are stupid.<p>He had been dropped in here by a cackling Zoicite on Beryl's orders just three short days ago. Normal punishment in this manner was ten to thirty day, after two hours he had really wanted out. So now after three days he would have given up his first born child to get out and take revenge against those Scouts, especially that red headed bitch. She was going to pay for humiliating him like this, he was a General of the Dark Kingdom and had broken and enslaved beings more powerful than her for centuries!<p>Jedite growled and again tried to break the magically reinforced bamboo, but had to give up after a few minutes. He reviewed his latest plan and wondered where it had gone so wrong, but the only thing he could come up with was allowing that red headed bitch on the boat. He had even smiled at her and plotted her death as she walked up the stairs from the dock to the main deck. Then there had been that blonde girl with her, she had to be connected to her in someway, he would find out even if he had do torture it out of the red head. Jedite screamed and thrashed for several minutes, it made him feel better.<p>Things had been going so well until she showed up. He would send out a weak Youma to distract the scouts while he personally sucked dry entire buildings across town. Then she had shown up and caught him in the middle of a plan, he had later learned that his distraction had gathered more energy than he had. This in turn had Beryl on his ass again and she ordered him to focus on killing the little school girls instead of collecting energy, it should have taken a day or two at the most to do them in and get things back to normal. Then he learned that these Scouts, why in the hell were they so familiar to him, seemed to have the luck of the gods on their sides. He set up traps that they walked into with ease, then things seemed to blow up in his face as they took down one Youma after another.<p>Even moving some of the operation to England had proven useless when a Scout showed up there too. They were making the little bitch famous too, he would have to put a stop to that when he had a chance. They were like bugs that he just couldn't quite catch and it was driving him mad, but it all boiled down to one thing. That red head was going to get what was coming to her when he had the chance. He would crush her spine and make her into a permanent sex doll or a mindless slave. To just kill her was a waste of time when she could be put to servicing a whole platoon of Youma or used as a battery to fuel a completely useless machine. Jedite laughed evilly and thrashed around again for a few minutes, he could feel something crawling up his inner thigh.<p>He heard foot steps and looked up as Kunzite and Zoicite stepped up to the pit and smirked down at him. "Queen Beryl wants you cleaned up and brought before her Jedite." Kunzite said.<p>"Do you think she meant washed down and naked?" Zoicite said. "OHOHOHOHOHO!"<p>Jedite winced.<p>"Now Zoicite, get a hold of yourself, Jedite had been punished for his stupidity long enough." He motioned and several Youma appeared to open the grate and pulled a shivering Jedite out of the pit.<p>They dragged a limp Jedite down the hall and tossed him in a small alcove, he groaned. A water Youma, one of Titus' lowers, held out her hand and blasted Jedite for several minutes in a high powered wash that left him black and blue from the chest down. All of his magical defenses had been stripped from him when they placed him in the pit and blocked off his powers, so he had no protection from the force of the Youma's water cannon. Jedite recalled the beating he had received from Nephrite when he returned and seethed, this wasn't as bad as that, but they were all out to destroy each other and would take any advantage to bring one of their enemies down. Jedite would endure and triumph from this then make the others pay in spades, it was the way of this dark and terrible world. You were either the one in charge or you were a slave, there was no middle ground.<p>Now clean and dripping, Zoicite looked him over with a barely concealed interest and tossed him a hand towel and told him to dry off. A few minutes later he was tossed a uniform and he donned the thing like a good friend. One of the few he could trust, but a blow to his back from one of the guards reminded him that he had more humiliation to come. He staggered under the blow and had to bit his tongue to keep from crying out in pain as a bruise was added to his already much abused skin.<p>"Come Jedite, it is time and Queen Beryl is waiting for you in the main chamber." Kunzite said as he walked off with Zoicite holding his arm and smirking at him.<p>If it wasn't for the fact that Kunzite could have blown him away with a simple flick of his wrist, Jedite would have insulted him. "Let's get this over with."<p>"You have failed completely Jedite, you managed to get Titus killed and wasted more energy in this one operation than all the others combined. I'd say you are on the verge of being destroyed, Jedite." Zoicite giggled.<p>"I agree with Zoicite, you have failed when it should have never even been a problem Jedite. Have you been doing it on purpose?" Kunzite asked.<p>One of the main things Jedite hated about Kunzite was that on top of him being one of the most powerful Generals, he was as arrogant as they came. Only the red headed bitch seemed to be more arrogant, Kunzite seemed to have this concept that if it needed to be done then destroy everything in the path and build it back from the ground up as you want it to be. It made things easier to do, but tended to make most Youma fear him like the plague and very few ever stayed around to swear their loyalties to Kunzite, or Zoicite for that matter. "Kunzite, those little girls as you call them seem to have been designed to kill us and our Youma and they have this luck that allows them to find just the right way to do so, they are always in the right place at the right time. Don't underestimate them just because of what they look like."<p>"Their young teenage girls Jedite, there is no way they could do everything they have so far."<p>"Things were working along those lines at first, remember, then that red head showed up and things went to hell." Jedite snapped. The guard behind him decided that the prisoner was being too forward and backhanded him across the skull, sending him into a wall.<p>"Thank you." Zoicite said with a smirk.<p>"Agreed." Kunzite said. "Jedite, you forget your place."<p>"I..." groan "...will get my revenge for this."<p>"I doubt that Jedite, the Queen is royally pissed with you."<p>The guard lifted Jedite off the floor like a sack of potatoes and set him on his feet, Jedite stumbled forward a few steps before he gained control again. He would make them all pay for this humiliation, he swore under his breath. He wiped the blood from his lip as he glared at all of them. They continued to walk along in silence for several minutes and Jedite realized this was the first time in a couple of centuries that any of them had been defeated like he had been. It reminded him of that time Queen Beryl had gone on a rampage as she purged all the suspected traitors from her ranks and killed over 30,000 of their Youma. Luckily it had only been Youma or Jedite suspected they would have been killed too, instead it had the exact effect that Beryl had been wanting in the first place. Unswerthing loyalty from all, no matter how stupid the order or dangerous, they feared Beryl more than anyone else in the Kingdom and would do it without question.<p>They entered the great hall and Jedite was surprised to see that Beryl had opened it to the masses. There were thousands of Youma, Lower and Higher versions all around them as they made their way down the only path that lead right to Queen Beryl's throne. A garish one at that, made from the skulls of the 30,000 dead Youma from so long ago, all of them set in the black beryl stone of the main throne. Beryl herself sat on this in her formal dress that seemed to have been painted on, her red hair was a nightmare that was styled to induce fear in all that saw it. She had white skin and fangs to match, her eyes were cruel and glinted with evil and power as they studied him. In front of her was a crystal ball pulsing with evil power directly linked to the imprisoned Matalia who watched from all the eyes of the skull throne.<p>"I have brought the prisoner, Queen Beryl." Kunzite said as he stepped forward.<p>"Excellent Kunzite. Bring the condemned forward!"<p>The guard stiff armed Jedite across the shoulder blades and propelled him forward several steps. The booing and hissing of the crowd told him that he was in serious trouble if even they were turning against him. He looked up at Queen Beryl and cringed, hoping for a merciful day seemed to be out of the question. "My Queen..."<p>"Explain yourself Jedite, why have you failed to accomplish such a simple task?"<p>"Those Scouts are tougher than they look my..." A blast of dark power fired out of the eyes of the throne and slammed into Jedite. He screamed as he was thrown the length of the hall and slammed into a wall.<p>"I don't want your excuses Jedite, I want all the life energy in that city. Why have you failed?" Queen Beryl yelled.<p>"...THAT RED HEADED BITCH IS WHY!" Jedite yelled as he crawled to his feet.<p>Beryl's eyes narrowed. "That newest girl, the one you told us about a few weeks ago, the one that had that silver crescent moon on her head?"<p>Jedite coughed up some blood. "Yes!"<p>"You know what she is Jedite, you told me yourself she wouldn't be a problem so long as you took precautions. Were you lying to me?"<p>"No! If she was like the rest from Serenity's family from so long ago she would have been easy to deal with, but she is a Scout and a trained fighter like the Queen's Elite Guard. Those have always been hard to take down even when you take away their powers they have they know how to use their own life force as a weapon."<p>"An Elite, one of those would be more than enough to free Matalia Jedite, why didn't you mention this either?"<p>"I didn't even know until this last attack, I saw her fighting Titus and winning and scanned her a little deeper. I didn't know..."<p>"Silence!" Beryl screamed. The guard grabbed and dragged him back and threw him at the foot of Beryl's throne in a body slam. Some dark power flowed out of the base and picked Jedite up by his neck and lifted him off the floor. He struggled for a few seconds as his air is cut off, clawing at the dark energy holding him. "Thank you for reminding me about Titus, it seems you have also cost us one of our most promising Youma as well Jedite. My patients is at an end with you. It seems you fail at everything you do now a days and that isn't a smart thing to do around here."<p>Jedite screamed as black electricity fried him, but it stopped after a few seconds and he hung limply in the steel grip.<p>"You shall be given one more chance Jedite, because of your excellent past efforts and unwavering loyalty."<p>The dark power let go and dropped Jedite to the floor, he gasped for air and coughed for several seconds. "..."<p>"Kunzite, Zoicite!"<p>"My Queen?" They chorused.<p>"Take Jedite to his room and release him from is inhibiters, but put these on his writs as a reminder of his failure." Beryl gestured and a pair of iron arm bands appeared in front of them."They are a magical timer, once he leaves this base he will have one week to take the Scouts down or they will activate and bring him before me once more."<p>"What will his punishment be for failure My Queen?" Nephrite asked from his place in the crowd.<p>"...Permanent Crystal Imprisonment!"<p>There whole room gasps in horror and cringes, Jedite barely manages to keep from fainting. "Great..." he gasps.<p>**********<p>She held up the slip of paper and frowned at it, if it had been alive it would have been cringing or running away in fear. The girl that had handed it to her didn't look all that pleased either and was getting ready to run if she needed to. Nabiki lowered the paper and sighed and looked around at the girl. "Is this all we came up with?"<p>"I'm afraid so, the name Saotome is common, but combined with the name Ranma it gets a lot harder to connect. We couldn't find anyone in that age group with the name Ranma Saotome, all we came up with was the name Ranma Mazaki in Juban and that was a girl. Here's a picture of her from the file."<p>Nabiki looked it over and thought the red head was quite good looking, but she was looking for a boy, not a girl. Unless...Genma Saotome was a liar and had a curse to, could that have been why Ranma abandoned him? Because that old fart managed to curse him maybe? Could it have been as a panda too? She doubted it, but getting Genma to talk was like pulling teeth sometimes. It didn't help that he was eating everything in the house either and her father expected them to just allow him to freeload. She looked at the picture and blinked as an idea occurred to her, if there was a spring of drowned panda could there be a drowned girl spring too? It was a little gross in her opinion, but if there was and Ranma fell in it, why did he run away like he did?<p>"What else do you have on this Ranma Mazaki?"<p>"She is an expert Martial Artist and is rumored to have magical powers."<p>"Why?"<p>"She has been seen helping the Sailor Scouts in Juban on a couple of occasions and was seen working out in the park a few weeks back. She ran around the park several times and ran a number of professional runners into the ground then spent a couple more hours practicing martial arts, like the run was just a warm up."<p>"That's incredible, don't let Akane hear about that or she will go ballistic to prove herself, again."<p>"We'll keep it covered up."<p>"Let's dig a little deeper into Mrs. Mazaki shall we. Even if she isn't the one were looking for she could be very profitable if we set up the right environment."<p>"Sure thing boss."<p>After she had left Nabiki looked the picture over again and smiled as several more ideas came to her. She wondered if this was the time she would be implementing a plan she had been considering for some time now. She hated this school with her whole being and her younger sister was large part of the problem. This Ranma Mazaki seemed like she might be just what she was looking for. Nabiki shook herself and looked up just as the class idiot approached and sighed, yay, another deal to make.<p>"Nabiki Tendo, I would speak with you!"<p>"Hello Kuno-baby I have some pictures for you if you want some." Nabiki said as she pulled some photos of her little sister out. There were four of her practicing and the one that Kuno wanted, one of her in the bathroom. He paid nearly anything to get these glamour shots and Nabiki had to sell them to have enough money to keep her sister in building supplies to break. Like boards and cinder blocks, she tended to take her frustrations out on them instead of others, for which Nabiki was grateful. Though her sister had no idea about the nudes that Kuno had been buying lately.<p>"Excellent..." Kuno grabbed the pictures and slapped 20,000 yen in Nabiki's hand. He started to drool over them and had this silly little grin on his face the Nabiki loved to see, it meant he was being perverted again. Then Kuno stopped and his eyes tripled in size and he began to shake.<p>'This is new, he hasn't done that before.' Nabiki thought and stepped around him to see which picture he was looking at. It was the one of Ranma Mazaki that she had been looking at, she must have accidentally handed it over with the others. She cursed herself for her sloppiness, normally she didn't make mistakes like that. She grabbed it out of his hands and smirked as he blinked as if he had lost something precious. "Sorry about that Kuno-baby, she is someone I'm looking for, a relative of mine. I gave her picture to you by mistake."<p>"Nay, the fates have chosen to shine down upon me this day, for your mistake has been my gain. That vision of loveliness had bewitched my heart and entrapped my soul eternal!" Kuno yelled and made a grab for the photo.<p>Nabiki frowned and pulled it away before he could get his hands on it. "No Kuno, this photo is not for sale just yet. I might have more for you in the future, but for now she is off limits."<p>"She is a battle maiden of power and grace, it shines in her eyes and grace and definition of her proud and noble body! I must have that photo to add to my collection Nabiki Tendo, how much?"<p>"50,000 yen, see it's to expensive..." Nabiki blinked as said amount appeared in her hand and Kuno walked off with the photo. She couldn't even remember handing it over, but the money was a blessing in disguise. Whoever that girl was, she was a money making potential made flesh. Her looks could bring in millions of yen if things were played right, she had find her and get her to pose for some more shots. Nabiki pocketed the money, made some notations in her notebook files and spent the rest of the lunch hour taking care of bets and information gathering. She handed 10,000 yen to the girl that had brought her the information on Ranma Mazaki, much to the girl's delight, and told her it was a bonus for a job well done.<p>After school she collected her things and exiting the school with a ton of ideas on her mind. She had plans to make and a train to catch, Ranma Mazaki had just become her new project. A fate that most of the student body of the school would have dreaded like a plague or worse. The Ice Queen was the last thing anyone in their right mind wanted to attract, her ideas and threats were thought out and implemented with deadly accuracy. After looking around for several seconds, she spots Akane just down the block, what is odd is that she is talking to a rather well muscled girl. She is wearing green shirt and a bandanna to hold her wild blonde hair in place.<p>The girl is taller than most girls, very petty in a natural sort of way, and carrying a very large backpack. She is in a thread bare old green shirt that has seen better days, a pair of black pants with the lets wrapped in string, and has a tiger stripped bandanna on to keep her wild blonde hair out of her eyes. The girl looks dangerous and mean, like what one would find in a long time gang member or something. Nabiki wanders over and listens to them as they talk, she gets the surprise of her life when she does. Who would have thought she would get confirmation of her theory so soon after she had even considered the possibility?<p>"How did it happen?" Akane asked concerned. A rare thing for Akane to be sure, considering her explosive temper tantrums of late. Nabiki was always on her toes around her sister, she didn't want to be on the receiving end of that Ki mallet again anytime soon. Though that was what had prompted her to start selling those nudes of her.<p>"What's going on Akane?"<p>"Hi sis, I was just waiting here for you when this boy walks up and starts to ask me something, I was about to pound him, when he is splashed by that puddle there when one of the buses sped by. Then he turned into this girl!"<p>"Really? How did that happen?"<p>"Um...well, I get lost easily and I wondered into this little valley in China while chasing one of my enemies. I was dealing with something when I tripped and fell into one of the springs and came out like this, luckily it is reversible and I stay human. There were springs there that turned people into animals like cats, bears, even pigs." The girl/boy said.<p>"That sounds like a Jusenkyo curse to me." Nabiki commented.<p>"It is, how do you know of them?"<p>"Our family has an unwanted house guest that changes into a panda..."<p>The girl growled and yelled. "A panda? If it is the same one, it may be the one responsible for my curse!"<p>"I thought you tripped?"<p>"I did, but a panda tried to clock me over the head with a wooden sign, while holding up other signs that said things like 'you are perfect' and 'my wife won't kill me now that my son is no more'. It was the signs more than anything that startled me and I tripped into the spring as I was dodging and backing away, by the time I pulled myself out the panda took one look at me and disappeared. I've been chasing it ever since."<p>"Akane, this does sound like Genma doesn't it?"<p>"Yes it does."<p>"Genma...Saotome?" The girl snarled, her cute fangs glinting in the sunlight.<p>"That would be him alright, why?"<p>"I'm trying to find his son so that I can kill him."<p>"You know Ranma Saotome?" Akane asked.<p>"Yeah, the coward ran out on a duel we had set up."<p>"Ran..." Akane snarled, she hated boys and this was all the proof she needed.<p>"...Out?" Said Nabiki, she narrowed her eyes. Something wasn't adding up here and she wanted to know why.<p>"Is this Genma staying with you?"<p>"Genma is the panda." Akane said.<p>"What? Take me there, if he is the panda I want to make him pay!"<p>"Excuse me, but what is your name any way?" Nabiki asked while she ignored the glare Akane was giving her.<p>"Ryoga Hibiki."<p>"Well Ryoga, follow us back to the house. Come on Akane, Mr. Saotome seems to have attracted a good number of guests lately."<p>"What do you mean?" Ryoga asked.<p>"Your not the first one to show up wanting a piece of Mr. Saotome."<p>"Oh yeah, didn't that boy with the large spatula show up last week and beat him into the ground?" Akane asked.<p>"Yep, and all those other girls and venders that had been following him for some time now." Nabiki said.<p>"You see Ryoga, Genma has this habit that has our father frothing mad. It seems he likes to sell his son to families for food and engagements and stuff. Ranma will be lucky to get out of everything that old man did to him."<p>Ryoga laughed. "That serves the jerk perfectly, ever since I met him he has been the cause of all my problems."<p>Akane sighed and patted the transformed girl on the arm. "Well, lets get back to the house and get you some hot water."<p>"Thanks Akane, I appreciate that."<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes when the two completely ignored her and walked off together, well it should work out if she had any clue how things worked. Akane did hate boys and this Ryoga was half girl. She pulled Ranma Mazaki's file out of her book bag and flipped through it again. She grinned when she found several other pictures clipped to the inside, most of these were of her in gym or playing sports like any athlete would. She spotted something in one photo that she hadn't noticed before, she was wearing a school uniform, Juban High School if she was remembering right. Flipping back a few pages she confirmed it with the info gathered from one Umino Gurio, the information sponge from Jubaan High. She grinned, it looked like she was going to be taking a trip today, she wanted to meet this Ranma Mazaki if she could. The first thing she would do if she was going to give up her family would be to set up a false identity, but if it was Genma's son, why had he kept his first name and why was he going as a girl?<p>Now what did those signs Ryoga mentioned mean? 'My wife won't try to kill me now that my son is no more', what had Mr. Saotome meant by that? To many questions and not enough answers to go around. Now this was getting interesting, what would happened to them if Ranma had showed up with Mr. Saotome? So far they had been dealing with a good number of Mr. Saotome's past mistakes as they caught up with him and most of them wanted to take things out on this Ranma as well. What kind of person was this Ranma and...why was she standing around looking like an idiot in the middle of the sidewalk?<p>Sheesh.<p>**********<p>Ami was confused about something's that had happened lately, it was mystery she had been trying to solve for some weeks now. Her name was Ranma Mazaki, their princess and leader (supposedly) according to Luna. She was one of the oddest girls she had ever had the pleasure of meeting and that was saying a lot since she was friends with Usagi. Ami sighed as she leaned back in her chair, her mind elsewhere, she had been working on her home work when she started to think about Ranma.<p>The girl was a mystery even now, she had turned down an invitation to come to all the Scout meetings they'd held since they found her. The one time Ami could remember her talking to them was when they first met and that had been a little hostile. When the cruise had happened and they had several hours to wait for the coast guard to show up, Ami had tried to talk to the girl, but she had avoided talking to them quite a bit by telling them she wasn't ready yet. Of all of them Usagi knew the most, well maybe Luna but she wasn't talking and Ranma's cat Ito was just a mysterious to them. Ever since Ito had shown up they had been inseparable, but a lot more secretive and closed mouthed about things.<p>The only conclusion Ami could figure out was that they were hiding something from them. Something Ito and Luna knew about and something Ranma was afraid of, either that or she just didn't trust them enough. Usagi liked the girl, but had stated that she would get her revenge on her for dumping a bucket of water on her to wake her up and a number of other things she didn't want to talk about.<p>Ranma was friendly to all of them, but she kept a wall between them to keep them from getting to close. If what she understood was true, that she was indeed their princess, Ranma would have to let her guard down and accept them all as her guards and friends. The one time they had suggested that she allow them to bodyguard her Ranma had fell over laughing. She was a fighter of incredible skill and power, even the Mercury computer was a bit baffled about some of her abilities at times. When she was transformed she was easy to read, but it was when she was in 'civilian' mode that the little computer was baffled about things. Ranma's energy readings seemed to waver depending on her mood, from a barely detectible trace when she was happy or asleep, to incredibly dangerous when she was angry.<p>Her powers were also showing signs of altering in some way that Ami just couldn't understand yet. When they had first met Ranma she had been generating a pure Silver Millennium power signature, but over the past few weeks it had been changing mysterious ways and it was beginning to worry her. It wasn't a Dark Kingdom power signature in any way, just something different...and a bit unstable as well. That was the worst part, the fluctuations with her moods, magic shouldn't work like that. At least from the lessons she had read through in the little computer, they said that the body worked like a focusing lens of sorts to channel the magic. Emotions shouldn't have any reaction to the magic at all.<p>Another problem was Rei, she did not like the princess in any way what so ever. They had been at odds from the beginning. Ranma had shown up out of nowhere and did something to make her grandfather just accept her right off the bat. Ami wasn't so surprised though because of two reasons, Rei's grand father was always looking for good looking girls to work at the shrine and there was something about the girl that just made some people either like her or really hate her. One scan of the girl had shown that she had this aura of magic around her that affected her surroundings, what it did exactly was unknown, but is was really powerful.<p>There was knock on her door and it opened up to reveal her mother. "I wasn't sure if you were home or not."<p>"I was just thinking; how was work?"<p>"Pretty good, I got off early tonight because we have a guest coming by."<p>"A guest?" Ami asked. They almost never had anyone come by the apartment.<p>"An cousin of mine from way back, we used to go to school together."<p>"Really, who is it?"<p>"Her name is Nodoka Saotome."<p>"I don't remember her."<p>"I haven't seen her in a very long time, nearly sixteen years if I remember correctly. A couple of years before you were born."<p>"How long before she shows up?"<p>"About an hour so get cleaned up and ready."<p>"Alright mom." Ami said as her mother closed her door.<p>Ami had her communicator out a few seconds later and called Usagi and Rei.<p>"Hi Ami, what's the problem?" Rei asked as she appeared in the little screen, she looked a little irritated.<p>"I can't come over tonight like we planned, my mom just told me where having a guest over tonight and I have to meet her."<p>"That's okay Ami, we can do it in a few days." Rei said.<p>The screen blinked and a Usagi appeared, she was wearing a scarf around her head to cover up her nose. She seemed to be sneaking through an alley or some place equally dark and looking at the communicator covertly. "Good idea Ami, it gives me more time for my revenge. Tell me how it goes later, gotta go." Usagi whispered and turned off the communicator.<p>Rei appeared again, her eye twitching. "What is Odango up to?"<p>"I'm not sure, I think she is stalking Ranma to get even with her for pouring that bucket of water on her the other day."<p>"...Ranma is here at the temple, she is currently in the bath room taking a bath...oh great...gotta go Ami, I think I can hear Usagi about to get in trouble." Rei said and turned off the communicator.<p>Closing the communicator Ami wondered why things had gotten so weird ever since Ranma had shown up. It was so strange, before she had gotten here all they had to do was fight off a few monsters and listen to Usagi whine about it for a few hours and talk about boys. Now Usagi was about to do something to Ranma to get revenge for a that bucket of water, Rei seemed to actually dislike the girl for no good reason, and now the both of them were working together to get the girl. Ami took a few seconds to wonder what would happen, her curiosity was really peaked over this, but knew she would have to wait until tomorrow to find out.<p>Grabbing a towel off the pile on her dresser she made her way to the bathroom to take her own bath and turned her thoughts to this Nodoka Saotome person that was stopping by. Work almost always come first for her mother and for her to actually take the time off from work to have a dinner like this was exceedingly rare. Ami thought about it and couldn't think of one time her mother had ever done something like this, it was out of character for her. For a split second Ami was actually jealous of the woman, her mother never took the time to do anything with her anymore, the job always came first. She sighed and suppressed the alien feeling as she always did, he mom worked at the hospital and that was a responsibility that took precedence over family. She was proud of her mom though, just tired of eating supper alone all the time, she would just have to make the best of this situation.<p>Ami finished up and was just heading into the living room and adjusting her dress, a long dark skirt, a white blouse, and a stylish dark jacket, when she spotted her mom. She was dressed up in a pair of jeans and a bright pull over as she dashed around the kitchen humming a tune of some kind. Ami had to blink a few times, her mom was acting weird and didn't seem to be able to carry a tune to save her life.<p>"Honey, could you set the table for the three of us?"<p>"Sure mom." Ami said and went to grab the good plates out of the little hutch in the living room. She was just finishing up when the door bell went off.<p>"Aghhhhh! That's Her!" Mrs. Mizuno screeched.<p>Ami backed up a few steps and started to edge away from her mom, this was a little weird. "I'll get the door mom."<p>"Okay, go grab the door and I'll get the food set out."<p>Ami nodded and answered the door, there was a tall woman on the other side. She was wearing a flowered kimono, had a bundled rod of some kind strapped to her back, and was holding out a dish to her. "Thank you, come in." Ami said and took the dish, it was jello mold of some kind, with bits of banana floating in it. Yum. Taking a closer look, Ami noticed she had dark red hair, almost brown, and blue eyes. This Nodoka also looked a little sad, her smile didn't reach her eyes. There was a haunted look in them instead, it made a shiver run through Ami as she led the woman into the dinning room.<p>"Nodoka!" Her mom yelled and hugged the woman.<p>"Hellen!"<p>"How have you been No-chan, it has been years, I was caught totally by surprise when you called me out of the blue like that."<p>"I had to talk to someone..."<p>"What happened?"<p>Nodoka sighed sadly and all but collapsed into a chair. "I lost my son."<p>"Your son? The one you've spent the last ten years searching for? The one your husband took on that training trip? Martial Arts, wasn't it?"<p>"Yes, though I wish I had been able to stop my husband from taking him. Now it seems I am never going to see him again."<p>"What happed?"<p>"I got this post card in the mail..." Nodoka said sadly.<p>"What did it say?"<p>"According to the post card they had recently crossed into the deeper and more dangerous sections of China. They stumbled across this place called the 'Pool of Sorrow' or something like that. The place was cursed with some kind of ancient magic, I'm still searching through my papers to find out if this place really exsists. From what the card says it seems that my husband supposedly turns into a panda when he touches cold water and back to normal with hot water. I've never heard about anything like it in all my travels, but I have a feeling this the truth."<p>"That...that's insane!" Hellen yelled. "Did Ranma or Genma send that card?"<p>"Ranma did, his handwriting was so different from those letters that Genma sent me..." Nodoka said with a snarl as she recalled her husband and what she planned to do to him.<p>"What was the name of this place? Maybe we can help you find more about it." Hellen said and looked at her daughter.<p>"Jusenkyo, but I don't think you will find much on it since it is in such an isolated spot in the mountains of China." Nodoka said.<p>Ami wasn't so sure if that was the case, she did believe in magic and the name Jusenkyo sounded familiar to her for some reason. With the use of the Mercury computer she could look things up that most internet search engines could never find. Ami looked up from her thoughts and noticed that both women seemed to have forgotten she existed, oh well at least the story was interesting. She noted down a plan to look into Jusenkyo in the future just to see what this place was and if it was truely magic of some kind. Ami started to pay attention to the conversation again as Nodoka said something she had half expected.<p>"I know, but get this, my son said that Genma had knocked him into a spring as well. This one turning him into a girl, a girl of all things and he can't change back because it was one of the permanent springs."<p>"So your son now thinks he is a girl?"<p>"According to the post card, yes, and it gets worse."<p>"How can it get worse, did something else happen to them?"<p>"You know what my husband did to my and our family." Nodoka said her eyes glinting with hate.<p>"You'll get him No-chan, I know you will."<p>"I have some idea of where Genma is, but I wanted to talk to one of my friends before I went looking for him. The bastared would actually run forever if he could and he knows I'm on his furry tail."<p>"What are you gont to do to him?"<p>"I don't know, my honor demands that I gut him and mount his head on the front gates, but since this isn't fuedal Japan anymore, I'm not sure. I've had so many plans for when we finally settled things between us that I just can't decide. Most of them end in his death or permenent destruction."<p>Hellen shook her head, her friend has good reasons to hate Genma like she did, she was worried that the man would actually be able to stop her. She had been chasing him for years now, always a few steps behind him. The old fool seemed to have the instincts of an exceptional coward to be able to dodge his wife for this long. "No-chan you have always been to quick to pull that blade of yours to solve your problems."<p>"I know, but it Genma will not get away with what he has done."<p>"Maybe, but are you sure you're not letting your hatred get away from you?."<p>Nodoka narrowed her eyes at her friend and reigned in her rage, the anger that she was always struggling to control when her husband was mentioned. "..."<p>"Well we just need to see what we can do to find your son, even if he is now a girl for some reason, she should be pretty easy to find if we hire the right people."<p>"I'm afraid I can't do even that."<p>Hellen blinked in surprise. "Why is that?"<p>"Genma, he did something to make sure I couldn't do that and even with my wealth results from investigators and the police are few and far between."<p>"Don't worry about that No-chan, I will help you out however you need, this is your son were talking about here and your my friend."<p>"No, I can't impose on you like that, I will just search for him by myself, like I have for years now."<p>"No-chan let me help..." Hellen protested.<p>"Excuse me?" Ami asked. "You haven't said what your son's name is and I'm kind of curious."<p>"I haven't?" Nodoka said in surprise. "It's Ranma Saotome."<p>"Ranma?" Ami said, hiding her surprise at the name.<p>Nodoka and Hellen nodded and went back to talking while Ami wandered off to think a little on what had been said. Could Nodoka's son be their new reluctant Princess? They had the same first name and the Ranma they knew was a major tomboy, she refused to wear dresses unless forced or threatened, knew absolutely nothing about make up, was rude at times, thoughtless, and had foot in the mouth disease. Just like every other boy she had ever met in his age group, but if it was, why was she running around with them like she was?<p>There were just to many questions to be asked and Ranma liked to keep to herself as much as possible. She was going to have to push things if she wanted answers to her questions, but it was quite possible she was wrong in some way and could lose a friend if she pushed to hard. No, Ranma was a Scout and quite possibly their Princess, she would respond to a open question truthfully. It was one of the things Ami had noticed about Ranma, she couldn't lie very well, she was to open and very naive.<p>Then there was those readings she had gotten from Ranma over the last few weeks, her powers were fluctuating wildly. Could that have something to do with a boy that was changed by magic into a girl? Perhaps the Silver Millennium magic was at odds with the curse magic or maybe Ranma was a Princess only because of the curse magic's transformation? To many variables for her to look up, she needed more information to make a determination on the mystery. She would have tried the Mercury computer, but she had found that there were sections in it that were off limits to her or needed a code to access. Her answers may have been in there, but if they were she should have a way to access them since she was the one that supposedly programmed the thing in her past life on the moon.<p>Ami shook her head, there was no other choice, she would have to have a long talk with Ranma about her past whether she liked it or not. She had to make sure they had the right girl for the job, to many lives were at stake to make a mistake this early in the fight. Coming back into the kitchen Ami firmed her decision that she wasn't going to mention Ranma just now. There was to much of a chance she was wrong in some way she hadn't considered just yet, only time would tell if she right or wrong.<p>**********<p>She went over her list. Dressed in black ninja costume, check. Handkerchief mask, check. Stole...er...browed her brothers super soaker water gun complete with shoulder strap and cool targeting scope, check. Usagi grinned and made her way out her window just after the sun went down. She would get Ranma back for humiliating her like that, the bucket of water, running through town in her pajamas. Grrr, being better built than her too, she would pay. Usagi used all her skills to run from shadow to shadow along the little used streets between her house and the shrine, making sure no one saw her move.<p>Like a stealthy shadow Usagi moved with unerring grace and economy of movement, alighting from shadow to shadow like a wraith in the night. At a corner she peaked around to make sure no one was around to see her and moved on down the block with silent grace. She had been doing things like since she could remember, usually against her baka brother, but that didn't matter in the least, Ranma was going to pay. Just two more blocks and it would be time to go into battle. She stopped at the edge of a street light and carefully made her way around it so that she wasn't seen.<p>She was just two blocks from her goal when she made just the tiniest of errors and nearly upset the entire plan. Usagi sidled up against a metal fence and thought herself lucky that there were no lights on in the house, then disaster hit...<p>"BARK BARK Grrr BARK!" Barked the demon from hell. (Mexican Hairless Chiwawa.)<p>"AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Usagi screamed and ran down the street in a panic, tripped a little ways down and slammed into the metal trashcans set just into the edge of an alley. Clutching her bruised head, Usagi groaned and wondered just how many dogs were in this part of town as dozens of the started to bark up a storm. "Ite!"<p>With no grace or poise, Usagi rolled to her feet and ran away from the scene and hoped no one had seen anything. Gasping for air, she eventually reached the shadow filled stairs that lead up to the shrine itself and site of her prey. Slinging the water gun off her back she pulled a fedora out of subspace and placed it on her head, it was time to hunt. With a twinkle in her eye she grinned and moved into the bushes along side the steps and crept her way up to the top, slowly circling around to the back of the shrine. Her prey's room was located along the back if she remembered right.<p>At the edge of the woods around the shrine Usagi went ninja again and started alighting from shadow to shadow once more. She was crouched down beside one of the small sheds out back when her communicator started beeping. Cursing silently, she hoped some monster wasn't attacking again, she had made plans for tonight. She carefully pulled it out and activated to listen in on Ami and Rei as they talked, she grinned evilly as she heard that her prey was in the bathroom, and the bathroom window was on the other side of the shrine from where she was too. It was to perfect to believe.<p>Tapping a button on the communicator Usagi said. "Good idea Ami, it gives me more time for my revenge. Tell me how it goes later, gotta go."<p>She slithered forward, around the rock garden (tripped over it), past another shed (bounced off it when she tripped over a rock) and across the small koi pond (she fell in with a loud splash) and made her way to the bathroom window and grinned when she saw that it was open to let in the night air. This set up was just to perfect to believe, even her brother hadn't ever been this stupid. Crouching under the window she stood up and peaked inside...the bathroom was empty.<p>"Oh shit!" Usagi cursed and turned to leave.<p>A powerful flashlight illuminated Usagi as she turned, her eyes widening in horror as she spotted Rei holding the light. Ranma, wrapped in a towel appeared out of the darkness and smirked as she held up what looked like a couple of water balloons. "Hi Usagi."<p>"You wouldn't..."<p>"Yep."<p>"Usagi I can't believe you would do this." Rei said, for once looking smug at the cowering girl.<p>"Any last requests?"<p>"?" Usagi squeaked.<p>Ranma just shook her head and let fly.<p>Splat!<p>"AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" The scream of despair filled the night sky.<p>**********<p>The door to the Tsukino's house slammed open and Usagi stomped in with snarl, slamming the door behind her. Her parents could only stare in shock as their daughter stomped her way up the stairs. She was covered from head to toe in some kind of green gel (Prell shampoo, Ranma didn't have time to fill up regular balloons ^^), her ninja outfit had been removed and replaced with a bunny outfit complete with ears, tail and open midriff. Someone had used the green gel to do her blonde hair up in some kind of Madam Frankenstein look alike contest.<p>"That was way cool!" Shingo yelled and jumped up and down in glee.<p>"SNARL!" Usagi snarled at Shingo as she finished going upstairs and into the bathroom to clean up. 'Ranma and Rei were going to pay for this even if it took her a hundred years to do it!' She thought.<p>Her parents were to shocked to do much but stare.<p>**********<p>An couple days later Nabiki was walking though Jubaan, Kuno's money and taxi's were a godsend, as she headed towards the main entrance to Jubaan High School. She was glad that things worked a little different in Jubaan than in Nerima, it made it easier for her to get things done. She spotted a geek that was doing business like she did at Furinkan, only the little idiot seemed to just give the information away and refused to use it to make money like she did. That was unfair, he made plenty of money off his information, he just seemed to care more about the consequences than she and her assistant's did. She waved at him and he made his way over. There was another reason why she liked him too, it was good for her wallet.<p>"Hello Miss. Tendo."<p>"So Umino, where did you get all that info on that girl?"<p>"She's a class mate of mine."<p>"I'd like to meet her if I can."<p>"She isn't here..."<p>"Why is that?"<p>"School got out about half an hour ago and she doesn't go to any of the clubs around here. She hates being here and is off the grounds almost the instant the bell rings."<p>"Your kidding, even I go to an accounting club once or twice a week."<p>"She is a strange one, I would have expected her to be right at home in Furinkan actually. She is a fighter and can be as rude as they come and yet she can be the nicest person in the world if she wants to. Most of the boys in the school want to date her and the girls are violently jealous of her looks."<p>"Oh, do you know where I can find her?"<p>"Sure."<p>"Where?"<p>"What do you have in exchange?"<p>Nabiki smiled, Umino never wanted money, he wanted in information or something that would sate his geek like cravings. She grabbed her bag and pulled out a disk she had gotten in trade with one of the odd Jubaan students that passed through Furinkan. "This is supposed to be either a powerful virus or a kind of infiltration program I came into position of, will it do?"<p>Umino drooled and nodded. "You can find Ranma at the Hikawa Shrine a couple mile from here. She's been staying there for the last few weeks, as far is I know she is homeless and has nowhere else to stay."<p>Nabiki handed him the disk. "Thank you, the more I learn about this girl the more convinced I become she is the one I'm looking for."<p>"Let me know if there is anything else you need Miss. Tendo, I'm always willing to help out."<p>"Of course, the same goes for you Umino, just give me a call if you need anything." Nabiki said as she pulled out a map of Jubaan and located Hikawa Shrine. It was a bit of a maze, but nothing serious if she stayed alert.<p>Four hours later Nabiki was cursing herself for getting lost and dashed under an overhang outside an arcade just as the rain began to come down. She was in Jubaan, the sun was going down and it was raining worse than it did in Nerima at times. The winds buffeted her and almost peeled her off the wall she was hiding again, thunder rolled over the city and startled her. She wished the arcade was open for her to take cover in, but it was closed up and locked down just like most of the businesses along the street.<p>She hadn't expected to get lost like this and hadn't brought alone an umbrella since it had been nice and sunny out when she arrived. Maybe this hadn't been all that a good idea after all she though to herself. Then heard something...odd...she turned her head and saw a monster standing in the street looking at her like it was hungry. Nabiki blinked and gulped, it was the ugliest thing she had ever seen in her life. It stood about two meters high and was somewhat female in appearance. It also seemed to be made out of some kind of tar like substance and wearing a tutu of all things. She had to repress a giggle as she stared at it, the thing was a florescent pink too.<p>"What do we have here, lunch?" The thing said.<p>"Not if I can help it." Nabiki muttered and tried to find the best escape rout, she would take her chances with the storm.<p>"Be a good little victim and don't try anything heroic girlly, you won't like what I will do to you then."<p>Nabiki blinked and took off, she wasn't going to fight this thing. She had some fighting skill, but this was one of Jubaan's famous Youma. She knew that only the Scouts could deal with these things with a minimum of damage. She flew around the corner and spotted a small hill in the distance, a temple, the perfect place to hide out from a Youma. The were supernatural and shouldn't be able to enter the place. It was perfect, except for one little thing, it was pretty far away and she was on foot being chased by the ugly thing in a tutu.<p>Looking back she growled in anger as it seemed to be a Warner Brothers reject or something, it was casually trotting behind her as she ran. Keeping up with her easily, just like cartoon or something. What had she done to have this happen, she kept out of trouble and made sure all her bases were covered before she made her moves. Her enemies were very few and none of them could create or call a thing like this, was she just in the wrong place at the wrong time?<p>"Come on 'Lunch' don't be that way, I just want your energy, it won't take long and you don't really need it anyway." The monster called out to her.<p>"Baka!"<p>Lightning flashed and the thunder rolled around them as Nabiki ran and in the distance, at the top of the hill she could just make out a bright flash of red light among the trees. Whatever it was, Nabiki felt it was a good thing, she could feel in her stomach as she neared the stairs to the temple. She spotted the sign that said it was the 'Hikawa Shrine' and rolled her eyes at her luck, like it mattered now. She was gasping for air by now and cursing herself for getting so out of shape. Taking the stairs two at a time she flew up them quickly and recalled a few lessons from her youth from when her father had talked about the amazing things one could do when one mastered their own bodies to perfect the Art. Increased speed, stamina, strength, and power were all staples of her family art and she realized she had given that up after her mother's death. If she survived this she would take it up again just so she could survive something like this the next time it happened.<p>Reaching the top of the stairs was a challenge for her and she had to stumble across the entrance way and marveled at the tall wooden gateway that towered above her and the steps. She had no energy left and hoped the tales of the temples being safe from monsters like this were true. It reached the top a few seconds later and strolled under the gateway as if nothing was affecting it and Nabiki knew she was in trouble now, this place wasn't safe. It wasn't a refuge or...<p>The monster held out it's hand and Nabiki gasped as she felt her energy being drawn from her body. She gasped for air and tried to crawl away in fear, she whimpered in fear for the first time in years. Only Akane had ever made her feel this way and that had been a long time ago when she had been on the receiving end of her mallet. She gasped and felt her arms give way and she fell over, then the most amazing thing happened and had she the energy to do anything about it, she would have cheered in relief. A pair of strong arms wrapped themselves around her and she was airborne.<p>Looking up weakly, Nabiki saw the strong features and red hair of the girl she had been looking for. She was wearing a white Chinese shirt and from what she could tell, did not have a bra on to control her large breasts. Nabiki felt them flip in mid air and land so softly that she barely noticed, in the back round she saw a red skirted Sailor Scout launch a fire ball at the monster and blow it back off it's feet. Ranma smiled at her and sat her down as gently as a feather.<p>"You stay here okay, I have to help out Mars."<p>"T-thank you..." Nabiki stuttered.<p>"No problem, I'll be back in a minute." Ranma said and patted her on the shoulder, then stood up and changed...her smile vanished as she turned around and dark blue aura of power exploded around her body and made her clothing ruffle and shift around. Then she brought her hands together and aura shifted from around her body and highlighted her hands. "Mars, NOW!"<p>The red skirted Scout fired off another fire ball and flipped to the roof just as Ranma fired a blast of bright blue Ki out of her hands and hit the monster. It exploded and blew the thing back several feet, it nearly recovered, but Mars jumped off the roof and kicked the thing in the chest, sending it down the stairs. Then two other Scouts appeared, one blue and another in white. They landed on top of the wooden gate to the temple, the one in white pulled off her Tiara and held it as it started pulsing with power, then threw it like a frisbee. Nabiki heard the monster scream from down below and knew it was dead, she thanked whatever Kami had been listening to her when she made it here.<p>The red headed girl relaxed and waved as the three Scouts leaped off and vanished before she could get a good look at them. She turned back to Nabiki and smiled, it lit up her whole face and Nabiki had to use all her control to not break down in relief in front of her. Ever the professional, she steeled herself and slowly stood up and looked her rescuer over. She liked what she saw instantly, a perfect body and eyes that were as expressive as they came, she could see the worry in Ranma's eyes and it made Nabiki feel something she both dreaded and savored.<p>"Are you alright, that thing got some of your energy before I could get to you, sorry about that."<p>"That's alright, I'm Nabiki Tendo."<p>"Ranma Mazaki."<p>They heard foot steps and a dark haired girl in Shinto garb stepped out of the shrine and glared at Ranma. "Ranma, are you going to invite her in or do I have to do it myself, the Scout's already took care of that monster."<p>"Sorry Rei, I hadn't gotten around to it yet."<p>"Well move it, she needs to get some food in her stomach to shake off whatever that thing did to her."<p>Ranma's stomach growled loudly, she blushed. "Um...Miss. Tendo would you like to come in for supper?"<p>"Sure, I wanted to talk to you anyway."<p>"Oh?"<p>"Yep."<p>"Might as well ask me whatever it is then."<p>"Are you Ranma Saotome?"<p>Ranma kept a straight face, but the sudden anger in her eyes was a surprise to Nabiki. "Where did you hear that name?"<p>"From Genma Saotome when I was told that I might be engaged to his son."<p>"What makes you think I would know him Miss. Tendo." Ranma asked as they stepped inside and headed for the dinner table.<p>Rei knew some of Ranma's story and even though she was putting up with the girl, she had found that she didn't like the girl very much, but her grandfather seemed to like the her and she was a hard worker so she would keep her mouth shut, for now. Just followed along behind them and wondered where this would go, Ranma didn't talk about her life previous to coming here and what she had heard was total crap. Who in the world believed in sex changing curses anyway? Rei wanted proof before she would accept that, unlike her grand father, and hoped things would work out before this wild card became a danger to the Scouts.<p>"Ranma I watched that fight and could tell you were using Anything Goes Martial Arts Style. Genma Saotome practices every morning and I have watched him on a number of occasions, you use the same moves and stances."<p>Ranma scowled. "Miss. Tendo, Genma used to be my father, but he abandoned me in China after I received my curse."<p>"So you are Ranma Saotome, did you know about the promise that our fathers made twenty or so years ago about uniting the two schools of Anything Goes? Or the fact that he says you abandoned him?"<p>"No, but I'm not surprised either, pops never was one to let a meal ticket go. He probably just promised that to get some free food or something. After all I was engaged to several other girls by the idiot, why would your family be any different?"<p>"Other Engagements?"<p>"Eight that I know of currently, pops was always hungry for one reason or another."<p>"I didn't know all this, your father wants to find you so you could fulfill the promise between our houses." Nabiki said and recalled that the panda had just said he wanted to find his son since this was a matter of family honor she had taken it upon herself to do the job.<p>"I gave up my family name Miss. Tendo, Ranma Saotome doesn't exist anymore, pops killed 'him' in China when he tossed me in that spring."<p>"Why don't you change back, it can't be that bad, at least your still human."<p>Ranma let off a bitter laugh that startled both Nabiki and Rei. "He didn't tell you did he, that figures, it was always his way to tell stories to make himself out to be the one that could do no wrong. There were a number of springs in that valley that were covered with wood and blocked off with a fence. When pops jumped out of the panda spring, he backhanded me at full strength and nearly broke my jaw. It sent me flying into one of these blocked off springs and shattered the boards like they didn't even exist, the spring was a permanent girl spring, there is no way to change back. I was so mad that he had taken my manhood away from me that I booted him clear out of the valley, it took me a long time to calm down. Even then I found that after repeated dowsing with hot water from the guide were useless, I can't change back."<p>Nabiki nodded and filled that information away for future study if she needed it. "You said Mr. Saotome abandoned you?"<p>"I traveled around for a few weeks while I contemplated Seppuku, I eventually ruled that out and went back for the fool. He is my father and I couldn't just leave him to suffer by himself so I back tracked and found him in this Amazon village near Jusenkyo, in a cage, but when I tried to talk to him he would just pull out these signs and ask who I was, or why there was this funny sound in the air, just like he did when he didn't want to talk to me before Jusenkyo. Eventually he got angry and told me that his son was dead and that he didn't know who I was."<p>Nabiki and Rei were gasped, no wonder Ranma had given up her family name. Genma had disowned him. "Just because you were no longer a male?" Nabiki asked.<p>Ranma nodded and sipped some of the tea that Rei had laid out before they came inside from the fight. "I tried to reason with him, but he was adamant about it so I talked to the Amazons and made one last deal to save my father. You see he had been tried and enslaved by them for crimes like stealing and back talking to them. You see the Amazons only respect women, when it come so men they take a obey or die mentality, of the few men I saw in the village most were broken men who couldn't think for themselves. Luckily I had been upgraded as they put it and were willing to tolerate me. Pops thinks women are weak and stupid and that they are useless, that they must always be protected in one form or another. He was constantly putting them and their ways down and he pissed off a good number of them in the short time he was there. I had to challenge one of their best to a fight and just survive to make sure they didn't kill him."<p>"What happened?" Nabiki asked.<p>"The fight was a brutal one, their toughest fighter was a girl named Shampoo and she is a stubborn as I am. We started fighting at noon and continued pounding each other for several hours, jumping all over the village and launching Ki attacks at each other. Those were my downfall though, she had several in her arsenal while I only had one and that barely controllable even then. She had this punching technique that allowed her to hit me hundreds of time in seconds, it worked on her kicks too and she eventually took me down with them. Fortunately they were impressed that I lasted as long as I did and they offered me a position as an Amazon. I even know of a technique in my own school of martial arts that can do the same thing, but hadn't had time to master it at the time."<p>"An Amazon?"<p>"I turned them down though because I don't agree with some of their laws, eventually they got me to agree to be an ally of the village instead. After that I spent about four months in the village being trained by the Elder War Masters. I later found out that the technique I mentioned was actually one of theirs and if I had used it they would have hunted me down and killed me to protect their secrets."<p>"Ranma, you've never mentioned any of this stuff to me before." Rei nearly yelled.<p>"Rei, you have made it pretty obvious you don't like me for some reason and I figured you didn't want to know. If you really wanted to you could always ask your grandfather since I told him a few days after I moved in here. Let's talk about something else, I don't want to think about this anymore tonight." Ranma said suddenly, looking sad.<p>Nabiki sat back and wondered how much of that was true and false, she felt sorry for Ranma now that she had met her and didn't want to hurt her. She had been thinking that Ranma would be just like her father, a freeloader, thief, and dishonorable slob. This was a totally different person before, the girl's pain was obvious for all to see. Then Nabiki thought of a question that had been running around her head for most of the day.<p>"Ranma, my sister ran into a guy named Ryoga Hibiki this afternoon..."<p>Ranma blinked in surprise at the question and had to think about it for a second to even remember the guy. Then it came to her and she grinned at the lost memories. "Ryoga, I haven't thought of him in years. How's the moron doing anyway?"<p>"He's out to kill you.'<p>Ranma rolled her eyes and scratched the back of her head. "It's not over the bread feud is it?"<p>"Bread feud?"<p>"Yeah, me and him used to fight to get the last piece of bread during lunch time at our old junior high school, I'm better at aerial stuff so I usually won. He didn't like that very much and challenged me to a duel because of it."<p>"He said you ran away like a coward..."<p>Ranma scowled for a second then started to laugh. "Nope, I waited for him for three days to show up, but eventually I had to go. This was just before I went to China and pops decided that I had won since Ryoga had never shown up." Ranma didn't mention that pops had beaten him unconscious to make him leave the area, the girl's didn't need to know that part.<p>"He's cursed, did you know that?" Nabiki said. She wondered what Ranma would say.<p>"Cursed? What does he turn into?"<p>"A girl."<p>"A girl...Permanently?"<p>"Nope, he says it is reversible."<p>"Knowing him, he probably blames it on me too..."<p>"Wrong again Ranma, your father is the one that did it some how."<p>"Oh..." Ranma smirked as an idea hit him. "I bet pops was trying to use him to replace me for some stupid scheme or another..."<p>Nabiki gasped, that was what was wrong with what Ryoga had been saying, that last piece of the puzzle, she slammed her head against the table for not seeing it sooner, it was so obvious too! She slammed her head down a few more times and sighed, the panda had lost his son and had a deal to keep with her father. Solution, find a replacement and trick or blackmail some poor schmuck into doing what you want. Ranma and Rei grabbed her and made sure she didn't do that any more. "Sorry about that, but I should have seen that right off the bat, I'm usually pretty good at figuring these things out."<p>"Don't do that anymore Miss. Tendo, I don't want you to get hurt anymore and I think you've had enough for today."<p>"Just call me Nabiki, okay?"<p>Ranma sighed in relief. "Thanks, because of the way I was raised I don't have much of a social background. The Amazons helped with that and a number of other areas that pop's had failed to teach me as we were on the road, they had to go to some pretty extreme lengths to cure me of my bad faults."<p>"That's okay Ranma, your a lot different than what I was expecting."<p>"Oh?"<p>"Yeah, I thought you would be just like your father."<p>"No way, I haven't been like the old man since he tried to teach me the Neko-ken."<p>"Well, that is good to know. What is the Neko-ken?"<p>"Dig a pit, tie a young kid of five or so in fish sausage links, and fill the pit with starving cats (shudder as she recalls the training), and drop kid in pit. Make sure he doesn't have a way to escape and wait. Repeat until kid masters the Neko-ken or dies. It originally gave me a deadly fear of cats, luckily I was able to get over that fear with the help of a friend a few weeks ago."<p>"That's insane!" Rei yelled. She didn't like Ranma all that much, but what kind of could she have led to have been tortured this much? Even she felt a little sympathy for the red head, no wonder she was so strange.<p>Ranma shrugged. "Luckily some one helped me to find a way to over come the Neko-ken and get over most of my fears. Though I do tend to have flashbacks and some of the fear if I'm startled."<p>"Ranma, I had thought your father was an idiot, this goes into child abuse and criminal conduct. He should be in jail for doing that to you..."<p>"Pops is an idiot, but he has his moments, just like anybody else Nabiki."<p>"He should be arrested Ranma..."<p>"He is my father, no mater what he may think about me, I am still a student of Anything goes."<p>"Maybe, but he did disown you."<p>Ranma smiled and Nabiki blushed for some odd reason, it confused her. "Yep, but he never said I was thrown out of the school."<p>"Are you going to come back to Nerima with me?"<p>"Why?"<p>"Maybe to talk to your father an see if he still wants to ignore you? He did ask me to find you."<p>"I don't know..."<p>"Ranma, you should go, it will give you a chance to reconcile with your father. My mother is dead and my father ignores me until he needs me to so something, then he pops up to make me do it. You should take whatever chance you have to make things better with your family." Rei said. She had doubts about it, but maybe there was a chance for them to reconcile or something, plus it would get her out of her shrine for a few days.<p>"I don't know...I just wanted to stay away from the idiot..."<p>"Please Ranma?" Nabiki asked.<p>Even turned into a girl, Ranma just couldn't turn a girl down when they turned a pair of large, sparking, pleading eyes on her with out folding. Nabiki did this and Ranma crumpled like a leaf and sighed. "Fine, but I can't promise anything."<p>"Great!" Rei said as she jumped up and ran for Ranma's room. "I'll help you pack."<p>"What was that about?" Nabiki asked.<p>"Got me, she has been mad at me since the day I first arrived here. I'd better tell Grandpa Hino that I'm going to be out of town for a few days. I don't think this is a good idea Nabiki, but I am willing to give it one more try before I cut off all my ties with the idiot. He did raise me for sixteen years." Ranma said and stood up. "While I'm getting ready to head out, do you want to use the shower while your hear to clean up from that monster?"<p>"Thanks, I didn't want to just ask you about that."<p>"That's alright, I don't have much use for formalities and stuff. Here, I'll show you the way."<p>After dropping the girl off in the bathroom and showing her were the towels and cleaning stuff was Ranma headed back to her room. She stepped in and walked over to the bed to sit down. Rei hadn't started packing her things yet which surprised Ranma a bit, she had seemed excited to get her out of the shrine. At the foot of the bed was satisfied red cat, calmly buffing her claw and grinning evilly.<p>"I wonder what happened to Rei?" Ranma muttered.<p>"She stopped by a few minutes ago and tried to pack your things, but I showed her the error of her ways." Ito said.<p>"Did she tell you that I'm going to be gone for a few days?"<p>"What?" Ito screamed and started hissing, her red hair standing on end. "You mean all that stuff she said was true? Your abandoning your Royal court to go off to some town with out protection or anything?"<p>Ranma gave the cat a half lidded look. "What do I need with a body guard, cat?"<p>"You are the Princess of the Moon, that's what!" Ito yelled.<p>"Wake up cat, I ain't no princess of anything, I got roped into this gig because of those damned springs and I refuse to believe that I am some reincarnated princess from some fairy tail kingdom or another. It sounds to much like a story line from some manga or anime."<p>"So you don't consider your self a Magical Girl?" Ito asked snidely.<p>"Of course not, why do you ask that?"<p>"Only because of what a Magical Girl is, a young good looking girl that has a magical item that gives her powers, a revealing costume, and a cute and adorable side kick, that's what!"<p>"Um...so what, it doesn't have anything to do with me." Ranma said as she crossed her arms and nodded, cutely. She refused to accept this no matter what she had been told or had done otherwise.<p>Ito face faulted off the edge of the bed. "BAKA, those bracers are the magical items, the costume makes you a magical girl, and I'm your cute animal side kick!" Ito ranted.<p>"Cute side kick? Hah, more like a large red bull's-eye!"<p>Ito snarled and leapt at Ranma, who giggled nervously and attached herself to the ceiling, again and stuck her tongue out at the hissing cat as it jumped up and down in an attempt to get her with it's claws. Outside the rooms window Luna was rolling on the ground laughing her feline butt off at the sight. She had stopped by to talk to Ranma about what she had done to Usagi a few days before, it hadn't been at all nice. She would have been here that night to give Ranma a piece of her mind, but she had been under Usagi's bed giggling for most of the night.<p>**********<p>Ending Notes - Check out my new site at .com/BookmarkBlvd/crose9/<p>This chapter has gone through several revisions in the past weeks to help correct some of the mistakes I made in past chapters. As it goes on I have found it increasingly hard to bring in much of the Nerima crew except as small parts So I came up with this to settle some things.. I also brought in Ranma's mother in this chapter, but she still has no clue who or what may have happened to her son since she recieved the post card. This will be dealt with slowly as I get closer to her first appearance in the core story line, but I have some plans for her that will alter her in strange ways.<p>Jedite had failed once to often and is now on the ropes with only one more chance to live or die.
