</div>Notes - The very first thing I have to do before we get started is to bow down and apologies for the amount of time it took to get this out. Nearly two months, way to long for a fan fic chapter. My excuse is Writers Block, I've got a major case of the dreaded disease and it has affected every thing I've tried to do over the last little while. All of my stories are suffering because of it.<p>**********<br/>Princess of the Moon<br/>Chapter 07<br/>By Cory D. Rose<p>(c)2002<p>The old man sat in the middle of the stone floor with a tiny amount of his aura flaring around him to provide light, weak didn't even come close to describing how he felt just then. He had been in here for some time, how long he didn't know, but it had been several years at least. Luckily he had learned long ago how to supplement his energies through several different ways, he could go months without real food, though every now and then he did have to eat something. What was even worse was that he spent more time asleep than he did awake, his energies were so low that he barely had enough to get by at times. He looked around and lashed out to grab one of the rats that tended to explore the interior of the cave every week or so, he held it in his hand and cooked it with his Ki and ate the thing.<p>Those two fools that had sealed him in here had taken steps that even surprised him, because of his 'habits' Hopposai had developed a weakness he hadn't considered when he began supplementing his Ki so many years before. They hadn't even known about it when they sealed him in here, just a set of lucky guesses that proved to be his undoing. They had spent the day running though the local villages and getting supplies in the usual way, Hopposai had always believed in the 'why pay when it's just sitting there' style of reprovisioning and made sure his students knew all the different ways to do so.<p>When he got out of here he would take steps to make sure something like this could never happen again, but to do so would take some time. His downfall was because of his fear of dying, everything he did was to make sure he wouldn't kick the bucket when he hadn't even had a chance to train an heir, those two fools had been his third try at an heir and they had failed miserably. They had such promise in the beginning, tons of untapped Ki potential and the kind of determined will that suited his school to a tee. Hopposai sighed, it was his own fault for turning them into what they were, he knew that and couldn't really blame them for doing this to him. It wasn't like he hadn't treated them any better than slaves at times or intentionally pushed them over the edge of madness to accomplish his goals.<p>He tossed the rat bones across the cave into the small pile that had collected over time, as it landed he heard a thunder clap and knew it was raining again, the bone bounced and hit the large stone that sealed his cave and was vaporized when it touched the spirit ward that was wrapped around it. In his weakened condition there was no way he could even touch the stone let along move it. Those idiots has sealed him in here like an evil spirit and much to Hopposai's surprise the damned thing actually worked, one little touch and he would be drained of all his energy and killed a few seconds later. He could feel the thing's power over him whenever he even considered trying to get out by other means.<p>Those two idiot had made a mistake that had taken him some time to figure out, though it was mostly just guesses. They had gotten him drunk as gourd, tied him in a barrel of hooch and tossed him and several of the other barrel of alcohol into the cave with a couple stick so of dynamite. Even that hadn't been enough to really take him out for more than a few minutes, that that damned spirit ward had been his downfall. He hadn't even considered what it was when he woke up in a pile of rubble and nearly leveled even more of the cave in his rage. Then he had tapped the boulder to shatter it and found himself in a state of shock some days later when he came to with barely enough energy to think.<p>Three hundred years, that was how long he had been alive and he felt ever minute of his great age as he sat there gazing balefully at the ward that kept him imprisoned. His Ki wasn't truly his anymore, more like a mix of the hundreds of different beings that he had drained a little from over the years. In the eyes of the spirits that made him into a kind of vampire, though he didn't consider himself to be one, those wards proved him wrong time and again. Thunder rumbled again and he started in surprise as a few rocks were shaken loose and rained down on his head.<p>"That must be one hell of a storm out there if it's producing thunder that strong." He mumbled.<p>Then he looks up at the roof of the cave as he felt the build up of power high above him in the clouds, his eyes narrowed. Because of the ward he couldn't reach out with his aura to 'see' what was going on, but he could feel it inside the cave. Something was about to change and he knew it involved it him in someway, a grin spread over his face. His eyes light up with power as his aura flares out to fill the cave, he couldn't alter things outside the cave, but mother nature's power was a thousand times more powerful than any ward and he could play off that little weakness. There was a little trick he had picked up about fifty years back, it hadn't been all that useful in a fight because it took to long to set up and just the right conditions, but it helped with perfecting aura control and building one's power.<p>His aura seeped into the rocks and he started to concentrate even harder as he gave the rock around him a bit of a push. Over the years he had been witness to several morons fighting battles in the rain with live steel, for some reason some of these idiots had been struck by a bolt of lightning and slagged their precious swords. This is what had given him the idea for this technique, but it's slow build up and hard to control shaping made it a pain in the ass. Outside the cave the rain washed across the front of the cave and the rock seemed to develop a light mist that clung to rocks, it spread out and seemed to shape itself around the ward stone. Sweat dripped off Hopposai's brow, if this didn't work he would be stuck here for a several more years before the could try something like this again.<p>The ward flared with ethereal energy and an evil grin spread across Hopposai's face as the felt the energy high up in the clouds sync with his own, he clenched his fist and flared up even brighter. It was with almost a sigh that he felt the lightning launch itself out of the clouds, the wards were supposed to protect against even natural disasters, but Hopposai knew he had succeeded in his goal a few seconds later as the bolt fell of the sky and struck the ward. The stone exploded inward and smacked him against the back of the cave, but that wasn't enough to keep him down as he crawled out of the cave and breathed the sweet taste of freedom for the first time in years.<p>"Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!" Hopposai laughed evilly as he staggered to his feet and raised his hands to the sky in triumph.<p>Only to be struck down by his own trick as another lightning bolt hit him in the head and sent him back down, but a few seconds later Hopposai was back up and staggering down the side of the mountain in glee, dodging lightning bolts all the way.<p>"BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!"<p>**********<p>Screams of rage filled the night air and startled little kids out of their sleep and set off the family dogs. A shadow like blur laughed to itself as it ran through the shadows with what appeared to be a huge bag on it's back. It looked behind itself and cackles as it lands on a fence to watch some of the advancing hord of angry females close in on him with all manor of weapons, from brooms, to small hand held rocket launchers, baring down on it and reaches into it's bag. He pulls out what look like a pair of silky blue panties and pats his face with them for a second before he puts them back in his jacket and bounds forward into the pack of angry females. He cackles happily as he catches the surprised girl off guard by diving under her broom attack, rebounding off the pavment, and pressing his face right beween her ample breasts. He had relived her of her bra some time ago and was reaping the rewards of that act now.<p>"Pervert!"<p>"They're so firm!"<p>"Kill him!"<p>"So BOUNCY!"<p>"Maim him!"<p>"SO FULLY PACKED!<p>"I'll eviscerate him!"<p>"HOOCHA!"<p>"Die!<p>"So many pretty ladies!"<p>"Aghaaaaaaaaaa!"<p>"BWHAHAHAHAHAH!"<p>And so Hopposai spent another eventful night playing with assed by a group of guys to show off their charms and well endowed assets. This was the life, the thrill of the hunt and all the noises the girls made as the night went on made him feel all warm and fuzzy inside. There were nights that he hours on end doing this and laughing the whole time, he loved his life.<p>He looked up when he passed a school clock tower and noted that it was getting a little late. So he hopped up on roof where none of the lovelies could get him, waved goodbye and bounced off. The girls slid to a halt and glared at the bane of their existence and gasped for air as he disappeared. They all turned on their heals and walked off, just as Hopposai reappeared and gave them all a goodbye hug for good luck and finished stripping them of garters, slips, and pantyhose cackling the whole time. They screeched in rage swarmed over him like a pack of rabid wolves, but the old man was much to fast for them and got away without being hit, that was a good night!<p>Ten minutes later Hopposai landed on top of a house in the middle of the resident district and sat down, leaning against one of the upraised portions of the roof. He sat his sack down and pulled out a pipe, filled it with tobacco and lit it with a burst of Ki energy from the tip of his finger. He spent several minutes relaxing and thinking about what he was going to do from here on out. It had only been a couple of weeks since he managed to get free of that damned cave and make his way into the nearest city for a quick recharge. Those two students of his had hurt him, but he wasn't all that mad at them since he had been using them as his own personal slaves for some time before they rebelled and this hadn't been the first time, just the most successful.<p>He would get them back, but they wouldn't know it until he was ready to strike. The only problem was how? Should he use a demon or some kind of rare herb mixed in with their food? There were so many possibilities to choose from, three hundred years had given him a lot of knowledge to call upon. The demon was out since he didn't wasn't to kill them and they were pathetic when it came to fighting them off. The herb idea was looking a little better, but it didn't really have his kind of flare to it. He wanted them to know it was him when the time was right, so something else would have to be used.<p>A few puffs on his pipe helped him think of a few more possibilities, but they were all flawed in some way. He could kidnap their wives and children and 'train' them in their place for a while, but girls were hard to control once they knew how to defend against him. Destroying their reputations would work, but as students of his school that didn't amount to much either. The whole point was to defend and fight against anything that came along, so something else would have to be used against them. He kept coming back to their children and recalled that Genma had a son at one time and had been planning to take him on a training trip just before him and Soun had sealed him in that cave. Hopposai recalled that poor Soun had been cursed with nothing but girls for children as well. He wondered if they were still around the area and what they were doing ten years later?<p>They would have only been six or so the last time he was around and probably wouldn't remember him in any way. Could he find and use them in his plans in some way that he hadn't considered yet? Yes, that had a lot of possibilities and if he worked it right another chance to find an heir for his style. So long as they had the right attitude anyway, he didn't want to deal with any punk kids that would get in his way whenever they could though, so he would have to be careful if he used the plan. If he went along with it he had the necessary materials to brainwash them if need be, so he wasn't all that worried. Now that he had the basics of a plan he needed to find them, that would the hardest part.<p>Tapping his pipe out and putting it away, he adjusted his hat and picked up his back pack as he jumped to the street below. He hopped along for several minutes than smirked as he spotted a telephone booth sitting innocently on the edge of a street corner, someone inside talking to someone. He hopped inside, booted the occupant out and into the bushes, and opened the phone book. It took all of five minutes to find Soun Tendo listed in Nerima, complete with his address. Genma on the other hand wasn't in there, but his wife was. Nodoka Saotome was registered in Jubaan and it would be easy enough to get there by train.<p>"Hey you old geezer, I'm going to make you pay for that!" Yelled the guy as he pulled himself out of the bushes. "AGHAAAAAAAAAA!" Only to find himself flying through the air above the trees as the old man tapped his wrist with that pipe of his.<p>"Punk kid, respect your elders!" Hopposai yelled as he bounced out of the phone booth and down the street.<p>He had never thought much of Nodoka Saotome, but she had been the one Genma chose for his grand 'plan' and he hadn't been able to dispute her family background. She had been the unofficial heir to their nearly extinct Devil Hunting legacy and getting that magical and physical potential into his son had been a great idea. Genma had asked him for advice on the best way to pull it off and he had told him to just have a family and not to worry about taking off and abandoning his wife. The way Hopposai figured it, Genma would have an easy life and free access to all the sex he wanted, a win-win situation in his book. The old fool had ignored him though and went to his so called brother.<p>There was a man that Hopposai kept at a distance, for some reason the bastard just rubbed him the wrong way. What had his name been again? Gensa, Genshi...oh yeah, Gendo Saotome. The man was like a spider, always moving among the shadows and pulling strings to get what he wanted. A couple of years before the two fools had buried him in that cave Gendo had been working for the Yakuza and others, rising among the ranks at an impossible rate of speed. The man was a natural 'under the table' leader and absolutely ruthless in his dealings with anyone that even thought to cross him.<p>Gendo and Genma had always worked together to get what they wanted, but Hopposai could remember the few times that Gendo had sold out his own brother for one reason or another. Genma had never picked up on it and gotten away because of those sealed techniques of his, but he had also gone straight back to his brother like the moron he is, always ready for more abuse to further his goals. Hopposai wondered what had happened to those two after all these years and if he would have to deal with Gendo to get is revenge on Genma? If anyone deserved to have demon sent after them it was Gendo Saotome, the man wasn't just evil, he was an evil to be disposed of as soon as possible.<p>With Nerima being the closest to his current location, he decided to pay old Soun a visit he would never forget and see if his skill were still up to stuff. Genma may have outclassed him in raw talent, but Soun had his own skills that had been able to let him hold his own against Genma in the few sparring matches they had been in. Genma had always been one for the air and trained in it exclusively while Soun had specialized in the ground attack version of his Anything Goes. If the two had ever thought to mix their schools and learn from each other they would have taken the first step the needed for him to take them serious as students. Unfortunately their small minds hadn't thought of it and that had ended any possible chance of him ever continuing their training.<p>So much potential and all of it wasted for their own petty goals, he had seen it happen on more than one occasion, but if they weren't going to work together it was their own damn fault. They had crimes to pay for and he planned to take it out of their hides the first chance he got, hopefully they had spent the last few years training. He wanted a challenge, not a couple of whimpering cowards, but if he remembered right they usually fell to their knees the instant they saw him. That little reaction would be fun to exploit too, they deserved nothing less than the total humiliation that only he could bring them.<p>**********<p>Ranma stretched as she ran though her afternoon kata in the back yard of the shrine like she did almost every day, there was a light breeze blowing across the tops of the trees around her. Letting her mind roam as she moved, she thought about what she would have to do later tonight. That fool Jedite had challenged them to a duel, but she didn't think the other girls had it in them to fight the guy. So far they had proven they could take on the low level monsters with ease, but when it came to the Generals the girls were lacking in the needed power. Jedite was getting stronger with every fight as well, continually drawing on more and more just to make sure he survived the fight. Ranma knew that she had nearly had him during their last fight, but he had gotten away at the last moment and she wasn't even sure how. Sure he had teleported off the ship, but he usually created a gate of some kind and jumped through it.<p>The teleport effect had been swirling flower petals of some kind and not the expected portal, she figured that meant that he'd had help getting away after they killed that last monster of his. A while later he had shown up looking pissed off, healthy, and challenged them to a fight to the death. Ranma didn't want to place the girls in that kind of danger even if this was exactly what they were supposed to fight, they just didn't have the skills to do it and she blamed herself for that, she should have been training them from day one. The only person that even seemed interested in learning from her wasn't even a Scout, but a new friend named Makoto Kino. Ami preferred to study while she had the chance and didn't want to learn how to fight at the moment, Usagi was a great friend, but a pathetic fighter and it showed in her actions. Rei was more interested in trying to find a way to throw her out of the Shrine than learning from her, that still baffled Ranma to some degree, as far as she could tell things weren't that bad between them.<p>Rei's reaction didn't really bother Ranma all that much though, she didn't consider herself to be this mysterious princess that Ito and Luna were always calling her. A stupid moon symbol on the forehead wasn't enough proof in her book anyway, though she did know that it appeared when she started to draw on her full power. Ranma had been avoiding thinking about her situation for some time now because she wasn't sure what to do about it. Ito had been trying to get her to accept it since day one, but even if she had accepted being female, being a Princess was a whole new headache she didn't want. Sailor Pluto had tricked her by using her pride and honor against her and look where it had landed her.<p>In a stupid outfit and with a set of powers that had sent her into orgasmic bliss the three times she had transformed. Ranma thought it must have been some 'gift' given to the princess' of the past, all it did was make her wary of the transformation. Pluto has said that it would get less and less over time, but transforming still bothered her. Being reminded of the transformation set her on edge, but she was getting better. Ignoring her situation was the easiest way to deal with it, but every now and then she would be forcibly reminded of it, like when she became a Sailor or had her new sex shoved down her throat by her father. Her and Nabiki had talked about it and she knew that Rei, Ito, and Luna were privy to the secret, but it was a secret she wanted to get rid of. Oh, and Genma too, the bastard had no problem telling anyone so long as it was lie that put him in a better light.<p>Ranma smirked to herself, the old man was an asshole though and through because of his outdated values and plans, but he knew how to teach someone how to fight well beyond normal and it was one of the few things that helped her to survive what had happened to her. She had learned to out think the old man and beat the training from hell, though how anyone could have predicted Jusenkyo was a mystery to her. Even if she had known how to speak fluent Mandarin when she arrived, she still wouldn't have believed the Guide. Who in there right minds would believe in magic, until Jusenkyo she had scoffed at the idea just like her old man did and paid the price for it.<p>She was in a female body with a male mind and this was causing her to give this fight with Jedite a different look. A portion of her was willing to take the girls with her, but another portion, the male portion that she was desperately trying to maintain at all costs wanted to protect them and leave them behind where it was be safe. If she did this though it would be like insulting them in a major way and they trusted her to do the right thing since she was supposed to be this fabled Princess. It was enough to make Ranma gag, she had been a loner for her entire life, but she had learned that being female was different than male. Girls liked to be in the thick of things, at least she did and most everyone she had met was the same. So even now they were about to gather out in the front room of the Shrine and get ready for their fight with Jedite and she didn't want to take them into danger.<p>Even during her time on the team she had never actually taken the girls into a fight, but shown up during the battle, letting the others do what they needed and adding her abilities in where needed. This situation was something she didn't like, but it came down to a few simple facts. Keeping the fight on a one to one level was nearly impossible because of the way Jedite had challenged them, the whole city knew where it was going to take place and who was to be there. The police would be there to stop anyone from even getting near the place let alone even entering Haneda Airport, even them, because they wanted to protect the city from the potential destruction that could be caused by the fight. If she left the girls here and took him on alone they would still know where to find her. Ranma just didn't know what to do, fighting was all she knew and her father had taught her things like tactics and how to read a situation so that she wouldn't be wasting time during the fight. Oh sure he had other names for it, like 'don't be an idiot and do it this way' and 'you pathetic wimp, why are you wasting your time with that?'.<p>The old man had always had a flair for words that ticked her off in a matter of seconds, but over the years she had learned to out think the old man and adapt his training to a higher purpose. Coming to a stop Ranma grabbed a towel and wiped the sweat off her face and arms, she still had a hold on her Ki though. This was an area that she was having problems with, no matter how much time spent on practice she just couldn't master the things Cologne had shown her. Forming the energy into different shapes was very difficult, the old woman had said she would get it eventually and when she did she would be well on her way to mastering her Ki. As the weeks passed she had practiced for a few hours a day and even though she had grown more skilled in her control, mastering the technique was still out of the question. Making even one change more than twice gave her a head ache, doing more than that split her concentration in too many directions to keep control.<p>"Ranma?" Ito, in human form, walked into the area where Ranma was practicing and looked around. "Why are you out her in the dark, I can barely see anything and you're always out here way into the night practicing."<p>"Dark?" Ranma mumbled and looked around. "It not that dark out here Ito, there's still plenty of light to see by."<p>"Ranma, it's almost ten at night and you're in the middle of the woods where over head lightning isn't available. I can only see because of my cat eyesight that transfers over to this form."<p>Ranma blinked and looked around a little more, as far as she could tell everything was clear enough to see details. She had thought that it was still early and was about to go in and take a shower before everyone showed up and left for the fight. She turned to check the suns position and had to keep a gasp of surprise to herself as she realized that Ito was telling the truth, the sun wasn't even visible in the sky. She knew where it was, had always known where it was no matter where she was at the time, but this went way beyond what she thought of as normal. "What the hell?"<p>"Ito, you forget that on top of being our Princess, Ranma is also Sailor Sun and is constantly drawing her powers from it even while untransformed." Luna said as she walked over, she was still in cat form. "Sorry, I was running a little behind Ito and heard the conversation."<p>"This is because of those Sailor powers?" Ranma snapped. "I feel like the sun is just on the horizon, providing just enough light to see perfectly."<p>"You are connected to the sun and gain a lot of your energy from it Ranma, eventually when you master the power you should be a force to be reckoned with. It will just take a long time to adapt your body to the full power of the transformation Sailor Sun."<p>"I thought I told you not to call me that Luna?" Ranma growled.<p>"It's your title Princess." Luna said stubbornly.<p>"I said I would come up with a new name, something more in keeping with these modern times. It will still be a sun type name, but a single word instead this ridiculous Sailor Sun crap."<p>"So what did you come up with Ranma?" Ito asked, trying to distract Luna from losing her temper. Ranma had been driving the black cat up a wall lately with her refusal to fall in line like the other girls.<p>"I haven't decided just yet, but have a few in mind so I'll have one picked out by the time I get to Haneda Airport. When will the girls start showing up anyway?"<p>"They're here already, that was the reason I came out here. To bring you in so that you could talk to the girls and come up with the best plan of attack." Ito said.<p>"Oh that's easy."<p>"What would that be?"<p>"I'm going alone."<p>"What?" Said to voices that seemed to dislike the idea.<p>"I'm going there without them, the girls aren't ready to take on Jedite alone."<p>"Are you insane!" Luna yelled.<p>"I've defeated him three times so far, I can do it again and this time he won't be running away."<p>"You need their help Ranma, you can't do everything on your own, not in this situation." Luna snarled.<p>"They are not up to fighting a General, they are fine for the lesser monsters, but Jedite is out of the question."<p>This was a first for Luna, she had been dealing with Usagi for so long that she hadn't yet come up against Ranma's stubborn streak, well except for that one time when the girl had leveled that Ki blade at her and threatened her life. Ito had tried to explain that Ranma needed special handling, but Luna had just huffed and figured Ito didn't know how to deal with her charge. She hadn't thought of this though. "Ranma you can't do this, it will hurt their feelings and cause distrust on the team."<p>"How can you expect me to just take them into danger like that Luna, they are barely trained in their powers. They spend more time going to the park, movies, and each other's houses than they do training how to use their powers. I work with mine on a daily basis, spending a few hours a day pushing myself beyond my limits."<p>"You have to treat them fairly Ranma, at the moment they are your personal guard and there to protect you when you need it. You many not like that, but it's the way this is done and had been done for some time. If you don't like the way things are done, get out there and start training them a little at a time. They are only fourteen years old Ranma, you're two years older than them and should know better than this." Luna snapped.<p>"Since when are they my responsibility." Ranma growled.<p>"You are the Princess Ranma, get over it and move on to the next problem."<p>"Luna, I understand that part, but you expect me to stand here and believe that I have the right to tell them what to do because I'm this stupid princess idea you keep harping about? Get real, this is the real world not some imaginary Kingdom full of nobility and magic. There are five of us counting the green haired lady, that doesn't make up a Kingdom!"<p>"Lady Pluto isn't a green haired lady, Ranma." Ito said tiredly.<p>"Whatever! Luna, Jedite is usually out here to steal energy and place people in the hospital, this time he is out to actually kill them."<p>"He's out to kill you too!"<p>"I have trained for over ten years to protect myself, I'm willing to die in combat if need be, those girls aren't even close to being able to make a decision like that."<p>Ranma was about to continue the argument when she felt a presence enter the small glade and turned to look as Tuxedo Mask stepped out of the shadows. His black and gray out fit cloaking him almost perfectly, even giving him a bit of a noble out look, though he still looked ridiculous to Ranma. "What do you want?"<p>"The girl is right Princess, the Scouts were fighting this evil off long before you showed up. It started with Moon doing it alone, something she really didn't, and still doesn't want to do, but she is knows that if she gives up people will be hurt."<p>"She doesn't talk about that time to much, just how thankful she is to have others around her so that she doesn't have to do this alone anymore." Luna said. She didn't trust Tuxedo Mask, but hoped he might be able to sway the Princess from this foolhardy decision.<p>Mask also leveled his cane at Ranma and frowned. "Your skills are considerable Princess, but you can not take on this evil alone. Moon couldn't do it when she started, nor could she do it when she had the help of the blue haired Mercury. It wasn't until Mars showed up that that they got the needed fire power to stand against Jedite's evil, then you showed up and made things worse."<p>"Excuse me?" Ranma snarled at Tuxedo Mask.<p>"Jedite started to use more of his power than he did in those earlier fights, after you showed up, he started to take more of an interest in you and has become a lot more dangerous because of it. At this moment the girl's can't face him as they are, but neither can you unless you can find more power than you already possess."<p>"Don't you dare lecture me Penguin, I've had to suffer through more years of hell than you can possibly conceive of to reach the level I'm at now." Ranma snarled and clenched her fists.<p>"I know you can not take this man on alone Princess, he has made plans to kill all of you and you're planning to walk into it without back up?" Mask's tone was almost condescending in it's disbelief.<p>Ranma controlled her anger though will power alone, no one implied that she was weak without paying for it, no one, not after what she has been through. "So your saying I should just take those three untrained and vulnerable girls into a known trap, it would be a better idea if I just gave up my life to stop him than all of us doing so."<p>Mask leveled a glare at Ranma. "I have my reasons for knowing this, if you go alone you will fail, if those girls go with you there is a much better chance of winning."<p>"Princess." Ito said as she stepped forward, she had heard of the infamous Tuxedo Mask, but hadn't ever had a chance to see or even meet the man. His cloaking spell was enough to hide his identity from her, just like the normal scouts, but there was something familiar about him that she couldn't place. "In this case he is right, the team will win if you give them the chance, or you will fail if you go alone."<p>"What if they die?" Ranma yelled at Ito.<p>"Then they will have died doing their duty Ranma, they are inexperienced, but it's way to late to do anything about it now. You will need to leave within the hour and they need to be with you, or Jedite will win."<p>Ranma's glare turned back on Mask and if anything, it got even colder. "If they go you will do as you have been doing Tuxedo Mask, you will protect them to the best of your ability."<p>Tuxedo Mask didn't say a word or even nod as he stepped into a shadowed night around him and vanished. Ranma ignored him, something in her said that he would do just as she had ordered. He always showed up to the fights, though rarely participated in any way other than to throw some tripe words at the girls to encourage them. Like the girls, he seemed to depend more on his power than his skills, though she could tell that he had a little hand to hand skill and Kendo skill from the way he was holding the cane. She turned back to the cats and sighed.<p>"I hope you are right, I really don't want to lead these girls to their deaths tonight."<p>"They are stronger than you think they are Ranma." Luna said. "Let's head back to the house."<p>"You head on ahead Luna, I want to pick up the rest of my stuff, I'll be in to take a shower in a few minutes."<p>"Okay Ranma." Luna said and walked off.<p>Once she was out of sight Ranma quickly collected her stuff and put them in a gym bag she had sitting nearby. "Ito, what is your opinion of Mask? Something was off about him, as if he was trying to hide something."<p>"He's not all there."<p>"Huh?"<p>"His eyes were intense, but at the same time they were completely blank. It was as if a whole portion of his mind wasn't working, he wasn't all there."<p>"You think he's crazy?"<p>"Crazy?"<p>"Yeah, if he's not all there that means that he could turn into a threat when he does become whole again."<p>"No, he's not crazy, but we don't know his motives and that could be a problem."<p>"Alright, I can see that. We will have to keep a closer eye on him for the time being, is there anyway to do that without letting him know about it?"<p>"I suppose me or Luna could follow him home or something, but he will keep pulling that disappearing trick."<p>Ranma shrugged. "He's using some kind of magic to mask his movements, I'm not sure how just yet, but it would be a good idea to figure out how he does it."<p>"We can check with Luna's Home Office." Ito said.<p>They started walking back to the Shrine. "What in the world is that?"<p>"Luna has a little help she can call on every now and then, she calls it Home Office, they have a special room under the Arcade that has an access terminal."<p>"Has this place been of any help to the girls?"<p>"A little, according to Luna they helped to find Mercury and Mars."<p>"Hmmm..." Ranma said as they arrived back at the Shrine. "I'll join the others in a few minutes, I need a shower."<p>"Okay." Ito said as she transformed back into a cat and ran inside.<p>Ranma followed her at a slower pace and headed for her room to get a change of clothes and some bath supplies, she wasn't looking forward to this fight, but at least she had a chance to get ready for it. Her old man would have been sneak attacking her around every corner if things had been the way they used to, she still expected it in fact, though not as much as she used to. She just hoped that her life with old man was over for a good long time, things had been settling down lately, even with the Youma attacks and such. Her old man could be a thousand times more irritating with his weird ideas for training, like shackling a hundred kilo lead weight to her leg on a chain and forcing her to fight with the handicap. At least Jedite could be a bit predictable and easy to read, though not as much as he had been.<p>But first, she really needed a shower.<p>**********<p>The door to the run down bar opened up and in walked Gendo Saotome dressed in an old suit that had seen better days. He looked around the sparsely filled run down hole that his brother had decided to use as a meeting place while they were both in the same city. His gaze stopped on some guy across the room who was giving them 'the look'. The one where he thought he had found an easy mark and was about to do something stupid. Gendo's eyes bored into his from twenty feet away and nearly knocked the man over with the look alone. The guy backed up and paled, nearly pissing his pants as he realized that picking on this guy would be a bad idea.<p>From there Gendo continued his look over of the bar until he spotted his brother sitting in the back corner and keeping an eye on everyone in the bar while his back was to the wall. It was a pretty typical position for his brother Genma, the man had managed to piss off quite a few people on his training trip and always had to be on the look out for possible enemies coming at him for revenge. With a smirk Gendo made his way across the bar and watched out of the corner of his eye as the man that had thought about assaulting him scrambled away from him in fear.<p>He adjusted his glasses and sat down at his brother's table and noted the half dozen bottles of beer spread across the table and glazed look in Genma's eyes. They hadn't talked to each other face to face like this in a couple of years now and Gendo almost wished it could have been a little longer. He hated dealing with is worthless excuse of a brother, the man's stupidity was always getting him into one form of trouble or another. Currently Genma was dressed a he always was, in a dirty and thread bare white gi and just beginning to show his age. The scarf on his head looked like it had seen better days as well, but that didn't bother Gendo do much. Genma had begun loosing his hair when he turned thirty and the last ten years hadn't been all that kind to him.<p>"Genma."<p>"Gendo."<p>"What was it you wanted to see me about?"<p>"The boy has done something stupid and managed to get away from me."<p>Gendo kept a flash of anger from spreading to his face and did what was needed to control his temper. "How?"<p>"He ran away."<p>"Why?" Gendo snapped, he had told this fool on hundreds of occasions that treating someone as badly as he did Ranma would be a mistake. It was one of the few things he had never been able to get Genma to back down from.<p>"We were at the last training ground of the trip when he gave up his manhood and vanished off the face of the planet."<p>"Gave up his manhood?"<p>Genma nodded drunkenly.<p>"How did he do that? Did he suddenly turn gay, put on a dress, and change his name to Suzzy?" Gendo growled out. He could see finely crafted plans crumbling around him as he sat there.<p>"I don't know why he did it, but he managed to get away from me while we were finishing up our training."<p>"Where were you training?"<p>"A place in China called Jusenkyo."<p>Gendo nearly fell out of his chair as the name rebounded around his head, he had heard of the place before, but he couldn't recall any details. Only that it was one of the last places on Earth that he had ever wanted to visit, he would need to look up more details on the place later on. "Why did you go there, that place is more dangerous than anything you could ever imagine."<p>"How in the hell was I to know what that place was?" Genma complained and drank some more of his beer. "The place was listed as a dangerous training ground and even had guide books printed with maps on how to get there. I thought it would be perfect for training the boy and inserting more of my control over him."<p>"Idiot! Of all the places to take him, the name of the place should have clued you into just how bad a place that was to take him!" Gendo yelled.<p>"Oh come on, I barely understand Chinese, how was I to know what would happen." Genma complained and drained the rest of his beer. He let off a loud belch, farted, and passed out across the table.<p>Gendo's eyes lit up with hate as he gazed down at his 'brother' and seriously considered killing the moron right then and there. Then he sighed and backed off, Genma was the only family he had left and there were things that he still needed to accomplish if he was to succeed with his long range plans. He pushed his chair back and stood up to glare down at the idiot before him for several seconds before turning on his heel and stalking out of the bar. It was several seconds after the door slammed that Genma's eyes opened and he sat up with a grin.<p>"All to easy 'big' brother." He muttered as he stood and paid his tab at the bar. Getting the bars mad him for stealing was something he didn't do, he liked coming back to drink with his friends.<p>"What was that about Saotome?" Asked the bartender as he rang up Genma's bill.<p>"Just some family business."<p>"You be careful, that one is very dangerous and I wouldn't want to be on his bad side."<p>"True, but Gendo has his uses." Genma said as he turned and took the back way out of the bar. It just to be cautious, but even he knew that to piss off his brother by tricking was as good a way to earn a death warrant as anything else. There wasn't much Gendo could actually do about it though so Genma wasn't all that worried. He had bigger things to worry about, like finding the boy and getting him to fulfill the pact between families, there was a huge amount of money on the line if he pulled this off and he would be set for life.<p>He was about to exit the alley behind the bar when Genma felt his danger sense start to warn him of something. With a curse he turned around and looked into the night darkened space behind him and wondered if his brother had seen through his play acting. He took a defensive stance and glared into the murk around him, but only the silence could be detected. He sent his senses out and wondered if he had made a mistake, then he reacted without thought as a series of chains sailed through the spot he had been standing seconds earlier. He could see the glint of light off the blades at the end of the chains just before they retracted into the darkness around him.<p>"Who's there?" He growled out.<p>"Just me old man." Said a whisper on the wind.<p>Genma snarled as he heard the voice and relaxed slightly, he had dealt with this one on several occasions before this and he knew that this fight wouldn't be any different than the last time. They had been fighting each other for some years now and this guy hadn't yet come even close to killing him no matter how much he tried, though it was always a surprise that he tended to work alone instead of with a team. "I nearly killed you last time, what makes you think this will be different?"<p>"Even a rat can sometimes have a bit of lunch, eh, rat?" Snarled the evil sounding voice, to Genma it was a waste of time.<p>"I'll kill you this time, you have been bothering me for far to long." Genma growled out and began going over his Yama Sen Ken technique's more lethal maneuvers.<p>Silence greeted his statement and Genma as he stood there and looked around, he knew he was going to have to find a better place to fight than an alley in the worst part of town. He spun on his heel and launched himself to a nearby roof with a grunt of effort, he was getting to old for this kind of crap. He took off running along the edge of the roof just as a half dozen throwing spikes slammed into the stone by his feet and exploded, two passed within inches of his nose and shot past his head. This didn't slow him down in any way as he looked off into the distance to look for a better place for them to fight, they had done this enough times to know that wherever that was, the place wouldn't last very long. Both of them were well trained fighters, but this bastard had been trained in ways that allowed him to keep up with him and that little detail had always surprised him. Genma frowned as he looked ahead made out a small area where a bit of construction was in progress, the bare bones of a four story building, it would be perfect for his needs and vulnerable to the Yama Sen Ken special attacks.<p>He was glad it was late at night though, doing what he had planned during the day would have gotten him in a whole lot of trouble he didn't want to deal with right now. With a speed and grace that would have surprised even his friend Soun, Genma jumped from roof to roof with ease, he had learned a lot of things over the years with his son that even Hopposai hadn't ever bothered to teach him. Roof hopping was a skill he'd had to learn after teaching his son the Neko-Ken, the little bastard had taken to running across or over anything that had gotten in his way. Hopposai used the roof's in his little games, but he's never gotten around to teaching him and Soun how to do certain things, instead they'd learned how to create their own types of attacks and work as a team.<p>This is where his Yama Sen Ken and Umi Sen Ken schools had come from, Genma hated to admit that he would never have even come up with the schools if it wasn't for the Hopposai, but it was true non the less. He might have even respected the old Master if he had actually taught them less of his lifestyle and more of the Art itself. Genma was in his early forties now and had developed a bit of a spare tire over the years, but he was still in pretty good shape for his years on the road. Now all he had to do was defeat this guy again and get his son back so that his plans can get underway. He moved along quickly, using more skill and balance than the most dedicated ballet dancer ever could.<p>Genma kept up the speed and used his danger sense to make sure that his follower didn't get lucky with all those explosive spikes that were being thrown, there was a trail of damaged roofs behind him for several blocks that attested to his skill at evasion. He finally slowed down a little to see if he could spot the jerk, but all was silent, then he saw a glint of light and he launched himself off the roof just as a dozen spikes and throwing stars flew out of the night air to hit things all around the area. Genma dodged and weaved through the storm as best he could, batting those that got to close out of the air with ease. As of yet his attacker hadn't made an appearance of any kind, hell in their last three fights he had only ever seen the guy as a retreating shadow.<p>With a final jump Genma reached the edge of a roof and jumped across the distance between this and the newly framed building. He landed on the upper part of the building's framework and instantly flipped to the side as another series of explosive spikes slammed into the steel work. Genma instantly started to gather his Ki as he ran to center of the top floor along the metal I-beams, this type of attack with the Yama Sen Ken was incredibly destructive and would take a lot out of him, but it was well worth the time it took to get it right. Behind him a figure dressed in black landed on the edge and looked at him with every intention of killing him. Genma just smirked as he got a rare look a the guy that had been trying to kill him for some time now.<p>He was a short man, extremely thin, and flexible as he ran along the I-beams like a sure footed cat. Genma could feel him gathering his Ki as well, though it still wasn't up to his standards of skill. He was dressed as a ninja and blended in with the darkness around him almost completely, only the large weapon on his back gave him away and even that was nearly impossible to see. Whatever it was, he had no idea, only that it wasn't a sword and that the handle seemed wider than it should have been and had a large hollow ring at the very end. Genma took a battle stance and let his Ki funnel into the building supports, if this worked the way it did last time it would rip the whole building apart when he struck the right spot with the right amount of Ki.<p>"I've got you now you bastard."<p>"Do you?" Genma said with a smirk.<p>"A non moving target is so much easier to hit and you make it so easy to do at times." The dark figure said as it slinked it's way across the beams and made its way towards Genma, pulling a the large object off it's back, Genma still couldn't get a good enough look at the thing to see what it was.<p>Under normal circumstances Genma would have been a little more cautious, but dealing with a Ninja was like dealing with bugs. Kill one and more come out of the wood work and where there was one there was usually two or three hidden nearby as back up, though in this case Genma couldn't find any other aura's that would indicate this. "I remember out last fight Ninja, just how did you get away from that trap I led you into last time? I did drop half a mountain on top of you, but like a bug you seem to have survived."<p>"Pure skill asshole, you couldn't kill me if you even tried."<p>Genma snorted. "Luck is more like it Ninja, you picked the wrong time to pull this crap today and I'm going to prove that statement of yours wrong."<p>"You're an out of shape coward."<p>Genma just smiled and just looked back at his enemy as if he had nothing to fear, he kept his face free of any thing that might have clued his enemy into what he had planned for him. The move was almost ready to go by then, just a little more Ki to gather and he would be ready to make sure this Ninja never bothered him again.<p>The ninja stopped moving as he got in position and crouched down on the beam about ten feet away from Genma and studied him for a second, but it looked as if the man was just standing there without a care in the world. Then he leapt across the distance between them, bringing that weird weapon around to quickly behead his prey. This surprised Genma a little as he hadn't expected the moron to do a frontal assault with the possibility of a four story drop into the construction site below. He backed up a little and let the last of his built up Ki enter the structure and created a link to it so that he could set off the trap at any point he wanted.<p>Then Genma twitched and kicked out to catch the Ninja in the stomach, exploding into motion as they started to battle back and forth. Mid air combat, just like his son, was his specialty and attacking him in the air like this was almost like committing suicide, Genma pulled them off the I-beams and within a split second they were falling head first towards the ground. Ki aura's exploded from both of them and lit up the top of the building in a yellow and red contrast that highlighted everything around them. Genma's yellow hummed loudly over a foot from his body, while the Ninja's was quite a bit smaller and less focused. When his fist impacted against the ninja's chest and sent him flying back across the I-beams Genma knew he had this fight in the bag. With a flip Genma redirected his angle of decent and landed on a beam a couple of floor down, he smirked and looked up to see how the ninja had taken the hit. Only to have to suddenly dodge to the side as he found that the ninja almost on top of him, his oddly shaped weapon came down where Genma had been standing and sliced through the I-beam as if wasn't there.<p>Genma had a split second where he could have attacked, but he didn't move fast enough and the ninja flipped off the damaged beam and vanished into the darkness around them. A bit of sweat dripped down his face as the night went quiet again, he could only hear the sound of traffic in the distance as he stood there and concentrated. He needed to get the ninja in the right place to set off his trap, as he stood there he noticed that it was getting harder to hold the trap ready. He cursed under his breath and sent his senses out around him to pick up the slightest alteration of his surroundings, he needed to have a chance to counter attack in the right position. Reaction without thought was one of the prime tenants of the Anything Goes school and Genma proved it by suddenly twisting and falling off the I-beam for no noticeable reason, a couple of dozen shurinkan slammed into the metal around him, missing him by millimeters.<p>He flipped and landed on the ground with a grunt and did a stop, drop, and roll out of the way of another half dozen mini knives that slammed into the ground where he had landed, these exploded. Coming to his knees, Genma flared with yellow light and slammed his fist into one of the nearby I-beams and set off his trap a little early, he couldn't hold it anymore. He didn't unseal the forbidden techniques for just anyone, but this guy had become a pest that had to dealt with before the guy got lucky. He caught a glimpse of a fast moving shadow higher up in the building just as he set off his trap, a low level rumble went through the entire structure a split second later.<p>The building started to light up with yellow energy as his attack did it's work and he watched as entire I-beams wrenched themselves out of their mornings and caused the whole structure to collapse in on itself. The building was decimated in seconds and the rest of it seemed to be lit up in an ethereal fire, while at the same time Genma gave a mental yank and shattered the half completed floors and he was able to protect himself from his own attack. Seconds later the whole thing imploded on itself and came down around Genma, but didn't seem to affect him in anyway as he swatted the I-beams out of his way, the shattered into smaller pieces at his touch as his Ki had destroyed the bonds that held the metal together, though there were some close calls. He had a maniacal look on his face as he walked out of the area and scanned the area for the mangled body of the ninja, but he could find no sign of it.<p>Gasping for air, he glared at his surroundings and wondered if he hadn't just pushed himself to far. He almost exploded in frustration, but held his anger in check and moved out of the area when he started to hear sirens in the distance, feelings of fatigue washed over him and he was forced to leave the area as quickly as he could. Seconds later he was walking away from the destroyed building like a possessed man, a look of fear on his face and sweat dripping off his head and making his gi stick to him in uncomfortable places. He hadn't been this tired in several long years, even after collapsing that abandoned mine like he had the last time him and the ninja fought. He wasn't sure why, but a tiny part of him was telling him that he went a little to far. Then he shook himself and smirked, almost preening with pride as he looked at what he had done from another point of view.<p>He hadn't used that kind of attack since his early days when had first created the Yama Sen Ken, and it had been about ten times more powerful than the last time he used it. All that training over the years with his idiot son had done him a world of good, no one could stand up to him now except the Master and that was a fight he had no intentions of ever having in the first place. After watching the fire burn for several minutes Genma turned and limped off into the night, he wanted to get back to Tendo's place before Kasumi had dinner finished. He was really hungry after using up all that energy and he needed to replace it and what better way than food made by Tendo's daughter?<p>Behind him, a couple of roof tops away a shadow moved and the ninja staggered out of it and collapsed to it's knees. Gasping for air and knew he surveyed his injuries now that he had a chance and knew instantly that he was dying, he was missing his left arm and most of his outfit was shredded beyond decency, blood flowed down his left side and dripped all over the roof tiles, there wasn't a thing he could do to stop the blood flow. The ninja gasped, or gargled, for air as he caught a glimpse of Genma in the distance as he walked around a corner, the bastard had barely been injured in the attack.<p>The ninja reached into it's shredded jacket and grit its teeth in pain as he pulled out a small cell phone that was surprisingly intact and only sported a few scratches on its case, though dialing a phone with one hand is a pain in the ass. He carefully tapped a preset button and waited for someone to answer. His breathing slowed and a pool of blood had formed around him by the time ten rings had passed, then someone answered.<p>"Yes?"<p>"I found him, engaged him in combat and failed." He gargled.<p>"What happened?" Snapped the voice.<p>"He used some kind of super powerful Ki attack to collapse the building on top of me."<p>"I see, can you make it back?"<p>"No, I'm already dead."<p>There was silence on the other end for several seconds. "I see, we will avenge you."<p>The ninja gargled out a laugh. "Why bother, I am but a shadow."<p>"You are one of us."<p>"Then make him suffer, he has a lot to pay for. Trace the phone to find my body and have me disposed of."<p>"Of course...father."<p>With a gasp the ninja faded from life, only the soft crying from the phone could be heard on the cool night air and even that soon died off. Down in the debris of the building the Police were looking over the crime scene and spreading out to cover every square inch of the site when one of them found a strange looking object half buried in the collapsed building and pointed it out to his commanding officer.<p>"Sir!"<p>"What is it Ikari?" Said a trench coated man who walked over.<p>"Commander Smith, I found something odd sir, it doesn't look like any kind of construction device I've ever seen."<p>Commander Smith looked the object over carefully before pulling a glove on and carefully pulling the thing out of the pile, his first judgment on the thing was that it was... incredibly fucking heavy! "Gods, this thing has to weigh at least 200 pounds! I can barely lift."<p>"What the hell is it?" Ikari asked as he helped the commander lift the thing and tested the edge.<p>"Looks like a giant snow shovel."<p>"The edges of it are razor sharp so it has to be a weapon of some kind." Ikari said as he sucked on his bleeding thumb and hoped he hadn't just screwed up the evidence to much.<p>"Oh nice going sergeant."<p>"Heheheheh."<p>"Good work Sergeant, now go find some more and get your gloves on, do it properly this time, I'll get this to the car."<p>"Yes sir."<p>**********<p>With tired movements Rei leaned back against the wall of the furo and stifled a yawn as she thought about her horrid day, she didn't think it could get any worse than it already was either. She had sent Ranma out of the house for the whole weekend with that Nabiki girl, at least that had been the plan. Instead she had come home early this morning and stumbled into the shrine when everyone was asleep, Rei had been asked by her grandfather to take care of her and find out why she was home so early from visiting her friend. That had been a trial all on it's own because she had managed to come across Usagi as Mamoru lay into her with his insults, Rei had been forced to listen to Usagi as she cried over the communicator.<p>She was privately surprised that Usagi's wail didn't shatter all the glass in the area every time she did that. Even weirder was the fact that Ranma had interrupted the two and given the boy a thrashing right out in front of everybody. Usagi had oscillated between extreme sorrow filled with tears to cheering Ranma's actions, then back again, Rei didn't really know how to read a girl like Usagi. Even her vaunted PSI abilities failed her when it came to her flighty friend, weird things just seemed to follow her around like a cloak or something. Then she found out that she had to spend the rest of the morning cleaning out and dusting some of the unused rooms in the shrine, that had not gone over to well.<p>Normally she didn't mind, but she had about four hours sleep because of that creep Jedite and spent half the night tossing and turning, then Ranma, then the cleaning, then to have to spend all day in school, she had not been a happy camper by the time she got home. Then she had found out that Ranma had actually skipped school, SKIPPED IT, like doing so wasn't anything big. She liked Ranma, she really did and had proved on at least one occasion to be from the Silver Millennium so she wasn't as mean to her as she had been in the beginning, but there was no way that girl could be a Princess like Luna wanted them to believe. The girl had all the feminine grace of a walrus, she didn't know the simplest things about being a girl.<p>Like how to figure out one's sizes, she had no clue and just tried things on till they fit, getting her into the Jubaan High School uniform had been easy, getting her into one that fit correctly and didn't ride up in places had been impossible. She hadn't even know what a slip was, for crying out loud, everyone knew what a slip was for. They were so obvious, but not Ranma, give her a t-shirt and jeans and she would be ready to go to the Opera as if it was perfectly normal. Rei sighed, her feelings for Ranma tended to go from like to dislike in less than a second and she didn't know why. At least with Usagi she knew she didn't like the girl all that much, but when it came to Ranma she had no clue.<p>One day she was perfectly fine, acting like her normal self so long as certain subjects like martial arts, family, and rivals were not brought up. When they were though Ranma seemed to do a complete 180 and turn into this arrogant jerk that could drive her up a wall, that is what Ranma had been like this morning after she got back from Nerima, in a bad mood and willing to 'break' anybody that got in her way. Just like that fool Mamoru, she had been surprised when she heard that nothing permanent had been done to the guy. Usagi hadn't really noticed, she was to caught up trying to decided how to ask Motaki down at the arcade out and finding a way to avoid Mamoru to do so.<p>Rei dragged herself out of the bath and spent a few minutes slowly drying off with a large fluffy towel. Eventually she wrapped her hair up and used another towel to cover her body while she went down the hall to her room. She stifled a yawn as she heard Ranma practicing in the distance, making enough noise to be heard at this distance was pretty hard to do, but Ranma never failed to keep her yelling down as she went through her martial arts training. Rei dropped her towels and quickly got dressed in a pair of jeans and a long t-shirt, she wanted something comfortable and serviceable if something weird happened. She was constantly wondering about the super short skirts on their costumes, sure they made the look good and showed off her great legs, but that wasn't the point. She wanted to change them into something more useful, like color coded riot gear, but Luna said the most they could do was alter the color scheme. Like that was useful, she headed out of her bedroom and down the hall to the front room where Usagi and Ami had already arrived, she figured the old man let them in while she was busy.<p>The girls were sitting in the front room watching TV while they waited, Rei noticed that someone had set out a plate of cookies. Though Usagi was absently chain eating them as she sat there with a bored look on her face, she was getting crumbs all over her a long gray skirt, cute shoes, and a white blouse. Rei had seen the girl eat, so getting crumbs on her shoes was preferable to the walls. Ami on the other hand<p>"Hi Usagi, Ami."<p>"Hi Rei, where's Ranma?" Ami asked, she was wearing a simple black shirt and a pair of overalls. Rei figured they all thought that wearing comfortable clothes would be a good idea tonight since they didn't know what was going to happen.<p>"Just listen, you can hear her practicing back in the woods behind the shrine." They all listened, but after a few seconds of total silence Rei shrugged. "She must have finished, she'd been going at it for some time now. I'll bet she either on her way back in or already in the shrine somewhere getting changed."<p>"She certainly works hard, doesn't she?" Usagi asked.<p>Ito rolled her eyes when Usagi wasn't looking in her direction, she was of Luna's opinion that Usagi needed a good and swift kick in the pants to get her off her lazy butt and learn something instead of sitting around commenting on Ranma's actions. "Ranma has trained in martial arts all her life, with her Ki talents I honestly don't know if there is a normal human in the world that could beat her. Though she says she had met a few masters that were several levels above her skills."<p>Ami nodded as she pulled out her computer. "Ranma has been a great asset to us since she arrived. We were slowly losing against Jedite and his Youma, but when she turned up things shifted in our favor so much that losing those little battles would have been almost impossible. Jedite is the only one we have to worry about and Ranma has managed to hurt him on several occasions now."<p>"Ami, she may be an asset, but her arrogance gets on my nerves even faster than some of the things Usagi has done."<p>"Hey!" Usagi complained.<p>"Ranma is a very nice girl Rei, she doesn't respond well to people telling her what to do or how to do it. She has a classic loner profile and doesn't react well to authority figures, I'm not sure why though."<p>"Loner my ass, she's just a jerk with a large chip on her shoulder."<p>Ami shrugged and typed some more stuff into the little computer. "Well we need her, she has managed to add over 35% to our over all power level and increased the chances of taking Jedite out by over 40% in just the last three battles and we still haven't seen her full power yet."<p>"So what?" Rei grumbled and crossed her arms.<p>"The fight on the ship allowed her to show us some of her physical abilities and she wiped the floor with Jedite, this fight she will have to use her magical abilities and if these readings are right she should be able to do some serious damage."<p>"Humph!"<p>"It's time for all of you to get ready." Ito said as she padded into the room and hopped up on the coffee table in front of Ami's chair.<p>"Yeah, we have a little while yet to get ready for this fight with Jedite. Have you seen Ranma in the last little while?"<p>"I just got back from talking to her, she's in the shower right now getting cleaned up."<p>"She came in while you were in your room Rei." Usagi said from where she was sitting, she was wearing her normal stuff, . She was petting Luna, who was sitting in her lap looking as if the world was sitting on her shoulders, Usagi was oblivious to this.<p>Rei got out some food and set out some more cookies for Usagi and Ami as they sat moved to the dinning room, though Ami kept herself busy on her little computer. Whatever she was working on must have been important for her to spend so much time messing with it like that. Rei was about to ask when, of course, Ranma walked into the room drying her hair. This would have been fine, but she was only half dressed as she walked into the kitchen. She was wearing her normal red shirt and black pants, but the shirt was unbuttoned and let everyone in the kitchen see her chest, Ranma didn't even seem to have noticed as things jiggled hypnotically.<p>"Ranma!" Rei gasped in shock.<p>Ranma straightened up and looked back at Rei as she drank from a water bottle she kept in the refrigerator. "What's up Rei?"<p>"Button your damned shirt!"<p>Ranma blinked and looked down, she was wearing her normal black pants and shoes and they seemed to be in good condition, but she had only taken the time to toss on her shirt and hadn't had time to do anything with it and had to dry her hair before it dripped down the back and embarrassed her again. Since she refused to wear a bra, unless she had to, it meant that her the front was open and showing off the curve of her ample breasts for all the girls to see. She really didn't really see the point, but shrugged and went back to drying her hair as quickly as she could and set things to bouncing again.<p>"Sure Rei, I just need to finish this off first." Ranma said with a smirk and watched as Rei's face turned bright red.<p>"Y-you pervert!" Rei growled.<p>"Ah come on Rei, I'm just having a little fun."<p>"Don't worry about it Rei, were all girls here so it doesn't matter. I think it's nice that Ranma is so relaxed with her body that she doesn't care how she looks, I wish I was that confident about myself." Usagi said with more than a little envy. Luna just snorted and looked over at Ito, who just rolled her eyes again.<p>"Urk..." Ranma said and blushed a little, so much for teasing Rei a little before the fight started.<p>"Ami don't you think that Ranma should cover herself up while were at this meeting, we do have that fight to take care of later." Rei asked.<p>The blue haired scout looked up from her mini-computer. "Huh? What are you talking about?"<p>Rei slumped over with a sigh and pointed at Ranma.<p>"Oh, nice look Ranma." Ami said as she noticed the way Ranma was dressed, it didn't help that Ranma was absently scratching one of her breasts the instant Ami looked at her.<p>"Thanks Ami."<p>Everyone blinked as Ranma walked out of the room as if nothing was wrong, Ami just shrugged and went back to working on her computer. Though if anyone had been looking closely they would have seen the slight blush that was on Ami's cheeks, unfortunately they were all trying to get the image of Ranma scratching herself out of their heads. Ranma breezed back into the room a few minutes later, she had buttoned her shirt up. She looked a lot better and more alert than she had when she first entered the room, though the glare she was giving Ito was enough to make the cat start sweating.<p>"Are you ready for this fight Ranma, you seem a little too relaxed?" Rei asked.<p>Ranma gave a start and shrugged. "I'm always ready to fight and I owe that Jedite jerk a good beating for some of the crap he has tried to pull lately."<p>"I don't want to do this!" Usagi said and cringed back as Rei glared at her.<p>With an almost visible relief Rei turned to Usagi as the complaints she had been waiting for all evening finally materialized. "MEATBALL HEAD! We have to do this or he will destroy the entire city and kill millions!"<p>"But..."<p>"Don't complain to me about this!" Rei yelled back, it was a like a stress relief.<p>"Usagi, we have to stop Jedite, he has already come very close to killing several people. I'm included in that since I tend to stop him the most, his attacks have gotten really dangerous lately as well. He has to be stopped and hopefully the attacks will stop with him." Ranma said as she sat down beside Ami to see what she was working on.<p>"From what I have seen so far, Jedite is but the first of several people that will be attacking the coming months." Ami said as she looked up from her computer, then nearly fell over as she found Ranma sitting right beside her.<p>"What?" Usagi squeaked and nearly passed out.<p>Ranma raised and eyebrow, she had been in enough fights to know that Jedite wasn't anything more than the first round, but didn't understand how Ami knew. "How do you know that?"<p>Ami adjusted her glasses and gave Ranma and evil smirk, light seemed to reflect off the lenses with an almost audible 'shing!' sound. "In several of our battles Jedite has claimed that he is but one member of a group of men that are trying to control this world. That means that after we defeat him there will be someone else to replace him."<p>"I hadn't even considered that." Rei mumbled to herself.<p>"That makes sense really, I was thinking along the same lines myself." Ranma said.<p>Usagi whimpered.<p>"What's your problem Usagi! We've been doing this for months now!" Rei yelled.<p>"Killing a Youma or two is one thing, but you want us to just go out and kill Jedite just like that?"<p>"He's evil and trying to take over the world! Of course I want you to go out and just do him in 'just like that'!" Rei nearly screamed. "He's trying to kill us!"<p>"Will you all calm down!" Luna yelled as she hopped up on the table. "You need a plan so that you can get through this. Usagi, Jedite will not hesitate to kill you if he gets the chance so quit complaining and get your butt in gear."<p>"But I don't wanna!" Usagi Whined.<p>Luna sighed and hung her head.<p>Leaning back a little, Ranma wondered again if there was chance she could take on Jedite by herself like she had originally decided to do. There was a good chance, but she wasn't stupid enough to know that a planned trap like this wouldn't have a lot unexpected things that might happen. As much as she hated to admit it, that Tuxedo'd moron had a point, she couldn't do this alone. Glancing over at the Usagi and Rei, she ignored their fight and wondered if they really had what was needed to take this guy down, Ranma had her doubts about them all, they didn't have the right attitude for this. Though, for all their arguing, they did make a pretty good team when they got their act together and actually managed to carry out a plan. That usually fell to Ami when she used that little computer of hers to find an enemy's weakness or find the best way to win the fight.<p>"Do you think Tuxedo Mask will be there too?" Usagi suddenly asked.<p>Ranma winced as she remembered her conversation with the guy earlier and suddenly hopped the idiot didn't show up. She was getting really tired of bad Haiku and roses thrown like hand spikes, it was embarrassing. Sure they had a little power in them and a concussive wave strong enough cause more than a little damage was released when they hit, but they didn't help out all that much, it was more like a convenient distraction than anything else. Though Ranma was happy that he had been focusing his attentions more on Usagi than any of the others, it was better for his health if he kept doing that too. She had every intention of double punching the penguin suited idiot the instant the took it upon himself to save her from anything.<p>"Of course he will show up Meatball Head, we have a date!" Rei crowed.<p>Ranma sighed, why did girls do this kind of crap?<p>"What? But he's My Tuxedo Mask!" Usagi whined some more and started to get tears in her eyes.<p>"I thought you had a crush on that guy at the Arcade, Usagi?" Ami said in all innocence.<p>With a sigh Ranma stood up. "It's time to go, lets get this over with shall we."<p>"Um, Ranma, how are we going to get to Haneda Airport?" Usagi asked.<p>"I was going to roof hop, why?"<p>"It's on the other side of Tokyo, that's why, over forty miles away by land." Ami said, wondering why she hadn't thought about this before now. She blushed at her oversight.<p>"Then we take a car or bus." Rei suggested.<p>"The buses stop running at this time of night, were a good distance from one of the all night bus stops and they said on the news that they were stopping all bus service to Haneda Airport tonight to keep people away while the police took care of this threat." Ami said in return.<p>Ranma looked at the cats, but they just pretended to be sleeping all of a sudden, even going so far as to pretend to snore. "Some help you are."<p>Ito rolled over in her 'sleep' and absently scratched Ranma's ankle again.<p>"Hey, you idiot cat!" Ranma screeched from the ceiling. "Cut that out!"<p>"Ranma, most of the trains are run by computer, I can use mine to get into the system and get us there in a few minutes." Ami said.<p>Dropping to the floor, absently stepping on Ito's tail and getting a hiss of pain from the cat, she smirking innocently. Ranma thought it over for a second. "I don't know Ami, that might get us in trouble."<p>"It's your best option at the moment." Luna said.<p>"Alright then, we'll have to chance it then, though coming in by train will ruin the element of surprise."<p>"What kind of surprise would that be Ranma? He's bound to be expecting us at some point tonight." Ami pointed out.<p>"Yeah, but he has no idea from what direction we would attack from. Going by train will give him an easy target if he decides to attack it while where just sitting there."<p>"We'll have to hope he doesn't do that and at least gives us a chance, now let's go before we run out of time." Rei snapped and pushed everyone out of the room in a big jumbled up group and right off the front porch, she smirked as the pile looked up at her.<p>Down in the pile Ranma sighed and looked around, right into a pair of skimpy black panties as Ami tried to untangled them and had her foot slip as she was standing up, she sat right on Ranma's forehead, giving the girl a spectacular view of the material and what was inside them. "Oh my, I'm sorry Ranma."<p>"Ungh." Ranma said, her face bright red.<p>"Are you alright Ranma?" Usagi asked as she stood up and dusted herself off.<p>"Gurggle...Ungh." Ranma said with a twitch and passed out.<p>"Oh great, now look what you did." Rei snapped as she looked down at Ranma.<p>"How is this my fault, Pyro?" Usagi snapped. "You're the one that pushed us out the door in the first place, this is your fault!"<p>"Um..." Ami tried to interrupt them.<p>"If you weren't such a klutz this wouldn't have happened in the first place!"<p>"I tripped because someone pushed me!" Usagi yelled as she got in Rei's face.<p>"YOU'RE A KLUTZ, MEATBALL HEAD!"<p>"YOU'RE JUST A BIG MEANIE!"<p>"HAH!"<p>"Excuse me?" Ami tried again.<p>"CONTROL FREAK!"<p>"OH, THERE'S AN ORIGINAL INSULT!"<p>"QUIET!" Ami yelled and blushed as they turned to look at her. "Thank you, we need to get going, Rei you're the strongest of us, pick up Ranma and lets go."<p>"Why do I have to do it?" Rei complained and backed away a little when Ami glared at her. "Okay, okay, I'll do it this once."<p>Ami forced a smile at the two of them. "Excellent, this way we won't be late."<p>With a loud grunt Rei lifted Ranma over her shoulder and headed out with Usagi helping her a little by adjusting Ranma's clothing. Rei ignored it and whispered to Usagi. "What's up with her, she doesn't usually act like that?"<p>"I have no idea, maybe we went a little to far."<p>Rei grunted and nodded.<p>As they headed down the stairs Grandpa Hino stepped out of the shadows around the shrine with a puzzled look on his face and followed along behind the girls, they were up to something and he wanted to know what it was. His grand daughter was hiding something from him, she was keeping secrets and acting weird. The only time she even acted like herself anymore was when Ranma was around and even then it was just her temper, she didn't like to be shown up by anyone. He was so caught up in his thoughts and using his skills that he failed to noticed a small shadow following him from the roof tops as he followed the girls.<p>**********<p>"So what do you think of all this?" The reporter asked lazily.<p>Officer Ohitori just shrugged and spent a few seconds to light his cigarette. "I've never heard of anything like it before, we'll keep everyone out of Haneda Airport tonight to dispel the situation."<p>"But what about the threat?" Another question and a series of camera's flashed.<p>"The only thing I know of that could level the entire city in fire is a nuclear bomb and there aren't any in the country so it has to be a bluff or something else."<p>"Like what?"<p>"I have no idea, maybe arson or something and even then we have been on high alert since last night, we haven't found anything out of the ordinary."<p>"Do you think the Sailor Scouts will show up?"<p>Officer Ohitori scowled at said reporter. "No I don't think they will really show up, they are nothing but urban legends that are used to inspire little girls. I"ve never met one or heard of one and if they did exist we would have to arrest them for breaking the law. Obstructing Justice, Indecent exposure, and a few other things would be right at the top of the list of things we would use to arrest them."<p>**********<p>The girls were slowly moving through the darkened streets as they made their way to the Airport. Rei was still carrying Ranma while Ami and Usagi followed, they all looked a bit nervous. As usual the cats had decided to stay behind and monitor the situation from behind the lines, that was what Usagi had said, though Rei thought they were just being their usual selves and leaving all the heavy fighting up to them. It had been about twenty minutes since they left the Shrine and Rei was starting to have problems holding Ranma, her arms were getting tired.<p>Rei looked over at Ami to ask her for some assistance and sighed when saw the girl pull her computer out. "What now?"<p>"Were getting close to the Train station, I need to break into the main server so that I can get it to go where I want it."<p>"How do you know how to drive a train?" Usagi asked.<p>"I don't, but the computer does. I saw a documentary on it once, they said that the guys in the engines were more for emergencies than driving them, a large server is installed in each of the cars and allows the electronic signals to control the trains. The all follow the same orders from a main base station. For safety sake a computer runs them through out the city, that way they always follow the same schedule and are always on time."<p>"Um..." Usagi blinked.<p>"I see." Rei said.<p>"Good." Ami said and went back to typing, for a second there she had thought they didn't understand, but that was a clear as she could make it. Getting into the Rail Line's computer was harder than she had thought it would be, but her computer was far more powerful and soon broke through their primitive safeguards. She grinned, by the time they reached the train station she would be able to take them wherever she wanted, this was a part of this job she loved. She had to stifle a loud giggle as the excitement was almost unbarible, but she had learned not to do that around people. They gave her what she called the 'super geek' stare and she had been trying to get away from that for several years now.<p>Her computer beeped at her and showed a map of the area, there were several moving dots converging on their location. "Move a little faster, we have some people heading our way."<p>The girls started running, if they hurried they would make it to the train station ahead of their followerd. "Who are they?" Rei asked.<p>"Looks like national guard units, their foot, but armed."<p>Usagi whined.<p>Ranma was still out of it from being ground zero for Ami's panty plant, she still had the weird grin on her face as Rei lugged her around.<p>A few minutes later Ami led them up a set of stairs to a large building that belonged to the Yamanote JR Line, a circle line that connected a good many of the districts all around Tokyo. It usually ran day and night and had a station at the Airport, but this had been blocked due to the threat to the whole city by Jedite. They entered the huge building, it could hold up to a thousand people easily, and made their way to the platform, Ami was a bit surprised when no one was there to stop them, but shrugged it off as good luck. The train was sitting at it's dock with all the doors open, Ami knew something was wrong when she could tell that it's electric motors were running.<p>"This isn't right." Rei said as Ami stopped.<p>"What isn't?" Usagi asked, she was a little spooked to be in such a large building with no one around to even talk to.<p>"The train is running, I haven't even had a chance to select a train yet."<p>"Maybe they let it run all the time?" Usagi suggested.<p>Ami blinked and checked her computer again, she wasn't sure but she had a feeling that Jedite had been expecting them to come this way. "That doesn't feel right Usagi, this place rarely shuts down, but why leave the train running like this with no one here to run it. The government ordered everyone that could to stay home while this mess was dealt with, there were even supposed to be police patrols out tonight to make sure things didn't get turned into one giant mess."<p>"Luckily we dodged those guys you picked up, Ami. I don't want to think what would have happened if they had caught us." Rei said.<p>"Well let's board the train." Ami said and headed for a door near the front, to run the train she needed to be near the main computer core.<p>"What should I do with Ranma?"<p>"Put her in a seat, there's a water counter over there on the wall I'll grab some water and to try and wake her up." Usagi said.<p>"Alright, just hurry up." Rei snapped and stepped on to the train, she dropped Ranma into seat by the door just as Usagi returned with a cup full of water.<p>"Here you go Rei."<p>"Thanks Usagi." Rei said as the took the water, dipped her fingers in to get them wet, and flicked some water in Ranma's face.<p>Nothing happened.<p>Rei tried a couple of more times, but Ranma was a notoriously deep sleeper so after about five tries Rei gave up and tossed the cup of water in Ranma's face. She surged awake in an instant, went into a combat stance and took a swing at Rei all in the same movement. Rei ducked and fell to the floor in shock even as Usagi got out of the way, she looked up at Ranma and noticed that she was just then opening her eyes and looking around. Then she glanced down at Rei and blinked a few times, rubbed the water out of her face and smiled.<p>"Hi Rei."<p>"Um...hi?" She squeaked.<p>"Please don't throw water on me, it brings back a bad training accident I went through when I was a kid."<p>"Another accident Ranma? Don't you have any pleasant childhood memories?" Usagi asked.<p>"Not many Usagi, not many at all." Ranma snapped and walked off.<p>A few seconds later the train doors snapped shut and it started to move forward, slowly picking up speed. Ami wandered back into their car, she was reading something on her computer. "That should do it."<p>"How long will it take us to get there?" Rei asked.<p>"About fifteen minutes or so, we won't be making any of the usual stops along the way."<p>"Where's Ranma?"<p>"She walked out of here a few seconds ago." Usagi said sadly.<p>"Why?"<p>"Meatball Head reminded her of something from her past that she didn't want to think about." Rei said.<p>"She'll be alright, you know she doesn't like to talk about her past that much." Ami said.<p>**********<p>Jedite was standing on top of the main tower for the Airport using magic to keep the police from noticing him, he had been watching them for some time now. He had a glass of wine in his hand and he was sipping from it from time to time as he considered his plan to kill these girls. This battle had been in the making since the first Scout had shown up and started to interfere with his plans, until then things had been going perfectly. There hadn't even been any resistance strong enough to stop him, energy had been flowing to the Dark Kingdom in huge amounts. Then that first one had shown up, the first one that they had shrugged off as a useless waste of time.<p>Sailor V<p>At first she had only been an irritant that tended to get in his way every couple of attacks, then they had wasted a bit of energy and gotten her to leave the country on a wild goose chase. The last he had heard, she was now chasing monsters in England. The decoy youma was using regular criminals warped with a bit of dark energy, the girl had even found some helpers while over there. A couple of police officers and some moron that liked to throw around playing cards as a weapon.<p>Then he had been given this mission by Queen Beryl and he had come up with several plans to take energy on an even bigger scale, after all they had gotten rid of the only threat that had shown up. That had been the beginning of his downfall and he hadn't even known it. He had made so many mistakes over the last few months and had continued to make them even after he realized them. Then Sailor Moon had shown up and whining about having to fight and throwing his plans out of whack, she should have been easy to fight, right? Oh no, that little girl had foiled so many of his plans in the beginning that for little while.<p>For a time there is seemed that everything he tried had some kind of connection to this girl, he would show up at someplace completely random and get things going. Pulling in energy for days, then just as he had gotten enough energy to send back to Queen Beryl they would show up and destroy the whole thing. It was enough to make him think of really blowing up the city just to kill them off for the torment he had suffered though because of them. He had no intention of ever being put in that pit again, death would be preferable to drowning in that soupy death trap.<p>He finished off his wine in a large gulp when he received the mental warning that one of his lookouts had spotted some girls heading this way. He turned and opened a portal and stepped through to appear high over the Airport. He could see all the police and national guard that had taken up positions around the area. With a whispered spell he reached out and touched them all, at first they had no idea what was going on, but they quickly found themselves in the grips of the spell. Almost as one they all staggered around and collapsed into a deep slumber.<p>Then he reached out and touched the mind of the Youma he had brought along to help him with this fight. With another gesture all the humans he had affected vanished, leaving their clothes behind. The Youma wasn't all that intelligent, but he made up for it with a very useful ability to call on. "Master?" It asked in it's dry voice.<p>"Follow the plan I gave you." Jedite snapped.<p>"Yes sir."<p>Minutes later Jedite smiled as he saw the that the police were back on their feet and walking around just like they had been. "This plan is full proof, there's no way these idiotic girls can get away from me this time. My Youma will take care of the Moon, Mercury, and Mars easily leading them into a trap. Leaving the Red Headed Bitch to me, she will be on her knees begging for death by the time I'm done with her!"<p>"BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!"<p>**********<p>"...list of things we would use to arrest them."<p>Back at Police head quarters, Officer Ohitori's face could been seen on the large TV screen taking up one wall as he talked to the press. His boss was banging his head against a wall at that point and wondering how this moron had been placed in a position of authority and why he was answering questions like this on live TV. They gave classes on how to do these things every few months, simple answers like 'no comment' and 'back off there is nothing to see here'. Questions could be answered all the criminals were caught and dealt with, he stopped banging his head and moved to make a phone call.<p>"Hello?" Said a mysterious voice.<p>"Get that idiot off TV or heads will roll, the man is causing a panic."<p>"Understood sir."<p>"He is to report to me before the hour is out."<p>"Yes sir."<p>Godi grunted and slammed the phone down as he rubbed his head, he encouraged original thinking, but this was pure stupidity that could only cause more problems than it solved. He wished he was still in command of the Pat Labor project again, at least then he'd had a bit of say in what happened around him them. He opened a drawer on his desk and pulled out a bottle of red liquid, twisted the top off and took a long pull. It was drained seconds later and slammed down on the desk with a sigh.<p>"Damn it, can't I even get decent fruit juice anymore? Fucking doctors and their new diet regulations. Humph! Natsumi, Miyuki get in here!<p>There is a crash in the outer office, a few seconds later the two girls walk into the office pretending as if nothing had happened. "You wanted to see us sir?" Miyuki asked as she adjusted her long brown hair.<p>"I need you to go down and get me some more drinks." Godi said.<p>Miyuki nodded and smiled.<p>"You've got to be kidding?" Nasumi snapped, she looked insulted.<p>"Do I look like I'm kidding." Godi said with a completely straight face.<p>"We're police officers, not errand girls!" Nasumi yelled in his face.<p>"You're not doing anything of interest anyway."<p>"Get it yourself!"<p>"I'm not allowed to leave, you are."<p>"...but, I'm thirsty."<p>"Here you go sir." Miyuki said as she sat some more bottles down on Godi's desk.<p>"Thank you dear." Godi said happily.<p>Natsumi face faulted with a groan.<p>**********<p>"Are you feeling better Ranma?" Usagi asked, tears in her eyes.<p>"Yeah, don't worry about it." Ranma said with a forced smile as she reentered the car where the girls were sitting. It was weird to be on a train with no one else on it, something she had never seen before.<p>"I'm sorry I won't ask about that stuff again."<p>Ranma shrugged and made her way over to a seat by Ami. "How much longer until we reach the Airport?"<p>"Just a few more minutes."<p>"Are all of you sure you want to do this?" Ranma asked.<p>"We've already discussed this Ranma." Rei said.<p>"I know, but I feel bad taking you into this fight." She refused to look the girls in the eye as they gave her a weird look. "You've all got power, but this will be a fight that is a lot more dangerous than those early ones you were in, I don't wan to place you in danger."<p>"We have to do this as a team Ranma, Jedite challenged all of us." Rei snapped back.<p>"Alright, I won't bring it up again, just be ready for anything. Jedite is going to pull anything to win this."<p>Rei shot Usagi a worried glance, but saw that the girl was more worried about Ranma than the upcoming fight. They were rounding a curve when she felt the wave of evil that was hovering over the whole Airport. She sat up and looked around as if she expected to fight it off that instant. Ranma and Usagi were giving her a weird look as the came to her feet and started to look around. Then Ami's computer started to beep and they knew it was time to get to work, even Ranma could feel the difference now.<p>"I'm picking up multiple readings just ahead." Ami said as the train suddenly slowed to as top at a dock.<p>All was quiet at first, but as they moved to the doors they could see dozens of police officers collecting on the dock to arrest them. Ranma cursed and crossed her arms, she had no intention of allowing these idiots to take her in this easily. She looked around as the others sighed in defeat, outside the police closed on the train with drawn weapons, but Ranma smirked as she saw a way out of this.<p>"COME OUT OF THE TRAIN WITH YOUR HANDS UP GIRLS, YOUR UNDER ARREST!" Called out a dry voice.<p>"What do we do?" Usagi whispered, she looked nervous.<p>"Ami, you said that you were picking up multiple readings? Could it be that the police are possessed or something?" Ranma asked.<p>After several seconds of typing Ami nodded. "Yes, but those aren't police at all. I'm reading a bunch of...sand?"<p>"Their like moving statues." Usagi said as she looked out the window's nervously.<p>"What were you planning Ranma?" Rei asked. "I've got a plan that might work too."<p>"Look how their trying to surround us, their really spread out, I was planning on just running through them."<p>Rei rolled her eyes. "Your fast enough to do that Ranma, and maybe Usagi here who has to do a three mile dash every morning, but me and Ami aren't that fast."<p>"Hey!" Usagi yelled.<p>Rei pulled out a batch of ofuda and thumped them against Ranma's forehead a few times and smirked. "These should take care of the problem."<p>"Ofuda? Where in the world did you get those?" Ranma asked as she rubbed her forehead and glared at the girl.<p>"I'm a Shinto shrine maiden, I always carry some of these around with me."<p>"Wai!" Usagi glomped Rei's waist. "Your the greatest Rei!"<p>Rei's eye twitched as she gave the blonde the evil eye. "Um...yeah."<p>"I know we can win this now!" Usagi crowed as she let go and stalked off the train with a confident step. Ranma, Rei, and Ami all looked at each other and sighed as about three seconds later they heard Usagi scream. "WHAAAAAAAA GET'EM OFF GET'EM OFF GET'EM OFF!" Usagi yelled as she ran back and forth in front of the train waving her arms in a hysterical display and pulling several of the Youma men with her in a long chain.<p>"Well at least she has spirit, can't say she has brains, but she definitely has what it takes to get through this."<p>"You want me to help her out?" Rei asked as she watched Usagi's panicked flight around the whole area, running over the moving statues.<p>"Check that out, she's taken out over half of them already." Ami said as she ran a scan on her computer again.<p>They stepped off the train a few seconds later and saw that Usagi was laid out on top of a high pile of unmoving sand statues, gasping for air and as usual making a scene. Ranma smiled and bounced on over to pat the girl on the shoulder. "Thanks Usagi, that was great work!"<p>Usagi moaned.<p>"I mean you took them all out and didn't even have to transform or anything, even I planned on transforming before running though all of them. Great job!"<p>Usagi whimpered as Rei tossed several of the Ofuda on the pile and watched as the whole thing glowed for a few seconds before dying with a flare of light. "Thanks Usagi, I didn't want to use up all my Ofuda."<p>"Amazing Usagi, I didn't know you had it in you." Ami said quietly as she walked over and stood next to Ranma and Rei.<p>With a grin Ranma pulled Usagi to her feet and patted her on the shoulder. "Alright everybody, it's time to transform and go kick Jedite's ass!"<p>"MARS POWER, MAKE UP!"<p>"MERCURY POWER, MAKE UP!"<p>"MOON PRISM POWER, MAKE UP!"<p>Ranma didn't like to transform unless she had to, every time she did it set in motion something she wanted to avoid. She grit her teeth as the others looked at her in confusion and sighed as she held up her arms and made her gold and black bracers appear. "SOL CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"<p>This feeling of pure ecstasy filled Ranma, nearly making her eyes roll back in her head, and she moaned as she was lifted into the air, the bracers flare with a blinding light, when it recedes Ranma is clad in a fuku unlike any have ever seen before, reddish black leather body suit, a red and black skirt, a green front bow and a white back bow with the ribbons trailing nearly to the floor. She had on knee high reddish black boots, the arm bands now decorated with little crescent moons, and a tiara with a ruby in the center pulsing slowly with power. Strong and fast, powerful and unstoppable enough to take on all of the demons in Jedite's arsenal.<p>"Whoa!" Ranma said with a blush, that had been even more intense than the last time she transformed.<p>"Sailor Sun, are you all...EEPPP!" Sailor Moon squeaked as Ranma gave her this look that chilled her to the bone.<p>"I hate that ridiculous name."<p>"What do we call you then? Baka?" Mars snapped and smirked.<p>"Call me Starfire, it still suggests the sun and allows me to keep some pride without using that stupid name."<p>"STARFIRE?"<p>"Yeah, I think it sounds cool." Starfire grinned and fussed with her hair absently, then looked at her arm as if it had just betrayed her.<p>"How in the world did you get that weird version of the fuku?" Mercury asked as she scanned Ranma.<p>"When I was given the Pen it changed to these Bracers, Pluto said it had addapted to make me a modern version of a Sailor Scout. I like the power up, but the even this new outfit is a pain in the ass, I hate it." Ranma muttered as she tried to pull the skirt down a little to cover her legs.<p>"Are you kidding, you look great in that Starfire." Moon gushed.<p>Starfire shrugged. "You should know by now that I really don't like to wear skirts."<p>"Don't think of them as skirts, these are like an ice skaters outfit more than anything else. They look good and are easy to move around in, they work." Mars pointed out, she didn't like them either, but didn't want to admit it to the others.<p>"Well I still don't like them, but at least I'm not running around in a Harem outfit or something." Starfire shuddered.<p>All the girls nodded.<p>**********<p>Jedite was looking down on the Scouts as they ran out of the building and started to looking around for him, they split up just outside the door and each headed across the field to a different landing strip. He was in a pretty good mood considering he had just lost yet another Youma, they had all transformed right when he was watching them from the shadows and that had negated the magic that made up their cloaking field. He had memorized their faces and been surprised to see that all of them were mere children, that was a blow to his ego that had hurt. They were barely out of diapers and they had been taking down his toughest Youma with relative ease.<p>He glared at the bask of the one he wanted the most, she had said her name was Ranko in one of their last encounters. Yet the girls had been calling her Ranma just before they transformed and started using their Scout names, he wasn't sure which name was the real one but it wouldn't matter by the time this ended, she would be dead. He looked over each of the Scouts as they ran, what would be the easiest way to kill them and still save a bit of energy? After a few seconds he decided to try a fun way to kill them, running them over with the very planes they were here to safeguard.<p>Magic flared around his hands like lightning and soared into the sky all over the Airport striking a dozen planes at once. They all started up to whine as their engines built up power, he smiled as all four girls skidded to a halt and started looking around in confusion. "Don't stop now Scouts, we still have time to play before the time of your deaths arrives. These are my new toys, play with as many as you want!" Jedite yelled out, using magic to make his voice echo all over the Airport. He didn't care who heard him, the sleep spell would last for several days and had an area effect of several miles, so there was no one around but the Scouts and had excluded them from the spell.<p>This was a personal fight, they had caused him to much embarressment to get off with a simple death that would have awaited them if he had caught them with spell. He had to crush them in battle, it was the only way to regain his favor with Queen Beryl and cement his position among the Army once more. He laughed as the Scouts started running from the planes, the one in red looked like she was about to blast one of the smaller one's as it chased after her, but it was on her before she could charge up a blase.<p>"Better not destoy one of those planes Sailor Mars, who knows, the city might make you pay for it!" Jedite yelled and saw her stumble to a stop and start cursing. "BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"<p>Down below Starfire cursed as well as she rolled out of the way of a tire taller than she was and let the big 747 cruise by her. Staying out of their way was easy, but there were three planes cruising after each of them at once. That was making them hard to dodge as they came at them from three different directions at once. After several minutes of this and watching as Sailor Moon was nearly run over on at least six different occasions, Starfire was beginning to seriously consider blowing up the planes. Then her communicator started to beep and she pulled it out in mid dodge as and idea occurred to her.<p>"I'm a little busy right now, what?"<p>"We can't destroy the planes so we need to escape them." Mercury said to all of them.<p>"Escape? I just thought of a way to do that." Starfire said.<p>"How?" Mars yelled.<p>"It takes them forever to turn around, lead them all to the end of your strip, the very edge, and then jump up on a wing and run down the main body of the plane. It should run right off the edge of the landing strip and get stuck."<p>"D'OH!" Said the other three girls and instantly started to do just that.<p>Starfire tapped into her Ki and raced down the long pavement of the landing strip, she was moving so fast that it was hard to tell where she was. Up above Jedite just watched and wondered what they were up to, it looked like they were about to give up so he sped the planes up so that when they ran the girls over it would leave a nice looking smear on the tarmac, he grinned. That changed in an instant though as Starfire casually hopped up on the wing and dashed down the main body of the plane, hopped onto a tail fin and to the ground. The plane right off the pavement with a sickening crunch, Jedite tried to stop the planes and get them reoriented, but the strain was incredible.<p>He had to land on the ground to call forth the amount of power he needed just to stop the planes, then he heard three more crashes and realized that they had fooled him and went red with rage. Then the unexpected happened, something flew down out of the sky and slammed against his shield in a show of sparks as it was disintegrated on contact. What surprised him was that it hit with so much force that it knocked him back several steps. He cursed and turned just in time to see a whole wave of...roses slammed into his shield. Each of them gave off a concussive blast that seemed pushed him back more and more.<p>The strain of keeping control of the planes was making it hard for him to keep up his defenses he hadn't expected this fool to challenge him like this. He always showed up when the blonde one was in trouble, so why was he attacking like this, if his defenses had been less than they were he would have been in trouble. Jedite snarled and started crackling with electric like energy. "Tuxedo Mask."<p>"You won't get away with this Jedite, your Evil stops here." Mask said as he pulled his cane and held it like a sword.<p>"You just signed your death warrant."<p>"TUXEDO MASK!" Sailor Moon yelled, she was to far away from them to much more than that.<p>Jedite materialized a sword and launched himself forward, he hadn't expected to fight this one. Of all the Scouts, Mask was the most cowardly, striking from the shadows and throwing flowers to distract his Youma while the little girls did all the work. He blinked in surprise as his sword was blocked and Mask kicked him in the gut with a powerful kick that sent hm stumbling back again. It seemed there was more to this idiot than he had though, but it wasn't good enough.<p>Tuxedo Mask crept forward and willed his cane to extend, it slammed into Jedite's stomach and blew the air out of his lungs. He glared into a Jedite's eyes as they turned even more insane than they already were, the man started to grin as he slowly stood up. It was quite obvious he hadn't done as much damage as he had though. They yelled and slammed together again, trading blows for several seconds, Jedite's grin stayed plastered to his face as they moved back and forth. Then it happened, Jedite suddenly did a spin kick when Mask was over extended and kicked him in the head.<p>Dazed, Tuxedo Mask stumbled back as Jedite knocked the cane out of his hand and slammed the pommel of his sword into his head, he dropped like a stone. Instead of killing him, Jedite kicked him in the stomach with a magically enhanced kick and sent him flying out into the bay. Just to add insult to injury and to keep the moron out of his hair, Jedite fired off several blasts of dark energy. Mask landed just before the blasts arrived, but when they hit the water they exploded and sent a fountain of water nearly fifty feet into the air. Then he turned to look at the Scouts at they got near enough for them to hear him.<p>"NOOOOOOOO!" Sailor Moon screamed.<p>"Ooops! I don't know my own strength, BWHAHAHAHA! Now it's your turn, who want to go first?" Jedite asked as if he was the friendliest person in the world.<p>"You'll pay for that Jedite!" Mars yelled.<p>"Bring it on girlly, all of your are going to die and I plan to do it with my bare hands." Jedite snarled. "You won't have the chance to ruin anymore of my plans."<p>"FIRE SOUL!" Mars yelled and fired off a fire ball.<p>Jedite just sneered and batted the attack out of the air, he was running at nearly his full power and these girls didn't stand a chance against him. "Is that all you can do girl? For some reason I expected more out of you, killing all my Youma and all. Shall we play some more, I'm not quite ready to kill you just yet, you haven't suffered enough."<p>In a black and red streak Starfire ran forward, she had been waiting for this fight since the challenge had been make. Ranma jumped nearly seven foot into the air as she attacked and tried to kick Jedite in the head, but he just spun out of the way. She landed and bounced, this time staying close to the ground and attempted to sweep his feet, but had to roll out of the way as he attempted to take her head off. Then things got weird as Jedite charged up his power again and started throwing blasts of energy at her, they exploded all over as she dodged and twisted out of the way of everyone that came close.<p>"You have to do better than that Ranko, your the whole reason for this fight and I plan on breaking you before I kill you."<p>"You don't stand a chance against me."<p>"AGHAAAAAAAAA!" Jedite screamed.<p>Starfire hopped up into the air and used one of the explosions to cloak her presence, she hadn't had a chance to practice some of her magical attacks yet, but Jedite was getting on her nerves. She reached deep into her body and touched her magic for the first time since Jusenkyo and felt it surge through her like an uncontrollable river of power. Her aura swirled around her and lit up the area in a bright silver glow as she locked eyes with Jedite and saw him look at her in shock.<p>"SILVER METAL STARLIGHT!"<p>The small ruby on Starfire's tiara flared up and started to glow as all that power was channeled to the small jewel. Then a beam of mercury like energy fired out as Starfire screamed in fury, it sailed across the short distance between them and slammed into Jedite's shield. The impact sounded like a one ton metal I-beam hitting the ground and hit with enough force to pushed him back several feet, but Starfire's eyes narrowed as she saw that the shield hold against the blast. She landed glared at Jedite, that blast had been nearly twenty times more powerful than what Mask threw with his roses, it should have gotten him easily. Then she saw his eyes as they contacted hers and he smiled at her evilly as the smoke and dust from his blasts swirled around him.<p>"Your pathetic, I expected more from you than a weak attack like that." Jedite said scornfully and started spinning his sword again. "Where's all your skills and power now Red, they certainly aren't helping you out of this mess are they?"<p>"You haven't seen anything yet." Starfire said, that sword of his had to go though, he had nearly had her on more than one occasion and she knew from experience just how painful that thing could make things with just a simple scratch. It could get through his shield and easily get her, there had to be a limit to his power. The rest of the Scouts came running up as she was about to attack again and Mercury waved her computer about to get her to notice something.<p>"Starfire, he's using your own energies against you."<p>"Huh?"<p>Mars nodded. "When Tuxedo Mask attacked he was using some kind force attack according to Mercury, when they hit it was like using a baseball bat or something. You are using pure energy with that Silver Metal Starlight attack of yours and he's using that to fuel his shield."<p>"Correct, we need to take him down in some way that doesn't use magic. That ability is also why he was able to defeat my attack as well." Mercury added.<p>Starfire relaxed a little as they talked, though she kept an eye on Jedite out of the corner of her eye. "Were you able to come up with anything?"<p>"I have a plan, but it will require all of us working together to do it." Mercury said and started to explain the plan.<p>After a couple of minutes Starfire nodded, though she wondered why Jedite was just standing there letting them talk as if he wasn't in any danger at all. "That sounds like it will work, but how do we pull it off? The timing would have to be almost perfect for it to work."<p>"That's why need to use teamwork for this." Mars said.<p>"Alright then, lets get to work and see if we can pull this off and get out of here."<p>"RIGHT!" They all said.<p>"Besides I'm hungry enough to gnaw on a table leg or something." Starfire said, the girls all moaned. "Heh, that can wait for later though."<p>"Are you done talking yet, I'm getting bored just standing over here doing nothing." Jedite called.<p>"Fine then, we'll attack." Starfire said. "GO!"<p>"FIRE SOUL!"<p>"SILVER METAL STARLIGHT!"<p>"Oh please, come up with something better than this you wimps!" Jedite called as he batted both blasts out of that air.<p>"SHABON SPRAY!" Mercury yelled and centered the wave of fog on Jedite and cut him off from the world.<p>"What is this supposed to accomplish you Twits?" Jedite yelled.<p>Then he realized that he couldn't figure out where he was and understood what the true nature of Mercury's attack was. It was a cover that cast a kind of confusion on whoever it was cast on, warping his perceptions so much that finding his way out of the fog was nearly impossible. Luckily his shield had...taken the blast of magic for him, though it still messed with his mind a little. He started laughing as he realized that they had figured how his shield worked and did this on purpose.<p>"I'm impressed, I didn't think you had what it took to figure it out!" Jedite yelled.<p>"You ain't seen nothing yet!" Echoed Starfire's voice from all around him, it left this silence that was almost so think he could feel it on his skin.<p>To dispel the fog he had to drop is shield, it had blocked the freezing aspect of the fog and turned the shield into low pleasure wave that was maintain the fog. Without the shield it would lose it's focus and quickly vanish, but would leave him open for a few precious seconds. He banished the sword to subspace and raised his arms, several dozen blasts of explosive energy fired out to rain down around him in all directions. The instant the first explosion went off he dropped the shield and started to weave a dispel magic spell.<p>Then he realized his mistake as Sailor Mars ran right by him and slapped something on his back that burned by like fire and froze all the muscles in his body. Then Starfire ran by and decked him across the face, the other one, Mercury was a few seconds after that and she hit him in the same way from the opposite direction and he remained rooted to the spot. "What the hell did you do?"<p>"Hi!" Sailor Moon yelled as she ran by without touching him and vanished from sight. "Bye!"<p>As the last of the fog finally dissipated enough to see he heard the whine of an engine and his eyes tripped in size. He had put the planes on automatic when he started fighting Tuxedo Mask, this would make them follow and run over any of the scouts if they got to close. Sailor Moon had just run by him like a bat out of hell, he nearly fainted, this was going to hurt. The front of the plane passed over him and the edge of the wheel clipped his back and nearly wrenched his spine out of his body, it also dislodged whatever Mars had done to him and he fell the ground.<p>"Damn it didn't work!" Starfire yelled as she ran back to Jedite and kicked him in the stomach. She concentrated and built up as much power as she could, Mars, and Moon all ran up and charged up their attacks as well. Jedite took this as an opportunity to crawl to his feet, blood was running down his chin and he knew he had several broken ribs. Then his senses noticed that someone was watching this fight, he wasn't sure who, but knew that they were...amused.<p>"FIRE SOUL!"<p>"SILVER METAL STARLIGHT!"<p>"MOON TIARA ACTION!"<p>The first two hit him in the stomach and sent him reeling, he barely managed to duck the magically powered Tiara as it screamed right for his neck. Then his world went dark as he felt a tug at his soul and knew that Queen Beryl had just recalled him, he screamed in pain as all his atoms were slowly unraveled and yanked back to the Dark Kingdom. He appeared in the main gallery where he had met with Beryl so many times before, it took all his remaining strength to remain standing and not pass out right there. Her angry eyes bored into his and he knew that there wouldn't be any more chances, he had sealed his fate and that left him with only one option.<p>**********<p>Sailor Moon ran over to the edge of the bay where Tuxedo Mask had been thrown in the water. "Do you think he survived?"<p>"I don't know." Starfire said. She didn't like the guy, but that didn't mean she wanted him to dead.<p>"I hope he's alright." Mars said as she stepped up next to Moon.<p>"Um..." Started Mercury, but she was interrupted as the water near a dock about ten yards away from them broke and Tuxedo Mask climbed out and coughed up a lot of water.<p>"TUXEDO MASK!" Sailor Moon and Mars yelled and ran over to him.<p>"As I was about to say, Tuxedo Mask is over there, he has suffered some light wounds but nothing life threatening." Mercury finished.<p>Starfire crossed her arms. "Oh great, a happy ending.'<p>"Happy endings are always a good thing Starfire."<p>Humph!"<p>**********<br/>The End of Book One *Jedite*<p>Notes - This is one huge project, I've just finished with Jedite and have already done close to 550kb worth of work. Each of the Generals is to have his own book as with several chapters, coming up next will be Nephlite of course and he requires a bit of work. I have to figure out if I want him to go after Molly, who I haven't introduced just yet, or Ranma since they would get along with each other. Let me know how you want it to go, but be warned if you pick Ranma it won't be Ranma suddenly turning into a girl that likes Men, but as friends as she tries to understand her feelings for him and why she has such weird reactions when he is around. Let me know which would be better.<p>I made some mistakes during this, I know of a couple of them and plan to fix them eventually. Shampoo is also a candidate for Nephlite, maybe a love triangle or something. Yes I'm also bringing Cologne into this, this story is a mix of Ranma and Sailor Moon and needs them as characters, I plan to bring everybody in eventually it will just take time and their parts will be a bit different than normal.<p>Certain parts of the Nephlite story will be mixed the Ranma one to make them merge a little better and other parts will only be mentioned in passing. All of the main parts are planned so don't worry about me missing something big or skipping over it, there are only five main episodes in this part anyway. I would also like to know if you want me to detail more of the Dark Kingdom like I did when Jedite was in that pit and how they treat each other.<p>Finally, I'm going to take a break from this story for awhile and get recharged for the next arc. I've got writers block something major and it has slowed me down a lot more than I expected and that means that a lot of the fun of writing is gone, I had to force myself to put down almost every word of this chapter and disliked most of it. Those parts that were sillier than normal were my attempts to get over my writers block and they worked a little, but not enough to keep it up for long. So I need a break and will be moving on to Uncles, Replacement, and Golden Opportunity for awhile while working on a summary for the next chapter of Princess of the Moon.<p>So long for now...the part below was one of the scenes I cut from the final draft because it was unusable.<p>**********<br/>Something for fun ^_^<br/>Typical Anime Strangeness?<p>In another part of the city thousands of Sailor Moon Otaku were having a convention at a local hotel. Watching the newest episodes, playing the video games, and ogling the scantily clad girls in action, they were Otaku after all. They were all in an auditorium watching the news cast about the fight. They were also memorizing the name of the Anti-Christ and making plans to pay him a visit some time soon. This policeman would not be allowed to arrest heir goddess in pigtails, they had would make sure her young nubile body was there for all to see. The worst thing was that these were thousands of full grown men dressed up in costumes from the show. Playing with dolls, dreaming about being one of the Scouts and fighting for Love and Justice, even the gods shuddered at the sight.<p>"...list of things we would use to arrest them." Said the I Max'ed size screen where the interview was being broadcast inside and auditorium.<p>A mass growl of anger filled the air for blocks around the hotel, employee's could be seen fleeing the structure in a state of panic. Soon hordes of really ugly men in skimpy fuku were seen marching to war out the front doors, brandishing well polished scepters, hand held weapons, and other things that were best left unmentioned. Screams of fright filled the night air as the horde made it's way across the city in a direct course towards Haneda Airport. Singing filled the air as they called upon their song of inspiration.<p>Moon Revenge<p>Grasping tightly to a love you've finally found your way to, you rest gently in a brief sleep. Laying a goodbye kiss on your closed eyelid, I left you behind in the garden of time.<p>Love can't continue as a mere dream But if you lust after it, it becomes a beautiful but hollow shell. But still...<p>If that's what you want, then chase after me. That kiss is a red tattoo, a tattoo that engraves a prophecy of destiny I'll know with just one look There's a tattoo that hurts in the shape of your lips; you can't hide it. It's Moon Revenge, wooo...<p>Auras drawn by each other, even when enveloped by darkness cannot be snuffed out, and will not falter.<p>I can still see our parting so clearly, and it burns. Yet, I hope the next one fate draws me to could be you again.<p>The deeper the love, the greedier it is I even want to bind up every sigh you make. It's irrational, but still...<p>Climbing to the top of the whirlpool of light, Crimson memories are a poisonous tattoo a tattoo that shows the chaos of the future.<p>When we are together, the tattoo hurts in the shape of your lips until we shatter. It'd be nice if you'd keep holding me. It's Moon Revenge, wooo...<p>If that's what you want, then chase after me. That kiss is a red tattoo, a tattoo that engraves a prophecy of destiny I'll know with just one look There's a tattoo that hurts in the shape of your lips; you can't hide it. It's Moon Revenge, wooo...<p>There was nothing more frightening than an Otaku on the war path. ^_^;;<p>**********<p>These are the Lyrics to "Moon Revenge" Here's the link to where I got them. .<p>Yamanote JR Line -<p>I got some episode information here - .
