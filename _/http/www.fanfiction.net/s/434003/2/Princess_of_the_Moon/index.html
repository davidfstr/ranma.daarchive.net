</div>**********<p>Princess of the Moon<br/>Chapter 01<br/>By C. Rose<br/>(c)2001<p>**********<p>When she woke up, Ranma crawled out of her tent and began her early morning<br/>streach and work out, us usually lasted about three hours, so it was nearing<br/>8am by the time she finished up. She grabbed a pan out of her pack inside<br/>the tent and walked over to the lake that was the main attraction of the park<br/>she had slept in and used it to dump several pans of water over her and<br/>to get rid of her sweat. Several of the guys out jogging nearly dropped dead<br/>from shock as she did this, it had her wet silk shirt clinging to her curves<br/>in a very interesting manner, Ranma didn't even notice as she dried her hair<br/>with a towel that had seen better days.<p>She had a lot on her mind as she thought about that fight the day before<br/>and those weird girls who had said she was some kind of princess. Ranma<br/>snickered to herself again, if they only knew that I had used to be a guy,<br/>they wouldn't have even tied that. She would have dismissed them entirely,<br/>but that three story jump those two girls had made was nothing to sneezed<br/>at. That kind of skill took years of practice to learn, whoever they were,<br/>they were very strong and talented. A few months ago she might have<br/>dismissed them as useless since they were female, but being stuck like this<br/>full time had force the true reality down his throat on a daily basis,<br/>girl's were not weak unless they wanted to be. Every other girl he'd met in<br/>China as she traveled around had been a decent fighter and she had spent<br/>several days camped in certain places as she challenged female fighters<br/>around the area and learned from them.<p>Those fights had the most fun she'd had since the change and she had<br/>mastered several special attacks and even a couple of Ki attacks to add to<br/>her arsenal of growing special attacks. Now these girls were looking to try<br/>and get her to join their team, if it wasn't for that uniform, she may have<br/>been tempted, but as it was maybe she could get them to fight her on a one<br/>on one basis to see how good they were. She picked up and packed her stuff<br/>as she thought all this through and wondered where to go from here. Without<br/>her family she was Ronin and didn't have very many options.<p>She was in the Juban district if she remembered right, maybe she could find<br/>a part time job and make some money before settling down somewhere. While<br/>making her way out of the park, Ranma noticed the local truancy officer<br/>heading her way, a scowl on his face. School, she didn't need to deal with<br/>that right now. Ranma hopped up on wall, waved the officer, and ran for it<br/>down the fence line, between buildings, across a couple of canals and up<br/>onto the roof tops until she reached the business district. If that guy<br/>actually managed to follow her through all that, she would go to school just<br/>for his skills alone. About five minutes later he hadn't shown up so she<br/>figured she was in the clear.<p>A bit of wandering brought Ranma to a bus stop and a set of stairs that led<br/>up to Hikawa Shrine. The name sounded familiar to Ranma and after a few<br/>minutes though she recalled that they had traveled through this area a few<br/>years ago, they had stopped at the Shrine for a few hours before moving on<br/>in the middle of the night. Ranma snapped her fingers remembered a set of<br/>scrolls in her pack she had been learning from, they specialized in mediation<br/>techniques that she had been using to gain control over her Ki and that<br/>damned Neko-ken of hers. She had the techniques down, so figured that<br/>returning them would restore some of her tarnished honor.<p>With those techniques she had learned how to review her life from different<br/>perspectives, she couldn't believe the sheer number of time her idiot father<br/>had tricked her into stealing something by turning it into a game, or the<br/>people she had hurt without knowing it. Ukyo, her old friend had been<br/>surprise had had her so angry that she had destroyed several trees with her<br/>fists before she calmed down. Relieving that little problem was going to be<br/>a pain in the ass, but her renouncing the Saotome name had solved a number<br/>of problems for her and placed them back where they belonged, at the panda's<br/>feet.<p>The stairs were a good training exercise, Ranma ran up them in two minutes<br/>flat. It took most normal people five minutes to do it normally, as she hit<br/>the top, she saw a dark haired girl about to come down and flipped over her<br/>in a daring acrobatic way. The girl was so surprised she fell down in<br/>surprise, Ranma just smirked as she landed.<p>"Good morning, do you know where I can find the head priest?" Ranma asked<br/>the girl. She was very pretty, but there was this cruel glint in her eyes<br/>that disturbed her a little. The girl was wearing a school uniform of gray<br/>plaid and had dropped her book bag, her skirt had hitched itself up in the<br/>fall and her white panties were showing.<p>"Just who the hell do you think you are, this is shrine, not a gym or a<br/>battle ground. You just don't go around scaring people like that, get out of<br/>here and go away!" Rei yelled, her face turning red as she notices her<br/>skirt.<p>"I just stopped by to see the head priest, you caught me by surprise there<br/>and I didn't have time to react much, so I flipped over you."<p>"Humph!" Rei said, grabbed her bag and ran down the stairs. She stopped<br/>just out of sight and wondered why the red head was here of all places. She<br/>ran into the trees at the side of the stairs and made her way back up so she<br/>could keep an eye on the girl, at the same time she pulled out her<br/>communicator.<p>Ranma just giggled as the girl left.<p>"May I help you cutie?" Asked an old bald man, with a lecherous grin as<br/>she looked her over.<p>Ranma glared at him until he backed down. "Yes, I need to return something<br/>to you."<p>"What would that be?" The old man asked, his eyes glued to her tits.<p>"A couple years ago my idiot father passed through here and stole something<br/>from you, I was just going to return them to you."<p>"Stole..." The old man's eyes brows rose for a second, them his eyes turned<br/>to stone and in a totally different tone of voice he said a name.<br/>"Genma...Saotome."<p>"I see you know the idiot, I figured you would." Ranma handed over a small<br/>bundle of scrolls. "These are yours I believe."<p>"Um..."<p>"That's my good deed for the day, now I must be off." Ranma said and<br/>started to walk off.<p>"Wait!"<p>"What?"<p>"Are you Ranma Saotome?"<p>"Not any more old man, not any more."<p>"Why did you return these, what about the other stuff your father stole?"<p>"That is the only thing I can remember him taking, what are the other<br/>items?"<p>"He also took a hundred thousand in yen out of our savings, most of the<br/>silverware, and the sacred texts."<p>"He probably sold them somewhere, he had this habit of ditching me for<br/>days on end to do odd jobs and such, while I was training in one technique<br/>or another. At least that's what he said he was doing, but I have my doubts<br/>now."<p>"I may be old, but I remember Ranma Saotome quite well and you are not<br/>him."<p>"Ever hear of Jusenkyo?"<p>"No, what is that?"<p>"The cursed springs training grounds, it's a nasty place. Pops and I picked<br/>up a curse there, it is because of that place that I no longer travel with<br/>the idiot."<p>"A curse can not turn someone into a totally new shape, now why are you<br/>trying to help those two thieves?"<p>"Believe what you will, I returned what I could of your property, if your<br/>going to get mad about it, that's your problem, not mime. I renounced the<br/>the family name when I was cursed. Good day." Ranma said and turned to walk<br/>off again.<p>"Wait!"<p>"What!" Ranma growled.<p>"Thank you for showing that there is someone in your family that holds<br/>honor."<p>"Old man, I renounced my family name so it no longer matters. I gave up<br/>everything when I did it, I'm not even a man anymore because of those<br/>springs. Still, here's some good news for you, pops picked up a curse<br/>himself and now turns into a giant panda with a splash of cold water. If you<br/>ever see him again, just toss a cup of water on him and laugh."<p>"Will you tell me more of this curse of yours and this Jusenkyo?"<p>"Why?"<p>"These scrolls are prized possessions for Shinto Temple like this and cost a<br/>fortune to replace. I still haven't had a chance to get new ones and my<br/>granddaughters training has suffered for it. Also, the seals on these have<br/>been forced open, that means that someone has seen the techniques within, a<br/>I right?"<p>"Yes, though it was open when I took them from the old fart, I used the<br/>techniques to help cure me of some problems that I had developed over the<br/>years."<p>"Like what?"<p>"I'd rather not talk about it." Ranma said with a shudder.<p>"The main thing these techniques teach is Ki control and I can tell just<br/>from looking at you that you have mastered the techniques. Your body is over<br/>flowing with Ki, I can feel it and I've never met anyone as strong as you.<br/>How is it you have achieved this much skill?"<p>"My martial arts school is called 'Anything Goes' and my pops has taught me<br/>in it for over ten years now. I have learned the majority of several other<br/>schools as well, this has given me a major advantage in a fight. Still, I<br/>think my dunking in that spring knocked something loose in my mind because<br/>accessing my Ki became much easier after I turned female, I can do Ki<br/>attacks and Ki defenses quite easily now."<p>"That's amazing, can you show me?"<p>"Well, nothing fancy, but I can call up a Ki ball with no problems."<p>"A ball of Ki, you can't be that strong even with what I'm...seeing..." The<br/>old man's eyes widen to dinner plates as Ranma glares at him and holds up<br/>her hand. Red sparks of light begin arching from finger to finger for<br/>several seconds before collecting at the palm of her hand and pull into a<br/>small ball of red energy.<p>"C-can you teach me how to do that?"<p>"It takes emotion."<p>"Emotion?"<p>"I read though those scrolls of yours and several other I have and all of<br/>them described two ways to access Ki and use it. There is your way, which<br/>focus' all your energy into a point and you use it manipulate your fire<br/>readings and such. The second is scoffed at for being a short cut and not as<br/>powerful as the first way. This is the short cut, it uses one's strongest<br/>emotions blended together to form a desired effect." Ranma concentrates and<br/>the ball flares for a second and shrinks down into a tiny pinprick of light<br/>bright enough to cause Ranma to be cast into shadows.<p>"Wha..."<p>"This is your way, with me focusing everything I have into my hand. It is<br/>ten times as strong as the Ki ball, but not as useful and a lot harder to<br/>control. I can feel your strength old man and you have a lot of experience<br/>using your Ki in this way, but none in the other. You need to practice both<br/>or they can't work with each other, there has to be a balance." Ranma said,<br/>she figured that if the old man picked up the technique, it would help him<br/>to forgive the Saotome family for it's crimes. "Will that help to pay back<br/>some of what the panda did to you?"<p>"Indeed it will, I can already see uses for both techniques."<p>"Excellent, then I'll be off."<p>The old man grinned again and sidled up close to her. "You wouldn't happen<br/>to want to be an acolyte would you?"<p>"Nope, I have to find a job and find a place to stay, but thanks for the<br/>offer."<p>"The job does pay you know?"<p>Ranma stopped and looked at him over her shoulder. "How much?"<p>"Enough to help you out, so long as you stay here and help. I also want you<br/>you to teach me and Rei how to use that second method you just showed me."<p>"For how long?"<p>"Say, six months?"<p>"Can I use the woods to practice my martial arts?"<p>"Sure, we even have practice dummies and other materials for you to use."<p>"Agreed."<p>**********<p>Ice cream, it was the one thing Ranma loved above the Art, but not by much.<br/>She loved to eat it by the bowl or dish, or even in a cone if it was large<br/>enough. After getting a place to stay and even a job, she figured it was<br/>time to spend a little of her cash and celebrate a little. So she was<br/>walking down the street licking a giant ice cream cone with a big grin on<br/>her face. She loved ice cream, as a guy it was unmanly to eat, unless the<br/>old man sole a pint or two and decided to share with her at the time.<p>The old man, grandpa as he wanted to be called, wanted her to get back in<br/>school. All she had to do was pick out one of the schools in the area, but<br/>had suggested Juban High as a good place to start, then the catholic school<br/>his grand daughter went to, or another just a bit further up the road from<br/>there. She couldn't even remember the last two's names and figured the<br/>Juban High would be a good place to start. She arrived at around 9am and<br/>wasn't surprised to find the gates locked up tight to keep the students<br/>inside to learn. She didn't know it, but she was already making an<br/>impression on the male half of the students as she stood there, they had<br/>noticed her and swarmed to the windows for better look.<p>Ranma was in her usual clothing, black baggy pants and red silk shirt, but<br/>had added a black hair band and bows to her hair to give it a better look<br/>for a girl. She also had on red arm bands and sunglasses to give her a<br/>mysterious look. With an easy kick, she flipped over the gate and sauntered<br/>into the school. Since the gate was over fifteen feet high and had been<br/>designed to keep the students from climbing it, the jump was breathtaking<br/>since she did it without dropping her ice cream.<p>She strolled down the halls until she located the office and walked inside.<br/>The secretary looked up in surprise as she entered. "Where is your uniform<br/>young lady?" She snapped.<p>"Since I'm here to register, I don't have one yet." Ranma snapped back.<p>"Alright, here fill out this paper work." Ranma took half an hour to fill<br/>in the blanks and let the lady do her job. She sat down, leaned back, and<br/>was instantly asleep.<p>"Mrs. Ranma?"<p>"What?" Ranma asked without opening her eyes.<p>"What is your family name?"<p>"Its..." Uh oh, Ranma thought, she hadn't planned on this. "...Ranma<br/>Masaki. Yeah."<p>"Mazaki?"<p>"Yep."<p>The secretary gave her a weird look, shrugged, and made up a folder and<br/>handed her some papers to sign. "Am I to assume you are currently on your<br/>own?"<p>"I'm staying at a local Shinto Temple while I'm in school, after that I<br/>don't know."<p>A tall lady with long green hair walked into the room and handed a folder<br/>to the secretary. "Here is Miss. Misaki's school records Mrs. Taki."<p>"Thank you Mrs. Meioh, where were they I didn't find them in the incoming<br/>students files."<p>"Miss. Masaki is one of my students, I was over looking her file and making<br/>some notes."<p>"Huh?" Said Ranma, totally lost at this point and wondering who this woman<br/>was and how she knew she needed to help.<p>"Come along Ranma, my name is Setsuna Meioh, I'm going to be your school<br/>counselor."<p>"Um...alright." She stood and followed the tall woman to a set of offices<br/>several doors down.<p>As they entered she closed and locked the door and motioned for Ranma to<br/>sit down. "Every now and then someone comes here and makes friend, I won't<br/>mention names Miss. Masaki, but your friend has requested that we let you<br/>get set up in a new life."<p>"Wha..."<p>Setsuna smiled and handed Ranma large envelope. "In there is everything you<br/>will need to get set up in your new life, identification and such set up<br/>under your new name."<p>"How did..."<p>"Your new friend is worried about you and arranged everything ahead of time<br/>and apologizes for any problems that may arise from this help." Setsuna<br/>handed Ranma her class schedule and escorted her out of the room, talking<br/>nonsense and lying through her teeth even as she pushed the confused girl<br/>out into the hall and shut the door in her face. "Thank you and good luck at<br/>the uniform store Ranma, I'll talk to you tomorrow." Slam.<p>"Huh?" Ranma said and blinked a few times.<p>'What the hell was that about?' Ranma thought as she went over to the<br/>stairs and sat down. She dug into the envelope and found to her surprise a<br/>wallet, male version, filled with about 50,000 yen, a student ID with her<br/>picture on it and the name she had just made up on the spot. There was also<br/>a library card, and a bank book registered to her, it had a 500,000 yen<br/>balance. There was also an ATM card and a check book with everything made<br/>out to her. Every bit of it looked legal.<p>She also found a note addressed to a Ranma Saotome and paled in shock.<p>Ranma Saotome:<p>This may come as a shock to you, but you don't need to panic. The Sailor<br/>Scouts set this up and would like for you to forgive them for any pain or<br/>fear their offer caused you. Everything in this packet is legal and yours<br/>free of charge, we will be contacting you again to explain in more detail<br/>what the others messed up yesterday.<p>Your friend<p>Ranma sighed, this was getting weirder than usual and she had thought she<br/>was used to weird. What could all of this mean? Those girl's had said she<br/>was a Princess of all things and that was impossible, she was born a boy and<br/>transformed into this shape. If anything she was a prince under a curse, and<br/>even that was a bit far fetched. She had grown used to this female body over<br/>time and could live with it if she had to, but this crap about her being a<br/>Princess was a little weird. She would have to give those girls the truth<br/>just to get them off her back, a guy couldn't be a Princess.<p>She put the stuff away and pulled out the last item, the address of the<br/>uniform shop and just what she had to get. To her surprise there was even<br/>some sizes written down for her, she recognized them as her bust and waist<br/>sized and blushed a little. Even after all these months she still wore her<br/>boxers and no bra, but they were a required part of the uniform so she had<br/>to wear them or get in trouble. Standing up she ran outside and jumped on<br/>top of the fence, looked at the address, and ran in the right direction<br/>while on top of the fence.<p>The place was located a couple miles away so Ranma arrived in about ten<br/>minutes, still on top of a fence, she had just jumped over the various<br/>intersections. She looked the place over and wondered why she was feeling<br/>this weird foreboding the closer she got to the place, but shrugged it off,<br/>it was probably nothing of interest to her. It was decent looking place and<br/>Ranma headed inside and looked around, a sales lady headed over way and<br/>smiled as she saw a sale. Ranma smiled back and handed her the card.<p>"I'm starting at Juban in the morning and need a couple of uniforms."<p>"Lets step into the changing room and let me see if these sizes are correct<br/>and I'll get your uniform for you."<p>"Thank you."<p>Several minutes later Ranma was blushing as the sales lady held up a pair<br/>of white and yellow boxers, her eyebrow twitching.<p>"Um..." Ranma started.<p>"Let me get you some proper underwear and I won't ask why your wearing<br/>these."<p>"..." Ranma said, still blushing as she stood there in the nude.<p>The uniform was a blue skirt with a white top, a blue neck tie and was the<br/>most mortifying thing Ranma had ever put on. She felt stupid and wanted to<br/>burn the thing, her new panties were itchy and bra was pinching her in<br/>places she wanted to forget about. Of course that was her opinion, to the<br/>sales lady she was nodding and smiling at the gorgeous girl in front of her<br/>who looked like she had been born to wear that skirt. Her legs were<br/>perfectly proportioned and her but was just the right size to drive all<br/>thoughts out of any male that saw her, the lady smiled. This one was<br/>perfect, she was just a tomboy waiting to bloom, then Ranma itched her<br/>crotch and farted, ruining the image. The red head smiled and giggled a<br/>little as she adjusted her breasts by lifting them and adjusting th bra.<p>"H-how is the fit?"<p>"A little snug, but nothing I can't live with, though the bra is a bit to<br/>frilly for my tastes."<p>"Oh, I thought it was perfect for you."<p>"I don't wear them all that often, my idiot father trained me in the Art<br/>for over ten years, he treated me as a boy for the whole time so I don't'<br/>have much experience with these things. I'd rather wear a boy's uniform if<br/>you have one, that's what I did at the last school I was at."<p>"With that body?" The sales lady said, sighing at the stupidity of a man<br/>that would hide this magnificent creature.<p>"Yeah, can you believe it?" Ranma said, oblivious to the sales ladies tone.<br/>She adjusted the panties thought her skirt and sighed in relief even as the<br/>lady twitched.<p>"I can tell you have never worn this type of stuff before, you need some<br/>practice."<p>"Oh?"<p>"The more you adjust your underwear, the more attention you will draw to<br/>yourself and what your adjusting. You will also need to keep your legs<br/>closed, a skirt hikes up when you sit down and you could accidentally flash<br/>your panties to some unsuspecting man when you don't want to."<p>"I didn't know that, but I have a way to keep it from happening so don't<br/>worry about it." Ranma said, covertly looking at the pile of clothing that<br/>had been brought in. The PE shorts would solve a lot of problems if she wore<br/>them under the skirt. She adjusted the cuffs on her shirt and decided she<br/>would be putting her Martial Arts Sewing to use tonight to solve some<br/>problems with the outfit. "Is there a jacket that goes with this?"<p>"Yes, though it costs extra."<p>"Get me one, make it a size bigger than it needs to be, I'll be making some<br/>adjustments to it."<p>"It's against school rules to make to many alterations."<p>"I'm a martial artist ma'am, I need something I can fight in. The<br/>alterations will not be noticeable on the outside of the clothing."<p>The jacket was in as bad a shape as the skirt and the shirt, all of it was<br/>to constricting to be used in combat. She had a lot of work to do tonight if<br/>she was going to be ready by morning. Suddenly there is a scream from<br/>outside the small room and Ranma runs out in her new uniform to look around,<br/>she spots the sales lady just as she collapses at the feet of this thing<br/>standing over her. It is about seven foot high, covered in scales and<br/>female, differently female. The giant tits and large bra are a dead give<br/>away.<p>Blushing furiously, Ranma gets in a set stance as she looks in her<br/>direction and grins with pointed teeth. The dark energy wafting off the<br/>thing nearly knocks Ranma off her feet and makes her mouth go dry, but the<br/>excitement of a fight kicks in and has her more than ready. "So are you like<br/>the stupid electric monster I destroyed a yesterday?" Ranma says and smiles<br/>evilly.<p>"YOUR the one that killed Electrica? For that you get to die now, as<br/>painfully as possible, I'm Silky Doll and your dead!" The monster woman<br/>yelled, her large breasts bouncing wildly.<p>Ranma found her eyes glued to the large bouncing objects and blushed an<br/>even brighter shade of red. "Um..."<p>Silky Doll raised her arm and fired off a beam of light that Ranma dodged<br/>without even thinking about it, she couldn't stop blushing. Doll screamed<br/>and ran forward and threw a punch at Ranma, but she twisted, grabbed Doll's<br/>arm, and threw her over her shoulder and through the front door. It exploded<br/>outward in a shower of splinters as Doll flew across the street and slammed<br/>into a wall, Ranma came running out of the destroyed door. Her blush was gone<br/>as she started to get more into the fight, she would have to be careful if<br/>she continued this fight. That thing was a very good looking monster and<br/>Ranma was reluctant to take it out because of that.<p>The pointed teeth were a good distraction though, they would allow her to<br/>keep her mind out of the gutter while she fought. There it was across the<br/>street, Ranma didn't think she had thrown it that far, she hopped up on a<br/>car and jumped across the street. She was cursing as she landed, her skirt<br/>had billowed up as she came down and flashed her new white panties to<br/>everyone in the smal crowd that was swiftly gathering. The loud gasp of male<br/>hormones was something she didn't need to deal with right now, so she got in<br/>fighting stance and let he aura flare up around her.<p>Sensing an opening, Ranma ran forward and started to beat on the monster at<br/>super speed, several loud bangs are heard as she breaks the sound barrier<br/>with her punches and kicks. For Silky Doll, she is unable to react fast<br/>enough and soon falls to dust, releasing the energy she had gathered<br/>earlier. Ranma smirks and wonders how many of these wimps she will have to<br/>take out, no matter how pretty they were.<p>"How dare you interfere again!" Yelled a male voice from above her.<p>Ranma rolled her eyes, looked up a Jedite and smiled at him, the crowd<br/>vanished as quickly as it had formed. Jedite floated down to the ground, his<br/>eyes glinting with hatred as he looked Ranma over. "Hello blondie, what is<br/>it this time?"<p>"I will teach you the meaning of pain as I kill you!" Jedite yelled and<br/>launched forward.<p>Stepping forward, Ranma broke through Jedite's defenses and hit him in the<br/>face with a straight arm to th jaw, kicked him in the balls, and body<br/>slammed the man into the concrete so hard it shattered around him. The<br/>difference this time was that Jedite was prepared for the girl's fighting<br/>ability, so his magic deflected most of the damage. He jumped to his feet<br/>and fired out several blasts of energy, Ranma dodged and weaved as fast as<br/>she could, but wasn't' fast enough to get out of the line of fire fast<br/>enough. A large blast caught her in the chest and exploded, blowing the body<br/>back several yards, she landed in a heap but was able to roll to her feet.<br/>Her clothing was shredded and her bra was showing through some of the tears<br/>and rips, the skirt was now a weird looking mini skirt. Ranma could feel the<br/>blood running down her leg from the cut she had taken on her upper thigh,<br/>her grin was a mile wide and was enough that it frightened Jedite more than<br/>he was able to admit.<p>To Be Continued...<p>Notes - This story is going well, but a little slow since it is not one of<br/>my main ones, it is just an idea I'm toying with at the moment. I may cross<br/>this with Tenchi, but at the moment I don't know, well see how things work<br/>out in the future. For anyone familiar with my stories, I like to get a lot<br/>of fighting done, this story is no exception. If I write the whole thing<br/>out, I will probably take it clear though the death of Beryal and Metalia,<br/>the main history will be very changed as I go along. There will also be<br/>plenty of lite hentai parts, after all Ranma is to new at being a girl to<br/>cover up thing he used to care less about.<p>Notes - Setsuna is a kind of helpful background character that is there to<br/>make sure things go as they are supposed to, the inners don't even know she<br/>exists yet and those that do can be counted on one hand.
