</div>Notes-There are many different ideas out there that have been used to change<br/>or alter Ranma's fate in some way. The idea that he is stuck as a girl is<br/>one of them, it is one that I both like and dislike equally. It is a good<br/>thing if it helps Ranma to grow out of his shell and makes him happy in some<br/>way, but bad because it has a tendency to ruin the entire idea of what Ranma<br/>1/2 is. I debated on this idea for several days before deciding to do it,<br/>but it had to still be Ranma in some way and that meant that I had to replace<br/>some of the elements that I took away by turning him female permanently. To<br/>that end, like most of my other stories, this is a SM crossover and that<br/>will be used to make a new back drop for this story. It is set during the<br/>first season with Jedite and the other generals so that I can build a bit of<br/>history for her.<p>What does this mean for the rest of Ranma's history, rivals, and<br/>girlfriends? It will be altered to fit the new circumstances as best as one<br/>can without destroying it entirely. This mixed in with Sailor Moon is going<br/>to cause some true chaos in everything . It will also mean that certain<br/>characters will be OOC as some like to say, I will keep the basic<br/>personality traits that make them who and what they are though.<p>Princess of the Moon<br/>Prologue<br/>By C. Rose<br/>(c)2001<p>**********<p>'Panda no baka' went through Ranma's mind as the guide tried once again to<br/>pour hot water over her head. She sighed as the wanted transformation did<br/>not take place, it looked like she was going to be a girl for the rest of<br/>her life now. She sat dejectedly on the little stool in the guide's hut,<br/>anger and depression written on her face. They just had to come here, it was<br/>a great training ground, yeah right she thought. She watched as the guide<br/>poured hot water over the panda and he transformed back into her father, an<br/>aura of anger formed around her as she glared at the old man and made him<br/>cower against the back of the hut.<p>Ranma just couldn't believe this was happening to him, just what Kami had<br/>he pissed off to deserve this? She had been having a perfectly normal fight<br/>with the asshole that was her father and knocked him into a spring,<br/>perfectly fine. Then she had finally heard the guide shouting out a warning<br/>just as this giant panda jumps out of the pool, it's body glowing with chi,<br/>and back hands her clear across the small valley where she smashes into a<br/>wooden fence that was being used to block off several springs. These were<br/>the ones that were far worse than the regular ones, these were the monster<br/>springs, the mind altering springs, and the permanent springs.<p>Splash down had been a shock of cold water and an intense feeling of<br/>numbness as it spread through her body and altered her. Spring of Drowned<br/>Girl, Ranma has surfaced and shaken her head and wondered what had happened.<br/>She could tell that something was off right away, just standing had been a<br/>chore when she realized that her sense of balance was off, lower than it<br/>should have been. Then the second part of her new curse, Panda no Baka, had<br/>hit her and altered her whole world. Her outlook had changed just slightly,<br/>but enough to let her know that she had no way to go back to what she was.<p>The guide was as apologetic as he could get, bowing to her and trying to<br/>tell them that he had tried to warn them. Ranma didn't blame the guide, she<br/>remembered ignoring the little man when they arrived. She was a girl now,<br/>forever, but that wasn't the whole problem. If she could change back and<br/>forth she might have been more forgiving, but could feel this feeling inside<br/>of her that she couldn't place. As a man she had never felt anything like<br/>this, it was power, she was sure of that, but what kind was a total mystery.<p>"Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you old man?" Ranma snarled,<br/>her eyes burning with a silver light.<p>Genma screamed like a little girl and fell to his knees in his patented<br/>'Crouch of the Wild Tiger' and started whimpering and begging for her<br/>forgiveness. Ranma didn't know it but she was blazing with massive aura and<br/>reminded him of some of the masters escapades in the past. Her new form was<br/>breathtaking to say the least, a little taller than her old male one, a<br/>dancers lithe body, a set of large breasts, and red hair that had burst out<br/>of it's customary pig tail and grown before their eyes until it reached the<br/>back of her calves. It was waving in the power of the aura she was putting<br/>out and making her drop dead gorgeous, the power nearly blasting him off his<br/>knees even as he cowered before her.<p>"Well?" Ranma yelled.<p>"I-I-I..." Genma gibbered as Ranma growled and kicked him with the full<br/>power of her aura behind it. With a grunt of pain, Genma was sent flying<br/>through the roof of the hut and far into the sky on a flight that would last<br/>some minutes and end in a village of Amazons some miles away who where even<br/>them just beginning get into their yearly Martial Arts Tournament. All the<br/>women were wearing their armor and weapons as they heard a scream and looked<br/>up into the sky. Genma fell out of the sun and impacted the table holding<br/>the feast of food that had been prepared for the winner, they were not<br/>happy. They took much satisfaction in making their displeasure known to the<br/>unconscious man that had interrupted them.<p>Back at the springs Ranma had taken both packs and emptied them on the<br/>ground to search for anything that she might need. She rummaged around until<br/>she found what she was looking for, her father's money belt and the money it<br/>contained (stolen of course). She also set aside her father's scroll case,<br/>Tanto, and several books. She then spent the next several minutes examining<br/>her new body, and decided that there was only a few ways she could survive<br/>this without going insane. Oh, she was mad right now, but had done something<br/>like this in the past when she was subjected to the Neko-ken, she had barely<br/>survived that because she had tried to hold all the pain and fear inside<br/>her. Luckily that old lady that had helped her had been smart enough to<br/>teach her some special ways to deal with it. This curse could be hated and<br/>rejected like she did with the Neko-ken, or she could accept it, adjust, and<br/>move on with a laugh. It would serve the old fart if she never came back to<br/>him, all his plans were dead now, the perfect revenge she figured. She<br/>grinned, the old fart had started to talk in his sleep lately, it had been<br/>quite an education learning about how he thought of her.<p>There were some good qualities she was just beginning to realize, the<br/>transformation had altered her mind and implanted a large amount of<br/>information. A good amount of it was shocking the hell out of her,<br/>everything she didn't want to know about girls was there, it made her<br/>shudder when she realized once again that this to was permanent. There was<br/>also information on skills she had never heard of, like how to talk one's<br/>way out of a fight and lots of information on math, science, even a bit of<br/>magic lore. The last would have to be looked at carefully, maybe she could<br/>find a cure for being turned into this..freak. Ranma felt herself starting<br/>to cry and forced herself to stop, she would stay in control because she was<br/>a man no matter what she looked like.<p>She had no intention of ever obeying the panda again, what little trust she<br/>had felt for him before coming here was gone. Ten years on the road had<br/>taught her enough martial arts to survive without the old man and she wasn't<br/>going to give it up now that she was missing some vital parts, and the first<br/>order of business was getting herself back up to fighting trim in this new<br/>body. The lack of proper balance was driving her up the wall, to even get a<br/>portion of her edge back she was going to have to retrain her body in<br/>everything she could remember.<p>Digging back into her pack, Ranma decided that she needed to put something<br/>else on and pulled some of her good clothes out. She cursed this new body as<br/>she lost her balance and fell over when she pulled her gi off and tossed the<br/>top off into the trees, her new tits bouncing free and giving the guide a<br/>free show. He wisely kept his mouth shut and admired the red headed beauty<br/>as she moved. She then pulled on a red silk shirt, arm bracers, and black<br/>pants. She had no feminine modesty so didn't even thing twice about stripping<br/>out of her wet boxers and putting on some dry ones right there in front of<br/>the hut.<p>Off on the other side of the springs a bandana clad boy was overlooking the<br/>springs when he was hit in the head by a gi top. He growled about idiots and<br/>turned to teach the upstart a lesson in manners when he saw Ranma. His eyes<br/>widened into saucer plates and he gaped at the girl's beauty as she changed<br/>clothes, but when he saw the whole show and fainted when blood exploded out<br/>of his nose, visions of perfect breasts bouncing, rounded cheeks curved just<br/>right, and all the poof he needed to know that she was the natural red head<br/>of his dreams. Luckily he fell backwards and landed on his back, otherwise<br/>he would have landed in one of the springs.<p>After having all that hot water dumped on her in a futile attempt to change<br/>her back, her hair was very wet and plastered to her back, it was just how<br/>she liked it when she needed to tie it up. Pulling it back tightly, she<br/>started to use the string to section in off into five inch segments, but<br/>there was so much there that she had to force it into the shape she wanted<br/>and after about half an hour she had a super long braided tail that hung<br/>down to below her waist. Ever the martial artist, she tied a small throwing<br/>star into the end of it so she could use it as a weapon if she needed to.<br/>She finished and called out for the guide, but he was just sitting on a<br/>large rock smoking his pipe.<p>"Guide!" Ranma yelled, waving her hand in front of his face.<p>The guide screamed and fell off the rock with a loud thump. "Yes Mr.<br/>Customer?" He asked, bowing low in apology, also to hide his blush.<p>"Where is the nearest place I can get some training in without being<br/>hassled? I don't want to deal with people right now."<p>The guide sweated and was tempted to send her to the Amazon village, but<br/>her little display of power earlier had frightened him. He may have taken an<br/>oath to send those most likely to be good stock to the village, but even he<br/>knew when someone could very well take their anger out on him. He pointed<br/>off in the direction the customers had used to enter the valley. "Off that<br/>direction is replacement for this training ground, two day travel if walk.<br/>Much better challenge than this cursed place."<p>Ranma nodded and headed back over to the packs and stuffed anything in his<br/>that he might have need of. He took all the scrolls and most of his pops<br/>money, though he did leave him enough to buy a meal or two, like he would<br/>use it for that. "The panda is likely to return, do not tell him where I<br/>went, he went to far this time and I am breaking all ties with him." Ranma<br/>told the guide.<p>With that Ranma shouldered the heavy backpack and headed out looking<br/>pissed, her foot found the one root in a three mile radius that was sticking<br/>above the ground by several inches to trip over and she smashed into the<br/>ground face first with a howl of shock. Climbing to her feet she staggered<br/>off complaining about being top heavy and being turned into a klutz all in<br/>one fell swoop, "Panda no Baka!" Ranma yelled out. She then walked on for<br/>several more minutes before she saw a man passed out on the edge of a cliff<br/>over looking the valley, there was blood all over his shirt, but a giant<br/>grin on his face. She wandered over to see if he was alright, that was a lot<br/>of blood to lose as well.<p>"...so round and perfect...hehehe..." He giggled at whatever was going<br/>through his mind.<p>She felt this urge to kick the pervert over the hill, but refrained when<br/>she realized she knew him from somewhere. That bandana and those fangs were<br/>very familiar, but she just couldn't place them right off the bat. She<br/>shrugged and dragged him off into the forest and away from the cliff,<br/>hopeful he would avoid the springs. When she went to retrieve his pack she<br/>got her first shock, it was heavier than hers, by almost ten times as much,<br/>it explained his well muscled arms and back. She looked him over jealously,<br/>just that morning she had been blessed with as similar build, but now it was<br/>gone. Though she did seem to still possess much of her skills and power as a<br/>girl, she just hoped she would be able to compensate for it by the time she<br/>reached Japan again.<p>Something about this situation felt wrong to her and she decided to leave<br/>before her cursed existence caused her even more problems, the last several<br/>years had been nothing but constant fighting and training, most of the<br/>problems had stemmed from her father in one way or another too. She grabbed<br/>her pack and set off out of the area, leaving the Lost Boy to wake up alone<br/>and blushing down to the tips of his toes as he headed west, left the area<br/>and half an hour later was over looking an ice field in the middle of<br/>nowhere. He had been here several times in the last weeks and used his<br/>special gear in his pack to keep warm while he trudged the ten or fifteen<br/>minutes to the nearby jungle and settled down for the night.<p>The next several weeks Ranma spent getting her edge back, retraining her<br/>new body to flow through kata designed for a male body. At first her<br/>wanderings and training had been total hell as she tripped an fell every ten<br/>feet, her balance so messed up that she had to spend an entire day just<br/>learning how to walk properly. After that most every thing else quickly<br/>returned as she adapted it, she even made a delightful discovery. Her speed<br/>had always been pretty good, now she could blur from sight a she practiced.<br/>At night she read through the scroll the panda had in his pack and found<br/>several of them pretty easy to learn, though she would half to change the<br/>main reason for the moves to put the to decent use. Why the old fart had a<br/>technique for stealing panties in his possession, but it could work on other<br/>things as well. He even had a Ki charged speed attack that could push her<br/>speed to astronomical heights, she figured once she mastered it she could<br/>throw over 500 punches in a few seconds flat!<p>Why the hell he hadn't been teaching her these she didn't know, but figured<br/>it had something to do with his always holding back information, even when<br/>she needed it for a fight or just survival. Ranma's training took on an<br/>obsessive quality as she moved across China and avoided most towns she came<br/>across, she had found a number of wanted posters of her father and her old<br/>male half and was glad she had ditched the old man. He would have turned her<br/>in if could get away with it, taking the money and running as fast as he<br/>could. Finally she reached the coast and over looked a small fishing<br/>village, it was just what she needed right then. She set up camp out in the<br/>woods and filled out several post cards she had found in the old man's pack,<br/>they were all the same, so she figured he had just grabbed a bundle for a<br/>rack somewhere and pocketed the lot of them. She thought the panda on the<br/>front was a great omen for the old fart, a kind of forewarning that he hadn't<br/>even known about. It made her grin evilly.<p>She spent a few hours after that practicing her Ki control and was thrilled<br/>when she pushed her punching speed up to over ninty per second, but she was<br/>disappointed in the down side to the technique. For her speed, she lost a<br/>good amount of the power to her punches and wasn't able to do much damage<br/>yet, but the scroll said to keep at it until the force of her blows<br/>returned. After that she filled out a couple of the post cards, one that the<br/>idiot had planned to send to some guy named Tendo with an extra couple of<br/>lines about his killing his son in a training accident and his curse. Ranma<br/>figured it would be good for a couple of laughs when he showed up at their<br/>door as a giant panda. The second was to his mother, letting her know about<br/>the accident, her parting of ways with the panda (he just had to let her<br/>know about that) and that he had no intention of killing herself now that<br/>she had lost her manhood so was giving up the Saotome name.<p>It was a bit harsh, but she figured that any one that would let her suffer<br/>through the tortures of training that Genma had put her through didn't<br/>deserve more than that. The Seppuku contract in the old farts bag had been<br/>an eye opener and made her so mad that it had burst into flame while in her<br/>hands. It had also been the final thing she needed to cut her losses and<br/>ditch the old fart, may he become a panda fuck toy for some lonely monkey.<br/>She was putting some thought into changing her name completely, but wasn't<br/>sure if it would do any good. Even if she changed it, someone would<br/>eventually track her down and figure out who she was and she had no<br/>intentions of getting married to some boy just to keep her secret safe. She<br/>had changed, but not that much, girls still turned her head as easily as<br/>they always had, no matter how much the old man had tried to beat the<br/>reaction out of him.<p>**********<p>It was about midnight several days later when Ranma reached the coast of<br/>Japan and waked ashore glowing a bright red as she used her aura to dry her<br/>clothing. Several of the couples on the beach ran away in fear, screaming<br/>something about a demon. Ranma ignored them as she made her way into the<br/>city, scaring the crap out of everyone that saw her. Since Ranma didn't have<br/>a mirror, she couldn't see what she looked like, but a cat hiding in a<br/>nearby alley was watching her intently and gasped as she saw the small<br/>silver crescent moon on the girl's forehead, tears poured down the cats face<br/>as memories filled her head.<p>Luna ran out of the alley to catch her princess, but had to dive in as the<br/>girl turned to look at her and screamed in fear. Luna spun around to protect<br/>her princess, but found nothing out of the ordinary, she looked back and<br/>blinked. The red headed girl was over half a mile way and accelerating,<br/>screaming in fear about...cats! What was going on here, the princess had<br/>never been afraid of cats before, dragons yes, cats no. She ran after her,<br/>but knew it was hopeless in the end, the girl was just to fast. Luna heaved<br/>a sigh and pulled out her communicator, having your own subspace pocket was<br/>very handy, and hit the all call non-emergency button.<p>"What is it Luna?" Ami Mizuno asked, wiping sleep out of her eyes. Soon<br/>all the other girls except Usagi were listening in.<p>"I just saw the Princess!"<p>"What?" Yelled three very wide awake girls. Rei and Ami looked shocked<br/>beyond belief, Usagi would have complained about losing sleep, but she was<br/>asleep, so didn't say anything.<p>"I was in this alley when I felt this strong aura heading my way and I hid,<br/>a few seconds later this tall red head walks by, she was glowing a bright<br/>red and had the Royal Crescent Moon symbol on her forehead. Just the sight of<br/>it brought back a large chunk of my missing memories."<p>"Where are you Luna, we'll meet you there." Said Ami.<p>"I'm afraid that something weird happened and she ran off screaming." Luna<br/>said nervously, if not for that crescent moon she would have been a little<br/>suspicious of the girl and thought she was a member of the Dark Kingdom.<p>"What do you mean, Luna?" Rei asked as she squinted at Luna.<p>"She seems to be afraid of cats for some reason, took one look at me and<br/>ran off in a panic."<p>"Luna, can you describer her a little better?" Ami asked as she typed in<br/>her mini computer.<p>"Sure, she was about 5'10, 115 pounds, blue eyes, in incredible shape, and<br/>had this long red hair that was tied back in a long pony tail that reached<br/>down to below her waist. She was wearing a red silk Chinese shirt, black<br/>pants, and was bare foot. She also had this strange grace that only the<br/>Princess could have used as she walked." Luna was a trained observer and an<br/>adviser to the Princess when she showed up, she had to know her job. "She<br/>was also carrying this large backpack and glowing a bright red."<p>"Glowing?" Rei asked.<p>"Yes, I'm not sure why, but she didn't seem to be in any danger and there<br/>were no Youma about that I can sense."<p>"Luna you said a backpack, is it possible that she wasn't born in Japan,<br/>but possible China? She was wearing Chinese clothing."<p>"She looked Japanese to me Ami, so I don't know." Off in the distance is<br/>large explosion and Luna picks up the telltale signs of a Youma on the<br/>rampage again. "Looks like I spoke to soon, there's a Youma attack a few<br/>blocks from here."<p>Usagi's communicator beeped and signaled that she had received the message<br/>and would be in the area as soon as she could. Luna wondered what had woken<br/>the girl up, usually a bomb couldn't do it. She took off for the battle so<br/>that she could help the girl's fight it, they were still so green she even<br/>hated to send them out. It took her several minutes to reach the fight, but<br/>she looked around the corner of a building and gasped as she spotted Jedite<br/>laid out on the ground across the street, a familiar back pack on his<br/>chest. The she took in the Youma and gasped.<p>Her princess was fighting it with her bare hands and using skills that she<br/>didn't remember her ever using. There was that bright red aura around her<br/>again and she seemed to be using it to increase her speed and power a<br/>thousand fold. The Youma was one of Jedite's usual kind, sorta female with<br/>odd powers, this one seemed to be able to use electricity as a weapon as it<br/>fired blast after blast at the Princess. The girl was unlike anything Luna<br/>could remember as she dodged at speeds that even the Scouts couldn't match,<br/>she slowly made her way forward every few seconds until she was in the<br/>thing's face and...<p>**********<p>Gasping for air as she leaned against the building, Ranma hoped she had<br/>lost that damned cat. Ever since the stupid Neko-ken training the things<br/>seemed to follower her around like she was cat nip or something. She just<br/>hoped she didn't lose it before she found a way to cure herself of the<br/>blasted fear, if she didn't, she feared what she would do. As soon as she<br/>calmed down again she paled and looked around to see this thing walking down<br/>the street, it was vaguely female and dressed in this red and yellow costume<br/>covered in little black lighting bolts, it was giving off this aura of<br/>evil...no that was coming from above it.<p>She looked up and spotted this blonde haired man hovering arrogantly as he<br/>survayed the area. He hadn't seen her yet, but knew it wouldn't be all that<br/>long before he did. Something deep inside her clicked and Ranma knew she had<br/>to defeat this guy, he was evil and a traitor to boot. She examined the<br/>situation and decided the guy was leaving himself open in his arrogance, a<br/>sneak attack would take him out quickly enough and allow her the time she<br/>needed to take out the monster. She slowly pulled her pack off her back,<br/>spun it a couple of times and threw it at the blonde. It arched up and<br/>impacted right in his chest and sent him slamming into the building and to<br/>the ground, she smiled as her super heavy pack landed on him and knocked the<br/>wind out of him.<p>The monster gaped at her boss and didn't react as Ranma ran up and punched<br/>her in the head and sent her reeling, then she had to take several kicks,<br/>punches, and combos before the girl backed off. The monster straightened and<br/>looked at Ranma, anger evident in her eyes. "Who the hell are you?"<p>"Ranko." Ranma said, figuring a fake name could be used after all.<p>"Die, Ranko!" The monster yelled and started to fire off blasts of<br/>electricity, but Ranma just grinned and dodged them easily. The speed<br/>technique had gotten easier and easier to do since he learned it, she had<br/>even gotten to the point that she could use some force in the blows now and<br/>this was good time to test just how much! She weaved forward though the<br/>thing's pathetic attack and began. Her arms vanished form sight as she used<br/>the thing as a punching bag, completely overwhelming it's total lack of<br/>resistance, she finished it off with a punch to the jaw and heard a loud<br/>cracking sound. The monster fell into a pile of dust at her feet that glowed<br/>for a few seconds before vanishing.<p>Ranma blinked and shrugged, less mess to clean up. "That was easy, I<br/>thought it would put up a better fight than that." Then grinned as she saw<br/>the blonde starting to stand back up, he was holding his head and looked<br/>righteously pissed off, Ranma smirked at him.<p>"Who the hell are you?"<p>"I take it you and your monsters use the same speech writer?" Ranma asked<br/>innocently.<p>"Who are YOU!" Jedite yelled.<p>"No one that matters idiot, if were going to fight, bring it on. I figure<br/>you won't be as well trained as the stupid monster I just took out,<br/>blondie."<p>Luna giggled quietly.<p>Jedite growled and fired off a blast of dark energy, but Ranma dodged it<br/>and was in front of him before he could even gloat about his powers. She<br/>punched him, in the stomach, as hard as she could and grinned evilly as<br/>Jedite fell to his knees and coughed up some green blood. He looked up at<br/>her in fear just before she kicked him in the back and sent him sprawling,<br/>Luna was in awe of her speed and power. Ranma stalked forward and Jedite<br/>panicked, he jumped into the air and vanished through a black portal.<p>"I'll be back!" He yelled as he vanished.<p>"Read enough comic books, you moron?" Ranma muttered to the now empty area<br/>and went to reclaim her pack. "Are you going to come out now, or am I going<br/>to have to come up there?" Ranma called out and looked to the roof of a<br/>nearby building. Luna noticed Mars and Mercury had been watching the fight,<br/>Moon was there, but she was asleep again.<p>"May we come down and talk?" Mercury asked.<p>"Go ahead."<p>The scouts jumped the three stories to the ground and landed easily<br/>enough, this impressed Ranma quite a bit, but she started to snicker as they<br/>got closer and fell to her knees a few seconds later. The Scouts stopped and<br/>looked at each other in confusion, Moon let off a loud snore from the roof.<br/>"What's wrong?" Mercury asked.<p>"How can you walk around in public in those outfits, I've never seen<br/>something so stupid in all my life." Ranma laughed out, rolling around now.<br/>"I wouldn't be caught dead in one of those get ups."<p>"These are our uniforms, they are the very height of fashion and magical<br/>protection!" Mars yells out.<p>"But...Bwahahahahaha...s-sure Thumbalina, then you go out and perform swan<br/>lake, right? Bwahahahahah." By this time Ranma had tears rolling down his<br/>face and it was getting harder to breath. "...and w-what's the one on the<br/>roof? Is she some kind of Snorlax or something?"<p>Mercury blushed at that, Usagi's mom had forced a valium down the girl's<br/>throat at dinner and she hadn't been very coherent since. "Um...heheh...can<br/>we talk about what where here for?"<p>Still gasping for air, Ranma couldn't stop herself from giggling at the<br/>girls a little more before she calmed down enough to talk. "What did you<br/>want to talk about?"<p>"Um...well...we...thought you might be one of us and came to find out."<br/>Mercury said quietly.<p>"You've got to be kidding me?" Ranma said.<p>"No, one of our...friends saw you earlier and said she saw pretty good<br/>proof that you could be the girl we have been looking for." Mars said.<p>"And who might I be, if I am the one your looking for?"<p>"The Princess." Mars said, with a straight face.<p>Ranma lost it and started laughing again, she was rolling a few seconds<br/>later. "Sorry girl's, I don't have time to play dress up right now." Ranma<br/>said as she snickered, rolled to her feet and shouldered her pack. "Maybe we<br/>can play again some other time, Bye." She jumped over them, rebounded off a<br/>building and jumped to a nearby roof and vanished before they could even<br/>come up with a wave goodbye.<p>"Luna how can that girl be our Princess?" Yelled Mars, who was impressed<br/>with the jump the girl had made.<p>The cat came running up, trying not to giggle at the girls. "She had a<br/>silver crescent moon on her forehead, that makes her a very good candidate<br/>since only those of the Royal Moon Family have it on their heads."<p>"I can't believe for a second that this girl is the Princess, she is rude,<br/>mean, insulting, and doesn't even know how to dress as a girl, let alone a<br/>princess."<p>"I disagree Mars." Mercury said as she looked at her computer.<p>"Why?"<p>"That girl is nearly Sailor Moon's equal in power according to this and<br/>hasn't even tapped her full powers yet."<p>To Be Continued...
